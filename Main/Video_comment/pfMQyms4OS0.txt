It's being honest this teen did the right thing 🙂👍🏾
What are they paying for
Seen her id after robbing it and wanted something
My son found a wallet  at the park  , he was with my granddaughter  and found  the wallet,  later he dropped it at the local police station.
I grew up in a privileged community in Florida in the 1970's. I really don't think any of my contemporaries would have returned the purse, including myself. We just weren't raised with those kind of values back then, at least not in my community.
Thank you, young man ❤
I can only give 1 thumbs up. I would like to give two. 👍👍
Well done lad.  👍
Nice fake story
Awesome
Notice how there's no black people involved in this
Hmm what's interesting same race?🤔
Two weeks later……. Teen arrested for robbing woman at store lol
I’d keep it
Good Boy, obviously RAISED RIGHT- 🙏 AMEN!   Whats sad is this is not usual and made headline news bc "OMG SOMEONE DID THE RIGHT THING"!!! - Showing again, how sick & grotesque our (🇺🇸💔🤢) society has now become.....I BLAME THE LACK OF CHILD REERING & HATE PROJECTED ON CHILDREN "BY THEIR SOULESS VIAL PARENTS UNFIT PARENTS" 🤢🤢🤢 So get it straight 😖😵‍💫 It's wrong to say, """"THERE'S HOPE FOR OUR YOUNGER GENERATION"""DON'T BLAME TODAYS YOUTH WHEN IT'S THE DAMN ADULTS FAULT FOR NOT TEACHING THE YOUNGER GENERATIONS!!!
Thats Loyal things of what he doing,  We need more peoples like him,.. I pray everyday for all of us in world peoples that need stay loyal and respect each other, not criminal or jealous, hate , steal or fight for no reason is such silly things to do out there in world... Sigh pray Jesus for protect all of us in world as well , we are better than that for situation of sociál life out here...  that's nice of her gave him $$ for return purse.. I'm pretty sure there's more loyal peoples will be like her pay whoever return items and reward is nice things for samaritas peoples deserve happy for $$ as gift with return which is good deeds.
Nice!
He’s a good sh&t. Raised right.
HOPE!!!
Eso debemos hacer los latinos. No traficando pendejadas
We need more people like him and no people like Trump. If Trump found that purse he would of immediately spent the money in the lady's wallet
He said it perfectly "If I had my thing lost I would want it returned to me" It's simply the golden rule.
Lol
He is very nice. but it's nothing special in Japan
That woman put a lot of faith opening that door for that dope smoking cookie cutter scumbag
We did some in the 1970 that time it was easy to steal a car so we did and the next day we went to the owner and say we found a car who belong to him and got a few buck for that hahahaha!😆😆
So these women whom obviously have money at least they present themselves that way n they talking oh did you give him $20 😮 are you kidding me that lil clutch purse was at least $500 maybe $400 n then to top off once they realize they look like idiots instead of just saying we took care of him well or something no they start a go fund me so other ppl can spend their hard earned money to tip this kid for doing the right thing and he honestly was just being a good kid smh .. lesson learned is don't marry a women like the ones you help d kid
If you say "there is hope for yhe younger generation" that means you are online too much. There are good and bad people out there regardless of age.
God bless this young man!!!
I'm 64 and seeing a "caring" young person is a wonderful thing!, PLEASE SPREAD!!  GREAT job Son!!
I  have returned wallets several times, and was not offered a dime. Both sets of people are very lovely.
Good man
bro is def the guy that stole that purse
Deport him.
Good man bro.
Raised right ❤ what a good young man. Great job to who raised him :)). Well deserved reward! ❤
Good job mom
🎉🎉
We sincerely have to CONGRATULATIONS  this young honest fellow ! ... 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Nice
You did the right thing😊
Mucho Goodo Adrian.
What a great kid..raised right
Dude stole it n he's mom made him bring it back .dats wat happened 😅.
Didn't bro got sued because they accused him of stealing ?
ALHAMDULILLAH
I hope this young man is living his life with respect & honesty in all areas! He seems to be a beautiful soul...When able to do the right thing when nobody is looking except God, that builds character❤❤
Sometimes the person who do these kind acts don't ask for a reward because they receive it from god..
So glad we still have good people in our generation 👍
Eliana bangin!
I dont know if this is made artificially to make people do this but ill eat this up
NO ONE SHOULD BE REWARDED FOR DOING THE RIGHT THING, THE REWARD IS IN GIVING IT BACK, THAN TO SETUP A GOFUNDME WTF..
I feel that the saddest part about this video is that when I grew up this would have been the norm. Nothing exceptional.
What it looks like to be actually cool.
Thanks for the clear breakdown.
That’s what’s up Adrian! You are what this world needs bro! I don’t know who this dude is, but I am proud as hell of him.
It also speaks a lot about his Mother. He is a good young man.
My man!!!
What a wonderful young man
I found a dude's wallet while I was kiking in the  mountains and his driver's license was in it with his address. I took it to his house and he was like, Man! I lost that wallet six years ago! We both laughed our ass off. It was a great moment.
Mama raised him right!!!
They both tapt it.
He’s so sweet❤
This kid gives me faith in humanity.  Especially with all the entitlement today, honest young men like this don't get enough credit
Jesus is the way the truth and the life
Beautiful job!!!
Someone once hand delivered my lost wallet with my cash in it to my home .. never even saw them. It's an incredible feeling to know some great ppl still exist.
Such a gentleman🥹

Sometimes we judge a book by its cover  and end up missing the best chapters.
The safest bet of all time is that Fox never covered this story.
So this kid actually got sued for $3,000 after this.
Yall can thank his mother
Kid was raised well and has very good morals and values and should be proud of himself, not too many people think like that these days an if they do might not make the same decision because of what's going on in there life whether it be financially or whatever the case, and great that he had really appreciative people like the ones he had
Good Job young Sir keep going the way you are, and the world is there for you. Good job Mom and Dad for teaching him the Golden Rule.
His mama did a good job raising him, good job mama
Boyfriend/Father material! Good job bro!
why is that news?
Good lad🎉🎉🎉
❤
Good young man God Bless him
Both parties did the right thing. Respect all
Probably wasn't anything in the purse worth taking
Solid character.  This kid has a good future.
Don't judge a book by its cover even tho he look like a gang member
That’s rare
Wow 3K reward 😮
Dude was raised proper .
Don’t judge someone by their skin, people look the way they look, and it’s not because they look or are dangerous it’s because it’s they’re style and most of them want to be known as family, thats the way I am too.
The good sinner dirt bag that’s what you say when you are a Good Samaritan haha a dirty sinner
He went all dressed up like a loser ha
this young man is pure stud and looks like a movie star.......respect lil bro
Great honest man ❤️❤️❤️
ngl i woulda stole that shi
They were wealthy. Great
Good parenting
My dad fed the homeless and got cancer, hit by a car, and his dad AKA my grandpa died a painful death 😐 life is great... Isn't it?
That is a good solid up bringing right there!!👊👊 My apluse too the "MOM" and this "YOUNG MAN HIMSELF!!👍👍
Well done Brother!!! 👍 Class is forever!! ❤
Kid made 3000, these guys just upload it to YouTube and make thousands 🤣
Why does he kinda look like Central cee
I woulda taken that shi ion gaf
❤
This is what peak Gen Z looks and acts like 😏😩
Didn't give him anything for returning it lol. The opposite of a good person.
That orange monster deported this woman!  SAD!
Kindness is the real treasure of humanity, be kind Barakallahu Fiikum
Its a different guy than brought it to them originally
what goes around comes around
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Thats so tuff
❤❤❤❤ very good person
I mean he owns that Audi r8
Plot Twist: The Purse had nothing of value in it, So he hit the jackpot with the gofundme lol
Whatever happened to finders keepers losers weepers ???
What a great story!!!
I would do the same, thats just a great young man.
“Even when no one is watching”  32,000,000 people: 👁️ 👄 👁️
☺️🙌
Great on the young guy! Bless his parents and him.
hopefully she let him hit
💫🙌🏻
So nice to see this video so early in the day, this will be in my mind all day. Great job kid!!
adrian
and he's fine
should be the rule. not the exception
And all i get is. A fucken dollar...
Making US PROUD   Adrian!
I did that once when I was younger and all I got was a Hi-5😂
Nothing but God
In a related story his family was arrested by ice and sent to a detention facility and he was arrested on the way to school…. This is what trump america is. Wake up
bro saw it belonged to a thick latina mami , thought he might aswell take his chances.
Raised up right! God bless you all. 🙏
W mans
Too bad most adults aren’t this honest.
😂 the fact that he chooses to dress like a thug too but he’s an upstanding citizen
I was 12  about 30 yrs ago when I found one early morning it had close to 7 hundreds plus very important documents. Took back didn't get anything but I'll do the same today, because God will reward you if it's from the heart.all glory to God.
You will never see that happen again. Plot twist he actually stole it.. 😂
Good young man. 👌👌
20$ is crazy
🫡
So...because you are too weak amd selfish, I will dismiss you.
It's sad that we have to say "there is hope for younger generation". I wish everyone not just younger generation had the basic level of integrity, ethics, and compassion. It feels like the number of such decent human beings keeps decreasing around us.. : (
Superheroes don’t always wear capes
You go dude!!! There is still hope. 🙏🙏🙏
i always like comments with 100k+ likes so if one day i come back to the video without knowing i watched it the comments i liked will be on top because theyre 100k+ like. yapped a lot didnt i
In my country this is standard behavior.
He wanted to holler at that mamacita.
I remember founding on a bus a bunch or original properties registries, probably 30 or 40, I found a phone written over one of them and call. They belonged to a lawyer, I returned them, he wanted to pay me but I refused, I said, if you someone need you, help and you will pay with that action,
Bless his heart. That’s a good kid.
Oh were watching young man...God bless
Should’ve kept the purse because it probably had more then 3k in it
Thank God there is hope in young generation!
That’s amazing! Good job raising this young man!
we know that we are in trouble when something that should be normal turns a big new
we need to be like bro
Love this. Never judge a book by its cover. I walk in my hoodie but always will be nice to people.
Just amazing,  his mom is doing awesome raising him.
Classic case of don't judge a book by it's cover
He sold me fent under a bridge the other day
Awe what a nice story
Back in 2013, I walked for over an hour to this woman's home to return her purse, and the lady just said okay. Didn't even thank me or anything. I can see that God truly loves me. 🙄
Yeah obviously he brought it back, he saw how hot she was on the id. Use your brains people. If it was some dude or an ugly chick they would not be getting that back
I can’t believe we live in a world where kindness is so rare, that returning a purse gets put on inside edition.
„There is hope for our younger generation“ if I knew she said that I would have kept it
At first glance it looked like the title said something e
This is so heartwarming and wholesome ❤
bro was tryna crack that 😂
His parents deserve a prize a well
I did this 4 times in my life. All I got was some chocolates. I appreciated them though. But it's simple. If I lose something I would want it to be returned as well. Which also never happened but cool. 😅
❤❤❤
Is it uncommon in USA for people to make right decisions?
Idiot
People celebrating good Samaritan stories like they’re rare miracles and maybe they are now. But that’s what makes it sad. Good deeds used to be ordinary, now they’re on news, while crimes barely surprise anyone anymore. Being good person used to be the bare minimum
What a great kid
Hope u is thriving to this day!
Imagine the crooked media posting more of this instead..
If that was my son, I would be thrilled.
👍👍👏👏🙏♥️🙏♥️🙏
It sad that people think teens and young people won’t do that!
This kids gonna get mad bit… I mean he will be adored by many young ladies moving forward.
Protect this kid and make sure he gets a scholarship to any school he wants
I returned a cell phone I found and they tried to hold me hostage until the police came.  Never again will I go out of my way hoping people will be grateful.
This young boy is on the path to become a great man! Greatness doesn't come from big speeches, rather from these amazing kind acts!
Ain't that normal...?
Good kid 💯
Even after three years ago, he is still a good son!
Good man, the right thing to do.
🙄
Is this central cee?
so only AFTER raising a lot of attention on social media AND multiple friends wanting to offer a finder's fee he got one and ALSO posing for that on media? thats like filming yourself giving money to the homeless.
bruh
nc
what a guy!
Hey, if you take the time to read, it might open your eyes, if you are willing...    God is real. And he loves you so much! And he is much more real than you know. You are here for a reason.. Just wanna share some truth...  There's just something that the world hates about the truth. It's blinded and the suffering we know today are spiritual issues that we as humans have allowed in, knowingly and unknowingly in our lives, polluting the world.  Because the theme of the world is darkness and self and unbelief. Instead, we must try Jesus..❤the light people claim dont exist. But yet they have so much emptiness and a void they cannot fill, lets be honest dont let pride deny that fact. As a result of that emptiness, they hurt themselves and others and greater than that, they hurt God. Christianity isn't just something that has worked for some. It's not a religion. Its a relationship with God. Not religious talks or deeds, but pure intimacy with our creator. But not everyones eyes are opened to see, and not everyone's ears are opened to hear. Their hearts are hardened to the point they cannot understand Jesus, or believe in him. They find confidence in their earthly wisdom while their pride keeps them from finding the truth. But if we only open our heart to the man we claim isn't alive....  If we only try faith, because that's the only proof we will get. Though we may witness miracles and prophecies come through, we need faith to believe. For it is written, "Hebrews 11:6 NIV [6] And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him."   We must have faith to see God. We must trust in him even if it's faith the size of a mustard seed. Yeah you may look crazy to the world and think it just doesn't make sense. Yeah you may think you might be brainwashed for fall for religious nonsense as the world thinks, but this is the light Because humans were never meant to walk this life alone. And thats why some people are hurting and are suffering and even hurt others, because of the void in them that comes from rejecting the love of God. Because their flesh is subjected to sin, and the principalities and powers of the enemy  they invite into their lives through sin unknowingly brings pain, generational curses, psychological and physical sicknesses, hardening of their hearts, rebellion, and more sin.    But believe it or not. Jesus wants to set us free. ❤He wants a relationship with you. If we could only see how spiritual this world is with the natural mind and eyes, we would be freaked out by the many things we allow to breathe next to us that we cannot see. For example: The spirit of confusion that causes unnatural attractions just like in this video, the spirit of pride, depression, rage, sadness, hate, lust etc. All enemies that keeps us blind to what's really happening.  But Gods mercy is still saying no and it doesnt want to let us go. But time is ticking. Will we open our hearts so Jesus can reveal himself to us. So that we can be saved? But yet we have no excuse, for just the world and all that's in it, and the fact that you wake up, and have breath in your lungs is proof there is a creator.    The enemy blinds the world from the truth. They see the gospel as a cult message, they see the church as brainwashed people. Until Jesus comes back and they realize they have been wrong their entire lives. But I don't wish that for you. God doesn't want that for you. He wants your life. To be prosperous and healthy in him, not in sin. Jesus lived selflessly and died for you so we could be selfless too. But you must open your eyes. Let him help you. And before you think to reply back..just read the verse below and try to understand. Praying for you, for us❤  John 3:16-21 NIV [16] For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. [17] For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. [18] Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. [19] This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. [20] Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. [21] But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God.
This is so wholesome lol
Staged
Well done young man
You know if anybody loses a purse I’m right here
multiple adults stole 3 bags of my family when we were vacationing in london, and then there is this good-willed teenager who did the exact opposite  this world isn't completely lost. this video will be an example for everyone to do and be better
I once found a wallet with over $4000 in it and returned it. She gave me $300 for returning it.   Not sure I would return if it was today😂
Sad when doing the right this is seen as extraordinary . Good lad none the less.
I remember the time i found someones wallet on the ground. I looked at the address on her i.d. and drove to their house. Mind you there was alot of money in it, and cards. And i took NOTHING. I just returned it. Her and her husband came outside. Said his wife lost it at the parking lot. And then guess what.. they didnt even give me a penny... but i did the right thing..😂
Adrian = 🗿
Shoulda let him crack
Zionis hate this good samaritan.
Good job... Honesty is the best policy...  But not everybody believes
Bro gets $3k for being kind but what do we get how is ts fair
I found this dude phone outside.. 'Wife' started calling so I answered and was like 'yo I found your husbands phone, I can meet you somewhere n give it to you..' then she like il call right back... the husband calls and is straight up cussing me out lol like 'why the f i got his sht' he was like 'tell me where you are rn'.... needless to say he never got the phone. Bra was rude as hell
Love this
At first glance, the kid looked like a delinquent. I guess you can't judge a book by it's cover.
This is how our world should be. Teach your children well please people. We the people make our planet what it becomes ❤❤❤
He should’ve gone on a date with em 😂💯
i once returned someone's lost ID found in a Walgreens parking lot and did not even receive a thank you.
Good job and good kid thank you everyone for him doing the right thing and you guys giving him a reward and the publicity of him being a great kid maybe someone needing a very good employee may reach out to this young man because he’s an honest person that was raised right.
The brunette said if you found him i put my Victoria's secret 🙊 😅👻
He wanted to tap that
Wow common sense and common decency is celebrated today!? So sad .
sweet, nice boy 😊❤
What a good young man ❤
good boyy
Wow both of them woman are gorgeous.
Based
This young man returns shopping carts back to where they belong.
This video is way back before the inflation these times people can not!!
I would never
Good energy blessings on blessings 🎉
Sad times when returning a purse gets you into the news, what terrible world are we living in
bro looked like a mexican drug dealer
bro did one simple good deed and was repaid by a thousand folds
I am just like him, just need a lost purse 😊
I’m cringing at the “there is hope for our younger generation.” Stop assuming negatively about a generation younger than you when you were once young. So ignorant
Good Angel
This Gives Me Hope... Good Lad. I know it was a few Years ago.. So.... I hope this Man is OK... His Mom raised Him right.
With all these people supporting him, I believe he will later be rewarded in ways we cannot even imagine now! Beyond money.
Bro going with the high honor run
He was raised right! Good kid!
Million years ago: I was 19 waiting for a bus, I was carrying a lot of stuff, and in a hectic moment, I left my purse at the bus stop. I had no money, no ID, no credit cards. I got home and received a voice mail "hey I think I found your purse" he told me his name and his phone number ... this young man was also a student at my college. I called him and retrieved my purse, all the money was there, of course. Then a couple days later I called the main number for the frat he lived in and asked "Does he like beer? if so what is his favorite beer?" -- "Killian's Red" so I dropped off a case of Killian's at his frat and put a note "good deeds are their own reward, and sometimes you also get beer, thank you!!"
Wow😊
Red more people like this young man with integrity and honesty.
Good story
❤❤ WHAT A GENTLEMAN DID THE RIGHT THING. GREAT PARENTS❤
Great example of dont judge a book bye its cover
He look a like a gangsta but he raised in the right family
The fact that this is newsworthy says a ton about our society
i can tell she could afford that
Solid.
It's sad that a moment like this is so rare that it makes the news headlines these days smh
🙏🏻God Bless this young man.
So cool. WOW that's fantastic! He is an asset to society.
God will bless; favor; and protect that young man for the good he did in returning the purse to the rightful owner. I pray that God blesses this young man with abundant prosperity throughout his lift till the end of his days for the good he does for others. Truly a very honest and respectful young man. Bless him with abundant success in everything he lays his hand to throughout his blessed life.
The obvious thing to do, what he heck are you going to do with someone elses stuff.  I have given back a couple things I found, pepole always rewarded me something, with the exeption of once. I felt good in the end.  People returned some of my things I lost as well so the universe has been good to me.
do US kids normally run around with fully tatted sleves at 17?
😢
"Wasn't me, but we will get the bandit that robbed ya"
Man, that's being a gentleman. That's Integrity. You cannot buy that. Thank you to him, and who raised him.
Very very good
Thank you young man! Respect for you! See what happens to good people!
He's just the sort that donnie trump wants to deport to el-salvadore while he releases his rich child-molester friends from prison. What a country!
Update….This kid is in med school now.
We have hope for humanity! Thank you young man for your good deeds!! 💯🙏
this is the kind of new we need in the world today! Good job, young man and good job to the ladies, and the Inside Edition. Good Reporting!
We need to make good deeds pay more than “keeping the purse”.  And Honestly that’s how you have better outcomes, because he could have kept it and thought my life is better off keeping it…
I bet this guy went home and gave some of the money to his mum
W 17year old
This is a 17 year old grown ass man, how incredibly impressive
Wow, good heart
👌💯👏👏👏
So hope is not all lost yet. Good job kid. Your momma raised you right
Good Lad. He's been raised right.
I’m happy that both parties are so nice and welcome. But at the other hand it’s kinda sad that this is nowadays seen as special, it should be common sense and manners to do this in the first place.
woman is an idiot that should have paid the price for her stupidity but props to this kid
Good citizen.
Its too bad that gofundme didnt make more.
Excellent for his resume if he needs one
I like Marlena's teeth
lol how many of you getting fooled it's unbelievable, these people are well known for doing all sorts of shifty stuff and not just since yesterday 😂
Kid is rewarded and invited to their home. He went back the next day😊
You'll never see a black person do this.
Homey saw her pic and was tryna get some dome
It was nice of him, but it’s kind of sad that this is such a big story. Why are we so surprised when someone does a good deed? Really says a lot about our society.
Good boy  Very nice mate
There's plenty good people in the USA,  president is not one of em
I guess no one noticed the snake on the sidewalk in the first three seconds of this video?!?!?!?!
plot twist: it was their relatives and they trying to scam Gofundme
Good man
Fair pls you do good good good karma comes back
Good for him! I was raised this way as well and now I do my best to instill these types of traits and actions towards my son!
Central ceee
Wow, aren't people doing this all the time these days? I remembered 18 years ago, when I was studying in college, I constantly left my stuff in places, but always got it back. When is returning a purse to the people becoming such a seldom thing?
one time i lost my wallet while downtown in vegas ( i live here) and the person found it and went back to az sent me a letter to my address with his phone number and i contacted him and he sent me the wallet with everything it i had 480$ in there told him to keep a 100$ for his self
Sad thing that an act that should be so normal, is news worthy... Crazy world we are living in.
God bless you brother and mother!
Posted by "Inside Edition" so its fake
Great Stuff Little Brother....
A young man raised right.
What a sweet boy
Steals purse...empty...returns it for reward. Mainstream news to make immigrants look good.
Ur a very good young man.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I wonder how he is doing now. 🙏
Kid sawed women's driving license and was then hoping to get sex...... And maybe copyed keys at lockpick Guys and just checked was addrres right!!! So take your words Back.
he's a hero
Now this is an incredible young man. ❤❤❤
If we have more people like this there would be no need for battle
Lol teens often steal or take all the valuables out of a found purse and then return it to hope for a reward...naive people lol
0:54 adrian
Aww that’s so so sweet
Aww that’s so sweet and I’m so so happy you rewarded him!!!! ❤❤❤
She was hooking up with the kid and paid him off after leaving the purse at their hook up spot....
for sure. fkn ring advertisement
Wow wow wow These are good news. We need them also as the TV news. 😍 there are many good news and good and beautiful people with a good heart out here😍🥰🌟
Those 2 are such  gorgeous women.
Thank you near lord for people like him.
Raised right and did the right thing, too ~ : )
GOD BLESS YOU JESUS LOVES U<333🇻🇦🇻🇦
Good parenting right there!
Blessings all the way around 🎉🎉 Fabulous young man❤❤ May God continue to bless you 🙏 ❤️ 😊
Yep, DO THE RIGHT THING 😂😂😂
I'll freely admit that prior to this, if I saw this kid then I'd cross the road to avoid him. And that's to my shame. Good man.
❤
I am SO glad this kid got a real reward for being am outstanding human being. He will remember and be shaped by this event forever. I hope the universe keeps giving him good Karma ❤
The kid's going places
I think most kids would've done the same, the only reason this was so shocking to many is how he dresses
Jesus is Lord he loves us
"even when no one is watching" - That right there is the best part of it. Kudos to this kid and his mom. I'll bet so many people take one look at the kid and immediately think "oh he probably stole something" or is some "punk kid". No, teenagers are people too. They are just trying to do their best. Some make bad decisions and some don't just like what everyone else does. Give them credit.
Great job sir
I would of told the media that i cannot stand a thief. Thats why i brought it to her. Theives should have a registry like child molesters.
❤
Good parenting.. family life determines community life and thus nation life.. godly homes helps to bring about a good nation.
Quite a contrast from kids who don't have discipline and guidance from loving parents.
He really love and respect his mother, always remember about what she said...
Wow I thought these kind of wonderful people had been phased out. Well done lad 👏
Damn that is a badass  reward lol
We need more kids like this out there in the world !
I feel sad that this video has probably made ten times the money that this kid was awarded
Good man
not only is he a kind-hearted fine young man but he's also a kind-hearted FINE young man.
1. Steal 2. RETURN mORE Money, got it
Lmao I got 3$😂 I didn’t do it for the money so it’s whatever i just think it’s funny
Love and obey God and love each other like God said. It's not rocket science... and it applies to rocket scientists too... it's a sin to kill people.
Good story. We need more of it. It's what. I would do and have done. A guy saw me deipy wallet three month ago and ran after me
The sad part is this young man is few and far between.  Out of 100 kids only 10 would probably return it. Need more people like him.
Shouldn't have shown his face or said his name. Kid looks like he's from the hood. People there know you got that much money; problems on the porch
Kid has a great reference when applying for a job now too.
That kid loves mature women. ❤😋
hear me out on the boy
We all need to be more like this kid man
What a kind and thoughtful guy. 🩵 And I love his name btw.
great story. but its sad this has now become newsworthy. there was a day when this was normal.
Hell yea.
This normal is so alien to America that it's on the news 😂😂😂😂😂
second women is mewing
The Good Samaritan! ❤ The news we all need in this country.
Young,handsome and a heart of gold?
Why can't new channel have this type of content more other than just rage baiting content?
He wasn't even looking for a reward, he just has women in life he cares about and he has empathy! He thought to himself "if this was my mom's bag, what would I want someone to do?" WHAT A GREAT KID!!!!!!😊
An American boy hands on a women's wallet and it's considered a miracle, but in Australia it's a normal daily thing lol
I did something similar. I was in wildwood NJ  at the beach with my wife and kids and I found a ladies purse on the beach and her iPhone.  She had everything in it , social , credit cards etc and her phone. Well I drove from wildwood back to Philadelphia and to the woman’s address on her drivers license.  I did it because it was the right thing to do and because I know what it feels like to lose wallet or the countless times I’ve been robbed.  It would have been nice to get a reward though but didn’t.. I commend the young Man and also commend the  ladies for being super thoughtful for returning the good deed and helping Him out in return.
What a lovely young man, his momma must be very proud ❤
He was gonna keep it till he saw the ID and realized there was a better prize 😂
Asian dude drove 50 miles to return my wallet with credit cards and 400 bucks i lost at a gas station. ❤
THIS IS THE POSITIVE NEWS I WANT TO BE BOMBARED WITH
They've probably lost more purses since.
That’s one fine upstanding young gentleman. I lost my wallet once, it was mailed back to me with everything in it including the cash. Whoever did that, be sure that I am paying it forward.
What a great act of humanity! But could you imagine what would've happened to him had ICE stopped him on the way to this woman's house with her purse???
He’s cute AF!!!!! ❤❤❤
❤
Problem is when a thief is struck by a sudden hint of remorse, and conscience force them to return what they stole, are they still a thief..? I still say yes.
If only we had more people like him and his parent's the world would be a much nicer place. Brilliant that people have shown what he means to them and have rewarded him I applaud all those in this vlog. 🇬🇧
God Bless him
Well done, Adrian. Kudos!
Doing good brings it's own reward. Good lad.
Good kid. His parents definitely raised him right. 🙏🏽
Good honest kid..
Its starts with how they were raised.
Cause he seen how good she looked on the I.D so he had to get with the program 😢
this guy knows what the true punk rock is
They say that no good deed goes unpunished. Well I'd say the story here proves that wrong. 😂
Now people gonna expect a reward for returning lost property.
Should've gave him some 🐈😸😂
Very nice! Boy Hero 😃👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Young man of integrity. Also, Eliana got it going on.

Good man.

Whats amazing to me is that its even news worthy. I mean its nice from the guy but it should always be like this.
His mama needs to know that her hard work paid off!!!!
Good dude! That's how you go places in life.
The kids are alright. It's the adults I worry about.
😊❤
He is lucky they didn’t  accuse him of stealing it
Thats what I would have done! Good job!!
Brown person does something Whites do everyday and it’s national news. Really makes you think.
🥺🥺🥺🥺❤️
Karen it was all staged! For attention! The guy never feceived anything!
i did that to in 2023 i found a iphone 15 pro max when the owner cALLED ME I MET HIM IT WAS his wife phone they gave me 1k
Good parenting.  In 1976 my father found a woman's purse, containing $3500 (Canadian) left in a shopping cart in a grocery store parking lot. He looked around, saw nobody and locked it in his car. He said to Mom, "We'll take it to the police station on our way home."  When they returned to the car, they saw an old lady crying and a cop writing in his notebook. She had taken that money out of the bank for her and her husband to live on in Florida for the winter. Dad walks up to him; "Lost purse? I have it in my car." Cop closes his notebook and says, "Ma'am, you're lucky an honest man found it."  My parents also took in unemployed young men from out of province who came to Toronto looking for work. Mom would do their laundry and cook for them. When she died early from cancer, a number of them came to her funeral and openly wept: "She was like a mother to us when we had nowhere to live."  God bless good parents; we need more of them.
Friend was cute... until she spoke.
Awe he's a good kid! ❤
Dan drony
Same thing happened with my mom..her purse was stolen and 4 hours later, we received a call from a man saying he has a purse with all her documents inside...we agreed to meet at a place and we were surprised to see he was just a teenage boy who just took that random path and saw my mom's purse lying by the pavement..it seems the thief had stolen money and discarded rest of the things at some other place...we tried giving him money but he just kept on saying no... He just touched my mom's feet (blessings in Indian culture) blessings and left...😊 He said this wasn't his usual route but that day he just felt like taking a different route to his home...
I found someone’s check and mailed it to them, they sent me $400 … ❤
His mom did a great job ,thank you mom❤😊
Decent young man 😊.
Her aunt could be the reward
Wonderful young man. Great ladies for raising that for him and bringing awareness that there is still honest young people out there.
Great Job young man! It's rare now a days for people to go out of their way to help others! I'm sure your family is very proud of you as I am.  Many Blessings!
I don't get it, though. Why make a gofund me page and make strangers donate for 'normal' behaviour. Like what did the ad say? Guy does normal thing, give him money?
Like people who steal dogs and return for reward as if they found
Most of us are good people.
great example of a non Fatiguing  action.
Props but he did this for clout, young homie knew this would go viral.
Did they let him hit?
I don't think this feels all that unusual! But a very cool dude and love to see him getting a good reward for going the extra miles, literally!  I wouldn't have taken it to the person's house, I probably would have brought it to lost and found at the store
Good parenting
So shines a good deed in a weary world.
Nah i just hope to get girlfriend.. but it backfire
There is hope for this new generation people 😊
Thats called integrity.  Doing what is right,  even when there is no one to witness it!
What a gem this guy is!
Honestly good ❤
Sweet kid!
They wrong this generation is cooked. He's simply a gem that shines over the rot
You know we living in some crazy times when ppl get rewarded for doing the right thing…
i mean...finders keepers
That young man has more integrity than a lot of people. I know, he did what he did out of the goodness of his heart and did not expect a reward, I'll bet his mother is proud of him
I try to do the right thing! Mainly because of my religious beliefs! Now if you dont believe in God, theres Karma, or Murphys law! Plus, I have helped people and it came back to me when I most needed it!!😊
His mom taught him right and he did her proud!💛  with all the crime today its a beacon of hope that all is not misery dr*gs and deceit.  Bless you lad 💛💛💛💛
So, now we are paying people for being normal?! THIS IS, or MUST BE consider a NORMAL behavior, not GOOD, but normal! But with community packed by phony idiots like you, sure, it's a heroism!  screw ya! Kiddo, don't listen to these stupid women and others, You did nothing special , you are just.a normal, kind person - and it's NORMAL!  Stay NORMAL!
This young man did all the right things, including thinking about the rules of life his mother taught him.   So, why did he take the money.  When you find something that is not yours you simply return it, that is part of being a good human, doing what is right.    The feeling behind returning something lost and knowing that the person is happy, should  be enough for him.  And, this woman should never have offered him any money, and let him know what doing a simple good deed is, without reward.   It is a lesson in life that all humans should experience.   Money is not a replacement of simply doing what is right.   Teach our children better, so they grown up to know better.      Teach an adult better, so they continue to know what is simply the right thing to do, and there should be no other reward.    There is no REWARD needed, expected, given or taken.   Just do what is right, what is the big deal?
God bless that boy
his mother must be soo proud ❤
His got a good mama and papa ❤
A breath of fresh air
Proof that being good rewards us better than being evil.  Romans 12:21: "Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.". This verse encourages believers to respond to evil with acts of kindness and righteousness, rather than allowing evil to defeat them.  Romans 12:20 (NIV): "If your enemies are hungry, feed them. If they are thirsty, give them something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals of shame on their heads," according to the NIV. This verse provides a specific example of how to overcome evil with good, by showing kindness to those who are your enemies.  The passage emphasizes the importance of choosing good over evil and actively working against the effects of evil in the world.  It suggests that good actions, even in response to evil, can have a powerful impact on others, potentially shaming them into changing their ways.  Some Bible commentaries on the verse note that "overcoming evil with good" is a proactive approach to dealing with negativity, rather than a passive acceptance of it.
That young  man was raised right by parent/s that care and he will go far in life. Maybe there are a few of the younger generation left to teach the difference in right and wrong.
great story!
Good for him.
❤
Sounds like u owe him some WAP fr
Goes to show, you can never judge a book by its cover.  But man, now days, strange people who want to do harm, be knocking on people’s doors. Can’t trust nobody now days. Good job tho. I pray God reward this young man for his honesty.
Wow… A great example of all of us Mexicans that were born in the united state and get singled out by ignorant people that assume that we are bad and that we don’t belong here. I’m extremely proud of that gentleman and hopefully they haven’t closed the go fund me yet!
Well done young man, I’m proud of you
Hell of a job young man. Money can come and go but a community like this will provide for you forever.
there r sill good and honest people in the world
Well done, young man. Hopefully, more good karma will come your way soon. And your mom is awesome for raising you up with so much integrity.
Fair Question Me Thinks- GENUINE GREAT KID & PARENTING??? 🙏🏽  Or DID HE DO IT FOR LA RAZA??? 😂
Kid was trying to mac!
Good boy
Good news for once!
More integrity than the current President
Great day great news great people
How cool is this, so nice to see a young person raised right.   Well done young man, well done mom.
the news station should have posted the go fund me info
He is amazing!!! ❤❤❤
Yes ALWAYS do the right thing, even when no one's watching. Amen! You never know when you're entertaining an angel. Treat people like you want to be treated. 🙏🏿🥹💪🏿💯
Almost 4 k! Good deeds always pay off.
How does this make news, i always return wallets and purses.  Cause i know how it feels to have to renew credit/bank cards, license etc
Love this
I found somebody's paycheck and wallet and did the same thing posted up on social media post it where I found it at the bus stop cuz I was riding my bike that day and within. I don't know 11 12 hours I get phone call and they came and picked it up. I didn't get no reward and I don't expect a reward. Never expect a reward by doing something good and just that was somebody 's livelihood their identification everything. I don't expect to get rewarded for things that I should be doing. That's just the way I was raised.
Excellent...!
1:43 fine young man😂😂😂 idk about yall but here in America specifically sand Diego fine young man is practically being called good looking😂
BLess his soul ❤
it's crazy how it's crazy to help now
Damn cuh Issa thug wit a heart 💜
Great kid.
Honest - good - young man!!  Raised well...I've returned debit cards & purses 👛 in shopping carts!! Cause I would want someone to do the same for me!!
It is so heartening to know there are still good young people around.Bless you kid.May you have a good & rewarding life in the future.
🥹🥹🥹❤️❤️❤️His Mom should be very proud. What a great story. Nice young man.👏👏
Usual sus..... Wait.
He already took a picture of all the cards 😂 iykyk
Finally a kid to be proud of. I wish all young people were like him.
I wish i get some money for stuff i have found and returned oh yeah i got 2 bucks for newest iphone i gave back fml
staged
Outstanding young man we need more like him
Nice
I love seeing stories like this. They give me hope that not everyone is dominated by greed. Good for him what an upstanding young man. I wish him the best.
I bet today he would be mistaken by ICE thanks to Trump.
US is so cooked that these simple gestures are news worthy 💀💀💀
That's great. I wish we could have seen him get the reward. That's what I was waiting for. I wish they would do a video of that
Good for him, because I would have just gave it to customer service or a manager and called it a day. 😅
And he looks african american. His ancestors were likely slaves.
He’s gonna steal it but seen that shorty was kinda bad so he thought he would slide and maybe smash
Raised by a real queen
Some one raised a good honest son ain't God good give God thanks and praise amen.
He actually got 23k after the GoFundMe ended.
They are definitely milking this for propaganda purposes.
Sucks we live in a wold where good deeds are so rare that we are greatly rewarded for doing so. Just wish this was the norm. That is one good kid.
1) good for him 2) good job to his mom for raising him right 3) it's a sad commentary on modern society that a simple good deed is so rare and uncommon that people would donate almost $4,000 to reward the kid. In the old days, this would have been just another Monday.
Something like this happened with my passport! It was sent back to me by mail from an institution (I even paid extra for express shipping and tracking/signature upon arrival,etc.), but the delivery person dropped it somewhere else. It showed as delivered but it was no where to be found for two weeks! Canada Post did absolutely nothing when reported to them. I was in the middle of applying for a new passport and had just paid $160 for a replacement when someone had returned my original passport outside my door when I wasn’t home. I tried to find out who it was to thank them, but my neighbour’s camera footage only went back 24 hours 😢
If only there was more people like him
It's not unheard of for someone to steal a purse and then return it for a reward. Yeah the kid is a real hero.
What a good young man.
❤❤
Notice that you never see a bIm do this
He saw how cute she was and was like, I gotta return this lol
He was hoping to get a slice of cougar 😂
Unknowingly dropped my purse at a college party once. The next morning I was frantically trying cancel all my card and get new id’s. Some football players found my wallet, located me through the campus directory, got in contact and returned my purse with 200 bucks in it
and hes fyne shyt
That kid is a bright light in a world of darkness 🥲
Sad that this is news, for something that is the norm elsewhere in the world.
He was hoping to hit be real y’all 😂
Natalie wood look a like
This is a rare thing you wouldn't normally see.a teenager do.a good deed
He did it for the good of it. He didn't expect a reward. The right man found it.  And their friends and family are also such great people to put some money together for him. Just a bunch of good people.
You can thank is mother too for doing a great job bringing her child up to be honest well done mom.
He also wasn't doing a whole " come with me as I return some ladies purse I found" video. Refreshingly honest!❤
I lost my phone on a trip to SF once. It had a sparkly phone cover of BTS. I only cared about the phone cover honestly. 😂 that I still remember till this day.   Then a week later, I get mail. My phone. I almost cried of happiness. Someone found my phone and mailed it to me. I still wonder how they found my address. It was 2015.
I am so happy to hear about someone doing something good!  My prayers and hope for a excellent life are with this young man.
God bless you, Adrian Rodriguez. Good deeds have their rewards, and Adrian Rodriguez's mom is right, you should always do the right thing even when no one's watching.
Plot twist - the ladies keep the money
My husband has found about 5 wallets all with lots of cash in them. As a Jw, we will always choose to return it and the people were so happy. Wanting to reward him but he did not accept the money. Blessings can be paid in other ways too :)
I found a wallet at the airport at the car rental shuttle shelter in a chair. I had a name but no number. I ended calling around to some of the membership  cards she had in her purse and asked them to call her and give her my number. Turns out, the lady was graduating  college from the same school  my sister was graduating  from. We all had flown in for the graduation.   Her husband  came to pick it up from me. When I handed it over without  asking for anything, he looked surprised.
Dang, this AI stuff is getting pretty good
I bet trump supporters want him deported.
❤ what a good young man.
HIS MOM TAUGHT HIM INTEGRITY
I'm surprised those 2 women didn't get you to service the pair of them.
Adrian Rodriguez you’re an outstanding young man and he deserved every penny of that reward
Awesome ‼️
I did that once. And got asked out on a date lol. Would a rather got 3k but I didn’t do it for a reward.
His mother must be the proudest woman on earth
A lot of accolades in the comments but..Yeah I would have given it to Walmart Customer Service lost and found and not helped myself to anything in the purse but that's just how I was raised 🤷‍♂️
What a great guy
God is proud of his deed. He stored up treasure in Heaven upon g doing that. His mother raised him right!
ok but why is he so handsome wtf (no homo fr)
❤❤❤
Great work!!
Finally a good story to report on! God Bless this young man!❤
If it was a white womans purse he would have 100% yoinked it
I did that when I found a wallet on the road side...hardly had any gas in my car, the address was weird, hard to find...eventually, I found the house, my tank now on empty, there was money in the wallet and credit cards. This was in Montecito one of the richest towns ever. I drove up to the brick mansion, and went. to the front door, expecting a big 'thank you" at the very least.....a house keeper answered the door, and then said something to the owner of the wallet who stayed hidden behind the door....and then she turned and just basically grabbed  the wallet without so much of even a kind word, and slammed the door in my face. There's good people in the world and there's bad people in the world. Anyone else probably would have kept the money and left the wallet...I probably won't go out of my way next time for such an ungrateful ending.
Opra. Go away. You are the biggest hypocrite. I wish you would shut up.
It's mind-boggling how in the USA, we live in such an immoral society that when somebody does the most basic of good deeds, we are so shocked that we need to reward them with thousands of dollars and report the deed on mainstream news...  If only Americans knew that there are countries where doing the right thing is just common practice. Someone could forget their purse, wallet, smartphone, etc. in the most public of places, and people who find it will either go out of their way to return it, or they'll leave it where its owner can find it once they return to look for it. No need to give thousands of dollars in reward or make an entire news report about it.
He is THE green flag.
would she have still paid if he was ugly? Probably not 😢
It’s sad that this sort of even becomes news, it should be something that everyone does
Lol Americans celebrating something that's the norm in other countries 😂😂😂
❤❤
Everyone knows who the GOOD folk are and where they live 😅
Adrian deserves every penny ❤
Awesome ❤ AMAZING KID 🇬🇧 😊
Thanks God our country still has some good people!!!
Moments like these make me or whoever wanna cry. 😢.
When I was in the navy, I banked with navy fed. As I was processing out in San Diego, we would go to the bowling alley to eat and drink every night. I would always take cash out because I will run a tab through the roof. I went to the atm inside the bowling alley bar, and when i got my cash and receipt, it said there was $40k more than what I had. I called navyfed and asked one question “is it mine?” And they said yes. I was freaking out! I woke the next morning and started getting paranoid and called navy fed again and asked where it came from. They told me some ladies name that I knew was a complete stranger. I told them to take it out of my account, its not mine. I still to this day wonder what if😂 I know my luck, I would spend the last dollar and get a phone call😂
I remember returning a handbag to an old lady, as I was walking away I couldn't believe I actually did it............I shat in her handbag.....
Hello everyone Jesus loves you very much and may he bring guidance, peace, and joy to your lives ✝️🙏 💖
Recently deported. MAGA.
"two good reason"
He is legend ❤
This is common in Australia.  Its called mutual respect and attracting good karma
Wow he's good-looking and he's got green the purses green that's my favorite color..💚
That's a VERY good image on her doorbell camera. Like exceptionally good. Like incredibly good. Like 'so good that it's fake' good.
If he was fat and ugly, they wouldn't give him nothing.
Good+++❤ well done Son
Why aren't they interviewing the kid?
His Mom must be so proud!!!   Would  want someone like that for my daughter. 😊
Raised a GoFundMe to support someone raised right I love it😅
Integrity.
Respect brother. You restored faith in humanity.
The fact that doing the right human thing constitutes a news segment and has people shocked that he did a good thing says a lot about how horrible our society is. Great parents and a great kid ❤
That's what's up G
Both of them are fine af
I don't think it's something 'special' It's what one supposed to do.
Bet mom and dad were proud that day
Beautiful 😍 ❤there still is good people out there on both sides retuning the purse and rewarding him for his deeds...i love it ❤more humanity is not dead
THAT young man is someone to Cherish. GOOD parents, Honest young man.❤
POSITIVE STEP
He looks like a Filipino. Good job!
I returned a purse to an older lady and got a dollar
There is good ppl in this world  and there still is good he our world good job young man
The problem here is ppl will act like they did the rite thing just to get donations. How do we know this wasn't planned for donations? Ppl says they have cancer and all type of lies to get money now. But i really hope this was genuine.
Californië love Californië love!!! ( dr dre ) fake @ss puppit gangster ( this boy is a great) 🙏🏾🙌🏽 hope for Californië.
Purse probably had 30$ in it, he probably thought I’ll return it and at least get 100$ 😂
I found a dudes wallet laying on the ground one day while i was working, I'm a UPS driver, and there was over $3,000 cash in. I found him on FB and made sure to get it back to him. Dude gave me $300 for doing the right thing
I wish I could "heart" this! Oh my goodness, this is just so cool! Good job!
It’s good hearing about these young bucks doing the right thing….
Rhis guy seen the i.d n wanted to be rewarded with 😺 but it ended working out and fot 3k . Now he can get more 😺 for a month of hk 😺
So not all hispanics are bad hombres 😂😂😂
good for him but it's kind of sad that this is regarded heroic, should be normal
She look like Kim Kardashian off meth.
I love it! Mad respect for this young man!
Wow ❤❤❤
awesome news what a great guy!
Watching this again because there's not enough good news on anymore...
I’m glad to see good deeds getting rewarded instead of punished for a change
That’s my name marquez
I done this before and never accepted any rewards for doing the right thing… but thats just me. Im happy people wanted to reward his honesty and integrity i love that
Good for him, we need more kids like that here in san diego
THIS US THE WORLD I WANNA LIVE IN AMEN ❤THANKS YOU YOUNG MAN YOU GIVE ME HOPE❤💯👍🏾🙌🏾🙏🙏🙏
Its not that crazy its a purse with a phone, wallet, all that i would have done the same. That's too many personal items in one bag.
Bro dressed like Smokey😂
Would of rather got her number then 3k
Earned more than he ever could’ve stolen. Shout out to him
His parent(s) did a good job!❤
Plot twist: he snatched it to begin with
You are a hero sir! ❤
Sad thing is the way he looked people would think he was dangerous and mean but he has a good heart
Integrity 💯
She knew he expected sex in return , so 3k would be a good enough number to get the kid to leave
These are great standards to live by.
F’n EXCELLENT!!!
Don’t judge a book by its cover.
No, no.There There isn't absolutely no hope for the younger generation nowadays.
Name of movie ?
teen boy's parents did good job to taugh him raise and love neightbor Yes i will prayed for him and his family. God be with him and his family all the way. Thank you for bringing up.....i hope all poeples watch this videos and learn how to love neightbors
Already commented on this good job youngester 👍👍👍
Awesome kid. 💙
It's has gotten so bad in America that when someone does something that they are supposed to do (being thoughtful and considerate of others) it makes the news because it is so rare.
They gave his mom a perfect opportunity to say, "See, I told you so." Lol 😉😁🤣😂 Seriously though, what a nice young man. I hope that he continues to be a great person. 👍🏻✌🏻
Dude stole it, saw there was no cash inside. Then returned it for a reward.
You ask why? Evil has no reason, no explanation. Good people always ask why? They want to see the bottom of it. But evil is bottomless.  And children are usually our purest souls❤. So they become victims.  And we are turning a blind eye to all of it! We are so disentisized. Children becoming school shooters . Do we take away the guns? No the solution is metal detectors and arming the teachers. ppoffftt There must be 1000 channels on youtube alone.  All about serial killers, child killers, family enialaters. And thats not counting cable tv😢 Because cable is monitored. Youtube just makes you say SA instead of rape or sexual assault. Yet no laws are changed or sentences increased. Being convicted of those crimes gets you parole. Sometimes they get out and re-offend immediately just to redo all over again. But society kinda says women and children are disposable😢
There is no “hope for our younger generation” if this act of kindness happens so rarely that it gets taken up on news. Literally everybody from my country knows to return purses to the people who lost them.
Don't judge a book by its cover. The kid looks like a thug but he acted in righteousness of heart.
These women were hoping this “young man” would come in and show them something lol 😂
Good job young man.
Bless him, oh, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob....and His bless these eomen and all who contributed to the reward. ❤❤❤
I did this once found a wallet while jogging saw the address on the ID took it to the house, they were home making noise inside but didn’t want to open the door so I just left the wallet. I’m glad he got at least a thank you and then more.
Awesome!!
Much 🤎 and BLESSINGS to him
Damn good kid.  It used to be most people were like that.   👍
Why they didn't go find andvinterview the young brother to praise him?? Good people stillbdo exist
LOVE LOVE LOVE every person in this story!
What a honest sweet ..love& light peace
There needs to be a story made of this incident, with Jeremy Irons narrating.
🙏
There never was a time when there wasnt hope for the younger generations. The kids have always been good.
Good human
Great young man
I did this one time I was on my first date with a girl in the mall and we went down to the food court and the table I picked on the ground was a purse. we both noticed it at the same time and I picked it up and opened it and there was at LEAST 1000 dollars cash in it which at that time in my life was the most money I had ever seen and instantly the second I laid eyes on it I said the f word super loud cuz I knew I couldn’t take it. It would be too much for someone to lose too much for myself to lose if it were reversed so I turned it in to the security. All on camera.
This is the highest level of honesty.
Why is this so shocking 😂😂😂it’s common sense
He is brought up with respect
He deserves a good massage from this two nice ladies 🤣🤣
More young people need to follow in his footsteps. What a great kid!! Glad he got the reward!
I hope people can grow and learn to not judge others based on their appearance but their actions. This kids kindness is infinitely more important than how he wears his pants. Im glad he's choosing to be the best person he can be and the ladies recognized and rewarded him for his good work.
Why so few views?
Lol. This drips fake.
I bet this kid get a lot of respect as he walks outside, he got mine for sure
Good man
great job young man you are amazing
Bravo l'ami.  ❤️❤️❤️
What a great Young Man I would hire him on the spot without experience
Imagine this Kid checked the Bag first and was like „aint worthy lets bring it back“😂😂😂😂😂😂 nobody would answer this & its a joke
🎉🎉🎉
Way to go young man
Imagine if contents were already missing prior to his intervention, unbeknownst to him. Bye bye 3 grand 😅
It's said that it's not a norm but a big event, and a wow.
That's cool 😎🆒❤
I was born in san diego no wonder why i was raised right 😭
this is the bare minimum. this should be the bare minimum
Can only hope to be like this young boy here, not for reward but to put that positivity and feeling of "maybe the world aint that bad" vibe that some of us would like to feel.
As a dad, I'm proud of him on behalf of all dads.
Lmao just seeing those 2 latinas would be the reward for me 😍
Feels like its set up
Great parenting parents!!
God bless you🙏 you’re a good kid, I bet your parents are proud😊❤️
Good job young man ❤
That's nice 😊
This young man was RAISED RIGHT! Props to his parents!! Good job 👍🏼
Tim Dillon is right about feel good stories. This is the opposite of a feel good story, if you need to bring something so basic to attention as some sort of faith in humanity restored then things must be really bleak
People who have morals physically can not do wrong. It’s like betraying your own self by stooping low enough to do anything immoral. Treat everybody how you would want to be treated..
Good Job Dude
I've returned one wallet and one purse. (everything intact) the first time, I got 50 bucks. The second time, I got 250 bucks. AND I can live my life knowing that I did the right thing.
Thank you Adrian
Thank you Adrian

Tegrity
What a good guy!!!
This just restored my faith in humanity after falling into a rabbit hole of true crime videos
Good parenting
31 million people watched this king do the right thing
What a good kid. God bless his heart❤
I really think a really deep hug would have made him feel really really good. I don’t think he asked for anything
salutes not only to this kid but this kids parents for doing a great job in raising him, good stuff
Nothing like a boy that knows the value and wisdom of a God fearing mamma!  He is blessed! ❤❤❤
i once found a wallet with $320 inside. i also returned it and the owner was glad to have his wallet and $50 back.   a good day indeed!
Very good video, and story!
no their is NO HOPE for this generation 🤷‍♂️🤦🤣
Dam, he got over 5k i think. Buy another car, vato.. Celebrate well.  No drugs..
My God she has a lot of work on her face
As a 66-year-old man I believe the vast majority of young people are good like this young man. Unfortunately, heartwarming stories like this do not get the attention it deserves.  I may not agree with a lot of young people's taste in dress or music I have faith in the younger generation.  I feel this fine young man is a shining example.
Would have been funny af If he gave them back a fake version of the purse
Wonderful young man, & the young women were raised right too! 🙂
Wow no vocabulary making my race  look bad speak clearly if don't open your mouth my dogs speak better than you
What a good young man!
My goodness there.are dtii good people theres hope for the world
One time I dropped my wallet somewhere and I found it in my mailbox one morning and I was like hell yeah I still don’t know who found it
All actions have consequences, be they bad or, in this case, good. Well done, young man! Your parents should be proud.
This also speaks a lot about you guys and this is wonderful you have huge hearts and I'm so happy that you got your purse back and that you guys I wanted to do something special for him. That takes a special person so you all are incredible
bro should have stolen it😓😓
Esta acción  mecere ser reconocida ya no hay jovenes con valores sociales lo felicito ❤❤❤
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
It also says a lot zbout US society. That this makes the news....
one time, like few years ago, at the age of 9, i was driving with the bike and a found a purse in the middle of the street, i gave it to the nighbours becaue they know them, and on the next day, i got a merci chocolate like as a pack
A brilliant and well raised young guy. You’re a great kid, Adrian.  We need more terrific people like you. A well deserved reward too.  Awesome 🤩 😊👍💖
Good man.
One decent black out of 43.1 million in America. Nice.
Parents should be very proud.
Props to the parents that knows how raise a kid 👏 mexican family off course
If this happened to me I'd be like "we are friends for life, joined by fate. You will come to our family dinners now"
It's sad that this is regarded as exceptional behaviour.
I have a boy in my 4th grade class named Adrien but his last named is Adrien White.
He thought it was a good way to meet a beautiful lady and start a relationship as soon as he looked at her license picture 😂 he was right....that lady was incredibly gorgeous 😍🥰❤
Parenting done right, great job young man in doing the right thing.
Du you know what I just feel a hell of a lot better!
The purse is worth more
Good dude. There are good people in the world. Sadly there are more people who just pretend to be.
I can only hope my son becomes this type of person
God Bless...
This would be a non story in the US a few decades ago. Good on him tho
We would have deported him.  MAGA IS ALWAYS RIGHT
Ohhh please
Thanks, Adrian!
Not all Hispanics are bad , the majority of Hispanics are good hard honest working people .
Staged
he probably stole it first ;) ....
I mean this should be normal and it shouldn't be anything special
This is what integrity looks like.
What she say,lol
Bogus story
champ
I love when we reward generosity higher than crime!
God bless his Loving Mum for instilling wisdom and naturing his Loving Son the right way. God bless this young gentleman and he deserved the blessing. Whatever seeds we all plant in others will surely manifest in due time.
Good for you Adrian .
nothing special
Honesty is the best policy, this would NEVER happen from a liberal or democrat
i actually came to hear the good news. in this world, we need more true acts of kindness, because it becomes a ripple effect of positivity. 🎉
Nice story.  The dark haired woman who lost the purse is a moron.  How dare you do not offer to reward a person in this position.  You INSIST they take the money.  She wanted no part of that until it was other peoples money and she could get a spot going viral and local news.  Shameful
Here in Denmark it’s common sense but in USA it’s a sensational 😂
he just wanted to smash
I like everyone in this video ☺️
They could have offered him a three way on top
Adrian Rodriguez is a great man. If you see this, Adrian, I salute you!
God bless this young man.
Treat others the way you want to be treated.
Integrity
Great thing you did Mr Rodriguez I salute you 🫡
What a dummy !! Sigh 🤦‍♂️
Bless.
Wonderful young man.
Good kid
They made a gofundme for him? How embarrassing. Give him some of what you got. Don't beg others to do that.
Young man, your mom raised you RIGHT... I know she is very proud of you as the rest of us who have seen this video. I pray the Lord bless you with a bright future including your mom who taught you right from wrong. Seek the Lord, he will guide your paths and watch over you... He is the Way. Amen
He should ajve gyot qunties number cuz damn!
Don’t believe any of this. This is a go fund me scam. 0:12 these people laugh at us. They come here and think we are suckers. And we are cuz they steal and lie to us
Bravo my dude!
Awesome! A young man with integrity!!! You bring me joy😊
He low key thought he might get a “thank you”. Bet her picture looked good
Bravo
bro got a nice reward
Bravo beautiful young man!!!❤
Imagine if it was a black kid. purse gone, money gone lmao
Pretty sad that this makes the news
Always knew that Timothee Chalamet is a good kid after all.
Mamma raised him right ❤
Central Cee in his spare time
hes one of the good ones, most people his age are cheeky brócoli heads with no future 😮
Fair play mate great parenting 👍🏻❤️
Its was all part of bros plan🤣 bihh prolly only had 50 bucks in there
This happened to me back in Danville Illinois. I left my purse in the shopping cart and someone turned it in to customer service. I just got paid. My cash was still in there. Thank you God. I’ve turned in many wallets and purses in my lifetime. Good definitely will come back.
I would have taken the Money in the purse and filled my car up with the Credit Cards
Na thumb eu pensava que era o Raphinha do Barça
There is a Song about this Guy. It is called: One in a million...😂
3k?! Wtf
You can be raised right and still do wrong.. that kid has a good heart and soul
I want to know if she still thinks theres hope for the younger generation because now she has to see there isn't maybe 1% is going to turn out good
I was in my early 20s almost in my mind 20s i was working at a hospital as a transporter one weekend i found a wallet i told the front desk lady and call the security and he told me that a patient lost it since Friday i think it was on Sunday that i found it the wallet had money over $550 and the guy came on Monday to pick it up and wanted to reward me $50 bill but we can't take the money and the hospital took a picture with the boss of the security and posted on a wall doctor's, nurses and other staff was saying congrats.
Its alright. He photographed all the cards first. 😅
This is al scripted
❤❤❤❤❤
Cute🥺🥺
I once saw some schoolkids throw a purse into a trashbin in a parking garage and run away. I was around 24 at that time. I retrieved the purse and figured out where the owner lived. It was a schoolteacher (because of the books inside). Brought the purse back to the house and all I got was a nasty look, like I was the one that stole it. I barely got a thank you.
Imagine a world when returning lost items is world wide news
I wonder why don't this guys become the politicians or those leaders who would be very helpful for our society
Weird porn intro,  Probably he is few of his generation
Your mom's advise "Always do the right thing" and doing it will be your guardian angel and path to a good life. Your fortunate to have a Mom that loves you so much. I tell my teenage grandkids if you wouldn't do something in front of me, don't do it.
Y’all tripping he went there cuz he seen shordys pic on her id and was hoping to hit 😂😂😂😂 I would’ve done the same thing
Blessings come more than a dozen.  I am Very Proud of U Man💯
Nice young man, good to see him celebrated for his kindness.❤
They got scammed
Parenting, that’s where everything starts. Good work young man. Thank you for listening.
Girls get him.
hi i u h o
👍👍👍 💯💯 good job bro
Where are the negative thug comments????
You are an awesome young man Adrian Rodriguez.  Your mother taught you the definition of integrity.  Doing the right thing even when no one is watching.  We are all very proud of you.
What a great young man!! Respected the situation, polite, honest and humble. My wishes for Adrian Rodriquez is the very best in life!! Hope he is doing well!❤
LETS GOOO
Returned a purse to two baddies n got 3k big Ws for bro
It’s called living by the golden rule
He saw her photo on her license and thought he could get a different kind of reward. 😉
You know his mom is probably so proud of him right now. Seeing him do such a good deed.
What a awesome young man 👍
Fineshyt😻
Ohhhh he fine😻
Good Humans :) couldnt be more proud of my countrymen!!
This looks like straight out of gta
Good for him. Respect
This is nice to see, some people still being raised correctly
He wanted some poon let’s be real
Only because it was a woman. Gooner
Here’s hoping he put 10K in his pocket
Oh how proud he must have made his mum. x
Bruh, he stole it.
That lady’s surgeon ruined her 😭
Someone did this for my daughter. They were leaving the state to return home, but they did a U-turn and drove out of their way. Her credit cards, social security cards, everything was there, including her child's stuff. This was Atlanta, Georgia andvwas a black family, so before you judge ppl by race, remember every race has its good and bad
Now he can buy some pants that fit. God is good. 🙏🏻
Looks setup
Congrats to the great parents.  Hopefully some young parents will follow their lead and teach their children to do the right thing
That well raised , honest young man gives us all hope for the future. The young of today are the parents of tomorrow. the world needs more like him.
❤
Yes that man is kind but why did he pull his pants… weird
What everyone else has said, x 1,000,000,000 ❤❤❤
It’s a shame that modern society has degenerated to such low standards that honesty is regarded as something extraordinary.
When children are raised properly, they grow into genuinely good human beings in adulthood. Parents must teach their children to love their neighbors, even if they are not living nearby. Acts of kindness are what define true human beings who care for each other in society. It's better to live to be a good human being than to live a terrible life full of drugs and crimes.
The boy has ‘tegridy
Nothing worth stealing in the purse. Might as wel bring it back to look good and mabye get a reward. If the purse had $100 in it this would not happen.
HERO California Teen
I returned one to am Asian once in 1986z. He just took the wallet full of money not even said thanks. Never returned a wallet ever again.
future
Wtf😭
love feel good stories like this.
I love this kid.
Doing the right thing will ALWAYS bring you GOOD karma. Good job young man and great job Mama for teaching her son integrity. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 🥰
He makes (brown people) like white people call us, look good. See not all brown people are monsters. Just kind, human and respectful. Good for you son!
Two great families right there ❤
Plastic surgeri money?
🙄
Yes! There is a saying my Dad used to tell us since we were very young! He always said that "True 'integrity' can best be proven when you 'pay it forward' without getting 'caught'!" 😊 My 2 sisters and I loved that and I raised my two children with that as one of my most  important lessons on life. He is gone now but I am so grateful for the values and morals as well as the great role model of how a parent should be he instilled in us kids. He was a kind, generous and fair man who loved "showing" us not just "telling" us about right and wrong and how to make each day a discovery and adventure! My Dad was my hero and a one of a kind huge-hearted human being! I really miss ya Daddy! Even in my 60's I will always be a "daddy's-girl" 😊❤😮
He has integrity! Great raising, MOM! ❤❤
22yrsold white boy Iam watching
Dont always judge a book by its cover!
❤
We need more kids like this who were raised the right way. To have respect and honor.  A lot of people lack those things.  Good for this young man to do the right thing. And hats off to his parents for raising him right
Well done lad hope u have spent ure reward very well.
Mom❤
This young man was well raised.
jom kawen adik 17 tahun ..awk mmg seorg lelaki yg baik budi pekerti
Wow they made him a GoFundMe account that is freaking pathetic
❤
Good deed but how did the woman not realize that she left her purse after unloading her groceries? It’s a decently sized purse. And wouldn’t she be panicking and try to find it?
Fake
Never do the right thing for a selfish reason. Never expect tp be rewarded. Life will reward you...
Why is this so big for y’all. I would do the same…
Yesss
I love it
Great man. He deserved that reward.
Why do we as race even have to ask "What was the reason you returned it?" It should just be a common thing no matter what
He was raised right
Model citizen🪽
It all starts with the family!
👍👍👍
I own a Classic Car dealership and 7 years ago I caught a 15 year old kid breaking into one of my parts sheds intending on stealing some parts, He said he was only doing it to be able to buy food for him and brother, their father was in prison and their mom was strung out on drugs and didn;t care about anything else. I called the police but the reason I did was because I had a plan. When the cops got there I had  the kid sitting inside the shop and I told the police officer the deal and that I didn't call to have him arrested, I wanted his help to help the kids. He called CPS and we all came up with a plan, they went and got the younger brother that was 11 at time, and they left the boys with me temporarily until they could get something on paper. I ended becoming their foster dad, Andre just finished his 1st enlistment in the Air Force and going to college under the "Stripes to Bars Program" Deshuan is going in the Air Force as soon as he graduates in couple weeks.
I wonder what his parents think about this they must be proud
We just gonna ignore the fact this lady left her purse, with all her belonging, in a grocery cart..... what are you doing lady.... on your phone?? pay attention...
I did this few years back found a wallet at 10 pm looked at the name and address seen it was a dude who looked my age and lived close by so I drove to the house and knocked on the door and some woman asked who I was and what I was there for …”I found a wallet at the pizza store parking lot and it has this address on it “..she says “ok can you hold on a sec I’m gonna go get my husband he’s asleep “ five ten mins goes by still waiting then all of a sudden a see a cop car pull up with no lights or nothing just a normal check single cruiser …cops gets out and says we’ve had a call about a stolen wallet do you kno anything about that and as he says that the homeowner comes out …the woman not the husband …and she starts telling the cop this guy stole my husbands wallet! Turns out hubby was at work working nights and she assumed I was lying and using his wallet as like a way get into her house or something lol …she called the husband at work finally getting ahold of him at work and he says …honey before you say anything I need you to go over to the pizza store and try and find my Wallet I stopped there before work and musta fell out there …both me and the cop looked at her in so must shame ….:she didn’t even apologize..I went out of my way to do a good deed and that happened

Funny cuz where I’m from u try and do the right thing like this young gentleman and you’ll either get the cops called on you or they will straight up ignore you knocking u try and do the right thing but people act hella weird
He’s so fine😫
Sheesh I would return the bag also if I saw who it belonged too🤣
This is the kind of stuff that should be covered in media.  Such a good kid!
I hope he got his gofund me reward❤❤
Good man!! We need more news like this
The dream kid to every parent
Moral of the story, never judge a book by its cover.
And he didn’t even step on the snake.
I've got to say this young man is amazing God bless him and his mother because she taught him right and he listened you know he's going to be going far in life with that attitude.
god bless you young man
The way he is dressed, he looks like someone who would steal a purse, not return one. Goes to show, you can't always judge a book by it's cover.
So many dummies on social media. This was a ruse. They all got a pay day and fame. Smh 😂
I hope things go well for him in life.
That’s a good dude. if everybody was raised that way, and did the right thing criminal attorneys will be out of business
nah bro saw the id pic and wanted to hit it 🤣🤣
That’s what I’m talkin about
❤❤❤❤❤
But they raised a fund here right? I mean it’s ppl’s money not they had given from their pocket
Good for him. Says a lot about his character
these people never speak english yet they are all rich. this country is a joke
Bro's aura +100,000 pts
What a beautiful story! More good news please 🌸
I think he stole it first.
So did he actually get that GoFundMe or was it yet another scam?
Imagine he was the one who stold  and gave it to them back and got  free money lol
😭
Someone show this to Donald trump
🙏🙌
I need to see stuff like this because loooord this world is crazy. I need to be reminded there are still good people.
I’m the same way!! And my purse has been returned many times
This is nice
❤❤❤❤
I found a neighbor's ID card and got accused of stealing it when I gave it to them.
That is so cute . God bless. :-* 💜 smile❤ 💕  ❤️😊❤️😊 So cool . Heart 😊❤️
Yeees. So amazing. Im inove . I live it. Yhe world is good. The world is good. Thank God. :-*
WONDERFUL STORY.❤❤
What a g
Awe ❤
Good on you young man.
That good feeling he got returning it far outweighed whatever money was in there.
Many years ago, I worked for a landscaping company and we were trimming shrubs at a Denny's restaurant off the interstate. I was 17. I found a purse in the bushes. It had been there for a very long time and it was full of stuff. No cash, but credit cards, bills, makeup, ID, photos of family.  She lived in a different state. I took it home and proceeded to call every number in her address book or on a bill to try and find her. (This was before computers.) I finally reached her old landlord who had her call me. She was an older Hispanic lady and she couldn't believe that I had gone thru all that trouble. She explained, in broken English that 5 years ago, she and family were eating at the restaurant, she went to the ladies room,  left her purse in the seat and never saw it again. She gave me a forwarding address and I mailed it back to her. I felt so good to do that deed.
What A Young Man Of Integrity! May God Continue To Bless This Young King 💗
Great young man may God keep blessing you for you're good deeds.
Beautiful.
I think it speaks a lot about our society that we are so shocked when someone does something good.
Time to go find some lost purses.
Adrian Rodriguez you are a truly inspiring young man who has the heart of a golden child! What a blessing you have over you! God is with you and working through you and your beloved family!  WE THE PEOPLE SEE YOU AND ARE HUMBLED BY YOU. MAY GOD BLESS YOU AND ANNOINT YOU WITH A BEAUTIFUL LIFE! UK
and he looked like a wannabe gangster
Up standing young man i hope they raised alot of money for him.
Someone who has read the tilte🙈🙈🙈
He’s fine and he has a good personality 😅😅
what a beautiful young man! you will go far in life
Well done young man
❤❤❤
Great job to his mom for raising him right
Heart lifting!❤
Awesome job to the mom/dad and to this young man! God bless!
Much deserved but 3k😂 wow
He is simply not broke in despair and hungry, a person who would’ve taken the purse would not necessarily be a bad person and a person who returns a person is not automatically a good person
This boy only a hood in name, an angel in heart
He will be doing the right thing for the rest of his life ❤
Good kid
B
What goes around, comes back around
Just shows how doing the right thing can go along way….
Good kid :) awesome😊❤
Salute.
He must’ve not trusted the store employees to do the right thing. Because why would he not just turn it in to them when he found it in the cart?
❤❤❤
prolly stole it and returned it for the reward
I remember I found a guys wallet had £160 in it, rewarded me a fiver this guy gets nearly 4k what a joke lol
He seen how bad she was on that ID
If you don’t keep cash in your purse you may get lucky
once I found a fat wallet in a trade show, i returned it to lost n found, gave 'em my business card, and lo n behold they never even say thanks. NEXT TIME IMMA KEEP IT!!!
His mom raised him right.
W man 🙇🏻‍♂️
Btw this kid ended up getting arrested a year later in connection with a schmurder.
I’ve had YouTube try to recommend this video to me a thousand times. Crazy how the algorithm works so hard so you’ll see this act of kindness and the Alphabet corporation hopes you’ll forget all the crime in this country caused by (you know what kind of elements). This is fuel for the midwits to have false hope and false confidence in an obviously declining society.
The Force is strong with this one. Long life to you pray 🙏 🤲
My mum left her handbag in the taxi. She had lots of cash and jewellery. The taxi man delivered the bag to the police station, and Mum was able to get it. She rewarded him handsomely. Good people are far more than the bad ones, but they don't always make the news.
❤
He stole it and returned it and got paid lmao genius
wow way to look like a total prejudiced person in one sentence
This guy is said to be Vincent
Now this gtuves me hope to the new generation where I belong ❤🙏🩷
I once found a wallet on the side of the road outside of a Walmart. After some Facebook searching, I was able to contact the owner. She hadn't yet realized her wallet was missing. I returned her wallet with everything inside, debit card, government benefits card, and her crisp $100 bill. She didn't even check inside to see if I had stolen anything. She just thanked me and handed me a $20 bill. I declined the money at first, but she insisted. She had a new born in her arms. I'm sure it would have bene a tough day for her to lose that wallet. I always smile when I think about walking up and returning it.
Adrian... making the USA great with small good deeds!!
Good job buddy 👍
He's a wonderful example of Respect an good Charecter and thoughtfulness.  A great young man taught well ❤ very proud of him as a human being an a mom also . I taught my son and daughter as well . God an Jesus are watching And also there's  Karma which is very real as well an it pays you back ! God bless him an family 😊
24 years ago I found a purse, I opened it up and saw the cash and sadly I kept it. I still feel guilty to this day. I was 13 years old at the time.
People always expect a prize for helping someone.
Always do the right thing. Yall, stop acting this religion doesnt promote this already. God is good ❤
Very nice guy!
That is normal buisness in the Netherlands
That shows great character! Well done to the young man!
I mean, they could have done a shower scene.
This must be suprising out west or in the big cities. Pretty normal in rural America.
remeber when returning lost stuff was not "heroic"? wtf
That’s awesome on all counts.
This is awesome 👏
Imagine being on an article captioned “Young man raised right by his parents” is mad rizz ❤🎉
The boy will be a great man. Kudos to him and the ladies for raising $$ for him
God bless him ❤
Faith in humanity restored
Cheers to mama for raising her boy right.
I found a phone in manhattan inside a cab! I told her I would meet her at an Apple Store because my friend was buying a phone and she gave me attitude and did not even thank me.
What an amazing young man!! His mom raised him well and what a blessing he is to society. So encouraging to hear this story!! ❤
Few years back i saw a guys wallet drop out of his back pocket in the middle of a busy street in town at Christmas time. I shouted to the guy, and ran over (with my kids) before someone picked it up, and I grabbed it and handed it to the guy. It was absolutely STUFFED with notes. He must have been doing his Christmas shopping in cash...  Anyways, he thanked me and gave me £100, which I gave to my girls.
This is what Good Karma means
I bet he is going to have lots and lots of girls wanting to go out on a date with him now 😂 he will wake up in the morning seeing them standing in line at his house 🏡 😂😂😂😂😂 and say what the.....H - - - !!!!!
imagine this becoming a news story. the US is cooked
What a gentleman! He didn't record himself while bringing the purse, meaning he really just did it to be kind to others and his mom raised him wel <33  I hope society will learn from this gentleman and will be like him too!
I lost a hoodie that was valuable too me and never found it again after I dropped it somewhere
Amazing integrity
A good story
Humanity still has children who give us hope, don't judge a book by its cover
There's 0 hope for the younger generation but nice try 😂😂😂
Worth showing our kids such videos . Great kid and this kid is raised very well 🙏
I think the: “Even when no one is watching” is so important in this scenario. I see so many videos on Youtube where people film themselves doing good deeds, it becomes hard to appreciate when some (not all, but it’s difficult to figure out sometimes) are not genuine and just done to generate views. This video was a breath of fresh air and I hope this young man received all the money that was donated on that GoFundMe.
You shouldn't be rewarded for not stealing.
The praise and respect this young man has earned is worth 1000x whatever was in the purse.
That kid has great parents
And this is why the world needs good parents, great job mom and great job son 👏
Respect Sir from the North of Scotland, you are a fine human.
👏👏👏wow
If this is the same guy he was arrested one year later in connection for homicide.
It all sounds great! But life is strange... I once spotted a, womans wallet. In the center of the road, where some plowed snow, and ice was melting away... I turned around, and retrieved it. It was full of stuff. I went home and  looked through it, for a number to call. There was a liscence, with a 16 year old owner, inside it. I found a number on something, and called it. The people, that answered were her parents. I told them the story, and they asked me if my intentions were just to meet the young girl? Then the mother said, I guess it was empty! I said nothing, I was speechless. I gave them my address, and stated that I really could understand, their concearn for her, and 2:05 2:05  agreed to return the wallet. When they arrived, the "mother" only rolled down the truck window, partway. I handed it to her and said, You were wrong... it wasnt empty... there was $125.00 dollars in it... which I left inside it, just where it was! As I handed it through the window slot, she snatched it, and closed the window, as they drove away...  No, thank you, not even a word... Being nice is its own reward, God and Karma, is my reason to keep being nice! If it doesnt have 4 legs... DONT YOU TRUST IT! 😉
He didnt do it to be nice. Just did it because the girl in the driver's license was dine af! And he wanted some of her😂
That’s a good mom teaching her son to be a upstanding human being !!
Wow this is a wonderful  story
There's still hope for the California people!
in germany right after giving back the purse, he would get sued for stealing (even if all the money is still in there)
In prison for murder now is crazy
We’re not all bad
Most people don't understand that any other choice than doing the right thing will ruin your self image, self trust, trust in others, hope, happiness and self love. Doing the right thing is the best thing you can do not only for others, but also for yourself.  Denmark is typically considered the happiest country in the world, and one of the surprising reasons is that they pay horrendous taxes, but they interpret it as taking care for others and the community. They even leave their babies outside in the stroller when they go to restaurants. They know people are trustworthy and caring.   Trust makes us happy.
Isn't it protocol to give it to the police.....?
Great kiddo.. god bless you sir ... Your mama taught you right 😀
A very noble deed by him for sure. Very recently an older couple used a self checkout at Walmart before me. When they left after about 30 seconds I noticed that they had left a bag of items and a bank envelope of money sitting there. I quickly chased them down to give them the money and bag of items. They were surprised that they left the stuff and were appreciative to get it back. I've never seen anyone leave their purse behind someplace though. It's always important to treat others the way I would want to be treated. If I left anything behind by mistake I would hope that someone would try to give it back to me.
Then he ended up smashing one of them 😂 hahaha
👏
Nice 👍
Cant be real $3000 omg
Nice gesture, and amply rewarded
Stand up kid right there thank god there’s still  some around !!!
❤ I love this.
🙏 love these good stories
Good Dude!!
Why is this news - poor kid didn't consent to being recorded.
Bro ran into so cougars
A LOT of these positive videos, need to reach a certain someone, hell-bent on deportation 👍🏾
Praises to his mothers' lessons👏🏾
Thanks kid. You've restored my faith in humanity. ❤
Way to go young man. Your Momma must be so proud!
That’s awesome 👏🏾
Outstanding young man!
He probably has wonderful parents, Didn't teach him how to talk nasty to people, Do nasty things to people, Im proud of him.
I’m looking at some comments from Republicans and they’re just judging him saying like oh he just saw her ID picture and went right away? That’s when Man it’s blessed that he found it in a shopping cart and took it to her with everything inside of it. You guys think it’s just because of a picture. He looks so young. She looks older. Republicans just stop judging the race. How will you  Feel like if you lost your wallet and a Mexican went  go return everything to you fully you could be either a woman or a  man
If only the newer generation was this kind and selfless.
This is refreshing, I left my bag in a Uber and I had to reason with the Uber driver to get my purse back lol only when I told him my dad was a sheriff he dropped it off at my house
And he fine too 😂❤
What a shambles.. she hasn’t changed her address, left her purse in a trolley and thinks 3 grand is a suitable amount to give… wtf
It’s crazy that here in America this is an awesome story because this great kid did something that probably 95% of the younger population wouldn’t have, yet there are many countries where this would be completely normal and not surprising at all. I left a nrand new $700.00 car stereo on a bus in Japan, and when I realized it about 20 minutes later I knew it was long gone but something told me to walk back to the bus stop anyway. Maybe 5 minutes later the same bus I was on pulled up. The driver had got to the end of his route, walked through the bus, found my bag with the stereo, and drove his empty bus back past his previous stops just to possibly find the giant white kid who left something on his bus. I was blown away.
WHAT A KIND TEENAGER RETURNING A PURSE I WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME THING AS YOU HONESTLY IS THE BEST POLICY AND HONESTLY ALWAYS PAYS OFF YOUR A COOL TEENAGER YOUR MOM TAUGHT YOU WELL.
Wow this things arent normal in usa, in Portugal its quite common.
lets be real, he saw the face of the ID and thought he was gonna get lucky that night LOL
Ladies would you do the same or rock your new bag ?
This kid was raised right. Give credit to his mom who raised him😊
Good job to his parents 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
role model teen, hes rasied well
Good person!
I did this with a wallet fall of cash and got nothing in return... But then I didn't do it for a reward.
Awesome ❣️  thanks young man
Wow, expectations are so low now. This should be the norm, not something rare or unique.
Its a shame that well behavior is so rare people give thousands of dollars... We need parent school!
We need so many more people like this kid
Great job young man. Stay the course.
based young man
Finally  some positive reports on people.  They should do a postive for every negative  on tv and internet.  But no fke sketches or news. The world would be a better place!
It was a baddie on the ID that's why lol WOMEN being beautiful and taking care of yourself goes a long way 💯
It’s amazing & well deserved 3k 🔥💯💪🏻
As a teenager my gf and i found a brand new iphone in a park, check contacts and called "mum" to get the address. Walked like half an hour to the address gave the mum the phone and we were super excited to have done a good deed but the reactions was so upsetting. She just said a short unemotional thanks, picked the phone and closed the door and it wasn´t like she was living in an area were only rich people live.
The kind young man with good head on his shoulders, really does deserves that reward money the 2 kind woman raised so he remembers it for rest of his life and glad the woman have shared what he did so hopefully more people get inspired 💯 his mom raised him well 💯  👏👏👏👌
I've found 3 wallets within 35 yrs of my life. All had money in them one even had a little pot. Lol. One of them was at my sons school during drop off time and it was a mexican family, the father had a lot of at least couple thousand in his wallet. I knocked on the van door and gave it to his wife. Never any rewards by the owners, but I neve had any expectations. I know God seen my good deed and thats all that truly matters. ❤
Glad to see their are still HONEST kids out there!! Good job!
Im proud of you, young man !!
good for you young man! God  bless!
Salute to that young man….
He brought the purse back because she got them dsl's n he was tryna see what shes working wiff
Well done young man
Lmao She bad on the DL pic. Thats why he did that bro. I know the game lmfao. Still a good deed tho.
Well done young man proud of you from a 53 year old Scottish dad my son would do same you got a great mum and you do her proud
If that's you son im so proud of you. I'm proud of all my children
Who is this boy?
Emotional intelligence is sometimes overlooked.Good guy.
Fair play
She likes Him
Wonderful!!!!! Bless you both!!!!!
He probably the one who stole it
Good parenting shows!!
He has one proud mother I bet
17 and he has great morals and the parents did a very perfect job in raising him right. I applaud both him and his parents.
I dropped my wallet at Target. A guy brought my wallet to my house. He wouldnt take a reward. Lot of good people out there
I’ve returned 7 wallets   With the hope of karma if it was to happen to me
There is a good kid inside ALL OF US but in this society WILL NOT LET US SHOW IT, MY MEN
The kid saw her driver's license and was like DAMN 🤣
Dude saw chicks ID saw she was fire and became the hero real quick 😂
Nice young man.❤
This is great but the part about the woman being confused when he returned it? Like she didn’t realize her purse was missing?
Good upbringing
Integrity.. getting rare. Awesome Adrien(?), and a shout out to Adrien's mama 👍🏻💪🏻✊🏻❤️
Normally people steal a purse to get money lol.
え？当たり前のことじゃないの?なんでニュースになってるの?w
now there will be more kids stealing purses only to bring them back and ask for reward
Lots o great kids around
That’s something they say in military. To do the right thing even when no one’s looking I’m sure this kids mom is so so proud of him I sure am and I’ll bet he has a bright future god bless
Nice story, can't judge a book by it's cover, that kids mom deserves a hell of a lot of credit. I hope he took her out to dinner :)  Congrats to Adrian
he’s mad finee
the young man needs to put his motto on a shirt...........he would make a fortune...good job young blood,good job
<3333333333333333333333333333333!:-D:-*xxx
Isn’t it a handbag?
Got me crying fr!!! That is beautiful!!! Shout out to the PARENTS‼️ But let’s really get into it…this young man took the time to get this purse back to this woman…and further to it… did it because it was the right thing to do!! I’m beyond proud and this is another pivotal reason why we as humans, regardless of the skin color and where we are from do not judge a book by its cover‼️‼️‼️
He returned it because they weren’t nun in it
What a sweetheart
Family oriented boy, good job bro👍👍
THATS A GOOD KID!  HIS PARENTS RAISED HIM WELL!😊😊😊
That’s a definition of a real young homie.
This is a good man❤❤❤😂
Great guy! Well raised.
Don’t judge an Edgar by his cover
I mean he got that nice asss car me not hurting fr😂
Good job mom, you raised a morally upstanding young man! This restores my faith in humanity 😊
Wow!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊
*Beautiful.*
He’s so fine omg 😭
That young man was raised right. Congratulations to his mom, too.
Starts with parents! Good job man
God bless you, young man.  You displayed honor, discipline, and true, Latino, family values.  You honored your parents, you didn't steal, and you reacted the way you were raised.   Your future is bright, keep living for the good of humanity.  You're a special young man.
John 3:16, “For GOD so loved the world, that HE gave HIS only begotten SON, that whosoever believeth in HIM should not perish,but have everlasting life.”❤
I don't get why this is so very special. That is just perfectly normal behavior. At least it is in Denmark, where im from. Guess its different in the US..
This made me cry...repaying kindness with kindness... awesome!!
I returned a wallet I found in a wealthy area, and the guy called the cops and tried to have me arrested…
Ok so what did they give him? 🤣
Thanks to his family who raised him :)
We all know why he returned the bag after seeing that driver license picture 😂
Integrity is priceless
Cool kid. Wholesome aura.
Good manners starts from home The boy's mom must be very proud
Where is this guy now I need to know!
This teenager is a very good person and he deserves a reward 😁❤️❤️
Dumbass woman, someone’s generation has nothing to do with their morals.
bro def snatched atleast 30 for an 8th
❤❤❤❤❤
Bruh just came up on the baddest milfs in the game lmao
Exactly.. If I lost my purse I'd be freaking out so of course I'd want someone to return it to me and so I'd do the same for someone else. Never found a purse but I have found 2 phones and a set of keys outside my apartment before and of course returned them.
And they were roommates
THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF GOOD PARENTING.   WELL DOWN MOM AND DAD👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Not all young people are bad only the ones they’ve been raised poorly by their parents.
Hes fine omg
My name is Melina
💯💯💯💯
Absolutely love it. Hat on backwards, big gold chain, baggy pants and such an upstanding young man. Don't judge a book by it's cover.
See People!! Doing the right thing also pays!! And they won't take that away from you!!
Great advice..I'm gonna pass that on..good mom.
Good kid and he was raised right.
That’s a good kid. I hope he was able to put that money towards his first car if he didn’t have one. 🙂
I would prefer another reward by her and her friend 🧡 forget the 3k bro
Done this 3 times in my life. 1 of the times, I got 5 dollars, the other times I got nothing. I obviously didn't do it to get a reward but after seeing this video... I kinda feel like I found the wrong purses..
He must already have a decent income and didn’t need what was in her purse lol
I left my purse in a cart at Walmart. I wasn't quite home when I realized I didn't have it so I turned around and went right back. No luck. Went inside and asked at Customer Service. No luck. When I got home my son was holding my purse, everything in it, and told me a lady had dropped it off. I have no idea how she found out where to take it because I had just moved and there was nothing in my purse or wallet that had my new address on it. But she got it to me. She was an angel!
And he fine
People may not be watching but Allah always is.
That's shocking story I lived in California San Diego and all I saw was pure evil and soulless people you don't want to ask questions about how to get somewhere people didn't even know how to communicate they just left you there I remember living in New York they don't act like that at all I would take New York over Cali any day
He's a cholo or at least looks like one / dresses like one. He has ulterior motives. He's guilty. Rodriguez? Yep. Definitely guilty.
the golden rule bb!
You ALL did the right thing ❤
Said fact is that something that should be completely normal and casual, is nowadays so rare that it’s on the news
Good kid. He's going to do well in life.
she said, there is hope for our younger generation. but for theirs its long gone, especially in the us XD  i like it, very ironic
Eliana is a dime
If that was my son id be very proud of him
Ty for sharing something positive
well done kid good job
He even looks like he's respectful, something about that face, what a guy and great parents surprisingly lol funny it's more surprising the parents are considered good to me lol  As someone dealing with a not so great person making my work-life balance dive off a cliff this is a breath of fresh air😂
Crazy that people are surprised because this happens all the time without people noticing because it isnt filmed on a ring doorbell camera nor is it on the news because more than 90% of people would do exactly the same thing
Reward to be honest !
That was so sweet lets u know there are good people out here
I've done that at least 7 times I can remember and never once got a reward and would refuse if offered. I did have one guy actually call the cops on me for returning a wallet. He was upset I didn't give his wallet to my supervisors at the store and asked that I be trespassed from his property. I will still continue to do the right thing.
Love this
3k for returning a purse??? Imma go hunting for lost items now
I've done the same, and got nothing in return. Which is fine, thats not why I did it.
His Mom had a lot to do with his upbringing ..Mom great job 🎉🎉🎉
I have returned  numerous purses, wallets and valuables to customers when I was driving a cab. Some were very grateful and some didn’t even care to properly thank me. I’m going to tell both experiences. 1. The bad one: after my shifts end, I walked up stairs of the building to my apartment, I found a purse with lots of stuff in it. From the id , I was able to pull a phone # off the phone book, there was no cell phones back then😊. It turned out to be from a different city. So I called on my land line, had to pay expensive long distance later. An elderly woman answered, she said it’s her daughter’s she still uses her address, but lived in my building. So I got the apt #, took the elevator, knocked at her door, she opened it, and I explained what I went through to find her. She literally snatched out of my hand , with a cold thanks you barely hear, looked like she forced herself to say it, then slammed the door shut .   2. I pick up a university student waved at me, dropped her in a house party that was like 100 students gathered on that evening. Once I made it back to where I normally park, I realized she left a purse. I looked for id, got a name, the purse was full of cash, credit cards, valuables. Quickly drove back and asked for her name without saying why I’m there. So a guy went inside, shortly, she came out , as soon as she saw me, she ran towards me and I handed over her purse. She was so happy, she kept hugging me. I said open the purse, check for everything before I leave because I opened it to find your id and name. She did and cried from happiness. She mentioned that the money was going towards her rent and her expenses for that month. She insisted to give me as much as I ask for. I laughed and replied, “ but I could’ve got all your money if I didn’t have to return it, but that belongs to you”.  I tried to leave but she did not let me go , forcefully handed $200 . But I refused that amount. At the end, I just took $40.  People, if you find something, return it, as you want thing be returned to you when you loose them.
Good Boy 😂😂
Eliana is beautiful
Kudos to him what a great young man 👍
About 20 years ago I found a purse on a curb. With cash. I called a random person from their address book, who directed me to the owner. The owner called my phone. I returned the purse all the way to her door. She was very grateful, said thank you, and I went on with my day. Where's my news story, my 30M views, my 870K likes, and $3,000? Nah.
People are invariably good, and they help others because its the only thing to do!  It simply doesn't cross their mind to do anything other than help people to be reunited with their lost belongings.  There is nothing like seeing the surprise and joy on the faces of people whose belongings have been returned to them by strangers...
So lovely to hear positive news. Awesome job by the guy.
Great kid.
Personality is what you do when everyone is watching.  Character is what you do when nobody is.
Good job mom
Great kid, and great reward to him
Proof of how important parenting is and why you can’t judge someone on looks. I would have never thought this backward hat, chain wearing kid would do this.
The aunt is a smoke show.
Seeing this 2 years later...hope you are having a great life Adrian!
From outside he looks like a thug but inside a pure goold hearted guy❤
Or it was set up guys come on read through the lines
😊😊
The good you put out into the world always has a way of coming back to you.
You know he is one of those immigrants you all complain about
Karma
he was tryna get lucky when he saw the pics i would have went to the house too lls smart boy  lol
Max was here
Act of kindness and integrity just shows there are still good people around.
So nice to hear of this wonderful young man.
GOD Bless Him
He saw that DL picture and was like I hope this lady is super grateful, know what I'm saying, player, lol, jk
imagine if he actually stole and returned it because she was rich and he got 3k. would be hillarious
Plot twist: he was the reason it got lost in the first place and this is a scam
What a awesome guy
I would of refused the reward money but maybe that's just me but good on him.
That’s what we should watch on tv Good things
Probably saw the aunt in the wallet🤣🤣
Not only was he raised right those ladies were raised right doing something nice for him to reward him, I'm sure he will spend the money wisely and appreciate it
Guy was tryna get laid.
Really hope she paid back her husband the 3 grand of his money she spent
I hope that this fellow is doing well and successfully in life, and continuing to follow in the path of dignity and righteousness.
It’s easy to do the right thing when everyone is looking. Who indeed acts with integrity tend to do it without anyone aware. And it actually starts with the simpliest things.   What I do not like is when people reward integrity in such way. Because then it turns into a point of interest to act good in order to get a reward. Because who ever acts like that should nevar expect such thing.  If you are ever object of true human act, you shall not necesarily reward it back with money. Instead, consider you duty to do the right thing to somebody else without expecting nothing in return. Whenever enough people do that, the reward for all of us will be inmense, and it will worth more than 3.000 american dollars.
I prayed that young man don't mixed with the wrong crowd..😊
That is a good kid, but you have to give it to the parents who raised him 😊
What a cool dude!
That man was raised in a good family with good morals.. well done lad 😊
❤❤❤
The importance of rewarding young people when doing good!
🙏🏾
Karma +100
This young man will be blessed ❤ and he was raised very well. Good parenting goes a long way
Praying for our unborn children
A good young man
Great job young man 🙏
Parents teach your kids to be like this kid
In America, this is an act of miracle. In my country this a routine.
Thats right! Cause God is always watching! ❤
Getting praised for being civilized, crazy ahh world we live
Can we meet the parents :-)
I love this video , I watch it every time I need a lift.
He was raised to be a gentleman. Great job!
I’m not saying what he did wasn’t commendable, but the fact we live in a world where people need to make a big deal out of something that everybody should do for one another is sad. Great kid though
OMG THIS IS MY DADS FRIEND WTF THIS WAS JUST ON MY RECOMENDED
Great parents for teaching, a great young man for listening.
All I can say is WOW GREAT KID
Kind of sick of these stories, don't get me wrong good on the bloke, well done.  But the whole we asked other people to pay him/them or whatever as thanks.
I would like to see more stories like this instead of all the negative stuff the Internet pours out.
That's dope and refreshing at the same time.
Good stuff bro
Central cee
A shining light in a very dark world
"Always do the right thing, even when no one is watching" That's a little bit hard to accomplish lately, and this video is a proof of that.
I found 6k at a costumer house, returned and she gave me $20 bucks I bought a scratch  ticket and got $500. Had gas for my car for free for the whole month!
❤👍🇩🇪
There is still hope regarding the young generation.
Good on the kid and also good on the lady and her friends for their kind gesture as well.
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸👍👍👍👍😎😎😎😎
A certain recent administration in 2025 would send ICE after this young gentleman and his family.  YA I SAID IT, I'm white, wink wink from California. I LOVE my Chicano brothers!!!
In about 2006 my husband of 31 years passed away leaving me to raise our two daughters ages 12 and 14 myself. We decided to go out to a local park to go swimming a few months after the funeral, and I was kind of out of it but I wanted the girls to have fun. But I was in full-blown grieving. I was not firing at all cylinders. I left my wallet on the pay booth where you have to pay five dollars to get into the park. I didn’t realize it till about an hour later and I went back the wallet was gone. I had a lot of cash in that wallet and I needed it. I thought “well that sucks… I’m gonna have to call the police and report everything stolen…“ And I started crying. but just by chance I thought well maybe somebody turned it in probably not but I’ll check with the park attendant. Lo and behold they HAD turned it in. I had $300+ in cash in that wallet and a bunch of credit cards. Nothing was touched. I never knew who did it and if I did I would’ve done something nice for them but God saw it and he has made note of it.❤
I was in Canada last year and lost my wallet with credit cards and $600. in cash. Figured it was gone for good. Someone found it and turned it in to the police and they called me and mailed it back to me in the States. It probably went through a few peoples hands before the cop that called me. Love Canadians.
omg the world is saved
Beautiful! 🙏
Thanks for posting this story. We need more exposure to kindness in these ugly times.
Daily occurrence and expectation in Japan.
God bless Adrian
The future isn’t lost. There’s still hope.
1:45 I think this sentence is so weird, what does she mean by "he could have just taken what's inside the purse". Why would he do that???
It all starts at home... What a wonderful young man.....👏👏👏👏....❤❤❤❤...
Glad the kid was trustworthy, and glad that he was treated properly when he returned the purse. I once had a very different experience returning a lost purse, 60 some-odd years ago. My girlfriend (now my wife of 62 years) and I went 'parking' in a remote corner of a park that was a popular place for teenaged daliances, most of which naturally took place at night. But I worked nights and we were there on a warm sunny afternoon. We went for a walk along the shore of the pond, and I happened to notice a purse barely sticking out from under a bush. Picked it up, found the wallet and ID. Turned out the girl lived a couple towns away, so the next day, I drove over there and rang the bell. Asked if she lived there, and the lady who answered the door said I'd better talk to her husband. She calls him, and he comes to the door and basically accuses me of having my way with his daughter and stealing her purse.  He wanted to see MY drivers license. Finally, he called her to inspect the contents to "see what this guy might have stolen" from it. She said everything was in order, and her cash was still in the wallet.  The guy was still beside himself, refused to believe either of us when we insisted that we'd never met, and told me that if I ever went near his daughter again he'd have me arrested. I occasionally wonder whatever happened to her, because from what I could see, her home life was none too happy.
For acts like this rewards are far greater than money, God Bless this young man, there is hope for humanity yet 🙏
Wow imagine having 3000$
Good parenting made this young man one of the greatest role model we wanted to see.
I just watched a video with a young model stealing her Ubers tips so this is a nice reset to see a kind young man. I hope life is nothing but kind to him. 🙏🏽🫶🏽
This kid is a hero for others to look up to . Bravo Adrian .  Watching from 🇨🇦
God bless him❤
You know how some people say people need more people like him we need to be like him he is a honest young man and his parents raised him right good job young man your a blessing.
this is beautiful let's get back to this
I have that marc jacobs purse..great guy
That is a squared away young man.
It’s not the younger generation, it is his education and family who raised him up right
GOD bless this young man. 🎉

When someone gets robbed and gta and you return it and don’t get your prize😂
Thats a good kid. And has a good mom.
One time they delivered an Xbox one to our house and my son opened it thinking it was his. When I got home from work he told me thank u dad your the best. Broke my heart to tell him it wasn’t his. My son went to the house to give it to the person it belonged to. And they were so impressed with him that they gave it to him. Pretty cool
We need so many more people like this kid
Great story ❤
Good for him and his parents! His parents raised him right!
ICE come through too?😂
There is hope
its insane to me that returning lost property with an ID and address inside, is seen as remarkable. This is standard in n the UK? Only thugs and addicts and brutal people would steal the contents
This is great. Thank you
“There’s hope for this generation” had me rolling
Good kid!!
He’s a nice teenager because he has a wonderful Mom. I also believe Karma like he said we hope someone will return his purse if they found it like him.
Absolutely awesome this Young gentleman was raised right I see videos of young people on campus stealing signs of people they don't agree with and not knowing freedom of speech violating the constitution of the us because their feelings matter More than the protected rights of citizens what are these children getting tought in school not to believe in our constitution to trash our laws so I love seeing youth being lawful like this because our country has lost its way
that America  teens ❤
Yup! The Golden Rule "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you".
This young man will truly be blessed for his good heart great job mom your son is awesome ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Where’s the go fund me?
Plot twist…they kept the 4k from the go fund me…😅  Imagine 🤦‍♂️ 😅
For inside edition digital your name is WHO?
Elianas a stunner!
Who cares?
🤘🤘
Plot twist. He set this up for a reward. 😏🤣
That’s real nice. Really is.  But back in the day, these deeds weren’t exceptional
SWEET BLESSING IN HONESTY..A BIBLICAL VIRTUE
Oh that gives me Hope for the world.
Tue Recht und scheue Niemand.
He deserves jail time. Dont believe his lies. Cant trust those people. Fr
I returned a purse once, found it in the middle of the road, stuff scattered everywhere. I picked up her stuff, put it back in her purse, and found an adress from some personal info inside. Got to the lady's house, she was drunk out of her mind, gave me a "thank you darling," turned around, went inside, and continued talking on the phone to her friend. Somehow it was one of the most casual interactions I've ever had 😂
Honorable young man who has great parents.Blessings follow people who bless.
Bro def looked at her ID and thought abt Cougar cheeks immediately.
Kid is smart. No money in the te purse? so why not return it maybe there's a reward in the end of it ?
この少年のお母さんが素晴らしい お母さんの教えを真っ直ぐに受け取って育った この少年は天使だ
Yea right… she thought he was a thug and scared.
He has a melong necklace. Good guy through and through
I doubt he would have returned it without the incentive of a $3000 reward, he should have said no I don't want such a vast amount of money, $10 for Mcdonalds will do. 🙄
You would think mother Teresa raisedhim
Oh Adrian! What a wonderful young man..He was raised right ❤
Awesome but did they keep the 700+, remaining or thr title is just approximate ? XD
I can’t get 500$ for having brain cancer on my gofund me lol
when you look like a thug, but you actually deserve a hug.
I return peoples thing I don’t get $3k 😅😂😂😂
Fantastic job young fella. Don’t ever change who you are
He is the embodiment of "Be the change you want to see in the World"- Gandhi
So somebody gave something back that didn't belong to them, aint that whst you're supposed to do. People want praise & rewards just for taking part these days, the world is very sad now.
Im sure bro didnt sleep alone that night
We need more parents like his mom!!!
Thats what you call being raised right!!!
Yo! Respect!
I need stories like this to give me hope and regain my faith in humanity. Thank you.
Seen this before, due to the already "liked" upvote, however it still brought tears to both eyes. It's a testament to the mothers' teaching when raising her young child to manhood. ❤
Is he already deported by Trump?
If something isn't mine, it's someone else's
Title should be Nice thug returning purce. He looks so gangsta😎
I did that. Not that much $$$ but didn’t want or excepted anything
how does the tia look younger then the niece
he def stole it
0:06 as some one in that generation im going to have to stop you right there. There is absolutely no hope for this generation. Were cooked. Fried, Deep fried.
Whoever raised this kid did a good job
All the good deeds I've caused my wallet to be -7k😂
I gotta give props to the boys' mom to because she was the one who taught him those values as well.
"There's hope for younger generation" - WTF, than they didn't gave him money at first bruhh
YOU DEADBEAT HOES PAN HANDLING ONLINE TO PAY THIS GUY SHEESH
I found a wallet once and returned it to the owner. He was thrilled and it gave me great joy to be able to bring such relief to my fellow human. Living honestly is the only way to live!
Great job, young man. Just know, someone is always watching.
Have any Company hired this fantastic fellow? A true human being. ❤
I love that kid AND his mom. Bendiciones.
This happened to me and a friend when we were 15, we found a purse in the parking lot. We didn’t take the purse because we felt bad, so we just took the money.
That's a kid who will NOT spend the rest of his life in the ghetto.
Good job, bro. I found a wallet stuffed with cash, lying on the floor at Menards, and took it straight to the service desk and asked for a manager.  She said there was a call and that they were very interested in getting it back.  I could have used that money, but it wasn't mine.  Simple as that.
If only this was real
Awesome, setting up a go fund me page for him was a great move.
Let's add some global context:  Please keep in mind that 95% of German teenagers would have done this
Is there an update on this fella?
You two can give him the ultimate gift 😉
Good people inspire others to be good when they do good deeds, we really need more like that kid today
Good things will happen in his life. Thank you
Amazing good job, his parents raised him right!
Your parents raised you right ,
3k damn what a generous person😅
Integrity
El qué conozca a Melina Márquez… dígale qué si no tiene esposo o compromiso alguno… quisiera llegar a conocerla un poco mejor. Ésta mujer es extraordinariamente bélla en MIS ojos 👀🤦🏻‍♂️…😍😘
Great role model
20 bucks ??? Bro he should’ve kept that 3k😊
Sin duda es una buena persona pero a lo mejor quería conocer a la dueña del bolso que se ve muy bien.
Well played young man. 👏👍
Dont judge a book by its cover
Mexican helping out Mexican
Yes!  This is what people should do!  REWARD good behavior!!!!
That didn't seem racist to me.  Could CRT be wrong?
the thing is someone is always watching ..God.
If everyone could raise their kids that way our world would be a much better place. Most young men who look like him would be too embarrassed to be seen walking with a purse letting alone thinking of doing a deed like this. He deserves every dollar that gets raised. Hell, maybe they could garnish the wages of bad acting police officers and pay this kid to instruct them on doing the right thing.
Good lad. The world needs more people like him.
Seem like 6/100 kids in the world were raised right whew
Горжусь этим парнем! Совесть, Честность, Честь, Достоинство!  Человек!
My man checked that ID for the address and seen how hot she was😂 he thought dam right im returning this
homs looks like a real g
What a honesty person he is. 😢
Mom did a great job with him!
All is not lost in the human race
So nice for you to do the gofundme for this teen!
We can not be all bad ❤❤❤
There's no hope as he was a gem in the rough.
Good family, great guy. Let's try to build on people with this foundation. We can become A greater country
No camera was pulled out by the young gentleman to post it on soc med. Salute. 🫡
Black community should learn something
I did and found the same thing at Walmart 3 yrs ago and didn’t want the 100.00 reward. And did except any $$$
But he kept the cash right?
Great kid!!
This young man is a true gem.
omg he’s so fine wtf
The looks like he would steal something but thats the problem these people only judge by how they look not how they act. this kid did a great deed and im proud of him great job man
Lol he probably was the one who swiped the purse in the first place
Wow well done matey boy.
I lost my wallet once and a lady found it and rang my house. all the money was still there, I gave her £10 and thanked her. there are good people in the world
Great story
I just came across this and it really touched me . I thought my kids where a dying breed but its so great to see that parents are still instilling good morals into their children. So many are the opposite sad to say. ❤❤❤❤
❤his parents should be proud this kid is a saint❤️🙏🏽
lol that's normal in Muslim countries
Who wanna Bett he went through it first 😂
This is a good man with a great upbringing.
If it was me I would have expected another reward from those Mommies 😏
I’m sorry but one person doing a good deed doesn’t give hope for an entire young generation. It’s still screwed
Two things can be true:   1. It’s a kind gesture that takes integrity to go out of your way to return her purse.  2. I think he may have had a crush on her younger ID pic and wanting to see her in person😂
Swear i watched a movie like this but the woman was a psycho
Thats just normal behavior nothing Else. What spoils the whole Story is the Crazy high reward.
Sent to the left for that kid!
This is a perfect example of never judge a book by its cover. 🥹🤗
God has incredible plans for this young man! 🙏🏼
i did a lot of these when i was a lil kid. :D once i was walkin with a pretty girl try to spend some nice time with her and while we pass bye on a playground ive seen a phone. went there and check the numbers on the phone. picked my one and started call the mother. her mother ask the kid about the phone and the little girl was unable to tell where it was. so the mom was telling her that guess what? someone just talk to me he found it . me and the girl with me visited the family and they gived me a pack of cigarette and a wine as a gift.  the mission was allready fun with the girl but after that even chill with some cigarette and a wine was cherry on top
That’s a great young man 💜 respect
His mom taught him what God told us to do help people in secret and reap your reward in Heaven
One good deed deserves another.
When I realise how crazy life is in this day & age….it’s videos like this that still keep me sane 😊👏👏
He has the same first name as me
Who is from 2025?
I used to work in a grocery store.  It wasn't uncommon to find purses in grocery carts in the parking lot.
Awesome young man   Know your parents are proud of you ❤
Such a good kid!!!
Something positive. Yeah
I found a drivers license in a parking lot, wasnt expired, so I returned it to the owner.  Found a bank card with a persons checking/savings numbers.   Again, no idea if the accounts were active, dropped if off to a branch of the bank on the way to work the next day.    Loosing ID and such sucks and is a hassle. If you find it, try and help the people out from a headache.
great lad hope he doing good :D
Great Story
What a gentleman!
Even after living in NYC and LA for many years this is waft I would expect from a fellow human being. He is a good person and did the right thing. A small reward is a nice thing but that’s not why he did it. I don’t think we should be shocked by a good deed.
That is a good kid. I wish the best for him.
Am sure you didn't had 10$mill in access in purse
“The time is always right to do what is right” - Dr Martin Luther King Jr
It goes to show you that good parenting matters. Mom of the year
If a possible future employer does a google search on him before offering him a job, he is in there. His parents must be so proud, and the internet will remember him forever for all the right reasons.
Well done all ways be honest 👍
Now that's a honest person, 👌
Good job bud
Man isn’t there move where a girl returns a green purse to a old women and truns out the old lady is a psychopath
He said damn she bad
cant belive doing a what i always thought was "normal"  deserves 3k lmao
I was 11 when i found a wallet and tracked down the older lady that lost it .I contacted the number that was left in it and they lead my to the owners address. The wallets owner then acted like I was the thief and accused me of stealing the money  from it. Why would i return a wallet that i just robbed? It left a bitter taste in my mouth that i did all that just to be accused to be a thief. I wasnt looking for an award, just a 'thank you' would've made my day. ( reason why i returned even though i saw no money in it was because she had a ton of cards and id's and photos in it)
God Bless that kid and have A Blessed Day Everyone 🙏
That man is going places in life, if not then I have no hope in life.
I’ve done this ten times in my life at least n never got a dime lol.
There was prolly nothing in the bag so he returned it
my utmost RESPECT for this young man.  Karma will reward you many times over for your good deed.
Good youngster much respect to the little brother 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Dude, the teen DROVE to the house.  I would have just given it to management.  This Samaritan went the extra mile.
Can we have more news like this please and thanks
it started with good parenting. it shows that you can't just produce kids but you need to parent them and teach them to be good person. nonetheless the boy has done great job
quality young man
Great things should follow this young man for life!
You can see the good in his face. Well raised.
This is an amazing story and it truly warms my heart. 💗💗
Never judge a book by its cover
Respect.
So this is what happens in GTA V if you return the stolen purse!
3K well earned brother. Keep up the good work <3
That young man was raised right ❤
I guess the Pass it on Ad really is Inspirational
Go fund me makes 3750$, they keep the $750 and give him $3k 😂
Good Parents make Good Children x
Nice vibes
His mother gave him integrity  She must be very proud of her son and should feel proud of the job she has done raising him
That’s wonderful, but it is pathetic that everyone is shocked that young person would do the right thing. I’m 64 years old and the majority of people did the right thing when we were kids. We need to teach these good morals to our young kids! He should actually mentor kids!
Was cleaning the bathrooms at the grocery store i work at and found a purse inside the womens bathroom anywho i gave it to my supervisor that night and put it in our vault 30 mins go by and lady called to see if her purse was there well sure enough it was she came got it she pulled her billfold out to find 600 dollars still there lol i never seen somebody so happy yet i dont blame her aha
it’s not a suprise us younger generations would do that too, as long as ur not an opposition. it’s the 20% of da youngins that’s making us look bad.
Give a thumbs up  if you ever returned somebody's purse or wallet
That kid was raised right well done young man
Now thats what Jesus would do. ♥
Might it be staged to later set up a go fund me? 🤷‍♂️ I don't know 🤷‍♂️ If it's real, Nice job brother. This evil world needs actions like this more than ever.
Adrien ❤❤❤
Top lad. His mum should be proud.
If hes 17 year old why does he have tatoos somone explain cause im dumb or then im just on to sum
I love that these two ladies started a GoFundMe for this wonderful teenager. He was definitely raised right!
speaks a lot about him AND his mom
I would like to meet the mother and shake her hand !
Never happens like this
Great job 😉😉young man!!!
@fineyoungman
What a beautiful young man, the World needs more like him.
All good deeds come around!!!!
All good deeds come around!!!!!
He came back because he saw that she was a dime on her ID. My boy wanted a smash. Now he got 3k and a possible smash lmao
Nice 👍 God bless 🙏🏼
Yo Adrian. You did it.
Great Young man❤
Good man
BRAVO, BRAVO BOY...KEEP UP WITH GOOD WORK..
Good kid lift him up keep him on the side of good
Family Values and Honesty! great young man and very well deserved reward!
Integrity is a trait no money can buy!
“Always do the right thing, even when no-one is watching” beautiful! What an amazing mom and an incredible young man, to her credit ❤️
Real man don't steal or cheat to get money
Yall gave all that money to go fund me lol
There's hope in our country
That's good.
Good lad!!
Salute to you dude....
Good dude nice to see
THIS IS WHY YOU RAISE YOUR KIDS RIGHT. This is what happens. You don't need to be a perfect parent. But you at least need to try.
i guess i should do this more often cause who knows u might get something good in return
He loves his mother and listened to her.
Raised exceptionally, right!
now that's a MAN
So did he get the money?
A fine young man. He can sleep at night knowing he did his best. Thank you sir! There so many good people doing good things who will never be known. Isn’t that wonderful to think about.
It all starts at home with mom and dad.
bro definitely stole it
Kudos boy 👍
that’s my son yall
I know exactly why he returned it to that miiiiiilf 😂
I love this ❤
👍🏼❤️🤗👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
THAT'S A GOOD KID! I AM GLAD HE GOT SUCH A NICE REWARD.
I hope that lady sees a doc for thyroid issues. genuinely.
He has had the same upbringing as i did, my mom always told me the same thing. Do right in the eyes of the lord !
Yes Indeed ❤
I would like to see his reaction to receiving the go fund !!!
Good job dude
Good kid
Hella pot to buy with 3k “” 😆
Least theirs still honest people in the world
THis makes me grin <3 What a good kid!
What a gentleman! Mom did a great job
How in the world did 5k people dislike this video?
Wish I could like this video a thousand times! May God protect this soul.
Thank you sir.
They should have shown them giving him the $3000...Wth?
According to the motto: Do not do to others what you would not like done to yourself!
Raised properly..and it stayed with him….good for you momma be super proud of your son……wish I had some extra bucks to send your way to have you two go out for a nice meal.
He saw that ID & said .. let me go pay her a visit , she might have a daughter my age.
Good lad.
Bless his heart, ❤ there's not a whole lot of 17 yr olds tht  would of returned the purse
Very good kid.
I've returned phones and wallets LoL
Don’t say oh my g*d say oh my gosh
There's hope for our younger generation lady it your kinds problem to raise all of your kids with morals
And most people would look at him and cross the street. Not knowing he has a heart like our Lord and savior calls us to have. Bless him always!!!! ❤
wow an actualy decent person thats kind of amazing
Love this!
Bravo that boy and his family 👏👏👏
Right on young man!  Stay the same!
*Respect+*
morals, honor and integrity go a long way, God bless this young man
So proud of him!!!!!
most people give you no reward...sometimes not even a thanks.
My question is how do you forget your purse
Good man ! ❤
Way to be Adrian.
She bad, no wonder he brought the purse back!! 🤣
:( so sweet and genuine I pray I can be like him one day.
People talking about “hope in younger generation” lol it’s cause the real ones don’t chase cameras! They get noticed and someone else captures it. All yall see is bad on news and social media and that’s  it. As a manager in fast food I get a lot of kids that come through. I’ll tell ya boy, there’s plenty of hope!!!
stud
There IS hope for the younger generation. Too bad for every good kid there's 47 bad kids. So it's a slim hope.
🤜🤛
Iam happy 4 bru
what his @@?? :(
Good to see young people doing the right thing 🥰 Jesus sees all and blesses those who follow along his narrow path of righteousness. Blessings 🙏
Good man
Men like this guy gives me faith back to people
Excellent story
Just love it
His parents raised a respectable honest young man they should be proud. ❤
Hope he got he 3K
Thank u YOUNG MAN ❤💙💙💙💙🥰
This is excellent
All young people aren't bad. They're raised by bad parents.
All my respect goes to this guy
There’s still hope 🫶🏻
I'm going to go look for purses & wallets right after this video!
Thats called Aloha 💪🏽🤙🏽
Lil bro will win in life moving like that
i love good people, may God bless this young man❤️
smash
This video will always be a convenient character reference when he starts applying for jobs. 😂😂😂
Nice young man
That is how I want to raise my child
That's a good dude we need more like that his parents or caretakers did him well and brought him up properly even in this woke time... just goes to show it is possible
I love that they awarded him❤our young people need to feel special and appreciated when they do good. It’s so many young people that choose wrong so it’s awesome when they choose right.
he got over 17000$ from what I understand
Crazy how good deeds now now to nationally broadcasted... When it should be normal..
You just got a call he called the perch😅
Whats wrong with her face cheeks. 😂😂😂
I've lost a wallet before and it really sucks. Not so much losing the cash but having to get a new driver's license, cancelling debit and credit cards etc. It's just a awful. I found a guy's wallet outside Subway a few months ago and contacted him through Instagram and he came to my house to pick it up. The guy was so happy he tried to pay me but I wouldn't take the money. He just put the cash from the wallet in my mail box lol. So it pays to do the right thing and I'm glad this kid got rewarded
I love to see 🧡 great job !
I remember I returned a wallet with homegirl’s disney pass, credit cards and ID. I only wanted avocados from her tree and never got any 💔
And that's integrity. Good job young man and ofc the mom.
God bless his heart
Good for him. His parents taught him right.
I found a phone the person called it and gave me 40 dollars I didn't want anything
he will be a great leader someday!
Ey foo, I found this bag n sh, iono, it's like empty or whatever
That's awesome. He's an example
He deserves every praise and every penny.
Well done, young man. Keep it up. Listen to your mother. You will be a success......
besides a unproachable appearance. a good deeds in his hearts.
He deserves everything good that comes his way ....excellent young man
A real Man
This shows how important good upbringing is. God bless all good and kind-hearted people in the world.
So Much bec a black boy did bring it back lmao, when I do it in my country they won’t believe me they will say “ye bring it back before we catch you “  they will think it’s an smart move
Im sorry Lads, im gonna say it, keep the money. I take a Date with the Aunt instead.
Even when no one is watching…  ❤
It’s a normal thing in Japan but I know it’s a rare thing in the States because I used to live there😂
Very fine young man
MORE OF THIS!!!
Graat kid ❤❤❤❤❤
Excellent young man!!!
this is a news story?
Amazing young man
GOOD BOY❤
Videos like this give me hope in humanity ❤🌏
nice guy. We need to be like this guy
God Bless That Young Man & The Owner & All Those Involved.
Good kid we need more people like thet
Hell yea, that kid is kick ass dude. Love a positive story like this. Great parenting and great character.
The recording volume is set WAAAAAAAAY too high. This is just painful to listen to.
Good parenting speaks for itself. Great story.
Weldone son , you will go a long way in life xx
He saw how cute the girl looked lol
People talk like this used to be a normal thing that kids did, but back when I was a kid in the 80s I don't know A SINGLE kid who would have done this, the attitude was very much "finders keepers, losers weepers". That's what the boomers taught us.
2 milfs
The scariest thing is that it makes local news that people can be decent to eachother...
Atta boy! ❤
Even when no ones watching.... ive said that to myself for a long time...
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Sadly, we live in a world where doing the obvious has become so rare that it makes the news.
Need more like him!
he only wanted the money, that's why he returned it!
❤
Sad that this is so rare in our world that we're all amazed, no? Happy the kid was raised well and he's following his morals, but this shouldn't be shocking.
Love this!!!
Popped up on my feed before, awesome young man right there. Keep that attitude going there mate and you will go places.
This is beautiful but at the same time it says a lot about society about how one kid doing the right thing makes the news, meaning that most people wouldn't. This is both good and bad, good for him, bad for most of us.
Meh cuh edgar here
As wholesome as this video is, it's very sad in a way too... Reason being that there's even a video about someone being raised well and doing the right thing in the first place... Just tells a lot about society... And for that reason yes, the kid is a good one, because even in such a rotten world he minds the words of his mother and does go around doing the right things. Kudos.
Not all heroes wear capes, parents should be very proud ❤
Saved her all the trouble of going through paperwork to get identification. Especially if they’re new Americans. God bless y’all.
Notice how a regular normalized human deed becomes so viral and rare? That's how you know we've lost it.
reward good deeds he willturn out to be a good person when older
Someone raised their children correctly . 😅
Good job dude 🤙
yall, remember this doesnt always happen. cover your face, take the money out and bail.
yall, remember this doesnt always happen. cover your face, take the money out and bail.
Great vid! That kid’s Mom deserves a medal!
Like all teenagers raised here in Switzerland. In America you become news. 🤯
Good kid
Did the same for a Dr Found his wallet full of credit cards and cash  Returned it to him via finding him on Facebook  He gave me and my misses  A box of chocolates   A real cheapskate
Good for you, young man!
What a great kid his mother certainly taught him good values
Good job dude!
That’s Integrity, doing the right thing even no one is watching.Godbless you young man.🙏
my ex husband did just that a long time ago and the woman was ungrateful.
Oh my gosh he’s great.
This gentleman needs a job at the Trump whitehouse!!
Theres hope out there
You know its staged if "the hero" tell you why they give your stuff back.
♥
You know he got raised by good parents
Y’all would call the cops on that kid if he was standing around just saying
Namaste
Lets be real, you're better off taking whatever money is in the purse than getting a "reward". The better reward is whats in the purse 99% of the time don't be fooled by this tom foolery! They don't value their purse enough to  not loose it.
He is so fine ❤
Good thing it wasn't someone from that CULTURE
Great job Adrian!!!
What a good kid....props to whoever raised him, you did an awesome job!  I like how he didnt record himself returning it, he just wanted to do the right thing for the right reasons. Be like this kid y'all.
There is hope but the older generation don't give them opportunity 😂 go to Walmart in Adelanto and you will see
It’s sad that simple acts like this get in the news even tho it should be a normal thing that everybody does
Why does this look like Grove street from San Andreas??😂
That says a lot about him fr not only it’s a turn on for most people but now you know that he would be nice enough to do good deeds to anyone
If someone did that I to me I would’ve asked him if he would wanna come in or buy him a drink
He looks like a stereotypical movie "gangster" kid but is the complete opposite 👏
when stuff like this is on the knews we know for sure we lost our human spirit
Plot twist: he stole the purse but he realized there was no money in it so he decided to return it cause he felt bad.
why is this news
He returned a purse, yall dont gotta glaze him so much damn
He saw the picture on the license and said damn she hot so he returned the purse to get her phone number.
He saw she was hot and wanted to try his luck. It's a strange world where people feel it's so unusual for a person to be decent and honest that it needs to be financially rewarded.
The saddest part about this whole thing is that most people saw a teenage boy wearing chains, backwards cap & sagging pants and thought he was another suburban low life.
Based 🗿
U do the right thing u will be 😇 blessed.
Praise to the kid, but why is this not normalised, how has simple good deeds become newsworthy, have people just forgotten how to be nice that's it's become a surprise when someone does a good deed, is that not pretty depressing lmao
I once found a wallet outside of movie theater full stacked with hundred-dollar bills must have been like two or three thousand dollars in there anyways I didn't look inside I did it turn into the security in the movie theater and that's that
Ah, what a Good lad
The mother of this young man , must  be proud ...
Bro is the one who stole it 💀
This is the kind of news I like watching. What an absolute legends, not recording himself making himself look like a hero on social media just doing what's right.
How sweet, i accidentally left my wallet at a gas station. The only surprise I got after the attendant reluctantly gave it back to me with a eye roll. Was $300 missing that was charged at that same gas station.
The only watching is GOD and GOD rewards his children. ❤
Mans saw there was no cash in it and returned that bish 🤣
Yea right yall tryna get me to be good and give it back
a real gangster
What a good kid👍
Plot twist they’re all related and they scammed the public
Probably had a brick of coke in there.
Well done young man, Jesus saw what you did.
Looks can be deceiving at times, well done kid
This is how the whole island nation Singapore operates. Very difficult to lose anything even if you really want to.
God bless her
I did that once returned a wallet I drove 6 miles dude was like good looking out can u leave I don’t want others to see u on my property smh I’m black im assuming dude was racist it was 745$ inside and I didn’t take it I returned everything
Bruh he stole it from the cart and his mom whopped his ass and made him drive and give it back XDDD
Integrity. What an amazing young man.
I returned someones wallet when i was homeless at 17 i didnt eat for 4 days and got jumped because he said i took the money out and i didn't
What a goo young man...❤❤❤
For that green piece of junk?
If only the news were filled with stuff like this instead
Thanks to his parents apparently this young man was raised properly❤
The the dead looking bowl of expressionless Botox behind the speaker, never even thought to reward the young guy in the moment, then let a public facing funding create a little bit of thanks? ... Not surprised,
i love you >3 Adrian Rodriguez <3
Remember that episode of Doug where he found the old lady’s purse with $14,447 in it, returned it, and he got a pack of spearmint gum? 😂😅
That's a very handsome reward.
And i bet people judge this kid as soon as they see him, smh, good on you carnal 👊
What a pity that this act is so remarkable that it needs reporting.  Imagine a society where this is the norm and the converse is shocking and newsworthy.
if I meet this guy, I'd say yes
Latinos for Trump
The one good story of the month.  The rest is depravity and silliness.
Your awesome dude! Good job mom n dad😊
I bet he has good parents.
That is a MAN. ❤ 💪
There is no hope for the younger generation. One deed doesn’t speak for them all.
That’s Rightious Bro. 👊🏽🔰💫
Good man. But please pull your pants up.
He is definitely not a Billie Eilish Fan. He humbly handles the purse, holding with extreme care. If he is a musician I hope things work out for him and his mother and family
imagine he stole it tho
Well done young man!
Outstand young man!
Far and few.
I found someone’s backpack in a Safeway parking lot, wallet, papers and credit cards flying all over the parking lot. I picked everything up, put it back in the bag, found something with the persons phone number on it, texted him that I was going to leave it with Safeway security.   Two cops came out of no where and arrested me for “theft” — crazy thing that they left the bag in the parking lot where it was eventually legitimately stolen.  I was released after showing the text message on my phone, which caused the cops to check the Safeway cameras.  I was in custody, handcuffed in the back of a police car for about two hours.
Fantastic!! So good to watch this story.
With what’s going on with Leaders of the world I wonder how long this human decency will be around. Kindness and do the right thing is not appreciated in the highest office of the land. 😔
He was raise well by his parents.
What if he had warrant's?
ja das ist meine schmaozschmaozjai
please people my humans brothers and sisters always do the right thing . god always watching .
Good man.
he saw the photo on the ID and figured, "If I return this purse, maybe I will get rewared with some." If you know what I mean.
What ppl won to for some social media clout....
This is why parenting is so important....
What a handsome young man with manners. I wish him well
that kid deserves ALL the prizes!!! he'll do well in life. nice job moms!!
This was a cute story but I think it’s really sad how we reward people now just for doing the right thing
Oh look, black and brown kids wearing baggy clothes and backwards hats aren’t always criminals, huh? All of you magamuffins on here going on about what a great kid he is only after u see proof. But when you see them in the street you call them thugs and criminals and illegals.
That boy returned that purse because he wanted to get to know shordy but yes good deed I see u my boy
in denmark if we found valubales we a req to get 10% finders fee from the owner
I did something similar once.. All I got was a thank you before she practically slammed the door in my face.
is this the kind of standards todays society has? It's a shame society gets impressed by simple things like returning a lost purse. It is a nice thing but to get this impressed just means society is not used to it at all
A Wonder.
Mama is proud of the young man she raised.
Like others have said, that's a great kid, who has received some great parenting. This is a combination that's very difficult to find these days.
Nicely done, dude.
"If I lost my stuff, I would want somebody to bring it back to me"  It's one thing to know the golden rule, it's another thing to live it. We'll done!
hope this young man be rewarded have a good work
What a good kid. When Trump tries to round you up for deportation, come to Canada. You would fit right in.
You're making a big deal about a guy just doing the right thing....is it THAT big a deal? Or do you just expect EVERYONE to be a thief?
Crazy that this isn’t just considered normal behavior.
His mom did well❤❤🎉🎉
It was staged, look it up
Heavies
Bro dont know what finders keepers is 💀
fake
Top man ;)
So when women ask “Where have all the good men gone?”, they haven’t gone anywhere but you have to raise them, teach them and cherish them.
kids Mom creating the world she wants her kid to live in. good job momming
Now that's a true American boy I'm proud to share this world with.
Those two women looked fine asf
That was.  Not   Very very nice
I did this and got gifts from a Cadillac dealership owner !
Good virtues keep up teddy katalunya ziwani buru emba
Never judge a book by its cover  ❤❤❤
I returned a lost wallet once and got the police called on me being accused of stealing it. Took two hours and a trip to the police station and interrogation to get out of it. I think the reason was because I had long hair , earrings and a skateboard. I’m not sure if I would do it again. Drop it in a mailbox or at the fire station.
"Do the right thing even when no one is looking". He should become a Firefighter!
This is news we need to be seeing
What a fake show circus like the Trump and Sport and everything, including the KGB agent Elon Moskov.
Those few decent kids don't make any difference. I'm afraid that all hope is lost.
Kinda sad that this is worth a story
Right on!!! 😊
I admit I don’t trust most kids who dress that  style . Good for him
GOD BLESS HIM.
And he is cute 🥰 the woman who matry him will be a lucky one
Love him! ❤
Auntie wanna piece of that 😂😂😂
Why were they not talking Spanish to each other?
What a legend.
Based 👍👍
💪❤️
where can i find a story or article???
hopefully he invested all that money into an cool NFT
What a G
I guess returning things in America that don't belong to you it is a rare event.
Bad behavior is always up to the parents. Raise your kids right.
Thank you Adrian and Adrian's mom❤
Looks Mexican American ofc he was raised right
Awesome, he should be president
Everything you do comes back to you! Thank you
In Wisconsin. My mom lost her purse 5 years ago and had $525 in it and we never found it again. Was also at a hospital too.
The young man is a God sent. The roommate is an Idiot.
He smashed those ladies forsure
Lol man, he's just a good dude, don't get me wrong, it's something that should be highlighted, but a lot of people would do that for people, i've found purses and wallets before.
There is a darker possibility here but I don't want the leftists to have a fit so I trust you can figure it out yourselves
job well done bro
He looks like the thieft
Mom and Dad will be proud....I hope!?
Hats off to this young man & MOM!
it sucks that there is a reward for this. it should be normal to bring people their lost belongings.
Good guys rule ❤
Why don’t videos like this get 29m views 😂 some of my favorite songs have 29 million views and maybe two make me feel how this video made me feel
lol scammed
Good job kid.
$28,000 hermes bag... LOL
Nice video.....Who did all the editing  ..?
This is the present and the future San Diego ❤
This young man Iam so happy for he really has been taught how you would like to be treated. Happy he recieved a reward
I wish everyone was like this kid. There wouldn’t be any wars if it was the case.
top lad
Amazing young man
Good stuff
Real title:  Kid feels guilty for heisting purse and pretends to be the good samaritan by returning it.
Fake ''feel good'' stories. What women leaves their purse in a parking lot.
He seen that ID and face and was like hmmmm  🤔 ❤jk good stuff man
Wait, isn’t this just normal behavior? In Germany this would not lead to any News I‘m sorry
Good on him
His mom was probably in tears of happiness when she heard about this
The narrator's voice is awful 😱
As he should !;!
It’s just a normal thing to do. But in the world we live in it’s not self-explanatory to do such thing sadly.
Amen still some good people out there
Awesome young man!
We all know right from wrong it's making the right decision that is the challenge.
There’s no way this is news in the US 😂😂😂
👍👏
God Bless this young man and also his parents for raising him with good values❤.
Show this to trump
His mom should be proud she’s raising an honest young man!
What a decent young man from a decent family.  Society is a better place with people like him in it.
He is looking good 😮
Bravo Adrian. Stay true and stay strong young man 🖖👀
White people will never be this kind
Good kid from a good family!
its sad that this must be posted as a good deed instead of a normal act of kindness.
no wonder he returned it, i wouldve too 🥵😭
Good kid!
Thts awsome he needs a reward godbless all
Now he can buy a belt, so his pants don’t fall down.
A very well done young man,your mum should be very proud 👏
you know the US is in serious trouble when stuff like this ends up on news with 30 million views. This is nothing to be praised for really, 99% of people in some other countries would do the same
What a sweetie. He’s been raised right and will go far. ❤ Unfortunately by his looks, lots of people would classify him as a “thug” etc.
That’s a good dude right there. That’s the kind of person that deserves to be rewarded in life.
God bless ❤

Kid was raised right forsure. Props to his momma 🤙🏼
As a 15 year old in this generation, I was just beginning to lose hope. Props to this Hermano.
What a great young man!
He was just trying to get some buns
I know I'm a little late but that's an awesome young man
That one mini gta mission
sadly allot of peopel dont think that way.  just yesterday a guy before me at the bank machine was leaving in a hurry, when i got up to the screen he's account was still logged in and i could have taken everything. i pressed close, took the card out and ran after the dude, to give it to him and then got back in line at the machine.... Good deeds arent always rewarded...... 🤣
AROD🙌
🤍
What a bloody champ
Ofc he is a great guy but in some countries this is sort so a common sense. I guess it came as a surprise in America.
The news needs to be more like this
I would HATE to lose my valuables only for a scumbag to steal them. If I found someone's lost bag, purse, etc I'd do my best to return it to them. I'm proud of my honesty. It's horrible for them when they realise their loss, especially when it's gone completely, but wonderful when someone, like this guy, returns it to them!
Plot twist hes in jail for child molestation.  JK!!
Good job return girl purse
A beautiful young man!! May God be with him all the days of his life! 🙏
Bless him..Good guy.Good heart.Good Soul..❤
Nice.  This warms my heart and gives me faith in humanity.
That kid was raised right   Sagging 💀
This give me a goosebumps !!
props to the women as well who thought of even rewarding him. Respect all around 👏
Good knowledge from mom what a great kid
It’s not unreasonable that someone would return a lost item like that, say, to a police station… but to actually go out of your way to take it to the person themselves is so above and beyond.
Way to go, kid!
Someone I would like for my daughter to date!
Wonderful to see people who have a good heart✨❤️🙏🏼!. God's blessing to all✨❤️🙏🏼 respect 🙏🏼
Congrats to the mom! She brought him up well ❤
SMART! being a theif and doing selfish things never is worth it- you cheat yourself and others. this young man is a blessing and I'm sure he will go one to do more good in the world. Good foundation
My son is a good boy too
God bless them ❤
Awesome incredible young man!!!! ❤
I did it twice!!! Something you find anywhere and you know who belongs to is your job return it!! You will recibe blessings!
Many blessings coming his way!!
An honest guy,he’s well raised and good moral values.keep it up I’m rooting for a brighter future ahead.Shoutout to his family done a good job❤❤❤
Why didn’t you interview him?  He’s the main person!
The saddest thing about this story is the fact it's considered newsworthy. The young man is clearly a decent guy brought up properly, I hope his example inspires others to bring about a return to better days!
AWESOME KID!
Shout out to the news for covering good positive stories
Wow! What a kid. Praise to his parents.❤
There ain't no hope. Lol You ran into prbably the ONE with a good heart in that entire ZIP Code. 😂
In 1989 I went to a store to get candy for a friend "Rickys" Birthday Party I was riding my bike too soon after. I'm Italian, Friend Ricky was Hispanic. I'm standing in line at a store and the man in front of me drops cash as he pulled out his wallet from his back pocket. I grab the cash off the ground and tap the man on the shoulder. He doesn't speak English very well, but He got the idea. The man thanked me, gave me $5 which was a lot to a kid in the 80's and paid for my Stuff.   I ride my bike to "Ricky's" house for the Birthday Party. Ricky answers the door, and on the way to the backyard I see the guy. His Eye lit up and he smiles. And says something to Ricky. The guy at the store was Ricky's father.
Now this is what I’m talking about. This is awesome. There is still hope for some goodness.👍🏻
👍🏻💯👍🏻😎
Beautiful his parents must be so proud of him! Lovely young man ❤❤❤
He’s a hero for his generation and all of us 🎉❤
his mom raised a fine man
There is hope for us.
He's a great young man.
I love that this is being celebrated!!!!!🎉🎉🎉
Nice story. The “go fund me” at 1:35 took me out tho bless her heart 😂
what a legend
To all you trumpers that want to praise him, remember that your daddy wants to deport him, regardless if he was born here or not.
Daily encounter in Japan 😊
The behaviour of that young man should be normal. It's sad that it seems special to many people, the same who don't behave like him..
Very proud of this young man to do the right thing and to his wonderful mother to be the example he needed to learn compassion and to do what is rig always.
Definitely raised right incredible ❤
Integrity. Beautiful thing.
I don't undestand why this is such a big deal.  Most people would do this, well maybe not track a person down, but reach out somehow to let them know that their belongings were found.  Rewarding good behavior with cash doesn't send the best message.
❤
God Jesus bless this young man to keep the good deeds and always remember his mother’s teachings ❤🎉
Excellent. Some good need for a change
Good lad 🙏🇬🇧
We definitely need more people need more people in the world like him now a days
Excellent   He'll have a good future.   👍🇵🇬
So nice your family rewarded him for his kind heart and honesty.   I hope that young man finds happiness
I would to fine shyt😂
Way better than the high-speed pursuit videos I usually watch!
Great parenting,makes for  a great young man!!
We do have young beautiful people ❤❤❤
That's cool,   go boy!
I returned a purse with a lot of foreign money in it and got a "thank you."
Kid looks like a teenage Dominic Toretto and lady's house has a FAMILY artwork on the wall. So I guess Toretto does everything for the FAMILY. 😂😂
Central Cee?
Good kiddo ❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
faith in humanity restored
I did something similar but I stole all the money first.
In spite of my mostly negative feelings about the company as a whole, the YouTube algorithm does a great job of sneaking in those recommendations that give me so much hope for people as a whole. What a great story
He stole it and ”gave it back”
Okay they didn't give money to him they raised money on his behalf
Kudos for that honest young man! He DID the Right thing!
Never judge someone by their looks. This Foo earns Respect. Armor Carnal✊
Always be honest
He was raised right. Great work
Amén 🙏🏼🕊️
He's a good boy.
How did you loose your purse?
I’ve always believed that you treat people the way you want to be treated and this is a great example of that 👏🏻👏🏻
I returned an elderly woman's purse many years ago. She got my address and sent me $50 which at that time was a fortune for me. I used the money to buy a new pair of shoes that immediately relieved a life-long foot pain I had been suffering. As an elderly man now, I smile when I go for very long walks. I remember HER kindness.
What a great teenager! Goodness is around!
I found a neighbors wallet on the sidewalk and went over to return it. Never met him before. He asked me how I got it, I told him, and he said ‘sure you did’ and shut the door in my face.
I love good positive stories like this💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
It's a testament to the US society, that a simple dude bringing back a womans purse makes the news... This is, what everyone should just do and not asomething, that is special enough to warrent a news report.
....... Nice One !    👍
Mama did a damn good job 🫶🏻
Moms hot. Can you blame him hahaha 🤣
Did he tap ?
Cool
I found a purse on a bus years ago and took it home , showed it to my mum and the lady got it about a couple of hours later . Had to wait for my eldest brother with a car . I think my reward was $5 Australian .
There *is* hope.
I've done that before, not twenty miles. For some people in my apartment.
Tia bad asf I want her instead of the money 😅
Good job bruh!
Damn it a 3 some would’ve been nice lol just joking. Or I’m I hah😂😂
Wonderful young man.  Kudo's to his parents!
Dudes a g   A real Gentleman.
So proud of rhis boy
see that's why mom is always #1 she raise us well
That’s San Diego for you. I love it here.
Great kid! Mom should be very proud of her son.
I remember this story, kid did good. I hope he’s doing good today.
That’s awesome
Great job young Man Good gets Good
Found a different article from 2022 (same year) mentioning that they raised more than 17.000$. I wonder how high It got in the end. 😮
There is hope for this Earth!
He saw her photo and said “I’ll do it”
What a wonderful story
An outstanding job from everyone!
He probably could've smashed if he played his cards right
Not in any way to take away from this responsible honest young man but I’m confused as to why this has generated so many comments?  When did honesty and integrity and doing the right thing become so unusual? So profoundly unexpected that people feel the best way they can acknowledge this young man’s honesty is by giving him money? The outpouring of positivity is fantastic but did anyone ask him if he wanted this publicity, this attention? He might be completely fine with it, I know I certainly wouldn’t be, and while you can see from the post it was done from a place of gratitude …… did anyone ask?  Personal experience of this kind of situation, when I was a teenager working in McDonalds and a young couple left a bag in the restaurant which turned out to have every penny they’d been saving for months to buy everything for their expected baby that day.  Didn’t occur to me to do anything but hand it in to my manager or expect anything more than the relieved and utterly grateful smile on that young mums face when I gave her the bag back …. I was beyond well rewarded in that moment, never expected anything more and would have refused or given to charity if offered.
Class act. I hope he and his family thrive.
one in trillion
Esa es nuestra Raza, Love you Homito, Good Job, asi se hace!!!
A good kid
So happy that the women made the effort to find him.  He deserved a reward and got so much more. Glad this went viral as he is a good role model though people doing the right thing should not expect anything as the young man said...his intentions were pure.
Salute
his parents raised him correct
❤❤❤
His mother must be extremely proud...which she should be!!!😊🙏🏾💪🏾✊🏾👏🏾❤️
Good kid. Would be proud
Great guy, God bless him. Kudos to all who contributed to his reward.
Exact definition of integrity.
It's cool but it's sad that it is such an anomaly and treated as such
Joe Biden would have stuffed the loot into his pants packet
I love the look on his face when he rings the bell. He looks serene and open.
Love this!
The Legend told, the lady & that young-man dated after that under the radar.
Good man!! The world needs to follow you example
Great parenting! Great kid who followed great parenting! 🤩
Just shows the utmost importance of parental education, congrats Mom👏
This is so nice and heartwarming. Thank you for a great reminder to be kind and have integrity :')
❤🥹❤️
"Treat others how you would like to be treated" Most basic concept you can imagine and yet it's a miracle when you see it.
Praise God. Very rare.
woah refreshing positive news?  Going to check the weather channel in HE double Hockey Sticks to see if it froze over while I was sleeping
He looks like he's from 2005.
Stories like this is what gives me faith that there’s hope for humanity despite all the crazy stuff going on around us. A couple of years ago, my wife and I (btw we live in San Diego) went to BC, Canada. On our way to Whistler, we stopped at a McDs for brkfast, at a small town. Afterwards we drove around a little, then I had to use the bathroom. We found a public park that had a restroom. As we continued on our trip, I realized I don't have my phone. So we traced our moves backwards. I went to the public restroom and there was a note on the door about a phone found and a number to call. I called the number and went to the meeting place. It turned out to be a homeless shelter. The guy who found my phone lives there. I tried to offer him money but he wouldn't accept, so I gave it to the people running the place for their feeding program. I'll never forget this experience.
The kid probably stole it in the first place
Let's vote for him for the House of Representatives.
Great story and he earned that reward. What a top bloke he is.
My brother and I found a wallet when we were children too young to drive and it had the woman’s license and it along with I forgot what at least some credit cards and money, and we bicycled  a long way to return it because we were too young to drive and our dad wouldn’t take us so I think we bicycled 3 miles more each way and it was fairly hot and it was on a military base at the time, but the rules didn’t require to go through security because this was several decades ago       It was an older woman, and we were hoping to have a little money by it as a thanks but all she did was give us  a drink, and talk us to death. I think she was very lonely, but we were taught to do the right thing.
This is what I would do, no matter how much money was in it. I don't like dishonesty. When I find money I declare it! I know people who would keep the money, what goes around comes around.
When I was 17 I found an envelope with 3000 dollars in the bathroom at a department store in Atlanta. I turned it in to security and all my friends back at school said I was dumb to turn it in. But after a period of time, no one claimed it and they gave it to me. I felt good knowing I did the right thing and I was able to buy my first car with that money. 🙂
Media drives behavior.  More stories like this one makes for a better society.
Bro got 3k and a lifetime supply of poon. Good 4 u homie.
i return very expensive telephone not even 10 dolar my kids told me dont  when i lost my walet with money no one return it but i know haw it feel so i told them where i found it she didnt came for her frend came for caling it
Good man ❤
The act of righteousness he makes him a good man that he will be rewarded for long into his life. He will have a great life because of what he’s made of. Oh, his mother is admirable

Treat or Trick😂😂
“Always do the right thing, even when no one’s watching” and we have someone who’s running for president who flaunts the law and seems to go out of his way to do the wrong thing when EVERYONE’S watching.
If bro ever get caught in a case all he has to do is play this video and he off😂
how much for the bottha ya
Atta boy!
🙏🏻💝🌻
He's a man already.
❤❤
Finally some good news worth reporting why can't everyone report on this the whole time
They really should of came together and hooked him up
'Always do the right thing, even when nobody's watching.' A good lesson thaught by the mama of this honest youngster. 👍😘
Why would one woman have another woman's identification? Who carries around someone else's ID? that's weird.
It’s all about how you’re raised.   Has nothing to do with color or race or gender.   He was raised right and deserves the reward.    Well done young man!!
He thought she was hot, had to meet her in person
I once found a wallet on a street in Chicago! It was at a time when there still telephone directories. I found here name, called her and gave her my address. One after noon, she buzzed my building and announced it was her. Inst3ad of waiting for the elevator --i lived on the 2nd floor--  i took the stairs to go down and on my way down i met a stranger. He turned out to be a policeman. The wallet's owne4 was there in the lobby, the policemen asked her if i was the mugger.  . It was a hard lesson learned.....she never apologized, nor thank me for trying to help her. Neither did the police.
1 example of good karma
The fact she wasn’t gunna give him money originally
Love these stories with good deeds so uplifting and we need it in this world
And many that see him on the streets would probably judge him by the way hes dressed
“Theres hope for our younger generation”  She spoke too soon, 2024 is the worst year known to man.
I hope there is hope in this hopeless world.
Good job 👏
1 in a million
He was raised the correct way
Good job, young man. You should be proud and your parents should take pride in your actions.
I returned a purse to a lady that lived around d the corner from me about 45 years ago. I was about 10 yo. She took it and slamed the door on me 😳. Shame on her
2 cougarssss
Mom raised this young man right
One time when I was 15 I found a wallet and stupidly decided it was better to take the cash rather than try and find the owner. Still to this day I regret it, bypassing basic human morales and ethics for a measly $20. I hope that person is living a good life, I repent for this sin.
Good deeds done for him. Awesome. Must have been raised well by his parents
If you can't find a good person in the world, be that person.
So nice
That brought tears of joy to my heart ❤️ you very rarely see this.God bless him
Great young man. Mom and dad you raised him right. God bless him.
His mom should be proud!
This is so cool!!!...he better pay his mother by taking her out to a nice dinner❤❤🎉
Plot twist: He was the one who stole it in first place 💀
I was standing in line at the self checkout at Walmart…it was my turn next I walked up..looked down and seen a bunch of bills still in the change return …I yelled to the man leaving and gave it to him. He thanked me. I hope something that small will make other do the same
Very nice story it gives you hope🥲
He probably tried to take her money but she had nothing in the bank account.
Honesty is a reward by itself.
I did that this year and they would not even open the door but called a neighbor and they ran me down to take,but not before being rude and treating me like I did something wrong like him I expected no reward just a thanks basically some people do not know how respect a good deed
Question asked: Why did he go out of his way to return the purse? Answer: his family raised him right.  Solid work man, if you were my son, I would be proud.
Love this
They should have interviewed the kid. What a remarkable human being
Yup always do the right thing even when no one is watching that’s what it’s about great young man ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Rare deed in California!
Still 🫡
There some great people in this world 🌎 🙏🏾
It's shocking that this is considered abnormal
This is awesome good job humanity
What if there was 20,000 dollars in the purse and his mum was in dept with rent for over 10,000 dollars and he had to pay 10,000 dollars for his university fees ! And another one of his family had medical bills to save there life !
Humanity has sunken deep if this is news...
Did he complete the good dead by giving the 3k to charity
Love this story. Great young man
Nothing worth stealing in the purse so might as well return it for a reward maybe. That was the thinking
Love to see this young man get amazing opportunities offered to him.❤❤❤❤
Adriannnnn! ❤❤❤🎉
Dunno why this is in my feed years later, but this was cool to see. Good guy.
❤ Awesome young man of integrity
Damn right ! Says alot about him and his parents > what a great story
God Bless that young man
Brung up proper
dude was tryna get in that 🐱
Not every teen is a criminal. Donald J Trump😮
WOW, I'm bloody shocked, but good on ya boy!!!❤
Give me a break.
I lost my phone on a bus last May and when the guy who found it answered, he told me to come to his address to get it.  Opened the door and we couldnt believe it.  He was the one guy who ive ever had a physical fight with as an adult outside a bar like 5 years prior.  It was the oddest meeting but i still gave him a 20 i had in my wallet we shook and departed.  It was the oddest chance reunion i have ever even heard of.
Karma is beautiful.✨
Good kid❤
Still hope for our children!
HOLY MELONS.
❤❤❤❤❤
Thank you!  What a great story.❤
This should be normal not exceptional.
Great young man 🎉🎉i❤
Flipped cap, chains, tattoos. Never. NEVER judge a book by its cover.
Damn shes a cougar
Good stuff.
All of us is the power to change the world
Good parenting and good kid
Gotta love America and all its great Americans!!!!!  Kudos to this wonderful young man and his parents!!!!!!
Dang so he got 3,700 blocks 😂
300000+ Aura
There is no hope Gen Z is screwed
If she didnt update her address with in 10 days of moving, she can get in trouble...
I agree… Hats off to his parents… What a great job… I had three sons and I have told him the same thing… Wrongdoing only bites you in the end… Look at this kid and how he was rewarded gratefully at the end… Good job, my man!!!
3k is a little much.
I'd have to ask for a date from the Cougar. Lol
I lived the first half of my life in a NYC area ghetto and I've never had any problems in the streets nor with the law. My parents were very strict.
My very humble recommendation is not to make a habit of giving rewards. Just say thank you. If it was a real action, wonderful, it restores our confidence in humanity, but if not, many people might take things without permission and pretend they have found them and return them for a profit.
Gives me hope for this world great guy
With the last name like Rodriguez, you wouldn't think! 😂 Hats off to momma for raising a real man. Good job
Fake
need more kids like this, he has a great start or could buy him something with this
🙏🤍✨🙏🤍✨🙏🤍✨
He looks firm on his decision in this vid. Further proves he has strong character
Bro got free rizz 💀
This kind of karma is worth rewarding!!!  Great kid!
Much respect!!!!
Funny. I found a pair of socks at the beach last night.  One sock had $3 in it. Saw some people camping with little kids. $3 was a lot of money when I was a kid. A lot to this kid. Gave it to them. I’m 71. Mom raised me right. Lol
My father always told me to do your acts of kindness when no one is watching. Later in life a employee of his  ( he owned a plumbing business) told me my dad gave him  20 grand to send his kid to private highschool and my father told the guy to not tell his son it was him paying. My father wanted the kid to think it was his father who payed. My father never told anyone about this. I had to find out from the source. Thats why i cant stand these youtube videos people just have to record themselves giving a salad to a homeless person and post it on their Instagram like  "look at me!! Look at how good of a human being i am"
It feels so much better to do good than to do bad
Adrian is a coming man. Well done, Adrian!
He’s cute
Great honest young man…rare these days ❤
This is the kind of person that should be the Prime Minister, president or a leader of industry some day.
But has he received that money ? Just wondering.
So cute how he pulls his pants up, as if it matters. But he wants to be respectful. I wish him the best life.
scripted for views😂
Reminds me of GTA 5
A go fund me for a good act? Omg what have we come to?
I don't know but people doing good deeds makes me see them 10x more good-looking.
kind foo
Hey saw the license photo and wanted to check it out
He returned the woman purse. She gave him. 3,000 that's a nice gesture to the young man by the lady who lost her purse..
He smashed
Im i thr only one who thinks this looks fake ,
That's awesome
It is so sad that society reacts so chocked when someone performs an act of kindness. THIS IS HOW WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BEHAVE......Non the less 2 thumbs up to this young man.
he look like central cee too 😂
Based.
He seen a hot latina on the ID and decided what was more important 😆 🤣
He seen the woman was a dime and said he gotta pull up
This is the way
Kindness is everything.
All i can say to all involved is………❤️😊
What a rotten, unthankfull woman! Thanks to the well mannerd friend.
Great story.
This is sweet this child is on the right path ❤
❤
Maybe he’s just a good person? Why do people give all of the credit to his parents..?
This warms my heart
Kid look identically like the woman speaking gtfoh anything for clout i tell you
Respect 👍👍
He saw the pic on the license 😜😉
If I owned a business and needed to hire some help, this kid would be at the top of the list!
The young people they give me hope .god bless america
Sometimes this kind of attention is not a good thing.  Every gang-banger in town will be looking for this kid and his money.
Him for president.
I would hire him.
Man and when I give back a lost time to someone all I get is a thank you 😂
A hug would have been enough.
he only did it cause he saw her id and thought he would bag her
Atta go young man !  Good for you being such a gentleman.
Good kid
That normally doesn't happen. Keep the money and toss the person next time LOL
So proud of him! He did the right thing and I hope all kids were like this!
A real gentleman right here, speaks volumes of his character👍
His mom taught him well. He will grow up to have good karma throughout his whole life. God bless him and his family 🙏🏽🌈☀️❤️
What's cool is a bunch of the kids who saw this and listened to this story might stick their chest out and look for good things to do whenever they can get the chance to  👍
He only returned it to get a reward
"A Boy’s Good Deed Takes a Dark Turn, Ending in Arrest"   What began as a feel-good story of teenage kindness has taken a surprising and tragic twist. A 17-year-old boy gained internet fame after returning a lost bag he found at a mall to its owner, an act that was captured on a home security camera and widely shared on social media. Inspired by his honesty, thousands of people donated to him, raising $19,000. But the boy’s newfound fame took a sinister turn. Instead of using the funds for good, he funneled the money into building a criminal network involved in drugs and prostitution. The dark transformation came to light when authorities arrested him, exposing how an act of kindness spiraled into a life of crime.
Stage
She looks… familiar 😂
Nice to see that there is still hope for humanity.
It was probably nun in the purse
My friend found a wallet in a parking lot with several hundred dollars. Temptation kicked in. He said that  he saw a picture of the woman and her  beautiful kids and he felt bad . He said she might be a single  mother because he saw no pics of a man. So he returned it . However, I don’t know if the way he returned it was the smartest way. He took it to the manager of the store. He said 2 black dudes cursed him out and almost kicked his ass because he returned the money. He explained it was a black womans money and they just kept calling him stupid. They were probably upset because they didn’t find the money.
1 IN 1.000.000. U GET A REWARD. i once brought a wallet back. Guy opens his door in his underpants. Gets mad at me for waking him up from the night shift. Sees his wallet. Grabs it and closed the door.
my mom walked by and say the kid and said "he seems like a thug" and I showed her the video and she hasn't talked to me for the rest of the night and then apologized for like an hour😂
I wish everyone had such good morals and principles.
Huge kudos to the parents
That's a boy who was raised right!
Lord God protect this young man 🙏🏾
That DL pic was pretty he thought he had a chance 😂❤
How did she not know that she had left her purse behind?
I cough alot from weed
So, We had a company come paint our office at work mostly during after hours. I come into work one day and go to use our restroom and i immediately see a wallet right in the center of the floor.  I was first to use the bathroom that morning,  and so naturally I pick up the wallet and called my manager right away, who happened to be off that day.  She did not answer,  I'm thinking i would be in a panic if i lost my wallet. The wallet snaps together like a book, so so i opened it, NEVER went through it but i could clearly see multiple 100 dollar bills, drivers ID, social security card, credit cards.... It belonged to one of the painters.   My manager finally calls back and I inform her,  she reaches to the guy to let him know.    Well instead of being grateful he was FURIOUS  that it was opened.   I was NEVER thanked, infact i was called into my managers office to be "talked to"  I obviously didn't take anything,  didn't write down any important info, Heck i forgot his name just an hour later...  How else where we suppose to identify the owner?  Xray vision? Just glad some people appreciate honest people,  because that almost never made me want to help a stranger again. Seriously,  how can i be reprimanded for doing what i thought was a good deed.  Just awful....
He went to go check out the chick 😂😂
I remember around 12 years ago in Belfast I found a wallet which had over £1000 in it. Gold cards, bank cards and golf membership cards etc. Then I seen a man get out of his big flashy car and look about as if he had lost something. I asked if he’d lost something then he said his wallet and described it to me.  I gave him it back. He said thanks then said I’ll have to reward you!!!  The miserable sod gave me £5 out of over the £1000 he had in it!
"returns" everyone is so dumb 😂😂
Doing what is right even when noone is watching. I tell my kids the exact same thing. INTEGRITY.
Mijo ,eres un ejemplo a seguir,las personas que te educaron ,icieron un excelente trabajo contigo,te encenaron valores ,bendiciones para ti,nunca cambies.
One of the few good men in this wicked generation. God is pleased.
How tf did he no where to go
He might look gangsta, but Mother's saying stays in him all the time. Great kid!
That young man will have a very bright future in his life. Companies will definitely want to employ him for his honesty.
Jesus love’s you very much god bless you Amen.
Gofundme seems unnecessary
example of great parenting . Bravo to his parents 👏
So they kept the 758 dollars remaining 😂😂
“There’s hope for our generation “ 🙃 I really hope so. Kudos
Purse returned but wallet had no money in it
God bless you young man!
Good man-'don't judge a book.....' is really applicable here.
What a great story
He’s an angel. My cousin did the same thing on a hidden camera show in Cali! I was so proud of him.
i hope he will not become a politician
Dating one of their daughters will be an automatic approval too lol
This was wholesome
I would’ve kept it
That’s a good boy . Bless him .
Exactly, the golden rule! That is the only law we need.
Good man 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼 respect
sweet,God bless him.
It's sad that this is the exception,  not the rule,  by folks these days. But when acts of Goodness and Honesty DO take place... it does restore a little faith in this world. Just like ur momma taught you,  do the right thing when nobody is watching,   Well done young man!👏👏👏
Encourage Doing The Right Thing I Always Reward & or 💁 Acknowledge a Good Deed 🙂 That Gives Hope To Everyone*
1. Raised Right  (Good start.)  2. Listening & Understanding the good upbringing is next important step.  3. Executing how you were raised & performing the good up bringing after understanding that virtues you’ve learned is final ste.
Great job young man!!!! You made your mom and all moms proud!!!!
This is a true G
Bless this kid
SO happy he recieved a reward WELL EARNED! Even tho he was humbled by returning it....am sure the lesson being shared on social media is an extra plus for EVERYone.
Always like to hear something like this. Living with integrity is tough, so even acting with integrity when you can really says a lot.
Ganji churiya wyd here??
What a nice guy - and attractive, too!
❤❤❤❤❤
I did that once, only to be accused of stealing it.🙄
❤
it's very easy  just think about karma, do good things, you'll get paid
It's nice to get a good story every now and again.
God bless him 🙏
That's called integrity! Good for you young man!
I know this is 2 years old, and I'm sure everyone already knows that this was a SCAM !! The girl on the left is the mother of that boy !! It was all planned, the Go Fund Me, everything !! Come on, guys, it's 2024. Stop being so fricken naive !!
That is what any decent person would do.
If it was California it might be hope for him 😂😂😂😂😂
Young man❤❤❤❤ I am so proud of you! Your Mom raised you right! I’d say you also have God in your heart…and wouldn’t want to disappoint HIM!
What an awesome young man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is very rare.Ive lost my wallet with my driver's license and a bunch of credit add cards and some cash in it. I retraced my steps and I had lost it in the parking lot at a gas station. If the person wanted to give it back they could have just mailed it to the address but it was to never be seen again😮
Lmao Ik for a fact he returned that perse bc he thought the ID was an attractive lady.  And if it was a dudes wallet ten adios.  Bro was tryna make moves and ended up making 3k instead which is way better. Good for him. Bro got lucky is what he got. It’s all about circumstances and opportunities.  You have to be on the lookout and act.
what a good boy
My dad once did the same and i gave him the ride to return a wallet
❤ god bless him
how hard is to know people like this young man, doing the right thing. God Bless him.
I would like to donate to his GoFundMe, but I can’t find it
I would like to donate to his GoFundMe, but I can’t find it
Guy got bricked up seeing her license photo
His parents should be very proud
Salute mr teen-ager! Bravo!👏👏👏
He's lucky the cops didn't arrest him for having it. Good job Lad.
I did the same thing when I was younger and found a lady wallet with her license showing so I returned it to the address. She opened the door looked inside and saw all her important information was in it and her money. I never opened it so I didn’t know what was inside. She smiled closed the door. I was just happy to return it.  My friend found $900 in an envelope while she was working and the lady came back and inquired about the envelope so my friend gave it to her and the lady didn’t say Thank You It’s good to do the right thing no matter what❣️
I did that in LA. The white guy was so rude to me, after I went out of my way to return his check I found on the floor. How I really wished I had tear up his check.   A black guy just can’t win.
Gotta be careful with saying things like he was "raised right" because it invites an enormous crowd of people who hate their parents who think parents have no positive impact on kids and that it's entirely up to them to decide to be good people because they didn't have good parents and literally have no conception of what being raised properly actually means.
Good job Mom and great job young man. That made me feel so good.
🙏
Parents raised him rwite.
I wouldn’t come out in the open.
hi can i ask for help $2,500
A good gentleman.
That's a 17 year old MAN
YAY MOM (he only mentioned he got the training from his mother so I’m only mentioning her as well)
where he at now cs he foiiiine
This isn't news in Canada
husband speaking age 81.8  I worked for the U.S. Postoffice for 35 years.  You would not believe how many lost or stolen purses or wallets end up in the drop box of the Post Office.  Get rid of the evidence - drop in the mail.  We ( Post Office ) will try to return the item to the ADDRESS ON THE DRIVERS LICENSE, which is usually WRONG.  If you move and do not want to go to the DMV to change your address, at least write a new address on a piece of paper and tape to your license.
We need more people like BOTH OF THEM! so many times good deeds go unnoticed and even punished in this unfair world. Good to see some people still reward good behavior!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
We need More people like him and I need more friends like them women...👍🏻
Good job to the teenager 👏🏻
🥰
sweeeeet boy💋 ❤❤❤❤💰💰💰💰
I found a ladies purse at Walmart. I returned it. 2 weeks later my wife left her purse in the shopping cart. It got returned. Karma is real people!
Raised right! By a family who loves him, who doesn’t teach him hate. He’s not white, rich republican trash.
I know how you could really thank him.😂🎉
Great And Beautiful Deeds !  Never go unawarded  !! Thank you for sharing with us !!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thats awesome. Good man!
"Californian kid" there's no way 😂.
He just wanted to case the house😂
I think I would've just asked for some...you know what never mind 😂
Bien orgulloso de mi raza❤💪🏽🙏🏽
He did this because he was hoping it would blow up like this and he'd make money out of it see everyone has an ulterior motive 😂
Young man with integrity a rare breed!
Good bean!
Thats a good young man.   His mom is doing something right
I was once given $80 for returning a woman's credit card. I tried to find her on Facebook and luckily I did and she came and picked up her card and I was not expecting that $80 and I was homeless and it really helped a lot.
I was so depressed watching all the videos on YouTube about how far our society has degraded. Then I came across this clip. So commendable what he did. Kudos to that young man.  "You're never wrong for doing the right thing".
Outstanding young man. He will have a handsome reward for his honesty.
“There’s hope for our younger generation”  Although I do believe that a variation of that phrase has been said by most older folks in regard to the younger generations. I can’t be the only one who finds this comment to be very condescending.
I doubt he touched any of that money
does he also do this for addresses in the poorest part of the city? or only the wealthiest?
plot twist: he stole the purse and felt bad about it.  but all jokes aside kudos to him he was raised right.
He was.
It's too bad stories like this aren't as highly viral as others.  Way to go everyone involved here 👍🏼
I was playing basketball at a park onetime and forgot my wallet overnight and it had $300, my social security, debit card, and gift cards. (I was 16 and dumb idk why I carried my social) the next day I got a call from the police department saying some lady turned it in and everything was still in it. I never even knew who she was.
When I was a teenager I seen a purse that was left in a shopping cart outside of Walmart. I took it to the front desk of the store so that no one would steal it 🙂...
Awesome young man.  Your mother should be proud, I know I would.
Not gonna lie bro definitely looked threw it just to see if it had good shi so that why he brought it back
Nothing surprise if you live in Japan. I lost my wallet twice but they all returned without losing anything. Friends say the same thing.
How you forget a whole purse.
That is so sweet.
Plot twist he wrote down their credit card and account numbers to use at another time as to not arise suspicion 😂.  Kiddddinggg good to see someone do the right thing.
Good kid
I went out of my way once to drop off a package that was misdelivered to me. I just wrote a note so they would know and left it at their doorstep
Wow 😮.....😊😊😊😊😊😊
Good lad.
I returned a wallet and was only given $100 lol
Thats a nice family. And a blessed man.
As a father it's good to know there's still some kids being raised right
I can’t believe she opened the door. Stupid
❤❤❤❤❤👌🏻
Oooo … Audi ❤
👍
White Cardi B 😍
Warms my heart. Thank you young man.
We need more people like him
Good parenting on his mom’s part and he does have a good heart.
He did a good deed but 3K is a little rediculous
That boy was raided right, he’s got a good mama!
Truly happy for that young man and he was raised up good your parents should be proud of you truly
I have purse
I wish we can see more of this and post it! I know it can make a difference
Good kid. I hope it continues with this generation of kids.
Good guy ❤🎉
Truly dark times where just being an honest person makes it to the news.
Good for him. But how can you FORGET the most important ?? Just don't get it.
Moms might be military. i heard this alot while i was in
If it was $50,000 in purce different results 😅😅
Amazing story ❤❤❤
I heard many things  but not a thankyou😢
Now this is how all young boys should be.  Wtg kid.
👏👏👏   👜  💸   😊 wonderful 😊
The sad thing is, this is how people should behave, we shouldn’t be surprised at his actions.
🤗❤
What a sweetheart!!!😊😊😊
“Always do the right thing, even when no one is watching,” Awesome mom who raised an AWESOME son! 👍👍❤
taking a reward for doing the right thing makes it all go down the drain! I will never understand how or why people will accept money for what didn't belong to them anyway. Having moral and integrity is a reward!
Eliana Martin make the boy a man lol
That’s the kinda person you want working for you
There's a good kid raised by great parents...doing the right thing!!
He Comes From Good Stock!
Good kid
Do the right thing"Even when nobody's Looking"...Words to live by.
I hate when they say there’s hope for our young generation. Every generation has good people and worthless people in it
Fun fact: if you find someone's ID you can drop it in a USPS dropbox and they will return it to the owner.
Thank God !!!!  🙏🙏🙏🙏 There is still Good people in this world  🌍👏👏👏👏  🇺🇸
Mom  raised him  right  good  man
Great but i hate my mind too
Hallelujah there's hope for teens in 2024
Love this so much ❤❤❤
I lost my wallet with cash and gift cards and all my personal info never found it again even though I lost it at my job….
Even if he looks like a gangster “never judge a book by its cover”
Amazing
He wasn’t expecting a reward and we shouldn’t do good deeds because we want something in return.  He did the right thing but so sweet of those folks to reward him.  Excellent
❤Go on Son!!! What a belta👌🏻👆🏻🙌🏻💯😎
👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👏👏👏💖💖💖
same values that islam teaches, he might be a good muslim in the future, i do believe, may allah guide him to islam 🤲
I hope he actually gets the GoFundMe $, too many scammers on go fund me just pocket the money
THAT'S AWESOME 💯😎
It's sad that this is so uncommon now that it is news worthy.
Well look at his car and jewelry I don't think he needed it anybody else notice that
The question is tho…did he get the money they raised on his behalf…
Best
What a nice man! He deserves this!
That’s a well raised young man out generation need to be like that❤✊🏿💯
Awesome job young man, stay on the path of doing the right thing. It will not be easy, but it will be most rewarding! I am proud to say I watched this video, excellent job!
Gentleman.
This is Gods plan for us! Godspeed! Do the right thing alway!
Beast mode!!!
Good dude man
Now if only white kids would do the same
He was looking to get some gash
The kid accepted the reward? 😂 us British kids say no it’s ok. Just doing the right thing   Learn
The fact this is even newsworthy shows how far we’ve fallen as a society
Auntie lokking fire
It’s the guy from that one 2000s ad
Few years ago I was driving home from work and when approaching a red light the passenger in an industrial work truck in front of me got out and climbed this ladder into the back and then climbed out to get back in the truck before the light turned. As he was getting climbing in I saw his phone fall right out of his back pocket, and he didnt notice. Even when he climbed out.  So I followed him about a mile down the road to a roundabout to see which way he was going to turn, I then turned around to see if his phone was not only still there but hopefully undamaged by other vehicles that could have it over. To my suprise, his phone was still where it fell and completely fine! I then drove back down to the roundabout and turned where I last saw him turn, as I turned they were coming down the street, (probably going back to find his phone) I honked my horn waving his phone out the window to get their attention.  He was so grateful I retrieved his phone and sought him out to return it. 😊
Maybe there’s hope for humanity
just goes to show u can NEVER judge a book by its cover 😊
Awesome
I lost my wallet a while ago with all my work ids and license and 300$ left it on back bumper of truck drove off still hoping one day i might get my ids
so the keys he got didnt worked in the night befor?
Never judge a book by its cover, eh?
Is amazing to see a kid this generation raised with such great morals.  That speaks highly of him and his mom! Kuddos! ❤
What a great guy. Don't hear of this very often but fantastic when we do. Your mother is a wise woman and so proud of your good deed
The IRONY is, in messed up America 98 percent of kids would never hand someone's wallet back in. But in opposite Australia at least 70 percent of kids would hand a wallet back in. So ANOTHER good deed that is considered a MIRACLE in America is quite common place in Australia 😂
The way they’re surprised he’s not a thug. 😂
The pure definition of integrity is doing the right thing, even though no one is watching or would ever know. His parents should be very proud 👏.
“There’s hope for our younger generation”  Me: 🗿🔥🔥
He cute too, he bta have some ladiessss.
This isnt that unheard of.  More times than not people do the right thing
Aw man, I love stories like this and good on them for giving that kid a bunch of money. Now he can buy some more bling
Mashallah hes a good boy ❤
A very honest young man. God Bless his Heart.
Need more parents like jim more kids like him good stuff
We thank God, there is hope!🙌🏿
What a lovely young man!
This guy will get a job in the bank for sure
Now thats gangsta!
Good lad. Well done mate.
I love hearing stories like this ❤.  Thank you young man, may others learn that it's always more rewarding to do the right thing, than not.   (Also not refering to $ as what's most rewarding, but ahhh... INSIDE EDITION, that's almost 4k, not 3! Dang!)
Good on you young man !
That's awesome
Way to go Young Man! ✌🏿 God Bless You!
🏆🐐🏆
The best part is, this will solidify to him that doing the right deeds for the right reason will always have amazing unexpected returns
Now that a great man in the making.
Evil language, blasphemy.
He's a good young man. He'll make a great husband.
so lost driver license is the end of the world in USA? wtf here in Europe just go to take new one for 50€
Well done young fella 🙌🥰❤
Great job Mom and son❤🙏🏾
I am so proud of how he responded and kudos to his mother for raising him with  honesty and respect for others! 💯👍👌👏❤️💯
That's a real man there boys. Above average for sure.
That lady on the right is a dime!
What a gentleman and a real dude
He definitely has a struggling mother not all kids will bring it back
He looks like someone from my school
My boy is fineee
That is good citizen right there... Good job little gentleman.
My dude🌄🤜🤛🤙
Twenty years ago this wouldn't even be news. Welcome to peak humanity.
We need more young men with moral values like this.
The cover isn’t everything…
This is EXACTLY how good deeds should be done, not for likes, clicks, and views on Social Media but just like this young man did. EXCELLENT JOB, YOUNG MAN!
That boy is a good American, not a Democrat.
Eminem?
"My mom told me to do the right thing even when no one is looking"... that's the definition of integrity. He has great integrity and that fact that he attributes that to his mom is just the icing on the cake.
He’s a really good dude. He deserves it. Hats off to him and his parents for raising him the right way.
Let him clap
Ended up being about 17k
That's me. I have return phones, wallets, etcetera and have also got my cellular phone back  twice.
I did the same at the age of 8. Although the purse (of my teacher) contained nothing, but I felt I should return it to its rightful owner.
Eyyyyy yoooo what a good thing to do!!!
He did it because of the picture on the ID
This is what everyone should do in this situation. Good thing he was raised right and has good morals 👏👏👏
This is a honest kid!  Good news we still have such a good young man in this world
That’s nice. When I did it, I barely got a grunt.
Awesome 👍👍 young man
Whatever good you put into the world will find its way back to you.
Aaaaaw how nice of him to return the purse he stole. 😌
Ok. He deserves free college tuition.   What a good guy.
I have had things returned various times over the years, and returned many things.  It is a great thing to do❤
Restores my faith in mankind- good job buddy!
He did what God says to do … he is a serious asset to society 🥰
Now that’s a good kid. Please stay like that bro.
A nice story!! What a welcome change.
At work someone either stole or threw away my favorite water bottle at work and this dudes returning a whole purse.
He such an Amazing boy 🤍
So they raised money to give to him lol he ain’t find one of ya social media pocketbooks Ctfu sike nah 😂😂😂😂
Your mother must be so proud of you. I wish you health and happiness all the days of your life. 🫶🏻🩷
Need more kids like this
but did he every got the money?
That is a good young boy raised by a responsible parents.
He saw her ID and noticed she was a MILF. Bro was probly so let down when he met that old lady 😂
Great kid god bless
Good job❤😍🥰😘
Anyone know who thos kid id... I wanna offer him a job ...
Eliana is fine as hell.
This is good news and am very proud of this young man. I am also glad that he received a reward for his act of kindness.
Good kid
Good karma bro❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Same thing happened to me. I went back to the store and no one had seen it. I went the entire weekend and went back and a lady had found it that night but she locked it up before she left her shift and forgot to tell anyone. I had over 600 in there and offered the money to her as a reward and she just told me to pay it forward. ❤️❤️❤️
Why would she film it and put it out on the internet, the guy brought her bag back he prob doesnt want a video of him with emotional porn out on the internet, then the comments about him being the next jesus, its to cringe for any stable honest man to deal with
Good man
Plot twist: when the kid rang the doorbell and saw it was a ring camera, he went from home invasion to feel good story
you know the world is in terrible state when a "good action" is so rare that people even reward him. I mean it should be a normal way of living life but apparently the world is overtrowned by evil acts
I find it funny how boomers think our generation is so screwed that us being kind welcoming individuals is something unexpected.
Good job mom for raising a fine young man.
Aww that sweet of him finding her purse im so happy for him and her
Strange that doing the right thing is newsworthy nowadays…
melina martez? playdate?
Always the 17 year olds
I return stuff i find all the time. Wheres my reward? Lol.
Fine young man?????? Unmmmmmmm that’s not creepy at all 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I downloaded this video and watch it every time I lose hope in humanity.
teenager with a brand new Audi, bro didnt need that purse at all.
So yall just going to IGNORE the fact that this UNGRATEFUL woman didnt even bother to take his name, give him a gift card or anything? Her friend had to twist her arm to do the right thing.
I’d like to think I’d do the same thing. Doesn’t it feel much better to make someone happy like that than steal their stuff?
Superbe personne 👍
Very rare now days!!!! Good job bro!!!!
I once lost my wallet, the dude called my library and they called me and gave me his address to pick it up
I returned a lost purse and the lady was thankful and said I was getting a reward instead The Cops show up with her in the car she Never thanked me in person Never gotbout tue car and i Never got a reward instead cops interrogated me then let me go realizing i was just being a good Samaritan and i still didn't get a reward.
Good deed yes but in all honesty he looks like the type that would have some 20-30 OTHER PURSES and only returned one. 😂 Also thank God the owner of the purse was really attractive. That would get a teen boy run to find your house STAT!
Good young man right there, 🙏🏽 I tell my kids the same thing about doing the right thing. And i live by doing for others what you would want to have happen to you. GOD bless you young man.
🙏🏾GOD WILL BLESS THIS BROTHA.... KARMA IS REAL... THE SEED YOU PLANT 🌱 IS THE SEED YOU HARVEST 💯
Need more angels like this homie good looking out bro
Could’ve got some cheeks as a reward
Such a good young man!! His mother should be extremely proud 🙂
Probably couldn’t spend any of the cards so he figured he might’ve got something if he returned it 🤣
Unfortunately, many good deeds will have you punished instead of rewarded
I bet he has a good mom
Good Deeds should be rewarded. It reinforces doing a good deed. I've done many good deeds in my day, because it's the right thing to do. However honestly I do regret a couple of them.
Good job at being solid young man! That's the real definition of standing on business!
Big dog great job @ being a great human!
Imagine if this whole thing was staged for the GoFundMe
Good young man
Top man
Should’ve said keep the $3k let me get the phone # 😂
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Returned a wallet (🇦🇺) to someone’s house. Didn’t even get a thank you. That’s aussies.
A positive story.What we all need with all the negativity that surrounds us.
I’d settle for some of that coot
Yes, he has a really good upbringing. But the reason is not at all what many people think. It is 50% plus genetic. The other part is the coincidence of where and who you grow up with.
Skit 😂😂
His mom raised him right. Kudos to her.  But BIG BIG kudos to him for taking her lessons in.  What a great guy! Karma is real and I  believe what you put out into the world will come back to you.  God bless him.
What is not yours, is not yours. So don't take it. It is as simple as that.
well done young man, well done, the world is proud of u and u deserve it
God bless this young man
La chancla did a good job.
Returning a lost belonging is like free gambling. You don't know how much you'll get in return. Sometimes you could get a human, like i did. I saved a girl from an abductor, and returned her to her father. Now she's my wife.
He got himself an a few pounds with that bread lol
Let the man speak for himself
Sadly that kid won’t make it far in life if he’s that honest.
Anyone knows of any lost purses that I can return? Pocket’s been tight lately
These ladys could of have him more than a 20 lol
This will come back 100 times for this young man great job mom and dad
But if it was a wallettt???
Hey, some people would like to be anonymous, you can't just post a video of someone like that. smh
Definitely not a trump supporter lol. They would have traded the purse for $8 worth of meth
My dogs go nuts when they hear the ring chime in this video
So shines a good deed in a weary world - William Shakespeare
Da sagen alle die Amis haben keinen Anstand ...
Why tf is this news
1:06 definition of Integrity
Imagine this same kid but without a great upbringing from his parents.  "If it was my stuff, I would want it to be returned so..." <-- exactly. Treat others how you want to be treated. No bible required for morals.
He watched a dhar mann video and got the inspiration
He's a genius criminal.  If there's no cash in the purse, he returns it to her, gets reward for good deed.
Nice kid, great job young man
I lost my wallet in a random cab and noticed almost immediately and was really hurt but thought it'd never get returned. That night, my boyfriend got a Facebook message from some guy saying he has my wallet. I had like over $100 and important stuff in there but everything was exactly how I left it. Couldn't really afford to pay him with more than $50, but I'm so glad there's people out there like this.
first 2 mins of a bad pron movie
Top tier guy and parenting! 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
This is great, good on the kid. But crazy to think about what this says about society. You return a lost purse and you're applauded as a hero and role model to the community. Shouldn't we all be doing this if we're normal people? Why do we expect everything to be stolen, broken into, robbed and burglarized and then breathe a sigh of relief when it's not? Tough world we live in.
Good man. He is already contributing to make this world a better place at such a young age.
Hey I did something similar recently but it was a lady’s bus pass it feels nice to do the right thing
Jesus loves yall :DDDD
he ain't a man, he the Man🗣🗣
That's so uplifting  God bless you young man
imagine their in on the scam
He was trying to smash lol
Never see people like that these days
Good job ❤
Shiid…..I would have kept that purse and everything in it. 😂
Every generation when thej get old ( there is hope for the young generation ) or Everything was better before😂😂😂
That kid is so kind
This boy's mom is the real hero.. she instilled morals into her son. So lovely to see.
"My mom told me since I was little to do the right thing even if no one is watching." That's freaking fantastic kiddo, you deserve that reward even if you didn't expect it. Mom deserves a reward too.
His life would be very difficult... World is most of time very cruel to such people.
Never judge a book by its cover
Son you're going to be all right in life your mom is a beautiful woman the way she raised you
Real foos from LA, with great parents right there. Dont steal, be loyal and family always.
It's too bad a lot of parents don't know how to raise their children. This kid has a good head on his shoulder.
I’ll do the same thing if someone said that to me, (I’m Mexican too)
Good kid
God bless this young man
His parents raised him right....
What a great kid 😊❤🎉
That is a kind of "social agreement" i would say.  I am from Berlin and i lost once my wallet and then later my bag in a club. The people, who found it, brought it back to my place.  A couple of years ago, i found a wallet on the street and i brought it back to the owner.  That's how the society works...  Kudos to his mom. who brought him up so well...
Karma will get you back kid. Good on him. ❤
Auntie can get it
Un hombre ejemplar!! 😊 Gracias por motivarnos a ser mejores personas ❤
Love hearing these stories
Good kid.
Wow need high quality men like this guy 🎉🎉
I wouldn’t let any body give me money for returning what’s theirs .
A moment of silence for times gone by where this behavior was the norm.
Give back immediately the woman bag in Milan when I return from Gatwick so she is Moroccan woman have inside everything passport all document credit card etc money as well immediately I find on site I take with me JUST AND ONLY for give back immediately I don’t accept anything if try to give me money 😘 is not for money is FOR RESPECT THE LIFE TO THE OTHERS AND DON T TAKE VANTAGE ON ANYONE.
I honestly don't understand why doing the right thing these days is such a huge deal. Sure, he spent 30 minutes of his time and some gas to return a purse. Their aunt should have given him $20 or $50 for his trouble. That's the right thing to do. End of story. If everyone is so surprised by his deed, does that mean they wouldn't do the same? Well, start with yourselves. This is the problem with our society - when someone actually does their job or "the right thing" or something they're supposed to, they make news. Sad. I'm happy for the kid, I just don't understand why it has to be news worthy. Thousands of things like that happen every day.
Cross our fingers that kid does not strafe away from the right path.
Well done son your the man honesty is the best policy
Wow, that is so admirable!!
Great job !! Holy nostrils
He's a credit to his parents, being so honest and returning the purse to the 0wner WELL DONE
Heart officially warmed.
Good Lad! Its encouraging to know theres good kids out who'll become fine upright citizens. His family should be Proud indeed.
Great job kid! Great job kids mother!
I did this plenty of times.
I hope my future son will have as much integrity as this kid
I just started to make youtube shorts, i appreciate every support and let me know what i could do better thanks and happy day <3
Someone is always watching.
What a nice young man. 🙏
Central cee doing side quests
looks like he prolly was thinking wow hot chicks live here now's my chance type of deal. lemmi put mah chain on and turn my cap backwards lol
Integrity.
Many Heavenly Blessings to you, young man😇.   Mr. Adrian Rodriguez's Good Character is a Treasure to behold indeed.  And it shall serve him well in Life.  SHALOM-SHALOM 🙏🏽🙏🏽🏆🏆
God Bless him, good job!😊❤
I've lost my wallet 2 times and it was always turned in with all the cash
I hope that young man flourishes
Island kid
He's 18 now ;D
Bless your soul young man
( there is hope for the younger generation)…. A bold claim looking at 2024
The most scary part of this is, how easy it is to find anybody nowadays.  Just post a picture or video online and you’ll find him.  Brave new world…
Standard practice in most overseas locations. Each generation pays it back.
I love it ❤
and Trump is running around saying this kid is the reason for the problems in America...while Trump sits in a court room charged with defrauding the American public...go figure...
Great young man right there👌🏾
GOD IS WITH THIS FINE GOOD SAMARATAN
Thank you sir! You rock!
Good kid, not many like that today
😂😅😊🎉❤
Aunty can pay him back tho 🐯
I lost my wallet once and i had just cashed my paycheck. So it had all the money in it. Someone found it and contacted me. I had my work ID in it so he was able to contact me. I asked him why he didnt just keep it... He said he saw i had a little girl and prolly needed it to pay for family and rent etc.   So if i ever find a wallet ill always return it as long as it has info in it to contact the owner.
Great young man. Plenty of good people around of all ages. Media just normally show us people doing bad things. Maybe if we saw more of this type of person we’d be better off.
it does say a lot about him - but also about how his parents raised him!!!
Good kid
Oh that’s so nice. I hope he gets into a good university
the same exact thing happened to me! somebody dropped it off at my house to my husband and i was like you didn't get her info! lol
God is always watching. 🙏🏼✌🏼🇺🇸
what the media should always show the world
Bunch of ignorant folks commenting.
So happy to see people celebrating young people. It feels like so much of the time, anything said about teens and young adults is negative.  We need to lift people up!
What an amazing young man! God blessing you richly 🙏🙏❤️
I returned a purse once and then she hit me with it. I never brought my wife’s purse to her again.
What a good kid
I once returned an id to someone who dropped it in a Walmart parking lot. Drive all the way there and didn't even get a thanks, now I won't do anything for anyone.
That ain’t what he was hoping for…
good kid. unfortunately he well grow to find most people will mistake his kindness for weakness and take advantage of it.
It’s sad when doing the right thing becomes breaking news 😢
The hope in the next generation lies solely in the efforts of the parents who come from the generation before them.
What a great kid!
Lil bro stood on bidness
He bout to go buy a pack
I bet he thought she was cute looking at her ID and just returned it lol
And now the IRS will be after him for years.
It's actually kinda sad that this is even a story. This is what most people did. Most of my life only until recently. How's this not been the case? It's actually really quite sad
You know he took a peek though😂
🥺🥺🥺❤️‍🩹🙏🏽
I wont even accept go fund me money
The aunt was mewing
Great kid, well raised.  Him mom should be proud of her son!
He was raised by good people 🇬🇧
One time I walked 40 blocks to give some one there phone back and didn’t even get a thank you
He looks like the kinda kid who would steal your purse.. note not to judge a book by its cover
Three grand?
That was a rare occasion.
Well done for the parents.. what an amazing young man. Rightly rewarded.   🎉
Thata more gangster then any of you gangbangers
Well done parents
I’m glad he was rewarded well! Something to think about next time he finds himself in position of picking between right and wrong.
One time when I was on the way to Vancouver with my mom she left her purse at one of the counters by accident, but when we came back it was gone. We thought she lost it for good so she cancelled all her cards and stuff, but about a month later she got the purse back in the mail. When she looked inside she saw that all her cards and ID were still there, but the person that had stolen it had taken all the cash in there (around $800). But the weirdest thing was my mom had pictures In there of me and brother from when we were kids and our family, and when she looked inside she saw there was like 3 of the 10 pictures missing from the wallet. So the person actually went through and decided which pictures to take and which to leave 😭
God bless this young man. It may have been a 😊 it's still a beautiful thing to read. I hope you always lead with your heart young man. You made your mom proud.  Keep being such a wonderful man
Good job brother. He clearly has great parents !!!!
A good kid for sure
Way to go! 👏👏👏
Respectable, good job dude!
Should not be special for someone to do the right thing, but it still is. More people like him will make the world better, in fact he is all ready doing it.
I once found a wallet in a shopping cart. I alerted the store staff and they told me that the woman had just left the a moment ago and rushed out to the parking lot to bring her back in.  When I handed her the wallet I didn't expect anything except maybe a "thank you." What I got was "Where's the lottery ticket?" I told her I didn't find that, just the wallet.  She actually proceeded to question me regarding the whereabouts of that f***ing scratch off... Ungrateful Karen.
Damn I need to return all those purses I stole 😮
Awesome…who I want my kids to be👏👏👏👏👏🇦🇺
He'a gonna get some "reward" from Eliana..
Well I bet he didn’t expect that kind of reward if any.
Had chains on and his pants sagged full gangster yet gave the purse back better yet drove to the address to hand it back 😢 this was awesome he definitely deserves the money as a reward
good karma and his mother taught him very well!!!
This world needs more young people like this young man. God bless him
And you probably still clutch your purse when someone that looks like him is coming towards you, smh
Nice to see positive news for a change , what a nice kid , great to see
👍🏾🤎
So nice to get GOOD news out of California once in awhile!
I love hearing about these young kids  today doing the right moral thing!!!   Bless him and his mom raising a good young man!!  Thanks for sharing
I think it says a lot about both parties almost equally to be honest, a lot of people wouldn’t of thought or considered trying to pay back his good deed but she did without hesitation and I definitely think that says a lot about her too and everyone that donated 😊👍. Thoroughly good people all round to be honest
I did this when I was 16, got 10 dollars, omg 3000 would have been awesome 😅 but I was happy with whatever
I love good new like this.
limited edition boy.
Honesty is so rare these days they make u tubes about them
He looks like Central Cee
Great kid great mother well done.
Trump would have put him in jail because of his heritage!
He saw the license and was hoping for another type of reward
Good job man 💪❤️🙏👏
Damn what a good Samaritan ❤
🫡🙏
Well done… from all the shoplifting videos … there is hope there
Don't judge a book by its cover
His mom raised him to a very good boy ❤
Good things happen to good people.😊
Again the mainstream media doesn't want you to see this , Americans helping Americans!!
Honest young man!
Good job my dude, beer on me💯💯
What if she started screaming and calling the cops lmao
Even if you don't get seen and get money as a reward you still get the smile of a human being and knowing you helped someone
Not all gangsters wear cortezes😂
Take note all you 17 year old kids with no morals and destined for a life of crime. This young man did the absolute right thing. Life is full of choices, and even if you make the right choice every time, life will not go your way. However, you'll show the world your true colours and IF your good deed ( however big or small ) is noticed by the right person, the outcome will always be worth it. Now he's $3000 better off. I hope he used his brain and did some good with his reward. Bravo.
Good lad.
Well done sir!
I done that before some girl in the neiborhood lost her id i returned it too her dad .
Mom should be super proud...If I get my business up and running in San Diego, I will offer your son a Job!
He saw her picture and said “JACKPOT!” 😂
OH SI !!
3? IT WAS 3700..
Great kid bravo
Great job ❤
what would you do with make up and a credit card :P jokes aside, the piece askes why didn't he do something else. why WOULD you do something else. take it to the license or take it to the lost and found. I'm not sure if i would take it to lost and found or go through someones purse to see who owned it though. thats where my mind would be in this situation.
This once again shows the importance of good parenting combined with teaching them the right values. I hope this now adult finds his way in this world:)  (and.. I could probably learn a thing or two from him... )
amazing and honorable man
Yes, he did a good thing, but its sort of a sad commentary on our culture that someone performing what any decent person should do, is on TV being hailed almost as a hero.
Nice!!!!❤😊
..”Fine young man” WTH it’s the news😂
Job job mom
"Do the right thing. It will gratify some people and astonish the rest." (Mark Twain)
Did she really say they did a GoFundMe for that SMH
Good kids, good parents. Noce job 👍 we need more humans with values like this.
bro just got 3 bands
Raised proper. 🎯
Credit where it's due, this young man's Mother can be proud of what he did.
Good kid, the world needs many more people like him ❤
Somebody raised this kid right. Well done Adrian!
Very cool story, may God bless him and his Mom for teaching him good lessons!
God bless that kid's heart, and God bless his mom for raising him right. Looks like there IS hope for Gen Z.
He has one good momma.  What a great kid!
THAT WAS AMAZING BEAUTIFUL 😮😮😮😮😮😊😊😊THANKS
NOW THAT'S A GOOD MAN!!!
So did they find him and give him his rewards .....His parents bring him up well......He did his parents proud !!!
Good job for that guy👏👏👏
Let’s be real  He saw the ID andwas tryna CLAP 👏🏼
God bless this young man. We need more people like him in this world. There's hope for the young generation after all
What was inside the purse was not worth the trouble, it was better to try to get a reward
He was raised right. Congratulations to his mom.
Well done Adrian you make your Mama and everyone watching proud.💗
great man with great values raised right.
Parents raised him right, and good morels goes along way
In reality if you were that good of a person you wouldnt accept money or a gift for doing a good deed like returning a purse personaly me it would be a great thing but i wouldnt take it bcs it should be a given
Dude saw the pic on her ID and tried to land a cougar lol Jk. Good on this man.
Someone give this Young Man a Decent Job if he ain't got one already. "You Cannot go wrong". Good ethics and he makes an effort to carry that out - a rarity in today's generation - better get onto that one ! 👍
Stand up young man 👍 good on him . Karma made its way around to him early on this one 😁
Good job
What a sweet young man his mumma tort him right
dangerous to do that now. glad it worked out
I lost my bank card once with my whole paycheck still on it, a guy who lives near my house found it and he basically lived on the street, he could have go to the store and spend all my cash since he didn't need a pin code, he read the name on the card and started asking around, found my brother and told him he found my card, I couldn't believe my ears when I heard THAT guy found it and didn't spend anything, I went to his house gave him some money and 2 bags of groceries I got for him and his family, never judge a book by it's cover was a lesson I relearned that day.
Great job by both the kid and the parents.
5-6 years ago, I found a woman’s wrist wallet on the street in Pittsburghs South Side. I grabbed it and immediately went to Facebook to try and find her. Found her and sent a message, but after an hour of no answer, I then search her on LinkedIn. Luckily she had her resume attached to it. Got her number and sent her a text. After a few minutes, she came to the bar I was at, and she thanked me for giving it back to her. Had she not responded, I would’ve went to her household and dropped it off since she lived 20 minutes away from where I did.
He got ticket for heaven, too.
Nice to hear about good deeds in a world where there aren’t enough of them. ❤️🙏
A great man in the making 👏👏👏👏👏
My father found on a table what he thought was a camera case then when he and his family went to eat they looked in it to see if they could find an ID. They ended up finding over $20,000 plus another $10,000 in lira which was Italian money. He got home and called the police, and they flipped out stating that it was report stolen but they had a feeling they had lost it instead. They came to pick it up and the officers were just amazed that my father had called it in, and he just stated it was not his to keep. I have always returned anything I have found including wallets and our family still has this instilled into us.
They wound up getting married
he dropeed this -->👑
haha I see this vid in my recommended all the time, what a gud dude.
I once found some cash on the street in Nuremberg (Germany) found some more and then I found some migration documents of a japanese guy. At first I was really happy for the cash but when I saw the important documents I immediately realized that I have to find that person and give everything back. I found him on facebook brought it over and when I left he asked for my postal address. I told it to an asian friend of me and he said "man, you dont know nothing about japanese culture, he will give you some riich gifts" I wasn't sure about that but felt good because I helped that guy. A few weeks later I received a biiig package full of japanese stuff and a 100 Euro giftcard for amazon. felt fine
They dumb how could you js leave a purse and still keep a smile wit em fake lips
his parents should be very proud
Nice kid.
looks like a hoodlum but has good character, good job kid
In Hawaii we call it being pono🤙🏽
Thank God we still got some good people in this ugly world 🙏💯❤️ I want to send a shouted to this special young boy keep doing you you gonna do something special with your life May God Bless you and shield you 🙏💯
Integrity is doing the right thing even when no one’s watching.  Bravo young man.
Dope!...good kid. Also ;) should always help...never know might be a gorgeous human being you're helping
As a kid ( over 40 years ago) i once found a wallet with nearly £500 in it, id never seen that much money in my life before, in fact id never seen more than £20 at the time, so i took it to the police station and handed it in. A few weeks went by and i got a letter asking to attend the police starion. I was really worried thinking id done something really bad, but when i arrived the police took me into a room where an old couple were sitting and it turned out to be the owner of the wallet, they were so very very grateful and wanted to personally hand me a card to say a huge thank you. When i opened it up there was £150 inside. I gave £100 to my mum and gave each of my sibblings £10 each. So not only dod it make me feel good about doing the right thing and handing in the wallet but i was then also able to help my family out and me and my sibblings also got to go to the toy store and get an unexpected treat. Doing the right thing has always made me smile. P.s the old couple that rhe money belonged to was for urgent veterinary care for their long term family dog, without handing that money in, he would have had to be put down. X
I would do the same thing no greed or jealousy from my part
When i was 9 I could have had a hundred or so if I was sneaky. But, how would I explain it to my parents? So I showed them the purse I found on the road and the money I picked up leading up to it (friends said they'd seen it on the roof of a car driving). All told, about $200. They found the address on whatever ID was inside and organised the postage. A couple of months later a letter, card and $20 were in the letterbox as a thankyou. For a nine-year old in 1984 twenty dollars was quite the lump sum.
His mum did a terrific job!  Well done young man, I’m so pleased your honesty and decency paid off for you 👏🏻🇬🇧
Its crazy to think that doing the right thing is considered news now. Good on him though.
No wee annoyers streamers no pranks just an honest video of kindness. I could stay for that. 😉💚🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Good character right there , nicely done sir 👌
So sad that this made it into the news. This should be normal and not an extraordinary act of kindness. Edit: The news itself is of course showing a good example for others. The reward atleast might motivate others to be honest, even though 'being selfish' shouldn't be the motivation for honesty.
Good brought up ❤❤❤.
Far that's what you call a good kid with an awesome mum to install that in him so proud of them :)
There have been two times that I have found a woman’s purse left in a cart, once by Smith’s and the other time by Sprouts, each time I took the purse in and turned it into the managers.  Each time they asked me why I did not look through it, because my parents taught me to respect others and their property.   I just hope someday someone helps me out… God bless this young man.
God bless him and his mom 🙂  *Always do the right thing even when nobody’s looking*  He deserves the reward !
My man saw the picture and wanted to test his rizz.
Wow shocking now a days, this   Young guy is so wonderful.
Once as a teenager when i was delivering peoples mails i saw a wallet outside a door (on the street outside the apartments) i rang the doorbell of the person who was living there and the woman was so happy that i returned it even tho she didn't even realise she dropped it it felt very good
A guy returns a lost purse (which needles to say is the right thing to do) and this becomes big news? Then one should ask himself/herself: what kind of country do I live in?
1 in a million these days!
Nice job young man. WHO Carry’s $3,000 cash in their purse
Good on his mom for instilling great values in her son and for him to follow them. 🫡
God Bless you son
I still dont understand the whole logic behind being rewarded so highly for not stealing a bag. I get neing punished for doing the opposite.
Good job young feLLa. ❤
Last Hope in humanity:
the real question is was there even anything of value in the purse? if not then maybe he was expecting a big reward for returning it
That is called integrity...
If you live in Denmark, this is not that weird, but still nice. I once lost my wallet, and got it back. The finder was a young student, and she even had to find me first, since I lived in a co adress. And then came to meet me to bring my wallet. She was a true hero too. I have found wallets and creditcards, I always find the owner, or give it to the lokal police office
What a breath of fresh air. Those parents can be proud that they instilled good moral values in their son.❤️🙏
Good job! Well deserved reward
Good young man ❤
God Bless.
He is good samaritan and raise in a good family.
Doing the right thing because someday you might find yourself in the same situation
after seeing these two ladies. I understand how they would lose a purse
Don't be too confident about todays youth, he's one in 10 million.
Smart kid…he did the right thing 🫡
Odd 3k for returning  a purse is a lil outrageous  if you think about  it logicly ?
in a world of dishonesty, its nice to see some people havent let it defeat them.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Amen we still live the lords children too what's rite.
when someone gains something in life, it doesnt come from thin air. Someone had it to begin with you never know the full story when you just look at the surface and ignore what's inside
👍👍👍 It’s nice to see American values once again.
I love it! What a nice thing for him to do. We need more young people showing the same.
Blessings to the boys family
I would have asked the lady out on a date.
Damn now he has to pay taxes on it. Stoopid media
I see this young man having a bright future
That is the definition of a great man. It's not what u do when everyone is watching. It's what u do when there's nobody watching that counts. Great story, and many blessings to ALL parties involved. Great Job.
He looked like the guy who would take your purse, instead, he showed up out of nowhere and got out of his way to bring back this purse ❤😮
I was raised by my own mom saying the same. Just do the right thing, even if no one is watching...
What's his @?
The purse: Lipstick/ 5 singles/ a note of an address/ drivers license.
Plot twist it's her kid
Proof that kindness is the most memorable gift 🎁.
Lovely young man, blessings to him and his Mum for raising such a wonderful person.
I want both of y’all and that 3k 😂
Good job mom!
This is sooo wonderful. Train up a child in the way he should go and he will NEVER depart! ❤
He listened to his Mother's advice. Good Mother, good son. God bless them both.🙏🏾
There's a bunch of people that do the correct things 😊
See, I love seeing people doing the right thing..... But I laugh because I would never answer the door... bahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!! I would peek in the window until he went away.... Maybe this is why none of my lost stuff has ever turned back up.... But good on him and also so cool for the girls to raise money for someone doing a good deed that he knew he wasn't getting anything in return for...
Can’t really tell now a days kids do crazy things for money. I will take my hat off to this guy if he done this out of his heart. Really rare you see this now a days.
🤜🤛 well done young man. Much respect to you.
Well bred, in the true sense of the word! ❤Keep it up young man! 👌💜💯
He wanted a date with the lady on the id lol
Do good things n God  reward u beyond measures countess as sand on t shore
She should have show him her gratitude in more... "personal" way.
My reward would have been a purse
He was raised by good, honest decent parents. Doing the right thing is it's own reward but his beautiful character was additionally rewarded by a grateful  recipients His mama must be extremely proud of his honest conscience  and good heart. He has stored up some mighty amazing treasures in heaven. He is not my child but I am proud of him truly. I was taught these same values. I went to a lovely extravagant party and while I was in the ladies room I spotted an impressive diamond & ruby bracelet on the carpeted floor.  It was a $200,000 bracelet. I had the emcee make an announcement about a lost item.  A woman that reminded me of my beloved granny found me and she described  the bracelet down to the Harry Winston hallmark.  She cried because it was given to her by her husband  just weeks before he died. I started crying too because I could see her emotional reaction upon my returning  it to her.  I was so surprised when just a week later I received a bouquet of flowers and a check for $5000 from her.  She  wrote the sweetest note to me thanking me. I was 23 at the time and I can still hear my mom's voice telling me She was proud of me.  It is always the right time to do the right thing. This young man is a hero!!!
Beautiful!
Many blessings in his future, I pray.
Well done to that young man his parents brought him up well 👍👍👍👍so lovely to read this about him.
So, if you do what is absolutely human and normal, you get a huge reward. Just think: "in what a world we live in." God Bless you all.
Just have a three way with him and call it a day
Now that is a real man! Way to go, bro! Karma will embrace you...
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 great job, young man!
Why doesn’t stuff like this get mass headlines?
Hope
An excellent man!  I hope he runs for office!!
God bless  him and him mommy ❤ 🙏 ♥ 😢
❤❤
That's a good hearted young man may he receive Blessings through our his life❤
When you lost it, it's already lost. So giving them 1/4, 1/2,  3/4 of what on your purse should be normalized.
I remember I turned in a wallet with $700 and was rewarded for it too. Yes indeed we should all do the right thing, nice one kid
back in the days as a 12 year old, 3 friends and me found a bag with 4k inside. friends mum called the police and like 4 weeks after, the guy gave us 200 each. i felt like a millionaire :D
LOVE IN ACTION ❤
Notice the content of his character (outstanding young man)
And I guarantee he gave his moms $2k.
Respect bro
❤❤❤
This guy got  3K for returning, a purse and the guy who returned 135k I only got 500 bucks cash
Thats a great man right there!
La amiguita habla toda Colombiana en el inglés.
We definitely need more people like him.
What really strikes me is the way he dresses. When I wear similar things I get treated like im on drugs or am a thug, even when im 5 foot and get confused for a 12 year old. Really shows you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.
His parents must be very proud.
Bro could use it for a car
he fynneee too
😢😢😢
❤
What a good dude 😊
How come the GoFundMe page is no longer there? Usually when GoFundMe's end the page is still there 🤔
Now he sittin real pretty. Look at you now carnal❤❤❤
Beautiful ❤️
Damn Fosho homie was trying to get them cheeks 😂 he set the play up
His mother did a great job. Good work, Adrian!
Respect !!!
Wishing the kid the best life. 🙏
NICE ! 💙 🤑 $$$ well done young man ! 👍
Just a representation of how doing something good and Kind often rewards u with something for picking the Right Choice over Urself or ur greed. What im trying to say is that all people should be more Kind to eachother and They start wondering why their life will reward them with happiness and just good vibes or new persons who turn into fellow friends .
That is a great thing
I return Amazon package all the time…
Womens power for one bloody purse  they can change man's life :)
Imagine if her friend moved because of a serious conflict between them, she would’ve most definitely would have taken everything when the kid returned it and all of the hard work of this young man would’ve been for nothing
Having been so sad about this generation, this actually has me crying happy tears. Great job young man! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Clout chase fake
Never set things on top of your car! Such a nice young man to try to return it safely!
Good job lil bro going places🫡
A few months ago I found a phone, it had one of these cases were cards can be put in and the card that was in it was an id. Since the address on the id was only a few kilometers away I just walked. The owner wasnt home so I gave it to a neighbor, they asked me if I wanted to leave my number in case she wanted to give me some money. I declined. A good dead is even better when you dont expect anything in return, still feel great about that lol
This is very common here in Iceland, glad to see some of that in the states!
Why is every thugger named adrian. 💀
Thats nice, and I'm glad he got the money but I dont think we should be rewarding stuff like this as much,  we should just learn to all be just as kind and thoughtfull as him
His good kid, you can see on his face and eyes, that shows he have good heart and innocent face and the his mother raise him as good person, god bless him and good fortune for him and his family 🙏👍❤️
king
Ase`🙏🏾 Blessings to All
What A Nice guy
This man holds up his generation with hope ✨🥹
Bro was playing Good Samaritan for them cheeks
The friend was hella fine🥵🥵
He so fine 😝
❤
Now imagine that he was stopped by the police with this purse in his hands... Lucky.
This true Black Lives Matter!
Kids these days never doing good things like this 😢😂😊😅😮
Lucky luxe die velen nie kunnen ontvangen
GOOD, HAPPY NEWS FOR A CHANGE - BRAVO TO THE YOUNG MAN!!!!!!!
Doing something that is right even when no one is watching! “Integrity”, I got a kanji tattoo meaning of it. Absolutely outstanding kid
Love this!! He deserves the reward!
Little did he know, his good deed would reach so many other people and restore their faith in humanity. Good kid
I would've done the same, it's not a big thing. It won't change your life to keep somebody's stuff and small money.
Respect!
I live by a high school. Couple of the bikes were stolen by the high school kids and then we started to locked the bikes. One day a black lady knocked on the door and told me her high school son found a wallet on the sidewalk by our house and the driver license shows the address.  It was my son’s wallet, it fell out his pocket.  She stopped by and left a sticky note on my door but somehow the sticky note fell off flew off on the side of the house.  Few days later the mom came back again and I was home and she explained to me and returned the wallet, I checked and nothing is missing.  I was so grateful, there’s so many good people out there. Hurray to that high school boy and the mom. 😘
Good young man!!!!!   That’s news I LOVE to hear.
I bet that kid has a good father.
❤😮
Need a lot more kids to be like this
A California teen when good things, a Mexican when bad things. Typical  hypocrisy of Usa
Bruhhhhhh he stole it and brought it back 😅😂
if original gangster was a person
original gangster
Nowadays, doing good deed is rare😢 what happened to this universe
She bad asf😭😭
Bro was tryna hit that 😭
Love it
Hello Eliana!
tats her son lmao
Definitely clapped
Bro was tryna hit 😅
What a gentleman. I am sure the Lord, is going to reward him
He knew what he was doing theres was nothing in that purse so he figured he get something for the return 😁
🥲🥲
I wish I find a purse with 50k to return it to the owner and get 3k 🙏
I want him😩  edit hes in my SAN DIEGO TOO? he need to come my way fr
You don't see a lot of this happening!!!! Way to go young man!!!
There is still hope❤
Never judge a book by its cover yo young man you gave the world hope thankyou
Doing the right thing, even when no one is watching is called Integrity. Good to see some younger folk with some.
You can tell this guy has a special heart. A good person would've just brought the purse to customer services at the grocery store. The fact that he actually drove out of his way to make sure the owner got their purse back is just awesome.
Star boy😊
Mom sure did a hell of a job with this wonderful young man....and kiddo, your character speaks volumes .....Spirit knows, and will remember what you did.
Central Cee returns lost purse
Much love respect❤
Imagine if he was pulled over on the way there. No officer would have believed he was returning it.
Top kid. Honesty pays in more ways than one.
He was raised good
This tells us that Never Judge a Book by its Cover!
So we live in a world where someone is a hero for returning a purse to its owner. Oh dear. This is the normal thing to do.
He only did it because he knew he’d get a reward of some sort afterwards.
Great kid 😊
Tears of happiness ❤so heart felt good job mom!!!! 🙌🏽 I know you proud!!!! Great job young man!!!! So kind of the women rewarding him as well!!!! 🥰👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
A true gentleman! He didn't even post a video of himself doing a good deed to social media for attention! I support this King!
What a great kid that is why you should never judge a book by its cover
This was staged! Staged I tell you.
Bravo to this teen. It's appaling how many people would have kept it.
Amazing person we need more of people like this .
His   Very   Host   Good job
Plot twist it was setup and the money all went to the girls and they knew the guy
I’m watching a lot of people doing good things and doing the right things. This is a great day on YouTube
Great job mom❤
Could take the money out and return it anyway for the reward lol
He loves hot moms simple as that
God bless him!🙏❤️
Always do a good deed❤
Bro waited to decide what to do, saw the house and the car in the driveway, and knew it was a payday
Atta be young man. Young ladys. And parents.
Raised well and probably someone above he knew he couldn't dissappoint.
Always do the right thing and Allah will bless you along the way 🙏 Allah bless you young man
This is what happened when you raise your child right. It's the parents who send out angels or demons into the world.
From the way he's dressed, I would never have guessed that he would be this honest.  Looks can be so deceiving.
who is this fine man i need him😩
Adrian 💪💯
See don't judge a book by its cover his parents raised him right.
world needs WAY more of this...parents take notes
Kudos young man
its pretty normal you get your lost stuff back here  in india
A white kid would have been scolded
Good kid
Love these stories!!!!
It's hard to find good kids like him these days. Grats to his mom for raising him right.
CHARACTER. GUY SHOULD RUN FOR PRESIDENT😂
Fake
i blame his parents. well done to both the kid and those who raise him.
The definition of integrity!
💯🫡💯
The news needs a more positive influence like this.
Wow that was inspiring good job young man
I want to cry this was so touching ❤ What a promising young man. I hope that $3k goes to his education or whatever else he really, really needed. This speaks volumes about his integrity as a person.
He was a fine young man and will go very far in life.
Thx.
Now this is "Sigma"
Great kid a true man already in my eyes
Imagine THIS is worth a news. It should be absolute normal behavor but sadly its the absolute opposit.
Dresses like a thug, behaves better than most people dressed properly. What was the saying again? never judge a book by it's cover?
plot twist: the purse now contains cocaine
God bless him immensely, a young man with character, maturity and love.
good man
Great kid from great parenting ❤
God bless this dude his mom raised him well
Wow ❤ he is such a great man. Well Done😊😊😊
Wow what a great man he is ❤❤❤❤
Respect to this young man
He’s a real one!
Why didn't you show us how he was getting his reward ?😭
when I do it , its always " I Have a Boyfriend" or "Leave me alone" and " Howd you get in my house?"
Imagine if parents actually raised their kids instead of giving them a gun on their birthday like the crumbleys
His mother is a class act, she taught her son the most important lesson in life - integrity. Integrity, is doing the right thing, even when nobody is watching.
I would do the same and refuse to accept anything in return. This much decency every human being should have.
🙏🏽💝✝️
Great parenting ='s GREAT KIDS 💯
OHHHHHHHHH MY  GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD WOW HOPE FOR HUMANITY
I found someone's purse in a shopping cart outside of market basket with there phone wallet and major credit cards it took me almost 4 hours to track them down through friend and family and found out they lived 2 hours from me so I drove it to them not expecting anything in return it was a elderly lady her and her husband wrote me a check whoch i declined and now every year around Christmas they send me a beautiful card with gifts for my son! It really goes along way helping out people!
Glad you did not disrespect the kid with $20 offer.
He is proof that regardless of religious beliefs or anything like that, if you live by the golden rule (treat others how you want to be treated) life will be ok.
Really not that hard to be a nice person.
Because she bad asfk
Maybe I'm wrong about the world just maybe they're a very little few good people out there but I was n shocked 😲 what this young man did doing the right thing u don't c that everyday
Love this! Great kid. We’re hiring if you want a job
Did he actually get the money !! He’s such a sweet kid still hood in this world ❤
omg
Cool
Respect to this kid keep doing the right things in life success will come
Great to see kids that's raised well, amazing young man.
Why was her friend's driver's license in her purse?
1:58 / 2:04
I found a someone’s new iPhone in a shopping cart in a parking lot. Took home and waited for them to call. Met them and gave it to them and the gentleman forced me to take 20$ even tho I refused he forced it on me and thanked me and left. It was his young daughters phone. I was happy to just make sure they got it back safely
He got blessed
You go young man!! Keep it up, you will go far...amazing job mama!!
Yay!!!! Great job Everyone!!! Mother of the guy.  The himself and the family of the lady who lost purse.  Yay!!!!
Awesome young man!  Love that saying ........ always do the right thing even when no one is looking.  Words to live by.
A great story for change. Good for him and his mother for teaching him to do the right thing.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Good lad 👏
TOP LAD!! ❤
Plot twist: He actually stole the purse but had 2nd thoughts
That kid will grow into good man
On a new episode of what if?. We dive deep  into the possibility of. WHAT IF... he stole the purse and used it to get the reward money Lmao.
We need more parents to raise children with integrity like this young man!!! The Lord has truly guided this boy's parents and it shows!
Sick ass foo
How very sweet of the teenager to bring back her purse. Same exact thing happened to me. I left my wallet, with all the money i had in the world in my shopping cart. I got home home and realized what i had done so i drove 25 miles back to the store and found it where i left it, in a cart. Everything was in it still, Except my Money 😢. Wished there was a honest person that found my wallet that day plus my $50. But God took care of me and got me through the month 😊
No one watching but GOD keep watching  ..
Looks like exactly the type that would steal a purse, but he goes out of his way to return it! Shows you should never judge a book by the cover
well done young man
Way to go! 🫶
the young man knows what honor is.
I found a shoe 👞 in the parking lot. Who do I return that to get $3,000 reward?
This really goes to show, don’t judge a book by its cover.
See what good parenting do? Incredible.
Honesty paying off
Finally some positive news from the garbage and corrupt corporate media.
They gave him money?  they should have given him a little sucky sucky.
God sees All ❤
So weird seeing the overexaggeration of such an action which is considered basic human behaviour and self-respect in Japan.
and he’s cute 😂😂 I want his ig
Shows how important a good upbringing is. Congratulations to the young man, his mother, and the team for surprising him with such a generous gift.  I do hope this video encourages everyone to ALWAYS choose to do the RIGHT THING. Goodness should be practised intensely.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️
I feell the same Way about your generation.  God bless you in Jesus name Amen 🙏
Respect 🫡
Aspire to be this man fr
True Hero!
Great job kid !
A fine upbringing
Congratulations to this young man's Mum for raising an honest and descent person
good on you kid !! Going to show if you raise em right to go good deeds, this is what comes of it.
Just because someone knows the righr thing to do, it doesn't mean that they will automatically do it!  This young man is an inspiration and helps to quieten those people who have only criticism for his generation. Blessings and peace be with him always.
Your awesome adrian👍🏻
There’s too many surveillance and cell phone cameras to keep the money.
God Bless that young man
Sooooo good!! ❤❤❤
He was raised with class dignity and compassion. I hope he has a protected safe and abundant  life . Old soul.
Love this story
I always look for the owner unless it’s 1000% not possible after my attempts. I have returned 100 bills cells phones md wrong packages B! EVERY ONE RETURN
Very happy to see that there is still honest person’s out there ❤
Keep setting a good example young man, it will take you far. Nice work, keep it up, good things will find you.
Good kid but kinda sad that this is so out of the norm that it's newsworthy lol
The Golden Rule! Good young man.  6⁶6--That level of integrity isn't too common these days.  Respect
That warms my heart! 😭
love stories like this. i wish for him, many blessings to come! 🥹🙏💫
Every one was like did u crazy I would have keep it I was like what about the camera that's above the ATM would have seen me taking it and my luck I would have got on knock at the door its just best to be honest it usualy comes back 100 fold lol
Believe it or not something like that happened to me I drove up to the ATM at my bank vystar and 300$ was stick out the cash slot like some one figured they couldn't get that much and drive off leaving it there so I took it in side like good guy got a 20$ home Depot card lmao 🤣
That’s really cool, especially with him being a young man.
Adrian your did your family proud 💯 Always do the right thing!
Bros got drip
these things do happen
"there is hope for the younger generation" is a really backhanded thing to say...
its sad how people think its a huge thing to do what the guy did when in arab and muslim countries its a basic and modest thing to literally do because MOST ppl there actually have self respect and wouldnt steal what so ever
This is a good lad from a good family!  Wonderful story
Nice job, son. Very impressed!!!
When no ones watching and now everyone is watching, that his reward
I would expect more $$$
The one on the right? Smash next question
You can just stick it in the post office box too and the mailman will return it to them...
Good morals,good guys!!!
When an awesome boy❤
the question remains. Would he bring the bag back if there had been something like 1000 bugs inside ?!
I’ve done this myself except they got mad at me tho idk why..-
Good parents
Good man
Dude saw her ID, thought she was fine and thought he had a chance 😂
Good kid but honestly.... forget about the reward id be asking those 2 beautiful women for a weekend sleepover  instead🎉😮
Good boy!!
LETS GO, ADRIAN! 🎉🤝
Hideous old ladies and that kid will be in prison one day probably
He just improved his chances of getting a well paid job cause they know he will be honest and do good things
great guy. His mother can be very proud of her son.
This our neighborhood... ❤❤❤❤ i had 3 males walk by come back & unload the bags of rocks for me 10 bags 30lbs each!!! Wouldnt take money either.. youn teens....❤
Beautiful story what a blessing
This teen is truly well raised.Such a good guy!
I used to work at SEARS when i was 18. I found a guy's cell phone. I called his contacts and told them to notify him i found it. When he came to get it back he accused me of putting scratches on it and walked off...
That was awesome n God bless him 🥰🥰
Bro was tryna clap cheeks he seen the id and was like dam and his homie like take it back she will prolly let u smack ahahaha
On a realistic note. He probably went through the bag, found there was no cash in it, then thought "damn! No cash. But if i take it back, perhaps they will give me a reward" lol!
The sad thing is if the police had stopped him. He would of got changed with stealing it
His go fund me reached over 17k
Once, my mom, who doesn't have any extra money, left her wallet, with $300 cash, in a shopping cart, by accident. She got home, realized it was missing, and frantically rushed back to the store to see if she could retrieve it. Some great Samaritan turned it into customer service, untouched,  money inside.
What a wonderful young man.
I wish this type of actions wouldn't surprise our community. This has to be something that it's normal to happen
That voice..
This kid's full college tuition should be paid. I'd definitely donate to that. Great job, Adrian!
Says a lot about his mom!!!❤❤❤
Good for you kids this is how IV raised my son who is 19 now I'm so happy to see that this world isn't completely lost
This is the basic, minimum anyone should do in this situation
❤❤❤
Man of the people
he saw how fine they were
See...good always come back to you.....god bless him hes a awesome young man and your mom raised you right..❤❤
Bro knew what side quests give when u complete them. Lol.
We should also STOP REWARDING PEOPLE when they do things right also. Being good is normal, it doesnt need financial coercion or reward, goodness itself it is the reward. IF there is a reward it can be suitable reward. Not like crowd funding for thousands of dollars for a good act which people do everyday.
Good work Brutha.
Typical Mexican not to switch their address after moving out. It's an ongoing thing with them. Lol
he saw that she looked good in the license picture so he wanted to be her hero :P jk ofc
This young man, has a Bright Future! Just my opinion
Lovely young man mum did great job
Well done young man many blessings to your Mom for bringing you up to do tight for others 🙏🏼✝️♥️💯%...
...rejoice and be glad, for great is your reward in heaven...indeed...
Man’s smoking large
God Bless 🙌 🙌  🙌
“Always do the right thing, even when no one is watching” is the reason I dislike the current trend of doing nice things but holding a camera whilst doing it.  And yes I understand the content can then help to fund further nice deeds but it just doesn’t feel genuine when you film yourself doing something for the sole purpose of posting it online.
My wife found a neighbor purse and when she knock the door they didn’t say thanks and after a couple minutes they were knocking my door complaining there were $200 missed in the purse. They tried to accused her to lost the money, I told them to call the police and a week later another neighbor show them the cameras showing that a girl found the purse, took the money and throw the purse in the middle of the road.
I did that and got the door slammed on me.  Not even a thank you.😫
Very nice latinos , let us keep raising our kids right. ❤
Good story and even better, great person! I hope many good things happen for that young man!
The fact that something like this even had to be congratulated on the news speaks wonders about society. Most teenagers nowadays wouldn’t do that. I can’t even be sure I would in the moment. This guy was raised right.
I 2as a check out chick in the 80s i found a pencil case left by new jananese  businss men in our small fishing village. I found a black book in it $5,000 cash i found a local number in 5he black book a real estate agent who knew who these people were. I returned all in tact.  Some weeks later u applied for a job at HABBA dive i reminded them that was me who returned the bag i got the job. It pays to be honest
I'm Japanese, tbh I'm surprised that this got on the news. Everyone in Japan will do what he did.
God bless him please
This young man was her guardian angel that day. For anyone who thinks that is hyperbolic, she probably would have panicked thinking her money, driver’s license, and credit/debit cards were stolen, and it would have just made her day or week a living hell. Good on this young man. He clearly has a heart of gold.
bless her and bless him <3
YR MOM IS COMPLETELY AWESOME, THE WAY SHE "RAISED" YOUS WILL CARRY YOUS BEYOND YR WILDEST DREAM'S, I CAN ONLY HOPE DAT YOUS MY FAMILY, I DON'T PLAY DAT
You See Being With Mom & Dad In Your Initial Stages Of Childhood Is Really A Big Learing Experience. Whatever You Learn You Carry That In Your Whole Life 👍
He was hoping to get some real purse 😂
Matthew 7:12 So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets. The boy has a good soul
Finally, a positive story on our young ppl.
God bless his soul immensely.  And God bless his beautiful mother who taught him well.
Good on both ends, the kid for doing the right thing and the woman for not taking advantage of the situation and saying he did steal the money from her bag when he didn't.
Here’s to hoping I can find a lost purse too 😬
More reasons to believe life is beautiful.
Thats almost 4k lol
Life really be a Red Dead Redemption 2 good karma run
Plot twist, he took 20 bucks but she didn't notice
Someone did a great job raising him!
Warms my heart!
That woman was very blessed god allowed a young guy living in such a selfish time with a big enough heart to return that purse ✝️ I’ve had 2 phones stolen and people don’t understand that when you steal someone’s purse or a phone you could be stealing someone’s livelihood that could be important for their job for income or they probably can’t afford to buy another phone or the money you stole was money for them to eat because they live pay check to pay check or maybe they just had photos of a loved one that passed away that they’ll never get back but this is why Satan wants you to act not to think because he never tells you the consequences after just how good it will be in the moment because he distracts you from the blessing god has for those who do good deeds like this young guy who probably didn’t expect $3K in return
Good kid right there!
Mom did a great job
Bravo, dude! Great parenting and a kind soul is the reason this happened. I hope he receives many blessings   in life. I think he will.
when human decency is news-worthy xDDDD dumb news channel
Wow….a good deed. Rare breed. Kudos to this young man…and his mom. Karma…works both ways.
the fact this is headline news shows how fkd America really is 💀
Good kid.
Cant even do a normal thing these days without it being blasted on socials and a go fund me starting wtf
❤❤LOVE HIM❤❤
This is normal in Japan…
Things you love to see:
Naw, he was trying to get that WAP.
so its just a decent thing for any normal decent human being to do
Bro definitely stole it and saw the reward online 💀
Hope he reads all the good comments and realizes his deed helped and inspired others to make the world a bette place
Wow he was a blessing he got raised right ❤❤❤ he deserved it
What a good dude, man. Well done.
wow what a good kid
Don’t judge a book by its cover! I’m sure this teen gets judged by many!
Good man yourself
There is always someone watching
Awesome brother 👏
There's hope yet. 🙏
He never a cent of it 😂
great acting, I'll give 7 out of 10 Stars.
Well done a good news story for a change
Everyone in California is a poser gangster.
It’s sad that doing the right thing is considered unusual.
That’s was up my boy hell yea good stuff !! 🙌🏻
Never do this, the cops will end you
Congratulations to this young man's parents. Thank you
Awesome
He stole it to pretend to “return” it.
send him to jail hahahahaha
cool kid
I did this before and got $20 or $50 but refused it because I was just happy to help.
Could be fake. If real then god bless this man ❤
So I work in the movie industry as a key craft service . I just started a show , I would like to get this young man in the union and give him a job . This is exactly who we need working for us , I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t have to worry about him being late or doing a good job . If somebody can please help me out on how to reach him it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you !
So in the us your adress is on your driver license or id card 😂 wtf
Great kid 🖖🏽
There is Still some hope
That’s a good kid ❤
Hes adorable 😍🥰
the fact that this is something to reach news scale in USA, is crazy. I am living in Hellas, I myself once forgot even my laptop inside a bus, and I got it returned with just a phone call. As far as I know, this is what happens usually in normal countries. USA must be down really bad with scoiety.
And he didn't record it for likes. Well done man
What amazing kid god bless son ❤👏👏❤️⭐️🙏🏻🇮🇪
If na Nigeria teen, OTILO !!!
That this is news.
When I was a kid out biking with my friend one day, we found a wallet with some money in it.  We brought it to the owner at his apartment.  He took the wallet then slammed the door on us.  Whatever... we thought we did the right thing.
Great job young man great upbringing.
What a sweet young man - he was raised right!  ❤
Tf
And then later that night they invited him back for a reenactment of Wild Thing's
Nice for the kid they raised so much for him, but of course it's completely rediculous. He's a good kid though.
I hope my son turns out like that. At 8 years old its hard to tell yet. Kudos to his parents.
Great job dude.  Much respect!
Awe that’s so cool . He deserves 3000$
I love seeing these stories!😍👏
He looked at her I.D. thought she was hot, so he returned the purse to the address on the I.D.  that's all it was. He still has to hold up his pants with his hands, so his parents still didn't teach him to wear a belt. LOL 😂 I guarantee if he checked that I.D. and it was some 80 year old woman, he would have just taken it.....  come people... don't be foolish
Watching this after losing my wallet
He really made his mother proud! She was talking and he was listening 🎧😅😮😊  So amazing and inspiring they should put this on the news instead of the triggering nonsense.
That kid is a better man than most people.
Nice to see a youngster doing the right thing instead of everything we usually see on the news about kids doing wrong.
That kid most not be from so called the hood 😂broke peoples areas
he's a good guy, but there is not hope for young generation.
What a legend. I wish this honest young man the best life possible.
Heart warming and great story. There is faith in humanity ❤🤗
If only everybody was like this fine young man
Aw. Good kid. Nice to see some good stuff for a change.
Adrian Rodriguez, that was raw.
✨😭✨ The good deeds really go and back what q beautiful story
He got the friends number , ultimate rizz
They need more people like this in this world 🌎 there’s still people like this im so happy
Eliana isnt the sharpest knife in the drawer is she? 😂
Hey good on him, thankfully it wasn't a Karen's house then things would have gone completely different. Sorry to be that way and obviously I mean no offense to anyone ofc
Good man
Big Up Adrian. Very Cool.
Good kid, but hopefully he changes his attire, could be mistaken for a banger, and then it might not end well.......ask me how do it know? LOL
Stories like this do make one’s day. There is so much goodness in this our world and it makes one’s heart melt.
Good kid
He saw i.d. picture and was hoping he was gonna smash
Agreed.
What a great young man……he has a good mother….taught him well…..wish there were more young people like him….
Bless him <3
Going to steal someone’s purpose now and return it to owner thanks for the inspiration
only 3K
Good job mijo…your mother raised you well..
Good job young man 💪🏾!! Thank u to all the parents raising these kids right !
I'd respect him more even he didn't go waving his hand in the air to show who he was and possibly knowing there could have been a reward
This young man puts all the shoplifters and looters in CA to shame!
Now this is a well raised young man ❤and his parents should be very proud of him 🥰
Plot Twist: He found the bag with alot of money in it, and went to the address to return/scope out the property for a future heist. Unbelievable. xD
This is what good parenting get's you. Way to go mom you raise one hell of a young man.
*Honest young guy.* 🍀
I did this once, found a purse in a parkling lot, in a empty space. So i drove to the address on the id, no one was home so i just left it on the porch table. I bet she was relieved when she found it.
Such rare morals and ethics, his Mom must be so proud
What's sad is that so many people who see a kid like this will automatically judge him and think they know what kind of person he is...I hope this is also a learning experience for those who see someone and think they have that person all figured out. Anyone know how I can get in contact with this young man? We would like to send him some free merchandise, since I see he likes ProClub shirts
Good job good example of a honorable man you don’t see that anymore his parents must be proud
Good karma
It's funny how nowadays stuff like this is seen as a extraordinary thing. It's just kindness and being a decent human being.
dat lady has some big ass lips
Easy to return what you stole.           It’s a joke. Shut up.
My mom lost her driver’s license once and someone actually dropped it off in our mailbox we were so surprised they didn’t even need credit or validation they just did it just to be kind. Faith in humanity restored
😄
Improved his dating potential to 👈😏 good on you young fella , that’s being a MAN 👍🇦🇺
That young man for president
Good kiddo
What an amazing guy!!!
Cringe video every normal person does this sigh 🤦‍♂️
Please dont change boy, future need you 🙏
18 now, time for the real reward
how all chicanos should roll
Woulda just asked for some slop top
awesome story
aww hes cute too
- kid's straight up!!
That young man was not raised by Democrats
That's a great kid right there. Takes a purse back like no problem.
Support me Please
Mejo
How awesome!! Love to see it 😊
That was Beautiful more than proud of him what a Gorgeous Soul ❤
Aw, such a good dude.
Teach your children well and the world will be a better place.Good Job Mom and Dad!
this lil foo a law abiding citizen
"What goes around comes around" in life.....Words that I live by...
Did they actually give that money to kid?
The girl with black hair can get it any time 🥵 by the way good job kid!
Scripted
His parents raised him right!!
Yep this is world news now.
1 out of million
You can see in what a bad state this world is, when someone do something good and it is so rare that people want to give that someone money
Good values pays off! Do the right thing even when nobody is watching is excellent advice! 🇬🇧💜👍
naw he just returned it bc he saw the picture on the id and thought they was gonna let him tap
That is integrity
We need more people like him, If only we could all get along the world would be a peaceful place.
thumbs up 👍
Thank you so very much for posting this we see enough negative going on. It is so beautiful to see something so positive and wonderful still alive. Thank you so much for sharing. What a wonderful young man.
this kid has the best attitude and will get the best blessings in the near future and beyond
What a great young man with a great, honest heart.😊 Wow! And he didn't expect anything I'm return😮
Gta
I know why he brought it back but i won't ruin this moment 😂
How do I hire this kid?
Is that at Bakersfield or Palmdale?
I bet if y'all seen em in the streets you would judge em by the way he dresses not knowing he's a good kid.
Great to see a young man with family values.
He got some cheeks fasho
Not many people like him now days
Good on ya mate
Here is a boy to so extremely proud of. If only more people were of the same caliber, the world would be a more beautiful place. I’m very proud of you.
Integrity
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Bro seen she only had like 20 in the purse so he figured the reward would be more 😂 naw I’m just kidding that’s wassup we need more young men like this one
He wanted you, that's why he returned it.
he didnt needs 3k, he needs to get some milk
If this is a good guy, he needs a new look.
Hi Melina… I would like you to check your thyroid gland the next time you visit your doctor, by the way, it was very good story. Thank you for sharing it.
👍👍👍👍👍👍💯💯💯💯💯✨️✨️✨️✨️
Beautiful soul
Bro has drip
It’s sad that this seems to be such a rare thing, maybe it’s not, one can hope. Good young man either way.
God is Great!
He was prolly the one that stole it!! He certainly looks like a felon
there is video of cops finding lost purses, taking the money and stuff and throwing the purse in the trash can and keeping the money
That's a good kid returning someone's property he found! That happened to me once when I went out for a Run when I found a Cellphone and Wallet. I tried to find the owner, while waiting for the police to come pick it up, the phone kept ringing so I answered it and it was the guy who was looking for his phone and wallet. They were grateful that I did the right thing as well
Not all good deeds go rewarded i done a lot of good deeds and none i was rewarded i just get my stuff stolen
What an honest young man! I wish we could clone him!
Salute that young king! Dont lose that big heart
I showed my mom this and she didn't read it and thought it was a burglary and felt so and at the end
Keep seeking the ways of the LORD.
No I didn't know, of course you didn't
Good kid. Where's the video of him receiving the money?
🔥🔥🔥
If i were that guy, she 'd slap me right in the eye for sure.
Good for you, Adrian.
love this kid
Well done kiddo
Raised right
Bro was tryna hit lol, he seen her license
Just got some motivation to help people
Thug life
This happened to me a little while back & I wanted to repay the person but the person who handed it into the store didn’t leave a name & my whole rent money was in there & nothing was touched. Good people do exist
Aweeeeeee great man, and his mom’s advice shaped him well.
I honestly think he saw the DL and said damn this lady fine , ima return her purse  and see what’s up 😂
Someone did this for me when I lost my purse and was devastated. I was feeling so depressed of losing my ID and the only money I had at that time.  In my plead to the Lord, asking Him why..and that I couldn’t believe in a Lord that kept having things happen to me.  Well, that night I received a call from a young family that had found my purse in a grocery cart. I told them I could be there in the am to pick it up. They said no worries.  I got to then home..all were wonderful folks that invited me in. They told me they has to call their grandma bc she had kept the purse safe until they could find the owner.  When she came out, she looked exactly like my grandma that had previously passed away. I gave them what could offer and thanked them. I got in my car and THANK GOD AND TO PLS FORGIVE ME FOR MY CRUEL WORDS TOWARDS HIM.  Blessings to this young man for doing the right thing❤️🙏
This guy is very sweet and educated with the right values ❤ Hats off. 👏🏼
Thsts awesome Gid bkess his heart good dude love it!!!!
The only downside is that gofund me skims off the top, so if they raised 3000k, they saw 2300 of it , that's not a solid number but when did a gofundme , if someone gave me 100, I'd see 92.20 of it
Oh please…This was all a setup and they knew the kid (her nephew) they got their 15 minutes of fame.
God bless him… an EXAMPLE for others ! 😊
This young man is a beautiful person with a big heart,  and strong values. Its good to see in the younger generation. He is going places. Great job young man. 👏
Karma:  doing good things and good things will come your way 👌
When she said "for good reasons" and stopped herself from doing the citation sign with her fingers she probably thought that's why he did it. Involuntary or not I think he deserved a more proper 'thank you'
This young man was raised properly by his parents..
Love it, great job young man!
Alhamdulillah
Awesome
Is a 27 million view buy him a car or ?????. THIS IS HIS CHANNEL HEY GUY SUE THIS U TUBER IS 27 million view…
Good bless him! More people need to teach their children to be good people.
No
do unto others as you wish done to you: exhibit a
Yo good on him!!!!!!
I cannot stress enough, the importance of hearing about young people doing the right things! It's especially important when nobody is watching, 100%, Thank you Adrian. You deserve all the good you get.
Bro was just trying to get laid. Seen that ID and said damn, hell yeah
Or maybe he was lookin for a hook up, it’s a female purse and expansive ..
Good job, thank you kid. I've done this before a couple of times and a few of those times I've  been accused of stealing  their wallet or purse, nothing ever stuck once i started to talk with them.
He probably stole the purse
I found someones brand new iphone in a gas station bathroom and when they called it I met up with them to return it. They gave me $300 bucks. Always do the right thing!
Tell me why I thought he was central cee, what an awesome guy!
I new there was good kids out there. Your parents should be very proud. Great job buddy.
God son
😭😭😭😩🙌
Amazing if only all children were raised like him we would be so lucky 😊
ITS PROVE EDUCATION FROM THE BOY PARENTS ITS SO AMAZING
Right on !!!
Not all of our teenagers have the sense of entitlement.
"Hello, I stole this. Do you want it back?"
Intigrity is something that should be taught and practiced by all at all times. Good for you my friend the actions of a man.
❤
Too bad he did not remain  a good person.  This foo recently got locked up for trying to cross the border with meth and coke.
Family is everything
Eliana Martin looks stunning ;-)
Well done, this is why you never judge a book by its cover.
Well done on both parties.
I brought my son up to do things like this , it’s rare these days , I truly believe in karma
Ya stupid. He brang back the purse because they good looking he looked at the id. Probably only a little bit of money in there and he knew he would get a reward. Do he look like he dont steal or something.
I hope he took a finder's fee. Only fair.
Good boy
Cool
This just shows the importance of parental education!!! ❤
This is heartwarming. Onya kiddo!
Moma is def proud !!!
A result of good parenting.
Good work
Damn. I need some lost purses to find and bring back. It'll be my new side hustle.
Love the story.. Good kid..
I would have stayed and laid pipe like a plumber
That's what I mean people gotta appreciate anything is better them nothing
Just shows his mom taught him well and well done 💯💯💯💯
TDG FULLSUPPORT BIG FAX
The girl in the background 💀💀💀💀💀
good kid
This restores my faith in humanity
ngl 3k is crazy
That Young Man is going places!!! Good places.
This young man has a good heart.
That kid have a great future.
Visiting Cincinnati from Florida, I lost my wallet after an 1100 mile drive.. .   Someone found it , tracked me down in Facebook by my name on my drivers license (I had moved so the address was wrong) and returned it intact money still in it. They refused the reward, I told them to keep all the Cash, a few hundred, they mailed it to I me with the money still in it.
what is his ig?
👏👏👏👏👏👏
Wow...what a NERD!!!🤓
Starts at home with the parents. Good job
Love this.... good people make me happy.
Great integrity ❤
It’s because she’s bad
DO UNTO OTHER'S AS YOU WOULD WANT THEM DO TO YOU
This is how every teen should be raised.  Props to his mom for raising an outstanding young man
Honesty DOES pay off. Plain and simple.
That 5% of good society
Bravo my friend for your honesty,,happy the woman give you a big thank ,👍
Kudos to this young man👏🏽💯🙏🏽
After seeing shawties another form of payment would have worked 🤣
What an amazing kid. I’m tearing up.
Great job young man!👊
I did this same thing and I got robbed of my stuff the next day (true story) in Valencia Spain Nap Hostel. Karma doesn’t exist and everything is random.
❤
😅
My boy was hoping to get laid. Disappointed
Literally a side mission in GTA 5 but in real life instead
Good kid, that’s awesome
We need more young men like him.
❤
Now that's cool 😎
Damn good kid there!  Props to you young man!  And mom. great life principal to live by and teach this fine young man 👍🙏
Standing ovation for both the young man and his mom who clearly raised a man.
Love to see it. What a great kid.
There is hope
I am sure this young man is not WOKE
Great job my man!
Well done people all the way around 🙏 good to see
Funny how all these people give credit to mom dad friend coworkers ext. When Really God is the one that should get a the credit   Matthew 6:3-4 is almost word for word what him mom said to him
her roomate is bad
Aight people, new immoral way of making money found: Fake the video, get a go fund me, enjoy the unlimited money glitch.
Good deeds, paid off. Well raised  young man. Mom did  an excellent job. Gb
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
i raised you right adrian
RIGHT ON.
off topic but he fine
It's people like this that give us hope for humankind
Great job done young fella. Young Children like you make the world a better place. You and your mom should be very proud. I hope you keep on the right track and keep up the great work.👍👍👍👍💯💯💯🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷😄😄
Wow! I came across this video first thing on 1/1/2024. It really warmed my heart!! What a way to start my new year!! That's right! "Do the right thing even though no one is watching!"
This is a well rsised boy 🙏💙
1 in a Zillion Trillion chance... dont be fooled
am i only the one thinks there is a snake on the sidewalk or even in the grass
what an awesome thing to do both the kid and the family for doing the go fund me
💙
My man saw the I.D picture and was like DAAAM for sure gotta see if i can get a chance 😅😅😅
He is fine
This is what turns into a MAN we can ALL be proud of. Thank you son, much respect from an old combat MARINE. WELL DONE.
I think it's kind of sad that this sort of thing is treated as if it were a supererogatory act, when it ought to be a perfectly normal and expected act. It's like people think theft is the default position.
He robbed her and meth made him so paranoid that he returned the bag :))))
We made a "gofundme" and kept the money for it more like
❤
hes a good guy and fine😍😍
That a Great Job 👍🏽🎉🎉❤. Thank you, you raised a Great Son May God continue to Bless him for Life 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Such an honorable young man. We applaud your integrity.
This kid is made of the right stuff, and got rewarded for doing the right thing 😎👏🏽
Nice smart young man👍🇺🇸i
Keep those values young
Nah i need the aunt no cap😂😂😂
Good job mijo. If that was your mom or auntie’s purse they would have been so grateful too.
Now days people do good things just for views
Yes I’m glad she tipped him
Why am I crying bro
Can't tell you how many times I lost my wallet and nothing. And not gonna talk about how I lost my phone in a bathroom
Awesome ❤
I found a purse once in a shopping cart. I found the wallet inside of it and got the address and was gonna take it back.  But a cop driving through the lot saw me grab the purse and drive off with it and pulled  me over and arrested me for theft.
well there's one good millennial Well done.
Mothers have impact in their children lives.
I returned a phone once was given 60 quid
What a great young man!!!  👏
Aww your mom raised you well.God bless you and your family.
Looks like a G to
That's awesome! Not a lot of people this day in age could "be bothered" to go out of their way to return it! If they even returned it in the first place! Good for this young man!
I know I'm wrong for doing so but I  can also learn a lesson from it as well, but just me personally judging from appearances I would automatically assume this teen was more trouble than good but being so wrong in this case feels real nice. It's always heartwarming interacting with strangers and getting a glimpse of character & moral. It's nice to know alot of youth still have kindness in they're heart regardless of appearance
That's a good kid with a good future! Both parties big thumbs up
I'm surprised the teen did the right thing, even though he looked like a dangerous criminal, but that goes to show you, "don't judge a book by it's cover".
He tryna pipe
Amen 🙏
Maybe there's hope after all🤔
they 100% want him later on in life on som "ima save you for later" type shi
aw he’s a real one
❤
He said “my mom taught me to do right even when no one is watching” you go mama and son! ❤️
Not hope. Kid is one in a trillion. It won't happen again.
His mother and his father taught him the RIGHT Thing
$3000 for returning a purse some  girls high af forgot in a shopping cart. I wish that was my luck rn
So proud of you man God bless you and your family and may you continue to walk this way in life
He’s fine too😍
Great deeds for all people involved. The guy that actually drove to bring it back & the people who rewarded him for doing so, it helps to inspire others to do the right.
You just know he has amazing parents
Good for u Rodriguez...👽👍
💯💯💯
anybody notice how fine he is😅
Parenting done right.  We need more kids like this.
What a great story ..and a fine young man ..his parents must be very proud ..!
Well done young MAN
❤
Kudos for this gentleman.  One of my relatives did the opposite. Shame. Shame.😮
At least he earned enough for his amiibo collection.
Good job kid. Your parents should be proud of you.
The deal is, Christians would always return the purse without any second thought. It's the atheist that keep something like this.
Seems staged🤦🏾‍♂️💯
Good man
There is still some young adults who were raised properly and know how too do the right thing. Praise this young man for stepping up. The Good Lord saw what he did he will remember that day 🙏🏽❤️
Imagine He was the 1 who stole it & now got paid 3,700$ in return 😂😂
🥲That made me tear up.  I wish there were more young men and women like him
A very decent and considerate young man. He makes me feel proud of him as a young man.
Beautiful ❤❤❤
fine young man is crazy😭😭
He's a stand-up gentleman!
Now that is a good kid 🥹🥹🥹
Yeah always do the Right thing even when know one’s watching
Would be proud to be that kids Dad!!!!
This is so wholesome! 💙
3k dollars for returning a purse? wow
Awesome story. Way to go young man !!! Your mom should be very proud of you.
3k reward is very nice, both parts win something
He was raised right ,if only all kids now a days would be this way ,
He makes me want to tighten up my moral condition… I would Have judged that fella as a hoodlum…
Amazing young man and credit it to his mum
Nice to see a young man who's not a thug or punk. RESPECT
And he did it without expecting anything in return. A good kid. The only people expecting anything for him was the media.
We need more people like this
Good job young man👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Love this...🙏🏽💚
The young man'sparents should be very proud of him and also of themselvs
Dam they all want em
Such a nice story. The kid has integrity ❤.   Glad he was rewarded too.
"The kid was raised right", sure, but he's also wearing a gold chain. He doesn't need money in his life so it was extremely easy for him to act like this ;)
Something tells me the GoFund Me was the end goal here for the whole team, they wanted to scam others out of their money by saying look at this nice gentleman who returned a purse of all things and dressed like a gangster to sell the story even more.
❤
I used to push carts at target and did this once and the lady hugged me and wanted to give me money so bad but I didn’t accept and she nearly cried (my pfp is me when I was a cart attendant lol)
I hope he stays this pure, not Gonna be easy for a good kid in today's world  I wish him all things good.
The ladies did the right thing tracking him down as well. Karma works both ways. I found wallets a couple of times. One had 1700.00 in it. The other had 20. The one with twenty I dropped in a mail box. The one with the 1700.00 was picked up by the owners brother. The one with 20 in it had two sets of ID so seemed sketchy. I could have returned it to the wrong person so I let the mail figure it out.
Can we just take a second and appreciate how hot the aunt is ❤ ily auntie
I did this before and it went bad they accused me of stealing the money that was in the bag never taking will I do that again
Good looking young man , momma raised him well
Nobody wanted to see what I was doing when no one was watching when I was 17
I once found a credit card while on a walk. I found the owner from the phone book (yes, we used phone books back then). The owner came to my house, walked up to me and snatched the card from my hand and stalked to his truck and left. Not even a thank you. I was irritated for sure, but I'd do the same thing should I ever need to.
Good job parents
Don't tell the IRS and the Cali dept. of Revenue. They'll want $1200 of that $3000.
What an outstanding young man. His parent's should be very proud.
Honest integrity! ✌🏽🤙🏽🤛🏽
Notice how GOOD PARENTING results in decent human beings.
👏
"Fine Young Man Raised by Parents Right" wtf 💀
"Even when nobody's watching"  That's honesty, that's real. That's Jesus!❤😇
Integrity! It's a truly BEAUTIFUL THING!
Hell yea!
Dang wish that happened to me when I had did that for some guy he left his wallet at ATM and he was four cities away from me I drove to go and return it to him and all he did was tell me thank you
I needed this today.
Toxic womens
that kid was lookin for a wife
I didn’t know we get paid for doing the right thing
He hit the jackpot
I Love ❤ this!! A lady forgot her wallet in a taxi I was in & I returned it to her!! She hugged me so tight & kept thanking me… I’ll never forget that!!
What a kid
Nice guy
❤
Good 👍 kid.
Raised well and Well done to this young man 👍
Now that is one amazing young man. So proud of his honesty. What a great human being.
Cool
Good job kid! You raise well good. Kudos to parents too. Keep it up!
Oh she's definitely a Guyanese, that accent coming right out😭🤣
His parents must be proud. He was raised right.
Fantastic Story.  Principles before personalities,
Absolutely awesome ❤   Thank you to the parents and to the young man and the people who helped reward him
I moved to North Central Florida in 1999 and I always missed my home state California, I always tell people here how awesome California was when I grew up there in the 90s, or whatever reason here in the South, they always say bad stuff about California
Wow it was very generous for her husband to give him 3k
Bro is living in gta
there is hope
❤
Bravo for him and fortunate for the owner of the bag.  That this  young man was raised so right.
Bless his heart
Realistically his not broke, hence why he didn’t steal it
Cuddos to this young man for his maturity & honesty. Wish there were more young men like him. ❤
But CNN news never showing 😂this kind of good news, I guarantee!😂
My Mother and late Grandmother used to tell me this all the time growing up! Also, help people when you  can! You would want someone to help your loved ones!!
Do unto others- the basis of every Divine religion
Nice act
It’s a heart warming story for sure and a blessing that honest people do exist. Ladies (and gents too) next time use an Apple Airtag 😂 because not everyone is as honest as that angel of a man
hope?  one dudue aint near what society needs if ivery person commenting made 10 gestures of kindness in a month  MAYBE
Don't judge a book by its cover, he may dress like a thug, and he deserve a hug
Now he can buy a belt to keep his damn pants up
Aye, faith in humanity restored
HE FINEEEE
Great young man!
I scanned all of my items in Self Check Out. I'm proud of myself 👏🏾
bro was tryna smash
Great man. Well done bro
Not to ruin this but as a 32 year old man as a teen I would've been expecting to start my empire if I brought that money back 😂
Cool
I wish these stories were the ones everyone paid attention to! This happens all the time but the bad news is always what gets the most focus. So great to see!
honorable young man. I know if I was his mama I would be beaming with pride.
WHAT AN AWESOME YOUNG MAN
Great job young man, much respect !!! ✌️✌️🙏
....now he can go shopping and dress nice! 😎
I can say that I actually have hope for the youth again
heart at right place
I feel like the fact that this is big news seems bad
this kid reaally 17???? more mature then most 30+ or also politics but thats not hard to beat.
Yep we live in a world now we're just returning someone's stolen item makes national headlines
God has got something special installed for this young man 💯💯💯
Thats a good kid keep it up
Love!
I’ve handed in wallets I’ve found to the police station on 3 occasions. I wouldn’t do it again though because the police go through the wallet and document everything then get your contact information. Next time I’ll just give it to the nearest shop.
❤ Amazing young man with morals and integrity, obviously his mom taught him well. Delighted he was so well rewarded 🎉🎉🎉
Oh Man....I'm glad to see this because this young man is Rodriguez and glad that he did a good deed to show that. I hope it will help me because I am close to changing my last name which is Rodriguez (on my Father's side to my Mother's side which is Williams) due to not being hired for over a year after being laid off. The reason for that and believed because of "name discrimination" that the media portray a lot and make people hate (like the corporations to hire anybody)
I love this story. He has a good perspective on life and has consideration of others. We all have to co-exist with each other. Don't do it and expect a reward, do it because it is the right thing to do.
There's still hope to humanity
This is great but tbh it shouldn’t make the news. This is just basic decency and kindness.   And if someone else had found the purse and kept it, it would probably had been because they were in dire need of it and I’d be hard pressed to blame them.  A good social safety net equals less poverty equals acts like this being the norm. Let’s keep that in mind before hailing this decent young man as a hero — and when we go to the polls…
Good job everyone ❤🎉😊
Good man😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Wonderful!
It's always UPBRINGING by parents, how kids would grow in society, good or bad.
Now that's hope for us!
The family of this young man, I know there very proud, way too few and far between, God bless him!!!
That’s INTEGRITY. WELL DONE YOUNG MAN. God blesses you 🙏🏼♥️🙏🏼♥️🙏🏼♥️🙏🏼♥️🙏🏼
🙏🏾✝️💫
One time I found a wallet on the ground while biking, and it had 360$ bucks in there, plus the guys id and everything. Everyone was telling me to keep the money but I returned it and it was really fun and exciting. Although I didn't get a reward, I think I made his day when i gave the guy his wallet, and that's what's cool. Doing the right thing is always the best reward.
damn he fine
Did he smash them both after or whaaat????
One of the 3 I's of kurt angle.  Integrity
Mendez found Martinez bag and give to Lopez and Chavez was so  happy 😂😂😂😂😂😂
nice
He would have been lucky to get a blowy from one of those beauties...
A young man raised by a caring Mother!  Well done!!
She let him hit 😂
Its good to know there is still good people in this world
Momma raised him right! What a sweet kid.
Bro I've done this plenty of times, even gave back car keys after they were dropped unnoticed. Never was I offered anything for it. And now that I think about it I'm glad I wasn't.
I was in army and came home for weekend once and lost my wallet with everything in it including all my cash and a month went by and mail all came around they called my name and the mail I had was my wallet with an additional 100 dollars in it and a letter thanking me for my service.  No return address or name.
Good kid. Hope he makes it to where he wants to be in life
Being brought up with morals and integrity is one thing, this young man displayed them. What a beautiful soul. God bless him!
How fake
Doijng the right thing when no one is looking is the definition of integrity!🇺🇸🫡👍
So sweet I found a males wallet . And gave it back to him on ft Stewart ga.
Well done my man nice   UK 🇬🇧
Dude was trying to hit lmao
He wanted the kitty
This being news is crazy
Watching from Australia, wow, respect!!
I just made my 5 year old watch this, pausing to make sure he is understanding. There should be more content like this which im compelled to show my impressionable son. Definitely nlt Trump or any other political news. Vote blue.
Adrian you're a good man. Guys like you restore my faith in humanity.
👏🏽💯💯
That kid is going to be successful someday. That’s “Man” behavior. 👍😎
Going to be a GOODMAN! GREAT JOB!!
You see that’s a good man right there we need more people like him we need our generation to be fixed 😂
❤
Always do the right thing no matter what
Imagine if that women told him about Christ instead oh how many angels would rejoice
Yay. Good job, bless that teen.  More people should learn from him. ❤❤❤❤❤bless him
That guy is so honest I hope everything in life is good with him.god bless him and keep him safe.❤🎉❤
I put my phone on the store counter and a teenager just grabbed it and ran out. I hope he saw this video
This KID is so Cool and you ladies were amazing for getting him a reward.
Now THATS WHATS UP!
Mom did a great job
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Great man
That boy's got one BIG righteous heart! I'm going to guess that he also has one VERY proud momma right now!  God Bless you for rewarding his honesty and God bless him and his family!
That speaks volumes of his upbringing as well. Bravo to his mother 👏🏻
🫶🏾🙏🏾🤎
OMG a year later and this video still made me smile like the first time i watched it ❤ Good job for being a good person and doing the right thing
If only looks can kill, but not in this situation..... you bet this young lad was raised in a loving home with good morows, between Right and Wrong. Good jesters of love, respect and not the gangster wanna be look of what we see in our society today......as tough and brutal😮.
We really need more people like this not just in America, In all countries. Not many people would have returned that purse they would have just stolen it without thinking. This teen is what everyone should be like 👏👏
I have handed phone after phone back to owners and iv only ever got £5.00 . And it was the cheapest phone , I saved another persons career because all his work ids were in there and money . He gave me nothing at all being good is amazing , but why do people be so tight . I have always rewarded people who do the right thing , it's nice to see these beautiful people help another for helping them
This YOUNG MAN is exactly what we need in our Society. GOD BLESS YOU!
What a fine young man...I pray he has a happy and successful life ahead.
Nice I love it
If only the rest could take lessons from this young guy.
i mean thats great but having 0.01% of the population beeing legit good people doesnt mean there is hope for the new generation....
Glad someone showed that all teenagers aren't bad.
❤
I love stories like this so much. What a good man he is!
He doesn't look like the type that would take stuff out of the purse any way. He has a kind face.
Wow if I got $3000 for every time I did that, that would be nice. Kinda defeats the purpose of doing it though
You're to be commended,  your mom taught you well. Yessssssssssssss Babyyyyyyyyyyy always do the right thing if noone sees God sees❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I once left my wallet on top of my truck and it fell off in the neighborhood while i was driving away, and a young man brought it back to our house and returned it to me, with everything still in it. I will never forget it!
We must be more like him!
To all you young folks.. and possibly some old folks as well… this is the epitome of INTEGRITY.  good job kid… and mom and dad.  👏🏾 😊
She was scammed. 😂😂😂
Congratulations to the parents and the kid. Way to go, foo!
Great job dude!
I’ve had this vets medals for over 8 years I can’t find him on social media and I don’t want to hand it to someone that’ll forget or lose it. I bought this car back in 2014 (used) and kept it spotless. One afternoon a quarter got stuck in the slide rail for the seat so I had to take the entire seat out to fix it. There I found perfectly tucked between was what I thought was a wallet. Opened it and there was about 5 medals, dog tags, and a spent round. I want to be sure this man gets his belongings
Fantastic job young man 👍
"There's hope for our younger generation" - Melina Marquez  Well that aged horribly
Raised right ! Parents should be proud.
He’s an absolutely amazing young man . He was raised well by his parent / parent. May God continue to bless him.
God bless
Yup, do the right thing. So simple yet so hard to do.  A young with with integrity 🏖️
wow, just found out this was a work. they were related to the kid and they just wanted to nab money
Mom raised a good son 💯
Love seeing stuff like this!
Great kind 👌 young man❤❤❤.  Mom raised him well ❤❤
To😊o cute,  if I wasnt a broke mom/grandmother..i would of gave him money for sure.
there is hope for the future, great kid, his mother raised him right
If everybody was raised right like him, the world will be a better place to live.
Ingles sin barrera
That foo wanted to hit
This kindness, is what I would consider agape love!  More of US should be this kind!  Frfr
Great job.  😊Well Done.
What a good young man and a good inspiration for other teens.. hopefully he used the money for something good..
Wonderful.
We need more news story's about positive reinforcement, not shootings, Crimes and war....
Proud of you kid ! Not many people in the world who have their hearts set right when presented with such opportunity to benefit from. On 3 occasions I returned people their iphones and wallets, and they couldn't believe I'd go to so much hassle to do so. But I was more surprised by them being surprised. I learnt later people don't usually do that.
I drove to a persons house to return their lost purse, and I didn’t even got a thank you. Smh.
Good job god bless him
Very good job young man
good lad, well done for what you did !
Years ago, I found and returned lady's purse. With all documents, cards etc. inside. I spent time and effort to trace and find the person. The whole family came to pick it up. They tried to "reward" me with a movie ticket... Some people have no respect and dignity at all. I didn't do it for any reward... but their offer was absolutely embarrassing. Simple honest thank you would do much better. They didn't even bother to get off the truck. Another lesson. Some people simple don't deserve the effort.
🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
Gute Tat, keine Frage aber... mit seinem Bild nach ihm "öffentlich" suchen, finde ich schon hart
Right on bro!
That’s central cee mate
The hommies got CLASS!
Yk bro got to hit dat
(Just Cause) they drive a adui, I would have (Kept Driving).
Now would they had done dat if he was blk???
It depends how much there was in it😂
Love this!!
😊❤
Some what restored my faith in todays youth
His mama raised him right bless that family
thats a down ass foo right there
As a cadet in the JROTC, he did learned one of our core value which is Integrity Frst.
This is behavior that shouldn’t expect reward. We should all be doing this and following this young man’s behavior. In other countries this is a given. For Americans they feel differently, which needs to change. One reason I dislike America.
He'll make a great soldier
Stay that way man; don’t ever change your stripes.. good job!
Bro ended up on the news ......wasnt what he had in mind 😂
I mean he probably seen the cutie on the I.D card, why yall ain’t give him some oh yea?
What a good young man. Honestly is not often rewarded and I’m sure it won’t be frequently for him. But if he keeps up that attitude, it’ll continue to pay off through his life
They both gonna wait til he’s of legal age.
His mom raised him well. Good job mom!
Nice Kid - Hope someone sees this and gives him a good job - they won't regret it
Faith in young people restored. Good on that guy and good on his mom for teaching him right from wrong. So happy he’s gonna receive a reward for this, he deserves it for his integrity alone!
You all know what that kid was realling hoping for... seeing her ID he was probably trying to gather up the courage to make a move and try and get lucky for saving the day
Heart God shield him father cover him with your mighty hand may his flame never waiver may it always burn he is and is to be a light unto the world a world where many hearts will be as wax .and everywhere you go is danger thats the  world we live in today
Must have plenty money to blow.
I dont understand what's worth 3 k in that wallet lol
Good raza right here
Good kid. 👍
That’s awesome !
This is exactly when you raised a wonderful young man. That is not money wise, it is been raised by a wonderful family. That he is black, white, Chinese or whatever he had a wonderful Mother and family to look after him and that prove that color race or anything else does not matter..
Greta alternate ending
❤
this is the exact definition of “don’t judge a book by its cover.”
He come from good stock.
Good kid,he’ll go places for sure
Very refreshing to see. I lost my purse with $800 and ain't never seen it again 😢
Looks like a gangster can never judge a book bye it’s cover 💯
❤❤❤
Hope EVERYONE  reading  about  this , learns and emulates  this  That's  what it means to be  God  fearing ,  God sees and knows all things
That's nice
He a great kid cuz I would’ve kept it
Respect!!!
👍🙋🏻‍♀️
HOPEEEEEEEEEEEEE
A lot of people see us teenagers as cold people, this really shows how thoigh we don’t always make the right choices many of us still have big hearts.
I first thought he was simply handed $3,000 for his good deed, and rather thought, well...  that's a lot... seemed less about appreciation and more about a cavalier attitude toward money.    But upon learning, so many contributed to reward his good deed, well...  that was really cool.  I'm sure he'll put the money to good use, he seems a great level-headed young man.
He's kinda...
That right there is a boy who will become a great man
GTA 5 random event
If that was a black kid,he would've kept the purse,then showed up later that night to the house with 5 of his friends 😱😂😂
My brother lost a wallet with like 200 dollars at Silverwood, never saw it again 😂 so this woman is very lucky, and this dude is respectable
Nice setup to get donors for cash. That was clearly a staged project by that family, even a decent cop can see that.
He saw that ID and wanted them cheeks
I once went out of my way getting a dropped wallet back to a lady the reaction I got was taking wallet from me, she checked for her cash and cards and said oh it is all here, looked at me barely smiled and walked away without even a thank you
Wow I thought that honesty was dead
Yeah this is awesome, good kid.
I wondered did he recite credit card numbers before he returned it
Exactly why u can't judge a book by its cover
Nice guy bringing back a lost purse. With good heart love it!
❤❤❤❤
There's hope. This is how everyone should act, and be raised.
This is great but $3000 is a little extra, that could be donated to a cause that needs more help
God bless this young man.
Go Adrian🎉
Would he have done it for an average male in his 50s
He was the one that took it in the first place, and he gets rewarded.....????
Perfect example of the fact that if you do good things, you get good things in return. It just doesn't happen right away most of the time, but it WILL happen. :)
Turns out he stole it 😂
What’s your aunts @
Bigger than all, he did it without expecting to get paid for doing it.
An example of " don't judge a book by it's cover"  Good mom, too.
17 yrs old!! Great job mama.
U can tell he was raised right<3💗💗💗
💪👏👏👏👏👏👏
Hello
Great video that really cool
Oh wow that's awesome
Sure "lost" he probably stole it and then felt bad and returned it without the wallet
lowk he look..
He probably stole it
That's indeed a great kid, yet I wished we lived in a world where this was just a normal kid doing what everyone would do.
Good job dude
One time two teens came to my door and handed me my purse, which I had left in a Chinese restaurant and didn’t even realize until then. I gave them all the money in my wallet and said, “Would have been gone either way if you hadn’t returned it! You saved me a lot of heartache trying to replace all my lost information.”
The fact this made the news just shows what a terrible world we currently live in. Its so uncommon for someone to do something nice that it happens and gets on TV?!
She called the news because someone returned a purse.
I wonder what was inside the bag Im 100% no one would return it if it had 3k usd inside it probably
The amount or Detail Rockstar Puts in the game is Insane!❗
Do good and good will come back to you
The real gangster that’s so cool
There has always been "hope" for the next generation, its called good parenting, and that young man's parents did a good job.
i thought go fund me was only for people in need.
Great job man!
He took it, then returned it, and waited with hand out for the Reward.   Smart kid...  how to make money!  Take purses and return them for the reward.
My mum lost her phone yesterday and so we found a Facebook group today where a lady posted a photo of the phone and she wants to return it to us. My mum bought a big box of chocolates for her so when the lady returns it we can give it to her. ❤
I hope he finds himself a really lovely girl to marry and live happily ever after!
Good child
moms 💀
Dhar mann type sh- 💀
Discount Central Cee.... Central GCSE
Now that's a teen brought up right
and they say good deeds don't pay off
This fella is just what we can use in our society. Great job buddy. It’s really hard to see such good people around.
Bruhh
did yall make sure he got paid?
Nobody cares🙄 it's not that serious yall hype up anything in this stupid country he returned a purse big whoop lots of people do 🙄
That's awesome❤ Good Teachings❤ !! God bless him ❤,
Man this kids brings back lost purses that's awesome, my truck was broken into yesterday n my wallet stolen just yesterday by the oppite minded person of this kid . People suck but people can also be awesome
It's sad a little people think their child's good or bad deeds always stem from how their parents raised them. Which isnt always true so give the guy his own individuality I'm sure he learned himself being nicer is better than being evil
what a nice lad he deserves a reward. most kids these days would keep the purse.
I am Shure 99% the guys here in the comments do not do this 😂😂
Good dude right there.
"theres hope for a younger generation" acting like the older generation is anything better..
Imagine getting money for your deed from a ‘charity’ found 🤣💀
People in the real life be afraid of him ! And look this kids ! Peace to him! Racism kill people's heart ❤
Good DUde. !
i bet he was hoping for something else😅
na theres no hope hes the one that stole it jk but still no hope for these kids and parents ruining them
Good boy! Excuse me, Good man!! Good job Mom!!! God Bless you!!
that nice but just remember be a good person  but don't be naive because that how you get played
But theres no hope for younger women, theyr so promiscuous.
Sweet, hopefully he buys himself something awesome!
This boy was raised Correctly by his momma. I found a checkbook 1 time when I was shopping. I just called the # on the check n met the lady back at the grocery store where I found it. Pretty good.
I’d wanna return her purse to I bet she did receive it
Repeal the 19th..
He saw she was a bit of a baddie so took his chances 😂
I did this once but I'm not coming from a good family nor great parents, why does it always parents get the credit for something like this?
Bravo!   I'm pleased to say that everyone I know would have also returned the purse!
Fake
Plus, he had to stand there holding a purse that didn't even match his shoes.
I told sig that a few days ago and she said it to me yesterday she’s to when no one’s looking but I seen him b4
he just wanna tap
bro just did a side quest 💀💀💀💀💀💀
Yinleon
may God bless this man, Amen !!
Thats awesome man. Good job
Ofcourse women without common sense lol who leaves a big ash purse in a cart
Whenever I see videos like this, I realize there's still a bit of hope left for humanity. Being kind goes a long way.
Adrian and his mum: real values at work. God bless them and that woman.
Amazing! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
How is this surprising? This is normal in my country.
When it  was a dude than the perse never gonna be back hahahah he look to the photo he think damn girl i wanna see you❤ hahahah
he fine asf LMFAO
So in the future, have a friend steal a purse, then you go and return it for casheesh. Lol😂
Lucky dudw
ts did not need a news story lmao
This is how you set an example. This is so amazing to hear. God is great! This is where God shines through! I’m so glad he was rewarded as well.
Plot twist.. he’s the one who stole it
Actually, it’s a normal behavior in Japan. But, many bring the things they pick up to the police station though. Anyway, good job, dude!!
This kid pounded me in an alleyway once
he looks like faze rug
😂 blud has my name
Bros a G
God bless his heart! Buddy you did a great thing man keep doing the right thing things will always turn out good for you. Your parents definitely raised you to be a great young man.
What a wonderful kid parents must be very proud ❤️❤️
Most people in the non Western world would do this. Going like it's amazing
10-01
I lost all my codes again
Code 3 For reals?
He looked like he was scoping the house out
His mom raised him right! Well done to him and mom.
love it
This kid is a needle in a haystack, props to him.
Damn the aunt is a baddie fr fr
Plot twist: He stole it and returned it
I always thaught it was Martin who did that
Ok let’s hope so
How sober me would of thaught
wtf gil
good cholo
but they didnt give him money the guys that donated give him.
He completed his side quest
I sure hope the kid got the whole 3.7k....
Don't judge a book by its cover.
i do have to say this is good and all but it should be the basic, the normal and how everyone acts, respectfully and using initiative, the fact they even rewarded him for it shows their gratefulness and the suprise because this isnt expected in this day and age what is expected is for it to be stolen and used to their own benefit bank cards etc,
And yet that kid looks like a kid who lives on the streets, that kid is so sweet.
I remember in high school my sis and I was driving and found a metal clipboard box on the road, we picked it up before it would be run over, it had important documents of import goods, it was for cigerettes, cigars, alcohol, it had a drivers license, found him in the phone book and called him up, he offered a few cartons of cigerettes and liquor, but I was only 16, he was close to getting terminated and investigated on. It was just a few days before christmas. He offered some cash, but I never went to meet him.
he's cute
luckiest man on earth
“My mom always told me to do good things for people while other people aren’t looking”
That is awesome!  good thing deeds make the heart feel happy! Its a good quality to have. I am sure he will help someone in his family or further his education with the financial gift. Its a blessing to everyone to see honesty in a young man.
The kid is good he kinda look likes a thug but good job man
Extremely expensive hermes purse I would've had to get my money's worth Lmao
Wow there is hope in humanity
He would have gotten more from a pawn shop. That was a Hermes purse. VERY expensive.
How about good job dad?   Good parents raised a good young man.
May God bless you all
Hope In humanity has been restored
I was walking home when I was in the 7th grade and when I was crossing the grass in front of the building next door I saw a purse and all it's contents just strewn all over, like there was a trail of stuff leading to the purse, I saw it, kept walking, stopped, walked back, started walking, stopped, walked back, I wasn't sure what to do, do I just leave it, or do I pick it up, so I picked it up, grabbed all the stuff that was laying on the ground, I'm talking like everything, napkins, toothpicks, everything, and I took it home. I guess I could have just walked back to school but that didn't even cross my mind, I thought I'd take it home and figure out who it belonged to. So we did, my grandfather looked inside, found the address, and we went to the house which was 1968 Foxworthy Ave in San Jose, I still remember that because that's the year I was born, so it wasn't too hard to remember, but we knocked on the door, she opened it, was totally shocked that this fat 12 year old was standing there holding her purse, she told  my grandfather that it had been stolen off the back of her chair, I gave it back to her and she was like, "hold on a minute, I'll be right back" she came back and gave me a five dollar bill, I still feel guilty about taking it to this day, and that was in 1981, but I should have just gave it to her, said "no, that's ok" to the money and walk away, instead I took it and I still remember saying to myself, "that's it?" I still laugh at the memory.
He is truly an amazing person. ♥️🫶 a person would be lucky to have him in your life. 🙏
Thank you PESO PLUMA for returning the Purse 🙏🏼
damn nd he fine too
She has a thyroid enlargement
Great people initialing think like he did. Wonderful story.
one time a lady lost a sentimental earring in the pool we were swimming in. so I used my ability to hold my breath long periods and went down and recovered it for her. she wanted to give me like 200 bucks for doing so but I declined stating the deed was its own reward
He's so fine
I mean if everyone gave those kind of rewards (which is the right thing, otherwise then stealing it is 100% right, even morally speaking) I’m positive most purses would be returned
Anyone who doesn’t give that purse back is a criminal, simple as that. Fair play buddy but logically everyone, kid or not, should be behaving exactly like that it’s the standard of living we expect in society. I would still like to praise that kid for setting the standard for everyone else to follow
he stole it and give it back for 3k the best way to wash money
This is norm behavior for most San Diegans. Good job.
They’re too happy talking about him, I think they give him another “reward” instead of the 3k dollars 😏
good job❤❤❤
As nice as it is that he was rewarded for his good act. It is sad that we’ve come to a point in our society that just doing a good deed can be news worthy and people just throwing money for their act. It should be human nature to be a kind soul and just being a Good Samaritan
Normal behavior here in Japan.
He definitely saw the photo of the girl on the ID and thought "heres my chance" and was hoping shed be extra grateful
Bless him
He jstd wanted the reward
his homie stole it and he was like nah we dont bang like that
He wanted some cheeks
Well deserved,great job kiddo
What a kind person, i wish him the best in life
This was very good of him. Note that lots of people including police say do not return items, turn it into the business instead. But, you never know what will happen to it after you turn it in, maybe the business is not honest or whatever. It is really better to return it yourself to the owner if you want to be sure it gets done.
And he’s fine!!!! 😍😍😍
Hes got integrity man of god
He difinitly doesnt need anything thats why he returned it
Wow this is news.. free Palestine ya fckn sheeple clowns
He returned it cause she was a god dam smoke show XD
Ladies this kid is the man you want to husb up
That’s good character
Good boy 🧒
central  cee
Hes dripy too
i lost my wallet at the beach. someone was kind enough to put it up by the lifeguard tower, this was at or after sunset....i drove back to La Jolla to look for it and found it. they only took my IKEA gift card, but left therest...there was no cash...
Good Boy raised by Good Parents ❤❤😊😊
Good things happen when you do good things.  The $3000 was a nice gesture.
plot twist: he's the one who stole it in the first place
I am just a 14
Yk that kid don’t need the funds he got hella chains on already
when nobody is watching is actually when everyone is watching, good job kid.
My friend and I found a purse in a busy parking lot strapped into a shopping cart! I looked inside the purse to find an ID, this young lady had cash, her phone, medical cards, etc. we called inside the store to ask if anyone was looking for it and there wasn’t, then we went to her house and waited for her as she was out looking for her purse. When she pulled into her driveway and got out of her car she was in tears! I handed her purse back to her and the look of relief on her face was payment enough! We never thought of taking anything and we were happy to have been able to do that!
people do this in India, we get 0.125 dollar
So he returned a purse ,I've returned several wallets and  phones too, But I've never received any praise.
Keep the 3k let me clap the cheeks
Central Cee doing side quests bruh
I found a pt cruiser car key at my local skate park, wasn't weathered so I figured I'd spend the day skating around trying to beep any p.t. in my small town till I found the one. As I'm leaving the skate park and going down the road I see an old lady pull into the park in a p.t. turn around and wait till she goes to park. As she getting out I clicked the lock button four times and she jumped. I yelled "hey I found your keys in the grass" turns out she was looking for week for them and was gonna just give up and buy a new spare. Didn't get anything but brownie points but that's all I was expecting either way.
I’ll do the same thing just to see the baddies 😅
The lesson: be as anonymous as possible when returning things so it won't be made a spectacle.
good samaritan rizz
Meanwhile my partner was in the hospital and sick all year but we could barely raise any money with our gofundme. This kid does what any decent person is supposed to do and gets $3K. Happy for him but sad for me.
*"always treat others, like you want to be treated yourself"!*
“Fine young man”..
Can’t judge a book by its cover
I wish parents would raise this generation and have them come out like this amazing young man and stays out of trouble
Adrien Has A Bright Future Amongst The Brotherhood of Mankind ,,, you Go My good Man !! Dont let this World change U ,you Change it !!!
Hope this guy is still doing the GOOD!!
IS THAT A TELFAR
Dressed like that I would've thought he was trynna rob my house
central cee
When ppl talk about generations as if each one isnt guilty of genocides lol
This young man stepped up to the plate and hit a home run.     Hopefully, his good will,  will influence other young persons to do the same.    Maybe he can apply that money for a good start to college.      I wish him a great life.
We still have some great young people around. Thank you for doing the right thing.😂😊
If they single bro fursure 🧢
Congratulations young man! Really proud of you !👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Nice job.. well deserved. ❤❤❤
Funny how something that should be normal is glorified.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Good job to his parents.
Amen!!
I do believe some could steal and give back because of award, was there an award he knew about and if he didn't know, he's a good one.
The definition of “Integrity” is doing the right thing even when no one is watching.   That’s exactly what I tell my son all the time!
Ive returned a wallet with all the money in it. Cant help it, im honest
As nice as it is/was, I think that I would still prefer to turn it over to the Police.   Coming to someone's door could be risky if the person thinks you stole it or something alone those lines
Love his ethics!
That's a nice pound of ganja😂 I meant good kid 💀 he was right! 👍
Thats awesome!
All about the parents raising thier kids right.
Good young man.
she didnt give him anything at 1st she took purse sad thank you it wasnt tell it went viral he got something she lying
the lady didnt give him anything in originsal vid
I have a niece that is really pretty and smart and is in the 12th grade on her to college to be a Doctor. They would make a real cute couple. She also has that integrity thing in her DNA. Could you imagine the babies they would make? Just little geniuses.
There ya go kids thats a role model, well done Sir its good to see good things happening to good people, shout out to the young ladies and their family and friends.
Great parenting
mhm he’s fine asf
Hggg
Hh
I think $3,000 is over the budget.
I LOVE THIS!!!! THANK GOD FOR THIS YOUNG MAN!!!!🥰🙌🙏💖💞
Ok but a 17 year old driving an Audi does not need 3k
amazing ❤
Eye shoulda been me
Ive returned 3 purses before and I got yelled at and accused everytime. Didnt even get a thank you
This is great and all, but I hope the lesson isn't that good deeds must always be rewarded handsomely
Thank you for giving the world more hope❤
❤🎉
A great kid but also great parents must have raised him!
Bet the kid stole it and his mum talked him into returning it lol
Thanks mummie for being such an inspiration to this young man,God bless you
good is scarce
What a great young man !!! Awesome
Remind me my kidS very good heart young man 😘😘
And by the way, he dresses people would assume he’s rude and would probably steal the purse but in fact, he did the complete opposite. This is proof that You should never judge a book by its cover, because it could be the sweetest thing
Adrian mexican power❤
Theres hope.. im raising my 2 boys and 1 girl just like his mother raised him.. moms we gotta follow that save our kids future!
ahh so this is what they call gap moe in japan. I get it.
❤
Now that was some good parenting from his parents. God bless them.
Giving a good name to la raza, proud of you homie✊
What a lovely young man. Well done to his parents for raising him right x
This teen has a huge heart and I hope good things come his way.
HES FINE AS HELLLL OMG DADA
He amazing,
Shout out to the friend reminding her friend that the Samaritan deserves a reward.
GO FUND ME WAS NOT MEANT FOR THIS KIND OF STUFF. GO TO YOUR NEIGHBORS AND COLLECT BUT DONT USE GO FUND ME.
17 years old and I'm shocked that he is a good kid in 2023. There's hope for us yet 🙏
Wow kudos to him. Momma raise him right.  But damn he got 3k jsut returning that. I’ve been returning purses, wallets all my life and all I got was a thank you. lol
Bro was a good dude

Too cool.❤❤❤❤
What a great kid! Kiddos to his mom!

Their ring seems to be a piano
Wow that’s the beautiful expression of karma ❤ I hope I raise my kids to be this good.
Thats how kids gotta be taught. Good job to his mom.

“Do the right thing, even when no.ones watching.” 💖

He definitely hit

How cute they bought him followers 😂😆 even trade I guess
Smh 🤦‍♂️
My boy bought hella pro clubs and za  wit da money 😂
Great young man.
I was dashing and this guy wanted a heating pad for his wife who just got out of surgery. Store didn't have it, so I drove to my house to grab a new one I had just gotten, and left it at the door. All together I drove 28 miles.. I feel like pathetic tooting 😂but damn I wish I got 3k for what I did!  I would have driven that purse back in a second, good on that kid 100% 🙌, but people SHOULD be this kind. Kinda crazy how the small stuff can make hero's out of people doing what should be done.
I found a woman's wallet once. It had her id in it. I mailed it to her.
“Fine young man raised by parents right” 😂
❤❤❤
For future parents tell that quote to your kid monthly so you will never forget it
he so fine whas his @
these kind deeds matters so much :)
Nice job Adrian!
One time i lost my wallet on a road trip to Redwoods. Turns out someone later on found it out in the woods and somehow called my dad to get my address so that they could ship it to me. It arrived with everything still inside, thankful for those honest people.
Was there money in the purse? I wonder if he would have returned it if there was thousands of dollars in it. I like to think so. Who knows.
In a related story FEDS raid home of 17 year old for not filling out the proper 1099 tax form
🤜🏼⚡️❤️⚡️🤛🏼
so where is the money now 😂
Crazy thing is if you search up the gofundme page (no longer available) you’ll find articles about it. Apparently he received about 23k
I bet he is Asian
That's is awesome
Integrity. Parenting level = God mode. 👏
I returned someone's wallet with $5000k in it and it took me 2 hours to find him during my shift as a driver because he was a visitor to our state and he wasn't answering his mobile as the number was in his wallet with his business card.  I got Nothing from him but he didn't even know he lost his wallet because he was drunk.  I knew where I dropped him off but it was at a hotel.   He came out and the first thing was he went through his wallet to make sure his money was all there and turned around and left me standing there with No Thanks or anything.  A thanks would have been nice.  I really needed the money during the 2 hours I lost and I kicked myself as I should have handed it to the police and I wouldn't have lost 2 hours of earning money.  laughing.  The second time I found a wallet the guy said he had no money and I gave him a free ride.  He had hundreds of dollars in his wallet.  I gave it to my boss to find him at the end of my shift as he got off at a bus stop.    If it happens again?  Well, it won't as I am not driving anymore and I can't afford to go shopping these days. I try to grow my own stuff and buy once every blue moon and buy in bulk when I can.
👏👏👏
W rizz
I can  think of  a  reward 😅
THIS HANDSOME KIND MAN IS RAISED RIGHT LOVE YOU MAN
They didn't reward him and asking others to reward him thru GoFundMe???
Classic Adrian move
Man was tryna smash but got money instead.. what a W
Thanks something good.
shudve been rewarded with the gawk gawk
good yute
The news should also give him reward as good trophy for good behavior 😊
blud js wanna have milfs
🫡
Hes cute
I know how this story ends
HES SO FINEEEEEE😻😻🤭🤭🙏🙏🧎‍♀️🧎‍♀️
Why did I think her name was Melanie martiniez 😂
Good kid stand up guy .
There is no hope at all
Im 17 and i would definitely help a lady lost purse
Need more guys like him
It was all planned he stole it and gave it back for free money come on now lol
This is a real G
He’s so fineeee
I’ll say it again. Never judge a book by its cover.
Good kid
I did this once and the people took the purse and shut the door in my face and I didn’t get squat lol
the latin Central Cee
Milfs
Shout out to his parent(s), they obviously raised this man properly.
Is this such a praiseworthy episode? If it were in my country, I'd just give it to the person or take it to the police station and that would be the end of it
What a happy ending.🎉😊
Yea I used to do that as a hustle, or someone's cat, Yea I found to cat, 😅😅😅
this is exactly what i’d do if i ever found someone’s belongings
Goes to show what a messed up world we live in when just returning someones property to them gets 25 million views. This should be expected not an extraordinary event.
Good deed central cee
slim shady the good samaritan
Bro smashed
Bro it’s obviously a simple setup. Kids friends stole the purse so when he gave it back he could 1. Get her number or 2. Get a better reward than what is inside the purse
by your outfit i really hope its just a phase because the real world need you
Now that's gangsta
That's good news right there , we need to spread more positivity news around the world instead news that is bad
That dude is family now
Hopefully he didn’t just go out and buy a couple of pounds of weed with that money
This story is not even real. This is a complete and utter fabrication. As in this is never happened and was concocted for the camera.
Good kid
Shady looking  creep returns purse
Bro did a side quest. Got a nice reward.
Ew they both look disgusting
I know exactly situation
Plot twist: they were all in on it haha
I don’t give a 🤬
It’s so easy to presumptuously judge him because of his attire. God bless you young man.
You’re the man dude, don’t ever forget that!
little do they know he stole it to begin with lol. Good guy
Yooo bro saw what she looked like and said  "yea ima good Samaritan 😈"
real g
ok but he's so fine 😭
In all reality, he thought the girl on the license was hot.
hes my friens cousin
Awe, that kid deserves so much more! His parents did right by him.
yaa.... no there is still not much hope for this generation...there will always be good kids in every generation but there will be less and less of them
When the lady straight up said," There's hope for our generation!!" I was like," Theres hope?!"
Yo bro can I borrow $1,000
Your not special us Hispanics just stick with each other
this guy is now a millionaire at 20 after returning 100 purses every week.
If that was me il do the same thing 😂😂
bro, they all family it’s all a set up now they have $4,000 for free plus a good look on everyone’s part
he fone
Yes, good job parents raising that young man he will be a good officer bring some dignity to the force again
Saw a movie where a lady intentionally leaves her purse in public so the victim will bring it back to her then i think one girl saw the amount of purses she had in her house when she returned the purse she found and i think the lady tried to kill her or at least stalk her creepily,she wanted something from her can’t remember what, didn’t watch the whole movie but the purse in here looks almost the same 😂
Good kid and his parents have to be proud the got a raise a good kid go bless
respectful       mans kinda fine too😥
I can say with extreme confidence that my son would've done the same. Im proud of this young man on the video. Someone raised him right 😊💯👍
Good job kid
$20? Crazy world
He definitely just wanted to clap them butt cheeks I can tell seen that Id was like On my way!
Amazing
Ohh it was like Raj Koothrapali returning a lost drone to a woman
damn he kinda fine tho😮‍💨
hes so fine dayum.
This is proof of “do good and good will come back to you”
Good for him most dudes his age would not do that no hate to anyone his age❤
Much Respect. Much Love To The Rodriguez Family.
Great job!!!!❣
He just wanted to be involved in the scissoring
he’s fine too

Good to see this story, hopefully our world sees more of these good deeds
Very good story
Bruh bouta get a real chain lol
Did similar in the past and barely got a thank you from owner of purse..
great mother. raised this young man right. getting harder and harder to come by these days
Ngl i was going by don’t judge a book by its cover bc at first glance I read the title as “kid steals woman’s lost purse” instantly
Why he so fineee lfmaoo
bro completed a side quest
👍
A real gangsta
Dang, I found full purse in Walmart cart in parking lot. It was open. And full of stuff. Pocketbook. And things. Turned it in.
what a good kid.
Doing the right thing shouldn't be rewarded it should be the norm
His parents raised him right ❤
good
Hahaha melina marquez gdzie ona żyje na melinie xddd
Wow a blessing!!!
HE LOOKS LIKE MY EX AND HIS NAME IS ADRIAN BUT HIS LAST NAME IS REYES
He’s kinda fine ngl
Good kid❤❤❤
I hate when people do nice things those people can eat the witch Voortrekker 😢😢😮😢🎉😮
Good job, young man. Always do the right thing.🇨🇦🇺🇸
we do that on daily basis as Muslims...
Young man was raised right 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Props to him, but back in the old days you wouldn’t get a reward for that because it’s supposed to be common courtesy. (I’m gen Z)
The good simpmeritan 😌💅
That's a real man right there
The apple doesn’t fall too far from the tree. A young man with integrity and self-respect
good kid.
❤❤❤🙏🏻
If Donald Trump found that, he will hide that in Mar-a-Lago.
I woulda gave them cards to my good scamming man
All it takes is one act of kindness and it can go along way
Buddy was the one who stole it💀
He’s kinda 🤭🤭
We need more people like him
Wow!  So proud of this young man and much respect to his awesome mother for raising such a great son.
My dream is living in a world where this is not newsworthy, but in the meantime, let's keep encouraging it. Absolute legend of a man, eternal respect for this.
I might need return some lost next time I see it
Well done young man God Bless ❤
so they didn't personally take their own money and give it to him its was other people and it was more than 3K so they kept the remains
I knew I should've returned the $5000 I found in the subway, but I didn't!
Great young man❤
This is fake no hispanic gives 3000 dollar tip
I didn’t know this is how Central Cee kickstarted his career
Amen
So funny this made the news in America
Remember Greta Movie. 😭 Don't ended up like that!
Hope he reported that to the IRS. I’d hate to have to report him for tax evasion 😔
Good Boy, guys, we must be like him everyday.
Way to go young man! May GOD protect you, and keep you! Respect to each of the individuals who helped to raise money to show him gratitude ❤
The sad part is,if he was walking on foot,to return the bag & the police saw him, he'd immediately be the bad guy & potentially end up getting arrested or something stupid, even though we know better,but good on you mate,there's still hope for the adults of tomorrow. 🙏❤
Bro did not let the intrusive thoughts wins
What’s his ig @🤭🤭
i wouldve stolen it 💀
Someone please tell me why I think Eliana Martin looks like AzzyLand
Now foo is gonna buy Mario carts and modelos
Nice people, all of them seem 😄, good is still out there x,
thats exactly right always do whats right even when no ones watching
I remember one day like in I wanna say 2018-2019 I found a Raider’s wallet in a parking lot of a 7-Eleven and I as soon as I realized it was a wallet I immediately closed it back because I thought I was violating some guy’s bubble because I through his wallet and I gave it to the Manager of the 7-Eleven and he said “Don’t worry we’ll give it to him when he comes back.”. They ended up giving it to the police a week later because the owner didn’t show up. Everybody who was there said I did a good thing except my sister who said “Keep the cash and then return it and when he asks about the cash say “Your punishment for losing your wallet.””.
Very cool kid💜
He didn't want to be black.
Boy need to learn how to wear pants properly
❤️❤️❤️
Thank Goodness for the large reward. Imagine how it could've been only $20?
Well done young man!! 👍🏻👍🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Never judge a book by it's cover.
Is that central fucken C
Was there money in the purse? Lol
Its illegal to not have your drivers license address up to date
She’s 🔥
Shout out to this kid but really we don't all live in the same world, that attitude would be normal in countries like japan or korea
This guy is a smart young man that’s going to have a successful, bright future 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Reality check: There was nothing valuable in the purse, can't use credit cards because it's traceable. So big brain kicked in and he returned it hoping for a reward instead. Kid made out right!  Integrity by mistake!
❤🙏🙏🙏 great advice Do the right thing
His parents taught him respect for others. Good job to his folks and good for you young man.
If everyone in the world was like this? Wow.. Can you imagine? I can dream..
He got more than what he would’ve got in the purse. Smarter than a thief and a Good Samaritan at the same time.
Thought that was central cee
Dam the mom ❤😮😍
God bless this young man. It does give you hope. Praise God
But I want to hear from.the guy! Great story
Way to snitch on the kid, now hes gonna have to pay the irs
The right upbringing.
Crazy that you make it on the news for just doing a good deed that anybody should do these days
He’s so fine
God Bless him💚
Plot twist: the guy who returned it was the guy who stole it
Ohhh i saw your panty in the parking lot.. Then gave 3k to keep his mouth shut since she was cheating 😂😂
To me, being an european in germany, this video is kind of disturbing. You're making a big deal out of this, that a person returned a lost-and-found purse to its original owner? Seriously? You think that's extraordinary? In europe we call that normality. Edit: fixed a typo.
That's what I'm talking a kid raised the right way in the tough streets and suburbs of La
"If it happened to me" not many people think like that anymore
Ive pulled a man from a burning car saved his life. Received not even a Thank you. Kid returns a damn purse and gets 3k the world we live in i swear is so bavkwards.
Imagine If the women just kept the raised money 😂
Looks like Central cee
If there was cash in that purse you wouldn’t have got it back
LMAO 17?? why does he look like he's in his early 20's 😂😂
So deserving of high praise. Character.
That’s awesome
That's great that he did that, and it's great that they raised that money for him. Personally I'd donate the money to a local Women's shelter, I don't need to get paid for doing the right thing.
he’s gonna have a year of good karma after this
God bless him and him parents , he deserved it ,  and he had one of the best lessons of him life , be honnest, walking in right way , and god open u a door ❤ and this door give him a gift at 3k and maybe those familly needed it and it was just gift from God 😊 buy happy to see that
What a good young man.
With so many negative stories about young people, this is so grest to see!
the empty purse probably worth $3k
I’m not trying to assume or anything but judging by the way he’s dressing he probably gave it back because there was no money inside
A black gonna see this and try to do the same for clout chase and use it to make them look like they do shii...😂😂 watch
I did this last week, didn’t get a single piece of money
Jesus loves you!😊❤ All so very much.
That kid is so nice and kind
very nice God bless you all.👍🙏🤲
This is the type of guy who needs to in law enforcement.
You made your mother very happy. Good job!
Mad respect lil bro!
I'll be the one will be returning it to you guys next time 😎
You could of both gave the guy some top
There is hope yet.. god bless little brotha
Crazy too cause even I was like he look like a mf to steal it lmao
There’s is not a lot of people like this kid
yeah right
Fake
❤❤
Hé was raised right!!
how did he find her tho?
adrian kindaa…
It doesn't cost anything, to try and be a good person.
Scripted.
Looks like her son
Shout out to the idiots who think this wasn’t staged
good boy
Kudos to the kid. But also kinda sad that we have to celebrate common courtesy, good manners and decency. In a lot of cultures, this would be considered the norm
She postet that video to the socials? She ruined his carreer as a hard gangster!. What a mess....
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Perfect.
That young man was cougar hunting
Nah i woulda done it too look at her 😭 bro saw her on the license and had too😭
What an amazing young man😊
😢❤
where i live this is a normal deed
I would of asked for some head
he could have easily taken everything that was in that purse and most likely would have way more than he did before, but instead he did the right thing and still got rewarded and i can GUARANTEE that purse didn’t have anywhere close to 3k in it😂😂. W Human
he’s so fine what’s his insta
Ring cameras always come in clutch
hope this kid is having a good life so far!❤
He probably just thought the woman's ID was attractive lol
What a great role model to other kids his age!
MILF MILF.MILF
She bad asl I would return it tooo😭😭😭
If I saw her license I'd be running over there too
I mean I’ve given my share of bags and wallets back and where the hell is my 3k. Next time im taking all the cash and pass the good deed on to someone else 😂
His grandmother raised him
He's so cute 😍 he's 18 now 😉😁
God fearing young man ❤
plot twist he took all the credit card info
His father and mother could have both raised him
24m Views for returning purse in usa 😂
Good for yoy kiddo
I once left my wallet at a gas station with $1400 in it. I returned to work and realized I didn't have it so I went back and the cashier had it for me. I gave him $200 and thanked him profusely.
Naw homey saw her ID and was hoping maybe he get laid afterwards
Good kid
Omi that is very adorable
he fine ngl
Well done young man 👍
There is no hope
Real thug. Real man!
he fine asl.
Oooo who's that 😍
someone get me his number now.
I speaks alot to who raised him , that young man was taught the right honest way.
Good young man. We need more young adults like this.
He looks like a thug but proved he wasn’t
When asked why he returned the purse: "the woman in the photo on the ID was pretty hot and I was hoping maybe she would let me tap" 😂
Beautiful story happy to hear this good for all sides invloved have a good day everyone
Yeah my guy got rewarded nice good deed
Nawh he wanted some 😂😂 he seen that girl was fine af lol
Good for you Adrian 👍 blessings 😇
As adorable as he is, for me returning the purse is just common sense. Crazy that we live a time where you can be pretty much sure to never see your belongings back it you lose them
Good thing they were rich
If i were him i woulda tried to get at the friend😂😂😂
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 I bet the lady was really happy. Year's ago I returned a ladies purse to her address and she was really really happy. Cause she was like I didn't know what was going to happen since she had cash to pay her rent and utilities and car payment. And the rest for stuff and food. She was not home but her kid's was. And they called her and said mom thos guy found your purse. Minute's later she pulls up and gets out and she was like thank you. Offered to pay me for gas and I said it's ok I was planning on picking up a sweet lady who is actually my friends neighbor next door. I never seen the lady but her kid's all the time cause the lady was always taking care of her mom.
he so fineee too
I wonder if those women paid him a little extra on top of the money.. 😉
❤❤❤❤yessss
Handsome young man
Thumbnail threw me off a bit because he looks like a wannabee gangster (not trying to be rude I'm just saying what he looks like) but the kid did good there's still a little hope in gen Z
W young lad.
Bro that kid looks more gánster than Compton Crips 😂
You go Bro!
"family" is everything....props the good samaritan ✨
Someone raised a good man!
Ritch bitchez.  Good on yah kid
Class doesn't come from expensive clothes and material things. This is what you call 'class'. Respect bro! Edit: 3K? I would say 3785 is more like 4K. 😅
Rumor has it that the kid is now dating her
Hope for humanity
Bro turned in a quest item 💀
It’s actually sad that some kind of action is praised so much, cause in my opinion that is something everyone should do in such situation
What an Example of a young man
salute to this young man hope for your bright future
Can we get more positive stories like this flowing through the algorithms for once? So tired of seeing so much negative stuff online. It's refreshing seeing good deeds and positive news.
Very good honest guy
What a wonderful young man ❤️ This makes me SO happy
My friend found a wallet in a parking garage. Took it across the street to the cop station. They threatened him with theft if anything was missing. He threw it on the counter and left.
That's good parenting 💜🙏✝️🇺🇸😊
I've done this many times and don't get nothing, zero, nada
Love this
Where's  the video he receives the money?
💜💜💜
why didnt yall post the gofundme link?? 🤦‍♂🤦‍♂🤦‍♂
I wish that Australian were as generous as American women! I returned this woman’s wallet with FOUR credit cards… Guess what! Nothing happened… I still remember her name AND to never return the favour again!
Hell naw ..Be my luck   I take it back they look at me and say………    “Thank you”
He’s cute too.
Great guy good job dude 👏
Good people, many blessings to all , wonderful 😊
Good job young man. You absolutely done the right thing!
‘There’s hope for our younger generation’ what?
We all know why he dropped that purse off, boy saw that picture and wanted some cuddy
Don't you see how messed up the world is? Making this a huge deal? this should be normal. OMG.
Integrity is a great word
Even though he looks like “a bad person” on how he’s dressed, never misjudge them too quickly. You may never know if they’re actually nice. That’s just how comfortable they dress. I had friends like that and they were *EXTREMELY* over protective of me. All boys in those type of outfits and one girl. They were like wolves protecting their mate lol. But I loved them anyway.
cringe...
He's so fine
What is really awesome too is that if he ever applies for a job/college in the future and they search the kid up, they will see this story
Nice to see Central Cee being a good samaratin!
Wish they would’ve interviewed him … but there’s still hope for this generation
am i the only one who noticed how great that purse was?🔥
SUCH A GOOD YOUNG MAN!!
How lovely of you all x glad to see good people do still exist 💜
Bravo! I love this story. I think my son would have done the same actually and tried to return it.
The kid returns your purse and instead of paying him with your own money, you start a go fund me so other people do it for you lmao
What a good kid
bro I did this when I was little, and the purse had all the persons important stuff, I got $20
Thank you to this boys parents they raised a wonderful young man with respect....good for you young man🤗🤗😇
Applaud these ladies and this young man.
Great kid raised great parents
Good for the kid !  Keep the fund going let's get him a MILLION DOLLARS !!! WooooHooooo
Nah that’s gay asf
Being rewarded for not being a thief? what the hell is this world
And he is fine too
Ended up getting 17K+ :)
Honestly the only stuff i see online from the teens these days is really bad stuff.... im happy to see some good come from gen z
Amazing young man, i love that he has such a good heart and didnt do what I or some other people would do and keep the cash😂😂😂
Would a Ghetto kid do th same?
THIS COUNTRY NEEDS MORE LIKE HIM... AND CONGRATS TO THE GIRLS FOR REWARDING HIM. WONDERFUL STORY.  GREAT JOB MOM!
Dang the lady didn't give him nothing at first but waited for a social media response ....
all i see, is a kid, that dresses like a hoodlum, doing the right thing. all this proves is, you can be raised wherever, have whatever style you want, even if its a gang style, similar to how women get shamed for their way of dressing, NOT falling to stereotypes. you can dress HOWEVER you want, be ANY RACE you were born, any sex, born or identified, and you can and WILL do the right thing, no matter if, returning that purse is literally a DANGEROUS thing to do, and, gas isn't free, especially in that area, you can use your time, use your money, and sleep well knowing you did right. and im grateful this teen gets over 3 grand to do whatever he wants, he could blow it all on slots idc, he got that, doing the RIGHT thing.
Momma raised him right, she gets much praise!
Shes an aunt?
Thats how were suppose to be doing the right thing even if no ones watching...i have a saying engraved in my head  I DO THE THINGS I DO FOR NOTHING IN EXCHANGE and most of the times its that thinking that gets you a reward and sometimes i try not to accept it but it would be an insult to them but  i would prefer not to...
it is quite rare nowadays good on you mate for being honest
Instant act of good karma.
One time I found a wallet as a kid and returned it to the owner and he didn't even say thanks & immediately slammed the door in my face with an angry expression. I walked home crying lol
He prolly stole it
Always try to reward people that do the right thing, this was beautiful!❤️
No good deed goes unpunished
We need more kids like this!
Thank you Adrian. You did a very good thing and I hope Karma repays.
Praise the LORD this momma instilled this in him.
Thanks for the parents of this young boy.
That lady looks dumb as all get out
Gangbangers? Take note, this is how to be a man have self pride and proper manners In between Your good deeds just keep gang banging, as you were The man them
scam. this is getting out of hand. just liek the homless guy that gave the couple 20$
"here is your purse ma'm" "aight" *shuts the door and leaves*
He's driving an Audi. He doesn't need your debit cards...
“thieving mexicans” “Bad hombres”
He did the right thing. In my house/family= it's expected! Nowadays it's rewarded & i understand that.
In this World exist some good people
God bless that young man and I am glad to hear that he was raised right!!!!
That kid is doppee
This kind of behaviors..returns lost items, purses, smartphones, etc is very common and normal to do in Japan, I’m Japanese living in nyc and many times I found these and I could return them without getting rewards which I don’t want, but when I lost my purses contained my driver license at neighbor supermarket, but never returned, never expect in America or such big cities, but a few American friends do same as I do…just own conscientious,,,poor education in here.
Awesome 👏
Thank you Jesus for a kind soul 😊
No one is concerned that this woman is just throwing $3000 around like it's nothing. American idiots.
That’s a real and honest man right there. 👏🏻👏🏻
It’s a good deed but should this be unusual.. It says a lot that a simple act made a YouTube video and revived a huge reaction, What a bad society we have these days
If I returned someone's purse and got 3k from it god damn I'd break down on the spot
Role model
Real one. That's what good karma feels like
good job my dude
What a great kiddo!!
❤
That will give him a headstart on life, 3,000 dollars is a lot for a kid his age.
I know my boy was hoping to be invited inside.
good on him, taking his own time to help someone else.
Love this! Finally some good stuff.
I think we can all agree that things like these shouldn’t be news but good on the kid.
God Bless them all, I pray they all stay in touch!
Integrity: "Doing the right thing because it's the right thing to do, even when noone is watching."  Awesome job Mom. Thanks for carrying it forward Adrian. - 💝
Probably got cold feet
Bwaino
never judge a book by a cover
If they put as much effort into glorifying people like this over school shooters and serial killers on Netflix. Then maybe society might be a bit different.  But who cares about people when you can get clicks.
The fact that a huge deal is being made over someone doing the proper thing just goes to show how truly sick our society has become.
Okay this is just if since i don't know .. but if he came in that audi to bring back the purse he definitely doesn't need that 3k+
Good kid!  :)
We need more stories like this.  Making good people famous is how we’ll heal society.
Great story
Congrats to this young man 🎉
Wow wishing many more people be like this.  Do the right thing even when no one is watching.  Great kid.
Pat on the back to you young man. ❤ Proves that parents words do stick.
Good kid! Good parents  = Good Kid. Not all of the time, but this time for sure.
a california teen sees the picture of a female on her Id and said since there is no money in here im going to try and smash
That’s amazing but i wonder if he noticed the lady was attracted and wanted to meet her lol 😂
I mean the bar is pretty low if doing the right thing is this crazy.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Good on him. If only everyone was like that 🙏
Hopefully they reach out again when hes 18, if you know what I mean ;)
Top lad.
Everyone messes up. Everyone is struggling. But during times of weakness when we may fall, to sacrifice ourselves again to the truth provides a lesson that will light the path to a higher power within the unknown. As above so below.
These two ladies can definitely reward my young broskie iykwim.
What an amazing young man.
very good! love how he went out his way to do the right thing. and I love how the owners of the purse were grateful and wanted to reward the boy
looking at his kid i'm sure there was nothing he could use but was hoping for a reward
His mom is doing it right... and the young man is doing it right. Finally a story full of winners.
🙏🏽😂Nice guys! I found this lady’s wallet and searched her on FB and message her and later she picked it up. But didn’t get anything but that’s fine.
Thank God for some news about a good deed and people reciprocating it.
Doing what is right - even when nobody is watching is called integrity. This gentleman has integrity.
Plot Twist: THat Purse was empty with no cash lol
good guy, good job, keep it up
How is that such a big deal lmao. Y'all kinda sad ngl
look at his chains tho, kid prolly saw the $600 rent money in there and laughed
great kid
So kind we need people like this
Just turn it into customer service like a normal person?
He probably stole the purse and any valuables inside the purse  before returning it. Least likely be suspect.
Cool the kid is blessed and good luck to him , deserves his rewards
All brown and black people don’t steal
doing the right thing very often rewards in much better ways than just taking
Bro got sum cuddy after this aired 😂
I totally didn't need to cry today
This is nice, but now people steal and return items expecting a reward.
what a lame video, at least its a break from the bad news
"hope for ur younger generation" not anymore bud. not anymore.
He saw that ID and wanted to return it
i was raised the same way, we definitely have hope for the younger generations
I did this once with a wallet and the woman looked at me as if I had stole her stuff… 🥺
Mad respect for homeboi
Straight from the Hood
the ant terriible person
I found a wallet years ago. I opened it and got the address, put it in my gps and returned the wallet to the guys house. His dad tried to give me his sons money but I refused and told him that God will reward me but thank you. I forgot about that moment until now watching this video
Just by looking at him, you know people would immediatly judge him as a bad apple. The man was raised properly and shows that a book cannot be judge by its cover.
NEWS ALERT - niceness exists in the USA ... anywhere else this would not make headlines
no es un poco ilegal compartir eso??😅
His parents must be proud. Kudos to you young man 👍🏻
Woow man
based kid
Damn fine kid.  He's going to be an amazing man when he grows up
Plot twist he stole it, then returned it to finesse the reward 😂
he just wanted to smash
yo what is the aunt IG? asking for a friend
The foundation of a healthy society is based on education and values and that comes in the family
Love it! Such Hope...Thank you, teen. Thank you, teens, Mom. And thank you ladies for sharing. "I am still confident of this: I will see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living." Ps. 27:13
Good kid! There is hope
when i was 20 i found set of keys on the sidewalk while roller blading didnt know whos they were but it had a planet fitness card on there so i called the gym to get the owner numbers, they didnt want to at first but i metioned theres a bunch of keys and eventually they gave me his phone number and i called him and met up at a local restaurant and he awarder me 100$ and said i saved him from a lot of hassle and trouble. i didnt expect any $$ but 100$ 10 years ago was a lot of $$.
God bless him!
this is not normally a place that rewards kindness, love to see this stuff.
Good job kid!
Buen chico!!
I'm shocked at how simple and obvious act is worth an item on the news and 24 million views on youtube. Is that really that rare over there in the USA?
i returned $27000 to a wealthy business owner and she gave me 100 bucks LOL
Wonderful
Aww bless him 💖💖💖
that's when you know it truly is a good thing, when someone does something good without having to take a video of it
💗💗💗💗💗💗
💗💗💗💗
Good Job Young Man
Need more like him out there!!! Strong work parents
I wish there were more stores like this.
what a great lad - a hero - his family should be soooooo proud❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
And what do you want to bet, that this wasn't covered by most SD news outlets? My God, we need more young men like Adrian here. There is still hope for young generations. He has proven that with his act of sincerity. Thank You for your honesty Adrian Rodriguez. Your Mom must be darn proud.
About a year ago I found a purse behind my restaurant. It had around $650 in cash and a cashier's check for if I remember right $1200. I couldn't find the person on social media she had a common name. The Yellow Pages had a listing for that name. It ended up being her mom. She said she accused her daughter of being back on drugs because that was her rent money. She had called the mom crying asking for money for her rent. The mom cried on the phone telling me she accused her daughter of being on drugs and being a bad mother to her children. When the daughter came to pick her purse up she tried to give me money and then my children money. I told her it was more important for me to teach my children to do right rather than to take any money. She kept telling me how great I am. I told her it doesn't take a great person to not steal someone else's money. That money wasn't mine and would have brought bad karma anyways.  But that teenage boy is a great young man for this. He's only 17 and I'm sure could use the money. But made the right choice. He must have great parents or great role models.
Best way to show your mom how much she has instilled in you.
He deserved it! He was honest and it’s rarely rewarded anymore! God Bless Him!
The mom set great example for this young man, and the fact that he listen to what she said, it shows how much respect he has for her. Thats all you can ask for as a parent,because you can teach and tell these kids ,but when they leave you, all you can hope for is that they hear your voice in they're heads before they make the wrong decisions. Good job young man ,don't follow lead.

I once seen a wallet on a busy road so I pulled over to get it. Before I could go back and get it a truck already pulled over and messed with it. I thought he took it but he left it on the road. Probably took the money out... I picked up the wallet . Looked at the address and drove to return it. The person was so happy and thankful. It made my day. But I felt bad that he probably thought I took his money then returned the wallet.
Heart warming !
my guy was tryna hit
That’s right youngster! Mis respetos!
now this is the type of media they need to start showing none of this negative stuff that’s influencing people, the good part of humanity, i’m so glad this got many views this will influence people to return others belongings and maybe influence them to return it, this is how i want to raise my kids one day and i think everyone should
Such a gud lad❤
😊 His mother raised it right
faith in humanity and younger generation restored.. kudos to the parents and to the kid!!!!
That’s a good man
Congratulations also to the guy’s parents. Rockstar kids come from rockstar parents.
His mother raised a fine young man and I'm sure is proud of him everyday. I salute them both.
The fact that this is a new story shows that there is no hope for today's generation.  This should be expected of people, not a surprise to be made a big deal out of.
Y’all put out a go fund me? Boutta become a community advocate
YESSSSS. This is amazing! These ladies doing this for this young man will positively impact him for the rest of this life
What an awesome young man. Someone did right by him.
well done young man your a good person  and mum would be very proud,, cheers from australia
No way he delivers that purse if the drivers license inside was an ugly chick.
great young man
I was blind drunk on a stag night in London, somehow got home, but had lost my wallet - obviously I had to cancel all my cards etc... about 6 weeks later I get a call from London Underground, saying they have it... Honestly I really didn't thing it would be worth going to get. But I did... and it still had over £100 in cash, all my cards, even an engagement ring (different story)... it was all there. I thought about it afterwards - That lost wallet must have passed between at least 4 people, probably 7.... None of them took it, although it would have been very, very easy to do so. I asked for the details of the person who handed it in - I was going to give them a few hundred for... well - total honesty. But I was told "that is confidential". Very annoying. I gave the contents of the wallet to a homeless charity - I'd already lost it. The ring is another matter. :)
While im happy for this guy i am also envious.  I once found a wallet in a mall by the food court area.  It had credit cards social security, membership cards and cash.   I called the # liated but got no answer.    Decided to mail the guy it back with everything inside cause i didnt have a car or any other way to xontact him.    While i didnt do it to get something in returen, it would have been nice if i did.
Great Haul! $3k, plus whatever the purse had in it originally!  (jk - Great Kid!  and we Love him!)
Subhanallah. Good man. He’s got a good mother.
nata???
Someone Raised that child right
Dunno if this was worth a gofundme lol but good on him.
What a great young man.  Someone should give him a scholarship.
100% he had to see the hot mamacita in the ID
Good boy !
And he actually took the time to go to the address , just to make sure it was received by the right owner ❤
Honesty is the best policy..my mum taught me that also.. ❤
proud of the younger generation <3 great morals and values all around, from the parents to the kid himself!
This world needs your kind of honesty and honor desperately. May the blessings of the Lord be with you and your family.
Great job, Adrian !
The content of one's character is revealed by his actions when no one is watching.
God bless that young king
My faith in the younger gen hasn't been completely destroyed....
Great!
they would go crazy if they ever lost things in switzerland
uhh...central cee?
Well done... After you made it viral he is jackass in his hood!
this guy has a good upbringing .......hats off to the parents ! you have a good kiddo.
Well i did this once and didnt even got a thank you 🤣🤣
Surprise surprise, he wasn't white.
well done - from all sides !
That Gofundme is now over $4 million dollars..
honestly this trending is just so sad

GOOD ON THIS KID AND HIS PARENTS This is really the worst thing to lose your purse/wallet
Good on you Mr. Rodriguez. Had a similar issue about a year ago.  My sons (11 and 15) and I were doing the weekly grocery shopping.  We checked out behind a delightful elderly couple (I would say 80+).  While my elder son and I were unpacking the shopping cart, my younger son noticed that the gentleman left his wallet on the stand near the card reader.  His first instinct was to take the wallet and run outside to return it to the gentleman.  I couldn't have been more proud.
Something tells me he didn't "find" it.
FELICIDADES PARA EL JOVEN!....SUS PADRES HICIERON UN GRAN TRABAJO CON EL!
I wish we lived in a world where this was normal
Also speaks a lot about his mom and his upbringing.
Well done young man.
Gigachad
Beautiful thing that young man did. Hopefully he was rewarded with $$ even not expected. I would have given him $ also
The definition of "Don't judge a book by it's cover"
Glad I am not a woman, I would leave my purse everywhere,,
Surprised that black kid returned it. Didn't keep it. Very Surprised.
Eliana Martin is gorgeous!!!
proud mama!
He was raised right
Love this young man.
This gives me hope!
PARENTS be proud. Also, never ever EVER judge any book by it's cover.
GOOD KID
I once found a purse and brought  it back to the owner. The owner yelled at me where did i get it from and not even thanked me 😂
Mom of the year right there.!well done.
Proud of that young man raised and disciplined well by parents he grew doing the right thing in life hats off thanks to that lady who reward the teenage boy God bless and more blessings to come.
Do the right thing, even when no one is watching ❤️
BIG HUG FOR ADRIAN !
Out of topic but I'm concerned about your thyroid. You seem to have an enlarged thyroid, please get it checked.
This is the first positive thing I've seen in a long time
Way to go kid
That kid got ROBBED! standing in the line at the DMV to get a new license is worth WAY WAY more than just $3k .. I don't think there is a price low enough to do all that.
Kuddos to the young man who returned the purse; although it's sad to think that in this day in age doing the right thing is out of the ordinary.
See, doing the right thing does pay off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
👏👏👏💐
Props to that teen and his parents!
Normal behavior that is rewarded. Weird, isn't it? Too bad this isn't the most normal thing in the world 🤡
A lovely story. The young man's parents should be very proud of him and also of themselves. His reasons for returning the property I can relate to. Well done!
he is good but he looks like loval street criminal
That’s a man of Honor, God bless him! God open doors for him.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Good kids from good parents!!!
awsome kid  God Bless
imagine if bro stole 1 dollar
I bet HE'S not confused about what gender he is or have 20 "pronouns". Thats what having good parents looks like
Good man! Good to see some of these kids still have mothers that teach them how to respect others in this world
I put a label with another phone # on my cell phone. In case I lose it, I hope a Good Samaritan will return it. I lost my wallet once when I was young and someone that likely worked in a law firm mailed it back to me.  Good people in world 😊
I hope he shared the cash with his mom - it's hers merit! Nice, bro!
Im 54 y/o and sad to say when I was young I once found a wallet with like $70, I took the $ but returned wallet by mail. The now me would surely return wallet/purse with the $ because I know better now. I always try tell my kids do the right thing as well. Because karma will get you someday.
There is hope
There is still hope !
beast mode fr, what a guy
I'd hire him.
It's funny to watch how in the states they turn an ordinary act of a normal person into a feat.where I grew up, finding other people's things and keeping them for myself does not even have such a thought.
I am proud of him and his family, and the ladies who rewarded him. Such people make the world more liveable. Great hugs to you all.
wow... sorry Guys in USA but in Europe this happens more frequently that someone returns found purse...
Well done young man. You will go far in life.
Hell yeah man. I love it when good kids do good things and get rewarded. Good parenting on that moms part, I’m sure hes very proud to have her as a parent.
he fine af
He stole it xd
Kid is set on the right path.  Great to see these days.  Wtg young man.
❤good stuff 👏 need more ppl like this
Finally some good news 👍
Honesty at its peak ❤️
Aww he's so cute🥰 standing there with a purse🤣🥰😍👏🏽😌 thanks for being genuine
Nice story. I have given up,being so nice though. I am an ordinary looking middle class woman, no threat to anyone. When o would find wallets or purses in a parking lot or fallen off cars or in a store? Huh. The owners would accuse me of taking the cash. Some would just grunt a thanks, turn away without a smile. I used to go to considerable trouble trying to return an item. Now? I just toss obviously lost things in a local mail box. I am not seeking a reward, just a heartfelt thanks. A woman I know found a wallet with 20,000 dollars in it. She went to much trouble to get it back to the old gentleman who lost it. He was rude and mean and even threatened her.

Beautiful!!!
good on you young fella and your mum...sounds like my mum, my mum would always do the right thing, remember one Christmas while shopping we had left the shop and almost back at the car, when she looked at her change and they had given her too much, it was only a few cents though and that's what us kids said coz we knew what she would do and sure enough, she goes "no !!!  it's not mine" so turn back around we did and walked back across town with us kids in tow to that shop, it was a very hot day, but right is right I suppose
he was trying to hit forsure
Dude the kid isn’t some hero. He’s obviously a clairvoyant with the ability to see into the future. He clearly knew the best approach would be to return the purse in order to garner goodwill from the people.
This is very rare in today's world
Well done lad
this should be normal.... sad world we live in
its kinda weird that videos like this exist. like its such a praise that he returned her bag and he's "nice" humans should just be like this in general.
Even when no one is watching! Best line I've read in months!
thank you to the lad that returned the purse. Thank you to his mother for instilling "the right thing to do " thank you to all the folks that REWARDED this lad for the right thing !
alas, hope for the human race
This young man has my vote for President!!
YES! That's more like it. Well done, Adrian Rodriguez🤍
I have done this several times.  One time I spent several days tracking down the owner and didn't even get a thank you or kiss my ass.   I will still do what I can to return the purse or wallet.
Now that's a real Man!
I had a lady pull up to a stop light at an intersection in front of my place of employment, and her child in the back opened up the door, to which her purse fell out. She was unaware that it fell out so I grabbed it, ran up to the next intersection where she was stopped at another light to give it to her. She rolled her window down barely a few inches, snatched it quickly out of my hands and sped off through the red light like she was scared of me. You're welcome ya ungrateful b....
he fine
some one please give that kid a future he deservs it dont let him fall from grase look after him he is one in a million
grrr yummy burger *smells with distinct lavender juice*
His parents have instilled values- a rare trait these days! Normally, it’s the parents who need education!
Good story
GOOD MAN!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
That guy was raised correctly by the parents! Good job, parents!
Excellent young man!! He'll be somebody important someday.
This Is The Exception To The Rule Now, If I Find A Wallet, I'll Return The CCs And ID But If There Is Any Cash I'm Taking It, Just Being Honest, If I Lost My wallet And DIdnt Pay Attention I Deserve To Lose It
There is  people  dose  just  the  opposite  and  doing  the  wrong things.  But  think about it  if  there  were  more people  doing  good. The  sky  the  limit
Integrity: "Doing the right thing because it's the right thing to do, even when noone is watching."  Awesome job Mom. Thanks for carrying it forward Adrian. - 💝
if i saw that id of her fine ahh id bring it back hopin for a different reward gyat
Good job.  Awesome!
Thats a perfect example of good karma!!!
Nice to hear such stories again!
dude good for this guy good big giant man in my eyes
Whom ever raised him, raised him right. Well done young man 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Instant karma goes both ways.
I'm proud of him for doing that
good for that young man, we need as many people to be genuinely honest people like him. Wonderful example of a great human being:-)
Repping SD! Good job young man! <3
that dude going on some places
Good job kid!
Congrats and refreshing to see such good behavior.
This is great and all but dont forget the main point this young man made very clear. "Do the right thing even if it doesnt benefit you" This was still a very good thing and it paints a wrong image that he gets rewarded like that. Still good to see.
Enormous credit to this young man and his mom , with his principles he will be successful in life and hopefully potential employers , who do do social media checks , will see this video and it will help him get a fulfilling career , it proves this man is honest and goes out of his away to help others , bravo Sir.
top man
Oh. I'm happy you didn't get killed.
I guess I am lucky to know many young folks who would do the exact same thing!
Maybe he can buy a belt[C'mon only joking]
Isn't Karma great?  Always treat others with the same respect and dignity you would like to be treated with.  Kudos to this young man!!
nice
the boy was raised right and has good parents . not many would have done that in todays times , so he is a awesome young man , may the lord bless him big time
Good guy.
That's Awesome.  Not very many good kids like that anymore
His friend jajjaja
That's really dope!
what a lovely young man!  His family must be really proud of him.  Also what a lovely family to reward him that way, he deserved it.
God Bless Him ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Is that azzy??
You guys get very lucky not just in getting the purse back if the wrong person found it they well could have went to your house broke in and who the hell knows what else very lucky a good person like this teenager is.
👍
Adrian Rodriguez, you da man👍😎
Nice 👍🏽
fine and raised right
3 thousand dollars for returning a purse? I returned a purse once I got 20 dollars
That's cool that's a good kid
My friends and I were good kids and dresssed like rappers he a good kid
God bless him! He’s a great kid with a bright future and I’m even more excited to see that they have him a reward especially because he didn’t expect one 😊
See it begins with the parent,s
W let’s go!
This kid nailed exactly what peoples' thought processes should be - "If I lost my stuff I'd want it back too"
Nice to see a young guy that was raised right. I cannot believe she didn't give him at least 50 - 100 bucks! He wasted his time and gas driving to her.
As a teen myself im happy to see others around my age do the right thing. We really need more people like this guy!
This young man was well raised. AWSOME  parents he has. Gb
Beautiful ❤🎉 sweet gesture
What a fine young man. He will be a good father when he has kids.
Here we go! Finally social media pushing positivity!
Your mama proud of you bro every person in the world proud
Good kid. Wish all people to be like him🙏
lol, what could he take from woman's purse .. :D lipsticks ..?  but kudos for bringing back , not just throwing it away somewhere
shiii I would go back too she looks good af lol
Good people seem be a dying breed theses days , goes to show what humanity shoukd be , absolutely brilliant ❤
good man!!
They're definitely lesbians btw
Cool thanks 🙏
We don't call San Diego America's Finest City for nothing. It's the people! :D
ezy 3k
this almost NEVER happens... so this kid is gold...
Plot twist : "her credit score is now -400"
Good parenting
My faith to this guy is restored!
His Mom should be Proud!  Her hard work as a good parent paid off!
Plot twist, he stole it off her the morning before 😂
The REAL heroes DONT wear capes 🥰
A $3K reward? Common decency would have required me to refuse such reward. I would have enjoyed the pleasure of returning the purse for the rest of my life for free.
Good on Adrian for doing what he did.. tbh if i were him though i'd be afraid of picking up the purse cause i wouldn't wanna be accused of anything. U nvr know who has a gun
What a sweet, respectful angel.
This young man is raise by a good parents
Maybe he was the one who stole that purse
Absolutely beautiful story!
Now he know where she live/ who she live with/ n can start the stake out
Everyone American teenager should WATCH this video, I don't care what type of parents you have, NOTHING can stop you from song the wright thing
by rewarding that behaviour. is the right way to encourage all people to do the right thing
I did the same thing once …..not even a thank you .
I loved the advise from his mother.  He was raised right.  Thank you for sharing a grate story,
whats his @
Love, love, love this!! God Bless!!  God Bless this young man!!
God is Good❤❤🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
I dropped my phone before without knowing it and the person was able to text my mom (who I was with at the time) to meet us and give it back. It's such a relief when someone helps you! I love paying it forward.
good work! need more like him in this world and not the others ya know
Probably scammers
Well done i like seeing people happy.
Much love, young man. Your Mother is an extremely wise woman. I am sure all the other tidbits of knowledge she has taught you will take you far in life, keeping you safe as you go. Thank you for such an uplifting piece of social media for once that it brought tears to my almost 60 yo eyes. There is hope it seems for our younger generation. Young man, if you could do 1 more thing, pass this wisdom on to your friends and anyone else who will listen. Again, kudos and your Mom is the 💣.  💯🐺🌎🏳‍🌈🎄💥🌌🍔🍟🍁 All the best to you always from Ontario, Canada.
Great kid😂Great news
Goes to show you shouldn’t judge a cholo by his pro club.
w gangbanger
In your face to people who say our generation is going to fail.
outstanding young man
good job
Also a great kid. Karma gonna come back around in other ways than $$$   Rich in spirit rich in spirit.
Praise God what a wonderful extraordinary young man!🙏🏽👱🏻‍♀️
Love It❤
Plot twist to the comments : he wasn’t raised right- he’s a good human all on his own
old people always talking about there is hope for this new generation like there was not bad people back in the day. cmon there will always be good and bad people
Very surprising these days
Good dude!
I found a wallet in the Escondido mall parking lot I waited for the owner outside. Sure enough this lady came up to me and said hi that’s my wallet u found thanks. And that’s it. 😢  I was sad cuz I checked the wallet, lady easily had over a thousand in cash. That’s when I regretted my decision
Kind of says a lot about the world we live in when basic human decency is such an anomaly that it gets you on TV. Good job to this kids parents.
Good hearted people do exists, sadly the negative is spoken about more than the positive, perhaps as a warning to others.
Well done, kid.
Well done young man.
well Done😊😊
INTEGRITY is doing the right thing when nobody is watching. I'm glad to see such a selfless person be celebrated 👏🏽
Adrian Rodriguez, we need more men in the world like you.
Melina Marquez Theres Something Like A big Nodule on YOUR NECK, You shall go see a Doctor to know if it`s cancer, cause a woman had that on her Neck and a docter saw by Tv and he told her that was a cancer and it really was!
"Don't judge the book by the cover " is real
awesome kid!
Good Job for helping her!🎉🎉🎉
Trade offer : You recieve 3000$  : I recieve 3700$
good kid, about time some one becomes a good role model, need more like this
Was raised right. It's refreshing to see.
I gave a man his wallet when he dropped it when I was 10 and all I got was a quarter...
That is a good quality to teach your kids...Christians values...
The aunt is hot!!
Do good deeds
$3k for a normal good deed that shouldn't have a price tag??????? It's just a driver's license
I blame the parents!
🥹
"If I lost my stuff, I'd want somebody to bring it to me" start thinking like this young boy yall
Love this story🤗🤗
Good job lil man ✌and great heart for the women💖
I would carry this money for myself 👀
Kudos to that young man !
NICE WHEN GOOD PEOPLE DO GOOD THINGS
HaHa, my auntie returned a purse she found, her reward was 10p. and this was in the 1980's, the purse contained £4000
Love that young man!!!
Kid made 15 grand doing what everyone should have done.
Well done that young man.
So rare in this day and age what a great kid with solid morals, so good to be rewarded by these loving people on the receiving end of his good deed.hope yet people hope yet....
Younger generation 🤡🤡 As if their generation isn't full of thieves and drug addicts 🤣
Plot twist : "he knew it was a rich persons bag and would get a reward fosho"  ahhhah  jk jk That is always wonderful to see the youth take the high road, like mama said "even when no ones watching". The foundation he was given by Mom is ❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥.
Good job to his Mother!!
I've did this 3 times in my life and barly got a thank you. Lucky guy !
We have hope.
Legend
Walking on a trail, passed 2 ladies with a dog. Walked a few miles more where I usually turn around. Continued back to my truck. On the way I saw part of a wallet which had a license, credit cards, etc. I thought, take it to a police station. Looked up the address on the license, it was on my way home so I just stopped and delivered it to the very surprised ladies. They didn't even know they dropped it. Good day.
We need more people
I once Found A bag full of personal belongings And took it home Its still here Its mine now😐
On the flips side - I was once waiting in the line to get cash out of the machine and woman in front of me left her cash in the machine so I had to chase her down the road. I got to the lady and said 'You've forgotten this', she then basically snatches it from my hand without so much as a thanks and quickly walked off. Some people!!
I had done a similar deed while I used to work at a Walmart collecting shopping carts. I found an iPad someone had forgotten in a cart and turned it into customer service without thinking twice. The next day the owner of the iPad came up to me and deeply thanked me since there were irreplaceable pictures on it and went out of there way to give me a 300$ gift card. Words can't describe how happy that made me feel man. We really do need more people that actually do the right thing in this world....
Top Man
glad to see somebody in my generation who actually does good things, he was definitely raised right
why he lowkey fine though
Good on him. You don’t see that much.
that aunt looks like a good bit of fun
Any parent can say they raised their kids right.. some kids judt disregard their parents.. good thing this kid listen to his mama.
I returned a purse with a bunch of money in it a long time ago and got a box of chocolate haha :(
Thats what I'm talking about. Awesome teenager. I wish I could have sent money to him also.
True chad
Good lad.
Yeah, we need to publicize the good things people do.
Such a wonderful young man!
Do the right thing even when no one is looking-  somebody's momma'!
Beautiful people beautiful story. Thank you for sharing!
LOL. COOL
Smashed it kido
God bless u boy...
Aww he looks so sweet
aww that was very sweet of him for doing that for him❤
he so fine
Awesome!
"In reality whatever you do for someone else you actually do for yourself" kudos to him for following the Laws of Creation
Amazing kid! I wish we got more stories like this.
❤ good guy
wow wow awesome
The kid knew what he was doing…….
If that audi shown in the video is what he was driving I can see why he didn't keep the money
And Inside Edition gets $75000 of this video with 25 mln views. At the end everyone is happy
A good person
Kid looks like a thug but has a good true honest heart of gold.
Been there. I was tempted to take this wallet I found but ended up giving it to the owner with all the money inside and got rewarded
What a kind soul
You know he look in for money😂😂😂
Never judge a book by its cover
Everyone in this story was incredible.  The young man for doing the right thing and women for going to such lengths to reward him.  Thank you all for putting a smile on my face!
What a beautiful story ❤ Always do the right thing when no one is watching 🥰
Nice!
Nah, bro simply saw her photo and thought that she was a baddie and just had to pay her a visit.
It reminds me of one time when I was picking up a pizza for a delivery since I was working as a delivery girl, I found a phone laying on the counter and it seemed to be from the customers just before me but they had left 15 minutes ago already. Even though I had to do a delivery, I decided to return the phone first and called one of the last numbers the phone had dialed and I cycled to the person's hotel. Just the fact that I returned the phone to the right owner was enough of a reward to me!
I would take the purse if it’s has much money 👀
Good onya young fella ^_^ way to be <3
We have good people in the world.
i remember a case in hong kong where a maid found millions of dollars of a company's money in a dumpster. she returned the money and as a thank you they gave her a box of cookies
Don’t ever lose faith in the youth. Never stop giving them a better example.
Now that’s a g!!!!
Awesome ❤
Good job 👍
هذا الفعل عندنا عادي واي شخص يقوم به إلا أنه عندهم يعتبر خير كبير وأعتقد أن هذا يوضح المجتمع الفاسد عندهم
It's good to see good people be recognised and rewarded
Love this story.
The look on the friend's face when the one on the left was like "well didn't you offer him 20 bucks?!?" -  lol
People helping people is how we get through the Day
I would take the cash and then return the purse.
sooo… time to go to the store and look in every shopping cart😂
this bro made the best move ever
What's his Cash App please? I want to make a substantial donation 🙏
Am i the only one who see a visible lump on the lady's (Melina's) neck?
This young man is doing great job to return to lady who has lost her purse and we should realise young generation have great potential for the future. He should be pleased to have good reward.
You don't need a reason to help people
W Adrian
Yes there is hope. Praise God
If I find a wallet or purse with an ID in it I always return it if not I leave it where it is because unless I'm bringing it back to the person I don't want to get involved I don't want anybody thinking I stole the wallet
How lovely 💕
"there's a hope for our younger generation" . In my country it's the older generation screwing it up for everybody else :D
Why tf does this have 24 m views
Y does bro look like central cee
What a legend =) It's great to hear.
bro he's fine
What a FINE Young MAN who Never Forgot what his good MAMA told him!!! Spend some of your $3K Plus Wisely and $AVE the Rest for your Future!❤👍👏👏👏
Key example of never judge a book by its cover. Im sure people look at him and think he's a lowlife but deep down he's a genuinely good kid
لا تشوف السعوديين بس يرجع الشنطه ويحط فيها الفين كيف كذا مدري😂
Happy for the kid but the fact that this is such big news is absolutely terrifying. Must be the midwestern in me but it's a absolute no-brainer no-questions-asked not a second thought not even blip on the radar as far as what the right thing to do is. When I lived in the midwest if I lost my wallet I really didn't even get worried because I knew would show up at my door by somebody.
lol man gave it back
Something about this story has my antennas up.
He is my son
you guys for sure commented PRAISES here so i won't bother reading. but this gets to the news cuz a gangster looking guy returned a purse? people just judge people that quickly huh..
I found a purse in the middle of the street and found a license and credit cards. I called her to get it back to her.  I drove to an hour to a Pizza Hut to return it. When I got there the police were waiting and put me in hand cuffs and accused me of breaking into her car. She called the cops on me. I tried to be a good person. Charges were dropped but I lost my job. It’s till in my background check. It always comes up with what I do. I’m sorry I’m a good person.
I hope she gave him a handy.
Kids a ledgend
$3K Reward + 1 One Night Stand threesome
What a good kid! What comes around goes around?
He returned it cause he saw the baddy ID
I hope the IRS doesn't stumble across this video. Next time he'll just keep it.
Hopes this encourages ppl to start doing the right thing
he put a tracking device in the purse so he could get it the 'hood' way. JOKING. great dude. actions speak louder than words
why he kinda-😍
Get tf of newest comments
bro got that respectable sag
This makes me remember that Allah sees u the most when u r alone
Act of kindness numbers 1
That kid definitely stole that purse to begin with.
dudes literally pulling up in an audi with chains
That's so cute
Raised 3700$ and was never seen again)))
He's not a 17 year old boy, he's a man.  His mom is proud, I know. I don't know him and I'm proud of him.
Glad we live in a world where common sense and being nice is so shocking…. If people didn’t act like such animals this would be the norm
When I was in school I found a phone in the middle of the football field while in gym class. I put it away in my bag and continued with my day. When I got home I remembered the I found the phone and asked my mom to return me to school so I can return it to lost and found. It was a teachers phone that fell out of her pocket, and instead of a thank you they threatened to call the cops on me and my mother and I got screamed at. Luckily school director was there...she was fired a few weeks later.
"theres hope for our younger generation " will always be funny.  its a sentence that comes from such arrogance, arrogance that the older generation has provided some kind of nebulous "hope" in their lifetimes, that they have contributed to the world in a positive way.  and while this single woman is likely not a bad person, it is the phrase that reveals a sense of narcissism for being older, when looking from the point of view as Gen Z or Gen Alpha, the older generations have done nothing short of wither hope out of this planet
I Returned this kids iPhone once, It was in the middle of the road. I tried to see if I could figure out who owned it or if I could call someone to figure out who’s phone it was. Using Siri to make calls or text didn’t work unless the phone was unlocked. When you swipe to the left on the home screen it showed a map with a home icon on one of the house. I could see like half of the streets name on the map. I went to maps on my phone and typed in the beginning and there was only one road that wasn’t too far that seemed like it could be it. Only thing was this was a long street so I had to look at the whole street on my phone for a while until I was pretty confident.  We were in a rich area and I drove 10 minutes to his massive house. When I got there I saw a kid loading his baseball bag into the trunk of a new Mercedes’. I rolled my window down and yelled out “hey did you or someone in your family loose a phone?” He said “yeah?” I stuck the phone out the window and he walked up and grabbed it. He asked where I found it and how I found his house. I explained the whole half hour long process and he just said “alright” I said “have a good day” and he was already turning around to go back to his house. The kid (probably 14 y/o) didn’t even say thanks. His rich parents probably already ordered him the latest model or something. When I drove up to the house I got excited seeing that they were rich hopefully I would get a reward. I know I did the right thing it just sucks that the kid didn’t even say thanks. My homie who spotted the phone in the middle of the road literally wanted to steal it. He was like “bro there’s people we could sell this to who can unlock it” I told him “first of all you don’t even know those people, and second of all that’s not right” after we dropped it off he wouldn’t shut up ab how we should of stole it hahah. I still know that what I did was the right thing I was just hoping for some money for him and i to split lol.
if you a cartel members wife just say that
Good kid
Homie definitely hit that 😂
bro saw the ID and just wanted to smash
Mi familia is your family... basically the golden rule is the way. If only banks , corporations and government felt that way.
So let me get this straight: A rich family gets their purse back and had no plans to give any reward out for their pocket instead created a gofoundme page to let others pay? LOL
In Japan, if you lose your wallet, sometimes people will mail it to your address
imagine bro stole it and found out there is nothing so valuable so he just gave it back and got the 3k lmao
Homie standing there looking hella guilty though for something in the past 😭
Brought me tears, I wish I had a son like that
Plot twist: Thats her daughter’s boyfriend 💀
I’ve returned 3 wallets. Never been rewarded.. gaayyyy!
This guy looks too gangsta for how good he is
God Bless him!!  Raised correctly!  Cheers
Imagine he stole the Purse to get a Reward XD
in denmark this is very normal, happens all the time in fact people not returning things like that they find is very very uncommon
Good kid, but this says more about the current times, that a young man doing the right thing garners people throwing thousands at a computer to reward him.
He definitely stole it and felt bad
“Doing the right thing when no one is looking” is one of the Air Force core values, this young man is Air Force material
🗿☕️👌🏻
Plot twist he stole it and wanted to return it
👑 you dropped that buddy
❤
I found a lost iPhone years ago and contacted the owner and we met. I gave her phone back and all I got in return was”Hahah he’s a faggot”. She was with her friends in the car
What a great Kid!
Kid dressed up as a potential criminal but has the heart of a saint. Don’t judge people too fast
That’s nice of the ladies. I’ve been a broke musician through my 20s. One time I was leaving the grocery store with a carton of eggs and tortillas. I had 7.50$ left to last the next couple days. I saw someone drop money it was 235. I went back in and found them. Didn’t even say thanks. Oh well haha
Really goes to show you can’t judge a book by its cover because to most unfortunately due to his appearance you wouldn’t think he’d be so kind hearted.
still hope 4 human race
I tried returning a phone once and they thought I stole it. Never again . 😭
Returned a wallet to someone.. he blessed me with $80. Always do the right thing 🙂👍 it's called integrity look it up
God bless this young man 😇
the only reason  this was posted was to suppress class consciousness
You see this young people? You see this mom and dad? You can be a good person and you CAN raise them to be a good samariton.
Didn’t he just steal it and then decide to bring it back for a reward 😂
Karma is always watching, good reaps good, bad reaps bad. Always choose good, it makes the world better, kindness is more powerful than some people realize.
Sad that this is news these days. Don't get me wrong, it's great this kid did this. But this used to be the expected behavior. Now it's a pleasant surprise.
Good job Adrian!
I found a wallet & returned it… without the cash bout $15 lol but at least he got his id & cards back
THAT is a GREAT KID. We need more of these type of kids.
Bro said damn she kinda bad imma shoot my shot
Plottwist: The Video was staged and they shared the money that came from the fundraiser.
He listens to JoshuaSageArt for sure
I found a dudes dog in front of my house and he spotted me a $20 even after I refused
Fake
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Good things Pay out earlier or later
Adrian's mom raised him right. I hope he bought something great with the reward, but I bet he gave the money to his mom to help out.
plot twist: all 3 were in on it, they all knew each other :(
My daughter found and returned a family's lost dog for them.  They barely thanked her.
Terrific parenting on the part of his mother. A fine young man.  “Do unto others …”
If it has a picture of Eliana in it that's even more reason to return it - some might say.
latinx 💯💪
Faith in humanity restored! 🙌
The funniest part is that that $3k is probably from her husband's bank account, not hers.
That's what I'm talking about good job dude 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Terrific parents = terrific kids!!
Plot twist: there was nothing in the purse
This reminds me of the wallet i found .The girl had her social security, military id and debit card in a walmart shopping cart and i dropped it to the address and she ran out to talk but i was already driving away. It was nothing but God i found it. Being a good person cost 0.00!! Good for this young man!
You're a good man Adrian Rodriguez 👍🙏 Well done
that isn't normal ? y'all should leave the US asap
too much credit towards the parents, why discredit the guy like that? it was his good deed because he is a good person
17 years old returns woman's lost purse and goes straight to heaven
I did this a few years back. A guy dropped his wallet in a best buy parking lot.  It literally had his life in that wallet.  It had his social security card AND his green card in it. Don't ask me why he had that in there, I don't have the answer to that.  But I went to his apartment that's written on his license and  returned it.  Didn't take a penny from it or wanted any reward.  A few weeks later I lost my wallet but no 1 returned it.  Story of my life.
Looks like the women on the left has a Thyroid issue.  I hope she is getting the care she needs if that’s actually the case.
Great job lad
I woulda taken it 🤷‍♂️
probably saw the id and was like she's hot, maybe ill get a date.
Central Cee doin good things out here
look at that thig he definitley scammed these poor women
What a great young man.  I hope great things comes his way.
Thought that was CJ on grove street 😂
Spitt or swallow?
Here we can see how much of an impact good parenting can have.
Why the "he went out of his way to return the purse"? As if because he wears loose fit and a cap he couldn't be a good person...
"why you go out of your way to return de purse" why not? that's the right thing to do
when I was a child I did the same thing I found a wallet with about SEK 5000 it's like 500 dollars I called the woman "Swedish" and she came and got her wallet she tore it from my hand when I held it out to her and didn't say thank you but looked at me like a thief
Alt story: His friend stole it so that he could approach her easily
Respect!!! ❤
Luckily a BLM didnt find it, they would have kept it.
❤
Thank you mum
I work in HR. HIRED!
Not the hero we wanted. The hero we needed ❤️
Great job young man.
God is always watching. 😇❤
Maybe not all Edgar that bad
great story
im gonna cry thats so sweet
So thankful for this young man!  You can teach but what’s most important is that kids do the right thing they were taught.  He’s got integrity!  God bless him!
Veey good kid yes all aas do the right thing and yes all good deeds should come around sadly a lot don't but that doesn't mean you should not do them.
lmao slow news day
sad how this isnt just normal
Awesome
He obviously stole it and brought it back
I worked  at a brewery/ food cart hub and we get lost phones, purses, wallets etc. Once I found a bag full of drugs and money in the bathroom. All I thought was this is a set up. It's a mfing setup! As I'm leaving the bathroom I see two ladies rushing back in nervous as heck and we made eye contact. Gave them the purse/tote bag back and they asked if I looked inside. I said yes but I didn't take anything. We all went back inside the bathroom and I got Maybe $200 cash and pick of my drugs. (I only smoked weed at that point so I got Maybe an 8th) looking back I had no idea how terrible that situation could have been for me or how great. It pays to be honest because they probably would have killed me for that stash.
This is so heartwarming
i would have asked for blowey from the dark hair one
He should‘ve got a threeway too just sayin 😌
It's like he's playing a side quest in GTA
Plot Twist: Guy took purse off them, then gave it back to claim they had lost it  Result - $3k 😂
I found an old couples wallet on the airplane floor and returned it to them and the couple didn't even thank me...
Getting 3k for acting canadian damn 😂
Well done youngster. Good story.
Staged.
I dont buy it, i bet him and his frieds stole it.
Later he was found robbing an old lady with his friends
Honest and cute? Winning!
She made of plastic fr
This is so scary someone did something so simple returning a  purse back to its owner gets to be on the news and rewarded thousands of dollars looks like people rarely do good things these days, we’re so used to see bad things happen
So sweet 💓
Yo the kid looks like jay from enhypen
Bro was just tryna smash
”Always do the right thing, even when no one is watching” is the epitome of righteousness
He def seen her licence and was like Damn
Another instance where appearance doesn't matter
Que orgullosa ha de estar la mamá de este chico.🥰
I’m surprised that this is news worthy and not just the expectation
Not to take anything away from the kid, what he did was very nice and the right thing to do but it's kind of crazy that this isn't what we expect to happen and we assume most people will just take the money in the purse and don't care about the person that lost their stuff.
they want him now fr
落とし物を返すだけでアメリカではヒーローになれるの？
Got all of my respect
lol yall r dumb
Very cool
0:07 famous last words
👍
Isnt it funny that this normal behaviour is so rare, he is seen as a hero.. Good guy tho. Bit overreaction from the public as usual.
That's the way I was raised, as well. If you teach your children right from wrong, believe me, they will remember and act on it. Good job, Mom, and Adrienne.
dude completed a quest
His parents deserve a some appreciation too. Raising kids ain’t easy but these parents nailed it.
Ποιος ήρθε από skiouraki
dont fall for the goverments schemes 😠 they posed this video to get more people to return purses and not take whats in them 😠 and they raised 3k and they just gonna use it on hookers and cocaine 😠
He was the one who stole it. Fooled you all suckers.
Two of my coworkers called out of work the other day leaving me alone on a Saturday night when we had live music. We were booked from 4:30-7:15 straight with reservations. A gentleman gave me $100 as an appreciation for getting his party of 6 in on short notice. It was a process that meant finding the right accommodations for some of his party members and having to pull some bussers onto a table we watched clear out. I was absolutely melting with appreciation. I’m just a host. Many restaurants don’t even have my position so for someone to find extra value in what I had done made being there almost easy. Plus we had a wedding there earlier in the day and a kid dropped 1/8 party favour bubbles he had in the lobby. I tried to call out to him but he didn’t hear. He had plenty anyways. So every now and then I had a chance to blow bubbles right out front. Little things :.) music was good too. Always helps when we have a live band
We should all stop praising the kid and actually be like that kid!
What if he stole it and then regretted it and returned it. 🤣 Nah I'm joking. This is dope. Definitely raised right.
His heart is gold many wouldn’t have done this 👏👏
my boy tried to smash
Kudos to his mom! She raised him well 💜🙌🏼
He looked at the I.d and thought MILF. I might be able to hit if I return this… 😏
I feel like its common sense to return a lost item this important..?
His mate stole it, he brought it back. Teamwork
Faith in humanity restored
Also an insanely good idea to create  a channel and subs.
imagine if there were more people like him...i wish
he looks like the kid who would stole the woman too🤣
Notice how he’s : colored, got baggy clothes on, got gold chains , has his hat backwards but has more morals & common decency than 80% of the population
He’s a good kid but it’s crazy to think that this is not the norm in most countries
This scene reminds me of some movies 🤤
I found a purse similar to this one on a shopping cart and just handed it in to the store and forgot all about it until today 🤦‍♂️
Elina Martin looks like the grinch
fantastic
Plot twist he stole the purse and has done this many times before 😂
God Bless this young man.
Pathetic that we make a big deal out of this today... not long ago, returning lost wallets and purses was normal behavior of a decent human being, how far we've fallen is insane...
Love that he was rewarded for a good deed.
That’s not a good kid. That’s a good man.
This is the normal version of outside edition
This is so good to see, his mama should be very proud. Thanks for doing what you did for this young man. 🥹❤️🙏
Shoutout to his mom for raising him right and shout out to this kid who listens to his mom and wanders through this world doing the right thing. Much love
Well done that kid!... And good parents too... Definitely the right thing to do 👍
The world is so messed up  for something that should be normal being in the news and with a fundraiser
Hood look outside, kind heart inside. Awesome! 😎
Awesome! Love this❤❤❤❤
The local police force should reach out to him ASAP. Maybe this fine young man would love to be a police officer.
That's awesome...that young man will succeed in life. God bless him and his family🙏🏼💓💞💕
Lets goooooooo!!!!!!
Did he smash ?
very cool young man but still sad that it is something special
Would you be doing a story if it wasn’t a black guy wearing a long tshirt and chains?
The teen  was definitely raised with the right mind set and the right family, I hope he has a good future ahead of him because it is for certain his generation will contiune with good deeds
this used to be the standard
bro def hit
well done
What a good guy. I hope people can learn from him.
I’m so proud of this kid and I don’t even know him. Imagine the type of sons he will raise
Good job mum 👏
is it mean if i say that he return the purse because there was no money in it....
Honestly this isn't even worth reporting about SMH this basic decent human behavior. Its not like he rescued her out of an burning building under the threat of his own life SMH
He was raised right, good job mom.
Why he kinda.. 🫣
Yes
bros getting praised for the bare minimum
its normal behavior.. THIS IS NORMAL btw or should be.. I dropped my wallet at walmart a kid found it and his dad drove to my house to give it back to me.. I gave him all my cash in it 100 bucks for his kid to buy him something for being so great
hes such a cutie
Heartwarming ❣️
So much power behind a good mother. He learned that lesson from his mom and it caused an amazing ripple effect
DONT JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER
😊
Whoever raised him should be very proud after this
I found a mobile phone and the guy gave me £10 when I returned it. Wish Go Fund Me was around then lol
Not only the kid is a good person, the receivers were also very nice.   I remember when I was 16, I returned a lost wallet to its owner and the lady looked at me like I was a thief or something 😑 Afterwards I really thought that I could better have thrown it away instead of locating her and bring it to her.
When you do good, good things comes to you. God bless 🙏🏻
nice but to be on the news  .idk
he real fine
Huge respect to his parent and also to him 🫡
As the mother of 2 awesome 29 and 30 year old sons, I am so proud of this young man. My sons were discriminated against simply because they were young. Don’t assume that every young person is up to no good.
HE FINE
I returned a lost phone with 3 cards and a drivers licence in. All I got was a smile
He real gangsta ❤
See this kids goin places in life was raised right and didnt ask for anything in return good man folks good man
wow it‘s sad something like that is considered „going out of his way“
What a good kid. His parents raised him right.
I love this story! Congratulations to his parents for raising a wonderful young man 👏🏽👏🏽🙌🏽
❤
I found a wallet once and called the person to pick it up at the bus stop. They arrived like 1 hour later and accused me to have taken money from the wallet, which I didn't. Anyway he gave me a tenner and that's it. There was maybe 50-60 in the wallet, driving license, bank cards and Id card
Lol this narcissistic woman used him for social media clout
Ok that’s a good action but this isn’t something fantastic. To be honest, it's a standard to do so in some countries.
Amazing! Well done.
Unfortunately he's maybe 1 in 10,000 that would do this, most teens his age, especially if a girl had found it, would probably post a tik tok about this great bag they found.
Might've just done it in hopes of a reward, never know lmfao
She shouldve just gave him some head fr
The happiness that appears on these women faces proved that they had gain back the trust on the new young generation
The fact that this guy was just doing what was right and the news is like "OMG GUYS LOOK WHAT THIS KID DID!" really shows how far we can really get as humans
he fine too
He become more handsome
He wanted to get the lady’s number lmaoooo😂
he so fine 🧍🏻‍♀️
what a G
Kid definitely got blown
More kids need to be like him! Well done 👏
bruh "there is hope for our younger generation" feels so condescending. Like there wasn't before?
may god bless that young man and his mother 🤍
did he get the money tho
nahh bro has that superman Rizz he knew what he was doing
Sometimes I wonder if he would’ve stole it if there was like 5 bands in there 😂
I have been kind to strangers all my life.  BUT only received rudeness back... :(
JI out here doing side missions😂
Mom is proud and can die in peace now.
He was setting you up for a future return!🙄🥴
NOBODY can tell me that they know this young man wouldn't be judged by the color of his skin and the way he looks by a lot of people. Right? Now look! This goes to show NEVER judge anyone. This young man has been raised right! Good job to him first of all because we can raise our children "right" but it's up to them to use the knowledge and respect we've taught them. 2nd good job to his momma!
bro knows karms
What a great young man. I've done the same thing, but you don't do it for rewards. As we say here in the UK, Top Lad. Respect from England.
99% of the time you'll get nothing but a "thank you" 😂
This is just wholesome. Good job man♥️
Damnnnnn I’m about to move to Cali and loose my my wallet😮‍💨
Reminded me of smokey from friday the fit lol
Aww ❤
If that was a knacker it would of being a different story since they rob anything they can get their dirty hands on.
Total respect for this young man.
he is fine tbh
The worst part of my life where it all ended badly was in this town.
I'm just used as a pawn from the minute my own mom had me ..and I'm in my 40's. Though they managed to screw my life and that's where loyalties lie..the flag is just a symbol.
Thank the inner self male. It's all him aka female voice stop sign. Anything else is a complete and utterly lie literally. It's always been the male. Hence left ear and right ear
he fine as HELL
What’s sad is in this day of age, I don’t know if I would have opened the door 😢
One time I lost my wallet, & that’s it. I lost my wallet. I can’t find it. It’s still gone. Help
You were brave asf, I would've been so afraid to go outside 🙃
Dayum.
he so fine 😪
she is right. this one act says so much about him as a person❤️
we need more people like him ❤
instead of just keeping the money in the purse which probably didnt have anywhere near 3k in it he returned it and got a much higher award while being a good person what a chad
The fact that this was not considered the norm means there’s something wrong with our society.
Im french sorry for my english , but its terrify me how we can adulate now just some normal behaviors we all should have. Make me very sad.
What a great young man. ❤️
He was raised by a Queen😭🫶❤️
Seems a bit fake. That awkward hanging around for a reward after returning the purse.
: )
I would’ve taken 2$ from the purse to get something to drink, then return it
central cee lookin ahh
What a amazing story I love it ❤😊
hes a good guy and hes cuteeee
I stereotype like dj ghost but I thought he was the stolen
Dam easy money
He did the right thing.👍🌺🌷💐
Everyone acting like good people don’t exist😂
What goes around comes around!
That just show you that everyone isn’t a bad person and you have a lot of good people out here
I’ve been in this situation, I left my hand bag in my shopping cart at HEB. Somebody kindly returned it to costumer service.   I WAS SO GRATEFUL. This young man is amazing ❤️
I love how theres a whole YouTube video about this and news interview abt this simple thing😭
Hi
You see rasict ppl don’t be assuming shitz
Good man!  Hero!
More stories like THIS in the media please!! ❤
He looked her up on Facebook 🥵 and said damn I need to return this in person
Haha I’ve done that before but I was just thanked by the dudes grandpa he was super cool
Deep down he hoped for a reward. Thats why he brang it back
Good kid! Good job Mom!😊
Awesome.  So refreshing!
Great job young man ❤
See what good parenting does? Well done young man, well done!
He was definitely raised right ❤️🌻❤️
Great kid.
he is so fine
A beautiful guy
I found a phone as we were leaving the plane in Australia, I chased the lady down and returned it. 2 weeks later I leave my phone on a bench, walk 100m down the road, realise I left it and run back for it. It’s already atolen 💀
At Santa Monica CA I tried to do that but police officer stopped me and charged me that I stole owners wallet . 🤣
I wish we had a lot of people like that that's a great respect
His mother has brought him up really well bless him ❤
It's incredible to see that this is something rare
We need more good stuff in the news like this 🥺
someone returned my purse with over 200 dollars in it :)
you shouldn’t get 3k for doing the right thing, this teaches people to only do stuff for money.
He’s fine
kind of reminds me of that Cop that stopped a kid walking 20 miles to work, Great stories of integrity
Good Kid- there is hope out there
Damn he hella fine
I remember I lost my wallet! I think I have an idea where it was but I couldn’t find it. One day it ended up in the mailbox
❤❤❤❤❤❤
What a great human being he is ❤may he be protected and blessed
Good guy 🏆
Great job young man!..
Still faith in humanity
Good job man
Adrian, you're a legend bro!!
Good lad there should be more poeple like him in the world
What a gigchad
Thank you so much man!
Plot twist: the young guy just want to be romantic to the beautiful woman 😁
Wow we still have hope !
SIGMA.
👍👍👍
I hope I am wrong here but thieves do return stolen items if there is not much value to hopefully gain a reward, would he have returned it if it was full of cash. This world has made me so cynical.
“there’s hope for our future generation” says the generation that ruined our planet and ruined capitalism by perpetuating and tolerating low pay, toxic work conditions, and class systems.
Don’t judge a book by its cover… Great job fam
Imagine if he was a politician :-l
Proud of him so much. Wish I could hug him and his mom. I love good people
Да, только правильное воспитание, способно спасти эту планету ;)
Well he was lucky. I have delivered other peoples stuff many times and just got a thank you! 😅
😇😇😇😇😇😇🙏🙏🥰
I returned a woman's wallet and I didn't even get a thank you. She immediately started looking through the wallet to see if everything was there.
My Mum told me to do the same thing too and last week I found a ladies wallet on the floor in supermarket. I didn’t touch it instead I call the staff to take it from the floor and announce from the information counter. The owner get the wallet back and told that the money was gone and I’ve been accused for stolen the cash! They checked me and glad I NEVER bring a cash on me. Sometimes it’s hard to be a honest person in this mad world!!
He got a good heart, his family did great job.
So nice. Hope he's offered a great job
Whats his ig doe
Now a days is very hard to do Good deeds compared to bad deeds
LEets be honest the guy just wanted female attention
GOOD JOB MOM and everyone involved awesome
His mother raised him good ❤
“theres hope for our younger generation” god there really isnt have you even seen the mfers on tiktok??
Fair play to this lad, fair play to the parents and fair play to these ladies for the appreciation shown.
It’s the snake beside him!! He needs to be worried about!!
Awesome young man!🙌🏼🙌🏼💯
The mother raised him well.
Kind hearted guy. God blessed him
Hahahaha fine young man lol
“Glad he didn’t get shot on their doorstep when he brought it back” was my first thought.
Lets be honest purse was empty but my boy was all in to smash that latina. I would have too!
What a good kid
What a legend
Shouldn't be rewarded for doing the right thing....
Good Boy👏🏻💪🏻👍🏻👊🏻
It just shows that you shouldn’t always judge a book by its cover. I’m surprised that they opened the door. Some people would’ve been hesitant to open the door. Good for him❤️
Adrian Rodriguez, the world needs more people like you! Shout out to your mom❤️
*I’m also a teen*     But tell me why he’s kinda….
Props to his mother raised him right. A good man (Teenager)
Oof! Fine ass 🥵
Bro looks kinda fresh with it
What an HONEST young man he is a credit to his PARENTS
The fact that a good deed was rewarded with 158+ people accumulating 3700$+ bcz he returned a purse while i barely raised over 400$ for my bestfriends funeral when he died in a crash by a drunk driver.
Fake story
Good for him,and the ladies
God bless him for doing right thing
he’s is handsome and respectful and has integrity ❤
That’s the way ..! 😊
BiGG Dogg! 🙏🏽
I'm so proud of him
A few months ago a guy lost his wallet at a pub. There was his mom's phone number in the wallet, she told me they didn't have a car, so I drove almost 40 kilometers to bring it back and he didn't even say thank you. I still feel good 'cause I did the right thing.
She said did you give him $20😢😢😢 🤦‍♂️
Amazing young man!  The world needs more of this fine lad.
He's got the best mom in the world. I wish to God that there were so many more like him.
Hope there not all drug dealers
May the lord be with him always for there I's hope for out children. 👍🏼
Your heart is in exactly the right place sir, the world needs you
Bravo 👏👏👏👏👏❤️
Awesome going sir! Need more like you in this world.
He saw a baddie on the drivers license & thought it was his time to shine. Fair play mate😂
This is staged!Psh
What a nice young man he is been raised right
i remember i was in the mall with my husband we're going home and i saw a cart with louis vuitton wallet and i went to a service counter and when they opened so many ¥10,000 and we're shocked and they asked me where i found it i told them in the cart.but they didn't give me a reward but it's ok i was thingking that time maybe those money need to pay bills in the hospital because it's a lot of money.and im not thingking about the reward either so it's good to see some people do that.
Amazing 17 year Hispanic boy
Wow that is amazing now that kid can buy a Gibson guitar 😐
Aww that’s amazing. Ur an amazing person. ❤ and amazing parents as well. Well done
Adrian Rodriguez is good looking men I might say. Good on you young man.
He got 17k. W
BEAUTIFUL R LATIN AMERICAN KIDS, BEAUTIFUL. IT SHOWS CLEARLY WAT TYPE OF GOOD PARENTS RAISED DA YOUNG GENTLEMAN!
I am shocked that everyone is making such a thing out of it? I am  16 years old and thought it was normal to do that? I would always bring it back??
He the ultimate finesser 🌊
So someone took my wallet form my truck and I cancelled all my cards and got a new id and everything, don’t normally carry cash.  About two weeks later someone left my wallet in my mailbox with a note saying that they had found it somewhere.  They left a number and everything but I never called back or even tried to give them 20 bucks.  I mean i had already cancelled all my cards and got new ones, was I wrong?
Is this really news-worthy? Only in America istg
Who says G's ain't raised right?💯
We all know what type of reward he got at the end 👀😂
[Everyone liked that.]
GOOD YOUNG MAN... GREAT MOTHER.
Faith in humanity restored!  Good job dude!
It's called integrity good stuff
Good kid. Bless him
Good for him man good parenting right there
GOD BLESS HIM! AND GREAT JOB TO HIS MOM 👍😊🤗
The golden rule. Dont judge a book by its cover
3k just for doing something decent? I didn't know we were paying people to wipe their ass now
OUR money.
Na homie was trying to 👏🏼
This is to be compared with a lawyer who saw a wallet dropped by someone going into court. The lawyer was on cctv taking all the money out of the wallet. He was later arrested. Disbarred. Future over.
So everyone has lost all the 'hope' for the younger generations but if a person does the bare minimum faith has been restored. There's no hope for the older generations :'(
❤ This!   Thank you for sharing such a heartwarming story!
His parents should be very proud.
Parents of this lad done a great job….
Look everybody can learn that 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Plus he doesn’t look like the type that would return lost money. Never judge a book by the cover.
Heart warming to see that nowadays. Good job to his mom! She should be proud 💕
Imagine that he stole her purse and then returns it like a good boy for money💀
Good job parents!
I found a wallet in the street once and took it to a police station. The policeman opened it and it was absolutely stuffed full of money and credit cards. There was an ID car, so they could contact the owner. I left my details, but didn’t even get a thank you. 😕
What a great boy his mother raised. 😊
So, that's one of those rapists Trump was talking about???
That's nice so much good karma coming your way young man.
Great story!!
Ngl guy's woulda kept that purse 😂
Everybody saying we need more people like him. Then start doing good deed like him.
I would've given a monetary reward, not 3k out of pocket but at least a hundred. Just the thought of having to replace important cards and the processes involved for each one is annoying.
there is someone honest in usa and it seems to be a senastion. Greetings from Germany
HE WAS TRYNA SMASH, OH WELL, THAT $3K WILL GET HIM SOME 🐱
Ain't happening in sth ldn😂😂
Hats off to him and his parents 👏👏👏
Is this rare for americans or sum? He gave back something that belongs to her, as he should. Would never in a million years make the news where im from.
In germany we say Ehrenmann
my girlfriend recently found a guys wallet full of money and cards, driving license, credit cards etc....she found him on facebook after an hour of searching....when he turned up for his wallet he gave her a second hand old book he brought from his house....lol
yeah, folks,..it's called discipline...dont spoil your kids... this world would be a better place.
Shout out to Adrian good job ma boy!!!!! 😍
One day a gentleman get scratched the front of his car (porsche cayenne) by a woman in a Range rover who subsequently ran away, there were 20 of us who saw the scene, I was left alone to wait for the owner for 30 minutes and warn him of what happened, I had taken the lady's license plate, the gentleman as a reward sent me € 150 of Amazon voucher to my home address.   I didn't expect it, the thing that disgusted me were the people who were indifferent to what happened.
❤
What a dumb idiot for not giving him anything, she probably wants to do it now to jump on the wagon
The Real Hero!
Another POV The boy thought he could smash the MILF 💀
Fair play keep it 💯
very nice, but thats normal behavior . mabey not in the states...
Just remember everyone….   GOD is always watching
God's hand was on that boy and spoke to his heart....what a FINE YOUNG MAN
what nice ladies doing this for him. His mother must be so proud.
That's right...I did that once and was offered $ I didn't take it  because end of the day, doing the right thing karma comes back good. But tbh, this generation is very badly raised not to be so negative, a lot of followers nowadays. This kid is a Leader and will always have God by his side.
That boy drives an Audi. He don’t need whats in the purse .
Well done ladies and the honest young gentleman who did the right act by returning her purse that's what being a gentleman really is and the way the ladies went about repaying the honesty was absolutely unreal that money could go to helping the young man get house down payment or go on awesome holiday with the girlfriend great to see two great honest families looking out for each other and don't know each other
he may dress like an average kid, but he is no average kid.
Real one.
Good guy
Good young man your parents should be proud 💝💝💝
God is watching
Paid actors.
Good lad, now he can buy a belt for his jeans!
That this is on the news says a lot about the US society. Here in Germany it is quite common to bring found things back to the owner or to the officials. I myself experienced it as the one who lost sth as well as the finding person on several occasions.
Cmon guys look at the woman she was hot af. Obvs he thought if he took it back he might lose his virginity lol.
Lost my wallet last month and lost hope I’d have to get a new license, state ID, social security card, bank card, and etc.. nearly two weeks I been helpless risking driving without my license on me. But later a random mail came in and my wallet been returned and I was just the most relieved person at the time. Everything was misplaced in the wrong area but returned even my cash. God bless whoever did the good deed. I thank you for giving me hope of what I would’ve done and how I been raised. I would’ve rewarded the Good Samaritan but they humbly left no return address. I hope you have good things happen to you and may your actions be a good human example of hope and faith 🤙🏾
Guess who 3k up💀
Dont judge the book’s cover😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😹😹😹😹😹
Correction: Do good deeds even if no one is watching? The most important person is always watching -- yourself.
Train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old, he will not depart from it. Proverbs-22:6
Omg he is so cute
"Always do the right thing, even when no one is watching"a good thing to teach your kid!!!
I  L O V E  THIS!!! 🤩 💞 💕 🧡 ❤ And I hope this sets an example for teens & adults out there to do the right thing!!!  It's so nice to see this story, after hearing about so many troubled youth (and adults!) committing crimes & disrespecting people.  Bless this young man, his family, and may this be a lesson to all.
That makes me smile 😊 that young man is mature cause young kids today don’t think like that l take my hat off to this young man Mother bless her heart 💓
This is such a lovely story. This young man and his parents should be very proud
“fine young man” bro got that gofundme rizz
Man whoever raised that kid did a good job 👍☺️
What a great story! Kudos to that young mans parents!
The lad will get a deserved gift from the Butches...
YMYPP <> You Make Your Parents Proud!
Nah he seen she was cute hoping to get lucky 🤣😅
They shoulda team worked him lol
Would prefer a reward from ariana *drools*
W bro.
I don't understand anyone who is not like this, if you can't do the right thin, for any reason, I can't be part of your life.
It was no wallet or purse. I was walking to the store one day lost my ID. Was during the pandemic so you know how hard it is to make an appoinment for anything then. Couple days later someone return it. I was so happy.
God bless you more ❤
He believes good karma
When this is praised and uncommun you know your society is crumbling, where I am from this is just normal
Good job kid
He's a super star! Honestly,  he gives me hope! I wish more parents would take the time to talk with their children, teach them right from wrong and honesty from deceit.  What he did was amazing and I'm so over joyed at how these ladies showed him their appreciation for his actions!
My boyfriend found  $4,000 check on main street and returned it to the address on it. When the man answered the door he asked him if he was so and so guy said yes so my bf said I think you dropped this and handed it back to him. The man took it looked at it and shut the door in his face. Not even a thank you.
Kudos to the young man and his parents !!!
Chivalry, the ultimate rizz
Eliana went overboard with lip fillings 😂
Parenting done right!
Good on him, makes me proud to be part of the human race with this young man.
if it was an ugly drivers license pic my mans woulda ran that debit card up
Stories like this give me hope for humanity that all is not lost.  Well done, young man <3
❤
Even though a lot of stuff like this happens every day, good job returning their stuff, it was the right thing.
gta v bruh
Fine Young Man.
I hate racist America. None of these people watching even realize
The kid seen her picture on her drivers licence and thought he'd like to see her in the flesh !!!  Don't blame him either ☺️
Awesome job young man!  Very proud of him!
is that news worths material in my islamic country you find millions of people who would do this with any intention of rewards. go and search it
Yeah 🅱️®️❤️, way to be strong
Amen 🙏
🙏
So he wasn't there to rob her? Im shocked. Oh right he's not black
If he was B*****k it would have been stolen
All politicians. Please watch this.
I found a bank deposit bag from a small Father & Son business. Had all the banking information & check book and a little over $500 in cash. I returned it first thing the following morning when they opened up for the day. Where did you find it? Oh, thanks. I’m all about karma, granted this guy didn’t buy me a cup of coffee I did what I felt was right. 🤷‍♂️
My Wife found a wallet setting on the gas pump at Costco with lots of money.  It belong to an attorney. My wife returned it got no reward but she knew it was the right thing to do.
You shouldn’t judge a book by its cover
Altruism is evil. Doing what is right and good can be profitable. You arnt always sacrificing self to help others and helping others is most often what is best for yourself.
This kid got exactly what he deserved. And I love that I can say this in a positive light. Kudos to that young man and whomever raised him.
That happened almost everyday in Taiwan. Usually we take it to police station if we found lost items.
They should of gotten him a Belt 🙄
Good job kid 🙏🏽🙏🏽
That what u call karma do sum good and good we’ll come back to u do bad and bad we’ll come back to u one day
I returned a wallet 10 years ago on night out with friends. Not directly to person but to Police. Never heard anything since
I returned a bunch of lost money to a person in a grocery store to not get a thank you 🤣
HE'S KIND OF CUTE 😃💕
At last, some positive news in this world...
Well done Sir! RESPECT💙🙏🌎
I usually skip this part.
I took a wallet I found by an alley, my car got towed thw next day lmaoooo karma
Extremely wholesome
Good job raising your son momma!!! He learned well ❤👍👏👏
That's whats up homie, proud of you for being that guy, respect.
How cool would it be if they offered him a threesome.   Ya never know. That’s why I hand purses back.
milf
Could of at least have Bru some booty fr
He did it cause Eliana bad
In usa he s a hero… In France it s normal… two differents way of life !!!😢
Now future phenomenal man pull those pants up "permanently."👍
He better do something with this publicity.
Young man you made your momma so proud all that Honesty paid off Like a slot machine !
Dude stole the purse to return hoping to see those mommy Milkers one more time
Wow amazing
A credit to his parents. What a fine young man they created if he keeps going as he is he has a promising future ahead. Study and work hard young man the future is yours to make.
Great job son!! God bless you🙏🏻
Awesome kid!
It's the right thing to do. Good on this young man. It's sad that this is the exception these days and not the norm.
That saying is expired EVERYBODY is watching you especially ring doorbells 😉 big ups to bro. Go buy something nice!
🤡💀💀💀
Probably returned it because he saw her license pic and thought she was hot
smart criminal he stole it to return it for a prize and recognition - looks like to his own aunty too
Posted the story but not the GoFundMe -_-
he was sagging too.😂😂
Wonderful young man.
Integrity is the most important asset we have as humans
That's what almost every muslim kid do
bro was tranna smash
Ay yo Adrian...
The results of good education:
He's doing it half right but still chooses to dress like a thug. Not every person will trust a guy based off the way he presents himself
The kid also skimmed the cards and went on a shopping spree with the card info.  Good boy
irespect that young man very very much
I wouldve wanted her never, let me see what that mouth do😭😭😂
Threesome for a new scene
Somebody returned my wallet last week. He tried to keep all my money… didn’t end well for him …
There’s hope for future generations 😂😢
I guess there is hope for humanity if people like this 17 year old boy exist and do the right thing.
This is the one rule, that we all need to live in paradise: the golden Rule! 💕 ☀️
Great young man!
I have kept everything I found and may have even taken things that were not mine.
It would be mad easy to fake this and split the money from go fund me
Wat if he was just hoping to get laid as soon as he saw her drivers license ..
Kid looks like a little g. Don't judge books by their covers
Hope many learn from this brilliant example.
👏🏻
He has a good mother.
He drive an Audi . 3k is chump change
Wholesome
There ain’t no hope, he knew what he was doing 😂
Maybe there was nothing in the bag worth taking or he was thinking of hooking up.
I would’ve accepted a threesome 😅
Good job young man
irs: *HEY BOYY* ...
I have seen someone return a wallet to the owner but getting accused of stealing their money.
I've done that twice. Once in Houston, TX about 20 years ago and in California about 3 years ago. The one in Texas looked at me as if I was crazy when I showed up at his house to return his wallet. He took it, said thank you and shut the door. The one in Cali took my address, said she'd send me something in the mail to show her appreciation, haven't heard from her yet😂 What matters to me is having peace of mind knowing I did the right thing.
This for all them ppl that say hispanics steal. Ya vez pinche cabrones!
Gen Z Gang Gang
I once lost my driver’s license and somebody mailed back to me. Thank you!
Not only is he a great person he also has a cool name
Staged
Nice!
My son and I returned a wallet once. They invited us in for pizza.🥰
As a former scumbag i know how hard it is to give up a score like that. Props kid
I think I would settle for some milf fun as a reward
He just returned the purse cause he thought the girl on the id card looked fit
Young king
aww that was so sweet of him god bless you we need more people like you in this world 🌎
That’s such a cool thing to do from both sides, lil homie must have made his family proud
Mama raise him right
Nicely done, young man!  Kudos to you and your mom! 👏🏻👏🏻
He was raised right ❤❤❤❤
The was a setup for the likes 👍 💀 😂
Really good person 👍
Doing the right thing is it's own reward, used to work at a gas station and found a license on the ground beside a pump when I was getting ready to leave on my motorcycle. Hopped on and punched in the address on the license, was about 25 minutes out of the way but went and returned it, knocked on the door and handed it to a semi-elderly black lady. Didn't even get a thankyou as she took it after I explained I worked at the gas station she dropped it at. Simple replied "Oh, okay.." Took it and shut the door, I wasn't looking for a reward but a 'thankyou' would of been appreciated, I think the younger generation is being raised right, but the older generation has lost it's respect for others.
my son found a neighbors wallet once full of cash, took it to him and the jerk grabbed it out if his hand and slammed the door in his face. it was so rude.
Le hubieran dado un cogidon de agradecimiento, mamacitas
cmon now we know why dude returned it
I love it!
Thank you for your post. What a great story! What a wonderful teen. You guys went out of your way to thank him, and kudos to you too.
That lady has 100 percent of annoyance
I would trust Adrian to manage my funds
17 and driving an Audi?
Restores your faith in humanity.
He saw her ID I bet he liked the way she looked
Awesome!!!
This is why u never judge a person based off looks. Respect to lil folkz 💯💯
atta boy!!!
I commend for the mom great job for raising that kind of person
That was not an adult... That was a child. That to me just makes it perfect.   I hope life finds him well
That’s awesome
Well looks like it grew up in a rich family where would he need more money for 🤣
I've returned 2 wallets to people in the past.  Never rewarded thou
God bless him
Nothing like a story that will make you smile!
Plot twist: he stole the purse also
They look Rich asf I ain’t even surprised +look at that car
I returned a purse to a lady once, it had notes, driver license, credit cards the lot. She just grabbed it and slammed the door in my face! I was only about 12 at the time, I couldn’t believe it.
😊
It's fake
Firme carnal
See thugs? Instead of some nickels he made a real bag, just by being polite 🤷‍♂️
great job dude!!!
I love hot moms 🤦🏻‍♂️😂♥️🔥
This kid was gorgeous and so do his mom!
In a completely empty isle of a grocery store, I found 2 twenty dollar bills on the floor. I looked around and picked them up and put them in my pocket and finished shopping. I got home and inspected them and saw they were wrapped up in an ATM withdrawal slip from an account with only a couple hundred dollars in it. I went to the bank a few days later when it was open and said I was there to return the money and they were shocked. They gave me a few pens, a little eyeglass cloth, and a starbucks gift card with no funds on it. (Bank manager said she wasn't sure if it had money but wanted to give me something). I left my email address in case they wanted to contact me or something. The girl whose money I returned ended up getting in touch and left me a nice card with a $50 bill in my mailbox!
Wheres the footage of them giving him the $ ? Hmmm
Good parent(s)
sigh women
Young man deserves everything he is given for having a good heart
Hilarious. This is being presented as something special.   This is the norm in Korea.
I would have ran
i found a wallet in a shopping cart, it had $500 in it. i returned the wallet and the guy asked me where the money was??? i told him i found it on the ground sir, he gave me another $100 for returning it.. easy $600
What a loverly young lad, he looks so honest as well ,honesty goes a long way in my book and this lad just shows you
Now this young boy was a joy to see. He's going to do fine in life.
❤💪🏿🫡💯
No one wants to have their things lost and stolen.  So glad this kid can see that.
God bless this kid and those who do the right things🙏🏽
In reward, Take everybody in this video across the southern border .....for long vacations 😂🤣😅
Young man with Integrity! God bless him and his family! And to the amazing family that rewarded him!
If You see this man...THANK YOU !!! You help restore My faith in humanity. See so much hatred and division on the news and internet. Your Mother is One of the best!!
Can't even do a good deed anymore without some housewife blasting your identity online for all the internet to see in the hopes it will bring her 15 minutes of fame 💀
OMG That sweet, wonderful young man
Bruh
<IRS has entered the chat>  “Hey buddy, that’s a nice $3k ya got there.”
I returned a lost purse to an elderly woman several years ago who left it in the lobby of her condo.  She accused me of stealing it and slammed her door in my face.
Looks like already got a golden medal for it
Good Samaritan 😊🫶🏻💯
Great job! I know his mama is proud.❤️
This shouldn't be a shock or exception...but a norm. People shouldn't do the right thing expecting reward either !
That lad has a good heart. Well done and your a credit to your mum.
I found a purse once and it had 300$ in it.  I kept it.
There’s hope out there.  I bet his mum is proud of him.
Good lad
Always do the right thing, even when no one is watching ❤❤....damn! someone is slicing onions again
Not every kid taught with good values will do it
Good kid
🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
Wow, both lovely girls. I think I'd do anything for them..........well almost anything. 😉
Don't count on it.  You were blessed with one of the rarest teens around.  It takes a village to raise a child.  Let's keep hope alive.
I woulda emptied it then gave her the purse back
It's a sad state of affairs when a story about someone doing exactly what they should be expected to do, makes the news. BREAKING!: Everyone is not a thief and some people even do good things for others.
It’s a shame that this is held up as a newsworthy story when such actions should be the norm. But yep brilliant work, kid and mom: be proud!!
Eliana is an attractive woman
Hes fine asf
Awesome boy
God Bless him🙏🏽❤️
Any time I lose something I make myself feel better by telling myself, someone else who also needed it got blessed by my loss. 😊
No wonder, she's a milf.. he was probably looking to get some..
I once returned lost phone with so many cards and money on the cover. they gave me 20$ and they were so great full
Thank U lord for some good and kind ppl , Shalom to all Regards from ISRAEL
Das war nett
Don't judge a book by its cover.
He definitely saw the friend and was hoping for a date 😂
wow
Integrity is a rare trait these days! Great kid with a great mom!
I once found $300 in the shrubs with a couple of cards. I identified the owner, who threw it in the bush as he was getting robbed but then couldn’t find it afterward. I got small talk with him as a reward. I tried to stay humble and not be disappointed. Two weeks later, I lost a fanny bag with similar amount  in a big city. A day later I get a Facebook message of a person having found it! I bought her an expensive bottle of booze (which she jokingly said she would want when probed for how I could reward her). The kindness cycles back but asymmetrically.
The world changing guys this is great
Good choice by doing the right thing. 👍
Its a rare act of kindess
I once found a drivers licence in the street and went through a lengthy process of tracking down the owner and sending it back to her. She didn't even thank us.
I found wallet went to address gave man his wallet gave me 150 that was in there he was just happy all his cards he wanted
Not doing crimes pays ...well done kid
Good boy
🔥 Need more Like him (AMEN)💯
A big shout-out and props to his family for raising this young boy right, hopefully it follows along the families next generation! 👌💙
He's exactly right even when nobody's watching, because God is watching and good karma will come his way! 👌❤️
Lock him up and throw away the key, absoloutly disrespectful to the black community
I wonder if he still would have done the same if he found a bag with a million in it...
Let's be real here.. dude thought the purse belonged to a baddie so he returned it trying to get some .lol
Talk about never judge a book by its cover, totally amazing! 🙏😊
A-rod 🤙
Nice young buk
I returned a wallet once because they lived close to me. They were hard working people and I didn't want a reward, but I had to take it because I didn't want to insult their offer, and well, in 3rd world, almost everyone is very hard working to barely escape poverty.
hes so handsome!
I pick a women’s purse outside Home Depot driveway close by the entrance in Woodbury mn and I return it to the Home Depot service n return center. I hope she came back looking for it. If I drop my wallet I would want someone do the samething
An uncle of mine found a wallet. He gave it to me I told him I would go to the address and return it. I asked if he took money from it. He said there were seven dollars in it. I told him to put it back and he said no. I put my own money in it and returned it. The person that answered the door wasn't the guy whose id was in the wallet. He yelled to the guy and said someone brought your wallet. The guy answered if the money was in it. He said yes and they closed the door. 🤣😂 This was over a decade ago when I was a teenager.   I was raised to never accept monetary reward for doing a good deed so I wouldn't have taken any money then.   I'm in my thirties now. Someone give me money. This economy has me struggling. 😂🤣
Good job. Next focus should be to get him to stop dressing like a gangbanger!
Now if only he had the common sense to dress like a non gangster he might have a chance in life.
5 exp points for humanity
Salute sir
The whole world should be like that young man.  He listened to Mama. And kept that Advice  in his head.
Love to see it.  Love this kid
Pass her insta
Not everyone is truly fully or convinced to do something stupid she’s very very lucky 🍀 he bought her purse 👛 back if was someone else they just take everything else money 💰 ID 🪪 and give empty purses 👜 back
Good for him for returning the purse that the women lost for 3k. Not only he was raised right But also he can use that 3k to either buy himself a car invest in school tuition for college/university or crypto/bitcoin. 👍
Parenting: WELL DONE!!
my man.... luv u bruh
3k + the cash in the purse… not bad
Not everyone can afford or justify this for what he did.  I'm glad this was able to turn in to this type of possitive reinforcement for him.
I cry to myself when I'm alone after I do things for strangers without expecting anything in return. It gives me a feeling of having a say in this world and the fact someone's day might just be a little better, makes me happy, no matter how little the favor a selfless act is a selfless act.
So nice
Good for him… hope he doing good right now..
Great job young man, there is hope after all.
I've done that a few times... not for a reward, but because it was the right thing to do
Raised right, live right.  The world is better for this young man.
W dog, hes going right.
There has been 2 instances where I have found a cellphone in the women’s bathroom, luckily it was unlocked so I would call the first emergency number to pop up which has been a close relative. Just seeing the joy and relief on their face when they retrieved their phone made my whole day :) It feels good to do a good deed.
Finally some wholesome news.
I think it's a scam. His friend probably stole the purse so his friend can return it back to the owner.
bro looks like he was the one who stole the purse
Excellent,what a good young man, God Bless him.
His Mom sure taught him to be a great Young Man
His Mom raised him right nd the best part he listened,God is welled pleased
Great job young man we need more people like you 👏
I saw a bunch on money blowing down the road so naturally I stopped and picked it up. I don’t remember exactly it has been years  but it could have been 60 dollars or so.  Drat I though there is a wallet, now I have to return the money So I shoved the money in it. A few days later I was near this dudes house. I don’t think I knocked, but I could have, again this was many years ago.  I either didn’t get an answer or did not try knocking . I do remember shoving  the wallet and money inside the storm door and leaving  I never met him , and I am sure he had no idea who did it. Video cameras where seldom used back then.
I really liked seeing this video of someone doing something good.
That is rare and he deserves every penny! I sure hope that respect and doing the right thing becomes the next FOREVER VIRAL TREND! His mother raised a fine young man!
He is a man of character.
Awesome 🙏
The true gangsta
This was so heartwarming many blessing to him and his parents. Haven had my identity stolen from a coworker and losing my purse finding it later with cash gone, this was a great ending. Nice to hear there is some good out there.
What an amazing kid.  His mom taught him right and “do the right thing even when nobody is watching” is beautiful and words to love by.
Good job homie…!! Keep it up..!!
Probably he returned because it had no money in it 😂😂😂😂😂
Restore faith in humanity
Nice kid. It is a shame that this kind of behavior is not commonplace.
He better than me
Did they smash
As little as this is for once the news reported something good.
I returned a wallet i found not many years ago, had 700 dollars in it, don't get me wrong, i thought about keeping it, but i returned it, didn't even seem thankful, lol.
A good guy.✝️⚘️💙
City Edgars up
W rizz
Sweet 💗
W kid W mom
Thats was up g
I was raised that way also, because even if you find something the finder keepers is just stealing, this young man was raised right and lives by the Golden rule do unto others, what a good example for others
That’s really nice!
A kid raised with some real values. Parents take the time to instill lessons and simple basic values teach ur children to put themselves in others “shoes” These days kids aren’t prepared for the real world
👏🏿🙏🏿👏🏿🙏🏿
If they posted his name and a way to connect….maybe we could all send him a little “something” 😉
no offense, but this teen returns her friends purse…….and she didn’t give him a reward? She didn’t get his name? WTH? 😞😞😡😡. Sadly….Most kids today would have taken anything they could use out of it, and tossed it in a dumpster…..  This young man needs to be CELEBRATED in a huge way!
I have done that several times, and never got a reward. In some occasion not even a thank you.
Good job man! Good job mom, I’m raising him with morals!
Upstanding young man!! He was raised right!
Que admirable sujeto
Wonderful, wonderful story!💎✨🙏
Cool guy. There's hope.
Plot twist : He ransacked the purse but didn’t find anything valuable, so he returned it to not catch a case.
There is still some hope fellas
Blessings to that young man. He was certainly brought up right, just like my siblings and I were by our old-school Mexican family. 👍❤️😊
I woulda went to return it too she probably look like a baddie in her dl photo
He looks like he would have stolen it lol
Faith in humanity slightly restored.
Plot twist: the woman kept the gofundme money
An honest black? Jeepers. This must be fake.
❤
You would never see a black do something like this .
Hell yeah
Respect🙏🏼
I wish I would of piped instead of the reward
Watch all these other kids trying to get rewards now
Dude lost his wallet with cash in it, no one gave it back
What I love the most is that this kid looks like the type to be negatively stereotyped. Goes to show not to judge the book by its cover.
I usually skip past this part.

Well done
It's never a wrong time to do the right thing.... it may not come to you instantly or in the future but it will come to you...
This is funny. They’re actually barely related lol journalists didn’t do enough investigating. Great story making though
If I find a phone or a purse I never give it to the workers. I first try to find and get in contact with the person and then give it to the workers. Sometimes these workers can be shady too.
Hes wifey material🤍
I am so happy for this lady and the young man.  But I could not have accepted the money.
Sweet! He could teach our politicians a thing or two about integrity.
They put it in the news because he looks like a thug I really hate the media
he also got a sloppy topie
Bruv, Homie was there to smash.
Not just good parenting...also a good community. It takes a village to raise good kids into other fine community members.
Fake
Dios bendiga, la honestidad de ese jovencito y de su familia
Pretty sure its coz she's hot
Good kid
Ok, 3k reward or sloppy toppy nutty putty with the two women
My man! This kid is awesome.
I found a guy's wallet at an amusement  park. Gave it to lost and found. Almost got arrested.
Sweeeet!!!!

Good for him!
Disgusting little geek I bet he fed a homeless person and filmed it to get a girlfriend.  I'm worried for this generation  if they won't go have some fun when they find a purse.  Disgusting it's just creepy even the lady said he could have just spent it. Its creepy and social credit systemy. Someone get that kid a blanket
Eliana can get it
This was setup       Bet   Staged     %💯
heres what i hate... " we asked why he return the purse" like wtf theres good people out there
Much respect to this kid, but it’s a sad world we live in when something like this becomes a huge deal on the news. This should be a regular everyday thing.
Kid returned it for one reason.....lol... just saying

Goddamn just for bringing back a purse haha real deadly 🤣🤣❤
God is still at work through good Christian parenting!! Kudos young man!!
What a great kid!! If I could, I would buy that kid a nice Smith & Wesson, snubby. He deserves it ... and he might need one around there!
Lovely young man 👏👏
About time there’s good news about our youth❤ GOOD JOB MAMA
W kid

This Gentleman shows Each of US, We Map Out OUR OWN DESTINY 😃♥️🤩👏✊🙏🏽🦾 Strength, RESPECT, INTEGRITY, Kindness, Compassion, Caring and Love for All People 😅😍🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏽🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏿‍♀️
Eliana is hot
Enough of the kid. Girl on right is banger!!
He stole it and gave it back.
We should do this more and more and more. Let's reward good persons with their good actions. WE never have enough of them.
Very cool all around

Everyone here is awesome. Good guy and nice ladies for returning the favor.
It looks like Dior bag omg!

I would've been like "mommmmaaa, can I have some, some, some...you know... mommmaa"
How did he know it was hers? That doesn't mean he's a good kid 😂
made me feel great switching off now on a high
He is mexican
Nice work young man 🎉
Bro robbed it and returned it 😂
Did the women keep the money they raised XD
He knew the assignment. God will use him to do things that he never imagined himself doing. Good job young man
He looks so cute with the purse in his hand ✋️ may others learn from it. When you don't know what to do. Ask yourself what would God wants me to do? No matter if nobody is 👀 watching, always remember God see everything. I always tell my children got has your recipe. Amen 🙏
A little kindness goes a long way..I hope this video encourages everybody no matter what your age is to do a random act of kindness or do the right thing when the opportunity comes to you without expecting anything in return.
You see, it pays off to be nice to white people. Just be nice esse! Be nice blood! Friendly thug! Hope and love!
Bahahahhahahhahaa where I live it’s just expected that people would do stuff like that… in America it makes the fucken news that people can just be human.
What an awesome young man. His mother must be so proud.
Good kid
Da man 💯✅Homie got heart real leader right there 😎🤙💯❤🔥
I would have gone for a date with Eliana too
imma start ripping off purses and returning em
Some baddies fr 😁
Moments like this help me regain faith in humanity 😊
Definition of don’t judge a book by its cover
Upstanding young man!
Let’s go my boy!!
👊🏼🥂
If he was Black she would have had him arrested and said he robbed her !
Most people would judge his appearance
Raw
I once returned a purse with 5 bank bags in it at a wal-mart parking lot in a cart.. I got a hug. It was worth it.
Very cool! Way to go young sir!
Absolute W
WOW.  Please, more stories like this.  This is all we need in our lives.  Real news.  Thank you for sharing Inside Edition!  And thank you, young man for acting with such kindness.
He's great, but the fact this made it onto the news says a lot about society...
Some employer needs to hire him and fast track him to a leadership roll!
Juat USA things! In Canada it is normal to get what you lost. I am talking about a laptop in the bus. A wallet in the bus, a phone in the mall!
Such a great and sweet story. ❣️❣️❣️
Hats off to you young man your bringing hope that this generation and the next will do the right things!
God bless Adrian 🙏🏽❤️🙏🏽❤️🙏🏽
Plastic face
Excellent job! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
God Bless that kid!
It's f’ed up that this needs to be rewarded and is not just the standard. People suck. Not this kid.
Dude saw the license pic and decided to shoot his shot
Only 17 and hes already a man.
We need to reward honesty in our society! Kudos to the young man!!!
"Always do the right thing even when no one is watching". Just being a good guy who does the right thing has rewarded this young man big time. Cultivating good karma.
If he's 17 and driving an audi; he dont need your money.
Parents should be proud
Awesome!
He probably saw her id and thought she was a smoke show. He was hoping for some ass.
Well raised dude
I hate comments like that, there's hope for our younger generations.. meanwhile the older generations have failed to raised many
Central Cee, what a guy! 🎉
This is wonderful, His Mom is RIGHT
Based kid. Good things happen, y'all.
Speaks volumes to his parents. Well raised.
He probably robbed her saw the prize money then returned it 😂😂
If that femal was a pig he would have been shot
Great story. 🥰
Cool story 👍✌️☮️
That's how a person should be raised
Kudos to his wonderful Mom and to him for practicing what his Mother taught him. He truly is a wonderful young man.
Good and honest young man deserves huge fortunes!
Stole it and his mom told him if he doesn't return it to owner his mom would take away his ps5
That's what I would have done
Excellent Parenting Miss Rodriguez...
the kid saw the photo and thought, MILF
His mom raised him right…proud of you bro❤
What a good guy !
Gangsta
It's cause there was no money in the purse ..
Good Kid❤
Absolutely normal few years back is now a sensation... what a dumb time to be alive
Damn throwing his full gov name out there. Boy finna get robbed.
he saw that i.d and showed up fresh as hell 😂
Now that’s a perfect example of a real human being
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
What a wonderful young man.
Probably had no money in it, to start with.
*Plot twist* it’s his side hustle
On one hand it's nice to see this stuff but on the other it's sad to see that this type of behaviour is seen as special or anything other than what should be usual, as someone who's in their mid teens I really don't think our generation is as bad as people think😂
he’s hot
Respect
Nah he wanted that girls number lol
Thank you for sharing
He saw how good-looking the order was that's what he went to go return it lol 😂
Someone raised him right. Good Kid.
Still good honest ppl in the world
He is so fine omg
His mama raised him well ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Outstanding, young man. Outstanding! A credit and a blessing to your parents for sure.
His Mum has good morals
thats not all she gave him, nomsayin
"Hope for the younger generation." Not really. But there is for some of them.
Wow man what a amazing job brother mashallah
good lad indeed !! I would do the same as my late mum told me that way as well
So cool
Idgaf if I get paid 3k keep the money idgaf ...my christ says to do a good deed I got him..I do a good deed and not get nothing in return
I did this to a news In Norway I got nothing....not even a real thank you....
All that positivity aside... Who wouldnt bring it back? Ask yourself that question before going into the well known "No one would". Because this actually says it all, specially about you!
Years ago my family found a wallet with a bunch of money on the road, we contacted the guy and he came to pick up the wallet. No reward which wasn't a problem the money was all there.  The problem was that he didn't even thank us, we were so disappointed he didn't thank us.
They probably tag teamed him
Yeah remember doing the same tracking down the lady in church and instead of thanking me she thanked God. This lady probably had over 1500 in cash in her bag probably her rent. She said thank god Grabbed her purse and went on to check if we took her money I assume. Make me not want to do it again. If I can go back in time I probably take the cash and buy bitcoin lol😂
Now everybody in the family wanna bite 😂
This kid saw the photos and went there to see what is good with her friend. He was trying to get some
Most important trait Everyone needs is a little bit of *integrity*
People love to be agist, but this kid has more maturity than most “adults” i know.
Groove st, San Andreas. His BMX is around the bush.
Moral culpability is the miracle we gift ourselves.
Cali too? Damn someone has a father
Integrity.....good job young man.
Praise God. Continue to do good things young man. Your mother raised you correctly. Continue to do good things even when no one's looking. “Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he(or she) is old, he will not depart from it.” KJV
Crazy that returning a lost item is normal in Japan or China.
But he stole it
That bag looks like a brikin all I’m saying is she ain’t ever seeing that purse again if it’s a birkin…
plot twist he did take what was in the purse, he just tricked you into rewarding him lmao
Good kid who will grow up to be a great man.
The young man looks a lot like my grandson here in Mexico. I just finished telling him the same thing in chat then  I clicked on this video ❤😊
That boy Is the top G!
You think one person returning a purse gives hope for the people? Lol.
Good on him!
TEACH A CHILD THE RIGHT WAYS AND HE/SHE SHALL NOT DEPART FROM IT.✌☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️⚘🕊
Right on. A good guy.
Beautiful thing
Only latins, no more americans in USA
Always listen to your MOM.
This young men it worth more than GOLD!!!!!!!
I can top that. I lost my wallet and the kid who returned it to me, I gave him my house. Now I am homeless, but I still have my wallet and a few bazooka bubble gum wrappers in the wallet with my favorite comics in the wrapper.    Just kidding .  But that was an awesome thing he did. Glad the female got her stuff back
That’s awesome
Too bad. I've never been rewarded with cash for good deeds...
Well done Adrian.
When i was a 10 year old i found 5 bucks outside of my school. that was a furtune for me - but i went to the school office and gave it to the secretary. When i left primary school a few weeks later, i received a letter containing a savings account with 10 bucks and a note signed by the principal : "Honesty is the best policy". Still have it today. Made an impact on me for the rest of my life. Well done Adrian, his parents, the rewarding persons and all the unnamed ones, who share this kind of respect for society.
I’m proud and I’m not even his dad. Lol
Lol when he makes better fake ids , trying to scope out the competition
The world is a better place because of this young man and his mother…
In 2003 I found a brand new very expensive cell-phone in a mall. I was going to the next phone-shop, asking how much is the new price. It was like 1.000 bucks back then. And I was like "wow". And you know, I did the only right thing:     I put this thing on ebay and sold it for 500 bucks.
God Bless him and his family for raising him the right way.
She was hot that’s why.
Awesome 👏 job
Man stole it and returned it for the prize money 💀💀   Or he's just a fine lad raised well by his mother, which we can clearly see by the way he dresses.
I woulda been tryna tap the aunty
thank God he found the purse. such a good boy
Well this kid sadly will never be a successful politician, lawyer, real estate agent, salesman, doctor, or Verizon phone store employee.
He did the right thing and it was lovely that the family put together some reward money for him
Plot twist: he had already burned up the credit cards in footlocker before he returned the purse 🤣
a Hisoanic, our mom's taught us better.

he fine too
Well Spanish people stick together that's good 👍🏾
good. He was rewarded
dont expect to get this reward! i did the same at his age, I was jobless with a sick demented parent at home. I retrived a baby... and a wondering lost child on two occasions to their parents. instead pf at the very least (thanking me!) they just turn their back in embarrassment imagine that. MY INSTINCT SCREAMED! they intentionally left their child somewhere! THE FILTHY PEASANT SCUM IN EUROPE. BLACK FOLKS AND ALL SORTS OF WHITE TRASH! BTW! the real hero... is the woman who granted that child an oversized reward of 3k at 17! that's my drivers license and a car! on GOD my life could've been so much different and so much better. THAT"S A GOOOD GOOD WOMAN RIGHT THERE! GOD BLESS HER!
A military CORE VALUE INTEGRITY!!
She defined Discipline.  This kid will go far in life.
Outstanding young man. This video would serve as an incredible personal reference!
Melina is pretty AF
Good job young man 👍
Porque usemos gorras ., tattoos y un estilo diferente de vestir no significa que seamos malas personas …. Muchos podrán ser bandidos pero con una mejor educación y crianza que muchos con dinero pero les falta educación 😈💪🏻✌🏻
This kid is 1% of the 1% of people his age that would actually do this.
Excellent, and no doubt he treated his mom with his reward. 👏👏👏👏👍❤️🇬🇧
Please. That Finnadookie was looking to impregnate somebody. A bag with with "John Smith's" belongings in it never would have been seen again.
What a lovely Lad Parents should be proud of him
There is still hope for humanity, good job for doing the right and decent thing my man.
Parents raised him right. He keeps this going when he marries and has children the world will start getting better
Very honest young man that is beautiful you don't see that very often
Also the fact that it was not him making the video of him returning the purse for likes / media , makes this more satisfying ........I hope he gets over 5k
Awesome for this young man. Honesty does pay! 😊👍🏼
This is like the western edition of the Chinese propaganda fake videos? It's so hilarious
PUSH!!!
Good man 💪🏻 He’ll find success in anything he does
Do you mind taking this purse and returning it again for 3k?         Then returning that 3k again ;)
Very good young man. ❤🥰
❤️‍🔥
Amazing to see purity in a massively confused and depressing world! Great job buddy!
I Thought That Was Central Cee 💀
Did the same thing once. The owner accused stealing ja threadned calling police. Next time i take the money and throw wallet into ditch…
We need more people like him
OMGoodness!! What a wonderful young man!!💗💗 And, to the AWESOME Mom who taught him well--thank you!!💕
He better then me I would had took her identity and bought a house in her name😂
Who forgets a purse???🤦🏾‍♂️🤣
Well I am from a different part of the world but I'm completely shocked how this is a news story and why this teen is rewarded so much? Isn't this just normal behaviour? Seemingly not... in the states
nice lad
Good deed!!
This is staged, I mean look at that mf
Adrian a real g for that
Now that's a good whippersnapper. 👍 looks like the kid who respects my lawn and doesn't walk on it. I approve 🇺🇸
He returned it because she's hot. He could see the driver's license lol. Otherwise he would have left it with the grocery store.
I need to start stealing purses just to later "find them" to bring them back
He can buy some decent clothes now. 😉 Good on him, raised the right way.
There is nothing wrong with kids today! Just like adults, some have honor and some don’t 🤷🏻‍♀️
The sad reality is, even though this is a very good deed and it should be seen as such. This planet is in such a state that just doing something like this is considered above and beyond and the fact it wasn't stolen by the person to be applauded... What a state we live in that common courtesy and human decency is actually a rarity. Good on this kid for keeping some of my faith in humanity...
Love to see it. Especially coming from the youth!! He was raised RIGHT❤
What a great lad. Obviously brought up right by his mother. Others teenagers watching this Take a good look at this kid as goodness overcomes badness every time. Mick Ireland 🇮🇪
That kid was raised right.
I would’ve asked for a 3 sum hahaha
Bless his parents must be so proud 🥹 💗
He probably stole it
He was tryna see wassup with her in person kuz she BAD 😆😍
Ok I’m late….but LOVE that he got the recognition he deserved! And BRAVO MOM!!
😂 he just seen the driver’s license, and wanted a price of that mama cita haha
Great job young man.
I wonder what the real story was...
Here we go! Finally social media pushing positivity! We need more of this!!!!! As a huge news source, I beg you to set the scope on this type of content!
They're cute damn
Happy to see Good News today. Mahalo Young Man for the right thing to do way of life
What a great story!
He seen how fine she look and was tryna get lucky😂😂lol
I have been in this very situation a couple of times and every time I returned the wallet or the purse I found in a shopping cart I felt so amazing being the one to find and return it to the owner. It’s a feeling of self satisfaction and community love that just can’t be compared. I’m so proud of this young man who was raised to do the right thing. It’s so much work to replace your identification and everything else that we carry around. God bless all who do the right thing.
You can see , wear as a gangster or have tattos means nothing , heart has the first and the last word always before judge someone
"Integrity is doing the right thing, even when no one notices."  C.S. Lewis
Fantastic...👏👏👏
⭐️❤️⭐️❤️⭐️❤️⭐️❤️⭐️❤️
😁l did the same thing 😠and didn't get a thing 😜but that's ok because then l found a bag of money and l didn't give that back 😆🥴l just run home so happy 😆😜🙄 what was that o might one don't let the world know 😁ok 😆😜😂😝🥴🤪
So sweet
Plot twist he checked the purse was nothing worth stealing 🤣😂🤣
Good man, but isn’t it a little sad that there’s a literal NEWS story about someone doing the right thing? Something that we shouldn’t even have to think about ?
His Mom taught him well.
I Love this story!
That was a brave thing for him to do 😳
I congratulate the young man,but I'd also like to commend his parents, for bringing him up,right.. God bless you all..
Why didn’t they pay him out of their own pockets instead of having random people do so? They have a nice Mercedes in the driveway so clearly have the means.
That’s first an last time you will ever see that
I found a woman purse and gave it to security + team members at the store that I found it at.. I’m hoping they gave it back to her.
See, it does pay to be obedient, honest, kind and considerate!  I know his mother must be very proud!  I don't even know him and I'm proud.  There is hope for our young people.❤❤
I would of asked for a threesome instead of 3k lol
Great kid!
He was raised right
Kid has integrity...  Bravo
The fact this happened in Cali really does restore my faith in humanity
Just wondering if the good deeds have become so scarce that everyone r so touched by simple acts of honesty and humanity...isn't it supposed to be very common....am I thinking wrong??? Or is goodness a weakness
Wow you don't see much people like him now a days. Especially teenagers. I would've rewarded him also. Plus he took his time and Gas ⛽ to go the location.
That was beautiful thanks for sharing this. We need more of this in our world . It goes to show you good still exists
this is so normal were i live. funny that it warrants a news article in america lol
🙏♥️♥️♥️
Nice. Now he can put a down payment on another Audi!
that dude look like a thief who stole the purse and felt remorseful and decided to return it so he wont go to jail
💚💚💚
Beautiful ♥️💯
It is so refreshing to hear GOOD news about young people!!! I love this. thanks for reporting
Excelente blessings 👍🙏❤️
How in the HELL does a grown woman leave her BIG ASS GREEN PURSE in a shopping cart without immediately noticing she doesn't have it.
Lord Jesus protect this young man, may he continue to show your virtues and be a leader among his peers.
Good for him
What a damn good kid!!!!!!!
That's right foo show em we more than a stereotype
THE ONE THING I believe that keeps us from coming together as a society IS OUR HEALTHCARE that doesn't care about anyone without money, our system doesnt care, why should individuals?
EXXXXXXXXXCELLENT!!!!  What a FANTASTIC young man with a FANTASTIC MOTHER!!!!  And I'm SO GLAD that he was so smartly and GENEROUSLY rewarded!!!  So glad he got that much!!!!
Well done, young man.👏👏👏👏
Absolutely a properly raised young man.  God bless you sir, I wish you the best you deserve it 0:59
Okay but he is FINE
yeah this kind of behaviour should be a standard not a thing to report on as amazing
Great to hear this today from young kids.
That's so sweet of him
That young man is has good heart and really kind ! Awesome
Good on him
Amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah 🙏🙏🙏 Thank you Soldier's of God
I “lost” my wallet 22 years ago with $248 in it.Searched anywhere & everywhere.. Received it 7 days later In mail from Phx w/ all $$.. WHO DOES THAT?🙏🙏🙏Thank You
“ Always Do the right thing even if nobody is watching!”🎉🎉🎉
Kid must be Republican.
Wow
This definitely gives me hope for the newest generation that listened & learned from their parents, & definitely know the difference between right from wrong. 💜
He went out of his way because he's a good man.. wtg
I'm a teenage boy, and I see the pic of this woman, I'm driving to their house as well.
She's got more plastic than skin on her face lol. I'm glad the guy got rewarded for being good. Hopefully it encourages others to be like that. Even if there's no reward
Boy it would be nice if we could get him through his first year of college 💗 I'm heading over to donate myself.
How heart warming ❤️
Just lost my wallet last December 22,2002 and Then i discover $4000 dollars taken from my bank account by them using my debit card to send cash app money to themselves and their friends which totaled like $4000 . I was so heart broken especially since it was 3 days before Christmas and couldn’t buy anything and buy people presents . My gf even got mad because I know she thought I was lying just so I don’t have to buy her a Christmas present 🤦🏻‍♂️ i felt so bad.i wish it was this kid who found my wallet .what a awesome young man .
Awesome job Buddy! 💙
❤❤❤
Ive done this many times? Where is my three thousand
Yes he was raised right he's a good kid
Another awesome young man! I just watched a video on the young man who stopped a creep who was aiming  his attention on a young girl at a Target while her mother was in the restroom! The guy said weird stuff then took off and into a waiting car! Disaster averted! Great hope and expectations for this awesome upcoming generation! Thank you!
Screw the money, I need the threesome. And maybe like $60
This world is in real trouble if this good deed is not the norm
MILFs
Where I come from this is normal behaviour. Hardly the second coming 😂
Massive well done to this young man 👍👏👏👏
I love it.
Good lad . Comes from good parenting.  He hopefully will continue that way and he teaches his kids to do the right thing.
He come from a good family,  good bless him
This is such a sweet story 💗
Damn I wish I was that guy. I Gotta stop mugging grandmas.
Doing the right thing when no one is watching. That is INTEGRITY.  Well done, Adrián.
Sad that this is a story.
Eh he was just looking for a date..this method and a puppy work best
I love seeing good things happening in the world.
Amazing! We need to see more of this. I'm so sick of the news being flooded with horrible things.
❤
Great job kiddo
That’s a good kid - here, let me give you a little trinket of my appreciation
Im over here thinking " steals rich peoples dogs the wait for reward poster" 😂
Proud of this kid. This shouldnt be news; it should be the norm
“My mom told me to do the right thing even when no one is watching”
Great job to ma man
20 vbucks 😂
Good job kid and yes there is hope For this generation ❤
That's a good kid!
What a special young man!  🙏💜🎶🎼
متعجبين شنو هذا قليل يصير يمهم
I usually skip this part.
I found a purse at Kroger and turned it in to the service desk . I had thought about returning it to the owner personally but quickly realized she would go to Kroger service desk once she realized it was gone. It was Christmas Eve.
Strong Foundation, impeccable Integrity His praise to his Mother my respects to his PRINCIPLES 🙏♥️
Good people come from good people .. up to a certain age we have to teach core values and when they get older they use moral compass to make choices! This kid is on right track!
you see education starts at home, parents now days need to do the same here in California
I'm not gonna lie. If I saw this young man at my doorway I would be suspicious. Just when you think 5 guys will be jumping out of the bushes to ambush you.... it turns out the kid is one of the good guys. The lesson I learned from this video is not to judge a book by it's cover!
Nega edgar
*”Always do the right thing, even when no one is watching”.*  The very embodiment of INTEGRITY. Great job young man.
Adrian is high class all the way! I wish my kids to be like you.
I wonder if he went through the purse 👜 first , just to see what was in it , then return it .
he probably saw how bad she was on her ID and said yeah i’m gonna go find this girl 😭😭😭😂😂😂😂
Reverse racism guilt. If it was some old white lady that brought the purse back I don't think there would be a $3,000 award. Maybe I'm a cynic. Good thing the young man was raised right though, the world needs more decent men.
There was nothing in the purse that’s why he brought it back lol people don’t think lol 😂 😂😂😂😂😂 yea nice kid
Good young man
Sad state in our world that doing the right thing is newsworthy. Good on him though.
Did somebody order a purse? 😂
Really insane he got rewarded with 3k I once return this lady wallet with all her money, credits cards her ID you name it and I could’ve toke the money Nd dip buh I didn’t I went home told my mom Nd we search for her address which she live the next block to our house Nd I returned it to her mom and got 10 dollars 🙂. Bro got 3k for returning a purse nd went onna news 😂😂 krazy how life works is people who do this Nd don’t even get noticed lol
That's cool I like that. Nice story. Not to mention Its a Pain and headache to get all your stuff reissued. Glad to see he did the right thing his mom teaching him good morals and he listens to his mom.
i cant believe this is supposed to be a big deal lol
FAKE.  STAGED STORY
Love this. As a parent, you would hope that your children will always do the right thing when no one but God is watching. I am very proud of this young man. I am sure his family is as well.
Gotta be careful. You may think you're doing the "right thing" by returning the purse to the owner, and luckily, he found a very grateful couple. But more often than not, the owners will report you for stealing. It's best to just let the store know and give them the purse. Make sure they keep the video recording so you have proof that nothing was taken. These days, you have to dot your I's and cross your T's
That’s amazing!!! Good parenting!! I raise my child to do exactly the same thing! Even when no one is watching!!❤️
His mama so proud of him
Central cee doing good things. keep it up bro
Pls great to watch this is very nice young man, appreciated.
This is giving me diabetes
I found a wallet once with multiple ID cards and credit cards inside and I drove to the house to return it to the old Indian lady. They all scrambled to give me an incentive reward and I walked out of there with a handful of change amounting to less than $5. I was happy I did the right thing but a little offended. Was in highschool at the time 😂
That was good that he did the right thing, but he needs to dress like a man, not like someone who steals, sells drugs, and kills people.
I once lost my wallet with all my cards, documents and some money inside a bus. Few days later a guy reached out and said he had found and would give it back for what it was about 10 bucks equivalent. We met at downtown in my hometown, I paid and got my wallet back with all but the money inside lol. That's Brazil though so to me was a good deal.
the woman who just took the purse without not even asking for name and number was not raised to be grateful
John 3:3-Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. John 3:7- Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.  John 3:16-For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. ✝️🤍🙏🏼
Good kid. Was raised right. Not enough of them around these days.
💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾 Salute da young soldier….I’m from Daygo….really appreciate this young man……
Good job young man 👍🏽
Way to go Adrian!
Awesome kid!
I’ve had a similar situation, I had left my wallet on roof of my car it fell off near a school and a gentleman around the corner from me found it and RETURNED EVERYTHING I HAD IN WALLET😊 If you’ve ever done this you know it’s a SIK FEELING!! I offered him $$ but he wouldn’t take any. He’s a TRUE HERO IN MY BOOK!! Thanx again STEVE
Awesome job bud. God bless you
Good job gets holy rewards
Amén buddy....PR
Mom and Dads matter.  When groups have 80% of families with no Dad in the home, it is a disaster.
I love positive stories like this❤ Outstanding young man🎉
I like the effort to encourage such behavior, nice, what good young man👍
Hero!
I love how the one woman took the other woman's thunder
Very respectful
Upstanding young man.
Would it have the same outcome if she was white? I highly doubt it.
I returned someone’s phone because I found it in the street and it had all of her money and divers licence in so I went to her address and I refused to take the 5 pound but she told me if I could take it
Aye yo….Eliana single?
The real question : did he smash ??
Les parents peuvent être fière de lui 👍
my brother found$6,000.00 in a parking lot. he picked up and just sat in his car,waiting. soon lady came out looking around all panicked. he said loose something? she said yes $6,000.00. he got out of gave her the money and walked into store doing his shopping. never looking back.
This is the way the world is supposed to be.
Finally, some parents raise a kid good. Even though, he looks like gangsta from Barrio Logan good for him
Absolutely no hope for the TOK TOK generation.
That's a good kid. "Do a good thing even no one is watching!" SOMETHING YOUTUBERS NEED TO LEARN! They do good things ONLY to have something to post!
Great kid, obviously had good upbringing , his parents must be proud!
Way to go Adrian, spread the good!!  This Mom is soooo PROUD OF YOU!!!
What a great kid, but doing the honest right thing should be the norm not the exception.
A very noble young man. 🤌🏿🤌🏿🤌🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿💃🏿💃🏿💃🏿Just think if we all were that noble. 🤔
Bro returned a bag and earned a big bag in return! You can buy a car with that
Nicely done, young man. When I was about his age, I did the same. I was walking home and found a wallet and its belongings scattered across an intersection. I gathered up all of the items, and called the lady. When we met, she kept looking at me and around to see if there were others hiding somewhere, lol. She tried to give me some money but I told her is was not necessary. She was just absolutely in shock. I really didn't think much of it. Just trying to do the right thing.
my boy could fit so many profiles, but "do gooder" definitely wouldn't be one of them. his parents raised this young boy right.
I did the same thing when I was a kid. I found her purse under some debris in the woods. I was using a metal detector. I walked over to her address and returned her property. She told me she was relieved as her social security card and other things were in the purse and the thief only seemed to be after the cash. She asked me where I lived, I assumed to recieve a letter or something. Every day after school I checked the mailbox out of excitement, to hear back from her. Nothing ever came. I guess as a kid I needed a little affirmation. What these women did for him is very special. They wanted him to know how much that gesture meant to them. And those around them. Very cool
I would hire that young man in a second
Superstar 💫
The world needs to hear more stories like this and less about corruption
Whenever someone does what is right the right thing is reward them.     There is hope for the world we lost of honesty. 😢
I agree it says a lot about his character
Plot twist: he stole the purse
Good honest man !
Good job young man !!!!!
Honestly, this kid seems nice.  Why is he dressed like a felon?
Love how he made a huge come-up from doing the right thing. If he kept the purse and sold it off he probably would have had 100 bucks lol
It’s so refreshing to see a young man of his age doing the right thing, let’s hope others follow in his footsteps ❤
This is a wise man. He was raised perfectly ❤
In California of all places lmao
❤❤❤❤✊✊✊✊❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Equally, if he would have taken what was in the purse to help him and his family survive, that too would have been fine.
Oh he got 2 milfs
The kid just wanted the owner's friend.
Very cool proud of you young man
Good man
I would take him out to lunch or dinner then 20 dollars
Good one bro
He made his mom proud...  a fine young man.
What a decent young man 👍👍👍
It starts with the parents folks. Well done to mama Rodriguez.
A shining example of the Golden Rule. "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."
This is a really good kid😊💜
Beautiful & perfect parents….a perfect young man.🙏🏽👌
So good to see.  Good job young man.  Sometimes the reason is plainly that it's the right thing to do. His parents must be so proud.
What a beautiful BLESSED story great job young man parents we all need to step it up for our children and help make this world a better place AMEN BLESSINGS TO ALL GREAT VIDEO 🙏🏽💜
Good deal
No way they gave him 3k like dat vrooo
The lady on the right is so fine 🥵
Plot twist: all three of them were in on the gRift and made a cool $1200 each from go fund me
🤙🤙🤙Good job bro🤙🤙🤙
Lookin like a OG but bein a good boy. N1 !
I hope this shows ppl u can dress a certain way and still be a good person
Buen chico good boy
Was nice the way woman act cause in other cases is not the same even when the person did not take any belongings
That kid has terrific parents. Well done and I hope this kid has a bright promising future and successful life.
What’s up with the lady in black 🔥🔥
Great young man
Fake
I would take the money in the purse and then return the purse.... And say I found it like that
Nice
Excellent job young man, your honesty and the way you were raised has paid off. Keep up the good work, you have a very bright future ahead of you.
i love him
Made his mum proud zxxx
3k damn 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
Awesome..
I hope he gets to a much better place in life.... God bless....
Cool, bravo kid and big thank you for listening to your mother. This used to be normal but drugs did what they did to our society and it’s funny how it’s excepted as if it’s ok. If I have power I would have death penalty for drug trafficking 100%. Think about it for a moment, I know it sounds “over board” but look around…Once upon a time this was a dream land, it’s turning into a nightmare right before our eyes and when we see something like this we actually all jump and want to encourage it  when honestly this was just a right thing to do!!! Anyhow credit to a kid.
Instead of what do I want, he said what would I want.
Great kid. If it had been me, I am not tempted to steal a little money but to be too selfish to be inconvenienced to make the trip. He set an example, wow.
I just had £4000 I had saved for my child stolen from me by the one person’s I should be able to trust most in the world. Seeing this makes me even more disgusted that he did it.
That’s my boy, he stole it and gave it back lol 😂
The kids parents should be recognized for raising a good boy. That is rare these days
A great Mom.. may karma follow that MAN.. he's no longer a teen.!  Some become real men early!! Bless you!
What a great young fella.
Did u even give him 20
I would've wanted her friends number lol
anyone know the moms @ strictly for academic purposes
Great kid ❤
3k for them ladies is like 30$ to us lol
This is beautiful. All I've been seeing lately here in Australia on line is youth crime going way out of control. It is wonderful to be reassured with this ray of hope. Blessings to this young man and to the two women.
Reward his mom
Melina fine though 😂
Now he can buy a gold chain
Great deed, young man. ⚘️👍🏽$⚘️
bruh im taking the money & dumping the bag
Well, he looked at the photo identification and thought Damn! Gotta meet in person! Good on him
Damn for her I would have bought it back 😅 lol hehehe
Any to get noticed
why he went out of his way to return the purse😅
Definitely deserves the 3k and I hope he continues to do great things in his community.
All the moms and younger girls sweating over him
We should get more videos like this
I’d just want a date🤣🤣🤣
He prolly stole it and returned it for the reward
Great guy I would of blown it
👍
THANK GOD HE WASN'T A BLACC ....HE WOULD'VE SOLD DOWN TO THE PURSE
That's awesome! His mother did a great job,  and his character speaks for itself!
Awesome young man! This gives me a big dose of hope!
GOD IS ALWAYS WATCHING, BELIEVE ME.
I'd want a threeway if I were him.
Wow. Melina is looking mighty fine.
This talks a lot about the lady that lost the purse. Only reason she gave and raised money for him was because of the goodwill of others that saw his actions.
Good kid!!! I KNOW my grandson WOULDN'T DO IT!!! Unfortunately!
Sucks that society is getting to the point that doing something like this can be bad decision-making and possibly get you in trouble
Made me cry! Proud mom!!
What a good young man.  I love to see things like this.
What an awesome young man. I hope he gets a scholarship to college. He represents the best of us
Don't judge a book, etc.,etc......
GREAT JOB!!
Beautiful
Maybe his parents teach him good raise . He show respect. He find purse check ID address ( not steal )  ( knock in the door ) .  That’s nice .. He find and give to women . God bless to him .
Nice…. Nice
if he was black it would have played out different
Nice 😊😊👍👍
if you want to learn english,,, i think the wrong place to go is to USA,,,, all spanish accents there
❤
Someone find his @ rn. 😭
he only returned because she was hot
Many years ago I was jobless and about 2 weeks from being homeless. I found a wallet at a filling station, it had enough money in it to pay my rent and a bit left over for food.  It was someones whole paycheck. Or so I thought.  I looked up his number, white pages there were no cell phones in those days, and called him. Let him know i had his wallet and he should come get it.  Well, long story short.  He owned a lawn maintenance company. I had explained my circumstances and he hired me on the spot.  I worked for him for several years before we both went our separate ways.. all amicable.  He was a very good boss.
Never judge a book by it’s cover.
I love this kid❤
This 17 yr old has more integrity than most adults💜💜💜
Adrian youre the  best kid in southern Cali.
He was raised right, however he was the one who did the deed.  Respect to this young man; Thank You.
DAMn... the parents did a great job. The 17yr old deserves praise and a lot of respect.
God bless him
So PROUD of this young man! BRAVOOOO 👏👏👏👏
I would have choose a dinner date with this 2 beautiful women ❤️
he’s kinda..
Cool story
The kid must be Catholic ♥️🪔♥️
Well done, young man.
This guy's father definitely lives old school honor. I've seen that in several Mexican fathers. I gave a kid a couple quarters once so he could play pinball, he ran off and 10 minutes later his dad led him back by the hand and made him give me the quarters back. He did that because he didn't want his kid to learn how to beg and to never take charity. I've been inspired by that man just by his actions ever since.
It’s sad that the owner didn’t give him the reward and has to ask strangers to give him a reward. She didn’t even seem that appreciative to that nice guy. Very sad.
Love to hear more news like this ❤❤
Good Man Good Job
Heart warming story.
He was trynna hit
Yes, definitely there's still good ppl in this world and this young man is prove of that.  Back in the early 90s I found this wallet at a train station in NYC. I immediatelly looked for some ID with a phone #  to see if I could give it back to its owner. I found a veteran hospital ID card with a pic of an elderly man, some other papers and $15 in cash. No phone # but it had a postal address in Queens. I thought about sending it through the mail but without my address bc I didn't want to be compensated. I just wanted to make sure he got his wallet, with his money and everything else he had in it and that was it.  Then I thought about the possibility of this person not living there any longer and his wallet getting lost so I put my return address just in case.  Two weeks later I got a letter in the mail with a note from this person thanking me for my gesture, saying something to the effect of "you're a very decent person, not many ppl would take the time to do what you did". It also included a money order for $30, just what I was trying to avoid when I thought about not including my address on the package. I sent him his $15 and he sent me $30.  That's what I was taught at home when I was a kid  and that's how I still am at 65 yrs old.
In addition, he saw the picture on the ID, and said, yoooo....she fine af. Lol
stay the course young man.  You will live a rich life.
Don't be naive. Everything was planned. They know each other.  That's the new kind of  scams. Be careful and do not believe everything you see and hear. Sad, but it's true.
God bless you brother!😇
In a test a few years back wallets were left on the street to see how often, of at , they would be returned. All the major cities were k course, a percentage of returns tracked at each   In only one major city was the wallet * always * returned, doing better than medium and small towns tested.  Chicago. All the wallets were returned in Chicago.
Amen
What a fine young man
awesome
🥲✊🏾
God bless this young man!  Praise to his mum!
😮
Great example of good parenting. The older I get the smarter my parents were.
Amazing ❤️
Rather have hour with the owner 😋
They could reward him in another way….
Rare breed !!!
Good Young Man, exactly the type of Person who will never become a Politician
It feels far better doing something good for somebody , than doing something bad 🌎
Ok ok ok BUT TELL ME WHY SSSNIPERWOLF HAS MORE SUBSCRIBER'S
Someone found my purse once and turned it in to the police department. Everything in it . From that day , I vowed no matter how hard life is for me I will always do the right thing . ❤
In muslim country this is normal thing
When you live in a country where doing the right thing is news ...  I'm so very sorry for you all.
Kama is a real thing
Good man
Lame.
In Hawaii it call being pono Do the right thing even when no one’s watching 🤙🏽😁
Amen. We need more of that and people like this in this world.
Mi hermanito Que Dios te bendiga...🙏🕊️🙏
My hubby found a new iPhone in the public bathroom at the beach and then about half an hour later the owner of the phone called that phone to find out where his phone was my hubby answered the phone and told the owner that he had the phone and told the owner where to meet so he can give the phone back to the owner 😊
Good things happen to good people.
Imagine what the world would be like if everyone was like this kid.
Nice to see this.  This is how I was raised as well.
Unbelievable. Good guy man. 👏.
Good job….his mom should be proud. He was raised right.
Pretty eyes on left
Looks like a gangbanger but was genuine enough to do the right thing. Can't judge a book by its cover
Several years ago I found a ladies purse in a shopping cart in a mall parking lot. It had $1,600 in it. I got the address off of the ladies driver's license and drove it to the apartment. The lady answered the door and I handed her the purse. I literally did not even get a thank you.
Damn ive found hella stuff i never got a reward 🫠
They let him hit.
we need more videos like this
Can't judge the inside by the outside looks. Young people always have and always will and should dress how they want. You act like that you can wear anything you want. Well done young man and your parents.
Yes finally some positive news. Parents taught him right.
It always starts at home, raise those young gen full of love and respect and this is what you'll get.
Bravo young man..Bravo!
FLAT EARTHERs next thing you will be saying is that the sun is a corn flake
So sweet ♥️🌹♥️
Good job to his parents. They got a well raised man in there ☺️
Good man
FINALLY someone gets a reward for returning something ❗😌👏👏👏 About time. 👍
Amen 🙏.
That's why people shouldn't judge anyone by the way the look or dress or anything
Good guy hope he's doing well
😊😊😊🫡🇺🇸
I've returned wallets with over 1k in cash more than once, all to young people. It's called being Canadian.
Acts of kindness will be ALWAYS worth more than money both of them have a heartwarming outcome now!
News rlly has nothing else better to report nowadays
Wao my respect to this young guy 🙏✅👏 God bless him always .. keep on doing what’s right on this world so messed up … you set yourself apart .. simply amazing … 🧡
I once found a wallet that had over $800 in it when I was like 14. That was over 20 years ago so, yeah, I honestly had serious urges to keep it, but ultimately turned it in after I had counted it all out and the owner ended up giving me $40! In the end, the $40 and the good feeling I had was worth much more than the $800+ that was inside that wallet.
With all the insanity going on this put a smile on my face. There is hope.
Let’s go finally a legitimate reward
As my grandfather would what a  fine fellow he is
I've probably done this 5 times in my 41 years of existence.  Never got a penny. This kid returns one purse and gets 3K
im pretty sure we can raise money for better reasons..
You have made a lot of allies, my young friend. You always have friends here. Hail, from Reno, Nevada
"There's still hope for the younger generation" lol What? Good way to generalize them all and not how they were raised.
Hell yeah Adrian 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
👏🏾
He got some from the aunt 😂
$3000 for a purse?  He should have looked inside.  Must have been some good chit in there, man.
On top of it being the right thing to do he saw the ID and was like this lady is hot so imma go drop this off.
I'm surprised 9:20
Good lad, he's obviously been brought up well.!!!
🙏🌝
He could teach some teens a lesson on honesty
The best part: He doesn't look like a civilized individual who would DO the right thing.
What a great teen , the world needs more like him .
We proud of you foo
Good stuff.
This is hope that will make America great again!. I've found a lot of money and returned it. That's how normal people act in a society that we all want to live in. I hope the rest of you will at least consider doing the same thing as this kid did! ✌️ Peace!
He can afford a belt to pick up his pants now. Thugs can be nice at times
He definitely drove it there hoping to get some cheeks
God bless you for doing the right thing ❤❤❤🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾💯💯💯💯💯☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾
You know how many times I've done this and got shafted by people saying give me your info I'll reward you lol and nothing but it's the thought that counts I guess
Response funny cute always do right thing when no one watching but great I’m a good person too I wouldn’t take chance to steal and catch a sentence
Good thing they were the same race
Commendable
this place needs people like that to spread positivity around ....
👏🏽 Salute to him and great job teen’s mom! You raised him well.
Okk
That's real cool the see 🏆 may God bless him 😇
Well done!!
mans was tryna get lucky hehe
I did the right thing I can sleep good at night I would do the same thing
My mom since I was little always told me to do the right thing even when no one's watching. Wise encouraging words right there. Someone's always watching though !!
This is just good all the way around.
Love 💘 everyone ❤ 💕 💗 💖 💓
Plot twist he took it 😂
Great young man.
honest latino kid, proud of you,  he is different from other latinos
Arent rich people so cute when they spend money taht doesnt matter just to get attention? Ya'll lesser minds keep feeding into it.
I found hope again, a little bit in our younger generation seeing this. This dude is gonna be an awesome man if he keeps that mentality.
He deserves every cent.
Lot of plastic in that face
Always do right thing.
And then a month later these ladies get robbed by the same guy
Was that a goyard purse?
He'll be able to go buy some drugs now 🤣
Nice
Good upbringing ❤
His a wonderful young man👍👍👍👏👏
Wow great story
What good young man. His parents and family should be very proud of him.🙏👍❤️🇺🇸👍👍👍
always do the right thing even when know one is watching. dammmn
I was teaching my son about integrity I'm glad his mom did too
Hope is not dead.
he is a lovely young man 🥰
That Latino kid motivated me!!! Thanks Kid!!!
Wow congratulations kid you did a good job🙏🙏🙏
Sadly he's the exception, not the rule - SAD! SMH _ good for him though.
Only right way to do , god bless you bro
Kid was raised honorably.  Great job Mom. 😉
Good kid.
God bless him ❤️
what a good young man,  congrats
Nice
I believe in karma. Everything comes in circles. You do a good deed, you will be rewarded in some way. And yes, I FIRMLY believed in what he did. I want someone to give me back my belongings when I lose them in public, and I have lost many or forgot leaving stuff in public.  That's why I dont even think of stealing from another person's belongings if I find them in public. Just return them and the Big Guy upstairs keeps a record so when your  time comes, it will all work out in your favor.
He was tryna hit 💯
he deserved all the money
That’s lil Maru. Lil gay boy😂
What a good kid!
What a fantastic young man.
Kudos to him and his parents.
Damn. Them 2 ladies coulda invited him in and really thanked him
What hope is there for youth when future of all is doomed...giving up a "little" hundreds of times has left you empty of chances...sleep in the bed you made...
As they say, don’t judge by its cover ❤
👍🏽
I love seeing good stories like this❤
Well done sir.
that is great,  usually teenagers  find a purse with money and they take the money , props to this kid
Tattooed, Pierced, Backwards Cap and a Bling Chain yet a good kid. Never Judge a Book By It's Cover.
Don't know this young man but am proud of him and his mother. 👍🙏❤️
The legend has it he staid the night
🤜🤛... respect BRO!!!!
Please always be kind and feed a bear
is that central cee lol
He seen a milfs Id and did what any young man would have 😅😅
A good Samaritan mailed me back my wallet.. with no money or credit/debit cards in it lol 😆
lets be real he saw this cute girl on the driver's license and saw his chance.
Plot twist: there was 10k in the purse
A rod killing it.. Run for office please we know you’re honest
They should split the reward money 50/50 between the kid and his Mom to reward her for teaching him right from wrong
A young man did a good deed like they say if you do good good comes to you if you do wrong wrong comes back to you but in this case he did the right thing and look always rewarded awesome
woop!  woop!
Good White boy returned purse...others would have kept it.....blm
I remember when this was considered normal behavior and not something out of the ordinary. That was back before the demographic shift
Good for that young man and his mother. What a great mom!
The start of a porn hub video 😆
That's what happens when you have good parents that raise there kids with morals!. 🙏🏻
What a good young man! Good job bro
Bang bros
I followed all of my grand mother's lessons until recently when I heard from her she wanted me killed
Wow 👏🏻
you guys realize this is the normal thing to do right? aint' nothing special about this out here in south korea. Would've made the news if the bag was never found. Totally the opposite.
Way2go Adrian you're a stand-up man your mother raised you right and you listen and you understood thank you for being honest God bless you and please stay safe
Well done buddy. Not many of these round in this day and age.

God bless this young men’s soul his mom raised up the right way!
The news reporting good news????!!!!!! Awesome!! 🎉
What a great young man. 👏
I am a poor 74 year old woman, last night I was in a convenience store and a homeless man wanted cigarettes and I spent $9 buying him a pack, he never even thanked me.  This young man is an angel.
If only social media and the news echoed more positive things like this it would take   Off and spread quickly, rather then repeating murders where people know they can get famous
God bless this young man….there is hope in our young ones, i am happy!!!
What a good dude.. 👍🏻  I honestly don’t know if I could have been that honest 🤷🏽‍♂️
Good parents  Good kid Gonna be a good man too
beautiful
*All thanks to @dodertic who helped me get my money back from those scammers.  I really appreciate it sir.  I can't stop thanking you.*
1 for 2,000,000

It's all about the psrents
Das nice  but y’all ain’t got a sister for the homie? Lol he’s clearly an upstanding gentlemen 👍🏼
God bless him
My guy saw the ID she kinda bad
Ok, why is this viral news!  I’ve done that sort of thing several times on my lifetime!  No big deal!
Man, I need to find a purse and return it. I'm so broke it's unreal.
Who cares? Honestly who cares
awesome job young man and a huge thumbs up to his parents for making him a caring and great human
Great jon Mom & Dad..
He fine as hell, and respectful
What a great person his MOM raised him to do the right thing!  Thank you youngman.
That’s a good young man.  I’m glad he got rewarded, even though he wasn’t expecting anything.
There should be more Youngsters like this.
Great guy  !!   His Momma would be proud of him.
Notice no SKINNY JEANS were worn in this incident....definitely well raised 👏
Bet he has a mexican Mom!
good job by this young man :)
yes, raised correctly. turns out that must be the hardest job. congrats.
great folks all round,brill.
Good guy!! God bless him!!
Kid was raised right. And seeing a good deed being rewarded is amazing.
Need more great kid like him now a day.
Honesty is always the best policy,credit to his mom.
Always nice to see the good in the world.  Applaud this young man for his integrity!
San Andreas
He has a great future in whatever he does. Good job to him and his mom.
Awesome he’s a hero we definitely need more people like him
Not shocking at all. There’s always been good young people out there.
Yes had a similar experience to what you shared,  had a guy aged 17 turn up  and returned a large some of money that was in my purse fortunately it had my address in it. I was so thrilled I gave him a hug and cuddle ( My boob size is size H) which was nt had to pick up he enjoyed. So I gave him a spare bikini top. His eyes nearly fell out of their sockets.  His mother couldnt get over how thrilled he was to meet me. Then soon later she found the bikini top. She was both annoyed and angry. She came over with her husband and her son. We spoke for over an hour (She herself was large busted) and  we came to an understanding where he could stay with me over the weekends. With him occupying one bedroom with the door open and me across from his bedroom with the door open. Most of the time, if not all he joins me in my bedroom. I have a personal trainer that works with him personally and he has got so huge
What’s sad is so many closed minded fvcks would see this young man and assume he steals purses simply because of his appearance
Look at God
That purse woulda been gone gone
Lol he knew what he was doing ! He could have handed it to the store manager or the police Glad it paid off for him though
Thas right lil hommie my respect
Such a great young man!!! Thank you mom for raising such a caring and honest man 🙏💯👍🌻
If she was ugly he would’ve kept it hahahah I do t blame him for taking it back
ik he readung the comments rn giggling and kicking his feet
What a true true hero this person. Is going out the right way. Doing right thing. True true hero
It was probably his lil stepbrother and told the news just for them to come out on T.V.
Imagine what the world would be like if News outlets reported nothing but good news. Seems like these types of stories might make the last 30-40 seconds of news after they report all the evil in the world. We become what we absorb, lets absorb good stuff so we can become a better society. Fine work by this young man, wish everyone had the same character as this kid and his parents.
This kid was raised right!
It's a prank! Madam!
Two Christmases ago my wife and I were pulling into a “Big Mike’s Subs “ in Springfield MO.   I told her to stop the car it’s a wallet. We opened it and there was Hundreds of Dollars in it I quickly looked for an ID And we saw it was and older man’s wallet 70+   We went into the shop and he wasn’t in there. I was afraid to turn it over because of the amount of$$$$    So we decided to go to the address on his Military ID  I sent my wife to the door because I’m a big man and people say I’m inteminating  and I didn’t want to scare him  But I could see clearly from the car he was just amazed that we returned it my wife said everything is how we found it and Merry Christmas       Acts of good deeds happen every day and it’s great to see young people doing the right thing in this age of ME ME ME    I HOPE OUR YOUTH SEES THE PERSONAL REWARDS FOR DOING THE RIGHT THING
Great future for this kid
Good kid.. We need kids like him. Lol
Amen 🙏
That was so nice....
Good man
Thats a lie everyone them that been to California from pa stole from me and my kids
Measure of a Man.🤍
Mom taught him great values in life 🙌🙌♥️♥️
Good kid don't see that these days
My wallet got stolen three weeks ago. Dude spent every dollar in my bank account, every dollar on both my credit cards and threw everything else away. I would’ve paid the dude a few hundred bucks if he returned it, instead he got some dope new fraud charges to go with his orange jump suit.
Awesome job young man. ❤ Good to know there’s young ones out there with good hearted values😁
I believe integrity is one of the most important features a human can have. Doing the right thing when no one is watching pretty much sums up integrity.
Dia pasti dibesarkan oleh orang tua yang luar biasa.  Terima Kasih telah mengutamakan kejujuran. Dia juga tampan.   Semoga banyak kebahagiaan baik menyertainya.
So happy to see acts of kindness like this.
W kid
God bless him and you alll!! ❤❤
Wow! These days it’s extremely rare to see a good honest young man. May only good things come to him in life. I know his Mom is very proud of him.
🆙🆙🆙🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼👂🏼👂🏼👂🏼💕💕💕
I've recently found money twice and was able to return it to the rightful owners. For me it's most rewarding to see the look on the person's face when they get their money back. That's great the kid was rewarded but there is no financial compensation that can compare to the feeling you get seeing the rightful owner getting their money back. It just does something to your soul that a reward can't 💗💯
His mother raised him wright there is still a lot of good 👍 people in this world 🌎
That was good inside edition we love good news keep them coming 💖💖💖❤️

Good job Young Man! My Grandma is watching me from Heaven. I can't do anything but the right thing 😤😁
Esta timbre y timbre 🛎 y timbre 🛎 y timbre 🛎 habrán la Pinche puerta 😡
I once found a woman's purse on an off ramp in Cincinnati, like 20 credit cards and memberships and cash, i found a contact #, called her husband..he met me and treated me like a thief, not even a thank you...not everyone is thankful...
Why he kinda…
[“ my man!”]
Congrats to his parents 👍👍👍
So sweet!
Beautiful ❤
Bro the sagg is CRAZY
Lol. If that was me, I'd return the purse and everything inside because my parents raised me also to do the right thing!
Good story...Please share more good news!!
God bless him
Way to go kid,your going places
Amen! I'm so glad to see this.  Love every part,  from him returning it to getting the reward.  Deserves a million. God bless you, sir!
She cute i would’ve taken it back also
Amazing story. Thank you for sharing 🙏
👍👍👍👍👏👏👏👏
I remember doing this couple of years ago. I felt like it was the right thing to do.
That’s Wonderful!❤

This is beautiful, they should show stuff like this more, instead of just bad news.
But why saggy pants tho🤷🏻‍♂️
maybe another homeless fraud veteran sequel
Jokes on you guys, that's their nephew
The aunt rewarded him later xD
God's always watching
Why tf is she talking if it’s not her purse
Why he dress like he from the 90’s
Buenos simientos
Mystery of the stolen 👛.. Lmfao. Karma at his finest,  lady bugging! Lol. I'm jk
Haha lil homie seen the pic on the id and didn’t hesitate lol
What privilege. Its expected of white people to do this type of thing and we never get recognized.
Plot twist: its her friend.
This is why I love Cali so much because of this so kind good job bro
a legend in the building
That is a Karma bonus tight there. I lost my wallet at a concert once. I had my cards in there and all my cash ID everything. I got a ride there because I was drinking. I had nothing. Someone took the wallet to my bank after they looked at debit card. I could not believe it in the morning when the bank called me. I guess I dropped it getting out the Uber and found it. I could not believe it still had the $60 cash too.
😂❤❤
3k for a bag is crazy

Human society has experienced low expectations when it comes to honesty. But this isn’t a story about honesty. It’s about voluntarily taking responsibility to set things right, about opportunity to be of service to correct another’s misfortunate circumstance.
So not 1 person thinks he stole it waited some time and returned it?
He’s fine
Seems like a scam!
I found a purse with over 300. and cards. I found a number an drove half way to meet her. When I brought it over to her car, she grabbed it  and took off. Never even thanked me!
i want him
We need more people like this boy.......I wish i could be a hero like this
Good young man
good kid
Never judge a book by its cover and never judge people the way they look
Everyone who find this “shocking” wouldn’t return the purse.
This world need's more people like this good guy, God bless you. ❤️
..idol!☝❤✌👍💪😁🇵🇭
That happened here in san Diego California 😚🫡
Every normal human being would do this
💜🥺💜💜💜🥺🥺🥺🥺
I found a wallet one time it didn't even get a thank you had a lot of money in it too
Bless this young man!  <3
This is true sigma😎
Massive W for the mom who raised him.
Well done bud...well done
W kid 🔥🔥🔥
i remember when i was 6, we were raking leaves and i found a wallet, so we let it dry inside and my dad found the address and we returned it to her, then he gave me $100 and it made me very happy
why does the teen look like he's from some 90s nu metal band
This is what don't judge a person by their cover means, this guy may look like a thug but his heart and mind is in the right place momma raised him well.
He looks like an Average Swag Gangster I saw from the streets, and I didn't know this guy has a heart of gold, he did brilliant idea from that one
Nice one my friend.
skin matters
Bless him!
What a great young man ❤
Plot twist : that’s either her son or daughter bf
everyone says the same thing “everyone be more like this guy” but nobody wants to become like this guy on their own lol
Thank You 💜🙏🏽💜
When i was 10 years old, there was a neighborhood kid who would steal my bike and then return it to my parents for a reward. He did it several times before they caught on to his scam.
she didnt even give him money at first lmaooo. he wouldnt have gotten anything if it wasnt for the womes friend lol 🤣🤣🤣
Reward in bed 😹
IMAGINE LIVING IN A WORLD WHERE SUCH A THING MAKES THE NEWS
All credit goes to his parents......
what a boss!
whats his insta
He saw the license and said "MILF!!"
God bless the kind honest gentleman who helped the beautiful lady get back her belongings may God lord Jesus bless you and your family with happiness in Jesus name amen 🙏 ❤
good on him, raised right.
JESUS  is coming soon and JESUS is the only way to salvation accept JESUS as your LORD and SAVIOR today!!
Don't take the v@ccine trust in the LORD ALMIGHTY.!
Damn I need to move to San Diego 😍😍
I wish I could like this however many times it takes for YouTube to pay this man for his honesty
God bless you Good young man.
This is a good example of don't judge a book by its cover, a lot of people would take him as a bad person by the way he dresses
This goes to show that people musn't judge emmidiately by the looks, unfortunately in my country although not all but majority of people seeing a person with tattoos and that kind of get up assumes that his either an addict or an ex convict.
0:10 the smile 😂
I am happy for everybody and God bless this young man and his mother who raised him right.
Good parenting. Simple as that
the sad thing is if he had gotten pulled over with the purse he probably would have gotten arrested for stolen property or somthing, cops suck..
👍
I am Aboriginal and i did this when i found a purse on a bench in Vic Park, because i know folks who lost their i,d's n picture's felt sad and so i looked for any address in it and walked all the way out my way to return the purse and all it's belongings. But all they did was blame me only, for taking it for a reward and threatened to call the cops on me if i didn't leave their yard. From Regina, Saskatchewan. Citizens need more heart in this City. Peace Be with us all
Always trust an Adrian 😁
He so fine🧎🏾‍♀️
Amazing how people turn out who have parents that care.
He has No Tiktok Account, Tiktok is Bad Influence!.
Why do people find it so hard to believe actual good people exist? “He did it for the money” how would you know that?
Plot twist: The purse only had 1000 dollars
yeah I'm truly agree that if you raised your child teaching what is right to do then he will always remember you as a parent.
God bless him.
This guy might look like he's about to say, "Yo girl, wassup, wanna spank?" but he's got a good heart otherwise.
King
Dude got instant karma made 22 k off it aswell 🎉🎉🎉
W rizz
we need more ppl lik him, buh dang he fyne 😍.😭😭
Very rare in america
W man
Good man
what a good kid
Absolute gigachad right there
my boy def took a peak to see if it was worth it or not 😭😭
great kid, good parenting
mission accomplished
i salute.  What a King!
nah he tried to smash
He probably spent it all on vapes
I would steal the money
glad to see this popping in my recommended again
Hes in boys
I walked into the chemist and there was $350 at my feet, I go to pick it up and some man gets it before me and hands it to me thinking that it was mine. I take it to the counter and let them know that someone had dropped there money. I was rewarded with a little gift bag with some tooth paste etc.. Looking back I think the store managers probably just pocketed the money rather than finding who lost it
Champion man and fam
Wow,his momma would be proud 👏
Idk this one so rare in europe 🤣😂
Plot Twist: he is a local drug dealer.
Some random girl say: eh, he is not tall enough then chose a violent guy.
I remember when I gave a lady her purse back that she left on the roof of her car. She just looked at me weird and went “oh ok” and closed the door, not even a thank you. I should’ve took the cash…
Thank you buddy.
Ah yes, a good deed that should be standard becomes the next senzation and gets rewarded with a month worth of salary. Such a world we live in...
He defs smashed
ارجل الطيب
❤that's amazing. thanks for sharing. ❤
Im surprised he wasnt shot
He deserve it!
Good lad.
Great respect to this young man ....
He was raised right
Not all super heroes wear a cape. <3
but when i returned a german woman’s lost purse i found on the subway she started befriending and stalking me and my friend at our apartment and even went as much to come to my place of work and harass me while i tried taking peoples orders and when i told her to leave me alone she flipped out and had to be taken away. and later on she kidnapped me and stuck me behind a hidden room in her house and my friend from earlier had to find another purse on the subway to find the woman and had to drug her to get me out
What a man. 17 and smarter than 90% of human males. Good job bro
That's my son right there 🐐🐐
There may still be hope for this world yet! Good job kid! Keep it up you will go far in life.
Ese is probably 18 now. He should try revisiting their house for Netflix
Now thats is a Sigma..
In a country like the US, suprised he didn't get shot for his troubles
You're mum taught you well.Hip hip hooray for you.xx🌟👍
Yo he only returned that bag in the hope he'll have a chance with Miss Fine Ass Eliana Martin and I completely understand and respect that.
heroic
Imagen he just stole the Bag and returned it later. Now he gets 3k for it. XDD I dont want to say that it is like that, its just in my head. XDDD
What he did was right. His mom is 100% correct. Do good even when no one is watching. I don't understand the GoFundMe culture. I thought it was only for life and death matters.
“Always do the right thing even when nobody is watching” that boy is Marine material 🙌🏻
RESPECT! 🙏🙏🙏
Definitely wanted to smash
I did the same guy once ✌️❤️
So kind
I need his ig
I saw white CJ i clicked
Man up stairs is watching
we don need more people like him we need to change like him
His Mamma raised him right!
You won't see stories like that on mainstream media. Only hate and fear there.
Kindness is free
IRS will find this young lad and he will pay LOL
Imagine he just wanted to meet the girl because he thought her picture in the license was cute 😂
Good work young man.Salutes!
The woman: "OMG! thank you very much. 🥰" The teen: "don't litter."
top g
Smart man, he can get later some really sweet pussy. 💪🏽❤️
He finee
i love seeing videos like this. thank you for sharing something positive
Didnt get the kid for an interview for this? Thats strange
Not all heroes wear capes.
He is so fine
Perfect example of don’t judge a book by the cover.
bro doing GTA V random encounters irl
Our society was such this was the norm years and years ago… Kudos to this young man for his good deed… Kudos to his parents for raising him right… BUT it’s a sad commentary we no longer expect this type of gesture from everyone… This kind act has now become an exception rather than the rule…
An then he spent the 3K on drugs.
An then he spent the 3K on arms for a robbery.
I remember when I gave a 100 euro bill that fell from a mans pocket back to him. No thanks and a gaze blaming me as if I stole his money
Amazing dude
Excellent young man who's honest and was raised very well!!! May God bless him always and give him the very best that life has to offer!!! He's a perfect example of what a decent and kind and caring person should be!!!
العراقيين جان سوهه ابلاش
1. You dont lose anything if you return someones property. You gain REAL respect, that is something you cant buy. 2. If you steal, you know it rest of your life, even you want to lie about it.. It is still there, and you know it. Its all about how much you respect yourself. If you dont have respect towards yourself, you dont respect others either. You can see this happening with inmates.. If you dont have nothing to lose, after that nothing has any value. Hats off for this youngster, keep that mentality and you be something rare and precious.
What a beautiful young man. He deserves that reward ❤️
He’s honestly.
We need more teens like this instead of vaping hopeless idiots. I'm a teen btw.
God bless that young man.
Sigma male moment.
I bet if she was ugly that purse would have been in the trash... driver's license saved her lol
Thank God his mom did not aborted him.
W to everyone
Put good intentions on good action and you will receive good  rewards!!
what’s his @ frfrrr 🤭.
If only there were more people like this guy in the world
gta 5 story mode random events be like
Good job!!! More of this kind news pls 😍❤️😍❤️😍❤️😍
17-Year-Old Returns Woman’s Lost Purse and Gets $3K Reward me: cant believe they got away with that also me: tf its legit
That handbag looks exactly like the one from the movie Greta.
HE DEFINITELY GOT HER NUMBER NOW
Orale homes, that’s how vatos need to ride ese. That’s how you become a firmeass vato ese, keep it firme homes  *cholo stance*😎
Same thing I did!! I found it at a shopping cart and I brought it to the lady’s house it had a decent amount of cash in her purse because I had to open her wallet for her I.d and you can see a thick amount of cash. I didn’t count or anything, just I.d and took it to the lady’s house.
Cant believe this from from western young
Why is the woman on the left even in this video? She has nothing to do with anything. She helped raise some money. Neat. Stop talking so much and allow the woman who’s purse was found to get a word in.
Central Cee?🤯
That is nice, I was rob at gun point and they took my purse , I had my documents, money, cell; they took evreything I had  in my purse. (4teens) they  use my cell and  I mesege them at list give me back  my documents just put them in the mail box, you Can keep the money but I never got my documents.
How awesome! If only all the young men behave in this manner, the world would be so different.
What? Where I live, it is perfectly normal to return something to another person...
Did they let him hit tho??? that’s the real question
Love that he breaks all external stereotypes pertaining to attire, age, and general appearance. That a young man, could exercise the morality of his heart, and destroy all misconception about the generations to come! And looking cool while he does it!
Let him smash😭
Family Values 👍
❤️
Kid wanted that # after seeing who was on the I.D 😂
Still some hope for the younger generation
Is that central cee
when i do this nothing happens
Perfect example of not judging a book by its cover
So in all the fight about what is a man and toxic masculinity- that’s my man right there, standing up and doing the right thing nothing more manly than that
Ok but he’s so cute though.
He gets his lesson from his families. Every parents should teach their child this kind of morality. Lesson learned from the family is the best lesson 🙏
Wow such a sweet story
Common Adrien W
His parents raised him well. Love hearing stories like this.
Man he is fine
Thats nice
I’d do that shi too you never know you might get sum head from a Baddie
Very fine young man. Deserve to live in this world.
Moral of the story: steal a purse; return it the next day, free $3k!
This is a historic moment for the Mexican community. The first ever recorded return of stolen property. 1m comments giving kudos. LMAO.
Now that’s what I call news
lol. Maybe he stole it, to then give it back to her. Smart way of getting inside a woman. So to say, ever think like that? Oh, what a shame.
The fact that this is news in America is crazy, really goes to show how far behind everyone else America is
thats a normal thing to do in islam why u so shocked of doing the right thing, u really lost america or whatever this country is 😂
I am happy for the kid bt the fact we need this to be recognized is so disturbing
It’s calling Karma
Bro that kid so lucky now he has a good rep and an extra 19k to his name
western society and they banged😂
I remember finding a handbag on a train once, and I looked inside for an I.D and than searched the person up on Facebook and sent them a message, and she collected the bag the next day from my job. I was happy I was the one who found her bag cause she had quite a lot of money in it. She was super happy and relieved.
thats great, dunno how dumb you gotta be to leave your purse in the shopping cart you were pushing around but thats a good dude
Prob a simp
If he was a year older they would of rewarded him another way.
Teenager: "My mom told me since I was little to always do the right thing even when no one's watching." You heard that Milwaukee, Chicago, Houston, Atlanta, Cleveland, Bronx, Oakland, Sherman Oaks, San Francisco, LA, Las Vegas, Detroit.  Let this 17-year-old kid be an example of what to be, and not be a low life punk living a criminal life.
lets not forget what his moms said
imagine he stole it, to return it and maybe get a reward lmao
Plot twist: He was going to steal the money, then saw her license picture😂. But in all seriousness, mad props to this guy.
looks like such a nice kid 😊
Faith in Humanity restored.
You have a good heart .Bless your heart ❤
Karma will get you if you don't do the right thing trust me when I tell you that folks
I’m Australia I get my wallet back for free all the time
a real gangsta🙏
Only 1% people would do that
this shouldn't be news, this is how humans should be❤️❤️
Meanwhile in my country, there's a case where You found purse and give it back. The receiver sued you of stealing and even report it to police. Then even worse you're deemed guilty and Jailed
Maybe there was no money in there 🤷🏽‍♂️
there's no hop for the younger generation 🤣
Damn why can’t anyone drop purses in parking lots I’m in
I pray whoever is reading this has a blessed day. God loves you. ❤
I wish all humans were like this guy.
ngl the go fund me title hella creepy
👍
Wow some of the world isn't retarded.
This is amazing ❤
Respect. ✊🏻  He did the right thing by returning the purse back to this woman. There aren’t many young people who would do the same. It can be seen that he is very kind, thanks to his great parents.😃☺️👍🏻😇
theres hope
Plot twist: bro saw the license photo and he just chasing tail
there’s hope 😭
What’s so sensational about this is the incongruity between how the boy’s dressed, and thus how we expect him to behave, and how he actually does. To sensationalize this story on Inside Edition tells me that their producers have some serious biases about the way this kid is dressed. That’s obnoxious.
I love this. Karma ❤️
Wow just found a 10g bag let’s return it.
This is fantastic. Props to his mother for that good advice. We need more videos and news like this instead of all doom and gloom!!!!!
Congratulations 🍾 for doing the right thing🎉
He saw an id and he was like, she’s a milf maybe she would let me hit
Wowen: there’s hope for our younger generations  Me:💀
19 grand for doing the right thing.  That's great I'm sure he'll put it to good use.  mom raised a good young man.
*Everyone liked that.*
There's hope...
We need more news like this in this mad mad world
Rare to happen ❤
I once found a drivers license and got a ch9colate merci
Sorry I may miss the point but isnt it normal to return a thing to a person the item belongs to or take it to a police station ? I couldnt see anything special about it. If I were the man, I wouldn’t even accept the reward. I’m from Japan and this can be due to a cultural difference.
at last he gets 3K...some people don`t reward finders at all...
Well done young man
It feels so weird how surprised everyone is like "Damn, didn't expect a dude like him to do that" 💀
He probably stole it then fell guilty and gave it back...pocketing 10% of the cash in the wallet so he doesn't feel too bad + 3k reward on top...this kid is a genius
Christian Latin kid returns a Latin lady's purse! Should happen 9 times out of 10.
All that dontaion the bich womam stole it
Good on ya mate!
Love this
please every kid be like him, morals will save us
Keep rewarding normal behaviour. Well done, idiots.
Wonderful❤
❤
Should have rewarded him with a threesome ladies, lol.
How is doing a good deed onn the news It should be normal Is it cuz the reward?
My name is Adrian it could’ve been me
He hella fine too
Whoever raised him, raised him to grow full of respect and consideration for other people. This is so important for others to see ❤
His parents should be very proud
It’s all about parenting, either you raise them or the government/smartphone will
he probably wanted to take that girl out after seeing her license lol
What a honest young man! Like really thats so good of him!
What a Mastermind. All planned from the beginning
Bro gets 3k dollars for being a decent human being 😭
They just stole my purse LMAOO
Just live in Europe, its normal here for People to not steal☠️☠️☠️
Seems like a normal GTA 5 situation
he return the purse because he wanted to meet the beautiful lady maybe
I once found a purse on the side of the road. I called up the people that it belonged to and arranged a time for them to collect it as their address wasn't to be found on the purse for me to go to their house to return it.  Well when they came around they were recording on their phone, they took one look at the purse and accused me of stealing $50 from the purse despite me never even taking note of any money in the purse and only looking through it to find a phone number to call to return it to. They then threatened to call the police on me to get me to pay up despite me never taking any money from the purse.  Was a really great experience
Why does the young man dress the way he does only to act the the way he does, it don't make no sense.
Righteousness beats happiness  because righteousness will always impact the world in a positive way, while happiness doesn't.  Some kids would have been happy to keep the purse for themselves, but just because it would have made them happy, it doesn't mean it's right.  Doing the right thing doesn't always feel good.  God Bless You All and Amen!!!!
Women☕: Is there any other I can pay for this..☺ Boi: Mam we can work on that🌚
a spark of hope in a miserable dark world
WHAT ???????  $19,000   Thats fantastic , good luck to him .
Way back in 1980 I was in the Royal Navy. One evening my ship went into Torquay and I went ashore for a few drinks with my shipmates. While they went to the first pub, I took the opportunity to go to a phone booth and speak to my brother; then I joined my mates in the pub. The next round of drinks were my turn but I realised I'd left my wallet on the shelf in the phone booth so rushed back ... but it wasn't there of course. I borrowed money from one of the other guys to pay for my round and we continued our run ashore. At the end of the evening we went back onboard and as I came across the gangway, the bosuns mate handed me my wallet. He told me "Some civvy found it and saw the Navy ID card inside and brought it to the ship". All of the contents (money, cards, photographs etc.) were there and the person who returned it didn't even leave their name for me to thank them. All these years later I still remember that act of kindness and sincerely hope there is such a thing as Karma because they deserve very good things in their life.
did he smash tho?
bro is on grove street
I once returned a wallet with a ton of cash, credit cards, and information. Only thing I got was a simple "thank you" LOL
It's sad that this is considered rare.
The longest 2 minutes of my life 💀
I hope the boy clapped cheeks, what a guy
It would have been only a ‘thank you’ if they were chinese 😂😂😂😂
♡♡♡♡♡
Good on you A Rod
Honor and Integrity is rare
Beautiful story of this young man!  God Bless you!
how did he get his money? They found him?
and me returning bags to other people i get nothing?
I think if we see more stories like this on the news more often, instead of politics and police drama, it would have a more positive impact on our society.
❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
well done young man
Good on yea lil bro
I just lost my walet last weekend at qt and a man brought my wallet back but my $180 was gone glad i got my ss and id back but shi down 180
Lmao da Botox looks so funny just be yourself 😂
3k is elon musk pocket money lol
He’s adorable xx
That's great, but a news story? Isn't it normal to do this?
Good guy and raised right by mama.
I’m 17 too  Good to see my generation being kind
being rewarded for being human tf
We need more people like him ❤️❤️
Lol there was probably nothing valuable in the purse, so of course he returned it in hope of something.
WEST SIDE
I think he’s solid and meant to do right, but if I had to guess the reason he did that I’d guess it had something to do with the dime piece of an aunty on that ID card
wow, I and my friends found an id card and tried calling the police, it was too much for us, so we took the card and got on the bus. My friend that had the card in his pocket told me to give it to my mom since she worked for the police. So I took the card and waited for my stop. I then got off and went to my apartment, at home I gave the id to my mom and told her what had happened. She then found the person in less than an hour and we could give it to her. She was grateful, she gave me 15 euros to share with my friends so we could buy candy. It felt really good.
He’s  a great kid
It's sad to see people surprised by seeing a teenager helping,this world is really messed up. Good job to the boy for doing the right thing :)
Plot twist he couldn’t deal with the guilt 😂😂😂😂
Theres stil no hope lol, ofc theres good people but theres still bad
What a boss, we need more young people like him and for more good deeds to go rewarded.
good lad
i thought thats naturally
w edgar
Unspoken rizz 🤔
never judge a book by its cover
0:40 20 bucks joke was good
DAMNN HE IS FINE
Respect for this young man ❤️
Aww
slump6s??
Can we all agree he looks like Faze Rug?
Sad that we live in a world where this is "special"...this should be normal ^^ But good job dude!
Respect + Mission Completed
Bro lives in los santos 💀💀 nobody gives money like that, only in gta
Nice 😊
I've done that and most of the times didn't even get a thanks
Wow this isn’t common
What is normal for us will be a news report for you. I'm really sorry you Americans that you have to live in such a broken country
Good man! Rare for those with a darker complexion.
This warms my heart
Heartwarming stuff from both sides.I am returning back to krypto now-Superman
i want to see more of this type of reporting
ok cool but 20 million views? its not rly important i dont get why theres a whole report on it
We all know he returned it because its a woman's purse. If he found a wallet, the story is different.
If i hadnt read the description,i would have mistaken for this young man a robber or intruder only by seeing the video
if u do a good things to others good thing eventually will come back to you again
Not many people who look Like that give the purse back
What a good parents, gor raising such a good child, not like these days, parents raise children with electronic
Respect for that kid what a good young man
👏👏👏👏👏👏
she should let him hit when he 18 just sayin
Good on that young man, and that money can be a great start for someone his age.
That’s a burkin bag seshhh
nah i know bro was in it for the bag.  kudos to him 🤣🤣🤣
Have either of these got an onlyfans
he’s so cute fr that’s so sweet
Gets paid in  more money then there is in the wallet
Imagine how much reward he lost inside the wallet
Huge W for the kid.. ✨
Great job for bringing it back 👏 👍
Still humanity in this world🥹. He was raised right💯.
It’s sad that this used to be a regular thing that didn’t go on the news.
this is amazing, but the problem is that rewarding this much money teaches kids that when they do good deeds they will get rewarded and the kids wont do it for the right reason.
Adrian?? W bro
he was tryna hit
come no body care... i return phone all the time ...
🤍🤍
Good deeds.
He wanted the aunts number
botox??
im so proud that homie ❤ what a good man bro, god will get you back
He’s so fine
he fine
Omggggg bless his heart 😢
There's hope for the human race after all 💯
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
There is a lot of good people the media won't let you see the good only the Bad
Nahh
I wish if I return something they would reward me like he did
W kiddd
Believe or not I just did that the other day!they try giving me $ but I said NO
This is exactly why I always bring things back to the owner when I find it. I’ve had lots of people reward me very generously👌🏽
Love this story!
homie did that to see her cmon now
Homie liked what he saw lol
i think he saw how bad she was... an decided to drop off... i would too shii😍👅😂💀
Win for MOM 💕
Who ever raised him good job
W FOR THATT
This man is a top G
That's right
I wish my fiancé was treated this way. He found a wallet outside a Walmart and returned it to the owner however instead of being appreciated for what he did the Bethlehem police dept put his picture all over social media calling him a thief. After hours of calling the police station and explaining the wallet was returned, it still took a couple days for a retraction yet never received an apology.
This kid deserves the world.
I love it
I want to cry. This is the kind of humanity that we need and people like him to lead.
Okay can we talk abt why he looks kindaaa…….🫣
I love this
This shouldn't even make the news but nice that it does
Yessss my son dresses in a way he gets mistaken for a hoodlum walking around or even just sitting in his car in my neighborhood but he would happily return anyone's stuff even if it had plenty of money. I raised him with morals and good ethics. 👌
W son for his parents teaching him right!!!
he slays
That boy prolly bought so much pot and alcohol that’s what I would’ve done 😂
EVERY1 COULD TAKE A PAGE FRM THIS (KID'S) BOOK. IT'S A SHAME THERE'S NO DECENT TEENAGER'S ANYMORE  GOD BLESS 🕊️🇱🇷 ADRIAN RDZ❤️🌹
That is awesome ❤
Dam he fine😍
im 27 years old and damn can you imagine how fine melina was when she was my age XD
Woooow😍👏🏻👏🏻
He did the bare minimum and got 3k
What a nice young man. Well done mum!
Good job mom and dad you raise a fine boy❤
Sadly kids like this will get profiled for the way he looks , not knowing he’s good kid
This makes my life all worth it😊
Great job Adrian!💪👍
Good job!!+
If everyone was raised like him, imagine what a great society to live in ?
Lovely young man
I wish the whole world was like this
bro has drip
Absolutely beautiful😢
We know he saw her license and said let me pull up
The real hero here is the mother of the dude, alot of troublemakers usually come from cause of a bad household and parenting. He had a sense of morality and made the right decision without expecting a reward in return
wow! he did great!!!!!!!!!! he should be rewarded😁😁😁
Respect brother ❤️🤌
I made him return it
He was raised the right way! Fantastic job to his parents for raising such an amazing kind teenager!
he is so fine
The boy is good and fine or say  good looking😁
We do have people in this world that’s nice 😊
He is 100% right the same thing happened to me.  I found an expensive purse with wallet, passports, bank cards, and other things at the airport.  I searched for the list and found at airport police station but reviews were horrible.  I found the owner on Instagram and Facebook and after 4 hours of waiting she call me back we met at a wholesfood and I returned everything back to her.  My parents raised me well to do the right thing.  God blesses me more for being honest and the owner also gave me a reward.
What a great human being. I hope he is given anything he needs
Good kid! Great job mama ❤️
Dang makes me wish I returned about $300 I found at the bank. Lol. Oh well.
❤
He so fit
God bless and yess there is hope!🙏🏾
Respect!!
Wow
Down ass foo
Shiii He was probably trying see the girl on the ID like shiii ima probably get me sum sum for bringing this back this person fine 🫣🫣😆😆😆🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈

Good job young man!!!! Your mothers a good woman.
The speaker needs to have her thyroid checked
Hes cute😍
Good guy

that's how I met your mom
he's mad fine 🤷🏻
What a great yong man he is. We definitely need more honest, courageous, gentleman/wemon like himself. That makes my day. God bless him!!!
w
I immediately knew by looking at him that he was raised by a good mother, salute and massive respect to him. He deserves the praise
Great kid
You know that fooo getting hella wax and weed with that money lmfao
Everybody saying his mom or dad rasied him right just give HIM credit because alot of parents take credit where it isnt due.
i mean i would do the same
I did this three times.  Where is my 3k lol. Jk.  Good young man there
Other people In the would who have also returned things to their onwer - here you go I am returning this.   Owner - thank you.    ☹️
sweet boy! i’m glad he was rewarded !
This is a King
I got kicked out a month before I turned 18. Got my last check from a job I was working at shortly after. I went to the store with a buddy one night and was going to get some food for myself. I got in the store and my wallet was gone. I went outside and looked through the whole parking lot and couldn't find it. (Black wallet in a dark black parking lot, and there was snow everywhere.) Two days later I got a message on Facebook saying the found my wallet and left it at the stores customer service. Of course all my money was gone. 🙃
🔥🫶🏻
is he the rizzler😂😂😂
U know what guys I lost my phone then I calling someone attend my cal sir actually I miss my phone he told don't worry come bus stand & get ur mobile I believe him but he switched  off 😒 but this young boy gud&  sweet heart person
He wants a milf 😂😂😂
It would be good to know that this was more common than not.  But sadly, it probably is not.  I've lost items on which my name and address (and in some cases my phone number) were clearly displayed.  But, then never to be seen again.  And, have also had things stolen. I like to think that people have common decency, but I'm often disappointed.
God bless them 3 man this is what happens when you do good things this is amazing you get rewarded ❤
The IRS coming in to collect Taxes off this 17 year old
My mom left her purse in a public restroom and it was returned to the police station. I left my purse on a college campus same thing it was returned. People do return things you just don’t hear about it. As for the young man he was rewarded tenfold good for him and I want to say kudos to the women who rewarded him too.
Rodriguez 🌹☘️🇲🇽
Bright green color and still???? 🤨
What a g💥
We need more people like him. Now this is a good news story worth hearing.
Feeling sorry in your society. Here in North East India Mizoram, we return things
yes he was
Plot twist Actually he was about to take the money that was inside the purse...  But unfortunately the purse was empty so he had to return lol
God rewarded him..for his honesty
Thats so lovely:)
Amazing ❤️
My son found a wallet on the ground when he was like 5. I found the owner in the phone book by his drivers license. The guy was so happy he gave him $10, my boy didn't understand it. I knew then I'd done good in my teaching......
He was looking to get some after seeing the ID
0:41 She lowkey hit that
When I was a teenager me and my friends got this lady pocketbook back that somebody snatched from her in Brooklyn,,, When we brought it back to her the cops was there and we got arrested so we didn't get a reward we got put in jail???.. But throughout my life I found people's Social Security checks income tax checks and return it to them.. I just love to see people happy whether I know them or not.
I love how this kid looks straight out of 1998.
My girlfriend was super pist when I we found a purse in a shopping cart at Walmart in the parking lot. It was fat. Had a fat wallet with lots of credit cards n money. I turned it over to the Walmart front service and my girlfriend was really pist I did that…. I don’t regret it
that’s why i do this in gta every time
He prob got some milf boooty too.
Such a fine young man. Kuddos to parents!
What a good buy Adrian….. cuz this Adrian could never
Praise the Lord for people like him.  May  God be with him always!

He's fine

Everyone gangsta till a good young man who look like a gangsta returns a purse
Those ladies😂
LOL , in west and US , situations like these seems so rare to happen and also make them famous XDDDD , no safe at all.
He deserved it. not all people do that
THE BOY THAT RETUTN THR PURSE IS SO CUTE
He answered,"there wasn't money in it."
I'd bring it back for her too.
We know that the world is messed up when doing the right thing raises eyebrows. Let that sink in for a moment. Mad respect to this fine young man.
That was sweet
Not assuming anything here, just saying that when we were young we would buy stolen bags from other teens for 5 bucks, just to return them a day after got stolen telling them random stories where we found them, 9/10 times we got at least 20 bucks.
only returned it cause the lady was fine 😂😂
Ok I'm going to a parking lot brb
He knew she was fine asl from the id prolly
🧢
Pays to be good, eventually.
A good did will result in good end
That’s lil maru nah jsp
They sound Brazilian. Good job, ladies..
and he hot too like hes a goddess
Plot twist he the one that stole it and returned it for money
funny thing is he absoluely looks like a criminal
That isn't the guy who was rude to Simon cowell on AGT..
yooo if i would do it here where i live i would not even get a friendly handshake....
Feels good man
i love great news on the internet and this is one :D
there is still good in this generation
This is so cap 0:07
then he paid her 3k for sex lol
Thank the mom for her great job. Good job ya'll
Wow and this is a young man who would be labeled a “thug” by most people. Ganstas have hearts to
Wow amazing!!! 🎉❤ I want to hear this kind of story more and more!!
Encouraging to see a fine young man. So rare these days.
He fake
Someone raised him right, total headache losing a wallet
😭❤️❤️❤️
What a wonderful man
Good job boy  honesty is there in family 👍👍
Great kid. And great to reward kindness✌️😎
Hell yeah 👍 good job Bro
It's my man...👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
After stealing it and realizing their wasn’t anything good to steal
personally i would’ve given him something other than money 😭
I love that his kindness came back around, and that these ladies insisted on repaying his honesty with such high rewards. And all the people who pitched in to reward him.
oh he fineee to😩
When you do good, you will get good things in your life. Karma!!
Aw wholesome
Teen: *hold door* Old people: “This generation is saved after all!! GOD BLESS YOU SIR”
its not hard bro prolly had nun to do found the bag and is a normal person so thought of returning it
Why does she loook like that lmao
Great guy
Naki
AND HE'S FINE.
That boy was raised right 🫶🏻
when he’s fine and a good person😍‼️
He did the right thing .. sometimes it’s hard too do the right thing and receive some Haribo gummy bears as a reward
he fine
POV: he stole it just to give it back
He’s hella cute
so like no one is gonna say his @ 😭
Awesome
God lord he is so fine
He is a good teenager compared to other ones nowadays
Weq
How kind of this young man there aren’t too many people like him.    Compliments to his parents including his mother as well for raising him the way a parent is supposed too.
People believe anything they see.
He was so nice to the old lady too he’s like “yes I found it in the parking lot” ❤
he is fine💯
making us san diegens proud
Beautiful young man indeed
WELL DESERVED
Raised right . Good for you buddy !!!
mom raised me this exact way. christianity helped us as well. i just love the feeling of knowing i just made someone’s day after a hard time they could’ve been having. sad to see that some people would’ve probably stole the purse instead. some people just weren’t raised right.
A good man right their! ✊✊✊
he’s fine as hell
💯
YEAHHAHASSSSS
Love It!
Should of let him hit
he cute too and he has manners, more men like this !!
This is exactly the kind of news I wanna' see more of...
A human being in rare form
Very cool! Heartwarming video!
It's insane to me how something like this gets on the news? I did this so many times. It's basic human decency...
I’m 17 and I would never do this
*There's hope for the younger generation" *Kid dies next day*
Great heart & Sweet !! Glad you got your purse!
What a wonderful story . I hope that money helps him with his future .
They wish he was 18
This guy is a product of good parenting. Kudos to him and his parents.
How many people she slept with wemon always hide that
Only if all teenagers and people in general where this amazing. Like this young man
jesse we need to do good deeds
this made me smile
Great guy... kudos to his mom!
The kindness here on earth outweighs all the darkness.
That’s awesome, his morals, values kicked in.  Great person.
Say no to racism
wow this is actually a really nice story. props to youtube for recommending this gem
It honestly is a good feeling doing something like this. I've seen people drop money a few times and stopped them, once I had a gas station cashier accidentally give me and extra $50 in change and just a few weeks ago I found someone's cellphone in the parking lot of the gas station near me and it wasn't even locked so I called the last number that had called it and it was the person who lost the phone using someone else's hoping that somebody had found it. Makes me happier knowing someone's day wasn't ruined or worse than keeping something that wasn't mine would.
I did this good deed long time ago , a construction worker my neighbor lost 1k money salary for that Day i return it the next day when i heard someone lost money
That's touching
Dont believe the hype 😜.
Melina looks like a woman I dated 💦
W Rizz
I found a Louis Vitton purse and contacted the owner through Facebook, instead of being grateful she accused me of stealing it out of her car and called the police on me. (I found it in the middle of the street on a new construction project I was working on) So instead of returning it to her like I was attempting to do I threw it back on the street and told the officers I returned it to where I found it because I wasn’t happy about being accused of stealing. They weren’t too thrilled but there was nothing they could do or say, I tried to do the right thing and she wouldn’t allow it.
Woulda got what 100-400 out of that purse? But god showed him a crossroads and do to nothing else other than this man’s own decision to show love he was blessed🫶🏽
He is very kind
Judging him by his outfit you wouldnt assume such a good deed from him
J.I. Prince of NY
Sean Diaz from Life is Strange 2 thugged out tho
This is amazing and wonderful, good kid and good parenting! This young man deserves his reward
Fake
Truth to be told most people would have judged him with that look but I’m proud he proved that wrong
Someone did this to me i lost my wallet at the mall and i got back and some stranger ask for my name and everything and just gave my wallet to me. Gave him 200$ that day.
…but did he smash?
Anybody else think it’s all the woman has somebody else’s id in her purse
What a wonderful young man, the reward is richly deserved.
Someone pls fine his @
Honesty is the best policy, I am proud of this young man, doing the right thing shows solid character .
woah, actually it ended up raising almost $177,000 good job so far, guys!!!
"...even when nobody is watching." What an outstanding young man. May his future shine as bright as his good heart. Great job to his Mama who raised a real winner!
Gods watching. Or did you guys forget about him? Most people do
Honour your Mother and Father and it will be well with you and you will live long on the earth. This young man honoured his Mother's instructions to always do good even if someone isn't watching. God was watching He put it in the heart of these people to let others know and reward him. I know many people who have returned purses and wallets and got nothing in return and didn't expect to but this man did because he honoured his Mother's instructions in life.
When i was his age i was 18
From my experience no good deed goes   unpunished . This is the first so made the fake news
The way he was carrying the purse. ☺️
He looks like the kind of punk to do the exact opposite, proud of him for proving me wrong.
good for him. i would never do that ☺️
The jet Rodriguez strikes again
Is being kind and honest rare in america?
I’d wanna party w those women
He wanted to meet her! Lol
Awh this gives me hope
His college paid ! Iktr
More then likely no money in the purse - so returns it for a hopeful fee. Facts
That's a good kid.
He’s so cute , but he did Ah good job !! Not many people would do this in todays world …
This is nice and all but it’s sad that the world is so messed up that someone returning your purse is newsworthy, but good on him. Makes me happy
Stop calling and act like he didn’t jus look at the license photo and be like she bad bruh 😂 finna go check this shi out 💀💀
Kid ever got paid tho??
Mom raised him right good for him for doing what was right! He got rewarded for it. ❤️👍
the way homey was holdin the purse when returnin it tells u all u need 2 bout how correc dude is. good shyt.
He was hoping to get some after he already saw it was only a few bucks and tampons
We need more videos like these to show positive examples of the youth. Maybe it would become contagious
"Never judge a book by it's cover"
kid got raised right
GTA side mission
This is the way Japan is. Mostly. I wish the rest of the world would be like this too.
What an amazing young man, I hope that he succeeds further in life and knows he has people that support him.
What if she and him staged it and make it look like that to put on gofundme then split the donations ? They cant never prove these ppl know each other
Feels good to see a positive video for once
what a sweetheart
good news is the best news
What a wonderful young man. If I were his parents i would be so proud.
I found a lady’s purse so I rode my bike to her house and she gave me $20
What a great kid.  Just makes me feel good that he did that.
Totally beautiful 😍! What a lovely story. This young man is such a blessing to the world and will do great things. Yay!!!
100 percent sure he returned it because he saw the id and it was a pretty girl lol
I would love to see him getting the money tho
Hopefully she gave him same vag too
I'm so proud of him!!
Bro was trying to Hit fs after seeing that Drivers license😂😂😂
His mama raised him right🙌🥰
They should of just give him a B&HJ he would of love that from those 2 beautiful women   Baloney honey and jelly sandwiches 🥪 is what that means 😅
What a good young man 👍 .
🥺 this is the kind of content I’m here for
Outstanding young man. Keep up the good deeds sir
Stories like this should be what makes headlines, not negative events.
“My mom always taught me to do the right thing even when no one’s watching ( God is watching; HE is omnipresent) and If I lost my stuff, I would want someone to bring it back to me”.  This young man’s mother taught him well. If there were more teenagers in society like him. Kudos to his mom for raising him to do right, not wrong/bad/evil.
Gang banger will go back too the judge and say see I’m a good boy your honor
Wow. This is just the kind of story and video a lot of us need to see these days, amidst all the constant negative news and social media culture. Thank you to that kid and to his mom.
average ohio
Man this restores my faith in humanity mom you raised this young man good
That’s his mom and her friend 😂 they just scammed everyone 😂
My man wanted that girls number for real
👊🏻
The values that parents instil in their kids is beyond the price of gold.
Good man
Good kid. Respect.
What an amazing kind, honest, respectful young man. The world needs more people like this.👏👏👏👏🤜🤛💜
Good job for him and whoever raised him.
Eliana is stiff of emotion
Crazy thing is, if he was pulled over by a cop before arriving he would be sitting in jail.
Its good to hear this kind of stories happen even if once in a while it give us more faith and trust in humanity👍
you can find money but you can’t find good people
I am imagining the sequel :How my parents met". Thou I do not know how old the niece is.
EDGAR, EDGAR, EDGAR!
Now that's a boyfriend material
We all know he just wanted to meet her so he could smash...
I see why you did that, kid. Jk
Honesty and Integrity. This kid was raised really well by his parents. Kudos to him!
Hermoso ❤️❤️
Bless him
Bless him
Nice work man! Praying God continues to bless you. And you continue to be a light in this world showing others how they too should behave! 👍🏼
he definitely got head
Need more young men like this
He wanted some cheeks
We still got hope in the young generation
I also left my purse at the shopping cart and when I got home somebody put it on our mailbox. Thank God 🙏
HE WAS A MEXICAN KID WITH A WHITE KID BRAIN ....
What a great kid kudos to his Parent/ parents
He looks like the thief to me lol. Clever ruse if so.
Good kid.
Handsome and respectful what a gentleman 🥰
If her DL pic was ugly.   He would’ve left it lmAaoo
🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎
So nice to see this story.  What a nice young man.  Good for him.💙
I'm an atheist ( I don't follow any religion or really care about anything related to it. But I do believe in a form of Karma. Do to others what you'd want others to do for/to you & kindness will eventually return to you.

❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏🙏🌎🌎🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️🌎🌎❤️❤️❤️❤️🌎🙏❤️❤️🙏🌎🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🌎❤️😊
Too bad government officials didn't take a page from this honorable young man. Do the right thing.
What ticks me off is guys like this get rejected for being too nice
Decent young man. Mom did a great job.
Integrity goes a long way. Good job dude 😎👍
I found a purse at a store as well.. Found the person and yeah nothing else came of it lol. Its the right thing to do.
There was always hope for us it's the older generations
I know why he returned it. He saw the photo ID and was like damn. I want a date with this person
Cool dude! That’s the type of friends you need in your circle! The type of friend that’ll steer you away from trouble instead of encouraging your to do Trouble! You just don’t find them like that anymore but there’s some still out there!
nice boy!
Bro was really just tryna shoot his shot at ms eliana 😂🙇🏻‍♂️🙇🏻‍♂️🙇🏻‍♂️
I bet most people look down on him just because of the way he looks; not everyone that dresses in a suit will be Lex Fridman
Why isn't there a lost and found? You can return the purse without wasting time driving to the actual house?
this is so cute 🥲
Now if the rest of the world follows it would be a really nice place kids would act right and not like they don’t have common sense seriously props to his parents
what a gentleman. He has a bright future ahead of him.. <3
It’s amazing what can be done when people come together and do the right thing.
Bro saw what they looked like and jumped into captain save a hoe mode😂😂😂😂
what a great kid
he’s fine 😭
😅😂He saw that ID picture and he was like I’m gonna go get me a cougar🎉
If he does this for the rest of his life yes
Just a lil research that kid played a gamble and got paid
Hope he actually gets the money from them
Awesome he did that. Beyond sad and pathetic we think that it's amazing and rare. It should be the norm. It should be expected. He deserves the reward, and he is setting a great example. But it's sad that doing the right thing is so surprising to everyone
I honestly would have been afraid to open the door because this world is crazy unfortunately I would have thought he was trying to hurt me or something holding a purse and all … mine or not
he saw her ID & wanted to see that in person 😂
Translation: momma would whoop his ass if she found out he didn't do the right thing good for him for having morals
Should have smashed. What a waste.
THAT WAS AWESOME THANK YOU SIR FOR DOING THE RIGHT THING!!!!
What a great young man..!!
It’s nice to know that there still good people this time around….GOD BLESS YOU BRO….
Plot twist he tha 1 who stole it
is a good scene for Brazzerz
That nice of these young man to bring this lady her purse back that's what you call a real man with a big hearts may God bless him
Yay!!!  I left my purse in a grocery cart as well.  I always push my carts to the cart area and drove home.  As soon as I got home I realized! 😳 I drove back and there was my purse.  It happens... just moving too fast.  Bless this young man tho!💝
Good job my brother
Yes!
he went there cause the girl on the license was a baddie. end of story
That’s just awesome GOD bless his mother for teaching him well
Smart street kid. Knew there would be more reward in returning the purse.
Way to become rich:  - steal someone's purse secretly - "find" it and bring it back - get a fundraising by them - earn more cash with the fund than with the cash in her purse
Young man doing good deeds!!
We need kind people like him in this world
Hootie and the blowfish.
and he’s cute
Finally a nice story good job young man
Give me that money please
He returned the bag to secure the bag 💰
Do a good deed and don't tell anyone
This is awesome, thanks.
What an awesome guy! Also, you two ladies that was great that y’all rewarded him.  Maybe his mother should be teaching her skills to others because she obviously did an amazing job raising him.
Good Karma
So much respect to that man
Cringe comments
We live in a world where it’s time to find good peoples and reward them which is 90% bad peoples robbers living according to the video explains
It’s refreshing to see a teen have a good heart and still listening to what mama taught him . Glad he got rewarded for being a good person.  Something he can tell his children one day.
The fact this makes the news, says a lot about the ppl today, like it's exceptional something like this happens... 🤔
Ask her to have her thyroid checked.
yeah this guy  definitely bought da gas pack after dis🤣
That’s really nice. I’m glad there’s still good people out there.
Your the embodiment of Humanity Dear Kiddo  Keep it up
❤❤❤
I've done so many good deeds but good karma is a luck game. And I have terrible luck
Good man
God bless him
There is still hope for humanity, here is proof.
looks like an expensive purse. prolly could have sold it and earned more. jks
🇵🇬🇵🇬,,,
Indeed. !
Kinda feel like crying, there’s great kids in this younger generation.
👩🏻‍🦱:Here’s 3k thank you Me: Nah you can keep it but you see my erecti…
Cool story ❤a bloke in our town lost $10.000 off the roof off his car after he left the bank 🏦 lol 😂 this other old timer picked it up ⬆️ it didn’t take long before the driver was freaking out driving up ⬆️ and down the street looking 😂whilst his mates sat on the bench outside the newspaper shop laughing 😂 at him they shout out what’s going on their dick ? No I lost some money boys ! Aww this money lol 😂
HIS NAME IS LIKE MINEEE >/3
That teenager deserves that 3000 dollar reward.
Thought it was Smokey for a moment.
What a strong foundation of parenting can do...
He probably stole it and gave it back for the money
What a sweet young man.
If I find a wallet Imma write down all the card details on paper, return it for a reward, then a year later I'll use the credit card and no one will ever know 😈
she had her friends id's in case she got pulled over lol thats common. lol but it paid off. and he just wanted to clap them cheeks
You shall reap what you sow.
🐒 I REMEMBER YEAR'S AGO I RETURN SOME BOOK'S TO A LIBRARY AND DIDN'T RECEIVE ANYTHING.....PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY WERE PAST DUE.
I returned a purse from a lady that didn't even know it was missing her son's friends took it threw it out in the middle of the road 20 blocks from where they lived I returned it and didn't even get a thank you
Maybe there's hope
I don't believe it.
Why did this almost make me cry
What a dweeb
❤👍🏽
I need to find somebody's purse and return it
It’s San Diego, that’s why!
There was no cash in the purse and all the cards were declined that’s why he returned it💀
The kids a champion with a great mom
This gives me an idea  Steal as many purses as you can, look at their id\ drivers license and see where they live, and return them a few hours later saying you found it blah blah. And get rewarded, not for all of them, but Atleast 1
No he came up he just felt bad afterwards and returned it back
Yeah if I would have saw the photo ID i would have returned it too hoping to get something in return and it’s definitely not money lmao
Plot twist his homie stole it , they share the reward
Good job Mr. Rodriguez! And bless your mother, too!

Just all around all good people
Well sometimes doing the right thing is the cause of loss. I will never teach my kids to "do the right thing". Only an opportunity for tragedy
Dude will be blessed beyond the 3k
All I can say is, "Wow".
I found a purse in a shopping cart once, I took it right back in the grocery store.
What a GOOD guy! Blessings on him and his family!
Bro forever a king for this W

Ji prince of Cali

John 3:16  HES the answer
Nice
Much respect for the kid because that’s very rare nowadays I saw a manager at Walmart going through someone wallet he went straight to the money part in the wallet
✊🏾
bless him lord
He fell in love with the lady when he saw her pics!
L 🥱ever heard of finders keepers?
I don’t like inside edition but this was good.
W teen almost adult
That is one awesome young man!!! Good job to his mom❤
It’s rare that you hear stories like these like the ladies said there’s hope isn’t God good everyone be blessed
He stole it
Plot twist: He stole the purse in the first place.  It’s the new thievery technique taking the world by storm!!
*Respect +++*  (Sand Andreas Theme plays*
God is good
no one asking why he say a purse in a cart and decided to take it? like how did he know it was stollen
The definition of good deeds always come back to you 🙏
It’s called Integrity 💯
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Dudes a real one forsure
He's a good person mama did good
Why he kinda 😍
God bless ❤
That's exactly it.."we gotta do the rite thing,even when no one is looking"!! 🙂
what a lucky guy as most people would just be like oh thanks mate and then just shut the door and even if anyone did give anything it might only be like 50 pound 100 pound maximum
He seen tht driver license and went to run down on shorty well done playa
Why he gotta be 17 tho 😕 😭
Awesome citizens!!
OK, so where’s the part when they give him the reward???
A bug company needs to hire him! Proof of integrity, trust and honesty. This kid will go places and exceed with abut of nurturing. A future leader for sure..
I wanna be his homie fr😂
He looks like JI
Respect his hustle. If there is no or low cash in the purse it's better to see what kind of reward you'll get
Good parents=good kids!!!! Great job youngin!!!! 💪🏼
I returned a wallet with $800 in it and got a thank you, this man got $3k and a video WTFFFF!!!! good guy though
I would’ve been skeptical opening the door. You never know what kind of trick someone could pull to break in your house.
I would of done that as a kid if I had a phone with gps. I have it to the cops before
This Adrian is proud of that Adrian put some respect on the name 🫡🫡 😂
Once when I was younger, I found a house phone in the middle of the street. I called my moms house with the phone to get the name. Looked it up in the phone book and found the address. Found the house, two of my friends went with me. I returned the phone and the man rewarded me with $1. ONE! To split amongst the three of us. 😢😂
this is so nice🤗 also respectfully hes so fine
That was awesome!! Don’t judge your books by it’s covers!! ☝🏽❤️🙏🏽
💕 preciosa 💕
🥰
Good man
Crazy how this is a news story bruh
Rich people give other rich people money..... HOW HEARTWARMING HAHAHAHAHA im going to eat you.

Best californian in california

👏👏👍
Great job mom and Dad. Amazing job young man!
Damn what an awesome kid. If I were me I'd probs just take it to the lost and found center of the store I was at. Good on him.
I found a wallet of a student I paused my work for a hour searched for this veutnam girl she had 2  $100 bills first looked everywhere for her as all them look same so i was asking the girls u lost a wallet everyone no no no 100 s of nos in the end I've decided Ill keep the $200 give wallet to girls students so they can take it to the reception I hope I did good 😭😁
so this rare in your country?  LOL
That lady can't speak English? And how long has she lived here smh
Aye man say man i aint the only one thinking what im thinking😂
It should have been me dammit
Kid didn’t need it with those chains on
He's got my vote for teenager of the year
He bouta get some honest and kind coochie or bussy, respectfully
It’s so sad that this is such a big deal nowadays. This used to be normal human courtesy 😂
Best of luck to that young man
What gta side quest is this
God is good
He was like damn she’s fine
Finally some  positivity
Rodriguez in California? Sounds like a bad hombre.
Just saying.. This happens more than you think, it's just rarely on camera and people aren't doing it for the recognition.
This makes me so happy 😊
See how when a black person does something wrong the racists say "This is why I don't ____ (e.g trust to be around them without being shot)" but according to that logic they NOW should say "see this is exactly why I trust all black people"
Momma is beaming with pride as she should. All moms should strive to instill these values.
Great parenting!!!! Great young man as well!!!!
Looks like a bad kid but really is nice guy
Edgar W
Not a lot going on upstairs for the chick who left her purse in a shopping cart
Thank God for people and stories like these, there is still hope
Jesse pinkman hard man to find
Kudos to him. But not stealing money from a purse you found should not be such an extraordinary thing everyone makes it out to be
Last time I did this, the lady snatched the purse out of my hands and told me to get the hell out of her neighborhood. She had left it in her shopping cart right next to where i parked at the grocery store
Man just wanted a shot on that milf
Great kid, great parents.
I did that too whit a cell phone,thank you bye
Man I love that accent. Sorry y’all I’m just waking up, horny as an ox😂😂
We need more people like him 🥹❤️
i love this
❤😅
💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
Bruh should of asked for the digits lol
God or the universal good energy still inside of us
First , salute to that man not many like us . N second the gofundme caption they put was funny 😂… thirdly the purse owner better of took him out for dinner
This dude give future generations hope. Unfortunately, he will be a rarity in a society
Boy was trying to smash that biscuit 😅
He shoulda kept the purse tho, he looked very chic holding it
2050: 👁 👄 👁
Looks like. Birkin Bag he knew lmao $$
Hugs to him. What a sweet young man.❤
Had to stop by and say that I'm excited to see things of this nature.
No hope She got lucky
What a nice story to hear in the crazy times we live in.
I have something you lost maam
He’s an awesome young guy. Morals, principles and he listened to his Mum’s wisdom.
Dressed like a tough guy with a heart of gold. I need to introduce my daughter to him!
Such a great young man!
Good kid
$3k??? is that all 😒
Fantastic young man. A true reflection of his parents.
I wish everyone was like this guy
What a pair of annoying women 😴😴😴😴
"Fine Young Man Raised By Parents Right" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
To see this about a young man To find a purse and find the adreese to return the purse to the owner And has a very big heart to the ones in need of help He has been brought up the right way To have that word of rescept for everyone Great show
God's always watching and blessed him for doing the right thing 🙏....
My guy top man💯😎
That’s what you’re supposed to do 💯
Bless him
He saw the pic on the ID and said bet ima take it back she fine
nice seeing it , very rare diamond 💎
Let's be real he looked inside and saw nothing worth taking haha jk. Good job dude
Foo just wanted to clap
Fake ass news
He’s deff mexican cause Mexican moms don’t play about stealing
I’d have wanted blowing
I know bro stole the purse💀
If I returned that same purse they would have called the police.
There’s still good people in this world , bless his heart !! Great job buddy😎
Mad respect to this young man.he was raised well.God bless him
His parents raised him right
He will go far in life with a outlook like that man has. He's a man!
Kudos to his mom!
Gta told him he may get an award
God Bless this young man. And God Bless these ladies.
Thanks for spreading positivity and not hate  💯
Good things will get rewarded but not all the time. Just because you do not get rewarded for a good deed does not mean that you shouldn’t commit good deeds!
I did this very same thing but that night after some drinks I slept with whoever’s wife opened the door.
Wow..
This is amazing
Here me out yalll
dear mann vid irl
Omg he is goated! What a fkn legend, such a good guy! He definitely deserves that money plus some!❤
W EDGAR
May God give this Young Man Guidance and Peace.
Integrity 👌
Seems staged.
Good kid. Parents raised him right.
I’m not gonna lie, most kids that dress like that will not be bringing your purse to your door. Big respect to that kid and I hope he gets blessed with good health and wealth because we need a lot more people like him in this world!
Does anyone else’s dog go crazy Everytime they hear a doorbell?.. we haven’t had ring in 2 years and my dog still freaks out when a video plays with the sound…
Alas…there is hope
Bro saw the girls ID and thought she was bad. He don’t care about being good, bro trynna get shawty
Almost thought that was a snake in the walkway lool
It’d be so funny if they staged this all just to make some money lmao
Always do a good deed. Because you never know when a camera is lurking around to capture your good deed. And a reward might be waiting 😂
Good guy, hope he has a good life 👍
Forget that money I would of asked for a date or 2
Love this! ❤️
Respect ✊ great job dude .
he’s so handsome
Ayo fool, you lef yo purse. Jus thot I shuld return it yo no?
Way to go young man
The crazy thing is them the same mfs who call u a gangsta
The only hope for this young generation is a personal and spiritual encounter with Jesus God,  the light of the world.
Great job dude. Thank you good people.
So....he didn't rip her off and that's an amazing and legendary standard- so much so, that he should get paid thousands for not ripping her off....setting the bar low.
Absolute Brill
very sweet
It’s upsetting that this is the minority. A lot of kids will take it and not be ashamed
Very Nice story I hope many more good things come his way. Fine lad.
Good job,bro!
Yea proud to be born in 2005
WOW! Not sure this day & age many teenagers would have done what he did....kudos to his Mother for raising him to always do the right thing! Even when nobody is looking!  God Bless these two women & the community for recognizing a good,honest human being and rewarding his kindness!  Kindness does prevail, in every situation!  Kudos to you, Adrian Rodriguez; for listening to good advise from your mother. You will do well & go far in life!  😇🙏❤️
Amazing job to this young man's mother!!! What u put into this Universe will be what u get back from it so I know great things will happen for him 🙏👏👏👏👏
Excellent character young man!  Keep up the great work on being a God fearing, person who shows love and kindness to humanity.  May God bless you abundantly.
Shoulda gave lil bro some neck
Dudes completing side quests and getting good rewards damn.
She should've ate his as!
good job young man you have my respect
🥺♥️ such a good kid. I hope my son does the same
Why he kinda…
What a great 😊 human he is for returning the purse 💫💫💫🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Aweeee period ❤
No
What a wonderful story to restore my faith in humanity after seeing so many negative reports these days. His parents should be proud of the fine young man they have raised
nice brah
Good Job Bro! 👍
Imagine that in this day and age this is the exception instead of the rule
Please notice his race, his clothes, his jewelry, his hat - and remember that next time you want to label people who look like him as thugs!!
Way to Go
Hey came for some poon
Such a great kid !!! 😭😭😭😭🥰
These moments still make me have faith in people today
He's a good man!
What a great guy. Proud of you man. I saw a near blind guy at the gas station drop a $100 bill so I picked it up and handed it to him. He started crying because he's on a fixed income and needed it desperately. I had counted change to get gas that day but good karma came back a few weeks later when I needed it most. It does pay to be honest & do the right thing. Not financially but it sure does feel good to do. I think about him often. Hope he's doing ok and that if it happens to him again whoever sees it will be honest. He's on SSI and that's not much. Certainly not enough to have any breathing room.
That's sooooo amazing ❤️
Good job! 👍🏻 his momma proud af lol
hats off to you young man.
Reminds me of the town of Chillingbourne.
Respect to this guy! 💯
It's do unto others as you would have them do unto you. It's from the Bible, the rest of the Bible is true too.
Both y’all should’ve given him an experience he would never forget 😂
The world needs more of this
Thank You, Lord! No suspicion until he said maybe if I return it they might shoot me because they assume the worst but he did return it anyway. Amen
Dude. When I did this, They thought I was the one who stole it. 🙃
Pretty sure he won cuz the lady and her friend pretty sure hooked up w him and he got all that money he shoot 2 birds with 1 stone 😂
Wow!!! What a great story!!! ❤
Built like Eminem and I respect it
It’s crazy that we get credit for doing the right thing.
Wow they actually ended up raising $19,000 for this young gentleman. Amazing, let’s keep more stories like this going!
Great job, Adrian and great job to his Mom for raising him right.  What a stand up gentleman.
That’s a good thing always give stuff to people who it belongs to and showing respect.❤️
Bro Looks like J.I😂
I wouldn’t want the money as a reward, give me those two women and we good 😂
God bless him. 🙏🏻❤️
Funny
I left my purse in a shopping cart at a local grocery store. The cart wrangler turned it in to a manager, right after he helped himself to the forty dollars I had in it.
Shoutout to him and the ones who raised him.
thas a real G right there
lil piff ting
i done this  the guy said thanks as he was turning his back and shut the door in my face i was expecting a better reaction for going out of my way and finding where they live walking a few km to there place and giving them it
That lady has a RING video doorbell. Got the same one, can tell by the bell tone
Wow what a stupid women, it not his 1st rodeo.
Excellent people on both sides! I wonder if this will encourage people to steal a purse and have a buddy " return" it in the hopes of getting a reward? Perhaps I've gotten cynical.
El cuhhh did right
He still looks like a little trouble maker .. a couple days in juvenile hall would be a good reward ..
Best video I’ve seen today
Soooo proud of this man. This is so refreshing to see after sooooo many crime and theft stories in my feed lately!! Thanks for sharing and rewarding him for honesty and kindness!!! 🥰🥰🥰
I wouldnt return it if im getting a $0 reward lol, nobody works for free
Reminds me of when I saved the kid from a dog attack I didn’t get no money 🤦‍♂️ I should’ve just let the kid get kid
Salue❤😢❤❤❤
He’s wonderful! God bless him.
If my brother found the purse he would've stole from it
❤️ love this story! ❤️
Can we just take a second to look at all of the neighbors that don't know how to park?!
Hell yea dude
If there's anybody out there that needs an honest individual with this kind of upbringing and character, consider furthering his higher education and or offer him a good paying job opportunity with your company. His character is definitely an asset to our society. Best of luck and good things to come your way young man.
So basically her friend wasn’t gonna do anything to help nice. Yeah there is hope but not when people don’t given a reason for it
He stole it
A son raised well and listen to what his mother taught him ….
He could recycle that glass and pot-metal around his neck and get a whole 18 cents!!
Good kid
Why arent there more vids like this
God is pleased with good deeds
This guy has to be blessed. Protection, huge financial blessings, brilliance, infinitely great job and infinite joy all his days. Serio, this isn’t easy to do people. Being under 18 shows how amazing the youth can be. So happy to see good in the news. Great story!
Nice👍
It is a win win .. I personally feel the kid did a right thing and the person lost the bag also kind and rewarding the kid’s act. This is awesome effort from the both side
Pay attention tiktok..He didn't have a camera crew to witness his good deed
Well done Adrian
Shoulda let homie hit black haired lady she fine asf
1 in 1000000000000000000000000. Good soul
Wonder how it would end if he was black 🤷🏾‍♂️
Mexicans. all of them
i saw this on ig months ago 😂 he probably thought she was cute & wanted to get her insta & # 😄 i C you playa 👏🏼😈
I would drive to Elianas house as well 😉
This looks like start of a porno
It bothers me when people say things like "there's hope for the younger generation" as if the younger generation was hopeless, that doing good things is rare for them, or they're destined to turn out badly.   They're not. The majority of the younger generation will chose to do what they think is the right thing, whether that's bringing it to the person's door or handing it in at the police station. Each generation says the same thing about the next generation, as if the next gen is growing up without morals and values. The morals and values may be different to what our parents taught us, but that's just how it's always been.   I'm a younger millennial, but I love what I've seen of Gen Z so far. They're so funny and clever, they're not afraid to stand up for what is right, they're more accepting of people, they're not afraid of being themselves, or talking about difficult or taboo subjects. I think they're brilliant, and they've got a great future ahead of them. They have a lot of potential to change things for the better, especially when it comes to school shootings, mental health, and the environment.
Human 😊action always rewarded!!Great Job..
Thats very good, I think the reward is unecessary though. He was doing it because its the right thing and with reward we end up tainting  that pure motive, because we will expect something next time.
Sad this is some surprise as the media only pushes doom and gloom on us every day
why ppl getting rewarded for doing the bare minimum?
We need more people like this ❤❤
niceeeee
It's so sad that this is news... just bc it should happen more often. Returning things instead of stealing things. Ykwim? Bless his heart! We need more ppl like him.
Good man!
When your kid is raised right
This is called common courtesy
❤
This one out of a million don’t have hope for the youth
Whats his @ hes fine af
Wow..I'm surprised she said she heard the door bell ring and opened the door. Don't think I would be doing that. He has his hand in his pocket so you just never know what the intention is. I would have asked what he wanted and then said please leave the purse there thankyou. Then did a follow up on the person to make sure they were not a criminal or anything. Me not so trusting to just open the door. But turned out ok so good on him for listening to his mums wise words growing up.
The Girl on the right can get it
🥰❤️
We need more people like him
What an awesome young man! I would be very proud of him.
She trying to be his suger mama
Good job young man!!! I’m a 34 year old adult male that’s been struggling with always wondering if there were still good people in this world today. You proved that to be true. Thank you for doing the right thing & teaching me a lesson.
First class young man. First class
Shoulda gave my boy a good ol HJ or BJ
That young man is helping to resort faith in humanity
Good job I’m so proud man😅👏🏻💯👍🏻
Why is this such a shock 🤷‍♀️ this happens so much in England
Never judge a book by its cover
I remember one time being on the bus with my mom and these two ladies got off but one of them forgot their purse so I saw it and hurried up and threw it at her before the bus driver could close the door I felt so good about it that my mom didn't even notice what happened
Gts lucky moments
Kid should be President. Better off with him as opposed to those aspiring to be one.
My little brother is this kind of guy. Salt of the earth.
Awesome young man. Keep doing what's right  and you will be rewarded over and over. Great parenting on his mother's parents. 🦋
he fyne af
His mother needs a Thank you too.
the fact that this is literally the BARE minimum. the only reason i hate that this is being celebrated so much, is that. like, it’s what everybody should do. and it sucks that not everybody does it.
❤❤❤❤
I wish we saw a lot more stories like this one in the news. Too bad all the news likes to talk about these days is drama and other negativity.
I'm pretty sure if the boy was white he will keep it for himself 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Good Kid
Rewarding the right person 💫😇.. his mom must be proud of him.
Respect.
This is so Awesome 👍 because right now I work overnight and I work with a bunch of young rude ass young people who think they know it all and never work, their just on the phone all the time and never get in trouble ticks me off, but good for this young guy he deserves the money he got, God bless 🙏
Beautiful outcome ❣
That's one stand up dude. Kudos to that young man.
This kid is most better and decent than Trump
W kid
Good kid...dont judge a book by its cover
He was probably just hoping she’d let him smash when he saw her ID in the bag lol
Well done Adrian!
Solid dude. I suspect that not to many kids his age would do what he did. He's a real one.
I hope it’s what people say in the comments but could also be that he took it when no one was looking.
He gave it no because there was no cash in there and just cards with a women’s name on 😂
What an awesome dude!
😥
But, it’s sad when doing the right thing isn’t even expected.
Not all heroes wear capes. Good job dude
Good job
Bless him
This my type of content
he wanted ain’t want money😂😂😂
His mama raised him right!!!
he’s fine. does he have ig?
I’m crying😭😭😭
Damn this foo wears long socks Forsure 🎉🎉
Good guy
😢😢😢❤❤❤
Good job Bud!
Imagine if police got to him first before he got to her home. He wouldn't be alive now😬😬
Sad to see everyone hyping this guy up for doing something right. Let’s you know how f’ed up the world is.
That's wassup !!
His mama is Proud 💯❤️❤️
I have raised my son the same way to do the right thing if he every found a purse or wallet.
What a great kid.
Hi
That kid will be a Politician someday. he was raised well by his parents.
He’s so cute and his personality
W kid
He saw the money and thought he was having a good day, and then he saw her driver license photo and was like "Mami I'm coming to be your hero" 🤣
Is that all she gave him for a reward? Hmmm
Somebody told Doja cat that I'm trying to return that.
Such a great young honest man.
I was walking in my door and notice a wallet with money and cards.i saw an ID and returned back to the owner.
We're all like this when not we're not preyed upon. When a people steals everything from our people... ...and we still have enough compassion to not steal from them.  Gods amongst men 🗝️👑
Lovely story 😊
this is rlly sweet.
good souls
Very good honest young man. 👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
A good deed shouldn’t be rewarded financially
i think i feel in love
what an awesome dude!
I live in San Diego and I did not hear this story. This is so very impressive. It would have been easy enough for him to keep the purse and perhaps anything of value in it but so proud of him for returning that purse and kudos on getting a nice reward. You deserve it ❤ good deeds deserve to be noticed. Save that $3000 or use it wisely😁🙏
👍😊❤
Well done kid your a gentleman and will go far in life with those morals may god bless you and keep you safe 🙏❤
Woman after a month: wait that is not my purse.
Just love it! ❤️  Love this story so much... Good for that young man, and I will pray God blesses him many times over in return.
How nice of that 17 year old teenager returning a woman’s lost purse that was left behind at a grocery store. Hats off to him for that surprising moment. 👍
Id return it too,but screw the money gimme them digits
His mother show him very good values. That's kids don't have anymore. But I'm so happy to see their still hope in our youth. God blessed this young man.
Sounds like a dhar mann title 💀
Obviously fake.
Para que se vea que no todos los latinos son malos. Él un buen chico.
a lot of ppl that do that expect a reward too j keep that in mind
👏👏👏 For all parties involved
There is hope
If I had the opportunity I would tell that young man that what he did was righteous and to stay the course he's on. It might not always pay dividends but in the end, it will pay off in the long run to always retain your honor. You can never buy honor back after selling it.
when I tried to do the same in UK women called the police they take my fingerprint on the staircase and after all, women slap the door without even thanking me I guess I was lucky this time.
he jus wanted to shoot his shot
He prolly saw that ID an was like "good lawd" and gave her "back" something else then her purse to deserve that 3gs
I always return everything and have had my wallet with 500 cash returned to me with everything inside 😭
Right on
Ima do everything in my Power to ensure that MY Adrian is like this Adrian some day
GGS bro, this shows karma always comes back to you, good or bad :)
Lady’s friend is a baddie
Very cool 👍😎
Help
This happened to me years back. I’m 41 yrs old now and this took place when I was around 22-23 yrs old. I had lost my wallet one late night in a Tops grocery store parking lot. I didn’t realize I had lost my wallet until way later on that night. The next morning around 11 am a gentleman who was in his early to mid 40’s at the time knocked on my door. I answered and said, hey you must be Brent because the driver’s license photo looks like you. I said omg this is awesome I thought i lost it for good after I went back late the night before to search and couldn’t find it. I had my bank debit card, credit card and $460 cash in my wallet. I offered him money but he said it’s fine you don’t t have to give me anything because I know how stressed I’d be if that happened to me. But I didn’t take no for an answer and gave him $100.     This kid is so awesome and I’m proud of him 😊
Not many like him, that's for sure!!
I swear on my life I did the exact same thing and when I returned the purse the owner accused me of stealing the money inside!
When I was 10 or 9 I had found a lost purse on a bus and I had told my mother, we went home and my mom had looked for some way to get a phone number or address and once we did my mom had called them up and told the woman that we had her purse, so my mother told her where to meet us and we went there, we gave her the purse and she wanted to give a $100 reward but my mother declined, later after they left we went to go get ice cream, pretty crazy day if you ask me.
Bro looks like Eminem
Nothing but love for this guy 🥺💜
Good job kiddo!
These two women look vaguely familiar
Wow awesome
Why this make me cry. I looooove this!
Love this❤️ his mom did a great job raising a young man
Sweet Kid like my 16 yr old too
Mama did right to raise him correctly.  This gives me hope!
There’s hope for younger generations, lets hope as adults to not mess it up for them!!
Grade job! however, I was brought up in Japan and this is not uncommon and never be news. hope the world becomes like that. An Asian comedian said "in the US, you get a reward for not punching others"
Don’t we wish there were more nice people like this in our world ❤
Kudos to him, and to his mama raising him right! Well done young man, you're so kind.
There is not very many people that would of given it back. He's a good young man and his mama what a great lady
Ahhh geez, what a good kid, good parenting mom❤️👍🏼🥰🔆🌈
Such good kid
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
This kid a real 1. How ever it ain't enough to restore my faith in humanity
Lovely to see these days
Not to be a downer but the fact that this level of reaction is garnered by someone doing the normal thing in this situation is sad lol. Shows how wayward and jaded we're becoming as a society.
What a good fella. Stay good always. This world needs you.
Good rearing mum👏
pretty sure the dude stole the purse and gave it back cus it had nothing in it
He gonna be a good husband
he wanted to hit, quit playing!
One good deed deserves Another,,, you ladies did right by that young Man💞💘 everybody WiNs🌟🎀
It's so nice to see well-mannered and kind young adults. Your parents should be so proud 🙌
And now the world knows he has $3K! 🙄
What a good boy!! Dude I’m in tears that’s beautiful
We ONLY Need Stories Like This On News! Made Me Happy.. The Shifting Of Consciousness Has Begun! 🌍💚💙🌎
Proud of him. God bless him. His parents really proud of him
That gives me hope - lovely young man ❤️
He saw the 20 bucks and was like not worth stealing so he gave it back 🤣
I’m so proud of this young man. Love hearing positive stories like this one.

Much love Adrian! Much love. You’re a jewel in this generation!
He's a good youth
No good deed goes unnoticed.  We could all learn from this young man
Good job young man you were raised right
AWESOME YOUNG MAN!!!!🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻

Good dude, just be careful as there aren't many good people like you around.
Or he’s just returning a purse he stole
Thank you Adrian! God knows you did the right thing--he saw!!😃
Iam so extremely proud of that mother and son he was raised right
I bet he was hoping for a diff kind of tip hahaha
Very good young man. GOD BLESS 🙌
I'm happy to hear this
Much respect
why is everyone so shocked by this? this is normal
I wonder how much cost that purse
If our society had more people like this, our country would have hope.
brotha took one for the team
Good for him cause I’m a thief 😅😂😂
One in a million!!! So that still leaves 999,999,999 POS’s out there!!
amazing young man! thank you for doing the right thing and being an excellent role model for others!!
One question is were all of her things in her bag?
He’s so sweet that real respect right there.🤍but he def dressed look like Smokey from Friday.😂
He fine as hell
Character - doing the right thing when nobody is looking.
Wow....great young man!!
"my mom always told me to do the right thing" code for "the purse didn't have anything much of value so it wasn't worth it"
This is the only reason to return the purse, sorry but we all struggling
Good mum = good kid =good future dad . Fine young man, he deserves all the best things life can offer . Wish I could bosh him a few quid myself but brst I can offer is blessings and hope for his future. . All the very best son fi bonny Scotland, you're a total legend, your mum should be very proud  (I imagine she already is !) P 💖 x
POV: the kid check the bad but there wasn’t nothing good only make up
This kid later died in a school shooting yesterday at 4 pm
He probably seen the license in the purse and thought she’s good looking and could return it and maybe get a little hanky panky out of her.
Already watched it but it’s good he did that
HAHHaHAHAHHAH.  "A California teen performed a good deed"  NOW THIS IS NEWS WORTHY!
That kid raise right with her parents
Thats a homie og right there very inspiring THIS right here is how you be a badass kids
So proud of him n his parents !!!!!
Funny thing is, there was really nothing in the purse so it was returned.  😂
I’m sure he got more than 3k from these ladies
Props to this kid for the honesty. As a former thief among other things, it really hits home when you realize the things you used to do could have possibly wrecked a families life. Bottom line, be honest when you can be and treat everyone and everything with a base level of respect. If it's not yours, don't touch it. If you have some negative comment? Keep it to yourself unless it's absolutely needed.
Imagine, doing good is not normal anymore.
Good kid. Keep it up. Good things will come to you.
The thing about mom's lesson ... To the right thing treat others how you were wanting to be treated....great story!
Good job kid. Most days rich woman don't just leave their purses annnd most teens wouldn't return it.
Wait so hang on how did he know to send it to that address? I'm not saying he looked in the bag but???
That kid saw the pic and wanted the brownie points.
That kid good 👍🏼
If this happens often, these people will create great generations
he fine asl aswell
To anyone saying that he could have just sold everything in the purse to buy drugs but he returned it instead, this kid is smart he returned it got a 4k reward and money for the news using his story now he can buy even more drugs
Whole time he stole it 😅
Amazing good deed for that teen. 👍🏻
What a BLESSING!!
Wonderful!!!
I would have just kept the money but this is good sportsmanship
that smile on her face is  plastic  lol
such a fine and respectable young guy. great job parents bringing him up RIGHT
He’s cute
Amazing teen! Good for him. I hope he gets even more!
One time a lady left her purse on the floor after setting it down to tie her nephews shoe, I tried to return it and I got accused of picking it up and trying to walk away with it😒
More stories like this please! They happen- the news just doesn’t report on them
All good people ❤
Now that's someone I would be proud to call my child.
We were on vacation in Toronto one year and we went to the mall. I went to the restroom and there was a bag with a brand new pair of sneakers hanging on the inside of my stall door. I immediately took the bag to the security desk to turn them in. I hope the person got them back. My daughters were with me and I hope that they also will do the right thing when no one is looking.
What a dude! Wow! So nice.
He should have asked for a date with Eliana.  She is gorgeous. 😍
I have done this before but with ID cards.
Dude is a real homie🤙
Good young MAN!!
no cash inside he know he can gets some $$ for give back
It's awesome that go fund me exists. I'd like to give a humanitarian award to its makers
This generation has more of a tendency to do this than the last 4 generations. What is called snowflake ❄️ behavior is actually called being a decent person
he’s cute
Amazing, we need more people like that.😄
One time a lady at no frills unknowingly dropped her purse with hundreds inside and I gave it to her and I got nothing in return
Good people come in all ages, colors, ethnic backgrounds etc etc… cool!
Chad
do the right thing when nobody is watching
how much money was there
I think most people would do this honestly, especially since most people don't carry much cash on them these days.  There's nothing to steal.  Best you could hope for is a reward.  But hey, at least it's a feel good story.
A *very rare* sight among Generation Z
I wish I could see his parents face when they found out what their son had done.
Doing the right thing even when nobody is watching is called integrity. Something all these social media influencers could learn when they make "Helping a homeless person" video for likes and promotion.   Good job young man. Keep that integrity.
❤❤❤❤
I hate to say it but if you see a kid looking like that outside of your house at night ringing your doorbell and he isn't carrying a pizza you ordered, you probably shouldn't answer.  That's why this is a news story. It goes against what we all know to be true. Good kid, though.
💯 💯 💯
Well done young man....
Great to hear a great story like this.
Come on now.... I bet he thought the driving licence picture was lit! Probably thought he had the ticket to pussy passage with the 'my saviour' plus package included 😂😂🤣🤣
There is hope. We need more of this young man.
Outstanding young man this world needs more people like you. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Thats Franklin's house
What I would have done is: “First steal the purse and then when she says you’ll get a reward I’ll take the money out of the purse and also take the 3k award”
Yes. He will be blessed even more!
I’m sorry but he found a bag and gave it back to someone. Why does he get $3k that is how you should be raised. “He went out of his way” ?????????
Not only is he a good guy he’s cute too.
Wish more kids would follow his lead.. good job to his parents they raised him well ❤️❤️❤️❤️ god bless u boy
This comes to show , DONT JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER 🙏🏼🤍
Beautiful
So sweet
Love this!
Angel🙏🌻 God bless He was raised like I have raised my own. Do good... God is watching
lmaaaoo jhit only returned it cus it wasnt shi in there to steal 😭😭
Great deed❤
Imagine he just stole it and realized he could get a bigger reward by returning it💀💀
I found a lost wallet once outside a grocery market. It was filled with cash. For sure thousands. And credit, debit cards with tap. I immediately looked in the wallet to find a drivers license with an address so I could return it. I put the address into google maps and returned it straight away. Once I got to the house, I knocked on the door and the man was on the phone with the RCMP in attempt to help him find his lost wallet. He looked very worried. I told him I had his wallet, returned it into his hands and he was shocked to see everything was exactly there still, nothing stolen. He handed me a wad of cash. It was a couple of hundred dollars. I split that with my boyfriend who also helped me return the wallet.  I knew god/the universe sent me to be the one to find the wallet because I would never steal and the good karma was instantly returned ❤
Their always good young people around
Hats off to him such a wholesome boy 😊✨✨
I wouldn’t be surprised if they related and set that whole thing up im sorry I had to say it….
I turned in a wallet and got nothing, it’s the thought that counts and hopefully one day when I lose mine someone will return it to me 👍🏼
What a wonderful  young man,  many blessings to you ❤️
I found brand new looking  Louis Vuitton beautiful handbag in a shopping cart at Ross I went back to store found the lady gave it back to her.
Mans wallet with like 15 credit cards fell of the roof of his car. I got it & used the address in his license to get his phone number to return it to him. He asked me what I owed him & when I said nothing he looked at me like I was crazy or stupid  I couldn't tell which. He wasn't a nice man at all but his wife was. I often wondered why he was so unappreciative.
Never fails, behind good kids there's almost always good parents. Great job mom!
damnnn she's a baddie i would return the purse too 🥵
Good boy!!  Your Mama raised you right! 💖💖
He needs a modeling contract
This is what you call you dont judge anyone by its cover. In our country if youre like this gang fasion and etc or even with tattoos youll already be judged
Plot twist: He knew the woman and that she pays well or she's rich so he sent someone to steal it and brought it back to her.
Kiddos to the young man and his family.
I have hope in this generation
This is a big pet peeve of mine. You can’t be so callus and selfish to take something that straight up ain’t yours!
The second women is the most NPC ever 😂
That was refreshing, needed that! 🙌🏾
damn he fine too
Bless that young man 😇💖
He just tryna grease😂
This was so precious 💞
Good kid
OMG THIS MADE ME CRY!!...  MY GRANDMOTHER RAISED ME AND SHE ALWAYS SAID THE SAME THING.. "ALWAYS DO WHATS RIGHT WHETHER SOMEONE WATCHING OR NOT".. AND THAT NO ONE COULD EVER TAKE MY INTEGRITY OR CHARACTER, I WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD ALLOW IT TO BE TAKEN... 💞💞💞
W guy
I remember I left my wallet on top of my mom’s car & she drove off not realizing it was there cause my dumb self forgot. So eventually it fell on a busy street. I was literally panicking and figured someone took it, and important stuff I had in there were gone. Luckily someone found it & turned it into the police station. I was able to pick it up. Thankfully all my stuff was still inside. Idk who found it but thank you! Good people do exist still. ❤️
Keep it up 🙏🏼
Sheesh Gang gang
*I think her fren is a lil..slo- but yes the young man did a great deed*
how kind
What raising a kid well, does to a mf.
God sees abs he knows his heart God bless him for listening to his voice ❤ and he cute lol

❤ good job to the parents
Huge W
The younger generation is the nicest one yet, but unfortunately the environment is the worst yet.
Lovely story... good man...
I would of rather come in and get a dinner cooked by two sexy mamis as a reward 😛
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
good job lil bro
Plot twist he stole the purse and brought it back
Daddy
What a smart young man, I’m proud. He looked into the purse saw the womens ID picture and thought to himself hmm should I take the $20.. ? orrrr should I see if I can get me a sugar momma Latina MILF 😂
So he received 3,000 in the 700 and something you guys kept everybody wins that's koo
Good kid ☺️
❤❤❤
May God bless him and everyone. ❤
He did a side quest
Good thing these were understanding people because I tried returning a purse to a lady that had left it at the counter and was instantly blamed for stealing it cops were called thank god cameras showed what I was saying to be true. She apologized got in her car and left
He making all Adrian’s look good, appreciate it
If you saw him in the street you'd think he was a gang member, what a lovely young man to do this and he got Karma, $3K, well done to him. We need people like him.
This is the type of people we need
Bro did a good deed , he know what he doing 😏
❤
There's hope for America, after all.
Bro played GTA5 the wrong way 💀💀💀
Plot twist he stole the purse and returned it to get the 3k reward 💀💀
Even when no one’s looking .    but know god / universe is ALWAYS looking
If this kid was raised right why tf does he sag his pants 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1 out of 1 million still have 1 good teen
God bless him and his parents
hes hellaaa fine n respectful
And he looks attractive
I sure wouldn't give him $3,000 as a reward. First, I would see what he stole and then call the cops. I don't trust nobody and I mean nobody.
So awesome
He fine asf😍😍
Love seeing good mews
So nice of him
good job kid who gave the drivers license to the plastic
God Bless Him! ❤
Reader Jesus loves you and died for ur sins to save you from hell repent and trust Christ
It does say a lot about him, props to his mom & my respect to this young cat fr . 💯💪🏼
Real gangster helping the barrio
I went into a gas station bathroom before. Found a wallet sitting on the toilet paper dispenser. Gave it to the guy behind the counter. Nothing ever came of it tho. Also. If you find a wallet you can put it in a mailbox and they'll send it to them for free
Awesome 👏
Finally great news to watch 💖 love this

Someone stole my purse. I wish they would have just took the cash and left the pictures I had of my dad that I no longer get to see.
Adrian Rodriguez good job kid. You were selfless and the epitome of kind. God will bless you for this profoundly kind deed.

Dam that enough for a tank of gas in Cali
great kid!
Good job x
and he’s fine as hell
His parents should be very proud! What a beautiful young man!
My son found a woman's purse on a trail between houses in our neighborhood. He came home and we called the person as their info was on their checks in a checkbook. Her daughter came to pick it up. It just so happened that the daughter worked at the public defender's office, in juvenile division. She asked my son numerous questions and asked what he had done with the money. She all but accused him of stealing her mother's purse. He got scared until I had to step in and tell her to take the purse and leave. He didn't take anything and I didn't appreciate her accusing him with no evidence. She certainly wasn't appreciating the fact that her mother got everything back, except for a little money, I gather. It really soured him, but, we helped him realize that some people just can't be decent or grateful. Too bad some of those people work with children.
I would hope she lost that purse every damn day!😂😂😂😂😂😂
Chucky Cheese Story: OK   Over 10 yrs ago. Left my purse on floor of Photo Booth.  Several girls (3-4) picked it up & kept it. I watched the Security Camera with the Manager & sure enough . We saw the girls get up & leave the Photo Booth  with my purse. They could have taken it to the front counter but didn't. Called the Police & made out a Police Report.  But nothing came of it.  Those  girls didn't do the right thing at all.  K Bergman
This is great to see. Parents succeeded, they should be proud
Cool young guy 💯💙
The word is healing
I did that once. Then the lady claimed I stole it. I found it in a food court chair at the table I sat at at the mall I was in. That was my reward.
if it were an unattractive women would the same thing have happened???? No
No mam trust me there’s no hope.
Good job mom
I did the same thing and got 50 bucks. Won’t bother next time.
Very good kid 💪 good job Boy😊
Her friend ❤😻
What a solid video!
Wow 😊 what a great kid his mama raised him good ❤
Never judge a book by its cover ❤ this man, has such a beautiful heart!
What a lad
He has good up bringing and a good soul
What a good whippersnapper he was 👊🏼
Incredible that this is something strange, when should be the most normal thing in the world
Fantastic job young man 🙌🏾💯
This just proves to not judge a book by its cover
What a good kid. God bless him 🥰🙏😇
He didn’t get that money 🤣🤣🤣🤣
What a bloke
wow, i love this so much! what an honorable young man ❤
My mama and I found a phone on the train station 3 weeks ago. I tried returning it at the window with the person working inside but she gave me nasty attitude and basically refused taking it in case the person who lost it, came back for it. The owner of the phone ended up calling his own phone about 20 min later. When I gave it back to him that evening, he ended up giving me a huge hug and $60 🤷🏼‍♀️
I really wanna thank that kid for his kindness, giving back lost things, not a finder keeper. He was so raised right.
This is how a lot of….. nvm
Good story
With the state of youth these days, that was truly refreshing!! Awesome job to the parents!! A kid with morals!! I love it!!
I needed this today...  Good for you, young man.  I'm proud of you and I'm not even your mother!
Well raised boy we need more well raised children in the society
Awesome kid😎👍
he cute too
Very inspiring. There’s hope. Lovely young man.
No cause why is he so cute
Your jefita must be proud of you bro 💯💯💯
That’s a real American 👍
I like this kid carry on bro
Never judge a book by is cover real crooks wear suits and ties. Respect to this young gentleman.
Yes. Nobody gets rich from stealing or not being honest
Hope in humanity restored, God is good!
There is people out here like us I also don’t steal if I have a clue of who it belongs too then I will return to its owner if no clue than is mine
That’s a amazing story 😢❤
I had kinda the same situation once. Found a wallet in the middle of the street (had about 180€, some cards etc.). Inside, ID of the owner. Me and my parrents drove to adress and i gave it to the owner. His reaction: *he took it, checked if smtg is missin'*😐"ok good, have a nice day" I regret that i didnt give the wallet, or the money at least, to someone who rly needs it
Just so good
That’s nice! My dad found a wallet and a phone, both belonging to different people. He has returned the wallet, but we’re still waiting for the person who own the phone. It a good phone so my dad thinks it doesn’t make sense for someone to throw the phone out and we think they lost it so we still waiting
Damm I always keep people stuff 🤣
Damn maybe their is hope for humanity .
“Integrity is doing the right thing even when no one is watching.”  A beautiful example, good for him and thank you to those who raised him.
y’all acting as if this is smth special omggg
Is this dude an ese or something? He lives in San Diego and the clothes and hat.
It’s funny how when we’re good it causes so much good energy.
🙌🙌🙌🙌
I wonder how cute & young she looked on her ID & how disappointed he was that she didn’t answer the door? 😂
An amazing young man, may God Bless him many times over!🙏🏻
I have the same doorbell
It's sad we live in a society where doing the right thing is considered an anomaly and gets rewarded like it's something most people wouldn't do. The true reward is doing the right thing.
Kid was trying to bag himself a MILF.
17-Year-Old Returns Woman’s Lost Purse and Gets Grounded
His mum must be sooo proud!
Wow thats krazy to see him not recording it all and uploading it to tiktok for clout. Good job
Bless you and your family.  Love and respect from Texas
He done the right thing. And now he is blessed plus he has no karma to deal with.
Beautiful!
personally i would never do this
Good boy 👏
Plot twist: he’s the one who stole the purse
We should make a gofundme for this kid! He deserves it.
Looks can be deceiving. Good job lad!
Offer him a good job or a scholarship
a real man, a real g for delivering that purse back
He has integrity and honor. May he be successful in life.
Im proud of you brother . Thats real man
it’s called integrity. Exactly what is lacking in the republican party now. I want a candidate republican or democrat that has integrity.
Does anyone know his insta?
I once left my laptop in the bus and someone return it to the bus office, I was hopeless when I left it but that return save me so much
So lovely that they set up a go found me to reward him
Never in my life, my lost things have returned to me, infact theyre stolen. The lady just got lucky.
He wouldve had more money if he kept it
Gangsta with good moral
Howd the kid know where she lived?
I feel like this trend of getting money when you return something is setting (false) expectations
Adrián foineeeeeeee let me lose my purse rq😩😩
What a beautiful young kid. Just amazing. We should all be like this
It's kinda sad if this is news worthy in the USA.... This is so common in Canada this wouldn't even make the papes
So proud of him now i gotta search for a stolen bag
is he gonna pull up his pants though?
KUDOS to this young man….he has a lot of integrity & he will go a long way in life! 💜💜💜
❤️🙏🏾❤️
💚💚💚💚💚👑✨✨✨✨
"Theres hope for our younger generation"
With so many bad things happening daily... This is great to see.
He's hella cute too.
Good person!
Idk why she said "there's faith for this younger generation" that was unnecessary and uneducated from her because not everyone in that generation is a thief if that's what she's implying
The sad part about this is that this isn't a normal act of kindness. Yet it should be.
he was trynna clap lets be honest
Does she have something in her throat ?
He makes enough money selling drugs. He just wanted to scan her house to see if it was worth coming back in the night.
There’s still some good young people around willing to do the right thing, and parents teaching their children right from wrong
His mother should be proud, there is hope for the future.
Well done young man
Nice 👍
That’s great. Love seeing children raised right
He should have clapped them cheeks
Thats cool. I returned a package that went to the wrong address. The women opened the door and I said that the delivery person dropped with off to the wrong address. She took the package and and shut the door. No "thank you" no smile or acknowledgement. Just a aggravated look because it got sent to the wrong address. I did the right thing and that felt good. But at least a simple "thank you" would have been nice.
Amazing job for the mama who raised him right! ❤
Honestly kinda feel like his parents deserve a reward, too. Much respect and gratitude for producing a good human being. We need more like them.
Heart warming! Meanwhile I have had my used Bluetooth earbuds  taken from the gym and another pair outside a nurses office.  Also my supplements were taken out of my locker.      All in 1 week ! Never returned!   Over $100  of stuff. Thank god for this young man doing the right thing!
So other people paid for his reward not you? SMH
May God bless his heart.💖
Absolute legend.  I’m just thankful a cop car didn’t go past they’d have assumed he stole it, poor kid would be dead.
This kid is awesome
bro defo got head
Their still a lot of good souls in this world !
God bless him and his family!
Mama raised him right!!!
And he is ONLY 17 ....I know many full grown adults that would never do that!!!
Kid was raised right good for him did the right thing hat's off to young man
If that’s his reward he might as well have just kept the purse
Bro is doing a gta 100% run
What a great lad and bravo to his parents, you must be so proud of your beautiful son.
And this is common in India 💯
Rare Edgar W
That is fantastic! What a great young man!❤
this is so fake.  all she had to do was spit a few cliche lines like "do the right thing when no ones watching" and everyone ate it up. look at the top comments. everyone is so easily convinced these days is scary
Thank God for a wonderful mother and family who raised this young man well! It's so refreshing to see a young person do the right thing vs. all the negative things we see and read about. I hope this young man becomes a leader in his community. Governor of California would fit well in 20 or 30 years, and I hope to live long enough to see that happen!
Great mum brought up a decent caring young man.... thank you for sharing x
xhamster vibes 🤣
why in america film everything including small things like that
Bless you young man💞
❤❤❤❤❤
That's awesome!  Always good to see and hear these things!😀
I think he returned because he wants to hit it...
Good kid, gives me hope
Good job young man.
Why can't we have a news channel that just focuses on these types of good deeds and good people. Positive andJust heart warming news.
plot twist - there's nothing inside the bad only I'd with address 😂
Quick sidequest +3k
His parents must be proud, they raised him right and good😎😌
A great example of integrity. Well done!
He’s a good man.👌👌👌👌
Personally I would have stolen her identity
Those ladies could've at least invited him in and made him a nice dinner.
ermm good.. this is just an ordinary thing in muslim country
if only everyone thinks the same 😇
Hispanics ❤
We need more humans like Adrian in the world 🤗😇
Does anybody know his Instagram ?
🤔🤗
That's what's up!! Great Job Patents!!
There still hope in humanity 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼☺️☺️☺️☺️
this does not mean: DO WRONG THINGS WHEN EVERYONE IS WATCHING. Just Saying, Great Job Boy :)
the woman is also kinda well earned to give that much amount as reward.
Wow god bless him..
if we praise and reward kindness more than negativity and misdeeds as a society we can make this world a better place
Bless the kid and his Mom 🙏🙏🙏🌹
This young man is a few among the many these days. His mom raised him right and hopefully he keeps this mentality throughout all of his life. Amazing to see in these recent dark times.
Plot twist, there was nothing in the purse...
reporter: "why u went out of your way to return the purse?" me: "it has no money"
and all of gen z sucks
The world needs more people like him
finally something positive for once <3
sad, this world has come to a point where when 1 person does something good it makes the news smh for society. Great Kid!
He is very handsome
Inspiration for all young kids. I'll be showing this to my two boys. He did awesome!
Good stuff !
He definitely made his mama proud.
Kid made the right decision!
I will give him credit , he became a good person
Lost my wallet in NYC a good person returned it back to me and I sent him a thank you card and 20$ had important stuff in it bless this kid
He’s so cute standing there with the purse looking all ready to surprise them
Bro saw the I’d and thought she was bad asf so he had to return it to get a first hand look at that  🎂
This further proves I’m not lucky
good on him for being a decent person and good on them for hookin him up for it. this is what we need more of.
Homie was expecting a different reward 🤣🤣😏
Great job young man! I am very proud of you and God Bless You!
Wonderful story. The apple does not fall far from the tree.
So how did he get the address from a purse?
He so cute
Do you think there's hope because of one kid brought your purse back lady you should probably stop eating soap there is no hope for these kids
kinda amazed yall leaving purses in shopping carts and not even knowing u lost ur purse aswell after the fact lmaaaaaaaaao
Wow, in California, I can't believe it.
Just proves u can't judge a book by its cover.
God Bless him! And the woman for reaching out to find him...
Hellyatho ❤😢
Cool...all the best for his kindness
Plot twist-  kid originally stole the purse but pulled some type of reverse psychology in hopes to being rewarded for his generosity to which he stole the purse and then gets rewarded in the end
Come on guys, he looked at the license, saw she was hot and was trying to get a very special thank you. Obviously there was little to no cash in it
Yay!! I am so proud of him! Double Yay to his parents! You raised a good son! Bless his heart!!
At 17 seeing a baddie on Id 🪪…. Dude hit the cologne and the highway fast
Well done my friend.
Now THAT is a REAL man,  with a good parent/s (who deserve the credit also).
Good lad
Because it’s the right thing to do.  I did the exact same thing many years ago.  A woman left her purse on the GO (Government of Ontario) train.  I was getting off and took the bag with me. (Last station).  I looked up where she lived and dropped it off.  The conductor would have taken it back to the station and put it in the  “Lost and found” but as a woman, geez, to be without your purse for god know how many days to get it back… No I just drove it to her.  I’d want the same if it happened to me.  No reward necessary.  Bless her heart, she did send me flowers to my office.  (She took my business card)…
if that's his car, he's not struggling..js
hes knda fine
God bless that young man, but it is a shame that this isn't the norm.
You get what you give!
""there's hope for our young generation""  No no there isn't 😭🥲🥲
FINALLY, a video that, well, I was going to say, that did not make me cry-but it did IN THE BEST WAY. Omg  I’m raising all of my babies this way Good for him 🙏🏻❤he is a kind and honest soul And great on these women too- not only for rewarding him, but also showing others how kindness pays in dividends.   Blessings of health, safety, happiness, and abundance to us all ♥️❤️♥️♥️♥️♥️
OMG! I never thought I would EVER see this kind of thing this generation
Lord I see what you doing for other ppl 😢 can u send someone to bless me with $105 so I can retake my medical exam.  Send me prayer everyone🙏🏽
Damn he got the chains and hat stuffs too..... Most parents will look bad on him at first sight ..... And while looking like that + helping people out..... Mad respect bruh!.
I love stories like this. Especially when the good person gets rewarded.
He’s seen the drivers license and was like “oh yeah she bad I need to return this” LMAOOO
Good job 🎉
That’s a good person! We need more stories like this!
I know this is gonna sound crazy but this is just standard in Switzerland.
He's putting on for all us young men who have an idea of what it is like to be respectful, matured, and well mannered
3k?!
Good kid
Leave 3 bands in that purse and we have a dif story 😂😂
Good job hommie
This is probably a staged video...
Almost 4 bands for doing what’s right strait up W Karma
Good deed, but risky. What if someone sees you taking the purse into your car to drive away, calls the cops and they accuse you of stealing it. Nobody but you knows that you were going to return it.
Lil maru giving back lol
What a thug
gives me hope for the future! Great job kid and great job mom!
Im surpise no one else said it but we all know why he returned it.
👍🏼
gonna cry 😿
Wish it was me.  I could've used a praise break.
Men leave wallets. I didn kno women leave dey purse
Might as well have stolen it lol, plus how is kindness rewarded like that, maybe a drink or food but money and 3k isn't really kindness then, no one good will accept 3k, maybe couple bucks but no more, to each their own i guess.
He got the personality and the drip
Awesome now thats integrity
I'm glad he's Mexican, if the black thug found the purse he will never returned it
Is this seriously what the world has come to? Like this is the bear minimum and yet he’s getting so much praise because it’s so shocking that some one would do something as simple as return a purse? It’s just sad
Good kid
When my son was younger he saved money for a vacation he was going on with his friends family and he wanted to carry it around in his wallet but I was afraid because where we lived he might lose it. So I made him let me hang on to it but I for got to put it up and the wallet fell out of my pocket. When I realized I lost it I cried as I walk back to the store and a kind young man found it turned it in with every penny of his hard earned money. God blessed me that day. So when I found a pocket I payed forward and turned it in.
Reputation is what man thinks about you; character is what God knows about you. This young man has true character, and God knows it.
its cause she was cute y'all stupid
he’s fine
I mean maybe he saw her ID photo and thought maybe he’d be able to hit it for being a hero.
💙👍 well done a shining example of a child with a proper upbringing 🙌
That’s what’s up
Her friend defenitely thanked him 🤣
Aayyee I’m glad we share the same name
hes so fine
The mum should be so proud of her son and herself.
The world needs more kids like this man the kids I see genuinely scare me for the future
he just did it bc she was fine
I’m confused, was there ever not hope for the younger generation
MILFS
Teach others the same  Great job 👏
Instead of stealing it like other 17 yr olds would do, he didn’t.  Gen Z sux but maybe we have some hope., it’s just an maybe.
That’s AWESOME! He was raised by OUTSTANDING PARENTS!! Great JOB SIR!
😭😄
😭😄
all i learned from this was to start stealing purses and returning them to their owner a couple days later
thats crazy that this is a news story, in my area this is just what you do
He gives us hope for humanity.
This is how situation like that should go. Act like that must be rewarded good.
its 19k now that's insane!
Plot twist hes the one that stole it in the first place 😂
Never judge there is good and bad in all god bless
That's how you raise a child from the very beginning.
Brooooooo talk about being a benevolent human being. Can't give enough kudos to this guy
bro id be good with a night with them
He gonna be a gangster of good
Young man... cudos. Thank you sir
Why ts never happen to me 💀
we as muslim we raised up restrictily for this kind of manners , and there is quote that say whatever haram thing we eat will be like a hell fire on our stomeck
We know what bro was tryna do she bad
This would never be newsworthy in Japan or other low crime countries where its just the norm to be a decent human being.
Lovely inspiring measage, the human thing to do.
WOW I forget my purse in Napa coffee shop and someone return my purse, about  after a week, they just throw it in our front yard but took the MONEY of 800.00 dollars that I cash out from the Golden One bank to pay bills, everything was return except the 800.00, at least they return all my credit cards, driver liscence, they just took lots of cash, that person was not a GOOD Samaritan, and NAPA CA. Supposedly a rich city, I was working at Napa State Hospital, having a coffee break.
viviendo los valores mexicanos kbron
What a wonderful young man!   Good job mom!
Lesbians.
What goes around comes around, sometimes, you get nearly $4.000.00 for the good deed If that's the kind of thing we did promoting the safe return of property, it'd simply be more profitable to do the _good thing_ instead of steal. This doesn't need saying, but, we need more people like him.
🙏 nice of that Young Man
Maybe if he just kept it he would have made more.
I did that in the 1990's and Refused a $40- reward it was just the right thing to do.
So sad is made to be about  Money U could just give him a reward Why film it
Good man. We’ll done and great parents.
There was nothing in there so he returned it lol
This kid did the right thing. He and the people that raised him deserves infinite blessings
Every once in a while we see humanity shine through. It's cool to be kind.
Aw, how sweet.
This makes me smile.. being a single dad to a 5 year old daughter I do everything in my power to show her that being kind, honest, polite, helpful and humble is the way we as ppl should be. This young man is a breath of fresh air from the bad we all hear and see anymore.👏🏻
Look at that fake face and you know she's from Commiefornia. lol
It shows his upbringing and his character Kudos to him in his parents
Something real fishy about this whole story.
👍🏼🙏🏼
This kid was raised right
Its cool and all and hes a good guy but why do people get praised  for doing a simple good deed? I dont wanna sound like a bum but is it that abnormal to return a purse to a lady that he gets 3k?!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
such a good guy
I did this when working at grocery store pushing carts. Returned wallets/purses. Then a random woman got my manager to get to me cause the girl wanted to talk to me since she lost her purse and thought I stole hers cause I was pushing carts. Never received anything like this
Hmmm.  There IS hope after all.
Ayo central cee
Boi looked like he did the snatching and only returned it because nothing worthwhile was in it.
GOD BLESS HIS MOM YOU SEE.
Bless him  ❤ if you’re brought up properly, even in the wildest of times, you never forget good manners, his mum must be so proud of her boy, and he definitely should get a reward 🥰
Raza said “here ya go” good job for that vato.
whats wrong with her face? XD
Instead of saying “we need more people like him”, BE LIKE HIM.
He should get to pull that sweet hair!
She kinda bad
God Bless Him & His Parents.
I can’t 😢😢
Illegals!
really nice she gave him a reward but obviously everyone should always return stuff like that.. just something about respect
good job!
He probably stole the purse in the first place and when there was no money inside decided to return it hoping for a reward.
TRUST IN GOD AND BUDDHA 🙏❤️
brilliant young man - respect
Good for this kid for doing the right thing. Props to these people for helping the kid out. Getting all your ID and bank cards and credit cards all back is so hard and is a pain in the ass. Money is nothing when it comes to getting that stuff back
He was hoping to land that caliente poon
God bless him
in this fkd up world normal things become oddly surprising
tbh the kid was prolly damn she looking nice when he saw her id and decided to return it in hope to getting sum
What a G
And i bet this kid gets juded by people for the way he dreses or because of his race i say it cus i dress the same bagy pants loose shirts and baseball caps and am latino so i have people looking at me funny all the time and i have never been arested for nothing or comited any crimes
Lots of amazing people in our world, but we pay more attention to the bad things.
Damn, they could have both rewarded me with some soul snatching 💦🍆🤤and I would've been all good, im just saying ..😱🤠
I remember during the Baltimore riots one woman saw her kid on TV (not really doing anything) and came out of her house and ran down the street after him (all on TV), grabbed him by the ear and drug him up the street. All it takes is a good parent. Just one is enough.
Shii aunt would’ve had to give me that number 😂
She looked disappointed finding out he was 17
Thats why lets not judge the book by its cover. 🤫
Bout time y’all report something positive.
So happy that this young man did the right thing.
I once lost my purse with everything inside I.d medical cards social and  a little over a thousand dollars inside cause I just gotten my paycheck cashed which my not be much to some ppl but to me it was.  I was overwhelmed with having to get a replacement birth certificate since I was not born in this state anyways thank goodness a wonderful man found my purse and drove it to my home. I wasn't there at the time my than boyfriend now husband was there and he waited there till I came to put it in my hand. I tried to give him an reward but he would not take it. So if I ever come across someone belonging I would for sure return it because I felt lost when I lost my purse and that's not a good feeling...
God bless him🙌
What a sweetheart, I love genuine people so much❤️
Pretty sure all he wanted was some good heads
W KID
IF I found 100 dollar then I keep it but if I found more then 1000 then I return it to the owner.
I wish we have more of the young man . he did right thing and he should be proud of him . even his parents
Bro could have stolen that money in the purse and could have had like $50 more and would have then been a petty criminal, but instead he returned it and now got rewarded tenfold and is freely acknolwedged as a good doer and positive asset to our society. It payes off to do the right thing, and this is the gleeming example of why.
We need more people like him in this world
Se llama honor, cuando haces lo correcto cuando nadie te está viendo
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Salute you ❤ what an absolute star 🌟
I've saved a child from drowning on 2 different occasions. I never got any props nor did I want any.
Green purse didn't fit dudes ensemble.
Good man God bless him and watch over him 🙏
GTA 5 be like
Too bad basic honesty and decency has to be reported as some extraordinary event.
and he’s fine gaddamn
I've returned a few wallets and purses.. One time one of the wallets was filled with money.. I didn't even count it.. Looked at the liscense returned it and didn't even get a thank you...
She's annoying
Bet they set it up
Expectation: Video. Reality: Thats my purse! I dont know you!
He went back later that night and did a home invasion
The way he dressed and look is unexpected for others to view, Don't judge the book by it's Cover for real.
That is a good young man there. There is hope!
And people still questioning the power of La Chancla. Well done Young One !
yea that aint gonna be me i funna jack everything in that shiii then prolly return it
Bro I remember one time I found 20 dollars at school and gave it the teacher hoping to get called the next day for gator award and never got a thing. I’m pretty sure the teacher pocketed it.
not gonna lie this teenager putting some of yall adults to shame this is how anyone should be polite, well mannered, and responsible
In GTA5 I just give it back to them so I did a good deed and then kill them for full price.
Goddam if she looks like dat, Yk I’m gone be there too, might get sumn else in reward 😅
Adrian is a true man aged 17 <3
Great guy unreal I couldn’t do that I probably would of kept the handbag 👜 😂❤
Good man!
Good man
Good for you kid
God bless this young man who was raised right
Yea right Looks related to the girl on the right.
I've done this mission in gta before too respect. +200RP
i would have done the same
Once i found like 500$ from my uncle who visited our house in the yard he Lost his wallet, i returned him all the stuff and money and he gave me 100$ for being honest, i was like 7 years old My parents raised me like that, since then the feeling of doing good actions it's the Best because  the world needs honest people and help each other
I'm surprised she didn't sue him
he definetly returned it because he knew he would get a reward
A real man’s man well done.
It's awesome because he was just looking for some good karma, over $3k is a good amount of money, especially at 17!! And what his mother taught him is a good rule to live by for sure
I had crappy parenting and I still would have done this so idk if it is just parents.  I think my lack of parenting made me so angry at them that I cannot act like them.
Nice to see a good news story these days
Hmm what if he stole it and changed his mind he looks like a degenerate
Good for him !!!!
Ayyyy big ass dub for my edgar
what a gentleman 🥰
Thumbs up kid, good going
They all family
Mashaallah such a good kid May Allah God the Almighty reward him❤pls be kind and do good everyone alright cuz if no one sees you there’s One who always sees you Allah God the Almighty ❤
Every gangbanger got a good side
he’s so fine
A fine young man.
So nice to hear one good news out of so many bad news
It doesn't matter always what people look like. Goodness comes in many people.
Mane know he just wanted to go see shawty 😂😂🥲
Love that kid.
End result of good parenting.
Respect to bro
I love mi Raza 💙🙏🇲🇽
Need more good people in the world and more good people to raise their kids right as well 🙏🏻
he guaranteed seen how bad she was on her i.d and had to pull up to return it himself, thats why he came dripped out
Awesome. What a rare and dying mentality. As someone like him, I'm glad his good mentality got rewarded because often times us good people finish last.
God bless him.
Still good people out there 🙌🏼
I want to thank everyone . My son is my superstar. I haven't looked at this since this happened but it always brings a smile to know I have a great son. And it's must appreciated for all the great comments
He did it with a smile on his face too.
Congratulations to this young man’s mother for doing a good job raising him and congratulations to him for following his mother’s teachings!!
That's so awesome. What a great reward for him to start his life since he's almost an adult. Could get him a place, fix his car, pay for a semester of school, etc. Great job young man! 👏  Best wishes for your future.
I did things like this and I didn't get anything out of it and I Didn't really Care because I got by With my Life and I'm used to it, so, I've just been Doin' Whatever to Keep Movin' Forward, while Stayin' as a Composed & Methodical Person, that's a Warm Hearted Soul. Lol. 🤷‍♂️👍  Alright, Have a nice time. 🌷
He was tryna holler at ma
Amen 🙏 ❤
what a kid, good on him
Americans taking care of Americans. The way it should always be. Good on ya young man
Is it just me or he looks like faze rug?  Also he is handsome
Kudos to your parents. They taught you all the good manners and right conduct
Wow so many boys and even older man could learn from this kid and you know who I give it credit to his mother the way he was brought up you don’t just learned that you’re taught those kinds of manners and I’ve always told my boys please and thank you they go along way so kudos to the mom for raising such a great young man

They should give him some pussy for that
Good upbringing
Nice kid 😉

The start of a fine young man!!
A fine upstanding young man!  I wish 🙏  that all young people would follow his example and always do what's right!  👏👏
Amazing young man! Hope my little brother grows up like him! ❤
Now over $19k
He looks like someone who would steal. But no, he’s a kind man. Never judge a book by its cover.
Just more proof that good parenting  and teaching your children respect still works, great story 👍
He just saw that ID picture and had to do the deed lol
Sick ass foo returns purse
❤❤❤❤
That was so nice of him and his mom raised him right
God Bless🙏🌟
You, young man, is what I hope my future grandson will be like. Your  kindness will come back to you ten fold. I am proud of you and your parents. Bless you 😃
Aww, that's heart ♥ warming 😊
SOME GOOD PEOPLE AROUND! Unfortunately, it is more rare than not!

It's the right thing to do, no doubt about it, having a good heart, outweights any amount of Money
Good human 👍👍
Karma
🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍 Great Job done on both sides🥰🥰🥰💯💯💯
Sweet baby
Thank GOD for good men.
how she forgot to take a purse? I always do the same as he did (I am from Europe) but still happy other people do the same :-)
I'll tell a story here.  It is true.  A teen learning to drive with her Dad. Knocks over a Harley at a Bikie bar. Father makes her go inside & confess, give up license & insurance details.  She went inside,  finding the biggest brute you could find in the bar. He walked out with the girl,  much respect as it takes " Balls "  as he put it, to admit this kind of thing in a Bar.  So moving on,  months later.  The Girl is in serious trouble looking like a rape about to happen.  When who thundered around the corner,  see's shes in trouble.   Pulls up kicks the stand out,  says  .  Oi'  what the fk you c'nts want with my women ???   C'mon get on girl..  she rides off with him.  Ok so now where we going ??  To yours where do you live.  Of course Father is alarmed seeing his princess rock up on a Harley.  Dad,  dont stress he saved me,  do  you remember teaching me lessons & i hit that bike ??  This is the guy..   Anyway the Bikie thanked them for the details, got his bike fixed & shook hands in respect of the family.
A student in a high school accidentally scored high marks on a test because of teacher's miscalculation. She went back to him and said she deserves less. He corrected himself and later added marks for honesty in her final grade. Her story and the teacher got popular in school.
GOOD JOB BOY
Great things going to happen for the good young man who turned in purse and same for the lady who gave him 3k
Good Job Mom and Dad
Nice job young man! Seriously
His parents have morals not a lot of young have it nowadays this is coming from a 23 year old man that got raised by his grandma I’m glad I got taught morals and to do the right thing my grandma would say the same thing always do the right thing even when no one is watching
Wow that is amazing 👏
Good thing it wasn’t a black person who found the purse or else the lady would’ve never gotten it back!
Good job 👍👌👍👏
🙏🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Bless him*
What a great young man, his parents raised him right 😃
Good job brav0👏👏👏
Good boy
Not a lot of people would do this, he’s very honest.
Need more of these videos
Dang I bet he cried of happiness
An example of what's right.  I've returned 3 lost wallets in my life including 1 literally the same week mine fell out of my pocket getting out of my car.  It was never returned.  What a pain in the butt with credit cards, driver's license etc.
Good kid, faith in humanity restored
Alomejor la robó para regresarla y que hicieran un video
Tear jerking,  heart felt, impressive,  & an assurance that there is still hope in humanity!  And that kindness still exists!  Very proud of & impressed with this youngman 🙏
I'm sooo proud of him and his parents!!!!  Very proud of the women who received the lost purse for giving him a reward. Bravo!!!
He stole it himself
Awesome teen. Bravo!! 👏👏👏👏
I respect him!
It’s always the homies 😎🤝🏽
Good man didn’t look like he would don’t judge a book by its cover
Not everyone in the world is a punk. At my old job, i picked up a $100 bill off the ground, told my manager, he said you can ask around but we have 250 employees in the building or just keep it and call it a day. I walked around for a bit until I seen a lady freaking out, dumping out her purse, crying on the floor. I said what's wrong? She said i lost $100, it must've fell out of my purse or something. I told her i found it over there and she gave me the biggest hug said she was so grateful i didn't take it because that was toward her rent! Momma raised me right too.  if it aint mine, it dont belong to me. Good job youngsta
❤❤❤
FAITH IN HUMANITY RESTORED
This kid is awesome 👏
Nice, rare kid
I lost my wallet a few months ago while leaving work.... they went to Raising Canes, got some gas, and got a few hundred dollars in cash.
I believe that too. Honesty is the best policy.
The main question is did these ladies even give him the money or pocket themselves with it.
Another good samaritan
It's rare these days to see someone do the right thing (awesome ).
That's what's up!!!!   Gonna live a long time young man and will receive 🙏🏿 many blessings if you continue to carry yourself in such a manner!!!
I'm I the only one who's focusing more on how cute he is argh I've fallen gor him . ❤️
This what I needed after the night I had
Somebody should offer this kid a scholar ship to the University of his choice.  He deserves it.
Great young man and it all starts at home. His parents should be really proud of him and themselves for bringing him up right. The main stream media will never show this because it does not fit their narrative.  God bless the family.
“Always do the right thing, even when no one is watching.” That's called Integrity!
Plssssssss someone find him for me🥹🥹🥹 for research
3k??!!!!! Nah someone lose their purse rq
How the hell do you forget your purse in a shopping cart
I wish him and his family the very best.
Good job bro.🤙🏾👍🏽👌🏽🤟🏽✋🏽👊🏽🙏🏽🙋🏽‍♂️😊😎.
yeah doing the right thing is good to do  and it was good that return it
That's so great!!! What a honest man😁🙏🏾
God's sent
👍👍👍⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Why he kinda cute tho
Let’s not forget - kudos to the owner who went out of her way to find and reward him.
I will tell anyone willing to listen. You will ALWAYS go further in life if you do the right thing. I have learned this 30+ years ago, and in my experience (both good and bad)….it’s true.
Years ago I was by a homeless shelter getting gas. Right as I was leaving a homeless woman started to flag me down. At first I thought she was going to ask for lineup instead she was holding my wallet (full of cash) that fell to the ground. I gave her a hundred bucks.  At first she refused to take it so I just set it next to her and drove away.
He has wonderful parents...someone gave their heart and soul to him...he's just paying it forward...what an awesome son!
He returned it because he saw the picture ID.
Glad he can buy a phone so he can learn how to properly wear the belt around his waist😂
Good fella
a great example for new generation, keep it up kid!
Incredible! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
This brought tears. I am so happy there is beautiful young men out there doing the rite thing. God bless him always
I am touch, we have good people here
This young Man is on the right path all because he remembers his Moms voice ❤️ Always do the right thing 🏆🏆🏆🏆 that’s a Champion!
isn’t he a minor? now his face and full name is out there. and people know he has money now. maybe it would’ve been safer to blur his face and only say his first name
Good job young man.  You deserve the reward.  Your mother is a great woman.  You didn't expect anything in return just to do the right thing and you were rewarded.  Keep it up and pass it on.
Too bad his mommy didn't teach him to not dress like a street thug.
plot twist
Need more like him in the world again.
Amazing story
I love that he did this. I'm also saddened by how praised it is. Not because he doesn't deserve it but because it's no longer common behavior. It's praised so much because people don't normally go out of their way to do the right thing anymore and that's just sad.
Awe this made me tear up.. such a good kid 👏 judos to his mommy for raising a good one. Also kudos to the ladies for finding him nd rewarding him. Such a nice story finally to watch.
Plot twist:   He stole the purse.
That is a good teen age and you deserve it my man
Good job young man!!!
What a sweet kid and well done to his mom, wow!
Listen to your parents!!!!❤
Women. This is what we all deserve in a man.
Oh thank goodness it was not a Karen. If it was I am sure she would of called the Cops on him.
If the parents taught their children the right things, it will be more likely that they will grow walking the right path. 🏆
little bro gots them cougers heated for him now good job broski
❤❤❤👏
the world needs more people like him but 3K$ is unnecessary. 10$ was enough. the puse had maybe a credit card and a 100$ bill.
I can’t believe how many people took the go fund me serious   “Fine young man raised by his parents right”???😂
Glad to share the same last name as that young men
I drove a half hour to give someone’s wallet back once that I found and he just took it and slammed the door in my face without even a word ☹️
It's a shame that his action is the exception and not the rule.  The good news is.....with the reward money, he can buy a belt to hold his britches up.
cholo stance, nice kid thats wassup 📿
Definitely raised right ,and can go to bed with a clear conscience of knowing did the right thing!!! BRAVO,to parents!!!!
I would too because I got a good paycheck let someone that’s struggling hard find that purse they gonna take all the money then pawn the purse
Congratulations young boy. You have a great future in life. 😊
One in a million! 👍
I lost my passport last night in a really busy party like city where everyone is basically drunk or high. Some random Spanish guy that found it found me on Facebook and messaged me to come get it as he found it at 3am , what a legend.
GOD. BLESSING.  HIM
I’m proud of him.
All moms wish to raise their kids this way
Bro seen the id picture and came to shoot his shot 😂
Now that's how you raise your children instill positivity and greatness in them at a young age...😍
Late to the party. But this made me feel good after a horrible day. My hope is more young people hear about this and it inspires them to make the right call, regardless of their upbringing ❤
I remember when I worked at the mall, I found a wallet in the bathroom stall. It had at least $1000 in it, ALL hundreds because the money was literally sticking out of the wallet it was so much. I grabbed the wallet to see if I could find the woman who was just in the bathroom and luckily she came 😂back asking if anyone saw a wallet. I gave it to her and she was in pure utter shock that it was returned with nothing missing. She didn’t even say thank you 😂
wait?!? She didn't give him ANYTHING from the gecko??? Oh wooow. I would've been embarrassed if I didn't give anything when he'd been so kind to drive all the way out to me
That’s wonderful!!
What a good deed he did from his heart.  And what a blessing appreciation he received in return to make him feel  the importance of being honest and respectful… good job to his Mom for bringing up a truthful gentleman…and to him for following his Mom  trustful lesson😊
The gofundme is almost up to $20k now. This is so cool.
I don’t know you but you have great character keep passing on the good vibes ❤️
Daaaang, thats whats up
thats awesome
This is the definition of Kindness , no bull shyt
I love honest people
yooo that’s my doorbell sound too
My boy is about to get a honda civic for 2500
Amazing
INTEGRITY
we need more people like him: 👎   I will try to be more like him : 👍🏻
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 may JESUS keep blessing angels like this
I think he’s nice, but I also think he thought the aunt was hot lol 😅
You sweet honest young man, love to you and thank you so much for being a good part of this world we're living in.
why she didnt let him smash
Plot twist if it was a bum
Good man, what a great story 😊
SEE NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER   GOOD JOB YOUNG MAN
Good man 👍
Wow

That look like Lil Moco
They raise  him up right proud  👏
Awe 💕
What a fabulous young man.
Doing the Good Lord's work is ALWAYS a great thing. It goes a long long way with God. Good for this kid!
We need more honest & loyal people like that in the world 💯💯💯 big ups for you and doing the right thing
My respects to him 👏🏼👏🏼
The kid is a real man before becoming an adult🙂
& HE FINE AS A MF
Integrity. That's awesome.
sucks losing ur ids. all i would want is my ids back. the kid did a good thing n deserved all the gifts
He has women in his family that he loves dearly and thought of them when he seen a lost purse.
i love this🫶🏾
Bro deserves atleast 2 blowies and a tuggie from her
bro was tryna hit
I would’ve done the same thing, where my 4 thousand dollars at?
Such a great boy
What an amazing young man! His mama taught him right. Thank you to everyone that rewarded his good deed
it’s illegal to not update your address after moving.
Moral of the story. RAISE YOUR SONS RIGHT
Also it's a scam 😂
20 bucks really u could have lost everything
Haven’t seen anyone say this but if I saw that smoking stone cold fox’s ID in that purse I’d personally take it back too. And the accent? Boy I might have put some money in her purse 😂
He saw that driver’s license and shot his shot 😘😅
that’s my brother😭😭
He not gangster
Plotwist he stole the purse before
broo, a good person and he’s fine? double W fs, he was raised right and i hope he helps many more ppl and gets amazing rewards 🫶
hes fine as hell
Good deeds really get you somewhere…. Not just about getting rewarded. You should do the right thing in general. Nice to see 😊😇
Jesus is coming back to earth very soon to collect souls who believed in Jesus please believe in jesus
Good dude
Ngl if I was him I wouldn't even take that money.
Not going to lie, the most I would have done in that situation is hand it to management at the store where I found it. The fact that he went out of his way to hand deliver it back to the owner is incredible what a great kid 🥲
way to go young man.....
So sad when this simple act is seen a something exceptional. Shows the world we live in😢😢😢
watching this made me happy cry
Gives you hope fair play young man
Proud of you lil bro 💪🏽
Gif bless him
awe what a sweetheart
Young adult raised right. God bless
Stupid ladies get off your phones... Geesi!!
A pretty girl in my arms,that CARES about me and LOVES me is what i want/need/deserve.I dont deserve heartless girls telling me how ugly I am this and that when its not my fault,little by little the anger  built up and   now im dealing with bullies/haters. Im a guy that does NOT tolerate evil and unfair people ,im all  for good,love,care,hugs,cuddling. :).
Idiot 🤦🏻
HE FINE
He sounds spiritual, and helpful. 🙏
Makes my heart smile
Unbelievable
I wonder what would happen if you black doing that
Well I did something like what he did for a person n didn't even get a thank you😭😭
The go fund me was “fine young man” 💀💀💀
They celebrating this nice act.. Which should be a normal and casual one.. Imagine what type of society is this.. They have a long way toward humanity and i don't think they will reach it
This kid was raised  great, we need more people like this.
Notice how he also looks like the type of guy a Karen would assume was a sketchy dude. Shows that you should never really judge a book by a cover
Woulda settled for a 3 some 😀
Do the right thing even when no one is watching, kid has god integrity.
He stole it then returned it 😭
This is beautiful 🙏🏽 amazing young man I hope people in his community encourage this behavior and help him any way they can to keep him on this track 🙏🏽
That’s how latina moms raise kids representing the homie Adrian
Reinstilling faith in our youth.
Record yourself doing 'the right thing' and be a greta thunberg or just do it and be a boyan slate🙏🏽
We all know why he did that cmon guys 🤣
Wow and he’s  brown that’s probably not normal
I love positive news. Thank you
lost my wallet lastnight and I'm praying someone good like this finds it! Terrible feeling. Good on this young man!
Thank god the cops weren't driving by he could've easily ended up in the morgue.
God bless
👌
Hoped my boy got the real bag 👀👀 Them were sum hotties
Botox Aunt
Need more like him. Good job man.
Good to know people like you still exist in this world. Thank you!
It's a normal thing in Japan
Let’s b honest homie was just trynna hit
I usually skip this part
If you do something nice at the end you will always get rewarded
that's so sweet :)
Yo he seen her ID and was like "dayuuumm" lmfaoo. Already knowin.
Fake
Hell yes! Good on him, and good on the owner for rewarding him.
look at what a simple thing can do!
We all know bro just wanted to smash
Kid looks like Lamar from gta5
He was lucky not to be checked by the police because they would accuse him of stealing it!
This is the 1% there is no hope
Oooo love him
Good ladd  👍😎    🇦🇺
Rewarding him is a very good reaction for his kind deed actions, he might not have done it for the money, but at least it is a good message to send "if you do good, good will come back you".
you drop this king👑
Hes so fine
What's disgusting about this story is what about those of us who do hundreds of deeds, infinitely more powerful than this and only get disrespect...A guy does something of no comparison to me and gets thousands of dollars..smfh. You turned him into a mercenary...If he was a good person, he would have turned the money away.
My boy seen that id pic and was tryna get some cheeks 😆😆
What a wonderful man!
He wanted to HIT IT
He wanted the girl
This is the kind of son I want oh my goodness 😢❤❤❤
You know he was trynna smash bro pulled up with the ice and all loll
17M people: Interesting
Maybe he was hopping to have a dance with that Latina 😹
andddd he’s fine
They got almost 20k now😮
do good get good 🙌
She needs to lay off the botox 😆
Nice job mom power to you
Bro looks chill af
I always go out of my way to get people lost belongings back and I never steal. Good karma has really looked out for me!!!
Nah, he saw that girl and thought he might get lucky. Instead, he got paid. I guess that's a win too.
Awsome work my man ,God knowz what you did and why .
God bless
Good dude!
I did this too... I didn't get the idea of stealing it, always gave back, I never expected a thing from it... but now I'm older, realising how messed up this world is, I can't guaranteed this any more lol. Lots of young people have good mind, but when they get older, it may get worse...
His go fund me has even more now !
This is awesome.
When I was in elementary school I found my teacher wallet and she promised to buy me ice cream all that school year and if I’m not mistaking, she did! Good deed guy!
Good kid
W young man
This young man was very kind and responsible
I once returned 10 Million Dollars. All I got was a handshake.
This world need more people like you brother God bless you
When you're cool and kind at the same time
inside edition couldnt care less about this its all about the money for them
W
Bro got 3k for returning a purse if that isn’t the biggest finesse idk what is
Nice
Turns out he took the purse and the money inside then collected the reward lol
Nah bro the girl on the right is kinda
He's well mannered
Nice
What a beautiful young man..;( this as a Mother of a 24 year old and 14 year old makes me 😊
This is great I hope other kids learn from this young man
Wow, as of today that go fund me has surpassed $19k! Nice job man
lol they had to open a GoFundMe for him to make sure no $ come from their pocket
Bro deserves the drip 👌🏾
Let me find somebody purse
Imagine he robbed it then realized I'll pretend so I get a reward 👀
✊🏽💪🏽
He seen her ID, and said to him self’ I know for a fact that if I return this she would give me some ( guess what) and a reward 😅😅😅😅😅!!!!!!
Having a good sense of morality is whats needed and required to be human. This is a normal human behavior, and definitely a true definition of good samaritan. I’ve done stuff like this myself before, and watching this gave me hope theres more people like me out there.  If I see this kid, I’d be honored to shake his hand for his noble deeds. We need more people like him, and I do wish I get to meet people like him around my area.
if just half the people on earth had this mentality this place would be so much better
Bro must of got mad slops on top as well
Why do we hear about these deeds or good People but never encountered them lol?
This act is the definition of integrity. Doing the right thing when no one is watching. Good job man!🤙🏻
did yall really round down 3785 to 3K
she left her purse in the shopping cart bro 🤣
Did not expected it from a black kid with tattoos and hip hop outfit.
W man. He has a bright future ahead
Great job young man . ty mom . 🌹
It says so much more about society that everyone is praising him for doing something that should be normal.
Good young man right there.
I bring every purse back from now 4 k eeasy money go fund ne
Real one!
Who’s cutting onions? 🙏🏽🥲😍🥰❤️❤️❤️😇🙌🏽
Salute!
Good deeds pay off… If he wasn’t honorable, he prolly could have hawked the purse for $20….
bet he got reward with vaginas too
i want him really bad.
he prob stole it
My man just wanted some bread
We need more people like this in our world. Such a kind hearted human being.
That’s the exact morals I try to instill in them no matter what do the right thing.
J.I a good dude man 😂😂
He saw the picture on the ID and knew he had to slide 🤣 he didn’t gaf about doing the right thing
I left my wallet in a basket at Walmart parking lot. I went down the road and went through and drive through before realizing I didn’t have my wallet. I zoomed back. It wasn’t in the basket. I went to customer service and fortunately someone turned it in. It had everything still in there. I was so grateful.
The kinda son you'd want ya daughter to bring home 👍
They started a funding page for $1000 while they're living in a California house. He's returning your bag. They should reward him whatever they have not ask public for charity
Should be titled and *gets a go fund me page?*
Don't judge a book...
salute to this young man
As a younger kid than I am now I would've been confused on why so much money I'd be like isn't a 1000 enough? But after what I've seen on the internet I realize just how rare this is
𝑾𝒐𝒘𝒘𝒘𝒘𝒘𝒘
💜💜💜💜
Bravo young man! I’m sure you made your mom very proud ❤
He is a good guy or maybe an evil genius who stole the purse and return it to the owner taking advantage of certain humanity loop holes
Ya and any cop would be quick to profile this is y u don't judge a book by its cover. Look at the famous serial killers Ted bundy for example. Ddnt look crazy at all. But we all know how that ended
Is he single lololol
because its doing the right thing like a lot of people should do
Good on the young bloke! I am ashamed to say i would have judged a book by its cover.
I’d bring it back too. Look at those cougars
That's the definition of INTEGRITY : That young man was raised right and now he and his mom (super proud mommy moment) get to enjoy well deserved police honor. I pray for many more blessings to them.
he fine asfff
Good dude
it’s funny how the gofunme’s title was “fine” young man”
If he didn't drive an audi instead a bike and didn't have much money that purse would have not been returned
Baddass no camaras thats right
I would want a date with the mom !!!
Big loss to the guy if the bag had more than 3k in it
This is what you call unspoken rizz
It's Morals
Good young man respect to him.
Adrian your a good kid. Keep up the good energy god will always reward you with blessings
Beast 💪
good honest man.
Love this 👊🏻💯♥️I would of done the same thing
Cool. Good to see they found a great way to reward him and give others the chance to add their support. Nothing wrong with finding out dozens of people want to reward you for a decision you made.
Dude with gangster appearance but with angel heart...never judge a book by it cover
So sad that this made the news this is what everyone sould do shame thay don't.
This wouldn’t even make news in Australia, it’s just what we do.
Homie checked the license and say she was bad and wanted to stop by
literally gta5
One good deed in California? That’s like throwing a peanut in the ocean. California is completely hopeless.
Sadly the younger generation get a bad wrap... it's great to see posts like this. They aren't as uncommon as you think 🥰 what a fantastic young man!!
He knew what he was doing😭🤣🤣🤣
Sad times that this "good Deed" makes news headlines. in America..... In Japan, you have an extremely high  chance of receiving your lost  wallet or purse back  intact with cash. There they respect  other's property and I was initially surprised to see expensive electric cycles,  beautiful plants in ceramic pots  etc; all outside homes beside sidewalks.. In a lot of countries they would be gone in minutes! I saw this in many Japanese cities and towns.
He did the right thing, but the way he did it was dangerous. He's a Latino male holding someone's purse ringing their doorbell at night. In a different neighborhood he may have been met with gunfire. Crazy folks in this country. Proceed with caution and trust NO ONE.
WOW WHAT A WONDERFUL YOUNG MAN,May God bless you always!💙😘🙏
Parents did a good job raising this kid. Good for this young man! 🤘
This is precisely why you don’t judge a book by its cover
He just thought she was leng
The saints need to get rid of jameis Winston
What a beautiful soul! Two great reasons. My son’s sensei said the same thing to my son’s class when he was little and it stuck. ❤
Damn what a good dude, not a lot of people in general would go out of their way to return someone’s belongings. And in the end he got rewarded which was deserved!
Much love for this story 💗
goofundme is at 20k now!!!!
Well Done Young Man
Good man! Keep that up dude!
A great guy  🥰👏
meanwhile other teens dancing like whatever tf in TikTok idk i don't use TikTok
Is she Mr Beast’s mother?
This will NEVER happen in Memphis!
Id return it for a date with melina.
Love it
You sorry panzies put this on to try and look good for the cameras now, but ive lived my entire life growing up doing the right thing and got nothing but lies and deceit from you for the wage of more of that sweet sweet money. I wanna see the treasury before i consider this one or has it all gone crypto self generated yet?
Damn, almost 4K! I hope this inspires other kids/teens to do the right thing.
The lord will bless him!
doing a good deed is news worthy nowadays.
Bro saw how cute she was so he returned it🤣
Golden child. Well done 👍…
Bless the man
the most impressive thing is that he is black,  Adrian gj
Hopefully people would keep doing the right thing for the right thing, not because they think they'll get a reward if they did :\
Yeah but ultimately, he returned it in hopes that he would get some booty
Good to know there's still some good people in this world.
Faith in humanity restored
That's a great thing to do! I hope other people will follow things (: What comes around, goes around! ❤️
Let that be Florida State your missing purse 👛 is gone forever because floooka state is old homeless hobos carnival folks.
Certain"people" would have kept it.
Good for him maybe he could buy his first car with that go fund me money he is a genuine person
bruh wanted some cheeks 🤣🤣
When kids have been raised right ❤️❤️❤️
He looks like a young Nate Diaz
He saw the pic and thought damnnnnn I'ma tap this door
Kid said “I was raised by my parents to always do the right thing”  Woman comments “that was nice”  😒LOL
Que Lindo.God bless him!
$nitch
Wow!! That good, n yes there a FEW GOOD HEARTS OUT THERE!!!. I know he's blessed....✊👏💯👍
She looks like azzyland
Respect 🙏🏽
Love this
W kid
Don't judge a book by it's cover.
❤️
That's a one and a million circumstance to happen .
God Bless his Mother for instilling in this young man , Love they Neighbour as thyself, God Bless his Life .
nice people: (being nice)  other people: „thATs Not mY problem
My husband lost his wallet a few months ago and was devastated. Fortunately, a couple found his wallet and went out of their way to bring it to the address listed on his ID. Yes, there is still good people out there. It’s a good habit to find gratitude and hope in the smallest things, and this goes out to those who always have something negative to say…
Oh wow…
Good parenting 👌🏻
That’s a good boy!! Kudos to his mama for raising him right!!
Wow!!! Absolutely amazing. Hard to believe in this desperate day, and age. Glad he was rewarded for his good deed, as he does not appear to be wealthy, and probably could really use the money, like most of us.
Love this story ❤️
I returned a guys wallet one time, it had almost 1,000$ in it. Cheap bastard didn't even say thank you.
Integrity.
Mission Passed! Respect +++ Honor ++++ Fame ++
See guys you can have cool chains without being a bad person 👍
Load of ballacks
I wish all teenagers were this friendly.
Legends among us....that kid is going places
bro could’ve punched ez 10k wit da cards🤧
I hope you people that aren't like this realize how EMBARRASSING it is to even be near you or even to be you .. you're a disgrace to all kinds .
what a good kid
Adrian Rodriguez that’s my first and last name
the gofundme has reached $19,171
Man that is surprising he did that especially being so young raised right  his mom and dad should be proud of him
Wow!!!
Good boy 💞
Great story Wonderful young man!!!
What a good guy, always nice to see someone doing the right thing we need more guys like him
WOW‼️💯👉👑
So... Thats how a giga chad looks irl
Youngsters need to take notes 📝  from this young man.
His parents should be so proud.
This is what you call looking out for your own fr!
He wanted to meet the lady after checking the ID cause he thought she was hot. 🤷🏽‍♂️
Now all he has to do is stop dressing like a wanna be thug and he'll be good to go.
she had too
When you keep on doing the right things, good things will definitely come.
So inspiring ..... Great job kid  👍
love
everything happend for a reason, why she didnt update her adress, forgetting the handbag, he found it, he brought you the bag…universum is incredible
I did so much stuff like this but I never got anything in return. God rewards those he choose
Good job kid.
We still have sum good youngsters left thats good 👍🏿💯
Bro was looking so gangstar
It's sad that doing the right thing has become newsworthy.
Parenting done right. Props to the young man
What a great young man and what must be a great mother this put a smile on my face
❤️❤️❤️
His mom told him to always do the right thing I was raised by a single mother my mother raised four kids by herself and my mother instilled the same believe in me that young man has a wonderful mother and she should be proud of her kid God bless you buddy
I would of returned it just for a reward
God Bless this young man and may others learn from this experience of doing the right thing.
Thats right baby! Shout out to him.
Good mother and good kid!!! This just restored my faith in humanity 🫶🏻
JESSE GO GIVE THE Purse BACK JESSE!
One kid does something good and all the sudden there is hope for the generation. One good kid out of 10,000 worthless ones. Doesn't mean there is hope. That's like one black man who isn't a criminal. That's one out of 1000. Doesn't make a difference.
saluteee
OUTSTANDING Young MAN.
Hell yeah Adrian!
idk man but this thing shouldn't be a "right thing", it's just sad, this should be a very normal thing to do...
He proly had to take a piece of gum
Come up to the spot looking exrra fly
What a decent lad!
God still sends angels in all forms and ways on both sides still. His sibblings taught him well.
There is hope!
I wish my future son could be like him
one i pick up purse and returned it. dude said thanks  and walked away immediately.
The definition of integrity is to do the right thing even when no one else will know about it.
God is good Amen 🙏
I handed a purse in to the police aged 18...got 2 policemen turn up at my house to accuse me of taking the cash out 1st????????   So this doesnt always end "well"
This is a first for me... I thought women never lose there purse lul
👍👍👍👍👍👍🇳🇱👍👍👍🤩🙏
I found a wallet at a hockey game once. I called the only number in the wallet and it was her sister. I had it back to them the very next day.
That FOO was raised right
Great human being
we ALL know why he returned it.He probably just saw her ID and thought maybe he'd get some booty...    Jk  Good job kid
Adrian your Good Deed brought tears to my eyes. Wonderful video, great young man.
Deserved
Good job kid. He was raised by good parents or grandparents.
If only everyone in the world was like this kid!
I was traveling through Ohio, I found a wallet in the bathroom, social security card and everything, I drove 20 minutes out of the way to return the wallet, where's my inside edition?
Wow, that's great to see some good people still out there
The reason why I'd be scared to bring it back, and would choose to leave it alone instead, is because what if someone found it before you, took all the valuable stuff and you went to return it? The people would assume you stole what's missing.   Great kid, though. More people should be like him.
Sad people get rewarded for just doing the right thing. God has the real reward and punishment for those who don’t.
I think homie was trying to smash.
Now that's a cool dude
A gal I worked with in 1987, her boyfriend lost his wallet in LA and some good Samaritan mailed it back to him with all his money inside. This kid that did this for this gal he is God's Angel ❤️
May God bless this remarkable young man! 🙏 Amen. Yes, there still is hope for this world..
society has stooped so low that a simple deed like returning something went viral
We need more people like him
Thanks...i needed to see something good and positive
Good for him
My man!!! 👌
Great things will come to this young man. God bless.
this man deserves everything in the world
“There’s hope for out younger generation!” You mean the generation that you raised?
recommended wtf
What a man!
God works miracles
Gg bro
Solid parenting !
Nah he stole it in the first place. Then he returned it😂
worlds greatest finesse
Raised right!
Great kid, credit to his parents.
how tf is he 17 with tattoos?
Bless your heart young man! ♥️♥️♥️
Thank you for covering a positive story. The world is mostly positive. We need to hear more happy stories.
Good young man.
The fact that this is regarded as a "special act" is not okay..  But yeah given our society circumstance, it a great act
A trustworthy young man 🙏❤️🇺🇸😊
👍😊
Damn no wonder he pulled up she bad asl
Need more of this.
Lil Maru
at the time of this comment its already past $19,000 :)
Love this
Bro was trying to smash 1000%
You know, i would’ve just said to give it to the store and let them handle it, but then he wouldn’t have gotten $3000 dollars lol
I would do the same thing 100% I had someone leave 15 grand in my trunk months ago I didn’t touch a dime of it nor did it even cross my mind
Thats what ive doin since :) Even im Zero in Life
When this type of activity becomes amazing you know Society is totally devolving somebody doing the right thing that makes the news what the hell is happening
Bro checked the purse and made sure it didn’t have more than 3k in it
i find this stupid. a teen did the right thing and returned a lost item, but 3k? thats an absurd amount of money for just returning a bag. instead of paying for a teen who obviously is fortunate, they should be donating to people in need who can hardly get food on the table.
Parents do important part too !
Bro finessing the system
Great!!!
funny thing is that by his appearance we has probably been judged unfairly a lot of times lol
They both fine 🤤
Really nice to see this.  Good kid.
Mama raised him right. Good Job mom
Kid got his head on right
Nice job my boi… 👍🏽👍🏽
And he,ll make a great parent 1 day..Well done young man..👏👏
Bless that young man.
Coulda been 3k and a 3sum
It made my day even tho it’s got nothing to do with me. In Japan this kind of incident is pretty common. My brother lost his wallet in a train but someone brought it to his high school. The other day, I accidentally transferred 300$ to a random guy (I know I’m stupid) but he transferred it back to me. Honestly I was quite hopeful that the money would come back.
That’s troublekidd52
We more of this in the news instead of the constant bombardment of doom and gloom. Good for that young man doing the right thing.
I love this!!! Thank you so much for posting.
That lip injection business is booming
Don't look into a crowd of faces and assume they're people, look into a crowd of people and assume they have faces.
In gta they let you keep like 5% of the money, so only return it if it’s an asset like a car, because the npc is more likely to give you stocks or send you a suit a few days later
He was hoping they reward would be them 😏
May God Bless you brother God sees and knows all Blessing 🙏.
Paying it forward* honest example of basic human decency. We need more stories like this.
This goes to show how easy it is too make up a story and get rich off 🤑🤑 it ohh yeah. 😀
👌
If he hasn't moved out already he's going to move out soon
That young man has integrity
SD all day
Good karma ❤
Homie saw that ID picture and tried to get lucky
For views
She looks like the kinda person to leave behind a stupid expensive purse.
SCORE ONE FOR THE GOOD GUYS
honestly, he doesnt even look like honest guy lel. you cant really judge people from look these days.
Hell yeah bro 💯
You Go Adrian!!
Real one
💪🏻...🔥파이팅
• 👏🏻 • 👏🏻 • 👏🏻 •
That made me cry… talking how his mama raised him..
Jajajaja el vato bio las mujeres y dijo: hoy toca sex
The time and cost of having to replace all your cards/id/ cash being lost, one of the most valued possessions that anyone could have that they would need on the daily. When it’s gone it’s stressful
Definitely can learn everything from this young man. Sadly he is one of a million
Living proof that people still raise good kids all is not lost...we all can make it if we try
Well that's cool But next time Dont leave ur purse in a shopping cart 🤔
Ok but he fine
🙏❤
Bro is fine 🤭
" We can stage anything these days "
but did he got Laid?
🥰🥺
Good job bud
am i the only one that wants to cry.. lmaooo cause he literally got $3000 for doin the right thing i always do the right thing it makes me feel good but unexpectedly receiving money i’d be so happy 😭
latin legend 🐐🖤🔥
Audi r8?
“do the right thing even when no ones watching” thats called integrity and this world needs more of it
This is the news I wanna see ❤️‍🔥🙏
Bless Him
I found a girls wallet with a lot of money in it, credit cards, IDs so I went out of my way to track her down. She came over picked it up and gave me 20 bucks lol
could be a nicely constructed scam...surely there was more than 3k that came in
This is the type of news I like watching
Omg what a sweetheart.  So happy he got rewarded.  God rewarded him because he did a good thing even when no one was watching because god is always watching ❤️
The go fund me is almost up to $20,000 ❤️
people should learn from this well raised well mannered kid 💁🏻‍♀️💯👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🥰 kindness goes a long way
That’s exactly what we should do this is beautiful!!!
He could have just handed it police. He didn't have to show up at her door.  "Do the right thing even when nobody's watching" though I guess it's good to have someone to appraise you for doing the right thing.
We need more 17 yr olds like this young man..
🙏
That's why you can never judge a book by it's cover. I bet you all thought that boy was a criminal until you realized he's just trying to survive in the situation he was dealt.
Hope I find the same purse, a purse or just anything. Im bouta return a lost paper clip and they better start a gofundme for that.
Unfortunately people too often do things because they’re hoping to get something out of it. Sometimes people just do things because it’s right, but…I do not know what this young man’s intentions truly were but he did the right thing and that’s the biggest factor so good on him
What an angel baby! I want to shake his moms hand!
Why did I cry so hard over this 😭❤️‍🩹 all too touching & heart-warming, I just can’t 🫠
What a wonderful man.
They should of let him smash
Lmao that gigantic glass of vino at 00:23
Good it was not a white or black cause they take anything as long as is something!!
Such a good kid Ben Simmons!
Good kid
I’m so happy to see this boy was not only taught integrity but lives it to. Wonder example of what everyone should aspire to be
karma returns even if it's good or bad what ever you do it definitely comes back to you ❤️.... raised well good lad ❤️
Respect to you you will have a good life with the values you have
Don’t judge a book by it’s cover!!  ✌️🤟
Do you guys remember that movie where the girl (chloe actress) brigns back a lost purse to a lady, which turns out to be a horror movie and tries to kill her, as soon as i saw this i thought of this lol
What a good kid. Mother must be proud!
Sad doing what's right is news
God bless him
He was hoping to get the cheeks as a reward. Lol
I like feel good stories as much as the next guy but Inside E got taken for a ride here… along with everyone who sent money. So planned, so scripted, so perfectly manufactured for them all to make some money out of thin air.
His parents did a great job raising this young man.
Many aren't rewarded.
Good parenting 🫀
Wow...great kid
What a good man!!! Don't see that enough!!
Damn I would return her purse also she’s a hot cougar
May God Bless this kid and his family.
Good guy.... God bless......
Good guy he deserves the praises we need more guys like this out there but watch if police saw him walking down the street he'd get roughed up and treated like a criminal. But look at how much of a pure hearted person he really is and that's something they'd never know ❤️💯
My manz got the 🍑 treatment..
Good job yong guys  I like he said  nobody watching you but god see you
Mr.Beast woulda gave him 10k smh.
good job Mom. proves that a good society starts from good parenting
Congrats to the young man and the woman that got her purse back.
I’m gonna start stealing purses and returning them
Staged
well done son!!
bro did a good deed and mfs think its so deep
Did he hit tho
God save the USA
Good job mom
It’s quite weird for me as a swiss person seeing civilized actions as returning someone‘s purse or helping someone up as being a wonderous deed in the USA..
This will become normal once again now you no longer have a kleptomaniac for a POTUS.🙏🏿
Simply amazing!
❤️❤️❤️
If this kid runs for president I would vote for him
I always take it back to when theres no money in there lol
And to think that by todays standards he probably gets looked at and assumed he’s a trouble maker by the way he’s dressed , tattoo , and race when in reality he’s a good kid .
Good job kiddo 🥰🥰
you can get tattoos at 17 in San Diego? 🧐
Maybe I should return this purse to the old lady I robbed?
Hype.  Actor
damn, both them girls baddies. they shoulda gave him some top. Yeah i said it! Judge me..
Hope the homie gets a car or small vacation from this. 👏
I'm sorry but it says a lot about the state of the world when such a simple deed, something that should be normal, gets in the news and is praised like an insane achievement
Wow 💐❤️👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
He was raised right
Mad props to the homie and his Jefitos for raising him right,  now let's buy him some suspenders.
This makes me happy!!
In a world where so much is wrong this young man has given me new faith in people. Perhaps there is hope for this world.
Good person 👍
This young man is going to do good things in this World. Vaya Con Dios  🙏
Meanwhile police looking at him like a gang member and drug addict 🤦
that kid is beautiful and respectful, his momma raising him right
I absolutely love this!
If I had been rewarded for doing the right thing when no one was watching  I would be rich.   Just saying
aww there's still good people out there 😊
As a former Marine we were taught Integrity. Integrity is doing the right thing when no one is watching. This was
Great job kid.   We need more kids like this.
Tbh I clicked on the video Bc this man looks fine
Good kid.
Aww that's so sweet 💕
Plot twist. Dude just seen some ID and figured "maybe If I return this purse I'll get some" so off the young man went.
My wife left her hand bag on a hook in a ladies room at Devils Tower Wyoming. Someone found it handed it in at the office. Nothing was missing from the bag all the cash, credit cards and her passport. We asked if the person left a name or any contact information,  they had not. That saved our vacation, and we still think about that kind person.
Much respect
He probably checked the drivers license and was like dang imma return this purse to this M-I-L-F
Its called integrity. Good on him
Our politicians could learn something from this young man and his mom!
Wow!
I once say a wallet with money, credit cards and California ID in a patking lot at target and returned to Target and the employee voiced the name on his speaker and the lady came to the counter. She was so surprised that I had returned it. She offered me $50 but I didn't accept. I felt great to have done the right thing.
Big deal this what you re supposed to do like, just like puffing up a father for actually being one
Such a good young man! 😍
Melina Marquez
I hope good employers hire him! He needs to share this to all the future jobs he applies for! To his parents, thank you for raising him with integrity.
That's what you're supposed to do??
Great kid
Shidd if that was me i would've been like BETTTT and took all that mfs money.  Finders keepers lmfao. Thats what you get for being dumb enough to leave your entire purse behind.
Nice
a fine young man
Done this before myself so what
That kid is rare as a unicorn now days. Honesty doesn't exist anymore
proof that mothers teach their boys right.
what’s his @ 😏
Good man!!!!
Amazing
So Refreshing of an Honest Young Man Prayers Of Blessings For Him
What a great kid.
So awesome
Look the kid did a good thing you can't deny that, But everyone is acting like hes cured cancer or something.  It is actually very scary that everyone is so surprised that someone did a nice thing.
What a lovely kid, his parents should be very proud of him. He did the right thing,  its nice to see youngsters doing good deeds. Unfortunately the few get the many a bad name. What a great reward he deserved it
uMMm.... I BET good $$$ that he was the 1 who stole it.... Lmaao
Let's ruin a totally disinterested gesture by throwing a lot of cash on it, cause remember to bend your knees in front of the dollar, the only god americans really ship
Cougars
he never returned a purse
With that 3000 dollars did he buy a belt to keep his pants on his hips ? Just asking
This proves god is working on ppl even when no one acknowledges it
How do we know media is not straight lying on this one?
He probably seen she looked good on that I.d
Bro think he in gta 💀💀
IK this is supposed to b a whole some video and stuff but the dude is kinda cute..
👏💪🙏😇
Plot twist: the 17 year old stole it. 🤫
the dono has 19k rn absolutely insanee
kys
lol its funny how a story like this counts as big... usa is a horrible place in this way
A verse in the Bible says “ Doing the right thing , when no one is watching” his mom taught him better
A feel good story…the world needs to hear more.
Fantastic young man👍🏿
Teenager: Hey ese you lost your bag foo
We need more people like this in the world
Need more news like this
How would we know if he actually got the money?
I just don’t like that we feel the need to reward good deeds… people shouldn’t expect rewards for doing what’s right is what I’m getting at
Plot twist: stole it and returned it back for good deeded
He definatly got they number 😂
The friend’s face when she threw her under the bus at :45 seconds hahahaha
I just wanna know how someone lost their whole purse, especially since it's bright green and it's not that small.
He prolly seen that ID photo and said yup im goin to pay dat milf a visit lmaoo
Shady bytches--why you got someone else's i.d. in your possession?? She ask "Did you get his name? Give him like $20?" Reply "No, I didn't know..."---🤔🙄😖😤 You didn't know the RIGHT THING TO DO? The kid did!! Wow...smh. Good thi g his Momma taught him better than how you act.  Awesome job young man!!
Hope he bought a belt with that money.
My man wants to get some cheeks
Good while no one is looking is God like   Being the bigger person is ruff....but it is worth it.      Good Teen
In the uk anyone would take it 💀
💜💪🏽 onions! 🥲 well done lil dude. Great people everywhere for raising that reward of over $2,000 for him  👏
He is an angel dressed in a thug’s clothing.  👼🏼🙏🏼
Yes this should be the .norm.  But it's not.
She bad
There is hope for humanity.  Mom u raised a fine young man.  He will go far in life.
You can never hear too many of these stories! Stellar man right there!
From these comments this is exactly why people don’t return things why block his blessing you absolutely should be rewarded for doing the right thing you Damn sure will be for doing the wrong things smh dog eat dog world and by the looks of it he should have ate
Smart Kid !!
I think he just wanted sex with the  brunette woman thats why he returned it
Good job mom.  That kid will always be a valued member of society.  I wish we had more like him.
Good story.Glad the cops didn't show up and murder him.
This shows how usa is so regressed that doing the right thing and actions is in the news and is unexpected.  Tells me everything about people and society in the usa.
he still it  don't se nothing inside he give it back
He wasn't probably being a Good Samaritan he was casing out the place. Did you see the way he looked past the woman to look into the house???
The mom of that kid needs to be rewarded too. What a woman!
That was very sweet of him to do. 🤍
adrian common W
Well done kid...and well done to those ladies for doing a great thing for him too.
Respect and honesty goes a long way… disrespectful people would be negative $3K by now paying off criminal charges etc, use your brain!
Don’t judge us cause we wear 501s
Hispanic moms always teach their kids to do the right thing
Good lad. I wish him a bright and successful future
He was raise by a good parents
GREAT STORY, GREAT GUY, THE WORLD NEEDS MORE GUYTS LIKE HIM, PEACE ON EARTH
Plot twist: his 3k reward was what he stole from her purse
Good man
What a lovely young man bless you boy
They raised 20k so far in th gofuind me. Thats crazy but i am happy for him!
Real
Making our name proud 😂
👏👏
By the way he looks, someone would judge him thinking he'd steal in it. This is the world we live in. Everybody wants their moment in the Sun. This young man didnt care about that. He just wanted to return a purse.
he’s so fine
Fantastic! Momma raised him right . . . AND . . . he listened! 💯💯💯
plot twist???
I have a feeling this kid will be rewarded with good a few more times in his lifetime. Much respect to this fine young man and your Mother for raising you the right way brother!!
What a fine young man!
That integrity is awesome.
Sure he’s not the one who took it? 💥
His mom is really proud of him right now :)
❤️❤️❤️❤️👑👑👑👑🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Good job young man good job
Hb wanted some cheeks
Very impressive
We need more people like this. Bet his mom is so proud.
Hard to believe these days
Good kid 👍👍👍
good young man, keep it up, showing a good example for other youth 💚
aw bless his soul, i hope he stays good like this forever.
he wanted a date
Parenting done right!
Wow super cool.  I’m a cyclist. I’ve found and returned  Maybe 20 wallets and iPhones in my life.   I got  a $100. Reward once.   LoL
Wow super cool.   I’m a cyclist.  I have found maybe 20 wallets in my life and returned them.  Only one did  I keep the reward.  It was at  Ventura and Reseda blvd. I found the guys phone  Number in his wallet.  I called him.  He shows up in a brand new Porsche.  He gave me $100.   I didn’t argue.   LoL
Nah this malandro was looking for a #😂
They're still hope for humanity
See, human beings do exist 💯💯🤟🏽🤟🏽
Little did they know, he was the one who ganked it. 🤣
Alright Adrian, way to go.. Hope your blessed always in your life .Good lesson for others.."Do the right thing"  Nice going Mom.
Wow. I’ve always returned found wallets and purses over the years to the customer service counter at the store. NOT ANY FREAKING MORE! I’m delivering it myself! 😂
10 bucks said he stole it found no money and returned it for a bag🤣🤣
Idk if he realizes it but he is representing every teenager that looks like him. N to me just speaks volume
Because  he was brought up with good parents.  That is why people like him should get  reword for there good actions.  He  is a very honest person  and I wish all the best for him.
I would hope that everyone was taught to do the right thing.
He thought they was cute lol
That proves our kids  have principles n not as someone  said not long ago, criminals, violators... Thanks So Very Much young man, you just have proven  many many people wrong. 👍👍👍👏👏👏👏❤
He saw the id and wanted to hit
That’s called integrity.     Good job young man. We all should take notes.
That's like... 3 dollars 💸  Californian
He looks like the one to steal the purse
3k? It said 3,700. That’s more than 3k lol
When I saw the title I thought it was gonna say 17 yo robs house. Nice seeing a change.
Good man, this youth could take tips from this good person
Always do the right thing, on a bad day, when nobody is watching.
That was AWESOME MAN !!!!!
Need more compassion like this
See, there is hope.
What a good man
That’s INTEGRITY. Doing the right thing when no one’s watching.
Plot twist: He stole it
LUCKYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
me personally I don’t want the 3k I want sum  else
Good kid.
It really helps and pays to do the right thing.
Doing the right thing when no one is watching is the sign of someone with the correct moral compass , and will go far in life !
We need more honest people like him. I want to see him for run for Congress. We have too many dishonest politicians.
Wow 😯 so great
That wasn’t the chick tho
I wish it was just film without edit. No news or interviews
Brilliant well done young man.
Integral 🙌🏾
Didn’t need to post about it on the internet. He’s really doing something amazing. Proud of you bro
So proud of you kid you make us so so proud man
Awesome video
I can’t believe stuff like this ends up on the news. This should just be common decency to other human beings. My husband found a wallet last week and returned it, that’s just what honest people do. I guess to those in Hollywood it’s a surprise that someone takes the time to help another fellow human being.
I found a guy’s wallet in Walmart parking lot, during Christmas time. Laying right in front of my car. Opened it up enough to see his name. It was full of cash, I could see the money but it wasn’t the point. Walked in Wally World, had them page the guy. I looked around and in just a few moments I seen some guy halling ass to customer service. Handed him his wallet he shook my hand. He couldn’t thank me enough. I said no problem brother it’s the right thing to do.
What a sad story.
there's more people in the world do good deeds and left unacknowledged  ,he simply lucked up and did it for the right person.
why not interview the boy tho 🧐🤨
She looks like Larissa from onlyfans..
He was tryna be the cheek clapping captain
Central Cee been a Good person
Good job young man and good job Mom for raising him the right way
hes cholo
Always doing the right even when no ones watching gives you the most satisfaction
A matter of pride ✊
Beautiful!
Notice how he’s latino
I love the Audi out front, totally in it for the karma.
He well had a crush on the dark haired girl! Lol
That's an awesome young man!
I know her she work in banquets
thats a bit much
Hope na I don't think so
This makes my heart happy. 😊👍♥️
🥰🥰🥰
Treat others as you would like to be treated. Seems so simple. This young man is an enlightened human being. Putting another person before himself. Very rare.
Well done young man! Extremely proud of your actions. 💙✌🏾
16m views for something that happens everyday. Tf is this channel
You teach good you get out of.
I hope he paid his taxes
When crime is so bad, that common courtesy makes the news.
He waned something else ☻️🏴‍☠️
The kids has big and yunmy hmmmmmm ahhhh ah ah ah oh oh oh ahhhh ah
Afterwards ah ah aha ah ohhhh oh oh
That's awesome
He became her uncle later on
Semper fidel⚖️💛
Good things happen to good people
john 3:16 for God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life❤
Jokes on you all, he was gathering information. Credit cards, drivers license, passports, social security, address, phone number, fingerprints, hair samples.
Hope is a part of faith. The two walk hand in hand. Death is guaranteed , where will you stand?
Beautiful ❤️
Integrity at its finest. Young man deserves this
Honest ese
Great kid 👍
Yo can someone lose their purse for me
Kids going places
It’s a nice story and all, but surely 3k could have been used for a better cause?
Big thumbs up !!! I’m so proud of this man and his momma 👍🏻🙌🏻🫶🏻
Good man.
Someone found my papas wallet once and called saying they found it but they took out his 100 and bank card. My nana even gave them money for finding it 😒 this was about 30 years ago.
One of the few good teens out there.
What a good kid 😊
Иван золо, это ты
There is no hope
I found a purse exactly like this and got it to the homeowner before she got home. Her husband, I’m assuming, was like confused to see me give him his wife’s purse. I hopped back in my truck and he yelled what’s your name? I told him and said you’re welcome and split. A couple weeks later a coworker wanted to say something after our pre-shift startup meeting. He busted out this letter to the editor from the wife thanking “Another Good Samaritan” and gave me a shoutout by name. It felt good.
This is a sign that kids of today have a chance to be good, I’m hoping for that.
Awesome!
How come this never happens to me when I return purses or wallets
All involved were beautiful souls. Well done Adrian, you did your mama proud.
Nice job young man 👍🏿💯
What a great response, same thing I tell my kids. Awesome. There is hope.
Dope kid
In Australia this not unusual for a teen to hand in a lost wallet, bt in America ppl treat like it's a miracle or something lol
You should never get paid on doing the respect for thing that's what life's about you respect yourself you respect others carry yourself in a great manner because character is everything
Nah he saw they was both bad on the id and drove to get there number
Lucky it wasn't a black kid who found it
Good ass man right there
What an awesome gentleman 👏 👏👏👏👏 His mom raised him right 👍
Kudos to his parents and him. Beyond the potential financial gain, it’s much more rewarding to your mental, spiritual and physical health when you do the right thing.
what a great lad
He probably saw the picture and thought maybe I could get some cheeks lol
That's the next generation we need. Not these thugs raiding stores and stealing
Only in daygo
3k? might as well just lose it
He wanted to check out that tia in person
Atta boy ! Lets go Adrian🤍
Goodness. Love it!
Adrian was raised right. What a great young man
Atta boy!!!
I see 3 good reasons
Boutta turn this into a side hustle checking 10 lots a day lmfaoo
Great young man. Too bad we're all not like that. The world would be a better place for sure. Dont take whats not yours, even if you find it.
I love this 😊
Respect 🙏
Good Awsome kid!!!
“Do the right thing even when no one is watching”
Good man! Salute to him!
one day i was working in the shop.  was going down a sidewalk, stood there and was kinda worried, there were 550Euros on the floor, nobody around. i took them and made  some rounds in the store, found a women that was searching for something and i had to ask her what is wrong, she said she lost the money that was paying her rent. she saw me pulling out that money, she almost collapsed, than she set down and wantet to huge me.  and damn it feld so right.
Still some parents doing it right :)
Thats so Cool.and nice to see honest great ppl
This guy probably stole it in the first place
Honesty is the best policy
Mom taught him right he has God with him always
After watching multiple crazy ring bell vedios, this is like sun shine on a cold windy day...... Bless the lad 🙏🙏🙏
No quema cuh!!!!!
Everyone got it wrong bro ain’t a good guy he see that fine women and played a dream in his head he returns it and she give him something else back 👀
Eliana is stunningly hot and beautiful damn
Well done mate.  Your parent is proud of you
This kid brought it back just for the chance of some poontang ☠️
There's still hope in this crazy fallen world, this young man just showed us the way. God bless your heart 💙
In Monaco we bring back everything specially in my work (private bus) where I find lot of things like IPad, telephone, cameras and more.
Good job lad.
all involved were good people...Go Fund Me is Not a good company...!
The auntie didn't give him anything and she said she didn't know ?? I swear the iq of people is getting lower as time goes by lol
STAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGED😂😂😂
What an old school gentleman
I regret growing up in a time when I did things like this and it was considered normal, i.e. without a 3K fundraising... Most I once got for returning a wallet (with cash, all cards, ID and license) was a bottle of wine.
I thought the ladies gave him 3k lol Misleading. Cool guy
This is exactly what I needed to start my day!
$19,000 now!!
link the go fund me :)
The reaction I got for doing this once was the people suspicious that I actually stole it from them. It makes me think twice now about even bothering with it. It's better to just turn it into a police station or call the service line and let them know you found it there. There isn't really anything you can do to defend yourself if someone claims you stole it.
I love it 🤙🏼
Kids today seem increasingly selfish, self-centered, and bad mannered. Even if there's no reward, no cash, no thanks. Do what you're supposed to do for the only reason that it's kind.
Wtf
Good man
When I see the beauty of the two women involved, I think we know this man's true motivation.   Hope they rewarded him
and he fine😩
He probably didnt take nothing because you probably didnt have no cash in it🤣
He finna get sum 😂😭😭👍
fake
Duh he just wrote down credit and debit card numbers and will charge anonymously later
Love it
Great parenting :)
Plot twist : that’s her son
Lol if u guys dint know this  But sometimes the person who stoled is the same person who sells it back  Its a mexican saying
Good job on that kid mom
Well raised and well mannered…my hope for humanity has risen a little
Awesome
my boy was just trynna get some poon ayy
Cool. Good guy
Awesome Young Man! God bless him. That’s amazing what the ladies did to raise go fund! 🙏🏼❤️
Aww this is such a great video to see given all the horrific acts taking place in our country! Awesome job young man am well done to his mother for raising him in such a great way with great values! Thank you for rewarding this young man as well! 💕
My man! Good job bro!!
Black hair has had quite a few rounds of Botox
I’m these type of situations this is the exact person we all should take after🤗
he so fine🤭
plot twist he stole a credit card lmao (jk) that’s awesome he returned it
Bravo 👏
🙂
Wow!!!!!! that is amazing!!!!!!!!! i feel so pround for him!!!!!!!!! great job!!!!!!!!!!!
wish every kid could be raised like him
What's sad is the mainstream media never covers good deeds,just violence and hate!!Good man!
He saw the id pic n had to do it
Great gesture to do, hats off to this guy!  What he gonna do with a purse though?
If she was ugly he would’ve kept the purse.. Dude is smart
That is awesome. Morals more people could use. That kid is going places.
Wholesome
It's so sad that we  live in a society where doing the right thing now makes the news. Congratulations to you young man for doing right, receiving a reward for it and making your parents proud.  👍
God is always watching, thank you for you kindness.
Totally normal in Europe🍺
GOD bless that young man amen JESUS CHRIST YESHUA HAMASHIACH IS LORD GOD KING CHRIST MESSIAH AND SAVIOUR AMEN AND HALLELUJAH!! ✝️❤️‍🔥💯🙏🏻
He is a great little man!
I've found purses and wallets fully loaded and I returned them to their owners and all I've gotten was 5 bucks 🤦🏾‍♂️
Good Job, mom!! DJT would have used her credit card 🥴
She wants him
You mean $19k !?
The feeling of doing the right thing and then later being acknowledged unexpectedly is better than any tangible reward…
Wow, that's incredible.  And these days, it speaks volumes.  Kudos to you, young man, and also to your mom who guided you down the right path.  The best to you in life!
His highschool game just went over 9000!!!
Nice deed !
The bag had to look like Greta's bag... ngl, he is brave.
Always do the right thing... « Even if you're alone and if nobody follows, keep defending what is right. » Abbé Pierre
He looked at that id picture and thought he should stop by lol
His parents did a great job with him. Would have loved to see his face when he received the money. No Good Deed Goes Unpunished.
That so warms my heart ❤️
Good job kid. Your parents did a good job raising you
Probably stole it himself
there is hope !
Lol! Democrats could learn a thing or two from that young man...
Great 🌟 👍 👌 job young man.🤗 This story made my day..thank you for sharing. 💫
Do good things even at your worse... Because Our Lord Jesus Christ is always watching us 😌😌
He definitely came back for some milf action!
We need more people like this in this 🌎 I always encourage my kids to always be humble, honest, kind and to always do the right thing, make good choices.
Lmao 👀 that's like 1 out of 500 billion people that would do that stop thinking there is hope for humanity...
Such a kind soul
Bless him
I did the same thing and only got a thank you 😭
😇🙏💯❣️❤️💓💞🌞
Phenomenal young man!  He lives by the Golden Rule! ❤
Is it so amazing and news worthy that a young black man was honest ?  Respect to him though.
Good man 👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
The reward was not only doing the right thing and a good deed but hell he probably actually got more money rewarded than what was in the purse at the time.
Ok
This was setup
Its always pleasant to see honesty, well done
Bro did a random activities task in gta 💀💀
He wanted to hit it
Plot twist : The man stole it and brought it back
When I was a Kid we found a wallet in front of a store with 60 dollars in it. we drove to the persons house the lady came to the door, we told her we found her wallet at the store and she grabbed the wallet and slammed the door in our faces without any comment.
and he would be judged by his clothes yet he is a great dude
awesome!!!!! we need more people like Adrian , especially in policymaking
Maybe there is hope?
i always return stuff when i can. its an awesome feeling
Ma sha Allah
So much bad news, and of course the news outlets always lead with the worst of it, so it's so nice to see a story like this.  The fact that it is a young Latino man is even better.
Never judge a book by its cover .. great job young man
FOUND A BAG,  MADE A BAG
He could’ve stole more than that
Big up yourself
I think we know why he wanted to return it in person... The friend probably looked hot in her driver's license photo.
This deserve. Billion likes
Ok so what really happened was he saw the ID photo thought she was hot and went to meet her 🤣😂🤣
Probably stole it in the first place 😆
Plot twist they planned the whole thing so they could make ez 4k on gofundme
That’s the world’s most cool teenager💪🤗👍♥️
he seen the milfs id and wanted some, hope he got it
Fake....of course
❤☝🏻👍🏻🙋🏻‍♂️✌🏻
This young man gives me hope, father material. YNWA.
Plot twist.  He knew he would get a bigger reward if he handed the bag to its owner.  Being kind never came into the equation.
Good man that does his family name well- Rodriguez
Great story and a great young man,thanks for making me smile.
Awesome young man, good job parents
Fine young man.  I'd be happy to hire him
Good boy
What kind of fiction is this? In the real world, if you return someone's purse, the person is probably ungrateful, and they might thank you but in reality you lost the money in the wallet. The person you returned it to probably wouldn't do the same in your shoes.
Time out, what was in the purse. I’m sorry. But. If there was no cash in that purse guys… Little bit less awe. Still a good thing! But yk?
Hopefully he uses some of the money to buy himself a belt.
fake
In a better world, this would be the normal thing to do and it wouldn't be news-worthy
This is what you get when mothers and fathers properly educate their children.
Real lexi lore gives pleasure reward.
The kids is better than most people. Advise to the kid: you will fail as a politician.
I’m just like this young man.good karma goes a long way!
I recently did the same thing I had to mail it back money and all it feels good
If there was ANY cash in it + still in it when returning THAT'S AMAZING +UNHEARD OF these days! I've actually had someone find my pine on the side of the road + was smart enough to call the "MA" contact (my mom) + returned it to me. That was so nice. I'm happy there's ppl like this in the world. 👍👍👍👍
It’s cause she’s Mexican and he’s Mexican too😂they stick together
Shocking
A friend of mine recently "lost" his phone at a McDonald's, only to find out someone snagged it from his table when he went to go pick up his order at the restaurant. Needless to say a homeless encampment resided right next to the restaurant. Later that day, finally rang and got hold of someone that picked up on the other end. The greedy bastard wanted $300 for the phone.  Oldest trick in the book. Just saying.
We need more of this young man in this generation. Lets gooo bro!!!
He was holding that purse like it was going to bite him 😎😂
This put a smile on many peoples faces
Bravo good sir.
I don't know him, but I'm proud him for doing the right thing, his mother deserves equal credit for raising her son to "do the right thing." We need more parents like this, and more young people like him. Also a HUGE thanks to all the people who contributed to his reward. God Bless all of them! 🙏❤
HOPE
Lol they both lovers
What a sweetheart. Rare kid
Good young man!  May his reward be multiplied in the name of Jesus!
Good parenting is key. What a nice story. We need more people like this in this world
Champion!!
There was a movie called “Do the Right Thing”. Maybe it should be shown in schools and on television.
bro should just link this video on his resume
hes bad i want him
That’s awesome!
Right on.. props to you and your mom !!!👍😉✌️
But why does it look like 2 different driveways
I did something like this as a kid. I think we were seeing a movie during a field trip and me and my friend were at the arcade and I found a $20 bill on the ground. I turned it in to the lost and found and they gave me $20 worth of arcade tokens as a reward. Me and my friend played the Jurassic Park game till we got the the 'T-rex chasing us in a jeep' part when our school bus arrived.
We respect you❤️❤️
wow
I hope she let him smash 👀
What's gonna happen when people find out he's related to them and they were just trying to get money?
fantastic deed   Great human being in the making  Kudos
My man
I found a iPhone 12 Pro Max in a shopping cart at the grocery store and returned it back to the owner and got $50
Good job Adrian. Others may not think so but he did the right thing and was rewarded for his honesty and the effort he went to, to return the lost purse. And good job to the ladies, for raising such a substantial sum for the reward for Adrian. He deserves every penny.
She probably dating him right now  I'm not gay but that is a good looking dude and her man that is a good look
Good old fashioned home upbringing, taught well and respectful, we need more of it in the world
Now I understand where Brazzers writers get their ideas
Good job young man that goes a long way trust me
Great kid
If only other young men were like this 🙏🏻
WHATS THE PIN NUMBER??? VICTIM RESPONDS I DON'T KNOW THE PIN NUMBER. WHERE'S THE PIN NUMBER??? VICTIM RESPONDS I DON'T HAVE THE PIN NUMBER. RECORDING BY AMATEUR SPY. HEARD BY PROFESSIONAL SPY.  GOOD BOY FOR RETURNED PURSE YOU WILL BE REWARDED MANY TIMES OVER...
Let that be a lesson to some of you that would have taken from the purse don't block your blessings trying to make a quick come up at the same time don't take from others when you wouldn't like someone to steal from you do unto others
Good on him for doing the right thing but do you know where that kid is right now?? Checking more parking lots for purses. I know I would be.
My faith in humanity is restored for now, it’s only a matter of time until my faith leaves again
Almost at $20k at this point in time. Wow
Easy get job when he  go to interview for job ,  famous kid
What’s his @ he’s cute
I hope this has a huge positive impact on his life 🙏
The kid is driving an Audi, and we wanna act surprised that he's returning a purse. lol  His parents raised a good kid,  but most kids aren't raised by adults who can afford to buy their teenager an Audi.
His parents can be so proud of him, well raised, well mannered... A true example how a teenager has to be. Best wishes to this guy and his family
<3
Whoopee Doo. If the doorbell didn't film it then no story.
Ist das bei euch in Amerika so erstaunlich wenn jemand etwas zurück bringt??? Das ist sehr traurig. Mein Bruder hat am Bahnhof in Deutschland ein Handy gefunden und dem Besitzer zurück gegeben. Am selben Tag hat er am Supermarkt eine Tasche mit einem Geldbeutel, mit Geld und sämtlichen Karten und noch etliches gefunden. Er hat diesen Mann angerufen und er kam und holte es ab. Er war so geizig, obwohl nichts fehlte, gab er keinen Cent. Das ist aber normal in Deutschland. Nicht überall, aber noch oft. Wir haben auch ein teures Handy verloren und wieder bekommen. Das ist wirklich traurig, daß so eine normale Sache, bei euch für Aufregung sorgt.
That's the way it use to be in my generation most of the time. We never thought much about it, it was just the right thing to do. Its nice to see integrity in a young person. I wonder why this is not practice much anymore?
Thank you parents and kind young man.
Good lad !!
We need more people like him
the young : damned i was filmed, i can't keep it ..
Atta boy!
Man probably stole it then brought it back to look good and got over 3000 for it ... loool
He will be blessed forever🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙏🏾
No everyone aint bad, also no to attention seeking on youtube.
Seriously, is this not a normal human reaction to return something found.
Lol thats normal in Switzerland
What a great story all round.
What a beautiful young lad.
Integrity means alot
Interesting he went out his way to bring it to her vs just giving it to the store it was at
The next day ey foo let me get a pound of bud g I came up with some money g
I dropped my wallet leaving the bank and it had my entire rent payment inside of it, I couldn’t find it for the entire day and I went crazy looking for it, I got a message on FB a few hours later saying they found my wallet and looked me up using my license, they could of walked away with over 1200 dollars and instead returned it all to me and wouldn’t even think of taking a reward. There is hope, you just need to get your head out of social media and stop letting one tik tok video change your opinion on society.
It's good to see Americans making this place better little by little it warms my heart to see America be better.
I found some dudes 20k bike that fell out of his truck and brought it back to him and he gave me $20 😂😂😂😭😭
God bless him 🤍✨🙏🏽😊
I would of called the cops on his azz!
85,000 new IRS agents about to snatch that boy’s soul
Good people still exist. 👍🏻
I kept one and got double the reward bro took a L
Great kid
Thats whats up!
My man should have tapped them two latinas god dayuummmm 🥵
An inch of empathy gives you a mile of love
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I applaud the mom and these women and the people who rewarded this young man but mostly I applaud the young man to be an honest kid and an example to others......God bless you and prosper your life and prolong your days here on earth
We need more kids like you.
I'm reading the comments and i would love to point out, instead of telling ourselves "we need more like him" , how about we start to do it ourselves.
what a g
Let's be honest he saw the ID picture and was trying to smash the friend.
Man why does everyone in US dress as gang members or hobos
why don’t i ever get this kinda news. stupid algorithm
Wonderful story! I can’t help but notice that the girl who lost her purse has an enlarged thyroid, and should get this checked out if she hasn’t already. Only saying this with the hope to help as I had the same thing and someone let me know in the supermarket which caused me to see my doctor and get it treated.
I love these kind of stories!
How cute 🥰
Plot twist: He was hopping for something else 😆
ngl he’s fine
He look off too but he broken the stereotype don't cover the book by its judge.
found a purse at my (ex) work with roughly 100k in jewelry inside it. I worked at a nice hotel. the lady forgot it in the safe (she didn't think it was even there) and I retrieved it for her and let her ASAP. No management was there or anything. I made sure to contact the lady and make sure she got her valuables. when i told my manager the situation she got mad at me and sped off to the police station to make them take it from us. they refused. she responded to me by firing me. she proceeded to believe this lady was a liar and it wasn't her purse.... yeah because she just sooo happened to guess the code of a 9 digit safe first try...? unfortunately got fired for doing the right thing. Was more happy this lady got her stuff back.. Mill Creek Hotel In Lake Geneva SUCKS lol..
She definitely waiting till hws 18 🤣
I found two wallets separate times....first 1 had about $400 in it, I called a number in it and it was the owner, he thought he left his wallet at home 3hrs away he met up with me and gave me $50...The next I found had about $360 in it and it belonged to a old man...I called a number I found inside the wallet and it was his niece and she said he suffers from dimentia and would have dropped it...I told her to contact her uncle and let him know I handed it in at the local police station...he gave me a call saying how greatful he was...it honestly felt better then the fifty bucks.
This young man has a better understanding of what integrity means than most adults! Good job momma you raised him right! ❤️
Well done Adrian 🙌
He seen her DL and was hopeful….  LoL
Isn’t this the normal human reaction?
I wonder if the kid didn’t want to be found and yet they searched for him like he did something.
Muy Bien Echo!
Thank you for being a good person
Interesting
The lady with the black hair - her smile looks pained lol
The mentality of mankind is EVOLVING
Good job recognizing that young man. That is rare today . God-bless you
$3k & cheeks he blessed 🙏
W
Protect this young man at all costs because we need him and we need many more like him
Being good and honest outweighs the bad in the long run.
W
nooo hes trying to get sum 😼
i love it ! omg.
Respect,parents raised a fine king/there’s still some great ones out here n many blessings
Good job man! That’s awesome. Feels good getting rewarded for doing the right thing.
Gangster Style but Lionheard !
My man was hoping for some booty after he saw her face in the ID maybe
Or they knew him and split the go fund me money ?
Hell yeah some ppl be coo
Good job young man.
So you can read an person by the way they look.. good for him.. hope white police take note..
Awhhh
It’s always “we need more people like this” and never “I will be more like this”
1 Out of 3 Million
you do this in GTA and they give you 50 to 200 bucks
Ngl, he's damn cute.. With a golden heart to boot
good happy ending
A couple years ago, someone’s car had been broken into and a lot of her personal belongings were stolen. Some kids broke into it and took what they want and left a bunch of other personal items with her information on it. I gathered it all up and waited for my shift to end. Then I brought her belongings to her house personally where I got to meet an officer as well. She was in the process of reporting her incident to the officer when i approached. Not gonna lie, I thought they were gonna accuse me of being the one who broke in, but I had proof that I was at work when I found the stuff. I wasn’t rewarded or anything but it still felt good knowing I did the right thing 💪 shout out to that kid though, most kids nowadays would’ve taken everything without thinking twice about it 😤
Ok so the thumbnail is of the thug who stole it
Wow what a good good story love hearing stories like this that involve good deeds
good job kid 👏  parents really do set the example for their children. it's more important than people know.
one word Integrity 🙌 👏
Great Job young man we need more like you in this world.
Great fkn guy
🔥💯
This is America. His life matters.
So cool well done young man blessed
Aunty is hot😂
What?
Great kid raised by a great Mother, he deserved to be rewarded!  😇😇
There is no hope in our generation💀💀💀💀💀💀
Awesome! That kid deserves it!
Moms must be super proud . good job. I found a wallet with almost 3k in the Home depot parking lot. figured it belong to someone with a job to be done so I followed the address on the ID and found him. He was so relieved ,the money was payment for materials and the person who hired him thought he was ripping them off. I believe in Karma. wish there was more people like this kid.
Love it!
My man looks like central cee
His Mum taught him very well! Now he can teach his own some day
Eliana is hot af.
She low key wanted to invite him in and give him some poon poon
Never judge a book by its cover 🙏💯
Shenanigans!!
Way to go kid. Ya did your mom proud. 👍
I believe in good karma 🙏🏻
Dizzy sucker idiots. He would have been satisfied with $100
My mom always tells me to do the right thing even tho I’m not perfect I remember finding a wallet on my street and I looked in it and returned it to a local apartment to an elderly man. It’s true what they said good deeds do get rewarded
He probably stole the purse then returned it for the money
He probably took it.
Saw that I.D
“There’s hope” and you left the purse!?!? There’s no hope for older generation the 🤦🏻‍♂️
I wish my story got this big lmao so i can get money from cashapp 😂😂 i went to two houses because the wallet i found the Id had a wrong address and i looked her up on Google and found her updated address so i did a whole scavenger hunt to find her the wallet had a lot of money (I didn’t steal anything of course ) but and all her important identification she didn’t even realize her wallet was gone. I just knew when she did notice she would’ve freaked out
Ring is all videos might as well be tic tok
Not that’s a young man I would love as a son in law❤️❤️❤️
It's sad to say that this is shocking. Good on him though. There's hope.
this CUH has good manners.
Kudos to his parents for raising such a rare gem ❤️🤗
latinos guys
He went there to get some milf instead she posted to the Internet 🤣
16mill views. This channel profits the most out of it lol
Boss
God tested him, and he beat the test.
Very courteous and noble of him
Twenty blux
His mom should get half, she raised a good human
What a great young man who listened to his mother!! God rewards honesty and integrity!
Instead of saying if there were people like this how about just being people like this or least try to be✌🏽
Nice to see a fine young man doing the right thing in our upside down troubled world.
I returned an item to SafeWay the other day that they didn't scan. Everyone was amazed. "You never see that these days"
Honestly? Am I supposed to believe this is real?!😆 now I’m not saying it can’t happen in real life. I’m just saying this story is most likely fake just like almost everything else on mainstream news. How the hell would it end up on tv?!
Hi from Will and Mr Data :):]  Im in 3d printing and youd think wed be full of honest nerds but clearly not. Extremly unusual. Im very impressed to hear about a honest person its so extremely  rear the 3 grand was well deserved. Well done dood. We wish you nice success. Be well.
I found a Calvin Klein purse with $6.80 in it. I was flat broke and could have really used the money to buy food. I was able to hand it into the local Police station the next day, they were closed on the day I found it. A couple of days later the Police rang me and asked if it was okay to give my number to the owner as they had collected the purse. They were really happy to get it back and gave me $20. I was able to buy some steak and I was really happy too
i would have £5,000 if i got rewarded for everything i’ve done
why is this news
I have returned all the things that I have found in my life but I lost many of my valuables on a train in Germany but nothing came back
My man’s got a months paycheck dangling off his neck of course he returned that purse what you thought?
Years ago, I did the same thing. I got $2. I wasn’t expecting anything:)
Bless him and bless his Mom for raising him the right way. Take notes, people.
A moment of silence for that gorgeous latina with the black hair.
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
That girl look likes mj
Very dope
Good on whoever raised him!!! He’s a fine young gentleman any girl would be lucky to have him it’s rare to see pure honesty these days it was a nice change seeing this
Im pretty sure the dude saw the ID and was tryna smash hahaha
I mean props to this guy , but i probally would have kept the bag
Already the makings of a great man - much respect
Good story🙂👍
I love you brother Adrian Rodriguez you have a gorgeous heart and that goes with our last name
Top man
That's wonderful
We dont need more peoples like him...              We need to be like him
Don’t judge a book by its cover
It is curious that what we have always seen as something quite normal all our lives is seen by others as something unusual or even spectacular. If all of humanity were Jehovah's Witnesses, these actors would be the norm and not the exception, as is the case with all other religions.
Thank you for a good news story.  What a wonderful young man,  and those sweet ladies.  Gees.... I lost my best fishing pole ever. A young lady found it, kept it safe until I came back looking for it she asked me if I lost something I told her yes. She said here it is. I said oh you deserve a reward.  I had zero cash on me, but I ran got money her and amazingly she was still there. I gave her all I could find in cash 8 bucks. I was relieved to have my luckiest fishing pole back.  I want more incredible stories just like this.
Plot twist, he stole the purse!!! Jk don't hit me
awesome stuff 💯🙌🏼
Good job young man  But damn those Botox won’t do well for her in the future
Good kid 👍 raised with good morals from the parents. Not like 99% of the other teens these days.
Plot twist: There were cameras everywhere and no cash inside the purse 🤓
This is what should be on the evening news instead of all the horrible divisive trash they normally show
Good guy
Awesome Soul !
Good lad. God bless him.
What’s his Instagram 😩
That's so nice God bless him
Notice how the young man did not record himself taking the purse to the woman and posting all over social media. He wanted to do the right thing for the right reasons. Kudos to him and his parents!
Doing the right thing when nobody is watching is called integrity
Is that trouble kidd?😂
I like how you all assume he wanted to do right . Man’s was trying to tap that , seen the Id said hell yeah she gonna let me slide once I return her lost property. Smart kid . Playa playa
Inside edition should give him a quarter of what they made on this youtube video
I did the same and I got a chocolate box as a gift.
Doing the right thing when no one is looking is called Integrity
I had to like this video
What’s crazy is that I found someone’s wallet at the gas station, I went to their house but no one was there. Posted onto our neighbourhood community page trying to find him with no luck. In the evening went back to the guys house to leave the wallet…oh my gosh, I was met with threats, that they had reported me to the police for stealing, to make sure I turned myself in to the police etc etc. the lady even had the audacity to go through the wallet in front of me counting the money asking me “did you take some, did you take some? I’m counting it”….never again will I help someone out!
Well done young man!
He’s not a good kid. Just one deed doesn’t change he’s a gangster and a drug dealer.
I returned a woman's purse years ago. Even went to her house to return it. There was money in it which I left in the purse. She wasn't home, but her husband was there working outside. He did "thank me", but he only bothered to face me to take the purse. I didn't expect any money, but his half-assed acknowledgement bothered me. At least look at the person that is doing you the favor.
I had just cashed my check and lost my wallet. I got the wallet back empty. I was happy to get my I.D back, but it was a prime example of raised wrong and raised right. All mixed into one.
🤧🤧🥹🥹
I don’t get why smt like this is on the news it not important lmao
Why reward him. He has already rewarded himself
HAHHA its hilarious how everyone in the comments haven't put together the fact he is a teen boy who just found a hot woman's    purse with her photo ID in the bag. He was looking for a different kind of  reward.
What a guy!!!
Imagined if he just kept the purse, and only would have gotten $50.  Kindness is its own reward.
I love this story!!  This young man was raised with great morals and the importance of integrity and honesty!
Good boy.
Hi
Bob is Adrien he coulda took anything no what did I tell you he didn’t find anything but u lost it u worked for that money like movie do the right thing give it back gracius
good boy 👍
And that’s how it should be! 🙌🫡
How tf do you leave your purse in a shopping cart?
Typical media, spinning this like little homie didn't tap her cards or take the cash... come on  now. I don't normally conduct in any form of racial profiling, but if/when I do... this would be a good opportunity 👌 👍 🤣
The gofund me is up to $19,051 as of Sept 3rd with people still donating.  Top donor gave $2250.
Lost purse? Gave it back for 3k award? This guy ??? Cmon guys 😂
Good job mom!!
Bro knew why he did that
Notice he did not record himself doing a good deed like most other disgusting individuals who crave likes and attention. We should report all videos showing conceited a holes who record themselves doing "good" deeds or else this will only get worse...
*Back in the day my friend and I returned a walletfrom an old lady.  We were happy with our shared reward of 5 euro's*😅   Feel free to give me 3000 dollars after you read this lol
It’s starts at home👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
My faith in youth of today is restored - nice work 👌
Unfortunately he represents only 0.01%
Still waiting for someone from the government to show up on my door to return what they took.  Nothing so far
We need news like this more. News like this will make kids believe they live in a good world and they will learn from stories like this.
How did the lady not realize where she left her purse? I would be crazy looking for it.
This makes me wanna 🥲🙏🙏😇😇if I had a kid I would raise him to be This way.
Adrian is a first class guy...God bless that young man....hes  a going places kinda guy
He’s kindaa…
why is he being celebrated for the bare minimum?
NICE!
Good acts need to be rewarded, thank you for that !
Shows great character. Well done 👍
I LOVE GoFundMe….and was happy to add to the donations. I am thrilled Adrian has bought a car!
Bro got more money than he would of if he stole it lmao good choice
hola
He thought the owner of that purse was hot and thought he could get some. Hahaha
Take note kids
Na its
Here you go got thlsonads dollars
Yes sir 💯💯💥💥💥
attaboy
My faith inhumanity is always saved by actions done by very fine people like this young man.
Don't you know that's the new thing trending..........steal a person's belongings then return it to the owner intact, nothing missing then hope for a reward.........I'm telling you, it's the new trend....😎
We need more good in the world
Only 3,780! He could have made more selling her identity 😆 🤣
This is news? Dude did what he was supposed to do. Why we celebrating that smh. Wack as hell.
We must all show that  heros get good karma. Also for the owner of the wallet purse....how nice of you to show the boy GOOD KARMA.  Tis made my day. Karma all the way♡
I returned a guys wallet once.  I had to pay long distance to call his parents in Ontario to get his address, and barely got a thank you 😮‍💨
But it’s dangerous what he did too he could be get arrested for doing good.
He wanted a phone number but money is good too
Good work bro 🤝
Good job young man.
Everything starts from home. His mom taught him very well. Rubbish parents, you get rubbish kids.
I need to be like this man.
Why is this on the news? I did the same thing but with a wallet.
Literally 15M views on a common sense action. That's showing everyone's humanity coefficient.
It's nice that he was also rewarded! His mama is right, even when no one is watching do the right thing! And look, karma can be so beautiful!
nice
Good job brother, awesome character
We live in such degeneracy that a simple REGULAR action equals a news story.
💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Good mother good sun , wat a sorpriese ,
damn that aunt is fiiiiine
“Hope for our young generation “
One time when I was about 10 years old we were on a family vacation in Miami FL in like the early 2000s. We were taking a tour of this really nice hotel and we had this sweet older man as our guide showing us around. The hotel itself was right by a very busy beach that was packed with people and my brother (he was about 16 at the time) lost his wallet when we had been swimming at the beach. He had his permit/ID and about $200+ in there that he’d saved for the trip and he was so upset about it. About an hour or two passes and we’re wrapping up and the guide tells us that a wallet had been turned in to the hotel, it was my brother’s wallet. We had honestly thought there was no hope of it being returned and my brother was so relieved and grateful. But I’ll never forget seeing our guide shed a tear and wiping his eyes he said something about there still being good caring people in this world. We never got to thank the person who turned it in, but they did an amazing thing that day just like this awesome young man who returned that purse. He has good karma coming his way. ❤️
W kid
Good man.
i bet you the real reason is "because my mom told me to"
Adrian is very much fine
What a wholesome kid. Someone get him out of California.
This is what's up.
Plot twist.. my guy just wanted some puuusaaay 👀🤣
He saw the her ID was all like damn I gotta return it.
Plot twist it’s actually his
This was in the news? I think it is pretty normal in other countrys
There is hope, yes
Didn't watch, stole it and returned it for the reward
Trust, Respect, and Kindness. Respect. 👊👊💖
The only reason this is getting so many positive reactions is because he's dressed like a gangster and people stereotypically expect him to steal the purse. Many people do this daily and don't get the same attention. I am two of them 😊
Dude why is this on YouTube/news? This should be a normal thing, like dude if someone lost something just give it back? It shouldn’t be a big deal😂😂🤦🏻‍♂️
I’m sure my mans was hoping she’d put out as a reward instead of the $3k haha jk
That kid was raised right.  Great job dude.
Very 👍 🏖
🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
Great job young man. Good things come your way when you do the right thing.
Good man
Good Man.
That's doing the right thing
Lol I bet he returned it hoping to get a date
SPOILER: he stole the purse in the first place.
Damn could've got her number too bruh
Sure, how many people do nice things but don't get 3k in rewards and ends up on the news? lmao
We need to be like him❤️👍
The sad part about this story is that why does the society labelled that dude as someone who wouldn't do such deed? Is it the way he looks? Good Samaritans come in different shapes and sizes.
17 year old steals purse then gives it back acting like he never stole it
A good or bad deed never goes unseen ❤️💪🥰😇🙏
THERE WAS THIS ONE TIME THAT I WAS AT FOOD 4 LESS AND A LADY WAS GETTING CHANGE AND SHE HAPPENED TO DROP A $ 100 DOLLAR BILL I DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL I HAPPEN TO LOOK DOWN AND I SEEN THE BILL 💵 ON THE FLOOR AND PICK IT UP AND I LET HER KNOW GAVE IT BACK TO HER DID SHE THANK ME... (NO) SHE DIDN'T
Oh so they had nothing to reward him with and so they sent him on his way. Then they thought "for da clout" and asked everyone else to pay for it.
this is normal where i live. making such a big deal out of this just shown how destroyed US is. :D
luckily a mexican found it and not a blackie
He Lucky to have the reward Cash 💵
Do good, even when no one is watching. That's a good quote that everyone should follow. Good man right there.👍👍
very brave just to even carry that purse. It does not match his outfit.
lol the exact opposite happen to me i lost 3k from my account after my wallet is stolen
I think if he was dressed different they wouldn’t have been so surprised.  Never judge a book by its cover.  Also, when did not stealing something become an OMG thing.
Did he really need the money tho? The guy pulled up in an Audi and he's wearing jewellery.. its obvious that he's rich
Honesty must be so rare these days it's so shocking it's in the news
Good man.
Lady: omg thank you so much!!! Bro: no problemuh cuh
And he Mexican Pa Que sepan gringos !
God bless
When I was a kid I saw a wallet outside my school with over $4000 and immediately gave it to the principal.
How it should always be
Everyone should do this.. sad people expect the worst these days..
What if he stole the purse and than felt guilty so he returned it
Similar thing happened to me when I was a kid, A lady drove off with her purse on the roof of her car.  I picked it up and walked a few kms to give it back to her.  Randomly in the local newspaper there was an article about it and I got a box of chocolates as a reward.  Not quite 3k but was so excited when I was a kid haha
If it would of been a banana eater that would of been gone not returned
First thing mans probably did was buy some 4s and a bb Simon belt
Pffft I can do what he did too, I just haven’t found a purse yet
He’s dressed in a way where he would be judged by many people regardless if he’s doing the right or wrong thing.  Just proves that “wanna be thug” isn’t always a bad person because they wear baggy clothes n dress a certain way.  Glad he showed some people judging based on appearances can lead you to the wrong assumptions and make you miss out on good people in the world. He did the right thing his parents should be proud.  Love seeing a young person break a stereotype set by older generations
The real answer is he wasn’t broke
Bravo mijo
Great job showing integrity
POV:he tooked everything that was in the bag and returned it empty
Fact he stole it then saw if returned 3k so he returned it
Lil Maru didn’t need that chump change lol jk
What is sad is that it should be normal.  This world is a mess.
Honestly, with all the robbery and purse snatching in CA he could’ve taken things and never returned it so he does deserves the reward. 💛
no way in hell some one do this  if some one  give them back a lost item my get 20 bucks for it   well i know no one on yt will help out on this
I think everyone is ignoring the 3k reward part of this lol
always do the right thing, because you could get slightly rich from it 😎
The guy saw her ID and thought: this could be one of those "amateur" videos on internet. Let's try! Instead of that he got 3K. Not bad!
this the bare minimum tho 😭
It's annoying when these old people that raised the current generation say ignorant stuff like "ThErE's HoPe FoR tHe CuRrEnT gEnErAtIoN."
One time I was at the grocery store and this elderly gentleman was paying for his groceries. He opened his wallet to pull out his cash and while doing this half of a large portion of that cash fell on the floor mostly hundreds and if I were to guess would say a it was over 5 grand. No one saw but me and my daughter not even the cashier I tried to get his attention i as he was walking away because I  didn't want his saying any cash was missing but he ignored me like I was bothering him. He kept walking so I picked up the cash and walked up to him and tapped him on his shoulder and said excuse me Sr you dropped some cash. He turned around and didn't say a word snatched the money out of my hand turned around and walked away like he didn't even care if he lost it. I remember the cashier looking at the cash in amazement of the amount and my daughter telling me you should have kept it dad. I turned to her and said I didn't return it for him I returned it for me. She looked confused but I know the influence was worth the loss that that money could have helped my situation at the time. Needless to say we got through being broke, we did not die, my life turned out great, and my daughter learned a quality that is priceless Honesty!
Man she's hot!
He opened up the purse saw a pic of an absolute milf, stuck his best chains on and went round with the good boy story.
What a wonderful young man, who has been raised to follow and uphold good moral values.
He’s very lucky to get something. Lot people returned items and never get anything in return
hahah glonojady:DDD
Surprising this happened in California. Yeah California......did I mention California? Wow ... California....
There’s hope for our younger generation we’re all fked if inflation doesn’t go down
Why say we need more people like him instead of saying we need to act like him?
Sad that basic decency is now considered “news” society is decaying
Awesomeness!!! Restores your faith in humanity ♥️
Pulling his pants up before the door opens 💪🏽
This is also a GoFundMe scam, maybe not this one in particular. People say they lose something or donate something, get donations then split it 50/50. Be careful what you donate to.
Glad to see such a positive story get so many views. Usually it's the opposite. Just goes to show POSITIVETY trumps all (no pun intended). Only if more people like this could e brought to light by the media. Good people helping their neighbors is what this Country was founded upon. I think we have lost that in this new age of technology. Just know their good people doing good things every minute of every day!
The Earth is flat.
Bless up to that young man !!!!!!!
👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Honest people still exist. I love reading such inspirational stories
God is good ✝️🙏💯
$3K, nice.

God bless him. He’s a courageous young man. Thanks to his mommy for raising him to do the right thing even when no one is watching. May the Lord always bless you young man🙏
latin ppl best ppl in WORLD
“There’s hope for our younger generation”. Girl, look at at your own generation and tell me it’s ALL millennials fault lol! We weren’t even born!
The teen that drives an audi car returned the bag xD. A NORMAL teenager would probably take it.
When i bringed back a wallet with 350 euros and many documents inside to a one woman and her small child i almost didnt got a "thank you" back... Pffff a bit sad story
Absolutely love it, need more just like him.
People
I’m sorry but he’s so fine
God bless this young man 🙏😁 His Momma has got to be so proud 💞
Puro Mexico!
WoW
Wow
Dudes a literal chad
Wish we ALL could get paid for doin the right thing....  This is cool but should normal, disturbing that it's not.
honorable guy👏👏👏👏👏
What a wonderful dude!!! Good deeds reaps good karma! Keep being u, proud of him.
Bro definitely hit that
Well done, Adrian. You're quite the gentleman.
One in a million unfortunately Most would just Rob the stuff
This is what news should be about.
dear god what we have become as a society now we feel the need to post irrelevant videos to get attention.
POV: he took her lipgloss and she never noticed
"let me hold that money for you"
There is a glimmer of hope for this next generation
Bless this man with a good wife someday he deserves it
how can you leave your purse and not even notice? this smells like another fund raise fake
👍👍👍👍👍
Thats awesome good job bro
Once I tried to do the same. But, the owner handed over me to the police. Now I'm in jail. Writing the comment with the guard's phone.
Angles among us.
BBC
How does he know where she lives
Biggest Mistake this Kid ever Made 😂
Fake
Makes me smile!! Simple ♥️
plot twist he is the one who stole the purse
Is this not a standard in America? In our country it is normal to return something lost, nomore getting 3k for it like wtf
He lost allot himself huh...
Now that’s how what we need, good people like this teen.
This restores faith in humanity.
That part
This young man is a King
crazy how something so normal goes viral... ive done this four times and never once got a reward or made it on inside edition. everyone should return things that arent theirs and do the right thing its common sense
Good boy..God blessed you 🙏 ❤️
Use your integrity
We dont need more people like him we gotta be like him
Ik it’s supposed to be like “the kid dod a good job wish there was people like him” But the kid looks emo in my opinion 💀
He’s probably the guy that stole it
he shouldn't have gotten rewarded for doing something that should be considered the normal moral thing to do.
holy cow the nose on that one woman
Outstanding young man.
Second reason is the best. If you lost your wallet, you'd like someone to give it back to you... Do to others what YOU would like others do to you !
Best thing is he dressup just make the devolution funnier
This proves the point that all young people aren't always dishonest.
To be honest, I would’ve done the same thing. I thought this was just being a normal person.
GoFundMe is now up to $18k!!
His mom did the right thing she raised a good kid
I love this kid! Its how we raise our children that how they become and behave just like this kid.Excellent example! Kudos this kid and his parents!! 👏 👏
Hope Delilah broke dude off some
Edgars do good things
Respect for the parents who raised this fine young man!
Fine young man right there. As those women put it. Hope for our future generations.
1. He who stole the purse for money. But there's no money in the bag so he decided to give it back to the owner. He didn't expect that he'll get reward and popularity for stealing a purse Just think once how someone could  forget a purse. 2.this purposely done by both to become famous on internet. 15m fools believed this but that one smart genius guy (me) knows the this is fake.
Good job to this young man did a good thing and was blessed
Plot twist: *he stole it and gave it back*
Fool went n got stoned
what actually happened:  "no money in here, oh an I.d. DANG she's HOT. I'm gonna go flirt."  *gets nervous*  "aight I'm a head out"  *gets rewarded*
He look chill asf too👌🏽
Bros doing a GTA side mission
Cmon people I’m from the hood so I know what’s going on, he retuned the purse just to find out more information on the person and what kind of house they have and what they drive, he was plotting to come back and Rob that house I wouldn’t trust that little Mexican no way !!
Look at that 👍🏻💯 it comes back around even better . Maybe 10 out of 1 million 17 year olds  would do that. Good man
His mother raised him well
Get you a man that'll return a purse
that’s sweet but isn’t a huge deal . keep your standards high
That's a quality young man
Image if He stole it then returned it cause nothing good was in it
How sad it is that this has to be celebrated...
Romans 10:9-10 BIBLE - That if you confess with your mouth the Son of God Lord Jesus Christ and believe in your heart, that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.🌈🌈....For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through the Son of God Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:23) bible.... FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD, THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON OF GOD JESUS CHRIST, WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM SHALL NOT PERISH, BUT HAVE  EVERLASTING LIFE IN HEAVEN FOREVER AND EVER. John 3:16...BIBLE........... HOT SUMMER NIGHTS AND DAYS..2022 2022  5
There is still hope..
Great young man.. wish him nothing but the best.. still good people out here
Nice man <3
What a decent young man - well done that is really special to see in the world today. I am pleased that you have been rewarded as a thank you, you deserve that. Big thumbs up.
BREAKING NEWS: Young man does decent thing.
This gives me so much hope! I'm raising my 3 year old and 4 month old to do exactly what that young MAN did! 👍🧡
my ass. he saw her picture on the driving license and she was HOTTT 🔥🔥🔥
People who watch anime will do d same.😤 U know wat m talking bout.
Such a kind young man! God bless him ❤️
Politicians should have a seminar with this young man.
So in USA it is that rare ????
You get more out of that than robbing a person and stealing, some people should get the hint
Thats my purse, i dont know you!!!!
Goku solos
Hes so lucky theres no one reported or a freaking clown police notice him with a purse and detained him
We need more people like him and his parents more than ever. God bless him.
Great Job Young Man! Making his parents proud.
I know a family that also goes by this principle, the 16 year old son works on my yard every two weeks, does a fantastic job every time always says thank you when I pay him. His Mom taught him honor before self and I see it every time he comes to work. Now his Mom is going to undergo surgery and she needs prayers, I do not want to see this young man crushed should things not go well. But even then I am sure he would still Honor his Mom by doing the right thing each and every time!!!!
I am very proud of this young man, he is more of a man than some people my age as senior citizens. They started a go fund me and raised over $3,700 dollars of which the young man totally deserves. Much credit goes to his Mom that raised him correctly, I am really sure she is proud of her 17 year old son!!! He made her look really good by listening to what Mom taught him. To see that people that do not know the man give of their hard earned money also says much, thank you for giving!!!! My Mom taught us the same thing, this is how I joined the military and worked with my local sheriff's office for 20 years. My Mom was so very proud that I had indeed listened. If I were local to where this young man lives I would take him to a steak dinner at my expense and make a big deal of it!! Seems the city mayor should do something to recognize this awesome young man!!!!
We reached a point where we make news when somebody is kind
omg- he must be so kind usually pple would steel i T_T
I would do the same thing because I was taught well by my Christian family
Bet money that lady kept most of the money. She looks like that type
Guy saw her listen picture than retuned bc he was trying to smash 🤣
My man 💪 he knew he was owed a reward, that's why he kinda stayed after returning it lol.still he deserved what he  got. Here in the UK he would of got nothing. USA is better than UK in this situation.
Goodhearted ❤️
This is on the news?? How bad is America if this is on the news
Jesus Christ is Lord for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life
How the hell do you leave your purse in a shopping cart ?
She should have given him that ass on the Audi in and blow! Just to be nice to a hero I hope she did
very rare in today's world, even though we should all be like this
This is the kind of integrity my parents raise me to have as well. God bless that mother and her son for being exactly the kind of people we need in today's sad times.
Glad it ended good for the kid and he didn't have a Karen's purse instead!
Plot twist:            he took the money in it than returned it...
He now has 19k
No good deed goes unpunished...yesterday that saying was myth busted. This construction worker left his $1,203.92 expensive smartphone in a bathroom stall at a restaurant and was found by a customer who took it and left. He looked through the phone at a local park and didn't care for the phone much(since he thought to himself that it might have a tracker app installed) so he was about to throw it in the park's trash can but something in the back of his mind told him to go back to the restaurant and wait. So he did and 8 minutes after arrivng there, the smartphone rang. It was the owner and he told him that he needed the phone back because it had all his important business phone number contacts and that he would reward him if he got his phone back undamaged. They met in front of the restaurant and he handed over the phone...no cops were involved. And after inspecting the smartphone he then decided to reward that guy with $880.00 cash. Some times it does pay off to be honest.
That’s rare! 👍
I have returned 10.000$ and 10 credit cards from a business man and he did gave me nothing
Smells fake...
Homie was just waiting for a milf scene to take place when he brought back the purse
There’s always hope 💫🙏🏼
Even when taught to do the right thing, kids don't always do it. It's great when they do.
“There’s hope for our younger generation “🤓🤓 there was never no hope Tf they good kids
Last time I returned a purse the person was rude and accused me of stealing it in the first place. Mind you that all the belongings where intact but I guess some people stereotype. The comment was in a sarcastic tone “What a surprise a latino had it.” One of my first time experiencing racial stereotype. I grew in Puerto Rico so I did not experience racism until I traveled to USA to serve the army. It was shocking to say the least.
lol this is the fakest thing I ever seen
Great kid 🙏🏻
Now that’s a reward!
this made my day!
Can you lost your bag everyday please ?😇
he can buy a belt for his pants now. jk good to see there is some hope
be thankful because that teen is not BLACK 🤦🏿‍♂️😂 if that teen is black time to say goodbye to your purse 👜
bro finished a contract mission
Plot twist: HE stole the purse to get the reward!! 😂😂
imagine he got 50 bucks from her stuff and then brings it to her back and  getting 3k lmao
he fine
Bro he went to go shoot his shot 😂
So he returned it after he stole it to get more money.
What a great young man. Good parenting.
Respect to raza. Now switch the color. Different results
I've had my wallet stolen a few times last time it happened I was literally about to buy food for my kids and I couldn't.
It's crazy that doing what you're supposed to do as a human being gets you noticed.
Parents dont raise their kids like this anymore
I lost my wallet with my ID all of my cards, an important business card from someone, a $100 bill in it, a photo of my deceased pet, and the wallet was SUPER special to me!! It was given to me my first valentines day ever with my longterm partner....but but guess what...an angel like this guy found it and returned it with everything in it to me 2 days later!!! I cried a little bit. I was devastated bc I knew I lost it in public. Because of good people like this I got my wallet returned.
Everyone lets be like him
The real story is -  were the 2 girls going down on each other while they lived together.  Hell yeah it happened
Stuff like this kinda surprises me sometimes cause I forget this isn't a normal thing to do.
More likely to win the lottery then get money from returning someone's wallet/purse
damn onion cutting ninjas back at it
Hahahaha this guy looks like a drug dealer who arrived on that AUDI lol
Hard to believe this very normal action is praised so highly but then again we do live is a cesspit society.
He deserves that
I would return the purse too if it was her missing purse..
No chance he ever saw that 3k😬…
Kid clearly didn't play GTA, you get more if you keep the purse
As a young generation I got offended when she said “there’s hope for the young generation”
I just found the male version of myself 🤍🤍🤍
Kids of today hey
dude looks like a mug, he probably stole it himself then brought it back for the potential reward.
Adrians Kickback 🤷🏾‍♂️
they should have gave him a three some!
I've helped people I don't know and I always turn down the reward, I'll leave your money on the table. Don't do the right thing out of greed.
Oh booohooo cry about it returned a man’s lost wallet with money inside of it and drove miles o give it to the family . Cause i know what it’s like to lose valuables
Decent kid. Hope he does well in life.
Those words right there, "do the right thing when nobody is watching" is what shows his true character and compassion  for others. This kid was raised right.
He wanted a PH reward 🤭
I feel like all the bad stuff happening tends to overshadow all the good in the world
“There is hope for our younger generation” 🌸 I am praying to God everyday to our Heavenly Father that the world is being saved and filled with the Holy Spirit in the name of Jesus Christ 🧡🥰
The auntie is 🔥 🥵
He never like money because he wanted her. Lol
If God were to put me through that test, i would rather beg than steal
I did that one time I found a guy's wallet that had credit cards debit cards $700 and his wallet driver's license everything and I returned it and they slammed the door in my face
That's great and all.   But I still live by the age-old adage: finders keepers, losers weepers.   You leave behind your property in a public place, it can become someone else's property. Fair and square.
Bro sold….Horificly
damn 3k is alot of a reward
The amount of times I’ve gotten stolen from.. this is beautiful to see. Not many people would’ve done what he did
Sweet!! The right thing to do!
This teen knows wat is Self Respect  He's a gentleman
Plot twist he stole it to begin with 😂
That a boy. Your parents did a great job.
God Bless This young Man 777!
she'd get it
That look like faze rug
His mom raised him right. Good Job Super Mom.
Nah y’all think he meant that 🤣😭😭, he saw how fine she was and took the opportunity
Bravo!!!!!! What an extraordinary kid! ❤️
Love this 💕
It's sad we have to show the good ppl nowadays everything is bad in the news
Approaching$20k........still not enough.  $26 with fees is $29.90.  Please help if you can.
Much respect for this young man. He's been  raised right. I hope his generation will learn from this. May God bless him 🙏🏼
Jesus loves you He is coming soon
Finally, some positive news.
finest foo ever
Great now the world knows this kid has $3000
Phhh he fumbled👀
What a good soldier. Respect🫡
Most people say “We need more people like him..”  No.  “We need to be like him” - Someone Very Wise.  Edit: Thanks I didn’t think it would get this many likes lol but “Be a good person it’s easier then pretending to be one ☝️”
What a gentleman.
I work with juveniles everyday and I wish more kids would be like this one
Good on the young man, but also good on his mother for instilling a sense of self-awareness in him.
Plastic surgery yuck. Typical cali
We need more people like this in the world
looks like there nephew no cap
Wow we need more kids like him, if he was my kid I would be so proud of him what a precious soul❤️
Rare feel good story.  Either way, bravo to you young man
0:08 No more.
So refreshing to hear and see something good
and they had a threesome with him after. THE END
What a great young man
Love it. Why can't the main stream media report more things like this? Sorry I forgot. Their job is to keep you in fear all the time.
is it only me or does the place actually resemble the hood from GTA San Andreas !!!
Oh ok so now I cant even judge youngster by how they dress, fantastic.
Nice
Returning a worthless purse, this is unreal, wow
Why does he look like a mexican eminem 💀
Man, nothing better than seeing a good deed rewarded. I've never experienced it💀 but it's always good to see it happen to others.
Brilliant 👏,  well done young man,
this is great
Good boy God bless him 🙏🙏
sry but why does her friend looks like the sister of the bogdanoff brothers? wtf xD
Good lad!
wish there were more like him instead of the selfish , violent , brat entitled zombies roaming the streets today
AMO ❤️ 🎯 💥 …….
If you put a guy like this in the office instead of the trash people usually elects, the world would be q much better place
what goes around comes around good and bad
amo estos videos,hijos de pardres latinos haciendo lo que sus abuelos le enseñaron a sus padres.
ehrenmann
I watched something positive today, finally. Cheers!
Many whites do that and there is no fundrasing for him.
Respect from Germany for this Man!
“Theres hope for out younger generation” thats sad and good at the same time
Came up on a  bag. Karma is real. Good karma is the best
3k for returning a purse,  they must be minted
It would've took one look at the ID picture. I would have been OMW to that address as well
It’s funny cause he’s probably the one that took it and he’s getting all this love…
Hmpff ..
he got dripp
His mom must be very proud
Eliana is fine
Okay but imagine opening a bag u jus stole to find no money but looking at the license and seeing a bad Latina, 👀 we all know what we decision we’re choosing 😭
He looks like a badass gangster who bullies and kills people but he's not like that.
He probably stole it lol
I hope he runs for office some day.
Good man.
you know damn well why he drove there ;)
👍
amazing kid, good deeds never go unrewarded
Everything is fine. But it's sad to see that all she and her friend could offer was money to that good looking young man.
Sad world were we have to make videos of stuff that should be normal
He probably thought the girl on the licence was hot and he might have a chance if he returned her purse
There is a hope for this world
Nice
Mans been watching too much Dhar Mann
wow
Jokes on them, he's the robber.
I figured anybody would do something like this lol- me and my parents have stumbled across a few wallets now and then and each time we tried to find who owned them just so we could return them.
People have trouble doing the right thing when everybody is watching😩 so good for him 👏🏽
The reward was okay... Could have been higher
He drives an Audi. He didn't need whatever was in the purse anyway. Next.
I remember when I was younger I found a wallet in the middle of a crowd street, there was like 800 so I check the ID and the lady were leaving in the next street where I was leaving so I brought it to the house and the daughter receive it, she started crying saying thank you because her mom was too old, she couldn’t hear good and she was almost blind, I left and I went home, a couple hours after they ring the doorbell and there was this lady with her mom and they just didn’t say thank you but the old lady gave me 200, I didn’t want to receive it because I only wanted to do something that was right but they insist so much so I took it and the blessed me… now I had the notice that this pretty old lady die…  I do this because I love to help and I hope this lady is resting in peace 😇😇
A-Rod ayyyy atta boy
Lepo
looks like a g , acts like a gentle , what a little nice mf
He hoped for something other then 3k im sure!
This is like superman saving the kid from his dad abusing him and them being like "we needed you" him saying "no you didn't.." rings the same to me. Just be good people
imagen if all of us could be like this boy the world could be the best place like some African village
my bae where he at cuz Ik damn well he’d treat me right
Dunno where you live... but this is actualy Normal in our Country ^^ America is just the worst if this is something special .. ^^
Ain’t no hope for gen z this world screwed
*normal behaviour in Western Europe happens in America…….🎉 🎉 🎊 ‘we’re number 1. Make a news story. Give him money’
Smh
They really gave him the money? XD
lmao why he look like he's the one who stole the purse tho
Always encourage people to do good.  Keep it up dude.
W
Very nice video!
my guy clearly saw the picture on the license 😅
bro it ain't a big deal he returned a purse💀
Step 1 steal purse Step 2 give it back Step 3 repeat over 300 times Step 4 be miljonair
Great dude
GOD is good..
I hope he doesn’t get shot n killed for his money because his face is plastered all over social media now
Adrian you rock! (So does your mom 😉)
yeah - why didn't they invite him inside :I) he is a delicious young boy - for both of those chicks
the little acts of kindness can just change some ones life.
This why you never judge somebody by their looks
good young man
This was a one time thing the youth be messing up alot
i got the saddest ad before this video
He should be on the newspaper.
Be the change you wanted to see. Good job young fella! We need more people like this in every community.
He was latino so that explained why he did it good boy👍
Man is trying to complete the side quests to level up before the boss fight
Wonderful that good people still exist
Lol. Just because the kid dresses like a degenerate, everyones "SooOoOoo ImPrEsSed!!" He subverted expectations. The kid just did what any decent person would do, if a grown man wearing normal clothes showed up and returned the purse nobody would bat an eye.
he’s leng
15 years ago, I lost my wallet in a club, but someone returned it to the counter, although the cash inside was gone (~$50), I'm still thankful to the person till this day. It had my IDs, credit cards and SSN card. Not saying it's okay to take the cash inside, but it's what it is.
I tell you right now to all you clueless people. Yeah I hope his intentions were pure but he saw a picture of her friend and was like yeah I returning this and hopefully slide in her DMs. This man played it well 😂
I don’t know why I’m constantly distracted and can’t take my focus away from the all the Botox on her face 😟. I pity her
He did the right thing I know if I lost my wallet or something like that I would hope someone would return it it’s just proof that not everyone in this world is bad. We need more people like him good job
Eliana should have made a man out of him.  that would have made for a much better story.
Imagine being on the news because you returned a pursue to the owner.
Imagine being on the news because you returned a pursue to the owner.
Very nice video!
did you know that inside edition is actu-
Good for him
Another great example of why not to judge somebody by their looks.
May Allah guide this young man to the straight path. His Fitrah (innate goodness) should be protected.
W man
I hope who’s reading this gets blessed and has a good day and gets closer with God
These is proof that god is truly with us all.
Is their really.
Good man! Totally deserved that reward! 👍
Don’t judge a book by its cover
he’s fine ash🧎‍♀️
I love how this is something not normal in the US.
Wow so proud of this young guy, good job well done. Keep it up.
That is what’s called “integrity.” Great job for the young man.
What a good kid!
Thank you for sharing my friend
Simon that’s what Raza does! Props ese
Dont judge a book by its cover
this is such an important lesson to not judge a book by its cover.
Too bad he is in the small percentage the other percentage would post on tiktok that they found a purse
does a basic human act, gets on the news 🤣🤣🤣 what the hell happened man
Brodie just wanted to hit
he was hoping for some milf action
I'm more shocked this happened in Cali of all places
I will never forget the day when I found a wallet at the supermarket and gave it to an employee.     _Yes, I didn’t steal money or credit inside it._
I think this guy is happy now with these hot 2 sexy panthers lol😃🔥
Grand Theft Auto scenario when Franklin returns stealed purse🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Honestly.  They should start a GoFundMe for his college education
He didn't need her purse just her personal/credit card information
so nice very very very nice!!!!
To be honest I think the majority of people would do this… if not then at least they would just leave it where they found it. Maybe my area is different but it’s actually really rare for people to steal stuff around here. I went 5 years without locking my car before someone broke in
I’m so proud of him 💙
Wow amazing very inspiring
sad to know that this should be a normal thing but isn‘t bad bad humanity
My cats going crazy wtf
He find the bag and google the person, finds some pictures and decide to leave it to her in hope of getting laid. He went off with his moped, give her the bag and didnt get anything. Just a poor day in this poor teenager life.
Lamp
Bro is waiting on the door like for his next interview
Wow but when they commit a crime
cuz that's what heroes do.
Appearance’s may be deceiving.
It is up to $19,000 on the 4th of August! Amazing!!
we need stuff like this on the news more. Not just negativity
If just all the boys where like him 🫣
Integrity….good on his mom
Awe! God bless this boy! And great job Mom & Dad! I wish there were more people like that around. I want them to be my neighbors!
The kindness is beautiful on both sides but only in USA could this be a news story. In both countries I have lived this is completely normal.
quack
🙌
I have done something similar, why haven't I ended up in the news 😂
he do be fine tho..
Amazing! Good for him kudos to him for doing the right thing! When you do the right thing God reward you when you do the bad thing he takes your rewards and bad things happen down the line! Well the store is so great it almost wants me to send him $50!  L O L
“The true character of a man, is what he does when no one else is watching
Don´t say "We need more people like that", BE like that first.
The lady on the right is a pretty as all hell
If every kid was raised like him the world would be a better place  love from Ireland 🇮🇪🍀❤️
I'm disabled because of that.
Generous af lmao
We still have some goods kids and parents left in the world!  Hurrah!
Kid is doing side quests everyday 😂 he really is the main character
there is still hope for humanity. glory to him
❤️
Young cityzen on civilized moral behaviour is refreshing to see!Let this be example to all greedy heads,he clearly knows Lord is watching and strict!
He he didn’t want $. I know that’s not what I would’ve wanted 😈
He look like a gangster in a block😁 but a gangster with a heart of gold...I'm impressed... godbless you your parents must've been so proud of you....
Plot twist they know each other and split the go fund me
Yeah right, he saw how she looked on that DL and was hoping to score some Latina milf for the night
Damn they can get it
Wow
The goat frfr 💯
😊😅😅😢😢
If that were a black dude he would have been shot right outside the porch for trespassing and theft.
Good man
What if Johnny sins returned that purse.
Very honorable !!!!
I'm going to start leaving purses on the cart like what happened in this situation and see how many of them will be returned. I see so many people in the comment sections saying they need to be more people like this! so I'm going to set up experiments like this to see how many of you really will go this far and return a purse/bag back to their owner.
Great job young man.
cool
Don’t judge by looks
3k for just someone returning a bag oh come on
Good one 👍 👏 money is well deserved. Yes sucks losing your phone it's so personal.
People like him remind me that I also need to do better not only for myself but for the people around me.
It’s good to see that we still have Good Samaritans in this tragic world still, Proud to see that he has done the right thing🫶🏽.
Awaome
I saw in an article a guy found Manuel neuer wallet in his taxi after driving him somewhere then he found €800 in it he spent €400 or something of his own money to drive to neuer manager and gave him the wallet and got a football shirt as a thank you … he deserved better
0:05 that looks like the car from gta
WE NEED MORE OF THAT GOOD JOB YOUNG MAN  A1
Lawful Good - driving to a woman’s house to return a lost purse. Lawful Neutral - Seeing the purse and going on with your day.  Lawful Evil -  Seeing the purse and stealing it.   This is not "human decency"
That’s a g right there. The world notices what you do without you knowing it.
i just wanna know how he figured out the address lmfao
Almost 19k already! Guess that's something he won't forget that fast
He looks mean and evil but he's actually a really nice and good person
We need more good people like Adrian in this world
Amazing 💕
Probs fk all worth in that purse
Homie was trying to smash for sure 😂 he saw her ID pic 😂
yo hes fine and a good person?🤭
POV: he got the 3k from the purse
*Doesn’t help to say “I wish more people were like this” just start by saying I should be like this. Then the world could be a better place, yes*
This is normal here in Norway
Yeah we need more people like him

It seems so spectacular that people would bring back a lost purse.. ? Everybody in Germany would do that. It's common sense.
Damn what a great young man! Very cool
Its sad that this is news worthy. Everyone should do that.

Hi
That is a man.
If I am honest, if I'd find a purse/bag i'll give it back when there is something in it with the owners name/address if there's not I keep the money haha
I would do that if I got 3k as well 💀
The son who all parents want him 🤍🤍🤍
He dous have some good karma for sure now
Da hoes gon love dis
Maybe he didn’t want to be on social media ? Think before you post everything online
❤️❤️❤️
3k for giving something back to the person who owns it!!! So sad that this "act" is even considered a big deal😮‍💨
Ke viva la raza. My mom told me the same thing. Actually that what all Mexican moms would say.
Why record it?
RESPECT 100+
What a good foo
what a duck lips has this girl
Man of respect.
And he fine? Broooo
God has blessed you,through this young man. Prayers for all,in Jesus name,mighty to save. A-men' 🌹
Conclusion? Go steal a purse and then return it, as the one who caught a thief, for potential greater reward.
I handed £25k to an old fella that dropped it about 10 years ago.
Good Samaritan. You'll just never know...
i bet he bought a dragon lore and a karambit doppler.
*HOW SAD IS THAT!* This only happened because it's *extremely rare* that today's youth's moral values would ever return this woman's purse.
The result of good parenting
His moms advice was spot on! Doing what’s right when no one is watching shows true character.
Central cee is that you😂😂?
Is that a fkn birkin???
I wonder what else bro got
That's just normal behavior here in Finland, basically almost everything gets returned
Your so lucky
He probably wanted to smash lol. he saw her id or something🤣
I found a purse at a bus station filled with money when I was younger and really needed money. I handed it in. Most people I told the story to said I should have kept it. I found it really depressing everyone was so damn cynical about the whole thing. It is really touching this guy returned the purse and the ladies saw the importance of rewarding that.
Latinos ❤️ . That s how our moms raised us
PLOT TWIST:   he was the robber
Dude was trying get her number lol 😂
Not me
Imagine he looked through the purse first and didn't feel the need to steal abs then gets 3k
good man
I swear San Diego always have good ppl most of them
Boomer comment section typing with index finger headass💀
Everyone talking about we need more people like him   Make the move and be like him
Good kid.
Awesome Guy! Parents raised him right..
❤️👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
bravo young man raised right, this makes me happy he got the reward,i hope he took his mom out to dinner
and he sholl was fine😂🤷🏽‍♀️
Way to go!!
545
Boy look like he stole it
Kinda weird that this is treated as something special in the USA...   I've found a couple of (smart)phones over the years, returned all of them.  Besides one person, I can tell that all owners where very happy when I returned them their phone...  The one that I don't know if he was happy, was a drunk... So pushed his phone in his mailbox, to avoid having to talk to him...
The donate is now by 19k 😂👍
How Did He Know Its Hers Though
Idk if I would have done that but good job
This is actually really wholesome
i did this with my friends like 4 years ago. we were riding our bmx bikes across town and came across a table at a supermarket with a purse on it. we waited by the table for 10 minutes to see if anyone would get their purse. we soon realized that the person FORGOT their purse on that table. so we grabbed the purse with i'd guess like 400 dollars in cash and we didnt steal it but we looked at the ID and found their house, went to the house and returned it. lol. the lady gave us 20$ to split between the 3 of us.  id say its worth it, because what if you were the person that left their purse with the wallet, money, ID, debit cards in it. Idk about you, but i would freak out if i left all my stuff somewhere available to any theif that wanted to steal it.  so yes, always be the nice person, do not steal, return it instead.
Bruh.. They talk too much
Lolll
Nah what this a neva happen in nyc 😭
I returned a lost wallet once to this rich guy. He was driving a lambo when he came to pick up the wallet. All i got was $20
Ok you guys need to stop saying “we need more ppl like this” and actually become someone like this
This is news in america? Lmao thats sad af
Genuinely a great guy, even though he doesn't seem like he would be by appearance.
he’s fine asf
This is so normal in some cultures that people would just tell you thank you, but I guess in US it’s very uncommon
If the license picture was an old fat dude would he have still returned it?
That’s so funny cause his actions say one thing but his look say another 🤣🤣
He’s a g
His mom is raising a star for the future
My moosum (grandpa) taught me the same lesson many many moons ago...do the right thing even if you think no ones is watching you! But remember, Creator/God🙏 is watching, someday you may need a blessing is return...😇
Title has to be: "Gets reward from other people."
“fine young man”😭😭
This teaches everyone that what gone around comes around always do the right thing and good things will happen
Exodus 20:7 says: “Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain
We have gotten to the point of financially rewarding people for doing the right thing...... That's how I know that our society has collapsed.
them lip injections were a mistake XD
Is that central cee
Don't judge a book by its cover
Maybe there was nothing valuable in the purse
I did the same and was expecting 3k reward but just got thank you 😓
Bruh I guarantee this dude only returned it cause this dude took one look at this her face on ID saw that she was attractive and just tryna bagg 🤣
Atta boy! Young St Francis. 👍
damn america is a really crappy place if the make a whole news about returning a purse
Hero🏆
Nor a big deal, in Arabic countries we always do it
To all the younger chicos be the example
Only 3k? Come on y'all, that's even more disrespectful than "stealing" a purse.
Nah but he’s so fine
Karma is real guys
Awesome kid
Probably searched and didn’t find no money… 😂
I bet sum head would of done the job
Most people give missing stuff back to others. Maby not in USA 💪🏿
hes pushing a audi he dont need to steal lol
W Human
Probably took the cash first then returned it for more cash by reward.  Can't always judge a book by it's cover but he's pretty much dressed and tatted like a gang member.  You're mom should have guided you a bit on appearances.
You reward by thanking not by paying.  Give wrong message.
There's not much hope for our younger generation despite this sorry to say.
Kids a stud. Another strong man in the making. Mom raised him right.
This was good and all, but this is using the ”news mentality”;  For every 1 good thing on the news, there’s 99 bad things. The good thing now seems _extremely_ good, because of ”well it’s 99% bad stuff that happens”
We act like this is crazy but this is normal behaviour America.
What a great dude
To be honest, I do stuff like this all the time, because my parents raised me the same way.  I'm just hoping karma rewards me like it did this kid.  Maybe not all at once, but in the long run.    Then again, I wouldn't mink 3 grand either, haha.
So proud of you young man! You will go far in life!!  Your Mother trained you right.  Hope all you dreams come true!!!   😘🦩
bro sold the bag
he’s soo fine
Great video BTW!!
He did the right thing anybody should do. We need more people like this.
I’d return that as well she’s fine as hell lol
Meanwhile I live in a village where it's usual to find your wallet in your mailbox after you got a little to drunk and lost it at the party last night.
I’ve done this before, wheres my 3k at ?
ok i pull up
watch hes the one who stole it 💀
Nice boy and kind owner of the bag, too.
Take that quote Spidermans Uncle Ben!
He really is a FINE young man 😉
*Giving is the key to living life of abundance blessings.*
Właściciel gangu rodrigeza
no there's no hope.
That's normal in Switzerland lol
God bless!! 💕🙏🏼
Remember if you live in the US and find someone's belongings at 12pm and you take it home with you and return it the next morning some cop will crawl out of the woodwork to try and charge you for theft.
hes kinda…😊😊
Kudos to his mom for raising a good kid and kudos to the ladies for rewarding him!
Shoulda let him smash
yess if i were ever to find a purse i would go haunt the person from who it was LOL
He’s a real one ☝🏿
That young man changed my outlook in modern society, Bendiciones Adrian!!!
Short vid
W
Good deed camera and very very very good luck gets you 3,000 dollars
He is a role model for all American citizens
Bro was like it's common sense it's not that deep lol
see don’t stereotype. this is so nice
By doing what is right not wrong, this young man has reminded us all that there is still good in our great country of milk & honey, the USA.
This young man did what many can't/wont do, the right thing not the wrong. Good for you young man.
what’s his @ 😱😱😱
Plot twist: He stole the bag in the first place
Nice one kid!
but he looks like a gang member.
actually i wouldn't recommend you to touch anything that doesn't belong to you. because first it can be a set up, second the owner might accuse you of stealing something from the purse/bag. and you will be in a serious trouble.
in japan, korea or russia this is happens all the time. you can leave a suitcase on the railway platform in china and no one will ever touch it. because it's a crime.
i am so happy to him  he helped a hot milf  maybe he won to many thing lol
0:09 the heck did you expect from our generation robbing shooting
good choice man 👍
It is insane to appreciate this with all pation representimg this situation. It is too rare for good to happen in the modern sociaty . Back then , it was a common things
there is one say in Confucianism very similar to this phase. 'A gentleman should be cautious where no one sees, and fear and awe where no one can hear. Even when it is hidden, it will be discovered by others, and the subtleties will be obvious, so the gentleman should be careful when he is alone.' (是故君子戒慎乎其所不睹，恐懼乎其所不聞)
Lol this happened twice to me, didn't know this is a news story.
So, giving things you found back to their owner isn't quite normal?
Unfortunately, there aren't many decent people around anymore. Good job young Samaritan. 👏
if i did this i would get a tap on my shoulder
They gave him 3k and a happy ending like Brazzers vibes does 😂
Good people
I drove for one hour to return a wallet and got $10…
man was hoping the woman was hot and he'd get a hookup out of it
Isn’t this like normal?😂
lawd he fine as hell
we all know why he returned it 😂
Well the aunt 🤷...
Good kid, Thanks Adrian!
He the one who stole it
He may look like a bad kid but he's a great kid all I'm gonna say 🥰
It's big deal to return a purse in America 😂   I can tell you don't have a lot of good people out there
There is 0 hope.
they say there's hope for the younger generation as if our generation is so problematic when in reality its the older people making all these problems we now have in the world
Jesus is coming soon amen 🙏🏾
he’s so fine omg
Right now (2022-07-27 23:44 UTC) the fundraiser reached $18,780.00
Would this still be a news story if it was an elderly white woman returning the purse?
Yet when I return things I only get five dollars. That's why I started keeping things. I once found $1,200. Happy day
Thank you for posting about something good. Super proud of this young man and his mom!!
Dope
I found a wallet onces and thru the license I took it back to the owners, I knocked on the door and the owner opened up the door I told him I found his wallet he said oh thanks took the wallet and closed the door, I wasn't expecting no reward but it was just weird how he just took it said thanks and closed the door on me didn't even ask me were I found it but I'll rather do the good thing and get good karma back instead of bad karma
I would’ve took the money then asked if I could hit
What an awesome young man. This is dope.
❤️
He only brought it back cuz he saw the id and wanted to tapp as payment
What hope 😂, they tryna normalize soft people and accept legtbq ppl and advertise sin and deny the Lord, there is no hope but God
Salute to this man
There is nothing inside that purse that's why he returns.. Cuz his face doesn't look like a good guy..
This is totally normal in Japon et it should be just normal everywhere in the world but unfortunately this is not the case.
Someone give him a good job and hug .
staged stories?
Lmfao
he cute asf
When we live in a world where a return of stolen property is a big deal ... it makes me sad .. I did this sort of thing many times in my life.
If he'd be the only human to meet the aliens I wouldn't be ashamed.
The young man saw the image of a gorgeous milf on the id and thought he might get something out of it
i want people to pay attention to the clothes he is wearing mainly
🔥
Not bad
wow..
America dont have that kind of sense to do dat. London people is better than Americans
Nice one homie 👌
Good for him. I would’ve took somethin out that mf and say it was missin when i found it
he only returned it cause the girl was hot
Good people
Definitely seen the milfs iD 😂
Great kid
Found a purse 3 years ago before work early and decided to get it to the police since the home of the guy was pretty far away and i was with my bike. At first an officer got angry with me for putting my bike at the wrong place at the police station (that one is on me) and the officer inside got angry with me for bringing it to the police and not to the district courts mailbox (i had no idea you can do that stuff, but appearently its the right thing to do). Felt pretty awful afterwards for doing "the right" thing. :/  Funfact: A week after the press of the police published an article about "good deeds in our town" about two boys finding a phone and bringing it to the police and how great and awesome this is.  But still, i got a call from the owner and he thanked me a lot and thats all that matters right?  Story from germany :)
That’s nice. I returned a lost purse to a lady once only to have her accuse me of stealing it and called the cops on me!
I bet they're friends now. That's exactly why he did it
He may have did it because the woman was beautiful when he checked the ID.
hero !
Good kid it gives you comfort and hope for the future generations.
Good kid, hope his mom is proud & I wish him all the success
Black HAIR chick got some DSL'S
If you think about it, its actually pretty sad that this video has almost 15.000.000views, like its been sth special. It should be normal to return stuff that isnt yours
at least it isn't as dark as kids getting paid for smuggling drugs across the U.S/Mexico border
What a good kid. This should be the norm. Unfortunately it's often the opposite.
he kinda fine
Don't get the big deal... I have done the same thing. Didn't even get a thank you
Good people exist ! Your great reward will come from above ☝🏾 in the near future you will remember exactly of what you did today .. one day you will lost something and one Good Samaritan will give back to you .. 🙏🏽❤️
Imagine just being a good human and now everyone knows u and what u look like💀
I wouldn’t trust him the way he looks. He looks like he would shoot you in the back.
This is what makes me happy about my youngerlings
Just shows you how important it is to instill good behavior in your child from young
Society is so screwed that a simple situation like this one is getting attention, when this should be the norm. Sad.
Looks like you can't judge a book by it's cover.. I would have assumed that because of how he was dressed with the chains that he was not the type of person who would return the purse.  What does that say? Does it say that a certain type of attire and the look that it represents creates a negative judgment? Yes..yes it does.  When you look the part, you take on the image.
What's his @ tho 👀🔥
Not gonna lie it’s hard to do the right thing sometimes when your stomach is screaming feed me !!!! But you do what you got to do . Sometimes it pays off sometimes it don’t .
How beautiful the world would be if everyone thought like this. Best wishes for his future ❤️
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿 awesome
Feel proud of him 😊
3k? Just let him in for some coffee homie wouldve been in burger heaven
wtf
I feel proud of this young man!
Samerita
"found" sure
He wanted to hit
Kindness making the news is kind of sad actually, like its a rarity or something. its just common sense.
“there’s hope for our younger generation” cannot stand people who think like this
Why can't we see more news stories like this rather than all the bad stuff. Perhaps we would effect people in a positive way more
I'll be like "screw the money I want you! Beautiful young lady" for reall
We don't need more people like him, we need to become like him
What an upstanding young man
Putting our time and effort in activities and investments that will yield a profitable return in the future is what we should be aiming for. Success depends on the actions or steps you take to achieve it.
Always do the right thing, even when no one is watching next dharmann video
GOD WILL BLESS HIM 👼💪✌️
Not all is lost.   ¨An honest man is the noblest work of God.¨  Alexander Pope
nice clickbait and fake just like saving poor animals in india or china
Good young man
"Never judge the book by its cover" .
If this makes the news, America you finished
Respect!
Quantros de amos tantes puli tantes puli amas
in denmark and sweden they wouden show this  unless he was a muslim or black,,,,,
This is actually so sad...
man of god, god’s plan 👑🙏💯
This is great. Sadly very rare.
Great kid!
This is considered news worthy while in Japan there's thousands of lost and found storage centers bursting out of found objects and cash. They're taught in school since kindergarden that they should never take someone else's belongings. We could learn a thing or two about their education system.
Good on him but its kinda sad a simple small act of kindness is so rare it goes viral and gets 10+ million views
More people need to be like this in this world
Wish good like this was more common, that outstanding young man did an incredible thing.
Какой хороший мальчик !
3k for bro returning the purse. i mean yeah he did the right thing but 3k?
“the good samaritan” 💀🔥
“Always do the right thing, even when no one is watching.” Big brother is watching you, man. He was being watched by a security camera. (Kinda a joke)
He is a Real Hero.
dis one proves that our parents is our best teacher
The lady in the back is an illegal for sure. Just from her accent
The go fund me is almost at 20k now, good deeds do in fact go a long way.
I suppose I'd also return the purse because it felt right and I'd do it because I had nothing else to do lol.
I found a quarter on the ground one time at the supermarket and used it on the bubble gum machine.  Damn thing stole my quarter no gum.
The dude home invaded her house the next day
I found a phone on the ground once and called the most recent number to return it, turns out it belonged to a pizza delivery guy lol, he brought a trunk full of pizzas and wouldn't take no for an answer. Luckily I was living in a dorm at the time because I needed all that help eating those pizzas.

Like mom and like son!
Cool mom and cool son!

Plot twist: he stole the purse to return it and hope for this outcome
All these cops judging books by their covers. Good Kid 👍👍👍👍
Great Lord bless him and his proud mom. I wish them and you ALL THE BEST.
he brought that mf back cuz she bad asf😂
Me about to start looking for purses and wallets everywhere I go😏:
Amazon is out I know amazing woman feed homeless people went shealo in her life leave father son who not to her I love her out
Karma will reward you, if you find a wallet, return it with everything that came with it. Even if there’s no physical reward, know you did the right thing and that you’re a good person.
Prob there’s no money inside, and saw how to owner looked like from the ID, the boy is smart, wanted a step mother and som scenario…. Reward with sex
the reality is he prolly stole it noticed there was like $100 in it ,  then saw a reward for 3k for it and said damn why steal $100 when i can return it pretend to be the good guy  and get $3000
There's good news going on all the time. Good news that can influence the collective consciousness in a positive way, and set good examples unlike the current mainstream media funded by a bunch of biIIionaires who try to influence our collective consciousness negatively attempting to pit us up against each other so we can't achieve unity in unconditional love.
so no ones gonna point out that shes a milf and that may possibly might maybe be a factor
Always do the right thing
3k reward probably the purse costed x3 times more and both of them seem rich so a good deed gets rewarded
Finally a quality reward for a good deed lol
Looks like Paul Denino But he wouldn't bring it back haha
"Theres a hope for our younger generation" - No, there isn't. And stop smiling, looking ridiciulous.
"Breaking news: Someone has been kind!" Welcome to 21st century America.
What I don't get is why there's a video on this. It isn't a "woah, that's heroic" moment, it should be NORMAL.
Homie had a heart.
Good dude!
That’s awesome! Now you can buy a belt for your kids pants.
Love my Hispanic people always so kind and good hearted
Right thing to do
God always watching you.
2 years ago i found a phone and returned it and in exchange i got a "Thanks".
🤍🤍made my day!
Last year when I was in Turkey I left my wallet at cashier's. About ten minutes later a local caught up with me saying something like sir you left your wallet. I was both embarrassed and grateful to that  gentleman. I thanked him profusely, he just smiled and went away.
That’s how we all should do, for the sake of our beautiful reality!
I'm confused though. Everybody was surprised her purse was found? Like they didnt know it was missing? Or what am I missing
Respect young lad
I like the one on the right . Cute 🥰
Amazing how this is something news worthy in America, pretty sad
Yes we do have some good people out in the world still
Er ist ein guter Junge
He returned it because on the ID card she looked hot 😂
This is normal in Finland
God bless his parents!  Great job, to the parents!  Oh and God bless the young man!  👏👏👏👏👏🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🖐
Okay but, isn't this just the normal thing to do? Good guy and all, but is it like a 1 out of a million occurrence to do something normal in California?
The fact that this is news... says lots about the United States of North America..
this is the NORMAL nothing other
Great to see good people like this but sad that it's a big deal
Finally a happy story
y’all need to stop saying, “we need more people like him.” and just say, “i need to be more like him.”
Thats a good young man.  Proves you cant always judge a book by its cover.  Tattoos, jewelry, clothes, might make you think one thing when in fact that is the kind of young man I would love to know.  Wish he lived near me.  Would love to know a young person like that.  With all the bad stories, this is a great one to share.
That man had tegridy
Yea I’m gonna make SURE I have a good relationship with my kids and teach them the RIGHT WAY 😤💯 proud of u lil bro for doing what’s right when no one was watching
Don't say we need more people like this in our world because there is you just be one of them
plot twist he got all the credit card info wrote down
I like how she got others to pay for his reward 🤣
This used to be normal thing to do, now its shoking
His go fund me was at 18,000 bucks last time I checked. Good for him.
and he fine
It's a dude like him that you'd want to be a cop. Not the current crop of a$$holes that patrol our streets now.
the fact that is news make me more happy to live in Switzerland
Can you imagine deciding to return someone's purse and having to hear your entire generation insulted thousands of times as a result? I'm proud of this guy, and I'm happy he got a good reward, he deserves it. But even when you know you're being treated as an exception, it feels lousy to have to listen to someone telling you a group you're part of sucks.
In fact, this is a very sad story.. Why? At least because what this kid did, everyone should do it, every day. But the reaction of these two ladies was as if he had done something that is simply incomprehensible, something that is very rare today, and it is very, very sad...
Good kid.
Love this
Plot twist ….. he stole the purse
The Aunt is a thoughtless moron.
This is beautiful. There's hope in this world after all
Awesome but dont say 'there is hope' like that its just demotivating for other kids listening
NO HOPE at all for this generation sorry... RARE RARE RARE
He saw the driving license, so he tought: damn im tryna get some
W dude
Honestly I don’t like many people nowadays this kids age but this speaks volumes I hope this kid the best
But woman can steal purse in America  I left in bathroom my purse and woman with very expensive purse stole my purse with money
Great kid. Great parents.
Why and how is this video so popular All it is a guy finding a purse and then giving a purse to the owner, and yeah you could say he did something good but like why does it have 14 million Viewers, how so much and why so much
I love stories like this. This young man is an outstanding member of his community. He will be a great parent one day. It's so refreshing to see someone from the younger generation have a strong moral compass.
W man
this is normal !!
Honestly, this dude kinda looks like a thug so kinda gets me to realize I shouldn't mentally stereotype like that
He saw the license picture and went on a mission
This is how brazzers start
Go ead lad ! Good on him. Need more lovely young men like him in our world ! Thank you for this video ! Nice bit of brightness in this dark world right now
Everyone ain't bad.
good price for a 1,000,000 dollar Californian home...
Very good young man
Good stuff lil man…..   salute
lol they made a GoFundMe for some guy who brought someone their purse. Weird.
So it is safe to say that he behaved with honor and dignity because of his upbringing? The way he was raised?  OMG!! Don't let that get out! People might start actually believing that good parenting produces good human beings.  What a mad world that would be.
This is news in USA. Where im from this is normal. If you lose your wallet,most likely it will be taken to the police station.
What a cool guy.  Hope we can see more of this.
HABIB???
Latinos helping each other out. God bless them!
this way more people will be encourage to do the right thing
we should donate more money to him so he gets a bright future :) respect
This whole situation is the BEST!
Dead ass probably looked in the purse first lmao. But all around good story
Weird! Had he been a dark skinned boy he probably would have gotten shot
Sad that this is news & not standard behaviour
Everytime I returned a wallet or purse all I got was a thank you. So I stopped
Congratulations to the Parents.
The purse owner should check her thyroid
Marlena should check her thyroid
Good kid, gives me hope that humanity isn't doomed after all
GOS IS ALWAYS WATCHING!!!
Sad to see this as something special This should be the norm in a well functioning society
I once made a very almost invisible scratch on the car so left a sorry note on their car.. the guy texted me very thankful, and later proceeded to send me a hefty bill to pay for repainting
Warrior tears at 1:05
I did too. When someone lost the whole purse I try to find her through Facebook search with her id and found her. I contacted and gave her the purse and she rewarded me zero dollar 😝
He’s a good guy🙂
What they dont is that the kid is a leader of a gang call the SD crips. He was actually casting the house out to rob it later. He was last convict for home invasion and 4 speeding tickets. SIKE I lied!! Good for the kid.
oh but you didn't get him to do an interview as he was out gang banging tonight ?
Protect him at all costs
My man had crack for days!
I love stories like this! Thanks for sharing it. Feels good to get some good heart warming stories for a change!
people we need.. the kid has a good future. this would solidify to his mind and set an example
This is somehow, news.
Unpopular opinion: it's all staged to raise some money
This should be considered normal behavior it’s weird that people think it’s weird
There’s hope with the next generation. A boomer would’ve pocketed it.
“There’s hope for our younger generation!” Ummmmmm I’m gonna have to counter that and say absolutely not. I’m sorry but my generation is filled with nothing but dumbasses.
Well done to this young man
Need more good people like this
plot twist: he stole the purse
This young man is setting an example of how we all should be. I am proud of him and his parents for raising a respectable young man for this world!
You see when you have morality
When me and my mom were on welfare some kid returned her purse, i remember he had like a punk rocker style and was super nice. Didnt have money to give him but gave him my number and told him if he ever needed any help with w.e to call me up.
Curious. It's the kind of kid conservatives would happily defend being killed for wearing "hood clothes" and a baseball hat backwards and having dark complexion. Turns out clothes and ethnicity don't define personality.
Funny is that America makes a fuss of it at all. If that happens to you in Japan it would be utterly surprising, if you would not get it your stuff back one way or annother. But all bodies of people have somewhere their virtue and vice.
No matter how many items I return to people , they never reward , in fact they get angry that some lowlife was touching the item .
The fact that a youth doing the morally right thing is newsworthy says all you need to know about western society
I guess it's quite uncommon in USA..but here in HK people always go out their way to return lost property.  I have lost phones/wallets many times and they always get returned.
If i return that purse i just want a kiss from her she's hot
They obviously fancy him lol
He was just tryna hit after seeing her drivers licence lets be honest
I thought that was the normal thing to do. I didn't realise you could get paid to return items. Haha
Good job
Step one steal a purse step two bring it back and say u found it somewhere    step three go to jail ???  Ez money glitch thank me later
Scandinavians be like "why is this even news?"
I wish I had this lady’s luck.   I’m more the guy where a birthday present my girlfriend orders me with notes from her and her son is stolen from my apartment lobby and the carrier didn’t notify either of us at any point.
thats cool and all but did they really just opened a fundraiser to reward someone? 💀 thats just weird
how df you even lose that sack of potatoes
I wish the news would show more good news like this.
Plot twist he was the one who took the purse but realized it has nothing good in it so gave it back for money
For a normal person doing the right thing actually brings a certain kind of satisfaction, unlike any other. You do it for yourself as much as the other person.
Only $3K 😀
I get pepper sprayed for doing this and I'm white
bro steeled the purse and didnt find money inside , brought it back. - Their is hope for this generation - ahahahhaa brooo
Now, the challenge is to maintain it over years to come.
What he did was absolutely amazing but this kind of behavior should be the norm in society. Because it's not, we celebrate it when it happens, which is kind of sad.
Hes cute too. If i was the lady id let him in and give him a good time
“Do the right thing even when no one’s watching“  Posts video on internet…
0:06 : "Theres hope for our younger generation!"  That didn't age well.
That's real now!$
That really is what up dawg
good
This was normal thing to do..
He stole it first and now he's come, to give it back :D
Nice Dude 💪🏻
Rare to find honest person in America, he deserved a medal.
What a wonderful thing to do. God bless you.
Huge respect to that guy.
He definitely saw the ID and went there for a sneak peak😏
Awesome human and mom
Anyone else would’ve probably kept it and stole the money he probably got more money then he would if he stole it so that’s why you always do the right thing even if you don’t get paid
That kid definitely stole it then felt guilty and returned it....
This is great reward for this young man.
salute to the parents of this good samaritan..
W human
Typical intro to xxx movies
I’m guessing there wasn’t anything in the purse lol 😂
All I have to do is dress up as a hispanic possibly gang-affiliated teen and find a purse to return and I'll make easy money due to the low standards society holds me at based on my appearance
Bless his heart, hope he leads a happy and healthy life
This makes news in the US?
That boy was raised right!!!
honesty is something that need to be rewarded 👍👍👍👍
Anyone else think the thumb nail looks gta esk
👏🙌👏🙌👏🙌👏
❤️
I definitely wouldn't have accepted all that money
Fine Young man 😭😭
18.745 $   right now
Bro was jus tryna hit☠☠
he prolly saw the license and was like, dang this baby momma is hot.
How nice! What a sweet boy! 🌺
This taught us a lesson to not judge a book by its cover !!
Nice and all but honestly doing the right thing should be a normal thing, anyone who would have kept the purse is a thief? Not saying he is not a good kid - he is - but still, with the gofundme they took it a little too far in my opinion.
I found a wallet with what looked like rent money in it.  I returned it to the security office at my college.  Months later, I lost my wallet after taking rent money out..went back to where it dropped out of my pocket(im in a wheelchair so it slid out cuz i was sitting) a sketchy looking meth head had passed me in the area I dropped it.  So when I went back of course it was gone and he was rich for a day lol Karma ain't real.  You just gotta do the right thing no matter what.  Good for this young fella.
aw poor kid. He definitely stole it based on his image.
I live in daygo and didn’t even know about this
so for you Americans, not stealing from someone's bag and giving it back is something not usual that deserves rewards? damn it the lefts did hit you hard
Hood man
101010pleh gnineppah s’tI
bro was trying to smash
Not only does he have a good heart but he’s fine
Ahh my name is Malina 🙂
He's probably the one who stole it to begin with
He was trying to get some booty..lol
dude was cougar huntin thats whats up
He did a good thing very proud of him :)
He must’ve seen Elianas driver license and said damn she fine let me go return this purse maybe I can get her number
soo sweat, now try news
Great story. Good people. Dave Heitman
hurrr durrrrr
That is awesome .
Its so sad what the world has become, but this person shows true hope.
2 basic reasons
Bro looks like the type of guy to defend you in your worst scenario  Nice work Adrian 👍
What a legend
"There's hope for our younger generation.." There's always been hope. The older generation just believe they know better.
Good kid. If only they could all be that smart and respectful.
Bro knew he was finna get rewarded
We Californians stick together 🙏
😂😂😂why reward him ? There's other people who actually did this do you see them getting rewarded 😂😂😂
Another Fake story... let me guess she get up a go fund me page for her self.. I mean for him... I smell a scam. I can't believe people fall for this stuff.
this young man will go far in life
like that one episode of x factor (with jonathan frakes)
People like him definitely deserve some help for the good deed.
Never judge book by its covers!
I just thought of a great scam watching this
Only in America it's a newsworthy story when someone does something remotely decent
Damn how rich is that woman?
Great job young mam
People asked him why he did what he did. So many minds warped
But Neuer the German Goalie gonna give his jersey..
He stoll it in the first place then though i will return it to scope out the house and comeback later to steal more.
Once while at the airport, I found an unattended phone. I was getting late for my flight but wanted to return the phone to the customer service so the person could get his phone back.   I held the phone in front of my body and clearly visible as I walked around looking for the customer service.  Much to my shock, someone from behind grabbed my shoulder and started shouting at me. I was accused of stealing his phone, when my only intention was to return the phone I found to the airport authorities.  Ever seen then, I’ve been afraid to go out of my way to help.
awesome! praise god!!!!!!!
3k can change someone;s life.
You know our society is screwed up when something we used to do all the time is now so rare that it's heralded as heroic lol. Good job kid.
Hello from Russia,how do you do,my dear american's people? This young man a true and strong!He father and mother be proud for him!yes!heis very cool man!  And...  We all not have war,know this! Trust me please!i hope,what you to not have a war!be happy,people!
I would’ve returned it too whoever that friend deserves it
This is what neuer’s taxi driver expected to happen.
Everyone after this video: Mam is this yours ? 👁👄👁 👜
Awesome!
Yall stupid as hell 🤦🏻‍♂️🤣🤣🤣🤣 Ol boy snatched it and brought it back 🤣🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️😄🤷🏻‍♂️
we need more people like this
What a nice young gentleman 💪😎
Good stuff!
Wow
Plot twist: he smash both ladies afterwards.
She said younger generation? She looks like she's in her twenties.
So happy for this young fella
So shines a good deed in a weary world..... _Willy Wonka_
See there is some good in the younger generation. Its called good parenting.
good man
W Guy!
i know the man did a good deed but why did that woman say there is hope for the next generation?
I mean he had  a chance  A small  If i saw the id cards  Would do the Same The Chance is small  But he could had done it with the Moms. It was Close doggg
✊🏾
Just for a purse eh?, im pretty sure he gave them a good dickin and as well. Thats why the big reward.
This guy will be a great person in life .thank you that u R in this world
Heard he bought a gun with that money then went on a bank robbery 😂
Not going to lie I seen his clothes and was like he dresses like a thug or something, not to be mean but this just goes to show that looks do not define the person, also he’s a great person in the UK people do not care I have had plenty of things lost and not returned 😞 wish it could of been him to find it
That guy rich now
Aren’t there some people in America who have go fund me pages bc they need like lifesaving surgery or something (and your country is so backwards you don’t have free healthcare). Surely the people who have donated could find something a tiny bit more important. I’m just saying in the same country where people die bc they can’t afford simple procedures is it really necessary  to give someone 3k because they returned a purse?
if he had known, he would kept it ^^
Plot Twist: They made the whole thing up to get people to give 3k to their gofundme
Noeadays, someone doing the right thing is rewarded 3k on a gofundme.   What a joke
If these comments prove anything, it's that people will find a reason to argue about anything. Smh
Staged.
Plot twist: he stole it from her but got caught by his mother who told him to give it back to her
He looks like he took it home and this Mom told him to return it or she was going to beat his ass.
Good job. Greetings from the netherlands
Awesome 😎
he will have a blessed life
This is like the ultimate don’t judge a book by it’s cover
A true OG.
Plottwist he copyed the Credit card inside the bag
It is very important to motivate youngstaz to behave like.that
this feels like porn script.
its incedible that now adays something like this makes new, its common sense to return the purse, but in the world wer live in you have a better chance of hitting the lottery than getting your wallet back, kudos to the kid and his family rasing him the right way.
He seems like a cool kid 👍👍
“There’s hope for our younger generations”  Shut yo goofy ahh up.
eliana looks like a cross between MARINA and kylie jenner
Thank god police didn’t stop him with that bag and ask him where he got it, you find something call cops you never know could be drugs or gun in bag
Well done young man, keep.going through life like THIS and your do well .👍👍👍❤❤
He is a good man
Someone's watching. God is watching.
Screw the money, I’d take a Bj
“Fine Young Man” 😅
It is striking to me that something that should be considered “normal” to do today is unfortunately special.
LOL like the taxi driver in Germany😅:  In Germany, and beyond,  is making headlines a story that has as protagonist Manuel Neuer, goalkeeper of Bayern Munich and the German national team. The "case" took place a few weeks ago, when the footballer and a friend got into a taxi in central Munich to make a transfer. At the end of the ride, the taxi driver noticed that Neuer's wallet was in the rear seats of the car, with 800 euros in cash, various documents and bank cards. Imagining that he was doing a favor, the man decided to go on a journey to return the wallet to the owner. Not finding him in the last destination where he had accompanied him, the taxi driver headed to the official address of Neuer, driving for 120km.  The taxi driver, who had spent almost 400 euros for that trip, expected something for the "disturbance" or at least that the footballer would offer to pay the gasoline costs. The Bayern captain, on the other hand, would have repaid by sending the taxi driver a shirt of with his name printed from the German champion club.   "Two weeks later I received a Bayern Munich shirt, personalized with his name, but without a dedication or thank-you note. The reward is a mockery. I have four children."
He just wanted to get some folks please don’t be naïve
Integrity. Doing the right thing when nobody is watching
What a fool! ma man went to return the bag and got like 3k and in the bag was like 300k kuuu hahahah why am I not this lucky?🤣
I'm a 60-year-old eight year old vet with cancer and heart problems and diabetes and that is refreshing to see a young person that thinks like that that really gives me belief in humanity
This is what should happen! ❤️  My applause to that teen!
Damn their family is very loving to all come together and want to reward him
Some people would steal the pennies off a dead man's eyes, but this young man is made of stronger,  better stuff. A shining example of decency.
We need more ppl like him!
D Savage came a long way
I'll pretend to lose my wallet, get my son to pretend to be a stranger to return it. Then I'll do gofundme for a reward then split it with him 50/50. A clever ploy indeed.
I don’t get it this is normal in my country
This is how the world is suppose to work. Good job by all involved.
He’s one of the good ones
A momma who truly loves her child will teach them to be kind and choose the path to good without expecting anything. If only there were more families like this 🙏
Why is he dressing like a ganster ? 😒
It’s up to 18,700 as of 7/25/2022
I'm srry but he's fine
One time i found a wallet with 400 bucks and a lot of credit cards in it. I found his adress and went to his house. His reaction wasn't very satisfying but i did the right thing. You'll always feel better if you return other people's stuff, their reaction does't matter
It’s sad that this is considered so rare and amazing that it makes the news. He is acting how everyone should be, but instead he is an extreme rarity.
Normal daily thing on Finland.  Once in a lifetime thing in the USA, and gets rewarded for being a human.
1 in the million people will do that, but if in Japan thats normal
Im my country(I won't tell where) when a person loses something and if a stranger finds it we return it to the owner. It is part of our culture. Just a few months ago me and my friend found someones ID next to the shopping center. We then went to the shopping center and gave it to the security.
good now these women some more money for some more plastic surgeries.
I bet the one on the right is a illegal one. Change my mind
Kid will go FAR -- heart of a champ 🦸‍♂️🔥💯💪
Good job, how other people learn something of this.
Rare breed nowadays. 💯👍👍👍
What a great young man. Proud mama I’m wure
A young Lady in here said of the young man's mom. I'm sure that she's going to get a good chunk of his money fare man the young man is!
What's bad is that a good deed is so few and far between when it happens it makes the news.....just think about that for a minute 🤔
Dude saw her on ID and took his shot
Lovely story - would love to have seen his reaction when he received the reward though!
He thought he will get a happy ending with the return 👌👈👍
Your on your way to good things there young Sir!
Great, Great young man! God bless him and his family.
Faith in humanity restored
This seems like a normal thing, but maybe that's different in the US.
There wouldn't of need to Law, Police, etc. if everyone became like this guy
Great scam! These suckers all fell for it!
I wish I had found that bag
Respect for both of them.
Straight up solid dude.
Do we have todo a gofund me for eevrything these days?  I wish we could cure most sicknesses or at least have medicine ffree across the world over people putting money towards random things, its becoming too common.
That young man will be blessed with richest for doing that, and his mom raised him right.
In Germany he is what we call "Ehrenmann"
Framing
the kind of kid that should get some kind of scholarship (if he needs it) in order to get a good university education for a bright future, or some kind of apprenticeship or internship if he wants to start working right away. He can be great, he has the right attitude, the kind of person that the more opportunity you give him the better he will do.
❤️
Kid was raised right...
Everybody did the right thing. The parents of this young man, the young man himself, both women and their friends. A ultimate win win situation.
It's kinda funny that people say we need people like him. Obviously we do. But they like die out. Look how unstable socienty in the US is. And it gets worse each day.
Plot twist Adrian got jumped for that $3k on the way home
Emezing
Beautiful
I mean, I’ve return someone’s wallet before. Is that the low bar this society has set?
Damn in america they make a news story about anything don't they?
I gotta go. My friend will steal some handbags and I‘ll bring them back stonks
I and a friend once returned a whole laptop with some documents to an address that was on them and the woman who took the laptop turned out to be a wife of an employer who had an employee (ye, I know) that was taken to a hospital after he collapsed on a sidewalk and the paramedics left the laptop there.  She wanted to give us something like $10 (I'm not from USA) but since she wasn't the "real" owner we didn't take it since the address was on our way either way. Shoulda taken the 10
And he’s fine asl
I love how this is apparently news. Good guy, great deed, but if we reach the point where the media feels like covering a returned purse is important, things aren't going so hot.
this proves there’s still good people in the world :) i wanna be someone like this
You know, sometimes we can't judge people by looks. Good for him for doing the right thing.
Good job, dude. If only there were more people like you, this f.....g world would be less desperate ;)
We don't need more people like you  We need to be more like you
Act like Gangsta,helps like hero'... Big props to you ...
just happy the cops didn't see him walking around with a woman's purse or he would be shot hahahahahhaha
"I was just on my way to the next burglary, so I thought to myself, why not return the purse?"  - Good Samaritan
It's sad that we have reached a point in time when this is considered a woah, instead of normal. Good job young man, but we desperately need more people like you, and like your parents.
He’s fine 😭
IRS be like 🤑
Jesus loves you.
👍🇬🇧. Well done that lad!  And a big shout out to his mum for raising him with decency and morality as you clearly have done.
Hi
hes so fine
Thank you, young man for reinstating some hope for us.
show me a race help another race and ill believe it
im going to go out on a limb and say he ONLY returned it because he saw an attractive female fellow mexican on the ID and that he thought maybe he could form a relationship or get some reward gawk out of it. ZERO % chance hed return it if he saw some white guy on the ID or some black guy
Other people be videotaping themselves giving 100 bucks to homeless while earning thousands from ad revenues. Or posting their "generous contributions" for few praises and false admirations. This dude didn't even show himself being bothered with not getting rewarded for his effort the first time round.
I SALUTE YOU KID!!!
Bro everyone be losing stuff all the time
Your a hero mate.
Well done to the lad , younger people get so much bad press. They should be more of him about
whys he dressed like a fuccboi tho
Definitely used it for studio time right after
We need more people like this in this world.
“We need more homies like this” -👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻
He was trying to smash ol girl on the right 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
This is a key example of “Don’t Judge A Book By It’s Cover” type situation. You can see he is dressed in streetwear, which I guess at first glance you’d think he’d steal that wallet, but he returns the cash back to the owner. Kind heart.
We need more news like this👏🏼
Every action have a reaction. Good deeds gets rewarded. Bad deeds gets punished
Nice kid..  Ms piggy will be happy having her bag back 😬
I highly appreciate what he has done, although i find it quite overrated that he gets so much attention (+ so much money wtf?). Since when is such behavior special?
Awesome dude!
As a Japanese, it's a sad world I live in that something like this would be big news.
This dude just inspired ppl a lot more ppl to do the right thing and well that’s good enough 💯
Wow my new scooter was stolen a week after I got it. I taught myself to ride it.I'm 63. my new phone and wallet as well were in the scooter this gives me hope .
Woah He Is So Nice
The world we live in today...if cops woulda saw him walking down the street with that purse he would have been locked up. And no matter what he says they woulda made it look like he was stealing...think about it
She didn't know not to give him anything  my ass. I bet she knows to tip when she's out to eat. But a kid returns her purse with nothing missing and "she doesn't know" to do the right thing. She's saying it like she didn't know not to give someone money returning her bag. It isn't a thing anyone knows, you just do the right thing and hand him money.
“ a California teen” hahah say San Diego. This wouldn’t happen in San Francisco or Los Angeles.
San Diego baby 🙏
Atta boy!
Fake...they raised and shared the money...
Bro so smart he stole the purse heard about the reward then took it back to her as if he found it💀
Bruh lol
LiAurora dimes
my boy just wanted to hit
I love this. Hoping that I’m raising my sons to always do the right thing…”even when no one is watching” ❤️
Great parenting!
Good kid. Great to see hope isn't lost with kids these days being so narcisistic. Hope he has a great life.
I returned my bosses lost wallet last month. Where's my 3k? Lmao.
Great kid GOD BLESS HIM ..
Nah my guy saw how fine she was and tried too seek an opportunity
💖💖
Bless
When my son was 17 he found a very fat wallet with over $15,000 cash in it in a grocery store parking lot where he worked.  He took it in to management and they were able to get it back to the owner who said he had stopped at the store on his way to buy a car with cash.  The guy was shocked that my son returned it and tried to give him a cash reward but my son refused to accept it. He couldn't understand why he should be rewarded for doing what "anyone" would do. Very proud day for us as parents.  To be clear, I would have been just as proud even if he did accept the cash reward. I am certain that Adrian didn't do the good deed expecting a reward but I am happy for him that the people were able to raise one for him.
Nice one kid
Awesome job young man. You’ll go far in life.
The fact that this is normal in Japan W
why does she look like that
Man got famous for doing what everyone should have done lol
Why is this a big thing? It's normal human decency. I guess in a country where the crime rate is so high this is really a miracle.
Wow, what an amazing story.  It gives me hope for humanity.  But my hope is running dangerously low, unfortunately.
Something tells me the lady’s ID was very flattering and he was hoping to end up living out a movie scene.
Wow, I love this.  Thank you for sharing.
He doesn’t look like someone who would return a purse tbh
I like this dude. Wish him the best
hes so fine
he drove there? i would have just posted it in a shoe box.
His mom did a good job, kids going to go places in life.
It's like Evan Holyfield, "My Mama always said."
I did the same in gta
This man is very well raised
Do always the sidemissions lads,   He done it  Mission Passed!  Reward: $3K + Respect!
DANG. i teared up. there's still hope for humanity.
i want to find a lost purse so bad right now
he fine
Mama raised him right
Nice my little g! Paid off!
pray to got hes a millionaire he didnt even take anything from her its like losing something you wanted but you still gave it
Lil Faze Rug saves the day
Karma is real 👏🏻 👏🏻
i did that and the women didnt even came down to her building door to take it herself let alone having a reward ........ few weeks later i got a job
god bless this young man this is personification of Christian principles when properly utilized
Funny what's considered a heroic act in America
If I wasn't homeless I would have turned it in
makes sense, should cover his gas for the drive home. LMao in all seriousness shout out to them both, two great people helping each other out cant get nay better than this.
Now ya’ll expecting money from doing good deeds
It’s me 💀
MMMMMMMILF
Yeah right
A young alpha king
Search the purse, nothing good, return purse, profit, win.
Buddy was tryn hit
hear me out.. hes so cute
Look at the drip, he didn’t need that pocket change.
I returned a wallet with the lady’s important cards and everything. I went directly to the the address that was in the driver’s license inside.The daughter opened the door I told her I found it in the cemetery. While visiting my dad. The lady said thank you I will make sure my mom change’s her cards because we don’t now if u got her information. I told her no problem I only opened it to look for her address to return it. I turned around and left. I did not expect her to give me money or anything. Don’t regret it because god payed me back when my mom forgot her purse in a cart too and we went back to find it and thankfully someone returned it and left it in the store. I will continue to do the right thing all the time no matter what.
Still good 👍 people God blessed always
This guy is more of a hero than the guy that shot the mall shooter
The woman’s only fans rewarded this young man.
So sad how the right thing to do has become the exception.
I found two iPhone outside my house yesterday morning and spent the day working out how to get them back their rightful owners. Where's my 4k?
That fk lies... The mad up the video just to show off and make money on youtube...layers hypocrite
Goes to show that even if you look a certain way doesn’t mean you’re a bad person
w mans
“Fine” young man…bit harsh haha
wat a gud person
that was sweet
If he wasn't rich we'd never heard of him or that purse :D
gj bro
Trump would be like  "Fakeeeeee newssss 🤓
he’s cute
Not only he's good-looking (for me🙄) but he also has the ideal attitude any girl is looking for in a man🥰🥲
Come on, he saw her photo id and was hoping to get some of that juicy Latino taco, 3k will do though 🤷🏻🤣✌️
What a sweet boy! 😭
These two milfs could've given him an experience like no other..
In this world where immorality is praised as social justice this is a heart warming story that makes me feel there is hope
Nah buddy saw the ID and saw a baddie
A true good Samaritan humanity isn't lost yet people we just tend to see more of the bad.
They reward him alright 🌋 🤤
Seeeeeeeee This is why parents do have significant role in a child's upbringing. Teach them good.
Wait so the purse owner didn’t pay him herself ?
That's really sweet
This young fella is 1 in a million. Says a lot we need to praise him in a 2 minute news coverage.  Yesterday is have seen a clip of a similair aged, similair named, similair dressed boi who magdumped an officer out of nowhere in the middle of the mall.
Thanks now I can steal someone's purse and then return it and get 3k dollars
Sadly, in the US this isn't a normal thing.
The fact that everybody is surprised says how bad the situation in the US is
Impossible to see that from a BLM teen thug. Good lad my man
i did this same thing for some lady and she didn't even say thank you.
Why he kinda....🤭
This used to be normal :/
They planned this out together and split the profits. Another group of gofundme scam artists that pray on sympathetic people that believe their made up stories and empty their wallets for them.
Sneakiest thieve in the world.
Plot twist : It was his nephew and stagged
Like in a rockstar game... you never know what your actions will cause in mid or late game... 🤣🤣🤣
👏🏽 🙌🏾 well done .
hes so fine too zamnnnn!!!
God Job , Son ❤️
He saw those lips 💋 on the I.D. and thought 👀 💭💦
I wish everyone would be like this
Integrity
Well done, son.
bitchmade
imagine if he stole like most of the money from the purse then returned it xDD
you set up a go fund me because someone did the right thing?? use the money to do something good omg smh
Dude brought that back because he thoughts he was getting laid
Most kids his age would steal it. He is a good guy
Ja übertreibt doch komplett 😂
I would’ve thrown the purse away
What
🥰
Fine young man. Big respect 👏  I'm glad the police didn't see you with the purse and kill you before you kindly returned it. Stay safe
what kinda world do we live in where, being nice and a good human being is breaking news
Bless him!!! He taught us ALL a lesson.
Integrity
Lol so they raised the money from Go fund me 🤦🏽‍♂️
why dont they give the reward from their pocket instead of funding from strangers?
Wow! I'm in shock, there is hope yet for our world!
DAMN HE A REAL ONE HE ONE YOU COULD ( REEEEEAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLY ) CONSIDER A FREIND
i guess he might be trying to see if it is a nice place to rob next week.
Plot twist. It was all made up to raise money. Acutally a super easy scam which you can never reveal.
Imagine it being Set Up and people donating Money
He fine asl wdf
Good job young man.
scs
He fine
I mean it's great that he did it .. but it's sad we make a big deal out of it because it's not the norm'. That should be what anyone would do.
bueno hombre
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
The woman didnt even give him some bucks for driving all the way to her wow only the other woman
He’s good looking and a huge beautiful soul. He’s gonna have an awesome life! 🤍
He fine as hell too 😭😂
So nice to hear about good people just doing what's right. We need so much more of this nowadays.  Love is the answer...let it shine.
W
Plot twist bro found few bucks and just ate dinner
bruh he saw the photo of the chick on the driving license and went for the honey, don't try and tell me otherwise :D
He saw her ID and said damn she fine 😂
Speaks volumes of the young man.
He's amazing.
parenting done right ...nice
It’s great that this young man did the right thing but sad that in modern society it is such a surprise when someone does
I remember one day I found a woman purse.... with 1000 dollars so many credit cards ... and id's..she had and I'd from a police station... is like she was working there or something i went there and ask for the lady. . And nobody knew her....i show her id.. and they say its here the address but we dont have any information of her....... Like she never existed...i look the address of her house and went there... and they said to me nobody lives here ... I was like what??? That was 5 years ago .. so I left the purse there on the police station...I told them call me if you found her... and to this day nobody knows who is or was she... I was more scared .. than anything..lol
I remind you that he is Latin
Botox makes woman ugly af..
He stole it and sold it back to her for 3k 🤣👌
He was hoping for other kind of Reward
Mom did a good job raising this young man.
Congratulations! Great example for our new generation.
Lmao sounds sketch ✍️
Oh I want to search for him too. I want to marry him.
Allah is always watching you.
1 in a million.
Or he saw her photo and thought hmm? 😛
Awesome
omggg he returned a lost purpose is this guy jesus this guy needs an award, a whole statue of himself, this is UN BE LIEVABLE
Is sad how a act that should be normal to expect from a human being, is appreciated like is a miracle.
It’s beautiful to see something like this in such a disastrous world
Fake
respect
Ima start looking and return purses 😂
W guy
I had a guy return my wallet a few months ago!! Unfortunately the $20 was gone but he said he saw it in a snow bank! Got a hold of me on FB & dropped it in my mailbox!!
What a nice young man - his mother must be very proud of him .
an angel in disguise
Outside view of Home look like aunt Denis in gta 5
thats a BOSS MAN!
Karma Baby, sweet Karma.
*Good Karma*
I would not wonder if they made this all up just to get attention.
This looks fake...🤔
good man
One in a trillion
Dang, where do I donate?
It's nice to hear stories like this every now and then as opposed to the usual "Mass shooting, 10 dead" or "break in results in death" stories. Even though the world can be a brutal place, it goes to show that not everyone is out to get you.
That man is good he is like so cool
These girls asked to keep half of the donated money. That’s so trashy
Goes and puts it down on a SRT, but nah good looks bro! We need more of this in ALL community
Ok? I would’ve gotten a pat on the back
anyone notice the Audi in 2 different spots
Man returns pencil and receives 100 million dollars I wonder what would people think if that happened instead
🙌
its always good to do the right thing
Voilà il existe encore des jeunes honnêtes et bien éduqués
I can think of a million ways to thank the guy.
This restored my faith in humanity
Respect
Yes absolutely. His Parents raised him right.
That's a good person
That’s his mom
I can't even get that much on my go fund me and I have brain cancer
This actually restores some of my faith in the younger generation.
he def saw how fine that lady was from her drivers license 😂😂
This is awesome !!!
Bro He definitely did it for the girl Eliana
Good parents make all the difference in the world.
Dude knew the game probably only saw $100 in the purse and knew he could finesse his way to a couple thousand $$$
bless u mate.
Its good to see young people have morals. May God keep him and bless him.
🫡
he saw the ID photo and knew exactly what to do.
Shame the police have probably already murdered him :(
Returned so many things and never got something back, just a “thank you, bye”. People have to learn also to be grateful a lil bit, even a coffee is enough!
Feel good news
Kid saw the photo on the license and though..."I wanna meet this woman!"
hes cute
Wonder if they let him hit
Why is this a news? He just did normal thing and got reward.
So sweet.
I can think of another good reason that he decided to return the bag (.)(.) haha jokes aside good for him. If you find purse or wallet, always try to return, someone's actual life can depend on that money in there.
damn , he's cute
finally, some warm and hopeful light sheds on the darkness these days in humanity. Good stuff.
central cee?
Jesus loves you guys
my husband dropped his wallet on a bus while travelling to work in Mississauga, Ontario Canada and we were so stressed out as he had his SIN card (Social security), health card, all his credit cards etc, and we were so concerned of identity theft and having to cancel all his cards. Then about 1 week later, we got a knock on the door around 10pm on a Sunday evening with a policeman asking  for his name and confirming his personal info and then handed over his wallet. Someone had found it on the bus and dropped if off at a nearby police station. We were both shocked and truly grateful that a good Samaritan had done this great deed, and so grateful for the policeman going out of his way to personally drop off my husband's wallet.
Good job
I picked up Gucci woman’s purse which had 3credit cards, license, ID cards. reported it to police station in Sydney. Lady there said “would you claim for it if owner doesn’t want?” I said “make sure that it returns to her”
Sort out those lips lmao
Pretty sure he just committed a hood crime.  But props to him.
GOD bless
“There is hope for the younger generation”😂😂 I remember all the wars ever started were by old people👀👀👀👀
He was tryna get her number😂😂😂
Bless him he is a  honest person
Shidd he seen she was a milf and wanted to see where it went. I would’ve too
Must be a Mexican populated area
The worth of healthy parenting is truly immeasurable, well done mum, dad and son!
Adios...
Good Soul! Respect
👏👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️ fantastic! Good lad , his mom be proud ❤️
Good English. Did she gave Ielts to get into USA. Or she just got their because she looks like European
Let’s be honest he came to return the bag because the women looked attractive on the ID and had a chance to pick her up lololololol but then someone else opened the door
Cool💪🏼👍🏽
wtf
I wonder if he had some sort of brazzers plot in his mind when pulling up
In Germany wee say Manuel Neuer verlor his Pocket to , and the finder got a New Shirt 😂
This young man was raised by good parents. We need more people like the parents and son. God Bless them 🙏🏻❤️
"treat others they way that you yourself, want to be treated" -jesus
Nice boy, His parents raised him right :).
W man
He saw the picture on the drivers license ;)
His momma raised him right 😌
Good men finish last but I hope they last too
I remember I returned a purse to some old white lady who dropped it in a mall parking lot . When I returned her purse she took, it never said thanks, and closed the door I was 16 to this day if I see things people forget in the store I leave it and keep on pushing.
hes so fine😭
🙏🏽🥰👏🏽👏🏽
I returned a phone and didn't get anything lol not even thanks. Wish people would have started a petition for me
Beautiful
If I found a purse, and I don't know who is the owner and there is no home address or anything that can help me to return it to the real owner, I will just take it as a sustenance for me and my family.
Jesus loves you still
@1:18, soooo.... surprise han...mmmmmm.
My gosh, I know I have seen a porn video with the exact same story before.
Mama rise him right
Tht purse wasn’t lost just wasn’t useful 🙄
Omg, pornhub is totally gonna make a video out of this. Great deed though.
Could not be me after watching Greta
that's sweet! :)
ሃልሃ
Plot twist he saw the ID of the girl and pulled up to her her number
I’m 15 and for some reason the news and videos like these I like watching but for reels I hope this man never gets into any bad things
Solid young homie 💯
God bless him for his honesty..! Wish we have more people like him...!.100%👍👍👍💕
loving this from Kenya
It’s sad that American in culture you assume that somebody will steal it automatically. Returning someone’s purse should be normal. Props to that kid tho
Says too much about em💯💯
He is sooooo fine
Their good people out their
3 bands?!!!!!!
THIS IS GODS BLESSING🙏🏽💙💙👏🏽
He’s cute
If this was in the hood you’d be lucky if they give u 20$
That was so nice of him.. I wish him nothing but the best ❤️
I love this kind of stuff
Melina.. remember our good times back in our younger days? 😆 thats Great what you did for the youngster! You changed that young man's life.
Nejene
He prolly saw the pic on the license and hoped to get some sexy time.
😊🙏🏽 great job young man!
AND HE WAS FINE🤭
What a legend ❤❤❤
"...when no one is watching"! Very true.
this is the type of news i like to watch
i wonder how set up this was
while he’s at it buy a damn belt
He's a champ. Hat off to his mother for raising such a good young man. Wish you all the best in life young blood because the kindness, and the honesty you put out in this world will always find a way back to you
W teenager :D
He knew the assignment
That's one of the nicest things I've seen in a long time
I ❤ stories like this
If he had done the wrong thing, he would be called a boy. Since he did the right thing, that’s what makes him a man. I’m also 17, and sometimes I get seen as disrespectful and all that, just because I’m a teen. It’s nice to see some of my gen prove those kind of people wrong. <3
The good samaritan foo 😂
He’s ssexyyy
Don’t judge a book by its cover unless he saw the driving license and was trying to pipe
Wat a fool shoulda kept it
That’s beautiful
inshallah my son will be like this
your weird
Just goes to show how screwed up the world is when somebody doing the right thing is something special and deserves a $3K reward for doing it.
Hes fine ash
bad
I did something similar when I found someone ID card between a staircase. I searched them up in Facebook and contacted them there, we agreed to meet in a public place and I returned the card to them.  Too bad the world has only few of us who want to do the right thing.
Honest man, respect
this cuddie returned it so he could pipe 😂😂 he knew his reward
Nice
Nice ppl still exists!
So “Eliana”, lived in her friends house, didn’t update her information afterwards, left her valuable purse in a grocery cart, then doesn’t bat an eye when the kid brings it back? Ok
Excellent story
This is the type of stuff I like seeing on the news
I forgot my wallet on the city bus once it had cash for a Disney trip I was going to the following week, I was in high school so I wasn’t making too much money so the money was from my mom. I panicked but a day later I got a call from the college I was going to on the weekends and said someone had returned my wallet after finding my college ID. It had all my cash in it and I was super grateful. Wish I could thank the person who returned it. After that I’ve always tried doing the right thing even if it means going out of my way because I could really be saving someone.
Some old men weren't raised right then.....
Aw :) that's so sweet
Glory to God 👏
GOD bless this young man and his mom!  Bless this family that raised over $3k to bless this honorable young man!
Ladies  introduce your daughters to him, he would make a fine son inlaw.
Cap
We don’t need more people like him we need to be like him
Well done young man
The world is changing people ❤️❤️❤️
Ps5 and tuition
That’s a good up bring from his parents 👍💪🏻
It brings me joy to see good people in this world He did the right thing his parents should be proud of themselves for raising a good man
The bible NEVER says “good” Samaritan
Nice
Jesus loves you
❤️‍🔥
He went there to tap that
What an incredible mom and an awesome kid.  Yes, there is hope for this world yet.  Thank you young man.
This Young Man had a awesome parent that taught him well. God bless him
She let him hit from the back
What if he returned it because he thought she was cute
Omg that was so sweet
He was hoping for some curry
“fine young man”💀💀
San Diego ❤️
Great advertisement for a device that extremely invades not only thier clients privacy but each and every home, car and person who visits that space. I'm sure that the software connects all the cameras. Great story, horrible company.
That’s a great young man with a ton of courage and a great mindset!
He was smart cuz like he was wearing though clothes like they gotta get a reward fr
and he’s fine 😫
Or he could just take it in the store and not go through it
I'm actually the one who found the purse.  That millennial druggie knocked me down and ran off with it.
Smart guy. Of course you return a purse anyways, you get a chance to be rewarded in a totally different way.
This is literally what your suppose to do people, but it’s really cool they gave him a reward in return though
sigma
Bro did a side quest
Eliana is beautiful
do good and good will come to you
He probably stole it 👴🏻
Wholesome
Bravo Dude! Live long and prosper!
Good man.
The fact that this had to go on the news says a lot about people.
👍🏼🤠❤️
hes fine
“Fine young man”
Handsome and nice, what more can you ask for 😭
If it was Hispanic or black guy ringing my door bell, I would be scared to open the door....LOL. Hats off to this young man, keep it up. You done yourself and family proud!
dude thought "ooooh this the easiest pussy im gunna get in my whole damn life!" and he ends up getting 3000 and becoming famous.
I love people like this not everyone do this in the world it’s very often that they do something like this like l said this warms my heart so much and  I love him so much and this is how you know that he was raised right  sending much love big bro ❤️ .
He fine
Imma start finding purses for a living
Prolly didn’t have cash
He probably the one who set up the go fund me lol
Never judge the book by it's cover... He happens to be one of those young men that chose to go against the bad and does have a lot to to with him as a person his personality and the way he was raised... So happy for the family and this young gentleman...❤👍
What was it n the purse
wonderful god bless that young man.
That's great that he did the right thing and it's great that he is getting hooked up with such a big reward. But wouldn't it be nice if everyone just did the right thing, and it wasn't such a shocking thing that someone would go out of their way to do anything for anyone they didn't know?
Idk why this made me cry, Jesus bless this young man.
first time i see a foo lol
I love him already
Wonder where he found it 🤭😉
Exactly Allah is always watching.Good upbringing by the parents.When you do a good deed you will be rewarded in this world you will never be poor,you will attain peace, satisfaction and rewarded with paradise including your parents because you made them proud.Ameen!
His mom did a great job with him!!!👏🏽
He was trying to get in the guts
🤗🤗
What a great young man. Best wishes for the future!
he did it cause she bad ahaha
Proud of you brother ✊🏼 let’s make USA great again!
Yup I am the boy 😅
That's right! That's a good young man who was raised right! He deserves everything he gots coming! God Bless!
W teen/adult
That’s such a an amazing 🤩 gentleman to take the time out to carry the purse 👜 back to the rightful owner. This young man out here in these street who got their pants 👖 off there butts do have a good 😊 heart do don’t ever judge a book 📖 before u read what’s inside. God will surely blessed 😇 him in the up coming future and I know his mom is so proud of him for what he had done.
I’m
Awesome, man!
he was trying to get some
My husband found a wallet in a parking lot his work was redoing the asphalt. The address on his license was pretty far from us and there were a lot of cheesier cards and work I’d cards he worked for light rail. I contacted the light rail to let them know we had his wallet an would like t get it back to him. They found him. He called us and came got wallet. Thanked us said he would had to get new cards and license plus be in trouble for the work ids.  His wife gave him $20. For returning the wallet do they didn’t have to go threw all the trouble and put out all the money for lost ids. Real nice of her. Ad they drove off in a 2022 new jeep. We did it to help the person so he didn’t have to put out all that money to get new ids etc. but u think they’d been a little more appreciative after all the reseating did to locate him.
What a great young man!
test
Reminds me of a quote, "The true test of a man's character is what he does when no one is watching." - John Wooden
When I was in college I was pulling away from a convenience store on my motorcycle when I noticed a leather wallet on the ground. Opening it up I found a little over $50 and a food stamp book. The ID was of an older black man. There was no phone number but there was an address. This was obviously a person who couldn't afford to lose the 50. let alone the various ID cards. I was hurting for money at the time but it never occurred to me to do anything other than return it to its owner. The neighborhood was rundown and sketchy. I rang the doorbell and explained about the wallet. The man, his children, and grandchildren were there.   They were so kind and grateful. I was rewarded with a wash of neurochemicals that made me feel as good as a drug rush. Doing the right thing, helping people, FEELS good. They told me I must be a Christian to have done such a nice thing. I felt even better when I told them I was an atheist and this shows how one needn't be motivated by religion to want to do the right thing. After a group hug I left, feeling really good. I don't believe in Karma but not long after I left my wallet with a similar amount of money in a phone booth. I  returned the next day to a nearby convenience store. Sure enough, an antonymous person had turned in the wallet.
and he fine
He saw a pretty lady on that ID card and hoped for a.... reward 😅
Idk about y’all but that’s the type of man I wanna marry
He really doesn’t look like the type of guy to do this
Hes smart, he saw how healthy her wallet was and then decided to risk it for a bigger reward
Don’t worry about the money Id rather hit it from behind 💦
It’s not a good deed reallly, he’s the one that stole it and the only tease he’s returning is is because 3k is more money that the purse he suched
I've done nice things a few times and got accused of stealing it. Nothing is lost but they would say something is missing. I learned to throw it in the garbage so no one else losses it
Bless his ❤️
he’s fine too
He’s a cutie and a nice person!!!
whaaat.
The funny thing is that the honest young man returned the purse to what appears to be a  dishonest eliana martin. She used to live at that house, but failed to update her change of address as required by cali law.
🫶🏻🫶🏻
What a wonderful young man and what a wise woman he has as a mom ❤️
God bless you son
HES SO FINE BRUH.
He was doing the recon for a future burglary 😄
Fdsdf
okay but he fine 😭😭🤭
gg
So not all our parents told us this?
What a great example of honesty. This world needs so many more like him. 👍🏻
It wasn’t lost, he stole it
Attaboi Adrian, keep it up my man.
Bro I seen a snake lol
God bless him 🙏🏾🙏🏾
YUPSSSS THAT RIGHT WE UOUNG BUT STILL COO
You know damn well he went through the purse saw that fine ass milf and was like "You know what I think ill return this" with a smirk on his face lol
Good job young man
wow . 🦩☯️
Imagine if they were related and planned that so they could get 3k lol
It is a sad commentary on our society that this qualifies as a news story.
I think one thing some people fail to realize is that doing good deeds is just as much for you, as it is for the other person. When you do good deeds, especially going out of your way like he did, it does something for your spirit. I love doing for others. makes me feel useful and like i'm contributing to something good in the world. The only thing better than that feeling is doing good deeds without broadcasting them! He did not expect anything. He just wanted to do good. 👏👏👏
Good guy
17 yr old did a good deed. Good deeds go a long way.
Maybe I should be a good guy
naah if i do a good deed there is no money reward at all. i would just walk away
why he look like a 90s new york thug
I forgot my bag in a shop cart like this in Walmart's parking and somebody left in a costume center. Incredible I got my bag back! Congratulations to the boy!!!
What a scam...
He probably returned it so you may reward him
I’ve returned so many wallets! I feel like their put in front of me to find bc I always return what I find ❤️
No plot twist jokes?
odds he stole it found nothing and gave it back
You know what has no hope?
Piano that has God almighty no other just get down on your knees and pray cuz now that you talking about somebody give you three came back a lost purse that someone would give you 3K for bringing back their purse brother it has something in it or not that's no one but the grace of God always remember that you look down on you and that's a miracle both ways both ways and bringing you the purse back you giving him money for that week and you didn't have to do so just always remember that both of y'all
Sick
Nice
That was awesome!! Good work Adrian!!!
If this was my Son I cannot begin to tell you how proud I would off him. We need more of this. God bless this boy, so proud..........
Imagine they planned that whole thing out
Cool
good man
God Bless Him 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

Good kid
Dude's a legend
Lucky bastard. 3 grand for returning a woman's purse
W
I think we all know he saw the if picture and instantly knew he was gonna return it 🤣
This kid has integrity! Good job MOM for raising a  great kid.
he was just trynna make a play
Wtf haha that's my name 2 Adrian Rodriguez
Did he get the cash?
I'm sure that ID photo, had something to do with it too - lol
prolly sent it back cuz he thought she was fine😂
Now that's a true homie
I’m confused tho why a go fund me for just doing the right thing?
great))
he fine too😍
Sweetness!
Should’ve told them your into MILFs
I literally did something like this before. Someones ID was left at a park and the address was to someone around the corner. so i went to their house and i asked if they knew the name of the ID. So they confusingly said yes and i told them i found this ID. Turns out it was his parents and they said they gonna hide it from him as punishment 😂
👍
Cool
Integrity
he only returned it cause he prolly saw her id in the purse and she was bomb
Now there's a real human being
See there really is good people left in this crazy world. Good guy!!!
Какого хре на это у меня в рекомендах
I found a wallet and returned it
in my opinion i couldve kept the purse alll to myself. if i was him.
Nmao hobfs
Bro missed a blessing what a goof
He started up a drug ring with the money raised and is now serving time behind bars
Had he been black they would have called the police and taken him to jail
If only 10% of teens were even half like this kid, there'd be hope for this country
From the way he look, he'd lucky to not run to an off-duty white cop,. Otherwise, he'd be tackled down with a knee for 6min on his neck and frame him as perpetrator.
shared
💕
There's hope
Wow
This is a whole news story lmao
and he fine asl🤨
Adrian the 🐐
GTA IRL but in all seriousness W Man we need people like him. That’s how my parents raised me. Glad people show kindness and prove they care
The news is just so depressing these days, nice to see they show something like this.
that looks more like 4k
Plot twist: he jacked it and realised there was only cards in there. Can't get away with fraud easily now days so he took the gamble of returning it with the potential for a reward and gratification. Lol.
I just checked. He’s way above 17k now.
Great kid that has had great parenting. Keep it up man 🙏
Real G
Set up smh tho
Very wholesom
i probably wont ever be like this guy, no joke  i would either ignore the purse or get too lazy to find the owner and turn it in to a lost and found or smth ..yeah im not a very good person
Woah!
It’s a good deed if you refuse the reward. Now it’s just being paid for a job well done
This man knows how to carry a purse! Thumbs up if you agree 👍
Imagine he just snagged like 100$ outta the purse before he returned it😭😭😭
🥶🥶🥵💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Jesus is king y’all please stay safe out here guys🤎!!!
That is why in Islam the whole belief is based on Allah is watching you in all your actions. So it won't matter if no one is watching since Allah is always is.  You don't touch even one penny if it is not yours.  Also in Ramadan you can't even get a small sip of water for 15 hours even if your desk by yourself and that water bottle is sitting right there.  Why?  Because Allah is watching you.
I've been doing the right thing my whole life and a reward was never expected. Since when did doing the right become an anomaly in our society? But kudos to this young man. 👏
What a honest and fine young man
Lol it looks like he would be one to steal it
Ya know. I’m so proud of this kid. I am unforgivingly critical of humanity but he helps restore my faith in random and devoted goodness.
Very nice video!
Where’s the link to this GoFundMe? I want to see if I can add to it too. Sets an awesome precedent for other young men.
Could’ve easily taken what was in the purse, did God’s will and got that and plus some while also earning respect🤍 Videos like this is what raises the vibration of the collective, good ish, good ish🤍🤍🤍🙏🏽
bruh whyd they do him like that.. the opps know how he rockin now 😭
It’s both good and bad that this has gotten media attention because the realty is… This doesn’t normally happen. For it to be reported on the news, shows how much more so of a big deal it is. Let’s normalize doing things like this for future generations.
Dios te bendinga muchacho..tienes angel protector!un gran Corazon ♥
A credit to his parents 🙏🏼🫶🏼🤍
Good job young man!
Awe
Another comment section more interesting than the video content. Since we all got an opinion I think he was tryn to hit that. Since he prob got shot down and it’s only been 2 weeks since videos up. Hell be back with 3 of his friends to rob the place once the story die down.
I found a woman's purse once.... No extra rewards though
Heaven’s waiting for him
What a great guy he is
he’s smashing that in
His mom raise him right! He will go far in lifeGod Bless❤️
good luck man good luck.
COOL GOD BLESS HIM
I would want 1 of them frl
This should be shown a lot more!
Orale! Way to go carnal!
He damn near took the purse...they told em it was a reward so he brought that hoe back...nah I'm just playin😆
i would of got him 3000$ cash and some nnice flowers lol hats off this young buck..sad to say i jus had my phone stolen the past weekend..nothing but bad luck for me past few months hoping that will be changing very soon
Bravo to this kind kid. Allah gives him nice life with nice job reward.
This is straight out of a side event from GTA 5
Respect !
I don't return things anymore!. I found 4 phones and they didn't offer me a dime!. I found a iPhone 13 about 5 month's ago and I'm selling it on eBay!. I'm sorry! but its not that much kindness on earth!.
Awesome kid
yall trippin he seen the picture of the mamacita on the license hes 17 people have done way more to get a hug
he fine
the botox make her look like the doll from goosebumps
You know he saw the I.d and said damn she fine my dream of having a cougar is coming true,it's even got the address😂😂😂
Doing tha right thing is always good…but my boy knew he had to return it once he saw tha I.d of an attractive Latina 😂
It's wonderful to heard of good deeds in these trying times.  Best wishes to all of you!
It’s rare these days for young people to do good things like this, sadly. God bless him. I hope lots of good things happen for him
give without expecting anything in return. Huge lesson
He did a hidden side quest
One good deed deserves another.
Very cool. A sign of societal health. A rare find, and hopefully a harbinger of more to come!
Amazing Teenger
That was cool
Should’ve gave him those digits
cant lie the purse owner was whack her friend cared more about it then her lol! im glad the family wanted to step in. prayers to them all! And yes always do the right thing even when nobody is looking.
I bet if it was a white guy who returned her purse she wouldnt make a big deal about it and she'd just be like "oh right, thanks..." then slam the door on his face
Love this guy
Thats wassup young buck “do the right thing even when no ones is watching” thats a blessing right there bro 💯
As a 33 year old, I say the younger generation likely has more empathy than the older generation, so I cringe a bit when I hear “there’s hope”. Everybody should look in the mirror. That said, good on this young man!
Fine young man 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
my mom told me to always do the right thing
Hi
His parents raised him right... great job... can't judge people just by the way they dress or look... look at this man here he returned the purse nd did the right thing
Such a good person, not many people would have done that ❤️
Eliana needs to stop getting cheek fillers 🤣
The fact that he was kind enough to set the gps- I could never
Also a prime example of “don’t judge a person by their appearance.”
My dad is elderly now, he used to work in the fields in south texas weather(102°f) for over 40 years. Back breaking work and he is a genuine honest man, this one time he went to buy lunch and dropped his wallet but didnt notice until he got home around 7pm. The next day a kind man returned the wallet☺️            Too bad he didnt return it with all of my dads credentials and money that were in it🤣
That is awesome he did the right thing and was rewarded. His was raised right and his mother I'm sure is super proud of him.
It’s sad how “A California teen performing a good deed” is so rare it’s newsworthy
I’m feeling so much better watching this news🙏🏻thank you
Gta
Should should had took money like in gta
Much respect young king 🤴
He probably wanted to h!t🙍
Thumbs down for ads
Life's lessons learned by the best. Mom!! Adrian👍👍!! That 3k is good for college!!
well done homie.. i know returned ut coz she was hot ☺️☺️☺️ ayyyy
My cousin did this once and the guy didn’t even say  thank you. He literally just said “did you take any money?” When my cousin replied no, he then just said ok cool then shut the door right in his face.
No no no he saw that ID and realised she was a 10, would love to see him return that to a fat person 🤣🤣🤣
There is still hope 🙏❤️
😄
Man’s really setting the example do the the right thing that’s all that matters
Nice man that’s the spirit! Everthing that not belongs to you is not yours and you had to give it back 👍🏽👌🏽
Adrian kinda fine y’all
Well done young man.
To many youngsters,watch this & take note of how to be 👍🏾
I would never
W teen
God Bless🥰
That good to see.
That's what you call a very sensible young man and very honest well done to you!!
Beautiful story as my self have been robbed by a guy in LA....
That boy looks like from the show The Dog or Me.
Just imagine a world full of these kind of people.
There is never a time "when no one is watching," because God is always watching. If all people understood this, there would be far fewer crimes and wrongs in this world. Jesus said, "do your alms in secret, and God rewards you openly." This man is a great example.
Inspirational and awesome and heartwarming
Too bad that never happens IRL. Once I've found somebody's phone and when I called one of the numbers from recent calls to return it, I was not only not rewarded, I was accused of stealing that phone.
We must continue to be mindful of the things that we do! Great job young man! Great parenting as well!

Got some head too
Yo yo nice try playa

Awesome news story 👏  great people all around.
Fire job my guy 🔥🔥🔥
Goes to show you shouldn't judge a book by its cover
❤️👍👍
This is the kind of man I want my son to grow up, and be like.
the purse was surely empty already
I remember riding on a light rail in Oregon and I found a wallet so I opened it and looked for anything containing info about the person who owned it I called and said I found your wallet and we met up I declined the offer of money for finding it but he wouldn't take no for a answer so I got $20 but hey this guy finds a purse and returns it and gets a $3k reward for not stealing anything lucky for him. There's some honest people out there and some you don't dare trust and I've got a kind heart but have had many people hurt me over trust so I'm weary.
doing the RIGHT thing ain’t hard ! And it will make your life so much easier later on …. Doing the WRONG thing will make your life so much harder later on cuz karma will come knocking  You can tell this gentleman been thru a lot in life and know how hard it is to lose important personal stuff and how to be a good person 👍
Cardi b white version
good luck convincing the offeminists this can actually happen lolz
there nothing special about that .its normal.
His cute😭
The pinch hold when he has the purse 😌🤣 but love to see all of it
I’m so glad that I’ve done acts like these
Good kid!!great kid!!
Much respect to him! What a good guy! ❤️🙏🏻🤲🏻
❤️
Good guy 😊
Oldest trick in the book steal something and wait till they look for reward money
GTA 5 option to take cash or return to be good citizen.
hes a good person
he fine too
He wants to clap this cheeks
thank you Jesus.
Americans be shocked someone did the right thing. This is wholesome, but it shouldn’t be a privilege.
Is that J.I the prince of NY ?
It was me I would return purse That refuse reward Meaning be glad to purse  Who it belongs to
he is not a good man or either a hero, he is just a person who has common sense
💥 GOOD ON YOU young man !!  Looks like your life is heading for success. I don't know you personally but I can say that I'm proud of you. 💙 I bet your mother is too‼️
My man is simpin. Much respect
What a nice guy
He probably stole it and gave it back to get the reward
Latín respect 🙏🏻
God bless him and be with him he’s so young and so wise a good deed for a good deed
Good kids still do exists but that's like 1 in a billion
Jesus is always watching
M
I'm crying.
Y’all do realize this man stole the purse in the first place😂😂
But did y’all get his number tho… asking for a friend
Want to know a different rude twist? My sister’s friend leaves her purse somewhere at the store for me to grab. Her house has cameras.. I returned her purse (nice guy) and then she goes to set up a gofundme that will soon be close to 20g after new reporters come for my honesty and “faithfulness..” Easy scam eh? 🧏🏼‍♂️💆🏻‍♂️👨🏼‍💼  Like if you like the tactic i just learnt from watch these type of vids!
Here at Greece kid returned a bag with 300k bag and he earned 500 euros
Great kid. Don’t judge a book by its cover
:]
I hope my son would do the same thing- In fact I don’t hope I know he would do it
I wish the everyone was as nice as this lol, no homophobia, no racism, no bullying, and always being honest would make the world so much better
Why American always react so dramatic compare with European citizins
heck yes.
Thank god there is hope for humanity!!
Good for that young man!
Much respect to this teen, he has a good soul. 💕
That happened to me while at work, found a purse in a parking lot. Brought it to the police, I hope they got it back to the lady.
I know those back shots on the girl on the right go crazy
Thats the way, leading by example 😍
Mashallah
THAT'S street cred', no matter which way you look at it. He absolutely did the right thing!
This is a more mature act than I would've done at 17. 28 years ago sadly!!!💯😔😞
based
Aww this was heartwarming
Last time I returned a purse forgotten, I got beaten and had to go to the hospital
He’s mom must be so proud she raised him right 😊
His current gofundme is up to 16.5k, worked out pretty worth it to return the purse haha
Play fortnite
You said that kid is 17 years old and he's acting like a real man already.... he's going to be somebody someday... maybe the mayor of San Diego ~ God bless Him....
The fact that this is "news" is horrifying actually. This should be normal.
Hmmmmm I’m not completely buying this, I could be dead wrong though.
i love that!
We need people like him like Allan peter Cayetano who promise us his 10k
Also he didn’t have an annoying accent, so that helps too
That’s awesome 👏
Fascinating that normal human descency needs to be celebrated that much in the US.
Love it!!!
Very nice video!
Outstanding! This made my day...maybe even my month!! Such a great story. What a good kid, we need a few million more like him.
Finder's keepers...
“Ay i found your purse foo”
What a good egg. We need more of these young men.
i literally did something like this and they lost their purse again like a week later
That's a man 👍👍❤❤ The parents raised him right.
W mans
Way to go kiddo he's going to have a blessed coming to him in soo may way🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
Humanity is tragic because this type of acts should be normal not an heroic act, so if someone get her bag back and rewards someone else of 3K to me is more a tragedy for us than a good thing. Anyway respect the boy which could do anything with the bag and the hole stuff.
Well done to both sides!
He looked like Lil Skies in the thumbnail
Things which the media should promote
Well done this young man 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Or somebody watched the “Coach Carter” at the right tíme 🤣. Ok stop jokking.. It was a really good choice of his..
What a nice thing for this young kid to do , he returned it too it's rightful owner without stealing anything inside , I'm glad they raised all this money for him , may he succede in life !!!  👍😃🙏
Wow! Why? Lol 😂 He should have kept it and ran!
Sounds like it was nothing valuable in the purse…
If all parents taught their children with good values the world would be better and safer to be in...
my boi bought weed with that cash and no one can say that’s wrong 💀
okay but can we talk abt how fine dude is 😩😩😩
[•There will always be a good guy to balance the evil I’ve done•]
I returned someone’s car keys yesterday and I knew were there car was man I did get nothing
Lmaoo his mom probably had him take that back 😭😭
great
Nice
Integrity. kudos.
you mean he stole the purse when you didnt see, saw nothing valuable and then returned it to get fame and a lot of money... well smart man ill say !
Spike Lee Do The Right Thing
he kinda fine
It at just over $16k now. That’s awesome, it has literally paid off.
thats probably his auntie trying to get him a gofundme
Good job Adrian ! God bless you always !
w
I've returned tons of stuff I've found that was lost an nobody ever gave me anything
Good parenting maybe people should focus on that and we would have less mentally ill children running around in america doing crime.
Yes we will fix the turd piles of people who made poor decisions
What was in the purse tho
I usually skip this part
I was in a ride with someone was in my family and we were taking a ride and pick up truck that he wants had and I went for a ride towards to rock creek and I noticed it was a purse for there but I knew somebody either lost it or someone stole it and threw it in the creek or something like that but I don’t think it was stolen I think the person lost the purse and I did with Zack same theme just like this young man dead so I return the purse by giving it to the cops and they had that taken care of after we left and if you days or so we went back to the cops and say did she gets purse back but he didn’t say who it was to us or anything beyond that and he said oh yes but he doesn’t have no name or anything but with this video remind me of it too it’s called doing a good deed for somebody more than a good deed it’s more than like you’re paying it forward for someone for the insider news Chevy people doing a story about not just good deeds but paying it forward that is what I did for her just like that movie with Kevin Spacey Helen Hunt and Haley Osment and they starred in paying it forward that is what I did was the person years later I know how I can have that just says 17 year old boy doesn’t exact same thing that I did but he found it at a store but not on the web Creek like I did but it still the same thing and I praise God for does young man
Wow
EEYYYY!!! I♥️SD BABY!!!! that how we do it down here , 1 big familia
He cute asffff🤪🤪
he returned ur purse and beg to raise money? u shd pay him out of ur pocket . this aint a social cause
Don’t judge a book by its cover !
when i did this the little old lady gave me a big thing of different kinds of teas :)
Keep the reward! Let me see that head game
P
In other words, LOVE is the ONLY answer.
There is great hope for our country,  don't listen too MSM!  our country is full of wonderful people.
Very lucky guy, I once returned a purse I found in an alley and the lady gave me five dollars.
Hes so fineee😭
Good man
What  a wonderful young man His mum must be so proud His future is guaranteed  because he is a young man of excellent  stature.
3,000 dollars for returning a purse is a bit much. I will sayyyy. like. He was being a good person and sometimes beigg my a good person shouldn’t need an award
But how he figure out the address??
💜💜💜💜💜
He’s cutee 😍😍
ya lucky that wasnt me dat stole dat thang
Sure where my reward nal God bless me everyday cuz I do this all the time for people this guy left his whole wallet in the laundry mat and I drove all the way to his mama house and dropped off his wallet she was lskeptical at first because she lives on her own private land. Yes it is hope for the Young generation I'm proud of this young man glad to know I'm not the only one
I found that purse and my homie took it from me to give it back
Santa is ALWAYS watching.
it's kinda sad that this is a "special occasion", people should do this all the time
i love him
That foo just wanted to meet that baddie lmfao
Bless his heart🙌👏👏👏🏆
A flicker of light for the future that one
Hi
Why do people say there’s hop for the nee gen when we the one correcting their mistakes like huhh
Them kids in juvenile should watch this on repeat
The fact he did without expecting money makes it more amazing
A few years ago I found a purse in Amsterdam. It was from a tourist (they were sitting next to me at the fountain in front of the Rijksmuseum and had left a few minutes before I noticed the purse), so I went to the police station to return it. Police was surprised that all the money (a few hundred Euro) was still in there. It never crossed my mind to take the money out and I just wanted them to get their credit cards and ID back, as it can be a huge pain to lose those (especially in a foreign country).  I never heard back from police, so I expect the tourists to have gotten it back.
Omg wow a person doing the bare minimum and returning something that doesn’t belong to them
I hope he buys a belt first :)
Kid wanted a 3some ended up with 3k still a W
With so much wrong in the world this is an uplifting story !
There is definitely no hope for our young generation 😂
This is me when I found my girlfriends bike. I'm 19 and this is kinda reletable
YES!! I love stories like this!
That photo Id must've been bussin when she was younger 😂
Dang bro 3k time to go find purses and get 3k!
Good job. But I think we shouldn’t say “hope for the younger generation”… most of the things can be feared from the older generation
Nice to see there is some good even from the youngers.
Yeah right! He was waiting on that tip money baby!! 😂
If he was a middle aged grown man they would have been calling him a creep or something. The good deed would have gone unnoticed
It was 10/11k
That's typically who'd you expect to come rob you 😂
This is why you should give power and money to nice people. They make sure to give back to the world
I mean every time I find a wallet or purse I just take it to customer service gas is expensive
Kudos to you boy. Honest people still exist
My Sons Dad left my purse in a Target cart years ago with over 8,000 dlls cash. And my wallet with ID & legal documents. Security Gabriel found it after we called the shopping center @BassettPlace he was a blessing, my purse had every single thing in it. They day when you do good deeds it comes back, because years back I returned a wallet with cash and blank money orders that was left outside my back then job on the fuel pumps of a gas station. So when you do a good deed and don't keep what's not yours Blessings come your way. The person got all her stuff and when it happened to me I did aswell. The only difference between the customer at my job and myself is that I did thank the person even tried giving him a reward and he refused it. The lady at my job accused me of keeping her wallet, when I showed her video cam footage of how she takes her wallet from the cashier area she stayed quiet. Not even an I'm sorry I was wrong or even a Thankyou. From her but it's OK. At the end when my purse was lost I recovered all my belongings... I Called that Positive Karma. Blessings to This honest young man.
Amen
10k actually
He saw her photo on her ID and hope for some psychical repayment!
Great Story and what a Great young man he deserves to be acknowledged and rewarded .
They want him
This is normal in Norway lol
They should've tag teamed the young man.
he wants sum else;)
God bless him
faith in humanity +10%
In Germany we call him ''Ehrenmann''    Good Boy
if i was him i would’ve just asked to hit shawty in the back🤣🤤
16k now
I did this but I don’t wanna do it again, some people just don’t know how to say thank you.
I think the universe puts certain people in certain situations.  I have found and returned three wallets with all their contents.  Once the wallets was laying on a ledge by the line for Santa and it was bulging. Clearly, the woman was intending to shop.  As I flagged down security, I saw a woman frantically running to that spot.  I knew it was her.  She must have thanked me a hundred times.  Do onto others as you want others to do onto you.
Good news 👏🏼 always welcomed
do ppl not understand that this is the bare minimum?
Good job, but its rare in America do this, now a days
I love this they need to show more of this on the news 🙌🏾👏🏾
That boy saw her fine ass on her ID and had a plan right away lol I would’ve returned it too and spit some game
Even human kindness has a price tag it seems
Many blessing to that young man what great kid.
i would do the same thing too. and if they offer a blow job and threesome i would take that too.
God Bless him 🙌
This kid has amazing parents.
It is so crazy that people get recognized and put on inside edition for doing the right thing. That’s how messed up this world is.
What an awesome young man!!! If this young man sees this, and needs a career. Come too phoenix, ill get you started as a plumber. Good stuff!
"Theres hope for our younger generation" bro?😭😭
Good stuff
the fundraising…wtf😭 hes lucky
God damn he was raised right god bless him and his momma. not to mention he finee😭😭
It pays to always do the right thing!!!
Literally fake
Alright sorry I'ma break the fairy tale but here is really whats going on in the head of a 17 years old teenager male: He found the purse, saw the picture on that ID, and figured out bringin in the stuff back would lead him to meet that cutie, and eventually smash.  This is not being a good samaritan, this is testosterone for you.  I know what I'm talking about, I've been a teenager boy before myself.
hes fine
The real suprise: A TEEN DID IT!
That is a very nice young man. May God bless him.
No run a blood test
No run a blood test
It's saying that don't judge a person by his appearance, but look at his sincerity, what a sweet young man
Is America this bad?  I’m in Canada and this is just normal, standard behaviour.  I don’t believe that most Americans would take the money not return the purse.  Driving it over is nice, but it can’t be newsworthy(?).
Both of them ladies could get it lol
Well done my guy!
I am confused....its considered some unnatural deed 😶😶...its the norm here 🤦🏽🤦🏽
We Stan a fine young man
✨️👌🙏👜✨️
Always do the right thing that’s so kind
Now watch purses always get returned for big money rewards
This teen should be a model for us to follow behind. We all should be as kind as this boy.
He could’ve stolen whatever was in the purse, but instead he returned it to his rightful owner. What a nice guy.
That was nice of him. ❤️
Interesting
3K AINT EVEN THAT BAD THATS ACTUALLY A GRATEFUL PRICE 💯💯
That’s a bright young man. His mother raised him right. Many should follow that example. Do good deeds and you never know the blessings that may come your way. That’s awesome.
Pay it forward.  Always stay humble and kind.  The world needs more people like this young man.  Bravo!
My cat does bring me dead birds every day. I should start a go fund me for her good deeds.
W guy
I gave a person a lotto scratcher the won on but didn't notice it was a million dollar winner years ago. To get nothing. And I even scratched the prize amount so I knew it was a million before giving it to the owner. He promised close to enough money to buy a new car. He died 2 days after he got paid he was dying of cancer. Of course his family members spent through the money and never gave me a dime
i dont mean to have a lil cynicism but i also hope everything in ha purse was in there and dat he didnt touch any of it cause even if someone returns some to me i still would hope everything is in there that i know was in it
Plot twist he took the bag
I once found a wallet on the street, and I picked it right up. I looked inside it and saw an ID card which belongs to someone living close by. Although I had some errands to run, I first went to his apartment and returned the wallet to him. I think he dropped it when he was returning home from work all tired, I asked him first did he drop anything, he looked inside his bag and said he must have dropped his wallet, I handed it over to him and felt very good… and that person was also so overjoyed, he tried to give me something in return, but I told him it was not necessary, but kindly pass this act in future to someone else…
Mannn! This kid has good things coming to him, this life is definitely going to bless him. A good heart carry’s you a long way.
I'm really glad her friends and family donated money to reward him.....that was kind gesture.💜
Lol that’s nothing but what a good guy
The lady with the dark hair is hot!
Inside edition is all about fake , do some research it's his aunt
This small act of humanity went viral. Not saying it's a bad thing but it kinda shows how society is
Notice the way he was dressed easily could of been profiled as a gangster something but goes too speak never judge a book by its title .  Way too go young man representing the latino community
Wow what a good kid. Gives me hope!
he’s fine
MayGod bless this young man, his mom must be so proud of him
That is such a blessing
Plot twist the girls take the money they raised for him
🙏
Far he so good to do that ❤️❤️
Awe 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
Based and redpilled
Wow what a nice kid
thuggin
Any g would see if there is money in it first tho
Why did you return the purse?  I liked the photo ID.
I god damn with, I can't even afford rent hahah
and that's how I met your mother
I love this story!!❤
🙏👑🙏
Just when im ready to write off mankind some dude wrecks it by displaying morals ethics and values.  Damn back to optimism lol
This happened to me as well a few years ago, I was driving on the road when I noticed a purse.  I stopped and picked it up looking for any ID.  The purse was like a few houses down the road on the same street I was on.  I got to the old ladies' house (this house literally looked like a haunted house) to return the purse only for the old lady to accuse me of taking her pension check or something like that.  I was like ma'am I didn't steal anything from your purse, I think the more you help out sometimes, you could possibly get into trouble.  She was lucky most people run off and never return your stuff.  SMH!
Y’all hear me out.
Raise in a good home ❤️
She bad asfff
Yup don’t judge a book by it’s cover
Plot twist . He stole the purse and felt bad that he did it . So he followed her home and waited a few hours outside her home and approached the door looking like the white 50 cents and respectfully gave her the purse . ♥️
I'm glad he returned it. About 3 months ago my stepdaughter left her purse in a cart at Walmart and before she could get back to Walmart to get it it was gone ! The person that took it got almost the same reward seeing as how she had $2800. In the purse!!
Wallet was probably empty
thats how the world should be
Wish the teen that stole my phone would have returned it.
She shouldn’t have gave him anything. He did what we all should do. Simple as that.
Deep down, I aspire to be like this
We need more people like him
His mother deserves an award for raising such an amazing man  We should all learn a thing or two from this young man. I’m glad I came across this video and actually restored my faith in humanity
Everyone says there should be more people like him but no one wants to be like him..
Someone RAISED him right... NOT EVERYONE IS A LOONEY  LIBERAL!
I once drove 20 miles to return someone's lost wallet.  I eventually found their house and knocked on the door.  Door opened, hand came out, took wallet and the door shut 😄😄  Biggest anti climax to a good deed that I've ever had 😄👍
Wow faith in humanity  He exemplifies what we try to teach our children  Wonder job mom
CHOLOS AINT BAD 👏🏼🙌🏼🙏🏼👍🏼
Excellent young man.
That’s a good kid right there, mama raised her boy to be a man and it shows!
he fine
i'd expect a man like him to keep it
When I was 16 I was riding my bike to the gas station when I found an envelope on the ground. Upon opening it I realized it was a check for $1,600 dollars. I looked around but saw no one, so I examined the paper more closely and identified an address. I then returned the envelope to the address leaving it in there mailbox because they were not home, at that point I continued my way to the gas station. Upon arriving at the gas station I had crossed the cross walk and was waiting for my friend to cross. It was then that I glanced over and found a $5 bill and it made my day cause I knew god was looking out for me and even though $5 ain’t much, it still made my day cause I only had some change to my name for a slurpee
Good kid, great parenting
My Name!!!
I wouldn’t do dat I’m takin da money ofn
I'm glad for him, it's nice to see good deeds being rewarded. Once I saved a 4 year old from drowning and I didn't get a thank you from anyone, not even his mom thanked me.
that boy was raised right
Bless this young king !!!
Good news very good news
😇❤👏👏👏
Adrienne
You guys get rewarded?
And he’s a cutie 🥰
They really hittin us with the kracc bacc doorbell sound
Theres more plastic on her face than in the ocean
🖤🖤🖤
Thats my hometown san Diego
Yet grown MEN wouldn’t even do that, respect for this young king he will definitely go far in life ❤️his parents definitely raised him right
I've returned stuff and wallets, cell phones but got no rewards. U don't always get them
🥲🥲🥲
Sad that this is a news worthy story. Wish the best for this young man
He just wanted to smash once he saw that ID
Left 40 bucks in a self checkout. By the time I walked back into store, Someone had already handed it to the clerk and walked off. Gangster!
🤍🤍🤍
God bless him  😍😍😍😍😍
“Criminals,rapist,drug dealers”
He's so sweet. Handsome young man too!!
May God bless him and his family.
“The kindness that you put out to the world always comes back to you”
Guy has good character he's gonna go far!
We don't need more people like him. We need to be those people like him
Just from the title, THAT'S IS SO GOOD!!! Not only on his part but for her to reward him like he should be (in a money situation). Bless her!!
Says a lot about our society when normal behaviour like this brings out such surprise in a lot of people. He's a normal decent person. There's more out there....somewhere.
Ok now i gotta go find and return a lost purse bc i got rent and bills to pay! Lol
Cool I've found 2 purses, a wallet with over 3 grand in it and 2 debit cards and a cellphone in the past 2 years. I found the owners and returned every single 1 of them and got nothing in return 1 guy didn't even thank me he just smiled and said see ya later. The next 1 I find I'm keeping it. I've always done the right thing and life is hard for me I watch my dad and my brother rip people off all the time and they have plenty of money
I really like this is a good kid he should get a good scholarship
Great to see
Maybe he didn’t take it cuz there was nothing in it 😭😭
What an amazing young man!
using God's name in vein is unHoly
Paid him the amount of the purse 👛😎
what a amazing act
Dude got more than money, he got some Latina booty
.
Good kid, n a lot of people would be nervous walking by him cuz of how he dresses. Don't judge a book!
good for him !   good he got $3k
What amazes me the most is the amount of people in the comments astonished by this kid's action and the "we need more peopke like him" stuff. I mean, you guys wouldn't return the purse? Aren't his actions the normal thing to do?
Remember God loves you♥️😊! John 3:16  For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. Please repent, change your life around and live for Him🙏🙏. He is coming back soon🎊🥳.......
He deserve that reward cause I would've snatched tf out of that purse on god
Hes bangin both those women, same time sometimes too!, I know the dude
taking a moment to say HES SO LENG BRO
I used to work at Pizza Hut and one night I found a wallet in the front carryout area where people place their order. I showed some of my co-workers the wallet and a couple of them wanted to go through it and see if there was any money. I refused to let them go through the wallet, and ended up tracking down the owner of it through social media. He came by the next day and picked it up, thanking me wholeheartedly. He opened up his wallet, took out a hundred dollar bill and handed it to me. I said "No thanks man, don't worry about it." He then said "You're a good dude" and offered me a $5 instead which I accepted.
an angel!👏
Brazilian / Portuguese name.
Mfs will say there’s hope for the new generation. Mfs acting like every kid is a bad kid
Humble, caring & wise. What a heartening young man.
Wow be amazed by Smth normal in japan that's funny
Everyone talking about good faith but if I seen the id and seen who it was I would’ve returned it too😂😂😂😂
Soooooo good of him.  Blessings always to him all the days of his life.  Good teachings ...
About time something positive is reported about our youth.
The aunty is bad tho
This tells a lot of america, everyone is shocked when somebody is not robbing others stuff.
Is this type of thing exceptional in the U.S.A. ?
Foo gone wild
Fun fact: Returning The purse was a Prank    Actually he got caught in CCTV dating those ladies
He’s fine
Love seeing people especially  youth do the right thing
My good be with all of your life, your Mom taught you well!👏🏽👑👏🏽
Don’t judge a book by their cover. I always get the cold shoulder cuz of how I look just look him but we have the same mindset. Most of us who grew up in a Mexican household grew up by that saying
Adrian, your Mother is a smart Woman.
Nice
I mean who wouldn’t like you have to be a sick person just to steal a little purse.
Dang man we need people in this world like this man this is awesome.
He returned the 45 dollars in the purse 👛 in hopes of receiving a large sum of money for being honest . Hey it worked ! What, You people think  if there was 3,000 dollars in it he would have been so honest?? 😂
Do unto others as you would want them to do unto you. 🙏🏽
This dudes grinding the side quests for the cool armor
thought that was slump6s for a minute 💀
God bless that young man!
I was raised like this too, back then we had money to afford basic necessities, and helped allot of our relatives. 20 years later, we hit middle life crisis. We were so poor that a bag of 0nions fell of the road, my mom picked it up and brought it home, it thorn my heart but at the same time thank God from the bottom of my heart. You see being good and kind comes in different form.
Let him clap dem cheeks.
Dude wanted money....Please.....where is commonsense these days ?
Plot twist he stole it just to do this. Also you got this type of money to spare but not an AirTag in there? Dumb
Nahh
What gets me though is this used to be just the normal thing to do, not the exceptional.
Happy that they rewarded him. Guys like him want to do the right thing anyway but it feels god to know that he had some god things for his justice soul in this life to and not have to wait for it all until the judgementday. That day i think he get a ewen bigger reward. Gretings from Sweden.
🧡🧡🧡
That’s cool and all, but the media doesn’t need to blow this up, lol.  Dude was just being a naturally good guy.
Wow! This young man just did something amazing.
Y'all got any missing purses? 🧍‍♀️
Dude you're a hero. Keep that in your heart.
he is so fineeee
So awesome something good honesty still exist. That was awesome this good Samaritan was generously rewarded for what he did. His mom raised him right.💝
This is God's original design for how humanity is meant to be,  I call it the God factor,  Not the religious factor (always wanting your money).
This young man is amazing for being a Good Samaritan! This makes me have some faith in humanity his momma def raised him right ❤️
Looks so dead in the inside
The fact that people asked “why did you return the purse”  This shows how little faith we have in society.   Awesome job mate.
Good boy! 👍
We need some good news. God bless this young man.  Stay good in this world and hang on to what is  best inside   Don’t let life’s hardships destroy what is good in you.
I’m glad she got her purse back but did anyone notice about her neck? Look like she has a lump
Bro I love how casual he looks at the door
Damn I did that once and got a hug lol 3k sounds nice, atta boy
The aunt is fine asf
Wow he's going to be a good man!!! We need a lot more honest people in this world!!!!
Great young man
I say that to my kids all the time, your justification is then no one is watching you!  I’m so happy his mommy said that to him too
RESPECT
Fake
And he’s fine 🤭
that kid was raised right
He returned that ass. Hopefully he stays in the straight and narrow.
I just found a purse a couple days ago & took it back into the theater. They'll probably just toss it, but it had the id inside with everything else.
ADRIAN? KICK BACK ADRIAN?????
And they say good guys always finish last
lol 420 liekls
That's how you know the country is in a messed up state, they have to ask the question, "why would you return the purse!?" I guess doing the right thing has gone the way of the dodo bird.
Jesus is the way the truth and the life and the only way to receive salvation and the only way to heaven💗
WHAT A GIGACHAD! +9999999999999 social credit!
Beautiful young man this is how I've raised my daughter to be. God is good 👍🏻👍🏻
Omg cutest sweetest guy ever for doing this
He’s fine too
What a amazing young man
Look at his dress code , Alot of you would call that a “Gangster” ……. Whos a fool now ? Stay real my bro.
I want part 2 you know what I’m saying
Sometimes it starts with one
Big brody should’ve got at women with black hair
he’s so fine 🌚
foo saw the ID n said hol up 💀
What a good vibes ❤️
I did that the other day with someone’s phone
I returned a missing credit card. Give me a medal!
AWESOME ☺️
His mom raised him right.   I hope others follow in his footsteps.
Real one🤝💯
Normal in Nz
Brooooo that’s a blessing from God fr Thank God g
That young man should have asked the lady out for dinner. She is SMOKING.
I remember I found a £10 note in school once and gave it to the teacher then I got rewarded a certificate for it 😳
Tan bello dios lo bendiga I bet his mom is so freaking proud
My dude be like: Do things even if no one's watching  the girls: *puts him on the news*  Dude no one wants to be on the news unless your an idiot or Kim Kardashian.
Look At GOD!!!!
Need more teens like him in this world REAL ISH
Be good parents, he will pass this down to his kids too.  It starts by being a good parent
I did the same thing found a debit card, decided not to be a moron like other teen robbers, and brought the card back to the originating bank.
NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S COVER ❤
Go fund me is for people who want money to motivate them not to steal, and to start being decent people… good job young sir
This made me tear up
Kuddos to his mom for raising such an honorable son. More parents need to take a lesson out of that handbook.
Angel ❤️
Good kid
Plot twist: he stole it and just returned it like he found it
Awesome job young man, and what an amazing mom you have for raising you the way she did, with integrity.  We need more young men in the world like you.
okay but hes fine
He prolly stole it and got scared
bro rly did a side quest irl
what a chad
Thats awesome
I live in Detroit and I had lost my wallet at a gas station.   .... this dude showed up at my house and gave me my wallet... I'll never forget that.
I left a $500 bag with $200 cash and a $80 gift card inside in a cart. I was stoned and listening to music. I thought I heard someone yelling that I left a bag. But I thought to myself “I got all my groceries and the toilet paper, must not be me”
My heartttt 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
he fine asf i wish it was my purse
This kid makes me jelous.
Bravo! Love hearing about honesty... he did it for honest reasons, not expecting anything in return, and was rewarded nicely. Awesome!
Back in 2018 when I used to stay in Brampton I found a lady's purse and after I had opened it I found an id I walked like 2 miles to return it to the address but no one answered the door at 2 am so I kept it at the doorstep. Still dont know if she found it
Good job, young man. There is still hope for the future.
ONE IN A MILLION!
whoever does good, meets well!
Eliana look scary af
NUH he only returned it cause she peng xd
We need more people like him, sadly we don’t have many
What’s the world come to if you can’t return a purse without all this social media funding and over the top thanking, nice kid by the way returning it but come on get a grip
W
The women also had a surprise for him… 😏
well theres a diffrence bettween find 20$ on the ground and a purse which could be someones whole life... like documents, cards etc, I would do the same and deliver it back or at least tell the security that someone left it.
The fact that this is considered "news" is weird to me.
Good man, beautiful parents.
Bless this young man for doing his good deeds in life and may our god watch over him and keep him protected and blessed🙏💙🙏💯💁👍❤
GTA be like
That is so sweet...
Not to be judgmental but he looks like he on a whole lot of Gang ish 😅
Comes down from parenting.... now u guys know why kids out there so bad??? Cuz no parenting......
Me and mom did this over a year ago and got nothing 😂😂..Good job bro ‼️💯
Kudos to this young man👍❤️😀. His parents raised him well and he's certainly a wonderful person.
As someone whose lost their wallet it feels good when someone does the right thing
Love him!!😍😍❤❤
Take is easy on the lip filler
Good! This is a real man.
faze rug
That was the right thing to do young man.always do right and good things with happen to you.
Now find mine 🤨
Down ass vato
now this is news
That everyone is wondering that he brought it back, makes me wonder the most... Americans....
niceeee
He def deserved the reward😍 so nice to see positive!!
Fair play to the guy. Actually went out of his way to return it.. His folks managed to do a good job. Bless em all.
Yeah Yeah, now im guessing if they can afford to dole out 3k they probably have a fantastic house which he can see as he walks up. Would he do the same if it was a bombsite?
Dude I did the same thing and the lady didn’t even know she left it at the store 😆
We don't need more people like him, we need to become like him.
The definition of don't judge by its cover
Damn, she's hot
W kid
Sweet story! Blessed be to all 💙💜
It was all a dream
This ruins any hope by making it a shocking thing that people can be nice?
Salute to this teenage boy and to his good mother.
I would’ve swiped all her cards then return it that’s just me tho
He did the right thing what his mother taught. He has been rewarded that is also a nice moving. 👏
That is a fine young man. His mom brought him up well... Thanks to all those people that chipped in to reward him. Bless you guys! Love and peace ❤️✌️
Yet probably gets judged by the way he looks.
He's fit he needed a good bonk as a reward lol
Bless him
Someone robbed my snowboard and skis I am giving $5k for the person who brings me the thief
Just think how different our world would be if the media focused more on stories like this than all the hateful negative lying the do every day!! This kind of thing happens much more often than we know!!
When you’re brown or black it’s a miracle.  When you’re white it’s normal
Bro breakin every stereotype associated with his fit, mad respect to bro😤
Even when no one is looking... is the most important part. Bravo
few and far between
It's always refreshing watching news like this every once in a while.
aye my name is Adrian  rodriguez 😭😭
If he were white he'd have got no reward
He’s fine
My man was sagging hard
This reminds me of Dahr Mann
bro wanted to hit that, same tho
👏🏻
Yesssssss I’m so happy he was rewarded 💜💜💜💜 Thank you God 🙏 I have seen people do this and get nothing even though it doesn’t belong to them, but still they deserve something.
Still good people in the world
Naw he saw the id and said imma hit that🥴
He’s a credit to his parents! Great lad
The definition of INTEGRITY should be this young man's face.
I can't believe that woman didn't even give him ten bucks when he brought it back!
Fake she keep the money
Quite insane that in 2022 we start a gofundme for someone returning a purse. What has this world turned in to 😂
I Hope hes in college now
And most people would think of how that kid dresses is he is up to no good. Great job, kid! Keep being a good person.
👍😊
Bruh, he stole it. Then returns it and then gets payed for it? Man if I had known if I steal stuff and given it back I'm sure I would have been repayed back too
Guy got VERY Good Mamma.
Mom raised an awesome young man.
probably a head by both would have made him more happy
i thiight the title was gonna be “Foo pulls up with a purse, ends up dead”
There’s still a lot of us out there with good hearts who try our best to do the right things in this life 💙
Kind of sad that something that should happen everyday makes local news.
How much money was in the purse to where they gave him $3,000?
Nice
To the people who said they would steal it , man’s got a go fund me now and is big rich so you always gotta do the right thing cuz one day you’ll get much more out of just pickpocketing
We all know he was just trying to hit
Plastic
Wow I'm touched, his mama is proud of him
"Honesty is its own reward" is also good parenting.  Still a great story though.
he spent the 3k on drugs and glocks 😭
She should have took that money to get a better plastic surgeon
Pretty sad we live in a world where mere decency is congratulated.
Talking about younger generation 😂😂 she ain’t doing that for no black kids almost gareentee that
Great story
W kid
a lot of terrible stuffs happening in the world  and watching this  gives me hope ☺️
Beautiful. Respect to this man
I bet he stole the purse, found nothing in it and returned it hoping to get more!
Good kid
He fine
S
This sweet boy❤️❤️❤️❤️ His mama and dad raised him good❤️
That dude deserved the clout😂
Awesome work my guy👌
See how kind he is this what people should do!
His hot too😍😍‼️
HES FINEEE
Awesom!
I'm sorry but it looks likes he's trying a little too hard
hes so adorableeeee
I returned a wallet and I got 60 dollars!! 🎉
I'm more surprised about how this is such big deal. When I returned a wallet noone cares lol
As simple as do the right thing. Thank You Adrian Rodriguez.  Keep those morals Alive, pass them on. Chingon.
Way to go Adrian.
hes fine
Not only does that speak volume for that young man…. It speaks volumes of his mother…family..and influences he had to guide him!!!!
The fact that he didn’t care about being identified says everything about him. Universe willing, he’s going to have a good life.
gigachad
He probably was the one who stole it and felt bad so he returned it
he’s so fine
me personally bro i might need to cash out
Nice of him
great love ta hear this
Talk about incentiving people to follow in his footsteps.
Hallelujah! 😃🙌🏻
Go home
What he bangs? 😭
scratch that, somebody get me his @
The funny thing is he is exactly the kind of person someone would profile as being a criminal. Lucky for him, the "wrong" kind of cop didn't see him carrying the purse.
Great young man I glad his mom raised him right
Plot twist, der was no money in the purse. Just her ID and some lipstick.
I hope some people take note of this because I am sure some people could dismiss him because of the way he looks (which is fine to me but I know people judge). What a cool guy. So glad he got a reward.
I lost my wallet a month ago and last week someone found me on Facebook and returned it! Nothing missing!🔥💯
Wow!!! This was fabulously Awesome! Outstanding young Man. 👏👏👍💖🙏
he so fine
He cute
Her aunt is so fine
👏👏👏👏
Crazy how common decency is hard to find now a days
Fake
Outstanding story. Good to hear instead of blood and guts.
Wow good man
Theres hope for our young generation lmaoooo no bih he didn’t want karma
:)
That a great person right there
That's a real pimp right there
Why didn't they interview the 17 year old?
Solid dude. Good on him for doing the right thing.
Plot twist: He stole it and waited a few days to return it for a reward
He looked at the drivers license he trying to smash.
it's funny cause in finland 9/10 times someone returns a purse or a wallet.
That's what's up my young man
Young man Rumble God is Smiling
Awesome!
Nah I would take it
I’m proud of him and he’s not even my son.
We need more of this and less drama making the news
He def did it cuz he saw a milf on the drivers license
That mf that returned it prob the one who stole it 😂
"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." 💯
Mission Passed Respect+
losing all your cards and phone is sooo annoying too, take you like a year and a half to get back to where you were
Yay!! 🥳🥳 more of THIS news please!! 🙏🏽❤️🙌🏾❤️
we need him to teach this to even adults
That is so so sweet it gave me some tears ( I’m pretty strong with m feelings) I wish him the best luck 🍀 thru out his life. Fortunes will go his way.  My husband and I do thank people like Him ($200- or more $$ on tipping)  😊
He got the cash and a little something in the house
the boys know why
I'VE NEVERENDING COMMENTED ON THIS PG BUT IT CAME UP ON MY SUGGESTIONS WHEN I SEEN THIS STORY IT GAVE ME CHILLS A HONEST BSBY DOING THE RIGHT THING AS HE WAS TAUGHT TO DO I'M PROUD OF YHIS YOUNG MAN & GLAD THAT HE WAS RECOGNIZED BLESS HIS HEART
I would’ve been okay wit sum head but 3k good 2 😂😵‍💫
I found a wallet once on a Friday night...I bought drugs with their money and used their ID to line up the drugs and their passport to snort it with. I thank that person for a blessed wonderful Friday night.
I returned a bag with alot of money once,she thought I stoll it and almost went to jail
Always good to see a Rodriguez do right in this world and get noticed for it.
He’s fine asf
Good mama
We know what he was doing 😏
woow
I mean he does drive a nice audi he prolly doesnt need the 3k
He seen that id n was tryna Holla let's be honest 🤣
Dan and Riya fans: WOW! Cinnamon’s brother she has a brother
Ah hell yeaaa
When you a drug dealer and wash your money publicly
thats great and all but his A3 seems pretty nice
God will reward him sevenfold. We need more people like him.
Goated💯
Wait he didn’t commit a crime?
Good ese
He’s hitting
What a sweetheart ❤️
Never judge a book by its cover
So awesome.  Now, he can use the money to buy some clothes that fit him.  :o
looking at the kid you’d never think he was such a sweetheart
Am I the only one who think he wanna smash the person who owns the purse
He’s so fine
I bet he seen the id nd was js tryna shoot his shot💀
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
His mama raised him right! To be honest and responsible. Doing the right thing when no one is looking is called CHARACTER & INTEGRITY.
This is so nice ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️
Looks like a hoodlum
Great Job Young Man! I'm Proud Of You!
w man
She a cougar for sureee lol
👏 bravo
May be he was just waiting for the reward to get to 3k 😹 and then showed up. Sorry for this but it's on a lighter note.
What a nice young man, we need more like this kid!
That is the kind of kid I would want my son to be!!!!!!!
awh🥹
Good kid, his future will be blessed
Imagine if the dude stole it, saw the reward, and returned it immediately 😂😂
Thats a GTA 5 mission in real life
Buddy look like a thug
I wanna watch them to get their bag back
Wait but he’s kinda cute 🥴
I'm surprised she didn't accuse him of stealing it guess all women aren't  that bad 🤔
Kid returned 1500 dollars worth of stuff at most and got double it for being a good samaritan, do get get treated good, maybe not right away but it will come.
What a nice boy👌
He didn’t find anything worth taking
Good for this young man
Yeah I did this once and didn’t even get a thank you. :/
Bro gotta got and hit 4k from women. Living the dream.
He just made 15k from doing the right thing
WOW
He handsome Ngl.
15 000$ GoFundMe as we speak
How much is the gofundme now?
Woow
Thank God Good Honest People Still Exist in Selfish World 🌎
The definition of integrity right there.
God's blessings 🙌
😊 love it
Always do the right thing when no one is watching.
Oh he lit . 3k plus . Kno he cruising w the windows down
Happy to see sweet videos coming to light instead of always bad things
Awesome 👏🏾
I'm feeling optimistic about our future all of a sudden
I'd rather have a 3sum than 3k..
Imagine if we all had this mindset, there wouldnt be anymore problems in our world. And yes, I say our world, because its our world thats messed up.
I've actually had people go out of their way to let me know that I had left my wallet at their store. When they couldn't reach me, they contacted other people with the same last name as me in hopes they knew me. The world is still good!! Thank you, young man for doing what you're intended to do. 💕
He deff was tryna smash that lol
The way the second girl talks stress me out.
The go fund me say “fine young man “💀
Low key he just wanted 2 jam auntie
That’s why you do good things for people always return peoples property never know what’s going to happen
Good young man 💪
he saw picure of the latin girl and thought he could hit tell the truth lol
I get what he said about his mom telling him do the right thing even if nobody's looking. My mother always said the same.its only happend to me twice but iv sent 2 wallets in package mail to 2 different people in my lifetime. Received thankyou cards later. That was good enough for me.. good stuff young man.
Good lad 😀👍
i really don't get the obsession with americans having cameras filming
Bro saw the ID and was tryna smack
Amazing young man
Flipscript: both milfs do him ⬛️⬛️🟧
💯💯🫡
Good Karma
That’s the definition of integrity
This dude is well deserved for 3k 💪💪💪
The fact that this act is shocking, just shows the world we live in.
Wonderful story ♡
When doing the normal right thing becomes breaking news ; tells you what kinda world we live in.
I'm a natural cynic so I can't help but wonder what he would have done if a dude or unattractive female was on the ID.  In his head he was showing up with a delivery pizza and she was going to answer the door in a towel after leaving the shower.  Or he's just a good dude.  One of those two.  lol
Amen
He did his good deed for the year.
This is what raising your kid right looks like. Good job to his parents
Who’s the aunt her or her
i woulda been like lemme crack
Did he steal it first?
What's her @?
i would do the same and plus it feels good having good integrity
Lovely looking lad  also  aswell  as being a good honest young man. Well done  to his  mother  she did well bringing him up But that was his own doing that's a gentleman. He went out of his way to drive to the house .we need more young men like this .
As if this is real.
Perfect
Wow !!! That's Beautiful!

Keep everything aside the aunt was sexy 😗
That foo did a good deed for sure
Things like this gives me hope in America
If I show my Aunt the picture of this guy, she'd definitely say "do not to be like him... Blah blah blah"
Good job buddy we need more like him. An it just shows dont judge someone by age or looks cause you may be surprised!
This is a wonderful story but the only thing that bothered me was the title of the fundraiser, it would be better if the GoFundMe title gave more credit to him and not his parents. Some people have awful parents and still end up good people while some people have amazing parents and still end up bad people.
Yass 👏 family values thought u a lot
$3k??  I want Eliana's digits as my reward instead
🙏🏽👍🏽💯
SiMPLY amazing young man and sweet actions of reward from them to him. May God bless them all 🙏
Maybe there is hope for this generation
It’s refreshing to watch this after just saw a video of 3 women trashed the fries fast food in LES over $1.75.  It gives our society a little hope! Go young fella
“Ayy foo you left your purse in the parking lot guey”
He didnt "went out of his way" imo
Props to his mom for raising a good young man! He's already doing great in this world!
He saw the pretty face on the ID and was hoping she would take a tip not give it nawmean
1:25 wtf is she saying
He just wanted to hit
He doesn’t look like someone who would return a purse 😊
Good job buddy we need more people like you 👍👍🤟✌️
skrapa azz foo 🤣
How nice of all the friends chipping in to reward this nice young man!☮️❤️
About time now there's a good kid Amen good job kid...!
Plot twist, he had seen the house before, new they had a ring cam, and knew their family often used GoFundMe for donations to others. Planned the whole thing 🤭🤭
Great young man.  We need more decent men like this. from Liverpool England 🇬🇧 😊❤
I once lost my wallet at carwash and someone gave it to police and police returned it to me 🥺
REAL NEWS
You don’t need rewards for that you just need others to share that story…glad it made the news though.
Over 15k at the moment! How good.
11 million in 8 days that's insane.
This is just bad financial decisions.
Wholesome
The world is so messed up that good deeds like this have to be a shocking news
That's awesome.
Imagine he just took a 20$ 😭
bro was just tryna hit😭😭
Little did he know we s watching him
So happy for this young man!
My 19 yr old son would have done the exact same thing, 100% positive. 💕
If you're going to forget your purse and let it lay around with all your personal information and money in it I don't know how many people would actually return it especially if there was a lot of money ever left in it I picked up a lot of money before off the ground and there was this one envelope at Walmart years ago that had over $3,000 on it I figured so what do I do do I take it to customer service or do I keep it well I decided to hold on to it but I did bring it up to customer service and a week went by I went back to my local Walmart and I asked if anybody cleaned it they said no and they said I needed the return it to them so they could report it to the police or give it to him so to say but nobody at Walmart ever came back asking for it and I'm like no because if nobody claims it and you guys don't actually call the police you're going to pocket it anyway until this day nobody's bugging me about it since nobody ever came back to Walmart and asked about it or anything like that I mean maybe there's really rich people out there and they'll be like now it's only $3,000 no biggie. it's crazy how people can forget their wallets and purses especially a person how do you forget that and a shopping cart like it's something you carry around with you all the time you get all the way back home and still don't remember like thank God
Oh please one look at the house and perhaps the amount of cash you had on that purse he was definitely expecting compensation
The day good people met one another.
He did the right thing and God blessed him. Cause ive NEVER heard about no person gettin over 3k for returning a damn purse bruh. I really hope it’d be the same situation for anyone else that wouldve done it🤷🏾‍♂️
Lovely mercy room
Good job!
Did they let him hit tho
I would do it and I wouldn't expect anything in return. I just don't like accepting from anyone.
So kind
Bro this guy found her I'd and was like she's hot maybe I have a chance haha
What a great country where 2-3 times the general public does something normal, it gets into the top news across the country.
Do the right thing! He will be blessed foreverrrr pure heart of Gold!
Man saw the picture on the ID and wanted to hit definitely hahah
Such a good man🫶
Get out of jail free card
Fine young man. Good parents. Good to see.
This young kid us a great human being
Blows my mind that someone would actually take it instead. I found a chunky wallet at a bus stop once, it had cash and cards. Info was outdated but managed to phone a contact for them. They gave me the address and it ended up being a little old lady who forgot it. She was watching Countdown at the time 😅
How sad these people and the people watching this video think this is such a big deal. It's so sad because it should just be normal. There should be nothing special about this... What a sad sad day we live in.
What sad world where honesty, decency etc is so surprising that it comes on tv.
you inspired me young bro 🤜🤛
If it wasn't for her friend, she wouldn't give a guy nothing. What a b!@tch... People who doesn't give something in return to people who find their stuff should never get their stuff back. I lost my wallet in a bus 4-5 years ago, guy found me on Facebook and returned me my wallet. I had only around 30$ in it at the moment, so I gave all 30$ to him because he deserves it. Shout out to all people who do good like this guy and all people who respect those people🙏🏻
Why cover this as if it's unusual?  This is actually very basic stuff, it's called being a decent person.  Only scumbag pieces of garbage would find someone's stuff and keep it.
Sweeeet news❤ I hope every day these kind of news broadcast ❤
That young man has what's called CHARACTER. I would say God bless him but He already has.
Salute bro. You know he checked the ID and was like “she kinda fine too” lemme pull up 🤣
She doesn't know he stole her bag and said it was in a parking lot.
I'm excited for this new generation🙌
lets make the dude rich
These women should have paid from their own pockets. Gofundme is a horrible thing beggin for cash
When you steal epic games logo...........
Staged and fake
He a good one
Good Lad 👍🙏

Young man would make a great Marine

There's already 15k funded, what a pleasure to see this. This young man and his family deserve it all.
Well deserved

He probably wanted to get domed up
This is definitely Ring commercial in my opinion, definitely doesn’t look genuine!!
Hey
But is there hope in the older generation?
anyone here need their purse found? hmu
Hear me out- he can blow my back ou-
Great young man. Thank you
Good job kid
Good dude!
Up to 15k

Nice to see an uplifting story
An honest young man

Shi and he fine too
Did he receive the 3k or not wtf
Let's Go
what a man. good man!
He was raised with great values. Now he's going to be blessed for it!😃
Definition of don’t judge people by their appearances
"always do the right thing, even when no one is watching", thats my new motto from now on.
More stories, like this, need to be magnified, promoted and given a bright light. ESPECIALLY when involving POC.  I love this and appreciate that young man for being an example and a symbol of honesty and trustworthiness. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾  Hats-off to his parents, as well, for raising him the right way. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I’m so grateful for a positive news story like this instead of all the negative stuff out there
That kid was raised very amazingly, hope he grows to have a great life
Cool dude much respect
I really hope he got to tap them cougars 😮‍💨
So nice :)
Being rewarded for doing the normal thing lmao
he's fine too
Wow
Amen
she’s bad i would have returned it too
May God bless you and guide you young man. I wish you the very best in life.

I know he clapped after that
He looks like the type that would usually steal it 😂
bro yall need to stop being so extra. This is literally just a basic life skill. Some people don't have basic life skills. But this is just basic manners which is considered normal. Nothing to praise about. I don't believe in praising for doing "good tasks".
He just realized the pros of a good deed
Amen , for more acts like this 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Love this!!!!! What an awesome story
Oh he fine
They gonna get acquainted lol
Sadwhen
Bro did a side quest lol.  Fr tho super cool guy!

What a great role model for young kiddos , Great Job to his momma! You raised a great young man!  He will go far!
What a great man
Adrian is fine
Look at god showing out.👏🏽
It only made head lines because he looks hood af.
He saw her ID and said "Oh I got to"
Nice humans nice reward we need more inspiring stories like this one!
He shot his shot
Plot twist. he brought it back because there wasnt anything worth stealing from it inside.
Wow
Looking how he is dressed somewhere else he would be thought of as a thug but like they say never judge a book by its cover good job young man your mom taught you well 🙏🏼
his mama raised him right
Lmfao he saw she a milf it doesn’t count lmfao
Fake...Ty
Dude takes the cash out of the purse, returns the purse and makes more cash. Hustler in the making right here, he will do amazing things in real estate.
she get moke😂
When I become a parent  I will also teach my child to always do the right thing even when no one's watching. Wow, words really do have an impact in their young minds!
Now why can’t news stations share more stories like this because it happens ALL THE TIME in the United States! It happens in my world daily, I see it a lot!
To that young man, good for you bro!! You deserve to be blessed.
She should have let him have them cheeks.
This is so Beautiful 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾 May he remain Covered and so blessed in life!
Thats an amazing story ❤
Omg, I love this story!
if she was ugly he would've kept everything lol
to be honest i would've probably been scared to go near the purse in case it was a bomb....scary world, but good for him.
This is awesome!!!
she's in love
They need to stop fronting on fake acting.
Post the gofundme in description
Always do the right thing and he did it and God and other people reward him..
He only did that cause she hella fine haha no Cap
Its about time good people have good things happen to them instead of the bad guys gettin it
Sweet
Of course there’s hope.
What a sweetheart
He just buy a ps5 before xD
I've found 4 phones, here and there. Returned all of them and never accepted the $20, $20 and $100 they offered...
He wanted to return her purse after he saw her ID 🪪 😏
i know that one person that saw that purse and ignored it is crying rn
Don't  thank him. Thank his parents.
Sick foo

gta random event moment
Super kind. At that age I saw a purse in a parking lot but I didn’t want to go through it and just took back it to the store to customer service
Awe 🥺🥺🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽
Que buen muchacho 👍😇
Integrity, what we need in these times,  god bless my boy.
You know it's sad when simply doing the right and returning someone's lost property makes national news...
Bros screamin INTEGRITY!!!💯 Bros definitely putting on for my generation and all the other youngins with us
GOD was already gon bless him but  God always test our integrity for the blessing to come .. hint it wasn't the 3k ... That was just the beginning
Humility still exist
Didn’t another teen return like 300k worth of money and he got 500??
There’s hope for this generation but it’s mostly gone
✝️✝️✝️✝️
cool
Nah he stole dat shii den felt bad IM JPPPP YALL
he fine
*His Parents Did A Great Job & He Listened & Respected Them.*
This is feel scripted
don’t judge a book by its cover
💯❤️
See kids this is why you do good stuff but even if you don’t even get a reward It at least feels good knowing you did the right thing 😊 😌 💖.      -Some advice to live by-
Kudos my fellow young man, honesty goes a long way
shot sounds so fake 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm also 17. Anyone knows his @? just research purposes... 😳💗
I returned my door dashers wallet thinkin I would get this type of love 😂 but I am still broke
A good example of why you should never judge a book by its cover. I used to dress similar in high school, baggy sagging pants, backwards hat, etc. and I've actually had people act like I was going to steal something and just generally treat me like I was a scumbag for no reason, even going as far as calling the police. The cop that showed up literally said that someone called on us because my friends and I "looked like lowlifes that were up to no good." All we were doing was walking to a friends house after school, and in actuality we were all good students who rarely got into even minor trouble. One of the friends that was with me is actually a cop now and told me that he gets tons of calls for stuff like that. He told me that one time he got called out for some kids hanging out skateboarding in an empty parking lot. He said he showed up, talked to the kids for a few minutes, did a kickflip in uniform and then proceeded to tell the lady that called that they were well mannered and were doing nothing wrong and "could be out committing real crimes, getting high, or playing video games inside all day long." I love seeing people do good like this, and honestly this kid is a better person than many adults twice his age.
Good things happened to Good People📝
This really made me happy, what a wonderful person <33
Feel good vibez
No one cares lol 🤣 so what if a cholo returned a purse 😂😂😂😂😂 dammn all you guys get wet over that. Lmao 🤣
I found a woman's wallet outside the grocery store one day.  I looked in it to get the name woman's name and saw she had at least 2 to 300 in the wallet, just a guesstimate.  So I went in and went straight to the customer service desk and ask that they please page this lady and they did. I aksed who she was and I told her that I found her wallet outside and here it is...do you know that this woman took the wallet, walked away and never said thank u...oh well...can't please everyone...even with all her money still in the wallet
Good job, lil guy!  I bet, you made ur momma proud!
All the BLM should learn from this young Good Samaritan , way to go bro 👍👍👍👍
he bangs
Whoopty do, he did the right and civil thing. Do you want to give him a medal too. Pretty pathetic that something as miniscule as this makes "news".
Good news story 😊. I love this.
I would’ve been good with a date with auntie so caliente 🔥
About five years ago, I had just moved to a new city by myself. It was my first time living on my own and paying all my own bills. I was a waitress at the time and had gotten home late after a busy Friday night at work. The next morning, rent was due and my wallet with 850$ in cash in it was missing.  I only found this out because the office at my apartment complex called me to say someone turned had turned it in.  I was SHOCKED to say the least because I didn't know I had dropped my wallet and I didn't have any other money to pay my rent. I go up to the office to get my wallet just knowing all my cash was gone and there it was. All 850$! Due to privacy laws, they couldn't give me the woman's name who turned it in but the office said they could give her something from me.  I got her a thank you card with a giftcard in it and left my phone number.  She called me to thank me and we ended up being great friends. When I thanked her for my wallet she said "of course. Why would I take it. It's not mine. ❤️
W kid
he was tryna get laid 🤣
good on you bro and good on them for not judging a book by its cover
My man’s🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is why people shouldn't stereotype about our urban youth with pants sagging, gold chains, or wearing a hat to the back.  It's a fashion statement, not something you should use to gauge a person's morals and character.  This is an example of that.  Definitely an upstanding young man.  If I had a daughter, this is the kind of young man I'd encourage her to befriend.
Did you get your 10 m plaque yet ?
Him returning the purse got him probably 20 times more than what was in the purse, had he kept it
I love hearing about young people going out of their way in order to do the right thing.  Amazing parents obviously
Wow this is so sweet!
❤️❤️❤️
👍
He is definitely different from today's Tiktok generation. Congratulations to him.
He’s the one that probably stole it lol
“Always do the right thing, even when no one is watching.” The world will be happier place.
my beautiful girly on the left: I'm not sure if you'll see this but pls get your thyroid checked. It looks like you have a goiter at some angles. Love n peace!
no cap she should tha nih hit after tha
Good man.
I did the same thing but with a smartphone
Awesome story.
That ring doorbell 💀💀💀
blessings bro
This wonderful boy deserves a full college scholarship!   He is the hope for the future!
Yay good job mr Rodriguez there is still good people out here and I thank you for doing the right thing. May God continue to bless you.
He can have me with that 3.7k cuz WHEW he fine (I’m 17 btw😭)
That’s what I’m talking about 🙌🏻🔥
For some reason i feel like if this was a woman, this wouldnt be on the news.
Do the right thing regardless, the only reason why this became viral is because it was shared and the boy got a nice reward.
He would not return it if they were not Latinos
I've returned a lot of important lost items to their rightful owners. Where's my GoFundMe campaign? Oh I didn't record it which means it never happened. Ppl getting rewards for doing what they should do means it's becoming rare for ppl to return lost items
Good young man! Keep it up beautiful guy!
That's like only like < 5%
Thank you for being you. A good man
Big respect. What's his @ on Instagram
Black man wouldn’t have gotten anything but the cops called on em 🤦🏾‍♂️
It's over $15k now 😲
I remember once at school finding a loaded ass wallet. All my friends told me to take the money which I literally couldn’t believe. From the place where I found I def knew it belonged to a freshman. I gave it to a janitor and she belittled me for it lol. So much for doing the right thing.
10 bucks says he saw the picture on that milfs license and was hoping to score. 😂
This brought tears to my eyes - Such a great young man, destined for greatness!!!! ❤
Bros a better man then me
zahir zaman Zaman
It's very rare to see young people like him do what's right these days. Luckily for them that purse didn't end up in the wrong hands.
fake
BRAVO to the parents raising such a wonderful young man! 💜😄👏
W
Nice to see some good in this world!
Integrity goes A LONG WAY.
May God bless him 🙏 Amen
Well done to Adrian
Sounds like a Brazzers scene
Moms?
he fine too
Great and good people comes in all colors. Two beautiful families
I would’ve tried for some head too
A true test of a person is what they do when nobody is watching. Good for this little guy.💟
Such a lovely story. My mom has always thought of the same thing and I am always careful with what is mine and what isn't even if it's a single grain of rice (no exaggeration).
I would have returned it too just to get them digits! 😂
Mom must be very proud , I’m sure he makes her proud every day ❤️god bless and pay it forward
"Always do the right thing, even when no one is watching"  That's the oposite of what most of us would do...  I said "most of us", but really I meant most of you😅 Because I'm just that awesome and honest
Most kids/teens would have just thrown it in the trush just because.Well done young man, always do the right thing even if no one is watching.
Meanwhile a rich kid is depressed because he can't get laid so he shoots up innocent people.. Good parenting goes a long way. Teaching kids at an early age morals and values is the change we need. Passing new laws will not change their corrupted minds.
he's driving an 80k car I think that was a pretty ez decision for him not to steal a purse
Character!
Before my dad died he left his wallet in a store with 500 dollars. The shop keep gave it to him when he went back later for groceries. My dad then gave 100 dollars to the lady that found his wallet. He also told me if you borrow money from a friend, you always pay back a little more out of respect. I am 39 and I can relate to this kid because he followed his parents advice. I forgot to mention no money was missing in my dads wallet. My dad was ate up with liver cancer and he died not long after. I'm glad to see young people do the right thing. We live in bad times.
Good on him and good on his parents. They have a young man to be proud of right there!
One philosophy says this was a selfish act. You feel good for getting all the praise for doing the right thing, so you did it to feel good, you were selfish. I bet most of you hate that.
Not if he's the one who stole it in the first place, my point is he did it for .1 clout, .2 a reward, or .3 there was nothing good in the purse to take anyways
Trust me there is no hope.
Im never gona steal purses again
Excuse me how did you get rich?    Well....... I went to rich neighborhoods and returned a bunch of purses.
Wish I could be 17 and innocent
He's so handsome, I love him. What his name?
Good for him!  I would've done the same thing!  I'm sure the ladies were very grateful & his mother must be so proud of him.
I’m glad they rewarded bro 😎💯
I love this 🥲
Too much wholesomeness now back to the war in Ukraine
this is the definition of Good News
Bro really pulled up in a r8 and they give him 3k
God bless him more raise by a great mother
Bro for sure got head after that
Kids got integrity. His parents raised him right
I notice he didn't just return the purse and go - he was hanging around.  Hoping for a reward?!
This is news in the US? this is common practice here in Japan.
My niggaz bringing hope back 🙏🏻 💯 💪
Always do the right thing even when no one’s watching, the police could do with hearing this
Look at Ji doing the right thing
Thanks for his parents for teaching him the right way...
Alright sooo, you gonna invite me in for the gawk gawk 3000 now huh?
This somewhat happened to me, couple weeks ago I had lost my wallet at a Home Depot. After looking all over the place and in my car I called over to HD to find out someone had turned it into the lost and found with nothing missing from it.  I've done similar good deeds before in hopes that if it's ever myself, someone would return the favor. In this case they did🙏
Exactly the kind of thing someone would set up to make up money off of softies who believe everything. They scammed you.
The fact that good gestures make headlines breaking news should be a wake up call for humanity
Nice of her to spend some money on him instead of those bad fillers.
I KNOW THAT MONEY CAME IN RIGHT ON TIME 🗣🕺🏾💯👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🙏🏾💯
Stunna gambino
This goes to show that some times the biggest score comes when you do whats right.  Cause had he stole what he found he would gotten away with $100 maybe. He did right and walked away with more than $3500
good men listen to their mothers
But he's blacck
That’s amazing
It's sad that doing the right thing is shocking.
Next time he be coming for more 😭
Pov:he stole it
Fraier
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
"Always do the right thing, even when no ones is watching" that is a very good moto to live by. I wish more people in this world thought this way, the parents of that young lad needs to be so proud of him and be safe in the knowledge that they have raised a wonderful young man.
he really is fineee😍
Yes
Good foomaritian
Don’t give rich people back their personal property🤣👌🏻
He was looking for a happy ending
So they rewarded him $3k and kept the rest 😂
Can you please lose your purse again so I can go find it and bring it back to you?
It is a sad world that we live in. Doing the right thing is now headline news. smh
He seen shawty was bad then got all fly an brought her purse back😂😂💯
He’s fine asf
he so drippy as well
YES! 🎯 "Integrity Matters", I love hearing stories like this for people who have morals and respect for others. Take notes men...
He definitely smashed.
Just show the surveillance video..
And he fine asf too 😮‍💨
Hes fine too and also good and nice person.
Awesome job my dude
Whole time he stole it🫢 stay woke
Doing the right thing  always  brings unexpected  blessings 🙌 🙏  doing  the right things shows GOD ALWAYS HAS HUMAN ANGELS 😇 ON ASSIGNMENTS AT ALL TIMES!!!
U know when i gave u my golden scar 😉
Maaaan why can’t I get this lucky😭
Bless him
You know he saw Eliana's license and went there to smash 🤣
" We know what you did last summer" Something is always watching.
Good kid
If it happened to you you'd hope that someone would go out of their way to help you out. Treat others as you want to be treated.
Good kid right here!
He deserved a reward for being a good individual. He returned her purse honesty.
why tf is this video so loud
Bro fs got to clap
Weird but  so cool
Goated
Solid kid
They need to show more of this !!!
Living proof that an overall good society takes roots in solid parenting. It still exists, but the media tends to avoid stories like this as they "don't sell."
See that's how you raise a kid.....
Lovely people💕it’s not often we see decent people like this🙏🏼the boy for being amazing for returning the purse and the people for wanting to reward him, bless them all🌸💕
already 15k towards the kid 🤝
Fair play young lad
He looked at the ID and said yes I need to visit
El cuh es bueno
He wanted to smash some cheecks
I love this!
He saw that ID n said let me slide in shawty’s home.
Just gos to show never judge a book by his cover. Everybody probably would though sum else cuz hes young and dresses nice
When he was asked why he went out of his way to return the purse. The fact that such question needs to be asked is kinda sad
Don’t just say in the comments “We need more people like him.” Integrity is the trait this person learned, you can learn it too.
This sound a little fake🤔
That boys got Tegrity
I’m literally crying 😭😭😭😭
It's not just good parenting, give him some credit. Wishing him more good stuff.
I would definitely have returned it. I wouldn’t want someone to do the same for me. Good for him. What a wonderful young man.
They ask why he did something good… if it had of been the opposite no one would of questioned it.. because it’s almost normal to do the wrong thing in this sick ugly world that doing the right thing gets media attention… wow
plot twist: he wanted to take what there was in the purse but there was nothing
He got over 10K atm. Idk the exact amount but last time I seen it, it had at least triple what it has on the video.
Aka he stole it and then returned it with no money in it
God will give you more for each good deed 🤗🤗
Thank you for reporting this it’s nice to have some good news once in a while
👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿
Humanity still alive ❣️
So they we so shocked he did what is the obviously right thing to do they set a fund raiser. If I'm not mistaken isn’t a purse which has valuable information and belongings of someone that which can be easily identified and located with said information one of those things you should be very obviously return? How far have we fallen.
Imagine people doing the right thing and it makes headlines. is it so rare in USA?
My boy was tryna smash forsurely🤣
I once returned 50 bucks I found in an envelope. Got nothing in return. But learnt a valuable lesson
Feels like this is going to be a trend too..
He saw that Id and wanted to clap 😂
🅿️
Fine gentlemen
They wanna hit 🎯
“Do the right thing even when nobody is watching” is the definition of INTEGRITY !!! Well done my boy 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
You earned my respect young man …
Good young man👍
Great job kiddo
Sweet baby💕 God bless him 🙏🏾
Lol only latina's do this, you won't see a black dude doing that or a black woman.... Haha.  These two Latina women should've banged that kid hahaha
The GoFundMe is still actively getting donations. It's up to $15,270 with the highest donation being $2,250.
I know his mama is proud 👏🏿
“A TEEN DID A GOOD THING???”
He knows he stole it and just decided to return it
A 3 some was better den 3k
He was raised by a great mom and he took her advice.  Good job Adrian!!  The world needs good news right now.
What a top top man . Mum must be so proud 👍 winning at parenting
I need to go find a purse
I want one
We need more people like this young man.
Didn’t they raise 10k?
Hé was tryna smash
I did the same thing and it felt super good
I had my watt of cash return to me.  I was walking away and someone flagged me down I didn't know what was going on until I saw my money in his hand. 😎He didn't want a reward  either. I told him we need more people like you. It was more then $1000.00
He did a very good thing to bring the purse to the owner
That's, really sweet! What, a nice, young man.
This gives me some hope for future. This kid deserves whatever he gets. Awesome just awesome.
Love seeing it. More young people should be as honest as he is . Mum sure did raise you right 🤗. This was a very kind and genuine deed.
I like that young man. Honest & helpful
17-Year-Old -Gets a $3k Reward Inside Out - Talks about it and gets about $30k
Dat boy saw her ID n was like damn I might bag a Milf if i take dis purse back😂😂
Jesus wtf is wrong whit Eliana?
That is a good kid
Well done young man!
I mean, DAMN! They hot AF.
"Envy the country that has heroes, huh? I say pity the country that needs them."
Big ups to Adrian, AND his parents.
Good job.
I hope he got to splash one of those beautiful mamacitas lol
"there is hope for our younger gerneration" 💀
His mama raised him right. Wonderful
We need more news feeds like this of humanity at its best.
A fine man
Asking him why he did it? Isnt that just the norm? We should be asking why when people do the opposite
Absolute champ
I’ve done something like this
A more detailed report revealed a missing Peppermint Tic-Tac from the purse.
I’m dead they had to include lived with her but hadn’t updated Sense she moved out😭😭😭🤣
It is up over $15,000 as of this morning.
Bro wanted to smack let’s be real
Better then what Nelly the rapper paid the girl at bowling alley after returning his 300k.he gave her only $100🤦
Good young man. He will be a good role model for his family
is it me or every thinking that the man returned the bag because the girl was absolute chick
great parenting
If she wasn’t hott, he fosho wouldn’t have done that 😂😂
Somebody is always watching, I live my life by that
that kid gonna be successful man someday because he is honest young man
Imagine if the person who lost the purse was a trigger happy person that dude would have been dead
Good for him he should be very proud of himself for doing that let's all treat each other like this
Bro definitely took that purse and just returned it
❤️❤️❤️
It was a generous act.  I'm sure he would of done it for anybody.  But the ID photo was an added bonus 🤣  💯
Great story, especially in todays world, of not having his morals....Im so happy for him that people donated to his good deed....WELL DONE, YOUNG MAN!!!   WELL DONE👏👏👏👏❤❤❤❤👏👏👏👏
Human Kindness does Exist!
King.
The guy is not poor and he is bad boy from streets he don't use drugs and smok or drink alcohol and he don't do gambling that's the reason why he returns back everything.
Good job young man! The world needs more people like you
a abundance of good Karma
Wow, really cool
... and specially when "you think"no one is watching !! If I may add Hats off young man
gg but does anyone know his @
bro saw a baddie on the license and was like ayyyyyyyyyyyyy
That man got money he don't want no purse.    NOW IF HE WAS BROKE   his girlfriend would have a new 👜👛😂
Good kid ❤❤ Good Parent/s❤❤💯💯💯♾
If he was black you wouldn’t see that purse again
dont care
Such a great example of what good parenting can do. What a lovely young man!!
So racist. Just because he is mixed race why do they assume he should be a thief?
Please do more stories like this on black and brown men thanks
A little kindness and humanity is all we need
Not all hero wear capes
I also appreciate the appreciation ❣️
Now thats a good fella
You'll never see this sort of goodness on MSM news. People like good news too. All MSM shows is gloom and doom.
Usually it's the family treatment effect.
i love him and his mum
I want to thank your Mother and family for their hard work of parenting you to be an upstanding young man.
Good parents breed good children. Let's go moms and dads.
Good man his mom raised a good son ;)
The kid's going places!
So nice that they started a “gofoundme” for him
1:50 you need to check neck eg thyroid, i just saved your life
Such a great story. Kudos to that young man.
When you think no one is watching there is someone watching that someone is  God
This is a massive waste of GoFundMe, they could be using it to help people in need but no they want to give someone thousands of dollars because of a stupid ass purse
I hope that people who get botox know that it looks like theyve gotten it..you dont look normal
When he hits 18 he’s valid to smash them hoes
The type of guy you want as your bestie or your boyfriend.
Humanity alive ❤️
Well done young man. Never change.
I knew before I heard in the video the reason was his parent/parents were good. How proud that momma must be right now. She is raising an awesome young man. I just wish kids didn't feel the need to look like a thug. But that is definitely secondary to his character which is A+.
Definitely no hope for the future generations even with this
If anyone wants to leave their purse for me to find and return to you, I could use $3000 right now lol!
Easy money 💰 huh But no,the deed was good
GOD Bless him.
Next IE Episode: A man gives a women her 1$ she dropped on the floor.
The fact that u have to present this on the news is actually sad
This is a good example of why you should do good things lol, jk, don’t do stuff based on the reward, do it because it’s the right thing to do
Respect To This Young Lad..  Hes the kind of ppl we need for peace
Bring a purse back in germany and get beaten up, get no respect, MAYBE 5€ for being "nice" and arrested because you drove to someone like a creep
Nice video
Goddamn her friend has terrible injection 💀
I once found a wallet when I was 7 Years old whilst on A School trip. Gave it to the teacher who returned it to its owner who was a nice lady. I was told by my teachers they would buy me lunch for a week due to my good deed. The teacher got me a 1 flavoured Milk on Monday and I received absolutely 0 lunches.
More news like this please 👍🏽💯
Amazing
Plot twist: after the ladies saw how much the gofund me had raised, they decided to keep it for themselves. 😬 I kid I kid. Great story all around.
Wait what? So returning personal stuff to its owner is not normal? 😳
IM WHEEZING
No ones watching... ❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️
If I got $3k I wouldn’t want the whole neighborhood to know about it. News media can sometimes put ppl in danger
It’s what every normal person should do.   We live in a time this becomes international news lol  wild.
He saw the id and was lookin for more than just returning the purse haha
Good heart.. lucky parents of adrian..
Lmaaao homie saw the drivers license pic and he wanted to meet his future wife 🤣
Good on him
This is awesome 👏    Much respect to this young man ,
Faith in humanity restored
That's bootleg ji
It's a sad world when one young man raised with common decency is the exception, and not the general expatiation. I am happy he did the right thing. And sad that this is news worthy, as I feel this behavior should be a normal everyday thing.
Plot twist:  he stole it but realized it’s a expensive ass purse and the owner is probably rich so if he returns it he can get a big reward 😂
Should've paid some pleasure too ☺️❤️
W young man he def getting some of that mama
The guy was blessed with a great mother.who brought him up the right way.
bet he was happy to see that ring doorbell
Hope he a good life he has good morals and a good mother
This behavior should be normal.
Doing the right thing when nobody is looking sounds like it would be the ethos of Captain America! You should be proud and your mother raised a good man! 👌🏻
What’s really sad, is that this is news, and not the regular behavior that everyone should have.. America has lost its values as it was before..
A rare find right there..... Thank you young man....
My faith in humanity has been restored 🥺🥺🥺
Exactly what my mum told me too.. ly Ma
People always say, “We need more people like this.” Rather than think, we CAN be people like this young man. It’s starts with you.
Fake story. An elaborate plot to raise some cash for fuel.
Awesome kindness
Parents must be awesome to raise such a great young man!
Melina is my name.....
Well done, young man‼️💕
God bless his good soul....
😂😭what’s up with news
May God bless you Adrian Rodriguez  and always keep you well.
what a nice man
love ❤
He jus wanted tha milf lmao
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
reap as you sow 101
This happens in Japan all the time!
it is so nice
There was nothing in that purse..
bro saw her license photo and said hold up…
A white woman meets a black man. She says take me back home and show me what you black men do. So he took her home tied her to the bed robbed the TV and ran away
I thought he was Marcel Ruiz, you can see the resemblance. So good.
I thought he was Marcel Ruiz, you can see the resemblance. So good.
he said “new year new vato man”🤣
I returned a lost purse but I only got some chocolates lol
Very nice video!
Its rare to find honest people these days..atleat this video proofs that there is still humanity left in this world
"Always do the right thing even when nobody is watching." That's a maxim of life too few people act on.
am i the only one who thought it was Faze rug
What a GREAT guy!! Absolutely WONDERFUL! Always do the right thing, the honest thing, & it will come back around for u too...maybe not a reward each time, but the universe will always have your back, if u just keep putting one foot in front of the other & do the right thing!!
Let’s be honest, he saw the fine mature ladies on the license and THATS why he handed it in LMAO
😎
he so fine
why does he look like someone who'd have stolen the purse in the first place. hat on backwards, gangsta bling, baggy pants falling down, i probably wouldn't have even opened the door with him reaching in his pocket like that. "don't judge a book by its cover" yeah sure, but why else does one dress like a street thug?
he’s fine asf
can we see a reaction video of him getting the reward 😭😭😭
He is FINNNNEEE!!!!
Do same from his lesson !!!
What a sweet kid, he'll go far in life
I am 100% Gay Just to let everybody know I live in Texas my name is Alex Roberts just to let you know everybody I love you sexy man
That’s a handsome Mexican man I love black men too
What an awesome kid
he wants to meet the hot chicks
Good kid , I was the same at 17, great years of my life, and ohh my god the girls... Lol 🤣😆 hahaha.... Fun years. Loved it.
I Swear I hate Reading the comments, but get suckered into it, after the good ones... then come the, over the top extras!... "How nice even though he's dressed like a thug"...🙄🙄 What he looks like is a Kid, dressed as most kids dress. T-shirt, Jeans, ball cap. I guess the jewelry puts him in Kingpin status!! LOL The Judgement is Real!!! Great Job Adrian "ARod" Rodriguez.  Your mom is right... Do the right thing even when know one is looking.  It will come back to you.
adrian fine asf .
There is hope and there isn’t hope
The go fund me is at 15k now, really shows the little things matter
i need his instagram
💯💯✅ always do good deeds
Sooo AWESOME!! 💖 GOOD JOB KIDDO!! I Cannot WAIT TO SHOW THIS VIDEO TO MY KIDS & NIECES & NEPHEWS!!! GOD BLESS AMAZING PEOPLE!! 😘 😘 😘 😘
okay he fine
It’s not that deep tho people should do it and not have to be rewarded
Mama raised him right 👍
Wow , the algorithm actually puts out a good story.
Thats really nice of the lady’s raising money to reward the teen , well deserved ❤️
Nice 💪🏽
he fine
Its good sam
karma
👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
What an amazing kid! Good job babe! 🖤🙏💯
What so chaos about this its Normal in my place they even return back cash
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🔥🔥🔥🇺🇸
I've seen this happen and I have returned lost items myself. It was awesome to see him receive that massive reward for being a good person.
I love him
He was tryna get sum lol
Things like this also gets featured much on the news in my country, because it rarely happens unlike in places like Japan.
Now this, this is a good story! 🙏💕
Very funny. Lol those ppl like showing off like that I know Mexicans so well. Lol. They ll help some ladies when a lot ppl around but they ll rob her when she alone lol. Trust me they r like that
Just for giving a purse back, Jesus Christ suck an over reaction 😂 give the guy a little pocket change andnrrlax
Normalize this
he was raised in a sincere and kind way
Kudos to himm
We all should learn to do the same 👍
God bless this kid 👍🏽
Good lad.
Pov: he stole it and than gave it back cuz he wanted the money so he gave it back and became famous for returning a lost purse as a hero
bro has drip
Wow what nice guy
I believe in good karma.. People always ask why I tip so well or why I give the homeless money if I have it on me. The answer is , I know what it's like to be homeless and my mother raised both my brother and I off of tips. Above all else, it just feels good. Not to mention, I feel the good come back to me in other ways whenever I do the right thing. So.. Always do the right thing.
Whooohoooooo I love stories like this!!!!!
That should be basics, normality.  Not something 😲 to surprise.
Hopefully he can pull his pants up after getting that award.
To ladies out there ..Who's having a crush on him? Say hyyyyyeeee
he seen the id photo and was tryna get that
He is amazing. He will become and transform into A *GREAT MAN* wow I wish I was a you g teen again I’d love for him to be my boyfriend lol 😝
Your lucky it was him that was an easy come up for someone personally I would of brought it back too but most people especially a 17 year old kid wouldn’t have
Love this!
*good gangsta !*
More morals than Boris Johnson, Prime Minister of UK
Now if some adults can learn from this teenager but I won't hold my breath !!
What’s her @? 💀
that’s some great stuff
Imagine he stole it and wanted to return it 😂😂
As I’ve always said. Proper parenting yields great kids. My neighbors use to always say how lucky we were to have such good kids. Luck had nothing to do with it.
He got that good ol karma
The hood foomaritan
he fine
Nice
Props to him leading by example. 💯
👏👏
I love see good people do good things for people 😇
But did he get the 3k because a lot ppl make a go fund me and end up keeping it instead if giving it to the person lol
Orale. That's why I love mi gente.  Big hearts.
These good deeds should be normal
I’m not gone lie Ik for a fact he went through the purse for money and when it wasn’t no cash he was just like man let me do the right thing 🤣🤣I BET YOU

Wow! This is a wonderful story♡
What a pure heart

Imagine he stole it and his conscience made him bring it back💀💀
And to think we can’t raise money for the homeless.
Good guy, the world needs more people like him.
That gofund me is at 15k now. crazy
1:17 “the women had a surprise for him” MY DIRTY MIND: they definitely had a Wholesome threesome

Moral of the comment : Raise your child with a moral values.
GoFundMe Reward is up to 15k now as of 7/6/22 thanks to the video going viral. O_O
yay!!!!!
And he cute😍😍
maybe nothing is there in purse
there was probably nothing in the purse worth anything
reminds me of when a customer forgot their umbrella at my workplace, so we kept it for them and when they came asking for it we returned it. and i overheard her saying to her friend "you know its a good store when they rrturn your umbrella"
If the three grand were in there we wouldnt have this video
Amazing I’ll hv to show my son this video as parents we always want to show our kids to do the right thing.
“Fine young man” 😂
He needs to apply for a job at the FBI.
Dhar man plot
🙄
This brought tears to my eyes. God bless him.
So nice to hear ! What a nice young man ! There is hope thank you!
The fact that this is such a big thing for someone to do in this society is actually kinda sad. Should be the norm
🥰
Meanwhile, ppl judge my personality by my hoodie
In Japan it’s normal to return things  to ppl who had them without any rewords🤣
Amen! Godly leadership that everyone should follow! 🌟✨
“There’s hope for our generation” say the ones that raised this generation haha
What a good young man!
Integrity- Doing what’s right even when no one’s looking
That is the dumbest stuff ive ever heard, but congrats
Integrity first.  I like it.
THAT'S MY HOMIE!!!!
🥰🥰🥰♥️♥️nice
Kid is gonna do great things. Good job parents!
Great job  God will be good yo you.
The key thing here is do nice things even when no on is watching. Now days everyone records their 'nice' deed and puts it online for attention.
It wasn't no money in there only credit cards
HES THE ONE WHO STOLE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE!
God bless Adrian. A shining human being. ✨🌟⭐💫💖
Plot twist he scoping out the house waiting for the lick 😈
pov: gta 5
Man if I seen her face I’ll wanna see her in person don’t even lie you would too lol
Mexicans trying to pull publicity stunts hahahahaa
FAKE!
💓💓💓💓
Sure he did 🤣
What a good kid
Plot twist Adrian stole it all this time and decided to return it. 🤣🤣🤣✌🏻
That chick who lost her purse is fine af. She should come find me lol 😆
Aww, such a sweet kid! I love nice stories like this.
We know one of the reasons he did it 🤣
Shshbsbuxxu sjsjdbd

Damn knowing my luck i would’ve gotten reported for stealing the bag
This seems like something saul goodman would orchestrate to try to paint a client in a favorable light
He's getting soooo much 😼😼😼
Hope we have more people like him..😘😘😘
I love it.  Great kid, God bless him.
❤
I tell my son the same things about doing the right thing but he says he would take whatever is in the wallet/purse and just leave it there. I clearly failed. 😭
Good job kid!!! Keep doing what’s right!! You will be rewarded!!!
Everyone strive to be like him
I love how inside edition made at least $10k off this video lol I wonder how much they paid the lady for the footage
Plot twist, he stole the purse
That’s a king in my book
He was trying to smash the bird. U dig
California Discovers Congeniality
He only did that cause he thought she was bad and might give him a chance
Wooow we need more people like him in this world
He saw that ID picture and said he gotta try his luck with that baddie
Wtf is wrong with this world.....  10m views and Only 350k likes?? Do we want more people like this in the world? Show you're appreciation for people like this!!
That’s my homie right there
Honestly I'd do that with anything I found that wasn't mind and was able to return it to the owner  Though I wouldn't get anything out of it like this guy, it'd be a thank you so much and then go on with our lives because that's how it usually goes in this type of  situations or someone steals whatever it is
IRS: *it's free real estate*
He was hoping to get a little smoochy from the lady who’s ID HE SAW. Was like damn she fine!
*This young man is awesome his mom should be proud* a real prince among men 😁
Man this kid need to work for me... i will pay good for that kind of character.
What an awesome young man!
Big deal, like this is breaking news.
That is awesome. More people need to be like him. Do to others that you would want to be done to you.
Good man!
Only in cali
This young man will go far in life. He’s headed for greatness. Give him and his mother credit, she raised a good man. We need more of this kindness in this tattered world . Good job mom and son.
Integrity!
finally a good arod
it’s up to $15,000 now ❤
That's a real man right there, props my dude.
It's a set up.   Never touch anything that don't belong to you
That’s nice
When I gave a lady back a roll of cash she dropped in the mall . she was rotten I’d never do that again! Finders, keeper’s !
This California teen is a fantastic individual and he did the right thing. I love stories like this one. I wish more teenagers were like this wonderful young man. The universe will always reward him for his good deeds and God loves him dearly. 🙂😇💛💛💛🧡🧡🧡💚💚💚💙💙💙🙂😇
I needed this today, there is good in this world, God bless him.
Absolutely wonderful. All people involved.
They should have added the go fund me in the description
❤️❤️❤️
This had happened to me once, a guy at my age called me and said "hey dude, you kinda lost your credit card, ID and all that" (It had my phone number attached to it, if this woulda ever happened, so, we meet up and the guy gave me my things and I just gave the dude like 100 bucks and bought him a few beers for him being kind, he's today one of my good gaming mates and we meet once awhile just to hang out :D
Let this be known that stealing the purse or wallet with 100 dollars could've been so much more if you just did the right thing.
That MF stole the purse LMFAO
Awesome boy That’s wonderful always do the right thing even though no one is watching. Because God is always watching and God is our creator and we will all see him in the end.
I bet if the purse had $3000 in it when he found it he would’ve never returned it.
If I owned a company I would be trying to hire this young man in some kind of leadership role.
God Bless Him
This was very inspiring. Doing what's right when no-one is looking. It brings a small sense of balance in an uncertain time.
Thank god the cops didn’t KILL him!!!!!!!
kind of helps you appreciate humanity...wonderful thing to do.
why he so fine tho
Hell yeah Adrian!! He's drippy and gracious!!!
the fact that good behavior is this rare that it’s on the news is really sad
It's good to see a heartwarming story for a change!
Bro just got 3k off that too 😂😂👍👍
What’s his insta
He seems like a chill dude Fr I fw that
i would done the same tbh
they’re so fine
Aww hos parents raised him right

That teen didn't need the money lmao check his whole outfit
Good karma coming his way
Da hood hood like da gangster
adrian look guuuuud
Love this act of kindness!
Yeah after he went through it and realized wasn't any money in the purse lol
We need more stories like this on the news instead of bad.
That’s not a kid. That’s a MAN
Wow! The kid is a real one fosho
I finally have a little bit of faith im humanity. Good man!
Righhht on
Homie pulled out the license and went to go shoot his shot with that milf
It's so nice to see good hearted people doing good deeds. There's a lot of bad stuff in the news, but I live for videos like this.
Thought that was Tony loya for a minute 😂
I did this once, and was invited in for coffee.
Wow that dude was so cool and wicked of him giving the lady her purse 👛 that he found inthe mall
Honestly, if I saw her on the ID I’d go too lol she’s hot. Let’s not pretend.
That's right home boy you will get super far in life super good carma to you
I think she would pounce on that young man
ther is no hope
Wow glad to see there is still hope left In the world
he seen the ID in the purse of the sexy ass female & pulled up lol smart kid
That’s a human right there.
🌬❤️‍🩹🌬
Good job young man. It's one thing to be raised good, but it's another thing to act on it. You should be proud of yourself.
Wut goes around comes around 🤷🏿‍♂️
Thats right homie 💯👊👊👊
💛🙏🏼
Gaw dam he was fine
He saw the name and was tryna hit
We need more teens like this in our current society
For those wandering the go fund me is at $15,075 as of now
I love it
very good action
I'd like to buy him a beer when he turns 21.
plot twist there was nothing good in the bag
fye
That kid is cool.
Nice ;)
👍
He was raised well
So nice
THIS FOOOOO
Good stuff
He better than me😭
Respect young sir.
Great to see some positivity in today’s youth, good job to the mom who instilled honesty and doing the right thing.
The knowledge of right and wrong begins in the home.  This young man will go on hopefully continue to make positive changes in the world we live in.  May he continue to pass on the wonderfully morals his mom taught him to his own future kids.
I wouldn’t gotten me some free things before I returned that👀
Amazing young man..your mum has brought you up well. You deserve all the good karma that has come to you by being so honest..bless you and your family 🤣
I love this.I turned in a man's wallet at the movie theater,and returned a lady's purse that was left at my yard sale.Someone should put him through college.I would if I could.
Dat is wussup but kudos to mamas parental guidance
I did the Same haha, I moved to a new place near nyc and found a purse with about 7k in there, all credit cards , ids and stuff. It was around Christmas. Gave it back and the lady gave me 500$ back haha. I’d do it over and over again.
What an awesome kid who did the right and kind thing! I’m glad he got money from admirers. 👍🏻
Aww what an awesome kid 🙂
Mama tried?? Mama DID!!Brought that young man up right! Very heart warming story!! Need more of that!!
Made me happy made me smile 😁😊
Good boy 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻💫
Rodriguez is my last name!
After he “found it”
Good for him !!

How to get $3000: Step one: track down these families. Step two: steal family members purse. Step four: return family members purse: Step five: claim $3000 reward
He prolly saw her license and saw she was a baddy and returned it lol 😂
That's a good young man right there.  Maybe there is hope for today's youth.  Much respect young man!
🥹🥹🥹🥹 more of this please!
😭
I claim this energy
FYI as of July 6th its at $15,075 GOOD FOR HIM. If I returned the purse I'd feel SOOO good to just be able to help someone like that. Its makes your heart jump in cases like that. I am willing to bet it made him quite happy to be able to help someone else out. But to get such a reward from the public, just wow!
he seen that she was bad and had to go see for himself 💀
I'm surprised they think this is news worthy haha. It's good and all, but I've found a couple wallets on the street or side of the road and return them without even a second thought. I'm sure a lot of others have as well. It's nothing that special being a good human. Being good should be default, sadly that seems it's not the case anymore.
Instead of feeling nearly pleased for watching this type of new, I feel very discouraged that this kind of action became a new or something that needed to be rewarded with a gofundme or any kind of stuff. Is people that bad that finding someone with good values instantly become something viral?
K A R M A
Sadly if you showed that picture of him with his backwards hat on and gold chains first thing some people would say is he's a gangbanger & thug
Aww, I love him!!!
Good boy
See dat! Hey cops……DON’T KILL HIM!
It is very common in India's state of Kerala.. even I have done this.. and no rewards I received 😀
Very good
What a sweet young man!
bro rly took the risk in gta and it payed off lmao
South Bay San Diego in tha 🏠
Sad to to think that they think this is rare in our community. As a father I’m worried what people would think about my son.
One more reason why u shouldn't give back a purse
Build the damn wall already. We need to keep these people out.
Lord bless him 💯💯💯
Hmm...I wonder if he would return a man's wallet
What blows me away is he could have turned it into the store but he went all the way to her house!! Now that's an awesome kid, well done young man and huge credit to his mama ❤️
hell yeah dude :)
protect him at all cost
Wow. Nice
Wow
good on this foo
Blessings
Based kid
🙏🙏🙏
She kinda milfy too tho
It is sad that Eliana Martin was fined for not updating her license after the county clerks office viewed this story.
He just saw the ID and wanted sum😂🤦🏽‍♂️
I’m really happy that this young man did the right thing, but it really disappoints me that the headline of “17-year-old returns woman’s lost purse” generates 10M views. Isn’t that just common courtesy?
They took most of that raised money for themselves.
These GTAV return rewards must have been buffed.
Plot twist, he got robbed for the 3k and is hoping it will be returned!
Pshh he was just trying to get it in with the pretty lady on that license. 😂 kidding of course this is awesome
Good boy
"There's hope for our younger generation " people from your generation would smoke crack then go dance on cardboard
If a woman found the purse and returns the purse she wouldn't be rewarded   stereotypical
If he were in Japan,he would be just an ordinary guy.
Why is it now a miracle to return something u found
He look JI
Men good job 👍
That restores my faith in humanity more today than yesterday
A fine young man, in more ways than one 🥰🥰
my father always told me to stole the things from others, but i never will, the right is what this guy made, i made the same and i felt absurdly well, when i had the chance to return the goods from others, i had to give it in secret and i never said anything to my father. for me no matter if i will get something in return someday, i think that is right give the things back to the owner if we find it, even more if the things has high value.
"Always do the right thing; even when nobody is watching." Me: *just got out of basic training* 👁👄👁 "this is the way"
Bro prolly saw the ID and was like damnnnn 😂
Something like this happened to my brother. He found this purse and the woman’s wedding ring was in it and some cash. We tracked her down. This was back in the day day when everyone had house phones and you looked for them in the yellow pages lol. She didn’t give him $3k but she did give him like $800. Kindness goes a long way.
I’m so proud of this young man !! We still have plenty of hope in America 👍
Don’t judge a book by its cover. Great move the homie did
For them to even think to pay back the kind favor speaks high volumes of them too!!
What if he was black and returned the purse would he still get a gofund me raise for him by a hispanic family.......NO
This story restores my faith seriously
What a honest person. This shows that we gotta be always honest and good no matter if there rewards or not. We always need to have respect for everyone else's stuff no matter what.
Respect 🫡
And then we have grown adults who would use the cc and cash and not even return an ID.  Such great morale!
He thought about it but want nothing in it
So sweet
S T A G E D !!!!  F A K E
🙏🏻
imagine staging a video of your nephew bringing you your purse, and it gets on the news
He’s cute 🥰
Kimg
I would’ve turned it in to the store. He went the extra mile and deliver it to her and made sure she got it. Good man.
We need this.....more than ever.....WE NEED THIS!
Probably took a picture of all the credit cards just in case  You never know !
I love how they make the headline “fine young man raised by parents right” when that’s how kids should be raised anyways
Wow so kind person
I love stories like this ❤️
This is the 17 year olds men we need not these shooters
Awesome young man.
He saw the license photo and knew how much more the cheeks would be worth.
No matter the appearance we all can do this
I wonder if he were black would this still be national news
It's the money you earn from the side quest
I've returned a lost purse and an ATM card someone left at a machine. Even turned in some nice Raybans to the lost and found. Sure could use 3000 bucks right now... 😂
Very good kid, and equal props to the mother for raising him right as too many parents these days aren't parenting. Shout out to the two ladies who set this up, rewarded the kid and got the message out there. However I must say, it shows how far we've fallen as a society that something like this would be so out of the norm that it has created this reaction. I've returned many lost items throughout the years and the message the kid told is the motto I and all of us must live by. If anyone lost something, wouldn't they want the finder to return it? So why not do as you would want someone to do for you.
Angel Rodriguez I wish you the best in life, continue to be yourself because you make the world a better place. We need more people like you 💯👍
This video hopefully brings out a change and alertness for not only young generations but all 🤞😊
Parents have nothing to do with how someone will act when they grow up 😂
Hero Origin Story
That's Bull....  I thought the owner of the purse gave him 3k
Dude's gofundme is at 15k
Good for him 👌
Good for him.
She said did he take my only $20 I had in there .... lol he looked at that i.d pik ND said I rather smash than pocket $20 ND give my mom this ugly avocado influenced purse .. smart young man.
Funny thing how much attention you get from being a decent human being. Cool how it blew up lol
Good young man right there
Good young man well done 👍🏼
Plot twist: he stole it
She bad asf boi I would too
Good boy
I hope those two cougars gave em a SPECIAL REWARD!
"There's hope in the younger generation"..... Pfffft AHAHAHA HAHAHA!! SYKE!!... He's the ONLY one that's good! Everyone else is sooo bad!!
So is that $3k reward the money he raised online while trying to find this boy because she forgotten to ask his name and more info?
Can we get more stories like this?? Thank you
we started wrongly by saying there is hope… yeah nah there is not
Amen 🙏🏽 great young man
ofcourse  doing the right thing feels good but gas a little expensive however if I saw ELIANA MARTIN s photo i would also opt to head to her place
The parents did a GOOD job raising this kid!!
What's the GoFundMe?
This dude is cute gimme his socials
He saw her id and said DAMN! I gotta see her in person 😂😂😅 he was tryna get lucky
That young man is the textbook definition of integrity
Bro Prolly Got Some Buns From 2 Thick Latinas
Whoever raised him did an excellent job
First thing she said there's hope for younger generation such a lame thing to say there's always hope it's just a negative people like you
W
I did the same thing twice .First time I found an ID ,debit card and a school ID found the girl on IG and I told her .Second time I found a wallet and I gave it to the police .What’s funny is that I lost my wallet and someone gave it to the cops and LAPD gave it back to me ..I guess that’s karma .
I’m guessing he came with that grey Audi behind, maybe would of been a different story if he pulled up with a bike instead 😁 but still great act of humanity from my man 🙏🏼
I bet some people would judge him negatively based on appearance. But he's very decent.
"Theres hope for our Younger Generation"   yea, no there isn`t
Forget the money, I'd ask for a date with one or both of those ladies.
He fine asf.
Goes to show GOOD humanity still exists 👏👏👏💯💯💯
Definitely got some cougar buns out the deal too
Good parenting, good head on his shoulders, good idea and hopes of what the future needs to have in store. God bless this kid and his family, this is exactly what we need more of in this world
my mans just hit 15k USD on gofundme. gau damn
Melina what a woman
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Still no hope
Now, most of us might run into something like this, except we might get no reward or even scorn for doing something nice. That doesn’t matter. Even if you get punished or nothing gained, you still do the right thing.
Look at him, sagging his pants and hat backwards. It can be anybody❤️ this kid is most likely from one of these hoods and didn’t even think about taking that purse and the stuff inside. Never judge a book by its cover💯
He prolly stole it and gave it back
In other news Eliana is given a summons for not updating her address within 10 days.
I love this. Imagine how much better the world would be if everyone did what he did.
I know exactly why he returned that purse. I would too...😉
God more of this please.
His GoFundMe is up to 25k dollars
Wheres the link to gofundme?
That’s so cool seems like a great kid
Stay the course youngblood
Anything for a news story how embarrassing
C'est ça qu'on veut ^^
Now 10+ Million people know how much of a BAMF Adrian Rodriguez is :)
He looks like comethazine low-key
I may be in need of funds but I wouldn’t accept a reward
“Ahh man there’s no percs in this purse, might as well return it”
Steals purse Gets less than $3k Returns purse for reward Profit
We need more people like this
He seen that pic on the ID and shot his shot. Lol
Good kid.
Humanity wins
Atta boy...your mom taught you right brotha.. God bless you and God bless her.....👍
Yes good gets good 👍🏽
He’s a good person but lemme catch my son returning a purse full of money
This happened to me before. It was actually my 18th birthday and I'd gone to the mall with my family. I ended up leaving my wallet in the bathroom stall and didn't realize it. I didn't even know I'd left my wallet until I got home hours later. I called the mall and told them I'd left it in the bathroom. They took my number and a description of the wallet and told me they'd reach out if anyone found it. I honestly had no hope in getting it back at all so I freaked out and cried the rest of the day for my birthday. The next day I got a call back from some old lady who said she'd found my wallet and wanted to return it to me. It ended up being that all my money, cards and social were still in there untouched. The old lady made me meet her in public to see my face to make sure it was really mine. I'll always be thankful to that woman I'm sure by now she's probably dead but she really saved me from having my identity stolen and worse.
“Fine young man” I know das right 😂😂😂😂😂
I find it sad when someone does the right thing and the majority of people have a shocked response. This is not only the right thing to do but the only thing you should do in this situation.
I would have done the SAME THING AND I AM A BLACK MALE!!! I am no criminal either!
W man
4 years ago I found a purse took it to police station. Didn't know was full of jewelery. The owner didn't give me 3k. Gave me 20$. Wouldn't return it if was now.
"there's hope for our younger generation" made me laugh
Awesome to see that we still have good people among us 👍
I've returned lost wallets to homes. Got no reward, minus a thank you from a couple who knew the one guy who lost his wallet while walking home. It's okay though. I just wanted to do a good deed, and hoped that if I had lost something valuable that someone would return it to me if they found it.
Hes fine
Good heart and he fine. 🤞🏽😩❤
Nice
He cute
He kinda cute
What a good Cuh
Good parenting morales! God bless this young man
He cute ASF
The fact that these things can go viral and get known so fast is actually saddening. It shouldn't be shocking that people do good things. People should obviously still be grateful, but the fact that there's so much of a reaction by people not involved shows the sad state the world is in.
Good for him, I can tell that he was raised right and had good parents
95% California residents. If they found something. They ain't going to return it 💯%, fact. But that young man right there. Did the right thing 👍. He deserves that reward 👏.
Yes Sir!
Thank Heavens RING was watching!
Good lad
It’s kinda sad that their default POV towards teens is “hopelessness” tho. :’’’)
What country is this?
The go fund me is actually at 15 thousand now
How absolutely delightful. That guy is a beacon to all people.
Wait………. My friends name is Adrian he is 17 and he found a purse like that I think I know him
17 yr old driving alone?
Awesome guy, love him
I hope that milf gave him more than money 🤣
That's a good person 🙂
Nah he saw that ladies ID and wanted them digits next
Warms the heart. Good man 🙏🏽
Further proof that everyone should just be a good human.  God Bless 💙
Aww God bless him
What a wonderful story, young man raised right we love to see it!
„There‘s Hope for our younger Generation“. But is there Hope for our older Generation, which ruined nearly everything for this younger Generation?
How'd she get in the house or her car? Keys were not in the purse? Fake news lol.
Kudos to the young man and his parents who obviously raised him right. We could resolve so many societal problems with more people like this
HELL YEA FROM SAN DIEGO THATS HOW WE DO IT 🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
🐐
Me and a buddy once found a wallet full of cash in a Taco Bell parking lot, but we didn't take anything and instead used the ID inside to find them. It was literally 2AM, he was sleeping, and the guy didn't even know he had lost it.
He just wanted to have sex with the woman.  Smart play.
Great young man
He better than me I wouldn’t took a piece of gum out then give it back
He must go back. This is trump country MAGA!!!!!! 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
"The driver’s license inside belonged to her friend, Eliana Martin, who used to live with her, but hadn’t updated her address." Uh huh...  Time to call ICE.
Faith in human honesty and kindness is so good, wish this guy all the best
y’all in these comments acting like he saved someone from dying ☠️
This is an awesome young man! Thank You for being such an honest & truly good guy Adrian!!
I bet he thought the woman was a hottie and hoped  for a different kind of reward !!!!!!!       hehe ;)
He’s so handsome ❤️
Great kid
Plot twist: he took everything inside the bag and replaced it with fake items
Handsome
It all starts with parenting, and this 17 year old is an product of great parenting!
He returned something to one of his own. He’s evolutionarily sane.
For once no one judged him at first sight. Their may be hope yet!
Is that a snake on the sidewalk bruh 💀
Damn she’s hot now we know y he went back to return it 😂🫡
Absolute legend! 👏👏
Yes most teens would have kept it but this kid drives a newer Audi. Obviously he didn’t need the money lol
No there is no hope for our younger generation
It’s still good people out here with good hearts 🙏🏾🙌🏾❤️. May God continue to bless him & his family 🙏🏾❤️.
He’s so fine
The best good news I’ve heard in years
Gofundme almost at 15k
Respect 😉👍
Amazing
Am I the only one thinking about the movie 'Greta' as soon as seeing the green lost purse? xD
This restores my faith in humanity.
Do a normal thing and you will be rewarded
W gentleman
The amount of ppl glossing over this one act of kindness shows how fkd the world is🤦 it seems so foreign and yet should be an every day occurrence, quite sad really.
I reckon he thought he’d get an easy bang out of it.
Unfortunate that doing the expected thing, is now considered going above and beyond. Kudos to him though, most kids probably wouldn't have returned it.
cmon, after he looked at the id and saw the woman he wanted to score and land by her kekw thats why he brought it back
I found a waitresses book lying in the street with a few hundred dollars cash inside. It had the receipt from the restaurant and I was able to give it back to her.   She bawled for a good five minutes. It was a very memorable moment. Treat others the way you want to be treated. Such a simple concept.
God bless him!
Ima lose my purse on purpose cuz he FOINE (im his age btw)
Me in GTA 🦉
Honesty is the only policy 😁
Plot twist: he knew he would get more money by doing the good deed
so glad to read a story like this...makes my day
any one else think he’s fine 😫?
The next day he was caught robbing a bank 😂
Good man
How much he have rn?
This young man gives hope and belief in humanity... blessings
she badd
I applaud him and the way his mom raised this good guy❤️
Yooo that Gofundme is at $15K now lol
What is lost will be found. And ye shall be rewarded.
In Norway 99 % of the time if u loose somthing like that, itll come home to you, its the norm... Very kind people here, and i would never steal anything from anybody. Do to other like you want to be treated yourself, hes not a hero and did not deserve 3k for doing that. a thanks and some small money would be okei.  But if they have enough money to give him 3k, and they felt like doing so, its okei. but never expect to get somthing when you help someone out. do it of the kindness inside you. Im sure thing young boy is rised well, too bad not everybody according to this comment section is this well behaved in Usa, and propably many other countries in south america and other parts of the world too.
Its kinda sad that deeds of common decency now make national news
Foo saw her ID and was tryna smash 😂
Hope in humanity?
Yeahh sorry with all the "iwantlikescringequotes". This, is how People act with normal and  propper morals. And, its quite sad this is seen as something special. No credits lost tho, for the young man.
KARMA in full effect
It's more like $14,940 now 😀👍🏽
It was 3.6k   what a hero!
This is sooo amazing! Good guy!!
Plot twist: there was nothing valuable so I might as well give it back😂.  (JUST A JOKE) He did the right thing returning it.
A nice, respectful and honest Kid. And the lady's family seems like a close one too, "you help one of us, we all reward you". The elements of good converged.
I found a purse in a shopping cart outside of my local very busy supermarket...I looked for an id...the wallet was loaded with unused gift cards, tons of cash..we drove to the address to return it , we arrived at a mansion!!!!! No one was home, we went back another time a few hours later....an obnoxious woman came to the door matching the Id photo,had no clue she was without her purse and grabbed it.. No thank you, no nothing....next time I find a purse with that much cash in it, I'm keeping the cash n throwing the purse in a mailbox.
Aaaww that is so nice. We need more kind teens like him
I found a lady's wallet with a 18k check inside. I took the train all the way to her house to return it.
We NEEDED to see this!!!! Such an awesome young man.
How far have we fallen where it's a sirprize when purse is returned
YOU ONE COOL CAT BRO.. MAD RESPECT.. YOU A REAL MAN BRO.. BETTER THAN MOST
Nah he seen her picture he wanted to hit that. He ain’t sneaky 😹
What would he do with the contents of that purse anyway, the phone can be tracked, and surveillance cameras will capture you anyway if you try and use any of her cards. So I mean unless there was money actually in the purse, why wouldn't you return it, then there is a possibility of a reward. So let's not crown the kid the new Ghandi or anything.
Adrian saw that the women on the driver license was hot and wanted to meet her. Just speculation. ;)
Republicans could learn something from this, haters
the only difference with me is I would have covered up the stupid camera.
that man is a 23 year old now
It starts with good parenting, parents need to be held accountable for their children. Adrian is a result of being brought up well and having good values instilled in him early on by his parent(s). Love to see it.
He's a great kid raised by fantastic parents.
Fake. All for views
He saw how fine she was and thought he could clap sum
What’s the lady’s @
I did that too my I didn’t get any surprise,bring back iphone 13 👊👊👊
Good deeds totally pay off. Spiritually too😊
What a lovely young man
Yo Adrian!!!! I applaud you 👏😊
when my niqqa royalty
where can i pick this sq up im all out n just have some kill quests rn and need to get my cash and stats up
we was just hoping to meet the owner, i would
You love to see it ❤️
The kindness he to into the world came back to him
i bet he went right over to get an ounce of weed lolololololol
Little so they know he got $40 worth of shopping using contactless payment 😂
WOW , that was something ❤️ your mother must be so proud ❤️
God bless the child
He should become a Marine. ❤️
And he’s fine 🙈
I find every year on average two wallets, on the street. It's so ridiculous my friends joke about it. Every single time I take my time to find the person on social media, meet up somewhere and give it back. About 90 percent of the time it's a post box I drop it into, once a guy was picky and unavailable to meet, wanted me to go bring it to his place further away (!!) ... and of course , I get nada, because gratitude is a lost word. And in Belgium if you hand it in to the police, they have to destroy your ID , even of you present yourself to claim it, but people don't realize how much I help them. Oh well... off to find another wallet.
What an awesome dude. So nice to hear a positive story coming out in the media
Always do the right thing. Bless this young man 🙏❤️
Id take the purse lmao
Thanks for sharing this story!
nah he was wanting to get that cougar booty
Man definitely made his parents proud.
Respect
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
What a nice young man he was raised by a good woman ❤️
it's crazy how this is seen as incredible, it should be normal.
You're the hope 🤞🏻 for our new generation Boi! Keep it up
I also did this, twice. First time it was a purse left in a public phone box. Lots of cash within plus driving licence etc. There was also a phone number which I called and arranged a time when I'd call round to return the purse. When I arrived at the house the owner of the purse wasn't home ( although she knew I was coming )instead her flatmate opened the door, thanked me saying owner wasn't home and slammed the door on me. Second time I found a businessman's wallet on the exit of an underground garage. Usual documents and cash inside + phone number. Called the number and explained I had the wallet but owner wasn't available. ( this took several calls ). I left my number for the owner to contact me which he did an hour or so later. Turned up in a Porsche 911, met me, thanked me and gave me his business card and got back into his Porsche and drove off. Perhaps I had been expecting too much but I didn't have the luck for my good deeds the kid in this video had!
His parents should be proud 😅
Its crazy that doing the right thing is so rare.
This gives me faith in humanity. I would have done the same thing because it is the right thing to do.
Sad that that is even a news story these days and isn’t the normal expected behaviour and response.
😃
That's so beautiful. God bless you Adrian and your Mum.
Well let's give him a ticker-tape parade. He did what a normal, decent person does. Big deal. He's a sweet kid. That's about it.
This is GTA V all over again.
Ayyyyeee my fellow brother! That's the way keep doing good brother help change this broken corrupt world good job brother! Thank the lord there is still hope in this world 🙏🙏🙏
:)
God bless you young man ❤️❤️❤️
That woman has had so much plastic surgery she can't move her face anymore. Jesus what a freak.
I once encountered an elderly man at the atm machine. he had just taken out some money. He added that money to the stack he already had and then proceeded to place it in his back pocket so he thought. As he left I picked it up and it was at least 1k plus I quickly turned gave it back to him, long story short 1 year later I lost my wallet at School it had about 750 I had just gotten payed and a girl and her bf found my wallet and returned it to the lost and found and my friend was in charged there and quickly called me and said someone just turned in your wallet with all your money😁 good karma who would have thought🙌🏽
Plot twist the purse was empty anyways
he was trynna smash LOL
Play them cards right Soldier you’ll be in a love triangle by 19
What a world we live in when someone returing a purse is somehow of a local hero ..
His name is Adrian so he’s definitely a good guy
Why can't the mass shooter's kids parents raise them like this
Good, now he can buy a belt with that money.
He's so cute 😍. I hope he's having a good day.
Good job kid
This is a direct result of good parenting. His parents should be proud to have raised such a good, honest young man.
The main character---
If we all lived like this including myself this world wouldn't be recognizable compared to what it currently is
Good job but why is this big news ? Just because he looks like he wouldn’t do an act like that ?
"Teen".... ? this is a MAN. A decent human being. I'd love to shake his hand.
he does look like an adrian
Inside Edition is fake news
I'm literally moved and sad at the same time. I'm moved because of the gesture and honesty of this young man, thinking about how their parents raised him, they tought him to be a good person and this is awesome. My parents raised me with a strong set of values, I know for sure that I would have done the same. I've done so many times. What I find sad is that it seems like a surprising thing... When did our society become like this? What it should be generally shared (be a good person) it seems so rare nowadays... 😞
Amazing young man ♥ Maybe if more stories like this were shared, the world would be a different place.
It’s the fine young man😂 estás mujeres jajajajaja
Fair play to the boy
hmm i wonder why he would drive to go see Melina 😂
What a good kid❤
It's a shame that something that should be normal is now something that's special or rare.
I am so happy that she did not accuse him thank you Jesus and I was glad he got blessed.
Mans looked at her id & said “damn she kinda fine” 💀
America moment
I’m glad to see people doing the right thing and expect nothing, It makes me even more glad when they get a surprise reward as they deserve ✊🏼 hope everyone can carry this good feeling throughout their days even when it’s hard and look for selfless acts of kindness to do to others as well.
Last time I returned someone's wallet, they gave me a peppermint 😒
Praise the Lord up above to this young man’s mom to all parents in this country we need to raise our kids like that , because if we did this country will be a better place!
What a good lad 💓💓😭👌
Ok let’s me honest he got that much cause he white 😂 if it was a black or Mexican or Asians ya would say we stole it 😂
The definition of integrity. Well done.
Yes yes yes ❤️ Good job young man!!
lol I mean anyone can do this stunt feel like a false energy ritual forms of selling out out there not that hard💰
Que lindo gesto,todavía existen personas honestas que recuerdan lo que sus padres o abuelos le inculcaron.Bendiciones!!
And he’s cute?!?!
BREAKING NEWS: A kid decides to NOT become a thief!
His parents should be very proud of this young man.
what a guy!
Call the cops...HAHAAHHAAHAAAHAHAAAAHAAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAAAHAH
theres hope for this world  ❤
i would of asked too take her out as well 😁
Hope the teen is doing well and maintains his good deed doings, if that makes sense... lol
So happy to know that there is still some good in this hard times. For someone as Adrian, his appearance and all, you might write him off as a good person. Am glad he was true to his mom and community by his good deed. We need more of such people in this crazy world.
People do this type of thing every single day because it's the right thing to do.
True story...left my wallet at a BK cash was taken out wallet turned in to bank up the street who in turn called me.....they got good deed half right.🤣
Wats her ig
i love this!
We❤️this ty gen-z! There is hope.👍
Here comes all the white haters
🙌🙌🙌
He was raised the right way...what a great young man 💯
I ain't gone lie .. somebody find his IG or cash app ima send bro something. He so young its amazing to see bro thinking like that. Respect 💪🏾💪🏾🤞🏾💙💯
Only in america  people get on the news for doing basic civilised things..
They gave him some ass little do we kno
Our ultimate reward on earth 🌎 of God 🙏 for good through faith is eternal life. Pray, that he receives more then monetary gain.
his parents must be so proud of him, Such a good boy he is god bless him ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Dude just did what he knew was right, now he's up $15k so far. It doesn't hurt to so the right thing, people!
I've always said that no one should judge a book but its cover and this is the proof. This young man can use that money I'm sure but why stop there. Someone needs to take him by the hand and put him out there where everyone can see a true act of humanity that so many of us have given up on. This has given me 1,000% of hope thats no where to being dead on today's society. This young man has a message to everyone out there and someone needs to help him get out there and spread that message of hope and love. Hold your head high young man and never stop being you!!! Best of luck to you and yours.....
Well raised proud 👩
God bless this young man 🙏🇺🇸
Keep showing your integrity king
Thank you.
He did it with no intention of getting anything from the owner. The world needs people like him.
He took pictures of her card 💀💀
💯🙏
Fair play to this guy !!
I don't know why I think this was staged and he knows the ladies.... cool story though. I loved this!!!
He returned that cuz she was hot
What a guy! His parents must be so proud of him. The world would be a beautiful place if we were all like this.
I'd have robbed tf outta her then went and got that reward.
Good boy
The gofundme is at 15k now
Nobody's  returned  mine   last 10 years
Plot Twist he was the one who stole it. Double money reward 😂.
Good job, young man!
Its all about how you raise your children and being strong enough to continue doing so
Now I want to see a video of him receiving the reward.
This is wrong. Which in Germany IT is a crime to do NOT so.!
Hell yes big dog keep being awesome 💪
I once found a credit card outside. Decided to look up the name and it turned out to be a local doctor. He said his wallet had been stolen and the card was already canceled but thanked me and asked me to mail it to him anyway so I did. A week or so later I was surprised to get a letter from him with a bunch of gift cards to the movie theater. I took a girl I was seeing and we had a nice night.
woahhh i never knew a human teen could be this nice, he got what he deserved!!
Lol people still dress like that?
PERIOD
God Bless him! 🙌
i always return stuff back because of the same reason that if it were mine i’d want it returned  and i have a few times but i’ve also ran into some mean ppl who don’t even say thank you they just grab their stuff from my hand and turn around and leave like … ur welcome
Someone tell that nice young man to stop dressing like a not so nice young man.   People don’t profile based on race they profile based on how you present yourself - and most people that look like that aren’t going to be too good.
Awesome young man well brought up thanks to his mom
altough is impressive. i think he is good looking, thats why he get so much attention.
God bless you young man!🙏🙏🙏👏👏👏
He related to them they did this 😂 to have a good reason to "gofundme" now they all got more money 💰
Much respect to this guys and the women for blessing him🙏🏽
What a legend
Imagine thats news worthy.. just in America
Awesome kid. Good job!
1 in a 1,000,000
So happy to see such a well raised young man!     Why should one need a 3k reward for doing the right thing?
Found a wallet in front of a convenience store years ago. opened it and it was full of cash. I went in the store and announced finding it. The teller then stated it's that guy he walking towards home to find it. I yelled for him to come back. He thanked me and said that was all the money he had. I was glad he got it back. I think he said there was 250.00 bucks.
Am really proud  of him, everyone would  do this, nice of you young man
Didn’t take anything out your purse how did he find the address? He had to look for something didn’t go thru it. How would u know.  1. His hand was in his pocket. Gotta spot these. I’m becoming an Homicide detective an u gotta spot all the small stuff.
This kid gonna have a blessed life, respect where it’s due
I wish I got paid thousands of dollars to do good deeds but who knows maybe karma will pay me in the future
He looks like a person who would take it not hatein tho if he did or not.
There still some good people out there. 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
ahhh so refreshing
My wife has found two purses on different occasions outside  our local supermarket. The first was a young lady who was absolutely devastated shed lost it and when we gave it to her she cried. The second was a wallet with £350 cash, credit cards, bank cards the lot in it. The owner had business cards in it, so we rang him. He was 5 mins away, so we drove to meet him.When we returned it, he just joked about how stupid he was, but didn't say thank you 😐  No we're not after a reward 😂
Credit to the kid and his parents for bringing him up.
Good to know still good people out there which care about others and don't want just getting advantage on others. We must reward everyone teen doing that to encourage other to do the same. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🚔🚨👮🏻‍♂️👉🏻💨
It would have been a perfect story if Adrian wore his pants on his waist instead of his knees
I want this kid to have a successful life.
Well done young man. There’s plenty of good people left, they just normally aren’t highlighted like this
An eg of integrity..
Good Parenting results in GOOD KIDS
At one point I thought this was going to turn into a CBS how to catch a predator, meaning the teen got rewarded in MILF pleasure... But nope, my sick mind was not rewarded this time 🤣🤣
More news like this PLEASE
There still is good people out there! Shout out to the mom for raising a very respectful and honest son! And shout out to you man good things happen to good people just takes time🤘🏻
L
This warms my heart
Good kids come from great parents!
he so fine
With those medals round his neck I would say he didn’t need the purse 😅
His car though🚘😈
What a great young man... But it's sad that him doing the right thing is a surprise! It should be the norm!
Man he was probably the one who stole it SMH😂😂
Project zorgo is watching
Losing something can be really bad. Even if its a small thing.
Man's decided to return the purse instead of stealing it like in Gta 5 and got a huge reward
sad thing is people judge by looks and race..
And he’s such a handsome young man! Girls that’s the one you need to be trying to talk to right there! You better go beat down his door before he gets snatched 😂
Wonderful young man ❤️❤️
It starts from the parents
Don t book a cover by its judge 🥰
So dope!!! This is very rare. His momma raised him right!
He's a good boy returning somebody's purse
Need him
Nahh he seen the id and said imma hit it watch this
What a blessing
The GoFundMe has raised almost $15k as of today!
There is still a hope 🥹
This is a great story that we needed to hear during these troubling times. That young man is truly a good Samaritan with a lot of good in him. We need people like him to be the example this world needs.
This young man has a bright future
in the real world as a man you would be arrested for doing this. you show up to a women's house in the evening/night with her purse she will take the purse and call police on you asap. DO NOT DO THIS, IF SOMETHING AIN'T YOURS JUST DON'T TOUCH IT.  this looks great with the cameras, but in the real world this would not work out the way it did here.  Good luck beating all the charges you will get hit with, theft, sexual harassment and stalking. Please do not do this if you're a man.
Amen
yea!
Nice lad! Hope he puts it towards something he wants.
There's "hope" yet. 😊
What a great guy🥰god bless him
What a great guy🥰god bless him
finally some good news for a change
six months ago i found the wallet of a soccer player, he plays in italy and earns very well. I handed the wallet at the training center and never heard from him again. his bank cards and all IDs were in there.
I think that woman was more happy they were both of hispanic, central or south american descen - I don't know, they all look alike to me..
Wrong is wrong even if everybody is doing it, right is right even if no one does it
Selfless
Plot twist: he was the mf that stole it in the first place lmao
Great job 👍🙏
dude has my name lol
Jesus spoke about this in the new testament. Love God with all of your heart, Love your neighbor and treat others as you would want them to treat you. Even if you don't believe in Jesus, there is always a reward in doing the right thing. His mom taught him very well.
Lit✊🏾
I know his parents raised him right and everything but the thought had to go through his head when he looked at the license "damn she's bad I'm going to return this purse" hehehee
And her video goes viral and she earns it back with ads
bless that kid hopefully he rubs off on the next kid as far as doing a good deed
Parents raised him right
Someone left a credit card when I was a server at Applebee's, and I looked the name up on FB and found them in a few min and shot them a message. She came back 10 min later and thanked me, card in hand. But one of my coworkers called me creepy for it bc I looked them up on FB. It was just the fastest way I could think of lol
There is hope for this young generation. Nice guy  raised by his parents well.
👏👏❤️❤️🙏🙏
Her mam proud of him..
Big applause to the Mom!! She raised him so right!! *SUCH A GENTLEMEN* ❤
✊🏾
Wow what a kind and thoughtful young man!! IMO If there would be more people like him this world would be a better place... IMO...
Homie
So a kid returns a lost purse and it reaches the news?! Seriously, props to the kid, but isn't that a normal thing to do?
That's a cool story bro. I found a professional soccer players wallet and returned it to him and got jack squat and another time I found a lawyers wallet, returned it to him and got jack squat and one time I found a drug dealers wallet and got it back to him and he gave me 50 bucks.
Seems like a fake story to me just to make money don't trust these people at all seems shifty the story and there eyes 👀
Seriously, give this man a job, a scholarship, an internship or at least a reccomendation letter.
Tight ass wouldn't even give him $20
humanity🥰  honestly speaking, when we judge quickly with his appearance, you don't think he is that kind of teenager. bow to his parents and to him coz he listens.
This teen is the only teen i respect in this generation
I get handed a lot of wallets at my job. Keep better track of your personal items. This kid did the right thing 👍🏻.
I was 16 when I found a Phone with a wallet case. At least $1000 dollars. I had returned it too the owner who was hanging out on their front lawn with friends, a block party was happening on that block. I’m walking up to people asking if their name matched the ones on the credit card. Long story short I return the phone/money without receiving a thank you… which is all I really wanted. I’m glad this kid got the recognition he deserves… as well as the people being as grateful as they should be for finding their lost stuff.
the news actually reporting something heart warming and good? LOVE to see it!
The fact that this is a big deal is pathetic you should return anyone's things standard without thinking about anything else.
What a great kid!!!! This is what the world should be like. His mother deserves more than a pat on the back! PROUD MAMA!!! God bless!!
That's a good kid right there. What a gentleman 👏🏿  and his mum's a good parent.  If I lost my wallet I'd freak. Not just because of the cash I don't keep much on me but for all my work tickets and the hassle of canceling and reordering new bank cards.   He's right for that one and even though good deeds come from the heart and shouldn't be expected to be rewarded. He'll I'd have easily slipped him a 50 dollar bill.   These women  really went beyond and I'm glad it worked out for everyone.
be the change u want to see. Gondi. we can build up good Karma in our lives or build up bad Karma. like the young man said, i would want someone to bring me back my stuff if i lost it. now good will come this young mans way, in ways money can't buy
Congratulations  for the  parent they do good job 😇👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
We cant change overnight but we gotta start somewhere🤝
go fund page now at $15,000 !
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL MAN!!! THANK YOU SIR. WAY TO GO. SHOW THE REST OF THE WORLD HOW HOW TO LIVE LIFE. THANK YOU TO YOUR MOM TOO!! MUCH LOVE AND BLESSING TO YOU.
Now he got money and I’m sure the ladies want to meet him 💪 💯
Always nice to see some goodness in the world.
why does this seem so staged to push illegal immigration?
I'm trying to find Eliana Martin. She's gorgeous
This is what most ppl think they gone get but get nothing
And he's also cute. Young man gonna go far in life.
You know the world is broken when people get rewarded for doing the obvious, doing the right thing and raised with values.
Yeah its nice but what kind of society do we live in that bringing back a purse is rewarded with 3000$? Like what
since nobody said , He is so fine. 😭
Good boy!
He looks more like someone who takes purses
This was a lovly story, why does the lady sound like Cardi B?
He saw her ID. Mans was probably trying to clap them cheeks.
plot twist he knows your daughter and wants to smash lol
The Golden rule that Jesus taught us
Also hats off to those two beautiful women who did not take his selfless act for granted and even shared his good deed on social media and even raised funds for him. I'm really happy to see this side of the world.
I just stumbled upon this video randomly, he and my father share the same name, I had to replay it just to make sure caught me off guard lmao
really touched me... wish we had fine young men like him... all around the globe. would make this world a  better place to live.
I mean sure, these good deeds should be rewarded. But if that was me or anyone I know, they would do the same. I must live in a good neighbourhood or something.
So happy to hear about this story.  I hope he keeps being that amazing man his mom is raising him to be. 🥰
Much respect for this young man. God bless
He's the one who stole it in the first place 🤣
What’s crazy is if you look at his dress code (which is fresh by the way) he doesn’t look like the type to bring a purse back, that’s why you don’t judge a book by the cover
This young dude will definitely be hired wherever he will apply for work. This good did alone speaks for itself.
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍♥️✌️🤘💯💖🥰🥀🙏👏👏👏👏👏👏🙏🙏🙏🙏
This is what the media needs more coverage of instead of the negativity
How did inside edition find out? Did she actually go them them and say "look at this good deed I've done!"
Good karma for this lovely young guy xx
3k dislikes clearly would just rob the bag >.<
He was tryna clap
Lowkey wanna be friends with this man fr
"there's hope for our younger generation" what a stupidly ignorant thing to say
ㅋㅋㅋ 아니 당연한거 아니야??? 미국 도덕기준이 굉장히 낮은 듯.. 이걸 갖고 뉴스까지 만든다고????
God loves yall and Jesus Christ is returning soon and repent,
closer to 4000 but okay who's counting.
Plssss
Go subscribe plssss
Bruh if he was white it wouldn't blow up
This boy is very fortunate I think. A lot of good deeds stay unappreciated.   But what different accents these all have - tv host and these two women.  Damage is done to my not native English speaker's ears.
Ppl do good stuff everyday more honest stuff then him and never get any recognition
Now if many of you can stop judging a book by its cover!
🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
Loved this. Good job young man.
I once returned 2 lost wallets I only got a lollipop from the bank and the other one turned out to be a close family friend to my best friend lol small world
I meaaaan when you look at the id lol
A little birdy told me they know this dude, and it was all an act 🤭🤫
homie saw the picture in the license and knew what he had to do
Me being a black man and seeing this go way left for black kids and teenagers for years I wholeheartedly expect him to get a gun pulled out on him before I watched this video
Bless his heart I would be proud ❤ about time ! Raised right that's 4sure !  Good job who raised him lets hope he is the next president! Wow 👏
Dude is 17 and tatted up. Smh
How I'm raising to my son to be what good honest guy
Good mom creats good man!
Kid looks gangsta but does more good than most people.
You old folks should take notes from us youngsters And he’s a cholo so shout out raza.
Love this, everything about it! ❤
So beautiful bless his heart and soul . I love random acts of kindness. Good job ! 💛🥰
Doing the right thing while no one is looking is called having character. My parents have a magnet on our fridge with this thought.
Maybe just a sceptic. They “raised” over $3,000 but was never mentioned how much they actually gave him. Also a bit odd we did not hear from him. Hope it played out as portrayed.
Man it's nice to see some kids still get raised right.. awesome  young man... thanks for sharing
🤩🤩🤩🤩
Thats what real people do.  Good on you, man!
The dude prolly checked the ID and the only reason he returned it is cause the lady is hot af I can promise y'all that
619 hospitality.
He saw inside the purse and realised there is nothing to steal as such. So then he thought if I return the purse I might get some reward. And he got the reward. Or he thought he would be captured on cctv camera for picking up the purse that's why he returned it.
Kind & Honest
big W for Adrian
He looks like a criminal drugs street gangster😂😂
How is this news? In Denmark we do this everyday but we don’t get put on the news
He can get this cooter too
This world needs more good deeds like this being shared, not just the doom and glood we get on a daily basis.
I think there is no money in purse😂😂😂
Good boy
Need more peoples like him in nowadays💪
I'm amazed about the fact that this seems a very rare occurrence in the US, which is something completely normal in Germany. Here you get your lost stuff back 99% of the time.
Kudoes to.the young man!!  Yes! Perhaps there is hope for the future in the United States of America! Thank you for sharing.
Idol☺✌
haha reminds me when my mom found some new iphone on the ground, no one anywhere nearby. she redialed the last called number, the mom of the owner picked up, and proceeded to curse out her own son for losing his then-new phone, and proceeded to not give any more contact info😂😂 she was fuming. my mom tried calling her again a few hours later, by that time the son picked up and so they managed to meet up and he got his phone back, but like if it was on his mom, he would have never gotten his phone back, in the name of teaching him a lesson. lol
bro fine asl
He’s cute as well
Good man
This will probably change his life as well. Even if you’re a good person, having positive reenforcement goes a long way as well
I am proud of this honest young man, doing the right thing.
A mother raised a man
God Loves You, He's is offering you forgiveness, love and compassion he wants you to live a Holy Life and Abide in his Word, John 15:7. Accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior, Amen! ❤️.
There is hope 😍
Amen,
then the women stole his raised money
What a good lad
0:07 not with tiktok around 💀💀💀
I found 700$ at work and I didn’t get a thing 💪🏾 bless to this young guy
This is literally the bare minimum that should be expected from a human being.
Amazing.. They taught him well.  What a great person.  Now, if they could only teach him how to use a belt properly... lol
Lil thuggo probably the one who stole it. You ever seen an honest hard-working man wear a baseball cap like that? Nope, it's always the dirty thugs wearing their hats like that
plot twist: he stole it
funny video
Hopefully this kid...goes on to later have kids. So he can raise more good people in this world. There's way too many bad eggs in this world having kids doing exact opposite. Glad to see theres still good in this world any more!
Good thing on the news for once, it has become so draining lately
Most people would of said he’s a punk kid, or typical Mexican kid!  I’m so proud of him for doing the right thing!
What a beautiful hearted young man!
He deserved that reward, its really devastating to lose a possession outside because sometimes it has sentimental value and you cannot replace it. I remember i lost my wallet once and it had my license in there and money and cards, they actually used my money to buy things and most of all i really loved that wallet and the replacement I got didn't feel the same. I lived nearby, they could've done a good thing but no.
👍
Let’s be honest here. He saw the pretty ladies Picture on her license and wanted to shoot his move. I would have done the same thing.
Great example set, young man
this is great
Such an amazing story, good lad! It's not hard to be nice people, lead by this kids example.
So shines a good deed in a weary world.
This story is awesome!
Plot twist he was the thief and thought this act would get him more money
I love this story.  Thank you (and him!).
I bet his mama is smiling from ear to ear right now. Good job Adrian!
Good kid!!
He brought the purse because he wanted to shoot his shot after seeing her ID 😂
Hey...wow !....All the guys will now see this as a money-making operation.......Steal a purse.....Return it to the owner....Get a fat reward////////////////Unfortunately it doesn't always work this way but the half wit "youth" of today won't figure it out.
Y’all needa start putting the go fund me links in the description boxes , don’t be jealous 😏
Its a nice thing for these people in the comments cuz they would never think if doing somthing like that ....llooll
Such a good Samaritan. His parents raised him right!! Good boy. My faith in humanity has been restored. God bless you.❤️😇
May God bless him for doing the right thing. 🙏🏽
If I'd seen her driving license, I'd go to return the purse everyday.
😏
Great young man, I hope more people who already aren't strive to be like that, willing to do the right thing even for people you don't know.
About 10 years ago subway charged me  .90 cents for my sub instead of the usual 12.90 or whatever. I wanted to be a good Samaritan, so I went back to let them know. I thought they would say thanks and give me a cookie or whatever or say it's on the house for my honest, I don't know what I was thinking. I was very young and naieve. Instead they said "oh thanks for that" and changed me the remaining amount and I have never been back to subway since.
is that street called Grove Street by any chance?
No lie...I returned a man's wallet once with over $800, credit cards, ID's, etc. He thanked me and gave me a quarter. True story.
Never judge a book by its cover
Sorry but I ain't buyin it chick just so happens to look like could be my mans shawty🤣🤣
Beautiful act of kindness. Well done to that young man 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I hope the virtue seeking you tubers take a page out of his book
“There’s hope for the new generation” said every previous generation forgetting that the new generation is people like themselves and is our future! It’s truly silly to treat them like losers. Teach them well and be proud of your children!
Because god is watching 🌹
His mother did a wonderful job raising up the young man.
A 3k reward is too high but his genuine kindness is even higher.
Finally American don't have the teen gunshots ppl..lol it's the first time a good young guy
His Mum taught him correctly 💯❤✝️
wow we don’t usually see this with this skin color
To all thieves out there, if you return something you gonna get even more money than if you steal it, and you gonna get an amazing self confidence.
I already saw this on the hub
praises to this honest young man and his mom 🙏
Returning someone’s lost property goes viral. Only in America
This is beautiful 👌
His Mom deserves an award too 👏🏻 for raising a respectable young man with good morals!
The boy surely comforted a lot of people who have given up on people. Including me. Bravo young man. Wish you a great future.
he’s better than me, i would’ve took the money💀
Bro saw her license and thought he’d shoot his shot 😂
I’m proud ❤️
Awesome
tis aint no human behaviour
That is a good story, and all do to his upbringing.
Nice to have some one in the younger generation setting the bar. I bet his parents a so dang proud of him. He’ll be successful in life if he continues down the path he’s heading.
Some drugs and jail time can change that attitude.
Integrity is essential. Thank you Adrian
Plot twist : It was not her purses.
Atta kid!
They could just have gave him that 🤡
Nice! We need more people like him
Okay i love that he did that but can we talk about his style in clothes n how cute he is ...whats his ig ..insta?😭😭
“Always do the right thing, even when no one is looking”, Adrian, your mom did a great job raising you. She must be so proud
Pull a sigma male face for this boy
👍👌💐
😭😭😭😭😭 I Love this guy. GOD BLESS HIM. Thank u Mom for raising ur Beautiful son right. ❤️  Sending Huggs n Prayers to all 🙏🤗 Keep doing GOD'S  work young man. U ROCK 😉
And he could’ve gotten shot if a racist opened the door.
Wow so sweet. 💕
Bravo, young man. There is good in this world, I wake up and think of all the terrible things. Something that seems as simple as this can brighten your day. His mom raised him right, and he listened. That's beautiful.
Respect to this young man and especially his mama. God bless them
Mommy👉👈
good karma to the young lad!
making someone happy is more fulfilling than taking what isn't yours just for $100 or $200 bucks. I don't know how much she carries, but I assume she just uses her cards like the rest of us.
god bless
Cuz he was raised properly on morals and honesty... GOOD ON YOU KID...💪👌💚 THE FUTURE COULD BE BRIGHTER WITH GUYS LIKE ADRIEN 💯👊
There was a time when this would have been the norm for most people to do, just shows how society has declined when such an honest and decent act now makes a major news story... but well done to the lad 👍
My mum, who is 80, did the same when she found a lady's bag on a bench in a park. She took the bag home with her and asked a neighbour to call a "husband" (contact on the phone that was in the bag) because she can't use a smart phone herself. The neighbour gave them my mother's address and soon both the owner of the bag and her husband showed at my mother's door and collected the bag. As a sign of gratitude they gifted my mom a lovely set of six ice-cream bowls with matching spoons.
Probably stole it and felt bad afterwards, we know what it is, I've been a teen.
Myyy man, god bless u 🙏
I wish we could have more people like him in the world
Young man bless you YouTube you did good
It shows how important parenting the right way means
My dude prob gave it a comb through and was like sheeeeeesh she down bad bruh, gotta return this.
Here one can see the importance of good mothers. Feminism destroys that kind of mothers.
Good man
Doing the right thing when nobody is watching is the the hallmark of integrity.
They're rich af and they put up a fundraiser to reward him???
omg
Parents of this young man would be so proud.
aw
I think this is a rigg
God bless you kiddo 🙌
He was tryin to holla. If she was ugly, that purse would’ve been gone.
justice for targeted individuals
Boring
Wow gif bless him his mom did a good job b he taking hear learning proud of u boy
It's nice how he even located the house to return the purse, he didn't just leave it in lost and found or whatever. I like the point he made about wanting something of his lost returned to him. Sadly our culture isn't often this honest. It's nice to see a young person doing a good thing.
idc what yall say this man fine asfff😍.
Crazy we live in a world that we praise and honor someone that simply does the right thing and gets a $3k reward.
Of course he a Rodriguez 😉
Why does the thumbnail look like GTA sa ultra realistic mod
bro he probably just wanted to get some ass... pinche vato
Im really trying my best to understand why this is such a mindblowing good act. This is pretty standard in Denmark. It must be extremely rare that people return things to the owner when a fundraising is created for this young man 😂😂😂
I also found a rich womans handbag. It was in the middle of busy main road. I stopped car jumped out and ran over and grabbed it and ran back to car, lucky not to hold up any traffic. Must have looked like a lunatic. She had EVERYTHING in there.  I pulled over at supermarket and phoned up some company numbers on her cards and told them to give her a ring and tell her to ring me. 5 mins later she rings and I arrange to meet her where I am at the supermarket carpark.  She takes 20-30 minutes, but I dont mind waiting as I look forward to my praise and hopefully nice reward.  She arrives and gets her bag back, thanks me like its nothing and drives off. Wheres my $3000? The reason I did it was because Ive lost wallets before and just wished so much that whoever found it would just contact me. Keep the cash - I dont even care - just give my wallet and personal cards and stuff back.  Also found 2 cell phones belonging to 20 year old students that I messaged online to find. Neither gave any reward but they were just poor students.
We all know why he returned it 😏
This speaks a lot about America, a lot of people in America would never return lost items.
God bless this kid!
''kudos'' MY GOOD  MAN  MY   PARENTS  TAUGHT  ME  THE   SAME WAY==BLESSINGS==
God bless this kid!
How about having a three-some for a reward? These two ladies look the could put that thang' on ya' until you can't even walk.
It costs nothing to be nice to others. Honesty takes you miles ahead. Dishonesty is not a road to take as you will never have true friends. Good deeds brings good people and good karma into your life.
I thought that was the most normal thing to do. But still very nice.
thats normal here in europe btw
Nice
Finally, there's hope. Living proof
If I were that kid I would've taken all the money and disappear.😁              -Triggered ppl👇
And he handsome too
I had done the following good deeds (and I didn't asked for any rewards) :- 1. Saved a baby in a pool 2. Returned a Sony Ericson phone to a couple (worth $1,800) 3. Returned a wallet (only left the IC and nothing else) 4. Retuned a misplaced iPhone 13 on a ATM recently (worth $1,900 or above) 5. Donated all my youtube income to help the Myanmar poor people and yet got baised so badly by a lightworker and so many past good deed I done I cannot remember. And yet now I am suffering from chronic Osteoarthritis and been suffering for years, WTF is wrong with this world?
This goes to show that all starts in the family! Well done to the young man and his parents xxx
Must be something really wrong with the world when this normal thing is such a big news story
Im looking for lost purses
Love and humanity restore
His mother 💕🙏
God bless you 🙏
😃
Such a cool guy!
Fairplay most people would’ve just taken the purse. I remember I lost my wallet before, probably had about £300.00 cash inside. It was returned empty lol.
Мой видос какой небудь покажите.
fake af
Not just $3,000 but $3,800?? awesome 😭😭
This gave me hope in this world.
Scripted
Momma raised him right
No money in the purse so he gives it back and gets 3 grand 😁💯💯
because she was hot he was coming over to spit game
Probably saw how pretty the woman was and wanted to meet her 🤪
Because there wasn't any expensive valuables or large amount of cash. Simple.
I’m sure the value in purses these days is worth way more than 3K if you consider all the cards these days. They did well, bless them!
massive respect to him.
Nino mona ngoba akusiyini enthole le reward😕
This is the type of young man we need in the future to lead others in the right direction. Very happy to have seen this.
A lot of Americans should learn these beautiful good deeds and follow them to improve the social community.
She thicker than a bowl of oatmeal.
Brought up right usually means his family is is educated and has money.
All that happened to me was someone draining all my credit cards 🙃
Look at his face, of course he's honest
The purse definitely had 300k thats why he got 3k back 😂
He was definitely raised right by his family
Got $10,000 in another post....
I’m Uber driver for the last 8 years and returned valuable staffs to my riders including diamonds , money, phones ,rings and wallets etc but no one will rewarded me more than 15 bucks . Actually that 15 bucks is Uber rewards the driver for the lost item . But I am still happy to return riders valuable staff and happy to see them laugh and cry.
integrity
Eveerytime a good deed happens in america iT goes on the news ( please dont offended this is a joke)
I’m glad I watched this
Man mad respect young man 💯. You gonna go far sir.
Whys this a big deal? I have done it and went to a mans home after seeing an address in his wallet, but I did not even get a thank you 😂 the man literally took his wallet and turned away. I was dissappointed tbh but I made a good deed and im happy about it so its alright
Simpppp
I'm proud of him. Did the right thing.
The right one could pay better 😈😈
“Always do the right thing, even when nobody’s looking”   Such a strong message in a day and age where many only pretend to care and do a good deed for social media likes and recognition and not because they’re a genuinely good and kind person.  Well done to this young man.
Great Kid! Great Parents! Kudos for showing everyone how it pays to do the right thing!
Omg, humanity has got to the point where returning a purse is a newsworthy story. In Japan, this is the norm
Kind of sad that this is newsworthy when any decent human being would regard it the most normal thing in the world. I guess you don't have many of those.
How he go the address tho? Confused
Небось он сам и украл эту сумку... "герой"...
Great kid.
He checked the purse   It was just $235  Guys got class
Don't judge book by its cover. Bravo young man 👏👏👏👏👏👏
His parents did a great job raising him.....Brilliant
Excellent job brother!
I did this last month, found a wallet outside of the Dollar Store. It contained a lot of credit cards, ID and $60. I gave it to the manager and came back one hour later to check if the owner retrieved it. Sure enough, he came back and got his wallet. He said thank you!
High sock activities
Says enough about her that she takes this positive thing and uses it to bring down an entire generation. THeRe'S hOPe FoR oUR yOUnGer GeNeRAtIoN
❤️❤️❤️🥹🥹🥹
One of the only young people who aren’t thugs
yes. my mom too (:
Good kid, good parents. All Around great story
Lmao no doubt this man stole it the first place.
Heartwarming
Tell me where you'll forget your purse again so I can bring it to you and get $3k 😂🤣
Way to go Adrian!!!
Once a returned a wallet with 15 credit cards, over $600 and many more things. I got nothing in return, zero.
His lucky he was not returning it to a white family. They would have blamed him for stealing it or shot him
Refreshing
Beautiful ❤❤praise God
okay but what’s his @ tho??? 😭
He looks like an up to no good character and still he did the right thing.
wow someone returned a bag, that's definitely news....
Representing SD like real one
We need some more people like him in this world
Of course there is hope. Be good people and we will have a WONDROUS world!    Yes... mind blowing. But it really is that simple. Forget that you can get hurt. Be good to eachother. And you wont have to die to get to heaven anymore. 🥰
He said he wants to do good even when no one is watching, well God is watching 24/7 so
Bruh her husband’s face When she Said she rewarded him 3k 😂😂
Oil pressure sensor bet !
looks like a theme for  new shameless episode
Oh man, i mean what would he do with  credit cards, cheap perfume, pot, make-up, cigarettes, femine napkins he found there?
Omg is that a birkin
Wow extremely impressive 👏 good for him, hope he gets great karma all throughout his life 🙏
damn he bout fine asl too
Respectful and fine ? shi
His better than me. Salute to him
Such a good guy. His parents should be proud of him🤍
Appreciate his wonderful parents ❤ and such gold hearted man... if i found i might do like him because my parents always do taught us that way. 👍👍
congratulations young man. I'm happy to hear that you were raised right :)
We need more people like this in this world god bless that teen but what he did make him a man💯✊
Finally, not a video about a teen shooter. God bless him & his parents who taught him well and a double measure of blessings to those who recognize his honesty.
He fine af
When she said there's hope for our young generation. Me: 🤔😐
This right here is a fine young man being raised a fine woman 👏👏 I had found a purse at a store and in it was the ladies debit cards and credit cards plus about $1500 cash. Crazy thing is she had her pin number and amount of cash she had written on a sticker on the cards. I was like wth🙊 I knew it was meant for me to find that purse. I kid you not I had just borrowed $10 to buy some bread and hot dogs to feed my kids because I had became disabled recently because of my brain swelling due to stenosis and my spinal fluid not draining in my brain. So then I find a phone and call the number that says daughter. Low and behold the owner of the bag was an elderly woman who just got diagnosed with Alzheimer's 😢 I told the daughter that had it been anybody else they would've wiped her mother clean of her life's saving. Let me just say she had a lot of money🥺🙈 I felt so worried for the lady. The daughter cried and was very grateful. I told her every penny was in that bag and I only went into it to find out how to get in touch with the owner. Even though I am struggling I refuse to take what is not mine. Even though I didn't get rewarded I felt so good that that woman didn't lose her personal belongings. 🙌🏽 I thank God. I know that God always makes a way. This happened like  a month and a half ago. I always look at the carts in the parking lots and find phones and return them. It feels so good to see that sigh of relief on the people's faces😁😁
Haha that is 3,5 of my monthly wage 😅 When I returned 2 wallets with everything in tact and one iphone.....i got "thanks"
He was just doing a GTA side mission
hopefully they let him smash when he turns 18
he lowkey looks an gangster
Their gofundme is almost at 15k
This guy is a hero... wow you don't see this so often...🤎👍
Seems like a good boy
W
I once found the governors ID and other stuff strewn along a street, I went and returned it , she's cold as ice, her secretary played her part,  come out and ask me what I need to see her for , I told her I just found these items on the street, she put her hand out and I gave it to her and she disappeared back into the room. leaving not even a thanks.
Respect for that kid
Good kid right there
Mann I then returned 5 purses back and I ain’t get a dam thing 😅
I lost my wallet with $800 in it on a nature trail. All my identification available for return and I never got it back🙂🙂
Proud of you kid.
Can you least give him 20 bucks??she said wtf
It’s now over $14k 🤯
Finally a tiny bit of kindness during this horrible time in America. Good on yah kid.
Great story. His mama taught him well. Very good deed young man
God bless this boy!
It’s great to see that there’s good people still out there love it
im sorry but his little pose with the purse 😭💓
there is hope lol
Love this story!!!
the bare minimum is seen as such a big deal in our society this is sad lol but props to him
Proud Mum here. Not his. But I am so proud of him.
All of that stuff aside and bro looks drippy af
Wow the Gofundme is over $14,000 at this point, amazing
16k raised as of today
He probably stole it found it empty just ID returned it
Super Dope
Gloria
Isn't this the normal thing to do though? I am glad they're sharing their story but I think that most people would return it.
Geez this plastic surgery🤡
He was tryna get guts🔥🤣
She should let him hit hahah
Don’t judge a book by it’s cover
Nice work Brother!  Brown Pride at its Finest !
Ban plastic
Plot Twist: he stole the purse and returned it for the $3k, he a finessaa
What a sweet young man. It's sad more people, adult or otherwise, can't be more like him
Good man 🍻🎉
Wow amazing job
bro fine
Wooooow. World news. Daaaaaaaaaamnnnn . The most important news to share woooooooow🙄
Wow 😳 amazing young man
you know whats sad,that a good deed is so infrequent that it has to go viral why cant it be normal?
Salama Halikoum, Bonjour. It's BIG Hope for this 🌍.⚡ Humanity Power ⚡ I'mF²oCarrÉ74 🇨🇵 🇲🇦 From France Peace ✌🏽 All Brothers on this 🌍 Keeping Hope & Smile 😇Thanks For this Beautiful Story😇
You mean you don’t have to ban books and ban the word gay you just have to raise youre kids right?!?! WHATTTT!!!!!
Don’t judge the book by the pants 👖I mean cover
95% of trader lose learn to hold. No one goes from broke to rich without market pain. Stop selling and buying on emotion. Buy. Hold. Get through the pain. In 10years you"ll do great. Don't buy meme coins.
His Parents must be so proud! 🤩
перевод ужасный  или они так общаются ? ему мама говорила что  он не он , а ОНА:)  :)  я понял у американцев нет он, она у них есть оно:) есть три вида пола мужской , женский и деревянный вот американцы третий пол!! снова две подруги ЛГБТ  набирают популярность  в сша  . Но я так скажу в цивилизованном мире нет месту извращенцам !
Good job😊💕
It's awesome to see that some of our young men out there have outstanding character... I hope this inspires more youth to follow in his footsteps...
remember back when this was normal
See all is not lose in mankind, great young man, bless u
Две сочные милфы могли бы и отблагодарить пацана.
No lie. If I'm the kid, I see a hot milf on the ID, I'm also returning the purse and see if it leads to anything.
He looks like the type that would usually steal it 😂
How amazing! 🥰🥰 love this
She did NOT just lead with that… 🙄
🙂👍
This young man's parents deserve 50% of the reward.
Another good example of why we shouldn't judge the book by its cover. This young man looks like the exact type of teen that would take people's purses rather than return them (no offense bro). When in doubt, believe in the good in people first.
so nowadays if you do something right they put you on TV news?
I love this 💓
funny how these random good deed videos always have a gang banger looking dude eh? Liberal media trying to paint them as good people to get votes, despite the facts
God bless 💖✝️🙏🏻
Hes most definitely having sex with her and they set this up for a bit of camera time and to make him look good. Woman will do anything for this kinda guy these days lol
W video
Adriens/Adrians always know the right thing to do ;)
This guy is a real one
He seen the chicks ID and was like I'm going to see that freak in person.  Good things come to those who find purses of fine women.
he's cute
Im in  Dubai rn,  and Why the hell does news like this even make it on national headlines 😂?
1:21 Boy Rings the door bell of a white republican: "911 what's your emergency" "Oh Gaawd, there is a Nakker with his hands in his pocket politely ringing my door bell, and i feel like unloading a full AR-15 mag on him officer"

Shout out Adrian and his mom 🥰💕💕
Post maxwell the billionaire kid trafficker who had sex with other rich people u guys watch daily
Aww he even carried the purse all the way over there 😭 my boyfriend won’t even carry my purse or hold anything for me because he’s too embarrassed 😞😅
3k wtf
Aww
Fake
If only everyone thought that way ❤️ What a lovely boy with a lovely mother who taught him well.
Great job kiddo! Your momma did a great job raising you! Bless you!!!
This is what young Americans should be! Thanks much!
What a great kid, his parents must be very proud to have raised an amazing young man!💖
God bless you
who's put the onion in here ?
Love to see this
WHATS GOOD ESE
Nice!
🔥🔥🔥🙏 now invite em to your bedroom 1 year from now. 😫🤣🤭
And if someone else found the purse and took any valuables and left the purse for Adrian to find which he then returns. The outcome might have been different
bro doing gta side quests
im ngl if she asked what u want as a reward i woulda tapped both of them women😏😏
No, there isn’t hope for the young generation.
If I were him I wouldn't take the rewards
3K? She has a 100k face? Not that it looks good by any means but you can tell she's got the cheddar or her man does.
crazy to think that this isn't the status quo in America. i think here in New Zealand most people would do this and it's considered pretty normal.
Bro def just wanted to smash
👏👏👏 npakabait na bata nito.
Bro looked at the driver license 🥵 Put on a fresh fit, and showed up real quick
Ese looks banged out too 😂
😭 HE LOOKS AND SEEMS SO SWEET, we love him
Salute!
he kinda fine , inside and out lmao
Momma taught him well. Even with that he took it to heart and remembered her lessons while putting them into action.
hes from my city😍
Now that's some good news for a change! I hope this special young man goes far in life. I pray that God will bless him with good health and safety. Last year, I was about to pay for a few grocery items. I noticed the young man ahead of me. When I started to pay, the young cashier told me, 'he paid for yours.' I thought I had heard her wrong! I ran out the door to catch him before he left. He was almost to his car and I called to him. When he turned around, I gave him the biggest bear hug and told him thank you and that I would 'pay it forward'. What a great feeling to still see some love in this world! 🧡
If I came rolling in an Audi i dont need no money!
He probably saw how hot she was on the ID and wanted to risk it for the biscuit
Awesome! Well done young man. More news like this please.
be kind to each other! its free! pass it on!
Blessings I resent   A ladies. 2000$ from cash app she sent me 400💪🏾💚
Good job , mom.
Nice job young man!
How proud his mother must be of her son. She did a fine job raising this young man. He is going to succeed in everything he does because he has character.
That's a good man.🙏and we'll raised 🎉🎉🎉
Good parenting is everything.
Bruh, lo iso por que Eliana se mira buena! 😂😂😂
What would happen if a black teen did the same?
He a little cutie nice gesture he did
Good job salute this dude
✊🏾💯
The only bad thing is that lady who didn’t even gave him 5 dollars at least for him driving there …🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
He is driving an Audi. He probably understands the value of a buck! And he’s totally cool. Love him props man.
10k reward actually
That's what's up....never judge a book by its cover, you do good and it will reward you in the end.. blessings my guy... 💯💯
This make me remind the Greta film 😈
Yeah problem is… There wasn’t much of value in that purse. Trust me… He looked. Ironically enough… He ended up with 3k. As Billy Zane would say… Oh, an honest thief! We have an honest thief here, do we?
That’s good simple acts of kindness goes a long way. Good behavior should be recognized and rewarded as well.
There’s nobody understands he did it because she was bad and he needed the number
This is amazing God bless him.
The place where that 17 yr old boy was standing looked like 'GTA Salandias' 😅😅
He looks like a G...  A Good guy/ Gentleman
Watch and learn
And then he shot someone on the way home.
God loves you all! Also please turn to God and not sin!
Thank you for your report.
God bless him and all involved
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
do the right thing even if no one is looking, God is always watching. See? you had good thing in return 😊😊
wait u drive can alone in california at 16
Cool kid.
Little punk probably took the purse to begin with
Amazing
I never get reward or pass for not cheating in exam :'(
Still good in the world. This story did my heart good. Seeing all these heartbreaking news stories, it was refreshing to see a good story like this. Kudos to the young man and his mom for instilling values in him.
So he went out of his way to return turn her purse and she couldn't give him a reward right then and there that's sad. Regardless if he did it for the money or not it's time for you to be generous.   Reciprotate the energy. When goodness is given it is likely to be returned .
Humanity restored for the day ! Now I can go to sleep
Making Cali look good!! I know people judge mfs by their looks or style but he's shutting that narrative down and it's good to see a youngster with integrity!! He's gonna get a bigger bag by doing things the right way anyway!! That's what's up, glad to see people out there doing positive things for others when they fall down in life no matter the circumstances!
Fake as hell
Cept in gta if u return sum they be giving u like 12$ 😂
This little kid can teach more morality than the all house of representatives
Homie a gta mission payout lol good on him
"Did you at least get my $20 bucks? Mhhhmhhh.. Xcuse me" 😆I don't know why I find that weirdly funny?
I think it’s just sad that doing the right thing is news worthy
LMAOO THIS SO DRAMATIC
Oh wow! He didn´t steal a purse. What a hero!
Bruh, give the kid some credit. Y’all speaking about how wonderful his parents must be, but some parents do raise their kids right and the kids end up criminals and rebels.  The kid’s consciousness is alive elhamdullilah and his heart is pure🤍 May Allah guide him to the light of truth, amen🌻
This is why the saying  NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER!!!! Is so important. Some people just say “oh he’s a thug” ..”he steals”…”this that and whatever else” meanwhile there’s is so many good people out there and they can look any such way! Good on you kid!
Blessings upon blessings to this young man and to the women who were so kind & grateful to him 🥰🥰
Awesome … I love this
Good guy. Keep it up😀
What a good man. Kudos to him and to who raised him
I went to a store today to get a few drinks and had them under the cart. Went down a hill off the pavement part with the cart and all the drinks went rolling. I had two kids with me and one whom is disabled so I was freaking out and a lady stopped and her husband and young son who was maybe 15 or so got out to help me collect everything. That restored my faith in todays youth. 🥰🥰😋
Also reward is another message thanks 😊
Building good karma
He did it just to do it. Not a ton of friends making videos to post. Probably didn't know there was a doorbell cam. Good for him. And his parents.

My guy looks like a gangbanger but look what happened😹
Theres hope in some teens...
I usually skip this part
she looks like azzyland
He just wanted to smash lol
Turns out that they know the kid and set this all up.
I'm a big time skeptic on EVERYTHING so ... is it possible this is an example of another go fund me scam? They all know each other, you bring the purse back, look right into the doorbell camera (cause you know that's a major part of this) then claim they didn't give him a reward initially, even though an Audi is parked in the driveway, the organize a fund raiser to "reward" him and yourselves. Is that accurate? And why does nobody question ANYTHING these days?
if it was me ,i would be just given a handshake
I hope this inspires more kids to make the right choices in life. Well done young man ♥️
Great young man!
Imagine he was the one who stole it lol
That is brilliant. It’s restored my faith in human.
I once returned someones few hundred dollar in return I got “thank you so much, god bless you” I’m not Hindu so I didn’t need his god’s blessing but hey people should award someone who is honest and they did the right thing
Good person
integrity... at it's finest..
They could've drained the little chaps ballz.
Mfs will dislike anything nowdays 💀💀
Wish the person who found my wallet returned it too my house instead of using all my credit cards. I would gave tht person more than what was in my wallet. My ID and pictures were worth more than all the money in my wallet
Plot twist. He actually stole it first. Then, return it.
something tells me he stole it
I’ve done the same thing with cell phones I’ve lost count
More news like this would be nice :)
Dude! I'm here to Salute you
now imagine in a parallel world, when a black man return the lost purse.
This is so cute!!!
It was nice to hear this kind of story compared to hearing about mass shootings every day.
This boy was raised properly by good parents :-) I wish all people were like him. God bless him for doing the right thing, even when no one was watching!!!  Let this be an exceptional example for people today.
So what is the total up to now? Anyone know or have the link?
Respect
"Theres still hope to our younger generations " No, instead Be like him, young and old.. And theres still hope in humanity..
GOD is always watching, do the right thing and good things happen
Or there was nothing in the purse. And he said let me see if there is a reward.
The result of being honest
I like this person and i really wish i could get to be a friend with this type of guy
I love good news a whole lot more than fear pron
That's a good kid right there.
Good Job 🙏🏽💙👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼💪🏼
basically just a good trade     You recive: *b a g*       I recive: 3k
❤️
o pable el yu return.
Lol I helped a drunk man to his house, i do good deeds too😂
You all sicken me. More concerned with what he has on then the kindness In his heart. This kid should be able to wear what ever he wants obviously he was raised right . Honestly the ones stealing the most wear suits
thank lord they aren't racist
Boy don’t need no reward, this how you supposed to be livin already 😂
She is hot and wanted to get into her pants. A dude would never get it.
God Bless Him
Main man gonna have females trying to get ahold of him now.
Gives me a small bit of hope.
If cops saw that dude with the purse, dead
Our plane need that heart to our world green
Dude looks like a GTA V character
"Let's give him a big reward. But let other people do it  'cause I ain't paying for it"
I remember my cousin and I, finding a wallet. when I was 10 we were at the pay phone playing around. It was loaded with cash and credit cards so we seen a police car driving up and gave it to them…. We didn’t know what else to do with it. But my sisters and mad Other people was calling us stupid and miss honest. But you know what, i felt so good inside. I was never really taught to do certain things. It’s just how I was and am to this day. The young man did a great thing. So if nobody down here is watching remember God is🙏🏾,
I returned a iPhone 11 today
Wow over 3k 👏🏽 God bless him 🙏🏽
I don’t know why but I thought if this dumb version of the video *Man gives $3000 dollars to lady for stealing her purse and spending all the money*
That is our real human nature.
That's awesome! Always love good news! Much props & respect to him! & congrats on the $3k+ well deserved for doing the right thing. Good karma💖
Good kid, there is still hope for the future!!
Wow 😲
Yes 👍
He probably found a sugar mom🤣
Good kid
Good kid,great mom
Not all heroes wear capes. This guy has the look of a villain but the heart of a character we all love.
🤣 my man was trying to smash when he saw her I.D. photo
Good job big dog!! We need more people like this man! Well done!
good character!
Raise’em good, and they’ll make you a proud mama.
Fool. If it was a Karen's house he could have get shot 😂
Wrd
Nice
Dope.
GOD BLESS 🙌 🙏
Great kid, great parenting. <3
loved this..
Momma raised a fine young man!
thats a rare breed right there. congrats to the parents who raised the kid
🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥
You guys only came here based on how he looked. Smh
He’s really fine😍🤭
If the Samaritan was blk. That 👜 would of been on offer up or ebay already 😆 🤣
I love him. It reminds of me.
Just do the right thing the rest doesn't matter!
And in this episode of things that didn’t happen
I don't say this often...but sometimes I love people. I love hearing about people going out of their way to help someone.
He is a 17 year old young man... those women should have properly thanked him.
His parents did a good job!
this is the news we need
Good kid raised well
I HATE when people say there's hope for so and so, or hope for the younger generation. Like no, that guy was just a good person. He doesn't represent anyone else but himself and maybe the people around him who helped shape him
I hope this is a true story. If so, that's great!
Dude should have asked her for her number….
Finally! A good story in the media!! Thank you. What a nice guy this one is. What goes around, comes around 🥰
That wasn't an act of kindness, that was being humane!
good job kid...
As a 17 year old myself, this influences me a lot.
Muzzletoff 🥳
Good job, God bless you!
I once found and returned a wallet with several hundred dollars in small bills in it... the owner took the wallet then rummaged through their junk drawer to find and reward me with one dollar in quarters. Gee, thanks a lot...
Your awesome Adrian. Business owners pay attention.  This is who you want as an employee!
Once, a long time ago, our 8 yr old daughter noticed (always a keen observer) that a couple in a restaurant forgot a bag. She immediately notified them; they returned, took the bag and after inspecting its content of more than $ 7000 in travelers checks, continued toward the exit. Did they at least thank our daughter? Maybe, barely. And - the moral of that story?
Love this story.
he’s fine
whats so special i dont get it... since when good deeds is super extraordinary thing? ofc its nice but whats so special about it ?
That's what's up!❤
Faaaaake .....that kid is related to them ...this was just to be on the world lamest show Inside Edition
Good job.
He returned a purse and got a $3k and a Th0t.
he’s kinda cute
what is really sad, is that - a short time ago - this was the way we were all raised to behave and we would have done it automatically. those who DIDN'T do it would have been the odd man out.
To be honest if it was me that found it I will probably take the money and return the rest of it, but after this video I change my mind
Well done young man... Mama raised you right.....
Imagine being in a society where if this happens we need to make a whole news episode about it because it is too rare.
I was tempted pretty heavily the other day. I work in the laundry business and found a customer had left $300 in his pocket. I sat there with that money in my hand knowing that I could easily have kept it and it would simply be gone to the customer. I decided to go back and return the cash. At the end of the day I wouldn’t be able to keep it. Knowing how it is to not have money, be hungry, homeless, I didn’t want to take that money with the idea of I’d be taking food from his family’s table. It was hard to be honest, I wish I could say it was easy, but it wasn’t. But ultimately I’m glad I did the right thing. It’s easy to take something knowing you will get away with it, I hope y’all out there do the right thing though and think about the other persons and what they might be going through. You never know what someone is going through, and that $300 could be nothing to him, but it could also mean the difference between his family eating or not. I don’t know. Doing the right thing though it feels you with some pride. Look out for one another.
Wonder how this would have played out if she wasn’t attractive
all the homies makin fun of him💀
Wow his parents must be incredibly proud.
Much better than boomers
Yes!!!!!
See, God will look out....❤❤❤
Something similar happened to me,in SOCA, he caught the bus across town and delivered to my door step.  I took the 3 20s out and gave them to him.  That guy has not left my heart.
Empathy.   Some right wingers lack greatly.
I love good news ❤️
if she was ugly or didn't live in a rich neighborhood he never would have returned it.
Mission passed.. Respect++
Good man
Plot twist he stol 50 dollars and put fake Monopoly money in
There’s still hope in humanity after all.
I done this one time and almost got sent to prison for it. Also have a record for it now and I done nothing but return their property. To everyone nice deeds get punished 9 of 10 times. I did a good deed and now I pay for the rest of my life so far
Fabulous
Ay am from San Diego CA
I can see myself in him
Way to go. God bless you young man👏👏🙏🥰
Way to go Adrian 👏👏👏👏
Good for him, he has a great mom teaching him the right thing…. Thank you mom♥️
Realistically he only went cause she looked sexy on her ID and hope he can shoot his shot LOL
His mom should be very proud of her son. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
In reality he did steal the purse just to bring it back for a better reward
Once I was struggling with money and found a lady's purse in a shopping cart too and turned in into the checker and the lady saw me outside and ran up and gave me money for turning it in 😭
Plot twist, he was the one who stole it
Bro was tryna get sum
Love to see this in my home town
🫶🫶❤️❤️❤️✨🥺🥰
Integrity!!!
In other news, Police were called to an area across town, just 2 days after the purse incident,  to respond to a loud party involving teenagers who were drunk,  high and all wearing the brand new Jordans and pulling off dangerous stunts while riding brand new electric bikes and skateboards.  Police were shocks and confused where the teens got all these items from.   The case is still under investigation.
I just got a thank you after driving like 10 Miles
Even though this is news it actually cheered me up to know that their is still good people out there
Eliana has one of the goofiest devious looks I’ve ever seen
Rare people. he deserve more than $3k. Somebody may hire him after he graduate school.
Careful we just witnessed chad here
(Little to the dumb ass Americas know) I was all a plot too bag mo bread 😂… jk… 😏
Good man 👏👏👏👍
💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
This just warms my heart ❤️
Ben Simmons lil bro should’ve settled for 2k and some neck!!!!
Great man! You're a hero.
What a fine young man who did the right thing even when no one was watching.  His mom must be so proud of him.  What a beautiful story, thank heaven for the ring doorbell.
"Don't judge a book by it's cover"
God Bless that young man
Good man
mom raised him well. such a good kid
Lmao this is better than those people doing mass shooting
A feel good story
I want to Start this Job 😅 3000 Everyday not bad!
Being from Japan, this is what happens all the time. I have never lost anything that wasn't returned to me afterwards.
He better then me bro I would have been out
Just Month Before Last, I Found an Elder Last Purse In A Shopping Cart An I Waited for Her To Call Her Phone which was also in the purse along with a few hundreds. She didn't give care to give a dollar. It kinda felt off being at the time I was homeless with my baby whom had jus gotten out the hospital. But, I'm Glad I Also Did A Good Deed. Being, If it was my Mother or Grandmother I would want the same for them.
its now at $14,500
This is great, wonderful man
God bless god loves you
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Standup guy. He has a bright future ahead
✨❤️✨
You're saving souls 👍
That boy smashed
0:08-0:10 No there’s not
A woman once put her purse in my car, thinking it was her friends because it was same make and model. I returned the purse the next day, and found out she was a stripper. I didn’t get a dime… not even a lap dance… wtf!
Japanese found wallets or  bags full of cash, will bring them to nearest police box and in days time find owners like me who have lost things ,wallets with  no ids to identifies the owner, with  money found its way to me, with police eagle-eyed investigation . Its amazing to have this news knowing the crimes like, stealing, robberies in the America. Normal occurences in🇯🇵 here. Returning forgotten stuff . Claiming it the police oat places where you last visited
“If you declare with your mouth “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved” (Romans 10:9). Now is the time to accept Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior. Obey His commands and repent of your sins because Jesus is coming back soon. Tomorrow isn’t promised.
ohhh mami I want to steal your purse and return back to you all day
God bless him.
Nah he def hit
Sweet!!!! Honesty is The Best Policy!!!!! 🙇🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙏🏻👏🏼💃🤟💋🤗🏖🏝
Great young man!
I’d rather some head in a comfortable bed than the 3k
who's aunt in this video?
A feel good story in every way
My wallet still hasnt returned yet after 4 years lol
wow!
Gooooood
He wanted her 🤣 that’s why he brought it back lol
He fine
I love it! What’s the gofundme for him? 🥰
👍👍👍👍🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 good  thing  you  do  .♥️🥰👏👏👏👏
He's smart, he knew he would get donations.
I came looking for copper, But I found gold.
Gg's my boy
Something good for a change!!!
In indian languages it's called "karma". It means what ever you do with other people either good or bad   , one day  it will return on yourself.
Good kid, we should all be more like him
HE FINEEEEEE
He’s sweet!
Integrity! ✊🏾
infinite money glitch
we need more of this on the news and social media 🔥
It's just a good person, doing good to another good person. how sweet of them to raise money for this guy.   Alot of people here is just praising the young man but the owner deserves some credit too. if it was another person they would've just not care about giving back.
I'm just glad no Karen called the cops on him!
Sooo to be clear, I should return my new purse collection? Come on man
He is my Hero🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿
We need more news like this!
plot twist he stole it and knew he would get a reward.
an angelic teenager 😘
*Good Deeds Always Do Come Around*
good kid
What's surprising about this story is not the fact that the guy was being an upstanding citizen, but the fact that this happened in California.
This shows not to judge a book by its cover. Everyone is made differently so we ought not to judge just because he or she may look different than other human beings. 📚🌻
Proud of him. As well as these women. And everyone that donated.
1 in a million situations
Do the right thing even when no one is watching. That’s biblical
he really was lookin for Eliana 👀.... bruh ain't slick lmao
Fine ass lady i would of done the same 😈
you can't really judge the people for how they look..
Awesome
He look like someone who would take something
Beautiful story 😭😭😭😭🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 what an amazing person he is 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 we always need more kindness in this world 😭😭🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽💯💯💯
Finally, something happened in US.  3k$ is such a big amount!
He’s cuteeeee!
Give that man a danm award this second 👏
I would of brought that purse back to  Eliana with love
We just ignoring how fine the purses owner is? 👀🤤
After seeing Ruben Situation this Is nice
Watching this remember the kid that returned like 50k in cash and only got 500 dollars. I know that kid ain't complaining but 3k is a lot of money for a bag being returned
0:18 ok tell me that looks like Azzyland
Alright Daygo!!!!
How wonderful!!!
My dawg became the plug 🔌 after this 🤣
did he get anything from the women or they just started asking for other people to donate but nothing from their own wallet??
"give good and good comes back to you" words people should live by
A Mexican that is honest…..why am I not surprised
He only returned it cuz he wanted to smash lol
He kinda cute tho
Bless him, he will b a great man as he grows up
Everytime I do the right thing when no one's looking nobody even cares 😂😂 that's why I choose evil now.
A perfect example of “Never judge a book by it’s cover”.
Damn they fine ash😍
Warmed my heart
He deserves the reward, there is a lot of people who would've just taken and them used whatever was in the purse.
Bad Botox
W young lad
they could’ve kept the 3k, give me 3 minutes..
Beautiful
Once I found a wallet with 400 dollars in it I returned to the owner i got 50 dollars reward. Not so happy about it but it's ok
I’m also surprised he was actually holding it. Most guys try to touch purses with the least amount of skin contact they can lol.  This was a huge deal!! A nice change from all the bad in the world.
Plot twist he stole it and she never noticed
Amazing young man! I'm very proud of his parents! Raising a damn good kid! 👍
Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Excellent soul 👍🏼
Wow this is in San Diego that’s where I live 😄
Our Father in heaven sees it ALL and im sure this awesome man knows it plus lives it out! Very beautiful soul
bro knew what the was doing
What a sweet young man!  (He’s dressed like Smokey from a Friday)
Hi
Alternative story: he staged a robbery to get a lot of money as a reward because nothing was in the purse😂
why is this such a big deal to everybody? ive done this about 4 times in my life. the last time we were at the beach and drove 45 minutes the other way onward back home to deliver it to the lady's father. had to have costco call her and she called us back. we got barely a thank you.
🥲❤️
Adrian Rodriguez was raised to do the "right thing," and got rewarded in the process.  Any young man who was raised by decent parents and brought up in scouting knows that returning lost property to the rightful owner, unmolested is the only way to return it.    Stories like these restore my faith in humanity, slowly but securely.
Awesome 💕
Good guy
That young man's parents raised him right!!! Good job mom and dad!👏🏾
it's a normal thing to do. nothing amazing or out of the ordinary but you guys make it out to be like this guy is a saint.
Look at God.  Bravo to this young man.  Well deserved!
Now there is a young man raised right. What a good guy
This is what it is to be that change you want to see in the world. I agree, always do the right thing even when no one is watching. But, there is one who IS watching and that is God who knows all and sees all. May God bless n protect this young man all his life for his goodness. There is hope for the youth of the world!😇🙏
He just wanted to hit
he's fine as hell too
Side note: this is the exception to the rule, the rule is me first, you dead last.
Amen 🙏 Hallelujah.  God has his hand on this young man.
Great young and well raised.
you can tell that woman was MOIST and amazed by this fine young man
I did a similar thing with a woman's phone and for the same reasons. I look down upon stealing from others and would want my own stuff returned to me if I ever lost something too. This young man deserves all the praise for such a act of kindness
Good manners !!  GOOD-LOOKING 💋CALL ME WHEN YOUR 18 😂
He was raised right! What a guy!
Fine young man
How staged do you want this to be?  Yes
🙏🙏🙏
He's cute I would've gave him an extra reward 😉
Can y'all even imagine how proud that mom is??? She probably dreamed about her son being this type of man while he was still in the womb. Good things coming from him!
This is the definition of “selfless act of kindness & integrity!  Never thought a 17 year old could influence me as a 42 year old!  My hat goes off to him and especially his mama
Damnn Hoodlums Out Here Doing The Right thang ! That’s right 💜💜 I say hoodlums do to an instagram profile . Iykyk
What a nice gentlemen💕
I did the same and all I was offered was a case of beer 😑
🙏
nah homie just did it cause Jefa was fine as heeeellllll
Cool, he has the same name as me!
Respect for his family who raised him as a good man🙏♥️
Very nice to hear this
He saw the picture on the ID, and wanted a "reward"
Salute brother apttmh ☮️🙏🏾🔥
3k for a honest man's gesture, I bet that changed his future for sure! Kudos to all who helped raise the funds to show gratuity for being raised right! He'll never forget the one time he did something for  some1 else's benefit for karma to come back 10 folds in his favor! What goes around does come around!🙂
Reminds me of my brothers ❤ there’s still good kids out here still ❤️🙏
And his cute take him home
Good boy. God bless him. The reward of his good behaviour was great.👏👏👏👏👏💯💯💯💯❤️❤️❤️❤️
great kid!
Yay America for having this young fella in our midst.
Good job kid! We're proud of you🌠
Ah, this is the news I like to see. Not all the negative, racist, idiotic stuff that they try so hard to promote. This is awesome.
Wow
In Tx they see a person of color he probably been shot at.
Bless his heart
Sometimes family can do anything for money mostly for social media
Y’all already know he’s gonna turn down that 3,000
Integrity, Chicks dig it.
I thought it said $3,000 dollars
I once found a purse in a shopping cart at construction store. It was clearly a woman's. Just gave it to cashier and walked out. There was probably few hundred in cash + cards but I didn't even look.
Not everybody out there just wants to take people's stuff there's a lot of people who do the right thing I'm proud of this young man
Wow what is this, good news? So refreshing and heartwarming. Please post more of it.
You just lay down a purse and forgot all about it?
👏👏earned every dollar, and ever one RESPECT!!!!
That’s a real man
This isn't productive and shows how bad off society is right now. He did what any and every human being should do if presented with this situation.  Paying people for basic common decency just leads to people expecting something for doing the right thing.  A thank you should be plenty. Credit to his mom for teaching him right and to him for going the extra mile and driving it to her when gas is near 7 bucks in Cali. Personally i wouldn't accept all that money from them.
Proud of him , but sadly this is a news story , a simple good deed such as this gets main stream media attention, what a hateful world we live in , props to the kid tho .
If I was a Big kid I will do that
Damn last time that someone drop their wallet an I gave it to them they thought I was stealing it 😂
Plot twist: he’s the one that stole it
I LOVE THIS STORY
Thank u jesus there is still good in this world🙏
Congratulations and thank you to his Mom for her teachings.
Holy face injections
Qué chingon por ti carnal! Mis respetos.
What a nice young man and a credit to his family.  He well deserves the reward and I hope it shows him that he is definitely on the right path in life.
He’s a good man n fine
Thats the kind of “influencer” we need more of.
Good Boy!!!
This is so nice
❤
Well done  his mum taught him well🇬🇧
Bro saw her ID and was like “dayum, I should slide and see this momma”
This makes Me cry in the morning!!!
Hahaha its funny how this is news in America. This is very standard behaviour in my country
Don't lose hope! The negativity that the news thrives on is not the way the whole world really is.
This is awesome!
When we grow up broke we is taught to do humble deeds
This is what we need to be talking about America👍🇺🇸🗽
Real g
You do that in gta you get a $5 reward
Yeah doing the wrong thing is easier. But real straight comes from doing the harder thing because its the right thing to do. Mad respect for him
Where's the Go Fund Me Link?
staged
Love it
there is no hope for our younger generation, this was just a rare occurrence sadly
Thank god it was on video
God bless this young man. Always do the right thing even when no one is watching. A very powerful message straight from god.
Good job brother.
Guy: here's your purse ma'am, I found it in the market Lady: k, thanks, bye!
Why does the thumbnail look like Grove Street?
My respect to you and your parents young gentleman,.
Much respect. We need more good stories like these.
That’s awesome and he is soooo fineee
Humanity strikes again! God bless him.
Integrity 🙌🏿💯 moms was totally right my guy
Good on you Adrian. God bless you
There is some good in the world yay I give that person a thumbs up for doing a good deed 👍👍👍👍👍
I’m glad there’s some people out there like that.
I had just found a wallet the other day during my ride with $1200 inside, returned it and the dude was upset I picked it up from the sidewalk, outside his house saying he went back looking for it and it was gone, not everyone is so nice
Side Quest Completed
He saw the drivers license and saw how bad she is and had to see her 😭
Bro saw the chick on the license, and hoped she’d be there
What goes around come around .  He did good in returning the bag.
Who the fk gives 105$ on Gofundme for this lmao
And thus faith in humanity has been restored
I’ve had the most remarkable luck when I dropped my keys. I went everywhere looking because I was riding my mountain bike. My neighbor the next day said he found them and had no idea who’s they were, & asked me by chance.  The next one was , I was riding my mountain bike again but on the reservation. I had a Fanny pack containing keys, wallet, cash, address book, cell phone etc… While riding a man in a white truck passed me slowly while on the dirt road. He slowly passed me as to not stir up dust. We both waved as he passed. About 5 minutes I stopped to eat lunch and found my Fanny pack was open & the contents was spilled out on the dirt road. I was frantically riding back picking up this & that, while I was beyond stressed. All the sudden I see this same white truck coming back.  This guy pulled over and said he picked up everything he could see.  In the wallet was $300.00 plus my cell phone and keys (ugh) geeze My life was in the butt bag strapped to my backpack , & to have that native gentleman not only turned around but returned my bag. But he stopped about 5 to 10 times picking up my belongings and when he stopped me and returned all of my possessions and he wouldn’t take a dime from me. I practically tackled the guy to take money and he refused $20.00 $40.00 $80.00 & finally $200.00 he wouldn’t take anything. He just said return the Jester. Someone else may need help. Wow! That’s what we all need to know. I’m not going to say how many times I’ve repaid this because it’s not about my helping those, but those who’ve helped me out of the kindness of their own hearts. God bless you my dear brothers!
WHAT A COOL GUY BLESS
I’m positive he didn’t return it for the money. Boi was a local plumber
Id like to think that a majority of people would return a lost purse/wallet. The fact that this behaviour has to be applauded is sad.
Thats right this is how it should be!
I hope he finds a good partner cuz I know for a fact his gonna treat them great.
Damnnn Nobody gives me $3000 for the good sh** that I do
Well done young man. You make me proud.
Am I the only one who sees, uhm, a possible better reward than money in this case??? 😂😂😂
Finally some good news 🔥
Good on him! And good on her for rewarding the behavior
Imagine if he stole valuables in there 😂
Well done sir.
good latinos trump
Adrian 👌🤙
Good man. There’s a sliver of hope yet.
The protagonist in those hood movies
🧢
That was a long time normal here in switzerland that you returned it or at least brought it to the lost and found office of the government.
'Tegrity.
I did this and they only gave me a slice of pizza lol
I almost became racist since i was stolen many times to Hispanic ppl. If they set example like this will change. I am rooting for those!
What a good kid. Way to go, young man! I wish the most fruitful blessings to you throughout your life.
Great kid
Great story we need the media to report on more stories like this to encourage us all in times like this instead of spreading fear and division.
Wonderful young man, great morals👍🏽
Parenting is 95 %
Wonderful!!!!! God bless him!!! Great advice from Mom!!!!
We all clicked because he looks like a hoodlum.
Finally someone did a great deed
For a young guy is age am proud of him😇I hope he continues cuz good deeds pays
i wanna mary the man
Robbers take Helpers help but does all this matter…… NO you gotta help For humanity rob for the good and steal for the poor not give for the fame    - peaky blinders
Awesome young man need more like him !
If only everyone was like that 😔
crazy, this should be normal to do..
Was that Nick Kyrgios?
I know a few boomers who would have kept the purse.  To assume because he's young, this typically wouldn't happen is disgusting.
You help for good not for fame and that’s why I never finish off and kill my Opponents    -oogway
God is good.
Foos gone wild gotta give this FOO shout out
He deserves the money.
perfect example of never judge a book by its cover. bless this young man and the family who raised him right.
Lmao boy got a good heart too bad he got no game. Tia is a baddie. xD Adrian Rodriguez you guys will never forget the name xD
Money Can make you happy temporarily but the spirit can make you joyful for eternity  - god
damn
So many beautiful people in the world 😍
I do this alot of times and I just end up with a bad day lol.   Most recent was at target the lady did not grab her money that was dispensed at the self check out and I grabbed the money chased her down and gave it to her.   After that I dropped my headphones on the floor in the parking lot and it got ran over so I had to spend $40 more dollars to get a new pair....   I could of been a jerk and kept the money and gained 40 than waste 40 but thats not how I am but still i get rewarded garbage lol.   Even if I was in his position I wouldn't have accepted her 3k reward even though I either want or need it cause my conscience won't let me do it.
Good boy
My boi hit the jackpot
A date night with the friend would have been my chosen source of payment....
<3
Pretty sure those 2 women paid that guy something better then money
This young man has morels bless him
There’s hope for her overbite
There’s 14,000 dollars raised now .. wow
Never, ever, judge by appearance.
It takes good parenting for this cause and effect
Well done kid
Thats one honest kid right there respect to the family that raised em
what's the big whoop. this should be normal. not breaking national news.
You can see the kindness in his face. You really can...
How pathetic, doing a good deed is rare now that any good deed becomes viral when it should be normal.
Jesus is God and Lord over all the universe. Whom died for the sins of the world. Repent and trust in Him. He loves us all. God bless u :)
This is the definition of Integrity.
We made the news you can give me back my money now
Bro seen her ID and thought he could of clapped if he pulled up 😂
That’s awesome! He’s go found me has raised $14k 🥳🥳❤️
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽‼️
Gj  Man   RRESPEKT  !!!!!!!!!!
Well done son and well done all who donated ✌
That is so awesome!!
I love hearing stories like this
He’s fine
What a great youngsta! With values!
Wow he deserves 4 racks for doing the right thing 😂😂😂
God bless him and his mother 🙏
The true American spirit that young man holds.
Just checked the GoFundME. It's over 15k now!!!
What in the phuck she say 1:26 ?!?!? Lmfao
I returned a purse once and the dudes gf said "where's my $100!" And he pressed me. Glad he got on tv tho
Honesty is very rewarding
First good californian
You're such an awesome young man Adrian!!
May ( GOD ) CONTINUE TO COVER THIS YOUNG MAN
Harry and Lloyd returned a briefcase across country what did they get?
I once found a womans purse and returned it.her and her husband were beyond thankful because they were taking part in a scientific study that paid very well and in the purse was a new kind of viagra and without the last bottle over 6 months of study would have been lost along with them getting paid but in the end the couple offered me half of their life time supple of the new viagra.
I did that at 16 in Daytona Beach and the woman called the Cops on me . They made her take the purse and apologize . Now ? I throw them in a garbage can i do not even bother .
Mother raised him up right. Well done for the boy still respecting n holding onto what she taught him 👏
That is why having parents in your life is really important. I’m glad his mother taught him well. Good job.
prob was nothing worthy in the purse
San Diego is a unique place, it's calm and mellow.
🤍🤍
Amazing performance
This is beautiful. I really hope this young man has many blessings.
Fantastic young man. Bravo.
Raised right
Good job parents!!
My Man !!
Wow what a great guy……brought up the right way. His mum must be so proud. Such a lovely story x
Refreshing change from the usual shooting and stabbing going on with the youth.. This young man will go far in this life.
Kids a class act.....good job Mom!!
Prayers and praise out to this young man! Gives faith back to humanity 🙏🏼
No sorry there is no hope for our generation that kid is one of a kind
Is America now so dishonest that this is newsworthy?
This is awesome.
wheres my invitation to the roundtable hold
It could of been him and I am not racist I am Hispanic to
This is amazing! 🫶🏻
Now that sure is one Dude that is brought up the right way...  Heaps of respect to his Mum... hope your proud of him Mum because the world 🌎 is 🤗
We need more gentlemen like this young man he’s a blessing
Pretty crazy doing a minor good deed such as returning a purse is worthy news material. Whats next? "Young guy holding the door for an elderly person"?
There is hope! Great job son.
Plot twist bro just was finna steal the purse
this kid deserves recognition, not the kid that shot up a 4th of july parade
People in West : there hope in our younger generation, mean while in asian, come on... we call it our culture
The sweetest <3 I'm forgetful, forgot my wallet somewhere once and a lady messaged me randomly on Facebook, said she left it with customer service lol. There's nice people out there, even little things like that means alot to someone.
This vato is honest. I bet ppl judge him just cus of how he looks. Makes me happy he got this recognition
God bless you Adrian, appearances can be deceiving!  :)
Aww he nice
he prolly looked them up on facebook and saw this as an opportunity to hook up with some milfs
He saw how good she looked on her id and thought he was finna smash sum😂
🙏❤️😇👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Bro look at the ID and said I'm tryna smash 😂
"No way a teenager did something nice that's impossible this deserves to be in the news because it is the only time a TEENAGER did something good"
I did this and the guy said “if I had any money I would give it to you”
Blah blah blah
Plot twist: he stole it and returned to get paid
You damn well know he was clapping them cheeks after
Thanks for posting positive stories and promoting good deeds. Awesome story
He was just hoping to hit that! If it was a driving license of some ugly chick then she wouldn't get that purse back
Man I was expecting the worst news has ruined me thought was going be yet another person gunned down.
The fact that we live in a world where a guy Is compensated for not stealing Is sad. It should be obvious
That's a blessing
Love n respect can heal this world ❤🙏
Well he got an audi car so he didn't really care about that purse HHAHA
Big steppa 💯💪🏽
Getting rewarded for doing the bare minimum… 😂
What a nice man
👍👍👍👍👍
He saw her and was gonna shoot his shot
Aww this made me really happy! 🥺💕
Why this never happens to me,  I return so many things and nothing not even a damn thank you
Good man
Is doing the right thing so rare these days?
Great kid and great parenting that's one hell of a Young Man. God bless him and his family
Congratulations on being a Good Samaritan beautiful story News more like should be shown on television and online, ,
That foo seen her I'd pic was like fosho ima pull up to the crib 🤣
Omg that’s amazing ! Yesterday I had just gotten off a 16 hour work day went to the store had a major toothache and fever. So I was out of it. But proceeded as I got out of my car I guess I dropped my wallet proceeded to shop because I didn’t know I lost it until I went to check out so I asked everyone did you see a wallet they said no so I checked my purse in the car and nothing looked around in my car more and nothing. Checked my work bag and nothing walked around to the drive door and there on the ground was my wallet with everything in it. I praise god for these types of things and even more people like him
Plot twist: he stole it in the first place, everything went according to plan
Good looking out homie!!!
Rare W for us teens
What a great story! Giving back is the best reward for a human
always do the right thing even when no one is watching. great words to live by well done that man
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟😘😇
meh no no cash these days,  might as well return it
much love bro. keep it up.
Nice to see some good news. Well done Adrian. Great motives too: do the right thing even when no one is watching. The gofundme is over $14k now! Sweet. Hope it helps him with whatever is next in life.
Wow great work right there!
👏 great young man! 😎
That's a good man right there
"There is hope for ouer younger generation." When I hear words like this i could puke. We didn't made the world to what it is today!
Why wouldn't you give the purse to the police?
Good kid 👍
Bro looks kinda like lil maru
That's an awesome story it's better than the other stuff you see on the news or on the Internet too bad you weren't more people like that
"If you want to be happy, set a goal that commands your thoughts, liberates your energy, and inspires your hopes."
This is very normal in my country and any muslim countries,most people will give it back to you
Legend! A good reminder to not judge someone by how they dress
Finally some positivity
Such a good kid. He was raised right.
He saw her picture on her license and wanted to meet her.  That's worth far more than what was in the purse.
Jesus said “Do to others what you would want them to do to you” so true!
nice
Nah bro saw the ID and wanted to get him some😂😂😂
17 with morals...youtube can make you either love or hate humanity
nice
Real story... Homie saw girls pic in the driver's license an got her name looked her up on social networks an was like she kinda fine. Let me return this purse to her an try to shoot my shot.  We'll never know if his shot worked out he's only 17 but my money is on it worked out.
Let's not get it twisted... he low key just wanted to meet the hot mama on the DL lol! 😄 just kidding... that is super cool I'm proud for everyone here... I believe many people would be fast to judge thus kid by his appearance... but here is proof that you can't judge a book by its cover...
Surprised he didn't get shot
Looks doesn’t define him, you can be skeptical on one hand until you find out his kind ❤️
Oh such a good boy 😭
What's his @ he's fine as hell
That one feed must have changed his life, instant trust raising!
He did GTA side quest
Anybody who was 17 between 1930 and 1992, this would be just a common practice. But now days it is very unusual for a 17 year old to return a purse or wallet to its owner, with all the money and valuables inside.
There’s hope for the younger generation? As if every other generation was perfect lmao
Or how about this for a headline. "17 y/o does common sense and returns purse."
Kid opened the wallet and saw that the purse belonged to a hot latina mom, my boy 🔥
This reminded me a LOT of the movie Greta. Even the purse is green!
Last year I found a wallet in my uber car: It had $4000 dollars in cash, a Black American Express, Nasa work Credentials ( Other things I can't write here) many other credit cards, Traveller's checks, and other very sensitive things. I didn't trust Uber to return it to them,  I didn't even tell them. I called the guy, he was beyond shocked and ecstatic, him and his wife. He wanted to give me money I said no. Then his wife suggested for my wife to make them two cakes ( My wife makes Fancy French Cakes) That was it. I was never in the news. This happens to people all the time. Not everyone is a crook like Joe Biden and his family, wall street, congress, the news people, and most people. I would feel really dirty if I kept anyone's good-earned money. Then that is just me. Not everyone is me. Then again, I am a Muslim, was born in Algeria, I am Berber Kabyle ( I am white though you cannot tell I am from Africa) and I think of death and meeting God and him asking me about the money and my deeds. Also, I noticed that each time I do something good Allah gives me more and he has never let me down. I have a very beautiful motherly Kabyle wife, a beautiful and a very smart 3 heart old ( His IQ is off the roof ), I have a small business, I mind my own business, I love the USA, and I voted for Trump ( with all his personal flaws is eons better than any democrat or republican) and will vote for him again in 2024!!! Thank you. and God Bless the USA. And death to communism!!!
Nah she was pretty he seen her pic on ID card and was like o nah I’m pulling up
Adrian is all grown up foo! Skonka did a good job to my mio
Any company would be lucky to hire someone who is honest and has integrity like this young man. Protect him at all cost!
Plot twist nothing was in there 😂
Wish people would do that for my hood deeds. Only heaven’s gate wait with presents. Well looks like we could be friends
THE GREATEST MAN EARTH        SIR
I’m so glad to hear this because right now the media is poisoning this use a whole bunch of nonsense. Strong parenting is so so needed
Such a cute and kind gesture 🥺❤️
cool glad it got recognition, bet he's going to be a successful man
Very honest young man!
Just bc she was fit lmao if it was a granny that purse would not be returned
There is hope for America! 👍🏽
I am glad they took the effort & rewarded him. My mom always taught me the same thing. "you may not get a pat on the back for doing the right thing, people may not notice. Your soul & god knows though."      That lesson I teach to my kids to this day. Do the right thing so you dont have to live with dishonesty.
Surprise he didn't record 🤣 usually the only time you see people doing things these days !!!
Plot twist he stole it from her when she wasn't paying attention
“He said” be smart.. maybe if I return it I’ll go viral and make $5000
It's sad that this is so shocking that they need to do a piece on it - but at the same time I love that he got recognition for it.   I remember finding a purse and driving all the way out to the woman after calling number in wallet. Met up and she grabbed it without even saying thanks and left.  This with credit cards, money etc. Another time this happened the woman was in tears she was so grateful. One was a concert. The other was like this, a shopping cart.
hes fine respectfully
Someone did a similar thing for me on the El Cerrito BART station. They even took a BART train in the other direction, immediately, to return my wallet (full of credit cards) to the station they THOUGHT I may have gotten on the train at. They didn’t even wait till after work to hand it over to lost and found at that station. A real Angel. I have no idea who they were but I’m forever grateful.
W man
Mom raised this kid well
thats sweet god bless him
Big hugs for that kid. 🤗
I need 5k. Please give it to me.
Respect to people like him that remain unknown without millions of views on YouTube. Tbh, when I was 17 I wouldn't have done this. Awesome job kid
He smashed when the cameras were off😂
Oh Wow THAT WAS SO NICE OF THIS YOUNG GUY SO KIND SO GENEROUS AND SO HONEST YOU SHOULD BE A LAW AND ORDER ENFORCEMENT TO PROTECT AND SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES OUR CITIES AND OUR STREETS
That boy stole that purse😂
w kid
His mom should be very proud he did a good thing and she has raised him right
I did this therr was £5 pound in it in tetbury south glis but wasnt even thanked.
If he had been a well-dressed white guy, there would be no story.
I’m pretty sure that little thug kept some money.
Wow absolutely refreshing to see. What a beautiful young man!
When Americans finally finds people not impacted by capitalism and individualism
"There's hope for our younger generation." Was there not before?
lol after he took pics of all the cards 😂
not a good deed just normal for decent people. He is one of  decent ones.
Good lad.
Bro turned in a side quest
He returned her stuff because she's hot.  100%.
I’m gunna start looking for purses at a store parking lot now.
🙏🏼❤️🇵🇭✊🏼
Foo looks atleast 30 wtf
Props to the kid for doing the right thing, Props to his parents for raising him right!
Love hearing these stories. 😊😊😊
A few months ago I saw this lady’s debit card laying in a parking lot so I took it with me and searched her name on IG and FB and I ended up finding her and gave it back to her minutes later. If I couldn’t find her I was going to call the number on the back of the card.She offered me Starbucks but I declined.
Good man
What a sweet Guy  💕✌️
DAMN THIS MAN FINE??😍😍😍😍😍😁😁😁🥰🤤😟
nah he saw the id and saw that she was 🤩
Cool young dude
1 good dead caught on camera gets this guy respect but no one actually knows his life
well done son, good always followed by good!!!!
Why can't we have more news like this? We need more news like this. Thank you for highlighting someone doing something awesome.
Nice! Thank you!
Damm wouldn't expect that
damn he fine asf 😍🤦🏾‍♂️💯
Lets be honest, he saw the drivers license and thought there was a slight chance he might get laid by this milf.
Parents is very important in a person's growth, so be a great parent to your kids. Teach them about values and how to see this world and become the change that they want to see.  Don't leave the parenting to the TV or Friends or School, become the Parent that your kids deserve.
It just goes to show you, looks can always decieve. Here's a young man, ringing someones doorbell in the late hours of night that you would think may look susspecuious, but is actually doing a good deed. THIS is what I enjoy seeing in humanity!
This is the definition of “selfless act of kindness & integrity!  Never thought a 17 year old could influence me as a 42 year old!  My hat goes off to him and especially his mama
Eliana a baddy
Young gentleman legend right there
Awesome!!
Excellent!!!
It’s people like this young man why I got faith in humanity
rewarding good behaviors is good
Right on !!!!  That is what we call GOOD MEDICINE and it will come back on you.
💗💗💗🇺🇸
his mother raised her kid right, good on her and him.
love it
I don't understand the comments on how we should not judge his looks. Like wtf? He looks like an average teenager to me. He is actually cute. And the way he dresses? What's wrong with the way he dresses? I don't understand the comments.
I'd return the purse too just to get a better look at that dime piece 😆
Crazy how we have to report good deeds in this world:(
Those shordys better have gave bro that vacuum seal gawk gawk 3k
What a good kid
More news like this !
Hell yeah Adrian
Good lad 👍👍👍
There was $15,000,000 in the purse
Good for you buddy it's great to see the younger generation keeping up the good fight
what a good kid. i wish more young kids were like this 🙌
May our Lord in Heaven keep blessing him!! ❤️❤️❤️
Stop saying we need more people like him . Be that person
Though it was my boi suede 😆
"He could've just taken whatever was in the purse, y'know. And he didn't. He brought it back and I think that just speaks a lot about him." It's a little sad that this is the way people think nowadays. Sure, it shows that Adrian is a good person with morals and would just like to be treated the way he treats others.  But it also speaks a lot about society how people expect a lost purse containing a driver's licence and probably other important documents to the owner would just be considered stolen after being lost. Anyone could be going through a really dark time without you ever knowing. Just try to bring a little light into their lives and do the right thing.
Awesome 👏🏼
❤️❤️❤️
keep it up son, and be sure to help others do the right thing too.
This what I paid my internet for
Seems staged. But hey 🤷🏾‍♂️
most realist foo we all have ever meet,ik some of my homeboys wouldnt even done that,💯💪
Now that’s a role model
i bet this whole thing is a scam just to raise money for themselves
This is the boy you want your children to be
He got some head from her true story
17 year old disguises himself as someone else and steals a purse, waits two weeks and returns the purse, receiving $3,000
I’m Japan they would have returned it wrapped!
Perfect uplifting video to get my day started
Good stuff happens all the time but that's not what we're looking out for and it's not what makes good media content.
Brilliant! But I like doing my good deeds in front of an audience so I can be showered with praise and admiration. Now like my comment.
Bruh I've done this a couple times and no reward ever🤣
❤
Plot twist: he was the one who stole the purse
"Always do the right thing even when nobody's looking" is such a beautiful message to bring our children up with. Our world needs more parents and kids to follow his actions to help BE THE CHANGE our WORLD SO DESPERATELY NEEDS. Raise up ..accountability and help one another with this better life. I'm so proud of you young man. If I was still teaching a high school class?? You would be a lesson that would indeed last a week. Then I'd fly you to our state!! NOT KIDDING either!!! God BLESS YOU young man and your precious mama who raised you right! And you chose to follow through!
Kinda sad that this stuff is celebrated when it should just be the norm.. props to bro tho fr
Atleast some humanity is alive. God bless the boy.
A heart of gold.
Viva la Raza
That's beautiful
And I love that he was dressed just they way he is. So many people would judge him by his hip-hop style. Way to go young man.
"There's hope for our younger generation." --- woman old enough to be his mother   🤔...
This also happened to me at a call center job I had. The guy who stocks drinks left the whole money bag sitting on top of the machine lol. It was full of who knows how much. I took it to the manager's office, and just handed it over and said basically "I think the guy must have left this". Then I walked out not thinking much of it, didn't even leave my name. Then like two weeks later I get called in to the office, and they say the guy wanted to reward me, so he left me a hundred bucks. They had to figure out who I was by watching surveillance camera recording
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Makes me wonder if this was some social experiment to incite reaction
Such respect. I wish there were more people that acted this way and if there is I wish the media would show it instead of the usual negative horror
His mum must be proud :)
I've had doing a good deed backfire on me..but oh well.
Karmas can go both ways⚡️
if adults took responsibility we wouldn't have such raunchy disrespectful younger gen's. I'm young and 3rd month my apartments trying to evict under fault of there own, yet my roommate "friends since highschool" i hear them go back and forth over who's fault it is..... seriously a 50+yr old is trying to WIN some arguement.... landlord had our papers in her copier and forgot them now saying we owe more. "If They T00k responsiblity for Their mistakes it would reverse our debt." That might mean more then you think.
I'm proud of this young man and I'm proud of this woman for rewarding him because he didn't have to do it but he's got to clean sane normal conscience that moved him to be human enough to do the right thing
did she say moms  haha ok
🌟ANYONE GOT THE GOFUND ME LINK🌟I want send Him some dollars on behalf of My family here in UK🌟
I got a wallet ad on this
Everyone is so shocked about our generation being normal lmao
thought it was slump6s
Good kid… you did good. You set an example for rest of the society.
She still some good people left in this leftist woke garbage world.
Plot Twist: He stole it.
Somebody does something right, and it makes the news, says enough
I honestly would of just shot a slug through the door and through his chest 🤣🤣🤣
W man
This is awesome. We need more of this. What a good kid!!!!!
He’s so fine lmaoooo 😂😭
he was just tryna hit
Nobody is gonna mention the horrendous parking by the neighbors?
Raised right😎
Thanks for a positive news story
Stunning and brave
The type of stories that deserve to go viral. Spread Positivity 🙏🏽
He fine
Why he tickle the doorbell like that tho
Solid youte mama taught him right 💪🏽🤞🏽🙏🏽🤲🏽 bih up king
Glad they got on tv with their skit, cant wait for their next piece
Its at $14,317 now. Wow. Thats amazing
Good for you son and good for you mama for raising your boy to set an excellent standard for honesty and high moral values! So proud of you!!!
biggest finesse
imagine he did check inside but there was nothing of value so he decided to give it back 🤣
I bet this is staged and fictitious!!
This is gonna do him well for jobs aswell. When you google his name this will show up 😀👍
This guy is my heroe
This is really so beautiful 🤩😍🥰
I would’ve done the right thing anyways. Nobody else does these days
I am SPEECHLESS! WOW! Great job to this young man, and KUDOS to his #1 🥇 MOM! Just an amazing story this is!
were gonna use some of our illegal immigration money, and tip this man.
：John 3:15-18 KJV❤ 15 That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life
UGH!
It's her son
This kid a great job. GOD BLESS HIM
That’s absolutely beautiful. I did that with a young lady’s wallet and drivers license I found at a grocery store. His mom taught him well. Do what’s right when no one is watching. Peace and Blessings.
Or.. this is a straight set up . She his boyfriend 😂
Good ok that young man, he will inspire mny many people
They’re mostly good.
That's what a good Mom does, raise a kid right so he does the right thing, not shoot up the place.
If you see this Adrian just know that you're a good human being and we all admire you for what you did.
😂 omg
The young homie has the makings of a real man.
He don’t look like he was hurtin otherwise prob woulda done different lol but respect either way ✊🙏
he s a prince
This foo was just trying to smash the aunt.
From her mothers orientation
He robbed it in the first place
At least some good news to report !
Some time ago, I have found a wallet with over £200 in cash. I drove to the address from the driving licence returned it and the woman just took it and closed the door, did not even say Thanks and because of that I was late to work. Maybe she thought I stole it since I was a painter and the time and my clothes were dirty. Anyway, I would still do the same thing
This is the norm in my country. Loose a purse, and you have at least a 9 in 10 chance, it will be returned. No biggie.  But nice of the kid to do the right thing, if this is not normal in the states.
May God always provide for him!
We need more people like him in our world. Good job bro
Amen I love what he was taught! Do the right thing even when someone not looking. Great morals his parents have and they pass down to their son.🕊♥️💛🙏🏼🙌🏼
Good job boy
He seen a milf and knew he had to meet her at all cost 😂
Plot twist he knew you would want to tweet/Instagram/attention about it so he stole it and gave it back
And how many people look at this kid daily and judge him because of how he dresses? Don't judge a book by its cover.
Auntys english is so fresh
With so much negativity in this world today, it's refreshing to see some positive for a change. He's gotten over $15k by the way and still going. Well deserved because his intentions were pure and simple.
How wonderful, it’s better to be honest.
He's the "Don't judge a book by its cover" personified
You heard them, go look for stuff people forgot and then act invisible until you get a thousand dollars 😂😭😭
Sometimes it’s not the way you dress it’s the way you act in public.
He found it but there was no money in it lol 😂
Meanwhile the dude is like, damn I should delete the pics of her cards…
Good Man
FAKE, he returned the purse because she had no money inside it and thought he'd get a better reward returning it. Knowing her address by snooping in her purse, he coulda gave it to the store. Just kidding lol, but could be... lol
The way life should be. If everyone just gave back!
W foo
Us men know why he returned that purse , he was imagining a different scenario going down ! 😂😂
The key factor is one of his parents, his mother, taught him something valuable. This speaks highly of his upbringing. Parents have a responsibility and schools can never replace that.
What a sad state of affairs where someone returning a purse is enough to make a video about it
Good on him, but at the same time kinda sad that this is news worthy when this should be the norm..
Now that is a great Yong man his mom raised a king
That's awesome good deal
Bro wanted to clap dont cap 🧢
He's the Real Deal Holyfield
Aww thats so cute
"Mom told me to always do the right thing, even when nobody's watching". 17yo young man living by his mothers words.   Yes, this 36yo man is crying.
Nice guy.
more stories like these please
His @ plsss
It’s nice to see good people still exist in this world
I think he wanted that number
I think it's sad how it's so shocking to see someone having a kind and selfless heart. Shouldn't this be the norm?
Imagine he does this as a living 😂 stealing and then returning items in return of cash rewards haha
one of the ladies bad af
God. Bless
My boy definitely got dat shloppy dome twisty hand combo as a reward😂
GTA gone right
Here in India i once found a Purse with a credit card & an iPhone in it. and I return it to the owner instead of rewarding me she try to blame me to be the guy who stolen her purse. I feel so upset being trying to be a good Samaritan. This is really depressing for me.💔🥺😥😡
Love this young man, I guess there still is some hope in this generation
We need more of these young generation because some of them rite now way out of hand good thing you did bro continue and you will always reach far💯💯💯💯💯💯
What an awesome young man and great parents!! Way to go Mom and Dad!! You did it, you raised a great son!!! We (USA) need so much more of this right now!!!
what   the.   5
Not me looking for lost purses.....
🔥🔥🔥
humility and respect comes along way. Way to go!
W Mans
I saw this post in San Diego a  few times. Awesome job parents 🙏🏻you raised an honorable and kind son! 🙏🏻❤️🥳
I thought he got shot for that
Good job young man. Keep it up.
bros gonna make a bag now after this vid
He deserved being rewarded. God man!
Good man❤️
Oh my god that's amazing!
It's so good to hear
Being a good parent makes all the difference.
he was tryna smash when he saw the license xD
Not taking away from what he did, because it is awesome. But, it's sad that in this world, that this is noteworthy rather than the norm.
Bueno sumeritano lol
So let me get this straight… this young man did the right thing that anyone young or old should do in returning the bag and now he’s being handed $4k??  Sorry but that’s actually dumb.
I remember when I found someone wallet I found the lady and returned her wallet. She said she had $200 in the wallet and it’s missing. I told her I returned it to her just how I found it and no one went in it. She said she will call the cops on me if I don’t give her the $200. I told her to call the cops I will wait for them. She end up just yelling at me and driving away. Lol 😂
Absolutely brilliant story there is hope
We don't need people like him We need to be like them.
Love this video
"Man does basic but appreciated good service, everybody loses their mind'  Like dude all power to this guy, especially a 17 year old needs every cent they can get in this day and age but did you really need to give him a questionnaire on why he did it, is "it's not mine, it's morally correct to return it if possible" really that much of a surprise?
Thank you Jesus.❤️
"Always do the right thing, even when nobody is looking."
List the fundraising page n see what happens.. GOD works in wonderful ways.. 3000 to 3 million.. xxx top lad xxx great mom xxx Godbless ❤🤟
My man 👍🏻
“I found your purse foo.”
This is such a good story 😁❤️
He was hopin a baddie would open the door
Plot twist. He stole the purse. Saw nothing in it, wanted to scope out the address to rob it, and they handed the money over anyway
Never judge a book by its cover ladies and gentlemen
Plot twist he was tryna smash a cougar
He looked at her ID and simped his way to money rather than some 🐈.
He saw her passport, and decided to give it a shot lol
Not all hero’s wear capes
Plot twist he was the one who stole it and decided that he would get more money by returning it rather than pawning it off
"Random person is decent person!"
Bro look like eminem
She really said there is hope for the younger generation 💀
what!! and he his pants were sagging???...see this is why we say..don't judge a book by its cover..it could be gold pages inside..Bravo!
A good young man that would otherwise be judged in 96% of settings just based on looks! Always remember to never judge a book by the cover!
It's rare to see it nowadays but what she said is absolutely true!  There is hope for us yet maybe!
Everyone finna raise their kids right in hopes of getting $3k
Honestly her face looks like 20k right there I think keeping the bag would be better it wouldn’t go to waiste💀
Oof
🤘😎🤘🇬🇧 Well done that young Gentleman 👍👍
Outstanding young man!!  Beautiful ❤️
That's the secret to a better society. Good parenting. If everybody instills good values and principles in their children the world will change.
Plot twist, he stole it and his conscience got the better of him.
3k for gaming PC right there, his set for life..
He seen the photo and was like let me bring this over, 😂 😂
Easy to return what you steal
this video mocks all the black/hispanic teenagers - like they would be unreliable by default
It’s not that we need more people like him instead we need everyone to be like him.
What did these two women do with the extra 750?
I know he did this because it was the right thing to do but I'm glad he got a reward that he was not expecting.  His mum should be very proud of the young man she raised.
It's not about the Good Samaritan it's about the good recipient I have returned to Lost wallets and things to people at their house and they have never started a fundraiser for me
We need more people like him to do the right thing
My mom lost her laptop and this guy brought it to the house so I gave him $25 but best believe if I had it like that I’d have given him $3000
Thats my dogg!!!!🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼
Sketchy asf I wouldn’t trust because A WHOLE LOT OF criminals, take yo chances. Her girl is cute asf though js lol
Fake story, the guy is actually a friend of that lady's son smh
karma :)
The younger generation? U found the one in 1000 that would do thiis
So the only way to encourage change in the world is thru incentivizing
aye bruh can someone drop they purse for me ? i’m tryna buy a pc bro 1k is good enough
Money corrupts
Wow, my wife and I once found a wallet with over $1000 in cash at the Great Escape amusementpark near Lake George in NY ... we looked up the person on Facebook using the ID found in the wallet and posted a message on his messenger...we then actually saw him walking by us and recognized him based on his Facebook pictures... he had never even seen our message nor had he realized his wallet was missing...gave it back and the first reaction from what I guess was his girlfriend was "is it all there?" ... not even an enthusiastic thank you
Just because he's Latino and dresses a type of way y'all expected him to do the wrong thing, if it was a white kid dressed casual y'all wouldn't make this a huge deal.
It’s the Right thing to do. Good kid!💯💯🤙
wow, there is hope for our future
That was one scary video. To see someone being rewarded 3k for a purse...      Oh no 😳
defo just seen the pic on the ID and thought he was gonna smash 🤣
a MILFy woman, a young dude and he got $3K. oh, he made that lady really happy.
Good to see we still have honest people. I’d deny the 3k award though. Don’t need a Pat on the back every time you do something nice.
A real man in the making
nicest person in california
Wow look at the good deed and the reward for it. No stealing no mugging honesty and a reward for it. If only everyone had this mindset
The results of a good education from parents.
That’s dope love it
Great advice from his mom and a great young man!
Nice
What a classy lady , also she got  awesome smile  !!
Only a few people today got manners
This dude is more gangster than al the gangsters
Period 🐌
Ay I’m from San Diego too 😂
He looks expressionless and I’m jealous people can compose themselves so calmly 😂  Edit: He’s cool this is no way a diss
Twist; he stole the purse and wanted the reward
He saw that I.d picture and wanted to see if he could clap it lol
Good job Mom & Dad, you done good! Good job young man for holding on to the good values you were taught.
He deserves head🤣🤣🤣
Can't believe this guy died yesterday in a drive by. You never know when your time is up. 🙏
Rewarding for what should already have been done 🫠..
how does the guy know where they live ...
I’m just happy to finally see somebody doing good on the news. It’s like ww only see the bad stuff people do
he probably stole it and returned it 🤣
We need more people like this young man, well done
🥹🥹
hope for our younger generation? Like hers was perfect lmao
i just hope that one day this will become a normal thing and it wouldn’t be news anymore
what a good guy!!!!
🔥🔥🔥
Very nice video!
Good thing he got rewarded. That lady didn't even give him anything at first. Wow
He did it cus she lowkey bad , since nobody else was gone say it 🌚
The GoFundMe is over $14,000 now.
Bro definitely brought it back cause the lady on the license was bad
Integrity is in short supply these days. Nice to see this.
That’s how you secure the bagg for la mamalona
He's a fine young man, and his mother raised him well.. thanks to both of them 🌷
Wow… so encouraging 💕… all hope isn’t lost
What would the world be if everyone was honest like this young man?
Staged 😂
When you realise that this is a regular everyday normal thing in every muslim country.
Such an honest young man, and my respects to that great mother.
Love that!
This kid is a boss. I hope he keeps building positivity in his life. Positive movement!
Boy be like- this is business
❤🥰❤🥰❤🥰❤🥰❤🥰❤
shii i would’ve just took it
he seen the hermes bagg lol
Well done my guy
I got a 50p reward once had to share between 3 of us. Got 5 tiptops with it.
good job!
he was just looking to smash afteer seeing she werent an ugly thing simple as that
“Fine young man” what 😭
We need more people like him 🤍🙏🏽
found a purse in a shopping kart bring the purse to the women that call her cellphone the when i land her the purse she simply slam her door to my face no thank you or anything WTF Ontario Canada😡
Omg!! I love this. And he such a handsome young man 🙏🏾
Alright young buck good stufff
That shows he has good parents (or just parent idk) and was raised well. Hopefully continue to do good things. Unlike most of the generation Z subhumans. Unfortunately MY generation. But makes me happy to see more good people
America must be in a really bad state for this to be news.
this made my day
He saw the picture on the ID and said this is better than hitting up the DMs
he gave a purse and got $3k??? I am never taking anything that's not mine ever again
he saw how hot she is on her drivers licence that's why he wanted to bring it back lmao
This doesn’t need to be a whole news block 💀💀
Good job young man! Good job!
He's a stand up guy 🙏🏿🏁💯.
That's a Birkin bag.
Wow god bless him that was really nice
shouldve rewarded the young buck a different way
That’s some bullshii
Was there something in the bag that had great value or the bag meant alot to her
dam eliana bad asffff
Good job young man 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
cool friend!
Aww that’s so awesome
Yo she is a cutie 😍 if homie was a little bit older, he might have gotten a phone number and date lol.
His mom rise home well.... good job mom.
Now if he could just learn to wear pants that actually fit .
GOD BLESS HIM REAL MEN DO REAL THINGS 🙏🙏
.
To all the parents out there, please tell your kids not to do this kind of thing. The kid could be shot going up to a stranger's door, or he could be arrested as a drug smuggler if the purse were full of illegal drugs.  Tell your kids to hand the purse to the store or a policeman, or taking it to a police station.
One look at her driver's license, I'd be returning that purse too.  JK,  good-job friend.
the lesbians couldn't reward him differently...
1. Steal a purse 2. Return the purse 3. profit  (1.5. -> Actually remove money from the purse as an insurance)
I love how this is news in America :D In my country that would be completely normal.
This is awesome but I wish it was the norm
Awesome!!!
I love positivity
Should have invited him in for a 3 sum, it’s the least they could have done
Love, love, love this.  God bless him 💜
Dan Dan Dannnn!
W human
Fake they just wanted to make 15 mins of fame
Is that rare in states?
99% you get nothing if you bring something back to people, sometimes not even a thank you. He is the 1% who got rewarded... from others.
I’d defo go drop it bye if I saw her diving license in purse 😍😅 I bet them women did have a surprise for him haha
I remember when I brought a camera I found near my grandma’s apartment building to the station. The cops just laughed at me when I was filing the report that someone lost the item etc. they told me that I should have taken it for myself because now they’ll have extra work.
sheesh doing a good deed just not make you rich it also makes you rich in love
Plot twist: He’s the one who stole it and felt bad for it🤣
W man
Feel good video.
"there is hope for our younger generation" like your all holy and amazingly "good" generation was all that better :))
Hi
He looks more like someone who would steal purses tho💀
Guy steals a purse and redelivers it for the reward money. Thats a sweet a scam.
I would have just settled for a 3 sum lol
if social media and tv news would show that type of news more than mass massacre and onslaught, the world would seem much much different place
I love this
Good kid!  Gives me hope for that generation…
Ok
Does anyone know how we can donate to this young King??
Love your neighbors as you love yourself. I believed this came from a book i dont know which one.
Damn bro, I can see why he returned it 💀
I returned a purse to a woman that I saw walk into Walmart who had left her purse on the roof of her car….she freaked out and called 911 while checking the contents of her purse while looking at me like I violated her….never again.
imagine trying to be nice and get suspected of stealing their money
imagine trying to be nice and get suspected of stealing their money
That's why you need to educate your children
He gives hope that this world isn't all bad. Glad he made it to his destination, had the wrong cop intercepted him he would have been profiled, shot and the evidence of someone's purse would be case closed.
That's a well raised young man. The purse didn't suit him anyway 🤭
Bro seen that ID on the Latina and said lemme slide i could prolly tap that😂😂
Glad to see there’s still some good people in 2022
If she wasn't hot and Latino or whatever she is he would have ran off with that purse 👛👛👛👛
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
I’m always hearing good things and about good people in SD
I never noticed his looks just a good person doing a good thing!
This is nice of course, however I just watched a video 5 mins ago, where a guy in Japan drops his wallet 50 times as an experiment and it was returned 50 times to him.... :)
That JI ?
it would be better if the money came out of their pockets not from the people
I honestly can’t stop thanking Dr Igudia on YouTube who cured my herpes simplex virus completely with his natural herbs which I ordered from him. Thank you so much Dr Igudia
But why did she have her friends driver’s license? 😳
Good on you young man! Keep that attitude in life. You'll go far
Im not used to see sweet hearted gringos on social media 👏🏻👍
You know he puertorican💪
Because of his good thoughtful sensitive act, that guy just turned 1000+++ times more handsome too. Total debonair 😝
Now that's a good samaritan you don't find too many people like that
Good man!👍
Love this respect ✊🏽
PRAISE GOD!!! There IS HOPE for our younger generation!!! What an amazing young man, obviously raised by 2 very special and wise parents!
I dont want to be the bad guy here but how sad it is Someone doing right thing becomes news...
Broe heading right to the plug w that money
This guy is more of a G for bringing this to the right Owner. Keep up the good work my man!
i bet i wouldn get a reward
Smart he knew it was a rich area 🤣
I'm so thankful that the country i live in has so many people like these. I once dropped my purse which had money and all the cards and important stuff right before entering the car. I reversed my car and reached the gate of the hospital i was leaving when i heard someone hitting my car (with their hand) from the back. I looked back and saw a man panting and holding my purse😭😭 I felt soo thankful that he ran all the way towards my car just to give me my purse back which wouldn't give him any benefit. I've forgotten my things so many times but never once it got stolen thank God. I'll always try my best to do the same to everyone else because i know how much these things mean to someone even if it might look like the smallest thing that no one might care about.
Broe pulled them pants up quick
He just played yall so hard 🤣🤣💀
Nice kid. Gotta be careful, though, some will use something like this as a way to rob you at your house, or worse. Don’t be naïve.
Love stories like this
If you lose a wallet or purse go to the grocery store and ask. I used to work at one and I found dozens of them. A lot of people don't ever ask and we hold onto them indefinitely.
Good lad, probably could have sold the bag for $4k
Naaah now this is a lick.
We need a million of him
Good job little brother.......be a part of the solution and not the problem 👍
He probably stole it and brought it back for that fraud reward
Some good news, how refeeshing!!
when i was a late teenager my friend and I were walking to 7-11 late at night and found a woman's purse on the side of the road. we looked at her ID, and she didnt live far so we walked a few blocks to her house and put the purse in her mailbox because it was so late.
Good kid
those PLASTIC LIPS 🤣
Be the change you want in the world 💯✊
This reminds me of the time I found a wallet lying in the field behind the Whitby City Hall. I took it home, tried to find out the name of the person using the Internet, but didn't know what to do. I eventually called the police, and conversed with them. One thing led to another, and they opted to come, take the wallet, and return it to the proper owner.   While there, I gave the black cop some advice to tell the owner. There's a built-in hole in the wallet for a string to go through, so buy a black shoestring, and use it to secure it to your belt so you'll never lose it again. While I didn't get any reward, I just don't care. I wanted to give the person their wallet they lost, and the police were helpful.   Thank you Durham Regional Police Service.
If a young guy came to my door saying he found my aunt's purse, I would think it's a hoax to get me to open the door and I probably wouldn't have.😭 It's sad,  because an act of genuine kindness nowadays is much rarer than a scheme.
I’d wouldn’t give it back lol
hope for humanity. Good kid :)
Man did a side quest
This is great
Idk why the news doesn’t post more stuff like this. We all clicked on this looking to smile. Found on YouTube.
Wonderful!!
Women never lost her purse always had with them it's not important thîng it's everything to all women's so.if she lost her purse then she's upto something even more important 😜
W mans
That young man has a good heart
Great story.  Awesome that he returned the purse.  Kudos to him and his parents for bringing him up right.  I shared this story.
W
Integrity!!
way to go Adrian!
Awesome job young man.
Is that j.i the price of new york 💀💀💀
He just wanted to tap those asses. I would.
Nice
I think I know the real reason that man returned the purse he saw her picture on the ID lol she’s sexy
finnally the media puts out a good story and does not just go out of the way to find the bad.
That purse color is amazing
Is mother taught him well , Good dude
The expectations coming from this…. Teens will get a thank you or maybe $10 when they return a lost wallet and instantly turn criminal for the rest of their life out of disappointment
Why'd you return the purse?  Coz I saw her picture and she looked hot.
Give your life to the One who loves you most, Your Heavenly Father. Don't let the lies of the world keep you bound. There's nothing you can't come back from, absolutely nothing.
do unto others as you would want done unto you.. way to go! this is touching.
the kindness you put out of the world always has a way of coming back to you
Very good his mom sounds abit like my mom lol but great job young man it brings joy to me to see this in 2022
❤️❤️❤️
Salute to the young man ,,,,
such a nice young man
He just wanted to clap the friend lmao
Why does he look like ben simmons tho?
God why can some people be like this
Truth
Finally some good news
I usually skip this bit
Should have gave him the kitty 😍
His mom must be sooooooo proud of him
Plot twist: he is the one who stole it
Fake staged story for clout nothing more.... Next.....
Top man, it would have only been a short term gain if any, you absolutely did the right thing.
Way to go
he said his mom raised him that way. PARENTS PAY ATTENTION
Good deed. Good Karma.
the way a man doing a good deed is shown on TV as if it’s a miracle or something. what a cruel world.
good
this is amazing but dont see this and think you will alsop get 3k for a good deed, you should do the right thing with no other motive than it is what is right, just like this kid did
Oh my goodness! How awesome is that? A 17 year old who actually listened to his parents. Now I want to find his GoFundMe. Wow, that was so wonderful
That’s Krukone😂
Great job young man. Future leader in the making. Good decision making will take you far in life especially having morals lil bro 💯
That a nice kid I lost my wallet 3 time with my badge and I’d it time someone returned it. I been lucky and this is Philadelphia 3 times
I was in this exact situation a few years ago. A purse was left in a shopping cart in the parking lot. I grabbed it, opened the wallet only to get an address from the drivers license to return the purse. I drove to the house, returned the purse & the lady didn't even say thank you! She grabbed her purse & shut the door. Mind you, that wallet had every credit card you can think of, I can't even imagine the damage if the wrong person had found it!
It's a huge relief to know that we can still trust in humankind.
The chances of someone doing a good deed and the house just happening to have a camera to film it? Suspicious. Most people I’m pretty sure don’t have a camera at their door. How convenient.
Big ups to Adrian ✊🏼
Thank you for sharing this story. There is so much bad news going around it’s tragic. Seeing/hearing stories of pure good brings hope and cheer to many people. Thanks again!
The hell with the purse he's a cutie
Let's be honest. The boy saw the driver's license and thought he would let laid by a hot cougar.  (just kidding)
lil man saw the ID lmfaoooo
W
smash
How does a female leave her pocketbook in a shopping carts wow? It’s like a man leaving his phone behind 😂
We all know who that looks like 🤣  J.I
I wish all youth is like him. Godbless you young man 🙏🏻
At a boy! Be the change brother 💯
thumbnail looks like gta 5 4k gameplay
yeaaaaa I'm proud of him!
Yum he can be the father of our child, impregnate me onegai!!!
Hi
That’s what I’m talking about good karma for good deeds
It’s at $14179 !!! Wow
I love how they described that he was kind of at a loss for words when he was asked why he returned it like it’s just normal for him to do the right thing so he had to think about it lol. Very nice to see!
Love this
god bless him
The guy will be the MC in the gangster world.
Bless him, his mother gave him the best advice, do the right thing when no one is watching!
his fine
Shout out to him for doing the right thing.
Is he black?
How sweet
correction its 10k not 3k
9 times out of 10 if someone’s finds your stuff the money will be missing
Personally I would’ve taken it..jus me personally doe
Good 👍 citizen....   We need more kids like this in this generation would be a better world.
So great to see it
Quá tuyệt vời ....
Why do people get rewarded for doing normal things
link the gofundme to this video
Wonder how much money 7.4 million views earned inside edition? You think they gave the money to the boy? ....yeah ofcourse not.
Probably took a look at her license picture and was tryna smash
Hope? It's called common decency
We need more teenager like this, instead of being woke mob.
The sad thing is that doing the right thing is so rare that when someone does it, it's on every news channel
This stinks of a go fund me scam
My name is Adrian too
pfft please if she'd lost her purse It wouldn't of matter cause look at her, shes had so much plastic surgery
God bless that young man’s heart ❤️
Good to see we still have honest people in this crazy ass world 💪🏾
More of this! ❤️
The younger people of today do not like to work especially if it's labor intensive
Nice guy!!! X
I'm dreaming I want him to be my husband like him🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰☺️
There's no hope for our youth
Looks like all the vatos I know; respectfully honorable. Don’t judge a book by its cover. And don’t mistake his kindness for weakness.
lucky wasnt a nut maybe he be back. usa not safe
That's how u do it my boi
Handsome too.
These young kids now days dress like thugs when they're not, when I was growing up if you dressed like that if meant you were in a gang.
My hope in humanity: 📈
wow
Awesome
Thank you, Adrian!! <3
dud was tryna hit
w guy
New king of "wholesome" narcissism
This is a direct result of good parenting. His parents should be proud to have raised such a good, honest young man.
See this young man proves that there is still good in the world
I lost my tablet worth $500. i thought I had lost all the stuff on my tab because $500 is a lot of money in indian rupees. i got scolded by my parents for being so irresponsible and I cried that night to sleep. the next morning a guy calls me using one of the emergency numbers on tablet to return it, I was so relieved to get it back. that man was a angel. bless these good souls 🙌
He saw the driving license he was bound to come and find her 🤣🤣🤣
:) nice
Insider can do good stories why can't regular news do it Then you wonder why guys called you guys fake news Because you guys always want upset in turmoil instead of reporting on good news good job insider needs to be more stories like this instead where's like this I studied just didn't blue
It’s the fact that he doesn’t post him self on Instagram or Snapchat showing thays he retuning it. Great individual and amazing parenting !
Glad to see young folks doing the right thing! Gives us hope.
Doesnt matter if you don't get a reward. Doing something good gives you the biggest buzz.
That’s amazing
Hopefully they both topped him up for this
Great work young man
Please. I've found a stuffed Louis Vuitton backpack on the airport and guarded it waited for staff to come pick it up after I called the front and told them. It was stuffed. Didn't even look inside.
Good jobs.. u make yr Parents Proud 👍
AWESOME YOUNG MAN!
still a few good people in the world . Hallelujah Praise God!!!
👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
Plot Twist: There wasn’t no money inna purse🤣😂
"Young latino guy gets what he deserves"... Yup I like this title :P
I was taught the same thing, found a big fat wallet loaded with money on the counter at the post office and without a second thought, turned it in to the clerk, who didn’t say a word but just ‘ho-hum’ took it and dumped it into a bin. I didn’t expect a reward nor recognition, but every good deed shouldn’t go undone or unappreciated, which is what I believe also discourages people in being true and honest. I’m in debt, that reason alone the money I could’ve taken it, but I knew for myself returning it is the right thing to do... in turn, I’d would like someone to do the same for me one day. In honor of what my parents and elders have taught me, I’ll continue to do the right thing. ❤️👍🏼
❤️❤️❤️
Such an American response to publicize this despite him most likely spending it on drugs.  Assumption?  Yes.  Statistics?  It’s fact.
Love it.
Wonderful to hear something positive like this well done young man
Eliana Martin looks sorta like Azzyland
That's kind on both ends. Anytime I've ever lost something important (wallet, 2 cell phones and passport), the person always just kept it. Correction, the person who found my wallet returned my Green card (super important back then) and my license, but kept the $400 and ALL of the pictures. I was so grateful to have my green card back that I didn't fret too much about losing all the money my dad had just given me to return to campus after the Christmas break, but the pictures from family and friends with personal notes, that was heart breaking.
I hate/love how being nice is so uncommon that when it happens we feel the need to pay for it. Kid prolly didn't care he just wanted you to have your bag back
Those Chicas making me loco
What kind of face is it? of her friend?
He was Tryna slide in that cat
Now i know why he returned it I would of too 😏
GOOD MAN, GOD BLESS HIM.
This is beautiful. Be the change you want to see in the world. If someone does a good deed for you, pay it forward.
Nice
Anybody mentioning "judging from looks" obviously judging from looks.
This exact situation happened to me. I forgot my purse in a cart after a very long day at work (worked overtime that day). I was exhausted but had to get some groceries that day. So when hubby picked me up, I had him load everything in to the car while I sat down. He thought I had my purse, I thought he'd put it in the trunk. Panic set in the moment I got home and realized and we raced back to the store. But no one had turned it in. I assumed it was gone forever, but some kind person found it and brought it to my apartment building and gave it to our superintendent while we were racing back to the store. I have no idea who is was and the Super didn't get their name or address. Everything was still inside. Bless them.  This was many years ago now.
It's true. Always do the right thing, even when no one is looking
good person
Can we have MOREEE ppl like this young guy PLEASEEEE!🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻👏🏻 FINALLY someone "kind"  and "real"  left in the world, aint many like him 💕💕
Wow and I don't even thank you for doing these kind of things
Exactly right! Good job.  When mama says "Creator is always watching" those words stay. I had three temptations finding money at different occasions in my lifetime, once with my daughter, I passed that on to her "Creator is always watching" I always made sure the money was returned to the rightful owner! This young man reminded me of those occasions! I showed my family this clip and gave me goosebumps! Thank you for the reminder. God bless you sir!
that's wassup I probably would took the money in the purse and returned it
I would hire him and teach him to tattoo !!!! We need this type of human in all our life’s !!!!
What a good young man. That's great.
When I was 14 When I found a wallet and in it had $700. I took it to my mum to help me return it. When I did he was so grateful he gave me $50.  My mum told me not to take it. When I asked why she said because doing a good thing should be enough.
Do not use this school!! Giant rip off!! Took my money and never followed through on promises made.
Bad thinks usually happen to good people, nice to see things the other way around for a change...
Posutive traid
Salute to him!!!! ✊🏾💯🙏🏾😇
Ok Carti B
Great boy..well done..
Adrian wya?? Did you receive the money??
Most people would have returned the purse.
i prefer 3k and one special awesome night with her :))
Hope for American Society....
Well it's still a few good guys left not nobody that nice...
I’m here thinking she looked fine in her I’d photo and maybe he thought he would get a lucky ending 🤷🏽 that’s what I would’ve thought as a teenager lmao
Quit playing that's her son
That is sooo sweet good job young man you did the right thing
Stupiiid
So he returned a purse, got good clout for his rep, nearly 4K and two milfs talking about how good of a person he is. Nice guys win, don’t let the movies fool ya.
yea I woulda stolen the money
AWESOME!!!
Honestly ? I think it's fake. With my friends, I could make the same footage. But nobody would care obviously 😂
What’s the woman on the rights @
Bravo - but yet it’s kind of sad that we live in a world where we feel it necessary to reward someone hugely for doing what should be the norm.
I did this and all I got was a grunt...
Awesome young man . We need more teens just like him .
Perfect example of never judge a book by its cover. Good for you bro 👍
His is a staged event. This was orchestrated. By the footage expressions, lighting…  The Dems strike again. Those of us that have IQ’s above 130 see through the staged event.
Bro saw her ID and went had to find her
One time I found a wallet outside a parking lot at a mall. Long story short, I had a feeling the guy was gonna come back looking for it, so I waited in my car and gave it back to the guy. He even decided to reward me $10 (definitely helped with laundry money lol). I wasn't expecting anything in return, but was glad to have given something back. As I would like to have the same be done to me.
Got more than that burger kind employee lmao
That young man's mom should be super proud of her son!
Aww beautiful story. Gives me hope for the future generation. What a great young man. His Mom did a great job. Go Mom!! She did a great job raising that young man god bless.🙏🏼❤️🙏🏼❤️
Thats how media covers it. Truth is prolly this.  There was no money in the Purse. He saw her picture. Shes hot. Imma bring her her purse maybe i get some p
$20 bucks.. Leave it to a latino to be cheap af! LOL! All your stuff in that one purse and i am sure it would have cost more to get everything back plus the trouble. at least $400 bucks... The cost of what you would have spent for all the paperwork...
Please girls, lose your purses.
Who is here from Brandon?
My husband returned a lady’s purse, and she was so happy. She said she had just cashed her tax return and was freaking out. She too was surprised everything was still in it. He didn’t get a reward, but it’s ok, he said he felt good just doing the right thing.
Good for him! He’s not even my kid, and I’m proud of him!
He used it buy a half pound of weed and since has flipped that into a self sustaining marijuana business with the occasional offering of Acid and Molly.
Atta boy Rodriguez 🥹
This kid was raised right ✊🏻
Well done that man👍
💯🤍💯🤍💯🤍💯
le plus fou c'est qu'on en parle aujourd'hui comme quelque chose d'extraordinaire alors que c'est tout bonnement normal.. ça me rend triste
I think when he saw those duck lips on the license he be thinking potential alternative means of reward.
GIVE BRO THE  TOP
Good boy 😊
God bless this young man , one in a billion. Somebody over paid me one time , By the end of tbe day they had the money back. The man was in his mid 70's. That could have been money for medicine or food.
It's crazy how we live in a world where doing the right thing needs to get all this attention smh
That's called being "raised right."
Rodrigo will always me that all hope is not lost on our youths.
His mom raised him very well..
Amazing. There’s hope in this world 🙏🏽💯
Anime logic 🗿👁️👄👁️
Everybody keeps saying, "There should be more people like him." No, we should be like him. Do a good deed even if nobody's looking.
2 lesbians,great!
✊🏿
Oh... for once the saying "No good deed goes unpunished" is actually wrong??
Great kid, s/o to his mother
W
If you've ever been given something back you lost. Its you're duty to pass the good feeling on to someone else if you have the chance.
I only Write a comment because than its the 15.000th comment
Thank you to all who donated where you can for excelling people doing the right thing.
Straight grown' man sobbing. This is what we need more of. Not more "If you didn't vote for Biden, you ain't black"  Kill the P.C. and raise some top humans.
hi🙋❤❤
Theres always a white sheep among blacks and and a black sheep among white, it's just how life is for humans.
👏👏👏👏👏👏
Deffo wouldn’t get that from a BLM
I thought it is A GTA San Andreas walkthrough 😹😹😹
Lets be honest, he probably saw her photo on the drivers license and thought DAMN! better return this ;))
people gonna start stealing purses and bringing them back for reward money.
Parents raised a good kid!!
Well let's just say, this kid is a much better person than me.
Fake 🤣
Love it...I lost a wallet once and it was returned as well..mind you my friends gave me money to pass for the week! Had lost my paycheck..id's.
Eliana Martin looks like the kind of person who would leave their purse in the cart.
GOD BLESS this young man
He got the drip
If always loved that quote about doing the right thing even when nobody is watching!! Good for this teenager, good karma definitely came his way. 💗💗
Fine a.f
It terrifies me that doing the decent human thing is so excessively rewarded
Parents raise a very good young Man,should be very proud
Im sure he got more than cash 😬😏
It's nice and good to see, you don't get many young ones these days going out their way and  return someone's property, he's been brought up good 👍💯
Bruh This guy doesn't look like 17 to me
Restores my faith in humanity,not everyone is dishonest,this is fantastic.
Yep it speaks alot about him.
He's nice and fine asf
He saw the ID and wanted the digits
good kid .....make me happy
Plot TwIst: 3 of them work together, and now they have raised over 3k for themselves.
It’s called ‘ integrity’ . As the young woman said , “What you do when no one’s looking.” Bravo.
Oof, gofundme. He'll only get like $3 of that $3000.
Plot twist:if it was planned
"There's hope for our younger generation". Just because the media depict youths as these people who don't care about anything, doesn't make it true.
simp
Good man.. 👍👍👍👍👍
Good s#!t Adrian. Stay true. 💯❤🙏
what’s his socials
In this world full of bronze person like this is gold.
PROVERBS 22 : 6 'TRAIN A CHILD IN THE WAY HE SHOULD GO, AND WHEN HE IS OLD HE WILL NOT TURN FROM IT'☝️🙏😇 I PRAY THAT ALL THE CHILDREN LIKE THIS.🙏
mama thought him right
This guy is more trustworthy than most American politicians. Make him your Secretary of the Treasury
with his 3k reward, i hope he buys a proper belt...other than that good job young man!
U hear about the dude that handed 134k in and the dude reward was 500 dollars lol
Vote no on prop 27
The thumbnail looks like Grove street in the background .And CJ himself came to return the purse.
Damn, tell the lady with the dark hair she has a husband waiting in the UK if she ever wants to relocate 😂🥵
karma does come back. twice ive returned valuable items ive found to their rightful owners........and twice ive lost valuable items and have had them returned to me. it truly does feel good to do the right thing.
The fact that he looka exactly like someone who would rather steal it makes this even better
i just got chills watching this :)
Well done that man!
I believe in good karma. My daughter recently left her iPhone in the mall and it was handed over to the customer service which she was able to collect. Years ago she also found 2 iPhones at  different times at the bathroom mall and took them to the customer service where the rightful owners was able to claim it. I myself found an iPhone  in a bathroom mall which the owner got it back.✌🏼❤️
Yeah right...the purse was "lost"
This is encouraging and impressive to see this young man do this in this day and time. People need to strive to be like this young man. Very heartwarming 💕🌄
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH i hate americans approach to this kind of thing, its called honesty, it doesnt deserve a reward or a f'ing news article about it.
Absolutely beautiful women good job dude
The tittle says 3K but he got 1K yall clickbate liars!
it's nice to see people doing good things in once and a while
Well done son.
It looks like a Berkin bag worth like 10k
Great job young man
Women love honesty in a man what can you say🤷🏻‍♂️
Good lad, well brought up. Always do the right thing, even when no one is watching is right !
Her being pretty may have something to do with it
Nice Young man  everybody should be like that.✌🏾🙏🏾
Awesome guy.
The GoFundMe already passed the 14.000$ mark. Amazing!
Thats a great kid, his Mom raised him right.
Only reason he came back was because he could see on the id she was a milf
You know we live in a messed up world when An act of decency is celebrated as a miracle
What a great guy, we need more like him and the reward is well deserved.
Well raised young gentleman
Over 14k and growing now.
only place in the world where this is actual news: America land of the "free"
He's a good guy
His Mom taught him well
If all people could be like this there would'nt be so many damn problems in the world.
Good young man.
Decency prevails ! How refreshing .
Yeeee
He is a tremendous human being
whatnot that my boy joe
Noble deed indeed!
Shout out parents shout out young man shout out inside edition for the coverage
a few months ago found a wallet, saw 2 girls walking off in the distance. i sprinted up to them and checked if their faces matched the id in the wallet.  They got all their stuff back.
Good bloke
We want more of this kind of person. Just a good parenting 😊😇
3 grand to cover the gas
You know the world is sad when doing the right thing is awe-inspiring.
And teenager just happened to be Latino aswell
Once you strip away your ego, selfishness and political views, you become what is good, just and beautiful in the world.
One in a million person like this don’t exist on the earth these day god bless young men
I once returned 100 euro to the bank and the lady thought my dad did it so I got 2 bottles of whine as a thank you xD So I gave them to my granny :)
She couldn’t throw him a piece shame
I would do the same thing but for a different reason... I'm too lazy to explain my reason so I'll just say it in 3 words: Dead / Homeless / Bottomless 🤣🤣🤣
Do you drive at 17?
I returned a lost wallet. Without pilfering it, of course. I didn't ANY reward.🤷‍♂️😕
Can't understand you
I don’t ffcffmmndddddnndn
Plot twist: they keep the money of the fundraising because they haven’t been taught to do good things
This foo was raised right.. Love to see this.
This is sooooo beautiful
God bless this man.
God bless him! We need more people like this in the world
He probably thought he was gonna get lucky
I only wonder if these women would do the same thing?? If i see how they dress, behave and all the diva nonsens i highly doubt they would bring the stuff back to the owner. These 2 definitely would keep the money. Also if the dude did it out of moral he wouldnt accept the money. But he does so nah.. he expect to get something in return. Thats not doing something out of good will.
Over 7 million views he's now Viral too, great person.
He probably saw that woman’s license and thought he was gonna get lucky.  When that lady answered the door and it wasn’t the chick on license he was like “damn!”. Come on now. People do this everyday , it doesn’t restore faith in humanity , this is a really stupid story.
I am fascinated by these kinds of videos. Americans go crazy about good deeds. As a german i can hardly relate. Here it is normal to do such a thing.
He is lucky. They could have been Karens. Started screaming, calling the cops. Get shot by them No questions asked..
Why is this on news
Good young man. I wish more people had his mentality in this country. Just do the right thing. We all know the difference between right and wrong... it's about caring to do what it right.
damn i wonder if he even got to dick them down hahahahahha
Luckily he's white. Otherwise there's definitely a chance he could've got cops called on him if he was black. 🇺🇲
He reminds me of my Lil nephew        “ Tiny Ope” 😭 👦🏻🤏🏼 , kids .. they grow up so fast 🕰💨
Your reward was doing the right thing; not the Dollars. 🫂
Never judge a book by its cover either because in all honesty at first look he looks like a little punk but obviously he’s actually a really respectable kid!
he stole it and got told by his mom to return it get it fuking right
shes hot i would return the purse too
Or this could be staged....jus sayin
Aww that's was nice
Omg  hope more than 20 bucks
Heartwarming! There is hope for the younger generations ❤
Good job kiddo 🎉
And if you saw him on a dark street you would think the wrong thoughts ! Never tell a book by its cover. Thank you young man.
He is cute 😍
99% of teenagers: MONAYYYYYYYYY 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑  This teenager: Being just like Jesus 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
I'd clap the cheeks of the 1 on the right 💯
He definitely saw the photo of the girl on the ID and thought "heres my chance" and was hoping shed be extra grateful
Bro looked at an id and thought he was going to get some like the corn hub videos
CHULA VISTA GANG
I hate him
I hate him
Amen what he did.keep up the good works and God will bless you more.  being a mother  is very happy and very proud what he did.
the young man's mother summed it up rather well, "do the right thing even when no one's looking"!
That's actually his mom and this a set up plot to gain 3k
I would have dropped it off if I saw the id
Salute!
Honesty is the best policy,, Good on you young man and your mum will be so proud of you along with a lot of other people including me. Cheers from Australia 👍
Foo was just tryna smash after he saw the license 🤣
He deserves more than 3k give the man some cochiee
This made me tear up. There is hope
JesusChrist loves you. Repent from your sins and follow Him
ANGEL 😇
beautiful
He fine
Bro completed a gta side mission
Thank goodness for this young man... restored my belief in humanity a little....
We do not care.
For some people doing the right thing gives a lot of satisfaction about oneself that is hard to explain, even small things and Big things (like this Gentleman in the video)
This vato is honest. I bet ppl judge him just cus of how he looks. Makes me happy he got this recognition ☺️☺️☺️☺️
Good one young man Bless you ❤️
Humanity in youth 💯💯
Prbly her nephew
if a white person did this, he wouldn't have gotten any money for helping
Guilt is a product of doing what you know is wrong and guilt kills the soul
Good deed like this is what tell me there is still hope on this earth  truly amazing
He's probably the one who stole it or was with someone who stole it
why does this feel like a dharman story
That’s awesome I’m really hoping this act of kindness can change many people
Plot twist: He actually stole the purse and after going through it and only finding $8 and a pack of juicy fruit gum he figured he just return it and act like he found it then hope there was at least a $20 reward... Lmao 😂😂😂
Awesome 👏🏻
God bless you all and your families 🙏🏽✝️🛐🛐
My future son
Thats awesome.  With as many pos greedy people in this country. I love seeing someone do the right thing. As bad as this country is getting it let's u know not all hope is lost
Good parents, good values!
What a beautiful story to come across, especially in the wake of so much evil around us. This lifted my spirits.
Awesome dude......your mama raised you well keep that inside you and pass it on to your children one
That’s a Heavenly Blessing peace
And he's handsome.... Bless his heart
That was awesome! Now if he was my kid I'd be like ok get something you need and pick a charity for the rest. We don't know what happened. Not my business. Just sayin.
Wait a minute "Is that a snake 🐍 behind in the background" lol
☺️
Good job young man I see a very bright future for you
Nothing just a simple man doing the right thing
I feel like these kinds of stories happen every day of kids returning peoples lost things, but just because he looks like a “gangster” he gets put on the news and everyone finds it so fascinating
Great young man with great parents that instilled such ethical behaviour in him. They and him should be immensely proud of of themselves and their son.
Good kid. Definitely raised right.
I always give people's stuff back and when I get rewards I always buy people dinner.
Yes 👏
Her aunt didn't ask for his name cause she's that 'all about me' type?
Awesome Honest people here
Kids listen to parents and this is the perfect example of raising a good child. Well done mama and the young man
Be the change you want to see . 🙌🏼Yess I love this.
Remember God is always watching even when you're thinking no one is
sees a sample size of 1 dude out of the whole younger generation, "There's hope for our younger generation"
Integrity is one of the highest values a man can posses.
He prob returned it because there was nothing in the bag he wanted to steal lmfao so he said lemme bring the bag back to see if I get anything in return lol some I’ll do
What a great young man and how cool that these women were able to get a reward for him. Love stories like this.
Poor little boy has got a chance to win himself some 🍑🍑 after his kindness 🤣🤣🤣
“Always do the right thing even when nobody’s looking.” Words to live by.
His mother raised him right.
Now that's gangster 😎
stevewilldoit gives away 20x this amount and doesn’t get this much attention for it
STUD 🙌🏽 BIG W
What a sweet story. I wish him nothing but the best! 🙏
Does anyone know his social media?
This is what happens when you set up a good moral compass.
Fake
Was that azzyland?
So this is what people raise money for now I get what he did was nice but common
An Audi and a chain in San Diego red flags he was probably stoned and forgot which team he was on. If I'm wrong the kid has character wish there were more of him out there.
Now, if the world had more people like this that be less negative news.
Good job.
Well done mate
fyffuju
This gives me hope for Gen-Z.
Wtf 3k reward? This is a lot more than I ear in a month
Be the change you want to see in the world
This is why I believe in karma you do bad things bad things happen to you and when you do good things good things happen to you
she probably looked fine in that id 😂
That's great 3k it should be enough to fill his gas tank for a week with this inflation and Biden hikes. 😂
This is how one to reward someone when they return your belongings. This act encourages people to do good deeds
One sad thing about this is that society has gotten so bad that people feel the need to pay for good deeds like this. It should be just normal for everyone to be like this without the thousands of dollars in return...
common samaritan dub
What was in the bag?
I could never I would take the purse 💀
bro dont need 3k for normal human decency lmao they deadass made a gofundme for that thats crazy
Being rewarded for being a good person. What a weird world we live in.
I love hearing this story!! So glad he was rewarded!!
Good kid
Well done young man
I would have never opened my door, unless I know you’re coming by I don’t answer.  Ohhh you go Adrain, good home training ! Gratitude
Aww thats a good wee dude there like, well done mate
that was nice
Good kid DEFINITELY can't say that in the UK though if anyone over here found missing stuff belonging to someone then that's it  it's theirs now
He returned the purse to the woman because there was no money in it and he couldn't steal her identity because he's a male while she's a female..... lol nah I'm only kidding, he's a good kid. God bless him.
He’s a part of the society, unlike those kids 4 of them who took my bag and ran away while I was sitting in the oval after jogging, I got no important stuffs except my working ID, it’s night time here in Brooklyn NY so I couldn’t catch them.
Bro was raised well
faith in humanity restored!! (for now)
Proud mama moment….good job!
God Bless his soul ...I love these stories  what a great reward he got .. definitely deserved it thou..
that guy looks like the type to steal the purse lol
When this is the exception rather then the norm you know America is in a bad bad bad place
It’s 14k now! Awesome!
He is a man of God and will always be blessed.
bro eliana got more plastic than the ocean ong
Aww blessed his heart 🤎
what a top g
fine young man lmaoooo
The Gofundme has raised more than 14k today
See black people is not bad
My guy! 👜👈😉👍✨
Also, don’t judge a book by the cover, the kid looks kinda sketchy but is actually totally honest👍
Congratulations on a good deed done! God bless you young man ,
The little homies make us so proud 😭
Good advice from mom
Such stories warms your heart and restore faith in humanity!
I wonder how bro is doing today
This why i like watching inside edition
Although in this process the teen did loose his belt, so he had to pull up his pants all the time
If cops saw this one when the boy was coming towards the owner then, they thought it is robber.  And racist begins!
prove : dont judge a book by its cover ❗
❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
and this guy will be proffesional wallet returner for the rest of his life
Finna have Hella hynas on his fierro 😎
I salute you, kid! Its easier to just claim it and all but you gave it back.
Another example of dont judge the book by its cover, I can tell that because of the way he looks.
Kool💯!
I returned a billfold with 800 dollars in it an got a bottle of old crow bourbon for it.
This should be an obvious thing, dont take whats not yours, its sad that it isnt
I returned a billfold with 82 dollars in it and got a "thanks."
Omg i cried
Young man with integrity 👏
His Momma must be proud. I hope he enjoys his reward.. it's well deserved 👏
Raising your kids right can make all the difference in the world!
Should be the norm and not the exception
Way the go Adrian! Hope life rewards you even more with tons of success and love.
In many States, if you pick up a lost wallet or lost purse, it's automatically considered as theft. If the owner ever decided to press charges on you, there is a great chance that the charge will hold. I wish I don't have to be so discouraging, but...be careful when you want to do these kind of stuffs.
He's storing his treasures in heaven.
Ok time to give him the money and make new video :p
Let’s calm just a bit. Go fund me is at 14k rn dawg. That’s a nice used car
What a very special young man he is to do such a wonderful thing to deliver someone’s handbag back to then he has a heart of gold well done mate great 👍 work
Reward or no reward, if you ALWAYS DO what's RIGHT, whether you're being watched or not...you're conscience will always be clear. 🤔😁👍🏻🤗🥰💖🇨🇦
I don't remember where I learned it but I passed it down to my own children "Character, is how you act when no one is looking."
$3k?!?!
Facts : The guy opened the wallet and just wanted a date with the girl in the picture. If she was ugly, he wouldn't have bothered. I could bet it.
rare things right now.....a good Man
That's nearer 4K
You can tell he has held his mama's purse a lot before.  So gentle when coming to the door.  Great job!
It’s awesome seeing this type of stuff happen. That guy has a good head on his shoulders.
Good on him for setting a good example! Always do the right thing. :)
The way he looks and dress, you would never expect it. Never judge.
Angels disguised themselves. You never know.
Good news for our society. Good job mate. 👍
Why is this a Big thinbg,isnt it normal to deliver stuff back if u know the owner??
It would of been a different story if police happen to find him holding a bag on the way to her house.
Plot Twist : He returned empty purse.
Oh he fine 😍🤭
Proud of him. He’s amazing!!
A child is a mirror of his/her parents. He is raised well.
bros like “where’s my head?”
What an amazing young man!!🙌🏾
Awesome buddy. I love this kid.
🧡🧡🧡🧡
Awesome
Proud of this Mexican American young gentleman.
plot twist: hes a high level drug dealer that doesn't need chump change cause he got cartel money  lol
$14,152 USD raised of $1,000 goal
I've done this once where my 3k
He could just gave to the grocery store lol
What a good kid!
hope? in that state? lmao nice joke
Congratulations King 💫💯
I found a wallet at a boot store one day as a kid, gave it to the clerk, kept shopping for boots with my parents and then an older guy came up to me and asked me if I was the one with his wallet and became irate because he said I stole it. Of course dad backed me up and he left but, yeah…. No 3k
Now this is a young man who has been raised right. An absolute credit to his parents. Well done sir very well done.
W Kid🎉♥️💯
This is the best proof don't judge a person by his clothes/color. Because I think that when you see him walk outside, thinking that he is the one of the last persons to do this.  And he can be very proud of himself and also proud that he has a very good mother.
Good to see young generation like this, good job kid be a good sample to your generation. God Bless you and your family.
USD14000 by today 5 July 2022
That’s so sweeeeet!
Awesomeness!😇💪
Amen! Good boy God bless you Always 🥰🤗
isn't it a little over 10k now?
he was tryna get with them hynas
Awesome. His family raised him to be honorable and true to himself.
Bless his heart
May God always show him uncommon favor🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
I was brought up the same way. Good man👍 he listened to his Mother. 👏👏👏
He a good kid still but I think he seen some identification pics and was like I got a good shot if come by at dusk...hehehe
What is the go fund me page to make  donation?
He just wanted that Milf😎
NEWS? Huh!
Legend
I expected something else 😏
♥️ protect that kid
INTEGRITY at its best!!!…
This young man was raised right and it shows. Best wishes for him to succeed and do well in life.
respect✊🏼
nah, he saw the drivers license and was hoping to shoot his shot XD
Who else thinks that He probably knew this two beautiful lady’s and he just wanted to talk to them 😀😀
If this was Texas, he would have been shot on sight.
Salute
see this happens when responsible parents raised their children the good way.
"Orale Pendejooooo!" 😂
I’d bet he’d rather have 30 mins with the brunette
Salute
I remember I found an man’s purse that was stolen but had drivers license passport and some valuable documents inside, I gave it to my mom and she found the guy to return the stuff, this MF was so ungrateful thinking I stole it and threatened to call the cops on me… that day I lost faith in humanity
Damn that is at least 3k worth of plastic surgery
It's normal to return things, we just live below the bare minimum
fake
This is the definition of the phrase “Don’t judge a book by its cover”.
always do the right thing, he is real man bey. u have a calling bruh
Good man
"The kindness that you put in this world will come back to you. One way or another."
That's nice, but he's not alone in sporting honesty
what is this? , GTA anyways still fye tho
I think it’s common in Japan
what good parenting does to a kid
He saw the driving licence picture and thought hmm, lemme check this out
it’s sad that might think of him as a bad person bcs of how he dresses etc never judge a book by its cover ❤️❤️.
Much respect
不管這男孩做了什麼~不影響他在白人警察面前的死亡率~上帝不存在🤪
but was there even any thing good in the perse is the real question like if there was money over $100 that wouldnt of been returned kekwi bet if 3k was in it she wouldnt of got
chad man
Awesome that he did the right thing. Depressing that it's a big deal.
Awesome kid! We need more like this these days!
He smashed both of them after…..
Dang must be nice enough to be able to just give people 3k like it’s nothing. Edit: never mind it was a fund raiser lol.
Hope for humanity  Restored
Nice i hope men still following their mom advice and dont let a modern women get u because this day I've seen so many women hate men that love their mom  it like when your mom is on hospital and have to cancel the honeymoon but your girl decided to make a tik tok/video about that and the comments will be full of modern women saying *momma boys* like why? I dont understand 😭
Here ya go, 👑. You dropped this King. Go buy yourself some drip 💯
I would of accept another type of payment 😂
It’s always nice to see positive things on the news for once.
Plot twist "His the one who stole it in the first place"
im going to spoil the heart felt moment for all of you.. but i know these people and it was all a ruse for them to split 4 grand.. lil homie told me himself..
He looks like a thug but his heart is so sweet❤️
Wow wow and wow .,,
He will grow up to be a good man because of the way he was raised  !! Way to go mom !!
Good for people to reward teens or recognize and give .thanks
1 kid did 1 thing I still belive there's no hope for this younger gen
Bravo lil mexican kid 🌿
God bless this young man!! Thank you Adrian R  for returning the purse!
Foos gone good
it's always good to do the right thing =)
Love this
"Do the right thing when no one was watching." That's integrity that I hope becomes contagious.
he hit
Good job. A wonderful act in the time when everyone else wants bad.
Amazing how someone so young can stay strong and honest in the world we live in today! I hope there’s more youngsters like him!
Yes
We must all be like him 🙏🏼
He smashed fosho.
Love to his mother and him! AMAZING
Great young man God protect him
God is 😊 good.
Good deed
Mannn that kid saw how fine she was on her ID, and shot his shot. I hope he gets that work at some point for the gesture lol
Lol they made a go fund me raised 10k for him to give him 3 Ig 🙄
I came here just to like the video of that young man doing the right thing without a guaranteed reward. 💯
This is what happens when you love your children in the proper.  This is called a gentlemen & more of a man than most!  His mom is deserving of a company car from the state.
👍
Only in America, your shocked. In my country...just a normal thing.
Crazy because the average elderly person would judge him by how he’s dressed before getting to know the person
Good kid. Correctly raised by his parents. Now, I'd suggest he use the money to give back to others HE knows to help them out. Pay it forward!!!!
What a Humble young man😇
In Russia, they would have been tied up and brought in for theft, because if the person who lost wrote a statement about the theft to the police, it is no longer possible to withdraw or stop it, even if the person who lost does not want to attract
Eliana🔥
I wish somebody returned my wallet, I lost mine back in 2012 with over £300 along with all my cards, pretty sure there was over a gram of base in it too, the base was awesome, I had been flying for two days on it when I lost my wallet.
What a good guy! :D
"There's hope for younger generation " classic Boomer line , he shouldn't have returned it
Love to see it. Much love to him and everyone for stepping up.
That guy .. every women wanted .. he a good guy..
God bless the good-hearted boy! I'm an English learner, can somebody help me with understanding what Melina said at 0:40? What did she say after she said, "Did you get his name?"?
Bless his heart!
The naivety in the comments. Maybe he stole it and then returned it for a reward. Many criminals will be doing this type of thing now. Kudos to him if he didn't.
oh yawp
Ah, people like this kid keeps my hope alive. So heartwarming.
Bless this Kid 🙏🏻🙏🏻  raised by gud parents
It's called having values/principles! But he has an awesome mom who taught him well ,something most parents don't do nowadays
mumma raised him well
Such an amazing story. I remember when I was in school I found an expensive phone near the school street and gave it back to the person after contacting him. The person then spoke to my principal and it was announced in the morning assembly one day. Some kids cheered and some others told me why hadn't I kept it. But in the end, doing the right thing always feels incredible.
Good man
He’s cute
Amazing!
Setting an example!! AWESOME!! GOD BLESS THIS GUY!!
His parents raised him RIGHT.
He is eminem in disguise.
People have a low bar 🫤
He looks like a thief tho
He deserved every cent of that 3k! 👌
Books and their covers. Good on you young fella
he should deserve a quickie
Apa si
Both should of topped him off
Just proves that one of the biggest problems today is a lack of parenting. Good on this young man and the mom who instilled good values.
Tbh id do the same thing if I was not so lazy
Is it just me, or is he like really cute.
im sorry but even after this there really isn’t any hope for our generation
Good young man he was raised well.
I did that once, and they didn't even said thank you!  It was about $800 in 20 bills
I love him this is a beautiful human and his mom is right!!  😂♥️🥰
He's amazing 😔❤️
Her friend fine
Doing what's right even when no one is looking - integrity 👌🏿💯
What did he say tho???
Good on him. He deserves all good things in life!
In India, you would become a suspicious person to be aware of if you returned the purse.
I'm glad I watched this video.  To many times I've been negative toward youthful people.  This young man has good character and he's caused me to not be so judgemental in the future.
There’s still hope for our world!
Yes.... We have... big hope for the future generation 🙌
Praise the lord thank you Jesus Canada 🇨🇦
It's great to see people like this getting what they deserve for doing the right thing.
They set that kid up to screw him.
Well honestly I would have done the same.
God bless that teenage
he fine
He was raised well
You really can't judge the book by its cover.
Perfect example of why you should never judge a book by its cover
The world is slowly becoming a better place
That’s awesome!!!
And in Japan this is normal🤣!!
His mama raised him right!
I wish nothing but the BEST for this boy as he journeys in life.
The Wold Shall Hear From Me Again. Not a gain? Nope. It Phews man chewing and this Ming is Merciful - I hope. Fangs for the Random Memories Daft Punks. Rochester Way's Van Jones?
Good kid🙌
respect +100
Most news is lucky to get 20-50k views on their vid if lucky. This one has 6.4mil right now. Maybe good news is more popular than the bad after all.
Warms my heart <3 The GoFundme is at $13k
Id give her the money back if she wanted those sweet Latina Cheeks Clapped!!!! Yahhhh Pappi don't stop aiii yaaah yahhh
@1:01 Integrity! Great job young man!!👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
That’s so cool… especially since we know it’s wasn’t over $3000 in the purse. He got paid for being honest! 👌🏾Good man!
Hope for humans yet ❤️
Thank you Sir for being kind.
Great ....Job. one time I did same to a lady she didn't even say thank you ...I guess
Especially in the South this is just expected like holding doors for people and saying ma'am or sir
He can finally buy himself a belt.
Fine young man? Who put that he's 17 yo boom cancelled
I love this kid's action. This will be on his resume throughout the world forever.
Lucky.  I brought back a wallet i found once and was accused of stealing it.
Awesome... 🙌🙌🙏 Latinos
He amazing God bless him
he is so fine 🙏
Also side note, but he's really handsome
RESPECT 🤙❤️❤️❤️🇦🇺
His mama is raising him just right! My mom didnt teach me any of the sort, but i made sure to teach myself
Sweet Handsome Young Man God Loves You 💖
Say a lot for good parenting.
That’s nice, but here’s the thing how the heck he knew that it’s her purse the lost one and then knew her address??
LI
Glad to see Latino Brothers making an strong example of Latino community excellence we need more of this. Latinas can appreciate.
Everytime I do the right thing I just hear Chris Rocks voice saying “that’s what you’re supposed to do… whatchu want, a cookie!?”
The sad part is that this is remarkable. It should be normal. I've done similar things, but I've also known people who lost things and they got stolen. You forget a purse on the bus, and when it turns up it's empty.
Handsome and kind
thank you for rewarding him..
You're gonna go far, kid
He wanted more than 3k 🤣🤣🤣
I also have return someone wallet .and karma reward me back when i lost mine someone also return mine
He is fineee 😧😧😧😧😧
Its actually sad this is rare in the west. Quite common in countries like Dubai, Saudi Arabia, Oman the culture and religion teaches us to do good cause when you think no one is watching ? The Almight is. There is gonig to be consequence for everything if the police dont catch you doing the dirty things you do.
Shiii he was tryna clap
Way to go bud,getting in peoples good graces equals a bright future.
The lady seemed like she didn't even know she lost it. So strange
Do the right thing even when nobody's watching, 3some it is ladies 🤣
Good man.. well done buddy👍🇺🇸
Bless the lord
"Why did you return the purse?" "Tbh her picture looked hot and it was a Thursday with nothing to do so... you know"
Kids got a bright future. I pray for his protection.
How is this news?  This is suppose to be common sense.
That guy is great. and 3k reward, WOW! Good work guys!
California land of Mexicans 😎
in islam this is a normal thing it happens all the time
Everybody liked that
What an awesome mom & a good son.💖😊 Greetings from the Philippines.
A good samaritan for sure. Glad rewards came back to him.
👏🏽 there is hope lol
Good kid 🤜🏽🤛🏽🤝🏽
There is a God after all
Awesome.good parents .. good kids💓
I love to see good people and acts of kindness 💜 it's so refreshing to see videos like this instead of the negative in this world!! May many blessings come to that young man an his family.
That's a golden rule: do unto others what you want others to do unto you
Sounds like a Dhar Mann video
I’ve seen other movies that start just like this 😜😆😆😆
More people like this Lfg
The world needs this kind of person..salute and respect 💪🔥
Wow This honestly happened to me. I hadn't been home 5 minutes and was a buzz. Lady asking for me. Showed me my wallet. Now I'm thankful to her and her partner for taking their time and going out of their way to give it back to me. I had no money to pay them though. I do remember a few years ago. This person didn't have enough money just to buy food for his family like proper food 🍲 not crisps and snacks. This was like veg and other dinner bits. When he put things aside and paid what he could afford, I offered to pay what he couldn't afford. I put a smile not just on his face but the lady on the checkout too. I said I was only buying goody snacks and sugar coated chocolate. But this guy is trying to feed his family properly. I can at least help. My food is not essential. His was.
What a wonderful young man! ♥️
Cute as hell too.
Never judge a book by its cover
Honesty is the best policy. Losing your purse is a just a terrible thing.
Imagine he toke the money and stuff from the bag got the 3k and ran lmao.
nah this some real talk rn, everyone knows why he returned that purse… that shawty bad😭
He was definitely raised right. If it was anyone else they probably wouldn't of returned the purse.
That’s awesome! My hats off to this guy… A true stand up guy who was raised right… just like his mom told used to tell him you do what’s right even when knowone is watching…💯
lol people really do be starting Gofundme for the most random thing.
It gives me hope to see a young man do this good dee god will bless him
Weird thing happened among thousands!
GREAT GREAT GUY.
Why this is even a news? Isn’t it how we all live? I would do the same and I believe everyone I know would do the same.. We’ve reached a level where returning someone’s purse has become viral news. Should I be worried?
Respect for that boy.
A fellow Adrian pog
I found a purse once and when I gave it back they accused me of stealing their money when the purse was never opened I gave it directly to employees
🥺🥺🥺
Wow this man is amazing he found a womens purse and it had like money and phones
Good luck in life for this yong man 🌟☘️🌟☘️🌟☘️🌟☘️
yes there’s hope i’ve done this multiple times haha
W
Try losing it in philippines 🤡
God loves you
God bless everyone have a great day be safe
On this day, 4th of July, I want to say this young man is what this country needs more of.  Integrity, a sense of justice, and caring for their fellow man. If we could all be a little more like him in our day to day interactions we'd be growing towards a better tomorrow.
She a real one for giving the 3k
Patunay na mayaman talaga ang bansa na2 kung sa pinas yan hahaha bihira lang
Did you give him a good time too?
Nice !
That woman with black hair is beautiful. She probably looked hot in her license. I would have returned it too and asked her out lol
🙏🔥🔥🔥🔥
This young man was raised right. Integrity is doing the right thing when nobody is looking.
OMGGGOSGHH THIS IS HUGE NEWS, UNBELIEVABLE!! WOW SOMEONE WITH ETHICS??? WOAHHH WTHHH GIVE HIM A REWARD
he scored a treesome
I loved that he look like a gangster but really nice human inside.
good boy.!!!
US WHITES NEED TO HELP THIS DARLING, LETS BUILD HIM A CABIN
Not from them. Lol 20 bucks rest from the world lol
Good stuff, man!!!
For our Hispanic future everyone else sucks right now. But also show how cheap the lady is. 20 bucks for over 3000 grand lol 😂
A respectfull cuh
Great job young man I hope your peers can understand this.Good will always beat bad anyday
God blessed him always 🙏
That’s so awesome congratulations to you young man keep your head high and continue to be an amazing honest person
I know it's not quite the same thing, but I was walking home one day and dropped my license out of my pocket and didn't realise until I'd gotten home. About 30 minutes later someone knocked on my door and dropped it off at my house. It was such a nice deed.
Good kid he's a good kid
i dont trust him
👏🏼
Mama taught him well
Love this ❤️❤️❤️
A very good boy. Was raised by a good mom and I wonder who is his mom 🤔 But did the right thing to return the purse to those fine ladies. That's what sup!!!
Bless his soul.
Great he returned the purse sad that its so uncommon for ppl to be decent human being’s that u get praised and rewarded just for it
I woulda just bought him a belt
Omg!!!
bros fine af and kind at the same time💯
I'm sure they were hoping for more $$. People don't fall for that nonsense no more.
I thought it was 10k. Wtf happened?
What a chad
3 BANDS?! Lord, I’ve seen what you’ve done for others. 🤞🏽😂💪🏽 Good on him though!
Imagine if he stole the purse earlier.
The reward of good parenting is good human beings
Props to this kid and to his mother for raising him with morals and integrity.
🥰🥰🥰
Don't expect much to have more people like him, he is an exceptional teen and his personality is like 1:10M of the world population
dang good job bro
W
Pay it forward. :)
Good kid!👏
❤️❤️❤️☝️
I love good kids. ❤️
We need more people like thia
The time I tried to return a lady's purse I was pulled over and police said I had stolen the purse....
Nice!
he is a good human being .bless him and his whole faMily
It matters what we instill in our children 💗
Maybe humans aren’t doomed..
i came here for a shoot out!! like captin custard and Geronimo!🤡
reporters voice sounds like a reporter on the simpsons.
"Fine good man" nice bro👍
It’s all the parents. At least one good parent gives a kid a chance.
What I don't get is why those ladies give him a small reward since the bag was full with money, this whole situation now seems like a go fund me scam.
Finally the news is talking about the good things 👍
Now he’s got 3100 total from the purse
Is this for real???  Someone from kakafonia?????  Hard to believe.
Definition of “Integrity!”
Nah bruh his friend stole that bih and he returned it tryna get a reward
That's a good lad.
Funny I've often handed in wallets etc and flat out received barely a thank you....😑
That's what everyone should do in that situation.  But big hand to him and his great parents.
Imagine trump returning the purse, or giving a reward? Nah me neither
God love him.
Beautiful!
He mentioned his Mama... she raised a good one.
I love how they say “there is hope for our  younger generation”  yall raised us! 😂
Twenty years ago I found $4000 in the back of my taxi. The patron stopped me from leaving to count it making sure it was all there. When satisfied that nothing was missing she gave me two gumdrops as a reward.
What a fine young man!  I’m sure his family is very very proud of him 👏👍🥰
Americans discovering ethics
What’s sad is that doing what should be a normal thing is seen as amazing
He did a good deed.....he there no hope for the Next generation...out of 100 kids his age....85 of them Gon steal the purse and go thru it💯💯💯💯
Thank you for sharing such a awesome story, I love this young man and what he said his mom taught him.   We need to bring more light to the good
I love this story. Wonderful reward for this young man.
Thats an example of good parenting and a good heart
Good on ya lad👏👍
I am inspired
This is a good boy. He followed his mom's wise teaching.
🙏
Screw the money I would of got her number instead.
You know he got that money and these two beautiful women gave him the best blowj** of his life
aunt was a baddie. would of done the same.
Plot twist: he stole the purse then returned it for the reward
Thank God bc if he gave it to the cops or grocery store workers she never would've gotten it back.
🥰🥰🥰
Then there was someone who returned 30k and only got 500 as a reward
He is that 15% hope. Now I want to know if all of us can do the same so we all can be that 100% hope. For the next generation. This year just got me feeling down. Nothing too special. Just plain home staying. I can't go outside like I normally can because of the virus. But back to topic. I want all of us to also be like him.... Kind..
Lmfaooooo, this man was like damn, she kinda hot, im gonna scope this out.
We need more people like this
Honesty is a great policy!
Nah Brodie was tryna hit
Wow so nice of him
Suprice surice the realy good people don't wear suits
only in america you can get on tv just by returning a purse... 🤦‍♂️
Now this is a man. Also props to the women who didn't judge his appearance and found the goodness in his deed and intention.
A Good deed gets a good reward even when it's not expected.
Proud of you young man!
he stole it and returned it for the reward
Don't judge a book by it's cover.
Good kid 😎👍
This rare
Gofundme caption “fine young man raised by parents right” dam i thought it was just me she is a milf🤣🤣🤣
Ngl I feel like he just took it and waited for the reward
14000 th comment
CRAZY CHOLITO!😁
That makes me happy to see there is still some good left in the world
Now that is a very good young man.
Plot twist he stole the bag and planned to get a reward with his great actions !
Yeah I'm pretty sure if there was a large sum of money in there.. LOL
I don’t have that luck so I would’ve just had to do with what’s in there
This says a lot about manners and values he was taught. And great if I lost something of mines I would want someone to return it . And young people out there this should be an example of how kindness to others goes a long way.
thats a good kid right there
Something you don't see most of the times! There's one awesome teen in San Diego! Nice to see these videos!
Great man-May he go places in life!
GOOD JOB KID!
Lets be honest $3k cash on top of that fine wine dine 😋
👏🏻👍🏻🫶🏻
Some people see him as a gangster cuz of how he’s dressed but don’t judge a book by it’s cover cuz he not a gangster
That boy's mama raised him right
imagine he did that cuz his friends dared him to steal it.
Great job to this young man...and his mother for raising him with strong values. I pray for abundance in his life.
Faith in Humanity still exists and this is the proof
Can I have address of this young good man ?
Low key he was actually just tryin to get some cheeks
Staged fake nonsense
Plot twist, the purse doesn't have any cash, so he thought by returning it he may get some for the reward
He has integrity
I know this foo he went to otay ranch but he just graduated this year
Guess there was not that much in the purse 🤣🤣🤣! However nice touch bringing the stuff back, at least he got his reward.
thats a real gangsta right there
There is hope! I tip my hat to you good sir
Thank you for such a positive story!
Good job young man, may life be full of this type of things.
THAT YOUNG MAN DESERVED THE 3000 HE GOT BUT AN EXTRA THREESOME WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE
Shouldve asked em both on a date
Man's playing GTA V side mission
Tell him split me 600
hey moma i got a good idea.... lets pretend i'm a random kid who found your purse and returned it to you.....  Ay papi, thas a good idea. we can start a go-fund me and send it to the news
And it's a Little Green Bag. Lol
brotha did the right thing and all he got was a hand shake, not even gas money with 6 dollar cali gas, only reason he got 3k waws over a gofundme
Both blonds 😂
real good kid and he was definitely raised right
What a great example for everyone to be. BTW it's now up to 13k well deserved
Investing in cryptocurrency is the best way of getting ahead to build wealth, investing remains a priority. The Cryptocurrency market has plenty of opportunities to earn a decent payouts, with the right skills and proper understanding of how the market works.
Y’all lame for not at least dropping to go fund me link, y’all used his story to make him money and aint hook him up with a link a the description
I wish this young man and his family many, many good things in life.  He is a real class act.👍
I taught my son who is 20 yrs old just to do the right thing & be considerate of others. About 2 years ago, my son found a young woman's wallet on the busy street about 2 miles from my home. He came home & showed me the wallet & then we looked at her license.  I found her name on Facebook & I dm to her. We met up at the gas station right around the corner from my house. She was very thankful & grateful. She lost her wallet while riding her bike. She pulled out her phone from her pocket & then her wallet fell off. She had everything that was in her wallet.  She did offer us a ride home but we lived about 2 blocks, so there's no need. No reward needed bc I just think she finally got it back & no need to start all over again. That's the reward.   There should be humanity in this world & all we have to do just keep believing it. Great job young man! Btw, it happened in New Orleans, so just keep believe that there's humanity & consideration in this crazy ass city!
Hell yeah
MEMORIES BROKEN
Now thats the example of a good person we all need to take note of. Guaranteed people look at the way he dresses & assume he's some thug. Kudos young man for proving otherwise.  You have become a good responsible man & the entire world recognizes that , supports  & respects you.
Good job young man, you will go to places with this mindset
My man did the right thing AWESOME!!!!!!!!
This is a skit don't believe the hype!!!
W mans
This is the kind of story I needed to hear
Don't get me wrong, but I feel like this shows how bad the world is right now, when this kinda stuff is insanely rare. Good for him 👏
thank you to Inside Edition for showing us this wonderful story, with all the bad news today it is really awesome to see something POSITIVE : ) God Bless that young lad
💛
It sucks that this is some big deal. I mean it happens all the time in a country of 400million or so, but clearly nowhere near enough. But anyway, he coulda just gave it to the store and they'd have handled it. I'm just saying that so people know that it's that easy. You can drive it to them but there's always a little risk involved...and gas is expensive. When you have their stuff in your possession, that alone is a risk. For example you get pulled over and a cop sees her purse inside. "I was just returning it, officer". "Oh sure you were." Or what if that person has been missing? Now you're connected to the case. Or what if her jealous husband answers the door? So there's reasons why people don't bother. Give it to the manager and I'm sure the woman will return to the store to get it or get called to pick it up. Yes, I wrote way too much here.
So good video🙏
He is like rengoku. His mother is also Rengoku's mother.
So everything went according to his plan... he he he.
That reminds a few years ago after a long day at work on my way home, I realized I saw an expensive phone on the sidewalk. I end taking home, charge it for a few hours & decide to scroll down some numbers & I end up recognizing one of the numbers that was on the phone & found out it was my friend's mom phone. I end walking to her apartment, who lives a few houses from mine & return it no expecting any reward, but my friend's mom got in contact with my number, call me to her apartment & quietly gave $500.
Integrity = "doing the right thing when no one is watching."
Finally
So where's the video of him getting his money
What a good kid! He's proof there's still some out there!
W comments
LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! 🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 This was definitely needed after today’s shooting in Chicago at the Independence Day parade!!! 😞 At least they got the shooter… 😡😡😡
Is there like a couple thousand dollars in the purse, LMAO.
He probably stole it and was scared so he returned it lol
Amen
Auntie is looking more like mami!
This happens once in a million times in America. Cmon now we have amateur looters stealing from department stores and professional congress looters stealing from the people. Stop this propaganda.
This is fantastic!!! Great young man right there !!! 🙏🏼❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
The sparks of the youth!! There still bright hope for them and the next generation after them
8y0bii
more kids need to be like him.
Baller
If "do the right thing" whas ah person🤦🤣
This guy is a great guy, a REAL superstar! Kudos to him for being honest.
Bro wanted to tap
his good heart makes him so attractive
can i smell your purse 🤔
That's so cool. What a good kid.
What a good karma
Man this kid found em on Facebook and was hoping to get lucky with two hot milfs 😂😂
This just proves that even if they look like a thug or criminal that they can still be so kind to humanity 😊.
Good deed....👍
this show us all even though all we see in the media is bad there is still a lot of good young people in this world in my opinion far more good than the bad
respect to this gentleman
doing the right thing when no when is watching is the only way it is right
Find him guys
Awesome!!!!
This right here is why we need a Good Summaritan law.  They ought to be rewarded and these stories need to be spread to inspire more similar acts but they also shouldn't be punished punatively by the IRS just because they were given a well deserved reward.  Rewards for good deeds shouldn't be a taxable event
Awesome young man,Jesus bless
Wow salute for this young man for being a YOUTH MODEL of the CENTURy!
Hi
Heyy
He's going to go far in life, and is going to be greatly blessed by his Heavenly Father for doing a righteous act! He has a wonderful mother too for raising such a precious young man! 🤗
It’s like a darr man video in real life
Wow! This kid is a future republican!! Well done!
I returned a wallet with $684 in it. He offered me $20 or so. I refused,  it wasn't  a big deal
It is refreshing
its past  13,000  now...
Well done boy. 👏🏻
Hooray Adrian! The news was so bad, lately, I beelined to a positive article like this to give me hope in humanity. You didn't disappoint. The best to you!
Eliana Martin should dye her hair green .... she'll look great next christmas!
💯🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙏🏽💕
I'm like him. I do stuff like this all the time
Mommas raising him right
When I was a kid a thousand years ago my mom used to tell the same thing. Never take what does not belong to you just do what this young kid did return it.
👍😁👍
He probably thought she looked good so he returned it hoping for a more physical type of reward.
Must not have been any cash in it
For the Win!🥳
He was result of his  upbringing. Hope the best  of life  to the young man.
I use to work at the Cheesecake Factory while back, I was about 19 found an envelope on a table and right away looked and saw it was at least 5k$, I immediately gave it to my manager and minutes after an older woman came in crying, but they gave it back to her, it was her tax money 💰, 4000$, sadly I didn’t get a dime, but the point is there’s still good people and I’d do it again 🙏🏽, also this video is in my neighborhood here in San Diego, crazy!
That was really nice
Lol what a guy, a true homie.
Good lad!
That's  GREAT Stuff :) Good work, brother :)
There should be more people like him. Do to others what you want done to you. If everyone lived by this the world would be a better place.
Wow! God bless this boy. He’s growing into a great young man.
Smells like another last $20 gas station bandit.
Too late.  Eliana should've gave him something right then and there when he returned the purse.  She didn't even ask for the kid's name.  Even just $20 is a nice gesture, let him go get some Mcdonald's or something.  But no, nothing, just slammed the door in his face.  🤣
“Fine young man raised by parents right” 😭😭😭😭😭
Good job bud. You stand out from the rest. Keep it real, hope remains.
BIG UP's to his mom for raising her son right.😉
What an awesome young man being a wonderful example of honesty and integrity!
Facts my momma said the same thing , You never know who watching
Wow what a an impressive young man.
This kid knows about morals and principles
God bless this young man. Thats nice.
He just tryna hit
One in a million!
dawg look like Slump6s💀
Who cares. Literally who cares. Someone did a good deed. Wow. He already got $3k. I do good things everyday, i work my ass off and get absolutely nothing. This mf gets a world of praise and a couple thousand. Weird world we live in
he's was probs trying to hit lowkey😂
That's nice he made a good choice this is also good for future job references
dope!
God 🙏🙏 is coming back repent now before it's too late 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Damm I would of saw that I'd and bring it back tooooo
You did the right thing bro 😎👍👍👍
Could anyone find him?
It’s great that many pitched  in to reward the young man.
That's wonderful and shame on some of these wealthy people who would only give them a handshake or $5🤔❤️🖤💚
That a relief
Lmfao lies..
What an Angel he is! What an awesome story❣💫💖
I thought it was common sense to return it😂 people make big deals out of everything😂
What a remarkable young man.  His mom raised a fine man.  I pray that he will continue to be a caring person.  May God richly bless him for his honesty.
I should of filmed myself when I returned myself to my old wife. I did the right thing by coming back so where is my reward?
Story actually gives me hope for our youth!!!  Good Job young Man!!!
GUYS, he got a bag for returning a BAG 🫢🤭
Such a beautiful story…. And absolutely great parents that raised that young lad
he gets 3 k a guy returns 700k worth of money to get a reward of 500 dollars
Why don't all news stations understand that love sells way more than fear?! We want more of this!!
You see that's why you should never judge someone by their appearance. My mom and aunt would've thought he was some punk with no respect because of how he's dressed and I bet most people think that too. This video right here is a good example of never judge a book by its cover.
“Fine young boy” 😂😂😂
Nobody just leaves their purse in a grocery store😂 if u do well that’s pretty pathetic. Kid stole purse, nothing in it for him. After going thru it, finding ID, he returned it, and got 3k. If ur an honest person u bring it to PD😂
“Why did you go out of your way to return the purse”  Bro I would’ve been like, “can I not or something”
Good man.
he’s cute🤭
Nice work, my dude!
Awesome job awesome job that's what you call doing what's right when nobody's looking.....
Anyone know her address I might come and steal her purse just so I can return it.
Wholesome
One very important thing here he said his mom always taught him to do the right thing .  We don’t have to worry about changing the whole world. Let’s focus on affecting our family and love ones, that’s the world GOD gave us . He will take charge of changing the world through our work in our family .
This is something John Cena would do.
Hey fine to 🫣
“There’s hope for our younger generation” gurl no there isn’t 😭 .
Real niqqa shii
I clicked on this video I thought the title was going to be return lost purse gets arrested happy i was wrong
this foo hella studius
You should never judge a person by how they look like or by their physical appearance he's a Samaritan
I've returned lost wallets before. Do the right thing.
❤️😭
Integrity!!
This brings me to tears, such a sweet story🥹
He definitely checked the wallet to see if there’s any money
See...this is living proof when parents do good parenting it will reflect on the child.  Stop blaming others if your kids did something bad it's all about being a parent and setting good example for your kids.  The mother should get parenting award.
Let me know if you lose your keys or something at your house  I'll go and find em for 2.5k lmao
Give that kid a medal! he’s a better man than I was at his age xD
I thought the thing,I would like for someone to do the for me
He,s not the only one that does that .but cool
Only cuz he's black he got 3k if he was white he would got a hear ya go Timmy here's a shiny nickle
That the right thing to do I did the same thing in Corpus Christi Texas I found the purse in a basket at home Depot the lady she thousands of dollars in it,she was a reality estate agent I got reward $50
What a cutie, there's hope!
Waoo que lindo Dios lo bendiga!!
Respect🙏🫵🏽
This kid stole the purse lol how is that not obvious?
Good heart partner.
FAKE ASS Story remember this is inside edition worse credit than Fox News
No it’s speaks a lot about you. When did he request donations??
If only he was 18....
"Don't judge a book by its cover."
Oh I thought everybody is like that 😂 I lost my phone twice and people always gave it back to me… hopefully people should learn to do that at school not for a good deed but for a right thing to do.
Mashallah brother
R.I.P🤍🙏🏾🕊 I pray for her family, friends, and all who knows and loves her. I pray that her family, friends, and all who knows and loves her knows that she is no longer in pain. I pray that her family, friends, and all who knows and loves her knows that she is RESTING IN HEAVEN WITH GOD AND JESUS CHRIST AMEN🤍🙏🏾.
This is a reflection of how this young man was raised. Keep doing the right thing young man.
There is hope
Screw that lady. “There’s hope for our younger generation”. Our younger generation is fine, boomer
✊🏾
Good Deeds
Need more ppl pushing these messages!!!
If only our leaders & politicians would do the right thing even when nobody is watching...
I would be so proud of him, if he were my son. Good for him! Don’t ever lose that trait young man! The world needs more people just like you!
I hope the person(s) who got my Amazon boxes mistakenly delivered to their apartment door,  will "do the right thing" and bring them to  my apartment door😔
Great News!!! Need More News Like This Shared Instead Of Death, Disaster,& Dislike.
That’s awesome!
Good stuff little man that’s a stand up thing to do keep it up 👍🏼
Why does she say "There is hope for our younger generation" when the younger generation is better than previous generations?
Good example that great parenting can go along way.
What's his insta
Be that kind of Parent !👍💯
What a good guy he is indeed
Theirs only a few people like us young man. I hope many people will do the same values.
A sigh of relief that the next generation is not all bad. Good on you kid! Your on you're way to becoming a great man.
Love the saying” we should never judge book by its cover “
Oh my gosh, a hispanic teen is doing something good?! That is so mind blowing. WOW! I have so much respect for this young boy. What an icon for American teenagers.
I would have said “so yeah crazy huh? How bout I get your number and we get to hang out sometime, crazy day for the both of us huh? 😮‍💨
That is a good kid raised very well has my respect
They both baddies ngl
Absolutely love this. I really appreciate him as well.
I’m sure he peeked in tat hoe
Bless his heart
Mans just wanted to hit now he's rich
It’s great to realize it pays to be good .
He saw she was fine on her ID. Don’t hate the player, hate the game.
Big thumbs up for that kid!
🧡
Love to hear stories like this. Good job teen 👏🏾 🤗 Great bonus for having a good heart 🙏🏾
Repent of your sins  Believe that Jesus Christ is God Acknowledge He is Lord That He died for your sins  That He rose again on the third day That Jesus is the only way to heaven  Read the Holy Bible  And Love God as He has loved you.
Only if there were.more people in the hood like him
God bless him
I would have kept it. No one’s ever done anything for me. Just repaying society.
And then he got a 3 sum with the 2 women lol 😂
I would’ve gone to the management of the store or the police instead og straight to the person house u never know in what circonstances the person lost the purse. Thanks god everything went well great young man.
Amazing…what a fantastic young man!!!  That’s the kind of leaders we need! Bravo👏
thts cuz hes mexican  😂😂
Not everyone is a dush 😂😂
He saw the id saw she was cute🔥 he returned it thinking he will smash. That’s the real reason no need to cap 🧢
This is what I always teach my 10 yr old daughter. One day she picked up 100$ bill from a grocery shop and went straight to hand it to the store manager. I felt so proud of her😍
Wow nice
😂😂😂the girl on the DL is smoking hot thoe so likeeeee
Yeah she looks like the kinda girl who’d forget their purse
I had someone come looking for me with my locked cellphone and gave me a call! Like that was really kind
I've left my purse and phone in shopping carts on several occasions.  They were always turned into customer service
If anyone knows Melina, ask her to get her thyroid checked. I have graves disease and her thyroid is looking enlarged.
That’s more than the lady who returned $1,000,000 in cash got as a reward!
Dub foo 👏👏
Black mom be winning
W kid fr
Good job dude!
This is awesome...hope for young people.  He deserves it!
Awesome job good karma on the way
Love it. Pay attention kids!.. Karma and what comes around, goes around. Is pretty much life in general.
That's very nice of him tho well deserved:)
What an amazing young man!!! Truly an example for our youth!!!
Mom raised a good honest man. God bless him!!! It's nice to hear stories like this!
Good job my dude
It’s sad when doing what the hell anyone is supposed to do is celebrated
So proud of him, what a good young man ❤️
This is wonderful!  🏆
Nice boy ♥️
He’s 17 wearing chains and driving a 40k car what makes y’all think he woulda cared about the few hundred in her purse….. if he pulled up in a old clapper then this would’ve been impressive 😂 guess bro still went prob 10 mins outta his way to bring it back tho
Wonderful young man 🤩.  Integrity in a man is awesome and priceless! Love this.
I like his swag
Brother got a new chain on god
I envy them.  Whoever found my wallet didn't even wait a hot second before trying to charge whatever they could on my cards.   And it's unnerving knowing someone has all my IDs...
he fine as hell
That's beautiful! Yes baby! Always do good even when it's just you and God!
I was starting to wonder if the other woman could talk or not.
He would be judged by his looks, but he obviously has an amazing heart!!! Thank you ADRIAN RODRIGUEZ for “being the positive change” in the World!!! 🫶🫶🫶👏👏👏👍👍👍
Honorable
Right on!
he know wat he rlly wanted😂😂
God Bless him 🙏 always Stay safe God Blessing 🙏🏼
Interesting if this kid was seen on video taking the purse and not returning it, I can only imagine the amount of times he would be called out of his name, possibly called immigrant and be told he should return to his country! I’m glad he did the right thing as many do but don’t get noticed for it!
GTA side mission
That mother has raised a good young man that will be a great father some day. Well done young man.
And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. Colossians 3:17
Bro really wanted to shoot his shot
Good dude 👌
May God bless this boy❤️
Beautiful 🌟 young fella 😇💚💯 UK 🇬🇧 London
This is a great story!!
I would of been like oh yea. Shopping time.
I love this
Let’s be honest He only brought it back because he seen it probably didn’t have any money in it. Maneeeee let’s be honest
Politicians will steal that money by claiming taxes.
Bless him. Good education starts at home. He definitely is a good kid
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️
This is awesome! Great job, young man! 💜
This gives me an ounce of faith in humanity
He’s going to have some good karma his whole life godbless him
Salute to this guy for doing the right thing. 🫡
Finally some good news 📰 in like a decade lol 😂 great job 👏!
God bless this kid.
Good job young man, when you build your own family, pass on what your mom taught you to your children. God bless you.
He was hoping it belonged to a hottie
Just goes to show that people shouldn't judge others by the clothes they wear & the way they look🙏🏽❤️
There is still in some hope in this world after all
What a nice young man!
I love hearing stories like this. Sad many media outlets wont report it because it doesnt fit their narritive.
i woulda returned the purse if i seen her ID too  damn
Korrekter Typ
Plot twist he stole it.😂
That’s right lil homie
Look at his chains, he's already dealing drugs he has enough money already
Class act,all the way around, take notes fallow youngsters
Well… he’s at $14k now
Rare W
If I saw her picture on the ID, I’d try to go return it too. And I’d be really happy if her friend answered the door. Smart kid.
W mans
He stole it 😭
Honesty is always the best policy and like he said his mother taught him to always do what's right many blessings will be coming his way may God continue to bless him and his mother as well GREAT my young king
He’s a good guy 🙏🏼
I’ll go find someone wallets and return it to get a go fund me tooo 🤣🤣🤣
I did something similar……took items to persons home that were left in a mall parking lot….. I got the opposite reaction!  It’s nice that some people appreciate kindness.
Well dang can someone lose there purse again please😂
She should have gave him some food too wtf ☠️☠️
Finally! A young man from this milennia generarion who is honest.  I've alresdy lost my faith but this young man softened my heart.  There's probably 0.001% out there that do ha e good morales and principles.  My RESPECT to you  :--))
So awesome.  I'd do it for free but I wouldn't turn down cash. Lol. Good for you bud. Nice to see this.
God bless that teenager  he was raised great
Finally some good news in this crazy world....
great story  of what a  loving, respectful society looks like :)
👏🏻
unfortunately these stories will never become mainstream and only the worst of human kind will be selected by the capitalist white and zionist media so they can profit from more wars. dehumanization of a whole community(black) for the actions of few, but also disregarding the actions of the majority of the controlling community against the same community everyday in real life and white washing all their actions all the time indirectly
I love everything about this! 💕
Awesome
Awesome young man...May blessings follow him everywhere he goes..💛
You made mum proud!
If you want the world to be different, the change needs to start with you - the person in the mirror.
💜💜🖤🖤🖤🧡🧡💙💚💚🖤🖤🤍🤍🤍
BRO just found the woman hot n was tryina smash lol
He wanted some of that Mexican chili 🌶️ ;p
Kudos to this young gentleman 👏🏼 I wish all of the youth would have such integrity, but this young man is an excellent example!
May the LORD Bless you a thousand fold young man!! 🙏🏽🙏🏽
I returned a later wallet in the airport and a random customer gave me $100 for doing that
He is a blessing indeed, thanks to his mother....
Swaggy
Good job kid
Honest living. People find phones and try to keep instead of finding the owner. Be better
Finally news from America other than violence!
Wait.... actually a story of good people not the regular news of humans being horrible im amazed. All the news need more of this
Never judge a book by it's cover.
Very nice video!
I do good deeds like this and never get a reward but it’s okay since I do these things without expecting it regardless haha
Beautiful Story! ❤
Still good people in the world
he wanted to beat some cheex
🤍🤍🤍❤️❤️
That aint no boy thats a young man right there, with integrity. Much respect brotha 👊
I have too many people do that because sometimes people will be blaming other people for stealing their stuff even returns there purse when a guy lost his iPod he yell at me he was thinking I was going steal it even I Return it back to him
Always give benefit of doubt because if you judge by this kid's looks you would think otherwise
the gas money was prob more worth  💀💀💀
That’s a good thing he did most young men his age would have took everything that was inside the purse but he returned it without any problems 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Watched a video, before this one, about a young man in Orlando, Florida who was caught drinking vodka at a mall- to which the officer who caught him gave him a warning and just walked behind him as he exited to make sure he did in fact just leave the mall. Upon the final moments, the officer noticed a bag of marijuana sticking out of the young 19year-old's backpack he had on, told him to hand over the backpack for a search, and the young man ran ahead about fifty feet and turned around and shot at the police officer with a firearm the young man pulled from his backpack. The officer chased the young man, and eventually officers had to return fire at the young man who was firing upon them. He died from the incident, the body-cam footage has been released. "Orlando, Fl teenager at mall shoots at police and dies" smh. So it's heartwarming to see this positive content here! ❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏✊️✊️✊️
Wow that young man is going too be blessed 😇
He got to Hit and get 3k 👀👀👀👀👀
This is just set up to get a news story lol
I returned a purse once. I definitely didn't get news coverage and money
Wonderful family.   Great kid
🙏❤️😊
Faith in humanity....it's still there... Just not enough of it... good job young man
That's how we saposed to raise our kids ..my mom told me the same ....God bless that young gentleman 🙏
tyty
He got all this attention because he looks like a thug (no offense to him, he obviously isn’t) If he was a nerdy looking dude with glasses and a nice plaid shirt tucked in I wonder if the ladies would have rewarded him like this?
love this, he easily could've been profiled as the kind of dude to be the one taking the purse but he did the complete opposite. good job kid.
🖤
🫶🙏❤️Good Deed.😊
This is the kind of stuff that needs to be news!!
Very nice video!
Well done to you and your mom young man!
He restored my faith in humanity. God bless this young man. He's mom taught him right ❤️.
is it only me or this reminded me of gta 5
That’s her damn son
Law abiding citizen right there
well done young fulla
See and God blessed him and also he was raised right u go young man more blessing to come to u amen
I did something like that once. The guy was in such a panic until he got it back. He had all his money in that wallet and a cart full of groceries he was gonna have to leave behind without it. He told us he returned a wallet from a parking lot years earlier and it paid off. It could make or break somebody depending on your actions.
About 12 years ago I saw a wallet on the side of a neighborhood road while I was driving through. I stopped, reversed and picked it up. I continued on for a few minutes to my destination and there I opened it up. There was $941 in cash inside of it and a drivers license plus a few receipts. Nothing else. So I took the cash out and pocketed it and then put the wallet in a bathroom at a gas station. Thank god there weren’t ring cameras back then.
ughh not me who thought it was jay enhypen 😭💀🤡 but this message is inspiring and sweet ! ♡♡
My boy way tryna get him some Eliana
Everyone is writing " We need more people like him".  So you too dont wanna be like him?
I found a wallet in the grass by my apartment once. Ended up finding the person on Facebook and told him i found it. Turns out he was robbed and they took his phone as well so he was relieved to get his wallet back. Shortly after we became friends :)
I'm let's say interested in making even somehow finding money .. But if I knew who it belonged to with ID then I'd return it. But let's say hypothetically, if found cash or valuables without it ..I try to but hell no leave it somewhere with maybe maybe not " honest "establishment where I find it. I'm not quite that naive. I'd ask they provide a detailed description of what was lost . Sure not everyone knows exactly what they have on them at any given time but even somewhat close or no cigar buddy.
Respect
WOW 😲 What a Wonderful WONDERFUL Young-Man❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️ AMAN 🙃🙏🌹😍
Faith in humanity lost. A news story, thousands of comments praising him, and $14K for doing what anyone should do in that situation. Could also easily be a scam. Why didn't the women just give their own money to reward him instead of making a GoFundMe? Seems fishy. Either way, sad to see that this is seen as some larger than life act by the commenters here. You folks need to leave your house more often and experience the real world.
It helps that she looks like a freaking model. Id return a bubble gum wrapper if it had her picture and address on it….
Plot twist : he returned in case there was a chance that he would getting rewarded
Awee
He's the best guy
But he’s a “Thug” in many peoples eyes
Nah he jus saw her ID in the purse n wanted to smash lmao 💯
There is still honest people in this world.
That dude is a walking L . This a dog eat dog world take what’s yours people!
Hopefully he beat those cheeks too
I remember doing this never got a news story thoughb
More people like that
Once lost wallet in a theater and worker there returned it. I gave him a few bucks enough to eat somewhere . Least I could do. I didn't have much myself but had to reward him from what I had. It's not perhaps absolutely necessary but it's kind of nice to do.
Ngl my ass woulda taken the money and dropped of the purse w everything else 😂😅 but good for him
God Bless this young man
Awesome ❤️
Thank God for ppl like him!!
Right On👊🏽
To be honest, thats the first thing you should. It is excellent that a young man did the right thing.
prime example to never judge a book by its cover
420
An example of good parenting.
Cool guy with a great mother.
Well done 👍🏻
Good job young man
my mama always tought me steal as much as you can when no one is watching
There’s hope for our younger generation 😑🤓
respect for this young man, i hope more young folks can be like this young man!
Good job Mom and son. Hopefully he puts it to good use.
"Do the right thing when no one's watching" also *posted the doorbell video to social media ". Lol. Makes a lot of sense.
Hahaha I swear every body in California needs lip fillers 😂
Just cuz he looks like a crackhead you guys judge him
this video is sponsored by botox🤣🤣🤣🤣
Good mom, good son, good ppl all around.
Well they nailed character on the head, fashion...not so much. But who gives a fock!
Bless him tremendously
♡♡♡
Shouldn't the people just have given him a reward themselves instead of making a GoFundMe for other people to pay? Also, this is a good deed but I don't think it's worth the $14K. All hope is lost when THIS is such a highly praised deed. This should be expected.
They need to put a photo of this kid in the urban dictionary to describe what "cool" is. my god what an amazing guy.
What a wonderful young man! God bless you. Mom , hats off to you! You did a great job raising your son. That's nice of this family to reward him. 🙏🏽.
Nobody should have had to tell them to reward him. He did an outstanding GODLY  DEED and should have been automatically rewarded.  A great young man who others should model after.  Bless him.
Tear jerker 😢.  Good news makes me teary-eyed sometimes.         I'm still a gangsta tho  _If need be_
That foo seen the pic on id and was trying to hit.
Love this, God bless him 🙏🏼
Oh and how have the 🐦 never thought of redbeard & co while deciding to put security as invisivble as possible out there. No guns either. That person in charge of this...👎🏻
That’s a man who knows what goes come around goes around
Yes that only happends in America
...to always do the right thing even when no one is watching...that is very powerful, and a great guide in life
Girl, everyone isn't a theif he could've took what was in the purse.
Good man
Where is my price goddammit 🤣
Meanwhile my wallet gets stolen by a teenager
And have they 🐦 noticed that the boi slammin is wearing the clothes or at least jeans and shoes of mister redbeard?
I’ve given back 2 wallets and have gotten a door slammed in my face …..
W guy 🤎
real reason of returning: saw a hot spanish thot on the id
I did this a couple times actually, both times the ladies didn't even say thanks, snatched the purse out of my hands, and shut the door in my face. Wish I could come across decent people too.
This is awesome , so proud of him and so happy that you all were able to bless him as well.
This is awesome.
Fairplay to the kids mom
Wonderful young man, all the best  to him.❤️🎉🎉🎉🎉
👹❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Imagine what would have happened if the police drove by and saw him standing there with a purse...
Lol I do these great things all the time and it never makes the news or I get a reward but I’m glad he did lol it was like a payoff for all of us who do good things long as he is recognized for it makes me just us as happy 😊 somebody recognizes us young guys being respectful 🙏🙏 god bless
He's a good guy. His mom raised him right.
Mara bonsa WHT
What's the big deal? This is what I have always done... Never got money though, lol.
Way to go.  Wonderful young man.
My question is tho, how do you "forget" your purse in a shopping cart?🤔
Awesome!!
Why is this not the norm? ☹️ Everibody should act like that every day❤️
“There’s hope for our younger generation.”  Me: 🫠
aunty's fine
That boy made his mama proud! Way to go!
This is good parenting!
We need  more good stories like this that make you cry happy tears and restores your faith in people. 🕊️❤️
salute man
It was an investment
This young man was raised right.
See, doing the right thing isn’t difficult.
made me happy, made me smile
🔥🔥🔥🔥
This young man would have got a lot of satisfaction from returning the purse. Its very nice of people to reward him, and he will grow up better for the experience.
That aunt is fine tho
Is it normal in the US to park like their neighbors did??
What’s Eliana’s @? Lol
So cringey
💖
w mans
Great story!
Glad to see we also get these things shown in the Media. His Mom did raise him well.
Still hope left in this world...Fund raiser is about to pass 14k :)
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God
Dang all that and he’s cute, please slide him over
God bless this young man
When doing something normal is a headline news in America. It’s a good thing, but a news coverage? 😂
Bravo to him🇨🇦❤️
And honestly not being racist or anything but a lot of people "judge a book by its cover" and wouldnt look at him as someone that would do something like that. A lot of people would think he's some young wanna be thug type but really I respect what he did and wish there were more people like this!
That’s awesome 😎 🙏🏻
Good stuff!! Love it
What an inspiration
Superstar!!!!
Nice to hear positive news about teens. Well done to him for returning the Ladies purse.
They rode his kokk for a few minutes and got his wood pretty slime and wet!!
I thought to myself "his mama taught him to do the right thing" Turns out that's exactly what happened. 🥰
How sad that doing the right thing gets a YouTube video and a reward. We're all doomed!
Allah bless and guide this handsome young man.Ameen
maybe second time in human history!?
I'm pretty sure he got more than just a 3k reward if you know what I mean. Good for him
Youngest nicest thug on the block
That’s real nice of the young fella
Hopefully he will really get the money.
He clearly saw the ID and said “😍🚗💨”
Good job!! They're still good in the world☺💕
i´m glad for the kid, but it´s sad that  this kind of things goes viral when is something that should be normal
Good job mom 👏👏👏 such a great young man ✌️
That's pretty solid.   They hardly make em like that anymore.
Your mom must be very proud. He raised you well. Good job, son! You're the man.
shid I would've returned that purse too I'm trying holler at shawty she fine af
Mannn this made my eyes  water up💧 for some reason
Love this so much in these hard times
That was epic is doing survey scams and if you try to warn people they delete your comments. They steal your info and sell it online
As mess up as this is going to sound the police will still look at him as a criminal based on his attire good to see young kings doing good things
Good kid raised right. Goes to show appearance isn't everything.
“When asked why he went out of his way to return the purse” so what is he supposed to do, leave it?
RESPECT TO THAT KID!
I found a teenager’s wallet with $250, his Driver’s License, his Tesla key card, and his debit cards. I returned it to the family and his mom tried no joke tried to give me $3… i was like no thank you fine and left. I wasn’t even expecting a reward in the first place. But $3 is just insulting.
His mom raised him right!
🖤🖤🖤
I would return that too so I could see these women lmao
Looks like a Telfar too
Wait what was inside?  •tampons •nail glue •takis •gum •one used sock •one used Q-tip •hot sauce •vibrator •picture or your mom •zero dollars
The fact he did it for a good cause. Still a video gets captured, featured, viewed by millions....nothing is a coincidence.
See respect to this kid.
We should encourage this behavior
That’s a sweet baby !!!
Daym he’s fine AF too I wonder if he’s single
He was just trying to clap cheeks in return.
love his mum teaching , love how he choose to listen
bro took 15 dollars for gas money💀
He is an awesome young man.
Good man 👍
Thanks for returning my sister’s purse
Quandale Dingle
God bless ya Kid.
Those women were milfs I would have taken a non monetary gift lol
He did the right thing
We don’t need hope for the future generations. They always do good deeds. Media rarely covers it though. Bad news sells more.
my dawg seen dat id 🤣 n said he wanna future w you 💍
Good people win
Another Adrian ftw
don't judge a book by its cover
We need more good news.
Respect! I once forgotten my wallet at a clothing store (PacSun) at one time and it was filled up with hundreds of dollars. I left it in one of the fitting rooms and while we left, the person came running out of the store to find me and just like in this video, they could have kept it but I hope wherever that person is now, I hope they recieve infinite amount of good and positive karma from that situation! (It was a very long time ago, I think like 2013 lol)
Such integrity from a kid that most would probably stereotype for the way he looks. He definitely could have taken it all and went on with his day but he took the extra steps to make sure she got her belongings back and that speaks such volumes. In the same situation how many can really say they would do the same?
Thanks god he was able to deliver that bag safely to that house, if he was caught by police on the way while trying to do the right thing he probably in jail by now, it happens believe it or not
Raise your kids right and instill in them good character and teach them and develop these principles to do what is right In God’s eyes.. He’s one of the few who doesn’t need to record his good deed to be seen. Bible says to do good deed in secret and not for an applaud by the world.  Props to the mom raising her son.
What a remarkable young man!!! We need yo many more humans like this!!
3k and I'm sure he'll get a real reward on his 18th birthday lol from one of those single ladies
Well very uplifting.
Hey saw her ID and wanted to hook up.
Probably was hoping to hit
this is pretty much a given in my country. lmao. Most people will go out of their way to return someones belongings... I feel so bad for america. and alot of other countries where lawlessness grows day by day.
What happen too the real news
🔥
The purse had the key to the cocaine drawer.
Sadly todays acts of kindness has to be recorded, true acts of kindness is never for fame, you just do it unconditionally.
I don't carry purses,  that man should have been given a million bucks for being put on video holding that purse like that. LMAO
Good heart that young kid has .only if everyone was like him it would be a better world. Amen 🙏
well it's rare to find someone like that nowadays cos we're living in a gangsta paradise now hehe.
If they would have caught him with the purse even if he wanted to do the right thing to return it back the situation would be different so I'll just stay away from helping someone
My dad found a wallet with a stack of folded large 💵 at least 2 inches thick in a mall parking lot when I was a teenager and I remember driving around looking for the address (no gps back then) for what seemed like hours in an upscale neighborhood in Jersey. We found the house and it was an elderly couple, they tried to give my dad money but he wouldn’t take it cause he was a prideful man then they told him he should hurry up and leave cause they got scared and called the cops when we approached the door 🤷🏻‍♂️ .  A couple of days later my father got a cashiers check in the mail from some legal firm representing the elderly couple with an apology and a thank you . Don’t ask me how they got our address and name cause till this day that’s always been a mystery , I’ve always assumed it was through the license plate numbers
🙌
Angel in disguise! 😇
i have been this honest here in india.. well. no one cares here.. great video though
Love this
Awesome young man
Good for this dude.  He definitely did a great thing. When I was his age I don't think i would've done this bc I was a stupid 17yr old.  But this kid shows his maturity and he deserves any reward he gets.
Why does the second girl look like azzyland? And good job to the boy, he earned that money
Don’t judge a book by its cover! Brings a tear to my eye
that g thng
Can she give the guy a date or something my chicano brother represented us in a very respectful admirable way.
I woulda came back later 🤣🤣
man is doing gta side missions lmao
true bloke
He did the right thing. A good young man!!
That was his girlfriend, not ot a random person
The world will be a better place if we have more good people like this out there. God bless this guy man
Damn he’s about to get all the girls 😜
Good man, Adrian !!!
parent teach him good kids
Good parents
His Momma is proud of him, I don't know him, I'm proud of him
See like I say it starts in the home raise them right
Funny how it's a normal behavior in most country (that I know) but in America it is so unusual that you get 3K$.
The gofundme ist currently sitting at $13,882. Still going.
I saw a California license and immediately turned it in to the police station. Glad this kid returned the purse.
Amen, thank God 🙏🏽
It's nice and all, but... This kind of thing should NEVER be newsworthy. This SHOULD be something that you do anyway. It shouldn't be such a rare event that it bucks the trend, that it's so extraordinary, so way out there. A simple act of kindness that should be human nature makes it onto the news shows what a dark place society has sunk to.
Job well done from parents
God  Bless Him
That was so awesome 👍👍 there's not many people like that god bless him
Most likely some will probably think negatively about him. But the saying goes don't judge the book by the covers. You'll be surprised to know many have a good heart. Be the Change you  want to be seen. And the world will followed
I did this once to return some ones wallet...had 250 in cash with cards...unforunately..it never made Inside Edition
He wouldn't have returned it of it had 3k cash inside
This is the reason why we dont judge the book by its cover.. look like negative person from outside but rich with positive humanity behind personality.. respect and may god bless u bro..
i hope the dude have a good life
It’s shocking and noticeable because he looks like he lives in the hood and people don’t think a hood/geto person would do this
The world needs more young men like this!
That's awesome.
So proud of him!👍
Nah bro shorty was looking cute In her driver’s license he came ready to get the number as a reward
This guy "How do I turn $80 and a purse into $3,700?" Lol jk good on the guy
Go fund me is at $13,882. God blesses integrity.
he hot asf. what’s his socials?
That's so sweet
hahaha there is a hope for younger generation, sounds really pessimistic. Pretty sure there is no hope in the future.
Great job young man!
That’s very nice, there is still some hope
Dude, you should have just went off with that.
Congratulations to this young man for doing the right thing! Without even expecting a reward, he got one anyways.
What’s the go fund me account? I wanted to contribute as well!
Big Respects 🏆🫡💯💯
I’ve done a lot of good deeds and we should never expect anything but back but damnit come on! Lol
Awesome young man! Kudos to his mom!
why they gotta say his government name on broadcasting
Great job young man!!
🔥🔥🔥
Faith in humanity improoved. thank you young MAN. I'm so proud of you.
3k is not bad at all
The lady's were cute
they have raised around 13,000 now
There’s hope?
Allah is always watching good job brother
Very nice
Lol
Good kid, needs to leave that hell hole he lives in. California is a cancer.
Humanity Still Alive 🤍
That's wonderful 😊.
Who has the go fund me link?
Dude stole it then returned it tf
STAGED, HE RETURNING TO HIS OTHER MOM FOR THE REWARD LOLZ!
🙏 Good job bro 👏👏👏 salute!
Моё почтение
That’s nice. Considering he stole it. Probably took it, got what he wanted, then he got paid for stealing. Fake
Why’d she have the other girl’s driver’s license?? Really suspicious….
God bless this young man, need more of this in the world 💯 there is still good in our 🌎
Looks like an thug, has an heart of an angel
Jesus Christ is the way the truth and the life John 3 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
thats integrity. Not expecting anything in return speaks more volume than the act itself.
God Is Good 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽God bless that young man and his Mother’s teachings. Proverbs 22:6
We need more people like this kid
Lol like I will take that purse back in this wicked economy   lmao🤣 . I wi go ghost mode on their stupid asses.
What a legend.
We have good people and bad people. But it depends on who you wanna be.
We will go thur alot in this world.  Temptation, greed but this young man over come all this. Praise to the parents and this young man will go far impacting this world. 🙏👏
Let's go Adrien Rodriguez. Great story.
....good parents....good children.... there is no rocket science....but this is tradition fast fading in US and west...
What a amazing kid. Kudos and God protect you every day. Proud of you young man 🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️
Eliana is very beautiful
W mans
Young man , you can Date my Daughter . Don't think I have to worry at all. YOU have a conscience 👍🙄
Its shocking that society thinks this is exceptional behavior. This is normal human empathy at work.
He’s fine and kind 😍 ufff
mans got 6 million views for returning a purse lol
What goes around come back full circle
Great!....proud of him!
Perfect for start of porn movie
Actually this should not be special but normal !!!
Dios lo bendiga siempre 😘
It was 10k+ dollar reward since the lady set him up a go daddy fund me page
Its not all about the money,boy did a good deed,should ask her which one still available
3k?
Nice job young man
Is there video of them giving him the money?
God bless this young man abundantly!! We need more young people like him. His mother sure did a wonderful job bringing him up. Parents, please do the right thing for your children. You will be saving them and helping the world.
Nice of the kid to do this but what a screwed up country we live in when we make such a big deal over something so routine that’s capitalism for you. It’s created this kind of society wake up zombies and takeoff your mask while you’re at it
That’s a man to marry!
$3000 just enough to cover gas
Lovely. Just lovely.
"Do the right thing, even when no one is watching." God bless that mother, shes is a great lady! God bless the boy, he has a good heart.
He did this out of the kindness of his heart and because he knew it was the right thing to do. Not because he thought he would get something out of it. This component is missing in a lot of our society today.
Nice 👍
I love this
Don't let appearance fool you, but let good actions speak.
She gotta give me some top after that 😂
His parents gave him the Audi and he would have kept the change in the purse for getting around in a bus if things weren't so easy
My man was tryna to smash 😂
It’s so rare to find a decent human being  in California that this makes the news! Here in small town American it’s just normal!
Good people in this world 🙏🏿
Mom taught him to do the right thing even when no one is looking. He didn't have to take that advice when most of the world is against him. She must have taught him alot of other good lessons on humanity and citizenship.  That is a person any company could trust completely.
🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙏🏿
As soon as I saw the women I knew daym well why he wanted to return it🤣😭
ayy mans got the same name as me
Well I’m now going to go around looking for lost purses
Cool kid
God please give this man blessings through out his life
He’s beautiful as well as a good boy ❤️❤️❤️❤️
And he got drip. I like that . 🔥🔥🔥. God bless you young boy.
Salute to this young man 💪
🥹🥹❤️
YES,  HOW  SAD  THAT  WE  'HAVE'  TO  BE  SO  SURPRISED  AND  CONGRATULATE  SOMEONE  WHEN  THEY  ONLY  DO  THE  RIGHT  THING!     A  THOUSAND  THANKS  TO  THAT  MOTHER  WHO  INSTALLED  GOOD  PRINCIPLES  AND  VALUES  IN  HER  SON!  ("IF  IT'S  NOT  YOURS,  IT  MUST  BELONG  TO  SOMEONE  ELSE;  IT MUST  BE  RETURNED  TO  ITS  OWNER"!).    THAT  IS  THE  BEST,  GREATEST,  VALUABLE  AND  MOST  IMPORTANT  INHERITANCE  THAT  PARENTS  SHOULD  LEAVE  THEIR  CHILDREN!
When u make good recibe good
Yeah all u people talking y'all know dang well if it was 3 gs cash in that bag u ant returning it stop capin people and ant no such thing as good or bad that's the human perception talking. it was made up to controll everyone don't believe it it's true
His parents should be so proud of him. He will have a happy family. God Bless you Adrian
Good thing to see their parents (or mom) did a GREAT JOB!
Wonderful story, thanks for sharing it
He is handsome too
well dont to  him as it should be congratulating him on a great job top marks from  me
Good job Adrian.
VERY COOL KID
Dont judge a book by its covers
It is up to $14K now, good for him!
Who leaves a Berkin at walmart
Was that a birkin
Imagine just being nice and sincere nowadays is considered a really rare things to do. What a world we live on. If we set a good morale compass for ourselves, i believe doing good deeds is just a normal and a must thing to do.
He did what his mother taught him. The🌎 needs more parents like her.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Don't say, "we want more people like him" instead of just try to BE a person like him. XO
kudos to his parents must've been so proud raising him
Plot twist : he took all the money then returned it
He can now buy a tank of gas
💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾 awesome parents... awesome kid.
Always do the right thing when no one is or is not watching. Remember God is always watching.
🙌🙌🙌
Love it
Dope
He probably was the one who stole it
The sad part is that people probably look at him thinking he was no good because of how he looks & dresses . But clearly this proves that clothes & looks don’t mean anything , I love seeing good things like this ❤
His nickname could be AROD
Amazing I hope this boy can be and example to many
Brought up the right way.
Good to see some values in use by our younger generation!
Stop it 85% of kids tht have a car would return it
What a great guy. Well raised.
actions like this needs to go viral our youth needs a good way to steer to
👏🏽👏🏽✊🏾
It starts with one person at a time! 💪🏾
Awesome guy his mamma is proud👍👍👍
Wow we need more like him 🥺
that mother raised that young man correctly! she should be proud. and he should be proud of himself he is a wonderful man.
I'm young so respect for this guy.
He got over $10,000
Boy 17 with a Audi? lol yeah he didn’t need the money
Whata REAL MAN Bro..! Keep the faith!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💪🏽💪🏽
I raise my four young kids every day with common sense it looks like Adrian‘s mom did the same thing with him.
God Bless Him Amen xxxxxxx and God Bless His Earthly Family Amen xxxxxxx
Allah Sees everything
If she was fat n ugly would he have taken the purse back......?
There’s good people still excited in this world
That’s really awesome!❤️❤️❤️
The go fund me is now over 13,000 dollars. Wow
🥰🥰🤗
I'm so happy they rewarded him. He's an amazing man.❤
if there was more then 3k in there he was being stupid
Respect for this dude not many people would return it
Please do more of this people
Young man raised right but he made the decision on his own. Awesome to see people do the right thing.
👍👍👍👍✊✊✊✊❤❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏🙏🌹🌹🌹🌹💎💎💎💎
Shieet I've saved adults and kids life on a beach where I work at here in Bahamas and never received a dime from those I saved nor from their parents🤣🤣🤣🤣 I be more happy to save lives though, keep your money, God got me👌🏿
Damn I’ll make sure to return a lost purse next time
Need a son..🤣🤣😆
It's up to $14,000 now! 🤣
Not all heroes wear flashy capes. The ones in California flashes their underpants.   Respect
😱😱😱😱😱😱
😱😱😱😱😱😱
Good for you young man 🤘🤘
I would love to do something dirty to those two women
“Always do the right thing when no one is watching” damn right! This is wholesome af!!!
Ask you’re selves what would you would of done ? Also never do a good deed to get reward from the ppl etc reward comes from above ☝️🤲
Its good to know that the woke culture, who aims to dismantling our tradition and values was not yet absorbed in the mind of this teen.
I'm all for this but it's sad that just because somebody does the right thing they get put on TV?
Like they say, no news is good news. Hence why you don't hear of this all the time. Good lad. Done your family proud there.
Goddamn sad that this is a news report. I remember the days this was concidered normal, and you didn't get 3k. Wtf!
Bless this dude, hes the right example!
Or he's homies the guys that stole it and just finessed their asses lol
Sus
Solid kid
Aww bless him 💓💓
protect him plz
This is great, but it's also sad how negatively positioned this video is... how the expectation is that he would just steal it and the surprise that he didn't.. and that a good deed needs rewarding with cash. It's just a bit sad that we seemingly live in a world where this is 'newsworthy behaviour'.. If you ever manage to do something like this and go out of your way to help somebody, having them say thank you and be happy is good enough reward.
Well done he did the right thing 👏 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
karma is real....
Surprisingly a gang gang looking kid did a good deed 👍🏻 I commend him for that
His parents have done an amazing job raising him with honesty, kindness, compassion, dignity and respect 🙌 This young man is an excellent example of how all people should be no matter your age
Melina, I think you need visit dokter, it might something happen with your tyroid, I knew because I been there before,God bless:)
Wow!!!! What a great young man. And what great parents of this Great young man. He warms my heart. And the parents never gave up. I am also a parent and there’s many times I just wanted to say, “fine do what you wanna do!”. But I didn’t. I never gave up on my kids. Even when I was exhausted. Just like these parents never gave up on this Great young man. I love the story
Bless him!  His mother didd a great job raising him.
This is how we will be raising our son. This is wonderful
Happiness does come in all forms, I'm so moved to tears that this young man listened his mom and did the right thing. He does deserve so many blessings--- being on video for returning the bag that he found plus the handsome reward that people have given him. Awesome!!!
Plot twist, he’s the one that stole the purse in the first place.
This is gonna sound terrible but I'm really happy this kid didn't get pulled over with that goddamn pocketbook.  The police wouldn't have listened to a single thing he said
Kind acts like this should be the norm. Sadly it's not.
Found a wallet many years ago. Did some search on the internet and found his address and phone number.  I met him and gave him his wallet back. He was very happy about that.
It's not about "we need more people like him" it's about you being that person. Have a great day.❤️
Hat's off to you young man! You made your parents so proud!❤
Awesome guy! I wish there was more people like him in the world.
@foosgonewild new foo unlocked the justice foo
A young man with class! Let's not forget the real star of the show here, his mother!
"Character Is Destiny." -Heraclitus
How embarrassing for the aunt, you know,  the one who was too greedy to show appreciation at the moment (or even pay for gas money!)  without having to be pressured by social media... 💜💕WHAT AN AMAZING KID!💕💜
😭😇
the guy W
It's hilarious that someone not stealing something makes the news and gets a fund raiser. Well done to that lad for being like the hundreds of millions of other people in the world who don't steal. Someone give him a medal and organise a meeting with the president 🙄
He looks like some street gangster, just with different goals
Thief's be returning the purses with just credit cards and cashing back ... 💲💲💲💸💲💲💲
Well done 👏
I've been so tainted by the internet a small part of me can't help but suspect foul play.
Parents advice your kids to do d right thing!!!. Everyone do d right thing please 🙏!!!.
Why he Returned? For one there Was no goddamn cash in it, not even a cell phone. But she looked kinda cute on this photo and i thought if i return this we can have a romantic night together hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
they better let him hit
hope he could buy belt after that.
Respect A-Rod!  Raised right by your Mama.  Its not hard to do the right thing if you've the strength of character & a good moral compass to guide you in the right direction.  Love these feel good stories.
❤️🙏🏽
lol a woman losing something is a news story
He needs to get that girls digits!
Mad how tyou think this behaviour isn't standed behaviour by anyone. why people think this is extraordinary is nuts. Would 95% of us do this. Your perception is fuked
If the purse carried 10k in cash, then it would be a different story.
Perfect 😊
This was awesome, I wish the world could have more people like him, however, it makes me think how bad is the situation in the world right no. When someone do something good, act with kindness it immediately turns into a big deal and ended up in the news.  It seems like the new normal is to be a bad person and we get surprised with the least act of kindness and honesty.
Respect.
Jesus loves you
Wow botox
Good lad. How proud his family must be.
I am myself same as name as the teenager. And my mother told us also always do the right thing even no one's watching. I myself return a breitling watch that i found and it cost more than 7000€ watch.
if he was a white dude, he would got like nearly a million dollar if not more LMAO
"even when no one is watching" 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 That woman can educate !
Wow such a great guy He must be proud so should his family 😊😊😊
Finally there’s hope in our Raza. Positive vibes all around. 👍👍
He probably seen how fine she was took the purse and took it straight to her 🤗
The did 3some for sure
why suprised? its normal, thats the brotherhood
Am I the only one who feels like he could’ve took it and then played it off this way…?
What a great man.
Salute!
Awesome gesture all round👍
Adrian Rodriguez we need more good people in the world like you. God bless brother 🙏🙏🙏
He wanted that lol
Another "feel good" story. Great
he his so cute...Yes mama Raised him well....thank you son for your honesty
is he riding an Audi?? If yes he doesn't need that 3 grans, but he deserves to be famous as a role model for young adults. Kudos to you kid!
why people keep say "we need more people like him" we don't need more people like him We must be like him not other people
What if Tyrone found the purse??
Lol
It's unfortunate that good deeds make it to the news. What a sad time we live in
Bien echo
and he fine… yea that’s my man
My boy got that SSN , copy of the ids and birth certificate, maybe even card numbers he running it up fasho he don’t need the petty money cuz need the whole thing lol 😂 orrrr he could of been doing the right thing
I've done this with wallets, and I phones, and never got anything... BUT just like this kid, it's not what your gonna get out of the good deed, it's doing the right thing!!!
So proud of this young man!
i guess that just made him 10x cute cute
17 just like me he wasn’t expecting money most likely but this can help him with a car if he doesn’t have one already other than that respect to that him ‼️
It's impossible to not respect this. A real life legend
To me he just looks like an honest person.  He's going to be great working for someone's company or his own
Don’t think that was all he was looking for
*Tears*
That young man was raised right.! That's what's up! Way to go bro! 👏 Enjoy your big reward kid. 👍
Great young man! Any update on Ghislane Maxwell list?
So nice 🙏🏾🙏🏾😍🤍😇
So doing something normal is that rare that you talk about it in the news? Poor world
Amazing young man! I hope he never changes! I do wish though the end included a clip of them surprising him with the money
That’s awesome
Forgive me everyone but ……… that lady looks like a snack ….oh and yea kid did great 😊😂
good that he returned it. but a bit sad that this kind of a good deed seems like a spectacle nowadays.
God bless🙏🏼🌹🙏🏼🌹
Honesty and kindness seem to be on the endangered species list lately  Nice to see that it's not completely extinct in the younger generation  God bless the young man for his good deeds  I wish him good fortune and happiness in all of his endeavors  Just saying
I found a phone on the bus around a month ago, did my best to track down the owner & give it to her. When i did locate her & tried to give her the phone back she was acting a little rude & was ungrateful, didn't even bother to say Thank You...I wasn't turning her phone in for a reward or nothing like that but because i know how it feels to lose a phone.
your momma is proud g!
Good job  👏🏾 young man and kudos to his mother for raising a kind and responsible young man. Best wishes to him and his future.
Respect for the guy :) Sure he appreciates the funds... I personally think that money is the worst reward cause it teaches you money rules the world (to me time and appreciation is a better reward) have the family around for a BBQ and you might make a more profound change
my man thought that lady was hot and was hoping to get a different reward.
Homie was trying to chop
We live in a world where a normal human act is considered heroic😄
Hope I’m raising mine the way his is!!!
awesome
What a great story.
Amazing
Nice young man raised with good values.
Woah the first ever guy to return a purse
Sorry, if I'ma be the only one saying this but um. Her friend is fine lmao ;)
he fine
Last night I found a contactless bank card. Found woman online and and going to post through her letterbox this morning.  I won’t be getting a reward or anything. It’s just the right thing to do.
He wanted them digits hook a brotha up
❤️this is why men>
Honestly I pretty much had it with people saying oh this generation this, this generation that. You're raising them idiots.
W Teen
What a good guy 🔥✨🙌🏼
Not all heroes where capes
I did this a couple months ago, cash and everything.
Bro hit a lick on the purse and brought it back and came up on a bag
We all know why he wanted to bring that purse back😏
*Not all heroes wear capes.*
I reckon he just seen a hottie on the photo....that's why he did it 🤣
We just don't need someone like him, be like him folks
Great brother ❤️💯
Fixed
Wow this thug was trying to get their address/info to steal identity, come back and rob the house!!! They’re lucky to be alive honestly, probably cuz of the 3k bribe
♥️♥️♥️
we all know y he returned it
And I can remember times when returning lost things was considered standard behavior.
Did they let him hit?
This just shows that this kind of right behaviour is apparently kind of rare there, isn't it?
God bless this Youth!!!👏👏
W little cholito 🙏
God bless his mother for teaching him to love his neighbor as yourself.  Bravo young man..
God bless this man🙏he’s an inspiration. May kids watch and be like this,great things happen when food
Story goes on they invite him over for q dinner party n they all got faded n whoops woke up together that would've awesome after he turned 18 that is
God bless him ☦️🙏🏻
❤️‍🔥💜
Awesome!! :)
Wow a civilized young man, I’m amazed. I can’t believe someone has the decency not to steal at any given opportunity, he should be rewarded with more money.
Homie was trying to get lucky 😭
Yeah i just lost my 700 bucks last week
I was gunna make a joke about this dude pulling up in an Audi but now I just feel mean
💯
plot twist: he maxed out the credit card in the purse before returning it and they're only finding out about it after they gave him 3.7k lmak
That happened to me, but wit my sisters wallet, and the guy who brought it, woke me up, so caught me super off guard and I didn’t give him anything in return, and we don’t have a ring camera, but it was so sweet of him to bring it all the way.
Bravo to this kids parents
His pants werent raised right though. 🤣
really the only notable thing about this is that he's not white. if I did this no one would care.
His parents raised this young man right
This is pretty awesome. From the looks of it thats a 2k + bag so props to this kid.  Just goes to show u should NVR jusge a book by its cover
This Video Puts a Smile On My Face.
oh he fine😋
We'll meet again after the next pandemic my friends!
yeah we need more people like him he was raised rt
Man knew he was going to get a reward. Not a fully altruistic deed.
Bravo 👏🏽 Gracias Señora, his mama taught him values, respect, honesty✅🙏🏽. 💯 %
He was trying to smash after he seen the I.d
Wow this man is an amazing life saver. If I lost something and somebody brought it back I would had been so appreciative and happy. And this man has restored a little faith in humanity.
You’re truly a life saver Dr Igudia on YouTube.I’m now living a very comfortable life after using your herbs medication to cure my genital herpes infection completely
Mom teaching always correct in whatever condition position And situation.. Become to be good Samaritan..
Let's face it. If he is a average white kid, there won't be this reward and hype.
Never judge a book by its cover.
Not only has he received a cash reward, but this will also be great for getting a job or getting into college, what a wonderful thing to have on the internet when someone Googles him
Wow great young man. Good on him :)
He deserves it!! Thank you for being a good person!
NICE, GREAT YOUNG MAN!
Good job sport may god bless you. It starts at home🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Bros tappin both of em
So these two woman still making money on name of this man
Kid has a bright future.
Ok. So what happens is. They take the purse. Come up on it. And then they go and return it in hope for reward money. Obviously. Either or i hope it was a good deed. God bless.
The whole three in on it scam views
Good man you guys raised
Ooh bless ur heart 4 being a gud person! Wow! We need mor young ppl lyk him! Whoever raised u has dun a gr8 job! Be blessed more abundantly in return!

Don’t judge a book by its cover ☝🏽
Id be afraid to receive three thousand dollars
Do good deeds an good karma shall return 💯
Good job, young man! 👏Well-deserved. 💸
He's fineee asffff too👁👁
He did a great job !!!!!
Still good people I would do same
I see a fund raiser already being made up for him for $10k.i can see it now.
Anyone can do the right thing when being watched, good stuff kid!
Good kid
I lost my phone in a all Mexican area with a lot of crime .I was thinking so bad of whoever found it and kept it for themselves .But it turns out an old Mexican lady found phone on a empty shopping cart where I left it .She brought phone inside and left it with store manager .This kind act made me change my attitude towards people in this area .It was life changing for me .I cannot be judgemental towards others because the color of their skin .I feel the hand of God touching my heart .
this kid has potential to end dhar mann's career
hell yeah!
The guy drove an Audi? Sure, he didn’t need her wallet or the $3k.
Real g frfr
thank god we have mothers these days that teach their children SOMETHING.
W
Good kid. Bt I thought it's normal thing to do
Why’s the ‘boy really fine
If you Had alot of Blessing these past years, SHARE IT..Simple logic for a low person like me........God blesses you more than you deserve so you Can SHARE it to more ubfortunate People
👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
only in on tv in real life.  The woman will call the police and say, "he stole it in the first place!!"
Oh He Got Her Digits For That "###-####" 😂😂😂
I would fine the same 😉
Who care you just wasted 3 minutes of my life i will never get back haha
I am the same 🙏🏻
Wow, this has sparked hope in gen-z generation. Humanity needs people like this.
Good young man he was raised right all good people may God bless them all
They should have adopted him...
Nice
"don't judge a book by its cover" my man that's a big W for you and you deserve it!  🤜🤛
I love it!!!!
This GTA I only get 300 back
he definitely got to pipe both
A good lesson for the youth God bless you brother
17 year old driving a brand new Audi returns $50 purse and gets $3000. Heartwarming
Bros just starting gta and doing side quest so he can go to the casino so he can  do the rdr2 challenges so he can do 3x cash jobs so he can get 2.2$ million dollars so he can by kostaku so he can grind caso perico heist so he can by an oppressor and apartment
Bro saw the id and had to give his shot
God bless you all!  God bless Adrian! and his mom!
Dimucc
Good kid
He is going get so much coming back to him!
Yeah you'd be shocked how many people won't do this stuff just because it's "None of their business." Like, yeah, if you cannot find the owner in that circumstance then fair enough, but you should at least try.
I did this with a wallet I found in the grocery store bring it to his house he gave me 50$ and I was happy AF at the time I was broke af so I can't lie I looked at all the cash in the wallet a few times before I returned it haha 🤣
Applause for that young man..
Wonderful in Jesus name 8
damn she’s so fine to. def would return the bag
And the thing is, many people will look at him and judge him by the way he dresses and call him a thug. Just another example of NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S COVER. You never know what goes on in somebody's heart just by looking at them. You don't know a person just by what goes on on the outside. Good on you Kid. We need more people like you in the world. Thanx Inside Edition for posting some positive news stories that actually give us hope for this generation and in humanity as a matter of fact.
Plot Twist
Hell yea give Rodriguez a good rep!
Mom 👩 thought their son a honest and humble way to help others  in needs .😇🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏👍
We need more people like this person
Very good kid!! Good things will come to him always
Stanleymov
His mom raised him right!! That’s the kind of young man I’d approve with my own daughter !! Well done!!!!
Aweee sweet baby 🌸💖💖
His decision and his action speaks positive volumes about him, AND His MOM !! All around great real-life story.
"Train up a child in the way he should go; and when he is old, he shall not depart from it."
Speaks a ton about the parents raising a fine young man too!
Literally done this twice but with three wallets an 1 cell phone I found In the middle of the road an I got nothing but a thank you twice an cash once unfortunately.
Up to 13 thousand now
Lucky him! Too often no good deed goes unpunished.  I found a purse in a cart just like he did, and it was wide open at the top and you could see a lot of money in the smaller purse inside, and so I took it back into my work even though I'd worked all day and was tired from heavy lifting, but no one was at the customer service desk, so I took it to the mgr office because I wanted to leave, and when I came back from the office, I heard the woman telling the desk lady about how she left her purse in her cart outside, and so I ran back to the office and brought it to the desk, and the desk lady yelled at me for taking the purse to the back and the customer never said thank you and glared at me!!!  THE NERVE!!!  When she did that, I said you're welcome!  I told the shrew at the desk later that she knew it was outside and I'd brought it in, and her actions showed she doesn't have very good comprehension skills!
GOD IS GOOD REPENT DIOS VIENE DIOS ES BUENO ARREPIENTANSE DIOS LOS AMA ABLALE AL SEÑOR SPEAK TO THE LORD HE LOVES YOU ❤️!!!!!—-
Good for him.
Wow very rare especially at that age. Godbless you and many blessings young man. You should give him a few hundred!
Very nice video!
His mother raised him right, nice to finally see some good in people. Great job young man!👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
He did the normal thing
Everyone says we need more people like him but no one says "I" need to be more like him.
High sock activity 👍🙏🏻
*thinks about ma* i got this deed😈
Great up bringing by his mom.....GOOD JOB MOMZ!
My boy was just tryna hit LMAO
Homie should've clapped
Once I did this and I got the cops called on me and I was handcuffed and they let me go about an hour later lol
Very hard to see such teenagers nowadays......respects to his parents.
God bless him, but she basically got robbed all over again 😭😭
Amazing story
This is wonderful!!
Omg they called her older?!?
Thanks for being appreciative
His parents must be so proud 👏 great models for everyone to follow
Lol dats my name. Wish it was me :P
Scam.
Future parents… PLEASE RAISE YOUR KIDS RIGHT
🤔 GOOD PARENTING GOES A LONG WAY 👍
Legendary bro his parents did a great job raising him.
That's what I've always taught my kids to do the right thing
She should have gave my dude a beej.
I did this before I got 10 dollars😅
what a lovely young man!
NEVER judge a book by it's cover.
Yeah she does seem a bit forgetful xD
In the thumbnail, he looks like a guy who smokes and steals items from convenient store. Don’t Judge The Book By It’s Cover
He’s so fine 😭
Why she reminds me of Cardi-B!!!… so much 😂
& he’s cute 😏😏
What a gentleman 👏🏼
love seeing stuff like this
was that a botega purse ?
What a guy
Much props to this young man for demonstrating how everyone should be...a good person from the heart. The fact that this is so shocking today defines the sad sign of the times.
But his hat on backwards, he has a gun, stop resisting!!!
That is so nice of him we need more people like him 🥰
bros fine asf
He was lowkey tryna bone
This should be what we see on the news.
Dang drove 70 miles to return a phone and not even a thank you lol
Wow that’s amazing & nice
Poo
Good Job Dude
👍🏿💯💯
He did a good thing, We know why he wanted to return that purse to smash them both baddies
His mom should feel very proud.
Aww that’s so respectful man and many blessings to him 🙏
"At the _guerocery_ store"
She looks like Zhavia's mom
What well raised kid... I only wish the best of things in life for your young man with strong integrity
Awsome what a awsome guy doing the right thing !
There is hope for the future. 🖤 good kid.
That’s called integrity. 🙌🏻👏🏻
Good job young man mad respect 🙏
he’s fine lemme leave my purse somewhere 😭
Honestly eliena could’ve just took me out to dinner 😍
Flame of Fame💪🔥
Lucky a latino found it, if it was one of those "outstanding BLM citizens ", this wouldn't be in the news .
Amen
Fine young man😭
He’s kinda cute
Props homie 👏
All I can say is God bless this young man, and thank you for giving people  the hope we need in this world. ✝️✝️
Awesome
That’s karma
He probably wanted the cougar he saw on the driver license. That'd be my reason to show up and return it.
that because he can’t find anything useful in it…
Well done boy really
May God bless 🌺🌹🌺 🙏💕🤲🙏
0:07 I dont mean to break the moment, guys. But this guy was just a great guy. But only thing is there is no hope for our new generation. That is just one teen.
This is fake
Thank YOU JESUS!!!  Please Bless this young man all the more Lord. Amen Amen and Amen.
What a good dude.
I have a new idol. 👍
Great kid!!
May the Good Lord Bless You young man...these deeds may go unnoticed to the human eye, but there is a MUCH HIGHER BEING aware of all you do. I pray this is contagious!
I returned a wallet and got accused of stealing it Lmao
That's what's up right there!...😊
Something tells me he wouldn’t of returned my wallet. He only did it because it was a pretty lady and thought he could score by taking it to her house 😂
Working at a movie theater, I found a purse left under a seat and while checking for ID (company policy so we don't just hand it to whoever claims it's theirs) I stumble on what looked like thousands of dollars. I checked the ID and when the woman came to claim it, I handed it to her after confirming her name and she leaves with the purse and hands me nothing as a reward. Lesson learned to keep the purse 😆
He saw her drivers license and wayyyy too much reality kings and my boy was like....🤔🤔😏
💜💜
I bet money is not all the guy got from those girls 😏
Must be a proud mom God Bless noce boy
He is a good soul  . I'm  proud of him.. I have 3 kids.  A 30  +23 + 21..I'm expecting all 3 to do the right things.  So far  they done it
He saw her I.D and took a chance for love and he just got famous. lol
Hopefully I get to find a purse or something 🤣😭😭😭
Bruh got the same first and last name as me 😂
God bless young man
SOMETHING IS VEEERRRRY FISHY ABOUT THIS STORY 😕😕🤔🤔
I wouldn't even take the $3000 if it were me. And if I had to I'd just give it away in donation to much needed funding. A kind deed is a reward in itself.
So nice good mom taught him well
Follow the 10 commandments Christians and ask for forgiveness so you go to heaven
That’s rightt 👌🏻
That’s was that lady’s nephew they faked it
Glad to live in the same county as this dude. Class act.
Yes. It's called moral values and it does still exist
My grandfather taught me that "The greatest sign of good character is doing the right thing even when no one is watching".  Good advice indeed.
This a good story...he deserves what he gets...I hope he never loses his sense of kindness. Good dude!!!
What he has and his mom instilled in him, That's called: Integrity! 😆
That so nice dude go you
As of July 3rd, 10pm Est the Gofundme has raised $13,797 dollars
we don't need people like him, we need to be like him...
Still have good person, good job bro
jokes aside, he fine 😭
Melina, Eliana, and Adrian all have angels watching over them. <3
god bless this boy, terrific job 👏👏👏👏❤
What a honest boy
Homie saw how fine she was and was tryna cop a lil sum sum 👀 jk that’s dope! Stay up!!
May this young man be blessed with a long happy, healthy life filled with precious moments. 💜💕❤️
Excelente
Love to see it
one in a thousand...
this happened to me. I saw a purse sitting on the ground in a grocery store parking lot. it was dark, and the purse was black. My heart started racing because I immediately put myself in their position. So I took it inside to the customer service desk. they were shocked. I hope the person behind the counter did the honorable thing too.
Dude got 4k and basically any job he wants now LOL.  Just show your potential employer this video
A teen AND Hispanic, dispelling so many lies that people hurl against that demographic. I'm sure he'll do something positive with the $3K rather than blow it on himself. I LOVE IT!!
Good kid and he should be rewarded👍👍
all love to him but if i saw her on the license i’d prolly return it too😅
I'm glad there is still good people in San Diego
The one time I lost my stuff I never got them back complete smh! So god bless this teenager 🙏🏽 I know one day it will b his turn n god will b there to support him 🙏🏽😁
Great parenting made a great young man ♡
W
Good ❤️💪🏽🧨
If I find that purse u ain’t getting nothing back 💯
"There's hope--" Nah just got lucky he's the one that found it.
I would not take the money. I would only take kindness.
Have her friend stand up and slowly spin around a few times...
We need more stories like this !
She better have gave some him 😜
This proves that people have good in them especially this young man and his family far too often especially in the big cities even the parents say things like finders keepers but these parents brought the old ways into these modern days we need more parents like them and more kids like this young man.
ya love to see it
yo no way
Good job  young man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Would like to think 99% of people would do this. I can't even count how many times I've done stuff like this, it's just called being nice.  It's good news when someone does it, but it's bad news that it's news in the first place, because being nice to each other should just be what we do, and the being nice part should be its own reward (and indeed it probably was; no need to pay someone $3000 for being nice, because it's what we should all be doing all the time anyway). It's a sad statement on society that anyone would be shocked that someone would do a nice thing like this and that it would be a massive news story. Breaking news, someone didn't behave like a total selfish freak, let's pay him $3000 and make him a star.  Weird world.
Kudos to his parents and to him for listening! 🙏✝️🇺🇸
I know I’m a bit drunk, but these broads had multiple eyes… ALIENSS!!!!
There is hope! Good on them to reward the young gentleman.
Bravo!!!!!!!
Awesome story 👍🙏
Even i am a Pilipino but we wanted more people to do the same
Idk why but this almost made me cry... I think its just so rare to see such a kind person do a good dead and expect nothing in return
Lol that’s what’s up
Awesome, I love this!
THATS MY DADS NAME!!
Lucky parents having ths young boy
A lady at the bofa drivethru left money at the atm, I honked her and gave her money back. She hugged me 😭🥺, I felt so good that day 😼✌🏽
Sheeeeeit, I return peoples stolen or repo’d vehicles and hardly get a thank you…. 🙄
😍
Honesty is the best policy I commend this young man for being honest and returning her purse to her. He was brought up right.
last time i returned a walet ($200+ inside), drove 8 miles to the guys house, I didn't even get $5 for gas ($0).... crabcakes!! 😡
Real stand up dude 👍🏿
My boyfriend returned a purse from a shopping cart and took it into the store yesterday.
esta bien chulito ese speedy 🥵
That’s the son of a parent who did their job and raised a stand up young man. Well done.
I would be proud to call him my son. I'm raising 5 boys and I hope and pray that God leads me to raise them right. His mama did a great job! 🙌🏼
Buy lil joker a belt
'Teach your sons to be gentlemen and your daughters to accept nothing less'. Fine young man, credit to his family, love from NZ.
Do good even when no one is watching this has to be a quote that everybody needs to read a few times and let it sink in.... This goes to all the people on social media that do good things to people and feel the need to record it. Do it out of your heart!
Sweet kid man
I’m so glad he is getting rewarded for his good deed because he did it without expecting anything in return.
universe
He tryna get some 🎂
Incredible. God bless.
Great kid and parenting!
Yep, do the right thing even when nobody is watching! I like that one.
He did the right thing!
Sweet!!!!!
Staged or not.. I like seeing these kinds of things
god bless kid👌
Once a return a bag and she accused me of stealing!!! Lucky him...
San Diegans ! That’s why I love it here 🤍
Y'all we don't need more people like him, we need to be like him
The fact that this is considered newsworthy makes me fear for my generation.
I love it ! This is amazing 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Plot twist: He stole your identity and three months from now, you’ll be in 200K in debt and he’ll be on a vacation of a lifetime in Mexico!  🇲🇽
Kung sa pilipinas pa yan naku wag na kayu maghintay Hindi na yan ibabalik
Glad to see that, don’t judge someone by the cover.
Sounds fake, and now they have a Go Fund Me.
It’s at just under $14,000 right now!!!
Very nice  honest young man.  He definitely deserved a nice reward.
I would have tried to clap some cheeks
Good job young man
Plot twist, he saw the license picture and wanted a hook up.   That woman’s cute.
Good job young man! 💯
Proud of this young man.
“Hope” ???
Finally, parents who raised their kid right and a youngster who knows right from wrong. This kid has a bright future ahead of him.
Integrity
Good on the kid for returning the purse but also great job to the ladies for going out of their way to get him a reward that will hopefully go a log way towards whatever he wants to do with his life.
Salute 🫡 HA
Good job
Kids can avoid joining gangs and going to prison by listening to their mothers 😊
Never judge a book by its cover
Blacks gotta learn from this guy
I love my Latino people's, 😊😊😊🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 We all about family values😊.
Why can't everyone be like that
Just think, If no $ was involved this video would've never occured
He fine
Illegals?
He spent it on fentanyl and hos
He did a good deed.   I returned a wallet that was left at the bus stop containing about 1400 to 1800 cash, with credit card serveral years ago. I can't remember if I got a thank you from the owner.  Some said I should've but I returned it because  it wasn't mines, I knew who it belong and I'm hoping If I loose something it would be returned to me.
This is sad that people have to do a story on something like this and act like it's such a miracle when it really shouldn't be. It's also sad that most people who find a purse would steal it.
Always do the right thing even when no one is watching 🫶🏼
Good 🙂
Love it! You never know when doing the right thing will be beneficial
The two times I left my wallet behind in the store somebody returned it to the front desk and all my stuff was in there people can be nice
He’s so god dam fine😭
Wow!  That doesn’t happen very often … young or old.  Very honorable.  He got a reward not even expecting one.
he is fine.
This is why I believe in Karma. The fact he was doing what’s right because it’s right, not expecting any reward, and Now he’s 3k$$ richer.
Good Job, Ese!
this guy needs a key to the city
I have a feeling he will send the raised money to charity. Great young man. I really don’t subscribe to the fund raising part. Good is good. Good doesn’t necessarily need to be rewarded materially in order to characterize it so. The motivation for doing good should stay clear of financial reward. I believe he did the gesture from his heart ❤️ without any expectations and maybe there was no need to re-program his cerebral reward centers. God bless him. Love his heart. Our generation indeed has hope. 👍👍
3 thousand dollar reward....LMFAO,
That’s what’s up
Integrity.  Good things for him.  🍺⚡🍺
He saw her fine ass and went to find her hahaha
Stop cappin he thought he was gonna hit 😈
YES. I am happy this happened. IN CALIFORNIA too! Good for him. I hope more people follow his example.
"Always do the right thing when no one's watching" that's called integrity. We need more people in this world like this honest young man. God bless him 🙏
Good Lord maybe there is hope for this world after all.
This makes me cry. Such a beautiful human being. 🙏😇
Best feeling is when someone does return something you have lost. It’s an awful feelings losing something very essential in life.
That’s what’s up !!!!
Wish someone had done this for me when I left my purse on a bus. Oh well…not everyone is honest.
What a wonderful young man! I pray his honesty and integrity bring him all the good things as he goes through his life!   I hope he succeeds in life and  become who he wants to be.            Finds many good friends to share encouraging  one another to continue to do good deeds and have a blast in this crazy uncertain and ruff world!       What an example he is for others!
The biggest reward would have been taking her out on a date.
I returned a purse with an iphone  and all her personal stuff that my girlfriend found in a Casino restroom at Las Vegas. Feels good to return personal belongs cause it's the right thing and also cause if i ever lose something it might return.😄😁😁😁
I'll be the honest person here. I would have taken the purse.  Or would I? Idk.   Ehh, the kid gunned for a go after it. It's something that needed to be fixed. He fixed it. Which is why he rolled with it
Give him favor in the name of Yahshua Hamashiach Amen
Had he been black, this wouldn't be a story at all. What an amazing story nonetheless.
Amazing ❤️
hes mad fine
That man saw the ID picture and thought he was gone get him a piece for bringing the purse to her. He didn’t want no money to begin with
God bless that young man and those ladies may his actions also bring upon the Holy Spirit upon all their lives amen 🙏🏼
Cool kid
I mean look how damn beautiful she is. I would've walked her purse to her lmao
May the lord cover him and he has a fruitful life 🙏
Can I be the Devil? When he saw the ID picture of sexy Eliana Martinez, he returned the purse of course!
how he knew where she lived?
This is the kind of news that should be spread across the world, just watching and hearing about this story gave me chills of hope and positivity. More stories like this should be covered. It would change for a better cause and outlook.
Good job!❤️
Love that !
*Also, never judge a book by its cover!*  alot of ppl could of took 1 look at this young man and thought he was a thug. It's just clothes and a cultural style. I know some of the nicest kids in my hood who you would think with 1 look they were trouble. Just a friendly reminder...never judge a book by its cover yall! *Much Love!*  ❤
When you play as a paladin, but still use that old skin from the halloween expansion.
many years ago I found someone's $2,000. Louis Vuitton wallet and it had about $50, an ID card from Australia and some credit cards. I tried desperately to return the wallet to the woman, no luck. I contacted the issuing banks of the cards in her wallet and they wouldn't relay a message to her. So I had to write a letter to the address on her Australian ID and maybe a month and a half later I get a call from the girl and was able to return her wallet. she was grateful and shocked and it was great to be able to return it.
*Bravo young man* 👏 👏 👏
MiLF wants some of that Jordi Polla
I just remembered the lawyer who kept the 6k he found at the courthouse and got sacked. lmao
A LIL TEARY EYED. GOOD JOB BABY BOY
Find him and make him read the comments i bet he would never hurt a fly in his life
He will be a good role model to his children may God bless him also bless his mother for showing him the right path
Outstanding! He returned everything to her just like she left it. His intentions were to bring it to her just like he'd hope someone would do the same for him. And in the back of his/our heads, we always hope to get a reward, but that's not the main goal. Returning property is #1, and if a reward happened to come with it, then thats a bonus. All of yall take note of this video, this is what your spose to do in these situations. No matter what, God will reward you later on, which is greater than anything else. So do what's right!
Well done, kid!
Hope he’ll get a ton of trees
He saw the DL and saw she was a baddy so he pulled up
Fun fact if you want to do the right thing but the owner of the purse/wallet is too far away or its out of your way, just drop the purse/wallet in a US Postal Service box, they will return the wallet/purse to owner's address.
Respect for that big dawg. THAT is what cool people do homie.
For now it's 1-0🤭!
How do you not know you were missing your purse with all that important stuff inside
A sign of good parenting, always be a good person.
He’s so fine 😍😍😍
Almost at $14K now! Good on you young man!
almost 14k now
Good man!
Purse probably didnt have anything
W video
Plot twist: he check what’s inside the person and there wasn’t nothing he wanted so he returned it hoping to get something out of it    Jp for all u sensitive take to the heart ass ppl
He saw the baddie on the DL and pulled up trying to shoot his shot 🤣
Imagine if everyone was like this, we'd live in paradise.
He’s cute
What a good boy!!! 👏👏👏
This young man saw that hot milf and was hoping for a different reward😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
He will be blessed 🙌🏿🙌🏿
I did the same thing and I got a mentos
I think he just wanted to tap looking at the license photo
Love this!
I would've kept everything in it and returned just the ID CARD I know how hard it is to go thru DMV process and get a new one
Hopefully he at least influences a few ppl! Bc that at least makes one more better person out there! 🥰👌
imagine if he only returned it because there was no money in it
A good man right there
👏👏👏👏👏
Purse probably ain't have no Ca$h in it so he figured he'll get a reward & he was right. 😂😂
The boy was raised right
God bless you men👍🙏💗
Very refreshing.
What a wonderful young man!!! Bravo to you !!!!!! We need more like you in our world!!! Kiss your mom for me she raised an amazing man~ YOU💕👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
This is noce, i got my own wallet stolen from a friends party, no return. Lost 1k
This is a young man who was raised right if more young people where like him the world would be a better place
This happens all the time in Japan without any expectation of reward. I wonder how they did it?
They should of "thanked" him in the back bedroom
CONGRATS MOM for raising a good man
Wouldn't be surprised if this was a setup between them all to start a gofund me and it worked
good man
Nice to see the news showing good things instead of bad
This warms my heart If only more people were half as good....
looks like kruk one 🧍🏼‍♂️
Awesome parenting produced an awesome trustable young man. Hope all you attempt to do in life goes your way young man. Achieve greatness in everything by doing good.
This is what y’all consider newsworthy now..? 😂
what a great young man❤️
Bless this young man!
“2 women had a surprise for him” Every man’s dream 😁
Money can buy nearly everything externally , but it can't buy respect, honesty, tolerance, kindness and more importantly a good heart!
I would have returned it too n hopefully get the toppy🥒🍑
i love this
Still good honest people out there. That was such a kind young man❤️
Rodruguez is with the shihh 👏🏽👏🏽👍🏽
Everyone talking about the dude while im here wanting to talk about two absolute milfs!!
Yeeeeees!
Yessir 🤞🙏
Awesome...tells me there is still hope for our young people...all is not lost
It all starts at home. How you raise and teach your kids they will use through life.  My daughter returned a wallet that she found and I tracked down.  No reward but it’s the best feeling to show them from right and wrong.
Not trying to be a buzz kill or be rude but the older generation seems to think teenagers aren’t capable of doing good deeds
He's a smart man he knew he would have been rewarded
That’s very nice of him to return it
Wonderful story. God is great
dude was trying to get laid....its that simple
Adrian a G
If there was no cash ill return but if cash was was in there im not returning it
He was raised right !
Love seeing stuff like this warms my heart & brings tears of good feelings to my eyes.  Great parents = awesome son=amazing life.
I have done that a thousand times.. where’s my 3k 🤣 other times when doing Uber.. even drove to a different city to return DL Credit Cards.. other times sent it by mail..
🥰🥰🥰thank you for give him tips maybe others youngs can be the same
Nice to see good when there is so much wrong..good job kid.
Pretty sure if the purse contained a bank envelope filled with Franklins it would have changed the outcome.
The kind of news I want❤
I’ve done this before and got a $40 reward. I know most people would have kept it but I was always raised to do the right thing and karma is a beautiful thing
I did this two weeks ago and got $40 for it but I mean it paid for the gas I used to drive all the way across many towns to deliver it. The money sometimes doesn’t matter it’s the idea of what you put out you want reciprocated. 🫶🏼
He’s a good kid, no doubt about it, but it makes me sad that someone doing the right thing makes the actual news.
I’ve returned two ladies purses over the years, my reward I guess is living another day
Nice young man Good Job ❤️❤️

Momma raised her son up right. Good on you momma.  Hugs to her son for doing the right thing. And a kiss too😘
No money in the purse huh
God bless his heart, what a beautiful young  man❤️❤️❤️
This man raised right 👏🏽 🙌🏻
Need stories like this on all news networks with continuous cycle.
Plot twist, he replaced the cash in the purse with fake bills. 😂
This young man is a great person, we need more people like him in the world👵
bless his soul and keep him safe
He knew he was gonna get paid
Am I the only one that heard his “moms” as in plural?
Yk he smashed
isn't this @iamj.i 🤔??
Isn't this like... Normal tho?
bro saw the id and thought he could smash
That young mans mama must be so proud of him. I don't even know him and I'm very proud of him. Good work bud, your mama raised you right.
Foo was Tryna pull😂
That’s dope 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Good stuff Brotha. And hug your momma for being a beautiful person!

Awesome!
"There's hope for our younger generation"  - Someone who has never been on the internet
He was trynna see if she single real talk, that one who lost her license got that fuego like a young Sophia Vergara
Now that's a reward.
we all know the real reason he returned it
It’s fake. The lady’s an attention seeker I mean look at all that Botox.
The go fund me is now at $13500!!
Good man! Love that!
Now what would a black person do in this situation?
Loved this video ❤️✌🏻✊
He fine tooooo😩😩
Amazing
Love to see this!!!
Good kid.
word
A skrapa doing good deeds
If you're a business owner.. thats the kid you want to hire.. hes management material.. education and skills aside.. (since those can be learned).. character is hard to find.. and you either have it or you dont..
Dude saw the photo and wanted to smash no doubt. But got 3k out of it instead lol
Nice kid truly was wondering why so much stupidly? So now I gotta find these dumb individuals and return belongings. Sheesh
Raised right, for sure.
Crazy that it's that rare you'll find a good kid that he got paid 3k and maid the news all across the world for something so simple as returning something that's not his it's crazy and sad
We did that 3 years ago while on vacation in San Jose, CA! We found the  wallet on the ground in the parking lot. We checked for driver license and drove all the way to their house to return just because when i lost mine someone was so nice to MAILED it back to me without return address 😩so….. do good and watch it goes around!
❤🙏
he only did it because she is mexican like himself, had she been black, then he would've kept her purse because mexicans hate black people
:)
👏  👏  👏
👏
One time I lost a wallet with a picture of my brother in it. Someone found it randomly in my city and saw the picture then realizing it was my brother. After a phone call I got my wallet back.
its sad this is not the norm
I was driving in town once and saw a purse in the middle of the road. Pulled over, grabbed it and found the address and went to her house. She wasn’t home so I waited by her house for a few hours until she came back. She was thankful and happy because there was quite a lot of cash inside. All I got was a thank you, and that was more than enough reward for me. If I’d lost my wallet, and I have with hundreds of dollars, I’d want someone to do the same.
What a wonderful young man.
what in the world would it be like if we had hearts like this ?
I helped a woman and her daughter with a flat two nights ago in the toughest neighbourhood in my city. She didn’t have anyone to pick her up, where’s my 3k :(
Also goes to show you shouldn't judge people characters by their looks. Hat backwards, pants sagging, chains. Most people would think this guy is the one to steal a purse not bring it back. You can never tell someones true intentions of their hearts defining them by their appearance!
When no one is watching… God is… ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
What an amazing young man!
What speaks louder is that he doesn’t look the type to do this! Good job young man!
❤️❤️
Always do the right thing, even if no one is watching !! :D
We need to be like him.
Have a blessed day and know that Jesus loves You
My bad I ain’t watch the whole video I’m friieedd😂😂😂
They only post this cuz he looked like he wouldn’t take the bag but he returned it.
✊🏾
Respect Fr. But I do find it crazy what this world has turned into and how he gets paired 3,000 for returning a purse yea good for him but it shouldn’t have to be like this Ynk?
Bros playing gta 5 irll
bro got drip
Never judged a book by its cover!!!!! I appreciate this young man.
I had done the same, in hopes of getting invited in for coffee 😜😁😁
Fake
He probably stole it in the first place
Holy hell. Another person named Eliana. I hope the name becomes more common. I am no longer alone 😭
And the same ethnicity kinda a weird circumstance
No one wants to say anything about his appearance compared to his actions. You all know damn well you wouldn't expect this from a man who looks like him. Don't judge a book by its cover
Ok?
Protect that king he one of the chosen 1s
He did that because she was fine as hell, I would too
He brought it back when he saw it was empty lol
I returned a driver's license ...went out my way...all the way to the Bronx...rank the door bell...she came out..told her..of returning her license I found in the street...guess what it's not about money...just a thank you would've been good.
thats a great trusting community.
Great job young man.
he’s fine asf
Oh my gosh.....his answers/reasons were the sweetest 😭🤧💗💚
Crazy how much of an impact The Minions: Rise of Gru made on society
♥️
“Fine young man”😭
Good samaritan 🥰
I💗this....☺️
This kid coming from stable parents. Mentally, spiritually.
My teachers always told me honesty is the best policy. You sleep better at night knowing you were true to yourself and others.🙏❤️✌️
Dude prob stole the bag and found nothing good so he decided to give it to the owners in hope of them giving him reward for it.
We need more people, especially the young generation, like him on this 🌎. Thank you for renewing my faith in humanity :)
Good for him but u see a lot of kids with cancer not even reach their goals for a couple thousand
Definitely stole it 😂
Respectable foo citizen
i did the same to a rich person but the difference that i got 2 bucks 👍👍
I remember we found like 5k dollars in a income tax envelope by the mall and we we’re gonna keep it I was like 16 after a few steps I felt really guilty and turned it in😂😂till this day I regret it
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Good deed God bless the young man
Homies playing gta
😍
Your true character is what you do when no one is watching! Thats a stand up man!
I remember seeing this car in my neighbour's driveway checking the mail and when they left I saw an iPhone x something on the ground and I took it back to the owner cause i remember the car and they just said thanks
Just think of all the other good things he has done or will do while nobody is watching.  It boggles the mind.  Good job kid.
Wish all the boys to be like him.l wish he was my son.
That’s amazing he’s going places
u got a wonderful mom dude😍😍
W cuh
Ok
Good thing both the boy and the women did the right thing.  Salut to all
sad how this is not the norm... when even the media starts reporting it.
Many blessings💖😅💯
Make him the governor of something.
my man
Dude a stand up G
Wait, people get "rewarded" for doing what should be the bare minimum?
old mate was hoping to get a hot soccer mum :P
He did this.....I have done this and everybody should do this!
Good for him did the right thing bless him 🙏
My boy saw the id & wanted some cheeks
wholesome
That's awesome! There's still good people in the world.
Ngl he was trynna pipe
Good content
“Be the change you wish to see In the world”
Maybe their was not much in the purse only $60 bucks n hoped for the best in return & it was 🤣 🤣
great guy ❤️
We only steal from each other not women👍👍👍
Shout out to his Mother for raising him to have integrity and him keeping at it! 🎊🎊🎊
Plot twist: since there wasn’t any money he took it to her to try and get money..lol jk 😂 but imagine
So glad they rewarded him! Good job kiddo! Well deserved
I find it ridiculous that everyone is saying, "we need more people like him" Why do you think we need more? Because you refuse to be like himself but continue to worry about others. When you try to change you'll realize it is impossible to change others. Change begins with you and only you.
this happened to me. I lost my purse in a cab , months later someone returned it to me with nothing missing.
Good kid. How many people would pre-judge him by the way he looks? Lesson for everyone, just because a kid has some chains and a backwards hat doesn't mean he can't be a good person! His mom must be incredibly proud.
his style so nicee and this is so sweetttt
Finally some good shown about someone in our city. Good job youngster!
Good for him. Good mother.
dude got a bag and probably even bagged the chick with that drip. Respect g
what a JOKE
he want me
Definitely seen where she lives first 😂 and the kind of purse it was 😂 y’all dumb asf to think otherwise
I’m so glad there’s still people with a good heart
Wow after everything that goes on in this evil world its good to see this type of stuff. Now that's a real young man rite there. His parents raised a hell of a man. I love his moms advice as sell. WAY TO GO MOM and WAY TO GO to the 2 ladies that gave him the reward.
He should’ve asked for that number
He received more money than he would if he took the purse for himself instead.
Wow. Great story and great kid.
Music
Needed to see this today.
This is so wholesome i love it!
he’s fine af 😭
This is wonderful
That’s right my brother ❤️😍😍😍😍
I respect that props brother for doing the right thing
And that kid looks like a straight up gangbanger too. Even if he is or not he's a good kid and did a good deed. So don't judge a book its cover people!
there gd and honest faithful young pple inthe world wow
Ghetto trash but at least he has morales surprisingly
Surprised her friend didn’t take the $3k for her face
Seems like thats too much
Good for that young man. Just need to pick those pants up and he will be all set.
Great!
I hate it when people ask why they did the right thing, they did it because they wanted to do the right thing. Bravo young man for being awesome.
Took it back because no cash in the bag. Was hoping for a reward 😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥
this is the kind of stories I would like to see more of
He must not be from San Francisco 👏🏼😂
dih ofcourse he returned it look how hot the lady is
That's called integrity!!! It matters!
San Diego is literally the kindest city in the US
Stories like this need to be glorified. This will inspire more people to do good things
Good kid,..  I found a wallet once in a train on my way home from Amsterdam ... actually called the number in the wallet to bring it back...guess what... the woman's father still accused me of stealing.  Almost got in trouble for doing the right thing...so you know,... not everyone appreciates honesty
We will be an honest and responsible because we have a good mother who tough us honesty. When I was young I was on the round the world cruise in mid 80’s and Mrs Carter (the wife of the richest man in California, one of the owners of universal studios) forgotten to put a bag of jewelry back to her safety box. I found it and returned it to Mr Carter. Because it is not belong to me, but on the same cruise my mom lost one of her blue diamond earring worth $10,000 but no one has returned it to her🤪. That what the reality in this world is. Good and bad.
In a normal world, the hero is the woman who rewarded him 3K$ for this "Normal" deed, but in our world, his deed is heroic one and her reward is normal. anyway hat off for both of you guys
What a good boy :)
he was definitely raised right
Wtf the cholo homie look alike a good Samaritan 😕😕
USA 😂 The country where criminiality is the norm so when someone does the « right thing » (just a normal a thing to do btw) he ends up on TV
There’s hope
The only reason this was made a big deal is because the way he’s dressed and hes brown 🤷🏻‍♂️
Unlike “Andy Tiffas” nowadays. Great job, to him, but even better job on his mother.
posting a minor without permission on social media..
This is great
He did a great job, why go fund me, I can’t understand
I love how normal stuff gets so hyped in the US news :)
Beautiful young man with a wonderful mom
One cuz doing the right thing
I love stuff like this this is what we need more of in our life
💙😊🌍
I want his instagram
Good foo , his mom raised him right
He looks like a gang member but insides he is a beautiful Angel, his mother raised him well. God will watch over you young man🙏🙏🙏
There is hope for humanity
this is why we need to stop stereotyping people. Good on you my guy
👍🏻
Orale’ good to see that
Whoever reads this comment, y'all better act like him starting now 😭
He probably got money or something stashed in his pockets
Awesome job Lad your a good man. Even when no one is looking. That's called being a man. 😎👍💯🇨🇦❤️
They wouldn’t have to give me money just a date with eliana 😍
Wow! He returns a cheap purse and ends up getting 3k back!
Good things to good people
Buddy seen the picture and just wanted to see if he could pipe shorty
FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE .
This story made me cry. This kid is one in a million for being a good person inside out. God Bless him and the parents who raised him right.
Should of game him money like you did and coochie lmao
We need more people like this!
MAMA COULD BE PROUD!!
How much was then actually in the purse if he got 4K reward ? 😳
The friend is sexy..especially with that accent. He shoulda asked for a date night lol
Cuh was tryin ta see what’s up with da female in the driver license pic🤣
God bless them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
His approach demeanor seems very non threatening. And he didn’t have to do what he did. He didn’t have to go out his way. He could have also stole whatever that was inside of it including her indenificathion info. That was beyond kind of him and only 17 with a good head on his shoulder. Glad the kid got rewarded for something that he did right.
Lol, dude stole bag and then returned for money :D
I don’t know you young man…….     But I am very proud of you!!    My mother taught us the same values
Wholesome
We must protect this man at all cost
As everyone should cause I think the same way
He saw the license and figured he’d try to hookup… good on him lol
Good job young man, by the way Eliana is a stone cold fox
Legend. I wish all the younger generation had even half the respect this young man has. The world would be a better place for sure. Your mum your family, me and absolutely everybody who watches this video is proud of you brother. ❤️ ✌️
Lost my wallet at the mall and some one mailed it to me had $40, ss card, credit cards and nothing wast taken. I’ve always remember that and try to pass good vibes back.
they seem like the exact type of women who’d leave a purse in an empty shopping cart in a parking lot
Bro was trying to smash 😂
I wish everyone can be like this young man, respect others and the world would be a better place!
That's a blessing ☺️😊
Good man 👍👍
a real ☝️ 💪💯
good guy!
yo thats cool he got a go fund me page for doing the right thing😂😂😂
Yo Rico get your cousins here tonight homie we gonna celebrate
S/O to the youth man
Handsome
I know what he was thinkin...
Dayum she got a nice house n Audi R8 in the drive way 0:14
So he returned the purse with 3k in it and he gets 3k back for being a great person, big W for him, that boy got some good karma and we need more people like him, gif bless him and his family 🙌🏻
In Denmark where I live it’s not that uncommon that people do this. Or maybe I am really lucky. I have lost my wallet TWICE while shopping. Last time it was the cashier who called me. I know its his job. But the other time a young woman found my wallet on the street and found me on Facebook and contacted me that way.
The fact that this made the news breaks my heart. This man is being celebrated as some kind of hero for doing what any normal person would do.  It's like our society is so messed up, we're rewarding people for acting like people instead of criminals
I literally did the same thing the same year I met my wife in 1997, found a purse in a grocery cart at a Kroger in Durham, NC and took it to the address along with the $478 that was in it.  The guy that answered the door grabbed it and slammed the door in my face.  True story.  That year I found 2 wallets that I returned as well.  I never found one in the years before or since.
I hope he gets that dream school and job because I know one thing he would make a great accountant.   Trust him with my business money.
We don’t need more people in the world like him, there’s already plenty like him, they just need more recognition.
❤️❤️🙏🙏
This is a blessing he’s sexy too great job 👏🏾
Good lad.
良い子だ
Jesus died for our sins so that we can go to heaven. He payed our price. Put your trust in Jesus Christ and he will grant you the gift of heaven.
He saw the ID and was like “Ima help this lady out” 😂
He wanted to pipe lmao
Very wholesome I must say
Clearly a nice decent kid but I can't say it's so surprising that someone would return a lost purse! Specially when the very attractive female friends license is inside hahaha
Take notes
That’s quite amazing.
Nah, young cat saw the picture on the ID and was hoping to get some when he got to her crib lmao us youngins know exactly what he was doing
This is the difference in good youth today, his parents have raised him correctly!
this place looks like CJ home com GTA SA lol
Plot twist: It's her son 😂
bless his soul
He prolly did find it & went thru it and didn’t find no money n return it and he didn’t except too receive 3k
Wow, that's awesome.  I hope the best for that young man.
When i say the go fund me name I thought they were tryna give bro a ticket💀💀👀
Ye see, good good people in this world.👍👍👍
Wonderful young man, great job Mom!!! 🙏🏼😊💙
Nice 👌
Waw what a Great young man..  May God bless Him
Fake news
Props to this outlet for highlighting these stories. We need more of these stories to be out front more often.
The world needs more people like that. Unfortunately in the world we live in today, an act of kindness and honesty generates amazement! Congratulations to the boy, this should be normal and the astonishment should be generated precisely if it were the opposite.
Real question is!!! When he turns 18, can he slide in them DMs lol….
"good deeds do come around" always is good to do the right choices that people can see that your a good person
Way to go young man! 💖☘️
Very promising ❤️❤️
Lil Puppet did right good man
Bro seen her I'd and was trying to make a move omm 🤣🤣
we all know what would happen if it was a mans belongings
He got 9 k on go fund me who took the 6 k
Don’t ever change young man, your parents have done a fine job. Hats off to you
RESPECT ! 👍
The results of raising your kids the right way
That a boy representing my hometown San Diego well!! We need more of this in the world 🌍😌
His mom must be so proud ❤️
Haha 3K reward. Yes i bring it back too, its better then this empty bag
This foo was trying to get at that good looking lady  .😆
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🥳🥳🥳🥳
Man was tryin to get a number not a purse lmao
Damn law abiding citizen ass foo🤘🏽
W man
Restores the faith
I did my best to return someone's missing mobile after I found it in the middle of the road even tho it was damaged they insisted on giving me £50 🥺
One cool dude.
He prolly wanted to be raised by the woman once he looked in the purse and saw the ID lol
Be honest , he was trying to shoot his shot lol
Knowing the youth he probably wasn’t going to return it at first
That’s Hectors wife, she was hiding three spoon engines in the purse. Kid prefers LS engines.
Heart warming story
I’ve found a few wallets or purses in the last few years and turned them in. I’ve also ended up losing or misplacing my own wallet in that time and each time I’ve had it returned to me or ended up finding it. As the saying goes you reap what you sow. Planting those seeds of good always tend to come back to in some way or another.  Well done young man, you did the right thing.
The woman on the right is straight up rude not giving the boy something in return
He deffo saw the license pic and wanted to smash …
There could’ve been a check in that purse for someone’s life savings and that kid brought it back! Everyone in the comments go donate to that kid!
Nice story 😊
He just thought he was gonna smash let’s be real here lol
Respect to him 💪✌️
Good kid! Great morals!
Good for you kid.
Respect foo. 🤝
its so surprising because its California. It wouldn't be that big of a deal where I live
I love this. I found a FAT wallet in the parking lot with money sticking out and I didn’t even open it I went inside the store and gave it to a worker and they told the guy and he saw me but didn’t even thank me or anything 😀 even the cashier was like damn you should’ve kept a $20 at least lol but I don’t like stealing from people. But a thanks would’ve been nice at least
Dude had diamonds on and an Audi at 17, tf he need that money for???
3k? Thought they raised 15k
🙏🙏😭😭❤️❤️❤️😻😻🥰🥰🤪🥰
The sad thing that some people would label him because of the way he looks, but it shows we shouldn’t judge a person by the way they look or dress. He was raise right for sure, not many honest people left in this world.
Wait. This is THAT rare?
Plot twist he stole it and then thought he could get a reward so he went back
I love this man
it was 10k
I did it once and got rewarded with $20.
if i seen that face on the id i would’ve tried to find her too
Bro tried to smash so bad
Bravo!!!
I am so proud of this kid!! What an outstanding thing to do. He saved that lady a world of stress. He is heaven sent. Keep up those good deeds. They fulfill your heart and that is something money cant buy. Stay Blessed and stay humble, y'all.
The "do a good deed when no one is watching" is from the 12 step recovery program ("just for today's"). Maybe his mum is in recovery and obviously did a fine job with her lad. Very inspiring.
Don't expect this good deed from anyone in CHICAGO airport. I lost an item, freaking no one in immigration tsa or police or any good smaritunnn returned or announced it..  😬I'm chill though.. whoever got my stuff, enjoy n remember in next life i will get it from yaaa... or we r even
Be the change you want to see in the world. There is right and wrong which side will you choose?
Wow all of these comments making so many assumptions of this kid and his family based off of 1 incident. It kinda makes me wonder about other stuff I hear about people and how much of it is true, and the kinda character they have based off of their 1 incident... Never Judge anyone.
Very nice of course😍!! But why is it so shocking?
Faith in humanity restored
That was staged that's her nephew
It’s called integrity doing the right thing when no one’s watching.
This kid actually works at a Ralph’s in Chula Vista, San Diego. He knows the lady who’s bag he “returned.” He “found the bag” on a shopping cart, left his shift early and stopped showing up to work after the gofundme was created. It was all a scam and y’all fell for it.

I love this so much! It made emotional to know that goodness does still exist in the world.
That's integrity
W dude
If he was black would she have called the cops b4 opening the door
He prolly saw she looked good and had to pull up lmaoo
As a Latino I'm so PROUD he represented us like that! My mom and dad also raised me to do the right thing even when nobody is looking. But God is always watching and he rewards those with clean hearts. God bless this young man and may he continue in that path.
Off camera  They thanked him With threesome  😂😂
We need more people in this world like him  people can change the world if you try to 🙏
Good lad.
My boy just thought she was cute....
He was trying to smash
Why will someone be that good 😂
Good news 🎉. Wish there was more news like this
Que chido 🥰
God bless him and his family🙏🏻😊💪🏻
We need more people like this guy! Much prosperity and luck to him
he was rather expecting a hot date
thats a Thug! a love THUG🙏
I will never return a lost wallet or anything because I did the right thing once and they took me to jail for so think about it people he got luck this time
Any other channel would've titled it "$4K" as long as it broke $3001
Of course homie saw her drivers license picture and decided to do a good deed
There's definitely no hope in this generation
Well done young man🔥🔥
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👍🏾👍🏾👏🏾
Lovely
W
My hope for humanity has been restored. What a wholesome story
he’s kind of cute lmao
dont take whats not yours, help others and receive more
“Theres hope for our generation!”  now scroll thru twitter.
Real story Adrian is a billionaire n doesn't want your chillerz
he deserves it! good job!
Mama raised a MAN!
Hope still left in 🌎👏 to young man
It was 10k I thought
Hell yea. 👍👍👍👍😁😁😁😁🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🚚
This was a gentleman act from a young gentleman. I wish him all the best in life!
what else he got after that?
I dont mean to burst anyone's bubble but he probably  did it because they were the same race if it would have been a black person I doubt that he would have cared!!!
Good deed man. And it has nothing to do with this but the aunt is truly beautiful!
Shouldn't this be the rule not the exception all kids should be raised to do the right thing good job young man
So sweet all around 🥰
what a Responsible young man
If everyone just had each other's backs like this it would be a better place forsure
Well, I found 5000$ on the street here in Canada and I returned it to the owner, but have got nothing but trouble. Good for him 👍
Good Job bro
That's funny , some lady had dropped her purse literally right outside her house as she was getting out of her car. I guess she had no clue. But I knocked on her door showed her the purse and she accused me of taking it. I was confused and tried so hard to explain to her I found it as I was walking and she called the cops as I was leaving she started yelling and her neighbors came out and she got them to chase and try to capture me.  Damn next time I'll just take it to the police station myself or mail it to whoever.. she has cameras in front so I wonder if she ever seen it. Also I lost my wallet with a thousand bucks in there. My driver's license and social. I'm homeless so that's why I kept everything in my wallet. Karma can kiss my Ass!
Good to see there's some good in the future generation.
There's still hope for the future
Damn they be eating each other out
This dude was trying to get the Cooch
The only sane person in cali
They could've atleast added in a 3sum
Good job young man!
😂😂
Salute
Good for him. I found $10,000 cash inside a purse and didn't get a thank you.
Way to be young man. I hope all the best for you.
Ain’t no way these 2 milfs ain’t let him hit Lmaooo
My mans wanted to pipe he wasn’t returning the purse 😭😭😭

This is so dope
If someone finds him share a video
Let me find a lost purse I want 3k
Small details trully matter
You know it's  nice when the nice guy wins!
I woulda been all over the license owner for reward.   Num num
I wish someone returned my wallet, when I lost it 2ys ago
So I stole this purse and as I looked inside I found the girls ID and boy was she hot so I tried to kill two birds with one stone is more what it sounds like
So I should do go fund me

👍
I love hearing things like this
I returned a wallet with $200 in it with expired driver license.
Where's the Seks?
I usually skip this part
😎🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
THANK YOU YOUNG MAN!!! Thank you for being the hope and answered prayers to the mess that is our world right now. ❤️🙏
Yo that’s Jamari
Good kid 👍
"Theres hope for out Younger Generation" Very.. Very LITTLE hope.
Wow what a Beautiful Kid. And the quote from his Mom “Always do the right thing even when no one is looking”  Great parenting  leads to good outcomes. This young Man gonna be all right in life.
Not that its as significant as this but i remember in highschool I found $50 bucks on the ground and I went to the front desk to say I found it. No body claimed it so they gave it to me at the end of the day. I could have taken it from the start but it felt good. Oh and also very recently I was walking on the side walk and I live in a major city and this lady went to grab something out of her purse and I saw a wad of cash fall out. I knew being in a city someone would for sure keep it so I grabbed and it and ran up to her to say she dropped it
I wonder if there was a thousand bucks in it he still would of returned it?? I mean what’s a kid gonna do with an empty green handbag ?
How can the lady not offer some reward initially for his efforts?  I mean at least $20 but honestly should have been at least $100 to $200 because gas is expensive as hell.
Wow!!! Amazing kid!👍❤️❤️❤️
bro i returned a bag with 7k in it and got $20 from the dude💀
Can someone lose their purse at Walmart parking lot?
👏
This speaks volumes for how he was raised and his character!!!! Young ppl everywhere this is what do do in these situations....it can be difficult & quite costly ,also time consuming replacing identification cards, social security cards, credit cards, etc in a person's purse or wallet. I love how his mom told him to do good ALL the time even when noone is watching, the Lord sees ALL!!!!!!
Need more people like him.
is it just me, or does he look extremely worried on the door cam pic. like just the thought of them accusing him of actually stealing/keeping it but got cold feet and returned it anyways made him sick hes a damn good guy thats for sure
Bro is in a literal audi he got more $$ than you cute mamma
God bless 🙌 🙏 him! I hope know one in his neighborhood try to harms him 🙏 for the reward!
I did many time . I always try to find a way to return  to them.  Phones.  Wallets.  N but no one return me anything  lol but it OK.  I'm not expecting anyone to do me a return  .  God had better things for me ..
My man good dude 🙌
God Is Good All The Time ❤️❤️❤️ he was raised good nice young man
I did this with a wallet I found in a church parking lot, it was fun and an adventure to find the address. the owner was shocked and very happy. it was very fun and would do it again.
Young kid, dressed like Smokey off Friday. Good job.
Beautiful!! This Made my day 😊😊
Mumma raised you x
Good dude right there 💯
Very nice
Good job
Oh yeah they cute I will return it  too
More good deeds need gets praised
san diego foo making us look good
That's a good man he had a good mom that raised around I once found a wallet were $900 in it and returned it back to the owner with every penny in it and for the same reasons that the young man did it I was 22 at the time and still would do it no matter what age what I'm going through towels raise to do the right thing the respectable thing
That's awesome
I have a friend who gave back purse and didnt took anything and still went for jail, the owner was lawyer family, after jail time we found a wallet some time later in the beach, and he was the first one who gave back it to the owner, and owner again looked at him suspecious , checked if money stolen and such and even didint thank him. yet he still says he"ll do the right thing
NICE, NOW ALL WE GOTTA DO IS CLEAN UP THE MEDIA ... AND POLITICS
Nah he seen that ID and was like damnnnn 🙏🏼
My dad found a wallet once and returned it to the owner. When he arrived and gave it to them ,they accused him of stealing it and said they would call the cops on him. Ppl can be so ungrateful.
That’s a good man and he deserves even more
Such a  nice guy and he got some nice parents. God sees everything!
Well done!! Thank God some of our kids still listen to the good and express their goodwill!
This is very touching and it is lovely to see there is good young people out there. Great that they were able to raise that cash for him. He deserved it.
Good job young man, bless you..
❤❤❤
🤍
Good man
Bruh I just lost my wallet with ID, debit, credit and health insurance cards + $800 cash and nobody did this for me 🥴 I'm guessing they're casing my house instead.
I know why he returned the purse for real though😂
Homie had that drip on em🤞🏽
Done this like 3 times and all I got was a “thank you” without even a smile
love this!
Great story!
He saw the hot looking woman on the ID and said "bet!" 😂
Plot twist: he stole the purse but she had no money so he returned it
It all comes down to good parenting. God bless him ❤️
Nahhh he just got raised right
Latinas be looking so tasty
God Bless him
He was tryna get some cudi 😭
Awesome video. His mother taught her son to be honest and care about others. Thank you for sharing.  Have a wonderful day.  😊
This is so badass man 💯love to hear these stories ..love everyone involved ❤️
Hopefully he continues down the right path, most kids have good hearts but end up in bad places because of bad influences
I would’ve bookganged that without thinking twice
integrity
Karma is real💯💯💯💯💯❣️
What a good young man
she coulda just gave him some sloppy toppy and called it a day, 3k works too tho

EXCELLENT.  Young man was raised right.  Congratulations.
"This California teen did a good deed, he drove to this lady's hous- Wait what?"
Lovely, thanks young fellow.
👏👏🙏
W
This young man not only gave back the purse, he also gave back hope to a worthless society.
W in the chat
Love this ❤
❤❤❤❤
That is a damn good kid and he's going to be a good man. So much dishonesty in the world nowadays somebody like this is quite refreshing. Big props to him and the people who raised him!
thats a good boy!
Nobody dose this people take and never give your all lost in the world
Good stuff
So refreshing to see good news ❤
How refreshing!!!! Congrats to him for his honesty!!!!!
I found my neighbour's wallet. He was a misley git so I took 20 out his wallet and posted it back to him through the post office
God bless y’all and know that he loves each and every one of you, so much that he gave his only son Jesus Christ as proof ✨❤️✨
I smiled when I saw this on the news
Great man 👏
Adrian is an effing king 🫅🏽
The way he dressed in sure legit 90% of population would stereotype him and believe he would be a thief/ thug in the real world but man good to see we still have hope wish him the best in his future Transitions in life 💯🙏
What a sweet honey. Raised well. I’ve got a 17 year old son and I hope he’d do the same.
What a good young man
This shyt got me in tears. Good job young man.
He got 10k not 3k
3k? Shesus chris
KARMA IS REAL
He got 10 not 3, well atleast that gofund me raised 10 lol
Great job kid!! I just hoped Inside Edition would've interviewed the guy to at least give us a background of who he is.  He deserves all the praise 🤙🏼👍🏼
Good
Respectable young man. He was raised right. We need more honest ones like him.
🐐
Dope🔥
THEIR is hope ........ YOU'RE damn Right
Good parenting! Its so important to not just tell your kids its wrong but make them understand why. My grandmother told me when she was a kid during the days of the depression in the 30's she found a purse with lots of money in it. Even though her own family barely had money for food, she returned it. It turned out it contained the persons entire months grocery money. The lady ended up baking pies and food for my grandmothers family many times thereafter.  This story stuck with me forever, and it did make me choose to do the right thing a few times after instead of being opportunistic. RIP Nana, the most loving and wholesome woman Ive ever known.
🦕
He see how she looks so yeah
I know why he returned the purse🥶
I remember when I saw a wallet on the ground it had I'd ànd business cards so called her work site and then she text me back and picked up at my apartment complex and she gave $20.00 back That's what this reminds of If I ever see a purse or wallet Give yourself a pat on the back
Idk I think bro was trying smash the badie with the black hair
He wanted to tap
He saw the ID and wanted to come spit game😂
Those Mexican roots.
😇🙏🏽❤️
I mean not much hope for her if she forgot her purse
Lol it would have been more believable had they been different races. Sounds like a smart way to break off $4000 three ways 😂😂
3k not enough 🤣
Bro did this saggin💀
Just cus he look like a thug don't mean he's a thug.god appears in any way or form
This just brings joy to my heart. Mom did an excellent job. We don't think kids listen to us but they sometimes do.
Props to that dude, and props to you ladies for bringing it to light - world needs more of this right now for sure
Good job young man!!
Salute 🤟
Gofundme is over 13k! Reap what you sow kid
King
Someone raised him right
AWESOMENESS
Couldn’t this happen to me some ducker ain’t return mine w my social and I’d in it
Makes a lovely change to see young people being so kind
good kid....god bless him, good example
That’s awesome!!!
he’s fine too?!😩
Raised good .!!!
If the guy is black people uh uh uh they stole it the purse only 2% out of 100% black people is good
Firme
Good kid
Good kid
Makin’ his momma proud
That lady the recovered the purse first is cheap
There is hope for humanity!
Yea okay ima let yall know right now, he returned it because the shawty on the license prolly looked good on it, i bet money🤣🤣🤣
Always do the right thing it will came back to u if u do good
Well done mate ...
Let me speak for all straight men and tell you that he returned it cuz he wanted to f$@&
Outstanding young man. That is how you represent yourself and your upbringing.  Take note everyone else his age. Your generation gets a bad rap. Change the narrative
Bravo to this young man! Sure wish there were more people like him.  I'm in Cali dealing with thieves taking my CC the bank send via FedEx from my front door! On two different occasions!  Then,  I mistakenly left my car unlocked last week and someone got in my car and took about $400 of my belongings including my car registration! And I live in gated community!  I'm like Wow! Really! Crazy times! Be safe everyone!
Great rep for the Latin gang
What a great kid
Kids like him will make good parents and then we will have more good kids and so on.
May God continue to bless you young man
Hats off to that young man's parents!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 Y'all raised him right!!! There is still hope for this society! 🙏🏾☝🏽
Ngl, I'd do the same thing no matter how down bad I was. Stealing is wrong, we all know it at heart. But very courteous act to go out of his way to do that. +++
👊❤
Love to see it.
His mom must be so proud of him. Now the whole world is proud of him i hope he always lives a healthy and a good life.
God Bless all the parties involved...
Great young man!!!!!
So sweet nice fella there
This is what people should be Go-funding! something that actually matters instead of sending a bitc that put super glue in her head money lol
That's pretty wholesome
Cry nexixoan hope smike agh rightitings so noice if bac mer
That was so nice of him. There is still hope for everyone to do the right thing. And help and love one another. God bless everyone that helped donate. 💯❤️🙏
There’s HOPE for HUMANITY after all 🤴🏾
I did the same thing as him. Someone once left their purse in a shopping cart, and I saw her walk away, forgetting it, and I grabbed it and handed it to her at her car. I'd appreciate it if someone did the same for me.
What a great guy the world needs more people like him
“Two good reasons”
Que lindo. Aplausos para el! Being raised with integrity to do the right thing even if no one is watching 💪🏽
Beautiful
GOOD JOB IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO GOD LOVE YOU KEEP IT UP
Probably cousins
his moms commision better be like 35%
Super Skit!!!
That is so cool! There is hope.
MAY GOD SHOWER YOU WITH A BEAUTIFUL AND LOVING LIFE FILLED WITH GREAT HEALTH JOY AND HAPPINESS XOXO 😘
Well done kid👍🏾❤️
It feels good to do good things for others!
He returned cause he wanted to hit lol
Good job young man!!!!
It was good but wasn’t 3k dollar  too much
Good job young man, in the world we live in be the difference and do the right thing. Your momma tought you right and she should be proud of you.
While the hell is a good dead getting reported this should be normal
Martine? It's Mar-Tin
That’s some racial profile stuff because it was a white boy returning it then it would just a be normal thing
Good kid
Wonderful story for a change!!
he probably stole it in the first place.
Well done young man👍👍
Honesty is the best policy what a hero.
The Republic has been under attack from its Government an attack from within! since Bush was in office! Treason by Congress Jan 6th, 2021 was on National and world news for everyone to see the Congress-led by Pelosi called the slaughter of an unarmed woman military veteran protecting itself from violent rioters (propaganda) and sent for 30000 armed troops with orders to kill Americans on US soil then wrapped Washington, D.C. in razor wire while they installed the selected not elected President and electoral mechanisms for permanent Congressional power over US citizens and giving support to Globalization of America  It's not about the virus it's about compliance with Authority from the top-down Treason!
The first thing that I noticed is a form of degeneracy of him pulling up his pants. What I find funny is that he knows that it's commonly unaccepted when somebody has their pants down below their butt cheeks. But the whole concept of why people do this in the first place is the form of rebellion that you can get away with as long as you're sure it's long enough. Basically the fact that he looks like a gang member, is strange enough and the problem is, we don't even know whether this woman had her identification stolen or whether this was staged. You see, I don't really think that this is anything to do with racer ethnicity, I think it's completely how the guy is dressed that raises a red flag. At the same time, he may just very well be returning the purse without doing anything wrong. But at the same time, I don't think that this means that there is hope for a younger generation at all. You guys have to understand why the clothing is being worn.
It's a racket he knew he could make more money from returning the purse to the nice neighborhood house than keeping the $35 that were in it, he had it all planned out.
I gotta say it
Blessings 🙌 ❤️🥰
Never judge a player by the game.
Y'all don't judge a book by its cover
Such an amazing man! Have a fruitful life young man!
Incredible Young generation whom parents taught him correctly. 👏  Wonderful.
Even the bible says there is more happiness in giving than receiving. Acts 20:35
She thicc, I'll do the same thing.
I had a similar experience. I was working at my local Wal-Mart years ago, and got called up to collect shopping carts. A lady apparently forgot her purse in her shopping cart when she left. I took the cart with the purse still in it to the courtesy desk. About half an hour later, the lady came back asking if I had seen it. I told her what had happened and she was so happy it was intact. She hugged me before she went to go get it. I couldn't help but blush. :)
He saw that she's hot, so... 😅 My man
Dude looked at the ID, saw a very attractive woman and took it back hoping for sexy time
When you do good you get good poured upon you 💫❤️
Do unto other as you would like them to do unto you. - YAHAWAHSHI (Jesus Christ)
Plot twist-he was the one who took it then felt guilty so he gave it back…
Thanks for this report!
Steve Stifler in American Pie: “Lesbians” YOU GO WE GO 😂😂
He is a hero in my book! We do have hope for the future! Do you hear this parents? Teach your children as his mother taught him and you will be proud of your children and when your time comes to go home you won't worry because you will know you raised them right!
Wonder who let that happen
Why do I love the way he rang the doorbell
I woulda took her shi
😂😂😂 I was wondering why Eliana wasn’t speaking since she was the one who got her stuff rescued, but then she spoke and I didn’t understand a word LOL!!   I love this story tho.
Nice!
It’s hard to find people to trust these days. His mom did a good job!!!
Of course they would say that about him cus his Latino, taking whatever out of the purse
A fine young man.
Good job whoever raised that young man!
Dude looks like Smokey from Friday.
sweet lad such a fine young man hope he has a great life
That is so sweet he returned it. He could have kept it and used her credit cards or something but didn't. 🎉❤
🫡
Awesome ❤️❤️❤️
Well done buddy 👏 👍
He couldn’t keep the purse… it didn’t match his shoes.
😊👍 Thanks for airing this. When we were young, my older brother taught me integrity: We were tent camping in a lonely public campground. The payment system was with cash in a secured metal drop box. However, in this particular campground, the drop box was busted. The next morning, my brother went 20 minutes out of his way to the nearest drop box to make payment (even though our overnight stay wasn't recorded anywhere). Always stuck with me that good people (like young Adrian in this purse story) value a happy life and a good night's sleep) Good on you Adrian😊👍.
if you grew up hispanic you never learned how to look in a womans purse. if ya do, ole abuela gonna get le chancla, thats the reason reason he returned it haha
We need more stories like this pleeeasseeee!! What an amazing person!
Good job kid, never change. You give me hope!
He did it without expecting anything in return. Good kid and obviously raised correctly. If he wasn’t raised correctly than he managed to teach himself what’s right and what’s wrong. Good on him.
It’s a shame that this act is surprising many Americans when it’s supposed to be a regular and normal thing to do.
I miss my mom every day.listen to your ma.
All kids should be like Zdrian!!!! There is hope for society.  Great kid😊
He's good loco
♥️♥️♥️
✅😊
He did a really good thing for them
Awesome young man. 👏
They didn’t say that he got the money
Imagine rewarding someone for being honest. In what world we live in ....
Plot twist:  He was the one who took it
THE SAMARITANS, THE ISRAELITES, YOU CANT MAKE THIS UP!! GOOD FOR YOU BRO!
Staged
🫡
Dope!
That look like the dude from agt who had a bad temper
great young man(and his mom) and very nice gesture from those ladies and donating friends The world is not lost
I hope they gave him a three-way at least
Kudos Youngman may your tribe grows.....salute
A dude returned a lost purse and it made it to national TV ... Bruh I guess doing something as simple as that is rare nowadays
People the story its not real..why they don't show where or when she lost the wallet ? 🤣.
Another go fund me scheme 🤭🤭🤭
This young man is morally and ethically stable and shows what a person should be like. A role model!!
🇲🇽 that’s w
We as a mulims, we do it for nothing. Only we praise Allah reward and acceptance.
Good news 😊
Mans wanted a kiss
Great job adrian
And I got a 10 euro reward for assisting a wealthy jeweler after a (70-80K) robbery. Thanks universe XD
It’s really good that he got a reward for doing a good thing
I found a wallet last summer with 60 bucks in it, I saw who’s it was and asked around until I found him. Didn’t get a reward but it makes you feel good.
Good job honey mamas proud for sure
"Always do the right thing even no one is watching" woww such a good quote he got from her mama 🥹 proud of this young man literally I will remember this quote same as people out there! 🥰 be kind and always helping people cause god will gave you a reward to yourself if you do the right thing to other people 🥰🥰🥰
In the parrrrrrrking lot (paisa bad English)
Good man !
I would of done the same thing because you never know who really need it and plus it would never feel like mine and God would reward me so good job young man.
God is always watching no matter but he did right and that's what we should follow helping each other instead of killing and hurting each other
I’m really proud of this dude! Young kids raised right.
God bless this righteous young man.
Plan A used the credit cards and found out they were canceled.  Plan B. give it back and collect the reward money instead. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Plan C. Let those women show him how to be a man.
It's up to $13,335, he can buy a car or pay for some schooling now
Love this man, gives us a powerful lesson and so do those ladies, their family and friends!  💜💜💜
A true Hero, No Cape or Badge.
don't judge a book by his cover
Lie. He could have been charged for theft. Don't do it. Leave it be.
great Bro ❤️
I woulda brought it back to she bad ash
Those old cougars should of broke him off a little more than just some money If you know what I mean. 😝
The purse: credit cards, lip gloss, and some tampons.
Finally, something good on the news!
That’s the definition of integrity.  I’m happy to see a young man that has it.  It’s disappearing in todays youth.
Who thinks he would have gotten arrested if a cop saw him with that bag? Don't judge a person by their looks!
You know the world is bad when people praise a guy by simply returning a stolen item.
There's hope for our younger generation.... No, no theres not
This is America
Just proves there’s good youths and people black or white in this world !! Such a shame there always labelled or tagged as thief’s or thugs just because of there skin colour  If more people were like this dude the world would be a better place
Kool need more people like him in this world👍🙏
The fact he returned $3000 instead of keeping it and she was ready to give him $20 smh that would’ve changed my situation rq
W son
Love these stories and this is from my city which makes me even more proud 🥲
🥺🥺🥺🥰🥰🥰🥰
He'll yeah bro 💪
extreme chad behaviour, didn't even expect anything in return.
Every person in Denmark would do that, but nice for you 😊
Plot twist: there was nothing of value in it so he just returned it hoping for some reward
I found a phone in a mall and I picked it up to give it to the cashier because it was just lying there and then this woman came in asking about her phone and I assumed it was hers so I tried giving it to her and she just yanked it out of my hands and when I tried to explain that I found it, she gave me a rude sarcastic remark about it and walked away, not even at least a thank you which I know I shouldn’t expect but had I’d actually been horrible, I would’ve smacked it out of her hands for being so rude or said something back but I let her entitled self walk away.
Yes! More people would return stuff like this if people rewarded them! Of course you don’t have too, but someone returning a purse or wallet which can be so much more valuable than $$ I think returning those things deserves something! It doesn’t have too be $3000 of course, but it’s nice to reward someone for a good deed such as this when they could’ve just taken the contents and thrown the purse out idk 🤷🏻‍♀️ just me?
Good kid deserves a reward
i usually skip this part
As I get older, I tear up so easily! But that was touching because he listened to his mother. And I tell my boys the same thing. Always have integrity.  Do the right thing even when you don't think anyone is watching, and do unto others like you want to be done unto. Great Job Mom! And a lesson learned that great wisdom is rewarded literally and figuratively!
I did the same thing  I found the phone at the bus stop and I gave to the lady .
California man
Turns out he thought the chick on the ID was hot and wanted to clap them cheeks that's why he returned it
Amazing boy! Best mother! Good people to acknowledge him💗
Finally! Something not terrible on the News. Good Mom raising a good young man who was generously rewarded for being genuinely good.
I think what is more depressing is everyone acting like this  shoukd be out of character for a young latin boy….and assume they would have just kept it…to the point where his good deed was so out of the “ordinary” that it made the news…  Thats more of a story than this young man doing the right thing…
it's just common sense to return someone else's property though, why question it? 😂
One his homies stole dat purse n he just tryn collect his money
Me personally I wouldn’t had took that 3k just because it defeats the  purpose of doing something nice for someone but im glad the guy got some money back for it
Yea one his homies stole dat purse n he just tryn collect his money 💰 🤣
One good deed may not bring back hope for the younger generation.
Wow this is amazing his mom is so proud of him I’m sure some of his friends called him stupid for not keeping the purse with money but he listen to him self n got recognition good for him.
So good to see people do the right thing.👍
This is awesome! I hope this young man is able to do something good with his money. 😀
But here’s the flip, he’s the one who stole it
What an amazing young man! Kuddos to his mom for instilling such great values into him.
GREAT YOUNG MAN
This used to be commonplace.   Now, it's a newsworthy event.
he's 17 they gave him 3k if he were to give that 3k to his mom he would still her about 3mil for taking care of him 😂 jk good job bro
Back when I was growing up this was expected not to be rewarded.  Goes to show how much societal norms have changed
Great kid for sure😊❤️
I swear I work for Amazon found so many wallets and returned them
My man just tryna chase a bag
His mom raise him right 👍
A few years ago, my son went to a yearly parade and festival in our home town for the first time without me to just hang out with some friends.  I received a phone call from a young man saying he found a wallet with my name and number in it for emergencies.  He said he had found it on the ground by a food vendor truck and could bring it to me if I wanted.  I had him wait till I called my son and merged the calls.  Since they were both still at the event, they were able to find each other.   Now this young man could’ve taken the money and said that’s the way he found it or not even contacted me at all, but every dollar was accounted for!  My son had just cashed his very first paycheck from his first after school job, so it meant a lot to him.  My son wanted to give him a reward, but he wouldn’t take one, just asking him to pay it forward when he could.  To be honest & not trying to brag, I have seen my son pay it forward several times since then and am so proud!
So i mean i have door cam, anyone wants to come with a purse so i can film it? We make a nice donations section and split 50/50 ?
Amazing thing what he did but $3000? What tf that's the dumbest thing I've heard. Good for him tho
Great story great young man
He so cute 🥺🥺❤️❤️
I’d be happy with just Melina sitting on my face or doing one of those stepmom stuck in the dryer scenes.
May this be an example to you, you lil mfers
Praise God for this young man. May God bless him and continue to use him to influence other young people in doing service for The King in this dark world where truth has fallen in the streets, where many do not know Jesus, for He is coming soon!
He just like me
We need more kids like him in the future 💛
Well done!
He was raise RIGHT God bless his Mother she have a caring responsible young man he will go long in his life nuh respect to him si
From a man perspective  after seeing the girl pic in her purse i think he was hoping some actions..you know what i mean 😁
Good things happen to people that do the right thing.
Now maybe he can buy a belt
We need more thinkers, mom, people that cares to the world, and him haha
It went viral bc of what he looks like
He would receive more money taking it instead 🤔
There is good teens in this world for sure.. Bless him
👍
you sure he didn’t try to steal it then return it to look “good”
Aww what an amazing young man. I pray blessings pour upon him all throughout his life. He deserves the best of everything ❤  Good job young man and what a wonderful way to honor your momma too!! Showing how much love and care she put into raising you. This made my heart swell with love and hope!
We definitely need more of this and a change in our selfish culture in the states. In Japan this is normal every day and 9 time outta 10 your stuff is brought back to you, left where it was, or took to a lost and found so you can retrieve it.
His parents I'am sure is very proud of him.
He probably looked in it to see if there was anything valuable but there wasn't and decided to return it to look heroic.
Gd young man right there
A rare young man, momma definitely raised him right.
His parents raised him right.💙💕🥰
Good on him for being a Man of Integritty. Well done to his Mum for instilling in him a strong moral conscience.  Ultimately though,  he was the one who chose to follow through on her teachings with his own actions.  Good man.!!!Xxx
My man saw that lady’s picture on the license and just had to see her in person🤭😂👌🏾
Hats off to that boys mother. As parents, we control the future.
No his mama made him give it back!!
he really just came out to check the cameras lol
This should be the norm........so glad to live in another country where it actually IS the norm.
Thanks to his mom who raised him really good. He will become a good man!!
Good kid. But I wonder how many people will start stealing purses and returning them for the money.  No way there was $3,700 in the purse.
I don’t think that’s his parents, or his upbringing, or anything. I think he’s just a honest to goodness good kid with a good soul. I’m glad he was rewarded for his good deed. I wish him tremendous success in life so that he may be able to bless himself and those around him. Good job young man.
Never underestimate teenagers
Only newsworthy in the us.
i want this kid to be my son in-law... how can i find him?
what have we become, this is what is supposed to be normal, but it's so unusual that everytime it happens, a video has to be made about it
He saw the Baddie on the ID and thought his PHub dream gonna come True lol
Bravo you g  an.
his GoFundMe is up to 13k.....
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Wouldn't anyone with a good heart do this? I don't think the GoFundMe was necessary at all, a small reward from the owner at most.
Don’t Judge a book by its cover.
Words can’t describe how happy this made me!! There is hope for humanity. God Bless this young man.
good for you young man he deserved every penny👏
Imagine he was going to steal but it had nothing in it lol
salute to this young man, raised well by his parents.
Good news
Is this really tv news worth?
We need more people to raise their kids like this!! His mama did an amazing  job rasing this young man!
Great parenting = great young man
I would love to have more young men like him in our society with strength of character. He's a refreshing role model.
"There's hope for our younger generation."
I would do the same thing as well but i would tell them to keep the money
Excellent behavior, nice and honest young man, I once found a wallet on the ground full of credit cards and whatnot, took the elevator and gave it to the frontdesk lady from the medical office I was visiting.
Plot twist  :  he is the same guy who stole the bag and now he is playing the good type .
Excellent character. This should make us all want to do better.
OMG 😍 in CT 10 years back I had a non-english speaking older male return my purse to me with nothing much left except MY CDL LICENSE - thank goodness!! I have to have my license on me in order to work 😓  I was trying to communicate how to get in touch with him later to give him $20 (my cell phone was gone too). I said no cellular and no deneiro (showed empty pockets) but he said no no is okay 😭  He found it in the town I was at the night before & still got it to me… I am forever grateful to him 💯♥️
W Teen we love to see it
Shoulda let him smash as reward
A fine young man. Thank you
Cool!
I found a couch purse in a buggy we drove 30 minutes out of our way to bring it back. The house was huge the teen girl answered the door. She was confused I told her were we found it an she didn't even know it was missing 🤣
What a good man 👏 … couldn’t be me, sorry 😅
That’s  a big example of where the EDUCATION begins….. from home !!!!!!
If he was a year older no one would care
This made my heart happy!
That's called building Character by doing the Right thing when Nobody's Looking🤝
Good
Fine young man💀☠️
Awesome!  He's a thoughtful young man. A good person
100 dollars to a Bag of peanuts there was no cash in it. I'm sure he looked lol

Whats next, we applaud people that say thank you?
Good job kid

Edgar saved the day!
Eliana Artifacial
It makes you feel good to know there people like this young man out in the world.
Props to this young gentleman.
I put money on it this kid robs $hit on the regular. His @$$ saw her picture on the license n went "This chicks hot, I'll return this one". Now he's gettin his "Souqa De Mink" on; Also what 17yr old has an Audi from actual hard work???
there is no hope for the next generation. look arround u??!!  you want these people to gain power?? lolll good parenting this era was....
We need more stories like this
That’s not a good samaratin.  That’s just doing the right thing.
🙌for this young man
Fine young man will make a nice human happy as their partner one day. <3
hope for OUR younger generation? wish we could say the same for having hope within the older generation
The karma this kid receives will last him for years to come. Good job Mom! You taught your boy well!
Makes me believe in people a little again
Legend
He deserved this.
He looks cool and acts cool
❤❤❤
Central cee???
Awesome job young man!
Theres,the answer right there grow a child in the way it should be grown. Starts from the home. Parents your responsible. This is how humans should live amongst each other there would be no lack ! Too many greedy selfish people that should be seperated from the good its called heaven . God is good
I would’ve returned it too, just without any money
young fine man 😦
We need more people in this world like this young man! God bless him and whoever raised him.
You do good things. Good things come after you.
this makes me angry since nobody returned my wallet😢😢😢
The current go fund me is at 13k as of today July 3rd 2022 !!!
Great Character is defined when you do the right thing when no one else is looking.
Good job Adrian!!!!! God bless you!!!❤️❤️❤️
"Yo dawg, there's only tampons and maxed out credit cards in here, you can have your purse back"
nothing like a nice milf..
Don't judge by his looks
"Treat others the way you'd like them to treat you."
Man saw the milf and said: "I gotta check her out" i bet he would like to have another "reward"
Sad that such a small act of kindness is shocking to people and seen as a heroic act. This should be the norm 🥲
This should be in the News as a headline.
Nice man
Never judge a book by the cover 👍🏻 great young man ❤️
That boy has a good parents with a good manners....one example of a good person. This fine young man is what the world needs.
Go fund me is a great example of what the people can do when they come together
My guy saw the girl on the license and was like dayummm .. I gotta go see her in person 😅
💙💙💙💙
Bro he just saw a milf on the ID and wanted to come over & now he getting $4,000 too 🤣
Integrity
Milf vajajas
“Fine young man”😂😂 boi you know he got some
God bless this young man. His mother must be so proud.
That’s amazing because I hardly think he’s old enough to know how fkn difficultttttttttttt it is to get all those cards ID back  I’d be absolutely screwed without mine this is a reminder to fix some things myself lol
Good man. Great parents.
He deserved every single dollar of his reward! Man, you're awesome!
Most people would say he looks like he would steal it but he doesn’t he looks good and he is.
It speaks a lot about him and who raised him.
Great job to his mom.
very good job young man! i know your jefita is very proud of you.
Damn,  should really go return that watch I stole 10 years ago….
My goodness, his parents must be so proud, I salute this young man, and God bless mama
how do u leave yo purse in a shopping cart and forget about it?
Wow…… “and everyone is watching” God bless you young man
😍
I would hit.
That kid will have a rich and rewarding life..and I’m not talking financially.
He is all class
Common decency is now extraordinary
La honestidad es benimna y Reconpensadora
no... there is no hope in the younger gen. just lucky he was a good guy
I want to hug him 🤗
I saw a story like this one in Brazzers but it ends differently! 🤣
That’s a burkin
See it's not about the way you cloth, so many people assume if you have this kind of fashion type they judge to quickly and assume your a gangster or criminal
Tell me why I really think this kid already knew who the purse belonged to and only reason he took it back was thru perverted thought lmfao kid said damn I might get a date out of this hahaha
Good samaritan
He’s a down ass foo 📈💯
That’s a good foo 💯👌🏾
He's drowning with drugs now
Don't find people like him...but be a person like him
What a good kid.
God bless you Adrian 🙏 ❤
He's a good man his parents raised a good man
He just wanted to raise his honor level
In America this is strange thing to do, overseas it's just a normal day
This guy deserves a lot more attention, and he is indeed getting it little by little.
I knew a crossing guard once that found a purse with someone's tax check over $5,000 in it. She returned the purse and the newspaper did a story about her returning it. Would you return it if it had that much cash inside?
Honestly I would be the same as his, Mum raised me right and if that happened to me I'd pray someone would find my stuff and return it.  A good deed doesn't need a reward, but in return if a gift is made it's always a pleasant gesture.
And he’s an Latin American ❤️ so for allllll the Karen’s and Becky’s with good hairs,stop calling them thief’s pls not all is the same..Love from Europe ❤️💙🤍
What a great kid!! His mom did a fabulous job raising him.
🤣🤣🤣if it were me and my goons brh, to us that shi pussy as shi
That's amazing
That is awesome
It’s good to know there’s people that do this type of stuff everyday with no praise or reward. This guy wasn’t expecting a 3k  reward he was just doing what’s right
This was nice to watch especially on the world that we're living in great job young man
God bless this young man! His momma raised him right!
Good people raise good kids. And God gives grace. He has a good mom.
There was a woman in my hometown, she picked up about 1400$ and asked how much would she be “rewarded” after returning it 🤨 the money ended up being returned to the owner but 90$ was “disappeared”
Wow what a sweet baby
Definitely her brother
What a nice young man
I remember when I found a wallet outside a supermarket and it had like 300 in it and I gave it to security and they asked for my name and number but the owner never bothered calling me to thank me for it.
This is how I was raised.  So glad to see a young man from the more recent generation has good virtue and moral standing.  Good parenting with excellent results.
Kid has integrity. Mom raised him right
he didnt want money he wanted...cough cough....lady fine as heaven
It’s so sweet that these women’s family were also so ready to show gratitude. It’s all about passing the love back and forth as many times as possible, that’s how you make it grow ❤️
Honestly I thought who is talking the mother and the other the daughter
I guess when they say don't judge a book by its cover this is what they mean because I wouldn't look at that guy and think he would be the type to return a purse.
Credit to the parents who raised this fine gentlemen right!! thats something that is in short supply these days!!!
This makes me cry with happiness bc of all the hatred and sad terrible things going on in this world. Good boys and girls still exist amongst the very bad attitudes and hatred. Thank you Adrian for doing the right thing. ☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️
what goes around comes around! Thank you to the parents of this young man!😊
What a good kid man  someone mailed me my wallet I lost and had been looking for for days
It’s crazy how we live in such a sick world that the common sense thing to do is praised this heavily. All this really shows is how sick this world is. In my opinion it doesn’t really say much about the kid, that should be the bare minimum standard.
How deserved is this young man - with a huge HONEST HEART - love it. Here in Brisbane Australia  Someone returned my handbag to the local police station who rang me & I got everything back including $50note + coin of $3 .40 cents. They never left a name or phone number so I WILL SAY A HUGE THANK YOU TO THAT PERSON/S MAY YOUR LIFE BE BLESSED,  LOTS OF GOOD LUCK & MAY YOUR GOD PROTECT YOU. from a very grateful Brisbane-ite.
How to be a legend and get all the girls 🤣🤣
How much was inside the bag
It's videos like these that restores my faith in humanity, but then that faith blows out the window again when kids eat tide pods or adults gorilla glue their hair
Scam!! 😂 When will you guys learn..!!
Lord bless this boy and his family 🙏
Wow this sucks.....now your just teaching people to do things to expect money when your promote things like this
Let me guess, he is in a gang and they stole it then asked him to return it for the reward
Turns out he actually stole it just to reap the reward
Theres good people out there..just Open youre eyes..
This made news? This happens quite often where I am from
What an angel :)
Cool..
It's always a positive when people carry out considerate acts but it's also a reflection on society when we feel the urge to reward even the simplest acts with thousands of dollars, viral videos, gushing comments and tv news features. It feels we expect so little of each other that when we see virtue we go overboard. Recently, a man giving someone $5 ended up being rewarded with over $100k. Anyone seeing that may become resentful when their own kind act isn't rewarded similarly. Or people may be carrying out virtuous acts in anticipation of the large rewards they may receive. I don't think we do people favors by over-rewarding and we should keep some semblance of moderation in mind. Virtue is, as they say, its own reward.
Thank You Young Man For Making My Entire Heart Smile! ❤️
Everyone have kind heart its just they needed the right people to guide them
Good deed by the young man. But I must admit being a bit puzzled at the gofundme and the news report.  Returning someone else's lost items should be considered as perfectly normal. The fact that this makes the news, says a lot about the society we live in.
Made my day much better. 🫡
Gods work❤️💥
I would have settled for a night with Eliana.
So far the gofundme donations reached $13,2K
Yes he’s a beacon of hope and a good soul but observing many of the youths today he’s like one in ten or a hundred and that’s depressing and so is my comment but if it’s true then oh well…🌈
Very cool act. Glory God in Lord Jesus Christ name!
he is latino yall
Beautiful story!
Honesty is best policy 👍
And all this miracle in front of cameras.
hahaha, it's so funny. I remember i did this once too. a guy came from Spain to Copenhagen and forgot his backpack with his valuables, password, and 950euros in it. I took the bag and sought and called back and forward for him for 3.5 days. I found him the last day he was about to leave the country. As i gave it to him, he just ripped it out of my hands and just gave me a (i don't care) "thanks". And i was like, what an ahole.... oh well, thats lifeXD
I think he saw how beautiful the woman was on the drivers license and was like wow I need to see her in person
This is the 1000th purse he returns back and probably the first time getting something around 3k+
🙏 GREAT JOB PARENTS ON HAVING SUCH A STAND UP YOUNG MAN!
my god, he just did a good deed.... give him a knighthood
This gave me chills and tears
What a handsome, kind young man. I hope he gets rewarded tenfold for this good deed.
He driving audi. He don't need your purse lol
Good person!
Never judge a book by it's cover. This is the type of young guy many would love at assume but clear to see who he is from his actions.  💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
its 13k now and counting :) :)
plot twist he only brought the purse bacc because there was only $30 and a half-smoked pacc of Marlboro’s
Honest lad excellent
This is the only type of News I will watch.  Positive news.
Inside edition made 30k usd for 4millon views
He’d definitely snitch in an interrogation
hes cute
Way to go young man and great job to the parents. This shows that he respected his mom and her advice.
"To do the right thing even when no one  is watching" - that is the real and simple definition of INTEGRITY!!!!
Chad Rodriguez. What a cool dude. For real tho, integrity starts early with mom, dad and spider-man. "With great power comes great responsibility." This mans got it.
good people still exist.. he's going far in life
Not gonna lie the lady that lost her purse is fine asf that’s a milf right there
Imagine if they kept the GoFundMe.   But really that guys awesome!
Amen to that teen lots respect from my point of view
Good man💪🏼
He looks so cute and awkward with that purse haha
Well done 👍🏻 Greetings from Scotland 🌻 Have a wonderful day everyone ❤️
You can clearly see that the USA is failing when something this normal is so special in a Country. The USA won't made the 21th, the downfall is already there
This is so dope💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Feel good moment. Hell yea!!
Plot twist. He stole the purse
God bless his soul 🙏🏻💙🥰..i want man like this by the way ...physical appearance is not important to me, only the soul...
What a lovely young man...honest with integrity...kudos to him for doing the right thing...God bless 🙏
He’s so fine bro
Amazing to hear for once
This is what we need more, good people all round
This vatò is a real OG
What an amazing young man.
Beautiful Soul 👍
Naw 3k is crazy 🤯
This is so amazing!! God Bless Adrian , his parents and the ladies  💯💯💯🏆
I returned a wallet but didn't get nothin for it but if I found something like that again I'll still return it that guy is lucky he found her purse that 3 grand was a come up id be like nah I can't take that much 20 bucks I would've been happy with that
What has this society become? Doing the right thing can make the news
This is so nice of him and the way he’s holding the purse is so cute 🤣❤️ sending him all the love in the world
Wow... We need more like this young  boy..
He is change . Respect to his mother
Inside Edition: 17-Year-Old Returns Woman’s Lost Purse and Gets $3K Reward  Biden:  I can do that everyday *continues* *falling* *from* *his* *bike*
THAT IS A REAL MAN!!!!
Love this ❤️
The women only did all that extra stuff cus he look good if he was ugly they wouldn’t have did none of it
Love this. He was raised the right way.
This young man was properly raised by his mama. As always, Do unto others ...... His mother must be so proud!
99% that kid stole it and returned it for the reward.
If I saw a fine women like her in the driver’s license. I’d return it myself. If she was not my form of attractive I would have given it to the police and let them deal with it.
dude can literally buy a gibson
I found some keys laying outside the other day and I grabbed them because I didn't want someone's car being stolen (I live in St. Louis). The next morning, I tried to find out who they belonged to...looking at all the Kia's parked on the street and asking a neighbor who's car belongs to who. I finally found it belonged to one of my Mexican neighbors. I asked him what color the key chain was just to make sure it was actually his, and he thought I was holding the keys ransom for money!!  I told him I just wanted to make sure they went to the right person. I was pretty shocked though that he thought I (or anyone) would do that.
What a relief, there’s still good young men in our country still.
May God bless him and his mom 🙏🏾.
S/o to The young king Adrian fr
That was very nice God Bless him
Homie was just tryna pork with his pork sword 🗡
Well he shouldn't have taken the money, he spoiled his good deed
GoFundMe Raised over $13,000, now thats good karma.
Or, he saw the drivers license and thought: "She hot, let me try to play my cards right".
Hes mamma brought him up the right way👍😎🌹
Think this is rare? Japan has a 90% returned of lost personal artifacts to their respective local Police Station.  Seriously not making this up.  Youtube it or google it.  - Great young man, good deed, rewarded  handsomely.
When you reward someone 3k for doing something that’s considered common courtesy.
If he first wouls have nicked it and then changed his mind, or if he would have walked in a snow storm a day to deliver it, that could've been a story. This is just silly. Who has not returned things similar to this kid.
They wouldn't have answered the door for a black kid
update: over $13K have been donated
perrito was just trynna smash
This normal here in my country, everyone return anything they find
Kids mother taught him integrity.
good karma is very rewarding
💯💯💯
Boy was dying for nyasshhh
❤️❤️
Pretty sad that this has to be spotlighted, when this should just be the norm!
There's still hope for us 🙏
Good! He deserves it!
Positive vibes
God bless him I been there
Good Guy 🤍
I returned many things to people but why no one rewarded me.😔
Oh, so you should steal someone purse without them noticing and then return it yourself to get a reward
Months later EBAY charge on her Discover card revealed a purchase of a PS5 Bundle package.....   Just Kidding
Nice story. My mom lost her wallet once. Fortunately, the finder called her since her number was written in some card inside the wallet. BUT all the cash was gone, they even asked for more  as a "reward" and we realized later where she had lost the wallet and that these people stood only a few meters away, had probably seen her drop her wallet and instead of telling her waited until we were gone to then make money off of it...
I Honestly Thought That Lady Was Pretentious At First
That boy was raised right!
Never judge a book by its cover 😉 smart kid
What a wonderful young man
OG MOVE
Faith in humanity restored
They didn't say how much money is in the purse, it's probably none
after that he killed 4 people in a gang shoot out
Nah my guy saw her I’d picture and hoped to get a different type of reward
How terrible US is? That just common sense!!
I love this so much ❤️
I have subscribed!!!
The real hustle is he originally took it, pretended he found it and instead of getting like 100 bucks from the purse he got nearly 4k, Jokes aside this is just being human and not a rodent to society.
Good loterry give you good rewards
He would've gotten a bigger reward if he didn't return it.
It’s wonderful he did that but why do you guys have to overly reward every good deed? This should be normal.
This is beautiful!!
Good kid being rewarded. It’s always good to return a wallet or purse. I was in Sequoia National Park in California and found a man’s wallet. He had lots of credit cards so I called his CC bank to let him know I found it. That didn’t work so I just sent it to the address on his driver license hoping his address was updated. When I arrived home in VA there was card in the mail with a $200 check thanking me for returning it.
Philippines Here, Good Job Boy I Salute to your Honesty, your Parents so Proud Of You, Stay Safe, Stay Chill....This is a Inspirational for Youth.....Keep it Up Your Doing Good....You Have an Angel to Guide you Sir...Hello Maam Dad...Keep your Kid Safe Always....
"There's Hope for our younger generation" seems a bit judgmental to me.
Beautiful!!!!
Idk Why everyone is shoked I thought everyone knew that its something a human should do?
Fun twist: the purse alone worth usd 18,000
Those lips damn 😂😻😻
For GOD so Loved the world that He Gave His One and Only Begotten Son JESUS CHRIST, so that anyone who Believes in Him will not perish but have Eternal Life (John 3:16)
Damnn she bad 😍 he wanted the @ 🤣
Very rare this happens
I love this❤️
Love your neighbor as yourself! Poetry in motion!
bless this dude !
Rock’n’Roll young man.
Good kid
God bless y’all ❤️❤️
What his Mom taught him is something I live by....Do the right thing even when no one is watching! I love it that that young man grasped that. Hope great things come his way!✌🤙🙏
There's still hope for that kid*
$3K for basic human decency....noice👍
In real life he was just looking for a three-way, he saw both their IDs
They talking more about two womans than guy who helped
Stories like this gives me a little hope on humanity. That young man did the right thing🙏
HAHAHAHA THATS SO CUTE
😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏
Thank you for sharing this little snippet of goodness . I needed this 2 mins in my life 😊
There still is hope for great Nation. This young man proves it!!
Wow nice of him
Another win for honest pepole.
Good Parents = Good Child
Nice  way of thinking  👍🏽👍🏽
It's normal to do that, nothing to celebrate to much
He was tryna come inside and eat tacos
we need more people like this in this world 👍👍👍👍👍👍
The world needs more young people like this ❤️
Let him smash
Good bless them ppl
و يرزق الله من يشاء بغير حساب ...
Dont judge people by their looks.
Do American driver’s licenses show the actual address on the card? Here in Europe no address is shown on the drivers license
I want my son to be just like that👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾❤️
My names Adrian we good people 😊
Moral of the Story :- All kids with Tattoo and wearing wrong sided hat aren't bad...
I like this🧡
I normally skip this part
I know what bro really wanted to happen 😂😂🤣
His mother is a wise woman, mines was the same she always said 'if you always  do the right thing no one will ever prove you wrong'.
$13 100 as of now.
I once walked almost 2 miles to a hospital to give an old lady the phone back that her granddaughter, who was hospitalized, lost on a bus station. Almost broke my heart when she wanted to give me money, I didn‘t want to accept it, but she didn‘t want to make go without a reward so I accepted it in the end. Poor lady.
Well done kid
My man looks like a Total thug who could steal your Purse but was an Absolute angel from inside.
People make it seem like there aren't good people anymore. Not everyone is a piece of garbage.
I love it and god bless them both 🙏
How did he know where they lived?
Plot twist : The purse was empty 👎  But the owners house was on the way home , might as well return it 👍
plot twist she had no money in the purse thats why he return it
Man I am proud of him🥺🙏🤍
Don’t judge a book by its cover
As much criminality we see on the news their is more good people than criminals but media never show the good people bc it doesn’t fit with their lil agendas
Go fund me did him right
Honestly I thinks it’s sad that doing the right thing is news-worthy. It should kinda be expected of people.
Random victims in GTA 5😭
Homies trying to get his honor level up 💀💀💀
In Germany we would call him “Ehrenmann“
He dropped it back cuz she hood looking
He looks and dresses like those dudes who would just ransack the purse and take whatevers in it but then hey don't judge a book by its cover. His mama raised him right. She must be really proud of him❤
this guy should get a full ride or at least some type of college scholarship . The world needs more people with principles to have college degrees and hopefully eventually occupy positions of influence where they can make a difference
We Need More Of Theses Kids . Thanks  MUM
He fine
Basic for asian kid
So cool!!!😁💕
This teen is 1 in a million.. hope this world will be filled up more like him ❤️
That happened to my wife and I this weekend. We had to hit the ATM and we found a wallet with a elderly ladies credit cards, bank cards and her drivers license on the side of the ATM. She only lived about 10 blocks from us so we took it back to her. The only difference is her daughter accused my wife of pick pocketing this lady. We did not know her, we did not see her, it was just her wallet at the side of the ATM. Then her daughter accused my wife of stealing $2000.00 for the inside of her purse. That is when the elderly lady told her daughter to shut up and stop making up stories. I guess her daughter stole her moms wallet, went to the ATM and took out $2000.00 and forgot where she left her mothers wallet. I told my wife that if it ever happens again just to leave it there and do not touch it.
Raising a good man or woman starts at home! Bless his mama !
Mumma raised a KING.
🥰
It wasn't his colour bag anyway..
BZ
Good boy raised well by his parents..
🙏🙏🙏😱🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
I think she fell in love with him 😆
a few Years back i lost a Part from my Motocycle, and while i was searching the Spot where i thought it fell off, i found a Black Purse from an Older Woman (the Spot was in the middle of nowhere, no Houses or something around), there was no Money inside but all of her Cards like Drivers Licence, ID and so on, after reaching out to her to return the Stuff she told me, she was already at the Police Station and has been told that on this Day some others got their Stuff stolen aswell while shopping, so the empty Purse was just dumped there, but she was very happy she got the Rest back. It`s just the right thing to do, when you find someone elses Stuff to return it, and as this Video shows you can get rewarded for doing so.
Mate my dog went off when he rang that doorbell 💀
Wow. When he become a parent someday I'm pretty sure he'll raise a very well mannered, honest, and respectful person. He's the kind of person that the world need
The GoFundMe is currently at $13,185 USD
He deffo seen the picture on the ID and thought sheeeeeet, ima find this woman 😍
This is ma boy right here !!! Much respect and love from manila
People in the US reached a time where doing what’s normal is heroic and odd.. let that sink for a moment.
King 🤴
Not some good deeds, ALL good deeds eventually come around
He’s among the 2% of Americans
This should be on the news , not negative story’s
Apartheid is practiced by the Israeli government and the western world does nothing. Rich western Jews support Israeli Jews to wipe out an entire race.
Great guy
This one of a kind
He's been raised well, his mum must be proud
This is incredible story. What you teach you child show in his/he life.
So steal a purse then pretend you found it and bring it back for a reward and praise. Got it
he checked the purse she was broke so he brought it back to look good
what a g
IF HE WOULD HAVE TOOK WHAT WHATEVER WAS IN THE PURSE IT WOULD HAVE BECOME BAD   DONT MESS WITH KARMA LAW   ALWAYS DO THE RIGHT THING  EVEN IF YOU DONT GET NOTTING  IN RETURN
thankful her purse was brought back- now she can get that oh so needed botox
GTA V Random Events
Saw the picture on the driving license and thought thaas wassup
Wow seems so special in America to return a purse but in Singapore it’s pretty normal. Many people get their lost stuff returned.
Ayo if i saw that DL pic i would return it too😂😂😂😂all jokes lol
hope he will use it to buy crypto
Latinos speaking en Inglés... 🤔 Entre ellos...
He wasn’t dragged he was raised
They should have smashed
Lets be relistic he was hoping to get some a$$
It’s at $13,000 now … he deserves it all
He is also taking a risk of being accused of stealing it.
W
That was a cool thing he did
Respect!
He saw the ID of a hot older chick. He was hoping to get laid. 🤣
We all know if this was some white kid it wouldn’t be on the news. This is crazy
the fact that this was on the news says a LOT about the common thought of finding something that belongs to someone else
Goodness has no nationality. Goodness is skin deep. I feel proud of this boy. Blessed is the womb that carried good, kindhearted people.
For western people this is so shocking lmao...here everyone is like this..nothing surprising
I swear that’s that glad u came guy
fk the reward, ill ask for a 3some 😂
Not everything shown on the news is Bad... Kudos to the kid.
Wow so brace I can't  do that unbelievable as Well done to the Teenager 17 roger rego I am surprised that he would go that way to do such a kind thing to a person he didn't know and give back their purse to their house.   I ❤️ the kidness you did to reach out and say you dropped your purse toad retern it to its true owner.
This is the America I know and love.  He is a good young man and deserves to be rewarded even though he did not expect a reward.
staged
We need more teenagers, kids and adults just like this
Lol of course you’re going to return it if there’s some babes photo ID all through it 😂
I did something like this not too long ago myself.  I was sitting down, facing an ATM machine and when I looked at the ATM machine, I saw cash sticking out ($350), I grabbed it and ran to my mum who was getting ready to enter her work, I gave it to her so I could work out where the security office was so we could work out who it belonged to. When I found it and told them, my mum gave back the cash and we found the woman who left it (she’s a bit disabled in the brain so that’s probs why she forgot it)  Ever since then I get a lot of smiles from the people that saw what I did. (They were shocked a teenager was honest tho lol)   Do the right thing if you want the same respect back.
*Mission passed* *Respect++++*
simp
And that’s how you trick someone into giving you money 😂😂
This was a set up hahaha
maah man just wanted a MILF
Bro was tryna hit 💀
Aww he cute
So these entitled women didn't give him a penny. Wow! Pathetic
Haha homie was tryna just meet the lady, she look good
I love this story.  I just wish it was this type of story regarding young people that dominated the news.  I’m certain most parents aim for their child to behave like this.
I had to do this. A lady bought something off me from Facebook and left her purse on my truck and I had to find her which her ID address didn't match so I had to snoop and she had like $700, luckily I found her and was able to return it. I'm still surprised someone walking up the road didn't see it and snatch it
Iv done this many times....why is it a big deal?
Man this is one of the best videos yet. Adrian should be a role model for kids. He deserves this attention. Good on him and good on his parents!
I helped him find it
Good job..my boys would do this!
I did this for someone in Tampa the other week. Found their drivers license at a dog park. Drove into the city to hand deliver it to their condo. Never heard from them. Maybe my karma is still up and coming 😂🤷‍♂️😫
Grandma's always have 1 million in their pockets Change my mind
Good deed 🙏buddy 👍 respect from India 🇮🇳
Last week of June my friend lost $2000 plus a wallet at a Walmart in Lakewood/Long Beach ......   So far, no good Samaritan..
Good lad
He's cute tho
I’d return it and get stabbed tbh
Plot twist: The I.D showed they lived in a rich neighborhood.
GIGACHAD
One day my friend he was riding a bicycle to go to work he lost his pass, he was apply everything new then like one month he was siting on chair at front door he feel something it was his pass with everything even his $200
Just proves even more you should never judge a book by its cover. What an awesome story and even more awesome 17yo boy
He’s Raza too mad respect 🫡
Would’ve got her number 🥴
Habibi come to India you will see it everyday.Once my father also returned someone's 1 lakh rupee.
He def stole a couple bucks before returning the purse💀
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Kind gesture
I returned a wallet at a airport I worked at once.
Good dude maybe still hope for the world
I love good people
You know what they say, never judge a cover by its book. Idk if I said it right but I think my point went through regardless.
Salute
Love to see it. ❤️❤️❤️ Great job young man.
He is cuteeeeee
Book, cover, you know...

Man he fine asf and kind?!? AAHHH I NEED ME A MAN LIKE THAT
My dirty mind read the caption as sex reward. Oh Lord forgive me...
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
This foo is from the hood, that right my boii
find it kinda crazy how the world is so cruel where this kinda stuff shocks us on how we can still find good people. the guy proved that they’re still good people out there
Perhaps there is hope?
God Bless Him and His Future💯❤️❤️🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
👍👍👍
This dude makes my heart warm
I’d be a extremely proud parent. I’d add another 3K to as his father
What a good guy 😃 His momma raised him right.
This is normal human behavior in the rest of the world. America: Its a miracle !!!!
Good kid. Maybe he can buy a belt now 😂
kudos to the ones who raised him.. and to him as well for being a gentelman.
Just because a teen wears a baggy pants had his hat on backwards like a GANGSTA like, it doesn't mean that he's a bad person. There's more than meets the eyes. """ Much Respect For this teen."""" He's going to be somebody one day.
Awesome 👏
He was finna shoot his shot with ol girl in the back
And judo know!
Good lad 👍
Faith in humanity restored
Omg
Actually he saw her ID picture and thought maybe see is single. That would be my reason.... Shame on me!!
W human
No way I would of took the cash and credit  cards.
once i lost 7k in thailand on the first day of the holiday,the tuktuk driver found my hotel and bring it back.
How very sweet that guy is pretty cool that lady got her purse back awesome I would do this exact same thing if somebody lost something I would help them find it
He the kind of kid who get rejected by women becuase he’s no street dude slanging that Yayo. Funny in the world we live now! I feel for the younger generation! But glad he’s a good kid! Even when no one is looking
Did the same thing in gta and killed the owner, got the reward and her money
His mama raised him well, kudos to her!
He is fineeetoo
🧢 if their was over 5-10k in the bag he wouldn’t return it but good job to him for returning a bag with only $20 🥱
Plot twist, there was nothing in it
Dear God: please bring more people like him into this world especially this poor new generation we live in. I would’ve done th same tbh
Fake news
Thank you brother💙☘️
Nah he definitely hit
Go fund me at 13k now
Nice to hear a heartwarming story. Such a lively young man. His mom raised him right.
A true Gentleman..
hes kinda
Nice, well done.
Yes good parenting it starts at home well done mom it will go a long way Eve his kids he will teach them the same ❤️❤️🙌🙌🤩🤩

That's the best example how good parenting make good people. Well done BOY 👍🏻 ONE LOVE
I once returned a 2,500 check to the owner and didn't even get a thanks, he had the looked of wtf is he doing with my check so I told him I found it on the floor a**hole
Wow,  good boy
Kind of crazy how a regular dude is being praised for doing what he was supposed to do... What does that say about the rest of you
90% of 17 year old teens would of 100% stole it, proud of my generation in this one
This makes my day! Love this video!!
That’s someone I would hire and accelerate into management. Great example of integrity.
W dude and his mom for raised him right
Grasias
He know what he was doin😭😭😂
Stand up dude nothing but good karma coming to you my brotha respect
Honesty is key in life
What a great mom teaching her son to always do the right thing. Good job young man. We need more people like you.
I wish I was the kid giving that purse back easy 3k .
I usually just give it to the store employees and hope for the best. Bc I know the owners will come back to the store looking for their lost belongings tracking back their steps. I always do it too for the same reason I would want my belongings returned. Probably not the cash 💵 bc I don’t carry any lol 😂
Seems like a nice kid. Something about him, can’t quite put my finger on it 😂
Bro literally can buy a car now
W J.I THE PRINCE OF NEW YORK
Amen,  never let anything block your BLESSINGS.  I'M OVERWHELMED THIS YOUNG MAN HAS TOUCHED MY HEART. YOU JUST DON'T SEE THIS ANYMORE FROM YOUNG PEOPLE.  HE LET US KNOW THERE IS HOPE. BLESS HIS MOM.  GOD CONTINUE TO WATCH OVER HIM ALL THE DAYS OF HIS LIFE. IN JESUS NAME AMEN.

That’s so nice!
Definition of: “Do not judge a book by its cover…” I applaud this kid!
good for this yo7ng man 👏🏿
This may sound crazy . It just blows my mind that it’s so shocking to the world & people , that this is what was done. Just shows the world we live in ……. I know people would steal it or take the money and run . I understand that ……. But the part that blows my mind like this is normal to me , acts of kindness ….. treat others the way you want to be treated - I guess having basic empathy of would you want your purse returned ? Yes.   Everyone praises and rewards this behavior which is great - just sad to see that this is rare or somehow like a major thing to return someone else’s purse that you find …….. idk
gta tribute
Malone martez?
Now that's a story I love to hear. There is way too much evil in this world and this young man proved there's still soo much good!
I want more. People like him in the world
I wish everyone was like this. You Will FOREVER BE BLESSED 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Amen, Good job you man. God Bless You Sweetie! 🙏🙏
❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🏾
It’s funny how if you saw this kid out in the street with his clothes and sagging pants and the negative stereotype they have of young Hispanics in this country being “gangster” you’d think he was a delinquent but in reality this kid is one of the realist and most honest men in this country. DONT JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER. Sigue haciendo el bien por ti y tus vecinos mi hermanito, te veo llegando muy lejos va en la vida. Muchas bendiciones
I hope he stays that pure forever! His smile when he rang the doorbell was genuine he was proud of himself 🙏
Stop saying we needs more people like him. Why not we need to be like him.
Honesty is the best policy
Beautiful story! I was at a fair recently and I was thirsty and a bottle of water costed 1 dollar. I asked if they had change for a 20. They said yes and they accidentally gave me 39 dollars in change and it was part of a church selling water. I asked myself whats the right thing to do? And what goes around comes around and I believe God was telling me to give that 20 dollar bill back that they mistakenly gave me. I gave the 20 dollar bill back because I didn't want karma biting me in the back some day lol.  The people thanked me for doing the right thing and it made me feel good doing the right thing 🙂
That’s right little homie
Wow bravo for this young man! He deserves every dime of that reward! 🙏🏼👍🏼👏🏼 if only there were more parents like his mother out there nowadays being involved in kids’ upbringing, there would be more young adults like him… you don’t see stories like this much on the news either🤯👍🏼
3k? Another video said 10k.
Shiddd if I saw how fine she was, I’d happily return that purse too. LOL
He returned it bc he saw she was cute
This made me happy
that I was experienced in Denmark, someone stole my wallet and there was a Man found mine and tried to contact me through Facebook (searched name from my ID card). He returned my wallet to my address .
He wanted a milf😂
That's rare youth right there.
Hell nah, my dude was tryna clap them cheeks, one time for the one time
That kid have a good heart
That is SO BEAUTIFUL! Helping to raise my nephew to be this type of young man! My heart 💜 💜 💜 is truly touched!
This is ONE in a million kid ! His mother taught him well!  Finally, a good story with a good reward for a righteous kid!  Bless his heart ❤️!
you know that drivers license photo was bussin
What a wonderful young man! Fantastic!!
His mother should be so proud that he  listened, remembered, and enforces good behavior, in regards to having integrity. Good job.
fumbled the bag
His GoFundMe is at $13,000 😳.. Pays to do the right thing.
Bro thought he was gon smash she prolly looked badd asf in that driver’s license pic
bro wanted to rob the bag the legal way
Mission Completed +Respect $3000
It’s all about how you got raised
fun fact rn its at 10k
Integrity! 💯
Me watching this after I haven't returned my aunts lost purse with just 10 dollars inside and packet of Maynard sweets
I usually skip this part
wow what a gentleman !!
MashaAllah ❤️
0:18 bro... I thought that was azzyland
🌧️🌧️🌧️🌧️🌧️🌧️🌧️🌧️🌧️🌧️
Every time I've returned a lost wallet with money the owner has never gave me a reward.
His good teenager God bless  him.
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽 Yesir love to see my Hispanics/Latinos doing the right thing !!
Instead of doin all those stuff guns and gangster things which is not cool btw.  Learn something from this dude 🔥
Good job young man.
hes so fine
Is anybody going to talk About her lips
Lucky him
Proud daughter of Mexican parents right here 🙋‍♀️ “haz el bien sin mirar a quién” I was raised this way too 👏
Definitely not a trump supporter. A trump supporter would have taken the money out of the purse and sent it to Donald Trump for his "legal fees"... 🌑
I found a woman's ID and everything wallet and everything driving license and everything but I got in contact and gave it back to her
young man's got a good heart that's how you raise your children
GREAT PARENTING GOOD ON YOU YOUNG MAN 👍
Plot twist he’s her son and they just finessed 3k  xD
I think I'm in love with Eliana... 😍
In California? Impossible!
So to conclude:  Step 1: Find a purse Step 2: Return it Step 3: Money  *Starts roaming parking lots for shopping carts*
It happens all the time. The problem is that media needs tragedies
Faith in humanity restored a little bit 🤣
🥰
1:36  go pung ming
But was he Vaccinated though?
thats my last name
plot twist: He's the one that took it.. but decided to returned it for the reward..
I gave Mr. Rodriguez a good heart when I created him.
The lost art of doing the right thing. This gives me hope that it's making a comeback.
He is my age how nice of him
We need more ppl like him
Bro gonna get a lot of female companions off this
Don't just fvcking say that we need more people like him! Try to be like him first! If you can't,then shut your damn beaks.
I work at this restaurant as a waiter, it’s a family business but we do well enough. A homeless man came in and asked to use the restroom. When he got out we gave him some chips and salsa to eat, he was asking for food. I felt bad when he left. Like 10 min later he came back and asked if he could eat there and we said of course lmao. He was hesitant cause he thought we were gonna charge him, I told him “ don’t worry we’re paying for it. He was a really nice man. Gave him a big ass burrito for the road too
This act of kindness touched my heart. Thank you young man, for doing the right thing.
God bless this young man 🙏🙏🙏 God bless you for getting $ to give this young man a reward 🥰🥰🥰
thats so sweet😭😭 he fine asl
I love this story so much! ❤️😢😢🥰
anybody know the older womens social media I’m asking for a friend 😂
im just shocked how someone could leave a whole purse 😭😭😭
What a great young man
Never judge a book by its cover they say, this kid was raised the right way.
Yeah there’s hope
U she wouldn't have paid you would it still be worth it. I think this is fake.
Good guy chad
great
please let this catch on!!!!!!!!!!
He saw the I.D and was like damn ima clap these cheeks 😂🙏🏽
Way to go kid respect
He definitely got more than cash 🤣🤣
Damn this crazy
Plot twist:  that’s her son… they made all this up to try going viral:  plot twist again:  He heard of the Go Fund Me.. that he never got a penny from… return to the house, stole the purse, put it back in the 🛒 in the same parking lot..  oh & he pooped 💩 in it..
Wow
Everyone says there should be more people like him but no one says we should be like him 😃
🙏🏽🙏🏽❤️
Great mother great kids definitely  👍 I am a mom I am sure how proud his mom is God bless this young man 👨 🙏 ❤️ 🙌
Kudos to this young man. 👍🏾
Wonderful man
plot twist: he was the one who stole it 😭
Good for him! Kudos to his mom for raising a good man.
Wonderful young man. His parents should be very proud
I want to know the Reaction of the boy, is there a video of it?
I hope many will do this and I salute this boy for being honest 🤟
Need more Parents like his, Great Job MOM and DAD
Good deeds=good carma
Everyone is not a thief. This young man is the 1 percent who us righteous
He was raised right
There's hope four our future. We need more kids like this young man.
Nah my guy saw her picture in the DL and wanted to have a night of his life.
This just prove value of humanity is increasing and inflationn in good deeds is unbearable. Less good people just means more value for em to be around.
esay was honest and respectful wow
I'm proud of you dude
I’m sure when he went home and told his mom about all this she said you see kindness pays off ☺️
Made me tear up-congratulations young man for not only your good character but primarily for actually demonstrating the wisdom your Grandmother shared with you. I hope your kindness will be rewarded by being recognized by MANY MANY people! Bless you!
Just wait until their credit card statements arrive.
That's very nice of him, didnt take anything out from the purse, went looking to find her and give her the purse, he's one in a millón, god add a special blessing on his life. 🙏💖✌
Integrity is the key to life…..
Who cares!
Funny in Korea this is common.. people leave stuff all the inside cafe's and library's and in the US it makes the news LOL
Dude looks sketch, prob tryna get it in
I’m proud of him for doing the right thing! Makes you think twice before you judge someone based off appearance.
Good on dood 🙌
What a cool kid. His mother obviously put good qualities in her son. She and anyone else watching this should be very proud of him and it should encourage other parents to instill those good qualities in their kids.
Bravo to his parent(s) ... this young man definitely has a sense of morals 👏 there is hope for the youth today
I always say do the right thing, you’ll be your rewarded in a different way. I’m glad it’s never in me to steal. Kudos to what he did! 🫶🏾
Blessings to this kid and his mother for their integrity and blessings to the receiver of the purse and her family for  their show of gratitude.
I mean damn but I know he happy af 😂..Gud job my boi..made that lady day
Don't judge a book by it's cover
Amen. It does speak 🗣 loud words to the kids today and there is hope
There's not to many people like him in this world!
He saw the I'd and wanted to smash 🤣 Good on him tho!
This was a little over the top.. don’t ya think
Didn’t he get 10k?
Love it!!  Great job young man
Aw sweet boy 😭😭😭 Don’t ever change!
Awesome job young man and great job to the parents who raised him right. 🎉❤️  I’ve found three wallets in the past 9 years. First two I was able to return them immediately to their doors as the ids were brand new with current their address. The second I managed to find the gentleman through Facebook who turned out to be an army veteran.
Mexican s stick together 🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙
Amazing job Adrian.
👍
Warms my heart
The only time something like that paid off🤣🤣woulda got some sloppy Topp to🤣🤣
Let’s change and be like him 👍
So proud of this young man!! We all need to be like him!!!
This a rare good job my guy
Super rare action for this teen. I always know good hearted people still around.
But 3k?? Nahhh
I love him
Good job boy
She became > sugar mama
He wanted to hit, my boy lol
He said  My mom ALWAYS told me to do the right thing😭
Love this. Good job young lad 🫡💯
he’s so fine
they report the good deed but did not link the gofund me  lol  Inside edition doing what benefiting them only
I hope this lesson sticks with him the rest of his life, and can inspire other people that good deeds don’t always go unnoticed 🤍 he’s a great kid and will do great things in life!
His mom taught his right, I’m proud of him.
Great story and good job young man🏆❤️🏆
That is called "integrity" and "class" you either have it or you're a liberal, commie, socialist democrat!
Proud of you, Adrian!!!!!
Homie ain’t slick 😂 g wanted to hit that the fast way
why does this get on the news???
Great job mama!! for raising a respectful honest young man !!❤
Apart from the money reward he got  I bet his mum was very proud of her boy and she should also get a mention for teaching him the right way   :)
Even the smallest ripple of a good deed can cause a chain reaction of kindness
Always do the right thing even when no 9nes watching because you know what ? God's watching. And he sees it all. Such an inspiring young man.
I'VE WATCH ALREADY
Yo!  hoping for some leg, but got 3k,not terrible...
This young man made his mamma proud.
🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽💕
"Good hispanic" man.
Sweet kid
Just an all around stand up brotha. Keep it all the way that way 🙏
Whats messed up is he gets $3000 donated in a few hours or days and a 40 year old criminal who has spent their entire life living a life of pety crime, drugs, robbin innocent people at gun point to get their fix and loses their life because of their OWN actions and they raise millions in a few hours or days. While a 5 year old boy is shot in the head point blank by their adult neighbor who had dinner with them the night before, and again they get no news coverage and no support to help bury their son while a entire family of hateful people who has hardly contributed to society and been in the dope game and pety crime game their entire lives get tens of millions of dollars.
Bless his heart so Amazing
He's a hero ♥️
I lost my purse today, my driver licence, bank card, student card, l pray that its returned to me to. Well done young man, your mamma did a good job. ♡
That’s what’s up!
He got more then money
What an amazing, kind young man!! I hope life continues to bring him nothing but positivity, good vibes, and always surrounded by love!  Great Job Mama, for raising a fine young man!!
A good lad
okay but hes fineee
Lost
He stole the purse 👜 then pretend to return it.
$13,015 as of today
I wood Have done the same thing
I remember finding a purse with over 1k in it but I returned it to the lady because I would want the same for my mother.
A sweet and honest young man.  A great deed done by a great young man!  His mom did an amazing job raising him!
IT IS IMPORTANT TO SPREAD THIS TYPE OF GOOD DEED N GOOD REWARD, JUST AS MUCH AS THE CRIMINAL ACTS OF TEENAGERS. IT WILL ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO THE RIGHT THING N EVEN IF THEY DON'T GET AN AWARD, THEY WILL STILL FEEL GOOD ABOUT THEMSELVES WHICH IS AN AWARD WITHIN ITSELF
He just wanted to hit after seeing her picture on the drivers license
Much respect young man.
3k nah i want a night w her friend shiii
He deserves it!
I do this every day.. didn't get 3k for it.. hahahaha
He saw the ID, thought shawty was fine and get a good dream come true reward ;))))
Good for him. Showing us there's hope for humanity and the younger generation!
The lady that lost the purse should have used some of that money to take English classes.
If I had it you wouldn’t see me giving it back😤
Whats up with the aunt 😋
Plot twist: he brought it back because he already cleaned out all of the cash
Easy way to get laid
Never judge a book by it’s a cover
Bless his heart, theres hope for these kids!
God bless him
i would've taken everything and sold the ID information.
The fact a simple gesture like this is on the news shows our world is screwed, this should b the norm, but ain’t gonna lie we wouldn’t of returned it lol.
Amazing.
What an amazing young man.  I wish him the best! 👍
Careless.
Good to see bro doing what’s right rather than just take what’s valuable like anyone else would, brings me hope that the generation that consumed tide pods and whatnot still has people who will hopefully bring change to this world 🙏
I would of hollered ....they some fine cougars 😍🔥
He seen her ID picture and was like 👀… and pulled up to see mama lol
That's right, if you want your kids to do good and the right thing, show them, they do learn. Great job Adrian 👏 👍 👌
Fallout 3 be like good karma
Im the 10000 comment
There is absolutely no hope stoll ok playin. This life is what u make it
Update: it’s now over $13,000!
Thats a darn good kid!! These days, he is probably 1 in 1000....
it would be awesome if this going viral resulted in him getting 'thooooousands'.
His fit goes crazy
That’s so nice
Yessir 🏁🏁🏁
I’ve returned a purse before with my dad after finding it on the street, it was good for me to experience at a young age
bruh saw how fine he was when he seen the id in the purse and was on a mission
I love this 💯
AWESOME SAUCE!!!💯
I just want to thank you for this video because I've been watching a few videos lately and I got kind of depressed yet this one makes me feel good so thank you
I did the same thing and I got accused of stealing
Maybe he can use the money to purchase a belt lol
in my case, it's not always solely because of his parents' upbringing (many parents teach good to their kids but they dont turn out like what they expect) but also because of how the child's soul is moved to return what he sees and doesn't belong to him. Our salute to that child is on an exclusive level
That’s dope asf
That young man was raised properly. “Do what’s right even when no one is watching “.
This story I like the most in social media thank you
2 men came to my grandpas house, where i was living. They found my wallet. I was like 19.  They kept asking if i had cash. And i said no but wouldn't give me my wallet when i reached for it. They finally said they would come back when I had cash. I followed them onto the porch as they were walking to their truck.  I said ok, its ok, i will just get your liscense plate number and have the cops get it back for me then. The guy ran back and gave me my wallet.
another don't judge the book by it's cover moment... kudos chad lad
The world isn't changed by your opinion - - it's changed by your example
Very familiar scenario
I’m sure a lot of people would automatically judge him for how he’s dressed and his race/ethnicity thinking someone like him would never do a good deed like this. I’m glad this is being broadcasted for the world to see.
Hell yea
That's wassup
His mom raised a good man. Kudos to his mom! Awesome attitude, young man!
Awesome video!
Legend
No lie, he fits right into the Mexican gangster stereotype,, yet he did this awesome deed and was raised with morals.
Good story need more
Oh that’s really nice of him
His mom taught him Integrity 🙏🏼
I lost my wallet once, some guy got ahold of me about it saying that he found it in a parking lot and wanted to give it back. The only thing wrong was that $900 was missing from it.
He's amazing!
That's awesome!
Character is defined by one's actions, and this teen's actions speaks volumes about his character.
His mother raised him right
Good man raised by a Good 👍 Mom 👩 👏 👍
His parents raised him right
I once found a ripped package that was dumped by a thief. Apparently thief didn't like what was inside and simply dumped it. I looked up the address and decided to return it to the owner. They were a bit surprised but ultimately happy to get it back. I felt like a delivery man for a moment 😂
What a sweet boy
They need to start another gofundme and make this kids future very bright! Even though I know he has a bright future ahead of himself! Much respect young one MUCH RESPECT! 👏👏👏
Right On 🔥 Seriously !
My mother and I did this before! Someone left their bank card and ID at a drive through virtual atm, so we took it to the lady’s address on her license which was only about 20 mins away. She didn’t even notice she lost it, she and her family were so sweet and very grateful!
Crazy how that bare minimum is on the news lol says a lot abt society…
Love it! His mom raised him right! 👏🏾
Smart investment , purse prob had like 300 bucks and gained 10x profit
With his attitude I'm sure he'll continue to do well (and good) the rest of his life.
I would have taken the money and ran up the cards, and returned it to the store because I'm sure she wanted her ID
God bless him, keep being kind young man.
Beautiful!   Melted my heart.
he’s fine asl
Nice and Kind actions pay back is one of the most beautiful things happen in the world.
There is hope for us. I’ll be it very little but still, thanks my dude for doing what was correct. Hats off to you sir.
Right on!!! Young Man
1st time hearing this
God bless us all
This is awesome
Not Everybody in this world is not bad God blessed us
Thats a good Samaritan in the world we need.. a rare sight
in the world we need people like him to be sincere that kind of people is gonna change the world👍💯✌️
Awesome I did the same thing a couple weeks ago as a door dasher and returned a man's wallet I found in the street. Full or money took nothing and was told by him he dropped it and please step off his property he is running a business out of his house and needs parking space for customers. Different worlds
Can we always do this? Normalize giving some type of reward for returns items! I've seen people give back wallets with hundreds of dollars and not even get a dollar. We should all give good to get good.
That's nice but cholo got like 600 to 700 stacks  around his neck he don't need a go fund me for that lol smh
An Uber driver once returned my wallet.   I wanted to give him some cash as gratitud but he didn’t accept it..
b o t o x
Awesome guy good job mom still great people on this earth ❤️
Homie just wanted to hit it
I returned a purse in savana heights and they gave me like 28 dollars.I returned another purse and got a big thank you. and you know what? they both were in shopping carts lol im not kidding.
This is awesome ❤
I sure hope some company worth their salt has reached out to this young man about his bright future with them.
To the people who all thought he would steal it because of the way he dresses😑
Yassss
I once found a phone and long story short I kept it hostage till the promise of a reward was kept
Great character young man…God bless you…you brought honor and dignity for your family to many others through your actions
You know whether na e thief am😹
That woman was so excited 😂
somebody give that young man a college scholarship.
He is an example for other young kids 👍
Greta
Same thing but in train staion i found a wallet. Inside was credit card driver license many cards  gave back to PSO  officers but no nothing gratitude or any response. Hats off to those families for rewarding that young fella..
Hes fine as helll omgg
A young man with a good heart love to see it ❤️🙏
I checked it right now he’s at 13k 😲😲

What a kind young man❤ and he is cute too😍
Amazing young man
I did the same thing and did not get anything.  I track the lady down on Facebook and sent her a message and we met in a safe spot. I returned her wallet purse thing-of-jig and ain't get nothing but thanks. So you know what it will be next time. 👹
That teen will be a CEO one day. 😊
“Go’ong f’ong me” is the best online fundraising platform 👍🏼
This just reassured me that there is hope for humanity
Good man.
Hay que felicitar a los papas de este chico por la excelente educacion que le han dado, todavia hay gente honesta, que bueno.
I like that girl in the back
1:04 thats how my mom raised me
Not much hope. And he prob stole it and then returned it.
good thing he is not arrested if the owner is karen ✌️
👍🙏👌✊@ u bro
Melina looks like azzy land..
We all know what he was getting into🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣Id a done the same thing i see that ID
Yeah yeah 🙄
Wow this is just beautiful. Be the cambio in your own community 💪🏻
I found a license and a school ID on the ground at the drive-thru ATM. I went to the address to return it and at first, they had looks on their faces like "who is this dude". When I held up the IDs, the eyebrows raised and smiles came out.  People don't trust and usually suspect ill intentions when a stranger comes to the door. Wasnt as neat as returning a purse or wallet filled with valuables, but it was still lost items that were really needing to be returned.  Hopefully one day if I've lost something and it can be traced back to me, the person who finds it will do the right thing.
Later we find out he’s related to them and they split the cash.
3k $ reward??   Robbers from down the street: 👀
He earn respect because he gave the purse back to lady in stead of "stealing it" 3K for a  reward
Def saw her picture and was like ya I gotta get this back to her 😂
Homie is “street smart” he saw a suburban address and new what was up 😏 les falta colmillo raza
If I saw a purse in the street I just wouldn’t touch it Thas just me these cops would charge my ass with robbery
😉😉💞💕
God bless you amen
He was hoping to clap some cheeks and got paid instead, decent.
Blessings to him.
Amazing
i would’ve YOLOd that $3k on stocks 💪🏿
Good bless he a good man
That was a good boy god bless
That is so sweet
He's black, he probably cleaned the pocket book
Don’t judge a book by its cover 🙏
Thee definition of integrity!!!!!!!
We should all be rewarding/praising good behavior in the world, especially these days. Selfishness/greed and hate seem to be on the rise and we need to put a stop to it.
That’s a good man right there
Good job my man....🤠🤙🏼
Plot Twist: He gets a wife from the whole Go Fund Me situation
God bless him
Great Job young man. Need more like you to follow  in your footsteps.
Good job buddy
This kid was raised very well, educated, not greedy, honest and kind man. Keep it up the good attitude and make your parents proud of you. If i'm her mom I would praise him coz he did well and he makes me proud of him.
I'm a believer of nature and nurture. The best parents can end up with a rotten child, and the worst parents can end up with a great child. He commented on his good nurturing, but he also has good nature :)
Why does this not have more thumbs up
Many blessing
A black person would never
Mans saw her license pic and thought he was gonna get some cheeks for returning it .
3000k is a little overkill tho
VERY NICE!
God bless him
Good job young man. My mom taught me to do the same. Now, if it was a bag of money…nope. Well done Kidd.
Base on the way he look u know hes a kid that is trying to be or is cool and now u see those ppl have harts aswell and we need those humans
Nice to see an uplifting positive story with the way it feels the world is now
I have found a elderly's man's wallet with only $40 in it and drove it to his home and didn't want anything but a Thank You. I also found where a business owner in my town put their whole bag of bank money accidently on his hood of his car and drove off and I found it on side of the road and Return it. He tried to give me money. I OF COURSE Refused. I told him all I ask is if I ever lose my pursh God lets a Good person find it & I walk out of the police station. I have ALWAYS taught my kids If you find a wallet, pursh, bank bag etc to return it. God will Bless You.
I want his Instagram or something
people being good humans get paid $3000?
Dude was raised right..
Interesting, this is normal occurrence in Japan. But in the US, it becomes news…  duh.
Proud 👏
I am 30 years older than Adrian...but he is very high class and I would marry him.
plot twist he actually stole it and made the whole situation like he didn't steal it so he can get more money 😏😏😏
Buen samaritano el gang
Respect to my vato💯
If they we’re white he would’ve kept it
Few Good Gems Remains in this Chaotic World. Good Job.. 🫰
Have a great day God love y’all
hes raised right and cute :)
That's how all children should be raised. Not be hoodlums and murderers.
Good Job bro from CHRIS DUKEZ!
Yeh because  I would have kept it 4 real
Good kid
Don't judge a book by its cover.
BEAUTIFUL
that's what good parenting does! this dude is awesome and so is his mom! God bless you both!
That's a real man. God bless brother
Last two months, I found a wallet and return it, And last month, I found another and return it. this ain't a surprise, He's just lucky
Parents paint the picture raise em proper and you should see more of this result
Good boy. Rewarded for good behavior.
Wonderful young man!!!!
I hope my son would do the same thing.
Now that's a story!
just shows u can be gangster and nice at the same time
He saw the drivers license and thought “shi maybe she can get this good samaritan pipe”🤣
Such a good man right here!
"The kindness you put out into the world always finds a way to come back to you" -Dhar Mann
Notice they don't say any cash was in the purse. He was lucky and he got the double reward.
Wow a 17 year old returned a purse that isn't his to someone, that's crazy. Let's make it go viral on every single news channel now, saying that there's "hope for the next generations".
GOOD JOB YOUNG MAN!🤗
Damn this dude is amazing🙏🏾
that fool was clean
My momma says life is like a box of chocolate                        - Forest Gump
How nice of him
Very 👍
Good one Adrian
Someone raised him well. 👏
💙💙💙💙💙💙
Perfect example of do not judge a book by its cover      But i always judge a book by its cover lol when im trying to find a good manga to read hahaha
How high do you think I have to go to expose Toxic Chain of Command like Cpt Gucherio and 1Sgt Kevin Armstrong Retired SGM commander of CVMA gang in Clarksville TN last I know. Got SSG Timothy Griffith from Waycross GA 🔥 PSG for beating SPC Brandon Clark when Griffith thought no one was looking but I was behind my shroud in my sleeping area and Brandon had his room above mine. I was an eye witness and all squad leaders was on Vacation Leave left SSG Timothy Griffith open to bypass the squad leader to the Platoon Leader 1stLT Daniel Mitchell without skipping chain of command. By the book. So how do I exposed Cpt. Gucherio and 1sgt Kevin Armstrong for setup fake night cache hunt mission I called setup...SSG Ramos my Squad Leader gave me a Tactical Trunk Monkey patch for that particular mission that ATE 💥 the other American M-67 hand grenade. Wondering what it said on his purple heart award friendly fire or enemy? Lol⚖️👁️🖖🏻✨♣️🎯🛸🔮😇🧬🧭📯
😍🙏🏽
Finally! A positive story for once that also restores my faith in humanity.
He just saw the picture on the license and was hoping to get some ass
He returned it cause no money inside bag..lol lmao
You wouldn't believe how good it makes you feel to do a good deed like this. And if you get a bonus it feels like winning the lottery even if it's small!
Damn I bet they gave him something else😏
He was, what he wants everyone to be, even if he thought no one else would ever know.. That's being a person if good character..
Bruh
He saw the ID seen she was bad and shot his shot
3k ? But the go fund me is past 10k
auuuuuuuuuuuuugggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Thank u young King  u give us hope and we all appreciate it

Nice
Leading by example, unlike some of our elected officials who won't help their constituents.
Plot twist he stole it*
Awesome 👏
That's what up what a good person 💕 nice a kid on top on that
It’s good to see things like this! 😊
Good man he gives hope to the world there’s still good one out there from uk
Dude can now buy a really nice *Belt!*
GOD bless🙏🏾❤️
Snatched it out the cart and then gave it back haha such a classic ! Kids gonna be a nightmare later in life 😅
Respect to the young man from Ireland
I did the same 7 years ago in Toronto. They didn’t even say thanks. Lady said “OK”.  how we don’t get more of this realistic stories more viral.
thank you young man!
But how did this kid knows where she lives anyway?
Plot twist: He actually stole the purse when they weren’t looking, saw it had nothing of any value besides IDs, then decided to avoid trouble and bad karma by “returning” the purse 😱
That Birkin was worth 20k
i return a bag last week and received a lot of thank you. It feels so good when someone appreciates you
It shows how his mother raised him it shows his best character ❤️👌wow to mom and the boy
And it says a lot about his mom 🥰
*He appears to be very rough and a typical teenager, but then again this is the reason why we should never judge people 👏👏👏*
💯💯💯
💞💞💞

She better than Nelly

Wow….that was amazing young man….godbless you🙏

Never judge a book by its cover 💯💯
I try once to help someone lost there phone and called the girlfriend that was list on guy phone contacts the guy and he know where I work he want past eveyday on the lynk bus but he never stop by my job and had been two weeks holding the phone I Findlay told him come get your phone or I'll smash it  two days later I throw it in the fryer at work and watch it cook then he came by. Next day I was like sorry buddy it's gone some people either use you or it's not a worry to them
This video just gave me a little hope for our future god bless him
Foos gone wild!!
I’m glad the kid did the right thing… don’t get me wrong… but does anyone else find it sad that the bar is set so low that all you have to do is not take someone else’s stuff and we celebrate it?
Mind control game 😉
This foo is hero
I respect this young man, this is why it's not always good to judge a book by the cover..  I hope they hit 4k for him
Atta boy 👍 3000 unlocked  Achievement Unlocked And didn't even film himself doing it for views and attention on social media Extra 20 points
That's a blessing
✨💖✨
What is the boy’s Instagram?
He is getting all the girls in school
That’s sweet: his reply, “my mom always told me to do the right thing even when no one is watching”
Who gives a 17 year old 3,000 lol ridiculous
Good job young man!!!
I'd want to to go give that back to that smoke show too 🤣
Good kid!!! He will go far!!!
3k for the bare minimum
aint nobody gonna talk ab how fine this man is too?😭🤞
This is the way
This 🥺❤️ like THIS😩❤️❤️
Integrity ❤️
You know society is going downhill when you get put on the news for being a good person
You know when his parents saw this they felt a sense of pride because they know they did a good job.
the women had a surprise for him....hehe
plot twist: he stole the purse first then returned it to the owner  ,so he could get a reward and not accuse of a crime lol😂  just kidding lol😂😂 no hate
♥️ GOD'S always watching ♥️
What a sweetheart. Mom raised him right.
Wow  he s good repect to her that ur purse. Image what he did his job …. Wonderful him to god say blessed 😇 🤟🏼
His parents must have so much pride in him.  YES❗️for San Diego🏖 its nothing like LA or SF😊 There is hope for the younger generation👍🏼👏🏾
"Do the right thing even if no one is watching" beautiful way to live he has a good mother.
I hope he gets all that money 💰, his mum raised a good one!!
This is awesome.
This vdo passes absolute relief senation😇😇
She lucky i didnt find it i woulda taken everything valuable and throw the rest in the garbage finders keepers losers weepers my daddy taught me that

L
What a great young man. Beautiful story ❤️
That’s so heartwarming
Inside should have posted the fundraiser link!
Respect.
There’s a proud mom out there that did well
Lmao he just seen that shawty looked sexy so he wanted some booty.
There is still hope 🇺🇸🙏🏻🇺🇸
Shout out to his mom!
He wasn’t recording trying to get likes or nothing
Wonderful point, if he lost something he would want someone to do the right thing for him.
That is so sweet. What a guy.
Wow when I'm a good Samaritan it's expected cause of my job but when this kid does it he gets 3k. Lol jk good job due
Great young man!
this is a good thing, but its also sad to see how glorifying it is to do the right thing, it doesnt happen enough anymore.
Love this story.
God bless you man
Great job young man!
Great kid!!
awee that is amazing 🥺💕
The gofundme is at 10k bruh
MAY ALMIGHTY GOD CONTINUE TO BLESS HIM. THATS WAS A GOOD DEED
May the universe reward him a million times over.🙏
My big sis once dropped i think it was one of those thing where u usually have your cards or money when going shopping outside my grandpa's house and a woman found it and found mu big sis phone number on one of her cards so she got it back thank to that woman
Yeah they all in on it and gonna spilt the funds 3 ways. How come everyone looks to gofundme for help. Reward him yourself
Yea❤️❤️❤️

I lost my wallet in a gas station parking lot - 2 young men found a phone # of an Uncle and called him. Within 10min my wallet was returned. I gave them all the cash 💸 in my wallet; unfortunately it wasn't much(and they refused it many times - told them they earned it fully. Humanity still has hope.
So cool
That’s a good man. I hope nothing but the best for him. Good is good.
Now I never did anything like that, but I did chase after an old woman in Walgreens once she had left her prescription on the counter and walked away without it. So I ran after her and returned it to her.. I got a " Oh thank you sweetheart and she patted my head.
It is so good to come across this especially with so much loss and sadness that has overwhelmed our country. One good deed at a time will make all the difference anywhere and anytime. Shout out to the ladies for rewarding the young man🎉
I'm so proud of this 17 year old he's truly what we need to see in the media is story's like this.
Adrienne💞!!!🙏🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🌎🌏🌍
Perfect example of "not judging a book by its cover". Lol He looks like the "type" who'd be stealing, but he flipped the script. ✔️ 💯
Hfjfjfufugugugututututtrurug

Kudos to this young man. May God continue to bless you always!! ❤️
I'm not crying 😢 lol
Keep doing the right thing bro. People like you, make the world a better place.  100% respect to you, my man!!!
Woah, good on him! 👍🏼
Good job Adrian! Honestly I would have just returned it to the store. I don’t think I would have dared to open a purse that wasn’t mine and then still spend time driving to the house.
Hope for our younger generation? Yeah no, Gen z is the worst.
Foo is a hero
Integrity means doing what's right, even when no one else is watching.  Bravo young man!
Guranteed if it was some fat dude he woulda kept the money lol
Never judge a book by it's cover.
This mom is probably not shocked her child did this. My son would’ve done the same thing. One day my son took me to the doctor and parked in the parking garage. The valet parked a car near him and dropped his money bag with cash and car keys inside. My son walked from the 3rd floor roof and went to the valet station and returned it. The young man was happy because he would’ve been in trouble for that, but his coworker looked at my son as if he stole it instead. That offended me and hurt my son. I told him to not be discouraged by his reaction and never regret doing the right thing. I’m so glad this lady didn’t respond to him like that, the negativity can make people feel like why do the right thing if you get responses of suspicion in return.
is the Aunt single?!?!?
Doing the right thing, even when no one is watching. That's what you call integrity. Nothing but respect to that young man.
the account is up to 10K. Good for him.
We all know the real reason he brought the purse is cuz he saw that license and that latina milf's pic
bro was tryna spit some game when he saw the ID, I don’t blame you young man.
He was definitely tryna get some 😂😂😂
Yes you’re right there is hope for the 2000s generation
he looks like a meme person.
Integrity: Doing the right thing even when nobody is watching. Credit to that amazing kid.
I dont understand the purpose of the go fund me? I feel like it was up to the lady to give him a reward, not the public since it was her purse. But kudos to the kid for doing the right thing!
And he fine too🤭👀
So fake...
That’s what I’m saying ladies.  Sometimes you gotta give credit where it is due.  Mom should be proud of the values she raised her son with.
His fits kinda fire
What’s nice about this is some people might stereotype that young man because of his baggy clothes and tattoos but never judge a book it’s cover boomers!!!
Maybe it's not about the purse. Maybe it's about the friends we made along the way.
Bruh black headed chick is sexyyy
Proves never judge a book by its cover. I'd think he's a partier or hoodlum with the hat and chains but turns out he's a good kid raised right. Cops judged me as a dope smoker cause I dress hippie yet I've never smoked or done drugs. I just love the era, the music, the clothes, what they stood for.
Great story, God bless him
Well done Adrian and respect to his mother for bringing him up to do the right thing.
White people discover honesty 🤣
Good on you brother and thank you to family for being kind w him :) God bless that boys mom and their families and all of them and yall
And he’s fine too
Good job to his parents and for him always taking their advice you just never know what your act of kindness can get you
K bueno k aun existen buenas personas
Well deserved Adrian!!! I'm proud of you 👏 💛
Thanks for posting a positive story
How many 17 year olds would do such a thing? Incredible. What a wonderful young man. ❤.
What a whr
her aunt prob didn't even bother to say 'thank you' lol
👍
His mom raised him right.
пацан красавчик конечно держится на своих принципах  крч уважение от меня
This young man was raised well!
Cause I wrote down all your credit cards already 😈
He better save it and invest into container homes and rent it.
Doing the right thing when no one’s watching! I always stress that to my adult employees, amazing!
A California teen
Never judge a book by its cover ! This guy definitely looks like a gangsta but apparently he is a good samaritan !😂
"Why didn't you reward him?"  I didn't know?   Unbelievable.   I'm glad he got a BIG reward but I woulda hit him with $50 to a $100 on the spot what ever I had on me, even if I had to drive to the ATM right then and there.
Very generous family
Very profound how he said to do the right thing even when no one is looking and God answered him by amplifying his good deed to the rest of the world. He didn't know there was a camera at the doorstep nor did he know that this would make headlines and everyone involved would tell the world about it.
So sweet, good kid. I'm so happy to see that. ❤🙏
Bad ass!!!  For all of them!!!!  Thank you JESUS!!!
Proof that he doesn't do TikTok.
The younger generation DESPERATELY needs more like this young man
MAMA U DID GREAT WITH UR BOY
And it’s crazy cause just the way he’s dressed and he’s LATINO anyone ignorant would have labeled him as a thug or a troubling teen, goes to show things aren’t what they SEEM
His mom taught him to have something that’s very rare these days…. INTEGRITY, it’s finer than pure gold
if i got $3000 for every time i returned someone’s purse or wallet to them, i’d have $12,000
He's so fine😩
Wow! I didn’t know people still do that.
We need more people like this
💫💫💫💫
Very cholo of him
what an awesome story. returning my faith in humanity
Wow there’s still some good ppl in the world 😊
Bless this boy's mother!!! She did a really good job raising a fine young man. 👏  good job Mama! This is exactly how mom raised me.
*Plot Twist* He turned into swiper and instant transmissioned out of there and brought it back😎
There is hope for the younger generation and maybe this world won’t turn into Idiocracy, like the movie. Haha seriously though, this young man has a good heart.
The lady speaking, Damalina, has a lump in her neck. Hope it's nothing...
Plot twist he stole it and had no money in the purse so he returned it
What they say don't judge a book by its cover prime example good person just look bad thank God he's not that was cool of him
His mother raised a Real Man with good Morals. Respect G
This young man's truly blessed to have such a strong role model mother. And it seems he will continue that trend being a strong role model for others.
Yes, GIVE THIS CHILD AN AWARD! Unfortunately for me when I do good deeds very rarely do good deeds be returned to me. I would turn in lost phones, money, items etc. But when I lose stuff that can easily be turned in to lost and found or whatever, I never get it back 😞
Im impressed
An Edgar did a good thing? Wowow
Good young man. Great example for his peers.
being rewarded for not committing a crime
This is very heart warming to see
Man, I love these type of stories. This young man is going far in life
Maybe he is broke doesn’t study and jobless but he is indeed a good samaritan .
Not only did he not take the purse he drove to the address. Most people would of just turned it into the store what a good kid!
He saw she was hot and...
What a wonderful act of kindness. This young man erased a terrible stereotype associated with his age group and race in one instant. He will go on to achieve great things in life. God bless him.
Never judge a book
So awesome. ❤️ and I'm happy he got a reward!
He could have just given it to the store lmao.
Good j0b buddy
Good man. I'm glad someone is raising their children right still. He's a good person and I wish good things for him through his entire life.
I love this story.
A good deed goes a long way ✌️👍
He seen her ID and was like dang!! She fine!!!! That's why he did it. But still nice of him. Need more people like this.
Congratulations Adrian!
Good job you young man. Keep up the great work I'm truly proud of you
There’s still good in the world. 💕💕
Praise GOD for that young brother!
This happened to me in Malta 🇲🇹 and the guys from Muddy Waters bar , where at my hotel the next day with my bag and all my money in there 🙏❤️🇲🇹❤️🙏
What a good guy ❤️
God Bless You Kiddo!
That’s awesome good carma
Damn, he's really cute.
He deserved every penny of that reward. He’s a sweet, beautiful young man. May God continue to bless him.
That Royal Godly and Godly parents  too
Rare story, because most kids or people wouldn't of have returned it? Good for him, and others like him. Definitely a great story, Thanks for sharing. 👍👍👍
First  learn English  before  going on media
So ya'all must be a good parents to ur kids
🙏🏽
I found a woman's debit card in a parking lot one day, I looked her up on Facebook, she was a manager at a Krystals and I returned it to her, she was very grateful.
A real life hero.
My name is eliana to
Good man
post about real problems. this is boring!
Protect this man at all costs
I bet he took all of the money out of it first
He didn't do a great thing, he just did what was right like his mother taught him. It's a bit sad that this is something special in America. Kind of says something about the majority there.
Def shoulda tried to bag either of the friends if he saw um😭
There is hope for our future, yet!! What an awesome young man. Great job, Mom!!👏🏾❤
His parents raised him right and he listened
A world were not stealing is seen as a rarity to be rewarded
He seen that id and was going for the dinner date lol
Atta boy.  Look at that sometimes it pays off to be honest
I would do exactly the same thing.
man from the good hood!
He is a Blessing❤️🙏
I had my lost wallet mailed to me once! Blew my mind! I have done the the favor a couple times now my children have also seen me do it. So I hope they will do it as well.
He probably just wanted to hook up with the owner of the purse n took a different turn
MURICA!! THATS how WE ROLL.
My AirPods loved this.
I don't know why I read he received $17k. $3k is still great though.
God bless that beautiful young man!!
One time when I was 13 I found a wallet that had about 400-500$ in it, we lived in apartments so I took the wallet to the main office to fill me the owner and didn’t take a single penny, eventually the lady who owned it shows up, didn’t even say thank you, and we weren’t doing too good on money too so I could’ve  easily took it, but never again am I doing that.
Definitely raised right.
Boys like know better unlike blk men
You definitely would not find many people doing this today.... An i only say that cuz there's such a huge drug problem out there an her purse could have fallen into the wrong hands..... Hats off to this young man an his parents for bringing him up so well.
my boi seen the baddie on the driver’s license n said i gotta pull up with a good boy act on that
Now.. let's open an account  for the mom as well..!!
a man would end up being  responsible no matter what if his parent will teach him to be like that.
proof my generation isnt all bad.
Love this
Listen and learn parents!!!
.
Plot twist: he stole the purse and returned it in hopes of getting a reward
Good Samaritan still exist ❤️❤️❤️ good job for you man, keep up the good work 👍👍👍
Love our San Diego teens  Great to see a positive story !
That mom raised a fine young man. Good job! 👍
Their no money in the purse that y he returns it back .
That's refreshing
Fake news (there’s a lot of that on here)
Need more young people like him. He definitely was raised up right!!!
Wow seems pretty unheard off these days but glad the young lad got blessed for his good deed 👏🙏🏻👍
Legendary foo
Amen 🙏 GOD IS GOOD!
Hell yeah dude good foryou
Obviously this guy did a good deed. However, it's a shame that something as simple as doing the right thing by returning a purse you found has become such a rarity now days. This should just be something that people do always.
What a good guy!! ♥️♥️♥️🥲
He returned it because there was useless things in the purse like gum, lip gloss, condoms, M&Ms and eyeliner.  He knew he'd probably be getting a reward.
Guy looks the total opposite of somebody who would do such a good thing like that. Never judge a book by its cover
That’s why you never judge a book by its cover, some might think he’s stealing it, when in reality he is just doing the right thing. Or any one in general doing something like this.
His mom should be extremely proud of her son. Such a kind gesture from a young gentleman. Bless all involved in this story. May we all follow I'm his steps and share kindness to all.
He’s an angel 😇
How much gold was in that purse for this 3k i didn't understand?!?????????????????????????????????!??!??!??!¡¡!!!!!!!!¡!!!!??????????!!!!??!!?!!?!!??!!
That's for all the greedy out there. You get more blessings that way regardless.
Bro...homeboy has a thing for milf's and thought he might get lucky.
You see some teens doing the "knock out challenge", other teens committing smash n grabs, other teens showing little respect to their parents, ........and once in a blue moon you see teens like this.
We need more people like him.
3k reward that really never happened after you return anything foreal but that’s a blessing foreal💯💯
God Bless him
I love this so hard!!!!
I want to take this boy out on a date. I am his age. He deserves the fricking world.
I found a wallet full of money and a drivers license in it on a car park, handed it back to the boy that lost it, not even a thankyou, just the obligatory grunt you get these days
Awesome!
Character, he gonna do something great in life. The Politicians we deserve, proven gud character, not the fake ass politicians we get.🙏😎
The irony; the video opens with the lady saying (to the effect of) "there's hope for our younger generations".  But yet,...the lady who received the purse doesn't even have the gumption to throw the kid (example) *GAS MONEY* for taking his time/effort to return the purse, _AND_ ,...doesn't even bother to get his info so, perhaps,...the rightful owner could give him a reward....!??!?  If that ain't *IRONY* , I don't know what is!!?!!?
Such a happy ending💚
👏👏👏👏👏👏
Yes a nice lad but I can’t help to think of the Movie “Greta”. Look it up if you don’t know.
It is always NICE to read beautiful comments from some people who would not evem act like that young boy....
When she heard what happened, she was shocked, flabbergasted, even passed out on the floor she couldn't believe someone had ever forgotten something before, insanity.
Homie saw the ID pic of the fine ass lady and immediately drove over 😂
Shouts out to that young man 👏
Hes fine too SUCH A BONUS

bless him
In a world of full of wickedness, there’s still some good people with good hearts. God please watch over and continue to bless this kid and his family.
Wonderful young man who put himself in another person's shoes. I'm so happy that he is part of the future.peace 👏👏👏💟
never ever judge a book by its cover!
That’s awesome God Bless
Honesty such a grace.
How beautiful is he and a credit to his mother who taught him to be a gentleman...God bless him and his entire family...🎈😎
Lmao lets judge a whole generation by 1 persons actions. Inside edition... you need to look outside the box BUD
my dog went crazy when the doorbell went off
character is what u do when no one is looking
Bravo, Young Man and to the ones that rewarded him!❣️
Great job young sir!
Very nice,need to make these stories national. Not just the bad ones.
ngl i think he was into the girl whos picture is on the driver lisence and somehow she knew
I once gave a lost wallet back to its owner and the owner just said “I’m going to sue you if anything is missing” without thanking me, like what?
Thank you Lord, Thank you Adrian's Mom, and, Thank you Adrian.
hes the sort of person people would think wouldnt return it
I think we all know what he was really looking for
1:24 can someone help me understand what she's saying here?
Congratulations to this incredibly young man a well-deserved reward for an amazing deed.
That’s awesome. His “look” clearly isn’t something we should judge ppl for but yet many still do. I have to admit I am impressed because he’s managed to squash that stereotype single handily
The guy look so handsome
Anyone want to leave their purse somewhere I’ll bring it back to you leave your id in the bag
There’s hope for the younger generation? Really? Lol pretty sure that’s what adults said about her generation when she was younger. That’s a condescending thing to say about a kid who helped you.
Kid is gonna go places
A law abiding foo
There really is good people . I work at major healthy insurance company and had someone call in who found a persons wallet and didn’t know how to get in touch with the person who lost it because they were at work and couldn’t drop it off to them at their address. So the man called us his insurance company in hopes of us calling them member to let them know where they could pick it up . He gave his name and phone number for them to call him . It was awesome to witness that there really is good people still out there .
His mom raised him right.
I do stuff like this also. Found a phone down town not too long ago and was able to get it back to the owners. It had no passcode on it so anyone could have wiped it and stole it but I wanted them to have it back. I didn’t get a reward for but wasn’t looking for one. Just wanted to get their phone back.
What an amazing young man 👏🏼
how bout don’t lose a purse ?😭
Your mom should be super proud of you young man.
Good man right there, always take care of the ladies!
Thus kid , yeah boi
That kid is obviously NOT  a trump supporter because he has a brain and he's considerate of others
The mere fact that he went all the way to their home just to give back the purse speaks volumes.
Man…I did this in high school and got suspended. My school said they had to make an example of me for going through a student things, even tho nothing was taken and I had ppl (including my teacher) watch to be sure.
Good kid..... even better mom for teaching him!
The new gen might be soft, but they’re some of the nicest and coolest dudes
Nice!
Just when I’ve lost complete hope, stories like this and how everyone came together to reward the Burger King employee who got shafted, help restore my faith.
So proud of this boy. I feel like a proud parent even though he is not even my son.
Good kid.
We need more young men like this.  Great job young man.
Thanks girls. A beautiful deed for the young man. God bless the two of you.
After watching countless doorbell cam footage of porch pirates swiping packages and people just stealing random things off other people's property, this is refreshing. Good job, kid!
Yea, needed this. Kinda restored my faith in humanity a bit. Thank you for doing the right thing sir. Your mom taught you well.
His parents raise him well unlike other parents don't cared about their kids so sad 😢 this boy is a true wise and amazing.
Treat others how you want to be treated!
Good vibration
Your an extremely good man the world needs people like you. God bless you
I’ve returned peoples items to them countless times to them because I know how it feels to lose things. Needless to say I’ve never gotten $4000 for it😂
dont judge a book by it’s cover
Lol you guys really think 🤔 he did it out off 🤣 kindness lmfao he saw the ID PICTURE AND WAS LIKE DAM SHES A HOTTIE. LET ME GO SEE HER IN PERSON AND MAYBE SCORE
Her mom must be so proud of him  she raised him so well❤️
If there were more people like him in this world, it would be a better place to be!
He isn't a BLM  member!  That's the difference!
99.999% of good deeds don’t go unpunished.
Wow looking at the kid I never would have thought…..never judge a book by its cover… God bless you kid…. And whats up with the Botox by the woman’s friend she cant even smile properly…🥹
There is hope for our young .❤️
He is good looking😳❤️
I watch this full video, this young man is such Good person and respectful to give woman's lost purse in grocery..  It really happened to me, I almost lost my favorite bag and the man give it to me and I say thank you to him.
I had left my purse on the back of a food court chair in the mall, about an hour after shopping realized, went back to the chair… wasn’t there. Went to mall security, lost and found, some random person mall security went too… all hadn’t seen my purse. Went home and the next day got a call from my work saying someone brought my purse into them! I had my wallet as a wristlet so that’s how I was able to shop and stuff because it wasn’t left in the purse thankfully but my work name tag was in the purse! Anyway nothing was missing and I’m glad I got it back. Good for this boy for going out of his way!
THE TEENAGER LOOKED LIKE HE DIDN’T NEED WHAT’S INSIDE THE PURSE. THE DUDE IS DRIVING AN AUDI. OF COURSE HE WOULD RETURN IT. THE $3K MIGHT BE LOOSE CHANGE FOR THE TEEN.
🙌😊
I 100% guarantee there was no cash in the purse that’s the only reason he returned it🤣🤣
Gas money!
there was no money in the purse so thats why he brought it back
Love it
Juicey smollet in reverse.
Must been real drunk to loose her purse !
This use to just be what people did in Southern America anyway. Kinda sad that this is now unusual. You lose more than you steal with ill-gotten gains. Nice to know this kid  gets it.
Kudos kid !!! Keep it up
Adrian is a good kid
Wonderful Story!!
He just wanted to meet the pretty girl in the picture I'd 🤣🤣😂
Bro looks like a thief himself 👩🏻‍🦲
It's good to see people getting reward for their good work. 😎
He wanted to do the right thing but this could have went south real quick if someone saw him take the purse and called the police or got stopped by the police on his way to deliver it back to the owner.  What version of the facts do you think the police would believe?  He was returning a lost purse or he stole it.  I saw a story last week were a guy unarmed someone at a party and held them.  When the police arrived, they shot him because he was holding the gun.  Sad that you really have to think things out before you do the right thing.😒
I woulda took the money and dark hairs numbers
Yeses now this was Beautiful💖💖💕💕💓💓💖made him feel great cause I definitely feel great when I do ah good deed💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💃💃💃💃💃😉😉😉
💖
makes you feel good to see this
It’s sad that this generation don’t understand the concept of these kind of deeds why because we as parents have lost the importance of teaching this to our Kids it’s Beautiful to see these old school ways that this Mother has taught her Son
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Im so happy for all of them and now he can buy a belt! Win win!
Being young like that, and taking the time out to even return it, is pretty amazing in itself! Not to mention the honesty...good job!
Thank goodness for strong morals, he did the right thing expecting nothing and look at the universe rewarding him!! Good on him!!
Oh so he’s fine fine
❤️❤️❤️
Lord protect this man and his family. We need more of this!!!!
W mans
Buen ejemplo para Los jovenes.
What a great kid, kindness and doing what's right always gets rewarded, but that's a nice little chunk of change he earned himself.
He return it for the purposes of getting a reward and a min of fame. Plus.. their was no money in the purse
Glad to see there is still some good folks out there.  🤙🤙
What a awesome guy we need more people like him in this world we really do.
Most people I know would return the purse...especially if there wasn't money in it (which I'm sure was the case)
They’re both bad as hell I know bro hit fr fr 💯
Another angel on earth 🌎😇😇
That is absolutely wonderful! 👍 I hope that that story is an inspiration for others to do good! 😎
This is an all around great story. With all the chaos and hatred in society these days its nice seeing stories like this. Shout out to that you man and shout out to the women for rewarding him. I hope more people see this and small acts of kindness like this continues.
Good kids like this seldom make the news, but one rotten apple is all over the screens. Thank you young man for restoring hope to this beleaguered world.
Handsome young man too. I'm so glad he got rewarded for doing the right thing
Great to see!!!
Always  do the right thing. God is always watching.
Bless him
That's why we should never judge, he has the heart of an angel
Elaina lookin fire
God bless your mom boy🙏
In our times this is national news . I've done this many times you don't see me anywhere . Good for him though
If I returned a wallet ID get slapped for not returning it soon
The world needs to know such stories more than when a 17 year old shoots a whole class of pupils...
Dang,  I've done this plenty of times and still haven't went viral.  Ugh
Good man
I KNOW he was nervous af turning that purse in
True hero
How about we become like him, instead of needing more people like him
He saw the address and knew they were loaded 🤣
Naaaaa he was tryna holla seeing her id 😆😆😆😍
Lots of people would have done this
Mom taught his son well. Mom should be dam proud！
If you ever lost your purse or wallet you would understand
I raised my son's the same way more parents should do the same !
His mom raised him very well
Good job kid!
Mom taught him well 🙏🏻❤️
👏🏼👏🏼
"my mom always told me to do the right thing even when nobody's looking" 😍🙏❤️
Mom raised a good son.

Men in tattoo n chains is not all bad 👍

Bless this amazing young man 🧡 and his mom for raising such a high ethics person to influence a whole generation... heartwarming 💚💚
He is a moral compass for the young kids out there! Doing the right things doesn’t go unnoticed! Restoring a bit of faith back into humanity 🙏 blessings to that young boy hope he has a good life
Shoulda let him clap as his reward
Imagine if they actually wanted to reward him with threesome, but he refused and wanted money instead 🤣.
❤️ Great man, lead by this example! 💛
Can we still contribute?
Such a cool dude
Dang the next time I see a purse that ain’t mine imma do the same thing.         I want 3k too
👏👏👏...Thank You Mr Adrian...
THE GOOD LESSON IS IF U FIND SOMETHING RETURN IT AND GOD WILL KEEP YOUR STUFF  I LOST LAST WEEK MY IPHONE 13 PRO MAX IN AMSTERDAM  FINALLY I FOUND IT BACK .
Very good parenting. Bless you more youngblood.
That’s awesome 👏🏾
Imagine how proud his mother is right now.
Great kid and a great mother.
Good old momma
Kid was raised right. There's still hope for the youth.
i would take a kiss & their number as payment anyday from those beautiful women haha
Good work all round 👍
Shoutin  Out from Detroit Mi, So proud of this young  Man “this shows a lot about his character, respect for others things, and how unselfish he was to have gave a-little  of his time to do something from the heart -  you don’t see this everyday- we need so much more of this example going around for the world to see it doesn’t take much to do a lot of good- Bless you! & his mother “Go Mom” hats go off to you as well-
I returned a lost purse one time with cash  inside, credit card,medications...when I returned the purse the lady cried so happy...that was great what he did
Crazy rich Americans
Haha they didn't want to reward him themselves and had to resort to a crowd funding page
nah he was trying to smash lolololol
This gta?
Great integrity! His Mom taught him well❤️🙏🏽🥰 He deserves all the money raised. Now you will enter your SENIOR year off with a good start. God bless you young man 😊
When he turns 18 they should uh.... Give him somthing else....
👍🙏❤️
thanks sir
that's so awesome, probably made waaaaaay more than he would've taking it and now he knows his parents were right, more stories like this please
His parents would be proud of him👍🙏🙏
I watched this video last night and literally same scenario happened to me. Found someone’s wallet
I returned a purse and got my ass jumped
He’s cute
Now that’s gangster 💯
Respect dude 👍
We thank his mother ❤️💯
I returned a Wallet with $600 bucks back last year and got $20 cash
That’s a new louis vuitton… god bless this young man!
She a baddie, he saw her pic on her id and was like yeah imma return this 🤣🤣he not slick
I hate to say it but we're living in an era where it's getting harder and harder to trust young people! That's why this story truly touches my heart. Good job young man!! 👏🏿 👍🏿😊🤑
I almost guarantee the real reason he returned it was becasue he took one look at the id photo and thought he might get some.
I usually skip this part
Great story. This guy is great from Mississippi
I love this! This reminds me of my a show I’m watching rn called my name is earl on Hulu  and the guy tries fixing all his mistakes he did  before and gets good karma around. What you give you get around remember that!
One more year and he can be rewarded even more 😅😮‍💨
Awe!
Unfortunately, fake kindness begets fake gratitude. Do what is right without any expectations whatsoever. Only then will it be a true act of kindness worthy of praise...
Maybe he is a good kid and maybe he isn't. Because here is one thing criminals do. If they find a purse or a wallet they will check the purse for money or mens wallets and they will check people's ID's for their home address and write it down to remember it later, and then they will return the purse or wallet and maybe get a reward. Then they will return at a later date and rob the people blind.
Respect to that young man!
Don’t judge a book by his cover 👏🏻
Do the right thing even when no one is watching..... we all just need to tell our kids that. Maybe one day the world will be alright.
Glad he got a good amount of reward.
I remember finding a phone, I called the telco to tell her to come pick it up.  The owner came to get the phone, not sure if she asked or I told her, I said "it might have something in there that you could never get back etc".  She was happy and also cried.
He most definitely gon receive his blessings 🙌
Ok, it was good but they shouldn’t have set up a go fund me, he did it for himself out of generosity not for the money. People need to set up a go fund me for the right thing
Restoring faith on humanity
Smart boy
Nice
Momma taught him to have character. Nice to see…
Of course good kids still exist, in every generation, however it is so endearing to see. Amazing, being the change you want to see, treating others how you would like to be treated, just good stuff all round.
Don't mind me I'm just passing........👜👍🐌
He’s so cute 😭
That or he looked at that woman's ID and was like damn she fine as hell... Maybe if I return this I'll get a special reward. Lol
I'm in love with this guy. We need many more people like him. This is awesome. 💙💚❤💜🧡💛💖
Amazing story and what a great lad. He should be very proud of him self
Plot twist. He stole it and brought it back and got the reward 😆😏 jk.
Pero si caben o no
Porque tanta propaganda yo y mi esposo hemos encontrado villeteras y celulares y los regremos
His Mother raise him Well he will Be Blessed By God 🙏🙏🙏
Good for him
what kinda cheapskate still uses gofundme to raise funds for a reward of this nature lol
I found a 100 on the ground one day found out a woman had dropped it so I gave it to her and never even got a thank you
We need more people like him he's a good kid
All good deeds have a reward 🙏🏾
hopefully the world doesn't corrupt him
Tripped out for a bit wondering why they wanted to "fine the young man" instead of "find" him 🤣🤣
Cool boy.
Nice young man
The main thing to also look at is never judge a book by its cover. A lot of people would see him and quick to thing he’s a “thug”
What a wonderful sorry God Blessed this round man truly..❤️❤️❤️❤️💯👼👑
I wanna be like that kid 😃
It all comes down to good parenting.  Also teach your kids:  Never do or say anything to strangers while you're with your friends that you wouldn't have the guts to do or say if you were by yourself.
He seen how she looks like from her ID so that’s why he did this lol
Good guy! But it's sad that normal behaviour gets so much attention and praising. Like it's a miracle. It shouldn't be.
Inside edition
Well.. He became a man.
That's lovely, good old fashioned Christian/wester principles at play.
I found an empty  (except for some coins) wallet with scattered documents on the ground at a bus stop. It belonged to a teenager living next district from me. Next day I went to his place, ringed but nobody was home, so I put the wallet inside the mail box (luckily it was outside). People did this for me in the past,just did the right thing.
He’s a beautiful young man raised by a beautiful mother! Not outward beauty, their inner beauty is what is shining✨May god bless him and his family 🙏
That crown daisy smells like a wet diaper when you rinse it! Gh’aaah! So’ew! I touch it with my bare hands when I prep it. I’ll wear gloves from now on. It smells like a good reason to try smelling butts… and maybe tasting? Eu’ugh.
you murdered her you rape her kill her children  -oberyn martin 👀
Imagine, he came across from where he was just to return the lost bag. Wow! Amazing! 👏👏👏
What a lovely young man . Well done mom , you raised a good man.
Lol no offense but 3k go fund me, is kinda crazy
Nah buddy thought she was fine and thought he was gonna get some for being a gentleman 😂
Its all about good parenting.. respect to the guy and his mom's good parenting.
Woww
Lmao he was trying bust a move tf you mean
Türkiye'de milyoner amk
he fineeee😍😍😩
He chose wrong reward👀 should get that martin instead
Yes, give him a great gift, of his honesty. By bringing the purse to there house. His a great to be followed.
Good people r rare, it used 2 be normal now rare.
Plot twist- he stole it and return it
Wouldn't even be a story if he was white
Just goes to show that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. I love stories like this. ❤️
That woman on camera has a thyroid goiter. Hope she checks with her Dr!
What a wonderful young Man. God Bless him and the people who wanted to show through a gift how much he was appreciated.
staged? no idea but ive seen the same guy somewhere else  Casually returning another lost stuff if i remember correct.
This is sweet and all. But ever tried being nice and everyone hate you?
He probably  stoled it and gave it back
Now he can buy a belt.
May Allah bless him and others.  One message foundation channel
Good going! He made his momma proud!
Nice! 😎👍
Good for him!
That is a great story. God Bless
Nice job!
Hope indeed, the power of a single good person speaks volumes.
I hope he inspires more people to do the same. Good soul
The way he was holding her purse🥰
That's a good kid! The world needs more like him. God bless you kid! 😄
I know this is supposed to be normal, big deal, what people ought to be doing,but... ...still, goosebumps. Adrian Rodriguez, don't change, wouldn't mind you being the future president. "Do the right thing", agreed!! :) Respects to your mom.
This is so sweet!! I really hope more people can be like this kid, and the world could learn more about treating others better. We all need good people in this world
Nah he looks like a cholo can’t trust someone who dresses like a gangster only trust people who dress rich
he fine
when a 17 year old thug looking kid does things nicer than people in suits and ties.
2 years ago I found a lady's wallet in a shopping cart with 400 cash in it. I drove the wallet to her house and she barely gave me a thank you before she slammed the door in my face. To this day I wish I had kept the cash and left the wallet. Next time.
found almost 300$ on a bathroom floor last month, told the front desk if anyone came in saying they lost money to give them my number. it was a difficult choice because im currently homeless, but turns out the woman who lost it was keeping it for someone else and she kindly thanked me and gave me 20$. i just hope what goes around comes around 😭
God bless this young man 🙏
Awesome! 😊💖
Theres no hope for our young generation💀
That’s awesome! Looks like mama raised him right.
What a great young man.
That is a wonderful young man!! Girls … that is what you look for in friends . Honesty and kindness. You cannot buy that. His mom and dad taught him well. The reward will be repaid in different forms throughout his life. Great job! So refreshing to hear and to see!!! All the best to you Adrian!
Good to see & hear some good news for once.
This is a good kid and this is what a man looks like
Good man
That’s why you never judge a book by its cover
This went good but it can go either way. I found 800 dollars when I worked at Walmart. I turned it in to customer service and and someone took 200$ from it and they accused me of that.
That's right bro!!!
Bro just saw a bad b1tch on the id and thought he could get some
To anyone watching this if you’d kindly return my orange dooney and passport card and books that were stolen out of my suv that would be awesome. You can keep my kids shots records and the other vital records I went through hell replacing. 😒
Glad to see he got payed 👏🏻
This is what i needed to see in this desperate time
There’s hope for the country! Thank you young man!
It looks like a goddamn Birkin
Good God... I guess I'm the voice of sanity... I returned three credit cards and a driver's license I found in a parking lot and got a very grateful thank you... It was enough. Rewarding kindness is going to backfire..  People will start demanding it...
Loves it
he’s fine af
idont think thats the reason of him giving back maybe because she hot😎😏😏😏😏
"there's hope for our younger generation" i mean there is alot nice ppl outside of the TV what you see on the news 😂
I am so happy to see these kind actions in our younglings. 😍
I swear, Ring has the easiest job ever. They don’t even need to market for themselves. That company prints money
How could anyone dislike this????
His humanity and gentlemanly approach stood out. Congrats young man on giving us this reminder.
Good lad.
Good for this kid
I'm gonna hire someone to steal a purse and I'll be the knight in shining armor returning it to get 3k next day 🤭😏
Aw this is a nice story. His parents did a great job and good for him for actually listening to what his parents taught him.
Lol that time he looks like a gangsta. Judging a book by its cover...
A good Man. A Great Mom, to teach him right. A well deserved reward.
& 3 Million Views.
Looked at the drivers licence and said yup milf..
WE DEFINITELY NEED MORE PEOPLE LIKE HIM IN THIS F***ED UP WORLD
Thats how i met your mother.
That was great what a sweet baby for bringing it back he did the right thing I'm so proud of him!
A clear example of INTERGRITY. Your mum did a BRILLIANT job teaching you that.
Makes me feel good, I returned wallets before as a kid and I know how grateful the people were
👍😊
Good kid
and if it has been a black kid?
Big up to homie to doing th right thing !
💜👏🏻
And he gets a job every twice a week
I have returned wallets so many times, even returned it to someone in Canada
This kid took a huge risk. Some racist person might have came out and shot him. It’s great that that didn’t happen but I would have gone to the police and gave it to them.
I know things like this happen...but one time when I was in management at Wendy's a woman left a purse in the lobby. I found it under the table while cleaning. I brought it into my office and decided to find her ID to call her...in her purse was 50,000 dollars (I know how much it was because the withdraw slip was banded around it)...  I found the ID after seeing that and I knew I had to keep my mouth shut and lock it in the office. I used the ID to find her called her and asked her if she left her purse in our lobby to make sure I found the right person. I told her I used her ID to find her so I could get it back to her as fast as I could...and that I knew I had to keep it locked in the safe.   She came and picked it, didn't say thank you, didn't act like she cared that nothing was missing despite I could have easily gotten somebody who didn't work there to "find the purse" and bounce with it. She acted like it was an inconvenience she had to come back to get it...   I just wanted her to say thank you...screw the tip...just show me you appreciated it... because I've lost my wallet 3 times in my life and none of them were returned, and I had money in there...I've had other lesser things happen where I did good deeds and I was not shown any appreciation for it...so it's caused me to become a bit sour. Like why should I even care anymore?
Awesomeness 👏🏼
I thought that said something else
Hey anybody know his instagram account
Sweet
When he turns 18, give him an experience that he won’t forget.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Excited to know of this wonderful young man & the very nice ladies also 🌎
He probably stole it
This is beautiful, much love.
God bless you young man.😍
he was just tryna spit game after seeing her license 😂
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
When i was a kid we were taught not to except rewards for doing the right thing. It taught us to do the right thing regardless of consequence or reward. This instilled culture and trust.   Unfortunately now young people only do the right thing if there is a reward.
Godspeed for that kid
Godspeed
Good for this young man. Thank his mom and dad for raising him to be a good man!!
Salute to that young fella for just doing what's right in an era where it's rare.
Love it 🥰
he actually recieved over $9,600 from a go fund me started by the lady who owns the purse
His mom did a good job🙏
My dawg boutta cop a O of loud with that go fund me money 😂
Awesome kid.
This is y u should never judge people by appearance! 💪🏿
I’m so happy this young man was rewarded. 😊🙌🏿
Good young man. There is hope for us yet.
Her ant? Like that giant ant in Honey I Shrunk the Kids?
Good deed need to be more appreciated and rewards often.
I've returned someone's wallet before. I worked at a golf course, saw it in a cart I was cleaning, and temporarily stored it in my pocket for safe keeping. I somehow forgot to turn it in to the pro shop before we closed for the day, so I drove roughly twenty miles extra to return the wallet to the address listed on the driver's license. I was rewarded with $20, but what I _really_ cared about was the fact that I no longer had to feel guilty about taking a stranger's wallet home with me, even if it was just an accident. 🤣
U supposed to return it to the store this works too would’ve never got any recognition the other way
They've now raised $10,000
Definitely need more people like this gentleman! Fine work
What an Unbelievably Great guy he is. His two reasons for  bringing back the purse where Huge merits to who his Mum is and what a Beautiful Family that they must be. Love this kid 🥰
Now that is a definition of a true chad
See this is why I love my Cali people. We can be crazy sometimes but then again who isn't? Most of us know respect ✊🏾💓
And he’s right great kid
Hey! : )
Ok someone lose their purse or some belonging, i’ll go return it back 👍🏼
His parents raised him well. This gentleman has manners.
See people, not everyone with a tatto or a cap or always wearing black or something else, they still have a kind heart and we should respect them!❤
Bro tryna pipe
This warmed my heart so much, don’t judge a book by it’s cover
He's cute too
LOBILLOS MUSICAL DE DURANGO.
Where can I find me one of those! 😍🥰
God bless  That boy
What a gentleman there ! 😌 Very kind hearted. So nice to see people like him in the world we need more people like him doing the right thing ! So glad she got her 👛 back !
Aw man they did him dirty
Good on him for doing the right thing God bless his parenting for teaching him
very nice young man, also risky though because u return something to the wrong person they can easily lie and say stuff was removed. worlds crazy
Awesome young man
this is why girls loves badboys

This type of video is a food for the heart 💜  Bless your big heart Young Man!

Awesome young man!
What too much john quinones does to a good samaritan
Plot twist: the purse has no cash and only cards, driver's license and some lip gloss😆😆 jk✌️
We need more Men like him out here. 💯🔥🙏
Good job bro...god bless you and your family
His mother taught him  to do the right thing.
Good job, set good example! Some people seeing this said no way he looks like gangsta, but even then defined in our actions! Good job Rodriguez way to go! 🌎 Not just society but world could take note and learn!
a kind of youth that the world needs, salute bro, keep up the good work.
Wow! What a kid!!!
The real ❤️
He looks like Her kid
He saw her ID, and said “damn, maybe if I return her purse I’ll have a chance with this mami ” I see what you did kid, I ain’t mad at ya.
Giving people back their stuff should be completely normal. In this day and age it’s breaking news.
Good looking women.
.....
A while ago when I was about 18 I found a wallet in a Popeyes restroom I turned it into management after I took the cash. I also found a purse at Target on a shopping cart I looked around just to make sure the owner wasn’t nearby I was concerned that if I grabbed it someone would realize I was going to steal it. Luckily I got away scot free.   I’m joking I turned in the wallet with all the cash and I told a target employee about the purse in shopping cart.
I lost a purse with 3,000.00 cash in it years ago (I was going to buy a lawnmower) . I was so happy that the Walmart employee returned my purse I gave him 1000.00!
Bless Him even more in his life 🙏.
this is the kind of positivity we have to share daily😊
I freaking LOVE this!
Hispanic we teach their kids to be good ppl.❤
Yes very good bless his ❤ alot of this generation would not return anything especially a perse..

Don't judge the book by its cover.

Amazing! He deserves it! 👏
That’s. A gta mission foo needs to be a character in the next one delivery boy
15ish years ago my (now) wife and I found a woman’s wallet in a parking lot. We looked at the Id and drove 30 minutes to her house to give it back to her.   She freaked out and started screaming how she’s already canceled her credit cards and I’m a thief. Some guy who I assume was her husband said he was calling 911.   Trying to tell them what happened wasn’t working at all so we just left. There was a bunch of loose bricks on the ground at the end of their driveway. I didn’t do it but I REALLY wanted to just hurl it through their fcukibg window.   Instead we went to McDonald’s. I wish we had just left that wallet where it was.
More than blessed to see that the gofundme had reached 10,284$ now
True chad.
That's  give me  hope for our next generation  becouse  the old one mess up with greed  and wars  devide conquer    greed  that people  all of  over the world  suffering  till this day hunger  wars geopolitics  every  little  good deed make me happy, good  job young  men.
This is a beautiful thing! God bless this man
Lol yea right
Kudos to his mother.  There's still hope in the youth of today.  Salute to you kiddo
He didn’t expect anything in return but a little pssy
praise our LORD 🩸 thank you for being our savior jesus Christ
I grew up in a rough neighborhood in the south bronx and one day when I was about 11 I was headed up the stairs of my house when this blood gangbanger walked buy and accidentally dropped his wallet. It just so happened to drop at my foot so I accidentally kicked it into the hallway, he didn't notice. His wallet was thick with 100s, could barely close. It must've been like 10K in that wallet. I picked it up and gave it to him. He didn't give me a reward but hey it was the right thing.
Bruh i hope Insurance didnt hear that part about not changing her address LOOOOL, her face was hella sus when they said that lol
There is hope for humanity after all!
💙✨💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
👏👏👏👏👏
San Diego California!!!!
Very nice of him
There’s hope for a younger generation 🤓
Always do the right thing even when no one is watching. Yes we need to educate  our young ones with this motto. Well done!!
🙏🏼 blessings for All in this video.

✨🤸⭐⭐⭐
Respect to this young man......and Melina is smoking hot!!!!
i think it’s funny how some people return something with way more money than they got with turning it in (may not be this case but it’s funny when it happens)
He followed his mum's teaching. 💕
The Rodriguez films really do seem to teach good family values.
Mom raised a good teen
Ay we got the same name 😂😂
Good guy. His mom taught him well.
7 years ago I came across a baby in a dumpster behind a Bartell's drug store in Seattle. Through DNA I was able to find the mother and drove the baby to her apartment in Spokane, WA. She didn't answer the door, but I did leave the baby with the Honduran maintenance man for the building. Can I have $3000?
Good job👍
I have return purses with money and didn’t get nothing!!!
YESSIR
Bruh reminded me of Greta
There's hope for our younger generation 🤓
I know a scam when i see one- 👴🏻
He returned it hoping he'd get a better reward because there wasn't anything of value to him in there to begin with.
Love this story!
This foo just saw that the lady was cute in the id and said ight ima pull up
Much obliged youngin keep your natural good instinct you'll do fine. 🙏🏿🙏🏿
What a great young man!
He literally just returned a purse! That’s like the basic minimum of integrity! 😂 They made a whole ass news story!
I feel like other people would definitely   Judge him on how he dresses. But now they won’t
Fukn-A Adrian!! My dude!! 😎🤙🏼
You reap for what you sow.  You sow good you will reap good, you sow bad you will reap bad.  There is always someone watching and it's God
Mom raise him well!!!!  Proud of this young man, listening to mom. Do the right thing even no one is watching!!! I hope this world can have more good young men like him.
There’s a lot of good still left in this world ❤️
they want him.
bro just wanted to smash, yall
Nice
The fact the the purse owner is a total smokeshow had nothing to do with it I’m sure lol
The mother thought him will...❤️❤️
now this is a guy who's mix tape i will willingly listen to
Better have given him 3k and some head tf.
Since no one said it...the dude is FINE too. Yeah, yeah  i said it.
What a nice guy
He can get whatever he wants 🥰🥰🥰
What an amazing young man. God bless his heart
Definitely needed this today 👼
Nice
I would have settled for a piece of ass🤷‍♂️
always do the good thing
It's also nice to see somebody doing a good deed and not recording themselves so they can upload it to their social media. Good job kid! 💜
Dis teen is good and dat ain't hood!  😶
It also says a lot about his mom.
Guy is a walking G
Mom of dude tough him well good example of America.
When you put out good energy, you get it back!
😊
Good for him and that dear lady was very generous as one should be...simply having to go through all that one does what with,  drivers license,  credit cards etc. HAPPY ENDING! 😊
I wish him a good future
This is wonderful to see! ✨ But I too have honest integrate kids. My son now 26, at the time 15 returned $100 bucks in Costco when he saw that a woman walking ahead of him dropped them without realizing it. I was and forever will be so proud of his honest dead. Once we teach our kids that being honest trustful, integrate and humble. It's guaranteed they won't chose to be otherwise. 🙌🏼❤️
😁
There should be more people like this in the world God bless him I didn't know they were nice people left out here wow
Their is still hope in humanity.
Good job bud
This man survive thanos snap
👀👀
Zammmnnnnn
Right on Adrian..!!  You made San Diego look good..
Lol he was gunna take the money but he saw the picture on the ID and said " I'm finally gunna score, heh."
eminem and snoop making impacts for real from D 2 to the LBC ✨
Good dude !
You only got it back because there wasn't any cash in there. That's how that works.
I got emotional watching this ! What a light in this world 🫶🏼
Finding a wallet is a chance for good l fortune.. just return it.
It's even more beautiful that he is 17 and has such a good heart, because let's face it, most people his age these days?.....Jesus. I'll stop there.
jeez.. the last time I returned a purse all I got was the $5k inside of it
i bet hes gotten absolute zero sollars from that gofundme
Love these stories. Im 30 and live in Indianapolis IN. And I have never lost my wallet before. But about a month ago. I got off work really late and needed to go to Kroger. And I did that. And from being so tired. I was in a rush and left my wallet on the self checkout area. And I have a metal ridge wallet. But sadly I didn't realize l left my wallet for about a hr. So someone could had literally spent thousands. Because I'm not rich ag all. But had 4 credit cards and bank card. So I locked all my cards and had maybe 80 dollars cash in it. Ran back to Kroger and they were already in closed. But the cop that does security was nice to let look real fast. But it was gone. Literally 5 days later my neighbor knocks on my door and days a man was looking for your house he found your wallet and wanted to return it. And my neighbor just said yea I know him and I'll give him his wallet and the man said thanks. It blew me away Literally. My 80 dollars all my cards my gun permit etc was still in it. And I just wish I could have seen the man I even told my neighbor. I wish he would have seen my house and I would have atleast gave him that 80 dollars literally.  Because getting my ID,,gun permit,4 credit cards and my bank card alone would take a good amount of time. And on that 5th day I took work off to get it all done. Yet that morning some man returned my wallet but sadly instead of my neighbor pointing him to my house she took it. And that's not her fault glad she did and she's a good neighbor. But I wanted to reward the man. Especially since I live in the hood and lost my wallet at a hood Kroger. So it shows that we still still do have good honest people in the world. I did post on my Facebook etc and told the story hoping he would see it. But no luck.
I bet there was no money in the purse that's why he brought it back.
His mum.taught him well ♥️
Yo dog you're getting a "that a boy" from me.
God bless him!
Respect to this young man!
yep, then my dad who works as a nurse, SAVING people’s lives, only gets paid 30 an hour.
Good sh&$&. God bless this young man,
Raised right!
Awesome!
🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊Good deed!!!🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊
I love this!!!! I believe in the good in others and the best way to make a difference is to be the good you wish to see in the world. 💜

He got lucky because they just eaten a dead baby fetus they had just aborted. It triggers they're pleasure centers.
What a great kid !
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾HES WORKING JUST STAY STRONG HAVE NO DOUBTS AND NEVER GIVE UP🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Thank you for good news
Eliana ig?👀
Mostly everyone would do this
Beautiful
Obviously the boy is NOT a Republican :-) good good!!
For anyone who is suprised that someone did the right thing....this was common among white communities until they got trashed by mass immigration.
I was about to lose hope on teenagers that looks like him but, when I watched this video I realized that I shouldn't judge a book by it's cover.
Que buen mucho. Yo quiero enviarle dinero también, alguien me puede por favor conectar con el?
Nice.
Very goid
If we can affect our youth to show them that grass is so much more greener on the other side before it’s too late..   That kids got a good future if he stays that way, he’s clearing raised right and has the right mentors
Restoring the faith one act at a time
Cartels wife in San Diego enjoying good life
Fantastic
Good job mom, you raised him right and it stuck. Good job young man 👏
The homie.
20$ get tf out of here
See how a good parenting results. We need a good, solid family environment for a livable human society.  Congrats to the young man and his mom!
I want to donate.. If we get enough people to donate 1, 5, 10 dollars; this could help him with his future education or trade or whatever...
He's got integrity 💯💯💯
He was raised right good guy god bless him keep that good soul and spirit protected young man the devil comes at gods best the hardest
Salute young man 🙌 In this crazy evil world we need many more like him
The fact he went out of his way to the address shows a lot. I am not going to lie, I would have just returned it to the store. Takes a lot to go out of your day to do something nice! 🥰 kudos
accomplished teenager
This speaks volume about the young man! He knows that keeping the purse wouldn’t bring him anything positive, like he said nobody was watching him, but the world still recognized his effort for it, without him even desiring any recognition! He did what was is right, & GOD will do right by his for being so selfless. God bless the young man & may he stay on the narrow yet straight path!
I actually found 1500.00 USD in a Ziploc back inside a brown paper bag stuffed down in a planter outside an apartment complex while resting during a summer move of a client. I had very young subordinates working with me on that move so, I explained to them to always do the right thing even when no one is watching. Afterwards we drove over to the nearby police station and turned the money in. We were told if no one claims the money after 90 days then we could claim the money as found. It kinda became a daily routine in our workplace to inquire about the status of the found money as we counted down the days. I'd even call the PD from time to time to see if the money had been claimed. On the 90th day, my assistant called the PD and was told, "Oh, that money was claimed months ago... sorry." I thought this was a bit odd since I had been calling and was told no claim had been made throughout the entire 90 days. I told my assistant not to tell the rest of the shift and I actually ponied up 1500.00 myself and told her to pretend she went to the PD to get the money. Everyone was so excited. I took "the money" and everyone on shift out to Red Lobster that night. Team building, yay. But I always wondered to this day what actually happened to that 1500.00 USD found in a Ziploc bad stuffed down inside a planter outside an apartment complex.
Good to see great stories like this awesome bloke
Just shows how you can be a good role model regardless of age. Momma taught him well. Awesome dude and I hope the world continues to reward his kindness!
Now that's an amazing young man. God Bless him. ❤😊
Well done Adrian! Keep your heart pure and your head screwed on straight. Blessings to you and Mom who taught you to do the right thing.
Bless his heart.
Good for him.
Dont judge a book by its cover! Lil homie has heart & a good head on his shoulders!
this is such a nice story, those ladies were fantastic for setting that up for him! But I've seen several stories of old white dudes giving out 5 or 20 bucks for returning their dumb self's wallet they left 10 grand in. tbh it's always the right thing to do but if you're poor and suffering...you do what you gotta do booboo and you don't need to call ET or inside edition for it, either lol pro tip: just remember, that found money is spending money. use it on gas, don't be buying cars and ish with undeclared income 😂
That great now he can take that 3 grand and fill his gas tank all the way.
🎉🎊❤❤❤❤
He got way more than u get after helping someone getting their stuff back in GTA 5
See what not  being greedy and doing what's right even when no one is looking gets u
Sorry, but there is no hope....This is one in a hundred, That's why I live in Japan, I have3 been ripped off here, but it was other Americans
He saw the girl on the photo ID and he was like, looks like I just found me a conversation starter 😂😂
He dresses like a person who you would think would steal it tho lol
This use to be normal, not it takes a hero to do it
Impressive....wow
i pray that he does'nt get robbed now that this is national news. he's a great young man.
faith in humanity restored
A lil excessive amount.
Good for him!!!
A mother's goodness lives on within her son's.
"Nobody" was looking physically but God was and repaid the righteous act by the young Man.....
This warms my heart.  Thank you young Man, keep it up and go influence your generation and the next!
Returned it when he found no interest of what was inside.  Possibly empty purse        Just kidding  Everyone goes Caca
Now every dudes gonna do it expecting this to happen 💀💀 like this is a very rare chance to happen
I wanna say thank you to these ladies because it was so nice to reward this kind young man because you’re right most people especially his age would take the money. But he did the right thing and he was rewarded for doing the Angel like thing. Karma really does work people. I also wanna thank this kind young man for giving us all hope and showing me that they really DO still exist. I’ll give two other examples. During Christmas time my sister, Mom and I were at the grocery store and we stopped in the little eatery to have a drink and then we left to finish our shopping. My sister eventually realized she left her purse. It wasn’t there but thankfully someone turned it in and hadn’t touched a thing. Even during Christmas time? She begged them to show her who turned it in. She had all her bill money in there. She was going to give them $100. But they were so busy they didn’t even remember. My sister donated it in their honor. She was so shocked so she posted about it on Facebook and called them her Christmas Angel. I also left my purse on top of my car and thought I would never see it again. Someone returned it to my home the next day. I had no money in it and the lady told me she said I know you had not money but I saw all your cards and your lotion and your makeup and I thought she’s gonna need these things. I did because my food stamp card and my license were in there. I could not afford to replace them. I felt like I won the lottery. I just love these stories don’t you?
I’ll be the guy to say it. He returned it because the woman was attractive. Jk but no really jk but no really.
AAAAWWWWWWWW
To the parents of this teen, GREAT JOB!!! On raising your son.  You did a GREAT JOB AS PARENTS and it shows in your son. You must be so proud. And rightfully so. I'm proud of your son and I don't even know him. He is a GREAT EXAMPLE when parents do their job.
This is so cool. I actually did something similar when I was younger, helping people feels so good.
An excelente example of proper parenting He made his mother proud.
That's nice
Absolutely wonderful bless his ♥ need more people like him in this world ☺ ✨
Rare
Well taught young man he deserves the prize 💝💝💝💝🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍👍👍🤟🤟🤟
in real life, that advice will only reach a little far, but I like it.  Just imagine politicians following this advice from her mom. Hahaha. Impossible t work for them
Love to see people like this! 🙌🏽
Good role model parents !
You see this is what we want in the world good can come
Their needs to be more kids and people like this kid
Love to see it! I bring my kids to the dollar store and make little Tupperware lots of socks..travel toothpaste…sanitizer…cotton swabs…water etc and keep them in the car for when we see people in need…I hope they grow up to be as kind and caring as this kid! Great job Mom!! ❤️
Honesty and integrity should always be rewarded!
Good young man
W mans
"fine young man raised by parents right" uh is that correct grammar?  shouldn't it be "Fine young man raised right by parents" ? i'm no native speaker but it looks wrong
This made me smile
Don't judge a book by it's cover
I always believe that this world is not completely lost with corruptions. There is some good people out there that always do the right thing in this world you just have to find them.... There's lots of people who been corrupting and kill each other, robbed each other, etc but also there's also lots of purity people as well.
I would be so proud to have a son like him
The good ending
🥰
Respect! He deserves the money as a reward 👍
Respect
Good man
That’s a good dude right there!
This guy is a role model.  Also (no offense), people would probably judge him by how he looks (race, clothes, tattoos, etc), and this is why we shouldn't judge a book by its cover.   In summary, we need more people like him. To his mother, thank you for raising this man how you did. He is making a difference wherever he goes.
They decent too shouldved gave em the cakes along with the 3k
Hello, The 17 years old boy did the right thing. I applause for him. Awesome. He gave it to her. God Bless You All 🤟🤟🤟🤟❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👏👏👏👏👏🙏🙏🙏🙏🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈
I'm so proud of this young man! Wonderful job to his parent/s for raising him up the Right way!! I'm so happy he was rewarded for his good deed. This is a lesson for mankind.
I love love love this story God bless him 💖
Glad to see humans still human ❤
I’m sure his mom is so proud of him, she raised a caring , honest young man ❤️
What a heartwarming story. He’s an awesome young man.
This is exactly what we need amid all the craziness in this country.
💙🙏💙🙏💙🙏💙
See this, this is how young girls and boys should be raised. Growing up to be respectable ladies and gents.
We need more young people like this
Good, the kid deserves a reward just for being an exception in today’s world.
I swear to you. I did the same and they called the cops on me.
God bless him he was raised right. Mom must be proud of her son..
As a 17 year old, I look up to people like this!
Lovely kid. I wish him all the best! ❤️💐
I'm glad I get to see this instead of another shooting
My mom lost her phone and we kept calling her number to locate it - eventually a man answered, he was a police officer at the police department- a homeless man had walked miles to hand it in, with the phone ringing the whole time he was walking.
Mom deserves a pat on the back. Good job Mom.
well shii theres not alot like them these days 👀😭
This is why I always give people the benifit of the doubt and never judge on looks or anything. All of us have kindness in us, we just need the opportunity to show it.
That's awesome, good job👍
I found a wallet and turned it in. I didn't get rewarded for my good deed. 😔
Good job kid! Excellent character
Finally there's someone who actually gives hope for Gen Z.
Beautiful story!! I'm happy this was highlighted bc I feel our youth doesn't get alot of light on doing the right thing! May God bless his and all who acknowledged the act. KUDOS TO HIS MOMMA!!!
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽THANK YOU YOUNG MAN 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Plot twist he stole it 😂
0:18 jeez she looks like the guy from the mask films
That MF didn’t have money in it. 😂 That’s why
as Dave Chapelle says,.... " I got some booty! I got some boot-ie!!" hence the look on their faces the whole time 🤔😜✌️
God bless him
What a great kid. Aww
Now I want to see him be interviewed after he get his $3,000. Great story. I hope he really get the money.
There is still hope! Proverbs 22.6
Well, you can definitely say that his mama raised him right!!  So proud of this boy.  Hope he grows up to be an outstanding adult.
Good Job parents well raised your son.
His mother raised him right 🙏🏼
I remember seeing those 2 women on a certain website last year
He's not just been raised well but listen well.  Take no bad influences from peers and social media and do the right from his heart.  Lord blessed.
Kid driving around in an Audi wearing thick chains took the purse there instead of turning it in at the store customer service desk.      Weird stuff going on here.
I love this story.  Props to Inside Edition for sharing this good news to the world.
He was raised well I would be so proud of him if I was his mother I'm proud of him and I don't even know him ❤️
Fake
It’s stuff like this when I realise that there is some hope for humanity
I cant even lie, before I read the title i thought it was gonna be about some robery or shooting bc of how much bad is constantly on the news
Stole the purse then return it back great gotta try this out
That’s so awesome.
He saw her ID and was like dayuuuuuummm
Well I know how to get rich quick. I'll just fake it and collect money to split it between me and my friend who faked it. Repeat and be creative and there you go... That really might be a thing
Props to the man no doubt. The unfortunate thing is our sense of civility and basic human kindness is degraded to the point where this is a story at all. And to the parent(s) and relatives of this man thank you for being part of the solution.
In California no less. There's still hope.
Evicted with newborn 😫 in motel bathroom anything helps $Lattimoresymone 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
cool dude 90 percent would keep em things
Don’t judge a book by its cover !!
Further proof of the importance of raising newer generations right.
And yet racist yts always want to label people of color as "thieves." But this amazing young man is a prime example of people of color doing great things and breaking that stereotype.  We all know if the person who found that lady's purse was yt, he would've stole it.  Again, bravo to Adrian! He deserved every penny for his wonderful deed!
W guy
Beautiful, that's what I would do and I know that's what my son would do. 😀
Good job...
Wonderful. Needed this story today
So very very proud of this young man🥰🥰 Kudos to his parent or parents for raising a thoughtful and caring son....BRAVO👏👏👏👏👏🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤
Hope for the younger generation? Like A grown adult is going to do the right thing. 🙄
Kudos to his parents for raising him well to be a good person. This young man's future wife and kids would be very lucky
News stations: please broadcast this every second that you can! Spread positivity! Humanity needs this
Bless them all ❤
This is great. But I think this takes away from the lesson of doing the right thing because it’s the right thing to do. This video incentivize doing the right thing, which teaches people to do the right thing and expect a reward.
Do the right thing when no one is watching...exactly !  I agree, for I did the same thing many, many years ago when I found a purse at the Berlin Train Station, Berlin, CT. I was able to find the woman's address, and drive to her house to drop it off. Unfortunately, most of the contents of the purse were stolen, however, there were other personal items of value.  Also, I found a wallet in Dunkin Donuts, called the owner from some of the information that was in her wallet, and left it with a DD employee (on video surveillance camera) until the owner came and picked it up !  Honesty pays ! Good for him !  A fantastic example for the younger generation, as the woman in the video had stated !
Fun fact your eating while watching this video
he’s fine asf 🧍🏽‍♀️
I was going to comment his mom raised him right and yup the woman said it before I typed it
Dats a birkin
Damn. That lady ID photo must be good as hell! 😂😜
God is watching!
He’s cute
damn he’s fine ngl
Genuine kid
Lets be honest here. He saw that the purse belonged to a hot girl with big boobs, and figured maybe something good might come from this for him.. if it was an man's wallet he found with cash in it he's keeping that. It's funny how nobody even considers this, you aren't capable of thinking a step ahead.
nice
HE WANTED TO LUCK UP ON SOME 😽😂😂😂
More stories like these ☝🏼
Top 10 heroes.
I was blessed with the same kindness. This was many years ago but I still think of them now and again. I left my wallet in a Food 4 Less shopping cart in the parking lot. I drove home and didn’t even notice. About 20min later a man and his young daughter were knocking on my fence I went out and the man had the little girl hand me my wallet and told me where I had left it. I gave the little girl $20. I will forever be grateful for their act of kindness 💕
imagine a happy ending with two beautiful women like that, dream. do good people
He’s so cute
What a guy. Need more people like him in this world!
What a SET-UP video! PATHETIC! Dear commie leftists; here in the South we teach our children to return property that WON'T be receiving ANY cash reward!!! NO ONE with BRAINS fell for this FAKED Drama!!!
Damn if it was me I'd say screw the reward get the cougar in bed !!!! Hottie
He's also very handsome <3 total package
Lmao, this happens daily in white communities and the media be like "errm, racist? No? Ok then nothing to report."
I'm not even going to tell the story what happened when I did this in target SMH
We dont need people like him            We need to be MORE like him
Umm. Lady fine.. I'd return the purse
Excellent parenting coming to fruition! Strong values?..........✓  Amidst the urchins that abound, a real man develops before our eyes. Bravo!   Congratulations to the two ladies in the gathering of a just reward, and to the community for seeing clearly to it.
God bless you young man!♥️♥️♥️
The world doesn't need more people like him. All of us have to be more like him.
That’s a great story very good news to know. It’s still good people in the world to this Day. God bless that young man and I hope more people be like him not for a reward but be that way for God will reward u 😁🙏🏾
I wish more people were like him. He did the right thing to return the purse.
Eh, They gave him the money of other people. Not their own. The 3k wasn't out of their pocket.
amazing!!
👍
This is what world needs to be this kid is awesome we need more people like him I honestly don’t why I get so attached to kind people but that was awesome that he did that his parents raised him right people need to understand don’t look at the outside what matters is the inside he has a big heart for doing that because most teenagers would of not have done that they would have took what ever is worth inside it and the fact that he managed to go out of his way and bring it back is awesome this kid is inspiring and we need more people like him in the world he deserves the best
Character is doing the right thing when nobody's watching. Kudos to this young man, I'm proud of you  !!!
He saw a pretty lady on the ID picture
the teaching and good example of his righteous mother is to be PRAISED!!! 🙏🙏👏👏👏
One day at work, i was heading to lunch and I look down and there was a wallet.  i pick it up and open it and right away and I saw his license and I knew it was one of my co-workers, a director.  I closed it up and looked for him. About 20 minutes later he walks in and I said, "you dropped your wallet by the Xerox machine".  He looked at me strange, looked and checked to see if his money was still there and it was (about $300) and said thanks and walked away.  The weird look at me made me feel like he thought I pick-pocketed him and then returned his wallet.
I love these kinda stories
Hero
God Bless that young Man, and thank God for His Mother. We need more of both of them. 🇺🇸
Someone: “Why did you return the handbag?”  Me: “Why the hell not?”
The way he held the purse too! Lol he knew it was worth money he handled it with care 🥺🤣
Unfortunately in the eyes of Cops, and White Republicans/conservatives he still looks like a “young thug.” When in reality he’s a good hearted handsome young man.
I gave a Walmart cashier $50 I found on the floor by her register and I didn’t even get a thank you.
Right on man more people need to be like him this world would be a better place
What a good man! When I see articles about teens committing crimes, especially hurting old ppl, it breaks my heart. We need more of this in the world instead. Bless him ❤️‍🔥
What a feel good story. What a great kid.
❤️❤️❤️❤️🥹🥹🥹🥹
God's blessings be always on this young man. Praise God that there still honest young people around.
Good kid raised right
Woman shoots man point blank in Philadelphia, she's on like twelve camera veiws, no can find her. Kid returns purse, one camera, rewarded 3000 dollars. Lol.
👏👏👏 Great job Mom👏👏👏👏great job!
He was raised right
That's so nice of him
Truth be told he saw how fine she was on her license and pulled up hoping to shoot his shot
left my wallet at a payphone near my complex in a not so great area. I was 16 . The next day it was pushed under my front door with $60 still in it. I didn't realize it was even gone ,#1..I was shocked it was returned with the money #2..#3 I was especially glad I found it before my mother came home ,...because God knows it a been either :put it in a slot machine, bet on a horse race,  scratch offs..  before she ever gave me the wallet with the cash 🤷🏾‍♀️
Never reward an act of kindness with money. It's not appropriate for something good that someone does for another out of the goodness of their heart
Obviously in a nice family and has been up right
You kno he got that thang on him. A good heart.
Mama did good. Raised him right. More grown folk could learn from this young man🥰❤️
He got 3k and is boutta use it on gas on the way home
Actions like this happen all the time, they just don't become public like this one. The world is full of humble young men and women, not just liberals burning down cities.
She said she has hope for this generation… as if the last 5 generations of people weren’t possibly suffering from the worst trauma imaginable. If anything we we’re supposed to turn out better than the adults if some adults weren’t lazy parents. Give him his proper credit
Well, atleast there’s still hope for younger generations.
❤❤💖💖💕💕
Love him.  🌟
Great kid
Been there and done that but no $ I just wanted to make sure they got all their stuff back that’s was my reward. Good looking out young blood.
His mom’s raised him well. He is a really cool dude from what I can tell.
chicken
That's her nephew 🙄
He’s cute
Sorry, kid still looks and sounds like a LOSER. Wouldn't trust him with anything.
deffo piped Eliana
Need kids like this all over unfortunately people r not like this kid he deserves a medal from police
He saw that ID and saw a baddie lol we don’t steal from pretty girls lmao
Yeah but because of the way he dresses he probably can't get a decent paying job, society doesn't reward upon merit, most rich people have no morals.
Proud of him for doing the right thing, and happy that God blessed him for it 🙌🏾😊
good job Adrien, we need more people like you.
I think this was just a bit much, i personally wouldnt have donated my own money because some kid pretty much did the minimum. It might just be because im kinda jealous, though.
Oh wow! That’s so kind of him :) bless him!
Speak a lot about his momma♡
Inside Edition please find and report more stories like these.
The Young Man is a Goodfella!
I can be really funny. I just need to talk about my life.
THANK YOU MAAAM???
His mom is the kind of mom I want to be. Keep it up young man! You're changing the world, one good deed at a time.
Hire that kid! He’s got integrity and a work ethic!
God Bless him !
I've returned things like that, but have never been rewarded.  Guess I was my own good karma. LOL!
Wow really i cant judge a person heart by his looks. I raise my glass to you sir!!
This boy will have bright future if someone guide him in the right direction. Hats off to you and your mom , sir.
I returned a purse to a grateful woman, where's my GoFundMe? I swear people get so lucky except me.
Fine lad prime specimen
Good man, will have a good future.
How I wish someone did the same thing to my sister, just last month my sister drop her wallet in a tricycle on her way to school containing more than Php3,000 which is equivalent to 50 US dollars I think, and the money was supposed to be her payment for her tuition fee but unfortunately although my sister and her school reach out to the place where the tricycle regularly park to wait for passengers, the driver didn't show up and the wallet was not returned, and we're also short on money at that time and my sister had to write a promissory note just so she could take her exam.
Now thats gangsta
shi i woulda returned it to her fine ahh
Do good to others and it always comes back.
Foosgonewild
God bless him and his Mom.
It’s a two way street. I’ve literally returned multiple wallets to people and even saved a few pets along the way. Usually just a thanks as they scurry away. They can’t even look you in the eye 🙄 But I’ll keep doing it just in case one day it should happen to me, I’d hope someone would do the same. Just be careful cuz at the same time my husband and I were about to pick up a wallet a woman left on a boat and leave it at the front but she came back and seen us and basically non stopped insulted us for getting caught stealing and even spit at my husband.  It was horrible, we usually give off the appearance of ‘upstanding’ citizens so it wasn’t like judging us would put us into the suspicious scoundrel category. Might I add we hadn’t even touched it, I was just telling my husband we really outta do something or maybe they’ll come back so we’ll just wait til the boat clears. We were the last ones off but this old lady and her friend were so rude.  It never stopped me from helping people in the future. You’d be surprised how many people leave their wallets on the car roofs and run off. At the end, it’s like they never truly appreciate what you’ve done for them… but like I said I’ll keep saving people from theft, card cancellations and what ever else comes with it.
Good mer good
he was properly raised by his parents
If the cops saw him walking down the street with a purse, they would have shot him.
He kinda looks like my cousin 🤭
What a dude
What a good lad. 🙌🏼❤️
Good job indeed God bless you more.
So this is what Ben Simmons has been doing in the off-season?
Didn't know Romeo Beckham is such a good boy
Wow! Just wow! Kuddos to the parents of this kid.  God bless
Repent to Jesus Christ  “just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”” ‭‭Matthew‬ ‭20:28‬ ‭NIV‬
Karma really liked his good deed
Then he went out with his boys that same night and shot someone dead on the highway because they got passed by them.
My boy seen her I’d pic and was like hundreds and fifty’s or big ole tiddys, count the GREEN or get in BETWEEN those toddy’s.😂😂 BIG W
Wish more people was like him.
god bless him and his mother ❤️😌🙌🏻
Why don't they speak Spanish together?
Sad when a act of kindness makes the news because it’s so rare nowadays 🥲
thats whats up this what needs to be promoted
Did he get them digits?
1:41   it's not 3k but almost 4k.
It's sad that this is a news worthy story!  That said, he does have his moral's in the right place.
This is the kind of thing that warms my heart. What an outstanding young gentleman raised right.
Get it because he looks like a thug
I just returned a purse yesterday, a dad left it at the bathroom. I received nothing
Other people steal and get $15 reward 😂😂😂
Down ass foo 💪🏾
That's truly lovely ... And when I heard that his mom taught him to always do the right thing even when no one's watching ...well that's called integrity ...and her son has it in buckets full ....she did a good job.
This young man was raises correctly
But this cruel world accepts no loyalty
He was doing his Good Samaritan side quest.
This is great…. You rock Adrian!
It always pays to do a good deed in this life reward or not🤔
Amazing guy
In a world of the selfish and narcissistic, how refreshing to see the opposite.  Bravo to this young man.
See I would do that but what if they were so rude
I bet they gave him a good tag team after this haha. He deserves it.
Ooh good guuy!!
ITS NOT THE LOOKS  it is how you raised by your family. O.G. salute!!
it’s the way he was holding the purse🥺 he has a good spirit, god bless him🙏🏻
Reward: stay the night
La vie est belle 😻
اناناناحافاحالب
this fell is turning into what's the true meaning of being a real man  it starts only with honesty
Plot twist: The purse only had $17 so he returned it to get $3,000
Don’t judge a book by its cover! It’s what’s inside that you should take into consideration . 👏 young man
One of the better stories of this year so far
That's awesome! But I wish this wasn't news worthy, this should just be the norm.
💛☺️🙌
This foo mad more money that me in a day that I do I’m a month just returning a purse huh 🤔  Think I have to change my profession
This is definitely such a great thing in the US country we need to teach our kids so much more. They’re giving him a reward because he returned a purse 👜 But i just wanna add one thing that where I am working which is Saudi Arabia their kids already know they can’t take somebody’s purse or stuff. Here the kids have so much manners where they don’t steal or do such a thing . If we all have faith in God and thinks he’s watching us all time we would act just exactly like this kid
Good man. That's the way to be!
I love hearing stories like this.
Hes fine asl
Got raised by a good momma
God bless him
good young fella 💖
A woman  with a heart her purse  and contents,  to her were worth it KUDOS  to you , a rare beauty, and kindness  in today's  world  🌎 💖
Hope.
Finally something good on the news after years.
Wow if he was my son i would be so very proud of him. Respect young man!!
MashaAllah. Alhamdulillah. So very nice of that young man. God bless him.🙂
Young for that young man. He was raised like I did and taught the same principles. The same thing happened to me twice. One with an old guy dropped his wallet filled with hundred dollar bills and didn’t noticed. I saw it ran and picked it up before someone else did and gave it to him. He was so shocked because he didn’t know he dropped it and for me to find it and give it to him with all his money in there. He offered me something out of it and I say no sir have a bless day and he said who does things like this. Another incident I found a wallet walking by at a club. I looked inside to get an address and found a business card with a number on it. I called the number but no one answered. I called the following day and the owner finally answered. I told him I found his wallet and I would like to meet up with him to returned it. We did and he was amazed that I reached out to him and didn’t even took the money inside. They’re honest folks out man.
This world needs more decent & honest ppl like this  young guy ✌ it's acts like this that restore your faith in human nature 👏 an incredibly heartwarming story ✌
My stereotypically ‘bad boy’ looking boyfriend kept watch of this place where he found a lost wallet with $2000 and no ID in it. When the owner came looking around, he returned it after safekeeping. That’s why he is my husband of 6 years now ♥️
Good old mom
Plot Twist - he swiped the purse and realized he couldn't get away with fraud for the 2nd time so he heard there was a reward and decided to get the $$ that way. smart kid.
Moral of the Story: Give back what belongs to someone else and you will be rewarded that thing.
If Putin and the other world leaders could have a heart like this
That's what you get for a good deed Even though you shouldn't expect anything
If that was a pig they would of stole it
You Integrity matters most when no one is around you!
Is hope at the planet 🙌🏼 for sure he isn't trump supporter
Hope he doesn't start expecting that 😅 coz usually in the world good deeds don't go rewarded 😂😂😂 Great guy and hope he stays that way ❤❤❤
He's a man. Greets frm Russia.
I swear he knew that it belonged to that milf
This is sweet!
This is a true example of someone getting back what they gave.
In 3k dollar , three new nano Car can be buy. 😱
Good parenting and beautiful young man 🥰🤗 May he always be showered with blessings ❤️❤️❤️
Goodjob kid😘
sweet kid, he deserved it.
High honor +50
The 17 year old did the right thing by returning the purse
Look at adrian man so inspirational
that true when no one looking still do the right thing everone
You’re the sweetest guy ❤️💕
Great job! You make your momma proud. Also, dont judge the book by its cover.
So cute 🥰
I did that once where my 3k? 🤔😂
I went to a spring near my home yesterday and there were 2 elders in front of me, with 20-30 bottles to be filled. So i insisted to help them fill-up all of them, even tho i had only 3 bottles for me to fill. The lady turned to me and said: "Wow...long has passed since i've seen such a young man offering such a kind act." That struck me because it is really sad...that someone at arround 70 yrs old said such a thing.
I love to see random acts of kindness but just because he's young or part of a younger generation doesn't mean that anyone is incapable of being kind
Thank you to his Mother for raising an amazing kid. There is still hope for the future:)
WAIT HE FINE AND RESPECTFUL?
He cute asf
What a kind young man, God bless him and his family.
I just wanna know if the young man has gotten the go fund me money that was raised lol
great! now he can himself a belt
Good lad👍👍
Amazing
I love stories like this, especially when it involves this young generation. In so many places, theft is commonplace and it is great this teen returned the purse. He received a reward when he didn't expect it. What goes around comes back around.
there is no single "plot twist" post in these comments!
Awesome young man 🤗❤
Do they speak English in South.America?? 😳
Wow he is a supermen well done boy God bless you 🦸‍♂️
He returned it because he wanted some ass let's be real lol
He's so sweet
He is going to be  a good father .
hear me out...
Good people being good to one another. Love to see it. ❤️
Her friend had to speak on her behalf since the amount of botox she had injected into her mouth rendered it unuseable for breathing and talking
Why can’t someone just do a good deed and instead all over media🤔🙈
I’m so proud of mi gente! I remember being a little boy and stealing a piece of candy worth no more than 50¢ because we didn’t have a lot of money. When my mom found out, she made me apologize to the owner of the store. It taught me the value of hard work. MORALS START AT HOME!
Lovely lad 😍
I did a similar thing, but not as big. A couple of weeks ago, I found a wallet on our driveway. I checked inside if there was an ID and around $100. There wasn't, and I brought it inside. I was gonna wait if someone will come back for it. A while later, me and my mom said that I found a wallet. My aunt said that it was her sons wallet. He lost it last night. He was super happy and gave me $20.
Like why is this national news lol
The boy is cute huh
He's a good dude👏
what a warm news
If I was they would they tell me only thank you
Papi 🥰
Honestly we need more good people like him, the crime rate is very high nowadays.
Love is the way ❤
It just doesn't say something he is setting an example for a lot of people 😑
Good for him.
Now that’s a someone to look up too
don't believe...there're still got honest people nowday.
God Bless him
*I wood have not only kept the purse and all its contents, I wood have gone to the address to see if I could break in and burglarize it or maybe find one or both of these hos inside so I could have some fun with them.*
Hahaha
I have to say this is what we should all be like
Note : His mother taught him well by giving him good advice , 💯👌💯 Awesome !! It really shows , the young teen has a good heart ❤️... God bless you !!! Young man  !! 💯🙏💯.....
Lmao dude just wanted to meet that milf on the ID & got two for one, plus some cash...all in all win win win.  Mailman accidentally put a vibrator in my mailbox a neighbor ordered...best believe i hand delivered it.
👍
There’s good people everywhere,no matter the continent, no matter the country, no matter the province, no matter the state, no matter the city.
I returned someone's bag once and they screamed at me because some of their stuff was missing 🤣
He prob saw how hot she was in her license and wanted a peice of dat... I mean I would.
(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
If he was black  Cops would have been called. Would have been arrested for theft
yo i think i know her or somebody that looks exactly like her
Right on !
Plot twist: he followed the lady everywhere and end up in the mall. He had a Crush on Her 😍😍😍😍😍
I thought he stole it then pretended to return it bc of the thumbnail
These women didn't abuse him when he returned the purse. It's a miracle for me in this feminism world.
He did it for the cheeks
Thank God, none of these women filed a fake harrasment case against him. You can't trust this gend€r!
Great job 👏 youngsta
For him..to go out of his way and return it. That speaks Volumes about him. Great young man!!🥰 Your mom raised u right.😍
Ayyoooooo
how do we know, that he not still it?
What a simp
Many moons ago, in university I lost my wallet while going to the university bookstore to pick up textbook ($900USD).  Completely devastated when I noticed it was lost.  The VP of a big oil company found it on the subway and called the number I left in the wallet.  I was soooo grateful for it.  Had since found 10+ iphones / wallets and returned them all.  Also had my wallet returned 2 of 3 times I’ve lost it since that occasion.
God bless him
Well if i do a good deed i am expecting a 3k reward
Respect that’s all I gotta say
God bles u bro bro bro bro 🙏💯
Why can't everyone do that
dont do it. you have 5% chance of getting reward bigger than what you found. take it anyway. life lesson
It’s always good to be honest in life. The rewards will come to you ten fold 😀👍
Much respect ✊ 👏👏👏👏👏
I'm glad he was rewarded!
I am so proud of him =) My boys would do the same.. It is so nice to see this going on we DEFINITELY need this now!! Hes awesome <3 Props to his mother and father that taught him well. Glad to see this going viral as well to reach the masses that sometimes may do things not so nice.. I hope it inspires others... BB.
Love this gentleman for who he is never stop my friend
Great young man
He’s almost at 9,000 now!! 🙌🙌🙌👏🏽
Excellent words from his mom. This would make me so proud cause yes he could just gone thru it and then tossed the purse away. But to drive to that address wow!!! Wonderful young man. This is the type of news that needs to be shared.
This is the best news ever we need more of this world- wide..thank so much young man..
that's a person taught right since they were a child! good for his parents too!
A week later we find out it was staged and a go fund me for the kid disappeared so has the kid 😂.
God bless this young man
Look at Curry man
This is a teenager doing a good thing and this makes me so happy. This makes me want to cry because I’m seeing young kids doing kind acts. 😭😭
❤️❤️❤️
Fake...
I respect this kid
😁👍👍👍
Now he famous
Great Story here. Doing the right thing & returning what was not his. Taught this by his mother since he was young. Hope other kids learn from this.
What an absolute legend. His mother must be so proud ❤️
Phenomenal 🙏🏼
For all of yall who think all Mexicans steal no they dont!
If i am that teen, I would like to ask for threesome with these beautiful women 😍  rather than 3k reward 😉
Yup! Mom & Pops taught me that to! Always do the right thing, even when nobody's looking! Good job young man! 👏 ❤❤
Honesty is the best policy
Very sweet thing to do👍☺️
Omg at 1:22 on the mini pavement I thought that was a snake 😭😭
That’s good I want to do it every time but unfortunately I won’t anymore let me explain why. I’m half French and I live in France since I always have many different sized packages delivered to me, the delivery guy made a mistake. He gave me my package but also the neighbor’s living in my residence by mistake. Since I always order, I didn’t know one of them wasn’t mine so I opened all of them I recognized one of them then I knew that the other one wasn’t mine I tried to call back the delivery guy but only them can call us. So I started to look everywhere on the packaging to see if there was any  information about the right owner and I didn’t found anything but fortunately there was a receipt inside so I was able to call the owner. Everything was good during the phone call since I’m a student I don’t really have free time but that day I waited for him to be free so that I can give him his package. I even went to his appartement to give him his package and you know what happened ? I rung his doorbell I saw him looking peephole and I also heard his footsteps plus he said he was at home himself. I started to explain that I’m the neighbors who accidentally got his package and he let me behind his door during 15 minutes I waited that long since I gave him the benefit of the doubt and this was quiet stupid of me. He never opened his door he just kept staring at me through the peephole the whole time. I abandoned and get back to my appartement with his package I wrote him a letter and let it in his mailbox. Since his package was quiet expensive I wanted to give it to him directly like we agreed I wasn’t sure if it was really him in his house that’s why I kept it. He came to my apartment this time a few hours later he apologized and said « I’m really sorry it’s not that I hate PEOPLE LIKE YOU 🤡 in fact I love them it’s wasn’t me it’s was my wife » This man wasn’t even married and it was definitely him since he told me himself that I can bring his package but when he discovered through the peephole that I was mixed black he didn’t opened🤡
Wow!  Love this boy!  Your mom brought you up well...
POV there was nothing good in the purse
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
he's hot and masculine. love that gangster type low voice vibe
Amen,that's nice it was returned he will be rewarded see
Good job mom!!
I’m sure he seen her leave it and was like imma get that
Shidddd the lady was so fine that he was hoping to wife her..lol
Absolutely Awesome
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Good dude.
There is hope for this generation this kid just proved it ...his mom should be very proud of him .....
Hats off to the good parents!!
But remember kids, if it ain’t a rich ass Mexican house hold just take the money inside the bag
Lol he probably stole it and then returned it 😂
Jesus loves you
Goodness, she got enough plastic in her face?
It's sad to see that being good and doing good deeds these days become unusual and rarely happen.
I am very proud of him even though I don’t know him.  😊
👏👏👏🙌🙌
I love this amazing 🙏❣️
How about the woman not giving him any cash.  She did a go fund me.  20 bucks🤣🤣🤣🤣 he used that in gas.
This is great to see
Dawg was tryna hit
Why is it so praised to do a normal thing like this
I can hear the honor increase sound effect.
Way to break down racial stereotypes young man!
There is still hope for humanity
Right tf on
I love when a kid is humble and respectful
I thought it was slim shady..
Jesus loves y’all
My dad returned a man’s wallet and the man gave him $300
Wow.... This is such a nice story. Good Luck to that young man.
Way to go young man!
This is Awesome 😇🤗
Good job man! We need more people like him!
Thank you for rewarding this kid! This is something that we should all learn from❤️👏
They look like they do only fans lol 😂

And if there was $$$ in the purse...adios $$$😂🤣
Upstanding young man. Wonderful story.
A Special Guy,   GOOD will come his way..
Good for you, young man!👍
Such a cute story x
Thumbs down for fake story 😂 People believe anything on the news and social media. Know wonder our country is upside down 🤦‍♂️
Proud of this young gentleman 😀
Yay!
As it should be! You do unto others as you have them do unto you! This is the golden rule!
Now it's Trending? More obvious this is Fake asf 😂
Another great example of good parenting.
That's awesome! His parents raised him right!
What a good young gentleman he is. Props to his mum for raising a good kid x
He was raised right!! Good job kid!
The feeling you get from watching this is priceless. Wish the world was more like this! Awesome job
I remember losing my purse at the mall  with money inside around Christmas and some nice person turned it in and didn’t take any of the cash inside, good people do still exist.
Still some hope out here in this crazy as world 💯
I just saw you on the news. Thank you for being honest. God be with you.
losers he should have kept it.
A testament to his up bringing, Proud Mama.  Best compliment a child can give to his parents/mom/dad/grandma. Lots of continue Blessing to you young man.
Wooo yeah👏👏👏👏
wowowowowowowowowowow this incredible and made my entire day! God bless that young man <3
Woow
He is being raised well. Everyone should follow HIS good deed.🇺🇸
thats it.. good job!
And his Mama
Good for you.  When my little sister, 56 today, was about 10 yrs. old she found a wallet packed to the gills with large bills.  She asked mom for advice, how to conduct herself.  Mom answered, Well you have to make a choise, or to keep it for yourself or to see if it can be restored to the owner.  She knocked on the door, it opened.  I found your wallet.  He took it with no thanks or reward.  Its no wonder she does'nt want to get married.
This just warms the heart; what a fine, young man! Hat off to his mother!
Plot twist: he stole the purse.
It does speak a lot about him, his mom did a great job raising him. Always do the right thing even when no one’s watching
Yay!
How do you know he didn’t just steal and then return it for 3k
What a wonderful young man ❤️❤️ you did a great job mom ❤️❤️
We have many great young ppl but they get overshadowed by the bad apples.  I left a wallet in a grocery cart.  It was turned in to the store, intact.
A stand up young man!!
good news! nice decent guy
Always do the right thing. 🙏 Save 200+ lives every year. 💖 Choose vegan
I know this wont get to the right ppl, but I've lost my wallet to my knowledge, at least 3 times in my life and some has always turned it into the front office or customer service. Thank you to all that returned/turned in my wallet! But i cant say the same to my $300 bluetooth song earbuds that fell outta my backpack, it was a string bag and i had a small hole i wasnt aware of till i was tryna watch some YT. Kudos to this young man! What the world needs more of! He def deserved the reward!
This cool kid😎deserves a standing ovation from the whole city.👽🤙👍🤛
he can return a purse but can't wear a belt.
Well raised
Among all the horrible things happening right now, good deeds like this give me a glimmer of hope for the future.
💯💯💯💯✊🏾
May the Lord bless him always and glad the lady got her purse back
Simple… he’s a good person; he was raised right!💕☺️
He can afford a belt now!
See not everyone bad
This is so amazing
♥️Love this !!
Idk but I’ll smash them as a reward
Well done young man
His giving me I stole it bringing right back vibes!. Sorry don't believe this story!.
He is one in a million.
He returned it without expecting anything Do the math
I googled and I’m happy to say his go fund me is at almost 9 thousand dollars as of right now. (June 30 8pm)
Good job Adrian and good job Adrian’s mom!!
Wdym there's hope for the new generation?
What  a descent young Man ,,Very respectful & a Good Samaritan  👍  ,Good on you  ,,,
Bravo young man,hats off to your mom.
There’s good news tonight 😊
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Why they do a GoFundMe... When she should've paid out of her pocket? 🤷 If you going to open a gofundme you better match the total... Or better yet, once he is found you can ask him if he has a venmo or zelle so other people can directly send him money...
This could’ve turned into a porn
He looked at that id and seen that the lady is gorgeous that’s why he returned it 😂 he was tryna get rewarded with something else lol
Great kid!

This keeps my faith in  mankind seeing things you loos faith nut such incidences boost your moral. Thank you for the video of a real hero.
Yea dudes got clout
Good kid!!!💜💜💜 Great parents!!!!
What a kind gesture. He's a legend!
If I saw her fine ass in the driver’s license best believe ima come back and shoot my shot like this fine young gentlemen. They raised 3k? That’s a sign to come inside brother !!
Plot twist.....17 year old steals purse and returns it for the reward money.
I just came to read the "if he was black" comments
Aww so commendable
There's still hope for this world.
I found a man’s wallet on the beach in Hilton Head and delivered to his house . His wife thanked me. Apparently they were horseback riding on the beach and it must have fallen out. He later caught up with me and accused me of stealing the money that was in it. I was so shocked. I didn’t even know what to say. I remember thinking I should have left it on the beach where I found it.
in other words, "don't judge a book by its cover"
U see the importance of not judging by cover? Very proud of this kid
Great parenting great values. You see folks - That's how you bring up a kid.
Dang he putting in the best work here haha . I'd be following up with this cutie😁🤣
I hope this young man gets blessed
Bless his ❤ ❤ 💙
Good kid! Needs a PS5!😁
He put himself into the other persons shoes and had sympathy and empathy to do the right thing. Do unto others that you want others to do onto you, you're a real one young man.
Good young man with morales and integrity!!! More of the younger generation NEEDS to follow him!!!
Should've called the police and locked that thug up
Good Man!
He is a sweetheart for doing the right thing. What a great man  he is! So happy 😊 😃
He whippin an audi jit dont need it 😂
Plot twist: he was just trying to hit 😎
💜💜💜
Last year, I found a man's wallet in a parking lot of a restaurant. I thought about dropping the wallet off at the restaurant but decided to hand deliver the wallet to the owner to make sure it got returned to him. It had his ID, other cards and money inside. Said he was a veteran.  It took me a while to find his apartment, but I eventually found it. I knocked on his door and asked if he was "so and so" and he replied that he was. I told him that I had found his wallet and was returning it to him. The look on his face, he told me he thought he had lost it for good and even called the restaurant. He offered $20 but I didn't accept it. I just wanted to make sure that it got returned to the right owner and would like for someone to do the same for me. The smile on his face was more than enough.
What a sweet boy. He did the right thing when no one was watching. Good for him. Thank you all for rewarding such a fine young man.
That's the way is usto be , you just return what's not yours because it's what you would like someone to do if you lost your wallet/ Purse. Now it's I Miracle if you get it returned and  you have to give a HUGE REWARD. 🤔
I love it because he wasn’t expecting anything in return. Well deserved
SUCH A SWEET STORIE!!!!💝🥰
Thank you sir
Blessings upon blessings unto Dis young man!!!
You know he stole it right ? 🤣
Bravo all around!!!
Great young man!!!  It’s definitely a breath of fresh air seeing this than dumb@$$ TikTok videos, dumb@$$ kids eating tide pods and etc.  I hope this young man keeps up with this attitude, he is going to get far in life, especially he is already way ahead than most of his peers 🤣
aww that’s so sweet 😭
Repent Israelites all praise to most high YAHAWAH AND HIS SON YAHAWASHI🙏🏽🛸🛸🛸🛸🤴🏽🦁⌛️🔥🔥🔥🔥🙏🏽
Good for that young man. Good job Sir.
*🗣️FINALLY some good news in the algorithm 🙌🏽🗣️*
Awesome story
God bless this young man 🙏
This is who we all should be !
Amazing man👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
He was raised right by good parents
Yes I rewarded him very generously  SO I just had to post so everyone can see  WHY
He had better gotten some good WAP after that
There's hope! 🙂
That’s so great!
Oh so the purse owner didn't 🙄 gave the Reward! QUE TACAÑA!
Good kid
you will gave to excuse me for being more than just a little suspicious about the story....
Foo seen the ID and knew he had to meet her... Foo wanted to smash
On the other hand, the person who stole my purse (& that of another colleague) from the nurses' station, returned our purses (minus money; only with our IDs and keys) on the pretense that he found them on the side of the road. We gave him rewards, only later to find out from the police that he had a criminal record.
I would of done the same. I’m too humble to do something cruel and not return it
This  and similar cases of good parenting is the reason we still have an earth.  Parents we hold the future in our hands. Raise good kis with morales and ethics like this mother and son and keep the world spinning
How much you want to bet Donald Trump nor Joe Biden would’ve returned that purse? These corrupt politicians can learn a lot from this teen.
That boy has forever created good karma. God doesn't sleep! Good kid! Love and blessings to him always!
Just outstanding. Great young man.
Why is this news
Aww his parents raise him well
He Sweet Fine Man... Always Doing The Right Thing Even When No One Is Watching. 🥰🥰
This isnt news
Maybe he can buy a belt . Good job though
The aunt is a hottie.❤️
We need MORE Humans like this!💯💯
His parents should be very proud of him❣️
Good at you young man, good at you
Now here’s a man that’s been brought up right😀❤️❤️❤️
You know he was raised soo well... I really believe, its really up to the parents how a kids should act or behave... and it shows...
I would of taken it to her to.
His Mom raised him right, she has a good legacy in that young man.
Good kid!
The flip side of this is if he had gotten pulled over on his way to return the purse he would likely be accused of stealing it and the same people on here talking about how he's the savior of the world would be scolding him and talking about locking him up and throwing away the key.
Thanks mom for raising him right. 🥰👍🏻👍🏻
Nice good story of a good person I like this
His mom taught him well
Good job kid and one time this lady dropped her wallet and she didn't even give me a reward OK so your real lucky kid but I wasn't even expecting an award though OK but she did at least say thank you though OK that was enough I guess so OK
My nana is Eliana:)
Love to see this what a great guy!
🐨🇦🇺🦘👏👏👏🙌
This warms my heart 💖
That young man has character.God bless him,and his mother for helping him grow it! Gives me faith in the next generations.
There's hope for younger generation.
Love this 💙💙💙
Just reading the title warms my heart. Just like everyone else is saying, people should be raised to be like this and be nicer everyday.
First
Good young man, his Mother did a GREAT job raising him!!!!❤❤❤💯👏👏👏
that was so nice of him
I actually had a couple bring my elderly disabled step dads wallet to his, and my moms home. He accidently left it on the gas pump.  They waited until he got back to give it to him directly.  He hadn't even realized it was gone yet.  I don't know how much he insisted on rewarded them.  I thanked them repeatedly.  Very kind of them to go out of their way to return it.
The definition of integrity!👍🏽
He is so sweet and was definitely raised right. 😊
his mother will be proud
always do the right thing. but don't Fake it
Respect 👏
That's the way. To do it. Show our young people. That there is still good in the world. That you will get blessed. If you do the right thing. Even when no one is looking. God keep and bless. This handsome young man.
Unfortunately what happens most of the time is the family usually ends up suing the person who returned the belongings because AMERICA. Oh yeah and if you save someone who is drowning they’ll sue you too. Best not to get involved.
What a wonderful young man! 💙 A son to be proud of!
Let's be honest if she wasn't the person in the ID he wouldn't have returned it 🤣
ik why he did it
yall should learn from this man
Next time I steal a purse and bring it back, I get 3k? Lol
anyone know where i can find the full video without the cuts
Is anyone else gonna say it?😏😅…….
He is probably the one that stole it
During 1 week back in 2017 i was skateboarding and on 3 seperate occassions i found a wallet in front of 3 random individuals houses on their cars. Swore i was being punked lol. I returned each of them to the house i thought it belonged to and didnt mind not recieving a reward. Just felt good to do what i would want someone to do for me. Its the right thing.
This generation gon be good with kids like him.
What a sweet heart I needed that dose of seratonin today. Love people with good hearts and deeds
Hopefully a member of Zion will preach to him also!
What you put into the world you get back!!
Oh he’s fine lord have mercy
They both Spanish so it's ok.
This is America
I found an Iphone 13 pro at a Winners store and gave it back to customers service, the next day I left my own Iphone at an another winners store in the bathroom went back and some had returned to Customer service as well :)! Always do good because eventually it will come back to you!
Lol he took it to return it later as if it was really "found". 🤭
If he was black he would had taken the loot 😂
Bro she lookes like the grinch 😭😭😭
Dressed like a gangsta with tattoo on his arms . All i can say is he's raised well . Please be proud mom dad . 🙏
“Kindness is always rewarded💗”  - some wise person
“Fine young man” I’m sorry that’s funny to me lol not in a bad way
Wow he is a good samaritan must know him the whole world👏👏👏
Love this ❤
Thata boy!
ive done this multiple times and it feels soooooooo good to do something good for someone you didnt know ‼️
and that's where it starts. Parents.
Isn't it normal to return someone item normal in america?
and here i am getting scammed out of 3,800 by a contractor 😭 this kid has more integrity than a grown man
Good guy! Bless your heart
He may look like a gangsta in the outside but he's a angel in the inside.
Thank you young man you have made my day eith your kindness and pray that God bless you ten fold.
SO very wonderful to see a good young man like this & know that though he expected nothing he was rewarded!
Tight.
This is beautiful 💯 😍
And the funny thing is that he dresses like who you'd expect not to return it back.
he so fine .
Looks can be decieving..
Kudos to mom 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾❤️ for instilling goodness and not hatred in her son.  The Bible is so true when it says in PROVERBS 22:6 KJV "Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.
He cute cute
plot twist. it was a setup. All it took was some acting and they made $3750 off some strangers.
He probably saw the DL and thought she was bomb 😂 trying to shoot his shot 😂
I did that once. After a few hours of job hunting and handing in CVs, I found a guy's wallet just outside the Subway I had just lunch in. Had over £200 in it. Found the guy's name, but no number or address, and handed in the lost and found. Got a nice text message the next day thanking me so much for returning it. A couple of weeks later, I lost my wallet purse in the same area. Only realized when i looked in my shopping bag to find a hole in the bottom and it had fallen out. It too was handed in straight away. Nothing was taken (not much money to take anyway XD) I was more worried about my bus card.
This is a wonderful story. I'm so happy he is getting a big reward!! But even if there's no reward the Bible says,we don't have to tell about our good deeds, our father in heaven  rewards them. Mathew 6:1
He would have loved to spend some time with them instead of those 3k, if u know what i mean
Huh but when 12 yo me returned the bag, the woman called the cops on me amd insulted and yelled at me cuz she thought i stole her 50€ ...turned out she forgot that she spent the 50 € the day before   :')
I still have have hope for young generations and much more God bless this man who returned the purse I still have hope that the world will be saved Amen  🙏
Good son
When I left mine they took the money but returned ID and rest to police. 😆 Be nice to know if you had money in there
His mom should be so proud of the wonderful young man she raised! We need more people like this young man and his mother in the world. Blessings to them both!
I teach my kids the same because my parents raised me this way. I only hope my son and my daughter do this if they ever find something. Good job to not only him but his parents.
People who tell the will 1 day get a reward
Good for him. I am glad there is still honesty out there!
Proud of this young man
Very good young man 👍🏽🙏🏽
You’re a good man!
What a responsible young man! Amen California 🙏🏿
Good job young man 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
This is not the first time something like has happened my dad found a a ladies wallet one time and we went to go return it to her and same thing that has happened here the lady moved different places hasn't changed her address and the owner who lived knew her and gaved it to her.
I love it when someone has the courage to break the typecast mold others (including their peers) have forced them into.  He didn't follow the crowd but did the right thing.
🙏🏼🥰👍👜
good ish good on him 👍 need more folks like that
Hey good job!
0:07 sorry but there isn't. You got extremely lucky but you can't say that there's hope for this generation unfortunately.
Good people still in the world. Bless him.
I’ve never seen inside edition trending I’ve been watching for years (guess I don’t pay attention)
Keep it 💯
Lucky guy, I returned a phone I found on the bus one time and all I got was a thank you.
so much respect to his mum, and total respect for listening to his mum and doing a good deed, enjoy your reward you deserve it xxx
BEAUTIFUL 💪🏽💯
This is the kind of Mexicans trump was warning you about
Someone stole my purse and I had the id mailed back to me from a Ywca lol at least they did one good deed
Good thing to do. Too bad he is dressed like he wants to be part of a street gang.
Guy is obviously from the hood but has a heart on him rare scene
Is it just me or he cute asf
Good kid gonna be a good man soon . Much respect for him and his mom . He is an example of how everyone should be.
Good job dude! You'll go far in life. Kudos to your parents for being there for you, giving you a set of morals.
You must report a change of address within 10 days
Only if that was me
What a sweet young gentleman. His parents raised him right. Good job young man
I wish that ain’t found me ;)
Naw this nigha gave it back cause he saw the license & thought he was gonna get some cheeks stop 🧢🤣
What a young gentlemen...
He could have gotten easy money take the money in the purse
It's called ETHICS....thank you Adrian...
heartwarming.......wat a sweet kid
Someone raised there son properly. We need more good people like this very honest young man.
Man of principles 😎👍
everyone is saying good job mom, but i say good job son as well, cause everyr one can be taught something and threow it outbut 100% proud of him for choosing to be decent on his own
God bless him and be his strength always god bless him 🙏 amen
Found woman's keys n iD, found address on internet, stopped and left a note.  Instead of $3k, she called the police and I had to play 20? As to why I went by the house etc.  I'm 50y old, going to meet a cop at 2am in a parking lot to explain myself, I like this story much better!
This guy is jessie pinkman
Power of good parenting.
3k like 785 dollar is catpee
BEST MAN😇
He just wanted to possibly get laid. Lol
ma boi saw the drivers license pic of her and wanted to hit
Edgar
sorry but if i find money during these inflated times you sorry out of luck lol
She must've been drunk ..how do you forget your purse in a shopping cart. A whole purse
I love to see people get rewarded extra!! 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
The lady on the left was the one that made it all happen. If it was up to the lady on the right it would be a "geee thanks Mr"
Hope he gets that money so this Yung man can go to school ♥️
Rare. Nice guy!
not gonna lie but he look like thug kid with tattoos, guess looks can be deceiving
❤️🥳
Good kid still existe
Good job, little one.
Many blessings to him :) good job !!
This should be automatic... anyways good job by the teen!!!
The fact that this is news tells us how troubled our world is. We look at this gentleman’s act as an anomaly and not the norm. That’s a problem.
Kudos to his mom!! Right upbringing can definitely change the world 🙌🙌
Good job mama, 👏👏👏she must be proud.
He became the change he wanted to see in the world. Humanity desperately needs more people like him. It’s really nice to see wholesome and heartwarming acts of good deeds like this more often.
he returned it and she rewarded him..both did the right thing..he's a outstanding young man also don't judge a book by it's cover there's alot of good people out there that just because they look a certain way doesn't mean they're going to steal your purse smh
Best story from US
This brings me hope for humanity 💕
That's awesome my wallet fell out of my car while in Chicago highway pay stop and I got it back without the thousands inside. They might as well kept it
Why because he’s drees in cholo clothes,why because MS 13 gangsters will jump you fool,looks like he did the right thing and say the right words,finally some one to look up to. He’s amazing. There’s not a lot in the 🏖swimming out there, I hate this war
No that's a real man that has life  Under control,
I've returned purses, money, debit cards, and other dropped items, but never had to go too far to do so.
Yes Adrien 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Do the right thing even when the security cameras watch
I’ve found and returned many wallets and debt cards. Must be my assignment from God.
1 in a million now days 🙏
I’m glad he got 3k
This is awesome! It's sad that this shouldn't be glorified because it's the right thing to do but our society usually goes the other way. Hats off to this kid for doing the right thing. We want more people like you in our society.
Thanks for sharing!!!!
I returned a credit card once to the bank it was from, nothing happened, I didn’t get anything. Am I bitter? A little, but life goes on… Doing the right thing feels good though.
Glad the 2 ladies went out of their way to reward him. We need more good ppl to be randomly rewarded. 🤍
Respect!
That's awesome.  Good job dude 👏
Pfft. Wasn't even their money. Was money from gofund.  Chi'ren in afrqa could've used that 3k
Beautiful
"lost"
sounds fishy
what city this foo from
My mom found wallet full of cash 2x, belonged to the neighbours. Got chocolate;) i found indurance cards, searched for the person, found it and brought it to them. Found ID card, brought it to police. Forgot bag with wallet in store, ran back, and some couple found it and brought it to the cashier. Didnt want any reward. The same when i forgot money in atm... world is full of good people when nobody is watching:)))
Finally a good piece of news
We’ll I did it because My mom always….Me: 1 second pause ….starts balling 😭 Made me think of my Mommy and the things she said to me
GOOD MAN!
Was the money that was raised actually given to the person instead of some stories where it was cashed by the people that posted it like the people that did one for the homeless guy.
Definitely a good deed! God rewarded him 3x more! 💗🥰
What a great young man, obviously raised the right way. Salute to you, young man!
Intergity Always!
Good yute .. keep it up
God bless this child going out and coming in, amen
Yeah! In corrupted USA this is now big deal...
More news like this please!
Would’ve done the same
🤔👏🙏❤️🇺🇲🇲🇽👍😍
Also, he didn't go about making himself the bigger person. He humbly said his mom taught him to do the right thing even when no one's watching. That's a fine gentleman right there! 💯❤ God bless him! 🙏
You can actually get THAT lucky for doing the right thing?!
Karma never sleeps! you get back what you put out!! wonderful young man!!💕
No interview with the kid? :/
“Nah deadass bro it was just sitting there”
Why does he have to dress like that though?
wow that makes me smile
Can you imagine his shock, receiving almost $4,000 ❤️. I'd love to see his reaction 🎉☺️🔥. That would help towards a good education, whatever he chose to pursue ☺️
May God Bless you Mijo great work Mijo
Not everyone’s a thief, a lot of people have a good character.
Nice young man!!!
Raised well to do the right thing. Great job
Yeah but don’t wear the uniform of a lowlife…..
awwe  good guy <3
Good kid👍🏿
A fine example of parenting done RIGHT!! I’m so happy he’s being recognized but special shout out to his mom!!! You did good, mama💗
If people  see me knocking  on their door. They would  not open it. The outside might look like a killer but the in is full of love. Don't judge a book by its xover, folks.
Yeees good man
im sorry but does anyone know his insta or something😭he’s fineeee🙏🏼
He was just trying to get high honor for a higher discount at Walmart lmao
Lost my wallet a month ago and the person returned it with all the cash and cards intact.  He went out of his way to fine me as well as I had moved from the address on my license.  I still have faith in this type of stuff.  I would return whatever I found .  Good for him, It's sad that this stuff surprises us.
Yeah, San diego.
Doing good things without anyone watching makes you feel better about yourself. He just thought for others rather than himself.
That's a good young man. News organizations control the news cycles.... We need more stories like this one
Compare that kids morals to Donald trumps. ….case closed.
What a good kid!
I love this!! Fabulous young man.
Salute to this young man!
How beautiful! What a great story!
My ex & I found a couples checkbook.  Full of checks.  So, we called him on the phone number listed on his personal checks.  He didn't realize he'd lost it.  So we offered to "drive it to his home" When we handed it to him he said "ok" & shut the door in our faces.
I would like to donate to this how?
Omg at my current job a costumer forget his Wallet in the bathroom with $600 in it, he came the next day all stressed asking if we found it and a costumer had actually found it and gave it to us, he said he’d give the person half the money if he knew who it was he was just so happy the money was still in there
Community man i tell ya
What a good person 👍😊
Great story 👏🏾
The fact people get paid for just doing the RIGHT thing is kind of wow
A win for humanity! Wooooo
The world would change so much just if people did the right thing.
He probably knew he was gonna get paid for returning it lol I mean everything from that purse to the crib just screams money.
How dare she not update her address, such an inconvience
I’m glad everyone posting positive comments not like the news and media’s calling people like him rapist and murders just saying
His mother need recognition as well.
WOW, Everytime I see good things like this . It gives HOPE.❤️
So nice to see💕🙏
just goes to show you can't judge a book by its cover
He was blank from the waist down
In the '70s when I was a teenager I found a purse in the park. There were some phone numbers inside the purse and we managed to get a hold of the lady who lost it. She came to our house to get the purse and brought her husband and two other large men. She accused me of stealing the purse and she brought the men to beat me up. She looked through the purse and said everything was there and then she said she's going to call the police. My mother was the kind of Mama Bear nobody messed with her kids, she straightened them out real quick. They went away angry and I learned a valuable life lesson.
The sad thing is that this is news, rare events, it should not be a rare event of people doing the right thing but sadly it is. Think how much better the world would be if everyone did this
❤❤❤❤❤
hes so haot
Lovely human god bless him
this is so great!!!
yup…time to go retrieve  lost purses
They only gave him the $3K because he was cute and well off, if it was a black teen who did this, they would probably give him a bubble gum or candy.
Adrian…you the real MVP.  Bless you, sir.
👏👏👏👏👏
That's is a blessing good job young man. Your mother raised u right. God bless you and much love❤❤❤
In my experience, this man is the rule, not the exception. It seems to be due to the fact that bad news gets more attention.  Good on this man for doing it right. Your parents raised you well.
Good job buddy!
that this needs to go viral is sad. this is a normal thing to do in my eyes. i can't imagine keeping a purse to yourself if it's not yours. i had someone reach out to me when i lost mine and i was so thankfull people like that exist. i had quit some money in it and nothing was missing. good people do still exist, it's just rare. i myself couldn't live with the tought of keeping stuff that belongs to someone else. the guilt would destroy me
This is the best story ever,  I needed to see it! Yes ❤🙏
😉👍🏻
Prop to the young man.
What a wonderful story in today's world.   Good parenting is NOT a lost art!   Congratulations to the young man and his parents!
Raised right and a cutie
Clearly staged. He looks like someone who'll break into your home and be off with your TV faster than you can say, "Teeeffff".
What A WONDERFUL YOUNG MAN. GOD BLESS you, great job parents you should be very proud💕♥!
my name is also adrian rodriguez lol
He’s sooooo freaking HOTT TOO‼️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
What a sweet young man
So nice to hear the good in the world instead of all the bad all the time.   Good job bud.  Keep your course and great things will happen for you.
We need more honest people like homie.
Awesome 👌
Very good kid!! His mom raised him well!!! Good job mom 👍😊❤️
The few good people
EXCELLENT JOB YOUNG MAN!!!!
“My mom told me to do the right thing when no one is watching” the teachers use that quote a lot at school and they have built a pretty healthy environment
AMAZING ❤❤❤
Great kid👍🏻
He probably did this then shot at one of his opps later that day
I have also returned many lost wallets, credit cards and phones but never got any rewards.  Now that I have lost everything in life, no one is giving me that same kindness back.😞
one good deed spawns another. pay it forward my friends.  it's the only way out of this mess!!  Adrian Rodriguez - Role Model.
Everyone has to do this. I have found a mobile phone several times and then given it to the owner
have faith in humanity.
He sooo cute damnn
Do a follow up where they give him the gofundme money. Hate to see these people take advantage of the situation and keep that donation for themselves.
Great dude
Bravo for this young gentleman !!! 🙏☺🌺
Young man, thanks for being upstanding and making a  good story come outta SoCal today!
The perfect future husband
raised right
❤️❤️❤️
So awesome. Both sides
Fake
The dark haired one 😍
I bet he was hoping to get her number
His mom raised him right and he is an obedient son.  God bless them both
My faith in humanity just got a little better! 😌🙏😇
This should be on the news
*Brazzers*
I mailed a wallet back once because it was from out of state.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Dumb  Nobody Would have done the same for you  Especially no damn female
good hearted young man. im only 18 myself and i hope i never get corrupted by todays society, to carry myself the way this kid did. :))
Do you think he seen the driver's license picture, then got his haircut, and then went to return/ meet her?  yes he could have taken the money out and still returned but then she would not be elated and except his dinner proposal.
Integrity is a good thing. Great Man👏🏾👏🏾
Where is this gofoundme page? I want also to give, show the world this is the right way !
See there BUT been judging guys like this forever. Waaay to go Adrian R. 👑 Most Men don't want your purse and wish the best for you especially when saving up for your toddlers college because it's going increase when it's their time. ☮️ 👨🏼‍🏫👩🏼‍🏫🧑🏾‍🏫
God bless this wonderful young man.
Don’t care
I love this story! Stand up kinda of guy for sure! 🤟🏽
The thing is, this young man is living by Christian principles. The very principles American society is rebelling against. Good for him, shame on America for leaving the principles of the ONLY TRUE GOD.
I know we shouldn’t be praising someone for doing the right thing, but good job to this guy.
Good job young man!
How conscience he is. He would probably have been all of women's dream guy temporarily
1:12 just keepin' it real 😂
Or... there casing the place.  Hope not. Just saying. Eitherway the chips lay, don't be so quick to judge 😒
he wanted some snu snu, be honest
The women on the left is very pessimistic
👏🏼🥲GO BOY! & dressed like a "Thug" 😁🥰🤣 SO HAPPY FOR HIM!!! Cute too.☺️
His parents raised a fine young man!
Good kid
Wow $3,000 reward for bringing back a person thats amazing such a nice young man well deserved!
Now there is a great kid and raised the right way.
Give young people a chance. I’m sure just because of the way he was dressed and his ethnicity some people would think the opposite of him. Great job young man! That is how we change minds!
Unfortunately in today's world, him taking that from the shopping cart could have caused a scene if someone saw it. Also, if a dude knocks on my door at that time of night, he won't be greeted with kindness right away. We've gone so far from friendliness and honor, it's so sad. Kudos dude for doing the right thing! Put that on your resume 🤣
What a wonderful 17 year old!!
Good for him!!! 👏🏾 always do the right thing, no matter who’s watching or not.
Instant Karma :) good version
love this:)
Bravo 👏👏👏👏👏👏
there is still wonderful people in the world
aw, this story was heart warming! It's amazing!
What a good boy.
Beautiful
He looks like a LA cholo. i guess don’t judge a book by its covers lol
World could be like this but yall judge instead
Bad vidieo
Why does this have 2 million views in less than a day lol
adrien rodriguez fine asl im tryna find him too 😭
Wow if I was his mother I would be so proud of him!!!! That is how you know  you’re doing right!!! What a beautiful gesture!!! I’m glad he was able to get $3k as a reward!!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Very proud of you young man!!!!
✌️👌🙏📖🌏🌎🌍👍
Dios te bendiga…a ti hijo y a tu familia y por las damas que te recompensaron.
It's sad that we need a reward for something that should be called common sense
Doing the right thing even when nobody saw. The kid raised well by his mother who teach him that. God bless him and the mother.
In your face, people. There's kind people people in this world and also in those you would never expected too. GOD bless Adrian Rodriguez. Thats a real man with characteristics of an Angel and GOD.
Trust it's plenty of us out here👍🏽👍🏽
So...uh has their home been robbed since?
Is Rodriguez like the default Mexican surname
Integrity is doing the right thing when nobody is watching.......
Nice story.
That’s sad that this is big news. I mean all he did was returned a purse I understand it’s a good deed but it’s something everybody should do no matter what. It shouldn’t be big news that somebody returned a purse.
One thing for sure,  is that God is ALWAYS watching! And He will definitely remember that good deed when that young man stands b4 Him one day! Good job bro!😊👍🙏
He had great parents...
Just because he got the stereotypical thug outfit doesn’t mean he ain’t a good guy. That’s another thing to look out for guys
👍🏻
We need more people like this kid in the world.
Good job mom, you raised a real one! This young man deserves every blessing that comes his way.
Parents did nothing
Black person would’ve kept it. Took the money out then threw it away smh
I found a purse about two years ago and brought it directly to the police station.
God bless this young man in every way 🙏. This shows 🙏 that  his parents taught him well and it instilled in him. We need so many like him to take example and always do the right thing.
No I’m not crying, you’re crying🥹💜
W dude
He is a good kid and was brought up right. His parents should be proud.
What a great kid!!
I love a good story 😃
Integrity, thank you son! 😊
There  was probably  only $20 in the purse......so that why he did it...😆😆
Here in Ghana a taxi driver returned   Gh¢8400.00( $1041.15) to a passenger who was a business woman. The woman mistakenly left her money in the car probably after hectic Friday  work. During the weekend the woman wept uncontrollably and was being consoled by her sisters not knowing how she lost the money. The money was also not solely hers making her so dreadful of what will happen next. Miraculously on the following Monday, the taxi driver, who knew the woman as a regular customer returned to the woman's house with the full money. She couldn't believe it, she wept and bowed in front of the honest driver to thank him for his magnanimity, it was absolutely emotional and beautiful to onlookers and people who saw it on social media. The honest cab driver has  recieved almost Gh¢50,000($6,197.30) sum of money from funds made for him, a renowned Pentecost church, recieved money also from some celebrities and some politicians here in Ghana.  This is reward for kindness 👏.
Oh how proud his mother must be!!!!
He got that Audi he good he don’t need the purse 😂
Lou Williams?
✔️
😢bless his heart
Bro looks 29
Thank you Lors for his good upbringing!!

I remember in the late 90's I left my wallet on the city bus and someone found it and returned it to me at my apartment later that day (I believe). I gave the person some money. This brought that memory back. =)
Maybe he wanted to meet the owner of the ID? Just saying 😁
Anyways, what's his @ ? He too damn fine 🤤🤤🤤
This makes the news in the kind of world we live in these days .
His momma raised him right! ❤️
speaks alot about our world that this makes news when it usto be a given. sad sad sad.
This is what should be trending
I hope, wish and pray this young gentleman has the greatest life you could ever imagine, he's off to an excellent start!!! God bless!!
This speaks volumns for this young mans character.   I am a mother of 3 grown children and I  would like to think they would do the same.   I'm sure his mother is so proud of him.  🤗🥰
Purrrr
Awesome job young man you have restored my faith in humanity
It's a true story .when I found a wallet and gave it to the owner  he called the police on me accusing me for stealing it.
W man
Hey good job ma boy
Some like that happen to me, I just get home and 5 mins later I hear someone front of my house yelling so when I come out I seen him with my wallet n I was confused bcs I didn’t know l had dropped it n he said yea I seen this wallet on the floor and since u were kinda close I drove over here to give it to u. I was shocked fs

glad it was  not a black boy found it!
Good dude. Little bro needs to stand up straight tho. Have some pride in your good deeds 🦸🏾‍♂️
Love love love! His momma taught him right.
That’s just incredible 🥺❤️
💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Right on brother.
If that was my kid, I'd live off this story for the rest of my life
This is how you raise someone right 💓
So good deed😊😊💞💞👍💓💓
I’m sure his ethics will get him somewhere really good in this life
What a lovely kid. He’s mumma raised him right. ❤
That was so refreshing to see. Pls parents, help raise good kids in this world. ❤️
I love this! His mama must be proud
He did it cuz she was a baddie 😤
The world needs more young men with character like this.
I’m glad this story had a happy ending for the young man. We all know that the times we live in he could have been killed trying to do a kind act. I wish he had just turned the purse over to the store manager instead.
That kids parents raised him right
I love this kid and I love this story. There IS hope for our future...👏🏾💯❤️
Bless that sings, it's blessings 10-fold. Happens to me in similar situations in Walmart Chino Hills. A purse left in shopping cart then hand it to store manager and forget all abt it.
Great kid
GOD Bless this boy 🙏
Awesome story!
Beautiful
Thank you man for bringing her purse to her and doing what's right. Amazing job 👏
Take Lil homie on a date,,,
For me this is normal behavior. On what ghetto do you all live?
Yes!! I don't know him, but I'm very proud of him. That's a guy with integrity, did the right thing even if no one's looking. He deserves the good karma and ofc the reward!
More parents need to teach their children like how this young man parents did.
Goog job kidoe
That kid is a thug
Lovely 🥰
Great story.
There’s still good in the world
Great story
Needed this story. Good for him.
Be the change you want to see in the world. I've done this three times with purses and once with car keys - it's a nice feeling getting things back home. I hate the bit where you have to open up a purse and go looking for an address, but it's necessary of course.
He definitely smashed both of them after 😏😏😏
Still good ppl left in this world..good young man, kudos to him!
5 ps5
Definitely thank the young man's parents for raising him right.  Some may think he has a "cholo" look, but he has a good heart.
amazing kindness ❤
All staged and fake. If you believe this story is genuine you’re extremely gullible.
What a great gentleman your mom taught you so right what comes around definitely will go around!! Not only that your such a good looking guy too!! You can't rescue my purse any time and return it to me!!
he did it after he seen that girls lips hopin itd be somethin more than a 3k reward
You will definitely go a long way in life with that character.  Good on you.
Kindness is beautiful
I salute this brotha
It pays to be a good boy!
I'm so proud of him 👍
3 BANDS⁉️⁉️⁉️
fantastic
Totally awesome!!!!
Must be a good life when you don't even know when you lost your personal items until someone returns it to you 🤣
We should be more like this guy!!
I Love Mi Raza 🇲🇽💯💙
And he’s fineeee. That’s a woman’s dream boy right there
My type of lad..
Good man with solid moral foundation, mom raised him right 🙌
My boy saw her id and he had to shoot his shot
Oh ya his mom, I bet read the Bible, do good to others in private, God already knows what you need 😉 bless him 🙏and his mom
Doing the right thing use to be part of the american tradition; still is for some.
May GOD Bless this young man always.  It's refreshing to hear of a young person doing what is right.  Now days you see young people breaking the law ir shooting each other.  We need more young people like him.
How beautiful.. this is rare!.
We need more people like him!
Based
This world needs more people like this young man right here. My god bless you young man 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽.
No lie I probably would have taken everything
Sturdy young dude . Both those women look good as well… well played brotha well played.
Respect
Good deed day, 😊
he deserves a motorboat too
May god bless this young man and his future and shout out to mom for raising an honest young man!❤️
I would return a purse in a heartbeat. I found a check book and found the owner.  I didn't ask for a reward, the reward is their faces of relief and happiness.
Lol and here I am returning a wallet full of money (idk how much, I just saw it because I had to open it to look for an ID)  and I didn't even get a thank you lol. Snatch from my hand, slam the door in my face 😒
I was like”what? What do you mean there’s hope for our our future generations, there always was.” But then I understood that she was talking about the country that allows guns but not kinder bueno eggs.
That young man's mother raised him well! And it was so sweet that those people raised so much for him!
What a joy to read about the love and generosity that was given to this young man for his integrity Kindness May all of the people who care thank you for letting me know this kind of humanity exists God Bless 🙏💖
Wow,  what a sweetheart he is to do that.  So many would'nt. 👍💜🎶
I don't know...something seems...fake
What a joy to read about the love and generosity that was given to this young man for his integrity Kindness May all of the people who care thank you for letting me know there is this kind of humanity exists God Bless 🙏💖
Stand up.
Well taught gentleman now.
Take note criminals
Dang Faze Rug looked different in highschool
Best story I’ve heard this morning. Peace love and success Adrian R.
It speaks a lot about him but also a lot about these girls receiving the purse & wanting to reward a good deed. Mad props
Hes a gang boy. Bad boy. Jail time
Shorty kinda bad I woulda returned it too
Wonderful young man blessings to you
Oh what a joy that this act brought about so much love and kindness Thank you to all the people who did this God Bless
Not all heroes wear capes’ some of them rockin fitted cap and looks like just wanted to skate or chill.. Godbless this young man
mexicanas
he mad cute ngl
God bless him!!
He's also handsome.  We need more kind  ppl like him around.
Amen, thank You Lord there is still good out there.  Bless that teen Lord! So happy for you all. ❤️
So proud of you young man.
Professionals have standards
I may make some extra cash by stealing people's wallets and purses and then returning them back . Maybe it will be paid off soon
Well I have to say thank you Mom for bringing up such a good Son be nice it's a world was like this
That's what's up now that's young man has respect😇💖👍
What a man, the world needs more like him 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Well God bless him ..you don't find too many of them🙏
With this little bit of act of kindness I do have faith in the human race to actually change for the better all it takes is just one small single step to get started.
I remember I left my purse in a cart at Target with over $900 cash in it, someone turned it in with the cash 🙌🏽
Me personally I was not giving that back but the purse was going to the pawnshop
Great Job Kid God Bless. You defied that no good deed goes unpunished Great job in kudos to your parents keep that mentality and you will always be okay
Congratulations to this young man's mother! She has raised A fine young man. I pray that God will bless you and keep you safe and sound at all times. Thank you for sharing this, I needed to hear something good today.😇👍
There is hope and it’s up to us to instill these values …
Great job young man 👏
His parents should be rewarded too, they’ve raised a great lad
Respect!!! 🤗
Sounds like the movie greta 💀
Good kids🌹
Nice..
God bless the young man and his family and the people who contributed to the GoFundMe page.
Milf hunter
Don't judge a book by its cover!
Sadly a lot of younger and even older folk don’t have integrity
Some damn good parenting going on there.
I will teach my future kids the same ♥️🙏🏾 See he got blessed that was God prob not the first time he did something like this.
👍👍💪💪💪 Don’t  judge  the book by the cover
Goes to show, that good manners start at home. His mom taught him well and they both should be proud of how this young man is acting; shows there is hope for our future.
We need more like him ..
FYI this person come from a Single parent household he only has his mom
I will never judge someone who dresses like that again.
He saw the woman’s ID I know what he wanted as a reward
Sheeeeeesh can eny old lady's looz thare pers soo I can return it ans get paid too???
Good kid!
My parents always said, A true hero is someone who does something good when nobody is watching. That young lad could teach a few things to some people. 😊 🏆
Ya wont see a young gurl do that 🤔
Finally, there is hope for humanity!
This is normal behaviour
Thank you for taking the purse to the owner. Honesty is always the best policy.
Yass! Glad to see my ppl doing the right thing. Good for you Adrian!!!🙏🏽
I still don’t believe there’s hope for the gen z’s. They can’t even read analog clocks.
He is a good man
So wholesome
He was hoping to be lucky in bed😁😁😁 well good on him.
This is so sweet.  He didn’t expect anything, but how nice people want to reward his kindness.
I love this. We need more people like this!
Great kid/real man!!!💖👍
Can’t believe that someone doing something good and being good is so rare it was worthy of being on the news
Finally,  some good news.  Such a great person. I did the same with a neighbor. He lost his keys, and I kept looking for the owner, I went out of my way because I thought,  if I lost my keys,  I want someone to find them and return them to me,  good karma. My neighbor was so grateful, he told me some of the keys would cost him more than $400 us to replace.  I felt so good about myself. I made his day, and that made mine.
I found a purse at the mall in the phone booth and the lady was very nasty to me when I returned it to her home.😎
The Young man deserves it! Need more of them in this world.
1 in every 15 states. Thats how rare that guy is.
He saw the license and saw she was a milf 🥴
He just became a legend & don’t even realize it. My kind of friend.
Dont judge a book by its cover 😎
Good man!  You certainly can't judge a book by its cover!
We need more kids like this.
Big news because he wasn't white and dressed up like a gang banger.  Racism of low expectations
🥰🥰🥰, that is awesome young man
such a sweetheart❤️
i love stories like this
raised by a good momma
Goodwill to this good sir
I like how this video shows a good deed and there's already arguments in the comments lol.
An act of kindness that is common in other countries is praised so heavily in America. This shows how bad America is, this should be thought to everyone since young by their parents
🙂❤ Only GOD
Wonder if he found it, bragged to his parents and they yelled at him to return it. Lol
His parents should be proud.
If Joe comes to Trump and return stolen 2020 election then I will give him $6k
there is no hope for America till you put lives before guns and give women their rights back.
Yep! God Bless!  (That’s how I was raised.. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.. as the Bible says)
I found a bank cash envelope with $800 and a withdraw slip.  I took it back to the bank and returned it. The man made a withdrawal for oxygen . He called me to thank me after the bank gave him my information....Years later after he had passed his daughter calls me up asking who I am and how much I owed her dad, my name and number were in his bookkeeping pad. Moral of the story here is not all good deeds go noticed.
such a good young boy. I always try to do acts just like him when i can  around ten years ago my dad and I were at one of my brothers lacross games we found a wallet on the ground that had around 1 thousand dollars in cash in it. This was in the poorist part of our town where 90 percent of the cities latino/latina population lived. we eventually found the rightful owner because his ID was in it (he was a US citizen) and we made sure that we gave it to the righty person and he was super happy and cried of happiness with his family. they sent us a super delicious home made dinner a few weeks later
He deserves all that money
Man kann auch alles übertreiben
There's not too many of these people left might as well enjoy them Good boy
Seems like a happy ending, but when I was a teenager, I’d be pretty upset if I found out a video of me was being widely shared without my permission.
My ex-wife daughter would love to get some schooling about honesty from this young man..
Good young man. Need more just like him
He was raised right. God bless him.
W lady
Good dude
His mother should be proud !!! What a good kid.
Nice
outstanding!! he deserves the recognition!!
This just shows that if you do something nice for somebody then you will be offered an reward for your kindness.
Your an exemple young man 💛🧡❤ Your parents must be proud of you
Loved watching this
This young man gives me faith and hope for humanity, maybe we'll get it right yet. Be kind.
Good work young man, much respect to you and that god heart of yours
bless that man, a true man !!
💗🙏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 whay a wonderful young man!
I wish someone returned my wallet like him,I lost my passport, driving licence, health insurance card and money😥
What that younger guy did is a true opposite in ekasi
He could have just turned it  to customer service  that's all. He did it for  views or cash price..cmon
Finally someone gave a good samaritan a nice reward instead of just giving him a pat on the back and a thumbs up.
Great kid. Hold your head up high mate
Well raised by parents. Good job! 👍
Your a good man Adrian Rodriguez 👏
That's exactly is what defines a good person. Doing good just so because its the right thing to do.
I cant believe there's so many people out there that fall for this act. It's nothing more than a sly fundraiser for the two ladies and their friend.
Don't believe everything you see
That's her cousin brah stop
I would've taken the money as a finders fee before giving it back
Wow Thts very surprising cuz you can tell he’s a G or got a gangsta family or there wasn’t enough money in there for him 😂
Great job!!!!
Wonder what the result would be if it was some biggo chick on the i.d.
This guy make my day 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
ahhhh finally some great news from the young ppl too. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 This energy is missing in America!
I really hope he gets that money
What a wonderful young Man, bless him and his Mother, for doing such a great job raising her son.🙏🙏🙏🙏😇😇
The key words in all of this " my mom's told me to do the right thing EVEN WHEN NOBODY'S WATCHING" the character of this young man can't be taught. Good job mom!!!!
His Mom must be so proud right now
Do the right thing even when no one’s looking 👌🏾
Respect ✊
This is why you don't judge a book by its cover.   The guy looks a bit gangster, BUT hes actually really sweet and nice.
The person looks like a Gucci bag purse. Worth 5000 so $3000 reward is very nice
Good job and God bless!
I returned a credit card that I found in the pharmacy pick up window at CVS.. no reward but I still feel good about doing it.  I would want someone to do that for me..
Waoooo
Nice young man, a credit to his family
Nice young man with morals there glad his mom taught him something valuable and glad he felt that way I would always wish for someone to return my things as well never happens, but glad this one played out that way... still some good in us (humans)
Thank you for sharing some good news!
Alright but If this was a set up and he walked away with it .. what would be your first thought “ he taking it home “ in reality he was going to take it to the owners house . No one would believe him …
If anyone loses a purse, tell me. I need the money. Please
😎 🆒️
Kids a rare breed in a world like this. I say the same thing, I wouldn't want someone taking my stuff. Good job sir! 👏
That’s a nice reward 😂
This is so rare! This young man might have a rough exterior, but he has a heart of gold! 💛👏
Thank you god
Good job, young man 😊
It always comes down to the upbringing. He has amazing parents
He has restored the faith in humanity 🙏
💖💖
good news good guy many blessings to him and his fam
I've done this a few times. Once I returned a wallet with over $600 in it. I'll never forget, the older woman cried- it was all the money she had (on her way to see a doctor.)  On another occasion, believe it or not, I almost got in big trouble. A great tip is to NEVER, ever touch property that is not yours. Wait nearby and call the police- let them touch it. Once you touch it- you can absolutely be charged. Sad but very, very true.  It's also sad that in 2022, they have to make videos about 1 out of 100 people doing the right thing. Doing the right thing should be the norm.
Don’t let looks deceive you. I’ll be honest he didn’t look like the type of person to return it.
More people like him and more people the woman pls
I once returned a man’s wallet with all his cards and ID plus a 100 dollar bill that my friends wanted to take (but I didn’t let them) Had to find him on Facebook. He asked if he could get me Jamba Juice or something in return and I said it was fine. But after seeing what Adrian got, a gofund me doesn’t sound too bad 😂 I was around 18 or 19 at the time
Good thing he didn't get beat up and blamed for missing items. It happens, that's why this guy deserves alot. He did the right thing that most people wouldn't do because sometimes doing the right thing gets you in trouble if you ended up with the wrong kind of the receiving end.
handsome and respectful. the best mixture a man could be🫢
Lets keep this positivity going, the world needs it. Thanks Adrian
Quit playing he seen the baddie on the id he tryna slide on at
You better give a free ukk what
GOD bless him! And his momma for raising and honorable young man. Let's have more of this 🙏 the world needs it ❤
I’m so very proud of that young man and for doing the right thing! 😉👍🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Good guy 👌🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
this is a good example of dont judge a book by its cover
Long time ago I found  a wallet full of money I returned to right full owner in return I get the middle finger 🖕for doing the right thing
This makes me so happy. Alot of ppl would look at him and assume hes a bad guy. This teaches ppl not to judge a book by its cover cause this young man is the type of man that should be teaching other young men how to behave. Honest and empathic.
Good boy, God bless him.
Good to see a MALE GENDER doing the right thing. Hopefully other males follow his example.
I hope one day when I have kids I’m able to raise them as good as his parents raised him. I hope God blesses him, and his family. They deserve the best. 🙌🏼
There is an old saying, CHARACTER IS DOING WHAT'S RIGHT. WHEN NO ONE IS LOOKING.✨
Wow
We need so many young and old people like this young man. Thanks to the young man that listened to his mother. God bless his heart.♥️
Right On Adrian! Honest young dude, raised the right way.
Best story I have heard all month!
Sadly most people would have kept the contents. He is a rare person these days.
His mama raised him right💯❤️
RESPECT…. A LADY BROUGHT A PACKAGE 📦 THAT WAS DROPPED OFF AT HER HOUSE BY MISTAKE TO ME AND GOOD THINGS LIKE THAT REALLY STICK WITH YOU AND MAKE YOU WANNA DO THE SAME. GOOD PEOPLE VIBES 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Honesty gets a long way with good ppl
Awesome 👏🏼!  Give and it shall be given!
A lovely young lad being kind and honest if u do good karma does good for u, good on u lad its nice to see a teenager with morals ❤
Hell yeah
Sometimes I think I hate people. But I just hate the fact that everyone isn't this amazing. I love good people. ❤️
I don't know why, but just him living by his moms advise almost made me cry. 😢😄
God bless you wonderful jester on your part, so happy you were rewarded,
What a good young man! This makes me tear up.
Good man
He bad
I used to buy fishing tackle from a pawnshop in South Alabama years ago. I saw a wallet in a phone booth outside the store.I called the operator and got the phone number of the owner that lived in Florida. Called got the man's wife on the phone told her I had the wallet. 2 days later he came to my house  got his wallet and left me 50 bucks with my Mom. That was in the 70's. 65 now amazed to see some good kids still exist.
All about that foundation
MY BOYS WILL ONE DAY BE AS CARING AS THAT YOUNG MAN!! IN JESUS NAME!
Lesson of the day. Do the right thing when no one is watching!
I remember when I was a kid riding bike, someone's purse flew out of the back window, I picked up the purse and rode my bike till I chased them down and handed the lady back her purse. The look on that lady's face was pure shock, she said her baby threw it out the window,,, I am now much older and the Lord has kept and blessed me multiple times in my life,,, I gave to this young mans GoFundMe for his good deed.
Plot twist: He is a thief and gave the purse back because he felt guilty.
I would of took the 3k
Here's a young man that was raised RIGHT! 👍
I found a wallet one time in the middle of the road, found the girl who it belonged to on Facebook, met up and was accused of stealing it and asked where her money was inside it. You definitely gotta still be careful when you come across someone’s wallet or purse. Next time, I’m likely to just leave it and continue on my way.
This is awesome! Glad he was rewarded for his kindness! 🖤  Good kid!
Always do the right thing even when no one’s looking. Words to live bye
Bless you heart young man.  We need more people like you in this world. Your integrity will bring you blessings. ❤️
YESSS!!!!! REAL MAN !!!!AND THE MOM  IS DOING MORE THEN GREAT !!!!👏👏👏👏👏 HES 17 AND ALREADY MAKING PPL FEEL HOPEFUL!!!!!!👏👏👏👏
Awesome Adrian ! Sp proud of you for doing the right thing!
I love it! What a great kid. And kind people for rewarding him! Ahh what a refreshing news story,
stupid kid i would steal the purse
How come this not a Prank? We been hearing about guns all this year
good job,  foo. He walked his Cortez Nikes to do a good job.
Such a beautiful and honest young man.. may God bless your heart
bare minimum lol but yess adrian!! he’s a good person and would treat a women right !! :)).
people (including me) would be too lazy to go out of their way to return it
That’s a true ninja
Fair play plot twist we also let him tap us both it was the least we could do 😂
BRAVO, Adrian!! 👏👏👏😊
That was very nice of him. It was good they gave him a reward. But even if they did not it would have been cool. The fact that he went out of his way to return the purse speaks volumes about his character.
Good kid.
Keep that as in example a lot of people judges by the way we dress of because he dress certain way they think we bad people or gangsters don’t judge a book by it’s cover and this is the example good job youngsta mother raised you right
Much respect for this young man shows can’t judge a book by its cover
Nice!! Great young man 👏👍
This happened to me 2 times. I lost my wallet twice and someone returned it
That's wassup, good dude.
So, did the boy actually ever receive the reward money?
Plot twist: He actually stole the purse, and stole some  money from the wallet. Then felt guilty and returned the purse pretending that he found it.
Thats pretty awesome! If the guy had been black that wouldn't have happened sadly.  . 🤭🤣
Glad this young man has been recognized for his good behaviour.
Karma can be your best friend or worst enemy.
Proof that good karma is real
🙌🙌
I have found a cell phone in the snow as an adult and a wallet when I was a kid. I returned both items to their owners and all I got was anger. The wallet was missing whatever money was in it when I found it so they guy thought I took it and I had to go into the phone to try to find a phone number to return the phone which is the ONLY thing I looked at so the guy was kinda mad I went into the phone. Not everyone is as lucky as this kid but I’m glad he was rewarded. I teach my kids the same thing as this kid’s parents “it doesn’t matter if you can get away with doing something, you know in your heart if it’s right or wrong so always do the right thing”
This is a true good deed, when no one is watching. He did not pull out his cellphone to record himself returning the purse. Nowadays people will not rescue a pet or help the homeless without a video of it. Amazing young man
Aw:s yea ses
What a good boy his mama raised❤️
Good job kid.
Great young man 🥰
❤
Good job my boy! Now that’s a real gangsta
That boy pants were about to fall down lmao
Never judge a book by its cover!!
✨💞💯
Raised right, good things for your future. Good job young man!
Yes he is a unicorn and trust me there is no hope for the younger generation
What a gentleman. So glad to hear this.
Hopefully the donation will encourage other youngsters to always be honest And do what’s right.. you never know the rewards or outcomes..  God bless this young guy and Bless his good parents.. 👏👌
Sad part is this stuff gets glorified now. Don’t get me wrong it’s much better than glorifying violence or drugs or other stuff, but This should be normal, it used to be normal. It just shows how far back we’re moving when simple good deeds make the news. Kudos to the young man regardless.
🙋Thank U sir💖
Just because one kid did good don't change the fact the world will always be corrupt and there is no hope for our people and the planet
Rare, but what a great guy
What a righteous young boy! God has and will continue to bless him in an abundance
Good job young man!!!
Bravo mom and son. There is hope yet.
God bless this young man for doing the right thing and the people who rewarded him.
I love happy endings 🥰
Blessed!
Now you'll girls who want to find a good man, then he  really qualify for that 😂👊🏾

Chivalry aint dead and comes in different flavors
very good kid indeed!! ❤️
Someone raised a great young man!!!
Bless him, and his parent.   The story made me cry from joy.  It matters a lot what it has been preached from birth.  My mother always said,  “kids might seem not listening, but they do”   Repeat, repeat, consistently, and will sink in.  Love
Really good, stand up guy right there!
So touching. Real b8g American politicians n people can learn a thing or 2 from minorities Asians Hispanic people
🪳

He must have fantastic parents!! My big hug to his mom and dad for raising him so welll
Awesome dude! 💪🤜🤛🙏🖖
Great kid! Raised by good parents. I have students just like him. I teach high school. When we praise teens and talk to them with love and care….they do the right thing. Good job!
This day and age bro should have the police meet him at the owners house for the exchange. Just sayin
The go fund me is up to $5,000!
How is this news, america moment
me hace feliz esto❤️
Blessings to this young man and his mother for teaching him well!
✝️💜
Now that is a awesome young man! He was raised right.
We need more gangsters who return things to owners
A true good Samaritan would decline the reward.
Very good young man. Honesty is such a rare trait nowadays.
Good for him. That is amazing and that is what I was taught and what I taught my children
It’s not HARD to do the RIGHT thing
i remember back when i was still in college, a guy left his wallet in the food court. i drove 20 miles to his house to return his wallet. he was so dumbfounded cuz he didn't even realize it was gone. needless to say i wasn't rewarded, but it just goes to show doing the right thing is just right. :)
Racist they gave it to him out of pity tsk tsk tsk
$ 3.785 = 3k. Thanks for this lesson.
I'm literally in tears
He saw her picture on the id and thought, “I’ll just take it to her house” . Boy was attempting to creeep and got $3k! 😎🤪😝
Come on this kid returns a woman’s purse and gets 3K I returned some candy to a weird van and butt stuff happened’s life’s unfair man
Good man 🦸‍♂️
God bless the young man for returning the woman's purse.
He’s parents did a fantastic job raising an amazing son👍🏻🐨🇦🇺
It's only surprising cause he looks like he would steal it.
Our hope for the future generation.
No, our youth is still F'd. This is a rarity. Good for him.
Amazing 🤩 My kid would do that too.
Haha! He did it because he thought she’s fine as beep, and was hoping for another kind of reward 😄🙌🏻
Now that's a great man right there! Sometimes we get stressed out, and I guarantee SHE WAS stressed to the max to forget her purse. Good on you young blood, you fill me with hope and pride 💜💜💜💜
This just makes my day something amazing that happened
Why don't actions like these go viral? Kudos to that kid and the ladies for rewarding him!! I bet this happens more often than we think, but remains anonymous...may God bless them all :)
His mom should be proud 🥹
I think it says something about current society when somebody doing the right thing is an anomaly
he got that superwog outfit
Good job, and well rewarned!!!! Most gesture like this. Win win
Almost 4 thousand mashallah. And he didn't do it to post on social media-butout of pure goodness.
He’s fine
More folks need to raise their kids this way. We need  more young men like this.
Great Story.........there is Hope fir this World.
I wish this would’ve happened to me when I dropped my lv purse in my own apt complex after getting out my car, never saw it again. My own neighbors couldn’t be considerate so kudos to this young man 👏🏾
Respect
Remember this young man's image, and when you see someone who looks like him, smile and show respect.
Sod the three grand, looking at them two, a three sum would be a far more nicer experience and lasting memories. Money comes and goes.
What an Angel, he was raised the right way....
Nice boy but dresses up like a gangster
Hope he buys a belt now.
Respect 🙏. Good on him .Good man.
Thank goodness there is still hope for our youth!
+$3000 EZ Clap. Cuz if you return it youll maybe get a reward and you wont feel guilty :D
Well raised  young man!
The fact that this is a shocking occurrence shows the state of our planet these days. Kudos to the guy for doing the right thing 👏
He is awesome 👌
Rewards >
Parenting matters
This just screams America
Good guy
I would've asked for a date with Eliana, yowzah!
Imagine everyone in the world like this.
This kid has morals and a conscience.  Which is severely lacking in people today.
I LOVE it. He listened to his mommas words of Wisdom and followed through with it.  My mother had her purse stolen and it took forever to get all her stuff back. It was like 20 some years ago so things weren't as tech savvy!  I hope this Smart Young Man stays on the right track   I  believe he will!!!
I did dis in 2018. I found a purse with everything in it Id credit card social security money ect. I return it back to her apartment same night. And I wasn't even working at time no job. And I didn't even get nothing.
GOD BLESSED the young Man his mom thought him very great manors.!?
This brings me hope ❤️
She sounds abit like cardi b
We need more people like that
bless him
Blessings to this young man’s family
If they don't give that brave young man some ChonChon
I left my iphone 11 pro max in a busy foodcourt just this last weekend. The moment I noticed, I know it’s already a lost cause that’s why I was shockingly surprised when the Lost and Found dept of the mall handed it back. I am not even sure that I left if there cause I thought it might have been a pickpocket. I was so insanely lucky and can’t believe to have my phone returned when it’s crazy impossible nowadays. I gave small reward to the mall staff who kindly returned it because such honesty is so rare nowadays like it happens in Japan but not here! My phone telco plan is also ending in 2 months and I don’t want to get another phone in like 3-5yrs so thank god.
Seriously as a Mom of boys, THIS IS THE STANDARD OF HUMANITY to teach young men to have. Hats off to you young man, you have my respect, Sir.
❤️❤️❤️
He truly is a celestial Angel.
Amen
Get that number too!
I remember I lost my purse in front of the mall parking lot. It had my cell phone, bill money, and ID. I was searching all night for it and tracked my cell phone and found out it was in a pickup truck. But no one was inside the vehicle and the mall was closed. Till the next day I did a emergency call button for my cell phone and to my surprise a retailer woman picked up and explained to me a man dropped off my purse in a beauty department. I drove to pick up my purse. It had my cell phone and ID but no money. I was devastated, because it wasn’t luxury money but bill money for electricity, gas and rent. That my family had to pitch in to help me that day.
Your aunt didn’t know she lost her purse?
Awesome young man and all who gave $$
i have no idea who he is but I’m seriously so proud, one small act could lead to so much kindness 🥺
this reminds me of a movie called Greta
It’s good to see someone returning the purse instead of stealing from it
Finally we get to hear good news because in TV all you hear is nothing but death and negative stuff the world still has some good in it
Lovely story
For those bringing up his race why do you feel race is apart of this? Good deeds dont discriminate. Wither black white aisan Mexican Spanish Jewish Christian everyone is capable of doing the right thing!
It's a shame that this is surprising
Well done lad well done you good person 🇬🇧 xx 👏
MAN THESE COMMENTS HAVE ME did y’all not see the ID he straight said AYO!😻 but he a good man 🤣😭
Good kids out there still good job 👍
What a great young man there still hope for our youth, Great job
Lead by example...
Nah they becoming 🏳️‍🌈 sadly so no hope
Around of applause 👏
update: The reward is currently at 7.6k
Maybe with the 3k he can invest in a belt
What a good kid! Wow! Outstanding.
Thats awsome ,I love the fact you went out of your way to find him and its been a big deal that he did the right thing and I'm assuming he got above and beyond what cash was in the purse. We usually only hear about bad acts people  do .This was good thank you for sharing, And May God Bless You All.
it's around 7k now, keep it coming <3
Bruh it’s just a purse why is he getting 3k and is on the news 💀
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼NoW 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼  👉🏽 ThatS what's up 👈🏽  ShaloM 🕊️🍃
This is so fake! Those women do porn and when found out the guy was young they paid him for finding there purse...
He know that a huge reward is loading than the money in purse😂🤣
I woulda looted that shi💀💀
His mother raised him right.good job mom
We need a lot more people like him. He is blessed
The real story here is that this is a story. I'm sorry to be a stone in the shoe, but... It's a problem that this isn't the norm anymore. I moved last year from a capital city to a small town, and the culture shock of not having to watch over my belongings anymore is still not entirely settled in. I lock my front door only because I discovered that it's so old that if I don't, I'll return home to a wide open door. No one steals or rips my bikes. I'm old enough to remember it being this way, even in a smaller city, but honesty is gone now most places. I'm 45. Interestingly, if you travel to Japan, you'll find the same honesty and community awareness, even in a mega city like Tokyo, so it's not scale. We're doing something wrong. I'm glad this boy was brought up well, and I hope his parents aren't proud, just "of course he did, he's not a criminal," and that the purse owner and her friend invited him in for cookies and a hug. Let's make this world better, I don't know why it's going so bad 😔
There’s hope but not much of it
Honor
I checked again and the GoFundMe's at $7,500!
He was trying to beat..
Good on him
God bless the boy he need a chance in life with his great morals mom gave him best of the best in life soldier continue and show what a Man should grow up to be like 👍🙌🏾👏
What an amazing and wonderful guy!!!!! In these horrible times in this country, we need more stories like this one!!!!!
Kind young man...❤💯
W boys
Goodness spreads ! Even the smallest gestures or acts of kindness can change a person’s world !
Foundation is very important in life
He was just hoping for some exotic tilapia..
The definition of integrity
Wonderful, honest young man.❤❤
Excellent parenting !!!👏👏👏
amazing
One thing about men is that when raised right, they’re mothers words will stay with them their entire life.
Young man ya did an outstanding job !!! Your momma raised a real man !!
Being straight forwards pays more on so many levels.. 👌🏾💯
What a cutie 😭💙
what is the legal status of these people??
His mom told him good so super thank you
God bless this young man.  May he get millions more through out his life !
Right here folks, don’t judge a book by its cover……good karma coming his way…
Never judge a book by its cover
He better get paid for inside edition video too.
I love this story
Thats rare in America but common in Korea
What a normal human should do. Good on him.
Why can’t the world be like this and he could of been like any a$$kid and just took it and he didn’t that’s exactly why I teach my kids right from wrong
Aww that's kind 🥰
He was trying so smash on the low!
Good kid 💪
well done! my mom told me exactly the same since i was little and i still do it, because at the end of the day you know you did the right thing.
This story made my day!!
Nice, both the return and the reward!
Great example of a role model this teaches the younger generation and all of us how to be kind in many different ways 🤍
I love to hear stories like this.
Bro looking like a breaking bad character 💀
Could be he stole it and decided he was going to get caught (cold feet), so risked returning it and turning the tables on them. Believe me, I used to steal things at his age.
This report should be aired nationally!
This is the kind of kid you wouldn’t mind dating your daughter
This would not seem so strange in the UK. It only seems strange when you don't expect it.
💕💕💕
🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Fine young man!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Good kid
0:22 all that plastic surgery just to smile like the grinch (the aunt) 😂😂😂  Good deed though by a young man that was raised with morals and respect for others stuff 👌🏽
wow finally a video about america not about guns
In the dark ages of earth we need something like this...its a rare thing to see these days...he owe me 5 bucks
Well done that young man, hats off to you 👏 👍
Beautiful. Great young man. Great Job to his mother. Well done.
What a great young man. The world needs more people like you my young brother. Right on ! 🙏 4 🌍 ✌️ ❤️
I once returned a couple of lost phones and wallets and few years later someone returned my lost phone and ID.  Good deeds do come back on you...
Who cares ,..
His parents did right. An he did right by them if he was my kid I'd be so proud, doing the right thing without expecting anything in return. We need more people like this in the world their to much of people expecting to get a reward in this world to do good deeds an that's not what it should be about.
This story is so awesome.
*Very rare in america!*
Everyone gangsta until the gangsta is honest.
Funny won't find this nice story on CNN.
This happened to my mom!! She Lost her wallet and shortly after she got home she got a knock on the door and it was a teenager and his mom. The kid found her wallet and told his mom so they brought it over to my moms house! My mom gave him the cash she had in her wallet.
Shout out to the parents fr fr when you do good things to someone GOOD THINGS COME BACK to YOU💯💜
Imagine being happy for normal behaviour..😬 why you guys praising him in comments?? That’s what everyone should do! What would you expect? Stealing it? You guys psychopath.
Meanwhile my brother lost his wallet almost 3 weeks ago. Still no return smh
💯
And how quickly he would be profiled by the police despite the fact that he is an amazing soul.
His parents must be proud!
Thank you for sharing this experience!    Yes, we still have good youth!
Young boy wanted parts!!!! 😂😂😂 I’d take the reward than blaze both of em! With their smiling asses
I love to hear stories like this ❤
Wow God Bless
Congratulations and appreciation for Parents for Raising a good human.
Waiting for this to happened to me
will they give him $1000 and take the 6k for themselves?
Highly honorable. Salutre
Another prime example on not to judge the book from its cover. You look at him on the street and you think he’s a thug or a trouble maker, but the truth is he’s just an honest and genuine person.
It would be cool to have heard from his Mom, much credit to her for raising a sweet son with integrity.
I would never dare take anything from a lost purse or wallet before returning it.
The real question is, was there even anything valuable in the purse
Such a good person , he was raised right . I'm glad he got a reward for doing the right thing 👍 there still is sum good people in this world 🌍
His mother taught him well
Good Samaritan/ Gang Member
Gotta love our Hispanic community’s everyone helps everyone
Good human
his mama gonna be so proud x
This kid is the future!
Turn it in to the police instead guys.. I've heard a similar story of a guy getting sued for doing something similar because the owner of the item tried to twist the story saying the good Samaritan stole it to begin with.
Proud to say I’ve gone out of my way like this before
Gentleman 👍
Integrity
I liked it🔥🔥🔥🥷
what a good kid
Right on brother perfect example bout how a man should carry himself in the situation
He seen the ID and said damn I gotta try and hit that 😎
Kudos to His parent
I so wish the best for this young man.  What goes around comes around.  He'll never regret his actions.  Salute!
Something a little hinky about her purse only having her FRIEND'S ID in it... Does she not have a driver's licence and is using her friend's to trick police? Why even include such a confusing explanation?
They raised him well
💜💜💜 such a sweet story
This dude definition of a pimp got the chains and the Audi and still be returning everthing.
His family must be so proud.
Well done young man!
Blessings on you both. I love the transparent honesty of this young man.
And thanks to is mom he listings i love story like this amazing
See what can happen when you do the right thing. This young man is now blessed with some well needed funds that he can use to live.
What a wonderful young man! 💜
This is awesome! It makes me smile to see such an honest gentleman. Many blessings to this young man. 🙏🏽❤️
S/o to his mom showing this young man good morals
One in several million.
He has a car, he probably is better tham the woman herself, i wanna see someone in real need to do the same thing.
Not that I was looking for a reward or anything - but I was once in a mall and this dude dropped his wallet without realizing it. The dude was LOADED! Hundred-dollar bills were falling out on the floor. I didn't hesitate - I scooped up his wallet and shoved every last bill into his wallet without counting it - rushed to the man's side and have him his wallet. He never said so much as "thanks". He just grabbed his wallet and moved on. A Thank you would have been all the reward I would have expected. But nope. Since then I lost my wallet twice over the years and each time someone held the wallet for me - and I am not loaded with money by any stretch of the imagination, but I always thanked the person and praised them for being such honest persons. YES - I will still do the right thing should I find a purse or wallet. I don't want the money. A thank you is great. If I don't get that thank you? Well - I did what was right and I can live with myself even without the thank you.
I love this story!!!
Wow… currently the go fund me is at over 7,000 dollars!
Mom taught him well
Hey that’s my name😌
Hello this a beautiful story what a great guy and awesome me i will do the same thing because i was raised well by my wonderful mother and I'm glad you had your purse back what a great hero that young guy Godbless him each day
Maybe if I do something like this for somebody, I could get a big reward too 😏
W
Salute..
I bet he didn’t spend that money like other teenagers would.
There is actually hope for the new Generation 😭😭
Whoever his mom is did a great ass job. He was raised right 💯💯
Like the saying says “ everything starts at home” this mommas boy taught him well. Do good and good things come back to you.
What a great kid! His future looks bright and I wish him the best that life has to offer.
Thats good very good
Someone did this for me once. Hugely grateful to get everything back, she actually handed it in to a police station. Unfortunately they said they couldn’t tell me who she was so I was never able to thank her. But I’ve always handed in things I’ve found and I think that was karma thanking me!
Very nice
What shocked people but won’t admit to it is the fact the kid is black
okay, so this is a good story and all and a feel-good moment of what we should do.  is there a possibility that his mom thought he stole the purse didn't believe him and gave him the alternative of returning it or having the police called?  I know the is judging but I can't be the only one that thought that. I mean as a kid I would of def went through the purse as curiosity. sadly, my mind goes right to this scenario and no disrespect to him it's just with so much negativity in the world and violence, crime my automatic thinking always goes to the worst.  please don't hate!!!  I hope this story is true, it would show what a true individual should do he does look like a nice kid and I wish the best for him.  I just wish my automatic thought didn't jump to another theory.
This really made me cry  he did the right thing bless him
There is hope for this generation yet 🙂 keep up the good work my dude 😎
Nice still hope for humanity 🙏.
Cast your bread upon the waters and it will return press down shaken together and running over. You reap what you sow. So a garden of honesty and goodness. Reap a garden of faithfulness and value in your own life
God blessed that young man. Respect brother.
Waoooo
I love ❤ this young man. He embodies the character we should all have!!
Nice kid. He gave credit to his mom how he was raised. It shows this younger generation could be better off if their parents instilled good morals in them. This kid was raised by a good mother. Good for everyone.🙂👍
For some reason this touched me so much I have tears in my eyes. Good to see somebody is doing it right. Yahuah bless you. Awesome young man
Just shows you the results of good parenting...
More news like this! More people will be inspire to do what’s right!
naw he just wanted to scope out the crib for later. 😂😂 Justin kidding. hats off to the young man for breaking barriers and stereotypes. good job ☮️
If we only had more like him!
In the world we live in, things like this go unnoticed. Props to this young man for doing the right thing and proving that there is still hope left for humanity.
That's good. I would do the same!
Heart warming!!!
I respect that how he not going to stealing the bag, he deserve the reward for what he is doing to, if majority of people do the thing like him, the world could be safe more and not a lot of problem occurs!
Bless his heart.
And then she slept with him? 👀👀👀
He is a great young man and did the right thing!
Awesome! I wish that my teenagers were a lot more like him!
Just wonderful! May GOD continue to bless this young man and his family. ❤️
Faith in the FOO community feels restored, Palabra
AMAZING KID. GREAT PARENTS
This so so great!!!! What an amazing kid!!! I’m so so glad he was rewarded!
so wholesome.
He's a prince

Kudos to him man, god will bless if you bless others.
I have found two wallets, two cell phones, and a purse, and was blessed enough to be able to return them to their rightful owners. I'm glad my mother raised me right.   i have mad respect for this young man!!! ❤❤❤
He could’ve taken anything he wanted from the purse, instead he went out of his way to return it big respect
the fact she did't egven gave him 5$ shows how much of a buitcch she is ''theres hope for our younger generation'...but I wont reward a insanely great and or important deed at all..sigh
They were his tia's
Gta mission completed call Lamar for more
This is what God blesses💕
What sweet young man.
On the real, he was just tryin to bust cheeks

Good guy +Rep
What a wonderful young man, was raised so good!!!
Parents must be proud he’s raised so well❤️
So refreshing to hear a nice story in this world of 💩 news...
Reminds me of when my daughter found a ladies purse in the bathroom. It had over 2k worth of cash and all her ids. It took alot of effort to track her down by phone but eventually we found her number. Once the lady came to pick up the bag, she didn't even get out of the car and sent her own daughter in to get the purse, so she didn't even thank her let alone give her a little reward. I felt sad for my daughter even though she wasn't sad.
The same thing happened in Ghana not long ago and he was rewarded by the vice president of the Republic of Ghana
Finally. A good kid
Update story: he snatched it himself once he saw how she look just have been very appealing to him, then proceeded to take the purse then return it to her thinking she would let him in instead he didn’t notice the friend was there.
“Fine Young Man” 😂💯
“Fine Young Man” 😂💯
“Fine Young Man” 😂💯
GREAT PEOPLE!!! YOUNG MAN, AND WOMEN!  THANK YOU ALL FOR THIS !  JUST BEAUTIFUL!!! YOUNG MAN GOD BLESS YOU
Good job Adrian you will make it far in life with that great mindset of yours
That's amazing and the fact that they thanked him for being a good person is even better I feel like now endays we need to award good people and behavior becuse there is not alot of it out there like she said he did even have to return it notice it or had even kept what was inside and he didn't he went out of his way to return it .... amazing the mom did amazing raising him
This made my day!!! A great good news story to start the day🌞☀️
So proud of this young man! 💜
17 year old me after seeing her license.. I sure as hell would return it. Lol 😘
We don't need more people like him in our country. we need to BE MORE LIKE HIM.
God will reward him. Good  young man. We need more like him. If he is greedy. Good thing will not  come good. He deserved 3000.
I have a large wallet that was given to me by my daughter's grandmother at Christmas thirty-one years ago.  I have lost it twice.  Once I left it on the counter at an airport after showing my ID to the gal behind the counter before rushing off to make my plane.  I thought I had left it on the plane and considered it lost until I received a package in the mail from the airline.  The second time was alongside of a road at night when I had stopped to remove a pebble from my shoe.  Again, I considered it lost until I received yet another package in the mail from someone who had found it.  Both times it was returned with nothing missing.
What a nice kid! His mother is doing right.
Bible
Leading By Example, Great Job Young Man!
Dimostra che ha  buoni genitori che lo hanno educato bene..nel rispetto e onesta
Yeah this don’t happen in Cali. My aunt left her purse in the cart at the target parking lot. Noticed before she was even all the way out of the parking lot and by the time she got back to hurt cart not even 5 min later her purse was gone. It’s a nice small town to.
$3k… but innumerable karma points ❤️
Hell yuh
Way to go his Mom did an Excellent Job in raising him honesty is the best policy 👍🌟👍⭐👍✨♥️
I’m in admiration of this young man. He and his parents should be really proud.
I lost count of how much stuff I returned, sadly never was captured on video lmao.
When you give the lady her purse back in GTA
Awesome young man, whose mother loved him enough to raise him right.  The world would be in  a much better state if there were more people like this.
I have been in many situations where I find other people's things and I do everything I can everytime to find their way back home. If I want something I earn it and work for it on my own. I do not want someone else's things, even money. To do good will feel better than you expected and help build your character and self respect for yourself and others around you. A little bit of good goes a long ways.
He probably stole it in the first place 😂
Integrity. Many more need it in this world
Suggestion for Melina Marquez to have a physician check the slight bulge on her neck for possible thyroid issues.
👏👏👏
He’s 17 and drives an Audi
I drive for UPS being on the street all day you find tons I returned envelopes full of cash. Wallets purses never got a reward I do it for the personal satisfaction
can we take a moment bc he’s cute
HUMANITY!! Bless You, Young Sir🌺
God bless him & all the peps that gave him a reward. Well done, young man!
Well done on both sides!
Making his momma proud 👏 the integrity this young man has is inspiring
should have take that boy for a long date
Lmao, they feel the need to use gofund.
Good young man.
Imagine a world where behaviour like this is the norm, not the exception.
Love to see this...thank you😘
This is a prime example of good parenting in action❤❤❤❤
WOW Mom gave great life lessons. But he followed though great young man
Good kid. The world 🌎 is healing again
Good young man !😊
wauw just wauw
THIS YOUNG MAN is HOPE FOR OUR FUTURE!!!!
0:24 The girl with the black hair lookin like an IG filter💀💀
"Do the right thing even when nobody's watching you" his mother is a good person who knew the power of those words n what it can do for her son, it's enough to guide a person on the right path, n these words can be adopted by everyone too. 🤗😊
Lol have u seen the movie Greta.
One good kid., proud of you!
The og gangster the dripp tho HOLY
His parents and him need a pat on the back they raised him well respect 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏👊👊👊👊👊
He did good. I am sure when his mother saw that she was so proud 🥰. It's so sad that we have to write the news about the times people behave correctly. It just keeps getting worse. Then we have little moments like this with this young man and I remember, it's not all bad. Even when we raise our kids to do right ultimately it is their decision. He chose well ❤️
I would bring it to if i saw her nice face haha
So if I grab my aunts purse, return it, make sure I’m being recorded, have my aunt start a go fund me for returning the purse, I get money from strangers? Nice! 😂               Jk the kid is awesome!
If a lot of people loved each other, the world would be a better place to live.
Of course......go fund me *eye roll*
her friend Elia Martel
All starts with family this man was raised right
Lady could've saved her friends $1000 if she'd given him $20. They felt bad that she was greedy.
Oh yes, theres so much hope !  Fake news.
💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
What a lovely young man and his mother needs praise how she has brought him up kindness always pays and what the lovely ladies did to show there thanks is priceless.
good on his parents and him🥰
My mom says the same thing,  " Haze el bien y no mires a quien "
Ms goodalways Not  Ms13
There is hope. I once left my Louis vutton bag hanging on a park chair and totally forgot about it. And my bag and everything was returned to me.  I was shocked.
from my city 🙏
One of the biggest problems in this world is Greed if we could all help each other and be like this it be a diff world
✨♥️🙏🏽💯👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Guess GTA was right
Relieved he didn't give it to the cops. It would have been handed back to the owner without cash inside!  😓
Admired him! God bless him.
If this were in philly I can guarantee u that 1. The purse would of been stolen.                   2. No one would of answered the door for a stranger day or night. 3. The money would of been gone but everything else would of been left. And 4. The woman would of been smacked for making a G.I Jane joke. 😂
Hopefully I large company will offer him a nice job.
Yeah, he wanted sum of that mama bear
Great job young man! You inspire others.
What a sweetheart!!! 🥺💚💚💚💚💚
He is the one that stole it in the first place
It's simple. Treat people how you would want to be treated
Stories like this warms the heart
This happens all the time. It’s a random event in GTA V
Nice bro 🙏🙏🙏
His mother raised him well
Love this story.  LOVE this kid!! ❤️
Beautiful. He’s a very good looking young man too. I hope he has a wonderful life. 🙏🏼
Great job young homie, deff raised the right way 🙏🙏🙏
Integrity.
Gen z still has no hope
Wholesome
Unfortunately for some reason we were unable to get an interview with the 17 year old young man. Could he be this ladies' son helping them get money on gofundme.  🤔
Wonderful
Good kid! Through the year’s I have left my purse in my basket at Walmart several times and have been very fortunate because each time it had been returned to the service desk!
Even I would not do this out of my way in the cause of people thinking I would steal it, I stay absolutely clear from trouble never really left my room for a long time I am amazed at this young man courage
Cute
It seems she didn’t even realize she lost it Maybe he saw nothing of value and thought they needed it more than him
Faith in humanity has been restored ❤️
That's how you know a young man was raised right
Good on him..
So rare! God's blessings to him!!! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽♥️🙏🏾
💗💗💗💗💗
So beautiful! Made me smile so large! Great young man! Raised by a great mom! N those ladies were just so sweet n cute! His light ignited a fire! Love it!!!
where's the gofund me link I want to send him $
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
The suspicious/cynic me would have had him place the purse on the ground and step away from the door while asking him to keep his hands out of his pockets were I could see them. 😉😆As the saying goes, hind sight is 20/20. This young man ment nor harm. Was there to do a good deed. However, this could have easily turned into another tragic story about a ruse to get the homeowner to open the door, leading to a violent home invasion/robbery. 😬 Just call me Debbie Downer 😉
I'm spreading laugh through meme and fail videos. If you don't mind passing by for some laughter
Raised well.👏🏾Nice to see stories like this young man.
good job brother... We all look a different way but we got a beautiful heart inside... Good deeds will make us a better person.. Thanks to Mom ..
This almost sounded like the plot of Greta
There is hope. Well done young man.
🥰 happy stories make for a good day. Good on him 👏 👍
I wish the media pushed positive things like this as opposed to the looney tune stuff we're always getting.
Good kid. Its nice to hear something positive.
I’m gonna go donate to him rn! he’s so nice & kind.
Good job adrian! Good job mom! Beautiful story .
awnnnn there's still mother who teach their kids right, great, great action, congrats my man, it's hard find good people today, I didn't meaning like take the purse, but some people might have seing and just ignored. Great action.
Love it🙏🏽
Action speaks louder than words !  He was taught the right way !!!!    South Australia
In todays crazy world we see/hear stories of so many teens involved in crime. So, its a breath of fresh air to see this young man do this kind of thing for someone else.
I love to read these beautiful stories! Sweet as 💯
I would have done the same. A little boy returned a bag of chips my wife left in a vending machine at the library the other day, I told her to buy him and his friend some chips for their honestly. This is exactly what the world needs. This is so beautiful.
You never know what advice will have an effect on someone. Always give good advice no matter how small a child is. When I was in 6th grade camp I was 1 of only 2 black kids there. This white dude in cowboy boots and hat pulled me to the side and began telling me about integrity and how his dad told him about doing the right thing even when nobody was looking. I didn't understand why he was telling me this, but as I became a grown man those words mean alot. Now I graduated the police academy and it definitely something I carry with me.
This is wonderful. Thank you Jesus
My future child. He was raised right! Doing gods work! 😌
♥️ ♥️ ♥️
Bro that's his car?
Cool
I think rewarding good deed specially for teenager is a great thing to do
Gee i wonder why they went to the media.
Such an awesome young man!
GTA ought to make some notes 😂
Good for this young man. Very glad to see stories like this.
Omg this is so sweet 🥹🥹🥹 May God continue to  bless him in Jesus Name  🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Doing the right thing when no one is watching is the definition of integrity.
his mom must be so proud of him
Good job dude!!
oh wow! may god bless him
Gta random event
That kid’s parents should be very proud! They have raised a good man!
He was probably thinking I’m just giving this lady’s purse back. Not thinking about being on the news/tv. Or even getting anything from his good deed. What a good person!
Don’t judge a homie by his appearance.
What A Wonderful Young Man and His Family for teaching him the Golden Rule.😊❤
why no one is talking how handsome he is xD
17 eligible to drive?
This is me when I had to go with my mom to get her hair done I found a 100 bill and searched for the person who dropped it..I got 50 dollars just for being honest
We need this guy everyday
Super Great Story
God bless this man’s soul
nobodys gonnatalk about the snake 🐍 on the front yard
Wish more good people out there existed these days people seem not care about anything even asking how someone is doing is a good deed itself this guy’s mom must be super proud 🥹  *guess I am right*
Me and the boys trying to return the lost treasure:
That’s what I’m talking about. Good job sir.
Great teen, great response for rewarded him back. Motivate and encourage kids and young people to do what is right for better world
So sweet.
That’s awesome bless this man soul ! God bless all 🙏🏻💜☀️
There is hope
I have Done this many Tine before  But didnt get 3 k dollar for that But anyways is a good deed and he is rigth always think If it was your. And karma is what I believe in I lost my phone in a forensics country and my camera in vacation and got them back
Good job. Most of the kids seeing this will only learn that good deeds lead to stacks.
Good kid
Well done to that young man. And to his mom.
Set up a college fund for this young man.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Great way to start my morning.
everyone in. the comments just do a good deed instead or saying "we need more ppl like this"
Good IS out there
Cause his mom raised him right!! Good job, momma your son is great! Our community is great!
We need more people like you Lil Man, without expecting anything. A good deed is always the right deed
I'm confused about so much cash
So proud of this young man for doing the right thing! God sure is blessing him!
Fine young man raised by parents right 😂🤣
Sweet boy. His mom was right.
He's actually the one who stole it in the first place
Its more than $7k now on GoFundMe
How for humanity.
I would’ve raised my son so nice 🤔 pitty I never had one 😭😭😭
Good for him!!!!!!!!!
That says a lot about this young man's character.  Some would look at him and think he's a gang banger because of how he dresses.  Just shows don't judge a book by its cover.   What a wonderful young man.  Don't ever change. You were a true blessing to that woman.
What a sweet kid 😭😭
*That chick got great teeth*
That foo ain’t down ankle sock activities chales
That's great
Hope
I call people like this God's children, he need to be on GMA and a big reward even, then surprise him again. This is a wonderful story.
💜💜💜
Good thing she didn’t give him a $20 and call it a day.
Nah, there is still no hope
Yea, and here i lost my passport a few months ago and one day i got a call from a guy i had just met at a pub (the place i lost my passport at). The guy said he knew the person who had found my passport and shamelessly demanded that I give him some form of compensation since he had " useful information" for me. I'm always busy with work so i told the guy to tell the other guy to drop the passport at a nearby Police station, they wouldn't do it because then they wouldn't be able to extort money from me. I don't my giving a few bucks as a token of  gratitude, but to hear someone demand it. I was speechless
Will Fox News or CNN show this? 🤔
“There’s hope for our younger generation “ girl what😭😭
Hopefully he uses that money to buy some proper fitting clothes 😁
A wonderful display of virtue! This young man was very kind to bring back the purse, he should be proud of himself. And the family was so gracious to want to pool together to give him a reward. Love stories like this 🤍
Of course it was a person of colour! 😁
We need more happy news like this 🙌🏽❤️ what an awesome young man he is 💯
Always do the right thing even if no one is watching, well… everyone was watching 🥹
lil skies w/o tattoos
no that's being a real human with a very good soul.. I know when my purse got lost it didn't get returned to me! so this woman is very lucky that a wonderful honest young man returned her purse! and what they did for him was just as awesome
This young man mother raised him right. Great job young man!
I pray for him. He has a beautiful heart and soul.🥺
What aBeautiful store of this young man who did what was right. Great job to the parents for instilling great values. Good things come to those who do good.
Good boy
Good job parents 🙏🏼 Raised a good son
What a lovely young lad
We need more teenagers like this in the world
Great kid!!
God will bless him even more! 🥰 Well done bruh! 🇵🇭
His mom raised a good young man
I lost my wallet twice in a public vehicle. One in 2019 and one this year. Both instances, it got returned by good people who were the ones who even reached out to me in facebook.
good job.
Her and her friend should give that young man a birthday present when he turns 18😘🤫😁
Wao al moust 4K.  Can I be your guardian Angel ? Lol 😆
He should of went ahead and got that phone number too.
What a good kid. Bless his heart!
i can confidently say that my mom wouldn’t be the type of person to return a lost purse she found 😭😖
Well done to this young man, he's a rare type of teen from nowadays. 👏🏽
Thats what a gentleman does!
Thank his Mom for his actions.
well done good kid.... upbringing is important
It does speak alot about him and the upbringing his mother gave him.  God bless this young man and his mother for a job well done.  Raising kids these days its not easy but also not impossible.
wtf
THE REAL FOOS ONLY KNOW THE BIG TRUTH HERE 😂😅🤣 🍑
People in the comments: Oh my goodness, we need more people like this; bless his heart Also, people in the comments: Would've stolen the purse
I love this story,..very proud that he is a good honest young man.  Best wishes for him and his future,.. 💕
So proud of him! I hope to raise my own children that well someday.
I got bad karma coming my way lol probably was no Cash in it jkjk....
I would have returned it too. Just putting myself in the other person's position, it is what I would want someone else to do for me.  But it would be nice to get a reward too!
That’s amazing
Pleasure to share a planet with Adrian.  Is the irrelevant and distracting music essential tho?
Is that a snake on the pathway?
That's how you should bring up a child.
I thought the world was getting worse...this or more accurately Adrian has given me hope for humanity. Thank you Adrian 🙏
He kinda looks like Timothee Chalamet
When she Lose her cup i Will bring IT for her  😂💪
Adrian!!! HERO
<3
Thief: ah, finally, a way to earn some money, legally
He thought he was going to get sum. He seen her id to know where she stay.
Father God, please watch over and protect him; and bring him into the fullness of what You have for him, who You created him to be and accomplish in You. Bless his family. In Jesus' Name, I pray and thank You. Amen.
I cant believe that the woman whose purse was returned, didnt even offer him 20 Dollars or something at the door smfh ..🙄 She definitely took that shyt for granted
This is sweet. Especially because many people would probably have judged him negatively for dressing a certain way. Definitely raised well 😊
Treat ppl how you want to be treated 💗💗
I was not opening my door
God bless 🙏 🙏🙏
You asked other people to donate instead using your own money? It's so easy to get other people sympathy online and gain money lol.
Rise your kids right and with respect and you will get amazing people like him good on him and his mom
Sure they staged it for fame 😂
this is the kind of news i like to wake up to
Nice! He can buy himself a real chain now with that money.
Lmao what a waste of a Gofundme. They had the money to give out. Gofundme should be for people who need the cash. Not some good charity.
Now that’s a reward that’ll encourage others
A 17yr old wearing chains, a backwards cap, with tats all over? I would have misjudged this guy on sight. Shame on ME! 😕
he doesn’t want the money, he wants the mom 👀
This is what I love to see
When we live in a time where doing the right thing makes the news, that is pretty sad. There should be no question about it that is the normal thing you do.
What a champ
I love these kind of preachings from parents. Even my mom taught me not to hurt someone in any way...no matter what...and i still abide by it. I am very careful with my behaviour and words.  Good to see that few people follow such principles in life.
His mother raised him right!
Aaah another gofundme scam. Remember the 'homeless guy who rescued a girl who ran out of gas' gofundme scam?
He returned it because there was nothing valuable in there to take lol
Bless him
Oh wow! Now that's an awesome way to reward someone!
Haha absolutly normal in my country I’m not scared left my things on table :) Idk What is wrong with USA When this is big deal.
I always assumed that's something normal to do, guess it's different in the US.
A true testament that there is still good in the world and that even in this life, we will reap what we sew.
Well done young man, well done 👍👍👍👍
Oh finally something good.
3000 karma points my man 👍
I returned a wallet with 1200& in it plus all his cards such as license.. bank card and so on .. I didn’t do it for a reward but the guy opened the door took it from me and shut the door .. didn’t even say thank you or anything..
I'm turning 17 and Im very hyper analytical and I always try and make to best decision I can in any situation whether it's taking the kids I babysit to the park or helping out someone who made a mess at the grocery store, I believe we should all help others even with small inconveniences because we function better as a community and society that works with one another
Eliana Martin estas bien bonita
he did all this without anyone watching. Wish the best for this fine young man
Imagine if every parent raises and teaches their kids good morals maybe this world would've been a better place. It always starts from home.
Good story all around .Thank you!
There goes a man.
Edgar at its finest
A taxi driver here in my country (Ghana) returned a money a woman left in his car and the rewards he received were more than the woman's money and because of that he has also received a job he never dreamed of, so I think there's a big reward of doing good. Wow there's hope in this generation. God bless this young man. ❤️
Damn if i was him I’d asked her out on a lunch date lol
That lady  on the left looks like Cardi B :-) also so nice they awarded the teen for returning her friends  purse !
Found a purse, saw a hot girls ID and address, shot his shot. Not surprised lol
Good behaviour needs to be rewarded, it will encourage motivation to do more good.
3K?! AND California?! Oh that’s nice… at least now this guy can buy himself a burger.
I did that before nobody gave a damn
Cool !
Well there you have it 😏 there's still good people out there
His mum is a phenomenal person, sadly too many parents should not be parents.  👍to his mum 👍Adrian Rodriguez
💪👏👏👏
Karma is real in this world.
🙌🏾❤
There's hope.
This is a true testament to not judge a book by its cover! He looked like a cholo to be honest, but with a golden heart
When asked why he returned the purse he said     It didn't match his shoes 😳
That was unexpectedly very generous and kind
He took the risk of taking the purse too. I know someone that got in trouble for ''finding a wallet and reaching to the person who lost it '' and called the police right away and told them that he stole it. 😒
Love this
Ehrenmann!!!
how do we know he didnt take the purse, saw nothing of value and took it back hoping for exactly that a reward ? but glad he did a good deed. Hard to trust people now a days
I saw a wallet belonging to an old guy in a Guitar Center parking lot, went through everything inside to find a number in order to contact him, luckily someone found an old guy inside the store and it was him lol
Such a good guy.. respect frm Pakistan 👍🏻
Just want to commend his mom for raising such a kind and honest kid.
He tryna hit
Literally if people just lived by the 2 reasons why he returned it we’d be in a lot better shape as humans.
Sweet boy😇
hes fine too. 😭
This man made the time and effort just for this purse which already tells a lot of his character and even more so his honesty a major plus 👌. That is why I still believe you will never see a person's entirety just by the way they look
He did the right thing by returning it. We need more young, good samaritans like him.🙏👍
"Character is what you do when no one is watching." 🙌👏🤝
I hope he has a good life
I saw this story somewhere can’t remember exact details but a girl found a purse and returned it to the owner an older woman and years and years later someone in the old woman’s family think grandson or something had found a purse and returned it and it needed up being the same little girl that returned their grandmothers  purse years ago. Crazy. Like I said I could be wrong on Small details but this is the just of the story.
Kudos to mom! Good kid right there. He's going to go far in life
Its better to be a good role model for others in order to spread hope and  kindness than to pity ourselves whenever something miserable or unlucky happens in our life.
Nice
Great young man
🤙 positive vibes!! Good stuff
Good boy.
Great American Teen yll should be proud
Bless him
Is always good to be good at anytime
So Proud of him 🏆 🏆🏆.. FYI NO relation .
Cute and a good man. Someone better snatch him up. Lol!
See the car he drives? He don't need that money lol
Ill never forget when someone found my wallet with $700 in it and actually returned it. I was 16 and on the way to visit my mom in another state.
Awesome guy. The right person gonna see this and soon he will be a star.
It speaks volumes about what has become of our country when it’s a big story on tv when someone actually does the RIGHT thing.
He knew that cash was cartel money.
👍awesome!!!! A Good Samaritan ( Need more in this world?) 😉🇺🇸
Great kid there!
Love this, need more positive news,
Llol. Kid obviously saw she was kinda cute so he went to her house. He wouldn’t have if it was a big black man’s purse 👜 👛
Good man
nice reward the kid will now have a good college education
We need more like him. We need more moms like his mom.
Wow what a gentleman 👍
the woman's face shows everything. she seems very happy to receive her purse with nothing taken from it. she wanted to reward him and make him happy just as much as he made her happy I would have done the same.
bravo 👏
this is a news worthy case in the US? LMAO  in my country this is the norm
Whata scary is that this behavior is considered rare.
I would do the same thing but never have any trail if I find stuff so I keep it
Now that's how you reward a good Samaritan! 💯
Noble young man.
The good people still exist. We just don't get recognized more than the bad people!
imagine if when the irish and Italians migrated here they refused to learn our language
What a good boy.
This is weird . I just found a purse in a shopping cart at Walmart and I brought into the store to customer service. I didn’t want to rummage thru their stuff to find id lol.
I don't believe this shyt...
I would have just dropped the bag in the nearest mail box and got the mail man to deal with it.
Eliana sure like Botox
I’d look at that drivers license as also say “sheeeeesh” ok let’s do the right thing 😍😂
He probably saw the ID and thought "I'll probably get some p***y if I return it to this chick" 🤣  Naw all jokes aside though, this was a really good deed. Props to that young man 🙏🏼
We focus way to much on what’s wrong in this world and not enough about what’s right.  This young man is what’s right and should be celebrated.
That's awesome...GOD is good bless him.
Chad parents he has
That a real gang
Wholesome News for a change.
Based
This is real news. Need more like it.
Most people try to do the right thing. We just don't always see it in the news.
I think that's the 1st positive "news" I've seen in 2022.
I lost my wallet last week hope someone gives it to me as well lol going to get a new drivers license is a pain ☠️
🤗💗✌
God bless this young man. I remember when I left my purse on top of my car- it fell off- a teenager returned it..he grew up to be mayor.. I expect great things from this young man..  bravo well done to his mother. Character is doing the right thing because it's the right thing to do.. even when no one is watching!
Good kid and nice ladies.
THANK GOD for good people!!!❤️❤️❤️
As nice a gesture as this was, he could've been shot. This looks like ot could've been a scam. Good on him though.
Cutie 🥰
Not everything is lost 👏
Wow what a wonderful young man, if only there were more people like him, God Bless you son.
He baught it back to get abit back 😈😈
Bro looked like he came from the hood but the way he helped came from the heart
That’s great!! Love it
this is what being raised right looks like
God bless the kid smen.
Bravo………. 👏!
Nope no hope at all for the younger generations. They make far less than their parents they have no ambition no education stare at social media all day and don’t look forward to their future at all.
This is why I love gay people! I've never met a gay person who isn't extremely nice. You can tell he has a very loving boyfriend too with those pretty necklaces he wears.
Lmao dude dressing like a gangster
So we can't do kind things anymore without getting a reward? Not saying he doesn't deserve it but kindness doesn't need a reward
They want to fine him!!??
You see how that works? His mom taught him starting very young 0:58 and he turned out to be a fine young man. If this mom can do it then so can other parents. If more parents taught their children ethics, morals and values so many teens and young adults would not rob, shoot or kill.
Nice young man
That’s cool hopefully he uses the money to benefit his future, like getting his CDL-A
He looks like a gangsta, but he is a good guy
Word Mijo
God bless him.
In other words “man doesn’t steal”… it’s cool that he returned it, but sad that the right thing to do happens much less often than it should.
he looks like a gangster, but is kind like no one else.
wow that's a good kid.
He looks like he probably stole the bag
God bless him!
Crazy how simply doing the right and sensible thing is news now.
That's amazing
Such a good kid   I'm saying this and I'm just 1 year older lol
good dude, but its weird that this is news worthy. is it a rare thing in that country?
“A true selfless act always sparks another”  ~Big Momma
💝 POSITIVELY AWESOME ON EVERYONE'S PART ESPECIALLY THE YOUNG MAN 💝
Imma secretly steal someone’s purse & then return it a day later for that 3k lmao Jk
Ok young ladies... he seems like a good catch. 😉
AWESOME
Sadly, the fact that this type of moral standard is so shocking is a sign that this generation has NO hope.  😪
Good parenting begets good children.  More stories like this please! 🥺😃
Blacks would’ve never returned it
Thats good character..  " do the right thing when even when  no one is  looking " 👍
Right On!
Sweet!
Bless them, huge awards goes to his mother
He probably didn't want doxxed like this
Awesome good for him and her
Proud of you young man. From Nepal. I will follow these simple but meaningful words from your mom. "Always do the right even when no body's watching".
Very surprising considering how inconsiderate this generation is.
I can dig that.....Make your Great grandparents proud, push that good deed to the youth.     Most would have emptied that bad boy.
Great dude
Wow! Small acts of kindness really goes a long way. I wish him nothing but the best and his parents must be proud of him seriously 👏
I'm so happy to see this, the kids nowadays would never do that, but his parents raised him right, which nowadays is basically unheard of
Good job, young man!
“There’s hope for our younger generation” omg stfup
He was RAISED RIGHT...Bless Him.
good stuff young man keep on that path of righteousness.
SOMEONE TAG HIM! He deserves recognition
What a feel good story. Sometimes people do come through in a positive way. God Bless All involved 🙏
Good job kid
Do to others as you would like them to do to you. Luke 6:31  Good boy. Good boy 🙏💐
Cougars
Awesome story!❤️
I have had people return my house keys, my phone and my wallet. I always try to help others in return
Why didnt he just give it to the store manager instead of driver to a strangers house though ? Lol i found a purse and a wallet in shopping carts last week and just gave them to the manager of the store I found them at lol but at least he gave it back . Hes a good guy . Did they say san diego? Lol San Diego in the house🙋🏾‍♀️💞
its good that the woman is not karen, and not accusing him of stealing xD
✨Adrian Rodriguez is the definition of everything we hope our children will grow to be! Kudos to you young man and I know you will go very far in life with that attitude! I would be one proud mama if he was my son! GREAT JOB MOM AND DAD!!! 👍❤️
He knew his momma was gonna whip his ass if he bring that money home
Iloveyou brother keep safe always 🙏🏼
Well done him. What a lovely young man. Bought up to respect others and himself.
If only everyone in this world could be like him, this world would be a better place.
What’s crazy is this happens all the time it just doesn’t go this public, there’s still good people the media only blasts evil though.
His mom instilled good values in her son😊
Good job young man! Continue to always do what is right
Now if he changes he’s dress code and wears some nice slacks and a collar shirt he won’t have to worry about gang bangers targeting him. Hope he makes it into adult hood. I grew up in SE San Diego and my mom dressed me like I was going to church every day and it stuck. I’ve always dressed professionally. Big difference in how you get treated and accepted anywhere you go.
That’s nice to watch, a young man doing the right thing. Inspiration for other youngsters around the world. And I believe he’s going to be very popular around the girls😄
0:07 There's hope for our younger generation." That's such a toxic thing to say. Since the age of the Romans the older generation was always saying, that the younger generation will be doomed and they will be nothing.
You know the world is not okay when basic human decency is being overpraised.
Maybe there is still some hope for our future
This is how parents should raise their kids especially in America, where most parents don’t give a damn and they actually push them to drugs and guns and stealing
❤❤❤❤❤👍🏼👍🏼👍🏽👍🏽
God bless this guy. 🙏🏿
Good job young man.
Need more people like this it be a better world 💯
Good for you man! God saw that and he will bless you.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Very well done by this guy, the incident revises our thinking to be less ignorant towards our fellow human beings , as well as to be more aware and careful towards our belongings.
Well done young man🙌
Man of God right there!
Dude is swagged up too
That purse called it’s self the most expensive uber drop off ever 😭
Props to not only the kid but for his mom as well. Taught him right from an early age. Just sorry stuff like this is rare anymore. Doesn’t say much about society nowadays
Good Man  God Keep Him Safe
Someone is raising their kids right. I drove across town to return a woman’s wallet with ID & bank cards I found at park & she didn’t even say thank you.
Good job
Why didn't they interview him??
He has a beautiful face, the young man, he looks like a good person.  So glad it worked out the way you did with the lady received her personal items back and he received a big reward.
Imagen filming a report on a returned purse
That’s awesome God bless him 🙏🏽❤️🙏🏽
Amazing story
Niiice
Here in the Philippines, this is only possible in a dream.
Good lad 👍
I love his reasons for returning it. If I lost something important, like my wallet, I would hope that someone would return it.
Dang, good job bro (if you see this). Proud of u
Good job my guy ❤️
He was trying to smash for sure
What a good guy ! Bless him x
Bruh I woulda turned down the 3k n just asked for a night with the Latina momma right there
Imagine getting paid 3K for doing the bare minimum I-🚶
thought that was dappy
Nba2k23
Amazing!!!
Well that’s you but On the other hand me oh I’m finna turn
His mama taught him right right before Christmas I left my wallet in the front of the shopping cart and I had all my Christmas money in it and one of the bag boys got my license out called me and returned it not one cent missing and I gave him some money and he said oh thank you now I can get my mom something nice it made my heart smile
Here is the thing for me i feel like this is a normal reaction from the guy to do in this world...Getting something that is not yours back to  its owner..We live in a world were we give a reward for something that should be a normal action to do..Having said that i am happy he did it and i feel like everybody should do this..But unfortunately this is more not the case then it is.
And he is really a fine young man.
Good man.
I hope this young man goes far in life.
Great job young man and may God Bless you for a job well done!
That kid is probably Christian. Just looking at his surnamen. Just guessing though
The parents raised a fine young man.
God bless this young man!
damn he’s cute too
Yeah this is nice by the boy but I got this beat. Was in a parking from cashing a check I got from doing a job and I realized dropped 100bucks and Im yelling profanity words fword etc and looking on the floor for it in the parking lot as heard someone say is this what your looking for😆😆 as they ask me what's the bill I'm looking for as I told them and they handed me my hundred dollar bill. I offered for them to wait as I would go in store so I could give them 50bucks and they wouldn't accept despite me insisting and demanding they take it.
That's what us Mexican parents teach our kids
This will come back to this young man,there is hope in America.
Good deeds like this shouldn't be a rare occurance, it should be the norm.
Such a good young man.
💪🏽💪🏽🤝
Well done!
Good boy
If he had been pulled over while driving to the house he'd be in jail rn 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Good work everybody!!!!
Jesus loves you ❤
Pilot twist: this guy stole the purse and returned it for money
Honestly; Honesty is the best policy (corny but true).
I will return everything give me 3 grand
Awe 😭😭
She needs her ticket for not changing her address 😂
I almost felt like I was watching a sci-fi movie. That is such a rare behavior.
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Such a wonderful story!
Yes! Darma ;)
Well Deserved  this Brought  tears to my eyes Well done Mum,  for Bringing Up Such A good and Decent Young Man
WHOEVER READING THIS I PRAY THAT WHATEVER YOUR GOING THROUGH GETS BETTER AND WHATEVER YOUR STROLLING WITH OR WORRYING ABOUT IS GOING TO BE FINE AND THAT EVERYONE  HAVE A BLESSED DAY 🙏🏽💙
Wow, she didn't get scared and locked the door because of his gender?
I returned a wallet I found once. I took money out to pay for postage but put the receipt in so she could see what it cost to post it back. She sent me a thank you card with a cute elephant on it. It was nice.
Dont judge the look
Plot Twist: he initially stole it but then said he found it
I never comment on anything. But that man deserves a alot of respect after that one
well done young man...!!~ur mom raised u rght..!!
Good job young boy
WHOEVER READING THIS I PRAY THAT WHATEVER YOUR GOING THROUGH GETS BETTER AND WHATEVER YOUR STROLLING WITH OR WORRYING ABOUT IS GOING TO BE FINE AND THAT EVERYONE  HAVE A BLESSED DAY 🙏🏽💙
Oooh this young guy has a good heart bless him! Good job Mum you raised a real gentleman ♥️
That's his gud upbringing.Thanx to his mom.
GTA pays more 🥱
An angel of God 🙏
I knew he had to be rodriguez 👍👍
Wow! This just warms my heart! God bless that young man. 💜🙏
If there were more people like him this world would be a much better place! Great job young man your parents raised you well✊🏻
Fake
I'm a Rodriguez! From  OC California.
I found a guy’s LV wallet with few hundred dollars in it once and I also returned it to him by going to the address on the drivers license. However when I arrived and buzzed the apartment, they didn’t answer the door bell, so I tired a few times and finally they did only to tell me i got the wrong address when I asked is this number 20?? Only when I mentioned the name on the drivers license the stooge comes down..
This is based on his upbringing. Good parents ❤
awesome!😘👍 no
Wow.I wish everyone in the world was like this
I would’ve looked at the I.d and returned it just to ask her out 💯🔥🔥🔥
Good on him! Sad that we don't see stories like this more often.
There's hope yet
In love 😻
❤❤❤❤
Lovely boy.
What a nice kid to return the purse.
HE FINE😭
He was hoping he would get a date 😂
Someone mailed my grandma’s wallet back to her 😭
i did the same thing for a guy last summer i worked at a mall found his wallet in the parking lot money and all wish i got 3 grand for it lol lol
🤔
I commend this young man! His parents taught him well!
Plus he’s so cute bruh
My last name in rodriguez
Wow good kid👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽❤
Good  people
Guys like him is very rare nowadays.
Nice kid, his mama raised him right. I believe in karma and the Golden Rule. Treat others how you would like to be treated and whatever you put out into the world will come back to you. If I found someone's purse, I would return it immediately. Things that go missing always get returned to me because I live my life like this. KARMA IS REAL!!!
Wow  good kid
Wish more people were like this young guy. This is actually great to see
"There's hope for our younger generation" I laughed at that 🤣 no there isn't 🤣
It's nice and all but the fact that this Made the news is kinds gross.   Like " ,,omg look someone was honest"   "That's our headline !!!"
A/
Still good people in the world and that is absolutely amazing to hear
Beautiful people love it 🙌🏾❤️🎉
we know why he did that
i wouldn't have bothered driving i would have just turned it in at the closest police station
Looks: Thuggest of Thug Work: Finest of Good Samaritan Man
HE FINE ASH
Way to go young man 👍👍
💪 awesome, what a outstanding young man. 💖😁
Looks gangster but has angel heart 🥺💖🙏
I wouldnt even think , i would just take it
A month ago I found a wallet with 2000€ in it. It belong to an old lady that let it fell when she went to buy bread. She was so happy that I found it because on our area there's a lot of school and I'm 99% sure that if a kid found it the money would be gone! Please people let's always act like we would love for people to treat us. 🙏 There is enough evil in this world 🥺
If only the media focused more attention to these good deeds
this is great. did this few times with phones and such. one guy gave me 25$ for finding his id on the ground, picking it up and searching for him on instagram. ha it happens. :)
Good guy 👍
he probably goes to church
Good lad
Wasn’t it strange.... the woman did that for publicity 🤔
Finally a good new for once I wish I can see more good news like this, is beautiful to see and gives me hopes!
Probably the teen doesn't care about the value of the purse. But he rip his rewards.
Ok? ppl return stuff everyday and some of them don’t get 3k
Finally a good video about a young man who was raised right. Not one bit of bad news in this video except the woman losing her purse.
Cheap, raggedy tramp! Now she wants to offer something! SO SAD! I would have given him at least $100 just for bringing my purse back!!!
It's crazy how most people wouldnt even look at someone like him cause of his skin color or cause of the way he's dressed & judge them based on his appearance alone not knowing how kind he really is.
Way to go! What a good young man AND what a great mom who taught her son to do the right thing. I’m so glad he was rewarded for his good deed. That’s becoming a rare thing with people these days.
Can’t believe doing something nice hits the news these days. That’s how messed up the world is right now
❤
Great job that guy, well done
Awesome! Hope this young man has some goals in life because he will achieve them. 👍👍👍
I'm sorry but if I used a stereotype I would say he's a bato loco or a cholillo marihuano 😉😉😆😆😆
This should come naturally as human beings. To return some one's else things is something which should be basic human nature but times have changed now. Very good lad and a big congratulation to his first teacher his Mom.
Outstanding person. Bravo to the mom which raised him.
A good young man! May he stay well & blessed, may all his dreams come true.
That's sweet and they gave him some money beautiful child 👍🧸
He do be attractive tho👀😩😂💋✨ Like attractive and a good heart? Yesss sirrrr😭😩😂👍🏻
I returned this guy's wallet with $500 and I remembered seeing him in college. So I rang him once, twice, and three times. I could smell a lot of week from his apartment room. So he must've been so high. I went to the police station and drop it off. I told everything to my brother after I came back. And all he got from me is "you sending police to weed head?! Did you know weed is still illegal in our state!!" Man, I though I did a right thing but my brother have a point.
good job young man! you inspire me to always do the right thing even when no one is watching, thank you!
This is what robbers should do because the will earn more money then that was in the purse lmao
I would bring it back too. It's the human thing to do, but unfortunately it's scarce to find people like that today. HES awesome!!
I’m just happy we’re sharing the positive things happening in the world
If I was his mother I would be so proud of him she did a wonderful job one proud mom to another ❤️ 💙
That was very kind, honest and thoughtful of a young man to return the lost purse.
Isn't this just the best 😊
Heheh like the 1 good kid in California. Make us all a believer!
Cougar put fine young men Das right playa🥵
👏👏👏👏👏👏
i hope the left woman was aware of her lumpy neck, go see a doctor if not.
If only he was 18 😏👏👏
What a way to make a quick 3k 😫👌🏽
Why is this like GTA5 when you retrieve someone's wallet/purse 😂
Dang....if there was that type of reward everytime I'd go looking for purses and quit my job.
This is how we do  in the 619.  Americas finest city, always has been ,always will be! Catch padres fever!!!
Beautiful!!!! He got a good mom!!!!
What a good lad good on ya mate
May your life be blessed with all the best the world has to offer. ❤️ Have a marvelous life.
This is the only kind of news I like!!
I can marry this person right now.
So sad that THIS is such a surprise.  This should be standard human behavior.  😔
Salute
What a great guy
I'm very impressed with this young man especially in today's world.  He deserves the reward and honor.  BTW God is always watching.
magnificent
Some booty would have been nice as a thank you
Something this small is so big in this cruel world what a great guy. :)
I bet his mum is so proud.  ❤
A good heart wow😍
What if he was....  K
Good to see
Restoring faith in humanity
This is how the world have to works
I've driven an hour out of my way to do the same and she was annoyed I bothered her.  Was a good lesson. Now I'll just take the money.
Thank you sir. Keep doing it even though it's thankless sometimes.
He's a good listener of advice & noble.
All a Set up.
Kudos to him and his parents.
cute, respectful, & honest?😋
yoo wtf he looks like me and has the same style
That's what Jesus would do!
Good story..
he does look like hood gang with some fake gold chain and lower pants but good job for him for doing the right thing
He was raised right in the crazy messed up 🌎 Good for him and his family, he is going to make a great family man one day!!! Sending positive vibes and love your way young man!
What a fine young man!  What a great loving group of friends and family!!
What a beautiful soul blessings ❤️🙏🤗
Hes just doin his thang
Lol I love how this is the "hope" for our generation.
Of course he returns it, he is not black!
Fun fact: if you say “fun fact” people will read it.
Good fir him.
Well deserved because of the honesty.  God bless.
He's kinda cute
Nice young man 🥰
We need more like him in the government
We need more like him in the government
That’s so awesome!! may he continue to be blessed!!
Really cool young man.
This is rare good guy.
Lord bless this young man with health wealth & happiness. 🙏🏽
This made my heart happy
What a time to be alive when we celebrate mediocrity and common sense
Hope for America
Do the right thing even if no one is watching....only our 💙Father💗 knows He sees everything and everyone....
We ain’t all bad
That's definitely a man I would want my daughter to bring home. Good for him and his mother. She did a great job raising him right!! Even in this dayinage. Bless his heart
Lucky
We robed that fool after mf started flexing
This is like a random strangers mission.
Great kid. Proud of you bro
Reminds me of grade 7 when I told my math teacher he'd accidentally given me extra marks on the test and he was so impressed that he just let me have them anyway. Did the same thing with an exam in university and my TA took the marks off lol
Money is nice , but the good karma pays Off ten fold. 3k could wreck a 17 year old. Hope that doesn't happen.
Cuz she bad asf lmao
Everyone say we need A kind hearted people like this time and age. But no one wants to be the Kind heart this days
I had a similar experience returning someone's wallet that I found one time. The guy actually gave me the $5 that was in it and me thanked me because he didn't have to get all his ID and stuff replaced. Glad I did it.
🤘🏿👍🏿
He's cute
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🖤
Wow.  Someone that age actually went out of his way to do the right thing?  Whaaaa.....  ?!
Proud of this young man he deserves that 3K love seeing good people win in life ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love him and the mom🤝
I'm so especially proud that it was a Latino young man. The racism is worse than ever against us. Seeing this and the attention it got is heartwarming.
W
I’m definitely not saying this fake because I don’t know and the guy seems genuine but geez, such an easy thing to fake to get some quick fame and money
He's a very honest good person
Plot twist: he took out the cash and switched them with fake ones
He is the opposite of the black loser. That punched my sister & took her purse.
I would of ask for a date for the person with lost bag 🥲👉🏼👈🏼😅💯
Shittin me.
Good boy
We need more kids like this young man!!
That’s right 🫡
His mama needs a reward as well
His parents raised him right, Then he took over and steered the course of his life - right! Bravo young man!  You restored hope to many.
This just goes to show, that he may be dressed like a “thug” that he is actually a fictional member of society who actually cares about others
If he stole it in the first place 😂😂😂
We need more stories like this on the news
Truth is he really wanted get at them Hot Milfs. That's why he returned. 😁👍🏼
Wow.. very heartwarming.. That young man is truly a gem.. He was raised well.. And those ladies who started the GoFundMe account for him.. Just simply "Wow".. God is still showing His Kingdom Glory Love through us human beings!!! Amen
Wow he deserves everything
Imagine it was all a scam for the go fund me. Might try something like this, it’s a dog eat dog world I don’t wanna hear it 😂
I wish more news was like this
This is normal in my country, why he get reward?  That weird.
When I was little, I was playing in the clothes racks at Kmart 🤭😁 while my grandma was browsing around. Bad girl, lol. Anyway, I found a wallet, a man’s wallet. Picked it up, showed it to my grandma. She put it in her purse, finished her shopping, we go home, and she gets out the phonebook. It was the 90s so ya know, phonebooks. She called up the owner of the wallet, said her granddaughter had found it at Kmart. The man was so relieved and happy. Arranged to meet at a McDonald’s or something, some public place, can’t remember. The man had some cash in his wallet, which he did not hesitate to remove and hand to me for doing a good deed. I never forgot that. This boy was taught well :) ⭐️
Que lindo
Edgar doing good things
Aw, this is the kind of good news I like. 👍
One of my darker brothers from I think it was Chicago did a good deed I think by helping some old lady and they gave him a very new car but not brand new but still for helping somebody else.
Omg what a good boy😊👍. This boy is a perfect example that in this madness what happend in this world, a really good soul! Thanks to his parents that raised him so well, and teaching him the right way 👏
Some foos just go the right thing all tho he looked like a down ass foo lol 😂
Thank you! Please teach your children the way your mom taught and raised you.. which im sure you will.. the humanity needs more like you.
His parents should be an example of this young man. Good home training everytime I see this. He's going to be a great husband and father someday 🙏 God bless him
This is how one heck of a porn would start .. milf
It’s so sad that someone doing the right thing is news and not just considered NORMAL. Oh well. Good job lad!
❤️❤️ proud of him
That’s a good mom
Great human ❤️❤️❤️❤️ That’s hard to find.
We all know he saw how fine she was and was hoping to score XP
Nice boy!!!!
💗💗💗💗💗
Such a good young man.
He's a fabulous young man! He will always do the right thing.  Hi mamma taught him to a perfect gentleman!
Such a good young man
Nice to hear some positve news for a while...very awesome
What a sweet-heart.
Bro checked the purse then returned it 🤣🤣
That’s a good kid, he did the right thing!
Good people do exist
Inside edition should given him the funds they raise from this video 😂😂
❤️❤️❤️
It’s all started from the parents
damn,$3k,thats alot and this is why we should returns things to their owners so we can get more money $$$yaaaa
If only Society was like this instead of being full of problematic and complaining snowflake generations.
the og with proper conscience
and he so cute too
He just wanted to smash lol
He a good kid💀 bro was sagging and probably thinks he’s a banger
Good for you young man 👍👍👍
Wholesome news right there :)
Awesome 😎 that is beautiful acts of our youth doing the right thing congratulations
should have got his D
Wow this almost. Makes me cry. Good job 👍
Yay, a heart warming, honest, and positive story. So use to tragic stories in my feed. This one really was gold.
And now he's 3k richer! Boy I would kill for that money
Good young man!!!! More balls then older men. Kudos !!!
I totally get his good deed, I have done the same before and it feels good to do something like that for someone because I would want the same done for me.
No cap he smashed both of em ☠️
😊🙏🧡😇 todavía existe Gente Buena Dios Bendiga a ese Joven por su buena obra
The fact this is news is sad.  This should just be expected and normal...
warms my heart. 💓💓💓💓
Hell yeah brother. Use that money for a little vaca
This young man almost completed the test that the universe presented to him.  He needs to understand that a good dead is its own reward and should have politely declined the offer of money or at least donated it to a good cause.  We open doors for others not for a "thank you", but because it is the right thing to do.
new tutorial just dropped boys
Plot twist: He knew if he returned the purse that the owner would be so grateful that he would receive way more in return from the owner then what was left in the purse all about da hustle 💯😂
Goof for him. He's good Soul
May God be praised for this good and kind action. Godbless the wellraised young man.
He probably wanted some top in return. Lmao jk
Honesty is always the best policy.
Found 20 dollars today. Now I regret it.
LOOK HER SAYING THERE IS HOPE FOR OUR YOUNGER GENERATION AND LOOK THEIR MAKE UP WITHT THEIR PURGE. bro if I knew she said that I just sold that purse
He is raised right. 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Dude was dressed for the misjudgment criticism. Yeah boy 🤣
Excellent job Young man.❤
Love this so much
Great job Adrian! Your mum’s raised you well!
Good choice my man
Integrity
He will be an amazing dad and a husband
💪🏾💯✨
Never thought people that looks like gansters ( not saying it in a bad way) would do something like that 💸💸
We need the whole world like this, helping eachother instead of bringing them down.
What a good kid it’s so rare now days to see this
Wu Tang Forever
May God watch over and protect him!
😊😊😊🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Good on you, young dude. Very heartwarming story
What a beautiful hearted young man. Love the post script to the story of the raising donations for his reward . Helping others always helps us in the end.
This guy thought he was being a good person and or meeting a lady and ended up on the news 😂 props
Good job buddy
Makes me wanna do good to people. 360🤔
Compassion is way stronger then destruction.
This makes me happy.
I'M SURE HER MOM INSPIRES ALL THE OTHER MOMS OUT THERE FOR RAISING A GOOD KID! THIS BOY WILL GO A LONG WAY 💕
Good for him.good parenting
Anyone got Eliana’s @?
And Mexican?
💯 he deserves it
it's a story  America needs
These clearly wealthy woman should have gave the reward out of there own pockets instead they expect others to pick up there slack. Pathetic.
plot twist: he stole the purse in the first place, then used the 3k to buy drugs😂
Good kid! We need more stories like this one so the younger generation will follow and set a new trend since they’re in this sort of stuff!
What's he gone do with them make ups and tampons anyway so great job 🤣
💚💯
Lord please forgive me for my sins,im not proud of it but in the financial situation im in at the moment...sad to say but theres a 80% chance i most likely would of kept it...and im a kind hearted giving human....Good on this bloke,da man
Americans Rock love em
Adrian...that's a good name.
Fake !
There is hope for this young generation ....soooo trueee...
His mom raised him correctly. Wtg to his mom & most importantly to this young man.
My man's makin' us Adrians' look like gentleman! Heck yeah!
man he’s so fine
Hi 5 !👋
Brown Pride ✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽
Love this!!!!
Bro picked up a ounce and some carts💯
The ladies were nice too, they could have been Karen's & accused him of taking it or taking money.
THAT is one awesome hero.....🇺🇸
Gd on ya mate for doing the right thing,,the world needs more people like u,,your mum should feel very proud,she,s raised a fine young gentleman..gd work!!!!!..
He’s not even my son but I’m extremely PROUD of him. He was raised right with love, morals and integrity. God bless him! So happy to see a young Hispanic man showing the world to do the right thing! Setting examples! 👏🏼👏🏼🙏🏼
And yet society would profile him 😔
Respectful and fine !
Dnt say rewards just say good nature
Men of culture
Work in silence...
There was probably no cash in the mf that’s why he gave it back lol
What An amazing boy. There really is hope out there
👍🏾✌🏾❤
This was the way it was when I was a young girl. People had respect for one another. They had manners. Now it’s every man for himself. It’s a sign of the times when someone makes the news because they did the right thing. Much respect to that young man❣️
Black people, if this ever happens to you, please call the police first.
The kindness you put out in this world always has a a way of coming back to you- Dhar Mann
Somebody raised their son right. GOD bless that young man and his family's kind soul. ❤
bless you Adrian✨
his mother did a wonderful job with him.
Bet u he was not expecting the aunt to open the door tho 🤣
He deserves all that reward!!! 👏👏👏👏 good job mom!!!
👏
What a good kid!! I love these good stories. 💖
That was a great story! A nice and humble young man!
This kids part of the humanity we need more of in this world.. looks like a standup guy as well
Kudos
This is what America is right here
What an amazing young man 👏 very proud
Damn Eliana, how you lose your purse on yo day off?
👏👏👏👏Good job young man 👨!!!
Heart warming
Theirs so much more good in the world then bad, don’t forget that!
That boy look like ji
this Young Man listened to the training from his Mum. He chose to do the right thing! I am so happy he is getting rewarded for his excellent moral character. This act off honesty is powerful, a lot of other young (and old) people will watch this and learn a powerful Biblical life lesson - If you sow good things, you will reap good things!!!❤❤❤
I gotta give this young one respect I come from a neighborhood of struggle and poverty and Im just gonna say it already half you people on the comments would have been quick to judge this young man as something he’s  not it’s happened to many of Latinos and other minorities with little understanding that a person as himself will stand tall and strong next to you instead of stealing or belittling one, be kind hearted and see past the evil manifesto, if it wasn’t for the title and explanation of what he did you guys would have tore him up…. God bless and keep the good deeds coming
Takes a purse then returns it like he’s honest then gets rewarded money, pure Genius he’s going places!!
Suchhhhhh a good kid! His mama raised him very well, good job mama bear.. and handsome boy you have 😍💕
Doing good gets awarded for the best 😁so do you
This is a wonderful story to see after just watching one where someone was killed over too much mayonnaise on a sandwich!  What a great kid to do this, and I'm so glad they raised money for him since he did it without any expectations of reward.
he fine too🤭
As a mother of sons, I have said the same things. I love how boys still listen to their mama's ♥️ What a great story!
What an honest young man!  It pays to do the right thing!  Blessings 🙏 Jesus Christ Saves Souls 🙏 1st Corinthians Ch15 Verses1-4 KJV/ESV
yea cuz I would've just taken it to the lost and found 😂
We ain't all bad, we just fit the  description.
Kid that was raised right. Good for him. ❤
Need more news like this
I BET in the back of his head, he was hoping he'd get some - if you know what I mean. Lmao
What a great young man!! Good karma coming his way
May God bless him and his family!! Such a wonderful example of morality and integrity 💖😇
It’s amazing what he did, and I’m so happy for the woman and the young man.  However, in a way, it’s kinda sad that doing something that should be normally done is considered national news.
He was raised right 💯 💯
More of this please 🙏🏾 😍 ❤️!
Yay!!!!!!! Adrian!!! 👍🏾 💯
Good job young man☺️😎👍
Don’t judge
This young man is being raised right. God bless him and his mom. 😍😍
Social contract 🤍
salute to humanity
That’s what I teach my 8 year old. I hope he listens to me when he gets older. This young man is a credit to his mum .
That’s awesome!!
What a nit wit kid he stole purse then act like found it just to get money! Me angry he misuse go fund pal to get money
Good man . Yeah . Man . God bless him .
That’s a young king raised right. Shoutout his parents
What an upstanding young man!! This is amazing.
Good karma ♥️
He low key looks like a thug lol
Awe how wonderful.. heart warming he did a good thing,  he shall be rewarded with good karma ! Continue to do good things young one!
I return already 3 bags with money and credit cards to people lose them , people want me to give money back - I don’t think people need a reward for helping others .
The ‘fine’ young man bit is hella sus icl
We need more people like this young man to work in the white House.
I am so happy he got rewarded for doing something as great as this. And I hope a lot more people who do the same thing can get rewarded like him also. 🥰
faith in humanity
I've done this many times but never got a reward.
That made me feel like there’s hope
Outstanding young man!
I need to be like him...😔
That is very wonderful, and a blessing may the Lord bless him. 🙏 💛
May God continue to bless this young gentleman. He truly has a good heart ❤️
he’s so fine.
This is what kids should focus on doing instead of shooting guns like they're toys. NYC really has a huge gun problem smh. I mean, it's everywhere but every night I'm hearing about how someone died from gun violence somewhere in the 5 burrows.
Why does this seem so fake… anything for a go fund me lol
May God bless this young man richly 🙏🙏🙏
What a nice fella
🫡🇺🇸our boys
Good kid
What a cool kid
Instead of commenting “we need more people like him” or “instead of saying we more people like him, we should be more like him” or like this  generation needs to step up and honestly have common sense to be looking out for each other and continue to grow stronger as more generations will come.
Never judge a book by it covers
It only takes but 1 to stand up against evil. Good versus evil folks, right versus wrong! Amen! May this young man, be Blessed throughout his life.👼🏽👼🏽
The next time he touches a lost purse he will get himself into big trouble.
Admirable and few and far between good job to the parents this young man we need more like him in the days ahead.
What a sweetheart. And the fact that hes also dressed like a stereotypical "gangster" someone we might actually fear.
What a wonderful young man .
This was something I really needed to see. 👍
aww 🥰 sweet hurt
God Bless him and his mama for teaching him right
Nice going Adrian and God bless you.
We live in an informal social credit system
up 3 bands + good karma , W
How nice of him
Ooo and he fine  fine
Locoo!! Proud of you fam
I was couple times return a cards. First was a credit card that I found at the gazebo in the park. Give it to the police officer who was parking at the vacant lot. Second was a driver's license found at the playground at the park.  I could not find him in fb, so I give it to the police officer who was parking at the side of the road. It was a great experienced though to stop by at the police car with a good reason and they will thanks to you.
He was raised 🙌🏻 Right
Please  people don't expect a reward for doing the right thing...if you get it it's good but if you don't it's ok too.
Wow. I'm so proud of this young man. Can you imagine if everyone had this kind of respect for others - He is so honorable. I hope he does something good with the gofundme money, like it helps him with something he's struggling with. God Bless you , Adrian Rodriguez, keep being you.
Idk I'm 17 rn and I would definitely do this if I found a purse and I feel like that's pretty common in my generation so if this is "bringing back faith in humanity" for some of you idk what to tell you our generation is pretty sweet
Nah bruh just wanted some 🐱
Love stories like these
Good boy  we need more  People  like that
Great job young man..your mom is a very smart lady to
Wow my heart melted when I saw this. To know that a young person heeded his moms words, and to always do the right thing. I hope this young gentleman goes far and has a very successful life.
Why didn't you blur his face like you do for underaged criminals?
Good man 🙌
The price of honesty pays pretty well
Omgsh sooooooo AWESOME!!! like literally nowadays standards he’s basically a hero lol
Ow
Bro did it because of how peng she is godammmmm
I found a lady's wallet in a shopping cart two years ago at the grocery store. It didn't have any money in it so I put $10 In it and then returned it. I just thought that would be funny.  I didn't get to see her reaction as I left it with her insurance agent as that was the only address it had in it.  I hope it brightened her day.
This is the side I remember and love so much of my Hispanic Culture,  good job mom!!! Muy buen trabajo mamá!!!!
Amazing job young man! Proud to be living on the same ground as you.
I thought that was Eminem ngl
Good he’s not robbing ulta stores he was raised by good parents
I've done the same many times but was never on the news lol
A G being a real G as a bean that gets criticized myself for how i look this shh make me happy to see there others beans that would do the same
King👑❤
He would’ve got licked on for the rest of the night
Stop playing. He was trying to smash 😂
Now comments here be like:- Some people:-“The world needs this kinds of people” Others:- *We need to become like this* Me:- WhY dO I hAvE tO seE ThE sAme ThInG AgAin and AgAin💀
Look at the lady that got her purse back. Audi in the driveway (could be hers or her friend’s) face full of expensive Botox she can’t even move her lips. Why did they start a go fund me instead of just giving him cash themselves? They can definitely afford it.
His mom was correct, she taught him well. God is always watching. What nice young man.
This is wonderful. Thank goodness his Momma raised him to be a good person. God bless this young man and the lovely woman who went above and beyond to recognize this good deed. Sounds like the ladies have fantastic family as well. 💙💙💙💙
300 buck would've sufficed. Now they will start demanding thousands if they do a good deed.
❤️❤️❤️
Wonder how much cash was in the purse he returned it money on the credit cards lol 😆 ……🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑👍🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐
The face he makes when he looks into the camera after ringing the bell just looks so kindhearted...I hope this kid has a wonderful life 😭
Good boy
Plot twist: He already checked the bag but  there wasn't anything useful in it so he brought it back. In the hope the reward would be something...and something it was...  ...yea    ...we all know it's not a plot twist...that's what really happend...
there's a very very proud momma bear out there. fine young man.
💜💜💜
Thank you for being a good human  kid.
The mother did good education! She will be proud of him! The world need more and more people like him.
wow the bare minimum 😍❤️❤️
Dam that's crazy my gf lost her wallet with i.d and everything  😕 no one returned
If it would've been a bit darker, that purse would've never been seen again!!
My wife spent two days of her vacation doing detective work to find a military based young man that she found his wallet with $500 in it. She found him and returned it to him. It should not be shocking that the wallet was returned. It is the normal thing to do!   I dropped my wallet once in a restaurant and the family eating at a table grabbed thier food and kids, stole my wallet and haulled ass before I realized what was going on.
HES GOAT TEEN GOAT! 🥰❤️🔥
He's gonna be one of the few kids in this generation who'll grow up a good person
Respect
what a wonderful young man! keep up the good work!
I LOVE THIS STORY, HIS MOM RAISED HIM VERY WELL. I HOPE AND PRAY THAT THE LORD JESUS CHRIST WILL BLESS HIS LIFE AND GIVE HIM GREAT OPPORTUNITYS FOR HIS FUTURE...
good job young man
Whatever…. That kid looked her up and was like…. $payday$
One in the millions  Good job bro
Good feels ❤️
Finally! News that's actually good
I just got chills.... What a SWEETHEART
he doesn't even seem like someone that would do something like that tbh. Never judge a book by it's cover!
It's too early to cry 😭
You shouldn't have to pay someone for doing a good deed for doing the right thing, you don't pay them for that. What you need to do is keep moving it forward so he did this for you so now you need to do something, for someone else and then whoever you help needs to do something, for that person it's not about financial gain, it's about gaining more of what's inside of you  it shouldn't be focused on trying to give him money, I'm glad his mom raised him, right. That's a great mom.
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Thank you 🙏🏻🙏🏻
This is what integrity is, doing the right thing at the right time even when *NOONE* is watching.
Adrián a real one
"You must love your neighbor as yourself." (Matthew 22:39) ❤️ This young man followed the Bible principle of treating others as he would want someone to treat him. He displayed humility by not acting in order to be seen and receive praise by man. *Well done good Samaritan* 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Before he stole it first
Good kid man
I’m 17
at least we know there’s at least one good person in this world 💜
Love this ❤️ 💙 💜
Wow this young kid is beautiful in heart and soul
Good parenting
That’s so wonderful! Yayyy!!!
PROOF THERE IS STILL GOODNESS IN THIS WORLD!
Aww so sweet
He for sure got top from those milfs
This story made my day :)
Good news is good for people. We as humanity need this.
Dam rite
That’s something I’ll be telling my daughter , do the right thing even when no one is watching
Strong work Adrian!!!!! 🔥
I did that once when I was a line cook in Savannah.  I saw a woman ( tourist) drop her pocket book out of her purse as I was walking on Bay Street.   I caught up to her to her and returned it.    I didn’t get any reward.  I didn’t expect one.  I sleep well though.
I mean its nice and all but idk..its pretty sad that this makes the news because being decent person is that rare you know?
Hella studios
This one time in 5th grade I found a teachers phone in the halls and me a my friend went to return it to her during lunch only to have her take the phone and shut the door in our faces without even saying thankyou never down that since
At least there is still some good in the word.
👌wow
Damn the most cliche 5th grade composition ever
he can buy a belt now😄
Well done young man!
Now that’s a young man with integrity. He did the right thing when nobody was looking.
Good job kiddo! Proud of u.😊😊
Integrity. Honour. It’s in every act, even the small ones. Especially, maybe. Wonderful to see.
Just 3 weeks ago Saturday morning, I found a driver's license,  a credit card and a debit card, and a school ID of a HS senior during my walk with my dogs. Located the house address from DL, and returned it to her dad who opened the door.  All I got was a thank you.😂
Well i don't think he had a choice in the matter  If he took the purse for himself he would have been caught and arrested later anyway.
Always do the right thing when nobody's watching= integrity. I swear that's so rare these days.. Way to go mom and dad
and hes smokin hot too 🤭🤭
The world is so bad right now that someone doing a simple ass civil act is newsworthy lmao
Respect!
I drive Uber once in a while. A couple years ago some drunk college chick left her big assh purse in the back seat. Lucky for her she was my last ride for the night. Saw it the next morning and luckily remembered where her house was. Gave it to her.....NOT EVEN A THANK YOU. I live about 20 minutes away from SDSU....
They should take him out on a date   Actually I wonder if that has anything to do with him going to return it. He saw the good looking woman on the driver's license picture
Awesome
You did the right thing..
🙌🏾🙌🏾
☺️❤ good news! God bless him.
Awesome guy !! I am happy he was rewarded , thank you 😊
His good deed really paid off.
Good kid
This is so sweet and surprising because 17 year old boys usually look the other way. I wouldn’t have assumed he’d steal it but he took time out of his day to get the purse and drive it to the address on the license. He’s an exceptional young man
He was knowing ,he will be rewarded that's why he did it😉
❤️
Very nice and commendable work. This boys gonna grow up to be a responsible adult :]
Great kid.  I, too, lost my wallet once, back in the 90s.   An older lady back then found it.   I was in my early 20s myself.   She tracked me down by means of my drivers license, she turned out to live right down the street I lived on back then.   I got her flowers.
They didnt give him the 3k though
That's what I'm talking about...He just PUNCHED LUCIFER in the face...
He’s probably the one who stole it lol
Money as a reward is bad... . Doing good thing is itself a reward
Integrity is doing the right thing even when nobody is looking....what a fine young man :)
and he’s so attractive😭
This is so awesome wonder in so many ways. 💜💜🤗🤗💪💪
Awesome
That's what you called good parenting. ❤️
Can I come over ?
That is good advice his mom give to him and the reward was so awesome, he seems a good guy
Sad that this isn't just normal.
Great job young man...keep it up..God Bless..🙏🙏👍👍.. Your mom did a great job raising up..
My boy representing San Diego the right way 💪🏼🔥
Praise the Lord 🙌🏽 well done young man 👏🏽👏🏽 All God's blessings to you 🙏
Women, careless with their belongings! Before the young man returned her purse i bet the husband had to purchase a new purse for her
This makes my heart swell ♥
Kid looks like a thug too. Can't judge a book by its cover
The wholesome community we meet again :’)
Kool stuff, hopefully people see it's OK to be a good person to make a decision that will be a very important and good feeling doing what he just did,,,
God bless him! I pray that he does not become the victim of all the creeps in this world.
Thats wussup !! 🤙🤙
A lady once left her purse in the metro in Amsterdam. They were chatting excitedly and got up and left. I took the purse home, checked her phone and called.  Her dad came and was so happy, as the purse had her flight ticket and passport, and she was to travel a couple of days later. He gave me 20 euro after checking the purse, I hadn'ttouched anything apart from looking at her phone how to get it to her.🙏🏾🌹.
That was nice of him and her also for giving him reward 🥰
Hope she gives him another reward when he turns 18 🙂
What a stud; great job!!!
What an incredible young man. I’m sure his mama is so proud. ❤
Such a nice kid!! He deserved the kindness in return!! 🙌
That kid is totally great and welcoming. 💯 ✊️
That's beautiful I'm so proud of this young man ! Gives me faith that there still some kind hearted people around . His mom did a wonderful job raising him
Now take some of that 3K and buy a belt...
He saw her pretty face and was trying to shoot his shot
Bro decided to do the gta mission
Kudo's to the guy's mom, she raised him well.
Wow!  He was raised right!  Upstanding young man. Makes me happy there is still good people, especially young people in this world.
Plot twist: The kid saved all credit cards informations and wanted to return the purse so the credit cards don’t get cancelled.
❤️❤️❤️
Well, that man is definitely getting laid lol
Wow such a good kid! So sad though that I’ve been trying to do go fund me all kinds of fundraisers for my baby girls cancer and never made anything.
This guy got famous by returning a purse I respect that
Wonder what she would have paid to lick her feet
This is how you raise and instill in them 🙌🏼🙏🏼😊😁👣🌱💛
Adrian is going to get blessed more than he ever thought it's probably going past $4000. Adrian your mom raised you good keep it going blessings Will keep coming.
He found nothing useful in the purse so he returned it in hope to get rewarded
A lady was nice enough to return my dropped wallet, I was so thankful she didn’t even want what I offered her. Still nice people out there
The sad thing is that now his face is out there he'll be bullied for being a decent human being...
Mara montolbano
Anybody bother to check if this story is real? Cuz you know the media never lies.
Good deeds don’t go unnoticed!
That Good teenager was raised Well. God bless him🙏
His mom raised a Knight in Shining Armor!! BRAVO BRAVO BRAVO !!!!🥰
Great job sir!
Im so proud of this young man. Definitely breeds hope for humanity and the future generation. Always do the right thing! 👏🏾🙏🏾👍
A book was written that is somewhat similar to the arc of this story. It’s called “Thank You, M'am” by Langston Hughes if anyone is curious.
What a good guy!
Wow! Thats going the extra mile. I found a purse in a target cart outside the store and was too scared to dig inside it so I just took it to customer service and left it with them. Hopefully the lady came back for it. Great on him driving it to their house. Nice job!
Smash
Honestly— to me, the main thing is about getting back my things. I’ve always said, I don’t even care if they take all the money in the wallet; just please bring back my ID and stuff. Once I had a weird kind of wallet that was really more like case you hold cards; there was an ex-partners business card in there (he’s an artist) and I was always sad I lost it. I think I may have accidentally thrown the whole thing in the trash. I did that with my old Nokia once. Had a bunch of stuff in my hands to throw away and I don’t even realize.
Broski dead ass ate like 3 chicken sandwich after getting 3k 😭....
Thank you, Adrian. Thank you to his mother!!!
im gonna start stealing purses and then returning them for free cash
Nice kid, did the right thing, Way to go kid.
*Slim Shady For Mayor!*
What a nice guy. ❤️😎
He opened up wallet up and saw her picture and thought this is a good way to start a conversation.. He got a lot more than just a conversation I could tell you that.. She is glowing! Lol
what a awesome story !
God bless that kid. His momma raised him right.
Adrian Rodriguez, SAY HIS NAME!!!
Yo Adrian! you're going places! keep it up young brother
He's 1 in a million for sure. Good deal. 👍
Yea, my son would do the same!
so lucky! i could buy an iphone w that money 😂
Nice to hear! Thank you Adrian and your mom too! God bless you!”
His mom did a great job raising. Respectful and courteous young man. I’m so glad he was rewarded! I would love to see more news about this than all of the bad stuff
Lol cholos have hearts lol
GOOD AH FOOOOO
U Best believe

Never judge a book by its cover because a lot of people would of thought different of him if they seen him walking 💯💯
people acting like he just saved somebody's life.
❤❤❤
So sweet!!!! God Bless him!!!! That was so nice!!! Amazing young man!!! Glad he was rewarded!!!!  This is a good example for youth! Great job mom!!!!! 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕

A young man of great character!!
I love this!!! His momma is a doing a wonderful job raising him! He gives me hope for the future! 👏🏼💕
bless the young man
In a few months when he turns 18 I'm sure he's going to get with one of those girls or both lmao
I was behind a car in a drive through a few months back and noticed a wallet on the bumper of the SUV in front of me. I got out and handed it to the driver but she didnt recognize it so i went home and got on FB and searched until i found the owner. Then i contacted them and met them to return it. The guy placed it on his aunts bumper while playing basketball with his cousin and forgot about it ! LOL
**ADRIAN RODRIGUEZ IS THE MAN** 💯❤
nice
Good job young man 😇❤🙏
He deserved it ,great kid 🙏
His mom should be so proud . What a great young man
In a time like today, this is such a beautiful story. That is a young man whose mother is probably so proud of him 👍
That's cool but you know damn well he was trying to get more then just cash lol .. girl is pretty lmao
Good kid 👏
What an awesome young man! His mama raised him right.
Adrian Rodriguez .... You made me cry out of joy!   Thanks also to everyone who shared to make sure that a good deed indeed doesn't go unrewarded! ❣️❣️❣️

I just donated $2,000.00 to the GoFundMe, this guy is a real hero, deserves all the money heading his way.  We need more people like him!
Makes me wonder what really was in that purse. Maybe some jewelry.
edgar ahh foo finally has money for weed and modelos
Great to hear good story like this from all the madness all over the world.
It speaks the truth, I would want my stuff returned too if I lost it.   Glad this guy did what he did.
He looks like he from da hood but looks can be deceiving😭
1 million views already. This is clearly what people want to hear about see. ❤️👍
Great character young man!!!
Need more good news like this please! God bless that young man! ❤️
Why was he not given a reward whilst at the door.
Very nice to see this, good parenting goes a long way my friends.

I would’ve went on a spending spree
Don’t ask for people like this be like them
My aunt did the same thing but the woman didn’t reward her anything like-
Is her friend trying so hard to makes Sofia Vergara accent?
SD living we the best 🤷🏻‍♀️💋
Doing the bare minimum can get you 3k?!?
his fit thoo... shi looks awesome
Now that's a real one. Not them punk kids running around doing crime.
you know the world is in a bad place when small acts of kindness like this gets praised a lot
Good job young man!
Thought the title was gonna say "then he gets sued"
Regaining my faith in humanity
Well done uso(brother) your honesty has paid dividends. 👏
Finally some positive news this made my show tty day so much better! Thank you young man for putting hope back in my heart that is here is still good people in this world!
Id hope he gets a free Scholarship !
Plot twist.... he stole the purse to begin with lol
“There’s hope for our younger generation.” Uh..yeah about that
Good kid
That was awsome well done young man you deserve everything you get.
True defintion of don't judge a book by its cover
Momma raised him well God bless this man
Plot Twist : He returned the purse because theres no valuable items inside so he returned it hoping to have some reward
There's Hope!!!.. Thank you Jesus 🙏
Few days later he ran up that credit card
Can’t judge a book by it cover
W cholos
Yeah I found a wallet with at least 50$ or so inside. I didn't really count it I just saw the 50. I needed to get my meds that day and I thought for a second that it was going to help me (I didn't have money at the time). But in the end I was thinking it wasn't right to take the money and instead I looked at the license and saw the lady lived at least 5 minutes from me and took it to her. She was so happy that it was returned, she was actually canceling all her credit cards as I knocked haha. She said the money was also for meds and she gave me a $20 for returning it.
he’s fineee
the young man is awesome 👌 👏👍
Such a great person, hope he goes far and stays kind :)
mama is proud <3 <3 <3
Tell Morena she needs to take less time tryin’ to look pretty and more time learnin’ English.
This man must be protected at all cost
My guy! Integrity. Your a winner.
Definitely need more good stories with happy endings like this🙏🏼
he prob looked in the wallet and saw the $20 and said "damn this person more broke than me"
Crazy how this even has to be on the news at all, do it regardless
Such a sweet and handsome young man
Glad to see there’s still good people with good humanity in this world
Kudos, Sir! A bright future is ahead of you.
whats his @
he looked in the purse and there was no cash.
Awesome young man
huge 🇼
Good people on both sides. 👏🏽
Dam she should’ve offered him something else
God bless this young man!
And again never judge a book by its cover. Other ppl will see him and base on his looks think the  worse  of him but is never good to judge, he has a good heart and was raised right. There still good people out there 🙏🙏
Prolly cause there wasn’t anything in the purse😂
Ohhh man i needed this story!! I love you Adrian! blessings all the way around😇
I hope his reward goes up to 10k
He’s such a good boy..
Plot twist: he actually  stole it and decided to give it back when there was no money in it.
Let's find out what lad he was breed in so we can send the rest there
Thank you for following your conscious.  If you have to ask  yourself, is my decision right or wrong? Typically it's wrong.. By doing the right thing  you'll not only feel better about your decision, karma  will reward you.
dude needs to learn his belt goes around his waist not under his butt
"...i want to turn Saudi Arabia into a gigantic infinite water concrete grass bush maze...  [...you mean...wait what?!...how?!...]  ...yes...Saudi Arabia...the whole thing..."
What a great kid. Saddest part is many ppl wouldn’t expect him to do something like that bc of how he looks. Bravo homie, makes me happy.
Kudos to the young man,but it’s kind sad that this is treated as a news nowadays, use to be a normal gesture in our society
Your mom raised a fine young man. The future is bright for you. Lead by example and do what’s always right.
Good hearted people, stand up n unite
Wow, it's so nice to hear good stories. 🙂
so many people do this for social media clicks. glad this kid did it out of the pure goodness of his heart.
That kid is too good, i wish him a great future
🫶🏻
Bull.   This is to make you think this happened.....
HE IS A REAL GREAT PERSON!
Oh god,🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄.....
As a child my dad told me the same thing, "always do the right thing even when nobody is looking."  He added, you're always watching your self!
It's sad that such honesty is a rare occurrence in the US. I've lived in Korea and have had my phone and my credit card returned to me when I lost them. I could also leave my valuables unattended in public spaces without getting stolen.
Good kid 👍🏻
This is y I love America
Beautiful
Pogchamp!
Props to him I would of stole it
USA: Omg you’re so special. Here is a 3k reward. Japan:……………
Real ass 1 aye lol .
Karma paid off 💰
0:08 How offensive, so she always thought we were hopeless?
We need more parents like this, God bless this family abundantly 🇿🇦
Wow
His mom raised him right
There’s hope in the world! Thank god👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
he’s so fine😭
Why she say grocery all weird lol
Do good deed an good things will come to u when u least expecting
hallelujah. so cute. God bless him.
What a sweet boy 🤱🏽
I love him and he has a wonderful mother who taught him good values and I am so happy to see others being grateful for his honesty
👏
what a guy
Yay!!! An honest, good kid. Does my heart good. Thank you to this awesome young man.
There… there is still faith in humanity.
i’ve done this before and didn’t get anything in return sadly and it was more then just 3 bands 😞and i’m still broke 😂
Love it
His momma and/or papa should be proud of him for doing the right thing, he looks like the stereotyped highschool cholos that does crazy things but he actually seems like he does good and nothing was stolen even if there was money it wasn't stolen
God bless him!and you ladies!
Good lad, He knows not to mess up with a Latina.
Good stuff man. Mad respect
Great Job
I love this story. It makes me feel happy God bless the boy And all of yall
💕💕 How sweet
Nobody wonder how this stories gets out theee to the news ? They will do anything for rating like faking stuff
This is great to see!
That's what you should do well deserved
🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
Give us more news like this one. I’m so tired of just getting news about horrible things.
I like how his outfit be like teenagers in early 2000.. such a good fashion taste and good heart kid..
You know what i bet these ladies will be blessed even more for being such compassionate ladies as well.
That was nice of him and it was good that she gave him something in return
Did the he right thing, what is so rare is that, it's more rare to find a kid who has been brought up properly!  😳
What a good kid, love that he did this expecting nothing in return.. but was rewarded. Bless him.
What a good thing to do! Makes me feel a little better about people!
good boy, good mama well done whanau
See what honesty gets u
Plot twist buddy seen how sexy the momma looked and thought ok let me just pull up on her 😂
Don't judge a book by its cover.
What a cool guy - and a cool mum for teaching him right.
The Gofundme is still up if anyone feels inclined to donate.
Imagine finding a purse & the lady rewarding him 3K. That’s awesome 🤍
Love this story!
❤️❤️❤️
👏👏👏👏
That’s my dawg fr 🤣🤣💯
Foos helping out the community
🙏 Finally, some good news
Don't judge a book by its cover
He is the type of dude who finishes all side missions in every GTA roles possible.
This is a real man!  Helping not hurting!
It doesn't matter what generation it is, there's good ppl out there like this. Just as much as there's selfish ppl who would just take it and leave. Some ppl in my family learned the hard way to not take lost money because karma always got to them (they lost money and then someone stole it). This guy is amazing for this tho, just shows he's a human with a good heart. Those 2 reasons he said why he did it is the correct way to think. I'm glad his mom raised him well like this, my mom always said the exact same thing to me growing up.
Latinos has a good heart
W kid
Awesome glad he got something other than be chivalrous in these times great example!
Amen 🙏🏽
I’m about to start my period cause I be in tears 😭 how sweet!!
Raised properly.That is the solution.Not blaming economic circumstances on criminal acts.
Great job .his mama teach him well .and he learn.well.
Is this... newsworthy? What's the norm then? Keeping it? Selling it?
Well, He didn't get the girl but 3 grand will help ease the pain.
Bro better have hit that she a 10 🤣
😍
Nice, wholesome video. Have a great day everyone!
Well done 👏 mate
This is nothing new or special in Japan. Shame it’s such a rare occurrence in this third world country called “America”.
Plot twist: He didn't find anything valuable to take, so he was like stuff it I might as well give it back lol.  But all jokes aside that was very kind of him. Good job bro, your mum must be very proud. 👍
This is so sweet we need more ppl like this! ❤️
Wow this is unreal 👏
I wish there was a link for the GoFundMe so I could donate! This sweet guy deserves it!
Good on Adrian! He deserves every bit of that reward money ☺️ he's out her setting examples
This is so sweet and warming 🙏🏼 God Bless 💜
His mom raised him right
Awesome! I wish everyone had parents that taught their kids to always try and do the right thing.
Just shows when you do nice things you get nice things back. Always give and never be greedy. Trust me it all works out in the end
What a good guy 🥰 nice to see this after all that’s going on in the world rn.❤️❤️
Damm those females bomb lol the left one 😍
Good kid and amazingly kind ladies.
This is such an awesome kid and I’m so proud of him for doing the right thing. His Mama raised him right and he did her proud!👍🏻 So glad that he got rewarded handsomely for it as well and hoping that other kids that see this follow his lead.🙏🏻❤️
Good job Adrian Rodriguez salute to you bro 💪
AWESOME YOUNG MAN ☺️
I'd take the girl's instead
So cute 😍
He was just raised by parents who taught him good morals.
Beautiful boy, may God protect him always.🙏🏻
I worked in a location where there was more than one organization on the premises that shared one restroom (with staff and clients).   While in a stall, I notice there was a wallet on  the toilet (These were old school toilets and yes it was more than two decades ago).  I looked in the wallet and looked at the ID, then I went to each office and asked if anyone lost a wallet.  The owner was so grateful that I returned the wallet.  She said or had her mortgage/rent payment in it.
That’s a cool dude right there. Props to that guy. 👍👍
I lost my wallet filled with cash (a few thousand) for moving to Germany at a car wash.  It was returned full.  My balls almost dropped off with shock.
His mom raised him well. Im glad he turned out a nice young man. I wish him well.
Good for you man. It’s nice to see news about good people.
I just returned a phone. The guy was in shock. Since his whole life was logged in.
Good to see a person do a good deed
Good on you!
Good will always win. Yet the bad cannot understand kindness. Made impact
Instead of saying that we need more people like him, WE, should be like him.
GREAT PARENTING
Lucky he found some rich chicks
I did this once and all I got was a thank you and the door closed. Hahaha should have kept the 1k I found in the wallet
Cutie and a sweetie
What an awesome young man!!!
This made me choke up. There has been so much ugly these last years. Humans not so great. But just this one touched some hearts.
I hope he passes on his wisdom to others..
Something similar happened to my mom, a group of teenage boys drove to multiple cities trying to find our address to return my moms purse
Good job young man! You have so much potential!
Good job I would do the same thing
You also do t have to give large rewards for kindness like this either!! Anything goes a long ways!!
Good job mate💪🏾
Great job
👏🏼👏🏼♥️
That was very sweet of him, that is a good amount of money for returning a purse back.
*there is hope for another generation*
Respect
What a fine young man, no what a fine man.
I hope the kid sees this video, sees the comments and becomes a light to other kids his age by continuing to be a kind soul in a cruel world.
Definitely say alot of his character and how he was raised. Fine young man.
Now I wish we had more people like him! But no. We just have only a few good people still
I found a really  expensive ring at work and turned it in. The help desk where I dropped it off took my name down and the lady called me at work. She said she had a reward for me and I was like okay, here is my address. I expected like $50. I got a check in the mail for $350 dollars.  What a blessing that was because  I was homeless living in a shelter. That helped me get a bus  pass to keep working! Doing the right thing pays off guys. Bravo to you young man.
His Mother raised him so well. God Bless his Mom and him 🥹❤️🙏🏼
NOICEEEEE  xD
He fine😭😭😍😍😍😝😝
Nice what a legend
ratio
Good man!!
Both of you should of tag teamed him.
The go fund me is almost at $7,000 only 7 hours after this video was posted. I think it's going to go much higher 😁
Good work by the 17 yr old boy… he’s reason to do something good even if no one knows is a very valid point. Do good without needing reward or praise. Love this 👍🏻
good man💪
I'd just take a date with either of them
I need a translator for that dark haired lady lolol
There is hope!
This man is a true American 🇺🇸 citizen.
He must have fantastic parents!! My big hug to his mom and dad for raising him so well.
His mother must be proud there is still hope for younger gen
God bless you young man!!!!❤️🙏❤️🙏
Great job, young man! Outstanding!🙏🏼❤️
Lol. This Sureño gang banger is a rare one!
Is that a green screen Telfar? 🥹🧐
Good choice; good job son. Bless you 😃👏👏👏
I loved that!...  He's an exceptional young man... and deserves that $3K pat on the back! Bravo to him for doing the right thing... and "kudos" to Mama for raising a wonderful young man...
what is his go fund me page? would like to donate.
AMEN. MAY GOD BLESS THAT YOUNG MAN. YOUNG AND FULL OF INTEGRITY.
man I do this like every other day and am not on news as the main event
Man love this dude only if there was more man 😕😕
I lost my wife wallet like last week and no one has returned the wallet. Glad that there’s young adults doing the right thing.
I got to get a shout out to that 17-year-old parents he was raised right.
Also... dont judge a book by its cover many people would see this kid and call him a delinquent
God bless you young man 🙏
Great job 👏🏾
He's a good looking kid too
Colombian lady probably married a guy for citizenship and divorced after lol
"And that's kid how i met your mom"
All the people saying we need more people like him, Be the person like him first
This is the world I grew up in.
Good on this young man. And his mom who raised him well.  Good deeds do pay off!
Exactly and what a nice young man!💕
We don’t claim any of this energy ✝️✝️✝️
Congratulations Adrian. I don't know you but I'm still very proud of you. I'm sure your family is bursting with pride. Was more than happy to donate to the GoFundMe account. Hopefully it'll come in handy for college. Thank you for being a role model my dude.
that's unusual
We need more of this positive news in the mainstream media
Wouldn’t say there’s hope for this generation 💀
Yay
I had someone turn in a wallet with 2k in it to me as a bartender. All of us at the bar tracked down the guy on social media and he came down to pick it up the next day. It was his and his roommates rent $$. He bought the bar some drinks and gave a ver generous tip. It made me feel awesome that all of my regulars were such great people. That much cash can do bad things to people
Awesome young man, lovely ladies 💙
I wish people would think how they’d feel if it happened to them. I could never take what’s not mine
Wow A brown person did something nice. Make this day for a national holiday.
man i wish i had someone like that. one time i lost my wallet with 300$ in it, it was returned but with no money inside lol
Something that was casual 20 years ago has become something very irregular
what a great example of a gentleman
That has happened to me at stop and shop during last winter with my rent still inside and some returned it in full to me
Finally a decent reward for doing something good. I’m sick of seeing purses and wallets worth thousands each being returned and then only rewarding $100. Like wtf… anyway good for him tho
Good news, I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word (Jesus) and believes him who sent me (God) has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life. John 5:24 Please think about it, believe&repent of sin today! Don't be left behind, Jesus died for you. Believe before the rapture. Love
We need more people like him. He has a good mother.
God bless him.🙏🙏🙏
Wow amazing....nice ending
Good for him! Finally seeing a story about someone making good choices in life….even if just one. One will lead into another and then another, so on and so forth! 🥰
Dude coulda found a few dollars and some lipstick instead he found 3k :'D
God bless this young man 🙏🙏
It’s because she’s good looking
Man I got to start returning these purses I find!
But when i return a lady wallet i found  in the park she tried to press charges on me for stealing💀. Im glad to see someone greatful on this situation. I should have left it for someone else to really steal
🙏🙏💙🥰
What a kind young man.  He has to have wonderful parents.  So wonderful !! 💜😎.  If only every young person was like him !!
Wow amazing you man
Love that! An amazing young man and a wonderful woman to reward him❤️❤️✨🌷🙏🏼👑
That's awesome!
❤❤👍👍
I know which neighborhood that is I grew up in San Diego but had to move for military
Young man go do great things you have a god calling
Naw I'm convinced the woman was ready for the young bull 😆 🤣 😂
There is still hope in humanity 👏👏
If they did that for me I donate to some children's charity I wouldn't keep that money
What a valuable lesson
👊💪💯🇲🇽🙏
wow never saw a picture of his mom and yet i know she is beautiful
We need more news like this
Way to go young man.  May God bless your life.
We need more good news like this... His parents did a great Job
I love eliana lol I’d took it back to lol
Somebody raising that boy right!
We need more people like this teenager God Bless🙏
Awesome
AND he’s Hispanic that’s wassup, ✊🏽💯
That is how human kind should be and he dresses like a straight g from the hood I'm proud to even see that
Big ups to the young man! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
This makes me feel good
coulda got a 1 mil reward but 3k is cool
Good story
What a kind person and news I want to see :)
That kid was an angel actually.
Good for him!!! I hope his character stays the same. Blessings
This is good to hear given that teens was shooting at each other in my neighborhood yesterday🙂.
my husband dropped his wallet once. it had over 3000 cash in it. at midnight we got a knock on the door. he opened it and I was hidden behind him with the shotgun. it was our downstairs neighbor. he told him to count to make sure no one took any money. he refused the 100 dollars we offered. ever since then, when I see the lonely elderly man I stop and talk with him. about anything and everything. he did something unbelievably kind so I go out of my way to make him feel seen and heard. kindness costs nothing, and everyone benefits from it
His momma taught him well❤️
“There’s hope for this generation” Well there’s hope for……some people
This is why I still have hope for humanity.
What a great young man. I’m glad his mom brought him up the correct way. I wish blessings and prosperity for that young man👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Nice to see something like this today.   🙌🏼   Good job!
my guess, he saw the id picture, thought would get a little tail.
Good Man ..! 👍
Thats wussup
Pay your gratitude forward to another as ive done and hopefully the others as well. If not your just selfish and self centered.
She should've invited him inside the house for a free nude lap dance.
Honest I wouldn’t take the money just doing a good deed
He was raised properly
WOW I WOULD BE SO PROUD IF THAT WAS MY SON
Adrian Rodriguez followed the 2 best rules for life : #1-Do the Right thing  #2-Do unto others as would would have them do unto you. Thank you Adrian! You have given me hope for the future!
It's pretty bad that everyone is so impressed by this. Have you really never done anything to help another person? I've returned more than one lost wallet and thought nothing of it.  I mean, good on him but this shouldn't be so shocking.
I found a woman's wallet, house and car keys in a small case outside Walgreens. A few feet from where addicts were asking people for money. Filled with cash and credit cards. Looked at her license photo and found her in the store. She didn't even say thank you! 😄 Maybe she was shocked. I would not accept a reward.
It was faked. They just scammed 3k out of the public. Source: his Snap
Why did this make me cry I hope my son does the same
HAHAHJAJAJAHAHAAH PLEASEWE CIRCLE VIEW APARTMENT
I'm a doctor of prostitution
Doctor of prostatition
If only we could all just look out for eachother like this kid. So many problems would be solved. Look out for people rather than try to harm them in some way.
I'm a doctor
God bless this young man for doing the right thing he is what I call a hero.
How u like this. I didn't
Love to see it especially in Cali
Circle view apartment we good now gtfo
A resident doctor and she STILL ABLE TO LIVE ON WILLAIM STREET
Suzanne kirk is a doctor christine quinn
I'm glad he was rewarded.
This should not be on the news this should be a normal thing but in reality it's not this a sad world.
👍🙏👍
Great man!
Adrian was raised right!  God Bless him!
OUTSTANDING ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I hate how young people use Botox to feel better. Homegirl without it looks better.
It's all in the name Adrian it's a very powerful name
She’s a nice lady and also to the very good young man I’m gonna say you’ve earned my respect tonight thank you for doing the right thing
He was raised right! God bless him! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
thats ma ninga
He returned the purse because there was  nothing inside the purse except the driving licence,a sanitary pads,a pack of condom,a lipstick and a pregnancy test kit, and a smelly inner wear which he sniff for an hour before showing up at her door ....... He like sniffing the panties......
I would love to be a fly on the wall to see his face when he was given that money.
I will raise my boy like this.
Oh no I lost my purse too…👀
Dam u got 3k to hand out dam shawty u a mild let me be papi sancho
Awesome
He deserves it
This is what we all should do... Great job Young man. Your mom thought u well
Hallelujah! There is hope for our youth! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 What a great kid! I think he's going to make it in life with his attitude. 🙂🇨🇦✌
Not alot of people like him
He was raised proper. thank God kids still have decent parents to instill good morals.
outstanding & upstanding young gentleman :
Exactly good parenting
Finally, some good news!
Me: holds on to a 20 dollar bill a regular customer said they lost. Two weeks later gives it back. Gets to keep 5 dollars.   Remember you always want good karma!! Don’t take the money- bleachers  I live by this song.  Always give the money. You’ll be rewarded whether you see it or not, you will know in the end it was worth it. Even to see that person smile. You helped someone.
God is great this still good people out there
Good boy, Good parents.
This is a man right here! God bless you kid.
what a fine, upstanding young man, cute too, and i mean that in a non-creepy way, of course!!! i will pray for all involved in this awesome story! God Bless!!!!!!!
Respite from all the negativity in the news! 😇
Doing good should be it's own reward. ..that said...we should all pitch in,  &  send this good kid to college, or tech school,  buy him a car, or a vacation with his wonderful Mom....some good Karma to help him along his journey...♡☆♡
Him the day before  "we bad today"  Him seeing the purse: "we good today"
Awesome job young man! You give me some hope for our future as a nation! 💯💯💯💯
I'd go rain and storm if I knew she was the owner
Bro had different plans when he saw her driver license
We Mexicans need more of this media image, I am donating this is technically me let me reward this vato ..
Lost my wallet in my university library before with $800 cash in it. It was returned to the lost and found but what was left was my id. 😅 wish this guy picked it up for me.
He a gentleman and he fine asf
This is the kind of news I want on my feed, MORE POSITIVITY! ❤️
I am absent minded and have lost my wallet  a few times.....every time it's been returned to me, with everything intact! Gives me hope!
Good for all parties involved! I found a wallet in the parking lot of my apartment bldg. I realized it was my neighbor’s so I had my bf go over and return while I finished walking the dogs. Apparently there was $9000 in there! Wow!! I wouldn’t of taken it anyways and neither of us thought to open it past the Id insert. They were so surprised but hey… you put Good in, you get Good out 🤗
Never judge a book bye its cover this dude looks kinda like a g and still is a nice dude😎
Yup! I work with 19 young kids and theyr all motivated and trustworthy! There is hope
I’ve lost my wallet twice and both times I filed a police report to report a lost wallet and both times someone turned it in with all of my money and cards in it. Absolutely mind blowing that ppl out there like this exist but they definitely do.   Word of advice! If you lose your wallet file a police report with your local police department, you might get lucky like I did.
I thought when i saw the thumbnail  That it was the thief returning the purse 🤣  I was wrong.
A man with integrity is refreshing ❤️
This how people in America should be. Not guns and nonsense killing. My prayers for the teen to be blessed with good deeds so he can teach his children, children in the future time. Bravo kid 👏🏻👏🏻
You know this foo looked at the ID and knew this was he chance to SHOOT his shot😭
Good job young man.
good :D
Bruh thats not a good dude, he's tryina smash. I bet my life if that wallet belonged to a dude or a nasty chick the money would be spent before they even finished reading the ID
Damnnnnn, I would've just be like "just give me your number" 😍🤣
That's awesome 😎
I look forward to these little sweet good-news stories. They make such a difference! Thank you 🥰
I found a girls wallet that was laying by a pine tree, like someone tossed it out a window, it had her California ID, some cash and a zipper with alot of change in it, I took it to the local police dept, so hopefully she got it back.
He was trying to smash
Integrity! Wow. Good stuff. Usually, it's good as gone!
Last time i did this with a dudes wallet he said "shoulda kept it"
Abosulitely stupid… if that is not the way most or all are…F… them…
AWWWWW... We all need to be like him😄
Great kid no smashing and grabbing like you know who get mad truth hurts
this restore my faith in humanity
Doing the right thing always gets you blessing. Great kid raised by his mom. 👋
You can tell he was raised right.  Kudos to this young man.
More like Eliana Martel lmao from GOT
Ok but he’s cute 😍😍
There's people who will find your things & give it back to you, there's people who will leave it there, there's people who will give it to someone else like lost & found, & there's people who will keep it & do what ever with it .  It's a good thing that he took it back to them, but it's not shocking because people do good things everyday .  Glad he did give it back & he deserves the money 😀😀😀
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love seeing kind acts like this around the world ❤❤ This young man was raised well.
Wow!!! What a great guy.
Good on ya kid.
Someone actually did this for me. I left my wallet at the park and the guy actually came to my house to give it back to me. Like this cat, he used my ID to find me. I offered him the only $5 bucks I had in that same wallet but he refused.   Stuff like that you never forget and it makes you appreciate people.
Pretty sure if there was $3,700 in that purse you would not have ever seen it again.
What an awesome young man ! God will bless you.
What a sweet heart ❤️  He probably  Hess her I'd and was hoping for a chance   She's beautiful 😍
Love this! This what I always tell my son!
I hope he is doing good
He’s so cute😭
I love this story. This young mans' mom did a great job of raising him! My mom used to tell us the same thing...always do the right thing, especially when no one is watching! This is the type of person we need to grow up and run for president.
Good guy
This foo boutta have the sickest smoke sesh with the homies 😶‍🌫️
See what happens when you're honest and true? You get rewarded!
It all starts with good parenting.  ...and Good Karma, it goes a long way.
Good job Mom, you raised him. He is a hero!!!!
“Fine” young man. He’s about to get more than 3K.
It takes nothing away from you to do the right thing.
He’s trying to smash low key
I did this one, a lady dropped her ID when I worked at amazon..Amazon... I drove after work to her house in Palos Verdes and they gave me 20 bucks. Always return what is lost.
What a Awesome Guy! Great Job!!!
lol maybe he can hollar back at her in a couple years to get a more personal reward, jokes aside a good deed landed 3k in his pockets good for him.
Manyee, shout out to my real hustlers. Always be honest & God sees your heart. Thus, God did in this situation. 😎😇🇺🇸
Shout out to this young man's mother she did a great job 👏 👍
Maybe he’s born with it. Maybe it’s Maybelline.
I would just ask for her instead of the money
My uncle once said, With less waist comes with size 34 pants.
Something similar happened once and it turned out to be a scam…
At least there a good kid, who learn from good lessons from a great parent. Always return things to choose the right path & not the wrong path to be a sinner.  Always a good things & return 😌. Like the old saying: "what's goes around, comes around"!  He should get a rewards what he did, especially for his family 👪. That suddenly did a good deeds, I will do that as well. If someone return my things without stealing it☺
God bless you,brother
bro was jus tryna get down wit a milf
We need more people like him in this world
For a second I thought I saw Peter Parker's aunt.
What a nice young man. Very principled.
What a great story!
More of this please!🙏🙏🙏🤍🤍🤍
I’m going to start giving back all the wallets and purses I find.
i found a wallet when i was out delivering at my old job and the guy wasn't even home lmao so i left it under his door mat
Good for the kid, really I tip my hat to him.  BUT isn't it ashame that by doing something as simple as returning someones property gets national news..  that lets you know how aweful society is.
San Diego has hope
💜💜💜😢🙏  he was most definitely raised right 👏👏👏👏👏 may he continues to be blessed
This is a wonderful story not to many people return a purse . He was reworded he never expected money but got it. This is a really great story I would love to hear alot more stories like this. 💯❤️❤️❤️❤️💙💙💙💙💙
Good young man 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
he fine too
Love 💞 this..
Awesome Sauce and Cool Beans story! A Great young man! His Mom must be proud and his grandmother’s super proud!
We need to focus more on people like this instead of giving attention to people who weren’t raised right
Inside editions got views 😃  Lady got her purse back 😃  Young man got cash 😃  Police got 😒
But still has her car keys and phone. Yeah ok.
Damm i love her accent mamasita
What a great young man! 🙏🏻❤️
you being shocked by honesty, shocks me, where do you live, in the ghetto
Forgot my wallet in the bathroom at work one morning which had $600 in it that I borrowed from the boss.  I realized at lunchtime where I left it,  but it was gone. I knew who would have taken it but could not prove it. I wish they would have just taken the money and left the wallet. Replacing ID and cards is a lot of work.
Idk who raised him. Maybe he taught himself sh** but damn that’s a man who has my endless respect
Gatenteed in a bad situation he would get stereotyped…. Not knowing he’s a good kid
Wow but when I took this girls purse 👜 and returned her social security / med card and ID im the bad guy where's my Inside edition episode
He was raised well. Good job to his mom for raising such a sweet young man.
I hope he stays safe especially with all that money i hope no one tries any bad intentions
He got some cat probably
Good for the kid, he was raised proper
Finally some positivity on the internet
If you raise your kid/s right, they will do good things or they will do less mistakes in their life...
very rare gem...his parents raised a good son with character..nice to see this.
That's an honorable young man. I'm sure he did it for the right reasons and not expecting to be blessed for doing the right thing. This makes me happy.
God bless him
Good young man his mother raised him properly for any young lady this would be a very good young man to have in your life or at least to meet
Let’s be real… dude went through he purse. Seen her I’d and thought maybe I could smash lolol
Godbless u young man 😊🙏
I’m proud of you Adrian. Congratulations to your parents!
What a sweet young man. I wish more men were just like him! The world would be a whole lot better!!!!
Hope this guy and his story inspires people to do the same. If only kidness was contagious!
It’s a kind thing to do, but I wish we lived in a world where doing this is normal. Where it’s the opposite of this that gets a story on the news.
ADRIAN THE GOAT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love stories like this! Just all around good people being GOOD people! 🫶🏻💫
HE WAS FINE HOLLUP TELL HIM RETURN MY PURSE
🤎🤎🤎🤎
Man is all set up
Oh bless his heart 🙏🏽❤️
3k!????? Thats insane! Its tragic that he got that much
here in America doing the right thing is shocking to everyone🫠🫠🫠
He was raised right by his parents ☺🙏... We need more people like him
He saw the us and hoped he’d get more then some bread
thats hope
This is the best thing I have seen all week! What about you?
i was once working landscaping found a wallet in a parking lot went inside the offices and turned it in, guy comes out and thanks the receptionist and didnt even bother to look at me, racist pos lol
He cute
He cute
FINALLY A GOOD ACT TO ADD SOME REDEMPTION TO THIS HORRIBLE GENERATION
Good heart❤️ positive ❤️
This makes me incredibly happy! Integrity is a great virtue and this man has it!
Wow amazing thanks to this young man 🙏
He is gonna be very fine in a few years lol
Michelle Zamora loves puppets.
W vato
Good parenting trumps bad culture!…❤️❤️❤️
A light in darkness it’s also a testament to his parents
I remember my friends and I were at our local lake. My buddy dropped his phone at the dock. We dove to retrieve his phone and found another person’s phone which also had their ID. Of course the phone didn’t work, but alongside the ID, we drove to the girl’s house and gave her lost property back to her.
I lost my wallet at a flea market and I knew I would never see this again.  I had moved and my license had my old address, but luckily since it was being fixed and not sold immediately, I went by every day for a week or two to see if someone left it by the door or mailbox and I never found it. Then I got a letter from my local police department saying they had it and everything inside was still there. I had like 40 in cash, I would have been fine if they had taken it all. Not all hope in humanity is lost, be positive and if you find something, please try to return it! Thank you!
"There's hope" lol they act like the young generation ain't human.
Thank God for his Mom teaching him good moral standards that he has stood by! He surely is blessed ❤️
I love stories like this!
Wow wow that is fabulous such a positive young man thank you ladies for letting him know his good deed was very admirable and You’re such full of chivalry
yea there is no hope maybe like 20%
is that boi driving an audi
"I maybe a street tough but my momma raised me with morale."
Adrian ROCKS!!!
We need more news stories like this
I wish more good deeds were shown to the public. This is what I love to see. What a nice young man.
Bhh as woman ant give him 20 bucks
Well, this made my day brighter!!
No theft  can raise a kid like this. Proud of his parents
I have lost my wallet twice. (Foggy new mom brain) and got it back both times. I later found a wallet myself and returned it, missed my bus and the owner of the wallet gave me a ride home seeing me miss my bus. We talked on the way home,  exchanged contacts and became friends.
Good kid.
good job mom raising em right
Wonderful what he did!  Gives hope!  Wonderful what you did to raise him up for his good heart. 🙏❤️
This why I got the name adrian tatted on me
Ima start stealing purses and returning it in the condition I found it in. 😜
I love seeing this
His parents raising him right ❤️🙏🏽.
Yoo tone blo
Good people starts with Good parents
y’all remember the commercial with the cops and the donuts and a black eyed peas song in the back “where is the love” it’s giving very much that 💀💀😭
Awesome stuff!  I'm thankful for some good news and positivity 🙏 ✨ 🙌
Never judge a book by its cover. Well done, young man.
That's the way the world should be👍
Way to go mr Rodriguez
Bravo and well done!  This is the kind of news we need to gossip about! She would have spent way more than three grand trying to straighten out the mess identity theft can cause.
Ngl I would have preferred a night with the two of them instead of the cash
This is such a beautiful story!! What a fine and outstanding young man! He's going to do something amazing with his life that's for sure, and whoever ends up with this treasure will surely be one lucky lady! Not only handsome but a gentleman too. I'm so happy they raised all that money for him, he definitely deserved it!
I would have got the purse as a reward but that’s just me
An amazing young man who didn't stray from the Godly principles instilled by his mom!
I would do the same thing ,pay it forward
Good man
He was raised very well, God Bless him.
Nah he just wanted to meet the women ( and get laid )
I dont want the 3k  I Just would Like To be locked up with Them both for 3 days.....        Naked
All I can say is wow
Nice Hope God continue to bless You to the boy that returned the the purse
I've returned, a wallet and 3 cellphones.
Good job to you young man and to the mother of this child you both make the world a better place!
His parents must have raised him right! Good job young man
Wow.. super dope!!
A majority of teens nowadays wouldn't do things like this. God bless
Lol cmon now we all know damn well he saw how fine she was by the ID Pic and thought he would get a date
he fine fine
Amazing young man ! May the lord guide u always!
That is a fine young man! much respect to you, Sir!
Did he actually get that money tho?
its at 6k now, good for him!
he came to smash
Oh blah
One in a million!!!!
Oh wow
It’s over 6k now
What a wonderful uplifting story :) that mother raised her son well, I'm sure she's very proud of him!
W mans
Good, honest, kind deed!  God bless this young man!!🙏
What a wonderful young man
This guy did it right 👏 no cameras involved besides the doorbell, he acted out of kindness instead of clout chasing 🙏💙
There might still be hope
Very rare trait for this generation, glad we still had them hope more young people do the same thing.
Raised with good morals good job kid…
🙏🙏🙏❤️ My brotha you have given yourself good karma you will not be forgotten
He just wanted some puzzy... nah but for real this is heart warming 😢
This shouldn’t be on the news, this *should*just be something everyone should do, but nobody does. Mad respect to him!
He deserves every bit!!!! Not too many people left in the world that will choose to do the right thing.👏
Beautiful story, God bless this young man. ❤🙏
Beautiful! 🥰😢😁 Me and my wife always tell our kids "Even if it's the smallest thing......ALWAYS do what's right! " God bless in Jesus mighty name!
It's always nice to see good people being highlighted in the media.
I’m sure they gave him a little more then just money 😉.
I needed this positivity. Very happy for all involved, his mom taught him well & it shows 💖
AND HES FINE?!?😩😩❤️❤️
W mans
Over the years since I was young (about 1974 )  I have found & returned to owners a few purses and mobile phones in New Zealand + Australia . We were brought up to be honest with Bible values & so were our children & now Grandchildren
He was raised very well! His mother should be extremely proud of him!
Kindness goes a long way.
And the newly elected president of the Philippines Marcos, jr would not even admit that his father stole billions of the filipino nation's money.
Amazing young man!!! Mom's has taught you so well... You'll go far in life!! I love this ❤️
Well now everyone is watching. Good job, young man.
Don’t judge cholitos by their cover 😤
We need more people like this kid in the world!
That's how u be blessed when u do that right thing fam
And he fine
There's a lot more people in this world like this than you think, if I found a purse or wallet on the ground I'm only going to look to see who's it is and then I'm going to return it to them, I was raised the same way brother always do the right thing because you would want that done with you as well, I don't really believe in karma and I don't care if they give me a reward, I like being kind to other people making them happy that's where I become happy and have a sense of self pride for the moment I helped create and made someone very happy and surprised.  I've seen someone putting change in a machine and they only got a few dollars worth and that's all they had so I walked over and gave them the last 20 I had.
That's good character right there. Credit to him for doing the right thing, and excellent job to his parents.
i fully believe in karma. thats why im so respectful... We need more videos like this to stop people hating on our generation.
He will make the world around him a better place
This kid had a good father and mother for sure! Things like this aren’t taught in the streets it all begins at home. Bad ass kids you allow to be worthless will grow up to be bass worthless adults.
it’s always the attractive people
What a guy
The purse had no $$ in it. Maybe Pecos.
Raza doing good I love this ❤️💯
I'll bet his mama is proud of him, and that's what matters.  Good job, young man.
Good parenting. Good job kiddo 👌👍
His mother raised him right👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 good job to her
That's amazing! Great job young man!!
Heartwarming
Now that's gangsta
God bless this young man!
What an incredible young man! We need more parents like his in the world! This gives me hope!
He already looked rich tho 😂
Good job
Nice to see some good
He's a good man
He drives that Audi?
Good to see good and to not always see the bad
What a wonderful young man God bless him finally something good to hear❤️
This young man's parents raised him well. 👏
reasons why I would return something that's lost 1. If I lost something, I would want someone to bring it back to me cause I H8 losing things! 2. Bring comfort to the person who lost their stuff. 3. It ain't mine 4. idk
Dhar mann: Hmm... Content!,🌹😎
So cute 🥰
Cool dude! I would do the same thing. Nice to see people like this 😎🙏
Bruh, his mom raised him so damm well
imagine if he thought about stealing the purse but realized there was nothing valuable so he returned it to the owner..
Give him some tail! 😂 Jk but there is some hope for some of our youth
A VERY GOOD MAN.
Nvr judge a book by its cover
That comment about his mom saying “always do the right thing even when nobody is looking” brought me to tears 😭. Just when I’m ready to give up on people I hear a story like this. Bless this young man, his mother, the women who did the go fund me page and the people who donated.
He's a good son
Nice kid
Character very good character
whats even greater about this story is that the teen didn't "record" himself bragging online about this while doing what was right. props
This is like the side optional missions from GTA 5 where you give back a lady her stolen purse and then she rewards you big later on in the game.
God bless this teen. There's still hope for humanity.
World could be saved if all mothers be like his mother.
Originally when you look at this kid you automatically thing , bad, trouble, shaggy pants, but this is the perfect example of not judging a book by its cover… job well don’t sir! You deserve whatever the go fund me raises! Enjoy
How you forget yo purse
Blessings to that young man❤️
Good bless him💕
Choking back tears here.
His mother raised him right.
Loving stories like these!
Nice. and more younsters will follow behind what he did. It teaches people in general that the reward is actually the feeling of the grace upon another ones face, knowing that there is still hope for greatness
Absolutely integrity.  God Bless.
Did something similar and didn’t even get a thank you. Lmao
Thank God for good parents and their grwat children! 💕🌸🙏🌸
Something that happen every day in japan
I love love love this🥰🥰🥰Way to go young man! I applaud your mom for teaching you that wonderful way to be and you for applying it 😘🌸🌹💕🙏👍👍👍👍👍
good character for a young man, parents raised him the proper way.
👌👌👌
Bravo to him and his mother👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I love this🥰💖 Good people do exist!!
Doesn’t just speak about him but everyone else who pitched in to help him
This is awesome!!
Adrian, you're one of the good guys. Nuff respect to you! Great that they rewarded him so generously.👏👏
fake
🥲🥲🥲..Hope 😇
Super rare a woman appreciates something a man do and reward em. ✨️
Ive done that so many times! Its the right thing to do.
Nice young man! His parents should be proud. The Gofundme fundraiser they started has hit $6,026 now. He deserves it.
Yet when I do the right thing I get slapped with a restraining order.
I wish that was me. I returned a wallet to a man with $900.00 in it and he just looked through the wallet in front of me, as if I stole something and just said “Thanks”. I would have rejected any gratuity, but I do appreciate the gesture. These incidents happen to me so many times, that I stopped telling it to a friend, because she always condescends me by saying, “You’re too nice, I would keep it, all those times that happens to you “.
I love this so much ❤️🇦🇺
Good Boy❤
It's amazing how something like this can even make news. This is something that should just be automatic for all humanity.  This young man is doing things the right way.  By the way, you can also drop wallets, and purses off in those big blue mail boxes if you're unable to deliver it in person.  And what a nice thing that reward was. 💛
W
HOOOOOPPPPPPEEEEE
Well done
His mom raised him well! Thank you for being a honest gentleman! Blessings!
This is so nice of his mom to install good moral into 💕
Plot twist, the women made the GoFundMe and kept the money.   Jk but that would be pretty ironic.
congrats young man. Your family raised you well. The 3k is just the beginning of many blessings to come.
Awesome
He saw the picture on the driver's license and was like damn girl. That's why he returned it. 😍
That's her nephew
It speaks volumes for all of you!!
So just cause he’s Mexican it’s newsworthy he returned a purse lmao. Yeah wow! So crazy he did what anybody is supposed to do lol
Props to him, wish I could’ve donated!! Great character from such a young man ❤️
This is very nice of him, God bless his kind heart 💙
Its so nice hearing something like this for a change. If the world was more like this young man, it would be a happy and safer place.
In English it's called integrity
Imagine him bieng the one who stole it  too🕴️
He’s such a sweetheart 🌹💜🌹
This is real life "HI I AM JOHN QUINOŃES AND THIS IS WHAT WOULD YOU DO" Real life moment without the hollywood. Exceptional young Gent! Need more positive vibes over negatives.
One time me and my friend found a purse and we thought about taking it for ourselves but then we found diapers and we said to ourselves we can’t do harm to a mom idk it was a weird feeling so we took it back and jus left it at the door
He was raised property well done young man
Oh my gosh. This video is making me cry.
Cause he has a good mom…
Imagine all the others who never got anything and walked away happy that the right thing was done.
What a sweet story.
Great kid!
He is a future Republican, definitely not a Democrat.
I use to have a elderly coworker that found 80 grand in a Walmart parking lot. It was in a big envelope and she returned it to the manager. Some lady was looking for the envelope claiming it was for her husband, who was a soldier in Kuwait at the time. And they only gave my coworker like $100 lol. My ass would’ve probably taken it lol. But my luck some Cartel would be knocking at my door 😂😂
he’s so cute too!!
Wow ❤good kid ! I love his name that’s my son’s name
1:01 “Always do the right thing even when no one is watching.”Very good handsome man. 😍👏🏼😘
Great kid raised by a great mom!!!!
Homie bout to start trapping
🤍🤍
The younger homies different for sure because this money would have been lost in circulation had it been found by someone else 💯. O's up perrito!
"Always do the right thing Even whne no one's watching"
He is going to go far in life. 🙂🙂🙂 What a great story! 👏👏👏
What’s his @ lol
Da lady wit da purse should have rewarded him!!!
To Adrian may good fortune come to you.
Good parents raise good kids!
Sweet
This is so heartwarming, I needed this today!
Damn braski straight got doxxed.
WHY is this woman toting around large amounts of cash?????????
most times on Inside Edition when a teen shows up at someone's door, it ends up being a home invasion.  It was nice to see a happy ending for once.
They do exist!
Wow! Nobody does this now days. This should be in the news because it's shocking AF! Now days. Good people exist 👍
That's amazing man
Thank you for shining another good light on San Diego!
Obviously he has great parents!!!! 👍
This is the beautiful example of doing the right thing!.
I just always think how mad would I be if something like that happened. Ive returned 2 credit cards and it feels so good saving someone's time and eliminating stress.
He probably got more money from the reward than what was in the purse itself
This happens more then you think. I found someones wallet at DSHS here in Washington. Even while applying for food stamps because of rediclous gas prices. I turned it in. The people said they would contact the individual to make sure it was returned. You have no idea if someone is struggling and that might be their only life line. Care for others even if your struggling. Someone might have it worse. Good job brother. I'm proud of you. ❤️❤️❤️
If I would’ve saw that picture on the license, I would of returned it TOO!!😍😎
Put the teenager on TV!!!!
So nobody's gonna say it? I mean... he could have easily just gave it to a store manager with the same outcome. Homie was definitely trying to smash.
He’s a good 👍🏼 Man 👨 I wish all young men would be like him
Wow 17 and from California? This does give me some hope
Thats right. Do the right thing even when noone is watching 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Hardly hope... He driving a Audi.....
👍🏻👍🏻👏👏🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I love how he fits the mold of what society would deem as “sketchy” looking too.  Just goes to show you can’t judge the book by its color!!
There's hope in this country with the younger generation.
Not to be rude but with the way he's dressed i would have never thought he's this kind of a person.
Amazing 🤩 story this kid was definitely raised up with integrity… we need more honest people out there like him ….🥹
Shii😍😍 he’s fine asf
I found a tiny wallet which is more like a card holder that had a green card, some medical appointment cards, and a $20 bill in it on an NYC subway train. It belongs to an old Mexican lady and it took me a whole day to find the owner using social media and Google. I had to call her relatives with the same last name and finally found her address. Her grandson came to pick it up and offered some cash which I declined to receive. I'm always very happy to make others happy.
This is a great story! Wish there were more kids raised like him 🏆
Aww so sweet
That’s awesome!!! What an awesome story! It’s good to see stuff like this especially with all the craziness that we have happening these days!
Looks like a gang banger but does stuff like this ? Never judge a book by its cover !
I love him
I'd rather meet her than get the purse 😍😍
That jawline crazy
I bet you he was happy he identified himself also 😂  He can now lavish his mom with a nice purse 👜 for raising him right. 👏
He the one who stole it and got rewarded 😂😂😂😂
Good dude…wish more of us were like him…
He's a real one momy raised him right
Thank God for good parenting 🙏🙏🙏 God bless you young man and keep on doing it right all the time🙏🙏🙏
You're gonna go far, kid
That is a good young man. Raised right. Good job mom and dad.
Good shi big dawg
Awesome
Finally something that restores faith in the younger generation!  There's hope for humanity yet my friends
🙏🏼❤️ God Bless that man
Good people bring out the good in people
Good kid & I'm glad he was rewarded very generously. 🖒
Shot out and cheers to his Mother for a job well done on teaching him right from wrong,the world NEEDS more parents/guardians like this 👍🙏
beautiful story!
Black haired lady is a beaut
Great young man, all the best to him, this made me so happy 😊🙏✨
“Fine young man raised by parents right”🙀
any cop that saw him with that purse woulda arrested him
Such an awesome guy
Good job young man!
Omg this is so beautiful
I bet that bag was super expensive.
We need this kind of good news nowadays❤️❤️❤️
I found a IPhone 12 pro, dude called, we met ... He showed up with a 2o22 SUV and gave me 1o bucks  like I was a crack head, but God rewarded me 1 week later with a free 5o-inch 4K flat-screen
What does she mean by “There’s hope for our younger generations”!? Like she didn’t believe youngsters knows to do good? And she said it smilingly like there’s nothing wrong. It’s exactly this thinking that make younger generations lose hope!
Good samaritan depict that there is a bad one. Why do i always think about it😅
God bless his mom. This is a good upbringing. Train up a child in the way he should and when he grows, he will never depart from it. I pray he continues.
His mom would be so proud or should I say she is very proud. Finally a great story that doesn't pertain to violence or politics. I think we all needed this story. Cheers!!!
Your parents is very proud of you, young man. To the parents thank you for bringing him into this world. Good deeds comes great rewards from God.❤️🙏
When in USA this is rare
Whoever ends up with Adrian is one lucky lady (or dude, or both! no judging, escpecially for GRADE-A people like him <3 )
“Do unto others as you would have done unto you” even when no one is watching. Happy to see this young man living it out.
Good for him and his parents.
he could have taken a few hundred.. instead, he did the right thing and received 3k -- this literally just reinsured that, that  kid will always try to do the right thing from then on.
Karma...excellent job young man!
Smae thing happened to my mum and nice elderly gentlemen came back to give it to us he came by his bicycle and the supermarket where we lost it was far away as a show of gratitude we drove him back spent some time with his family it was very nice
We need more stories like this.  Outstanding job young man.  Your integrity is far beyond your age.  Your parents raised you right.
Golden Rule💯
That you you young man for being honest
Wow
Good guy!!!!
Good Job 👍🏻👍🏻
To the parents who raised that kid, thank you 🙏🏻
That young man probably would've settled for a kiss on the cheek from the Brunette lol
"Her friend" lol ..
Im sure we will find this out to be a scam in a few days
Fine man
This made my day better ❤️❤️
This is such a feel good story. Everyone ends up happy in the end and its certainly a lesson in honesty, integrity and immense kindness.
thats another proof of the  massive effect of good parenting =good generation
It’s the tiniest gestures that offer the biggest rewards. God bless him
What a good man.
We need this kind of people in this world.
There’s hope yet!!  His mother did a great job raising a man   Melissa Spayde
Don't judge a book by its cover can never be more true,, good job tocayo..
Should have asked for a date with the aunt as a reward.
I'm not saying you should be rewarded for doing a good thing but recognized for your attributes, that a good thing does not get overlooked
Faith in humanity restored 💪
Nice deed but believe it or not there was a time when people could do the right thing and not get thousands from GoFundMe. Sometimes its best to just let a nice deed be just that.
Good raising kid.god bless you
I once returned a purse at one university because i found  her library card in it but I was swarmed by these students and was blamed for it missing.. They kept asking for 300$ that was supposed to be in it, but I found it near the Arena's vending machine empty.. they even reported me to the police , since then I was traumatized to even touch somebody else's forgotten belongings
Goog job young man!   You a real one !
I have 5 boys and I raise then telling them the same thing. Always do the right thing specially when no one is looking. God bless the young man. What a kind heart. To think about how he would want to be treated in that situation and to do that for the person.
I love this 🤍
There is a great man 🥰
Good for him.  Well done young man.  Proud of you!!!🥰
Awe lil trouble kidds early days 🥹😂
this is a good young dude
Not gonna lie, I'd assume bad intentions based on the way he's dressed. Glad he's a good guy
👏🏼
Cool kid, I hope he does well in life.
Nice 👍 Yes there is hope 😉
I love this story! This is the stuff we should be watching 😀
Take notes kids!
Good story about simple goodness.
Thats pure intention, he didn't even record himself doing that like youtubers do.
I'm just wondering how she left her purse in the shopping cart at a grocery store 🔍
Such a sweet story. Sending love to all of you. 🤍
Very rude of her to check her bag. She should be thankful she got it back
The Golden rule.
Beautiful young man. His mother did an amazing job raising him❤
I'd find a wallet and go to return it only to be accused of stealing it
Cool Dude.
My mom would've made me take the reward back
Very good-hearted young man. I salute him and his parents.
Good on him....this just the way it should be. It shouldn't be "hope for the future" but I'll admit it's good to have good news but I think the media can do better than common courtesy.
Lol dude stole it then returned it. Classic move
Listen to your mother
this is against go fund me terms of service
More good in this world ❤️😊
Thank god there is hope for our future.
Great story 👏👏👏👏
It is hard fine young people like him . I hope they give all the money 💰 that they collected for the GO FUND ME .
I would have called the police to let them know that you were returning a purse you found, in case you got stopped by the police that way you're not accused of stealing. I'm saying this bcoz I don't trust them. Good things in the future for him.
Crazy that a good deed these days is so rare that it’s seen as someone kind of miracle or a shock. What he did was amazing but the fact that it’s seen as something strange and ridiculous is sad and a representation of how we view our society and country as a whole
stupid kid that purse is worth more he shoulda gone and re sold it
❤️❤️❤️
Massive W
A good foo
This is dope af 👌 really good example for the younger generations.
Hey dude I hope you see this!!! I’m sending you love and good vibes. You’re awesome and we literally do need more people like this. 😢
' Always do the right thing when no one is watching..'  I like that cause it's rare for anyone to do the right thing. Some just open, search whatever is valuable and just throw it away. Which is extremely sad. Cause all the things you have either purse, wallet or phone will be gone and no one won't have any remorse of it. Once it's gone, it's gone. So for him returning it is rare these days. So yeah, he does deserve the reward...
Bless him 😌
I was once overpaid 20hrs of overtime when I only worked 40hrs for one week. I decided to report it and was told I can keep it for being honest!
Let's get something straight here. The reason why the story made waves and made it on inside edition is because he looks like the very type of guy who would steal a purse. We _expect_  him to steal the purse. It's shocking to us that he didn't.
Aww hes so cute dressed like a thug and doing the right thing. Dont judge a book…… u know the rest
There's hope still for our youths in this f'd up world we live in
What a freaking sweet-heart. He obviously has great parents who taught him well.
Great teen, can tell about is personality, good job mamma 👏👍
Good for him.
That's awesome
We need more people like him 🙏🏼
Great guy great spirit, wish him the best in thefuture, this guys is going places
the fact that this made inside edition is sad, this should be happening all the time
That's great. God bless that young man in Jesus name!
In this economy...? That boy was raised the right way. I have a hard enough time affording a loaf of 🍞. 🙏👏👍
thts gr8 cheers to his parents 👏👏
🙋‍♂️👍⭐❤
There really is good people for real though
Plot twist they saw they made more than expect and ended up keeping the 3 grand
My older brother and I found a wallet at a mall when he was 18 and I was 15. He drove us to the owners home to return it and we were greeted by a senior citizen who couldn’t thank us enough. (It was his nephews wallet) He was so sweet and handed us caprisuns and we drank them as he was telling us how delighted he was to see a younger generation return a wallet 😊 It’s one of my favorite memories as a teen.
Good for that young man. Finally a good news💪. There’s hope it seems! God blessed him for that.
I'm going to start snatching people purse and have my brother bring it back. That's a viable business plan right there
His mama should be proud, she raised him well.
Bless him
Amazing god bless bro
And every one of yall mfs would ignore him if he asked for directions bc yall be judging hard asl by the way people look
Brava!
plot twist :  he was like I kinda thought the girl on the license was cute so also that's why I returned it lol   imagine
There's still some few good people in the 🌎 world
He must have an awesome Tio that taught him to play the game!!!!!! Too much hassle trying to sell a locked phone and after looking at her DL you know this kid was like maybe she has a hot daughter. Now he's getting laced up with stacks from gon fund me!!! WELL PLAYED MIJO, WELL PLAYED!!!!
He is so nice .. most people wouldn’t do what he do
Always act like it’s somebody watchin, cuz somebody always is! Big love to lil bro!!
found an iPhone once on the ground luckly wasnt locked called the husband met up with her and she didn't even say thank you she was just happy to find her phone I didnt expect anything just wanted her to say thanks
Props to the young man and his Mom!
20 blocks?
Good job!
Well done young man. If you ever have kids of your own then you'll be a Fantastic role model for them.
This world need more good peoples like this.
Wow there's hope for humanity 🙏
hes fine and a good guy oh lord
Believe In youth like no one is watching
W
God job young man.  Your Mom and Dad raised you right.
He probably looked at whatever photos the purse had and jerked off to them first before returning it. Nah just kidding. But seriously, it was nice that he went out of his way to look for the address just to return the purse to its owner.
This is the reassurance I needed today. 🥲🙌🏻
The proudness for her son that his mom must be feeling right now. 💜
Such a kind human.God bless u always.
Much respect lil bro
FINE YOUNG MAN. !!! 😍
What a great kid .. RAISED BY A GOOD MOTHER .... kids being great depends on the parents and surrounding people
Another feel good story that’s trying to scam people for their donations.
For every one guy like him there’s 20 stealing purses. There is no hope.
Good for him! A reminder tho don't just go out there doing good deeds expecting a reward. Must come from the heart like this kid who genuinely seemed concerned. 🙌🏼✨️ was he rewarded? yes ofc but he just happened to get rewarded.
Nice guy but like come on, national news and a $3000 reward for what is the normal thing to do in 90% or the world?
What a fine young gentleman!
THE WORLD IS RUN BY OLD PEOPLE
I bet he thought the aunt was a baddie and wanted to smash 😂
I always return lost items I find and so far everything I lost in public has been returned to me including my expense phone and air pods which today society it’s steal, but I’ve been having that luck of my stuff returning back when I return other lost items.
That's Nice I wish someone would of done that for me when I lost my purse :). We need more people like this
Need parents to teach like this.
Yeah right ! He looked and there wasn’t any cash in there ! 😂😂
Real
plot twist he was the one who stole it and there was no money in it
dude said the same thing the dude said when getting pulled over. (most honest man arrested)
He probably saw the license and was like, "Gotta see where this leads... MILF! MILF! MILF! MILF!" 😆  Good on the youngster. Sounds like his mom instilled integrity in him.
I was going to say, some good karma was coming his way but then I remembered he got $3K! 🤣
That a boy
Classy move young man! You proved your generation is worthy!
Should’ve just asked to smash the aunt 😆 😆
There’s no hope for our younger generation that’s one good deed how of millions chill
This made me teary. Kudos to your parents for raising you well. God bless you kid.
The lord sees all that happens. It's called Carma.
Awesome.  Good work young man.
Props to this guy right here. This is how you act like a man. He was raised on some great values that's for sure.💯👏
He looks like someone who would do the opposite but, the appearance doesnt matter, the inside does
how is no one talking about how fine he is🤷🏽‍♀️
Good job young man!!
that's fire bruh 🔥 🔥 🔥  👏 👏 👏
🙌 YASSSSSS GREAT JOB KING🤸‍♀️🤸‍♀️🤸‍♀️🤸‍♀️🤸‍♀️
Oh his mum must be so proud. What a beautiful young man.
this is what i like to see in this world class act to him bringing her stuff back god bless him and his family
I put a lost I'd card in the post office box I did the right thing too
🥰🥰
What a honest young man! Good for him!
There's a fine young man in the making 😃
Good kid definitely raised right!!
Dang man, why can't I ever get luck like this. Not just getting paid a reward for returning it but even just to get someone to return my stuff whenever I lost it. Because I have returned about 10 or 12 phones and maybe 6 or 8 purses and wallets and only got 5 bucks one time but I have lost my own stuff so many times and have only had it returned one time just because they new who I was.
PLEASE PIN his gofundme. Can potentially serve as a scholarship fund.
Wow he is really nice
We don’t need more people like him  We all have love in our hearts  We need to start acting like him
I found someone’s wallet at a self checkout and I tried to return it to the person but he was so cautious about opening the door and he thought I was setting him up for home invasion. He didn’t have a camera or anything he was talking through the door. He just told me to leave it at the front door. I got nothing out of it but it’s okay it was the right thing to do.
Good job representing your parents kid. They did a great job.
Eliana better have given bro some extra because she is fine as hell
He is great person
A teenage boy found a purse with that baddies face on the ID you bet he’s going to return it. Get that gawkgawk3000 my boy.
Integrity 🙏
Protect that kid at all cost. He was raised right! ♥️
He saw a nice address and would rather have made a rich friend than make a quick couple hundo.
Then got some la cha
Bravo to the young man who found it and the women and their family's who rewarded him for his kindness
What a wonderful gentleman!
Awesome  great guy good people he brought it back too 😀 👍 😄
Always take the high road, it’s never crowded.
His mom raised him right. Keep the attitude young man, you'll go far.
My brother found an iPhone 13 a couple months ago and gave it back to the owner..turned out it was a politician and the man wrote a letter to the company he was working in saying he was a very honest man
Need more kids like this. There is hope. !!
Lovely
Wow I'm surprised especially it's in California
3k is a lot of money, worth it honestly.
That’s me ☺️
No ladies. He thought the lady on the ID was seriously hot and wanted to meet the milfer. Straight up
I love his philosophy. Good guy. Good for him.
Mad props to this guy and his momma doing a great job. I know she is so proud.
This was a “win-win” for all involved!!! Way to go on passing on the kindness!!!💕
bro this man being a good man by returning stuff to people while im just here sitting my ass out 24 hours and doing nothing but watch videos
I love this!! What a sweet honest young man!! ❤👏🏻What a good young man his parents raised and who he chooses to be!! Im so glad he us being rewarded!!! He deserves it, and im sure he will put it towards something good!! I  This is the kind of young adult that will go far in life!! Best wishes to him and his family!! ❤👏🏻👍🏻 And this woman was incredibly kind to find him and reward snd thank him for doing the right thing!! ....as most people wouldnt sadly
There’s hope
i swear if he isn't gay...
Good lad ! Seeing this makes me happy.  I had my wallet mailed to me back in the 90's .  Wish i could have repaid whoever mailed it back to me. They didnt leave a address , just a note saying they found ot in a parking lot.
God Bless him.
"Fine Young Man" ayo
💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Great mom & even better teenage son for listening to your very wise mother.
🥰🫶👏👏👏 God bless you ❤️ young man!!!!!!
fake
🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌💯💯💯💯💯
He just wanted to meet the shawty from the I.D
Thank god he found it and a criminal glad that 17 year old had 17y got 3k
He's cute ngl. Good and cute, Mhnf! You can return my purse any day brother
Ahhhh good honest ppl 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Not worth posting
He answered "Their ain't no money in it"
That's all very interesting.
This is why I only judge people based on the content of their character.
I don't understand how he got $3000.?
There is still hope for this generation
a young man of morals and good character ❤
In the midst of so many sad news going around, hearing this kind of story is like a breath of fresh air!
🥰❤️🫶🏻🙌
Being a normal human being. Good for you! Take notes for those who would think of doing anything other than returning the found item.
Integrity,  well done, young man!!!
NOT ALL MEXICAN$ WITH TATTOO$ HAVE BAD INTENTION$, MO$T OF THEM COULD $AVE YOUR DAY 💪🏽😎
There is good people out there fantastic 👏 👍 👌 😀
This is awesome ❤ raise your kids to be decent people
Beautiful
This heal my heart ❤️ and made me cry. One of the beautiful lost and found case by nice young man. ⭐
California!
Oh I get it, 3K$ reward. The title says $3K, and at first I read $3X and thought they gave him a bl0wj0b for giving the purse back. Nevermind.
Now that's a man.. "do right even if no-one is watching".. yup. Way to go mom! You raised a Good one!
Great kid. It's sad that this has to be shown on TV as an example of how to treat others. Good for him.
Good job bud
Praise his parents they did the right job and he is a good man 👍👍👍👍👍👍
Pphart!!
isnt this normal for every people? what happened to the world?
Alot of females would love to have someone like him he earns my respect +++
At first i was like “wtf else would he do with it??” Then had to think and then i realised i was just a good person😭
Love this!!!  I think the best feeling in the world is returning something to someone that they thought they lost!! 🥰🥰🥰
I just know his mom felt the proudest when she sees this 😍
is this is not a normal thing in the U.S.? in Asia it does.
ALL YOU WIGGAS saying we need people like him. NO. YOUUUUU need to be like him
All I gotta say is  “My Man”  -Denzel Washington, American Gangster
What a good news
He must be a Republican!!
Good job dude!!!!
That bag is a Hermes Birkin worth around $15-30K. At least his donations is at $6K now.
"You don't see this type of thing everyday"
That’s so sweet!!
That’s what you call a class act. Bravo to this young man
Awesome parents! Awesome kid!
kid was raised right! good job to the kid and his parents!
Very kind! Was raised right :)
God bless him 🙏🏿
Atta boy!
“Theres hope for our younger generation” Thats one person and one good deed 😐
He was raised right!!.Good job❤️young man
There still is some good in this world 👏🏼
Thats awesome good kid
Never judge a book by its cover.
Funny thing is that some will "do the right thing" because they will believe their mind's cunning ideas that will suggest if you take the purse back maybe you will get $3000 instead of the $30 dollars you found in it. They will return the purse and probably get nothing in terms of money or fanfare. LMAO!! The human mind is funny like that. I doubt the young man thought anything about a reward as he stated that he would want someone to do the same for him if he had lost his things. That's the golden rule. It's not to get something out of it with the cunning idea of "what's in it for me" it is more selfless than that, thinking about helping someone else rather than thinking about about what's in it for you.   Don't let your left know what your right hand is doing. You take action like this without thinking about it, its down strictly from the heart and not allowing the ego-mind to make it about itself.
Glad they did not judge a book by its cover.
Its not in the children the problems of the world.
Plot twist.  The kid actually stole the purse and returned it out of guilt.
Good man great job it pays to be honest 👏 I'm happy he got a reward
I've returned so many purses phones and wallets it feels good when you hear thank you. No reward needed here.
I'm proud of this young man and we need more people like this in our world this day in time 🙏❤️👍!
Great young man,with God speed
There r good among us!
WOW !!! THANK YOU HIW AMAZING
Don't say we need more people like him, say we should be more like him.
Sooo glad this worked out and that they gave him a chance to explain what happened. Could have so easily called the police and have this whole situation turn out completely different. Bravo all the way around 🤗
4 grand for a 17 year old is like a million for adults. He deserves it!
It Strikes me how rare this is....perfect example of integrity & karma.
Fire
So wonderful thumbs UP for that teenager and his MOTHER.Thanks lady for Blessing that young Man
I returned someone's wallet full of credit cards no cash on the street once found a number and called it all I got was a  thankyou but was glad anyways they still got it returned to them
This goes to show, that there is still good people in the world, mom must be very proud of her son she is teaching this young man good things. Young man stay good in your heart an u will have a good life.. love from Canada ❤️
TREAT PEOPLE HOW YOU WANT TO BE TREATED
Oh my goodness  what a wonderful story to come across have a tiring day! Don’t get me wrong, I know the majority of good people do good deeds without even anticipating any type of reward or recognition….however, I do believe even the smallest reward (verbal and or physical) not only shows and reflects on one’s unexplainable gratitude when being on the receiving end of a good deed, but it can also possible inspire one to keep doing good…aka acknowledging the good in people, in whatever way is never a bad thing and we all need to do it more often :)
When I worked for Walmart in Tennessee as a cart pusher I found a purse in a cart and returned it to customer service. She came and found me later and gave me 20$ the look on her face is worth more then whatever was in that purse . She was so happy 😁
Standing ovation. 🙌👏
Need more people like that on this planet
what a good guy and great mom
💕💕💕
He was probably hoping to get some cheeks
You so awesome. 😘😘😘
Awesome story 👍🏽
It’s nice to hear but it just isn’t enough weight it’s so heavy I pray for all the good
Good Young Man. Very nice for People helping Him for His College Schorlarship Fund.
Lmao if one of those things that identify as the black it would of been gone with the cards ran up 😂😂.
He is indeed a very good young man raised by an amazing mother! 👏
That's what's up. 😎✌
There is a saying that if everyone did just one good deed each day can you imagine what the world would be like.
Was there a picture of the daughter in her bag by any chance 🤷‍♂️😝
Good news ☺️🥲🥲
👏👏👏👏
The kid has a great future.
Would it be better to give him cash? Bet IRS is going to want it's share some how
Returning the purse was the right thing to do. That's the only reason you need. He was raised right. God bless him.
i felt proud of Adrian myself , and i dont even know him  lol
what a nice guy! 😁 there should be more peope like this in the world!!
There be even more hope if older people would leave them the hell alone
god bless him amin.
he fine
He’s cutee
the fact that more people have not heard that phrase used is a little bit weird it's very common especially in the black community to hear that phrase do what's right even when nobody is looking!!! that should be common sense but sadly not 🥺
Instead of being corny and saying we need more people like him just do it. People always talk about good but never do good themselves
May God Bless that kid and may he grow to be an even better man.
Well done . He really found it in himself to do the right thing in this day and age . Kudous to this young man
W mans
It's called integrity; builds character. Good kid
eeef yoo found him I'll give you 20, but then I said, eeef yoo find him I'll give you.... 50!" Like ok bish what? 🤣
Kudos for his mom, she raised a great human being!
This world needs more of these people
Sweet kid. I love this. 🖤
i wouldve just taken it into the store
I would ask for 3 sum for reward
That's what happens when there's a good mother in the home .
I am having a not so good day, this made me smile. :)
Ur a real man bro!
Sooooo good!!
same kid to leave that house from returning the purse and get profiled cause the way he dreses. Im not saying this in a wack way im black lmaoo im just saying I wish the world realized the people who dress the way they want still have kind souls frfr
He was trying to hit
ruh roh raggy, these comments sound like what the npc says when you return their wallet in gta
Great story for a change
your a legend young man . hope your life is full of rewards mate .
Yes!
The owner must kept lots of cash in her purse because it valued $3,000. If someone returned my wallet which valued $100 cash, then I could only reward him 10%.
Integrity is an important character trait to have. I’m fortunate that my parents raised me to have it.
What a great kid..breath of fresh air...good job Mom💜🙏💜
WOW, this gives me hope for young people. Thank you young man for doing the right thing. I am so glad you were not a victim of, "No good deed goes unpunished." Thank you, ladies, as well!
Probably saw the ID and was "dam she's fine, let's go get a reward ".
Very admirable
Good job, Son. Keep your values throughout life, and you will always get it back 10 fold. Blessings!
Just more proof that raising children correctly is important. It's mostly parents fault that younger generation isn't growing up correctly.
Way to go! This is exactly why it’s so Important to do the right thing. One day it will come back around, spread the message. Please teach your kids. We would all live in a better world if we all look out for each other. ILL DO IT FOR YOU, please do it for me🤍
Shout out to The AMAZING MOM THAT IS RAISING A WONDERFUL YOUNG MAN...❤❤
What a fine, HONEST, upstanding young man. His agents may have raised him right however HE lone did the right thing! KUDOS from Canada to this outstanding young man.
I found a wallet that had a house key, driver's license, bank card and cash in it. Returned it and got 20 bucks. 🥰 Being good does pay and nice guys don't always finish last!
Finally a good story on the newd
Don’t judge a book by its cover, most people at first glance would judge him as a thug. But he’s such a nice young man, much better than the “good people” society wants us to believe.
That's my homie! Doing good deed rather than mass shooting to random person
So i was detailing this customers car and her royal richness left 5,000 underneath her floor mat n forgot it was there. I hide it from all the possibly spiritually wicked coworkers at that time n when the customer came, i gave it to her. It was ALL 100 BILLS. She was like oh thanks i forgot about that. Proceeds to dig in her purse n hands a 20 bill, not one of those 100 bills id found. Just One 20 dollar bill. Made me wish id kept it since she forgot it existed anyway n was a greedy witch but no way could i have lived with myself if i had kept it n i know i did the right thing n one day itll come back to me for doing whats right cus its Gods law that whatsoever a man seweth, that he shall also REAP.
Should it be this big of a deal tho? “A good deed” “there is hope in the world”. Everyone should naturally bring belongings back. I’m happy he did this but still ehh
Love that they help this 17 yr old boy off for college 3k is amazing college starter . Amazing dude people do exist ! Had about a few times people return my wallet full of cash and cards and my lv purse and iPhone back
He stole the purse.
One time my grandma had lost her wallet and she never noticed, there was a man who came and knocked at her house, she opened and he had asked if someone named Joseph live there and she said no, so he left and sat in his car and stayed in the driveway for quite sometime, at that point my grandma and grandpa thought he was someone bad so they called the police, they came and the man had told police he had a wallet he was trying to return but wasn't sure if it was the right address, but it turns out he had read the address street Joseph ln instead of my grandma's name which is why she got confused💀, after everything was sorted out my grandma thanked him and apologized about calling the police, we all had a good laugh after that lol
His ppls Raised him correctly
His parent raise him very well.
I returned a purse. Where's my $3K?

Never judge a book by its cover
And yet  people at my work  steal your monster out of the refrigerator  🤣
His parents should be very proud of him they have raised a good kid
Very cool 😎
Awesome sauce!
He was going to try and smash I see 👀
Step 1: Take Purse Step 2: Return it Step 3: Get free money
Yesss!!!
He's a good boy <3
I first read the title as they rewarded him with 63,000 lol
This young man was raised right! Great dude. Stellar.
Bruh we all know why he returned that purse
Well done young man
So awesome to see a positive story about a young person doing the right thing.
This is fake obviously lol it’s a sketch for clout lmfao
Thats a real G!.. Gentleman!
*He is like the title of Star Wars episode IV.*   🤗
Goes to show you can still be badass but be a good person in the process
That was beautiful
We know he was raised right....🙌🏽❤️🙏🏽
I found a WALLET with over 600 cash in it and I got it back to the owner in full
Amazing young man! We need men like him.
Oh wow that's sweet of him and the ladies
Adrian gives me hope in our dying society.
He's so attractive and has manors ❤️
So proud of you Adrian..
He deserves all the praise
Good job kid these 2 girls can get it if ya know what I mean.. 😉
Back in the day this was normal but our world has become so F’ckd up and now we praise any kind human act… it’s “kind” of ridiculous when you think about it.
I would’ve asked for the moms number instead of cash but ay good job homie
I would’ve came out with 50$😏
Sweet.
The world need people like him
Fool I would’ve stolen the money and spend it on real gold
This is so incredibly wholesome, need to hear more of this kind of news
Crying 😭. I wish more positive stories like this. I remember there’s a TV show in the morning in the morning on PBS station that just reports nothing but positive stories. Only briefly they’ll report on anything negative.
❤️
You’re a good dude! You’ll be going places.
I LOVE hearing this!!!! It's sad it's not more common, what a wonderful young man🙏❤️
should've let him clap
What a wonderful young man he is. Clearly been taught well by his mum.
Proves you can't judge a book by it's cover!!
One love & unity
No good deed goes unrewarded. I’m glad her purse didn’t fall into wrong hands.
Lmfao no wonder he saw her id was a chick and took it back I bet based off cus she was a girl
God Bless Him  JUNE 30, 2022
I’ve done things like this sooo many times but I been stolen from Sooo many times & beet out of money large &small.😢
Our politicians could learn a thing or two from him.
Character and a moral compas. Bravo!
Yeah staged for views. Next!
Thats a good guy. After all he could've kept it if he wanted to. I think he deserved the money
We need more people like that!
He was hoping to get some booty.
Honesty pays off, awesome youngster
Yeah I’ve returned things and alll they say is thank you lol
God bless you son   you will get through in life
Eliana got the biggest plastic face
I wish they interview him too
So if we make a go fund me for anything it’ll basically work???
Nice 👍🏽
That’s a stand up young man 👏
We need more good men like this!
Her "friend"
there is hope in the world. good man Adrian.
What a Chad.
Need more young men like him. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
My little brother once found a huge wad of cash outside a store and gave it to the manager. I’d like to think the person who lost it was able to get it from the managed, but my dad joked that the manager showed up to work the next day in Jordan’s lol
Wht he look like he off Bet?
He was tryn to get some definitely
Thank you to his mother for raising such a great son. Wishing this boy all the best. I salute you. 👏👏
Yes!!! Do the Right Thing!!!
What comes around goes around
No good deed goes unnoticed. Good job young man 👍
@foosgonewild
God bless you my friend
That's called integrity brother! Great job buddy 👍
Always do the right thing even if nobodys watching.     Love moms
I love this😊
+ Honor
Finally GOOD NEWS! Lets keep this going 🙏
This 17 year old is more honest than 99% of gov't, cheers to him, great guy.
His mom taught him well, and as he said, he would like someone to do the same if he had lost something of value. What an angel. 😃
I’m so grateful for stories like this!! You were raised right!!
He was casing the house’s security system for a return visit.
He’s fine
Mom did a good job raising that boy!
Your  mom did a excellent job. God bless you her.
Why’d i think it was a old lady purse?
We really need people like him. Trustworthy person 😁
Congrats on his parents that taught him morales
and he’s fine asl even better
Would you rather lose your wallet/ purse or cellphone?
Interesting how his teen outfit would've had people doing a double take. Yet he has a great heart. God bless him 🙏 We need more teen's like him.
You never know where God's blessings come from 🙏 God is good 🙏🙏🙏
He just earned his ticket to the palace
"Even when no one is watching." Great guy. Excellent.
No shade! But the bag  probably didn’t have any cash!!!
"Always do the right thing even if no one's watching" is probably the best thing I've ever heard he was raised well!
Hero
Bruh it was so weird when they said the name Adrian I was like bruh that’s my name
Also don’t judge by looks either foo did right thing
Bless you young man !!!
I wish more people were like this young man.
Awesome story
Why return the bag if you still gonna lose 3Gs lol jk
Love to hear good news
God bless this young man!!!! May all his dreams come true! The world needs more like him- ☺️💕🙏🏽
God bless you man Jesus will help you keep it positive brother
Raised right!!!
This is just wholesome.
“Always do the right thing even when nobody is watching” Im going to live by that for the rest of my life
This is the definition of dont judge a book by its cover since he looks like a hippie but he is a good-hearted person
Like this story. Good ppl still exist 😁😁
Omg sdgar?!}
Awesome!
Bravo young man!!!! I love this story! I'm so so happy he got an awesome reward too! What a good kid.
Not enough young men like him around.
he looks like a gangster too so its even more ironic
This give us hope
Good kid because i know for a fact i would've took the whole pure home emptied all of its content and sold the pure on offer up after everything was said and done lol
He was hoping for some cheeks
Just when I had started to lose help for these upcoming adults, here’s one doing an awesome upstanding thing! Fabulouso!!!
Nah I would have returned it with no money
It's honestly young man keep it up for life, God bless you and will love you more 😘 🙏 ❤ 💛 don't ever change bad, remember staying ❤ 💙 and honestly ❤ 💙 💖.
He was raised well. Great young man. 👏🏻
3K bruv
Amen!
LOVE IT! ❤️
I WOULD'VE TOOKEN IT... SHE SHOULD BE MORE RESPONSIBLE FOH
Sick
a daily incident in Singapore. lol.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ No words needed.  So happy to see this.  Thank you so much for sharing your experience about what this wonderful young man did.  Thank you to his Mother also.
Respect mon😎
Much respect salute 💯👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👌👍
“What goes around comes around” ❤️
Awesome 😎
Hope they give it all to him now lol or they end up on inside edition again
This is a Scam. Errrbody in on it. Dont be Fooled.
There is always been hope idk what shes talking about just common sense and respect each other not that hard
I dropped my wallet in the hotel parking lot on vacation with a $1000 in it and someone turned it in at the front desk but did not want to be identified.  It's been about 5 yrs now and I'm still so amazed and so grateful.
Love this!
This shows that there is a little more hope left in the world
She looks like a 52 yr old lizard with that wanna be Kardashian plastic surgery
Honest young man ! Not a their or smoocher great job Mom
Yeah right he saw the fine as girl on the ID and was trynna see wassup
Good Job young man🎉🎉🙏🙏💕 had me teary
You don’t have steal to earn a quick buck just find lost  items return it and you could be rewarded even bigger  all you have to do is just do the right thing .. rewards can be bigger than what you stole or find
he pulled up in the Audi, saw the ID and said IT'S ON! 😳😏😜
Raised the right way, he could have taken everything that was in that woman’s Lost Purse but did the good thing, ended up rewarded with 3 grand and this young man should be a role model to everybody to do the right thing!
That’s a good kid.
We need more people with morals like him
Low key he checked the address on maps and saw a reward in his future
Decided to raise a GoFundMe without knowing where he lives, 💀
Very nice young man
Very cool!
Instead of stealing it and getting thrown in jail like most youth his age nowadays, he did the right thing and got blessed ten fold.
This is why you dont judge a book by its cover
on a side note though, is that a kate spade? I love the colour.
👏👏👏👏
good dude
Just because it doesnt get reported in the news doesnt mean kids dont return things
Had this teen been black he would not have received anything but a bullet after the police were called to arrest him for ringing their doorbell and they would have accused him of casing the home to steal more valuables from 2 white women. He probably would have died while trying to explain himself which would've been seen as resisting arrest and therefore the punishment would have been instantaneous death.
Great kid great parents!. There IS hope for this world after all.
This gives me hope for the future generation…..because we only see the bad….it’s just so nice to see some good!!! God bless him! Good deeds bring Good karma
Dont judge people how they dress
Wow
What a sexy bloke
game recognize game, if there's nothing in the purse you return.
Now this is the type of news I love to hear about. Thank you inside for reporting this.
Absolute lad!
Why don’t you all post the go fund me link????????
Totally Awesome
I hope to raise my children to be this good and selfless 🙌🏼
Good for this young man. 👏
This young man was raised well by his Momma. He not only returned the purse, he went out of his way to find the owner. Most people who find stuff like that in a grocery store would just hand it over to the management or store security.
Proud and thanks to him for being honest. He mom rise him right.
Good job, Adrian! And nice reward ladies!
She gonna use the money in her purse on more face surgeries 😂
he stole it
See i bet a lot of people would judge him by his looks...i go further a lot of people would not open their door if they saw him on the doorbell cam...to thoose people screw you
There was nothing valuable in it 🤣🤣
His mother must be very proud of her son!!!
He's so sweet, good for him
I did this and the chicks boyfriend at the door was being a jerk I wish I just left the wallet in the parking lot. Wish it were people like them appreciate the fact I brought it to them.
its a scam
Hopefully they should still give 20$ dollars as a thank you for him!
😍
Human ❤️
I love happy stories!!!
God rewards those who do good deeds! Gods blessing to this young man!
he jus like me. Respect to this foo
Gives me hope during these crazy times. I just wanna go back to the way things were in the late 80s and early 90s.
He did the right thing no reward needed d9nate the money
Hats off to this boy and his parents who raised him well.
He definitely stole it
Plot twist. They all related. 👁
So Happy for this deserving kid! & kudos to these women for taking the time to reward him after not even knowing who he was.
Yes! I love this kind of news! Thank you, Adrian!
Love this
Pay  better   attention  to  where  you  put  down  ur  belongings...plus...c,mon   lady  who answered   the  door....could  u  not be  any  meanier,  not to think of a reward..urself...smh    wtf. At least   the  publuc....stepped up
This is so awesome what a great young man 🥰🥰
There is no hope
Good job! There is still hope!
Put God First and everything else will follow!!!
Losing your documents is the big problem - even license plates.
Adrian Rodrigues, Outstanding Work! You make me feel like there is still hope in Humanity, Million Thanks for it!!!!!!!!!!
It's a blessing to hear a story about a young man doing the right thing not about some kid who found a gun and shot himself or another person. Thank you young man for being a good honest person. God bless you always 🙏❤
This kid is an amazing person. Good job to him and his parent(s) for raising a fine lad
his mom must be so proud!
He did it for clout
I bet there was more and he just kept the rest to be famous over the internet.
That younq niqqa failed franks gta mission 💀
I've done something like this nothing special
Plot twist: he stole it in the first place
Never judge people by their appearance , bet most people here in the comments talk bad about people who dress like this just saying
1 points to men 0 to girls
oh he fine.
Me personally…
Man when I use to be in school I found this kids wallet with at least 1000 in it I returned it and this mf didn't even thank me I was really thinking about stealing that hoe I wish I did
He has a good heart ❤️
Ladies please stop putting your damn purse in the shopping kart.
I dropped a wallet at a Sprouts - Friday evening Las Vegas with $200 -  A young person turned it in to the 45 year old store manager who tried to keep it.
Thank God for him🙏🏾💕
Yessss 👍👍👍
💜💛💯
They some drunk asses
Yes only hope for those who were raised the right way
What an incredible young man.  You rock!!
Excellent young man
That young man is being raised right. I hope his family is proud!
I hope no girl ever gives him bad head.
That is great ❤️♥️♥️💕💕♥️
I love to hear these thing GOOD things love from Jamaica 🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
What a wonderful story and an empathetic young man. Thank you 🤔❤️🇺🇸
Good kid with morals! The future is still positive with people like this!!! All around good story!!!
What if there was a reward for it an there wasn’t money in it that why he brought it back but if he brought it back for the good reason may god bless him more
King
He could use the money to remove those "TaTs". He doesn't need them for reconnection anymore. He is loved.
Now this was NEWS great job young man  this man is a role model we need
What an amazing young man with an even more amazing mother! Wow.
Finally a video to make you feel good about the world instead of bad
What an amazing young man!  I also have an amazing child...a daughter. Hmmm...Maybe they could meet! Just sayin...
"Mom said do whats right...EVEN WHEN NO ONES LOOKING..." Oh!!! He made me cry!!!!!!
his paents raised him rigth....Good on u jason💯💯
His parents must be so proud ⭐️
Foos can be nice too
Love my fellow San diegans and good lookin, you will have a bright future kid, just stay outta trouble
We need more young adults to follow his example
Great story!!! So wonderful.
He looks like a “thug”, but has a heart of gold. We need to be more trike this guy!👆
W kid
Always Listen to Mom she definitely knows best 🙏🏽
I had this happen to me a man travelled all the way to my house to return
La raza
Wholesome story. This will stick with him forever
Cool that he ended up with a happy ending from those two. 😁
Good thing she didn't call the police
He done a good deed and he got rewarded
I'm happy he was rewarded for his integrity. This will inspire him and others to do better. God bless him.
Good job young man!
My son is not for you to return. He is not yours and never was. He is too good for you.
That’s a first
If you do good things, good things will happen to you!
Just always do the right thing
Very Nice Fellow.
This could've ended badly if someone else got to the purse first and stole the money.
Good dude. Raised right.
I did that for someone who dropped their wallet in Home Depot, drove it to her house.  It was a good feeling to see how relieved she was to get it back. Good job, young man.
This man will go places God bless him and his family
Hell yeah!
Hi
sounds fake
A good young man. He will make a good father one day ladies.
Lol
You're a good man!! I'm proud of you! Your mama taught you my life motto! ALWAYS do the right thing. It feels good! And to the ladies that raised money for him...I LOVE YOU!!!
Great example of the good in the world!
Adrian, you're really awesome 🥰😎👍. Job well done 👍✅ and God bless you.
BLESSED BE BELOVED young man!
All is not lost this guy is and should be a roll model
Ant I love her!
Good kid, not many like him these days
Make him famous!!!
That's integrity!! He's a good role model!!
What a great young man. We should all take a page out of his book!
Good story! Good people... everyone involved! Perfect ending!! 🙂🙂🙂
So the chick that lost the purse was confused? Didn’t even know her purse was gone? 😅  Idk I would have noticed that right away 🏃🏻‍♀️😐😂
that s was up Gee
Love it! ❤️
Everytime I go to the gas station hunter biden Steals my money
I've done that like 10 different times. its simply. its not yours to take... why else would I return it...
Wow rare!
He saw that picture Id of shawty and was like I gotta pull up😭
Shout out San Diego baby 619
Great kid
Even been all the negativity going on with the youth I still see videos every now and then that tells me there's Hope still left but this generation and this is one of them 👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
Dude will be a good father
My man.
Love this. They raised all that cash for him. That’s nice. I wish the kid who found that bag of cash the money truck left behind at the ATM had gotten a good reward instead of a mountain bike 🚵‍♀️ 😂😂😂😂Good job kid and thank you ladies.
he checked that drivers license photo and had to go😂
This goes to show that good kids come from GOOD PARENTS. Next time you see a kid doing something bad don’t blame the child, BLAME THE PARENT.
I Wish this young man all the good fortune and blessings in life that he deserves. Hopefully this story will inspire others to always do the right thing even when the only reward is you being able to feel good about doing a good deed. This young man did the right thing on his own and he was blessed for it . I applaud his mother for instilling the good character in him that led to him going out of his way to help someone other than himself. 👏👏
It’s always mom 😁
See even heroes dress ghetto yo!!! 👌🏼🤑
I found a wallet with money, creditcards, I dug out the address from the name, called the person and drove 10 miles to give it back, I did not even get a thanks, forget thanks not even a smile…
Bros got on 501s
The Moment i saw he was black i expected the title to go, 17 year old returns purse and gets shot bruh. This is the good ending
That foo ain’t dumb. I woulda taken the purse back after seeing the i.d. Haha
That’s a good kid. Props to the parents. They did parenting excellent. And the kid is an exceptional human being.
What was in the purse that would be of any use to him. Probably credit cards and makeup. Have him return with a purse with over $100,000 in it and then I'd be impressed. He was raised right though, I take my hat off to the parents.  This is more a testimony of how horrible this world has gotten to where we look at little acts of doing what's right and dubbing the person a saint.
Lovely story there still good people in this world😇❤
Speaks a lot about him and his family.❤️
someone pls lose their purse so  I can get 3k 🏃🏾‍♂️
I love this story! We need more good news coverage like this. Shoutout to him! 👏🏾❤️
He was raised right!!!!! The response with his mama’s name written all over it!
He has truly given me more hope for the younger generation.
“There’s hope for our younger generations!” Its comments like these that make me feel like there’s no hope for the older generations 😂🤦🏻‍♀️  like huh ? Great narcissistic way to start your thank you off 🤡
My uncle would just took the money my mom would give it back
We don’t need more people like him… WE need to be like him!
Good for him.
I got my purse back too twice actually but EMPTY😵‍💫
What a lovely honest young man
He fine
Thank you God for his wonderful mother that taught him well ❤️‍🩹
next vid, "kid gets mugged for his $3k purse return reward cash" jokes aside, we all know the right thing to do, its just too many people dont actually do it, but this kid does. Bravo to him and his parents.
I feel like he would be a nice friend.
That level of honor and integrity should be what we all strive for. Respect+ to him.
How Nice...
OMG I forgot my purse in the buggy after I left the store and when I got home I remembered I left my purse geez I'm so thankful no one took it. How can I add to support this young guy? Is there a go fund me?
The cholo who’s going to change the family’s history by making it big
Stick to news like this.
I wish i was that kid
What a guy such a sweetheart. God bless 🙏
San Diego next to mexico hmm People not realizing he just gave Back the cartel there Drug Money 🤣😂 LoL
I never struggle to do good bcoz I always try to put myself in the other person's shoes.
He bute
Lol ya'll know he was hoping for a tippy tipp for returning the purse. Wonder how he felt when he walked away empty handed. But glad he got something out of it anyway
This man is a Good Role Model to young generation of Americans..Salute to you sir..
Few heros left.
There is hope.
He was raised right ❤️
They should put down the wine for a while, brain cells you know
Another reason why you never judge a book by its cover! Well done lil homie 👏🏽
Setting a good example for la raza.
Aww good young man
Oh I got a reward for him 😏
This also shows don’t judge people for how they dress
He's the only honest person in California!!  Good on him
This young man should set an example for a lot of other young people
atta boy
Thanks mom🤗🥰
Good job 👏
God Bless Him ❤️
What a good boy! Bet his mama proud
The world must be horrible right now if this story is news🤷‍♂️
Awesome....going to be a great man...🥰
This is awesome!!
Thank goodness for Ring
Bro did a GTA side mission irl
If I was that kid, I would've asked for that spanish girls number instead of the bread.
Much respect for this honest person God gave us
You telling me my man’s pulled up waisted his time  and he ain’t got no ass for either or  of y’all damn speaks a lot about our society’s lmfao 🤣
Good kid 👍
Good work young man.
Kids a genius. He stole the purse, then when it was reported stolen with a reward  he cashed in.
What a wonderful child, well raised. It tells you that you can’t judge the book by its cover . Many would say he’s Hispanic, illegal alien , gang member.  Good job young man. So proud of you 💜💜💜💜
They forgot to mention that she had a ton of cash in her purse, over $2,000 dollars, he didint take a cent from her purse.
Good job to this young man and to his mom. 👍💕❤️
Oki kaayu
Is this news ?
What a great young man reminds me of how I was at that age
Wow I always say there’s more good people than bad ♥️
Respect ✊ blessings
I would've donated if I knew the go fund me
kid was brought up right. bravo mom!
I’ve returned some iPhones to their owners. One from a bar I was at and a lady forgot her phone because she was celebrating her daughter’s 21 birthday. They were drinking together. Anyways I contacted her from a Cheesecake Factory I was fixing tiles at and she came to pick it up. She offered me $20 dollars. I refused. By the way her phone had no password.  Some time after I was at another bar and my ride arrived to pick me up but forgot my iPhone on the counter. A customer sitting next to me ran after me and screamed that I left my cellphone. Karma at work.
How does this even become news? How effed up is the US if this is considered some heroic action. 😅 It's common sense and happens all the time where I live. Just last month I found a phone someone had forgotten at the gym late at night and after some detective work I found out who the owner was and he got it back the next day. I received zero cash for the deed, just how it should be.
Good mom good kid...congrats to the mom!
He was trying to meet her. Slick kid...saw that wallet picture and figured he'd pay her a visit. lol
Dripped out chad
Finally some GOOD NEWS. Great young man.
That made me cry ...☺️💕 .. HE IS AWESOME ❣️
Our society usually celebrates and rewards catch me outside people. Glad that young man did the right thing.
He's a good one!!!!
Man see's ID.. = "DAAAAAAMN!" .. would he have done this if she wasn't good looking?
I've always done this. Reward not needed.
Of course, now that they've posted his name and the amount all over the news, he definitely has to pay taxes on that 3.5k lol
That's a real man
I applaud Andrian for doing the right thing . He is a VERY special young man 👏👏👏👏👏👏
His parents raised the good young man you don't see no kids like that nowadays he's a blessing in disguise One Love
Plot twist: he took it
Shiet let me holla at Melina and we will call it good
3 kids in our school found a wallet full of cash on a school activity they brought it to school and school found the owners and they each got a 50 dollar gift card and a voucher for the school canteen
Your a good man keep up the good work. We need more people like you in this world.
This restored my hope in humanity
“Always do the right thing even when no one’s watching”. This is the one! So many people now help others only for the camera and clout they get
Put him on jail 😠
Good job kid 👍. Need more of you in the world
awh hes so kind for that
What race is he? Just asking 🏃🏽‍♂️
Let's be honest, we need ppl like this
It shows he was raised right. Great job! 👍
God is always watching. Salute
He is a great guy!
Oh, wow. I have found lots
Pretty much everyone on the planet would have either left it where they found it or kept the contents. The closest they would get to doing the right thing would be giving it to customer service at the place where they found it at, and they would forget they ever turned it into the store for the store to handle.   You expect an adult to teach a child how to act, but this is one case where a child taught adults how to act. If only everyone on the planet would do what he did.
These two ladies owe him big time. Might I say the favor be returned by rewarding the young honorable man with hitting the cheeks for compensation when he turns 18. 🤪
If we were all like that this world would be perfect
👍🙏🙂
Oh thank God, good vibes this moment. Not always hate crime and karen. 🙏
What a sweetheart!!!
Great job young bro
Fine young man
Happened in San Diego County
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾❤❤❤💯
Good on this kid for doing the right thing. I just think it’s amazing how this has become such a rarity that it makes the news.
Thats wasssup..kid..god bless..stay down brownz
That is awesome 👏
That is so sweet!!! What a nice boy ❤️❤️
Doing the Right Thing, means helping those who cannot help themselves. Even if means gaining no recognition or reward.
Good man,either way. Props..
Honor, integrity, honesty, respect and kindness. All able be taught.
When I was a child my dad found a briefcase with payroll for a company. He was asked do you know how much money is in here? there was more than $50,000 in cash and it was the payroll for 2 weeks for a small company. The owner of the brief case didn’t even say thank you to my 24 year old dad. He told me it’s okay always do what’s right. He said you know how many families would of been affected if it feel into the wrong hands! When I think back my parents were just starting off and we were broke. The police officers thanked my dad and even gave us a ride home. All the good karma helped us I’m sure!!
Now this is newsworthy!!! God bless this young man and may he be prosperous and abundant all his life😇
1:12 confused asf 🤣
THIS IS GREAT!!!
Good to see this. It gives me a little more faith in people.
God has blessed him !! ❤💖✝️💛
Good job young man 🙏
In today’s generation this young man is one in a million.
Touched my heart ❤️
Studious foo
Don’t judge a book by its cover.
This is amazing. Do good and good will come to you!
The aunt used that 20 to give him towards more botox
Praise God! Lord i pray you protect this little one always!!!
With so much goin on in the world it was a joy to watch this and see him be blessed for it.
Like what, the habit does not make the monk. I'm sure a lot of people would have thought he would be a delinquent from the way he dressed. It's a real social experience in addition to being young.
This is  such a refreshing story compared to the continues troubling news we get
That’s right Mijo 👍🏽
Yup good stuff. I returned someone’s phone today at the pool. I’m 37 but hey raised right
Nice young man remembering things his mom has told him. And treating people like he wants to be treated is the scripture in the Bible. Actually it's the Golden rule. (Matthew 7:12) 💖  It's nice to see stuff like this with the youth going so crazy now.
Good man right here we need more of our young generation to learn this and follow in his foot steps ....💯💪💯💪👍🙏💯
That's a really good young man and I'm glad they raised that money for him
aw he was just trynna hit lol thats why bro slid thru. lemme tell you lol still solid 3 bands tho, good 4 him and her
It's wonderful that he returned the purse. Not being a dick or anything but... isn't this a very normal thing to do? I'm from Japan so I don't know about America but just saying..
Never judge a book by its cover
This kid is awesome!
I applaud the teen and his parents.
I'm 17 and my name is Adrian 😂
Great kid. TY for being honest. Great parenting.
Awesome
Dont judge a book by its cover well said
$3000? Wow now he can afford gas and a Big Mac in California.
IF HE WOULD OF BEEN BLACK HE WOULD HAVE TOOK THE MONEY 💰 🤑 AND STOLE THE IDENTITY
it isn’t nothing in there so he returned it lol
Such a sweet, kind young man💙💙💙
Props to this young man and his mother.
Surprising for a black guy that he didnt steal it
Now here's how a good raised kid looks like with a good mindset. He thought that he wouldn't get possibly anything out of it, but he did. He got a bunch of money and respect. This is why doing the right thing always pays off.
That was so sweet! ❤️🕊️❤️🕊️❤️ God bless you all.
A well mannered young man who listened to his mother 💙 and absolutely went the right way Respect ✨😊
We need to see more of this
Damn. I woulda bought myself a nice phone or filled up my tank first lol
Allat surgery on her face🫣🫣🫣😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️
Good rewards come to good people that do good things for others! Good karma.
Perfect example of dont judge a book by its cover lets be real the way he looks how many would really answer the door or would you of talked thru the ring camera
Awesome
Kindness❤️❤️❤️
I hope to raise a kid as good as that one day good for him and his parents for raising him right
3k? thats nice and all but eliana better 🥴
Nice child  God continue to bless him and his wonderful parents that taught him right
Quintessential 💯🇺🇸🌹🌎🌍🌏
Something like this happened to my son. He lost his wallet at a gas station. And the man dropped it off at my home. I was shocked. But it would be surprising that a teen would bring it back!
No matter how he's parents raised him it's still  his choice to do right or wrong.
Amazing 🙏
Good job kid 👏🏼👏🏼
You do a good deed it comes back to you 10 folds….this is what good KARMA is.🙏🏼
Why didn't they just give him cash why make other people through go fund me
now THATS  real foo right there
What an amazing person & family!!.. she’s right speaks volumes about him & his family too🇨🇦♥️🇨🇦♥️
Not buying it..had no one answered the door he was robbing the place
What a great story!  Adrian, I'm very proud to hear of your story!  Your mom is a wonderful mom who raised you right!  I wish you much continued good fortune!  To the two ladies, thanks for bringing this story to us: We need lots of good news right about now!  I would be proud to have y'all as neighbors!  This made my week!
Such a great young man!
A son that remembers what his mom taught him . What a great kid!
Homie came up!!
Great,honest values good for this kid.
🤣😂
He's the real MVP!
God is alive and shall overcome
I would have just took some head tbh. 😂
He stole it returned it lol
Nice kid
Side mission fs
Thank you Jesus when I see stories like this it gives me hope
Really good kid with a really great mom.
I do stuff like this all the time but I never get any rewards..... Last time I found a phone i called a bunch of numbers on the phone, got in touch w/ someone and 4 people came threatening me saying I was involved in the assault, of course I had no idea WTF they was talking about but apparently someone broke into a house and beat up 3 people and stole all their stuff... I was unlucky enough to find the phone but luckily it was on surveillance camera and I didn't get any false charges.
He is right, Do what is right even when nobody is watching.
Awesome work Dude!!! “My mom always told me you do the right thing, even when no one is looking.” Props to him and HUGE props to his mom for raising a gentleman. And now he is 3k+ happier. 😁 Pretty sure he treated his mom to something nice 👍🏾
Thanks for making our people look good. Just cuz we're mexican doesn't mean we're bad.
Lil homie got heart 👍🏼
Awesome young man raised right. So refreshing in this day and age.
That's so nice off him
He only returned it cuz he looks financially stabled anybody else wooda stole it
I’m proud for him
💪💪💪😎
Awesome.. props young man
He looked at the drivers license and saw she was hot. No one is THAT nice.
A lot of people would see a young man like him ring their doorbell and ignore it/not answer. I'm so glad he is being rewarded for being a great person. There's not enough young people like this in the world today. His parents should be proud.
We need to see this. To have hope bc so many young have been doing elligal things.
Happy there’s ppl out there like this young man!
Some people would judge him for the clothes he wear or even just from his name but this goes to show you cant judge a book by its cover.
What a great kid
Dis foooo
Hes got the Smokey from Friday fit on
1 time I found a wallet  I try 2 return ut  3x the ppl at the house  never opened  the door (they were home) so I kept the wallet  🤔🤔🤣😭
Gta 5 lessons 👌
Man’s a legend
ok
I found 2 expensive iphones and one person didnt even thank me. I lt wasnt locked and I found there number in the phone
Sounds like he was hoping to get some booty.
thats what we call a W mans 🙏🏽
A 3 thousand dollar reward for simply doing a good deed. That's awesome! Much respect for this young man.🙌❤️
Damn that could have paid my rent for 3 months
We can all learn something from him.
Raised by a mother and father
Integrity is a good trait to have👍.
Yes this!!! Beautiful story in this crazy world we live in now a days
God bless this dude. 🙏
I like her aunt 😮‍💨
Great young man! Many his age would have stolen it, so good on him. His mother was wonderful in raising him!
The California teen did what his mom taught him.  He now knows over 3700 reasons why they call it the "Golden" rule.
He raised right
He went out of his way to do what was right! May the Lord bless him and his family 🙏🏼
Coolest way to get famous
It’s not worth it to steal man don’t ever do it
Never judge a book by it Cover.
i bet he saw the picture of the girl on his drivers license and wanted to meet her,  it's that simple
What a lovely story. There is still good people around us.
The gofundme is now up to almost $6k in donations! Well deserved!
The sentence “there is hope for the younger reneration” disgusted me so hard ow and yea there is no hope for the older ppl
Awesome 🌿
Ya know.... this could've been a great  pr0n setup... just look at the purse owner 😍😍😶
GJ!
excellent
Honest Foo
W
He is the best gangster he looks like one and if he is than he is genuinely the most kindest person.
The world could be saved if there were more people like this. all we need to do is look after each other and that would solve 99% of the world problems
All I'm getting from these news stories is anybody can set up a scenario like this with someone they know to get money from gullible people and be on the news.
bro said there's a hope for the younger generation 💀
God bless him
right on in so many ways.  thank God
AWESOME example of how Respect /Human Kindess.  Should  be taught  from. Early on!! ♥️💕🙏
Happy to hear good news. Good job. The best to him. Hooray
Thats me in the video. Well i checked it had no money felt bad thought maybe she was broke i ment to give her a 20$ bill haha
hope right there
damn he looks like my son im crying....
People going to start being honest now for money 💀
Holy smokes it’s White Boy Carl!
He was like she kinda look bad let me see if I get a phone number
Someone turned my wallet into the bank a long time ago   Since then i have found and returned two wallets !!! Karma does come around sometimes
He’s Hispanic too ay 😂🤌
3 band nd u kn fo a fact he hittin dat 😂
He a real one
There is a kind of people that is unique like him. And he is a great example of honesty and for me is amazing to watch great news like this he deserve the best of my blessings
Lol he was tryna bag her 😭😈
My dad always told me if you want to get laid by two hot Kruegers do the right thing. This kid is a G ! He knew what he was getting into when he returned that purse. Dad taught him well 😹
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Good job young man!
some hot ass TIAS lol
I saw something similar portrayed in Brazzers. The outcome was different tho
it's good to see some good in the world ❤ His momma taught him well!
I woulda took it
This is probably staged....plzzzz
This is nice
Nice
Being good parents does not guarantee having good kids. But it sure makes it a lot more likely! I don't have to guess that this kid has good parents
I would shake this MAN’S hand and throw him a party!
The kid followed the Golden Rule.....treat others as you'd want to be treated....
yaszzzzz 💜💜💜
Damn good dude and good people. I returned a purse before and all i got was a "thank you". It wasn't a nice thank you. As if she was upset because it was me and not some white knight.
His mother raised him well.
Beautiful person inside and out. Good for him.
That’s so awesome. Way to go young man.
So sad that doing the right thing is a news story nowadays!!
Great job Adrian, you’re a very honest young man.
Shame on some of the comments here that the young man stole the bag and returned just to get a reward WTFs wrong with you people!
Sadly what he did was risky but I’m so glad it turned out good. There is still hope for this generation. Good job. 😊
okay but did the money actually go to him?? remember the gofundme that was started for the homeless guy but the couple stole it lol.
Does anyone know what is the criteria for a godundme? cause I have a friend who would really appreciate one, he’s an old man lost his job during COVID and behind 2 months rent. I would love to surprise him.
Such a good dude :)
Awesome kid 👏🏼 💪🏼
Respect and blessings Young KING 👑
Good parenting really does go a long way. Nice young man right there!
Plot twist, that’s their nephew and they staged it to get a go fund me started
yooooooooo i will cashapp y'all 55 to tell me his snap or Instagram
I don't know what to say,if u want to thanks him,better go and search him by yourself,don't have to GoFundMe, someone will do something bad to him to get the money.This world is crazy and horrible.
Plot twist the guy stole the purse 👛 in the first place
Good job young man, good job.
🙌🏾 God bless him!
"We need more people like him"  *We need to be like him.*
Just amazing and awesome!!!
It all depends on how your brought up
Bravo young man
the fact that he left after giving back the purse without any compensation, silently just returning someone else's belongings when many would rather keep the contents, restores my faith. yes, he got 3k afterwards but that was not his intention and good for him.
That’s what’s up lil homie , much respect 🤘🏽
Best example of good parenting :) Good Job
So cool.
Next week, homeboy buy weeds for his friends with the 3k rewarded 🤣 ( jk)
Love this!
Must have had something special in that purse
So what respective lessons can be learnt from All of this.  Don't go around to other people's houses 🏠 you don't even know  It's criminal stalking besides, don't know what's lurking around there IT could be a trap for fools for anyone else knows
💎Homie got a cougar threesome😎 some steer thug gonna try and rob him now thanks those chains too ✌️
Beautiful
Great story!
Propers to the youngster... Thank you for bringing a bit of hope to humanity... DON'T CHANGE.
What I don’t get, is why is her friends driving license in her purse??
It must be saw ID 🪪 he likes her
Cardi b lookin ahh lol
If only the black community could be as upstanding like the Latin community.
Blessings to the little homey , It’s always the right time to do the right thing 💪🏾
When You turn in 10 million dollar Lost to Police 🚔 You Only get A Thank You Badge🚫
WOW, there is hope, for CA... how about that?!?
Great kid
God bless you young man.
ahhh he totally deserved it
What a sweetheart!! Blessings his way! Kindness will take him far! ❤️❤️❤️
That kids got a good heart definitely a rare thing in this world
I respect the women for rewarding him as well.
Some one found my husband's wallet in the parking lot and turned it in to the lost and found we were so greatful Good Job young man 👍
This young showed integrity and respect … well raised .. I just contributed to the go fund me .. I encourage others to do the same … reward him for his kindness.
Awesome story and wonderful young man! 💜💜💜Great to see how he listen so well to mom, great parenting skills MOM💜💜💜
anyone got his insta? 😍😍 (i’m also 17 so)
Good on you young man!
Always do the right even when no one is watching.
That young man was raised right.❤️
Amen
A good man! (However, in Japan, this isn't news; it's called normal behavior.)
This happens in Japan all the time  and it doesn't even make it to the social media, keep in mind America is more religious than Japan.
Someone should start a news channel like this. Report only the good and drastic world events
It's so refreshing to finally get some good news. Sending continuous blessings to that young man.  Doing  good will always come back to you .
Acts of kindness go a LONG way. If only everyone understood that.
This man is a genuine good people. This type of attitude is what is needed for humanity to achieve higher.   I miss seeing something like this in news sometimes. All i keep seeing is tragedy and bad stuff on the news, which is very sad. Way to go fellow young man.
$3000 reward??? There must've been something extremely valuable in that purse.
About time
May the Father bless him and his mom in The Lord Jesus Christ Almighty Name Amen.
He did it all for the nookie. Also, why is she using her friends drivers license?
good job kid!
Here's another reward.  He should have not looked inside the woman's wallet  in the first place. Should have just taken the purse to local law enforcement officers The employees in the police station premises Can sort it All out. It could have been stolen property for All anyone else knows
Good job Adrian!!!
No quema
Well done boy!
Love this 👏
Give him some cheeks too
This kid definitely gives me hope wow bless him
I LOVE IT 😭
The kind of parenting I'm aiming for 💜
He checked the ID and was like, damn right she’s fine ah. Jk jk jk he woulda returned it regardless, good looking out young man
i haven't seen something like this in a long time
Where's all those racist MAGA fans at now?
This is a great. It's nice to hear about good deeds. There's a lot of pettiness going on in this country. A lot of people making excuses for not having this or that. Petty theft has gone up. Good deeds is about not expecting anything for what you did. You do it because you want too. This kid is going to be successful. Good for him.
I don't know this young man from Adam, but my heart is bursting with love and pride for him and his mother! God bless him manifold!🤗👍💟
Homie took one look at the ID and showed up in his freshest fit
*It ALL begins from home!!*   *Plus good karma helps!*
Nice 👍
God blessed that man
it’s so cute how he’s holding it lol
Awesome
Very inspirational.  Thank you to the young man for doing the right thing
But..... Did he smash though? 👀
Give this young man everything.
Yet if the same kid was being portrayed as a “bad kid” y’all would fall right into line😂
Wonderful job young man. Keep up great honest work. Honesty is your best policy. Even if there wasn’t a monetary reward I would feel good inside knowing I did the right thing.
May God Bless him ten fold
There should be more black people like him.
Good for him. Great parenting right there. ❤
About a month ago in a parking lot I saw a lady getting into her car.  Right near where she parked the shopping cart I saw a black object on the ground (I was about 30 feet away).  I called out to the lady and asked if it was her package, pointing downward.  She followed my eyes and picked up the object - “oh my goodness that’s my purse!!! “ she yelled back.  I can see she was happy as she got back into the car and left.  I got no monetary reward, no camera crews, or even a grateful thank you.  So what did I do wrong?
This teen was raised right old school.
He was like damn let me return this purse 😏
Awesome kid with good parents. Glad to see this.
Awesome
Big up yuhself youth!!!! Shoutout from Trinidad 🇹🇹 . At a time when I feel like an alien on earth, this reassures me that I’m not the only one here. Respect ✊
I lost my wallet in a bus. It had about $400. I Didn’t care about the money at all. I had all the important cards in there. Some I was able to replace. Some not so lucky. I’ve always wish that the person who took it should have just taken the money and leave the wallet in the bus.
Found a wallet had 942$it was tuff goin at the time I struggled then I asked my kids they said keep it so I spent the next4 hours tracking this guy went to his house n handed it to him the look on his face priceless n I got 60 for gas
Finally, A worthy reward and an honest person
We should also give credits to her mom
I returned a couple of wallets, one was loaded with cash, I didn't get anything back in return
Someone give this very admirable young man a scholarship.
Wow! Unbelievable.
Definitely need a lot of good samaritans for helping their own people, and I am really proud of what that kid returned a lost purse to their rightful owners.
Always do right by others regardless of receiving an award or not.
Aww, such a gentleman.. he was raised right 👍
💕💕
What a good young man. Kudos to his wonderful mother.❤️
That is good to know that there is still good people out there.  Some people in your own household would steal from you, and lie about it.
Good man.. need more like him.  TAKE NOTE CALIFORNIA, OREGON, MICHIGAN, ILLINOIS and every other crime ridden state.
What a nice young man
Super rare….there’s not another 17 year old young man that would be this decent…
In most cases, this purse would be stolen. Thank god this man had the right spirit to return this purse to this woman
His mother did a good job, and he learned from her. That’s a great story…
Faith in humanity restored ❤️
Good job kid! This is a reward and lesson he will NEVER forget and he will pass that on down to his own kids one day! Even if a reward doesn’t come, he’ll remember how much that felt to do the right thing. But the reward seals the deal. So kudos to the family that raised money to reward him! And those whom gave to the reward finding! We should be rewarding those that do good in this evil world we live in.
Yay! I remember when i found a purse in a shopping cart when i was 24 years old. I drove 4 miles to give the purse to the owner and they told me i know what was in there, i said well good for you because i don't, i just got your ID and looked up your address to give it back. Good for this young men!
Nice job, hopefully, as you travel through life you will continue to realize that doing the right thing will never be wrong…
That's a good Samaritan kid.
My man has a good heart I appreciate the young guys putting a good example like this🤙🏽
Good parenting there folks.
And he fine
That was worth it than stealing it
That kid is a very rare breed.... Don't expect anything like that from most people.... like 96 percent of people probably would have kept it
WOW! This young man is an inspiration and is definitely going places! Obviously his mother is amazing as well and must have made that statement many times. She must be so proud!!
Wow. Look what good fortune he had for doing this.  Great job and glad you got a just reward.
He looks so cute standing there with that little purse in his hand! What a kind young man. I know his mom must be so proud of him.
I went to school with him
I would return it also.  The words of advice is:  Do unto others as you would others to do unto you.   Don't keep what's not yours, that's the virtue of honesty.   Unfortunately, society is not like that nowadays.  On the contrary, some intentionally steal what's not theirs.  Sad, actually.
We need more great stories like these. Thank you for sharing.
She’s also attractive I wonder if that was part of the motivation 😜 either way this is awesome
That's so freaking awesome!!! In the world we live in today. It's young men and women like him that give me hope in the younger generation coming into adulthood!!! God bless him
Always do the right thing even if no one is looking well said young man
Integrity
He saw her picture and was hoping to get some.
W
Official respect for this guy from Thanos.
love this
I've returned things numerous times and I'm lucky to get a thank you. WTF
I wish that was me
God Bless
Great guy 👍🏻
This young man is already becoming a great adult 💪😎
What a sweet kid 😍 ❤ ♥
He’s a star seed!!!
He wanted to smash… that’s why ;)
Props to this young man!
My mom told me to always do the right thing even if no one is watching! What a great young man and a wonderful Latina mom! Today I have a little more hope in my community :)
❣❣❣❣❣❣
What a gentleman!!! This is how we all should be!!! He needs to be the country's  role model!!"God Bless you sweetheart 💞💞💞
Same thing I  taught my children,   'always do the right thing, even if no one is watching ". "Be true to the absent".
Still hope in the world god bless and may he reward him by granting all he wishes ameen 🙏
That's wassup. Put a big ass smile on my face. He was raised correctly nd it shows. I hope my sons inspire to this level of greatness
Love a good story!
Be the good you want to see in the world 🌎 🙌😊
We need more young people like that in the world God bless you young man
That’s the right thing
I need to raise money for my daughters health bills. If someone can create a go fund me for this. I should be able to do it for health related concerns.
Mad respect to him ! Always judging us Latinos because we wear baggy clothes but this just shows you people still have hearts  and still care about doing the right thing  blessings his way Homie
And then some people say he looks like trouble because the way he is dressed but he's kind.
Well done young man 👏👏👏👏
Good parents raise good people.
Day made!! Great story. What a stand up young guy and kudos to his mom!!
He definitely had great roll models growing up. Need more parents like this, to teach kids to do the right thing.
I'm a dad with a 1 year old son and sometimes I just stare at him in fear of his future...especially with all the negative influences . It's been a ruff couple years I'm sure for all of us but  this video gives me hope.
Thats beautiful
Dam & looks can be deceiving, he looks like the type to steal your grill off your porch but he has good deeds good job🙌🏼
Dope👏
Awesome Bravo Young Man…… 👏👏👏
Great kid
His parents should be commended. They raised a very nice young man.
That's why you must not judge a person on how a person looks. Kudos to his parents for teaching their kids to be a good person.
This remind me of my dad when he was alive when i was 7 me amd dad went geocery shopping next to my da car  was a big purse   he dig in side to find an id which he fallow to that adress to give it back the lady hug him and ask for our number  the lady car the next day saying  the money still there  i dont know what they said on the phone but the lady  and her husband came by reward my dad 50 grand
Great kid
As the saying goes don’t judge a book by its cover!  RESPECT!!
Here, Here, new faith!!
Man thought it was a steam deck I hear there left in shopping carts in walmart
He was probably hoping to get kid tbh . I would
Good job a black dude didn't get his hands on it 👏
Top Lad for his honesty at this age! He will become a good man as he grows up!... God Bless! 🙏👍🏼
What a great young man!  🥰
If I had that 3k, Rent will be paid [3 months in advanced]. 😂
This truly newsworthy story is such a refreshing change of pace among all the heartbreaking & angering stories we’ve consistently been seeing/reading/hearing/watching in the news lately & in general.  *THANK YOU* for sharing this story & for everyone involved *ESPECIALLY* the young man! Well done to your parents for raising you to be the amazing & compassionate young man you’ve become!!!!!!!! 🙂❤️🥰
I applaud him what a great man . He deserves every penny
Usually Florida teen starts with a bad headline but this one has a different headline
Momma raised a good boy. I wish I had a mom like that. Props to that young man for being honest
What a good kid.
One for the brown✊🏾
He didn't return the purse just to be a upstanding citizen trust me.
Damn I wish I could find some purses to return haha. Good kid, I lm happy he was rewarded.
Thats a real man right there
That’s a good act for receiver either 👍👍👍
Ara la boi mijo
W jit
Look at him holding that purse. Hilarious.
Good work and some good news that I think a lot of us need to hear lately 😊
I love these types of videos. We need to show more positive things like this. What a fine young man!
Thank you to all Moms & Dads who raise their children this way!! “Train up a child in the way he should go..”
What a good good young man his Mama raised him right. I’m so happy you did the go fundraising for him my heart melts when a young person these  day’s do good things. ❤️
Smart Mom and great kid!
God Bless this young Man🙏🏽
He did for the fame
Wow,nice for him,enjoy your reward.
He found a purse in a shopping cart? Umm... she was probably just getting some groceries in another aisle when he took the purse lol.
Adrian, I hope you've got an older brother who can acknowledge your good deed, if I had a little brother and he did something like this I'd be so proud, this is the type of behavior that needs to be rewarded. Ima complete stranger yet I'd hug you if I could, cuz I'm so proud of you man!💯
What am talking about
Neat
It wasn't a good deed..it was just plain honest person period
That is great!! But God is always watching for sure!!🙏❤️🙏
Lmao breh
good job!!!!
man  glad to see good kid ! u  go bro.!
not the reward he wanted.
I did this in gta a few times too.
Wow super nice of him
Wonderful,. God bless this kid
Now thats good
Way to go!!
Wow this is amazing 👏🏻
Great 👍
He stole the bag, but returned it when he found nothing of value... 😂
It’s a sad day for society when doing the right thing makes news. Very good kid
Love it!!
Good kid!
Good job kid I hope you grow up to be a fine young man keep on leading by example!!!
What a blessing🙏❤
If your reading this young man,,, thank you for being kind and trustworthy ❤️😉🙏🏼
Does the woman with the lighter hair realize she has a goiter? Can someone e tell her?
🫡 respect!!!
He’s young, the world hasn’t turned him yet
He’s a good boy that was brought up right. I hope my kids would do the same in that situation. Well done kid 🙏🏻
It's cool that he returned it, but not every good deed deserves a GoFundMe. It sends the wrong message.
PAID college tuition or craftsperson training for  Adrienne
hope he is so proud of himself cuz that is a fine young man
Appreciate lil bro for doing that.
With that young man's mother said is key when no one is watching still do what is right 100%. So proud of this young man he deserves the reward God bless
God bless you bro 👍🏻
Bro like imagine if I just stole it I wouldn’t have made 3 bands😭😭😭
Homie looks like a lil ese just shows you can never judge a book by its cover, now besides all that them hynas ain't too bad looking 🔥🔥🔥
Wish more people especially teens were like this. You can tell this young man was raised right! And getting a massive reward like that is unbelievable! Very proud of him!
You love to see it !!! Lost my wallet downtown and had a very caring gentlemen tell me he drove bout an hour to get to me where i was working cause my old adresses owner told him where i worked.
🙏 Respect
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽...Alright Young man ...Good to see ...😃
So sad that our society rewards bad behavior, not good. Being a good person gets you nowhere in life. Glad he was rewarded.
He saw it was a pretty lady and decided to return it to their address he would of definitely kept my wallet 😏
Just note that it's a Hispanic person that's doing the right thing.
I know many kids like this
Nahhh he just seen her ID pic and was like danggg she fine, let me slide up to the crib  🤌🏼😎
He knew there would be a reward.  Just messin good job, kid.
I love everything about this clip however the best part is how the dude is holding the bag lol, like a typical youngster uncertain like it's so fragile lol cute man
We need more kids like him. He makes the world feel like a better place.
It pays to do Good Deeds!! God bless to the young man and the ladies
This is sad. It’s a big deal to do the right thing.
Good for him, a bright future ahead of him. Giving back goodness to the world!
Thaz her brother
I’m so happy for him but…… I could never give that money back 💀
Wow that's so awesome that he returned her purse. And even more wonderful that the money was raised. I sure hope he gets that money and does something good for him he deserves it.
Proud momma moment right there! 😊
How do you loose your entire purse?
Integrity
Momma raised this young man right!  She has got to be real proud of him after seeing this.  This kid has great things in his future.
God bless him morals and honesty
Renewes my hope in people! After hearing so much negative evil deeds that people do. I myself believe in Karma. Good job Lad. Very very few and far between in this day and age.
He was raised right! Such a nice young man
Good Kid
Respect Bro, Can't Judge a Book by It's Cover!!.. God Bless Him!!.. Thanks for Doing Right Thing. Role Model for Troubled Youth. ✌️
Pin?
I love this!! 💗
He’s dressed like early 2000-2005
That was nice of me Rodriguez
He is a Good Samaritan and the parents that raised him.. ❤❤❤ BIG RESPECT to this guy!
Enjoy that 3000$ taxes next tax year
Oh. All the good deeds I've done when nobody looks. Never got almost $4k! Or anything for that matter. Lol good to see there's goodness in the world still.
bro hes FINEEE
Great job cutie pie and thank you guys for rewarding him
Whats up with the karens and kens bringing up the way he is dressed? He looks like any other person from Cali/southwest. Is he suppose to be wearing slacks and a tie?
I truly believe there is good people out there , we just gravitate to the negative. Props to him & his family ❤️
Did the lady give him a little tuggy tug as a thank you?
Sweetheart. He deserves the acknowledgement. I hope people can learn from this.
What is is info? Venmo? Zelle?
Kudos to this kid and his family. A young man to be admired👍🙋
Aww, that's a nice story :)
he was trynna smash the chick on the license - & im telling you this from heart
Praise God!
Adrian Rodriguez, good man!
Absolutely love this type of news.
❤️
it's easy to do evil, it takes a strong soul to do good..
I would do the same
Sounds like a scam to me, GoFundMe my ass
Wow, nobody gives rewards after returning their purse or wallet, you just get accused of being the one to steal it.
This proves that there is good in this world:)
He only did that because he saw that Milf's ID and he thought she was hot 🔥
👍
pretty boy with an even prettier/pure soul😸
This is who we should all be like!!
Chingon
Excellent good young man
Praise God, he was raised right
Finally something to be happy about! :D
Good man💪
GOOD MANNNNNN
When you make good content like this at least give us a the opportunity to also donate with full details about the go fund me page so we can donate as well! What a wonderful man! ♥️
that young man is honorable.
i would do the same exact thing i swar...
Surprising that he got rewarded most people would thank you and then close the door
God bless him!
❤️
Some years ago, my mom found a lost purse maybe in a cart at a store. She found the address of the owner and returned the purse to her. The lady was grateful and gave my mom a burned CD that had songs of Cheyenne.
So much honesty, character, and integrity. He would make a terrible cop or politician.
This is what this younger generation needs to be like. Good job brother
💪🏻
it’s definitely weird when doing what you’re supposed to do turns into a big thing.  That just shows the times we’re living in.   Thata boy   The whole community is thankful that you have great parents who taught you well.   That’s where it all starts at home.  If young people have a bad home life they’ll imitate what they live in.  Thanks mother for raising a bright respectful young man that will go far in this life by following the golden rule.   Treat others the way you want to be treated if!   He answered the question well.
chad
Awesome feel good story.  Awesome dude.
What a great story and great kid
Positive happy  video This is what I would ENJOY WATCHING DAILY,..it's so gr8 to see people coming together & RESTORING HONESTY IN HUMANKIND 🫂♻️🤍🖤🤩
It’s sad we have to reward people for doing what should be done
Good man!
L!!! ever heard of finders keepers? 🤡
Not only did he return her lost purse but, he showed he is a wonderful young man! God Bless him and his family 👍👍👍👍👍
💕
Literally had a similar situation when I dropped my wallet coming out a store and didn't notice. When I realized I had lost my wallet I drove back and looked around bit couldn't find it...after a few mins of freaking out my mom calls me and says "lose something" :) turns out a gentleman in his 50s found it and brought back to my home where my mom was staying. Dude didn't  want anything and all he said was "we all have to look out for each other"
sus.. 🤔
Just think, he looks like a drug using junky loser but actually did a good thing, it's 1 of those don't judge a book by its cover things
A wonderful young man
He cute what his insta 👀 jk jkkk
Proud asf of him
Good job young man! Integerity means a lot these days!
Yay, good news! Blessings to this young man
Good thing he didn't give it to the Cops, they would have stolen it.
And by the way , this kid is a hero ,, 💖🥰🥰🥰
Not a lot of people will do that. But it’s a good thing he did what he did. He made a good choice.
Wish everyone like this but unfortunately it’s not this is why I hate people
Did not hear anyone credit this to, or give any thanks for the ultimate influencer of this type of behavior... JESUS CHRIST‼  at least not in this video, because...  SATAN! But y'all already know and feel the power of the Holy Spirit so let that sink into your subliminal.   Be BLESSED‼
So nice too see someone do the right thing for once. Mad respect for that dude.
Well done young man! Please join the Infantry, we need moral young men like you to lead the way!
Is a tweeker would of found that purse he would already be comiting fraud
Can someone tell this lady to go and check her thyroid,, please,, it looks big , my daughter in law had it like that ,,and had cancer in her thyroid,, she’s a cancer survivor thanks to her prompt medical seeking!!
Great kid 👏
Isn't that sad that when someone returns a purse without stealing anything it makes National News. Everyone should be raised this way.
Great kid! Gotta give props to the kids mom as well for teaching him to do the right thing!
He’s cute
That's a young man with a Great up bring
Good job, young man. 👍
yheaaaa he could’ve easily kept the pursee😭😭buutt he brought it backkk and there not alot of people like thatt he most definitely deserved thatt moneyyy😌😌😌
Bless his little heart. Its kinda sad that something so simple is now national news.
His Mama raised his right...good job Mama💞
Good for you bro❤️
Respect.
This why I hate stereotypes
This happened on an episode of Doug and even after the claim law time expired, he got to keep the money. Still insisted on returning. Then all get got was a stick of gum.
elian Martin looking like the Grinch lol
3k wow bless her heart 👏 🙏 some ppl would of just given 10$
Who’s gonna get his collage started?
it’s just so funny that if he was ugly no one would care and or be nice to him for what he did.
Perfect example that good deed comes with good reward well done keep it up!! 👍
We all need to be like him!!!
YES KING 🫶👏👏👏🫂
His karma debt is in the positives. Keep up the good work!!!
The homie bout to cop a fat sack
Raised right
still got some good people out there
I wonder how she even lost her purse
Very rare
That lady looks scary with that 💋  surgery  nasty her face structure  if all off
I guarantee he is a Trump supporter
WHAT A LEGEND!!!
Thats awesome
He was certainly raised well. I’m glad he got rewarded. Nice job young man.
♥️
.....Now that's a very decent honest young Man.... 1 in a million. And His Mom did a fine job of raising Him... This young Man is a Great Example for others to follow
What’s his Ig
They always say they returned it simply bc they would want someone else to return theirs, and this kids first reason was because it was simply RIGHT - not about good karma. It’s nice to hear a more honest reasoning. 💜🌷 see kids you can be cool AND honest lol honest is cool
he saw her license and said...ah yea imma return this
That was really sweet of him.🥺
Hope she at least let him get in 2 pumps
Beautiful
Karma You do good and good comes back to you
He found a bag gave it back and still got a bag
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You know, I bet he turns around and uses the reward to pay his family's rent. Not that he has to, but it wouldn't surprise me at all. This kid has a great heart, and I gotta praise his family for raising him right. Makes me love San Diego even more!
Love these positive stories!! That young man seriously needed a big pat on the back and his momma raised him right. Congratulations to him and to momma 😊
Lost my wallet once it was a Beatles Abby road wallet..a guy from Mexico found it, went back to his country and came back to return it wanting to do the right thing we gave him a 100 bucks I always wondered what he thought when he stared at the wallet
That angel face hero is a cutie.
What kinda purse that is gotta be one of them rapper bags they buy for they girl😂
Mission: Respect .....   Mission: Completed
Well his car says it all
His parents raised this kid well!!
not only he respectful but he fine asl too 😍 !!
Kinda a sad reflection of our societal state that good deeds reach the news because the bad has become the norm. Back in the day, news presented those who were in the wrong.
I had someone return my wallet when I dropped it without even knowing and they went the extra mile to message me online. I offered them thank you money but she refused any money. You don’t realize what a relief it is when someone found it
"When asked why he went out of his way to return the purse..."  Him: have you not seen the owner of that purse?!??
thats amazing good to hear there's still some good in this world
Good job kid, that’s why you never judge a book by its cover.
That was cool how he received a very nice reward
The teen is pimpin tho😤💪
What I would do to hear my children quote me like this one day 😭
What an excellent young man. His mom did a great job! 👍
Good kid.. good parents...good job
They should of gave him some bunz
💁🏿‍♀️👍🏿💯💜🙏🏿✌🏿
Plot twist: the man actually knew to return it so he would get 3K
Bro that's my brother🤣
That's awesome that he did that. So happy to know that there is still good kids out there
0:57 -- every person who does a good thing isn't a "good Samaritan." A good Samaritan is someone who puts themselves in danger to help someone else.
Why did he stole the purse 🙄
“For inside edition, I’m barrel batzelbono”
Hey
So there is hope for our young generation 👏🏽👏🏽 good job young man, your mom raised you right
Why is this going on the news... this is just a normal thing to do... right?.. right????
So did the ladies give him the money? Because I don't think they stated that they gave him the money or did it???
He could have had a milf that night
Simple explanation.  He saw his future and knew if he returned it he would eventually get 3thousand
Impressive❣️ Kudos to the parents of this kid👍😍
That’s craZy good karma is real !
That young man gives the future of this country a fighting chance. See what happens if you just try to raise your kids right?
Come on he drives an Audi he don’t need that money😂
VERY NOBLE 👏👏👏
How awesome is that! Lucky kid, the young mad is a trend setter, let not forget to thank the parents for raising a well mannered man. 💪😎👍🙌
May he be rewarded with many, many more blessings.
This young man is a true testimony to all things good and everyone should be like that.
Good kid doing the right thing.....
What a wonderful young man!  God bless him always. 🙏
Good on him what a gentlemen
Gran always said that patient, consistent teaching works 100% better in building good character in a kid than yelling, punishing and guilt tripping.  I bet this kid's  mom is proud of him.
Good raised foo
Nice to know other young men like myself still have heart too man
I like him.
It is still good people in the world
He saw her photo ID and was like im meeting this woman. 😂😂😂  he could of just returned it to customer service or police station.
He is so handsome and humble and his mother raised him right ! So happy for him! He deserves whatever comes his way !
this whole sketch has GTA5 vibes all over it. the entrance of the house is nearly a spitting image of Franklin's house, plus the irl game mechanic of getting a reward for returning something stolen. all it's missing is a yeeyee-ass haircut
Good job 👍👍👍
bros fit was cold 2
Wow, maybe the world hadn't lost all of it's humanity. Lol 😊
That’s awesome
Nice there is hope for Gen Z
What a guy . Fantastic stuff . C if he took the purse he could of got $50 cash a credit card and criminal record. He chose to give back and got rewarded over $3000 =karma
Goal was to reach $1,000 Currently at $5,170 Good job kid hope he gets all the money!
Special shout out to his mom for raising this young man the right way. I wish him the best future!🙏🏽💯
I know him!! We went to the same high school and remained homies he’s an awesome guy. His mom is a wonderful woman and I can completely understand why he would return it. He may look a certain way to people but he’s got a good heart and is a kind dude.
He has $5000k donated now 😑
Well deserved! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
He probably had a home. A car. And money to drive. You cannot compare the situations. I told the truth. I was always told to tell the truth.
That was honest and kind,the reward was a bonus but doing the right thing comes before a reward.  Glad she got her purse, when I lost mine 2 years ago and a theme park, I felt like I lost a kid for a few hours.
Good young man with morals
u dont need to steal to be a thug
Good man
Saw the neighborhood on the license realized a reward was worth more than the 100$ and debit cards😂😂😂
Fantastic
The responses in the comment section is like it is rarely done by people in US. In my country, it is just normal thing to do.
This reminds me of my little brother who used to steal purses and then give it back for fun 💀 15 years ago
Right on😎👍
It’s called money laundering.
Good dude man!
The world needs more people like this king
This would be better if it wasn't on inside edition.  Boy did right.
God damn, I never took one to someone's house, but there about 5 times a year I see a woman leave her purse on top the self checkout register and give it to em b4 they exit the store.....I want 3k
Good kid!!!
The good you put out into the world always has a way of coming back to you.
thats hilarious i did the same thing and they offered me $20 bucks but i was good.
Ok I commend the young man for doing the right thing as he should! Most ppl don't have friends/family who can throw 3,000$ reward for that. I think a thank you and maybe 20$ would've been enough!
A very rare breed of human being.
Good man!!!👍👍
❤️❤️❤️
The world needs more good people
Good job young man 👏
Kudos young man. You got to meet some pretty ladies too.
inside edition highlight the gofundme!
Good Job Man!!
Good for him ❤
I'd LOVE to return this woman's lost purse. 😏 😂
Way to go young man! Your mama raised your right!
he played it smart 💀
Good mum, good son. And: Good deeds do come around.
The three thousand got him more than if he took the purse that maybe had a few bucks in it. The things you do right can bring you happiness to you and others and with an even better reward even if thats not money.
Adrian is a G! big respect to him doing good when no ones looking
Whooa integrity 👏
Awesome!!!!!!
bro relax hes just returning a lost purse its not something to go crazy about
How sweet 🤍
goes to show that looks dont define everything, good on him.
Nice 💋
AWESOME ❣️
It's not that we need more people like him, it's that we need more parents like his.
who gaf
This is a great story, and I hope many more good things come to this wonderful teenager.
Blessings come 3-fold when you DO the right thing...well done young man!
👍👌
Stand up young man!!!! So proud of you!
So, doing good deeds pay
Great 👍 work.... People love to judge, but never give the option of non-prejudice
I did this before, didn't get anything. Barely a thanks.
“Teenager find women’s purse with ID, what happens next will shock you.”
Omg this made me cry my close friend in high school had the same name and was tragically killed when he got hit by a train. He had the same kind heart
I need this kind of news! Positive and uplifting!
Well,  I found a wallet along with the bank cards and credit cards in the parking lot, so I went to the nearby grocery store and gave it to the manager. I then came home and searched his name on Yellow pages and left a voice message. A few minutes later, he returned my call and I asked him if he lost his wallet. He said yes,  so I asked him to pick it up at that store. I have never forgotten a sincere tone in his voice. Getting ID replacement is such a chaos process though. While I was picking up all the belongings, a woman walked by and I asked her to be a witness when I go to the store.  Instead she asked me to give it to her and she will handle it.  I firmly responded her that it was my obligation to return to the owner myself and just go with me to the store. 2 days later,  I was out from the shopping mall and I dropped my rings in the parking lot.  I wasn't aware when the first one dropped, but the second right had a real stone and I felt a little noise. Then I immediately checked my finger and both rings were gone. I walked back a few steps and found those.  One was given by my mom and another has a Jake on it, both irreplaceable. I shared my friend and good deeds return too soon.
First thing he said was his mom raised him right.   Nothing about dad so a single mom can make a good decent young man. An even a corrupt California couldn't bring this teen down.  Much respect
Is this a scam?
Wow it’s rare for good news. 👏🏾
Good there’s hope for this world
Future Marine perhaps 👍🏼
He looks like HE stole it, saw nothing valuable inside, and decided to return it, perhaps expecting a $reward$
Yes that’s good things from both sides ! But I found an iphone once and called to return it to its owner but I was accused of robbing it upfront ! That kills the game !
Awesome ❤️
The fact that someone actually doing the right thing and returning a lost item is newsworthy is sad
So remarkable.👏👏👏👏👏
i got huge respect for this young man.
I love it. Good man
Well done, Mr. Rodriguez.  Well done.
Great job kid!!👍
Nice young man.
That very good is was grown well
gj man
Nice staging actors.. wake up people please
Good kid. Didn’t even ask for a reward. That’a who we need in leadership in the future of the country.
It’s a shame how we have to have kindness examples set for us like toddlers
I love stories like this, he seems like such a respectful and sweet kid. Good job mom too for instilling good values
Wow, I’m praying for that young man
He’s a good kid!
Good for him. ❤️❤️❤️ And I’m glad he was rewarded.
See that's what America supposed to be like you help one another love one another not what's going on today in this world he should have been rewarded for that he's an honest person
Good man. Yes, he’s a MAN, not a kid. Ive seen “men” act immature and could never be as mature as this guy. Good for him
Did a good deed and wasn't expecting a reward. Ended getting a pretty big reward. Kindness comes back around!!!!
That's what's up.💯👏
What I find hilarious is the implication that people have to be surprised by good deeds because we’re programmed to believe that someone that looks like this kid would probably take the money.
❤
Good for him!
Wow.. most people need to see this. NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER!
This kid dont know drug. Luckily.
homeboy bouta go buy salvage titled 99' ek hatch 😤😤
Real Americans
When u lose somthing and its returned to you feels likw million pound
YESSS FINALLY SOMEONE QITH THE LAST NAME AS MEEE
Nice. Good to see that he gave all the credit to his momma. Good guy in my book
He’s so sweet
Do the right thing even no one is watching. True.
I once left my wallet in a Walmart and someone at customer services held into it for two weeks. Eventually I was checking my Facebook messages and there was a request from the worker reaching out to me! Even after no response she kept it all that time. Bless people like that
He's making his mama proud. God bless you, Adrian. ✝️
His parents raises a fine young man
I still won’t return the purse that boy went back in hope sum pussy that’s it.
He's was raised right t0 do the right thing . He's a great young man . He's parents should be so proud of him. There honesty good people left in the cruel world .
Finally some good news!!😌😌
Ok I thought the ladies gave him 3k, but it was actually a community effort.  That kid drives an Audi
I’m js lookin at the comments for the “😍😍😍” LMFAO but yes ether way we should all be like this
Amazing!!!  God bless you boy!
Finnaly some good news..
Good boy! This mama is proud of you and I bet yours is so proud of you also. She did a great job :)
What a great young man. His mother raises him right. ❤❤
he left without wanting or getting a reward. shows hes character.
Probably saw her I’d photo and thought, damnnnn.
That's really cool 😎
Salute to the mother & to this kid
Imagine he just stole it and returned it expecting a reward
Wow,  great kid and great story. We need more people like Adrian   God is always looking at who's good and who's not.
What a sweetheart!!
Hmm
Shoutout to the kid he was raised right
This is the news that should be reported more often. Imagine the world we would leave in if more people were kind. Kindness breeds kindness. Negativity breeds negativity. Great report!
This makes my heart so happy
San diegans built different
So cool. Good parenting equals good children.
Best thing I’ve seen all day😊
If you do something nice for others it will come back in return to you so I am glad he did a good deed I hope he keeps it up in his life
Parents raised him well. Good Job! :)
God bless everyone
God bless him
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
I never understood why people say we need more people like this. I have found four IPhones plus a Samsung and returned them all. Found wallets with money in them and returned to the owner.  Good deeds like this happens all the time.  They aren't always televised.
Oh in Chula Vista
All that money is going to his car lol
Good Samaritan lottery could be a thing
He was lowkey tryna smash 😂
plot twist: it wasnt thier purse
The Aunt tho😍
Amazing. He is a beautiful souled man.
His mom raised him right 👍
This is what it looks like when Greta fails to catch teenage woman everytime she left the bag in the subway
Everyone take notes. We need more people like this in our society!
Thank God some positive news
Everybody, we all need to be kind like this young man in this video!
in 1981 when I was in the Air Force I had all my money in my wallet that I was going to use to visit by brother in Colorado. When I was running through the snow the wallet fell out of my pocket and I couldn't find it anywhere. When I thought I was broke and wasn't going to go on vacation I got a phone call from the air force police. Somebody had returned my wallet with all the money still in there. I took him name and was going to reward him but it was accidentally washed with my pants and I couldn't contact him. I always wished I could have thanked him and gave him a reward.
“wE nEeD mOrE peOpLe LikE tHis”  Everybody is acting like they don’t see the 100,000,000 other comments sayin the same thing, all for some likes lol.
This gives me hope. I would like to think my sons would have done the same. God bless this young man.
Bless this young man!!
This is our future. We have hope!
*WORST.BRAZZERS.SCENE.EVERRRR.!!*
He definitely has High Socks 🧦 👏🏼🤙🏻!
God  bless u More Young Man Such an Honest Lad! Very Rare Nowadays 🙏🙏👌
"Don't judge a book by its covers"
i can’t get over the fact that it looks like he tickled the doorbell.
👍🙂👍
Good lesson. It's a sad fact that everyone's watching these days
it's all fake the 3 r in it to make $$$$$ they spit it 3 ways , the kids a crackhead 2 ladies r cougars. q
He probably wanted to meet the pretty woman xD
He is fine & has manors 😭
Lil bro had better got a 3 sum
Such a handsome youngman and his mother is doing a great job.
Thank God he didn't go to a white woman's house
Good job still hope for this world
Omg what a wonderful young man!!! The world is proud of u!! Ur gonna do amazing things in life!!!
Wonder if he would have done this if she was not the same nationality.
It's things like this that give me a little hope that our society is not completely doomed.
What would Jesus do??? Amen baby boy
I once found a purse. (I'm young homeless man BTW I was starving) It had 20 bucks in it and I treated myself to some tacos and then returned the bag to the address it had a girls California i.d and a new iPhone (it had a password) so I just returned it. Then got slapped in the face she said hey I had 20 bucks.
Plot twist: he saw how much was in her purse and wanted to spot her home for a heist set up when he got the chance.
GOOD PARENTING PAYS OFF💪🏽
Good people come in all shapes and colors
Sick ass foo!
It’s awesome because if you would take a glance at him, you might profile him to be someone that would actually steal a purse lol. Young man is raised right !
Massive respect for this young man. I wish more people had this much integrity.
I found a wallet with around 1200 dollars in it and returned it😊
Flipping awesome.  Well done people.
TEACH THE BLACK YOUTH THIS !
Can't believe idiots would steal
Sagging pants, wearing chains, looking like people were taught to be afraid of yet kinder than 99% of the people who would be afraid of him.
As I mentioned in the other video, this has to be a Stripper purse,  he new exactly what he was doing.
She got lucky anyone else would of kept it 💯   Shows there is good ppl out there
He’s a good kid may god continue to bless and protect him
What’s the twist
This is the right thing to do if possible, avoid taking anything to lost and found or employees because items like that often get "lost" again.
My heaaaart ❤❤❤
I returned a lost purse but somehow I got accused of stealing it from the cart
The good you put into the world always has a way of coming back to you.
What a great dude! Rrspect to you bro!
Good job
Well done young man Don't fulfill those stereotypes
Notice how his race was never mentioned in the comments, but if this was a crime that would be the 1st comment that you'll read.
W mans
Lucky a black guy didnt find the purse cause it would of been a lost cause 😂😂
This is nice and all but I wish returning a lost purse would be the norm and not unexpected
California needs more of this and not looking up to ya'lls gang/rap culture
nice story, but 98 percent of people wont give 3000 dlls plus to someone for returing property, this is just to manipulate viewers
That is so good of him to do and by the way very good that he got a reward. That means he will grow up knowing to do the right thing because he will be rewarded for it
There is GOOD out there, heart warming video,  thank you.
That’s how my parents raised me as well. I’m 24 but would’ve done the same thing.
Yay!
Good for him… proud of him
All it takes is a good parent... thank GOD for his mother
I walked from Greeley Colorado to Brownsville Texas with 57$ on me... first small town in Texas on HWY 385,  I found a wallet by the high way,  I picked it up put it in my backpack... when I got home I went to the post office and bought a big envelope and send the wallet to the owner,  including $11,000 , what I didn't tell you was I lost my last $40i saved to eat... I got home really hungry,  my mother hugged and began to cry,  I have never walked 1320 miles alone... in Christmas I received a letter from Florida with a bank check for $6,000... and a huge thank you note...I walked for 14 days to get home,  but had not eaten in 5 days... it never crossed my mind to take money to eat... I was raised to work if you want something... I was so relieved to be home with my mother...
They sound surprised that there is honest people in this world :-D
What you put out you get back!!
honestly if you find a purse or wallet and it has a license how can u see it and not return it
We all know he dig in it an didn’t saw anything valuable
last time i lost my wallet, someone bought games online with my credit card. good on this kid
They raise over $30,000 for him. So proud of him doing this. Heard about this on the news this morning.
Being nice and good to others is so rare that people get shocked by it.
I found some ladies purse with ID too drove to her house just for the persons house turned the merch to her mom and got yelled at for "stealing" the money that was inside😭😭
Good kid respect
uh  great job teen.
Oh my gosh I love this!!!!!
Good boy, and good Mama!
Needs to be more people like this guy in this world !
That's the homie right there <3
Why is this news? A small act of kindness shouldn’t have to be recognized by the news.
"there's hope in the younger generation" It's about time
Good job my guy! This makes me have some hope in my generation
He made more money doing the right thing rather than stealing what's there.  Hopefully this will motivate other potential thieves
We’ll deserved what a good person !!!
It’s sad that when one person does an honest thing it makes the news?? like is it that rare that it makes the news?  it’s sad that that’s the world we live in
They should have rewarded him with a belt 💀  But Bless him ✊🏽
Amazing ❤️
Ok so there is a slight bit of hope! Don't know this kid but I'm so proud of him!...
Bro got more then he would’ve if he stole it see always be honest n you’ll get what u deserve
Help him find his future for this noble act.
I would’ve done the same thing !
I've done this many times as a teen. Never got anything from man but God blessed me. There was no cams nor social media then
A lot of younger generation is good as long as they were raised by republicans real trap
Never judge a book by the cover
There you go, good parenting. Kudos to the parents
Finally saw some good deed video from America😅
Thht is amazing..i.found one in cart to but just gave to coutesy booth
A Latino guy just like me, most of us still have family values! Good job brother 👏👍🙌
dhar mann ripoff
There's hope for our young generation, yes but not all of them!  Good for him tho.
very nice !
God bless his young pure heart
Glad he returned it…green isn’t his color 😝
Awesome
❤️
SUCH a sweet heart
Great job bud your parents did raise you right.Godbless!
What a great kid. Hope he's going to a good college.
A few years ago my wallet had fallen out of my pocket in downtown Dallas in a heavily trafficked parking lot. I get a LinkedIn message from a random person saying he found my wallet. He worked 2 blocks from me. Offered to buy him dinner but he declined Never will forget that nice deed.
His mom should be so proud. What a great kid!
Bless this Man and his family 🥰 His mom/father raised him right .. Alot of respect for him 👏
Am I the only one that notices he looked at her drivers license and thought she was cute and was hoping to get laid?? 😉
Most ppl would of gave 20$ or nothing 3k is like hitting the lottery for a good deed
Good dude
the thumbnail looked like something out of GTA SA 💀
he deserves it but i find it crazy this is news these days
Thats a person with great character with endless potential, need more stories like this!
It is stories like this that give me hope. There is always time for bad news on the internet, so it is fantastic to hear something like this. Bravo young man❤
People shouldn't expect awards every time they do something good.
“There’s hope for the young generation” no, no there isn’t.
Faith restored
Good dude!!
Salute to the young brotha
now this is a certified hood classic
Awesome, great young man
3k?!?!?!?!?!! where can i sign up?????
Good job to the parents and boy. Well raised.   My siblings and I have also returned a few wallets and purses. I got some good karma when I lost my purse on vacation with 1000s of dollars in it. Someone found it and returned it :)
The thing is, this should not even be a thing. It should be absolutely normal to return things If they don't belong to US.  The young man was raised right though
Well done young man👏🏽parents should be proud🤝✊🏽
chula vista stand up!!
Way to go young man! Your parents  must be proud.
Hi
❤️❤️❤️❤️
what a back handed compliment LMFAO
Prime example of toxic masculinity right here 👏 👌 🙌
AMEN, & God Will Bless Him & Son you continue to do GOOD DEEDS IN THIS LIFE. 💯💯❤❤
Good for him
Great job all around..from his parents to all the contributors.
Amazing
THIS IS FOR ALL TRUMPS WHITE RICH AMERICA. STOP JUDGEING PEOPLE FOR WHAT THEY WARE, NOT EVERYONE THA WEARS A BASEBALL HAT AND CHAINS THA LIKES HIP HOP MUSIC OR THUGS AND CRIMINALS AND ILEGALS. GOOD DEEDS COME AND ALL COLORS. NOT JUST WHITE.
And this is how you reward "Good Samaritans " Because the police department or any governmental facility is gonna just give you a pat on the back. And most of the times the act is done by a lower class citizen who could use some financial help. Despite their integrity and finding out if these citizens can use some help or not, they get a shout out in the local news or newspapers. The good Ole American way!v
Good man! And good ladies!
Good bloke.
Elaina was so fine he had to see for himself 😭😭😭😭
What a good honest young man I am so proud of him you were very blessed to get back your wallet ❤️
The advice this boys mom gives  is exactly what my mom says to me. W kid
I’m rich so I would’ve gave THEM money
This couldnt go wrong, Well done Martinez 👍
What a good young honest man.
Definitely  Raised right  !
Homeboy wanted to meet the hot chick on the driver’s license.
Attaboy good job the world needs a ton more just like you
he’s cute lmaooo what’s his @
Also , thank goodness he didn't got shot for carrying that purse 🙏
The one quote that always stayed in my mind " the best deed goes unseen". Don't need a thank you or a reward. You did it because it was the right thing to do so, thank you sir
There good  out there, mostly  humble
Sweet kid. You wouldn't expect a gabacho pocho from southern California to do a good deed like that 🤣
Both parties were great  The kid for returning it, and the owner and her friend for realizing that they should reward him for his good deed I mean props to everyone in the story, can't really say that very often
GOD BLESS THIS YOUNG MAN LESSON TO B LEARNED 👌😇🙏🏼🦮🦮✌🏻🇺🇸
I think this was staged
This young man was raised right. Good integrity!
And by just looking at him most people would say he would be the one that would snatch the purse. Thrilled at his character. I congratulate the parents but this kid has his own conscience as well
We ain’t gunna talk about this drip though. The fits fire
I returned one wallet with cards and cash one time but I received nothing so you have to be lucky if they wanna reward you..
So sweet.
We don't need more people to tell more people how we need more people to be like this kid in the world.
6.29.22 no ww3 nk
I believe Karma and thank you to lovely honest boy ❤
This kid was raised wrong like it was easy money
Great kid, God bless him! 💜
nice young men like him need to stop dressing like drug dealers lmfao
Someone chased me down at Walmart and handed me my wallet with 3400 inside I left by the register back in 2015. I almost had a heart attacks I tried to give the lady $200, she wouldn’t take it. So I kissed her on the forehead lol
Yes, amazing that he returned the purse. However it’s the bare minimum? And I find that as a woman this sort of treatment is far gone for us..something to think about.
Integrity. Good for that young man.
This is an amazing young man..good on his momma!
Don’t get it twisted there is no hope for the younger generations. He’s one in a trillion.
Love it. It’s not difficult to do the right thing when you were raised right.
gives me hope for this world
Must really make Democrats mad when they see kids doing the right thing instead of joining their party and becoming terrorists.
Yea I did this one time with a wallet at a Anaheim Walmart and found the address on the ID. The Asian people there didn’t even wanna answer the door instead opening their blinds to communicate with me 😂. I showed them the ID that was inside the wallet and it was their daughters but they continued to treat me like an animal and told me to leave the wallet in the curb. Some nerve on those people 😂. True story
This is so awesome.
Props to the young brother!!! Never change homie! 🙏🏾🙏🏾
Staged
he got a sweet ride
LORD JESUS, PLEASE BLESS THIS YOUNG MAN...PLEASE KEEP YOUR LOVING ARMS WRAPPED AROUND HIM AMEN 🙏🏾
Now did he steal anything
What goes around, comes around... Good boy young man!
Makes me smile
Very cute the way he held the purse . Good job young man 👏
how tf you forget your purse in the cart..
Look at him then the chick he's trying to get puddin points
Wat a great young man x
Well done to the young man, with this attitude he will do great in life
Well done kid
It's moments like these that keep what little faith I have in humanity alive
if i saw the photo of that fine mom ill drop off the purse ASAP
All love to the crip fa that
She could’ve kept the money, She could’ve paid in a multitude of other ways😇
Beautiful 🥰
Thats when young people steal purses and claim they found just to get a 3K award now, after this.
La chancla raised him right!
If cops saw him they would have SHOT Him on SIGHT. No questions asked!!
Now this is the type of news we need!!😊💕
W Young fella
the mothers accent is amazing 🤩 🤩🤩
Way to go dude! Mr. Rodriguez, you deserve every cent. Glad to hear that there is still good out there.
He wanted to meet the lady lol
💜💜💜
Awesome! 👏 I have done this so many times! One time I found a wallet with a guys whole paycheck, like $4000 & drove to his house and he gave me a $40 tip!  🙏🏻♥️🤗
Great job young man!!
This is amazing!
Love this!
Me right after this video: Purseman defender of purses
God bless him for being a hero.
What a nice story ❤️
What a fine young man!  His Mom & Dad should be very proud of him.   He was raised right!  He's listening to his Mama! 🥰
As of this comment the fundraiser is over five thousand dollars so far.
Good job to my Latino brother but needs to learn to pick his pants up and keep them on his waist.
Prob saw that ID pic and was trying to smash lol
What a stupid woman for not asking him his name or at least offer something to him.
I wish everyone raised their kid this way. I have the same mentality as him.
I can see his mom   raised the right way. She is a very good mother and she is blessed to have a son who follows her teachings,  because not many kids these days listen to their parents. God bless him and his mom   🙏❤.  May God bless all the people who rewarded this young handsome honest boy.
Great job Adrian Rodriguez!
Super cool Mr.Rodriguez!!! 👊🏾
Good parenting! watch people and learn b4 u go around having kids! 💀
All you heartless teenagers take note. What a wonderful world this would be if everyone was raised like this gentleman Hope you get back 100 fold. You have no idea how many people's hope in humanity you've restored by this act of kindness! Stay blessed young man!
Finally some awesome news!  His mama did right by him! A real man will hold a woman’s purse with pride!
He's the real G
Smart young man but doing the right thing that was nice of him to do that he  was raised right young gentleman😌
So this kid steals a purse so that he could return it on purpose and get awarded for it? Genius
Don't judge a book by its cover. 💯
What a good young man!!!! ❤️
Hell yeah this is the America I want to live in! 👍
great job son
“There’s hope for our younger generation“ 😔
What a cutie 🥰
Wow power of social media. I only have whatsapp
yeah it would be very very nice and most people would do this but unfortunately we live in a society that you have bad people out here and you have good people out here just wish the more people will come to do the right thing thank you sir and God bless you sir and hopefully many blessings come towards you and your family
This is one of the most positive best energy videos I have seen lately OMG so much positivity
It’s so wonderful to see a young man do the right thing🤗.   What a breath of fresh air he is😊. Parents raised him right!!
I love how people act like this is the only good young kid in the world.  Stop.
he has a new Audi he doesn’t need to steal anything or keep it for the money in the first place so it’s not the same as someone who actually needs money 🤷🏾‍♂️
He must be Canadian 😁🇨🇦
Awesome
kudos to his momma she raised him right 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Good kid and awesome reward.  Well deserved.
So awesome to see this especially when the world is literally going to hell in a hand basket!!! Good for him!!
I honestly think he was trying to shoot his shot. Lol She’s pretty.. I mean he looks pretty dressed up to return a purse. I see you 😉
That was wonderful that he was honest and rewarded for being honest..the golden rule
I always do that not expext thing in return and not a big deal lol
Well raised
wow... i would have totally not return that purse i done it plenty of time and sleep very well at night.
His mama did a great job 🥰
NHhh 3k is nothing
Wonderful story and I want people to see not to judge a book by it’s color. People could have looked at his low pants and chains and made the wrong assumption!
lol bruh??? I didnt think shyt like that happened still especially from a 17 yo kid that's respect and he was definitely raised the right way
So many parents try to raise their kids right but this young man took those morals & applied them himself. 👏🏼
We need more kids like this in the world. 🙏
I found the same thing in a cart at my job turned it in
This is the kind of news that make me feel alive!! What a wonderful kid!! His mother definitely thought him well!! I hope to have a kid like that one day!! God bless him and anyone who is reading this! 💕🙏
Aw he is a nice young man. Keep it up.
Imagine this was staged and the three of them split the go fund me money lmao
This is the type of news we need to see more of🥹❤️
THIS IS HOW GOOD PEOPLE 👍 ACT IN THE SOCIETY
Just remember what comes around goes around
God bless him!
Need more young men like him.  Great job Adrian.
I love to see anything positive these days, it is such a rarity . I hope some more of our youth take note of a man  in the making.
God bless him !!!! It starts with his Mom and Dad bringing him up !!!!
This is a true gentleman! Wow! What a sweetheart! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
When I did a similar deed I was treated like a criminal by police because I chose to return the woman's purse directly to her instead of simply handing it over to the store or to the police.
Proud of this young man 💅🥰🥰ngl  if that was a black person they would have stole it
Bless him!
I love this, he is a good person and his honesty has caused him to receive more than what was in the bag, GOD bless him.
Hey smash and grabbers take notes from your prison cell
It's called integrity. And a Christian world view of loving others how you wanna be loved. It's sad that this is what makes the news, Christians being Christian . But may God bless this young man and praise his Mom. Love it.
Kudos!
She secretly wanted to find him so she could smash
I hope my son grows up to be honest and caring like this young man. I would be so proud!!
Stand up guy did what was right ladies look for guys like this
🙌
Beyond proud of this young man's honesty. Gives me hope for the future!! And, what a reward. Blessings to him!!!🙏🙏❣❣🤗
Always remember when you think no one is watching, someone is, that's the Almighty god.
old people in comments will y'all return 3millon cash in if u found it? Let's see the people?
Woôw
Amazing
He kindaaa 😍
Now this is a feel good story the world needed! That’s wonderful. Gob bless this young man because someone else probably would’ve taken the purse.
The ten Commandments: Will you go to heaven after you die? "For whoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all" (James 2:10). You have to face the Holy God on judgment day. He sees lust as adultery (Matt 5:28) and hatred as murder ( 1 John 3:15). Will you be guilty? Jesus took your punishment on the cross, and rose again, defeating death, to save you from Hell. Repent (Luke 13:5) and trust in him today. " For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life"((John 3:16)
smart for checking id
This gentleman was truly raised right, I have hope for the next generation👍🏾👍🏾
Kudos to that young man and his parents.. good things will come to them
I know the country need this kind of story from all the mass shooting and violence robbery, but it look staged. Everything is there to capture the moment.  Maybe it's just me believing the mainstream one sided propaganda, particularly on the Ukraine War etc.  👀💐
Nice
When you return it to a rich person. Also the teen couldn't get much for it anyway
plot twist. he stole it in the first place..
Your a good man .. god bless
So many brother and sister out there is nice just pray
This is a lovely news for the Hispanic community. We were taught morals and values from the Catholic Church.
I wish everyone in the world was like this. There'd be less crimes and more prosperity ‼️
Wow. We do not see good people like this doing this in today's world. I take this as a mere miracle in disguise!
Wish he would have been the one to find my wallet recently instead of whoever stole all the cash out of it 🥲
Money
well done young man.. little hope for this generation that i thought was long gone
He's a real one.
There’s a good man right there
Oh so when I return a lost purse it's just a funny and happy memory, but when he decided to do it he's a hero??? Where's my 3K??🤣🤣 *All jokes*
Goodness brings blessings
He saw her photo on her driver's license and thought she was hot, hoping for a hookup with her.
I hope someone privately reached out to this guy and gave him an extra talk with..  $$$. What a good dude. I hope he gives back to the ones who raised him in such a way as well, but still buys a sweet watch or something with a little of the money. Maybe a vehicle upgrade.
I pray he knows Jesus Christ.   I pray you know and trust the only begotten Son of God.   Amen.
Good guy! Good mom! 🙏❤️
Action speaks louder than words
The $47 in cash will be spent in a day Knowing you did the right thing is more powerful and lasting even if no one else knows
This makes me happy!
Daddy Material
1000 th comment
She's fine asf . I would definitely have done the same
this shii makes me wanna get up and go do something nice frfr
And he’s fine *chefs kiss*
Good for him!
That cheap women wants other people to give him reward money.
That’s true cristian values something that is missing in todays youth. You take children to church and bring them through faith to make good deeds you get a good honest child. These bang bang shoot ‘em up kids never probably stepped on church with there parents
👍👍👍👍👍👍
I love this kid
I would've taken some head
Should’ve just gave him some 🐱 and a BJ, Probably did that too actually. Good for him 💪🏾
Kudos to his Mom she raised a True Winner.. Just awesome..
he probably stole it and pretended he found it
Good Karma!!!
He just wanted to smash an instant regrets
Well done Adrian
His parents raised him right..
We need to shine the spotlight on things like this more often, at least as often as we focus on the negative. Put negative out, get negative back in.
Yes and never judge a person by its cover too at least you thought of rewarding him back someone else would of ran off with it and grabed what they wanted and then ditched it somewhere
I'm so proud of this young man who chose to do the right thing!
There's a special place in heaven for that dude!
Eliana what’s up with your face
He definitely hit SIMPLE
God knows the good in bad inside a person this was his good deed for him and god knows the doors for good jobs and good things in life for him 99% of 1% u see real youngster like this with responsibility  hard working moms bless the mom of the young guy
1000 comment 😁😁🙏🙏🙏😣😹😹😹☹️☹️
He was raised right 🦸🏻‍♂️
YOU'RE AN AWESOME YOUNG MAN AND YOU WILL GO PLACES!!!
nice
Amazing young man  Last week three people who had never met before stopped to help out a young couple change a flat tire.  I told the young lady that no matter how bad things look now  There will always be good people willing to do the right thing
His momma raised him right! She must be so damn proud of him as she should be
The guy is lucky a racist police didn't spot him.
Idk... it is very good what he did, but shouldn't this just be a normal thing to do. I found ID's and wallets of like 7 people already, gave them back, received some chocolate and 20 dollars and thats it. Made my day but i just really think this should be a normal thing to do for everyone and this is hyped up like its soooo rare.
He was prolly like if my mom lost her purse I know she would be crazy looking for it. 🙋‍♀️👛
W kid
I love finding peoples belongings. It becomes a video game quest and I WILL SUCCEED!
he thought he was finna be on the UDY show
insane good karma
As the saying goes, dont "judge the book by its cover" I'm not gonna lie, didn't think they would answer the door by how he was dressed, I also, am a LPN in a Seniors Apt. Complex in a fancy Village, I was raised there, but moved to the city young, due to my harassment in regards to being unique (& abused) I still have funky half shaved/colored hair, 21 piercings( just in my nose and ears) I can wear what I want (no scrubs) & up until Covid, many of tenants would rather wither away then ask help from me since my job was to help keep them their.  FINALLY, when they saw ppl having to go to rehab outside of our facility for up to 3/6 months, & never came back, due to Covid (13 the first couple months) they weren't so afraid to as for my help, since my job is to help them stay healthy in their Apts. Instead of them loosing it to have to go live in a nursing home, did they finally realize, I'm just unique! I'm also happy they didn't bring that up in the video 😉
His mom raised a great young man!
Good boy. He will make a fine police officer.
How terrible that everyone lives in a place where this must be praised and rewarded instead of expected. Another reason I love living in a rural area where everyone takes care of each other.
good on ya , mate   🙅‍♂️
Good man!
Don’t judge a book by it’s cover
W kid respect the council shall put your name in the hall of fame
Sheeesh she said there is hope for this generation  Ma'am wait for the cops to finish all of them as they always do to good ppl ✌️
Hope he wasent black...
Plot twist:  they never gave him the GoFundMe money
LMAO BRUH KUS WANTE TO HOLA AT SHORTYY LMAO
Everyone says, "We need more people like this." Bruh, just be like him.
i work at a golf course so much things i returned phones and wallets way more ahaha it feels good being a nice person
Great kid parents did an amazing job !
It speaks a lot about him and they should leave the parents out of it. That’s not automatically indicative of good parenting his dad could’ve did him wrong. Just give him credit for being a good person.
His mother must be so proud 🙏🏽🙏🏽❤️❤️❤️❤️👍👍
hes never heard of finders keepers?
Exactly what I would do (returned a guy's fat wallet back to the CLUB). Someone pointed out a wallet on the floor intoxicated, so I thought it was mine until the next morning :)
kid acting goofy and look like a ghetto but have a big heart! kids got future.
We really do need more people like that.
Great job, Adrienne.  Keep it up, you'll go far!
He's fine lol
This is the news I want to see
Oh my what a amazing young man , God will bless him as well. I say thank you myself to this young man, your a beautiful sole .
Kids made sure there was a video door bell 😋
he is fineeeee
I'd love to shake that kids hand. He has a bright future with a lovely family. He'll make a great father.
hey got more then 3k if u know what I mean
That's awesome 😎
Great news! Thanks inside-edition for a real amazing story! God bless that kid! He deserves all that $$..very rare these days in our country real true people do that!!! This kid has more heart and soul and honestly is beyond RARE!🤷🙆😎😎😎👏👏👏👏
This was his plan all along
Well done young  man!  Please Inside Edition keep posting good deeds news.  We need them because we only see bad news and there more good than bad in this world.
😊
Bless his mom for instiling good behavior to her children....
Good job
So weird that doing the exact right thing throws people off so much.
❤️
I think most would look at him and judge him for his appearance which is a shame, he’s going to go places in life for sure! Good for this dude! What a generous human he is and all those who donated to him.
That’s what a real gangsta do, become selfless when everybody isn’t.
Honoring his mother.  Priceless.
That brunette on the right is bad as hell
Seems like a homie I would need on my team ngl
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Plot twist: he was the reason it was missing in the first place.    "How things begin aren't important as how they end" -aria
Plot twist: There was nothing valuable in the purse so he decided to return it anyways
Now people gonna start doing nice things just wanting a reward
HEY INSIDE NEWS  YOU SHOULD DO A LIL HISTORY SEARCH   THEY KNOW EACHOTHER AND DID IT FOR TIKTOK VIDEO AND YALL REALLY FALLIN FOR IT LOL
GOOD BOY!!!!!😁👍✌️🙏
Did I just hear “there’s hope for our younger generation “?  Tf is that supposed to mean?
I returned a lot of things to people and never got a reward :(
you can be raised right and still do the wrong thing so props to him
Tbh, I wouldn't open the door these days due to all the crimes related to intruders, but I guess I'm judging the book by its cover in this case
😍
He is fine indeed 😻
What a great kid!! To teach your kids to do the right thing is important!
Just remember God is always watching, nice job young man 🤗❤️‍🩹🕊
once my family and I wanted to visit a castle in Sardinia and ended up in a horror movie-like isolated place with just one house.  No one was at home and we couldn't really imagine someone living there but there was clothing hanging to dry. Well, we got the chills, went back to the car, and drove off.  Some hours later my father said in the middle of the street,, I LOST MY WALLET'' and so we spent an hour searching for his stupid wallet but couldn't find it.  Very frustrated and nervous we went to the police station and surprise! the wallet was already there.  The owner of the horror house found the wallet in front of his house and drove an hour to the city to give it to the police. Sadly we couldn't get their name or we would have sent them a present. Well, what I wanted to say is... horror house owner...if you read this .... grazie <3
“Hope”     L M A O !
My boi just hit the biggest lick 😈 🧠
WOW How many people in America still raise their kids the right way.. Good young man
Well God bless him
edgar 2 the rescue 🙏🏽🙏🏽
Honestly we do dirty things in this gen… but like for a random person we will do the most wonderful things I love us sm!!
We need to be like this kid
When stories like these make headlines, you know that our society is doomed, lmao
The Mexican American community looks out for eachother
He was like mhmm she kinda fine🥳
What a great kid!! Love this!!
Love it. Yes there's hope for the future of kids
Good person
How is this news?
Most people return post found purses and wallets; no?   I think they do.  I personally have found 3 or 4 wallets over the years and returned them.   My wife has left her purse a couple places and never had a problem either.   Not saying the kids doesn't deserve praise.  But I think this should be how we expect each other to act in society instead of surprised.
He deserves so much good karma :)
I’ve done this, it’s really not that inconvenient
Looks like kruk one
My husband pulled a woman’s purse out of lake when he was fishing. And although most was demanded she had her seeing glasses that were still hood and me and him both depend on those ourself. So he drove 40 minutes to deliver to her house. She was very grateful. She said it had gone missing when she was camping there a few weeks back.
It’s sad you pay taxes on your money, then you give it away. Then they have to pay taxes.
She’s right. There is hope! Thank god I was . That close to losing it.  His parents did good!
God bless him x
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
God bless him🤩
My name is Aydrian tooo im 17 yayy
Good job young man! You're a credit to your people son.
Little brother---you got a good heart and your Momma taught you right.  Every time I think youngsters can't get much grimier, something like this happens and restores my faith in the youth!
Good deeds will always be paid back. He’s a good kid!
Damn fool, dont you know the kid stole it
If only more kids of this generation were like him.
Well js. The kid was driving a nice audi. Soooo. He didn't need the money in the purse.
great  story,  God  bless that  young  man
He's a breath of fresh air.
He fine asl 🤭🤭
💀
Lmao he stole it for a reward
Awesome young man. Thank you for your goodness 🦋
People like him would've made this world a lot better.
Lovely young man!
Nice to see an uplifting story for a change.
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿💯💯💯
We need more stories like this right now! Great kid! Nice work young man!
i already feel on the ground just by his kindness 🧎🏻‍♀️✋😫🤚
I promise you it was mostly cause she's attractive.
Similar story happened to my mom. We were at a mall and she left her purse on the top of the car by mistake and we went to see a movie. She had her main card in her pocket so she didn't realize her purse wasn't in her bag well 4hrs later she realized it was missing and when we returned to the car a note was left on the car saying I have your purse and he left his number. The man had to go back to work so he took it with him down the road where he worked as a car sales manager. The purse was returned safely back to my mom. The man said he noticed the purse and got into his car but than he saw people eyeing it and walking up and down pass is suspiciously so he took it incase it was stolen. God bless him.
"Someone found my purse, give them your money"
I found a wallet with no money, just drivers license,  some credit cards and stuff. I knocked on the door, dude answered and accused me of stealing the money in the wallet. Cops came and arrested me, charges were dropped a month later. Cost me $1500 bond.
damn and hes hella fine
Take some notes kiddos doing the right thing might not only give you a rewards but it will feel better too 🥰 kindness is free!
Shame they’re ain’t many youngsters like him anymore
What he did is great and all but opening the door for a stranger at your front door ??? in these times. She is very lucky.
Result of good parents and good environment too. I guess.
Amazing kid!  Well deserved $3k
Absolutely Amazing boy.
Good job homie
God is watching.
good to hear a nice story for once!
Man I feel for adrian. He probably was like I will do the right thing cause it's the right thing & that's what momma said....   Rubs his chin...but she cute tho. No disrespect she is pretty and so is her aunt and he did the right thing regardless. Stay up Adrian You'll catch your humminbird and your honorable that's what matters.
I have returned three wallets and a purse full of cash to the right full owner even chasing down a place to place based on the information from her purse, a mother with children purse full of documents for citizenship before my flight home from San Jose. Not a very good outcome for some of the people that I helped, one asked " Wow, money is still here, ...?. But, I felt good that I have made an example to the children that I met.
MVP
what a honorable young man!! thank you to his Momma for teaching him to do the right thing! ❤
What an outstanding young man
Women be like
His parent must be proud of him. Good boy
It’s sad that this is making the news. Just goes to show how evil the world really is. God bless the kid tho
very very rare
My mom did this a while back. Wasn’t expecting anything back and ended up with $100 as a thank you from the couple.
His parent did a great job they should be proud.
aweee
God bless
You go cutie. Not only do you got looks, you got good heart and that’s what matters most. Your mom did awesome with you. You’ll make it along way in life and will be blessed for your wonderful actions!
Hope for the future generations
Get this kid out of the hood before it's too late.
Out here doing the Lords work!! 🙏
Just proves doing good can reward u in life mostly your humanity
God bless him 🤣
cops would have stolen the bag
I wish this young man nothing but the best in life. Honesty, respect and decency in this vile world is worth more than all the temporary riches. Bless his parents too.
That’s what I like to see!!
What if there was nothing valuable in the purse so he just returned it
He is quite a superstar!
The only reason he was rewarded 3k was because the lady had nudes in her purse but little did she know the guy already took photos of her nudes
Mad respect to this kid, but this family is the real MVP of this story. To reward him for his kind deed in that way is beautiful! This lesson will stay with him for life.
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Can someone go leave there wallet purse somewhere so I could find it. Start a go fund me. for me, and we’ll split it 🤑
Lmao probably trying to get with her but still ❤️❤️
Fake! People believe anything 😂 🤣
Love this!! What an amazing young man!! 😁💕
back in the day, returning stuff was common, now it need a news report.....
California love.
Good deed on that guy very rare type of person , most people would keep it for theirself
It’s just not the younger generation only, it all generation’s that should be more like him!! 💚💚
I did the same thing when I was younger, before gofund me existed. 🤦‍♂️ Still got about $25 as a reward though. 😎
Salute to you young king 🤴🏾
Not every young man in this world with a backwards hat is a "gangsta"
In my country, recently a guy found old couple savings for an apartment for their kids. The amount was around 70-80 thousand euro, which is a lot for our standards! Later that day he was able to return the money to them! The only thing they wished for was for the money to not be found by a human, which was very sad and reasonable to hear, since there aren't any people like this 17 year old guy and my recent country hero! I hope they have a wonderful future!
I found a man's wallet in a parking lot when I was 14 and it had $1500 cash in it.  Our across the street neighbor was a fire chief, so he knew the town very well and was able to point us to where the man's license said he lived (this was 1985, so no interwebs).  I rang the doorbell and gave the man the wallet and he said "thanks" and slammed the door.  It was almost like he was TRYING to lose it.  I was taught to try to look past behavior like this because perhaps he had just lost someone, or found out he was sick, or whatever.   LOL.  Anyway, as the young man stated, do the right thing ESPECIALLY when noone is looking.
Everyone liked that
Good to know some of these kids still listen to their parents. Good job to his mother
Looks more like a gang member
We need more youngsters like this...  Not more gangsters...
Well done Adrian!🙌🙌🙌
Mama is always right!
Integrity
Amazing
The fact he is dress like a thug and isn't a thug should show people that dressing like that is a lifestyle and doesn't mean there gang banging or up to no good
big w for that teenager
keeeewl
Good parents he has…. Good for him..
I thought owner gave him 3k -,-
Now this is how you raise children.
BEAUTIFUL!!!
This foo bought a mamlona with the money
Good!! Rewarding the deserving!!
virtual handshake to him and his parents
watched 6 29 22
It’s called integrity. Good job, young man!
this makes me cry!!!
*With the world set on tearing itself apart, don't seem like such a bad thing to me to put a little bit of it back together*  is what this Young man's Motto in life. RESPECT.
And that's how it's supposed to be.
Old lady looks like 27 😍
God bless this guy and multiply his blessings!!
good job Rodriguez!
Dang that was pretty awesome of this kiddo and the ladies
Oh wow amazing what a good kid raised right
This is what happens one you do good
He’s such a sweetheart🙂
Awesome young man 🙏🏽💯👏🏽🙌
For every right thing done, there's a million wrong things done at the same time 🤣
and he would be labeled a "thug" by right wing media just cause how he was dressed.
what a stand up guy
Honest young man probably raised the right way, shout out to his parents
While once working at a gas station, I found a crisp 100.00$ bill. Instead of keeping it, I turned it in. The owner came for it the next day. During the next several weeks random customers would give me tips exceeding 100.00$.  Doing good really pays off.
Sick ass foo hell a firme 🤣🤣
I did this when I worked at a grocery store... got a 20 dollar tip when she had 1000s or so she said.. sometimes I question what's better to do
His momma raised a good young man.  I'm so glad he was rewarded for his good deed.  Keep paying it forward!
Such a positive outcome! I will agree with many here and say that we need this kind of message so much these days. Kudos to this young man's mom for instilling such great values, and for him really following those values. Great job all around!!
Back in late 80 ,me and my buddy's found a purse with 10 grand in it ,setting in a booth at burger king .we  called the cops, while we was waiting on them ,the lady came back .she  told us she got the money out for a car .she never offered us a dime ,lol. But that wasn't the point ,we never expected anything .we was just glad she got it back .
Love this. I hope we can get somewhere in society where this is done on a regular basis (without reward).
🙏❤️🙏
How much was in the purse
California is so extra. Marteen?? You mean ugh Martin?? Wtf
Well at least he did the right thing
Way to go Bro . . . set the example for all your homies!!!!!!!  Karma will always come back and reward you eventually!
YNWA BAYBAY
Inside edition: posts video  17 yr old kid: *becomes billionaire*
Raise a child  with love and kindless but don't spoiled him/her, so one day he/she become good adult.
Good for his mom and he remembered the lesson do the right thing even when no one is listening
I’m never going to stereotype anyone again lol
I know he’s a true homie must be nice to be around
Such a great gentleman I hope I raise my son like this
Who says today's teens have no morals?
Never assume you'll get money as a reward. Just do the right thing no matter what!
So nice!
Ain no hope fa the generations cause people like me
Why be honest when u can be a career criminal like tRump, who made a FAKE Uni and became president? CONservatives will ALWAYS reward crime, dishonesty and atrocities
Maybe don't drink so much wine you lose your purse lol
Totally just saw the drivers license photo and thought to himself “milf, maybe I can get some if I return it”
That’s right a Mexican too!! He’s making us look good young and everything awesome!!!
He is setting up a good example for everyone to follow
Good kid.
If I could I would shake his hand. This man just gave me a tiny sliver of hope. Great Job!
A boy raised right
That's awesome of you young man! 👏
Wow he is lucky too
I remembered finding someone's wallet, I was ready to drive 40 minutes to his house after typing his address, but found his email and discovered he was close by. He took $50 from his wallet and gave it to me, told him no and he insisted.
I wonder what the husbands reaction was when he found 3,000$ missing from his account?
There needs to be more people like this
Very cool very cool. Passed the vibe check
Love this 💚
He stole it. XD
That is so nice.
Good for you kiddo. Good to see young people doing the right thing ❤️
It’s me I was hunting down the milfs
Wonderful 😊!!!!!
He didn’t return the purse to be a Good Samaritan, he returned the purse because he thought he could get a reward, not because he thought he was doing a good thing. Come on. He’s a teenager for christs sake.
I love this, very inspiring
It's nice to see a ring doorbell photo that doesn't involve a crime.
Hats off to this young man! Like his parents, I am so proud of him. He will grow up to be an honorable person and citizen of our country. God bless him!
Good man!
Being a good person pays off in the long run.
Awesome 👏 lucky dude 👏 on both people
Such a great kid
Wow so nice
What a sad world we live in, when doing the right thing is news
EVERYONE TAKE NOTES! Please update your address for within 30 days of moving.
Yes thank you Lord for showing that this young man shows honesty!!
Good news to hear . Way to go
aww that's such a sweet young man! Thank you for what you did, return that woman's purse to her. How do we donate to his fund?
This is a great kid.
You know why this is celebrated, because the opposite is the norm which is sad. But with evil people in all the positions of power that's the world you get. But to get back to positive his parents should be very proud.                                                                                    GRIM
I remember when i found this ladies purse in compton i took it to her she gave me 5 knotts berry farm tickets bro i had fun with my cousins and brother
Such a good deed I hope the right government organisation will give him a job or send him to College.
Love hearing stories like this something that's not negative! Great answer from that kid not to sound religious it sounds like Jesus second commandment love your neighbor as yourself or don't do something to somebody that you wouldn't want done to yourself! And I'm glad they gave him a nice reward besides a bag of Reese's cups and a Starbucks cups and a bag like they did that guy that worked at Burger King for 27 years! Love a happy story
Wow amazing
This is the kind of news we need at 5 O'clock and 10pm !
Awh what a good guy. Truly refreshing to see stuff like this.
Shiet all i got was a thank you
When I was 17, I lost my wallet on a train in DC, with all my cash and my debit card and drivers license inside. About five hundred dollars cash. I was devastated because I was on a school trip and no longer had any money. I had saved for that trip for an entire year. When I got home, my wallet still full of cash was in the mailbox with no return address. Whomever sent it back to me didn't want any reward or credit for it. It restored my faith in humanity which even at 17 had taken a hit. People can be truly good.
He is a good looking guy and he is respectful and humble . And the way he dress just shows that  don't judge a book by its cover.
Wow! Soo reel!!
Iv done this before the old lady said her social security money was in there she had just cashed the check she offered me $40 i said no thank you.
That was nice of him I would do the same sometimes Depends on how my day was
That kid was raised by good responsible parents. Thumbs up to you kid
Love it! I pray to raise a son this kind a considerate
soild work brother u understood the assingnment
I 've returned 3 cell phones, two wallets and some ID. One cell was equivalent to $2900 in today's money. The delivery guy left it on his roof. The company gave me $100 and wanted it  right away even though I told them I would meet up with them, they came to get it.   A cell phone kept ringing when my friends and I were chatting on a side street near a restaurant we were at. I thought the phone was left on a porch by accident. I rang the doorbell and told the guy he left his phone on the porch. The old guy berated me and told me he would never own such a "new fangled" thing and to take it and go. It rings again and I answer..."Who is this??" "It's the guy who found the phone"  We talked and he showed up with a bottle of wine. They had been at the same restaurant and dropped the phone on the way to the car and a good Samaritan thought it belonged to the grumpy old guy.  The thrid one, I found in a snowbank. I pick it up and it's unlocked. I call "home" no answer. I scroll through the names and lo and behold, I find my friends name in the contact list, so I call him. He answers and we talk a bit and I said "Uhh, whose phone am I calling you from?" It's a hockey buddy. So I told him I have the phone if he talks to him. I go home almost 40 minutes away and then call his house one more time. The wife answers. I told her what happened and she said "OH YEAH? WELL YOU WAIT UNTIL THAT A-HOLE GETS HOME, HE YELLED AT ME FOR LOSING MY PHONE!!" The guy calls me back and I told him where I was. The next day was Christmas and he had to come within minutes of his house to get his mother in law, picked up the phone and gave me $20.  All the other returns were to the right address, but they were young kids that lost their wallets/IDs and their parents took the wallets and IDs while berating their kids and closed the door in my face...
He drives an Audi. No reason to take the purse.
I hope he gets to smash them too
激レアやな
crazy that people make a huge deal because someone did what their supposed to do.
Huh!!?? Imagine that!!?? Trump was wrong about who is immigrating! A good kid being raised by a good mom. He is more honest than our Supreme Court Judges.
W manz
I love this 💕
Invest that money in the stocks get out the rat race.
Aww that's so sweet 💕
I once saw a debit card in an ATM at a former college and instead of taking it, I took it straight to Public Safety and gave them all the information asked. Felt good.
Broo ima need his number😭
Im sorry but i will never will do this for someone. At work i found 2 purses in separate occasions in the trash so i looked thru them so i could find a number or some type of way to get in touch. Money was gone, cards were gone but there was pictures, receipts and personal things i thought they may want back... so i get a hold of them and let them know where the purses were at..... they showed up with a cop .. both of them implying i was the thief. One said, "idc if you keep the money just give me back the cards and ID"... so nah not everyone is as appreciative.
What a wonderful young man! Thank God all young people aren't crazy! Thankfully he was not only raised right but he's living the way he was raised!
This is a prime example of how to not judge a book by its cover or a person by what they wear and their ethnicity. Great job to this kindred heart. ❤
God Bless Him 😁
Awesome young man!
Kudos to MOM  that raised this boy RIGHT!!!!! GOOD JOB ADRIAN!!!!! 👍
This is how our society is Supposed to work.
Love this
His mama taught him right he's a good boy there was nothing in it for him to return it to you except doing the right thing for someone and treating people the way he would want to be treated what a great kid I hope you raise $10,000 for him he's the best
We need to clone him and get rid of the other garbage..............
Finally some wholesome news
Sounds like a GoFundMe scam. Damn, I’m cynical 🤨
My boyfriend lost his celphone.. after an hour someone knocking the door.. A young man looking for Richard (my bf name). He returned the celphone. So, we gave him a 200$ reward. 😊
great parenting i would love to give his parents a cruise ship if i had money
One time I found a purse and someone's car belongs strewn about in the snow. Found out who's address by the checkbook. Returned it and I was met with vile hostility and almost beaten up as a 13 year old. So I did a good deed and didn't get anything in return. Where's my reward?
I Believe we do have a lots of people like this young man. Its awesome that he's being recognized and rewarded.
But when I do it I get jail time 😤
This is due to great parenting👍
Most adults don’t act like this teenager. He’s literally the example we need to follow.  Edit: Teen
What a chad
Is no one going to talk about how sad it is that this makes the news? It would never cross my mind to keep something of that nature I've found and I wish everyone was the same. Well done though to this guy
He seen her pretty picture and wanted to meet her 🤣
What would he have done if he saw a white lady on the ID.
Good deeds pay off. I lost my wallet with my entire paycheck and received my wallet, however it was empty. Lesson learned. Never carry cash like that.
That’s so awesome 👏🏻. My husband lost his wallet & the wallet was turned in with his License & credit cards but the $750 in cash was stolen.  We ended up canceling the credit card for safety precautions.  He only had that much cash on him cause he just got paid that day.  So ya 50/50 win not having to go to the DMV.
thats nice
So sad this is looked at as extraordinary and not the norm.
Love to see it!!!
this makes me so happy to see bro. young men doing the right thing and setting examples we can all learn from.
😭
What an amazing kid!!! Young man, you're going places!
It speaks a lot about him and the parents that raised him. Amazing job to the parents and a sweet kid for doing the right right. It doesn’t go unnoticed 👏
Really good guy. Never judge a book by its cover.
I have so much enduring hope in the following generations. There will always be a lot of darkness, but one bright light can illuminate the universe.
Its like a wanted poster but he get paid 🫠😂
A lot of people lack integrity these days, but I'm glad to see some still have it.
good job 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼❤️🙏
Wow God bless that kid!!! Speaks VOLUMES of his mom or parents
I love his first name.
Smash
fact that people praise this... yup society ain't nothing but a bunch of inconsiderate thugs and thieves. This is what being a normal human being looks like kudos to the 17 yr old for doing what your suppose to do
I would also return the bag, if I saw an id with a pretty face in it
Wiw
Dude stole it and returned it hoping for a prize 💀
He looked, the purse only had 5 dollars cash and a bunch of other useless stuff and decided to return it with the hopes of getting a reward.  Just kidding, congrats to the young man for doing the right thing.
God sees you, young man 💞 Thank you for the hope in humanity 🙏 I'm also sporting a huge smile 😃 thank you
Good job for the young man
Proud parents of this young man…god bless
AWWW🥰ALL I CAN DO IS "JOY"CRY😢 FOR THAT YOUNG MAN HE DEFINITELY LISTENED WELL TO HIS MOTHER🙏🏾BLESS HIS HEART!!!
That’s her son they split the $ 😂😂😁👍🏿😁
I love that he did the right thing but the fact that he got a positive reinforcement is a great cherry on top.
Way to take care of one another! This made me smile. Thanks for sharing.
He was tryna get the pipe down
No way my name is Melina
Great awesome stupendous job kid…mom raised you right
Need more people like this young man
My wallet fell out my car while driving. Didn't know. Someone called my apartments, verified my info and got my number. Went way out the way to return my items was extremely grateful
He wanted Gawk
A credit goes to inside edition too . Because of you , we came to know .
That is a kid with some character!  I give props to him and his parents!
Keep up the good work even if no one is watching..... 😀
No cema cuh kid
Just a guess but he was probably raised probably by loving parents
Good to him.
Awesome kid!!
Finally some ❤ heart warming and good news!
edgar doing good deeds lol
...nearly $4000 bit too much though. But good kid.
Much love
He definitely hit that.
Wonderful young man! Product of good parenting!
If was a black kid he would be dead as. Soon he ringed the bell  . Facts
Fantastic!
He deserves that and more
That’s wassup
this made me cry but for happiness 😊 and proud of the young man 🥰🙏
Such a sweet soul
good on him!! so nice to see the young ones these days still have morals. ,👍
That’s an expensive purse lol
what a good kid
Yes, thank you young man you did 👍😊 there's hope people
This is like a random event in gta
I found a wallet with like 600 bucks in it one time Went through so much trouble of contacting the guy He was just some rich 21 year old and I barely got a thank you
Wow!  That young man has the makings of a democrat.  Well done!
“There’s hope for our younger generation!”  Dang, I felt that one
YOUNGSTERS TAKE NOTE: THIS IS WHAT A WINNER LOOKS LIKE!
Kudos kid! Never judge a book by its cover
…hats off to that young gentleman for doing the right thing!
He didn't have to do that he should've just went in a fishing tournament and he might win $3k lol I'm kidding
Such a good boy.....
wooo
never judge a book by its cover. This kid is making a difference
This is unrelated but I literally have an uncle named Adrian Rodriguez.
This is beyond surprising, I’m proud of bro!
He is good. We must protect this young lad
Never judge a book by its cover.
He deserved to take the 3k and spend it gracefully… he deserves it. Good job 👍
The kid is pure class and character personified. I bet he was shocked he got $3000 for the good deed.
He deserves it! Awesome young man
He's lucky because  I've returned a ton of things, helped people on the side of the road and given plenty of people my last dollar and never got no more than a thank you. This was very nice of them and I'm proud there's actually  some good young people  out there.I raised my kids to do the same thing.
Hats off to Adrian Rodriguez for this outstanding return
Finally, happy stories💕🙏
Instead of saying we need more people like this, how about saying I will strive to be more like this person?  More good people in society begins with you
Take her find a on a date
He's tired of karens yelling at him.
atta kid
This is how real men should be.
Good mf boi ❤️
Want a fine young man! Never stop doing the right things! 👌👍👏
They gave him more than 3k😂 they gave him some special treatment
You lucky the bag found was from a woman and she hot , you still be praying for a miracle if he found some money and a guys ID , i think my guy wanted to score that night LOL
Shout out to the good young man
This is what the world needs, thanks young man, you'll be a great man, and a good father if you ever have kids. Pass the knowledge and the good values that your parents thought you.
“Theres hope for the younger generation”  The younger generation: leaking old peoples credit card info after taking their rights like a boss
I hope Mrs. Martin gave home boy alittle sumthin sumthin for his good deed 😂
That kid has tegridy
Thought this was normal.
Ilove this.
He treated them like he wanted to be treated there is hope for young ones today
That’s a good kid right there
Great story !!!
its nice to see a good person for a change.
Good on ya, & your mum
And look at his appearance most people would think he’s a thug like they say don’t judge a book by it’s cover shoutout to him💯🙏
There’s no hope
Very kind. 👍
Well done young man.. not it’s time to dress like a decent human being which you define it.
I've always been told do good by other and life will do good by you ..this is a great example.
Hearing stories like this warms my heart ❤️ I haven’t lost all faith in humanity
He deserves it. No one returns stuff anymore.
It's good to see some parents still raising their children the right way nowadays with these kids they have no respect and it's just atrocious glad to see that I'm a 62 year old man and I'm glad to see something like that
If it was me, I wouldn't want the news broadcasting that I received that much money. People have done horrible things for much less. Same reason I can't stand the lottery posting people who won.
God bless him and his family
but well hes driving an Audi, that helps
Can I hang out with dis dude. I'm new to Cali from SC trying to chill wit only da good crowds. Hmu!
When parents, parent.
See just because he dresses like a gang member or punk doesn’t mean he is one aka never judge a book by its cover
Here kid take this W
May this kid be blessed with a long, healthy life 🙏🌹
That’s amazing 🙏
Where can I find a random purse? $3,000? 😭😭 I’ll happily return that bag 💼 and people say money doesn’t cause happiness… okay. Well give it to me 🤲🏾
This is only news because he’s not white
take a good like boys this skinny man is more man than u will ever be
Good boy! That's what you call integrity young man. You have more than most adults
And no jail time comes along with doing the right thing... Big plus ➕ 🙌
His mom raised him right!  He has good morals due to his upbringing.  Good KARMA came back to him and well deserved!
W
His parents raised him right....👍
He’s such a sweetheart.
Respect for this guy & these woman's , 💯
I don't have that kinda luck. I left was windows in my car down. Someone took my wallet, change purse, and sandwich.  Another time. My wallet at the gym was taken from my locker.
homie stole it too return it what a chad
Real man!!!!!! ❤️ 😁 Good job, mama!
It’s sad that we have to praise and reward people nowadays for being good honest people. Shows how far off we become as humans. God bless the young man, and I hope he will have many more blessings in his life!
Adrian is my cousin!! So proud of him :))
True hero’s don’t wear capes, usually a hat instead 😂
This should be normal behavior. Kind of sad we’ve gotten to this point in society to be surprised at this sort of thing.
Less go 420 comments.
Good for them all. That young man is a shining example of what is trustworthy in this World. God bless his parents for raising their son with kindness and generosity, and him for being good at heart.
There's still a lot of good people out there. My wife lost her checkbook at a busy grocery store. With a few hundreds in it and stamps. Within a week it arrived in the mail. Nothing missing, they used the stamps only. Grateful to extremely honest persons.
Finally a story about a young person doing something unselfish and not looking for the limelight....well done young man!!
What a legend
Nice
Good job. Honesty makes the world a better place to live in.
I just wanna know how tf do you forget that big bright green purse in a shopping cart lmao
Congrats to him!! Wish him nothing but happiness and also finally some good news today
1. His mom raised him well. 2. I hope to be like him. 3. He must be protected at all costs.
👍😊
Good job kids 👍
hey im 17 as well , bless him!!!!
I love this!!
Good on you man!! Love stories like this  ❤your going to make me cry
Foos gon wild! Or good?
he said he found it in the parking lot  plot twist: their is not enough in the purse so he decided to return it
Outstanding and well done!!!
He didn't do it for rewards, but he got some!
He found a purse, that probably had $100, or whatever was in it, and he was rewarded with over $3000, and counting. ❤️ His reasoning was spot on. Do what you would want done for you.  He was taught well. Awesome job, young man!
Thank you for sharing, such a kind thing to do. God bless his sweet soul
He deserves utmost respect for what he did
Melina and her friend my my lol haha
Good kid. Strong character and integrity
So for doing basic deeds! You need a reward?? Tf
Imagine that: pants sagging gold wearing GOOD guy. There's MANY more like him ✊
What a sad world we live in  when honesty comes as a surprise ! This young man is a real man.
We need good stories like this, there's alot of people like this I think 😂❤
It's sad this is news
I tried to do a good deed today. All I accomplished is crying over spilt milk. Wasted a quarter of a tank of gas following a 🚚 truck driver for miles. I tried to get them to pull over. They was literally spilling gallons worth of what looked like milk out of their trailer. I finally had to stop following them because I ran out of wiper fluid and could no longer see out of my windshield.
Never judge a book by its cover!! Fits this boy to a tee!
We need to Fine young man raised by parents right 😼
He was well rewarded for his honesty! A great example to follow!😁
People keep saying “we need better people in that world.” Be that better person! It’s not hard to do the right thing.
WE need more people like that!
*I ones returned my classmate lost homework to my teacher and I was reported to the principal.*
So nice to hear a positive story for once ☺️
My mom got her purse stolen at a skateboard ng rink and whoever took it had a decent mom because she sent the wallet back  to our address and left a note
Seems like a nice young man.... Shame he has to dress like a thug
Yesssss his momma is raising a good boy 🥺
Bless Him 🥹🥹🥹
His parents raised this kid right! Good job Kiddo!!
Thats how i met your mother!
Great young man!
That's dope
He did a good thing.
He was raised right, good job Adrian.
I would of done the same thing too give 5k tho if I lost something valuable
I would've settled for having Eliana's phone number as a reward. 🥰
Sometimes it pays off to do good things~
being nice has rewards 😁😁
Kudos to the Kid! ;)
If you was black will be a different story
Soooo wassup Melina?? Good Lawd!!
God bless him!
He practiced the golden rule. And listened to his Mother. What you teach a child matters.
Brace young man
💕💕💕
Nice kid
God bless this Man! 🤗🧡 Also isn't that the purse where the Thiefs stole it from her hands while the thiefs rode on a morticycle on the sidewalk?
You guys in USA have serious problems in society if something like this is so unusual and become national news
BitLife
god bless this dood
Awesome ❤️ 👌
Proof good parenting works
GTA side missions be like:
Please share more stories like this
Forget the reward get on ur knees mami and fix em.  And btw i just farted
The first 6 words out of her mouth were the biggest lie I ever heard.
always do a good even when someone isnt watching bc you know someone could always be watching
W bro
Respect 🫡
Yea sure let's gofindme for anything these days
Damn I would have just left the purse at the store lost and found.
Sweet kid.
I would have turn down the money. Can’t put a price on my ego.
This was the best news I’ve seen in a long time
I really like they were grateful. I've done the right thing a lot of times and couple times I didn't even get a thank you.
God bless this young man his parents did a great job raising him.
Damn, lady on the right with the accent is hot 🔥 🔥
God watching heyyy Yahweh!
This is sooooo sweet
Don’t judge a book by it’s cover. Wonderful kid much respect
♥️♥️♥️♥️
win win for both, she got the purse back, and he got a bunch of money.
Parent sure known how to raise him
Does the woman doing the majority of the talking knows she has a  clear lump on the left side of her throat? I'm not a doctor & please don't hate for it but please have it checked out!.
Foosgonwild
Don’t judge a book by its cover.
I love this!!!
Good*
Goof lad
What a good dude, God bless him🙏🤍🕊💯
"the women also had a surprise for him"  me: oh yeah my mans gettin some action 😮
Good job young man 🙏🏽❤️
Wow what a good boy. He's so trustworthy. 😀👍🏻
Good kid. Someone was raised right
Wow! Looks like the Good Lord was watching all those involved. Mom, you raised your son to be a good man. May the bless all those involved and you may think nobody is watching, but The good Lord is watching.
Very, very cool!!!!!!! Right on, man. Makes my heart happy 😊
He damn sure doesn't live in East Dayton Ohio. These mofos think ppl doing things for them is typical. Nasty mother f*covers around here!
this boy was raised well his parents must be proud of him 🎉
It's a simple good deed but it's nice to see some people still do the right thing.
Misleading title
Shout outs to them for giving him 3k!!! Some people would just give a “thank you “
I remember I was at work once and I went outside to the smoking area on my break and there was a wallet sitting on the bench. I opened it up and there was so much cash inside. I get the guy was at the casino but I've never seen anyone carry that much cash in their wallet. Had to be about 4 or 5 grand. The wallet would barely close. Anyway I checked the ID and saw that it was a guy I know. I didn't know him well, basically knew his name and had never had conversation with him beyond maybe a "hi" here and there. Anyway I went inside and saw him and said "Hey Steve you left your wallet outside. He didn't even say "thank you". Haha not because he was a jerk but I think it was because he was so shocked. He just looked at me with a stunned look on his face and his jaw slightly dropped. I was like "alright man cya". He was definitely in shock that someone would return the wallet with so much money inside. Of course I'm NOT a Saint because I honestly don't know what I would have done if the wallet belonged to someone I didn't know. I would like to think I would have returned it but I just don't know. I will say if it was someone I knew who I didn't like because they're a total ass then I wouldn't have returned it. Well, I would have wanted him to get the wallet back so I would have taken the money and left the wallet and im sure someone would have returned the wallet since there was no money inside.
aww
Now that's a good man right there. We should follow in hos footsteps
Lol I returned some one wallet once, I got nothing LOL.  This guy is lucky
He’s a good kid!
we don't need more people like this, rather, we should be like the way he is.
Beautiful story
Hell yes!
Good for him, I’m glad he did the right thing
Fine with a great heart ❤ You make those around you proud 👏🏽
I guess there's hope for our use after all
Well done bud.. Honesty is the best Policy..way to go and you gain much Respect! Parents will be so proud...👍🙏
He's kute!
Kids gonna be on a t-shirt in a couple years hopefully not even. Can tell by the the stance and looks, but what can you do with this new generation. Honestly it’s time to bring back bullying and have a crusade.  😮‍💨💨✌🏻
Lucky stiff that's nice of him to do that
Love this ❤️
That’s so nice that he got recognized for his good deeds. Imagine returning a purse to someone thinking it was a simple and kind gesture, and getting a huge award for it!
It's amazing that he did that and amazing that they rewarded him. I've had someone do that for me a long time ago when all my rent money was in my wallet and I was a broke 17 year old in my first apartment. My dad had me offer a reward then but the lady wouldn't take it!
That's the kind of guy I want my son to be like. What a good kid!
❤️ good job Adrian!!! ❤️
It speaks VOLUMES on how he was raised! So refreshing!!!🌟
He is being raised well
Thats her aunt??? She fine af!!! Id give it to her good🥵
This is how we fight evil. Just do good deeds
Wish i was this honest
This is Sara corbello his mom must be proud of him I know lot of teens probably won't do want he did
Finally. Something good happened from the youth for once.
But how do u know where to find he person or know who it is or even know where they live or the house they live in he can’t just knock every door and doorbell
As of right now: "$4,915 raised of $1,000 goal"
🇲🇽 pride. Respect
Any time I lose my wallet I wish someone would return it, because I would reward them as well and we both walk away good people. Never has happened though. Lost 400 once and was going to give whoever returned it 100. Had my wallet stolen with over 700 in it as well. I don't understand how people don't feel bad keeping it for themselves or stealing it. I could never. Not to mention having to replace cards and ID is a pain.  Edit: Bravo on the young man for doing the right thing, and his mother for raising her son so well
😊
Wish the media focused on stuff like this more often.
Beautiful story ♥️
Ok don’t get me wrong… this kid could have felt bad and returned it or he genuinely found it in a parking lot with all the belongs?

That young man is already a success! May Life reward him many times over.
So cool
See Inside Edition, this is the type of news we want to see. Not the communist/socialist propaganda you always feed us
I think he saw her I.D and just wanted to smash.. he said better than the purse he gets a sugar momma
His parents raised him well
Raised well. That why can judge a book by its cover. He deserved it
and he’s fine
This is why we don't judge a book by its cover. People like this changing with the world with one Act of Random Kindness 🙌
Aww I love stories like this. God bless that young man🙂
Viva La Raza Cabrones
That young man is a walking W
Look at how he’s dressed. Don’t judge a book by its cover. Good Samaritans don’t wear suits or robes.
Beautiful child of beautiful mom
Eliana is gorgeous 👀
He tryna get at eliana
Golden rule treat others how you want to be treated good job young man
God richly bless him!
In the pArrKInG lot???........
Finally they show the good teenagers in this world , I’m the same age as him🙏🏾
That’s awesome.   Need more acts like this
That's an Amazing story!
That's right good for him. He didn't even expect anything in return but got such blessing. God always positions us were we need to be.
It’s nice to see some good news. Great job young homie.
Nowadays mostly people will not give back to owner. Good kids
Excellent Young Man!! Integrity At It’s Finest!! 👏👏👏 💯🙂
A True Young King!💪🏽💯🙏🏽
This guy has some great integrity and an amazing mother. Great on him!
That lady was frozen still

Awesome...great example of humanity at it's best on both parts of the people involved.🙏✌👍🤙👏
His parents raised him right.
Jesse...we need to cook
Back in the day my girl lost her flip phone and it had a lot of photos of our oldest daughter when she was a newborn. 2 years+ of memories lost just like that, her sweet 16 is coming up soon too and we would loved to put some of her baby photos in the slide show including the ones we took from the hospital,glad this dude did the right thing.
Que dios te vendiga .Adrian 🙏👏
always be kind, good karma
So cool!!
Good kid. I hope he reads these comments and sees the  happiness he gave to thousands of people by his good choice. He must have a wonderful mom (good job mom) 👍  he deserves his reward and most of all respect. He's a better man at 17 than most people my age 39 😆
His mom raised him right👏🏽!!
What a idiot, should have kept the purse like me
👏👏👏👏👏What A Great Kid THIS WORLD NEEDS MORE OF HIMS 🥰🥰
😮3K just for being a Good Samaritan & returning a purse😊😂
wow, see i would have gave it to the store for them to hold on to he really did go out of his way. Thank God for some good news
That's how I raise my son with honesty and integrity!
I think we all know why he returned the purse * wink wink *
This kid must have watch a lot of Japanese video  good guy
I love this!
What a great human being, Great parenting just great all around
Imagine you were about to steal a purse containing 20 bucks in it but last minute you decided to do the right thing and well this happened (not saying he had this mindset but like what if someone did)
Faith in humanity restored for another day. You just know this kid's brought up right by parents with good moral values. We need more people like that in this country.
Thats Right Eseee.!!🔵🔵🔵
Good kid 😊👍
Sounds like this was a setup to make money on gofundme
The good thing you put inside of the world always has a way to come back to you
That's a nice reward for a selfless act🫶🏾
Beautiful story
When people see more video like this, they will mimic his actions.  If people watch other videos with the wrong message, they will mimic them also.  The reason is because the video stimulates something in us, no matter good or bad.  So, we need to submerge ourselves in videos like these to become a good person.  I hope you understand what I'm trying to say here.  This isn't a full proof system, but it's almost garneted to work.  When you can control your emotions, you will win in life.
Thank GOD it was another Spanish family. Had it had been a white family they would have shot him or assumed he was a thug.
❤️
This is the kind of news I want to see. 👏🏻 Such a good man. ♥️
This happened to me about 8 years ago and till this day I'm greatful. I couldn't believe the guy brought it all the way to my house. I'm happy people like this still exists, this young man is truly a gentleman.
Always teach your kids to do the right thing and be respectful to others. Great parenting and God bless this young man he will do wonderful things in life with his good spirit!
FINALLY, some GOOD NEWS 🗞️ ‼️ To the HONEST Good Samaritan 💯 You're the Best 🎖️
Pure soul!
Nice story. Needed this story today!
Even when no ones watching,God is watching and the reward with him is priceless
How do you tag someone? They said San Diego. Someone tag faze rug?
Great kid & great reward. It’s such a hassle to lose a wallet or phone and it’s uplifting.  We get so much bad news everyday, so it’s nice to see positive things.
What a law-abiding citizen thing to do.
Good boy 🙏
he is a good man!
Adrian is a hero👍❤
Curious if she’s checked out her thyroid? Looks enlarged
Nice for him but not enough in this world
Adrian, you’re an amazing person!
she look like a movie star that does licky stuff...did he get some after?
They still have good kids out there
Its sad that this is surprising to people. This should be normal
I love this. So little good in this world. Made me tear up.
Now this is a kid that was raised right!!! I loved to see parents who raise their children with morals and values!!! Good job kid!! 👍👍👍
Most people would steal a purse but he actually did the right thing  Why aren't there alot of people like this
They hustled the news with a fake story lmao
Karma
I still wouldn't risk it. We live in a terrible time in our society where people make judgments based on your looks and assume the worst of each other. Had somebody seen him take the purse, they could have easily assumed it wasn't his, and he fits the stereotype of a criminal in most people's eyes, and the cops wouldn't ask any questions. I'm sure they wouldn't have beleived his story, as I'm sure many theirs have used the I'm returning it to its owner excuse. We're living in a sad time when even doing the right thing can backfire.
Even though it’s clearly the right thing to do, the sad part is most people wouldn’t, the reason I know is basically I’ve lost so many purses and phones in my life and I only had a phone returned to me once. That’s why this is a news story in this country, it’s especially shocking because he was a teenager. Even grown adults who have their brains fully formed won’t do this 😟 he deserves the reward
He deserves the donation!
Hero!!!
dont judge a book by its cover
Theres hope for our younger generation? so any teens or kids werent thought to actually do any..... Never Mind
He was taught well.  He deserves a reward for doing the right thing.  Wish there were more Adrians in the world instead of people who want to do evil.  God is blessing this young man for his honesty.
Maybe there is HOPE for Us Americans after all , honest ppl still exist
There’s still honest & good people in the world! I believe there’s more good then bad out there 🙌 Oh & always listen to your mother 😉
This is exactly why you always return it instead of taking anything valuable out of it because the person in question might just reward you for returning it to them
That’s not the only reward he got 😂👍
Oh damn what if this was set up for some money. Damn.
What a great kid! Good job!
YES! Young man is on his way to a good life
Great young fella!
something tells me when this kid turns 18 he will be back ;)
Good man right there.
What an Awesome kid! the parents did an AMAZING job!
Respect to him 😎
nice job
👍
I remember when i was a kid and found a wallet with a few hundreds in it. I dicided it was the right choice to return it. I was really hungry so i took a $5 and bought me a water and a burger at kwik trip. Lol
Impressed ✨this is a good kid
Take me out on a date  !
He should’ve piped.
Respect to that young man and his family 💕💕🥰🥰🙌🙌🙌 may blessings always come to him!
That's very rare. That's Good parenting
THE HUMAN RACE IS ALREADY FKED, WHEN JUST RETURNING A PURSE IS LIKE CURING CANCER
This warms my ❤
Cool
Happy newss... Always makes me smile with a Hope.. 😊
JesusLoves You And died for you turn to Jesus christ and spread his gospel not forcing
he's kinda cute💀
plot twist: thats her son and its all staged just to set up a go fund me to get free money.
Good for him! He's a good kiddo.
Gofund me page?
Not gonna lie, I would have not returned the purse😅
Beautiful!!!
Thats so nice n honestly im proud of him
We still have hope for the future generation
thatd be funny if he ran a scam where he returns all the money on purpose so they give him something. and we all got double duped
God bless this boy.
That was so awesome. I hope life is kind to this young man
Such a nice thing on both sides
Awesome ❤️👌
What a nice person! Florida needs some nice people now haha. We need more ppl like this!
damn he is the most thug lookin good teen...
This makes me very happy
I’ve found & returned wallets and cellphones and never got a reward 😭
Awesome teen. I’d like to be his friend!
Mad respect for this man 👏
Proof that honesty and politeness can go a very long way.
Ok
I am going to make a donation to this Kid. Nice he is up to 4900.00 right now.
Homie knew he would get a reward 😂 smart man
We need people like this young fellow right here. He was raised well. Never steal.
This guy has integrity in his heart!
This is what an American does for their neighbor.
F**k that I would have left that purse right where it was at to be stolen. Going out the way to be a Good Samaritan has the stupidest idea in 2022. Instead of saying we need more people like him how about have accountability for your personal belongings.
Thank you, Adrianne, for showing other people (especially teens) how to be in the world!  You have a beautiful heart!  May your life be deeply blessed, and may your dreams come true.
I love the aunts accent 🥰
Good job young man I'm proud of you. I pray you're  blessed with a long happy life.
God is watching
Always reward good behavior
that lady on the right would sooo get it lmao
What a nice person! Florida needs some nice people now haha. We need more ppl like this!
How do you get on inside edition?
Awesome young man! Excellent job mom!
It all starts at home!  His parents must be very proud of him!  Great job young man
Finally. Usually people never give a award. They say thank you... thats it.
SD? Home!
Well done! At least he didn't steal it, so he is blessed.
A child that’s raised well! Awesome to see that!
Proud of that kid.
YAY!!! There is hope!
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🙏🏼✌🏼❤️
Nice to see a feel good story during these chaotic times
wow
We need more people like this in the world 👏🏼
What a good child!
Such a good kid 🥰
bruh
Salute And Respect…🙌👏
That is so nice I hope we get more people like this:)
Gold bless the world 🌎
God bless and thank u to all those good samaritans who’s stories go unheard
Now you'll never know what I commented that everybody thought was good enough to like.
❤️
Great young man. His parents should be incredibly proud!
Now people will be nicking things and returning them later hoping to get a reward    (It's a joke. Good guy :) )
Her plastic surgeon ruined her💀
He could've just dropped it off at a police station..
Obviously raised well hats of to the parent's and the lad
Bless this man!!!
yassssssss
