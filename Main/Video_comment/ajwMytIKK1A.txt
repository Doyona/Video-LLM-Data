“You said you’ll never dye your hair pink again, why’d you change your mind?”   *namjoon head scratch* UH-
I love when Suga answer questions :'3
it's about the relationship not the religion ✨🤍
2:21
We purple you handsome boys
JAYKAY-AY.
EU SENDO BRASILEIRA E NÃO SPIKA INGLÊS  🤡
BTS
Just my opinion, but the interview is... A bit dull ngl? The questions lack of depth and kind of repetitive with other interviews, and the response from the interviewer is just a bit forced (that "I love McDonald's!"😂) There's this video showing parts of the job of being a manager of them and its3 mentioned that they have 10 interviews that day. TEN INTERVIEWS. Imagine they are all asking similar things. Again just my opinion tho.
🎶Smooth like butter 🎵
BTS !!
1:34 NOT THE EXCUSES 😆😆😆
Hobi mind*when are we going home I’m bored 😑😒😐
i got my bts meal last week
Savage Joon 😂😂😂
1:30 “Joon” ? 😊
Jhope is not paying attention
Who else loves bts💙💚💜💛❤??  .  .  I made a cover of this
I always enjoy sxm interviews with BTS- they always ask interesting questions! Thanks for sharing!
We love pink Joonie and I am thankful that you changed your mind, Namjoonssi 🥺💜

McJimin my next aim...hemmm
Did I miss something lol why was Namjoon laughing so hard in 1:26 was their an inside joke or was he just done!
I purple BTS
..
2:12 Interviewer: Do you use a lot of butter in your cooking back home? Namjoon: HELL YEAH! HELL YEAH! me: don't lie joon. no one even lets you in the kitchen
JK...when you sway like that, I can't get a clear screenshot.
namjoon: DID I?
"Do you use a lot of butter in your cooking back home?"  Everyone: "yeah. Sure. Ofc."  Namjoon: "HELL YEA, HELL YEAH, HELLS YEAHHHH, HƏŁĹ ÝÊÆHHH"
Did you call him Joon? JOON ???JOON
Hahaha I laughed hard when Namjoon said only God Knows, when he's an atheist... No hate I love all of them
Love you BTS from INDIAN ARMY 🇮🇳
Namjoon becoming all flustered and starting to stutter trying to give a rational explanation about his pink hair just sends me 🤣🤣   Come on pink hair joon is hot why question it just take in the beauty 😍😍😘😘 let the man breath with his pink hair 😂😂
💜💜💜
JOON
Surprised, Jungkook is wearing "Batik". Batik is traditional identity in Indonesia
I love how interviewers are slowly starting to call joon “JOON” 😭😭😭
BTS WORLD DOMINATION ....I love you so much BTS.
Best forever
🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿💜💜💜💜💜
Army Algeria 🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿💜💜💜
Butter is better than Dynamite (my opinion)
RM being atheist Also RM: Only god knows
“Do you use a lot of butter in your cooking back home?” 😐 I’m sorry but I’ve heard this bland question so many times in these American interviews. All these Western interviews got me disappointed. Good job, BTS, for pulling through.
https://youtu.be/OyrR0Q_zAlw the best part in mv 😂❤️
اخخخ يخي احب زوجي تاي.،
Popular opinion: RM AS TOPIC IN THIS COMMENT SECTION
shut up he call namjoon - joon. aaa
*namjoon pink hair*
The fact that in BTS is that ..... Namjoon only know English fluently  So they made RM as the leader  Anyone Agrees.... I don't mean. ...that they don't know English..... But a step forward is RM
I love you guys  Jhope  Rm Suga V Jin Hyung Jiminaaaa Jungkook
We also want bts meal of McDonald's in Pakistan 🥺🥺
🐇🐇🐇
💜
No cause I’m still tying to catch up with all the interviews in one day 😭
Important🚨  Mcdonald’s has a partnership with Isra*el, so the money you’ll pay will be turned into weapons that are used to kill, torture, traumatize and blind CHILDREN. A purple bag and some chicken nuggets aren’t more important than people’s lives so pls DONT get the bts meal and boycott Mcdonald’s.  bts aren’t just the most successful group right now, they’re also millionaires, they don’t need u to buy their meal
they're just poppin random questions not in relation with the question they asked just before!!??
They're so cute😭
Why they use "usher" in it...is there any reason particular reason??? Anyone knows??
That’s true only God knows 😭
*People change* I feel like that’s going to be a new thing for us
4 of.. don't mind me. Juz counting how many interviews BTS did to promote BUTTER! 💜
Interviewer: are there any food you look forward to having when in US Hobi: mcdonalds Sprite: but i.... Tae: mcdonalds Panda express: left the chat..
Omg my favorite part is  smooth l like butter like a criminal undercover to
Namjoon so cute when they asked about his pink hair
I purple #BTS
you’re interviewing the biggest boy band in the whole world and all you ask are dumb questions ?? ‘what do you look forward to eating in us?’ seriously ? do you not have any good questions? they’ve been asked such similar questions so many times, try to be more creative ?? no wonder i hate then western industry.
Thank you! BTS, love you so much!
People should listen to RM and WALE's change!
He called him JOON :(( awe
i really love how RM answer the tour dates questions "maybe, only God knows haha" broo thats deep
<33
Thanks for this interview! It was nice ~
Jungkook memakai batik dan aku sangat suka melihatnya. Sangat indah ♡
2:58 just hobi being himself from here to end of thao video😭🥺😚🤧
please subtitle Portuguese  from Brazil
Joonie is my new savage bias. I thought Suga was my inner beast but da-ymn Yoonie is so done with lame questions. V  is definitely not vibing with many of the interviewers. Like Suga and Jimin are definitely Joonie’s saviors. This promo tour on video is just the pits for BTS. What a bunch of hard workers to promo Butter. They have to get the Grammys this time around. Putting it out there in the universe
We love pink Joon
“How we’re attractive as individuals and as a team” YES NAMJOON YESSSSSSS
“Only god knows “
I purple BTS
نامججججججججججوووووووووووووووووووننننن
My fave line is Ushers too 😅
You can tell there's a lot of fake ARMYs because the amount of clueless people that think Namjoon is still atheist. People can change their beliefs and he clearly did when he thanked God after the online concert. I guess ya'll missed that? If he's acknowledging God, you should respect that and stop calling him atheist like he's required to be that.
No entendí lo que dijeron :( pero los amo mucho I LOVE YOU BTS
Are there more parts to this?
PLEASE STREAM BUTTER ON SPOTIFY!!!  WE WILL GET #1 FOR THEM AS A GIFT!!!
1billion views before bts 8th anniversary (13th june) let's GOOOO
How many interviews are there some one tell me?
My babies :3
Love my guys .....ugh ..💜 cant help but smile when u see them
Jimin looks so cute in this interview
I just picture vegans "plant butter" every time they talk about butter hahaha
Who is John? Am I just mishearing what he is saying?
사랑해 ~~~~BTS💜
Yoongi is so cute. His face is like he's getting younger by the day!
Nội dung rất là ĐẸP TRAI =))))))
ngl the way he said joon triggered me a bit... idk why tho
RM: We are trying show our charm, how we're attractive, as an individual and as a team.  ARMYs: Damn right, you're attractive! 😂  But more than that, this is a real catchy and high-pitched song! Congrats, boys!
박지민...........너무 이뻐...............
omg when the interview called rm joon i’ve never heard someone say that to him before
joon saying "HELL YEA, HELL YEA" is my new religion, who's in
2:21 People make fun of me for putting butter on rice but... my bias does it sooo I don't care anymore.
Them talking about the pink hair and him going "oh, did I say that" makes me appreciate the interviewer because he actually has a good question.
i have never heard namjoon openly cuss he’s always been so discreet about it💀
0:47 .....bb arent u atheist..
*thank you for this interview!* 😊
Namjoon being extra af in every butter interview 😎😂
BTS WORLD DOMINATION
okay but seriously if covid ends bts will be on their plane already travelling to the first touring city lmaoo but i aint complaining this panorama gotta go bc if i dont go to a bts concert before i die i have officially failed life😃👍🏾
Interviewer: so, Namjoon you said that you never gonna dye your hair pink again   Namjoon: people changes.
Namjoon is so cool
Namjoon's voice is heaven
I love butter toooo

BTS BUTTER INTERVIEW IN MY WALL IS EXCEED INFINITY  !!!!  I'M SCREAMINGGGGGGG

Armys love to see savage namjoon💓.
https://youtu.be/oO48TQSXV2Y
Taehyung is so cute and beautiful I'm melting. 💜
For the first time they all have a same favorite lyrics 😁
McDonald’s partout sauf en France 🤡🤡
Everybody talking, v and jimin, imma sit and act cute
Why do they look like they are fed up of these interviews 😂 Answering the same qns again n again Spcly NAMJOON😂🤚
Things are getting BETTER  because BTS gave us "BUTTER"😍
There's no lock down in NZ, wish they would come back again... also their McD meals are going to be in 50 countries but not NZ either! >< being kiwi army is rough!
why not ask them about the meaning of their music? about their creative process? their fashion? their dancing? idk, something with more substance? not all the questions in this interview are bad, but you have the chance to talk to bts and you ask them what food they like to eat in the us? and if they use butter in their meals? come on! they've been asked the american food question like a million times. most american food is available in korea, too. do you ask british singers the same question?
The greatest advertisers y’all HAHAHAHAHA
Okay... But jk tho... Ugh .
👩: You do guys have a favorite lyrics in Butter?  BTS: Smooth like butter Like criminal undercover  Also RM : just the front line and I love the usher line too  Me: 🤔??? Interview with Tanyna Rad??
Savage Joon is the best joon  Stream butter
HEY! Am proud of you.💜
The unnatural shallot ultrasonically remove because limit contrarily live pace a imminent option. agreeable, lively jaw
Jimin in all butter interviews: why am i even here?😑😑
When namjoon said "Only God Knows"  Like i pray he continues to seek the Lord♡

BTS💜ARMY
1:24 I could literally hear V saying “Panda Express!” 😂
“Only God knows” well God, whenever you’re ready 😊
Hahahaaaaaaa
BTS KINGS
2:17
In every second, you'll just hear Joon's laugh at this interview 😂❤
I love pink Joonnie  💛
Namjoon's excuses are another level xD
Namjoon: did I ? Too cute....
Yoongi interrupting the interviewer 😂 1:12
the way they were all visably annoyed at him calling RM “Joon”, it is RM or Namjoon to you sir...
“only god knows”- says namjoon the atheist. and now i cry.
کاشکی یکی راجع ب اسپرینگ دی باهاشون حرف میزد
Babies miss touring so much :(
Am I tripping or did he just call Nam "John"? 😭
Interviewer: so joon you said you will never dye your hair pink again Joon: uhmmm- Me: caught you in 4k 😙📸
Love you
Did he just say "Joon"? Its RM for you sir!!!!!!!!!
Not RM saying "Hell Yeah" when asked if they use a lot of butter in their cooking back home 😂 2:15

Gracias por reconfortarnos en estos tiempos tan difìciles ♡
Hope things get better so we can reunite again ♡
0:15 RM: show our charms…  So y’all know you’ve been flirting in the whole video 😭🤧
BTS I LOVE YOU
The way the interviewer called namjoon as "Joon" Lmao
joon: only god knows  also joon: being an atheist lol
Butter lets go!!!
RM basically said show our charms and SHOW WE ARE ATRACTIVE
Broooo Just the MC calling RM, Joon like us
Don't yall just love when Joon goes: HELL YEAH!, HELL YEAH!, HELL YEAH!
Jungkook's thumb habit is one of my favorites
Can someone identify their names! I’m new to BTS
Namjoon saying he’ll yeah nearly gave me a heart attack for some reason ♥️
nobody: joon: HELL YEAH! HELL YEAH!
Thank you for asking that question about Namjoon's hair 😂 👍
Yes, you’re indeed very attractive, boys. heueheu 💜
did he just call him JOON!?!?!?!??!?!?
JK looks a little different idk why?
They suck 🤮🤮🤮
wow i like this interview the most, there’s not even a single awkward situation and they are all so respectful and professional🥰
he called namjoon as joon, count your days bro😭😂lmao I'm joking pls
BTS: we all will wearing butter T-shirt Jinkook: Not today
the dj(?) called namjoon 'joon'.. the real names😆
Loving the Namjoon vibes these days he's really rocking all the interviews 💛
*But pinkjoon was really something*  💥✨💗
When namjoon said "maybe there only God knows" omg 😍 we pray the world is going back to normal and seeing them in person not a virtual 😣
"So namjoon, you said that you weren't going to die your hair pink again, why'd you change your mind?"  RM : "Oh did I?... Um...You know...People change :')"  I wish I could get away from confrontations like that😭😭😭
هو المذيعه لابسه سنسال علم فلسطين ولا ايش؟
When he said Joon, I stopped breathing 😳
All I want to know is who is that gourgeus woman interviewing them ?
the way namjoon said "hell yeah" fck im outta here

joon is just so done with same questions khkejje he just answer all question in start before asking bc he know they have same series of question evertime Lol
1:29 He called him  “Joon” 😃 I am flabbergasted beyond words
Joon pink hair story😂😂 but honestly  it how many IVs they had in one day..!?? I know it part of promotion  but l think it too much. Damm  Especially that  90%. Of questions  are same in majority of IVs.  So they had to repeat answers  hundred of time 😑😑😑😑 power to them

When suga said he had memories with Mc Donalds back wen they were trainees ... It was a time when they couldn't buy expensive meals so they bought Mc Donalds and enjoyed eating it together ...I'll think I'll be able to feel that happiness wen I eat Bts meal
When Namjoon said the inspiration for Butter is Bts itself ......yes of course legends get inspired by legends right ?
Namjoon is bias wrecking me so hard throughout especially his excuses for the pink hair. 😭😭😭

1:35 UwU.... Namjoon when he said DID I?  I love that 💜💜
I don't know what should I do. Mc Donald is friends with Israel 😭😭
Can you imagine the casual confidence to just say “Joon”?!?
Namjoon at 0:48: Only *GOD* knows.   Me: *isn't he an atheist?*     Corona might've scared the heck outta NomNom

Omg Joon  look so buff and the savage answer's I do stan the right person. I love him/them.

When Joonie was asked about his hair color. Joonie was like "Did I?" Haha cute. 😍💜

Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit NeedGod.com.
I am in love
RM: HELL YEAH!
The interviewer called him Joon?...
Namjoon: "We're tryna show our charms as individuals and as a team" Me: I was already sold at DNA
I feel like Namjoon is much more comfortable in english interviews! I love the vibe butter era brought!
Okay why i heard John🤔😐Yeahhh!!!!!!!!!People change!!!
The way J-Hope screamed "CHANGE", I'm feeling that's a hint for a future song...

John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
0:59😂look at jhope

1:00 RM telling Yoongi to speak😂
Interviewer 1 got me at 1.40 when he askd the question we armies have had for all this time... Why did Namjoon go back on his words on not colouring his hair pink and have us all killed.. Thank you @siriusxm for asking that question to his face which we anyway cant do in this lifetime atleast🤧🤧
PeOpLe ChAnGe💜🤣
why do some people in the comments want joon to be christian so bad ??? he literally stated in bangbangcon that he has no religion. stop trying to title him something he's not.

Trending #16 here in the UK
Butter, Let’s go !
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.” #LordJesusiscoming

Namjoon on fire I swear the sarcastic king

When RM said GOD KNOWS.... my heart almost melted.. I hope and pray that God lead them all through the way by his grace
2:20 jungkook deep fries beef in butter and still manages to maintain those abs. I eat one potato and end up with another fat roll.
Joon talking about butter  “Its good for your health”  “Its bad for your diet”
Interviewer: what is your favourite place to eat in the US?  BTS: McDonald's! Panda Express: here are divorce documents sign it up
Butter let's go so cute 😋💜
CONGRATULATIONS BTS 💜
Thank you BTS 💜
Minghui Report: The 20-Year Persecution of Falun Gong in China by Minghui Publishing received an award on May 14 from The Independent Book Publishers Association (IBPA), the largest publishing trade association in the United States.   Minghui Report: The 20-Year Persecution of Falun Gong in China won the Independent Book Publishers Association (IBPA)’s Bill Fisher Award.  Divided into 16 chapters, this 437-page book documents the persecution of Falun Gong. Also known as Falun Dafa, Falun Gong is a meditation system based on the principles of Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance. Although it was practiced by about 100 million practitioners in over 100 countries, it has been violent suppressed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) since July 1999. Due to pressure from the CCP, however, very few news media have covered this major human rights violation.  Peter Westmore, former president of the National Civic Council (NCC) in Australia, wrote a book review in the August 8, 2020, issue of News Weekly, highly recommending it to libraries as well as government officials.  “For those concerned about the misuse of Chinese power around the world, this book is an essential source of information. It offers over 430 pages of the most exhaustive documentation of the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners in China, and should be in every library and parliamentary office in Australia,” he wrote.  Michael J. Carson from Midwest Book Review (MBR) also recommended the book in April 2020. “Impressively informative, exceptionally well organized and presented,” he wrote, referring to the book as “a unique, extraordinary, and comprehensive study that is especially and unreservedly recommended for personal, community, college, and university library Falun Gong collections and supplemental studies reading lists.”
Wow Joon really saying he loves "the usher line" After that other interview
I came here to watch the interview but ended up by watching whole video in comment section
People change my ass (;´༎ຶٹ༎ຶ`)
Well they announced concert date today ಠ_ಠ
I'm notice that JK's shirts is look likes batik from indonesia, Isn't it ?
Name of the the guy in extreme left??? The silent one
The Anchor's sitting on the left, his voice is amazing!
GOT JOON IN 4K
Lol why they put Namjoon on the spot like that. He is allowed to change his mind.
HOBI IS A MOOD MAKER
1:24  Tae be like : Panda express (thinking) Everyone else: McDonald's Tae:nvm😒😒 😅😅😅😅
Saasy namjoon..ooh i like it😽💜
Namjoon is finally showing he is done with western interviews 🤣🤣 "oh did i?" I love it 🤣🤣🤣
"Only god knows" says Namjoon who is an atheist
Joonie you are an atheist 😭😭😭
1:35 his "did i" 🥺
Omg 🥰🥰
BTS (방탄소년단) Hi ARMY! 'BUTTER' Jimin Cut here: https://youtu.be/vlJt4Z2D6DY   Thank you!
22052021 BTS💜ARMY
Interviewer: Asks about new tour dates.  Namjoon being an *atheist* : Only God knows! 🙏😔
NOT NAMJOON STUTTERING-
*jungkook wearing batik or is it just similar?*
By the way Dynamite got 1 Billion in 7 months and Adele holds the fastest mv to reach 1 Billion which is 87 days.. what do yall say about butter 1B in a month?
1:40 Namjoon's it's not very BaAd is literally my happy pill HAHAHAHAHHAHAH
0:49 Namjoon:only God knows 🥺
I LITTRELY thought jk was V in the thumbnail...  I M SCREAMINGGGGG
Jiminsiiiii is oddly quiet this days, I wish he would cheer up, my mochi
NAMJOON SAYING 'ONLY GOD KNOWS' GOT ME 💀💀 SKSKSKKSSKSSKSKSKSKSKSKKSSK
Junggkook  used  batik  from  Indonesia
I just love how namjoon bought up God's name ♥
Namjoon😍😍😍
Love BTS like 🧈
Did he just call joon "joon"?😳
BTS are so cute I think I’m pregnant
thanks that it's just 3 min i hate long interviews with uncomfortable bangtan
it's "Leader RM" or "Sir Kim Namjoon" for you 🙂 you shouldn't call them by their nicknames...
be not deceived faith without works is dead and Christ says the whole law is to love your neighbor as yourself...
After V's Oreo Mcflurry video gonna viral. Every army go McDonald and order it. I think that's made McDonald to collaborate with bts
Good
That guy calling namjoon ‘joon’ , eyes are twitching....
1:46 I thought hobi said sheeeesh
Although we use ghee, an upgraded form of butter 🔥 but still butter supremacy
"Show our charms and how we are attractive" !?!? U literally had us d worded 😂
Jungkook so handsome
Jin is so cute
“So, Joon, you said you’d never dye your hair pink ever again.”  Joon: **nervous philosophical sputtering**
Notice how they're promoting wayyyyy more in America than in Korea. I wonder how k-army feel about it and bts themselves because obviously they're being forced to do it. Neither of them are from western countries and been raised in Korea. I'm sure they dont care about the US at all and are pretending like they do since they're their company's cash cow.
I see tour dates and I click!  I still have my tickets for the Rose Bowl!
When Namjoon said "Only God knows" omg
THE MALE INTERVIEWER CALLED JOONIE ‘JOON’ & I WAS SO HAPPILY SHOOK ASF JFHDDHFX
Wait, hold up. Did I just hear Joon saying... "Only God knows.".. I thought he's an Atheist??
I thought he called Namjoon “Jone” and i was triggered for him lol
its RM for you 😒
that cute smile taehyung had on his face throughout the interview 💜
interviewer: when'll you announce tour dates? namjoon, very much an atheist: oNlY gOd kNoWs aHaHa  hes trying very hard to fit it :(
Interviewer : When you guys touring in the U.S ,Are there any food that you look for to having when you're here?  BTS : Mc Donalds   V's mind : Panda express Jhope's mind : Hamburger ... And SPRITE!
Any ARMY that hears about the international Tour: BTS come to my country!  Also ARMY: Have no money   Even if we are poor we can sell out all tickets in a minute 👁️👄👁️
No entiendo nada pero let'sgo BTS!!!!!
Yes Butter for Summer
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Man idk but now I'm kinda starting to feel butter in my mouth whenever I see them-
"What the food that you wanna eat when coming to US?" All of Members : McDonald Taehyung and Yoongi 2017 : PaNdA eXpResS WwuUuuu
Jungkook kek pake batik 🤔
Joon you said you'd never dyed your hair pink again why you change it??  Me: YESS!! THAT'S MY QUESTION WHEN I SEE FIRST TIME BUTTER CONSEPT PICTURES I COMMENT THAT WHY HE CHANGED THAT NOW I'M SATISFIED 😂😂😂
Namjoon: Butter let's go Butter:  Dude I am already running  I am so excited for Butter to crash the charts
Woah, finally Yoongi did something more than enough ( I am referring to him speaking)
얘들아 ..... 영어 좀 공부하자......  듣기는 되는거 같은데.....토킹 어바웃에 더욱 정진하자고~~~~ 명색이 레전드 아이돌이잖냐~~~가즈아 화이팅~~!!
Lol these interviews are so easy for them cause they've been asked the same questions haha

"Only God knows" LMAOOO JOONIE YOU'RE ATHEIST

So are we just going to skip the part where joon just yells out hell yeah 🤣🤣
Namjoon sounds like 1:07 father laugh

Rm talking about his change about pink hair got me rolling🤣

I can't imagine how many times jooni said butter for summer

Thank your for this interview~
It's RM, be respectful.
1:19 I know taehyung wanted to say panda express but he must say mcd😭
تاي احبك  بي تي اس احبكم 🇰🇷🇮🇶🔮💜😭🤘
Yoongi is really said : at least I'm present
sugaaaaaaaa 😳
McNugget!!!!!
Looking forward to a new tour soon🙌🏻🤞🏻💛love you boys!
What is the food you look forwards to when you are on tour. btS: We are contractually obliged to say McDonalds, but everyone knows it is Panda Express, Korean food and steak.
Jungkook literally looked like taehyung in the thumbnail
**Butter** Namjoon: "its good for you health believe it or not" In another interview Namjoon: "Its bad for your health tho" ...umm... I guess  People ChAnGe 😂😂
WHY DID THE INTERVIEWER CALL OUT NAMJOON LIKE THAT 💀💀
Stream butter
The amount of people talking about God and mentioning how RM’s an atheist appalls me. Can’t we just enjoy the talk show? Smh.
"Is there any food that you guys are looking forward to try when you come here" "Mc Donalds"     Why did I expect Tae to say "PANDA EXPRESS"
I dunno why but I found it adorable when Joon said  "ASAP"
Namjoon just started answering before the questions like "Yeah so we released butter and the inspiration and...." He is so done TwT
RM: It's good for your health, believe it or not.  Well, he ain't wrong.. Those who have done Keto know what I'm talkin' about LOL
*Please Stream Butter!!!*
Wait I thought butter was bad for your health 😭😭
*namjoon an atheist *  Also namjoon: only god knows...
Okay but the energy namjoon is giving off is *chef kisses*
i live for namjoon's "HELL YEAH".
BTS's inspiration is BTS. yes i 100% agree.
Did he said John ??? @ 1:23  No he didn’t is Joon and with respect RM
you.... really had to ask about releasing tour dates???????? get out man
“Oh did I?” Namjoon knows how he caught us all off guard with the pink 💀💀
Other members: I better stay quite Namjoon: *shining through the city with the little funk and soul*
DID YOU JUST CALL HIM JOON??????
"Only God knows..." "HELL YEA HELL YEA" "Its good for your health believe it or not" Plz Namjoon is so comfortable in this (maybes bc he's tired lmao) I love it
NAMJOON'S HELL YEAH 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I thought Namjoon was an atheist but then he goes and says some shit like “only God knows”. 😭😭😭   This is a joke don't take this to seriously
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZU1tLVmSXZU&t=2s

BTS
He really caught joon at 4K 💀💀
Smooth like butter~~~~~~
HELL YEAHHH
Re tour dates RM: Only God knows! 🤣
Jungkook is a purple boba ball
namjoon aren’t you an atheist
👀 so Joon???????
Joon is being really respectful to the interviewers by saying their names at the end.
Why have all these random ppl started calling them by their nicknames? It just makes me cringe.The  'Joon' almost sounded like  'John'.   I'm not hating on the interviewer though, he probably picked it up from the thousands of army comments on their posts
V and Suga: Is it over yet? 😀
BUTTERRR
RM such a play boy  People have to change their mind  Best explanation for pink hair
Omg 💚💚💚🤩🤩love bts
World Domination BTS BUTTER

Wow they have the same favourite lyrics impossible

Them saying they look forward to having McDonald’s in America like McDonald’s isn’t also in South Korea lol.
BTS look sooooo pretty 😍 amazing interview
Ahh joon really stuttered when asked about pink hair! Aww He really is the love of my life!!
Jungkook wearing batik?
Itu Jungkook pakai batik ya
BEAUTIFUL JIMIN
💜
One thing I think is so cool about BTS is that they have absolutely no shame doing product endorsements.  A lot of groups would be slammed and called sell outs for doing so.  I think people tend to forget that while they do have a love for creating music, it's also their job and I'm sure they want to get paid.  I'm surprised they didn't get some type of butter endorsement.  Not going to lie, but I'm curious what each of their net worth is.
Army go to st3em Butter
0:49 His laugh... HIS LAUGH !! 😭💕
Yes! We got bunch of interviews which is the hardest thing to find and watch it all compared to beating our own records (from Dynamite) lmao.
thank u so much guys for this
👤 So about Butter--  BTS: *talks about foods with butter*
pongan subs en español, no soy bilingüe
I just want to wrap Yoongi in a mandu wrap
“So Joon, u said that u would never dye your hair pink ever again, WHY’D U CHANGE YOUR MIND??”  HE SAYS IT SO AGGRESSIVELY LMAOOO
Very important, said J hope😂
I asked the same question about Namjoon hair 🤣
Watched so many interviews I know RM’s going to say BUTTER FOR SUMMER 🥞☺️
Namjoon looks HELLA cute with pink hairs, I freaked out when I saw him in pink hair color. I'm grateful he changed his mind hehe love him so much
Caught RapMon slipping xD Him scratching his head reminds me of the little chunky kid in glasses meme
So many interviews in a single day.....
https://youtu.be/WMweEpGlu_U here is butter stream
Joon's voice broke a bit when he was asked about his pink hair and HAD ME CRYING

BTS are just so genuine with great music and personalities to boot, how can you not like them?!
هاي الاغنيه تخبببببل
BTS mc Donald’s menu not available here I’m sad especially when nuggets are the only things I like to buy Sad Dynamite could make us all smile through an horrible year and Butter is a lot of fun
Taehyung is so cute 💜
Extrañaba mucho ver a Yoongi en las entrevistas 🥺💜
I need the cardigan suga is wearing
NAMJOOOON
Me who thinks of blue band whenever the word butter comes up
버터는 못 참는 포도알 정구기 :-)
I want BTS meal at McDonalds!! 💜😂
Namjoon being the savage king that he is , I'm living for it
So cute
Suga looked like an old grandpa when he spoke omg immaa cry now😭😭
Giggly namjoon is just cryyyy
Interviewer: Do you use a lot of butter in your cooking at home?  Namjoon: HELL YEAH, HELL YEAH
Alguien ke me diga que decían:'v
And then there’s Germany... we won’t have the BTS Meal here...  my country is a disappointment 😪
오빠들 때문에 세계평화 가능하겠다 모든 나라에 방탄소년단 팬들 다 있을 듯해요ㅎㅎ
_I love you_
Who's joon? Haha
Namjoon is killing me in these interviews, he looks so good, I'm drooling!!! 😫😫😫😫😫
my concert tickets are collecting dust rn
Jimin are you ok my love?
Jimin i love you so much and i loved your hair in butter my prince
We jus gon ignore namjoon yelling “hell yea”???😭
0:36 Jimin is a baby of few words
I can't believe there was a question about food in the US. How does this moment relate to the US?! Does the interviewer know anything about the variety of food in Korea?  At which point will American interviewers start learning about BTS and stop talking about themselves? Because we are def not interested in them, but in BTS.
I wish they would've spaced the interviews throughout the week instead of 1 day. You can tell they're tired of answering the same questions
HE CALLED NAMJOON JOON
namjoon in interviews hits differently
Not them turning against Panda Express😂
namjoon, an atheist: *only god knows aHa*
Jungkook pake batik membuat serasa mampu utk digapai wkwkwk...
Lol one thing I noticed is all female interviewer always say " love that" is that an American thing?
the fact the I see Namjoon's name everywhere in this comment section HAHA love to see that 😍😍😍💜
butter sooty
When namjoon said it's good for your health, although he said it's bad for your diet in the other interview. MA BOY decide 😂
Jungkook kill me already sweetie
The way namjoon eyes widen when he said “ he wasn’t ever going to dye his hair pink”
Thank you Namjoon for going pink again. Truly a blessing
I love BTS so much 💜💜
Lmaooo Panda Express must feel betrayed since McDonalds got a collab first and now the boys are saying its their fave to eat in the States
NAMJOONS VOICE CRACK AT 1:40  I CANT-
Joonie's *DID I?* made me squeal I don't why he's looking so cute and happy. And I'm lovin' it
‘It’s not very bad to change, I’ve changed yes’ You can love your current self and still change and grow to be who you want to become
حض ارمي اجانب ⬆️⬆️ حض ارمي العرب ⬇️⬇️
I don't know how he have the audacity to call Namjoon "joon" he not your close friend so why and then his closed friends call him with the "hyung" if fill like this😬😐

Thanks for the interview. Butter is a great song. Makes me happy.
Interviewer : "Joon"  me : *triggered*
Damn Jungkook is looking so handsome
Is it that hard to speak for Palestine?Is it that hard to speak for human rights?from the moment it started..from the second children are being killed,women are being tortured,doctors are being burnt....I was waiting for you guys to say a one word..I was waiting and believing that no matter what if some one else say anything or not but THEY are the one who will come forward and speak for the GOOD,and guess what not a SINGLE WORD....  Is it Too much from my side...from me as an ARMY..or from the whole BTS Muslim fandom to expect from our mentors,motivators to speak for human-rights....and if i am saying this that doesn't mean that i am hating them NO!NOT AT ALL.... i am saying this because RM himself told us to speak to him...he himself said that he will listen to us..he told us that he will help us to express our emotions...because expectations are made only to those to whom we love or to whom who told us how to be loved by someone..BECAUSE I AM NOT ASKING TO HAVE SIDES ,TO CHOOSE BETWEEN PALESTINE AND ISRAEL,TO SAY WHO IS RIGHT OR WHO IS WRONG, NOT EVEN ASKING FOR ANY DONATIONS....THE ONLY THING I AM SAYING IS TO CONDEMN ALL THE INNOCENT KILLINGS..BECAUSE IT MATTERS A LOT @/rm @/v @/suga @/jin @/jimin @/jhope @/jungkook @/btsarmy @/freepalestine @/israelbreaksthetruce
Jungkook is looking so hella fine
namjoon in this interview: butter is good for your health believe it or not  namjoon in a different interview: it’s bad for your diet though
Jungkook's look on fire
I was like where is Jungkook!  Then boom I saw him 😲 he is looking so handsome with this hairstyle
Only God knows Says Namjoon, the atheist.
The guy I feel like,his  daughter gave him the questions he should ask!!😂😂😂
Jungkook :YOU CAN'T SAY NO TO BUTTER
MC menu does not come to Turkey. no dear, it's not upsetting, I just had a heart attack when I heard that.
I need to get my eyesight checked because when I saw the thumbnail I was convinced JK was Taehyung. I literally saw 2 Taehyungs. Whaaaat-
في ارمي عرب 💜💜
"It's good for your health" "It's bad for your diet" Namjoon?!?!
I love the outro lines too. Stronger BTS
Well jungkook now looks good with his short purple hair. Well I prefered him with long hair but as I see now it looks cool. He looks like a 18 years old boy. Nice I like it
Asking about tour dates now? Really??
Joonie giving excuses smoothly like a BUTTER But still we love his pink hair though

I can see it now, Butter is part of a trilogy of Songs, B   next song starts with T and last song S. Maybe food related. Or maybe classic sayings, since there is the saying "smooth like Butter"

The inspiration is BTS themselves writing a cool song for summer and trying to show their charms and how they are attractive individually and as a team...even though we already know this lol thanks to them for this great song and great shots of them!  Also thanks to Namjoon for his pink hair again lol and congrats to all the boys and also the whole bighit team!

The way Namjoon was talking about him changing his mind 😂 it's okay haha I loved the pink hair on him, he suits everything 🥰
Oh god I forgot it’s going to be a summer of inane/repetitive questions for the boys 😫 The food question again, I can’t.  (Props to the pink hair question though, that takes paying a little attention)
Namjoon explaining why he dyed his hair pink when he said he won't.😆😆😍💜Just how cute that was.
butter for summer
namjoon´s hair is like chocovanilla ice cream C:
person: "do you cook with butter?' joon: "HELL YEAAAAAAHH"
Hobi: McNugget! 😭
the interviewer called him joon 😭 we got an ARMY over here
"So we are going to keep the hope and do our best job"🥺🥺 -Jung Hoseok 2021
*"So joon You Said That You Never Gonna Dye Your Hair Pink Ever Again ?"* *Namjoon Be Like : " I Did It ? !!!"*  *And The Reaction Of J-Hope Is Precious*
Jhope knows that song 😭😭😭😂😂😂

#butterforsummer
TO THOSE ARMYS WHO DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO STREAM BUTTER HERE IS MY HELP PLSS SHARE THIS 🙏 💜   COPY PASTE AND COMMENT ON EVRY BTS VIDEO My dear ARMY friends it's time to freak YouTube out. They took almost 15million views away. Let's all take a strict action against YouTube and stream hard. And one more request don't report to bots just ignore them. Streaming rules 1. Volume should be above 50% 2. Don't speed up the MV. 3. Don't replay, pause or skip the mv 4. Search the mv manually on YouTube eg. 5. Don't ever skip ads(if they're like 15-30 minutes then skip it after 30 seconds but don't skip it if they're small. 6. Watch the mv in 480 p or more. 7. Turn on the subtitle. 8. Like the mv after 30 seconds 9. Don't use playlist cause either your view will get deleted or no matter how many times u have the song in the playlist. It will be counted as 1 view (it is confirmed by YouTube) 10. Don't use emoji and don't report hate comments. 11. Don't watch the lyrics videos cause the mv already has English subtitles. 12. Don't watch reaction videos within the next 24 hours. 13. Don't delete or pause your YouTube history. 14. Don't engage with haters, leave a nice comment and enjoy the comeback. 15. Don't sleep until it breaks Dynamite records. Fighting(fist emoji)
Joon: "only God knows" Joon: *atheist*

Namjoon : people changes , everything changes Me after watching butter : well said....oh my jk and hoseok 💜✨
"when it feels safe we'll hop on tour ASAP. literally ASAP." i really can't wait for that day to come 🥺💜
They must be tired,   I mean a lot of interviews and all,,,,  They feel good and great for their new hit   ,,,,   BUTTER.  Now  please,  Please let them relax.  AFTER ALL THEY R HUMANS   !!
Interviewer: Joon Army: What!! No. Know your place.

2:15 when they asked if they use butter in their cooking and j-hope went  “berry important” in tiny plz that’s so cute bzbzb
"only god knows"...you're literally atheist
RM LITERALLY SAID BUTTER IS BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH IN ANOTHER INTERVIEW. HE CAN'T MAKE UP HIS MIND 😂😂😂
HAHAHHA joon getting flustered after the pink hair question and his voice crack HES SO CUTE
WE CAUGHT YOU IN 4K JOON,but we will let it slide🤣
Peolple change u know namjoon
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The usher line is my fav too
Yoongi looks so tired. And I think the reason why he's tired is because he probably stayed up late doing work because we all know Yoonie doesn't sleep (He writes lyrics 12-6 am). And he keeps moving his arm a little I think he can't sit comfortably because of his arm (he's doing shock therapy). And he's trying to keep his back straight (by sitting up and not hunching).
I just love them
Nam your hair looks amazing I want to do the same with my
namjoon saying "maybe only god knows" is just- 😭
Joon✨💜
BTS standout from the rest which make them unique.
Interviewer: so joon.... Me : what joon!! Are you an army?? If not stay in your lane😭😭 M so jealous he gets to call him joon.
BUTTER FOR SUMMER
Namjoon : People change  Me : yeah, I know Joonie I Know
