What an awesome win. Those descents on the gravel were so game.
Pinarello Dogma F 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
in recent years it has proven itself as good or better than some of the longer in the tooth monuments.
Just how good is Tom ? His tour stage last year ? This ride ? His climbing and descending is outstanding. He’s hard to catch once he’s out front. What ever the discipline. Well done young Tom !
🇬🇧!
Wow , just wow !
One of the most iconic solo perfomances in one day monument history,an inspiring display from a possesed rider,the future of UCI is safe,Matt Pid
I've seen bikes racing through the town as part of the movie based in Chillingbourne. 🚲🚲🚲🚲
Do all the pros use tubeless tires now?
That's how you win these classic races. 50km to go, just launch it. No one will try to close the gap, drafting others. Giving you more gap time, hence the win. 5 years before people have won that way.
very impressive win and an excellent highlight package. Piddocks Descends like a madman!
Tom Pidcock you legend. Will be the most successful British cyclist of all-time.
Can little Tom Pidcock conquer the cobbles?
This race would be awesome if they raced under L'Eroica rules.
Too bad they're all on the juice
well frellin done Tom...well done indeed, I did wonder with such an early break without another rider to share the load with... fantastic win & certainly one to remember.
Marvellous escaped run away victory for Thomas Pitkcock, followed by Valentin Madouas in this 2023 Stade Bianche, on a very tricky sandy and dusty race! 💙💟❤🍀🗽🥇🦺☯🏳‍🌈!
Brilliant ride Tom well done.
SAFA Tom
What a race! Greetings to MVP - Heads up  bud, your day will come also :) Congrats for Thomas Pidcock who won the race on his own! 👋
Fantastic ride by Pidcock, well earned victory. I think he might've bribed Valther though, what was he doing?!
Parabéns Pidcock 👏 Excelente Rui Costa 💪👏👏👏 Estás em grande forma 💪👏👏👏 Abraço desde Aveiro 🇵🇹
Unbelievable win, unbelievable. Some comments on here implying that the infighting between the chasers helped, which is perhaps one way of looking at it. The other is that Pidcock’s unexpected break and ultimate strength put pressure on the chasers to ultimately break their resolve to catch him and accept the left overs. Glass half full, rather than half empty. Great job young man. 🥇
Congrats Tom, worthy winner!
Great commentating and editing. Particularly compared to the recent UAE tour highlight videos, which was kind of a mumbling mess that didn't tell you what was happening in the race and left you rewinding to try to understand the relevant bits.
Pidcock had courage, the best legs, superb descending skills on gravel ...and luck that everyone in the chase group (especially the two TJV riders) were acting like prima donna's.
Nice to see Ineos continuing with team skys super juice 💉
Wow what a race!
Poor Wout van Aert on Teide, 90% of form would have been enough to win easily.
Happy to see the mountain biker win on gravel but the chase group was a pain to watch. No cooperation at all. Reminded me of the women‘s worlds last year. I would have asked Costa how he managed to get the rainbow bands with such a hard desire not to win or looked for some cooperation to bounce him off the group.
The guy is also a Tour de France stage winner in Alp D’huez non the less by the way
Dommage pas de lecture en français
Not the best chemistry in the group chasing. Especially between team mates Benoot and Valter. 7 seconds!! That's easily closed with a group working smoothly together.
I watched the whole video all the way through, and I'm not sure how well the cyclists can breathe when dust is sent flying up into the air by various types of motorized vehicles and other cyclists.
Dan, you are practically an Italian native speaker!
Absolutely spectacular! A well, well deserved win for Pidcock!
Unbelievable. I cycled 60 km on those "roads" last summer, and I can't fathom how these guys are racing that far, that fast. Superhuman.
To Aussie eyes, used to the dry brown land of Oz, these verdant gently rolling hills really are so very beautiful! 😍 But, I'd love to know HOW it is that all the riders don't get punctures every couple of km on that rough gravel? 🤔  How tough are their tyres? Mr Pidcock has really only just begun his career.  How good could he become?  Superb here. 😄👍 M 🦘🏏😎
If i remember correctly. This little man can go toe to toe sprint with Van aert lol. Didnt know this guy has something
MVdP was so marked that they forgot the other champion. Congratulations, Tom Pidcock.
Pidcock, that was a testament to his toughness.
Excellent effort. Deserves the win and maybe a new bike :))))
Holy pidcock 🤯
Piddy !
Bravo Tommy!
Pidcock is a beast
Another example of someone on the juice
Finally...the gravel world championships!!!👍🤣
Great watching this race today!! Is Dan doing the recap because he came 9th that one time 🤔😁
PIDCOCK HAS SHOWED TWICE THAT DESCENDS WINS RACES
PIDCOCK IS A MONSTER
Great ride 🎉🎉
The wee man is an incredible all rounder for one so small. Guys with Tom's build used to be pure climbers but his descending, decent sprint etc are very impressive. Hoping he can net a Monument this season.
The expression of exhaustion on Pidcock’s face & in his body. That man can really put it all down!
A brave & glorious ride. Well done champ.
How he was able to increase the gap again from that 7sec is out of this world
Chapeau Tom Pidcock.. outstanding riding and ability. ,🇬🇧 👏👏👏
YES PIDCOCK!!!! ❤🇬🇧
Yes Tom!!!!! Yorkshire’s finest. 💪🏻
Pidcock the current King of bike handling! It's always good when bike handling pays off.... Congrats!
Beast
Insane not to show more of pidcocks descent footage skidding all over the gravel in the highlights or the moment Benoot got caught by his team mate.. Just odd to me, two of the best parts of the race’
Was Pidcocks rear tire flat on the last climb?  looked so at the end if so extra well-done on that effort.
Just an incredible ride by young Tom. I was shouting at the TV. Absolute legend.
Got to STOP giving away the winner in the thumbnail EVERY time, its so ridiculous!
@nerocoaching Do you still think Pidcock is under performing??!! maybe he watches the show and your doubt inspired him
What an absolute beast!
Why almost no coverage in British press ???
Love this result!!
Attila Valter gifted it to Pidcock
Wow!!  On the group ride this morning we were discussing TP's downhill talents.  Amazing.
Oh God 🤦🏻🤦🏻 Another season of this terrible voice over guy. Ffs get a professional
Well, seems like his decision to end his cyclocross season a little early and focus on the road has already paid off. What an an amazing win!
That Brit is as bold as they come.
New drug program for the no show at Cross world's Rider...joke
Great recap of an exciting race, thanks GCN!
Awesome... we'll done to pidcock and his team..  miss cx worlds and win strata..   he really knows how to target the right races and win
Class act.
Not a Pidcock fan but that was a phenomenonal ride by him.
What a great victory. Motivation and self belief. Hats off for Pidcock
Indeos wins?! Wow. Ineos wins zip. My mistake. I had thought mvp easily beats pidcock. Mvp non-existent today.  Way to go pidcock. You educate me
Congratulations, Pidcock!
Utter dude! What a rider!
Pidcock FTW, seem like when its his days he commit and go for it. Cant wait to watch him at Le tour the France later this years. Last years crazy descent + win on Huez was epic.
Nice one Tom lad 🇬🇧👍
A Lot of elite cyclists who have won a monument have tried and failed to win this race. It’s just as significant as a monument. Unnecessary comment 🤷‍♂️
Oh yeah baby, what an effort!!!!!!
Super Tom Pidcock
"No Brit had ever won the mens edition of Strada Bianche before today. Pidcock and Daniel Lloyd are the only ones to ever finish in a single digit position in this race." Fixed that for you :)
Safa tuned him up
Good job presenting by Dan !
Pidcock and descents = iconic duo.
Commanding performance!
So happy to see young Tom take this monument. I know the roads well and the gravel can be horrendous. Toms bike handling skills are very well suited to this terrain. Well done and what a great start to your season proper.
Jumbo kind of blew their race imo
What a talent to win like that 🙂
Monster ride by pidcock
Loved the lenght of the vid.
That was the face of a man who went to war with himself. What a beautiful victory.
Must have been freezing the first 2 hours, and funny no ones using a gravel
Mountain biker descends to victory.
Great win for Pidcock. Well deserved!
Amazing ride
Nice race, but not a monument.
Amazing race by Pidcock, even he admitted that it wasn’t exactly his plan to do that yet he reaps the benefits of quick thinking and 100% commitment to his move. Congratulations Tommy! Love seeing this guy win because he always keeps it real🎉
That dude has skills.
the jumbo visma teamwork in the chasing group was horrendous they could have played this so much better, great win for pidcock tho, he really deserved it
Congratulations to Tom Pidcock!!!
Go Yorkshire lad...you legend..!!
Bloody brilliant! Amazing Tom!
Feel the review of British top finishers short of top 9 was overly truncated.
WOW !!!!
I'll give credit where it is due..... I've given Pidcock fans a lot of grief for them comparing him to WVA and MDVP in cyclocross, so now I'll say, that was a great race by Mr. Pidcock and a great win. Enjoy it guys.
pretty lousy teamwork by Jumbo...
Thanks again for the content
poor co-operation from the group, but lets be honest, at least 5 or 6 riders from the group tried on multiple occasions to close down Pidcock and couldnt quite get there, while their lack of co-operation certainly helped, winning from 50km out doesnt just 'happen'...it was a phenomenal ride!
Please don't give race ending away with title!
🔥 I love seeing Pidcock win races. Seems like such a humble kid.
Wow! Amazing stuff, 50km on his own
Pidcock is great for one-day race in all disciplines. He has yet to transform himself for 3-weeks Grand Tour race. When he does, we'll see royale battle among youngsters under 25 in the grand tours.
When you commit to the move a long way out and hold them off...  Must be a great feeling.
For some reason I thought this was on tomorrow 🤦‍♂️
Now that there’s a British winner can we stop hearing about Llloydy’s 9th place?
Such a poor cooperation from chasing group and in the end in my opinion - missed opportuinity by them. Anyways, hats off to Pidcock, spectacular ride!
Edge of the seat stuff!
Uhullllll
