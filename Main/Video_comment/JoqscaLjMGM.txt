Welcome to Middlesbrough Micah Hamilton
THAT DIVE BY HAMILTON IS ABSURD
Solidna utakmica Zvezde, šteta nije bilo dovoljno.
City deffo building some promising future stars that's for sure! Great to see the young lads getting a chance to showcase their games!
Wait a sec..... Kalvin actually played?????..... Should have stayed at leeds.... Would have played every week... Not every 2 years... Alaw.... Mot
115 breaches?
"he scored rather well there actually" erm yeah? Phillips is brilliant. Might not get in to the first team for the current european champions, most people don't, doesn't mean he can't bury a penalty. Hope KP goes elsewhere and reminds people how good he is.
Great to see young men playing with such composure. Well done lads.
5:35 Commentator forgot what country the team plays in😂
That was a dive for the third
Not a penalty a young diver in the making plenty more diving in the future.
Man Utd needs to borrow this city B Team 😅😅
All the comms staff at TNT can now lump in with Arsenal now the rags and barcodes are out.
This this was good game
They let less goals in this match than they did with a full squad
{ 💙 MCFC 💙 }  Every young player was great from starting the game to coming on in the 2nd half they were just as good as any player  in the first team of the premiership 👌
Oscar Bob SILKY Dribller
Not bad for the reserve team
MUPPETS     PRICKS ........  WHAT    MEAN     "RED STAR "   ??????
Two new top talents for City to sell to fund Pep buying more ready made talents. Hamilton's dive was horrific.
Oscar Bobb has to be the best name ever. Sounds like a WW1 English hero.
hwang looks very good icl
Why was that first clip included lmao
Can't believe how excited Robbie Savage was for Hamilton scoring. Flattest commentary I've ever heard.
Wang was outstanding hope he gets picked up by a big club
It wasn't a penalty he touched the ball. Don't understand that
Will be good to have them both in the lower league when 115 charges fc get relegated a few divisions 🎣
Look forward to Bobb and Hamilton playing for other teams when city get relegated through the divisions 😂
Well Hamilton knows how to dive lol 😂
Our boy mohamadou susoho made it on the big stage alhamdulillah straight out of bd3 honestly can’t express how happy I am for him. Playing with him when he first came to England at BD3 United to now seeing him make it to the big stage alhamdulillah keep it up
Gutting to see City producing another amazing talent 💩
A Man City RB called Micah bursting on the scene.....where have we heard that before?
Can’t wait till Phillips leaves City he is not good enough for us
Bobb and Hamilton showing Grealish how its done  they are superstars, what an amazing job the Man City academy does
4:39 is such an hilarious dive and the officials fell for it
That academy of theirs is starting to stick out hell they have some quality players coming through scary...
wasn’t even a penalty he clearly dived
RB dribble that by Man City hahaha 👀🤣🤣🤣
What a game
It’s Belgrade. Calm down.
4:00:00
8:48
The swan dive for the penalty was embarrassing. 🤣🤣🤣
115 another irrelevant void result for the cheats
What a player Hamilton is
signed hamilton on fm go on my son !
Pep has found his right winger in Hamilton.
Always special when one of your own scores their first goal for the club
City have such an underrated academy with the likes of Foden, Palmer and now Hamilton coming through
Na that dive is shameful
Bobb has ball control like Messi
Bobb and Hamilton 👏
Phillips should have stayed at Leeds…. Greed got to him in my opinion and it’s back fired… ain’t always gotta join the best to be the best….
Bobb and Hamilton could be deadly with Lewis in the mix for City later on in the PL and CL campaign 😱
Now UEFA has to make so many gold medals for the city players at the end of the season because of this game 😂
manchester city, a historically irrelevant club, now has enough money to have a youth reserve team that can win away in the champions league against a historically great club, football is finished
Micah Richards = Meek a Micah Hamilton = Mic a  Which one os the correct pronunciation
Honestly these city boys make rashford, Antony and Sancho look absolute garbage
Struggling against wifi passwords 😂😂😂
Who dis Hamilton? He looks class.
This City team would beat or give most PL teams a run for their money…shows how impressive their academy is
When did Kal become a pen taker?
another Hwang banging here <3
4:40
I don’t even know this city team
Red star had bad luck ...2 times in the crossbar ..
Phillips took the pen 😭 get this guy out my club asap man 😂
Undeniably the best team and squad in world football as well as the poster team for state sponsored financial doping- should be banned from the competition
Robbie savage is truly the worst commentator of all time
Mikel Arteta would never blood  young players like this 💩
well done to city young scorers - but I hate how a young team can win against a power house.  The gap is just getting too big.  Teams like Celtic, Red Star, FCSB, Benfica etc have no chance due to budgets
they’re treating phillips like one of the youngsters giving him the pen 😂
I'm Hajduk fan, but Zvezda playing good tonight. Manchester have talented team but no amount 💰💰 can buy this atmosphere 🔥 bravo delije -poz iz Splita
Well wen the 115 charges are heard u will need these players
So happy for kalvin Phillips tonight. I hope he stays with us cos he has potential but it looks unlikely
Hamilton a new star❤❤❤
Wish Arsenal would have done this against PSV.
wait a minute!!! did I just see kalvin Phillips on the field while a game was been played. his he ment to be there?
Why the hell did Savage bother flying out there? Garbage commentating.
Another former ball boy turned first team player. Madness
Happy for Phillips
The number of crazy talented English youngsters is incredible, more and more just keep coming through
Man City defence is shocking of late! They will get caught out further down these comps!
good on pep giving the youth a chance to shine
This might be controversial but I’d put money on Oscar bob winning a ballon dor before he retires. What a talent 🔥
I rate city
What a stark difference between Robbie Savage commentary on a city game  vs his commentary on man utd games lol
what a surprise once again they scrape a Wind by one goal and they go into the Champions League all the games that they have played have just been a one game sprint they've only one by one 1 not much of if they can only scrape one goal every game there's no way this surviving in a round of 16
good luck to whoever face city next in the league lol  The main squad are now fully rested. YIKES
Dortmund draw psg
Anyone wondering why Philips doesn't get in the team just watch him during red star's first goal.
Even these City squads can beat United.
🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵
Oscar Bob. I love that name
Oscar Bob. I love that name
Hopefully this will give Kalvin Phillips some much needed momentum.
Unbelievable unbeatable come on city 👏 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Man city D team winning champions league away games
5 cracking goals and City on fire.
Bursting on to the scene like another famous Micah
Manchester City has a lot of great young black players, great to see, we’re taking over!!!
Man Utd starting 11 would have found a way to lose this game 3-1 to Red Star and Ten Hag's tactical solution would be to make them do long-distance running all week 😂
Seeing Kevin took the penalty and scored, gave me a nonchalant Vibe, and boosted his confidence of believing in himself
Allow Man City fans getting hyped about a 20 year old that will be playing in the championship next year.
Bobb's yer uncle.
Hamilton has always been good, i played with him a few times
Grealish might be all time over rated player
I won't be surprised if city watses his talent by selling him since the team is packed with stars and the only academy star with regular game time being Phil Foden
props to city for playing their youngsters and giving them time to shine in such a great competition, doing what arsenal didn't.
Go on citeh
Very rarely seen city in third kit this season but tonight whilst the kit is 🔥 some of the players wearing it like Bobb & Hamilton set pitch alight
Hamilton is brilliant at this rate he is the new Riyad mahrez. Such good players both of them
If bobb & Hamilton follow the footsteps of foden & Rico Lewis tonight won’t be the last we see if the duo - superb performance/debut/first goal
This man city c team is better than our Chelsea main team. Honestly shows the levels, embarrassing as a Chels fan
Chelsea is recognised to have the best academy and that's official ⚽
Has Robbie been smoking something?
Hamilton looks quality
That goal from Bobb was peak Messi.
Arteta made a big mistake not giving the youngsters a chance to shine idc.
Oscar bobb baby
I just hope Pep watches the full match back but just concentrates on Phillips. He’s a Championship player at best…. woeful reading of game, of ball control or tackling or passing. Move him on and recoup £5million… the balance will just have to written off to experience. There’s a reason he hardly ever plays, he is not anywhere near the standard required but that applies to several of this current squad.
Everyone talking about all the city backup players and no one talking about kalvin phillips first goal for city
people who think the star boy be the best goal scorer⬇
Good to see Kalvin getting a game. What a waste of a great talent
better than a united 1st team
City joins Liverpool in being the second English team to win all their champions league group stage matches.
This is exactly what Arsenal should have done put the wonderkids out 😢
what a star boy for manchester city absulate perfection😃🤩🤩
City showing United how to play football
What great young prospects city have. And how important to have someone like foden to look up to aswell.
WOW hamilton  IS LIKE YOUNG MBAPPE
Man City's b team can easily beat Man Utd first team
Ortega is such a good keeper his composure and passing accuracy is sick.
Michael Hamilton looks like mbappe
Manchester City have the best academy in England 💙  Talented players like Palmer, Foden, Sancho, Lavia, Bobb, Nmecha, Frimpong & Lewis.
from ball boy to star boy what a player hamilton is!!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️
Oscar bobb looks generational
First
First
First for once
💙💙💙
First
Kalvin is the GOAT
Micah Hamilton is Lewis Hamilton of football….
This city team could still beat united
