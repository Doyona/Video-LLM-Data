Old bills don't have the strip
Does the meat you serve is halal because I am thinking of trying them
Idk the laws in the US but in my country Milad would have committed a crime here by returning the bill to the guy instead of calling the popo
Not all 100 dollar bills have a strip I got a couple from my bank that doesn’t
has anyone ever tried to fight you or say il fight you
The sad thing is that maybe someone scammed him with it before and he genuinely thought it was real lol

Happy birthday
if someone tries to pay with counterfeit money, make him a scamwich. that'll be a sandwich with fake cheese and face ham, with fake sauce and bread.
When I worked at Subway, we never would accept $100 bills unless it was for a catering order.

I once printed a 10p doler bill with the white strip it worked so i stoped
I remember one time when I had just started at a cashier job years back... I had a guy come in and try to do the "Can you change this for me?" scam, where they give you a large note and ask you to break it into smaller notes (in this case, a 50 into two 20s and a 10), and then keep changing their mind to try and get you to mistakenly give them more money than they pretended to give you, switching back and forth, to confuse the cashier, etc. After a couple of these flitters back and forth, I ended up just handing him the correct amount of smaller notes (after checking the larger note was real, of course). My manager was beside me at the time, and congratulated me on not falling for it... I'm still unsure if it was a test she set up or was actually someone trying to scam us.
The strip can actually be removed fairly easily, that's why there are multiple anti-counterfeiting devices in the bills.
Cool story bro....
Love your videos!! They're amazing. Stay safe out there everyone ❤️🌻🍒
Who's brings a $100 to subway
😪😪😪🙏🙏😪🙏🙏🙏You have two hands.  One to help oneself and the other to help others.   10.  Helping others is the fare of being in your world.  So don’t be arrogant about it.   11.  Helping someone may not change the world, but it can change that person.   12.  Today I found that if you want to love someone, you have to bring out the best version of him by helping him and not by changing him.
Worked for 6 years at a subway and at one time my boss got a€ 50 false bill. He did not trust it and checked it in the light and the machine that is there for and discovered it was false. The men was already out of the store and my boss called him back. The men got angry and all. They argue a moment but at some point the men called the police . Because he taught my boss tried to scam him. The police came (the same that came every week for a sub) and checked the camera (the men said my boss had switched the bills) the saw he did not and the men had to pay his sub with his debit card and the police took the false bill.  So the men did not only had to pay for his sub but lost his €50 bill and got a official warning for money fraud.  So people don't call the police if you try to pay with a  false bill🤣
Do ppl not realize that old bills don't have water marks or security strips. Also, because of the years of circulation, the old bills feel fake asf! They feel smoother then new bills. ALWAYS scratch the coat of the president on the bill.. If it's real, you'll feel ridges! And don't use the pin, now a days counterfeit bills pass.
You can get up to 20 yours for that I think
"You can't scam meh..." 😂
The deal is free cookies not free sandwiches
You are Iranian not are you Muslim?? Is that okey to work with Pork, Ham for you??
it might've just been REALLY OLD money...  I mean, wHo gets maD for not bEiNg able to sCam sOmEone
The store I worked at didn't accept $100s unless it was more than like $70 of sandwiches and we had the change for it. Never took one with checking it with a marker
Luv your content mountain dew plz pin this
The guy probably got mad because he had no idea it was fake.
Why is this trending and why did I watch it?
“you can’t scam meh” - milad mirg
*Hey, to you reading* .. you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Milad you might have f’d up on that one cuz there are still multiple $100 bills in circulation that don’t have the blue strip. They’re older Versions but they’re still valid I own 2 myself
Hi
There also are testers for the money-
It was probably a good $100 bill, dating 2013 or earlier but you think you know everything.
There's not always a strip that's the new bills fuu
dude i cant watch ur vids anymore without imagining jumanneway
You actually can call the police on someone who gives you fake money
Not every real $100 bill has that strip , most of the old bills have been fazed out but there is still some of the old ones still in circulation
He probably gave you an old $100 bill
The 2009 100 bills didn’t have the blue line, yikes 😳
Fake scripted
I seriously thought I was going to see the $100 bill or something in this video but I just got the story........cooooooooool
Old $100 bills don’t have the strip on them you goon. That’s why they make those pens to test bills out. Bills pre-1990 didn’t have a security strip at all.   Imagine thinking you screwed over a scammer when you probably just looked like a moron zoomer because you think the world was created when you were born.
Yessir 2 spicy Italians
Who wants to listen to these trivial banalities?  Our society is fucking intolerable.
He may probably had a old 100 dollar bill they don’t have the strips
Nah theres still bill's in circulation that dont have the strip on them, my bank gave me a few of them and it got the cops called on at a Taco Bell 🙃
It doesn’t always need the strip put it in the automatic safe in the back and it’ll verify it cause old money looks NOTHING like new ones
Wow i never knew you were a McDonald employee
this is trending not Italy or Switzerland protests or lets go brandon
If someone tries to pay with a hundred dollar/pound bill it's 99% a scam like who pays for a £3 sandwich with a £100
The idi@t paid a sandwich with an 100.dollar bill

Ya this didnt happen.
There's $100 bills without the strip?

Why was someone trying to pay for a $10 sandwich with a $100 bill
Jesus died for your sins
Did someone karen mode you?
Me: watches the vid Milad: you can't scam meh
Why do you work in your parents store
I had someone give me a fake $5 bill while working at burger King when I was young (16 or 17).  I'm ashamed to say I didn't catch it.  It looked and felt real but it was like the picture on the front was sliding off the paper it was bizarre.  The back looked perfect which is why I missed it.  Who examins a $5 bill especially durring a lunch rush I just saw it was $5 and shoved it into the drawer.
Love it how everything has happened in his career
Well done on being one of the top 5 channels on trending for shorts
You guys don't have the fake money tester thing?
Plot twist: it was a real $100 bill just an old one
Has anyone ever walked In with a gun?
You’re working at subway . You e already been being scammed fool lol
He wasn't mad because he was trying to scam you, he was mad because he just realized he got scammed by the guy that gave him the fake $100.
A good way to not accept fake notes I'd to say "sorry we don't accept bills higher than $20" 🤷🏼‍♀️
That’s a test if someone genuinely knows that their money is fake or not. I was once given change that contained a counterfeit $10 bill. I went to go use it somewhere and the guy behind the counter told me it was fake. I honestly didn’t know it was cause I didn’t think anything of it. I went back to store that gave me it and they corrected it. Sometimes, people just don’t check for it. I’ve been a cashier and I always fan out and check any bill over $5 for counterfeiting. This guy knew his bill was fake because of his reaction. People are mostly genuine, but getting defensive immediately is a knee-jerk reaction to guilt.
But maybe someone else gave him the money that he worked hard for. And then he thought it was real
I always had this one random thought that what if someone had a fake dollar bill and they didn’t know that, and they try to pay for something with that dollar bill.
I think i lost braincells
No its just an older bill😭
Not all $100 bills have the strip made into it. The older versions did not have a strip. Older versions either were normal or had a water mark.   Money can feel irregular because the the bill wasn’t in circulation long enough. New bills from the band will look new and have little to no crease or marks. When bills get into circulation more, it will eventually have a used feeling.
I’ll take things that never happened for 500
Do you have just want to eat all the peproinns or bacon?
Malaby you sound like sad and it’s making me sad
That was an awesome story, I'm blown away at how smart this guy is
so many subways say no $50 or $100 only up to $20’s cash
I'm sorry but scamming with high bills is so stupid?? Like chances are you'll get away with scamming lower bills more.
Thats the thing about scams though. You only know it's a scam if you caught onto it. You never know about successful scams. At retail for a few years it was amazing to see how many coworkers would accept fake bills either because they didn't notice. Didn't care or just weren't away and a few of them to this day will say they have never been scammed
Holy crap this is whats trending? Youtube really is going down the shitter
Hey Madrid how many Karen's have you met
Maybe the guy got scammed and didn’t even know it, then tried to use it at ur subway
I guarantee people could scam you. You're working at subway.
You scam YouTube a lot bro ... !
then he called the cops and the guy got strangled to death
No one: Has anyone brought Cherynobl to the Subway? Macaroni and Cheese: So one time someone brung Ukraine to the Subway and gave us chemical reactions! :)
Not all $100 bills have the strip
So has anyone gave birth at your store? Milad: so one time.....
Scam malid 🚫 Get free cookie from malid✅
Home Depot is notorious for giving fake money.
Day 182.  Monopoly man, have you ever needed to call the cops on someone and if you can only put one thing on a sandwich and eat it what would it be
i was waiting for an interesting aspect of that non- story.
Waiting for the story to get good then it restarts lmao
I ruined 666 comments ahahha
Scam artist subway
Hmm
Gorge Floyd’s moment
Has anyone seen you drop a sandwich before
I gotta say one time I had a fake 5 dollar bill and didn't know it, anyway I went to a store and tried to buy something and the cashier noticed that it was fake, I was surprised it was fake it was the first time something like that ever happened to me, luckily it was only 5 bucks and not a larger amount because she confiscated it and kind of made me feel and look like a criminal, it was pretty offensive and embarassing and I felt she was quick to assume a lot of things in her head about me considering the stink eye she gave me, definitely pissed me off because it was an honest mistake, I dont examine everyone of my bills to make sure they're real. And it was only 5 dollars, lady acted like I tried to rob the church collection plate... Geez Louise.
Plot twist: it was just an older $100 dollar bill
Has anybody tried to rob you
If you confess Jesus as Lord and believe He was raised from the dead you will be saved. Romans 10:9
Prove it well you Make a sandwich at your wonderful job
Bro you should of called the cops that shits super illegal and you can get a huge reward for turning people in for that.
When you get scammed remember what you just said.  You'll learn.  Only time I gave you a thumbs down.
Much love FROM South Africa
$100 bills from 1970’s or before don’t have the strip
plot twist, it was an old $100 bill without the blue strip
Maybe someone scammed him and he was unaware it was counterfeit.
Has anyone came in and said “don’t be shy put some more” on one specific ingredient?
If they get mad when you call them on it...its 100% fake
so the answer is yes
I don't care what you say anymore bro you wouldn't give somebody a sandwich over $0.02 I hope he did scam your ass
hi
Epil
What was the sub he was making
Your life is so interesting man ??
U hold it up to the light for the watermark not the strip
Maind has someone ever come in and ask for a job
What is the point of this video? "Guys here's this story: the guy showed me a fake bill and I told him to get lost", wow, how fucking exciting. I'm sure glad I spent 26 seconds of my time to watch this garbage
*Slides over $100 monopoly cash*  This is the real stuff man, straight from the source
Should of called the police
This is weird, it’s policy that workers can’t take videos or photos of the inside of the restaurant
He’s probably been scammed hundreds of times with smaller notes.  He’s like “you can’t scam me”… someone hands him a hundred dollars to pay for a couple dollar sandwich, of course it’s likely a fake.  I bet he’s accepted so many fake dollar bills though.
Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” So they said, “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.”
No cookie for you, scammer!
The spicy Italian gets 10 of each bro
My humble opinion I’ve never seen a more pointless video
“OMG SO INSPIRING LITERALLY SOMEONE TRIED THIS THE OTHER DAY”
Milad gives me male Karen vibes sometimes
Perks of being in Canada: fake bills dont exist
I hate how people are this dumb to not realize that not all 100 dollar bills have strips. The strip is a new concept and every person in this comment section is now dumb enough to call a 100 dollar bill fake money
is no one gonna talk about how delicious that sandwich looks
What strip on a 100 dollah bill? Shoe me on eive never seen a bill in my entire life (im not america)
Plot twist this clown don’t know how to tell real from fake money
Either you give me real money or I'll call the police ... Ha nobody can scam me I'm not scared
This story is so generic, what was the point?
Imagine going to subway and seeing a go pro attached to their head
I literally stopped watching him 6 months ago. Now he's here.
Worst story ever
Pre 1996 didn't have UV strips but if it didn't feel like the cotton blend then it wss probably a fake
Heads up, there are older 100 dollar bills pre 1996 that don't have the watermark. If it was an older bill it could have been legit but still better safe than sorry.
The way I tell if there fake is I look for a head on the right
At the restaurant i worked at, the managers had the cashier's bring them the 100 or 50 dollar bill to verify. So just in case, its not on the employees if its fake, its on the manager.
There’s $100 bills that don’t have stripes that are still in circulation
Devils Advocate: Some of these folk are too young to understand the old $100 bills dont have a blue strip, and he just thought it was fake because it was old.
Plot twist- it was george floyd
But the mane question is have u worked with odds1sout??
When I worked at Wawa, a man asked me for a large sub with ONLY lettuce!!!!! This was back when we circled the ingredients on the WAWA notepad. 5 minutes later he came in to ask for the manager. Screaming that I had only  put lettuce on his sub. And that he wanted another one for free. I showed my manager his ticket and the manager said sir here’s the ticket, plus we have cameras. He cussed the whole time he walked out the door. 😂
Milardo has anyone stole anything from the store?
Trending LESS GOOOOOO
Plot twist : milad is racist the guy was black
There's actually still $100 bills in use that don't have the blue strip. I've seen it a few times as a cashier and even gotten it from ATMs. Having a money pen is probably a better test in that situation.
John Cena: you can’t see me!    Milad: you can’t scam me
Now, you've just scammed us!
How do you know he was not the victim of a scam and just gave you the money he was given it’s happened to me get paid went to grab a pizza accused of giving fake  cash
"You Can't Scam Me!" -Milard  Sounded like John Cena there.
Has anyone ever tried to rob you
thing is sometimes you get some bs bills from the atm... remember one time i got $400 and every bill minus the one on the top and bottom were torn or ripped , (talking about corners or holes on the bill or even ripped in half) had to end up going to the bank and explaining to them that i got then from the atm  and explained it (how much i got out , time and date) finally got them replaced , these bills were all abused
Bruh I’ve done this as a cashier but it was real it was just old and the bills look different and some don’t even have blue strips if it’s old enough only a little bit newer from that it’s a thin blue strip
You can’t scam me… *B1TCH*
How does subway get pepperoni that big :0~
Not sure who needs to hear this but if you’re going through a hard time I hope things get better for you and your family.
Mr. Mirg is too smart
But who the f*** pays for a Subway sandwich with a hundred-dollar bill
counterfeit
Come on man, we all know you have to make the old year bills
Watching this, I learned that Subway in India is a scam. We don't get this much meat on it. I always ordered double meat.
I've had a guy come in and try to hand another cashier a printed out $100 bill that was extremely off centered and she had me scan it to prove it was fake so the guy would leave. I've also had the same scanners refuse to accept a $100 bill that I know is real lmao.
Imagine if the video started with him saying:  So one time my Nigerian uncle…
I work at a major retailer, the thing about counterfeit bills is they all feel off, somethings not right. As soon as you touch them you know! I’ve seen plenty. I seen one where they put fingernail polish where the shiny part of the newer bills is and I’ve seen as low as $5.
Has someone ever flirted with you
imagine scamming a subway smh
My brother found a counterfeit 100$ at a festival. It was almost perfect, felt right, had the strip. The only problem was one of the sides was orange. It was wild
Probably not the best way to approach the situation. 90% of the time when people give you fake bills, they didn't know the money was fake. The reason people get upset is because they think you're accusing them of having fake money unjustly. I usually either tell them that their bill didn't pass our validation test or that we don't have enough change in the drawer to break a large bill (if it's a $100 or $50).
Money is slowly losing its value gold is real momey diamonds jewls
That’s happened once to me so I used the counterfeit marker and when it failed I started cutting the 50 dollar with a scissor. Then, In a calm but annoyed tone I said once again , “that’s 35.08”
did someone rob you
Has anyone ever thought that guy could’ve thought the bill was real
It could have been an older 100 dollar bills , older bills didn’t have strips
anything like ~10-20+ years old uses that “second face” as a way to check if it’s counterfeit since those bills were made before the blue strip was but on those bills
It could have been an old 100 dollar bill
Cool story bruh
Not all 100$ bills have that ribbon strip.  They only started doing that about 10ish years ago to make it harder to countfeit.
Some 100 bills don't have that strip it's the old ones maybe you were just wrong lmao
Had any one ever try to rob you
"You can't scam me..." That sounds like a challenge
Dude, you make sandwiches at subway for a living. Stop acting like you’re cool.
"RING EM UP"

Is someone tells you to how to make food
Milad you might have f’d up on that one cuz there are still multiple $100 bills in circulation that don’t have the blue strip. They’re older Versions but they’re still valid I own 2 myself
If someone tried giving me a fake £50 note I’ll quickly take a photo of them and call police i don’t care if they run I’ll have a photo
Or maybe that guy just didn’t know it was fake
Omg is that’s spicy Italian that’s my favorite
Milordardlardycarditardyplardiard
Y can’t people realize. Some of us save our cash😂 old cash is still valid cash
Why does you have all answers we ask you ?
Could he have been using an old 100 dollar bill?
On older bills the strip isn't there you should of checked the date and time of the bill and more than 1 way of identifying a fake
Lmao I remembered the time when I was little and took the strip off because I thought it looked ugly. I hope I didn’t cause too much trouble.
actually old 100 dollar bills don’t have a strip on it
I had this happen with an old bill, and come to find out it was real! I felt so bad for the customer, but better safe then sorry!
So I went into a subway for the first time yesterday and I asked for a 6inch and I start choosing different chicken and and it turns out that I cannot have 2 different types of chicken on one 6inch bread.(is this true)
🚫🧢 I worked at subway and ppl always tried to use fake money 😭😭
Did you put your knee on his neck until he died? Asking for a friend
My he wasnt trying to scam you  Maybe he sold something second hand and buyer gave him a fake bill
If I know it's a fake, I tell them I can't accept $100 bill or a $50 bill.. I work retail and one of my coworkers accidentally accepted a fake
It was probably an older bill
Its funny how sometimes you go offtrack and the story takes a turn “Has anyone every ordered (so said sandwich) Milard:not necessarily but this one time i took a dump ontop of this customers sandwich and thats how i crossed jamal crawford and reincarnated into a slime called rimuru.
You can't scam Mustard
And the man name is George Floyd
I read a Nancy Drew book like 8 years ago where Nancy got in trouble because she had a fake bill and she didn't realize. idk why that scared 10 year old me so hard, but I worry that I accidentally have a fake bill anytime I use cash lmao
bro thats my friends dad, me and my friend went fishing with his dad and we went to eat subway and that’s the same sandwich I ordered
What if he don’t know it was a 100
He will make you  [[A BIG SHOT]]
I got scam by shop lol the shopkeeper give me fake 100 when i refund my shirt b4
Ummm.  Did you check for markers like red and blue fibers?  Did you check the date?  You do realize that the string was not introduced until the 80s.
You do know that there are old 100s without the strip right? 😑
But subway can't allow 20 plus bills I thought
“Has anyone ever sold your organs?”  “So this one time…”
Brah
It could of been we had someone bring in a bill with no blue slip it was just a really old bill but it was legit
MILAD CENA “You can’t scam me”
I had a dude try to quick change me one time with fakes.
Jesus loves you y
Jesus loves you y
You don’t have a counterfeit bill detector pen? That Way you’re always sure
I can scam milad with uno reverse
That’s how you can tell if they were truly trying to scam you. If they get mad and defensive it usually means they knew it was fake and intended to pass it on to you. If their face drops and their tone of voice is worried and upset trying to figure out how it’s fake, that usually means they are a poor soul that had a fake passed onto them without them knowing. When I had a job handling cash, I always felt bad when it was obvious they didn’t know it was fake. Seniors are the most common ones that fall victim to getting fake bills in my experience.
I wouldn’t be surprised if that poor guy got scammed himself and he thought the money was real.
Plot twist: It was a real 100 dollar bill
Not all hundred dollar bills have the blue thing but if it’s real it’s going to have the outline of the person on the bill inside of the bill
Milan I had my first sub
My question. Has anyone just ordered and when you finish they casually just leave
🤦🏼‍♂️
Did a krean
Wow. What a story.
Yeah it has lime a blue strip right
The sandwich you made is my fav with American cheese it’s spicy italion
Do you work at subway?
Wait, isn’t doing that illegal
Now the thing is, I’m a nice person, to the point of being naïve, so I would have been like “Sir, I think you’ve been scammed! This bill is fake!”
Its milk mirag
Just because a $100 doesn't have that blue strip doesn't mean it's fake, the strip is a recent addition
Plot twist it was george floyd
um who’s gonna tell him that older 100’s don’t have the security strip 😐
I got a tik tok telling me how to spot fake money right after this. Is YouTube trying to say something?
mijab can not be scammed
Your supposed to call the police…
Hi
naybe he got scammed
Where I work we confiscate the fake money and call the cops. They usually take off before they cops come.
When you put the ham back I thought you dropped it
What if the guy didnt know its fake? Give us more detail.
Damn
One time I was at subway with my dad and sister (keep in mind my dad has an accent and doesn’t have the best English) so we are eating subway in the mall and one of the employees storms to my dad and starts yelling at my dad and saying that he didn’t pay even tho my dad gave them his card then my dad is like what do you mean and the man keeps yelling I’m calling security he didn’t even tell my dad to pay now and the man kept yelling have a good day while walking back and saying I’m calling security
I love hard salami
Suiiiiiiii
No I’m 7
You realize they’re still 100 dollar bills with no strip right I have a bunch of them and I tested them and they’re all real
"Has anyone ever gave you a gun while you are working?" Milad: So there's this one time..
Lmao what's funny is this actually happened but milad didn't step up , he emptied his pockets and gave me everything he had on him, I robbed that bitch quick
Not all $100 bills have a blue strip they have only had them for the past couple years look it up
It might have been real the old 100 dollarrs are still worth 100$ and they dont have a blue line and it looks kinda sketchy but there real
You picked the wrong subway fool ! 😂
Good girls except its a knock-off
Lol 😂  “At the you can’t scam!”
i actually found a real $100 bill without the strip. it was just suuuper old
He is lying
Well if u get a old enough 100 they don’t hav a strip
My forensics teacher has a bunch of stories, and she got detained because she was (unknowingly) carrying a funny $5 bill, and protocol calls to detain my teacher until the cops come.
That’s kinda like what happened with Earn in Atlanta
Every cashier at every business knows the fake money scam.  50s are the most common.  I've seen fake 5s and 10s too.
That's happened to me at McDonald's. The kid gave a crumpled 100 like it was in the wash but the money felt too thick. It felt like crafting paper. So I asked him (what u want me to do with this). He was like oh my bad then he gave me a 20. I know I was suppose to take ot but he was a kid so I let it go that time
What's the most amount of money some one has tipped
Legend has it that milad pins people who can't go to his subway bc he can't give them a free cookie
That "bread" be looking gross
"GRRRRR.. NOW IM GETTING MAD"
Foood!!!:)
Maybe he got scammed too
Let's vote for milad changing his name back to milard
Imagine scamming for a sandwich 💀
So what did he do?
Older bills don’t have the strip milad. Dick.
I thought every subway had a "no bill over 20" rule anyways
Me: Scams Milad for cookies 🍪
I don't care
Not all hunnids have a strip buddy lmao..only the blue hundreds do
Maybe he got scammed 😁🍆💊
Yk its fake when they get mad lmao
You either give me real money or i'll call the secret service on yo ass
Mango has anyone came in asking for everything on his sub
You’re think it would be pretty hard to scam a sandwich shop
Maybe he didn't know
Has anyone ever came in complaining about a missing ingredient for their sub milard
"You can't scam meh"
Ahh. George Floyd vibes
Facts Milad facts
Old 100 dollar bills don't have the strip
I feel like subway is overpriced?
I work at an Arby's and had this happen to me. My register has a counterfeit marker in it, and when I put an 100 bill through the test and it failex
Milad br like - there was only one time 😹
Has someone ever tried to steal a sandwich or chips
They're lucky they were dealing with you and not some employee who would've called the cops right away.
As they always say, “too good to be true”
One time when I was doing deposits I found a fake ass $100. It was thin like paper and wasn't printed in English. Looked over past transactions and camera feed, found out a guy paid $3 for a fountain drink and got $97 in real cash back 🙃
he’s too young to know not all $100 bills have that blue strip
Has anyone ever shat in youre subway while making it yeah there was this one time
did some one ever say they were a famous and wanted something free
😂
Milmird has anyone ever tried trading for a sandwich
My friend gave me a fake prop money and I didn’t see it I gave it to the employee and they called the police on me I even tried to explain but I told the police and my friends backed me up about it luckily my friend got fined only 100 dollars so we cool now
Do you ask people if you can record there sandwich?
Bro why this video have like 3 verified ppl in the top comments already-??

I’m more confused by who uses a 100 dollar bill to pay for subway
Milad is just too powerful
George Floyd
If someone tried to scam me i would say “u can’t bullsh*t the bullsh*ter”
Plot Twist: The money was from Australia and the money was from before there was no transparent strip.
This guy doesn't know how lucky he is. That can lead you to 20 years in prison if you even do fake coins
My subway doesn't take bills more than $20
A lot of money in circulation is fake so idk how anyone could say for sure counterfeits are done on purpose
That’s illegal
milaward coward have you ever messed up a sandwich recipe?
Has anyone tried to brake the window to get the food without paying
That “you can’t scam me” is giving very much John cena “you can’t see me” 💀💀💀
100% real story
There are 100 dollar bills without holo strips though there are still plenty of the former design in circulation so yeah it was probably real money
AND???
Anyone starting to think these stories milad telling us is fake??
Maybe I’m wrong but I think $100 bills before 2013 didn’t have the blue strip. Milad may be wrong on this one.
“Have you ever killed someone” (Milad) “well there was this one time:”
The older 100 dollar bills don’t have the blue strip on them is so it could probably be real
You should call the police
You should give him the scamwich.
You can’t scam the mighty Mickey Mouse
the audacity!
Did I ask?
Mallard duck
Where I used to work we had a scanner that beeped when it was real, I’ve caught multiple people trying to give me fake money and can tell immediately if it’s real or not
Wait but not every 100 dollar bill has the blue strip. Is it possible this guy is just an idiot?
I feel like SubWay right now…
Cap
Mikey did any youtuber come to ur subway? And who?
Older 100's have no strip but ya the bill was probably not real
Some $100 bills don’t have strips tho
Damn bro really tried to scam Michael.
i mean to be fair, not every 100 bill has the blue strip. there’s still ones in circulation that don’t have it. you should test it with a pen.
Plot twist: It was real and Milard is just rolling in the dough
Milad is a good guy and this is bc of his knowledge and skills
I was accused of having fake $100 bills once.  They're not. They're just old. And I have LOTS and LOTS and LOTS of them. No magnetic strip. Mine are all pre-1980.
I've been accused of passing fakes a couple times.  Once when they changed the $20's, the clerk at Arby's told me to knock off the attempted joke or she'd call the police.  I suggested she call the manager, first.  She did and the manager came over, rolled his eyes, and said something like "Carmen!  We talked about this in the meeting yesterday!  These are the new bills!"  And recently I handed $10 to a TacoBell window clerk at 11pm and as she was about to put it in the register, some 17yo snot next to her grabbed it from her hand and started screaming, literally shouting to the whole store, it's a fake!  Look at this!  It's a fake.  Manager came, ran it through the "is it fake" scanner and it came back fine.  Kid insisted "no!  This is fake!  It's FaKe!"  Manager did the motherly "time to knock it if off, Steven" stare and the kid shut up.  I got my lovely Nachos Bell Grande without further incident.
You should call the police, but you didint cuz you  are a morron.
"You can't scam milad" wanna test that theory
Milird, has any wild animals ever came into your subway?
Has anyone ever try to sue you
This happens a lot
Why counterfeit big bills? I get counterfeiting Is.wromg and illegal bit wouldn't you want to play it safe and fake like a dollar bill or something
No one can scam moulan
The old 100 dollar bills didn’t have the blue strip
To test fake money they all shred with a slight bit of water and rubbing
Try white bread with cold steak and provolone quac banana peppers tomato lettuce and salt and pepper
I'd honestly do this with the actual money in the middle
Older 100s don’t have the band 😐😐
The real way to tell if a dollar bill is fake or not is to give it a good sniff.
You can’t scam the great milard
Malery do you mean the blue strip? If so then there are still the old $100 bills that are real but don’t have the strip.
Maybe he didnt have real money 🤔
Don't scam Milad or else he won't give you a free cookie 😐
Why do you say "samwich"?
you already posted this
Milad I really like your videos and you inspired me to get my first job at subway
They take high value fake bills like 100 and 50 and they spend it so they get back real money from the change so they might sacrifice a fake 100 and spend 5 bucks to get back 95 dollars in real cash.
Why that paper look like printer paper
Were you making a Turkey Italiano in this video?
Millard have you ever got into a fight?
Ive been a cashier at several places over the last few years. The way i see it is not everyone who has a counterfeit bill has malicious intent or anything like that, it’s entirely possible that they were given the bill by someone else and didnt know it was fake
Awful, basic story
Hey milod which comments do you recognize and make a vid about
So a fake $100 bill will feel a lil too thick and too clean, but not all $100 bills have a blue strip.
Has other subways try to sabotage your subway?
Bro is the bacon used in the subs r beef bacon or pork bacon....???
Ogs will know its a reupload
Hey Mustard, Make a sub with Blue cheese.
Day 4 of asking what's your wackiest order
Hey is there any way to get the bread from subway without going? Like do they sell Italian herbs and cheese bread anyway besides subway?
Everything has happened with this guy
People always get mad when their fake money doesn’t work. Not really sure why.
Cant go 3 seconds without seeing a video from him. Fine bro I'll get a godamn sub...again 😔
Mirage, did you ever bully anyone or got bullied by anyone ?
🤣
some of the older 100s dont have the strip at least I dont think
"You cant scam meh" so peaceful
Had the same thing happen to me except it's possible that was actually a 100 bill. It wasn't until the late 2000s that paper money had so many security marks and identifiers. So it's very possible that dollar bill was from the late 90s to early 2000s
Milad can you make an sqid game cookie
The old ones had no strip btw
Was it George Floyd?
I've had many 100$ bill without the blue strip and 100% be real, newer 100$ have them and older ones do not
What’s the weirdest sandwich combo you’ve ever made?
Hate to be that guy but you do know pre 2013 $100 bill did not have a blue stripe
This story is fake
You sure it wasnt an old hundred dollar bill bro?  Theres no strip on those, and they do feel different.  Did milad scam himself?
Milk ad I ain't ever seen a Philly cheese steak from subway
Have you ever wanted the emergency room
i hate when people do wrong things then get angry because you caught them
Older bills don’t have that and feel different than normal every day money so you prolly passed up an expensive bill , the letter on the left always matches the number on the right, if not you got urself a fake note
It’s sucks because he probably got scammed with that hundred
It may have been fake, but 9 times outta 10 they got it from change from the store or something and had no idea or any intention to push counter fit money. They just got change from some store who actually got scammed
Do you eat youre own food most of the time.
Milly, How do you make loop.  big fan. Love from 🇮🇳India
Massage do u hv veg food at Subway
Believe in JESUS today, confess and repent of your sins. No one goes to heaven for doing good but by believing in JESUS who died for our sins. So please do this so you don't go to hell. GOD loves you so much unconditional and doesn't want to see you in hell❤❤❤

Milad mirg : a adult 23 or 24 year old guy  Also milad mirg : has stories like 60 year old guy worked at subway for 30 years like legit.
I dont need to scam you now that I know you have an ugly dude discount lol
Samdwich
Milardo, can you tell what kind of person someone is based on what they get on their sub.
you cant scame meh
Fun fact in canada it's very common for any establishment to just not accept $100 Bills because of the big counterfeiting problem from a few years back.
I bet that guy went to different stores and found one that excepted it lol.
You didn't try the counterfeit pen?
Milad:That'll be 8 dollars   Scammer:Hands him a one of those toy 1,000,000 dollar bills  Milad:What is This?   Scammer:Keep the change 😉  Milad:John Cena theme plays in the background  YOU CAN'T SCAM ME!!! as he's waving his hand in front of his face.   Scammer:Makes a run for it while Milad just eats his sandwich.
Big fan
What a amateur. Should have used Monopoly money
"Has anyone ever brought a nuclear bomb?" Milad: "So there was this one time where... "
I swear, Milad has stories about everything
wht if the note was real  and milad is just stupid
Big brain milard
What did he look like
I mean he probably could if he wasn’t stupid lol
Have you ever had any prank calls?
that 100% bill 100% got into circulation and he was unlucky and got it. Fake bills are not worth frauding it costs way to much to buy ont he black market. You only double your money plus the included risk of using fake currency its not worth it. Plus who will use fake 100$ bill which u pay like 50$ for to buy a sub at subway. Makes no sense.
Subway doesn’t take bills over 20 🤨
Has anyone come in asking if the subway was a wendys?
Dead giveaway should have been that used a 100 dollar bill at subway
Mayflower is subway a good place to work?
Yh I got scammed £50
You can’t scam mildred but also there are still $100 bills in circulation since before they put the blue strip on it, I think it was about 2010 or sun when they put them on idk I can’t remember
Have you seen a Karen
Did they give u real money
Then he called you a racist?
Me not paying attention to what he saying and just counting how many slices of meat he put on the samich... which was 6...
“You can’t scam mehh” 😂
I know what’s also really helpful is a counterfeit marker as well for newer people who can’t tell if it’s real or not
Milad Milid Milord Milard Milird Milarg
Somebody: Has anyone paid you a nuclear bomb? Milardimus Maximus:Sooo there was this one time
How to make a cookie
What if he didn’t know and now you’re calling him a scammer and telling him to get out 😂😂
Milad have you ever given any of your subscriber free sandwich
If you called the cops on him for using fake money.. that may have been another George Floyd situation.  so next time call the police if someone is using fake money
is subway bringing back roast beef cause i miss it
Bro that's a scam from the start, who pays with 100$ for 1 sandwich
Had a guy years ago attempt to give me actual Monopoly money to pay for his fuel/lottery tickets.
Mario have you ever got in problems because of something you didn’t do in school
You should always check the money you get because the customer could have gotten it from someone else and now he has a fake hundred that he can't use
"You can't scam meh!"
Megamind have you ever encountered a fight while working
Why has this video not blown up yet?
What you mean? That’s an authentic $107.03 bill
I love how people get mad when they get called out
💫You can't scam meh💫
No joke, this dude gave me a bill PRINTED BACKWARDS. He left & came back with a freshly-printed bill with the ink still wet.
“You can’t scam me”
RANDOM PERSON: has an alien ever came to ur store?  Milard: so their was this one day...  this is a joke only please don’t take seriously. Sorry if I sounded rude
What skills subway has taught you over the years?
Mikey, what is the best sauce for sliced chicken sub?
It’s funny how people’s logic works.  “Sir this is a fake 100$ bill” The guy: *gets mad*
Do you somethimes invent a story ?
This happened to my dad but the person ran away. Funny thing is they tried doing to a Panera  down the street an hour later and got caught
I once went to the shop for dairy when the man told him that he was scammed with fake money and that he even gave the change.Its disappointing.
What’s your recommendation for someone who is new to subway
NEVER do this. It's not worth it. The FBI will get involved, Milan you should have reported it lol.
Milad what is your favourite nickname
Hey Arldmil, What is the weirdest order you’ve gotten from a costumer?

Plot Twist: it was just an old 100 dollar bill that doesn’t have the purple strip and has the purple stamp mark thing.

A nicer way of saying it is, sir, would you have any other Bills? If he says no, then you say it's fake.
It could of been an older 100$ bill only the newer ones have the strip
Milard be like "THIS MONEY IS FAKE...heres a cookie
