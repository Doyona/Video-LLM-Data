The talent these 3 have is much beyond cars.  They should be nominated as conservative, labour and Liberal Democrat’s party leaders. They’ll bring some sense and humour to our policies.
Unless the mustang is pushing 1500 hp with the rb I aint listening
hammond roast the stig porsche turbo
4:43  I hear an attempt at a deep throated classic Clarkson in that "yes."
Who....... are these people?
Yo I thought jackultramotive would feature
1:49 that noise had be crying 🤣
the first one i can agree with how he ruined the mustang
5:14  At this point of the video, Richard tells Whistlin Diesel to look into his heart. I can only agree.  The amount of perfectly clean, still running things that the kid destroyed, the abomination of a, "monster truck," he created, and the constant complaining with every truck he buys, when all he's gotta do, is inspect the thing, take it for a test drive, and see the problem before he hands over more money than it is worth.  And now, he's gone and ruined a nice Audi.... The guy just doesn't know when to stop.
it is the freakinstein mustang from tokyo drift 🎉❤
So what if the ex Stig takes his 911 through a carwash.
Schmeee is obviously hot for Collete.
This is me, but with sneakers 😂😂😂
"I'm a nice guy"...... immediately burns TF out of all the idiots.
I like Shmee150 but his taste in colors is horrible.😊
Why do self proclaimed influencers always successfully turns a perfectly built car into a hideous chimera.
Lmaso, it make car go faster…… maybe 😬
I’m thinking lack of parental supervision 😮😂
Oh, is that aloud ! It’s Mustang …… does he need medication help 😬
come on hammond, the mustang was inspired by the rb 26 swapped mustanf from ff tokyo drift
Hasnt whistlindiesels car been on a lie detector
Thoughts of 2005 xtype with donner x-type same year for 2k? Original not molested ..drives like a dream...lil rocket on interstate!
Actually Collette does like the pink car she always does that to her cars but she is also not 50 60 years old lol I could imagine the stuff Richard did to his cars in his late teens early 20s lol
Actually bumber delete with titanium exhaust twin turbo is awesome
Come on shmee lambo is amazing. I guess top gear guys if it's not fully stock its wrong
Tj did that with the mustang just to make a replica of the fast and furious Tokyo drift car
And what’s wrong with Barbie race cars?!?!
Why would you get glass engine bmw should have bought a Audi r6!🤘🇨🇦
Stop being nice... it's a roast! Lol
Tj did the Tokyo drift thing
I like the R8 on display kinda reminds me of the Batmobile 😂 looks p cool to me
I'm surprised the Audi R8 isn't totaled because that's usually what he does with all his vehicles
shmee has THE worst taste
Nailed most... The Mustang was just wrong all the way to those horrible wheels. If you needed to use that Skyline engine then get an old Datsun 510 and make something cool. Why destroy a $150K car? The Huracan was truly hideous... Can't wait for the next Gentle Roast...
The Shmee150 part 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
I’m here after shmee’s latest one
"Gentle roasting." just a slight char on the finish 😅😂😅
Yeah shmee has the worst spec i ve ever seen on an sto
Hey why not create a collab with donut media!!!
You can roast my 2017 Jaguar F-Type Premium that I Transformed into a nerd car with the engine tune. 😜
I love how some of these are so frustrating he can't even word how many things are wrong with them
I like the Mustang with the RB26 likely inspired by the Mustang in Tokyo Drift
0:39 I don't think Hammond has seen Tokyo Drift has he?
Shmee always made very spec for is cars, most millenial/zoomer influencer do in fact.  Also I cannot stand shmee voice and weird smile/face
Never thought I'd so much as hear mention of Ben Collins again from any of them. Maybe the whole 'animosity' following his book was just for show for Top Gear.
That’s the gayest lambo i ever seen.
Can you roast some of Rich Rebuilds weird creations?
I stopped watching Shmee for numerous reasons....mostly his choice in colors of his cars was the main reason. I just couldn't get over that horrible green automatic shelby mustang.
Shmee is insufferable.
Amazing
No one gives a puck you roast others cars
Ein Kommentar
5:48 poor Hamster on the verge of tears at all that pink. 😂
What a beautiful hunk of a man
The mustang is a Tokyo drift replica but it is still a godsent engine in a filthy lazy muscle car
Shmee Huracan looks like a... Catfish
2:00 Discount MCU's The Vision paintjob
The E61 you can take measures to protect that engine.
americans love roasting peoples cars don’t they
Bumper no fit on r8:(
I always wonder why he looks like Hugh Jackman 😁
After years of watching Hammond on top gear and the grand tour he would be a master therapist
#shmee150
Would love to see him do DMO Deejay’s Honda Jazz 😂
4:29 the guy isn't right in the head to begin with. Shot steel targets at 4 feet away with a 0.50 cal
So Youtubers either wanna ruin everybody's lives or wanna drive around in a Quailty Street Machine.
That wasn't even a roast, really...more of a light searing. The video was well done, but the vehicles and influencers...I'd say they got off more medium-rare, honestly.
Iron Man doppelganger
0:17 this idiot has been watching that piece of garbage called TFATF Tokyo Drift way too much.
Hichard Rammond
Ok… I loved the look of that first mustang but when Hammond said he took the V8 out and replaced it with a Skyline engine… that deserves prison time.
Getting roasted by Hammond is a dream come true
kkkkkk so like that stangs v8 must have blown right? no way someone swaps for an RB lol
Shmee..... How the F*CK does this guy call himself a car guy?? And how the F*CK is he popular??????
HHAAAAAMMMMMMMMMOOOOOONNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDDDDDD USE YOUR MIRRORS  Lol
I actually like the colour of Shmee’s car
Truly patrician taste Richard.
Ben Collins, aka the Stig.
That Lamborghini was violated.
You should do stradman
Love how nobody in the comments achnowledges that Hammond roasted the Stig.
learn to roast
Why am I not surprised that Whistling Diesel had one of the more disgusting cars of this video?
Whistlin Diesel is nuts
Ive watched 3 or 4 of these youtube influencer vids, and ive yet to see, boosted boyz, McFarland, carwow, hagarty, hoonigan, carwow. Come on who are these ppl? Not in my algorithm.
I've never hated something so much I like as much as Whistlin' Diesel's R8.
not gonna lie i thought that R8 was a Bentley at first with the Grill
Hammond, that Stang was inspired from Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift
the yellow trim on the huracan looks like a pencil mustache to me
Jeremy punching that producer was the best thing that could of ever happened to top gear fans
Schmee doin the Maccas classic with that STO
😂 😂 🤣 🤣 yep... Shmee
I can't hear what he's talking about half the time
2:01 he's speaking the language of the gods
*“Frankenstein’s Mustang”*
In the case of T.J. Hunt he looks like he made a replica of the GT350 from  fast and furious Tokyo drift
He should review some of Westen champlin's builds next, pretty curious what he'd have to say about some of them😂
Am I the only person, that thinking is Richard is ovesizing 'bad tuning'? Now his roasting 'just nice cars' , and not 'so bad' ideas... And for other casual people, Lord Hammond is saying - 'You peasants! I will even not spit on your cars'...
He destroyed them all with words.
Ben Collins
Im pretty sure the RB26 mustang was a shell without an engine before he put the engine in it as a reference to Tokyo Drift
you should have roasted james mays mirai
He roasted the (stigs) porsche lol Ben Collins 😃
1:54 I have an inkling someone is a fan of G1 Transformers Hot Rod (Rodimus Prime). That’s the only rational reason for that paint job I can think of. Why not go all the way, why the coy referential paint?
I actually liked the barbie car
hope that m3 has been making faster lap times than yours, Richard
Someone should show hammond western champlin's ford mustang with its 12-valve Cummins deasil
I love his utter disgust.  Horrific moding should involve a prison sentence
TJ tried to be Sean Boswell and mix American with Japan.
Love that Huracan!
Should do DDEs Lamborghini hurrican 'aperta'
Proof that most YouTubers aren't deserving of money or these cars.
Roast mine!    😂🤣
Hammond looks like Robert Downey Dr. tell me im wrong
Is it just me or does Shmee's Huracan look like Hulk Hogan?
Got it spot on with Shmee’s car. Dreadful.
Only thing nice thing I can say about TJ’s mustang is that it’s based on the one in Tokyo Drift
I think Matt Armstrong is amazing
Hammond is rigjt about the R.B-2.6 Mustang. Use an ond 6 banger Mustang to build it. Dont use a nice one. The one from Tokyo Drift is a 1967, not a 65.
1:52 You only do this is in videogames, not in real life. Ouch, my eyes
looks like TJ Hunt recreated the Fastback from Tokyo Drift
The reaction to the GT 350 is hilarious. Frighteningly appalling is it? Quite so. Would you swap a SBF into a Skyline? Probably not.
You definitely should roast this guy https://www.youtube.com/user/AcademeG/videos! :)
Seems like shmee's eyes work about as well as that fat tongue he has.
the r8 isn't brown. it looks better in the sunlight
Brown
immediately out the gate reminded me why I love Hammond.  Repeat that and I will deny it.
hahah
If person not owned or planning own vehicle for 3-5 years its not/yet their project car.
I want to see him and James both roast the cars that Aging Wheels has. The Wheego, the Reliant, the Coda, the Trabant, the Saab, the Fiesta, the XC90, the c30, the school bus, the Durango, the F150, and the e500...  And yes, I know, he has sold some of those cars by now, but still, it would be funny to hear what Hammond has to say about those things. And definitely May. I get the feeling James would laugh very hard when he realized that the driver seat in the trabant reclines just a bit too far.
you know you don't like it 😆
Shmee’s is actually disgusting, normally I say to each their own but that thing is just messed up. He’s made a 2021 Lamborghini look 10 years old! 🤮
01:54 I actually like that purple metal flake - But that yellow bumber let's it down  - just no no! - 🤮 yuck!
Kinda shocked Tim (150) ain't responded, tbh
This video and comments show me that people will hate on anyone doing better than them and are afraid to be different and value the option of others. Can’t look at yourself in the mirror
Jeremy should roasts YouTubers' cars
when you have someone who's been an influence on the car community like Richard Hammond ROAST your car... that's an obvious sign you are doing something wrong.
The v10 on the bmw is solid as I am currently driving mine with 218k miles on it and track my other one that's approaching 190k miles
Ben collins the OG stig
Nice tokyo drift troll. Lol
You clearly never saw Tokyo Drift 🙄
The guy with the Lambo must be colourblind. I mean, WHO would INTENTIONALLY paint his supercar with a colour that looks like someone has been sick all over it after having eaten eggplants with lemon.
It’s funny how I would love a lot of these paint jobs on various mechs, but I find that they just look so weird on cars.
If the Mustang was clapped out and they did that build fine who cares about a Nissan engine but to take a survivor and do that makes my stomach turn.
linus tech tips "lambo" should be on here
That Audi R8 looks awful, why do that?
You may think it’s ok to criticise other peoples tastes in cars you may even feel qualified to do so ! But at the end of the day when you look in the mirror you know that however rich you get and no matter how successful you become you will never be anything other than the prince in shrek  You’ll always be a small man !
2:35 this needs to be a meme template
I don’t know any of the people he’s roasting, so zzzzzz
I mean Cody bought the r8 like that and didn’t have a say in any mods that went on it or the colour, its no longer “brown” (it was pearlescent purple and never actually brown) and is now green so it can be the same colour as both monster maxs, in fact that photo was from before he crashed it on day one of owning it and then had it completely redone
Does he really know these people or he got some background info? Because i have never heard of 90% of these people or their cars :D
Ben, dont go through the automatic carwash man. Spray it down man.
bro can u review stradmans car?
He made the mustang better.. sort of... still can't go around a corner but it will be faster and better.
Love the Shmee150 reaction!
I love Shmee's subtle comment to Richard in one of his videos. Right under the belt.
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷👏🏻, Lol, 😂 you’re terrible! That’s fair play tho Lol…
Shmees Hurracan has a color scheme befitting of only the finest Honda Civic. Driven by the most Rican of Puerto Ricans, In Florida,  Daytona to be specific.
Schmee is nasty
Sometimes forget how traditionalist car guys Richard James and Clarkson are.
This has to be the best one yet. Hammond's genuinely offended by some of the cars he's seeing! 🤣🤣🤣
When Richard reviewing cars wear simple casual clothes. But when roasting YouTubers wearing a nice suit. Richard always my favourite 😂😂
He's right Shmee has no taste. And when it comes to colours Shmee's  just worst.
The Brown reference was great
Shmee, his eyes and brain clearly works because “Puppi” is absolutely gorgeous in every way.   Shame his taste in women, doesn’t show in his car collection.
Thank you for being honest Richard. All of Shmee’s car specs drop at least $100k off their value imo.
2:45 isn’t that the old Stig? 😂
So it's just a British geriatric telling us how boring he has gotten? Next he'll be on laxative commercials telling us the importance of being regular. Seems to have something against modifying cars and bright colors.
this roast is the dark chocolate bar of regret
You should roast my car
Shoutout Mat
Awesome sauce. What is your feeling's on first generation DSM's. Talion, Conquest, up to the Stealth RT twin turbo/ 3000 GT VR4.
😂😂😂
Top Gear episodes (Downloadable) https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14-nFq_FcoX0IK_A_GRJy9Uwz3NipcEzG  If you are thinking of downloading 'em, ask me for a nice hint. Cause they are big, I have a trick to make em small for downloading.  It has all episodes from Top Gear 2002 till 2015 i.e. Series 22 and 2 Specials that they did for special cause You can search this 2 specials for wher they come in the series. That's what I did😛.
HAMMOOOOOOOND!
Moooore!
not sure if you've had the team look at this youtuber yet, but go check out Benjamin Workshop's Ford Gt build. Think they'll get a kick! Loving the content, keep up the great work :)
TJ’s Gt350 is a clone not a real gt350… that would be blasphemy
Shmee150's Huracan could've been nice if it weren't for the yellow accent on the magenta. It's not purple or dark purple, or violet, it's magenta, it has a pinkish tone to it, it doesn't match with the yellow...  P.S. Hammond is bad at roasting, or maybe that's how Brits do it...kind of politely. Have to send these pics to be roasted by All Def Digital.
Tj hunt is a clown.
We need part 3 pls pls
"But it's brown."
TJ mustang is iconic, it’s supposed to be like the one from Tokyo Drift
I'd love to see him react to some of Whistlin Diesel's videos.
LE HAMOND " BROWN " 😂😂
Shmees hurcans colours was factory made
Im telling you the more I see Shmees lambo the better it gets!
Shmee150 lambo color is perfect
Take in a Car from Jean Pierre Kraemer (JP Performance)
See what you have first  And for gods sake they didn't blow a million dollar car like you did!!!!
Show him some ford xr6 turbos and Holden vy ss
When you order al pacino of wish
5:18 He missed the love hearts on the rims 😍
Pretty sure TJ's mustang isn't actually a real gt350, it just has the body kit
Tbh shmee’s lambo wrap is awful 😂
Hahaha your lucky stradman's cars is not there😂
He was making the car from fast and furious Tokyo drift
React to a whistlin diesel video I wanna see that
Shmee's car is designed by a 3 year old kid.  🤣 🤣
I love the STO, gorgeous Shmee
To be fair to TJ, it was a GT350 clone 😂
Encore!
Why is Richard slowly becoming Laurence Llewellyn-Bowen
quite convinced 5hm33 took some inspiration for his Lambo Color scheme after seeing Collete's Barbie Nissan
Well shmees taste in his clothing range say it all..
Well when Barbie is a sponsor you have to put it on the car.
If you think colletes pink z is crazy, go check out her channel 😂
Could not agree more with the judgment of shmee150s lamborghini. Ugliest paint scheme literally ever.
Does he not get the tokyo drift reference on TJ's mustang?
Was a replica GT350 Hammond
I agree with Hammond about TJ hunts mustang but Its not a GT350 I think its a GT R code 390 but still a shame he ruined a classic
The Mustangs engine is great, the wheels not so much
Did he just roast The Stig?!
I've watched a ton of Top Gear, all of Grand Tour - And seen influencer cars.   I think frankenstein cars are cool.   Freedom of choice is cool ♥️😁
I'm glad somebody is finally calling out Shmee for his ruined STO, that purple/yellow combo is an eyesore!
i love how hammond says tj hunts rb26 mustang is having overheating issues when it actually is
Tj hunts mustang isn’t actually a gt350 it had the body parts etc added after
I'm pretty sure Tjs mustang wasn't a real gt350 to begin with if that helps
Awesome
Hahaha gypsies
i can say you look very old, your beard look atrocious, what happen to you
roasting. making people feel bad that’s the trend nowadays. mocking people about their taste
after a great carrier in TV. , sad to see him doing this kind of thing in youtube to get some youtube money. i supposed he got the perfect car. he got the best taste. everyone has their owe taste  no need to judge.
Finally! Someone who gets it regarding "bumper deletes"!
ill never understand why people just want to see cars in the same 5 colors with nothing done to them. i applaud people for being more unique
wait how are you supposed to wash your porsche then?
Shmee murdered that huracan
😂😂😂
Hammond trying to stay relevant by roasting others...
Don't know any of them.
Would love to see a just stradman video like this
Contrary to what clarkson would say, Richard you are better than this, don't do this......
Let Hammond react to T-Pain's drift car.
lol
Right on everything.
TJs mustang was actually just a regular fastback, someone painted it with a gt350 paint scheme
1:55 has me dead
Surprised he hasent done mine yet
HAMMOND!!!!
Hammond!
Shmee’s STO is not that bad especially compared to other STO’s I have seen online and all he did was add the yellow wrap to some sections of the car.
That purple and yellow lambo🤮 it could had been a nice matt gray and orange or matt black red stripes something decent man.
TJ Hunt’s mustang isn’t a real GT350 (nor is it a really clean car) and furthermore, it wasn’t a numbers matching engine anyway. As for as I’m concerned, that car‘s fair game.
Collette Wouldn't be Collette if it wasn't FULL BLAST Neon! That's her whole Brand man. She is the Baldest of Badass Barbie girls =)
With all due respect, heck off Hammond... you could put whatever powertrain under that mustang you want, and it would still be epic... I wouldn't care if he E-Swapped it, it would still be awesome... unless maybe... idk... he e-swapped it with an electric scooter or something... but still.  You keep a car on the road that long, the original engine probably blew up 100k miles ago, what are you going to put in instead?  An LS?
Do DDE or strad
I love Shmees! Wouldn’t have done the yellow but I love the viola bast
Tjs mustang wasn’t a real 350
Wheres clarksons edition of this??
gt350 body kit bucko
Westen Champlin’s Smoke Stang is pretty neat…..you should check it out!
In TJ's defense, his mustang was not a true gt350
Love hammond
imo, shmee’s STO is looking cool.
Shelby gt 350 isn't the best mustang
Hammond!!!
Alex Choi’s Hurucan next 😭
DDE is never on here :(
Tj hunts mustang is like the Tokyo drift stang
Where do i send my Car to Hey roasted?
Tbh, I agree with all he said except for the Mustang. If I remember correctly, it was a ''built'' GT500, not a real one, and that was why he did the conversion.
Not funny at all
Fantastic work man. very entertaining.
You should review the Tate Chiron
I would love to see Hammond's reaction to what Mr Diesel does to most vehicles. Some he might actually approve of, others horrifying.
now we need a jeremy clarkson version of this
ita suppose to be a Frankenstein mustang. because thats what it was in the movie . they Frankensteined a bunch of parts together
I wish Hammond saw WD's Monstermax 2
That hurracan looked like something out of a quality street tin lol but nice car overall.
'is it your eyes, or is it what's immediately behind them?' will live in my head for the rest of my life! Can't wait to use it.
Shmee's lambo looks like a bubble gum wrapper
I hope I’m not the only one when I say  We should get a roasting vid starring Jeremy Clarkson
When are you going to feature Strad with his insistence on white-wheeling everything? The less said about purple the better🤮
I am so surprised he had Whistlin diesels car in there
Greatest roast was calling that r8 BROWN.
It was a replica gt350😂😂
M3s, and all Bimmers are overrated to the 'nth degree. So I disagree with "they just are". They just aren't.
Hahaha anyone spot the STIG and how he ripped into his car lol
Need to see them roast whislin diesels monster max😂
You forgot DDE twin turbs Ferrari
That was a 350 GT Replica !
i dont know if anyone has said this yet, but TJ's mustang isnt a real gt350
sto looks more hideous than the 350z which has the same colour combinations 😭
Huracan be looking like rhubarb and custard
Tj hunts mustang was a real gt350 just a clone
To be fair he kinda made the Mustang off of Tokyo drift
TJs car wasn’t a real GT350 lol
Ben collins…all Hammond said was The man, The legend, The driver…haha we all know he wanted to say “The Stig”😅 they miss him that much after working with him for so many years…if he had said that word Topgear would have sued him!🤣🤣
I'd like to see Hammond react to xqc's collection. He has 3 cars but can't even drive 😂
You should’ve reviewed @Smeedia ‘s flat 6 swapped Subaru WRX STI
He got Whistlin Diesel😂😂
WHAT ABOUT DDE WHAT ABOUT DDE WHAT ABOUT DDEWHAT ABOUT DDEWHAT ABOUT DDEWHAT ABOUT DDEWHAT ABOUT DDEWHAT ABOUT DDEWHAT ABOUT DDEWHAT ABOUT DDEWHAT ABOUT DDEWHAT ABOUT DDE
Yes! I HATE that color. Looks cheap. Talking about shmees sto. Love the car, hate the color
Hugh Jackman + Al Pacino
Why does the Huracan look like an aston martin from the front
TJ's mustang will never be able to go back. The entire factory unibody framework and suspensions have been hacked out and a frame replaced. Not to mention the RB engine...the most unreliable of jdm engines. If hed done a regular  mustang body nobody would care.
Schmee 🤮
Have you never seen Tokyo Drift mate? That's where that mustang with RB26 idea came from. But anyways, go on.
He was so classie with his roast I felt honored
some people don't like heavily modded cars and some people don't like goatees.
„Influencer“ is a word I hope we can stop using soon. What a waste of space these people are.
TJ's mustang is actually a regular mustang with a gt350 front bumper. its a replica
I find it hard to roast something I could never afford
the Huracan is the McDonald's Spec
Wait I thought TJs mustang wasn't a true GT350 I thought it was a clone
Drew peacock in 20 years
What’s the song in the background?
YouTuber: *does car stuff*  Hammond: "But whyyyyy?"
You really need to get to Florida and hang out with Cleetus McFarland at his Freedom Factory race track. You would have a blast.
He was far too nice to WhistlinDiesel. Far too nice.
Hahahahaha that donkey is just jealous because he could never dream about having those cars
Please roast more of Hoovie’s cars.
“Your eyes, function. They must do. But there’s evidence here to suggest they don’t.” 🤣
"350 zed" I know that this is how the english say it, but still weird
Am I the only one that hears a “mosquito pitch” in the background?? It’s a very sharp high pitch tone….and it bothers the living daylights.
Alternate title: Richard Hammond belittling people for having different opinions and preferences than him for cars that are not his
react to dde's 720gtr or the twin turbo f12, im rlly interested on how hammond would react to those pieces of art
Gentel Roasting
Whats your problem colletes paintjob is so nice nicer then your porche which got bittien by a nissan petrol bruhhh shame on you
You should get Hammond to look at Car Throttles/Alex's v6 MX-5 'Phil'
tax evasion money can't buy taste
Hammond if you see this what’s better Demon or a mustang
Shmee has become a garage queen
Saw collette 😂
Shmee specs is care awfully
Richard asks why would you paint it pink and put Barbie on the side..... It's an American kind of thing Richard you just wouldn't get it.    😂😂😂
Shmee got the booster juice car
Shmee's car is horrible
The huracan paint job is pretty sick
Hammond needs to sell more of his car collection in order to get an office lol, jk.
like a barbie car colour yes yes
Wasn’t tj mustang not an actual gt350?
Richards never seen Tokyo drift?
Check out the Smokestang by westen chaplin
I’ve never heard of these you tubers
Being a classic car lover I can only agree with Richard !
BMW's are gross.
You should look at ddes twin turbo f12
Shmee150s lamborghini looks awesome
Next time check Budda TV Nissan s13 the nuke 🥰
You want to see roasting  , head over to drewpeacock channel
to be fair tj's mustang was a replica gt500
How about the DDE cars
The sound mastering needs to be better.  I could hear the high pitch noise in the background the entire time. It was sort of what people with Tinnitus would hear!
i used to watch tj hunt, but it turned into "watch tj hunt use tons of money and not work on most of his cars himself"
Is it bad that I am glad to hear Richard roasting Whistlin Diesel for ruining another car.
Why the E61 engine is the most unreliable one? Can someone tell me, whats wrong with it?
I'm here because I heard whistlin diesel
When acting flabbergasted and stammering vague adjectives is interpreted as “roasting” 🥴
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, not what car program presenter finds of it!
Some cars and drivers need roasting! They ruin the look of their vehicle!
TJ Hunts Mustang WASN’T A GT350, it’s a regular GT with a GT350 body kit. If anything the person who put the kit on ruined the car, not TJ.
Yeah I love Shmee150s other specs but the STO, hmmm yeah I never digged the yellow/orange on it…same with his GT8. But it’s his car so whatevs.
James may is better at this
If im not mistaken the Shmee user / person is color blind like for real. An talked about this.
Wasted my life watching that! Absolute tosh!
I have no idea who these people are.
You need to take a roadkill vacation and go spend a few days with David and Steve I'd bet you have a bit of fun
Shmee100’s car colours match his dress sense. I imagine he wears socks with sandals.
Tokyo drift inspired mustang is 👌
Some pretty fair points made there, in particular regarding that abomination of Shmee's!
Worst idea ever, TJ has no taste for classic cars, unless this mustang had no engine when he bought it
Where is this world going? Hammond, the perfect gentleman, is roasting a girls car? Clarckson would never do that
Brown
If i may ask. Where is stradmans pink  Lamborghini?
Do the daily driven exotics fleet
Smart option for gas prices https://youtu.be/h6xFyVbEItY
props to shmee for doing something unique
His reaction on shmees STO is spot on! What a horrible thing to see 😱
Imagine if he saw Alex Choi Lamborghini 😂😂
Roasting TJ's RB26 Mustang without knowing it was a tribute to Tokyo Drift's triumphant RB26 Mustang. 🤷‍♂️
You're lucky Nico Rosberg's Rimac isn't ready yet...
That Mustang makes me violently frustrated
TJs Mustang isn’t a real GT350 lol.. it’s a “clone”
It's not to my taste personally but I do actually kind of like it when feminine girls who are into cars do girlie things with their cars?  No one takes female car enthusiasts seriously anyway so we might as well have fun with it
I wanna hear what he has to say about dde’s twin turbo f12
It’d be amazing if he could try to roast Adam Lz’s car collection  I wanna know what he’d say about it
Its not a original gt 350
This would be funnier if you did even the most basic of research. Like TJs car for example. Inspired off of a movie car, the Tokyo drift mustang, AND it’s not a real GT350, something that’s been covered SEVERAL times. Like come one, it’s 2022 there’s really no excuse for not being able to Google something that takes all of 20 seconds to find. Same issue I had with previous episodes of this. It’s not funny when you’re unironically flat out wrong.
So anything that isnt boring factory colors = bad. Okay
It's brown or as Jezza said on The Grand Tour "It's Baige"
😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😅
And at the end of the day... these "youtuber's" probably make more than Hammond. Lol
Gordon ramsay of cars
TJ’s mustang isn’t actually a GT350. It just has the livery.
No need to be a bit edgy
I have the idea TJ Hunt's Mustang wasn't really a GT350. It's just a livery the previous owner had put on. I believe he talked about it in one of his videos
Didn't whistling diesel break off his rear bumper and thatsvwhy its not on there? Also i think his R8 is a green but the petro stop's lighting made it look weird
hammond and may are both so funny but in very very different ways
Be a mate and post links to of each cars you are reviewing.
colletes car is sponsored by barbie
Totally agree with the comments on Shmee’s stuff. That’s an abomination. Like most of his car choices.
He should react to shmees zenvo tsrs when he gets it, purple and green 😬
I would love to see you roast the novice garage mustang (aka the great value Shelby)
it would be great if richard, james, and jeremy did a video with whistlen.
He should react to all the different cars in possession of JP Performance
The Lamborghini colors remind me of a dragonfruit
i dont like those racspotter dudes. they basicly got all that money from looking at other peoples cars thats quite lame, i know its from youtube views but stil. ha walks around real businessmen and what does he do? watch cars
Dreadful…everything.
I’m tj hunts defense it is not a real gt350 it is a replica one also singed by mr Shelby him self but u get the idea
You should look at Xavier fox's car collection! He has some amazing machines.
Huracan looking like a custard and rhubarb flavour lol
Can someone please explain..........was this supposed to be funny?
Roast dde twin turbo f12
I near dropped my tea laughing. Thanks for posting.
Richard probably hasnt seen Tokyo Drift to say that about the Mustang, or maybe he didnt make the connection that its a homage to the movie car.
Tj want to build exactly like Mustang in tokyo drift
I don’t think TJ’s gt350 was a real one. The person he bought it from put a kit on a normal fastback.
Please get Clarkson on this as well to roast some cars, we want to see his roasting as well
I think the previous owner of TJ’s mustang did a 350 swap on which is why he didn’t mind doing the Tokyo Drift RB build
It’s not brown it’s sunburst orange
Roast dde cars
tj hunts mustang wasn’t even a real gt350 😂😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 stop it,stop it shmee
Spectacular! 😂😂😂
I could not agree more with him 😂
I think he was too kind on Shmee LOL. The yellow parts he ruined the previously beautiful Lambo with will go down in history as one of the poorest automotive choices man has ever made.
BrOwN car
Still hasn't tackled the big boy.  Bring it. I wanna see his reaction to CaptainSparkles's Ford GT.
The 350Z coloring choice isn't even loud enough considering the company it keeps....
The RB26 Mustang is an idea taking from The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift where they did exactly the same thing after the police confiscated all of Hahn’s working vehicles and Left and derelict car that still had a working motor.  Still ridiculous, but without the extra weight, I will guess the handling is awesome.
Tj s wasn't a real gt 350 it was a body kit
Roasting needs work. But I guess this was honest roasting. If it were scripted than it would be deadly I guess. So I prefer this way actually now that I think about it.
RICE OUT EM CARS
So you mean Shmee had money but don't have taste😁
Would have to disagree on the rear bumper delete R8!!
The colours on Shmee's Huracan are great, but not together
to be fair TJ’s mustang wasn’t a GT350 it just had a body kit 😂
Another great content would be, cars and bikes that hammond crashed.
I'm so glad I'm not the only one who feels that way about TJ's Mustang, my man really should've left that one alone.
TJ Hunt’s mustang is actually a replica GT350 not a genuine GT350.
Richard why do you not agree with james on the sunday roast ? The ineos Grenader?
Hi where do I send my videos?
IT Was not real 350. IT Was regular Mustang that Was only gt350 looker.
Old mate Hammond here can't roast hehehe 😁😂🤣
I actually love Collete's Barbie 350z, cars are a reflection of the owner, you can tell a LOT about a person by their car, and Collete's car is a perfect reflection of it's owner. A lot of car enthusiasts tend to do exactly the same thing as another person that also owns the same car, and as a result, a lot of "builds" are extremely boring because all they are is a copy of someone else's originality. Even Hammond was roasting Whistlin Diesel for exactly the same thing, a twin turbo R8, how original, oh and you put one of the about 5 choices of wheels that everyone else puts on it, nice, and of course you left the bumper off like everyone else. Yes, it's an extremely fast and cool car, but it in no way expresses your personality. Granted, WhistlinDiesel has other vehicles that exemplify his personality so I think he gets a pass for this one.
The High pitched "Shmee" @ 02:07 got me hitting this timestamp for the 85th time in a row 🤣😭
Schmeeeeeee reminds me of a hairdresser trying to be a car journalist.
Already the first one, he doesn’t realise it’s basically the same car from Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift
as a  classic  car enthusiast Hammond's cars are plain old Vanilla - gets boring after a while
Don't roast me if there is something but why don't they react to cars from DDE
Would love to see him roast demo ranches cuda when it's done. That would be funny
we need ricer miata and tommy
TJ bought a used “fake” GT350 to do the Skyline engine mod. It was not originally produced as a GT350.
i think there's nothing wrong in shmee STO
Btw the fans chose the colors for the Shmee's STO !
Ti’s mustang was a fake gt… that’s one of the reasons he chose that car to put in the rb26.
You know you are old if the young guy from top gear is old now. GDI
Feature the V8 tesla by rich rebuilds
Richard never seen tokyo drift then lol
I swear Shmee is color blind
Mustangs are most liked for their great mod potential. But putting a straight six in a Mustang, a GT350 nonetheless,  is absolutely criminal...
You’re in luck. TJ’s mustang wasn’t a real GT350 to begin with, which is why he bought it.
To be fair shmee’s huracan yellow accent is just a wrap, in the original black and sort of darker pink it’s not that bad
DDE's McLaren 720 GTR would be a great one to look at
I think he is just old and out dated as people are evolving and impressed with they're builds no matter what anyone else thinks, which is the main thing.
I wonder what he would have thought of the smoke stang lol
Simply amazing
wow he dissed a sto, my dream car. How dare you! jk but the colours not nice
TJ Hunts RB26 Mustang wasn’t a true GT350!
Shmee and Collete sharing the same spec on their cars 😂
"Are your eyes functional or is your brain bit not working?" Quite the polite way to say someone's crazy
Drivetribe = car not working Dde = cars not working Elliminate = cars not working  Are any YouTuber cars working?
Finally,he did something I wanted to do for a long time 😂
that first one, its only having engine problems because its from a Nissan
Roast a 1994 nissan pick bought in Dallas Texas, thst sat in my father's backyard for more than 10 years.... runs find except hard wired headlight and a brand new trasmission.... it's also hauled almost 2000 lbs, (ok closer to 1500 literal pounds of flooring), with inverted leaf springs, and almost "flat tires". No damage other than "Oh my poor truck"
Thank you for finally being the person to tell shmee that his tastes in how he specs cars is the worst! Well him and the sradman are I think equally brain dead when it comes to that with cars
Tj's mustang has a gt350 kit but its not actually one
Tj's mustang is
1st car. he wanted to recreate the mustang from fast and furious Tokyo drift.
Before anyone is allowed to buy a classic car, there needs to be some kind of formal test to determine if they suffer from color blindness or a complete failure of style and taste. Because clearly, several of the car owners reviewed herein should not be allowed to purchase a kid's pedal car, far less a nice piece of kit.
afaik the rb mustangs overheating was fixed. It's supposedly pretty drivable.
Viola Bast is stunning, ruined by the yellow 😅
🤣🤣
should put adam lzs r34 in an episode
TJ hunts Mustang was not a gt 350, it was a replica with a knackered Windsor engine, car now sports an Art Morrison chassis and a very well built rb26
what's happened to drew peacock?
TJ's Mustang wasn't the real GT350. It was a restomod.
The Mustang "GT350" was a replica
who ruins an original gt350?
Hammond doesn’t have a mean bone in his body…. I cringed watching him try to be something he’s not.  Still enjoyed the video
TJ’s car was not an original GT350.
Unreal 😅
Crash any exotic cars off cliffs lately?
As the saying goes.... just because you huraCAN... doesn't mean you huraSHOULD....r.i.p lambo
Bruh he made the Tokyo drift mustang
It wasn't a real gt350, it was a tribute so if anything he improved that mustang.
SHMEE CAN NOT CONFIGURE A CAR 👎👎👎👎👎
Strange that the Nissan and the Lambo have similar colour paint jobs - only shmee didnt get Barbie painted on his.
not sure about the paint job on his head
are you going to start that boattail Buick or not?
TJ's mustang is 350 clone. Not a real one he even said that he wouldn't have touched if it was real
as a gt350 owner, the first one was painful
Support Ukraine: https://opensea.io/Vitalionoff
But it's shmeeeeeeeeeee you must loooook at meeeeeeeeeeeee
plz do more of this .. trully funny
Sorry but most ate nicer than your cars. Tj mustang is a recreation of Tokyo drift car thays why. Plus they are yoytubers gotta do crazy stuff paint wraps etc. I love whistlin diesels audi not the color so much but looks way Better without the bumper
that shmee guy, who I’m sure doesn’t own the cars he drives, has such a hideous taste
TJ Hunts mustang was a recreation of a GT 350. It never was a real GT 350.
Next a car of the stradman or DDE please. The have a lot of cars 😅
Not a real GT350
Painful to hear this guy's roasting skills, where is Andrew Schulz when you need him.
Shmees paint job 🤢
Money doesn't can't buy taste... You could do a thousand episodes like this lol
Has he done Tjs huracan? (Now whistling diesels)
Tj’s mustang was a replica gt350. Not authentic
I love shmees car colors.
You call this roasting??  I mean it's great for 70 plus on a Sunday afternoon
Bit unfair on Tim shmeee when his build was intended to be a wild out there spec. Is this what Hammond is down to thought he was doing a smallest cog. These influencers as you call them make clips worthy of Top gear in quality.
Your taste says you are old, ow wait you are old, my mistake🤣
don't quote me on this but I think TJ said that, the gt350 is a fake one and not a original     Also did Mr. Hammond ever hear of the movie called Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift? If yes then he would see why TJ did the swap
do a full adam lz car fleet roast
the problem with the S85 in DTs E61... is that BMW at the time of the E60/E61... was in Formula 1... and they for some reason made the HORRIFIC choice... to put F1 technology... into their road cars.. BUT... thats a fair trade off because these engines are among the best sounding BMW engines to date..
So great hamster.
He actually said Shmee in the same high pitched voice than Shmee talks himself when introducing a video :D
Shmee taste is horrible the yellow doesn’t work at all 🤮
Tj Hunts mustang wasn’t a real gt-350
Trash take hamster.
Pretty much just judging peoples own opinions, everything people try to avoid in the car community
TJ Hunt is obviously an FF Tokyo Drift fan.
The Huaracan STO only comes in awful colorways
British Al Pacino vibes I’m getting
is this supposed to be funny?
he clearly hasn’t watched Tokyo drift if he doesn’t appreciate tj’s build
Tj hunt’s wasn’t a real Shelby though
Im nice man then suddenly pulled out mini gun and roasted all of em
Whistlin Diesel defo overreacted
Tjs mustang wasn’t a real gt350
it wasn’t a real gt350 it was a tribute if it was real i don’t think he would’ve swapped it
You should have DDE and Alex Choi if there is another one. Those dudes have crazy Sh8
🤣🤣 with Shmee 150, you are absolutely right.  At times I wonder why he does what he do. So disrespectful to the brand. Let's say that he is  "UNIQUE "
Far too nice.. it’s not a roast, it’s a very light toast at best.
Can we get Shmee and Richard in one shoot?
Lol we like shmee but that huracan mmm
roast stradman pls just for the fun
Wish you included B is for Builds r69 His gtr r34 body put onto a crashed r35 making it a leagal r34 in America
when Shmee first rolled up in his Lambro I was expecting Katie Price to be behind the wheel,it looks like a Barbie car,horrible!
Shmee has the shittest taste
The Hamster is aging pretty well if you ask me, but the teeth are still suspiciously white…
Shmee's lambo does look hideous!
TJ Hunt want make a replica of fast furious tokyo drift car on the final scene when swan versus dk.
I’d like to think that somewhere there’s a fashion blog roasting Richard Hammond’s tragic sartorial efforts. Boot cuts, beads, blazers!
thank goodness someone called out Shmee. the bloke has awful taste. and the sto proves it by a mile.
problem is, no one from uk as something to say about other cars, everyone but superficial people agrees that uk cars are the worst on this planet
it would be so funny to also see Jeremy doing this kind of video
He looks like he got roasted himself. His chest is all red lol.
Never thought he'd be better at this than May but there you are!
Please roast TheStradman
Still no FAZE CLAN GTR ROAST
You should have included Stradman's pink & white Aventador roadster
Why do people do these things. Because most of us aren't born before 1962...
Likely very few people remember when this clown DJ started off on a cable TV show about modified cars. He literally did not know the difference between an intercooler and a throttle body!
Th hunts mustang is not a gt350 it’s a gt badged as a 350 then converted to a movie replica
If that is how he reacts to those cars I really wanna see what he is gonna think when he sees DDE cars if the actually put them in a video.
That mustang is unreal. Shut up Hammond
Shmees Hurracan looks like a fruit salad sweet 😂🤮
Tj Hurts Mustang was not a gt350… just badged as one… he says that I the first video of it and a few after.
A lot of words for a man that crashes every car he’s ever driven
the 350 z cool asf and if she did a pearl sea side blue with white work emotions and the interior all black with light blue stitching and on the roof i would have a artist do pin-striping like on the old-school low riders 🔥
Shmee's is the best one of all ❤️
The Mustang is perfect. Would love to do that to every 60s muscle car. Most of them look quite nice. But those engines 🤢🤢🤢. Any modern straight 6 would suite them. Be it Nissan, toyota, bmw or why not an om606 with modified pump and a big turbo 😁👍
This roast better be a joke yo
Rb26 is way better than the Secretary's v8 engine . Prfft
Sometimes, at around 8pm of a Sunday evening, I will hear a faint voice say "TONIGHT......!"
Let's have Kaleb Roasting farm vehicles
i love that the topgear guys will do this, but the car youtubers wont
That sto is super nice your crazy
Tj Hunts mustang review was the most pathetically ignorant thing I have ever heard. Really knocking Tokyo Drift’s fan favorite car? Dumb af
You have to see the cars of one of the Polish Youtubers, Budda TV, he has a Nissan S13 in full kevlar body kit, a BMW E6.3 AMG and he cut a new Aventador and put on a Liberty Walk body kit
Glass houses etc. Tory boy Hammond should pipe tf down, look at the state of him.
Tj should be arrested for doing that to a mustang
Spineless roast.
Basically to Shmee: “Stop it, get some help”.
Finally someone firing on shmee on his specs
Some of these cars looks like they escaped from a freddy Kruger movie
Hammond has obviously NOOOOOOO idea on why youtubers pick their colour schemes and mods
Claims to know Collete:  *Proceeds to say she definitely doesn't like the bright pink and neon yellow*  Clearly doesn't know Collete 😂
Based
2:36 Its like they combined all the girl Power Rangers. No, that isnt a roast, its a Power Ranger harem in Passionate uhhh, slightly Italian, car form.
Complaining about JDM engine swapping American muscle cars is the dumbest thing I've ever seen. You guys don't bat an eyelash at LS swapping every JDM car in existence, but when someone  does the opposite it's everyone up in arms. Kinda annoying.
TJs MUSTANG WANS NOT A GT350. it just had that paint job. he even said it himself.... watch the original video where he explains that. you ALSO did not mention that this is a tribute build to the tokyo drift mustang where it has the same setup
wasn't tj's mustang a gt350 clone
to be fair tjs GT 350 is a replica, not the real thing
Hammond always was my favourite on top gear. Seems like a downt to earth bloke
Some say he the secret American agent.
When TJ Hunts car isn’t even a GT350 😅
I believe the Huracan colors were largely influenced by Shmee's girlfriend, coz according to her Instagram, she's the "chief vehicle spec officer".
WHERE IS PART 2 OF HAMMOND STARTING THE RIVIERA
Shmee is 12 yrs old?
Brilliant.
That was definitely a gentle roast. I'm afraid you won't ever see what you'd consider "proper" from an influencer.  But I give great respect to those using their cars for a track purpose.  All my sport bikes barely had street time.  It's difficult for me to see tricked out and lowered sport bikes.
Hiiii
Maybe TJ Hunt wanted a drift mustang like initial D. Tho I do agree, should have left the original.
Hammond think those are bad? check out the guy on youtube with a honda powered 308.
I'll keep my 289 v8 in my 1967 mustang. Dont worry Hammond
haven't seen any dde cars on these. like the twin turbo f12
TJ Hunts mustang wasnt actually a shelby, it was only a rep kit TJ said that himself lol
LOL, from the thumbnail i though he was a mashup between ironman and Al Pacino XD
Richard, check out DDE daily driven exotics. You'll be able to spend days and days  roosting these guys😂😂
now I really want to see.a video of Richard roasting all of the mightycarmods cars, and then Marty and Moogs reaction, that would be hilarious
next time please JP Performace :)
Ok i like mustangs too they have always been my favourite cars but come on mate, you cant deny the harmony and sheer wildness of this american-japanse horse.
I love Hammond but mate the rb26 mustang is a bad man ting he's off his rocker 😂
Cool
hammond is gonna be happy when he finds out that tj hunts mustang was a replica 😂😂😂
Lol tj hunt was thinking oh they did it in tokyo drift so ill do it too
The most british roast evrr!!!
You trying to roast TJ Hunt car failed terribly if you actually watch his videos the original owner clearly states it's not a real gt350 if you're going to try and roast a YouTuber do the research
Hammon... That gorgeous Pepsi GMT on your wrist made me almost attracted to you for a bit... Which is kinda weird because I'm a bloke, but you seem to have a proper taste when it comes to classic Rolex models.
TJ's mustang isn't a real gt350 it's a clone
Whistlindiesels rage brought me here
And imagine if Jeremy or James did this.
5:05 its like showing off hemorrhoids
That jacket and vest though!!! Baller!!
E36 and E46 owners be spending thousands on parts before fixing their window regulators totally not guilty
Please tell me none of you have been jabbed. You're gonna die if you have.
Oh no... you roasted Whistlin. Better be careful, he'll come and run your shop over with a backhoe or something. Probably destroy one of your collector cars just for the fun of it. And then he'll go and buy a Porsche just to tick off the haters.
Looks as if someone has been roasting young Richard.  He's almost as pink as the Barbie car.
I would love to see a breaking Richard Hammonds car and not replacing it collab from whistlin diesel and Hammond
Kinda surprised whistlins R8 made it and not monster max. Hammond being the American he is, would’ve loved it.
TJs mustang wasn't a GT350
I’m a WD fan but let’s be honest he’s being a baby about a little roast
he know whistlin diesel? when he said he was a "modest quiet chap" I was "whut?" have he seen his truck? lol
Why no Lotus?????
Love the fact he’s roasted  Shmee 150 because he’s been ruining cars for years with his terrible colour selection.
I only like stock cars or slightly modified
2:28 Isn't it a Lambo thing to be flashy and over-the-top? I think it fits.
What about Whistlin's nee twin turbo huracan he just bought from TJ hunt?
Shmee...just stop it
View triple f collection cars
Should’ve shown Hammond Monster Max, his reaction would probably be hilarious.
Never thought I would have seen the  former Stig on Richard's video. What a legend.
Hahaha tj made the Tokyo drift mustang lol
Shmee paints all his cars horribly I don’t understand what his reasoning is but what ever it is, it just plain wrong.
no need to criticize peoples cars let people do to there cars what they like
If he thought Shmees Huracan STO was bad wait till he sees his zenvo tsr-s
Don’t worry, it’s not a real GT350
:-)
I LOVE the TJ Hunt mustang, but I also agree with you.    Having it as a real gt350 didn't add anything to this build. He could have and would have achieved this look and goal had he just used a fastback gt. No need to hack up a real gt350.   Still super interesting though.
Shmee's taste is as awful as his videos.
the roasted man is roasting
Love how he tells the owners how to change the cars to his taste, even tough its not his
check out the Hilux videos that Whistlin Diesel made. a little bit of a classic Top Gear throwback
I thought the Huracan was a Vulcan
Shmee has the worse colours
That rb26 mustang is a masterpiece actually infact my dream build
If you haré that Pink car Richard, don't look at Claudia fijal's 911 Carrera 🤦‍♀️
I stopped watching Shmee's videos because of that STO.
Do they really improvise this or some of it is written beforehand?
There must be something wrong with me, after seeing Richard's reaction to the STO and reading a lot of comments, I honestly don't think it's that bad.
Someone forgot to sound balance this thing. Why is Richard whispering ? Unwatchable.
Loved this
Next video: Hammond roasting Mr. JWW's cars
Don't know how he's got the front to roast anyone or anything with that amount of hair dye desperately clinging to his face and head 😂😂
“Mr Diesel” 😂
The Mustang of TJ is not a gt350, it's only the cosmetic bits, and it had a random crate motor in it, it has much more soul now tbh.  Love the Lamborghini reaction 😂
Richard “imagine being Mexican” Hammond
hope all diss liked tis old man
Some one must do B is for Builds Jumpacan.
Add DDE cars also
Whistlin Diesel is dead to me after seeing how he treats his poor poor cars. He's not a car guy
I agree with Hamster here. Shmee’s STO is hideous.
I truly expected to see the cars that @M539Restorations have done in this video. Restored by himself and using right now. Next time add them please.
Sadly most people don't get brand new cars given to them. Watch Stuart Lee and top gear.........perfect
Collette literally has the worst taste when it comes to cars. I think its her eyes that aren't working
Shmee is definately the most annoying car Youtuber by far 🙉
I hope he realizes that tj hunt did the right thing with the mustang, whistlin did something with an r8 he could never lol, the turbo fabrication work is something he could never admire cause he’s more worried about color and comfortability of a car🤦🏻‍♂️
😂why did she right barbie on her car and he roasted her about it
Lol what i wonder what will be his reaction when he sees THE DDE TWIN TURBO F12 😂
😂😂😂
I actually like the Lambo...
1st one he's just jelly cause they don't have those stangs in the UK 🤣
V Well that V10 BMW at the end... Discusting. Takes Drivetribe coolnes back to nah.
Richard Hammond seems every down to earth.
Why does this video have ‘Just for Men’ in the advertising? 🤔  😂🤣
It's funny to me how car people, send a pic of their car for people to roast. Car drivers ask you to roast a car they're standing in front of.
Do some of the stradmans collection
Bro whistling diesel is salty on his insta lol
Richard you are literally killing us for not knowing that the origin of TJ Hunts Mustang was from Fast & Furious Tokyo Drift, it's the Hero car man!   Your staff should be slapped for not informing you of this as well! Can you even call yourselves car guys for not knowing this?  Redeaming yourself with the Shmee bit though...even Lambo wouldn't commit to this one, Tim put the yellow bits on after in vinyl.
Would love to see more of this
TJ's Mustang isn't/wasn't a real gt350.  The previous owner painted/striped it that way and TJ needs to change it up..
Collette Davis, and Tim Shmee have very similar colors taste 🤣
judging cars on how there painted or wrapped lol
He should roast monster max II
Wonder what Hammond would think of the demo ranchtang
Wondering if they will review the dde cars one day.
TJ Hunt's GT350 is a fake.
[referring to the widebody twin turbo Audi R8 with no rear bumper]  “I see you’ve de-badged it because you’re a modest, quiet chap.”  😂
Colette's Barbie car ain't nothing you  just wait till you see the Corvette drift car  she's doing is done
A has been roasting cars of people with more followers to stay relevant.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣i'm dying
WD punching air rn literally
One of the greatest driver)
I give Shmee a pass for the STO because he's such a jolly fellow, the rest of these cars are pure trash/sacrilege (Mike's BMW TBD haha).
A little man, with a face mullet, and the money to buy anything he wants, making fun of other people. How is this entertainment?
Can't even put the ' in the right spot 😂😂
It's insane to me, yeah, Hammond's roast of whistling diesels car wasn't that great, he had somehow it's really agitated whistling diesel like come on man. Man, you spend your whole career making fun of haters but just can't like take slight criticism?
Nothing better than listening to old men complain about custom cars. “You did what you wanted with your own car, you idiot!”
Still need him to react to Jordan Marons ford gt
Smols Roasts from a Smol Man
a gentle roasting must just mean asking people to stop
I find it really funny that WD is salty over this
Whistlindiesel took this moderate roast to heart
Shmee's Lambo. Somebody had to say it.
https://youtu.be/mS8SwFaNVJE
Needed to bring Adam LZs r34 on
if richard hammond saw my roll cage huracan, he’d have a seizure
Brilliant!!! Nail on the head!!
Should have. Thrown Streetspeed717's corvette zr1
Who Who Who Who Who?
I was smilling from ear to ear the whole time
lol WhistlinDiesel is so angry, Small baby man
………………………………………..
Whistlin Diesel's feelings were hurt😂
It was too gentle, give us some proper stuff :D
@whistlindiesel         is another IM RICH AND I BUY NOT BUILD!!! T.J. HUNT Is a verry smart entrepreneur, his girl? SMART N CUTE  🙌🏽  But Special .Adam LZ is SIMPLY SPOILED   And his Lady Godbless her Is ...unique as well...oh shmeeee just stay on that side ,Mr I wear and say the same exact thing,like friggen groundhog day...🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️BOUGHT NOT BUILT!!!
WE NEED TO SEE HAMMOND NEXT TO MONSTERMAX!!!
Always love a Hammond video.
Richard !!  make a video on  the most horrible engine put in production car !!
Seems like he never watched Tokyo Drift. Very disappointing.
Hammond? You sit there, looking like that and attempt to roast others? Go home mate 😂🙈
Rob Dahm 4 rotor?
Whistlindiesil ain't gonna be happy 😳
I prefer May.  He is funnier and the comments are more natural, and better argumented.
You missed the part where roasts are meant to be funny… this is lame
I agree with him on that mustang. Come on man, an RB Inna mustang 😖
Funny
Tj's mustang is a replica gt350
WhistlinDiesel is not happy about flaming his car
💤💤💤💤
Based on his reaction to that Mustang someone should show Hammond Mike Finnegan's cars. A 55 Chevy with a Hemi in it and a '68 Charger powered by a 2JZ
agreed the yellow should be removed from the STO
A Huracan STO in pink and yellow and a 350Z in pink and yellow. The real question here is, will Shmee put a Barbie sticker on the doors?
The big boys showing everybody how it’s gotta be
whistlindiesel the narcissists he is got triggered by this 😂
why is there never dde cars and whay is thestardman's LB-Works Aventador not in here
And that is a connoisseur talking (roasting) about cars properly!!
Great video although I am gonna stick up for Shmee’s Huracan. Yes it is rather loud and out there spec but I think it really suits, the yellow goes nicely with the pink imo and remember, it’s not permanent, it’s just PPF, he didn’t actually paint it that colour.
it wasnt a gt350....just had stickers
TJ's Mustang wasn't a real GT 350, it was a replica so it isn't as bad as you thought.
Spot on with the mustang. … 🤦🏻
Hammond is such a has been
Cmon Richard, that Mustang is from Tokyo Drift, he did it on purpose.
Shmee does some of the worst job speccing cars I’ve ever seen.
TJ’s GT350 was never a GT350. It just had a graphics kit on it
tjs car wasnt a gt 350
Shmee150 huracan reminds me of Aston Martin vulcan
Shout out Whistlin Diesel
Shmee bought a Zenvo = so he is a legend.  He is allowed to do whatever he wants to a baby Lamborghini 😎
Everything wrong with a V10 M5 can be found between the front and rear license plate.
Having no bumper to show turbos and titanium pipes that look amazing is completly different than everyone being able to see your intestines 💀
Who is here cause they saw whistlindiesels r8 lol
This guy really doesnt know what he's talking about
Has anyone else not heard of these people
@whistlindiesel  lol 😂
I wish there was a dislike number count
Shmee and Collete have similar tastes.
This dude knows nothing about cars
horrible audio. Vacuum running in the background?
has he never seen tokyo drift? that stang is perfect
Shmees STO would be nice without the yellow accents
spyros panopoulos products any verdict on the 1750hp hydrogen Zion? China has order book open for it. And leave schmee the Lambo STO is a weapon, and Lambo is adopting next gen tech, for never seen before powers.
Hammond is the Wikipedia of cars
that Mustang would be awesome if it had been a straight 6 or even a base v8, but a GT350 why😢...
TJs mustang is a reference to tokyo drift.
I'd advise you to call it a "reaction" or a "comment". Because when people see "smb... roast... smth" they expect rude things. Sorry for my English, it's not my native language.
Ha ha ha,gypsies ha......"That's what he is.......nothing "
New Subscriber 🍿
Mike said the Mondeo was mint 😃
Shmee STO looks like a car my 10yr old niece would make in rocket league
these car roasts are too funny 💀
5:00 Tell That Little Youth Hammond!
Shmee specs all his cars terribly 🤣 this is no surprise
Thoughts on DDE cgt
I’m so glad I’m not the only one that hates shmee’s huracan, the Colours are a prime example of money doesn’t buy taste
💯💯🤣🤣🤣🙏
i was hoping to see someone in video in comments....
Tj’s GT350 was a replica
That Lambo is a Shmes
hahahahah best roasting...needed to mention that Shmee150 loves the ugliness of a body kit hahahahah when I hear Mansory from his mouth on his videos, I pray so he can give up the idea hahahahaha
Покажите ему кто-то Бентли ультратанк
That 'Rhubarb & Custard' Lambo is hideous ....
Hammond : I wont roast  Also Hammond : Roasts everyone of them
When Hammond can't even drive like Collete 😭😂🤣
I've just heard Jez shouting from Chipping Norton "IT ISN'T BROWN!"
Poor mustang
DRIVETRIBE Can we have a whole video on Richard Hammond roasting Adam LZ car collection ?
Maybe he should learn more about the cars before trying to roast them. 🤔  For starters, TJs gt350 wasn't a real one just turned into one. Before TJ got it and now has no overheating issues. Just saying!
5:35 Working at BBC made Hammond forget that sponsorships exist
Absolutely loved his reaction to shmee150's car, its horrendous
This is how you know Hammond doesn't give a f*ck about YouTube(ers)
Great roast BUT when referring to the alternative to Ben Collins Turbo, don't you mean the 991.2 or 992 (not 997 Gen 2)?? Is the old brain-box playing up these days? If so, I know the feeling 😁
Have you had your teeth done again?
It’s because people were calling her the drift Barbie!
Most comments on the STO spec were “don’t do it “. He did it anyway so it was no mistake. 😆
00:10 What needs to be promoted?
That mustang is a copy from Tokyo drift.
These are all horrendous. Most of the "YouTubers" that are so call car guys only do this nonsense for clicks and their vehicles are always trashed out pretty quick lol
The One Guy That's "Hated" on Whistlin Diesel that Whistlin Can't Say "it's Because You Can't Afford it"   Note - I still Feel Whistlin Will Have the Last Laugh, Maybe he already did @Hilux
I 100% agree with every single word he said.
BROWN
Tjs is not a real GT350
Two words, you’re old, unsubscribe 🙃
This is the lamest roast ever. Please stop self-roasting with this sous vide
Can't believe you haven't show any car of JUCA, one of the biggest youtubers with amazing and exotic cars, really.
U need to look at JP Performance Cars
So, first day on this channel and Richard is litterally roasting cars, and the slow one basically just called me a pervert because I drive a GTI?!? I guess :V
If it’s any consolation, TJs Mustang wasn’t a gt350, it was a base model kitted out to look like one.
Where are the DDE cars?
so if its modified you bag it if its stock you like it, someone who put time money thought blood sweat and tears into there car or someone that walks into a dealer and goes "i want that one"  unmodified cars are boring be different think out side the box
0:30 I don't think he has seen tokyo drift
Shmee’s Lamborghini looks a lot better in person and that picture makes it look horrible
*I think if your a YouTuber you should be very privileged to end up on this list roast mine next* 🤣
Nothing can beat a hamster roasting people’s ricers.
Beautiful reaction to Shmee…he has the worst taste in specs…Bar none!…Made HORRIBLE 😂😂🤣
It wasn't a real gt350 lol, guy he bought it from upbadged it
Hey, perhaps the 350Z has Mattel sponsorship in which case all power to her. Anyway, it's a cheap old car available in large numbers, so as far as I'm concerned she can paint it up how it amuses her to. At least paint is removable and the lettering will be vinyl anyway. As for the Huracan, I hope that's a wrap, in which case half a day with a heat gun and it's cured of its terrible affliction.
First car is a tribute to the Mustang in Tokyo drift.
I had hoped that TJ Hunt's channel had died along with his taste, I see that is not the case and he's up to his antics. What a shame to do that to such an automotive legend. Hopefully he is carjacked (which is likely if he still lives in LA) and the crook is a respectable gentleman who will put the engine back in before selling it in the underground market.
Well if it's brown we know it's bad no matter what it has.
Non-gentle roasting by Clarkson would be entertaining
Hello M. Hammond can you make a video reacting to whistlin diesel video.
There's a lot of "supposed to be's" in this. It's a bit annoying actually.
what about stradman's pirelli aventador roadster?
The yellow accents on the front of the STO makes it look like it has Hulk Hogan’s mustache. It’s a really poor spec.
TJ’s mustang is not a real shelby, the previous owner just got the body parts for it. Just a regular ‘65 fastback
TJ's Mustang was not a GT350, it just looked like one
I would love to see you and the boys head to Florida and do a day with the boostedboiz!
TJs mustang wasn't a matching numbers car and didn't have the engine the 350 came with, that's the only reason he did this.
Should've reacted to BlackPanthaa's R34 Skyline
Tj mustang gt350 was a fake gt350
Richard Hammond roasting whistlindiesel is not something that?I knew I wanted however it was apparently something I desperately needed 😂
Please roast my car 😁🙌🏼
BMW, the car driven by the absolute worst and most arrogant drivers on the road.
Not going to lie I clicked on the video because I saw Shmee150 in the thumbnail. Then I got a awesome surprise when Mat Armstrong's M3 popped on the screen! 🔥Awesome car and I agree with Hammond, Mat did a great job on it 👏
The Worst.Spec STO! 😂😂
You've GOT to come up with new video ideas guys. No one even knows who these youtubers are, and no one cares what cars they have
Do DDE 720GTR and Twin turbo Ferrari V12 I want to see your reaction 😂😂😂 !?
He should be called tj cxxt
The rear bumper came of at 200 MPH  and run out of salt lake , you could watch some one else go fast and not wreak the whole thing
Tj's mustang is a gt350 replica isn't even on the original chassis it's his version of the Tokyo drift mustang he also building the veilside rx7.
hopefully some one told him that the rb swapped mustang was based of off a film. actually I wish he did so he could've roasted it better
5:02 expect to be in a video or a few Instagram posts 😂😂
TJ’s mustang isn’t a real GT350, just a regular old Mustang Fastback.
Shmee has no taste lol
I want to see Jeremy Clarkson roasting😃
Waiting for WhistlinDiesels response!  Haha
If Shmee’s car seems to be the worst …. That’s bad for someone who is living in between super and hypercars. You would expect the pinnacle of style, looks and performance.
look at JP Performance cars
do Kyle from boosted boiz honda minivan next :D
Ahh no way whistling diesel should do a hole video roasting everyone of your car imagine the views he will get. He thrives of the online haters. Hammond mite not be a hater but i would love to a reaction from whistling diesel 😂
Can you do this in an Australian accent 😁😂
Shmee150 likes bright colours on all his cars what’s wrong with that. Your just jealous
love the rhubarb and custard paint job on the lambo hahaha
The Wonder Trio should roast tiktokers cars.
We need clarkson in next roasting video
I swear Shmee has an odd taste in colours...he was completely shocked when STG told him in a podcast once 😂
At least they haven't had to sell theirs
the reaction to the STO was unfair, people have different styles and we cant agree on everything, I love the spec
Shmee needs to stop the LSD
Extremely precise about the shitme Huracan
Can we see this with the 3 of you guys please? I think it would be an awesome idea.
hahaha thats the first time someone doesn't roast a car from mat armstrong
Tj's mustang is actually a gt350 replica
would love to see hammond go to the shmuseum and roast the rest of shmees cars in person. 😂😂
I love how he didn't even notice the heart wheels on the 350
"You have eyes that work" 🤣
Poor old Shmee did his best with the almost-but-not-really, half-arsed attempt at a "privet" number plate. More "Xiaomi" than "Shmee", but, you know. 4/10.
TJs Mustang is a clone GT350. He bought it that way. He didn't ruin a real one.
when shmee see you going to get a Will Smith (he is very famous for hitting people)
He is the Gordon Ramsay of Cars
Someone who talks common sense for a change.
The coolest of the Top Gear trio.
That roast was so gentle that I thought he was James may
I thought drivetribe bit the dust…?
I wonder what hammond thinks of the mustsng mach e
Some of those were to polite
Strangely enough I agree with everything he had to say!
I am not gonna lie I really like the pink and yellow Lamborghini :P
Influencers lolz
... shmee paying a compliment to collete davis' nissan by copying the nissan's paint scheme? lol
Surely TJ is "Tokyo Drift" Lover 😉😉😉
Now I want to see the trio roasting YouTubers' cars.
1:40 Hammond being nice about EfourtyShit... its not right.
0:36 looks like Hammond hasn’t watched Tokyo Drift 😂
Influencer I hate that term who exactly are they influencing and the cars they own well most of them are out of reach of most people so in turn makes them out of touch
imagine thinking TJ's mustang was a GT350 when it's just a basic stang with 350 stickers.
Pity you cant get your facts right.   TJ Hunt's GT350 is a replica. originally had a 6 cylinder motor.  It did come with a v8, but definitly, NOT a real GT350
Looks like Richard doesn't like bright pink cars??? So I wonder what he thinks of Lee Collections Hot Pink Carrera GT https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wisbQpIsjkI&t=426s
@Hammond Is he sure the engine light is working? https://youtu.be/_7QWE2wDLLI
Richard is the BEST!!!
Did Hammond not get that the GT350 was referencing the F&F film?
I pressed the like button on this video without even watching it yet. That’s how much I love and miss watching you Richard and the trio. Well said Hammond!👍 btw agree, that Mustang and Audi R8 is just a dart to the publics face. I get adding the turbos for the R8 sure but not the removal of the body panels.
Smee150 obviously just took his inspiration from hubnut's multipla
5mug150 is a t0553r.
Roasting our cars? How about we roast Brain Reaction 🤣
Are they gonna do any more grand tour?  Goodbye.
Roast? That was to roasting what gently warming bread rolls was to cooking a beef joint on a Sunday.
Where is stradman
zero funny
SHMEEEEE the 🤡 - hasn’t a clue - and it’s about time people called him out for his hideously spec’d STO - and in Hammond’s words it’s - “APPALLING & HORRIBLE”.  I’d add 🐶 💩 to that also.
Disagree about the Mustang /RB26. How often do American V8s get put in all sorts of cars and we all just love it. Do something different, like that, and he gets roasted? What about when you put a rotary in a Beetle or a Tesla motor in a classic Porsche? Nah,  Hamster is wrong about that one, still, love your work🖒
Tj’s mustang was a fake gt350
i love how he said "TJ...." like a dissapointed teacher
I send Shmee replies that he should hire an Atelier to help him with specs, no replies of course.
little does he know Whistlin diesel literally took  a hammer to the bumper after he accidentally hit a fox
People pick these ridiculous color combinations in an attempt to make a one of one. I know of several people that did that with their C8. They actually think that a base model with hideous color combinations will be worth a lot of money one day. Chevy will eventually make 100s of thousands of them.
Did you notice the Heart-shaped rimms in a Yellow Lime color in 5:34?
@shmee did ruin his car and made a perfectly wonderful car horrid
I don’t watch tj hunt is his mustang a real gt 350 or just painted like one
Ooohhh👀‼ Can't wait to see the reactions from the roasted You Tubers🤣👍‼
Shmee's lambo looks like a burnt toast with a piece of cheese on it and a huge topping of jam
TJ did the rb26 swap in the mustang as a tribute to the rb26 mustang in fast and furious Tokyo drift
Disguised as a plug for TSC 🥴
I wanna see how you roast the DDE twin turbo f12🤣🤣
Love you Hammond
You really can’t put a bumper on a TwinTurbo r8 Because the pipes are sticking out more than you think
Love that sharp Hammond wit.
Man I would’ve loved if they put one of Will Smiths cars and he said “…pass”
Why dont you review daily driven exotics cars
When you roast other youtubers cars but can't roast   Your channels car because your the one who built it🤣
shmee's STO looks like it was spec'd by a small child
911: 991.2 not 997.2... was when they went turbo through the range
This channel really gave me insight into what Hammond was talking about in the newest GT special. As a Canadian who lives in a very rural area, you would never be able to keep a car, let's be honest, an SUV or probably a truck that clean.
6:09 - 6:13  Why did Hammond rub his nose-picking into his forehead?
Thank you...for / first car tj hunt..Mustang...I did leave a comment . On original video..of this ...if u do that 4.0...Barra if u / have to......you forgot Emilia Hartford..MUSTANG..with its injector Hat/ on twin carburetor's....
Richard Hammond twenty years ago: Supercars are supposed to be bonkers and insane!  Richard Hammond today: ... what did you DO to that poor Lambo?
Hammond's daft red hair dye matches Schmee's daft Huracan!    Wonder when he'll realise that the colour makes him look ten years older than the bedraggled, au naturel May?
I'm addicted to the trio🥰🥰🥰
If you re-engine a car, Ford have Ford engines, Hondas have Honda engines ...simple!
Jesse, he kinda looks like Robert Downey Jr. My Roomate mentioned it cause he's never seen hammond before. He's not wrong 😩
Shmee is definitely going to have a hard time after this one
Only thing they would influence me to do is NOT listen to them.
Shmee deserves a slapping for that STO abomination. It was passable until he put the yellow wrap bits on it. Now it's uglier than a hatful of arseholes......
Thats cool and all but what about the youtubers get liveried with their youtube profile pictures
Luckily tj hunts mustang is a gt350 replica
Bring clarkson to roast
I give Shmee credit though that he openly admits it’s garish and over the top. But that’s why he did it, it’s a Lamborghini after all
The Mustang abomination made me cry.
When you're painting yellow road markings and go straight over the car .....
Nice Pepsi Rolex
I've have not stop laughing🤣🤣🤣
Richard Hammond trying to be funny when he is not.
****Yep... Shmee150 definitely has issues with colors. I'm glad you said it too cause he ruined that lambo with that color combo. Not the only one he has ruined.
Who in their right mind upgrades a GT350 with a nissan engine?! That is appalling, and as punishment, you must give the car to me.
Other than Ben Collins, I don't know any of the people quoted.
I hope it's just the lighting but Richard looks a bit jaundice
Any of Ross reviews ford falcons? Hmmm? Hmm?
If he thinks Collete's 350z is out there, just wait until he sees the rest of her fleet 🤣
Roasting of the Messiah can only mean one thing resurrection off the Easter bunny, hammond you want be in the Hunt come Sunday
Gt350 replica…
2:01 always the hamster sounds
Just proves a lot of these rich YouTubers have no taste lol
Love your work 👍
Now we need some regular content from the Smallest Cog.
To be fair, Collette's car is an absolutely fabulous drift missile.
WhistlinDiesel actually got another car, a lambo (Huracan I believe) and it isn't brown (yet)
What TJ made was an inspiration on tokyo drift and nothing is wrong.
You nailed Shmee!
Hammond Needs to Roast The Smokestang
Looks to me like Shmee is trying to make his own barbie coloured car..
Haha 😄 should of told Collete to put a bumper on it I can live with the colour 😄
I believe the original rear bumper will not fit back on the Lamborghini once it’s been twin turbo charged
Tjs wasn't a real gt350 👌💯 Replica of fast and furious Tokyo drift car .
After 17 years of top gear (the grand tour included), i came to conclusion that factory stock car is the best design. No need to add on any kits.
Considering Hammond IS the only one from the holy trinity that has a business in automotive world he is probably the worlds authority on these things.
A kazillion horsapowaaaa me want
RB26 is way more better engine than mustang v8.
I love that Collette did that paint scheme
Thank got its not a real gt350 haha 🤣
Hammond maybe hate shmees STO yellow stripe thing
Collete needs a slap
It would be interesting to see what he thinks of Sarah-N-Tuned’s cars.  Especially since she has a James May cutout in her shop and not a Richard Hammond one.  She has several nice cars in her garage.  A MR2 that is tastefully OEM+.  She just got a nice ‘83 Audi UR Quattro.  Currently she is refurbishing her grandmothers ‘94 Ford Ranger.   Nothing over the top like some YouTube influencers out there.
LOL that Hurricane
Disagree with the roast of Shmee150 Huracan, the STO is a special edition and needed something radical, tbh any lambo should be in a ridiculous color, it’s a ridiculous car! Also in shmees defence - his car collection must be one of the best of all the YouTubers in terms of taste, I think he has earned his dues when it comes to choice.
It was not a gt350. It was a replica. Also it's a chassis swap. No shot of restoring it
I'm no expert but 1. I'm pretty sure the fact Colette is blonde and female is why it's called Barbie (Barbie was also blonde and female, shocking I know. Its pink cause 2. she's a girl! ,of course it's pink ! 🤣  It's honestly not that much of a surprise when a girl paints her car pink...👍🤣
Cheers Richard!!! That was fun 😁
Nothing wrong with an rb in a mustang lol goes better than the asthmatic 289 it came with 🤷‍♂️🤣 If u think that's bad I probably shouldn't mention that I've seen em with jzs, ls1s, small block chevs, barras and even seen one with a twin turbo gm v6 🤣 There just cars dude, honestly who cares what people put in them, if it makes them happy than go for it, there are no rules when it comes to building cars. (Obviously there's legal rules but that's not what I'm talking about) 👍
Me wanting for grand tour💀💀
I really want to do an American translation of Hammonds reactions.
Dde tt f12
Yes put the V8 back TJ
I'm still waiting to see Jeremy Roast Youtubers cars
I love shmees STO its fking awsome
Woah hello Hammond in glasses 🥵
Very surprised Stradman’s Cars we’re not there
Fantastic..video. He told them what they need to hear
I'd still love to see either Richard or James seeing Westen Champlin's 12 valve mustang
The Mustang needs to be kidnapped and rebuilt by someone who appreciates and respects the car.
its not even a real mustang to begin with tho
its not even a real mustang to begin with tho
Wow he actually reviewed WhistlinDiesel's R8
A few cars I'd love to see either Richard or James roast. B is for builds 240z v10, or one of the huracans Tavarish's McLaren Any Mighty car mods cars, just an episode on them would be great (can't half tell I'm a massive fan of them) Just to name a few. There is a lot more, you could almost have a weekly show out of it
Collete Davis has the worst taste in color combos(way worse than shmee) and tuning in cars, especially in bodykit too.
Richard Hammond watching Whistlin diesel Toyota Hilux durability test video
1:00 Never seen Tokyo Drift have you? Ford v8s are a dime a dozen here in the states and boring.
You should have roasted whistlin’ diesel’s hilux
Have you had your teeth whitened?
997.2, such a perfect car. Turbo or not.
Tj’s car isn’t a real GT350 he said the previous owner just put the stickers on there
Richard Hammond is one of the greatest gifts to the automotive world
Should have done this video earlier
Shmees Lamborghini looks like someone really wanted a Aston Martin but couldn’t get one for whatever reason
When can you get Jeremy Clarkson to roast celebrity cars?
Its a clone 350
That was great. A modest outlook on these cars.A more serious side of Richard. Great video and content Mate. We could use more videos like this one. Well played
I want to see your cars
Hammond, I share your pain with the Mustang, I really do. Such a beautiful car should not be violated like that.
Personally I like the STO spec.  It's a loud and boisterous car, so why not have it in a loud and boisterous colour.  Plus I don't think Hammond realises how much trouble he might be in with the shmee150 CVSO. :) :)
Isn't Collette like sponsored by barbie or something ?
What a roast 😉
That was probably the least offensive thing Whistlin Diesel has ever done to a car.
Somebody got a vest in the junior men’s department.   We roast those we love and admire… 😁
Rhubarb and custard special STO created by shmee 👿🤭Is to be followed up by the Zenvo which is not too dissimilar and it’s going to cost him even more money I don’t know where that boys head is sometimes it’s like buying a Sirloin and knocking up a meat pie and ketchup 👿🤢
His STO reaction was the best … 🤣✌🏼
Poor Schmee, His car actually looks awesome in other lighting. Def a darker shade of pink/purple would have been a better choice though.
Show them daily driven exotics twin turbo f12 or 488
Would love too see jackultramotives cars on this
I think TJ Hunt was trying to recreate the Mustang from the "Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift".  But as great a motor the RB26 is, it does not belong in anything but a GT-R.
Please roast Daily Driven Exotic’s (DDE) cars
Tj Hunts mustang isn't a real gt350 it just a normal mustang
Shmee has the WORST taste ever!
I thought TJs car wasn’t an actual gt350 but once it was built it got carrol shelbys blessing and signature.
Whistling diesel made it on i love it
TJs Mustang wasn’t a factory GT 350, and for that reason I’m okay with the RB swap
Someone needs to show Hammond Westen Champlin's smokestang.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJwW6wfP240
Richard! Love your work.. and generally find you pleasant but, For Some Acronym’s Sake, why Lionel Blair brown for the hair? Bit wrong. Some would say, possibly some animals too, that you’re better looking than a couple of your “co-presenters”/“colleagues” (you know the ones🐩🐗), so why veer off (you know that doesn’t end well🙈) down the Insecure Gentleman’s aisle of t’local Waitrose? p.s. accurate assessment of the cars!
i agree with Shmees Lambo..eyesore
I’m an older guy 51 and grew up around sports cars from the 60’s through the 80’s and was lucky enough to have 79 TransAm 6.6 then went on to getting a 87 5.0 notch back then an IrocZ and then get into luxury but customization back then was rims and radio plus tinted windows lol 😂 in todays world I try not to judge because I really don’t like anything , like neon color schemes are just ridiculous to me why would any human want a bright neon orange or green Lamborghini?? Is not having a Lamborghini enough ? But you need to spend 300+ grand the next day spend another 15 grand on rims and then wrap it another color all within the first week lol and of course the 600 HP is not enough so you throw away warranties and get tunes and superchargers and exhausts lol … I just don’t get it in the late 80’s if you worked reall hard and saved money you would buy a new IROC Z or a mustang or 300Z or Supra and maybe get rims and tint the windows that’s it oops sorry the IrocZ guys would get louvers for the back window lol …. Now with social media people really think it’s normal to own supercars lol 😂 we need to stop following trends in social media because it’s all exaggerated and fake … it’s not reality
It’s funny YouTuber’s own super cars then decide I’m a car reviewer. Ridiculous!😂
I love how he always has some kind of chaos energy about him.
I hadn't known of Collete before, but I don't mind the pinky body with yellow trim/accents in that particular case, it's definitely a bit different, but unlike with Shmee's car, there isn't a third color (black) trying to compete and thereby throwing it off. That Barbie writing does need to go though, but I guess that's the price of sponsorships.
Whistling Diesel being accused of being quiet and understated. LOL he is many things that ain't one of them. I agree with you on Tim's Lamborghini STO
You should have one of Hammond, Clarkson or May (or all 3 together) look at Westen Champlin's collection... Particularly the Cummins Mustang.
Shmee's taste in colors is a bit odd, just like his taste in clothes...
I actually like Shmee's Huracán but on this photo it looks horrible 😖
hahaha. So funny.
great roasting, though with TJ's car, they could have told him that it was just the body shell that was mustang and that it's a build from FF tokyo drift
Hammond needs a better dye job
I absolutely hated pink color car's
I'm assuming hammond didn't watch Tokyo Drift😂
Wait till Hammond sees (and hears) Colette's 3-rotor rx7...
That Huracan STO reminds me why I just can't get into Shmee's channel no matter how hard I try.
Hamster back at it again! MAD!
Worst color on that Lamborghini sto
Ford's car's are lemons
Hammond roasts cars.... because cars try to roast him 😉
I think Richard is wrong about the best Mustang in my opinion. I think the best Mustang ever is the 68" GT500 KR. But i think all Gen1. V8 Mustangs are great. I especially like all Shelby's.
The yellow bits on Shmees car are just wrapped and are black underneath. They can be removed lol
Ben’s car is a 997.1 not .2. Just putting my $0.02 LOL
Why cant we ever see Jeremy roasting YouTubers' cars? Or here's a new idea for a video: The boys roasting each others cars.
Poor mustang
The first guy with the Mustang has watched too much Tokyo drift.
hshahsha I love how he totally missed the point of TJ Hunts mustang🤣🤣🤣
They fixed the over heating
Have any of them reacted to the V8 Tesla yet?
Was hoping he would have roasted Westin’s Cummins swapped mustang
Cool to see Collete Davis' 350z in the thumbnail.
Agreed ,Shmee's STO looks like 9yrs old lambo in nfs game.. horrible..
you should check out Jayztwocents collection of cars
That's pretty much what I was thinking when I saw the video about the M5 touring. He also neglected to mention the fragility of the smg gearbox. It is not disliked because it doesn't feel like a automatic car or manual, it is disliked because it is a fragile expensive repair waiting to happen.
Right in the money. @shmee150 ’s Lamborghini would looks 250% better with the yellow removed especially with such a beautiful base color. Yellow highlights is fine (stitching, calipers) but man the highlights are properly hideous
"Gently Roasted" must be British for "absolutely f*cking destroyed"
Next roast with Clarkson and May :)
What a beast he actually roasts their cars. His reaction to shmee150's car is just priceless 🤣
Richard, your roasting comments about those owners were spot on--in fact I think your were too easy on them. I own & drive Mercedes-Benzes & it would be shameful of me to pervert my cars as they have. You were especially correct about Schmee's car, which looks like an abomination--in fact I find him so annoying I unsubscribed from his channel. Keep holding them accountable.
Its a movie car haven't u seen tokyo drift
Hammond says he knows Collete, but then says that she surely doesn't like that Pink Barbie scheme. Mike needs to show him Collete's Sailor7, the 3 rotor, or her 'Vette (that she painted herself).
The English dress so elegant 😂 can’t wait to see the m5 touring! What do you think about the g80 m3 touring?
Hammond being a savage! ❤️😂
I wish more people thought this way about cars
😂😂😂😂😂😂 hamond kills 😂😂😂
The remark about shmee’s STO is spot on!😂
No way he spoke about mat armstrongs M3 😂
Yooo whistlin' Diesel!!
Tjs gt350 is a clone so no gt350 was harmed
Shmee had the most amazing spec GT Black Series...Then woke up like a foggy ponce and thought "I want it orange 🍊!"
Iv seen matts build on the M3 i can assure you that everything is OEM plus. It looks insane atm and we need more youtubers like him.
I wonder if any of those M5's worked long term? I mean from all the ones made maybe there are one or two somewhere out there which have just worked with normal maintenance until big mileage?  I know its unlikely but surely its possible?
TJ's car is sick imo
I DID enjoy it! Very much! Thank You Richard! 👍
that sto is completely ruined
😂😂😂😂😂
Shmee, stop it, please.. i agree with you Richard. I like his cars collection, but some colour choices are….
Collette looks like she'd be up for a game of hide the sausage.
I guess Hammond never watched Tokyo Drift.
Nah
I'm glad i know who schmee is but have never watched any of his vids, because he seems to be a right pillock
Shmee's Huracan looks AMAZING. Hammond's problem with it is that he is just old lol.
i love tims lambo tho :(
we need Jeremy Clarkson to roast some cars now
TJ hunts cars wasn't really a GT350 it was a replica body kit.
I love schemes lambo.  Richard stuck in boomer territory .lawls
Roast Jezzas cars, go on Hamster you know you want to...
Love it Hammond 👍
Hammond you have to roast them not be nice
Tj Hunts Gt350 is a clone....not a real Gt 350
Disagree with the Hamster on the Lambo. It's a lambo It's supposed to be ridiculous. Being ridiculous is its purpose in life. While I wouldn't have chosen those colors, they don't clash and make eyes bleed, they are attention getting, and certainly in keeping with the ridiculousness that is the Lambo. Also disagree with the complaints against Collete Davis' car. Nothing wrong with a girl having a girly car. I for one don't want to live in a world where the women are just better looking men with masculine traits and desires. I want women to be free to be women and have feminine desires, however they define them. I want to be able to date a women who's more feminine than I am. If that's one of the ways she expresses her femininity, who cares? Maybe she has Mattel as a sponsor? She's a girly girl who loves cars and wrenching on them! What's not to love about that equation?
I saw that M5 estate on the M6 the other day!
AWESOME AMAZING VIDEO  ! ! ! ! ! !
Plz return the heart of that Stang...No one likes a poser...🍻
HAAMMOOOOOND!
we can always rely on the three guys bringing common sense and sensibility to all the flashy social media car influencers. Well done
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
surprised the dde twin turbo f12 hasn't featured yet
I’m pretty sure TJs Mustang wasn’t a real GT350.
I did enjoy that.  A most wonderfully understated "FOR GODS SAKE, WHY?!?!".  Excellent, sir.
I hated shmee's colour choice but i hadsgrown on me but that thing sounds mental you should go to his barn and drive his toys hammond
next Jeremy please
nope - the lambo is excellent
I wish he picked one of Neon Princess Colgate's other hideous cars. The 350 is probably the most tame one, except for her (currently) stock FC which will be used to eventually re-shell her atrocious one.
Did Colette inspire Schmee or the other way around?...
Shmee's Lambo - a thong for 'yurrrp'?
Tony Stark.
He has clearly never watched Tokyo drift 😂😂😂
That Huracan must have crashed into Halfords or possibly Argos 🤣
Hello Hamster 🐹
You can tell he's not the evil one, because he's using an Apple.
No one is safe, not even Drivetribe cars. >D Hammond the Gentlemen Roaster.
He needs to see @gingium ‘s awd miata
"You've removed the V8 and replaced it with an RB26" I know that's supposed to be a roast but that RB is better in every single way to any engines the yanks have ever made
They should do one YouTubers roast car grand tour stars 😂😂😂😂
Please more often. It’s fun
Tj Hunts car was a fake gt350 tho 🤷‍♂️
Not sure if the hamster is the right person to roast other peoples cars. I mean.. Several cars he has driven has literally roasted.
How could Hammond be more boring than James May?
Shmee has the ugliest lambo ever created. The guy should be embarrassed to drive it. He is an insult to everything Lamborghini stands for. They should send him a cease and desist to get that abomination off the road.
TJ's mustang isnt a gt350, it was a replica he bought
TJ’s mustang has an art morrison chassis doesnt it with a body on top?
So refreshing to hear a real opinion and an accurate one too, couldnt agree more Richard!
stop it shemee...just stop
tj's mustang actually wasn't a gt350, it's a replica
Can we make this fortnightly
Hate lamborghini
0:38 he almost went full on Gordon Ramsay
Shmee usually knocks it out of the park with his specs, but that STO is a miss.
TJ hunts mustang wasn't a real gt350 lol. thats why he did the swap.
do rob dahms other cars he has
Shmee‘s STO looks so utterly bad. 😁😁😁😁
Richard…I saw the videos where TJ Hunt was putting that engine in; I don’t think that car was a real GT350…just a regular ‘Stang made to look like one…crisis averted…lol.
HAHAHA! Whistlin Diesel. I modest quiet chap.  Now I've heard everything! Someone please show Richard his channel....or... maybe don't
IT'S BROWNNNNN
2:07
Didn't Hammond once say that Italian's are always loud and flamboyant ,so what's wrong with shmees lambo 🤔 most STO,s are in bright  bold colours ?
Hahaha loved the reaction to the rb26 mustang 😂 for reference it was a replica 350
ngl, I'm kinda glad Clarkson is focussing more on his farming and doesn't appear here much anymore.  James and Richard have fit into this type of content really well, and Clarkson is flourishing on his show. I'd go so far as to say that this stuff is more enjoyable than TGT.  Also the protiges to have come from this and Clarksons Farm are simply excellent. Mike and Lucy are gonna be great successors to Richard and James, and Caleb is absolutely a joy to watch
If you want a proper coloured STO check out Triple F's, https://youtu.be/apTWoJFLWV0 (you're right, Tim's is awful).
Thats not the only car that Mat Armstrong has 😜
Shmee has a bad taste in colours
From a massive car website to some YouTube channel with production quality of channels made by rich 18 year olds with their parents' money, that's just sad
With the way Hammond caused the Cock-O-Meter to go off the charts in a BMW M3, you'd think he would want nothing to do with one  ever again 😁
Shmee’s car looks like a coming out 🏳️‍🌈
Epic roast! 🤯🙌
Its a brown car
This was so polite, it's even hard to call it a roast.
Meh. Still speaks corporate so says almost nothing at all
Brilliant video 👍👍😂
i would love to see his face reacting on cleetus's 5.3 ls swapped lambo xD
Roasting is lame.
Please, more Roasts!
the RB26 mustang is iconic tho.
Thanks Richard 😊
Really can't stand Shmee...
Don't let Clarkson roast the cars. He would bring out a flamethrower.
Never thought I'd say this my man, but agree with you all the way. How's the estate going? Looked really cool.what you where doing with the land.
Richard Hammond wearing glasses...I never thought Id see the day
Would love to see him roast some cars from roadkill
Always love A hamster 🐹roast 🍖😅🤣😆🤣🥰🤣😂!
No one: RodDahm awd 4 rotor rx7 is beast Hammond:do you what i think put 3 rotor and original diffential on it
RB for life
Do we think Hammond's seen tokyo drift?
Haha love this!!
Coming from a man who drives an Opel Kadett
lol, Colette is actually sponsored and works for Barbie Mattel Inc.  and yea she does love pink..
Next time I want one of my rotboxes including haha!
Wait until he sees Colette's Corvettes new paint job !
Now someone who will really destroy these cars is Jeremy
shmee really does have the worst spec STO i have ever seen and ive seen a lot of STO videos. holy cow
Tell Hammond the yellow is a wrap on the STO
Wish Hammond would dye his hair 🤣🤣🤣
the GT350 wasn't a real 350. The previous owner added those decals
If you don't like turbo bits hanging out where you can see them, don't tune into Drag Week, Sick Week, Rocky Mountain Race Week or other similar events.... It's a thing, and celebrated.
Who are these people???? I only know Ben Collins 🤷🏻
When he called the R8 brown it killed me
TJ's car was not a real GT-350. Just a clone. You also picked the least worst of Collete's cars to roast.
Tj Hunt, Mustang is NOT a Gt 350‼️ It is just a Regular with a Sticker Mate🤣
This man needs an Oscar
You should get my dad doing it with him as in Neil that would be funny
Shmee really has the ugliest STO. One of the most incredible cars in the world made hideous.
I want to see shmee react to Hammond reacting to his lambo 😂
"It's not brown, it's Sunburst Orange".  Sorry...
Thank you! The yellow on the STO is appalling and he covered up what made the original car a great spec.
People really don't like the STO. It's a wild colour but Lambos are not meant to be white or black. That's the Lambo owners we should be roasting imo
Hamster for the win! 👏🏻 Completely concur with all your results.. 👍🏻😎
Poor Shmee all his Specs were perfection Even Genius but this one wasn't and the yellow made it worse and I say this being a Mega Fan
Excellent! One simply can't get the staff anymore, you know...😂🤣😂🤣
TJ Hunt and Shmee need to remove themselves from this planet.  I can't stand these clout chasers.
That Huracan STO looks more like an STD.
Hammond "I know collette" Proceeds to question why the cars is pink and says barbie on the side
Shmee is reportedly has a net worth of 15 million, however his taste in colour combinations and striving to have something different than anyone else is sadly lacking in any value or worth
Couldn't agree more with his assessment of shmeeeeeeeeeee 'hi guys' horrendous carbuncle
When will the new grand tour episodes come?
Is there a Mike rouch here?
most of that was fair but tj's mustang wasn't a real gt350 so it was fair game to swap the engine
Lol roast my cars
Can someone close to Shmee just pull him aside and see if he's okay.
Great roast but seem to have forgotten to roast my car??? 😢😮😮😮
Hopefully wraps are being utilized , a visit to a wrap specialist with a endless color panels is a bit dangerous , you can see the cars are frowning inside .
Shmee car colour scheme is the worst !!!!’ 😂😂😂
Whistlin Diesel has a Huracan now as well.  WD also did a Toyota Hilux durability test, would love to see Hammond react to it.
He couldn’t even insult Shmee’s car all he could do was laugh 😂
Right, I know what Jeremy and May should give to Richard, a pink car.
T.J. Hunt's GT350 mustang was a replica it started it's life as a 6 cylinder.
love the vibrant pink on the sto but with yellow...just no
gentle?
I just read through half of the comments stating that TJ’s Mustang was not a GT350. This is true, sounds like someone didn’t do their research. TJ set out specifically looking for a clean Mustang that was not special. It will be done someday, in due time.
Hammond I love your reaction to Schmee's STO but Collette and her Barbie 350Z well you do realize she used that and her 3 Rotor RX-7 were used to secure her sponsorship by Mattel so as hideous as it may be it worked if you're going to roast one of Collette's cars roast her Sailor moon themed RX-7 or her Vette for their brash color schemes
I always said Shmee has bad color taste
Not one roast in this video was funny.
Just epic
"won't be nasty"  Hammond hmmmm  dose roasting a  1 Million dollar Rimac Concept One  fall under Nasty
Shmee getting roasted for his STO is so justified. I mean his collection of cars is wonderful but mn that STO could have been better.
Tj will love this.
That STO looks like something you'd find in a baby's playpen.
Wait till Hammond see Shmee's Zenvo once its completed 😅
That exposed R8 rear is basically a man (or woman) wearing assless chaps.
YES I WAS HOPING HAMMOND SAW TJ’S RB MUSTANG 🤣
HAMMMMMOOONNDDDDDD
I follow Shmee because he buys such cool cars. But the second he specs them or starts tuning/painting them i stop watching. It's like my taste when i was 16 years old and watched the Fast & Furious 1.
to be fair, TJs car wasnt a real gt350.
Apart from the Barbie written down the side that is the best colour combination ever.
Wait a sec... the mustang was a real Shelby? Like a real real one?  Thats a pretty dumb thing to do then.
Rb26>anything else
This is the most generous roasting I've ever seen
tj hunts mustang wasnt a real gt350 tho. it was a replica
I subscribed to TJ Hunt, just so I could unsubscribe over that Mustang.
The first car obviously wanted to live out Tokyo Drift in real life.
Shmee must be on strong drugs when he specced the STO 🤦🏽‍♂️
Shmee take note!! Get rid of those horrible color accents lol
HAMMOND YOU ...... Really cool guy
Take that #Tjhunt
Finally something worth of one of the trio that use to be best journalists in a car journalisam👍👍👍
Surprised Jordan Maron (CaptainSparklez) hasn't been on this once, he's got quite a few nice automobiles, which I'd love to see be rated/roasted.
Richard Hammond didn't put the Riche Build LS Swap Tesla Model S in this build. he can't roast that car because it's converted from EV into a combustible machine in a right way.
I'm 2 and a half minutes in and I disagree with pretty much everything so far.
Have a look at Cleetus Macfarland's El Camino.
Shmees gonna wrap his sto now 🤣🤣🤣
Man that lambo is made to look like a mcdonalds advertisement
Shmee's Huracan is awesome
Even Hammond who is a secret American roasted the mustang
Keep them coming.
TJ's Mustang wasn't an actual GT350 just a clone so it makes it a bit better.
2:35 i can see a Michael Jordan meme here (stop it, get some help) 😂
What's wrong with Shmee's choice of colour for the STO? It's his choice and looks cool.
shmee's car reminds me of when people buy a new charger or challenger and it comes with those yellow lip protector things, and the owner leaves them on and it looks really dumb
Richard, you are such a nice bloke :)
I have to agree about the outlandish Lamborghini. You yourself said it was a car that a banker would buy .
Hey little hamster. Don't make fun of shmee. Otherwise I tell everyone that you have a small sausage
He did not go easy on Shmee.  Sweet Holy Moses.
TJ's car wasn't a GT350, just had the stripe down the side.
Watching this was......a Waste of time
That wasn’t a GT350, just a GT with 350 bits
I've never heard of any of these YouTubers.
SUNBURST ORANGE.
Shmee's Lambo looks like an angry McDonald's logo on wheels.
Lambos need to scream, Shmee did the right thing with that.
The color of shmees lamborgini looks terrible
Tj was dumb
"""influencers""" no idea who half of these people are
Get dde cars here
If TJ‘s car was a GT 350 then I agree he’s a massive idiot for ruining an already valuable car! If it’s a regular 67, then It’s less of an issue!
If the M5 V10 doesn't have any warning lights on, it most likely means the warning light is broken, too.
If I were Shmee, and I had extra time on my hands, I would painstakingly wrap all the black parts of the STO (including the rims) with a dark blue colour, to form a split-complimentary colour scheme. After that, it will no longer look like a hodge podge (cause all the colours would be balanced).
Some say that Ben Collins can go from 0 to 60 faster than a sneeze, and that he was on some BBC show that's gone down in quality after series 22.
TJ's car was NOT a GT350 😅
TJ made that mustang better tbh
Everyone: You can't make a car look like rhubarb and custard. Shmee150: Hold my camera, cheeEEeeEEeeEErs
That will be rly hard to roast car in the future, tesa, tesla, tesla, tesla.... :D
Ben Collins should come on and roast some cars, he's a legend.
I'm really really really really really really really sorry but I like the STO in that colour scheme...
The mustang is not a real 350
Nicely done Hammond... That was a taste full roasting.
They need to do daily driven exotics cars because they have some wild cars they built in the last 3 year’s
Tj's mustang was never a gt350 it was a rep, it has had a new chassis to go with the engine.
Another amazing video with an amazing character
🇺🇦
Could be wrong but im pretty sure tj's mustang wasn't an actual gt350.
Funny enough from a guy who can barely drive a car without wrecking it!
Shmee is king
Fabulous made appalling? I totally disagree, and I think Hammonds age is definitely showing with that statement, a total old man opinion. It’s a Lamborghini, it’s supposed to be flashy!
Izzat a 90's Vance and Hines Lambo...?
Ok, I understand doing Fastback Mustangs with RB26 swaps because Tokyo Drift, but a GT350? Why.
I was honestly expecting Hammond to like Tim's Lambo, I'm sure i remember the guys saying a super car is meant to be crazy and in your face etc.. and the colours Tim's gone for certainly make that STO look special and crazy.
We need Jezza to do such an episode.
Hammond would have a lot to say about stradman‘s fleet
Next do Clarkson Roasting farmers tractors for a laugh 😂
lol the poor taste of shmee right there
Please have Hammond review all of Shmee's cars with their specs.
Jealousy is a curse. At least these YouTubers haven't crashed cars!
Wait till everyone sees what Shmee did to his Zenvo, lol
Is this some sort of hearing test?
Well nice roast.  But you was given a few puff cars.   But  you are right.  That Shmee picasso mess is just wrong.   The paint ok for unique  but that yellow is just childish crayon 5 year old choice. But what color to have with that unique color?    Black? Gray? Well it's so unique no one will copy it.   But if you need to do a roast  roast his collection in the milk barn....
If that was a real gt350 I'd agree with Hammond, but it's not
Hammond just likes saying "Shmee"
Today we learned that Hammond hasn’t seen Tokyo Drift
Thought Hammond might have something to say about the Heart alloys on the Barbie 350Z
Calm down, it's impossible to make a Huracan any worse.
SHMEE's Lambo is epic, fun and optimistic. Its STO not Prius imho.
For some reason, i'm feel like i'm listening Gordon Ramsay complain about weird things in social media as usual, but in cars language.
Next video, the 1000tipla
Call me weird but i love the spec of the STO from Shmee.
I’d love your thoughts on my recent purchase, L322 TDV8 in Westminster Blue
Shmee's car the most embarrassing car I've ever seen. From the bottom of my heart, I would be embarrassed to drive that Barbie machine.
Shmee's Huracan made me crave rhubarb crumble and custard.
I love that color scheme of the STO
Lol i expected ben collins car to be a ferrari...i dont know why😅
Roasting cars? More like character assassinations
He looks so creepy in a suit 😂😂
The 350z and the huracan sto has the same spec
Schmee blows.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can I get a pin
Shmee’s STO is the perfect example that you can’t buy taste.
Hammond: "TJ what were you thinking???" 'Teriyaki Boyz intensifies'
Shmee 150  is the worst youtuber I can think of.
I didn't know it was a GT350! If it had been a straight six fastback... but a GT350?! What have you done?!
Shmee is clearly color blind. I like both colors but together the make think an exorcism is called for.
What about lesser known influencers with cool cars?   You Hammond were chosen as a top gear host because you drove off the audition in a poor bloke Porsche 911 3.2, they saw in you the right attitude so you should do the same towards the emerging talents
So did Hammond see tokyo drift or not ?
ayy mat armstrong made it in the video
How have you not shown the Hellcat with the wooden wheels by mr Diesel
Shmee and collet with the same livery
moast of the cars look like thair out of a mad max movie!
I actually unsubbed from shmee his content was soooo annoying
That first huracan looks like a transformer’s vehicle mode from the 80’s
Love all of the Shmeemobiles but hammonds reaction to the lambo was exactly my reaction as well. 😄
The reaction to Shmee's car is so fair. He has specced his other cars quite tastefully but the STO is so, so wrong.
@5:40 lol 😂
Shmee's Hurican STO spec is just crazy. I LOVE IT
I was hoping to see DDE’s F12 TT
Richard... I was with you until the Barbie Drift Car....  It's a girls car... Get a clue...:-(
Richard reacting to Shmee's Huracan STO was hilarious, However I like Shmee's STO but I respect those who don't like it.
0:30 TJ must have gotten his inspiration from the movie "The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift" where they did exactly that! 😂
shmee needs to get rid of the yellow bits. it looked cool originally. but it's his car not mine so whatever lol
So, it's not okay to write Barbie on your car, but it is okay to have heart shaped alloys?
TJ's Mustang was not a GT350 originally, afaik it was a conversion.
Two things the world could do with less of: 1. Ambulance chasing lawyers 2. Youtube influencers  At least Hammond and May make decent use of the existence of the latter.
That Lambo has a moustache, clearly they ripped the design off the Hammerhead Eagle i-Thrust!
Wow the reaction to the Huracan was perfect. I mean it is shmee's car but these color combos are something else.
mike is gonna be calling you for a ride hammond lol
Hello Hammond.
1:49 same reaction when he added the yellow bits to the Huracan.
we need jeremy and james doing it too
Shmee took a shark and made it look like a boiled catfish.
"you're going to go far in drifting" probably the biggest cut on the internet.
Why did you Mr Diesel?
2:30 Finally someone calling out Shmee's 💩 STO spec
Early gang
TJ Hunt did that mustang because of fast and furious
Unlike Hammonds cars, these ones are the right side up and not on fire.
TJ deserved getting roasted lol 😂
"What were you thinking, TJ?"  *cough* Tokyo Drift
Shmee must have a problem with his sight. That STO is cereal box spec.
Why you don’t mention Stradman
Richard Hammonds is definitely one of the best people alive right now 😂
Yes mat Armstrongs name finally getting around, the guys a goat
Can’t wait to se whistling diesels comment on this I don’t think Hammond know who he is
That poor gt mustang and I don't even like mustangs. There are tons of regular mustangs you could have used to improve them. You don't ruin a GT by hacking it up like that,
That STO is so disgusting...
Honestly, that STO is an eyesore, I agree with Hammond. But anyways, it's his preference.
Mustangs with straight sixes are amazing. To much love for v8s really
Please do Noriyaro’s AE86
Tbf to TJ it was a fake gt350   And as much as I love mustangs the rb26 is cool
He's actually roasting the cars fair play 😂
Teejs Mustang is a replica
More of this content!
Hammod is the best for making these videos! His reaction to Shemee's Lambo is epic! (1:58) 😂An idea turns: Hammond roasting Clarkson's cars!
Richard Hammond wears a pinky ring and crash expensive vehicles.
I have a 66 Mustang Coupe and I'm actually about to put a 2JZ in mine
We need more of this
one view one minute one richard hammond
Cheese 🧀
Oh Shmee's STO, I hope it has been properly run in meanwhile (+5000km or so)
Woo
First
Bet he can't roast my 911
