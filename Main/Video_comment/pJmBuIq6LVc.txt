valverde ❤
Now they return to the Champions League tonight after a two year sabbatical leave😂😅😅
What fans don't know is that Madrid and Chelsea play similarly but different experience levels because the mentality between Madrid and Chelsea are similar
Enzo said before the match that I'll score and celebrate like my idol Messi and guess what Rodrygo did 😂
Which year was this March played?
I miss this Rodrigo so much considering what the scenario is rn
3:35 5:04
Rodrygo was trolling on that 2nd goal🤣🔥💯🙏😭
Come on Chelsea come on Chelsea.
That goal from valverde was absolutely disgusting 🤮
Only Kante and haverts
Nice match I support real Madrid
Am a City fan but Chelsea are the future Real Madrid by far.
Chelsea cant score Real can
People don’t understand how good that assist from valverde is honestly. Absolutely world class
To anyone thinking rodrygo done the suii because he thinks he’s Ronaldo your wrong. He done it because Enzo said if he scores against Madrid he will do a Messi celebration cmon guys think before ya open ya moths
Enzo played for benfica in this years Champions League how is he eligible to play
My freinds saying Chelsea have a chance of a comeback
Ohh some American phaa
Who signed lampard back..  joke
Kante is great
This could be Real Madrid's last champion league. With so many top old great players leaving this season. Next season could be a new Real Madrid squad and big spending in the transfer market. This battle against Manchester City in the semi-final may be a legendary game. Great fair well to the Real Madrid team.
Breaking news: Modric plans for early retirement in 3020
We'll turn it around in the 3rd leg - Todd Boehly
That stadium is a shitter
Shouldn’t change ownership and tuchel
Trademark smile ? Trademark eyebrow more like
ronaldo
city will dismantle this madrid team
Frank Lampard is the best coach for chelsea, no cap
I can't see Man City beating Real over two-leagues.
RODRYGO’S SEWY😂😂
Rodrigo idol siuuuu
I have only one word for Lampard               D I S S A P P O I N T M E N T
When rodrygo hit the sui that got me😂
Chelsea are teetering on the brink of going nowhere fast. They are quite a small club in the grand scheme of things, before abramovich turned up, who was going to buy spurs first, bought them, they were mid table league Cup finalists type club. Nice location changed Romans mind, he must have seen the surrounding edmonton neighbourhood in Tottenham and thought naaah. This place is ready made. They are a team of finished articles, not young scared lads.
NGOlo Kante long time no see
Chelsea didn't play the Champions League anthem to make Real Madrid think this is just a regular match. Look at the confusion on the faces of Madrid players as they walk out onto the pitch lol
Real Madrid scoring sweaty fifa goals🤣🤣🤣🤣 love to see it
Why Rodrigo did this thing 's world cup?😂😅😢
Let Putin have chelsea again.
Rodrigo just did the siu
Why did Rodrigo do the Sui
Why tf did Rodrigyo sui 💀💀
MY FRIEND WALKET OUT WITH A PLAYER
How Frank Lampard is still getting manager jobs baffles me
SUPER RODRIGO!!!!
Imagine sacking Tuchel to get Potter then sacking him for Lampard 😂  Who on earth sacked Tuchel he was the best manager they had since the Special one he won them the champions league top 4 finishes and I think a cup they are a shadow of there former selves Chelsea last seasons meet between these two was special but this season they were a complete mismatch.
oh my what a save 2:44
chelsea 📉📉📉📉😂
people are roasting Lampard but how on earth is this his fault Kante had to score that at the start but not one person has mentioned it (Arsenal fan )
What an achievement for another American owner, to suck the life out of an English football club that has been playing sublime football for years, look what happened to United since Glazers
Real Madrid didn’t get out of 3rd gear if Chelsea had scored Real Madrid would have up the game , all there players no how to get across the line simple
Carlo Ancelotti, low profile, a real gentleman, great football player and an incredible coach. Legend of legends. 👏🏻
chelsea ladys would hammer chelsea men
As witnessing the match at the bottom row seats I can confirm chelsea have officially became a joke💀
Sacked in the morning
Man rodrygo really is a talent
I knew Chelsea would sink once the Russian Money stopped coming in. The fans should just do what they do best, waiting tables at the local restaurants and leave football for the professionals
So poor. We actually make some decent chances, but everyone is so low on confidence that nothing ever comes of them.
Lampard 😂😂😂😂😂
Anyone who thinks Chelsea demise is big , just wait until Manchester City’s turn , it’s coming and it will be spectacular
This match was the final nail in the coffin. The players can sign off and go away..
Unbelievable downhill for Chelsea. Hopefully next season
If it was anyone else other than Kante to drag it like that people would eat them alive. I dont care what his position is that was absolutely criminal. Overrated
Sterling was the most disastrous purchase in the entire history of the premier league
Can't wait to see Chelsea get relegated this season
The talking guy with strong accent is super vulgar !! 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
2 down from 1st leg, let's play a defensive setup to over turn it, love it
Why is frank hugging everyone and their auntie, keane was right.
4 games for lampard.. 4 defeats. Oh your good...!!! Not
Why couldnt Chelsea just wear blue socks and Madrid wear white?? That annoyed me all game lol
Why did Rodrigo sui on a open goal disrespectful
siuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
im sorry great player for chelsea and england but could not manage a fish supper
keep up the great work fat frank
How come antteloti couldn’t do it at Everton?
Fat frank at the wheel ya'll fucken hilarious YNWA
That Rodrygo sui😵‍💫
Siuuuu
Lampards at the wheel lol
When Kante is your biggest goal threat your in trouble
A proper manager would get some sort of tune out of this squad e.g ten hag. Feel sorry for lampard.
Hahahaha
Doesn’t matter what team an English team is beaten in Europe not enough time is spent praising the other team and simply respecting their win
to think Enzo Fernandes moved from 1st in the league to a middle table club it’s mesmerising
Chelsea are not doing well this season
S😅uuuuuu
The fact that hazard cant get into this madrid team but walks into the chelsea lineup sums it all up
Kante is a fraud
Chelsea suffer hugely from lack of confidence and wasting so many golden opportunities is a proof of that while Real Madrid took her seldom chances with confidence and scored easily.
"Has to take him out". Classy from Macca.  Anyway, I think Lampard is a worse manager than Potter. At least with Potter there was a "project" when they were losing with Lampard there's not even a project when they are losing. Lampard is tactically not as good as Potter, not as charismatic, has less managerial experience, less inspiring, & is also making the same mistake that Potter made in not playing Aubameyang their own decent CF.
Way too easy for real
Sacking Tuchel after spending big in the transfer window was madness. Boehly is an amateur
Fat Frank what a legend 😂😂😂
Haaland on his own has scored more goals than Chelsea this season.
Rodrygo with the suiii
Member when foke said kante was world class 😂😂😂😂😂 never been close to it
Let's just wait till next season to see where Chelsea will be at. They are going through a huge transition.
Chelsea spent 600m on what
Chelsea fans can say what they want? The real truth is sacking Tuchel  was the biggest mistake made by the club. Lampard will win a game but not many! All the money spent I can’t believe how shockingly bad they are
chelsea seem to play decent football but the players look like they’ve forgotten how to shoot. They look very similar to brighton last year who struggled to score under potter but once he left, players that struggled are scoring for fun. Feels like any team potter has managed struggle to score goals
Imagine the glazers leaving utd and then the new owner sacking ten hag then putting ole back at the wheel lol
What an impact, Frank is having. JT next?
Rodrygo did the sui celebration
Real madrids second goal was so disrespectful 🤣🤣🤣  EA sports fifa like 🤣🤣
Rodrygo hit the suii
Stop crying Frank lampard
Despite all of the hype. When push comes to shove. The Premier League still has a long way to go.
This is the worst Chelsea performance since last week
I feel for Lampard. He tactically outclassed Ancelotti but as usual the players couldn't put the ball in the back of the net and Courtois proved why he's the best GK in the world. Then eventually a defensive mistake and the sucker punch comes.
I thought that Real Madrid would win by more
The players at Chelsea may likey down tools even in the championship
Lampard 007 soon
Rodrygo realy did the sui
Last year it was a tough game Cz Chelsea had Tuchel,but this time it was so easy for Real Madrid 💙😊
Another club and another taxi for lampard 😂😂😂
The South Africans were just too good 😂
Chelsea pumped lots of money still bad . Horrible 😢
Modric is an absolute monster
does the chelsea owner even know whats going on lol guy looks clueless lol
I thought before this game.... Kante went from Chelsea's defensive talisman to their most attacking player These highlights confirm it he's never even back for defense anymore
Just want west ham and leeds down now  and it's a good season
I'm not a Chelsea supporter but I have to say Frank is a plank! How he steps back into this role I've no idea ...shocking he hasn't got a clue And as usual supporters leaving early instead of following their team 💯 per cent win or lose it's disgraceful
Vinicius and Rodrigo look scary
Adios.....Frank !
Brighton and Benfica royally mugged off Chelsea. Not forgetting Man City selling Sterling for £60m. Arsenal escaped buying Mudryk, offered £40m and Chelsea buy him for £88m.
Chelsea have no killers anymore in front of goal. Every player they have is a limp wristed fanny when it comes to being cold and clinical.  Also - 2 sweaty goals RM scored show good unselfishness. Chelsea players would not pass in those situations.
What a nice Game
Chelsea luser team.
Everyone knew chelsea would lose, madrid are too good at champions league
😂😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉
Suuiiii
Real Madrid look like they got a bit lucky here.
nice spelling Highlighights lel
Frank Lampard is the worst caretaker since Ian Huntley
Too much snobbery in football. Go get Macaulay Langstaff or Paul Mullin both know EXACTLY with the onion bag is. It’s not difficult.
The commentator should be banned for saying he should take him out ie foul him. It's disgusting and anti football
Utter shambles
Instantly mute anything when these two clowns are on commentary, can't stand listening to them.
Can't help but feel sorry for Thiago Silva
Come back Roman
Why on earth is Kante where the centre forward should be? Havertz is a pathetic excuse for a UCL striker.
Chelsea are going Back to what they used to be 20 years ago. A mid table club
"Real Madrid silence stamford bridge". All I heard was silence apart from the Madrid fans all game anyway.😂
Chelsea fans don't make any noise at all
still turn up in big numbers next home game most not stop till glazers are gone manchester united fans
Chelsea’s finishing is a joke 😂😂
If City lose to Real Madrid again, that will be your sign to stop using English bias against Real Madrid. Club has been disrespected for long enough so that time needs to come to an end now
The greatest team of all time.   Y’all gotta realise Chelsea didn’t underperform, Real Madrid is just great at football.
Chaloba stays down and walks after him, no one who plays professional football should be that lazy
Man did SUIIII celebration 🍾
first goal was chalobah's fault for sliding like a headless chicken- second goal was just amazing - the forward run and dummy from cabellos, and then the way valverde just put it on a plate for Rodrygo, even stevie wonder would have scored that! well deserved win for Madrid!
Hazard😢
As a Chelsea fan can y'all stop blaming Lampard ? These lot can't score it's not that hard. Doesn't matter if Kante is a defender or Cucurella. Reece James and Ben Chilwell are defenders they would've scored that. These are all two in opportunities. Really really basic stuff. We dominated a game for 60mins, created chances and fluffed them all.
Sad
Look at all the Chelsea fans walking out at 79 mins those ain't fans .
Only man city can probably beat real Madrid
Have to feel sorry for Lampard, he's not going to say no to this job. I don't understand why they brought him back as caretaker. Clueless
Easy to laugh after all, don't forget Real Madrid is in the top 3 in the world... after City, Bayern
That 'pride of London banner' though.
Chelsea lb is one of the worst I've seen
Frank lampard the man they said, phahaga
all that money spent and they have won nothing this season
Thiago Silva turning around just before Rodrygo's second goal is painfull to see🤣5:54
Kante our best striker
Anyone who thought Chelsea was going to knock out Madrid is delusional 😂
Maybe Lampard can win ‘pitch invasion of the year’ two years in a row.   That would be a great achievement! 😂.
Which poor club is next for lampard to ruin
madrid got it this year
disgusting disrespect from rodrygo for his goal, supposed to be a paid professional. (arsenal fan, don't care about the result)
madrid kept it clean.
Rodrigo 😂😂😂😂
Lampard didn't appoint himself as manager.
Always Brazillians making a Party 🎉
Chelski didn’t actually play THAT bad .. lots of positives to take away from it. Need Romelu though.
What they cut out was McMannaman saying ‘Valverde to Rodrygo, a goal made in South Africa’
over 600K investment 😄glad it is not on Ziyech thank God. Well deserved and the coming is worse Arrogant club arrogant Bohely and ignorant fan base.I feel sorry for Lampard it is definitely not his fault.
How is Modric still playing at this level?...🤔🤔
Chelsea players need to practice putting the goal in the net - not round the net, net over the net but in the bloody net
CR7 SUIIII
May as well have stuck with Potter until the end of the season.
We talk about fine margins and taking your chances, Chelsea had a few tbf
😅😂😂😂😂😂😂
That was so easy for real madrid. Training ground session. As for Chelsea and lampard. That starting lineup was so cowardly and awful.
How many more matches do Chelsea have to lose before Lampard gets the boot?
Love seeing Frank crumble after how big he thought his bollocks were when he first managed chelsea, arguing with other managers on the touchline etc  Super Franks last job in the prem 👋
both matches were just so bad to watch... chelsea dont have attack and good mid players to create chances... atm they dont deserve to play in cl , thats to much for them
Lovely to see the Chelski supporters running home ....Well done Super Frank 100% record
Thanks RM for knocking this plastic club out.
Good old lampard never fails oh wait he has lol
Cucurella is NEVER worth 50mill 😂
Come on Chelsea. At least score 1 goal
Cannot comprehend how a team can spend 600 million and do so poorly
Valverde fifa toty 😂
Rodrigo's second goal he just walks it in 🤣😂 deluded Chelsea fans actually believed they would win last night 🙈🤣
Franky lamps playing Kante as CAM and playing Connor Gallagher…. Chelsea were set up to lose.
Plastic flags were out 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
How is lampard even in management 😂its the craziest thing ever
Did anyone notice the commentator was biased towards the English team   As always.
Chelsea fans leaving after the 2nd goal was music to my ears 🎶
I am still going nuts over made in south africa
Why was Enzo bought,  he cannot run faster than a 12 year old girl...
chelsea cant even score offside goals... this is criminal 🤣🤣🤣 hala madrid
Shame on Chelsea's fans for booing Cortouis everytime he touched the ball. They deserve to leave from the stadium in shame.
Chelshit😂😂😂
I’m not a Chelsea fan but bringing someone like lampard back says it all
Who wants to play Real Madrid, l think they will go all the way again.
Chelsea where poor overall but mad how much Kante being back makes them better...Madrid in final 3rd are just unreal
Why on earth did Chalobah slide there!!!
3 sitters missed.
I really think they need to rebuild the defence
3:40 why the ronaldo celebration?
It will either be 2 in a row for *Real Madrid* or else it will be *Manchester City’s* year in the Champions League
See how rodrygo stopped the ball first before finishing. None of this rushed first time finishing nonsense, even in that situation crowded by defenders.
The players were to be blamed not the manager, they have got 3 managers sacked, at the point it doesn't matter who is the manager, if Chelsea can bring back all their previous good managers and to coach the team together, as long as the players are not serious nothing will change
Lampard in phenomenal form 4 out of 4 !! Oh yeh haha defeats !! He is not ready for the big leagues , maybe Wrexham or someone should’ve taken him for PR
Kovacic is so lazy on that second goal. He easily could have stopped that but instead decided to slowly jog back to his own net.
What is Kante doing as their attacking midfielder getting on thrones of chances!?!  He’s the best in the world at disrupting.. not the best in the  world at finishing!
Cucurella😂😂😂...is a funny player🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Chelsea love 💙🙏🏾  Hopefully we’ll be back 🔜
why didnt the keepr dive to try save the first goal ?
I love how Thiago doesn't even look at the second goal at 5:45 LOL
Can’t believe Hazard can’t get into this team
Who tf are all these new guys, pure trash.
This is all Putin's fault !
Just goes to show, spending obscene money doesn't work all the time😂😂😂
Chelsea’s biggest problem is the owner
Lampard 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
the greatest european team ever . no disgrace losing to real . double their nearest rivals . 14 /7 to inter milan .
Chelsea are a laughing stock
The fall of the roman empire 😮
Lampard in 👍👍👍
Lampard the manager not a patch on Lampard the player, but some of the mistakes/misses by his players have to be seen to be believed. Whether anyone can get this lot to operate at the level required is questionable, certainly Frank can't.  They've avoided the clutches of relegation this year but look a real bet for season 2003/04.
Let’s not blame Frank. Give him a 5 year contract and let him build his own squad.  He’s the best out there at the moment and Chelsea deserve the best.
‘Well if I cant win with this club i can always buy that other great club ‘UFC’ and win the world cup with them’ Todd Boehly probably
Madrid didn't even get out of 2nd gear over the two games
"highlighights"
Spend £600m, don’t get a top striker, this is the result
Kindda shows the mentality of the board putting Lampard in, as a player a winner and legend at Chelsea, as a manager woefully shocking, great pay day though for 12 weeks graft, all he has to do is Europa league spot and hey ho success
If only chelsea had invested this season they'd be flying 😂
For how they destroyed football with their signings this year its fully deserved what is happening to Chelsea.😊
Where is Zeyach? That's what Chelsea deserves when neglecting and dumping talent. Lampard brought Zeyach to Chelsea but now he cannot because he has got directions from the new owners.
Tbf chelsea could of scored like 4 goals city will gut Madrid
How many fans of Chelsea said Chelsea were winning the champions league this year? Delusional lot.
How can a club spend so much money , and not have a striker 😂
Was Robbie savage on the jagers the night before? He's sounds rough as toast 🤣🤣
Chelsea going back to a Mid table team without their sugar Daddy. Will never compete with big clubs like Real.
Lovely to see.
next -  Frank Lampard shoots him self with the air pistol in da dressing room of Chelsea FC to become saint  Frank Lampard - Roger Moore of football......
Yes it's a bad Chelsea run but this Real Madrid team are the best in the World.
Chelsea what a club 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🥳
Well done real Madrid miltao should be red carded last night
Another Premiership team out. Listening to Talk Sport yesterday Madrid were going out.
One of those things Chelsea couldn’t hijack.
Great game ruined by caraghers comentary.
Why did Rodrigo do the Suiii?
Todd’s really got this squad flying! Spent well chosen well and now he’s seeing the fruits of all his labour. What a man.
Lampard is the best when comes to hug and pay respect to Don Carlos !!😂🥂
Very bad result  But I give chelsea Credit they played very well  Only the ball didn't want to go in Still proud of the boys
What kind of idiot plays Gallagher who has absolutely no composure on the ball  instead of Felix😠😠😠😠
Lampard doing what lampard does best. Unbelievable how this man is even considered for any managerial positions.
That Kante effort is schoolground quality. Awful.
Can't finish their dinner and defensively they were poor. Chelsea are terrible right now.
Crazy how bad they are when the money is gone sacking one of the best managers in the world because he had a few bad results they not being relegated look at Liverpool couldn't sack klopp even though he's had a bad season just funny to see 😅😅😅😂
Spanish teams too good for English football!!🥂
@Chelsea FC ... game over man, game over.... will we see this club slowly slide down to relegation straits??? Second goal buildup - total humiliation for the club... it's like playing FIFA 23 in beginner mode!
I don’t get how people can waste so much money.   Those tickets are expensive and they walk out with 15 min to go.
Everyone going on about Chelsea needing a Striker. Sure, but everyone seems to be overlooking a fundamental. Chelsea could have Haaland, they would still be doing nothing as they don't have a decent Goalkeeper. They need a striker AND a goalkeeper in the Summer. Kepa gives his defence zero confidence. He is garbage and shouldn't be playing at this level.
Did anyone expect Chelsea to go through before the 1st leg? Let alone comeback from 2-0 down
Result was never in doubt even before the first leg was played. Was never going to happen.
Anyone seen Mudryk?!?!? 🤣🤣🤣
...any legacy the man had...is gone !
At least Frank Lampard has a 5 out of 5 in something. Aka Losses😂😂😂
How was Don Carlo ever the Everton manager?
Chelsea defending for the first goal was shocking
Unlucky chelsea
🍼🍾🍼🍾🍼🍾🍼 it again!
Enzo what a waste of money kante up front ffs😢
Defensively Chelsea try to defend as individuals not as a unit but looked sharper then usual at creating chances just no one clinical enough at all
Wrong goalkeeper for Chelsea.
I think we can all agree that Chelsea have had this coming for a while.
Waiting for the chalobah sliding memes. 😂😂
No one saw rod hit the siii 😂
I hope Lampard gets new contract
Kante playing as a striker says a lot
I am not a Chelsea fan but the issues appear to be on the pitch and not with the Manager.  Some players want out, well, let then go and start afresh. Chelsea should never be that far down the league table
Well done lampard 😅
Never mind eh ? Back to the tattoo parlour and the barbers today boys.
Hala Madrid ⚽️ 🇪🇸 💙 💪 ❤️ 💛 ⚽️
Rodrigo doing the suiiii bring so much nostalgia
Keep lampard he's a genius
Lampard is doing a great job, the gift that keeps on giving. Give this man a 10 year contract 😂😂😂😂
Well they monstered us at Liverpool,so I'm not surprised they stuffed Chelsea.
Still see someone doing the Sui at Real Madrid
Let's go Real Madrid!!!
Valverde is on another level. What a player. 💎
Real Madrid just too street smart and wise. Never ever was they losing last night. There european kings for a reason. Winner of real Madrid and I assume man city semi final win the champions league but a Milan derby will be good to see
Coutouis is the best keeper at the moment
leeds need lampard 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Franks “unacceptable chelski performance” after the last defeat really fired up his clowns 🤡 😅
No way bro did the Sui💀
Chelsea have a team full of egos who are there for money. They are not a team. The yanks don’t know what they’re doing.
*BEAUTIFUL* 😊
If Luka modric leads Real madrid to another Champions league title. He will officially cement his legacy as the greatest midfielder of all time beating the likes of Zidane, Xavi, Iniesta and Platini.
nobody gonna talk abt the sui??
Yes poor from Chelsea but no getting away from that performance from Madrid. Valverde take a bow
Strong performance by Chelsea . Sad to see the result
Lampard consistently loosing,great job!
City Vs Real Madrid in the final 🏆
So happy like bout time they are cheats buy all best players then wreck then the list goes on look at all good players when they left Chelsea club is a joke
Clearly the owners pep talk had the desired effect
even tho chelsea lost kepa didn't have a bad game
Good job the season is not longer, super Frank may have got them relegated 😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Played ok but desperately need a proper striker what the hell is going on
Soooo what has Lampard done since getting Everton relegated ?
It’s like Frank never left. 😂😂😂
Isn't Tuchel better than Lampard?
Fat frank is utterly useless
Real Madrid never left second gear, they could've turned on the style but were content with just putting in a solid performance
Chelsea needs to bring Drogba back even though he is retired and 40 plus years old.  He will score goals that's for sure.
Super , super Frank super frankly limpard😂😂😂😂😂😢
The siuuu celebration made me laugh I guess he'll start doing it cause CR7 got a new celebration
Not harsh on lamps. Chelsea Sohould have score
😂
Gg ranaoa
Èeeeeeeeee
What amazing HiGhligHightS!
Man ne did the suiii  !!!!!!!!
Those silly little blue flags are cringeworthy
Wonder if Boehly realises it wasnt Potter to blame yet?
EPL…the best league in the world…  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤡🤡🤡🤡
I mean... people laughing at Chelsea because of how bad they've fallen but it is Real Madrid.. Arsenal, back in the champs league!....will get piped 4-0 in these games next year probably 👀
Frank Lampard is an awful manager. Chelsea post Abramovich is an awful club. What a shambles. Banter FC.
Does Lampard think he's Pep Guardiola with that lineup?
Loving the Todd and frank close ups 😂
Boehl out
Some of Chelseas signings have been ridiculous.  The Fernández deal particularly
Imagine having to edit out "made in South Africa" 😂
Why was Kante playing as a striker most of the game..
Real Madrid vs Manchester city again
😂😂😂😂 Too easy for Madrid!
An absolute no brainer
Super Frank
I will never pay to have to listen to McManaman. What a melt.
chelsea will not play in europe next season
Chelsea played good for 50 mins ? Then got picked off by Madrid . Cucherela,Sterling and others are awful players.
Hala Madrid!!
Todd Boehly is going to go down as a Legend in 'Old Larndon Town'   Yee - Haa 🤠 🤡
football fans are thick as fk, how can people blame lampard for this
No shame in losing to Real, they are the club and the team everyone else aspires to be.
Chelsea are magic ….. just watched them disappear from the CL 😂😂😂😂
I thought Chelsea would score one goal
Surprised they wasn’t swapping shirts after 😅
Chelsea could hire anyone on the street as manager and it is certain his win ratio will be higher than Lampard.
What are all these criticism for ? - - it's a game the better team won that's what it is -
Well done, Real Madrid getting the win 🏆
Kante as a striker?
Shame...shoulda been 3 0 up by half time....
The little blue flags 😂😂😂
Militao is the best cb in the world. What a player
This owner literally is dogwater I want him gone n also Cucasmella should’ve left with graham snotter 😡😡😡😡
Clownrella
Cucurella if he gave ball to Kante it would be a goal
Why does this commentator always SHOUT the players name or the LAST WORDS OF SENTENCE.
I love how rogrygo waited till the keeper came and blasted the ball in the goal😂❤🇧🇷
Love these dumb yanks taking Chelsea back to the pound land days !! 😂😂
Wow what a manager Lampard is!
Chelsea have the players. Every player has more to give. They lack confidence and need that fear of a top manager. Lampard and potter don’t command respect
😂😂😂
Get ready for city. Is time to revenge 🔥
Chelsea literally playing without a striker 😂 they had good chances, if they had a striker on they maybe could’ve scored some, emphasis on maybe.
anybody notice 3:41 rodrygo's celebration?
Right now Chelsea couldn't even finish a dinner!
Suuuuuuuuiiiiiiiii !!!!!
I just started making YouTube videos. Does anyone have advice on how I can improve?
I think Man City will puncture the Real Madrid balloon in the semi's the way Madrid played. City are a team on a Champions League mission
Chelsea the 🤡 club. So bad
Chelsea thought it was a good idea to a give a previously sacked manager the job again. Just because he was a good player at Chelsea but he’s out of his depth at this level, he should go get some real experience in the lesser leagues, complete joke…
CHELSEA RENT BOY CHELSEA RENT BOY!.....youre just a dirty chelsea rent boy
Klopp should take Kanye n koulibaly, what a nightmare for the latter signing for Chelsea, Maybe Eddie Howe should take half of them too
Should have just spent the £600m buying the entire Brighton team and backroom staff 😂. Then sold the old Chelsea team and staff on ebay to recover something back lol. Brighton play some amazing football. I'm sure Brighton would have given Real a better game than Chelsea have done over both legs.
i  like real madrids gel in there team it was like it wasn't bought in one season
Chelsea came on the pitch with 5 defenders and 2 defensive midfielders, its as if they where the team ahead, and needed to keep the lead, 30 minutes left and lampard finally brings on wingers, what an absolute dunce of a manager
Bro what is happening to Chelsea??! I mean they only lost 2-0 but they’re whole club in every aspect just looks dead. It’s like the players have 0 passion to play for this club and it shows. They’re attacking is awful cannot score to save their life. I know Liverpool are not the best rn either I’ll admit that but atleast we’re scoring goals making games come down to the wire, excitement etc and the feeling of coming back and confidence is there for us especially after our 6-1 win 👊🏼🔥
Really hope Madrid get beat semis another team deserves the trophy for a change 😂😂
Lampard is out of his depth, he was out of his depth at Everton, how was this gonna be any different, silly decision to appoint him even if he's only the caretaker
Why Ziyech is not In At all from the beginning....???    Chelsea happy days is all over baby.... ???
I rather have lampard then potter. Cmon franky make it work❤️
Sack tuchel n go for lampard?? This the results
SIUUUUU W Rodreygo
Chelsea are actually a disgrace, Todd broke the toy, all he had to do was sit back put up the money! He something made easy for him so hard. Fools and there money
THIS IS FOOTBALL H’ERITAGE  …. - Jose Mourinho
Reece James is one of the most overrated players I’ve seen. Bro actually does nothing but have attitude and think he’s hard. If he wasn’t English he’d be another Cedric.
Training session for Real.
Chelsea need a world class striker and to build around them. These highlights show kante playing really far up the pitch lol why is he having all these chances?
Real Madrid play football like it's Chess
Chelsea, how not to buy a football club. An Amazon documentary coming soon.🤣🤣❤
Spent 600M+ and didn’t buy a striker. Then wonder why they can’t score 😂😂😂😂
Doesn't matter if it's Potter or Lampard, no manager can make the players take the chances. Fun fact: in 2023 so far, Chelsea have had 217 shots in the Premier League & 41 so far (total) in the UCL against Dortmund & Madrid. In those 16 Prem games & 3 UCL games before this one, they have scored (in 2023) 13 goals.   So, this year, Chelsea are averaging 20 shots per goal. Their season average of shots "on target" per game is 4, and their shot conversion rate for the season is 5.6%.  As Thierry Henry has said, it's up to the manager to get the ball up to the final third, but it's up to the players to do what needs to be done to get the ball in the net.
That kante miss was criminal  To not even get it on target is unbelievable
Lampard is not the guy as an arsenal fan its real madrid, its no shame tbf
American owner..knows nothing about football...no passion for for football ...only passion for the Benjamins...🤔..
I thought people were exaggerating, but Chelsea really are dreadful.
Chelsea should of won 4-1 to many shots /chances wasted and poor defending on the 1st goal of madrid
People blaming lampard he's the interim manager this bunch wouldn't play for anyone.
I honestly don't know for the life of me why Chelsea got Lampard back in after his abysmal managerial record previously with Chelsea it's like replacing a leaky pipe with another leaky pipe not gonna fix the problem 🤣
Last goal is so humiliating
No money. no honey , is so sad , that football is about money
I just feel after watching this that Chelsea are just a “£100m striker” away from being just as average as Bournemouth 😭🤣
Suiiiiiii 🐐
Man I love Rodryoooo
3:25 look how fast his legs are moving its like he's in fast forward
Just love how unselfish these Real Madrid players are. The team comes first.  The ball is always passed to the player who is better placed to score . That’s the trademark of a great side . All their goals look well rehearsed .
It would make my day to see Chelsea relegated, it could happen if they lose at least 6 of their remaining 7 games and results do not go their way.  Funny how thiago silva just gave up for the 2nd goal 😁
Why i dont understand why edouard Mendy doesnt start?
At least Liverpool managed to score against Madrid..
madrid will get slapped by man city this chelsea team is a mess and thats being kind
get it up ye Chelsea, deserved
We need clips of Chelsea players actually scoring goals in Chelsea training sessions because WTF😭😭
If these 8 year contracts don’t work out Chelsea are going to find themselves in an FFP audit nightmare.
I’m not a Chelsea fan but Real Madrid scored the most deadest goals I’ve ever seen
They might as well stick someone from the academy up front
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Chelsea missed there chamces and paid the price there, fookin classic
kante being chelsea’s best attacking player really says something😂
Kante hits more shots tonight than Chelsea have in years
Lmao they cut out McManaman saying the 2nd goal was 'made in South Africa' 😂😂
Who can clean this mess now? Chelsea needs a ruthless manager, that manager needs time & full authority to build a team of character with identity.
Tiago Silva is Chelsea's best attacking player.
27:00 is wrong according to opta that vinicius shot wasn't on target, so I want it edited out of the highlights footage
Chelsea have no strikers
More evidence that the Premier League is overrated,another PL team knocked out before the semi final stage. Amen.
They need a striker 😂
Credit to Gallagher in spite of the loss, the man's workrate is something chelsea need and underappreciate.
Horrible defending going to ground for the first goal
The look on the owners of Chelsea priceless  lmao 😂
Madrid taking a pissed of them hahajajahja    Good job Lampard hahaahhah
Guys don t be surprised if real wins again the trophy.
extremely poor
Real Madrid are a different level when it comes to the Champions League. They completely dominated both legs. Chelsea spent all that money and didn't think about signing a good striker. Chelsea's finishing is awful. Every shot was either a miss or straight at Courtois.
A win made in Uganda
Rodrygo would have been getting his ankle snapped on that second goal. Disrespectful
Frank thinks he's playing golf...trying to get to lowest score possible. Let's hope his genius continues!🤞
Why is Kante playing so far forward? Wheres Felix, Auba etc
chelsea fans leaving the stadium says everything
Tuchel was where they went wrong
Rodrigo Suii
Just great to see Chelsea knocked out!
Lets not forget Chelsea just spent half a Billion Pounds 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why did kapa watch the 1st goal go in 😂😂😂 if he dived , he would of saved it 😂😂😂
Hala Madrid ❤️ Rodrigo 😻
Rodrygo : remember me
i hope chelsea get expelled from the prem and go to the MLS
Roman is laughing.
Has Frank won a 🎮 game yet.. Chelsea are on relegation form
They deserve this they went from 1 failure to another 🎉🎉 by choosing average managers 😂😂
Madrid into the semi in trying to reclaim their European Crown back.
The Chelsea fans thought they acc had a chance 😂😂😂
I’m surprised that Chelsea came this far in the competition
its so good to see rodrygo copy his idol
Siuuuuu
Amount of money on the pitch one person can't score wow
Real Madrid absolutely clinical in front of goal whereas Chelsea absolutely diabolical in front of goal.
Go on Super Frank, hahahahaha
Chelsea 0 were well beaten again tonight
hala madriid
that Ronaldo celebration had me in tears, that celebration looks exactly like it is on Fifa lol
How chelsea didn't score is incredible so many chances
Real Madrid is the best football club in the world 😊
Lampard won’t last the next 8games
Valverde - super player
Kante has to score 1 of those
Why Frank lampard came back I do not no  He wasn’t great with Everton so what do u do u go to even more a bigger club 😅😅
Why was Kante playing no.9 🤣🤣
Valverde is a beast 💪
Seems like the only team who can stop Real are City
Even though we lost, I still think we created some good chances. There were some promising signs.
lampard so desparate to get in the championship . club is built on artificial money let it happen :)
Joa felix to utd
Valverde is such a baller. Pretty sure Madrid got him for like 10 million 🤯🤯
To all the haters out there here is a message man city will beat real madrid this time my prayers are accepted ameen respect 💯💯💯💙💙💙
ha ha ha
Cruise is a very harsh word, Chelsea dominated the game but as always can’t score
Why on earth is Kante playing the highest up of a midfield three? These Chelsea managers aren't even picking the team I know...
fat frank get sacked twice from the same club XDDDD
Kante though, hahaha
We can talk about unbelievably close Jeff missed chances in matches until the end of time, but if a defence is flawless in a match, most teams would have a hard time
These man can’t even get a draw, it’s only £10.😂
The way Chalobah just watches Rodrygo just run off and jogs back while admiring his goal 🤦🏾‍♂️
Real...ballers man joy to watch.. Chelsea finished this season
Real such a classy outfit . Talent all over . Brazilian lads are a constant threat 🥶
@5:17 was there a fire drill? 👀
dno what the bt commentators where smoking madrid never left 2nd gear that whole game
Ask yourself this. Would Potter have done any worse? Was it really worth sacking him before the end of the season?
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Who dont wanna be like little Frankie gettin all the top jobs... then gettin fired coz of little lack of ideas and then off to the next top job 😂👌👏i mean hat off to little frankie 🎉🎩   The moment i watched him being "THE MAN" gettin all aggressive toward Klopp i knew right there and then Karma will get that bwoy and he wont be a very fruitful manager 😂 i knew it right there and then tellin Klopp and co to relax and shut up coz Klopp only has one league title 😂🎉
Todd Boehly is already prepping for next season by sending scouts to watch all burnley Targets in hopes of winning the Championship
Chelsea fans deserve worse for getting rid of abromovich over politics.
The prides loose 2day shame 😅
At least one real Madrid player respect Ronaldo 😊 Suiiiiii
Is there any special training given to Chelsea players to miss easy chances
Lampard at the wheel dear god
city real madrid again lets hope its better than last year
As a poodle fan I hurt more,cos we were 2 up against them , then we switched off, and showed them to much respect. And the players let us down, I don't want Madrid to win it again fed up of them.
Full Brazil frontline next year. Vinicious. Endrick. Rodrygo
Can someone let lampard know he's allowed to win a game 😂
Super Frank may aswell stick himself up front 😂 he would have buried some of these chances.
Oh no. Anyway
3:42 SUIIIIII
Can’t believe I watched my team Madrid beat Chelsea live at Stamford bridge 😭🤍🏳️
Pride of London 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I still can't stop laughing at boehly saying that chelsea would win 3-0😂
Lampard shouldnt be let anywhere near a PL club until hes properly established himself at Championship level and actually learns how to manage a team.
Chelsea played really well even though they got beat probably the best performance under Frank
Bruh it’s Real Madrid vs Chealse come on now it’s too easy
Played 4, Lost 4, Scored 1, Conceded 7. May Lampard continue at Chelsea 😂😂
Look guys I know he lost every game but who cares because he knows the club 😂
Lampard might as well get on the pitch and get a few passes in at this rate
Steve mcmanaman is such a tool
Man city might win the champions league this year
At this point we need Frank back on the pitch
I genuinely mean this but what effect does constantly losing games have on your mental health and confidence? I really feel bad for lampard he shouldnt hage taken this role even if its temporary
Chelsea played well but courtois too good and there finishing too bad
That rodriygo wants to learn about showing some respect and class. That second goal was unnecessary and should of just put it in instead of teasing the keeper from there. Wonderful player though
Real Madrid players and fans are asking: “How the hell do they have 600 mill to spend with a sh*t stadium like this?” 😂
Real Madrid best team ever in Champions league
Chelsea had chances, just seem allergic to the area between the sticks. How the 600m wasn’t used for a decent CF is criminal.
Khazar cursed lampard
Worst commentators ever...
Who’s here to check the shot on target
People talk about Messi and Ronaldo and rightly so, but of all the players I've seen in over 50 years of football the first name on my teamsheet would be Modric.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Change my mind, Kepa should be sold!
I wonder what Felix is thinking. Would he rather stay at Chelsea next season, or return to Athletico?
Even their stadium is outdated.
I said it from the beginning that Chelsea new ownership because of wokeness... is the end of chelsea as we remember it in the last 20 years. They will be in deep financial troubles
What moron thinks Lampard is good for Chelsea..jeez Everton thought he was a joke...possibly one of Chelsea's worst ever signings and we have had a few!
how lampard gor hired by chelsea again baffles me. hed struggle even in the championship
Can someone please confirm that Junior does have a shot on target which the keeper saves in the 27th min (roughly)
“3-0 incoming”  -   Todd boehly     No Todd it’s 4-0
Man City gonna smash Madrid in final
Pin 📌 this “Rodrygo, The future Brazilian Legend for sure”✔️
LAMPARD!!! 🤡🤣🤣🤣🤣
'PRIDE OF LONDON' 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Rodrygo’s scoring both goals and celebrating like a toxic fifa players
Those short interplays between the Madrid players have been a joy to watch in this UCL. By far the best team in the competition.
And to this day I still get round why Tuchel was sacked
Give cranky time, he’s a Chelsea legend he knows what’s best.
Deprelsea
Optastats recorded vini jr as having no shot on target despite his highlight here. Shocking
I blam the struggling chelsea form on ukrainian people .
city will bury them and win the treble best club side in world football.
Chelsea recruitment: just pay the release clause. Chelsea board: done. And that lady's and gentlemen is how not to do business in the Premier league.
Good bye champion league   good bye fa cup  good bye carabaw cup  good bye PL
What does he think chalobah tried to do?? He went to take him out ffs
The demise of Chelsea
1 goal in 6 games for Chelsea
That second goal was like watching a pro fifa gamer
0-0-4 For Lampard incredible
Siuuuuuuuuu😂
Ahhh what a day 😂😂😂
Suiii
chelsea starting to be like tottenham
Over half a billion and can't get a win 😂😂😂😂 I'm dying 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lampard should just take up cooking or something at the point
Fun fact: Chelsea done better against Real Madrid than Liverpool 😅😅😅
Lol, special things happen at Stanford bridge indeed
Give Lampard time, Chelsea played well tonight.
Is Kante an attacking midfielder now?
I can't wait for Manchester City to face Real madrid
Just signed valverde for next season in my championship manager 0102 man td saved game just what I need to get rid of Fred 👌🏻
Rodrygo shows respect to Cristiano! Im truly happy to see that :) Hasta el final vamos Real!
Lampard is proving to be the worst manager ever
Chelsea used to be known for their power . Players like Terry , Drogba , Anelka , Ballack (to name but a few ) . Now they just have these twinkl toe players that have no substance to them .
Chelsea need Jose to come home.
I’m pretty sure modric is gonna go down as the most consistent central/attacking midfielder of all time.
They didnt play that bad and had some good chances..but its the same story this season where they cant put the ball in the back of the net regardless of how many chances they get Defensive mistakes were bound to happen and i wasnt expecting them to win. Lampard just needs to put the best squad out every game to see the season out and hopefully get some points because this has been embarrasing. The lack of goals, the injuries, the stupid signings, no real striker, players underperforming and flopping, 3 managers, no foundation or plan to build towards..a complete empty shell of a team right now. End the season off with some dignity and then focus on the usa pre season to actually crunch down on real problems and solutions
Another Wankard masterclass 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Special things can happen at Stamford Bridge................................... Hahahahahah Chelsea in the mud
All that money spent 😂😂😂😂
Chelsea just need to spend another 500 million to sort that mess out.
1:23 how isn’t that a vini jr shot on target
4 games in and frank's still waiting for his first win/draw
That first goal was avoidable. Fofana panicked and left vini and took out Silva in the process.
Lampard is at the wheel.
Love these Highlighightightsightsightsights
no striker and only kante and james any good in defence.
vini jr had a shot on target
*I Got An Advert About Google And I Thought It Was The UCL Anthem* 💀💀💀    𝓗𝓲
City will batter Real Madrid in the semi final.
3:59 Frank searching new jobs on Reed
Fede valverde for the second goal was pure filth. Tore them apart ❤
Taxi for Frank Lampard please
Madrid city and possibly a Milan derby for the semis this ucl has been great 👍
Every single Chelsea chance yet I knew they wasn't going to score. Kante ain't that guy especially as he's recently back from injury and they actually have no striker.
Rodrygo with the Sui lol
Lampard for England..
Lampard got 1 point from his last 9 Everton games and now 4 straight losses at Chelsea- great manager!
And they say Ole was just vibes 😂
We've got super frank Lampard! He know what rival fans need! Cucu at the back James Charles in attack Chelsea getting out of premier league!
Madrid and Man City favourites.
So much for Todd B and his rallying cry.....
ancelotti is definitely one of the best coaches ever, don't want him to retire, i had a feeling they can still win it
Highlight of the match for me was hearing the commentator scream "made in South AFRICA" when referring to Valverde, Rodrygo & Vinicius
So basically, City v  Real will be a two leg final.
Madrid making in to 11 semifinals in the last 13 years is crazy
Fofana the striker Chelsea signed where is he?
I’m a Chelsea fan and I know now what to do Let’s support Bayern or Real Madrid until the end of the season which both have quality managers and know where the players need to be in the lineup
I was tempted to sub myself on at half time hahah no but serious Ryan Reynolds wouldn’t give me a job at the minute I am bad
Rodrygo hit the SUIII, classic Madrid player 😂
1st goal is fofana fault, didn’t keep track on vini jr and 2nd goal is mudryck losing his man, these youngsters are a joke
Basically Frank Lampard played an ultra defensive lineup and formation in a game at home, they had to win by at least two goals. Says it all. Absolutely clueless
City vs Madrid should be for the winners 🏆 but I just have a feeling that Italy will have the winner this season.
I was a big fan of Chelsea many years but now I don't know wtf ....
Fat Frank the gift that keeps on giving! 🤡
Cucarella just needs red hair and it's Krusty the 🤡
I think Kepa forgets he has hands sometimes.
Cucurella is abysmal x
Lampard is actually a trashy manager.
Fat frank
Time for your weekly visit to Harrods for ice cream
That second goal was out of order 😂
Wait. Help please. Who drew the save from Kepa at 1:30?
Pain. Nothing else to say except pain
Beat Loserpool ans chelski home away 😂😂 imagine Real Madrid in premier league they win the league unbeaten every year
If Mount wants some CL football next year we will take him up in Newcastle.
19 years of supporting Chelsea I’ve never been more disappointed than the current squad I have. I have even lost the excitement of watching football. I found myself watching UFC more now
🤣🤣🤣🤣
EMBARRASSING THE PREM FFS. DEAD WOOD ARAENAL WILL BE IN CL NEXT SEASON BEAT THESE BOYD FOR ENGLAND
Real Madrid: Can do attitude ×Positive = team player
Chelsea are absolutely shocking 🤣🤣🤣
Anyone that blames lampard needs a big violent slap! The PLAYERS are absolutely TRASH!!!!!
Very happy but city game will be so hard it's like the final if we beat city there's nobody stoping us winning it again let's just hope ❤️ hala Madrid
This would of never happend under Abramovich should of never made him sell the club
Real Madrid are beatable they’re just lucky there’s a decline in football at the moment. Top teams are going through a rough patch. Real are a dying squad who are ever so slowly rebuilding. Most of their players are heading towards retirement.
Chelsea actually played well in the 1st half that's the sad thing😢
INEVITABLE!!!!…. The Chelsea owners are 🥴
Final real madrid vs Ac milan
Do Chelsea ever score?
Honestly it’s time to bring back the special one.
Expected result 👍
Chelsea have gone from Mourinho telling Imbramovic “get me Drogba. Don’t speak. Just get him” to Boehly giving the team talks with Lampard hahaha 😂
3:40 XD lol that celeb
hala madrid
That second goal was disrespect 😂🤣…. Pure fifa jeggle
😂😂banter f.c still cant buy a goal lol 600 million spent in 6 months and they never look like scoring
Hala Madrid  Coolness under pressure 🎉
This is great, this oil no history club is going down the drain.  Love to see it.
Chelsea's terrible season continues, might be awhile before they play champions league football again
The way chelsea should have been 2-0 up in the first half is crazy
What was James doing walking at 3:33, if he carried on running, would've blocked the pass. Smell the danger. And then mild jogging at 5:32. Sell.
What a shameless and pathetic performance by Chelsea’s Team tonight against Real Madrid ok   Lampard should leave tomorrow morning ok not helping at all especially with his tactics playing Gallagher before Felix and Sterling shame isn’t it    Clueless management from Lampard
Chelsea is getting battered ever day
Chelsea's last Ever Game in Europe.
That dummy run where Vinicius picked up the ball for the 2nd goal was brilliant football IQ
Them 3 slags on Bt Sport  Ferdninand  Joey Cole and that  Muppet  Owen wouldn't  criticise their  Mate Fat Frank.
A new manager appointment needs to happen urgently 😢😢
'L'ampard
Potter all day long!!!
Well it try and get the Conference League now.
The fact that Todd said that Chelsea would win 😂😂😂
Real Madrid players are so selfless
where is FELIX?
Real Madrid are playing the champions league mode on beginner mode look at those sweaty goals 😂🤣
Chelsea also known as Tottenham Hotspur
Chelsea should bring Cashley out of retirement. Gotta be better than Cucurella.
💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉
Rodrygo making the siuuu celebration is gonna send send them to the champions league final
How have chelsea not scored 1
Horrendous managerial showing from Lampard once again. 100% defeat rate still going strong
At this point I just wait to see how many goals chelsea will lose by
Real Madrid weren’t even trying and they still won
Who to sack next? Ball boy maybe?  Disaster class from Chelsea management
Rodrigo is like a clone vinicius
🤡🤪🤡
Not bothering to show the red card or..?
Proof that money cant buy happieness
I'm not big on either AC Milan or Real Madrid but anything to stop Man city from winning it
I love when he did the sui
Madrid to win it again and that's coming from a United fan.
Not Lampard's fault, if given the job permanently - with stability he'll do a super job
Kante and Cucurella could have made the difference
My word Chelsea are doo doo
Calm down everyone it was only Chelsea.
Rodrygo trolling the $h!t out of Kepa before the 2nd goal lol. Love it 😂
Is a Lampard masterclass
They even cut out the part when one of the commentators mentioned Vini Jr and Rodrygo were “South African” lol
STOP PUTTING THE SCORELINE IN THE VIDEO TITLE
I must say that Real Madrid are the best team in the world better than any other teams around the continent.
Seeing Rodrygo doing the siuuuu to dedicate the goal to his idol was nice to see :)
So there's a very good chance now the Emirates will be the only stadium in London to host CL football next season.. not many would have predicted that at the start of this season eh.
Todd Bohley what's the score? Lol😂
The Spanish slay the English lions again lol Last season Real Madrid knocked out the so called big guns Liverpool, Chelsea & Man City, so far this season Liverpool & Chelsea knocked out, Man City will be next  The Spanish are superior over little England 🤣
Franks going be a popular Halloween costume this year
I thought Chelsea would struggle post Abramovich but I never expected them to be this bad. Sacking Tuchel is one of the worst decisions any premier league club has made. They've spent hundreds of millions and gone massively backwards
Actually shocked. Had a £500 bet on Chelsea to win 5-0. Oh well.
Cucurella miss😂 Mudryk miss😂 What a shambles of a team - misfits
Chelsea fans missing the Benitez days right now
The second goal tho. Kepa thought he could really save that 😂
Another lampard masterclass 😂
Super Frank to the rescue 😂😂  Your golden years are done, lads, heading back to being an also ran like you's were before big Romans Rubles.  Get it fu***ng round you's, Chelsea mugs 😂😂😂😂😂
Haaland is gonna need to score a hattrick vs RM
if chelsea have players that can finish they win this game plain and simple dominant display but no end product
Potter was the problem 😂
Hope Madrid lift it again 👌🏻
They were calling MADRID lucky😂😂😂
End this season already we need a year or 2 out of Europe and to rebuild . Why on earth did  we not start mudryk or our strongest 11?
As a United fan Madrid is my only hope🙏
Kante wtf
The second goal from rodrygo was disrespectful
Modric must have been a pro for at least 125 years now at least.. the man just never even seems like stopping
A moment of silence for those Chelsea fans who were confident in beating Madrid this time just because they played away first this time. Manchester City might be a different story as they're in form and a lot stronger but Madrid have shown that they are capable of beating the best before
Congrats madrid
🎶 "One man went to laugh, went to laugh at Chelsea" 🎶
That Todd boehly has never kicked a football in his life!
Lampard left Everton in the relegation zone and destroyed his own club. TWICE 😂
Frank's at the wheel!💩💩
As much as I love Real Madrid and Rodrigo I hope he never does the Suiii again 😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Chelsea really got schooled Real Madrid are elite elite elite
Rather prefer appointing Patrick Vieira than lampard
Ucl Night? Madrid's night
The usual, couldn't finish dinner served on a plate and we just crumble.
Frick I don’t want us to play madrid man we got clapped last season that was enough to give me cardiac arrest
Great semi finals ahead of us
Lampards strongest performance. Chelsea just cannot put the ball in the back of the net. An overspending transfer window that left no attacking force worthy of scoring goals.
rodrigo replicating ronny makes me realise how old i’m getting
Mudryk needs a proper psychologist, poor lad is too nervous on that pitch.
If chelsea could finish this would have been a very different game - can only blame themselves
Lampard 007  We will be there
4 Game 4 lose for Lampard as Chelsea’s manager the worst
Fair play, Chelsea and Lampard are proper good 🤥🤥🤥🤥
Lampard shows nepotism will always has its place.
Lol
Second
HALA MADRID!!!
First
Whoever takes over at Chelsea next season doesn’t need to get new players they need to sell some & get the team spirit back because Chelsea looked defeated from minute 1 tonight
"At least we can look forward to the battle for 10th now am I right" "No but seriously, our season is done now"
Well done Madrid! Only they can save football now from being destroyed by the pathetic cheating plague of blue Manc plastics!  Go again in the semi!
Lamps going for the 100 percent record of losses
Lampard soooooo clueless
Tbh RM felt like they barely tried. But they will still win cl
real madrid owns england tbf
Chelsea are now in rebuild mode it will be a long time until we see them back were we was. this is coming form a Chelsea fan
Chelsea’s starting 11 was absolutely terrible tf type of starting 11 was that
I’m just going to consider this season a write off. Just want it to be over asap. Can’t bear this anymore.
Proper Chels😉
I’m just waiting for angry rant man’s reaction now
Rodrygo owns Chelsea
Real Madrid vs City semi final last season was iconic but it would’ve been nice for an all English & all Italian semi final would’ve been unique
👍👍👍👍👍
Lampard in!
Embarassing
Hala Madrid! City vs Madrid is going to be an insane game!
What an achievement for Frank Lampard. An 100% defeat rate is not easy going
Another day, another defeat for Chelsea
As an Everton fan, I'm loving these strong Lampard performances
First
Were we ever expecting a different result 😂
Lampard gonna be the first 007 manager 😭😭
How much more can Chelsea get humbled with their owners 🤣
worst season for chelsea ever !! so awful to watch
HALA MADRIDDDDD❤❤❤❤
IT'S the history of the Chelsea
