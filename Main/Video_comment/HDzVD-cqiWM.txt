you could've used the Shimadzu HPV-X2 for 10 mil fps
I haven't watched ElectroBOOM at all. Is his shtick just to be a proper expert while still somehow also being incompetent? Because that's what he displayed here.
2:59 “I mean I have touched it.” We sure seen that you have. Many times.😭
i love that Mehdi is here to crunch the numbers to truly understand more about electricity as opposed to all the other videos that are just to look cool
8:42 ITS WHAT
8:41 67
Please record a capacitor discharge spark (green flash etc), and repeat with inductor in the discharge path, physical discharge wire to wire no electronic switching.
I do same the same stuff as bectroloom. I'm fine thanks
Y'all might want to check out styropyro and his lasers
Love the video, but now my brain hurts from listening to this fella doing the math for the resonance frequency on the fly. 😂
ngl Its beautiful man 😮😍
4:19 Harry Potter and the prisoner of Electroboom 😂
Clear and simple, well done.
Now I want to see a tesla coil with a fan blowing on it
8:45
11:19 I kind of thought so.
8:45 I was just thinking about 6 7 also *_6 7(77...)_*
5:20 or just increase the exposure time 💔💔
ik yall probably figured out long ago why this all happens, but i wanted to put my thoughts out-  I think the reason it's all simultaneous, and why it happens from the final one, is because that completes the loop. my thought is that it's like a dam, building up with electrons until finally, there's enough energy built up to allow ALL of the connections to be made. the final one connects, and that gives a path for all the electrons to go from positive to negative. they all happen simultaneously because that's the only instant where there's enough power for the electricity to flow.
Nice!
If I understand how the Marx generator works, I would expect the propagation to be close to the speed of light.
Thanks sain
Hallo guys always a pleasure to see ur videos and see whats goingon in the world when everything goes more slow... and definitely enjoy and it helps me to understand more about how everything works in other diferente scale. So i was wondering about.. What it could happen if u do the same experiment if u do it in the vacum space..? Bcuz everyone know taht electricity works different thought the material in earth but i think we never see how it works in the vacum of the space... 🤔 For sure will be an interesting video to watch or think it could be..  😁
16:02 Because when Jesus said “The last shall be first” in Matthew 20:16, He meant it!
4:19
@AlphaPhoenixChannel 1bil Fps camera on marks generator? 12:32
The tesla coil going up in frequency sounds like the DHMIS computer yelling  "Dont touch meEEEEEE!!!*
I learned the little grounding trick from a friend of mine I worked with at a hospital. While delivering plastic wrapped linens to workstations. He taught me that if you held a key in your hand and touched the door knob with the key, the static  charge buildup in your body would " Arc" between the key and the door knob and you would not feel it bite your hand. 👍🏻🕵🏻
Apparently light can travel 150 meters in half a microsecond, so this shot doesn’t have enough resolution
At 16 minutes and 40 seconds, oh there is, really, No…  I don’t know why but they got me that was funny. They seem like cool dudes.
Time for another collab using your 10m fps camera!
3:54 This Image just makes me think of a wizard fighting god
8:12 that reminds me a lot of lightning bolts, I think what's happening, like with lightning bolts, is that, the first charges create a channel of ionized air and flow through it, then some get accumulated in the source before jumping through the same channel, and it keeps going until the channel breaks.  Also, the "fluff" that appears between the Tesla coil and the screwdriver could be the stepped leader from the tesla coil making contact with a streamer from the screwdriver, like with clouds and the ground.
Is it possible to get the frame of the arc in the shot ?
At 13:40 it is the speed of light, what did you expect??? 😂😂😂
the face of ElectroBOOM fell when The Slow Mo Guys said 500k FPS instead of 1.75M FPS got me laughing on the floor 😭😂
Mehdi is so precious
I want an updated version of this video with their fancy new cameras! I want to see electricity at 5,000,000 frames per second!
What would happen if you extended the second expirement to make the setup longer and then filmed the further end portion to see if it still sparked before the rest?
It's mainly Americans that say this. 95%
11:36 The camera and the WHAT?
Hahhaha.. ElectroBOOM and The Slow Mo Guys.. love this collab.. even if it's 2 years old..
Watching the video at 0.5x gave me 3.5M FPS footage🌚💀
Great video. I've worked with high voltage for over 30 years. Just a few notes to add for everyone. An arc is only one portion of what is happening. the streamer stage is what is seen first. You will also see the step leader coming from the other object. Once the step leader streamer connects to another streamer the electron channel in formed and you get the bright arc. The electron tunnel in the air doesn't break down as fast as the tesla coil resonates. This is why the arc path stays relatively the save as the tesla coil resonates. Lightning in slow mo displays the same properties.
Mehdi I am son of chinchu i am your friend
Lightning is an ARC and is relatively slow compared to an A to B power supply voltage. An ARC (Anode, Rectified, Cathode) can be steered between the North and South poles of two magnets or one horseshoe magnet. You can also steer it between two electrodes, one with an abundance of particles of electricity and one with a shortage of particles of electricity.

Marx generator alarm clock
5:25-5:36 straight up siren sounds lol
Would have been interesting if this was also done in a vacuum to see the change.
I did some research on the electricity in our brains, and it turns out we literally have enough energy to literally light a single lightbulb. 20 W of electricity. Our brains are crazy.💀
5:24 ElectroBOOM: UNLIMITED POWER!!!!!!!
It's crazy how slow the arc goes, yet the light information still happens instantly? Is this proof that light is faster than electricity?
Interesting how this video went by as if it was taken by a 0.00000057 fps camera.
Its good to see the electricity was already at both end before we got to see our memory  heat up and cool down
Sounded like Zimos from Saint's Row 😂
Did Dan say testicle rather than tesla coil at 11:38? The subtitles think so
i love the sounds it makes
11:55 YOU CAN DO TEN MILLION NOW! Lets see how fast electricity is!!
Mehdi is a madman!😜
Dan looked like harry potter fighting with his wand
Traditionally Marx generators are triggered from the bottom of the stack. Maybe the upper spark gap was the closest spacing and happened  to trigger first. Try it again but increase spacing of upper gap. Also a mark generator with inductors rather than resistors might yield a ladder breakdown.... due to some resonance.
Please do grapes in a microwave.
I love the sound of a powered-up Tesla coil in the morning!  I saw a demonstration some years ago, in which there was this guy had a number of differently sized Tesla coils, being turned on and off very rapidly (at fairly high frequencies) by a MIDI controller.  This collection of the coils played a TUNE, with different notes coming from differently sized coils, going from low bass frequencies to around 18 or 20 KHz, producing  all the frequencies of a symphony orchestra.  Low bass notes were coming from the biggest coils, and the highest frequencies coming from coils the size of the one in this video and smaller.  Sure, they all produced a square-wavy kind of sound, but the tuning of these distorted guitar sounds, was right on the money!  The machinery had been well tuned, and the arrangement of whatever song it played sounded like ten or twelve outrageously distorted guitars playing a symphony!  It was weird, and the extreme distortion of the sounds fatigued the ear after not many minutes.  However it was pretty amazing.
Dan looks like klay Thomson
This video is exactly what I expected from Youtube and your respective channels. THANKS.
5:55 its the same principle as how lighting forms. You can even see a positive leader on the second metal piece
Remember how in the beginning of this channel, or close to it, there was this video of a shattering teacup and his camera was so slow, it looked like the cracks were instant, then years later, with a new camera we could actually see the crack propagate? Well, here's hoping we can do the same thing here a decade later. Although, looking into how this is done, for what I know (which is very little) we seem to already be pushing the bounds of what's possible. The *really* interesting questions come when we film *faster* than the speed of light. You can in theory do this if you just have enough camera's. If this is done, though, it's going to look different for every camera as the part of the arc closest to the camera will light up sooner than the others, but if you know why "quantum mechanics" is named the way it is, I do wonder if there's a chance we won't get to see even this. Like the universe has a set rate of "frames" So no matter how fast we film, there will always be one frame between no arcs and all arcs. I know it sounds silly. That would imply the speed of light is instant, but the theory of relativity has shown stranger things. Like it being possible to see something happening exactly simultaneously actually change depending on your perspective and/or relative motion. Meaning you can see the left side go off before the right if you travel in one direction, and the opposite if you travel the other direction.
Here is one good question. You guys are deaing with speeds higher than anything we know well. Light speed. Did you consider the how parallel the diode axis was to the camera’s perpendicularity?  Because at these speeds the light source closest to the camera would be seen first. So if it were off in the respective axes you could either align the explosions or badly misalign them assuming that they arent insantaneous and your isnt perpendicularly parallel
16:00 is electron momentum a thing? I would i magine the flow being directed more towards the end would indicate a flow of electrons in one direction. Could that possible direct the order of discharge? Also, if the last diode’s voltage is lower could it mean that it has a better capacity to accept momentum from both directions? Maybe that charge difference causes the leap to happen there first for the fact that it would move more effectively out of the second final gap and the final pole gap? I think of this maybe like diffusion. The last diode has more room for electrons making the bandwidth most like higher.
I can’t even fathom 1,750,000 fps
EVIL SCIENTIST VIBES WHEN HE ASKED "WERE YOU FEELING IT A LOT?" 😂
WHY IS NOBODY DOING THE DOUBLE SLIT EXPIREMENT WITH THIS CAMERA!?!?! oh there's a reason.
The electricity sounds just like the intro to that song Stolen Dance by Milky Chance at 5:04.   Edit: If you set the playback speed to 0.95 and sync this up to that music video, it fits so perfectly. Like the timing of his singing and everything.
so good video, thank you
I have an electrical engineering degree and my main take away is that I'm not messing with electricity. Luckily I also have a mechanical engineering degree. ☮️
Dan rethinks his decision to go first at the start lol
Its a carbon trail, the following arc follows that same carbon trail.  Saw this as a failure many times on an old induction hardening machine.  Any material touched by that carbon trail had to be replaced or it would follow that path really easy
Try this again bare feet on the ground
I wonder if ole Nikola did the zap thing first to himself, or his “friends”?  Would it stand a cat’s fur on end?  Fun gadget guys.  Thanks for the demo.  Must get one and see if I can integrate some laser stuff into the scene.  Would be a disaster if the Tesla beam got into the laser power supply.
INDIVIDUALLY YOU GUYS ARE TOP SHELF, AS A TEAM..  THERE'S NOTHING YOU CANNOT CREATE, DEMONSTRATE, OR DESTROY - I LOVE YOOZ.  @ 500K CPS IT'S A DIRECT CURRENT LINE, SO TO SPEAK.. IT'S NOT A BROKEN OR SCATTERED (FRACTAL LOOKING) CHAIN- SEARCHING FOR ONE 'LEAD' TO CONNECT.. INTERESTING.. VERY CLEAN CONNECTION AT THAT FREQUENCY.. THIS MUST HAVE SOME APPLICABLE, IMPORTANT SPECIFICITY USABLE APPLICATION SOMEWHERE SOMEHOW, YES...?
So what you're saying is, you need a faster, more expensive camera, or you'll lose your names as the slow mo guys? 😅
You could video record a lighting in slowmo, launching a rocket with a cable in a storm, and attach it to different objects.
0:05 whoops a daisy 😬
Being able to visually see the AC frequency was very cool
n here I am playing 1.75M FPS at 0.25X speed
Is the audio here designed in post production?
As soon as it stinks of Ozone, Mehdi is around... To do dangerous things 😂😂😂
Slappy!, lol
I’d love to see you guys try this again with some of the better cameras.
You need a camera that hasn't been invented yet😊
thats amazing ! ! ! !
I really hope this comment on a 2y old video gets your attention. AlphaPheonix did a video on solving a maze with electricity, I bet if you did a combination of long wires and slo mo you could get more info or good visual representations!!!!!
11:36 "so the camera and the testicle aren´t broken" 😂
4:03 there's like a spot on his hand looking like 2500°C very approximately for like 2 frames
BEST COLLAB OF THE CENTURY AND I DIDNT KNOW TILL NOW????
I suspect it's ultraviolet light from the first arc in the Marx multiplier that triggers the next arc gap,  on down the line,  in which case the cascade would proceed at the speed of light.  I'd really like to see high speed footage of a T.E.A.  laser to see how the discharge proceeds down that long arc gap,  I think it might be doing the same thing.   Fascinating video,  guys.
Mehdi knows why to go straight for 1.75M fps, electricity's pretty quick
Electroboom!!!
And it was still not fast enough to resolve the dance of electrons and protons in an electric discharge. Faster! Faster!
Electons travel at the speed of light, curent human technology is curently not able to measre or capture that speed.  This video proves that.
If Tesla could see this.
dude 8:50 sounds like some sci fi scene where someones lost in space and they're alone with just the sounds of the computers.
the "trail" of the ark that the next one follows is most likely Plasma that got formed by the high temps of the arc itself... at least i think so
Does the arc follow the heat or the nitrates made?
https://youtu.be/IAwfV2r7e-A?list=PLFVPKZZ-TL0TWO-fy52IldveHo8njC6uf something you might like, it is slow might want to play it 2x
Mehdi is just the nicest person ever
Watching these guys discover in real time that electricity is fast... is priceless.
Allah's message to atheists. In the Koran Surah (52) at-tur verse 35-36 .It reads.  35. Or were they created without an origin or did they create (themselves)?  36. Or did they create the sky and the earth? Actually they don't believe (what they say).
Why don't you find out about Islam. And you can compare the Quran and the Bible. In Islam, Jesus is a prophet, not a god. And God is one, not three........
what an amazing collaboration.
Electro boom dude naturally funny af 😂😂
You can still watch my speed painting IRL
It’s not a video with electroboom without circuitry explosions
11:10 Heartbeat 🥰
We found that short arcs in normal air can form in less than 6nsec...short, 1mm.  Light travel distance is 1.8M in 6nsec.
What about making the setup 10x longer? That would compare to 17.5M frames
If you notice an arc jumps from the screwdriver and meets the arc from the coil. I saw this years ago with lightning hitting objects, especially the ground. An arc always leaves the intended target and meets the lightning arc.
Go Tom Green!
Mehdi: "You don't believe me?  You WILL, Dan.  You will become a TRUE BELIEVER!"
you are such a guts person to take such a pain
Maybe the direction of flow is the reverse of your theoretical, making it first rather than last. Theoretical current flow is from negative to positive.
0:30 didn’t recognise him at first… Yea you’re definitely getting shocked I don’t think he’s all there… 😂
Great colab!
That is crazy I'd be real curious to know what the speed is
Flashing: done the same with oscilloscope connected to watch voltage and current.   The first bright arc occurs and lasts while the source capacitance can maintain a sufficient voltage difference, then it goes out as the target charges up. In that cycle, the voltage continues to increase igniting another arc. If the target is conductive, it arcs to the same spot. If the target is non conductive, to a spot nearby not yet charged up. This continues to the peak of the cycle.   The voltage reverses and nothing happens as it decreases until it builds up sufficiently in the opposite direction where it also makes multiple arcs and so on.   I am consultant engineer to a company that makes high voltage electrical plasma generators for industry.
The part with the screwdriver is similar to what I do with my car key when I expect static electricity. That moves the spark away from my skin. I also learned to ground myself on wood as an alternative, because it's not the metal that causes it, but me.
If anyone is going to invent warp speed, it’ll be someone in this video
Now, I would like to see a slow mo heat camera for electricity so we might see the ion channels heat signature.
0:08 the hell happened there? Famous last words
i have never seen mahdi so cool and calm ever edit: AND HAPPY
Skip to highlight is the best possible thing in sponsorskip addon for videos that love stalling like every one from slow mo guys
A memory got dug out from the back of my mind and I realized that was the guy where everything on his channel just explodes, and I started laughing my ass off.
When dealing with light you pretty much need a camera able to run at 300 million fps 😂
"Seems like it's running at the speed of light almost!" From what I've read, yes! The wave of electrical energy induction change that we consider "electrical current" in wires can travel at nearly 90% the speed of light! If my math is right from eyeballing the length of ElectroBOOM's contraption around 1/4 meter, your cameras would theoretically need to be about 600 to 700 times faster to actually see it across multiple frames! Which sounds absurd but it's wild to think how close we even are to that!
For the Marx gen, there is a theory that the first gap to fire sends photons to the adjacent gap(s) to increase ionization to trigger it, and so on at or near light-speed, so in theory it looks instantaneous, but this doesn't seem to be supported by what you found! And IMHO Mehdi's channel is generally very entertaining and informative, but unfortunately I can't subscribe because of his jokey attitude to taking likely lethal shocks from a microwave oven transformer. People have died playing with those things.
Dude walking from channel to channel and zaps everyone with static.
The video shows that electricity doesn't take the shortest path. The path current takes through dielectric mediums is ordained by God.
I don’t think my pacemaker would like me taking shots from a Tesla coil.
“Man it’s like we need to be filming in 50,000,00 fps” “Yeah it’s like it’s moving at the speed of light of or something” 😂😂
When you all are low-key geniuses😂
I wonder how many gigabytes that 1.75Mf/s video is
Weird science 🤓
I mean.. oh sugar 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Wow
This is sooooo satisfying
So cool it's. And what's the mean "Lots of empty space between arcs has been removed"  at 2:05. Were some still frames removed?
Wouldn't it be better to shoot with a 360 degree shutter for scenarios like this? It's entirely possible that you missed something happening inbetween frames since you're using a 180 degree shutter here, and because there's no motion then there wouldn't be any motion blur plus the advantage of having twice as much light
"i was shocked, literally" 😂😂😂😂
This has got to be the coolest thing I have ever seen. Definitely one of them for sure and I've seen some very rare and extraordinary things.
"Its almost running at the speed of light!"  i mean...its plasma, practically pure energy, so ya, it IS light XD
Wonderful
ElectroBoom: "Let me check if i can..." *BOOOM*  yeah.... checks out
11:35 "The camera and the testicle aren't broken yet"  CC damn you
Thank you . This redeems the 99% cr....p that fills the rest of newtewb.
I am still a little lost that in two instances it showed the very last capacitor micro arc discharge before either the start of the series OR the discharge arc.  Sort of like saying “I saw the whole race from beginning to end even though I started watching from the second last lap”…
"so the camera and the testicle aren't broken"...  🤔
disappointed u to see wearing LGBT wrist watch belt... 6:15
☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️  i clicked "dont RECCOMEND channel" on electriboom years ago, now I see him but the title didn't give me a heads-up!
The spark comes off the screwdriver to meet the other spark, like they say lightning travels from the ground up also, I don't think anyone noticed lol
Curious people discover things. 😊
10:45 You didn’t put the resolution of the video. U did put the time, frame rate, exposure and shutter angle but not the resolution. It’s 640 x 64.
The quick and easy solution to the shock-pain issue is to use a grounded probe for the arc to jump to.
Спасибо за ролик. Комментарий в поддержку. Дата просмотра: 26.05.2024.
"So the camera and the testicle aren't broken" HAHAHAHAHAHA
The fact that this video is on my birthday is pretty cool!
The viewing audience must know, Are eyebrows a factor here? What  constitutes an eyebrow winner?.. Thickness? or light obscuration?
Respect our privacy   Tnx, Electrons.
POV Gamer that has 1750000 fps and -1750000 ping : My pc about to blow up anyway it play a game ... was everybody so like  so so very slow bro ,But i have great wifi:(
I always feel like Gav and Dan are going to pick up their electric guitars and start playing in their rock band. In this case though, their instruments are not Rickenbackers but hi-speed cameras.
Awesomely awesome!!!
NOOO YOU CANT SLOW DOWN LIGHT SPEED
that 1.75m footage was taken on my birthday :O
13:10 I didn't realize you were filming soldering in slow motion too
This is Allah's creation So show me what else created Rather, He is one Allah and to Him we will return
Love electric boom from iraq🤗💕
Hmmm, when u guys did that video called “1 MILLION FPS” when u shot eggs, for 100,000 FPS, it is indeed the maximum u can shoot in 1280 x 576 pixels. However, for 200,000 FPS, the resolution was 1280 x 256 but in reality the maximum is 233,300 FPS. For 400,000 FPS,  the resolution was 1280 x 128 but in reality it is 456,500 FPS max. Interesting. For 800,000 FPS in the shooting egg at 1M FPS, the resolution was 1280 x 64. In reality, is it 875,000 FPS like when u recorded Mehdi’s Mark’s generator? Plz let me know!
_✨complicated physics✨_
I think the last spark gap lit up first simply because it was the smallest; it didn't matter so much if it was last. Once it arcs across the shortest gap the whole thing discharges immediately.
Next vid gonna be looking at the speed of light
The speed of electricity is actually just a bit slower than the speed of light
"We captured visual footage of the resonance frequency" sounds like something you'd hear the scientists at black mesa saying.
This is why I like ElectroBoom more than you, he gets to the point, you guys like to beat around the bush.
Omg beautiful shots of electricity; I love this. I'm designing some electric-based themes for some of my products and this really inspires!!))
Mehdi must be in every single video, as he makes it 220 times better
لحظه ای که مهدی را درحال محاسبه نشان میدهد ثابت میکند که او امام زمان است
Wow
I feel like Gav is usually standing there giving a thumbs up like he's showing support, but he's just primed and ready to catch that sweet slo-mo content!👍🎥
Thumbnail lacks a certain +PARRY
1,750,000FPS in a game belike:☠💀☠💀☠💀☠💀☠💀
this is so many fps . the video is littly lagging. Please need better video cam
Capture light at 300000000 fps we will see
“seems like it’s moving at the speed of light almost”
This is the collab i want in my life very marvelous and splendid video
Classic MehdiBOOMs lol!
Move Along nothing to see here
When that guy is present then everything will blast for sure 😂
There's the most good electrical engineer known as Electroboom
i think all yous should do more videos with mehdi,yous all bounce off each other,funny trio and educating and entertaining
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤    slow mo all time
Sooo electricity is faster than light?
Can’t they slow it down even more in post?
These guys should turn the best shots from their videos into 4K wallpapers and sell it. Hella business 😎
1:43 1:56 And now we hear some music 😂
It's so cool that nature provides a relaxing soundtrack every time you slow down.
I love how each layer of slowmo is like going another dream deep in inception ❤
5:35: Mehdi: ARE YA FEELIN IT NOW, MISTER KRABS??
5:24 Dan's face as the voltage goes up is hilarious cause he's just standing there taking it while his face is like "oh my god!!"
I’d like to argue that the reason you see the last arc flash before the rest is because of the speed in which the electricity bounces across those first several electrodes. The visual of the flashes occurred for the first few only after the last node zaps and the current was completed. It was the last to have received the electrical charge on the line therefore it producing the faint charge until it brightens like the rest of them. You gotta think… the other flashes were almost instantly bright, the last one took a second to light up like the rest. The fact that that charge was moving so fast through the first few nodes didn’t show the visual flash until the current was completed on the last lap. Thats (in my unprofessional opinion) a pretty reasonable assumption.
Thanks! That was awesome!
Do YouTube playback speed 0.25x that's wsa amazing 😍
So it seems like electricity rips electrons off of something to open the door to pass electricity?? I'm not super smart but that's what I always seem to get from slomo footage of electricity
You should take this to the camera that can film up to 10 trillion fps...
ElectroBOOM really sparks my entertainment
Wow, a camera that is powered by electricity isnt fast enough to record the speed of electricity. Who'da thunkit.
Mehdi is one of those people, you don't just watch for the entertainment, but you feel you wanna hangout with, have a beer together or something ^ He seems like such a genuine and lovely person
“So, the camera and the testicle aren’t broken.” - Dan
This is simply amazing! What a time to be alive!!!!!!
Tesla coil sounds like the local commuter train accelerating
Wait. They got the guy the internet makes fun of constantly for always electrocuting himself? Lol
Nice chemistry guys. Sorry. Nice sparks 😉
isnt there software to go to the nearest brightest frame ?
These three have such positive energy I want them to be collaborating permanently!! I love all of them knowledges combining! Seeing electroboom collaborate while they do a sharp charge video would be SOOOO fun!
Because of law of attraction thesis possible, they are already connected 🎉
When I first saw the clip I honestly thought that the first one was the only one to actually turned on, and the others shot at the exact same time. Turns out it was moving so dang fast that I missed the shot time when I blinked.
My goodness. Electroboom is a gem.
11:35 thank god the testicle isnt broken
I wonder what would happen if you do this experiment in a vacuum? Because the strikes are being so erratic would they go in straight line in a vaccum.
Fun collab, Mehdi is a cool guy.
Thank you guys. This is science. LOVE IT.
I've always find very odd that the viewing monitor of those cam are so small ! Why not having a normal size display ? When you see the price of those cam it's a bit weird to have such small monitor.
a flash of lightning to feel out the terrain, a moment to calculate the route, a flash to see how far it leads, and so on.
5:11 yeah یکم برو go further 😂😂😂
Damn bro imagine playing Minecraft at 1.7M FPS 😭
I learned so much today! I learned that British people pronounce "tesla coil" as "testicle"
Lengthen your circuit. If you had 100m of wire between each bridge, you'd be guaranteed that they'd fire sequentially. (electricity travels ~100m in copper in 500ns).

Mehdi is one of the best entertainers on this whole website, and that's not mentioning his almost unmatched ability to educate. As for the Slow-Mo Guys, I love that you actually were decently knowledgeable and properly curious on this subject. So many people that do stuff like this just try to inject stupid dumb comedy every 2 seconds which gets really annoying, but is meant to cater to the lowest common denominator. This is a breath of fresh air.
Just listen to 11:36
12:45 should have recorded THAT in slow motion
Gold
This is called "quality as well as valuable content".🫡
Current flows at the drift velocity of the electrons, but the voltage is carried by the electric field in the air surrounding the wires and so it propagates at the speed of light in air.

And the Flash ran from one end of the universe to the other quicker... lol.
What if you daisy chained 4 cameras together, each set to start 437500 frames after the first, would you be able to overlay all those frames to give yourself a video at 7000000 fps?
Hot air dosnt so much rise as much as cold air falls at such a rate it creates some amount of thrust and lift for hot air
Looks very similar to lighting and a Phantom camera.
Just a thought on how you could get more frames per second (yes I realize how insane this suggestion is):  Assuming your camera has some sort of timepulse input, you could theoretically set up two or more cameras to synchronize to that timepulse, and  slightly offset the trigger in such a way that they are capturing “round-robin”.  For example, with two cameras, you offset the timing phase by 90 degrees. So, the second camera would be taking a picture in the middle of the inter-frame gap of the first camera. You would get 1.75M x 2 = 3.5M FPS  With three cameras, offset phase by 60 degrees. 5.25M FPS  Etc…  I’m not an electrical engineer so I can’t design such a mechanism, but I know it’s possible and not terribly expensive. An FPGA tied to an atomic clock reference (which can be had for a few hundred dollars these days) could do that easily.
When Dan looked towards camera, as though he was thinking, 🤔" is my insurance paid up😮😂😂😂
if the electric arc video did not feature ElectroBOOM i would have been so mad
you guys should just put a normal clock with a second hand in the background and always go when a new minute starts, then when you are going trying to find the footage you know about where it's going to be.
I'd like to see a this in a vacuum.
It would be amazing to see this experiment under a vacuum.
🎉they filmed on my bday sweet
How about an open atmospheric N2 Laser to see how it distributes the discharge :)
11:36 "so the camera and the testicle aren't broken"
mehdi is a genius, thanks for this cool video guys.
fake tesla coil, Tesla demonstrated being in an electric field without being shocked thats real tesla coil
Id love to see styropyros 100 car batteries in slow mo like that https://youtu.be/ywaTX-nLm6Y?si=mMNBdF5nSgU1Hfjp
ElectroBOOM is one hell of a sparky.
Thanks for the headphones warning at the start, really appreciate it!
With how high speed that is, Im betting you could see the difference between a light turning on, impacting a wall, and the light coming all the way back  albeit it would still likely have to be a very very far wall, but you could likely catch the frame or 2 between turning it on and it hitting the wall and coming back
Cant you guys just use a program that detects change of color in the frames to find it faster or something?
16:35 only i thought thay were looking at the small camera?😂
That is insane. I'd love to see what you guys would do with the world record slowmo camera, it's like 10 trillion frames per second and can capture the shockwave of the light of a laser pulse hitting water. Played back at 60fps a second at that speed would still take like over 5 millennia, almost 3 Jesus cycles to play back a second. I wouldn't even have the patience to wait for 1.75mil fps like ya'll though, so well done.
I think there is more than meets the eye in this video, even with the 1.7Millions frame per second.
Have multiple phantoms record all at once and stagger their start time between the frame of the phantom before it.  After taking the footage, then each phantom's footage would have to be stitched together, thus filling in the gaps of time that were missed with only one phantom.
I love his videos man, grew up and loved his form of comedy mixed with actual information. I feel like electro boom inspired the one tik tok guy who makes "very human designs."
Top 10 Anime Crossovers
16:30 little rude Dan no?
It’s uncomfortable how the guy keeps begging them to do the highest frame rate not understand that they do things differently with a process
Styropyro chemical fire collar when?
Closed Captions be like "The camera and the testicle arent broken"
so, it takes light 1 ns to travel one foot and 1,750,000 f/s it's way too slow. its the difference between micro and nano second. you'd have to film at 1,000,000,000 f/s to see if there's any difference. but, that's the speed of information. so, for intents and purposes it is instantaneous. i just find it very strange that all of that wiring isn't slowing it down enough to make any difference at all. great video!
That was a very Medhi moment in the intro
#Good
Mehdi is a smart guy. Funny, as well.
10:12
8:10
I wonder if plasma arc lighters look the same as this in slow mo, they light up too fast on 240FPS slow mo, like in one frame nothing and whole cross/X arc in the other frame
I'm curious if its possible to capture it.. My intuition says nothing can be completely simultaneous, but if the speed of electricity is the limiting factor of the Marx generator, the speed limits of light and electricity cannot be bested by a device that relies on both for its functionality.
Title was cut off, I literally never anticipated this happening.
Please collab again! ❤
This is gonna help me greatly in my research! Thank you!
Damn. I thought that test at 1:43 was about to zap to the tune of The Final Countdown by Europe. Opportunity missed.
It's me with a woman.
Should have used a hammer instead of the screw driver so I can call it milnear.😄😎
Man, i love Physics so much 😢❤
ElectroBOOM is a complete maniac and I love it!!😂
Please make slow-mo video on Double Slit Experiment
Does this tesla coil have UL (electromagnetic compatibility certification)? No, maybe that's why it has a destructive influence on the environment?
They would be a gd god
Maybe the Mehdi's power supply burned because it's running on the 110v, and the voltage there is 220v ?
that was  an awesome  collaboration ❤❤❤
When I saw mhedi's video the 1st time I wished the slow mo guys would be involved. Thank yoy guys.
I would love to see the first experiment but with a fan under the arc, that can blow cold or hot air, would anything change?
Best collab I've ever seen in my life on you tube. Thanks for guys👏👏👏👏
Wow! Praise be to the Creator.
Watching this, it just blows my mind to think about the camera with 70 TRILLION frames per second.
I would think it's moving at the speed of light
Do it in a vacuum
What if it just travels exponentially faster as it goes backwards on the 2nd machine. Since we can see the last one start the reaction and then everything after gets exponentially faster.
Great vid!! Got some dragonball Z powering up vibes from the electricity shots!
Theres only one thing  etter on you tube than Slow Mo Guys...watching Slo Mo Guys at x0.25 speed😂
This is the collab i have been waiting for
How have I not seen this video yet this guy is a ledgend 😂😂
Just awesome!
Well, watching my hives and inflammation dissolve every day until it all disappeared was definitely appeasing, I went with what I mentioned and after 20 days my urticaria/angioedema disappeared. I just go'ogled the latest by Shane Zormander and now my skin is as smooth and healthy as it has ever been!
I LOVE THIS GUY
4:25 Whoa Black Betty, bam-ba-lam!
This is a very shocking video 😂
1:43 What a beautiful melody
bottom line the speed of 'electricity' in metal and in air are completely different....
18:15
This was interesting
Slow mo is like another dimension
wait is Gav part of the LGBTQIA+ ? If so all SUPPORT! If no also all SUPPORT! lol.
If you count each frame as a photo, these are probably the most photo'd humans of all time.
The ethereal music you play on slowed footage is from a meditation and sleep aid channel that I listened to in a long loop for 6hours uninterrupted so when I watch your videos I get put into an immediate state of zen and want to sleep - thus your channel is calming
Could someone explain how an arc is occured?
I love electroboom, but if we're talking electricity, you have to do a collab with styropyro
I was in middle school and they brought in some kind of machine that produced static electricity. Ya stood up on it and it would make all the hair on your body to stand up. They told us not to step off it until it quit making noise. Me being a troublemaker I didn't listen and had step off it. It felt like it blew the bottom off my shoe. I should have listened for one in my life. Lol
If you trust Mehdi and survive, you are indeed fortunate.  I wouldn't touch him; he probably carries voltage.
well, if they ever make a 50m fps camera, i know what yall will do first XD
*sees ElectroBOOM*  Me: this is gonna be good
I had an epiphany. Maybe the reason it's so difficult to see the electron transferring at that speed, is because the electrons of the camera can't go any faster either
Electroboom is one of those guys who's going to just stop posting one day and you'll find out years later it's because they died doing some stupid stunt.
150K Camera btw guys.
17:32 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...dad joke
I always watched electric boom hurt complimations
you can do this with your arms under a furry blanket......cover yourself with a furry blanket in the dark and rub your arm back n forth with your other hand following it and you will get static electricity flowing through your hand like a Tesla coil.
Three very unique senses of humor. It works.
8:38 me on a first date
this will probably have a big scientific impact as well. great job everyone
bro sounds like dragon ball z ki gathering
Time moves differently in here. Gwahaha.
The ways different forms of energy move is so fascinating.
whoa, so the arc actually extends and branches off in multiple directions, until one arc hits a conductive object, then all the other branches converge into the one that made contact.
11:13 As an electrical engineering student, he originally said the peak voltage, Vp, but we generally go off of Vrms, which is a way of measuring AC, it's Root Mean Squared, which is Vp divided by root 2. Just a little insight on what he was talking about and how he messed up the number originally
I know it is a little abstract, but I wonder if ants don't follow the same type of paths that electricity does.
The circuit has to charge all the way to the end capacitor and then start to discharge at the end and go back to the beginning to start the charge all over again.
It kind of makes sense that the last one would go first, the arcs to the screwdriver also started at both sides and met between the tesla coil and the screwdriver.
I wasn't expecting a collab between you guys, but I will take it all day!
15:40 is there a rolling shutter effect at all?
"where 1 second is about 20 hours" when we reach the point that a second lasts a whole day, could we get a 3rd video for the "every second lasts and hour" but instead its if every second lasted an entire day
Considering electro BOOM hasn’t killed himself yet proves just how brilliant he really is
Love all the way from Garden Reach Kolkata West Bengal India 🇮🇳 Sahil 😊
the smallest gap will always fire first.  or the one given some type of ionisation promoter... like a point. ideally they all charge to the same potential. the single gap breaks down, you can see its the smallest, some are nearly twice as large...  but the instant it does break, the potential across the other gaps instantly exceeds their breakdown threshold, and it all goes. it _should_ be a cascade out from the initial arc..  at close to the speed of light. whats the propagation rate along this form of "transmission line"?   shame it wasnt set up with the smallest gap in the center... yet it would still need a higher frame rate...  were talking... gulp... picoseconds... three orders of magnitude again, at least...  begs the question... how on earth do you measure a femto second?

I don't think Dan's nervousness was faked.
And now consider that the electromagnet field only travels at ~1% of the speed of light within copper compared to in a vacuum.
I love lightning so this is now my favorite slo mo video
Ha ha ha har 😂
The thing that triggers me is that the resistors on the Marx Generator are not all the same direction. It doesn't affect functionality, it just bothers me xD
@ElectroBOOM, master of the magic smoke.
Mehdi sounds so nervous.
the camera should have a option to skip to the brightest frames
why do woman live longer than men men:
Is that the linus shocking guy!?
⚠️ 😳 ( 🥽 )
How do these guys have more subs than Colin Furze?????
This guy is awesome two channels collaborating that are awesome
YES I WAS HOPING FOR THIS
Wait.... is Mehdi persian??❤👏👏👏
Close your eyes and listen to this: 4:28
i captured slow motion video with a slow-motion camera, there is no use of it but i was excited capturing it.😁 nice video 😄
4:00 It looks like it leaves a tiny burnt spot where it arcs to his hand

Lololol The tesla coil straight up could take your phone out of your pocket, pull up msgs and steal your girl in no time. WIth the way it was messing with that monitor
I asked my dad, once a licensed electrician and small electronics technician, and he said, "Yeah. Electricity basically moves at the speed of light."
To be more precise it's igniting the oxygen in the air which is why it follows a particular path and then changes its path when that oxygen is used up.
Interesting how electricity arcs look like plant roots, or veins, or nerves, or lightning
The lowest voltage one goes first because all the rest of them were waiting for it to charge high enough to jump the gap and complete the circuit.
I think that mext time. image can process by cpu to find the different image then we can find the point of chging
Pure gold :)
What about many mirrors system and laser. To see how light speed works
hi
I L💖VE your two channels! To compare "slowmoguys" to "electroBOOM" is like compare a mosquito to an eagle! (🦟🦅) However i like your channels both. A big HUG from Italy💚🤍💖
Is it just me or did electroboom seem bored. Like he didn't wanna be there.
hot air does not rise, cooling air is expanding, Anyone can compress some air and observe the heat produced & will still blindly argue about HOT AIR Balloons!!
It should be very interesting with subzero ambient temperatures.?
Thanks guys for giving me hope that people exist that love science instead of nonsense.
No wonder south africa is struggling with electricity, because its too fast for them😂😂
Is that how a pulse generator works?
So would the last connection in the circuit start to lights because the capacitors will all have to be charged to “complete the circuit “ before they Trigger ? Very cool as always  👍
Thank you..  for clearing up my mind
Elon & Tesla will never have my respect until there’s a Tesla with a functioning Tesla Coil in the trunk that reacts to the throttle.
8:23 Isn't it an electrodynamic oscillation going on there?
You just need a slow mo camera filming the other slow mo camera to get 3.5 mil frames per second hahahaha. (Sarcasm)
OK time for a faster camera! lol
That Tesla Coil gave him a dap. 😂
Doesn't a spark travel at the speed of light ?
It’s truly amazing how popular that guys has gotten. First time I ever saw one of his videos ages ago, I legitimately thought he did whatever he did it on accident. Either way always enjoy watching his stuff.
I’m glad Dan said 4-5 inches is a long length
Mehdi the type of dude if you were to ask him "Is this safe" He'd start laughing
So does lightning strike the same place multiple times? I’m really curious. Knowing the slow motion and it flashes. Mother Nature is so unique.
I bet Gav smells in 4d
прохождение лазера навстречу камеры наверно можно снять с такой камерой в пыльной среде
Watching this video on .25 speed is so hilarious 🤣🤣
Very interesting
Fantastic Collaboration with three Awesome Dudes !
Woo they achieved so much
Gargamel traded magic for science
I wonder if you'd capture the arc better if it were in a vacuum
The lightning is just amazing
“One tesla tesla coil” A buck and a tesla tesla coil
Well scientifically camera is capturing  light. And electricity is invisible until it developed the spark. Well maybe you have to go beyond a speed of light to capture electricity sparks in slow mo right ?
Innocent question:  If the path through the air becomes ionized, paving the way for the next spark to follow the same path, what happens if you move the air appreciably, as with a high flow fan?  Will the arc follows a fresh path each time?  Would the ionized air molecules have been shuttled far enough away?
woaaa amazing ❤❤
What electro boom said towards the end about how the current moves at the speed of light actually isn’t far off. Electricity in a copper wire will travel pretty close to the speed of light. If a beam of light in a vacuum can travel around the entire planet in less than a 5th of a second, reduce that distance to the length of that device, less then a foot and you pretty much have close to instantaneous travel
Really? I mean - on 1.750.000 FPS we can see two frames what's going on... I mean, we can see nothing, in first frame is nothing and second one everything going up. 🤷‍♂️😅
video starts with Mehdi shorting something, cool.
That guy is really smart
bro forgot what they were looking at 17:33
the one at the end went first because the beads were slightly closer to eachother than the rest.
even in the first 12 seconds that he made a cap go boom i still believe him it was a accident even tho it not
Loved this video ! Just 3 nerds nerding out, fantastic collab, super interesting !
I wonder if the last circuit firing first was actually a streamer... or maybe spooky action at a distance even.... interesting for sure no matter what. No matter what! Bahahaha
19:00 skip all the random science talk and everything and get straight to it
These arks could be used to tell what's going on at the center of the Earth
The charge builds up more in the first ones before the flow reaches the final one that completes the circuit. I doubt they react simultaneously, probably at the speed of light. But it explains why the ones at the front are brighter
I was loading a howitzer onto a train car in germany with other soldiers. The rail company hadn't shut down the power of the railroad. It had 66000 volts going through overhead wires. One of the men on the next train car tripped on the top of his howitzer and swung his arm up to catch his balance. I heard the crack of lightening, saw the flash, and smelled over cooked meat. The soldier was on the ground competely burned and smoking. A really horrible scene, that I'll never forget.
Air can blink at any know frequency 😮
i was afraid we weren't going to have classic electroBOOM. himself getting shocked, blowing power supplies, random thing completely fails, the usual.

The two greatest channels
amazing
That's stupid cool!  I wonder what an arc in a vacuum looks like at 1.75M...
It would be interesting to see you try imaging the "double-slit" experiment trying to document some aspect of light's wave/particle duality.
I swear these guys are carrying out primary research into electricity.  Like back when science was driven by curiosity.
I don't understand how that Phantom computer is writing 41 million pixel buffers in real time.
🔥👊🔥
500 nanoseconds, translates to 500 meters of distance, traveled by a beam of light, or a wave of gravity, or the funneling of an electron along a wire. That's not much wiggle room. I bet a collection of "straw" electrons flow forward at the speed of light from the beginning of the circuit, and trip each "camel back" capacitor to arc all in sequence. Once a few electrons bridge the gap for the first capacitor, a huge flood of electrons flow all the way through the circuit, filling and then emptying each capacitor at the speed of the flow, the speed of light. If you were watching the light that was shooting forward from the circuit, it'd appear perfectly simultaneous.  I think. There isn't much wiggle room, but there's still the room for a bit of delay between each arc aside from speed-of-light lag.  500 meters!
The electro boom guys Mark's generator looks like the flash happens all across all of it at the exact same time even at 1 million 750,000 frames per second. That underlines the idea that electricity doesn't really travel through wires. What travels through the wires is an electrical CHARGE, not the actual electricity. One atom charges the next and the entire chain becomes charged. Only then does the electricity make its appearance as a flash or whatever.
How about 15 hz?
12:45 🤣🤣
4:25 definitely sounds inappropriate without picture lmao
Different levels of learning: "I learned that warm air rises!" :D
+++Because electricity moves slower 'about' a conductor [not 'IN' a conductor. See So You Think You Know Physics. The Big Misconception About Electricity [Veritasium] - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHIhgxav9LY ] than through the air [near vacuum relative solid matter. Tthink density-resistance/impedance],  the reason the first gap was active before the last/others is because it is closest to the initiating power source. Get an even longer ladder and faster camera and you'll visually/experimentally prove that electric power travels through air to some heretofore unknown degree.   UFO power supply???
Thank god Nikola invented the Tesla coil. Now we have some cool glass orbs 🤩
The truly shocking and amazing thing about this vid is this: the only person in the room without a beard is an Iranian.  This subverts the very laws of nature!
So much brain power in one video! And still trying to touch electricity 😂
That happens so insanely fast. i already can't comprehend the speed at which these 1mil fps's take place, but then that goes even faster.
The most ambitious crossover huh?
7:21
NEXT VIDEO - Bullet shot right above Tesla coil will the current make contact with bullet, if it does will this change bullet trajactory?
1:42 bro did the blue lobster thing
Dan is such a good lab rat!
The irony of watching a 20 minute long video about slow motion at double speed.
Does this imply that (ironically) once air has ionised, lightening always strikes at least twice ?
1:43 The best song ever.
gentlemen, decide between spark going DIRECTLY at the target ( energy source ~~~~~~~ target) verse (energy source ^/\/\/\/~~/\~\/~~\/\/)   seems there is a wave/power source/amplitude perspective that requires some eyes / perspective and thought. rock on gents.
I want to see a 22 bullet firing out of barrel
Awesome bro
4:43 "lets see how that feels " - ELECTRO BOOM
Remember the something-billion (or trillion, i forgot) fps thing that could record light? Yeah you probably need that
Awesome content, very cool and educational,  Thanks 🤟🏾
"Do you not trust this face?"  *voldemort grin*
Watching this video 3 months after it's debut. So much happened in this video, it may not have been to your expectation. Many hours were put in for my 20 minute consumption. "The last one went first" is my big take away from this video.   I hope you you guys colab, coabb, co-abs... together again. To possibly answer a mystery.   Does the Earth reach up to grab lighting?  Testing must continue.  I do hope the Slow Mo Guys see this comment. Unless it is just a stupid shower thought. In that case, comments, you know the drill by now.
When i saw this collab I wasn’t even surprised I was just happy hahaha

Mr Electric Bean!
"i was shocked literally" LOLOLLLOOLLOOLOL
10:40 who watched this video with 7 million fps like me??
Obviously the people involved here are technically knowledgeable, doing  a science experiment and not knowing what to expect.
1.75 million frames per second allows us to see a little more what's going on with an electrical arc, but it isn't quite fast enough. Light travels at 186,000 miles per second.
Great demonstration, making science fun!
5:30 tornado siren?
my computer can get to 1,750,001 FPS
Looks like 1.75Mfps isn't enough to resolve the difference between the sparks.  Try using the trillions of fpm technique in your other video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ys_yKGNFRQ
15:32  the camera captures picture/video line by line may be that's the reason you are seeing the last one is only ON.   Like the camera have captured most of the pixel but when it reaches to the last one at the same time the circuit turn on and the camera ends up only  capturing the last one light.  It's camera shutter effect which can be also seen when you take picture of a fast moving fan
Hi! Sound guy here! The arcs following the same pattern in the air due to the heating of the particles within the trail also explains the tonal nature of the tesla coils noise that it makes when discharging. You could hook up a MIDI clock output to the frequency regulation, effectively letting you play MIDI music through the tesla coil!  I do hope that little idea turns into a video for you guys! Leave an upvote if you've read this and you'd like to get the idea to Gavin, Dan and ElectroBOOM!Loving this video a lot and I'm only at 2:51  Hope you guys are doing well! Been a massive long time fan for years.
Brings out the schoolkid in you!
Yooo that scientist is from the inspirational Heated Seat video!
Mr Slomo, do you have a way to observe how the neuron in our brain fires electrical signals ?
Lightning/Electricity was always my favorite physical phenomenon. In any RPG games I'll make a lightning wielder. The idea of the speed and sheer power involved in it is mindblowing.
I wonder how is he still alive?
11:36 testecle?

You look like Jake Gyllenhaal😂
love this
I've always wondered why, with the equipment on hand, you seem apprehensive to use your highest fps cameras?
You know how Katie Bouman caught the picture of a black hole did so using AI to identify candidate pictures out of millions? Really should look into something like that for those 1.75Mfps videos.
10:35 - 10:48 someone needs to put these sounds in video games
Жестко 🤘
The Guinea Pig or Sucker in this video clip DOESN"T Have a Pacemaker or a Defibrillator! NONE of these fools have those Devices implanted. I promise.
10:32 what was that bee sound
When ElectroBoom is giving you a sneaky smile, BRACE for an explosion, or pain!
That guy is a dangerous dumb dumb.
Most advances in science were made with the help of hapless fools who held onto something while others watched...:P   Dan deserves a medal.
Finally are three youtubers here...
Millions of dollars of equipment and still hard to slow down Electricity . Wow.
There should be an Ai , that can soft through the information so you don't have to soft through all the footage
مهدی صادقدار 😂
Nikola Tesla would be so happy to see this
When the slomoguys are old i want to see a time-lapse video of how they aged.
Interesting how the Tesla-coil messed around with the capacitive screen of the recorder.
Surprisingly, the slime mold behaves just like that, but instead of metal, it's attracted to a food source.
rubber gloves?
ok these guys need to do a colab every month or so. they're hilarious together 😂🤣👍
I love that you found someone just as excited to hurt Dan as Gavin is.
it hit you right on the ringfinger ar 00:04:02
I feel like I'm watching a filler episode of doctor who ok the flash
By the way, HEAT DOES NOT “rise”, it ONLY RADIATES ! THATS A FACT. 2:38
To measure light, wouldn’t you need a camera that captures frames at (or faster) the speed of light? I would also propose using detectors placed at least at two various points, then measuring the energy differential between the two points after the initial release of energy to determine the flow of the electricity. Has something like this already been invented? I would love to know so I can conduct further research myself.
This new guy is pretty funny
They should make content together more often :)
I've always gotten the impression that gav is annoyed by dan being so dumb all the time, and it's caused a strife in their relationship.

I’m going to be stealing that FPS
In a way it kind of makes sense that the end would be the first place to initiate the sequence because it’s the most important part of the process if the electricity has nowhere to go It can’t leave.
This Time medhi brown his real devices
No ya velio😢
i thought this was 1750000 volts not fps. i forgot this was the slowmo guys not the tesla coil guys.
isin't this video kind of proving E=MC2?
11:03 432 hz? What are the chances of that!
Always remember to divide by 2
19:56
im gonna go try this
best crossover since endgame
You guys should do this again but with the arc inside a magnetic field. That's would be very interesting.
İTS ELECTROBOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
the reason it happens at the same time is because electricity travels at the speed of light
try the same filming a Tesla coil in a completely dust free high vacuum environment PLEASE. I wonder if there will be any difference on the path of the arc
Should do a bit on someone playing a pc game at 60fps/100fps/120fps/144fps and record the screen at 500-1mill frames to show the differences
I want you guys to do for light 😉
Coil itself works as magnet when current flow in it ...
If current flow end attached with magnet...then the Current free electrons  flow between magnetic attraction field ....
18:15 are you okay Mehdi?
Mehdi !!!!! hurrrrrayyyy!!!
This is my favorite thing about YouTube. When YouTubers get together and create hybrid content.
At 1.75 million frames per second, light travels 171.3 metres between frames. That’s a downright normal distance. It makes me curious if there’s a way to measure time dilation with a camera like that.
Just love how it's a bunch of dudes having fun staring at electricity move very slowly 😂♥️. Love you guys!
Love the giggle
silly question, but could you take 2 or 3 of those phantom cameras side by side. program them to take a frame while its neighbor's shutter is closed and then stitch the two videos together for double the frames?
Maybe it break time and rips through space and lights the last one first in a reverse time loop that we can only witness w the magic camera
13:27 Mehdi seems to genuinely fear for his life.
11:36 did i hear that right...
nice vid btw rip marx generator
the colab we didnt know we need
Fun Fact about Electrical Arcs:  Electrical arcs produce some of the highest temperatures known to occur on earth. Up to 35,000 degrees Farenheight, which is 4X the temperature of the surface of the sun! All known materials are vaporized at this temperature, which causes a sudden expansion of air. Blast pressure waves have thrown workers across rooms... What sustains an arc? An electric arc is a discharge of electric current across a gap in a circuit. It is sustained by the presence of a thermally ionized column of gas (called a plasma) through which current flows.
Harry Potter lol X'D 9:48
Can he be burned while riding a motorbike like the Ghost Rider? 😂
doesnt electricity travel between 70 / 80% of the speed of light. I think even in 10 years this will be a difficult shot to pull off
I was going to ask why there wasn't activity in the last gap first in the 1.7 mil. But then you did see it.  Because that would have weird to see that in the slower speed than faster surely?
5:26
This is the colab we have all been needing
Hello, The Slow Mo Guys! I will tell you about a microphone... the "Sanken CUX 100k" This microphone is able to capture sounds from 20 Hz to a 100 kHz! you will be able to shift frequencies down and still get a natural sounding slow-motion sound!
5:25 sounds like the computer getting mad in Don't Hug Me I'm Scared lol.
time to get the budget for a faster camera?
That  screwdriver part was quite dangerous, imagine if his arm spasmed and he smashed it in his eye or something.
It isn't really surprising because electricity is moving at speed of light, so capturing it on video even at 1.75M frames is too slow.
💕💕💕💕👍👍👍🇬🇧🇺🇸
The speed of those arcs in the marx generator was insane
Amazing
Mehdi has zero interest in foreplay.
Well see ya guys in 10 years trying this again
16:37 Masterfully done Mehdi.
Really liked this one, one of the few things I truly get nerdy about is fractal structures and electrical arcs like this one are an amazing example of natural fractals and it sorta follows chaos theory because of that
5:25 if you slow down the video , you can see a spark in his mouth.
This would be interesting to see in slow-mo: https://youtube.com/shorts/-JwVQG5uEjM?feature=share
Mehdi is excellent, he's so funny.
the light speed is too fast that even the craziest camera that can go 1,750,000 fps cannot beat light speed
8:09
17:08 Gav, let's not forget that electricity travels at 670,616,629 miles per hour :)
pretty sure the last one lights up first because the two beads are the closest together of them all.
clickbait thumbnail 👎
Aww! I like how you can tell the guest gets excited it the middle when he can actually see the AC frequency because he starts rocking back and forth ❤️
Magic
Hey guys, I have a suggestion that I think would be very interesting...  I'd like to see you do some slow-Mo camera footage with electric arcs in a magnetic field.  Have you seen some of the experiments they've done with it? I think it would look awesome! maybe even playing with oscilations or frequencies of the arc. If you guys think this would be interesting as I do and you decide to go ahead with it, please email me and let me know. Maybe we can brainstorm on it and think of other ways we can manipulate the electricity for the experiment.  Thank you. You guys rock!
I slowed the 1.75 Mfps to 0.25 of its speed...Youtube, you beauty !
Going to school for engineering atm, this actually helped me make sense of some stuff I have been having trouble visualizing!
No mention of the several times there was an arc from the screwdriver that reached out and connected with the Tesla arc.
Thunderf00t sent me here with his brill follow-up :) Ace video.
Ini nih rajanya kesetrum 🗿
conventional current assumes a direction from high voltage to low voltage, but really electrons are flowing from the low voltage terminal to the high voltage terminal, because electrons carry a negative charge. this could be why the last arc lights first
It sounds like a wild magnezone appeared
can't you rewind from the end?
Electrical engineer here; My guess on why the marx generator lights up all at once would be that Mehdi IS technically correct, they are filling up from left to right. However, once the first stage is fully charged, my guess is that the impedance between the two discharge nodes is effectively infinite (acting as a perfect open), because there is another path of least resistance within the circuit, going to the next stage capacitor. Once that next stage capacitor fills up, rinse repeat down the line until you finally fill up the very end one. When that one fills to its max capacitance, there is nowhere left for the current to 'freely' move, so everything 'overflows' all at once.
2:58  Electroboom's choice of pants combined with the lighting makes this a rather unfortunate screenshot!  LMFAO!!!  🤣👌
Mehdi: "And now.... take the screwdriver and push it directly into the plug socket and see how it feels" 😂
i don't know how but many uploads are over 12h, from the date of the time limit.
that is crazy. electricity is SO fast that even 1.75 million frames per second can't make it look slow. incredibly humbling if anything, who knows if we'll ever be able to perceive the true magnificence of it
Electroboom with the Slow Mo Guys, I had no idea I needed this in my life!
Seeing that in slow-mo. Glad I caught this video!
@theslowmoguys Do another video on this: https://youtube.com/shorts/-JwVQG5uEjM?feature=share
Great to see my PC burning can't even extinguish my PC     Only in Ohio
y'all should have caught the saudering in slow mo
I believe the last gap fired first only because the last gap was my new the smaller
@5:54   is essentially how the lightning stepped leader coming from the cloud meets an upward streamer coming from grounded objects.  It also demosntrates how the ionized channels first propagate in the air by following corona discharges and when the circuit completes, the unconnected branches discharge.  Nice job.
ElectroBOOM, such an awesome and humble guy.. great collab! 😁
These are true men right here.
I wonder if it is possible to use several asynchronously shooting cameras?
it speaks volumes to what you guys are doing, the fact that that obviously brilliant electrical expert is still able to learn things about his own profession by seeing the footage you come up with. great video
Watching 1,750,000 fps in 30 fps
“It’s quite a big difference as well 4 or 5 inches” hahahahaha
I'm surprised you didn't isolate the last arc so the light it gave off wouldn't blow out the video on the rest of the device.
australians and persians in the same video. crikey.
basically just caught the speed of light on camera. nice job
One of the best videos ever. You guys captured electricity in slow motion and never before seen footage
Awesome video! Great to see you guys collaborate 😃😃
wish i could get 1.7m fps on csgo
When LEGENDS come together, we get an Arc lightning.. love both of your videos.
Pov me chillin at 60 fps
Slomo schlieren:ing these experiments would be so much more epic! With the additional information that the air pressure differences caused by the arcs I think one would get way cooler pics
Yeah. I love ElectoBOOM videos! Next time, try one trillion frame camera that can freeze photon actions.
I need Derek from Veritasium to make a video with his feedback on this.
LOVE YALL!
There is a direct correlation between what you guys are doing and space travel.
Anytime I take a coat off and feel the static, I grab scissors or a fork and touch the fridge or sink or door with it so it chocks the metal item and not me.
The 250 kHz figure is interesting.  Lightning also contains a lot of radio frequency components, which is why it generates lighting crashes on LW, MW, and low HF radios.
https://youtu.be/MzIGnOWBU9c  ♠️
wow
https://youtu.be/AnBtHiT1ajk
lightning discharge of high voltage passes through conducting substances- the energy shreds the electrons in the substance it contacts, so the ghostly afterimage is actually luminated ionized gas molecules, in this case air
It's weird to see electro boom out of character
I live electrl boom and his fails lol
Sometime I wish my phone was that fast :/
11:35 I thought I heard something else for a minute lol
Me at 0.25x
*you’re a wizard Hary*
5:21 *attempt to killing some one
“I Don’t think you can upload a video that is longer than twelve hours.” *Datto uploading his 24 hour world’s first race of Last Wish*
4:00 the power of Thor.
Maybe don't hold the screwdriver by the metal if you don't want to get shocked...
It looks like he's using a raspberry pi as a controller (e.g. 4:26). That's great!
The looks on Dan's face as he is told what he is to do all say the same thing: I got a bad feeling about this.
This taught me that lightning does in fact strike the same place twice, because it prefers to follow the path of the first strike lol
7:42 that face from electroboom:)))))))
best Combo EVER!!! slow mo guys and ElectroBOOM <3 please moreeeee
impossible to watch these videos ... it's just some clown's blabberfest .. bla bla yap yap yap ... NOBODY CARES! everyone is here to see the slow-mo footage ... you make yourselves sound so important, when you're NOTHING! I had this idea way before you clowns, I just wasn't lucky enough to have enough money to buy the equipment to make slow-mo videos.  it sickens me how all you do is YAP and BLA ... you should rename yourselves to "yap and bla show"
women life freedom
How much memory does that camera have on board?
Never knew he will be here
Mehdi is so used to it, he doesn't even flinch when a capacitor explodes next to his face 😂
1 foot per nano-second.  They need a faster camera! lol
This camera is dead slow compared to the task. If you measure breakdown times with an oscilloscope, you will see times around 20 ... 40 ns, and such a marx will erect in <100 ns. So you can't see details with one picture in every 600 ns.
The path of least resistance: cognizant physiological habituation: pathways in space: atmospheric environmental variances: the path of least resistance...🤔
electroboom eh? that guy swears alot
5:25 sounds like game over music or something. Especially with Dan's grunt
because the physical direction is always from minus to plus.
Сколько fps надо, что бы увидеть как через щель пролетает фотон?
Dude looks like a super villain who’s really nice at the same time
because electricity travels negative to positive
Thanks Tesla
Crazy idea, never gonna interesting: slow mo cameras in slow mo.
Mehdi is the god of electricity. He is incredible funny and a genius.
I like Mehdi's personality.
This place looks like a horror game 💀
14:20 Couldn't it be leftover plasma residue? Congratulations for the video, they are very educational.
It looks like Google maps calculating an itinerary
Please! I'd like some explanation of the physics of what's happening - amazing tho it is to watch, what am I looking at, sparks apart?
“It’s just pure, unedited reality” Gav
Well even tho u got a camera that shows 70,000 times slower. From there, ur still 9580 times slower with that camera to measure light. But I’m still mf waiting for that.
1750000 frames per second? is this made with the new graphic card of nvidia 4090 Ti RTX  ?
"Electricity HURTS!" - Luke Skywalker
May god help you guys. Be safe
There's a video that's like 12days long.
You should get a really powerful microscope and film things in ultra slow motion!
Do you know how fast it actually travelled? Did you discharge the capacitors after each attempt? Just curious if they held a charge after the arc. It was cool to see the mass of the electrical charge separate the air then the air giving the telltale "thunder" sound.
We eagerly wait this much awaited Collaboration
LOL, playing with electricity with a guy that apparently does not have a single clue on what he is doing is the best idea in the world.... :-]
Welding arc next?
I made a really powerful Jacob's Ladder using a MOT and a capacitor. My phone had a high speed option, just *NOTHING* compared to this camera.. Going to make a Tesla coil to generate enough power to light a fluorescent several feet away while I hold the bull in my hands. I've done it on a small skill, but I think I'm going to bring it up quite a bit.
That intro to electro boom 😂😂
Not high enough FPS.
So what happened at 16:00. Why does the light started from the end, any answer ?
Why does the spark start at the other end?? Silly humans. Electricity acts no different than Pneumatic or Hydraulic. Imagine the oval ends as nozzles. Your vessel has to first fill completely and pressurize. The pressure and back-flow starts at the farthest point.
8:05 Shannon & Weaver moment.
I swear on the first 100000fps test I thought it was playing the blue lobster song for a second
That stuff at 3:00 is probably less about the ionized channel created by the previous arc and more about electricity always taking the path of least resistance.  So that path is displayed by the very first arc, and it doesn't change much in the millionth of a second or whatever between arcs, so the next arc takes almost the same exact path.  I thought the little baby arcs coming off the antenna as the charge moved down were pretty cool though.  THAT is likely due to the ionization of the air around the antenna as the charge travels along it, but the antenna is still the dominating path of least resistance.
I love to think that electricity is a visualization of our branching realities. It’s just an imagination, but it is an interesting thing to think about.
Wouldn't they need a frame rate faster than the speed of light to capture the progression?
"You won't feel it :)" Dan: oh ok
Try in Mhz or Ghz frequency.
The last one in the chain would have the highest combined voltage right? that means the energy gets there before the arc is formed or visible if that makes any sense hmm strange
Mehdi: Show me the slow mo Dan & Gav: 100k fps Mehdi: I mean the actual slow mo Dan & Gav: 500k fps Mehdi: was I not clear? Dan & Gav: 1m fps Mehdi: I am gonna ask you one last time Dan & Gav: 1.75m fps Mehdi: PERFECTION
the same path flashes 2-3 times it’s crazy to see it in the exact same jagged path traced back. just like lightning
Now I go solder
4:18 haha the smile that can induce internal panic hahaha
My first thoughts were "They made a video with the guy who burns and shocks himself regularly?"  He makes great points refuting other videos (sometimes) but SO OFTEN something goes wrong.
This is the best video you've ever made in my opinion! I love it.
It will be going at lightspeed as it is electromagnetic ... you'll need a bigger boat!
4:29 reminds me of me with my partner at a sleepover
Mehdi is literally like Tony Stark when he was in the Cave
that actually looks like a wave function collapse on the screwdriver one. its like a cloud of possibilities that collapses into a single line
6:01 Looks like Loki breaking the Multiverse
what about direct current?
1:58 sounds like an 80's video game boss battle intro.
Electricity do infact move at ALMOST the speed of light. We commonly say its at the speed of light because its so close to the actual light speed
I thought we were going to see the lightning travelling in slow motion just like a bullet. But there is no different to seeing it without the slowmo
The webbing off bolt looks like a magnetic field from the gap.
Make the spacing even using a caliper. May need to check x y and z direction in spacing
The spacing is causing the last one to fire first. Based on lvl of electrical intensity
i honestly want to know the storage it would take
This was an awesome collaboration please do again!
I think ElectroBoom was an executioner in a past life. He enjoyed giving pain a bit too much...
a lot of brains behind making this video. expertise crossing paths. really cool.
Sad to see this video perform so badly compared to the newest one
Is there any chance we could get the original recordings? 🙂 Thanks!
Hey Medhi!! 😁👍🤩🥳 Perfect guest.. Specially for electric arcs 💪😙
I don't understand, I'm a subscriber for years but I never see SloMoGuys videos when they come on YouTube. Typically I see them few weeks after. But I'm a huge fan of their videos, watching multiple time each one... In any case, thank you for sharing this very good job with us. 👍👍👍
You'd think the camera software would have the ability to skip to the next frame with more than a certain percentage difference? Would save a lot of time looking at hundreds of thousands of frames of nothing!
It's pretty cool, I watched all of the videos from you 3 that day. I am surprised you guys don't have a big screen TV to watch the footage. Does the camera not have HDMI :D And what's the maximum speed you can playback?
I love how Mehdi quotes the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem as if it's some sort of folk saying 😂
I have that same carpet in my basement! I did the whole floor in that design.
OUTSTANDING VIDEO  (thank you for posting it)
4:54 'im in danger'
been asking for this. Finally!!! 😍
17:34 The spark is going pretty fast. Say the generator is 0.4 meters long and it all lights up within 1/1,750,000 of a second. Then the speed is at least 0.4m/(1/1,750,000 s)= 0.4*1,750,000 m/s= 700,000 m/s That's about .23% of the speed of light, but that is only the calculation based on the frame rate of the camera. With a 750 million fps camera you could measure the speed of the sparks up to the speed of light.
Confirmed: Electricity is not fast enough to film electricity
I like these videos. well, now you can all understand. how inside of your body works uninterruptedly .but still you can't imagine the creator of all existence. the creator of You
wow.. 😎😎😎😎 slomoguys with my teacher mehdi sadaghdar 😎😎😎😎,  both are my favorite channels 😎😎😎😎💪💪👍💪👍,.. this is the best collaboration ever  😎😎😎😎
1 million fps is so slow compared to the speed of light. at 1 million fps light travels 1 thousand feet between each single frame.
I guess the double slit experiment in slow motion isn't anything good, otherwise they would have made a video about it ages ago.
When I first started watching this channel. You had a good 300 to 500 FPS. Seeing these numbers go into the millions just makes me wonder how much memory you were using
So cool!  There a vid of one trillion frames per second.  You can see the light travel through a bottle and "echo" around inside. Here's the Ted Talk link. https://youtu.be/Y_9vd4HWlVA
gotta admit. kinda geek paradise here. also.. FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER 4 LYFE.
Poor Dan is always the Guinea pig 🤣🤣🤣💜💜💜💜💜💜
Oh, how I want to participate in your experiments! :) You are awesome, guys! Thank you for your wonderful videos!
He is professional of electricity
9:41 The best moment. You should have recorded Dan's reaction to being shocked in slowmo
When he says am gonna increase the powe look at dans face
loveee both
Been watching you all for years now. As an aircraft Avionics Tech I would love to see the physical damage that occure to components on circuit boards with static discharge. On a extremely close up scale.
mehdi is the fun quirky uncle of youtube. always has something to teach you under all those jokes
How about HID bulbs in Slo Mo.
Nice !
I need more of this collab
could you film how a fuse or rather circuit breaker works in an emergency? - like hair dryer to a bath...
you guys should do a video on air bag deployments
Faster!
All of that speed is turtle slow compared to the vastness of the Universe. In fact, turtle slow as a description is being extremely generous.  We will NEVER explore this Universe Star Trek or Star Wars style. It just is not going to happen.  As an aside, please stop allowing Hollywood movies to direct your ideas on what is possible.
16:05 lighting reaches out too, which would make it "the last" one in that case. So something is happening before something is visibly happening. The excitement of particles, likely. Kinda like... a domino where the state of every domino piece (before starting to move) first needs to be "flipped" to "falling mode". Essentially, this video and experiment is trying to breach what we perceive as reality.
In a "Jacobs Ladder" the lightning starts low and then climbs higher and higher as the heated air rises!
That was really ballsy of you guys to run the coil before camera like that. Like there's an existing chance that a flaw in the casement or maybe even a lack of foresight in the OG design could've ended up in frying the entire thing. Some years ago, i was talking with a friend who studies lightning and it's not something uncommon, frying cameras...
Ahah I agree with the guy, go straight to the max speed
"Wow, our electric camera isn't fast enough to see electricity!"
9:43 deathly hallows pt2 getting serious vibes rn of voldemorts death scene and fight with Harry in the 4th movie. "YOU'RE A WIZARD, MR. POTTER"
The storage capacity these men must have, and the internal bandwidth to move it around is astonishing.
OK now do it in a vacuum? that would be cool
They all don’t start at the same time, the electricity is running at the speed of light so it all happens faster than 1.75 millionths of a second
9:43 oh look , it's the reverse potter harry
It's called mehhhhhhhhhhdi
Finally. Thank you guys
Would be interesting to see if lightning (the kind that happens from the clouds to the ground outdoors of course) could be shot high speed and slowed down?
el crossover definitivo
Please tech companies make a camera that films 50M per second ASAP haha
Watchin in 0.25x to make it even slower : )
Men will be men
HAHAHAHA!!! The look on his face when he says "let me increase the power a little bit" I'm dying! That was too funny!
If it jumps through air ..what about doing it in vaccum ?
⚡
Speaking from an electromagnetic and electrical engineering specialist background. What people don't realise is that wherever there is charge, there will be current flow of electrons. It's just so slow or small that you can't recognise it many times.   So when lightening or sparks occur, what's happening is all electrons in the air are moving, from even the lowest charge, and as the charge increases, some particles move faster than others and this builds and builds depending on the ionisable properties of particles as well as the electrical charge source. And so the fluff or the "searching" of the electrons really aren't anything to do with lightening finding it's path, but more to do with just the natural already flowing electrons becoming visible due to the increased flow of electrical charge around the visible areas. And charge doesn't flow through the air like one stream, but rather through the entirety of space simultaneously. Think of space itself as made up of like infinite circuits connecting the charge source and it's destination, all in parallel connection with each other and all with differing resistances for the electricity to flow through. And as the electrons increase in flow, these circuits change in their resistance properties.  So the reason the Marx generator goes from the higher voltage side is precisely because all current is flowing at all times from it's source to destination. Of course as the air becomes more and more ionised it becomes more and more like a short circuit. And the air becomes more and more ionised as current is flowing faster and faster, even well before you see any ionisation process happening at all. Think of all the capacitors as already flowing current continually, all charge trying to dissipate constantly and simultaneously from all points at different rates. It makes sense the slip stream of the higher voltage would appear first to ionize.
I have a feeling that when they do have the immensenly advanced camera technology too catch this speed of light. It will show the light actually traveling in reverse. That be really cool.
I love how sarcastic Electro is 😂
I can slow it x2 times more
More electro boom with slow motion
this video is pure art of nature, it was amazing to see nyquist's theorem proved in such a visual way
Absolutely love ElectroBOOM. I'm with Dan. I never made that connection about hot air rising either. Until now.
This proves the theory that energy in mass is a stored constant, and when a potential charge is applied to the circuit, it dumps instantaneously rather than "flowing".
What's the velocity?! That's what I want to know. I don't know the distance.
we could use tesla coil styled technology to capture in a non lethal way. sort of like a tazer.
guys trust after 2 days, touch this lightning. OK
at 3:57, played back it slow speed, it appears the corona that forms along the electrode moves backward toward the coil, after the discharge breaks out
The slomo guys and electroboom together!!! booooom
Is Dan wearing a Tissot T-Touch Expert?
This is the most I've ever seen Mehdi smile ever on a video🤯
I love the little turn Dan’s head does when Mehdi says he’s increasing the power a little bit.
Subscribing to both channels. ​Listeners are urged not to notify newspapers or police. Again! Listeners are urged not to notify newspapers or police.
WOW, that was great, I had a tesla coil that would produce 4ft streamers. Hint, Hint you guys !! To view the vortex of a strimmer coming off a smooth sphere would be spectacular. I use to watch this electrical tornado thru a spotting scope. Especially when streamers coalesce into one trunk. ElectroBoom will know what I'm talking about.🌪🌀🙂🙃🙂
5:25 Looks Fake Asf😂 Almost Like CGI                      Source- Im High
Awesome video indeed! Definitely cool af seeing all three of you guy’s together on a project.
Can it be that the resistance in the last cap is lower due to a lower chargelevel? And the first spark comes over ground plane.
If i show this to my phisics teacher he would probably give a good grade on the electricity leçon
Talk about a dream team! Please do more together! This is fantastic!
What your seeing as it dims and Brightens at million is the Coil Charging and Discharging
Electronic Arts at 1,750,000FPS
The concept of watching AC being AC is just... 🤯
Everybody gangsta till you have to pay the electricity bill
"KING OF SLOW MOTION" 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Isn't the stages of the Marx generator triggered by radiation from the previously triggered stages? That would explain the "absence" of delay. Literally close to the speed of light!
Speed of light part 2?  😏
ElectroBOOM makes everything better
This is why science and nature are amazing
Gotta bump it up to a million 🤔 or something.
I think we just witnessed a melding of minds THIS is what scientific studies should be like the passion the joy the sloppy shirts!!
Nice
An excellent and funny video :) that little jump at 4:23 was so genuine :D
The minute I saw him I thought "Wires are gonna pop."
It looked like the last electric boom not the last one the one before the last one it only light up half of the way
Heat up the air before the time
Electro Boom!!! My inspiration for blasting things😂😂😂
Imagine watching in 2x and ruining their whole career.
I don't think light has a speed. I think it works instantaneously. This world is literally being formed by the light that illuminates it.
Is that really safe though? Really low and really high frequencies are safe, but gradually scaling up from ≈1Hz to kHz while touching means you pass the frequencies around 50Hz which is really harmful to your heart...
Uhm I think meghi and stryopro may be able to fix the charging mechanism problem rail guns are having
70k Times slower. And ITS look normal, what a light!!
I love electro boom videos😆😀😀
0:01 I am the first time comment
"I don't think you can upload videos more than 12 hours." Says Gav.  Didn't 6 years prior you uploaded 19 1/2 hours of uneditted Slow Mo footage of a pyrex handle shattering?
7:43 that face XD
You are thinking of electricity in conventional theory, think about electron theory, in reality electricity flows from negative to positive
Hi Mehdi, nice to see you here <3
awesome collaboration guys!
i think they all forgot until nearly the end of the video, electricity runs at the speed of light...i would enjoy such a video, but it was be very long!
So nobody else felt the super awkward energy in this video? 👀
7:20 This reminds me of Don't Hug Me I'm Scared episode 4. Search youtube for it and skip to 2:12. 😀
It is my favourite super hero, Mega Hurts!
Spooky action
Mehdis skills feel like a combination of you two's, he fits into the team really well :D
You gave him like 1 second of your footage,  that's cheap
Mehdi! Instant like
Light is still super fast even at slow motion😄
ElectroBOOM my BOOOOY. love him so much <3
I can see Phineas Ferb and perry here Reality check
thank you for the wallpaper images :)
Medhi is part of the reason i was able to repair a wine cooler (thermoelectric cooler/ peltier device)
The best crossover
Best crossover episode EVER. LOL
Somebody tag *VERITASIUM*
Use femtography
the tesla sounds like a guitar solo
The arc pulsating, reminds me of gas bubbles in water pulsating when collapsing. There are some videos of firearms being fired under water. The gas bubbles pulsate a couple of times before disappearing.
I'd love to see the Tesla coil arc behaviour if there was a fine water mist sprayed through its path
i like this
Great cllab . very owesome video
Am I the only one who watches the slomo guys in 2x speed because they are too slow?
Records 1 sec as an 8 hour long video @60fps
I comment to help statistics
Medhi went from blowing things up with electricity, catching things on fire and ruining electronics for years to now being filmed at almost 1 million FPS blowing things up with electricity, catching things on fire and ruining electronics...
The Phantom 7510 has an input port that allows you to trigger the camera via the emi generated from the Marx generator. I’ve done that before and it allowed me to find the exact point where the spark event happened without sifting through the video at all.
Electro boom is my boy he's Fearless
Dan is the test dummy
if you could have 2 cameras film at 1.5 million but at alternating starts could you then get 3 million frames a second? night be impossible to time even with a computer though
I can't believe y'all had ElectroBoom on and didn't slomo some exploding capacitors and whatnot....😔
This might have already been answered, but how much storage was used to save that huge amount of footage? Specifically for Medhi to have to look through.
Brilliant lads. 👍
For me the most amazing thing is the visualization that nature works the same in the small scale here as in the really big version back in the "slow mo guys around the world" series and their video lighting hitting the ocean in Asia.
If you host a livestream of footage and then save it afterwards you can bypass the 12hrs upload limit.
The first time they turned on the coil it sounded like the dracula organ music
I was literally gonna tweet about you guys doing a collab, glad to know my prayers have been answered
This is why I love ElectroBOOM. The fact that he knows so much about electricity and is willing to put himself (or Dan) in the line of fire for our entertainment.
I don't know if you have done this or similar already, but it would be cool to see a close up zoom of a colored liquid absorbing/wicking through various fabrics or materials. I was watching the stretch armstrong episode and when Dan got soaked I wondered what the water soaking into his clothing looked like at THIS Framerate.
Love the team an good information ☺️
I just watched Squirting Cucumber plants and Sandbox Tree seeds exploding and the only thing I could think of was how much I wanted to see them given the full Slow Mo Guys treatment! XD
Hi
Amazing
Hi
Hydraulic Press Channel collab next?? 👀👀
Maybe blowing glass in slow motion could be cool. Like hot glass.
Starts off with innocent instructions, then slowly become the kind of bastardly instructions you'd hear from a trade instructor. Just to see if your dumb enough to do it.
TUTORIAL FOR THE TESLA COIL PLEASE
Hi, maybe next collaboration will be with Hydraulic Press? I'd love to see Most Explosive Ball Bearing in details.
Good
The most underrated colab that would ever happen ❤️
Is the vid trimmed cuz it was playing the pink panther song? Was it getting striked or something?
The power of arc/electric is beautiful.
"Oh sugaa"
U 3rd guy, u from india bro ?? (me too)
A somewhat lesser confusing way to conceptualise why an arc will jump to a conductive surface is by making parallels to materials cracking and how they might crack due to a change in width or due to an internal void.  Its not like the crack knows where to go, it just finds the areas that take the lowest amount of energy to rip apart, once it reaches the end of the material the crack opens up which is basically what electricity does.
Instant like. I just know it is going to be good. And funny.
maybe you can try filming welding, especially AC/ alluminium welding.
We need to be more thankful that ElectroBOOM hasn't ended up as some sort of mad scientist.
Do it Guys! Together! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqv1jApvtA&ab_channel=HydraulicPressChannel
This process could show how mars got its global scar.
"420" KHz let's go bros
10:39 consistency is everything!
How are things in Austin?
I have to get one of these cameras.
Pretty cool. As of my viewing you only need 17,130 more views to match the max FPS speed
ElectroBOOM and SMG 🔥🔥
its not Electroboom without the boom
I think the internal arcs are so bright, they photo-initiate neighboring arcs.
Gav, an idea for a video would be different welders and the arc between MIG, flux core, and TIG while welding. But I’m sure there would be challenges with exposure, as always.
A a QCW quarter wave coil is more as Tesla intended
"i drive a Ferrari, but I've never used 6th gear"
SOOOOOO COOOOOOL~ Awesome video guys, thanks!
Can you make Expensive ball bearings vs hydrolic press machine
As a welder this is something I've always wanted to see, thank you for this
The reason the arcs don't occur in a sequence along the resistor ladder...  there's no voltage drop across resistors when there's no current.  The arc-gaps all reach the same breakdown voltage at the same time regardless of resistor values.  After the arcs start, then there's current, and then the resistor value limits the current which is why arcs at one end are brighter than at the other end.
Its like a slime mould!
This reminds me a little bit of the slo mo lightning strike they did a while ago.
Using a camera as an oscilloscope is pretty wild.
I'm guessing that the reason they see the last spark gap in the Marx generator is the first one to flash-over is because that particular spark gap may be slightly shorter than all the other gaps. That would be easy to measure with a digital caliper. (Be careful not to shock yourself, Mehdi!) LOL
I can clearly see, that ElectroBoom is very stressed in this video
6:35 Gav sounded particularly american here
Yeni video atınca 28 kat daha yavaşlattın  yeni videoda
ON/OFF hz cycles as the current is pushing against the resistive force of the ozone. as the ozone is super heating it is creating a less resistive path each time with the cycles peak the arch crept closer.
I'm right with Dan on hot air rising. Makes intuitive sense, but I didn't expect that was why electricity always goes upward in an arc.
Imagine if teleporters are invented. 1. Youtube Collabs will hit a rate of exponential growth 2. Slow mo guys will make sick videos of it 3. ElectroBoom will explode it  Edit: And How Ridiculous will drop a teleporter into a teleporter at 200ft
Mehdi's excitement is palpable. Working with this every day and now knowing the secret slow motion world buried underneath must be so exciting.
That was fun.  Top marks, gentlemen.  Thank you
It's quite strange to watch at them because they are old now. The last time I watched the Slow Mo Guys was when they were young. Long time, eh.
Hey guys, The Hydraulic Press channel needs your help: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqv1jApvtA
I don't know if Dan will speak to me after going through so much pain!
This was very interesting, thanks for sharing
Video has 1.7 million views.. Nice coincidence
I dont know exactly how sensor works on your camera, but may be it is due to sensor scanning from right to left. thats why last one arcs first. may be turning setup 180 degree will show different results. just a thought.
https://youtube.com/shorts/wrbp2qq8Z2M?feature=share Can u guys see this under slow mo camera
Oh neat you guys did this on my birthday
Please try this with a lazer
Guys... Hydraulic Press Channel needs you.
wow that was astonishing!
Collab with HPC ???
4-5 inches is a lot
Maybe the last gap arcs first because it's a slightly shorter gap?
Love the video  Maybe try recording lichtenberg burning, im sure it would look incredible at 1.75M fps
Really enjoyable when these well known science geeks team up.  Good stuff
That was awesome. When will Slo Mo Guys meet Hydraulic Press Channel???
do the same experiment in a vacuum chamber if possible and check the results :]  please think about it
I believe the arc follows the path of the previous arc due to the temporary ionization of the N2/O2 molecules in the path of the first arc. The heat produced causes the ionized air to rise and thus the following arcs will rise with it.
Another great vid lads. I think I'm a long-time watcher and first-time commentator. Luv the addition of Medhi. Just a thought/question. The spark at the end of Mark's generator; Could that have anything to do with a magnetic field extending from the connecting ground wire? I noticed it wasn't insulated. Pls, excuse my lack of electrical wisdom.
16:43 The clip insert of the time difference of '30 minutes later' really should have been the French accented 'A few minutes later' that is used a lot 😁
15:33 Those spark gaps are not the same distance, the last one fired first possibly because it looks like it is very narrow compared to the rest....(My observations)
Jake Gyllenhaal, Joe Mantegna and I can't recognize this lord of electricity in the make-up.
I wonder what Benjamin Franklin would have made of this.... It would have made his day, that's for sure....〽⚡  Awsome these guys getting together....😃
This video now makes me wonder what a jacobs ladder looks like at high speed as it falls onto someone.
при скорости 900.000 кадров в секунду, мы будем видеть Свет лет9ший со скростью звука (дл9 человека)   осталось  найти камеру котора9 сможет делать столько кадров в сек и снимать пезаж как первые лучи солнца со скоростью звука распростран9ютс9 по пол9не,   когда достингем планки 10.000.000 кадров в сек,  свет станет дл9 нас со скростью как лихачь на КАДе  в крайней левой
Hi Guys this si must filming :) https://youtu.be/vaLh78WIH14
FINALY
Awesome. The slow mo lightning capture was one of my favorite vids.  Electrical arcs are cool.
Imagine how cool it would be to see a laser pointers light move slowly across your screen
The current, which is producing a plasma, is in dark mode while it travels from the left to the right, when it reaches the end and arts to the final target, the plasma then switches to Glow mode and you see the light
might it be that the light from the last one reached the camera a tiny bit sooner than the others, and was not actually firing first?
You guys should write a simple script that calculates consecutive frame similarity (a basic metric like L1 or L2 norm should be fine), and use it to find the action in the slowmo for you. Should be quite straightforward.
this is even more interesting than cat videos
love the colab :)
You got to get your CalTech pals to film it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ys_yKGNFRQ
how would it react in a vacuum?
3 educated crack heads in one video. Amazing
"My f-cking brain cells!" - Mehdi
You should reach out to Houston Jones. He does interesting videos and I think Dan could use a break from being the one who gets hurt all the time. Houston Jones would gladly volunteer.
i like this guy and his use of the Nyquist sampling theorem
It would be interesting to see the welding arc from the electrode :O
The fluff   That is the superposition of the electron   Electron cannot be distinguished   That look at that mans face was in denials    Having understood but yet not fully realized.  What they measured, what you saw, and what was just discovered   If you take this one step further and introduce the electrical equivalent of a double slit   You may unlock the next leap in human advancement.  Rivaled perhaps only the mastery of fire, or the splitting of the atom .    Got mafs?    :)
Loco porque no traducen los videos... es un garron
Can you guys partner with this guy to crush a bunch of stuff @ 500k+ fps? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaLh78WIH14
"seems like its running at the speed of light almost" LMAO
Recently saw a closeup of wire cut with a side cutter. Please do a slow mo closeup the snap.
Best collab ever 😁
Nice video 👍
Wait. If electrons are traveling at the speed of light, your camera has no chance of adequately recording it. It just seems like everything is happening at the same time, when in fact it needs a much faster camera. :)
Stop the goofing around guys, what you're exposing here is incredible.
I want a faster camera! :D
Thank you for the attempt! The speed on this one is electrifying :D
Don't press this time, DANGER!  >>>12:46
this is alot of fun to watch
What I want to know is if electricity will choose hot air or ionised air for its pathing
The collaboration we didn't ask for but needed the most
Phantom makers...  Game on
Medhi finally said what we knew from the beginning: a foot per nanosecond is faster than a frame per microsecond
electroboom always reminds me of that one uncle that always DIY things - awesome collab i havnt seen in ages
With the cappacior bank, if one flashes, the current generates a magnetic field that travels with light speed to all the others, that will rise their voltages an make them spark as well. It is how Hetz build the first radio transmitter/receiver: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spark-gap_transmitter. So all the others look simultaneous but are firered with the speed of light all triggerd from the first one that sparks.  B.t.w the one with the smalles distance between the electrodes will sparc first and initiate the rest.
The Quest For The Clock Speed Of The Universe...  Seriously, it does make me wonder: there must be some theoretical limit to frame rates based on the fastest possible operation of the physics of the camera components. Is it the Planck Time that limits it? The speed of light? A combination of both? I'd love to know.
Please do this test https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaLh78WIH14
To get higher frame rates than even this camera can show, you just need a super duper short exposure and to set the electrical arcs to a slightly different frequency than the camera's frame rate. That will allow you to capture one frame of a different instant of each separate but similar arc. The best way to achieve this would probably be to use a mirrorless camera with universal shutter and build a circuit which outputs a pulse to the camera's trigger at the same time as the high voltage arc generator.
I love this mashup 😂
Very cool! Love the videos!
Is that the guy that shocks himself ALL the time?  Lol
The collab that I didn't expect to see on this channel, but i'm really enjoying it so much
Anyone else watch Gavin on ragequit like 10 plus years ago
That Tesla's dropping a sick beat
wizards 😂
Guy already earned a sub cause I love electrical stuff.... But when he tricked you out with the ohh right there. I went instantly to sub without even checking out his channel.
Guys why don't you invite some one who has a hydraulic press and who can press ball bearings? There is a guy that uses his hydraulic press but he doesn't have a high end slow motion camera and the ball bearing explosion in slow motion is not captured as it should be.... take a look https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaLh78WIH14  It will be interesting to see what is happening to the ball bearings in slow motion!
Any chance you could show a lathe at full speed and how it works.????
Smiled like an idiot through this whole video, enjoy it thoroughly. Must definitely team up with @ElectroBOOM More often!!!
You should do a nuclear bomb in 1.75m
Amazing collab!
Fun fact: real electric sparks look exactly like electric sparks from 1980s B-movies!
1 sec = 1 t of storage full
fun fact electrons move at 2200km/s and it's different from the ionized that you're looking for, a smaller circuit will be slower but idk by how much
https://youtu.be/OhNEZfG4EHU macro slowmo would be awesome seeing things like the but that last moment sheer in slow mo.
THIS GUY!!!!! I love seeing his facebook posts...the electric guitar is my fav lmao
Hook up an oscilloscope!
I want to see welding in slo mo
Slo Mo octopus changing colors!!!
Just use an Osciloscope and you can see in Gigaframes.
10:24 Lightning: Exists  Gav: "... as it slowly makes its way over..."  One of the few times I've ever heard electricity described as slow
Why dont you just do the max FPS to start with?
At that framerate, light travels at about 170 m/s. That's just astounding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaLh78WIH14&ab_channel=HydraulicPressChannel
Wow ! I know ... speechless. Thank You
I love your videos but I'm curious about the price of TMX 7510 ? Does anyone know how much is it worth ?
9:30.., I'd have laughed up a lung if the coil was running and got Dan on the lips.
Love this, what a Team!
*@**05:25** does it really creating that electro sound i do not know what to call it.*
1:54 yä yä
Wow, it's at 1.75 Mill FPS and the bolts are sstill going a bit fast, this may have to be revisted at a later date when there is an even faster camera.
Love this collaboration. Thanks!
Dear "The Slow Mo Guys" I have a technical question.  When you're recording with 1,750,000FPS, what is the size in megabyte or gigabyte with one shot? For example the last one with the chain reaction. It must be huge!
NOW Mehdi, you need to do is with a really big and much longer Marx Generator !
if the arc is directly on the hand it is hurt him but not if he holds the screwdriver why?
OMG my two favourite science YouTubers at once😍
9:41 Harry Potter
I imagine the whole setup creates one electric field where any effects propagate at the speed of light.
This goes to show the better we get with technology and the more we try to understand the universe, the more we realise that we know less and less than we thought.
13:00 Known in the trade as "letting the smoke out."
Forgetting to divide by 2 is a classic in STEM lmao
9:41 Dan putting out some Voldemort vibes
Is it just me or does Dan looks like Q from Impractical Jokers
It's so cool how nature provides you with a relaxing soundtrack whenever you're in slow mo.
Love called :)
Wow! Just astonishing
So fun to see electroboom with other hosts
Hey guys, have you ever seen the Hydraulic Press Channel? I think if possible you guys collaborating would be incredible, to see how things like ball bearings fail in ultra slow motion. Take a look!  https://youtu.be/vaLh78WIH14
Am I a sinner for watching this in fast-forward?
Could you double a phantoms speed if you had two?  Use  two  cameras to shoot the same subject with a mirror and then  start one right after the first frame of the other and then use software to interlace the two cameras every other frame. I'm not sure if the frame pacing is precise enough tho
Very cool
Way too much BS, nonsense and banter.These are wanna-be scientists not REAL and serious ones. They are more like high school teenagers with their inane hysterical laughter of things not funny at all. . I wanted info, not endless, truly dumb banter.
They should make Tesla coils fire alarms, so they electrocute people in a fire
I don't claim to understand all that science stuff, but it was a neat video =)
What kind of electricity are you using in this? What is current, voltage, resistance, and picture of the circuit diagram for this.
Avenger is gonna be the best teamup ever Mehdi: Hold my screwdriver!
11:30 "So the camera and the Tesla coil aren't broken"...  I did not hear 'Tesla coil' the first time I listened...
3:25 The face 🤣
Guys, I'd love to see a super slomo video if a Jacob's ladder
AND.....it's purple xD
clearly electroboom was hired to develop the 16pin NVidia cable.
This is an interesting demonstration of electron flow theory vs conventional flow
can you tell the numbers of the resistor ? not to me  to your fans
wow  what is the speed of light not hertz  fotons resonanse friquency you macink a vid about electricity no one said OM WATT VOLT
how come you dont try it bear feet no shoes. this is not a Faradey cage do you want non educated audionce?
5:25 Hyper Beam!!
Gav, Dan, Next time do the exploding card press from the end of this video: https://youtu.be/19s8CRUVf3E
I can explain the reason the last one arcs first. Message me.
2,2 seconds. This maneuver will cost us 40 hours
Please go to Finland and do a Collaboration with the Hydraulic Press Channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaLh78WIH14!  PLEASE!!
Love your guys' videos!  Have you ever recorded the Prince Ruperts Drop shatter?
nice
So... they have this amazing camera technology but still upload at 50fps...?
best possible start of a science video 0:04
OK, so this is unrelated to this video. But you need to help these Finns out! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaLh78WIH14
2nd best video of all time: slomo guys exploding capacitors 1st best video of all time: slomo guys and medi sparkling this now you guys need to get to 10M to 50M fps
this is a great video.. i've only seen this guy in compilations where he shocks himself for like 15 minutes at a time so it's cool to find out more about the guy.. only thing that kinda bothers me is when you cut across the 180 line at 16:15 to yourselves facing the other way.. just doesn't feel right but hey 🤷‍♂ awesome content as always ✌
God is great for inventing such a thing as electricity. I did many videos proving atheists wrongabout everything, like on the big bang which didn't happen as proven by constellations that would have been distorted beyond recognition if  the universe truly exploded. I welcome angry, self-righteous atheists to bark at me, preferrably in a rabid pack.
this is the collab i needed wtf
EA Spark.  It's in the coil
I don't know if the guys do requests, but I'd love to see a see a drummer (Carter Beauford as an example) perform a single stroke roll. All the video I have shows a simple blur
There are camera setups that do 10 Trillion FPS now... that would be isane.
Men☕
I love this guy 😂 he's so funny.
moreee mooorrreeee MOOOOORRREEEEE
Someone  got veritausium
_What could go wrong?_  _Let's find out!_
there's not that big of a difference between ac voltage and dc voltage it's still electricity
It's great that they had some fun, but by watching electroBOOM channel, it becomes apparent that Mehdi is a walking stress inducer 🤣
Slo mo, a ball bearing exploding in a hydraulic press
@6:02 for clarity the arc isn't meeting in the middle, just like lightning, the imaginary corridor of electrons is already flowing invisibly, what then happens is because of resistance the electrons friction heat the air along the path of that imaginary corridor which produces plasma generating light. You see it first where the greatest resistance(s) is and it travels from area of greater heat to that of lesser. In storms this would be from the connection point(cloud) to the ground. Just imagine an invisible wire reaching up and touching the cloud, it then starts glowing at that point with the heat following the wire, eventually glowing all the way to ground. There is an invisible field that has already determined the path of the electrons based on resistance. The charge, believe it or not, actually increases in the point of connection before the electrons have even arrived in response to the change of the field. Kind of like the information arrived before the actual particles.
It feels like electroboom defeated the slow mo guys.
I was cracking up most of this video. Loved every second
I'm at the start of the video and actually really excited to see if the camera can see a difference in time between the sparks.  Voltage propagation down a wire... I want to know if it either occurs at the speed of light, or a speed proportional to the resistance in the wire medium.
❓Any chance you guys can do a sawstop in slow motion❓
that's shocking
if you guys upload the footage then it'd be the new longest second on YT like you did way back then
you guys should video one of those laser rust removal tools in action. just a suggestion
Maybe the one on the end fires first because of a buildup of negative pressure and it's the last one to give so once it finally goes, the others get a huge rush in an instant?
Can I get 69 likes
Would you be able to use that camera to look through a microscope and watch cellular activity in slow motion?
2 awesome channels come together! sweet!!!
a second 9 hours of footage, that's amazing
Yay! ElectroBOOM!!
"pure unedited reality"
At 9:47 I don't see a Tesla coil I see a rebel laser cannon on Hoth.
Dan should have known he was in danger when they teamed of with the professional at shocking himself for kicks
I want to see the graveyard of capacitors this guy has blown up 😂
Next Collab should be with the hydraulic press channel, to do some shots of the ball bearing exploding among other things
So electricity is faster than light?
Beginning stages of the creation of Lightning Gun from Unreal Tournament 2004.
Nice       Very nice
Jesus died and was raised again according to the scriptures, believe that and you shall be saved.
Very interesting
Great Video Guys!. You guys really need to do this one  Hydraulic Press Vs. Most Explosive Ball Bearing |1500 frames per second!
MEGAFRAMES
I believe that the idea is this: The source field, electrifies out to a point of conduction, and Then the two meet in the middle and go away from each other. At the end the outside arc comes back, to the source, and withdraws all along the same "hollow" path
1.8 days in ≈2 seconds...wow!
I LOVE THESE CHANNEL...  SO SATISFYING
I'm shocked. wow you made beat.
6:04 вау в это отрезке видно наводки в отвёрике лол
BEST COLAB EVER
nothing change electro booms intro XD
This is a collaboration no one expected
the master is afraid of electricity
When two content creators meet each other: - I like your videos! - Thanks, I like your videos too!
So cool video, I've been trying too like the video several times 😂
Brilliant…⚡️
where is the Limit for high frames Cameras? This immens of Data...i cant imagine how this is even possibel to record this amount of frames. How much costs this Setup?
Love to see a ball bearing in a hydraulic press, see how it splinters, maybe a sheet of glass
Warning: Don't smoke weed before doing high voltage science xD
This channel always has a hidden theme "torturing Dan"
So, if I'm understading this right, as electricity is expelled, it branches out to equal paths of least resistance. The further it travels down one path, the more energy will follow it down that path. It's not so much that the other branches hit a proverbial brick wall so much as they encounter _some_ resistance, and in that time, one or more paths end up traveling far enough that energy stops going to those other branches because the energy has to follow the existing arcs.  If we imagine a room full of air as a room full of various viscous materials, and the path the electricity takes like someone trying to walk through it in a full-body suit, you'd have points where the person found patches of thicker material or outright solid objects, but a path would form. That's the path the electricity wants to take when the next electrical charge is expelled. But because the electricity heated up the air, the pressure changes so the path isn't exactly the same because other gases are being pushed into the space due to the hot air moving. Sort of like if the viscous room analogy were allowed to settle a bit before the next person went through, the path might not be exactly the same because some of the thicker material might encroach more on the path, or pool on the ground making it more difficult to lift your feet with each step.  It all appears random because we can't see the gases in the air that might be affecting the path that the electrical arcs take, and because the electricity itself is changing the air it's discharged into, that _further_ contributes to the random nature of the paths the electrical arcs take. With the electricity arcing out the same way multiple times because, regardless of whether a path offers the greatest _distance,_ it's not trying to get from point A. to point B. it's just moving via whatever path is *available* to it. So even though it *seems* like distance is of no consequence given how absurdly fast it travels, its movements arn't much different from flowing water, just on a 3 dimensional plane and unaffected by gravity.
It'd be dope to see a video done with a hydraulic press in slow motion.
Shocking.
Lol we already knew this Google says electricity moves about the same as speed of light 600 million miles
I'm curious  what would be seen if it was striking water
It wouldn't have felt like a proper Mehdi/ElectroBOOM featured video if he didn't at shock himself at least once or break something :)
So cool... Imagine being the first ever to hear those step tones rise it's beautiful
Good onya Dan !  a proper scientist.
I watched this at 1.5x speed, and all my back-of-the-envelope calculations were off.
The wtf did you get me into look @4:54
I thought it was cool. I'll look at the other video to see if my theory was correct. I decided to just put it on here 1st. The theories are. 1: the distance between the last set are just a little closer than the others and theory 2 : the last 2 may be in the opposite of positive and negative so it pulls it from the other end. I'll get back to looking for it.
This is my fav slow mo ever
Can we use a laser pointer in such a case to send a current at the speed of light through a laser to a tesla coin?
Electricity moves so fast I think it is impossible to see it with current technology
It's my understanding that the final cap triggering first is because current is the flow of electrons which are negatively charged, so the physical path of the current is from the negative terminal  to the positive terminal. Please do correct me if im wrong, I am not a physicist nor an electrician.
Loved this collab. Slow mo guys always staying fresh
Not sure, but I think this may be kinda groundbreaking. This may be the only footage of this ever seen by anyone, ever!
So....based on proof of concept...how could this be used to trap lightning to charge a battery...?  Or a reactor.  I'm thinking of that place in South America that gets lightning, like, 400% more than any other point on the planet.  Now, it's just a matter of scale.
That moment you realize that the arcs resemble the Galactic filaments🤯
This guy is a treasure and anyone who invites him for a YouTube project wins a good time 😂👌🏻👌🏻
I’ve been watching since I was 6, glad to see you guys are still rocking to this day!
Can an algorithm be put on the camera that auto finds the action within millions of frames by a delta between frames?
Gavin: I don't think you can upload a video longer than 12 hours anymore.  What, did YouTube have a massive fit at the length of Uno: Infinite?
11:36 - The fundamental constants aren't broken at least...
I would like to see this in a vacuum chamber or inside a chamber with different gases.
VERY fun video to watch! I wonder how many theories were just confirmed, and how many were just debunked! VERY cool to watch. I really wish high-speed cameras like this were available to mere mortals 47 years ago when I built my own Tesla Coil for my school science project.
dan's got more photos than marilyn monroe
Mehdi and Slow Mo Guys are a great combo
"Seems like it's running at the speed of light, almost" 😂😂😂😂😂💀
How many gigs was that 4 million frames?
''just dont punch the tesla coil'' idk why but that was fun to me
Too much talking 🥱
That’s cool!
Crazy how far the cameras have come. I remember when 100k or even 10k fps was a big deal. Now they casually film at a million fps.
Anyone else watching the tesla coil remembering their days playing red alert and realizing thing as a weapon isn't far fetched.
The lightning and the glass cracking videos were by far my favorite two videos so far on this channel.
short circuit 450v capacitor at slow mo
7:55 Medhi just dropping Nyquist all casual.
Shame this was done at 50fps.
WHAT AN AMAZING COLLAB 2 of my favourites
What is causing the electricity to actually arc? Like instead of going in a straight line it's like it's bending around invisible space.
electricity flows at 186,000 mps; so it would traverse the sequence in something near 1 to 2 nanoseconds
You know you just prove that electricity is like other water, a medium with viscosity. Maybe you will get the Nobel Prize.
05:27 — Thor summoning his Hammer (Mjolnir)
awesome!  No other words to describe watching an arc trying to find a path.!!! AWESOME!!!
Very impressed
16:17 "So our biggest struggle CURRENTLY......." And no one acknowledged the pun?
True Scientists, suffering for the sake of knowledge. Thank you for your sacrifice, Gentlemen.
very cool I wonder what it would like in a vacuum
Isn't that guy dangerous?
It's obvious that the last right most side capacitor would go out first because it completes the circuit when the charge it full and pressure at Max. For electrons, there ain't no walls, when pressure is high, it tunnels through trying to complete the circuit to jump to the nearest exit, in this case the right most arc exit.
In the first few seconds, ElectoBOOM, always the showman!
I need a super slow motion shot of Gav's face at 16:40 "you serious" "no"
transparent fire piston close-up.
Honestly I think a 12 hour video about the best 631mS section of the 1,75M slo-mo of the tesla’s coil would be sick just because you can. Even if it isn’t much more then a good background video to play throughout the day if you’re into that sort of thing.
"If you account for the curves and such it's probably 6 to 7 inches" 😭
best video so far.
Electricity, no idea how it works...it may as well be magic to me.
Was the arc from the screwdriver before or after the first strike? It had to have a positive or negative charge and want to fix its charge to balanced
Try running the plasma through different gases like a plasma ball in slowmo (neon, argon, helium, etc)!
So in regard to how hard it is to find a particular moment within so much video of just same thing, you could theoretically design a piece of software that could read it for you and output timestamps indicating where any kind of "different" footage was detected. You would just set up the video so that the first few frames or few 1000 frames set your baseline and the algorithm would then compare that to all the rest of the frames.  Just a random thought lol, I'm a software engineer professionally so whenever I hear a problem like what you guys experienced finding footage in a huge unwieldy amount of video I always think "how could the computer do it for me?" lol.  Loved this experiment y'all did, was really awesome seeing the resonance frequency in the tesla coil output. I was not expecting to see that at all. It's my dad who is the electrical engineer in my family haha, he would be your colleague Mehdi xD. Cheers!
You should do it again in a vacuum and watch the surprise.
i wonder how it look like a ball bearing explode with hydraulic press under the slow motion.
I think that this is the only video that electroBOOM has not been shocked on camera.
Outstanding video guys!
Technical remark: assuming Medhi's circuit is a standard spark gap voltage multiplier, the arc that goes first is probably the one in the narrowest gap. I wonder what happens if you change the gap a tiny bit.
9:48 Harry... I mean, Dan Gruchy and the Coil of Tesla
What I learned is that Medhi is exactly as socially awkward as I had expected he would be.  This is one of my favourite collabs I've seen. I sub to both channels already and was excited when I saw ElectroBOOM in the title of a slowmo video.
So the Tesla coil is flickering because it is AC. But why is lightning flickering?
"You're imediately one of the most photographed people in history" What a profound thing to say on a whim. And true. Lol
I read the title as "Electronic Arts" as in "EA Games" lol. :)
When we talk of electricity, we mustn't think of it as an actual thing, flowing through the air. Because what it is, is describing a change in the state of matter of the air, the change is going through. With this change traveling from an anode but then and once it makes contact with the cathode, creates a circuit. With a negative return also being withing the same structure of the discharge and so is a mechanism to balance charge between two points. And so, is not a power dump in a single direction, like water down a plughole. Instead, it is a circuit, a Birkeland current and so has the charge moving in both directions through it. There are three types of Plasma Discharge Mode, Mode 1 (dark mode), where there isn't enough charge density in the discharge to be seen in visible to human wavelengths of the EM Spectrum. PDM 2 (glow mode) and where the discharge starts to tighten, with the charge density increasing and so we can start to see the discharge and PDM 3 (arc mode) and where the discharge is high powered. With the magnetic fields created by the discharge, then pulling it into a very tight strike.
Wow. Made me think of great scientists like Tesla, Einstein, etc visualising stuff in their heads. And that goes to show power of the human mind.

Can i suggest Lihong Wang's camera?
9:42 Expecto............. Patronum!!!
Just film how the light travels next.
It is innate to find the path of least resistance. At least for water/fluids, sound and electricity.
Please, tell me about the "Whiskers" on the coil side electrode???????????????????
I would like to have seen highest speed footage of the Tesla coil discharge into the air, where it takes many paths, instead of just the single arc path to the screwdriver.
We need to keep this channel alive. Imagine the possibilities after some decades.
I've continued journaling digitally last May of 2022 and it truly helped me with all of my anxieties every day. I can write down everything confidently. I use the Daylio app and it's a well-made diary-journal app for anyone who wants to keep their thoughts secret. :)
It would be cool to see the effects of significant temperature differences of the path of the arc.. like have a piece of Dry Ice held above the end electrode, and see if the arc goes through it, or around it.. Maybe try with a PC fan blowing across the path of the arc, to constantly move the arc-heated air away.. Then try the fan with the Dry Ice vapour too..
I like the experiments of both parties very much and I like to see them working together.  Just for the measurement of the sequence of sparks in the second part they could have taken an old cheap multichannel  oscilloscope to achieve a 100 times higher resolution or 10000 times higher resolution with a high end type. (Knowing the results you can adjust the comparably slow optical experiment accordingly. Maybe "the signal path" has a solution.)   :o)
Should hook up with the hydraulic press channel and squash and blow up ball bearings
Pshhhh that was wayyyyy longer than 4-5 inchs
When my grandparents were building their house in the 1970s. They had a friend that was an electrician hook their house up. Apparently he thought the line was dead...it wasn't. The screwdriver he had in his hand, the metal literally vaporized...he actually survived this with minor injuries from what I'm told.
Everytime ElectroBOOM is somewhere it makes me happy and I need to watch it.
What a shocking Collab.
This video would get so bright. It literally ate some battery% on my phone?!
Hydraulic Press Channel just did a video about exploding ball bearings.  INSANE.  Replicating this at the speeds you shoot would be incredible.
hasn't pass one week since this video was posted and is already over 1million views o.o
did anyone else only learn what dan said at the end, AS dan said it, i feel really dumb now
I know this is a dumb question:   How does the arc know your hand is there to shock you? Does it have to do with our body gives of a small electrical charge which allows the arc to reach my hand?
Watching them trolling each other was hilarious. I learned a lot!
Build a program that senses different in brightness of the frames so you don't have to search
I hope electro boom doesn't die soon from electricity, he's super smart and funny af
Medi.  Your Marx generator, Electrons come from the ground not the power source, there should be higher flux at the end and a trigger.  Least that is what I would presume from theories I have heard on how electricity behaves.
It would be interesting to see how a bike wheel works in slow motion, especially the spokes. Just an idea, love your videos.
This has truly been the most informative thing I've ever watched, thank you
I want to see a Slow motion of a TEA N2 Laser hitting the Tesla coil top.  It should create a direct, straight line as the TEA ionizes the air and since you have a channel I want to see if the Picosecond pulse allows the laser to get stronger as it may lase the Air channel itself.
Coolest videos on internet. THANK YOU GUYS
the breakthrough will come when the camera can capture that at an atomic level until then time travel will have to wait
This was so very awesome, great pairing up! Thanks for the video.
Such a lovely crossover
Can you make an accurate measurement of speed of light now
it would be interesting if you used a physical photon filter for your camera lense to see more possible details in the arc? Looks like there might be something hidden in the time that the arc blows out the exposure on your frames.
I wish the guest would STFU. That guy is annoying asf
Everybody tends to make fun of his antics (read: getting constantly zapped) but he really knows how electricity works. Nicola Tesla would be proud! 😎👍
500m? fps
16:00 cuz the last one needed less energy to actives
Slow!
Interesting!  Does material used for arcs wears out?
Make me shocked in slow motion!
Do plasma globes also go on and off faster then eyesight can see. Or is it a nice string of constant electricity like it seems.
on youtube's 60fps limit
First lightning hacked that monitor
Y’all should go and talk to Styropyro and see what he can do with his lasers
The collab we all been waiting for lmao
hats Off for GAV doing Good Mythical Morning and Slomo Guys aswell xD
Wowwww!! 😮 their literally going off simultaneously. It's like the capacitors wont get enough charge to fire until their all full and once the least charged one is full it sets them all off at once 😮
Ohhh I was right! 😀 it is doing that because of resonance. That's legiiiiiit 😮 makes me wanna do myself the Tesla coil shocks 😛
not very interesting nor entertaining. channels shouldint mingle
Hey Guys. Can y’all team up with this guy?! Link below.  I would love too see these ball bearings being crushed with your camera. Its so fast that with his camera its gone in less than 1 frame !! https://youtu.be/vaLh78WIH14
You probably need 300 billion frames per second.
👍👍
Could you do a video where you put different things in a mouse trap?
I’ve always wondered what splitting wood with an axe would look like.
Hey I think a super cool Video would be to film Machining in slow motion... Close ups as well as just the pure madness of high pressure, high rpm CNC madness:D Love your videos
Slow mo guys  Do one of someone spitting to see what that looks like in slow mo
11:30 thats what i thought. The energy was like a tide but at an INSANE level of speed. Each time it surges into the tip of that the air gets energized. It eventually flashes past into a plasma giving off light but it happens so fast. Each time that surge happens its so fast- you know my brain is fried trying to process what im saying and what i saw lol. And to think your brain goes and lets off tiny electrical and chemical charges at a tiny scale EVERY NANOSECOND OF OUR LIVES.
Do a collab with the hydraulic press channel
I'm so glad this video was made.
7:21 *PLAY AT 2x SPEED LOL*
Do you hear the music the electricity playing? That is amazing!
I am so happy I came across this channel.. I love the videos you guys put out!
I didn't know ElectroBOOM was so good at physics, makes sense though
Hey, looks like his own videos!  -let's see if tha... Boom.
Could you film two entangled photons and show us wether they communicate truly faster than light ?
thank you guys , i wonder only what whould Tesla achived with this tehnology , and i love to watch storms.
Subscribed from Medhi's channel. Amazing slowmo.
What was the speed of the electric arc ?
13:05 Did you hear that America? "Solder" has an *_L_* in it. Learn from Mehdi.  Mehdi knows.
7:22 indian trucks horn or what ??? XD
Dragons breath shotgun round into spray paint can!
Lets try to do the same thing but with an wire will it power?
Mehdi is a great addon! 👌
BEST COLLAB EVER!!!!
Do you want me to touch it? The question he should be asking is, do I want to touch it? It's just occurred to me that Dan is the Andrew Ridgley of YouTube.
4:51 “Am I going to die?” Face 😂
great cross guys !! we love you!
I know nothing about electricity but I just love watching ElectroBOOM
Very informative, great video.
i'm not an electrical engineer but if that coil is creating music the way that an electronic instrument does i'd guess it flickers like that because all waves are made of smaller sine waves so we're basically seeing the small very fast rise and fall in charge caused by them which is also why the sounds produced by the coil are so rich in overtones
ENER's power has been so underestimated by Oda
2 of my favorite channels did a video together AMAZING!!!
You guys should record some ball bearings getting crushed in a hydraulic press! I've yet to see a high speed of that
This is so interesting! with the footage from 500Kfps/s it looked like how a lightning behaves but slower, it's amazing that we can see that effect from discharges/lightning with the human eye but not with other arcs like tesla coils, that makes me wanna look up if discharges/lightning are at a specific frequency cause we can see it like that
I love how mehdis
Mind blown!!!! Wow...
Dan is Expendable
maybe the last thing uttered by a human in the universe  will be "it's working" ..... :) lol
8:38 couldn’t agree with you more 😂
Best crossover
Every single thing in the universe and in our minds is driven by this phenomenon.
Y’all should do hitting a baseball with a bat
Just boys being boys
I will give this a stab; we can not build nature or natural conduction. The timing on a device made by them has to determine the devices on the line because it is limited to that device, but nature is unlimited, so it is fluid. When you build a machine, it is controlled within a box; it does not have a free range like nature, So within the device. When creating things, human nature tends to make things with the idea of controlling things. We limit ourselves, our minds, and the experiment. Try building without limiters.
When the slow motion footage was playing, with the tranquil bgm, I had goosebumps. Sometimes when the world is slowed down, we can see more hidden details of the already known.
it still blows my mind how we are even able to film things this fast
Gavin is this what you meant in F***face about having to time slow mo guys guests with camera rental availability to film on specific days? Makes sense now.
If I watch at 0.25x do I get 7.5 mil fps?
There is a camera that films at 70,000,000,000,000 fps you can see nuclear fusion, radioactive decay, and even light traveling (I don't understand hoe considering the photons are what's hitting the camera lens.. but I read it on the internet)
I'll bet they were terrified that the electricity would somehow damage their high-speed camera
How many FPS would be needed to capture light at 186,000 miles/s?
It's like a neural web that happens in the air simultaneously being accessed by the coil... This is why we are conductors, we are those connections, at the conception of life. We are compatible with the environment around us, inside us is that same system, organized perfectly to provide movement ability (circulatory & nervous systems). Alright, enough babbling from someone not in a science field xD
I've never seen Medhi talk to anyone but himself...  or stand up...
Just use multiple phatoms with a mirror set-up. Electroboom can probably figure out the best rotational speed.
:)
Electrons proving rather too spritely for a lowly 1.75 megaframes/sec...  Perhaps an electromagnetic can crusher would be a good subject next?
💚💚
Newton's cradle but with fuses.
A simple Arduino, or similar, circuit could log the time when events happen so you could find them in the video more easily.  Fun stuff!
OMG ITS ELECTROBOOM!!!
thse 3 guys can solve time travel watch
you should try a collab with the hydraulic press channel.
3 coolest people in the world dooing coolest stuff in the world, best video on You Tube!!!
I wasn’t ready for this crossover 😂
You mean 50 fps.
I'd love to see the Mogar family in Slow Mo
Excellent visualisation of frequency. Seeing this I think a good idea would be to capture in slow motion a start of a metal halide lamp. In short MH lamps are discharge lamps where there is a sealed arctube filled with noble gas, mercury and salts of metals, when lamp is cold the salts are deposited on the arctube. Initially an external ignitor strikes an arc between electrodes and at first only noble gas is ionised, the arc heats up mercury which then evaporates and is ionised, after that sequentially the arc goes even higher in temperature which makes metal salts evaporate too and be ionised. Thing is that with such progression the arc changes color as each next ionised element contributes to the spectrum. Sometimes in certain metal halide lamps a larger chunk of deposited salt gravitationally comes into the arc which causes fast evaporation which can be seen as a flash of certain color, like pink flash. I think such flash would look awesome when captured in slow motion. When turning on a cold lamp, sometimes emissive coating from electrodes goes ejected and ionised, resulting in another type of flash. Also such lamps when powered from 50Hz mains supply flash hundred times per second so would be interesting if pink flashes during salt evaporation are is in sync with main arc frequency.
Sparks rise up because of 1920's Hollywood frankenstien. Thumbs up to Medhi, circuit breakers .Insane fps, need an filter to search the images, python. you could just read brightness one small area of each frame and sum
9:42 totally reminds me of when Harry and Voldemort fight! (Dan... Radcliffe?!)
12:45 true schadenfreude of dan n gav right there lmao
I studied electrical engineering with specialization in high voltage and this video really gave me flashbacks to all the lectures regarding the topic haha  Nothing really surprised me, but it’s very nice to see those effects I’ve learned about actually happen.
Shoot Lego huge sets with air rifles and real guns!! That would look so cool
ElectroBOOM is the original mad scientist,, borb 150 years too late, #frankenstien
THE COLLAB OF LEGEND, IT'S FINALLY HAPPENING
If you increase the frequency to 1GHz, V'Ger will begin to take form.
how doet it look like when you try to find the right moment of the recorded footage? do you scroll through images? how long did it take you to find the right moment in all that footage ?
Some things that blew my mind about this video: 1: It seems like the "popping" sound that happens is pretty close to the timing of the electrical "fluff" closing into 1 arc.  2: The idea that you slowed seconds into hours was really fun to think about.
At 17:04 the arcs towards end fade out before the arcs at the front. If the load is the same across all of them, does this mean that arcs actually form at the back first? Or do they just experience less charge and therefore dissipate before the front? Just curious.
Electricity is Godly!
Try steel ball in hydraulic press
I need a compilation of Dan getting tortured… Asking for a friend
In order to create electric arc effects for Star Trek the Motion Picture, the effects team worked with an enormous tesla coil in a warehouse... but they had to move a few times because it was so powerful it started to cause disruptions along the LAX flight path. I can totally see why!
1,750,000 frames per second  captured more than I thought it would considering that light travels at around 900,000,000 fps [feet/sec]
Good video. The reason why the furthest node activates first is because marx generators charge all the capacitors first. The spark gap connects the circuit. So the furthest node is the one needed to connect the circuit and thus sparks first. Note: I am tired atm so I am not 100% sure my theory is correct. If I'm wrong ask Distinti, they can probably solve this.
isnt there motion detection software to help sort through the megaframes?
9:19 YouTube: Challenge accepted.
u guys became antisocial? xD
Will be so amazing to see a Phantom camera after 30-40 years. Even if the slow mo channel is gone they have to come back for one video with breaking glass or electrical arcs. Will be amazing to see this with a much much faster camera on a much bigger resolution too.
This will be the PC performance in 2013
the tension on the last one is higher while the current is higher in the first one, mby due the the phase changes thru the capacitors which are in serie
The most brilliant thing is that they are still learning new things!
Very cool, thanks guys.

brilliant video, but does anyone know what causes this red glow???  https://youtu.be/vaLh78WIH14
I love it good job guys.❤
Upload it with lofi background music
Would the arc path be a straight line without fingers in a Vacuum?
Feel like the arc following the same path and turning off an on and still following the same channel is sorta like lighting a blown out candle from the smoke
After all this time, the poor guy looking for his friend Gav in RDR2 - he's been on Youtube all this time! :P
Slo Mo Guys,  https://youtu.be/vaLh78WIH14  You know what to do…
When will you get a 5M fps?
Amazing content ☺️
This colab was fun
They follow the same path as the previous spark, bcuz the air is already ionised by the previous spark. Therefore new spark will tend to travel in higher conductive path.
That was cool.
Now I am even more convinced that Medhi's 'accidents' (he electrocutes himself all the time) are for real and not just well played bits on his own channel. I fear for his safety!
Crushing ball bearings with a hydrolic press! Search it up. Would be AMAZING in slow mo!
11:36 The camera and the what?
Interesting conundrum... trying to film something moving at the speed of electricity/electrons using an electrical device (Phantom) that relies on sending electrical signals and data at that very same speed ... could a quarts crystal ever oscillate fast enough to drive a circuit to capture the movement of electricity.... kinda like asking if a creation ever outdo its creator?
GUYS WE ARE 9 DISLIKES AWAY FRIM 420 PLEASE DO 420 DISLIKES
why they sparks 2D dimension not 3D?
Do you think it would be possible to put that Pink Panther theme tesla coil as a short?
6:49 I remember Mehdi speaking this calmly in his first videos. The one with the "electric guitar" for example lol
1:57 🤣
I think spark gaps can switch in 20-30ns.  I expect you could see this on an oscilloscope with the probe laying near by.  So I'd expect one switch to fire, then the rest to chain fire after that.  Still be over in 200-300ns...
This is the video I didn't expect but I would have if I was told Mehdi was gonna blow up stuff with the guys
WOOOO ELECTROBOOM!
This is gold.
I've finally found Gavin, my old friend
Try this but use two electrodes and submerse the electrodes in an electrolyte. You won’t regret it. Guarantee another free 1 million views in 3 days
This seems like a good experiment to at least shed some more light to the "how fast does electricity travel through a wire" debate thst happened earlier this year.
This video has how many thousand likes, 69. 😏
Wintertime in the midwest taught me the screwdriver trick. Every doorknob is a potential shocker so i walk around with a small screwdriver to release the voltage i saved up walking around.
cool
This video Hertz.
Awesomeness  Excellent job.  Thanks for your efforts.
The power current flows from - to + . That would be the reason for the suspected direction of sparkling being the end first. The first jump may have been to quick to film??
so it's like a bfs algorithm in the simulation we live in. cool
Care to get TwoMad to touch this?
we need more of him in your show
MEHDIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!!
Didn't know that Kasparov likes teslas
17:15 -  The large gap seems to show 'Baileys beads' as the arc subsides, similar to a lightning-strike.
The obvious question is, can we make a gun that shoots a stream of ions or something so that the tesla coil mounted on the business end will have a very predictable and very straight arc straight ahead so we can have the directional lightning gun finally?
Maybe with 10 camera`s triggered by a 20Mhz decade counter you could do 17.500.000 FPS in Go-arround action. :) Maybe you can beat the speed of light(not)
Alpha Phoenix has a couple videos studying the speed of electricity. They're pretty good. They shed some light on how fast electrons move, and its nearly at the speed of light.
ElectroBoom needs to make a much longer chain so they delay between the first and last is far greater
4:27 there is a reason rubber tires in your car will not stop lighting hitting your car.  Do you think that a few inches of rubber will stop a lightning bolt that has travelled through miles of air. The voltage is so high that it will jump across a large gap to reach the ground.
Out of curiosity, could you daisy chain several of these cameras (if you magically had them), and then offset each one's start time in order to see the frames in between the frames?
Brilliant!  My favourite three nutters in one room with some amazing shots.  Thanks.
Oh hi there @ElectroBOOM
Oh hi there @ElectroBOOM
I would like to see if you guys can get or take a shot of the moon such that you try to see if you can record it such that you can make it seem clear that it's moving or some other such, as in catch the moon moving not the Earth Rotation or both or some such and show the difference in how it appears.
Awesome!
one day they will slo mo the light with trillions of fps and 0,001 seconds will be 500 TB
Cool
Two Brits and a Canadian.  So does that make you three a BBC?
I wonder what it would look like passing a spark through oil?  The gap would have to be smaller than air but would it be slower?
Bro turned this into a science lesson
If only you could have gotten a non-earthed platform to hold an Iron nail in place and see what the electricity does then... If you used magnets for example i'm sure it would create magnificient results!  p.s. the entire thing mit explode or at a certain voltage you could possibly see the magnetic-eletric field in action. Do more, DO MORE!
My only real complaint of this video was the subject matter of the shot was constantly overlayed on Mehdi's crotch. At this time its been 1.1 million people staring fixedly at a crotch close up watching the action!🤣
If the arc of electricity is 2.78E7m/s crossing 5 lengths of wire of 1/36th of a meter then to see half the arcs switching on you would need a camera taking a frame in 4.996 nanoseconds, if each frame is 1/1750000 = 571.4 nanoseconds then you would need a camera 114.377 times faster!  If you wanted to se each one fire individually you would need a frame in .999 nanoseconds which is 571.89 times faster!  I'm not sure if discharging electrons (such as a lightning strike) go at this speed or not, I've heard it is one third the speed of light which would result in needing a frame in 1.389 nanoseconds, then you would need a camera 411.429 times faster! To see each turn on then requires a frame in .278 nanoseconds which is 2057.14 times faster!!  My math could be wrong but the idea of needing speeds this fast just to see something we're witnessing every day when the lights turn on is so cool!
Best collab you've ever done.   Electricity in slow mo is so amazing.
the collab we all needed but didn't know we needed
YEA I NEEDED THIS LETS GO
This was SO GOOD.
This was absolutely great. Well done Slow Mo Guys and ElectroBOOM
the perfect Collab doesn't exis...
The diode at the end sparked first because the true path of current is neg to pos not pos to neg. Great that the camera can show that
y’all have great on screen chemistry
My two favourite chaos lords doing a collab... don't wake me up
A collab I've wanted for ages. It's always a fun time when Mehdi comes over. I wonder if there is a simple program you could write/get that can do the video skimming for you. Given the enormous brightness difference between active and inactive frames, surely an algorythym can compare them and assemble just the active frames to save you hours of skimming when dealing with these frame speeds. Or at least tag the centre point.
When Dan held the screwdriver to the Tesla coil while holding the screwdriver and didn't feel a thing (at first), I was reminded of a trick I do when I want to discharge static but not want to feel it: hold a metal key and touch something conductive. It'll discharge static from you and you won't feel a thing.
Why 1,750k ?  You guys did 5M before ?!
🤗⚡️🎥📹📸🎞
So was the slight glow in the last capacitor functioning the same as the lead for a lightning strike? And the flash is the return stroke?
bro who dislikes videos
re: Your open air Marx generator; you would need a "light speed" camera to capture the propagation of the arcs as one of the trigger mechanisms for the following arcs is the UV light emitted by whichever one breaks down first.  This has been proven/done in the past to synchronize HV arcs by holding the Marx at slightly below its spontaneous firing voltage and then introducing an external UV flash (e.g. external flash or arc) to trigger the Marx.
This was awesomely funny but fantasticly interesting.....great job to both channels!!!⚡⚡⚡
Very disappointing.  Less talking.  More action.  You wasted 75% of the video talking.  Seriously.  This should have just been a 5 minute video and it would have been wwwaaaaayyy more exciting.
Way cool experiment. Now the obvious next would be how the arc behaves amidst various gasses, pressures or vacuum.
It looks like miniature lightning. Mesmerizing
Mehdi drew me in.
This is the greatest collaboration. These two channels have deserved each other for far too long.
I can't think of something more terrifying than to stand next to Medhi while he works on one of his machinations :V
I love electroboom, such a wholesome modern day tesla
16:53 this shot right there is what makes the world tick, just look at the happiness and anticipation in their faces. :D
Ionisation is what is breaking down the resistance of the air.
I think this has to be my most favorite collaboration. Keep the colab going
I LOVED his electric guitar!!!!
This was awesome
Hey you found the guy who busts his load to getting shocked
Don't worry Dan, after watching this video and hearing you say out loud "hot air goes up", I immediately went to take my pizza out the oven and shoved my face into the 400 degree air coming out.
Please do a bit with veritasium about electricity
Maybe if you get a new lab coat it'll protect you or look better.
Is it purple due to the air ionising or is it something else?
Do slow mo of a water jet spinning skateboard / roller skate wheels!!!!
Great collab. You're an awesome team
Great video, thank you guys and Mehdi :)
2 of my favorite channels doing a collab??? Happy birthday to me!
Didn't know how much I needed this collab
Curious of his reaction time from the time he got zapped to when he jumps away.
"You know what they say about frequency, you must sample at twice..."  You know what they say about the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem?
Greatest Collab Of All Time!
The crossover everyone needed.
11:36 sounded like he said something else
😀😀😁😁😍😍👍👍24/7 customer support
At 1 KHz, it really hurtz
Look at Mehdi’s at 18:10 until you see him realizing he might never see the electricity move from left to right
Mehdi in his element. Nice to see him inflicting pain on someone else for a change!
What's 180 shutter angle to 1.75M fps?!!?!! I'm seriously asking
You should film a power arc at a HV power test and see if it goes dark as quickly. I would think that the air has afterglow, when there have been kiloamps going through the arc.
i think it ionizating the air...
Fascinating stuff guys. Thank you.
can you get multiple cameras and sink them together to increase you fps?
Mr physics teacher used to put electro boom on thr TV 5 minutes before the end of the lesson so we could all die laughing
Is the last gap a little smaller on the Marx(?) Generator? Would that explain it sparking early?
Dan, if you need to learn that hot air rises, just let one rip hahaha... (if hot air dropped or didn't rise, you wouldn't smell it as much now, would you? Or at least not any sooner than the people around you...)
Love electroboom
3 nerds enter a warehouse with a camera on a tripod... and they all have a smile on their face
This is one collaboration I never knew I wanted.
You guys often really go beyond the simple paradigm of the YT channel. You are well within the territory of scientific research, in my humble opinion. You are amazing.
You want to tell me that you filmed this at 171parts of a speed of light W O W.
I wonder what it would look like if it was Direct Current instead of Alternating Current
Of course the first thing Mehdi does is spark something lol
The reason the last gap always fires first, my guess is, the last gap happens to be the shortest.
the slow mo guys: let's spend a lot of money to record stuff at incredible speed me: watches at 2x speed
19:10 to be fair to Dan, I have a Masters in Physics and I didn't know arcs travel upwards (eg a Jacobs ladder) due to hot air rising.
That mix is gonna be dangerous :D
i love electroboom
Go to 14:21 for astonishingly applied slow-mo marvels.
I would love a video of Gav, Dan videoing something horrifying Mehdi and Styropyro made.
I follow both channels since long ago. I'm very grateful for this collaboration. It has rendered amazing results, in many aspects.
One of the best YouTube collabs I've ever seen. Thx guys!
Haha :_D best nerd team up on youtube!
Reminds me of Harry Potter in the graveyard scene in the 4th movie
He got the old shocker
8:40 Sounds familiar
I put the video even slower. To... 1/4 = 0.25 speed ! But even then electric arc is still too fast !
Is glass breaking faster?
11:36 with captions. Yes, YouTube heard it too.
What is this, a crossover episode!?
At 1:57 it sounds like a bit of GBA bowsers castle from mariokart super circuit (and wii)
LEGENDARY!!!!
What would arc do if you spray salty water on the area in between. Would it create straighter arc lines?
Nikola tesla could imagine these things when he used to close his eyes♥️a genius
Awesome collab. 😁
Its fascinating to see that it takes 4hrs for that to charge up at this speed, yet the arc was faster. Just think what would an electron experience, all the math we do everythingt o predict "fast" things, electrons have so much time to feel the effecttt
I am thinking this for a quiet while that is what if u disturb a shock wave by throwing a dart at it at the correct time what do u think about this@TheSlowMoGuys
Thank you for the video <3
Electroboom's video shows how much can go wrong in electronics and how it can happen to a genius like him too
Does the arc in the marx generator 'travel' to the other side, or does it just ionize the air between them and is there no time difference between the top and the bottom of the arc? If it is the former, the arc is travelling at least 40km/s assuming the distance is 2cm
I wonder, I believe that multiverse kind of theory exists so… there’s a place where they’re named SloMoBros
how boring
Mehdi explaining Dan sounds like an asian/middle eastern dad listing you the punishments you're gonna receive
17:10 or the electric current charges the whole device then POPs when it reaches a discharged level 🤔 It's just faster than we think
Mehdi makes a fool of himself on his channel so much, we forget how knowledgeable he is.
YES! I have been waiting for this !
why wont macro shoot the electricity?
Brilliant Video, so refreshing to see you all together, good luck on the next one :)
Too many too long too violent ads... Gave up.
amazing collab!!! THANKSS
It's crazy to think that at 1.75mil. FPS light only travels 171 meters between the frames
So awesome video👌
@veratasium cool
The power creep on this channel is getting out of hand.
That sound 4:26, I hate my mind😐
Only just seen that they have a tv show on Sky/NowTv in the uk called Slo Mo Guys Big Adventures! Why havent I heard about this before?
Ofcourse it need explode first:):) 5-6 Sec action,so we recording 2.630 Minits...(43.8 Hours!)
14:04 I think they were talking about the wispy bits around the right end but what I can't stop looking at is what I can only describe as a corona covering the entire upper right half of the frame all leading back to the bare leads. You can even see them arcing back to the beginning of the 3rd, 4th, & 5th resistors from the left
5:26 he briefly turned into a Sith Lord
put glitter falling on it and then see
5:25 LMAOO this looked nuts
I wanna see Dan shoot tracer rounds at that kinda speed…and maybe with some long exposures mixed in🚀
Lmao. This is the collab that YouTube needed. Thank you.
So happy to finally see Mehdi on the channel, I remember this getting mentioned a while back and I am glad the video turned out so well. They all seemed to have a lot of fun recording this video as well, which just makes it that much better.
I swear Mehdi is on a quest to see how many Youtubers he can trick into getting shocked
EPICOLLAB!
Oh boy! The compression in this video done by YouTube is brutal 😂
What's weird is how fake the lightning looks.  Like it's *real*, but it *looks* fake sometimes. Weird.
Who else is watching at 0.25 playback speed?  And then frame-by-framing?
Watching the arcs in slow mo gave me the chills. The build up and discharging is so mesmerizing.
It's so cool to see Mehdi just chilling, talking normally, being a genius, and a goof.   What a mensch.
5:20 lmao
Perfect way of showing how corona and air ionization works!
This is amazing!!!!
Y'all had some serious chemistry. What a great collab!
Need to do a Jacob's ladder of some sort in slow mo.
I think the same or similar test in a vacuum would be interesting
For the normal speed footage, you probably should've used a 360° shutter (i.e. 1/50 s, with a neutral density filter if necessary) so that the arcs would actually be visible. As it was almost none of them were visible due to the short shutter speed.
Three legends :)
Madhi is the real deal, this is a great collaboration!
I like the videos on this channel, but this one really gave me the willies…three people with zero respect for electricity and the dangers it poses.
information.    mehdi said the behavior of the arcing is, in part, a result of AC  power.?!? but, this schematic  suggests  it's  DC.      (which is what i  ALWAYS  thought.) https://images.saymedia-content.com/.image/t_share/MTc2Mjk4MjE0NzM4NTAyODI5/are-tesla-coils-dangerous-can-tesla-coils-electrocute.png
Slow Mo Guys VS Pulstar Spark Plugs... 🤔
Now shoot a 9mm past the Tesla coil and see if you can catch the arc hitting the bullet
Medhi: Yes, 220 kHz. Electricity Verified. :)
GREAT COLLAB IDEA
7:04 Who else thought that was a willy?
I feel like at the end you needed something to block the light from the spark coming from the right side of the screen to get a better look, it gets over exposed.
They should meet StyroPyro they’d love him lol
The first Tesla coil experiment played the tune to the pink panther but the movie studio claimed the entire video so I had to cut it out. 😢
Genius collab, awesome results. Mehdi is such a legend
I put on this video and look away for just a few seconds.  I hear the sound of electricity sparking and frying something.  I look back at this video, totally unsurprised to see Mehdi.
Thumbs down for the fact of how many bloody adverts in your video.
I'm obviously no physicist, I feel like the electron finds the path first with low level energy(aka the clouds of lightning), and once a connection is made it sends all of the backed up potential energy, and first spark before anything is the energy reflecting back some electrons, in a way showing the way to travel and the spark is that energy reacting with travelling in opposing directions to the normal energy flow. Now to go watch the video to actually find out
Well how you wanna film faster than electricity when the camera also works with electricity? 😂
👍 für den Algorithmus
I think that the blinking that was observed with the tesla coil arc is due to it being an ac current.   The arc is brightest at peak current and goes dark when it passes through zero on its way to the inverse peak.  If you could change the output wave to a square wave, you might get a more distinctive on-off blink, rather than a fade in, fade out.
So This is how ISOs created
They defently need even faster camera's for lightning. Its so fast
1:43 - 2:00 only OGs saw this Tesla coil scene in full before it was edited out 😔
This is also a channel https://youtu.be/2qJPUM4XaGA your should collaborate with.
Number 45 on Trending, 2 days later! :o
The colab we didn’t know we needed but now cant live without
it looks like osama this electric is going to blow i'll give you alalalalala
you couldve show tesla coil in action at 1.75
I know this would break things in physics. But... what if the reason the last one seems to light up first is that the arc is moving FTL for that fraction of a second giving it the appearance that it started from the endpoint. A more reasonable explanation is that there is a built-up electric field around the device before it goes off and the arc once started connects at any point in the field across to the rest, but the speed is so high that for all intents and purposes it seems instant. Just some ramblings from someone who doesn't know much about how electricity works.
Its crazy to think that wild plasma is what powers the modern world
One thing I've been wanting to see for a long time is a macro shot of an HID bulb arc. It uses a roughly 20kv initial arc then levels out to 12v. And I think the way it kinda flickers for a split second would look pretty cool in slow mo
A thought... daft punk never made a song with tesla coil sounds....
i wonder how bad it is for your eyes to see electricity.. in slowmo.
Can u ask dan to rob a bank or something? He does whatever by this point
So it finally happened :)
@ElectroBOOM 15:53 my guess as to why the last one is turning on first: assuming the circuit as a waveguide in which there is a mirror in the end; the last capacitor is the first one in which the incident and reflection electromagnetic field is adding up together doubling the wave amplitude in the last capacitor first!
It was Hydraulic Press Channel / Beyond The Press who did the "Chronos Ring"? Am i remembering this right?  Just do that with like 20 of your 1.7mil fps cameras to get higher frame rate. ;P
12:49  Power supply: "Wzzebwwm!" ElectroBOOM: "Oops... [...] Did I break that?"
In other news, hot air raises😆😆
even nasa computers do almost 2 million FPS hahahaha
Electricity on s=peed of light VS high speed camera... XD i am not dissapointed XD
Lmfao test subject Dan! I mentioned on Electobooms Video, of you guys recording ElectroBOOM, and styropyro all in one video!
Great video!
When i see arcs i think of electroboom
It's funny seeing Mehdi being a little awkward but still having fun :) I hope he was able to fix his power supply later.
Idea for a new Slow-Mo video  Fill a big balloon with water and tie it. Now throw sone small water balloons at the big balloon and show us the slowmotion of the waves from that balloon.
Imagine a slowmo camera taking speed of light frames. 😮
WE’RE GONNA NEED A BIGGER FPS
This is the best collab ever dude, I never thought I'd see these two unique worlds collide
So funny to hear them say "We are starting at 100k" after all of these years of watching them.
So happy about this collaboration! ElectroBOOM!!!
Did you guys really spend 30 minutes looking for the last shot or do you have a tool to help you look for frames that differ a lot from surrounding frames? If not that sounds like it would be a fun challenge to write something to do that for you.
We've seen 36 hour videos on YouTube now.  Upload that arc!  :D
Wow, watching my hives inflammation fade day after day until they completely vanished was such a relief, I went with what I pointed out and within the first 10 days or so the urticaria/angioedema was barely visible! I just go'ogled the latest by Shane Zormander and after 20 days my skin has never been healthier!
Amazing video guys.
Pause, period repeatedly to watch Dan and Mehdi getting electrocuted frame-by-frame
This is awesome
8:24 On and off. Is that the secondary ringing? The primary spark gap frequency is much lower, bam, wait a bit, secondary output, primary resting, waves moving back and forth in the secondary continuing some output on each cycle, and eventually another primary bam
A dream has come true. 👍🏻
Should have called it  " Fist bump with lightning" ❤️
The video just started and I'm already hitting the thumbs up button 👍
Whenever one of you are really sick, you should shine a light in your nose and slow-mo the exit of gunk from your nose 🤣🤣🤣!
i need the slow mo of medhi's smile as he increases the frequency
You should film a mercury-arch rectifier! ⚡️⚡️
great mix of my two favorite channels
There's always something faster, regardless the framerate 🤯 What a great video, I'll rewatch this several times the coming year(s)...
What would we see if this was in bullet time at a million Frames?😳
Dan faces are like: wait I didn’t sign in to be Thor 😰⚡️
Gavin mimicking the rising arcs and making the sounds at 2:42 cracks me up. Really gives off "kids doing a cool science experiment" vibes haha.
Im here because ElectroBOOM 💪
As someone who regularly electrocutes himself, it must be entirely entertaining to be shocking someone ELSE for once!  xD
The "fluff" at 5:55 is quite cool. The resonance shot is at 10:10 - it manages to cool off enough in that time between pulse peaks to show up blinking and it shows up for both peaks within a period. CPU cache operational delays are measured in nanoseconds (billionth, 10^-9) and a clock cycle on a CPU is 1/3 to 1/6 a nanosecond nowadays, reliable on/off switching between the transistors , the gates they form and the operations those form. Quite nuts.
Lol this guy just said "two megaframes".
brilliant collaboration!
Hey Gav, Dan, had a question; You said 70,000 times slower than real life, the video is uploaded at 1080p50 so are you just stretching 25fps raw footage to 50fps? I.e one frame of raw footage is shown over two frames on YouTube? Thanks, love the vids.
Nice collab, would love to see more of such
1 mil + FPS breaks my brain
I wish I could have put two likes. One for you guys and one for Mehdi. :)
Imagin playng Fortnite in 1,750,000 fps
Medhi is a gem. Glad you guys had fun. :)
17:27 It looks like, not only does the lowest resistance point start the cycle, but it looks like a faint arc finds it's way back to that first gap on the wand. Over the top of the output arc.
Lol this takes me back to the older Mehdi videos of him always getting shocked
Medhi: "let me increase the power a little bit..." Dan: **concerned stare**
Gav and Mehdi seem like they could be such bros and I ship it
The reason they all "go" at the same time is because you're creating a magnetic feild which does change at the speed of light.  You cannot film faster than the electric field change.
Awesome....!! Poor human guinea pig Dan...!!! Now we only need a 100.000.000 FPS camera recorder, right guys????
Medhi!!!!
"5 hours earlier" to "present day"
9:42 I think ElectroBOOM invented the Tesla coil censor beep, LMAO 🤣!
If there is no magic pops and smoke it’s a fake electroboom.
Repent for the kingdom of GOD is at hand, WARNING, repent and be baptized with the holy spirit, ask for forgiveness now he is soon to come
We need a slo-mo of his unibrow caterpillaring. At 1M fps. lol Let the memes begin! (I know, I know, it was just fun to request.)
826,512 views, 55k likes, 1.8k comments, 14.5M subscribers, #20 On Trending. Nice!!
Ok so it appears we need to delete the air in this situation. We need a vacuumed chamber
GOOOOOOOOOOOOD ! SO GOOD !!
It would be awesome if they could revisit rockets, specifically close up of rocket motors with this camera. Something above your standard hobbyist grade stuff.
Can you get a vid of a waterjet cutting stuff?
Hi guys happy Halloween🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃
5:25
Nice to see Mehdi in his real world form (i.e. a little shy and giggily). But awesome to see two of my favourite channels combine forces.
I assume the last piece is a little bit closer to each other than the rest and that’s why the arc is jumping earlier than the others.
Is it just me, or is Mehdi _basically_ just a Warhammer 40k Ork with electronics?
These two videos can help if you're going through a hard time :-)  https://youtu.be/vXg9wWIN-Xo  https://youtu.be/3n-DOKBffuU
Time for you guys to visit the mechanics of baseball, with all the spin that MLB pitchers put on balls, what happens to the rotational inertia on impact with a bat
As I understand it, what we're actually seeing is the release of energy that accompanies the ionised gas recombining with electrons from the atmosphere. When the ionised gas molecule regains a previously removed electron, the energy that was required to ionise that molecule is released and seen as light. So the light from an electric arc isn't so much about seeing the ionised trail of the path of the electricity, but that we're instead seeing this path as it de-ionises.
You guys: What frame rate should we do next? Mehdi: [Having seen that the technology works in testing] “Full power.”  Mehdi: [connects electric lead] Marks generator: [sparks with extreme power in front of an extremely powerful camera setup] Mehdi: 😄😁😄😁  What can you say? 🤗
place a fan near the tip and see how that affects the branching patterns
Sick colab!
Guys, you should collab with StyroPyro and see what sort of stuff he could get.
This video doesn’t go any louder than any video on you tube. In fact every single video on you tube is equally loud, even the grass growing world championship channel.
Crazy vid as always 🔥🙏🏽😂😳
Hi guys, do you believe it would be a good idea to find out a way to "shoot" a needle to a window pane so fast that it would break it ?
Go to titans of cnc
Two channels I love in one film... what else could I wish! Oh, well I also like this mixture of enthusiasm and fear on Dan's face :D
free electrons move at a speed of 3 million km/h ? 🤔🤭
I trust that no Dans were harmed during the making of this video?
there you go
Amazing
Awesome video ^^
16:28 They should add a feature where you set a mask in the screen where you want to detect a movement, a difference in color, etc to stop and/or make some keyframes, so you can "jump" to that part of the footage and check them quickly, like choosing chapters in a movie...🤔
You know what would be cool? Seeing a phantom's shutter... filmed by another Phantom at 1.75mfps
12:40 ElectricBoom makes a joke about vain Instagram people, that isn't appreciated to its fullest.
6:04 can you try to make the air follow one direction using a fan and see how the spark shapes?
Question: Do you think electrical arcs are faster than glass breaking?
Can you network several of those cameras and offset the frame start to effectively double, triple, or better the frame rate?  That is, start camera A, then camera B a quarter frame later, camera C half a frame after A, them camera D at 3/4 frame before camera A opens its shutter again to start its frame 2.
God’s creation is amazing and just shows how sovereign and mighty He is❤
Dan you’re not alone on that discovery🤯🤯
Hey I was wondering, I haven't watched much of your videos, but I can see it's a problem looking for the frames where a spark happens. I don't know how you exactly go about it, but isn't it possible to film the setup and the high framerate camera with a seperate camera, and then you can see how much time it takes from when the camera starts recording and when the sparks start going?
There are papers that show the initial arc creation of a capacitive discharge circuit can have peak currents 1000's of times higher than the average discharge current.  This peak occurs on a time scale of 1 to 10 ns.  Crazy stuff.
how is this Mehdi still alive?.. shocking! 😉😂
was watching electroboom and saw the shutter speed of his camera fail to capture arcs in their entirety, so I wondered if maybe the slo mo guys have done something like that, only to find this video that is only 1 day old and has electroboom in it lol
mehdi should have a goal of shocking (safely) the biggest youtubers lmao
This is cool.  20 years ago, we were collecting secondary ignition voltage for analyzing spark plug performance at MINIMUM 2Ms/s.  It's really impressive to see VIDEO recording has now caught up to the sampling speeds needed.
Awesome collab. These three guys are awesome!
What is the song from that the Tesla coil is playing in the first slow mo?
Jokes on you guys, I knew who you were, but was not subbed yet, so now I subbed.
At 7:27 I thought he said: "We'll see what expletive we can see..."
@11:30 if you divide 430Hz by the square root of 3 you get 248.26Hz.
"there! Did you see it?" "are you serious?" "no"  Medhi is such a troll, i love it
Great video.
I wonder if we take 2 high speed cameras and sync them such that the 2nd camera starts recording when the first camera has recorded just the first frame, would we be able to double the framerate by combining the shots of the cameras? 🤔
the crossover we needed xd
Just FYI, also probably allot do mention it in the comments, they do not trigger at the same time but very fast in those small Marx probably within 100 ns. Bigger generators used for testing HV equipment are slower, but still <500nS you can see it in the output voltage often. But yes, you would need an even Faster camera. Also, an interesting fact, the UV from the first gap that ignites causes also breakdown to happen in the other ones. That's why the Gaps in a big generator have to "see" each other, also the construction of the generator forces additional breakdown to happen, maybe you can get access to a HV lab and maybe someday do it on a big one. I'm unfortunately in Germany, where i you get you access to such a big lab with a 1MV Generator.
That's really important scientific data! Dudes u guys did something really great.
What if you are subscribed to both
Schlieren photography would show the air convection from the arcs. Also - photographing in UV might show some additional information because the air emits UV when it begins to ionize. Excellent videos however!
What a great video guys!
Hello good to see you .
What a great collab! Pain^2 in slow motion
In this video: Dan doing his impression of Thor lighting the forge at Nidavellir.
It's so cool watching electricity hurt us at slow speeds!
Came for the laughs,  stayed for the SCIENCE!!!  What a great bit of research, er, entertainment.
"Were you feeling it?" LMAO
So If I understand the contraption properly the reason it starts at the end is because the voltage has to rise high enough in that area to over come the air gap and as soon as it does all that electricity suddenly has some where to go initiating all the others at the same time
Can you do speakers with the Phantom
This is GREAT! Mehdi is a LEGEND SO funny haha great COLAB!
Awesomeness!
Great collaboration from a few of YouTube’s very best creators. Thanks gentlemen.
Fascinating!
What if you mad ethe circuit longer, therefore creating a longer delay
Best COMBOO
How many FPS can you record a moving object at 299,792,458 meters/second?
When you learn by touch, electrician must be a hard choice of career..
Mehdi is so awkward with these guys and it's wonderful. What a fantastic video!
Love from electroboom
Mehdi is such a naturally funny guy. Love his attitude!
I wouldn't trust him :) Interesting that the ladder goes almost simultaneously. It's 600ns frames yet they never showed any progression, suggesting it's significantly faster than 600ns which brings it close to the speed of light. It's actually strange because inductance is in play for the current to ramp up so for that to go to full brightness within a frame, that's a bit surprising. I guess it's a single 1cm wire loaded with around 10kV.  formula says 10kV/6nH is a ramp up of 1.7trillion amps per second so I guess that's pretty fast. Or 1million amps per frame so...   it's fast.
- Can you not trust this face? - Ye, i trust you, i trust you. - Muahahah  😁
That's if someone is slapping your 1000 times a second <c> 😂
Top 3 most epic crossover in the history of anime
Clearly time for you guys to make a series of rapatronic cameras in a series to make an even slower capture.
This was a very good video!!
15:14 that laugh 😂
We want for the next collaboration with electro boom, Medhi's eyebrow movement in slow motion
I never knew it is as if the ions make a little tunnel in the air and then it just uses that for as long as it exist. This was in a word EPIC
1.21 giggawatts
im not even halfway through but .....poor dan
the collab i needed today
You know I always thought electroboom was faking 100% of his mishaps. But then he said oh yea I gotta divide by 2. Now I'm not so sure.
I have been waiting for this day
what an epic collab!!😍😁😁👍👍 the  event, which brings whole youtube together 😁😁 .. aand quite frankly, i didn't expect Mehdi to actually shock himself or blow up something in this vid, despite I know him for ages 😂😂 .. kinda surprised me 😂
4-5inches is indeed a large distance😅
ive been waiting for 7 months. this is great and i cant be happier
Why don't you guys do straight up light?
Mehndi and slo-mo guys both are my favourite
dont worry guys electroboom has cheated death many times
Instead of showing a headphones warning, couldn't you just lower, or audio-compress the loud peaks
but what about the FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER???
This is the most ambitious collab in YouTube history.
Great combination! I subscribe to both channels! 👍👍👍👍👍
It's amazing how silly and foolish Medhi is able to make himself look in his own videos (even his vid on this collab) but then you hear him explaining the science and engineering to these guys and you remember that this guy really is a trained professional
https://youtu.be/5wbKsfIOylw🏆👹
Based on this in a thunderstorm it should be highly likely that a lightning might strike at one place more than once?
Love the chemistry between you guys. Great vid!
What if the switch was longer, give more length to see a potential time difference?
https://youtu.be/vr_aWwmHleA
this video is already legendary
This what i was looking for
I have seen footage of a hand held tesla coil device that used a laser shot to ionize the air and make the tesla charge follow a path.
I love Dan being the Everyman in this video Its perfect
"let me increase the power a little bit..." Dan: 😨
Well, you can upload longer then 12 hours, looking at the Infinity Uno game of 39+ hours.
It looks like theres volts coming from the screwdriver before it actually meets and makes the bang.. weird
Hey, wanna see the same Tesla coil footage through more faster camera with Mehdi and you guys soon.....
These lightnings are cracks! Cracks in the air and filled with plasma! The behavior is the same as with the thunderbolt lightnings from the other video: as soon the lightning reaches a surface (either the Earth or Dan's hand) all the charge (plasma) flows through this path.
5:44 "Were you feeling it?" By brain auto-memed that to 'Are you feeling it *now* Mr. Dan?!'
Can database signal detection slow motion guys
Oh wow... didnt expecting slow mo with electroboom
Dan Gruchy... Best guineapig ever. 👍🤣🤣🤣      😎🇬🇧
WHAT IF, Medhi made say, a 5 metre, 10 metre long version of the MARX generator, WOULD WE see a difference from first to last discharges? 🤔😏     😎🇬🇧
Happy about this collab.
should be noted that they were playing with low amp electricity, making this experiment safe
Palpatine: "power, unlimited power!" 4:07
the crossover I would have never thought to ask for but am glad it has happened
The capacitor blowing up video was another great video from you guys! 👍 And it's great that you are still doing collabs 👍. Also, there wouldn't be a funny boom, if theres no Medi & Electroboom! Hahaha   😎🇬🇧
For next video, don't if its possible 4 u guys make it, but if possible, make an incandescent bulb filled with hydrogen gas and oxygen gas in the ratio 2:1 switch it on, also do it with its head submerged in water
That image of  Dan’s fist with the arc to it at the beginning needs to be a poster!
4:31 The best!
5:37 He must be very suprised. Because he looks really...shocked
Electroboom is a mega nerd. He gets weird in front of other people
16:55 we need a slo-mo of this 😂😂 I love how the reaction times come across
I think I see more plasma on the far left of the array at the end of the clip. You should make a longer array, which I suspect will amplify the signal you're attempting to capture (the speed of light).
Comment Leavers, Gavin was probably doing the Alpha Bet during this video
4:06 it was like a lil fist bump
Why doesn't it arc in a straight line? What is the path of least resistance altered by as it finds the arc path?
11:36  "It's A.C.  So, it's bright on... the negative peak and the positive peak."
Great collaboration. I love that you can feel a bit of genius weirdness between them.
I love this kind of stuff because it just shows both how far we have come with technology and science, but also how far there is still to go. There are something's we simply can't know yet because we don't have the tech for it
I wonder if actual scientific papers can be written based off of when you guys do stuff like this
omg the crossover of the century
Bruh that Pink Panther wibes at the beginning....  I cant beleive i still remember that show.
The spark hitting Dan's skin looks like bad CGI, reminding us all how the VFX industry is pushed to make things look *better* than reality
Dan’s lack of self-preservation is our gain.
@19:20 is why this stuff is incredible. great video
👍
Me who can watch it at 0.5x slower
I saw the video at 0.05x using a browser plugin, and I believe that there is a delay in the Marx Generator, the left one lights up, and then sequentially proceeds towards the right. The last capacitor reacts first, and here's my explanation:  *The electricity notices a gap in between the capacitors from left to right, so it progresses towards the last which also has an air gap, so it tries to jump and a connection forms b/w air with the other capacitor, then the arcs jump from one capacitor to the other from the left towards right.*  I know I've personified electricity and portrayed it as smart and able to find a path, but I hope you understand what I mean.
I don’t know if it’s been done before but I’m wondering what path the electricity would take in a vacuum.
28,61848 FPS slower slow moguy times
Electroboom defeats slow mo guys
I’m with you Dan! Knew hot air rises. Had never realised that that was the reason electricity arcs the way it does!!  Super cool to learn!
19:13 thru to 19:16 During the pulses of the arc, there's a pulse mid-arc that appears to have a different path to the pulses either side.  How?
Livestreams can be longer than 12 hours, you could stream it to the second channel and keep the recording online :D
the speed on that is just mind boggling. the same with glass shattering. just instant
1:49 Pink Panther Theme?
It's like the arc is testing for the path of least resistance, or like someone tapping in a nail before hitting in earnest
This is one of those collabs that youtube has been waiting for years. I can't wait for the break down analysis by Mehdi about the behavior of electric arcs from these filming days. I don't think this kind of research has been really done much at all even in the professional labs. Like I assume they'd be using different ways to measure, which aren't at all as visual and understandable. Talk about the benefits of scientifically oriented people and academics choosing youtube as their way of funding their projects and collaborating in areas where they personally lack skill and resources.  "You've known Mehdi for two days, are you at that level of trust" the answer is "He's still alive".
0:05 I love how he reacts :p
If you want to know why the spark gaps discharged at seemingly the same time, watch Eric Dollard's video on longitudinal electric propagation using capacitors.
Hey its that electrician guy
I had the biggest smile on my face watching this
The Marx generator spark timing is easy to understand (until we step back & think). We can build a greater & greater pd but no significant current is flowing. When a spark discharges the pd a (relatively) high current does flow. Easy - So: If All the sections of the spark gaps have the SAME IDENTICAL Z (impedance) Which isnt exactly possible,   then they will all spark at the same time due to the currents in the sparks being in phase / phase coherant. However:  if there is a mismatch in these impedances then the currents in the sparks must be "not synchronous" as viewed in "our-time frame. So the sparks photons must appear at different times to our time frame.
nice one!
Really happy to Mehdi here !
The best thing is by having medhi around you inevetably somehow end up with your average electroboom video.
Medhi is the most unprofessional professional, and I love it
Didn't expect a collaboration like this. I like it!
Nice and interesting video, thanks again cant wait for more!
I've known of Electroboom for years but never watched his content. Maybe I need to change that...
You should try it and record the sound that goes up like it does as the  power raises..  Would Dan be fooled?
Three kids playing with electricity in dad's garage 😆
As a Plasma Technology student, here are some thoughts on the video: 2:33 There might be two things at play here: As Medi mentioned, there is an ionized channel in the air and some of those ions/electrons might still be present by the time the next arc hits, reducing the required energy. There also exists something called metastables. A metastable is an excited atom/molecule that can't emit light (due to quantum mechanics). These metastables have quite a long life-time and are, because of their stored energy, easier to ionize. So the ionization energy of that channel decreases. These effects are then counteracted by convection (aka hot air rises), but it's a much much slower effect. 10:56 Yes, air can indeed blink that fast, even faster still. The lifetime of most excited states is in the range of a few to tens of nanoseconds. In plasma science, the most common frequency is 13.56 MHz, even there the light emission follows the shape of the voltage really closely. Optical spectroscopy is one of the most common diagnostics for us. 13:29 Here you can clearly see the effect of convection, which creates this nice arc shape 14:20 This is a really important detail here and it's really interesting for to actually see this. In atmospheric pressure electrical breakdown mainly happens via the so-called streamer mechanism. At these pressures, the electron density gets so big, that electric field that these electrons generate gets so big, the whole effect gets self-sustaining. A so-called streamer forms, which consists of a streamer head with a large number of electrons and a conductive streamer channel. Once the streamer hits the other electrode, there is a highly conductive channel between the two electrodes, essentially shorting the high voltage. This leads to these massive sparks. A streamer typically travels at the speed of a million meters per second. So assuming a 5 mm gap, that makes it 5ns to reach the other side. It is really remarkable that it's still visible here. 17:20 at a time resolution of less than 500ns you still can't really tell, if all of the gaps ignite at the same time or not. Electrical breakdowns can happen at much faster timescales. The scientific method to investigate this, would be to use a so called ICCD camera. These cameras can reach exposure times as low as 1ns. However, they can't shoot continuously. So you need a repeatable way to precisely trigger the discharge and then use a so-called delay generator to sync that to the camera. That way, by changing the delay between ignition and the shutter of the camera you can scan through the whole discharge at a much higher resolution  Thank you guys for this awesome and really interesting video!
17:43 God I love sarcasm
what about making the window even thinner to get a higher framerate? for the second test, you only really need one row of pixels to answer your question. (does the whole row ignite all at once, or does it travel along the line of pixels?)
The arc pathfinding is really cool to watch
Shout out to the auto-gen captions at 11:48
It was actually incredibly cool to hear individual 1Hz pulses turn into sound as Medhi increased the frequency
Try to capture laser beams
Dan's reactions are hilarious. :) "let me increase the power a little bit." the head whip is like "wait, what?"
would love to see this combined with femto-photography https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_9vd4HWlVA
Amazing
12:30 Yes, you can upload a video longer than 12 hours. I've seen videos over 20 hours long (GTA V 100% for example). As long as the video file is under 250GB, I think it should upload.
This was electrifying.  I'll see myself out.  For real: Loved watching Mehdi do a collab with you guys. Looks like you all had a wonderful time.  Cheers.
Was this before Uno Revenge?  That's more than 20 hours.
Don't know if it possible to get a full shot, but have you guys thought about filming a Jacobs ladder?
I love watching mad scientists at play... from THIS side of the monitor. XD
Συνεργαστηκατε με τον electroboom ? Άλλοιμόνο σας. Καηκατε. Θα γίνεται με κατσαρά μαλλιά. Δεν βλέπετε που αυτός δεν εχη μαλλιά ?
I've seen lightning blink like that! That's so cool! Now I'm wondering what frequency that lightning was hitting for me to be able to see it blink... crazy cool.
Just a thought... The spark gap that fires first is the most narrow gap, and the first gap that breaks down charges the rest of the matrix over the breakdown point, setting them off nearly simultaneously and creating the high voltage burst at the output.
This is the YouTube collaboration I’ve been waiting for🎉❤
The arcs all happen within light speed of one another, the electrons aren't traveling that fast but the EM fields that "tell them to arc" are.
Been watching electro boom for years and it’s crazy to see him on here. Amazing
I want more
Can anyone explain why the screen was behaving the way it did? I know Gav said “cause it’s capacitive” but what exactly does that mean and why would the electric arcs so far away be able to affect it?
The fact you guys still have it years from that one balloon video just mind blown 🤯
Can you set this camera up in a 360 ring?
DUDE I bet you could count on Corridor Digital to have the computing capability to edit  the 1.75mil frame shot! :o
Damm that was absolutely amazing I loved it that is so freaking cool I have never seen anything that cool by electricity it freaking was beautiful 2 b honest truly did love it tk U so much SMG 4 this epic epic video & yeah take care now amazing people bye peace out 😎😎😎✌✌✌💙🤍🖤💜⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡.
funny thing is even you know what would happen you guys still jump ^v^ 15:10
Have you guys ever done welding in slo mo should be pretty cool and def bright enough
ElectroBOOM ON ALL EPISODES!!!
This video is basically just using electricity to watch electricity 😀
ElectroBoom is a perfect fit for your vibe
Just subscribed🙌🙌, I've watched enough to know what I want in my life.
ElectroGOAT
Shoot a bullet next to it to see which is faster
That sound is so insane
Coolest Collab everrrr
электричество движется со скоростью света, вам нужна камера сверхсветовой скорости, которую ещё не изобрели, или изобрели))
remember, remember ...  https://youtu.be/2SuZeUckrts
Please do a video with lords of lightning. They have multiple large Tesla coils that people stand on top of wearing chain mail. Some are old school Tesla coils with a rotory spark primary generator and others are newer midi controlled ones similar to electroboom.  Each one uses 32a 3phase to run IIRC.
Couldn't you improve the resonant frequency measurement by counting several (all?) brightness peaks and then dividing by the total number of frames? If correct, it should even out any inconsistencies and get a closer result than just counting 4 frames.
Hey I got a good one for you guys like toilet paper on fire a big wad of it then blow it out and watch what it does it's like electricity through the toilet paper you'll have to do it to see what I mean
This is by far and away the most calm I've ever seen Medhi.
Timing is everything!
Mehdi AND Dan & Gav!?! We need more of this collaboration. Some of the all time best content creators, ever.
Such nice toys.    🙂
That is the best song in the world for a Tesla coil
this is amazing
I watched the Electro boom video about this video
Next upgrade to these slow mo cameraas should be thumbnails. In a folder. SO you can easily see where the stuff is you want to see.
Could be the start of a new series: how many things can we film at 1.7million fps which will look the same as through an ordinary camera?! Amazing experiment guys. Thanks.
Yes, I heard it, too. But Dan said "Tesla coil".
my money is on no arc until the complete circuit can actually allow current to flow so while the charge density of the preceding spark gaps will be charged and ready to fire the ground side flow wont accept electrons untill the circuit completes. so last spark gap acts as a switch to ground at the last step as the discharge function of the marx circuit is a series wiring arrangement. if you could see nearly at speeds of the level of the speed of light video there would be a noticeable cascade down the circuit, which really is pushing it as were talking fast enough to watch the answer to that veritasium "beef". also the parallel charge of a marx isnt perfect and likely fully charges the last stage last just due to the tiny increase in resistance compared to the other stages although i dont actually know off hand if that would be enough to cause the effect without needing full voltage to break down air and complete the circuit.  also dont see six am the other way up too often, grim doesn't even begin to touch what it does to your worldview.
so... stupid idea, could you maybe take a look at sparkplugs on a running engine, either with a see through cylinder head, or with just a plug not associated with a cylinder exposed for observation
Mehdi in a video? Instant like 😜
We did 4 people in a chain with a gas bulb on a tesla coil and the 4th person really got it
OMG this was definitely one of the best uploads! As an electronic geek, I was sooo blown away with all the info I learned.
This is the collab I never knew I needed.
Awesome coLABeration
ELECTROBOOM AND THE SLOMOGUYS OMG the legends all in one video. This must have been why there was an earthquake today. They're too powerful to be this close together!
The cascade starts where the electric field is greatest.  Electric field grows fastest for low RC, narrow gap, and small radius of curvature.  Component manufacturing and assembly tolerances will usually make one of the stages significantly quicker to fire; otherwise, two or even three will take random turns.  I think you should try to make an EMP generator from it.
because electricity does not technically flow in a circuit, so there is no order to when it is energizing things, aside from a circuit designed to do that with timers etc.
Its so nice to see a youtuber like Elctroboom showing love to the smaller channels
the collab i didn’t know i needed or wanted
if each successive link in the spark chain was weaker and you are trying to push through a current, would the last weakest one have more of a field charge around it causing it to spark first and triggering the rest as the current starts flowing faster until the field is depleted and the charge has to start building again?
Get an old style oil burner ignition transformer, or an old style neon sign transformer.  Film the arcs of those in slow mo.  They are a LOT hotter than the one from the Mars or Tesla coli.  That is what you use to make a Jacob's ladder, where the arc follows the hot air as it rises.  It follows the hot air because it is lower resistance., even though the path is longer.
I'm glad Mehdi didn't break the slomo cameras with his magic wand😂😂😂
ElectroBoom is one of the greatest YouTubers of all time, this was an incredible video!
THE FABLED COLLAB
14:37'  Discharge into counterspace? Or null point? At the arrow a spherical plasma cloud with a bright center,  Wow!
Have you guys ever thought of using pixel detection to find your frames of action?
that was awesome and i've been subscribed to you both for a long time ! great vid
"its almost like its running at the speed of light... almost" killed me
Wao
YES!
the collaboration i didnt know i needed
more medhi
Shoulda slowmoed the soldering as well!
It would be amazing to see an arc flash in slow mo
This is a collab that was unseen on so many levels. Absolutely amazing.
I've had the Pink Panther theme in my head all day and then this gets uploaded, life is a simulation.
I'd love to see sand blasting done super close and super slomo. I think it would be interesting to see different material sand blasted
This was a collab I did not anticipate.
Can you film a phantom with a phantom?
Mehdi does not believe in foreplay
Someone should do a compilation of every time they all laugh together.  ;)
The trilogy is complete.  Slowmo guys + linus Linus + electroboom Electroboom + slowmo guys
Avada Kedavra
That coil be making some sick bops
There’s a trick to uploading a vid longer than the limit and that’s if you stream the video live on YT and then save the VOD
The collab we didn't know we needed
We’re getting exciting close to being able to film light traveling. The frame rate they’re recording at has light tracking at around 170 meters per frame
"At the speed of science."
In Jr HS a friend and I messed with neon power supplies and learned that a Jacobs ladder wouldn't move if it was not oriented vertically.  The heat rising is what makes it rise and create the image of a ladder.  Learning has to be the greatest experience there is.  Thank you all for teaching us something new today.
Best youtube crossover 🥲
Ben Franklin would be delighted!
4:08 cool 5:36 cooler
Don’t turn subtitles on at 11:47 to read what Dan says😳
Did you know you can use a magnet to bend or move an arc ?     To solve a problem in the past I modified relays by adding a Neodymium magnet right next to the contacts to assist in 'blowing' out the arc created when the contacts open while conducting DC, especially from sources with high rise times, like solar panels.      Without this(and usually dc snubbers too) , the arc continues and your relay melts :)
Greatest collab they did ever
This is such an excellent collab.
This leaves me rather dumbfounded.  The more we observe and record the universe around us , the more incredible it becomes.  This in its simplicity is rather astounding in its values and behavior.   Ok , I'm going super nerd,  I'll see myself out.
There's a 12 hour length limit on YT videos?  Does that not apply to live stream recordings?  Because the Uno Infinite stream recording is 37.5 hours.
Do you realize, that if you set the camera up viewing a mile width in the pitch black, if you recorded a cars headlights  (bright ones) at 1,750,000FPS, you would record the speed of light over 9.4 frames?
Perhaps the reason they appear to light up all at the same time is because the little streamers that come before aren’t bright enough to be seen at such high fps?
Its funny how electricity usually behaves the opposite of what you naturally expect.
I'm quite curious about the file size of the 4 million frames
I'm surprised you didn't try a close-up of where the sparks initiate. It seems your most beautiful shots are always done in macro, and I think you didn't have so much lighting issues in this case
Hey could you guys do flash paper pls
I think if you check out AlphaPhoenix' video "I bought 1000 meters of wire to settle a physics debate", you might get an idea why the last one is firing first.
Q: in the Marx spark generator how precise are the gaps? Are they identical to a micron? Submicron? That might be why the right hand spark was early.
This video is very fun! Watching two of my favourite youtubers collab makes me very happy!
This is maybe the best collab ever.
Where is the FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER 😂
Wonderful team up!! And actually seeing the RF sinewave in the arc was totally worth the effort!
I wonder if The electrical signals in our bodies are just as fast.
Medhi looks so much different in 4K 60fps. Can we get @electroboom a new camera?
what the fudge even 1.7 million fps isnt enough for this 10 million in 10 years, see you then!
Yoooo I wanna see that unedited footage thoooo. I have always wanted to just, put on a completely raw video. Pleasseeeeeeee
Proudly wear my Forbidden Electric Guitar shirt as often as possible. Mehdi is one of the most entertaining YouTubers ever!
In reality, electrons always travel in the opposite direction of conventional electric diagrams. The transfer of electrons (current) is always opposite to how we visualize it. The electrons leave the negative pole of the circuit and travel to the positive pole. We just visualize it differently for convenience.
Great collab, tons of fun.
Legendary colab
very nice!
This is the most cientific episode, by far, in this channel jajaja
You guys should do fire works in slow motion, like the sparklers or fire crackers would be interesting
liked for eye brows, eye brows
This is the collaboration we've all been waiting for
could be that the gaps do try to arc at the same time but that the voltage jumps from 0 to maximum in a time greater than 0 so smaller gaps may arc first. Worth a thought
That's nuts you can actually see the AC current actually alternate between on and off. That's really something.
Medhi's laugh of excitement at 15:15 just radiates his passion on electricity!!
❤️❤️❤️
5:34 He was like Evil Scientist Mode Engaged
that was awesome!😁... wish you would have filmed a "Jacobs's Ladder" too😎...
That intro encapsulates Mehdi perfectly
YEEEEEEESSSSSSS. I love all 3 of you guys!! ELECTRO-BOOOOOOOM!
Lightning can leave ionized air nearly a half a mile wide I've seen it it's wild
Best.mashup.ever
Time to try it on the speed of light camera
YAY! I've wanted this collab for so long!
the crossover we didnt know we need.
How would a plasma arc look with the phantom!?!?
@6:05 that reminds me of slime mold branching out to find a path to food. wonder it its related some how?
Fantasitic! Also Gav, you need someone to develop an AI editor to sift through your video data
8:10 nyquist
8:49 its quite a distance as well - four five inches
18:30 Looks amazing.
poor Dan... 7:30 "can't see anytihng yet" but he feels it, he puts up with it anyway
the thingy with the electric jacks in a row, when the far right one, the lowest voltage and last in line, lit up first, then in the next frame all the others are lit up but the far right is noticabley smaller than most of them and the far left ones are huge. to me it says the one that lit up at first was the only one slow enough to register
YESSSSSSS ELECTROBOOM-SLOWMOGUYS CROSSOVER!!!! I have been dreaming of this for years. Now All I want to see is a chemistry YouTuber like NileRed or Syropyro on your channel.
I started as an electronics tech at the end of teaching tube/valve theory.  PC's on the horizon, smartphones unimaginable.  I thought then and seeing this video today...electricty is magic.  Thanks fellows.
Yeeeessss my youtube worlds are colliding in a mesmerizing array of torn lab coats, sparks and eyebrows!
YESSSSS FINALLY  IT HAPPENED
"Seems like it's running at the speed of light"   That's so obvious I feel stupid for not thinking about it
"Faster than we can manage" Slow Mo Guys
Dan just dueled that coil better than the final fight between Potter and Voldemort.
Now I'm here watching it at .25x speed to get a closer look.
I'm just here for Electroboom
Nice
If it works just like lightning bolts, negative lightning bolts have more of the rapid blinking, while positive bolts have a quick no multi flash bolt, while lighting obviously is really lethal, positive bolts are more lethal than negative bolts
This is really so cool and shows how impressive our harness on electricity is.
A Clab we didn’t know we needed
Megaframes per second is a new unit to me
The collaboration we never knew we wanted but actually needed.
Would the flashing of the arc at a higher frequencies be caused the higher frequency?
The UV light from the first ladder arc will trigger all the others very fast.
Why don't you have a slider, or a pendulum or something to give you a time reference as you sift through?
After the water bottle + hammer demo. I wonder if the same phenomenon happens when a martial artist does it. Not the vertical force orientation you guys had tried but there are some videos doing it sideway (horizontally) at beer bottles. If it's real then it'd be very amazing to watch
Very cool collaboration. great video!
Imagine what Nikola Tesla could do with this information 🤔
I would love to see a slo-mo guys' episode of electricity and welding! Like striking an arc, plasma cutting, torch cutting, flux core shooting splatter, sheers and iron workers punching holes and cutting! I think you could see lots of interesting stuff! And it's super lit and easy to film! Also, a Laser engraver would be sweet!
I love when guests are so genuinely curious and into what they're doing as well. Watching all three of them learn and discover at the same time was very neat.
Super cool, was glued to the screen the whole time
dan becomes harry potter at 7:35
I've been waiting for this collab for years and I'm so happy 😭😭
I guess we're gonna need a 4090 equipped Phantom that uses AI to delete most of the "inactive" frames. Because waiting 30 minutes to find the ON point of 1 pulse is ridiculous.
This was a great collaboration!!! And I think my favorite video to date. Others have been more cinematic but this was the coolest.
So the camera is too slow. Gotta make a speed of light readout fps camera
Y’all need to get past 330,000,000
After so many videos and years following this channel, I dare to say that this one here was the most incredible and awesome video ever made. It's impressive how the technology evolved.  I'm terrified, lost of words. 11/10
These videos are WAY too long... should only be 4-5 minutes... you guys are milking this big time.
Ok, so not sure if you done it before, but how about similar using a jacobs ladder?
11:47 I heard the exact same thing that the closed captions heard...
K...  Call Mehdi back when you get a 3million fps phantom
3much than 2much
You guys have shown us things no human should ever see
Gavin saying he cannot upload a video over 12 hours, was part of a video that got uploaded to youtube that was 37 hours.
Devices throwing sparks and occasionally smoking. Isn't that just another day in an ElectroBoom video?
Thankss.
Electricity has never been good for slow motion, it always disappoints me everytime.
You should have him come back and capture images of a Tesla coil arcing across smoke or open flames and capture how it looks since smoke and flames can help bridge gaps for electric arcs. So it could get you interesting shots.
Needs lenses uv spectrums 🙂 Awesome vid thanks!
I imagine the low voltage area glows more because it has to pass more electrons with less potential across than the higher voltage area.
Wouldn't it be fair to say the last gap sparks first because it's at the highest potential first? There may be electrons traveling between the others first, to reach that point, but something has to be led by a higher potential, to begin ionizing the air.
Mehdi is acting meek
11:46 the camera and the what now??
So i was thinking of what gavin said earlier, but dan probably is the most photographed person in history... being the subject of a ton of the slowmo videos, he's probably in several hundred million photographs  (probably even more)
Oh right it's gonna be "shocking" Video
so making a " realistic "   wizard battling with lighting would be like them poiniting at somebody and they start falling down and massive Clap of thunder and arc from the wizards finger to the adversary's forehead
This was a cool video, thanks for sharing it was great to see the electroBoom guy.
Magic
Mehdi is such a good teacher
remember:  always tune to maximum smoke ! ! !
This is hands down my favorite collaboration!
0:04 I make a slow motion of you guys in 0,25x 😂 that's cool
Excellent Video - Well done :)
what an epic crossover!
We need more experimental engineer type dudes like this guy. They are the ones who make the true discoveries.
Yesssssssssssssss! Today just got better!
Why doesn't the the spark travel by the shortest distance? ie a straight line.
Safety first.
emperor palpatine vibes
YES! I've been waiting for this colab for years!
The UV light from the first spark gap to fire will actually prompt the others to spark in sync by aiding in the process of ionizing the air, this is why these things fire more reliably when the spark gaps all have line of sight like in the video.
The collaboration the world needs right now.
Faster cameras exist, so contact those labs, show them your video, and ask for their help. Inquiring minds want to know!
Amazing colab!
Dan comes off as if he doesn’t know anything, but you have to remember he’s a special forces demolition expert lol
Going to need this same collaboration done again sometime!
Thank you kindly to the person who had the brain cells to put the headphones warning. Nice addition 👍
Medhi looks like a fun guy to hang out with and do cool electronics experiments lmao
"Pure unedited reality"
Thank you for the headphone warning. Damn tinnitus
"seems to be running at the speed of light almost".......come on guys, you can make that happen, right? :)
Can someone tell me if electricity contains molecules ? Is that a chtewpid question lol ? I'll Google it Thanks for this video, I really enjoyed it !
the very last one goes first because it's the negative side and electrons are the ones that move in a circuit.
Something that I've been waiting... thanks 😊 🤘✌️
16:00 The last one arcs first because the energy flows through the fields around the apparatus not through its wires. The last one has the lowest resistance so that's where the air gap is breached first.
Oh!! And just realized I haven't seen a new ElectroBoom video for a while.
That dude still have the  S9!
Mehdi acts like an idiot, but he's fricken' brilliant.
Like 👇if you're as brain dead gamer as me, that you read it "Electronic Arts" at first  :D
Two sonicators tip to tip!
awesome to watch, we need to find a way to travel at that speed.
collab with SmarterEveryDay again, the combo of his scinece and yalls skill at imagery and sound design is something i crave!
Never seen Mehdi in such good production values and good lighting. No offense Medhi. Haha yes I’m spelling it wrong on purpose.
Remember that often in these electric systems the current is technically going backwards through the system at the same time as it is gong forward. Right up until the moment it is connected then they all discharge at once. If you could see the electrons you would see them all moving too.    Source: I'm a random guy on the internet that watched a video of another guy who ran a big long cable around a field to test this. I am probably wrong in this case.
I wonder if the results would be the same if this demonstration was repeated under 6 billion frames per second.
YEESSSSS!! I have been waiting for this episode!  Thank you Mehdi, Dan, and Gav!  You are all amazing and so entertaining.  Thank you thank you thank you
Medhi is a legend of an engineer, he's so knowledgable even when they're talking about the frames in slow motion. It was nice to see him on here, the engineering material he does works so well with the slow motion stuff.
finally, my dreams have become reality
"I don't think you can upload videos longer than 12 hours anymore" - obviously shot before Uno: Infinite...
Ъ
The fact that the 875k and 1.75million shots look exactly the same, really shows how fast it really is
The 1.7 million barely looks slower than low 100,000's.
This was way awesome.
kkwkwkwwwk electroboom niccee
Glad you guys finally got together!!!! lmao much love!!!
Tesla coil plus room fan?
This is the collab I have been wanting for years!! so glad it finally happened!!!
I'd like to see the arcs with a thermal camera, to possibly see the air temperature between arcs,    do they make a high speed thermal camera??
16:00 It makes sense that the lower voltage with fire first because it takes time for the voltage to build up.
niiice!
terrible chemistry between you guys. good thing the physics were good.
This is my favorite day ever
electric fluff? 🤪 it looks like plasma or corona discharge   cool!
Gavs scare reaction was beautiful
I ask a stupid question. I know the answer, but why is that answer right? Why is a spark not straight? The answer; because it follows the path of least resistance. But how do tiny differences in 'resistance' overcome the great energy of the spark? It must be that the spark is only just 'making it' through the air (or that the attraction of 'earth' is so weak), for small differences to have such an effect. But even so, at each deviation of the spark it eventually returns to it's target.  So at each point the spark is subject to many many possibilities of direction. And the slightest weakness in 'resistance' allows it to get nearer to it's necessary destination. Mmmm. Not sure I'm any further forward there. Good job guys.  AND why was the repeating spark so clearly similar in shape to the one just before??? It cannot be just the air conditions, because they are so changeable, even over a short time I guess? Could it be surrounding electromagnetic fields?
Dan and Gav, at the cutting edge of cocking about.
The best Collab ever!!!
I love how Mehdi's instantly like "enough of this x-hundred thousand nonsense! show me a million!"
I politely request 1.75m FPS or nothing merch please.
Best collab ever.
Love both channels, very fun and informative. Also love as the build up of excitement and progression of the video so did the build of chemistry between the guys. Excellent video, thanks for sharing.
omg i can't believe he's on here
You let him get within 1000 mil of your “loaned” Phantom. Reminded of beaker from the muppets, “you’re going to zap me?”,
This is absolutely the collaboration I was waiting for
"I didn't know air could blink that fast"... Uttered by almost nobody ever.
This video is a case study in how not to do high voltage electrical safety.
Such an awesome collab! Two great channels coming together is always fun.
Is the light produced by the electromagnetic wave a chemical reaction? The wave superheating the air between, chemically producing light?  I ask because, ignorant theory warning, would that be the cause of the final stage seeming to 'act' first? The electromagnetic wave goes down the line of the MAC, and the chemical reaction of light production follows back the other way?  And if my question is based in ignorance, any idea of where to begin the rabbit hole I've volunteered to embark on?
Phantom: I’m fast Light: 🤣🤣🤣
The fact that they meet in the middle kinda blows my mind. Do lightning bolts do that too?
the last one sparked first because the gap is smaller there is no way to acuratly measure the gap between the two points.  the path of least resistance.
30 mins later😳🤣🤣
Slow Mo Guys  with ma boi Garry Kasparov
what a collab.. YES!!
I've been waiting so long for a sequel to the longest second on YouTube, please upload all that raw footage you saved
FIRST!!!!!
It still baffles me how Gavin and Dan started as just 2 guys messing around with slow mo video in their back yard and now they're genuine experts in slow mo working with top of the line technology
If you want to upload the full video, live stream it instead, so when the stream ends, its saved past the limit
Is this a dream? Or is it real life? This is a Collab that I always dreamed of but never thought it would become real!
Particles in a cloud chamber please!!
I wish Nikola Tesla could see this.
What a fantastic youtuber combo!
This group dynamic is something I can get behind
Lights out. 😎
The crossover we def needed
Should slow mo film magic and sleight of hand
I always suspected Mehdi's experimental "hiccups" were more scripted than they apparently are lol.
I was shocked, literally. hahaha that got me
YES - I"m HERE for this collab!!
Danger Dan!
Thanks!
I wonder if the arc was in a vaccuum it would be a straighter line
On YouTube why is the video in 50fps only when you go to select the resolution
Life in the fast lane🎶🤭🤫😎
There's gotta be a way to use the arc jumping as a signal to the camera to sync the frames
(:
best channel to watch with a mysterious lump on your eye (prey for me lol)
They record at 1750000 fps, and then upload the electric ar at 5 fps, even when the video says 60 fps.
So we need to wait until Phantom makes a proper camera now 🤔
INCREDIBLE GUEST FELLAS!
Wow
Day 1 of asking Dan what watch he’s wearing, here!
that was very interesting, thanks.
That was awesome guys , you were safe with Mehdi the whole time anyone who get zapped that many time and lives knows his stuff.
Random thought, would you be able to see the air ripple from an electric shock using Schileren photography and a high speed camera? Also, great vid!
Tesla coils are so gd cool! Cheers for this one, lads!
I just learned it too. Not that hot air rises, but that the arc is heating a strip of air which then rises. That a strip of air could bold its shape. This was cool.
wouldn’t it be “the same time” because the difference between them is the speed of light * that distance?
5:36 You're a wizard Dan!
Boop
ElectroBOOM is the best :)
Instantly one of my all time favourites. I hope you guys bring Mehdi on more to play with more electricity. Finally something that can keep up with you guys ;)
Please get a powder coating gun and do slow mo powder coating it high voltage and air and paint powder being blown and would make great footage
❤electroboom
I know python scince 1 year, and I could've written you software to find those pixels XD. It should be pretty simple by just adding up the brightness of every pixel in a frame. Some frames will have a much higher value cause of the arcs. But anyway amazing video
3:38 Medhi “Let me increase the power a little bit…” Dan “What!? No…”
He always reminds me of Gary Kasparov
I think you guys should switch up the slow mo music from time to time
Big question?  Is the coil itself, negative or positive?  I am trying to see if we are watching electrons jumping from cathode to anode, or ionized air molecules jumping from the anode to the cathode. Thanks .... Mike
People have to Sub to ElectroBoom. He is absolutely hilarious and loves what he is doing.
4:15 that looks like a cgi effect
Alright, this has got to be my absolute favorite video you guys have done! It's both beautiful and absolutely fascinating simultaneously. Seriously love this vid! Well done guys!
A split second after the discharge (after 13:57 100,000 FPS shot), the first spark gap on the left has this erratic discharge which travels upward at like a 45 degree angle after the initial discharge. There are ghost like remnants between the balls a solder also after the initial discharge like it almost remembered where the path of least resistance was. Fascinating. Good job as usual guys 👍.
You all should get some footage of oil and water
I wondered if the final gap could possibly be marginally closer than the rest making it fire just before.
more video with mehdi 🇮🇷
"Can you not trust this face?" *8 seconds later* "Let me increase the power a little bit" 😂
Oh wow, this was pretty neat. Nice.
Any video with Mehdi is an instant thumbs up!
What do they mean by “fluff”
I friggen love Medhi!!!
Inches, how primitive🤣
I wonder if there is an AI program that can help look through the hours of footage and extract those you want. Since the footage from the high speed camera is so slow, most of the frames will have nothing happening, so maybe AI could find when there is a sudden change in image from frame to frame.
It's a path of ionized air
Love it :D
Leave a comment for the algorithm. =]
In case anyone was still wondering whether or not Mehdi's accidents are scripted, this video will give you the answer lol. Love you Mehdi
If you need to put your high speed camera in a Faraday cage, you know you're doin' real science.
Now you know why he calls his channel electro BOOM
I love electro boom colabs
4:20
Collab of the century!
Medhi's chaotic ways are a bliss.
I knew the last one would go first
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! THIS WAS SO COOL, I WAS WAITING FOR THIS COLLAB!
Medhi: “You know what they say” Nyquists Theorem: “am I a joke to you?”
I hope someday they make cameras that can film at millions of fps in full screen, still, these cameras are pretty good with what they can do
Awesome collaboration. Thanks guys!!!
Could the timing between sparks be measured by radio frequency? Its presumably operating at faster than 1.75 MegaHz which is in usable radio frequency.
wow. the new Harry Potter reboot looks wild
Avid viewer of both channels. It’s awesome to see a collab between both. It’s also nice to see Mehdi when he isn’t doing his shtick. As hilarious as his videos are, it’s nice to see a normal person behind them. As an electrical engineer in training, it is super interesting to watch this and consider the principals behind it. I suspect that the spark gaps are probably firing sequentially rather than instantaneously, but the time difference is probably beyond what is measurable even with the TMX. Sort of like your speed of light video. Light is not instantaneous, but it moves so fast that it really takes something incredibly special to see it. I believe theory is that electricity doesn’t move quite at the speed of light, but it isn’t too much slower than that. As you said, to accurately measure it, you would likely need at least 10M fps, maybe more.
Whoa! Mehdi is a couple feet shorter than I thought he was.
Then colab I didn’t know I needed to see
Didnt you shoot 5 million fps at some point?
I love the crossovers no one asked for they are always the best
You should use a water spray bottle and spray the air between the tesla coil and object to see how moisture in the air effects the path?
Mehdi switching between awkward nerd and evil genius is the perfect portrayal of an engineer‘s emotional range :D Thank you guys for this collab, it was so fun to watch!
Though it might have been for the bit/gag at the end (and thus, relatability with a broader audience slice), Dan, if you're excited about genuinely linking the ostensibly "obvious" concepts of hot air rising in a gravity field with electric arc behavior, then I am excited for you, as well.  As Randall Munroe might say, being 1 of the 10,000 to discover for yourself something that might be "common knowledge" is still valid to be excited about.  In the sciences, we still (a bit disappointingly) tend to only celebrate people who discover things we believe have not yet been previously discovered by anyone.  But you're allowed to feel the rush of discovering something correct/true that was not yet discovered by yourself, too.
A thought...  With welding arc starters, what appears, is a wave propagation along the welding cables, and reflection at any impedance change, and especially at the open end.  With that kind of change you get a voltage reflection and theoretically instantaneous doubling in value.  That helps firing the corona and plasma and the welding can commence.  So I am suggesting this may also explain the first streamer happening at the last spark gap of the chain?
I didn't even knew it was physically possible to save 1.7 mil frames in a second on a camera!
it isint an electroboom video is something doesnt spark lmao
I remember staying in Chicago hotels when it was extremely cold and very low humidity. The least painful way to approach a door lock with metal key in hand was to hold the key tightly.  The static build up from walking over carpets would jump an inch or more.
see no electron travle thentional diverentional displasmend towart ratio towar particle behavieure inside the copasators towar disgarges😍😍😍 was the one bevore where the last one was one frame bevore on the 0 side👀🙏😍  thank you and oll😍 oll I joy beïng🌻
The best collaboration I wished for so long!!! 30 seconds in and know: This will be great.
The  final stage's arc gap is spaced the least of all the stages and thats why breakdown initiates there. That is my guess based on whats visible from the single camera angle.
YES! You guys actually collabed! Amazing!
Please enable the "most frequently viewed" parts for your videos....
great collab
Why not put a couple of computer fans nearby and try to make an arc vortex?
ElectroBOOM looks like Rasputin from Anastasia
Best Collab ever 😂
Great video! Keep it up guys!
Dan's face "let me increase the power right now" ha ha ha
Saw a tesla coil and instantly thought of Styro Pyro
The music theme rolling in the background when they show the Slow Mo footage kind of take my mind to a heavenly place where I feel detached from time and space. Most of their old videos has this same sound. Very beautiful thing to hear. If anybody knows the name of the song... Let me know. Thank you 💜! Awesome video... as always.
Great video!! Hope you guys are able to do more together!
Not a fan of that guy
Mehdi you are so precious !!
What a fantastic groupe of nerds. I love electroboom
"Do you want me to touch it?"  Dan, it's like you don't even know us at all.
This is such a good video. Very impressive.
Awesome collab!
Dan nearly getting electrocuted to death holding the screwdriver had me crying 😂
Great to see you guys together, my 2 favourite channels 👏
Surely there must be some scanning software or AI that can speedily scan through the million frames looking for a bright area or change? Save all that manual scrubbing?
FUUUULLL BRIIIIIIDGE RECTIFIEEEEERRRRRRR!!!!
Omg yes!!!!!
Have you done camera flashes or turning on lights yet? I wonder if your camera is fast enough to observe different light bulbs turning on. LED, Halogen, CCFL, Neon, Tungsten, High-Pressure Sodium, Metal-Halide...  Side-LOL from an actual Amazon listing I just found: Safety Information: Don't eat the dang lightbulbs and don't let your kids play with them. Don't stick them in places not intended by God or camera engineers.
This was fantastic ! Thank you ElectroBOOM for the fun !
Mehdi could be such a good addition to the crew! He's great!
The collab we didn't know we needed until now.
The legendary collaboration!
Hey phantom, bois.  Time for a new camera?
مهدی به این انگلیسی‌‌ها راحم نکن
Anyone else's dogs go absolutely berserk when they played this video out loud? 😅😅
Before even watching the video I know this will be amazing
All I need to know about the Marx generator is that I feel like I've seen it on Styropyro's channel and I'm scared now "It's like someone slapping you 1000 times per second" It's quite fun to watch Medhi react to things *unexpectedly* exploding haha
I love how much fun this was for all of you. It's contagious. Great, and informative video. This was an awesome collab.
5:35 Were you ... feeling anything at all? 😂
The 'plasma' TV used to ioinze the air, which I am pretty sure what that 220KHz air was doing
Am I not the only who hears an 8-bit video game when the frequency is going up and down?
The last spark gap closes first because the circuit has to close so the other gaps can fire.
11:44 I don't think that's the way it's pronounced, Dan.
I was so disappointed when video with  ElectroBOOM was only 20 minutes, but after watching it i feel like that video is bending spacetime, i feel like i've spend so much time here, i mean in positive way
why does it hurt less when he's holding the screwdriver?
11:47 Dan says testicual
two of my favorite YouTube channels couldnt ask for a better collab
It makes you wonder if electricity is a living thing
3:31 he has such a trustworthy brow
11:48 those subtitles…
Please do a vid explaining how these cameras get such high frames per second
17:28 it does travel at the speed of light. But the speed of light is different in different media. Alpha Phoenix did a gread video about this topic.
AMAZING.....Thanks guy's.....         Shoe🇺🇸
It has finally happened
Never said it, only thought it.  Saying it here now : Gav is the european version of mcjuggernuggets.
Gav and Dan if you plug something with a strong magnetic field like a vacuum or in this case a tesla coil in the same outlet as the camera or if you place the camera close enough you will get those glitchy issues you were seeing. For instance you can plug a vacuum in with an old picture tube tv and it will interfere with the TV with visible lines. The same thing can happen with a fan and a small transformer slowing hurting the device over time
🖤⚡
Why hasn't @linustechtips water or ice cooled a slow motion camera for you guys? 🤔
my life is complete now that i get to experience the unibrow in 4k ultra hd
So... 'lightning never strikes the same place twice' is.. myth busted? because it wiggles through the air, repetitively, until it makes contact and then still blinks in and out.
Joe Gatto?
now how do i get that fps on cod
If you can get several phantoms filming the target at the same time you can reach a higher aggregated framerate
Yall should collaborate with Styropyro!!!!
I have been waiting for this day my whole live, great video!
You guys all rock
I don't know if Dan will speak to me after going through so much pain!!😈
8:20 amazing footage! I think the pulses of electricity travel multiple times through the same already ionized air(path)! Very cool
very nice
This was amazing!! It’s so cool to see things in our world at such an obsurd frame rate. Just seeing the arc move instantly at 1.75 million is absolutely insane. I hope we can see more of this framerate, so coolll!
Exciting video, thank you!
SQUEEEEEE!!!! Two of my favorite channels!!!! Wheeee!!!!
9:55 i can definitely see Dan battleing the dark lord on a graveyard there...
No way. I literally was just making a meme with pink panther after I had already opened this video and paused it to play some games and the first song played is pink panther. Such an odd coincidence lmao.
That capacitor gadget sparking on the final gap then setting off the others could be acting like a TX antenna, where voltage is highest at the tip of an antenna and highest current at the base? Could this be a visual of how a TX antenna works? Pretty cool!
Air can totally blink that fast:  that's how the EG&G Microflash works.  It's used for the famous "freezing a bullet" type pictures and generates a discharge in air, providing a flash well under a microsecond in duration.
😮🎉
so can you influence the arc path by pre heating a section of air in between the two points?
One of the best collabs that we didn't thought we wanted, BUT WE NEEDED IT..........
16:08 might have a reason similar to the Veratasium discussion on how long it takes for an electrical signal to be sent through a long piece of wire. Electrical transmission line for example...?
A joy to see. Best of luck!
Why are you guys filming in such a dark environment? I thought you have to use these cameras in a really bright area. Is it because of how bright electricity is, or…?
Huh... ya know, they have a point.  As much slow motion as they've filmed, as often as Dan has been on camera, and as slow as they film sometimes... Dan may actually be THE most photographed human on the planet by technicality.
I'd imagine the gaps on that array would affect which arcs first? Don't know how precise they are....
The three stooges find electricity
MEHDi is a true legend
my face when I saw they collaborated 🤯
woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow
This might just be one of my favourite episodes.
I'd really love to see you colab with @SteveMould next, not sure what you'd do but he does some great stuff that would look amazing with a phantom.
Looks like my pc
Finally! :D
Too bad you guys were here in Bc!  Would have been awesome to get a meet and greet!
Well, yes, the arcs follow each other because they follow the air’s ionization, which makes it conductive.
This is the guy who keeps electrocuting himself for content. Mad respect.
Hi Gavin, can I ask how you did the sound of the slow mo tesla arcs? It sounds brilliant
😂💟💜
Mehdi is easily one of my favorite YT personalities. Stoked that y'all collaborated with him. Haven't even watched this yet and I know it'll end up as my favorite Slow Mo Guys video to date.
😂 electric fluff = plasma 👍
Mehdi's laugh of glee. I'll remember that.
Well that was very interesting. 🤔 But we know there's a camera that can record the speed of light.
6:06 there appear to be plasma “filaments” that bridge the gap and collapse in on each other. So cool.
Everybody loves Mehdi!! :D
I feel like the only way to top this is splitting an atom. Good luck, boys. lol
Is it possble to slow motion something going more than 476 000 miles per second? (speed of light)
Need a follow up video on this.  Would be nice to see a longer circuit with way more spark gaps, this should increase the chance that you catch them sparking in different frames.  It would also be cool to see the tesla coil firing in heavy rain.  Maybe using saltwater or baking soda and water mix.
Two of my favorite channels at once.... AWESOME VID GUYS!
Great co-lab video!
There is a camera at one of the universities in the USA that is fast enough record at light speed. It’s about 3 trillion frames a second I think. You need to collaborate with the university to record these devises
Is that the same guy that made the guitar with copper wires or something in the super old video ?
I like it how electro boom cant even escape his electric fails in a different channel
Dan's faces during this. "what are you talking me into boy?"
i wish they did the single 1hz shock at 1.75m frames
You look good in OLED
I took out my dried clothes a couple nights ago and saw little sparks of static, which made me wonder when you guys would be doing a video like that. Call me satisfied!
Say tesla coil fast 10 times...
best colabs
You had me at electroboom
HE HACKED THEIR CAMERAS!
You guys had better do this again when 50 million fps photography becomes available to you; this was *fascinating*.
YeeeY same as the normal camera shows 😂😀👌👌 Awesome reaction! Also Hot air rises !!!  goood one :D
Could you use a slower (less powerful) camera to approximate where in the hours of footage you would need to look to find a clip? Start both the main and secondary camera simultaneously and calculate how many frames the shot is into video by using the time from the start of the recording in real time and the frame rate of the main camera to find the frames where the shot would be.
yes. YES
What a wholesome collaboration that is. Just science nerds investigating a question nobody would ever think to ask with awfully expensive tools
"It's like it's running at the speed of light almost" haha
Ionising particles and excess free radicals form the second pathway, hence lightening can strike twice...
ElectroBOOM <3 <3
I never ever thought Id see Electroboom with Dan and Gav.
Ok what? *This guy is a legend!!!*
me: why not to everything at the fastest speed possible?  someone: 1 second is like 19 hours  me: oh
How would humidity and other environmental factors help or hurt the videos?
Love this collab! :D I'm here from Mehdi's channel--ElectroBOOM's videos are amazing (and FUNNY!). It's not a Mehdi video unless SOMEONE gets shocked, and this episode ✅ !  Both your channel and his excel in your musical selections and visuals! Awesome sauce, from England, respect! 🙌🙌🙌👏👏👏🥳🥳🥳⚡⚡⚡🎇🎇🎇🔥🔥🔥
It probes that stuff works thanks to smoke. When smoke goes out, stuff stops working 😄👍
Thanks
I wonder what the spacing is on the last metal bits? They can't all be identically the same spacing, perhaps that affected the timing of the spark? Not sure why none of the others seem to have been affected...
They say lightning never strikes twice in the same spot, but it sure looks like it would if the cloud could recharge fast enough
So the camera is electric and you are trying to capture electricity. 😮 how does that work
Nice to see Gav fueled on Greek yogurt and granola for this video
Great video! ElectroBOOM is amazing!
Finally found something too fast to film for the Slo Mo Guys. Amazing!
Mehdi brought me here...
5:32 Absolute meme potential
Please warn headphone users. Ha
this is so amazing to see!
Incredible! I've been waiting for a collab like this for years! It's really cool to see all the fast details of an electrical breakdown, even for a couple of frames. But also you can see why the study of spark discharges (like from Marx) is so difficult - the time scales are just out of this world. That's why in that field the oscilloscope is your best friend - you can measure the voltage with nanosecond precision easily and make conclusions about the circuit's operation. For example, I've measured the output voltage of a small Marx once and was able to see as the voltage jumps to 1/4, 3/4 and finally to the full output potential. I suppose that was the effect of individual spark gaps firing at different times.   Interestingly, the process of electrical breakdown has been studied extensively in the 1930s-1960s without the use of Phantoms (obviously). Back then they used streak cameras based on electro-optical image converters. The image of the spark would be converted to an electron beam and electrically swept across the receiver end of the camera, with equivalent FPS being in the tens of millions range.  Once again, just phenomenal job from Mehdi, Gavin and Dan, the obtained footage is unique!
HOLY... THAT IS LIKE A DREAM COLLAB COME TRUE. I had to pause and run for beer and popcorn! I love Mehdi!
10:24 what if, at those timeframes with those energies, light itself is slowed down so much that it can be seen "vibrating", a bit like air does when a thunder strikes? maybe a true "on/off" demonstration could be done only at much larger frame ratios.
awesome
Epic collab
Looks to me like you guys had a bang up experience filming this video! Dan gets shocked and Medhi is only to happy to oblige!  👍👍💥💥💥💥👍👍
editors after watching 1.75 million f/s videos.. i am done.. i am not paid enough.. 🤣🤣🤣
Mehdi is very much a "go big or go home" kind of guy...
Try it in a clear tube under vacuum, then a sealed tube with nitrogen.
Both awesome and fascinating! Thank you!
I was waiting for Dan to say Expecto Petronum!!
The episode where you guys filmed the monsoon and actually caught the lightning bolt mid travel was my favorite episode
Now we need to see a bigger coil.
I love how nice Electroboom is in this video and how dangerous and crazy he makes himself seem in his channel.
I can say only one thing... FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER !!!
Phantom every youtuber ?
Wow, so many collabs I never expected, but greatly appreciate 😄.
The collab we didn’t know we needed
Time for faster camera’s, to fast for E Boom.
This is the best of both worlds coming together, and my life is complete.
The awkwardness in the air 🤣 I love it
Super interesting… does the electro magnetic force have a delimiter less than the speed of light? Is the information transmitted to ajoining electrons via quantum mechanics? Imagining a setup with 480 or more power input and unimaginable high speed cameras.
I have long found the existence of oddly descriptory words in science strangely comforting. That sometimes scientists lets go of the latin and ancient greek words and deites and just names stuff in very understandable terms.   My two favourite examples has long been "The Big Splat" (the collision that probably formed our moon) and "Spaghettification" (what probably happens to bodies that passes rhe event horizon of Black Holes)  Now a third word has entered that vocabulary for me... "Electrical Fluff" (the tendrils of electrical energy that searches for something to arch with)
I only really know this guy from that video of him playing an electric guitar..... That he made himself... It didn't look pleasant... 🤣
17:44 lol So subtle. xD
Now we need a collab with demo ranch.
12:46 The Marx generator, the only marx that actually produce something !
220 kH...? I would have guessed closer to 219...
i might be wrong, but with arcs you were trying to film the speed of light.
That was super interesting!
Dan's robe is perfect
Brilliant collaboration with ElectroBoom, please see his video it is hilarious
Slow motion is when Gav is running out of the spark :)
I feel like this channel is on an inevitable collision course with the speed of light.  Slow Mo Guys filming light:  an unstoppable force and an immovable object!
The only reason that I believe that it is firing the last one first is because it has to complete the circuit so it would go to the end stop at the positive and negative and then it would Arc the other negatives with the positive completing the circuit
Hey dude, heard you like arcs on your arcs
MAybe try the glas breaking experiment again with 1,75 mio FPS.
What if you had a fan blowing thru the arc? Or better yet, blow (carefully)?
Why was it playing a song at the beginning?
Dude I cant believe it! Last night i dreamt you were making this collab! lol
You lot have just.. ALL the crossovers :D Love it.
Great video guys.  It wouldn't surprise me to find this used in science classrooms all over the world.  Amazing to think that even at the Phantom's top speed light is still traveling on the order of about a mile between frames.
Two of my favourite youtube creators collabing?!?!   HELL YES!!!
It seems like if you could trigger the recording to begin remotely with a relay that synchronized with the battery terminal and some sort of fuse on the other that toggled the button off you could get tighter timing without having to search through so many dead frames.
SloMo + ElectroBOOM i love it :D
This guy is a hilarious addition to your channel!
What I learned from all of this is that we need a software to run on the high speed camera that sifts through the millions of recorded frames and pinpoint the frames in which the biggest changes happen
The output of the horizontal transformer should be 8 KV, and the ten stages doubler should theoretically double the 8 kilovolts for ten times, enough to produce hard X-rays. But the multistage doubler (or voltage multiplier) should be immersed in dielectric oil to achieve such unholy voltage. ALSO. For some reasons, in parallel to each capacitor there is a spark gap; from the spacing, it should trigger at 20 KV. Such spark gaps alter fundamentally the operation of the voltage multiplier, because they produce a spark at approximately the same voltage. But they are triggered simultaneously because the first spark gap that will produce a spark, it will also trigger inductively all the others at the same time. The principle of paralleling spark gaps is old, and was used by the first radio transmitters to increase the output power.
That’s so cool. Your videos never fail to amaze me
Electricity propagates at near the speed of light depending on the medium. The electrons are slower though. Anyways, the speed of light is roughly 3*10^8 or ~300 million m/s. So to capture light moving 1m in 1 frame you would need 300 million fps to get that. In short... I'm not sure that you would have been able to capture electricity moving over that circuit within one frame.
What a collab this is
The Slow Mo Guys: "We have 1.75 million FPS now!!!" ElectroBOOM: "This isn't gonna be enough. BTW, I've burned through all the fuses in the building when you were looking the other way."
500 nanoseconds is what? 0.00000005 of a second? That's insanely quick
When I saw ElectroBoom on the title, I knew Mehdi will done something interesting and it'll be in slo mo♥️♥️.
The Marx Generator triggers at practically at the speed of light. The UV from one stage of the Marx Generator helps trigger the rest of the spark gaps together. Essentially turning a parallel arrangement of caps/resistors into a series one.
So is there a limit on how many frames can be in a sec? I mean on a physical level not on what we can do at the moment.
YES!!!!!!!!
Mehdi should tell his circuit that smoking is bad for it's health
Watching paint dry……at 1.75M frames per second.
This video begins as a meme, and is a meme till the end. Tf haha
Here's an idea for the longest video ever.  How about filming Colin Furze tunnel building at 1.75M frames second.
Been waiting to see something like this!!!! Boom!!! Good job guys!
fr the greatest collab
I misread this title, clicked, reread, then screamed. Absolutely smashing
17:30 570 nanoseconds per frame
the screwdriver was broken :)
lmaooo
Should collaborate with styropyro
It'd be interesting to repeat this in microgravity where the hot air from the bolts wouldn't float upward... Ya'll need to talk SpaceX into letting you take a Tesla coil and the Phantom into orbit!
Yoo this guy 😂😂🔥
Legendary collab
3:28 got to love how Dan immediately looks down, because clearly the answer is "heck no" lol
That camera is so fast that light moves only 170 meters every frame. You might actually be able to capture some wicked light speed slow-mo with it. Its crazy!
electro boom this guy is smart and funny I wonder what his life is like
What if you blow air past the spark :D
(This is a comment from my son) U GUYS ARE EPIC😁 and I have a question can u do Dan hitting water balloons with a tool that can pop the balloons and I’m a MASSIVE FAN. Also I love this vid it was so cool😎.(thanks for making this vid!!!!!!!!!!!!) ;).
Shocking discovery…….thank you
My fingers were tingling the whole episode!
Need more firearms content.
I love how one of the recommendations related to this video is "PREVENTING ELECTRICAL FIRE & SHORT CIRCUITS".
could the blinking of the arc be from the superheated air the electricity went through glowing like a hot piece of metal?
Seriously faces 😐
Love how you still use the same music you've always used for the slow-mo, the low choir music, harkens back to the olden days
In order to capture something moving across what looks like a 15" gap that travels at 186,000,000 miles per second, I'm thinking 1.75M fps is painfully insufficient. Gotta either make the gap 1,000 times larger or the frame rate 1,000 times faster.  It was a nice try though.  Best of luck on your next attempt!
Petition to create an Instagram account with 1.75 million photos of Dan taken in that second
Love the team up!
The Phantom Menace strikes again
I've wanted you guys to film electric arcs for years now, I was hoping for Photonicinduction but Electroboom is a worthy alternative :)
Let's just casually record nearly an exact 1/2 year of footage (minute reading x2 came to 365.27778 days) in what was really no time at all!
That's a .5uS timelapse photo. You're filming an effect that moves 1-1/3 football fields in a single frame (450+ feet). Wile E. Coyote sad face.
Love it!!
I am... the law!
This is the best video you guys have ever made.
Thanks for the video guys, I loved this one!
internet tiene muchos momentos épicos... considero este uno de ellos.
I don't know about "learned", but you did reaffirm that for sufficient power anything can be a fusible link.  Reminder: Do not be the fusible link.
Oh sugar!
Sometimes reality looks more fake than cgi. This is one of those times😂
i just felt that you uploaded again and you did! happy days!
TIL what Dan TIL.
👍👍
Much love to you Mehdi! ❤️ ⚡️
Great collab!  I guess you guys will just have to meet up again when the cameras get a wee little faster!  hehe
I love electro boom it’s amazing he’s here with you guys, actuallly freaking amazing
Nerds!
The arcs in the first half of this video look like quantum probability paths resolving into a single time line when observed
I believe that rather than the voltage being high and causing mini arcs (as stated around 6:40) I believe those are actually the "feelers" that search for a ground, and as soon as one finds one, it will finalize the bolt and send the rest of the current through the main bolt, but it's so fast that you happened to catch it on the same frame. You can see this on some of the previous shots where the tip spreads to these hair thin strands that fan out, searching for the quickest path with least resistance :)
Great collab...love his sense of humor
This was fantastic!
Mehdi 18:26   "Finally.."
Nature is amazing
Dam it why did I see the same advert 4 times
Yessssssssss
SlowMo and ElectroBoom?! thats a colab that everyone needs!
In case of arcing from the last capacitor I also noticed that the ark there is short, maybe ark starts there because it is the shortest path
9:53 Some Harry Potter stuff
Electroboom has been featured in quite a lot of videos these past few months and I love it, Electroboom is a great channel and great personality.
Last time I watch Medhi, I renamed him NicoLOL TesLAAARGH
ElectroBOOM! Now you're talking! :D
Cooool
when something is happening so fast, That slowing it down by 1.75 million results in a simlar thing to what you would get with a normal speed camera, you know you subject is a level of fast that is hard to fathom
How can a photon be filmed but the Marc's generator arc can't be?
3:37 - I think I need a slo-mo video of Dan reacting to Mehdi saying "let me increase the power a little bit" right after Dan's agreed to touch the electric thing. Seem like mere milliseconds between him saying that, and Dan's head whipping around to look at the device that's about to ruin his day.
This is what we all have been waiting for. Hope you guys had fun with this crazy guy lol
Now get styropyro on here next
I did my part of watch'n the video at .25x
I find this video excessively interesting. Electricity is so cool
unedited reality. this is nuts
I love when 2 seperated people i watch are in the same video
Me 3 seconds in: Oh no…
I love this collaboration!
The closed captions are hilarious
That's quantum mechanics i reckon.
Even on someone else's channel, ElectroBOOM just can't resist blowing something up.
In the first μs I knew, sth will blow up, till a minute passes 😂
the collab we didnt know we needed🙌
The best collaboration EVER!
If the resonance frequency is 220khz, if you filmed at a multiple or divisor, would you lose the flashing? Like 880,000 fps?
The sparks even better iff you sloving the video 0.25 slover.👍
at some point we reach the frame rate of the Simulation
Poor Dan, I wonder how may braincells he fried
It's almost as if it travels with the speed of light, and then you need to capture images at terraframes second. Or you could make it bigger, so the distance is larger.
I love your videos so much
⚡Big trouble in little china vibes off this episode!! ⚡
5:36 Straight outta an old Doctor Who episode 😂
If memory serves, the speed of electrical signals in copper is about half the speed of light. Given the ladder is about 30cm long, that implies is takes about 2 nanoseconds to travel along it.... so you need to filming at more like a *billion* frames per second!
Obviously they can't spark all "at once" due to the speed of causality. But at 1.75M FPS causality (or light) travels at roughly 100 meters per frame, too fast for the camera to see. But if they ever make a 175,000,000 FPS camera, we might start seeing it.
This is happening in everyone’s brain many times a second (at a much lower voltage)
Is the repeated arc the potential doing a “ring down” as the voltage tries to find another path after charging up the body and not having anywhere lose to go?
After all these years of filming slo mo Dan probably actually is the world's most photographed man ever
he has the patience of a 12 year old at Christmas lol
Hello Asin(Bx)+k my old friend…
The perfect colab!
YES
My mind when you guys were talking about science stuff, this was my brain… 🤯🤯🤯
@15:11 how come I didn't see an arch on the third shock on the blue wire on the right.
Idea : create an Instagram account and post all 4142484 frames, one frame per day.
Сделайте перевод на русский,пожалуйста)))Очень интересно
Slow Mo Guys more ElectroBOOM It's double the fun. Too much.
Slow Mo Guys 2: We Need To Go Faster  COMING THIS FALL!
The best SMG videos are the ones that are slightly dangerous (usually at Dan’s expense)
Shibby
This collaboration was highly unexpected and most welcome
AMAZING!  More collaborations please!!!
One thing I love about slow mo videos of really fast things is that a lot of times it looks like bad CGI but it's real.
It's not an electroboom video without things blowing up, catching fire, or violently shocking himself.
Can't wait till you guys get a time machine and slow mo the beginning of the universe! 🤞
Makes me wonder what else we fail to perceive of our reality.
I love youtube collabs!
Got to say it. 50 Hertz and 100 kills you.
Man, 3 awesome YouTubers, electrical arcs & slow mo video! Made my day!
Wow, electrical ark is so scary fast. Good attempt at the 1.7million however we need to go faster.
THE COLLAB I NEVER KNEW I NEEDED UNTIL I HAD IT OMG YES
This one was awesome, guys!
If the resonance happens reliably say 8 times and very periodically, you can count the frames and divide by 8. Should give you a slightly more accurate reading. This is sorta how digital signal analyzers sample a 40 GHz repeating digital wave when their sample rate is actually something much slower like 5 billion samples/sec.
Well, considering light travels 300 million meters per second, if you wanted to see the progression of arcs through the sequence, you'd probably need something like 30 billion frames per second to guarantee capturing it.
I really hope you collab again for something - this was extremely interesting to me!
Glad you guys are back! Best channel on yourtube!
Holy cow this is so beautiful.
This dude is clever and I love it all this video is brilliant
Perhaps the arc shows first on the last jump because its at the end and doesnt have enough time to fully disappear, i mean if its never in the first flicker when turned on it would only make sense
oh my god the mad lads brought the best boy on
This is like when the TMNT met up with the Power Rangers
Watching solder and flux together would be sweet to watch
Fascinating!
Could you see the heat of the arcs with the Schlieren effect?
You guys have excellent chemistry together and should do more of this collaboration!  Great video
I am ready to bet real money that Mehdi is secretly (or unconsciously) sadistic, I have seen him having fun while electrocute Linus and now poor Dan. Dan should get an honorary Guinness Book record for most types of traumas experienced during filming TSMG. 😂
I have no clue if this is possible but slow mo schlieren imaging for the tesla coil would be epic.
The collaboration we all needed :D
Two of my favorite channels.  This was really awesome, a bit shocking.
do more science stuff is cool looking and very educational studying is goooooood!
How would the electricity react if it was in a cooler with dry ice or liquid nitrogen, would the colder Air affect it in anyway?
did any one else laugh at the silly noise it makes
Electroboooom.  Nice to see you here.
So that's where Mehdi has been.
You said the activity started in the last node, but isn't that as expected, since electrons move the opposite way as the way we draw electricity?
Gav has finally met his match in the Hair department. Look at those arms 🤣
If you put a fan blowing in front of the coil, disturbing the ionized air channels, would that allow for new arcs to follow new random paths, instead of repeating the previous ones?
Working with Phantoms and searching for that one segment of spark is no joke. I was lucky to film with Phantoms a few videos back, and it gives me a huge appreciation for what Gav and Dan did for this video. What great footage you guys captured, resonant frequency and all.
Wouldn't be a Mehdi video without at least one boom right? I freaking love colabs!!!! Please do moar!!
yall enjoy that annoying tv buzzing transition
Awesome video, I love ElectroBOOM!
"Another day, another video lets try to electrocute myself in a new innovative way with 4K resolution" Madi 😈😂
Electro Boom no
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
If there's not an exposition in the first 10 seconds of a video with electroboom you've done it wrong
11:47 when Dan says "Tesla coil" I was sure I heard him say "testicule"
I would love to see the slow mo of a Tesla Coil built with a level shifter. There isn't a lot of information about DC biased AC corona/streamers/arcs and other stages of air plasma breakdown. I'm interested in the electrophoresis/dielectrophoresis of air plasmas, electrons and neutral gas species in non-linear or asymmetrical electric fields. Ethan Krauss patented ion wind thruster designs are HV DC circuits of exceptional power to weight ratio, but AC waveforms are often used for dielectric barrier discharge designs because they have some advantages over DC plasma discharges. I'll keep looking to see if I can find any laboratory examples of level shifted plasma generated circuits, but I suspect that one polarity works better than the other for acceleration of air due to the dielectrophoresis of neutral gases of different dielectric constants.
what an unexpected collab that was super fun to watch 😂
Do you guys remember the Veritasium riddle on how long it takes for a lightbulb to turn on, if the cables are extremly long, but the bulb sits next to the source? If your camera records at 1,5 million FPS light would travel only 200 m during two frames. So maybe if you use a km of cables and lamps that switch on incredibly fast it could be possible to actually visualize this effect. For example: 3 lamps (or any other device visually reacting on current), one at the middle of the cable and one at the start and end, but all are equally distanced from the source. All should switch on at the same time.
I know you guys fake the audio for lack of a better way to have audio on such slow video but with something like this, couldn't you just take the brightness of the arc near the spike on the Tesla coil you could probably turn that into audio.
Why did you not use the HPV camera? You could have done a lot more fps.
This is so good collab
11:49 The what isn't broken sorry?? 😂
It goes backwards cause electricity goes backwards. people normally think of electricity as positive moving towards negative which is how the coil is arranged (left to right). But in reality, it's negative electrons moving towards a positive charge, so as soon as the connection is made, electrons flow right to left along the coil. There is a delay between gaps that is the amount of time it takes for current to form after connection, which is measured in pico-seconds. meaning they would have to measure close to a few billion fps to see the delay.
Finally, great collab!!!
I'd love to see the electricty in a vacuum!
Call of duty sniper be like 10:22
Easily one of the best collabs, guys.  Well done and here's to more of The ElectroSLOW Guys
Amazing collab! Do not try this at home kids, Dan, Gav and Mehdi are trained professionals! 😎
My two favourite You tube channels merged the love for science! Well done guys!
I have been waiting for this matchup
the awkwardness was palpable immediately, and it made me love medhi even more
Should see what styro pyro can cook up for you two
Cool
How much terabytes was that video?
19:21 I sincerely hope Dan let a fat one rip after that
At 17:42 Medhi says it's travelling almost at the speed of light. I thought it did.
oh god!!  what a collab
Each second recorded at 1.75m frames takes 16 hours 52 minutes to watch at 24fps. 🤯
He's their slightly differently crazy uncle.
Gav, where did you get the sound for the arcs to touch? That's definitely not just squashing a watermelon
This is really cool... cant wait for a faster phantom
Nice video
The flinch at 15:11 - you can tell Dan has been zapped before ⚡
So cool!
I’ve been working on a comic, and the inspiration I’ve gotten from this channel has been otherworldly
Nothing can beat electricity in slow mo.
On god, literally 2 days ago I watched an electric boom compilation and was thinking how cool it would be to see some of that in slow mo - instantly thougth of Gav and Dan lol next stop how redicilous - don't think there is a lot of need of slow mo, but would be a great vid and Dan can finally take a break from getting hurt, unless Gav decides to record him falling from the tower lmao
Just worth noting here, that since electricity moves at ~300,000,000m/s, that means that at 1,750,000fps light would travel approximately 170 meters per frame.  So if this is propagating through the Marx Generator at anywhere near the speed of light, this camera isn't remotely fast enough to capture that speed.   So it is still possible that these don't trigger at exactly the same time but it will be very hard to confirm that (at least using this type of camera as the measurement tool)
There will be papers written about this video.
How strong are the fields if they can mess around with your equipment like that?
That was awesome. Thanks for sharing.
Mehdi knows what he wants. “Don’t give me those weak sauce tiny framerates, 1.75 Mil!”
I'm disappointed that your camera is too slow to catch the Marx cascade, but it's _amazing_ knowing that the Marx cascade has been shown to be at least within the expected range to this degree of accuracy ;)
“It’s almost like it operates at the speed of light” 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
cool tesla coil
"Its quite a distance, like 4 or 5 inches"  That's the confidence boost I needed. 😎
Medhi is a real solid guest, taking the piss and all. One of the most fun guests you'd had
We need more collabs!
The collab of the decade
You three guys were having just way too much fun!
Still not sure If that guy is a professional or a crazy person or both.
Greatest crossover in YouTube history.
To the idea of how many frames (datapoints) you need to get a good resolution to define the maximum of the peak: It’s common sense that there should be 13 points, at least. A solid data situation for peak modulation is 20 points. So, you have an idea how much faster you have to film for a proper peak resolution.  Love your videos!
MEHDI IS KICKS! 😂 Excellent video, boys! 10/10!
Hello!
YAY!!
The best collab in years!
Excellent - thank you
Dan: Ihave connected the two dots... I have connected them  XD
Holy man crush
Please do a season of collaborations for while we really need some ❤️❤️❤️
The irony of watching the Slow Mo Guys in x2 speed
I'm watching Top Gear from early 2000s. In Series 2 Episode 1, James May is introduced and he reminded me of Dan, the way he spoke and his mannerisms. But only in that one episode.
AAHHHHH SO HAPPY FOR THIS!!!  ever since he said this was happening i was so excited to see!!.... this even exceeded expectations!!
My two favorite YouTube channel together 🔥😍
I never realized they were in the US. You should definitely do a collab with Kentucky Ballistics, especially his gun explosions video.
Electroboom!
Marx Generators are known to turn on their spark gaps in Nanoseconds. So I would have been very surprised if the progression of the arcs had been visible instead of them all turning on seemingly at the same time.
Is there a difference between sparks from AC current and DC current?
The two videos are great together. I hope they increase the number of subscribers for both channels.
10:46 arcs looks like electro's arcs from old spiderman cartoon series or old movies
this is by far the best colab on youtube
Please, stop using these ethereal background sound on your videos. It's extremely annoying. Please !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Do you think if he made his contraption longer it would be easier to see if they light up at different times?
You'd need a frame rate so high, there wouldn't be enough photons reaching the camera to see anything/
I mean, technically it's not "simultaneously" BUT do you really want to count the speed of light as not instantaneous?
Best...Collab...ever
I love Medhi. You can tell immediately how genuine he is and how much he absolutely loves what he does. So much fun to watch him with Gav and Dan
Shocking stuff... So electrifying to watch  ;)
Very interesting video !
electroboom is such a legend. so glad he was in the vid
I hear Mehdi and Dan talking about how many fps to bump up the phantom and I just picture Gav inwardly cringing at the sheer size of that raw video file.
Amazing 🔥
Awesome collaboration!  Spark-gap switches turn on really fast, about 10 nanoseconds from initial current flow to peak current.  Let us hope that the 200,000,000 fps Phantom is on the drawing board.
The Slow Mo Guys + ElectroBOOM  >>  insta-like!!!
First thing that comes to my mind is. How does the camera deal with the immense EMI. Fairly impressed that they had no issues at all. This was an awesome video. Thanks.
Shocking
WHAT IF you would make this bang machine long enough, let's say to the moon. And if all these bangs happen simultaneously then you could have information faster than the speed of light. If the information is the same as in Lord of The Rings with their fire stacks on the mountains to tell that they have a problem.  With the bang machine it would be the same. You wouldn't really transport information, you would just have the same event really far away from each other at the same time. And only the knowledge of that fact would be the information. BAM!!! FTL-ALERT!
I really wanna be a electrical engineer now
Buy multiple phantoms and have them staggered trigger time, then you could film faster?
When even 1.75 million frames a second isn't quite enough.  A quick Google search says that lightning, which is basically long distance arcing through very wet air, travels at 270,000 mph, or around 120701 meters per second. That means, according to those Google results, lightning can travel 10 cm in 0.8 microseconds or 1.2 millionth of a second.
Giving like only for Medhi!
Is it something to do with the air being moved between the contacts but not at the end? And they spark from end to start as the air ionises? Then maybe something to do with voltage drop in regard to spark brightness?
IT was going from right to left because There was the negativ attached and in physics the electrons Go from negativ to positive so thats where the electrons came from
How many times did you want him to say one point seven five?
Hot air rises, this can be seen on a Jacob's ladder too ;) If only Medi was this serious on his channel, i might go and watch
BEST. COLLAB. EVER!
Guys please, HDR! you could've shown us the Marx Generator and would not have had the issue of blowing up all the frame when it turns on.
Omg y'all were so funny 🤣🤣🤣
Video set up time Few Hours  My time watching Twenty Minutes  Actual experiment  Light Speed Total time      Worth every nanosecond  😎
I hope they have some software to skip all the dead black frames 💀
Me watching this on 60 fps
Now i wanna watch pink panther.
the collab we didn't know we needed
🔥❤️😎 Awesome! How bout Arcs in a vacuum?… 👍👍❤️🔥
Kinang ina
Given the collaboration, I honestly expected better results and footage
Ya'll discovered that the SmallHD's touch screen is affected by rogue electricity. Noted.
come on technology, keep up! we are trying to do science here..
ELECTROBOOM 😍😍
This is a video I never knew I needed. Who doesn't like slow-mo electricity?!
a shocking colab
The Slow Mo Guys: 1.750.000 FPS. Me: set playback speed 0.25 - now we have 7M FPS
19:18 please never get rid of Dan...lol  I've been with you two from the beginning...I go when he goes...
16:10 The last capacitor fires first because current flow is the opposite of electron flow.
Shame you guys never got together with PhotonicInduction !
Nice
"This Little Maneuver's Gonna Cost Us 51 Years"
1 MILLION? GEEZ
I have a theory about the spark gaps on the marx generator: I believe that the UV from the arc in the first gap Ionises the air around the gaps close to it and thus all the gaps fire almost instantaneously very close to the speed of light. But I still believe that they fire one after the other, just insanely fast. It is very interesting to see tho, how the last gap was the one that ignited first. I didn't expect that.  Great video 👍
I play minecraft with 47 fps
Incredible
So the Tesla coil is a Ray gun it’s a magnetic shield 🛡 and it’s a magnetic pulse😅
That's a collab everyone wanted to see! Thank you all
I always liked this guys because no mater how silly or crazy he may seam you can tell hes just like, crazy smart
"can you trust this face"  and that is where Dan made his last mistake
Here at 43,625 views.
When I saw Medhi in the first shot I literally screamed, "YEAAAAH!"  the collab I never knew I was desperate got
9:54 You're a wizard Harry-Dan or Danrry.
You gotta have something that pushes the electricity out like a trigger on a gun😅
I actually need to build a Tesla coil so where the f*ck do I find one? Lol
Do you get the spark from screwdriver hoing to his hand
oh my lords..... this is just insane
So what we learned was that Gav and Dan aren't slow enough and that there's more slow to be had.
Electro boom!!!!!!!!!!!!?
The colab we've all be waiting for, without knowing it :D
Let’s see how that feels… 😂 Dan’s face!!!
That was funny asf 😂😂 great collab! Even if it didn't go in the best way
Go back to the UK and get photonic induction  you know who he is
It’s not the collab we expected, but it’s the one we NEEDED!!!
amazing... just amazing
Mehdi's laugh of excitement at 15:15 just radiates his passion on electricity!!
incredible stuff
There is actually a very handy image search feature in the phantom software that would have helped us scan the images for significant changes in pixel values and found the arcs much quicker at 1,750,000. Just need to connect the phantom via ethernet to a laptop. Guess who forgot their usb to ethernet dongle for their USB-C only laptop? Heyoooooo.
Do you think anyone watches ur videos in 2x speed
Testicle's not broken? https://youtu.be/HDzVD-cqiWM?t=707
Is it possible to see 🌩️lightning underwater? And what will happen to the objects in the water?
I love learned people totally geeking out on their subject!!!  Their enthusiasm is awesome!!!   Thank you guys for another great and entertaining vlog!
One of the best and most usefull content creators on youtube
I'M SO GLAD IT FINALLY HAPPENED! THANK YOU!
Крутое видео!  Ребята, как вам такая идея? Разместить источник света рядом с камерой и поставить несколько зеркал на разном расстоянии, чтобы они отражали свет в камеру. Например, на 100 метрах, 500 метрах, 1000 метрах. С такой большой скоростью съёмки должна быть видна задержка в отражениях включения лампы из-за конечной скорости света.
Please run some anti spam program on the comment section

The cross over I didn’t know I needed till now
Ugh.   this guy.   Literally just an idiot with a camera.
That's not how you make an "electric" guitar
this is just a video of dan being tortured
Mehdi and SlowMoGuys? An unexpected combo but something absolutely amazing
I love this colab!!!!😁😁😁
Yes!!! What a collab!!! Love Mehdi!!!
Oh I’ve never been their early before!
Awesome Content!!
Loving how much math went into this episode. Great job guys
STOP youtube from putting 4k behind a paywall!
Either a faster FPS solves this(which would be mental), or they discovered teleportation of energy
11:35 Dan, your accent is making "Tesla Coil" sound real sus here bruv
Electric Goes Sus
nice video! main arcs at 8:54 for those impatient viewers
The collab we never knew we needed. And I believe Dan's found a new friend to blow up stuff I see 😂
This result does not surprise me as the speed of electricity in copper is a good proportion of the speed of light in a vacuum.
I didn't finish yet, please tell me you did this in vacuum. I want to know the diffecrence between air arcs and vacuum arcs
How did the electricity sound like the pink panther theme?? This is a genuine question btw I'm very curious lol
рашкованцам такие технологии и не снились. для них уже достижение, если туалет не на улице.
I don't know if Dan will speak to me after going through so much pain!!😈
I was watching at 0.25x so technically i am seeing the arc happening at 6.8 million frames per second
very cool stuff.    thank you!
I've been waiting for this Collab since gav mentioned he'd talked to Mehdi at the end of the "blowing up capacitors" video!
Should of tryed blowing air through the arch see if it moved and if you can blow move an arch with air
I NEED MUSIC FROM THE SLOWMOTION, THAT CALM MUSIC I NEEED IT, PLEASE NAME!!!!
Neato! 2 people who make videos on youtube that I get alerts from everytime they post videos posted videos at the same time complteley indepently to each other.
just weatching how the Tesla Coil's energy reaches out and snaps onto a path just brings some form of life to it
These guys have accidentally stumbled upon the way they simultaneous detonate all the numerous elements of an atomic bomb conventional explosive compressor implosion.
Mehdi is expressing that urge we all have - go FASTER
Yessssss! collab of the decade
I've got to ask. That camera is amazing. But if you're doing a million frames per second, how does it manage to actually save all that data! Is it just that solid state memory is that fast or is it stored in something like RAM and you have to wait for a couple minutes afterwards for the video to finish saving?
I see ElectroBOOM. I click.
Poor Dan
A very good exploration of hi speed reactions. Well done.
So much fun, at 1,750,000 frames per second! 😲😍
Хороший тамада, и конкурсы интересные)
Who's here from ElectroBoom's channel.
The Collab we all wanted.
This was a GREAT collaboration. Super fun to watch.
4:30 that cheeky little smile, got a good chuckle out of me lol
I wonder how it would behave with a fan blowing on it...
That's nuts you can actually see the AC current actually alternate between on and off. That's really something.
2:04 oh my god, He's a alive!
You know when people say ''this is next level''. This is the current top level
This was just a torture Dan video
The arc follows what is called a plasma channel that is left behind from the previous arc!
Holy cow electricity is insanely fast.
I'm only at 4:13 but it's lowkey terrifying to see where the area around the strike on Dan's finger is glowing yellow from the shock. It's like a miniature version of how people can survive lightning strikes because the absurd temperature only lasts for such an insignificant amount of time
Slow mo electro humour
I wanted to see this looooong time. Finally!! Thank you guys! 🙂👍👍
loved it, you guys are giving so much good moments to the world !
The collab I've been longing for!
Playing with electricity is fun! 😊
Okay being able to see the ACTUAL unedited resonant frequency of a tesla coil arcing is insane!!! That is crazy fast. But yes, I would love it if Mehdi comes back in a few years to revisit this idea with Gav and Dan when they have an even faster camera!
greatest crossover ever
Mehdi is such a beautiful madman.
This is just a masterclass in how to computer animate lightning bolts lol. You literally can not get better data than this, unless someone has already done this  1:20 "i wonder if they are happening at the same time" someone doesnt understand relativity lol. Things can only happen at the same time if they are in a circle, because time is relative to distance to observer  And besides relativity, all motion everywhere cascades, there is no such thing as an instant. C'mon, you of all people should know this you've watched glass crack slower than grass grows. How do you slow mo guys still think that things can happen at the same time! C'mon guys! Simultaneity is an illusion!  4:12 is a very interesting moment. The frame before the lightning concludes its search it's got tendrils all over, they're even starting to come out of the shaft of the rod. And then as soon as the lightning finds its target all those side searches go away. It searches breadth and depth concurrently. Also that tiny lightning bolt striking dan's hand makes him seem like god lol  9:23 this makes me thikn of that "why are there no aliens" "paradox". What if there are no aliens because finding humans in spacetime is like finding a needle in a temporal haystack. It's not a space problem, but a time problem. We haven't existed for long enough for anyone to really notice  I love how Mehdi is still breaking everything. I imagine these two filming styles are a bit hard to enmesh since Gav and Dan are just kind of go out for an afternoon and mess with stuff whereas Mehdi has to sit there and turn the camera off for as long as his machines are still broken lol  16:17 It makes sense to me that the jump starts at the far end. Imagine youre pulling a rope. The force of pulling of course cascades from your end downward. But the initiation point where the rope starts to act like a rope and feel tensile forces is closest to the object youre pulling, which then travels up toward the point of force. Similarly, the flow of electricity starts at the powered end, but the "tensile force" (the predilection for the energy to jump gaps, sort of practically pulling them closer as far as the energy path is concerned) would start at the far end  You can accomadate for a lack of temporal resolution with repetition. You didn't see the lead-in the second time maybe because it was just missed? But of course filtering through many of those would be an inhuman task. Wait why do you have humans doing this task anyway? Why would you sit there watching 30 minutes of black footage looking for a single moment of brightness? A computer could have thrown out all those useless frames in a second
Every day's a school day! Excellent guys. Cheers.
Damnit, curse the lack of a love react!
do it in a tube of glass with drifrent gasses in it!
The arc pathfinding is really cool to watch. I wonder if you can set up a small insulated maze and see if it can solve it.
I wouldnt have collabed with this guy. His videos are fake.
The crossover I've been waiting for
Best collab ever!
ElectroBOOM after giving everyone 5 heart attacks: Your honor, it was merely a tiny but of trolling
This is a great collaboration. I love both of these channels
I've never heard of ElectroBoom before but after watching the video 100% a sub for me lol
6:00 It's still producing all of those "feelers", but once the the arc connects, they go away. It's as if the electrons are creating probability paths and then collapsing them into one path as soon as a path is viable. Is this Quantum Mechanics on a macro scale?
What a crossover! haha
Краща колаборація всіх часів!!
Very good 👍😂😂
Wow!
Yess a new episode!!!!!!!
Love it! ⚡
YAAAAAY I am the 1000th Like! Now it says 1K <3
Incredible footage
This is a match made in Heaven
"That's quite a distance, like 4 or 5 inches"  Wish you'd tell that to my girlfriend.
Finally I've been waiting for this!!!
i like how dan slowly gets used to the pain and just bears with it  edit: for that full video on the 2nd channel, and i dont know much about youtube to know if it's possible or not, but why not upload it with 4x speed? then the viewers can watch it in 0.25 speed if they want to.
When I heard the bang I looked better and then I saw Mehdi. Explains everything.
13:50 what we’ve all been waiting for… for what feels like decades…
Now we can see ElectroBoom electrocute himself every 5 minutes in slow mo
dan is that guy who agrees to  do everything no matter how dangerous it is
YES
I can’t tell if Medhi is jealous or happy that someone else is getting hurt lol.
یارو بهش میخوره ایرانی باشه لهجه نداره انگار
Truly electrifying
The Mashup I didn't know I needed until now oh my god
Gavin and Dan need to switch roles one of these days
GOAT COLLAB
Finally the video which we we’re all waited for! 🎉
The 3 best people in one video
He he he...  Pink Panther.
Hi Brazil
earliest ive ever been here
yo
The video just started and I see Mehdi's Marx Generator on the table.  This gon be good...
This is THE crossover ever.
The fact they are socially awkward around each other proves that they truly are just nerds doing experiments alone… like it’s beautiful.
So that's Mehdi's normal speaking voice
I came here expecting explosions. Was not disappointed.
a collab i didnt know i needed
Love this collaboration, very glad to see some scientific pursuit.
Dang i thought i would see Mehdi get electroboomed in slow mo
This is the greatest colab of our time
I love how Medhi turns socially awkward as soon as he’s around people… he truly is the mega nerd.
Greatest crossover ever
I love electroBOOM!!  Can't wait to watch this colab!
Haha , the sudden shock that he gets while saying "oof" 😂
Ey thats Boom Guy
ElectroBoom and The Slow Mo Guys is the collaboration we didn’t realize we needed :D
This is the best crossover
Finally! I was waiting for this notification everyday! 🌟
Best
It is more impressive how both channels timed their uploads literally to the second…
OMG OMG OMG OMG  Two of my most favourite Youtube-Channels do a collab? Awesome !! Thank you sooo much for this one.
Fard
So good to see you two together on the reg again!!
First! Oh...
epic collab!
Slow-mo boom

Never been this early before
hi
Nice!
Tacos or burgers?
The team up we didn't know we needed
I will be the first one to finnish this video!
It wouldn’t be a Slow Mo Guys video if there wasn’t something dangerous happening.
Finally let's go
yes
ElectroBOOM nice!! I love the collab <3
Electicity and slowmotion? It should be cool!
