Aqui todo muy bonito, para Djokovic.Pero nadie dice nada de cuando le va mal un partido empieza a decir que esta lesionado o se marcha en el final del set dicendo que le tienen que atender los medicos etccc.
Considering his miserable start of the clay season this is miracolous.
GOAT!
The western media cannot overstate that in the aristocratic sport from the west, the best man is from eastern Europe. And from the Balkans. Overbearing, senseless and immature thinking mainstream media.
One is for sure, I will miss batles with Rafa, this is like a B movie vs movie classic...
Yessica laurich.💣
Playing against Novak on GS is hard work.He became HULK.
1:10 YES!?? Man it's like these Eurosport commentators are against Djokovic in every single match that he plays. Good that Djoker puts them to silence in most cases, just like on that historic day
The Best Player of the World.
A no vaxed Serbian Citizen Is the greatest tennis player. Big Pharma mafia and USA govern  will be not happy. GREAT NOVAK you are stronger than all this dirty subjects
RIP GOAT DEBATE!!!   DJOKOVIC = GOAT!!!
NESSUNO PUO BATTERE IL NUMERO 1 NOVAK!
I hated this man for defeating Roger at Wimbledon in 2019!!Now i just admire his mental resolve and hardwork!!GOAT undoubtedly!!I am sure he will win Wimbledon and US open this year!!No one can stop Djokovic!!
The power of pureblood
Great not to have to watch Nadal this year picking his shorts out of his arse and the rest of his annoying ticks
KING No1eeeeeeeeeee
Imagine telling someone unacquainted with tennis that the guy in orange is 36 years old, 12 years older than the other guy. Just insane. Dominating the tour like this in his 30s is completely unprecedented. Since Wimbledon 2018, his record vs t10 seeds in slams is 25-4. For comparison, Federer from Wimbledon 03- US 07 was 31-4. Difference being of course that Federer was young and fresh and simply too good for the older guys and his contemporaries, whereas Djokovic is beating up guys 10+ years younger than him regularly on every surface. He’s the best ever and I suspect it’ll be indisputable when he retires.
A man of principles, never bows down to media and social pressure and still the most GS ever for a long long long long time in the future.
GOAT
Djokovic fans are swimming in fedal fans tears after he won 23rd GS title 😂😂😂
Novak Djokovic is the greatest even with Covid Mafia
Руд лох как всегда в финалах слив. Новак ну величие среди всех и вся)))
ruud played amazing, still he was dominated. Djokovic is just too good
1:22 The best point from Djoko in the tournament
Top
The more the establishment pokes him, the more they try to boycott him, the more he is successful. On their posh courtyard, playing their own posh game. Right in the face of one of the most disgusting outrageous, dangerous humans, which is the scary president of the country that hosts the Rolland Garros
Most dominating player in tennis history is Pete Sampras. Nobody beat his record. He finished as #1,  6 years in the row. Federer only 4 years. Djokovic only 2 years. Sorry guys.))
Yes, congratulations are due and winning 23 Grand Slams is unique.  However, BBC TV is currently showing famous tennis rivalries.  Seeing Borg v McEnroe how much faster, more skilful and frankly interesting to watch the tennis was then, played with lighter racquets. faster courts and shorter shorts. By comparison this relentless  power driving can be tedious and it has turned tennis into a completely different game. Bring back serve and volley tennis, though it would need parallel tournaments, faster surfaces and lighter equipment.
what a player, what a player
REVENGE, HUGE KISS TO AUSTRALIAN OPEN AND ALL THE HATERS, JUSTICE IS DONE #1 A TRUE MAN
Novak GOAT!!! 🎾🏆🇷🇸 23
Novak equals Serena Williams in the number of slams, and is one short of Margaret Court and two away from absolute kingship.
23 + 7
1:24 GOAT point
N1 in and out of courts
Not letting that man play due to his vaccine status is simply a sign of deep deep fear of what he can do on the court and off the court. He deserves this victory more than anybody else. In the future everybody will praise this man for having courage in everything he does.
BATTLE???????????????????????????????? WHERE WAS THIS BATTLE? FOLKS, FOR YEARS YOU MOANED ABOUT FEDERER HAVING ZERO COMPETITION, THIS GUY IS PLAYING NO MARKS AND WIPING THE FLOOR WITH EVERYONE AT 36, RAM THAT IN YOUR PIPE AND SMOKE IT! I LOST INTEREST ALONG TIME AGO....." NEXT GEN" DO ME A FAVOUR! ANOTHER LOAD OF HYPE MADE UP BY A SNOWFLAKE!
Support to a man that stood up for himself and remined scam vax free. All round winner.
Incredible. Not my favourite personality, but my favourite player, really hope he can hit 25/26/27/28..!
Who wins the most is the best. Is it difficult to understand or admit? Who denies this is because they either hates the best or prefer a different player but preference is personal...
Seems like he's been chasing Fed and Nadal down forever...now he's caught and overtaken them.
Opet im se popiso svima😂
Ruud is better
Djokovic knows now Federer and Nadal are gone there are few players out there who can match him, if he stays fit 30 slams are possible.
7:13 Federer still has nightmares caused by that shot :)
Идемоооо брееее!!
I admire his perseverance. When he had to leave Australia during the Corona pandemic many thought it was over for him, and now he is uncatchably number one referring to the number of Grand Slams.
Djokovic ...  and theater...
semplicemente immenso grande nole
In third set Ruud take only 1 point on Novak serve.
The greatest man ever playing this sport, admit it or not. Those are just the facts.
If you’re looking for an edge in sports betting, AWAKENBEERUS is your secret weapon!!!
Ruud has nothing to do in a Grand Slam final
Para mi, cada victoria de Djokovic, es una victoria contra Bill Gates y el sistema podrido de la industria farmacéutica. ¿Desde cuándo se ha obligado a usar un experimento que jamás pasó los protocolos estandars de vacu-na? ¡Enhorabuena al campeón contra el Sistema Podrido por sobresueldos!
If this was Rafa or Roger it will all be all over in the New and all mead planforms. I remember when Rafa broke the record for 21 GrandSlams. They call him the GOAT immediately no debate about it. Now, they are say... Well, it is different time with different records. Different rackets technology and all that bullshit. Nole is The Goat no debate about it. Full Stop!!  They tried to stop him but, God is with him. He is destined to be GOAT for many millennium to come. Idemo Nole!!
Lance Armstrong…
I don't understand how mr Ruud made it to the final. Even that obnoxious person Tsitsipas is better than him.
Casper got ghosted today.
No one will ever surpass bjorn borg as the 🐐no mater the amount of grand slams the own.
Grande Dioko...il non vaccinato vince sempre.....ahahahahah...grandissimo uomo
No_vax Novak 💪 he didn't take the co.vid vaxxine so now he is super strong!! While for Nadal and Federer there is the retirement for health reason.....because the vaxxine???!!!!! 🤔
Novak Djokovic having all of the biggest records in tennis is poetic justice.  Despite being unfairly villainized, detained and deported, banned from many tournaments, and robbed of ranking points, he stood by his principles and refused to surrender.  He is the greatest male tennis of all time.
Novak , my great respect! Thanks for  pleasure you gave. You are great! Keep on winning. i wish you happinesses with your family!
Novaxx nocovid
Djokovic is the true GOAT. He had to play against Federer and Nadal, he had to play against Murray and Wawinka, Roddick, Hewitt and even Safin and he managed to win 23 slams. It's unbelievable. Roger has won the most of his titles before the era of Novak's and Nadal's dominance. For me Serb ist the GOAT, Nadal is 2nd and Roger 3rd, but I admire all of them a lot. I hope Iga dominates WTA tour like the big 3 in ATP.
Probably would have 25 already if the new world order didnt make an example of him about what happens if you dont follow the dogma
His level of play just rose and rose through the season and the tournament, until what we witnessed yesterday: simply unreachable (and by far) by Casper Ruud, wich is an excellent tennis player on clay himself. The level Novak showed in the final and how he basically incinerated Ruud is kinda embarassing for a slam final.  The only current competitor who can hope to give Novak a tough one is Alcaraz. But we saw how tension made him a bad trick in semi final. Carlitos is already great, probably best clay player in the world, but to get the crown from Novak's head we saw there's still some work to be done and experience to be made.
The great, Djokovic. One of the very greatest sportspersons, that ever lived.
The best tennis player in history without a doubt, only has one but he will never be the most loved.
GOAT
Great player, man of principles, family person, very smart, great sense of humor. I love watching him playing, but also enjoy listening to his interviews. Serbian nation can be proud of him. Greetings from Poland 😁
I'm not a Djokovic fan but I have to admit that the quality of play and level of fitness at the moment is superhuman 👏
If one of the other two had this record there would be no discussion.  RG and RN fanboys need to grow up and move on.  The debate is over.  Djokovic gifted 2017 and half of 2018 to them.  Stop talking about injuries and old Federer at 29.
Thank you
These youngsters cannot beat Nadal or Djokovic in their mid-thirties when they're in shape. A little depressing.....
Великий из Великих
Nole is simply the GOAT!
Amazing win & record :) As so many people are talking about the GOATs, don’t forget guys that Roger IS tennis 🎾
Aside from the outstanding shot quality, Djokovic's preparation looks exactly the same, no matter where he hits it to. He directs the ball at the last moment with a change of body rotation, which makes his shots so lethal. On the other hand, the others players shots are a lot more readable, especially for Djokovic. It is not all about hitting hard, power alone won't cut it at the top, if your opponent knows exactly where your shots are going all the time.
The fact that he had to Catch up to fedal and now keep destroying the new gen to break records is even more crazy. Saids alot
Was a huge Novak fan for years, but that stunt with his dad last year and the Ruskis has turned me off completely. Congrats to his 23rd. Great player, not so great attitude.
This guy has the greatest mental strength in the history of any sports
Король что сказать, победа заслуженная
Ruud is too nice of a guy to win something big
The goat. Unfairly treated and still rose above. A once in a generation talent. Respect to Ruud. But it was inevitable.
Novax serbian nationalist, congrats, but bad role model for this elegant sport. Where is his dad with 'Z' symbol, russia-supporters
The Serbinator!
🤮🤮🤮🤮
I said it before......final was played in semifinal.......Djoker has one true opponent and he defeated him in 2 nd set........the win goes to the most tenacious. Novak is the top deserved.
GOAT
The GOAT, and probably one of the best athletes in the world.
Statistics of the "Big Three" on "Helmets" at the beginning of 2011 (16, 9, 1) Now (20, 22, 23 )
Nole Is the alien!
If alcaraz or ruud had won,that could have been a big turn into history... But novak still beat the new bests players and will continue a bit more... Wimbledon is probably for him soon!!!
Bravo Upload.. Casper Well Played - Keep Going..  11 Slams in his 30's..  Oldest French Open Champion.. The Grand Slam is On..
Casper Ruud tam bir balon bana kalırsa.
Да женский финал поярче был а тут интрига была лишь в первом и в середине второго уже всё стало понятно...23 шлем все кричат,но ведь это не последний через месяц может быть а вернее скорей всего будет новый рекордный титул!))
He’s a robot this chap just something else his accomplishments are crazy
Un atleta incredibile che ha lavorato negli ultimi anni per raggiungere nuovi traguardi di sopportazione mentale e fisici. Più serio, più concreto, un po’ meno sorridente…ma terribilmente efficace. Nole è una macchina da guerra in campo inarrestabile. Congratulazioni
Великий игрок , великий человек , великий несгибаемый СЕРБ . Низкий поклон за игру , за характер .Ну, что , господа спортивные функционеры ? Обкакались?
I watched the game - it was total domination by Djokovic to the effect that it was not even interesting to watch. Djokovic vs Alcaraz was really worth watching.
It was never a match. You knew at the beginning Djokovic was fully focused on that 23rd grandslam. Like in the AO. He needed time to read Casper but after a few games the story was set and done. I feel it's going to be a long time we'll see epic long matches like years ago. Unfortunately.
Oh man.. i just thought that Noles other 22 slam´s were fluke wins but here he show that he is actually quite good.
Professor Emeritus Novak Djokovic !
Ruud did better this time against Novak than against Rafa. He deserves his second tray
If Djokovic plays like this, you have not any chances to win the match. Ahead  his favourite Wimbledon and US Open and  eventually everything maybe convert to 25th slames🥎
Next challenge for Casper: to play closer to the baseline, especially on grass & hardcourt.
NO VAX FOREVER. F..K Fauci, Australia, Pfizer, Soros, Gates
Made in Serbia
Nadal and Federer have special technique and skills. But Djokovic is actually a robot / mutant hybrid.
In terms of solo individual sports. He's up there with Floyd Mayweather in terms of elite GOATs.
Джокович молодец !
Novak Djokovic great champion !!
Victory belongs to unvaccinated😂
GOD MODE : ON    No1e  #1 !!!
Brilliant Novak👏👏👏
Yeah he's brilliant, probably the best ever but for sheer balletic genius Roger will always be the man. My total hero!
Congrats to the man who stood up in darkness and refused that criminal vaccine segregation. At some heavy costs.  Dignity and principles always pay off.  Here's the time to taste it.  Now THAT is true glory.   A true moment of satisfaction, even for people not giving a s***t about tennis
WEF minions crying while drinking copium right now 😏.
Nole finished the debate
Great Guy. One of the greatest Player of all time.
Seriously, if they don't find some way to get him from competing as has happened so many occasions like U$ Open, Au$stralian Open, I can not see another player capable of beating him on a Five set match, possibly Alcaraz but Djokovic still has a massive edge over him. He will reach 30 gran slams by the time he retires.
Im glad this tournament has ended so i dont have to watch john mcenroe doing that shit at the end if the highlights videos
G.O.A.T.
Bravo Nole!SRBIJA!🥲🤎🤎🤎
he was the best ever anyway, but that performance was just insane at 36 years old. GOAT
Truly the era of inflation, not only food and fuel prices, grand slam titles as well.
There we go again, always the GOAT discussion. Winning a (slam)title doesn't make you the GOAT.  I have immense respect for Djokovic. I think he is the most consistent tennis player I've ever seen, also in terms of fitness level (obviously you need a bit of luck with your body and genetics also). Was he the best player I've ever witnessed during my life time. No, sorry he simply was not.  But great respect and amazing athlete nevertheless.

Наш парень победил. Косово это Сербия
The quality and skills of Carlos Alcaraz is superior to this two players,  this was a very  poor game , Alcaraz would have beating  Djokovic easily  on this performance. Alcaraz injury  save Djokovic.
Congratulations to jokers cocktail amd nutritom team,clearly the best juice and fresh fruit for him in the whole sport!
Imagine if he didn't get deported banned disqualified, but doesn't matter now, either way he will get to 30.
All the Serbs gathered here but in vain,he is a very good player but not the best, Federer has developed, popularized and moved this sport forward.
I am really happy Djokovic won this final. Incredible tennis, incredible willpower, incredible man.
Now that’s a real weak era
Istinita istorija, ličnost koju će izučavati mnoge studije 💪🎾
The generations after the big 5 really have to wait until they retire.
Djokovic is beyond the mere tennis.
The unvaccinated champion.
Just fucking admit that he is the greatest of all time
👋👋👋
And he did without taking a shot. Clean red blood running through his vains.
NoVax, now you are official the GOAT
One more Wimbledon, he is equal with Federer in terms of Wimbledon championships.  He is really erasing Federer from all record boards.
Well done to novax, he deserves it entirerly
What a disappointing finale. Semi finale before Alcaraz got injured was alot better then this playground match.
Love and admiration to Djokovic. Thank you for today’s incredible playing!
The tennis Titan has struck again. If only the US open would let him compete, he would win all four slams. He is the real GOAT.
Россия болела за Новака!!!
У Джоковича отобрали 2 турнира большого шлема  .он вернулся должок и взял свой заслуженный 23титул .Поздравления из России !!!
he's got 5 more in him
Best tennis player ever! Imagine if he was welcome at any GS
Que poco rival ,este muchacho para la máquina de Novak
I'd say 27 G Slams he will finish on minimum.... Which is really like 29 or 30 (seeing as he missed these 3: USO20, AO22, USO22 )  Minimum:  Another 2 AO  Another 2 Wimbledons
2 minutes silence for the haters that counted him out vs Alcaraz a few days ago 😂😂😂
The progress Novak has done at the net is incredible.
Big congratulations for Novak Djoković.   He is not only the most successful male player in the history of grand slam tournaments. For me (and I am sure not only for me) he is also a great patriot, a great Serb, who always represented his country and nation with pride and dignity and his motherland has been for him always at the first place next to his family. The Serbian people can be proud of such compatriot like Novak Djoković.  Great respect from Poland. Cлава нашој браћи Србима!  🇵🇱🤝🇷🇸
23 gs győzelemmel is djokovic csak egy sokadik legjobb teniszező...🙈🙉🙊
NO VAXX DJOKOVIC  ✅💪🏻💪🏻
As someone who rarely watches tennis , watching nole every year atleast couple of games is just so fun, the guy is just so good at what he is doing, so strong, such an incredible athlete,so leathal, simply the best for me, i admire every game more in the last year cos i understand that the end of his career is getting closer.
Legend.
Has to be said this took a long while coming.Last year Novak was disappointed to lose to Nadal in quarters and this guy always goes an extra mile for slams. Ironic that Nadal won Novak's most favourite tournament last year due to Novak not being allowed to play in Australia and Novak has returned the spoils in Nadal's favourite tournament this year in his absence. These champions are hungry for titles one after the other whilst others wait for their turn.
who‘s the best tennis player in history? that‘s right .. he‘s from serbia
One Joker's Trophy down, one to go...
Incredibly dull commentator
Djokovic will get to 30 slams.
GOAT
GOAT of the GOATs
It's not normal what he's doing...
Could have been 24th
C O N G R A T U L A T I O N S
One of the greatest mental sport athlets of all time. if you think about how Novak has played in the last two tournaments and then this. Scary. I'm pretty sure the next title is waiting at Wimbledon, because he's been the absolute best player on grass in the last few years.
Ruud, much like Alcaraz rarely believed he could win that match. The second he lost the first set, he was little more than Djokovic's hitting partner. Djokovic once again showed, skills will get you so far, but Grand Slam tournaments are won and lost in the mind, and why he's won 23 of them.
ruud the perfect loser of finals slams ahah
The G.O.A.T ...federkohl    und nadal ..just nada..😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
👽
GOAT. No question anymore.
The one and only novak djokovic #thegoatdjokernolechamp23
Too good. Too easy. A 36 year old with a bad elbow wins in straight sets. Ruud and next gen are pathetic. Djokovic is amazing.
NOLE Genije !!!
Next Nikola Jokic NBA🇷🇸
woooow, bravo👏👏👏 just wow, tennis in its peak form.. woooow
Nole je srce Srbije.
Guys....let`s be realistic here....this was not bad at all...but peak Djokovic ist yet to come ;-) Give the man some time to get to his to his maximum level ^^
You can love some other player style more, but Novak is best to ever do it and thats a fact 💪💪🇷🇸🇷🇸🇷🇸🇷🇸🇷🇸
Djokovic is a man of focus commitment and sheer fu*kin will
Spielberg material,has all the elements, poor boy became a tennis god, different story then rich Roger or Rafa...but then i realised, as he is vilian in eyes of majority, better film would make Tarantino...
djokovic is the most complete player for sure and much respect for slam number 23 But there wasn't, isn't, and maybe won't be a talented player like roger.
The best ever tennis 🎾 player of all time congratulations 🎊 novak
In a press conference before the match, Ruud said he will try to go out and play relaxed...what a dumb mindset, against the GOAT you must enter the arena with a killer instinct...Alcaraz said before the match that to be the best you have to beat the best....that attitude will oneday beat Djokovic...Ruud made the same mindset mistake as with Nadal...dumb norwegian 🤣
Trop fort
Mozete da ga mrzite zato sto je Srbin,ali mu mozete i p....... k... jer ako postoji neko ko je dotakao nebo u sportu to je Nole a odma posle su Jokic i Jordan.
Jednostavno najbolji svih vremena!!! Živ i zdrav nam bio!!!
What a petsokoma!🤘Goatovic
What should have been No. 25
The man who rewrote the history of tennis is the great and unsurpassed Novak Djokovic 🇷🇸
The greatest Player ever the goat
SERBINATOR THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME 🐐
Опять величайший  Джокович  стал  играть  на  голову  выше  всех    , это  впечатляет
Since today Novak Djokovic is GOAT. I love Roger Federer, the most elegance and complete player. And i love Rafa Nadal. And Djokovic is a fighter. He never give up. He is the best. Since today Djokovic is No 1 ever 👏👏👏
ЧЕЛОВЕЧИЩЕ!!!!
Why watching "Roland Garros Channel's" highlights if you have this available? Thanks @eurosport
Just shows the embarrassment of other players, even when djokovic gets to 60 he'll still be beating everyone 😂
No doubs ... GOAT !!!!!!!!!
Nevermind the greatest tennis player - we seriously need to consider if he's the greatest overall sportsman of his generation. He's THAT great.
People say it was easy for Federer to win grand slam tournaments since he faced players like Baghdatis in the finals, but wasn't Baghdatis better than Ruud?
💉🚫🃏🐐🎾🫡🔥💯
4:30 - the commentator's pleasure.. satisfaction there. :)
A winner on and off the court.
I don't like him, but he's absolutely the best ever.
Ruud dressing upsets my stomach
The old goat is dead! LONG LIVE THE GOAT!!!!
So weak Casper Clown.
36 years old..what a champion..
Is the debate over?? Yes, definitely is!
The goat
Djokovic is GOAT
Novak has 5 winning streaks at Grand Slams of 20 or more matches in a row, absolute record. (The second best is Roger with 3 streaks)  All Djokovic streaks so far: 2015-2016 - 30 matches 2011-2012 - 27 2021 - 27 2018-2019 - 26 2022-2023 - 21 (ongoing)  Viva Nole!
7:57 I count 5 double steps by Djokovic to set up that forehand. The man's form is a model for all aspiring contenders
Король тенниса
‘HI I’M JOHN MCENROE’…   Please get rid of this ad after your videos. The highlights are good, but the ad gets pretty annoying.
Once he raised the RG Cup, crowd was pretty quite... not so much delight you could hear, except few claps... no one likes him, simply because he is of slavic origin... same you could felt when Lendl was on top... they simply do not like when poor slavs mess with their idealistic and reach western sociaties...  Nole, keep pushing... fuck them all...
The young guns all look great on paper but none of them have the mental toughness yet to stay with one of the old guard when they are fit and really want it.  Both Ruud and Alcaraz could only show flashes of what they can really do, before wilting under the pressure.
Wht an amazing performance
What comes next? Wimbledon of course.
He deserved it!
This was very weak from Ruud. No ideas, no match plan, and without it you can't beat Novak. Often to short with his balls, and then you are a pretty easy prey for Novak. Djoker can smell the fear of his opponents.
Hehehehe💪💪💪💪
When Alcaraz got injured, Djokovic secured the title. Alcaraz was the only one who could take Djokovic. Ruud play style is heaven for him. Alcaraz was intoxicating Djo with unexpected dropshots and returns. Ruud can be much eaiser anticipted in compare to Alcaraz. So, lucky Djokovic and surely a well earned success. Congrats.
Poslednji Imperator. Last Imperior.
The fact that he is better than Fedal was as clear as daylight even before this win, now the true question is how far he can get. This is where the GOAT starts to push the boundaries of what is possible in the sport and he is going where no one has gone before. Theory says he can win Wimbledon and US Open, I hope he can do it.
док се као младић борбено пробијао до врха, скратио ми је живот и нервирао, али и обрадовао на сузе. Када је завладао тереном, све претходно - али у мањој мери. Када сам се бринуо за њега, а то је у последњих 5.год ЂолеНоле и даље гура. Лепо је у животу радити оно што волиш. Ђоковић се изборио за то. sve ovo prevedeno na engleski : GOAT
Would win Wimbledon as well
Rudd has a similar style of play as Djokovic, the problem is you cant beat Djokovic using his game style.
How the fuck did he win 😅
How weak is Ruud...a good player, but not a powerful mind...a shame😢
He never played the nicest tenis, he is not a magician like Federer or a dust warrior like Nadal, but in era of those 2 players (greatest ever) he proved to be even better. An amazing sportsman 👏👏👏 In the end, win or lose, he is on of the sincere players, always shake hands with a smile.  In the game and zone, he is a ruthless tennis machine 💣
NOVAX IS WIN FOR ALL PEOPLE ON WORLD WITH BRAIN....
We all know, the semi with Alcaraz was the real final.
Messi = football god ⚽ Brady = handegg god 🏈 Novak = tennis god 🎾
Free Kosovo 🇦🇱🇦🇱🇦🇱
Поначалу удивил, но за ум взялся и побил рекорд по большакам. Молодчага! Сербам привет. Победил наш.
If Djokovic gives you a chance to play against him on last stages of GS - it is a FINAL trap because he has already extremely enhanced his level.
The moment Alacaraz body gave up Djokovic won the RG.
GOAT.
Greatest athlete of all time…
Backhand Slice from Ruud was very lucky for Djokovic. He always had enough time to prepare for the blow.
Jedini i neponovljivi Nole!Svaka čast.
Mind, Heart and Legs 🐺💪🎾
Bs
A 36 ANNI E SENZA VACCINO COVID .... ABBIAMO CAPITO TUTTO NO ? BRAVO NOVAK 🎾🥇💪😄
ma non doveva essere morto?
Novak is "The Superlative."
Like i have been saying for years… Djokovic is INEVITABLE. They threw everything at him: some of the greatest players of all time, the biased media, banning him from competing, the hostile crowds, even biased governments using him as a scapegoat… NOTHING WORKED. Anyone even remotely thinking of debating his GOAT status has to be nothing but a sore loser. Djokovic has won 15 out of the last 18 slam finals he has competed in… let that sink in for a moment…  UNDISPUTED GOAT in every way and i would argue the greatest living athlete regardless of sport at this very moment.
🇷🇸🇷🇸🇷🇸☦️☦️☦️🗡️🗡️🗡️
Thank you Novak!
OVAKO SAMO IGRAJU   SRPSKI JUNACI
Best Player ever .   The Corona Mafia die loss
SIMPLY THE BEST
Ноле лучший и величайший🇷🇸💪🥴
For a guy with "niggles" he didn't half play well !! Took it up another notch today... Just too good. 23 slams- Incredible... and prob' would be more were it not for you know what...
Supergoat.
The pinnacle of he's career? For real? It is the pinnacle of the sport you get your salary from. It is the historic moment in every sense, and all you can say is the pinnacle of he's career? Appalling! Shame on you. Shame on Eurosport! Utterly shameful and bemusing.
Left his be(a)st tennis for finals! Just a legend!!
The greatest tennis machine EVER 👍🇬🇧
IS THERE NO ONE, IS THERE NO ONE,
My man, he is just the greatest like Messi.
A great performance by Novak. Casper Rudd did well to take it to tiebreak in the first set.
He’s going to win 25*
Okay, now that we know who the GOAT is, we can start debating who is the second best Nadal or Fed.
Pure Blood for the Win
GOAT by far 😂
🃏💪🧠🎾🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆...🤫
Today history was written in tennis. Djokovic has proven he is the biggest and this is mainly through his mental power. I will think about his difficult moments when I need support and he will help me. Thank you Nole for your personality. You are the last one of "three big" and you are the biggest.
Как ни старались англосаксы, но ничего у них не получилось.
Sometimes you get justice even in this world. Djokovic did not just deserve it, he earned it. Great man, great player.
I am fun roger federer but GOAT is NOLE.
Der beste Spieler aller Zeiten! Diesen Titel kann ihm niemand absprechen, nicht mal die Amerikaner, Engländer und Australier, die sich vor Scham verkriechen sollten...
GOAT
A man of honour and principles.   We all know this should be at least slam 25 by now.   Nole is the GOAT despite those who try to stop him.   Respect 💪
Джокович если так будет играть то догонит рафу по трофеям
0 unforced errors in tie breaks in this tournament.. Sometimes I think, and I think it's really like that, that he plays with 50-60% and usually that's enough for a set.. And if it's not enough, he just turn on  monstrous mood 90  -100% in tie break and that's it.  No one will ever reach this tennis perfection, I won't say it's impossible, but it's very, very difficult.. 23 and it doesn't seem like it's going to stop, let's be real, there's still no living being who can get him to the grand slam.  Lets go wimbledon!
those line returns are crazy
...e non era vaccinato!!!
When Djokovic gives you the first 3 games, don't take it, it's a trap. He'll win the set and then the match
What a shame for Alcaraz, Ruud and current men's tour😢
Ruud looked so amateurish in the second half of the match. Lol
History in the making.
G.O.A.T
When Serbs go hard they change the game & history! Idemo🇷🇸
He is unstoppable, there will be 24 Grand Slam title...and so....they can hate him and whistle as much as they want, but he has already written tennis history, there is no better one and that is a fact!!! Let's go Nole further YOU (WE) ARE THE CHAMPIONS🎾 🔴💙⚪🔴⚪🔴⚪🔴IDEMOOOOO
O how karma works , 2022 AO Nadal overtakes Nole in the slam battle, in Nole’s backyard and absence saying that ,,Rules are rules” and in 2023  RG Nole overtakes Nadal in his backyard and in his absence saying that ,,it’s a big loos for the tournament “ that Nadal isn’t able to play !!!!!
Idemo! 💪
Unvaxxed and the best!! 😁😁😁
Karma 😊
Se ha quedado solo
👏👏👏
Viva las Macedonia The Great Master of Tennis Novak Djokovic is number 1🏅♥
The Law of Karma has done its work. He couldn't play in Australia and Rafa reached the 22 GS in Novak's garden. Now Rafa can't play and Novak reached the 23 GS in Rafa's garden !!!. Congratulations Champion,  you are simply the best !!!
Journalists weren't happy about Djokovic winning!!!😂😂
There is no more fitting quote for Nole than "Victory belongs to the most tenacious". After over a decade of waiting, he has finally achieved his dream and become a record champion. Records come and go, but Novak's legacy will remain for eternity. Despite the resistance of the media and the embarrassing crowd that always tried to bring him down, he managed to persevere and break through the phalanx of Roger and Rafa. These obstacles have made him a legend. Thank you for being an inspiration!
Красавчик! Но Алькараса всё таки жалко.)
Félicitations à Casper, mais aujourd'hui Djokovic a repris à RG, le titre qu'on lui avait volé à Melbourne,  sur les terres du vainqueur d'alors.  La loi du Karma a  parlé. 😊
Great victory for Djokovic. Ruud needs to improve his sliced backhand. These highlights showed that they are too short and not distinctive enough to function as a defensive tool. Ruud should get angry, and improve to get revenge at the US Open.
Well now when Nole is a GOAT we can add up Roger 20 and Nadal 22 slams so thats about 65 slams in previous ~18 years which means they all took almost everything. The reign of the Big Three is now full circle. Legendary feat of that generation.
Even as a Federer fan and also a huge admirer of Rafa Nadal, I have to say Novak Djokovic is the greatest. Give this great champion the respect and the priaise he fully deserves.....and to keep doing this at the age of 36 is just mind blowing.
The match was over as soon as it went 6-6 in the first
Mental strength, accuracy of shots, endurance, perfection, beautiful game and beautiful shots are what Djokovic possesses 23...is here..24.....soon....
Still prefer to watch videos of RF and Rafa
King 👑 Novak
Oggi Novak ha giocato come nn lo faceva da tempo.complimenti
Anyone who knows tennis already knew that Djokovic is the GOAT. This just makes the obvious all the more concrete. Where's the deluded Fedal fans now...
The haters must be FURIOUS 😂😂😂
Ha ganado con justicia. Es el mejor. El noruego muy bueno, y me parece un caballero.
Djokovic is THE GOAT in sports history. There has never been in the history of sports in any sport that the 3 GOATs play in one generation. AND Djokovic prevailed..........:::::::::::::.........................
GOAT debate is over
Such a domination.....Crazy
He's not been jabbed, shouldn't he be dead by now?
This middle generation of players are tragic man, getting played off the court by a 20 year old who still has acne and  100 year old nadal and djokovic
The Debate is over.
Imagine if there has been no Roger and no Rafa. He would have won at least 50 grand slams by now. Incredible player.
A truly sad day for Eurosport.
Haters on life support right now!!! C'mon haters where ya at now? Yeah, it ya hearts out, it's gonna be a sleepless night tonight and for the rest of the year as the #SerbianGladiatorIsAtItAgain taking legs and souls (as Roddick would say) #23GrandSlamsAndCounting simply #TheBestPlayerThatEverLived #NovakDjokovic
this guy is unbelieveable and probably the best tennis player that ever lived, but holy fck this annoying fan cult around him is disgusting. always the same comments, as they have nothing else in their life
So that's what Djokovic improved: he introduced a flat killer-forehand that he's alternating randomly with his top-spin forehand. Hitting the ball flat increases risk for error, but the shot can be so much harder and faster. I trust this new weapon will bring him back to ATP no. 1. Yep, top-spinners: time to learn hit the ball flat. 😀
Iron Serb 💁🏼‍♀️ Djoker ♥️🙌🏻
Novak is the king with huge tools !!no one can beat a big one
Massive congratulations sir
haters in ruins. i love it 🤣
You envious and haters, bow deeply and as far as possible to the G.O.A.T 🇷🇸Djoković
23 GRAND SLAMS - the discussions who the GOAT is, are finaly over - its NOLE ❤️ p.s. dear haters, i hope you gonna sleep well tonight 😉 idemoooo 🇷🇸
The question about the greatest of all time was answered by Nole Goatkovic ... next challenge of the question 20 years later (at least)
He would've had the Grand Slam record at AO2022 but corruption stopped him. This was a year and a half in the making. No one deserves this success more than Novak Djokovic. A great player and a great man.
GOAT
GOAT
Hate him or love him, but Djokovic is undoubted the best tennis played that has ever lived on this planet
Железный Серб! С победой ! Молоток!
