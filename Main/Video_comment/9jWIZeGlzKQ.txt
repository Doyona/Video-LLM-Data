Jaron has a habit of hitting people behind the head, it might be intentional, saw two fights where Jaron hit the boxer with the same punch behind the head
First punch looks illegal … behind the head an I think the fight was over from their
Ortiz Jr will beat boots
I think everybody is ducking this guy!
Those shots behind the head will mess you up.
He is a Killer ❗️
Still not ready for T-Bud 😅
Dulorhme is a old washed up fighter wat y’all excpect to happen ennis still hasn’t fought anyone in my eyes
I like the way this ref counts.
I'm sorry, so shots to the back of the head are legal now?
Boots thank you for helping Julio Cruz from Cuba. I'm from Cuba thank you my brother I appreciate it. You really are good people
Illegal punches behind the head is his skill?
Boots is a beast but he gets hit way to easy. That dude only threw 2 punches after the first knockdown and he landed both punches. That's ridiculous. Boots has a good chin and why he doesn't care but u can't be the best if u lack in defense remember that.
I love some EJ, but I think Boots beats him and Bud.
Ilegal punch
Boots explosiveness and athleticism reminds me so much of Roy jones pretty soon he’ll run boxing
He's Not Gonna have A Real Good fight Til he Move up to like #160
That punch was borderline. Reminds me of the shots that Maidana and Andy Ruiz are infamous for. Another millimeter and it's definitely back of the head.
Boots is deadly and he's walking through everyone their able to get. Up coming fighter who's skilled and dedicated isn't a smart business move for opposition, especially for the household 147lbers.
Spence and Bud don't Never, Ever Disrespect this Man At All !!!!!! They know the Probability, Success Rate of Beating this Man Slim as hell I Guarantee Spence Drop the Belt before fighting Boots lol If Spence lose he know his Career, Status, Big Pay days Are Seriously Gone
Where Mikey Garcia at ?????? That Would Cement jarron Career, Establishment, And Contender for Any fucckin body in the top 4 Period This Man is Definitely A Boogey Man for Welter Weights
He finishes him off Way faster than Crawford lol Give this Philadelphia killer his Shot at the Title Nowwwww!!
A Walking NightMare Smh Nobody Wants the Smoke, Nobody
1 MILLION!
My new idol  jaron "boots" ennis,💪soar higher!!!
Crawford and errol in trouble
Ennis has a god chin… unfazed by that. Barely affected by a massive hook from lipinets as well
I wan to see Boots fights a real fighter . This dude shouldn’t have been in there .
Geez, Ennis is quick and he punches HARD.  That first knock down was behind the ear though, but it would have been highly doubtful Dulorme would have survived more than a few more rounds even if he hadn't been knocked down then.  It's understandable why some of the other welterweights are not eager to fight him, hoping maybe he will move up a weight class.
Ennis seeks and destroys
He is gotta deal with Crawford, Spence and Ortiz Jr.
All the fighters that went 6-12 round with Crawford and them Ennis scorched in seconds. He will be a problem for anyone point blank. By the time he’s fighting bud and then he will beat them he’s simply too fast has the natural talent maybe more than them, and he will be as or more technically sound as ANYONE he faces add the fact he is light years faster than any elite welter he will ruin anyones night mark my words
So dirty
That over hand right was behind the ear aka behind the head!
"If that was Tyson Fury on the ground the ref would count like, 1 (wait ten minutes), 2 (wait ten minutes), 3 et cetera, and all of 'you' guys would defend it by saying it's a 10 count not 10 seconds. Imagine the shenanigans if the shot clock in the NBA was just the referees counting to 24. You don't have to imagine the shenanigans in boxing, it's Tyson Fury laying on the ground for way too long and still being allowed to continue.".
What's wild about the power of Boots is that he'll drop you with the right hand from the conventional stance only to then knock you out with the left from the southpaw position.  Unreal power in both hands.
Ennis has been hitting the last two guys behind the head . Dirty af
His over hand right is the same one he clipped Clayton with. Kinda dirty I my opinion
Clipped behind the head then gets the ko
it wasnt impressive , it wasnt a clean punch to the jaw ..
Bro… don’t announced I’ve been knocked down for the 9th time
Wowwwww!!! He knocked him down with the right & left hand in opposite stances
Seems like he INTENTIONALLY goes for the Back of the Head...
Ennis fights very well with both hands in either left or right stance. Who else can do that in his division? Bud and he fights better as a south paw. Ennis WILL BE a major problem for Bud and Spence.
man he be hitting in the back of the head
Crawford and Spence better move up or down. This dude is going to be a problem.
That first KD he was definitely targeting the back of the head, that seems to be his favorite punch.   Referees need to take notice, that is a very dangerous punch
What a monster who the fuck beats him lol
Ennis is great at that overhand behind the head I’m noticing.
That punch was on the back of the head
Ennis Vs.  Spence!
the first fall was a totally illegal hit
Ennis ate two overhand rights at the end
Best fighter in the game just my meek and humble opinion
No way he could recover from that punch on the ear that covered a good portion behind it.
Just for the record he purposely took that shot to get on the inside , No Power in those punches against boots
While this performance is impressive he needs to calm down with chasing the finish, Got caught with two big punches which wouldn’t have happened if he picked his shots better, That will come with experience, Still only 24 years old, There’s a bright future ahead that’s for sure
Canelo rather retire than tak on this dude
In like 5 or 6 years Shakur vs Boots will be the biggest fight in boxing
Keith Thurman make it happen
Jaron Ennis Boots is the truth
They was trying to say it was a illegal punch lol 🤦🏾‍♂️
Boot got caught flush on the chin. Getting caught in the exchanges is how Boots will catch that firs L unless he wises up and learns. A better fight will punish him for going in an out with his head straight up like that
Behind the head shot ......my man just couldn't get back balanced.
From UK big up  Jaron Ennis
Spence & Crawford want no smoke!!!!!!!
Broda is silently violent  Very nice 👌🏿 Cheers from west Africa  🦅
When is Ennis going to fight a 50/50?
Ortiz hurts Ennis
Get this man a title fight already.
tell them to sign the contract or vacant the belts
Boots walked into a right hand tho.. he stumbled a bit for a second.. can't do that champ against Spence or Crawford.. you going to sleep 💤 😴
Speed is key in any sport he has it and it looks like power but the speed shocks the equilibrium Power puts u to sleep 💤 buts he a good talent. Some flaws though…
He goes down for the 9th time..lol  then quoted kanye..no one man should have all that power
It went behind the head cause of him ducking, not intentionally but that's what really did Delorme in
One thing I notice about Ennis and Bud as switch hitters, their defense declines in the southpaw stance
Spence dogs out Ennis
Smh everything we see a good referee count etc. just shows more and more that the cheated for Tyson the cheat Fury smh
On the to be the new Terrence ! But I'm not following !
He has to stop with that leaping left hook or somebody with better timing and power will clip him
Yea that 1st ko was behind the head
I think Jaron's next opponent is Keith Thurman
Ilegal Punch wow
Everyone talking about boots dude stay fighting  bums wait till he fight a elite fighter 😂
Ahora de hace más regueton en la isla que boxeo, por eso están en decadencia boxistica
he ain't fighting no 147lbs fighters, all his fights is 140lbs, they all look good until they get hit in their face
That three piece was so clean
When a boxer been knocked down to many times their just not the same anymore so I wouldn’t give boots all the credit since he’s not the same fighter getting knocked down to many times
as we have seen previously with boxers like Crawford Gary Russell Devin Haney and a host of others i hope the politics of boxing are destroyed so the best fighters can ascend to the top and the sanction bodies stop helping others who dont deserve those opportunities based on favoritism race etc. like creating Franchise Belts The WWE does not even produce those placing certain fighters at the top of rankings when they havent fought competition to be in those spots allowing and increasing doping levels for fighters that maybe using illegal enhancers also letting them still fight while failing those test keeping theyre titles and lastly robbing fighters out of clear victories
1:59 Terence Fucking Crawford lmfaooo but I like how they're building this kid up. He's truly special.
Browns Mexicans and native Americans 12 tribes of Israel we are God chosen people the real Hebrew Israelites of the earth we are the real Jews repent
You can tell VERY EASILY when a guy doesn't want to get back up and makes a half assed attempt.  That 2nd one was that.  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Absolutely beautiful combo
Boots is the next big star in boxing. Philly kid he different plus he comes from a boxing family.
down goes Giannis Antetokounmpo
Vergil Ortiz going against Ennis will be Massive."!!! Winner 🏆 gets the Top Dawgs
Porter running his mouth like he won’t get retired twice in the same calendar
His facing bums. He can't do that to Crawford . Spence. Vergil. Ugas list of champs goes on.
He looks really good against a Spanish Harlem Uber driver Spence will love this fight he stop 🛑 him quickly if chooses to go toe 2 toe
He still ran into shots as he came in with his own. Do that with bud and it's allllllllllll over.
this dont matter, Everytime they are on PPV they never wanna throw hands, That goes for every boxer in 2010-now.
Ennis was hurt by that right hook from Dulorme before Ennis finished him off.
Keith Thurman need to take this fight and stop ducking
It was an illegal shot behind the head, but the guy did duck and that's how he got hit there. Ennis is a really good talent, and I've said it once and I'll say it again. The kid takes too much damage, yes....he has power, speed and quickness and a lot of youth on his side. But if he doesn't clean up his defensive skills these top guys are gonna wipe him. Simple as that
Philly Pa. Boots is a Bad Ass. Insane Power in both hands. Look how he sits down on every shot.
Boots is pound for pound, I told people this a year ago, and he has the body to move up to get Canelo,Charlo and David Benavedez., Boots is next trust what I say here.
I think Boots at 148 & Tsyzu at 154 want all the smoke out there.They both look like they can lift another level every time they fight.They will clean out them divisions.No-one running nowhere.If 1 don't get you the other will.They will be superstars in the next 2 yrs.They coming into their prime.They both been doing it since they can walk.
All the top boxers in the welterweight are streetfighters what they’re doing is not boxing it’s self-defense with the fist
OK OK ,NOW I CAN SEE THIS GUY IS A MONSTER !INNIS LOOKS BETTER THAN CRAWFORD,SPENCE,CANELO ANDDD IF HE DECIDED TO GO DOWN IN WEIGHT >>>>BETTER THAN TANK,HANEY,SHAKUR OR ANY OF THE OTHER BOXERS IN RECENT HISTORY !>>>>>>HEY "CHARLO BROTHERS">>>>>>>>>>>>>>>laughing my ass off /SERIOUSLY ,I THINK WE FINALLY   MAY HAVE FOUND A TRUE BOXER>>>>>>>I MEAN E N O U G H  WITH" ""A  L  L "" "OF THESE BOXERS AFRAID TO FIGHT ONE ANOTHER!! DUCKING MF(s)
Next for crawford
devin haney vs jaron ennis
He get hit way too much. Better get that defense up if he wanna fight the elites
He gonna be the man one day
1 round is crazy lmfao
He threw the fight, that punch wasn't that hard..took the money and fell down 👎
Ennis is on a different level can’t wait for the step up in competition
That Kanye Quote >
Jaron ennis needs to get tested
esta pelrea fue ganada por un golpe ilegal en la nuca  lastima que nadie se dio cuenta
That punch to the back of the head started the downfall.
That shit was pretty ☝️💪
Nobody seems to want that Smoke from Boots?!!
The truth
back of the head
I still think Crawford beats him
Not amused.... Dulorme is a shell of himself and he is a 135/140 contender....not even a world champion. Crawford stopped him years ago in his prime years as a 135 lb contender.....since then Dulorme has lost 5 of his 8 bouts and he's struggling to make weight at 140 so he was forced to move up to a division in which he has no ability to compete......  If Boots wants to impress those that matter (the boxing sanctioning committees, he needs to fight a ranked division opponent. Or at least a legit welterweight.......Dulorme & Lipinets are his best wins to date.....no wonder why he looks great in the ring.....Nobody he's faced will ever come close to a welterweight world title.........but y'all claiming he is better than Crawford/Spence/Ugas/etc........Mfers don't even follow the sport. Y'all just love a man who participates in the sport.
Behind the head is right.
That straight left was beautiful. 🔥🔥🔥
This man is SACRY GOOD
Will be a goat soon
The first knock out was behind the ear, that's illegal
If he open that way against any of the top guys he gets slept tbh bud doesn’t let him swing wild and off balance and get away with it just saying
Jaron need step up the level of competition.  No more bums
Dulorme is not the same fighter when he fought Bud.
1:39 : " Never Trust A Man With No Mustache " 🤣😂🤣😂 💨💨💨💨
Enis is good and sharp but remember ppl always look against basic fighters I mean that’s that guys 9 lost my ko Gtfoh ppl believe the hype too much I’ll believe against top opposition
Ortiz and Ennis are the two best up and comers. Neither of them should get a title shot until they fight and figure out who the real best young challenger is and deserves it.
Boots!! Going to be a future champion no doubt about it!!
Ennis vs Spence would be interesting
At 0:37, it would have been nice to see how Dulorme's right would have affected Ennis had it connected with the tip of his chin.  If Ennis can walk through "that" punch, then I'd say he's a force to be reckoned with.  Boxers who can take a punch to give a better punch are more exciting to watch...but have a shorter shelf life.
HE WOULD DESTROY ORTIZ
lm surprised he has not had a title shot yet! 28 and 0 give him his shot!
Boots is definitely special!
Waiting for him to KO Spence
That first punch was behind the head.
how would he do against Connor Benn ???
Behind the ear boarder
Strong ass jab
jaron should fight someone good already hes 28-0 and hes fought 0 high level guys. Love the way he fights so i think its about time he gets a fight against someone good
Boots left hook just like pretty boy Floyd 🥊
I wanna see Boots fight Vergil Ortiz or Keith Thurman next
He has no power compared to Ortiz. He has speed and some power. But Otiz is a monster  I'd love to see them fight
I'm not joking about this either if Canelo came to 154 and met Ennis he would do the same thing in the same round to Canello Alvarez."
Geez dude a problem
1 Corinthians 11:13 “Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?”  King James Version (KJV
He should get a shot at top welterweight. Or give him to virgil ortiz.
Thomas dulorme is barely a decent contender.
Y’all understand that boots had him out on his feet with a fucking straight!
He quoted a scene from Malcom X 😂 “Not one man should have all that power”
Ennis is going no where; when that puppy gets handled by a real welter, he’s gonna sleep; beating a journey man is nothing. Let him fight Vergil Ortiz Jr.
Hell of a fighter
That was a rabbit punch 100%
Back of the head like shit…
Boots is coming!
Tremendous speed! The only thing that could beat this is someone with better timing.
BodyBlow Fighters newest way to live and fight .....matches fights will be uploaded in 3months https://youtu.be/1MkeC-pe6zU https://youtube.com/shorts/UHF9oGcroFc?feature=share   Be the first to get a interview with the company if your looking for platform traffic based off what will or might be...
This kids guna be an issue man. Very impressive
First punch behind the head it was over after that.
Why can’t he fight Crawford in February?
First left hand was fast as lighting.
That straight left made Dude look like a ghost, I no I saw a spirit leave that man body….
Just stay down. Dont pretend like your stumbling  Its pathetic   More respectful to accept defeat and take the knee
2:05 after that combo, my mans Boots face said “Damn Boul 🥴😮‍💨” 😂😂
Wasn’t all his fault though
Obviously a very skilled fighter.. but hit dude in the back of the head lol
Easy to look good against tomato cans. Waiting on him to actually fight someone
He got some pop in his punch, but that 1st punch close to being illegal.
That right hand was pretty legal though...
I've also noticed that Ennis doesnt bother much about defence, esp with his gloves, its eighter he defends himself by head movement or he trusts his chin and takes the punch and move foward.🤣
I think Ennis is the next P4P. I see him KO'ing crawford.
Royjones 3rd
Easy work p4p king of 147/154 Smoke season 👀👀 who want the smoke!!
Glass jaw boot Ennis.
Boots a prollem! Lol
Rabbit punch
Boots don't ever disappoint, the accuracy of shortening that right hand to hit that moving target (head in motion)was sick. This man going to the top. He possess it all. Power both hands, can box, brawl, switch hitter, got grit, etc... Bad dude💪🏽✊🏽 keep doing what you do champ!
illegal punch... thomas contested it, we'll see what happens next. boots fanboys need to stop celebrating
Nice k.o behind the head
that was a rabbit punch knock out wtf
ilegal second punch 1:24 right behind the ear.
Dudes fast. Boots vs ugas. Then Crawford and Spence have no excuses
He's similar to bud Crawford . Able  switch stance . But can he have the similar success like Crawford . Mayb cinch Crawford hahahah
Lunging Left into overhand right, then a mean 3 piece sheeeeeee
Commentator low-key shout out kanye
God doesn’t want anybody in hell because He loves us, but you must understand why we deserve hell and why those who refuse to live under His authority will go there. He gave us the law (Ten Commandments) not to make us righteous, but rather to show us our sin (Romans 3:20). We’re not sinners because we sin, but rather we sin because we’re sinners. Sin is the nature of our flesh that we are born with due to the sin of Adam in the garden. For someone to be justified before God they have to be sinless. We’ve all sinned (Romans 3:23), and the the law demands death for those who sin (Romans 6:23). God is righteous, so He must punish our sin, which is what He did through His Son Jesus Christ on the cross. Jesus is Holy and sinless, yet He received our sin when He died on the cross, so that we can be righteous before God (2 Corinthians 5:21). When He died on the cross, He said “It is finished” (John 19:30), which means He paid the full price for all of your sins (past, present, and future) to be forgiven. He was buried and rose again from the dead. God will forgive anybody who puts their full trust in Jesus Christ alone for salvation. We aren’t saved based on our good deeds, but only by the grace of God (Ephesians 2:8-9). His precious blood that He shed is the only reason why we can be forgiven of our sins (Hebrews 9:22). If you confess that Jesus is Lord and believe that God raised Him from the dead, then you’ll be saved (Romans 10:9). You are born-again with the Spirit of Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17), and are not only legally justified before God, but also are accredited His righteous (Romans 4:24). Believers live for Christ now, so get to know Him through His Word. I recommend reading the book of Romans and the gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John), and watching Pastor Joseph Prince’s online sermon!
Even after he had Dulorme hurt he didn't just start swinging for the fences. His guard was still tight and he picked his shots. Boots is a monster. Future hall of famer right here.
Future of the division 💯
He doesn’t beat Spence or Crawford in my opinion
That was a rabbit punch man..
"Boots" Ennis has the youth, but Errol "The Truth" Spence Jr. has the knowledge, wisdom, and experience in the ring as unified Champion. The Truth's traits outweigh Ennis' hunger and youth.
Kid has a horrible chin Crawford stole his future. I’m surprised he’s still getting fights
Rabbit punch
Wow INSANE!.....these titles lol
Holy s###
I like Ennis now I would like to see him in there with a Ugas Garcia Thurman to see if he's it at 147
Ennis is ready for the big names of division.
Damn, that was behind the head!
Ennis vrs Broner make it happen , don't play with us give Ennis that problem!! 🔥🔥
He should fight Ugas
Oh please thomas has been stopped 2 prior times hes not even a top ten fightter
@1:43 that three piece with sauce was beautiful stood homie str8 up
Ennis is good - just like soccer if you can play with left and right ... you're good
Ennis hit the guy behind his head, that jolt would put anybody down, and the fact that this man has been down 8 times prior 6 loses and knocked out twice means he was just cannon fodder, this ain't a fight you call out Crawford, Thurman or Spence after. Everybody wants Spence until he starts working the body. Boots you asked for it, I hope you get it!
232 wooo
WTF are these commentators watching, that was not a legal punch, but the question is was it intentionally or unintentionally thrown to the back of his head. Definitely unintentional, ref should have given Delorme the benefit of the doubt by giving him time to recuperate. Then again, you have to be watching the fight and paying attention.
Behind the ear...
First was behind the head...
Leave boots alone
pretty clear ennis is ready for a title shot. Lipinets and Dulorme are both solid gate keepers and he handled both of em easily. surprised he even fought Dulorme, its a step down from Lipinets last fight
Dangerous mismatch
First punch is Rabbit Punch .
Wow that power is insane
Ennis management is wasting his Time & Money with these NO MONEY FIGHTS.
Boots is the next welterweight champion coming straight out of killadelphia
Those punches can't be right
That punch was to the back of the head
Ennis " truth" would put that weight bully Errol "lie" Spence on his place for real. Ennis way more versatile and has power both hands. Spence one dimensional.
If you're still hurt after the count, take a knee  ...get more time, gather yourself.  You may lose a point but you'll give yourself a fighting chance.
Pow, right in the kisser!
"NO  One Man Should Have All That Power"     MALCOLM X !  Spike Lee movie quote🤣🤣
Wish they would count like that when fury get knockdown. Good shit boots
I would like to see Ennis vs Garcia next
This is nothing new. This man has Ben slept on for some time now. Give him his roses and the fights that will actually challenge him
His defense is sus. He can't keep getting caught like that.
Right behind the ear
If that punch landed on Ennis would've came from bud or Errol etc... I like to see how he holds up cause he's tough
Daaaaaazam! That over hand left, had homie looking like he down a whole bottle of NyQuil👀 that sleepy sneezy ,nighttime medicine 👍😂😂😂😂
Unless I am wrong Adrien Broner started out on a very promising note like this. This dude needs to just ensure that he keeps his discipline...
He's fine as hell . Has a great chin.. power.. and boxing skills.... Heyyy husband !
“Dulorme” almost means “hurt me” in Spanish lol.
Well managed and exceptionally well promoted with excellent matchmaking. Now let’s see how he does with “A” fighters. Gonna be interesting.
Boots has a chin!!!  Dulorme caught him twice with monster right hooks during that last ditch effort and you could tell he was swinging for the fences!  Impressive!  Gotta wonder if he could take 2 Crawford counter rights like that but I wouldn't be suppressed if he could!
That was clearly a punch to the back of the head by boots.
Khamzat chimaev vs Errol Spence 2022
Fans get ready for fights that WILL NEVER HAPPEN!!!!! YAAAAAAY! Boxingis starting to get on my nerves 😫
Is this the best the promotional team for Ennis can do???? Thomas Dulorme had 5L’s before the fight?? What are those fights going to do for your career?
looked like he connected behind the head. Dangerous punch.
Exelente una super estrella pero pero solo le corrijo la guardia mucho cuidado con esto no se juega de
Ennis and Vergil are too big for WW. I see them moving to 54/60 maybe 68..Can't wait Ennis is a Talent that we haven't seen in many many decades
First of all, just wanna say that these are among the best highlights I've ever seen. Nice quality video too. Secondly, those knock downs didn't even look that brutal; I think it was just perfect timing. Great job!!
I cannot stand the main announcer (not Bernstein. He's rad). That faux excitement sounds so inauthentic.
fk ennis.. that was behind the ear... behind the ear is behind the head
Ennis is good but he's too easy to hit with an overhand right or left hook from a low crouch. Dulorme caught Boots twice after that first knockdown because Ennis was showboating and shoeshining. A savvy opponent will see these flaws and exploit them.
Ennis vs Crawford!!! And the neeeeeewwww.  I got a fat stack on Jaron if it happens.
Kevin kelly used to switch and have knock out power a little better  without a guy being already hurt
Mans looks like Floyd lol
Illegal blow to the back of the head.
That guy quit
Ennis Vs. Ugas!
Got hit in the back of the head at 2:01
bs he did hit him behind the head that was ilegal punch and hard
Ennis at 140? Zepeda would pick him apart!
This guy fight Crawford I'd bet the farm on Crawford. Just seen dude get hit flush too many times.
Hit in the back of the head
That first knock down WAS NOT a legal punch, landed right behind his ear. The ref was in place to see that and should have done something. Bad Referring.
Ennis is not ready yet. Spence or Crawford will smoke him eyes closed.
Behind the head that was very obvious and illegal. Reff should had let him recover.
Ennis is a manace in welterweight division.
Bernstein is a hater
Ennis vs Danny Garcia make it happen 🔥🔥
I think Ennis vs Garcia would be a great fight if he can’t get one of the belt holders next
Future champ!!
He hit him behind the head while he was not standing up....i dont get it
Wasn’t that first shot behind the head?
UNCANNY MAVERICK MARVEL   ABSOLUTELY 💯  very happy because he deserves a title fight 👌 I been following him for a while now. Boots is the ONE.  And would love 💘 to see if TANK is really gonna give it shot at welterweight.  Peace ✌
1:58 what fighter can switch and still hit T Bud Crawford
Insane ko? I saw the video and he went down twice. But there was no "insane" ko in this video
Not the Malcolm X movie quote
Boots vs Bud Would be Epic!
Lmaooo he only got the ko in round 1 bc of the punch in the back of the head cmon yall vergil stops ennis hopefully they make the fight, cause vergil pop said they had offered ennis back then but no response and when they ask ennis about vergil he looks shy answering the question and looks to go after an burn out thurman fk is wrong with him just like colbert calling out gamboa on ig lmaooo
Clearly an ilegal punch.
Ennis is a beast but I can't see his career lasting that long...one of the elite boxer/counter puncher will catch him when he gets to focused on being offendive.
Bud stops ennis
If u knw boxing that punch was illegal.. 🤦‍♂️💩 Boxing Suck these days
Time for the big dogs ! No more Charritos. Start with Danny or Ugas
Philly let’s go!!!
Ennis the man!!!
What ever happened to not hitting behind the head….? I’ve seen more & more knock outs that way in the last 5yrs then ever before…..
Ennis got a promising career.... Boots ain't no joke...
Delorme didn't match, shoes, shorts was off. While Boots was dripping with Blue head to toe.
Dulorme’s body language after that first knockdown said it all. He looked at his corner like ‘shall I continue?’
Errol Spence tells ennis watch what you wish for 😄😄😄😄
Canelo wil never face this guy
Boots is THE GUY!!! No one wants to face him.....he is THE FUTURE  He's the best  In my book....anyone in the 147lbs That includes Crawford...Spence.... One Time...Ugas all them cats!!! Boots is the One!!!💯💪🏾🏆
Kinda grazed the back of his head, not intentionally of course.
Equilibrium Glitch
I think that's an illegal punch
I think that's an illegal punch
well fight GGG then
Illegal punch
That looks like a behind the head punch to me 😕😕 but I think he ready for Crawford 🗣 Spence idk I’ll be the judge of that based off how Spence looks when he comes back
Nobody Fucking With Him‼️💯😎💯
In this age in Boxing.. In order to surpass and Be even Greater you have to learn the art of switching both styles  . Two is better then one if you put together and really  think about it
He's a bad boy!! Philly got another great boxer coming!!
Boots fine🥰🥰🥰It's the beard for me.💯❤💯✔
Man.!!  Boot's, Is Boxing ("Bruce Lee").! We Are All Looking At The Future Face Of Boxing.! I Literally Can't See Anyone Beating (Jeron"Boot"Ennis).! He's Already Philly People's Champion.! Boot's Is Taking Over The Welterweight Division.!!
This why they keep running Jr don't want it
First down looks to me like illegal punch on the back of the head. Not the Dulorme had any chance against Ennis,  It was a matter of time. Ennis Ugas will be a monster fight!
That first knockdown was from a hit that definitely landed in the back of the head, but it was a legal shot. Dulorme was ducking down and Ennis threw a natural punch that happened to hit behind the head (due to Dulorme's movement).
now i see. the jaw of ennis is glass also. mark my word. ennis jaw will give him a problem if he fight vergil ortiz thurman crawford spence. or even porter. he may try to fight danny g to see if his jaw is quality
Bring on ESJ , I got Errol Spence being scared to fight Bootz
This kid is going to be the next superstar in Boxing..24 years old 28-0 26 wins by KO already.. Crazy
Ennis vs virgil, winner fights the top Crop.
Crazy thing is if #TerenceWantedToHeCanHurtShawnThisSameWay sharp hooks and crosses always catches Shawn cause he deeps and sits low all rounds
This guy is a problem for anyone.
This guy is a problem for anyone.
How about a step up in competition if this guy is really that good? Why is he still fighting bums? "He goes down for the 9th time in his career!" Hilarious 😂
Nothing special wtf who in the duck has he fought get off the gas
blatant punch to the back of the head….. this is beyond unimpressive. I’d be filing a protest.
Shouldn't fight anybody that had his ass handed to him 9 time
Boots vs ortiz. Let's go!!!
Damn he's slick 👊💥
Ilegal punch in the back of the head
Dulorme is a genuinely tough, hard hitting guy. He stayed in there, landed a few well-timed, heavy shots, and Ennis just kept his focus and turned the heat up another notch. Damned impressive.
Whoa! This guy has insane skills and power. A fight with the equally skillful Bud Crawford or Thurman would be a blockbuster.
Bud doesn't want that smoke with Boots.
That's the bac of the head
Keep in mind that Jaron will more than likely fit well in the 154-160 weight division in due time..he's big for the Welterweight Division and would put an end  to Crawford & quite possibly Spence also... his crisp punching power reminds me of Donald Curry and Tommy Hearns.
Mannn I love Mauro!!
Cannot see Crawford or Spence handling this throwback to the 1980s Quality fighter....Bet Everything on Ennis..and you won't be Disappointed 💯👍😉
American commentary is far too animated for me.
That ref was counting slow ashell
Ennis the only one to beat Spence!! Opinions
thurman ortiz spence crawford mikey garcia.. whoever fight this guy..
He needs a challenge from a true contender 🤷🏾‍♂️ otherwise he'll do this to everyone he fights ,until then 👊🏾.
This guy isn't even fighting a top 10 guy please with the fake hype .
Idk that hit was in between legal and illegal
Illegal shot but prob wouldn’t matter at the end
From the first fight I seen from him I knew he was going to be a problem and still will be mark my words 😏 tank is dope, but Jaron is my new favorite boxer  💯
Boots Ennis vs. Danny Garcia makes sense at this point as Garcia is still a top-ten contender and no one has stopped him.  It'd be quite a feather in Boots' cap if he were to stop a guy with Garcia's quality who has a granite chin.
Bud gone smash him 🙄
Here’s another black person that political correctness is pushing towards a ko
0:08 Dulorme goes down for the *9th time* in his career. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Philadelphia Pride💪💪💪
First knockdown was an illegal shot behind the ear
looked like he took a dive
Nice punch to the back of his head. Shouldve been called
The latest hype job at 147 🚄
Jaron is coming for them and they know it. 😂
Wassup with behind the head or  the behind ear hits being counted I feel like fighter getting hit in the area won't be the same the deserve a couple seconds to recuperate the should be a illegal blow use this fight as example and wilder fury was hitting him behind the head/ear you don't have to be a professional fight that will get anyone off balance smh
This guy has been down 8 previous times in his career? 🍒 picking?
When is the next jake paul fight
That ref got to 4 on the second count way too quickly. Boots won fair and square but that ref is waaaay too quick with the counting.
Regardless if he got up from the canvas that was still behind the head,punches like that shouldn’t but taken lightly Ask the fighter where he got hit and make the decision on what to do as a referee So you can take a break when fighters get hit in the nuts but not behind the head this should be a critical mind set in boxing the nuts and behind the head LETS TAKE CARE OF OUR FIGHTERS LIFES!!!!!!!!!!!
BOOTS BEATS CANELO
Is everyone f****ing blind here, that first punch was completely behind the head super clearly and dulormes should have had the whole 5 minutes to recoup. Between corrupt judges, refs and delusional fans, boxing is unwatchable and unbearable.
Golpe de 🐰 no good suspensión es mejor el al brito esta borachooo
Very good , ennis vs canelo 🥊🥊🥊
Soon to be king of the welterweight division. Spence will vacate 147 before Boots gets to him and go to 154. Boots will get to Crawford whos too small to run
💯💫
This kid is gonna be a problem 💪🏽
.......................................canelo  ................next ..........
...................................canelo .................& Ernist .................
punch rabit
That was back of the head thooo ion think that count but in these sports they dont see everything
Ilegal punch
Ennis is a problem. He's ready for a championship fight. Make it happen!
They say he’s the next mayweather as long as he don’t run like him cause that’s all mayweather did is run
Ennis is amazing but he leaves his self open. I don’t know how well that will do vs top lv, but at the same time you have to adjust to ennis speed and size and length. If his chin is durable and he start blocking with his hands he’s hell. Looks crawford speed or higher, and ain’t that many top lv guy his speed.
Ennis been a beast since birth. Ennis may take ALL BELTS!!
Rabbit punch
Dulorme got a shot in at the end though
Another fantastic performance from Jaron! Philly in the building! 💯
Punch didn't look legal
terrible back of the head shot made him lose the fight he was not the same
He gotta better record than most these "big name"/ "prize fighters" !  28-0  NO MAN SHOULD HAVE ALL THAT POWER  HE DIDNT JUST KO HIM HE GD BUL... (GD GERVONTA DAVISED EEM... FRFR
.......here comes the Bandwagon gang.👀❌❌❌❌
That man can bang tru fighter
I hope he never fights Terrence Crawford. He would be destroyed!
What he just did would be comparable to playing the guitar from the left and right sides equally well and not missing a chord. He is blessed with almost too much talent for one man to possess. I know some of you might want to hate or believe it's too much hype; don't blind yourself with dislike
Oscar De la Hoya is too smart to allow Vergil to get anywhere close to Boots.
ennis is ready, gonna be a little bit before he gets a legit shot. there is a log jam at the top, the politics of boxing strike again.
Boots is gonna be a star. So much skill + ferocity
His not ready for Vergil Ortiz
Philly has a CHAMPION
this dude is good but he has fought straight cans
Wish this ref was the one for Tyson vs wilder he know how to count
A dam Boot kickin. Thanks to both men for the entertainment.
First Knock down was for sure behind the head... Second one was legit.
No one man should have all that POWER! Commentator are hilarious😄
Did I see that right was that an illegal punch to the back of the head?  After rewatching that it was legal...Errol better stay away from him!
Who the hell is Dulormes?
Spencer Thurman Crawford GGG Charlo kittys Ugas Fight some one Elite, but someone coming from 2 straight  loses.. That's lame!
He better leave that boy from Dallas TX alone
I don't know who numero uno is, but it is easy to imagine him as numero dos.
Boots!!!!
The first punch was to the back of the head not impressed
This guy fights like a Mexican 🇲🇽  the future is starting to look bright for boxing
Look I like this guy but is he ready for the to dogs not sure but there's no one else for him to fight oh well we will see
That quote is ORIGINALLY from the movie of Brother Spike Lees Malcolm X...The Black Prince✊🏾👑💯
Ennis is a BEAST!!!!  GO PHILLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
He may be the greatest talent ever
So please tell me who he just beat never heard of him??
Ennis is 28 with 26 KOs and has fought fucking nobody. Boxing is so fucked. Cherry picking and promoters getting in the way of bullshit.
Dumorme has been washed up for several years now. I won’t give Ennis that much credit yet. He’s good but he needs better opposition
Oops, I WAS WRONG!!! Terence Crawford is NOT the second coming of Marvelous Marvin Hagler ...Boots Ennis is 🥊🥊
jaron got a nice chin. dulorme hit him with a few clean shots before that ko and ennis ate them up
I don't care who Dulorme fought that night he would had got KO!.
Ennis will receive more than the double with what he sid to Dulorme...
That was definitely back of the head
The future of boxing is here now 🙌  welcome Ennis
Jaron Ennis is a very EVIL fighter! The referee just stared at Dulerme dalling down by a very hard hit at the nape, natirally Dulorme was already weaken by that beey EVIL hit! I hate Ennis for being a VERY UNFAIR AND DIRTY FIGHTER!
Not many fighters at 147 or 154 want a piece of Boots. I heard Crawford tell Spence to fight him first and then Spence said "you fight him first Crawford"....
This guy beats bud and esj
That was behind the head.  BS
Still won't beat Spence!
Wearing a skirt
He kept getting up though Enis don’t got Ko power
bro got mad skills fr
when you wait to long to fight each other, then young new blood come up
the 147 pound Roy jones version lol.. good by Spence & crawford. there's a new sheriff in TOWN lol....
Ennis and Shakur are in my opinion the most talented fighters out there right now.
Must be a good fight to crawford!?
at this stage  dulorme  is nothing put a punching bag . oh my god he is down for the 9th time lol like duh thats what he is known for ( hype job )
Back of the head
Dulorme is a bum ennis need to only fight the top of the heap now!
Ennis can beat Ugas or Spence
Weak all weak
Props to Dulorme for going out swinging
Time to fight spence or ugas
Rabbit punch
He wobble Ennis a little and he took a half step back.
Look at dulorme legs lockup
Off topic I need some advice my lil brother is training to be a boxer he is only 15 only started a year ago he sent me a vid of him training he has had 11 amatuer fights I would love someone to or a few who really no boxing to check it out and give your honest opinion please
1:02 slow down the video 0.25x illegal hit
Boots is the best all around fighter I've seen with my eyes since "Pretty Boy" Floyd Mayweather 💯
Did you see him eat that punch? Wow you ninjas in trouble.
Ennis PHILA GREAT!!!
De conejo
Told you before Ennis has crazy genetics he’s so strong! The guys chin and power are crazy he needs top competition
Jaron!
3 piece no biscuit please 🤣🤣🤣1:46💪🏿
As boxing standard now a days, every top dogs will duck this dude or they'll blame their promoters.
NB.
1:44 A very perfect left-right-left combo from the textbook. Good night, Thomas. Come back soon, buddy. But yeah, I love that slo-mo shit, really :)
Where’s the normal speed fight
Boots is dangerous 💪🏾🥊
That is just nice clean punches and I am looking forward to watching more of the guy
This kid is special just love boxing
"INSANE KO BY ILLEGAL BLOW" Obvious hit behind the head. FOH
Boots is going to be a future star for sure if keyshawn can get to 147 him and boots would be a hell of a fight 🔥 🔥 🔥 💯
Knocked him down then switch southpaw... sneaky good
Man this dude is the truth.  I can he him as a middleweight.  He looks like hes 160
He hit him behing the head
Boots is a great young fighter but don't get it twisted Crawford and Spence, AIN'T NO WALK IN THE PARK AND THEY DEFINITELY AIN'T NO THOMAS DELORME SO DON'T GET IT TWISTED I THINK BOOTS IS IN THE TOP FIVE POUND FOR POUND HOWEVER UP AGAINST ERROL SPENCE OR TERENCE CRAWFORD BOOTS MIGHT GET KNOCKED OUT 🤔 HOWEVER I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE FIGHT EITHER ONE SPENCE OR CRAWFORD
Ennis vs Crawford 2022. You heard it here first
Let's see if he looks like this against somebody that knows how to move and throw punches. Not like this guy. I mean who was the other dude?🤷‍♂️
Man that 3 peice was so clean
Renello i love your play by play. 👍
Not hating on him or anything he's got skills. But we'll see if that power carries on on when he starts fighting top tier competition
Ennis need to face the real test Virgil Ortiz.
Spense vs ugas,  Crawford vs porter vs thurman,  Ennis vs ortiz
Don't get to excited. The announcer said he went down for the "9th time of his career". Jaron is next best talent.
Ya retírate Thomas, no más 🤭
I was watching this fight with 2 of my lady friends in the hot tub. This young kid has talent.
The first knockdown was behind the head but not intentional.  The 2nd knockdown was a beauty, with 3 punches connecting.  Enis is superior to both Crawford and Spence and is the future of the division.
AQUI LO QUE VEO, ES UN REFEREE SUPER IMB3CIL, PUES EL GOLPE QUE LO TIRÓ A LA LONA ES UN RABITT PONCH, GOLPE PROHIBIDISIMO, QUE NO FUÉ SANCIONADO, POR LA CUAL , NO DEBE DE SER LEGAL SU TRIUNFO....
Durlome was just a punching bag no movement
He's very good reminds me of RJJ and Floyd. I think he beats EVERYONE except Crawford. He does have a huge chance against Crawford tho.
He fought glass joe come on now
*Boots is a legend in the makings!!!*
As soon as Boots ate that right he went into kill mode
28-0    26 KO’S …. Impressive prospect is what I see… Let’s back off talking about putting him in with a Beast like Bud or Spence… I’d like to see him fight a somebody before putting such high expectations on him… Mikey G, Danny G, Thurman, Porter, Avesnayan, Ortiz ? At least let him fight someone in the rankings.. pshh
It seems boxers are aiming at the  temple more, and borderline back of head. It's getting dangerous . I'm just saying.
He reminds me of young Roy Jones
Straight outta philly represent boots
Weak
That boy damn near perfect
Just the way I taught him how to knock out people
Philly y'all got 1 he is the real deal!
Washed up Delourme
Jaron Ennis vs Stanionis
Maybe next fight should be with Danny Garcia really test him self
That first knock down was dirty on the back of the head. Look like a rabbit punch
First punch was a rabbit punch
PUNCH WAS BEHIND THE HEAD.
This new era of welterweights are stacked. But as expected we will see a lot of 🦆ing in the division.
That’s a bad man 🪵🪓
Believe me you can always count on the comment section to ruin all your experiences..
Holy fuckin shit!!! I keep tellin yall!!!
I don't see anything special I haven't seen within the last 25 years of boxing.
Only TC can match his skill set. Except Boots is the bigger man. Spence, Thurman, Porter and the rest of the WW division will probably get wrecked by Boots. I said not too long ago they should’ve picked a fight with him then before he gets even better. But by now, I think it’s too late. Spence is no longer the “boogeyman”.
Ennis the truth ! He not gonna get Crawford or Spence unless it is after they fight each other. My guess is he won't get a title shot unless somebody vacates. Nobody is running to fight Ennis.
👢 👢
Ennis vs butaev next !!!! Undefeated fighters fighting each other ‼️  28 and 0 vs 15 and 0 both can crack  I'll be a terrific fight ‼️
Man T Bud Crawford Already Hulk Smashed That Shit , that boy Ate Left Overs
He looks like a natural super middleweight in size. Yeah the Welterweight division is in trouble
Wow another ez fite.  I cant wait for him to step up competition.
Boots NGAAAAA MY GUY PHILLY BOOTS 💥🤼💥🤼💥💥💥🤼💥🤼💥
That looked like a behind the head punch.
*REMINDS ME OF CRAWFORD JUS YOUNGER*
Completely legal punch. Good luck filing to overturn that.   Ennis is the future King of the division.
*FAST*
That was behind the head
If he wasn’t before… he just became the boogeyman of the 147lb Division.  I’ve got to see Boots and Virgil Ortiz battle it out
Did look like it was a punch behind the head though…
Roy Jones & Sweet Pea had this child 🥊🥊
No doubt Ennis was gonna won this fight but that first punch was behind the head , illegal punch🤷🏽
That right hand was clearly behind the head horrible job by the ref
Al is quick to say illegal but had to eat crow again.
Definitely behind the head!!! The second one wasn’t
Ennis is a good boxer but needs to start fighting good fighters and not cab drivers.
This guy is the a champ in the making.. it looks like he likes t actually destroy his opponents.. fun times coming up
Ennis is good but a guy with a good jab that push him back will give him problems. His defense is suspect.
Dulormes career was over after Crawford. He had alot of potential. I think he got discouraged after Crawford really beat him
Mama Mia!!!
Is he ready?
Yea Ennis is a problem for the division. Give him. Porter Spence Crawford please
Who tf is this guy?? He look like he fought someone that just stepped in the ring from the crowd
Look at the future of Boxing 🥊🇺🇸🏅 the Multi Million Dollar MAN Boots Ennis has also signing with showtime Boxing so you know that's going to be Worth Multi Millions, Great Job kid.
Dude been grounded several times 🪞🔨
What he gotta do to get his respect and his title shot? Boul is undefeated, walking through people knockout ratio is crazy, what else he gotta do? Give boul his shot he doing it for our city let’s fuckin go
He could’ve gotten up again, he just didn’t want anymore of that work. Smart choice. 😏 Let’s go Philly!!! 💯
0:37 Boots threw defense out the window for a bit and got caught by a clean right counter that buzzed him.
I can't believe no one talks about jaron Ennis
The one who has the same power or maybe more who can switch southpaw is Crawford
P Ennis
Too many fighters getting  hit behind the ear n refs don't say shit. Dude was gone get knocked out likely but getting hit behind your head really shakes the equilibrium.
This man is the new problem in the Welter weight division. With his skill set, he is capable of taking on and probably defeating the big dogs in the division.
How is this an "insane" knockout?
Damnnn
Punch was behind his head
Gotta see him fight better competition tired of him beating bums.
This guy's a beast
Bud stops Dulorme years ago, and he has fought anyone.  Ennis stops Dulorme, he's great. 🤣
First knockdown fucked his equilibrium up and it was over
Sometimes the left hand is stronger then your right because you using left less then the right if you righty
Dulorme is not a class A fighter an on top of that dat Punch was  behind the head bro ,
Im sure even josh taylor beats him
Any fighter who can switch fom orthodxo and southpaw COMFORTABLY will always be a problem. Its literally a dime a dozen.
😳 Jaron Ennis is a dangerous dude!
You know Errol gonna run
BACK OF THE HEAD. IF ITS PASSED THE EAR, ITS BEHIND THE HEAD. STOP ✋ IT!
Ennis vs crawford
Mismatch
Speed, Power, and an extremely high Boxing IQ Jaron Ennis is the number one fighter to watch out for in this division! I guarantee the kid will be a Champion.
Terrance Fraudfer will duck this man
Overrated af. Put Vergil in there with him and he coming out on a stretcher
Boots gonna cleanout the whole welterweight division  all of.them he got power both hands switch hitter speed youth reach height & meaness  he is unbeatable !!
He fought a guy that loss last like 5 fights
Boots reminds me of a better prime AB. Future champ in the making.
Let's go Ennis! The dude is a problem and I don't see many being able to solve it.
Boots is the truth!!! He's a problem in the Welterweight division!!!
They say Virgil Otis can fuck with this man I say he’ll naw
It was the jumping in left hook that really hurt him.
Boots will KO every champion out there Spence will never fight him 🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊
Virgil Ortiz Jr. Vs Jaron Ennis  Who y'all got? Evenly matched but I got Ortiz Jr. If that fight ever happens.🥊
Ese primer golpe lo desmantelo
That was a BIG behind the head punch!!! You can’t deny that . Dude punched (pushed)him down not knocked down
.... I feel like this is a serious over credit. Dude is a bum.... N he is clearly wayyyyyyyyy slower. I don't know. I'll give credit when he fights someone that is good. I like his fight style tho.
A little bit behind the head?????????
Ennis “superstar”!!!
That second Knock down was flawless. Whoa them hands are fast
It's funny how these boxers look good until they run into that brick wall. 😂 Wilder was knocking everyone out until he ran into Fury 😂 We will see what happens, stay tune.
Ennis vs Virgil Ortiz is the fight to make, winner should be next for titles fight vs bud or errol
Looked like the second right hand Ennis got caught with rattled him a little
Boots hasnt fought any top competition! he isnt worthy of anything! What is it about what you idiots do not understand that NOBODY WILL FIGHT HIM YOU MORONS LOL. i swear like it goes in 1 ear out the other like it does with my gf
hahahahah that dude went stiff
Fantastic win. I believe Boots has all the wrinkles. However, Dulorme is not Bud and he is not Spence. There are levels to this shit!!!!!!
Boots can’t get caught like that all the time
Looking like money may punching like pretty boy floyd
jaron ennis vs vergil ortiz
His opponent was dropped 8 times before  lol    = bum!
😳😳😳👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽🥇🥇🥇🥊🥊🥊
That punch was behind the head lol
Would love to see him fight Bud since he mirrors his style and thinks he's better than him. Don't get me wrong , he's a good fighter but Terrance is a whole different monster and Ennis have never really had a credible fight.
Great fighter. My only concern is he relies on his athletic ability a lot similar to one of my favorite boxers Roy Jones.
Looks like a young Roy
Yea he is ready for a title fight
Ennis' shot placement and accuracy is up there with the best.
Ennis is ready for the elite in the division.
Yup, Boots is def ready to mix it up with the 'elite" !
The key to beating boots is to stay in his chest, like a maidanana or porter don’t give him any space! You won’t win like that!
This kid is a serious serious talent. Definitely a future star in 147
Best welterweight in the world!
An illegal knock out now get off his nutts If he hit ennis behind the head he would’ve been disqualified everybody knows that.
Anybody look like a monster against sb thats not good
Beautiful work by Jaron here, man! Philly, we may have another one! Granted Dulorme isn't necessarily A-list opposition and we do have to indeed need to wait and see how Boots does with better competition. You can see the 'special' in him already. Great young talent. Can't wait to see how he flourishes in the future!
Ennis is a hype job in the making.   Fought nobody and gets caught clean off stone cold bums.
That was to the back of the head or...
fake fight.
He hasn't been tested your only as good as who you fight.
Wilder needed this ref against Tyson Fury. He counts fast as heck.
That last combo was perfect
Time to start thinking about the icecream truck business
the fact that he has an solid chin really completes the package, he ate a shot well in this fight and took some good ones from lipinets
Clear foul
Illegal punch
Ennis is a star. Let the ducking begin.
that was behind the head
Gonna keep my eye on this guy.
He never recovered from the side of the head shot or the back of the head shot...
Those behind the ear shots are lethal, they should be outlawed, that’s closing in on  brain stem territory.
Boots looking real sharp and I'm seeing the hype now.   Boots vs Virgil Ortiz will be a huge fight one day but don't expect that anytime soon.  Their gonna let that fight stirr up and make it big since there both young and talented, promoters already see money signs making that fight big in the future.
No disrespect but who is this dude and why do so many people care about him all of a sudden
Dulorme was coming into the fight having lost his last 2 fights and 4-4 in his last 8. Just to put some context. Boots will be P4P for sure and Unified champ but this was a super easy fight. 🥊
Maybe they should find him better competition than uber drivers and H.E.B. baggers.
Mukulnya otak belakang..tp wasit tetep menghitung
Boots reminds me so much of Roy it’s scary. Buddy’s not going to lose rounds let alone fights. Please bring on Bud and Spence.
I always wonder how a rising prospect somehow puts the division on noticed after defeating a faded vet that barley was a champion
I think the first k.o was hit behind of the head smh
Great win for Boots
Ennis gonna be the best fighter of this decade imo the boy doesn’t do anything bad boxes and hits well from both stances, had nice footwork, seems to have a good chin and is quick gonna be interesting to see what he’s all about
Definitely back of the head watch that shit on slow mo first shot was definitely illegal
Good fighter.
this guy is a beast. He and Lopez are the best young fighters in the world. He  will be the champion soon. He needs to get the opportunity to spence, crawford or ugas next. Or would be nice to see him fight Ortiz or at least Danny Garcia or Stanionis. He is very Roy Jones like.
Right in the back of the head. illegal.
In slow mo Ennis was buzzed twice ...if punches actually followed up could of been bad... but instead he kept his composure gathered his senses and finished the job... Mad respect
Very gifted fighter his only flaw is he is not a toe to toe fighter I kind of peep it in the amateurs vs Gary ant Russell…. Spence would be a matchup nightmare he going after the wrong guy if you ask me
dude why i think that was giannis antetokounmpo boxing lmao yo im so baked rn lololol
WELL DAMN! and he's only 24 years old! The Welterweight division has boogeyman
Ennis 2 heavy 4 Crawford #POWER
Ennis Is the future of boxing 🥊- skills for days… maybe the Cubans Can give him problems but I don’t see ennis losing to anybody at that division
Boots has officially arrived!
White commentators are goofy af. "No one man should have all that power". Goofy ass.
Ennis need to fight in 2 weeks
Don't sell yaself short tryns fight the smaller fighters lol gone to light heavyweight or heavyweight "champ "
The way I see it, the first knockdown he hit dulorme in back of the head,. Why didn't the ref call it?
Impressive indeed, but the kid needs at least one top ten win before he starts calling out those names that are already coming out of his mouth. Talking about cleaning up a division that has crawford and spence sitting at the top without a real challenge yet. I like his confidence,  but the kid is going to be ducked until he fights a legit 147 challenge.
Can’t wait to see him fight again. When I get this money. Definitely! Going start promoting championship fights… Every fights should be Championship Fights.
He hit dude behind the ear like tyson fury did wilder
Rabbit punch all day
We all knew boots was beating Thomas lol but when Bud did it to Thomas Delorme in his prime oh "Thomas was a tomato can" 🤣🤣🤣🤣 man bud can't can't catch a break
That back of the head punch just finished it, before it started.
That's crazy how they didn't wanna say Crawford name. It's easy to know Crawford is the best switch hitter with power in both hands and stances. They be on bullshit
(No one man should have all that power )I see motherfukers don't mind mocking Minister Malcolm X
Stanionis went 12 rounds with Dulorme, Crawford went 6 with Dulorme and Boots stops Dulorme in 1 round 😱.Only problem with Boots is he's not signed to Haymon or PBC, Haymon has ALL the welterweights and he's the manager/Advisor to the fighters,Al NOT giving no top fighters to Boots who's not signed to him.Boots promoter is Duncan,and Duncan needs to pay the fighters what they want to fight Boots,he needs some investors or Showtime to back Boots,until then Boots not getting a  the fights he want ,and a title shot until he becomes mandatory or title eliminator . stephen Espinoza hopefully can convince Showtime to invest in Boots#JaranWick#MrCatchaBody
ennis is the most underrated welterweight today change my mind
0:37 that was a nice right 🥊 , ennis was literally unfazed by it tho damn
His defense needs to be tighter, he drops that left too low. But he is entertaining for sure. Not sure if he's ready for the top dogs though.
Jaron Ennis will be a name not easily forgotten in the boxing books. Speed,power, IQ. Numero #1
That straight left may have broken bul jaw! See the graphics in slow motion. Snapped backwards!
If wilder ref counted like this Tyson fury would’ve lost
Slow count smh
He fought a bum who cares...
Its good he got the KO but that first punch really rocked him he never recovered watch out WW division because Boots is coming better yet he s here
They better stop playing in give that man a real title fight
Everyone has a face until they get punched in the game plan-Tyson Mike
For real I think Ennis could get ESJ
If you want behind the head the impact is like getting hit 10x harder than the chin or front head..after being hit on the back of the head it's very difficult to come back.
Great black hope
And THIS IS why he is becoming my favorite fighter. So much damn skills and power. Good shit Boots
Jaron boots is a bummer he pays to win fights...plus he never fights any well known fighter
Precision at its finest.🥊
Bernstein: "WHAT FIGHTERS DO YOU KNOW THAT CAN SWITCH TO LEFTY AND STILL HAVE THAT KINDA POWER? HE'S A SWITCH HITTER!" Anyone with a brain: Terence Crawford!!!  You know, the P4P best guy in this division. Smfh
This guy's kill ugas  Spencer to
"What fighters do you know can switch and still have that kind of power?" Terrence Crawford
Okolie vs enis 2022 👀
Deverda que lla tiene que retirate el bolxeo no juego You Lost t be need to be mored seriously 😑😑😑😑😑
Que esperan para enfrentarlos con los de su nivel. A mi que ya he visto mucho boxeo, nadie me sorprende si no es peleando con los campeones.  Por ejemplo, ustedes creen que yo puedo valorar a gervonta Davis sin haber peleado con lomachenco, teofimo lopez,  hanney etc.
It landed a lotta bit behind the head.
Illegal hit
Spence and Bud better hurry up and get their fight on, because Boots is about to shake up this division
It was clearly in the back of the head
Ennis vs Danny Garcia. Make it happen, all out Philly war.
Boots pressure also!!! 💪🏾
The crazy thing is Bootz is under 25 with the whole package HE IS COMING!
U gon see dudes vacating belts to duck this guy he the truth
The guy he fought showed me nothing.
Did he hit him in the back of the head that put him down the first time??
Impressive.
Lol ennis got rocked tho then he knocked dude out lol 😆
That guy had 8 knock downs before this lmao
I saw a punch behind the head. (not Jaron’s fault)
BETTER THAN UGAS, ORTIZ, PORTER AND THURMAN..GIVE HIM UGAS OR SPENCE NOW
Ennis vs Crawford ??
What’s actually his original stance? Orthodox or southpaw?
Who are they????
Dulorme's fault for dipping his head like that, so no points should have been deducted from Ennis, but that should not have been ruled a knockdown.
Crispy 2-3-2 put him out
The top guys should have fought Ennis early
Lol Spence/Crawford will beat the brakes off of Ennis but him and Shawn would be a great fight.He will definitely be actually tested instead of fighting this bum Dulorme
Dude got beat by a guy wearing a skirt
He is going to have to kick 🚪 in and get a belt!!! Otherwise the top dogs are not going to fight him!!! HIGH RISK LOW REWARD!!!
At least feed this guy Thurman or Garcia. They’re not busy
Started it all w/ a punch to the back of the head, snuck another one in right before the second knock down.. 🤦🏾‍♂️
They dare disrespect Crawford like he ain't another fighter that switches stances and can knock you out in either stance smh Crawford vs Boots would be explosive 50/50
Young man did in 1 round what it took Terrence Crawford 8 rounds to do
Can’t wait to see Virgil take this guy out
Boots is the real deal
That was beautiful rabbit punch behind the ear nicely done…
That 3 piece to end it was pure beauty 🔥🔥🔥 especially in slow-mo
Ennis is always open for counters it’s just his insane speed, setup and power that overshadows it. And I know it wasn’t on purpose that punch was in the way back in the head and Dulorme should have been given all the time he needed to recover even if it wouldn’t change his fate.
Great fighter, can see him being avoided. Still we shouldn’t get too carried away, he’s fought 2 decent names, one coming off 2 losses and the other coming off a draw with a Canadian nobody. Hope he gets to fight a real top 10 contender in form, then we can get excited about him fighting the champs. I’ve seen way too much boxing to think a fighter Is going to dominate when they haven’t fought anyone that good yet. But his talent is obvious.
He went out like a G
Dulorme's record is 3-5-1 since Ennis turned pro 5 years ago. This fight means nothing.
*Bud, Spence Jr, Shawn, Thurman better look out 😳😳.*
Ennis has an effective jab,just need to keep his head off the line.
Dulorme was definitely a shell of himself not impressive
Illegal punch back of the head 😩😩 common ref fight shouldn't count.
Ennis vs. Yeleussinov needs to happen!
That first shot landed more on the back of the head than the side of the head. Still doesn’t tell us much about Ennis since Dulorme was already coming off 2 losses
I don’t expect any boxer to recover from taking a shot like that from behind the head.
omg!! boots is the TRUTH!!!
Yeah Cuzin y’all did it again !!! Philly stand up…. And Keith Thurman said he doesn’t know who he is????really ???? Then he he should take the fight and to the welterweight div.stop bitching or move out of the weight class!!!
So why Crawford is so silence about Jaron Innis? A coward duckling fake champ...
So the refs counts only applies to everyone else except Fury in America
I Thought gray russel had the fastest hands in boxing looks like boots boots the boogie man I think i'm but my money on boots.
Fool the nasty💪🏿💪🏿🔥🔥
Dude went down for the 9th time in his career and Ranallo screaming like Ennis   just KOed Floyd Mayweather.
1 time come fight this man
Boots the real deal
Boots!!
Nobody wants to see Boots. They all ducking homie.
Back in the head!! That's the evil punch
Bad ass fight
Hits hard too
First punch behind the ear had him finished
He should step up and fight someone legit now, whole lotta nobody's get him a title fight let's see if he survives that.
This guys taking over !!!!!!
Illegal behind the head shot just like most of wilders KOs
I’m starting too like bootz
Everybody beats this guy. This was not a test.
Boots gonna have a helluva time trying to get smoke. Even Shawn Porter done already said he’s not fighting him and Shawn Porter will usually fight anybody. Bet your life that Errol the 🦆 Spence ain’t getting in there with Boots!
Commentator said it was pretty legal. It clearly wasn’t legal. Again it’s not the winners fault.
Thomas dolurme no is boricua is dominican
That first knockdown was a back of the head shot. That coulda been dudes fault in trying to dodge it but he was fully himself when he got knocked down again. That head shot really did the damage
It was not Puerto Rico’s night
Its gonna be harder 2 find boots a fight smh killa
I know Boots is going to have a lot of HATERS...Boots skills is just on another level. He finishes dudes that don't belong in the ring with him. He can't control who he fights. He's called out Spence and Crawford multiple times. This young man has generational talent and to be honest I don't think Bud or Truth can beat him. Also, every fighter gets caught even the great Floyd, Boots has a good chin and he won't be careless with better competition. He put everyone on notice in the 47 division.
Back of the head shot 🖕🏼
Ugas will knock him, his very dangerous figther like terence Crawford
Run that Thurman vs Ennis!!!
Boots makes Spence vs Bud seem like a fight for 2nd place
Now that’s how the Wilder vs Fury refs supposed to count a knockdown.
I LIKE  BOOTS BUT THAT WAS BEHIND THE HEAD NO FAULT OF BOOTS DULORME DUCK LOW  BUT ITS NOT A CRAZY KO LIKE ADVERTISED
He has every right to have all that power😹😹
Shit was wack
That some prime Roy shit right there.
Boots about to be the face of the sport.
This kid has unlimited potential....he gotta keep that left hand up more though
That first left hook was insane. That started everything. That’s just beautiful boxing. This boy has a future. Them combos were sick.
#STAYAWAYFROMBOOTS all i can say
That was an illegal punch,however Dulorme is not a good boxer ,he is a stiff,but that was an illegal punch.
I called this year's ago. They don't know boxing. Boots will be top 5 in the world
Ennis' mannerisms (not his fighting style) remind me of Mayweather.  He is one gifted and powerful dude in that ring.  He's an ultra elite boxer-puncher with the potential to be an all-time great.
I told y’all this boy is Roy Jones in the flesh he beats all of them lol
THIS BOY IS DANGEROUS!
heard about him.......checked him out......didn't disappoint
Boots is Dangerous
Enis is going to struggle to get Any of the top 5 fighter at welterweight to fight him simply because he not worth the risk in fighting Enis only way to get a big fight will be throw a mandatory it’s that simple
He active he beat a real contender...fight Thurman or Ortiz first...
LMAO at the Announcer.  What the hell relevance is, how many times he got knocked down in his career? That's like him saying this is the 4,000th time he got punched in the face!!! Who keeps track of how many times someone got knocked on their ass in their career??? 😅🤣😂 OMG this is the 100th time he yawned this month!!!  Those are some weird statistics.
Why isn't wilder fans complaining about the slow count here as well? 🧐😂  First knockdown count to 8 but in the timer minute 2.00 to 1.48 Second knockdown count to 10, timer from 1.26 to 1.12..  Wilder fans won't complain here because they don't care about any other fighter lol.
This this Terence Crawford’s only challenge at 147
Everyone calling out Errol Spence lol I wanna see boots and Keith Thurman they both fast with power
That was the back of the head tho .. let’s be real
He needs to up his game. Over protected for great talent.
Illy Philly gave Boricua a Philly three piece combo, yo! Got dude out of there with the KO!
Gotta get him better comp
Jaron boots Ennis offensive repertoire is crazy. He can slug it out or box his way to victory. Not sure if the top welterweights in the division will jump in the ring with him anytime soon. His team should offer Danny Garcia or Keith Thurman a paycheck to fight.
Terrance Crawford  throws his overhand right like that.
Rigged as hell…
Lets go Boots 💪💪
That last ten count was half the time fury was on the canvas for lol. No conspiracy
They better fight boots before he put. A boot in someoned butt
He ducked in and got clipped.  Equilibrium was gaaaawn.
He called out Spence I got Boots on that one.
Insane? This internet world is killing me, it was a nice KO but not insane not even close. Wilder had 3 insane knockouts. Rosado had previously a very nice one. Davis KO Vs Leo was pretty good but this one was a usual Knockout
Woooow!! Did not the fight ending that quick. Ennis is definitely in the mix. Hope we get too see all these badass welterweights actually fight each other. Next 2-4 years is gonna be great to see if they do
He fighting bums , when he fight someone with skills then we will see. The dude he just fought has no chin just like most of the opponents he has fought. So I’m not impressed and he is definitely not ready for Errol or Bud. He hasn’t been tested yet we don’t even know if he can switch his game plan up when something isn’t working. But with all that said he does have some skills. He needs to keep that chin tucked , because slim caught him with a nice hook Because he got too overzealous and thought it was sweet. You Gotta keep your head on a swivel at all times even when you get your may hurt
Boots wayway bigger than dulorme
Emm... illegal punch on the first KO... so yeah another for the refs... guy has skills but a punch behind the ear.. is a automatic win for anyone with or without skills GG's
Rabbit rabbit
Andy Cruz would whoop Jaron Ennis 7 days of the week.
Ennis vs Ugas make it happen 🥊
I'm not impressed with this guy yet
If he gets to spence or Crawford before they fight each other I think he’ll beat one of them lol
Bad ass
Jaron is very impressive.
EJ & Crawford ARE NOT DULARME!!!! Timing beats speed ALL DAY LONG!!! That power can be negated by well placed body shots....which EJ has,& power also,& a Southpaw,& as much as I don't like Crawford,he can switch hit also,with power & speed!!! Boots is NICE, with speed & power,but let's PUMP THE BREAKS....the ? Is how's he gonna respond when he gets REALLY touched to the BODY,& OR CHIN!!! So u don't think Derrick James & Bo Mac,who have the top 2 boxers in the ww division won't break Boots down on film & come up with a game plan to beat him????? I still don't think he's stronger than,or hits harder than EJ!!!
Another great performance by Ennis..  A joy to watch.
I see flashes of Mayweather with his Philly stance. He also makes his upper body narrow like Floyd
Ennis can win to Ugaz, Spence and Crawford
That first one was square in the back of the head
It’s time for PBC to showcase Boots. The guy needs title fights. Boots is a fireball
Illegal punch behind the head. Why he fighting old ass Thomas anyway? WTF
Boots is the truth🥊🥊
Wake me up when he fights someone in the top 10, shit top 15. 28 fights and only Lipinets to his name?
If he was slicker on defense would be unstoppable but he got next for sure! He got it
Much success to boots in this boxing game,215 💪🏽💯🥊
Totally illegal punch 🤦🏾‍♂️
I like Vergil but Boots stops him in 5
Everyone on the top of 147 is dodging this guy
As expected he beat a guy who had 3 losses and a draw in his last 5, and as expected people are massively overreacting in the comments
dude was switching stances and looked as good as his main stance, impressive.
PHILLY 💪🏾💯
Dulorme is only gatekeeper. He lost 4 fights in a row before this fight. I wasnt impressed.
Ennis was balanced on his feet with his  combination punches in that slow motion replay. Great job, champ💯🥊
Vergil Ortiz is no matched to Jaron Ennis
He fights like Rolly. But these kind of fighters are dangerous. Prime example if they catch you right.
BOOTS!!!!
He is as pleasant to watch as the great great Roy Jones Jr.
Vergil ortiz is too much for jaron for sure. Vergil is a beast
2nd fight I see Ennis take a shot flush to the chin and not even blink. This young rumbler is a PROBLEM for anyone in that welterweight division. We will see some other individuals with title aspirations move up or down in weight pretty soon.
boots need to fight someone with a pulse
Who did he knock out??
That automatic crouch was fatally wrong, totally his fault to get in the way of that overhead.
Dulorme is no joke. Ennis is good. He punches to the body a lot and has a lot of power. He’s slick, big and strong. Tough to beat!
Looks so easy. Is he already better than the rest at 147?🤔
They need to stop messing around and fight guys like Spence, Crawford, and even Thurman! All these dudes know Ennis is comin in hot, they don’t want none of him🔥🌪💨
The best young fighter
Does Ennis hit harder than Vergil Ortiz?
Ennis a issue 😖🔥
He did what he supposed to do .
Dulorme made a business decision not to get up at 10 lol
Watch out Bud, Ugas & Spence!
He wasn't knocked out at all
I wanna see a rematch of ennis vs Gary antuane russle I think ennis would win this time
He definitely looked good but Spence is a different monster plus he’s back with blue ray!!sheesh!I wanna see boots fight someone 1st…I know it’s gonna be hard cause the top guys not gonna give him a chance just yet..
Ennis needs to start going to sports event mingling with the stars. Dude needs more exposure. Crazy.
STOP RUNNING ORTIZ!!! BOOTS VS ORTIZ PPV MAKE IT HAPPEN
Can boots smoke Bud ???
That look like it was behind the head very dangerous
Mr. Catch a body 💪🏼
Oh and by the way.. Berlanga won't go far either, he's next!
As a proud puertorican myself and boxing fan (WE) are done in boxing unfortunately. 2 went down last night just in the first round, Dolurme and Vargas. Puertorican boxers simply don't fight with that chip on their shoulders plain and simple. Viva Mexico for carrying the sport! 🇲🇽🙋‍♂️
Dulorme was just a stay-active fight for Boots. He's 3 fight a year boxer so we'll probably see more of these until he moves up the rankings and becomes someone's mandatory. I'll take what I can get until then. This was just a check fight for Dulerome.
Spence can run from Crawford but not Ennis lol
Ennis a problem straight up
No one can bit this guy defence power and speed.
Dude been a problem for a few years now… wayyy too much skill
Hel be too good for crawford man. He's thr most complete fighter with heavy heavy hands. Scary combo
Delorme went out like a boss.
I’ve been saying it for a long time Ennis is a problem. I feel that a fight with Ennis vs Spence is just as interesting as a fight with Crawford vs Spence. Ennis presents serious problems for both men.
Looks like a strike to the back of the head 0.6 seconds
scared of stanionis can you prove sometihing douchebag  with real fighters?
Yeah he’s ready for the top 5 Welterweights. Errol still crush him tho 🤣
This is gonna make it even harder for him to fund opponents 🙄
Boots a bad man. He definitely will be champion soon!
Bags of talent but he's 30 fights in and hasn't fought anyone his own weight class with  pulse. About time he stepped up or he'll have a wilder resume.
He beat a 140 pounder
Boots is a good fighter.. but nothing special.
Right on da button nasty Ko
He's sloppy
BEAST
He got catched by a few good punches before the k.o  tho
Boots is a problem. No if, ands, or buts about it! Would love to see him get a shot at Crawford one day.
I knew Ennis was gonna win! He's to fast,  to talented! Most top dogs will stay away from this guy!!
Clubber Lane style. WOW.
Congrats. Can’t wait for your next fight.
Nice punch to the back of the head for Mr. Ennis.
That’s wussup homie.
Ennis vs Spence let's get it I got Boots
I knew this would be over quick but not that quick, Boots Is the Man I'll bet the top dogs will be keen to keep put of his way he's gonna be a Champion
SHIT ANOTHER ILLEGAL HIT ON THE BACK OFF THE HEAD I HOPE THAT HE DOESN'T SUFFER ANY FURTHER INJURY TRAUMA TO HIS BRAIN THOSE PUNCHES TO THE BACK OFF THE HEAD ARE SO DANGEROUS THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND REVIEWED BY THE BOXING COMMITTEE NOT JUST THIS FIGHT BUT ALL SHOULD FOR THE FIGHTERS HEALTH .
HIS GUNNA. BE CHAMP
Very talented .. called out ..Thurman ..spence ..ugas and Crawford the money fights I’d like to see him fight Vergil Ortiz see how he deals with Ortiz then a world title
Leave Errol Spence and Bus Crawford alone, for now. And go after Ugas because he's the weakest of the three current welterweight champions.
Behind the head 🤔
bro i literally went to go fix some food..came back and saw the ref holding his hand up
A three piece combo ended the fight!
I love boots style, but he needs to face Vergil Ortiz or get a belt before barking up the Spence and Crawford tree
Wont see a more clear punch to the back of the head than that 🤣. Refs in US boxing are a disgrace.
Ennis the best in the world ❤❤
Fight Ugas!?
They're going to be running from him.
Ilegal punch!!!!
that was straight to the back of the head though
He's good but again there putting these guys in with tomato cans! Spence will.knock him out !!! And ugas will give him a boxing lesson his power is average! Nothing special about this clown
Certified future world champ. Will probably unify. Absolute beast 👍🏻
Ennis fought a nobody so who cares, when he is faced with someone who going to take him to the limit then we will really see what he has in the tank until this is just another lame victory,so what Spence will destroy Ennis for sure.
That was behind the head. I keeps it 💯 regardless of who it is
We didn’t get to see him fight long enough and will have to wait for the next one.!!
Back of the head punch
feed him to Virgil Ortiz next if possible for Ortiz to eat him
the other dude was trash . lol
Jaron is something special. A natural.
Is it me or does he hit him clean on the back of his head at 00:05?... That should not have counted as a knockdown
This is not insane knockOut is just a regular Knockout
He walk the talk..
He hit behind the head. but he's always gonna get away when you a cheater
Thomas Dulorme threw and landed some punches after he got knocked down the 1st time. Gotta respect his heart & spirit
A proper 10 count
Terrence  Crawford vs Ennis!!!!!
He destroyed that Man. Good Lord, That’s a tuff way to make a living.
He should keep an eye on his defence
That first knock down was on the back of the head
He should fight David Avanesyan next, would be a very good test for Ennis
Is Haney and Shakur Nervous...?
He hit him behind ghr the Head. How come commentators are scared to tell the truth of what they see ?!
That shot was definitely behind the head,I would say not purposely,but definitely landed behind the head, he never recovered from that.
i want to see him against crawford !!
Boots will get hurt by Errol and Crawford. You see he gets rocked by those hook
Terence Crawford is strong in both hands switching stance wtf he talking about
Pure entertainment, Dude comes to fight and put on a show at the same time.
Back of the head mistake fallow by a lucky punch so how is this "destroying"
PHILLY!!! We needed this!! Boots really puttin on for the city! 💪🏽💪🏽
Lefty and righty? Umm... ok.
Giannis Antetokounmpo got knocked out by Tim Hardaway 😳
NOTHING TO SEE HERE !!!!!!  REMEMBER ITS BOXING       HE WILL BE DUCKED  NOTHING TO SEE HERE
All men down!!!
You tube why do you change what I write, I wrote compare
11 first round KO s is craziness.
He laid down like yup I shouldn’t be in this ring with him 🤣
Where'd they get the can from😂😂😂🤦🏾‍♂️
thats the way a referee counsel out a fighter comparte this count with the one they did on Tyson Fury
Why should he be considered good fighting this kind of opposition???? Fkn trash fighters man come on
BOOTS 🔥
Illegal shot, back of the head punch
How was the first ko scored as a knock down? Hit him clean to the back of the head
Boots ready give him top level comp!
Boots will lose to the top guy's.. he's not ready!!!.. Ortiz will crush him, Crawford will smoke him,Spence will beat him down,Danny Garcia will counter punch him with the left hook!.. Ennis is overrated!!
Boy this gone make these cats duck like daffy. Scared of the dark🤫
Does he do well vs. Spence and Crawford? Let's see the big dogs duke it out first
Impressive , some say he finished him early than Terrence , BUT that was years ago
I dont this see connor benn calling this guy
Oh my
He will be world champion I’ll bet anything on that 💯
Dayuuum Ennis ain't playing!!! Wait, how come Tyson Furry's count took forever???
That's the new punch now aim for the ear and back of the head.This guy was washed you dont get no come up for a washed bum.
Jaron Ennis = young Floyd Mayweather
Homeboy got served with a Big Mac. Then he good served with that 3 piece special at KFC!  Damn!
Okay guys help me out. That guy looks like he's a monster. How would he do against Canelo? How about Caleb Plant?
Hhhhhmmm .. Looking good! Danny Garcia and then Keith Thurman next..  I'll be convenced then!! Don't know that guy!! Looking good tho Ennis!! Keep up the good work!
Damn that dude dusted him. He looks like he could be a match for Canelo.
THAT WAS CLEARLY A HIT TO THE BACK OF THE HEAD!!!
spence will eat this kid
Dirty man back of the head  it’s dangerous
How come the reff didn't count hella slow and pause in-between the count for 5 seconds then start back where he left off?... 🤔
Just for a check
Impressive KO, but Ennis should be fighting higher level opponents.  Why are they making him fight these weaker fighters?  He's being held back.
They cloned mayweather
Clearly behind the head
Who want it!!!
He hit him in the back of the head the first time
If ennis beats or stops someone like ugas then i can see what the hype is about. Till that happens, he’s still just a prospect who beat crawford leftover.
The first shot was arguably very illegal, close to the back of the head. After that his equilibrium was completely gone, poor guy.
Jesus Loves You
They gone put some respect on his name. Someone give him some competition. A complete boxer no holes in his game great job Mr.Ennis
Let's be honest here, what did this fight prove exactly? Dulorme ain't been the same since abregu knocked him out and that was dam near 10 years ago
Dear welter weights… RUN!!!!!
Goes down for the 9th time in his career. Is this really that impressive?
Wow 47 watch out
Reason why contenders are refusing to acknowledge this man during this “Ducking” era
Sweet science. This guy is a problem for the division!
Shit is getting ridiculous. Boots needs a little work because he’s young but he’s stopping guys left and right. Give him a big fight. I need to see what he really is about.
Is he the next big thing in boxing ?
Raw skill 💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿
That looked like a shot to the back side of his head, watch in slow mo as it is pretty fast…. I’m not taking away from his win , shit happens in fights just like low blows and wearing a 40pound suit to the ring and burning out your legs. It looks like the time was a bit off and got him in the back, any how going to be nice to see this guy step up to his next challenge…
Cobbs would destroy this guy .
Boooottttsssss!!!!!!!!! Omfg this man is no hype, he the real deal
Good luck gettin anyone to fight boots. He may have to sleep 40 bums b4 he gets a shot smh🤦‍♂️
Not impressive. He gotta fight vergil ortiz and beat him then ill be impress.
That hit him in the back of the head
Boots is going to need all the help he get now trying to get a fight. He is high risk low reward  and that is the last thing you want to be in boxing.
That was a heavy hit to the back of the head. defo gonna be hugely disorientated after that!
Why is boots fighting another cab driver
Down for the" ninth time in his career" lmao
That's not Errol Spence ! Lmao
Jaron Ennis, Shakir Stevenson & Xander Zayas are the NEXT Stars of Boxing!!!
They need to pay close attention to these type of fighters.. Prichard Colon is in a vegetable state because of hitting behind the head
Poor guy got hit in the back of the head and it all went downhill from there…
Who are these Mickey Mouse 🐭 amateur style opponents !! Ennis should be embarrassed fighting these opponents. Till he gets in with Thurman, Porter ,Spence ,Crawford, or Ortiz, he will understand what are proper high level pro opponents.
That 1st punch was behind the head but boots was going to win REGARDLESS lol
I got to see bud with this switch hitter too...
Boots is the GOODS 1000% but that right hand he got caught with kind of shook him , NOW IF ERROL OR CRAWFORD HIT HIM WITH THOSE A FEW TIMES WHAT WILL HAPPEN ...🤔🤔🤔???
I wish I knew who this guy was that he just knocked out. Lol
Behind the head.... should have been called otherwise
Momma there go that man again!
Who he fight? The McDonald's employee on north street
Vergil Ortiz
How does this dude get down to 147?
Good fight for everyone
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💯💯🥊🥊  K.O
Boots gonna be y'all cash cow. No more undercards ever in life.
Boots is one hell of a fighter. I want to see him at the top but watch that first knockout in slow motion, it was in the back of the head. Not his fault, but it is what it is.
the man has no resistance, no chin, that's what happened here... something tells me Ennis is overrated
The future
This boi beats all these welterweights
He hit that man on the back of the head or is it just me who saw that??????
Ennis should fight real competition now Ugas or porter next
Uh oh Ennis is a problem
Ennis said look out for the spectacular tonight 🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊
Hit that boy with a 3 piece and a biscuit
Bootz up next! 💪🏾🥊
A Lil bit behind the head smh 🤦🏿🤣
He’s the best contender out there. Welters should be scared.
Boots Vs bud .. both are very technical fighter
Vergil vs ennis that would be sick
0:54 tough!! 💪🏾
First knockdown was behind the head.
Damn two fights ended in one round today!   This one and the Vargas fight.
🤲🏾💪🏾💪🏾✊🏾✊🏾
“Who else can switch and still have that much power”  Um….. Terence BUD Crawford! 👊💥
Spence! Crawford! Where are you? This man have something for you!
This man has tools to be world champion in multiple weight classes
Still fighting bottom feeders🤭
That hit behind the ear is deadly.  It’s what Wilder got hit with against Fury in fights 1 and 2 that completely threw off his equilibrium.
😮
Spence all them will not fight boots
Why my nigga do Giannis like that? Smh
I believe he punched the guy behind the head
It's not even the power. It's the punch placement. Ennis just lands perfectly.
Durolme quite
Ennis vs Ortiz should be next.
Who are the commentators ❤❤❤
Big hit behind the head
Boots Ennis coming fast for Crawford and Spence.
Ese golpe es ilegal....
MAN JARON BOOTS ENNIS, IS HEAVEN SENT. 1
Well to be fair, Giannis is really a basketball player, not much of a boxer.
Back of the head on that knock down. Dude wasn’t the same after that.
I wish this Ref counted for Wilder vs Fury
Dulorme has to retire and find something else to do.  He does not know how to tie up.
👏👏👏👏
"DULORME GOES DOWN FOR THE 9TH TIME IN HIS CAREER" 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Ppl tend to forget that Boots is really a 154-160 fighter that can still make weight at 147 so he takes advantage of it and his power shows...But i'm not sure that vs a true welterweight he gonna have that advantage...And what happens when the other guy is able to takes his punches...?! That was a good win but it doesn't give me much info...I wanna see him vs some1 like Thurman next
WHY IS ENNIS TAKING A CHERRY PICK AT THIS LEVEL IN HIS CAREER❓
Respect for the Greek Freak
Not a good match up from jump. Dulorme clearly quit.
This guy is gonna take over the division. Next level
I feel robbed... That was too quick Boots💥. Been waiting for a long time for a Boots fight... Only to get 1min. 🙄
He got hit in the back of the head.
🥊
Pay day he came for pay day we know that 😂😂😂. Congrats too Boots
He got hit on the back of the head 🤦🏽‍♂️ not fair
Dam giannis got k'od lol
Ennis’s speed doesn’t make sense. Omg 😱 wtf ⚡️
Dulorme didn’t want to get up
Mans 28-0 n still hasn't gotten a title shot wtf
Dulorme is way passed it, not an impressive performance 🤷🏽‍♂️
I give all boxing respect win or lose 🥊
"goes down for the  9th time of his career..." lol ... ok boots get some serious fight worthy of your skills.
Ennis is ready to fight the best, so why do they have him fighting low level opponents
Can we get Boots Ennis vs Virgil Ortiz Jr please & thanks?! Lol
Sorry but Delorme was another cherry 🍒 my guy been a stepping stone for every c lvl fighter
It was a hard hit by the ear closer to legal then not but this guy needs a bigger fighter not a habitual victim 🤣
Just need better competition he won't do Spence like that plus defense isn't impenetrable
Danger.  Dangerrrr  Get on the floor .. the villain right here  will take over boxing
🥾 Boots been a problem…i hope he get a title shot to really get in the mix…him n shakur up next!! Now watch the classic move in boxing…ignore him-downplay him-duck him🚶🏾‍♂️
He should fight Kieth Thurman next
Taki driver fight …..
Ennis The Next superstar in welterwieght
This guy might b Errol Spence Jr. krypton it’s
Boots is elite, 28-0 26KO, sick of hearing about Teofimo, Spence, Haney, etc... With this kid as under card???? Boxing is so corrupt
This guy is coming for them all
Ennis is good and all but damn it looks like he dont got a good chin ... he got wobbled there
That punch was behind the head. He couldn’t recover from that one. Boots is still one bad man tho
Bro that left came out like it was shot from a rocket 🚀   I see so much potential from an offensive approach . He’s methodical when you slow things down but in real soeed it looks chaotic   Ima keep my eye on dude cause im seeing “ IT”
This guy gonna  be a champion next yr
Saw this fight it was show.
How did he hit Dulorme so fast on that second knock down?  Even when they played it with slow motion he was able to hit Dulorme 3 times to the head and Dulorme couldn't do anything about it.  When I watched it at regular speed I wasn't able to see that he hit him 3 times.
The next floyd mayweather probably gonna be even better than Floyd just watch. 💯
No one man should have all that power! My favorite announcer now lol
That was behind. I’m just saying
Special talent
28-0, 26 KO’S… welterweights shaking in their “boots” 😎
At this point I’d like to see Ennis vs Bud Crawford Spence should fight Ugas
E got caught with two hard rights too
A litle bit behind the head yea ok 😂
😤💪🏽🔥🔥🔥🔥
The first one was illegal. For me it was a rabbit punch
Ugas better get ready.
Ennis is so damn elusive, This guy is amazing
I just hope this guy boots is  not a hype job.
This guy still fighting no good fighters
Put him in with Thurman for starters!!!
Ortiz vs boots
So back of the head is ok wtf?
Why not have prospects fight each other…it’s too many at 147
This was a mismatch. Dulorme didn’t want to get up. Boots himself got caught meaning he’s hittable/catchable . Dulorme wasn’t ready. Go on get ya couple grand you got for this fight   Dulorme and get the fuck out the ring!!!! .  I need to see boots scrap with a REAL fighter
This is why you always keep your head up along with your guard…The punch wasn’t behind the head so somebody please tell Bernstein to quit with the bullshit!🔥
Dam a good night of boxing 🥊 check out zepeda KO vs Vargas too
He just got lucky against a junior welterweight.
I wish I could have been watching boots and the zepeda fight at the same time both dudes hungry!# non-biased
Illegal punch
Ennis is definitely an elite fighter. Give this man his credit or just due. I'm ready to see him go at it wit the big dawgs of the division, he's ready or been ready.
The first knockdown was an illegal punch
Ennis is just too good. Can’t wait to see what the future holds for him. 🥊💯
Crawford errol and charlo better watch out this young brother serious business
Future star fame boxing
That's the count we needed for Tyson Fury 🤐🤐
Bruh… he did better against dulorme than Crawford.. styles make fights, and Crawford fought dulorme in 2014ish.. but damn 👀
Ennis still lackin a bit of defense, he might be a threat to Crawford. Give him Porter first and well see
Gotta like the switch hitting, right hand then left hand with the same power and speed.
Terrence and Jarod would be a real interesting fight. Battle of the switch hitters.
Dhulorme talked all that shit too lol
That was behind the head but I know it wasn’t intentional
Thats boxer is like milwaukee bucks 😂😂😂
Ennis got range idk about power we will see when he fights someone in his height class 🤣🤣
Eh not really insane. But Jaron is definitely the truth
No one answered that “who else can switch” …🤔………..uh Crawford does.
Boots vs Virgil 🙏🏽
Crawford should be first in line🤣
I apologize for thinking you were gonna k.o him in round 3. My bad bruh
The Boogie Man.   He gonna run through everyone. Fukin dominance over every fighter that steps in there. Like Floyd’s reign.
He took some big shots. Thurman would ko Ennis
Rabbit punch did dude in , he never recovered 🤦🏽‍♂️
Left & Right then left straight. Jaw & Knee connection brutal makes Dulorme's Feet looks paralyzed, Jaron E. is No. 8 Welterweight. He will definitely Jump closer to screwford.
poor chin, and poor fight vision. this happens when the fighter cant see the oppenets punches and on top of that doesnt keep their chin down
Damn
Not all that long ago, a punch to the back of the head was considered ‘illegal’. And for sound reasoning as well.   If you’re going to allow that, why not allow knives or guns?
he looks so big in there awesome
He good but Spence.... Crawford.... No! Wait.. Wait!...... Wait!
1. The Truth 2. Bud 3. One time 4. Showtime  5. Boots 6. 54 Milagros 7. Vergil 8. Swift 9. Mikey
The Frenchman 😏, has Now lost 3 fights in a row, the prior 2 being UD L's...he's 1-4-1 in his last 6 fights 😶.
boxing fans call anybody bums lol even the mfs that can box shit sad
Doesn’t help when the first shot lands behind your ear
Can somebody say rabbit punch?
Ennis vs ortiz next 😂😂
That was illigal punch back of the head.
Its a joke fight .fight jamel james
I wanna see him give Taylor a welcome to welterweight fight. I got Bootz 💪🏽🤞🏽💪🏽
At first it looked behind the head but at the other angle looked legal
Ennius is gonna be a big! It’s sucks that people will hate on him tho. And we all know why.
Ennis got caught with 2 clean punches. The first one he walked into  at 0:03.  the 2nd one at 0:36 that snapped his head. He’s lucky his opponent doesn’t have knockout power or else he gets wobbled possibly dropped.
Ennis vs Crawford or Ennis vs Spence! The world needs it!
TIME UP BUD & SPENCE.  MOVE UP OR MOVE OUT THE WAY.. NO WEAR TO HIDE  WHEN ON TOP .
Alright so on to retiring Keith
Even I can look good beating on someone’s grandma 😂another 🍒
Whoa I knew it years ago when I saw him fight. Man I'm sorry the top 3 not fighting him not because there scared or anything like that. Low reward n too risky. No point yet. Knockouts like this n he's forcing it to happen soon. Durlome ain't a bum..he's a skilled veteran. N he was stopped like he just left the amateurs.. just wow.
And what’s the name of the bum he fought?
Damn, Puerto Rico took Ls today.
Vergil ortiz stop hiding it’s time for youre time
I just had a great idea ...he should fight Virgil Ortiz next why wait AND the winner gets a shot at either Spence or Crawford
Put him in with THURMAN🤣
Future unified 147 champion
That’s a baaad maan
Jaron enis dio un golpe ilegal y peligroso
Don't chuck the ning out
Soooooo, Showtime couldn’t give us the first 53 seconds?!?!?
Beautiful left hand ✋
Is anyone ducking my boy?
He’s the whole package 😁
Jaron Ennis stops Errol Spence
Vargas in the making .. tooo green too fast. Believe the hype.
the fix was already in tbh
That first shot behind the ear took em out. By the time the second drop came he was still dizzy
Up next, Ennis vs Butaev.
Embarssing for the Latino
So wilder didn't knock out fury first and third fight after 9 seconds he called it coming up off the canvas
Boots vs Virgil Ortiz jr
What doesnt the pcb give this guy more shine. Hes hella good
Happens when u play that lame ass south paw game lol
That was a big shot behind the head you can see that clear
Bruh? Did you watch that kO by Zepeda? 😲😉😁
That 3 piece combo wit a biscuit in slow motion damn 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
Once again he looks great fighting nobody.  When will these dudes step up and quit fighting bums?
Damn!! Jaron is something else, this kid is the future of boxing.
He's only fighting pies
Al Bernstein is only their because he has Caucasian privilege facts 💯
Congrats Jaron
That was behind the head 👀
Al Bernstein knows nothing about boxing he's a culture vulture. 💯
Rabitt punch
Thurman or butaev should be his next opponent or whoever losses the crawford vs porter fight
That’s the cleanser three piece combo I’ve seen in a minute! #KnuckIfYaBuck
Would’ve liked to see ennis get more rds. Dulorme wasn’t hurt. He was groggy. Feel he’d recover if it was the end of the rd and would’ve have Bootz a brawl.  Great punch though.
This man should not be overlooked at this point
Can't wait to see Boots again. Please let him stay active and fight whoever wants it before the end of the year. Stanionis, D.Garcia, Kavaliauskas, Butaev, Broner, Abdukakhorov or Abel Ramos would be decent fights.
A knockout Artist 🥷
Still think lipinets is a bigger win than delorme but love when this dude hits the ring, ready to see him step it up again though just hope he doesn’t do the diva thing like the rest of this new gen of fighters
Another overrated guy. Cool
That hit was behind the head. disqualified
He’s like tank Errol and bud all in one
Boots might be the best welterweight and man I was a huge Vergil Ortiz fan still am but I think ennis is just that good he might be the next big thing
Dulorme was firing back but it was to much Ennis is for real
POR HABLADOR  LE PUSIERON SU GOLPIZA A JOSUE VARGAS, LO HUMILLARON  CON ESE NOCAUT EN 1 SOLO MINUTO, ARRIBA  CHON ZEPEDA 🇲🇽🇲🇽
Like ennis like dat he got him outta there but if he get hit clean like dat against any of da top guys could be problem think he should fight Ortiz den go from there no cap lol stay safe RIP Michael K Williams BLM God bless stop all dis hate checkout The Main Squeeze 🙏
Beware⚠️⚠️
Philly stand up
If this referee worked the Wilder fury fight Wilder would've been champion ...
As i expected ennis cause your one of the best and thank you for winning me some easy money against those that actually thought you would lose to Delorme lmao 🤣 smh easy money thanks ennis can't wait to see who's ass you might whip next lol
Boots a problem in the division for all the younger guys. One more year and he’s ready from the elite.
Speed,Power and all that good stuff!! Boots is a problem "not 1 man should have all that power". Solid defense,can fight left or right and dudes in his weight class are staying far away because they know he's gonna be a tough out! You can't train for Boots because he can switch his style any second! Dude is a beast! Goodluck with the rest of your career boots!
I've been saying this, Jaron Ennis beats everybody in the welterweight division... Nobody calls Boots out.. Dudes be afraid to say his name.. He's the real Boogeyman.. He can do it all.
Cool I’m bored with him though forget the names cause it’s not a lot of them out there but dude be fighting tomato cans no heart fighters just put him right in top 5 to fight someone at least b level fighters
I love boots but he has to pick up the competition.
Ennis is without a doubt a top 10 Welterweight at this point, and has the potential to dethrone one of the champions soon if not now!!!  I'm REALLY curious as to how he'd fare against Vergil Ortiz. One of these dudes should take down Crawford or Spence eventually (hoping they don't retire or move up).
The first knockdown was a hit behind the head though
Back of the head in the first knock down
Hello 147 contender that boy is not joke Be ready champions
Let the quacking begin🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆........🏃🏿‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃🏽‍♂️🏃🏿‍♂️🏃‍♂️
Hello 147 contender that boy is not joke Be ready champions
Boots is a problem
He hit him with the over hand right... And it made dog knee himself in the head 😂😂😂
He beat dulorme a lot more impressively than Crawford.
behind the head punch makes this less impressive...taking 2 clean crisp shots after the knock down shows the kid gots a nice lil chin. looking forward to Boots fighting the best.🎯🎯
Not impressed.........at all. Keep working and fight some brass. I wanna see him vs Ortiz ASAP. Too much lip wrestling in boxing nowadays.
Ennis Vs Ortiz!
I like how when the guy got dropped the commentator was like “and he goes down for the 9th time in his career” he just had that stat ready 🥴
This was an AJ hit behind the head. Should be illegal. It’s really hard to recover from this. I give Ennis props, but this is how people die in the ring.
UHHH OHHH!!! 👣other champs👣🏃‍♂️
Dulorme needs to hang it up. I remember seeing him when I was high school 7 years ago. I thought he was gonna be the next big thing. Boy was I wrong. He stay getting his ass beat
Ooh. Not throwing shade at Boots but that was a behind the head shot
That boy bad!!!!!!!!
Boots vs Ortiz stop with the talking let's fight. I guess another Latino starts his duck season.
Would like to see him fight Danny Garcia @147...
Fight Somebody !
The guy been down 9 times before this fight. How was he even fighting him
To be honest. This win is on the same level of Brook vs Crawford. Means nothing.
I read some of these comments  Yall dont knw SHIT bout BOXING Dude caught Boots twice wit good shots  Let U knw where Boots ain't been training..... Movements  Might ..... be like AB type fighter time will tell tho
Nice hard lunch behind the head... They trying to make it legal by claiming it was side of the head. But it was clearly behind the head.
That was just picture perfect. A combination boxers dream of applying
He’s ready for the top dogs !
Kid is amazing and I’m starting to think he might be the best in the division now forreal...  He might be too much for bud and Spence now...  If his chin hold up I see him out working both of them and possible tko late rounds   If this kid beats both Spence and bud and then moves up to 54 and beats charlo  My goodness the kid will have the best resume in boxing and it won’t even be close
My Favorite fighter right now! #Boots
Please give Ortiz vs Ennis!!!!!
Ennis is a Beast i had High Expectations cause of how high yall have him and he Blew them out the water . He needs one more fight for me against Thurman or Danny Garcia but i could see him beating Ugas right now
He's tough!
He's way out matched Thomas lol not even close but hey another fight under the belt
Man fight somebody and stop fighting these washes up dudes
switch hitter too
Ortiz don't want that smoke either! He can't handle that work
Spence Jr, if he ever comes back, is gonna avoid this guy just as hard as he does bud. It’s probably gonna be hard as shit for Ennis to get.a title shot cuz ain’t no one gonna want to fight him, who ever does end up fighting him is gonna have to be forced to, none will willingly, at 147.
BOOTS VS BUTEAV.  Just give the man  championship fight already . Huge statement. Boots been ready
That boy ennis bad news for any 147 fighter
Illegel hit on Dulorme, dulorme is a washed-up boxer...
He needs a real fight
Good luck against Spencer or Crawford
can't wait to see him not fight the top fighters in his prime!
Future champion 100%
Virgil Ortiz will stop him.
Insane I don’t know about all that ZEPEDAS vs big mouth Vargas way better knock out
why on earth has he not fought any of the top welter weights?
WOW WHAT HAPPEN TO GIANIS ANTETOKOMPO
Christ loves and died for you all
Wow! 👍🏾
Ugas is next
And to think that Gary Anntwaine Russell beat Boots 3 out of 4 times in the amateurs and the final time was for the welterweight spot on the US Olympic Team. Russell now fights at Jr. Welterweight and he's 15 and 0 with 15 KOs. We'll see when they clash at 147 since they are about the same age, have a history, one from Philly the other from DC, and all under Al Haymon and Showtime.
That looked like a shot behind the head, Correction, the first shot is absolutely behind the head bullshit knock down but a good stoppage.
Y’all base your opinions off of ONE fight and ONE performance. Ortiz stops Boots easy.
Dulorme has been washed up for 3 years . Not impressed at all 🤷🏻‍♂️
Boots iq and power are levels above anyone at 147
Please, give this man a title fight.
everyone looks good against low opp. then when they step up in comp its meh.
Showcase fight but Boots went about it the right way. Boots vs Speedy Rashidi Ellis......
New welterweight smoke!
I want Ennis vs Spence ASAP
Next big thing ennis.
"Order up!  3 piece Extra crispy."
He needs to fight a big name now come on
ennis vs. Virgil
Crawford is the best fighter on the planet. Ennis looked great and he's supposed to against this opponent, put him in there with Crawford and Ennis gets knocked out. Crawford would toy with him while he's throwing those bombs, softly countering while Ennis is expending unnecessary energy. After about 5 rounds of Ennis hitting and Crawford touching his body then BOOM...hard countering and open for the check hook all day.  They better not stick him in there with Crawford.......and they won't !
Vergil ortiz...
Dulormes look said it all!!!
👏
Is it me or it looks like he hits him in the back of the head.
Big names now for Ennis.
Good fight he did what he's supposed to do, KO a guy whose been down 9 times in his career. We wanna see Ennis face better competition.
This guy could fight for a title right now....and win. Is that a breech clout, a diaper, or a skirt that he wears? I'm gonna go with diaper. I love it!
Ennis vs Vergil Ortiz lets get it on
TERRENCE CRAWFORD 1:58
He punches like Errol Spence both of them would make a great fight
Dolorme need to retire kir
Please stop bringing delourme back!!! At this point this isn’t a good win.
No one beating Ennis and after this fight I fully expect fighters to now really turn down fights against him Spence and Crawford against him are 50/50 fights but I’m sorry he’ll destroy Ortiz as much as I like him also and all the new prospects I remember fans stating Eastern European and Mexican fighters run the sport now and I let ppl have they’re opinions but there is no Eastern European or any other prospect at 147-160 I see beating Ennis
There have been talks about Ortiz fighting Bud and Spence multiple times. Not once have we discussed Boots fighting Bud or Spence so how y’all gonna believe Boots is better than Vergil?
Boots looks great against D level boxers. His competition was a step down from his last fight. Boots isn't ready for EJ or Bud. He might get Ugas. That's a 50/50 fight.
caught him behind the ear, good finish
Boots better than Crawford....there I says it....don't @me son
Heavier handed boxers may cause Ennis a problem with that right hand he caught. That punch definitely got his attention
Boots is the 1
Gentlemen, I think it is too clear, that Jaron deserves a fight for a belt, enough of creating more hype for prospects, when they are already more than approved to go to a high caliber testI   know they're not going to do it, but just imagining this guy against Ortiz.... I jump off my couch jajajajaja
A fan of errol but imma say it, he might be able to be the first to beat errol spence
Boots is the business 🔥
Feed him vergil
Mexicans ..y’all still think Ortiz will kill ennis?
Thomas who?!?
Stay away Crawford & Spence
Unintentional punch behind the head started all the problems
Back of the head. No call
This man is ready!
Dude coming for that title shot
Ennis beats Crawford!!!! And definitely gives Spence a run for his money and I’m a Spence fan…
First time seeing Ennis.great talent
Spence should fight this guy on his come back
My boy Virgil better go in the hyperbolic time chamber this guy boots is a monster
Weak azz opponent!
Good stoppage, but it doesn't really tell us that much about how good Ennis can be
Ennis looked so good.
Ennis is not to be played with at all.
Rabbit punch and it was over.
This is one of my favorite fighters!!
Just let him fight UGAS
It strayed behind the head he turned his head so he wouldn’t get punched in the face!! Punch was on target he moved!
Now that is a perfect example of a totally aware ref doing his job!
He's good doing that against a washed up fighter. Delorme has been bad for a while now. I'd like to see him fight Devin Haney or Ryan Garcia, but neither of them want that smoke. So he'll just have to be ducked for the next two or three years until he becomes viable, that is to say, unavoidable.  Hopefully against Teófimo. 50/50 fight that is.
Hindi manlang pinag pawisan si ennis
Ennis smashes ortiz like how shakur smashes oscar valpeds and tank smashes hypejobchenko.
Dude is monster future king of welterweight
Boots vs Vergil Ortiz let's go
His tittle shot coming next year. He ranking is surprisingly high based off skill not resume. So Spence Ugas and crawford will have no other choice. Most likely Ugas should be next
This dude is something  special..he will be champion in his next fight ..he can fight both southpaw or orthodox ..he have the power he got all the skills but he need to watch the fight and sharp up  the defense cuz he got hit 2 or 3 good shot ..maybe he know his chin solid but againts crawford u cant do that but he is my new favorite fighter!!
vergil ortiz vs ennis
The ppl he been fighting
Video was playing fast for me
Boots just screwed himself…he will be ducked from here on 😂
I think Ortiz guys way harder than this guy n is better IMO.
Damn I was watching zepeda vs Vargas because I thought it would be more competitive and after it ended in the first round I hopped to see the Ennis fight and it was already over as well.
Still don’t think he can beat Crawford but who knows this boxing
Rabbit punch all the way
He ate those two powerful shots like no problem! Still tighten up on that! I know you learned from that! But dam what a chin!!
BOOTS IS DEFINITELY THE HARDEST-PUNCHING WELTERWEIGHT RIGHT NOW.. AND I'VE MENTIONED THIS 2 YEAR'S AGO.. HE'S JUST NOT THE MOST PROVEN AT 147.LBS! NEVERTHELESS, HE HAS AN OVERALL GREAT SKILL-SET.. WITH SPEED, COMBINATION-PUNCHING, ANGLES, REFLEXES, FOOT-WORK, OFFENSE/DEFENSE, SERIOUS SWITCH-HITTER.. AND IS A DEVASTATING POWER-PUNCHER AT WELTERWEIGHT! BRING ON ORTIZ, THURMAN, UGAS, OR CRAWFORD/PORTER.. HE'S A DANGEROUS MAN..👌🏽💪🏽😏🥊💯
That's why none of the Champs mention his name. Boots is probably the best offensive fighter in the current crop.
Ennis vs Ortiz gotta happen next year 🥊🥊🥊
Lol Ennis beats up another D level fighter.
Vergil Ortiz don’t want that smoke
Virgil vs Boots
Giannis antetokoumnpo lost by K. O
Congrat Jaron congrat 🏆
Good match also for V. Ortiz.
Still levels to the game. He need a better test. The elite want go for this lil stuff trust. He need some more experience.
Future champ rit here boots different ask Magic
I was expecting for 5-7 rounds to see Ennis skill but it's only 1 round🤦‍♂️
🤣 Dontae boxing nation was right! He said when a black fighter wins check the comments you'll see hate and racist... Then he said check the comments when a Mexican fighter wins and how we give respect and credit... Damn. He was spot on!
Commentator " he was hit behind the head and it was a little so it wasn't illegal" LMAO boxing is trash allowing behind the head punches. Behind the head punches should be treated as low blow and give the boxer 5 minutes to recover if neccessary.
Boots is Number 2 behind Errol
Only Vergil , Spence Nd Crawford can stop this man right now I hope they stop him before he gets even better
Canelo alvarez vs Ennis Fight of the year. If this happens
Look at that fucking speed. His hand speed is insane combined with his power. He is destined to become welterweight champion. Errol and Crawford are shaking right now.
I'm been following the kid since the beginning. I've been say this all along he is special. This kid is a phenom.  Everyone will be watching going forward, even the haters!!
Punk ass Spence going to sleep 😴
That's a clearly behind-the-head shot, but Ennis wasn't wrong. Dulomore was ducking too low. What a fighter Ennis is. Take Spence!
Ennis is so dynamic that the power becomes very stunning to fighters. I'm guessing the short list of guys willing to face him got much shorter tonight. That angle that he threw the shot at for the 1st knockdown was lethal. Not many fighters even throw shots in that manner to catch a guy ducking like that.
Whew🥊
Philly stand up boots u next bro 💯💯
That first knockdown was so fast lol. I looked down at my phone for a quick second and dude was on the mat lol. Him and Spence would be a hell if a fight.
Camden gives Philly a big shoutout! Way to go Boots! Bring them all on!!
Dam ennis ate that punch came back with 3 punch combo. Nice
I like Boots but he fighting Journeymen.. After Porter take the L from Crawford.. he can fight Gate Keeper Porter
I wonder if Keith run 🏃‍♂️time Thurman still hasn't heard of him and doesn't know who he is
That was Beautiful!
Boots hit him in the back of the head on the first knockdown.
What a beast !!!
Basic for Crawford
We all know Boots will OBLITERATE Spence in 4 rounds, Right?
Crawford will fight him in 2040! Can’t wait
Ain’t nobody fighting this shit man... too dangerous
Wow he knock out a guy that’s been down 9 times 🔥 🔥🔥🔥
Jaron Ennis vs Vergil Ortiz would a 🔥 matchup!
Ennis A Problem For Everyone At 147
The top dogs beware Jaron Boots ennis is coming for your crown 🤴
Nike just sold out of track shoes...the entire division running fast 🏃‍♂️💨 from the Boots Ennis fight 🤣😅
EIMANTAS STANIONIS, Egidijus Kavaliauskas, or Alexander Besputin next please. I love Boots but I need to see him against a true Welterweight and not a former 140 lber like Dulorme and Lipents.
This is the 3rd Time Delorme has been KO'd 😂😂😂 Y'all Fanboys are Dumb as hell 💯
Bull chit STRAIGHT RABBIT HIT F THAT REF
It wasn't a night for Puerto Rico, Dulorme and Vargas both stopped in the 1st round...
He needs a title shot
Ennis is killing bud crawford, he aint talking about ennis tho he know what time it is
Looks like a punch in the back of the head he should of been disqualified
Don’t run when that Thurman contract comes in bootie
Vao
Damn the welterweight division is hot af
Hasnt fought any one elite . Wait till he gets tested like all them fighters that think they good them learn a huge life lesson then go bye bye never hear of them again lmao
It's hard to recover from that punch behind the head
Another TOMATO and CHERRY season, for Boots Ennis 😀😀
He not ready for Errol he can beat everybody else he just need to tighten up on getting hit in his chin cause he been gettin hit a lot in the chin when he do good and if Errol hit him he going to sleep fr
Dulmore deserved a bit more time. He was right there ready to unleash on him!
Boots vs Crawford🥊Porter* November match winner  👍💯🥊. Who's gonna be the last man standing with that wbo 🏆 title 🤔
Ennis is too BIG. . . lol He is like a natural 168
Vergil callin out bud and jaron callin out Spence . These kids want that smoke fuck that light weight division full of tweets these two do not get enough respect runnin all fades respect both
Influence by canelo
Philly all day
Jaron is a beast
😏💯
Ennis Who?   Please Yall,   Bud Crawford  Will Make This Man Look Foolish...( Don't Believe The Hype)   Who Ever Disagree With Me,  Come On,  Let's Bet.    "August"
The whole fight was a first round highlight, less than 4 minutes, with 1 knockdown and 1 K.O. insane! 😳 bring on Spence, Thurman, Crawford, Ortiz, Ugas, etc.
Back of the head shot.... made a shot fighter, look really shot. Dang, dulorme gonna have to find a power line for the boxing boots. Hang'm up bro.
This guy is the next superstar in boxing he's different
The New superstar of weltherweight!
Boots different
Durlome got heart, much respect. Ennis is solid
Against who though
"No one man should have all that power!" Mauro got the knowledge!!!!
Ennis vs ortiz
Stiffened his ass
F that if that’s not an ilegal shot, then nothing is.
That behind the head shot was dangerous, we saw what happened to Prichard Colón with those type of shots..
Boots hands fastest I seen in a while. He got like Gary russle speed or maybe even Rjj
Another fake ko
Illegal punch
Mr. Catch a Body strikes again! Where is Vergil Ortiz Jr at?
He's the real deal I've liked boots since he was in the ametures, he's turning out very well. Much respect to his pops too !!
Keith is getting left behind not being active
Future P4P #1. Believe that.
Boots the new #TBE  @147 Forget about Crawford and Spence
Who want it next?
Boots one of the best fighters in the world soon to be PfP #1
Virgin don't stand a chance with this guy.....yall ready to feed him to the wolves
Ennis is fighting nobodies
Vergil Ortiz would beat him. Then take on Bud, ESJ, or Shawn
Who!?!?
Nobody at 147 is going to beat Jaron Boots Ennis they're going to continue to duck this man
Boots vs Spence next 🔥🔥
Crawford destroys him
Jose Zepeda ko of Vargas was more devastating
ennis vs ortiz  will a good match
We all know he is not ready for that errol power.
Back of head punch obviously.
All the people calling for ORTIZ is too funny. They not about to put a slow footed 1 dimensional fighter in their against a switch hitting athletic guy. ROBERT GARCIA already said 4 yrs before that fight what that tell you. It would be EASY WORK for BOOTS
Rest in peace grandma 👵 🙏 😔 💔 😢
Bring on Ortiz
Hats off to boots but dulorme is nothing special
Boot 🥾  is a problem  at 147 Philadelphia monster
Very impressive. He won easy. Completely outclassed the guy.
Wipe out puerto rican today lol  Strong boxers But weak chins  Realtalk lol
Ennis looked amazing that first round:)
Next one up after Terence Crawford
Rabbit punch against a step down in competition lol
First knock down was definitely behind the head
I got Boots over all current welterweights. He just different.  Salute
In a few years what! Boots is ready now ain't nobody in the 147 class beating him hands down period,  it can be Spence, Crawford, porter and who ever think they are ready for him, he's a beast fasshow
Another Philly fighter
They couldn’t find a better opponent??? Wow 😮 this really needs to stop 🛑 in boxing match making.
Ennis vs Ortiz Jr
MAN is Amazing
Juego sucio golpe de conejo
So many behind the ear punches in boxing nowadays. It's illegal for a reason.
The takeover begins
spence and crawford gonna whoop dat ass but I like ennis he fast we still don't kno how tough he is thou
IM A VERGIL FAN BUT AFTER WATCHING THIS ...VERGIL WILL GET KNOCKED OUT IN LESS THAN 5 ROUNDS... ENNIS IS TOO POWERFULL AND TOO BIG FOR 147
It looked like a 10th round finish. In 1 round. 🤜🏿Boots🤛🏿
Omg this dude Ennis is dangerous no wonder it has being 15 fighters didn't want to fight  him. This guy is for real. Mark my words he will be a world  champion  soon than what u think.
That’s the dude canelo been sparring
Virgil Ortiz wins
He not to fight real Competition this chups his been finding ain’t gonna cut it no more
Ortiz would win
i called it a day ago.
Some great fights and knockouts all across boxing today wow
El primer golpes fue en la nunca, no mamen
This guy got a soft chin
That first K.O was an illegal hit to the back of the head
Damn Spence can’t hide anymore either bud or this guy I like this guy boots
Young Roy!
*Terence got his work cut out for him. In a few years we gonna be talking about what Boots woulda did vs Floyd. 👀*
The talent in boxing right now is arguably the best it's ever been
He’s Hungry one of the champs gotta fight him
Nasty
HIS READY COME ON THIS KID IS NO JOKE
He got hit behind the ear...smh
Thanks you!  There's no way Boots should be an undercard. Dude is box office!
Illegal shot
1st KO was an illegal punch, behind the head.
Man that punch was behind the head
He making statements like spence was 😳😳😳
Jaron been ready. Boots called out all the top welterweights the only person who respond its on YouTube is Errol. I would like to see that fight. Bud could also give him that smoke back
Reff counting kinda fast tho
💯
Behind the head.
JARON "BUTT" ENNIS NOT FIGHTING NOBODY
Perfect fighter, he knocked him down once as orthodox then knocked him down & out as southpaw. Errol better stay tf away
Ennis vs Virgil Virgil Ortiz should be next but Virgil already ducked Crawford so I doubt he man enough to fight Ennis
HE CALLING OUT ERROL HE NOT READY FOR THAT FIGHT MAN
He beat a modern day gamboa . Like really been dropped 9 times. That’s like gervonta fighting gamboa who’s been dropped 14 time in his career.
Vergil got more pop but Boots got more skills I’ll take him in 12 vs Ortiz
Which did the ref just jump to ten after 9? That wasn't a full second inbetween?
Illegal shot oh kind of legal that's why I watch fights muted  .
Ennis KOs Spence’s puzzy ass
Lmaooo whoa wtf did I just watch⁉️...Boots legit just smoked that boi so easily, my goodness 🤯
The biggest problem boots has now is getting fights. 15 people said no I know you see why. I want to see boots against bud or Spence or Thurman it doesn't matter. Too Young too Strong great footwork power in both hands. It will be nice AV brakes the Charlos  face too when he goes up and wait his body frame won't let him stay out this week for long.
JARON BOOTS ENNIS vs Danny Garcia Next
Boots is a savage
Great win and explosiveness 💯💪
Nothing impossible DULORME is Real Ready Losser That's why Ennis Easy beat him Thomas DULORME
Damn
He kills ortiz
Spence and Crawford in trouble. All those belts comin back to Philly.
I love it. But if y’all seen what I seen, he might not be ready for 1 and 2 yet.
Give me Ennis vs Ortiz NOW!!!!
I don't see any of the top guys beating ennis.
Vergil Ortiz vs Ennis make it happen 🔥🔥🔥
Boots vs Vergil Ortiz
Not one man should have all that power. Incredible commentator.
Dats da Man right Cheer!!!! Future champ 💯
Ennis beats Bud and Spence in my opinion
Ennis Is a beast
Before the KO he landed a clean shot on Ennis. Gotta fix that don’t get too sloppy and baited into being floored.
Him and shakur are next up
*Jaron Ennis vs Vergil Ortiz, Stanionis, or C.Benn*
He's coming for that   👑
Different breed😮😮😳😳
REAL DEAL Ilike Holyfield
Down for the ninth time in his career? Of course he was gone knock him out
🥾🥾🥾🥾🥾🥾🥾
