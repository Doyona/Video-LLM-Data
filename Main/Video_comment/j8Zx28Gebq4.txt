You already Know how much you mean to me! Thank You!
2025 and I still wish she'd sell volume 1 again
When my daughter got a hold of my Tati pallet my heart completely broke and I seriously cried over makeup for the first time ever. I tried to salvage what I could but it still hurts the soul.😢😢
I love your make up here. I mean, l love it always, but this one..l like the most  And yes (omg, Tati, you've been through so so much). I am glad you are creative once again ❤  Kisses
I never got buy the pallate cuz I was too young and now that I can she is discontinued I really wanted the volume 1 palate so bad. I think about it to this day.
Where was this product found or sold on ? I'm not a blues type person so I will not buy it however I was just curious
So ARE more products coming ? I guess not 🤔😣😢
Her videos have like 15+ ads 💀💀💀
The tati beauty is my absolute favorite palette I'm so sad to not get more 😭
I really hope one day Tati brings back her eyeshadows. They are the best in the game. I have tried everything from drugstore to luxury and hers were the best ever.
U can tell she was lying she knows that Pallet was approved that’s why she did a professional photo shoot somebody made all that money
Babe, what lashes are you wearing here? Your makeup looks phenomenal!
The second palette that would have launched is literally my dream. I complain all the time that I can’t find green eyeshadows that aren’t neon and navy eyeshadows that are slept on. I hope one day you are able to launch something like this :(
Every time I hear Tati Beauty ... I want to cry 😭😭😭😭   I just want to buy volume 1
I loved the textured neutrals palette but was hoping that you would come out with a cooler tone version that I could wear. It's heartbreaking to hear that it was in the works but will not be coming out.
What foundation are you wearing ??😍
I was curious and took a look… found it being sold for $175 on ebay, $50 on Poshmark, and on Etsy.  Unbelievable!
My Vol. 1 is my favorite palette to work with still! I use it sparingly and only for  special events. 💜
Please I beg of you make cosmetics again your beauty products were so different and high quality everything on market is feeling like the same thing re packaged. Please don't give up if not for you for us. I never got to have any of the items you sold but would love to purchase what you would possibly make in the future. So sorry this happened to you, thank you for clarification.
Tati I need a blendiful to obviously blend my makeup! The holy grail even better than any beauty blender….. please at least sell them
That purple shade is EVERYTHING!! It is SO gorgeous and if Tati ever releases that palette I'd buy it for that shade alone! I wasn't a huge fan of all the other shades I saw but OH MY that purple!! I am a massive makeup fan but I still don't know how to do eye looks but I want to learn it SO badly, the problem I have besides not having any faith or patience in myself is that I also struggle with eczema around my eyes and to learn eye looks means to do them over and over washing them off and doing it again and that just irritates the eczema so bad that I'll get a flare up that'll stay for days afterwards until my creams bring it down again so I don't even know how to practice, my point is that I bought Tati's palette when it came out and I haven't used it once! I've swatched some of the shades but never actually used it but even when everyone started selling their palettes for loads of money, even used ones I still did not want to sell mine because I always thought one day I'll learn how to do it right and I'll want to use that palette when that time comes!! I probably have like 30 palettes all more or less unused because I just don't know how to use eyeshadow but I still LOVE makeup and I love buying palettes!!
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 I am heartbroken!! I don't know what to do, I lost my palette and didn't know that your brand closed down 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Gorgeous
I hope and pray she'll be able to relaunch her brand and make amazing makeup again. <3
100% would have bought that
I’m so sad that this palette won’t be available to us. Your volume 1 palette is amazing and I can only imagine how perfect volume 2 would be. Love you Tati! ❤️
Prob one of my most favorite palettes ever! (vol 1 that is) I absolutely love it! The colors were so flattering for everyone. I had always hoped for a Vol 2.
Tati. We need this.
I would have loved this so so much!!!!!
I love your products!!! I feel so sad and sick that someone or people could do that to you or anyone! That’s awful! God Bless! You stay YOU! You go and keep doing what you do best! We love you no matter what! ❤️
Are you launching it or not?
Can you do a "dupe the vibes" for similar colors products by others that are tati approved? I actually think the color story is fun!
I'd love you to make mini palettes with the formula declination but of only one color so we can collect them and take them on holidays etc because I love your palette but it's too big to travel with :(
I saw a channel by a makeup guru and like 195 voted your palette as the number 1 palette of all time.  ... it's very very sad your no longer selling it .... :(
This is so sad 😭😭 Would love to own this palette💯 😥🔥🔥💝❤
I really really hope that one day you revive Tati Beauty... It was really a brand of a kind, and I still hope to one day see the neutrals vol. 2 and all the great things you had in store for us...
Your volume 1 is the greatest palette I own. Please launch this palette it's so gorgeous OMG 🥰💖
Oh please make your first neutral eyeshadow again! I want that palette so bad but i dont have enough money at that time but now it was discontinued.. 😭
This palette would sell great even now… it’s very much Euphoria vibes ! 🦋
9 mins later.....
Tati your new palette is amazing…
Tati are you not allowed to just take your ideas and move forward with staring a new company by yourself? I'm so curious because it seems like they could never own all your ideas and it just so wring what has been done to you. Sending you prayers and well wishes
This makes me so sad yet also so grateful that I randomly ordered volume 1ONE DAY before you posted to your video and shut down the website. It's my favorite palette out of the 100 I have..  I'm very careful with it as I know that it's possible that I got the last Tati beauty palate or at least one of the last ones that you sent out.   I'm so proud of you for persevering and living your best.. One day hopefully we'll see volume 2 and enchanted textures or some version!💜💜💜
Would have loved to see a step by step guide to this look right here, its goals 🙌
OMG I hope you relaunch!  I love your pallet and that second edition looks beautiful!!
Sorry to hear. God bless
I love when I can hear the references to deliverance in your words now. Praying one day, when the Lord leads you to, you will share your testimony of being delivered out of new age and witchcraft. Praise God.
So Tati, I’ve been searching for your blendifuls and this might answer my question. Can I not purchase those anywhere?
I never got the chance to buy the volume 1 and I’m heartbroken because when it was launched I thought wow that would a beautiful pallet for a bride makeup look and now I’m getting married July 2nd and I don’t have it. Ugh makes me so sad 😭
I would have LIVED for that collection!!! That’s ok though, I know you have way more up your sleeve 😉 We will all be here waiting for the next true launch! 🎉😊💜🦋
I'm just wondering why you can't start a new business to implement all these creative ideas? Or rather than doing it by yourself, maybe doing it under a reputable company? That enchanted palette looks beautiful. I regret not buying your neutrals palette, I had it in my basket several times but I couldn't justify buying more eyeshadow at the time.
So like J.S...Tati please!
I really wish this palette got released. I love it sooooo much.
I can’t believe someone is actually selling something with your name on it. Although it’s beautiful I won’t buy it and support whoever it is that stole it. Hopefully you’ll be able to create again…and when you do I’m here for it ♥️
Tati I’m heartbroken that you have to go through this theft of your palette, we would have loved it! Nothing compares to yours, any ideas on substitutes for either palettes? Thank you for such beautiful products, love my Halo!!!
That was so heartbreaking to watch but I hope you can make colorful pallets in the near future and don't let anybody take that dream away from you of what you're wanting to achieve I'm still trying to find your first palette and it was already gone before I had a chance to get it and it'd be nice for you to make pallets again to be able to purchase one and this just sucks that this happened to you that's just awful and I hope you just keep moving forward.
I TOTALLY envisioned your coffee table books also having real photographs of you and your models wearing as many looks and combinations of your eye palettes as possible to inspire your customers 🥹
I lost my first Tati palette, so I bought another. When I moved I found my first one!!! Im soooo grateful to have 2 now!!!!  Going to treasure them for a long time. 🙏🥰🤗❤️
The Tati palette is my favorite of all time. Nothing compares to the glitters. I’m sad we will never get this second one. It was a beautiful color story. I definitely would have bought it.
i thinks no one cares enough to make a video about it! Doesn't surprise me tho!
I don't know why I got this emotional, but I'm so happy you told me this happened to you ❤️ I would've definitely bought the pallette, and I'm picky when it comes to colors 🎨 I have no doubt in my mind that you will succeed greatly again - you are a great creator 💃🏻🥳🤩 Keep going, Tati, I'm waiting for you 😃🥰 Love from Norway 🇳🇴 (and a proud Volume 1 owner) 😁
I’m absolutely gutted for you, textured neutrals is my favourite palette I don’t use it much as I don’t want to finish it as have already hit pan on some shades but it’s just stunning and the formula is incredible. Can’t wait for you to create again this palette would have been amazing! Sending you hugs and love 🫶🫶🫶🫶
So happy you're here honey!!!!
My thoughts are with you. You are stronger and wiser now. You will create new and better ones on your very own🦋🍀🦋🍀🦋🍀🌈🌈🌈
That was a dream pallet even for us.
Please creat more makeup u gave me self worth n hope n I love love love ur makeup never owned it tho I hope I get to soon stage four cancer love ya tatti
I hope you get Justice on this investigation. ❤️
The Tati Beauty Palette....the best eyeshadow palette I've ever owned. I'm almost out of all the shadows and it breaks my heart. So glad you've come out on the otherside. Still holding out for hope that we'll get more products down the road.
Can we get volume 1 again? I so loved it but could not get my hands on it. If you could put that in stock again or something it would be great
Too bad I never got my hands on beauty blender from Tati.
It killed me that the palette cost $100 CAD with shipping and everything all in, but I am SO glad I purchased it when I had the chance. It’s the one makeup item I have had trouble purging, even though I know it’s probably expired now. I still love using the glitters - to this day I have not found any better! 💔
When you choose to start your next venture I will be there with you!
New make up line please 🙏
Lord this just rambled on forever. Sorry love Tati but this was completely a waste of time. Ugh 😣
Bring back tati beauty!!!! :(
Stop talking already.  How can I get one of these???
That’s too bad. Tati is a wonderful creator. This is heartbreaking for fans. I’m sad that bad decisions were made and everyone loses here. I still take the supplements daily since they are so effective; good job Tati. The first pallet was too warm for me and i was holding out for the next. I fear the day Halo closes, too. Until then I’ll wear my viseart shadows and have better skin with kiwi and better health with her multi. Xoxo.
I missed out on the first pallet and would have bought this one if you had released it. It's not right that someone stole those and is selling them. I hope they find whomever it is
Come on tati We are all here waiting for tati beauty to come back to life Why are we waitinggggggg HAHAHH
I love you Tati! You are so adorable and I am literally chomping at the bit for a new palette! Your first one is one of my favorite ever!
Ok first of you are gorgeous! And I’m little sad about this Tati beauty ! 😭😭
You’re pallet was actually my favorite pallet to this date! I just can only hope that you will bring out more pallets in the future! ❤️
Tati, this "new chapter" in your life looks so beautiful on you,!! You are literally shining from the inside out and I am so happy for you!!!!! XO ❤️😘👑 And those colors in your "almost pallet" are so beautiful 😭  P. S. I am so glad you love Texas!! The amount and quality of house you can get in TX far exceeds Cali!! 👍🏻
If approved, I would definitively have bought it as I LOVED the first one !
😊
Ur putting people to sleep! Such a long intro.
Omg I never got my hands on the first eyeshadow palette and I regret it.
Bless your heart girl! you are simply amazing! We are so thankful you came back to share your life and beauty knowledge with us!
I have your first collection and the bledifuls.  Love them both.  If you have another launch, I will certainly purchase.  Great quality and beautiful colors.
This made me so excited and so sad so fast. I've hit pan in every color of volume 1 minus the black. Her formula is everything. I hope one day she brings her formulas back. I use the volume 1 everyday and soon it's gonna be gone.
Hi Tati! Random question where can I get something similar to your blendiful makeup applier? I bought the one you created and absolutely loved it!
OMG YESSSS! Tati I need like ten more of your old palette and ten of the new one ❤️❤️
Your pallet is amazing! I pray you create something again!
What makeup products have you used here? Please your skin looks the best. Answer meeeee
This hurts my soul that this was stolen from u. I know without a doubt whatever u create next will be even better. Such a beautiful color story. Much love.
LOVE YOU TATI!!!
the Tati I loved to watch is back and I am so happy to see you again.
Me still holding out hope you will do another brand or collab in the future 🤞
Why wasn't this pallet approved?
So... Can she like never make makeup again or? Like I guess I'm confused about why she can't have tati beauty anymore
Poor tati man. She can't catch a damn break
We’re still here with you Tats!
I really wish I was able to get the OG pallet
I hope someday you can bring this all back. Your formula is amazing. I still am regularly using the original palette!
How would anyone get their hands on your prototype to sell it??
Omg what?! I actually didn't know that tati beauty was no more. That palette is my go to and I've been looking forward to the next one 😭😭😭
You’re absolutely stunning Tati! Your hair and makeup are beautiful! Can you please do a video on both?  Love your channel and content.
Don’t give up! I hope that in the future you can do your thing again!
I hope you come back with your Cosmetics. Hopefully you can come back and take it back. Sad those who where involved did that to you.
We love Tati!! She is literally the best makeup artist to follow. So glad to have you back! I was on edge the whole time when you were saying you were growing something inside and you aren’t done “growing” bc I really hoped you were going to announce 🤰🏻🤞🏼  I still hope its true. Hope you’re finally able to fulfill that last dream of yours! ❤️❤️❤️
Is there any possibility of Tati Beauty coming back some day? It's unfortunate that your brand was caught up in disaster after disaster but in all truth, it's a damn good brand. Makeup lovers deserve a chance to experience it. It is caught up in legal issues now, but that doesn't mean the end. Please don't give up.
I would totally buy that palette. Love those colors. Maybe one day you can make that happen.
@tati 😖😩😢😭 I’m so upset that this beautiful palette did not launch! It would have looked beautiful next to the Volume 1 palette. The colors story was sooo beautiful and the packaging was beautiful refined. I pray sometime in the future that you will be able to create makeup under your own brand again.
Too talky
Beef is at 12 minutes 😘
I hope you will bring out lipproducts, in all pretty colours. Also available in EU,   I missed you🥰
I’m never buying your palette from anywhere but your site or unless if was announced by you that its carried in specific stores 💞
@Tati. did you watch the "Not so pretty" series? must watch for makeup lovers
But if this was just a test and proto type and was not ready to selling, why did she make so many then?
does someone know a website where they can help you buy stuff that doesn't ship to certain country? I'm trying to get my hands on some halo beauty product but my country doesn't show up. then this showed up makes me want to be ready to be able to purchase this 😂 I don't trust people reselling items on online shopping platforms. I'm that kind that only buys from the official website.
Tati! You have to try the new improved Revelon Colorstay eyeshadows! They are pigmented creamy goodness!!
Girl, your Tati beauty pallet is my favorite one! Please bring back your brand, call it whatever :D i will buy your pallets cause they are so DIFFERENT and awesome quality :)
This is the weirdest video I have ever watched
I need the beauty blender pad things  seriously the best.
she actually gets to the business @ 12 mins for anyone who wants to know.
The first pallet was the best pallet hands down to hit the market!! I am so happy I was able to get my hands on it, especially because I never buy from websites I can’t walk into a stand alone store and return in case I don’t like it. It was so beautiful, I will keep it forever.
😫😫😫😫 omg those COLORS! I have the textured neutrals and ADORE it. I was honestly waiting for you to come out with the PERFECT purple since you always look for a good one. Looks like you were on top of it! I’m so sad that dream had to go on pause Tati. It’s so good to see you loving it here in Texas! You’ll have to tell us how you liked your first bluebonnet season! I know for me it was so beautiful it took me off guard! Still love ya! Can’t wait to see what you come up with next!
🙄
I still wish I could buy the blendiful :( missing it like crazy
Is there no way this could still be a thing?  All that hardwork....gone
I just used your pallet for prom last week and I am planning on using it again this next week for prom! It is still my all time product!
I was never able to get the first palette 🥺
I have the first pallet and it is AMAZING Its my FAVORITE  and I legit don’t use any other eyeshadow pallet!  I constantly receive compliments!
Bummed that you were going to make a cool toned palette. I saw Vol 1 and immediately thought I'd snatch it up if it was cool toned. I can't imagine having my work stolen like that. I have no doubt you'll be on the up and up makeup wise soon
My Volume 1 stays put away because I know I can never replace it. I’ve used it twice. Very lightly. (Thank you pigment!) It was impossible to ever order another, and my Blendiful I won’t even open because I just feel like they were investments into beauty that I needed to cherish. That color story for Enchanted was beautiful and I’m sad I will never get to own it. I hope all this positivity in your life brings it back for you Tati, especially being here in Texas! We are so happy to have you! I am forever going to be a fan and will follow you hoping to see you create once again!
This makeup makes you look younger Tati. It looks nice on u
Volume 1 is and was one of my favorite palettes and I am sadly trying to find similar products but nothing has been as great. You are so talented and lovely-and I’ll be right here patiently waiting for your next adventure! Thanks so much for sharing with us!
Do what you love to do! Don't let anyone stand in your way, girl! XXX
Please for sure never stop creating!
I love you and I’ve loved your products. I’m sorry this happened. I really hope I can buy another pallet from you one day ❤️
I watched for 5 minutes and still don't know what you are talking about.
Your hair is beautiful and looks so healthy
I still love my Tati palette, I am so bummed I can't get vol. 2 from Tati Beauty.
It looks like a Morphe pallet 🤷🏻‍♀️
She needs money
This makes me so mad your baby was stolen from you
I really hope you relaunch your brand ❤️❤️❤️
I would have bought every pallette.  I loved the formula so much.
I love you so much Tati your real! Such a sweet girl!!! I’m obsessed nearly through my first pallet 😢 you worked so hard 😢
I have the first Tati palette and love it and I cherish it because the formula is amazing, I am glad I own it, I pray that all things good come to you, thanks for sharing
I know your Vol. 1 isn’t sold anymore but for those of us who have it, would you be able to do some looks with your pallete?  Everyday look, night look, going out look, etc.
I hope it comes back because I never got the 1st one..
Wait what happened to the other video I was coming to finish it.
12:05  This is so nostalgic! Tati, when I saw you holding the Tati Beauty textured neutrals vol 1, I knew by the moment that I need that in my hands... as a student it was tough for me still I spent all my festive money to buy it! And I can't be more proud till the day holding the palette! Because as a makeup-lover, I know I am holding something best that makeup industry could offer! So this moment at 12:05 kinda makes me overwhelmed cause I want to feel the joy again! But it has to be approved by you! Idk lets see rest of the video
Your hair is stunning.  Wow.  I know that's a shallow comment for the seriousness of this vid but I had to let u know.  Sorry this happened to you I truly hope you start a new Tati Beauty,.
I feel immense sadness that it didn’t come to fruition. Where you were going was exactly what I love. Whimsical. Fun. Light. Ugh.
I love my tati beauty pallets. I don’t want to use it up bc I can’t get another one
If she's OK to share, I would absolutely wanna see Erika on her special day!
So sorry this happened. Good for you defending yourself. 💜
I'm so bummed out I never got a chance to purchase any of your palettes. I'm sure there are better things for you on the horizon.
You are amazing, Tati!! I will forever be a fan and support you! Thank you for sharing your truth.
Love you! Still have my vol 1 palette and use it whenever I do my makeup! I NEED that volume 2 of the cool tones!!!! I was so sad to hear that Tati Beauty dissolved. Love your products!!
My volume 1 is my favorite pallets 😭
If the product wasn't approved, why were the pallets even produced?
Tati you are amazing! I have been watching your channel for like 8 years. You are a huge inspiration to me and I look up to you so much, because you are such a badass business woman. I want to buy everything you mentioned. I really hope that you start a new company one day. I am a graduating business student and I don’t have a lot of experience yet, but you seem like some one who has the potential to become really successful, because you do what you love with so much passion. You deserve it and we all want it!!
12:06
Thank you for being alive ✨️
Tati that palette us stunning i am so proud of you it great to see you glowing again:)
I cherish my Volume 1 palette. I hope I never run out 😭
Hello Tati. We are waiting for a second pallet ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😘
I’m so glad I splurged and purchased the first pallet. I use it very sparingly so it will last. I hope you one day are able to release more!
Not again....do i want continue watching?
When can we have James
I pray you would bring it back, it is by far the BEST palette I own :(
Welcome to Texas.  We rock!
Can we see what the cover art would have been?
I would have loved this pallette, Textured Neutrals is still something I use a lot.
Your glowing more than ever.
Plz come back with ur brand and one more time ,,now u will not start from the scratch ,,but with experience ,,i wasn’t able to get my hands on any of your makeup ,,but I thought I would in future ,,and my fingers are crossed ,,iam going to buy them one day ,,coz i know iam going to ,,eyeshadows will be my first purchase
I think you're so strong, to be able to talk about this, which shows you are in a better place and at a higher level now. Your resilience inspires me always. xo
if you were planning to destroy them and place into landfill, id much rather these people find and sell them and have them actually get some sort of use before being discarded
Thanks for your honesty so sorry for the trouble you are having now better days are ahead 🥰💞💕💜
I’m so sorry to hear this all happened. We will still be here, no matter what you decide to do. We love you!
I just wanna know when you're going to start up Tati Beauty again and start creating more make up because it's still one of the best pallets I have. I know legal stuff and everything over the last few years is something to work through, and build back from, but I'm here whenever you start up again!
Have to say looks like our Texas is treating you well!! You look amazing !! I love your hair!! ❤️
Lots of prototypes never make it to market, I think it goes for cars, clothing, shoes, and etc. I applaud her for being a business owner who wasn't afraid to take a risk and then just run with it.
Is there any possibility for Tati beauty to come back in the future?
I wanted this
Tati you look stunning today 🤍
You are slightly off centered in the frame at least for the first 9 min. But your hair looks great!
I'm so sad that Tati didn't get to launch the final form of this palette.  I loved the concept behind Textured Neutrals vol. 1, but I didn't buy it because I knew it wasn't something I would use often since I'm not a neutral kind of gal.  Even in its not-quite-final form, the color story in this palette is so much more my speed, and I probably would have bought it in a heartbeat on launch day!  But, things happen and all of our lives have changed so much in the last two years.  We've all been knocked down and thrown all around by the pandemic, but I agree with Tati - it's not over!  I hope we can all get back up, and I can't wait to see what comes springing forth from Tati and her wonderfully creative mind!
I'm not understanding why you had to purchase your own palette which is being sold illegally? Don't you have one of your own? WHY don't you just start ANOTHER COSMETIC COMPANY? Do you still sell those vitamins?
I've got your initial Tati palette! Love it!
I thought TatiBeautu was closed????
Good that you have lawyers after them. It’s not fair for you.
The Volume 1 is still my go-to palette. & will always be. It’s perfect.
Glad your standing up for your creation. Your an amazing and beautiful person and you deserve the respect of catching whoever chose to steal your collection. Wishing you peace and happiness 💖
Open a new brand already!
Ty for sharing 💓
I hope you can make all your dreams come true, Tati 💗  I've been a fan for years and I've seen you evolve and find yourself over time. You are an inspiration to many, and you will keep doing great things. I'll be the first one in line whenever you launch a new palette 🥰❤❤❤
Not loving the editing here (quick zoom in and out)
Oh Lord.....🙄
Sorry this happened to you but you have our support!
I am so sorry people have done this. It has to be heartbreaking. I hope one day you are able to create makeup again.
So sad the brand ended. Wasn’t able to buy Vol. 1 like I had planned on. But glad to see her back making videos.
Can't wait for you to start a new company when or if  you're ready.  Your ideas are fantastic and it's obvious you've put so much thought and effort into your brand. Keep your head up! So much respect for you Tati.
😘
Does Tati takes delivery charges from winners of giveaways too.
I just want the Volume 1 😢
Too much talking 😒🙄 and the palette was meh! 😑
The palette is gorgeous, so sad your brand closed down. I hope your legal case is going well ❤
are you going to start another beauty brand?
You needed the 🦋's in your mind, your head ;  just to get through a tough time. Living da bad life in reality makes you're pretending living a good life in your mind.
I really wanted that cool tone neutrals pallette
I would have loved this!
You make watching beauty channels awesome again
Love you Tati please keep up the creativity that you have in you.   We are all your loyal fan base.  And we can wait for you to put something out.  But never lose that creative side.
My first thought was where can I buy it? Where people found it?🥲😅 I have high hopes one day you will make more make up & palettes 😭 I don’t want use my volume 1 because I don’t want to run out 🥹
Your Volume 1 Textured Neutrals palette is still one of my hands down FAVORITE palettes. The formula is unbeaten, the glitters are so stunning  I really hope you come out with another one someday 😊
when did she move to texas?!
Was it finished?
Tati lifestyle line *imagining the class*
You're palette was one I fell in love with. The glitter formula was sooo good and I'm so sad we wont get more. I hope one day you will revisit this.
This video just makes me sad the brand is over. I can’t imagine how Tati feels making this video
I love Tati beauty, I would love to have this pallete if it was launched
I feel like your powder sponge has kind of been stolen
Beautiful color story
I'm so sorry for what's been done to you and how people have treated you. You are such a strong person and I admire your resilience. I love you Tati!! I can't wait to see what you will come up with next!! Stay strong! 🤍🤍🤍
I want one of the blending sponges so bad
🥺🥺🥺🥺
I haven't been to this channel in a little bit... she isn't wearing a wedding band... I would be sad to know she got divorced... I bought her puffs/blendesr and I still use it today. They were so great.
I love my Tati palette ❤️ When you make another colour palette I’m buying that one too ❤️❤️
Welcome to Texas,  I am glad you are enjoying our state!
I find it heartbreaking hearing how passionate she was about Tati beauty 😔she deserves her beauty brand , making glitters at home for fun etc.Bless her x
Tati, I adore you so much! My first ever pricy palette(pricy for me)that I have ever bought was your Volume 1…I guess for me it was a big deal to  purchase so now I am so glad I bought it because it’s the best one. I would rave about it too everyone. When I wear it, I get so many compliments and I love it so much. Love you Tati.
We live and learn and hopefully grow !! You are amazing and will rise again 💕🥰
Omg Tati. I wish you launching a new palette or any product. You can’t imagine how much I trust you. Iam keeping vol1 coz its so precious for me Iam thinking to give it to my daughter in her wedding coz this palette out of the world♥️♥️♥️
I hope you make more makeup down the road. The Vol 1 palette is my ultimate favorite!
wowowow you’re gorg
If that is not the final/approved product, why did you make so many? 🤔
your hair looks incredible (: I want to learn how to style my hair better
I’m so sorry you’re having to deal with this!
How are you not allowed to mention anything if you are the creator of the palette?
I'm watching this and I keep thinking .. wow this woman is beautiful! I love you tati your just an amazing person inside and out. Super bummed we didn't get this amazing pallet.. I would have been all over it.
Your skin looks impeccable, would you mind sharing your base face?
Tati is on her reputation era now
~scandal~ is to Tati as oxygen is to humans
Wow that’s was a really pretty palette 🎨.
Now u know why she moved to Texas… taxes…. It’s hard to make it in California and the north west.. Texas is very company friendly where California has the employees back…
10 min of rambling 😒
Mad respect for Tati. Real 1s will be real. Tati, you've always felt like a best friend to us all XOXO
Thanks for your honesty. It’s all good. 😁
Any one know hair colour shade of Tati hair .Thanks
Know your strength is way more beautiful than any make up u put on! 💛
Oh maaan......thats a bummer. That pallet looked sooo good!  Im just glad i got my hands on  your first (and now we know, the only) pallet - aaand your beauty 'hearts' - i am btw over the moon happy with the quality of my pallet Tati <3 You did gooood!!  Cant wait what you'll bring to the table for us , and being so creative im sure it'll be amazing!!
I still have volume 1. I use it often.
I have your Volume one TATI beauty palette and I love it I wish I would’ve gotten two more for back up! I hope and pray that in the future you can we open TATI beauty and create beautiful wonderful products. Love your Positive attitude and outlook in life
That image was stunning.
WOAH
Best brand ever!
Your hair looks nice
This video made me go and sit with my copy of the textured neutrals palette and just touch and play with it. I'm so sad that your vision for this second palette couldn't come to life. I will treasure the textured neutrals always. I always get compliments when I wear it, and I only save it for special occasions. If I have something important to go to, I bring the Tati out! It never fails me. I so hope to experience your creations in the future Tati ❤️.
Love u don’t ever give up
Love u
I love u
Can't you continue with your make up line through HALO?
Stay strong 💪🏼 Tati, u got this girl 💜
I really hope u make another brand! Ur pallet is my number one pallets. The one I travel with every time I wear those glitter ✨ shades plp are always asking me what is it.
I wish I’d gotten the first pallet when I had the chance😕
Omg this is crazy that I just saw this video after I saw the palette online . Wow , I was wondering wth is this palette and boom I see your YouTube !! I love that you made sure people know what’s going on and to not support these people !
I wasn’t around this world when volume 1 came out but if I was I would have bought it. I’m so sad I can’t now because it’s gorgeous.   I’m so sorry people suck so much that this got stolen. I also am so sorry you had to shut down Tati Beauty and I hope one day you get to make your dream come true to make makeup again. ❤️
Bring Tati beauty back please I want this palette!!!
So sad of this happening! I hope they find them.
Still in love with the volume 1 palette
Ugh this looks like it was going to be amazing! I still love my volume 1 palette and I use it daily, it’s my favorite palette
I am so sad for you Tati. I keep Vol. 1 in my Bridal Kit and use it constantly myself. Your shadow formulas are truly beautiful.
I would totally be behind you starting a new makeup brand YOU are awesome and so amazing I would buy all of it I love you girl all the love and lightGod Bless— Reina Park💜💐💜
I would’ve loved this it’s so different from anything
Lets cut to what is real….this palette was stolen, please don’t buy it!!! So why does she spend 18 minutes telling us her “vision” and “butterflies” she is promoting this palette by her words. I have never heard of this palette but now know it’s out there to buy. Is this anyway to discourage people from buying the palette? No no no!!
👏🏻 Big 👏🏻 Girl 👏🏻 Lashes 🙌🏻 - here for this energy 😍
I also wish I could see some swatches just because
You are beautiful and radiant! Texas looks good on you! Tati, if you ever decide to do a makeup brand again, I'll be a loyal buyer. I still have my OG palette and use it anytime I have a formal event!
can u please pull a Kathleen and let Tati Beauty be ur KL Polish and come back hard w ur Lights Lacquer? pleaseeeeee 🙏🏼🥹
😭😭😭 I’m so sad. I would have loved this palette
I love it so much!
When she's ready she should just create a new beauty line and name it something different like Renew Beauty or Phoenix beauty since shes risen from the flames. either way I'd be nice to get to purchase. I never got my chance.
Prayers.  Don't let the devil shackle your dreams.
I managed to get hold of the Volume 1 I loved it, but for my coloring, its a bit warm, I was always hoping for a Volume 2 with taupes/mauves/mushroom/purple/champagne colors and I was hoping so much for the sequin texture to be switched out for a duo-chrome such as Clionadh shadows.
okay Mariah. Butterflies and fantasy? I hope you get to follow through on making these dreams come to fruition.
Tati can you please do a prom makeup tutorial or product recommendations for prom😭😭🫶🏻?
Hello beautiful Tati, Just cause someone stole one launch, pls don't let that stop u with continuously creating products for tati beauty! I know I definitely would love to see more from a cosmetic line that u have created, pls still do the cool tone neutrals I've been waiting since your first palette for u to do a cool tone version that's more up my ally, with white, Gray, black, Taupe, cool tone purples, and a periwinkle to dark teal blue shade rows!! Pls tati we still need your cosmetic brand in our lives and it would make for the most perfect cool tone volume 2, to go with your first texture neutrals vol1.  I'll definitely be one or the first ones to buy it, if u create it! Please don't let anyone take away the happiness you would feel while being creative. Have a wonderful rest of your week into/throughout your weekend!!! 💙XOXO💚
I wish I could get your volume 1 I’m so sad I can’t do it anymore.
I love your palette, is one of the best fórmulas ever, now i use it for special occasions cause it doesn't exist anymore :(
Pretty brave to make this video. Kudos for stepping up and continuing to move forward, Tati.  I’m a long-time fan and will continue to support you. xoxo
I have all the hope for the future that you’ll be putting out more makeup! I’ve loved everything you’ve put out. I’m so happy I sprung for the first palette and I cherish it! I love you and I can’t wait to see what you do!
I wish I could get another Tati volume 1 palette
Your first palette has and probably will always be my favorite. I get so many compliments when I’m wearing it and it makes me feel confident and beautiful! Can’t wait to see what you do in the future!
I’m so sorry this happened to you Tati! Thank you for sharing. The pallet is beautiful. :)
i am quite LITERALLY only 4 minutes in and the sheer amount of juiciness and hot tea-ization is just so goooooooood! all jokes aside, i'm so glad you're back Tati.  there was just a huge emptiness in the beauty space when you were away...there's no other like you.   xxx's x's a xillion
So sad! So glad to know for sure! I’m loving picturing you as a beauty scientist right now though lol side note I’d love a video on tinted moisturizers or spf with no scary stuff. Still so so so happy to see you’re making videos again!
aww :( by the caption i thought you are FINALLY launching a second palette :( well, still hopeful you will someday and i will be there supporting you 100% because i loved your first palette oh SO MUCH! xo
Wow I love the colours in this palette 💜wish Tati cosmetics didn’t fold!!!😢
I want that palette!!! Please come back with a brand no meter what it’s named!!!XOXOXO
Truly you are an incredible blessing to so many people.  Keep your head up and fight for your self and others to keep their dreams alive.  Thank you Tati!❤️
i really would like you to bring out more beauty products like eyeshadow palletes.
Tati please please move on and redo ! You deserve it ! You are trusted and we want product from you !!!!
Still love my Volume 1 and blendiful. I’ll use them until they fall apart. Build a new brand. You have the customer base still!!!
Still sad I never got my hands on the blendiful
Prototype the word is prototype love xx
Can you so a video about the pallete mom
Where can we get rings like that?
Get to the point…
2 years ago when I am still a high school student volume 1 is released and I dont have money to buy that and now that I am a makeup artist I really want to have even though its expensive for me because I am still a student now, I hope that tati beauty will be back😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 I have no where to buy it😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Would love to see a house tour 😍 but if you don’t like to share with everything what happened in your life I get hope you are doing amazing Tati love you 😍 😘
You are so gorgeous Tati. I wish to God you made a palette that “looked like you” 😂🥰. I would get that on “Auto-ship” Lol ❤️❤️ Anyway, congrats and as always GLAd To hAvE yOu BaCk🦋
I still regret not getting my hands on the pallet, I wanted it so bad, I still want it so bad but the time was not on my side. I had plans that I'd save enough and buy it someday but alas we are here..
Tati this is so sad but remember that they can take everything from you, but they can’t no take what is in your heart and mind. Keep going and creating !!
Damn i would have love to have that palette, but i know you will come up with something soon. I still have your volume 1 and it is my favorite
That hair 😍 tips?
Man volume1 was AMAZING! Pls bring it back Tati❤❤
This video breaks my heart! This palette is beautiful! I still use my Tati palette.
Whenever you can create a new Tati brand, I'll be here for it!  I love love love the Volume 1 palette!
I wish you could make Talc Free Pallet 💕
Still regret not having been able to get volume one before it was pulled off market  :( Not gonna happen this time! IM SECURING THE NEXT TATI PALLETTE!!!
I love my textured nuetrals vol 1 and I'm still mad I missed out on the blendiful please make more make up in the future!
Tati, you have been through enough. That is so clear. This leak exposure would be like rubbing salt in a wound at the loss of Tati Beauty. Perhaps drama channels recognized that and thought, leave Tati alone! So happy for you in this next chapter of your life 😘
I wish we would've gotten some notice before they shut down. I would've stocked up, or at the very least, not have let my daughter use it so much. 😭😭😭
Listening to Tati,  I can only imagine how heartbroken she must have been after so many dreams and plans she had for her makeup brand...
I have my first pallet and use it for all of my brides only bc I want to save it for as long as I can 🥹
This makes me so sad. She had so much to grief since 2020 and it just keeps coming... I love that she stays positive ans keeps smiling. I hope that one day she has the possibility to have a brand again and create beautiful and good quality makeup once again...
Your pallet is the only one I still use . It's my favorite by far. I hate how I can't buy another one
I hope some day you may be able to launch your own makeup again, love the videos glad you're enjoying Texas:)
How can I get tati beauty palettes in India???? Pleaseeeee I neeeeddddd themmmm
We all still love youu!
Ugh!!!!! Why would you talk so much about the drama instead of swatching what you had in the works. I was so looking forward to more products designed by you but the drama got in the way. This video was a tease and just more drama 😢😢😢
I have a feeling that she is going to move over to home, she’s in Texas! get ready for the new Magnolia but better by Tati 😂🤷🏾‍♀️
❤️ 💕 ❤️ ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️ you!! Too bad, our loss really! 😞
Not to mention anyone that even has it can be charged with possession of stolen property
Make the blendiful again, i neeed to try it😍
So no more tati beauty??? Bc I need a new palette...just the first one
You look great Tati!
I'm still kicking myself that I didn't buy your first palette. Money was tight and I was on a no makeup buy. And I took for granted thought it would always be there because you are a consummate creator. I still wish I had volume 1 but I know you're an artist and you will create more so I'm putting more Creations by you out into the universe.
I can only imagine how irate this made you. I'm sorry.
I'm sad I didn't get Volume 1. I hope you get a new makeup line in the future. ❤
One day… I have faith in you. 💗💗
Makeup looks stunning!
ugh, so unfair about the enchanted textures not launching. all those colors are AMAZING!!! please recommend the green glitters!!!
I wish I got the original palate when I had the chance 😭😭. Now the vultures are charging $350+ on Poshmark 💰😒
I’m so sorry someone has taken something you had worked o and wasn’t finished with & stole it to sale for their gain !! We love you Tati and know you’d never put a makeup product out there that wasn’t amazing!! Prayers & love sent your way
Tati!!!! First… you are beyond one of the most beautiful women inside and out. The only reason I ever started watching youtube is because you have always inspired me. Never doubt yourself. And never let people steal your sunshine. haters are going to hate but that is usually because they are either hurting or super insecure people deep down and usually the people that need love the most. not that you don’t know that.   i am a 36yo nurse… i love that your sister is a nurse because i feel like you can understand that life.   i know you aren’t asking for my opinion but i think tati beauty should be brought back again. i have been looking left and right for your volume 1 pallet, and have been so tempted to take my sister in laws.   keep doing what you are doing!!!! i send you all good vibes your way. thanks for always keeping it real!!!    xoxox
Looking forward for your next launch! I love my palette but I use it sparingly since I can’t go out and repurchase. Also, my blendiful is still in really good shape even after daily use.
Somebody approached me under a comment I made on your videos saying they were you and do I want to buy the palette.  Since it was under your video on this channel I assumed it was real.  Not I know it was not.  Sad sorry for you and everyone who wasted their time with people trying to sell a palette.
Really wish I would have got the first palette
11:25 to first see a photo of the palette.
I was so excited getting Vol.1 and I'm not lying, I was so disappointed to know I would never get another. I'm more upset knowing I can't get the second palette, especially now that I have seen the shades. My God that is beautiful
Stay strong tati.🥰🥰🥰 And can we pleasee get a review on this look.🥰❤🤩
PS - I use my Tati Volume 1 and Blendiful every day. I WISH that Tati Beauty was still in existence, I never want to use up my palette, I was so excited for more 😭
I’m still kinda confused on why Tati beauty was closed?.. I watched that video but I feel like you didn’t really make it clear. I have volume 1 and I loved it!
Okay, but the video/camera quality is SO GOOD! The background, the picture definition - Amazing! Tati you look incredible! 🦋❤️
So happy to have Tati back. She lost her sparkle for awhile but it’s back in full force! I can’t wait to see what she creates next! Would love to see a home decor line!😍🥰
I was never in the position to buy any of the products from tati beauty 😪 hopefully u can come out with something bigger and better when ur ready to
Thanks for taking the time to tell us what is going on ! It’s so sad that the industry has so many thieves. You look amazing and so glad you are focusing on your health and inner peace .
Thanks for sharing this with us!! I’m glad to see you opening up and letting in on the BTS stuff!!
Don't give up. Keep trying. We got you.
Please come out with more makeup I love your vision🥺
I want to say your hair is so beautiful here, and I love the full makeup. I know you are in a different place now since you moved from LA and then Seattle but we still watch to see your amazing makeup techniques and lovely styling soooo........Tati, why don't you do a regular series of special occasion make up. I'm talking about complete make up looks, all done up for a night out, lashes and all. You could do Summer weddings, Prom, a night out to a play or opera, a first date, anniversary dinner, engagement party, a cruise, dancing with friends. The beauty of it is, you don't have to go any where, just show us how you would do the look, from start to finish for the special occasion featured and give us all your tips and tricks as you go through the series. It would also be fun if you chose a color story for each occasion. Glitter and glitz it up or go sleek and classy. You have amazing talent and we will watch but I miss seeing you actually doing make up. Oh, since you're in Texas you could do it up big for a Texas night on the town, because I'm told everything is bigger in Texas. Hugs!
You look really healthy. Texas looks good on you!
How on earth did someone get a hold of your unlaunched product?
Your first palette is still my fave
Oh wow! I’m in Texas. 😄 As for the palette…it’s gorgeous! I would have bought it….but only if you had released it.
I am so glad I am still loving my first Tati Beauty 🎨 and was lucky to purchase an extra one when they launched that I have not yet had to use. I wear Tati’s glitter ✨ whenever I am celebrating anything. I am 43 yrs old and this mama loves herself some glitter ✨ I hope that eventually Tati gets to relaunch another Brand. The sky 🌌 is the limit.
Not loving the vibe in the video. Sending love and healing Tati 💕
My volume 1 is still my favorite pallette!
So she purchased her own palate on line???
Gutted this never happened. I love my volume 1 palette and would have loved this one too xxx
How very big of you to get up, brush yourself off and keep reaching for the stars Tati!!! God has a bigger & better plan for you.  You are and you will be just fine.  My tears came down watching your video only because I felt your pain as you spoke about what is going on.  I also felt your strength and your growth and you should be extremely proud of yourself.  Sad to say but people will always be people and money will always come before anything or anyone else and that’s just too bad for them because they will always be miserable.  All we can do is pray for them.  A lot harder said then done.
Please bring back Volume 1 :( I missed it by a month.
I wish Tati beauty would come back😭😭😭
LOLL the butterfly obsession phase <3 i miss it
I am so happy I have the original 1st palette....scared to use it since we can't get it anymore 😪 I really hope you will get back on track with Tati beauty in the future. Lots of hugs from Belgium 😘
You had me dreaming with you about this opportunity that was stolen. Watching you, I know that it would have been dreamy and stunning. Whatever your next endeavor, it will be from your heart and soul. I am already looking forward to it. I love the vlogs, too!
Tati, I commend you for continuing to be honest and brave through the hurdles with your brand. As a quality professional I understand the severity of this situation. There’s so much more occurring in the background when situations like this occur. Most people can’t even begin to imagine the magnitude or implications situations like these have. I’m sorry this happened to you. Stay strong!! I have no doubt you have a wonderful team supporting you through the process. 💜
So sad I didn’t get my hands on volume 1 before you closed. Totally my fault but it made me so sad.
❤️
Yo seria feliz de que Tati beauty regresara con el vol 1 (para poderla comprar) y también compraria está la volumen 2
Ok, but if it wasn't the final/approved product, why produce so many units?
The reason why people didn't tear you down is because you are definitely so well loved and respected. I do hope you come back with a new product. I personally purchased the palette & the blendiful & I dream about another product from you! ❤
So, when will you restart Tati Beauty? Kathleen Lights got some of her old polishes back on market, so anything is possible.
I feel like she's given up on her ideas and even maybe putting out makeup, I can just see her soul hurt and mine does too! I really hope that maybe one day she can continue on...
Different eyes?
I rarely use my volume 1 palette, because I'm about to hit pan on quite a few shades and I love it so much, but now I know I can't repurchase.  I'm sad..... Understatement.
I cant see the video
this is so sad I used your makeup for my wedding this past November and it turned out stunning my hair on the other hand was a hot mess lol so at least my makeup looked great even the photographer said my eye shadows was showing up beautifully on camera I really hope one day your start another cosmetic line *fingers crossed*
Ugh! Not gonna lie, this breaks my heart a little bit. I cherish my Vol 1 pallet because it literally is the best eyeshadow pallet I own. I would have bought that in a heartbeat.
I have the OG, but these would have been my favorite - cool tones for the grey-haired, blue-eyed 67-year-old  (almost 68 now!).  Sad, but we still have some time, God Bless!
I’m so sad I never got my hands on Tati pallets 🥲
I truly hope one day (if you wish) that you are able to create a new & even better makeup brand, where you can really take all those creative dreams you had and still have and make them a reality. If you ever were able to and decided to launch a new brand, we would all be so thrilled and supportive! Wishing you all the best ❤️
Can you imagine the poor cop that had this case thrown on his desk.  By the end of it I'm sure his or her blush application was flawless.
It sucks this happened and thank you for making a video about it.. because I did see it online and I almost bought it!
your hair is absolutely beautiful
Sometimes I wonder if she'll one day come back with a Tati beauty launch and surprise us🥺🥺🥺
I will not support thieves. I will not support thieves... (but when I saw the purples and greens, I almost DIED). I LOVE my textured Neutrals Vol 1 palette so much. I am always on the hunt for a palette that includes purples, greens, and greys. It doesn't exist!  I know Tati Beauty will be back someday, and I will support the brand again. xoxo
I'm a day late but TATI...girl, you are the best and never doubt yourself!
I have my vol 1 pallet and blendiful still, and am still using in my everyday rotation. Keep creating and thank you for still giving us awesome content to watch.
Never got the change to get a blendiful. I hope one day things can settle and if you want and are able to launch again. I love my volume 1. It’s my favorite palette of all time. I’ll be sad once I completely use it up 🥹. There’s not another one like it in my opinion
Sadly I never got to try the palette from Tati Beauty, but I have to say how much I love Halo Beauty. I’ve been taking the HSN consistently for over a year and recently my hairstylist said I have the healthiest hair she’s ever seen. I never get hangnails any more either and my nails are strong and never split or tear.
Wasting law enforcement resources for stolen makeup palettes.  Good lord.      That even happens to luxury brands and it’s also business you shut down.
I like how she’s so glam in her 40’s.  She’s glam without being over the top extra. I like that
that is gorgeous!!
Tati why don't you make a new brand you product wew by far the best ...
Your hair looks so stunning! Also I still have your volume one palette and I love it. The formula still is just so beautiful even years later
I’m just gutted this never happened for you. 😭
Can we never get this palette? It's soooo beautiful😍
pls bring textured neutrals v1 back
I wish I could have bought a blendiful before they shut down… :(
OKAY HAIR😍 i wish we could’ve got to see the full campaign, I love you sm
YOU LOOK GREAT :-)
I used volume 1 for my wedding day, you will forever be part of my special day Tati!
I would totally have bought that. The colors are beautiful and I love fairy tales. I still absolutely love my Tati Beauty palette. I still use it and I remember buying it the day it launched. Hopefully the future will bring new adventures and success for you!
Someday, maybe we’ll see a transformed version of your beauty line again ♥️
I will never forgive myself for accidentally breaking my Volume 1 palette... Your formula and colors was my favorite in my collection :')
Really love your new setup!
You did the right thing here. Nobody in their right mind would now purchase it because we stand with you and will not support theft!❤️
Tati delivers everything without promising anything! I'm sad people did this to the pallete, but I'll always be here for any future launches, love you Tati :)
Do you think that maybe you can make a couple videos regarding what you wish you knew before you started a business? Or maybe tips?
I am digging Tati 2.0! So HAPPY you are back.
<3
I own one eyeshadow palette and it is yours. I love it!
no swatches:(
Omg! Tati, your new filming setup is bomb, you've never looked clearer and sharper before!
Sorry for being so off subject of this video, but I have to know how you curl your hair like this! 😍
STILL LOVE THE BLENDIFUL - i'm always here for anything new
My volume 1 is near the end . I loved it so much and would do anything to replace the empty.
I wan't it!!!
I truly truly hope that someday it becomes possible for you to start another beauty brand, it so clear that it's a passion and it's loss has been surely felt. It's been bittersweet to watch this evolution of your life, because you're authentic and have such a sparkle in spite of all that's happened. I look forward to the day your joy is once more unburdened.
Bless you Tati. You took the high road
You should start a new brand!
Sometime in the future I think it would be so amazing if you did a series about being a business owner and helping educate people about the behind the scenes and what that really means
was this product approved?
It all sounds to me like God maybe took all of this away from you because it was a source of something bad amd would have escalated into something worse. Especially when you mention the butterfly "spell", maybe there is some spiritual reason behind all of it.
She shows the palette at 14:04 for those wanting to skip. I wish this palette was released.
Literally so sad I wish this could’ve come to fruition and I know something better will come out of this series of events!
Man I love this video. I loved your first pallet one of my most used ever but we want more from you!!!
The most beautiful woman ever.
You are respected & loved. Please continue to embrace the support around you because no one can squelch your creative gift because God granted it to you. Sadly in life we never really know what we are spared from when our life takes a detour that is out of our control & not a reflection of our vision. I’m so happy that you continue to help us all with our make up application & obsession. Lol. I think we can all understand how this would trigger someone. Your feelings are valid and I’m glad that you have this platform to express them. Have a beautiful day! ❤️❤️❤️
Praying that the prosecutors will get you the justice you deserve ❤️
I would had bought this
I would have loved a cool tone version of the Textured Neutrals!
Thank you Tati for your honesty…listening to your video was like being with a good friend coming back from h…. and telling me it's ok, you have it in you to get up and pass this bad moment…needed that today…love you ⭐️💖
We don’t care what you film to put out - we like YOU.  So sorry this all happened to you
Is this the palette you wore on your first video after you came back? I've been thinking all this time what was on your eyes since it was so pretty!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am looking for full coverage foundation for dry skin what is the best high end brand and cheaper brand?
This was so bittersweet. Me and my daughter, who is 14 now, love Tati’s first pallette and we’re excited for second one. 🥰
I Have That 🎨 Palette! It is Excellent!! The colors are FAB! I bought mine from an online shop! And there's Nothing wrong with the palette! I LUV IT!! 💖
The Purples…. Dang.
I absolutely love my volume 1 palette from you and i get so many compliments and it’s been my go to palette and I really hope you come back with beauty products in the future because the formula and colors are absolutely stunning 🥰
Your first pallet i use almost everyday. Sucks that happened. I hope to see a new one soon!! You have the best formula I've ever used.
Love you Tati!! Can’t wait to see what you create next! ♥️♥️♥️
Big girl lashes! Hahaha
I still have the volume part 1 (: one of my favorite palettes <3 i still use it to this day!
i would have loved this one tbh
If this palette was never approved or intended for sale, why were so many manufactured?
Girl, if you don’t get back up on that makeup creating horse……… you HAVE to TATI!!!! I looooove my first palette!! You were built to create make up !!!! 💜💜💜💜
It may be time to have a Taylor Swift moment, Tati. Someone stole the music she wrote and guess what… she re-recorded FIVE albums and released them making her the rightful owner (there’s some weird legal nuances, but she owns it all again). Don’t let someone steal your idea, your dream and your work! I hope you’ll be inspired to get back in the lab in your beautiful new Texas abode and recreate this gorgeous palette so that we can all buy it! Love you, Tati. This chapter will be your best yet! 🚀❤️🙌🏼
Tati! I'm in Dallas! This is the first I'm hearing about you moving here! Congrats, it's beautiful, save your praise until you get done with summer though. 😂
Tati you are going places! You’re going to soar! And I’m here for it 🤍
I really hope that you launch a new palette one day. I’m treasuring the palette that I do have. Textured neutrals
bro tati u look so good omg ily
I love that you shared some of the behind the scenes with us and talked about some of the visions you had for this palette and other products & collections. The idea of your palettes being able to be stacked like books with the cool bookend feature is just the coolest idea! For all us readers out here that love makeup, that just speaks to us. It would be really cool if maybe the odd time you could do a video that talked about some ideas of what you would make if you were creating makeup right now, what a palette or collection would look like or what products you would want to create in this moment (seeing as it changes so much with time), with some mock-up computer (or just hand drawn) visuals of what a palette or collection would look like. I think people really love hearing about this creative side of you, and everyone longs to hear of the ideas you had in the past while at Tati Beauty, but also the new ideas you have now in this new chapter.
When you kept saying butterfly butterfly butterfly,  it reminding me of the scene in Secret Life of Pets 😊 my kids say it all the time. Wow what a beautiful pallette. I would have bought that for sure 💜💙
:(
I keep my original tati beauty palette separate from my other make up so no one accidentally messes with it.  knowing i cant replace it hurts man
I know you said you weren’t bringing Tati Beauty back but I would LOVE to see it come back! I never got the chance to buy your first palette and I’m so upset I didn’t.
I held off on that volume one until it was too late. I was able to pick up one on a third party market - I got so excited when I initially saw the thumbnail, I thought there was a surprise launch! I'm sorry people are stealing from you. You deserve better. Continue living your best - it looks darn good on you!
I know you’ve said Tati Beauty won’t be back, but I still hold hope that it will be. To this day your shadows are some of the best I’ve ever used!! Hope you’re doing good Tati
I literally know nothing about the behind the scenes of the makeup industry. But why were so many pallets made for a product that wasn’t even approved yet?
Oh my freaking god! I am so so terribly sorry that happened to you!! Your product!! That is a nightmare, ugh so terrible! Much love to you tati!! Love love your content and you! You are so bubbly, and lovely 🫶🏽💗🥺 thank you for sharing the palette with us! It is gorgeous 👏🏾💕
I still have my Tati palette she did a good job
I’m so stupid because I didn’t purchase the eyeshadow pallet and now I can’t purchase it anymore so sad 😭 I wish I can try it I hope one day you can make something new and I promise I will run and purchase it
Omg Tati I'm so sorry you're still dealing with all of this drama 🥺 it makes me so sad for you. But please know that you have a lot of subscribers who love and support you!!! This pallete looks like it would have been BEAUTIFUL!! 😍❤️ And all the ideas you had for future collections sound beautiful as well. I hope this all blows over soon and you find the peace you deserve. This year is all about new beginnings and I believe that everyone including you will at some point experience it. I love you and wish you the best!! I'm glad you're loving Texas still, I love it here and I know you will too ❤️
Was waiting for this
I wish you would bring Tati beauty back. 😔I’m so happy I bought your volume 1 palette, your vision with makeup is like no one else. ❤️
Don't give up! Make-up, Make-up!!!! Do not let this drama king and queens steal your joy again. Keep your head up and dive into your new life!
That sucks to  make your own eyeshadow and then have to go with what the lab makes or has to offer i so wish this would've come out and I still hold out hope to see a Tati beauty again someday
I use my Blendiful everyday! I’m obsessed!
What did she do to her face ?
My grandpa worked at a music company as a janitor and was told to destroy a few guitars. He saved some and gave them to some family members, but his one stipulation was that they couldn’t sell it in his lifetime, they’d have to give it back to him if they wanted to get rid of it. I feel like that private use is the one excuse I see to that aspect of business theft haha But makeup is different because that can actually hurt you by being unsafe chemicals or treatment & whatnot.
Just drop the damn palette already!!! Loved it omgggg
Tati, Texas looks GREAT on you! You are glowing 😍
I purchased your palette and beauty blender one day before you announced the closure and I’m so glad!! I love the palette and use the face sponge often (this morning) lol
Please don’t let this stop you Tati Please for your fans come back one day make more pallets we love your shadows and would love to see what else she would come up with
11:59 - is where Tati shows the actual never intended to go to market and please do not purchase because it has not been approved by her or under her TATI Beauty brand that is no longer - palette.
Wish you could at least sell the patent for the Tati Beaty Blendiful. I have seen so many rip offs on wish and more, but I wish I could buy something similar to the oryginal.
As a long time supporter I remember when you were creating the palette you were so excited and had this glow about you when you talked about it and honestly I miss that and I hope you can do it again soon! The world is ready for your creative light to shine! ❤️🙏😇
The textured neutrals palette is one of two eyeshadow palettes I own & I wish cherish it forever 💛
Tati beauty 😂
I had no idea this was going on. I'm so sorry Tati. That is truly upsetting that this has happened! Thank you for letting us all know what is going on. I understood what you were trying to say also.
What I don’t understand is if this wasn’t a finished product, why are there enough pallets to sold on the black market?
I hope one day you can finish what you started. I really loved everything you created ❤️
I absolutely love the first pallet. I slowed down on using it. I don't want it to run out so I only wear it on special occasions. I was worried I wouldn't be able to get another one! I really am holding out that after everything is settled with halo that we will get tati beauty! 🙏🍀🤞
Launch your makeup under halo beauty 😈
Tati none of this is a surprise to God. He has you in His right hand. You will be anchored in this storm.   Stay focused on our beautiful Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
Please make makeup!! It was so good and the best glitter ever!!  I want!!! But I don’t want to support someone who took this with out your approval.
Neat! Thanks for sharing this and some of the projects you had planned. 🤍
Tati you will continue to do great things
The shadows were made into actual palettes and you took professional photos so I feel like this palette very much was the final approved product but it didn’t get the best feedback so that’s why she kept pushing that it’s not approved 😅
If I see it then I won’t buy it now. I would have had you not have come out and said all of this so thank you. Its like downloading music illegally, no its not cool. Only makeup can be dangerous because someone could have added nasty stuff to it.
I love hearing about your dreams for the brand even though I know it’s so disappointing to not be able to continue 😔 I hope you are able to do color cosmetics again ❤️
So I don’t understand it you don’t want Ppl to buy the palette why are you promoting that palette ? Something is not quite right in this not promo promo video
I’ve kept mine pristine my volume 1! It’s a keepsake
So wish you could go ahead and have more beauty products come our.
The semi video about the thumbnail begins at 8:00 you’re welcome.
I still have and use my Textures Neutrals Volume One, but I wish I’d bought the Blendiful. Darn iPad keeps flipping my letters. I still would love one. I really feel it will help with my skin texture problems. One day, even if I have to buy a used one somebody no longer wants. They wash, so I’d be very happy.
Hey Tati ! Can you try Bobbi Brown (the actual person)’s makeup line  Jones Road?
But how have there been so many palettes produced if it wasn't approved yet?
I’m so happy you like Texas! It really is the best state! Visit us 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 deep in the heart of Texas 🎶 (San Antonio) soon!!!
Too bad it never launched, these colors are beautiful!!
I still love the original palette!! It’s a staple for me. I’m sad we didn’t get to see what else you would have come up with.
You're just flat out amazing!  🥰😘
You are so incredibly strong!!
Trying to make that money back
Bring back the 1st volume
I didn’t think a business would produce a run until it was approved… why produce so many when it wasn’t finished…. Hmmm.
I am so sad about this
The Enchanted Textures looked like a good palette. I would have however liked a true taupe color in there. Then it would be perfect. Perhaps there is a true taupe in there but I just cant tell
Tati, I think the term you might have been looking for was maybe "prototype?"
Hello Tati, I'm so sorry dang.. I still have Tati 1 and many other brands but never fails I always go to your pallet. I hate to hear all this I know I will be 1st I. line w/ any Tati products I also have Tati beauty blenders love them too 💜💜💜
Yessss come back ASAP
Tati don’t give up for one disappointment, God gave you a gift don’t let it and thank you for sharing this with us 🥰
but the company was closing?
God has a bigger plan for you Tati ❤x
I use my volume 1 every day!!!!! I’m so excited
Tati, you recognized my work when Vol 1 was released and it meant the world to me. I’m so sorry you had to shut your brand down but I hope one day you get to live your dream again. 💛 You have my support, girl!
I am so honored I have the first Tati palette! I almost cancelled the order too.. so glad I didn't. 🙌🏻 But I'm SO sad about this palette that was stolen.... awful.
Tati! When are you gonna give us a house tour?
I was looking for volume 1. Came across an offer up post and asked what the inside looked like. They sent me this pallet. I was confused. This all makes sense now. I just messaged to see if he still had some and yup. 🤦‍♀️ $60  This was in January   Update: He raised his prices to $80 ea
Can you please check out and review Lime Crime cosmetics? It looks interesting!
That palette truly was stunning. I am so glad you told us about this, how disgraceful. I hope they are prosecuting soon. We need to get the word out that this is stolen merchandise and stop people from buying. I hope you will feel your dream and put on another line someday. I have similar hair, I'd love to see a video tutorial on how you styled it, looks amazing!
I wish I could get another volume 1… mine is loved, but there are certain rows I wish I could have
I would have bought this. I was so sad when my autistic kiddo destroyed my first palette from you. I cried. 😭
I would have LOVED that palette ;-;
Tati, I see the Light within you! God bless.
Omg! The colors are amazing! Hope u can come out with something similar in your name. It's a shame it was stolen from you. Your first palette was amazing,  and expect that anything u put out will be as well. ❤
Are you salo more of the one eyeshadow palette
Omg I would buy that pallette in a heartbeat if it was real and launched by Tati!!!
I wish I could have seen what you would have done with purples because they’re your favourite. BUT. Life does what it does. I’m glad you’re feeling happy in Texas ❤️
Please create and launch again! Still hoping for more eyeshadow to come. ‘Step out the shadows’ by Tati 😉
Jeezus - talk about the knife that just keeps twisting - I’m so sorry Tati! Thank you for sharing this. I also had a fairly public business”fail” that wasn’t really my fault (just locally - not on the internet) but it’s been very hard to know what direction to go next- so just thank you for sharing this so openly - plz know your story goes way beyond & is so much bigger than makeup 💕
How is a product not approved but you did a photoshoot and also a lot of palettes? If you have a Prototype, it is a single one, you don’t make a couple of thousands and then destroy them and say it was not approved, something doesn’t sit right with me 😅
I love my Vol 1 palette. It’s one that I use for special occasions. This palette looks beautiful!!! I really wish it would have launched!
I’m always so sad I never got the volume 1 😭
Tati says she wants to find her peace and you can tell she finally has. 🤗
THAT BACKGROUNG IS GORGEOUSSSSS
Please bring back your makeup line :(((
I still love my palette of yours! I still use every opportunity
Tati looks way better (happier, more vibrant) than she has in MONTHS! Happy for you, Tati!
Please pleeeaseeee create more make up, please. We’re begging you.
😥😥😥
Don’t bother watching ; it’s way too long about nothing 😂😂
I’d love a blendiful dupe 😭
It’s still so sad about Tati beauty. Never got the chance to buy vol.1 wish I could have my credit card approved so I could have. But it’s nice having you back
How terrible for someone to profit from your hard work and heartache!?!? The audacity of some creatures to do such horrid things is beyond me! I would have totally bought it had it been released (and was *dying* for a cool neutral palette) but will NEVER purchase from thieves who probably have it stored underground in a rat infested sewer where they themselves dwell....couldn't fathom how anyone could actually put it on their eyes after thinking of that, ugh! Anyhow, I'll always love and support you!
I still use my original textured neutrals palette!
I literally almost bought one of these pallets. But it seemed sus.. so, I didn’t buy.
Girl, you do have your big girl makeup on for this one! Would love to see an old school Tati tutorial on this look please!
Oh Tati I really hope one day you can create a new beauty brand because I still have and use your original palette and blendifuls. You get us 💙
🙋‍♀️ question, why would it be in a pallet if it’s not a final product?
Well done Tati on making this video. I know it wasn’t easy for you❤️. Your loyal subscribers will always support you, you are worth it. Shame on those who are selling the palette. You take care of yourself and stay well💕
💄❤Hi Tati….you are such a creative Aquarius woman, just like me. I’m still using and loving my Tati Beauty Volume 1  and the 3 Blendifuls’ I ordered and so is my Sister. I’m sorry to hear you’re even having to deal with this sort of “thing”….but thru it all, you have proven that time and time again,  we are all stronger than we think, that thru Grace & God, we can do anything❤️💄
I will always wish I bought 2 of your original pallet. It was gorgeous and the glitters were everything I could have asked for. I miss it!
Awww I was WAITING for the colour palette 😭😭😭😭 this is so sad. I was so excited for this brand. Sending love :(
Day 73 of thanking Tati for the video 💙🌟
i always hold off on buying anything but there’s something about you that makes me trust the quality you always give and it GIVES can’t wait for the next product ❤️
Love you Tati 💕💕💕
Tati it truly looked-good so sorry it didn’t work  out , but never mind there is always another !   my love liz xxx
I’m so sad! That would have been so beautiful and would have been something I would have gotten. I really wanted the first one but I didn’t have a job at the time and when I finally got a job, got my life back, I went to get it and found out you had to close Tati Beauty. I understand.. it’s okay and I am excited to see what the future holds. Hopefully justice will be served! I am excited to see what the future holds 🥰♥️
Im sorry you went through that but just keep in mind if you ever decide to create more product that your supporters would be more than happy to purchase again. Your first palette was beautifully done. I really hope you do get to a place to create again because my Volume 1 palette is my top FAVORITE palette I own (I own over 20), but nothing comes close to the quality of yours I feel like. Either way I'm just so glad you are posting again and I get my Tati Time. I missed you more than you know on your hiatus, you have helped me escape some hard times. We love you Tati!!
I was so upset I didn't have the funds to buy your first palette.  I was waiting for someone to buy it for me as a gift lol. Whenever you launch your next beauty adventure, I'll be there! ❤️❤️ that's terrible that people steal these and sell them.  I can't imagine the feeling.  Sending you xo
I just got the best laugh over big girl lashes 🤣 I really needed that today!❤️
Dying!!! We want this!
I don't even use make up, but Tati is my fave Beauty guru. 💅
I use my Tati palette and Blendiful EVERY TIME I do my makeup - it's not daily but enough I truly love this palette and it's such a big part of my make up days.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I need some volume 2 lookalikes
Sending you so much love.   Unrelated. I'm 39, how can I get my dull brown hair to look even slightly as healthy and beautiful as yours? Seriously. Your hair is perfection!
So upset we never got the cool toned neutrals 😭
Crying that the cooler tones never made it… the volume 1 is to warm for me but I love it!
#tatibeauty
We love you so much Tati! You are seriously the best ever! Your makeup products and halo beauty supplements are my absolute fave! Love you Tati! So grateful for you and your videos! 🥰❤️☺️🦋💕
#perfectTati
I get moments every so often where I stop and think how grateful we are for Textured Neutrals Vol. 1 and how I wish the brand could have kept going to see all of your dreams come to light.
Lööve
U r the Best💕
Love you
I’m so excited to hear that you aren’t done creating. THAT is the best thing I’ve heard all month. ❤️❤️
Perfekt
Skip first 13 minutes. She just talked about new life chapter. 😂
Things will work out in God’s timing! Have faith! 🙏
Thank you for letting us know about this because I had no idea. I hope and pray that the people behind this theft are caught and brought to justice.  You have had enough crap in your life and you don't need this. Just know that your YouTube family is behind you 100%.
I’m so sorry Tati, you will get through this and you will be a super success with your next project!!!
It's amazing that you moved to Texas from Seattle... as many of us are doing including myself! We are going outside the Ft Worth area! I can't wait!!!
It kills me that I can’t buy this! 😭😭
Starved for more Tati makeup, especially the glitters & shimmers
Tati!! Please tell me what products you are using on your hair!
TATI! Girl I'm so glad your back. My mom who died a couple yrs  ago absolutely loved you. I found comfort in you videos when she left... then you left. I was completely heartbroken for you and even myself... I wanted that palette of yours soooo bad. And here you are again with more drama! Sorry someone stole and sold your.. "ideas" as that's not your final product. It looks beautiful. Would have loved that too. Beautiful and creative. I hope you bring your company back soon. I'm praying for a chance at that first palette lol. I will even buy it used at this point!! Stay strong chica!
Hey Tati the reason why drama channels didn't cover it is because the iconic queen of drama passed away! Here for the Tea passed away suddenly in November! I love this concept I would've bought it in a heartbeat! <3
I think your concept is so beautiful, I've been wanting to get my hands on your first pallet one day, are you still selling that pallet?? Or woupd you know where I can find one? But I do believe that you are far from being done with your brand forever love !!
Hello VIDEO QUALITY!!!! I feel I could pick you up out of my screen it's insane!!!
I hate that this happened! People can be so heartless. Such a kick in the gut.. hang in there, Tati!
The undercover world of espionage in the makeup community. Why? Because it is a huge business and makes a lot of money and evidently, your creations were worthy of theft and selling.
Here hoping you can re-start your cosmetics brand like Kathleen Lights was able to bring us her polish line again. 💕💕💕 still use my blendiful today!
My texture neutrals is still one of my favorite palettes. I always travel with it, it travels beautifully, even wearing it today.
Finally someone without a color on their nails, looks very refreshing and soooo much better!
Is she still married???
Need a hair tutorial
Just OPEN the fking palette!!
I use my textured neutrals only for special occasions since it was made known that there would be no more. I will be so sad when I hit pan on any of the shades because it is my favorite pallet! This pallet is GORGEOUS but I will not purchase from thieves.
I'm so sad. That palette would have been perfect for me. It is gorgeous! I would have bought 6 so I had back ups. 😉 Love you, Tati! Keep smiling! 😘💚
Why were there so many palettes made already if you weren't going to sell those? Honestly weird story.
Thank you for sharing this with us, Tati.
I love that you shared this! Stay positive girl!!!
I still use my Tati palette! I love it so much and it still performs as good as day one!
Love to you always.
I have my v1, I hope you get to make v2 in the future! I’d love cool neutrals for my paleeeee skin from you!
my textured neutrals palette is my all time favorite palette ever. it’s so stunning and every little detail is perfect. no matter what, at least you can take pride in the fact that you are a person who makes beautiful things. 🤍
Looking forward to any future official releases!!
I did see this palette on line, however I assumed it was a fake. It was on a dodgy website and I just knew it wasn’t a real Tati product because have been a loyal fan and customer for many many years and Tati never introduced us to this new palette.  My blendiful finally quit on me a couple of months ago,I have washed it hundreds of times, it was attacked by my cat and that was the end of it. Please please please bring back this product. I loved every single thing about it, the texture, the shape, the cushiness  I’m so sad i didn’t buy more when I had the chance…
Neve got a Chance To buy the first one because I’m more of a nEutrals matte only Girl,  but now I wish I had bought it :(
We need another make up company from You Tati
Oh man! That would have been my perfect palette! My colors. Sigh.
I wanted the first pallet so bad but couldn't afford it at the time! When I saw your title today I didn't even care what it looked liked I wanted to buy it because the last one I missed out and it was absolutely stunning..as is this one!
Hiya Tati thank you so much for sharing this with us!! I have your first pallet! Much love ❤️
Stunning palette! That green row 😍😍😍😍
I would still buy this palette now ): I hope you launch a similar palette when your rebuild <3
I have the first volume, if you ever have the chance to do this palette fully, PLEASE do these colors 😍 I would’ve been on this so fast. I adore color shadows, I would love to have your take on these purples, greens, and blues 😭
😩😩😩I’m so sad all around!!! I so wanted this your pallet still was the best  palletI’ve ever used
Need to bring back Volume 1. Mine is expired now and I loved it
This is horrible.  I am so sad this happened to you! I hope they catch everyone involved!  Hugs!!!❤️
I stopped using my volume one palette 😪 because I don't want to run out of it. There will never be a chance to buy it again 😭
The fact that I never got to buy Tati beauty is tragic but hopefully I’ll get another chance to buy makeup from Tati because she is seriously a creative genius ❤️
Omg can there please be a kickstarter for this to become available to us!? I know so many of us would back this because we need this in our lives 😭💜💚
That's a gorgeous palette! Would definitely have bought it :(
I love Tati but she goes off on tangents lol. It takes so long for her to get to the main point! Lol. Don’t come for me. I love her. She’s great!
Bootlegging is theft. I've always hated when I see people bragging that they got a knock-off of anything. Thanks for the clarification.
Every time Tati brings up Tati Beauty, I’m not gonna lie it makes me teary eyed.  😭 I LOVE vol. 1 and I am soooo sad that Tati Beauty closed down. But I am so glad to hear Tati is not giving up and even though the next creation may not be a makeup brand, I’m just happy that she is not giving up and the darkness didn’t win. So proud of you Tati and wishing you all the best!
That makes my heart drop... You deserve your brand, your success EVERYTHING more than anyone ALIVE in Beauty industry
As much as I would have LOVED to see this launch, I’m hopeful for everything you will create in the future. ❤️ I know with your tenacity we’ll see another eventual launch someday.
I am having serious FOMO since your video launched that Tati Beauty website was shut down and no more palettes were being sold.
I sooo hope you start creating products again one day. I really value your vision. I still love my vol 1 palette. AND I will continue to use the 🦋. I love it. It reprecense the journey for me. You are an incredible woman Tati. XOXO from Austria 🇦🇹
We love you Tati ❤️
That pallete is gorgeous though. I'm so sad it never happened. I was not able to get the original and really hope you can begin again with your beauty brand.
We love you Tati!
I am enticed to buy it but I will not out of respect for you! I’m enticed because your palette has been the only one I’ve consistently used since I bought it and it’s so versatile. I wish you had more because my whole shadow collection would become your shadows. I hope you can create again in future because you have so many supporters that love you and your makeup. ❤️❤️
oh, it's so pretty! I still have the original and I love it
I loterally treasure my Volume 1 palette, I was lucky enough to get it right before you closed shop and I use it a lot 😍 Man, I think you did the right thing addressing this if it leaked...let the people know where you stand. I always appreciate your transparency so much  thank you 💕
Omg I would die for a cool toned textured neutrals volume 2
Hello Taati. 🤝
Love to see video with similar Tati  consistency and pigmentation alternatives is the shops
Tati, your palette is the best of the best! The formula is everything and it’s so easy to package and travel with. I get compliments all the time when I wear it. The glitter is amazing!!
I was pumped for TNV2 because I'm a cool tone gal and was looking forward to the palette that was for me. It's cool to at least see the color story of another launch because a lot of people are curious about your vision. I hope everything continues to bring you happiness and better days. 🖤🦇🖤
All I know is I'm not waiting around the next time you create something! I could kick myself for not grabbing your pallette when it came out!   So enjoy following your journey, you're amazing!!!
she sounds like a robot and now shes talking like shes walking on egg shells
Peace looks amazing on you. I hope you continue you path with a cosmetic line. The passion you have for makeup pours out your soul. It’s a fresh start to a new beginning. You got this❤️
This girl is full of problems
Oh my goodness! I’m so sorry!! How in the freaking world did these get out to be SOLD??? I hope this gets solved
12:12 It was a beautiful dream and vision of yours. I still feel so so sorry that it didn't work out. All of your planned palettes would definitely be a great addition to this beauty world. Your formula was fantastic!! I wish somehow you will have other chances to turn some of your desires into reality in the future <3
Lol. Who else during her closing theme was waiting for the “gold halo bottle cap” and butterfly 🦋 to pop up? ☺️ Luv you, Tati. 💙🥰
So wish I could’ve gotten the volume 1 palette
I never got one
I wish I was able to get my hands on your Tati products before it shutdown. Praying someday you can relaunch your brand and grace us all with the greatest makeup palettes ever - you seriously have such talent and passion in beauty. Sending so much love!
SO glad you got away from the snakes in LA/Hollywood. You are glowing.
I truly hope one day she will go back to creating a new brand with palettes. The first palette was amazing and I would’ve loved to see more from  her and her brand. I still have mine and I am so glad I was able to get my hands on it. Heart breaking the brand is no longer but also glad she is on to better things.
Ooh those blues and violets.  Swoon.
That's wild! The world is so corrupt. I'm sorry that you're going through this. God works in His own ways and I'm sure He doesn't see this as a huge loss, especially in comparison to the gift that He has given you. Sounds like you have a lot more talents to share. 🎼🎹❤️🤗love your fresh hair color.
I’m so sad that you had to close 😭😭
I'm sad we all missed out on your makeup vision. Everything looks so beautiful. I still haven't gotten the first palette and I'm kicking myself for not grabbing it. Love you Tati and I'm hoping that one day you will have a new makeup line.
This is sad. And disappointed. I feel bad for miss Tati for what could have been. But I have to remind myself that it’s the past and this season will be fabulous for you.
Can we have a Tati beauty rebirth ??? 😭😭😭😭 you have the most creative beautiful ideas
Tati just say prototype.
Unrelated, but the lighting and quality of this video is gorgeous!
I still wish I could have gotten Vol 1… I’m so sad I missed out but I can’t spend $200 on it from a re-seller :(
Promo pictures look awesome, so sorry this palette never made it...I really hope you can implement it in the future!
One of my life's biggest regrets is that I didn't buy a dozen of Volume 1. I still use it consistently.
That is serious violation. I can’t imagine how that feels to have your creations stolen like that. ☹️
Big girl lashes sounds like a cool business slogan 🤔 future release from Queen Tati? Sign me up 🙋‍♀️💖😍
Cannot wait for the day you decide to create more! I barely use textured neutrals because I don't want to go through the whole thing...
So sad I missed out on the first palettw
I really would have loved this palette. Still love vol1 and will forever keep it in my collection. I am feeling anxious about the glitters as one day in the future they will go bad and be gone forever! P.s. Hi Saltzy!!!!! Miss your sassy footnotes. ❤
I cannot... Tati telling all the plans and I still want it all...I want that "book"
I hope you’re able to create a new makeup brand someday!
You can see it in her face how much love he has for her line & makeup Tati is such a beautiful soul ily😭🤍🤍
Thanks for clarifying about that palette, I didn’t know that’s what happened.  Please consider a tutorial for this hairstyle, it’s so polished and so many people would love to see it!❣️❣️
Honestly I'd be very angry if something had my name on it and I didn't make it
I love you tati ❤ that was an amazing palette idea, I'd have bought it immediately! I look forward to you putting out new make up one day. I wish you the best ❤
Tati, i'm so sorry for you, your creativity and your company. I can't even imagine how it's difficoult to see one own creation stolen and sold on line... I only hope that, one day, you will decide to start your make up company again, because your so special and deserve q lot of success😍
Tati I feel like you and Marlene Stelle from makeup geek have felt the effects of Covid in the beauty Industry. She just recently announced that she had to close make up geek. I am so sorry that you had to close, but I wonder if the two of you could chat and support one another. Women helping women❤️
We love and Support you Tati! you HAVE been through so much online and i am wishing you and your family nothing but health and wealth! <3
Xoxoxo
I seriously hope you make more makeup in the future 😩 I loveeeee the first pallete but I’m baby broke it.
I hope you can produce makeup again in the near future! I was so excited for other launches like lipstick or blushes etc. & I loooooooooove the color story for the non released palate!!!
This makes me a little sad that someone would sell your potential palette, but also that we didn't get to enjoy this.  I was SO into your book idea for the entire collections, and I still have your first volume.  I wanted this to work for you so badly. <3 I hope to see more from you in the future!
This makeup look is 🔥 please do a video!
I have Vol 1 & use it sparingly for special occasions only because I can’t get another.  It is just so good!  I also have a Blendiful & use it every day—I just love it!  Can’t wait to see your creativity & anxiously await being able to purchase it.  I know whatever it is, it will be fabulous!   💙💚❤️💜
That palette is gorgeous it a shame it never came out
I’m so sorry you’re having to deal with this, Tati! It is a beautiful creation, though, even if it wasn’t totally complete. Sending you prayers for peace.
I wish you could relaunch the OG and this new one someday. You'd have my money for sure!
what is this hair color woman!!!!!???? it's GORG!!!!!!
oh my goodness !!! i love how tati is just amazing and how she unfolded!!!  hiiiii to anyone seeing my comment !! how amazing would it be if tati sees this but if anyone sees this, i love makeup and i love sharing all things makeup on my channel :D
I appreciate you sharing your creative vision for Tati Beauty. I'm sorry you weren't able to see the creation of this palette all the way through. You're coming out the other side of some serious heartbreak, stronger than before.
I hope you start making makeup again the neutrals 1 palette is so good
I bought 2 of vol 1. And I gave one to my sister that was just starting out in makeup. I regret that decision because Tati beauty isn’t a thing anymore. So I only use that pallet for special occasions. I do have to say it’s barely been used the only one that looks like I dip into is the tan color. I will keep that pallet forever even when it’s empty.
This is so sad. My Textured Neutrals Palette is the BEST palette I have ever used or own. It’s one of my prized possessions. I really hope one day we get Tati Beauty back.
It was so stunning Tati😭 I’m currently in my random butterfly/ fairytale/ whimsy obsession phase… maybe someday you can do a similar vibe with different colors, like blush pink and champagne 🥂 I hope someday Tati Beauty is back🥺💖
Tati, you look glowing in this video!! I’m so happy you’re back, happy and healthy ❤️❤️❤️✨✨✨
I really hope someday you can come out with it. I have never found a better formula than yours, Vol1 still my favorite pallet ever😭
Ohh, this is killing meeeee! It is so so gorgeous! I am so gutted that this was taken from you!
So sad that is happening people are crazy. I do have to say the pallet is beautiful and I so wish you could of launched it, I would of purchased it because I use volume one all the time and hit pan on a few shades already. I loved the esthetic and I hope you can change the name and rebrand and  ring your vision back to life you know you have the support and we would all buy anything you put out. I trust you!
I never even heard about this “drama” ! I’m totally out of the loop. Thank you Tati for the update though 🥰🥰🥰
I look forward to buying your creation, I cannot stand the idea of being robbed of your own work...
Things will get better and hopefully we can enjoy some new shadow’s soon
I hope you decide to bring back Tati beauty. I hit pan on so many colors of my pallet. That still to this day is my preferred pallet.
You’re looking extra beautiful! That Texas sunshine seems to be working it’s magic ❤️
Excuse me while I just mention you look stunning, Tati 💖
Thank you for sharing this with us. I’m so sorry you’re dealing with it though! Sending you lots of love. Side note you look beautiful in this video (as always!)
We are ready when you are Tati!! Patiently waiting for your future creations. Its been a tough road and im sure more than we could ever imagine. God bless and only great thi gs to come ♡
Wait, I thought Tati beauty was closed forever meaning I totally missed out. Is your original palette going to come back???
Whenever the time comes- I will be there to buy your palette! Because let me tell you, yours is one of 2 palettes I have. I get the best use out of it. And this concept for the “spring” colors, aahhhh I want it
I want to petition to bring Tati Beauty back! This was the best brand with the best cosmetics!
We have food fraud so I have to assume FSMA covers the beauty world too. The FBI will probably get involved. Such a shame a shady distribution center would do this. At one company I worked for, we used to have to have someone onsite to visually see the destruction before they bought the DC's and had better control. If you re-launch or re-brand maybe something you can have your quality control team handle.
you look beautiful and healthy.. keep working
Please never stop creating. Your Palette was incredible!!! Don't give up on your beauty dreams. 🦋 we believe in you!!
What a pity...I would have loved to get that palette!!!!
That palette is so beautiful!!❤️ I am so bummed it's not going to come out.😭 I still love my Volume 1 palette!! I am so sad that your line is not producing products because I absolutely loved your first 2 launches. I also still use your blending pads. You know so much and your products showed that. If I feel this bad, I can't imagine how you feel. I still have hope that one day you will again start producing products. You know we would all be here for it!!❤️
This makes me so sad for you Tati. I love you original palette and I know I would’ve loved this one too. I hope you do come back out with a brand. Makes me excited to see and I hope and pray you come back and kill it even more. Love you.
I’m sorry this happened to you. It must be heartbreaking.
Tati your Textured Neutrals Vol 1 is the absolute best palate. In fact Allie Glines did a video about what her viewers favorite palate was and yours was definitely #1! Honestly, it’s sad you can’t continue to share your vision and collections with Tati Beauty… but I know you will come back from this and I look forward to seeing what else you will create in the future! Even if it was just the one palate, it was such a beauty and I feel honored I was able to receive it!!
Tati is so pretty...like a natural beauty...even her hair looks effortlessly perfect! I think that there is so much more left for Tati in the beauty world. Her coming back was the first step and I think, well I hope, that she sees that her fans are still here for her and still interested in what she has to say and still enjoy her content. I personally like the vlog style videos that she's added to her channel. It's a really great candid look into her life and more into her personality outside of the beauty industry. She's obviously very intelligent and well rounded. Can't lie I'm a little jealous bc she is the woman that I strive to be! 💖
Tati!!! Please just make another brand 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗 we need a strong makeup guru! We want your product on our faces! You have talent!!!  We love you! Please come Back when you are ready! We will be here to support you!
Why cant you get to the point!!
If a product wasn’t meant to be sold and wasn’t officially approved, why were there so many made that are now being illegally sold?  Is that normal is product development (to make a bunch of not-yet-approved product)?  Legit question here; not being accusatory at all. Love you Tati. We miss Tati beauty.
Ugh but I want it 😅 My Tati beauty palette is to this day my favorite palette I own! I pray that you can rebuild and eventually create new cosmetics and I will wait and support you the day that that happens!
I need Tati Beauty back 😭😭😭😭😭😭🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I get that this video is meant to be conversational and maybe it's just me, but I feel like you're making the same point over and over again in the opening. You were very clear that this wasn't the product that was ever going to market. You didn't need to keep repeating it.
I seriously feel like Tati has some shape shifting powers
BORING
I'm really digging this lighting and the background
I’m so horrified for you.I hope you catch those Duckers!
Gosh I do LOVE this color story though, I hope you can bring it to us in the future!!!
I'm still bummed I missed the first palette, it was so beautiful and perfect. sigh... I really hope Tati Beauty comes back.
I live for volume one. Its literally the only pallet I use. I am so sorry this was stolen from you. I really wish you will sell your makeup again.
Tati Beauty Vol 1 palette was, is and will always be THE BEST palette to launch, like EVER!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤ I’m so happy I got to buy it while the brand was still existing. Hugs your way Tati!! 🤗
ok idc what happens i will always love this woman lol she’s so angelic
I'm 100% sad that I was unable to get the other Tati palette....................... 😭😭😭😭😭😭 ***the actual palette
Did anyone else notice the painting in the background is in the same colour as Tati's eyes? 😍
tati is literally glowing omg
Is there a place to buy the volume 1
I have not bought any other palette since the volume 1 drop. I love it with all my heart ❤️
The hair, the makeup, the lighting, the background, the vulnerability....I love everything about this video! Is this the new background?
i have to wonder if all this influx of these "influencers" is what destroyed the REAL OG makeup lines like Tati and MakeUP Geek.  This is so sad that people are so darn evil. The women will rise to the top again -- cant wait to see what God has in store for them.
Looking forward to whatever you decide to do next!!!! 💜
I still have and cherish my Tati Beauty vol 1 pallet! I'm afraid to use it because I know it cannot be replaced...sadly! But I really would have loved that cool toned pallet! That's my jam! I really hope one day you can bring your brand back to us. Sending you love and positive vibes through this!!
So sad 😞 that they stole your dream. Was never able to buy the first one due to import taxes. Just happy your looking so much better and that you are back online.
Insult to injury!  I hope they get their just rewards!  Love you!  Love your first palette.  I would have loved this one as well but won’t touch it with a ten foot pole!  😊🙏👍
We must find a way somehow some way to have you do more of these shadows.. literally right up there with Natasha denona!! And the different textures were perfect!! Nothing like sequins anywhere!!
It's very sad this didn't come to fruition, but I know more good things are coming your way and I'm excited to see what they will be. In the meantime, have you considered a YouTube merch line? I'd love nothing more than a shirt or hoodie to show my Tati love.
Aww :((
WHY SHOW THIS THO? NO ONE CAN EVEN HAVE IT. WHAT'S THE POINT? HERE'S A PALETTE THAT I ALMOST LAUNCHED, BUT I DIDN'T.... I LOVE YOU TATI, BUT TATI BEAUTY IS GONE, SO LET IT BE.
Tati really went through her reputation era and people sat there and laughed, ridiculed, and mocked. Happy to say I was never a part of that crowd. And now just like Taylor had her work stolen from her, Tati had her work stolen too. I can see why Tati is a TS fan too. 🥰
First of all, I just want to say I commend you on your courage to tactfully address this situation. Second, I am so sorry this happened.   I have my volume 1 palette and cherish it! I use it only for special occasions!   So happy you’re on this new journey. If I see your “what would have been” palette up for sell somewhere, I’ll report it.
I still love love my Blendful I have 3 and they have held up I bought them at launch and so sad I can buy more but we support you! Looking forward to your future Tati!! ❤️
I can’t wait to see where the future takes you! I hope to see some makeup form you in the future! Still regretting not buying the original pallete!
I looooove my Tati pallet 💋💋💋💋
So sorry your palette was stolen.😔 I really hope you get back to creating makeup someday❤
Thank you for sharing with us. What a devastating event to happen with the palette. And yet, somehow I have a feeling that whatever venture lies before you is so amazing and so big that it needs all of you. Tati Beauty was the stepping stone to get you there. Can’t wait to see! I’ll be following.
Oh I got so excited when I saw the title! I’m hopeful for a different beauty brand from you in the future.
I don't like neutrals but that palette would have 100% had my $$$. Tati please relaunch your brand!!!!!! Look at all the support it would obviously do good.
Thanks Tati! 💙
why.. aren't u better than this... you need to stop...
Tati whatever you choose to do in the future May you have overflowing success 🤗 Life’s balance of bittersweet moments and blessings are shards of treasure. Keep hanging in there!! 💕
There's no doubt in my mind that you'll launch another company and I'll be here for it. I still use your palette all of the time...it's so good!
What is she talking about when she mentions the butterflies
i wish you get your bauty brand back and running one day
im so sad i never got to try tati beauty ive watched tati since i was little wouldve been a dream come true, can i still buy it anywhere ?
The vision you had was beautiful!! Your sell out pallet is still the best thing EVER 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
So sorry this happened to you!! Prayers for the future in whatever you do!!!  Much love to you and James!!
If it just so happens you get to build a brand again one day, or that one specifically, go with the name Tati 2.0!
I know that whatever is in store for your future is going to amazing and amazingly creative and I am here for it!! Best of luck to you in your future endeavors and cannot wait to be a customer of yours again in the future!!
You’ve been hit on every angle and you have persevered in a way that inspires others to do the same. God Bless! 😘
People who know you love every aspect of you and don't fall into useless gossip from haters🥰
Those people complaining about Tati actually showing the palette late into the video, and that before that there’s “too much talking”…. Uh, you are obviously not one of the usual fans, because her true fans are here to see Tati, she can talk about whatever she wants, whenever she wants. It is just as enjoyable, we are here for her vibe. Also @Tati, when you mentioned that you were in “fantasy land” back then, I kept hearing the Mariah Carey song in my mind. I wish I could have been able to buy that gorgeous palette.
You look the happiest you have looked in a long time!
We want this so much 😭😭 It would have been epic.
I’m devastated that this never came to market because I would have loved this
i h ave a feeling the one that sells her colection is her EX PARTNER!
I don’t usually buy products or palates… but your palate launched on my birthday! October 25th! 💜 I’m waiting for your comeback and I’ll be there for it!
You’re the first YouTube person I ever purchased anything from. I was completely in love with your first eyeshadow makeup and I still have it!!! I hope you will continue to make more in the future
OMG! YES! ENCHANTED TEXTURES WOULD'VE BEEN MY 100% PERFECT PALETTE! HANDS DOWN! 🥺😢😭
Some of y'all in the comments are pretty dense.  It's embarrassing.
If the palette wasn’t the final version, why were so many made? Just curious
Come on there is gotta be a way that you can bring back Tati Beauty … even if you start a “ mom & pop “ shop outta your garage & you can only sale 1000 pallets at a time … your product was good … don’t let nightmares from the past destroy your future dreams  …
Did I just hear her tell us not to go online and purchase it because it would be supporting theft and then hear her say she bought it online? Did I misunderstand something?
So much click bait these days Tati. Its an 18 min vid and you show the one thing we care about at 14 mins in…? What was this? A stunt. And the picture of the thing in your thumbnail doesn’t even match the product you show in the vid. Oy.
A mariah carey vibe with this pallete🙂
The palette reveal is at 11:25 minutes in. Lots of talking before that. Enjoy
Anyone wanna sell me a VOL1 I want to use it on my wedding day so badly 😔😔💔💔
You are doing so well: I am so proud of you, you look beautiful and I am so proud of you for keeping your calm . You are amazing
5 minutes into the video and I’m almost ready to turn it off.
I’m so sad all your fantasy and creations, your baby was stolen and that it never came to life. That hurts big time! If you ever want to do a new palette, please, please, please DO NOT use the same matt outside on the palette. Everyone who has your first one knows how it literally eats powder and dust, always looks dirty, even after I newly wiped it down. It is matt grayish black, not very appealing, or luxurious. Literally anything will be better than that.
this was hard to watch... you should have been able to keep dreaming in your butterfly land, everyone deserves to follow their dreams. I am very upset about how someone ended this for you
so sad to hear you talk about your dream and vision and we will never get to see it. I never want to use my palette because I don't want to ever run out. 😢
I’m so happy that you are feeling so refresh and creative again. Your path is your own and I can’t wait to see where you go from here! 💜
She's just so precious. I can only imagine how she feels, humbled, pissed, and utterly powerless. Hang tuff baby!!! 😎🙏😘You got THIS ONE from jump 🦘!!! 🌹🌹🌹
Palette reveal @ 11:23
If you were just going to waste it, I’m glad it got stolen. 😏
Wait...what? Destroying perfectly good product seems incredibly wasteful, environmentally speaking. Couldn’t you donate it to battered women’s shelters or Christmas gifts for underprivileged teenagers?
I hope you start posting all the makeup you wear in each video again.   It’s stunning!
Well I thought she was launching something I don’t like misleading video titles tats 😑🙄😑🙄
You should put your makeup through Halo… that would be fantastic… love you!! 💕😁
The volume 1 palette is still my # 1.  I am not an everyday makeup wearer, so it’s lasting me a long time.  I wish I could order another one for the future.
Hope it all sorts itself out soon Tati and the LOW LIFE THEIVES are EXPOSED
Somewhere i feel sad for her. Though I admire her strength. 💜
So glad God brought you Texas as soon as He could ❤️🤍💙
I am so sorry this is happening to you. But I am LOVING how positive and strong you are being. Justice will prevail. I know it🙏🏻💙💖
I can't believe this 😭😭😭 this really looks like the palette of my dreams 😍😭 and I'm still trying to get the volume one but of course there's no one here in Germany selling his palette cause everyone loves it 😭 much love to you Tati, ❤️ it's horrible what you've been through!!
Aww, that was a very beautiful colour story, I would have liked to see it complete. I'll look forward to your next :)
Can someone catch me up! When did and why did she move to Texas? She looks so happy!!!
I get that she doesn't want us to buy the palettes and support theft, but I find it odd that she bought it herself? I'm not gonna buy it anyway but that was confusing to me Still, it's a beautiful palette and I'm sad that Tati Beauty had to close its doors. I was excited to see where you wanted to go with the brand when it first launched
not buying the tati beauty eyeshadow palette is one of my biggest makeup regrets 🥲🥺
OPEN ANOTHER TATI COLLECTION!!!! please!!!
I bought Tati volume 1 from Italy the most expensive palette in my entire life worth every cent I spent never ever regretted everything you will create is a must have! Totally faith in you and in your talent! Love you so much ❤️
You go girl
If Sam was still here, I feel like she would have been on top of the leak!  😩.
Does anyone know how her litigation situation is going? Is it over yet?
You will succeed‼I can not imagine it no other way. It's in your nature🤗Queen⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐👑
I really hope from the bottom of my heart, that you’ll create again! I love your first palette and it’s definitely the most beautiful that I own. I’d love to see Teint products from you! New palettes and even a Tati Perfume would be a dream of mine. I believe in you and so many people are with me on that ❤️‍🔥
Is this a new camera? Cause wow Tati!😍
We need Tati Beauty 2.0…just take all my money if that happens
Loving the Texas vibes in the background 🐎🌵
Ugh. Tati made mistakes. Tati is human. Hold her accountable, fine.  Her mistakes were those than any of us can make. She is clearly just a woman with a passion and a vision. Many have done much worse and not been held responsible even in the slightest way. Is it because she's a woman? is it because she's over 35?   I think the problem was, it was so clear she has integrity, genuine passion and a real love for her craft. That made her stand out so much amongst the disingenuous self serving peers that when she made a mistake it was magnified  beyond reason.   As a gay guy I want to say I'm disgusted that some big beauty gurus who happen to be  gay men still have massive platforms despite proveably disgraceful (or even criminal )actions.  (Not Manny MUA, he was done dirty and still he's clearly worked on evolving as a person and deserves his flowers.)
I was really sad that Tati beauty is no more, but I still have my 1st palette and my blendifuls and I guard them with my life!! As always i support you whatever you do, and wish you all the success in the world !! ❤️❤️
How do you think this was stolen? How did you find out?
Oh Tati !!!! I wish you well and maybe one day you will rebrand ! I hope so I would love to be able to get your products ! ❤️❤️❤️
LOVE MY BLENDIFUL..... thank goodness i bought an extra one...
Tati, I love your first pallette and was so proud of you when you launched it. I know life has its twists and turns and we all have to adjust to them. I am still proud of you and how you have chosen to maneuver what the universe has sent your way. All this has been a journey for you to learn from and prioritize what is most important to you. Remember love and happiness is what is most important. I am so proud of how you have taken your journey.  Love and Light to you and your family.
Such a lovely soul inside and out ! Looks so great - that hair xx
Always proud of you Tati
Okay I need help understanding because I know nothing about makeup production. If the pallette wasn't ready for market, why was there a large quantity of pallettes in the final packaging produced?
Watching as I use my blendiful to apply my make up ❤️
Sucks people do this to you !
I’m just wondering how there could be more then one palette if the original one was not signed off on? HAs someone stolen the one palette then copied it to resell?
Love your set up!!! Your skin looks flawless
I wish you health peace and happiness
Can someone recap? What happened?
I have volume 1 and still love it. I did not even know of this stolen palette, so some of us are getting it from the source… no worries Tati!
Would you open another Tati Beauty company but rename it something different? Seems a shame so many good ideas are just being left on the shelf. Your ex business partner done you really dirty. Also, you look gorgeous. Love from ireland x
I still have my v1 and it's a staple in my makeup collection, can't wait to see if you do come out with another one would buy all your makeup if the products were as good as the v1 pallet 🥰❤️
I don’t get it - this Palette was not ready to sell and not approved by you - so why are there so many Palettes? Did you produced it just to throw it away? And you buying this Palette and support it is kind of weird
Your Vol 1 palette is my favorite palette. That formula was everything. I hope you take your talents somewhere else and create another palette girl ❤️
Tati you are beautiful inside and out. Bless you and the calmness you are showing in trying times. Remember that you can lay your head down at night because your honest. There will always be the dishonest ones trying rob the ones that work hard to make a living. 😘😘
Im so sorry you have had to deal with this!!!! But you are a creative genius and I love my volume 1 palette
I for one never left in my support for you. I have my Tati Palette Vol. 1 and still love it. I will support any creative thing you want to put out in the future. I checked your channel regularly when you had last posted to seeing you come back again. I never doubted your return. I'll still be here for whatever you may launch in the future. I hope you realize just how much your true followers still love you. I never purchased this 2nd palette because you would have told us first that it was from you. You have a forever fan in me.  I'm sorry someone stole your 2nd palette and sold it. You are looking beautiful and radiant. God is good and I pray for a different announcement soon.  🤰  🙏
That palette would’ve been so gorgeous. I’m sorry you had this dream stripped from you. I absolutely love my Vol 1 palette. I wish I would’ve gotten the blendiful. Do you have any recommendations for something similar to that?
Oh dear lord, why do these things happen? Tati, you are a good person and a truly creative one. I have two of the Textured Neutrals I and am hoarding them so they will last. I so wish you could have released that Enchanted palette yourself so you could enjoy the benefits of your vision. You are handling this as well as anyone could. Hopefully you can do something along these lines in the near future and put this nightmare behind you. Hugs.💖💖
Tati… this palette is beautiful🤩 I would have loved to purchase it… That‘s so sad… pls make it happen one day. No support for thefts though!!
This made me sad. I wish I could buy that beautiful palette. I think I would be rather ignorant and not knowing it existed instead of being bummed.
Love you 💜
Congratulations Tati ! This palette looks fantastic! Good luck for your business
Tati I can tell you are much happier now in Texas!! I’m glad to see your spirit happy!!! Omg those pallets that didn’t come out are beautiful ❤️❤️
I'm love and support ❤ you Tati! P.s. I love the horse behind your shoulder! 👀 🐎  🐴 💖
It really sucks that your product was stolen! I'm so sorry that happened to you! Hopefully in the future we can see Tati Beauty again. I never got the chance to buy the first palette and would love too 🥰
You are absolutely stunning Tati😍
You took way to long to get to any point at all.  Not sure what I am not supposed  to buy
Tati...u r amazing inspiring 👏 🙌 ❤️ ✨️ and beautiful with so much grace. Thank u for sharing and cleaning up sum1 else's mess...sorry for ur damage of creativity but u will rise...love ur Chanel
Oh this is sad..
Why did they make hundreds of palettes if it wasn't ready? Sounds wasteful
I still love ❤️ and use my Tati vol.1 palette and I would have loved to use the vol.2 3,4,5,ect.

So sorry you had to do this Tati x
Tati I was never able to Purchase ur palette due to hardships but now that I’m Stable and want it ITS GONE 😭 please make shadows again! PLEASE!!!!!
Everything about this video reminds me of Taylor like enchanted? Butterfly? I mean if she released this pallette it will be amazing because she been thru alot already and releasing this pallette own her own will be amazing thing and new chapter this is what i feel..
Tati saying thank you for watching, but THANK YOU for coming back!!!! YouTube wasn’t the same without you! Always shine through girl, you’re more special than you know. Much love 💕
We are always going to be here Tati!!! 😘😘😘😘😘
I carry the volume 1 palette with me EVERYWHERE and was so upset when Tati beauty shut down - patiently waiting for your next makeup venture 🥰
Thank you for the warning ...and may justice be served on these thieves!
What, swat meets? ...is that still a thing?
You are such a gorgeous big fan of yours  Love your palette, your creation always on point.
It was the almost. I am sorry this happened. Your amazing!
I sooo wish I had been able to afford to buy the first palette. But it was beautiful and this one, sadly, looks just as beautiful. I hate this is happening. I don’t know why  people can’t leave well enough alone. I hope things get figured out.
Hey Tati things happen for a reason and as you say who knows what the future will bring   Other than  your beautiful personality and amazing make up   What has always been outstanding to me is your hair   I love your hair and try to keep my hair looking amazing and long and beautiful  i would buy the shit out out of your hair products…just saying if that is EVER a route… wink wink 😉  Stay true to yourself as you have done You are an amazing woman A true role model ❤️ You are blessed
I don’t even wear bright colours, especially now I’m older, but OOFT I would have set my alarm and waited by my phone to have bought that palette the second it was launched. Wowee it’s stunnnnnnning. I hope you get the chance to continue with your makeup launches in future. X
Hi Tati,  I'm sorry that this happened.   People do shitty things.   Side note, I love the lipcolor you're wearing.... can you share what products you used?
another influencer line...no thanks ,we love you for your makeup videos
OMGG. You look beautiful 🥰✨ also I welcome to Texas!!! 🥳
I really hope you will bring out products in the future, I LOVE the vol.1 palette. Wishing you all the best.
I dont understand why you cant just carry on from the first pallet
If this was not the final product, why were there so many of them? Why produce so much pallettes not intended for sale?
there is something sweet about this palette even now.
Tati, you went through some bad things. We all do. But you are NOT DONE. You have so much more to create. And I am here for it.  We all are. Don’t stress. It will happen. And all good thjngs will come. Love you!
I bought the Tati beauty volume 1 and to be honest haven’t touched it because I am too afraid it will hit pan and won’t obviously be able to get another one
The formula was so great on the first one, I would have definitely gotten the second volume. I excited for what’s to come 👏🏻
I would have definitely bought this! Soooo dreamy, so stunning!  But buying something what was stolen from you… or from anyone - disgusting!
WHAT ?? Oh my gosh what is happening ??? Am i really seeing right ????? 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Please keep sharing these stories, it’s so fascinating for me as a business owner and creator. And don’t give up that dream. My Tati fund is waiting to spend it on your next line!!
❤ God has beautiful things in store for you Tati! Keep the faith. ❤️
It really is a sad story but i am hopeful your brand will come back to the world again <3 I never got the chance to try your product and I really would love to! Becasue i love make-up and because I support you <3
Much love Tati! 💜
I would have loved to have this palette in my make-up collection ❤ sending you much love ⭐
Can’t wait to see what’s next! Whatever it is ☺️💗
OMFG Tati is gorgeous 😶❤
We are here for you Tati 🙌🏻🇬🇧♥️ Would never buy it unless you made it ! 💜❤️💕💜❤️💕💜❤️💕💜❤️💕
Understandable, Tati! I have to say though, your creativity is immaculate. Would have been my favorite palette, for sure. The demo looks incredible! Greens 💚
Can't wait to buy the Tati Beauty II! But I will wait for the real product!
I am so sad I never got to try this. It is stunning! Your neutrals palette will always be one of my top faves <3
So true I could not stop looking aswel..... And your skin is amazing
The only good thing is that the product didn't go to waste. Don't und me wrong. Because of safety reasons I don't think it's safe and I think being destroyed was the safer option. Just trying to see a good in this stupid situation
This is so gorgeous and it’s exactly what I was waiting for in a next launch from you after Textured Neutrals FAR exceeded my expectations. I’m still devastated that we don’t have Tati Beauty anymore and I hope you’ll be able to bring out something new and share your creativity with us again. Also, as much as I want to put my hands all over that palette and own more of your pressed glitters, I will not be hunting down stolen goods to buy. My enchanted textured life will have to live in my dreams 💕
Congratulations
I’m so sorry that this beautiful idea and product was stolen from you! Sending love! ❤️
Cause you’re the goat 😂❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hi will the volume 1 palette come back?
I was fortunate to get your first palette after it sold out the first time. It is stunning. I’m afraid to use it because I can’t repurchase it when I run out. I hope everything goes well for you and your future plans. Hopefully, one day, you can relaunch your makeup brand again. Side note: it is literally pathetic the things people do to others.
Noooo, I would so buy the cool toned Neutrals😫 such a pity:(
This is so heartbreaking, i have so much hope for Tati Beauty.    LOVE U TATI, i pray that you get to continue your vision in the future 💚💙💛🧡🤎💜
cant wait till you have a new makeup brand
I have my Tati Volume 1, I use it literally almost everyday. I LOVE it! Praying one day to there will be another one, best eyeshadow I've ever used.
Tati! Love love love U thank you for sharing you are spot on many people do not understand the workings of starting out as a small business owner and the hours and no days off...etc...trying to build and getting your business on track to help people no matter ...etc...I would pay if you wrote a how to beauty book to do this and that...you are the Best...you are fun smart, and top of the line....in the Beauty Industry seriously...we LOVE U...we would love to purchase your "art of beauty" we have faith in your ability to do whatever you put your mind to do..Bless your heart ❤
I hope the future brings us more Beauty Products by Tati 😭 I love my Textured Neutrals Palette and the Blendiful so, so much and it's killing me that there would have been so many, so beautiful palette ideas that won't come out. 🥲💔
Tati, please drop your hair routine and products 🥲
Tati got that garnier nutrisse L’Oréal commercial hair 😍😍
You have come so far since your LA days. Been watching you for 10 years and I love how you survive and thrive!! You look incredible as well! I guess peace of mind is your new beauty secret!
Wow!  What a freakin nightmare and you are handling it so well (publicly…I really hope you’ve screamed and dropped many F Bombs privately 🤗).  And Im sure im not the only one who has an educated guess at “who done it”.  I have to say Tati, you’ve always come across as very professional but now I see and feel how graceful you are…Not something ine sees on the Internet or in real life very often…so impressive! K…ima go buy the pallet now…LOL…JK!!! No Way…Absolutely NOT!  ❤️
But whyyy wouldn’t you do a new makeup line with a stronger security team, you KNOW it would be successful! You are the QUEEEEN of make up ❤️
I really hope one day Tati Beauty returns. Textured Neutrals Vol. 1 is my all time favourite palette and I get so many compliments when I wear it and I would love to buy and support your other collections. Sending love <3
Tati i wish u all the best <3 When u launch ur new makeup brand, i will, and i bet alot of subscribers, will still buy the volume 2 palette even if its leaked!
The palette would have been great, but I can't wait to see what you will create next ❤
Said in style,,we will all be waiting when your ready to bring us something new 😁💜
You look phenomenal! Texas agrees with you!!  That palette! What the?? Absolutely gorgeous! I pray one day you will once again be able to have a hand in creating things like this. My Tati Volume 1 (bought 3 and gifted one to a friend) is stellar! Every single pan is perfection! Blessings to you!
Ugh. You have the best vision and I trust you. You deserve to have your own brand, and I’m so sad this all has happened to you. I hope one day you have a different story to tell us regarding your own brand. We love you Tati ❤️
Definitely feel like your not finished! I'm so glad this isn't the end. Just a pause in the story. Said by someone who doesn't even wear makeup
I would have bought it if you made it. I'm all about the colours.
I saw that palette for sale on Facebook a few months ago and was like "wtf??" The ad was quickly taken down but it makes me sad that somebody stole that and is now selling it. I'm sorry you never got to take it to market cuz it looked like it would've been a beautiful concept.
Sorry you have been through so much.
💜💜💜Xo’s💜💜💜
Good gracious - I had not heard of this pallet and I cannot believe you are having to deal with yet more bullshit.  God bless you - DAMN what a gorgeous scheme you had there. ♥ I really hate the SOB who blocked your dreams from coming true on Tati Beauty. ♥  I must say you look good however. MUCH happier now.  ♥
So glad I was very lucky to get my hands on the Tati Beauty palette volume 1 definitely one of my favourites I don’t want to use coz I know I cannot repurchase
What is she trying to say besides......
Why don't you keep with the brand I just don't get it :'( we all loved the palette!
I’d loved to have purchased your Vol. 1 Palette as it was for sale, I regret it till this day! But that reassure me, I won’t miss it next time you lunch a palette! Oh my god, it is just sooo beautiful!!!! Please Tati, make more of this beauty in the near future!! 💖💖
Tati your palette is my all time favorite, period!
Keep rising and don’t let the darkness in this world bring you down! Keep living your best life and hold onto your peace! ❤️
Volume 1 is the best makeup ever. I compare with other pallettes and is impossible to other brands to win
GlamGuru Beauty has a nice ring to it for the future 💕💕
❤️❤️
The name and colour scheme was going to be absolutely amazing! It’s such a shame you had this brilliant opportunity stolen from you.  It would be so amazing if you went back to making cosmetics. I was hoping you was going to bring out a concealer as I don’t wear much makeup but would purchase a concealer from you in a heartbeat.
I still have and use my gorgeous Tati vol. 1 palette!!!!! I hope you please please come out with another company or something. That palette is stunning!!!!!!❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Tati! We need a new makeup brand!!! Why can you not launch another brand? I hope it's not due to legal clauses.
I used my original textured neutrals sparingly cause I don’t want to run out of it, I wish that collection would have happened cause it looked GORGEOUS
Damn I thought you were coming back with a new makeup company lol
I really hope Tati will start new makeup company soon ♥
thank you so much for sharing this with us ❤️ it looked so pretty thoo
I didnt get the chance to but The textured Neutrals vol I and i Love it so much. Anyone has a spare one or knows where can i get one? Im in italy
Man that blue row though! That alone would have convinced me to buy it! Also the colour story is very much in style especially that lime green is very popular in palettes now
Honestly this would be heartbreaking for any artist to see their work ripped off this way, but even harder given the context. Hang in there Tati ♥️ You are truly just beginning and there’s so much more to come for and from you!
I had volume one but it got wet and I had to throw it away after having it only a short time I was devastated 😢
This might be a dumb question, but were the palettes physically stolen from Tati Beauty's manufacturing facilities or was the concept/design/color scheme stolen? Either way that is so terrible!
I'm so sad that my tati palette I got from the very first launch was broken because my child got ahold of it. I would have loved to buy the next launch too. But keep it higher up away from my kids 😂
I really hope she's gonna make more make up, I still have my Tati Beauty palette and i LOVE it, it's my favorite
Love the execution of this tricky video, Tati. Somehow you were able to stay chill and upbeat and not fuel any kind of drama-vibes or negativity. I know you are in a better place in your life than before and have no doubt you have a bright future ahead of you ❤️. I laughed when you talked about your butterfly period- I remember being so confused with all the butterfly imagery you had going on- it was like your account got hacked or something because you were like a different person all of a sudden 😅. Although beautiful, I guess the Enchanted palette was just not meant to be. 💜
love you tati. sorry this happened to you. we love you and can't wait to see what's next from you.
So sorry to hear that happened.. But glad to see you so happy in Texas. I am sure you will spoil yourself and us all with loaaads of quality products in the future. Lots of love xoxo
Ok  , blessings for whatever is next.. I'll be here.🦥 hanging about like a sloth. We need a new emoji for a personal touch now that blue butterflies are over.☀️
I would have bought that palette
It's never over unless or until *we* give up on our dreams, our purpose, ourselves. And now I'm about to go ultra cheesy here, and quote the title of a favorite song that means a lot to me: Journey's "Don't Stop Believing" 💙💜💙
I'm so sad. I wish this whole situation never happened. I loved your brand ♡❤️
The brand was shut down but thousands of pallets were still made?  I dont get it.
That enchanted textures palette is fucking stunning 😍😍. Shame on those people for stealing your ideas!!
Oh my word I almost got excited and thought Tati beauty is back 😭😭😭😭😭
I would be furious if this had happaned to me and my brand! This is unbelievable! I hope this other stakeholder did not sale this behind your back because he thought is it ethical since this version of the palette was never going to reach the market...unbelievable
Dang Tati I'm so sorry this is happening to you! I wanted your first pallet soooo bad, and I think this new pallet would have been beautiful too. I really hope you make a new beauty line! I really want that original pallet 😭 and I'll for sure buy whatever you make next. 🥰❤️
Please launch this palette and the cool toned textured neutrals!! 😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
We love you Tati ❤
Tati you look beautiful ! Thank you for sharing something which must be difficult to talk about. The future is patiently waiting for you, your ideas and ambitions and so are we 💕💕
volume 1 is my favorite pallet ever!!! I try not to use it because I've hit pan In alot of shades I hope you re release it one day!
It's sad that this never got the release it deserved, as it looks stunning. And frankly Tati, despite now being in a place where I feel good with my makeup collection and being like "I have bought so much makeup I never use I never need to buy makeup again", I would still buy everything you make because I KNOW it's gonna be worth it. Here's to hoping one day we'll see your creations in our bathroom vanities again!
So sad that this happened. It would have been awesome
U picked a Great hair color girl did u get it trimmed too?
WE WANT THAT PALETTE!
I can see why you vibed so much with that Milani Flora palette!
Could you not relaunch it under another avenue or name... Such a shame as it was a great formula and brand something a bit different
Tati, We See This Palette, We Want This Palette From You 🎨 Please Somehow Someway Bring This Palette Out When You Can And Release It To All Of Us Who Love The Enchanted Textures Palette That You Can Create 🦋
Wait I'm confused HOW do some people have it then? Is her ex partner selling her items or something im so confused!
It's great to see you still creating and finding your joy and peace. I'm sad for the almost was palette but selfishly because I own the OG palette and it is so so so good and the blendiful and I truly enjoy them. Have a great day.
🦋 Butterfly’s are very special, they probably came to you in a time where you needed a lot of spiritual support. In my culture, butterflies 🦋 are a sign of guardian angels around you. You were being watched over.
My worry is that now this video exists with actual footage of Tati holding the palette, it’s going to be even easier for people to sell the stolen ones.
I'm here for it Tati 😊 can't wait to see where your creativity takes you!
Still dont have volume1 :(
You're so brave go on creat move get what you want for your future and never mind you can do it
So sad to hear this has happened & hope ongoing investigation brings closure soon. Love my original palette & bought several blendiful puffs. Was so looking forward to new products, so maybe this can happen again in the future 🤞🤞. If so, I'm definitely in the queue.❤💕
I am so truly sad it didn't work out for Tati Beauty and truly hope to see makeup products from you in the near future <3
I absolutely loved your vision for Tati Beauty ❤️ I hope you will eventually still follow through with that and even with this same palette. And I love the idea of having the palettes be like a coffee table book! All I need in my life is for you to create a makeup brand 😍
Oh, man... I would have bought your palette, those photos you showed around 11:23 are GORGEOUS!
but wait.... so it wasn't approved and finished, yet you had bulks of it? why would you have so many if it wasn't yet going to be sold?
It would have been a beautiful palette launch... still love your first launch palette!
Jesus you are so incredibly strong! God bless you! Xoxo 😘
I really have no clue about how much it costs to create makeup of your quality level, but if there was a go fund me to restart TB, I wouldn't be the only one to chip in. You don't want to know what I'd pay to finally get a decent neutral/cool toned palette 😅
I purchased 3 of the original palettes, and 2 sets of blendifuls. I love my blendifuls and kept both sets, yes!!! And gifted my daughters each a palette. I definitely would have ordered that fantasy palette, it looks like color done the grown up way, 🤪
Sadly there are always those who take advantages of situations like this and sell stolen products via social media etc.  I hope that the culprits are caught and prosecuted.  You look beautiful today.
Sending prayers 🙏 be strong 💪 f the haters ❤
Still have my Tati palette and I’ve hit pan on so many shades. Wish I could get my hands on another one cuz I loved the glitters a lot.
I know you said you created it when you were in a different head space but just to let you know, it is stun.ning. Even if the vibe is not you right now, the creativity and beauty still flowed from you. Gorgeous.
WOULD HAVE BOUGHT IT .........
We love your videos!!! It stinks people are so horrible!!! Thanks for letting us know what’s going on in your life!!!
I love my volume 1 pallet. I’m so sad I won’t be able to repurchase it, but I’ll cherish it as long as I have it.
Still will never forget your Tati Beauty launch! Love you so much! You are GLOWING! 💕
I am still praying for you to make more eyeshadows. I LOVE what you created, and after this transformation, I'm certain that you'd only create something even better than before.
I hope Tati can go to sleep at night knowing the original Tati palette was one of the best ever to exist. Right up there with big name brands! If I could have one palette forever it would be that palette. 10000%
Tati that colour story would definitely sell in today’s makeup market I am an Indie Brand lover of makeup especially eyeshadow I want colour I want all the wet looking sparkly Duochrome and Multi chrome beautiful stunning goodness, I’m not the biggest lover of glitter itself as in loose glitter to fall all over my face even with glitter glue/primer . Glitter in a stable formula of its own mixing medium built into it oh heck yes ! That green row made me take in a big breath and whoa 😳 my personal favourite colours are those murky grungy greens swampy yellows , mustards , greens , brownish olives, that’s my vibes or taking true neutrals in the crease a dark colour on the outer edge into the crease a bit then taking a duo or multi chrome  normally 2 all over my lid in a angled / kinda way it’s flattering on my eye shape. I love colour but the murky grunge colours have my heart ♥️, if the opportunity for you to create products again have no fear we will be lined up just waiting for the minutes to tick down so we can add to cart you would as they say “ break the internet “ with all the people wanting the products. If you came out with Base Products oh my Lord !! ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ Foundation, Concealer, Colour Correctors, Pore Blurring Products, Powders loose and pressed , matt ones , glowy ones , under eye brighting powders , Bronzers oh man can we just for a minute imagine the quality how it would be skin like but with coverage, tinted the shade ranges not just fair to deep but all the different undertones goodness gracious how amazing would that be!!! If only it could happen the Universe is truly amazing and vast who knows what could happen but the support would be absolutely freaking vast , huge , massive. XOXO .
I’m still sad that I never got to have a Vol. 1 Palette 🥲
I use my volume 1 for weddings. It’s been a great palette for my brides 💕
Pallet reveal at 14:06
GO TATI!
Or just do your own thing again! We will buy it
I really hope you can make another palette I would 100% buy it. I bought the volume 1 palette and I love it more than anything!
Must have been the butterfly effect lol
I wish i could buy the firts palette
Loooove 🥰 can't wait until James Tati Cosmetics. Just a thought 💋
I was so excited when I saw the title of the video. Love the first pallet.
I’m so sorry to hear that. I can’t imagine how it must feel to have your intellectual property stolen!!! And you still give this vibe of apologising gracefully for something you didn’t even do. If I were you, I’d be livid.
Ready for Tati Baby or Tati Babay!!!
Lady you look amazing! Keep yourself safe and happy! You DESERVE it! We love you and your Handsome Hubby!!!
Hmmm... misleading video title. Also, you don't want people to buy it because it's stolen but you bought it yourself knowing it was stolen.
Having product that couldn't be properly launched to suddenly seeing it being illegally sold on internet....wow Glad you keep it strong a decide to take care of yourself tati. Good luck in all your future endeavours
Tati, please please tell us that you’re going to rerelease Volume 1. I have wanted it since I turned 50. I’m now 56 and I am afraid I’ll die before I’m able to get my hands on a legit affordable non expired palette. 🇺🇦🙏🇺🇦
Okay 👌 Tati that was a STUNNING pallet, and the vision was beautiful I’m so so sorry that was robbed from you. Sending love.
+GlamLifeGuru  🤨 *Prototype stocks got onto the market when they should have been destroyed?  Evidence of an inside job?*
you look healthier than ever and i hope you are better even tho every one have ups and downs ofcourse, but overal better 🌿❤️
I still wish I had a chance to get volume 1. It makes me so sad!
I still use my volume 1 palette, I still love love love it and this is so bumming me out. I was so excited for your brand and was there for every part of it. I still use the blendiful literally every day and I'm taking really good care of it cuz I can't buy it again and it's a staple in my routine, daily. So sad about everything with this right now.
I remember I had a countdown set for all of your launches. I was obsessed with Blendiful and I was also obsessed with the palette. I still wear it everyday 🥺 hopefully you’re able to create Tati Beauty 2.0. I’ll always support you! 💜
You are a beautiful human, woman. You are so strong and probably a harder worker than most. I love love love you
Tati girl… Why did you make this video?
I really hope you can reopen Tati beauty in some form some day. I can’t wait to see more makeup from you. You’ll get back up again. ❤️❤️❤️
Oh Tati I cannot wait for you to release your products again and when you do, please bring it to the UK.  Looking like the queen that you are.  Healing just agrees with you, you are glowing :)
Never bought the first palette as the color story didn’t speak to me. Did get the beauty blenders. Still using and living.  I was waiting for the second palette hoping it would be cool neutrals or a color palette that fit in with my preferences. Seeing the hijacked palette, you really hit it for me! No, I won’t buy it and support thieves, that would be wrong on many levels. But it must break your heart to see that dream shattered. Believe me, my husband I have been screwed over on two different business deals with “friends.” Not pleasant. It’s totally destroying our retirement. I’m happy to see you and James starting a new chapter in a new place. You’re still young and have years ahead to bring your dreams to reality. I’ll be watching from your fan section.
Sweet Tati!!  Thank you for your care and transparency.  I purchased several of your 1st pallet for myself and close friends as gifts.  We all loved them.  I'm so sorry Tati Beauty was forced to close.  A very good friend of mine gave me some advice that gave me so much peace when I was going thru a business litigation.  Maybe it will do the same for you.  "God knows everything that happened with all the people involved.  You must rest that He is in control and will protect you."  Tati I believe God has better things ahead for you and James.  Enjoy Texas and your new life.  Keep going you're doing GREAT!!! 😊
I can see some patmcgrath favorite shade inspiration here , pretty cool
I hope you'll bring back Tati Beauty in the future, you have so much potential Tati. Sending you love ❤️
Tati one is my one and only palette after my bathroomcleanup 🥰🥰🥰
My forever regret would be not getting my hands on tatis eyeshadow palette 😭😭😭😭
😭😭😭😭 It’s so beautiful, I’m so pissed at that man who ruined your dream, there’s a special place in hell for some people
Tatiiiiii I hope one day you can make makeup again ugh 😣
I really hope Tati Beauty makes a triumphant return at some point, it’s too good not to!
Please bring it back I’m so sad😭😭😭we need Tati beauty back I still use my volume 1 and im obsessed
I’m so sorry this happened to you. But you have a beautiful future ahead and that’s the important thing. 🥰🥰🥰🥰 keep doing what you love.
This should have been much shorter.  Enough, move on.  Glad you like Texas.
It must be so aggravating to see other people profiting from your work when you had to close your brand 😢💔
It was not meant to be !! I’m glad you are back and have a desire to build something and mainly being with us and being chill 🙌We adore you Tati and just love your back and feeling at ease and we can start fresh like your doing 🙏🏼The palette looked fun! But that’s past let carry on 💪🏽
Tati!!! You're a warrior!!!! Sorry this happened!!!! I adore you for the woman that you are ✨
I WOULD'VE BEEN HEAD OVER HEELS FOR THIS! It's so sad to know that we will never get this because i feel like this would've been a huge moment had it come out in 2020. It has such a Tati vibe to it! ❤️
Hi Tati, I have been watching you for years and your such a joy to watch. I live in Dallas , so I am thrilled you moved here. I wanted to invite you to my boutique on Lovers Lane. It’s called Allure Intimate Apparel , please look us up. We are a professional bra fitting store and we would love for you to visit. Thank you for all your wonderful videos and your kind and positive spirit that flows through.  Nicki
People will do anything for money!!! SMH
i would have bought that palette instantly😔😮‍💨
Don't let this squash you.  You are doing so well!!!
Absolutely gorgeous palette!! I really hope you can eventually release an approved version.
It makes me sad that there are probably a lot of people out there who don’t care how hurtful this is to Tati and will still attempt to support theft and buy these palettes. So wrong and if you don’t see it, then ya wasn’t raised right lol.
This whole video pisses me off, because I saw your vision, and purchased your first palette (now I can’t use it because I can’t replace it- now it’s a collector’s item) the pallet was amazing! Halo Beauty is amazing… you research and spend so much time ensuring quality, and the whole project gets ripped from under your feet!  I hope “legal” reads this… the whole product is fucked up for you and the consumer.  I’m pissed that I could not build my collection! I’m even MORE PISSED you were not able launch your vision. Which I was prepared to pay for!   After following you for years and watching your amazing and fun videos each week night; to losing your brand and watching your vids a few nights a week as  result of this BOGUS LAWSUIT!!! As a consumer…. I’m pissed!
LESS OPENING EXPLANATION,MORE INTO DETAILS OF WHAT YOURE SELLING. YOUR VIDEOS ARE DYING BECAUSE OF THIS LONG INTRO ABOUT WHAT HAPPEN IN THE PAST,ETC... STILL LOVE U THO...
This palette is stunning, Tati 😍  I love the variety of colours and textures 🎨  I know the quality will be top-notch, because you wouldn't have it any other way.   I will be looking out for this one. Cheers 🙂
That is so terrible that someone took advantage of this and stole your products. It’s so great that you did this and shared your story!
Absolutely love Textured Neutrals Volume 1. If you had officially  released this palette I'd definitely would have bought it. Hopefully in time we will see Tati Beauty make a comeback.
I bought and still use the first palette on a daily basis.  The black is amazing eye liner and that is what I wear myself.  This palette has it all for me eye wise . I wish that second palette was released.  I won’t purchase if I come across any . It’s so wrong and such a personal violation.  I’m sorry that happened 💜
Oh gosh, saddened to hear this. Tati I wish you could dive into home decor because I believe your talent surpasses make up. I think your while take on colors that go together would be everything in home decor! Girl try it!!!! I will follow you!
I’m so glad I had bought a back up Volume 1 palette when it launched. It’s still in its original packaging and I don’t plan on touching it until I absolutely have to
Damn it I want a blendiful  so bad
Vol 1 is hands down the best palette i own & ever used! Im not a mua but somehow create the best looks and get the most compliments when i use that palette so i would have most defo purchased vol 2 and the enchanted palette.
Don't worry about it tati we love anything with your name we will support bc we trust u truly ❤️
Such a beautiful palette. I would have definitely bought it. But not going to buy this one.  One day, we will get a new brand from you and then we all can experience the passion that you have.  Loads of love. And soo happy for this new chapter of ypur life.
im pretty disappointed this didnt come to. but fully understand why it didnt 😢. It was really pretty.
I really hope you come up with more makeup. I feel so happy that I own the first palette.
we will always support you 100%. you are so real and honest and humble as always. please stay that way always. its so cruel out there but we have to keep faith at our side it will guide us the right path. i wish you much luck!. love u tati!!
Mannnn, people really suck.
Video idea! Your hair routine and also how you sleep with your hair at night. Your hair is so gorgeous, I need to know 💜
Hopefully in the future you can create what you have imagined and I can tell you that the book PR thing would be perfect for those who loves books and makeup so it’s not that far off in fact either are the palettes looking like books
Hearing you talk about this line literally crushes my heart because I would have loved it. Like would have owned every product loved it. Maybe someday
This is so super f#$%ed up. I can't even imagine. Wow.
Please build another makeup brand. Your terms. Your dreams. We will support it. You are the best of the best and it just seems to fit you so well(passion). You will succeed at anything as you’ve proven through hard work. Hopefully we can see your name in a store one day and you can always do a collection based on this in the future of a throwback seeing how MANY people are wanting this palette!
Hi! I am from India and I just got my hands on the Vol 1 Palette last year during August, see, I wanted to gift myself that  for my birthday last year and as a makeup enthusiast as well as a budding influencer, I must say, you ROCKED IT! I have tried several eyeshadow palettes, however, yours is the one that will always be my #1. I hope you come out with your brand again. Much love from India! 😘🙃
This Texas sun has done you will! You’re glowing! 😍✨
Tati, So sorry to hear this news. I know this is terrible thing, but I do think this goes to show how much your product line was loved. I understand your frustrations and hope you can find some peace.💖
There just has to be a way Tati can create and sell more makeup using another name or brand or something! This can’t just be the end!
I’m still rooting for you miss Tati! I’m so glad you’re back doing what you enjoy.
You were robbed!
If you want to get something similar you can buy Mel Thompson's Tiny Marvels palette. You would be supporting her family. May she RIP. I miss her so much
If you had launched that I totally would have bought it. I really hope you will make more eyeshadow palettes in the future.
A second pallette would have been a DREAM. I wear volume I almost everyday and have hit pan on most of the shades.
Kinda sad I never got to try any of your brand, especially the palette :/
Get To The Point…. still too dramatic
I used my Tati palette on my 30th birthday and thank god I did because I walked into a surprise party! I really wanted to dress up that night like a woman in her 20s not 30s. If I’m being honest I dress like I’m in my 70s most of the time. But that night I caked that pink glitter on :)
Oh my goodness....she just kept dragging it out....I zoned out for a bit....lol
Can you get matched for Seint makeup and do a video about it?! Would love your take on this company and their sworn by cream makeup products!
I'm not over it. Still very much have a butterfly spirit 🦋
interestinggg, that is really wild.
Nope
So sorry this was stolen.
Just get to it….
That's right love! It's not over until it's over! You got this.
I don't really understand why you still sell Halo, but not your cosmetic line.  I wish it were the other way around.
❤️❤️❤️ take care...
Anyone who would face this situation would react the same way that you are doing. It’s just human so don’t be to hard on yourself.
Will you ever create a makeup brand again?    Are you still doing the vitamins?   I’m so confused.   Love you bunches Tati! ♥️♥️♥️♥️
I got bored with makeup and tutorials to be honest BUT Tati palette is only one I use now 🙂
I'm not saying anything that anyone else here already hasn't BUT PLEASE BRING BACK TATI BEAUTY!!! The first palette was to say the very least INCREDIBLE....A complete game changer in my makeup routine...I have hit pan on a few and I am heartbroken 💔 I truly hope there's another eyeshadow launch by Tati in the not too distant future
We need to see tati beauty (Tati's version)
Please don’t ever give up. We are here to support you! Excited to see what’s to come.
I’ve always love Tati, but the new Texas Tati is a huge difference in such a good way!! I’m so proud of you💜
Oh my God get to the point!!!
Forever & always my queen!
Twitter! Use my blendiful and even my baby one on the daily and have like 7 backups that are brand spanking new!!!
I am so sorry this happened to you. You have been so much. I believe the future for you  and yours is going to be incredible. Just you wait❤️❤️…
What comes around goes around  Tati!! Can't wait to see what you come out with next!! It will be even better than ever as now you are not learning what to do, you know what to do!! And you do it well!! Those people who hurt you are greedy losers!!!!! Thanks for being you!! 💜💛
❤️ I miss Texas but my Mom still needs me. ❤️
What brands or ppl are doing this to you so we can go say our peace bout it on twitter!
I have the first pallet and was so heart broken when you announced you weren't doing another pallet
🙌🏼 for whats to come! BIGGER & BETTER ❤
I LOVE YOU ALWAYS TATI
Please i need to buy thisssd
I’m curious. So did she make a lot of batches and threw them out...and then they got stolen? If that’s the case, why did she create so many if they weren’t completely done (perfected)?   I might have missed the explanation or simply misheard.
Can you please do Tati Beauty 2, reboot, something?! Ya girl would LOOOVE to see all 30 of your collections!! I know they would be perfection!!
Theu may expose it now Babe.But Rich Lux is one that is just completely jokes amd sattire.He has nothing at all against no one.thays why he dresses as a clown to let ppl know he is not an evil drama channel.He is not one that tries to talk people down he tries to push them up.At the end of the day,he has the best heart ever.
Thanks for sharing!!
Your humor and grace are inspiring. When those "turn and run feelings kick in, fake the humor and grace, if you must, and they will become real in your heart and mind, and drown out those bad feelings.
I’m sorry it never came to market because it’s a beautiful color story. I love your palette and use it judiciously because I want to keep it as long as possible. I think you can never know what the future will bring, and my hope is that whatever is next is a new dream come true.
I'm still devastated that tati beauty has shut its doors
I'm truly sorry about these people out there that are causing these issues. That Pallet is absolutely Beautiful. I never got the chance to purchase Volume 1 but I saw so many YouTubers trying it out and everyone said it was amazing to use. Color Story and the way it applied people left and right were raving about it. Again I'm so sorry that you had to shut down Tati Beauty because of all the circumstances that preceded your Company. Keep that inner Peace going girl. We all love you very much. ❤❤

I so hope you come back with your amazing talent of creating. I was so looking forward to your next releases & really hope I can have that again with your brand Tati!!  You are an amazing person & I love you & your content so much!!!🥰
Can Tati beauty come back
Yasssssssss!!!!!
My Tati palette is still my go to eyeshadow palette when doing any makeup look that I want to be full proof! If we’re being honest, I pick my Tati palette over my 3 Natasha Denona ones. I hit pan on 2 shadows and it makes me sad that I won’t be able to repurchase them 💔 have yet to find a formula similar to yours.
So why you made so many of these palettes if they were never meant to be released?
Sorry this happened, but I HOPE that you come back and create some more palettes! I LOVE the first one you created and I save it for special occasions lol I don’t want to use it because I love it so much! 🤣
Love you Tati,but I  wish you would get to the point faster.
If you do create a new company, please consider coming out with a small 5 pan pallette.  Looking forward to the future of Tati beauty!
I NEED a video on this makeup look!! Gorgeous!
I am SO PISSED cuz I was waiting for the next pallette and was hoping it was going to have some amazing GREENS! 🌲🌈 this is a really beautiful color story (even though I understand it isn't exactly what she wanted) but DAMN it is pretty lame we can't get an approved,  sick version from her 😞  Sorry, quick side note. Her glitter shadow is one-of-a-kind, so beautiful and did not require an adhesive of any type to wear (and they had STAYING power). I just had to give that compliment to Tati (not that she'll ever see this) but WOW. The glitter was some of the best, quality formula on the market and it's a shame they're no longer made. 💚🌦
The collector in me *immediately searching the depths of the internet for this pallet*  The tati lover in me *hugs volume one close to heart & whispers I love you*
Love you Tati 😍
Tati!  That palette is beautiful! I have the first one and I’m so bummed that you aren’t doing Tati beauty anymore!
It looks like the color story was lovely.  It’s a shame people stole from you this way.
Where these all test units? I’m very confused on what was stolen.
Can I request an all glitter pallet. Tati beauty had the best pressed glitter formula.
Oh goodness Tati 😥 I know you didn't intend to entice the purchase but honestly just seeing the palette, I'm already enticed to wanna buy it 😍 I'll try to resist. Oh goodness 😅
I hope and pray one day you will create makeup again. Because you have massive talent. Textured Neutral’s is my all time favorite palette  and I have MANY eyeshadow palette’s. I love the color story with this un-launched palette. I’m sorry you had to deal with this. It’s so nice to see you happy and free and excited again! 🦋
Beauty thy name is Enchanted Textures
Just so sad that stolen products are out there with your name stressing you out. Honestly, I’m glad you’ve started a new chapter in a new place for you and your family.  Take things day by day (as it appears you are working on doing) love that I get to see you now occasionally. You look amazingly happier.
oh lord... i think the beauty industry is nothing but stupid palettes.. god lord.. next
Hi Tati, your original palette was everything. I used it for my ring ceremony and wedding day. Such a special palette. I’m so blessed to have it. I am happy to see you happy!
❤️ love your vision and enjoyment of the process of creating.
maybe it takes a lot of work to use but the 1st palette isnt my fav, the glitter is amazing but i only use like 2 of them , the other colors arent that pretty on my skin tone or dont show like i wanted.   idk why this was needed esp since u dont feel like its gonna actually come out one day but i do feel bad that it happened to you.  also why did u buy it and support criminals?
I am so mad. I would have LOVED AND ADORED this palette. Purples are my FAVORITE.
I’m so sorry that someone has done this! I can’t imagine how violated you must feel. I’ve seen past videos of people reviewing your first palette and it makes me so sad I didn’t get my hands on it, it looked beautiful. 😭 keep being you! You definitely have so many who stand behind you! 💕
I had ordered vol 1 but did not receive and after that tatibeauty closed. I still want vol 1... Please help me how to... My package was lost I think the foreign post in India took it... So please help me any site that can help me receive the pallette
If only it came out. Hands down would have bought it. The blue and the purples were so pretty
You click baited us! 😩
We love you, Tati💜
Ugh she looks so good
I just used the Tati vol 1 this weekend for my daughters dance comp.
Your hair! 😍😍😍
I never got your volume one and i have been in a major state of depression   You are too cute. Ha ha Im so sorry that even happened to you. I feel so bad and still do !!   Why can’t you release this or your first one again ??
Legal hit and ya shut it down using the pandemic. Ya said you did it all alone 😔 you had investors call as I see. If it's all you, if you have financial backing, fair enough! If not be prepared
I’m very sorry you have been going through all this. I love the products I previously bought from you and will look forward to your endeavors in the future.
God will give us the desires of our hearts we just have to claim it! He takes care of his children! Stay strong girl! ♥️♥️
Did you get a nose job?
We ❤️ you Tati!
I’m sad to say I was so bored by this video. First of all, she’s gone from daily videos to two. Now just once a week and it’s an 18 min video about something she wasn’t able to put on market. Plus, it takes her 11:24 minutes before she allows her audience to even see what she’s talking about. No bueno for me 👎🏻
Had to like the video after hearing "baby drama" 😂😂
Volume 1 not a staple but like it - and that version also looked like not a staple but liked it
I have your palette and is my favorite!!! Please , I need your makeup in my life🥰
This was a sad video to watch, I really hope you come out with more makeup one day. You are truly so talented and know your way with makeup like no other. Wish you the best Tati! 💜💜💜💜💜
Seriously I don't think that people care that much. Let it go.
You better not be lying! 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳 I missed out on the first collections and this news is making my week! Yessss!
Bring Tati beauty BACKKKKKK!!!
I'm hoping you do another makeup brand in the future.
We love you Tati!
You ooo like you got face work done here
Love you, Tati, and it is beautiful to see you with peace again. There is something about healing in Texas…never thought I would be here, but the Lord brought us here 4 years ago and it has been such a blessing and miracle. I am not sure if our journey will keep us here, but there was a purpose and it wasn’t what I thought it was for (the job), but ended up being a so much more important. I love seeing that light in your eyes again. Blessings! 🥰🥰🥰
I’m so sorry this happened to you, you deserve nothing but peace, love and happiness!!  Unfortunately I missed your first palette, it looks amazing! ❤️
What a beautiful vision!! I hope You can bring it back, and complete the pallets !! I have the first one, and it is my All time favorite !! What am I going to do when I need another one ?!?! Luv Ya, Tati !!
Your palette will forever be the one that got away 😥
but where's James? Can he please start doing hauls with you, they were my absolute favourite ❤️ 💕
PLEASE! bring tati beauty back😭😭😭😭😭 literally my favorite💔
That palette would have definitely been more my jam. I didn’t get the first one because I don’t use than many neutrals. Bummer, but hopefully you’ll get another chance soon. 😊
Is this palette going to have talc in it as well. Super skeptical using products with talc.
I'm so sad that Tati Beauty didn't work. I so really wanted the first palette but never got around to it.
This really breaks my heart 🥺💔 I would’ve looooved that palette 😭 the first palette I still love & have. It’s my go to!
I am beyond heart broken that Tati Beauty is no more. And even more sadden by whoever has her in court over her brand. We love you Tati and we support you
PLEASE continue 🙏🏼 I need your makeup in my life
We love u tati!!
I need Tati Beauty back as sis was in rough times when the OG palette released 🥺😭 I have so many palettes but there's def an empty spot in my heart wanting it to come back to fill it 😭😭
I love Tati so much and always will. I
I'm confused. If it wasn't approved and not ready why were so many made. Enough to be stolen off a truck and sold?
I always say “I am putting on the one that really loves me”. Love my make up. Going to be 88  years old and still be wearing my make up.  You are awesome!!!  God bless you🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼❤️❤️
Can someone in the beauty industry PLEASE invest in Tati and a Tati Beauty reboot?
Ugh it’s bitter sweet watching this just overall 🥺 Your Vol. 1 palette honestly is the perfect eye shadow palette till this day I have yet to find better 😍❤️ You’re second launch would have been unreal 🥹 regardless better things are to come 💯 no matter what you are going through you always are a positive light on here I hope you know how much we adore you and are wishing you the best always ❤️💯
I was ready to buy all the volumes.  My own eyeshadow encyclopedia.
I think everyone here appreciates your honesty and thanks for sharing. The colours in that palette are gorgeous.💚💚
I hope one day you can come out with makeup again because you’re so creative with your ideas Tati ☺️
I still don’t understand why you can’t just re-brand? Change the name of your pallets and start over? Did you sell your soul to this person that you were in partnership with? I feel like so much of it doesn’t make much sense. Create a new formula, use all of your contacts in the beauty world, and call it beauty by TATI instead of TATI beauty lol
Your hair is looking beautiful!
The Textured Neutrals volume 1 was easily my favorite every day go-to palette. It's super disappointing that this will never reach our hands as your loyal followers. Thank you for sharing.....but it still stings knowing that you had something so beautiful in the works and it was taken away from all of us. I hope in the future you can do your own brand without the drama and bs and just do what you are so amazingly great at♡♡
Can you do a hair care routine for us? We know it wouldn’t just be sponsored crap like other ones but what you actually use and how you use it. Your hair is always so shiny and lovely.
You went through so much unfairness, I can totally relate :( a hug for you! 💖
I love you and I want your damn colection… well I’m in Texas .. bastrop.. where can I get one? 🤣
My hopes for a Tati Beauty pallet are in the depths of sadness now! Love you Tati!
Please rebrand when you are legally able to. Your vision is so worthwhile.
Tati, you were the only innovative makeup creator amongst the many thousands, your formula and texture palette was brilliant and not mundane or orthodox like other brands especially high end! As you begin a new chapter, keep creating, keep being innovative! Put Jesus first and He’s going to bless you so much, your latter days will be greater than your past!
You look so beautiful!! I respect the peace you maintain🔥
I’m sad I didn’t buy a blendifull, hopefully this will come back someday
This video, this new you... Loving the evolution of Tati and cannot wait to see where your journey will take you!
Tati - That palette is just so beautiful. I genuinely hope that you create a new company in the future and continue to develop cosmetics. I'll be a buyer!
I’m so sorry this happened Tati. Also, your makeup look is just stunning!
Makes me soo sad! Literally im soo love with your 1st palette! I really really hope you come back with another cosmetic line! I have saved one of the 2 palettes I bought specifically for my wedding!
Can we all shed a little tear for that cool neutral palate that she mentioned......🙃😥
I thought she was closing Tati beauty? I’m confused but excited anyway
So, just in the sidelines, but Tati looks literally the best she’s looked in a long time. Like I feel like I’m seeing circa 2019 Tati living her best life.
Welcome to Texas Tati! Beauty, brains, and another strong woman in my state!
Omg. You are looking so stunning!!!! Love u💕💕💕💕🎉🎉🎉🎉🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Never was able to get the palette and I'm so sad about it. I did get the blendiful
So sad! We didn’t get a chance to see the final result…but love the color story and I can’t wait for what your cooking 🧑‍🍳. Thank you Tati 🥰🥰
Super sad i never was able to get that first palette 😫 I totally hope ur able to relaunch the beauty line. Been enjoying the daily vitamins I finally nabbed for Christmas present to me
Does anyone know how her litigation situation is going? Is it over yet?
The Tati palette literally last on me from 7pm-5am without creasing. Love it so much
I always thought what would Volume 2 palette look like and it's sad to see it this way
Mannnn I hope she finds her way back into Tati beauty. I definitely want the what ifs in my collection...lol
I'm so sorry this happened, but your transparency speaks volumes! I am also a perfectionist, so I can sympathize with the idea your name is out there and people might not know the truth. But I admire you for working through the bad times in life, taking care of yourself, and being as happy as you  can be with how life goes. You look so much happier and healthier than the last time I tuned in and I need to start watching your makeup content again! There aren't a lot of makeup only channels anymore and I love how much you truly talk about makeup! It's my first love of YouTube content 💜  Hope I see more makeup from you someday! I love your products 💜
This is so sad!!! I love my Tati palette and would be even more psyched to have a cool tones version. Please don't stop....if anyone can bring us quality products it's YOU Tati!!! Also can I just say that I think to myself frequently I wish Tati would pull out her palette and show us some more looks using it. Thanks girl!
14 minutes! It takes 14 minutes to see the palette.
I was able to get your first pallette and I have to say, it is truly amazing. If and when you drop more shadows, I'm down.
Saw one at Poshmark months ago- and thought that this is exactly what you are describing. As curious as I was, don’t agree with supporting such scratchy stuff- there are many other brands I would spend my money on. I do feel bad for you- one can see that this meant a lot to you.
You have such an eye for colors and your vision creates such a story! I sincerely hope you’re able to sell makeup products and fulfill your dreams again one day! 💜 I think this palette, whenever you finished and got it where you wanted it to be, would have been so beautiful!! I love the original palette, and let me tell you a Textured Neutrals cool toned palette 😍😍 that would be everything!  On another note, you look so stunning in this video and I would love a tutorial ✨
I really hope, you can launch your own makeup line again. Your palette is so beautiful.
🥰👏🌈🌺🌺🌺
Love your hair!!! I still love my eyeshadow palette from you. 💖 Thankfully there’s always a hope and a future and I know anything you do will be amazing!  Would you possibly do suggestions on wedding makeup? Like great eyeshadow palettes or blushes or anything for bridal makeup? Not even like to spoil your sisters makeup, but just for any bride
I would love if you would find dupes for Tati beauty textured neutrals or similar colors 😍
So sorry this happened Tati, it looks gorgeous, hopefully whoever did this to Tati Beauty gets caught. xx
Sad this happened, but desperately hoping Tati Beauty can be resurrected, it’s the best palette I’ve ever used
still sad i never got a pallet
I need you to continue to do makeup. You made my favorite eyeshadow palette. Best formula ever.
No f…. Way 😭 I am so excited ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Girl, get to the point
I love you Tati. Your videos make my day. I still have and always will have the volume 1 pallet and the blendiful!!! Love it!!!
I am so sad this never made it!!! We still love you Tati!!!😘
Dang girl... you look like a million bucks $$
💐 You go Tati! We love you no matter what! ❤️💕❤️💕
Hugz U LovesU
Please make more makeup and skincare don’r give up!
I'm more interested in knowing why it wasn't approved... Why, other than ingredients would it fail?? And if the palettes online were "stolen" then it was as close to the final product as possible I would think. I'm curious to know the quality of the ones online because a good palette is a good palette regardless of who it is or isn't made by. I'm here for the makeup, not the people behind it.
I know this video is very bittersweet, but I actually love listening to you talk about what your plans were. I'd love to know all 30 plans you had. It's very interesting and inspiring.
You look gorgeous, Tati! Beautiful inside and out. What a heartbreaking ordeal~ But now that you've said your truth, you can move on and upwards^^ I hope you have a great week enjoying Texas with hubby~~
I still have my Tati Beauty Volume 1 palette and I rarely use it because I know I won’t be able to get it again. It’s such a bummer that there will be no more. I keep hoping that maybe Halo Beauty will launch external skin care and makeup in the future. I absolutely am in love with my HSN vitamins. They have totally changed my life. Much love Tati!!!
🤮
Girl…You are living in Big Girl country. Welcome to TEXAS.  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
🌹Good Video as Usual🌹 🤩Lovely thumbnail tho🤩  Beyond Beautifully you Are  Ur Makeup always on Point  Those BreAthtaking eyes love Em  😚Nice Ass Cheeks Structure😚 EnJoy your night  Happy Fantastic Week Too  STAY BLESS N BE SAFE ALWAYS😇
You obviously have so much creativity and more to put out in the world, and I look forward to whatever that may be.
Wow, so sorry all this is happening.  The palette looks like it would have been beautiful.
I think you should reopen and re-launch this it’s yours and it’s beautiful I need it
Is it me or all the new shadows are looking like easter eggs!  Natasha Denona's palette is a joke!  Tati, let this one go. You are almost an easter egg too.
Glad you are doing so well! Can feel your positive vibes! All the best!
if the product wasn’t approved, why were so many of them made? doesn’t a product have to be a approved before making enough of them to fill a trucks worth?
Man that color story, gosh I wish this would have worked out differently 😔
WE LOVE YOU PLEASE KEEP CREATING I CANT WAIT FOR YOUR NEXT PALLET
Life takes us in so many directions. We live and we learn. Something good always can come out of something bad. Maybe not the dream we started, but maybe something we never knew was even a possibility. Back in my day the saying was, "just keep trekking". It does seem strange to be so darn sad about an eyeshadow palette, but I am!
I hope you do come out with another eye shadow palette. I am still using your first eye shadow palette and LOVE IT!!!! ❤❤❤
I never got the chance to get the first palette but hopefully 🙏 this time I do.🥰
Tati! You look so amazing! Not that you didn’t before but girl… you are glowing ❤️
blendiful is still the only thing I use to blend out my concealer and contour
Harlem  by Langston Hughes  What happens to a dream deferred?  Does it dry up  like a raisin in the sun? Or fester like a sore - And then run? Does it stink like rotten meat? Or crust and sugar over - like a syrupy sweet?  Maybe it sags like a heavy load.  Or does it explode?  Thank you for sharing with us. I am sorry this happen. Stay strong.
Bought your Volume 1 pallete from your website a week before you guys shut down.. I was so happy I finally had decided to buy it.. Still love it but since I know i won't be able to repurchase anytime soon I use it for special occasions. Still hoping for tati beauty to come back 💕
I'm so sorry this happened to you!
Stay strong young lady.  God has you in his hands.
Purple shadows created by Tati would have been so good! I would love to be given some Tati approved alternatives.
Wow . That’s all I can say. This probably was something really hard to make a video about , and relive the past.
This really stinks 😕 people really suck sometimes.  Best of luck
❤️
How come you don’t wear your wedding ring anymore? :(
I hate that I never got to own Textured Neutrals 😭 and any other palettes that could have been.
Thank you for your honesty and positive attitude, even in a stinky situation! I still hold out hope for more color palettes someday from you, because your Textured Neutrals Vol 1 has literally been my ride or die palette since I got it. Seriously,  I don't use any of my other ones because yours is so gorgeous, so versatile, and so easy to work with.  I can't imagine how hard it has been for you to watch your dreams and plans slip away, but I am confident that you will find new ways to flourish. 😊
Honestly so sad Tati beauty had to cease, but everything happens for a reasons
Just waiting for that comeback because Volume 1 WAS SO GOOD 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 love you Tati 💖
How awful I hope you restart your brand your inspirational
I’m so sorry this has happened to you 💔
I'm proud of where you are. The future can bring many things and I look forward to the next chapter.

I bought Tati vol 1 and I have it. I consider it a keepsake and if I don’t use it up, I own that. I’ll keep it in my airtight storage forever. I would not buy something that you didn’t launch and in fact wasn’t aware of this “product” but thanks for educating us.
Why didn’t you sell the rest of volume 1!? I had 7 pallets in my cart when the site shut down WITHOUT WARNING!!! Please just make another palette 😭😭😭😭😭
It’s the sequins for me. Favorite formula concept ever. I keep hoping you’ll be able to bring those out as singles/refills. Looking forward to the future for you!
Hey Tati, can you talk about the litigation or is it still going on?  You were born to create makeup, when can you open a new business?  You look stunning as always!!!
Omg !!! 12:00!in still NO SHADOWS
You look so good Tati omg 😱
You look stunning!!
Tati, thank you for coming here and being open and honest about this situation. I’m sorry this is happening to you and I wish nothing but the best for you. It looks like it would have been a beautiful palette and i love your creative mind. You are my favorite person to watch and i can’t wait to follow you for the rest of your career and life ♥️
I am so sorry that you are having to deal with even more bs. I can't wait to see what you come up with next.
Yes yes yes Tati!!  Atta girl!!
IMO, (I’m sure amongst other things), the move has done U well. Ur soul is glowing at its brightest again!🥰 I appreciate that U got yourself together beforehand. A professional business woman indeed.💪❤️👍 Also, that’s crappy.🤯The lengths thieving ppl go for a quick buck is pitiful. This is something that could understandably cause an emotional meltdown. If nothing else, may karma bite them in their money makers.😅😎
That was boring. Too much preamble. LET IT GO, LET IT GO!!
RIP hereforthetea 🥹
I wish ur old palette was still around, at the time i didn’t have the money to buy it, but it was one of the first palettes i fell in love with when i first started makeup
Why were so many pallets made if it wasn’t ready for sale? Was it to send to people to try 1st? Like a rest market thing
I was hoping this was a new launch update!
OMG if you would have been able to launch that palette I would have ordered it right away. I LOVE your 1st palette
Your strength and growth is so inspiring! And you look as beautiful as EVER!
Can’t wait to see what’s next for you!  Your products are all too notch!  BIG fan!
You look fabulous and are an inspiration. The move really seems to suit you! I didn’t get the first pallet and am excited for whatever Tati pallet comes out next. In the meantime, how cool is it that something you thought up and had not even finished was so steal-worthy? That’s the type of thing that happens to a truly talented artist! 💕
Finally shows the pallet at minute 14:09 🙄
I’m still so sad that we don’t have Tati Beauty and these amazing concepts to look forward too. It’s just awful someone would steal all your hard work and release something like this. :(
It was yours and now its tainted yuck. Welp you can always start something using another name just let me know what's what and I'm on it.
Honestly I'm just so sad Tati Beauty has ended. I never buy influencer brands but once I saw your first pallette and the blendiful I had to get it. I feel like I'm grieving a loss. I'm so happy you are in a good place Tati. can't wait for the future
My Tati Beauty Neutrals Vol 1 is seriously my all time favorite palette. What I wouldn't give to have a new one. When you start to create again, I hope it's makeup but regardless I will be right there to support you.
I look forward to whatever you create next. I too am pleased that people supported you on YouTube. I will pray for God to bring to justice those who stole your work for their profit. It sounds like He's already at work.
Love you so much Tati. You have a Godly survivor’s heart. You lift up us all.
if that pallette WAS ever a thing, i would have worn the absolute shit out of that purple row <3 so cool
I'm so sad that we missed getting to have this palette. The first one is very special to me and...my, oh my...this Enchanted would have been too. We've all been robbed 💔 Once again, I'm incredibly sorry you & your family has had to be dealing with this.
I would have been all over that collection.
Girl, I’d buy that in a heartbeat Wth with you not liking it now. I’ll take the one you have if you don’t want it 😊
I would have loved to have that palette in my collection
Hello. Wow Tati this is never ending. I am sorry this happened to you. Keep pushing forward Tati.
And you’ve DONE. IT. AGAIN....... Gave me the chills! You go girl!!!!!!!! Dont you DARE let this cut throat world keep you down!!!!!!!!!! You BETTER keep shinning like your glitter pans that I soooooooo badly want to get my hands on, BUT until you’ve got YOUR website back up and running, my inpatient self, will be patient!!!!!!!! Let your patiently waiting subscribers, that can’t wait to get  our hands on your products, be your inspiration to keep fighting Tati bc us complete strangers ARE. YOUR. BIGGEST. CHEERLEARDERS!!!!!! We BELIEVE in you!!!!!!! 😘
The vol 1 is my go to pallet and most used. So glad that one made it out first. Perfect for everyday use.
I anticipate the next beauty YouTube trend will be to recreate this pallet with available products.
I feel guilty being nosey about this, but I’m wondering why she’s not wearing her wedding ring…I’m concerned!
I will never get rid of my volume one palette; the sequin shades are unmatched and I can’t find anything like it anywhere else. I get endless compliments when I wear it 😭❤️
Just here to say you look SO pretty!!
Your first palette is my ALL TIME favorite palette. Xo
I literally use volume 1 daily; I’ve hit pan on many shades and it’s a bummer I won’t be able to ever replace it. Hopefully you’ll be able to create more in the future because those shadows are literally amazing ☺️
Your palette is the only palette I still use and I have all sorts of palettes! The light beige, almost a light skin tone color is so beautiful and covers the lid beautifully! It’s always a great addition to my look. I’m almost out of it and I’m so sad that I won’t be able to use it anymore ):
I would have loved neutrals volume 2! Was waiting for the cool toned version, so sad. Hopefully in the future there will be something like that, holding out hope.
I lit didn’t buy the first one just because I couldn’t justify that I already had those colors and was waiting for a colorful palette to buy 😭
Tati beauty vol one was my very first Simi high-end eye shadow palette (non drug store). I love it I still use it almost daily, but I'm hitting pan on my favs!
I am so sad for you!! Breaks my heart that you poured so much passion and soul into these products and that everyone (myself included) would have bought them in a heartbeat! Oh well, onwards and upwards my good friend—I see amazing, creative, innovative, and successful things in your future!!! xxx
Sorry, I'm too mesmerized to focus right now
Excited to hear your not done! You made some of the best products ever!!! I hope you come back with a new line
Create More Makeup Pls!!!!❤️🙏🥰
Love the color story of that palette.. I hope If you do come back in creating again it would be cosmetics & I can't  wait definitely would be buying.😊🙃❤️
This new video quality is INSANE. Like legit insane. You look amazing.
I’m ready to hear your testimony 💕  With all the words and mentions in between.. I cannot wait. The world needs it, Tati ❤️  You never know how many hearts you’ll reach! Btw I enjoy your content so much!
“Commit your works to the LORD, And your thoughts will be established.” ‭‭Proverbs‬ ‭16:3‬   “But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.” ‭‭Matthew‬ ‭6:33‬ ‭  💛🌻
This is heart breaking 💔 ugh
I’m so sad that I didn’t get the chance to purchase your first pallet.
I never got a Tati Palette, I could afford it quite yet, and I asked for Christmas but didn’t get it, then covid happened and then it got shut down. I have been crushed about it ever since.
Love you!
I’m sorry this happened to you,stay strong don’t let anyone bring you down. Especially since you’ve come back from some tuff times. I’m glad your filming again and you look happier ❤️
Prayers that they get this taken care of on the legal front. Hearing that your creativity is coming back strong made my heart happy, because even just watching your videos gives me creative ideas for makeup and even for redecorating my home. I hope you come out with a cosmetic company again in the future. Whatever you do I’m sure it will be wonderful.
Omg 😱 glad you are sharing that with us … I would love to see products from you again regardless God has amazing plans in your life 😘
Growing up, I was taught that when you see butterflies, it means a loved one who has passed is stopping by to say hello!
I dont get why there was so many made if it "wasn't the final"???
God has a way of taking you out of a path that he knows is not right for you.
That is so wild !!! My Tati pallet is still my favorite 💖
That is awful! So excited to see what you do next.
Pretty ballzy that someone thinks they can create and sell something that is not theirs and think it’s ok !! I hope you get to the bottom of it and get compensated for this and can’t wait to purchase whatever it is you do create!! Tati you can’t try to create but we all know your formula and story can never be duplicated!!
I'm not joking when I say I use Volume 1 every day... It is SO VERSATILE. I love the hell out of that palette and HATE that the rest of your work was "stolen" from you.
I am so sorry this happened to you Tati. I would have loved to get it.💜
Don't give up Tati 💛
The grace and poise you are able to embody in the midst of all of these hurdles is astounding. We’re all so proud that you never threw in the towel. You look glowing and confident, and I know whatever you set your sights on next will be as elegant as you are. I still wear my Textured Neutrals Volume One. On VERY special occasions, because those formulas and shades are miraculous, and I’m going to be devastated when they’re gone!
Mental Health will always be first, buuuuuut if Tati were to launch a rebranding maybe like “XOXO -Tati” Im soooooo in. You deserve to shine, you deserve a brand to call your own and we are here to support you.
For the love of god, please make makeup again
Okay, literally hit pause and purchased Halo from her site. It’s my first time trying it and I’m so excited. ♥️ So good to see Tati back and thriving 💕
Love this look! 🥰
No!!!!!!!!! MAKE A NEW BRAND!!! We need a Tati brand!!!!!!!
My Tati palette is and always will be my favorite. It’s my “collectors item” now I use it very sparingly lol You did beautifully with your brand while you had it and I believe whatever you do in the future will be done just the same! ❤️❤️
I’m sad you’ve lost that piece of yourself… fantasy and whimsy are wonderful companions in life💚
If it wasn’t for sale, how did there get to be so many?  We’re they sent to people to try?
I can’t imagine how heartbreaking it must be to watch your ideas and your creations be stolen. It was evident your brand was something you worked so incredibly hard for Tati and I’m so sorry it came to an end like it did. It’s crazy you mention your connection to butterflies as I’m in my own transformation of life right now and have felt that connection to them as well.  I hope your creative fire never dies and that you continue to create and innovative in this world of beauty and make up ♥️
I’m so sorry this happened to you…! 💔💔💔 I couldn’t even imagine how that would feel to have something so personal stolen and sold… not from you & not in your hands. My heart goes out. But I have so much faith of what the future has in store. I appreciate you being open about this incident you didn’t have to share that with us. Though I get you needed to address it now that it’s out there. This too shall pass! 🙏🏼
It's a gorgeous pallet.
I am here for when you make more color cosmetics! I’ll treasure my Textured Neutrals palette forever. Best palette I own! ❤️
That’s just annoying, sorry that this happened
I didn't get the first pallette n I regret it so much. 😭
You can still do a huge comeback launch! Why the F not?! Put it in James’ name and be the “creative director!” You can still create makeup!!!
So glad you’re enjoying being here in Big D.  How did you like those storms last night?  Crazy but exhilarating!  Sorry we never got to see the legit launch.  You put out such thoughtful quality products.  💗you!  Enjoy a margarita!  If you don’t want to go back into makeup at this moment, I would love to see candles or cosmetic storage or decor from you.  You have a wonderful aesthetic and level of taste.
That palette is bomb! I would have for sure bought it if Tati had released it. It’s so crap that this has happened to her. I truly hope that Tati Beauty can come back.
So very sorry you’re dealing with this!! Your first palette is still one of my favorites ♥️
You made me love makeup. Your palette is still my all time favorite!!! Can’t wait to see what you do in the future.
I desperately wanted the original pallet 🥺 so sad it’s no longer available. Wishing you all the very best for future creations Tati xx
Tati, I’m sure I speak for more than just myself when I say, your community here will always show up & support you!!  💜  It’s so cool to see even the general concept of what Tati Beauty was working on too!
Shame on those thieves! You still have class that no amount of cosmetics that can replicate that.
Omg rebrand Tati and release it!
Not going to lie, I started browsing online to see if I could buy it because it looks beautiful. I wish it would have had its moment to launch. I’ll just keep enjoying what’s left of my textured neutrals palette.
are you wearing colored contacts today? Your eye's look ever so slightly different to me lol
I’m sorry but if it wasn’t approved why would you produce soooooo many palettes?
I love my Tati Vol. 1 palette and totally would have purchased enchanted textures!  Hopefully you will come back with some more beauty for us one day!
I don’t know about everyone else but something that I would really love to hear is like what you already had planned for a Tati beauty I really love how you went in depth with this pallet but I really want to know what other ideas you had, see sketches stuff like that
I hope there is a Tati beauty 2.0 in the future ❤️ I never got a chance to own the textured neutrals pallet but I hope to own your next product!!
What a shame that this never came to fruition, it would have been beautiful. Kudos to you for sharing all of this.
The fact that you can sit there and smile through something so horrifying and through all you’ve been through is a true testament of hope and faith, Tati. (Wow! 312 likes! You all are awesome!) 💖
Please Find a way to make these products you are so talented that's this is stunning I didn't get to get your first palate and your formula is what people talk about people they all say it's one of the best out there I really hope you're able to get the makeup back out there's Gotta Be A Way
Please Find a way to make these products you are so talented that's this is stunning I didn't get to get your first palate and your formula is what people talk about people they all say it's one of the best out there I really hope you're able to get the makeup back out there's Gotta Be A Way
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO ANOTHER MAKEUP LINE! I trust your vision and the quality of your products. Anything you do would be so elegant and timeless 💕
Gosh tati your a beautiful person!! I own but barely use (anymore) my tati beauty volume 1 palette because I know I won't be able to buy another one and it's literally my favorite palette! In my opinion the formula and blend ability is one of a kind! outta all the eyeshadow I have tried that is! I truly believe you'll be creating again some time in the future because you are damn good at it and you have a strong passion for it. I would have adored a brown cool tone palette!!! Xoxo
I still use my Vol 1, it is my favorite pallet! I always feel my most beautiful when I wear it. The sequin shades are my go to. Please create more. Much love and support to you!!
Ugh, it breaks my heart that you don’t get to release these items & see that dream become reality. Volume 1 is gorgeous & is the palette where I always got the most compliments. I hope your new dreams come true!
Since your blendiful it seems so many others like it have now come out. Be proud you have paved way for interesting new products.
I’m so heartbroken for so many reasons!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE your first pallet and I know whatever you would’ve done would’ve been great!! So I’m sad we never were able to get this pallet and I’m so mad ppl would take this from you!! I truly pray you make another make up brand! It’s my all time favorite make up ever!! And as a make up collector and lover that says a lot!! Please don’t give up! And make another brand!!!!!
Still have and love Volume 1 of Tati Beauty palette, unfortunately my sister murdered the glitter portion which is upsetting since there is no way to even purchase the palette. Whenever the legal stuff gets taken care of Tati do you think you’d ever come out with another makeup brand or other items besides Halo Beauty? If yes, from all the legal stuff has it taught you on kind of the dos and donts when it comes to owning a brand and stuff that you’d just do differently. Also is it possible for you to even give tips for those who are either starting out or thinking about having their own brands?
Till 8 mins it’s just thank you 🙈🙈🙈 too long
I just had to get rid of my original Tati pallete because it has Talc and I'm so upset it was my staple! I hope to see new products  one day without talc
Wow Tati it looks beautiful! So sorry for all the work you did and have it stolen. I know you will bring us all the goods either way. Your honesty,artistry and passion is why we are all still here . Thank you for sharing. The pictures are outstanding!
Wait? This isn’t something that’s coming? Really?
I still wish I got a first volume of Tati pallets. I hope you have peace w this and you are better than just a pallet.  Btw—how did you do your hair in this video…tutorial please?!?!🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
I'm so proud of you for confronting this head-on. That must have taken a lot of Courage. You handled it with Grace and dignity. I'd like to think I'm in the know with things in the makeup Community, but this is the first I heard of it. I'm really surprised I haven't heard anything about this palette.  It's absolutely beautiful, and you did a really great job on it. You should be very proud of yourself. But it wasn't meant to be, and that's okay. There's bigger and better things coming.❤❤
Tati, I am sorry you have been going through this, it is definitely disturbing and a shame. I am claiming a big, fair resolution for you! I would love to purchase your makeup but only from you. Tati, PLEASE don’t let anything or anyone take your joy!🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 With all being said, your make up on this video is flawless, heck, you are flawless to perfection!!!Can you please recreate this look for us on another video? I would appreciate it greatly! ✌🏽💖🤗🦋😍✊🏽💋🐶✌🏽
I'm so sorry this got stolen from you.  I am glad though that you feel more at peace and good. I missed seeing you happy and at peace. ❤❤❤❤ This palette would have been very nice but no matter what, I am sure whatever you create in the future will be amazing. 💜
I need the original Tati palette back, because I am obsessed with it. I need my glitter back!!!!!!!
It's a beautiful pallet, but I won't buy it. I look forward to your future works. Have you thought about going into home interior design pieces? You have amazing style from what you have shown us. I would definitely purchase home interior items if you designed them.
Sending you love and support!! 💕💕💕 also welcome to Texas 💕💕
Ppl selling it?!
At some time in the future will Tati beauty open back up snd relaunch ??
Vol.1 is my mom's favorite palette, it's a shame we won't see this one.
I am so sorry that Tati Beauty didn't have a chance to work out. I truly hope you get the opportunity to launch a new cosmetic brand, if that's something you are interested in doing again. Your first palette was beautiful, well thought out, and you can truly see the effort that was put into it. I truly think you have a talent for creating makeup. So if you ever started over, I think you would kill it!
Cannot wait to see what the futures holds for you!   This wasn’t the end, just the beginning. Good has other plans for you.
What Jerks!!!!   I use Volume1 all the time, but sparingly cuz I dnt want it be be gone.  💕💕
Please don’t give up! Get back to business when you’re ready! I want your makeup so very badly!
This is sad but I still hope for more to come
The drama channels are distracted  by Amber Heard/ Johnny Depp and Black Chyna/ The Kardashians. You are better than that anyway. You relocated for a new start. Go forward and keep your eyes on the prize, whatever that may be. Tighten your circle, and stick with your family first and foremost. Drama is not worth it, it causes stress you just don't need. I found myself having to do this once. And I have never been better! Much Love Tati!!
❤❤❤
Please find a way to sell this. I would still buy it. I love my first one.
Why can’t you just do Tati beauty again? Still the best palette I’ve ever used. Was hopeful for your brand’s future
it’s so good to see you even more stronger and happier tati 💛
Jesus looks good on you Tati 🥺🥰
do you mind sharing what camera are you recording with? the quality is amazing!!
I bought that palette twice. Use it everyday!
I’m upset I never received your first pallet 😩😢
When I volume was took of the market my heart broke because I never get to have ordered mine as it was always been sold before I get my hands to order. Still wishing to get my hands play with the beauty of vol 1 tho.
I’m SO sad that the brand ended. Volume 1 is one of my favorite palettes of all time!
Omggg this lighting
I’m sorry this happened to you. That color palette is sooo beautiful 😍
Honestly, I'm waiting to buy whatever album you put out of songs you have written and recorded.
Any suggestions for something similar to the Blendiful? I loved it so much and recently had to part with mine
Yessssss more Tati products!
WHAT !?!?!!!!! Ok ok here we go
Definitely heartbroken because I still use my original pallet over any other pallet and it makes me so sad that once I finish it I can't repurchase
Why did she have a truckload of a non-approved product that wasn’t ready to be released though?
I’m so sad I can’t purchase this pallet, it’s stunning. The purples would have been everything. 💜 I’m so sorry Tati!
Wishing you the best. I hope in the future we get more Tati beauty because I love volume 1 and I’ll keep forever and ever.
Well if it's worth anything, it looks like you do colourful makeup really well, the shades look so cohesive and well put together. You should definitely try again with maybe something a little different like pastelles for spring (a colour story I have never seen done wearable) or gem tones for fall. You have a real talent and something crappy like this situation should not stop you. I have seen bigger influencer makeup flops make a complete turn around.
Was gonna nap before my stream but now I want to play with my Tati pallet 😂😂
I never clicked on video so fast... I was hoping it really was the comeback of Tati beauty
Yaaaaas our prayers were answered #TEAMTATI
I’m so sorry this has happened to you!!! This palette color story looks so good and enticing to me!! Hope that in the future you come up with something similar maybe? 🖤✨🖤✨🖤
lots of love and light to you Tati!!!!!
I would love to purchase any makeup item you'll create if you ever do again. 💛 Hoping you are well Tati and hope you have a great week. God bless.💗💗
It is not lost on me that this is very sad that this happened to you!  Seriously, I had no idea that these pallets were out there!  Not that I am a makeup guru but seriously this really sucks! I hope whomever is responsible for this is stopped asap!  What is wrong with people???
We need time stamps
IM SO FLIPPIN EXCITED!
I can't wait to see what you create next!! ❤ I been watching you for years and i just love you!! Watching your videos makes me want to do better in life!!
I have been watching you for YEARS! You are truly the OG in the beauty world. I have your vol. 1 pallet and it stays in my everyday make up kit! I’m absolutely obsessed! So sad this won’t come to market! I hope you have big things for us in the future!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Tati, not sure if you saw, but you're TN1 palette won best palette in Allie Gline's recent video! It did look gorgeous, although I didn't purchase it at the time ($$ was tight at the time)
I hope one day you will get to make more pallets for us to enjoy.   I hope the drama leaves you alone.  It never stops!!!!
look if these people are purchasing stolen goods dont even bother yourself with what they think of it, hopefully they all get pinkeye. \
that's good drama channels aren't coming out with drama content because that's so out of season and toxic. no more drama yay!!
Girrrrrllll!!
Just out of curiosity, if these were not approved, how come there were so many palettes to steal? I am honestly just curious as to why they would even be made if there weren’t approved.
Love the video
I feel like I'm watching Tati on my television...the lightning, the setup, the make-up, the hair, everything is 🔥.   The next tv star!
How come you age more and more beautiful? 😭
My Tati volume 1 is sitting on top of my vanity along with my blendiful and was the only palette I used on my wedding day. It is my absolute favorite and I can not wait for you to create more beautiful products! I also can’t wait to purchase another volume 1! I’m almost hitting pan on a few of my favorites ❤️❤️
Stunning palette. Glad you have come to terms with the issues. Sorry people are greedy and stole your product.
Aww man. That blue row looks absolutely  perfect.  :(  sad that people had to steal and be mean and ruin things.
I hate that this happens to a good person like Tati. We will always support you!
Not getting your palette was one of my BIGGEST makeup regrets. I was hoping at the very end you were going to say you're making them again *sob*  You are too talented not to keep making cosmetics!!
Girl.... my tati volume 1 palette is my favorite. I would absolutely love to see a volume 2 and I would purchase it as well.
I’m so upset that this brand dissolved because I want it all and love all these ideas
Tati .. I always want to like you and watch your videos but your always so long winded and take forever to get to the point .. it feels like nails on a chalk board I'm sorry and I feel bad but woman get to the point!!!
I’m so happy for you, Tati. New home🥳🥳🥰🥰New Chapter. Happy for this new chapter in your life. May God continue to bless you 🤍🤍🤍 can’t wait to see what the future holds
I still have the first pallet you launched and I love it. I hope you come back bigger and better.
I’m sorry about what happened. I hate peoples takes advantage of that but I’m sure you are coming back sooner or later I’m here going to wait.
I am so sad that I didn't order the palette when I had the chance. 😭😭
Also please don't buy up all of your palettes that weren't suppose to be released so we can find one of the treasures lol
Tati, I am sorry I was late to the whole beauty party. I find you authentic, delightful, funny and a solid person. Tati your authenticity shines through, your light can not be dimmed your dreams are yours and only you can give away your power.  Trust you heart, trust your sixth sense, you don’t need anyone to do the most fantastic things! Your light cannot be hidden, connection, eye for beauty and authenticity is your super powers! Wishing you all the strength and preservation needed to do what your heart desires! Nothing is too big, dream big Tati! I am a big fan, thank you for sharing your journey you are brave and strong! Tanya
I would love to see you come back with another beauty brand! You are so right it’s not how many times we fall, it’s how often we get up that matters. You’ve got the right attitude, it’s not over until it’s over.  Best of luck to you Tati!💕
my favorite eyeshadow i wear daily comes from you..i bought 2 of first volume, my best friend stole one palette, couldn't say no to her and now it's her favorite eyeshadow palette..i really want more tati beauty! Strangers and work associates always complements me on my eyes daily! Thank you
I pray you come out with another makeup line!!
I have the 1st. Palette and both Blendeful still packed up like the day it came. Now I can’t even use it it will break my heart ❤️  We love you Tati!! Keep creating…. that’s your calling! 💕💝
Dangggg that would have been my fav palette for sure :( we lost
Tati make more palettes please! Your love for classy and all things glitter aligns with my style completely 🙌🏼✨✨
Whoever stole your palettes, you're a really stupid person! Also, don't buy it since it's stolen property. Instead, report the websites who are selling them to the authorities.
Tati please for moms on the go small palletes bring it back
I will still patiently wait for another palette of yours. Or anything makeup related ❤️❤️
14:06 you're welcome
I saw a few women in FB makeup groups who spent $150+ on Mercari for that palette. Which I thought was a fake, but also the audacity of people who are selling them.
The way you looked at the palette and said the names, it broke my heart, I could see the pain behind that gorgeous smile 🥺💔
I really love Texas Tati.Look how radiant and glowing she is..💕
I'm so sorry this happened!
Thank you Tati 😽🌴🏝
I neeeeeed another blendiful 😭😭😭 or a dupe. Please. It's the best tool I have ever used.
It was a phenomenal palette Tati!! And the enchanted palette was beautiful!! I will be praying for you cause I don’t believe you are done!!
I'm gonna call this a "Diet Scandal" lol
I wish I could get your volume 1 palette 😭
I am so sad that your brand had to close😔😔  I hope somehow, someday, you can get your brand back❤️  I have your textured neutrals pallet and it is one of my absolute favourites!
I love how mature you are about this discussion and pray that you can get back into makeup creation. Your Vol1 palette is/was absolutely incredible and I'd LOVE to see what other ideas you have. You're truly a role model. I'm so glad that you're back (though I know it's not recent), and thank you for sharing this moment.
I really think you should reinvent a new makeup brand, you were meant to create beautiful makeup products!!!!
anyone know which brand stole the idea?
Well GOD had a much bigger plan for you. I don't think you realize how many people you effect. I know I'm one. No matter how upset or mad or sad I am, I just say I need my TATI fix! You have gotten me through more than you can ever know and I know I speak for us all when I say THANK YOU TATI! WE TRULY,TRULY LOVE YOU! 💞💞💞
I'm so sad that tati beauty closed I use my blendiful everyday and I've hit pan in most of my shades of the textured neutrals palette. I really hope you come back and continue the "book" theme!
Omgosh.  This hair color on you is THE BEST! You look younger and everything. Look amazing!
Butterfly monarch program mind control
Thats horrible Tati! I’m sorry you’ve been  dealing with it!!! Is just another punch to show how strong you are to keep moving forward! 🙏🏼 God bless 😘
bring bad tati beauty 🥲
Gurl come to Austin, let’s make a gurl hangout and throw in ideas and suggestions, lol f it let’s invest in your business as fans, see what comes out 😅
I still love my Tati palette and TOTALLY would have bought the Enchanted one. 🥺 That purple and green is gorgeous!  People suck.
Ur helping my day 2day
I live under. Rock! Thanks for letting us know!! Also I have volume1!!
Ignoring the actual content of the video but you're so positive! You seem so happy again in this video. I'm so excited for you. 😍
You look stunning! Hair, makeup, everything 🤩
Tati, after watching the docuseries "Not So Pretty", I sincerely hope that you will dive into the world of creating clean beauty. That would be amazing! Keep up the great work!
Girl I get the gist of what you are saying.  I am totally reading between the lines...You spoke carefully and candidly within the bounds of your legal matters.  I won't say what I think is going on, but I am pretty sure with the way you spoke (saying a lot without saying it) gives several clues to the situation.  Hypothetically I am guessing it was someone with access to your products Someone important in the organization. A higher up so to speak...just my opinion.  I am pretty good at figuring this stuff out.  My guesses are usually pretty spot on.  Well I did speak about what I think is going on...so there's that...I don't feel like going back and editing all of this...  You are the bomb.  I am happy for you living in a place you love.
Love my Volume 1!!! Begging you to continue to make face/eye pallets!! You are excellent at color arrangement and I appreciate the advice you give us in EVERY VIDEO. THANK YOU !!!!
Love those rings you have on....but I can't help but notice you don't have your wedding ring on....how come?  Anyone?
Bless you Tati. Keep being creative and being beautiful you 🥰
that quote at the end really gave me chills, this situation aside it really struck a chord with me, thank u for sharing !!
If you want to get to the palette cuz you don’t have time to watch the whole thing.. 14:00
Tati you are looking absolutely RADIANT!!! You always look gorgeous but something is different this time. Our youtube makeup mommy is ❤️‍🔥GLOWING❤️‍🔥
I hope you learned a lot of lessons about how shady some people can be when you work hard and achieve success and their hearts fill with envy. I hope you took notes. I hope you save those notes and the names of a few kick-ass attorneys and I hope you will use them when you open your new company because you should ABSOLUTELY do that. What they did to you is terrible but I hope you won't let the story end there. I hope you get back up from this with such force, that whatever you new venture is,  literally makes ALL who got in your way, regret they ever did and wish they had been nice to you. Trust that you went through this for a reason. You are stronger now and you need to take your rightful place, a place your carved for yourself with your work and your sacrifice. Let no one take that from you. I say call the new company Beauty by Tati just to slap them in the face and call it a day. Whenever you are ready. We are waiting patiently. No pressure.
I cannot wait to buy whatever you out with next. Your still our sis and I support you!
Tati I wish that you could have seen your dreams with Tati Beauty become a reality. I will pray that God provides a new and unexpected dream for you that will be even more fulfilling then Tati Beauty.
You look super fabulous here Tati. Really. Also, I am gutted I can’t buy this from you. Your palette is my absolute favorite.
Bought your first pallet for my daughter. We were getting ready for a destination wedding. Those powders were beautiful! I was so looking forward to further pallets.
If it’s not the finished product then why were so many manufactured??? I think the truth is being stretched here. That’s my opinion
You are looking radiant!! And I love this background!!
We love you Tati! Texas is the best state I’ve ever lived in. Maybe I’ll bump into you at Highland Park Village.
I remember when that first popped up. I thought it was photoshopped or some kind of wannabe knock off. I am sooo sorry they stole from you!! I hope there was a return address on the package you got lol 🤍💜xoxo
I so badly wish I could have gotten the Tati vol. 1 😭 I’m sorry so sorry this happened to you but holy moly the growth baby!
I'm in a weird mood and just thinking about how in an alternate universe COVID didn't happen, that palette (and the next few launches made it to market, and we'd still be here, watching and supporting Tati.   There are many paths to the same destination, some are on the scenic route but everything happens as it should.
I hope you can come back with a makeup brand ! I absolutely love my eyeshadow palette 😭 and this palette looks gorgeous
Omg just get to it!!!!
The black broke in my OG palette and I have never been so devastated about a color before 😭😭😭 I'd still buy any product from you in a heart beat!
Stronger than you know!!
👑
So inspired by your resiliency and grace. You continue to grow and inspire me year after year.
I do hope you get to build up a new company and launch as many collections as you can dream. I’ll buy them all if they’re as gorgeous and as excellent as the first Volume.    Don’t give up, Tati. You still have much to give to the world.
Texture natural got me to start purchasing eyeshadows it my favorite.
Your future's gonna be bright...in whatever direction your creativity takes you! ❤
Tatiiiii all that is in the past, but now…. we👏🏼are👏🏼waiting 👏🏼for👏🏼your 👏🏼new 👏🏼brand👏🏼…. PLEASE!!!!!!
Hearing about the palettes that never were 😢
Looking forward to purchasing your future launches. I'm so happy your thriving in Texas ❤️ and I'm sorry that palette was stolen 🤦🏼‍♀️ Karma will get them! Love your channel so much! Hugs 🫂🥰❤️
💜💜💜🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗 I ADORE my volume 1 palette.  One of the BEST quality shadow I have ever used.  Thank you for giving us such a beautiful moment.  Hugs and love.
You are on the path to great dreams accomplishments. Can’t wait to see what’s next🙏💝🙏
Some of the girls in my makeup group have this palette.
I love volume 1 and wish Tati beauty was still a thing!!!!!!!
Your eye shadow palette was the best I've ever used & your blender is incredible, I still use mine.
8 minute mark is when she dives into the story!
Still so sad I never got the chance to purchase anything from the company:(
Tati, I so appreciate you!  Beautiful inside & out.♥️. Your make up today….gorgeous!  We will be here waiting till that future time when we see your newest creation!
There is no word "copywritten." It is "copyrighted." Just an FYI for your legal matters!
If it hasn't been approved into a launch, why there is an inventory of it? Wouldn't it be couple (2-7 items) to thorough test and it's it?
That lighting is e.ve.ry.thiiiing!!!
Im so sorry for the loose... 😞 I'm so in love with the first palette and is on my eyes every week!! 💝
Seriously wish you could launch more pallets
When my brother and sisters died within 1.5 years apart. I fell into a very dark place and didn't care for makeup anymore. I gave away everything that wasn't used and threw away the used. All except 2 palettes. Your palette and the original Jaclyn Hill palette. I dont think I will ever get back in to makeup. Its been 2 years since I've wore any or even played in makeup. But with that said, I would have bought this palette also, just to have bc you're my favorite. ❤
I wish you would still offer the blender to us. I so want another one.
Thank you for this, because as great as your original palette was, I would have wanted thus as well, but will patiently wait until the real next one is launched!
Me seeing that palette 😢 so pretty
Oh it looked really pretty! 🦋🦋
your OG palette is still amazing. also so funny you are over the butterflies because everytime I see the emoji I think of you now hahahaha
Can these things just stop happening to you? Seriously, I just want you to have peace
My main motivation to get married as soon as possible is to be able to use my Tati Beauty palette on my wedding day😂
Tati, Im sorry this has happened... its like someone stealing your child almost... A thought I had is this,  we much as you loved creating for the Tati beauty line and then seeing everything that happened with it maybe that was God telling you, "not yet " or maybe He had something even bigger and better for you......I  know it's been so hard on you to go through all you have but, I truly believe God has something much better in store for you.  ❤❤❤❤❤
Can you please release a mauve textures palette?!
I literally do not understand how diversion is such an issue. As a hair stylist it’s such a frustrating problem, I can’t IMAGINE how awful it would be to see your own creation being diverted like that :/
Love you Tati!!  We are all here for you. 🖤. Thank you for the explanation. Wishing you the best.
You are amazing Tati! 🦋🦋🦋  I love butterflies so I will wait until you bring my butterfly pallet 🐛🐛🐛🦋🦋🦋
I love your background !
Really sad cause your talent is insane and I would have bought it all. But also just angry you got f’ed with
But girl Texas tho??? You really wanna support that economy when they don’t support women’s rights?! Gurrrrllllll
Tati maybe this isn’t the place for this but can you PLEASE do an updated under eye routine? Cover circles/ primers/ overnight moisturizers ?!
If it is something that you want.. I am praying for the day you can reinvent your brand & we have access to your beautiful products again.
Tati as many others have already said this is my favorite palette. You are the first person I followed on YouTube in regards to make-up. I gave your Blendiful as gifts to my sisters. I have learned so much from you. Purchasing your products was my way of giving back to you for all that you’ve given of yourself. Someday very soon I hope to be able to do that again. Thank you for returning. May God continue to bless you daily. You have this and He has you.
I still have two of your original pallets because I loved your pressed glitters so much. It makes me so sad and I really hope you start another brand like Tati beauty 2 lol
Dam Girl, you look great! Your aura is shinning!✨
I love my Tati Beauty palette Volume 1! 🥰 My favorite palette of all time. 💜
You are a genius 😍😍😍😍😍😚😍😍
Tati, you are glowing. I can see how the change of environment has definitely enlighten you.
I hope you can start Tati Beauty back up or another makeup line. I need new blendifuls! I still have my Vol. 1 pallet & even once I stop using it, I probably won't get rid of it for a while 💜 I'm still really proud of you for all that you've accomplished
I get compliments every time I wear volume 1!!!!!
OMG!!!!
If it was just a sample and it wasn't really your textures and all of that why would you have created so many pallets a whole truck full? That seems like a waste the story is not true.
I honestly wish some cosmetic company/investor sees this and recognises Tati’s passion and helps her dream come true! We all know we’ll get an amazing makeup collection that’s full of quality and beauty from her!!
Literally looking at my Tati Beauty pallette across from me rn. I love it and you 🖤
I'm honestly sorry that all of this happened to you, but to see you come back with such positivity and grace is just beautiful. After all the bad you went through, you still came out good. I appreciate that so much and it gives me strength to go through stuff too. Thanks for staying you're true self, tati ❤️
Tati we need a hair tutorial!!!!!!
Watching this gave me a migraine. Like, what even is this besides click bait? What is the point of this? This could have been a social media post or a 5 minute video. I'm out after like, 3 years. I'm over it. Not just because of this video. It's just way too much dramatic bs for me and constant pitching/planning to pitch/ulterior motives. Literally sick of it. ✌️
Oh for goodness sake! I thought a new palette was being released. My fault, I should’ve known better! Damn clickbait!
starstruck by how you handled it so gracefully. tbh i wish it wasn't over. this palette really spoke to me, i hope you'll find a way to work on your brand. but whatever is yet to come, i'll be IN 100%. Love you.
Yes this pallette is so beautiful and I wish I could of been able to seen it be launched.
Girl, your move to Texas actually shows through your tone and mannerisms. It’s crazy how evident it is.
I am sorry to hear that this happened. You certainly seem to be handling this with grace.
Wow Tati, I’m so sorry that happened to you! ☹️ It’s just terrible!  Sending you love 💕
Well shoot. I would have LOVED that palette.
Will you ever offer your 1st palette again? That’s my jam & I need to buy a new one as some colors have hit pan & I don’t know what I will do when I run out of my favorites!
So sorry this happened. Short-term gains will never get someone to the finish line faster. I hope these criminals are found and held accountable for their actions.
I remember seeing a photo ages ago of this palette but then heard nothing else, so I dismissed it as just a good looking fake. So sorry this happened to the products and you and your team. But Im glad you can take a step back and still be proud of the company you built - you've worked so hard and deserve all the success! <3
You have to believe there is always a silver lining to a terrible situation. No such thing as a coincidence either. Tati you are much stronger than you give yourself credit for!!
I would counterattack this insult with a legit launch of same or similar pallet.  Show them who's boss!
I’m SO sad this palette wasn’t ever released. It’s greens and purples 😩😩😩 my absolutely FAVES.  Maybe one day she’ll make another brand for makeup
Lobbying for Westbrook beauty!
i like to think that there’s a universe out there where covid did not ravage the last few years and Tati Beauty stood strong. and this pallet is being enjoyed by everyone who loves you most in that universe. you’re such a wonderful soul Tati. thank you for continuing this youtube journey ♥️
We would be here for new Tati  cosmetics….❤❤
I had NO CLUE this shit was going on!    I’m so glad people gave you the respect to be quiet about it.   I love my volume 1 palette.   I’ll never get rid of it.  And I love your thoughts of putting your big girl lashes on.   Sending love 😘😘❤️❤️
I don’t think it is dated. I’d buy it in a second but obviously won’t understanding the circumstances now. It makes me sad though. It’s beautiful.
I am hurt for you. Truly a gut punch 😢 I'm sorry
Girlllll you look 25yrs young in this video! The dark hair is ittttt on you!
I've watched you since 2014. I just moved to AZ in October and I'm so sad you're in Dallas when I just left! 😭 Please be careful Dallas can be beautiful but it is very dangerous. I really hope you enjoy all the really good food they have. ❤️
I am so sorry this happened to you . I pray you come out with more cosmetics . We love and respect you . If God  takes you to it , he will get you through it . I bought the original palate , love it . It’s iconic so I don’t use it much now . Need to hang on to you . Sounds weird ,but that’s how I feel . God bless you always . Come put with foundation and next brow products ,as we all know that’s your favorite. Just imagine you make the ultimate brow product . I see it now! Just do it .
Tati please make makeup again :(
Your words are an inspiration and I can't wait to see what else you will create because that palette, damn girl!!!!
I really hope you find a way to keep your vision going (if you want to)!! Your products were amazing!
I want Tati Beauty to come back so bad 😭😭 I will ONLY use my Vol 1 palette for special occasions bc I know I can’t repurchase it 😭
I totally would have bought that palette if you had launched it
this thumbnail is honestly amazing
So, you're saying there's a chance!
I really wish I still had my volume 1 palette 😢 it was stolen from me </3 ughhhh 😢😢😢
I can’t believe someone stole it off a truck like what 😒 so horrible.
My God can this woman rant like a bxtch!! 🤯😱😵 like get to the effing point woman!
Yay for the big girl lashes! Everything is bigger and better in Texas! Loving having you as a “neighbor”. Super cool to show the quality and time you put into items that would benefit customers and exceed expectations. So happy your desire to create perseveres. Your next chapter shall be even greater I’m certain! To the next Mary Kay circa 2022!!! So many beauty companies are here in Texas- YOU WILL RISE!
Keep being the light Tati, the rest will fade away! It’s all in His plan! Your voice for His purpose, keep shining!!! And…you look amazingly happy in this video despite the message! There is no price that can be placed on peace!
So sad that this happened! I love Tati and her palette! I’ve been watching since middle school. I hope something will come in the future because her innovation in the beauty community is outstanding. I can’t wait for the gap to be filled back in!
Oh. My. Goodness. I am so sad that pallet didn’t get to be sold!  I love those colors!!!
TATI, I know I’m not the only one that must be thinking this but couldn’t you put out another cosmetics line under let’s say the Westbrook name or a different name?
I’m so sorry, Tati! You are an amazing person! It’s nice to see you defend yourself in such a kind and respectful way, it’s admirable! If, one day you do decide to sell makeup, I’d be interested in that but I wouldn’t pay someone for stolen product! That’s terrible and maybe some people just didn’t know all the details or that it was stolen and that’s why they bought it……idk but I’m happy that you cleared up all the confusion for everyone. ♥️
So sorry you’ve been through so much and that this launch was taken away from you. It’s obvious though that you have risen above these hardships and are somehow a stronger, happier person. It’s great to see you thrive. I can’t wait to see where your creativity leads next! God bless!
I’m ready for a new brand lol or Tati beauty back!
😂
Oh my gosh- it is gorgeous!! 😥
The glitter for Believe 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭 I feel so fricken robbed. I feel like there's a shitty joke there and in sorry, but I do. The color story on that palette was just lovely. Keep on keeping on, tati. I can't wait until the day you drop another launch video for us ❤️
OMG! I saw it for sale and thought it was fake
A NEW PALETTE   Edit: I read the comments
Getting emotional cause drama channels had some integrity is normal human behavior especially when those channels can cause so much damage and drama
I'm thinking Elon Musk needs to buy you a cosmetics company so we can get this palette for real.
Tati - Any palette you create I am buying. Love you girl. Thanks for letting me know. Thanks for sharing.I definitely will not purchase that palette online. 🥰
Really hope that when all the legal dust settles you’re able to relaunch Tati Beauty 2.0
It’s a pretty palette 🎨
Tati. I know you need your time. But PLEASE relaunch tati beauty, or make another makeup brand. I’ve been watching you since 2016 and I was waiting for all of it. I was lucky enough to get one of your palettes but your products are literally art. I want to use it but I’m afraid to run out of it. Your makeup is literally the best makeup I’ve ever used and as a makeup artist. WE NEED IT. But take your time of course I just love it😭
What is on your eyes?!
Bring Tati Beauty back PLS 🥹
Tati, I'm standing by for whenever you release another pallette.   My Vol 1 is getting lonely.   😊
WHATTTTT
It's crazy that you have to still deal with all this nonsense and now illegal selling of your almost/could have been second pallet. We all are seriously supporting you every step of the way, Tati! ❤️ I'm sure we will all be absolutely thrilled when you can have your creative freedom back  and you do launch something again. Love you xo
Open Tati Cosmetics girl!!!
not me currently being in love with purples and greens right now. wish tati would have been able to launch this product :(
Lmao loving Texas until summer really slaps you in the face. 110 days no thanks.
Social media is very over rated.
I'm thrilled to hear that you are starting to get back into the creative groove. 😍
Always such grace with Tati.
I thought she was going to say she was relaunching 🥺
Love your quotes! Beautiful is your story to tell & the stars fall softly like confetti to my soul! Absolutely beautiful! Thank you for helping me with my mental health & mood boards
I’m so mad I want this palette so bad. The first palette was so amazing…
Inspiration
What a launch that would have been. Still madly in love with my Volume 1 💕 …and can you tell us about your hair routine (product recommendations)? It looks amazing.
I love my original eyeshadow palette, and I NEED back ups and to be able to repurchase it again.
Please keep vlogging!!!
BTW the palette Idea just beautiful if you were to launched I would it buy it. Hope everything get sorted soon 🙏
Truly saddened for the whole situation 😞 You put your all into everything you’re passionate about. And it comes through in the things you create - your videos, the palette, Halo 🥰 looking forward to your next big idea/creation 😊
Tati, you are such a beautiful soul! God has a wonderful plan for your life and while I  along with many others would have adored this palette, perhaps God had a reason why it didn’t come to pass... I’m praying for God’s absolute BEST for you, Tati! Brighter days are surely ahead! ❤️🙏
i wanted another palette from you so bad i would buy that in a second. ive enjoyed your palette so much
I have tears of joy in my eyes after you shared how reinvigorated you are. I love that you’re coming out of the darkness and beginning to shine again ❤
Tati I wonder why  people are doing you so much wrong. I will pray to the universe this kind of things stop happening to you and get you the happiness you deserve. Ugh I don't understand why someone would do this. It's like investing time just to bad.
I’m just glad I have the first palette and an unopened blendaful, I so wanted to buy that PR book thing!! That would have been a great idea to sell them. Not into the second one but I’m sure I would have bought it anyways lol
I'm so so sad that your company is gone. Your palette is my favorite ever. And I love the blendiful!  I'm so sad this palette isn't going to come out because it's so fun and lovely!
How can we help? We need YOUR brand... TW Beauty!
I hate that this happened to you however I'm glad your doing better. I wish I could have a had a chance to buy the textured neutral palette but time were hard for me. Have you considered starting another makeup line?
I would give my left arm for the Textured Neutrals Vol. 2 palette 😭 I was so heartbroken when Tati Beauty shut down. My textured neutrals volume 1 palette is my all-time favorite palette.
You look gorgeous 💕
Well if it helps, I have not seen it being sold anywhere
Oh no! This is such a tease 😭🤣 I thought this was going to be some news of a new launch. I so regret not being able to get the Blendiful and Tati Beauty palette. The colours of the palette that wasn't meant to be are gorgeous and I want it too!  I hope you get another brand/launch up and running soon!
Just wanted to send my love. This palette looks beautiful! Still have my volume 1 palette and bought it for every female I know. Hands down the best palette I've ever owned! 🥰
Sad that this happened and caused confusion. Also welcome to Texas! Louisiana native here living in Houston.  You should head next door and experience all the good food in south Louisiana some time! And I bet bluebonnets are still in bloom in your area of Tx, btw, if you haven't done that yet.
Omg I want this. I won’t buy it unless you do come out with it down the road. I hope you get to come back with makeup. You’re the only influencer I trust.
I would love to see Tati sell each color row as a quad. That way I could just buy the colors I would use up and not have to buy a whole new pallet to replace them.
Hear me out… Tati and Marlena both live in TX now… maybe they can create a brand together! It would be incredible 😭
My volume 1 Tati Beauty palette is absolutely my most prized possession. ❤️  I always get an insane amount of compliments when I wear it because every aspect is instantly gorgeous and easy! 🌈 Can't wait to see you creating again and I'm sorry all of this happened 💔
It sucks so much how it all happened. I want to buy another palette and blendiful SO badly. So sorry this happened to you.
So you could say it was like a middle step to a final product? Like you made some knowing you would make changes before the final one was brought to market?
Everything you have created has been nothing but a hit, you don’t owe the beauty community an apology for your haters stealing your ideas. We believe in you 💯 percent and we cannot wait to be the first to share your next launch.
still holding out hope that she had to close tati beauty for legal reasons and will eventually launch another makeup brand under a different name 😭❤️ her first few products were amazing and I know her creativity and passion for makeup would have yielded an AMAZING cosmetics line !!! so I’m not giving up hope for another tati makeup line in the future 😤💖
I love my tati beauty vol 1 pallet. I hope one day, you reopen tati beauty. As a support from back when you did madness monday I always knew you had a good eye for good makeup. Hopefully one day maybe soon you will reopen tati beauty. All my luv Emily ❤️.
Whatever is meant for you will always be yours. If you release it 3 years from now, 20 years from now, never… it all worked out for your good.
Man i wish i could see you use that palette..
I’m sad your cosmetic line ended, but you are still a creative genius and I feel like that passion and creativity could still get put to good use!! Have you ever considered doing a collab with a brand?
Ah Tati, I hope you can write your next chapter in a new beauty biz. Just love your spirit! 😘
By the thumbnail it looks like my perfect palette I love that color scheme I would’ve bought it for sure gorgeous concept
First and most important you look so stunning, strong and at peace. What the enemy meant for evil I know God will turn your story around. Though your name may be on the “almost,” God knew what was coming and he will stamp his name on the finished!  Seriously know that your dreams are held by him. 💕
I’m so sorry you have been a victim of stolen ideas and something that was yours. But just that you know a seed sown for good or for wrong motives. God knows our hearts and he gives back 7 fold what the enemy has stolen. Your in a good place and dreams still coming true. Stay full of Grace and forgiveness and you can’t fail no matter what was stolen God restores better than imagined.💜🌈💜🦋🦋🦋🦋🙏🕊🙏
No tati you must come out with another palette. I missed out on your vol 1 palette and I regret it
Wish you could just start a new makeup brand with a new name and sell these products because your ideas sound so good 😩
This is so Terrible Tati that someone would do this kinda thing. Shows how messed up the world is I guess. My heart goes out to u bc I know this is stressful and heart breaking. ❤️   That being said is this the only video we get this wk? I look forward to ur makeup videos every wk and we only get 1. Please tell me this won't be it for this wk. Like I will be so bummed to wait an entire nother wk to watch a reg video. 🤞🙏❤
i can only imagine all the emotions you've felt/feeling for ALL of this. I'm so sorry. hopefully i run into you someday just to say hi. i moved to fw recently as well(yes fw is not Burleson i know) so who knows! Blessings to you and NEVER STOP CREATING❤✌🏻
Will you please recommend dupes from your first palette? Particularly the sequin row?
People are grimy,  they will do anything to make a buck,  even if it destroys somebody's reputation, somebody's life , somebody's dream.  I'm glad you're in a space where you can handle this now and not so stressed.  we are proud of you and we're glad to see you back don't let this get to you,  your fans will know and that's what matters and you will know that's what matters more we love you
Can you do a tutorial on how you did your hair for this video? 😬
Tati....after your first launch...I would literally day dream about future Volumes of that eyeshadow palette. I don't think I had looked forward to a companies future releases ever as much I did for Tati Beauty. But.....unfortunately...it is what it is. You're sad and we are too.  I know it has to hurt but everything happens for a reason. I have no idea if you are able to launch a beauty company again down the road. Many people do that kind of thing. Rebrand themselves and start over a few years down the line. But, I use your Textured Neutrals palette so much and I am hitting pan on a few of the shadows (sniffles).  The Beauty industry is tough....and I do mean tough so if someone is selling a mocked up version of something you were working on...that's a bummer. But, legally they can probably do it since you didn't rubber stamp it and you've legally closed shop. PLEASE....for the love of makeup and for you and and us....please consider rebranding down the road. Sending hugs.
I love the Tati Beauty pallet. I have it and bam so proud to own it. Sending you Good Vibes moving forward. Sorry that happened to you.
Do you think someday you will start a new company to create makeup and beauty products?
I’d just make a new brand called Tati or Tati cosmetics or something ❤️
Tati,  Thank you for sharing this information. I sometimes search online hoping to find someone who has your original palette and wants to sell it unused.I was hoping to get it when it came out but missed it. To think someone would steal this second one and sell it without your approval, as well as without the final ok that it was safe…..I hope they are caught!  Btw, your hair and makeup are absolutely beautiful! If this is your big girl look, I want to grow up to look like you! I’m 60 years young, lol! We can all dream can’t we! Love you
You are truly a special one 💕 I hope in the future that maybe one day you can create makeup again and feel free about it XoxoX we love and support you!!!
I’m just so glad I got the Tati palette and bought one for my girls when they launched. Still one of my favorite palettes I have! ❤️ I’ll always watch your videos!
never give up on your dreams🥰
Your hair looks so healthy and beautiful!! I admire how you have fought through the storms and always see the rainbow side of things. You are a beautiful person inside and out.
Are enough made to be stolen & sold if a product is unapproved? I understand it's past the time but it was never approved even.
Tati I'm happy your here in Texas....but there's a lot of people who are not happy about ppl moving here from CA or Seattle..because they don't want our State to turn Blue...it's actually a thing here...Dallas is blue Ft Worth is Red 😂😂 hoping you don't get caught up in this stigma..because the women here in Texas are fighters...😉 very polical State..
I could tell you was about to launch another pallet and this is biter sweet and I haven't even seen it and I wish I could have had the privilege  when all that BS happen I hate it when it happened to you but it really sckd for your fans 2 but you will rebuild your business again and it will be even better💯🙏💜💙💜💙
went to order the volume 1 palette the DAY she announced there’s would be no more and I missed it. Still sad 😢😢😢😢
I am devastated that this never came to fruition! It is GORGEOUS! So sorry this happened to you Tati. Sending hugs your way.
I dont know the ins and outs of your legal situation, but why dont you just rerelease all the tati beauty products under halo beauty?? Halo can be more than just vitamins! Please live your passion if having a makeup line is what you loved!
Oh Tati. How I wish I could buy all those items you dreamed of creating. I treasure my Tati palette so much. It’s absolutely gorgeous. Im so sorry this happened to you ♥️
Tati, you look so beautiful!!  I'm sorry this happened to you.
Wish that creativity can come alive soon!
Love you my girl. We are all behind you. Can't wait to see what the future holds fir you. 🤗
Thanks for your honesty and being open and real.People may have pulled the rug out from under  but they can't take away our love and support for you.
Love you Tati✨💖✨you have been through it girl! Learning and moving forward is such a beautiful thing. You are blessed😇
I love butterflies and have since I was a little girl 🦋Then the Lord have me this scripture when I was in m 20’s II Corinthians 5:17😇🙏🦋😘😘😘😘Gods got you girl!
I love volume 1, the sequin finish is everything
My number one regret, not buying your first pallette when I had the chance! 😭😭😭
If this would’ve released, it would’ve been a huge hit! Kind of bittersweet that we can’t purchase it, but grateful for you even sharing! Love your resiliency throughout it all! ❤❤❤
Please collab and make that textured neutrals two! Omg I was waiting for the cool tones. Love you Tati.
I don’t have any social media except for Pinterest and YouTube I just decided to delete it all it was becoming toxic and a massive distraction for my schoolwork but I didn’t know about this until now so that’s cool
I love u so much tatiii ur sad voice is breaking my heart 💖😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘 7
Can you please create more cosmetics you products were sooo amazing
What is this world coming to. The fact you have to do this is just sad. Bad people will get the karma they deserve. Love that you still did the glitter, metallic, sequin and matte rows. I just love my volume 1!!
I feel really bad that your prototype was diverted and that people are buying it under your name. The newer pallet color scheme resonates with me more than the original dead as I don’t typically wear warm or vivid colors.  I do believe that you still have the creative mojo and the drive to make it work and I know things haven’t worked out terribly well for you the last few years.  Keep the faith, Tati, God has your back.
I wish I had bought a second textured neutrals palette
Ok I had no idea any of this was going on.... this is nuts! But goddamn I love the colors! I really wish there was a way you could make a version of this in the future :(  dude I love the ideas for packaging and everything you described.... im so sad because I love these colors, especially the purple and blue! I hope the people can be caught and stopped
This is so insane! But I do hope if you ever create makeup again, it will be amazing 💕
If you ever want to venture into creating cosmetics again, you already have so much support behind you. I wish we could have experienced all you had envisioned.
Am I the only one who’s glad they didn’t all end up in a landfill?
I’m wearing volume 1 for my wedding. I love it so much and I’m so sad that I won’t be able to replace it!
If Tati Beauty ever gets a chance to re-launch, I am ready to purchase.
That would have been a beautiful palette Tati!  I also still have your Vol 1 Tati Beauty. Hopefully you can create something beautiful in the near future ✨✨✨🙌❤️
You are so special and such a positive person, those of us who “know” you, know better! ❤️
I’m still kicking myself for not buying the first Tati Beauty palette. I was hoping that it would go on sale a little later and that never happened so I missed my chance.
You look STUNNING 🤩 your makeup, your hair, EVERYTHINGGGG
Are you going to rebrand on your own and continue on with what Tati Beauty would have been?
This video deserves all the thumbs up. 💕 Your honesty & genuineness is so refreshing and makes  me hope that you will eventually create again.  Literally the best pallet I own and sadly mine is almost all hitting pan.  Still love wearing them though! 💕  Chin up Tati, you were born to create!  Big Texas hugs!
I just wanted to let you know how sad I am for you that all of your products and plans and dreams about future products have been destroyed.
The cooler toned neutral palatte, ugh 💔 I would have loved that beyond belief
We need Tati Beauty Volume 2. Please please please!
I hate hate that you didn’t have your moment. The makeup we could all be using right now would be unbelievable. I’ve been watching you for over 6 years now and I wanted to just cry because of everything that happened. You deserve so much. I don’t know you personally but just from you videos i feel like I know you. I hate we could experience this pallet I definitely would have bought it. I have the textured neutrals and the blendiful and I still use them on special occasions😂 I don’t wanna not have them so I’m taking my time. lol I’m sending so many prayers and good vibes your way.
My niece, a make-up artist and hair stylist, were talking two weeks ago how your palette is our favorite and how sad we are that there won't be a follow-up.  It's still one of my five or so "go-to's".
I am so sorry you had this theft but happy you are moving forward.  I love this palette and wish I could have gotten it  Can't wait to see what else you create.  Hugs Diana
I didn’t buy the first palette because I wasn’t into neutrals at the time but now I mainly wear neutrals and I wish I got it 😭
This made me so sad for you, Tati 💜 I always wondered what else you had for collections and ideas so thank you for sharing… they would’ve all been stunning and I would’ve purchased them all 🤩😘 I love that “Ever” color so so much 💚💚💚
Will you ever do a beauty product again Tati? Under a new brand name?
Tati you are so gorgeous
I hope to god she opens another beauty brand
The Tati palette was/is my all time favorite palette, and I STILL HAVE HOPE THAT TATI BEAUTY WILL BE BACK! Maybe I'm in denial, but damn it, I want more Tati shadows. It's not over!! This was beautiful, I'm sorry it got stolen from you!
Wow I’m so sorry people are just absolutely and I’m gonna say it ignorant to steal from you and your brand like this truly disgusting Tati im so sorry 😞 ugh people these days man !! No matter what the idea was beautiful and I’m glad you spoke on it thanks for clearing this up!
I love your videos tati. Id LOVE if you put out some music. Your voice is so gorgeous!!
Here to support you and your creativity no matter what avenue you take!
The Texas sun does a mind good love the way you handled this , sorry you even had to go through it. You’re a strong women ! Much love ! Hope to run into one day here in Dallas or Fort Worth !!
Tati, we need a tutorial on this hair :)
You are so strong, Tati! Lesser ppl would of crumbled. I'm so sad that "almost"never happened. I would of scooped up that palette too. Still in love with Textured Neutrals Vol. 1. Still hopefully in the future for more palettes. Much love 💜💜
I would’ve lived for a Tati cool-toned palette. That said, I’d rather you be happy and not heartbroken by it. You’re in a better place, now. If you ever have the chance to create, again, I feel like you will enjoy it, more. We all just want you to be happy.
What I would give to have been able to add this to my vol 1. Palette. This would’ve been everything ❤️💔 I can’t wait to see what the future holds.
That’s so horrible that people got a hold of those pallets
So crazy this came up today. I was using Vol 1 yesterday thinking about what I’m gonna do once that pallet is toast 😢🥺
This gorgeous, smart, tenacious & resilient woman can not catch a break. Chris Crocker: LEAVE TATI ALONE!
I love love love my Tati palette! The 2nd one was gorgeous. Loved the blendiful. I will be waiting to see what you come out with next.
As a book and makeup lover, the idea of the “book look” for palettes would be AMAZING!! I never was able to purchase the first palette so, I’m excited for the future of what you will create. I DO know you WILL create beautiful things in the future. Stay strong with your faith, with God all things are possible.
Your background is flawless. You’ve always have great taste decorating.
My brain went: THAT GREEN IS PERFECT I WANT IT I NEED IT. Then I heard the story and was like... Damn u_u I'm sorry that happened.
Tati it’s like you’re opening a recently closed wound. I want so badly to buy anything and everything from Tati beauty. Your palette is a go to and I’m super bummed we can’t buy from you! Plus textured neutrals 2 sounds right up my alley!! Sorry this happened to you! We support you!
How devastating!! Everything about this is crazy!! You look stunning today❤️
Tatiiiii this plays with my little makeup loving heart T_T I was so excited when I saw the title, then saw the thumbnail and went "noooo!" I still use my palette 1 daily. It's my go to. I'm still so sad that we never got to have more. Freaking jerks getting in the way of your brand UGGH anyway listen I had to pause 4 minutes in to post this comment. I will likely post again after seeing the product itself.  Also that's wonderful about the drama channels :)
Tati, you should create your line again. That was your dream and you are incredible at it. I hate that someone has stomped all over your brand. This is yours. Take it back. You deserve this makeup line.
If I’m not mistaken the theft of these items that have not been sanctioned by you for sale under your name and then marketed as your product is malevolent and it’s also probably a federal crime.
You can absolutely create and sell makeup again. That part of your life is in no way over. I love my palette and still use it constantly. I bought it for so many friends, and I very much look forward to your next release ♥️
This makes me so sad. I hope one day you are able to create another make up line. I love my Tati beauty volume 1 pallette. I use it very sparingly because I know I won't be able to get another :(. Wishing you all the best in this new happier chapter in your life!
What was the point of this video? It would've taken all of 3 sentences written on Instagram to explain why unofficial palettes were being sold. You didn't even discuss the actual palette you only talked about it being stolen. And then you talked about your first palette. Talk about clickbait?
One of my favorite palettes is Tati’s 💛
Excuse my ignorance, but what stops Tati from launching a new brand? Is it money? Legal stuff? Trauma? .. genuinely curious.   She seems to have this inside of her. Could she collaborate with an existing brand? Maybe recreate her products in a  slightly different  way under a brand new brand (like Taylor did with her old albums lol) idk sry
I wish I would have gotten the volume 1. It makes me sad I did not get one but you best believe I will get this.
Hi Tati, I’m sorry this happened  But make sure you feel your emotions, take a deep breath and remember is so many bigger and awesome things waiting for you. I’m sure I will see more on the future from you. Many blessings for you and your family 😀❤️
I'm so sad that you had to close shop because I love the volume one sooo much.
Just need you to get through all this hard stuff so we can get the beautiful stuff! Love the products you have created and hopefully will see more in the future.
Gutted I missed vol1 and hope it's re released x
The fact that you were obsessed by butterflies & then went through this beautiful transformation in real life is amazing. #lawofattraction #transformation #butterflies 🦋
Lovely!
Amazing strength!
I missed out on your palette and omg this one looks so beautiful- hopefully you’ll be able to launch products again❤
I am sorry for all of the heartache you have been through.  You have handled it with such grace.  I can’t help but say, though, I love this new Tati.  Your faith, your strength and grounded attitude is truly inspiring.  I believe God has a much better plan for you!  Also, this reminded me to dig out your palette and put it into my every day makeup drawer.  It’s one of the best!
Tati, welcome to TX!!  I am cheering for you and of course you should not give up on your dreams of being a creator , you are the queen of makeup and I am sad I didn’t get to buy your volume 1 palette, but I hope you are able to rebuild your brand again. Life is not over after covid and  legal issues , and I just hope that you can move forward and create more palettes, I would be eagerly waiting to buy more products from you . You look more relaxed and happy and you definitely deserve it !!  I support you wholeheartedly on your future endeavors…❤️❤️
If you decide to ever make this I will buy it and will not support anyone that steals things from you!!
I hope someday you can get back into this space and get your creativity into makeup releases again. I love my vol 1 and hit major pan on soothe matte
I hate so much that this was never released. It's stunning but hopefully in the future you can make something like this. So sorry for all of this trash you have to go threw. You truly are amazing and so strong. Xoxo
I am so sad that I was not able to get my hands on your first palette. I hope maybe one day you can release more makeup! I will not let it go past me this time!
Love your palette vol 1 has been absolutely one of the best I have tried. Please bring out another one!!!!
Ooohh, love the background decor 😍. Also, continued growth, peace & joy to you darlin'❤️🙏🏾✌🏾
Tati welcome to Texas!! Texas looks really good on you!!! I cant wait to see your future launches:)
I would have bought this palette in a second where the first one was too warm for me.
I'm confused, so if they stole a truckload of these palettes..ur saying they weren't a finished product.But those palettes are a finished product that's obvious or why else would u of made a truck load of them?No shade meant here ,just honestly confused.
Wow my heart shatters for you vol2 would’ve been my perfect palette
Tati I treasure the palette I have from you and I just hope someday you can find a way to launch your brand….I absolutely love my palette and use it all the time. ❤️
Tati, you are so stunning ! ❤️
I am so excited that you are back into the creative mindset!! I was so sad that I missed the volume 1 beauty palette and I can’t wait to see what you do next!! I look forward to your videos, I am having a really hard life with loosing my mom and trying to keep my vegan and gluten free bakery from going under and to watch your strength pull you from the dark gives me so much hope that I will also make it out of this. Life is really gloomy right now and your videos give me the light I need to keep going.
I love your hair 😍!!!
Tati you look STUNNING like OMG
Tati looking so fresh.. God is working so well
Uhgg those GREENS and purples 😭👌 Tati that pallet was beautiful regardless if it's not the finished product. It was down right beautiful
I missed the textured neutrals palette as I was a student when it came out and couldn’t afford it. I have no doubt that Tati will bring us beautiful products again soon.
Tati follow your dreams 🌈
I’m here for those purples and greens
Please tell me that this title is not clickbait..... a minute in and I really hope it's not clickbait
I’d watch more videos of things you had planned with Tati Beauty! I still wear Vol 1 every single day ✨ I was sooo looking forward to your cool toned volume.
Your hair looks amazing!!! Love the color!
Still using and loving my pallet!! Please please please bring back Tati beauty😭😭
I'm sad you have to go through this. And I'm sad for all of us fans that we'll be without your amazing products. I'm lucky I got your first
I wish Tati could make a Cool-Toned Volume 2!!! Would be amazing for those who prefer cools 😁
Love your original palette
I hope one day there is more Tati cosmetics. You are so talented! ❤️❤️❤️
I would have loved this palette. The volume 1 is my favorite formula of shadow ever and I’m so sad I can never get it again because I’m going to hit pan and I’m devastated. I hope you can relaunch the brand one day because that palette was everything I’ve ever wanted and needed from my eyeshadows. Much love 💕
Tati, I have no words. I have been following you since forever. Have you thought of writting a book? If I was CEO of Netflix, I would offer you the sweetest deal because no one could have imagined your story of just what happened in the last 5 years... And as you say it is YOUR story to tell... you are so resilient!
Missed out on Vol. 1, but so glad to see you happy!
Looking forward to what you have planned for the future.💗
Would love to see you do a brand again but on your own to avoid all the bs. I really wanted to buy your pallet but was waiting for more before I bought. 😭🙈
Please make the blendiful again & make skincare if not make up. 🙏🏼 love you T@
The purple 😍 definitely will NEED to see some makeup from Tati again!! I am invested in you girl!!
I’m so sorry this happened to you. There’s a lot more good people and then there’s a few not so good people. When you work so hard for your dream and then it’s broken of course you go through the feelings. However, I know you’re going to get back at it and whatever you choose to do is going to be even better. I can’t wait to see what your new creations will be. Keep being you, you’ve got this. I’m so happy that you’re loving being in our great state of Texas.
So you did a test run of palettes that would have gone into production after a few tweeks if your company hadn't closed. That product was stolen before it was destroyed & now is being sold illegally. Got it.
You’re looking really well Tati :)
I use my Volume 1 so sparingly because I’m gonna be so bummed when it’s gone. It’s my hands down favorite pallet.
This would have been such a lovely collection had it been fully confirmed and released. Part of me is happy seeing it but the other part is sad as it is a product we will never be able to have. Thank you for making this video and explaining this. I have seen the palette back in January and thought immediately that it is super beautiful. Love that you also included how you feel inspired to create and fell recharged! I am very excited for any makeup ventures you will dive in! 🥰
I would do questionable things for another Tati palette 🥺😭😢
As if you haven't been through enough. Seeing something you had envisaged being next in a collection sold illegally, must be gut wrenching. I can imagine just by seeing it at that stage how gorgeous the final product would have been. I still love the palette you launched. I've used it on so many clients. No matter what tomorrow is always a new day with a fresh clean start. Xxxxx
I just wished I could’ve got the first one by the time I got the money they weren’t selling anymore I love you TATI
One regret I will have never got to buy your first Tati pallet 😭😭😭😭 and I know for the lucky and blessed ones that got it. Say is ONE if not the BEST eyeshadow pallet ever
I’m so disappointed you never got the chance to launch this! It’s beautiful!
First, I'm sorry that all of this happened. I hope things turn out for the better soon.🥺 Second, if your heart calls you to have your own makeup brand YOU DESERVE TO HAVE YOUR OWN MAKEUP BRAND. I'm sure I'm not the only one who will support you if you choose to launch a new brand to continue pursuing your dreams and your goals. We can see how passionate you are about it. If you choose to try again in the future, we will be there for you❤
I love this palette.
Awww I would have bought the shit out of that palette and ordered a new neutrals. I use my blendiful daily. So sad :(
That palette is gorgeous! I would have loved to own it, and it makes me sad that there will be no more launches for Tati Beauty.  I hope one day she gets to launch a makeup brand again! I still use my Blendiful and love it!
Tati reading out the shadow names sounded like Kris Jenner talking about her grandchildren
I use the Tati vol 1 palette everyday since I got it and the face poof  ! I need more   The best thing ever
Sorry to hear this has happened to you. Glad to hear the police are looking into this. Xoxo
Since you have halo beauty couldnt you still release products under halo? Just make the makeup a division of halo?
I replaced my Volume 1 weeks before it became unavailable. I felt so glad. I never got a blendiful, but I see it used till this day by your friends. I will buy whatever you put out because I believe in your dreams and your calling!
Still so sad Tati Beauty is over. Still love my first palette, years later.
I have not heard a peep about all of this.
Damnit the title got me excited.
I have a genuine question. If the pallet was never intended to be sold, why were so many pallets made and packaged? That seems like a waste of money on your end to produce so many pallets that weren’t meant to be for sale. Just curious about the production process. So fascinating!
Girl - some people just want watch the world burn ! I hope they all pay for this shady shit !! I'm sorry you have to deal with this problem....
FWIW that color story is lovely. Wish it would have come to fruition.
It's honestly just so sad that all this happened to Tati. There are other businesses, especially beauty ones, that don't run their company well or don't care as much about their product quality and customer satisfaction as Tati Beauty did and they are still running and making money. It's upsetting that this was such a dream of Tati's to have and other people took it away before it could get even better. Some people don't deserve what they have made and Tati worked her company from the ground up and got it taken away. I'm so sorry Tati, I definitely see where this collection could've gone to with your creativity and I just hope the best for your future ❤
Omg...it looks so pretty! It's so sad that this never made it to market along with the Vol. 2.  People are so greedy to steal and take advantage of people. I love and treasure my Vol. 1 palette so much.
Obsessed with the horse at the back
I saw it on Mercari and a lot of phone were buying iy
Can't wait for your next chapter!  You are talented, loved & admired.  Thank you for sharing this story.🙌🏻💚🤟🏻💜🤗
i need to find this now
Gosh I wish I would’ve been in a place where I could have afforded the volume 1 pallet. It’s beautiful, and i feel like I missed out! 🥺🥺🥺
One day tati beauty will be back and beautiful than ever ❤ ♥ 💖
🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
I have my volume one and I wanted to follow in your book story this whole thing makes me super sad sad for you! Actually it makes me sick that somebody has tried and I emphasize the word tried to take your creativity and claim it as their own and I’m so happy to hear that you’re feeling that creativity again because you have this gift and I am intrigued and honored that you are sharing it with us and I can’t wait for what’s next and those of us who love you and follow will be here anxiously waiting! So proud that you took the time you needed came and explained and I’m here for it and I support you and I get it and I wish you the very very very best💜💜
You by chance have a box of the blendifuls? Cause I swear I’d give an arm to purchase a few more. I love them. And I’m really sad I can’t buy more :(
We LOVE you always Tati & trust your honesty and integrity forever 💖
I got so excited, then so sad.
Well this just s*cks.  I am so sorry this has happened to you and your family.   I still have my Vol. 1 and a stock of Blendifuls.  Someday I hope to have the opportunity to purchase more make-up from your brand.  Peace is important.  Thank you for sharing.  *Hugs*
I really hope that when Tati Beauty comes back, you keep the same palette size. I traveled with my Textured Neutrals Vol. 1 to so many conferences for work and it packed so well.
I am so glad I bought it during your launch.  I was waiting to buy my second one when I was close hitting pan.   Loved your pallet and wish things could have turned out better for you and your band.
Oh ..hearing we almost had a cool neutral tati palette makes me sad. How beautiful it would have been
if you would to release that pallet I would totally buy it. it's such a beautiful pallet
Tati, you look so beautiful and HAPPY! Sending you lots of love and good vibes 💕
Tati could be a duchess with her gorgeous hair
HYPE!! I LOVE YOU TATI!
Well you look gorgeous!
we need more TX vlogs 😉
Im so sad that I couldn’t buy the 1st palette 😞 I hope you start another make up brand 🤞
Wait, I obviously missed this. WELCOME TO TEXAS! I hope you love it here. I’m in San Antonio ♥️❤️♥️
I love you Tati! You are a beautiful lady inside and out!
Hopefully one day I'll be right here waiting if and when you do. I snagged the 1st pallette and can't wait to see what else is to come.
You look amazing! Loving the darker hair and your skin and complexion are flawless 💗
I really good Tati beauty comes back is buy every product 🥺
Thank you Tati for the information,  it was very informative and I enjoy your chats immensely.   I will never buy your products unless they come approved from you to a reputable beauty dealer.  You are amazing and I can't wait until you're released from all this legal bs and you can open your wings and fly and be on the top where you belong.  I love you hun, most of all I believe in you and I'm old enough to be your mom lol.  Xoxo 😘
Literally this morning I grabbed my vol 1 out of my pile of pallets and thought hmmm I wonder if vol 2 will ever happen?!?! I will admit Vol 1 is under rated. Ive used it more since December than any other pallet. I do full glam eyes daily so I use A LOT
The palette is reminiscent of the flower beauty jungle lights
I have the tan vol 1, and while I don’t really use the colours anymore, the mirror is amazing! I know that’s a weird thing to say but it’s honestly the best mirror I’ve ever gotten in a palette!!
Colors truly are...whether in home, clothes or makeup, are a sign of the times. They change to keep the economy and creativity flowing.  20 years prior?  We laugh, 20 years later?  We will laugh at today's design.
EEEEEEEP
I'm so tired of the assholes/bullies winning. Glad you're fighting back.
I love my pallet 🦋
You're so strong and thank you so much for being YOU!  Also, I refuse to believe that you won't ever be creating make-up again! I bought every Tati Beauty product and only use my Textured Neutrals pallet on special occasions. We need more of your products 😍 obviously, when the time is right for you. Because I believe that you will one day be back in the color cosmetics world!
I feel like you are almost starting from scratch. Its heartbreaking that your "pre-product" has been stolen.
Dear Tati, you truly are a beautiful soul to share this, I know it can't be easy. Your ideas are so lovely because you are so lovely! <3
I really hope one day she can cone back with a beauty brand. I wanted the textured neutrals palette, never got it cause I didn’t have the money for it at the time, its sad.
I saw a few on Mercari and they were asking in the hundreds for these palettes
I’m curious on how something like this works? Do you still own the rights to the other collections you had envisioned or did they all get tied up as property of the brand?
Keep it going Tati don't you ever give up make your dreams reality 💜
Who else got hyped thinking Tati beauty was making a comeback? 😩
You should collaborate with a company you trust to release this pallet. You deserve to be paid for the work you did.
Omg I wanna cry ! 😭😭😭 I was so happy that i was able to buy your pallet and blendiful before tati beauty shut down ! I hope you are able to flourish one day and are able to create again ! Xoxo ❤️😘
Tati, I'm so sad I missed the original pallet. When you create in the future, I will buy it without a second thought
Volume 1 is still one of my favorites palettes💜💜 you’re amazing creating makeup
You look so beautiful. Hair, make up and attitude. Keep holding your head high. You are doing amazing.
I would LOVE if you decide to make a new version of the Tati volume 2 for the cool tones. I have your first palette and I am not a warm tone person but the colors are amazing and I still try to incorporate them in
I'm really grateful you made this video. I would never knowingly purchase a stolen / pirated product. Thank you! Congrats on Texas.
Tati you are classy woman goals! This was so professional and beautifully said! Good for you for speaking your side. We love you❤️
Love you so much.
Oh my, it was certainly on the right path back then even now. I do hope the dirty thieves get their comeuppance!!
This video is weird. When were these pallets stolen? Was there any announcement made warning persons that a Tati Beauty product (prototype) was stolen so beware? Why did you purchase the product yourself? You do realise that you literally gave them your money. You could have just shown us the photos. I believe these are valid questions so pardon my curiosity.
I so wish I had bought volume 1
G-d bless you Tati. You amaze me. Personally I was holding out for a cool neutral palette. A girl can dream
i am so sorry this happened to you tati sending my support ily
Can't wait to see more makeup from you. So sorry this happen to you. Some People are bad.
Love this and love YOU! I was fortunate to buy your first palette weeks before you closed down and am so glad I did! I’m so excited to watch this new journey for you. You deserve it! ❤️
The new camera + lighting setup looks amazing Tati! The fact that this is in ur airbnb. So excited to see all the videos in the new house with all the great natural light!😍
As a supporter of Tati I am happy she cares about her supporters! I honestly had no idea about this scam but I just recently got scammed by another YouTuber and she isn’t doing anything about it. So, it’s nice to know there are YouTubers who care about their supporters. Much love and support Tati❤️
Still have my Volume 1 and my blendifuls are still the best for any makeup application!  Stay grounded my sweet friend and know karma and the universe will align when it's supposed to.   You and James continue to enjoy your new upcoming digs and focus on the things that in the big scheme of life matter which is you and him!
I still think it looks great I mean a blue-lilac (periwinkle blue) is the color of the year and a lot of people are obsessed with butterflies with the Y2k trend
This video is so unnecessary.  Why are you even talking about it.
Tati you look breathtakingly gorgeous
Your hair looks freakin beautiful 😍
Can you take a moment and talk about this lighting tho. Not sure how you feel about it tati but its giving not too bring but brings a warmth to the video
what kind of scumbags can sleep at night selling something with someone else's name on it???  Wow,  What a world,
Why do so many exist if they weren't meant to be sold?
The colors of the Enchanted Textures is really pretty...maybe someday.
I love my blendiful but for removing makeup! Its AMAZING for that. I just soak some makeup remover onto it and it takes all my makeup off like a dream. So if you bought yours and arent loving it for foundation application like me, I recommend you try it like i did👌🏼👌🏼
I miss your beauty brand I feel like james should start a beauty brand solely in his name but have u be the product creator only and call it westbrook beauty...😁 just a thought lol 😆
Go girl! You are on the road with your positivity! Best Wishes!
wow, so sorry that happened to u!!! looked and sounded like a beautiful idea! I hope u guys can get it resolved!
Tati I think you are stronger than you will ever understand. Everyone goes through difficult times but you went through some immense things in the public eye…and that is something I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. The beauty in the ashes is that this broken path led you to your savior and there’s nothing more beautiful than that!
Butterflies represent the resurrection of Christ and our transformation when we accept Jesus into our hearts.
One of my favorite quotes is, "nevertheless, she persisted". And when I hear you speak of everything you've been through, this comes to mind ❤
I really hope you come out with another beauty line. I wanted volume 1 so bad!! 😩
I’m so sorry Tati!  You will persevere I just know it!  I would never put money in the pockets of a thief!  👎🏻
We love you Tati!!!
I really hope u are coming out with another palette sometime soon!
You are the second influencer who gets her palette stolen in one month. Starting to wonder if there is inside theft.
One of my biggest regrets in life is that I didn't get a Blendiful ordered before I couldn't anymore. Anyone I see using it instantly makes me jealous. You are a quality PERSON, Tati. Through and through, there is so much quality. Your heart, your attitude, your resilience, your grace. Keep your chin up, no matter what the world does to you... you cannot be diminished. 💖
12 mins in…still waiting for Tati to get on with it 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 love u Tati
Couldn't u make a palette with a company you trust ? We would all buy it ! Lol Call it Life Renewed palette!!
It’s a shame this happened but I think it’ll push you to create even more. I always think does the truck that takes the LV bags to be destroyed really take everything to be destroyed 🤦🏾‍♀️
I still love and use my tati palette - thank you for sharing this ❤️
I’ve been in a relationship for 6 years waiting for my wedding day And have always dreamed of wearing Tati beauty vol 1 in my wedding day , I was heartbroken that when my wedding was finally approaching the palette was cancelled 😞 💔
Isn't buying stolen goods illegal?
You are an amazing woman inside and out. I’m blessed to get to know parts of you. 💙
Enchanted Textures…Oh my gosh. My heart breaks,
I hate that this happened to you!  I am a long time subscriber.  I was so happy about your brands (Halo and Tati Beauty). But more importantly is how glad I am to see you regularly again!  God has a bigger, better plan!  And His will is always for our benefit!  Jeremiah 29:11
Glad to know as if I didn’t and saw it in a Winners or Marshalls or something like that I might of bought it not knowing.
Ngl, this colour story is right up my alley. I know you have accepted and moved past what happened with your brand, but for me as a consumer I think it's a shame. I totally would have bought that palette. Anyway, you will continue to create whatever you wanna create and I wish you nothing but the best.
This makes me sad for what this brand could have been. I love my Vol 1 palette but use it sparingly because I know I'll never be able to repurchase it.
Wow.  What a shame that people stealing your ideas and launch them without your approval... and with your name on it.  It's every artists nightmare to have something taken from them before the final work is ready.  Hopefully they will arrest the thieves.
Well this sucks. I was heartbroken along with you that you shut down Tati Beauty. I would have absolutely bought the new palettes as well as the one you have shown. Good luck w/getting anyone held accountable with this all. I have my doubts. Dang it ... 😩😩 Maybe some day.
Here for your next new brand/launch and will support you for the rest of my life 💖
I saw the title and was so excited. This is so sad. I never got the first one but damn, I really wanted to when I had the money. And now that I do, it's no longer available. :(
OMG BEAUTIFUL!!! Your vision for that palette was sooooooo beautiful 😍. The colors, whoa! Lady Tati you’re so talented, you will come up with something. I’m a believer 😊
That was a lot of words, a lot of talking, without much meaning 😆🤦🏻‍♀️
What’s done is done. You look amazing, and relaxed and happier than I’ve seen for a while. Endless possibilities to come xx
I am such a ride or die Tati fan. Tati you are an incredible human being and I am so unbelievably proud of you for all you've accomplished AND overcome. I have a strong feeling that Tati Beauty isn't gone forever. You are a determined woman and no one is going to pull your dream from underneath your feet, don't give up Tati! We all love and support you! 🙌🏻👑
We love our Tati and drama channels know that blowing this up would earn our wrath 😖 You stay on track girl ! We are here for you💕
I have your palette and LOVE IT!  Tati Beauty is closed but it doesn’t mean that a new business will open! I am hopeful … and I LOVE your hair! ❤️🇨🇦😘
I’m so happy I got to purchase all of your products and still enjoy them ❤️ I really hope you get to release a cosmetic line. 😍 soooo good
I have everything you have made. If you put your name on it I’m in!
To all that are leaving CA and other destroyed places, like Seattle, vote differently than what you are used to.  Otherwise the same terrible policies will destroy the beautiful places you moved to.
Someone needs to start a kickstarter for Tati to relaunch the brand, literally my favorite palette 😓😿
I would have bought 3 of those palettes. I treasure the first one that got!
I saw that palette for sale and got excited until I found out it was not legitimate but it was beautiful. I see them selling Vol 1 for outrageous prices on Mercari. I have my original products 💕. I see other creators like Robert Welsh who still use your products and love them so much. I think it’s hard to find anyone who didn’t like them.  Here for your vlogs, love them 🥰🥰 hope you had fun in Austin 😻
i support Z in ukraine, will you lauch a Z-line of fragrance or something else? anything to show my 'not-support' for U-Grain forces (some of which happens to have same unit insignia as 2nd SS Panzer Division. how unfortunate co-incidence :O )
Awe, as always, Tati presents herself with grace and dignity! Regardless of nonsense, and drama!! I’m so sorry people have been awful, and stole from you! I’m sure this is devastating!
So so sad I couldnt get tati valume one or the blendyful and now this palette😥😥
Just from seeing this palette, the color story literally took my breath away and to know that it will never be able to be purchased is genuinely heartbreaking! 😥😥😥💜💜💜
You're the only one I still love to watch in the beauty community. I'm not gonna lie. I would like to get my hands on that pallet. 💕
I wish i had the chance to buy the Volume 1 again. I hit pan on every colour. I need it in my life again:(
It’s very heartbreaking to see other people taking advantage. Textured neutral is still my Top1 favourite eyeshadow pallete. I bring it everywhere I go. I can’t wait to see what’s next Tati! Really really love watching your videos. Sending lots of love ❤️❤️❤️ DON’T GIVE UP!
I really hope you are able to relaunch your beauty line even if it is under another name.
Besides the fact...... YOUR HAIR LOOKS INCREDIBLE!! 😍👌🔥
This is so wild, I am so sorry this happened to you :/
Tati where are your brows girl?? I know it’s hot in texas but did the melt away?
Aww Tati, hugs to you. People are so ugly! To the ones who stole it, makes me so angry.
I'm so sad that this and the second textured neutrals palette will never come out 😭
I love you girl! But damn......too much talking on this video!
I’m so proud of your strength AND your vulnerability. It’s not easy….but I’m certain GOD’s for a better plan for your life. 🙏🏻❤️
… Tati looks STUNNING 🥰 with simple, natural makeup and natural, pretty lips. She is gorgeous without face procedures. ☺️ Don’t listen to anyone who says different. Tati is relatable to all ages of ladies. 🤗 I can see how much she is loving Texas. 🌞 🌵 🏜 😉 💕
I want more blendifuls!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have the first pallet and love it. I hope you can create makeup again one day
Maybe new 2023 year palette surprise? Lol or next spring for new beginnings! Tati 2.0 I’m so ready!
I hope you eventually do another palette. I have many palettes, but yours is my favorite!
I hope you don't give up on having your own brand, because I would have purchased your enchanted palette. kisses and hugs!
This makes me so upset for you Tati I'm so sorry your still having to deal with this, but your so classy I'm proud of you Queen 👑 your amazing definitely keep being your bad A** self ... Beautiful, Amazing,Timeless, Queen 👑.. ppl take a page from this lady's book be amazing and send out positivity and love. Much love, respect, positive vibes, and intentions.
I’m gonna DM a you this.  But Tati- you should go for!  Also, I’d love for you to a coffee table book and show what each full made up.
Ugh I need vol 1
You're so pretty I can barely pay attention to what you're saying 😍
That would have been such a beautiful palette
FYI buying this pallet knowing it’s stolen can be illegal as well right?
I am from Brazil and I paid a FORTUNE to have your first palette. EVERYTIME I use it everyone compliments my makeup and wants to know where I got it. The Black IS THE BEST ONE I ever had AND I AM SO SAD it's ending!
How stupid does someone have to be to think they would get away selling it with your name on it??  You have a huge army and it would be impossible for it to not get back to you!!  Looking forward to the video saying that trash is locked up!!
omgg i wanted swatches 😭
Tati. That is beautiful. Makes me sad for what was but hopeful for the future. I will never stop watching your channel!!!  ❤️
Love you Tati!!! Your hair is amazing!!!! I’m thinking a hair tutorial is needed 😂
Wish we knew why you closed Tati beauty…I wasn’t a viewer yet so I bought one that was never opened from a reseller for 80$ and I love it
When you think people can't get any lower, they up and sell stolen palettes... I just wish I had the chance to buy the first one 😔 but I know you have a great, creative mind and that one day you'll be ready to deliver us your next great creation ❤
Um tati please like this so I know you’ve seen it… I would really really appreciate ANY dupes for your pressed glitter eyeshadows …please please please
Tati you’re inspirational! You picked yourself up and bounced back time and again.. and with such grace. ❤❤❤
I have your first palette and I enjoy it so much, I wish that Tati beauty returns somehow. As long as that would make you happy. Wishing the best for you always
Love your first palette and you so should do more palettes!!! I would so buy again!! It’s my favorite palette and you need to create more.
I wish you would open a new make up brand again… don’t let past mistakes stop you!!  Sending love and appreciation♥️
This palette popped up for sale in a Facebook beauty group that Im part of and honestly I didn't know what to think, Im just glad you addressed it because my curiosity was killing me
Hi Tati you have become very strong with all of the things that have happened to you & it brilliant to watch you take control I’m so pleased I along with so many others that we have your no 1 palette that was voted the best palette EVER on Allie channel by the viewers that says a lot  I’m very sure in the future you will do an Evan better one than your very first take care from the Uk 🇬🇧
So sad. Fingers crossed that once the legal issues are handled, Tati can re-brand and release her visions. Textured Neutrals Vol 1 was gorgeous
I love your palette hit pan on all my glitters are gone and soothe in your palette was the first shade to hit pan on i still can't find a matte black better than your tati live and let live love you
Please please please start another makeup company.
I'm still so sad for you that this didn't work out. I LOVE my Tati Beauty pallette, still. I'm praying for you! Still here to support!! #TeamTati
Can the first palette come back? Pleaasseee
YEAHH so excited 😆I was waiting and hoping for another Tati launch 🙏😊☺😀❤❤❤❤❤
I have your first palette and the blendiful and I love them both.  Why can’t you launch more products under your halo brand or create another brand? Xxx
yay!!! so excited to watch!!👏🏽💗
By closing Tati beauty, Did you loose the intellectual property of future ideas that were just in the planning stages ?
Hi Just Sad that the outside world keeps getting in the way of all your wants and dreams. Sad for the beauty community that you bring so much too!
So sorry Tati, people are sickos out there that do stuff like this all the time.  What matters now is you’re thriving and glowing embarking onto a new chapter! 🤟🏻🤟🏻
Whatever your next creation is, I am here for it - whatever it is!
Hang in there hon.  All I can say is that people will reap what they sow.  Whether we see it or not, God does not let such things slide.  There will be a reckoning to be sure.  Hold your faith tight, it will bring you through.
I’ve hit pan on so many of my shadows from the textured neutrals palette. Super sad all this was taken from you and the world but I can’t wait to see what happens next!
This would have been so awesome
Open to a gofundme to help/support maybe another small makeup line from this queen! (only if Tati approves ofc). Eventually, would love to see and purchase Tati palettes (one could dream, right?)
I have to be honest. I paused the video when you showed the pro photos of the palette and drooled a little. It looked stunning!
Wow!! You're such a strong woman! One hell of a role model! I've watched you for the better part of 10yrs. ❤️ I only wish I could have gotten my hands on your pallet. Maybe one day you'll be able to start a new chapter 😁
Love the background!
I still use my blendiful and Tati palette often
Tati, what is the lip combo you have on? It’s really pretty.
Damn woman best revenge ever is looking drop dead gorgeous 🙂!!  You go woman.  Oh how I so wish  this was a thing.  Gorgeous ❤️❤️😺.   Happy you can just keep being you and rocking on.
My cat dropped my palette and broke the matte black 😭😭
Oh my, I would have bought that palette. It looks so pretty. So I had to call my husband (he's in the living room) and tell him the update! LOL. I know he doesn't care that much but sometimes he watches when I'm watching your channel. It's all good. Sorry to hear that. It must be a little upsetting or brings up some old wounds.
THE TEXAS vibes are awesome
I would have bought & loved that palette. All my favorite colors in one palette. Good luck Tati. You're only getting better 🥰
Wish i had gotten the first one. Looked great
Looking forward to future Tati ❤ I'm here for it!
This queen keeps coming back and I'm so here for it. Love her so much! Z
Please show us how you got that hair!!!
TATI…. Ever since I have been a little girl I have always had prophetic dreams and guess what!!!?  I dreamt last night that you were pregnant with a cute little tummy in a beautiful sundress and you were glowing!!🧸🍼 I think your time is coming soon👏🏻👏🏻. Also I can tell you that you were destined to be a creator and to teach people how to be kind to each other. You have an amazing talent and you are just getting started ♥️💜
I don’t know what happened- why did Tati Beauty shutdown  I really wanted the original palette but it was difficult to get in the UK
I still wish it was your to sell. I am sorry that you are going through this.
Love you Tati 😍 you are the most strong woman I've ever seen.
Omg.  I saw this for sale online!   I wondered if it was legit because I really wanted some Tati Beauty cosmetics!   I’m so glad I didn’t support a thief!!
Why would there be so many made if they weren’t ready to hit the market?
Please just start a new company, Glam Life,  Metamorphosis, Tati Believe, anything and keep making palettes and stuff. I still use Volume 1, which I also bought for my daughter, my cousin, friends, etc. for Christmas that year. I think people would all still want that one too. I do!
It would have been amazing if you created a look just for fun. Just saying.
Hi Tati, my apologies if this is an insensitive question and you probably won’t even see it, but when you said you love it in Texas, it made me wonder. Did you consider the political and legal landscape that exists when deciding to move there? Just an honest curious question, particularly since it is so much different than California and even Washington.
It’s SUCH a pretty palette though 😭
Bless you, sweet Tati! I’m so sorry this theft happened! I, for one drop in the universal bucket, would never purchase the stolen palette if I saw it. I have so much respect for you to make it a no go besides the fact I wouldn’t ever knowingly purchase any stolen item. I hope and pray the thieves are caught and given their due diligence. I’m so glad you still love it here it Texas/Dallas area! I’ve been here since my family moved from NJ to Richardson in 1956 ❤️
It's a shame to see that your prototype palette never got to be fully constructed in it's complete form. To have it stolen on top of that?? If justice doesn't prevail, mother nature & karma will reap what the thieves will sow.
I recently bought a well known favorite product from a link on YouTube (not this channel) to Amazon that ended up being a fake when I received it. Amazon refunded me and it was no real problem, but  I’m now a bit leery of buying any brand name products where I can’t verify the authenticity. I worry not only that it could be fake but that the product wasn’t handled correctly, like you mentioned. Can’t wait to see what you create in the future! Lovin’ your Texas vibe!
Tati- please make cosmetics.  Not tools or puffs.  Do quads/8pan palettes that we can make what what we want.  Please!
I love who you are now! I see that sparkle!!!! Keep going Tati!
Tati God definitely had and does have a plan for you and he didn't want you to launch that collection for whatever reason...so praise God that it didn't happen and whoever did steal it justice will be served even if it's not on this side of living. Love you tati!
Hallo, Hugs. Sorry must be gut retching to see your baby squashed and your world upside down. Then to see a part of what you were working on appear and you are unable to stop the pressing immediately , the culprits found and product removed. Hugs and kudos for keeping your head up and going forward. Much love and thank you for a great channel of fun and tips.
I love you and will always support you and Shame on these thieves 😡😡😡. Thanks for sharing this video 🥰🥰👋👋💋👋🐾🐾👋💋s to ya'll 💋.
amazing set up! love it you look stunning
I have thee best of hope for You Tati I'll still be waiting patiently for when you officially start creating loves you girl ✨
Oh Tati, how awful! I know anything you create/put our, is going to be amazing! So excited to see what’s in store for you next! We’re with you all the way! Sending lots of love❤️❤️
Let me just say— WOW, Tati! Today’s makeup and hair is out of this world. Absolutely phenomenal 🤩
I hope and pray you make more makeup again. I love the volume concept and I love your artistry and I love my vol 1 palette so much. Thanks for sharing this story with us 😊
We are all literally waiting patiently for your NEW makeup line to become a reality. ⏰😘
WOW 🥺 man I wish this palette would've made it to us! It's gorgeous!!! 🥰
❤️❤️🪷❤️❤️
Oh my goodness... What surgery has tati had?
Sorry this happened to you! The palette looked great. I especially love the purple.
Omg you look so beautiful Tati!!! Also the video quality looks amazing! :)
OMGGGG
I love the background!
I am so sad I didn't get the palette from you! I was going to wait til my bday & then I found out it was gone & I was so upset..I  know it's just makeup but for real I was broken hearted 😭
I clicked so fast..  love you Tati
So sorry this has happened to you Tati! You have a huge group of people that love and support you no matter what. ❤️❤️❤️
💛🌼🌞🙂
Hopefully one day you'll be restart your makeup line! 💖
Ugh I'm so so upset you're not making color cosmetics anymore. I hope one day you'll be able to do it again (if you want to of course)!
I wish this had launched 🥰
❤️❤️❤️✌️
11:46  Nuff said.
Yeah, I don't think everybody is like that one YouTuber ! Thank God!
I just don’t get how Jaclyn still has a line but Tati beauty is gone.
Tati looks absolutely stunning ❤
Wasn’t able to buy the first one, but I am deff going to make sure I get this one😍!! Please make more of volume 1!!
That is a gorgeous palette and I totally would have bought it and the cool toned one totally unseen. 😂
Tati your makeup is🌹🔥🔥🔥 absolutely beautiful 🌹❤️. This is the First I'm hearing about your stolen palette.. and I'm glad it's from your. Hey Tatum have your meet maybe your neighbor.. Angelica Nyquist.. she now lives in Texas too🥰👍. I so sad still about your Cosmetics Co having to say bye bye 😭😭😭.
I would have bought it in a heartbeat 💔😢 I kept trying to get your original and just couldn't get it
I still have the Vol 1 and tempted to dip into it once in awhile but scared that its expired. I bought it when it came out. Is anyone still using theirs? Mine still looks brand new.
i wish i bought the products when they were still around :(((( one of my biggest rat brain mistakes.... Keep creating tati, we love u!!
I'm so sorry this was stolen, it would have been so pretty. You are such a great product creator. Several channels asked people to vote on their favourite ever palette and yours won each time because it is so beautiful to use I love mine so much. I treat my blendifuls so carefully as I never want to be without them. I think you were born to create and you know make-up so well, so I hope one day you can launch another company and give it another go as I have no doubt it would be a huge success.
I didn’t even know that this was a thing haha. But thank you for explaining it so well. My Tati Beauty palette was the best palette I had owned and I truly loved it. I hope you do make makeup again but if you don’t, your presence on YouTube is still so refreshing.
I am so proud at the way you talk about Tati Beauty. Not everyone would handle this the way you have. ❤️
🥺❤️❤️❤️ im just glad to have you back Tati and your channel is even better than before
Would love for you to write a book😊❤
Hi Tati!! Happy week for you
Tati, you are my OG fave, I wish you nothing but the absolute most success. I know when u get back on the horse to create and launch products you will pick right back up where you left off and take off like a rocket. My Tati palette even being expired is still my all time favorite. U are amazing. I pray for positivity & all the success & peace for you and ur family. Much love! 😘😘
Oh Tati, this sucks that someone stole this from you, even if it’s not the final approved palette.  We love you.  People are so greedy and profiting off someone else’s name and efforts.  The gall of these people is just infuriating.  I hope the police catch these thieves.
You look amazing, Tati!! I'm so sorry about what has happened regarding your 2nd palette and all that went with it. You definitely have it in you to create something new and make it yours. We've all seen you do it before! You're beautiful and amazing!! 😍
loverly to see you you look amazing my love and really happy on wards and up wards xx
Tati, I don’t think I’ve ever seen ANYONE make such a complete transformation in such a short amount of time. The difference between Seattle Tati and Texas Tati is like night and day. Everything about you now says healthy, happy, confident, and ready to take on the world. I couldn’t be happier for you! ❤️
Tati, Even though this palette didn't make it, you are such a creative, authentic & beautiful brand owner and person. I hope you do create some form of Tati Beauty again(I waited on buying my blendable!!! Darn it!). I've helped launch a few big brands and I'm very proud of you. For all of the craziness, you look like you have really found your happiness with your and Jame's new life in Texas! I couldn't be happier or wish you all good things. I hope you always follow your heart...and this palette was truly GORGEOUS!✌💐💪🌟❤
I’m actually sadder knowing volume two was gonna be cool neutrals. They are my absolute fav, I would have eaten that up..
How are you enjoying Texas?
I would have totally bought it. Sad you were not able to put it out legitimately.
Can u still buy the poof
Were these palettes literally stolen off a truck? Or was that just a figure of speech? Either way, this sucks and I’m sorry you had to go through this.
I am so sorry you were robbed of the opportunity to share your vision with us in your words. You are a visionary that has taught people to dream through their vision, words and ideas and I know you will continue to create and inspire in your own way. Love and light to you always.
Tati your a strong woman and your heart is in the right place, it takes a very strong person to go through what you’ve gone through and have it plastered all over YouTube by those Drama channels which I never watch by the way, I still Love and use your one and only eyeshadow palette and Blendiful that I purchased when they were first released, your story isn’t over yet that’s for sure, whether it be makeup or something even more special, I know in my heart that you deserve it all for what you’ve been through both You and James. Wishing You Both a Blessed and Happy chapter in your lives now that you’ve moved, new beginnings are always the Best. Cheers from Queensland Australia 🇦🇺💙💖
Tati that hair color is everything on you I love it
People just gotta steal someone’s success. It’s really ugly. I think the finished product would’ve been gorgeous. I’m sorry you’re going through all this.
It makes me sad because the pallet is beautiful and knowing the quality of your first pallet it would have been amazing to have this in my collection from YOUR Brand!! 💔
So will Tati never be able to have a cosmetic brand again? Like she can't relaunch under another name? I guess the first pallet can't be remade and sold bc of legal reasons but I'd like to see more make up from get if possible.
Just emailed you a listing! I’m so sorry Tati. I’m also crushed this never came out. My heart hurts because the first palette is my absolute favorite 😭♥️♥️
This is such a different video. This is a reveal non reveal at the same time
Wow this is all so crazy! I wish You got to release it back then even though You've moved on by now. Love u Tati ❤️
I haven't heard anything about a never released palette of yours that people are selling. I hope that they find out who's behind this and you get closure and justice.
This new setup, lighting and all is just gorgeous. It has like a cinematic quality to it.
I would’ve loved to purchase this pallete, but everything happens for a reason Tati. Everything will turn out better for you, stay strong and brave!
yeah ima need that "other reccomendation" videos coz girl! those greens!!!!!! this would have sold all the way out.
Can not wait to see what the future holds! I am here for the ride! 😎💪
I am excited to see what Tati launches next. I am sad that this palette never made it to consumers, but I am hoping all the legal stuff is over soon so she can get back to creating products. I have to say her palette is my favorite. The quality was something I had not seen, and the fact she put so much into it made me appreciate it and want to support anything she releases. While most brands were catering to the prominent influencers, she catered to everyone. I loved it; her first launch promoted smaller influencers and was for her community. Tati, you are a creative genius; we will be here when you are ready to release something new.
Thank you for clarifying all this. Really Tati! I found several Vol. 1 Pallets for sale on different online sites. I sent those companies direct emails asking about the validity of these items. Like, for FULL transparency about whether they are infact "authentic" specially consistent they are being sold for $50 or so. In comparison to your actual Vol.1 pallets being resold on eBay for over $100!!! These emails were sent over 3 months ago...I still have had a single response from ANY of those companies. Which speaks volumes,no pun intended. But their silence tells me that they are shady at least, and stolen at worst. So, I missed the Tati Beauty Train...sorry. but I look forward to seeing what you create in the future.
It’s heartbreaking that this palette was stolen but also that it was never able to launch because I want it SO bad!
Will forever regret not being able to get Textured Neutrals Vol 2 as Vol 1 was perfection, just that little bit too warm for me. ✨
Man I really hope that Tati gets to launch her own beauty brand again
🙏🏼💜🌻🌻🌻✌🏻
You are amazing! So resilient and an inspiration, so calm and collected!
Yes maaam love Texas!
Never clicked so fast
Waiting ………
I am so happy to see a little bit more of your creativity, even though I cannot buy it and even though you wouldn’t do it the same now, it’s still stunning. I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE WHAT YOU WILL RELEASE SOMEDAY(soon hopefully 🤞🏻) and please please please let it be makeup🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 you are soo good at making it. I’m already putting money aside to buy it asap when you anounce 🥰🥰🥰. Sending you lots of love, hugs, prayers and I hope this palette theft will be resolved soon.
Did you see where people rated your pallet the best pallet of all time on Ali Glines video?
So sad that it never made it to us. If you brought Tati Beauty back I would buy every launch.
Volume one is the only palette i've kept. I'm actively mourning the loss of what could have been. :( hope you make more in the future. Ps: you look beautiful, as always
I know a girl that bought one of those palletes off of mercari and there was a huge debate between everyone about whether it was real or not.  Knowing now that it was intended to be part of your brand I feel so bad that this is happening.
A question I have. Will you ever be bringing makeup to Halo Beauty?
Amen
I truly hope you can get back into having a makeup line. I love your first palette and planned on owning every palette you would make. I would’ve loved this palette!
😘
Heartbroken we won’t ever see or have your true plan and vision for this product. Your textured neutrals pallet is one of those things that I splurged on at a time that I couldn’t really afford it but I NEEDED it and I’ll never regret it it’s one of the most amazing pallets I’ll ever have and I’m afraid of using it too often and hitting pan lol. I still will hope and wish we will see you produce more makeup in the future. I was heartbroken when you announced the end of your makeup line.
Dang I can’t believe people are so greedy where they steal and sell someone else’s products! I’m soo sorry this happened to you! I’m so happy to see a new Tati Beauty eyeshadow palette!! So beautiful!!
You will forever have my support and I personally think the pallet was beautiful, I can see that representing a butterfly completely. It will happen again, I know it will, you are too talented for it not to. Thank you for sharing such a hard thing that happened in your life.
I was not aware. I'm sorry Tati. Thanks for updating
Thank you for having the courage and strength to address this! I consider your palette my every day go to palette and was and am still so sad Tati Beauty had to close. I can't image how much heart break you must feel having this stolen from you and again thank you for sharing what may have been! Cheers Tati! I've been here since 2014 (since my Freshman year in college) and I will continue to support you in whatever you decide to do! XOXO
We freaking love you over here in Greece, Tati !!!!!!!!
I'm loving this new and happier Tati! ❤
I’m keeping u prayed up for sure….!!! It broke my heart seeing this happen to you….!!! BUT GOD REMOVES SOMETHING….!!! HE ALWAYS ALWAYS REPLACE IT WITH EVEN BETTER😉 I’ve been praying for you from the beginning of all this madness bcuz that the exact time all my own started in which was a horrific situation I endured. I’m pretty excited to see u RE BLOOM…!!!! I’m claiming it for u TATI beauty will relaunch and Do amazing things….!!!! 🙏🏾 I would have loved to have this palette those PURPLES & GREENS 😱 anything u touch turns to gold………….
I’m so happy that you’re doing so well. Please tell me you’ll be making the Blendiful again 🤞🏻🤞🏻 best purchase ever!
I love you so much Tati ❌⭕️  I’m sorry you have to go through all this BS!   You don’t deserve it at all.    I pray for you, James and Puka every night. I think I’m going to step it up to a couple times a day.   You are so strong!  You’re handling this like the classy person you are.
Horrible that this merchandise was stolen. So proud of how you're handling it all and excited to continue supporting with YoTube, Halo, and whatever is in the future! 💗
You are a blessing!  💖  I'm grateful for your videos, that I often watch when I'm in bed in pain, or at the hospital.  You've blessed me, and educated me in so many ways.  ❤ 🎨 ❤  And while we have never met, I count you as a dear friend, and want the best for you. ❤
GO GIRL GO !!!! Much Love !!!!
First, WOW your hair!, Second PLEASE for the love of God list your jewelry!!!!!  Cheap, expensive, who cares, I LOVE Your taste and would LOVE for you to simply list!!!!!!!!!
Still reach for my neutrals vol 1 all the time. What could have been makes me sad.
Omg Tati please find the way to make another palette !! 🙏🏻🙏🏻 I have hundred of palettes but yours is my favorite 💕
Your so amazing! Keep going and keep you’re head up.
Your energy is amazing. I’ve been going through it but you’re resiliency is beautiful. Keep pushing through
I hope you find out who did this because i would feel violated to have something you started to create taken and sold hoping that because your name is on it and so many of us love you that they would make a killing. Speaks to the kind of human beings they are. Glad you spoke your truth you are an amazing person with such class and grace. I was saving up to get the first Tati pallet and was never able to get it and now i wont buy it because people are price gouging off your name and i just can't stand that but i hope in the future you create more so i can finally buy something (aside from the blendiful which i bought)
My Tati Beauty palette is my absolute favorite 💕
This is just sad!! Im happy you’re happy but damn!! I love the palette. I’ll hold on to y neutrals!
Tati your Vol. 1 is the best palette ever!! My sister and I are fighting over who gets it when we move out! I don’t know what I’m gonna do without it😢
I'm still ready and excited to consume Tati cosmetics in the future. 😭💔🤞
I still use my pallet everyday!!!!
It’s stunning, but no unless I knew it was coming from You , No way am I supporting thugs ! Now can I ask if someone does see it somewhere ( is it a situation one can call a number to report ?)
I don't know why I have it in my head that tik toc where they say  *I cus a little do you* lmao!
When Tati said she has moved on from the whole Butterfly vibe it truly makes me think that James Charles launching his butterfly merch completely disgusted Tati. It was the same exact butterfly (🦋 this one) that Tati ended all of her posts and tweets ect. James doesn't have an authentic bone in his body. He literally steals every idea from other people. There's so so much proof of it. 😭 I'm glad Tati doesn't deal with him anymore.
It's really too bad this has happened to Tati Beauty but I know you will do something wonderful in the future!!
I would love to see you create products again! That pallete would have been beautiful! Can't wait to see what the future holds! ❤️
Whyyyyyy Tati ugh!! I want it so bad!! Please make Tati beauty again!
Omg you look flawless!! Let us know what products you are using 🥰🥰🥰
I admire you Tati! Thanks for sharing this with us🌸
How I would love for a brand you love were to collab with you and create another masterpiece for those of us who wanted more of what you had/have planned. Not sure if that would be something you would explore. I try not to use my palette too much because unfortunately when it’s gone it will be gone for good.
7:16 looks like a glitch in the matrix haha
I saw this on Twitter, and assumed it was some type of scam. The product looked stunning, but I knew something was wrong. Never dreamed it was stolen product. You are right to stand up for your name! ♥️
So I would like to know what kind of palette you would create in our post COVID world…or if you would consider something else entirely?
Never clicked so fast in my life. I am so sad that you have to relive your traumatic experience of closing your brand over and over again. But I will not stop admiring your professionalism, grace and sense of dignity. The fact that you are not only concerned about the product not being at its finest quality but that you cannot guarantee safe storaging, handling or delivery makes me speechless. Congratulations on yet another gracious landing in the face of turbulence. Stay strong and keep minding your own beeswax. You are doing great and will keep making amazing things.
To this day , I still get compliments on the texture neutral vol1 glitters on my eyes & can't wait for the cool tones to come out hopefully some dat
Legally I could understand being hesitant to post this video but I think this will do so much more good . People need to know it’s stolen. Sending you all the love and support during all that you’re going through ❤️
I really hope you will get back to creating makeup soon!!! ❤
I love your first palette so much! It is the only one that doesn't go patchy on my eyes. I love the pink color and I wear it all the time. I will cherish it till it runs out thank you for making it!!
At first I was like “say what?” But now I understand! Tati it is crazy to see you talk about your mindset from 2020 and your version of yourself seen as the butterfly was broken. Kinda makes me sad, but also it’s good to see the new strong version of that butterfly that has grown into something different..maybe even less fragile..if I can say that? Anyway, good for you, darlin. Looking forward to seeing what you create♥️
fyi head to 13min mark to see the palette
Aside from the palette, you look so youthful and relaxed. Overall happy! I hope you are enjoying your new home!  From, A fellow Texan 🤠
so so so so sad for you.. and for me I want all your pallet ideas. I am still rooting for you! <3
I feel like you should just come out with Tati Beauty 2 and all of us will support you and sell you out on day one. The world is changing for the better for you so pls continue sharing your joy with us, plus anything you create we will stand behind you 💯 ♥️
Okay 7 minutes in and your still explaining. Come on !!! 😂
Proud of you for maintaining your peace. Sorry this was so public for you 😔
Love it hun
Thank you for teaching us all how to rebound from life’s difficult situations with grace and poise. I hope and pray you will continue on your creative journey. 💖
sis  the 8 min intros need to go WE NEED TO GET TO THE POINT but ily
I’m sorry Tati, that super stinks! I’ll always support your artistic endeavors ❤ I wish you luck on whatever your future holds.
I’m so so sad we will never get a chance to get it 😭😭😭
Seeing into a little bit of your mind is so beautiful- I love hearing you talk about creative dreams you have and you definitely deserve your storybook ending🤍
I would have eaten this up on 2019. It's amazing how much we all have changed in 2 years. Still love my vol..1
Love the positivity of this video! Thank you for sharing 😊💙💜
I was desperately waiting for a cool toned TN2. This enchanted textures palette is gorgeous, and I'm so sad things ended as they did.
I was watching Worst cooks in America-Celeb edition which debuted last night. The actress, Elise Donovan, who played Amber in the film Clueless reminded me of you! She was so sweet and genuine and down to earth and was giving me Tati vibes!
I just randomly found her channel in my recommendation now i'm obsessed with her videos she's so freaking talented.♥️🍡💗💕🍨🎂🥰💖🍧🍭💘🥳🎡.💖🎉✨🎂💞🎠🎠🧁🥰♥️🫂😍🍓❤️😍🤭💗🎉
you have every right to defend yourself your name your reputation. Wow some people just are cruel.  How do you steal from someone. Well Tati don’t worry.  i know you have other bigger ideas in the works.  Be proud
Ughhhh bummer!
This is why I treat your neutrals Palette like it's gold 🙏🙌
I wish one day you'll be able to create more eyeshadow palettes, you are very creative.
I don’t know the ins and outs of the “drama” that happened with the partners, but I will say it’s so sad that you can’t retain your brand name for the future. Also if there is a non-compete, I hope it’s a short time. Keep moving, keep creating, and butterflies are beautiful always. Thank you Tati.
I’m so heartbroken!!!! I wish I got another volume 1 palette before she announced. It’s my favourite
I wondered why the textured neutrals were so warm toned. It makes since now. I prefer cool/neutral tones so that's a bummer we didn't get to see a cool palette from you. I'll forever cherish my tati palette but I don't use it as much as I'd like bc it's too warm toned.
It's beautiful, Tati! I love seeing your idea but I hate you're having to deal with this drama of it being stolen. You're handling it amazingly. Sending you so much love!!
Just wanted to leave a comment sending Love and encourage you everything God has planned for you and your Husband.🤍💛 Texas is looking Good on you!!!💋
Go you for posting this, I am absolutely gutted for you (and me) that Tati Beauty is no more. The neutrals pallet is my go to, I use it every single day. I have the blendiful and the mini which I adore. I am here for whatever you create going forward, even if it isn’t make up. I love you and your soul and I am so happy to see happiness radiating out of you again. Sending you all the love always xxxxx
I really wish you could catch a break Tati!
I’m sorry your going through all this!
That palette is beautiful! I love the green! 💚😩
Having stuff like this happen is really just so hurtful. It takes a lot of strength to move forward and say “I can do it again”. For me it was having my lifestyle and potential future be ripped away. I can do it again, it’ll be different but just as good. So can you :)
Thank you for sharing x
You're so resilient, and it's honorable!!! You look so happy. Even though this is such a hard and difficult situation, you're smiling, and your happiness is beaming through you even discussing this awful topic. It says a lot about where you are and how happy you are, which is truly amazing ❤️❤️❤️ You deserve it🥳🥳🎊🎊
Tati, I can’t wait to see what you come up with. I love love my Tati Pallet but it’s ready for a brother or sister 😊. I can’t wait to see what your brilliant mind comes up with next…..I’m already excited for it. 😊
Loved this Tati!
Textured Neutrals 2 sounded amazing. So sad we never got to see that. So sorry this has happened
I would still buy it till this day!!!!! I love your glitters!!!!
Stay strong Tati!! Sucks someone is trying to profit.
Thank you for talking about this! Glad you made the decision to set the record straight and defend your reputation. You go girl!!! Can't wait for your creative inspiration to become a new jewel in your crown cuz you are still a Queen! 👑 Love you and take care. Kisses to Pooka!
Oh Tati. Sending 💕
My only eyeshadow pallet is yours . I sure it hurts to see when someone has stolen all your hard work. I can’t wait to see  what’s next for you as it will be even more amazing
Wow! I was so excited at the beginning! TBH I wish we could legally purchase the palette.  We love you and look forward to your future Beaty endeavors. Without a doubt it will be a smashing success!!!
Omg 😆😆😆 I have never clicked so fast 💨 I freaking love you 💜
Oh my what a hard video to share! I keep hoping Tati Beauty will return as the first palette was absolutely stunning (and all subsequent palettes are compared to it). Chin up. Better is to come!
its beautiful i wouldve purchased it n i think rich lux mentioned this in one of his videos
I SO wish none of the crap happened to you because I would have loved to get that pallet but out of respect for you, I would never buy it.
💕
Proud of you !!!
I actually liked that palette 🎨
Is there any chance that Tati Beauty would come back??
Thank you so much for bringing this up, have I seen your name on a palette I would have buy it because of how much I love you! So sorry people are gross and took advantage of merchandise that you had to part ways with!   Anyways, I am so happy to see you happy in Texas! Xoxo you deserve all good things to come your way!
As someone who has lived in Texas my entire life, I'm so surprised you like it (or anyone who moves here for that matter) lol. Glad it's going well though!
As usual, love the transparency! It must be very difficult for you to see your work stolen like this :( Love you Tati, take care
sorry you had this opportunity take away from you Tati.  hope the police gets who stole these products
Heavy heart Tati.  I sure wish you could create again.  I LOVED your first palette and looking at your second I would have LOVED that one as well.
I still would buy that palette today. It looks so beautiful. Hopefully one day. We get chance to see something just as beautiful. 😔😔 that is just shameful that it got stolen. 🥺🥺
I’m so sorry!  It’s like it’s been stolen from you twice over!  It’s beautiful and a testimony to your talent.  If you are ever able to revisit creating color products, I know everyone who loves you and your channel will be behind you 100%!  Take heart!  God has great things for you ahead!  Rest in His timing and sovereignty! ❤️
Just know whenever you decide to create again we are all here for it
I was actually lucky enough to get the Blendiful und your Palette a few days before you closed the store! 😂☠️😭 I love the palette so much!
Going to wear textured neutrals tomorrow just because 💜
I’m so happy with my halo beauty kiwi supplement. Please don’t stop making it 🌶🌶🔥
I fucking love you Tati
I would give my right kidney for the Volume 1 Tati palette. I can't even believe I slept on that! Horrible timing doing a no buy. 🤦‍♀️
I pray you colide into an opportunity that is perfect for you in this season. I pray your husband and family cheer you on in your future endeavors. Your subscribers support you.
We are dying for tati beauty again one day. ❤️ You are so strong with all you have been through and still stayed so professional during it all.
I’m so sorry this happened, Tati. I hope you’re able to find who did this to you.  Kudos to you for addressing it. I will hold my Textured Neutrals pallette close to my heart always. 💚
Holy wow its gorgeous though. I'd buy it in a second if I could(from you obviously) the color story is gorgeous.
So thankful I have your original palette. 💖
Tati, I'm so sorry you went through all this and are still going through it. I love the Textured Neutrals palette and the Blendiful, I hope someday you are able to build a beautiful brand again! I appreciate your videos soooo much. I had a horrible year last year as well for very different reasons, and I'm thankful that you came back to YouTube and are making videos again because they cheer me up so much. Thank you for always being honest and positive! 💜
You are so strong & resiliant! Seeing something you created be stolen from you like that is so difficult. But I still love and use my Textured Neutrals palette and am so excited to focus on whats ahead for you rather than whats behind!
We love Tati !!! I love my Textured Neutrals palette and would DIE for a colorful version
Omg Tati this was such a beautiful color concept!💗All of those colorful glitters up top have me in aww!! ✨ You sold me the Fantasy!! 🤩
🙂😀💪🏼🤙🏼🙌🏼👍🏼👏🏼☺️😎👌🏼
Wait? Someone help… why can’t Tati start a new brand and get creating more stuff? Her palette is literally the ONLY shadow I use. I need more
I missed out on the first and I often wished I had it 😕 out really looked like the perfect palette. This one looked like it would have been so beautiful and so fun to play with. I'm so glad you didn't let this set you back in so proud you've come so far. Bless you girl❤
I'm so sorry this happened to you! You handled this with such grace.  Post covid we are all trying to figure out who we really are. You are not alone. Thank you for sharing so I don't buy this!
I am so sad for you that you didn't get to continue that chapter and in so sad that I missed out on the textured vol 1 palette, but it is so amazing seeing you so positive right now! Part of me hopes that you've already got something in the works and can't say due to legal reasons, either way will support you!
The government is awful attacking women blaming other innocent shoppers. Wtf. Police need to be defunded. I wish I lived in another country.
So sorry this happened to you! ❤️❤️❤️
DON’T BUY THIS PALLETTE. IT HAS BEEN STOLEN FROM TATI. DON’T LET THE THIEFS WIN. ❌❌🚫🚫🚫🚫❌❌❌❌❌🚫🚫🚫❌❌❌🚫🚫❌❌❌❌
I would have bought that pallet. I haven't used my Volume 1....was just wanting to get all your pallets. So sad you aren't making more. You are awesome. I love your videos. Keep staying positive
<3
What happened with your brand is so sad! I just know that with your knowledge anything you would have created would have been incredible. And I’m so glad I got the first palette. I genuinely think the beauty community was robbed of an amazing brand and I’m praying this is not the end. I’m so sad this palette didn’t make it and what is happening is so gross! Keeping my fingers crossed For you x
I remember seeing this for sale somewhere. It's not available now. There were so many people standing up for you Tati, and making sure no one purchased it. You have amazing supporters, and we love you so much❤️
A shame, BUT you have grown SO much since that point in your life, and you are happy, and healthy and I'm more glad to have you here on youtube than I would have been to have that (admittedly stunning) Tati Beauty palette. Only love from over here x
I really hope the brand will come back one day. Still dearly holding on to my palette 💗
So sorry that this is happening to you, just a question: why were there so many produced if it’s not the finished product?
Truly devastating that we never got to see the cooler toned Textured Volumes II palette. I’m holding out hope for the future that it might be reimagined one day <3
Your work and creativity is truly impressive! 😍 So sad your idea was stolen😩 Thanks for sharing ❤️and being so positive; you are very blessed! ❤️
Please create the textured neutrals vol. 2 palette someday. I’m still so obsessed with vol. 1. It’s my all time favorite palette and I’d love to have more of those glitters in my life! 🖤
How are we at this day & age still seeing a woman work her arse off all these years & become the top of her industry only for a man to make her lose everything? Seriously messed up!
Ughh this palette looks soo good. I wish you would've still worked on making products for tati beauty😭
Give us merch tati!!!! Give us merch please
Awwww!! Well I’m so excited for your future endeavors and will be supporting!! ❤️❤️❤️
Tati you just make my days better with your vlogs and content 💖🦋 welcome to TX btw ☺️
I’m so sorry this all got taken away from you, but I’m so excited for your new chapter and what is to come💜
Can't wait for your next creation!!!!
Wow, those colors!  What a shame 😔
But will your original palette (vol 1) be sold again? I cannot believe I missed it entirely!💗
You are a strong woman Tati and never forget that. God Bless You and i will keep praying for him to keep opening doors for you and you husband :)
Holy moly, I'm sorry this happened, Tati! It sucks when people take advantage of your hard work! But you're stronger than that and I believe you can do whatever you want in the future be cosmetic music or whatever!
Ugh I was lucky enough to get the first palette. I so wish she could have made more. She had such brilliant ideas. Much love ❤️
I hope that you’re able to continue finding peace in your journey that allows you to get back to where you left off, but leveled up ✨
I love you but I’ll be DAMNED if I EVER go back to ANY PART of the year 2020🖕🏼❤️😂
So sorry this is happening. Hope some day you can rebuild Tati Beauty some day and make all your ideas a reality
Watching this makes me wish I ordered the original palette and blendiful when they were still available.
Tati your community loves you wholeheartedly and we will follow you and we will help you rebuild and grow as a business. You’re not a quick money grab and never have been. Faithful fans will wait and encourage your business even if it doesn’t happen overnight. Sending much love from your PNW
Omg....I bet that would be such a beautiful palette like her last and only one was! I really hope and pray she does it again. I love my palette that I got when she had it back then. I didn't hear anything about this till now. I'm glad she said something. I think it's wrong that someone would still this from her. This was her dream. Love ya Tati all the way from Detroit, MI xoxo 😘 ❤ 💖
Painful…it literally took 12 minutes to get to the point
awe we are jus GRATEFUL for YOU….thanks for keeping up with us… we love you & WELCOME TO TEXAS….#georgetown
I mean I would have bought it if it had come to fruition! I do hope you’ll start a fresh make up line and maybe even skin care moving forward!
Still use my textured neutrals palette!! The mirror broke so I had to duct tape it 😂 but I will cherish it forever!
I can definitely see the butterfly inspiration in. The palette
I will absolutely be ready for your next cosmetics launch!  I love your eyeshadow palette.
This was so confusing a video.
I’m still so bummed for you that you had to shut down Tati beauty! You are one of the only people that I knew I would love every product you came out with! I hope you are able to have your own brand again someday because we all love you and want to see more products from you 😘🤗❤️🫶🏻🙏
You're very brave for doing this, Tati!  I was very lucky to get your first palette, it's such a treasure. Whatever you do in the future, I'm sure it will be a delight
you look beautiful Tati💖
❤️
Yep that purple is so Tati
So sorry you’ve had to go through this, on top of everything else. Truly hope we get to see more of your creations one day, in whatever form they take!
Tati I am so sorry that you were not able to get that palette out. I am still devastated that you closed as my birthday was coming up and I was going to finally be able to get your first palette. I just as I watched tried to find that color Palette online. I have typed all sorts of things but nothing is showing up. I hope those who stole it get what they deserve. WE LOVE YOU!
So Glad you are enjoying Texas hopefully one day I will run into you. I'm in Burleson, Texas and go to Dallas alot to see alot of my specialist doctor are in Dallas.  😘
Years ago I was getting hair extensions and my hairdresser was selling sephora brand palettes in the backroom. I was shocked! My cc was stolen and I know it was them, very shady. This stuff happens! Sorry Tati! Onward...your next move will be BIG no doubt!
I honestly hope you build a brand again. I would have bought this pallet in a heartbeat.   Don't give up on your brand dreams yet please!!
I'm so sorry this happened. People are so gross.
Sad that people are so greedy.. i really hope that your journey in creating is far from over.. You're literally the reason i started loving makeup.. and I'm thrilled to watch you again..
I admire your strength and all that you have been through and still have your head held high. Alot of admiration and respect Tati 💕
I never got to get the original palette or the blendiful. I'm desperately hoping they come back.
I WANT TATI BEAUTY BACK SO BAD IT ACTUALLY HURTS 💕💔🤍🤍
This is so tragic 😢
Love your hair ❤️❤️
It really is a beautiful palette. Sorry it never came to fruition, but am rooting for whatever you do in the future 💜
Sending you all the love 💜
How's Texas treating you? Love the new back ground by the way .....its very Texan. 😍
I so wish this could actually have come to fruition your pallette is my favorite and Im so sad I cant get more and see all the amazing things you dreamt of.  Love to you.
...but but it's so pretty! I love love LOVE your pallette.  I don't want to use it much so I don't run out lol
If every celebrity ever makes their own beauty line, YOU of all people in the universe should be able to have one!! Drives me nuts.
Makes me so sad that your dreams and visions were ripped away from you.   Here's to hoping you can create this under a new name or something!!
It's beautiful, but sad! X
Heartbroken FOR you Tati. People suck
I'm still using the Tati Beauty palette - I'm savoring it until there's nothing left 🥹
Knowing how passionate Tati is about how purple shadow looks on the eye, I know that the purple row has to be absolutely amazing tone and pigment-wise!
You seriously can not look more beautiful than you do today/now🥰💝👏 Best of Luck/wishes moving forward 💐💄
I recently hit pan on 2 of the glitters on the last pallette and I'm so sad since we can't purchase anymore 😢
I just passed my nursing exam today! I’m done after 3 years! Now a Tati video!
TATI PLEASE GIVE US ALL A BREAK. LATELY YOU'VE BEEN EXPLAINING THINGS SO LENGTHY. IMAGINE, IT TOOK U MORE THAN 14 MINS TO FINALLY OPEN THE PALETTE?! I LOVE U SO MUCH BUT I DON'T ALWAYS HAVE 20 25 MINS TO WATCH A VIDEO ABOUT MAKEUP. BUT I SUPPORT U SO I WATCH UR EVERY UPLOAD. HAY, I DON'T KNOW...
😭😭😭😭 I KNEW it wasn't true. I want it so bad. I so hope you are able to start selling your own again.
The peach tone is a dream and I want it so bad 😭
Hello Tati, I have a kind of technical question, if this was not approved how is there enough to steal? Do you mass produce to check things before fully approving a palette? Just wondering.  Love you
Is there at all any chance of being able to still get the Blendiful? That was a game changer product for me, and I hate that I can't have backups anymore.
I’m excited to see what you do!  I’m sure whatever it is, it will be amazing!
I predict a lot of people will delete comments made based on the title alone...
You’re essentially saying it was a template that you were working on!
Absolutely stunning palette, Tati. I’m still so devastated Tati beauty is no more!!! Excited to see where your journey takes you next and to support in whatever way I can. So much love ♥️♥️
Who else still loves their blendiful?
🥺😢
Please Tati! Please bring back the blendiful 😩😩😩💕💕
You had eyeshadow perfected! Please take my money lol I know going backwards probably isn’t where you are BUT if you ever start make up again, it will be so so successful again. 😘
I hate that this happened to you. Skip book 2.  I’m here for all of your others. You’re amazing, and I’ll support you! 💜
Love you Tati 😭❤️
My original Tati Beauty palette its by far my FAVORITE palette!! ❤️xo
I hope tati patented her eyeshadow formula. It is the BEST I have ever used.
Tati Texas looks amazing on you! So healthy and glowy!
She should collaborate with an established brand to recreate this and bring it to market
Brush it all off! 💕 Easier said than done for sure but you’re killing it.
Hi Tati!! 💕 so excited for your new chapter. Been through it all with you and I can say you have a supporter for life!! Your courage is unmatched. A true role model and real genuine human. More to come 💕
Please go through and produce this Tati!!! It’s gorgeous 💕💕
That’s crazy I never hear about this but I was looking to buy your old pallet on posh mark and there are some for sale I’ve seen of this pallet.
For a moment I thought you were going to open your online Tati beauty 😢 I’m so proud of you, hopefully in the future you bring it back 💖💙
Texas is the best!! We are glad to have you!
I still have my Volume 1 Tati Beauty palette, and it is a staple and I receive compliments any time I’m wearing it. Can’t beat that formula. Hopefully you can create more makeup in the future.
Tell me this is real!
Bummer.
🙏🏻💕
I LOVE the concept of enchanted textures
You look really good. I haven’t watched your videos in quite a while, but you look younger? And your hair looks fabulous.
I dream of a day when you'll start another beauty line. Your shadows are amazing!
Darn it. I want the cool toned one!!
I’m so sad that I never got to pick up your Textured Neutrals palette! I wanted it so badly, but just didn’t have the extra money at the time to buy it. If I could go back I would have made it happen somehow. When I see people using it I get so bummed that I never got my hands on it. Maybe, hopefully one day we will get to enjoy Tati Beauty again!! 💞 Edit: Were you aware it was stolen prior to it showing up and being sold? That is so sad, I hate that this happened to you Tati, ppl can be vile.
Awww so bitter sweet. Still so beautiful 💜✨🥰
❤❤❤❤❤❤
I’m sorry you can’t make this product, and I’m sorry we can’t purchase it.
I almost was like going to fall on the floor, because I miss getting the first palette well sadly the only palette that was launched! And I was like thinking that you were coming back with your brand... I hope one day that could be a possibility!!!
Texas looks good on you. There seems to be a lightness in you lately. You look happier. Even with the "drama" that clutters up your day to day.
Idk if something is different, but you look amazing. Not that you didn’t before, but you’re especially glowy.
People can be cruel, but WAY TO GO for being honest with us about it, all while keeping your peace & loving the new chapter of your life! 🥰
We love and support you! Thank you for being authentically you!
OMG my ❤️
I can’t find it anywhere!!!!
We love you Tati! Will always show up and support ❤️❤️
Thanks for sharing! I would have bought this palette. Cant wait to see what’s to come!❤️
I clicked so fastttt
It will happen when the time is perfect!!
You are glowing since moving to Texas
Ugh I would die for that color story in YOUR formula!!! I'm in LOVE!😍 and heart broken I can't get one at the same time!😭💔
Baby scandal = scandlette lol
Tati 🥰🥰🥰🥰 let’s hear what you can share!
Yes to the big girl lashes and hope this gets resolved for you Tati! 💕
Ue pallate is one of my favs
i love your pallette so much and hate knowing I'll never get refills on some of the colors 😢 but still endlessly proud and excited for you.
If it’s true I need! Need!
Your palette is my holy grail for everyday use, I was sad when I hit pan 😭
Never clicked so fast
You hair looks amazing ♡
Love the background!!!!!
Love to follow you Tati 🙏🏻❤️ love from Julie Denmark 🇩🇰
Hugs

the camera quality is so good you are glowing and i love to see it in HQ ! excited for everything to come for you !
now i am more sad 😩 wish this palette could have made it to us. but i know better things are lined up for you. i know the universe handled things in a way so you can do what you are meant to do. sending lots of love and positive energy to you tati💜
I love how honest and transparent you are, you are so deserving of your successes ❤️❤️❤️
Your palette is my TOP palette!!! I really hope that you continue the amazing work!!! I can not wait for the new product whenever you are ready to do it 🤩🤩🤩
My hats off to the drama channels as they used to be ruthless. I never heard anything about it. I wish it could of been released by you. I still adore your original palette.
I am still hoping Tati Beauty Vol I makes a come back to have the opportunity to purchase it

I clicked so fricking fast lol
Love this setup , you look beautiful tati 😩
I was immediately blown away by how good you look -you did a great job on the big girl make up!
I saw someone post on a Facebook marketplace one of your pallets and instantly knew it was fake and reported it!!! I’m so glad it was taken down! People need to get a life!
I’m wearing my Tati volume 1 today. I haven’t pulled it out for a while.
She busts out the palette @12:00
Is this the reason you shut down?
❤️
The title! Am I in heaven?
Is this for real!!!! Can’t wait 🥳🥳🥳🥳 (reacting to thumbnail)
