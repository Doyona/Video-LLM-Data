What happend to this podcast!? BRING IT BACK 😢😂
Comeeeeeee backkk
Me still waiting for the documentary 😭
When is the next one ?
Yooo when we gonna get another nopales episode 😢😢
Really enjoyed these podcasts. Should def think about bringing em back with some new topics
Hello ? Anymore videos coming soon?
Y'all for reals  12 hours in a holding cell  Mija relax  That's ain't nada
Slacking on the nopales show  upload my boy
Drop that new podcast boyyy!!
Damn, Benny said anyways on them talking about Elani
I'm sorry..not! I see only Alondra.
elsy is young n wealth she only has one child! she has all the time to find her soulmate
I SO feel Elsy! I don't see my daughter the same amount of days.  I also think daughters should be with their mothers more. It's so tough 😭 but we are strong mommas! Thank you for sharing. U guys are hella funny and beautiful.
The way Alo & Elsy both said “byeee” at the end lol so cute. I love their friendship🥰
Still waiting on that documentary 👀👀
I  think you should have a set up for this, hella nopales everywhere would look hella coo
He’s low key in love with Elsy, he even said he was following her first and alondra knows it.
Yea both of them
Where a new episode ?
EXPOSEEEEEEEEEE TIMEEEE YASS
Yes Elsy documentary 💖
I'm laaaate watching this after the Tahoe trip when elsy and Chris get pizza lol!!! Mmmmm something something mhmm
Hate that there are restraining orders involved! That just ain’t right for the baby to see. Who wanted that?!!! Wtf
Should focus on the positive and that the baby’s father is trying to be in her life and wants to have her for 5 days. That would be soooo hard for me too. Elsy should try to enjoy her free time. Cuz if she was with the dude she wouldn’t get much time away from the baby. And we all need some free time every now and then.
To the person reading this  Even though we don’t know eachother I wish you the best in what life has to offer and a blessed new year to come. You are amazing and awesome in what you do never doubt yourself.   Sincerely livewithmarie
Benny when you posting a new one? 👀
I don’t mean to come out like hate but I have one question benny! Why would you have Elsy on your show before MARIA from us always! To remind you MARIA helped You push you to blog And know you act so different like you used their kids!! For your blogs come on boy!🙄👎🏻we see all that!🤡
Yesss to the doc!!!!
to elsy: "wassup bayybee lemme take you out to dinnerr" 🌞💘
I JUST LOVE THERE FRIENDSHIP NO JEALOUSY OR BACK TALKIN ALL LOVE AND LOYALTY AND MOTIVATATING 🥰🥰 I NEED ME A FRIEND LIKE THAT
Also finally sub to the Nopal show lol
Elsy youre my hero girl you stood up for what you believe in and are facing the situation head on with your ex. Praying that you get the custody rights you deserve and spend more time with your baby. Im a silent viewer but literally love watching Alo and Elsy together god bless :)
give us the doc!!!!
You should go live on your shows and interact with your supporters and maybe answer 5 questions per video. That’ll be real cool in my opinion.
Not me thinking you were gonna say Christian Blends sponsored the video 😂
This gives me brother and sister-in-law goals 🥺💕!
Good ass episode!
I’m not too knowledgeable about family law but I don’t think Elsy has to leave Bebe for 5 days overnight until courts finalize custody At least that’s what some my friends went through Hope things work out for the best ❤️
First video I watch and omg I love it so much Elsy is such a sweetheart
ely loos so pretty wthout lashes <3 she has such pretty eyes
Elsy!!! We want Elsy documentary!!!! 😘😘
Yoy can still tell alo doesn't know how to read the baby at what he wants but God bless you girl yoy will forsure get it and look Benny gets a little worried when the phone goes off or uncomfortable when homegurl puts her legs up about to show her goodies lol
Baby Benny is so cute he's all smiling and chilln
I am been a single mom since I was 15 years old when I got pregnant and now I am 22 years old and my baby girl is 6 years with out her dad not being in her life . Single mom are the best 💓
Yesss an Elsy documentary! 😍 we love her! And tell those girls we need more dedication to the Alo&Elsy channel!! Lol
More chick fil a runs lol
I’m here for the documentary
Also yes on the documentary!!
Honestly I’m not a fan of a lot of “social media influencers” but there’s something about alondra and elsy that seems very genuine. They’re honest about the bad parts of their lives and that makes them relatable. Even BBL’s lol we all know hellla people got them these days but act like it’s from working out, not them lol. Things like that make people like them, including me! They’re funny too. Great episode, now I’m gunna watch the rest
The dior bag 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
why does Benny have a black eye ?
Elsy is such a freaking boss!! She’s definitely one to look up to, such a strong and wise mama 💗💗✨
Why am I just finding out Elsy owns ootd! I love their clothes 💗😩🥺
The documentary would be awesome because I feel like many people can relate to elsy and for the people that don’t would understand what she and most other people go through ❤️
I simply LOVE ya'll!💞 you 3 are definitely vibes...#FriendshipGoals. On a serious note, I really enjoyed this nopales show, raw and real and I loved every minute. Benny you got it 👍 your taking off with your career and your doing a fantastic job keep up the awesome work!💯👏...elsy hun, praying that everything works out for you and baby, she definitely is a happy baby, she makes me smile from ear to ear when I see her cuteness self! Alondra, your just absolutely gorgeous and I'm so happy that you and Benny found each other because ya'll belong together!!! Benny got the girl of his dreams, alondra got the man she deserves and together ya'll created a beautiful family 👪 ❤ ♥ 💕
Alo’s face when baby Benny pulls her hair🥺 lol
I hope all of this for her comes to a resolution very soon. So her and the baby can move on and just be happy and have stability  and healthy routine specially for baby E. 🙏🙏🙏💜
we love you elsy ! 💕💕💕
I remember when elsy needed a frozen speaker to talk lol (only real ones know lol)
Yeah 5 Days Away from my baby would be way to much I feel for Elsy 🥺 Good Things Come To Good People Trust Me 🙏🏻❤️
A Documentary Of Alondra To 🙌🏻
I really would love to see else’s documentary she’s a boss babe and she’s very inspiring
I have a 3 year old daughter and our bond is 100x closer then her and her dads is. She loves my husband, but she's definitely a mamas girl. I could not go 1 single day with out her let alone 5.... prayers to elsy 🥺💕
Elsy I have been following you for a very long time and I’m sad to see you go through all this and I feel your pain I been a single mom all 4 years now and it definitely gets easier and I just pray everything works out for you and your baby because you really deserve all the happiness in the world! Praying for you💙
Good video guys 👍🏼
Yes please Elsy documentary
The whole documentary thing is such a good idea I would like to watch that!!!!!!
I’m so happy y’all had her. 💕💕💕
Slick way to bring up the ootd thing lol, I would still think it’s fkd up if y’all start selling clothes too 😂😂
I would love to see Elsy documentary. I think it would be soo cool!! B/c it’s true we only get to see a glimpse of ur personal life.
Minute 4:08 The baby 🥺🥺🥺😭😭
alright you can tell Benny hasn’t been sleeping 😅 those eye bags down to his belly button
The show name is very disrespectful
yassssss ! I would def want to see Elsy’s documentary!! 💯💯
Lmaooo tell me why when you said speaking of blenders I thought you were gonna say shout out to Christian Blends
I love seeing alo with a good man and the fact that she went from her situation god took her out of to a very good relationship where she has everything & I see the same thing happening for elsy God has plans
Creating generational wealth 🥰
Benny you should talk about how u were raise without your dad at some point it will help Elsy and her baby girl 🧡🧡🧡 look how great father you are now
6th gen Texan from Dallas. 35wm - nokids but only cause my ex wouldnt.  I just bounced to BeastTX and every night I keep having dreams of meeting a legit Hispanic chick who rides horses/bulls/rodeo? Where can I find this girl? Never been my style, but God is crazy.
This is the first time I watch a show and I love the dynamic BUT the mic 🎤 kinda sucks 🥴 gonna binge watch now tho lol
Can't wait for the documentary
A documentary yessss 💓
Shiiiit y’all know we’d never mind alo back on the podcast to hear more about herrr ! We love her 💖
Y’all made sure to give elsy the microphone LMFAOOOO
you should put that editing energy you had back then to your videos now
benny is so dry he needs to drink some coffee or something
Elsy is a baddie
A 🐍
I love Elsy 🥺 she’s been through so much and she’s such a strong women ! She’s intelligent as had such a great personality! I wish nothing but the best for her and her baby ❤️
I love how I’ve watched y’all maybe since 2016 and I still see the same funny,humble, and positive people just here for a good time to make 10-15 mins for us fun! ❤️🥰 who don’t love a documentary but please please please please don’t sugar coat we want all the CHEESE! ** Benny fart noise** 😂
Elsy is a great mom , she met a loser with no future , and now she has to co parent with him , stay strong Elsy don’t let anyone tear you down, you have a great support system of great friends and family , wish you the best
I love Alondra and elsy’s friendship, they always got eachother no matter what 🥺 also, my kids father and I’s custody agreement is I have full custody but he has them 2 days out of the week and every other weekend. It took a lot for us to get to this point but 3 years later it’s all worth it!
I love how you stood up for Christ right away when she said he's not step daddy's material. You can tell you're a real friend.
Christian Blends and Elsy G. OMG I wanna see them together......THAT'LL BE THE DAY, I AM HERE FOR IT!!!!
I'm a mom and have a 7 month old baby. And of course I'm watching this at night and I keep pausing the video thinking my baby is awake until I realized it's your baby lmao
This is so boring like idk why it’s not even funny or anything lmao
Take a shot every time elsy says “I’m dead” hahahahahhahaa. Love this video.
yes do the documentaryyyy!!!!
Ima need that Elsy documentary ASAP 💳 💥💳💳💥💳💥💳💥💥
Good hearts always win. Elsy will find happiness and a good man ♥️ loved this podcast
I am praying for you elsy 🥺 praying for you momma
Elsy said she was picky with men & she still picked the wrong one lmao 🤣
She said I did not fucken belong there 😭😭😂😂I’m dead
i like all your guys vibes, real.
How many times did else die ? 😂😂😂 “I’m Deeeaaad “
You no damn well alondra left tre because she was talking to benny already😂
Yes!!!! make the video I loved Benny's moms documentary ❤
Elsy I’m step-dad material 😂 when you ready I got you and baby Ehlani 💍
Am I the villain? I don’t think I’m the villain
“I’d rather be a single mom than have my daughter in a toxic environment” -Elsy ❤️‍🔥❤️🔥

I can’t with that baby😭Gives me hella a baby fever🥺
Yes!!!! And I want to see a documentary of Alondras life
Can one of y’all pay for my sleeve, I’m trynna look like a bad bitch like both of y’all
Yes docu!!
Benny estas nalgon
THE BABY LMAO HES SO CUTE
I am here for Elsy’s docu series!!!
Baby legend staring at elsy in the beginning was too much. Looking at her like "lemme find out why this my mama best friend" 😂
i deadass just bought some sunglasses and blue light glasses with your code BENNY! I been looking for some for a long time and i had to take advantage
Honestly i didnt want to speak on this but thats false lol i love watching adventures and chill videos . Maybe drama shows but youtube videos are diff why would you want to see real life peoples life drama instead of trying to make it fun . And just having a normal conversation about diff subjects instead of drama.
We want The documentary 👀
Love all of your guys’s friendships towards each other! ☺️✨✨💝💝💝
Elsy ur such a string women ♥️keep it up girl hope u alo stay bestriends for ever I moved in with a friend too we barely knew each other she was very cool
Yessss we love slay amazing mommy her babygirl is blesssed to have a strong woman like her ❤️
Elsy is such a independent strong mommy 🤍🙏 praying for you each day
I don’t think Elsy should ever say it was her  fault
Elsy seems like the more  mature parent for her daughter  It’s not a bash against the dad. But the dad has shown he can’t keep his feelings neutral like elsy  And always has to bash her some way. And I truly believe he’s the type that would tell his daughter when she understands how to talk Why was the reason they split and “it’s your moms fault”  And I hope he doesn’t bc all he is proving is  He’s a child and he can’t handle anything
What’s the haircut name  @benny
Didn’t even know it went as far as restraining orders something must have went down 😩
Im so happy to see her getting back to her old self!❤️
all trying to dodge baby leggie’s hair pulls
Y’all are so real and down to earth Wishing y’all nothing but blessings ❤️
I can’t wait for Elsy to get a good man who deserves her
YESSS, we need a documentary of Elsy!!! Elsy has been through a lot and Elsy needs her story to be heard!!!

We love you Elsy,Alondras and Benny ❤️💗💗
Alondra and Elsy need to post more on their channel together!! I know they’re busy and have their own thing going on but I love their vibe together 💞

Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.” ‭‭Luke‬ ‭12:2-3‬ ‭KJV‬‬ hang in there elsy God got ur back🙏🏼🙌🏼♥️prayers all comes back to your favor
"I am fucking dead" lmaoo mood same
I wanna see elsy and Chris on tha nopal show lol
Damn Benny looks dead asfk . Like he’s tired .. I bet he does all the work with the baby and house work plus putting up with alo .. look at his eyes they’re all dark like he’s stressed and no sleep
When I’m in the same boat as Alondra and Elsy 😂  Started dating September 2019, engaged February 2020 and married November 2020.
It's like they don't know how to speak, especially Benny's BM....I can't anymore, so annoying ✌️
I'm exited for Elsy's documentary!!! 💯
The way alondra teleported @ 8:44 💀💀💀💀
I love this trio 🥺🤍
Train $?
Yesss Alondras pod cast and easy documentary!!!!
I love there Friendship 💗
Damm elsy does your hand hurt holding that big ass mic. Lol.. Alo gift benny some new ones..lol
This video was so weird like why didn’t he just film elsy alone? The whole time alondra has to say something to cut elsy off! I like alondra but seems like she has trust issues u can tell Benny was just off interviewing elsy alone. This would of been better without any distractions we actually want to hear elsy story but couldn’t because alondra had to say something every time Benny asked elsy a question🙄🙄
We want to see the documentary
Why does Elsy baby daddy want to fight you so bad? He’s so salty that his music career can’t take off. Forever a big baby sound cloud rapper lmao 🤣
I like Benny and this crew🙂I can’t say the same for many influencers out there.
The entire time I kept seeing their microphones like mini fans lol
Taking a picture with elsy being behind bars 🤣
Soy la 69 i am dead 🤣💀💀
Hahahah she said I am the drama 😂😂 shitttt fuck it sis keep making the mulaaaaaa 🤌
Had already seen this but came back to say, Proud of you Benny for not feeding into Elijahs bs, dudes a clown even his momma know it. You got it going for you and your little family ! Proud of you! 👏🏻
My sister and I. ***
How do you make a video pranking Benny and then forget the purpose of the video 😂 alondra has always been hella slow 🤣.
When Alondra popped in 😝 8:44
Aww Elsy. I’m sorry you’re going through this! My mom was a single mom, & would tell me I’ll understand when I get older why she left my dad. I really appreciate her strength & glad she did what was right for her & me. Ehlani will appreciate you no doubt about that ❤️
8:44 Alondra really said "yall thought I left?" She appeared out of nowhere  😂😭
Yes on doc!! Elsy stay strong you got this!
Benny seems so serious around Elsy .. I love E ‘s& A’s bound 🤎.
I love how Baby Benny is looking at Elsy. 😍
drop the video ! i want to see it haha
I’m soo excited for Elsy’s documentary I love her!
En el nombre sea de Dios que todo salga bien Elsy I really pray that you get full custody of Ehlani no te aguites we love you🙏🏼❤️
Yes we need the documentary🧏🏻‍♀️
It's definitely hard when times go to fast for you to seem and I have 2 kids and I am 23 . You go through life every person has there owe stuff that we all have work out . I try to be positive having to be involved with gov. Help it's amazing but also feel a little failer so I feel like we all have faithful lines we all can cross and get over the struggles that do come with it . Proud for all 3 of all .
NO MMS🤣🤣 i thought y’all were gonna say like $50 or nada cuz it was her bday present LMFAO. Se la jalo con $700. Te robaron
I love this podcast because they always keep it real!  Plus they're a beautiful family. ❤
I wanna see a documentary on Elsy❤️😭
Alo and Elsy are so beautiful! :)
Elsy is the only real ass females 💯 in this industry.. facts none of these big headed ass influencers will never say they cam crom e.b.t or will never admit they have to get e.b.t to feed yo kids 💯stay up girl your a beautiful woman and a good mother don't let Noone take that from you...
When alondra would disappear with the baby and come back randomly 😂
elsy is actually so beautiful. one of the prettiest girls ever <3
Has alo ever thought of Shoulder length hair? It would be gorg
Why did I think you were gonna shout out Christian when you said blend 😂😂😂 then you started talking about the sponsor.
I got arrested for a bench warrant when I was in my early 20's and I was crying in my mugshot too! 😭🤣😂😂
2 happy homes are better than 1 broken home!
I literally just started crying when I heard elsyy talk I feel so bad for what she’s going through
I’m glad it worked out for her and Alo 🥺!! I found them through that meme too!! 😅😂
Elsa you’re an inspiration! 💕 you got this girl 💪🏼
A documentary about elsy would be awesome
My daughter is 5 years old and it hurts when she says why doesn’t she have a family and it really hurts but I tell her daddy broke mommy’s heart we couldn’t be together but no matter what your family is the people that care about you and if it’s just you and me that’s fine I’ll always be here to love you and you’ll be my only baby forever ❤️ she will fully understand once she gets older and she will decide if she wants to have him in her life or not I’ll respect her choice no matter what 🙏🏼🥰
These girls are so sweet. 💕
Haha I love how they threw Christian Blends in there lmao
I feel like Elsy deserves nothing but positivity , shes on her journey of healing
I feel for elsy & all of the mothers who have have to share their baby or left to take care of the baby themselves 😞 I couldn’t imagine not having my kid with me If your baby daddy is in the picture take care of him take care of each other because it’s not easy to go through this alone. Or at least know what you’re getting yourself into
As a women I will always pray for the well being of women who have stories like Elsy , just because I know how tough it is 💕you aren't alone gorgeous and we will all get the happiness we deserve soon enough ✨
Baby ehlani needs her mommy :( her dad probably had her parents watch her
Jesus is your way to heaven Believe in him and you will have life after death. He shed his blood for your sins to be forgiven.
Jesus is your way to heaven Believe in him and you will have life after death. He shed his blood for your sins to be forgiven.
Benny has so much potential for future Projects 😍 hell yes we need an elsy documentary 🥰
4:12 i cant get over baby soliven just looking at elsy and smiling 😩❤️❤️
We are here for you elsy! I went through the same thing w my sons father & my son is now 11 yrs old and he understands things so much ❤️ he knows in a respectful way why things didn’t work out .
Yes !! Go for it “ Elsy The SToRy” 👍🏻
Just gonna love elsy
so hard for people to get our last names right haha
Else needs that mic for all her videos 😭😭😭😭😂
Elsy deserves a BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE 👏🏽 for everything she does and continues to do !!  You are an amazing mom regardless of what anyone says. Keep your head up!
i love Elsy, she seems so genuine and a real ass soul. she’s freaking hilarious too, i wish her and Ehlani nothing but the best 🤍
Can’t really hear  Elsy mid end 😩
I couldn’t stop staring at baby Legend , HES SO CUTEEEEE
The babies head is mad big 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I wouldn’t mind seeing a video about Alondra’s life… like where’s her mom? Did anything happen during her childhood? It might be triggering for her so who knows if she’ll be open to speaking about it.
Documentary !! Yes!!!!!!
Love you guys ❤️😗❤️
🥳💘💘
Do it I wanna see the documentary
I’ll tell her her dad is a bitch for you
A documentary would be fire 🔥
Love it 🥰
finally got her a real mic 🤣🤣🤣
Yes I would for sure love to watch Elsey's documentary 🙏❤️🙏
Yes Documentary
I really enjoyed this. Keep up the great work guys.
Ok i see u Benny, that u r up to something. Yes!!!! We would like to see Elsy's documentary.
The nopales name fits you all perfect 👌
This trio is so unmatched 😭😭💗💗
We want to see that blooper video 💀😂🙋🏽‍♀️
Elsy & I had the same childhood 🧍🏻‍♂️
EVERYBODY and their momma has a podcast lmfao
Wow, that makeup routines just enhances the beauty of you girls! Nice to see you girlies glowing ✨
Love you Elsy!!!
I’d love a documentary on both alp and rosy I feel like alo hasn’t really shared much of her story so I’d love to see it
When Benny said he look up Alondra’s name and other people pop up that he doesn’t want to be associated with 🤣🤣 Me: looks her up  YouTube: Landon, Austin, tre ( 🤡🤡🤡)
Benny you're a whole commercial with your Blenders advertisement 😆
The documentary will be great!! Give it two months after her final court date for custody. 😊
He just jumped into the convo, no intro or anything 🤣
This is painfully awkward
When you can actually hear Elsy for once 😂 please gift her that mic for Xmas 🤣❤️
I love the 3 of you!!! ELSY & ALONDRA bestie's for life! Benny you're funny af, but yea ya'll need to upgrade from monthly subscriptions to at least 2 weeks!! I love you all ❤❤❤ baby girl don't let that negative ishhh bring you down. Your baby girl is #1 you're an amazing mother ❤❤❤ God bless you and your beautiful baby girl
Elsy has to the strongest person I seen on social media thank you for sharing so little yet so much with what goes on with your personal life. I know as a mom it must be hell having to let go of your daughter for so many days I could only image the feeling. A baby her age shouldn’t be confused with what’s going on around her . God please I pray you continue to give elsy all the strength she needs to overcome this obstacle she’s going through and that she is granted the ability to rightfully take care & give the proper care over her sweet little girl . I hope all this end soon for her and baby e and wish her nothing but positivity ❤️
Would love love to know about Alondras parents separation and living w her dad instead of Mom
Definitely a documentary
JESUS IS LORD AND KINGS OF KINGS   Jesus loves you He die for you and arose to give you life. And still loves you even though you reject him. You beautiful, smart and important  human being 🥰❤❤🙏  Jesus loves you and forgives you for your past choices and mistakes accept him as your Lord and savior before its to late start a relationship with him read your Holy bible, talk to him every day and pray, he is waiting on you with arms stretch wide open waiting for you he would not force himself on you his a gentleman, kind,loving and PATIENCE. Put your trust in Jesus because he is the only one that will never fail You, worship him day and night , be thankful every day despite of😊  Gospel songs Nobody - casting crowns  Michael w Smith- love in his right hand  COMMUNION- TRIBL I THANK GOD - TRIBL  Voice of GOD - Dante Bowe  CHAMPION - TRIBL   There is much more but accept Jesus he loves you and he knows what's best for you, trust his timing, his ways and thoughts are higher than ours😊❤❤💞❤💌💫💫💫💫
Im here to see what Twitter fingers  is soo bitter about lol
YESSS TO THE DOCUMENTARY
Lol 😂 he made his own ad “shades”
A documentary of Elsy's life edited by Benny omg yesssss please do so!!!! Yall are so creatively smart I swear!!! We definitely want that!!!!! This right here is what we needed too I love yall ❤💖 Elsy is my motivation to shine bright as a single mommy and relate so very much to her! ❤
Lmao Benny of course you remember isn’t that when TreTreTre proposed lmao 😂😂😂
Am I the only one who thought they were sisters this whole time 🤦🏻‍♀️ so out of the loop lol
Would love to see elsys documentary 🙌🏽
yess I would love a documentary elsys story is related to able I would like to know why elsys is elsy❤️❤️
I’m weak Alondra baby girl we knew y’all was together. Let the haters hate 🤣🤣🤣
Get the Murillo Twins on 👯‍♀️
#Elsysdocumentary
ELSY! ah so beautiful love how your doing many blessings BUT what kind of foundation do you use ?? looks so flawless! :)
Elsy with the microphone Made me think About the frozen microphone Alondra bought for her because she talked so soft😂😭
I have to disagree, the drama/this situation doesn’t define Elsy. This is just one chapter in her life, she’s so much more than that…she’s a successful woman, a go getter, entrepreneur, and kick ass mother. She’s known for more than this bump in the road.
Yes to Elsy's mini docu-series!! Hopefully they go through with it. Super anxious for that. her story is very inspiring🙏🏼
Yes we would love to know more about Alos upbringing and the way she grew up, that would be very interesting 😀😀😀😀
Bout to shoot my shot in the DM’s wish me luck 😬
We need that documentary fersure
Elsy is happier without that garbage trash.its only so obvious. Yes she's still going through it like she said but she will be okay in time and she will look back on it how much she's grown and prosper from all the bad negative energy she had in that relationship
Elsey will need to be careful. In court they use EVERYTHING to prove a point. She probably needs talk to her lawyer for the do and don't.
A documentary about elsy would be so inspirational for many people we need it!!
i needed this 😩
A documentary would be great!
not benny doing his own commercials lol
Esly being in jail is me!!!!😭 I remember telling myself “I don’t belong in here”. All the cops walking by would just look at me, i think they knew I didn’t belong in there. It sucked!!! Worse 12 hours of my life ahaha
🌵🌵🌵🌵🌵🌵
Interview Alondra
The way alondra is feeding her baby lol
I loveeee this 💙
You guys are awesome for helping us get to know Elsy a little deeper, she is awesome 🤍🥲
Poor baby elsy! : ( she is so sad 😭 u can hear her pain at some points in the video that she just wants to cry by being asked certain trigger questions! I love u elsy! Stay strong my love 🤍 I’m going through false accusations as well and it is the hardest thing in the world but stay focused and stay strong cause you will make it! One day or another. The light will shine! And karma will be ruled!
Not the behind the bars picture 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🥲
Benny and alo! Ugh love them and love elsy but I can’t wait for elsy to find herself a real man so we can see them go on double dates! 🥰😍
Can’t wait to see the documentary!!
A documentary is definitely needed! I would LOVE to see it!! 🤍
Her biggest fear was to be a single mom yet got pregnant by a guy she barley knew lol
Elsy it would be pretty interesting if you made a video about OOTDFash! I’ve been so interested in how you started, how to keep going with the trends and all that!
💖💖💖💖
Hell yea would love to see the documentary!
🤍
“We feel for you elsy” but let me use your tragedies to get views smh
I feel like the baby looks so much like alondra I don't see any of Benny in him yet lol
I loveeeee Elsy!!!!!
Hay mucha gente que te adora ❤️ tu puedes con esto y con mas !!  (Thank you, next)
ANIMO ELSY !! Si se puede 🤞🙏
About time someone got Elsy a microphone.  Elsy I understand your situation 100%, the pain in your voice is heard & understood. I love you & admire your strength; you’re truly an inspiration. You got this girl, sigue luchando ❤️
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣the officers haha some are cool
how is this the 1st episode i’ve watched😭 where the hell have i been🥴
https://youtu.be/nqznxusd7LM
👍
Im here for the documentary
For some reason when I'm trying to record a message in YouTube negative blocks me it's a complete B's.🖕🖕🖕🖕
I never heard about this whatever you call it
If I was good enough to even be with Elsy or “an elsy” I would be hand and foot for her 😭😭
Hella off subject but your hair looks 👌🏽
Yes make Elsy’s documentary!!
Wait why was elsy in jail ?
As long as elsy is happy that's all that matters stay happy for the baby!
The fact that Elsy’s microphone sounds so low towards the end of the video 😭😭😭
Damn so she cheated on tre!!! That’s outta line, pretty fucked up how everyone bashed tre!
Love this!
I love you all god bless n yes 4 the early documentary
Thank you for sharing your story Elsy.
PLEASE RELEASE THAT DOCUMENTARY  LOVE ELSYYY!!!!!💕💕
Omg Im dead I listened to this podcast on Spotify and Benny had me dead when he did the sunglasses ad, he sounded so funny!
Did alondra jump at 8:47? Lol
I’m dead with the blenders shout out
Grow up
You don’t have to force the pacifier, babes. He’s fine without it. Babies don’t need a pacifier, it’s just used as convenience for the parents. I didn’t use it for any of my kids.
Ahh a documentary would be AMAZING!!! Please do it! 😩💞
Documentary?!?! HECK YESSSSS!
you can tell elsy wanted to cry so bad talking about ehlani poor thing
I’d definitely watch the documentary. I find Elsys story interesting.
Aww the baby looks so cute 😍😍😍 congrats Benny & Alo
I would want to see the video y’all talked about at the beginning 🙌🏼
Benny look skinny 😲
4:10 when Baby Legend smiles 😭 so adorable 😭❤️
Benny is teething so bad pobrecito by the way he’s trying eat that bobo so bad lol ❤️🥰😍
We would love the documentary!
Play it safe

Elsy is such a humble person. Such a good person deep down & a bomb ass mom to her baby girl elani. Her & alondra have such a great friendship ❤️❤️❤️
Alondra is me , self snitching about watching all the drama
Love this, love how open and real you guys are.💗
Elsy documentary!! ✨✨✨💕
Alo just wants to burst out laughing when Benny asks how elsys been doing 😹 #seriousmoments 🤣
Yall giving me life. Im gonna need more vids of yall three. Its gonna be the B.A.E. crew just so yall know 😏
Elsy for sure did needed her Elsa mic 😅
Not me getting an ad in the middle of the Hello Fresh ad ummm rude 😐
He’s going to regret it Elsy, your baby girl will grow up and this is all online forever and she will see her dad messed up and that’s his fault
The documentary is an amazing idea she can inspire so many women I don’t care what she’s been thru she’s an inspiration every one has baggage that’s life but she made it despite all of her odds I’d love to know more about her 💕💕💕👏👏👏👏
Damn “Christian blends isn’t step dad material “ cold world  🤣🤣

JUST RANDOM GIRL LOST IN COMMENT SECTION 😛
💖ELSY WE ARE WITH YOU THROUGH THIN & THICK LOVE YAH MAMI ‼️‼️‼️❤️‍🔥‼️‼️‼️
trending porque somos chismosos.
I completely understand where Elsy is coming from with not dating after the whole situation that she went and is currently going thru. I never wanted to bring any guy around my kids after me and the kids father broke up but I found a guy kind of happened put of nowhere and I was scared to bring my kids around him took me about 2 years and we are still together and ots going on 10 years in January. Alot has happened and the kids lost their father in 2016 to suicide and my BF was definitely here for me and the kids during that hard time I don't remember but hang In there Elsy it does get easier and of your meant to have a guy around it will happen. Focusing on your daughter is the very best thing you can do for her and yourself to help you get thru. Take care ❤❤❤
I’m so down for that documentary
Yes a documentary
https://youtu.be/g0mwmqEfONI
The greed is real making new YouTube channels
How and why is this trending ?
Bro the baby don't want any more milk jeez lol he's hella struggling to stop feeding and u ain't paying attention
I remember the cochinero and top ramen in their apartment lmao fodongis but they didn’t fake the funk about it 🤣🤣
I love Elsy! And just praying for her and thanks for being vulnerable even during such a difficult time. God bless all of you!
Love this❤️ love u guys ❤️
We need that documentary…
When my daughter was little she was very attached to me by a long shot but now that she is 7 she is definitely a daddy's girl!!!
There’s a restraining order against them? Omg
alondra coming in like a magician @ 8:46
Literally love you guys. So relatable and everything you guys say hits close to home. Praying for all of you always🤍
Liked today’s episode poor Elsy she has been going through so much I admire her strength. I would like to see alondra talk about her life she’s more of a mystery lol
The way the baby is looking at Elsy🥺😍
We all been to jail 🤣
Benny look and sound like he popped 3 xannies. Get it together my boy
Baby Benny so cute smiling at elsy at 4:10 like aight she cool 😎🥺💙
No one cares get off the internet
Tell me why when i read “Elsy jail experience” i thought they were talking about her past relationship..💀🤣
It was the “Byeeeh” from Alo & Elsy at the same exact time 😂❤️
Elsy def needs a documentary she is very inspiring and all the challenges she’s faced and how she got to where she is
As someone who went through a similar situation growing up I feel for you. As a mom I can personally relate to you and your situation I believe that there is two sides to every situation but only God himself knows the truth. Elsy are the best mother baby E can ever ask for and that’s all that matters.
They have such a good friendship i wish nothing but the best for them
I’ve been saying “ i’am dead” so much and my mans like where tf you get that and I told him idk I forgot 😭 and now I know it’s because of Elsy😂💖💖
I still wanna know why else went to jail . Lol I love her
Sooooo nobody is going to talk about that edit where Alondra just pops back up on the couch with baby Legend 😂😂
🔥🔥
I’m in the shower listening to this! Love it!!!!
I can’t wait this will be a movie 🍿!!! I’m excited for all you guys n Elsy keep pushing you didn’t push hard to give up now you got it girl !!
I think Alondra was trying to say in the future once Elsy recover/ heal from this and date again she is going to know what’s for and whats not for her which is going to be great for her and her baby. Everything will come in place whether u do it alone or not ❤️❤️❤️
Awesome friendship! …. But why is Benny the best advertiser! 😄🤙🏼🤍💙
I’ll continue to support Elsy she is an amazing person and she will always be known as the beautiful personality and a great person… 🌵💜much love from NM
yes to the documentary!!
I’m so glad to see this! I don’t know any of you guys, but I’m going through a gross custody/divorce battle and allegations of child abuse was made towards me. It’s horrible. This stuff changes lives and is terrible for the babies to go through. Sending so much love to all of your families houses and just know you aren’t alone!
Their friendship is beautiful 🥺 At 17 I became a single mom (I was still in high school) and I never thought about being a single mom, God knows why he removed that person from our lives and for me from my daughter as well. I hope you win her custody because kids feel saver with moms. May God keep blessing you and baby E🙏🏻🧡
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates..🎈
I feel like Benny gave some honest advice to Elsy, and letting her know that she can change the conversation about her and her “brand” instead of continuing to let this drama be the narrative around her. That’s a good friend because it’s not always easy to give the tough advice. Elsy will definitely get through this smarter and stronger 🤍🤍
Hell Yesss!!! I would love to see that Documentary on Elsy...I cant wait! I really enjoyed this podcast 💕👏👌🙏
They have such a good friendship i wish nothing but the best for them
The way baby stares at Elsy❤️😊
I really love this episode, such great people, they are so relatable🤩
These people are plastic
So amazing 😍
They have such a good friendship i wish nothing but the best for them
A documentary would be awesome 👏🏼

As always, great video! Elsy is doing the correct thing and not speaking on the situation. At the end of the day it's about her daughter's life and any little thing can be used against her. So kudos to her! Benny and Alo are the best support system and friend anyone can ask for! Love you guys ❤🙏
Baby legend is player 001 from squid games.  LOL

Check it out but if you know, you know !!! I support you elsy & yess y’all already know people here for the drama!!! But Bring more content with all positive vibes.

C🥰💯🥴 lmao Chris is some type of material but sure ain’t ready to settle down!! Got mad love for all you!! We see. Alo come up & you will! That’s why she got full belief for you 💕❤️‍🩹
Lol @2:36 after Elsy says she can't say her dads a fucking btch, Alondra looks so proud of her
I love seeing you guys always being there for elsy 💕 I love the eye contact you give Benny , shows you care & pay attention to everything she has to say 🙌 I’ll keep praying for you elsy i know it’s hard but hopefully within time everything works out ❤️
I thought I was gonna had to turn up the whole volume 😂😂😂 Benny glad elsy was speaking we need frozen mic 🎤  back 😂
bennys haircut looks fire
I’m ready for that documentary if elsy is ready to put her whole life publicly like that ! 💘
We are here for Elsy not for you
Oh my god yes I wanna see the documentary..  I’m so proud of elsy and how far she’s coming!💓 God bless her. She’s so mature
Children that young are still very much attached to mom. She shouldn’t be away from her that long 🥺 that’s crazy. Hope it’s all over soon 🙏🏼❤️
Weird ass ad placement bro
This is so sad :/ poor elsy I know she’s suffering so much
Yeah you guys are friends fr bc very few friends make it past the roommate stage 😂 AND y’all hadn’t known each other for long. So happy you guys are such good friends even through the different chapters ❤️
Im here for Elsy’s documentary Yasss!!!! Please hurry and film it lol
Yes I want to see Elsy more on this channel ❤️🥰❤️🥰❤️🥰
Not double standards you had clout cuz of tre cuz he was friends with the fakebrooms so yeah people think you give the p for the clout alondra worse than elsy but they both weird af.
I want to see the documentary for sure!!!!
I want a documentary!!!
Benny seems awkward lol 😆
Benny saying Elsy got pregnant fast when he and Alondra got pregnant 7 months after meeting each other 😂😂🤣
https://youtube.com/shorts/AO5lgaZlgHk?feature=share
I think the documentary of Elsy is a great idea. There is so much we can all relate to. Her and how she grew up.
aw elsy we are here for you🥺🤍
The way Alo looks at both Benny and Elsy with such attentiveness and joy 🥲 and yess we’ll be waiting for that documentary!
I love seeing the good things I thing some people just exaggerate
SEEEEE Alondra kinda cheated on oh tre tre boy by talking to el nopalero benny wowzerss 💀
This was a good video the vibes are good☺️
Your friendship story made me love you both that much more.
#Elsy’sDocumentarie✔️
Best episode!!! All 3 are so humble 💙🙏🏽
I love you guys!! Y’all all vibe together so good (:
Im Down for the documentary
Else the fact that you are keeping your negative comments to yourself is the best thing you can do for your daughter. She will grow up one day and she will be reading all these negative comments her dad posted and she will know who he is
Yess a Documentary of Elsy would be good. I would love that!!
Yes do it
Yes!!!! Documentary 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
I would love to see that elsy documentary!💕
The child needs the same sex parent more than the opposite parent. A parent that does not have custody yet can keep the baby and not allow the other parent to see child until custody is drawn up! If the parent had the child before custody they are kore than likely to get custody of child and other parent will get visitation. Elsy make sure to have papers drawn up before you send baby back to dad! If he was mean to you, he could treat he like shit in the long run! Be safe!!!
Where is the documentary of his mom??? I can’t find it.
Yeah really love elsy & alo, they’re a lot more relatable and funny. Instead of like stuck up Ig models. I fwwww bad 🥰🥰
Yessss documentary ♥️♥️😎
Yes a documentary not to be nosy but me a single mom I would love the inspiration and How you got where you are and not give up.
Can’t wait  to see for Elsy ‘s documentary , and yes,definitely want to hear about Alondra’s story🤗🤗
“That was a long time ago” lmao it was just last year
🖤🖤
Elsy is so beautiful 😍
Awe baby Benny just looking at elsy 😍😍
@4:09 mins when baby Benny smiles as he is looking at Tia Elsie and no one noticed it 🥺. Hermoso bebesito 💞
💕💕🙌🏼🙌🏼🔥
Elsy! You are a strong momma! Especially for not taking it public & “exposing” y’all’s relationship to people on the internet. Yes you have supporters that ride for you but you also have those that are looking at you to fall & everyone then decides to give their “input” EVERYTHING DOES COME TO LIGHT. & the only one who needs to see that true light is ehlani. Social media doesn’t need that true light, everyone will still believe/run with what they want to believe.   Ehlani, She’s the only one who matters. 💖🙏
Elsy stay strong remember there's always a light at the end just keep moving forward and positive i been there  and trust me God  will be there for you 🙏 and your daughter never give up and just let people talk but always stay strong true will always come out.
Annoying the way they say “I’m dead!” Huuuuuuhhh!🤨😒
Dude baby Benny looking at Elsy smiling is everything 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Yes more podcasts missed you guys hanging out together
Yes a documentary  will be nice alot single mothers would relate
I can't wait love y'all I can't wait for the video of her life
We want the documentary! It’s the most relatable story I know in the internet!
So she cheated on Tre? Lol “hella months” she was engaged in November and started talking to Benny in December on that Montana trip 🤣 expose yourself babe lol your HAPPINESS tops everything all of it ❤️
I remember the glow in the dark party video. YouTube hated and took it down. It was 🔥
This made me laugh so much , they such funny ppl ❤️
Yes !! We would love to hear that from elsy♥️just the fact that she isn’t alone!
Amazing trio! You can see how good of a friendship yall have. With the support. Would love to see documentary. And hoping for more success and happiness for all three of you! 💚
Love how real and raw Elsy is, being open abt how it really is being an influencer and that its not as easy as it’s portrayed on social media. She’s a women with real world problems and is proof that no matter how hard things get, you can always get back up. Love y’all sm❤️❤️
Really liked this podcast! Much love for all 3 of you guys ❤️
Elsy doesn’t whisper anymore 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼😹
Mama francis liked how baby Benny looking to elsy smiling to her I’m glad you are a good friendship we love you guys🙏💖💙🌺
I think you should do a documentary on Elsy but also your other YouTuber friends! I loved watching the documentary about your mom.
Love how they support Elsy 🥲💓 wishing the best !!
A documentary about elsy and her past would be so eye catching and a piece of real life and what happens. And her successful outcome. 🙏

36:46 Alo ans Elsy saying "byeee" at the same time 🥺
Benny this was an amazing show . You hit so many pointers for others who are or went through the same as Elsy! Elsy you are a strong female from a another single mom I know exactly how you felt I as well came from a broken & fucked up background but every day you get stronger & the cloud will shine .  Alo & Elsy your friendship is so special only God knows why he bought you together ❤  you guys are lucky to have one another. May God bless you guys always  Yesssss for me for the  Documentary

Elsy you look soooo much happier 🥰 no one ever wants to be a single mother but when your in a toxic relationship it’s what’s best ! Your time will shine again love keep your head up and focus on you daughter yourself and your job 🥰🥰🥰 love seeing you smile !!!!
You should do a documentary on ODM that would be cool how he started rapping and his life🤩
Yess do a documentary I would love it!💖🥺
Those 2 adds weren’t the right deal
Alo touches her hair to much ! 😭🤣❤️ love ya boo ❤️
Does anyone know what type of haircut Benny has ?
I hate to say this because I love you guys and watch you guys but alondra you look like you are forcing the The pacifier and then the bottle it started to make me nervous so  I had to stop watching. Im not one to say anything but I wouldn’t forgive myself if I didn’t say anything
I would love to see elsy documentary 😩!!!
The way baby Benny looks at elsy from 4:00-4:20 😭🥺🤍
“I skipped some chapters” omg story of my life lmao i love all y’all 3 together ❤️
Love your guest
Alondra and Elsy should def turn their channel into like a moms channel. Just stuff about the kids , vlogs with the babies and just stuff like that 🤍✨
I watch Benny's ,alondra's and elsy's videos & the one they have together & theses videos as well 💯🤷🏻‍♀️❤️
Look at Legend!!  He’s Big Papi!  🥰
YouTube becoming the real housewives
Only the REAL ones know about Elsy’s ELSA mic 🎤 🤣
I would love to see more into elsys life. I know it’s gonna be so inspiring more then she already is 💕
❤️
I love all three of them!! My favorites!!!
23:04 how Alondra was looking at her ♥️ she’s been with her through the tough times & she’s just ready & can’t wait for the day for her to have such an amazing & healthy relationship ☺️☺️ I love Alondra & Elsy ♥️♥️♥️  BTW: the video you made your mom I cried!! I love it!!
Elsy from a single mom with a daughter as well I want to tell … you , you are doing a GOOD JOB with your daughter and You are a great MOMMA‼️ Being a single mom is the best thing you can be instead of having your baby grow up in toxic environment and trust me your baby will thank you and know that you always chose her over anything And anyone. I praise you and thank you for being the wonderful human being that you are. We need more people like YOU in the world ❤️
Let’s see an elsy documentary!!💗💗💗💗
Yes a documentary would be great. Elsy is a great mother and doing everything to protect her Baby, so they can both be happy 💗💗
I'm team DAD all the way in the aspect that dads are important in their child's life I was raised by a single dad. After becoming a mom I feel babies at a young age NEED their mom 24/7 .. 5 days is definitely too long without being with MOM. Hope everything works out for you elsy and ur babygirl.
I was the same way as elsy, I didn’t even want kids bc of what I saw my own mom go through so I feel like I spoke it into existence too . I focused so much on “I don’t want to go through that & I don’t want to be a single mom” that I became one. It’s crazy 😅
Elsy is seems soooo sweeett ! everyone bashing her needs to back offf cause she already has so much shit going on.
Definitely would love to see one about alondras upbringing 😌😁
I love  you Elsy ❤️🖤🖤❤️
Definitely need more elsy talk
Yes !!! I would love to see the Elsys documentary
Not me listening to this while I clean and my baby sleeps, and thinking that baby Benny  fussing is my baby Mailo lollll. I’m scarred #parentlife
Okay okay but benny are you okay? 😕🥺 i send you healing energy  G u got this ! 🤍🙏🏼
I have the same mentality as elsy I never wanted to be a single mom ever. I’m not a mom yet but I am married and I plan to be with this man forever.
Elsy is so fucking mature .. I aspire to that grown and mature. Her babydaddy constantly bashes and she never responds idk how but she’s just so inspiring 🥺  I love you elsy and I hope you get through all the custody battles and other battles you’re fighting inside etc you got this ✨
I love it! All 3 can relate about having divorce parents. Happy to see them glow & grow✨  You are doing great Elsy you are beautiful, keep the chin up💯💗
We definitely need to see Alondra & Elsy again! A documentary about Elsy. sounds so interesting, her story is so inspiring!
Yes!  Elsy Life story and it would be good for baby E to look at when older.
Love this podcast yes Elsa documentary!
LOVEEEEE YOU HAVE SO MANY PROOF OF HIS TWEETS YOU CAN SHOW AT COURT TOOO!! DONT LET YOURSELF THIS IS WHAT YOU DO $ YOU CAN DO AND SAY WHAT EVER YU WANT
“omg elsy can I get a picture” 😭
I was goin to say that the nopales should bring elsy and ya did yesssss love all 3 of you 😊
This audio sucks Lmaoooo
Benny all smooth with the ad hahaha “speaking about the blended” 😂😂
Yes we need more videos of elsy Benny Alo forsure something I’m looking forward too! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Lmaooo tell me how I was also thinking about cristian to be with elsy🤣🤣🤣
Alo I'm not gonna Lie!!!! I'm subscribed to PANCHO!!!!!!
I went through this process as well I understand everything elsy going through stay strong 💪
Documentary will be a whole Rosa de Guadalupe episode!
I’m in favor for a documentary on all 3 of you. But Elsy we love you! You are so strong! Benny we appreciate the video! I look forward to seeing you 3 together on another video.
I love how real Elsy is she's not ashamed to say she came from welfare and didn't really have much. Another of YouTube forget where they came from and forget how real life is for people who don't have a platform. 👏👏👏 I love how she stays humble no matter what or how far she came💯 Here for it all💚
Elsy and alondra should have their podcast. Lol
5 day's with out her daughter!!!!!💔 my daughter is a daddy's girl... but oooh boy does she love her momma!!!! She's hooked to my hip!!!! So BABY E need's her mommy
I love how the 3 get along so well. The support is always there no matter what 💞💞
There friendship is everything ❤️❤️ Love you guys sm ❤️
I’m just hoping her baby daddy don’t start getting finger happy and start tweeting 😩 he’s so mean I loved this episode so much thank you elsy and Benny for letting us hear what others may be going through
Whatever you, Alondra and Elsy post I will always support. You guys are so genuine and I’m so happy for you guys!!!
I love elsy she's so strong 💜❤️  Yesss bring alondra to the podcast ☺️
Come on Elsy give the nopales Christian a shot he has to settle down at some point and you guys both seem like good peoples.
Yes to the documentary about elsy!
Haha that baby wants to crawl give him some free movement 😍😍😍
I love Elsy 💕💕 I would LOVE to see a documentary about her life!
You can tell Elsy just adores her babygirl and I agree w her. Babies should be with their mom more than half the time (depending on situations). It’s too much to bounce a baby around that much. You are amazing Elsy!! We are rooting for you 💜🙏🏼
Love this.... I would love to see Elsy's documentary.. And Alondra's life story.. Baby Legend is so handsome I wish i can hold him. Btw I love the way Alondra looks at Benny she's like yeah that's my man.. Its everything and so sweet!!!!!.. Love you guys I wish all of you'll nothing but the best everything will work out in your favor Elsy for Baby E
Give us a netflix series , documentary etc I feel like so many of us relate and have almost the same story we’d be so tuned in !!💕💕
I feel like Elsy wasn’t ready to have a baby she’s still confused about her personal life, she seems lost when she talks and answers the questions. Alondra as well. They are still youngsters. Benny in the other hand is a great ass father !
I feel like it would be such an amazing series I would love it with her story and his editing will look amazing so excited
The next soy la 69🤣🤣😂😂😭bennys a clown I love his humor 🤝
Elsy has such a genuine vibe I’d love to know her story 👍😁
Not many people experiencing the same thing you did so young could see themselves to be as successful as you have been so it’s amazing to hear about your past and see how you have come such a long way with your own business and setting up a great life for your daughter. It’s very encouraging .
Ily all! Just missing baby E 💗💗
I would love too see elsy’s documentary!!!🤩🥳
I love that elsy got the same glow alo got after leaving those toxic ass cousins. I can't wait for elsy to meet her Benny though 💙
Can definitely relate to elsy so much, I don’t have my dad in my life and I look up to her so much she gives so much hope to move forward how she has🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Omg elsy!!! 5 daysss!???? 😭😩 I feel like for a baby thought young she shouldn’t be away from her mom that long. Yes she needs her dad in her life but like Elsy said at the end of the day mothers are the number one providers they are always there for their kids day and night! Yes every child needs their father in their life but in this situation I feel like fathers should come visit, spend time with their kids but majority of the time should be spent with their mom
Drop the documentary  do a podcast with both Chris and elsy together to see how they act
Tell me why I cried when Elsy talked about how baby Alani comes home and she just looks all confused and not herself 🥺😭💔
Yaaass you guys should have her back soon for another episode love u guys 💕💞
Do the documentary !
I would want to see Elsy's story
I hear the sadness in Elsy’s voice when she talks about her daughter and the custody situation. I agree 5 days is way too long, I can’t imagine being away from my baby for 5 days!
You deserve to be happy Elsy❤️
Yes elsy documentary
I'm here for the doc. I love this vibe of all you together
Can’t wait till Benny gets a lil studio for the podcast!!
Don’t be shy LEAK THE PRANK lol
CALL IT "NEVER GOING BACK "LMAO
Elsy makes me feel normal I know everyone deals w breakups. I don’t wanna be around anyone either lol but seeing her open up to us makes me feel like okay time to start my life again
I would love to see her documentary 🙏🏻💛
Yes elsy need a documentary  or a part 2 I can listen to all 3 of them together all day.. or elsy and alo make a documentary together with the babies 🤍🥰 this was one of my favorite I love how we get to know our favorites YouTuber
Alo is cool with you hangout out with Coke heads?
Yes! A documentary on Elsy’s life and Alondra’s  💜💜
This mic way better than frozen mic
I think we all would like to see this documentary of elsy’s life. There are so many things that as a public eye figure you don’t get to see as a fan and sharing her life story would see a different side of Elsy. It would also inspire other people who have been through was she had.   Alo we need to go in depth of your upcoming to social media. ❤️ that sound be your next podcast Benny
Was it just me or did they just confirm that Alo was talking to Benny while being with Tre?!?! 😱 No la culpo!! Cause she upgraded!!! But damn!!!
Great episode 👏🏽 Sending Love and Strength to You Elsy 🤍
I want to see !
You guys need to do a who knows me better!!!
Elsy and Alo are admirable women 💘  ánimo  Elsy…..you got this 💕
Godbless from jodielee from Scotland ur amazing mum ❤
Smh he’s only there for baby because he’s obligated to. Yes I totally understand you are definitely the one who’s always there with baby when you guys were together. Guys are going to be guys. But you mama will always be with Ehlani. Just like me yes my baby dad helps but I’m the one with my two boys 24/7 feeds/change/showers them etc. You’re doing an amazing job and I know you will be with baby. Do not give you mama♥️♥️♥️
I want to hear about Alondras upbringing
I can feel your pain else your beautiful and you and baby E deserve so much better and I pray God has you both and blessed y'all with nothing but the best girl I'm in the same boat I hate having to co parent and share my babies with their dad
I love Elsy and alo you can tell the fame doesn’t get to them they are still true to themselves and are such good friends to each other I love the friendship between all three of them.
would love to see a documentary of both!!
“Mmm So we’ve all been to jail…” 😂😂😂im dead
Elsys face looks a little different or is it just me?
Hell yeah i love these podcasts!!
Benny, Thank you for having Elsy have a voice and share with us single mothers who have gone through DV that there is hope to THRIVE ! #Breakinggenerationalcycles
Someone help Alo with the baby 😂💗
Yes to the Elsy documentary! Her story is so inspirational. Hearing her talk about her past shows why she is the way she is now and I think she has blossomed into such a beautiful person and mother. Plus her daughter would love watching it when she is older 💙
Make that doc!!!
Alo looks soo much older, baby Benny keeps smiling so cute
YES DOCUMENTARY ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love this❤️❤️❤️❤️
Lots of prayers for Elsy🙏!!
I wish you three the best in your field of work and personal lives. This episode is so real it took me back to a book I read of childhood trauma “what happened to you”   A documentary would be interesting to see. A story that perhaps can help young girls and women. Hopefully men can be enlightened too by it? Overcoming and tribulations make us all humble and human. You got this Elsy! ✊
I fw all these people putting the raza on💯💪
Elsy is glowing & looking more beautiful than ever! And the fact that she will make sure her baby doesn't hate Elijah,  even though Elijah seems like he would definitely speak ill of Elsy to baby E smh, just proves what a REAL queen she is! 🙌💖👑
This was great interview now you all never have to talk about this again and she can get back to herself and be happy
I love how Benny can neutralize a situation/moment. In the beginning of the video it's a bit awkward obviously because of Elsy's situation, Benny right away knows what to say in a very comfortable, calm and professional way. He is very talented, and is a natural at all he does. Blessings your guys way!!! <3
The way elsy hides behind the microphone and shys away🥺 you can see her pain and struggles ever time shes put in the spot light. I hope she gets thru this and realize how bad she really is💕
we’re still waiting on the video of when elsy got arrested in catalina 😭😭😭😭
Yess would love to see the documentary 🤍
Blessings to you all Do what’s right Keep going forward
YES to a documentary on Elsys life! I can already relate to her so much!
when the baby was staring at Elsy & started smiling 😭❤️
Wow what a good interview..  I'm  glad Elsey  you're better and the truth Always comes to light. 🙏💟
I love the dynamic they have feels so chill and not force so glad you guys have each other regardless of everything else going on you three together are making great content and keeping her around making her feel better we need to see that documentary & the babies together!
YESSSSS TO THE DOCUMENTARY ♥️
Yes 👍 do the documentary on Elsy . Would like to know more about her life cuz she seems shy and very private and I get that.
Ehlani deserves to be with Elsy! Elijah Can get baby E every other weekend! At least that’s how it is here in Texas . Elsy is the provider and has her own place. Bet Elijah DOESNT . Elsy I pray you get your baby more often!
I look forward to the documentary. God bless you all!
Aww Baby Legend smiling at Elsy 4:10😍
You should do a podcast with Pancho!!
I hate that Benny always clickbaits people and puts them on the spot for views and no one calls him out on it. He admitted to putting the Christian thing online to mess with Elsy (as a joke) but damn like why would a FRIEND do that. Elsy hasn’t even spoken about the jail thing herself and Benny’s big mouth always gotta expose people like Maria, Elsy now, etc
This is such a healthy friendship. Benny good job on the podcast keeping the vibes light and at the same time touching on the important subjects.
Yesss we want the documentary y’all should even add the court
I would LOVE LOVE LOVE to see a documentary about Elsy’s life. 🔥🙏🏼
Yasssssss we need a elsy and sisters documentary asap their story is amazing and it needs to heard
I LOVE & admire this friendship so much!! Elsy was by Alo’s side through her downs & now ups & Alo is now here for Elsy through hers!! 🥺🥺 so wholesome and real I just love to see woman / people in general supporting and there for one another! 💫❤️
I wanna see the more videos of them together and there back stories
I would definitely watch an elsy documentary ❤️
Elsy and alondra have a really good friendship❤️ I hope everything works out for elsy you got this girl 💕
Live your best life elsy we love you! Buuuuuut Chrisblends would look pretty good sitting next to youuuuuu 😉
5 days is way too long. a good judge will correct that. drop the restraining order and show them it's not a weapon on your defense. been though all that and let's just say it all settled down a bit. it never will be smooth but when you stop the war it all goes away....
Esly keep your head up. god will continue to bless you.
Elijah Going To Talk Shit After This Lol 😂 You Guy's Have A Beautiful Relationship
We want the Elsy documentary
DO IT!!! ❤️
I have heard from a girl that’s from South Gate area that claims to be an old friend of Alondra when they were younger said they used to be really close. That Alondra was always out at friends houses most of the time because of family problems and never had a good relationship with her mom because her mom is a drug addict. Alondra never really talks about her mom or ever shows her in videos, I always hear Benny’s mom takes care of the baby when they go out too. If you notice, her and her younger sister are super close to their dad and don’t talk much about the mom. It makes it seem like it’s true but then again we wouldn’t really know the full story because like Alondra says, she’s never spoke about her upbringing. It feels like we don’t really know much about her background which is not something we have to know. It would just be cool to get to know her a little more and how she’s overcome it but if she’s not comfortable it’s understandable. 🙌💗
Love seeing the three of you together ❤️ We need a play date video 🥺
Documentary🙌🏼🙌🏼
I can relate to elsy I got pregnant after a month and man it was ruff trying to learn to co parent but here we are 4 years later and I’m so happy with the relationship we have , everything takes time and somebody is going to love her and her beautiful baby ❤️
Yes documentary on Elsy
I hope one day I can build a friendship like Alo’s and Elsy’s . They truly are a great example!
I just KNOW that if alo would’ve stayed with el greñudo, she would’ve been going through the same thing! I’m glad at least Alo is there for Elsy. Elsy deserves to have a healthy and genuine relationship (friendship) and you can tel Alo is the best and vise versa . I’m glad Benny is there for them both and supports their friendship 🫂
Duh I wanna see the Documentary!!! I LOVE ELSY 🥰
Do a documentary!!
Elsy is a strong as women❤️
Y’all should do a video on jealousy in a relationship and how you over come it!
When Elsy said “I can’t tell her, her dads a BITCH” I was like dayuuuummm lmao I know that’s right !!! 😅😂😂😂 I love her and alo 💗
i would love to hear about her story, it’s nice to know where she comes from & seeing how much she’s grown in life
Yesss make a documentary!!!
I would like to watch elsys documentary!! I really relate with her at the moment of life ! A year ago, I left my relationship with my babydaddy for domestic violence and mental!! It’s really hard being a single mother of 2 daughters and especially having no support of their father! It’s hard staying strong but anything for our daughters! We just gotta remind ourselves why we left that situation! For a better life !
I’d love to see a documentary about Elsy.  I’m ready to cry lol
I honestly feel like 5 days is way to long Elsy really needs to fight that because honestly a baby is supposed to be more with their mom plus the baby is growing up it can effect her
PLEASE DO THE DOCUMENTARY !!! I would love to see it 💖💖💖
YESS!!! ELSY is such a strong woman!!! & I can see God has good things in store for her!!!!
I would watch the elsy documentary legit
I wanna see the documentary!!!! I love elsy she deserves to have her story told right!!❤️❤️
Can't wait for Elsys documentary!!! Interview evee next !!! I wanna know what she's been up to
Definitely would love to hear more about Alondra’s upbringing. I think that you have overcome a lot! It inspires to see and hear what you have overcome!
Tell me why Benny’s littlecommerical break I watched the whole thing didn’t skip lol
Benny is me looking at tia elsy 😭💞
Elsy needs that mic all the time, for once she wasn’t whispering 🤣💀
Why didn’t Elsy take her frozen microphone 😂🤣
Now this is the episode I’ll watch lol
I would love to watch the documentary on elsy🙌
4:10 baby Benny smile 🥺❤️
It's cute how Baby Benny looking at Elsy and smiling to her
Hell yeah! A documentary on Elsy would be an honor to watch. Her story even from just the basis of it is very intriguing and can help the viewers connect with her and understand the stimulation more ❤️
I can feel Elsy pain when she speaks.  Keep your head up mama you got this♥️ Your a great mama. Benny and Alo yall are a great support system.
I love you guys ❤❤❤❤ !!!
I love Elsy ♥️ She will come out soooo much stronger and waaayyyyy happier in the end.
Who else heard it already on the prodcast but had to hear it again to see them lol!! 💗
This was my favorite podcast
I can't wait to see the documentary 💫💫💫😍🙌
Love this episode!!! Y'all are some amazing friends!!! Can't wait to see Baby Ehlani and baby Benny play together!!!
Aww love to see elsy smile😃.God bless her and the baby
I knew she didn't like Christian. I believe Elsy likes them pretty boys lol..seriously...her ex was cute , but had a black heart. I dated someone like him and he was a gorgeous Russian man..He looked like he had come out of a GQ magazine! I got to date him for about a month, but I didn't sleep with him;  just got to know him and found out he was an EVIL man! I hope Elsy finds a very good family man who would love her and the baby unconditionally.
The fact little Benny is just looking at Elsy and smile’s out of no where admiring aunty elsys beauty (4:08 in video timing)  😭❤️
YES!! A Documentary of Elsy’s life would be good!! We’d love to see all  that
Lmfao great questions guys!! aw I love u elsy your so inspiring and I hope the BEST for u and your family u guys deserve everything.. !!
Great pod cast. I was wondering about Elsy and how the custody was going on and stuff. Poor baby ehlani going back and forth to different homes. I've been around that type of situation and have seen it close hand;  it does affect the child psychologically and She's going to need a lot of help. Hope the best for them
I wish I had people like Benny & Alo and Elsy in my friend group. You can tell they are so genuine on and off the camera. I hope God continues to bless you all w/ great opportunities ♥️🥺 and Elsy I’d binge your documentary.. you are truly an inspiration to me
Alo brush your man’s hair
Yeah he’s wild he’s always coked out  he said it
I am dead is annoying ass fuck lmao. They always say that
documentary would be good!
Benny looks busted
How uncomfortable for how u gunna have her hold the microphone
lmaoooo she said he aint step daddy material  lol !!!
I’m a single mommy and totally relate. Would love to see this upcoming documentary!
I love this trio❤️❤️❤️
Do you still talk to evette and Ulysses?
Christian and elsy for the win😍😍 who knows 😏
A documentary would be so good to reflect on how she came to be who she is
Everybody has problems I don't get why everyone sees elsy different on her situation, it's more pressure for her, she's a normal gal trying to live her life please don't pressure her more than it already is. We love you elsy everything will come in good hands, god bless baby e and you for no sicknesses which is the better blessing!❤️
Benny you could straight up tell you just got out of bed. This is your job, look presentable.
It must be hard for Elsy to be happy for her best friend and their little new family wishing that was her also🥺💓
Amazing Benny! Sending Prayers to Elsy hope everything turns out well with her and baby Elani❤️
I was married for 18yrs and my husband had me arrested just like Elsys baby daddy did same charges everything! What is crazy is that these men try to be "in the music industry" rap about being gangsters yet are the First to jump and call the cops! Lol
Yesss a documentary of Elsy please!  & alondra too would be nice!
Why are you guys always forcing the pacifier & bottle on Poor Benny
Elsy your an imspiration to me. I'm a single parent and going through  navagating a lot. You are doing an awesome job.
Not me thinking the mic was a fan 😭😂
I would love to watch elsys documentary.
The way baby Benny look 👀 at elsy in the video so adorable 🥰
I just don't like that we see more of elsy only when she doesn't have her kid.. 😒
I know they wouldn't doit but it would of been halirius if Benny and elsy did a prank on alondra flirting lol
I love seeing these behind the scene’s podcasts with y’all’s friends. You talk about the history!of your friendships, and back stories to things we may not know. Elsy seems to be more of the quiet one on all of the group videos I’ve seen, or more reserved. I really loved this one and the one with your friend Bo. I especially love hearing like how you met and how you pushed each other in your careers. Don’t worry girls, I’ve been arrested twice. Once when I was 16 and my little theifing friend stole and I was with her in a Walmart. Hey kids in Indiana where I was visiting, if they stole , you stole. No accessories and they make it where you stole the same amount as separate. I wasn’t even with her when she took dumb stuff like bubble gum. And unfortunately as an adult some crazy lady cancelled a check from paying for a furniture item with a store. And when you cancel a check they see it as I stole her check. So the store called the po po on me. Luckily I was let go and she was arrested instead. But man people be trying to get you lol.
Sis what did Alondra do to her hair 🥺
Elsy I was you two years ago and girl it gets better and your totally right ! A daughter needs their mother the most you are her caregiver.
I'm not skipping the ads this time
I love you all! Prayers for happiness, peace, and health.  Btw Elsy maybe you are what Blends needs to calm down. Lol think about it.
Awww BFF goals when you say something at the same time with our knowing “Byeeee” 😂♥️☺️
Yes! Do a documentary!
YESSSSS we wanna see it all 🤩🤩
Ya need to get Alondra one of those call center headphones with a mic attached that you put on your head like a head band lmfaooo she over here trynna talk & multitask but we can’t really hear her 😍
When alo disappeared and popped back up out of nowhere 😂
Loved this episode
She’s so nice but Damn her communication skills 🤭 She Needs to Grab a book and read it’
Chin up elsy! Coparenting gets better. I hope you and E get to a happy medium for both you and him and baby E.  You will meet an amazing person and forget all this. I did & I’m happy and it all happened rapidly and randomly.
Benny looks like noticias 34 lol
It's called a temporary agreement
How Benny looks at elsy 🤣🥰
Alondra and baby popping back in the shot at 8:45 like some Wizards of Waverly Place sheeet 😭🤣🤣
🖤🖤🖤
These two woman are beautiful and such great examples to the young girls of the world I love how they stay true to theirselves and Benny you’re a great supporter of a real friendship and sisterhood.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE POST THE VIDEO WHERE YOU PRANK BENNY!! I WANNA SEE IT!! I KNOW EVERYONE ELSE WILL LOVE TO SEE IT TOO!!
when elsy and alo both said byeeee at the end 😂 it was so cute
Elsy is such an amazing mother.
Documentary!!!!
I could understand  you elsy...but ur daughter I hope and pray that ur daughter doesn't get separated depression from their moms...they get confused...just like my granddaughter..and now she's 3...and at times she just wants to stay with their mom.
Loved this episode
So proud how she’s handling everything and I can’t wait to see the documentary.
I definitely want to see this documentary!
Even with the mic on I can’t hear Elsy 😭
Definitely want to see her documentary!!!! Alondras too!
Yo wouldn't be a bad idea doing some them to answers our questions or whatever... #Benny #Alo #Elsy
Elsy: yeah, I slid in her dm’s Benny: whaaaa? Me too 😂 I love the dynamic between all of y’all. How happy Alo is and how much better Elsy looks. 🥺
Alondra tryin to make us upset “Make them wait for the documentary” Girl we’ve been waiting for almost a year and a half already
Im just waiting for Benny, Alo, Elsy & Crisssss!!!! What u waiting for Benny lol
I loved this episode of the podcast ❤️ elsy is a such a strong person ❤️ I admire her so much !
I really didn’t want this video to end 😢😭 more of these please ♥️
Yesssssss that documentary would be AMAZING EVEN MORE OPPORTUNITIES WILL COME AFTER THAT
I love yall three 💗  elsy you're gonna be alright , trust. GOD good you 🙏🏼
I just love there friendship.  Wish my BF wasn't  camera shy we would be able to record our memories lol
Benny your 🎙 stopped working 🔇
Elsy is my future wifey and baby momma  She’s my El Salvador 🇸🇻 queen...
What E is doing to her is revenge. He thought he could lower her self-esteem to keep her, but she said goose bye 👋🏽 now that she’s gone he wants the baby and her money and her reputation on the floor. What an ass.....
YES ALONDRA WE WANNA KNOW.
Elsy is improving her situation, she literally speaks up now lol We can finally hear her now 🥲 i don’t have to raise the volume 🤣  Hope nothing but success for all y’all ✊🏼
NO I DON’T THINK THATS WHAT ELSY IS KNOWN FOR. BD IS HELLA CHILDISH. WE UNDERSTAND.
Love this ♥️♥️♥️ I wish you guys always all the best in life 🙏🏼♥️
BENNY SHOULD TOTALLY WRITE A RAP FOR HER. IT WOULD BE HELLA FUNNY BUT GOOD AT THE SAME TIME.
Bro i didnt know yall had a podcast
I would love to watch that documentary 👍
WE LOVE YOU ELSY!!
Not Elsy forgetting the portable mic again lol I’d love to know Elsy’s story.
I love how Alondra shouted out elsy when she helped her come up 😍😍
Didn’t y’all get tired of holding the mic? Lol my hand would of been shaking
I love Alondra and Elsy so this will be a good episode but side note, your haircut been looking nice Benny!
OMG yessssss I wanna see the documentary 🙏🏽🙏🏽
Sayyyy the truth, tell um yall watch the best on Cali Blvd, panchitoooooo lmal
I would love to see a documentary of Elsy. Loved this podcast today.
But for real! Can you send the link to those shoe boxes behind you? 😂
the 3 musketeers!
Love their friendship! I had just started following them right before Elsy got pregnant. I too was confused when all of a sudden she was pregnant. She never made mention of dating.  Love these girls together. I want to see them more! Elsy stay strong! It’s not easy being a single mom but things happen for a reason. Believe in it. There are 2 sides to every story and I’m sure so sure he had a lot to do with it. I had him read really quick! I wondered what you were doing with him lol. Important thing is you recognized it and got out.  Ehlani will see it for herself when she grows up. It’s gonna seem like eternity but she will.  My daughter worshiped her dad. He was not a good dad. I never said negative things about him. It wasn’t until she was in her 20’s that she started seeing it for herself. I was like Jesus thank God now I can share my story lol! You did great in your interview! Proud of you!
I would totally see that documentary!! You can sense a nervousness and holding back on Elsie’s part understandably she’s doing the what’s best for baby e but would live to see her pop off just for her release as well emotionally.
Can't wait to see this upcoming documentary, will def inspire a lot of ppl
Yes Benny we want that documentary of Elsy!!! Please and thank you!!!
We need Ehlani and Legend play dates a life in Elsy and Alo with babies
The way elsy is talking about the co- parenting situation her voice sounds like she’s trying her Very best not to let it crack and trying hard not to tear up, you go momma i hope god is seeing your situation and puts you and your babygirl in the best hands you both deserve! 💖💖🥲
Man problems 🤣I know why Benny has a pillow on his lap🤣🤦🏽‍♂️
I think elsy should have ehlani 5 days a week and her ex should have her in the weekend because elsy is right the baby needs more there mommy also there dad but there mommy is what really makes them feel safe
Love this podcast literally the best!!!
Where the Elsa microphone at😂💓❄❄
I love all of you and Elsie story would help a lot of people
I love Elsy 💕she’s an amazing strong mother💞
Five days is so long I could tell how hurt she was :(
Okay but Alondra in black hair 😍😍😍
Elsy’s documentary would be FIREEEE🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 CANT WAIT!!! Love how happy you r booo, best wishes ur way😘😘
BRB while I go look for Elsy mug shot 😂
Should have gave Elsy the frozen microphone🤣 🎤
'I AM THE DRAMA' 🤣🤣
I love the vibe of all 3 of you together. Wishing and praying for a good future for Elsy and baby E
Awe I freaking love elsy & alo true friends we don’t see this to often anymore. 💗 def neeeeed the docu-series al elsy’s life she just scratched the surface on her channel of it and we need more.
Elsy thank you for being a good example for other girls who are in Unhealthy relationships you didn’t only do it for yourself but for your child it takes strength and courage to leave a bad relationship And I’m glad that you are not scared to be alone like some girls are I think some girls stay in unhealthy relationships because they are scared to be alone and be independent you are setting a good example and it’s truly a blessing your child will thank you later for being a strong mom and taking care of business I see that your not a bitter women and that’s great most women who get out of bad relationships end up bitter and miserable and it affects how they see life not only that it affects the children it’s so important to recognize Red flags so you can prevent a bad break up and prevent from getting your heart broken. Ignoring red flags will hurt you so much in the long run protecting your heart is very important you Only get one ❤️🙏🏼 elsy you are strong and Independent and your child will be so greatful for you when she grows up ❤️ sometimes being a single mom is a blessing my mom raised 6 kids on her own and I know it was hard but she still managed and that’s what’s important. God bless you on your journey of Healing and finding your true identity 🙏🏼
Can’t wait for the documentary !!! 💕💕
Soy la 69🤣
Omg yes, I want a documentary for Elsy 🤗🤗

Benny you really need a set up what is this !! Lol  Loved this podcast!!!
😍
Yes can’t wait for the documentary 💖✨
we want alondra & elsy’s  documentary!!!
Benny cut looking 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Elsy 🥺 I can’t even start to explain how much of a inspiration you are. I am also a single mom , but unfortunately his dad passed away 6 months ago. It’s really hard being a single mom and taking everyday how it comes. We never let our rain showers pour on your children and that’s what matters. You are strong 💪🏼 keep your head up high and always keep these two by your side. A strong support system is everything. You have this path for a reason 💜 shine light on all that’s hard to talk about when being a single parent🙏🏽
Alondra sitting there like 👁👃👁
I’m here for the documentary ❤️ love this podcast
Baby won't take his eyes off Elsy 😄😆
LOL 🕶️ I was like waiiiiit .. WHAT ? Christian Blends has his own 😎 Sunglass line ? I was already happy for him ☺️ BLENDERS 🕶️🌵
Love the idea of a Documentary about Elsy , We would love to see that especially because Elsy is still evolving and we love to see how she is overcoming so many obstacles and going about it in positive ways  .  Using her influencer status to the fullest just knowing that there are people out there going through similar situations and through her struggle she is also helping others 🙏🏻 We love Elsy & Ehlani 💕 and what better person to do the documentary than a very good and trusted friend like Benny &  of course Alondra  too ❤️ Yes do it Benny 💯

Love you guys, baby Legend is soooo cute! Missing cutie Ehlani. 🙏 For Elsy. Beautiful family Beny & Alondra God bless you all ❤️
Loved that you had Elsy on. I wish it would’ve been a bit longer and gone more into depth seeing that she’s a hot topic right now.
ALWAYS love this trio! The love, support and genuine friendship is beautiful❤️
all i know is that elsy better be saving his little ass tweets bro. The fact that elsy decides to stay neutral  says a lot. #Justice for Elsy  #freeelsy
I love this video God bless you and your baby girl.

Why did she go to jail lmaoooo
I love you Elsy! As a single mom since my son's dad cheated & I kicked him out 13 years ago... my best advice to you is get FULL CUSTODY! my "Husband" can only see my son whenever my son feels like seeing his "Dad" which is hardly ever.  My son is 14 now and he is too smart ... he knows wussup with his "Dad"  let's just say he's a total #momsboy & he has all the love he needs here at home. Im just repeating to you what my son has told his grandmother and grandfather! Anyway.  I love you guys . Love the nopal podcast 🌵 🌵 🌵
Yes !! Documentary please

Benny and Alondra Are So Supportive To Elsy . I Love The Positive Energy They All Have Together . Everyone Needs A Bestie Like Alondra And A Supportive Boyfriend Like Benny ❤️🙏  Wish You All Nothing But The Best In Life ! God Bless You All Always ! My Fav Influencers ❤️ Y’all Always Keep It Real 💯
Love this trio 💕💕💕
Definitely need that documentary !!
The fact that Benny is uplifting Elsy is everything & you could tell he’s saying it from the heart , Alo is such a great friend #friendshipgoals , their whole friendship reminds me of my Bestfriend … Love you guys & May God Keep Blessing Ya !!! ♥️♥️
Remember one thing lfe is just a test.. No one's prefect, don't judge. We all have a dark side.. So haters put your negative thoughts into her position.. She's not bashing nobody She's getting her priorities straight.
Alondras story is a must !
Completely off topic but Alondra would look so good with short hair
Love elsy! 💕 waiting for immature E post his nonsense 💀
Baby Benny is so cute 😍😍😍
Would love to see Elsy's documentary 🥺♥️
I’d love to see a documentary of elsy
Not me trying to find their mugshots 😂😂😫😫 I love this trio 💗💗💗
Loveeee you Soo much Elsy 🥰
Sending nothing but good vibes and prayers for Elsy. She doesn't deserve all this mess. 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
I’m an older viewer and I so wish I could speak to Elsy about her situation because I went through the same and I feel her pain and frustrations. Elsy people will always find something bad to say. Don’t worry about the court of public opinion worry about the real court who cares what we think the outcomes you feel will not make a difference in our lives but they will in yours life. Just know you will meet the perfect man for you when it’s meant to happen. Look at me I went through hell from the beginning of my life on a reservation to now living a happy life in Temecula with a supportive husband and 2 daughters (17, 21) that on their own came to see the true colors of their biological father without me every saying 1 negative word about him. 💕💕💕💕
I would love to see that documentary
I think it’s such an amazing idea to make a documentary like video
Can’t wait to see the documentary!
This episode ❤️ yass
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Loved it ! At one point it just got really hard to hear Benny and Alo!
YES ELSY DOES HAVE A VERY INTERESTING STORY
Love this podcast
I can’t wait for her documentary 💙
We love ELSY!! I don’t think I can say that elsy is  being known for being in real life situation if anything thank you for sharing your true life with everyone thank you for being open and showing reality. Being a Single yet so successful mom is very inspiring. Best of lucks keep praying Elsy everything will fall into place keep doing your part as a mom making sure your baby is happy as possible❤️
Benny seems like a brother to Elsy like protective of her. I'm glad she's got him and Alo she needs a good support system.🙏🏻♥️♥️♥️
Elsys story will touch so much people , the video she did by herself explaining her last broke my heart and I’m so amazed by how hard she’s fought to get to where she is.
Not me thinking that todays sponsor goes to cristian blends 😂😂
Why is she forsing the baby to get the pacifier?????!!!!
Watch Cristian and Elsy get together...
Wow , I feel her pain . But being mature about it. The truth always comes out on the end . Benny , you should do a documentary 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼  keep on grinding love watching all of u   guys. .
Yes yes !!!! I need that documentary 👌🏼
Hiiii Elsy! Even though you might be known as “drama” nowadays, you are handling this whole situation very respectfully and mature! You are a wonderful mom and like you said, everything will come to light. You got this BITCH!!!! WAAAHOOOOO TWERK TWERK TWERK
Admire you slay you’re so strong 💕
The way baby Benny looks at his tia Elsy 😍😍
lovvvve Elsy!!!!!!
Benny needs to really needs to make more documentaries on other influencers it would be amazing think 🤔 about it Benny
PLEASEEEEE UPGRADE UR SET UP 😩😩😩 ALO NEED A MIC !!
Hi! I'm watching Benny  show l really think utube doesn't like Hispanics because l couldn't  print out The Nosal show, you see how it keeps coming our and that was on 30 tries! Anyway l could be out of what Ya'll are taking about, but Alondra seems so Happy and l'm Not trying to bash the EX but she looks like she is 20 years older than him and he is not True to her but whatever, just saying You and Benny look really in LOVE, and Baby is Beautiful! God Bless Ya'll!
Elsy is so strong, I couldn’t be without my son for 5 days… I think her ex is just keeping baby e so he can get money from elsy, he’s probably not even with baby most of the time. Pinche mantenido like what he asked on the court papers for money… his parents failed at making him a man.
I think there is a lot that is still very hurtful to Elsy and opening up about it can be really healing. Whether she decides to do that on the internet I hope that it helps her because she really deserves it. From the little bit I see she is very family oriented and a great friend but she is guarded and sensitive. Your time will come when all of that is reciprocated. 💖
Yasssss I have my popcorn ready for the documentary
The way alondra looks at elsy and Benny she just seems so proud of them :)
love you Elsy your a great mother, your family and your true friends know the person you are , keep your head up  you got a great best friend  Alo is such a beautiful person and Benny is a dope guy very loving and respectful and caring❤️
I was waiting for this one !! Yesss
“I skipped some chapters, whole ass book” lol I love it 😂😭
Definitely agree that Elsy should make a documentary
U got this Elsy , I’m happy that your in a better place , remember you can do all things through Christ who strengthens you  — philippians 4:13
5 days!? Oh no Elsy is too nice. Ehlani is still a baby I agree that is way too long for any baby to be without their mommy. I hope the court gets that situated in December🥺
you should do a documentary on Elsy! I’d watch it
“I am the drama channel “😂😂
I would love to see a documentary of Elsy’s story 💗💗
He just using her name for clout 💀💀
Say no more, we need the documentary 🤌🏼
I know Benny didn't mean it in a bad way but I felt bad for Elsy when he told her she was known for her drama now😬
Alo is the bestie everyone needs 💓
Baby Legend staring Elsy down at 3:20 is everything 😭 He’s like,… you better not be lying to my parents foo 🤣🤣🐻💙
HELL YEAH let’s see a documentary that would be tight , literally love this combo ❤️
Yassss in the documentary!!!!
I like how alo is like I don’t like talking about it on the internet then Benny goes “if u guys are interested we can talk about that as well” 😂 also elsy your coming on top stay blessed everyone
Alo love you but you should never feed the baby laying down he can choke and he looks like he’s struggling to drink it , ughh I’m so sorry I’m a mom and I jst can’t but I love you guys
The way baby legend looks at everyone 😭😍❤️
Love this !!!
I know this isn’t really y’all thing but maybe get all the YouTubers and play a squid game type thing!! For entertainment obviously I just see u doing big things big production status like the sidemen
As a supporter of Elsa & ofc you and & alo. I truly wish a light at the end of tunnel for you elsy. You’re an amazing momma & any true supporter knows that. Some men are so narcissistic its disgusting. Those negative comments are pure drama and those people live for it, it definitely sucks.
hell yeah we wanna see the documentary
yesss a documentary!!!
To those 6 dislikes ….YALL CAN GO EAT A BIG FAT NOPAL 😂
Not the spraying people with colognes n shit at Macy’s 😂😂😂😂
Yeesssss Elsy and Benny doing a documentary would be insane! Inspirational, educational and just amazing.
Baby bennys smile at elsy was so adorable.
I wish the best for Elsy and I hope and pray she can make it past this and her and her baby girl will be happy . What a beautiful soul. You got this mama
Omgg I loved this episode so much hit us with that documentary we need to hear it all , I also grow up with out a dad & my mom Made it happen the motivation on elsy is much needed ❤️
Yesss I want to see the doc 🥳
How come I’m just finding this channel omg 😱 i love you guys
Yes I'd love to see the documentary!
Yes the trio on another podcast 🙌🏼👏🏼👏🏼‼️‼️👀👀
I know all the real supporters will love to watch the Documentary of elsy......just to hear alil bit about her child hood reminded me about mines and i am pretty sure of many we can all relate and made me tear up alil to know how much shes been through and still is shes a women warrior period.
Elsy should just be a co host
The way Elsy said patience just reminded me of how Stormi was saying patience in that one video 😭 but I love you guys and your content 🥰
Benny you should bring shyla to the podcast
Loved it 😍 keep your head up Elsy you will see the light 💡 at the end && Benny great job 👏🏼 love the podcasts you have been doing 🥳🙌🏼
Part 2 please 😍😍
SUGGESTION: if you added a table and seating and some mic stands it would be more pleasing to watch :)
We all love you Elsy🤍
You got this momma ! You show us you’re a good momma !!! Keep staying strong for your babygirl at the end of every tunnel there’s the sun 💘 this is just temporary, I hope you get justice for what he made you go through !
I love this trio the vibe between you 3 is so genuine, can't wait to see the documentary you can tell Elsy feels comfortable talking to you. Wishing you all so much more success and happiness you all have overcame so much you give others hope this was my favorite episode
Baby Benny said : 👁👄👁 @elsy
It would also be excited if you put South Central LA in the map since that’s where she grew up #documentary
We need more elsy
S/O to Benny for giving elsy an opportunity to tell her truth. I’m sure it was much easier this way then a sit down video alone.
We need more trio episodes
When I first started following elsy & alondra I also thought they both owned ootdfash 🤣🤣🤦🏻‍♀️
Yaaasssss
My dawg Benny 🙏🤟🏼🎭🖤
I could not be away from my daughter for 5 days. You're soo strong Elsy! I will pray for you 🙏
Why didn’t elsy use her frozen microphone 😂
I like this video the most.
The way baby benny looks at his tia elsy 😍🥺
We need that documentary fs!!! Elsy will come out if this even stronger ❤️‍🔥
Love this podcast ! Can’t wait to see the documentary of elsy❤️
This was a great podcast! We all miss you guys filming together! ❤️. You all are so genuine and such a good people with a good vibe! 🥰
Benny came thru with giving a mic to Elsy… I can finally hear her ❤️ lol…., iykyk 😉 love you guys ❤️
My mom was a single mom (I'm married now without kids) and I've always had the same single mom fear. I'm sure it stems from us seeing our moms struggle. It's definitely not an easy task, props to you Elsy. 💕
Elsy is a good girl ! It’s sad that he is making her look this way ! Benny good job on keeping her positive!
You guys are so positive, love to see it 💗💗
I miss elsy & alondra together please start posting more ❤️
I think the documentary of Elsy is a great idea. There is so much we can all relate to. Her and how she grew up.
Okay but Benny is that guy! Wow I’m happy there are humble and kind men out in the world like him. Alondra about to propose LMAOOO
That would be amazing for a documentary like that
I feel that Elsy will overcome this. She would do anything for her daughter and HER only. She does not need to prove anything to anyone.  And to all those negative trolls, worry about what's going on behind your doors.
stay positive elsy and your doing great. keep your head up regardless since you are doing what is best for your daughter
Bennys hair looking fire! Christian left you looking good! Elsy, my heart goes out to you, hopefully this gets resolved soon! I love seeing baby Ehlani with you.
I would love to know what Bennies reaction was when he was editing the video and he realised his mic had died  half way through the podcast 👀
We all know we all came to watch this video to see how elsy got arrested 🤣🤣❤️
Alondra is a good friend ” when she’s happy I’m happy” that shows a lot and the friendship they have❤️
yes, show us the documentary! I look up to Elsy and I know so many other mommies do too. 💖
The documentary is a must !
I for sure want to see elsy documentary
Esly does not have to explain NOTHING about HER life. That's her business & her life. I think she is an amazing woman. And she's being more mature about the situation unlike her ex. He's an immature douch bag.
Elsy’s personality reminds me so much of my own, very private and not quick to badmouth someone else. What’s done in the dark always comes to light and the people with the good heart win ❤️ wishing alllll the best for her. Seems like she’s an amazing person and mother.
This video makes me like them all so much more then i already did. Feels so personal! Deff more videos like this plzzzz
Great episode. I would be honored to watch a documentary on Elsy’s life. I think that these podcasts really help us get to know everyone a little more. It’s good to see and hear. Elsy is being wise to ignore the speculators and not say too much even though it is tempting. There is definitely so much more to the story. We don’t see everything. Keep healing, keep growing, and don’t give up!  You’ve come a long way and the journey is not over!
SOY ELSY 69! FIRST DAY OUT BABYY
Dang alondra got papa laying flat with that bottle sheeesh!! Love yal tho ❤️
This is such a real ass video. Like so deep and powerful
Love how much growth you can see with these 3. Parenthood evolves us! Much love and blessings to all you 🤍
This is real content
Elsy: am I the drama ? I don't think I'm the drama ! 😂😂😂💀💀💀  But I'm team Elsy all the way!!!  I hope everything works out for her!  I can't wait to see the documentary Benny makes about her💖
I love how elsy seems more happier now as she should ❤️
Benny says you’re “known” for that. NO that’s not true. We love Elsy for her and who she is and her fashion business. Yet he makes a video to get click bait about her “drama” and yet says “shit I don’t want to be associated to this wtf” … rude! Not sure why he was rude to her throughout this video.
Yesss F what people say! Love you guys ❤️ Your a great mother Elsy we all know ❤️
This was such a deep and meaningful video. You can really see how genuine Benny is and how humble Elsy is. Love this
please post more vids of u 3!!!!!
Elsy is so strong  and keeping it together for her beautiful bby E ❤️
love this trio
I can’t wait to see Elsy documentary! Hurry up Benny get them editing skills to work when y’all finish recording!
‘’ i am the drama ‘’ 😂😂
Yess on the documentary
Panchito “guallavera” 😂😭
I can’t take Benny’s commercial breaks seriously 😂😂 i love them😆
You can really see and hear the pain in elsy just speaking about this custody thing and being a single momma. I really hope everything works out for her and baby E 🥺
Awww did anyone realize baby Benny smiling at elsy when she was talking at 4:10
Omgggg imagine if the officers knew her!?!? 😂😂😂😳
Yess!!!!!! We want elsys documentary  and alondras life story
Elsy just looks soooo much happier!! And Okay now we definitely need Alondras story!!
Stay strong Elsy ❤️ Prayers for you and your baby 💗 And alo and Benny many blessings ❤️❤️❤️
Yesss! We love this trio! Elsy, thanks for sharing your experience and what your really going through. All I do know is that you doing GREAT MOMMA. 🤍🙌🏼
don’t worry elsy, anyone who takes their time to watch your videos can see your genuine personality a mile away!!
Im sorry but Alondra is looking so beautiful she has a diffrent glow 💗💗💗
Yessss I want the whole Novela 😅😂🤣 lmao !
We need Nestor , Beau & Benny next episode!
We want a whole Netflix series about Elsy!
Elsy and alondra are like that ex that leaves without explanation and shows back up like “heyyyy big head” 🤪 and we’re just here like 😍🥰 😂
Chris does not approve of this wingman moment 😂
Yes!!! I would love to see this documentary Elsy, and not just to be nosy but because alot of us can relate to parts of your life.
Awesome Episode. Elsy you are a wonderful single Mom. You are a beautiful soul. I can relate to you being a single mom going through a similar situation. Hang in there girl. Benny and Alondra you guys are awesome friends.❤❤❤💯
Awe I would absolutely live to see a documentary of Elsy's life!! And I think that would be great for her to open up more and get over certain things in her life that she hasn't yet. And Benny that is so awesome you're doing documentaries!!
I would love to see the documentary of elsys life ❤️
Yessss to the documentary! That would be dope!
Elsy should make a documentary 🥰
😭💔 when bennys mic cuts off  whyyyyy si estaba bueno  en el chisme
The video I been waiting for 😍😍😍 Nestor should be your next person in the show
More elsy video
As a mother who can relate to Elsy , I feel like it’s very important on how to speak to our kids overall. It truly affects them emotionally and mentally… it would be great to hear how you’re educating yourself on how to speak to your daughter about a situation for the near future. Possibly books? Mom blogs? …It’s all great to hear from another mom who has been through a nightmare and is overcoming it little by little . Great video
much respect to her! She’s been through so much and she’s still able to have such a genuine personality. I would love to see a documentary of her life, whenever she’s ready. Todo a su tiempo 🧡
❤️❤️❤️❤️😊😊 finally with elsy ive been waiting
Wow that’s a real best friend !!! She pushed you to success Alondra
Elsy is my absolute favorite I love her sm

I want to see Elsys documentary please do it!!
I love elsy so much I can relate to her pass life story and present I’m not no mom but seeing that and growing in that life style with my mom a siblings I’ll never wanna go back like she said I wanna be great and become a star for my mom and siblings where we’ll never get to struggle or be traumatized again , I’m alway grateful thank you elsy for putting your personal life around social media even though it’s hard you’re a positive strong women and mother & it opens doors for others
I thought he was going to shout out CristianBlends for the haircut not Blenders 🤣🤣🤣
I love the Friendship  that alondra and Elsy have 💕 just like that TikTok Hahha that says gurls girls girls best-friendsssss forever ❤️ love them!🥰
Yes to documentary !!
Respectfully want to give some un-asked for advice to momma Alondra, and i promise I’m saying this with a big heart and pure intentions. It’s best to feed the baby a little more sitting up than laying down and the bottle should be straight, like horizontally. To prevent from choking and better digestion.. love you all so much
Lowkey those microphones look like shower heads Benny!!!😂😂😂
I would love to watch that documentary i would be watching it over and over again like Netflix got nothing on this 😭
This episode is hella lit😍 loving the sound effects and you guyss♥️

I can relate with elsy on never wanting to be a single mom and now I’m a single mom of 3 and it’s so hard But I am trying to keep myself positive and I hope nothing but the best for her ♥️
Wish it was just Benny and Elsy in this podcast so it can be a true podcast that is focus on Elsy. No disrespect to Alo. 💕
My 3 month old son just fell asleep watching this with me 🥺 he loves these videos 💙
I love to see how successful she is🤗 I went to school with Elsy and her personality and humor is still exactly the same🤍    The meme’s though ( elsy’s “bitches be like caught of guard” meme )
Yes the documentary will be so interesting and I feel like us can all relate ❤️
Not Benny calling you guys out about not posting 😂😅 we love you guys anyways!!
Definitely want to see the documentary!!!
Alondra didn’t understand the assignment 😭😂😂😂😂😂
