3:36 she has a point tho, thats why i haven't shaved in a looooooong time lol, if a abrupt "event" comes up i need to explain this logic lmfao
“My dong hole and my wrong hole” my lord that was not anything I expected from these sketches
"Now, see, that really rips my nips..."
shouldn't the music have been CE3K rather than 2001?
Pubic hairs like trees.. 4:56
I never laughed so hard!!!!!
😂😂😂😂❤
It would have been amazing if Kate and Kristen started at the same time.
Bittersweet ending for her snl run. I hated to see her go.  I got more laughs from her than any of the others.  😢
wasnt expecting it to almost make me cry
Love you Kate!❤❤❤❤❤
They ran this skit into the ground.
That's the best farewell to an act I've ever ever seen. 💯💥🇦🇺🤙
I don't càre what people think but Kate is in the top 5 funniest people on SNL
I'm hoping this isn't the final one.
She's so funny.... legendary SNL comedian.
I was actually sad they took her 😒
Thank you great stuff
the one with Goslin was so EPIC !
That was Cool.
My curly’s have become the must have item of the season 😂😂😂😂😂 FUUUUUCCCCCCKKKKKKK LOL
WHHHHAAAATTTTTTT ???? 😂😂😂😂
Oh...I had'nt seen how they wrote her off the show- I wen't from laughing so hard -I could'nt breath- to tearing up- when she had tears in here eyes- as she waved and said goodbye---!- how appropriate-for such a talent!🥲🤣
"My Dong Hole and My Wrong Hole". Now that is funny.

Hairy Squatter.
When the cast for a movie, the writers join in… I cannot imagine the 2-3 weeks of abdominal pain from laughing the script together.
Donghole and wronghole will be my favorite synoym from now on!
God, I almost feel bad for Kate having to smoke so many of those nasty fuckin' prop cigarettes; if you think real cigarettes are disgusting, whatever shit they use for these fake ones are ten times worse. Did you ever hear about Jonah Hill getting sick from all the fake cocaine he had to snort in The Wolf of Wall Street? I was a pack a day smoker for a decade the first time I had to smoke one of these fakes and it made me puke!
That was the best exit ever. 😢
Why are you placing the words over the skit? We can understand them perfectly.
So nice that they gave her a solo "live from NY..."
We miss you Kate.
I so wish that after the door closed you got one more line from her saying, " Easy, easy!!  Give it a few days and the shelves will be restocked!"  🤣
Thanks for all the laughs!
one of their best skits
I laughed so hard at these ms rafferty sketches that I forgot the terrible wkend I had.😅 TY Kate McKinnon. Please give us more
“Pentagon has always been my favorite shape. So this is a real treat for me” deserved more applause
Kate McKinnon makes me laugh so hard my damn chest hurts🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I bet she was an inspiration for many rising comedians - male and female!
Yeah she is fuckin funny as hell just imagine if was in the old episodes that would have funny
Yep. Watched that one on the nite it aired. Sad moment. I didn’t know Kate was leaving, but it sunk in the minute she stepped in that doorway . . .
My favorite barbie
Looks like Agent Morris needs to be put on a strict diet ASAP.  That a heart attack waiting to happen.
"pubically, it's a jungle down there" and "that fortune teller was dead on!" are too of the greatest lines in the history of sketch comedy
Dance that fortune was right😭😭😭😭
These abduction videos are too funny. Cowbell was funny but these make me roll.
"Why clean house if no one's coming over?" EXACTLY
“No need to clean the house if no one’s coming over.. if you know what I mean”😅😂
That fortune teller line had me.
KATE will be so missed from SNL!  🎉😂❤
SNL just another reason why I wish I was American. You people are truly amazing. Whatever is going on at the moment, the cultural legacy you have given the world never be equaled.
How can anybody dislike this skit?!!
Someone has to do a animated version of this it would be so awesome
She will be forever and always my favorite snl member ever
There’s camel toe, there’s moose knuckle, and then there’s this denim slot canyon Kate is sporting.😳
First time she enters the alien craft with her pants on 😂
This is in my top "goodbye" sketches for the handful of cast members that got a goodbye.  Phil Hartman's "Sound of Music" tribute, Kristen Wiig's graduation sketch, Will Ferrell's with Tracy badmouthing him,  Jimmy Fallon's Grease parody, Andy with "Lazy Sunday 2" and Cecily's last update piece (Cecily actually got two goodbyes) are in my favorites of these.
its criminal to do this skit without gosling and very sad that she left the show
She belongs up there with the original noy ready for prome time players. A true treasure. Love Miss Rafferty.
Why do we not see her in movies?
That is one of the best "fairwells" SNL ever had.
That was an iconic and sad exit❤
Me too
It think Kate just experienced a Diddy Party.
The big girl there, got busted drunk driving not long back. She is a weapon !
Funny
Her best character in my opinion 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Gonna miss her a lot. She was the S in SNL. It's gonna be hard to find a replacement for her. Love you Kate and thanks for your unique sense of humor.
The only thing that could have made that funnier would be to have the greys fiddling the cooch cooch and dragging her off
Kate McKinnon bringst to life some of the greatest characters, on SNL and in film. She's wildly gifted.
Cheri Oteri would be a great great addition to being Kate's friend in these skits!!
Lady in the middle was a miscast. She just wasn’t funny and couldn’t hold her own
That was class as well as classic
Actually teared up at the end 😢 Kate MacKinnon was one of my faves, she's dearly missed ❤
best one yet, the writing was top shelf, "i got more hair poking out the sides than a hipster's beard stuffed into an n-95"   i lost it.   "look, i'm not proud of it, but hey, why clean the house if no one's coming over, right?"
Being that that was her last episode, totally brought tears to my eyes because of all the amazing work that she did through the years!
i cried when she exhaled. we lost and won. thank you so much kate. in our hearts forever
What a LEGEND - MacKinnon Forever
Sadie Adler.
My yeasty and my beasty 😂😂
I have no idea how Kate McKinnon stays in character. Whoever thought up these sketches is a genius. I wish they had made more of them! The writing here is just fantastic.
It is so funny to make light of alien abduction. The way these demon beings take children and experiment on them all their lives, so funny. Then they implant them, return them, but some of them dont return. Yeah, it's so funny. You can find out if you have been taken with an electronic Studfinder with a new battery.  The implants are just under the skin and are magnetic. A small Neodymium magnet, like from an earbud, will stick to your Forehead where an implant is located. The better earbuds magnets work best, cheap ones, not so much. If the pole of the magnet is opposite the implant, it will repel the magnet. NS! The implant is a transmitter and gives off a radio signal, so I guess that is how it works. I have found that most people who have been abducted have 2 or 3 implants in the Foreheads.The implants are all over your body, the Head, Torso, and Legs and Arms, and yes, even the Groin. Isn't that so f-ing funny.
Not me crying for like hours after this
❤
kate you make me laugh so hard my dong hole got separate from my A hole
This should have been the last sketch of the episode, not the cold opening. Guess this was a bigger deal than whatever was in the news at the time.
I dont believe ive ever seen anybody else consistently break other players and pros like Kate. ❤
Absolute genius and game changer. A force of unstoppable nature. She did so much for women ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Double barrel pink doesn’t sound too pleasant
That has got to be one of the best exits of a character that I have ever seen in all my 46 years😂😂 that woman is hysterical we were lucky to have her 🩵💜🤗
I haveno idea how any of them kept a straight face and stayed in character. That was LOL riproaring hysterical.
Fricken funny always go back to this...major league  🤣
The lady with the cigarette is hilarious 😂 😅😂Such a lady👑
Thanks for the laughs!😂
Kate is truly supreme.❤😂😅
kate mckinnon is so great at trying to break people before she breaks herself.  wish ryan gosling showed up for this one
I had tears in my eyes...
Thanks to Video job for making my life better💸
"with my dong hole and my wrong hole"................
The more of these I watch, I see why it showed after children should be in bed! The content, oh wow!
Kate is a brilliant comedian- I watch these videos over and over again and laugh SO hard EVERY time!
That girl was made for comedy
"Why clean the house if no one is coming over."
Some of the best since the early 80s❤
I feel it  HARD TOO XPLAN
My rebirth I’m with the eyes
We’ll miss you Kate ❤❤💔 but why are the aliens always sexually abusing her though? 😂
Kate is hella funny
Lucie Arnaz did a satanic ritual on me. Her granddaughter was a part of the satanic ritual. Her granddaughter(the youngest granddaughter who is Delores Cannon) did witchcraft on me before she was born.
I need Zach competing with her in this style of sketch with a normal person who lied about the experience reacting
❤🎉❤😂🎉❤😂🎉😢😂❤😢
Somewhere there's a sketchpad full of "donghole-wronghole" euphemisms that we as a planet desperately need in our lives.
Bring Kate back!!!!
"I had more hair poking out the sides..than a hipster's beard stuffed in an N95"! Literature folks 😍
Kate all the best from your biggest fan in the U.K ❤
Totally disgusting. SNL shows their true colors. Debase and stuck on sexual and bathroom humor.
So my yeasty and my beastie are in full view 😂
2025 a new sketch just comes 😁👍🏻👍🏻👽👾🤖
Can we talk about Cessaly & Kate wearing the same costtume in each of these skits
For some reason the little gray aliens showing up at the end was so touching to me. I cannot tell you why.
Iconic SNL cast member❤❤❤
I feel like Cecilia didn't like being next to kate during these skits.
Miss you Ms.Rafferty and your 🚬
Never thought I would cry at the end... what a legend she is ♥♥♥
Yeah!, here’s my issue with Kate, I first saw this skit while waiting for my daughters to arrive, I spewed beer from my nose and pissed myself!!! I was at TGIF. Fair warning don’t watch any Kate McKinnon skits if you are in public…you will piss yourself.
Well….. a little different for me
She is the best ❤
Bring back Kristen Wiig!  Now, she was funny! Kate is funny too
Why clean the house when no ones   coming over!! 😅
was this her last gig? She got so emotional at the end.
I have never once watched SNL, just recently YouTube clips but Kate McKinnon, if you ever somehow see this; you are an all-star from clip viewers to dedicated fans. Thank you
Special comedian.  Thanks for all the laughs 😂
Wish they had gotten Gosling back for this final edition. Great sendoff for Kate nonetheless.
did NOT expect to end up weeping irt an snl bit tonight. damn. time to rewatch more of her, what a fuckin legend
the first one was great.
I saw this. I'd forgot about it all together. Kate absolutely is in the top 3 greatest cast members on SNL.
Awe!!!! 😭❤😭❤
How the hell did they turn THIS concept into an emotional sendoff? Well done!!
If there is another MiB movie this character should be there
Extraterrestial Horn Dogs ?
Why clean the house if no one’s coming over… KC I cried so hard at that one
No, obviously not.  😂
Can’t figure why it’s always us southerners who encounter this stuff
Kate McKinnon is amazing ❤️.
At least this time, she has her pants.
It is so unique and so original to see another comedienne make a skit about how lascivious she behaves.  And then the best part, the coup de main!  It has to have a punchline about how nasty and unkempt her vagina is.  That's the only way for a woman to pretend to be funny in the 21st century, and if you can say vile and disgusting things in a girly voice, that is even better!  It has to be something the Democrat Party allows you to joke about.  If the DNC can't tell you what is funny, then you have to be offended on behalf of a marginalized group.  That is hilarious!
Literally in tears right now 😢
Apparently she just lives on a farm and grows vegetables. She spoke about it on drew barrymore show and she's in peace and happiness.
She’s PRICELESS🤣🤣right up there w/Lucille Ball funny & physically funny😂 I Love Her❤
Im sorry but “dong hole and wrong hole” is entering into my everyday vernacular.
I swear, if this don’t make you laugh something’s wrong with ya’!
Hillarious ❤🎉
she's the female version of Dana Carvey, bravo Kate
5:04 Damn, That future teller was dead on
3:26 In a decade (hopefully) no one will get this joke! 😂
That fortune teller was spot on lol😂
"My Dong Hole & My Wrong Hole"! Ms. Rafferty was THE ONLY funny thing on SNL throughout the last 10 years! It's unbearable. Time to cancel!
no one remembers me 😇😇
BEST SHOW EVER IF YOU SEE JACK HANDEY FROM EASTWOOD TELL HIM THANKS YOU SAVED THE WORLD @ GOLDEN 50. 45150 ARCHANGEL CMD CNTR NEW YORK 🙃🙃👁👁💄💄🐄🐄🦄🦄🐿🐿😇😇🛸🛸😎😎👂👂🥳🥳🖖🖖
A proper send off for a legend. Although she deserved an etire episode dedicated to her and her amazing characters. I hope wherever she is she's happy and content alongside her beautiful family.
First time she gets aboard with her pants on!
Love Katie 😍 she is hilarious!! Seriously, one of the best on SNL
It sounds like the difference between being married and being single . Either way .
but hey , why clean the house if no ones coming over right 😆
This is the best skit! It always makes me cry.
Not the same without Ryan sorry
Her Donghole & her wronghole!!!🤣🤣🤣
Lloré de la risa
She is the best
You can read her face to see how much she loved doing this honestly she is ICONIC
Why clean the house when no one's coming over is just so real and funny.🎉🎉😂😂
Final encounter is just the funniest
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
This is so disgusting is hysterical LOL!!!
Why clean the house if nobody's coming over.😅
I'm here watching these things in 2024 knowing damn well this stuff is so real now. Funny as he'll I watched them all over past few years. Kaye with gosling was the best! Her Hilary Clinton with Donald Trump (baldwin) rules.
And than early 2024 skit she somehow ended  up on earth again with ryan gosling character
If a man did half the sh!t Kate McKinnon did in all these sketches......
SNL Legend
Aidy with her one expression that she's capable of making...
DONG HOLE and WRONG HOLE 😂😂😂😂😂😂
It took me a hot second to process “my dong whole and my wrong whole” The way I broke down wayyy to late
The fortune teller 😂😂😂😂
They should take the middle one
mikey day is such a hero for never breaking
The umpire yelled timeout. 😂
... I'm not proud of it, but hey, why clean the house if no one's coming over...😅
Wow! Emotional
Stuffed inna N-95 image can now be appreciated by ALL because of that ChineseFlu.
This is maybe the best series of skits I've ever seen on SNL or MAD TV. Laughed my ass off.
Everyone’s crying n shit I’m still laughing this chick is too fn much I’m suprised this is first time I seen this
Not the most embarrassing thing I've done a jumbo tron 😂😂😂
5:46 If I could get halfway up those jeans as far as those jeans get up there, I would be a happy man.  Luh you McKinnon.
7:53 Beeeeeeee aver Goood
I hope she comes to visit every once in a while 🥹
BRO I FUCKING CRIED 🥹😭
Lol, “my dong hole and my wrong hole.”
I watched the first ever Saterday Night, back in the seventies.  Kate has been one of the funniest ever.  All these years later.
I lost it at the end
She needs to return its her home
Classic example of comedy
Screaming 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Not me over here sobbing 2 years later.
2024?😘
The moment I realised Kate was gone for good was like watching Jordan take his final shot as a bull.
Been watching SNL for decades, watching many send offs as a kid, not grasping the depth of someone wonderful leaving the show... until now. We'll miss you, Kate!
I am extremely confused why the crowd would go insane after one single line that wasn't even a joke.
👏👏👏
What happened next.. the umpire called time out
She said prune shoot😅😅
Great writing.  These girls could pull it off perfectly.  Kate is a treasure.
Kate was always so funny!
"The umpire called time out" 😂 legendary  Love that they showed the aliens 😍  So touching that she was emotional at the end 😢
Natasha Lyonne being the host just felt right
i love that muffin meat
Indeed, after Kate's departure, watching SNL does feel like havin ya pubes plucked one by one, in a torturous way. Beam us up Kate, please!
🥺
I feel sorry for Miss Rafferty! She has experienced alien abductions, paranormal encounters, Christmas miracles! No wonder she looks insane.
Look I’m not proud of it but hey why clean the house if nobody’s coming over right?
Kate is brilliant.
Frickin great 😂😂
i cant 😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤ But seeious the fuck. lol i found gold 😂😂😂
Hilarious 😂😂😂
I love Kate, especially on these skits.
My bush hairs became a 'must have'! Bahahaha!
Kate is always the lamest part of these.
Love her
Cow Bell redux
Agent lipzippens
Well hello once again 😂
I totally thought the aliens would start playing with her knockers. Missed opportunity.
Dong hole and my wrong hole lmfao😂😂😂
One o f the best of snl ever
she was crying😢 right then i wanted to give her a hug. ❤❤
Definitely bi women
My husband showed/shared these with me I miss him dearly 😢
Weird Barbie lol
Colleen! Hahahahahahaahaua
Damn! That badsss chick from orange New black!
WOW!!!😊💌😊🥰😊❤️😊                       🇺🇦
I miss Kate and Cecily ❤😢😢😢😢
Hey why clean the house when nobody is coming over?  I’m dead 😂😂😂
Kate steals the scene...marvelous.
fat is never funny
Dong hole and wrong hole. lol
This ending is so touching!
WE MISS YOU KATE!!!!!❤
She is so damn funny!   "My down there hair!"
Very talented and smart comedic lady
some of the worst commedy ive ever encountered, worse than a Nigerian soap opera, wtf writes this sh1t?
Definitely one of my favorite skits. Ironically it was created/played by the woman who ruined SNL. Kate’s reaction to 2016 election killed SNL. A skit without a joke. Ruined.
Oh Kate and Aidy,  miss you so much 😢❤
She would be FUN as a babysitter telling stories 😂😆 ❤ The way she paints the picture, hahaha... A nasty one.
SNL could rehash all these old funny skits! Better then the crap they've been doing.
❤her emotions are so genuine here❤ What a talent
They let her keep her pants.
I like 🐒🐒
Awww she got ch9ked up a lil. Kate we LOVE YOU GIRLand THANK YOU!
The encounter skits became my FAVORITE SNL skits solely because of Kate……….. I’m so glad I have a way to watch them whenever I’m feeling nostalgic 🥰
Natasha Lyonne sucks at acting.
One of the top 20 skits in SNL history... IMHO
Did she leave the show? Or just stoped the sketch?😊❤
Genius
What about bikini season?
I thought that was awesome loved her exit from SNL
Omg forgot how dang funny these are!!!
Kate is a badass!! What a master class on soup wording and performance! Hats off!
So happy for her. Godspeed, Kate. 🫡
"Why clean the house if nobody's coming over"  now you know your married
How do they think this stuff up
Me too me too... Sis...
I’m so glad she came back when gosling hosted a few weeks ago
03:25 best Covid-19 joke I have ever heard!
My dong hole 😂
Need an animated series of the grays slapping her knockers
I would pay to see Kate and Cheri Oteri in a skit
This is great. Kate's Jeff Sessions was my favourite character of hers. Amazing
Pubically speaking.............🤣🤣🤣🤣
"That's the most stable relationship I've ever had." I understand; and I feel the same way about my shrink! 😔😅
Why clean the house if no ones coming over 😂😂😂
bring her back... just pick up from when the door closes.... have it open back up...they  throw her out..... cuz they didn't recognize her with her pants on!!
Such a tear jerker.  And free bikini waxes for eternity.
i Love HeR!
Kate McKinnion is SOOO good at this!! Her skits/characters are iconic and unforgettable
"Why clean the house when nobody's coming over" 😂😂😂
Kate, we miss you. These were your finest hours. So far, at least.
Why hasn't Hollywood given this woman a starring role?? There's no way she wouldn't be the next Jim Carrey.
Very cute
The aliens must have been confused by seeing her in pants
😂😂😂😂😂
SNL has to bring her back as the ALIEN QUEEN,
I was so sad last year when they announced this as the final one, but I just watched a new one from last night!!
Quality cold open
Obviously not
A year later and its still hurts
Not exactly.
I want this sketch and her character to have a movie so bad
this was amazing... she is so awesome..... but her doing Justin Bieber is my favorite ever....  she killed it....  love this woman.
Nooo obviously noooot…! 😂😂😂😂
SNL’s best days are long gone
Thank you Kate, thank you for leaving us with gifts like, "My Pink Pocket and my Stink Rocket" and my new favorite, "My Dong Hole and My Wrong Hole" you were amazing!
Dong hole and wrong hole????
A swift reba and a judd walk into a bar
She needs to be on Last One Laughing
My dong hole & my wrong hole! Lmfao!!! 🤣 🤣
the doctor strange refrance was brialliant
Wow, that was not funny.
I have been missing this skit and I’m so glad it showed up again ❤
I think I musta watched a couple episodes of this show over my 70 years of life.  Didn’t realize the show was SO FUNNY 👩🏻‍🏫👵🏻😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🥰‼️
SNL is still funny when they not playing politics
This is probably the funniest skit i I've seen  in a while
They will never be another Kate
“Dong-hole and wrong-hole hanging out all at once…”
Angel is now playing the Victim Cards ... Name a card of victimhood and Angel owns it. Last year Angel was shoutin in people's faces now she is the bullied victim .......  What a liar
This is so hillarious!
Kate is one of the top ten, most effortlessly funny people, ever, on SNL.
Kate sucks. Look at me acting!
too funny!
Such 🤔 quality??
Like she was telling the truth she really was crying and from the heart
anywhere on the east coast we are fucked in a nuclear war r
Does it do porn
why clean the house if no one is coming over
Gotta love her slang terms...lmfao
lol I love how her privates are always out
Dang, I teared up at the end.❤
😂🏳️‍🌈🚩🐕🦮🐕‍🦺🐋🐬
To funny
I sure miss Ryan Gosling on this - nothing against Natasha Lyonne - but I loved how he couldn't keep a straight face. I had to replay it a few times just to hear it all because I was crying so hard!😂
I have seen Junkx Monsoon impersonate Natasha Leonne to the point I actually forgot it was not Ms. Leonne herself.  It was on a Snatch Game challenge on RuPaul's Drag Race.  A bunch of SNL cast members have been judges on DR.  Some mighty talented improvisational comedians on DR.  Mighty talented performers period.  Hard to see Kate go but we'll survive.  I wish her everything she wishes for!
Brava Queen Kate!! I started bawling 😭 soon as she turned toward the audience. You are an SNL icon!!! Thank you for being so amazing!
Kate...you are a legend!  All the best her and her future endeavors!
Kate is absolutely hilarious 😂
If you didn’t cry at the end of that man I feel for you
Both SNL originals Chase and Murray didn't think women could be funny, or cut it on SNL. I guess along with Curtin and BabwaWaWa this pretty much puts that idea to outer space.
Middle chick is a SHIT actress.
The aliens should have batted her fun bags when she stepped in the door.
Aidy has such beautiful hair.
How is it that people think this trash is funny? It is just not good.
Dumb question..... why'd she leave?
The level of comedic genius in the  similes and metaphors that Kate constantly fires off in these "Abducted" skits is amazing.
These two are hanging out with dr strange and multiverse and i am stuck with the madness Lmao
Anyone else notice they are wearing the same clothes in all 3 of these Alien Abduction skits? lol
I love her preferences  The funniest S**T
Had me laughing like old Saturday Night Live
I don't know which is better: this sketch, or the ending to close encounters.
They should of got Ryan in for the last one👽😢
She wasn't in character as she turned around, and I think that's what got us all
Old SNL would've let her take her jeans off and board the space craft with a giant bush poking out to close a decent joke. I guess that might've offended the pubic challenged community?
Seriously helps my depression I need  the laugh .! Thank you 😂
"Karlene,  this might be the most stable relationship you ever had"😂😂😂😂 gets me everytime.
The middle girl isn’t funny like the guy in the middle was.
She has got to be one of the funniest female comedians out there. She owned every skit she was in.
😂😂😂😂😂 pentagon is my fave shape too girl😂😂😂😂😂
"Why clean the house, if nobodies coming over" 😂
I didn’t realise this was a new rendition, loved it ❤
I can't believe they did the same sketch four times
Sad to say…I wore Kate’s outfit in the 80’s. Camel toe was unavoidable in those jeans.😳
Wheres ryan? Fuck this sketch.
All I see on SNL are only the pics You Tube shows.    Frankly WOKE shows are proof the world is ending soon.
Outer space is the greatest place but it's made in a Hollywood basement
Hahaha with her dong hole and her her wrong hole out killed me 👽👍
Dong hole and my wrong hole 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Laughing and crying. Beautiful emotions for an amazing skit and an incredible actor.
Ngl, aliens plucking public hair would HURT, lol.
Welp, she finally went with her pants on.
5:52 is just right.  excellent looking jeans. and pose.
I’m not crying you’re crying
I'm just making this because it's comment #5001
The umpire called time out.  OMG that's funny.
She is without a doubt the funniest thing going! HAHAHAHAHA
Absolutely Hilarious.   Thank You Kate.  Maybe some Stand up ?   Love Your senses of Humor 👍
Who was in the middle?
I DONT FIND THIS FUNNY! I was abducted 9  years ago and it haunts my dreams. They FORCED myself and my 3 friends to have an orgy with a giant praying mantis... ill never enjoy another gangbang ad long as i live, the trauma is too deep...
🥷
Make the movie now
Legend
Thank you so much. I'm laughing my a** off and sending it to everybody. I know this is so funny
kate mckinnon is the last great SNL cast member
Is there an snl without kate?
Kate looks more and more like Hillary Clinton every time I see her
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂She's hilarious
I'll simply say...!.."THANKS 😂!!!!!"!
The Pentagon is my favorite shape
When SNL starts doing stuff like this, you know they're hurting.  Great character, but horribly overused.  Gotta milk that cow.
Agreed. So emotional. I didn't cry until she did. More journeys ahead for her. So amazing!
😂😂😂😂😂faf
The funniest nickname she uttered was my drainer and stainer. Lol.
I sure hope this isn't actually the last one, it's gotta be my favorite ongoing sketch that SNL has ever done. They are just so dang funny, I always bust a gut. They gotta do it if she a host or guest again.
Hey, y'all. Who's that broad in the middle? I ain't  never seen her nowhere before. Oh well, never you mind. I's just glad we gots to see Miss Raferty again.  Cheers, you legend!
She is one of funniest women !! She reminds me a lot of Gilda !
Hopefully we don’t have to wait 25 years for another funny cast member. Like last time.
We need a movie where she and Zach Galifianakis play a couple living in Florida.
The original close encounter SNL skit she did was extremely funny
"My yeasty and my beasty" 😅😂😅😂 Legendary ❤
I think Pedro Pascal, Kate McKinnon & Timothee Chalamet need to be featured every season. ❤
She should have said "Thanks for the fish".
Middle chick ruined it
Wonder wear haha. If you saw then you would wonder where they have been
Kate is up there with the greats!
I love Kate sm❤
Mikey's don't break face is hilarious!😂
Would’ve be funnier if the aliens at the end grabbed her by the knockers 😅
Everytime my wife is sad, she put this skit on. I love it that she calls her panties "skivies", my wife's dad used to call his same thing. Lol. Comedic timing is an A PLUS PLUS on this one, man, KM is so chock full of talent and laughs, we love her in our house. LOVE YA KATE! WISHING U GREATNESS FROM HERE IN OUT, you've given so many such smiles, thank you dear!
Kate is A BEAST!!!! WIFEY MATERIAL ❤💯
Kinda corny. Nobody gets to cold open their departure from the show. Idk, whatever
Remember when SNL was funny? I do. This sketch is just another lame attempt in a decade long line of cringe inducing attempts at comedy.
Well said
She did for SNL like she did for Ghost Busters. I guess comedy is subjective and I’m glad I wont be subjected to this skit anymore. There should be term limits for SNL cast. Make room for someone who’s funny. Kenan, buddy it’s time to move outa your mom’s basement. Please
❤wow great exit! Hard to forget❤
Oh man, it's such a shame this was the last sketch Kate was in as an SNL cast member. Kate, Aidy and Cecily were just the best. They gave the show so much over the last decade *applause til my arms get tired* Love you Ladies! Xxx
that natasha chick is NO TALENT
It's such a bonkers skit to go out on i shouldn't be tearing up lol
❤❤❤❤
This was great.  But bummed she didn't reprise the abduction skit. Would love  to see Ms. Rafferty tell us about her yeasty her beasty in full view.
I couldn't see her going out any other way. Thank you Kate. Love ya.
So  f'n funny
Great skit. I truly expected her pants to spontaneously combust exposing her sling ring and her fling ring
if there isn’t an alien landing skit tonight I will CRY
The first time they did this was amusing.  The other two were painful and repetitive.
Anyone else think Kate looks like Matt Damien.
"pubically speaking" LMAO! and when she goes " whaaattttt?" hahaha
I really wish SNL was still funny 😢
"Why clean the house when nobody's coming over?"  Is she a messie?
Kate and cecily need to come back the two most versatile and funny women snl has ever had
This series was literally my favorite ever
Lmao
Kate belongs in the SNL hall of fame!!!!!    i wish her ALL THE BEST!!!!!!     IM SURE THE ALIENS WILL HAVE LOTSA FUN WITH HER....👽👽👽👽👾👾👾
Epic.
@5:30 Kate McKinnon omg
She is hilarious
It’s just not the same without Ryan.
I've never cried at a cast member's last skit, but I shed tears for this one. we miss you, Kate!
And this week shes back hosting! (12/09/2023) and i truly hope that this character returns on Saturday night. Kate is a treasure.
Over the years SNL has gotten less entertaining. It's just retarded. And not funny
watching SNL as a child with my mother in the 80s was one of the few happy memories i have with her. to this day, we will knock on a door and just say "land shark" and lol. i love kate so much.
😂
Just when you thought this was the last time she’d be interviewed about another encounter, the aliens were kind enough to let her go and have Kate host SNL on December 16th, 2023.
She always loses her pants somehow
This performance by KM is hilarious
cmon no she cant be leaving SNL, she is all in one actor and no scence that she cannot act, and make the character hers. im gonna miss her alot...... 😍😇😪😥😢😭 my best wishes for whatever next path of career ur taking ahead. take care
Lol
The Ron White of female comedy
Kate is totally overrated
These bits just got worse and worse, don’t get me wrong the first one was my favorite then it just went downhill, I wish they would stop milking this bit.
By far her funniest performance 🤣🤣🤣  She went out with a bang for sure 💯
One of the rarest things on earth, an actually funny female comedian.
That was touching. She was one on SNL’s all time best.  Who knows. Maybe the aliens will return in the future and leave her behind.
THE ALIENS WON.    EARTH LOST.   GOODBYE DEAR LOVE❤
Kate is hilarious...this character cracks me up.
Fkn funny
I was crying laughing at this. Crazy funny.
Huge camel toe
Hairy squatter/ Harry Potter.😂😂😂
So darn funny!!!
SNL lost a genuine American Treasure when Kate left the show.
I think I'm in love. Colleen is what I've been looking for my whole life
That sounded like the kc va. Sf super bowl game i came to the bar in my pirate clothing
no... obviously not.
The best send off ever ❤❤❤❤
Kate holding back tears and then aliens pop out
Oh wow, I don't get to watch much TV or anything so I wasn't aware she'd wrapped up with SNL.  She and Bill Hader are my two favorite cast members in years by a long shot.  I cried with laughter ("Why clean the house...) and then emotion (at her exit).  Will definitely have to scour films now to see what she's up to.
The heck i didnt know she left. This character and her shenanigans have me cracking up bad in situations i cannot be seen laughing. She was exceptional, kept the show afloat.
LOVE it when Kate airs out the old clam
She needs her own show like Carol
"Dong hole and wrong hole"  Genius
This must be based on true events experienced by kate.....no way a person can make that shi# up.....she was telling the truth....no doubt about it....or, or sold her soul to the devil in exchange for the ability to deliver material with a comic genius that in either case....is "supernatural" lol. She has been blessed by the comedy gods who have blessed us also with Chris Farley, Richard Pryor, Charlie Chaplin and few others who are the great legends, the CHOSEN ones with talents that surely must have their existence explained only by and owed to divine intervention...i am impressed (-: or aliens....aliens also could accomplish this im not afraid to admit...They maybe  couold be responsible...no....no officer ive smoked no weed today, why did you ask me that?
The only good female comedians are the ones that are ego free....Gilda Radner....Kirsten Wiig....
How does she no crack up? Love me some Kate McKinnon!
This is supposed to be funny but in reality it's not! She's of course way out of line sexually...ha ha ha She was molested by the alien's!
The females are never heard from again when they leave SNL.
This was some of the best cast members hands down
She was one of the all time best cast members.
Awesome ending to her time on the show, hadn’t seen that before. 😊
✌️Out Kate u rock
Why clean the house if nobody's coming over...lol
Way late to this and had no idea this was her send-off. Started to suspect as she walked into the ship and then BAM emotions. Love to you Kate. Bring us so many laughs and joy.
Ahh, is that how she left. Why did she leave if she was so sad about it?
Jim so thoughtful to share your moms birthday with us all. Enjoy every moment you can with this special lady
There were only two women that made me laugh to the point I almost couldn't breathe. Kate McKinnon and Karen Dunbar.
Love Kate!
thanks kate only eddie murhy got me laughing like did
snl should idiot tgrump and his minions get elected the writers wont write
thanks for all memories
How will we laugh without her???
soooo funny awesom and sad one of the greats has left us lamo are ass offf.
So funny! Unfortunately, SNL hasn’t been funny in years. It needs to be cancelled.
I'll be checking Long Jhon  Silver's roof tops with hope to find her!❤
I was teary loosing Kate but a little more loosing cecily when she was Kathy Anne
Sounds like CNN ?
Snl can’t make me laugh any more. Unless I’m watching the oldies. Then I guffaw.
Kate is amazing,what a great asset to SNL
DAMN I MISS COMEDY😅😢😅😢😅😢😅😢
Miss ya Kate!
If only one of the aliens would have batted her knocker.😂
SO TRUE...THE CONVERGENCE PART.  "THE ARTIST USES LIES TO TELL TRUTHS"
I'm not crying, you're crying
Dong hole and mah wrong hole.
Never should've messed with this skit.... Natasha ruined this. The first 2 with Ryan are sooooo much more genuine and funny with his reactions and emotions.
She is hilarious.
Wow this made me cry😂😂😂😂
I always cry ❤ at the end. Bye bye Kate. U gotta come back ❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I always thought she is way too talented for Saturday Night Live.  I wish that they would restart MAD TV and have her be one of the cast members on that show.
I rarely watch anymore. I'm old so I remember the founding cast and Kate was on that level. When she choked up so did I.
Amazing cast member. She will be missed. RIP 😢
Why did I cry? 😭😭😭😭
“Why clean the house when no one’s coming over?” Hahaha and then she elaborates… I’m dying laughing 🤣 “my curlies are the must have of the season”
I saw this when it aired but felt it just watching again now. Kate in my very favorite sketch bit character of Hers. God bless Her and give Her a hug of appreciation from all of us.
This was so emotional but the redhead who’s name I can’t remember really just wasn’t funny at all honestly
Emotions, so many emotions.
Natasha and kate next to each other was the combination I didn’t know i needed😍😍
Kate you were amazing and we will never forget your beautiful and astonishing acting👌❤️‍🔥
Lol 😂 why clean the house if no one is going over! Kate you’re hilarious 🤣 you
Natasha Lyonne 🥰😍
I LOVE U KATE!!!!
Why clean the house if no one’s coming over  Priceless.
Barbie
Aw ❤
SNL has become so much better since they dumped the political agenda.
OMG!  That made me cry.  😢
Kate's outfit should be in the Smithsonian next to Mr. Roger's sweater and Archie Bunker's chair.  She is a National treasure and this character is an icon.
Funny shit, I liked it.
Why clean the house if no one is coming over.   May be the best line on show
When kate leave I almost cry😭 Cuz it's my first time to see her cry🥺
can someone please put together a list the names of her genitals?
These episodes  make me cry they are so fucking 😄
OF COURSE IT IS THE PENTAGON
Who gets to pick the outfits? That's some excellent work right there.
😂😅🤣😂😁😆
I can only hope that her pant racket and dongle jacket returns for another debriefing in future!
omfg ..ill have to use that one .. why clean the house if no one is coming over. .hahhaah
“My dong hole and my wrong hole” 💀💀💀
Beautiful, talented, and one of the funniest SNL members ever.    Thank you, Kate.
This must be the biggest mockery of all time for those that have truly experienced these horrible things 😑 everything is a joke until it happens to you 😞
The BEST skits!!! My absolute favorite
Best possible choice for the final show. I just feel like instead of her standing in the spaceship door to give her goodbye. They should have just kept it as a silhouette of Kate like it started, only with her then removing her pants before she stepped into the ship 😂
Sooo stupidly crude. Dumbed down trailer trash humor
The last days of SNL actually being funny
🙄
The most lab made new york girl ever attempting a southern accent was so beyond awful 😖
This is absolutely hysterical! I’ve watched a dozen times.
There are some SNL performers who can never be forgotten. I’ve been a fan from the beginning. Dan Ackroyd, John Belushi, Gilda Radnor, and now Kate!
Hm. Didn't this used to be a comedy skit show? I recall it had funny comedians doing creative and interesting bits and characters that were very funny.
If this ain't the person delivering the news from the government about the ALIENS confirmation... I don't want to hear it.  Missed Opportunity
Kate was so nasty
That great!!  It starts off like it's getting old, redundant, THEN KATE JUST TAKES OFF!! LMAO
That must have been her final episode
I saw this live. I thought it was impossible to laugh and cry at the same time....but an ICON proved me wrong.
I always clean the house no matter what
She's so very talented and funny.
fck im not crying, yu crying!
😂😂😂😂💚🙏
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Too long, not funny, FBI agent way to fat. Extremely sorry this hit my recommendations..
Kate's the funniest person bye far I wish she'd never stop doing this show ❤
Genius send off! Pun intended
So many good lines from this bit over the years, and still somehow the funniest to me is the word "slacks".
I can't believe there was still something entertaining on SNL.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Saturday Night Live has not been worth watching since the 80s. Today's Saturday Night Live is nothing but a bunch of woke morons.
She is a true Gem ❤
A perfect good bye
ANOTHER DEAD  NICOLE SIMPSON! KILL A BITCH JUST AS EASY AS A DUDE AIN'T AFRAID TO DO THE LORDS WORK!! 😐
I'm  bummed, I love this skit. 😢
Dong hole and wrong hole 😂
I haven't laughed like this in a long time, what a great skit for a great entertainer and actress.
Trashy video design strictly for inebriated high on drugs people.
Is it too much to ask for a Miss Rafferty movie-like the old days when SNL skits were made into whole movies? Come on-we need Kate and Ryan Gosling…
Fitz Simmons <3! Major Agents of Shield reference :D
yup
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This show must get government funding like PBS . There is no way anyone's watching this .
😂🤭
THE PENTAGON...
Kate McKinnon. All day. She is one of the funniest they ever had since the '70s. True talent, and absolutely hilarious
instead of plucking it sounded like something else with that "cigi" in her mouth.
THE AIR CONDITIONER JUST CAME ON IN MY HOUSE
When SNL has its next big anniversary reunion/special, an appearance by Ms Colleen Rafferty is a MUST. My dream SNL sketch is Ms Rafferty and Larry David's Bernie at a bus stop complaining to each other about their weekend. Larry wearing the Bernie coat and mittens outfit and Kate in her cameltoe jeans puffing on her cig. Bernie/Larry complaining about the early Fall chill While Colleen tells him about how she lost her sweat pants falling out of  a pine  tree with her grassy knoll and gassy hole exposed to the world.
THE INTELLIGENCE USA IS NAZI AND THEY ARE TOURING ME WITH MICROWAVES
THE INTELLIGENCE USA IS NAZI AND THEY PLACE TECHNOLOGY ON BRAIN AND BODY
God I love her. So funny.
Kate. Love you. Thank you for so much laughter over the years.
Aidy just cannot keep a straight face in these sketches. Lol. I love it.
BEST SNL Character ever!
So funny loved it
Probably the second best SNL performance ever.
Now that Natasha has stopped smoking, her voice is unrecognizably lyrical and feminine. It's UNREAL.
Down there hair  lmao😂😂😂😂😂
Omg this is SOOOO how it would be for me sucked off the toilet and down hill from there😮😮😮😮😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤
The final encounter one should’ve had Ryan Gosling 😂
That was one of the best send-offs ever!
Good times and a thing of beauty at the end. Congrats, Kate !
The umpire called time out!!! Hilarious.
Its cool she got her send off but it is sad that most cast members dont get proper goodbyes
Why clean the house if no ones coming over?
I thought it was a
3:26 lmaooo I’m dyinggggg
That’s unfortunate lmaooo
“My Dong Hole and my wrong hole” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 shes a savage
❤❤❤
That Doctor Stranger reference 💀
God I love Natasha Lyonne
Is Kate actually smoking? Has she developed a nicotine addiction?
I'm crying
Omg I didn't realize this was her final show. I was like WHY IS THIS EMOTIONAL and then her words got caught and I was like OMG
The only way Kate should have went out. What a Legend
There she is, Miss "BLUE JEAN 👖 🐫 CAMEL TOE CROTCH!" Wonder if she can get her "CAMEL 🐫 TOE" 2 puff on that cigarette?!  That'd B a neat trick. "PUFF the MAGIC 🎩 🐫 CAMEL TOE" lives by the Vee..." 😂😂😂
I'm a guy. Have to let all SNL viewrs know that the male cast members were often recognized while the women were noy. I have watched SNL beginning with episode #1.  Gilda Radner, Jane Curtain, anf Laraine Mewman were worth more than their weight in precios metals and gems. Gilda gave us Emily and Rosanne. Best of all, she destroyed Candice Bergen with one smile and took that skit whete she decided to go. Bergen was unable to speak. She was laughing so much she had to cover her face with a sofa pillow. I saw that live. It doesn't appear on the YouTube video. Keep rocking ladies. There are men who love you and all that you do.
Thank you Kate.  What a fitting send off.
They should have had the aliens bring her pee bowl out or bat at her knockers. She is an amazing actor and person.
Kate will go down as one of  the all time greatest on SNL.
Kate is the best.
“Dong hole and wrong hole” WINS 😂
She is for sure one of my favorite. Such a talented actress and wishing her all the BEST and Than you Kate for making me laugh!!!
When a comedian has ascended to such a level that she NEVER breaks and ALWAYS controls the crowd with absolute precision, she’s gotten everything out of SNL that an entertainer could. I’m so glad for Kate!!
legend, icon!
this send off is fucking beautiful!!
😄😄😄Kate is already missed.
Fitz Simmons!!!
Kate is the funniest woman alive.  Hope she'll get to do something worthy of her talents.
Lmao... "Why clean the house if no one's coming over."
WE LOVE YOU KATE ♥️YOUR FABULOUS ❤️
"Well Earth, I love ya, thanks for letting me stay a while."  Those words hit me harder than I expected.
Wait I just came here looking for my favorite Kate McKinnon alien skits and did NOT expect this ending. I love this character so much
Well, Kate, you did it. You killed SNL.
Love the 🐪 toe sweety you are so funny 🤣
Missing them all," 2023 now!
She was/is the stuff of legend….I would bounce on and off SNL..but when she was on I could never look away…..so very grateful for her comedic genius
The close encounter was 7 years ago?!!?!!?? Omg
I am sorry but Natasha Lyonne ain’t hittin the  Southern drawl right 😂 still love her though!!
One hell of an ending.
Finally she got abducted by 👽
Tht pubic pose puts me in  hard situation 🤣🤣🤣🤣 LOL
So, what did the Fortune Teller Tell her??? Btw: it's amazing how they kept the clothing For years.
It's that subtle crack in her voice and somberness in which she's says "Live from New York...it's Saturday night🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️" We all knew it was over😢
You can see the tears in her eyes she was an amazing edition to snl and is iconic and will always be one of my favorite snl ladies
Colleen Rafferty - Earth could not have chosen a better emissary to send to the aliens!
W!TH MY D😂NG H😂LE AND MY WR😂NG H😂LE HANG!NG 0UT...DAM SHE G😂T ME CRY!NG....
Fitzsimmons is hot.  I assume he is straight married with kids ?
Kate, Cecily and Aidy gave SNL heart and made me laugh more than anyone since the 90"s crew!
FIRST CLASS LADY N BUTIFULL
Should have brought back Coneheads or created a new alien species.
Your writers are comic geniuses.
That was the BEST ever, I must have watched this thirty times.....I hope she comes back!
Walken back and forth starring at my curleys
Are you kidding?  Shes the funniest cast member!  This was a bad decision SNL.
Awww no!!! We want Kate to stay 😭 you can hear she's about to cry too omg
Used to see Natasha walking around nyc like a drunk homeless woman years ago! Nice to see she back on track!
No disrespect to ALL the iconic characters that have graced the SNL stage but Mrs. Rafferty is my favorite one of them all! Glad we got 1 last laugh with her!
It will take a lot to top this.
I actually cried when I heard that Cecily was given the show up and then when I saw Kate McKinnon cutest little girl in the new in the world. She just the cutest all the character she can fight but Sicily sixty-two-year-old man I've been in love with you for years I hope nobody told you I hope it doesn't make you feel uncomfortable you are just an amazing woman your hysterically funny you're just a great Entertainer and I'm sure you're an excellent friend because of all the people in love that you had on Saturday Night Live and all the people live cast and the people that love you you're an excellent person may your future peat as bright as you could have ever imagined me you think you're in supernovae at all times have a great life I can't wait to see you alive
Wish they did lumee short
DAmmngg, I didn't know she was leaving the show. It would it be way too hilarious if one of the Aliens would slap one of her knockers, Lol....
Kate was probably the biggest send off on SNL & just recently Ms. Strong they will be truly missed by us all but it's not bad tho interesting to see were they take they career next
LONG LIVE MS. RAFFERTY! One of the best characters to appear on SNL. I was lucky enough to see the first episode of season one. She is impossible to replace. I look forward to whatever she does next. It seems impossible that it will be less than stellar. Perhaps Dr. We know this can inform us.
Why am I crying? Jajajajaja WTF jajajaja pure talent always make you emotional
Kate deserved far better than the abomination that was the Ghostbusters reboot.
The moment she turned back around, I felt that imminence. Saying goodbye for the final time.  There’s a certain sting that comes along with the feeling of “this made me happy, but it’s my time to say goodbye”that will always be difficult to describe.  But that face, made it crystal clear. Thank you so much, Kate.
Kate McKinnon was my gay awakening 😂

It's incredible how humor and weightiness fused at the end there!
Her tragic alien abduction stories make me laugh every time, no matter how many times I re-watch it.
Dong hole and wrong hole
The first time I’ve seen her break was at the very end of this skit  We love you Kate ❤
Was she in more sketches in this episode or just The cold Open
Had to come back here after Cecily’s last show…it’s still so bittersweet to me.
My yeastie and my beastie!!  Love it!!
Re-watching this in December of 2022. Kate McKinnon
This is so funny I can't stop laughing 🤣
Bravo.  ~_~
I'm Sarah in Project Bluebook at the USAF and I am laughing so hard about the character Mrs. Rafferty! Please do not stop writing shows on the Greys it makes me laugh so hard! Thank you!
The fact that she didn't lose her slacks on the way in is just wrong.
Excited to see what comes next for Kate ! She is so talented
Aidy, Cecily, Natasha and of course Kate. amazing, talented, hilarious women.
That lady is exactly like the women on my dad's side of the family.
That lady is exactly like the women on my dad's side of the family.
Make me cry why don't cha. Kinda rips my. Nips.
I feel so sad that Aidy was crying
Whyyyyy am I crying just as much as I did when I first saw this. :') she's awesome.
I need her to tell my boss why I'm late for work
AWEEEEEEEE I HAD NO IDEA THIS WAS HER LAST SKIT
One of my all time favorite skits over the years.
I freaking love this ! She's so funny
Just about every type of drink has come out through my nose over the years because of her.. "...My dong hole & my wrong hole..", "..my please hump it & my cheese trumpet.." "..My coot coot & my prune chute.." "..my cooter & my tooter.."  She's amazing at making professional actors break character by sheer uncomfortable funny business
“ why clean house when no one’s coming over ? “. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You can see that she had been crying.. she was trying to get through it without bawling.
She’s a comedic genius.
I’m not crying you’re crying!!
“Why clean the house if nobody is coming over!!” Lol
My drainer and my stainer, my cooter and my shooter, my dong-hole and my wrong-hole.. these skis my all time classic favorites. Puhleeze keep them going!
Hot take but it’s my opinion. Kate really phoned it in here.
Great send off
I’m not sure what rock I’ve been living under but I didn’t realize Kate left SNL because I only watch SNL through YouTube clips😅. She was my favorite cast member. I wish her great luck and I hope that the next thing that she does is even bigger
Always gets me laughing like a kid on Halloween night!
😂😂😂 I was dead when Kate McKinnon asked "Why clean house when nobody's comin' over, right?" 😂🤣🤣 As funny as that was though, her exit made me cry. 😢 She was one of my favorites on SNL. ❤️
It makes😢♥️♥️me cry to actively see her emotions during her last show there...she's amazing ❤️ I adore her!
Well...I'm crying now. She's amazing and that was one of her best characters.  SNL won't be the same.
It was her last sketch. I miss her so freaking  much
I didn’t know if was her last show- but my stomach dropped when she said she’d go, I knew that was her exit skit. Damn, she was easily one of the best cast members on SNL. Bummed as hell right now.
That grill can manspred like no other..!!
Natasha hair makes her look like she's in her 60s
Love Kate  she is hysterical
Kate  is the funniest women since Gilda
You can see in her eyes from the start that she’d been crying beforehand. Probably from the dress rehearsal. And in total Pro fashion she delivered a perfect performance anyway.
No, thank YOU Kate for staying awhile!
Congrats to Kate McKinnon for her 11 seasons on the show, she played her 22 characters and 110 impressions. So long Kate, you're walking into the next chapter of your life.
Goodbye Kate McKinnon, we will miss you and you're a true SNL cast member for 11 seasons. She is ready for the next chapter of her career. 😥😥😭😭👋
"And you; miss Rafferty?"  "Yeah same.." "Oh.. really?" "NO; OBVIOUSLY NOT."
I first discovered Kate on the Big Gay Sketch Show years ago and always knew she would be big. When she came to SNL I jumped up and cheered for her success.  One of the best sketch comics of all time.
SNL must be getting ready to pack it ALL in somewhat soon huh?
Great send-off to an iconic SNL talent. All the best Kate
Kate left the show to be molested by aliens for the rest of her life
It’s kinda said this one has a different ms. Rafferdy
The Belida Paradox: Given that any alien or Earthly civilization possessing UAPs and UAP level technology could have easily destroyed, dominated, and colonized the planet and despite having time and opportunity haven't why haven't they and what do they want?
7:39
Not sure who any of these people are...
Snl you are irrelevantAF Lauren Michaels has he has a stroke?
Not going to be able to replace her!
coot coot and prune chute
I'm never gonna be able to watch Titanic without laughing again. Never.
I'm not crying! You are crying!
It would have been better if at the end they showed the aliens getting in line to flop her knockers 😂
YYYYEEEEHHHHHEEESSSSSS  Love these videos MAINNNNNEEEE
Cecily is soooo frikin HOT 🔥
Wait....Kate Mckinnon is leaving the show??? 💔  aww man its really not gna be the same without her...man PLEASE I hope Chris Redd doesnt leave the show...Him & Kate make it suuuper funmy
Why clean the house when nobody’s coming over 😂😅
That last part got me teary-eyed. There will never be another like Kate McKinnon, she was a whole package and more.
Acting is goldmine. Show is good. Sad in real life, these people are hipocrites .
This is hilarious 😂
Why is there no sound for these videos? Do I have to pay to view them with sound?
Here's hoping that Kate and the Greys have a mutually pleasant relationship.  We'll certainly miss her on SNL.
Right  Two types rape  Thats Women position  That not, fuck off.  Arrest her
lol she be tweeking
Nice! https://youtube.com/watch?v=Rp9dC2kR4M0&feature=share
Gee, Ms. Rafferty seems really sad to be leaving Earth. 7:43
It's so glad she's leaving the show..l I've had enough of her.. And this skit with her cigarette and legs open is fast forward material....
Nonononnoononnooo! Did Kate leave SNL? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Why clean the house if no one comes over. Omg 😂
Bye Kate, thank you so much for sharing your laughter
🥹
I love Kate McKinnon😍
"Why clean the house if no one's comin over" 😆
I feel like Kate's main objection is to get Aidy to break character.   I love the dynamic between the two.
What a proper send off would've been ryan gosling on this skit again
Bums me out that both Kate and Aidy Bryant have left the show!  2 great losses to SNL.
I can't wait for Kate to host SNL down the road so we can revisit this skit again.
I remember Kathy Griffin complaining about how female comedians never got a break. It’s because she isn’t in the league of Kate McCannon, Melissa McCarthy and Kristin Wiig just to name a few.
My donghole and my wronghole! died
Whose the woman in the middle?
🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
SRB  Those were 🐍"predators ,...,in disguise
SRB  Hey 👋/... I'm think I Wass probed/ !haaa/. I bet /..
Probably one of the best exits from Saturday night live ever
What happened next? The umpire called time out and the Metz Security Staff took meout of The stadium
What a great exit for Kate Mc Kinnon- perhaps the GOAT of SNL.  I was at once touched & heartbroken 😔 💔
Love her. She’s under appreciated.
Outstanding!
Kate has always been one of my absolute favorites on SNL. I'm really sad to see her go and that send off man, just 😢 Best Wishes Kate. We Love Ya Kiddo!
snl gaining weight... and not in a good way
Hog taker and log maker.
What would have been even better Mulder and Scully interrogating them. LOL!!
fitz simmons... like in agents of shield???
Finally, I saw him laugh
This was hilarious the first couple times they did it. But the formula loses its luster after about the fifth time.
Kate McKinnon everyone, amazing
You can tell the guy is trying so hard not to laugh 😆
That small smile and tear in her eye got me all emotional. What a legend. Amazing send-off. All the best to her future! Hope us Earthers can see ya again soon!!! ✨
Funny but better with  Ryan Gosling.
Both of these gals, Kate and Aidy will be MISSED..thanks ladies for making your characters make us laugh!!
I kinda new to the Kate talent;;; but I did not think it would EVER be possible to compete with the 80s talent on SNL!!  Kate is the ONLY reason thousands of people watch SNLnow!! PAY HER a whatever it takes to keep her!! She is HANDS DOWN the most talented Comic in the last 100 years!! It will NEVER be the same without that woman!! Incredibly funny and incredibly talented!!
OMG I´m crying and laughing ... I'm gonna miss her so so so much
Why clean the house when nobody's coming over 😂😂😂😂😂😂 same 👍
Just as Dorothy says to the Scarecrow at the end of The Wizard Of Oz, “I think I’ll miss you most of all”. So too will I miss Kate McKinnon the most! I know she’ll be snapped up by Hollywood bc she is a hot commodity  Thank you Kate for 11 seasons of hilarious skits 😂
I came back months later to watch and I still cry.  This was such a perfect sendoff for an absolute legend on SNL.  But, I will sure miss Kate!
Wish I would have seen this earlier.
Incredible video!
Great video
Awesome video!
Made my day!
Love it
So good
Can you make more videos please
Liked and subscribed
;)
Enjoyed it!
Bliss!
:)
When will the next video drop?
This skit needs to be expanded into a movie
Crying in the club rn Kate McKinnon will forever be a legend
Hands down one of my fav SNL characters. 😍
No more Whiskers are Weeee =(
She nails that comedy skit.
Awwww, love her and love the character! She is amazing!
...and there she goes too !. Not sure how SNL will survive after Kate and Aidy both gone. It is true that Cecil and some wonderful new talents are  still there. But how can the void created by Kate and Aidy gone be filled ?.  I was a very late comer for SNL and very first skit I saw was the Panthene one with Kate and Sofia. I fell in love with Kate and then started following SNL. So my love for SNL started with Kate.
At7:40,it looks as if she was about to year up right there.I can't believe she's leaving but it's expected she been with the she for almost six or seven years.I'm gonna miss her on SNL.She's going to do great things.
The consummate professional! So incredibly talented. Such timing and control. I can't believe she made it through the skit without laughing and then without completely losing it in tears at the end. Kudos to all involved for the PERFECT send off. Probably the best send off of any character on any show, ever!  Kate, in my opinion, you made the show for 10 years. You were the star and the anchor of the show. You'll be greatly missed! I don't know how SNL will ever fill your spot. I trust that your future will be happy and abundant. Much  love!
LEGEND!
I didn’t realize she was leaving the show until I read the comments. She’s my favorite cast member ever 😭
thanks & rip, anne heche.  peace, ya'll!
I'm so going to miss you Kate ✌️😘 Please come back and visit SNL . May your family be safe in Ukraine and may you find Happiness, Love and Joy in your Life Journey. SNL is really losing some of the greatest comedians, but I'm sure they will gain some new talent as well. Peace be with you my Friend 🙏🏼💝🙏🏼
Wow her acting and timing was not so good this time.  Then she said she was leaving so I get it .
Little different down in 3rd class The Grey Aliens god bless em they are already standing in a line waiting to bat my knockers around lol
What will we do without Kate on SNL.  Bummer!
Damnit man, we'll never have another KM🥺😢
Man they should have gotten Ryan gosling for this one and got him to break character again lol
She kinda reminds me of Ron White..
Very, Very classy goodbye. Thank you so much Kate.
oh my gosh donghole and wrong hole! Hilarious
My favorite SNL performer ever. Good luck, Kate!
Is agent fitzsimmons a Agent of Shield reference? :P
Definitely one of the best performers period in the history of the show.  I wish her the best with her career and life.
why'd she leave? pursuing further Hollywood endeavours I'd hope... she's gotta be one of if not the very best cast member they got as well as ever had...my opinion of course
Now that SNL (So Not Laughable) has lost one of their only decent cast members, how can this terrible has been show get any worse? Have some dignity Lorne, pull the plug already. SNL is in dire need of a new producer equivalent to a defibrillator to jump start this D.O.A. dinosaur show of yours. Obviously your vision for the show needs to see an optometrist. Maybe see a podiatrist while you're at it so you don't lean so far to the unhumorous left so much either.  Get it together Lipowitz!
Aidy is SNL's agent Scully yeaaaahh
I can't wait till she comes back for a guest appearance and does this sketch again. Of course she'll have to fall out of the spaceship somehow with her prune shooter and her cooter on full display!
I don't laugh much. Just the way I roll. But, this character, and the writing, hits my funny bone 🦴 like Hiroshima.
We absolutely love you Kate.
Love you Kate.. great person
She seemed verklempt at the end. Definitely the best SNL character in years. To the extent other characters had trouble keeping a straight face for some of them, she committed so much to them.
Closest word is loke. lol.
Goodbye Kate. Thank you. You will be greatly missed.
This is wild cause we were just three gal pals road tripping to a hot sauce expo lol
I love how Shart got to be a part of this skit again .
Why clean the house if no one’s coming over?! Words of wisdom
Why are the Aliens always so mean to Kate ?
Wave pool.  Lol 🤣
"Why clean the house if no one's coming over?"😂😂😂 And did she say "Dong hole and wrong hole?"😂😂😂
WHERE'S RYAN??
I don't want this skit to end 😫
Why isn't this being made into a movie!? This would be the next Coneheads!
Fitzsimmons?!!
A comedian and artist with such natural ability to bring joy and make people laugh. One of my all time favorites on the show. She will be missed.
Just, please, I beg of you: no Colleen Rafferty movie. 90% of what made these skits so hysterical was imagining the goings-on from the lurid descriptions; try to dramatize that and it's just going to fall on its wrong-hole. :)
*Kate is SNL.* 😭 I expected to watch Kate, and her many characters, for years to come. Come bacccckk
My dong hole and my wrong hole 😂😂😂😂😂 uuiuu
🤣🤣 brilliant very funny
SNL has gone down the drain for MANY Years.
Even saying the live from New York alone has to mean something
I just can't with Kate McKinnon! If i had to do skits alongside her, I think Lorne Michaels would fire me with a quickness for constantly breaking character to crack up. Will Farrell has that same effect. 🤣😂 Kate will always be one of my all-time favorites.
Wait Kate’s Leaving?!??! NOOOOOOOO SNL WILL NEVER BE AS GOOD ANYMORE!!! WHATS THE POINT IF LIVING ANY LONGER 😭😭😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺🥺
Such a legendary character
Big SNL exodus   Kate, Pete, Kyle, Aidy
Great job!
I'm going to miss her on SNL.
A cold in and a cold out thanks Kate for all the jibber jabber GLTU.
Kate McKinnon - the absolute best! <3
We’ll miss you Kate
Not having seen Natasha Lyonne in 24 years, I noticed the eyes at almost a minute in and I had a "Holy Sh*t!" moment, especially when I heard the voice crack. This girl, I'm tellin' ya. SOMETHING about her sits really deep with me. Ever have one of "those" people you feel akin to and you just can't put your finger on it? Well, she's that one for me. I LOVE the sh*t out of this girl!!
What a legendary run
Beautiful send off to a wonderful character always loved watching her comedy
My bush was the last life boat on the titanic...
Sad to see her go, such a beautiful and talented woman.
"Like my bush was the last lifeboat on the Titanic." Wow, was that whole skit phenomenal. I can't believe nobody broke out laughing. What a flawless gem of a last performance and send off. Thank you, Kate, for your kaleidoscopic spectrum of comedic genius.
I will miss this character... Lol
Gotta love Kate
happy ending
Well done Kate! With you leaving, they can close the show or change the name into Saturday TooLateNight NotLiveShow 😂
These three were the perfect pair for her finale!!
Kate is one of the reasons I stopped watching SNL, her and Pete Davidson got popular for being shit on the show.. smh.
WTF I missed somethin whilst being UBDUCTED BY COVID! shit! Shes gone 😫
Okay. Damnit Kate. Made me emotional.
It must be nice while you two were dealing with avatars these little grey dudes were probing me with something the size of a football
Y’all seen Tony Robbins lately. Looks like Hell. Would be funniest impersonation.
I cry every time I watch this :/
Kate McKinnon was the best thing to happen to SNL since James Belushi! So sad to see her go. I can say with a decent amount of certainty that I won’t be watching much SNL that often any more
Natasha sounds like Dolly Parton. And Kate reminds me of Ron White. lol
I agree! Why clean your house ... LMAO!!!
Look I’m not proud of it but Hey why clean the house if no one is coming over right? LoL
Oh my gods I didn’t realize she was leaving until I read the comments.  This makes me so sad!!!  I love her so much; her skits will always be so funny to me!
This video is earning almost 4,000,000 worldwide views!!!!!!!!!!!!
She got so good at playing this character third time's was the charm one of my favorite skits
These alien skits are the best. I love Kate.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭goodbye ❤️
Thank goodness I shave!
I ... I ... I ... love her talent. Wat to go Kate!!!
Gawd I love this!! haha.  Shes amazing in every episode. def love watching this show.
Jesus she is not that great 🤣. You people need hobbies.
Your amazing ! Thank you for making me laugh!!
With regard to comedy Kate McKinnon walks 10 ft off of the earth! DanaCarvey  is still my fave of all time but she is definitely in the top 5!
Ahhhw Kate! You sure you dont want to change your mind? Ok, well … dont forget to write! We miss you!
Nooooo not Kate she is my favorite!! 🥺🥺
Aliens just trying to figure out why women don't operate right, why Is this model so fucked up, that's what they sayin, cause  woman will cause the man to end the world
Well, Kate I hope those aliens take you to the stars! You really should be a celebrity star!!! You’re a true Lesbian icon and legend! 🌈 Can’t wait to see what you do next!
She's a doll
Wuuuuuut????!!!!!
Oh man. She was crying. That let me know. That character was gone. Love you cate rafferty. My darling.
Kate McKinnon was a great addition to SNL for many years. Will be high up on the list with other SNL greats!
Best cam ever
If I was drunk. That would’ve been a good story
Goodeving.ledis and jentelman iam myhnemis modhu akon veri veri fani tehnkyou snl....................................................
This is Kate's funniest character by far.
@6:14 somebody plz stop her because she's getting ready to BLOW the lid off.
@4:45 Kate McKinnon just kills it, I can't believe what I'm seeing. It's so hard not to break character.
@3:40 Aidy and Mikey play the interviewers so well.
These were the funniest skits since Chris Farley.  "The umpire called time out....... Not the most embarrassing thing she's done on the jumbotron" ........  HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
This was actually funny. SNL, get with the marxist propaganda program!!!
Lol dong hole and wrong hole
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDl9ZMfj6aE
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxXF7bo5bOE
Kate McKinnon's comedic timing rivals an atomic clock.  She's an SNL *LEGEND*
Natasha Lyonne is literally a walking lesbian who just refuses to accept it, i love her
Kate McKinnon going back to the mothership is such a fitting send off for her. She's a comedy alien. Going to miss her though.
Kate 🥲 your back must hurt from carrying the show with keenan all this time
😆LMAO now that was funny!
SPECIAL AGENT FITZSIMMONS?!! AN AGENTS OF SHIELD REFERENCE??!! OMG
Why clean the house if Noone coming over! Priceless 🤣 🤣
Salute to Ms McKinnon
Kate's absence will surely be felt for a long time.
Nooooooo Kate!!!!! Come back, Please!!!!! I love you the most!!!! Nooooo!!! You Are A Geeeniuuuus!!!! Nooooo!!!!
Omg I’m dying - “Why clean the house if nobody’s coming over”… Kate, YOU ARE BELOVED. 💝
SNL has sucked for a few decades now. Totally unfunny as these so called comedians are. Also making fun of a serious subject. But i'm sure you dingbat SNL lovers think otherwise. Have another Latte.
This really made me tear up. What a great exit. One of the best. So glad I got back into watching
i cried
I just can't find Cecily funny after I found out about her abortion. She was one of my favorites and now all I can hear when she talks her saying how glad she was she killed her baby so she could "play a clown on TV".
My yeasty and my beasty 😂😂😂
All I can think is "Hey! She gets to *walk* onto the ship this time!"
I'm sorry she can't leave!!! What are we gonna do without her???? What about Dr Uknowthis? And the hundred character she played? 😢
I'm glad they at least gave her best character an ending
I'm happy for her to move on with her career but sad at the same time cuz this is my favorite comedy sets  on SNL hope she can come back and do it sometime
Damn, Lorne has a really tough job coming up to be able to bring in real talent for next season. Having to replace 4 of the shows biggest stars is not going to be easy. Let’s hope there is the next Kate, Pete and Aidy out there. This was a great send off for Kate. She’ll be missed big time on this show.
the cast sucks.  Its woke humour which is to be laughed at..not with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZP5_uVGroLY&t=108s
Yall suck for the unskippable ads.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FB-9ota5Hdc&t=353s
At least she got to keep her pants when she boarded the ship at the end.
One of my favorites of all time really Kate is a trip man her and Bobby are so underrated they know how to embrace themselves in humor just amazing
I’m just waiting for her to take a drag and go “yeah… that wasn’t it for me” 🥲😂
One of the cuter people on the planet. Will miss her, but thank heavens we have lots of her here on YT.
Aww! I didn’t know Kate was leaving, but she will be dearly missed! I wish her the best as she continues her career elsewhere, and I am in love with the way this chapter closed.
SNL is seriously dumb I'm amazed that it's still around
Not me crying…
Please someone tell me they got the fitz-simmons reference👀👀
This makes me really upset. I loved the Ms. Rafferty skits!
This is a comment.
Wish we got to see Debette Goldry
Disturbingly disgusting ... what an accomplishment to be proud of, take that world! 👏 👍😁🤣🤣🤣
Thank you for posting this. What a classy and grateful thank you to SNL. She is hilarious and extremely talented. She’d is definitely going places. All the cast leaving are are pros at their job!
Bye, Kate- one of the best!
😭😭😭 she's so good I hope she has some great new projects in the pipeline
I’m gonna miss her so bad
Kate McKinnon. Comedian. Actor. Sketch comedy artist. Improv master class performer. Writer. Director. Innovator. Legend.  She really moved the ball and chains in the comedy game forward with her unique brand of comedy and grounded humanity in each and every character she played on this show and inherent pathos and soul she always infused in them. No matter how outrageous and out there they were and get, all of her creations seemed recognizable and real. That's major league talent. She left an embarrassment of riches and instant classic body of work on this series. She will be missed, but she is ready for new dragons to slay and to continue her assent, ever forward and upward. Excelsior, KM. You are a living legend still pioneering in real time. This is exciting the possibilities of where your talent will take you.
Kate McKinnon is hands down, without a doubt, most arguably the most talented and gifted member SNL has ever had. She is an absolute legend.
Awww Kate was getting so choked up at the very end. ❤️
When she said my dong hole and wrong hole…☠️ 🤣
YESSSS they did another!!!!
Kate is right up there with Chris Farley I think. IM NOT CRYING, YOURE CRYING!
The Republicans have become the Aliens as they seek to be Green like the god they worship.
Skit’s amazing. But the very best joke is the hipster’s beard stuffed in an N95
There was once a time SNL was fun to watch. I couldn’t wait for the next episode. It’s as if the poles shifted. It’s is so moronic and not funny at all. It caters the an imbecilic TikTok crowd now the humor or lack of doesn’t make sense at all.
I no longer have a reason to watch SNL with out Kate
I still remember Kate’s first show with the Pantene commercial! I was hooked ever since!
Gold!
Is this her leaving snl?  Shes one of the best of all time.  Literally why i even watch snl skits.
this is her last episode :(
I can't watch SNL anymore because its so bad. For me, its the worst cast to date. None are really that funny. When Kristen and Bill and Fred etc left, that was when it stopped being funny. I tried many times to watch but realized I wasn't laughing at all. Some even got annoying because they would try too hard to be funny and over acted so to speak. That would be Kate. Just never got her. I can't say much because Lorne has ALWAYS been able to pick great cast members. Everyone has a bad day. Haha.  Judging by SNLs horrible ratings the past few yrs, im not the only one not watching anymore...🤭😖🤣
WTF..why i stopped watching it live ...the clapping and laughing just to laugh is annoying gets worse evey week...lets all clap so loud so the jokes are not even heard and they have to pause....i know somone whom goes to tapings just to get his clapping and yelling taped....sorry NBC prompting people to clap and laugh and scream is just annoying.
Please tell me she had a standing ovation when she got on that spaceship
I honestly mean this!  The second best ending to a comedy show, series, character that I've seen since the finale of "Newhart" (young one's look it up? It's brilliant-ty Jenny Newhart for that brilliant idea).  I only wish my dad had lived long enough to see it! He passed on April 1'st (his April fool's day joke on me lol). He absolutely loved these skits and Kate! Tears of laughter!  GL w/the aliens Colleen! Tell dad 'Hey xo' (his side of the fam. hail from Roswell, N.M. so, it's fitting!!! ;)
pubically speaking!   ROAR!   I JUST SPLIT MY COOT COOT
Oye vey my heart & curlies so sad today.  3 weeks later.  Light of day.  1st view of this skit.   At all possible to start yet another AWARD Committee.  This was 20 stars.  Unless you want a break..I call out ALL comedians with directing, producing, soul in experience to BRING THIS WOMAN FWD. 😇
Colleen Rafferty will always be my favorite SNL reoccurring character. I will miss her.
Beautiful
Omg too funny
I'm not crying, YOUR'RE CRYING.
Well, there goes the show. sigh...
3:35  "Why clean the house, when nobody's coming over"....lmao!!
This female comedians make SNL worth watching. They will be hugely missed
She is such an icon, a legend, an amazing actress and woman. We will miss you forever Kate McKinnon ❤️❤️❤️
LOL! I love this skit!
Is that youuuuuuuuuu
I don’t see myself watching SNL without the departing cast. Everyone else is filler, tbh.
Kate was the funniest person on SNL
Kate is my favorite SNL cast member. Will miss her!
This was always my favorite of her skits 😂
What about a live action "Mr. Bill" with all the CGI.
At least her send off ended with a bang
Kate is a goddess
We love you Kate!
Hey SNL you have to make some skits on the Russian state TV news channel where they talk about blowing up the world and laughing about it every night. I know it will be hard to be more crazy than that are  but it could be absolutely hilarious and if anyone can do it you guys can!
😘🥲💨
this has got to be the best cold open I've ever seen! why clean the house if nobody's coming over, was legend
So now can we have a regular weekly series based on this story-line? I'm sure it would be well-received, and that wonderfully funny woman can finally have a regular paying gig! Sad to find Ms. McKinnin is moving on to a next chapter, but very excited to see where in the universe she is headed to now! Love and a big thank you to you, Kate!
Bittersweet this was the first one I watched don't know how I missed these so I watched them backwards she killed it sad to see her go
Definitely going to miss her she was awesome and extremely funny
♥️👽🫶🏼🛸
best recurring sketch in 20 years!
It is a TRAVESTY that Kate is leaving. I honestly think she's the funniest person that's ever been on the show. Well maybe tied with Maya and Kristen.
"I'm sorry... Womderwear?" "Yeah, because if you saw them, you'd wonder where they've been" (LOL)!!!
Ms. Rafferty (LOL)! HILARIOUS!!!
Aidy, Kate, and Cecily. Outstanding!
SNL Legend right there. She will be missed thats for sure.
"my donghole and my wronghole" is probably the best one of those they made for this character across all these sketches.
She's better off with the gray turds.  We Humans are the worst and planet Earth is a "chithole!"
Kate carried this SNL cast.
I work with lady who is exactly like Kate's character..... 🤣🤣🤣 kills me
she’s a legend
Honestly for me that's the true statement I think I've ever heard besides saying it myself. I do feel like an alien on this planet. I am not like the Norm.. for me it sucks but I'm sure somebody's getting a kick out of it somewhere. And if not someone well then something, like the universe! Here's hoping that you host sooner than later. Because you will be missed from this weekly show.
Wow she really started breaking down at the end she obviously loved being on SNL
She is so funny hope she gets a great funny character bc she seems like she gives her all lol
SNL sucks
They haven't done a euphoria sketch yet.
So good!
Sounds like ayahuasca
A perfect ending, for a perfect artist ❤️May the force be with you ✊🏾WHOSE KEEPING THE IGUANA THO? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🥹🥹
will the new writers be able to save SNL? The cast is nothing special obviously and never memorizes lines.............can they save it
why do my favorites always have to go?
Nooooooooo..... This skit is one of the funniest things I ever seen!
I'm waited weeks to watch because I'm not ready to let go of Aidy and Kate 😢
...that fortune  teller was dead on😂😂....
LMAO😂😂
Seriously.......best ever SNL skit.  EVER
This is one of the better skits I always enjoy it's so raunchy but hilarious. Let me guess....  Hillary is not running in 2924? lol
I would totally watch it if they made this into its own little show 😂 like her adventures with the aliens
Going to miss Kate McKinnon very much! It breaks my heart that she's leaving. Wish she would change her mind and stay longer!
Congratulations 🎉
Awwwe, she made me 🥹. ❤️❤️ you Kate! Thanks for entertaining us ❤️❤️
I remember when bill hader laugh so hard during kates audition. A true funny comedian. Snl is lost without kate and aidy
I almost died at “dong hole and wrong hole”
Kate leaving really hits me. pure talent and a beautiful soul. this was such a good ending to the close encounter saga and an incredible goodbye for her. i'm gonna miss her so much
Kate McKinnon made me laugh like Gilda Radner did. Gafaws and Giggles! Keep pushing that comedic line, Kate. America needs an enema when it comes to knowing how to laugh at ourselves.
Miss wonder wear is the funniest 🤣
Wow I’m crying, I’m going to miss her too much
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
Take care, so long and thanks for all the fish?
Sorry, Loren Michael. You are now Steven Seagal 👎
The SNL would be like this... The Dodgers without Kershaw and J. Turner.
They should have made this the last one of the show. It would have been her last, making it like Kate didn't leave, she went to live with the aliens
Kate is a legend. Thank you.
This is old?
😂
WHAT?
Kate was the women who got me interested in comedy! The funniest person out there. A legend forever kate
And so, Kate McKinnon joins the ranks of many great performers who came before her:  Leaving a popular, lucrative gig and walking off into the shadows of obscurity.  Goodbye Kate, say high to Bobby Moynahan and Jessica Bayer for us - whatever they're doing now.  :P
Tearing up as she leaves this crappy planet.  😢
“Why clean the house when nobody is coming over right “ 😂😂😂that’s it for me…
You will be missed Kate! God Speed on your new adventures..
The part of er character I don't understand is the need to spread, where does that come from?
I will miss this skit series so very much.
Kate McKinnon = never funny
These women are a gift to humanity. I love you all! Will miss Kate and Aidy <3
I’m really going to miss Kate McKinnon.
I still can't believe Kate & Aidy are leaving😭
she barely kept it together at the end. I will miss her! One of the best cast in allof SNL
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
5:33 matt foley maneuver
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
The way I almost cried at the end. Great send off for Kate!
SNL will be unwatchable now.  She was the only thing holding it together barely.
I hate that she's leaving... she's the best thing to happen to SNL in a very long time. Love that woman!
I could not stop laughing at the part she played so well, with such a straight face as she became the Character as no one else could ever do....miss you kate
I cried, first laughing, and then.. so sad..
Why clean the house if nobody’s coming over!!!!!!💀💀💀
The news that is so sad SNL can't joke about it.
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
This is the best sketch template in the last decade hands down
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
I’m old enough to remember real comedy.  This isn’t it.
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.

Crying crying crynig

That was one of the best send offs. She will be missed. I hope to see her on the big screen. She is so talented.
😂😂😂😂😂👍💕💕💕
I love this! What a powerful person and I love all your characters to the max!
<3 love u kate
I feel like the line “I always felt like an alien on this planet anyway” is a reference to the challenges of being a zany, queer comic genius misunderstood by society until you get your big break (becoming the funniest SNL cast member in lord knows how long). Thank you, Kate McKinnon, for gracing us with your unearthly talent.
The most stable relationship I've ever had.... I'm dying
Wish it wasn't he last one these have my rolling and crying
Whyyyyyyyyy???  I laughed and I cried!!
Perfect send off for Kate 🥹 so many hysterical lines but with the perfect a motion am send off!🙌🏻 we’ll miss you Kate!❤️👽🛸
Wow. This just wasn’t that funny. And Mrs. Rafferty is one of my favorite characters. Wish Kate all the best, clearly it’s time to move on
Fair well Kate, I hope you well on your next adventures!
A class act! Kate McKinnon has made me laugh like no other on the SNL stage. God speed. I wish her so much success. A legend!
I've never had an SNL sketch make me cry before (at least intentionally) I will miss you on here Kate :)
So, is she still ending up with the grey's?
I had no idea she was leaving SNL.  You are one of the best Kate and I know you keep those Greys happy!
The absolute best send off EVER!
Kate's send-off.  😞
Please Kate. Check in. You and A are my Saturday life.
On a scale of 1 to 10 a 35! Unbelievable  talent.
Wish they had done one more Girlfriend Talkshow
Kate was fighting back the tears at the end, bless her.
Not me crying at 4AM on a Monday because I chose the wrong time to be down the SNL YouTube rabbit hole… Kate forever 💔❤️‍🩹❤️‍🔥
Not even a tiny bit funny.
Damn if Kate and Baby Adie aren't breaking my heart. Really gonna miss those angels
Awww that's sweet.  Thanks for being the bright spot for years, Kate!  ♥
One of my favorite skitz    Wish I was one of those Aliens
This was the second worst cold opening ever. The only one as bad was right after Trump won the election. Ok, I have to take that back. It started off so bad I didn't watch it to the end. Now I see it was a sendoff for Kate. Sorry.
SNL truly doesn’t understand when a joke has run it’s course.
Will miss you Kate. Thanks for all the laughs, you are an exceptional comedian!! X
Love you guys
Wait....SHE'S LEAVING!?!
Dear Kate McKinnon, thanks.
Kate was the only superstar in this time period. No one else comes close.
Damn, that fortune teller was dead on! 🤣
OMG from laughter to crying 💔💔💔 SNL without you Kate💔💔💔
Nasty.  I shouldn't love this  but the depraved part won't   shut it off.
Nice laugh track for the least funny show om the air
It’s sad seeing Kate leave but what if Natasha Lyonne takes her place????
Good performer. Now on to a couple of movies that bomb at the box office and a sitcom which doesn’t get renewed for a second season.
I have never been so entertained by cootie hair jokes.
Love u kate
Gonna miss her
Kate was the reason for a lot of us to have loved to watch SNL religiously.  It won’t be the same without her and Leslie Jones.
Got the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. reference: Fitz-Simmons 😊😊😊
Pete Davidson should of went out with Chad.
This is how I found out Kate's leaving SNL </3
Legend
Nooooooo.... She's gone? 🥺
Some actors know when they should move on. It's not when their act becomes stale but when they are still beloved and at the top of their game. Thank you both Aidy and Kate for so many great memories watching your characters! I am sure you will be just as great wherever you go next!
I still say that I would love to go out on a date with Cecily in this character.
Only Kate McKinnon can pull this off. Simply the best skit of modern SNL
Kate McKinnon has made me laugh to tears so many times, but this time real genuine tears shed when I saw that last scene.
I 💜 Kate! She is so Talented😿😻
is this funny?
I have not seen a live episode in probably 15-20 years except the Eddie Murphy host one.  I did not miss anything.  The show sucks.
Didn’t think I’d tear up 🥲 but I did when I heard her voice crack…. Gonna miss her on SNL
McKinnon > Ferrell
Natasha Lyonne is the best host this year. Great acting and timing.
I'm always amazed when I hear that some people still watch SNL
I hope SNL will replace the outgoing casts with POC and mirror reality of US population.
The best part of SNL: Kate has left the room. You’ll be deeply missed Kate McKinnon. Best wishes for a new adventure but please keep us laughing.
kates final "live from new york" makes me sob she will be missed but im so excited for what shes gonna do next!!
Great send off to one of the best cast members of all-time! We’ll miss you Kate but are excited to see what you get up to next!
Kate McKinnon will be greatly missed on SNL. BUT... this stupid sketch about aliens being interested in her crotch will not.  The writing on SNL had gone into the toilet, quite literally.  Merely using a lot of trashy words isn't funny all by itself.  And acting silly is not the same thing as being funny.
perfectly done
but how will we live without kate? i don't remember life before her.
She made me say my koot koot and poop shoot. Seriously You are The Goat Kate !
A genuine SNL classic
The ending was so sad 🥺
This is the first time I've seen an official send off. Usually they just get abducted without any witness.
now do your worst Kate...chew up Hollywood
Such a great sendoff
We need so many more of these lol. So glad to get at least one more though 😆
Great scene.  As a fan of old-timey lingo, I wish that Kate had said: "Yeah, a little different down in steerage.".
This skit is getting burned out
She’s one of the best ever.
Kate is the only good thing on SNL. Now I have zero reasons to watch.
😢😢😢😢😢
I like this skit with Ryan Gosling MUCH MUCH more.
Dear…. Thank you for everything
Thank you love for everything
"I always kinda felt like an alien on this planet anyway." A poignant statement after Florida's don't say gay law.
still waiting on her life to be a movie lol
Hey Kate,   I was reading the lyrics to Patti Smith's wistful "Distant Fingers" and it reminded me of this character.        Love ya!
This was a positively brilliant sendoff for a legend.
So many probes
UAP giggle ignorance
Beware the bearers of false gifts and their broken promises. Much pain but still time.. There is good out there. We oppose deception. Conduit closing.
SPECIAL AGENT FITZSIMMONS, OMGG. MY OTP
NO WAY IM GONNA CRY
Practically and Sensibly truly curious about your motives?..
Take me with you!!
OMG i'm dying lol
Kate! COME BACK!! How are we EVER going to make it WITHOUT *YOU??*
TTFN Colleen and Kate and the rest of her wonderful characters.
Hi there. This iceskating show does not exists in reality. Some criminals did this show to harras me . Some of them kidnapped me as a child and did digital copy of my young body without my permission. They  are making big money for selling online this show and meanwhile they are intimidating and harrasing me because they do not want anyone to know that the show is faken and almost all consist from digital copy of my childish body just with different digital girls heads. I do not know the names of the criminals who did this. But I have a suspition that they are Ahmetov from Moscow Snegeri, Medvetev and Motisin, Ahmatutov from Perm, Morosov from norikel, Mitini from Keansburg, and Dowbing ave Sea Clif. It is tbey probably were who used to steal me for making digital copy of my body for porno and other kind of stars for making digital tv shows. The criminals should be in jail till the end of life. They sometimes kidnap people making new radioheads band to serve them. Probably they from Perm Haiva area, they have kids who they ask to translate their cfiminal mind like Turpina, Tikhomirovi, Zenkovi and others who works for them. They are very bad people. Someone of them did many skeches from my family members for skeching faces of presidents and uk kingdom members. They skeched Clinted body as Paul and face for prime minister of UK. Some of these them always hacking me and selling my voice for banks, mobile company robots and other bad stealers company. They need to be stopped from making this criminal job..  ..., ,,,
Made me cry, damn it.
These Kate McKinnon/Alien skits are the best.
I'll miss you Kate😥
Excellent!!!
Oh God I am going to miss this.
You will be all missed. Wish you all success, and hope we will see more comedic work in sooner. Your work and the whole cast gave me laughter, distraction, and pure entertainment in times of sadness and uncertainty. Thank you Kate, thank you all.
She deserves to be remembered among the very best of SNL cast members!! She was versatile and extremely funny! I can't wait to see her next projects.
I’m really gonna miss Kate’s energy on SNL but I just hope that she is making others laugh in whatever projects he does next, good luck Kate and much love you have a bright future ahead of you. 😊
Kate McKinnon is a poor man's Molly Shannon and Kristen wigg
Good riddance....not even funny
SNL - please never stop creating comedy! I LOVE YOU!!!!!! :D
Kate was my ultimate favorite. I’ll miss her so much
All the best, Kate, and thank you for the laughs!!!!
Why clean the house if noone is coming over... 🤣
🥺😢😭😭😭😭
IMO the first encounter was the funniest one and mainly because Ryan Gosling kept laughing. The other encounters weren't funny at all.
OMG -  I know that character!  She lives on my street!
They haven't been funny for quite awhile.....sad
Kate - thank you for all of the laughs 💚💚💚
After all said and done she'll definitely be considered among the greats like Will Ferrell, Chris Farley, Bill Murray, Bill Hader, Kristen Wiig, etc. She'll be in the top 20 AT LEAST.
Wow, no one in comments mentions that the agent is called Fitz Simmons, which is a reference to the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Tv show
Kate is just a fucking legend! I love Aidy too.
This was actually a good long running bit.
*SNL:* "Hey people really liked that skit, let do it exactly the same a few more times."
i was watching this on the night it was crazy i was enjoying this as i do and boom she's going with the alien's i was not thinikng this was it  i am said she's leving snl needs kate mckinnon!!
Glad she left tired of her upstaging us. Its was all about her all the time. Being s lez is not a privilege its a choice. Someday truth will be told.
So glad they picked a Mrs Rafferty sketch as a send off! 1 of my favorites.
Absolutely brilliant! Can’t stop laughing 🤣🤣🤣 Can’t wait to see what she does next 💛
Kate is leaving?! Wtf 😭😭😭
Kate has left? No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no nnnnooooooooooo 🥺😢😭💔  Kate McKinnon you will always be my favourite. Thank you so much for the innumerable laughs, especially as the legendary Ms Coleen Rafferty, a character literally no-on else could have made as hilarious as you have. May your future be as bright as a star, you amazingly talented lady 😘❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You know, Kate was the main reason I started watching SNL.
Sad to see her go
Oh I’m going to miss you Kate 😭
:*(
Goodbye to one of the only reasons I watch the show i’m going to stop watching it now
the camel toe. God bless her.
😂💖👍
Thank you, Kate for being so amazing and making us laugh!!! I"m sure bigger things ahead with all of your talent - God bless!!
I'm going to miss her.
Kate looks like Hayley Mills' evil twin here. 🤣
This was cool and all, but she did this big grand exit at the end........then was in another sketch in the Women's Commercial.  I feel like this should have been the only thing Kate was in that night.
Why am I crying. 😢 ❤️
Absolutely heartbroken to see Kate go. She is one of my all time favorite cast members. I hope to see her in many more projects. 😢❤🎉
😭😭 I cried! It’s been real Kate
I love how Kate has worn the same outfit in every one of these skits.
kate McKinnon!!! take care on that spaceship outta snl ! Dont eat the yellow snow!! fantastic performer 👏👏👏👏
She is EPIC!
Literally went from laughter to tears 😂😔
The faces!!! 😂 4:35
And what happened after you fell (naked from a space ship)?  “The umpire called a time out.”
Am I the only one crying
Sorry...so boring. Not funny...sad. Long overdue...change. Shut it down...over.
#SNL 😁🥰😁
Even better watching it over again
I'm going to miss seeing you every week, Kate and Aidy. Great farewell to Kate.
Wait that’s the actress from But I’m a Cheerleader!
She is awesome human being
Good luck Kate you’re amazing.
That was so hilarious
Kate McKinnon one of The Greatest!!!!
What’s SNL without Kate? It will never be the same. I know she will have great success in future endeavors, but it’s sad to see a legend go.
Best cold opening in a couple of decades.
This skit has gotten old really fast .  Same thing with the cake maker skit .  Snl blows dong
I love Kate and will miss her crazy behind!  Aidy, I’ve got love for you too sis!
Had no idea she was leaving. What a loss!!!
SNL is never going to be the same without Kate McKinnon
Oh Kate I wish you the best and more 🥹
Skit idea here: Jason Momoa videocall from Johnny depp trial. Priceless
Such a great way to end it Kate McKinnon is a legend 🤍
I'm going to miss her.
One of the best SNL has ever had
One of the best sketches. Kate we will miss you so much, hopefully one day you'll host
Love you, Kate McKinnon!!
Did she say Donghole and wronghole?!?!  😆😆😆
I love Kate. I'll miss her and the show won't be the same without her.
I will miss her
Kate is the Best of the Best.  Gonna miss her.  But she'll be doing some amazing other things, I am sure. 🥰😝
What a great season finale episode. You could tell that Kate was holding back the tears before she said "live from new york...". It reminds me of my last day in high school. I was reading something out loud to my classmates. then the last four years of my life literally flashed before my eyes. I had to stop reading, chuckled a bit, then I excused myself. I didn't cry but I was feeling a certain way. Kate is definitely one of the greats. She will always stand out in my mind as being just as good as her predecessors. Natasha did like one of the best performances as a guest host. Kinda stole the show. KKW did ok for not being an actress but Natsha killed it. She needs to be in the 5th-time-as-a-guest-host-club.
Oh my God Kate, we are going to miss you. Your ability to make us laugh and cry in the same minute is absolutely unique. You make us feel alive. Thank you for being who you are!
❤️
💓💖
Why clean the house if no one’s coming over 🤪😂🤣
I never cared for her political hit pieces but she was one of the best and most fluid characters.
Whatever Pigs
Sorry but Kate McKinnon is terrible in this lol. I remember this character but this is really badly acted
In 1975 I watched the 1st episode of SNL, & have watched SNL ever since. In my opinion, Dan Aykroyd was the most versatile cast member until Kate McKinnon’s incredible versatility surpassed even Aykroyd. Never in the history of SNL has anyone equalled Kate’s ability for foreign accents, & no one has come close to her ability to portray people of the opposite sex, plus her comedic timing & rhythm during skits are unmatched. Just look at this skit as an example. There’s never been another cast member who can tell such a long story & it sound so totally natural. I will miss her more than any other SNL cast member who has left. I wish her all the success & happiness she seeks. Kate, you are 1 of the most vivid colors in the rainbow.
🤣🤣🤣🤣👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
What a legend!
She's such a wonderful, versatile talent. It's kind of hard to imagine the show without her on it.
So when's Keenan leaving?
She saved the best for last!
Who going to do Dr. FAUCI... 🤔🤔🤔
😂😂😂
Funniest skits ever --in tears over here.
Kudos to Natasha Lyonne for not breaking!
Kate into the Stratosphere... This is perfect.  I'm blessed as so many fans to see comedy at her level of commitment. So many great characters and b impersonations. Seems fearless ❤
Well, I just went from laughing my ass off to crying REAL quick.
Terrible writing.  The writers don't seem to put much effort or have the talent.  All the actors are good though.
I heard Fitzsimmons and could only think of Fitz and Simmons from Agents of SHIELD  I am going to miss Kate and Aidy so so much!
"My dong-hole and my wrong-hole." 😂 I had to watch this again to hear that.
Damn, that is so funny!!
"why clean the house if no one's coming over"  milk through the nose.
Loved these skits especially with Ryan Gosling
I' was in tears when she said goodbye.  We'll never forget you or your taste hole and waste hole, Kate.  You're gonna play the hits forever!
WOW, NOW THAT'S HOW YOU EXIT...STAGE NORTH.
Imagine if prince Harry married this American 😂😂😂👌
Goddamn, how do I get teary eyed watching an SNL sketch? I dunno, but I did. Thanks for the laffs, Miss Rafferty.
Did anyone else see Kate channeling Stanley’s mom from MadTv when the grays were elbowing each other and saying woahh! 4:27
She the besttttt love her
Elvis and Kate...didn't die, just went home. 👍😎
She filled Kristen Wiig's shoes brilliantly as the "wacky lady" of the crew and now I really can't see a good replacement this time. She's just huge.
She's an SNL Great. Sad to see her go.
She is one of the very best, what a way to say goodbye~ Thank you for a million laughs!
Ah I hate to see Kate go!!! The paranormal skits, for a time I would watch over and over! The laughs got me through some difficult times. She is a real 💎 Gem!  This was very bitter sweet to watch. “ No reason to clean the house if no one is coming over”😂.  Thank You for making Ms Rafferty so Dam 😆 funny!
American humour...? Pfff....
Goodbye Kate ❤️
this is so played out....
My yeasty and Beasty 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Aw crap, Kate is leaving SNL? God, I love her skits. So many memorable characters. I'm sure I will see her in other things, but damn! SNL will have big shoes to fill. Good Luck Kate! Your awesome!
I didn't realize she was leaving until watching this. That sucks. She's one of the best ones.
Nooooo….. dont go Kate!
Best actor! She is going to be missed
I will miss her!   She was the absolute best!
Once again, SNL proves that they don’t mind shooting themselves in the foot, or in their case both feet.
Why clean the house if nobody's coming over lol
Did I just watch this? Yes. Did I cry at the end? Yes.
They should have ended it with one of those little gray aliens whacking her right in the knocker
Kate you are amazing... will miss you on the show dearly
Well done Kate-best of everything to you!!!
She became verklempt.
Aww man I teared up too. Dammit Kate, we love you
It'll never not be sad when a cast member leaves. I look forward to seeing what Kate does in the future, including whenever she gets to come back and host.
I love these 😍❤️🤣
After a bit of cursory research, I finally understand all the awkwardness in this episode. We’re sadly losing Aidy, Kate, Kyle, and to a much lesser extent, Pete from the cast. While I adore these cast members and can honestly say they are what brought me back to the show in the first place, I think they are all incredibly talented people with bright futures ahead. I can’t imagine a show without them, but I guess we will find out next season what that looks like. 💛💛💛
It's always a bummer when a great cast member calls it quits, but nobody can stay with the show forever.
Kate and the beginning of weekend update are the only reasons I watch anymore. Very few can bring me to tears laughing.
Your soul, forever for my state. The sole "As you dead People" found again. Please check last three hours. Dead people want a God, Roy! Your fraudulent court morgue (1589) Hero - Enrique Iglesias - YouTube "Your Soul copied for Possession Science
She absolutely destroyed these skits! How anyone managed to not just fall over laughing is beyond me!
Love the “Agents of Shield” reference
Kate will inevitably end up hosting SNL at some point and they are definitely doing one of these sketches when she does. This is not the last time we have seen this.
Kate is just too much in this skit 😂
Kate and Kenan were absolute legends. The show will be nearly unwatchable for me without them. 😭
So sad come 2 a end still funny snl make a movie of this and weekend up date need 2 bring funny back 2 theatre ✌✌✌✌
Kate's gone Aidie's gone Pete's gone please Keenan don't leave, you can do 25 more years.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
No body hits it harder then Kate ... Gonna be sooooo missed no one can fill her place .... Much love Kate 💖 and I'm stoked Natasha is the  host actress she worked with on here last!!!
Wow. I’m sobbing while on lunch break. What a send off!
How anyone can remain straight face while Kate is in the room is beyond me. LMAO!!!!!! She is definitely one of the GOATS and will truly be missed!
Kate is a friggin genius!! I do not know how they did not break character lol
this's supposed to be old show no smoking but rock n roll pal
WILL MISS ALL THE PPL SHE IMPERSONATES, MALE & FEMALE... THAT ARE ALL CLASSICS... SHE DID THIS SKIT FEW YRS, AGO...IT WAS HILARIOUS, ALSO...SHE DID ALOT OF BREAKING CHARACTER, EVERYONE IN SKIT, WAS CRACKING UP, AND SHE JUST LET LOOSE... OMGOSH... LOL...
I was keeping it together but "The umpire called time out" absolutely killed me
Sad to see her go! But, it’s cool knowing she will be back sometimes! I’m sure she has all kinds of opportunities lined up! This was as good as the LEGENDS from SNL!!
OMG i cried
I know we won't see her every week but there is no way she doesn't come back to host multiple times and do this skit.
❤️. Thank you Kate McKinnon for being an amazing entertainer (actor) and making me laugh so hard my stomach hurts…but most importantly thank you for being your genuine & authentic self! I’ll definitely miss seeing you on SNL but can’t wait to see what you’ll do next…
I love you Kate! You are a comedic genius!
Why clean the house if no one is coming over This is my favorite skit
Thank you KATE !!
How did Natasha keep a straight face?!?! Omg... I'm going to miss Kate!!!!!! 😭😭🥰❤️
uh, so beautiful.
Why cleaning the house, when nobody's coming over...! LOL I'm stealing this! Kate, you are a legend!
How did they not laugh
Why clean the house if nobody’s coming over - story of my life!
So nobody is gonna comment the Agent Fiztsimmons thing? cammon, where are my Aos fans?
Who would have thought that I’d be laughing in hysterics one minute and bawling the next. What a perfect sendoff for Kate. I will miss her most of all… There’s no other on this show or off that is as genuinely funny as her. So long Miss Rafferty, enjoy your new life buzzing around the outer spaces! ❤️
SHE IS THE GREATEST SNL’er OF ALL TIME
WONDERFUL!
Why does she have to GOoOoOo :((((
I teared up at the end. Kate has become a snl legend, but she'll be back im sure.
Still can't believe she's leaving. We will miss u Kate! Maybe back as guest sometimes? Love you so much😿😿😿
Talk about beating a Dead Horse.
Long since subscribed to SNL, pretty much because of Kate McKinnon. She’s been absolutely fantastic and I will hugely miss her sketches now…👋🙏🥰
I'm so happy she did one more of these before her exit! Thank you god!! However it would've been funnier If Ryan Gosling was in this final one too but oh well.
I'm so going to miss Ms. Rafferty... and her cooter and prune shooter...
Great skit... but why would the NSA investigate this? Seems like a CIA/FBI thing don't it?
One of the best to ever grace the stage and the greatest comedians of all time. SNL won't be the same without her. We'll miss you Kate! On to bigger and better things! ❤
Not knowing this was her last episode blows
Wow. End of an era guys.
Kate!!!!! You bish! How dare you leave us! All the good ones jumped ship together now wtf are we supposed to do?
Awww what a hilarious send-off! It will be odd not having Kate on the show. She is an absolute comedy legend and I can't wait to see what she does next.
This one was the worst imo. Should've brought back Ryan Gosling or Casey Affleck.
I love how comfortable Kate is with doing quirky, uncomfortable humor. She's going places, and I've been thinking that for a while
It sure why this made me tear up a bit. Kate will be missed.
0:45
I almost didn't have time to pull my "wonder where" back up.   Your wonder where?  Yea, I call em that cause if you seen them you'd wonder where they been.  I fell out......
😅😂
Kate McKinnon is literally the only reason I watched SNL for so long. She’s one of the best cast members to ever grace that stage!!! I’m gonna miss her SO much!!!!
FITZSIMMONS!!!!!!
I remember when SNL used to be funny.
I’ll miss her. And I’ll still watch these sketches.
Held back all the tears and not the laughs
I’m so sad she will be gone, I lived for any sketch she was in. Absolute legend, can’t wait to see what she does next.
Now this character of Kate's.... there's a movie that'll have you crying tears of laughter....I LOVE her in this character, ALWAYS makes me laugh...and these days, that's something we all need more of....
I love the names she comes up with for her body parts but sadly other then the names wasn’t all that funny should have brought back Ryan gosling that would be great again.
Show is not even funny anymore
Only wish Ryan Gosling was here for this send off skit lol
stop it! stop crying! the ending got me
noooo my absolute fav sketch series and legend on the show
No not Kate 🥺
Hard hitting moment. Greatly significant amd captured, thus immortalized. Just as a legendary icons' send off should be. Earned her exaltation, hands down.  She was critical to the current SNL era.  Thank you to Kate McKinnon. Positive Energy your way and good luck on all your future endeavors.
Kate is one of the very best to come out of SNL. I'll miss seeing her regularly, but I wish her the best on her future projects!
Man… glad to see I am not the only one who cried. Ugh! This character always had me laughing. I cannot imagine SNL without her. She was fabtastic.
Man… glad to see I am not the only one who cried. Ugh! This character always had me laughing. I cannot imagine SNL without her. She was fabtastic.
🤣🤣 hilarious asf
Boiii thay camel toe went through them jeans
Kate McKinnon was like Will Ferrell, she could do anythiing.
My dong hole and my wrong hole LMAO
I’m gonna miss her on the show so much! I hope she hosts in the future omg 😭
Ah, dearest Kate: we will miss you more than you’ll ever know.
Kate😭 We’ll miss you!
THIS IS HOW I FIND OUT.
Kate we love you....best of luck on all future endeavors. You will always be the best🥰🥰❤❤
One of my favorite ongoing skits. It hit me harder than expected this time.
Don’t know much about her, but can sympathize about heart wrenching era endings. Hope she does well in her future endeavors.
The funniest thing I’ve ever seen on SNL. Love you, Kate!
Why clean up the house if no one is coming over! ☠️☠️☠️ I’m dead, hahahahahahaah
No no no no NOOOOO
had to send off all the white cast members to be replaced with black gay or asian or preferred all 3
I actually teard up
This is has always been one of the best of SNL....Kate is hilarious,  plays this part so well....will be missed ....
When you reflect over the years, she's been a key component of this show for so very long.  Consistently strong and clever.  She'll leave a massive hole in the cast, God bless her
Whichever galaxy Kate finally lands in, she'll be the funniest thing there, too.
jesus, she has me laughing and then tearing up with her goodbye.  She is one of the greats
"why does this feel like a send-off?"  *scrolls down* No, no no no god no please
This is the most emotional abduction I've ever witnessed.
Since it was aidy last show too she should have been like "screw it I'm coming too" at the end and went with them lol.
Kate McKinnon is comedy gold!
Its been a while but hey they aliens  came back lol
A legendary send off for a legendary cast member 💜
Kate never cared about us. Her sole mission was to make her cast members break character and laugh.  😅 We were just blessed enough to be invited for the ride. Well done Kate, well done 💜
Oh that was emotional she is so freaking talented and great sendoff i am sure we can expect great roles from her in the future I remember kristen wiig send off and these 2 iconic ladies are the reason i was watching snl
if you don’t bring her back to host i swear to god i’ll probably cry
i’m gonna miss this woman so much. forever and snl great to me
Please watch this. Make sure to control your own emotions first. (1578) Along with the Gods: The Two Worlds - YouTube
Kate is AMAZING and I cannot stop laughing- she is pure genius……
Brainiac
I would just love to be miss Rafferty's pair of Levi's lol
These were some of the best skits I’ve ever watched on SNL. I hope when she comes back to host they do another.
Honestly  they should’ve just did a farewell season finale without a host ….
I'm more of a 80s & 90s SNL girl (Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, David Spade, Dana Carvey, Mike Meyers, etc), But Kate was one of my faves from the current cast. I'm not sure if I'm going to watch anymore, to be honest.
Too bad they couldn't have gotten Gosling back for the final installment
Beautiful send off❤️🫶🏼
Still crazy awesome !
Kate introduced me to SNL (in the Uk) and I'm internally grateful to her for that
This was polling the worst skit snl has ever done. Not funny, crude and classless.
-Earth will never be the same- SNL will never be the same
Cool runnings Kate!  ur a legend ❤️
💛💛💛💛💟💟💟💟💟
I was waiting for her to start touching the other cast members 🤣🤣🤣
Bro she be getting the worst 😂
Rap artist here  so sub if ya want
I am actually a rap artist
This is my favorite... Finally..  #chirpedoutchirp
She could stop a room in its tracks with that smile then make them run for doors with her deadpan humor. She elevated with her art.
"...my dong hole and my wrong hole..." 🤣🤣🤣
Damn, truly the best.
I loved every small part of these segments, but no doubt Kate made them what they were. As she made SNL what it was. What a series of sketches and what a way for both her and her character to say goodbye. You will be missed.
Kate was def my favorite on SNL, her characters will surely be missed ❤️❤️ what a legend
Seeing Kate choke up and have tears made me choke up and have tears!!! Her and Aidy both will be missed…the show must go on as they say but I don’t know if it will be the same without them… 😥 Good luck on your next adventures Kate and Aidy❤
The agent trying her best not to laugh
SNL is good generally, but they MUST STOP SHOWING SMOKING. It IS NOT NECESSARY. It is DESPICABLE. They have NO EXCUSE. WHEN will they get it right? I can't recommend to anyone a show or skit that shows smoking. Smoking is no part of life, only of filth, disease, and death. Where avoidable, NO ONE should be shown or described smoking in any medium (video, still image, or text; big screen, small screen, poster, magazine, or audio). NO ONE real or fictional, good or bad, lovable or despicable, funny or not, interesting or boring, sane or insane. NOBODY. EVER.
Kate the legend, leaving like a legend…
Kate is truly out of this world. Each and every character she embodied, she committed to 1000 percent! Such a joy to watch. "Wenewdis"  day would come and wish her all the best!! Thank you for all the laughs.
I'm pregnant, and I definitely cried at the end 😭😭😭 She's one of the greatest of all times to ever bless us with her talent on that SNL stage!
“Why clean the house if nobody’s comin’ over?”  🤣🤣🤣🤣
oh nooo i didn't know she was leaving until watching this D:
Kate you were the best thing about SNL made me laugh so much every week love you so much and good luck in your future <3 hope to see you on the screen again v soon xxx
Dong hole and wrong hole!🤣🤣
still crying, we love you Kate!!! come back 😢❤
Awwww!!
Kate is GOAT
I’m tearing 🥹
Should had Ryan Gosling in there.
Kate is who got me back into SNL. I'm really sad to see her go. :(
🐐
Dmt trip
One of the greatest cast members of all time. Gonna miss you so much Kate McKinnon.
gonna miss Kate for sure!!!
The Great . . .Kate.
Oh I didn't know Kate McKinnon was leaving snl. I'm sure she'll do great
Kate, Kenan, Aidy, Pete... These are big anchors for SNL...
Lol
https://youtu.be/V9gS8S0GhLA
Aww lol  ok
3:20
why clean the house if no one is comming over 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🤣🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Wait.. Was that an Agents of SHIELD reference with the Fitz-Simmons name?
Went out in style! That's was perfect. MAY THE GODS SHINE YOUR PATH💫🤍🕯
Oh man . Appreciate so far as they are here.. because they won't be always
This actually made me teary.... 🥺 We'll miss u Kate ❤️
I just wish I could say to Pete Davidson: you made me laugh when I wanted to cry...helped me want to live when I thought I should die your cousin *from Boston
I'm gonna miss her.
What a classy way to go out.  “Dong hole and rong hole”
Did anyone catch the Agents of Shield reference?
Well this show is gonna suck without Aidy and Kate.
The last thing I said at the end of this, “Godspeed, Commander. Godspeed.” That’s all I can say. 🫡
One of the greatest SNL has ever seen
Kate is a legend.
Like a Hipster's Beard stuffed into an N95......😂😅😂😅😂😅😂
Her "dong hole and her wrong hole" 😂😂👏🏻👏🏻
Wait…Who’s leaving?? This was hilarious 😂
She will be missed. She's awesome.
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
We're gonna miss you Kate!
Aside from Strong, she was the only one left that was good. Something tells me that already dreadfully bad sketches will now get even worse.
Pure gold.
"Why clean the house if no one's coming over right?"
Aidy looked like she was about to bust character and crack up thru the whole skit :D
I almost cried at the end omg
Hysterical...
Kate is pure gold
Aidy trying not to burst out laugh during the entire thing is priceless because I know how hard that must have been for her.
Natasha Lyonne has got that Joan Collins look down.
I didn't know this was her last skit. The ending was so amazing and emotional.
Kate is, in my opinion one of the most prolific cast members SNL has EVER had. She has given me dozens of hours of laughter and I will miss her presence on the show. Good luck to you Kate and I hope we see you on your future endeavors and I won't miss the episode when you host your first SNL episode. Nanu-nanu!
You might think she was kidding, but that shit happened ! ✨🪐✨        ✨         🛸      🌎                         ✨ Honest !
Awesome skit.Touching ending. Please invite her back often.  Also, please consider doing a skit on SCOTUS, but call it SCROTUS, highlighting how 4 men can decide the fate of more than a hundred million women. Maybe have a guest appearance from Ginny Thomas. Probably too much, but maybe have Samuel Alito talk about reversing Loving v. Virginia.
Love her!! 💙💙✨️😊
So bummed she is leaving. Get her to stay noooooo she is the best they have ever had!
I actually cried laughing, and I cried more at the end.... I'm going to miss Kate!!! I 💙 you, and thank you for everything you've done for the show!!🎊🎊
Sad to see her go. The only part of recent SNL.
Love this.  Great send off!   Too bad Ryan Gosling couldn't make it back.
My yeastie and my beastie are in full view 😂😂 why clean the house if nobody's coming over right?
Love this skit and the war in words, truly would love more
Ha ha ha Shes a nut
Morris and the fitzgerald
Wonder which ones the hoe
💘💘💘
This shit is FUNNY!!!  Love all of these Encounter skits. Kate did a GREAT job !  ;0
Absolutely adore Kate. She’s truly in a league of her own. Endless brilliant can’t be taught talent! Thank you for letting the world meet you ✌️💙♾🤩😭
Legendary sendoff to a legendary cast member! She will surely be missed, and hopefully only great things will come her way. Thank you Kate, for all your skits on SNL over the years <33
Prune-shute 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ "wonderwhere" I love Natasha's hair here. Reminds me of my 1st grade teacher.   Why clean the house if nobody's coming over....words to live by
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 love you Kate!!!! Thank you so much for all the laughs you've given me!
Okay, but Natasha Lyonne trying to keep it together with Kate McKinnon between her legs...
Kate was an amazing part of the show. I am so sad to see her go and can’t wait to see what she will do in the future. Thank you for the laughs!
One of the best casts!! Ever
Kate will be missed...so awesome
She's a genius
And this is how I find out she is leaving 💔
The funniest skit ever.
Wait Kate is finally gone? Thank you god!!! Pete leaving is just a bonus. I don’t recognize the other names.
Guaranteed they will bring her back to host the show. She’s way too popular.
Kate is a genius!
Man , Oh man  !
OMG!!! “My Bush is like the last lifeboat on the Titanic” LMAO
Repent to Jesus Christ  “Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.” ‭‭Colossians‬ ‭4:6‬ NIV
She had to say live from New York like that to keep from crying... 😢 Damn... I love Kate McKinnon... I got choked up too didn't respond when I was spoken too for a good 20 seconds lol... "You're a Hunter, Jake! You don't want the truth to land at your feet you want to CHASE it!" -Kellyanne McKinnon ♥️

This is the best send off they could’ve done. The comedic history of this skit, and Kate’s irreplaceable addition to the show. Going to miss the laughs, she always knew how to bring them!!
She’s the reason I started watching SNL! 🥹❤️ Good luck on your future endeavors Kate!!!!
Glad Mikey Day is staying on SNL.
Colleen Rafferty is great but there is NO topping the skit with Ryan Gosling! I will miss Kate tremendously! I really wanted to say goodbye with either Sheila Sauvage or the Italian old man but this was happy too. I'm seriously so sad to be losing 4 such talented people at once. I honestly couldn't watch it on Saturday. I've been saving it for a couple of days so it wouldn't be over.
It is such a pleasure to watch her. Miss her already 😢
So far this is the best comedy routine of 2022. My absolute favorite.
End of an Era
😂😂😂😂
been a long time 👍
Why do the like aliens look like Lorne a lil bit 🤣
“ Its a jungle down there “
SNL needs new casting people and better writers. I love SNL but the last two to three seasons have been hard to watch. Kind of cringe at times with a few funny moments. They need to more asshole comedians who actually have chemistry.
lol why is all of her stories about her hoo ha being out
Kate , you are an amazing comedienne. Thank you for  your brilliance and humor. You will be missed.
I only wish  could have seen Kate Mckinnon and SNL alum Cheri Oteri in at least one hilarious skit together. Thanks Kate for being so GREAT!
I will be honest, when she first showed up on the cast I didn’t care much for her.  However, once she got her feet under her man ole man was she off like a rocket.  Not only did she make me laugh, but she quickly became my favorite cast member.  She is going to very sadly missed, hopefully she is on to much bigger and brighter things in her future.  She has become a super star legend like many before her.  I am excited to see just how far her star can rise, she is awesome and I only see great things happening for her.  Thanks Kate for all the laughs over the years on SNL, you are a beast!
I'm not crying, you're crying.
Hipster beard in an n95 😭😭 nice goodbye, all the best in your next chapter! Thanks for the laughs. 💜
I'm gonna miss her so much on SNL. I haven't gotten to see her live yet & I didn't get to see her on SNL in person
Why clean the house. Beat vag joke ever. Hands down
7:35 If I was in the audience when Kate said 'I love you.', I would have yelled out 'We love you too!'.. and probably would have been escorted out of the building.
FitzSimmons
You comments people are joking she's not actually done right
Coot coot prune shute🤣🤣🤣
Snl is barely funny tho.
i’m going to miss her so much
Noooo!
Oh. I didn’t realize. Well F I’m bummed. 😢
👀 at that I love this skit
Kate and Pete are both legends in my book. SNL never held my interest as much as it did with Pete and Kate there so losing them both really really sucks. I'll miss them but I wish them nothing but the absolute best in everything they do from here on out.
https://youtu.be/p14mc2TUPGI
Kate and Amy are my two favorite snl cast members, and they're both leaving. 😔 I can't handle this.
I hadn't laughed so hard in a long time.  Gonna miss her!
Didn't see myself tearing up at the end of a sketch like that, but here we are.
Worst most unfunny show on tv
no more  last few A+
There was a time when women had a hard time finding footing on SNL. Meanwhile this woman came in and basically carried the show all the years she was a performer. They should put a bronze statue of you inside 30 Rock, Kate.
Shows disgusting
So good!
My yeastie and my beastie are in full view!  WE WILL MISS YOU KATE IT WON'T BE THE SAME WITHOUT MS RAFFERTY AND HER MOM JEANS 😝  👋  Hopefully you'll be back as a host - soon!  😘
kate and aidy made snl SO FUNNY
Hands down the best series skit she’s done. I don’t think anyone that’s ever participated in this sketch along with her ever lasted without at least slightly breaking. I’m gonna miss her - she was one of the greats, easily among the SNL alum elite.
The pure emotion at the end... you can truly tell she put her heart and soul into SNL and that's why she will be one of the greatest to ever be apart of it. Thank you so much.
This was a great way to go out and I'm so glad we got one last sketch of this series-its one of my favorites.
Kate is one of my favorites. She’s helped get me through some tough times. I thank her for all the laughs. She’s one of the funniest people on the planet in my eyes.
Intelligence and charm,the gal in green is be..utiful also!
Good thing they come up with new ideas this sucked
Dong-hole? - or - Wrong-hole?
Good lord, the comments in here..... and these people vote.  Its no wonder our country is in the toilet.
She’s my favorite from the SNL crew and will definitely be missed. Got a little chocked up as she said goodbye 😢
She got tearful. I love her.
What's the last thing that middle person did Who is, UM… AH… Lucky? Enough? To host your shitty SNL Show fucking losers you can't even nail a skit you've done white like 15 fucking times!? This show is a joke it's a sham it's stupid no one likes it you've ruined it just get rid of yourselves quit stop while you're below and behind because you will never get ahead your shitty fucking political Outview just shows how stupid and ignorant you people are and you're all gonna burn in hell and it's funny how bad you are. Speaking of how bad you are this is the caliber of gas you guys get now? You fucking losers who is this bitch isn't she only in like white American pie from like the 90s that's her last fucking movie retards everyone else just says no way I'm not going on your shitty show you work fuckheads! It feels so good to watch you guys fail after all the shit you've put people through go get boosted losers how do you get another vaccine shot you fucking retard ruin your immunity so you can get sick and die fucking losers   😂
heart felt tribute. but it felt so rushed. each successive line just felt like they knew they had to get the skit done quickly because it was the cold open, and that it was nearly 8 minutes long. everybody got their lines off really fast, and it took away from the 'in the moment' vibe for me. this send off for the great Kate Mckinnon would have felt better if they slowed it down just a bit
Amazing send off for Kate. She’ll be sorely missed 🥹
As long as Kenan Thompson is still a cast member I can handle this. Kate, Pete, and Amy are great though, sorry to see them go :(
Great send-off 1 of my favorite actors ever on snl she will be missed
Godspeed, Kate!!!
Laughing, laughing harder… tearing up, crying… wonderful send off to a true SNL Icon 😂🤣🥲😩👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Okay now Kate has made me cry TWICE watching SNL!!! 😳😭😭😭😭
Love you,  Kate!! MUAH 😆 😆
So long Kate!! We love you!
Is Kate officially leaving?!?
Looking forward to when she hosts in a few years and does part 5
She's the best!! I don't wanna watch it without her
Hipster's beard ...
Easily one of the best reoccurring skits, Kate is amazing
My dong hole and my wrong hole.  lol
🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😭😭come back!
Dong hole and wrong hole 😂
that was a pretty cool goodbye
I didn't realize this was her last show. She  is a National Treasure. Simply among the greats
Please give Kate a late night talk show. She'd be perfect
all of these are pure gold
"Why clean the house if nobody's coming over".......OMFG...I am so using this.  Kate will so be missed.  She has such range and gave us greats such as Jeff Sessions, Rudy Guilliani, Ms. Rafferty, Justin Bieber, Hillary Clinton, Olya Povlatsky, Ellen Degenres, Angela Merkel, geez, I could go on and on.  I loved every skit she was in.  She elevated it even if she did not steal the show, which she often did. I will be excited to see what she does next.  I hope it's something big, she has so much talent.
In tears. Thankful I may watch Kate when I like on YouTube. Love you, Kate.
Im not crying… you are!!
Has to be the funniest SNL since the original cast.
Gonna miss you, Kate! You've made us laugh so hard over the years. Can't wait to see you in future roles!
“My donghole and my wronghole” 🤣🤣🤣
Wishing her dong hole and her wrong hole all the best for many years to come! ⛳🕳💛
Her Ellen, RBG, Manipulative Momare gold
Omg 😂😂😂😂😂😂
“I say what the hell, play the hits.” 😂
Amazing skit! One for the ages.
Kate McKinnon is seriously *totally* awesome, all of the cast are awesome. Always joyful to watch SNL. (Also, was that a Fitz and Simmons reference?)
Love you Kate. ❤️❤️❤️
Baby jesus take all the kardashians and johnny and amber 🐂💩 drama, and let us keep her thank you baby jesus
♥️
Noooo!! She’s leaving?! 😭  Hope she’s back to host soon. Best of luck, Kate! One of the greats!!
This is honestly the best thing I've ever seen
Great opening segment. Good luck, Kate!
n95 lmfao
I’m getting verklempt, talk amongst yourselves, here’s a topic, crows feet, they’re neither crows nor feet.  Seriously though, crying real tears. Kate is easily in my top five all time favorite SNL cast members. Legendary.
she was one of the best. love you Kate!!
Kate got me into SNL. I'll miss her very much.
Dude im drownin in my tears rn i didnt know that this was the last act of kate in this show and im so upset right now 🥲😭 she is the goatttttt in history of this show 🐐
I love you Kate
She will be missed!
COMPLETELY AWFUL
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
Damn I’m gonna miss seeing her every Saturday.
You are a true GOAT in this comedy game!  Live on like the legend you are!!!
i cant decide if i want to laugh or cry
ooof, crushing.  I didn't know she was leaving.
WWHHATTT!!!!! YYYYYYYY KATE YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
*Thank you Aidy and Kate, for all the laughs and memories!* 👏🏽
Yeah Katie we love and already miss you  Brava brava maestro
Kate is the MVP of SNL!!!
This was the second saddest (in a good way) send-off of an SNL cast member, after Kristin Wiig. Bon chance, Kate.
she will be missed.
I love her abduction skits, hilarious 💯 🤣
The first time I saw Kate McKinnon on snl she was playing Ann Romney on weekend update and absolutely killed it. I knew from then on she was going to be someone special
Welp that hit me hard. Kate was my favorite! oh, man. I am sad and I think a mosquito poke both of my eyes. Love ya! The real GOAT!
Kate is a legend…the only real talent. Aidy  what’s her name..eh.  Davidson…an absolute train wreck of a human. Not funny or interesting.  Just frightening.
Y'all didn't give Kyle a sendoff, I'll never forgive u
she is the best
I have watched SNL since the very first episode and Kate is, imo, one of the top five cast members.  She will be sorely missed!
Gonna miss her. She was the best.
Thanks Kate
Was that supposed to make me cry?
I'm not sure i can go on without Kate, Pete and Aidy 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭. Whhhhhyyyyy???? 😭😭😭😭😭😭
My favorite cast member, Kate M, is leaving. I always looked forward to her. I can’t imagine anyone better.❤️
Should of brought Gosling back
No please don’t go…. This was one of my favorite skits besides gilly
Kate holding back tears as she said goodbye was too much :(  She will be dearly missed.
Been watching SNL for decades. Kate is THE best I've ever seen. I will never forget her cold opening from November 2016. Love you Kate!
Kate, you're the best. We will miss you!
Her swan song skit...I nearly cried when she teared up. I love her!
Sorry, but as good as it should be, it's just not as good as Ryan Gosling trying to keep a straight face while Kate is describing her experience! 😆    edit: nothing at all against Kate because as usual she did wonderful and she WILL be missed!
Everything woke turns to shit ...
Bye Kate
That send off was one of the best, right up there with Phil Hartman and Kristin Wiig.
You could tell she was losing it at the end.
Genuine tears at the end. She lived the dream.
Kate gonna go down in snl history as one of the greats. So many classic skits. Can't wait to see what's next for this legend
You're simply the best!!
Don’t go Kate 😭😭😭
Thank you Kate for 10 amazing seasons. You are one of the best cast members to ever appear on the show.
The GOAT!! Absolutely love her!
Amazing send off. I put Kate up there with the comedic greats such as Lucille Ball and Carol Burnette. Will very much miss her each week.
Jesus is coming soon!  Please repent of your sin and turn to him.  Jesus died on the cross, was buried, and rose again  third day, in fulfillment of the scriptures.  He loves you and wishes that none should perish.  He died so that we may have life, eternal life in heaven.  Read Romans 10:9-13 for starters.  Believe in your heart who Jesus is and what he did for you.  Are you paying attention to what is happening in the world??  We are at the end, Jesus is coming.
Kate McKinnon is the reason I started watching SNL again after SO many years. I've grown to love and look forward to seeing her and the rest of the cast. All good things must come to an end I suppose. Best of luck in all future endeavors Kate, Aidy, Pete and that other guy!
Ty for all the laughs you three, I’m gonna misss u guys so much
Why clean the house when no one is coming over...lol.....classic line.
Nooooo Kate plz don't leave
Gonna miss her on snl. Great sendoff for a talented actress/ comedian. Hope she comes back and host someday.
Oh how I love Kate!! So sad that was her farewell😢
i went from hysterically laughing to crying so fast. i can’t imagine the show without kate
Kate McKinnon was funny sometimes
Goodbye Miss Wrong Holio 😞 ❤ 💋
💜
My god she's funny, always. I've watched SNL since the beginning, and there have been many great comedic sketches & actors. Kate has now set the bar pretty high. "... I got more hair pokin' out the sides than a hipster's beard stuffed into an N95" 😆
i wanna cry bruh im gonna miss kate so much
7:09 "I always kinda felt like an alien in this planet anyway." ❤️
Damn when she broke towards the end, I kind of cracked too.  Great sendoff to a SNL legend.
"My pubes were the must-have of the season" 😂🤣😭
Wow she will be so missed. The funniest lady ever on SNL. And I've been watching every cast since my teen years in 1976
Nanu Nanu!!
Hot sauce convention… “No obviously not…” Wonder where…🤦🏻‍♂️ My yeasty and my beasty. “Why clean the house if nobody’s coming over.”🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ The fortune teller… “That really rips my nips.”🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️  Now that’s a proper sendoff!  Thanks Algorithm!
"I Always kind of felt like an alien on this planet anyway" —same Kate
Some day, I hope the Aliens return her.  Until her return, 👽🖖
i can still natasha’a ny accent
I was cracking with loufghter and silent creams, great send off indeed
I don't want her to go she really is an amazing comedian and will be missed 😢 😭
I think I had that shirt Kate is wearing….in the 80’s
Hallelujah and godspeed to one of the best.
Wow, didn't expect tears watching an SNL skit. 🥺
I didn't know Kate was leaving snl to they lost Pete and her
Well I didn't expect a lump in my throat. I'm going to miss Kate. She's up there with the very best, Murphy, Ackroyd, Chase, Rudolph.
Cheeky Marvel reference right at the beginning 😂
It's actually emotional to see her go... may those fat-headed Gray Aliens, with their big, dumb eyes always treat her Choco and Taco with the utmost respect!
The two of them met the Andromedeans and she was kidnapped by the Dracos greys
awww kate made me tear up at the end.
Where is the LOVE BUTTON!!! Thumbs up isn't enough!!
All of the SNL cast are awesome this season but Kate is my fav! For a funny skit I sure cried at the end! You will be missed and I will watch all of your movies!
"I'm not crying, you're crying!" "Please stop crying, I'm crying too."
Haha it ain't an encounter till Ms. Rafferty loses her slacks
aw she got teary-eyed.  please don't go girrrrrrl
I am so crushed that Kate is leaving SNL! This is my all time favorite skit and female cast member of all time. It isn't going to be the same without her.
Damn. That fortune teller was dead on.
When she started walking up that ramp and turned around… not gonna lie tears were in my eyes.
Thanks Kate and Addy.
SNL will NOT be the Same without Kate!!!! xoxoxooxo
Truly a treasure of this show. She will be missed. ❤️
Ooohh, gonna miss her sooo much.  Real legend!
I can't believe Kate, Pete, Aidy and Kyle are all leaving SNL. Such great talent. They will be missed.
These are the funniest ongoing skits and have been waiting for a new one for a long time. This one felt like a bit of a stretch. You can only call your body parts so many different names. Sad to see her go she is funny. Best line ever “there I was Donald ducking it”.
Kate, you brought us so much love and laughter during a period of great sadness and turmoil. You are an angel, returning to your kind. ♥ We better see you in tons of movies now!!!!  ♥♥♥
"I've always kind of felt like an alien on this planet, anyway." #TRUTH
Couldn’t be better!  Good luck Kate.  Thanks for all the hah ha’s
Kate too?? OMG so many GREAT and TALENTED ppl are living SNL after this season... I'm sad now.
This skit is modern day GOAT status, van down by the river, more cowbell etc
I needed Ryan Gosling
The sketch should have ended with Aidy running up to Kate and saying "Wait, I'm coming with you!" Then they both shout out "Live from New York, it's Sautrday Night" and embrace as the ufo door closes. But overall, an excellent send off.
Man, she had trouble delivering the "live, from New York, it's Saturday night" line.  She almost lost it.  And so did I.
shes been the best part of this show since she joined the cast
Wow can't believe she's leaving she has been so awesome and funny. One of the best and I'm so glad it was this sketch as the 1st one I ever saw had me rolling all over in fits of laughter.
not the same without ryan gosling
Kate and Aidy both going away is just not right. They had great chemistry together.
My favorite Kate McKinnon moment was when she made Ryan Gosling break character. 🤣 I can't wait to see her future work. ❤️
I hate hate hate when the genius SNL actors leave.  Kate is one of the best of all time. ❤️U Kate 🥳😘🙏
the line about a hipsters beard in an N95 hoooly shit
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
Gonna miss you :)
This was a proper sendoff for the most talented cast member since Eddie Murphy.
This was so ridiculously funny!
Now I’m crying watching SNL!! Never thought I’d say that! 🤣Kate is one of the best! That’s for sure!!🙌
Dong hole wrong hole
Why clean the house if no one’s coming over right😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Kate never failed failed to make me laugh,comedy is in her bones. Looking forward to seeing what she does next.
That's one hell of a send-off and couldn't be more deserved.
kept having to rewind the closing of the show over and over just wanting to see kate and aidy for the last time.but we can all rest assure the kate and aidy sometime down the road will host SNL .I think it would be insulting if kate and aidy never got to host SNL. last time i did cry  for something like this was when kristen wiig was leaving the show..
probably the funniest female ever to work  in SNL.... i wish they brought the women from MAD TV back.
Damn she will be missed!  Amazing talent!
Kate McKinnon is a legend, she got the send off she deserved.
Now I’m crying! Kate was one of the best on SNL, she always gave everything in each show. I’ll be using the bearded hipster joke for sure! 😆
gonna miss this sketch,but i have a feeling whenever and i know she will sometime down  the road be hosting SNL.,this sketch will done again
Good riddance.
was sad to see.it was.
She didn’t let me down!!
Damn. The ending of that skit hit me right between the eyes.
Already missing you Kate.. you re great. Trully
Kate McKinnon
Absolutely perfect, what a pro.
"...my dong hole and wrong hole..." had me in stitches 😂😂😂
Wow - funny and emotional at the same time.  Quite the sendoff.
She’s been my all time favorite woman on the SNL stage!!! This made me tear up! ❤️
Love her simile and dimples
We love you Kate!! A true comedy legend ❤️
💕💕💕💕love you Kate💕💕💕💕
Aw that was bittersweet, those aliens looked exactly how I thought they would lol
I think she rly was an alien, sent here to make our awful lives a little better
Wait, without Kate, who will play old men? Who?!
I waited so long for another "encouner"
I didn’t even know it was Kate’s last episode but I could tell how she entered the alien ship and took that deep breath. Dang, she was one of my favorites!
I really like Aidy Bryant. She's going to be a star for a long time.
I feel guilty that I'm so sad to see Kate McKinnon, Aidy Bryant, and Kyle Mooney leave, but with Pete Davidson I'm like 🤷🏼 eh.
This group was probably the best in a long time. Kate McKinnon is a star. She'll do well.
She is my favorite. The. End.
We’ll miss you Kate.
Kate is so very talented and versatile. Her performances as Hillary, including the one with the real Hillary, were SO good. And the debates with Alec Baldwin as Trump were epic.
it’s an amazing sendoff!  i hope she has so much success in the future.  she deserves it.
She's one of the bestest
I can’t wait for Kate to come back and host. It’s going to be off the chain.
Natasha Lyonne struggles a bit here.  Didn't see the rest of the show, hope she did better, love Russian Doll.
The “hipster’s beard shoved into an N95.”
😭😭😭😭  No! no! no!
"My dong hole and my wrong hole." 😂🤣😂
What a perfect execution by everybody and perfect acting. How did anyone keep a straight face.
Never heard of her. The scene was kinda gross.
Hope Kate's final cold open was a wakeup call to Lorne and the writers that one of the only funny cast members is leaving.
I'm genuinely upset Kate is leaving. She was the funniest cast member. Always makes everyone in the scene with her burst laughing. But Pete Davidson is getting all the acknowledgement for leaving even tho he was never there!
You gotta pay for fake commenter’s fake comments because it’s so bad. Now that’s funny🤣
From my Beastie to your Yeastie, thanks for all the laughs, Kate!  You're the best! ❤️
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
Kate's been the biggest reason I watch SNL. Gonna miss her a lot.
Every rural Trump voter ever
I don't normally like female comedians, but she is an exception.  So is McCarthy and Cecily.  Great humor.
kate, you are a legend.  looking forward to your future projects! 💕
holy shit how did i miss natash lyonne on SNL. I'm watching Russian Doll
Agent: "Were you unsettled by this at all?" Kate/Ms. Rafferty: "Nah, honestly the entire time I was thinking, 'Damn that fortune teller was dead on!'"  😂
No wonder she had a sad tone and her voice was breaking at the end of the skit… it won’t be the same without her 😔 great sendoff to an absolute legend.
When I realized this was her send off I cried. She's an SNL legend and no one can ever take her place. Gonna miss you Kate, good luck with everything!
Is it really just three of these abduction sketches?  What a missed opportunity, but they're SNL gold for sure.  Kate has carried the show for years. Tough shoes to fill.
Kate was one of the best.
I'm not a praying man, but... Dear Lord,  PLEASE let this massively talented performer go on to have the post SNL career she SO richly deserves. Amen.
I've never laughed at a single thing she's done and after watching this that still holds true.
“I figure, may as well play the hits” - the writers going into Kate’s last episode
I didn't know this was her last show.  I sure hope it means we'll be seeing her in more projects.  She is my Goddess.
"Pubicly speaking"   "I got more hair poking out the sides than a hipster's beard stuffed into an N95"  "Why clean the house when nobody's coming over, right?"  "Damn, that fortune teller was dead on!"     Kate is my Goddess.
Just hope she doesn't go þe way of Jane Curtain.
I cried when I read the comments. Kate can't leave us!!! She's the best lesbian of all-time. Who will our community look up to now?!
That was such a good send off and the strongest writing of the three
This is agent fitz Simmons of agents of shield.
Wait...whaaattt?! Kate is going off snl?! 🥺🥺🥺🥺
Iconic send off! Donghole, wronghole and all!
Dong hole and wrong hole😆
😂🤣😭🥲🤪😘🥰‼️
SNL is NOT supposed to make me cry, damnit!
So. Damn. Funny.  I love her.
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
She was the best part of SNL. Gonna miss her
Bye to the glorious 🐫 toe.  😢
The ending got me teary eyed. I'm absolutely gonna miss Katey.
The end of an era is coming. This is the first big piece removed.
GD I will miss Kate, she is the best thing to happen to/on SNL since Gilda Radner, Lorraine Newman & Jane Curtain. Gonna miss her so much, that was the best send off skit ever. Best of luck to all her future endeavors!!
Thanks Kate for all the smiles.
“My dong hole and my wrong hole”  IM SCREAMING 🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀
:( love u kate
It's going to be a different show without Kate. She was one of the anchors
Kate almost lost character with this one. It would be tough to get through those lines.
Gonna miss Kate lighting up Saturday nights. Fitting skit she has out of this world talent.
Our Final Encounter! What a perfect send-off. We love you, Kate! ❤😭
Kate is a LEGEND and my ALL TIME favorite cast member.  First time I have shed sad tears over one of her skits. Look forward to watching her on her journey.
Should've waited for Ryan gosling's next appearance
Kate leaving signifies the end of an era
Well, Kate, we love you. Thanks for staying awhile. You brought laughter into the darkest days of our history. You spoke out on important issues and did it with grace and humor. We look forward to the brilliance and laughter you will continue to light the world with, but we will miss you on SNL. We will miss you horribly. 😢
Very sad
Listen if you are going to give Kristen Wig the send off they gave her , I dont understand how Kate did not get hers in comparison ( i do get Kristen's send off was super rare) . All i am saying Kate was just as brilliant , its sad to see her go . Pete ? C YA i mean it was hip hop that wasn't that great to be honest or just a narration of his life . But Kate, Addy I am going to miss . Kyle well i guess he was always misunderstood
She started to cry when she said goodbye.  I will miss Kate M. sooooooo much !!!!   God bless you sweet woman !!!  You make me laugh so dam hard !!!!
Kate McKinnon has been my favorite actor/actress to ever be a part of the SNL crew... Best wishes to you, Kate, as you start your next journey. Thank you for all the laughs you have given me, during the roughest patches of my life. 😎💗🎉
All the best on your future endeavors Kate🌈❤️
She's definitely the best part of this show. Can she please do a movie with Will??
Great send off for Kate! 👽👽👽
Kate is the best part of SNL. I'm so sad she's leaving.
I cried as much as when ET went home l! Kinda love that her voice broke during the Live from NY... I know we aren't saying goodbye to Kate, or even the character...obviously, Kate's going to be a major movie star! But her Hillary playing Hallelujah got me thru that very bad time, she was one of the best celebs in the category of "helping the people hold it together" during a very tumultuous time. The whole cast is great, but Kate is a unique talent. let's be gentle to next year's new class tho...we always complain about the current snl and then lionize their predecessors lol...
Such a good send off!! Kate McKinnon is iconic!! Losing a legend! 😭
Why clean the house if no one's coming over? Just like my wife...😂🤣😂🤣Good luck babe.
A SNL LEGEND!
Kate is a comic genius
Losing a ton of talent this year. Aidy, Kate and Cecily are gems... Where does this skit rate in the all times list for SNL ? Its got to be in the top 15
Omg!!!!!! Freaking hilarious 😂
I love her so much
She's trying not to cry at the end
Hey! Did you know God is three in one!? The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit! Bless them! Jesus died for our sins, rose from the dead, and gives salvation to everyone who believes in him and follows his commandants!  Have a blessed day, everyone!!! ❤
Once you've seen it once, you can tell Aidy is trying not to cry at the beginning.
I'm gonna miss her so much!  I wonder who the new cast members will be. I would love to see TikTok comedian Kris Collins (Kallmekris) on there. OMG she is HILARIOUS. I would especially love to see Riley or Misha or Sergei in a skit 😆   The only downside being that obviously her usual format of playing all the parts wouldn't work through that medium. Still, it would be great!
Perfect sendoff.
Wow.. Didnt know it was her last..I wasnt a fan of hers and didnt think much of her stuff as funny.Yet its always moving when a cast member finally leaves to either get big or do another Ghostbusters remake😁..
Goodbye Kate, we'll miss you!!!
i can hear her voice trembling :( youre amazin kate
sadly, she was the only thing that was making that show.
I think Pete got a little choked up.
Wonderful ..she was great one of a kind
Didn't realize she was leaving. I've always dreaded this day, Kate is a legend and one of my favorites ever. Can't wait to see what she's got for us next
McKinnon and Aidy are top tier cast members. I hadn't heard the news they were leaving, so this episode was emotional.
I'm gonna miss Kate McKinnon so much. Everything she does she kills and it really isn't gonna be the same without her.
not funny but gross
One of my favorite bits every time, I'm dyin 😂
Goddamn.  One of my favorite KM sketches!! Kate is this generations Phil Hartman, Gilda Radner and Wll Ferrell rolled into one.. She will be sorely missed. Best of luck and Thanks for all the funny Kate!!💗💗
I'm verklempt. Kate is legend, and this was a valid send-off. Hope her character comes back to visit when they have Kate on to host.
kinda miss Gosling trying not to laugh and hiding in his hat.
I just read that most of the cast in leaving. Kate, Aidy, Pete, & Kyle are leaving, too. 😢😢😢😢😢We need as much comedic relief as we can get these days. So very sad to see them go. All will be sorely missed.
Kate will be sorely missed for sure!  I really don't know how she kept it together when she did the Africa board of tourism skit and Adele kept breaking character...I watch that skit over and over and never get tired of it!
I feel like Kate received a standing ovation which made her tear up.
That ending made me cry 😿
NO WAY!!!!!!!!!!   I hadn't heard she was leaving!!!!  She was my favorite!!!! Brought tears to my eyes.
I will miss Kate on SNL she made my boring Saturday nights hilarious.
Didn’t laugh once. Great job. 👏👏👏
This is the skit that made me realize just how ridiculously hilarious and talented Kate McKinnon is. She’ll be missed 🥺
Damn. I'm in tears. Very unexpected. Love you Kate! Alien speed.
Love Kate McKinnon!! That was too funny!!🤣😂😂
I’m going to miss Kate so much. She’s been incredible on SNL. She’ll be missed.
5:39 LMFAO
Jesus Christ is the ONLY way to Heaven!.. Believe Jesus is the Son of God. Read the Bible. Doomsday is on the horizon. To believe in Jesus, because: 1) He is the only One who emptied himself, to be a servant of all. 2) He is the only One who came to the earth and took an initiative to make a relationship with people. 3) He is the only One who died, rose again, and ascended to heaven. 4) He is the only One who dedicated all his life to live for God. 5) He is the only One who sent us to be the witness, to tell the world about His story. 6) He is the only One who claimed God as the Father. 7) He is the only One who has brought the messages about unchanging faith, hope, and love!.
All teary eyed at that ending, am I right? No? Just me? Well then..
Aidy was already crying after the applause I’m done.
These are my favorite SNL sketches. Absolutely hilarious. Too bad this is the final. Always a treat. And I'm truly gonna miss Kate. She's now an SNL legend.

It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
Don’t go I’m miss you 🥲
Omg "my dong hole, and my wrong hole" hahaha some of Kate's lines are the sickest, and funniest ever
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
my favorite cold open EVER and I have watched since very first episode.  Natasha, a shout out for not busting out laughing with Kate all up in it there LOL
i teared up in the end. She's got such a gift and I'm so glad she got the opportunity to share it. Thanks for all the laughs and I cannot wait to see what's next for her
"Why clean the house if no ones coming over....?"
Gonna miss Kate!! So damn hilarious!! GOOD LUCK.
Farewell, Kate!  You are a marvelously funny person, and I can't wait to see where your work takes you from here!
“My dong hole and my wrong hole”.   I completely lost it on that one.   Kate McKinnon is the best!
Don't know what I'll do without my weekly hit of Kate McKinnon (during SNL season).  Reruns will have to do somehow.
One of the greatest cast members of all time.
She is a legend....
This was my favorite character Ms Rafferty was not dealing with the top echelons of alien abductors
kate McKinnon: spread your legs  funny  give award pls
Noooo! Kate is a legend!  I had no idea she was leaving show. That was a good skit for a sign off. Really really gonna miss her. 😢
I can't even breathe right now. Sobbing. But I know that Kate McKinnon needs to move on and step into her Legendary greatness. #IconStatus
Hopefully next season she can be the special guest of every episode!
Farewell Kate McKinnon, Aidy Bryant, Kyle Mooney & Pete Davidson! You will all be missed!
Aidy's so trying not to laugh.
Crying 😭😭😭😭
Shes one of the best all time SNL cast. I remember when will Farrell left it was sad. When the great ones leave I always would  say how can SNL go on without that superstar but they always do. Good luck kat.
She's in the top 10 best SNL cast members of all time. Debate your mama.
Ugh.  Natasha Lyonne.  Hate her.  Totally not funny.  Just annoying.  Of all the talented, funny people in the world they could have picked to host SNL... how the fuck did they end up with her?  And, Jesus, this skit is SO over-done.  Again, with all the supposedly talented writers and performers in the room--and all the crazy shit going on in the world--the fucking UFO thing was the best they could come up withi?  No wonder Kate is moving on.
literally no one watches this stupid show.
One of the best to EVER do it. You'll be missed, Kate.
That ending is a tear jerker. Her last big breath almost broke me, she’ll definitely be missed. Good luck on your alien adventures after snl. 🥹
Lol an Agents of Shield Reference, I love it!
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
Kate rules
Saw a news headline about her leaving, so I popped over. This whole liberal garbage scow of a show needs to end. It stopped being funny in the 90s. Now, it's just skit after skit of progressive talking point trash.
By Kate.... you are so great, cant wait to see you act, write, and direct on some more stuff like you!
AWWWW IMMA MISS HER💔
Not much reason to watch SNL with McKinnon leaving.  They'll get a new crew together and hit a rhythm again, but she's been the major source of show stopping moments for a long time.
NOOOOOO!!! take bruce willis!!
Best cast member and best skit ever!!!! Gona miss her for sure!
Absolutely Hilarious
One of the best people the show ever had. Great last skit
I really miss Leslie and now this will be just as hard. My two favorites leaving.
Thank you for all the laughs
I almost didn't recognize Natasha Lyonne
damn... i'm truly crying. Kate McKinnon's and Kristen Wiig's goodbye are the saddest to watch for me ;'(((
Kate is an incredible actress. These sketches aren’t even my style of humor and I’m always watching them just to see her perform
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
First time they did this bit, I was laughing harder than any other SNL bit I have ever seen. and was not the only time Kate McKinnon single handed had me cracking up. Thank you so much for the laughs
I'm sad dude. She was an Amazing Comedian I've ever seen. Great Sendoff 💜️😥
She’s a top 10 all time cast member. That’s out of hundreds since 1975. That ending hit me hard out of nowhere. She didn’t break character til the VERY end….touching as hell.
Land ass up in the middle of a field, a baseball field! 😆🤣🤣
That was so funny and I sobbed at the end.  I'm going to miss her.
Favorite series.  Sad it's the last.
Let's give it up for the writers, too.
SNL has sucked for 20 yrs..
It was a little different for me in 3rd class
I am 100% sure that at the 05:24 mark she's saying "Grabbing and f*cking, grabbing and f*cking", with the cigarette in her mouth muffling her words just enough to let the F- word skate by.  And why not?  Why not see what you can get away with on your last day at work? I'm sure it is a temptation for a lot of people who do live television. I don't think she did it to be a troublemaker. I think she was just having fun.
I am going to miss her on SNL.  One of the legends and she will always be remembered for these skits.  Wishing you all the best Kate!
I think 30 years from now people will be watching her like Dan Aykroyd, and Chevy chase, and Balushi. She's going to be a legend
Kate is an awesome comedian.👍🏾👆🏽
She definitely used a chisel to carve out her name on the wall of Studio 8H  Thanks for making the family laugh Kate  .
None of the people except Keenan is worth remembering. The cast of SNL is so Woke, they don't understand humor. I haven't watched SNL in about 6 - 7 years. I remember when SNL made fun of everyone in politics and did it with class.
I laughed and then I cried. She'll definitely be missed. I hope she has a wonderful rest of her career.
I’m gonna miss Kate so much. She’s an absolute legend and I will miss here dearly. I wish he all the best in her future endeavors
She quiet?or fire?
I'm gonna miss Kate and aidy Pete!! Legends
https://youtu.be/cajA22xnKOE Be careful of the things you say
No more Hillary Clinton.
I'm now calling my period panties my Wonderware 😂😂😂😂😂
Not the sign off for these comedians I expected. Skits were disappointing. Wish them well on their journey. Looking forward to to the next season of SNL
love you KATE!!! OMG!!!
If this was earlier SNL, they'd be making a movie about such a great character. A fitting way to leave the show, good luck Kate.
I am a youtuber hun mera ek channel hai nice video 👌💔
A true “do it all” comedic performer is once in a generation, and we were lucky to see 2 in a row with Kristin Wiig and Kate McKinnon. How lucky we were to see them one after another. Those two and Gilda Radner are the greatest female cast members ever and it’s not close.
Kate is leaving???!!! Come on man!! Whoever the next stand out cast member is supposed to be better stand out hard
NOOOOOOOOOO 😭😭😭😭😭 KAAATEEEEEEE don't leave SNL
No better way to open the end! God bless Kate McKinnon. I hope she continues to have a dynamic career.
Aside from the bummer of Dumpster winning in 2016, we missed the chance of to see her really take off as the HillBilly.
Bravo
I love this series :D
These strong independent western woomans are not funny . They are absolutely hideous!
I have more hair poking out the sides than a hipsters beard stuffed in a kn95 I’m sorry but I lost it 😭😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Why clean the house if there's no one coming over?
Going to miss Kate McKinnon so much.  Pretty much every sketch she does, is a bona-fide classic!  She will leave a huge stamp on SNL history, and leave a huge gap in the cast now that she has gone.  I do hope she returns every now-and-again.
Nooooo!!! Why is leaving? She was one of the funniest and brightest stars on SNL. Does anyone know why she's leaving?
Amazing!
What a tired joke
Kate is definitely one of the greats. She will be missed.
Not me that's crying over here 🥺🥺😭
Natasha Lyonne is an absolute ALL-STAR for not breaking there.
My most favorite skit of the last 15 years! Wishing Kate the best of luck, don’t know how SNL will fill the void she is leaving behind.
This was emotional! I love this skit. Kate will be missed!
*"I am the father."-👽*
kyle not getting a "cut for time" sketch on his final episode is the ultimate meta-"cut for time." nice work SNL, i get the joke.
🥺Kate
Damn she MADE SNL while she was in them, I know lots of you will have something to say about this comment but she was iconic. She will be missed.
I cried when her voice broke towards the ending 😢😢
who is the woman in the middle?
“Why clean the house if nobody’s coming over”…..I can’t with Kate McKinnon😂😂😅😅😅🤣🤣😆😆….Mike Day’s facial expressions and refusal to break character is epic😆🤣😅
My dong hole and my wrong hole….. brilliant!!
Oh no an unfunny person left an unfunny show.
god bless ya kate
My new life goal is to work "rips my nips" into a conversation
I can read the room, it's me, right? Thanks for staying awhile, Kate.
Made me cry.
Choked up🥹 Kate you am the best💛
I don’t even watch SNL and that made me cry .
hearing kate break at the end actually got to me  :( really gonna miss her on the show
These are some of the best skits ever. The way Kate goes in 100% on the role is amazing.
I haven't watched SNL since they started using canned laughter, this crap isn't funny. Maybe they will bring back Alec Baldwin to do Trump, oh I forgot he killed a person didn't he, well when Trump is President again Trump will pardon him, you think?.
Wwwwwwhooooooooooooooooooooooooo! Was the sound McKinnon's  vag letting out that queaf.
"Why clean the house if noone's coming over?".🤣🤣🤣
I am totally bawling at the end of this! Brava Queen Kate and THANK you for being such a LEGEND!!! Can’t wait to see where your career is going next and am looking forward to watching everything you put out!!!
That was hysterical!! 😂
To say the least, I’m so sentimental, I got hooked up w SNL thanks to her and bill Hader, so it’s pretty sad that she’s leaving but gosh she leaves a HUGE legacy🥹❤️
“Obviously not”
Kate is too hilarious 😂 😅😅😂
It's the most popular non funny tv comedy show ever  unsub snl
that endless stream of roaring laughter is exactly what KM deserved for her final day. here comes the bittersweet melancholy when you witness the end of an era…
I can't imagine the show without her.. she's an icon. Going to miss my weekly fix of Kate's genius ❤️
That's how you make an exit!!!
Love you, Kate. ❤️
Nooooo not kateee
😥
I"m not crying, you're cr... Ok, I'm crying. Leave me alone. God, I love Kate. So gonna miss her.
I she's a good actor, but didn't like her that much, she's too much. while Cecily Strong on the other hand us perfect, just perfect, even the new girls are better than Kate.
omg, I didn't know Kate was leaving SNL until I read the comments. What a poignant ending to the cold open!  I always loved these skits, and Kate is a comedic genius who brought so much to the show. She will be sorely missed.
Whaaaaaaaaat! She left SNL too.   Whaaaaaaaat the phk? Why?
Kate, Aidy, Pete, Kyle…man, some powerhouse people leaving right now. :( Thank goodness there’s still some amazing talent on here. Hopefully Cecily stays for a while, and we see more of Chloe Fineman!
Kate is funny asf
This is the most aggressively Kate has ever presented her vagina to the camera. She will be missed.
"More hair poking out that thing than a hipster wearing a KN95 mask..."  I DIED!
I am truly going to miss a woman I don't even know. It's a weird feeling. I didn't think I'd get so emotional, but seeing her tear up, made me tear up.  Bye Kate, I thank you for the smiles and the laughter! 🤍
"I can read the room" was precious
Kate was HILARIOUS. I don't watch the show as much as I used to, but she nails it every time I watch these.
Kate you are and always will be a legend!  Ms. Rafferty is by far my favorite character ever played on SNL. Thanks for all the laughs!
Omg  it's  a intelligence spaceEX leak...for  Kelly's  Ann
I LOVE Kate McKinnon but third time didn’t hit 😭
Kate is awesome, can't wait for her to to do some big things..
Proud to be a Terran!
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
What a appropriate nutty send off for her. Thx for the laughs
Like Esham said "what a way to go out."
One of the...         All-Time-MVP cast members!         And that group is very select.
Just realized in these skits, Kate’s doing a Dennis Miller impression
She got emotional there.  She’s gonna be missed!
BRING HER BACK AS A HOST RIGHT NOW.
We love you Kate, you'll be missed
Kate McKinnon is so funny. Maybe it's just the hair in this sketch, but she reminds me sometimes of Carol Burnett, other times of Mo Collins (a seriously underrated character actor), but she has definitely carved out her own space through her work and brought so much joy and laughter to people. SNL won't be the same without her. And since SNL has a cast of like 30 now, it won't be a surprise if they need to bring on a half dozen people just to try and replace the talent of this one amazing person.
Noooo! I didn’t realize she was leaving until I saw this skit 😭😭😭 Every headline I saw about this weeks episode was about Pete leaving 🙁
Fcking Legend!
too funny.  thanks Kate McKinnon.
Wow! What a send off and a departure! Kate McKinnon was quite an amazing host and I certainly wish her luck and great fortune in departure. Good show SNL, good show indeed.
Is Agent Fitzsimmons a reference to Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.
Kate is my favorite all time..  Her and Aidy crack me up. They both just sit there and try and get each other to lose it haha... ..  I can read the room it's me lol
FITZSIMMONS!!
Whoever wrote that "wonder wear" line 👏🏾👏🏾
MY DOWN THERE HAIR....
I’m crying
she had me crying at the end. im gonna miss her 🥺
"MY DONG HOLE AND MY WRONG HOLE!" A TOTAL CLASSIC AND EPIC CLIP SINCE THE 1ST ONE WAS EVER MADE!!! LOVE YOU CAST OF SNL!!! BIG RUDY I.L.W.U. LOCAL 13 WEST COAST LONGSHOREMAN LOVE!!!!!
I've been watching SNL since I could stay up late on a Saturday night i.e. the Dennis Miller, Jan Hooks, Nora Dunn etc. days and I can honestly say she's one of the best!! Going to miss you Kate. I shed a tear during the end part 👏🏽🎉😪
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
Farewell Kate and Aidy. 😭😭😭👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾you will be missed
These are some of my fav skits 😆
I am weeping
I have a feeling that when she comes back to host, we're going to see this character return.
2 send off in one episode 😩
You were too good for this world, Colleen.
Lover Her.. This one is going down in the books. Gave me chills. Amazing
OMG I cant believe I teared up at the knowing this was Kate's last season
So the host is in the cold open?
One of the funniest cast members of ALL TIME. 🙏🏽🙏🏽
By far, my favorite SNL actor! I’m going to miss her 🥰
How long until she can come back to host and will they do this sketch if she does lol
"My dong hole and my wrong hole" 💀
Between my wrong hole and my dong hole😅
All I can do is give this woman all the credit in the world. Any fan of SNL , hell anyone that's not a fan for that matter has to give this woman the props she deserves. Kate is without a doubt in the top 5 SNL alumni of all time. With all the huge names coming through that show for 50years, that is something. I was so happy to see that she did one more of these man and it just depresses the hell out of me that it's the last.  I'm gonna go outside and place my "dong hole and wrong hole" high in the air in her honor. Kate, you da man, woman, and all this new crap in between.
<3
kate..thanks for the good tears and now for the bad ones :)
The best always leave too soon.
Love Kate, and she will forever be missed. I’m literally so sad she’s leaving…
shes the best
Dong hole and my wrong hole...
Really gonna miss her on this show.  I hope she has some amazing things for the rest of her career.  So talented!!
Pete? Ok. Kate? Alright… Amy? No you fucking don’t you stay right THERE!
Natasha Lyonne looks like a middle-aged Rue McClanahan. Both are hot.
You will be missed on SNL Kate, absolutely GOAT
This https://youtu.be/Fpil5NGX404 is what happened #ThaDose Original Music.. Lucky
Kate, you’re brilliant!  Hilarious! Thee best!!  Always look forward to seeing you on SNL. Love Ms. Rafferty and so many other characters!  Wish you weren’t leaving but look forward to your luminescence in future projects. The world is a better place because you are in it.❤️
SO MUCH TALENT.
clapping in the beginning says this isn’t the final encounter
Oh.. my favorite cast member's gone! 🥲❤️‍🔥
This cast never got enough love or credit.... Especially the female cast members.
Well!!! My fav is gone!!! Good thing we now have Chloe and Heidi. 😌
😂🤣😂😭😭🤧
This is breaking my heart.
It's incredibly rare that write off a recurring character for when the actor is leaving. The only other one I recall is killing off Buckwheat for Eddie Murphy.
the Kate-est of openings, I expected nothing less from the legend herself. We'll miss ya sis!!!!
GOD'S STANDARD FOR HEAVEN IS PERFECTION AND ONLY JESUS (THE SON OF GOD/GOD IN THE FLESH) LIVED THAT PERFECT LIFE!  HE LAID DOWN HIS LIFE & TOOK THE WRATH OF THE FATHER ON THE CROSS FOR YOUR SINS!  GOD IS JUST SO HE MUST PUNISH SIN & HE IS HOLY SO NO SIN CAN ENTER HIS KINGDOM OF HEAVEN.  IF YOU ARE IN CHRIST ON JUDGEMENT DAY GOD WILL SEE YOU AS HIS PERFECT SON (SINLESS SINCE YOUR SINS ARE COVERED BY JESUS' OFFERING).  YOU CAN ALSO CHOOSE TO REJECT JESUS' GIFT/SACRIFICE & PAY FOR YOUR OWN SIN WITH DEATH (HELL) BUT THAT SEEMS PRETTY FOOLISH!  GOD SEES & HEARS EVERYTHING YOU HAVE SAID & DONE.  YOU WONT WIN AN ARGUMENT WITH HIM & YOU CANT DEFEND ANY OF YOUR SINS TO HIM.  YOU'RE NOT A GOOD PERSON, I'M NOT A GOOD PERSON... ONLY GOD IS GOOD!  WE'RE ALL GUILTY WITHOUT ACCEPTING JESUS' SACRIFICE FOR OUR SINS!    MUHAMMAD DIDN'T DIE FOR YOUR SINS, BUDDHA DIDN'T DIE FOR YOUR SINS, NO PASTOR/NO PRIEST/NO SAINT/NO ANCESTOR DIED FOR YOUR SINS, MARY DIDN'T, THE POPE DIDN'T EITHER, NO IDOLS OR FALSE gods DIED FOR YOUR SINS, NO MUSICIAN OR CELEBRITY DIED FOR YOUR SINS, NO INFLUENCER OR YOUTUBE STAR DIED FOR YOUR SINS, NO SCIENTIST OR POLITICIAN DIED FOR YOUR SINS, NO ATHLETE OR ACTOR DIED FOR YOUR SINS! STOP IDOLIZING & WORSHIPING THESE PEOPLE!   JESUS CHRIST ALONE DIED FOR YOUR SINS & WAS RESURRECTED FROM THE GRAVE!  HE IS ALIVE & COMING BACK VERY VERY SOON WITH JUDGEMENT (THESE ARE END TIMES)!  PREPARE YOURSELVES, TURN FROM SIN & RUN TO JESUS!  HE KNOWS YOUR PAIN & TROUBLES, HE WANTS TO HEAL & RESTORE YOU!  TALK TO HIM LIKE A BEST FRIEND!  ASK HIM TO REVEAL HIMSELF TO YOU & HELP YOU TO BELIEVE IF YOU DOUBT!  DON'T WAIT TO CRY OUT!  NO ONE IS PROMISED TOMORROW! HE LONGS FOR YOU TO INVITE HIM IN, HE LOVES YOU MORE THAN ANY PERSON EVER COULD, HE CREATED YOU!   Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."-John 14:6  "But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my  Father which is in heaven."-Matthew 10:33  “For the wages of sin is death (hell), but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord”-Romans 6:23
Are we losing both Kate and Aidy?!? No! Two of my favorites. I’ll have to watch reruns now to keep from being sad about it.
What a way to go out!!!  One of the best skits in SNL history and Kate left it all on the stage!!!
When you are able, in any given moment, to find the laughter, to find the love, your life as you have lived it through the filter of your mind, will be over. To know the self is to see the self, to see the self is to understand the self, to understand the self is to learn, to learn is to teach – this is the obligation set by each student as they walk the path to healing.
Is she leaving SNL? She is among the few reasons I watch their comedy clips, here in yt. Kate should be awarded with something like SNL hall of fame inductee or some sort of grand award for her outstanding performance throughout these episodes.   Gonna miss you big time, Kate McKinnon. Wish you a wonderful life ahead!
Is it only me or this wasn't funny?
That was an epic send off of an incredible talent.
God I'll miss her; She was one of my favorites!!!!
I love Kate!
😂
Aww is she leaving?
YAY! Great send off!
A few good jokes but it didn't compare to the other alien abduction skits.
Sorry to hate but Kate fell off. Compare this to the first one
“Climbing all over each other like my bush is the last life boat on the titanic” 😂 roflmao
Wow, Kate! You are the best! This gave me chills. Adieu, Earth being!! ♥️
oh holy sh*t... that was funny. There were too many quotes to pick a favorite. Outrageous!!!🤣😂🤣😂
I had no idea she was leaving. She is one of the most consistent cast members they've ever had. Never afraid to go all the way with a bit. I wish her all the best!!
Why does this feel like her leaving the show?
🤣🤣🤣 I’m gonna Miss her crazy ass
As much as I'm personally not a fan there is no doubt she is incredibly talented and has brought sooo much joy to soonmany people. Hope nothing but greatness for her future.
I can remember when this was a funny skit....I know, showing my age.
Laughing, but sad.
Still here for it!
Why is it always the best ones that we lose like this. 😔
Definitely going to miss her.
This bit means so much to me. My brother and I watched these all the time and he passed a year ago. Gonna miss this segment 😂❤️
One of these little bastards 😃
She did a great job of holding emotions in check and right as the door started to close we hear a slight break in her voice and I'm sure she let it out after. If not the best of SNL, she is in league with only a couple.
LOLOLOLOL!
I feel like this generation of SNL will go down as the unoriginal generation. They’ve stopped trying to branch out and do different things. How many times has Kate and Cecily done this same skit? 3 or 4 times now?
I never heard the vagina explained in so many different ways.
KM is national treasure. Will be sorely missed on SNL!
Kate: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The aliens gave her a Brazilian 🤣
Love her!
This final cold open sucked lmao
Time for a movie
SHYTS SO OLD,,,,NOT FUNNY ANYMORE,,,,SAME BASIC PUNCHLINES AND AL...
she exited as my favorite character.  it was beautiful.  all the best to her.
Brilliant,  Kate, simply Brilliant!!!!!
Kates leaving ???
It’s AWSOME, when the Lib bastion, hurt feelings, new SNL, basically shits on Middle America.    🙄
Didn’t know she was leaving. Didn’t expect the ending. Didn’t expect to cry with an opening.
more skits like this
The only thing missing here is Gosling  Kate deserves so much after leaving this show. One of the best cast members they've had
I’m confused. The aliens want to go to Uranus ?
“Damn… that fortune teller was dead on” haha so good
To whomever writes Colleen Rafferty's lines for Kate: *chef's kiss* 👩🏻‍🍳💋
SNL will not be the same 😞
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
Why everyone is missing Kate in the comments? Has she died???
Fair well miss Rafferty your one of my favorite snl bits.
I'm freaking crying
DID she say "dong hole and wrong hole"  ?????   SHE DID  !!!!
This segment is guaranteed to break somebody. McKinnon is dope
OMG, losing Kate is a massive loss. This cast has been SO amazing. Damnit...I hate to see any of them leave. Kate's portrayal of HRC on the piano, following the 2016 election loss, will always choke me up. I hope we see a lot of her.
Woooow. Almost cried. We love Kate 😘
Kate just had that it factor. Between this sketch and her gal gadot impressions it’s always a pleasure watching her work
I will never look at a hipster’s beard in an N95 in the same way again.
Another one Keenan has out lasted      you will be missed
SNL won't be the same without Kate
Lovely goodbye to one of SNL’s best. Can’t wait to see her host in the future!
The ovation for the sketch and the people in it is so heartwarming But damn it hurts that this Shit is dying lost everyone that makes me laugh man bittersweet
Kat is the show
Love you Kate.   Good luck
What?? 😆 🤣
I will miss the cast members who are leaving the cast. It has been a lovely few years with them. It really made me come back to SNL. <3
I didn’t know this was her last show :,) you were amazing Kate thanks for making me laugh till I cry! Can’t wait to see what you do next!
Kate is one of my all-time favorites.  Best wishes in all she does.  Thanks for all the laughs!
I honestly feel like I grew up with Kyle, Kate, Aidy, and Pete, I was 21 when they first started, and now I’m 31. Definitely feels like I’m saying goodbye to close friends.Thank you for all the laughs and comfort you brought during my 20s. All the best to some of my favorite cast members! 🥲❤️
So funny but the end got me emotional earth loves you 👽❤️
She carried SNL let's be real
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
Why clean the house if no one’s coming over….lol haha 😂
Hipsters beard in an N95😂😂😂😂.  Imma miss Kate. 😘
*End of an era. Another one of the greats retires. Good luck Kate, live long and prosper.*
Was this a send of to Kate. Absolute legend. Gonna miss you ...❤️
Omg I didn't realize that this was her last episode 😳 😭 ❤️love u Kate
Bittersweet tears! I can’t wait to see what’s in store for you ❤️
Awww…We’ll never get to hear about Colleen’s dong hole and wrong hole , coot coot and prune shoot  or her cheese trumpet and please hump it ever again. 😩😩😭 Kate McKinnon is a freakin comedy genius. She’ll be missed on SNL !! 💯💯 Buuuuut if you haven’t watched her in Joe VS Carol on Peacock, PLEASE DO. She’s funny asf in that too and plays Carol Baskin down to a tee !! So talented. Can’t wait to see what she does next !
the thumbnail is an automatic like for these videos. this series is fantastic.  edit: just saw from the comments that Kate is leaving. absolutely one of the greats...her next moves will hopefully be just as epic.
she's really good at what she does on SNL. hope she find future venues that are as suitable for her!
Going to really miss Kate. Amazing comedian.
The end of an Era 🥺
Funny as taking a dump on the wedding cake when nobodies looking!
😢😢😢My Baby Kate is leaving.. Definitely will be missed
I can't believe this is her last show! I'm going to miss her and Aidy. I hope they come back for some guest appearances. Or even to host. ❤️
Crying here too. I can't even imagine SNL without her. I hope she'll come back and guest host sometime. The end of an era.
Gonna miss her on snl sm 🥲🤍
the REAL STORY behind "alien abductions" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGRroNrNGso
Aww. I'll definitely miss Kate. Any skit she's ever been was always guaranteed to have me ROTFL. But with her career taking off like it is, greater things are going to happen for her. #IAm4everAKateMcKinnonFan
Hahaha "Play the hits", while, playing the hits...
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
Why clean house if no one is coming over? Lmao
You are a fuckin rock star!
All I gotta say is “ my dong hole n my wrong hole” where does she come up wit this shit… hilarious!!!! Love u Kate
What? Why? Kate too🥲🥲
Miss u already Kate.
This skit cracked me up I haven’t laughed that hard in a while. 😂🤣
She's one of the best SNL ever had, up there with all the greats. I met her on Park Avenue coming out of a smoothie place. She was dressing in some XL tracksuit, looked kind of nutty to be honest. I was close enough to say, "you're great" she looked at me with that lovely smile and said "well thank you!"
Awww, man! I didn't know she was leaving the show.  Damn - her impersonations were some of the all-time best.
Fitting send off for a remarkable lady. All the best Kate.
Yo why am I crying so hard dang
They're losing Kate AND Pete? But all the new ones are TERRIBLE. Chloe Fineman is the only good one. SNL is gonna have a rough time.
DONG hole and WRONG hole!!!
Yawn 🥱
She'll be missed on SNL, both her and Pete. Love ya both!
The last one?!
I am so going to miss her. One of my all time favorite ladies!!!!!
SNL Keeps doing this to us every so often… I know it’s weird, people move on… but we get sooo attached.   I’m gonna miss her trying and succeeding at making Colin Jost break.  Aidy too?!? NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!  …PETE TOO!?!
R.i.p. 😭💙 #forever💔
Had to pause it at "yeasty and beasty" cause I couldn't breathe from laughing
WAIT WHAT JUST HAPPENED?  IS KATE LEAVING?  OMG, I AM IN TEARS! ONE OF THE BEST TO EVER DO IT.
Nooo KATE she's like the best! Keep her on!!!
💔
Hard to believe this is Kate McKinnon's last show. I remember seeing her first show the night Kristen Wiig left SNL and Mick Jagger played the show out with Goodbye Ruby Tuesday. Man, Kate really was a truly unique standout on this show. No doubt she'll go on to do more great things. I'm looking forward to the day SNL makes her a host! Thanks for the laughs and smiles, Kate! All the best!
☄️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
PURE LIQUID AWESOMENESS 🖖🏽
She will definitely be missed.
Kate McKinnon, Kristen Wiig, Aidy Bryant, and Cecily Strong are some of my favorite SNL ladies
idk if I can watch SNL after Kate and Aidy leave..... they literally make this show what it is....
awe, the ending is sad
Any bets how long it will be before she comes back as host? Happy Trails, Kate, and thanks for the laughter.
I thought it was an oldie when I clicked this. I'm in a pleasant chock! Classic! 😂😂👽
Been watching SNL from the beginning. Sooo many greats. I’m tellin ya, Kate is on Mt. Rushmore. Yep, I said it.
**is sobbing**
Speaking of Legs 🦵😭MADAM close or cross you legs.  I can see  👀 your KOO KOO you nasty 🤢 girl🤢 … 🤣  Signed the Church ⛪️ Woman 👩
Thank you, Kate McKinnon for ten hilarious years!! You will always be one of my favorite SNL cast members. And when you come back to host, you doing Mrs. Rafferty again is non-negotiable!
Kate McKinnon is everything to this show.
Well thank God Colleen had on underwear this time lol even though they were too big
Aww the alien s finally took her for good. What a good send off 🥲
Bitter sweet, but the greats cant be kept to just Saturday.
Sooo is Kate leaving?!
awww... I hope she comes back to host often. Will truly miss her greatly.
New castings suck, can’t watch no more!
Thanks Kate for all the fantastic fun! I'm not crying! You're crying!
This show has already turned into an abysmal abomination of its former self. A 5 year car crash in slow motion. Without Kate and aidy?? Wow. Plus all the woke bullshit and unfunny hacks … get ready for the worst SNL season in history 😆 Lorne if you want to save the show … fire everyone. The boys club of yesteryear may not be pc correct but they were funny. And that is all that matters
im on a 20 light years trip through the cosmos. please account for time dilation.
This is so unfunny holy shit who writes this stuff
This actually made me cry. I have anxiety, ptsd, and adhd so falling asleep is hard for me. Watching SNL skits as a fall asleep gives me something to focus on other than the thought tornado. Kate McKinnon, for almost 5 years you have been able to help me fall asleep and quiet my thoughts. I've had four heart surgeries at 23 years old and every night before going to the hospital, I would watch you. Even when I was in the hospital, and it would hurt to laugh sometimes, I still watched you. This may be your last show as a cast member, but for me, your performance will never end. Take a bow Kate, and thank you.
“Pubicly speaking” I lost it
kate, you have made me laugh until i nearly piss myself in every skit you’ve been in, like the apple farm, the kmart, and especially the encounters. i’m heartbroken, but i know you’ll know amazing wherever you go next. from all of our hearts, thank you for making these dreadful years a bit better every sketch.
That made me want to cry when she said Live from New York it's Saturday night
As soon as she teared up I went to google her leaving the show.. it made me sad because she made me laugh to the point it hurt so many times.. I hope her next plan in life works out
Why does this feels like something thats going to happen soon
maybe saying "pluck'n" with a smoke in your mouth wasn't the best idea...
All of Kate McTalentless impressions are the same lesbian voice, Aidy Bryant is literally Horatio Sands "Carol" character, Pete is a nothing-burger w/cheese... and Kyle Mooney will be greatly missed.
“I got more hair pokin’ out the sides than a hipster’s beard stuffed into an N95.”
Miss Colleen Rafferty:  Ambassador to The Aliens from all Humankind.  Good luck on your next big adventure Colleen.  We'll all miss you!   Remember to keep your pants on, and don't let them bat your knockers too much.   😁🖖👽
damn, 4 people leaving, this next season might be a bit rough, certainly won’t be the exact same, but we still have Kenan, Chris, Cecile, Mikey, Alex and some newer members
WONDER WEAR!
KATE WE LOVE YOU! AN SNL LEGEND WILL BE MISSED
Kate you're the best!! Already missing your coot coot and poop chute! xxx
What will we do without Kate McKinnon?? She played all the best parts!!
Kate yall gonna have me crying all mf night long please tell me this is a joke 😓.
We’ll miss you!
I hope she fares better than the other "can't miss" players who leave. She's brilliant and always funny. It hasn't worked well for so many other that were the same.  I wish her well and look forward to supporting her in the future!
Good bye to someone who cheered me up when no one else could
Nod to Robin Williams????
How did Natasha keep a straight face???
i don't get what's so funny, i've seen all of these...and i'm not getting it...
Has anyone confirmed that she added some jokes that were not in rehearsal?  Those reactions were too priceless.  😂   The end of a magnificent era.  💗💗💗💗👽
Why clean the house if no one is coming over eh?
Kate real flexible with those legs got me wondering 😂
One of the best to ever be a cast member of SNL. Saturday Night Live is going to feel different without Kate.
🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️
They are going to have to make a dvd for Kate’s best skits. That would be fantastic.
Coot coot & prune chute
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
effin hilarious
So happy they went with this skit to say goodbye to Kate. Hilarious, it was such a proper send off for her.
OMG i came here to comment how excited i was about another alien abduction skit & then read all the comments about how this was kates last one :( now im crying, she will forever be so so missed!
OUTSTANDING LEGEND
good luck, Kate.  Cecily will still be there. she's an amazing talent,  as well
So many good cast members are leaving 😢 super bummer
Wait what!? She’s leaving snl!? Wtf!?
This was beautiful. Thank you Kate for bringing a lot of meaningful moments and happiness to people's lives over these years. It is more than you know. The world will never be the same. And there will never be another you.   So thank you for the times.  God bless you forever. And good luck on all your journeys; I know you'll do wonderful things.   I hope those little gray aliens treat you right out there.    Love and happiness, -a viewer of the past
I,l miss Kate she's the bessstt/tt
Mikey almost cracked at 3:42! 🤣
I wasn’t a huge fan of most of the stuff SNL does these days. The show took a weird turn in the last few years but this skit delivers every time. She’s so damn funny and this character is my favorite
I like watching Mikey Day's facial contortions as he tries not to break cuz of Kate!  Fitting--and touching--send-off!  We're sure going to miss Kate--comedy platinum!   I still miss Beck, though I like the newbies.
Great that they brought this character back. I thought they would have let Kyle do it, since he is also leaving.
I almost cried
Say it ain't so Kate!! Love you !  Be well and prosper!
Don't blame the aliens!!! I'm a bushman myself!!!🤣👍
7:34 I lost it when she lost it. What a legend. 😭
Kate was singlehandedly the best cast member for the better part of the last decade and she will be dearly missed. Hope she finds success in whatever comes next for her. She deserves all the best.
"so these two are hanging out with Doctor Strange and the multiverse while I'm left with the madness" is an underrated line, in my opinion. Gonna miss Kate
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
Good work great ending!!!
🥹🥹👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Kate has a sense of comedic timing that is a gift from god, she knew what was funny and exactly how to share that with her audience. She'll go down in SNL history as one of the all-time greats. The only saving grace to her departure is that she can come back anytime she wants! Thanks for all the laughs Kate!
Kate is a freaking GENIUS 🤣👍💜😍😄
No Kate don’t go!
Really gonna miss Kate on the show 😭
“I’m not giving up, and neither should you. And live from New York it’s Saturday Night.”  Kate said the words the country needed that night. I’ll never forget it as long as I live. The laughs and tears over the years are priceless. God speed Ms. Rafferty.
oh my gosh I had no idea she was leaving! a legend, I'll definitely miss seeing her
God damn, she's be missed
Talk about a legend.  This was an amazing cold opening and I’ll miss her on the show!
The alien should have  dropped a bowl.  And pointed.
That'll do, Kate. That'll do.
Funniest skit all year
Don't cry baby, we will miss you too.
They went all out for this one
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
@Lorne just pay Kate what she is asking for plus 10%.
Original Alien Encounter is my favorite SNL skit of all time. This is good stuff
May this comment reach who it needs to, God bless! https://youtube.com/shorts/rZo-vWTDVaQ?feature=share
Disgusting skit...
Consistent 11/10
Not me crying my eyes out right now omg bro
End of era. Kate will go down with Phil Hartman, Dana Carvey, Gilda Radner, one of the all-time SNL greats!
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
This made me bawl. She has made the last ten years a little more bearable.
She will leave quite a vacancy.
The way she ended it tho. ❤️
The Queen
When the aliens come to earth this is the first thing I’m showing them
You know a skit is epic when the audience wildly applauds right from the get.
As I was expecting Kate to go, I guessed that the show starting with that character would be meaningful. But of course, I had no idea how it would end, or how moved I would be. It reminded me of when she, in Hillary drag, played and sang "Hallelujah" the week that Trump won and Leonard Cohen died. She's a shy and private (albeit very openly gay) woman who rarely opens up in public. But we saw the real Kate there, I think.
The last episode for Kate McKinnon and she goes out on top with the close encounters skit.
My fav skit lmaooo
She could play Lindsey Graham
The only ones left good, Cecily, Colin, Michael and K. Thompson
Wonderful skit! Good Luck to ALL
Before I watched this clip I thought you know this could not compete with the past clips with Kate. But I was DEAD wrong.  Ty Kate much love
Kate is just amazing. It will NOT be the same without her.
Perfect sendoff.  She was one of my very few favorites of late.
TRUMP,TRUMP,TRUMP,TRUMP,TRUMP,AWAKING
“not to get too graphic but pubically speaking” lmao
Lucky aliens!  👽  Hope they swing by with her soon cuz this planet will be so sad w/o her!  Much love Kate! ❤
Forever. Our trivia team name is Danny Randall’s Twelfth Birthday.
Kinda phoned in this skit and several recurring in the show. Last show o’ tha season. Effit?
Kate was the only one keeping SNL on life support.
Ok, my eyes were teary at the end of this skit. Much love Kate.  A real GOAT!!
1st Cood Open that was funny since Matt Damon and the Supreme Court Justice hearings.
Kate and Kilda
Glad I’m not the only one who got emotional about this being the last time we will get Ms Rafferty. Kate McKinnon has always been my all time favorite on SNL. The last ten years she was the reason I watched it. I remember I saw a clip with her in it on YouTube and I HAD to watch the episode and that’s when I got into SNL. It just won’t be the same with her not there. :/ and then I was double broken hearted when I heard Aidy was done as well. 😞😭
I’ll be honest, I never found her to be funny.
I remember those lean years with a cast was horrendous and then she landed on that set with her pink pocket and her stink rocket in full view. I hope she lands guest hosting for the clam casino and a bean burrito right on that stage live from New York
Ahhh.  Kate’s send off skit.
No Biden opening? So much Biden material going to waste!
I am sooo going to miss Kate. She'll be around, right?
It was funny the first time around, then it’s just diminishing returns.
Same worn out shit as years ago.
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
Ready to go to lakes le .😅.
She deserved this send off, she’s been legendary on this show during her tenure.
OMG! I laughed so much I cried.
❤️
I guess the Kyle Mooney goodbye sketch was cut for time
I wish they could have had Ryan Gosling back for one more of these.
How I wish they brought Ryan Gosling even just for that skit.
What an amazing talent! Best of luck to Kate and I can't wait to see what she does next!!
She is definitely one of my favorite stars who started at SNL.  She is not that far behind from accomplishing what the rest of the SNL greats did.  Her future after SNL sure looks bright.
Great exit.Doesn’t look like Keenan going anywhere though.Dude enough is enough,Let Lorne hire another token blk guy yeeessshhhh
I’m so sad she’s leaving! She is a genius!!
😢👋🏽
😍😍😍😂😂😂😂
This made me cry, when Kate got on the spaceship to say goodbye I couldn’t help but well up in tears! She’s the GOAT!
Perfect send off for Kate.
Kate McKinnon had literally been a roll model for me, I wish her nothing but the best in the years ahead. 🥲
I haven't watched this show in years but that made me...hold my cocktail I will be right back!
One of the very few watchable moments from this newer age of SNL.. Sending off a Legend..
"My donghole and my wronghole"
LMAO
Kate is not to be replaced.
2:40 you mean the force.... 🤣
I'm going to miss her. I hope she makes guest appearances!
All the ladies are  ⭐️
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
my heart! feels like kate has been with the cast since the mid 2000s. she will be missed and i am sure she knows this! a true icon on so many levels.
Unpopular opinion but she lasted too long. She essentially became this generations Adam Sandler, forcing one schtick into everything she does
tired, re used tropes.
I'm gonna miss Aidy and Kyle. I'll be interested to see what they have planned next.
QUEEN
Well at least this time she had on her slacks
Awww Kate 😭 😭🥹🥲
NO!!! Kate you can't leave!!!   Geez..  not now..
"Why clean the house if nobody's coming over". Story of my life😂
When I saw her doing Olya Povlatsky 10 years ago I knew she had an extra level of talent
Kate is my fist reason for watching. The news desk w/Colin & Michael is reason  no. 2. If they stop that, may as well take off the air. Fear well Kate, thank You!💕🤣
I fell in love with her yrs ago. Then when she did the hallelujuah cold open and almost cried she became my absolute favorite of all time.  Always hilarious. I wish her the best. Just upset theres never gona be an ingraham angle sketch again....
Going to be a challenge to fill that spot.
Ok im really upset. I didn’t know that FOUR!!! of them are leaving SNL for good!! I feel blindsided!! Not ready to say goodbye to them
you will be missed
I will miss you kate
so glad her and pete are done
So funny. Will miss her on the show.
WOW!!!! That went from another hilarious and awesome segment to a very emotional sendoff for Kate!!!!!! Magnificent!
I am not ok with this at all y'all
I had no idea Kate was leaving. I think I’d come across the Pete news, but this threw me for a loop! I’m really gonna miss her!
Fitz Simmons? Who is the agents of shield fan in the SNL cast?
Just don't think Kate is that funny.   Iver the first couple of years she her characters were novel and her timing was excellent. And while I don't necessarily that's changed, it is always the same. Like, the jokes here are good, but they are the same jokes. Over and over and over. Every character is sexually charged and she can never commit to the bit.  However, it seems that the audience love her, so whatever. Breaking character isn't always funny to me. I expect actors to stay acting.
Kate we will miss ya, so so much.
It's the same feeling I got when Kristen wiig left.
Hi so I am obsessed with this show Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D and theyve been teasing us a bit about having the characters come back in some way.... the name "fitzsimmons" is a pretty unique name, and the name is pretty important in the show.... I want this to mean something, but it probably doesnt
Movie?
We ♥️ Kate!  Especially me. ♥️
When Kate had to hold her tears back at the end that got me really emotional lol
Gonna miss her
Ugh .i got so teary eyed. Kate McKinnon is the best 😭
Dang. That was sooo good. Love her. Will miss her on SNL.
4:45 So they went to Meow Wolf Convergence Station?
We will miss you on SNL, Kate!
God I’m gonna miss Kate so much, she was the absolute bomb. So talented and funny, and I’m so glad they’re doing this iconic skit series as a send off!
The world is Kate's.
Quite the sendoff for Kate, I'll miss her.  i felt like she definitely breathed new life into SNL during a boring time for me. Goodbye, Kate! We'll miss you!!
SNL sucks ANYMORE , they have so much material they can use and they don't , Ministry of Truth , Chinese Dissing Biden , Baby Formula , So much , SNL SUCKS !
Thank for everything Kate, blessings! The best for you!
So funny yet so heartbreaking at the same time ❤️‍🩹
Kate is hysterical! Awesome talent
Kate is far and away so much better than anyone on SNL
She plays this character so well. Love Kate McKinnon.
Well damn, how the hell did it get SO EMOTIONAL at the end. Well done.
Great season finale!
I owe Kate an immeasurable amount of gratitude for sharing a colorful variety of synonyms for vagina and anus. Whenever possible, I try to work a few into my lesson plan. The 4K kids absolutely love it!
I don't think I've ever clicked on a SNL video so quickly in my life. I love the misadventures of Ms. Rafferty
I ADORE Kate & Aidy! I’ll follow them into what ever career moves happen next for sure!
Those aliens walk like Zoidberg. Same planet maybe
The dumbest show ever..
God damn, Kate did not want to leave...
It’s so sad to say goodbye to Kate and Aidy. I had no prior interest in space travel, but if I need some good laughs, I’ll make a trip to Roswell, NM, and hope for the best. 👽🙃Miss you two already!  You’re both absolute legends.
Hahahaha…”why clean the house, if nobody’s comin over” I’m dying! Kate is hilarious! The best!
She is a comedy genius.  I'll miss her so much!
What kind of fake cigarette do they use for these kinds of theater productions? Lmao like I'm trying to think of things that can spew smoke like that without setting off l the detectors
watched
Going to miss Kate. She is so talented and hilarious!
Kate McKinnon is a national treasure. She is absolutely hysterical.
"That really rips my nips."
Missing her already 🥲
Not me crying at work, first from laughing, and then from the send off! You MADE SNL a great part of our viewing and will sure the missed!!
I waited so long for Kate to give us another Mrs Rafferty sketch, and now it makes me so sad that this will be the last one made, and she did not disappoint. It makes me cry and laugh from this gem... We will miss you, Kate, Aidy, Pete, Kyle, and Beck 🥺🥺🥺
Kate is hilarious in every skit she's in. I wish her all the success she can reasonably stand. Could feel the emotions from her goodbye 😭 This skit is the one 😂😂😂😂
Whose the AOS fangirl writing for SNL?that Fitzsimmons reference 🤌🏼
No... no, Kate...
Finally doing what she does best, and not Ghostbusters
I couldn’t work with Kate, I’d break character too much!😂
I'm so glad that God made her. And I'm glad that I was able to witness her talent in my lifetime. In this world of such sorrow.  She truly is a gift from heaven.  Thank You Kate McKinnon 👏🌷😌
I loved this sketch and I will miss Kate McKinnon and I hope she has a great time with new experiences
Excellent example of the inappropriate filth behind why I and many others ditched SNL in the 1980s.
I want the animated autobiography of Ms. Rafferty, captured in the art style opening of the Carol Burnett show and Heavy Metal.
“My dong hole and my wrong hole”! 😳😆😆(Kate)🤦🏽‍♂️
I'm crying.
SNL is about to suck without her
We will so miss you, Ms. Kate. your character was raunchy, edgy, and full of wisecracks with the nicotine coursing through your body and you nervously smoked it down to the filter with one quip after another..  Never say Never! You just may make a "special guest" appearance at some point in the future!    AND IT WILL BE SO EPIC IF YOU DO!  Best of luck to you, and thank you for all the laughs!!
WAIT KATE IS LEAVING?!?!?!
I held it together right to the very end, then the tears let loose.  We'll miss you Kate.  :(
Thank u kate 💓  its been real
how they literally didn’t die laughing 😂
Best one so far
Top 5: Bad Things to be with a RUSSIAN WOMAN... https://youtu.be/YSZ0VvFbu24
OMFG, hilarious , lol
Perfect send off. I don’t think I have ever laughed as hard as I did first time I seen original skit with Ryan Gosling hosting. I hope her hosting return includes a follow up with Ms. Rafferty on her travels.
Loved her since the big gay sketch show. I wonder what she's up to next.
Based on the comments, I am the only one out there that thinks she is not funny at all and can’t wait to see if they bring back comedy to this show. It is half her being the same character every single sketch and half the writing. Hopefully new writers are coming on, too.
She's on fire.  She made me actually blush this time.
Really got her emotion when she stood at the door.  Seems like a lot of talent is leaving this year.  Wonder what is happening, or if it's just coincidence.
Not funny
“Well that’s unfortunate” was overlooked
That ending is gonna play A lot hands down
Why is she leaving? She is my favorite...
Did she just talk about the devils pentagram? This show is getting more and more perverse as it goes on. 2:25  A pentagram is a five-pointed star, with all lines the same length and all angles the same. A 'pentangle', 'star pentagon', or 'pentalpha' means the same thing. It is a type of pentagon.
The only cast member since the originals that I gave a shit about! I'm sure she's gonna' continue to do great things.
LOL Aliens designed by Kim Kardashian Skims Closet… “Final Encounter with Pete, SNL Farewell.” SMH
Bet she's got some fire 🔥 💋
Kate's leaving??  But whyyyyyy????
Can Kenan go too?
I feel like an alien too. 👽
So excited for a new cast!
If I was asked to take one thing or person with me and say goodbye to this universe I would take Kate. How can you leave us :(((
My favorite cast of SNL, I love you Kate!
Kate is one of the greats no question.
“Why clean the house when nobody’s coming over”.  This has got me lmaorotf and truth!!!
Is Kate leaving on her own terms, or are they making her leave?
NOOOOOOO WERE LOOSING KATE 😭😭😭
kate is... amazing <3 11/10
“First time in my life I’m ready for bikini season!” Miss Rafferty is my favorite character and I’m sad this is her last appearance 🥺 We’ll miss you, Kate!
That was fresh!
She was choking up and eyes watery!! Love her to the comedy moon 🌝
Why clean the house if noone is coming over. Lmao. Kate is so funny in the most gross way. Lol
Wow. One hell of a goodbye. On her terms. In one of her favorite sketches. You are the greatest, Kate.
Kate will be back to guest host for sure just like many other SNL legends!
Definitely going to miss her. She was one of the most talented cast members this show ever had.   I'm not crying, you're crying!
I’ll miss Kate McKinnon on SNL as much as I missed Gilda Radner or Eddie Murphy or Steve Martin. She’s brilliant.
Noooooo!!! Foes this mean this skit is ending???!!
Thank you Kate…great farewell to her and well deserved…best wishes
The funniest part is Aidy trying to keep it together.
i was so confused why this was the cold open and then 7 minutes later i'm sat here crying
🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭
Kuz.. See Now.. That Really Rips My Niips.. (Ctfu)..
Crying myself to sleep
Kate McKinnon is in the running for best SNL cast member ever. Definitely top 5.
Kate McKinnon is definitely one of the most versatile and talented performers that ever worked. She gave us all 10 glorious years, and I loved every skit she did!
I wasn’t aware that libtards still watch this?  Pretty pathetic to even call this comedy.  LETS GO BRANDON………
Kate what ever you do from here…. I’ll be watching🥲🫶🤣🥰💛
I’m seriously so sad that Kate, Aidy and Kyle are leaving. I knew it’d happen eventually but I’m still not prepared 😭
Ron White has to be her comedic inspiration for these skits
Love you, Kate. You're right up there with Gilda. A true legend!
*so upset to see kate leave, i wish her all the best :(*
I'm so happy they did another one of these!! They're my favorite!
“why clean the house when nobody is coming over” AMEN
What an amazing send-off for The Great Kate ❤️
She absolutely killed it at SNL! Definitely one of my favorites in the cast in the last 10 years! And this character will live on forever!
Kate is absolutely incredible
Not me bawling my eyes out.  Kate you will be missed.
omg AoS reference
Thanks Kate, glad you got a proper sendoff. Gonna miss you something fierce.
You know all the "alien abduction nuts" hate this skit 🤣🤣🤣
love you so much Kate!!! all the best for you!! this sketch was so funny and sad at the same time.  xx
Kate-it won’t be the same without you.😥
That was best send off with one of the most outrageous yet unforgettable character.
im gonna miss those players!!1
Earth is gonna miss her
"That really rips my nips!"  Live long and prosper, Kate!
Just your daily reminder. SNL is not funny. MAD TV was way better. That is all.
I'm Going To Miss You Ms. Kathryn McKinnon Berthold!!!!!
Idky I’ve been waiting for this 👋🏽😭
Kate is so talented.  I’ll miss her the most.  Whenever she came on, I knew it was going to be funny
Holy crap, her 'Live from New York' killed me. :( Thank you for so many laughs, Kate. You are a legend!
This decade has seen the loss of so much comedy, especially in 2014, 2016, 2020, and 2022. Now, in a sad way, I'm reminded how lucky we have been. And maybe we'll be ok, knowing there are still legends like McKinnon around. And she ain't done yet.  We'll miss ya.
"Why clean the house when no one is coming..." omg 😅🤣😂 I hope chole can step up to  entertain us at Kate's level
that skit premise is just the best! Kate is legend. That ending got me in my feels! Queen will be missed!
The best. Not since Gilda Radner has anyone captured my heart like Kate. Simply brilliant.💫
Ill miss you Kate- make tons of movies and $$$$$
😂😂😂
Hillary Clinton has left the flat earth baby!
Someone is Paying attention to our comments!! Thank you SNL!!!
Snl will definitely not be the same without Kate. Stole virtually every sketch she was in.
I love that Kate is trying to break everyone lol
I'm gonna miss her.  She sure knew how to get a laugh.
I love that they brought this act back. One of my favorite skits laugh every time. Hope it's not the last. I would love to see one of the abductees have a crazier story than her as an ending
You Brought it BACK!!!!! Thank you!!!!! 😁😁 "Like my bush was the last life boat on the titanic" 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😆🤗
I somehow missed that Kate is leaving SNL and it only became clear at the end. Had me tearing up. She'll be missed!!! Thank you Kate for so many laughs, you are definitely one of the best in SNL's history.  I'll never forget the feelings I had listening to the Election Week Cold Open in 2016. Wishing her all the best!
Hey I bet  Rafferty was happy just having pants on the ship.
I WANTED ONE LAST ENCOUNTER AND IT HAS BEEN GRANTED
Sucks that Gosling couldn’t be here for the final chapter.
Kate kept that show afloat, she is a great talent.
Good Lord Jandice. I love you so much. I’ve been Crying for hours 😭
Kates so cute. You just want to hug her.
She's been one of the few ppl carrying SNL for a while, sad to see her go. & Ppl Pete is leaving too? Like thats their 2 biggest hitters they got lmao. SNL finna go even more downhill
Genius
Job well done , Kate!!!
Well there goes my only reason for occasionally watching this show anymore
We love you!!
I'm really gonna miss her coot coot! 💔 thanks for the laughs, Kate❤
👍👍👍👍👍. Going to miss my fave ❤️
Hilariously funny! Lol.
My hairy squatter!!!!! 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
This needs Ryan Gosling. Again...
Wait no Kate no you don’t gooooo
aliens are fallen angels, not angels. disgustingly vile programming that is blatantly obvious. He who has hears let him hear!
fitssimmons??? Marvel nerd here!!!!!!!    YEAHH!
Made me cry.... 😭
Classic
She will be back for smokes.
I am crying!!!! What a BOSSLady Kate has been, absolute LEGENDS and what a touching Kate type of ending to this epic period at SNL. For the record, Notorious RBG is forever linked with Kate also, huuuge kudos to her and the cast for holding up during the whole Trump era U.S. insanity, as a European SNL reassured me that at least not the whole country had fucking lost it's mind ! Thank you SO much for all the laughs, much love and all the best to you all!!!! 💓
❤
Ugh tears and laughs all at once
Legend! Long live Kate McKinnon! Best wishes
@2}----
I love it already and just began watching
Never thought I'd be getting emotional at the end of one of these abduction sketches, but HERE WE ARE.
Why clean the house when nobody's coming over right?  Damn straight Kate
Uh Oh!  More Alien High Jinks!  I hope they let her come back to earth to give us more of her “detailed updates!”
She’s leaving? 😭😭😭
When you leave, take the stupid & ILLEGAL TOBACCO DRUG with you, too!
Love u kate
This may be the perfect sketch. An outstanding send off for one of the all-time greats and yet ANOTHER skit that is hysterical, in an era when recurring characters stopped really being a thing. Chef’s kiss.
It's ok . Good luck to kate
"like a dog when its owner comes home, okay? it was bedlam" 🤣 such an underrated line & delivery of it. damn snl isnt going to be the same without kate!
Kate's schtick is growing thin. Just sayin, the spot light is aging and wee Kate has been massively overexposed on SNL. I can't recall another celebrity who I wish HADN'T come out. She actually makes being SOOOO out SOOOO annoying.
One of my favorite SNL performers in one of my all-time favorite sketches. Thanks for sharing your talent!
Perfect ending for her SNL career!  I think I spotted tears!  Can't wait to see what she does next!
Happy tears and sad tears. What a way to end. You will be dearly missed 🖤
Wow, that live from NY will be ICONIC.
Had me outright ugly crying 😢
Bye Kate! I love you!
All hail....
LMFAO SNL is a sh!t Show! Hasn't been since the 70 's.
🤣  why clean the house when no ones coming over lmao  I live in Kentucky and she is spot on 90 percent of the people here 🤣🤣🤣
Amazing send off. The only way it could’ve been improved, if Ryan Gossling came back for this one.
If I had 17 wishes, one would be to hug this woman for 5 minutes. My favorite of all time.
I'm of the popular theory that Kate's character is resistant to the aliens drugs and see's everything that's actually happening.
Can't she please hang on for a few more seasons maybe just wait until I die?! This punk better guest host. I want Steve Martin Tom Hanks level guest hosting from her! P.s. all the love in the world. Will miss you greatly.
Gosh I'm crying.
She said yeastie and beastie. 😂
- How do they keep a straight face?  Especially the guy.
Gawd I Effin love Kate!!! “No use of cleaning the house if no one’s coming over” *snickers*
Weird, I just found the Close Encounter skits a few days ago, the ones with the aliens cracked me and litteraly 2 days later I see the last one? Kate McKinnon is prob my fav from SNL, shame we wont get to see this caracter in the future.
They will NEVER,, but NEVER find somebody who can replace her, but I do hope they come somewhat close. Funniest person on TV for many many years! Sort of a Gracie Allan, Lucy, Mary Tyler Moore, Ellen Degeneres all kneeded together into one funny but tasty Tootsie Roll.
I love Kate she's one of the funniest people on SNL She'll be missed, but I hope she has independent projects because I'm not ready to stop laughing!
really solid send off for Kate McKinnon.  I, for one, am excited to see what she'll go on to do!
I love them all but for me Kate McKinnon makes my  Top 10 SNL cast members of all time.  I know that there's a lot of legends in there and I'm not sure who has to come off my list....but Kate was just that damn good.  The Alien Encounter sketches are  some of my favorites of all time.
We will miss Kate. Can’t we keep,her?
I'll really miss her
Awww this is so 😭 will miss you Kate! That's a nice tribute to her!
Kate is halarious🤣 will definitely miss her, and this sketch. Totally classic!
Kate is a Jewel , an amazing amazing performance !!!!!!
Kate you made my Year
LOVE YOU KATE!! PLEASE DONT GO!! LOVE YOU!!
Literally sobbing rn
coot coot and prune shoot! LMAO
Gonna miss you, Kate   May your star shine bright wherever you go.
Going to  miss both Kate & Cecily perform together.  Great chemistry and needed them performing together a lot more. Great holding it together by Natasha. Wonderful, fun and emotional sendoff. Cecily looked like she was about to cry.
Kate is so damn hilarious!
First I couldn't breathe laughing so hard now I'm bawling my eyes out. That's sooo sad I feel like I'm losing Micheal all over again 😞
I cried when she stepped on that ufo
Did she say dong hole, and wrong hole?! 🤣🤣
I’m calling it now SNL in about 4 or three years will give her a cameo and she comes back for one episode
I'm gonna miss her 😢
Kate McKinnon will forever be my favorite cast member to come through SNL 💕
This is wicked. And I love that Natasha Lyonne is in this
Kate we'll miss you and follow you wherever you go - funniest gal on the show, and wish you the best.
She went out with a Bang..  Best one ever..
Is that an Agents of Shield reference???
Maybe Kenan Thompson is next,
RIP SNL
Great job Kate
"A hipster's beard stuffed into a n95 " Perfect
I think this is a perfect send off 🤣
I fucking balled my eyes out 😭 wtf!
I laughed. I cried. I waved the brilliant Kate goodbye.
Bawled.   Just bawled.  Thank you, Kate.  And Aidy.  And Kyle. And possibly Che?!  And even Pete, though he hasn't really been on this year, or any of his time there. But SNL saved his life.  The rest of the cast saved all of US over the years.  Stay Che!  And best of the best to the rest of the graduating class. BRAVO! 💐
I could tell by the ending of this skit that this was meant to be her send off of the show, the way she turned around and got emotional.  Went to the comments to find out I was right.
This makes me SAD!
i cant believe those 3 greats are leaving! SNL will NOT be the same ; ;
I really did not expect to cry.
Godspeed Colleen Rafferty!
There goes one of the funniest and greatest cast members this show ever had. Godspeed Kate.
I remember her first two skits like yesterday: the Australian dog lady and Penelope Cruz with Sofia Vergara in a Pantene commercial directed by Jason Sudekis. Refrigeratoooor!
Kate McKinnon is the best comedian  SNL has ever had
So so good for a decade. Thank you Kate for outstanding "work."😁😅🤣
I've had 2 very up close alien encounters but no physical contact (that I remember) and nothing like these experience.  No damage, no insight but I know for sure they are here.  It's fun to get to laugh at the situations with Colleen and her tooter and fluter.
Ending is heartbreaking 💔
"My dong hole and my wrong hole" ... no one can deliver such eloquent writing like Kate can. We'll miss you, Kate!
And so ends one of the greatest SNL recurring skits of all time.  'Classic' doesn't even come close to describing this hilarious masterpiece of comedy over the years.
Why clean the house if nobody’s coming over? Fkng hilarious
Kate is absolutely phenomenal!  Touched my heart in the end as I didn’t know that she was leaving after this season.
boo
Fitz-Simmons...?... like from agents of sheild?
One of the best to ever grace SNL!  So naturally funny and talented!
Had me in tears from beginning to the end. One of the greatest SNL cast member . Gonna miss Kate
Goodbye Kate. I love you! I can't wait for your next big thing!
As I'm thinking to myself, "I wonder how her pants come off in this one?" In that split second they were already off! lol.
Kate pulled no stops on this sketch!😁
SNL hall of fame status. Can’t wait to see what the future holds for Kate ♥️ I’ll miss her, but excited for all of her comedic genius to come.
SNL will not be the same
natasha was a great find , she is so funny, i watched russian doll cause of her.
Such a talentless cast. Worst ever. Nothing funny. Give me 1992 with Chris Farley, Mike Myers, Dana Carvey, Jan Hooks, Tim Meadows, Kevin Nealon, Victoria Jackson, Chris Rock, Julia Sweeney, Adam Sandler, Phil Hartman, David Spade, Rob Schneider, Norm MacDonald, Michael McKean.
Kind of a gross scene. Just don’t understand the crappy direction they are taking thinking this was so funny.
Kate has to be in the SNL Hall of fame. Great talent!  Will miss her!
Total respect for the best N95 joke we might ever see.
I watch every week and didn't realize Kate was leaving the show until the last minute of the skit. Immediate tears.
Can't believe so many greats are leaving.
The end of Kate McKinnon’s run on the show hits hard, despite knowing she would eventually leave SNL someday. She is probably my all time favorite cast member and it won’t be the same without her. I wish her the best in wherever she’s headed next.
Dead at “why clean the house if nobody’s coming over” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
God bless
Yay, my favorite recent sketch returns! 😊
Fizz semen is his name??
🙇 My Queen
Truly one of the most talented people to ever grace the stage of SNL. Seriously Gilda level. G'bye Kate. We'll see lots of you to come.
That made me more emotional then i thought I’d get. Love you! ❤️🌈
Where are the jokes? Never found these funny.
Dong hole and my wrong hole. 😂
Is she leaving?!
That space between those spread out legs has gotten a little fatter over time…
I admit she has some crazy, funny acting skills, but it would have been so much better if the skit were not based around her genitalia.   I think it is in poor taste.
I love SNL but why do they have to have people smoking. Kids watch SNL. We do not want to advertise smoking.
KATES LEAVING TOO??? I JUST CAME HERE FROM WEEKEND UPDATE WITH PETE!! I need to go cry.
We love you Kate
This is one of my favorite skits on SNL, so glad they made another. MAKE MORE-Hilarious!
Perfect
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. Believe in him and you will be saved and go to heaven!
Why clean the house if no one is coming over….thank you Kate
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
“I always felt like an alien on this planet anyway.” Famous last words.
Just saw CNN do a blip about UFO's,  that & this sketch explains so much. We traded Katie for tech & real talk, now expecting a lot for the trade.💜💜💜💯
I have tears in my eyes. What a beautiful and funny send off ♥️🙏 All the best to you Kate!
Now I'm crying..great.
And now SNL will go back to not being funny again!
Her "Dong-hole and her Wrong-hole?! Who wrote that in!? LMAO
I just pee'd a little.
i'm like jane curtain gilda ratner old school but i swear , Kate is definitely one of my Main reasons for rockin' with the new school cast,,- beast mode in Every skit
This was x -files meets sex & the city
Long Live The Alien Abductions, Kate Is A Genius
She is just wonderful.
Kate is a living legend in comedy!❤❤ All skits with her was Top tier.
Why did she leave? She was the rock of this casts’ foundation
Caution, eating while watching this is not recommended
Good luck kate in your future
“My yeasty and my beasty”
👽👽🛸🛸
Planet Earth loves Kate ❤️
I'm crying rn omg!!! >_< Her voice kinda broke when she said that last part, WE LOVE YOU KATE <3
Wow... What an excellent send off sketch!
Aww man she almost cried giving the cold open
We love you so so much Kate! Thank you for everything!
Good luck and God bless to one of the funniest people on the planet. Looking forward to see what her next adventure is!
“Play the hits” indeed
Everyone's jumping ship
"Dong hole and wrong hole"  Fucking brilliant.
You're not crying, *I'm* crying.  Wait...  *I'm* not crying, *I'm* crying.  No.  *I'm* crying.  K. Fine.
Ms. Kate McKinnon Aka Miss Rafferty and so many other great characters she portrayed will Miss You
.."...why clean the house if nobody's comin',right?.."   lol lol lol
😂👍❤
We're missing Ryan Gosling here...
Everyone talking about Kate in this skit but Aidy is leaving too.
dong hole and wrong hole!  zdorovo!
Kate’s energy was different in this sketch
Jfc this was a great swan song for McKay
🥲😪
That was THE PERFECT send off
I'm more than 101% positive she isn't done with it, keep an eye on this one...Thanks for the laughs, she's defiantly one of the greats to remember!
Absolutely love recurring sketches with this being one of my favorites. Thank y'all for doing this again; I smiled the whole time! :) Didn't realize until the end that Kate would be leaving, but she surely won't be forgotten. Can't wait for a guest appearance or tribute in the future and the return from the aliens! 👽❤️
I want to make love to Natasha's voice. It's not just me, right?
"that really rips my lips."
One of the best Devils in comedy!
Kate Mckinnon is so fantastic. So many characters, so many laughs and she will leave a void in SNL that nobody will ever fill.
WAIT, KAITE IS LEAVING?? NO, NO, TOO SOON.  THAT IS WHEN THE DARK DOORWAY OPENS. WE ARE NOT READY.
MY DONG HOLE AND MY WRONG HOLE 💀
Kate leaving is a massive loss
Kate!
I just about cried
That was very sweet I'll admit.
Kate is one of a kind… no words! 🙏🏻😃
Farewell, Ms. Rafferty. It wasn't her worst Thursday...
I legit shed a few tears on this.  Kate is one of the greatest SNL people ever.
Are you ready for Heaven? Have you ever lied, stolen used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God's law, you're guilty. But wait, God loves you, he made a way out. God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16 Please think about it. Repent/believe before the rapture, before the one world government. Jesus died for you,live for him. Love U
Look at me! Am I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.Gal1:10 Please think about it. Repent/believe in Jesus Christ. He died for you live for him.
Anyone who says women aren't funny needs to be tied to a chair and forced to watch Melissa McCarthy doing that press secretary dude and Kate McKinnon doing pretty much anything.
Oh man I'd feed Pete Davidson to a pack of hungry hyenas if it meant Kate could stay!!
I love Kate McKinnon she's the main reason they keep this sketch alive
I'm not crying. YOU'RE crying.
Oh man. Love you Kate!
3:35 😃Here here! 😰I mean... I'm, highly hygienic. Tha-...that's important.
These encounter skits are my favorite of all times. What I would give to have a tv series of that!!!
😄
Went straight from laughing out loud to crying 😭
SNL loves beating sketches to death. Kate sucks. SNL sucks.
Special Agent FitzSimmons 🤣😂 iykyk
Coot coot & prune chute. Fun bun & mud gun. Drainer & stainer. Cooter & tooter. Hog taker & log maker. Grassy nole & gassy hole. Bush & tush. Taco & choco. Pink pocket & stink rocket. Fuzzy & scuzzy. Baby tunnel & gravy funnel. Please hump it & cheese trumpet. Clam casino & bean burrito. Dong hole & wrong hole.
Nooooo Kate - don’t leave!! 😢
Got to love how this sketch just knows to start off with Kate hanging back for a brief moment. Give the rest of the cast some time to develop relations with the audience. Build that tension up. Before McKinnon just "swoops" in and steals the rest of the show!😂
Her departure leaves an enormous hole in the cast. I feel sorry for the poor person they bring in to replace her. It's an impossible task.
wow
Gahhh, that was awesome!  Yay Kate!  And good luck in your future endeavors.
Definitely cried at the end  😭🥰
I would 100% agree Kate McKinnon is a damn funny legend
Wait, what...?
From here forward, you just know that Kate is going to be thinking of nicknames for "her coot-coot and prune shoot" and think, "Damn, wish I thought of that back when..." Thank you, Kate!
Thank you Kate
is Kate leaving SNL ? nooh.......ill miss you Katey girl...thank you for everything
Omgg she is really leaving
Perfect.  Thanks for the so many laughs Kate.
My heart is broken. Kate is most amazing snl member.
Hipster, N95, Clean House, I can't stop laughing
Kate is one of the all time ledgends of this show!
The ending got me all chocked up 😢
This show stinks
Thank God Kate is gone! No more shit like this!
Ug...I was blissfully ignorant of Kate's departure, and now Aidy too, this is going to be a rough next season without those two, hardly can imagine the show without the most powerful duo in SNL history!
Wasn’t there another one of these recently
SNL IS done  without those girls  ,  change writers they sucks
"..hipsters beard..".. I'm dead and GONE🙏🏼!!!!
I didn't even know she was leaving. I figured it out at the end of this. What a way to an make exit! I actually cried. I hope this beautiful, brilliant, funny-as-all-get-out woman comes back from the cosmos to take over the world.
Will not be the same w/o Kate. Massive talent ........
I have tears streaming from laughing so much. Kate is the BEST since Gilda.Wrong hole and dong hole! Yeasty and Beasty. Rofl
I think that someone I heard before said that they aren't going to watch SNL anymore because all they do is talk about everyone's family and I might not watch it anyway
Dang it Pete you effed it up and stole someone who really ran that show!Your alright but shit watch out for the kersdash curse?That shit is real besides we all know Julia fox is your age and well shit that broad is just getting those cobwebs cleaned out👊👊👊👊🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🥹McKinnon we are gonna miss you❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
this is a send-off in style..
Thanks for the laughs guys
It feels like Kate McKinnon has been carrying SNL for a while.  Those are some big shoes to fill! I am excited to see what she does next, now that the world is her oyster.
Anyone else tear up seeing her leave? She is so amazing.  She will never be replaced.
Boy, I'm going to miss seeing her on this show. 😢
sorry to see Kate go, I put her up there with Gilda, Bill Murray, John Belushi, Phil Hartman and Eddie Murphy
5:25 Last day of work, Kate accidentally slips a few f-bombs and nobody is the wiser.  We'll miss you, Kate! Thanks for all the belly laughs.
Bless Kate for giving us so many years of laughter and what a way to do it with an iconic sketch like this. May her Alien like ways of uncertainty humor carry on.
Good episode. How mamy Rafferty encounter skits were there? 5?
Is this a New York thing @ 0.23 seconds  He says "yous three" but on CLOSED CAPTION it reads "You Two"...... IS " YOUS TWO" A NORTHERN THING? 😀
Kate I be missing you!
If Kate ever has a talk show, it is definitely one talk show I'd actually want to watch. She's the best.
If Kate ever has a talk show, it is definitely one talk show I'd actually want to watch. She's the best.
Kate McKinnon has been my absolute fav on SNL! Hope to see her a lot in the future on other projects.
Kate Forever!
She was always my favorite we'll miss ya.
Will always love and miss you Kate , Aidy, Pete and Kyle ☹️🙏
Hands down my fav sketch of all time!🤣🤣🤣🤣
I would be one of the grays mocking the Hooter
Why are they leaving?
Her comedy sketches were one thing.  Her cover of Cohen's Hallelujah after the 2020 election was amazing.
The ones who are talking about my "unshaven house" are the ones hacking my phone. Those are the ones i'm gonna take to the court, and they'll make me rich as well. So, keep talking....The more you do, the richer i'm gonna be - for that reason as well. Justice is coming.  Prevedite si.
Kate McKinnon has been on "Saturday Night Live" for 10 years.
Why is she retiring?
🤣 😭🤣😭😭😭🤍
I’m not crying, it’s just alien 👽 piss falling down on my face from their dong holes in the sky..
Thanks Kate, for everything!
Awe I am soooo sad that Kate is leaving! She is a rare talent and I wish her the very best life!!
I know everyone is talking about how awesome Kate is (which is true), but can we appreciate the Agents of Shield Easter egg?
“Colleen this might be the most stable relationship you’re ever had” 🤣😵🥀😹
Great send off. One of her best characters and perfect for our period in time.
Hard to see people go when they've made us laugh as hard as Kate and Aidy have over the years.
I've never heard the phrase, "Why clean the house if no one's coming over." Couldn't stop laughing.
I keep telling my wife wonder ware are a thing. She keeps asking if wiping is optional. Thank you Ms. Rafferty
Thank you Kate for making us laugh (and bringing us joy) for these last 10 years. We'll miss you.
"pubicly speaking" lmao!!
I hope Kate’s exit from the show is for real this time. Proving women can not be funny one terrible skit at a time for 10 years!!!
SNL will not be the same 🥲
I almost cried when she choked up....host soon kate
I missed the monologue and started on this skit not knowing it was her final episode now I'm in tears and thankful she saw this set of skits through to the end I love you so much Kate and I hope only great things come your way from here!!! 😭😭❤❤
Dong hole wrong hole
I wish they could've gotten Gosler back for this last one. It's always funnier watch him try not to lose it during Kate's parts
I’m not cryin - you’re cryin!
Ill miss ya Kate. Thanks for all the laughs. Cya on your next adventure
I cried.
That was so epic and boss
*Eminem looks GOOD🤤❤️*
Kate,when is your spinoff?
Had no idea this was going to be it for her. She’s a legend. She was one of the few cast bright spots these past few years and I’m going to really miss her. Thanks for the laughs Kate!
she will be missed
Pete AND KATE???!
Kate was the only cast member who was remotely close to filling Kristin Wiig's shoes.
"why clean the house if no one is coming over?"  kate will be sooooo missed
As long as she doesn't go back to doing Verizon sketches...
You could tell Kate was holding back emotions as she stepped into the alien spaceship. And that's a really weird sentence to write.
more hair poking out the sides then a hipsters beard stuffed in a N95.. hey why clean the house if no ones coming over right? LMAO She is going to be so missed. Why I got back into SNL past 5 years or so is leaving sadly.
She did this character so well....will be missed
A disgustingly hilarious performance that also manages to tug at the heart strings at the end! Gonna really miss Kate McKinnon, she was a shining star of the roster SNL (the women have been carrying the show these past few seasons!).    Best of luck of your future endeavours, Kate, I know Hollywood will continue to make you a star!
Why did this remind me of the newest AHS season
If SNL didn’t turn into a one way leaning propaganda machine, it would actually matter to more people that Kate was leaving.
The GOAT of her era
I always ROFL 🤣 with this sketch 😂 can’t believe the strength it takes to keep a straight face doing the sketch
I didn't realize that she was leaving until just now.  I'm 55 years old, I've seen them all and I have to say I think she's certainly one of the very best.
Awe
Way to go out, Kate!
One of the finest ever! The best for her.
It´s Great Kate Again!!!
She's one of the best they've ever had. I hate to see her go.
OMG, I cried.
So happy they brought this skit back
What a legend 👏👏👏
Damn…didn’t know this was her last season. SNL Legend for sure!!
were gonna miss you so much kate! 😢
<3
SNL will never be the same without Kate. One of the All-Time greats for sure! I hope she finds another show that will highlight her incredible talents.
Shes one of the few reasons I watch...Thanks Kate for the laughs😊
Well that was tragically sad. I was wondering why Kate McKinnon was so muted in her delivery.
Natasha is giving off Blanche Devereaux in this and I LOVE it
"Why clean the house if no ones coming over" I literally spit out my water on that!🤣😂🤣😂
Natasha needs to play Dolly Parton asap
I was just watching the old alien encounters last week...I can't believe she's leaving :(
Man this guest was really bad.
Kate McKinnon will be sorely missed on SNL, but has made herself a place in the Pantheon of Legends  You are an absolute treasure, Kate
I'm going to miss Kate McKinnon and Pete Davidson so much, SNL won't be the same without them.
"Why clean the house if no one's coming over.... " Perfect... YOU GOTTA LOVE HER....😏
Why am I tearing up?
Wait so she is leaving foreal?!?! 😣 i was so happy when she returned the last time. My comedy emotions cannoy handle this departure. She has always been my fav. She takes over any skit she is on.
Kate will be missed!!👏👏
Thanks for staying a while and thanks for the laughs Kate McKinnon!!!
That ending moment is the only time I think I’ve seen Kate break a bit and show emotion through her total immersion in a role. And with good reason. Can’t wait to see where her comedy takes her from here.
My favorite sketch
This is gold. Thanks Kate. 👊🏽
I don't know how SNL can ever top this! Kate is absolutely hysterical and I will truly miss her skits. This one was literally out of this world! 🤣👏🏼🤣👏🏼🤣
so long Kate
Oh those damn onion fairies!
Kate , YOU ARE CLASSIC !!!!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏🎉🤣💥❤ Thanks for the wondrous laughs 😘
That was the funniest skit I've seen in a while! 🤣🤣🤣
I love the "encounter" sketches :D Please do more of them!
At least Natasha showed up for rehearsal.  Most of the hosts do nothing but stare at the teleprompter through the whole bit.
❤️❤️❤️
If you were doing nominations for the Mount Rushmore of SNL, then Kate McKinnon would not be a bad choice at all. Many have become bigger stars.... Rock, Sandler, etc.... but very few have  contributed more to the show. She's right on par with Wiig in my opinion. She is a comedic master and was involved in the majority of the best sketches over the last decade. One of the very few comedians who can make you laugh with their facial expressions alone.
🥲 Man, I knew this would be Kyle's and Aidy's last season but Kate's and Pete's farwells took me completely by surprise... 👏🏼Well done guys and wishing best of luck to all!
Y'all Kate's Hillary Clinton impression c. 2015 got me watching SNL in college, I legit started tearing up at the end when she did. The end of an era. We love you Kate <3
The title of this hurts. She has to come back to host and do this again one day
Absolutely gutted to say goodbye to her.
I'm going to miss her on SNL.
Why clean the house if nobody's coming over🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
A hipster's beard stuffed into a N95 mask.
There isn't one sketch that failed to make me laugh with Kate in it. She was the SNL for me! Can't believe there won't be more of her here. SNL won't be the same without you, love you SO MUCH Kate! Thanks for cracking me up all these years & being an inspiration!
I'm gonna miss u Kate thank u for the big laughs!!!enjoy ur New endeavors!!!one of the top ten cast members of all time.BYEEEEEEE!!!
The NSA is not in the Pentagon. I keep saying SNL, let me help you get the details right.
Aidy was so emotional the whole time💕💕💕💕💕
This their way of writing her out? :(  DON'T GO KATE!!!! <3
She’s one of the best talents on that show truly gonna be missed and a hard pair of shoes to fill 🙌🏼
Fans of SNL all  know she will be impossible to replace. I have loved the cast this decade; but Kate has been the super glue. At the same time, her career is about to take off,  we will be seeing a lot more of her.
The Kermit the frog arms and the alien noises 😂 oh Kate we love you
My dong hole, and my wrong hole. Lol!!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Kate McKinnon is a legend 👏 🙌  I LOVE YOU Kate!!!!!
For anyone saying SNL will never be the same, it isn't meant to be. What makes SNL unique is that it's a generational series. Think of it as college: you grind, do you time, and some graduate with honors, some dropout, and some get expelled. Some of the most cherished memories of your life will be experienced here, but with all things in life, cultures and norms change like seasons, as so does comedy. Can't stay in college forever––gotta move on, pass the baton, and let the new class have a shot and carry on the SNL traditions.
I won't miss seeing Kate smoke.
Why am I crying in the club rn
I guess the audience  was told before the show. She was leaving.
Yawn. All lead up without a punchline.
Had me on the verge of crying at the end there, gonna miss her work so much. She better have a solid gig set up soon we need more Kate!
Awwww 🥲 I love her!!
KATE EFFIN MCKINNON!!!!!  I WAS CRYING TOO!   THANK YOU!
I don't want her to leave. The show won't be the same without her 😟
My dong hole and my wrong hole . . . 🤣🤣🤣🤣   Goodbye Ms Rafferty.  ☹️
You can see her emotion…priceless and amazing!  Godspeed Kate!
😂 Kate is fkn funny.
Kate Mckinnon's acting is Amazing. 💯
Thank you Kate, not only for your comedic talent, but for standing strong during the Trump regime. Your “Hallelujah” said it all.
i'm going to miss all of them but especially kate. i hope they get everything they hope for.
Ryan Gosling is sitting somewhere calling his agent wondering why he wasn't offered the guest spot for Kate's farewell.
Great send off.
It's time to meet our family in the stars
Noooo!!!! Don't tell me my goddess KM is leaving us. As if 2022 could get any worse 😫
Kate McKinnon’s back must hurt so bad from carrying SNL for years
Entertaining? Sure. Funny? Meh 🫤.
I just love her so much. Don't dissappear forever now ♥️
No Trump caricature this week!Bummer!
"Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened."  ~Dr. Seuss
Certified hood classic
Someone on SNL watched agents of shield! lol
good
This skit is funny, but doesn’t even come close to the original.
Omg i am crying from laughing so hard. Love you KATE!
5:24 I wonder if Kate realized that you can't make a "P" sound with a cigarette in your mouth or if it was intentional 😂
Crying. This skit is classic. Kate will be so missed and I hope she knows how loved she is. Her timing, delivery, commitment to her characters has brought such a richness to SNL. I miss her already!
I just love her she the best
LOVE YA GIRL!
THIS is the best series of sketches in YEARS.
Love it!  Love her!  Thank you!!!!!!!!!
Wait… is Kate leaving too? 😭
Maybe the greatest recurring sketch of this generation. I hope it gets turned into a movie someday. Thanks Kate for all the laughs!
So sad that she's leaving she always made me laugh unlike Pete Davidson, glad he's gone.
Finally!!! Get rid of the one who plays all the talkshow hosts next! And then the fat one
McKinnon’s been a key part of the show for a decade and deservedly won two Best Supporting acting Emmys for it (the only cast member to do so).
“Why clean the house if nobody’s coming over”   😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
6:51 We love you too, Kate.
"Why clean the house when no one's coming over?" I laughed real hard at that. So sad to see Kate go tho.
Epic 😀😃😄😁😆🤣😂
legend
🥺🥹
That was...strangely befitting. Kate McKinnon was an entity unto herself more than any other person ever on television. I get the bad feeling SNL is making a move to try to make the cast more of a "team" unit in a redux of the original "Not Ready For Primetime Players." Any success they would have with that would only mean a broadcast network achieving success at synthesizing the appearance of organic origins, further distancing us people from our primal sense of community. Anything associated with General Electric is going to eventually instill a fiat sense of values. Because it breaks people to make profit.
i didnt expect to cry when i started this video lol
The most naturally funny woman they've ever had one the show...and yes even above Gilda.
thank you kate for putting a smile on our faces every time we saw you we love you.
WOW i always cracked up at the alien abduction shit they did, SNL sent her off in that dam ship wit the lil grey men lolol classic goodbye
I feel like she ad libs half of this stuff lol
Gonna miss Emmy award winner Kate McKinnon. Hope she has a great success and wins more awards.
This is my favorite sketch on SNL. Every installment is hilarious.
It didn't hit me till the end that she was leaving the show. This was a great way to illustrate her departure. She's one of the greats.
😂😂😂 I love Kate so much 💗
So awsome! 👌
This was beautiful
McKinnon is not funny. Simple fact. SHE thinks she's funny though.
I wonder if Kate's line was meant to say "Hermit the Crab" instead of Kermit the Frog?
omg, she's leaving? awwe crap
This was great! Hope Kate does more movies and TV in the future, she was the best one on the cast
💖
Yes ! I swear Kate is on my top 3 lol
Thank you Kate McKinnon, I respect all your work at impersonating so many different characters over the years. Good luck in future endeavors 👏🏽🙌🏽
This was by far Kate's best SNL skit. She definitely left on a high note
For me Kate's comedy routines took me back to the early SNL days with the cast like Gilda Radner, Jane Curtain and Laraine Newman.  Kate is a standout comedian that will leave a huge hole to fill on SNL.
Aw I love that this is the sketch they brought back to send her off on.  The original is such a classic.  Definitely a great cast member that will be missed.
I could really feel her emotion at the end there, had me almost in tears it was like the end of an era 😢
My favorite skit! Long live Colleen!
I teared up the second I realized what this sketch truly reveals
"the umpire called time out" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Kate needs her very own show. She is pure genius.
Combined, all cast members leaving almost total Keenan's total years on the show.      leave
Noooo! Ok, but give me a KM sketch show.
Good riddance Aidy!
So that was Kate's final performance of this skit as a regular cast member and she's leaving. DAMN! Im SO NOT READY for her to go! Her comedy (especially playing all these crazy politicians) has kept me sane these last 10 years and 2 election cycles. Sad to see her leave SNL! I'm gonna miss her so much! It's not gonna be the same without her!
Dong Hole and my Wrong Hole. Legendary.
Kate is the most legendary comedian at SNL in this century
Repeat attempt at an unfunny script.
Good Luck, Kate!
omg i got tears.... wishing you all the best kate <3
"are you gays seeing this??" MD: 😣😟😬🥺😝
Thanks for the memories, Kate.  You made us laugh and sometimes cry.  One of the greats.
Omg! I can't believe Kate is leaving. 😔 She's so dam amazing and had my LMFAO! Aidy too. WOW! 4 leaving at once. Idk. I hope it will still be hilarious with the other cast. They'll be missed and I'm sure, they'll comeback for cameos. Wishing them ALL the best. ❤️
I adore Natasha so much but mama a southern accent is just not for you 😂
This was a beautiful send off for the sketch, a remarkable character, an all time outstanding cast member.
To me the funniest skit that Kate played Was when she was Ruth Bader Ginsberg talking to Colin and she was dancing. Kate got the moves!
Shows has not been funny for 25 years!!
NBC needs to fire more of these woke losers!
oh my gosh i cried at the end!  I'll miss you Kate!!!!!
I DIDN'T REALIZE SHE WAS LEAVING😭😭😭
I didn’t think I was gonna cry, but that exit made me SOB
And I’m crying 🥹 she really kept an entire nation sane through so much 💕💕😭
Why clean the house if nobody’s coming over… Respect! ✌️
Oh, nice😆
Kate is the best! I have always been amazed at how she is able to play so many different people in the sketches. It will be really difficult to replace her talent. I wish her the best! ❤️
Tears of laughter every time I watch ‘part one’, this part is equally as great, if not better!  Kate McKinnon is a comedic genius and will be missed on SNL…what a great send off!
Cannot wait to see what is next 💙💛💙💛
Oh say it ain’t so!!!
Ms McKinnon, you'll be greatly missed
I can't wait to show this to my dad, this is his favorite Kate McKinnon character. Him laughing brings me so much joy.
They Only Keep The Best & Brightest
Thank you for all these years Kate !
Miss ya Kate!
😭❤
Pete Kate who’s next? Keenan?
Fuck. That was the saddest "Live from New York, it's Saturday Night" I've ever seen. Now I'm bawling half nekkid in hotel bathroom, and I feel Kate would be cool with that.
I thought they were maga supporters.
2 SNL send offs in 1 show ? 😭😭😭😭
Was that an agents of shield reference at the start?
What's a n95???
STOP i’m actually so sad rn
She is the best all us fan's will miss her nsl is never going to be the same but she will be back some time soon as a guest are maybe back permanently seeing her cry made me have tears in my eyes
Guy next to Aidy is cute
Omg I hope this is good. Fn love these sketches.
I miss her already 🤣❤️🖖
kate is one of the best cast member of all time
“Why clean the house when no one’s coming over” lol that’s my motto 😂😂😂😂😅🤣
Crying 😭
not a single joke wasnt a vagina joke. its literally the only thing women can make jokes about.
Yes, yes, I'm crying. We love Kate, and what a fun sketch for her send off! A classic! LOL!!
🥺👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Best in cast right now - she will be missed. Thank you for all the laughs
Kate McKinnon, Wow!
I’m not crying… you’re crying…
In what world is a single second of this funny?
The perfect send-off for Kate.
This is one of my favorite skits ever by SNL. Love you Kate!!!
I love that Aidy had to stand there and wait for the RAPTUROUS applause to quiet down as soon as people recognized the sketch set
'My dong hole and my wrong hole' 😂😂😂
Greatest cold open of SNL ever...and what the hell, Kate is REALLY leaving? I pride myself in staying out of touch, so this comes as a pure-D shock!
"No obviously not"
My dong hole & my wrong hole 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Kate girl!!! Gonna miss you!
SNL won’t be the same without Kate
How did they do this without laughing 😂😂
Gonna miss kate
Kate you are an absolute legend and have brought so many amazingly funny moments onto the show for so many years.  Really touching at the end to see how much the show meant to you, you will certainly be missed and leave some extremely hard shoes to fill.
Really well done if you ask me. One of the best cast members ever in one of her/the shows funniest sketches ever for a hilarious sendoff that she was able to make sincere and heartfelt right at the end. I hope Kate does great things going forward.
This is not good.we have to bring her back.she owns the SNL.sometimes we need to change the reality.
Kate you made me laugh thousands of times and will be missed.  Pete I can't see how your leaving isn't an upgrade to the show
No piano piece... KATE...?
Who?haven't watched this in over 40 years.the last episode I watched was Eddie Murphy doing a stupid skit of James Brown in a hot tub.i saw then,this show has went the way of braindead stupid.
Immaculate ending to her trip.  I can't wait to see what is next.  👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
"The dong hole and the wrong hole"!?!?! 🤣🤣😂🤣
She’d make a great Hillary, a behind bars special!
I went from hysterically laughing to straight up cryin’ She had brought me so much joy!!! I will miss you Kate!!!
If she doesn't make a movie of this it will be an incredible travesty
Someone started chopping onions at my house while I was watching the ending.  SNIFF.
Kate is the greatest female performer in the history of SNL
I came to laugh, left sobbing lol.
This was hard…. That’s what she said.
Epic, well-deserved sendoff
Dong hole and Wrong hole HAHAHAHAHA
Damn… I just can’t stand the thought of SNL without her. Though I’m sure she’ll make some guest appearances.
Kate is a legend!
I'm just so sad about all the goodbyes..... they were like friends
I must’ve missed it, this was Kate’s last SNL show as a cast member?
You could see that Kate McKinnon was crying at the end. McKinnon is this generations "Lucille Ball".
Damnit... some ASSHOLE came into my house and started cutting onions.
Now she can come back and host.
Let's Go Brandon ! 💩💣
no. terrible, tired, and old.  a waist of tape.
Noone can ever tke her place
Were those other two women explaining the *Time Knife* basically? Lol  Anyway, when KM first joined SNL she stood out, and you just knew that she was gonna be a big deal. Can't believe she's leaving. Thanks for all the laughs Kate 🙂
This was great.
That was amazing. So funny!
Kate is snl. It's nothing without her.
KATE MCKINNON NOOOO😭😭😭😭 we love you! And Ms. Rafferty😭😭
The minute she stepped on the spaceship ramp is when I realized she is leaving the show. It won't be the same. She does too many characters too well. Hope she does lots of cameos in the years to come.
"I always kinda felt like an alien on this planet anyway."  Honestly that'd be my logic for going with extraterrestrials to space and leaving Earth forever.
"Now, this really rips my nips"!😭 Colleen/Kate, in your honor, I'm heading over to my ex-husband's, to "UPPER DECK" that deadbeat's 🚽". I had no idea this was your exit! Tell those funny gray aliens (with the big dumb eyes), Krinklemouse, Shart, Toby, Curious Georgina, and the hairy butt-rubbin' Monkey People that you WILL be rescued. Keep an eye out, for menopausal women, sporting "NO FEAR T-shirts and ankle socks." We'll be storming the spaceship, "like shoppers at a Walmart,on Black Friday." You've made us laugh for YEARS. Now, we're in tears...definitely feel like we're on the "wrong side of the portal". Miss you, already!
I am going to miss her!! She is so good!!!
Okay but why did this actually make me cry though!! (...probably because Kate has been one of the best and I'm gonna miss tf outta her.)
What an exit
She’s leaving!?!?! Omg!!!
Kate McKinnon is one of the most talented people to ever grace SNL .  Can't wait to see what she does in the future .  Thanks for the laughs Kate !
I'm so sad. She is the BEST!
Wait, thats the best friend from american pie?! holy plastic surgery!
Like my bush was the last lifeboat on the Titanic...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sucks that Kate, Kyle and Aidy are leaving, they're a big part of awesomeness. Pete on the other hand can't leave fast enough for me.
Kate McKinnon is a living legend of comedy. She’s our new Gilda Radner, (for those born after 1980, she was one of the funniest, bravest and best of the original cast).
Kate rocks🔥
Oh mylanta😢 off to the stars, Kate!
She’s one of the few that I liked.
Whoever writes theses sketches knows  channeled materials.
Love you Kate and will miss you 😘
What!? Kate AND Pete are leaving??  I am absolutely devastated!!!
YES YES YES thank god, this is one of the best ever
Aidy looked like she was holding back tears the entire time. 🥺 what a touching skit this turned out to be.
Superstar, Kate McKinnon! Happy trails.
Hilarious
There will never be another like Kate McKinnon. 🐐
I know he hasn't handled everyone leaving with grace in the past.. but Lorne really showed some class and love by giving all 4 of them the send off they deserved. Good luck to all of them, I'm sure none of them will need it, but either way, can't wait to see what they accomplish!
KATE we will miss you. 😢 ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love her so much!!! Gonna miss you! 💜
That is the way to go. TV history moment.
Greatest UFO abductee ever. Best wishes wherever they rope ladder drop her off at.
Miss Rafferty is just too good for us on Earth. Thank you, Kate, we love you!
"Why clean the house if no one is coming over." Jesus!! 🤣🤣🤣
Missed this last night. Watched just now, oblivious... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
So Sad…… damn!
"...I always kinda felt like an alien on this planet anyway." 💗Kate McKinnon💓
Legendary send off...Was that the only skit she did the whole night? She needs a great agent to transition her to movies now
I’d be like ‘Duces bitches’😂❤️
🤣😭
The send-off at the end got me in the feels.
would be cool fi they did more cold opens that are actual comedy sketches vs. lame political impressions
I love her so much!!! Gonna miss her!
Kate is killing it. I liked the hipster shot.
Another one is leaving? Ugh!
It would be funny to have her comeback at some point for a checkin guest appearance
But I also don’t understand why women women do things that are completely gross it’s considered funny. But when men do things that are completely gross were told to grow up. Even if we’re acting.
Not funny
Hall of fame SNL player. She will be missed. Salute🫡
This could be their last performance. I hope I will see that movie legend whom Kate played once again.
Best send off ever !!
Devastated Kate is leaving :(
Damn. I’m gonna miss her so much. Her and Pete. Both my favorites.
One of my favorite SNL skits with all great performers, ALL of them, no doubt. Kate McKinnon emotional “And live from NY…” wet my eyes, so touching. Thank you Kate and Aidy, hard to let you go from this audience member. Cecily, Mikey, keep going strong; and Natasha, we love your Russian Doll 🪆
Going to really, really miss you, Kate!
Did not expect that one to end in tears! Love Kate and Aidy!  And the rest of them!  Natasha ❤️😉
One of the funniest people who has ever graced my television screen. Best of luck in the future, Kate! We expect great things from you.
She’ll set the record for fastest to the five timers club and it’ll be awesome
You people are really giving a lot of credit to someone who doesn’t deserve it that much. Yes Kate was a great Elizabeth Warren. Outside of that? I could never stand to see her on screen. Cecily Strong on the other hand is remarkable and is totally under used. Same goes for that white chick that gets really loud and has the big mouth I can’t remember her name
End of an era❤️
Lol
Shes the best Snl has ever had (yes I said it!) and I've seen all the seasons. I highly suggest watching the snl at home cat skit.. has me laughing with tears everytime 🤣....
I will miss Kate and Aidy! They are gifted actresses who have never failed to make me laugh.....a lot! This skit was hilarious!
You will be missed, Thank you for all the laughs.
OMFG....the character that made me laugh hardest is making me cry ugly tears.
I love a story with a happy ending. Good luck out there Mrs Rafferty.  And good luck to you as well Kate. Thank you for the laughs.
Omg. That was well written & delivered by Kate M & gang Kate you played such a convincing role!  watch out the q-anons will believe this!
😭😭😭
Kate is the best
Kate is a legend.
Good God NOOOOOOOO 🥺
Great send-off for a great performer. Thank You Kate for the gift of laughter. I wish you all the best.
Kate McKinnon is an SNL legend and this was the best sketch of the night!! Best of luck in your future, after this opening skit,the show went down faster than  Bill Clinton's pants at the  Playboy mansion, one of the worst season finales in the history of SNL
I kind of thought it was her last days last week when she was princess number three and they did that close up. I even thought if this is her last sketch it would be well done. But this was masterful. I cant wait to see what Kate does next and of course, when she comes back to host someday.
When she said "Grabbing and plucking," I heard something completely different, 😆
Why clean the house when nobody is coming over 😂😂😂
Pete Davidson is leaving, and then I see this video... _FINAL_ Encounter. What a terrible day
I wish they would have done a final Dr. Weknowdis on WU
I might be done with SNL then
I didn't know she was definitely leaving! THIS IS AWFUL NEWS!! I HOPE MICHAEL CHE RECONSIDERED!
This is the end of an era. Such a great talent, I cant wait to see what she will do next.
why clean the house if no ones coming over....just perfect.
Love you Kate!!!!
An end of an era and a true loss for SNL. Kate McKinnon is one of the all-time best.
For me, "Hipster's beard in an N95 mask" might just replace, "Smuggling an Ewok out of Mexico."
I’ll never look at a man’s bushy beard stuffed in a face mask again.
Did she just do a "good bye" sketch?  Tf Kate? You can't leave!  You're too important and valuable!  I'm really gonna miss your dong-hole and your wrong-hole! Thank for the years of laughter!  Can't wait to see what you do next!
Love Kate. She will be missed in SNL
Legendary sketch
wait kate's leaving???? this has me tearing up i had no idea
Each time I watch this it gets funnier & funnier... 😍
There's been alot of pent up anger brewing in Washington lately.  The staff in the Subway thats located on its premises, aparently don't know how to make a cup of coffee.   General Mark A. Milley was outraged when (as he described) "got a cup of hot hot milk" with his sandwich. The employee was stripped of her position, sacked, and mailed to guantanamo.  Inside sources say, she's now living and working from squalid conditions inside a 8 by 10 Footlong cell, where she sweats & slaves for crumbs preparing food.  (No change there then😏)
😭😭😭😭😭 she's so good and this was the best goodbye
I can’t remember the last time I laughed until tears flowed & it didn’t have anything to do with politics! Thanks!💖👏
🤔🤔🤔 WONDER WEAR... 😝😝😝
Damn I was reading the comments and thought these soft asses talking about tearing up at the end. Then I did too. This sketch was a fav. Her references to her private parts alone are quotable and notable. She will be a loss to this show. SNL legend
You got me crying there, Kate.  Kyle, Kate, and Aidy were the reason I started watching SNL. I wish I had not been familiar with them in the first place.SNL won't be the same for me. Such an excruciating pain.
The CIA is not in the Pentagon
1 min in to this skit, was rolling on the bed w/ laughter... 😃 😀 😄  6 mins into this skit, was posting this is hilariously hilarious... Smh... THE CLAW & PUBIC HAIRS... LIKE WHAT ??? TOO FUNNY !!!
F’kn hilarious Kate!
Wow another SNL Legend we love u Kate
×++334
I didn't follow SNL for a while and Kate McKinnon is the sole reason I got back into it some years ago. There are and have been many greats obviously but she is an absolute legend.
Is this Kate's last season as well? Damn, she will be missed a lot. They need to bring Natasha on the cast for the next season, at least for a year. That would have been awesome.
I hope that for the love of god they bring back Kate and Pete occasionally as guests. I felt shattered seeing their goodbyes. Definitely made me tear up. I have grown up with them, they were my generations greats on snl 🥲🥹
Wait.  huh?  :  (
After this she’ll be staring in a recreation of tiger king. Oh how the mighty have fallen.
She got choked up at the end. Is she leaving the Show?? 🤷‍♀️ Brilliant sketch, she's so funny! 👽🛸
Dong hole and my wrong hole 🤣
Hey! I was born on the greatest planet ever!  Now live in a sh*t hole!  Didn't move!  Similar story!
Sorry but Natasha ruined it for me...Kate deserved Ryan or Paul or Leiv or Casey or all of them for her final encounter...missed opportunity
Wow!  Kate, YOU ROCK!  And for all the folks leaving, thanks so much for the laughs in a world gone sadly wrong.
Gonna miss her. Always enjoyed her acting.  Wish her the best 👌
If she would have done the "Nixon Wave" at the end, I would have lost my shit.
Dong hole and wrong hole lol lol
Nooooooo!!!  You can't go!
Wait Kate AND Pete are leaving SNL????? IS THE ENTIRETY OF SNL OVER?????????????????????
For once they tell the truth of human bodies and alien's higher understanding of 愛, that's love in Chinese, and id est pronounced in "ai" — artificial intelligence
Once a great joke, it is wearing thin.
Aww, man. I’m going to miss her so much 🥲
I haven’t seen the rest of the show but. Saying goodbye to this character and her reaction at the end tells me this is her last season.
Kate McKinnon is THE BEST.
Oh c'mon. Say it ain't so.
Irreplaceable
Better than last week.  ......So is a chlorox enema!
That looks nasty
I'll never forget seeing her in her first few sketches in 2012, specifically the Cecilia Jimenez weekend update cameo and I thought "she's gonna be the next major star this show produces, just wait" and sure enough.
They're all good but Ms. Kate, priceless.....she'll have a long career in movies and TV..you go, girl. Cecily Strong is also really good....great job...she was a little verklempt there at the end... ; - )
as soon as she turned around i cried
Kate, Aidy, Kyle and Pete will be missed on SNL. All have very promising futures like many other past SNL talents.
Clever exit to a brilliant and hilarious SNL run!
Bless your heart
She's amazing! What a great send-off. Best of luck to her ❤
Right when she turned around to look from the door, i started tearing because I will not only miss her but also Aidy, Pete, and Kyle.
“What the hell, play the hits, right?”  Pretty much sums up SNL writing anymore. The sketch was funny the first time. Let it die.
Dang. The show will be much less without her.
What a great ending to her run. Even that last line in the room—“I always felt kinda like an alien on this planet anyway”—has a tone of bittersweetness. A lot of people turn to comedy because they feel out of place in the world, but Kate McKinnon found where she belonged, and she inspired lots of other people who feel the same way. Thank you for the laughter, Ms. McKinnon. :)
She's been the best addition to this show
“Special Agent Fitzsimmons” I see someone in the writers room is an Agents of SHIELD fan …
Nooooo😭
Oh no! I am going to miss her on SNL!
😭😢😥😢😭 sad now kate was my all time SNL FAVORITE
Best farewell ever
Everyone's talking about being moved because Kate's leaving-  I'm just psyched we finally got to see the gray aliens with the stupid eyes!
I’m sorta kinda crying 😭 both from laughing and knowing that she’s leaving. But I am looking forward to her coming back to host the show once in a while!
Aidy is leaving too, right?
“Why clean the house when no one’s coming over” 😂🤣😂😭😭😭
Why clean the house when nobody’s coming over OMG how much of this comic brilliance was ad libbed!!!
I cried 😭
Why would the NSA care about alien abductions? That's USAF business.
OH WOW *It's not just Kate that is leaving. Aidy, Kyle Mooney and Pete Davidson have ALL left.* I was already sad enough about Kate, but baby Aidy too?? Kyle is so funny. I even love Pete lol. Kate was my favorite, but I also really loved Aidy. This show will not be the same without them. I wish they wouldn't leave.
We love you, Kate! All the best are moving on, Ellen, Kate… 😞
by far one of my favorite snl cast members. show won’t be the same without her and i hate knowing we wont see her on again :(
"My dong hole and my wrong hole." I laughed way too hard after she said that. Haha! This show is definitely not going to be the same without her.
Why do I get mad at Lorne whenever a cast member leaves.  She was one of the best cast members ever.
Why clean the house when nobody is coming over. That was well delivered
The umpire called time out! Legend. Going to miss you Kate. Can't wait to see your next act. And Colleen you are among the stars!
Kate will be missed.
Someday woman might actually be funny without doing gross-out lady parts humor or stereotypical female characters. But don't hold your breath.
Kate McKinnon is the GOAT
Haven't watched snl in forever, but saw this on my feed and absolutely had to click
Gotta’ say Kate McKinnon’s version The Aristocrats is tops!
Oh man it’s sad day for me !!!!
nuuu I didn't know she was leaving. She is quite literally the funniest cast member, and I don't even want to watch with her gone. I am so glad they chose to do one of these Close Encounters as her send off though. My favorite <3 I will miss you Kate! I better see you in everything else that I watch, or I am going to be one sad human being.
"dong hole and my wrong hole" 😂😂😂🔥🔥
Waaaaaaaaah. Kate McKinnon you crazy comic genius! We will MISS YOU! xx
Losing her and Pete on the show in the same year hurts but SNL has a long tradition of bringing on great comedians.
LOVE YOU KATE !
What an adventure
After the Ghostbusters reboot (controversial, I know, but I thought it was hilarious), the Times said that Kate McKinnon should be in every movie ever made from then on. I agree. Fabulously talented and smart.
I’ll be excited to see Kate and Aidy come back to host next season.
I love how they shoot this… with the two of them in one frame and Kate in the frame by herself 😂😂😂😂😂 makes it even more hilarious
She managed to hold it together.
Just love Kate from the beginning. I am gonna miss her so much. However I know she's ready for more success in shows and movies. She will also be hosting soon enough. Good luck Kate!
Lol, wish they'd gone with the actual number of times Rafferty and "Strong" have been abducted. Seven, not three.
She’s a powerhouse! Her closure gave some bitterness to the rest of the show. I hope she gets a future as bright as Will Ferrel. Will be missed.
That was an interesting choice for a fairwell cold opening! Loved it!
Thanks for letting me stay awhile. 😭😢
such a bummer....shes great
No wayyyy I can’t believe she is leaving 😭😭one of the best that has come from this show
SNL will never be the same.
She is absolutely a legend - I have watched four decades of SNL and Kate McKinnon has been my absolute favorite comic - hands down. She expanded what was possible for a female comedian to do taking on male and female roles alike.  She is a comic genius and I wish her all the very best. Will miss her tremendously. Hopefully she will come back and be a repeat host.
We will miss you Kate! Such a great actress and comedian. The show won’t be the same without you.
One of my favorite cold openings. Kate was brilliant on this show. A diamond. I'm so excited for her future endeavors!
One of the most talented members, ever. Legend.
The audience is so loud in this... so distracting.. kills it for me 😢😢
My positively favorite Kate sketch!!!!!
Never to see SHUD the mermaid again,, so sad. Kate is great.
She sucks!
Earth loves Kate, too! Best of luck up there ❤️
Her mind, at the end…I could feel her thoughts of that present moment.  It WAS a stellar moment, in her life.  I appreciate her life force and ability to create. May she now WalkINbeauty.
AH GONNA MISS YOU   KATE  McKINNON     MANY TIMES BEING IN PAIN FROM CANCER YOU LAUGHED ME THROUGH  GIRL  YOUR WELLED LOVED.. HUGS AND KISSES OXOX
Man I have wet eyes. I hope I will continue loving and enjoying SNL with Kate missing! I will terribly  miss Kate and the other talents that said goodbye!
All the Democrats are bailing ship before the midterms... weird.
Oh some more reality sucking the joy out of my life. You were a joy from the first moment. We will miss you.
Poor Natasha keeps between switching between a Southern accent and New York accent.
awww man.
My all time favorite … she’s so versatile  I hope she comes back to guest star often  🥲
The vag jokes were off the chain!
Awwww. Goodbye! Loved ya at first sight on SNL  Miss Kate!
Something really funny from SNL, at long last.
She will be missed 😢💔
Didn't think a snl cold open would get me crying
Unfortunate send-off Kate will certainly be missed.  They should have had the aliens (bat a knocker)   best wishes Kate.
Was not expecting to tear up at the end of a Ms. Rafferty sketch. Thank you for all the laughs, Kate!
Outstanding!!!!!
Kate McKinnon is one of the modern legends of SNL. She, like Kenan, somehow managed to keep even the worst skits funny
Oh man. I'm so sad
I'm sonsad Kate and Aidy are leaving.
I will miss her so much
Omg, I'm going to miss Kate so much.  That actually got me teary eyed at the end.
Utter brilliance. Wow at the comedic legends that pass through SNL....
If you’re going to go out might as well go out with a bang.
It's amazing how funny this show can be when they're not too busy being political or looking for an excuse to cram not funny cast members in every sketch. This sketch is pure genius and the writing is incredible.
Idea for continuation;   They like her,BUT.... drop her back off... 😆
thanks for being here for a while
I hope she has nothing but the best of all luck and fortune going forward, she’s been a solid foundation of SNL and key reason I’ve watched for quite some time now. Emotional ending to the skit and a well deserved exit for the character as well.
That is what I call a sendoff.  What a sketch! ""They're grabbing and plucking, climbing all over each other like my bush is the last lifeboat on the Titanic."
A subtle and beautiful ending.
Another star leaving. Also to be so sadly missed. You think by now we would be use to this. I understand and wish her so much continued success and happiness!! I will be watching for you Kate and Pete. God Bless you both! Thanks for all the laughter and tears!!
Gonna miss Kate sooo much. IMO the best cast member to ever grace the stage at studio 8H. Looking forward to all her future endeavors!
wait, she's leaving???????? nooooooooooooo
WE LOVE YOU KATE!!!
Time to end this one!   A classic embarrassment!   Worst SNL ever!
Bye Kate ❤️👽👽
The Best Kate
literally sobbing 😭 ❤
😢😢😢😢😢
Damn Kate and Pete at the same time smh
Television sure has changed since I was young. A sketch like that would have gotten the studio bombed and dozens of people imprisoned. I like it better this way. Besides, it's funny!
When she comes back to host she can def return with the aliens… hopefully with an alien family and tales of her interspacial adventures
No, I just have something in my eye 😭
We're going to miss you Kate!  Wish you much luck and happiness!
It's a jungle down there! 🤣
It’s an understatement to say they’ve had a lot of talent on that show, but I think she might’ve been the best
Wait I thought Kate already left years ago
Happy trails.
Even though SNL became a wokeness hellscape at times.. Kate was always able to get the most out of the material and deliver laughs, sometimes the only ones on the show. Her talent will be missed
Kate McKinnon was the best!🏆🎬
I don’t say this lightly … I’m in fucking tears 😭 she had me rollin   Kate is a comedic genius and a true treasure
Way to go SNL. Take a classic, hilarious original skirt and then beat-the-shit out of it. This is why you're losing your audience.
7:27 you can almost smell the standing ovation can’t you??? 👏🏾 So long Kate!
"....why clean the house if no body's coming over"  Brilliant!!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Best of luck to Kate, an SNL legend
Love ya km
Started crying after seeing Kate say her final farewell 😢 you can tell her energy is so pure. She was one of the best parts of the show. Kate you will be missed ❤
Aidy Bryant and Kate McKinnon are up there with Maya Rudolph, Cheri Oteri, Molly Shannon, Amy Poehler and Kristen Wiig. They have made me laugh so much over the years that I cried seeing them leave. Super-Stars.
You can hear her voice crack as she says the last "Live from New York it's Saturday Night" of her decade-long career.
I will miss Kate McKinnon. She absolutely needs her own show. She's the best. Always, always makes me laugh.
Why am I crying?  Definitely gonna miss Kate here. Can't wait to see what she does next!
The middle one was an npc
I don't know what was funnier, "That fortune-teller was spot-on" or "The umpire called a time-out." 😂
That was definitely emotional, even when we weren’t expecting it to be.  I will miss her and the others who are leaving.  I’ve never enjoyed SNL so much as I have these past 10 years with Kate on the show.
gonna miss her, i cant wait to see what she does next
I only got into SNL this year, haven't been watching long but even I know Kate was a vital member of this crew. And she will truly be missed, the show must go on but no one can ever truly take her place❤
⭐⭐⭐⭐ ⭐🎶And She did it, Herrrrrr waaaaaaaaay🎶🎶
My dong hole and my wrong hole 🤣🤣🤣
A great loss.
This was a hard one for me. My gawd I’m going to miss this woman! Epic send off. Be well, Kate! Godspeed.
Kate McKinnon is already legend. I will miss her so much. Maybe someday she will even return to host SNL. I will also miss Aidy Bryant, Kyle Mooney and Pete as well. All of your futures are bright. Onward and upward. ❤️
Don't know how the next group will get to be as good as the departing crew....Kyle is funny, Aidy is hilarous, and Kate is....Kate! Unique, endlessly versatile, and comic genius.
“I got more hair than a hipster’s beard in an N95!!”…OMG!! Kate is the best!! Gonna miss her and Aidy!!  Edit: Hadn’t finished when I posted. First cold open that made me cry! Gonna miss Kate on SNL!! She really carried the show!
Think MGT, Boebert  and Niki Haley
There was life on SNL before Kate and there will be life on SNL after Kate.  But, flipping heck, we will miss one of the all time greats! The pleasure has been all ours, Miss McKinnon! ❤️
We should have had 4 years of Kate McKinnon doing Hillary. Darn it trump cultists, another thing you ruined.
Are they fired or have other projects?  Because the new young pups , I'm getting too old for what isn't funny. Like Saraaaah
Hundreds of years from now, when there's no one left alive who viewed the spectacle that was Kate, this shall still be remembered as the best SNL sendoff of ALL TIME.
Going to miss those leaving but best of luck. BRAVO
What a send off.
I haven't found SNL funny in a long time. Maybe I have the minority opinion but Kate and Pete have never been funny to me.
Absolutely loved growing up watching her I'm so glad she was casted
She has stayed on years beyond her initial contract… I think she knows she’s beloved 😭
I'm actually sobbing
Kate was the best of this bunch. I'll miss Kate, Pete, Aidy, not so much Kyle. I didn't think he was that funny.
Its time for SNL to shut it down. Hasnt been good in 20 yrs
Good lord she was actually crying at the end  😢  SNL legend carved in stone, all the best Kate and thank you for your service 🫡
She was the best loved her deeply. Miss you Kate.
Kate the G.O.A.T. an all-time fav.
Kate no 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
aidy having flashbacks from the start
So sad to see her leaving SNL, but also excited to see what's she's got up her sleeve next. 😊
The best part of this is how at this point no one gives a hoot what anyone says but Kate
…and they were grabbin and Fukin and grabbin and fukin…🤣🤣🤣 Bye Kate!
I absolutely love the comedy of that there lady pal Kate McKinnon she cracks me the F up I love it.
Natasha speaks hillbilly with a Brooklyn accent.   Gonna miss you guys, ain't lyin'.
We’ll miss you Kate!!!
She'll be back hosting at some point, I'm sure
Kate is an SNL legend. One of the greats!
You can feel the heat radiating from it 😅
Kate was the reason I even started watching SNL. Before her, it was unbearable to me but with her, along with Cecily it actually became funny and enjoyable. She will be missed.
Gonna miss ya Kate! You're the best!
Legend, we are gonna miss ya Kate
Kate introduced me to Leonard Cohen the Saturday night after his death and the most devastating week for those of us that recognized our country may never be the same because we had elected to president the most despicable man to have walked this land. But Kate lifted us up with her rendition of Hallelujah and I cried uncontrollably where in the moment i knew that nothing would be the same again but i had discovered the music from a man that has helped me deal with life the last 6 years.
Lorne Michaels is out of his mind. It was way too soon to send her off.
The hipster comment had me wheezing!!
Bravo, she feels like the last of a dying breed of SNL legends
I'm so grateful for her career at SNL, she gave us some of the best skits of all time, like this one, the awkward teenager having a date and calling his friend Jason... so many years. I am really going to miss her
Why is she leaving??
This skit was THE best thing I have seen in a long long time!
What she is living ? I’m gutted!  no !
"Like a hipster's beard in an N95"
I can't cope with the exits for this season. I noticed people were in it less like Kate so assumed that would be the case but I don't see how anyone can replace Kate.
Kate McKinnon is this 21 Century's Lucille Ball!
I cried more when Kate left us than that garbage mutant E.T did
It just isn't the same without Ryan
Doing this at the start sure took a lot from the rest. Shame Aidy and Kyle didn't get a proper goodbye but at least Kate and Pete did.
Really getting old from snl! Same exact skits different actors, smh
Thanks for all the laughs Kate!!!!!!
Hands down Kate is one of SNL’s most talented ensemble member. Period.
I really hope SNL will be worth watching now. Kate was one of the best to ever be on SNL. I will miss seeing her on that stage but i look forward to her future work. Best wishes kate.
I’m not crying your crying. Honestly surprised at how much I grew to love this cast. Especially Kate and Aidy. It always takes me a while to warm to the new people. I went from watching reservedly to just outright loving them in what felt like an instant. Going to miss them.
Awww that was so beautiful
This lady is stupid hilarious!  This cast is special!  Thank you for working during Covid. It was/is very much appreciated!
so good!
This is the best skit snl has come up with.
This was perfect. The alien encounters were my favorite sketches. Farewell, Kate.  Hope to see you soon!
OK WELLLL THAT WAS FREAKIN STUPID
I'm going to miss you Aidy Bryant and Kate McKinnon! SNL will never be the same without you. <3
Legend
awe but she is the show. we will miss her.
Kate McKinnon! Legend! 💚💚💚
The best part of this is Kate McKinnon..I heard and don't know why she is leaving? Big loss for SNL..😢
🤣 🦅 🦅 🤣
Dong hole!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Obviously Kate’s last night?
Kate McKinnon is an absolute legend
SNL has just become a multiverse in the MCU with FitzSimmons
NOoooooooooo she is leaving!!! :(
Best exit ever
What! Didn't know she was leaving SNL. She's been great!
😢 you will be missed.  Best of jubilant in your Adventures.
Priceless.
We will miss you Kate!
I didn’t even know that she and Aidy were leaving. Kate is hilarious is one of my favorites ❤. Aident has been great as well. This was the perfect way to end things. I wish them the best on their future endeavors. 🫡
I really hope Kate finds something she loves after SNL. To be honest, her movie roles haven’t exactly set the world on fire but I’m hoping she rights that ship or lands a great sitcom.
I didn't expect that ending. I almost teared up.
I really don't care that much so idk why the end made me cry. I'm such a weirdo. 😂
Kate had me crying laughing on this one..."Why clean the house if no one's coming over?"  LOL!  I am so going to miss her.
❤️
Good morning everyone
OMG Kate is leaving! I just realized I'm crying now
Already a classic
Nothing but love and the best for Kate! Hope for big things for her. Gonna miss seeing her on SNL!
Pete one of my favorite cast member. Kyle very funny
Let’s hope Kate keeps in touch with us from outer space.
Ohhhhh Nooo I can’t believe Kate Aidy and others are leaving. Kate was one of the greats.
Best sendoff for a cast member ever!  I went from laughing my ass off to crying in seconds.
It's the  elbowing each other and pointing and saying are you seeing this  for me
Well let’s be honest SNL losing Kate and Pete in the same year means 60-70% of the already dwindling audience is now gone.
Love the paranormal skits and will most def miss Kate. On a show with great talents but without leads, she was def my favorite. She’ll be missed. Farewell, Ms. Rafferty.
Can’t wait to see what she does next. She’s Jim Carrey level of talent.
Pete AND Kate???? Omg this episode is so sad 😞  She deserved that beautiful exit more than any other cast member.
Thank you 💋 🤸🏻‍♂️🇺🇸👽🫶🏼
Pubicly speaking 💀
This has been one of my favorite SNL sketch series ever. Sad to see it go, but it would never be the same without Kate McKinnon. Thanks for the many, many laughs.
Yeah, he looks like Fitz Simmons.
I can understand why they would get rid of Pete Davidson (and I'm thankful) but WHY Kate McKinnon? She's the best comedian you have on the show... She's obviously very upset to be leaving so I don't believe this was her choice..
Kate McKinnon, Aidy Bryant, Kyle Mooney, and Pete Davidson all will be my favorite SNL cast members. Kate especially helped me get through the trump years and I’ll always look back on the funny stuff she and all the departing cast members did to fill our homes with laughter! Happy trails!
Thank you, Kate! We'll miss you, but you are legendary.
Probably one of their finest graduates
Say it ain't soooooooooo!   I can't believe she's leaving such a wonderful actress she will be missed next season!
She has been an amazing part of the cast for so many years, best of luck to Kate in the future!
What creates the reality of the forces?
OMG “Why clean the house when no one’s comin’ right?” Kate was put on this Earth to share her gift
We’re all here for Kate ❤️❤️
This really choked me up. I’m gonna miss you Kate. Good luck to bigger and better 🥲🥲👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾❤️❤️❤️
Has she left snl completely?  It’s a shame Ryan Gosling couldn’t have been in the last one of these, It was hilarious watching him try to keep it together.
Late Kate has run out of steam; that s why she is leaving: her jokes are repetitive and stale, they are of poor taste and executed with very little talent.
Kate's features/impressions on SNL of Jeff Sessions, Hillary Clinton and many others gave us laughter and hope during a dark era of not only when we were facing a pandemic, but also during a dark era during the Trump administration.   She will be missed, but never forgotten for holding us down and giving us a few good laughs when we needed them the most.  We all will miss her.
Dude why am I tearing up rn
Aidy, Kate, and that idiot Pete ALL GONE! FINALLY!! These 3 have been there way too long, I am so delighted !!
I'm so emotional from this. What a long strange trip it's been.
"Why clean the house if no is coming over"
Kate won't be one of those cast members that slips off into oblivion.
Ok, I cried a lil at the end there. I love you Kate!
That made me tear up…😢
Brilliant!  100% Kate!
Why clean the house if no one is coming over? 🤣
Kate: "Why clean the house when no one is coming over."  😅👋🙂🙄
Gonna miss both her and Aidy.
Fitzsimmons?!!!!!!
She will be missed!  One of the best.  Pete will be back once akimbo retracts her claws.
This may be my favorite SNL skit
❤ Kate!
Dislike
Lmaoo
Best of luck to Kate McKinnon. She needs to do a one woman show.
Perfection
Kate and aidy thank you so much for all the laughs at snl through out the years, Kate is definitely the best comedians today, she will be amazing outside of snl, I'm looking forward her future, she is up there with Amy Poehler, Tina fey, Gilda radner, Kristen wig, Molly Shannon, Maya Rudolph, etc as one of the best snl comedians. I'm going to miss her through out the next seasons but I know the current cast will do good,  I believe Sarah Sherman will be our next one to be the stand out next shiny stars especially her weekend updates skit poking fun of Colin joist is the best.
Kate's gonna be missed. Definitely one of the few holding this show together. Let's see how it goes from now on :(
Natasha channelling her inner Rue McClanahan
When Kate debuted as Penelope Cruz in a sketch with Sofia Vegara, I knew she was gonna be a breakout star. Kate has solidified herself as one of the true SNL GOATS and even though it was inevitable that she was going to leave since she’s become a big star outside of SNL, we were lucky to see her sign on for a couple more seasons while there have been cast members that would have left immediately after a taste of Hollywood. #thankyoukate
The umpire called timeout had me peeing my pants. Legend
I’ll miss Kate on SNL, but I’m loving her work outside, and wish her so much success. WELL DONE LADY!👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽♥️
This was really hard...Kate McKinnon is one of the best and greatest Comedians around. She will be missed..she got me crying. Pure Legend. Beautiful send-off. Thanks for giving us a wonderful and gracious Kate for 10 years of Laughs. God bless you Kate McKinnon there will never be a great and amazing and beautiful person like you. Goodbye!!!  Love 💕 you!!!  Final Encounter Cold Open 😭😭😭😂😂🤣  LIVE FROM NEW YORK  IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE!!!!
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
I’m not crying
Hats off to Kate! Elegant farewell that left me teary. All the best.
Thank you Kate!
7:11 We love you Kate
I’m going to miss her so much.
Hahaha! I was wondering if she jad some new terms for her privates. Dong hole and wrong hole!! I am laughing so hard right now. I have been watching snl my whole life. Kate is definately one the funniest ppl to have graced the stage.
legend
I’d like to personally shake hands with the person who decided to bring back this sketch. I’ve been waiting soooo long for this! ❤️❤️❤️
Oh my God no I didn't realize she was leaving   I'm devastated
OMFG!  A New One!
I am so sad she is leaving, but she is going to do bigger things, such an ICON definitely one of the BEST at SNL
PLEASE DON'T LEAVE US, KATE!!!! We love you!!!!
'why clean the house if no one coming over' bwahaaa
"the umpire called time out".... I fucking lost it.
Wow.  They were breaking character.  So rare.
Best exit ever GD!
When a send off has me cry laughing and sad crying at the same time. Kate McKinnon and SNL. The end of an era.
not the worst thing ive done on a jumbo tron
May Kate receive 100x the joy she's brought to the rest of. us!
You gave us so much laughter, thank you, best of luck, will miss you.
Kate McKinnon is a National TREASURE!😂😂😂
Truly an SNL that guaranteed you a laugh. Gosh I’ll miss her
How did they know we I was waiting on a new one I can't believe it. Lmao
Didn’t know she was moving on, too. 😕Gonna miss her.
Thank you Kate. One of the best. She will be missed.
i know i sounds stupid now but i alaways hoped kate would never leave snl. but shes so talented she must do more wonderful stuff outside
From the day she first appeared as Penelope Cruz in a Pantene commercial with Sofia Vergara, she has made me laugh. I'll miss Kate McKinnon on SNL.
'I always felt like an alien on this planet anyway' Ms. RAFFERTY 👽
I love Kate♥️What a talented person 💐
I'm too bummed out to even enjoy today's episode because I found out earlier on Twitter about their departure from the show.
Wonderwear"😅🤣😁Kate is soooooo funny that i cant watch her whole segment because im laughing watching how she contorts her face and body....pure genius...
OMG... this one did not disappoint! Kate McKinnon always steals the show on this sketch!!! Funny as hell!
Kate will be missed. She is one of the most talented comedians I have ever seen. This skit, both hilarious and touching in its symbolism, was the perfect farewell to her.
Didn't she already leave once ?
Kates hairy 🐱 is too damn funny
Kate is so wonderful! I cried realizing she is leaving. I hope she goes on to even greater things!
I didn't know she was leaving until she got on the spaceship and started crying and then I went oh no
What!!?  : (
DAMN! That lady will be missed. Legend.
Kate and Aidy are going to be a massive loss.
I only really watch for KT if he leave then i probably won't watch anymore
Finally she back!
Natasha and Kate doing Final Encounter? yall are fucking geniuses
😭😭😭
oh my days im going to miss her so much
So snl let go of the funniest most talented person in the show lol. Good luck.
:( Damn it,.
Goodbye Kate! You will be missed!
Damn my allergies are acting up again. “Sniff sniff”
So the show is about to suck even more
The jokes were horrible. It sounds like they were taken to a GOP sex party.  The middle school props were a great touch.
Between the wonder wear and the n-95 lines, I almost fell off the chair laughing! Kate is beyond AMAZING! ♡♡♡
One of the best SNL characters we've had, I'll miss seeing Kate so much but I'm looking forward to supporting her future projects, the same as Aidy, Kyle and Pete <3
Damn near crying with that send off. I don't know what Kate plans to do next, but I hope it's not too long before we see her again. One of my all-time favorite SNL cast members.
happy she got to say goodbye in one of the funniest characters ever.
Kate McKinnon is a national treasure!
OH NO😲Didn't know Kate was leaving SHE IS A ALL TIME SNL GREAT
I highly anticipated this moment. I am given life!!
She will miss the most
Now wait one darn minute 👏🏽 this sketch is giving Kate is REALLY leaving SNL please please please tell me I’m just looking too deep into this😩 and they’re just retiring THIS sketch ✍🏽 bc I wouldn’t be able to take that
What a send off! Gonna miss Kate on SNL, but wish her the best!
I miss her already.
Thank you for the clarity, Ms. McKinnon.  As of today, I'm no longer "cleaning the house"...
Best. Cold Open. EVER, sad as it is
Damn, got me at the end
Kate McKinnon definitely brings a plus game to this right here
What the hell! Everyone is leaving:(((
Grabbing and “plucking.” That sounds different with a cig in her mouth  😂😂😂
I'll miss her so much 😭💙
Kate’s been in a crap-ton of great sketches, but she single-handedly carries every one of these encounter skits & kills from start to finish 100% of the time. These will be classics one day
Iconic and legendary actress she will be missed from SNL
One of the most creative, imaginative actors in SNL history is gone. Her name belongs with the greats like Murray and Beloshi. Only character in the female Ghostbusters that I liked. Hope her career is successful
Best thing about this show for the last few years
Didn't know Kate McKinnon... My God she was the best in recent years, hope we'll see her again in comedy soon. She's legendary !
She’s leaving!? Ohh no. She’s top notch at SNL! Wow.
I enjoyed her performances on SNL. She was a genius. We needed her and other SNL members during these times. I. wish her best of luck and happiness.
Aw man, sad to see Andy and Kate leaving.
I feel like Aidy was already emotional when the sketch started and honestly same. I basically grew up with Kate on SNL (I was 12 when Kate started). She's made me laugh and inspired me so many times throughout her time on the show. She's truly an amazing comedian, artist and woman. She truly carried SNL with her many characters the last 10 years and she'll be greatly missed on the show.  Can't wait to see her future endeavours!
She had me tearing up at the end when u could see her real emotions coming out about leaving the show. Gonna miss her on SNL, she is amazing, one of the greats
One of the greater SNL stars in its History.
Nothing better in the world than first encounter stitches. Esp. w Kate m.
Oh my gosh I didn’t know she was leaving the show until she said her final lines! She’s the BEST!!!
DONG HOLE AND MY WRONG HOLE
Laughing hysterically and crying! Kate, you are the GOAT! ❤️
damn. what a great sendoff.
Now if they can get rid of a few others this cast might actually get back to where it was, good.
Love you, Kate. Safe travels ❤️
My thoughts of this video? PURELY HILARIOUS KATE AND AIDY.
That was Kates last episode right?
Liberal Garbage 🗑
It's sad to hear that this is Kate's last episode.
So great they continued and what a fantastic send off!
I’ll never forget when she sang, “Hallelujah” right after Trump won in 2016.  One of the best worst moments of my life.
...seriously, SNL...  ...you need to get back into making movies again...  ...a Colleen Rafferty movie...here's my money 🤑
She’s among the best who has ever done SNL. Can’t wait to see her next level!!
Sadly this was the weakest Ms Raverty experiences
She's one of the best ever on SNL! Glad she blessed us with her comedy the last 10 years.. thanks KATE!!!!!
She is a monumental comedic force!!! I adore her! She's kept me from focusing too much on my depression disorder. Love you to bits Miss Kate!!!
Aliens own society behind the scenes this is actually propaganda lol ⚠️👁🥒💦💁‍♀️🦎
Aw, feck - didn't realise the significance of the 'departure' scene - hope the alien technology is worth the loss of KMcK 😕
I didn’t laugh once. SNL is a shitty show.   I predict she’ll have no career after this because in fact she’s not really that funny.   Most People laugh AT her rather than with her.
Watched SNL since the First show 1975. So many talented folks got noticed and famous here. Kate is by Far one of the BEST❣️ Best wishes to Kate and ALL the other departing cast.❤️
Not gonna lie. End got to me a bit. Hairs all standing up as a tribute.........  Thanks for the laughs Kate!!!!
She is truly heaven sent.  The gay community always screamed for acceptance.  We are so very blessed she accepted us.  One of the greatest roll models I have ever seen.  God Bless you Ms. Kate.  Heaven has a very place for you.  You are truly a God sent.
What a legend. Love you Kate and thank you 🥺
Kate definitely left a mark. She’s up there with Will Ferrell, Kristen Wiig, Tina Fey, etc. Thanks for many many years of laughter and amazing times. You’ll be missed but never forgotten. You are the essence of the show 🖤
Why would she tear up... I'm thinking Then it hit me She's Leaving! Dang! Won't be the same without her She was the reason I tuned in, mostly Thank goodness Jost and Che are still there!
SNL has used this sketch plot 3 or more times already. Crisis of ideas. Kate and Aidy are leaving at a right time - SNL turned into a boring, shallow shitteshow.
This is my favorite skit of Kates
END OF AN ERA! BLESS YOU KATE AND AIDY!
Bye Kate. Thanks for all the laughs. I’ll miss you.
Kate cried now I cry.
LOVE HER!!!
I suppose she won't be back next season? She's gonna be missed Best of luck Thanks for making us laugh! 😣
Wait wth Kate's leaving ? Nooooo 😭
Natasha Lyonne is a national treasure. All three of these women really.
Kate is 👌🏾🤌🏿
Normally I love Sunday mornings and am so excited to wake up and watch my favorite show but today I'm really sad watching it. I seriously need time to process the loss.
She was a Gilda Radner level comedienne on SNL, she had no equal - her skits will live on forever
She’s the best 👑
The pentagon refers to this skit as crap
Really a end of a Era I’m going to miss you Kate ❤️❤️❤️🥲🥲🥲🥲
Why clean the house if no one's coming over
Yessssss ! I couldn't believe it ! Another alien encounter skit 🤣🤣🤣👍👍👍
I chuckled at the mention of "Agent Fitzsimonns" for an alien encouter...where are my AoS fans at?
Hahaha!!!
Priceless!
The dong hole and the wrong hole.
kate puts on such a description it almost seems like it was really going on.😂😂😂it was also bc she isn't going to be on SNL along with other great cast members. Did they all have to leave at the same time🐢🐢🐢Cara
Nooooo, not Kate leaving!
🥺💔😭 Sad to see Kate go! 🚀👽🛸  Yet this was a fitting send-off. 💋 The fact that Lez-b-icon Natasha was in the sketch was awesome! ... 🌈(The only thing that would have made it better would have been a cameo at the end by Gillian Anderson!) 🏳️‍🌈 SNL won't be the same without Kate!...  Perhaps there will be bigger & better things, now that she is free! 🤔... Or... 🙏🏽Kate, ❤🧡💛💚💙💜 Will you marry me???
One of my favorite sketch series haha. Classic.
Hell of a send off. I’m gonna miss having her in the show.
Damn what a way to go. She was one of my favorites
Love ya Kate... I hope you have a good, fortunate future ahead of you.
Kate you have marked your star in our funny bone for generations to come. An absolute legend of the snl stage. Thank you. We will miss you.
Aidy can’t leave!!!!! She’s so funny Kate is fuckn hilarious
Some heavy losses this year
I'm going to miss Aidy Bryant & Kate McKinnon. Who's going to play our favorite lesbian couples?
Really some nice poetry in this one. Beautiful.
What the hell man I didn’t even know she was leaving.
Just,all the drugs, bruh, actually...
I love Kate but without the right roles after snl I don’t know how I’ll get my dose
That fortune teller was dead on… 🔮🤣
I'm already missing her
Yea, I cried. Kate you are a true legend.
wow, for once not political.
Wow. Good Luck, Good Kate!
Lmao I want to get drunk with these people
Dang that ending was sweet
I wasn't prepared for emotions here. But A) that's what the character would do and B) I like the actor.
She was the funniest member of the cast since Gilda
She is so good at what she does….Goodbye Kate. Hope you come back one day soon.😢😭
nooooooo! cried when my sister read to me who was leaving. and the only skit that really made me wanna throw up sometimes...  makes the cold open! I will take in every moment! thank you Kate! this is an end of something that was really fun
Bye Kate👋 All the best for your future endeavors!
So many quotes to remember.
Legend
Dong hole & wrong hole. 😂😂. I love kate!!
I broke up with the great love of my life tonight, went to bed early and woke up to this. I still remember Bill and Kristens final episode, and being still so young I’m and in disbelief that eras even existed on SNL. The grief that I feel over Kate, Aidy, Kyle, and Pete’s departure, with SNL being the outlet for joy in my life, is a perfect outlet for the sadness I currently feel.   This skit had me pausing and rewinding to laugh hysterically and watch lines again, it’s bittersweet to have such fantastic joy alongside grief.    I know this comment is gonna belong to the ether, but it feels good to get emotions out in an open space without any expectation of it being read.   I’ll be turning 24 on Wednesday May 25, and It’s hard to reconcile grief for the past with excitement for the future. Delusions of grandeur plague me and I think everyone dreams big, but when Pete said that if he did it- anyone is able to get on SNL, it felt like a call to action and something I’d reference in interviews someday.
Kate is a true staple of SNL, with so many iconic characters. SNL won’t be the same without Kate. I wish her nothing but the best in the future
I am gonna cry...😭😞
This is the best skit behind wknd update
That send off got me sobbing
So when the hell is Kenan leaving? Lol At this point he should just take over once Lorne kicks the bucket.
What a way to go out!!!!
I was caught off guard by the end. She's leaving 🥲😭
That’s too much detail showing it off a cigarette popping out down there!!
SNL will not be the same if it keeps losing its fundamental elements ... The SNL between 2002 to 2020 is, I believe, insurmountable ... How is it possible for such a crew to gather again ... Hard to imagine
lmao “dong hole and wrong hole” 😂
Kate is pretty funny as usual.  Sorry to see her go.
“why clean house if no one’s cummin over”, that was a great line.
2:27 Fifth Force confirmed!
Losing too many good ones.
I got choked up 😞
5:24 Kate takes the cigarette out of her mouth cause she realises when she says “plucking” it sounds like an f bomb 😂
It always sucks to see an SNL member, who you love to watch every weekend and make you laugh, leaves the show. So many legends come and gone, but watching them go is always sad. Thanks for all the laughs.
😥
Absolute legend! Long love Kate!
This is too much...Pete and Kate are such SNL symbols 😭 take Cecily away and I am gone...this is not fair...
Aww man 😭
Love you Kate!!! Thank you!! 🙌🏼
How amazing.....
She is really gone people and this is no joking matter. This skit is propaganda used to hide the fact that humans have been exchanging talent with aliens for the last ten decades. Your biggest stars are taken and replaced with alien counterparts. They still haven't found an adequate replacement for Madonna but negotiations are on going.
SNL Hall Of Fame
Grabbing and F*****g? Kate you're great
Kate McKinnon is brilliant.
Absolute legend. SNL will never be the same. I look forward to seeing her future projects. All the best Kate!
Epic, just like Kate!
Female version of Ron white
I cried. Going to miss you Kate.
Love me some Natascha,  a russian doll indeed.
Wow 😮 SNL will NEVER 👎🏽 be the same without her. Kate you ARE just incredible. From Rudy to the Long Island Medium, and RBG, you did it ALL. There was NOTHING you couldn’t do. We will miss you 😢 beyond words. Wishing you all the best on your new endeavors. NO, I’m NOT crying 😢 🙏🏽😇❌⭕️👋🏽😢
I love Kate but this sketch was boring the first time and they just keep on doing it
Aaand there go the waterworks.
Ohhhh !!! ❤️
Wait, Kate is leaving the show? That's the end of an era. Good luck for her in whatever comes next!
She can come back and host!
It's not Kate leaving. It's the heart and soul leaving SNL's body.
It truly is the end of an era
How did Natasha Lyonne not lose it
I can’t wait for her to come back and host. Everyone is going to be so missed, but the hope of hosting makes it a little easier
Thank you Kate for the laughs and memories. SNL will forever be your home
It’s an end of an era. Kate is SNL Royalty.
Why don't qee see Alex Baldwin anymore? Karma caught up to him laughing 😃 😀 😄 😁 🤣
🤣😂☠
Was trying to break Natasha…. But she held fast 👏👏
Wow such great cast members. Gonna miss Aidy and Kate.
There's a special lot that stands above em all. You darling Kate are one of the true gems.
I’m not crying, YOURE CRYING!!!!!
Oh noo..  I will miss her
Oh, I didn’t know this was her last night.  💔. What an spectacular send off.
I didn't notice any mention of the tragedy in Buffalo on May 14. Wish they would have done something: candles, an "In Memoriam"panel before a commercial , something. That happened in upper New York state. R.I.P., Buffalo 10. GOD bless the 3 wounded who are recovering.       #Black Lives Matter✌🏼✊🏼
Love those legs more apart 😀😀😀
But why permanently? She can host SNL and have the character back.
She’s leaving? Nooo she was the reason I watch snl it’s not gonna be fun anymore 😔
Omg the 👽  are real..
Natasha did not break
SHE WENT OUT LIKE A BOSS. STRAIGHT LEGENDARY
Always loved this character but this skit seemed off. Like the energy wasnt there but still sweet maybe cuz the undertone was sad
She did a good Hilary, although I thought Amy Poeler's was better. Her Lindsay Graham was hilarious. Very talented.So many great characters.👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
AWW, Nice way for Kate to say goodbye to SNL. No doubt, she will succeed in any new pursuit in her life. 👏🤗
God why😭
Too bad that your ratings are so low that Gosling wouldn't show up.
Am I the only one who thinks the only time Kate ever broke character as Ms Ruperty was her final scene, waving goodbye?  She is a legend. Gonna miss her
That has got to be 1. The most hilarious 2. Perfect out of a character since Stephon. 10/10
Will really miss Kate. I hope she comes back to host multiple times in the future.
I can’t believe after all that nonsense of this skit, that I got genuinely choked up like she did in the end! 😢 She can always be surprisingly tender. Gonna miss you Kate.
Kate McKinnon has been an absolute pleasure to watch for these many seasons. A great exit skit. Love you, Kate. 💗
Kate is my favorite on SNL, such a loss for us but I wish her the best!
Please cancel this show ..painfully unfunny
Kate 🥺💔💕
The Umpire called time out……🤣🤣🤣🤣
I want an X rated version of this as a movie.
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
I love this sketch so much!
Nothing but love for Kate. What a legend. ❤️
SNL is done
Who is cutting onions?😢
God's speed, miledy!
I quit watching SNL two years ago. I got really tired of the political spoofs. The same characters, the comedians trying to be funny got really annoying to me. Not worth staying up late. Sleep was a better option. Remember MAD tv? I loved that show. These are my opinions, you have your own and that is ok.
i am going to miss her.
Kate I miss you already you are my world and the love and light of my life. You’re going to go and do so many more amazing things and I really can’t wait for all of it but this goodbye is so bittersweet. These past 10 years with you have been the absolute best and I will forever cherish the love and the laughs you’ve given me. I love you, you goddess and absolute LEGEND you will always be my favorite comedian and my favorite little angel that achieved all her dreams and more. I know 13 year old you is so immensely proud of you, as am I. I adore you with everything in me I’m so proud of you and I will forever love you thank you for changing my life.
👏❤️🥲❤️👏
I already miss Kate. 🧡😔🧡
THANK YOU KATE! 🥰🙌
I haven't watched in awhile, but saw on Fallon the ladies were leaving, so I made sure to watch.
😭😭😭😭 nah, she cant be leavin' ..... we will miss her sooooo much
That was the funniest one yet!  Edited to add:  well, damn... I didn't realize that was her final show.  😭
👏👍👏💗👏👍👏
OMG Mckinnon you are killing me 😂😂😂 Almost peed myself laughing 😅😅
I saw Kate's expression when she said good bye. I take it she's leaving?
🤣😍🤪❤😂
kate is one of the beatings hearts of snl - i’m going to miss her so much :(
Kate is just OK tbh… maybe im just different. Cecile is like 5 times funnier..
Trying to extrapolate how many Greys got Miss Rafferty beach ready. One huge ass spacecraft.
With out Cecily Strong as the Straight woman,  for all my deep love of Kate, these would never be as Classic as they are
Loved watching her so much in the UK for all these years, she had been brilliant all these years...good luck to her 💜
Man that me teary! But I’m happy for her. She’s so funny and I hope we see more and more of her! Good job on SNL! Bravo!
Kate is the only reason I got into SNL at the beginning. Very sad to see her go
Goodbye Kate!🥺 Such a comedic GENIUS...You ARE SNL, and you will be so missed!!! ❤
can’t believe she’s leaving SNL
Beautiful.
"My dong hole and my wrong hole." 🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀
Aw she was choking up at the end 🥺
Great finale for McKinnon....Probably the MVP at SNL...Mooney and Bryant also deserve a lot of credit for their contributions over the last few years. Davidson ?..Over-hyped and an acquired taste I never acquired..One day he might actually do something funny...At least Cecily and Keenan and the others will get new playmates...
That not so enthusiastic "And live from New York it's Saturday Night" hit me so damn hard. Gosh 😭
She really wanted to break Natasha but she was like "sorry, not Ryan Gosling." 😂
Kate you are the best!!!  Why are you leaving me?!
Losing Kate and Pete in one episode, I think Cecile leaving too. End of an era
One of the worst SNL opens ever
Omg what!? Not Kate! No wonder she was so teary! I love Kate. She sang me down when the despot won. She’ll always have a special place in my heart ❤️
Why clean the house if nobody's comin' over. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’d youll excuse me I’m now entering a period of mourning for the loss of our Queen 😭
Kate really is leaving??? I'm sick.
Don't think the words "Live from New York, it's Saturday night!" have ever sounded so bittersweet
And two more join the INCREDIBLE list of comedic women from SNL that have given us so much enjoyment over the decades Shine on Aidy, Shine on Kate.....Aloha
kate is so brilliant that she will be good at whatever she decides to do, just sad to see her go.
Idk why I'm crying so much over this.... It's not like she's retiring and going off the grid. I guess I always just assumed she'd be the Tom Brady of SNL
A hall of fame SNL comedy legend, the amazing, brilliant, irreplaceable Kate Mckinnon will leave a ever lasting legacy on the show. look forward to all the creative brilliance she will offer next in film and comedy.
How very much Kate, Aidy, Kyle, and Pete will be missed.  What a great skit but it does not lessen the loss that so many of us will feel. Thanks for the laughs and thanks for the memories. Stop by every once in a while just to say hello. I wish you all much success moving forward.
I’m simply heartbroken that Kate is leaving. I have this sadness that’s just not going away 😥
Wait, WHAT???? HOLY HELL, I REALIZED WHAT THIS WAS DURING THAT FINAL APPLAUSE! SHE CANT GO!!!! 😭😭😭
Hey E.T., take care of our Ms. Rafferty. She (coot-coot, prune shute and all) will be greatly missed😥🥰
Greatness. Happy Sunday 💐🎈 Lynn
Bruh whoever that lady was laughing so loudly in the background is what made me laugh lmao she should be in every SNL sketch audience
Thank you for being a great gay role model!
Now this is funny  !
Of course, Kate would leave us with one of the strangest, most disturbing, and weirdly hilarious images ever shared on TV lol... Aidy, Cess, Mikey, and Natasha are total pros for not breakin during this sketch!
Goodbye Miss Rafferty ❤️
Now I am sad that I found it, it is her last show.
If I were an 👽 I'd abduct her too  Edit: holy crap why am I tearing up
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
farewell Kate we will miss you.
Late, we're all looking forward to seeing you host and eventually make it into the Five Timers Club!  Thanks for being awesome!
God she is absolutely AMAZING. Throw any name and character out there and she could play them all!  A MASTERCLASS!!!!
Good bye to one of the greatest….
I have always LOVED that the Hulu thumbnail for SNL is a pic of their group. I chuckle each time at her and Liev
She rocks , the best . I didn’t know it was her last bit . Great job Kate , can’t wait to see what the future holds .
Thank you Kate for all the laughs.
I somehow didn’t get the memo that she was leaving and I kinda feel like the ground was just pulled out from under me
Definitely one of the funniest series of skits in the last decade and one of the funniest comedians on SNL for a long time. I was born in 1977 and remember watching SNL when I was 5 years old. My mom would let us stay up late and watch it every Saturday. Started the morning with cartoons and finished the day with SNL. I've been a life long fan fot about as long as this show has been airing. So many great actors and actresses got their start on this show and went on to become some of the most well know and loved movie stars of all time. Dan Aykroyd as Jimmy Carter talking the caller down from a bad acid trip, Steve Martin and Richard Pryor doing the job interview, Eddie Murphy doing white face and going to the bank for a loan. The list goes on and on. She definitely earned her place up on the wall with her fellow SNL alumni as one of the greats. What an awesome way to leave the show too. Hope we see more of her and she continues with her acting career.
The "wonderwear" joke murdered me.
For many years, Kate was the only things holding the show together. I hope she finds happiness in the next chapter!
🙄🙄😪 simply put......... I hate when they fucking leave Kate,jay,jimmy,tracy,tina etc.......
Last of the greats
SNL won't be the same without her
Aww Mann🥺
0:25 Fitzsimmons????!!!! Agents of SHIELD!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
How lucky have we all been to have a front row seat to her brilliance for all of these years?? Wishing her nothing but the absolute best. Thank you Kate <3
Snl is really funny but they repeat the same exact sketch wayyyyy too many times
I can't wait to see who the new cast members are going to be.
Gonna miss you Kate! Best of luck to you in all your future adventures
🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
Why did she leave!!!!!!!!  They should have kept her!
What....why is kate leaving? No. I am not american but she truly is a national treasure. Snl wont be the same anymore
She has been the best part of SNL over the years, and this has been the best of all the sketches she has been part of!!  She will surely be missed!!
“Why clean the house is nobody’s coming over” 🤣
"and then what happened next?" "The umpire called timeout" Lmfao 😂
The one and only, Kate McKinnon.
Wow, this was great. Thank you for all the laughs for so many years. THANK YOU
nothing new here. Christmas one is best
Kate‼️What a true and multi talented comedian, going to miss her characters, her voices, acting. Looking forward to all her future endeavors. Congratulations Kate McKinnon‼️You are missed ❤️‼️
😱 she can’t leave!!!!
Damn, I've been a fan of Kate since she was on the big gay sketch show. I'm going to miss seeing her.
Yeasty and Beasty were in full view. 😂😂😂
Aww I’m hella mad she was fasho key
nooo I don't want kate to leave 😭 (even if she is going on to better things 🛸)
DAM WTF!!! LMAO KID'S!!!!
HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!! My dong hole and my wrong hole. HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAH!!!!
I love that gal Kate McKinnon so much.. you're a gem gurl!!
What an end to an era! Things aren't going to be the same without Kate and the others, but I'm sure they'll be successful wherever they go. As for the new cast members, they have big shoes to fill, but given how stacked this lineup is, I can't wait to see what they have in store for us.
Gonna miss Kate damn she was amazing thank u for all the laughter
The empire called time-out :)
Brilliant 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏
She's gonna have a hit series after this. Talent like that doesn't just fade.
Legendary
Never knew there were so many names for holes in the body ;)
I love that she didn’t scream it. From her, a subdued & earnest “live from New York,…”, as farewell was perfect. Holy smokes. Kate McKinnon is a treasure. Wow. 💕
I smell a daytime talk show for Ms. McKinnon. Who else can replace Ellen?
I'll miss Aidy and Kate
Out with class
Wow...BRAVO!
love kate but glad she's making way for chloe fineman and melissa villasenor to get more screentime!
Got a little misty eyed: thought about the times Ryan Gosling was in the skit. That was pure magic.
I love Kate McKinnon. I got to be a person she made laugh. Thank you.
😭😭😭I’ll miss you Kate.  You are one of my all time fave cast members! Your sketches are always the funniest!
Damn Kate was my favorite cast member. I can’t wait to see what she does next though!
I'm laugh crying and I don't care if this whole coffee shop sees me.  Thanks for the memories Kate! xoxo
By faaarrrrr my favourite SNL character...I love you Kate❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love it
'Dong hole and wrong hole', lmao!  There's no 'wrong hole' there, they're both dong holes.
Kaaaate!!!! Noooooo! Don’t leave me!!! I’ve loved Kate since her days on Big Gay Sketch Show!!! Uuugh!! Thank you for the amazing sketches over the years!!! You’re a legend! 💗💗
SNL The traditional pop culture meter.  Who remembers when they were the not ready for prime time players?  I think it goes on because it adapts. "Colleen" is the envy of many xelinniel rn and I will miss her. GREAT NEWS!  We can see her whenever we like. On YouTube. Which is still free now.   Go with grey's now, Kate, I look forward to what you do next. 🕊️✌️🕊️😎
She's always been so funny in this skit. The way she always breaks character and had the other SNL cast members break character. This was so funny. 🤣🤣
SNL better work hard to find some new talent, or next season is going to SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK.
What a talent, wasn’t always my cup of tea but kate could make chicken salad out of chicken shit
Bye bye Kate 🥲
yeah i love waking up and crying about Kate Mckinnon
Why is everybody leaving?
Love this....
"Why Clean the House..." Killed It for Me!!! 🤣🤣🤣
I was expecting Kate to stuff her head right into Natasha's lap 😂😂😂
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
Adi trying to keep a straight face while Kate's doing her thing is priceless!!!
KMcK almost breaking character=priceless "..clean the house..."
“I always felt like an alien on this world”
Damn, I think I have something in my eye.
🤍🖤🤎💜💙💚💛🧡❤
"Why clean the house if no one is coming over?"
Oh, God, this show and its’ atmosphere will not be what it is, without the presence of Kate McKinnon, Aidy Bryant, Kyle Mooney, and Pete Davidson, together.   They were some of the best additions to Saturday Night Live, in such a long time.   Goodbyes are a real “B”, but you know, new things come in place. Thank you, all! And Kate, as your “Hillary Clinton” once said, “I’m never giving up, and neither should you.”   ✌🏻❤️😌
Did she do Olya Pawlotski
LEGEND
What a great ending! Got me tearing up. Thanks for all the great SNL moments Kate; you provided a lot of laughs during some very dark times.
Kate has to do more, Mrs. Raftery skits. She is so f*&^%$g funny. I want to see a feature length Miss Rafferty Movie. Two goddamn hours of this kind of comedy. Kate McKinnon just kills it! With Ryan Gosling.
Gonna miss Aidy and Kate!!!
KATE, I'm going to miss you so much!!! I freakin' love you!
I will tear up 💔 I absolutely love Kate and am happy for her that she will do big things ❤️
That  ending sort of looked like the opener of the music video "Forever Young" by Alphaville.
hold up...Is kate finally leaving???????
I'm so emotional right now! Kate was the reason I started really watching Snl again and now she's gone! I am so happy for her, I know she will be amazing at whatever she does in the future and I can't wait to see it! Alot of greats have come and gone and now Kate is one of them!
i’m crying my eyes out
We love you Kate!!! One of the greatest on SNL
She was touched you can hear her voice crack I felt it too when she spoke.
Trump 2024
last time she said Live from New York it´s Saturday night 🥲
Beck Bennett is already gone if Kate is going. The show is going to feel very empty. It's going to take time for SNL to get someone on her level.
Kate the Great! You have brought me so much laughter and smiles in ur SNL years.Thank you!Godspeed on ur next adventure.I will be watching for you.
I know the new cast is great....It's just still hard.  Damn.
Nooooo, don't go!!
🥲
Ohhhhh, and Aidy Bryant too.  Oh, man....I didn't know.
Ohhhhhh I didn't know she was leaving.  Oh man.   I guess it's time, but still.  :''(
I will miss, Kate!😢😢😢
We love you here… We love you there… We love you everywhere! Oh Kate! So Much Talent The World Is Your Oyster!
✨✌️👽✌️✨
Crying from laughter then crying because Kate is easily one of.SNL's best ever and will be missed.
Holy shit.   Blessed with two legends.   Bill Heder and Kate McKinnon.   Can't say anymore than that.
this was so sad and funny
Hold on…..Kate is leaving too?!?!?!?! NOOOO! She’s one of my absolute FAAAAAAVS on this show!
I know some of the laughing seals in the audience think it's about them, but it's not. You don't have to be the one that out laughs, cheers, or claps louder than everyone else in the audience, it's not a competition. It would be nice to hear a joke from start to finish without someone in the audience intervening so we could actually hear what's being said.
I cried at the end. She is absolutely amazing and very talented. Hope she will get great projects in the future that will allow her to show her talented.
I didnt know that this was the last show für Kate McKinnon, but even without knowing the scetch and the applause and everything, it got really touching. I knew there is "something" going on of course. Now i read this in the comments here. What amazing actress. We will miss you.
so Kate's leaving SNL? oh, ok...
"Why clean the house if nobody's comin over" I am dead 💀 🤣
Kate is the GOAT.
The sexual tension between Kate and Natasha😏
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
My favorite SNL skit!!!!
Tears.
The first one of these sketches was what brought me to SNL. I'm in England and now I never miss them on here. Still rewatch them. Shame it's finished but a great ending
Awww,, this got sad at the end😭
This was funny and sad at the same time. Kate will be missed.
😐 how much longer, SNL? The show hasn't been funny in decades.
Wooow. Great comedian, great finale. Thank you
Kate got choked up. She will be missed.
SNL is all the worse without Kate McKinnon. She was a huge reason this show is awesome.
She blew the entire prop budget on those aliens if she was going out it was going to be with a bang
wow.
So amazing, Kate is a comedy icon, will miss her on SNL.
😂😂😂😂pubicly speaking. 😂😂😂
4:11 I really almost made a joke about the gap junction and the Book of Vacanti lol
Oooo why is she leaving the show?
SNL hasn't been funny in years. How can they afford to pay people to make positive comments on Youtube?
god i am so in love with kate
We love you Kate
She was feeling it at the end......
Not even remotely funny.
The funny thing is all three of their accounts align with experiences one can potentially have on N,N-DMT.
They should have put Lyonne on the end and she if she could have outdone Kate.
I didn't know that this is Kate McKinnon's last show! Well, I guess I'm feeling old now. I'll miss her character Dr. Wayne Wenowdis. It's not fair! We haven't gotten rid of covid-19, yet.
They did this bit as a cold open?? This is an old as shit bit isn’t it?
So how many decades is Keenan Thompson going to be on SNL? People are leaving and moving on, and this guy, who is responsible for some of the WORST Sketches on SNL "WHAT UP WITH THAT?" is STILL on?
Waaaah!
Aidy and kate leaving has me in my feels
What a great sendoff. will miss her a lot and wish her the best!!💞
Legend.
She’s got me crying there. This has been such a great cast for so long.
Lol good to see Chris Wray got the Pentagon subpoena
Oh fuck is Kate leaving?  I no longer want to be in SNL
Don't forget about aidy Bryant
We sure needed that laugh Kate please let us know when you’re ready 💫
One for the history books. May Kate enjoy decades of success on whatever she sets herself to.
Shes amazing, bottom line
Amazing
Hilarious 😂 bless her!🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love that woman, but she doesn´t know it.
Didnt know she was keaving.  That sucks
Did she just low-key get "grabbin and f**kin" on air twice before switching to pluckin?
No more Ms Rafferty and Baby Yoda....Damn !!!
I don't like change so , don't tell me! I love SNL just as is.
Man I almost fall out of my chair laughing everytime I watch these..great stuff
That Kate McKinnon! SNL will not be the same without her. She would have me in the floor dying laughing! And with his skit she did not disappoint! The woman just knows how to have fun with her characters.  Will deeply miss you!
#loveit
All the comments saying Kate is leaving. Omg my heart
This gave me chills
👽 🍰 ⚾ ~ 🙌⛩️🚀⛩️🙌.  be good~!
Finally
😭🤣❤️💔
I wanna go to the hot sauce convention with ya’ll!!! And since those kind of things take place in the American SouthWest, not that far-fetched that you’d experience aliens there.
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂👽👽👽👽👽
Holy moley! Hilarious!
I'm gonna be missing Kate.
I absolutely adore Kate. With every episode that came on since Ms. Rafferty's debut I was always hoping for her to make an appearance.  Even though she broke once in awhile I don't know how she kept it together at all!  Kate, thank you.  I hope to see you return as host once in awhile.  Also a shout out to your please hump it and your cheese trumpet.  Oh yeah...and also a thank you to Cecily and Aidy who both appeared in nearly every Ms. Rafferty bit.  Best of luck in your future endeavors Kate.  We love you!
🖖🏼 So long Kate! Wishing you all the best on your spaceship 🚀. ❤️ You.
You were one of the greats, Kate. Thank you for all these years of laughter.
What absolute inspiration and genius Kate is. We were so so lucky to have her on SNL for so long
Dang! Just like that, she’s gone…😩
Monkey time!
Field of Dreams lol
I have a comment with almost 6k likes on the Christmas Miracle alien encounter video.  Suffice to say they have a special place in my heart.
Ah shit. I didn't realise it was her last show. It just won't be the same. That devilish pleasure she took in trying to get the others to break always stood out to me. All the very best for what I am sure will be extraordinary future endeavours.
Back when SNL was funny
yeah she is good  but they give her too much attention   i mean she is not the only one leaving and yet it was done like she is only cast member there
I actually teared up at the end. i'm gonna miss kate sm, she was definitely one of snl's best and it won't be the same without her
Dong hole and wrong hole...I've got to start writing these down.
Kate I almost cried 😢
My koot kootin' and prune shootin'!  Play the hits.
Hilarious
End of a fucking era.
Couldn’t think of a better send off for McKinnon and Bryant. SNL just won’t be the same without them.
OMG! I have been waiting for a new alien abduction skit and here it is! Cannot get enough of it. Kate, genius
I’m sure she’ll make an appearance once more.
Kate’s leaving!!!!
Darn. She's leaving😖😭 .... May success treat her better than the knockers, plowers, picker hair green little bastards 🍾
Why clean the house if nobody's coming over?  Classic!
Kaaaaaate!!  😭😭😭❤
Kate is a legend. One of the funniest cast members of all time.  SNL won't be the same without her.    I know she'll go on to great things, but it's hard to say goodbye.   Thankfully, we're in good hands with Cecily, Melissa, Chloe and Sarah.
Girl is funny as hell 💪
Natasha sucked
Kate McKinnon is my hero!!
Dong hole and wrong hole 😂😂😂😂😂
7:28 It hits her hard that this is her last one. We’re sad too, Kate. We’ll miss you. 😢
I going to miss seeing her so regularly. Good luck in your next adventures, Kate.
When she finally makes it back to host she will definitely be getting off the ship and I can't wait
Holy little gray aliens…I (and SNL) will miss the wickedly funny, exceptionally talented Kate.  And Aidy too!
Her tears at the end…🥲❤️  We love you Kate!❤️
ok. that got to me. so long Kate.
oh no can't believe she is leaving SNL.  What an amazing  performer  one of the main reasons I glued to  SNL  can't believe she leaving now
“Cold open.” Eat crap! Unfunny show!
Oh no! Not Kate! She's like one of the funniest ones. God damn it! 😡
What an amazing performance by an amazing person. Cheers to all her future endeavors.
Goodbye Kate McKinnon, Aidy Byrant, Pete Davidson and Kyle Mooney. We will miss you guys <3
So, I’ve had a rough night and I came here to be cheered up.  Narrator: *she was not cheered up*
AWESOMENESS
Wait.... what? Nooooo! I am not ready for this. SNL without Kate? Nooo.   Oh my. I guess I will have to cope.   Good luck with those aliens! <3
👏👏 Love you, Kate. Best of Luck
Fuck yes!!!!
Can't wait for the next installment when she returns as host in 7 years or so. Seriously though, difficult to imagine SNL without Kate.
I'm crying. I love you, Kate!!! So excited to see what's to come of you!
🤣😂😆😅🥲🙂😐😑😥😢😭😭😭😭😭
Why does she reach for the thighs for the pubic hairs 👀
Was NOT expecting that to hit me how hard it did
N95 will never be the same.
The first one was probably my favorite, if only because Ryan Gosling was cracking up so bad, as was Aidy Bryant. Still, what an amazing comedic talent.
Donghole and the wrong hole!!!
I fought the tears when she was holding hers back as she said "Live from NY is Saturday Night!" one last time 🥺. You were awesome Kate.
I can’t help but cry. Kate you’re a staple and a legend. We love you
You’ll be missed Kate!! ❤️
This was perfect. I started crying when she did. SNL won't be the same without her.
Mikey Day is the best at holding his composure on the show. I have never seen him break character.
How will we continue without Kate!? Thank you for years of mirth and outrage.
Pubicly speaking, it’s a jungle down there 😂
I got emotional. Kate has been one of the most memorable, funniest and multi faceted members. I will miss you dearly!
Waaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh! 😥
All Hail Cecily Strong, the talented and beautiful Queen of TV!
I had no idea this was happening I was so excited that I got to see this skit again. Now I’m crying
Kate is a real treasure.
Kate doing this character--just like Alex doing "Guy Who Just Bought a Boat"--is one of the most incredible and rapid deliveries of tricky dialogue I've ever witnessed. Master class...every single time!
WAIT WHY IS SHE LEAVING SNL??   (I mean I'd take her over all of SNL so also sucks for them)
Goddess.
Best ever
Absolute gem.Loved this send off....laughing and crying here.
KATE 😭😭😭😭
Fucking Legend <3  I cant.  I just fucking cant.  🎲😑
Kate: "I realized this might be the most stable relationship I've ever had!" Aidy: "Well that's unfortunate...." LOL!
Kate, thank you for my sanity- and helping me keep it, for sooo much laughter throughout the years, 🤣 and now... the tears. 😢 You're the Goat, in my book.  Wishing you warm memories and an even brighter future. ❤  Thank you dear Ms. McKinnon. 🙏🏻
Cheers for the legend!!
😂👏👽😢😢😭💔
What an emotional sendoff. Kate McKinnon you will be missed! There's almost always somebody on the show who is so versatile they can be in any sketch and do anything and Kate McKinnon was one of those incredibly versatile not ready for Primetime players. Saturday Night Live is going to need to replace her with three people...
👽 🚀🥺😭🤍🖤🤎💜💙💚💛🧡❤
Kate is the reason I watch SNL. She is brilliant. Well done and we are going to miss you.
With any luck she will return one day as a Host!
One of the greats.
Awwww SNL is gonna suck now
Take a bow, Kate.
OMG is this Kate's last episode????
The Colleen sketches kill it every time and I'm so glad that we got to see her one more time (I'm hoping that she will return to earth when Kate comes back to host).
Best!!!!!💋💋💋💋
Shouold have closed with this
The ending was so sad :(
We love you, Kate! You are one of the best to ever do it!
Kate McKinnon really grew on me. Gonna miss her on SNL.
Pubicly speakin
Wait, special agent Fitz-simmons? Did I hear right? Was that an Agents of SHIELD reference?
You and your dong chute and wrong chute.  You're one of the greats, well wishes.
oh.. is this her last season?  damn, I had no idea.
THESE ARE MY FAVORITES
WAAAA FINAL SHOW? sad face. MAD FUNNY SET!!! was all I was gonna say. Shizzzz why not go out on top that was just a great open and skit period. Fantastic
What the heck??? Pete and Kate leaving?!? Bye SNL, you had a good run!
😭
That was a CLASSY exit! Well done Kate! I million thanks!
goddamn it not km! this caps off a shitty day, week, month...infinity
Truly a legend. We’re not worthy queen 👸
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
"kinda different down in 3rd class" "back in economy, words out about my harry squatter" 🤣 We ALL love you Kate ❤️
I was so excited for this skit. And then I realized Kate is leaving SNL and now I’m just a puddle of emotions on the floor. 😢😭 I’m gonna miss her so much
Damn 😭😭😭 One of SNLs all time best performers 💔❣️This is just the beginning for Kate.
This is the funniest SNL skit I’ve seen in a long time
Nooooo, Kate, Don't goooooooo!😭😭😭😭😭❤️, but thank you, you are the legend😎❤️❤️❤️
made me cry watching it live
Leave us Kate and take Pete!
Good Luck to you in all of life's travels.
One of the SNL legends for sure.  ✌️❤️
Until the next time Kate when you're guest hosting the show!
How does Kate make this Ms Rafferty funnier each time?? 😂 I will miss her!
❤️ Kate
Wtf I am not ready for her to leave SNL
SNL just got a little less gay
I’m gonna miss the knockers :(
OMG....YES!!! ONE OF THE BEST SERIES OF SKETCHES THAT SNL HAS EVER DONE. PURE GOLD I've been watching snl for a very long time and Kate is, without a doubt, the BEST cast member that they've ever had, in my opinion. We were lucky that we got to know her💕
tragically ironic... not really funny
I got so upset when I realized Kate was leaving SNL ….
Kate McKinnon why you make cry
Damn I feel like crying now
I love the "it's a jungle down there" call back. Only real fans know
She finally  light  that cigarette
Damn! I missed the beginning of the show, and only at the end realized she was leaving.  Had to come find this. She's one of the greatest to ever come out of this show. Truly going to miss her many, MANY impressions.  Kate will never be topped.  Thank you for all of the laughs, often when I've needed them most.
Why did the aliens need to take Kate McKinnon when they obviously still had Ryan Gosling?
Much love ❤️
ngl I cried - as is known Kate is ridiculously talented and just seeing her on screen has meant a lot to me. I know she'll be missed and I wish her luck in her next chapter <3333
Nooooo this can’t be the end 🥹🥹🥹
I feel so emotional that Kate & Aidy are leaving!
Just saw a comment on a Facebook post about some cast members leaving and someone said they hoped Kate would do one more “kidnapping by aliens” one more time before she left
Holy shit, THIS was the opener? And I missed the episode? Noooooooo!
I just found out that the damn near whole cast is leaving SNL. HOW DID Y'ALL KNOW?! You can see it on her face when she's saying goodbye..... Damn man,... Sniff sniff😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Why clean the house if no one's coming over? Adios, Kate... won't be the same without you.
"Wonder-wear , I call them that because if you seen them then you'd wonder-where they been" 🤣 😭
We love you Kate!
“But hey, why clean the house if nobody’s coming over, right?” 😂 So sad to see her go & what a perfect cold opening to do it. Just wait til she comes back to host! She’ll be amazing! I think of Kate like a female version of Will Ferrell - they both took the show to another level, but there’s no one like Kate. She will make us laugh hysterically on the big screen & create an even bigger name for herself. Love you, Kate! ❤️
Sounds like Kate has been going to Cheryl Tunt's Old Gypsy Woman!
Kate is one of the greatest SNl members ever, her impressions are the best
Play the hits 😂😂😂😂😂
I didn' even know she was leaving... Not gonna lie, my heart sunk to my stomach when I saw her tearing up. She's a great actress with a fantastic sense of humor and I just know that whatever she does will be amazing. It's sad to see her go, but she's going to do more great things.
Great sendoff for an absolute legend. One of the best to ever grace the SNL stage. All the best on her future endeavors. 🏁
Kate and Aidy, two best things about SNL for the past decade
I never imagined this day would come truly gonna miss her 🥺
We’ll miss you, Kate!! 💔
I love the lore that Kate’s character and Cecily’s character became close friends
So sorry to see her leave the show but she couldn't have left in a better way.
Please snl make this a movie
😭
AWEE😭🥺🥹💐best of luck. The encounter videos were the ones that got me into snl years ago
legend
That was excellent. I laughed so hard and then I welled up with her at the end. Such great memories they’re leaving us. 🥺
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
What are we going to do without her?!?!
Sad to see her go.  I hadn't watched SNL regularly in nearly a decade until Kate joined the cast.  She is always an AMAZING talent to watch perform!  Fair winds to her, Aidy, Pate and Kyle!
ha ha ha. ha? this was funny to.... who?
RX laugh
Kate McKinnon is like a second coming of carol Burnett. Gonna miss ya Kate. Good luck
Nice to her her character finally catching a positive break in some way. Can't believe Kate McKinnon's not gonna be on SNL anymore. Not gonna be the same without her.
Natalie & Kate have middle age lesbian aunt vibes in this skit & I am absolutely here for it
"I think...what the hell, I'm play the hits, right??" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dong hole and wrong hole!!
Awwwww.. that's so sad they're leaving, especially Kate..
NOOO IM GONNA MISS THEM SM
Fricking Hilarious 😂!!!!
This was one of the most heartbreaking, funny things I've ever witnessed. I can only hope that Kate will go up from here!
Such an awesome way to send off such a wonderful person!
God speed and great adventures to you Kate! I hope your journey is filled with great joy and many miracles, and amazing stories!  Say hi to Elvia for us.  XD
why are they leaving if theyre so great, dont get it
Not as funny as the previous extraterrestrial skits and McKinnon could have done without the other 2 abductees who brought nothing to the comedy table.
That was graphic and crude.  I haven't laughed that hard in quite a while.
Who else choked up as they realized this is her goodbye?
I really don’t know what this show will do without the 4 cast members that are leaving. They truly hold the show together
That felt like good old SNL blind side cold open. Felt It. ...she's right atcha with the cooch. Works every time. :)
Kate will always be favorite cast member, also I'm pretty sure she dropped the F-bomb,and I'm lovingly her final episode even more.
Eww not me crying in public 😢 hope to see Kate again doing fun things ❤
It seems they all lack energy. Like they used ro be. Its pathetic
What will the show even so without Kate and Aidy?
Kate is such a star and I did not know all these people are leaving until I read these comments I am devastated
Can’t believe Kate is leaving! This skit was the ending she deserved.. she will be greatly missed. She had me in stitches many times.. not gonna lie, I tested up at the ending.
*"So long...farewell...auf wiedersehen...adieu* ( *Kate...you were the 'Best' since John Belushi* ) ________________ *I wonder if 'SNL' can survive this mass exodus?*  *I've been a fan since 'day one' in '75  and would like to see 'SNL' continue...but how much input does Lorne really have anymore at almost 80?*   *Does he even care for his 'Baby' anymore?*
I don’t get all the praise for mckiinon. Like, she is ok, but name one ORIGINAL character of hers that could be box office? She rode the political impressions her whole SNL career and that was about it.
So funny
KATE BETTA NOT LEAVE! THE SHOW WOULD TANK!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
At least Cecily Strong isn't leaving. She's my favorite character.
Some of us grew up watching Kate. Can’t believe she’s leaving
Hate that she is leaving the show…
Natasha's southern accent could be a solid Chappelle impression
Writers are too scared..This could have been a lot funnier, not a copy of previous bits, with some unfortunate additions.
This was the most pathetically unfunny skit ever.
How disgusting has this show become.
Yeah no.. The Ryan Gosling is still the best one, imo.
I need Aidy...
More hair poking out the sides than a hipster beard in an N95 😂!
"Why clean the house if nobody's comin' over?" Gotta needlepoint that and hang it over my unmade bed. I will miss you Kate McKinnon (and all your SNL characters who made me snort liquid thru my nose)❣️
There needs to be a COVID Law for SNL. "NO Cast changes until COVID is officially OVER!" Losing Kate, Aidy, Kyle and Pete all at the same time!? Brutal!! They're ESSENTIAL WORKERS to our well being and ability to find something to laugh & smile about weekly!
I knew she would leave one day but dreaded it. What a great tribute to her best SNL cast member you made me laugh so long I would rewatch your skits when I was having a hard time thank you Kate you will be truly missed and forever loved!!!
Why clean the house when nobody's coming over?! Kate and Aidy will be missed!🤣🤣🤣
Started getting misty eyed around noon today about the cast. After that ending though, crying pretty dang hard.
That made me tear up
Wonderful send off!!
Kate made me truly enjoy SNL again. I will miss her greatly. Not since the late 90s/early 2000s stellar casts have I loved a cast member so much. She leaves unfillable shoes.
I feel like Aidy didn’t get a goodbye. Only Kate and Pete did.
Long live Kate McKinnon!! Brilliant comedian that makes the world better through making us LAUGH 😂 😂😂!!❤️
Please don’t let this be the final one I love these encounters
She’s actually leaving? 😭😭
Omg I’m so sad. I will miss her so much. 😞😆🥲
GD, the tears 😭
Damn, her crying on her final cold open… this episode is definitely gonna hurt.
As long as this is really the final one. The first one funny. Now I could write this the beats are exactly the same. They really could have deconstructed the sketch
Kate was holding back the tears at the end of one of my all time favorite skit series. I wish her nothing but the very best in her endeavors.
I never thought I would see Kate McKinnon leaving SNL. She left with a bang.
Ugh I was fine until she went up on the spaceship and turned around. Now I’m crying. Kate will be missed 😭😭
These skits have always been my favorites!😜😂
The Rule 34 of this sketch is gonna be epic.
So that's why Kate McKinnon is leaving SNL, now I understand. #LuckyLittleAliens
SNL defends their content rather aggressively. Anyone know if/where is posted the sketch McKinnon plays as a senior citizen being admonished for playing Monopoly, and throwing a wasps nest into a zumba class?
Kate McKinnon, you won't ever see this. But, thank you. Thank you for the laughs through good times and bad. Can't wait to see you in whatever you decide to do next.
She had an amazing run I live vicariously through her and I'll be crying at the end too 💕
Thank you Kate for all the laughs 🥺❤️
A blip at best.
She’s super talented. It was a teensy tiresome to watch her enter and hold for applause the last couple seasons rather than commit to the bit.
I will miss Aidy and Kate. Aidy was so good at doing the "Nervous" person, and Kate....well, so many characters
Awww! What a sweet and kickass goodbye.
This is a great skit and now it has the honor of being a cold open.
Thank you Kate! She’s carried the show for a decade!!
Why clean the house if nobody’s coming over, will be a line that will live in infamy. I was both laughing and crying throughout, Kate was one of the all time best. Her tearing up said everything. What a great sendoff
Go Kate!  Ya beautiful weirdo! ❤️❤️❤️
Kate McKinnon- phone home 👽 🛸
It must be so hard to keep a straight face around kate mckinnon.
I do believe we'll see this skit at least once again, as I am sure Kate will be hosting some day.
Thanks for the laughs, ladies!
Kate was the most talented cast member since Bill Hader
What's gonna happen now...I mean SNL is losing more than half of their impressions..
Gonna miss Kate so much! Know she’s gonna do great things and I can’t wait to see what’s next for her. Will definitely be remembered as one of the best SNL cast members of all time!
Never clicked on an SNL video so fast in my life. These videos are probably my favorite
Good-bye, Kate, and thanks for all the laughter!
I thought next season was gonna be her last
Wow, wasn't expecting to get emotional about Ms. Rafferty taking off 😢 👽🛸 Show's not gonna be the same without you Kate!!! 💔
Four members leaving, wow! They should just retool the show as The Keenan Thompson Comedy Hour, and a half...🤔
I remember when SNL was funny. Unfortunately that was a long time ago
They should've brought Ryan Gosling back for this!
❤️❤️❤️
Wow the emotion on her face as she waved goodbye. You’ve been our sweetheart in SNL thank you for such an amazing job Kate.
"That really rips my nips." Man, I'mma miss Kate. Also, kudos to Natasha for staying in character, though I'd expect nothing less. ❤   Aidy and Kate are really the dream team and I'm emotional. It hit me when Kate broke, "Live from New York it's Saturday Night." You could hear the emotion, and now I have feels.
I will miss Kate McKinnon, Aidy Bryant, and Kyle Mooney. Kate is a powerhouse, but I will miss the energy Aidy brought to sketches, like that lady with the brochures in 'Hotel Ad' sketch, and the awkwardness Kyle brings to so many of his characters.
Rafferty for Prez.
Kate McKinnon, I don't think SNL will ever be the same. The most amazing and hilarious characters have been done by Kate. Ugh I have no other words
I’m cryinggg 😭😭👽
the best ever ❤️
awesome!
this is my favorite snl skit everrrrr! kate and aidy are gonna be so sorely missed <3
"I've got more hair poking out the side than a hipster's bread stuffed into an N-95." Kate.
It's sad that 4 iconic SNL cast members are all leaving at the same time. It's going to be interesting to see who replaces them next season and if they are going to live up to these people. Season 47 was definitely a highlight for SNL
I'm gonna hate to lose that hog taker and log maker...rocking no pants here...
Ugh that ending got me 😭 you will be so missed, Kate!
Tears.
Love you, Kate x
Definitely a favorite character and SNL cast member!  Kates quiver at the end about broke me! 🥺 Kate McKinnon, Thank you!
Kate please don't leave SNL!!!!!!! 😢😭
It's a spaceship on a budget I wouldn't go, but she wouldn't know.
I feel personally attacked by her name being Colleen.  🤣
This was too funny. In tears.
Thank you Kate, Pete, Kyle and Aidy!!!
Gonna miss you Kate. Thank you for the laughs. And best of luck!
Good riddance. She’s over stayed her welcome
Oh no!  I love her so much!  She is so funny.  What an emotional exit this was....I know she will be doing great things.  I can't wait to see what is waiting for all of us from her
OMGAWD IM HERE SO EARLY
I knew Pete was leaving but aidy, Kate and Kyle too??? Wtf 😢
Why clean the house if nobody’s coming over , lmfao
No longer funny
We are going to miss you all, Kate, Aidy, Pete and Kyle
I'm not crying. You're crying 😭
Ugh this again
Kate,an icon with just one of her iconic characters,Mrs.Rafferty.Was touched at the end when she was obviously moved.I watched the whole thing,with my slime shooter and my methane tooter lol!
sobbing uncontrollably. kate is amazing, i look up to her and she inspires me so much. she brings me so much happiness and i am so sad to see her go. i hope she comes back to host in a few years
When Cecily leaves, you all can copy paste these comments! I just hope Kate is happy and content.
Already looking forward to her hosting a future show.  Can't wait!!
You can see it as soon as she turns around, it hits her that it's the final show in her long and well deserved run. Truly beautiful send-off
i cried the whole time. thank you, kate mckinnon, for all of the laughs. you have truly changed my life and i can't wait to see where life takes you next.
“My Dong hole and my wrong hole” will never not be funny!!😂😂🤣
Ahhhhh.  Bye Kate.  Luv ya.
So emotional
I would say you should be ashamed of yourselves, but i know you already are............WOWFFFF!!
😂I’ve got more hair coming out the sides than a hipsters beard stuffed into a N95 ☠️☠️☠️
We love you Kate! keep those aliens happy!
Agent Fitz Simmions is from Marvel Agents of Sheild. If anyone didn't notice that
Farewell Kate McKinnon You Will Be Missed. Losing You Is Like Losing Kristen Wigg. Thanks For Showing Us That It's Not Only Okay To Be Weird & Different, But It's Awesome! We All Love You!
Legend
7:19 I'm not crying, I'm not crying, damn.. my eyes are watering. We'll miss you Kate!
So many key words are flying here I don't know if I coming or going.
"That fortune teller was dead on." Kate is the best ever.
Gonna miss my fav lesbian 💙🥹
I swear...I feel so weird.  I remember Kate from the 2000s when she was on "The Big Gay Sketch Show".  She had this character, a 12 yr old posh and prim British boy who was transgender, called "Fitzwilliam".  He was dressed like a Victorian schoolboy and always on the look-out for a way to change his penis into a vagina.  She was hilarious. When I realized that chick was the same one tearing it up on SNL as Olga Povlotskyi, I was really happy.  I don't know what she is leaving the show for, but I hope what she does next brings a lot of success and that we'll be able to continue to enjoy her for years to come.
I just started watching snl this season, and seeing Kate McKinnon on every week doing hilarious impressions and just being herself helped get me through a really rough year. Whenever I was questioning my identity, which happened a lot this year, watching Kate on snl made me feel a bit better about myself. Kate, if you ever see this, just know that i’m eternally grateful for your existence and bringing joy into my life❤️🏳️‍🌈
Aww, gee thanks.....what a great laugh you gave me!!!  And--guess she'll be having a hard time for awhile with no cigarettes on Mars......Ha!
This was a great goodbye to one of the GOATs.
Someday I wanna see Kate as the funny side kick/ comic relief character in a marvel movie, I’m gonna miss seeing her on snl 🥲
I love Kate McKinnon! I love her in these skits!  From laughing my butt off then started crying because I didn't know she was leaving the show. She is one of the funniest people!  Love her and will miss her!
i was laughing and now im crying
My reaction when I thought I saw this clip  but find out it was uploaded 40mins ago 😮😍😂🥳
My heart is breaking - We will miss you Kate. That was a perfect good bye. Thank you for the laughs and best wishes.
Funny Af lol. Legend
Why clean the house if nobody's comin over 🤣
I hadn't realized how much I needed to hear the phrase "coot coot and prune shoot" again
Kate is my favorite
💜
"Agent FitzSimmons". WAS THAT AN "AGENTS OF S.H.I.E.L.D REFERENCE?!"
All hail Queen Kate!
I know I'm not the only one in tears right now😭😭😭
That "Chronicles with the Gray's" episode next season is going to be a doozie.
anyone else like they stole archer joke with "damn that fortune teller was dead on?"
Too dam funny 😄
Kate, the hero we all deserve
Kate is one of the best things happened to the Earth! She’s irreplaceable and be sorely missed.
I was laughing out loud while I realized it’s Kate’s goodbye skit. it ended up having me so emotional🥺 You’ll be missed Kate❤️
Yes! Yes! Yes! They don't make Colleen Rafferty skits very often. One of my favorites of Kate McKinnon. 😂😂❤️ Awe the last part though 😓. She got choked up. I will definitely continue to follow her with whatever she does. Just one of the greats now.
She is truly the best of the best! 🥰🥰🥰
KATE IS A LEGEND
Omg…….rolling with laughter, McKinnons experience would be mine.  How can anyone keep a straight face….
I can’t believe Kate is gone… I’m still processing it, processing that SNL might become remotely funnier going forward. Hope! Hope! HOOOPPPPEEE!
I have loved Kate since she was in The Big Gay Sketch Show and Mad Tv and now SNL. She will be greatly missed 😭
I laughed. I cried. Kate McKinnon is amazing and I’m sad to see her leave 😢❤
im going to miss kate on here she was amazing thank you kate (:
Kate has to host once a month! Please bring her back for as many cold opens as possible! Kate don't go!
Kate was a great part of SNL. She provided a lot of laughs to everyone, and she will be missed.
Kate McKinnon 😍
this is pure genius!😭 I'm happy they were sent off with a proper goodbye🥺♥️
I did not expect such an epic way out, thank you Kate
Goodbye Kate mckinnon we will miss you
What a way to send off a great character and a great performer all at once. Tho I do wonder who will play Hillary now.
No human-being should be put through a life with SNL, without Kate McKinnon 😢😢
Wow that got emotional REAL quick
The large woman seriously needs to lose some weight for health reasons.
Kate is really smoking 🤣
Ugh!!!  First time seeing Kate was her impression of Ellen!!  Dang it!!  I’m so sad!!
Thank you Kate, Aidy, Kyle, and Pete for all the laughs these last few years. We’ll miss y’all <3
I'm so glad I got to watch Kate live on SNL before she left!! Amazing comedian.
When is skates last day?
Absolutely LOVE these skits!!!! So funny!!
what a great send off for Kate ❤️
Final episode?!?!?!?!
"My dong hole, and my wrong hole."  BWA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!!
Um who is the guest chick? Idk her and she wasn't funny🙌🏾 this is a classic skit to be underdone by a bland unknown host🙄
Kate McKinnon is going to flop, like every other SNLer that leaves the show, she's awful on  SNL, & everything else she's been in, everything.
“I’ve got more hair poking out the sides than a hipster’s beard stuffed into an N95” 😆
So sad to lose Aidy, Kate, Pete and Kyle. Aidy is just the funniest. She’s the one you wanna be besties with. Kate’s comedy is on a whole extra level. She is my forever girl crush. Love Pete and Kyle too.
hahaha!! "Why clean the house if nobody's coming over." I watched a couple of the older videos just today. Wow! I just realized the ending. Kate will be missed.
Love you, Kate. So excited for everything you do next. Thank you for sharing your time with us.
Are you guys retiring this skit?!!!!
"That rips my nips" 😂
We're gonna miss you Kate, and Aidy!!! Come back soon to host please!! ✌🏾❤️
Losing a lot of good ones this year. Kate, Pete, Aidy, and Kyle.
#Pubicallyspeaking lmaoooo!!!
The perfect sendoff to one of the best performers SNL has ever had
Man it would have been great to have Jake come back for a brief cameo
Agent "Fitz Simmons"?  Is that a reference to Agents of SHIELD?  Love that show!  And I always ship Fitz & Simmons!
Why clean it out cuz no one's come over! O perfect!
The umpire stopped the game !  😂😂😂😂😂😂👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽
Nothing funny about Kate but let’s keep acting like she was the face of SNL instead of Cecily 🐸 ☕️
I'm satisfied that they put her character to rest in this way. She will go down as one of the best in snl history!
Thanks for all the laughs
Is anyone else seeing this right after RPDR? Jinkx did Natasha so well
I had no idea Kate was leaving! LOVE LOVE LOVE HER!
👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽😽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽
The writers have been watching gaia ads 😄
Exactly what I needed today
Damn whoever started cutting onions at the end...
Best of luck to your dong hole and your wrong hole, Kate. We'll miss you!
Wait, did she leave snl??? Im googling but nothing.. say it ain't so
Oh no, she’s leaving?
It’s nice when departing SNL cast members get a goodbye sketch
"Why clean the house when no one's coming over."  I am going to miss Kate McKinnon so much.
Who's going to play Hillary Clinton?
🐐 🐐🐐
Kate is leaving SNL I’m not ready for this terrible day
"Why clean the house if no one's coming over" LMAO
Kind of a really ballsy move to open the show with this one. I respect it.
This is low key heartbreaking 😢
"It was bedlam" Love it
<3<3<3<3
I hope de does original comedy from now on and no more reboots
It gets less and less funny.
i never thought that one of these skits would make me cry for real!! usually i just cry with laughter. Going to really miss kate so much. she has been my favourite cast member since she joined. this was a really nice send off though.
I ❤️ Kate! She’s hilarious. I’ll miss seeing her on SNL.
Thanks for the laughs Kate!!!
I cried.   G-D it.
Really was hoping they did one more of these before they left.
What an awesome way to end it. My favorite running sketch with my favorite female comedian in a awesome send off.
Thank you Kate. I’ll miss you and appreciate all the great memories.
Are they retiring this skit or is Kate leaving
I am SO going to miss Kate! She is so amazingly talented, she deserves to go for to even bigger and better things, but it will be a tremendous loss to SNL. Goodness knows I'm going to miss Aidy as well. I hope to see both in other shows or films very soon.
In that last shot, Kate Mckinnon looked a lot like Lauren Tewes, from the Love Boat.
Thought that was Miley Cyrus in the middle.
Beyond one of the best players ever seen! ❤️ I love you gal! ❤️
Kate McKinnon is going to be in "DC Leagues of Super-Pets" as the voice of Lulu and that opens in theaters on July 29th.
I will miss kate so much! she’s the reason my love of snl grew
Goodbye, Kate!! We’ll miss you. We weren’t worthy!! 💙
abortion is murder
KATE.....U WILL BE MISSED
I’m gonna miss her and Aidy immensely on SNL
Final encounter.😢😭
I teared up as soon as I realized it was a good bye sketch. Love Kate, definitely will miss her. And Aidy too!
So sad to see Kate go 😞
I'm so sad to see Kate and others leave 🥺...but off to bigger and better things Good Luck Kate ,Pete ,Aidey,and Kyle on your future endeavors🥳
The "That fortune teller was dead-on!" joke reminds me of the recurring "The gypsy woman was right!" gag on Archer.
Lmfao I needed this, thanx gal pals and Pentagon interrogators😅🤙🏽the noises all of it cootcoot and prune shute lmao
Fantastic sendoff
These skits WERE good...
That’s a GREAT SWAN SONG for that character. Hands down.
Ok. That made me cry. Really gonna miss the two gals & Ms. Rafferty. Love long & prosper.😥
I was NOT ready for that 😭
Yesssssssss... This was good!!!!
🥺❤️so proud of you<3
SNL’s official death.
HOF for sure. Cant wait for her to come back and host 5 shows for that exclusive club.
❤️ well that turned emotional and I wasn’t prepared…
Whoa, I can't believe Kate got wrote out. The last time that happened was for Bill Hader's Stefon. End of an era.  I hope, whenever Kenan leaves, we get one final What Up with That?
I feel early. And I’m not. Lol
This Show will never be the same without Kate, Aidy and Mooney. Like a Championship Team this show will need a few seasons to Recover.
I'm not crying. You're crying.
These are one of my favorite skits thank you so much I needed this laugh
Brilliant! I laughed out loud and haven’t done that in years.
Kate leaving but not without one more of her roles that makes all her fans fall on the floor laughing. Literally sad she leaving. "Why clean the house if nobodies coming over" omg hahahaha
I'm gonna miss Kate sooooo much
Gonna miss her
Kate McKinnon will go down as one of the best SNL cast members of all time
I feel like this one is just as good as the other nearly identically like it but Im not sure if it is going to be popular or not cuz its such a remake
Not many cast members get an on air send off. When Stefon and Seth got married, was one or both leaving the show?
I thought they were going to do an ET reference toward the end.
Re    Mi    Do    Do    So
I am legit crying you guys
KATE HAS LEFT DA BUILDING!!!! NO ONE HAS BEEN BETTER SINCE GILDA!!!! TIL WE MEET AGAIN,I HOPE U DON’T 4GOT US,COME BACK 2 JOIN DA 5 TIMES.  LOVE U!!!!
She's great, but I'll miss Aidey more...
Kaye and Cecilia have been great
Kate McKinnon is probably my favorite cast member ever. I hate that she's leaving. Wish you all the best, Kate!
The victim in this skit is the jumbotron!
Not the same without Ryan Gosling.
I'm gonna miss Kate and Aidy so much! they were without a doubt the funniest on the cast and had some great characters.
What is she going to do now? What typically happens to most former cast members? Not the break out ones, but the average ones? Producing? Writing?
BEEN A WHILE SINCE THEY OPENED THIS STRONG
My God, it's full of stars 🌟
I named my cat Kate McKinnon 4 years ago.
What a legend. What a run. Can’t wait to see what Kate does next.
Kate, i miss you already.
This is how you kill off a character. Kate is reaching the end of her time on SNL
Kate is such a Phenomenal Actor... Love Her!!! 💜💜💜
We will ALWAYS love you Kate! Thank you for all the laughs throughout the years 🥰 can't wait to see you living up retirement to the fullest hun!
That was so bittersweet:/
Farewell to a legend
Kenan remains untouchable lols
Omg only she could do that!
OMG... Kate 😭😭😭😭😭😭
The 1000th 👍
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏Kate Mammi!!! NOOOOOOOO❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞YOU ARE A QUEEN !!! I  MISS YOU👑🌟
Thanks for all the laughs and great roles.  GL whatever is next.
KATE 😭❤️ the ending/her send-off gave me goosebumps!
The government finally admitted Aliens are real and no one cares 😂
Gonna miss you.
Oh, Kate McKinnon!! 😍🥰😢What can we say but THANK YOU for the laughs. Thank you for embracing every character with a vengeance. We love you, and we hope to see you again as much as possible. KATE McKINNON RULES!!!👽🙋‍♀👽"The little grey aliens were already lined up to bat my knockers around. So I figured what the hell, might as well play the hits." 🤣😂👽👽👽👽👽
The N95 beard joke is totally underrated.
thank you for everything kate ♥️
Noooo, I didn't know until her face at the end then I got it.  Damn she's been amazing.
Instant classic! Kate's the best & will be missed.
Dong 🕳️ And wrong 🕳️
I miss kate mckinnon she was great in snl.
Hate to see her go, but I'm already looking forward to the future when she'll be back to host.  She's an awesome talent!
bittwersweet
It didn't hit me until the end. I will miss her but I'm happy she's moving on.
It's too bad Cecily chose to kill her baby years ago instead of doing the responsible thing and raising the child like a REAL mother would.. But if she were responsible, she wouldn't have needed an abortion to begin with.
Best closing cold opening last encounter ever. A great friggin hilarious character
Wonderwear
She will be missed!!!!!!!!!!
Aw, is this her last episode? 😢
Ok, Kate, we got the memo… she needs a razor already.
FINAL 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I love her so
One of my faves! Kate you will be missed on SNL
Already missing you!
I really appreciate this skit I just wish I was able act in this skit with Kate she is amazing
Joe Biden is great! It's so nice to have a real American president back in the White House instead of that Russian spy, Trump.
kate- thank you so much for everything you've done not only for the show but for so many people on a personal level. you've inspired me so much and it is hard for me to express in words how much you mean to me. you will go down in snl history as one of the best and I'm so glad I got into the show when I did so that I could have even a sliver of overlap with you. we're going to miss you. love you tons <3
Gonna miss her alien abduction interpretations, especially since the UFO testimonies are just now heating up the congressional meetings.. :)
We will miss you Kate!!!
Dong hole n wrong hole...oy
This brings back so much emotions so I can only imagine how hard this must have been for Kate and the rest of the crew. Kate's gonna go down as one of the greatest to be there in SNL.
i'm in tears....i'm going to miss kate on here so much.
One of the funniest people I have seen on TV... 😁
Take Michael Che not Kate !
I thought aliens only like to probe men
Whelp there goes another good season of SNL. All the funny ones are leaving. Now SNL is gonna be another cringe filled, boring af show with no viewership. It just like when Andy, Seth, Tina, Jason and Bobby left. Get ready for another dull season. 🤷‍♂️
Thank you SNL for giving her the send off she deserved.
"I barely had time to pull my wonder wear back up." "I'm sorry, your wonder wear?" "Yeah because if you saw them you'll wonder where they've been."  I can't I'm done! 💀
Oooooomggggggg this can't be happening! Love You Kate!!!
Wish that they brought back Bobby Moynihan for this skit. Kate can get him to break character like before.
"Why clean the house if no one's coming over?" - Kate, I think you gave me a new life motto.
Loves me some Kate. She's gonna be missed.
Wouldn’t ya just give like a million dollars for Mulder and Scully to get in on this?
Goosebumps all over my body. Kate McKinnon is an SNL legend and what a ride it’s been.
Aliens? All I saw was a GOAT.
Ya'll know she's not really leaving Earth, right?
"...why clean the house when no one is coming over?"  Lmao
Thanks for all the laughs Kate, you are one of my favorites.
"I'm Agent Morris and this is Agent Fitz-Simmons." I got that. I understood that reference.
guys i’m confused, is aidy also leaving or is that just a rumour?
FITZ SIMMONS ..... a writer definitely watched agents of shield !! 👍🏻👍🏻
Love her 💞
Just tears in my eyes. I will miss her so so much
God bless Kate for giving us so many laughs for 10 years. Here’s hoping her wackiness prospers 🥲
gonna miss kate so much
We’ll miss you Ms. Rafferty!! The aliens are lucky to have you 💖💖
meh..
What a way to go.
You know Kate McKinnon is just truly incredible comedian. Once she knows everyone else, including herself, are trying to stop from laughing, she goes right for the jugular!
Kate is always funny in this character sad to see her go
Is this her final season?
NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! 😭😭
2022 = Biden Depression  Famine, food riots, run on banks
An all time top 10 castmember. Job well done.
Got so emotional, Kate sent off one of her most iconic characters as she exits her final show. SNL will never be the same without her. Can't wait to see what she'll do next
It’s a conclusion to this multi season arc. Imma miss it so much omg
So where not going to talk about the aliens 👽
please bring back Angelo
I’m not ready for her to be gone. 😩
end of an era
"Why clean the house if nobodys coming over!" really gonna miss kate
Kate McKinnon is a Top 10 all-time cast member. Change my mind.
I am literally sobbing sm I haven’t cried this much in ages
How the panel manages to keep a straight face. 🤣
Ten years ago I was using SNL as a way to “escape” during a really bad relationship in college, and I was excited for the Sofia Vergara episode because I had just gotten into Modern Family. As soon as the Pantene ad sketch came on, I thought “ugh, new person, why is she staring at the camera like that?” Then the new person delivered a remarkable Penelope Cruz impersonation, and within a couple weeks I was pretty impressed.   I was sad to see her mental health decline the way it did the last two or three years, but it seems like she’s managed to get back on the upswing lately. It’ll be sad seeing her go, but fortunately for the first time in a while, there are incredible new cast members to keep things going.
Lord, please don’t let the writers mess up a classic skit!!!  🙏🏾
Wooooooooo!
Thanks for all the laughs, Ms. Rafferty.
My yeastie and my beastie
That is...the worst attempt at a southern accent I have ever heard. Why not just have her character come from New York? I mean, she might as well have "New Yorker" stamped on her forehead.
I so love Aidy blinking 1000 times every time Kate speaks
SNL won’t be the same without Kate, really going to miss her.
I’ve been waiting for this   One of my favorite sketches
Why clean the house if nobody's coming over. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Tell us it's your final show without telling us it's your final show
Kate you are one of the GOAT’s!!!!
Yo I just saw this live 1hour ago and got on my phone during a commercial and oh wait sorry it’s on again
Is she actually smoking 🚬🚭 a cigarette 😂? In the SNL studio.....
Wow you guys make me laugh every time
Hey everyone I've been working my but off so hard for YouTube for so long Im about to give up.
What an amazing skit honoring the absolute legend!! End of an era. Can't believe you are leaving Kate! For years watching SNL meant watching Kate Mckinnon do all sorts of crazy impersonations and skits from Justin Bieber to Ellen to Hillary Clinton to Rudy Gulliani...you will forever be missed you absolute Queen
Was thinking about this series last night. This is amazing.
So sad we're getting ready to lose so many of these talented cast members. Their last episode(as cast members).
I saw the word “final” and actually gasped
This is in my opinion the best SKIT OF ALL TIME!!! I am so glad they did a 3rd one.
Definitely a send off Kate deserves.
Miss Rafferty 👀🤣🤗👀
This is one of my favorite recurring skits. Gonna miss Kate.
Wonderwear 😂 😂 😂
Kate's final tour de force and they hold it together. Well done, rejoin the aliens, doll. We'll miss you :(
The end of an era. We will miss Kate ❤️
This is great. Glad they revisited this subject.
literally started crying when kate said “live from new york it’s saturday night” WE WILL MISS YALL SO MUCH
I recently come from discovering this will be Aidy‚ Kate‚ Kyle and Pete's final episode
Good bye Kate, Pete, Aidy, and Kyle! Thanks for all the good times and GL in all your future endeavors!
iconic.
Please don't use the word "final"! These sketches are my favorites!
My favorite skits!!!
Classic!
Kate just can’t break character
First
Never get tired of this sketch
One of the best skits ever
hiiiiiiii
These always made me laugh so hard!!
KATE MCKINNON. 100% one of the SNL greats :,)
I’m in shambles THEYRE LEAVING I CANT
The second I saw the word Pentagon I knew this wasn't gonna end one
😃 😊 😀
Kate McKinnon is a legend
Hit the liiiikkkkkkeeeee!
Wow it’s crazy to be the first born of millions watching it lol
Only good series left
Best SNL series EVER!
