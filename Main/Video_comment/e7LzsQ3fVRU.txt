Am I the only one that wants this guy to call the UCL final?
Emma's watching "So Good" on Morning Mixtape on Fuse - Emma
00:40 goal PAR 02:15 goal PAR 05:09 goal JUV
One month later, and this is still the best football PSG has played yet…and that’s saying something
5:25 McKennie is world class on those set pieces. Say what you will about American but we seem to rock set pieces. I don’t know if it’s the basketball influence of like blocking out or because we have black guys who can jump... I don’t know. We’re good at them though. It’s kept us in many a game.
Really no reason PSG shouldn’t win every game with that front 3. And it’s not as though the rest of the team isn’t world class.
The league has changed. Remember when Arsenal was at the bottom of the league. Now they are at the top of the league. 😂 😂
Is this the first time that psg and juventus play against each other
Ninjas in Paris 😂
Looked like messi doesn't pass
I meant Mbappe!
MVPs have been the best season of his career and he doesn’t even know when and does not appreciate it  .he never gonna be able To score as much as the scoring this year !  He plays with two attacking incredible midfielders With great vision and technique that can’t be Marked with one or two players, those incredible players Make the defenders commit and then they release incredible passes on empty space for him to do  one touch to score .  He doesn’t even understand that .  Next year Messi will be gone .
Messi is an assist god but man needs to be selfish
One of US scoring against PSG is crazy
When will french/african people get respect? In entertainment, the culture sees France as wack. French people have brought us from the ghetto to upper class black people. People say they are snobs but they history also. reply
Verati gets hit during celebration
Does anyone know the names of these commentators?
I only hit the like button because McKennie scored. lol.
Mckennieeee
4:20 of course asking Clint Dempsey, a Texan, if Wes, a Texan, can make a difference.🤣
PSG need to keep up momentum like they did in 1st half and they will be a champions league final contender for sure .
I'm not used to Ray Hudson calling Champions League games. (Let alone, Messi's UCL games) 😅
Perin had a good amount of saves👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Messi playing in a weak league with a weak team. I am waiting for your comment. 🚶🏼‍♂️ 🎠
PSG has a shitload of money and talented players - the fact that some of their players don't know how to pass the ball levels the playing field a bit.
I love how this channel doesn't spoil it by telling the score in the video title and just lets us see who wins by ourselves.
0:47 2:20
What a fcking pass from Neymar to Mbappe
Mbappe's miss at 50 mins is very similar to the miss that started beef between Neymar and Mbappe seasons ago
Juve needs a better defense
Watching this felt like watching a game of FIFA for some reason
If some of these players weren't selfish they could be so much better. Clear chance at the end to pass but he wants t to take it the whole way.
Top tier highlights.
I know it’s very early on and this is only the first UCL match but PSG look the best they ever have since Neymar joined the club. After under achieving last season it seems like Messi has made adjustments and adapted his game to play more as a true number 10 in order to get the best out the team. He looks more  focused on build up play and creating for Neymar, Mbappe, and others (he already has 6A/3G in only 7 matches).  Additionally, Neymar’s form  looks like prime 2012 Barca. He’s putting in the most effort I’ve seen out of him in a while. He’s scoring and assisting and he’s even sprinting to track back on defense to cover counter attacks 😂.    Add in players like Hakimi, Veratti, and company PSG is looking very formidable. I like that young kid Vitinha from Sporting as well. Notice how I haven’t even mentioned Mbappe either since his play speaks for itself (although I still think he needs to pass more and not be so selfish).   -I’m a Chelsea supporter but I think the UCL will come down to PSG, Bayern, and Man City. (And yes I suppose Real Madrid as well since you can never count them out in the competition). It should certainly be entertaining come the spring time and I’m looking forward to it!
Mbappe is the reason why they could win it all or lose it all lol. he had great moments and scores some amazing goals and then there’s moments when you just go “ wtf is he doing”  I like him but jesus his mistakes could cause them to get taken out earlier than they should in the champions league 😂
As soon as the GOAT is sub out, there is nothing to watch
Mbape is a great footballer, but sometimes he's selfish.
My fav team here was juve, but even I was like, wait a damn minute. If mbappe  just passed, we would have conceded way more goals. Like look at the 5 minute mark. Even neymar was look "look, im right here"
The most unselfish team in history!!
Red card for Kimbembe for elbowing Veratti
These two announcers are fcking clowns. Absolutely unbearable to listen to.
Say what you want about Mbappe but my god that first goal was incredible. A striker needs to have the confidence to shoot in those situations. The kids got some crazy talent.
I wish Juve still had their old logo...I just can't get used to this new one...And even though I don't know anyone in this team, I could still feel like they're my team if they had the logo...but they just feel like a totally different club...
If Mbappe and Neymar can just pass to each other unselfishly within the box they would both have so much more goals
Can we talk about how no one pressed Neymar
Loving the commentator’s energy but he’s gotta stop breathing down the mic
stupifyingly magnificent, but you didn't even see it. too busy bla bla bla , like it's a baseball game - play by play fellas, is where it's at.
2:18 That move and goal… He have good teacher around
People always complaining about selfish players while players themselves don’t feel the same way about their teammate. Y’all making drama where it’s not.
Childish player to be this game called SOCCER—Mbappe
IMO PSG is the best club team in the world rn
2:52
kimpembe, kimpembe, kimpembe kimpembe, comment il s appelle?
7:43 Ayoooo you good bruh????
I dislike this commentator so much.
10:56 if he would’ve passed it here it would’ve sealed the deal
Juv played better tbh
Blessings, John 3:16.  Jesus loves you.
Mbappe needed to pass to Neymar for a easy goal. Who cares if he’s on the hat trick if it’s better for the team to get a guaranteed goal. Neymar also assisted him just return the favor.  Ney and Messi are magic
Perfect game from Ramos and Neymar. Ramos gets a yellow and Neymar rolls around on the floor like he just got shot. Exactly what we've come to expect from these players, well done.
i hate that verratti took an elbow while celebrating mbappe's goal. but I appreciate his charisma and composure. such a gentleman and show of maturity and love for the game
I very much dislike mbappe as a player. How are you gonna not pass to a wide open Neymar, especially after Neymar had an insane assist to him for the first goal?
3:23 Oh yeah, big surprise you got a card, asshole.
veratti getting elbowed at 1min lmfaooooo
PSG look suspect against set-pieces and crosses TBH. Wonder how many big chances they've given up that way
Haha I love these announcers
Mbappe is such a selfish player
The selfishness of Mbappe is unreal. My God
PSG aint winning shit. Wasting Messi and Neymars talents
Mbappe's good but so annoying when he doesn't pass
Mbapee greedy
I've missed Ray Hudson's beautifully hyperbolic commentary
@10:56 why doesn't Neymar pass to #28 Soler... he's wide open in front of goal onsides lol
Would of been 3-1 but greed took over
Mbappe needs to get chewed out. Had a clear pass to ney to make it 3
1:05 lmao
We soccer fans got two generational player's in mpape and Holland cr7 and messi will be proud in this two lads...
Thankfully we can always count on some huge Donnarumma mistake.
Keane should have started.
Mbappe the selfish fish
Proves my damn point again and I won’t say names but if you cannot , cannot get comfortable , you have a whole squad who understands the game , why be selfish, .
Oooh, it's Ray Hudson in the commentary box. I wonder what the TTM will be. (Time To "Magisterial".) Turns out it's 1:15. Good job, Ray!
We're here for the highlights, but I'm so glad to hear the main man, Ray Hudson, on commentary!
Mbape needs to learn how to pass for an easy goal scoring opportunities
MAJESTRIAL ! ! ! Only Madman Ray Hudson sey dat.  Mi Bwoy still. Calculusof. Anthr Original 1 fr Ray. He di Best. Still Mbappe shd know U gt dem Gt away Ball, U Push Up so d Defender go hv 2 Foul U fr Bhind. Instant Penalty. Rem dat Bappe if U read dis.
mbappe needs to get checked by the coach
Donnarumma overrated asf
Mbappe man.. finishing is poor
People in the comments keep talking about the play at 5:02 and Mbappe should have passed but he had the angle .. it was the right decision.. no reason to cross the ball at that point ..too risky...
Mbappe is the best finisher in the game .. he is lethal .. wastes no time or movement when he strikes
Neymar still has some serious gems left in his career.
PSG is so selfish rn. Mbappe or Neymar has to go.
ray Hudson mom
so weird seeing messi off the bench
This PSG team really has the potential to be competing for everything but I dislike the amount of greediness at times.
Mbapee pass the ball I will hate playing with him
Keep saying Mbappe isn’t the best player in the world smh
Neymar looking like he got shot in the leg, the way he was screaming after that foul...
the "highlights" of subs coming on and off... are not highlights.
Counted atleast 2 easy goals that were missed because Mbappe is a selfish wanker. Messi and Neymar should just pretend he's not there...dude would explode on the field and cry in the locker room lol.
Neymar had number 28 and kept it and gave it to embappe. Is he kissing ass ? 🤦🏻 I don’t like Embappe I’ve never dislike anyone in football besides a dude who bit another dude. Won’t say his name. F him 😂
Suarez would’ve scored
When messi and neymar score this post would have make millions of viewers in 2 days. Both of them fans combine is really huge.
So happy to hear Ray Hudson gets to call Champions League. I been dreaming to hear him call these Champions League matches since I watched him call games in LaLiga. Now, dream come true!
The commentators lag in real life
Wait I thought Roy Hudson retired !
great to hear ray hudson's voice again XD
PSG will never win the UCL playing as selfishly as they do. It's so frustrating to watch them blow opportunities because of their inflated egos...
I hate these long extended highlights. Give me something short and sweet. 3 minutes max
so glad ray Hudson Is back😂🔥
chúc kênh thầy càng phát triển hơn nha <3
Just awful announcing
The commentary on Point. What champions league is all about
I promise you if Mbappe keeps playing so selfishly and not assist to Neymar like he does to him they will not win Champions League and they can kiss that trophy goodbye they could have easily finished this game but Mbappes decision making is selfish asfck .
i hope psg meets barca, also suarez wouldve scored that goal 7:00
Deserved win but that Locatelli chance was penalty on PSG
The second commentator sounds like he’s on the verge of orgasm anytime Messi, Mbappe or Neymar has the ball 🤣🤣🤣
imagine Haaland was getting fed by Neymar and Messi like that.
First half was amazing! No complains. Second half was a strong unacceptable performance from everyone. The mentality was wrong a second half without a clear mindset, terrible mistake again from Donnaruma smh pleaseee put Navas to the keeper, trust me we will get knocked out again if Donnaruma keeps making simple mistakes.
If PSG would play as a team they could win every match 5-0, but they all have big egos, except for Messi.
PSG team is in a big problem. Leo is a humble and matured. He showed the world that he is already his century best footballer as Mbappe is just a beginner. Let Psg Mbappe learn from Leo for greatness. This kid need to avoid his eggo that all the world can see. How come he even thinks to compete with Leo. Childish mind . Let alone Messi Mbappe is not close enough to neymar's achievement. A kid be humble and mature.Talent without these things makes you unrespected talented guy. This is my critical advice. peace
6:53 Wow this would've been an amazing team goal!!
American: scores in big UCL fixture Europeans: “should’ve scored two, terrible, clearly not ready for European football”
Running at that speed would had been hard to assist Neymar I would had been selfish
Please people know these new Messi fans are just the little kids who only watched his prime years on YouTube or only watched the end of it,that’s why they so insecure, they didn’t get to see Messi win 3 champions league by 23 years old. They only saw his last one..some of them even probably only watched it on YouTube highlights lmao so please don’t lump us all together..mbappe don’t make us all insecure like these 🤡
Doesnt matter in the end this is the same dysfunctional team that it has and will always be. Two clear goal opportunities wasted because mbappe and neymar are exclusive to who they pass the ball. They will never succeed against big teams.
kim didnt want verratti to celebrate apparently 1:06
Neymar and Mbappe are so selfish on the ball at times. Mbappe slices a shot on a break that he could've served on a platter to Neymar for an easy goal, then at the end of the video Neymar hangs on to the ball way too long and finally Plays a pass to Mbappe on the left late. Had he played a through ball to the player on his right it would've been another easy goal opportunity. But these players want to do it all themselves. It's why they'll never win the champions league with them.
Glad to hear Ray Hudson voice again. My favorite word " astonishing jaw dropping genius"😅
anyone else see kimpembe elbow verratti in the face lol
Juventus suck
Some of you will comment on the negative plays of these players. Some of you also never played in college or pros and it shows. These guys are running 5-10 miles a game, legs throbbing; mistakes are made. Killian is a killer, he's a striker that is taught to see only straight and finish. You can't can't be an artist and a killer.
COMMENTATORRRRRRRRR
The Day of judgement What will it be like? video https://youtu.be/ttviqvfTBTg
Poor Verratti at 1:07 😂
Felt good to see Mckennie punish the ball hogging Mbappe and Neymar
Even watching just highlights of a game Ray Hudson called is unbearable with him.
Lmao, at 1:07 Verratti got hit in the face by Kimpembe. The face he makes is hilarious. 🤣
call me a fanboy don't give 2 shits. 4 main points. That need to be fixed or this PSG has no chance of winning the champions league.  1 Mbappe needs to pass the ball more he's so selfish. his contract made his Ego Sky Rocket. the amount of power they gave him is ridiculous.  2 this system has Messi and Neymar always looking for Mbappe. like they have to, instead of playing freely, there are more restricted.   3 Messi is a playmaker in his best games he's played the false 9 Role he doesn't have the speed and stamina for a winger anymore. He scores more and assists more.  4-3-1-2 is the best formation for this team to work better.
I keep thinking donarumma sucks
I can't stand mbappe
@1:06 Kim accidentally hit his teammate in the face during the goal celebration   Funny reaction 😆
man Messi does not look happy on this team.i feel like he can't be him self in this formation.
Mbappe’s style of play is sooo selfish and not taking into consideration his teammates, this team could be so much better but he is so immature when it comes to collective play
I just can’t seem to get behind a player like Mbappe. Dude plays for himself and no one else. (Pass the fucking ball dude)
Verratti got elbowed in the first goal celebration 💪🤣🤣
Can we just appreciate ray Allen's commentary? This man needs to be on every champions league game!!!!
God mbappe is great but so selfish. I don’t like him
If psg don't win this champions.... it's rigged!!!
The commentary seems delayed, like mbappe would score a goal and they wouldn't comment on it until like 3 seconds later
Where’s NAVAS!
Navas is a way better goalie
Ray Hudson...goat
5:03 very selfish from Mbappe!!
Ramos is the best 👌 with the back kick
1:07 Verratti getting hit in the nose 😂😂😭
Mbappe is in the form of his life
👍👍👍👍😍
Why did CBS pick up these two beIN Sports hacks to do commentary?? Literally the two most annoying people. Was this what the masses were wanting? 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄😩😩😩😩😩
This was so competitive I love this game!!!!
Commentator does my head in, same everytime
wait how many subs do they get
Milenials partied the moon Germany from scratch
Please stop putting the scores in the thumbnail
when mbappe is going to lear how to work with the master?
Who are these announcers 🤦‍♂️
1:08 verrati😂
If mbappe pass more he score more easily
What a game..Ray Hudson is the best commentator ever and idc what anyone says
As amazing as Mbappe was today--just as he has been so far this season--it does feel like one these (5:00) moments is going to cost PSG at some spoint, especially against the best in Europe where you get punished almost inevitably if you don't convert your chances: Mahrez not passing the ball in the 1st leg of UCL semis comes to mind. Hopefully, he realizes sooner rather than later.
damn, what a shame for Messi...☹️
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.   We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him.  We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell.

Mbappe = selfish
Brazilians have been known to bend light 😁
Mbappe gotta pass that to Neymar
Who is kylian mbappe i know mbmoney
Anyone know why they substituted someone in for Messi, Mbappe literally missed 2 easy goals???
Terrible announcers
Forza psh
Hey guys! Here's my take on the game. Bummed but still hopeful. Fino alla fine!  https://youtu.be/2Q0J99YJSF4
I'm sorry they should have let mbappe go and signed ronaldo he has a big ego and he never finishes and doesn't look for the right play only right play for himself, ronaldo messi neymar would have clicked much better
Been 2 years and paramount+ still isn't on PS5. Guess I'm stuck watching 8 minute highlight reels for the greatest competition in the world. Thanks CBS for your part in killing the beautiful game.
AYYYYYEEEEEE!! What A Game 🔥🔥🔥I’m trying to get my subscribers up too💯keep it up❤
God I hate that cbs gets champions league coverage
Voice cracks like a teenage boy,  Moans and screams like a teenage girl  Despite being an old ass Scottish guy,  Thinks he's a wordsmith but his choice of words are terrible, uses the wrong/unnecessary/hyperbolic/completely unrelated adjectives to describe things,  Deters people from understanding what he actually meant,  Overuses the word "magic" Stalks Messi wherever he goes like a pro criminal,  Overly familiar with him as if they're buddies,  Sticks to him like the flu,  Plagues my entertainment. Freakin Ray Hudson man  just from this highlight reel alone: "Stupefyingly magnificent!" "Magesterial pass"  "Drops a pint of beer into a shot glass at the other end of the bar" "Again, the calculus of football's equations solved, innit?" (as a STEM person, WTF?? Cringe) "went a different way, a primerose way(wtf?), and that's Hakimi" "especially with the type of jackrabbits, greyhounds, waiting for the ball" "it's a train at the station" "this game has tightened up like a vice, now" "if they can keep this 3-headed monster in slumber land" I can't take 90 minutes of this crap.  SERIOUSLY! USE. NORMAL. WORDS. AND. REGULAR. FOOTBALLING. TERMS. PLEASE.
PSG overrated. French ligue is easy
Mbape very selfish
Mbapee never passes the ball when it matters. Mbapee always wants to be the hero of the team. He cares about scoring goals, but he fails on clear chances to score when he could have pass the ball to Ney or Messi for an easier goal. And the truth is that if Mbapee still wants to be a hero, he will go to bed and cost us in the long run in quarterfinals or in the round of 16. right
Mbappe is so good yet soo tunnel focused that sometimes you want to slap him!
Neymar is on a different level right now. His play making and chances he is creating for not just himself, but everyone, is going to make them even more deadly than they already are. His CAM positioning is 🔥
Anyone see Kim elbow veratti
Veratti has been one of the best midfielders for the last 5 years change my mind
PSG build up attack certainly looks much deadlier but they put so many numbers forward that their defense looks very weak a top 3 team but I don’t see them winning this year
Neymar went back into his bag this season
Mbappe is overrated
How do you choose your beliefs, dreams, desires, or even favorite color?? 🔴🟥
2nd half was basically trying to get mbappe a hat trick, they could of scored more goals
Anyone else see kimpembe elbow veratti in the face at the beginning 😂
Who’s that amateur in Juventus goal?
PSG is pretty.. but Juve is one of those teams that never sucks.. ever.. ye olde skool..
Neymar was open by a mile and the French fry didn’t pass the ball …  To many superstars who are selfish and lack of team work …  Defense for psg is suspicious… Can’t make a team of superstars … Sad but they will go out when competition gets harder … semi - finals … To many chiefs
5:02 is the reason why Mbappe wont be the GOAT of this era
We need to play navas in the champions league donarumma is going to cost us with these kind of mistakes🤦‍♂️
Ramos clearings are horrible.
I'm so sick and tired of just hearing " MNM " CAN WE PLEASE PLAY AS A TEAM.  There will definitely be better chances for goals, assist and trophies. IF we played the ball to our other world class players on PSG.
What pisses me off more is Neymar and mbappe just looking for each other in the match, completely ignoring every other player with a way better chance towards goal. Neymar could've sent a perfect run for marquihnos but chose to look for mbappe with no space or chance for run. I'm sorry but psg will not win no trophies playing like this.
The way I see it, Mbappe is trying to be the hero all the time and Messi don't give a crap, he is saving himself for the world cup.
Ray Hudson voice
It seems 2 out of 3 PSG front men wants to win the Champions, the other, only cares about its personal record.
Is that ray Hudson😢
1:06 Verratti gets elbowed in the face
poor PSG they will never get a taste of the OREJONA
5:03 wow! Beyond selfish.
why do you show all the substitutions? not important to see most of the time
I think Juventus is the only team in the world still playing with 2 out and out strikers.
Anyone noticed Kimpembe elbowing Verati at 1:07 ?  🤣🤣
Psg will get knocked out later into the tournament lol! Poor fans getting their hopes up lol
PSG had a chance to score but missed it.. “If you don’t score you concede”. That’s what happens and it’s simple as that
RIP Juventus, we're no longer a top European club.
Neymar has no power, all his kicks are so soft.
1:06 😂 😂 😂
Verati hit by kinpembe
90 Percent of the mbappe haters have a Spanish name.😤🤔 You racist bums.
veratti getting hit in the nose 😭
Weston Mckennie 🇺🇸🇺🇸😏😏
Where have u been Roy hudson?
I mean Juventus is a terrible team these days. They really fell off.
4:57 Mbappe has gotta chill mann. hes good, but hes gotta fucking pass in moments like these. kid is too full of himself.
Y’all be hating on mbappe but this guy just wanna shine now that it’s his turn . Neymar and Messi had their time now it’s his time !!!! Leave him alone
1:07 Verrati 😂😂😂
Tuchel perd son job
Ray hudson commentaries never get old
I love Mbappe but I hate when he supposed to pass the ball and he doesn't pass it.
We need ray in the champions league final
Donnaruma is back in his prime
The only time I seriously look at PSG is at the quarter finals.
how do u miss open shots like that mbabe
b Make is a fool
Mbappe is getting more and more selfish
Ici c est Paris 😅😅😅
Hala Madrid
6:58 That Neymar pass was damn nice!
Mbappe is one selfish player. He should have lay the pass for a 3rd goal.
Pessi should stop shooting
Messi and Neymar are still such a joy to watch, the way they pass and create opportunities for their teammates, it's incredible 👏🏻
Mbappe is very greedy, it would have been 3-1 if he just passed the ball to Neymar.
This Champion League will be surprised back
PSG kings of the dive... funny cause several of the dives could've resulted in top plays if they weren't a bunch of weak sauce pretenders. Neymar has ruined this team.
When it comes to Mbappe people only want to focus on the negative he didn’t pass the ball one time & everyone saying selfish what about the goals he scored? Why do you always look for the bad in him are you jealous of him or something?
Mpabbe is such an L
Mbappe scores.. majesterial player.. Any USMNT player... and the American scores.. What's the big deal? Is it that they are shocked they play in Europe or are they trying to hype them up more than they are??
My god donnaruma is so overrated bro
this was a juventus team without their main players like di maria, chiesa, and pogba who making difference in such a game like this, against one of the talented expensive squads in Europe, it's disappointing they couldn't get something from this game, FORZA JUVENTUS TURIN
PSG sucks and it’s all mbappe fault
This game shows that PSG have a lot of problems. This type of play wont pass in a competitive game. Mbappe wanting to be the star of the show. He will ruin many chances. Fragile defence as always.  If your defense is not solid, you can't go win the champions league.
They are ordinary. Madrid, City, Bayern and Barca will batter this PSG. Their problem is still the same. Old bellends, no chemistry in front 3 and less work rate from that front 3. That's where the other tops are so much better. Lets not even talk about midfield and defense.
Hi @CBS Sports Golazo,  At the start of the highlights, when you show the squad, the space on your left is for the substitutes. Not the first 11. Thank you!
Carlos Soler to PSG? What the f- ?  Second rate team PSG buying best player of legendary team Valencia ??? All because sponsors of ISIS have all the money ? I want to throw up every time I watch this game. I used to be passionate about it. Club football sucks.
Mbappe doesn't have a pass button
Unstoppable when you can hit those volley and half volleys first time. You cannot defend it. Those first 2 goals.  But PSG will choke sometime down the road.
WHAT DO THEY SEE IN DONARUMMA ! BRING ON KEYLOR!!
We have ray Hudson commentating UCL matches now? 🔥
Great win by Psg Mbappé is definitely one of the best strikers in the world happy to see the champions league back.
UCL
Does Mbappe EVER pass a ball?
PSG would be unstoppable if their front 3 would learn how to press when they’re off the ball
Mbappe = tapinaldo, Penaldo, coronaldo. Both selfish trash players no team work. When mbappe isnt there look how great Ney and messi play he shudda just left to madrid so PSG could destroy him then he can go cry like ronaldo his idol. Of course hes fast and wants to get hatricks but dont bring down the team for your own gain. Its all about momentum. He kills the momentum trying to score all the goals. U think messi and ney are happy? You think they dont get affected by that? Idiots.
PSG is the most selfish team on the planet 😂 everyone is playing for themselves
psg shoulda scored more.
PSG first half was a 3-peat level team. PSG second half might not make it out of groups.
Mbappe will be the reason they get out, mark my words… I can tell Messi doesnt even waste his time trying to teach him humbleness
Mbappé is so selfish… 🤦🏿‍♂️
Haven't heard the word "magisterial" in a while from Ray Hudson. Gotta love it!!
If psg wants to win the champions league mbappe has to play unselfish football just like Messi and Neymar
1:06 poor Veratti got hit lmao
The commentator is the real mvp
1:05 Verratti hit by Kimpembe's elbow lol
So the black magic only working against pogba himself as he about to miss the World Cup 😂😂😂
it could have ended, 6-2
Mbappe is quite selfish and it's going to be a problem when PSG don't capitalize because of that
Powerful PSG! Brilliant Mbappé
Mpaype need to pass the ball to messi
Messi best player in the world
Does anyone else think the commentary audio is behind ?
Mbappe wanted his hat trick 🤣
Yoo roy doing commentating for Messi again 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽🔥🔥🔥
You are so small  CBS ....that's what happens when you don't give a shit about this sport....no TV games... petty
PSG could’ve had more goals if Mbappe and Neymar weren’t so selfish at times.
Damn pogba leave united for Juventus that look like they will struggle too
Wow!  At 4:59, if you've played before, you'll realize how crazy selfish Mbappe was there.  Mbappe knew someone was going to cut in front of the goal but he wanted the hat-trick.  I would be so mad if I was Neymar.
Fun fact: Moise Keane plays for both Juventus and Everton at the same time
Do not match , PSG is the champion and Mubbape is the MVP.
Mabappe the most selfish player i ever seen 👍 what a pos 😑
so glad ray hudson is comentating
The Cameroon/Algerian French boy,,,.. still too selfish to share the ball when a better opportunity appears,..F..K PSG.!
I really don't like Mbappe, even though he got two goals, so selfish and wasted lots of opportunities. He is a good player, that is it all.
Madrid all the way
I’m happy Ray Hudson was the commentator. He’s the best one
Sound is not in sync…
Messi being playing like he’s done with. #7 humble yourself dude.
Despite psg winning I doubt they will make it to the final.
Both Paris goals were UNREAL
Incredible performance by Neymar  Mbappe and Hakimi - solid game by Veratti and Messi.. but have grown to expect more from both ..  obv Mbappe should have found his bro... But he also scored two SCREAMERS
Puro niñote en el psg
Here to just watch how Messi react
Just the way this game played out it tells you PSG is destined for another knockout exit. Neymar needs to leave. Messi just wants playing time and staying in shape for the World Cup.
This couldve ended in a 5-1 only if mbappe didn't miss those clearly potential goals and wasn't selfish and pass it the ball, didn't he learn from last champions? cant miss those opportunities
If Neymar could’ve passed that ball to Carlos instead of Mbappé 😩
Can you guys stop spoiling the results with the thumbnail picture?
Messi shots in this champions league 2 cr7 0
Wonder if CBS will EVER get the audio sync right
Brooo the second commentator was having an orgasm
Can the commentary be anymore bias towards psg?
"Brazillians have been known to bend right"?!?!?! Yooooooo chilllllll
the commentary tho 😩
5:03 I swear this turtle is so F*cking selfish
Glad Ray is back
10:48 what a brilliant save 🙌🏾
The difference between Halaand and mbappe is halaand gives others a change to score if it’s needed. Mbappe seems like he just wants all the glory.
Psg is a scary team. If they put all that quality and technic together, they can destroy any team offensively
Can’t stop laughing at the classic elbow and disappointment on Veratti’s face 😂
I can not stand Mbappe anymore.
Two of the worst commentators in the world, wish I could mute them 🤦‍♂️
Mbappe is so damn selfish... jesus christ
Everytime I watch psg I feel like they play as if they don’t care or aren’t trying as much as they could. It’s kind of frustrating.
L to all the little kids who say Neymar is finished/isn’t or was never world class🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
Wait RAY HUDSON IS COMMENTATING THE UCL??? I NEED THAT PARAMOUNT+
Gimme city -psg Final
There it is ... "MAJESTERIAL!!!"
Mbappe is overrated lol 😂 but at min 5:05 he should have passed to Neymar
4:58 disgraceful from mba
Rainbow pass and here is your pot of gold 🔥🔥 mls commentators could never 😂
Veratti getting elbowed in the face when they’re celebrating Mbappes first goal 😂😂😂
Mapped is soooooo talented, but he has to pass that to Neymar next time. Got to take advantage of that opportunity.
I love how they finally got Ray Hudson to commentate Champions League
Kilian never pass, psg never gonna win
that is SEXY football from PSG
Everyone talks about the Messi Ronaldo Era but what about this announcer. Mans been saying magisterial this whole time show him some love
Yoooo FCK MBAPPE ! What’s he mad about ??? Him And ines rau putting up his butt ??? Neymar was WIDE OPEN and the mofo didn’t pass it SMFH
Thank you for coming back ray Hudson. We needed you
Bro I am a Real Madrid fan but I still feel Mbappe is a fucking beast. Gotta respect him man those two finishes were fuckimg amazing. And that assist from neymar oof
Veratti got hit during the first celebration 😂😭
That was a good game. Could have ended 4-4 if not for those goalkeepers!
I wish if bappe wasn’t such a selfish player it shows he still have a lot more to learn having composure to finish or assist some times
What happened at 3:19??
Those neck tattoos look lame AF on Ramos
Another Round of 16 elimination for Juve
Messi look not happy at psg!
Please cbs, never ever have that dipshit scot or Irish commentator ever on again. He has been ruining bein games for years now. I actually couldnt watch this game due to that guys unwarranted commentary. I’d rather listen to the American boring guy and the crowd than the United Kingdom guy.
Am fell like PSG is gonna win the champion League
Juventus is missing their 3 best players too! Not a good look for PSG. POGBA, CHIESA, and DI MARIA
1:07 That's gotta hurt.
Messi is gonna assist him self to another cl title
Love to hear Ray Hudson on champions league games
Allegri needs to be fired ASAP. He really went with a 3-5-2 formation against the best attacking team in Europe. Not to mention he didn’t play di Maria at all. But decides to start Milik ?? Come on man get this coach outta here
I’ve only been watching epl until this match…it’s crazy how much time on the ball they let each other have…also the amount of times mendes and Hakimi had acres of space on the wings and nobody passed to them…psg should’ve won by so much more
Sad how haaland is taking the spotlight just because mbappe is with PSG, biggest mistake of his life not going to madrid
can Weston McKennie make a difference? well yes but not a big enough difference lol
Mpabe is selfish he should passed the ball the Neymar….he need to respect the game like Benzema always said
10:45 Kean didn't pass that ball and he caused Juve to lost 3 points 😔
The real winner in this match is the announcer, Ray Hudson! What a Legend
Mpaypal is the most selfish mf on the pitch.
Words cannot express how happy I am to hear Ray Hudson commentate over Messi again🙌🙌🙌
They need better trust among their forwards. Everyone can feed Mbappe but Mbappe gotta feed others than its GG. Donnaruma always complaining aahha
Kimp bumped Marco out of the celebration, gave him a back elbow to the nose, then kept hopping around like he didn't feel nothing and it was all good. Lol.
Mbappe good but  selfish AF
We can't shake these nerds from commentating PSG games. c'est la vie
The worst highlight ever. Who’s highlighting the matches this year?????
Idc that mbappe scored twice pass the damn ball he only got those goals cause he was set up nice he wouldn’t of got them himself in my opinion
Someone gotta tell Mbappe to be less selfish. He is so selfish! this much should be 3-1 because Neymar was in position to score but selfish Mbappe chose not to pass the ball to Neymar.  Also, nowadays, nobody cares about Messi anymore. Messi was replaced. This is something that would never happen in Barcelona. Poor Messi! He used to be the boss in Barcelona now at PSG, Messi is a  bartender or server
Yoooo Ray Hudson doing champions league
Only one shot to Donaruma and gooolllll! What a cheat this goalkeeper!!!
God I love Ray Hudson.
Mbappé is so selfish. Has 2 goals already and doesn't set up Neymar with a tap in
Neymar not passing on the last counter attack is shameful. Great skill but not top level decision making.
Selfish mpambee
is it just me or is the audio really badly desynced?
I missed his commentary
Why he is so selfish is bcz he trying to score gold to see if he can win  dor
5:01 is why PSG can not win the Champions League. Mbappe should’ve passed the ball to Neymar…
The worst most annoying commentator I’ve ever heard
Mbappe is a sucker, not a team player. its amazing that he did not sign for Real Madrid
MB is a poor player. I wouldn’t want to play with a guy like that. It doesn’t seem fun
1:07 elbow in the face 😈
Kimpembe elbowing Verratti in the face should have been a send off 🤣
Why’s no one talking about that goal and pass by Neymar
psg is literally playing fifa irl 💀
Mbappe needs to pass to Neymar. Other than that love the dude!
Messi is a passenger
“Kneemar”
Such a selfish play from mbappe in the 51th min 🤦‍♂️
Wish Peter dury would’ve commented this one
Game could easily been 5-3
I'm French and I hate PSG with all my heart
why did kimpembe elbow veratti
I have a shirt sign by mbappe who really wants it
IF CBS SEES THIS PLEASE KNOW WE NEED RAY HUDSON
FOOTBALL NEEDS RAY HUDSON
PLEASE KEEP RAY HUDSON ON
RAY HUDSON THE GREATEST COMMENTATOR EVER
The future is Mbappe vs Haaland the way it was Ronaldo or Messi. But Neymar is playing insane football right now
Lmao he got elbowed hard
y'all could hate on mbappe all you want but he's the best in the world right now.
this commentary is too much
At 1:05 vartatti should get a foul for that
Is beyond me how this goalie took out Navas, this has to be due to Navas nationality, i have no other explanation… the goalie is below average at best.
You can say what you want about mbappe but you have to admit he is an all around complete striker
Champions League football is back!!! The best!
Not gonna lie...after Mbappe didn't square the ball for Neymar I hoped Juve would get a draw... If Mbappe had half the team play as Luis Suarez then PSG would be unplayable :')
PSG never gonna win 🏆 as long as that selfish mbappe is there.
I hate that Mbappe doesn’t pass. I would never want him on my starting eleven. He could’ve back passed to Messi for an easy third goal. No vision except for tunnel.
Ronaldo or Messi would have sealed those opportunities missed by Mbappe in their prime 😪
Psg is a good squad but they still playing selfish the coach gotta be more serious with him Mbappe gotta pass the the ball more in the box to capitalize on every single chance because if you run into a team like Man City wit Pep being the coach they’re gonna punish you they don’t have skills in Man city but they’re very technical because that’s how Pep trained em to be so come on Psg good game but plz tighten up if your angle in the 18yrd box look for your teammate
Mbappe is so selfish and clearly shows that he can’t be a Messi and Ronaldo at all!
I wish one Mbbape and Klopp get together.  That would be magic.
1:05 verrati😭😂
Mbappe’s selfishness is what’s gone cost them the champions league to city.
I hope ray Hudson’s in fifa 23
That commentator man… he loves to slurp it doesn’t he?
"Rainbow pass, and there's your pot of gold."  Ray Hudson is the best. I've missed him.
Love hearing Ray Hudson
Verarti☠️
Is it me or does everyone just have to pass the ball to coach manager player mbappe 🤣
Not Allegri parking the bus at 2-1 down 😭😭
So nice to have ray Hudson back!!
Great pass from Mbappe @ 5:00 /s
5:03 dickhead man😂
PSG will win nothing because of selfish neymar and mbabpe. I am not talking about the goal and the assist they made but the other chances they missed. The score easily could have been 3-1 or more
Juventus has good team he should have tie or won
Mbappe is only big in Paris! 😂
I’m surprised of the score line tbh I thought juve were going to get destroyed but they held up nicely defensively especially with Perin and had chances but got unlucky in the second half
Verrati ate that elbow at 1:07
If psg continue like this they will not make it to the final. To many selfish games they played.
Verratti is exceptional
I'm glad to hear Ray Hudson back again for commentary for the champions league 👏
1:05 veratti gets elbowed in the face during the celebration 🤣
Verratti with a celebratory elbow to the face!
Juventus is Not a good test for Juventus . Psg looked shaky and vulnerable .
Stupid mbappa  won’t pass the ball ⚽️. Childish manager
Good game by Mbappe, if only his ego could let him pass the ball more. I Guess he wants ballon d'or, well he needs to be a complete package, Selfishness isn't part of it .
The elbow on veratti 😂😂on the celebration
What a pass by Neymar 🔥🔥🔥🔥
😂😂😂😂😂 ITS INTERESTING TO SEE MESSI FANBOYS CRY ABOUT MBAPPE(NEXT CRISTIANO)🐐🐐
PSG is in exploring stage. The coach is being more conservative and making  Neymar and Messi more like box players for now... But Neymar and Messi are not system players.. like the ones you find in EPL. It takes time for the coach to adjust his tactics and find the best way to utilize   these 2 very special person.
I missed ray hudson man :(
Neymar is just insane.
Facts : Mbappe scores faster than his shadow
Kimbempe should be a mma fighter with those Elbows
Mbappe is one of the more selfish players I have seen, he will never win a champions league if he tries to shoot everything instead of pass
So good to hear Hudson’s voice on commentary again. I didn’t realize he is with Paramount now! Mbappe 👑
Gotta love these commentators!
Mbappe only cares about himself and ONLY is all friendly to his teammates when he gets what he wants. Trash attitude of a player, hope it doesn’t get him nowhere.
Mbappe needs to be slapped. Neymar was open and if they get lose in the group stages then it’s ALL Mbappes fault for being super selfish
Mbappe need to learn to pass the ball
Fk MBAPPE bruh he so blinded by his ego
Why do they have these horrible commentators for the champions ???
These Messi fangirls are actually toxic smh. Can't believe you clowns actually call yourselves "Fans" of this sport. PSG could win 10-0 & If Mbappe scores 5 of those, you Messi fangirls will still blame him for not winning 20-0... actually ridiculous.
Ray Hudson came for Messi. Too bad Messi is no longer Messi....
Mbape selfish bastard
There are players who care more about winning trophies than personal achievement (which comes along with winning) and then there's Mbappe
Los narradores valen brga
@9:34. Messi wriggled and tiptoes his way to the bench😂😂😂😂🤣🤣
I was only excited because Ray was on the mic for Messi.
Mbappe is so fucking egoistic🤦🏻‍♂️
Mbappe vs Haaland will be the new Ronaldo vs Messi
I thought Neymar’s pass was more impressive than the goal
Anybody see Veratti ? 🤣🤣 1:06
Piemonte calcio were lucky not to be 6 goals down. And were unlucky not to have 2 or 3 more. 9:00 can someone explain what happens to mukiele just ball watching?
Donnarumma 😂😂😂😂😂
If Messi and Newmar leaves next season, mbapee won't be scoring these easy goals
Qual problema mbappé tem com neymar ? Ey vi q ta ignorando ney
Surprised the coach sent hakimi and Messi to bench in a sensitive time of the game .. not disrespecting psg bench .. but weird change.
Mbappé is the best incarnation of selfishness in modern soccer ⚽️
Love Ray Hudson’s commentary. Makes it better
5:03 Mbappe had neymar open I hate mbappe meanwhile Neymar does everything for psg like that beauty of a pass for the opener goal.
PSG spends more time on the ground than they do trying to score.
1:06 red card right there🤣🤣🤣
Yesssss ray Hudson is back
Mbappe is such a selfish player he gets great passes by neymar and he cant give him a easy goal mid video
Brooo Mbappe needs to f****** pass😂
Mbappé keep igniting Messi runs man 😣
Mbappe don't pass when he needs to.
I don't care the commentary here is very good almost epic  0:53
Mbapee is a very selfish player and if he don’t get is act together psg will not go far in the champions league cuz of him
BROOOO the way my wife makes me sound when we make love and I’m finishing 5:02 & 5:05 LOL!!! 😂
Even the Juve is not on its top, i tought they will win this match.
Is the sound delay irking anybody else off?
Everyone too busy criticizing mbappe which they should but nobody talking about how that new psg coach is giving amazing results with MNM? 🤯
Why is everyone focusing on mbappe not passing the ball he scored the 2 goals who made them win 😒
great commentary duo
Mbappe is so disgusting to watch no matter how many goals he scores he is too selfish man, he will blow a lot chances while he could just pass to someone to easily score as they do to him
Que egoista ney con solar, ahi tenia el 3-1 Seguro, y no la paso. 😒🤷‍♂️
1:41 never seen ramos get bodied like that on a header before 💀
Something tells me PSG is Nothing.
1:08 peep veratti getting elbowed by kimpembe lmao. also i love how everyone says vamos when they score like they’re all native spanish speakers 😂
Mbappe selfish af
Haaland better than mbappe
Bamoooooooooooooo
Get that American dude off the commentary bench. Its so dang cringe.
Selfish from mbappe at 5:04 could’ve easily squared it to neymar, despite the win this is why they’ll never win a champions league neymar and mbappe both have huge egos they’d rather go for goal than to pass the ball
They don’t show the fouls but they show random yellow cards and substitutions no one cares about
Neymar could have score 2 goals easy if Mpape pass it
5:00 how selfish can you be?😐
Idc mbapee is selfish af
wow mbappe is selfish. but an amazing talent he is. he needs to get rid of his ego but largely stay the same
Is a blessing and a curse when Mbappe scores early or God forgot he scores two before half time, he will want to take every chance I can almost guarantee he misses at least one assist to Neymar per game. His assists are like Ronaldo’s assists, not out of creation and build up but mostly out of flank runs and walls. But we’ll enough this team has more than enough creation with Neymar and Messi so they can afford to have a striker that wants it all plus he is clinical. Hopefully they’ll win the UCL this year.
@ 5:00 same exact play as Madrid. Except Madrid scored theirs. 😂 damn Mbappe!!!!
Exelente game from top the best 👌
I wasn’t aware y’all had the GOAT of all commentators.
PSG was doing pretty well the first half but they almost always fail to maintain consistency when they return for the second half.
I think PSG didn't have luck in the past, but I think finally they may have found the right coach to led the French Galacticos team as Real Madrid dream team of the past. Olympique de marseille is the only team in France which won a champions league, and given the way PSG has been playing over time they deserve to win a champions league and Fifa Club World Cup perhaps too in 2023.
I watched this game today and Messi is a shadow of a player he used to be. It's like he doesn't even want the ball anymore, the amount of times the ball was passed to him and he just passed it to the nearest player to him as quickly as he could.
That neymar dive was class 🤣🤣
Ray Hudson?!
Kind of a sad end to Messi career
Imagine you have NEYMAR, MESSI, MBAPPE but you struggling to win a game. 🙄
I'm a PSG fan and I honest want Mbappe gone. He was better when he was younger but his ego got bigger and the best of him and it will certainly be a detriment to the club success in Europe. Anyone would've passed that ball to Neymar if they were truly humble and wants the team as a whole to win. Mbappes wants to win but at the same time have his own personal glory. Football is a team sport, I hate Ronaldo in the past be he wasn't even nearly as selfish as Mbappe is on the pitch, what pisses me of is he is directly preventing Neymar, Messi etc from increasing their own number that they rightly deserve so when their are in positions to score. The only reason Mbappe is the only player on the PSG score sheet is because he made it that way. That goes to show who he is now and I'm not judging him solely on this one game but he's been this way recently and it NEEDS TO STOP! If we want to win the biggest glory is European club football.
Another game once again where Messi ghost and doesn’t score and this is coming from someone who actually wants to see him win and I am starting to believe is it Becasue he’s holding for World Cup? Or Messi just is old and can’t show out with kylian or is it becasue he can’t when it comes to hard games?
JUVENTUS from the beginning of last season "We don't need Donaruma, we already have a world class goalkeeper" 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
Messi needs to adjust himself as a rookie soccer player very different style of playing. He should never leave Barcelona psg to much power no strategy like Spanish soccer .
Mbappe was selfish
Selfish mbappe
Donarumma trash and I’m glad that he left milan cos Milan don’t need cry baby and demanding player like him. Milan will be rise back like 1980-1990 and just wait for it
So mad mbappe didn’t pass to ney he’s in my fantasy 🤬
TMNT vs TOM THE CAT Who will be this generations goat?
I don’t know when Mbappe will ever learn to pass the ball..
Mbappe only got speed. He is way overrated
with little effort Juventus scared PSG.  what a bunch of losers to think they would ropll Juventus over by 6 goals and barely end up asking the ref for the whistle.
Lol! Verratti took one for the team. 1:06
Mbappe needs to be benched  'cause he's selfish. Psg will b much better & will ultimately win the championship without this guy. Hope he gets injured 🙏
That elbow on Verrati’s face 😂😂😂😂😂1:07
That older gentleman announcer always has the best descriptions! I remember watching him on bein sports commenating la Liga. Awesome to hear him doing the champions league
If they dont teach mbape how to pass a ball there going to be in trouble whit stronger teams
Where is Pogba?
Juve really made a mistake selling de ligt
Sell Mbappe
where number one where number one where number one go team go messi go psg go messi go team go psg go
Man, I missed Ray Hudson commentating on games. It's been a while since the last time I heard him in a match so this is gonna be a good move from CBS
Donaruma no sirve
Mbape is selfish
And the prize for the worst commentary duo goes to . . .
That boi ray Hudson been a min since I heard him
I need this team to win and that happens if mbappe starts actually passing and defense knows how to defend
Slowly but surely Navas will be going out sad to see
05:03 Neyman free and Mbappe like an idiot.
After watching MBappe selfishness, I don’t think PSG will stand a chance against other Teams. They won this time because Juventus played bad during the first half.  They could’ve won this by 5 to 1. But MBappe keep making shots to score goals when he clearly have no chance instead of assisting.  Too bad.
It’s been so long since I’ve heard good ol Ray Hudson. The only English commentator who isn’t horribly boring
5:00 how do you go from playing good to just being a jackazz again
Sell this frog already
Mbappe so fucking selfish bro, just pass to neymar kid ffs 🤦🏾‍♂️
The commentary on this game was top notch.   “Do you remember that, from the Muppets?” “You’re a muppet”
Who else saw verrati get elbowed by kimpembe 😂😂
I'm surprised PSG felt the need to buy such stars to win a farm league... I suppose they just want international titles.
Mbappe is so fucking selfish.
Glad to see Weston take advantage of this chance but wish his teammates took time to celebrate with him Ik they’re behind but there’s 40 mins left when he scores
If Mpabbe plays like this he can cause them some elimination in the knockout stages... just pass for simple goals pls
Donnaruma bad goalkeeper 😡
Ray Hudson is back!
Is it me or the announce is 10 min behind
I really miss keylor NAVAS...🤔🤔🤔
The announcers obvs were delayed in seeing the game live cause both goals youll notice their behind the action by a couple seconds.
5:35 is that kid flicking somebody off ? Lmao
ray hudson in champions league is a W
Now entering the era of Haaland and Mbappe
PSG was lucky
Mbappe is crazy to not hit Neymar on that one chance 🤦🏾‍♂️
poor Verratti, man got hit in the nose by kimpembe
Nose quiere ablar delA pulga pero toca nombrar ala pulga ta dormido quedado muy quedado ta la pulga
10:55 you can see Neymar intellect in the game: he receives the ball, M'bappe asks for the ball for a run, Neymar knows M'Bappe will get tired and will get cut by the second defender, or won't have the breath left to kick the ball strong enough, another player calls the ball on the right same scenario he will get cut, he knows they are tired to make long runs, they have been playing for 1h29min, so  Neymar decides to control the ball, dribble to give time to M'Bappe to find his perfect posture for shooting, within his run he takes the 4 defenders, they all run towards Neymar, the purpose was to make a whole in the defense line for the pass, he did the job with magnificence, he put Kylian in a perfect spot to score. Like he did for Kylian's opening goal, Impressive.
Mbtap-in again with the egoist not sharing the ball,  is gonna cost them. You don't win games by being selfish and trying to Stat paddle. Pass the ball idiot or you ain't win champions
Same thing gonna happen all season… Mbappe thinks only of Mbappe🤷‍♂️
Coaches have to start to understand Leo's body language. When you're up 2-0 but things are falling apart, just give the balls to Leo's feet. Over and over. He'll slow the game down, start the possession and positive passing chemistry, and STILL link with Neymar and Mbappe.
Love a yank and a nonce commentating….
Esta quedando atrás pulga no veo goles q te pasa pulga
Can’t believe mbappe didn’t square that ball to Neymar
Mbapee scores twice still, he has a horrible game he is not even on the same level as Messi or Neymar he is just a child wanting to show up. Neymar was the real.MVP of the game
PSG will not win the CL because of the selfishness of Mbappe. This dude is overrated. Neymar is heads over shoulders better than him. He doesn't even know how to make a simple lobbed pass.
Man at 7:00 if Mbappe score that would have been a MNM magic. From messi to Neymar to messi and the finisher mbappe. Understand that Mbappe might be selfish at time but we need his speed and talent… they gotta come together and sync up.
Mbappe selfish. He only cares about himself. Perfect example, him shooting when Neymar is WIDE OPEN💀.
DO YOU HAVE TO SHOW THE SUBSTITUTIONS ??????????????  IN AN 11-MINUTE HIGHLIGHTS PROGRAM  ????????????  😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩
Donaruma fails at least one per.game
I can’t believe how selfish Mbappe is. I mean, come on, Neymar was wide open for a tap in goal, but, instead he chose to go for that selfish hat trick. Me, me. Can someone tell this guy is a team game not individual sport. Perhaps he should play tennis. 🤦‍♂️
Everyone lost their ego when mbappe didn’t pass a clear ball
Though psg wins the game. I am pretty much sure that psg will Not go far at uefa, Mbapee is the cancer of this team.  He only thinks to have his personal score instead of team‘s winning.  Beside, he Neymar or Messi as a nanny to feed him in order to score.  Psc  management sucks.
NOBODY AT CHELSEA CAN HIT A BALL ONE TIME LIKE MBAPPE??? THEY NEED 3-4 TOUCHES AND THEN A LATERAL PASS☹️
Ray Hudson back in action 🔥🔥 Magesterial iykyk
Mbappe is to selfish in front of goal, if he passes back to Messi or squares to Neymar PSG easily win this game 4-1
Mbappe position is striker he scores the goals and the wingers supposed to assist. Everyone complaining he should pass more how about creating more for him? Everyone has a specific position as a winger you create and score when you can not the other way around. Neymar and Messi clearly don’t want to pass to Mbappe at times and you can see why Mbappe doesn’t want to pass to them as well. Keep the same energy for all three of them. They have their own egos and it’s getting in their way. 🤔
Ray Hudson! Yesssssssss!!
Messi being expose he isn’t that good as what Barca fans were hyping him up
Dropped a pint of beer into a shot glass at the other end of the bar...yo my guy got dem bars going u the 🐐  bro
Sergio se mira como un compañero que uno le agarra cariño
donnoruma is so shaky man. how does navas not start? 😆
0:50 PSG First Goal 2:19 PSG Second Goal 5:13 Juventus Goal
ayo ray hudson??? i can FINALLY hear him commentate a bayern game ❤
hate the american commentators with such a passion
Verratti has made a difference in that midfield that’s facts, Mbappe was my MOTM for today with the 2 goals!
I'm glad an American scored today for Juventes
Mbappe was very selfish on that chance he had to pass to Neymar when he was wide open on the other side, definitely needs to change that also, Neymar also messed up when he had a wide open guy in soler making the run that would’ve left him 1v1 with goalkeeper almost at the end but decided to keep holding the ball.
When Neymar was completely open for the goal and mbapee misses, Neymar just looked at him.
why are the announcers on a delay?
I dont care about the game. THE BEST TRANSFER ALL SEASON IS RAY HUDSON ON GAMES AGAIN!!!!!!
MBAPPÉ Haters wya?
Mbapee  mentality is very poor..he should grow up
Messi doesn’t look happy mbappe scoring then again mbappe eliminated Messi in the world and In the champion league that’s crazy
Ray Hudson, where have u been? 🤩🤩🤩
Bro psg play so well as a team.
Neymar + Mbappe fun to watch !
Why are we still watching substitutions in a highlight reel???????? Please show me 1 person who wants to what a Sub walk on and off!
Could of been 4-1 times were Neymar and kylian could of passed it to make a goal but no
Messi did nothing today😕
Should of been 5-1, JUV GK is a monster
I miss Ray sooo much
Brazil will win the World Cup
Wait did Neymar ignore Messi on the counter n instead hug the ball n feed Mbappe 😂 tears bro he not gonna make the ceo mad
Ph nice
Psg needs a new keeper for real
Dude are little girl’s commentating the game? What’s up with the little squeals lol
Juve had clear cut chances bro
They got Ray Hudson in champions league
Can we just appreciate Neymar's assist at the start of the game? He makes something out of nothing with an incredible chip that is harder than it looks. Of course, amazing volley from Mbappe to create the goal too
if mbappe would just square it
Do you guys feel like PSG still lacks chemistry at their defense set up 🤔🤔🤔
psg look so vulnerable
At the 5min mark Mbappe had another chance to pass to Neymar for an easy goal
Sergio ramos asking the ball questions as it goes in.
Sergio ramos asking the ball questions as it goes in.
KM tryna get that hat trick n avoid Neymar 😂😂 he is that guy thou u can’t get mad at him 😂😂
So great to hear Ray Hudson commenting Champions League
1:08 Veratti 😂
Selfish prick needs to pass the ball. Smh
1:05 Kimpembe elbowing Verratti in the face has me dead😂😂😂
Mckennie likes playing against Messi, scoring against the best in the World again!
Ray Hudson is back!!! Where has he been!???
Verrati getting elbowed during the celebration of the first goal was priceless
This team is a👺 n a fucking 🧸 at the same time
Lol @5:00 that would have been an easy goal for Neymar. Mr Mbappe did it again 🤣🤣🤣 looking for a hat trick.
When will American broadcasters learn… terrible commentators like the usual! Also wtf is the latency all about?
These commentators are TERRIBLE. Please change them. Bring back the elegant Peter drury
Mbappe's selfishness will cause PSG another Champions League glory. When will this kid learn?
MCKENNNIIIIEEEEEE
Psg just cant lose
That stupid ass turlte  is finna get psg knocked out
Ramos is too Goated
If Mbape passed the ball, this would be no contest.
Ray is back 🤩🤩
is no one going to talk about verrati getting elbowed 😂😂 1:07
Mbappe needs to pass the ball  For the second goal if the roles were reversed there’s no way he passes the ball back and that will be psg’s downfall
Mbappe is a beast 👌
Hope Galtier goes back to his 3-4-1-2 that’s he’s used every week in ligue 1. Otherwise Messi will be the same week in week out. Needs a lot of the ball or he becomes lost. Can’t plop him at right wing and expect him to sprint past people. Especially when he only gets the ball when wandering into the middle. Can’t combine with Neymar much
Mbpape is selfish
Forza Juventus. I can't wait for us to be at full power.  Good goals by Kylian.
Juventus goal was a defense distraction. there is no way that a defense can allow that. PSG looks way too superior to Juventus.. PSG relaxes too much during the games when they feel they can beat their opponent easily.
Mbappe is the most selfish player ever.
Tbh Mbappe used to be my favorite player but seeing how selfish he has become, I'm not a fan.
I cant belive this annoying commentator,got a new job again.
I think the PSG assists are a work of art. Mbappe does the easy part.
Ray Hudson commentating for the UCL 👌🏻
JUVE NEEDS NEW BRAND NEW KEEPER
Kylian mbape selfish Neymar selfish what’s wrong guys football is pass and don’t be selfish that’s it
Oh how I have missed Ray Hudson, my favorite commentator in the world.
PSG defense 💩
Mbappe is a spectacular talent, but the lad needs to learn how to be a team player. It'll destroy their chemistry and prevent them from lifting the trophy if he doesn't
"This game has tightened up like a vice" Ray Hudson 🤣
Mbappe is such a selfish player. His selfishness will be the reason PSG never win a UCL.
Mbappe needs to learn how to pass..
psg goalkeeper sucks
1:07 Kimpembe elbowed Verratti in the face. Ouch!
Only way PSG win the UCL is if Messi scores a worldie, or Mbappe starts passing the ball
Mbappe missed way to much this game
'A blueberry muffin pass with a strawberry sprinkle finish. He says to the man let me get the mail, here is the milk, I will be right back, and rings up the groceries, then scores.' WTF.
lol verrati at 1:07
Mbappe Misses Sitters & Doesn't Pass When He should.  Messi Tired Of Him Fucking Up His Stats 🤣
Look @1:10 poor verati got elbowed
Great game! And as an American, I'm glad that McKennie is doing well and should keep earning consistent minutes this fall under Allegri.
This commentator follows messi wherever he goes.
1:06, Veratti KIA.
Ray Hudson commentating in the Champions League is 🔥🔥
Mbappe is selfish
NO WAY WE FINALLY GOT RAY HUDSON ON CHAMPIONS LEAGUE!!!
Can you imagine how different things would be if Juventus had picked up Veratti instead of PSG? The guy has been a class midfielder for a decade now.
The commentator has a very squeaky high pitch voice. Quite annoying
PSG look genuinely inspired this season. Front three don't need the ball long to make magic happen, and Mbappe's finishing is just deadly.
What a goalkeeper from Juve, wow he stopped 3 shots destined for glory….
PSG didn't look convincing. Started strong at the beginning, and lost energy throughout the game.
God I can’t stand commentator 🤦‍♂️
Best players are Messi and Neymar
Who saw kimpembe’s elbow on Verratti’s face? HahahahhahHhHhHh
The way Mbappe is playing with his selfishness is very dangerous.  As long they are winning is good, but if the team doesn't, he should take the blame. They could've scored so many goals if he had pass the ball to his teammates.   It looks like he is obsessed with ballon d'or . He been talking about it a lot lately and the way he plays, it make sense that he wants it really bad.   That is a Big gamble.  Messi and neymar will retire soon and you won't have someone like them on your team anymore, so by being obsessed with the ballon d'or, could backfire for him in the future
At around 1:08 kimpembe elbowed veratti 😭😭
The hate Mbappe gets is funny. I think he is head and shoulders the best player in the world today.  Yes he could’ve passed a couple of times but so could Neymar. He’s a striker, a little bit of selfishness can be forgiven.
Ray Hudson is back!!!!
Yeah, I can't see this PSG team winning this year either...
Was Ray Hudson on vacation or something where has he been?
#AllegriOut
Damn mbappe!! Neymar was wide open for the 3 rd goal
Passes le ballon M’Bappé! Sois pas égoïste! 🙄
Ray Hudson missed you man
Where’s Pepsi I couldn’t see him was he’s playing
Neymar and Messi are pure magic together. If Mbape was willing to pass the ball this would have probably been 3-4.
I never seen any player who’s more selfish than Mbappe. the dude is a pure definition of egocentrism. How many times did he have the chance to pass the ball where players were had a a kick away from a goal? If anything, he’s going to be the downfall of PSG. Absolutely ridiculous.
1:07 kimpembe elbowing verratti’s big nose 🤣
Psg are a good team but they never win the cup
Don’t think I’ll ever get used to Messi getting subbed out
Poor Verratti in 1:06 🥲
1:06 😂😂
Kimpembe hit verati in the nose wit his elbow 💀
So we not gonna talk about how Verratti got smacked at 1:06 ?
Mbappé still silencing the haters. Admittedly, my guy should pass in some cases.
wtf is this audio
could have been easily 5 or 6 goals from PSG had mbappe did a bit more passing, but hey im sure psg fans are happy with a win in the end of the day
mbappe never passes
Mbappe is fucking selfish. I don’t know how long Neymar and Messi can put up with his selfishness.
Why is Donnarumma still starting? Not only is Navas better and more experienced, but Donnarumma consistently makes positioning and other mistakes that lead to poor goals
Ray Hudson❤
1:07 🤣
Let's see if Juve can get better for when PSG goes to Turin they can return the favor and win.
Mbappe needs to pass dont get me wrong he’s really good but dude nobody cares if u scored 300 goals with like 10 assists
4:57 tells you all you need to know about Mbappe
Ray Hudson needs to call more big matches
Messi you had no business going to PSG! Mbappe is selfish!! Too egotistical
Neymar is the best player on the planet
There are times in a game when you think this PSG team can steamroll any team in the world and there are times in the same game when you think they can also easily lose to any average competitive team in the world.

“It’s the calculus of football’s equations solved in two movements”  Stupefyingly magnificent second goal Mbappe
Juve should have equalized and PSG should have scored more goals
I’m starting to think most of the people in the comments didn’t watch the full match
Wow soccer sucks now cause Americans are actually scoring lol. I remember back in the day u never heard about any American making noise overseas . Donovan tried but still . How can u with iconic players like Ronaldo from Brazil ,Luis figo and all the other greats . Now they talk about Pulisic and he barely plays. Soccer doesn’t have any stars anymore 🤣🤣🤣🤣
360p? why the low resolution???
Kimpembe almost burst veratti face in the goal celebration who saw that
"STUPIFYINGLY MAGNIFICENT! "  I missed you Ray <3
I don’t care what people say about him- Mbappe is one of the best in the world
Juventus needs as strikers  DIMARIA, DYBALA, HIGUAÍN, & NONETHELESS SUPER MARIO MANDZUKIC UP FRONT, IN DA MIDDLE PAREDES, CUADRADO, DOUGLAS COSTA, & POGBA,
Mckennie 👌
I wonder what Ramos told Allegri at 4.70
Neymar and Mbappe are on fire🔥! I promise you if they were both Less selfish and thought more about the team winning, they will score so much more and be unstoppable!
Is that  Ray Hudson
Verrati’s face 😂1:06
Sad that with PSG'S full lineup especially at their home stadium, they only beat a trash Juventus lineup 2-1. Juventus could have won if donnarumma didn't reach those shots, and mbappe did not pass the ball and missed some shots. Imagine if Di Maria and Pogba weren't injured and played this match.
*Even though psg won, they still looked weak. If they continue like this they won't even make it to the final*
PSG will never win this tournament. The Goal keeper is garbage and Mbappe is to selfish.
What a great performance from Mbappe,Amazing!
Selfishness wi cost PSG in the end if they don't get it figured out..now
is ray Hudson the Scott sterling guy
Anyone else see veratti get hit in the face during the celebrations
Yo Roy Hudson commentating holy shit
Start Navas…. Psg could of won 3-0 or 4-0 if mbappe learns to pass
If cristiano Ronaldo signed for psg what would’ve been the result of this Mach
smh what is this quality cbs
If mbappe knew to pass this game would’ve been 4 easy
If mbappe signed for Real Madrid what would’ve been the result of this Mach
Ayyo we got Roy hudson commentating CL!
Psg dominated first 45, slowed down in the second. PSG need a good holding midfield, not veratti.
The arrogance Juventus fans and their players have always warrants defeat in Europe. Vlahovic really could have been one of the greatest of all time in Florence, now he’s playing with these idiots
Only 360p? Come on, 1080p or 720p 60 fps at least
Mbapee never passes the ball when it matters. Mbapee always wants to be the hero of the team. He cares about scoring goals, but he fails on clear chances to score when he could have pass the ball to Ney or Messi for an easier goal. And the truth is that if Mbapee still wants to be a hero, he will go to bed and cost us in the long run in quarterfinals or in the round of 16.
Not the greatest performance from PSG. Messi wasn't at his best either, but he will come back stronger. Still a good win, Mbappe is on 🔥, and Ray Hudson commentating the champions league🥹!!!
