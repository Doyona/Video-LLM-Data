Max was so good on this show, espn is absolutely chalked now
Watching in 2023
This is why Max isn't on First Take anymore!🤣 SAS wasn't mad at Max for admitting he was wrong, SAS was mad at Max for giving LeBron his flowers!🤣  Which is why, when Perk began to give LeBron his flowers as well, SAS shut down! SAS wants to play both sides, because he's  a MJ protectionist like Skip! SAS just wants to be slicker with his! So he will downgrade LeBron as much as possible to help MJ, but will also praise him, inorder to have proof he's not an MJ protector! It's all calculated!
Its crazy to think that the heat could have actually beat this lakers team
Stephen A will you PLEASE shut the f*** up!!! 🤣😂🤣
Let's go Pelicans
𝔽𝕚𝕣𝕖 𝕞𝕒𝕩 𝕒𝕟𝕕 𝕙𝕚𝕣𝕖 𝕞𝕚𝕜𝕖 𝕧𝕚𝕔𝕜 𝕡𝕝𝕫🤔
MOVE NBA TO CHINA
Jimmy butler you are the best player in NBA
3 clone...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 it's over in game 5...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Back here after the heat take it to 6 lmao
Stephen smith your always boastful man, i think you always know what is right, but you fail man, game6 is coming.. i dont believe you, youre a boastful ugly man..
Who is here after Stephen A was wrong and the series went 6 games
get of Lebron nutts!!
Clowns!
Well these opinions didn’t age well...
3 of these four are about to get laid off . You did it to yourselves ESPN. Enjoy it now commies
Yet were heading to a game 6. Sorry Stephen A
I hope the Lakers will  win tonight coming on K👑J.
ESPN can’t play highlights or SLO-mo without generic trap-hop over it lmao
Lakers in 5
God i cant stand stephen A.
Rondon should be a couch and Lebrom should be a owner in future
I cant stand Stephan A Smith
The fact that AD got to rest gives the Lakers an incredible edge to win it all. AD always breaks down and cannot withstand the wear and tear of a normal NBA season.
Without A.D lakers dont win.. Lebum takes credit for everything plus the lebum fans won't admit it...
Stephen A, you constantly try to discredit Max because his points are generally more sound than yours..
bla bla bla. max ur trash
So loud
That Danny Green deal was awful lol. Have to give Rob flak for that bust.
At least max admits he was wrong. Unlike skip bayless
But Stephen lowercase a and skip flip flop should have stayed on the same show they both do alot CAP and KP he trash. I think lebron is the goat and I'm a Lakers fun but these three just the worst and J will to man I just cant with them
Stephen A got a fresh cut
Stephen A needs to leave Max alone 🙄
LeBron 👑 is great, the MVP🏆 but I need to to start a fund raiser for his hair.👴🏀Go Lakers!🏀Lol😂😂😂
stephen a. so annoying af
Well yeah, that's what we expected
ONLY IF SKIP WOULD ACCEPT LEBRON LIKE MAX BRUH
Miami in 7!! Trust me
Miami may get one more win 😂
lol i love how stephen A dude called max out for that bs.
Nassau  Bahamas  242 king  james this  for Kobe  Bryant
Nassau  Bahamas  242 king  james this  for Kobe  Bryant
Y
Max Kellerman da GoAT
Rondo's super high basketball IQ definitely the hidden x factor in this series.
What's the percentage of people who hate-watch Stephen A. vs. people who actually watch him because he says anything worth saying? I'm guessing 80-20, easy.
Jimmy tired just like the nuggets to keep on carrying his team we all know who's winin the finals lakers 4-1
I am pretty sure so many reporters said that the Clippers would win this year though. I only see Max admiting that he is wrong lol
4:38 thank me later
lord, they gonna give labumboy the mvp. there's a reason why AD 'played' bad. entire heat team has no answer to him but he didn't show up? he in a bubble so he had bad sleep or something? lol
I can’t help but think KP and Young Jeezy are related some how
I dont recall max saying this stuff right after he beat portland or houston?? it was always, just wait til Kawhi, he will have to show it against him... Now that the guy who he said was going to win the chip no matter what team he went to, the guy who he was talking about being teh best and the smartest because of load management and all that matters is the playoffs, didnt make it, now all of a sudden hes back on lebron... pathetic
Stephan A was acting childish, just because you interrupt someone doesn't mean you are winning a debate lol
The Underdogs going home with their tails between their legs tomorrow night.
AD IS THE FINALES MVP
Imagine SAS doing this to Skip
There is something seriously wrong with Stephen A. He acts like a scorned lover with Max or he was flat out rejected.
KP hasn't been long on the show, but I love his inputs!! Hope to see him for a long time
I really hated max too for all those kawhi talked. But respect when he admits he was wrong about lebron. But theres one more you have to take back please max, and you did not take it back, even when clippers chokes a 3-1 lead in the 2nd round, you still fighting for kawhi is more clutched than the great kobe bryant, thats one of the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard, take it back man.
I have to disagree to perk. When he said praise rob pelinka for signing kcp, rondo, dwight. It's actually lebron james, he's the guy who they approach if they arz going to sign someone, magic has said that before when he was a president, they asked lebron first, because lebron knew them well, because he played with them, ans rondo said in his interviewed, about playoff rondo, rondo said there's a purpose why lebron bring's me to lakers.
Stephen A so annoying on this one smh
How Max misunderstood“keep the same energy” tho
Everyone remember max said “lebron was next to Michael Jordan in all aspects in the regular season” then proceeded to say and he still elevates in the playoffs. What does that mean? Lebron the goat
Max that is not what keep that same energy means at all my guy
Stephen you a hypocrite, you chose the clippers right before the playoffs
Kendrick is like, mum and dad are fighting again
I really think heat will win in 5 for ratings yeah ikr
Keep that same energy stephen A lol 😆
SAS has became so annoying since a few months
The Lakers will grab the title this year. Go out and get the other Morris twin and repeat. Then in Bron last year will go ahead  and three peat and retire a champion
Get rid of Stephen A man. so annoying!
Cutt it off Smith you are getting sooooo annoying and utterly disrespectful. Seems you will keep on mocking your coworkers for the next hundred years. Boooooring!!!
Rondoooo first ballot HOF
Max moonwalking back his Kawahi talk so much now.
Even if Shannon is not on this team, this is way better than Skip and Shannon. Skip's really skipid sounding with whatever he says.
Man of the analysts out max maybe the best just because he's willing admit a mistake and ' keep that same energy'. Love it.
“Quickest transition in the history of television” 🤣🤣🤣 that phrase got me
The sad thing is nobody uses “Keep That Same Energy” like Max put it, at least not in comments for this show. These idiots use it expecting Max to keep upping Kawhi as the best despite being proven wrong, I’ve seen it many times.   He absolutely has switched the opinion back to Lebron and gets no credit for it. He bought too hard into Kawhi’s playoff run last year, as did a lot of people. The Clippers had better supporting parts but without Kawhi matching that year, are they really the favorites? Not to me.
Whether any of you guys are Lakers fans or not, whether you’re stoked or not to see them win it for Kobe or to see Lebron and AD get 4 and 1 respectively... Is anyone else STOKED to see this group of guys like Playoff Rondo, Team First Howard, Laker Javale, Carushow, etc. win a title together? I’m so happy that Howard’s first gets to possibly happen here in the year of Kobe, that Rondo gets to win another 10 years later against the team who beat them, plus AD and all the young guys.
Feel bad for Max😂
4:34 kp look like Santa Claus 😂
SHUT UP SAS. LET THE MAN FINISH!
green, kuz gotta go next season
SAS needs to stfu he picked the clippers 8 weeks ago when supposedly the lakers looked bad in the first week of the bubble. Now he acting like all along he had the Lakers. Smfh
Stephen a smith lost a lot of peoples respect with this one
Can you imagine if LeBron in his prime had AD for as long as Jordan had Pippen? He'd already have 7 rings.
I heard you are FIRING hundreds of your EMPLOYEES, and NBA final was down 70 % Viewership. Go WOKE GET BROKE !
i think KCP produced in the finals the way he did because Lebron trusted both him and Danny Green since the beginning of the regular season even though both of them are shooting bricks...and it's paying off right now, at least for KCP.

"Talk to me about last night"
Y’all stay cuttting off Kendrick Perkins 😡
Sorry but I gotta say the Lakers are leaving the Bubble...FRIDAY NIGHT.
@miamiheat  Use it as fuel
The Heat has been commendable this season, but just need some more firepower.
He's not as good as Wade but putting up 27, 10 assist and 7.8 rebounds are superstar numbers in the finals for Butler
That "Im coming from you." from Stephen A is from the hood!! Lol
Ban KP from any sports shows, trying to blow my speakers every time
Cmon Steve don't do Max like that, I feel bad for him, he's already admitted it.. what else do you want him to do? shave his head? LOL
So max can't make a valid statement after admitting he was wrong? They're analysts not psychics 🤦🏽‍♂️ sheesh
SHUT UP STEPHEN A FFS
LEGOAT
Love stephen A😘😘
LeBron and thr Lakers success this post season might produced another super team to stop them.
Stephen A! In the words of Biden “will you shut up!”
It’s crazy that nobody really talked about KCP when he was in Detroit once lebron said he wanted to play with him the lakers went and got him before lebron even headed to LA lmaoooo crazy
Stephen A vs Max kellerman rivalary was greater than LA rivalary this season🤣
Nah Max you got the meaning of "Keep that Same Energy" ALL THE WAY WRONG my dog.. You said Khawai was the best so don't change now "Keep that Same Engery" haha
HD experience with ESPN
KP is just enjoying this argument that Max and Stephen A is having 😂
King James makes history; next, the NBA blackball him.
I don’t like Max but he did say he was wrong which I can respect.
So now Stephan A  is off the hook for jumping on and off the Lakers bandwagon all season?
😂😂😂
Why does this clown(Perkins) have a job!! Can’t stand the foo!!!! Just how he was trash his whole carrier his even more garbage in this job
Bro Stephen A smith is annoying like bruh u want Max to be like Skip and never admit when he is wrong like that’s stupid and don’t get me started on KP😂😂
Max you was hating on Lebron this whole time and hyping Kahwi now that Kawhi sitting at home now he flips lol wow
Remember when grown men made millions playing a sport we all loved only to screw it up? NO ONE IS WATCHING
look u cant compare Jimmy Butler and D wade performances in finals bc even a YOUNG D-WADE aint BEATING NO LBJ AND AD
Lol @quickest transition, from Kawhi to Lebron brutal shade of Stephen to Max😂😂😂
lol, Max no idea was "same energy" means, lol.
Noone cares !   Noone watches.
Wouldn't it be karma if Trump's last words were, "I can't breathe!"?
Stephen a is a narcissist
What does plucky mean max??
KCP IS THE XFACTOR THAT AD AND LEBRON NEEDED ALONG WITH THE CARUSHOW....AND DONT FORGET RAJON....😉
i'm not counting out Miami until the Lakers finish.  it ain't over til it's over
KCP was huge for us last night.
No one is talking about kuzma he showed up too
oh watever Steph  I  STILL SALUTE  MAX.... ! He's one  of the BEST  commentator!!!
Why do they have to call him stephen A smith?  Stephen is ok too
Moly should've done her job and controlled the situation. It was Max's turn and SAS just kept talking over him. Also, why does everyone feel the need to jump on Max all the time?
I rather have someone like Max who admits whenever he's wrong than Colin or Skip, always omitting whenever they are wrong or flipping the narrative outta nowhere when they were proven wrong.
Give it to him Stephen A, the doubters need to eat their words for thinking the Clippers could beat the team of LA 💯
I really do not agree with that they say. Am i the only one who thinks lakers did not had such a great game ? i mean, dont get me wrong they deserved winning, but until the last 2 minutes of the game it was pretty much open to both teams. lakers made the buckets, heat didnt, thats the bottom line for me.
4:38 KP laugh 😂😂😂😂
Kobe & Shaq = AD & Lebron 💯🔥💪🏽💪🏽‼️
rondo shine  around great  player  no by him self
Jimmy butler didnt score because The best defender in the playoffs was on him he needed adebeyo to score or someone
espn what a blood sucker  you people  are
Stephen A is pathetic at this point
Max killed these 2 clowns
*N.B.A Tournament Champions Lakers . That sounds about right 🤔
Why y’all sleep on rondo 😞 that game
As a heat fan im not a hater of LeBron. For me his the greatest player.  the heat will be champion soon we need centers, big men next season we are lacking so much big men
The disrespect on khawi how quickly the forget
Stephen A. is a clown
Entertainer or not Stephen A is just mad disrespectful he crosses too many lines and acts like a child arguing. Imagine if someone argued with you like that in person. You would think they were crazy.
sas not letting go.
SAS is annoying
This is off topic but I would to see kendrick perkins with his own show
A.d. daddy
Jimmy butler is overrated, too much mouth.
“And now he’s raving about Lebron James “ 🤣🤣
Perk made good points.
stephen a hates lebron, ever since he said he needs to check his sources
Stephen A is so annoying. Max has admitted time after time again that he was wrong.
KP: I respect your opinion this is built on guys everyone else gave up on.  LBJ, AD and Rondo made this season work. This is what you call TEAM BASKETBALL.
Not everybody can shoot as many free throws as D Wade did in 2006
Stephen A. Knows basketball and a great host etc. But Max is smart asf. He knows what he doing
Yes Max, the Warriors and Clippers do not exist lmfao
Fake finals
Stephen A Smith used to be weird but passionate and funny, however I can’t stand his attitude towards Max nowadays, it’s like « You were wrong one time, everything you will ever say is therefore invalid. ».
kawhi has been out the playoffs for about a month now
GET DAMIAN LILLARD TO MIAMI ASAP
I think they'll win at least 2 more together. Im not saying 3 peat.  Just over time.  Lebron and AD will get 2 more rings together.
SAS YOU DID NOT...I REPEAT.....YOU DID NOT NEED TO USE THE WORD BLOVIATING 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Kendrick perkins be on his knees praising lebron fam wipe yo mouth after💀💀💀
keep that same energy😂
This was the most boring and predictable finals ever
Nah... we’re Y’all boy Jimmy Buckets at now? IN TROUBLE!!
I am tired of watching Steven A making fun of Max when he was wrong, when the other way around Steven A would just act cute with the Dr. Evil picky next to the mouth gesture and then pretended nothing happened 3 min later.
Steven A starting to get out of line. Max admitted he was wrong about Lebron. No need to get on him for 20 minutes because of it. You've made plenty of mistakes might I remind you Steven A
KCP is what everyone thought Kuz would be...
Not gonna lie, I didn't hope that jimmy butler would turn into dwade. Cause it wasn't gonna happen
Can't stand Stephen A's constant intertrupting.
Validate max N word pass already.
If Lebron AD and Kyrie was In Cleveland that would’ve been a super team
Le Bron was the real coach at the Cavs
Heat had a good run and season.
Heat in 7
Tbh almost everybody said clippers except laker fans
Stephen A Smith is getting really annoying
Let's be Real... NOBODY is watching this TRASH. Numbers don't lie. Worse NBA Finals TV ratings in HISTORY. Le Bron (FAKE GOAT)is in these finals too...HaHaHa. MJ would NEVER EVER have TV RATINGS bad as this. Don't Hate... MICHAEL JEFFREY JORDAN IS AND FOREVER WILL BE NBA G.O.A.T PERIOD!!!!!
Max - “He’s about to gentleman sweep the entire western conference”....Oh snap had no idea we were in the WCF!
I'm just hear to say that just like millions & millions of patriotic Americans, I couldn't give  flying f about anything regarding the CCP-loving & phony NBA.  I didn't leave the NBA, the NBA left me.
Now that your clippers are out you talk wonders about LB lol🤣🤣🤣😂max..
4:22 "all year wrong" lol
LeBron has never played with a teammate that's as dominant as AD is. That's not a slap in the face to a guy like D WADE but D-WADE and AD are built differently.
It’s Over For The Miami Heat Lakers Will Going To Win The NBA Title
thats not what "keep the same energy" means lmaoo
I just heard y’all say that the series was over in game one everyone has changed their tone sure the Lakers will win but I think sports annalists should be held accountable for saying dumb things.
I wish the GSW was healthy, no hate but lebron got one of the best Pf in the league and y’all talking about him like he the one who doing everything and it’s because of him they gonna win the finals 😂 just stop it man , just without ad he can’t even beat the heat and we clearly saw it in game 3 when ad was in fouls trouble.
SA needa stop acting like he wasn't on the same clipper bandwagon after LAL- Portland game 1
KCP saved lakers
Heat was in the game until last minutes lebron and AD were not great supporting cast saved lakers if lakers want to end this series they have to play lot better
omg shut up stephen A and let max talk
Respect to Max, admits he was wrong about Lebron. Skip Bayless too proud to admit he was wrong.
Stephen a is so annoying man. Let max talk 😂😂😂
Max was not wrong but come on stop going against Stephen A... he was just having a little fun!
IM BALLIN LIKE AN LA LAKER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5:20 Stephen A was right about the same energy lol
Dang listening to stephen a smith just hit me this foo is an ANGRY NERD
Max Career is going to Flourish after he leaves this show & I for one cant wait to see it. I know its stressful for him to do this show day in & day out.  Steven A is just as bad as Brandon Marshall. At this point I dont want to see either of them on TV.  When that Ego gets deflated. Oh what a day that'll be
As a Canadian I can infer that Max switches teams like Canadians jumped onto the raptors bandwagon May 2019.
No cap kawaii had fokes shook for a minute before he fell off. if u say otherwise u lying. But them NB ads gon haunt him forever
I agree with SAS, KCP was the x-factor, but also Morris, Morris hit all his Open 3's and we needed everyone of those, cuz it almost seemed like Miami could not miss...Laker nation bout to celebrate come Friday baby
Perk never ever praise the signing of Danny Green. He's been god awful all playoffs long for someone getting paid $15 million a year. He should be traded EXPEDITIOUSLY after the season is over
I was just thinking how Max moved out of Kawhi Leonard's house and has moved in with Lebron before Stephen Smith even brought it up 🤔😂😂
Bron is the Finals MVP bc them 2 3pointers he hit was crucial.. Rondo also came thru as well by making sure everyone was where they was supposed to be..
It's all good we going to kill the NBA the next game let's go Heat we can win from a 3-1 week
The Lakers are now 56-0 when leading after 3 quarters, the best in NBA history.  The 2018 Cavs were the 4th best team in NBA history when leading after 3, at 50-1.  Which means in LeBron’s last 2 healthy seasons his teams are an impossible 106-1 when leading after the 3rd quarter.  This is the definition of clutch.
Stephen A doing too much atleast Max owned up to being wrong Stephen A never does that he just screams louder and pouts when he’s wrong
WHAT ARE YOU DUMF--K LAKER FANS GOING TO TO DO WHEN YOUR BOY QUEEN LEBRON RETIRES AND YOUR BOY AD SIGNS LONG TERM WITH ANOTHER TEAM, YOU WILL BE THE WEST COAST PHOENIX SUNS
SAS IS A HYPOCRITE HAHAHA. HE BELIEVES KD IS BETTER THAN LBJ AND THERE IS NO GAP BETWEEN THE TWO..... HAHAHA
Trade danny green please
Why is perkins on there?
I watch James cry his self too a ring this year
Stephen give Rob P. and Jeannie Buss an apology because a year ago you accused them of ruining this franchise after Magic left.
Bruh SAS the best television personality on TV I swear Can't stand Im a Lakers fan Max Kellerman but hates on them when they lose oh & he still mad bc wayoff P & choke Leonard aren't in the NBA Finals
Everyone in the comments acting like Stephen A and Max don’t get along. They’re like brothers, this ain’t the presidential debate. Stop that nonsense
Why they cut off Perkins like that, his take was goin somewhere
Thank you K-C-P!!!
Lebron will blow a 3-1 lead
lol Max use the phrase "keep that same energy" so wrong.
PUT AD WITH THE CLIPPERS AND PANDEMIC P WITH LEBRON, I THINK KAWHI WOULD BE IN THE FINALS RIGHT NOW. LETS NOT DISMISS KAWHI LIKE THAT
The NBA is fixed just like wrestling its fake
Max Lebron already gentlemen swept the west.
The man Perkins look like he just got home from church at night
I can't believe these dudes get millions behaving like little kids arguing which marvel superhero is better smh...
2020 will probably be the second chip Lebron is most proud of.
Max eats a lot of crow.
Lmao Stephen A putting Max on blast 💯💪😂
Jimmy Butler don't have Shaq or that bench MIAMI HAD ANTOINE WALKER,  ALONZO MORNING,  GARY PATYON, AND JASON WILLIAMS
Stephen A sometimes needs to shut up lol love the brother tho dont get me wrong
Credit BBallbreakdown for creating a video pointing out the Lakers secret weapon: Alex Caruso! Caruso has been the most consistent player off the bench. His defense has very good; he has many deflections, steals, and charges. Put him on Herro.
If Kobe or MJ played in the bubble they would average 50. No physical stress from moving from a state to an other, no mental stress bcz of the fans, it's practically a televised training camp at this point.
Max>SAS
Stephen a hates max so much lmao
Yooooo max kellerman is legendary haha
Max roasted haha
Game 5 is going to be a dogfight!!! Go Lakers!!!! Get that 17th Championship!!!
The only people watching these Finals are LeBron's mom....on Mark Cuban's couch snuggled up to Delonte West.
i dont understand what the problem is with Max admitting hes wrong...
Lakers choked.heat in 7
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿💯💯💯🗣😂
Max gna lose his job soon lol
Max is smart asf
i love it when MAX admits Lebron is  the best player and not  NR 2 :)))
Celtics blew it, inability to close games gave us the biggest mismatch in finals history
Next year Kevin Durant will be the new best player since it changes every year anyway according to these people..
Let's be real I had Lakers or Clippers winning the whole thing, but once Clippers let Nuggets tie Semi Finals series i knew Lakers were taking the whole thing🏀🏆💯
I just want Max to swing on SAS one day. He’s so disrespectful
Sas is being a hypocrite acting like he wasn't talking high and mighty about LeBron until Durants mom made him talk about KD more
Putting AD on Butler was as obvious as bringing an umbrella in a rainstorm. Butler is the key to the offense. Why is SAS acting like this is so brilliant? The offense runs thru Buler and AD has the height and lateral movement to stay with him.
Play Olinick on the brow when he sits play bam and run their legs off.Lakers big need bodies on them and play them astutely
Bloviate.... word of the day
Quickest transition in history of television 😂😂😂😂lol Stephen A
Stephen A, all love, but you're a bully.
Fvck Jordan! Lebron is the GOAT
Max is Slick 😂
Lakers are shutting down Duncan and Tyler Herro on the perimeter that’s the X factor
the heat is on
He gets paid all that money to be wrong all the time it must suck to wake up that miserable everyday peanut head looking boy
Maxis so fake since clippers lost
Stephen A is so annoying always trying to belittle Max & shut him down all the time. He talks most of the time, he can’t even let Max get his turn smh I rather see Max & Perk go at it rather then hear Stephen A needlessly shouting all the time. I’m surprised he has a voice still.
Next year is a  defensive juggernaut  Avery Bradley, KCP, LBJ, AD, D. Howard. See champions just use initials, sorry Avery you didn't get yours, but you'll get a ring too.  LeBron goes 33 pts, 9 assist, 9 rebounds and they say AD is definitely the MVP.
Magic Johnson deserves credit too not just Ron Palinka 🤦🏿‍♂️
Kinda feel bad for Max. He had to be on Kawhis side for the sake of arguing and this show even tho he knew that it was bs
22-    Anthony davis
KCP is so consistent, thank you KCP! Green just hasn’t hit anything but has made big plays sometimes
Britain Please watch this and than you will come to know what your ancestors were.(Britain Does owe reparations by Shashi tharoor) Note: Please  do not spread wrong messages in your schools regarding India.
This is a cake walk from the get. The specialist trying to make this seem competitive. Top two players in the NBA on one team? C’mon don’t make this seem tougher than what it is.
KP is all of us watching these two lol
Why can I hear Kendrick Perkins breathing like darth vader? First take sort it out lmao
Why they never mentione KCP  on anything?
Why can I hear Kendrick Perkins breathing like darth vader? First take sort it out lmao
Keep that same energy the term us teens use is exactly how Stephen A. explains it lmao
The producers need to tell Stephen a to stfu let the man talk.
Max is constantly backpedaling, prob gets paid to do so!
All Bron fans, please forgive Max.
Man it was a close game until the last 5 minutes relax!
Max not keepin that same energy tho💯🤣
Max doesn’t know what keep that same energy mean
I think the Heat will scrap they’re way to a win in game 5, and Lakers will finish it in 6
SAS IS RUDE
Stephen A needs to learn that you can’t over talk people because the delay. Gets really annoying I can’t watch these lately because know one knows how to wait there turn. And constantly overtalking each other with the delay!!! Just annoying.
SAS can be entertaining at times, but he's also often just a loud-mouthed interrupting annoying blabber face. At least offer something interesting of an opinion, rather than just causing unnecessary drama over a non-issue. SMH, and we all thought Molly interrupted too much for no reason...
Max actually is keeping that same energy though lol. He's using the same criteria he gave Kawhi to put on LeBron.
A thumbnail for a Lakers discussion and it wasnt Bron? Wow
Steven a and Max was in agreement for a while. Lol
Lmao i love Max
THEEEYYRREE INN TRROUUBBLEE!!!
Max kellerman did not keep the same energy lmao
That’s not what keep that same energy means😂😂😂
Jimmy is the real winner for me this year.. really.. lone superstar in his team.. gave every team the props...hatts off to you Buckets..!!🙏🏻
Stephen A really acting like he wasn't flip flopping on the clippers and lakers. At least Max can admit he's wrong.
Max has always said: Kawhi was the best, and Lebron has a chance to regain his crown.... and he did....Max said nothing wrong
Max, that isn't even the concept of keeping the same energy lmao
How tf Stephen a smith gonna tell somebody to “go ahead” and continue talking WHILE THEY TALKING
KP ain't keeping the same breathing energy today lol
Stephen A .. let the man talk .. boy you must be interrupting your own speeches at home by the looks of it.
Lakers nation, we got 1 more let's get it
SAS acting like he didn’t choose the Clippers too when the playoffs started. Everybody doubted Bron and the Lakers. Love to see LAL get this chip
SAS can we just let max finish his point? I actually want to hear what he has to say.
4:50 should’ve said IT’S MY TURN
The only time I can really take Max serious or even listen to his opinion, is when he talks about Boxing. Anything else I skip ahead
Stephen A, please shut up. Max admitted he was wrong. Plain and simple. Stephen A sounds like an old gf from a toxic relationship
Dam max was trying to admit he was wrong and Stephen a and kp bullied him 🤣
S.A.S is a delusional clown to a degree he thought that the commissioner listened to him and changed all star game based on his advice on the show😂
SAS you never admits anything-
As a casual fan of the show, I noticed earlier this year in previous videos how Stephen A. Smith had a look of disgust on his face when Max talks. I am glad Max stood up for his opinion in this video. Without knowing, but assuming there is a better personal relationship, I started watching Skip and Shannon more this year because their conversations are more fun than stressful, in my opinion. Edited (knew this before this video): I keep a can of tuna to remind myself, despite my "success."
Stephen A. just can't shut up, and Mr. AUTISTIC PERKINS coming up with his BS.  Let's see what happens game5.🤔🤔🤔🤔
Stephen A is a colossal hypocrite. Remember when he said KD made the weakest move ever, then momma Durant called him out. Ever since then, he was on KD's nuts even though clearly Lebron was better.   At least Max admitted he was wrong because of the facts laid out to him. He's acting like a 12 year old in this video interrupting Max. It's rude and pathetic.
Jimmy Butler is a superstar and as they keep saying you need 2 superstars to win a chip
Noooo max, that’s not what “keep that same energy means”. It means if you stand on a hill you gotta die on it.
SAS is a dickhead
SAS acts like he didnt switch sides before the playoffs started lol. Man said the Blazers would take Lebron to 7
Jared Dudley gonna get at least 1 minute in game 5. MVP!!!
Most over used word in ESPN “ of all time “ everything for them is something “ of all time”
The regular season is checkers.  The playoffs is chess. Rondo is built for chess. Slower pace, nerves, defense.
If the refs don’t give lebron and ad every flop heat would be up in the series..
Yea yea great performance from AD give him an Oscar from all his fake injuries during the game
If you guys are scrolling through YouTube, I ask you to stop by ShocksAndLocks!! We’re posting picks every week and the quality of videos will only improve. A simple quick click could really help us out and you might even make yourself some money!!
Max “Down With The Kids” Kellerman
GET PERK OFF TV!!!!!!!
Frank Vogel did a great job, but Jason Kidd said SOMETHING to lebron that turned that game around for him and idk what it was but I feel like it was a big factor.
Max just being logical and SAS can't comprehend logic.
Today on ESPN Stephen A goes crazy ...
I thought Davis' defense was the key last night.
Haha max does a faster transition from leonard to lebron than the lakers getting a rebound and transition to getting points
Wouldn’t be surprised if KCP gets Finals MVP
Stop comparing dwade to jimmy butler it’s a stupid comparison
bro chill with max he’s admitting he’s wrong like what he supposed to do talk abt every 5 mins RELAX
THE 🐐KING 👑 ☝ 🏆 THE LAKE SHOW
Max that isn’t what we mean
So none of these idiots talked about how the Lakers almost lost that 😂
KCP was big time lastnight. AD was great on both ends on the court💪🏽
Keep the same energy oooooooooooohhhhhhh  lol
I remember listening to ESPNLA radio 5 years ago and Max was saying Lebron was on his way down as an athlete, man always desperate to be the smartest guy in the room and always fails
Stephen A Smith act like he never say others were better than lebron but at the end of the day? Smith gave the grown back to lebron lol. I remember smith say curry was the best player in the world. I remember smith says Lillard was the best player in the world lol. Yeah max was wrong but smith ain't so innocent.
If Kawhi stayed in TOR, he’d still be the King of East & definitely in the Finals right now against Lebron
Why always compare butler to wade? Clearly wades a tier ahead..
Shut up, man!
Watching max go back on everything he said years brings joy to my life and Lebron’s 🤴🏾💪🏾💯
Stephen A is slick annoying as heck with all the interrupting
Steven A you're not a basketball scholarship you're a basketball liar
Already swept the whole west a game away from gentlemen sweeping the playoffs
They be bullying max
Geezus stfu SAS. My goodness have some manners
Learn how to breathe Kay Pee
Listening to Max Kellerman is like nails on a chalkboard every time.
Steven A and the rest of the commentators are getting worse Moment by moment day by day. How when you have two teams in the Championships and you tear one down when they played a great game but didn't win. Talking about from a superstar to just a star sad sad talk. Imma do like my dad I'm going to start putting the commentators on silent
A smith will never let this slide🤣🤣🤣
Bro SAS really gone talk through max entire turn🤦🏿‍♂️😂🤣😂
Nahh they struggled to win that game. They have 2 super-star and still lose 1 game and struggle the last one. Clearly, if Miami had other superstar like KD, they would´ve won the last game and much likely this series. Yall know that! Don't try to overrate this team, it ain't happening again
Lebron cries to refs every single play! C'mon man! I don't see any other player on the floor looking at the refs as much as Lebron.  He's whining every single time.  Play the game Bron and let the refs call the game; don't try to sway their decision.
Heat need dragic
Lakers get rid of anybody not named James, Davis, Rondo, Carusso, Howard, Morris, Pope.......
Ok imma say it  the nba title seems to run away from demarcus cousins like Wes welder and super bowl rings ...
SAS caught max in 4K
Dope performance Lakers!
Shut up Stephen A.
Hasn’t SAS gotten every finals prediction wrong since 1946?
Y’all just now realizing Stephen A NEVER admits he’s wrong
Perkins is right. Rob shut up a lot of people and he is about to be responsible for bringing Lakers another title. Although Magic got Lebron to come to LA. Still Rob still a great job of getting AD and others to put this team together.
The day you see Stephen A admit he’s wrong is the day the zombie apocalypse occurs
Does Stephen A. really want Max to spend 5 minutes talking about Kawai, when he has been home for 3 weeks? Nobody wants to hear that.
S.A.S stfu
Y'all know butler was not going to give you 40 plus two games in a row.
I love AD and he’s been big for us this season but Lebron is finals MVP
Stephen A need to grow up
Why does molly always give us duck lips?! Stupid B
Max's ability to admit when he's wrong is what makes him creditable. Skip and Stephen A. Smith could never understand
All these clowns were hating all year ..saying Kawhi made lebron look "unathletic "
they always cut off perk
Max doesn’t know what that meaning means lol
Why perk sitting like he in timeout
I miss Ryan Hollins
nba viewership is down. all hail e-sports!
I don’t care what anyone say. Danny havre men is bonified SCRUB
who's gonna be the finals mvp ?? thats what I wanna kno
Jimmy butler isn’t really that good. Let’s call it how it is. He will be a great complenary piece in Brooklyn with KD and Kyrie
Stephen A Smith's real name is Stephen A SSmith
All SAS does is yell, this was unwatchable
If Butler hits that wide open 3 at the end it’s a different game.  The Heat were right there without their best pick and roll player.  Stinks that injuries played into this series.  Dragic pick and roll is probably 40-60% of the Heat’s offense and foundation
Lololol
Y'all getting on max about stuff that don't matter 😂🥱
Not having bam and especially Dragic really messed up the heat not that they were gonna win either way lebron is on cruise control
Rob pelinka is getting way too much credit he made a lot of mistakes he signed cousins dion waiters and jr Smith all scrubs he gambled on Dwight Howard with nothing to lose after cousins got hurt and it worked out
I’m just sitting here wondering why Lebron getting all this credit for beating a crippled team that’s still mediocre even when healthy and with ZERO superstars and ONE all star with Butler. 🤷🏽‍♂️
Stephen A was out of order cutting in on Max..that was rude and unprofessional
How many times Stephen A gonna say "go ahead" while Max is talking 😂😂
Max deserves all the bullying he getting cause yes he admitted he was wrong about Kawhi, but he made lebron seem like he was WASHED
max use to be a rapper 😵
They don't talk about how KP AD and Rando are saving this Lucky Lebron James.
Stephen A you said it was a 4-0 sweep. You were wrong too, and annoying right now
Keep that same energy 😭
Stephen A after his big contract turned into an annoying wife after the honeymoon.
Agreed stephen a is annoying af
Stephen a you had your doubts !!!! I got the footage !!!
Max wasn't done clown! Stop interrupting Max when he speaking facts you trying to treat him like skip does Shannon
At least max knows how to mea culpa - SAS on the other hand.....smh
Who cares about this Terrible Finals..Just get it over with so people can stop talking about it like it’s the Bulls 98 Finals..Miami is overmatched! We all know that so people please stop making comments like their playing the Warriors or 98 Bulls
The Lakers fanbase needs to sign a massive petition to apologize to KCP for all of the grief they’ve given him. He has shown up in a big way these playoffs. Give the man the respect he deserves.
Steven A. Get em  Max,Max,  riding that bike backwards now  on Lebron !
Max good, Stephen a tripping
Jimmy is acting like a Robin instead of a Batman! There looking for this rookie Hero to do everything in the closing.
Props to Frank ? Never bro lol the guy is gifted with goat James and AD .... stop it
SAS needs to be done with this show
The Heat gave that game away in the 4th  The Lakers are good but not that good.
Agree with KP, picking up Rondo, Howard, and KCP was crucial to this team.
Stephen A is so irritating! Shut up for crying out loud!
Petition to shut Stephen A up!
Game over sorry Jimmy B u don't have enough fire power .... Sixers n Lakers next year 2021 🏆
As a Lebron fan , Lebron's biggest task will be next season facing a healthy warriors squad and a hungry clippers squad. Also if KD come  back healthy + Kyrie finally playing team basketball will be a crazy year.
I'm gonna laugh if heat comes back and wins lol
Kp acting like he didn’t hate on Kyrie and Stephen A acting like he wasn’t gawking the clippers all season🤦🏿‍♂️. At least max admit when he wrong
Its over Friday James will have 30 & Ad 35 they will go off
It’s funny how kawhi got forgotten by everyone just a a few months ago he was called the best in nba 😂
Kcp Mvp
Lakers will trade kuz and Danny green this offseason
Jimmy Butler is not a perimeter player.
Let's close it on Friday...
I don't understand how a shooter declines. Why is Danny green so bad now ? What did he break his wrist or something ?
Shut up Sephen A let people talk so annoying
“Take the fatigues off in 2K I wanna see that same energy”
It's just so ironic that now Dwight has come full circle and is going to actually win a ring with the Lakers, when he could have won one before if he got over himself while playing with Kobe and played seriously.
Hi
Max does not know what he’s saying about “keep that same energy”
Max is better than skip at least he can admit he was wrong not create two ways to be right lmao
SAS needs to control his mouth at times, he interrupted too much this time!
max trying to jump ship naw stay over there my g lol
THE MIAMI HEAT DESIGN THEIR WHOLE DEFENCE TO STOP ANTHONY DAVIS ONLY.
Might have to get a Caldwell-Pope jersey lowkey
Alright here me out: put Skip Bayless with Max Kellerman , and Stephen A. Smith with Shannon Sharpe.
It's the same disputes every single episode 🤣
Remind SAS he was wrong about Luka, every time Lukas name comes up
Max: I was wrong about LeBron.   Stephen A.: You're wrong and here's why
dont care NBA is boring now
THE MEDIA IS A BUNCH OF LIARS, ANTHONY DAVIS IS THE BEST PLAYER IN THE NBA RIGHT NOW.
Stephen A stirring up argument for argument's sake.
Its sound like an amung us lobby
Stephen A's takes on the Heat have been absolutely horrible, not sure why he is such a hardo when Max is humble enough to state when he's wrong.
I don’t understand the issue with Max acknowledging that he was wrong about Kawhi. After the 2019 Finals, any logical person would say that he was the best player in the league. And LeBron would have to prove us wrong in the 2020 playoffs. Obviously, he did. So there’s no shame in changing your opinion. SAS and KP are annoying asf
SAS needs to stfu, he’s becoming annoying like Molly.  All these guys come on the show and gang up on max just bc he’s white. Disrespect is unreal..
No max that’s not at all what “Keep that same energy” Means LMAOAOAO
If you're a Miami fan. Take great comfort in the way Miami played. Lakers played very hard and needed contribution from everybody to beat a battered heat which kept it close all night and didn't play their best at all. LeBron played great AD played great. Bam and Jimmy did not and we still stuck around. Lakers are not as good as people think. Stop watching stats and watch the game trust wat u see.
Stephen A made this segment extremely hard to watch. I couldn't even finish it
Come on I thought the best player on the championship team  was the best in the league, but only this era has changed that narrative  how can anyone in this era be considered the best in the super team  era lebron is a all time great but 4-6 just shows a question of why was he able to make it so much weak conferences and super teams and while people who are still here from the MJ era lebron will always be a debate and as time goes by another nba player will be chasing mj  because they will not have as much finals lost ..... lebron will always be debatable MJ was not we knew when be grab the best player in basketball he kept it...this is why lebron will hopefully stay top 5
Lakers are going to be the 2nd team in nba history to blow a 3-1 lead
Stop arguing y'all... U make d whole world luk stupid...8s not about lebron....8s all about kobes tribute....DIS SEASON NBA IS SCRIPTED BCOZ OF KOBES DEATH......DONT FOOL US NBA....KOBE DIED AT 41....ALL LAKERS GAME WON BY 4-1.....WHAT DA HECK.....HAHAHA
It really boring when the two max and stephen have similar opinions 😑😑
Kcp but this rondo's team
Sad cats think these playoffs are real. Smh. The agenda is real
Who’s the finals mvp Lebron Or AD ? 👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻
Kendrick Perkins: " a kooshul game 4 last night"
SAS is such a hypocrite
Lost all respect for Stephen A. after the Nash comment and White Privilege somethjng
I Love Stephen A. But Max kept it 💯
This man said “keep that same energy”😂😂😂
Y'all really gave KCP a prime AD and Lebron smh 🤦🏾‍♂️
How many times did Stephen A say that the clippers were way better than the lakers?
Max finally admitted he was wrong 🤭
That was slick How max tried that same Energy quote . You can't switch teams or your player and keep the same Energy . Stick with your guy.or team 😂 And Talk about how they played like 🗑 Trash.
At the end of the day big ups to Jimmy with two of his starters out he still got a game...bron can’t even get you a game with his two sweeps 🧹 😂  now he will be at least elevated to be named in the same breath as a Tony Parker and a Manu freakinginobli 😂🤷🏽‍♂️🖖🏽
That's why 😂😂😂
SAS big mad!!! Lol
I like how if Miami win it’s the lakers fault if Miami lose it’s also the Lakers fault when will People give Miami their props🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Danny green where is your 3 point game I don’t think he has scored one yet Morris has a better shot than him
Lay off Max Stephen A. The dude admits he’s wrong! What’s your deal?
Why jimmy butler wasn’t looking to score was beside me
Smith you are annoying...let max talk and stop this Leonard thing...you make mistakes as well
Stephen A is annoying, he telling max to continue to talk about how bad Kawhi played in game 7, WHY would he keep taking about someone who not playing ?🤨
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
cream come to the top.Magic had input on this team.
Props to Vogel for making the adjustments that will win the Finals. There’s a lot of coaches who don’t or won’t make adjustments. AD wrecked the Heats offense and he is not nearly getting enough recognition for that.
That’s not what “keep that same energy” means, Max. Stephen A needs to be checked.
I can’t believe I be watching these shows lmao.
Does Stephen A ever shut up. He just yells over everyone to try to belittle them
When we talked about James in the West . Tim duncan dirk Kobe was still playing as well..
Max's a phony
stephen a smith is getting annoying like stop coming for Max about being wrong, when doubted the lakers too
Stephen talk too much while Max talking
Sometimes I think ESPN is own by Lebron James enterprise 😀
look at how the narrative has changed from KCP building a house bricking shots in the past games to KCP building a name in Laker history. 😂😂
SAS needs to stfu when other people are talking
we need more wnba talk on here
Imagine a world where skip becomes max and admits he’s wrong
The best duo is actually LeBron and KCP. Stay Woke
Funny how more than 50% of Lakers fans were hating on KCP during the regular season.   Now they wanna suck him off 🤷🏾‍♂️
HEAT VS LAKERS  NBA FINALS 2020 🏀 Is almost done.
Danny Green be like: All White Bricks....just hit a lick...for 50 more bricks...BRICKS!!!
Lakers keeping DG next Year?
Danny green😐😰
Rondo the old vet and look like the little kid lol
It hasn't been KCP alone, Kuzma, and Green have been deadly from the perimeter.
AD don’t win finals mvp, then the voting is rigged
Stephen A talking like he didn’t choose the clippers too
Steven A Smith is the most annoying person in the world.
My goodness Stephen a is annoying
Kendrick perkin is the Giat
Jimmy Buckets is a great player just couldn't score because Anthony Davis was locking him down.. Max stick too Boxing!
LeBron's Finals 3-PT% has gone up to 34.4%. Better than Kobe's 31.4% but not where MJ's 36.8% is yet. People think MJ couldn't hit threes but he brought it out come Finals. Went up by 4%.
Max “Im wrong I admit it” Steven A “ouhh you can’t still even say Lebron name in breathe” WHAT!?!?
max is a scientist  he has his theories  but once they are proven wrong he can admit -  the fact stephen a cant see that made this embarrassing  i love the guy but - max is saying some real stuff and was able to admit he was wrong and continue   yall are so happy max is wrong your not even debating anymore  You interrupted him the whole time he was speaking and he wasnt out of bounds
Max is a weird dude. Just hold your L bro.  Like a gent.
Anybody suprised
one thing i noticed throughout the game was that the heat looked like the second guessed every time they drove to the basket. i feel like they passed up great looks in hopes of getting a better look. They looked scared to drive against AD and Lebron
How can SAS ever get mad at someone interrupting him, that’s literally all he does.
Some of the threes and baseline turnaround jumpers LeBron made were absolute daggers. I was impressed. Not his most impressive stat line but I was still impressed. One of his best Finals games since 2018 G1.
I can't wait to see Dwight Howard and ad reaction to get their ring. Nobody didn't want to pick him up now he in the finals. Kcp too. The rest of them not so much
Sometimes Stephen A is worst the Molly gesh 🙄 dude gets wayyyyy too emotional stfu let others speak.
How to he showed he the best last night against a over matched Miami!! 🤔stfu!!
Didn't realize I was watching the presidential debate
ngl this is still a win win for Miami since no one was expecting them to make the finals and plus them have cap to get a third fourth star
Kendrick Perkins always breathing into the mic like he was on the court playing with them
So SAS & Perk are mad at Max because he admitted he was wrong? Noted
Just cut out the TOs and Lakers by 10+
Jesus christ Stephen A, sthu
Steven A: I'm coming for you Max. Max: 🤷🏻‍♂️
*NBA* *Mount* *Rushmore* Michael Jordan LeBron James Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Bill Russell
Stephen a wanna dwell on Max's pick so bad smh...doesn't make for good tv
I'm a simple man.  I see Kendrick Perkins, I click away.
Can Stephen a not shut up when someone’s talking..how many times do we need to hear “go ahead, I’m gonna get chu, go ahead”.. you’re not letting them talk so why keep saying it. He’s trying to be a comedian too much
Those guys who decided not to play for the Lakers going to be so mad when everyone got their ring and they don't get one
lol its like stephen a smith and perk want max to still say kawhi is still the best. He's admitting he was wrong
AD better win finals MVP
Let me say this that kcp shot reminded me of the fisher shot where it just lit a fire for the lakers
Stephen A is always wrong like stfu Mr sources😂
IDK what happened to DG. Hes making life hard for us!
First time I wanted to listen what perk had to say
Man max .. just been saying well SA ur right lol after the whole kawhi nonsense
What a joke the heat has no one look how stack the Lakers are
Stephen A wanted smoke LMAO
Keep that same energy😂😂😂
The disrespect that max gets in this show is unreal 😴 I don’t understand how he stand SAS
In advanced analytics, Michael Jordan has 56 games with a Game Score over 40. While LeBron James only has 26. Jordan is still the all-time leader in PER. More offensively skilled. Better defender. More clutch.
AD is Finals MVP no debate honestly
stephen a flip flops like a slipper
SAS never admitted that he was wrong about the jimmy joining the heat though hahahaha
Why is Michael Jordan still the GOAT? It's not just marketing. More memorable, influential, and charismatic. Didn't cheat the process. Accomplished more in lesser time. More beautiful to watch.
Perkins be like: 😐
I think Lakers should drop Kuzma  And get someone better He hasn’t done much  Just my opinion 🤷🏾‍♂️
Why are they trying to pump up the lakers, they are clearly the better team. The heats deserve credit, the nuggets were flat out cheated. I mean, it’s like when Stephen was crediting Kevin Durant when he clearly was on a superior team. It gets silly...
Max right
I remember LeBron's 2007 ECF G5, 2012 ECF G6, 2013 Finals G7, 2016 Finals G5 & G6, and 2018 Finals Game 1. I do remember them all. Yet, I only put 2012 as his only performance among the top 10 greatest ever.
Sas...  its game 4 and the refs called only 2 fouls on the lakers in the 4th quarter.. this was either set up or refs choosing sides but either way it was some bs.. the game was close down the stretch miami was not overmatched they were poorly officiated.
Lol send skip back to espn and max to fox. Stephen a hates max and skip hates shannon
Props to MAGIC who tried to get the AD trade done last year and people cried because of who he wanted to trade! I will give credit to Rob for surrounding LeBron with some dogs, not scared of the moment!!!
Kendrick Perkins looked like an emoji the entire segment. 😯
... And no LeBron and AD are not the best duo.... Smh... Ijs
AD deserved DPOY not giannis period
Rigged the NBA is run by the Jesuit.
I'm a lakers fan, but my God I hate that danny green is going to be a champion after his shitty performance
AD defensive performance proved that he was robbed defensive player of the year.
Stephen A Smith is wrong like every other day. If max was a bully he could make a fool of SAS
Vogel needs to play howard more especially when ad is resting
I think 2nd greatest of all-time is about as high LeBron will ever reach. He just doesn't have the charisma. I mostly forgot all his game winners in the playoffs except in 09. His great games simply aren't as memorable as MJ's.
Max, that's not at all what they mean by keeping that same energy, they mean be as excited as you were about KAWHI when it's all said and done.  You transfer the energy when convenient, you didn't keep the same energy, you conveniently converted it when you were wrong
KP's laugh is epic 😂😂
Stephen A is interrupting like Molly in this segment I swear
AD>Wade
Hahahah, Max is still apologizing 😅🤣😂
Caldwell Pope, He was Forever On the Trading Block but, has Managed to Outlast many other Lakers❗He is like a Duracell Battery, Just Keeps Going and Going and Going❗KCP will get Even better after going thru this Finals because NOW, he No what it Takes to become an NBA Champion❗
Lebron is so overrated if they didn’t have AD they aint winning
Can SAS stop bringing up Max saying Kawhi was the best. We get it, Max admitted to being wrong and we move on.
Never forget that, when the Lakers hired Frank Vogel, Max got on First Take and said he expected Vogel to be fired during the season and replaced by Jason Kidd. Months later, nobody talks about him saying that.
We need a refund on Danny Green
The only way danny green can redeem himself is if he hits 6 threes in g5. Otherwise trade him for one of the many 3 and D guys who can hit an open 3.
LeBron is on the driver's seat for 2020 Finals MVP. He will break the tie with Magic, Shaq, and Tim for winning 3 Finals MVPs. Anthony Davis kinda vanished in Game 3 and most of Game 4. LeBron has been more consistent.
Didnt Stephen A pick the clippers to win?
Does anyone know what is Max's background wallpaper? Or where I could find it?
Jeez, Stephen A would not shut up this segment. Let Max talk!
Dam Max shut up
Forget Magic, Tim, Larry, Shaq, Kobe, and Wilt. The NBA Mount Rushmore that Maria Taylor wants to discuss is starting to shape itself with Jordan, Russell, Jabbar, and James.
If Jimmy Butler wants to be considered a superstar, he's got to take over games.  He was quiet in the 4th.  Keeps deferring to the young guys.
Its because Max can admit he was wrong. Stephen A cannot. Thats the difference
KCP was absolutely critical in 4th quarter, he made some big time play. And under appreciated to be honest.
Yes, KEEP THAT SAME ENERGY SAS 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Lakers need to prioritize retaining Rondo & Howard. Javale is gone and please please please get rid of Danny Green. Dude can’t even be relied on in the clutch for his defense. Straight liability.
AD and Lebron really compliment each other but I'm what also needs to be highlighted is the fact that this is the first time in Lebrons career he has a teammate on the floor who is as smart, if not smarter than him in Rondo. That's 2 high IQ players on 1 team. Of course they'd be dangerous.
Stephen A still the biggest hypocrite on tv
Big Bron💪🏿
Max did kept that same energy tho
MVPs + Finals MVPs + Rings Jordan: 17 Russell: 16 Jabbar: 14 James: 12
Stephen A is an annoying hypocrite. Acting like he’s never wrong about anything when he’s wrong almost every week
How is lebron the best player in the world when AD stats lead the lakers in every category except assist the whole season and the playoffs
It’s over
👈🏻 = 🐐 Michael Jordan won more MVPs, Finals MVPs, and rings combined in 6 full seasons than LeBron James did after 17 years... 🤣 My GOAT will always be better than your goat, Shannon Sharpe and Nick Wrong.
does Stephen know how to shut up? didn't he choose max to be on the show? does he know how to be respectful of someone else? smh
Man Steven A think no one can change their opinion Foh
LESS RIPPING ON EACH OTHER AND MORE TALKING ABOUT BASKETBALL. Sheesh.
Stephen A talks to f*@kin much
Steven A, you’re trash
I wish somebody addresses when the playoffs first started Stephen a was flopping back n forth between the lakers and clippers and when they loss to the thunder he jumped off the bandwagon. He didn’t see this happening either. I wish someone bring it up. At least Max admit when he’s wrong.
I can’t stand hearing KP talk👎🏿
Yup Frank Vog was the mvp last night... great adjustments
Can I get a like for the heat R.I.P  1 ..,2..,3, CANCUN!
JIMMY BUTLER  - changes his team every year - let’s lakers take over  - made his 1st conference finals appearance this year as the 4th best player for the Heat - can’t score over 20 points - doesn’t lead his team in any category  But let’s all act like he is a real WINNER
I bet you a week after this Finals is done this Friday, all of us will look back at this Kobid championship and shrug our shoulders and shake our head. What a bogus 2020 season that was. Had to do it to fund next year.
I'd rather listen to the dude that was wrong about LeBron when he didn't show up to the finals once but admitted he was wrong than the dude that guessed the finals results wrong 6 years in a row(less than 2% chance) and the dude that averaged 2 points and sounds like a pregnant blue whale on the mic
Is it me, or did Anthony Davis nose look hella red last game. He looked sick to me. Lebron eyes were low too like he may be sick as well. Or am I trippin
Let’s all laugh at the Heat 🤣🤣🤣 Herro and his bums thought they had a chance. Only chance you had of winning by 11 was a 15pt performance by AD, he’ll get it right in the next finals. Butler needed the game of his life to win 1 game 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Easy 4-0 next time. Miami Beat not Heat 🤣🤣🤣
Best duo in the league right now can’t no body stop AD and Lebron. Lakers from here are just getting better and better
Stephen A so annoying, Max already said he was wrong more than enough. stop acting like clown
The supporting cast was immense this game. KCP - 15 pts 2 assists Caruso - 7 pts 2 rebs and stellar defence Rondo - 5 assists 7 rebs (including some important offensive rebounds) Green - 10 pts and not forgetting markieff and kuzma too
Stephen A is getting tiring to listen to man. Race cards every other day and wont let anyone speak.
Rondo became that 3rd star the Lakers needed
idt jimmy is an all time player at all
bro let max talk. Stephen A so annoying
Stephen A is too arrogant when it comes to basketball, acting like he knows more than anyone else. Yes Max was wrong about the clippers/kawhi but he admits he's wrong. Stephen A is acting like he was 100 percent for the lakers when he was sweating and biting his nails when the clippers where beating the lakers earlier in the season.
All the calls In this game was trash Lakers complain to refs all game
How come LeBron missed the playoffs last year? Because he got hurt. Lonzo got hurt. Kuzma got hurt. So what about the Clippers? No excuses. As if Shamet, Beverley, and George were all load managing! 🤣
Finally some love for Coach V!
Max is a real man for admitting his mistake. Stephen A. and Max argument is so funny.
Hey Max u don’t really gotta keep that same energy u was wrong and that’s it
Max swallowed his pride and admitted he was wrong. What else SAS want from him?😂
Most boring finals* in a long time.   No cap
About 20%-25% of Doc's stupid and predictable plays and rotations caused the Clippers' collapse. But Steve made the right decision. Doc has accomplished nothing else except the ring Ainge helped him win.
Literally what do SAS and KP want Max to do? Talk about Kahwi when he’s not in the finals? He got behind the wrong guy. Idk why SAS and KP are acting like they don’t do the same thing all the time lol. I dont get why they try to roast him for giving LeBron his credit now. It’s getting annoying tbh
The thing is the Lakers weren’t even playing their best and they still won.
Miami heat pack your 💼
Max just be talking and has no idea what he’s saying lol
Molly: "Stephen A. Smith, talk to me about last night"  🤣
Stephen a was doubting the lakers too, he’s so annoying
Steven A Smith you have to show more professionalism. Max may have been wrong, but he sure out classed you.
What is this gentleman sweep phrase? Either it’s a sweep or it’s not..
KCP playing like he want FMVP
Stephen A Smith = Black Privilege.
As Skip keeps saying over and over, the Clippers would've beaten the Lakers in May had there never been an interruption. But what happened? Family deaths. Lou and Trezz did not play the 4th meeting and barely lost. Meant to be.
Stephen A. wants Max to become Skip Bayless 2.0 and hold onto bad takes and refuse to give the better man credit
honestly seeing max admit that he was wrong on lebron is actually  quite unreal
Lakers win when lebron and AD give you greatness and at least one other role player shows up... in this case it was KCP
Well Max apologised without saying other reason
We better waive Danny green or trade him this offseason
Anthony Davis was obviously gonna shut down Jimmy butler he’s like 5 inches taller lol why r people shocked. Still think Lebron deserves mvp
Lebron wasn't even that great last night.  He had a +/- of -2. Anthony Davis was the guy. He was +17, he hit the 3 to close the game and had the block of the night while guarding the other teams best players. There were times where the Lakers looked better without Lebron especially in the first half.  But whatever, I guess y'all watched a different game instead of the one I saw.
So noone gonna talk about how lebron missed all those 3 pointers down the stretch and pope and davis had to bail him out 😂
SAS shut up man it’s getting old
Hi haters!!! Keep doubting 🤫🐐
LeBron James would've had excuses had he lost anyway. Or a scapegoat in Kyle Kuzma. But he won't need those excuses this year. Clippers can but aren't allowed. Only LeBron's groin gets them. 😂
Lebron James in the finals have proven to be the finals MVP this year and he has been the best player in the playoffs and finals like he has always been. AD will be legendary and the lakers will win multiple championships including this years championship
Lakers not winning next year
please swap this awful guy perkins with vince carter, like its enough with stephen a
At least Max admits he's wrong. Stephen A NEVER admits he's wrong
Michael Jordan - No shorter seasons or BLM scamdemics. - No legacy-saving shots or suspensions.  - No need to tag-team with other stars. - His Finals opponents were HEALTHY.
heat in 7
perkins having a job on espn makes me think i can become preident of the united states even though im not from the us
Perk my favorite
Herro took too many wild shots. Nunn took shots period and they shouldn't have played Bam.
SAS being extra annoying in this one. let the man speak...
About time for Tyler Herro to erupt for 50. Still, Lakers in 6 and LBJ the FMVP.
People forgot KCP was a lottery pick. He’s talented.
In all honesty, Lebron is about to gain his tenth ring. He has 9 eastern conference rings and now he will have 10, with a western conference ring.
Can SAS shut up for 5 MINUTES!!!!??
STFU Steven A., stop acting like you've never been wrong before. Max messed up, we get it, now stop being a baby about it 🤦‍♂️
KP acting like he has good takes💀
Beginning of the season we go from making fun of Pope to the end of the season makin fun of Danny green 😂
It's over on Friday. No more sports 😥 (football is not my thing)
They need to replace max already.
I can't wait when Rob Parker calls LeBron James the LOAT. All LeBron haters and Laker haters sees it. COVID ruined the Clippers' motivation and chemistry they needed to create. Clippers weren't winning it with 20 games.
Lol Max admitted he was wrong about Kawhi, what more do KP & Stephen A want from him? His basketball pass?
Finals MVP is bron his 4 games are way better than AD 4 games
Vogel is not the coach, LeBron is the coach he has more experience playing finals and winning rings than the entire team
Stephen mad toxic
Max is the biggest clown Stephen A. needs to be mad at himself for putting him on the show
We still didn't forget u have Kawhi over Lebron, Max Hahahaha
Smith stfu let max talk
Lets be honest kyrie was right about what he said. If you watch this game close it was davis shot and kcp that won lakers game. I watched lebron shooting really bad and really deep steph curry threes from 30 feet and missing 3 of them badly.
Stephen A smith acting like he didn’t flip flop between lakers and clippers chose the clippers when playoffs started so annoying how he act like he’s always right when max is wrong
Perk breathing like he just got done playing in Game 4
Lebron about to capture his EASIEST championship ever. Can't hate the guy though.
Had AD and Rondo played with Bron for at least 10 years, that trio would've had lots of success.
AD finals MVP
LeBron = LOAT, Luckiest Of All-Time 2012 - Kaload management 66-game season.  2013 - Ray Allen shot saved him. 2016 - Draymond suspension. Kyrie shot. 2020 - Kobid championship.
Did molly get sunburn or a mean tan? I see no one talking bout it lmao
Danny green trash
Rondo pulling the lakers through, nobody can read defense like him
Beat them guys by like 30 nice 💯
Kobe should get a special ring with the Team. He has been such a huge part of the determination of This Team. Bron & AD have done the thing and Someone has a been great 3rd player every time. Kobe Always Remembered
Stephen A Smith: Yous was kindas hoppin
There is something that was not talked about in the NBA and it is something really strong and that is that LEBRON JAMES WILL OVERCOME MICHALE JORDAN IN RINGS, I say this because anthony davis after winning the second game said the following: `` I want to continue winning more rings with Lebron '', this means that if he signs an extension contract with the Lakers, many of Lebron will be able to shut up, especially the Jordan haters. THAT IS MY PROFESY, KEEP IT WHEN IT BECOMES REAL. REGARDS FROM DOMINICAN REPUBLIC.
King James the goat 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
I had a 3-1 lead on my ex-wife.       Now I'm paying 18 years child support times 3.
Pre-COVID Clippers > Lakers = 2-1 Post-COVID Clippers < Lakers = 0-1  Lakers barely beat us with no Lou and Trezz. More valuable than Avery.
KCP!!!! Choke City at home sick to their stomach hope the NBA open next season with Flippers vs Lakers so they can see that banner go up 😂💀
I respect max for admitting he’s wrong about lebron being the best unless like skip bayless who seems to take lines before his takes on undisputed about lebron
"He's about to gentleman sweep the Western Conference" -- LOL! He already did, Max!
Will the lakers be wearing mamba jerseys on game 5?
Lmfaooo I love this show. Stephen a smith clowning Max for being wrong.
KCP Is Playing For Most Improved Finals Player Lmao
You shouldn’t criticize Max for admitting he is wrong and agreeing with you S.A.S. Lol
Had the NBA season played out normally with no interruptions, it would be Clippers vs Bucks Finals. But unfortunately, strange circumstances happened. Helped benefit the Lakers.
The concept of “the best player in the league” switches almost every other year. When Kawhi was considered the best after last year, Lebron didn’t make it to the playoffs at all. Before that people were saying Curry. Before that, Lebron when the cavs won, and now, Lebron again. Next year when someone else wins we’ll probably crown someone else 🥱
Jimmy butler overrated
Most efficient players in nba history  1. MJ 2.LbJ 3.A D Shaq   AD is legit brons best help and teammate ever
Did Stephen a just praise a white coach??? I’m surprised he didn’t say he should be fired and a black homeless dude with no coaching experience have the job. That’s what he wants, ‘brothers’ in jobs in place of white Dudes. Don’t try and deny this FACT
Lakers should go after JJ Reddick and Harrell in the off season.
👑
Never forget that Lebron chucked fade-away threes too in the fourth-quarter like he was Danny Green and KCP combined lol
AD's defense was so devastating - i have not seen anything like it in a while
If you think Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell were the same players in the bubble than last March, then you might as convince me the real Mike Tyson showed up against Buster Douglas! 🤣
Keep that same energy 😂
Lakers for life
No disrespect to R.P but Lebron and A.D were both started by Magic Johnson (and they are the reason the Lakers are 1 win away from chip).
NBA is rigged for the Lakers or LeBron to win. COVID saved the Lakers from losing to the Clippers.
Frank Vogel is our 3rd superstar
Same energy facts 💯
Max Kellerman is a class act. Admitting when he is wrong.
Ol' GOAT James!
lmao these guys just yell like damm
what did i say? GENTLEMEN SWEEP
SAS :at least I will rest after the finals are over ESPN:we don't do that here
Always respect Max for accepting that he made a wrong assumption 🙏
All the people hating on the lakers are saying that are saying that the lakers had a cakewalk 😭😭 mfs really thought heat was gonna win this series after they won game 3 😂😂
Jimmy had a decent game on paper, but watching him last night, it seemed like he was terrible. Lots of missed shots.
lol the one time max predicts wrong and Stephen a been predicting wrong since birth he milking this sooo hard .
"Remember kids, bullying works"            -UrinatingTree
watch lebron win finals nvp.. lebron been the one keeping them in check and is ready for primetime
Wow....It's the Finals, and somehow Kawhi comes into the conversation by Max lol. He's still salty the Clippers got bounced out so early that he has to bring his name up in every LeBron debate haha.
Lakers in 7 🤣🤣
SAS shut UP bruh. All you’re trying to do is get at Max lol. He’s giving credit where it’s due. Lol
KCP is what danny green thinks he is
SAS calling out MAX lol they are just the same
always cracks me up how Max must crown everyone either the GOAT or an all time great and just can't compliment someone without doing so.
Let’s be real. AD is the teammate Lebron has been waiting for his whole career. They mesh together so well.
Kuzma is about to be traded this off season.
Molly you’re wrong and here’s why... you have no BUSINESS being on this show
AD should win finals mvp. Lakers win when he plays good. AD’s defense on Jimmy Butler was amazing, and Kawhi and Iggy both earned finals mvp for defense. AD always come in clutch too!
They need to hurry up and end with how low their ratings are but ESPN not going to talk about that.
Thank you KCP. Bullying works. Except for with Danny Green.
Stephen A. “We get all of dat!” Smith 😂🏀
AD finals MVP like if you agree
Lakers fans bullied KCP into hooping 😭
Frank Vogel has been an underrated coach all season
Like if Lakers will win in 5
A herro is a sandwich
First
Heat in 7
Like if LeBron the GOAT🐐
