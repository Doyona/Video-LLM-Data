🛠 CHECK OUT CITIES: SKYLINES 2! https://play.citiesskylines.com/schlatt 🛠 And guys I didn't die. Why are you saying rest in peace?
Absolutely NOTHING has changed
honestly if you make videos that blow up and make a lot of money, it generally means people enjoy the videos so dont feel bad about it lol
Best part about these videos is where he ranked them
NOOOOO
only 3 videos later he failed
This aged well
things didnt change
RIP Scotland, you will be missed so much🦅🎉🥳
Nothing changed…
Rip jschlagot
Capybara
Not only does water boil at 100 it also freezes at 0 . Makes more sense than 32 doesn’t it lol
TAMPERE
Shclargarabatoo
So, what changed?
2:32 Fahrenheit is based off how temperature feels for humans
It's like we can still hear him... Rip jschlatt you will be missed...
celsious is better, 0 is freezing and  100 is boiling
What even was the point of this video, to gaslight people? Lol
He will be remembered RIP💀💀💀💀
Missed you kshlogooat😅
Bonk
I am seeing no change big guy. Where is the change big guy?
Farenheit being better than Celsius is DULUUUUSIONAL 😂
1:04 hmm.. he really did run out of money
It’s a shame that Schlatt has passed 😔
Jambo Waifu Cup When?

Rip schlonk you will be missed🕊️
RIP schlatt Homie did have some good points about Fahrenheit though.  Celsius is good for science but Fahrenheit is good for people. Celsius can tell you when water boils. But Fahrenheit reflects how it feels to us outside. 100° is a big number, And it feels very hot. If a number is close to zero, that is a very small number, and it will be so fucking cold outside.  What I hate about Fahrenheit though is the same thing I hate about clocks, when you ask someone what time it is and they say it's half past whatever, just tell me the damn time. Sometimes I'll ask how cold is it, and people say oh it's 20 below freezing, it's like bitch just tell me it's 12° outside
rip schlondermonflamburger (i remember what you pulled in 2004)
I’m so sorry I’m late to hear your passing, it’s almost like I still hear him being gay, I miss you so much Schlagzeug❤️
Things did not change at all.
This did not age well
simpler times it was when he was still with us.
RIP Schlock 19. You will be missed
People have been saying "oh he's doing reaction videos again 💀"  but he said the only reactions he's going to be doing are submissions.... and that's what he's been doing. Submitted videos. Give the guy a break
You lasted two videos before going back lmao.
This didn't age well
This didn't last long.
I feel like this new trend is gonna last for years and years to come bye bye Schlatt reaction videos HELLOOOOO innovation😤😤🔥🔥🔥🔥
rest in peace <3 🚬
Schlagg has the children locked away...
shackle has the children locked away...
I’m very happy you are back from prison we can finally watch your new content
nothing changed💀
We will all miss you schlagt🍷🕊️
OH YEEEAAAAHHH
Godamit I miss you everyday and nothing has changed
It’s been 69 days and 420 hours since he left us, he couldn’t beat his gargalon diagnosis. I can’t believe he’s no longer with us. Rest in peace schitstain, you will be missed 🕊️🕊️
RIP you and lynja will be missed
We will always miss you shart 😔
Shallots you'll be missed
this is the most down to earth video i think ive ever seen

We are water schlatt yes, majority water
2:30 YES! YES YOU LITERALLY FUCKING ARE! ABOUT 60% to 70%! 60% of you will fucking BOIL at 100°C and freeze at 0
I can't believe he is pregnant...😮
I watched every video but the tiktok reacting ones thank god!!!!!
R.I.P Schlatt, it’s truly a shame what happened. I haven’t stopped crying since I heard the news. You will be missed. </3
i am shlocked!!!!!!!!!!!!! i am australian and you say that about the way my degrees are!!
RIP schliddydiddie, I’ll miss you, forever in our hearts, some people are so disrespectful, using AI to remake schladdys face and voice SMH
Schlatt what did you do that THE GOVERNMENT won’t let you leave the country
I came back to this years later its almost like hes still alive but his memory and legacy lives  Rip Shligger
WHY YOU GET ARRESTED?!?!?!?!?
Rest In Peace, brother.  Also, Fahrenheit and Celsius are both shit.  0° should be freezing temperature, and 100° should be fever temperature.  The fact that -32° is the same in Celsius and Fahrenheit is just pointless.  Kelvin is universal, but I don't think we're ready to be Kelvin people.
i just noticed how in schlatts thumbnails, he got progressively sadder until this video.
2:02: Congratulations, sir, you have just uttered the words which are fundamental to anger each and every person currently living on the European continent, or, perchance, even the entire world, with the excepion of the South and North American continens.
Fly high jshart <3
RIP 🕊️ sclogg survived his 50 years in prison but the TikTok got him

Ok yeah, yeah. But i'm sorry, WHY IS THERE TAMPERE IN SKYLINES 2!?
Rip jshatt 💙
2:18  no use kelvin be smart
Dear Shlaq,  I want to let be known of this messege to you as I among others on this social media platform can agree to. Now, you may not see this and, if so you may not care but I and many others do not completely enjoy your end to the reaction of memes. We like the comedy that takes place and it is fairly hard to find in other places. I genuinely hope that, later on in your career, you may revisit this trend and satisfy our needs to your comical ability to form an audible chuckling of joy known as, laughter, from our vocal cords. Now, I may not be completely caught up with the schlugg lore, but what i do know is that you're stopping those perfections of videos that you have effortlesly discarded into the bin of shame. And since im not caught up, i don't know what kind of online media you will be performing currently, or periodically. And if this statement reaches you, please, under no circumstance ignore this request as, many of those when *if* they see this would hope for you to apply to my request. I mean this with all regards of disrespect to your made decision and am glad that you followed through with what you wanted to achieve, but out of my selfishness and many others, please bring back the meme reactions. If you tend to my needs by pluging in my source to your visual media it would be much appreciated if you were to carefully and thoroughly consider my protest. If you respond, to so in a refined and proper manner as shown in my query. With all due respect I dont appreciate your decision very much but that is my personal opinion. Have a good day and a good 2024 Mr. Schlatzenegger.  Sincerely~  Julien R*******
You know what? I appreciate how straight forward schlatt always is with the grinds. Stay baller king
"Things are gonna be a lot different tomorrow.."
It’s only been 3 months but it feels like it’s only been 20 minutes fly high Schlatt
Rip Shlong the Moe lester You touched many lives ❤
Bro 0 Celsius is 32 or 34 farenhight so using that logic 0 + 0 celsius is equal to 64 or 68 farenhight
how tf does fahrenheit make more sense than celsius? Freezing temperature of water: Celsius - 0 degrees, Fahrenheit - 32f, where the fuck did the 32 come from
Schlible
Rip schartt you will be very missed
9/11 is Hiroshima & Nagasaki as well as the big bang and the heat death of the universe, in Minecraft of course!

If the ephedrine or pseudoephedrine isn't already in pure powder form, then it must be separated from the tablets of cold medicine that contain it. To do this, the cold medicine tablets are mixed with a solvent and the solution is then filtered and exposed to low temperatures to separate and remove the inert material of the tablet. The pure pseudoephedrine is then mixed with red phosphorus and hydriodic acid. The red phosphorus is then filtered out (and later reused), and the remaining acid is neutralized by adding a lye solution. A substance is added that will bind to the meth, and the liquid meth is then drained out. Hydrogen chloride gas is bubbled through the liquid meth, making it a crystalline hydrochloride salt. This is poured through a filter cloth, and the meth that is left on the filter is then dried. Once dry, the meth is "stepped on" (mixed down with inert filler in order to maximize profits), weighed and packaged for shipment or sale.
Celcius makes much more sense because freezing is zero comparired to 32 or something idk
Wow, you can actually fix san fran sisco in this game. You can't do that irl.
what’s your opinion on shreddies cereal
"Schlatt" stopping the reaction videos out of principle is amazing considering his lack of principles in 1999.
Rest In Peace
you should watch australlias deadliest animals
rip shrimp
Awh what Schlatts dead?? Rest in peace big man 🕊️
Rest in piece Shat 🕊️🕊️❤️🪦
Rest in peace, shaft, it was great hearing you sing in heaven. I know god must have challenged you, but now you are god, so it’s all good. Rest well, and sing on. 🕊️

40 Fahrenheit is 0 Celsius and bro is trying to say Fahrenheit makes sense 😂
finally
Loved this AI render, it's like he's still here 😭🕊Miss you schlatt, rest in peas💯💯
I’m living in your walls…
I’m living in your walls…
I’m from England - (yeah I know ‘boooooooooo’ ‘your country sucks’) - and the entire Celsius system is based around water and it’s so pointless, it’s infuriating
It’s almost like he’s still here 😢😢🙏🏻🙏🏻
RIP Jschlatt. We will miss you very much. I’ll come see your grave soon. Ima miss you so much 🥹 🕊️
Rest in peace shlink

Have a good life in hell (or maybe heaven? Doubt it) U will be missed Jlott! 🙏🙏
Schlong has a point. Celsius is okay for say, cooking and shit, like making your shitty potato skin soups. For the weather? If you tell me it's 30 out and it's actually 86 farenheit i'm sucker punching you in the trachea. Farenheit is LITERALLY 1 - 100 on the cold - hot scale. They can and do teach us this shit in kindergarten because of how easy it is to understand and use. Good luck trying to tell apart the thermometers you use for cooking and for sticking up your ass when you get sick and die because YOU CAN'T FUCKING TELL WHAT TEMPERATURE IT IS.
the tokyo lens reference LMAO
Rest in peace 🙏🏼 🕊️ this AI is really getting to believable… it’s like he’s still here with us😢
I was scared for a second that reaction content was gone, but then he said he'd start doing it on stream with reddit submissions. Love it. I for one like very few reaction YouTubers, but Schlatt is one of a very small list of exceptions
RIP schlatt...
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
i looked at your reddit a year ago, WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE CLOTHING REACTION VIDEO
Yes, I am water.
Will he still be reacting to his subreddit stuff?
2:03 his first L 😔
Rest in Peace schlagu

R.I.P jschlatt you will be missed ❤😢
Rip Schlatt been rewatching all videos from the first he's posted that's still up. ( to bad he had to remove the first ones for 'violence' 'gore' 'blood' and such. ) but its hard because after a while I began sobbing knowing he'll never upload again. I got a plushie and am so glad I did it's very comforting when I'm mourning. I always expect to get a notification for Schlatt uploading but it never arrives. I hope he rests in peace. Tommy's response to this situation has been sickening. I can't believe he'd actually log into Schlatt's accounts and start posting comments impersonating Schlatt. It's to bad by now God has already has been proven not the strongest being been defeated just a bit over a year ago but I'm sure he'll be happy up there if he made it up there.. Sorry for rambling I'm just very distraught by this lose.
RIP 🪦 BIG BOY MR SCHALLEN. WE TRULY HAD A BIT OF NEED FOR YOU IN THIS WORLD 🕊️ 🕊️ 🕊️ 🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🐁🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️

Rip shlaky you will be missed but can I come to the funeral? 🫥
Where’s the shlanket
It takes its toll
Rest In Peace, shat. I’m not gonna miss you.😢😢😢
The Celsius vs Fahrenheit debate ultimately tilts in favor of Celsius based on three points: 1) The simplicity of the Celsius numbers being mapped to the melting and boiling points of water; 2) It's better suited for science; 3) It's already everywhere.
I am 70% water. YES I AM WATER YOU SCHMUCK
Rest in peace shlott. You will be missed.
Bros hair is thinning
Nice sideburns bro
fly high schlart ❤️ 🕊️
R.I.P schlatt😢  may you rest in peace 😔
Play more mincraft
We're overdue for a video, Schitt. Gotta be quicker than that buddy
The choice between Celsius and Fahrenheit often depends on personal preference and regional conventions. However, there are several reasons why Celsius is considered better in certain contexts:  Simplicity and Base-10 System:  Celsius is part of the metric system, which is based on powers of 10. This makes conversions between units more straightforward than the Fahrenheit system, which uses a different scale and has a less intuitive reference point. Scientific Standard:  Celsius is widely used in scientific and international contexts. It is the standard unit for temperature measurement in most scientific research, making it easier for consistency and global communication. Water's Freezing and Boiling Points:  Celsius is based on the freezing and boiling points of water, where 0°C is the freezing point and 100°C is the boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure. This makes Celsius more relatable to everyday experiences, especially in terms of weather and cooking. Global Standardization:  The majority of countries around the world use Celsius as their standard unit for measuring temperature. This global standardization is particularly useful for international communication, travel, and trade. Alignment with Other Metric Units:  Celsius aligns well with other metric units, fostering a sense of cohesion within the metric system. This can simplify calculations and conversions when dealing with different units of measurement. Ease of Mental Calculation:  Celsius temperatures often lend themselves to easier mental calculations. For example, it's easy to determine that 20°C is warmer than 10°C, whereas the equivalent Fahrenheit temperatures (68°F and 50°F, respectively) may not be as immediately apparent. While Celsius may be considered better in certain contexts, it's essential to acknowledge that familiarity and personal preference play a significant role in the choice between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The transition between the two systems may take some adjustment, but the advantages of Celsius are particularly notable in scientific and international settings.
Run out of money yet?
Fly high big guy fly high

Not gonna lie, all the way back to your fake tiktok reactions, your acting needs some work, its starting to remind me too much of SuperShittySniperWolf level of acting, especially those "hot takes" which are totally real and not meant to bring attention and interaction, its kinda bleh tbh

Schlatt I’m in World History class right now and apparently the Catholic Church used to sell pardons for sins. Based on what I know about the incidents in 1999, I would advise checking if they still do that.
Man, I miss Schlatt. He'll be forever remembered❤🕊🕊🕊

This is such terrible news. This is so that Jay Gaylord Schlatt passed away... Life truly takes the best people, i hope your family members can recover soon. God bless 🙏

rip shlart we will miss you fly high
RIP Schlorge Washington, we miss you 🕊️🕊️🕊️😊
I respect this. I kinda hate watch reaction content. Like I know its trash and I shouldn't watch it but it just gives that small dopamine hit I need at 1am. 99% of reaction content is trash but there are some people that are able to do it well and its more because their community makes it good or the content creator is just funny. The only 2 people I know that have done react content well are Schlatt and PayMoneyWubby. Wubby though is different as its his community that makes things great.
Rip big buy. So sad to hear you're no longer with us
I love that I agree entirely with Schlack on the metric system and imperial system
Bro did that thing again where he says he's gonna change and dosen't.
We will all miss shlut
Rest In Peace Jschhit, you will be missed. Thank you for half a decade of awesome videos for us to look back on 🥲🥲

Celsius is smaller numbers, prefer looking at that.

Rest in peace schalt we will always miss u

Honestly understandable lol. He saw what was trending, did it, made bank, and moved on. And we got good content out of it :) its a win for everybody
We miss you Shart. Rest in piece
I swear every 6 months the schlatt cinematic universe reboots because he has been sucked into the lure of yet another infinite money glitch forcing him to do something for way longer than he enjoys
Fly high schlatt 😭

So sad for the loss of shclatt. He was such a great creator. Fly high Schlatt! You will be missed early ❤ 🕊
I have come up with an amazing idea, we should just make it to where 10 * a unit is just the next unit, and then 10 inches would be a foot, 10 feet is a yd and so on then we can try to americafy a bunch of other European things after that. Ya know, compromising.
Bro I saw Ludwig new video of drifting and bro you cooked it up bro how
Love you Schultt. Rest in pieces 🕊️🕊️🕊️

rest in peace Schlut, you will be missed   🕊
Schlatt says "We're not water!" about F vs C, not knowing water was part of defining zero Fahrenheit as well. Zero Fahrenheit is what the lowest temperature one scientist could conveniently attain in his lab. Celsius is based on water, 100 degree is boiling, 0 degree is freezing, humans are 60% water. What makes more sense?
RIP Schlagner
a lil sad and a lil happy
Why is this sponsored by tinder. Schlaft are you getting sad and feeling left out again?
RIP shat.. fly high sjat
man said "things are about to change" and then stopped posting
*"Are you water?"*  Whelp... Technically.... I'm 60% water, so i'm more water than not?
I WANT MORE CITY SKYLINES CONTENT 🗣️
schlibble
Slinle
Back with the streak after a long time day 17 of asking shlatt what he did April 9th 1999
Love you man :) we'll support you :D I live for your other content as well
It is so sad that "jschlussy" died due to overdosing on penis enlargement pills.
dope
Yo said things were about to change but it’s been a solid couple months.
Guys… things didn’t change
So your still doing the reaction videos? Then when are you gonna do more of those?
I stg post already
What is this inside joke within this comment section about schllatt being dead???
And then doesn’t upload for 2 months
Its unbelievably hard to take in the death of sir schlizzle schlangabang the third. These videos were truly something. Fly high shank Shapiro. 🕊️🕊️🕊️
It isn’t the same without him. Rest in peace 🕊
bro i just look at how meny bubbles are there😋
Hey can the next viewer submission vid be like the veiwers talents and stuff
just like real cali
CELCIUS BETTER 0-6: winter cloths 7-11: wear some hoodies 12-20: go outside in normal clothing
dude youre a lunatic if you think farenheit is better than celsius!!  0 water freezes 100 water boils like cant get a much better more simple method of measuring temp. you yanks are off it
Truly disgusting, that some “people” would do such a horrible thing
rest in pieces slinky:(
3:08 Martincitopants did it.
To everyone who likes celsius more Fahrenheit has more accurate temperature readings due to the temperature increments being smaller so L he’s right
This is just average living in cali idk what everyone on about
things have been about to change for 2 months now jschlong. you guilty about '99?
Anyone ever tell you that you look similar to Ahuevo?
Things are about to change: *2 months later* nothing has changed
Bro my bithday was on October 24th
fly low shit 🕊️
Schlibble
Schlibble.
The thing that’s changed is no more uploads
Rest in pee, shat 🕊️🕊️

F*CK U - CELSIUS GANG
Schleets ghost commented you guys ❤🕊️🕊️😢
I just witnessed someone stealing a traffic cone :)
Schatt is so ohio sigma skibidi
YES! QUALITY SCHLATT PASSION PROJECTS ARE COMING BACK BABY
No disrespect to Jschlatt, I think he's cool but censorship on YouTube has gotten so bad that even he's forced by the algorithm to water down his humour and be painfully unfunny not by choice but rather by force, or else get demonetized or permabanned from the platform because everybody who has even the slightest amount of power has to be a bitch to the system and the new world order. Anyone else feel that way? This website is a sad remnant of what it used to be.
Goodbye sholt🕊️🕊️🕊️
I hope blort didn’t drop the soap in prison
Wideschlatt
chat, is schlatt actually bald.
R.I.P. Schlagg
I think reaction content was definitely best when it was fan submitted and fan created. Really felt like a connection was made between "Shlart" and his community.
bye bye jscum... u will be missed
Are you dead?
"Last live 3 months ago"
Is there a way I can get my money back for the schlanket? The support email address is "not found" and I'm lost at this point. I've read that they will still be shipping eventually but I'm over it at this point lol. Any help is appreciated 🙏
2 months
ok schlorg
Rest In Peace.
His crimes finally caught up to him. It's been too long since '99 but they finally got him
Praise the Sun! I love the dark souls reference
I never really enjoy reaction content but the stuff Schlatt does with other creators is awesome, also I’m sure managing your own company is hard work. Do whatever you want shclatt we are here!
Rip
R I P..❤..😢
Gonna miss the schlatt vids. RIP BOZO.
Rest in Peace, Schlurt. Fly high 🕊
Rest in peace Shlartin Luther King
Can’t believe it a twitch streamer that is not a dumb ass …. It is crazy !!!! It is truly tragic for this reason that he was taken from us so soon! 🙏rest in peace big John, you will be missed
thank you for addressing this, finally something else coming
Still waiting for things to change btw
Schlatt: Things are about to change  Also schlatt: Doesn't upload  Ig bro really did die ☠️
NOTHING CHANGED
R.I.P Shat 🕊🕊🕊🕊🕊.
The crimes of Schlatt  1972:  -Brutally assaulted two woman with a hook under the names (Hook Line and Sinker, The Fisherman, or most commonly known as The Hook Man)  1999:  -Killed up to 3-5 people with a knife under the name (Mr. Knife)  -Brutally slashed a 12 year old after luring her into the forest under the name (Blade Runner)  -Committed murder with a maraca under the name (Maracaman)  -Brutally murdered 7 woman with his steel toe Timberlands under the name (Steel Toe)  -Brutally murdered 5 people with a baseball bat  -Committed mass homicide with a sword in a public establishment (up to 10-15 people dead and 20 injured)
who cares about your happiness big guy i want unhinged tiktoks
Guys I think he lied
BstChld vs Schlatt needs to happen
Rip Scoggle, we barely got to see you and your beautiful scougglish face. 🔥✊🤘🕊️🕊️
Celcius is easy to understand because 100 is boiling and 0 is water freezes to ice. What about farenheight makes sense? NOTHING (that i know of)
Can't wait for the new vids
WHOO! I am very excited about this, I love the reactions but I would LOVE more gaming videos! They're very enjoyable.
wen are you going to strem agein
RIP jshlatt died on October 24th at 7:14 am due to natural causes 😔😔😔
one month ago
Celcius is SO MUCH better than Fahrenheit and it just makes so much more sense
letsgooo when I first discovered shlatt I couldn't stop laughing. Then he started just doing reaction videos and I got bored. That's just me but I'm glad he's gonna stop doing reaction videos.
RIP JSchlatt he was hit by a drunk driver and killed tragically while helping an old grandma with her box.
Rip jayshart
schlatt really will do anything then get a normal job huh? poisoning his mind with tik tok till depression even.
I still cant believe Shat had to die like that. He didn't deserve what happened to him in the 99'. Fly higher than when you flied with the plane. rest in pieces of the plane Jslut...
Rip schlot so sad he died of natural causes😢💔

we were not responsible for what happened in the UK on september 8th 2022.
"Jschlatt", this stream changed my life. My entire view of everything that exists in this world, in fact, even in the entire universe. I can never look at anything I know the same way again. This stream represents emotions that most humans could never understand. But I can. Thanks to this stream I was awakened to many things previously considered unimaginable. Thank you, "Jschlatt" for this exquisite stream.
Shlatty
Can’t believe schlatt died of ligma, you will be missed
So sad that “Schlatt” has passed away. Rest in peace🕊️🕊️🕊️
R.I.P Schlatt your passing will not be missed. How am i gonna tell my big booty ass moma who divorced my dad thinking she could bang you about this 😢
All jokes aside, i really hope Schlatt comes back soon. I love his videos so i really want too see what new content he's been cooking up.
ALRIGHT! Its been good with the tiktoks but it really needed to end. So, im glad that its changing.

Things are about to change in 2024
as someone who has been posting on youtube since 2018 and never really going anywhere i can say i know why i dont get many views. I dont milk all the trends and all that like others do. i prefer to do what i love because youtube and twitch are a hobby for me. i wish i had more views but i dont want to abuse the system and trends and post low effort videos or streams when its something i dont enjoy.
Hey schlatt I dont watch you often but still enough to know who you are and what you do but this might come oit of context but I think your hot. Well not you you but my BF looks alot like you so yeah idk just subed im maybe going to watch you now or something like that have a nice day.
I am Mr Hands
RIP… Can’t believe Jashsalt “died” October 24, 7:13 AM of natural “causes,” fly high big guy ”🕊️”  Edit: forgot the quotation marks
You were a good man schlong😭 R.I.P Died the 24 of october...😢
post plz
omg he started the israel palestine war!
Blud said this and went missing for a month
The Celsius (also known as Centigrade) and Fahrenheit temperature scales are two commonly used systems for measuring temperature, and both have their own merits. However, there are several reasons why Celsius is often considered a better choice in many scientific, practical, and international contexts. Here are some of the key reasons why Celsius is preferred over Fahrenheit:  Simplicity and Consistency: Celsius is based on a logical and straightforward scale where 0°C represents the freezing point of water, and 100°C represents the boiling point of water at standard atmospheric pressure. This scale is highly consistent, making it easier to understand and work with, especially in scientific and educational settings. In contrast, the Fahrenheit scale is more arbitrary, with its zero point (-40°F) not as intuitive.  International Standard: Celsius is the standard temperature scale used in most countries worldwide. It is the primary temperature scale in science, engineering, and the International System of Units (SI). This international consistency simplifies communication and data exchange across borders, which is crucial in today's interconnected world.  Easy Conversion: Celsius to Kelvin (another common temperature scale) conversion is straightforward, as both scales have the same incremental size (1°C = 1 K). This simplifies temperature calculations in scientific research and engineering applications. Fahrenheit to Rankine conversion, on the other hand, is less intuitive and can be confusing.  Human Comfort and Weather Reporting: Celsius is often preferred for everyday temperature measurements because it aligns well with the temperature ranges that humans commonly experience. For example, 0°C is the freezing point of water, which is relevant for weather and daily activities. In Fahrenheit, these values are less intuitive, making Celsius a more practical choice for weather reporting and public understanding.  Consistency in Scientific Research: Celsius is widely used in scientific research, particularly in fields like chemistry, physics, and biology. The simplicity of the Celsius scale makes it easier to work with in experimental setups, data analysis, and scientific publications.  Environmental and Energy Efficiency: Celsius is more conducive to discussions related to environmental issues and energy efficiency. It aligns with concepts like climate change, where even a few degrees of warming are significant. Celsius makes it easier to convey the impact of temperature changes on the environment and energy consumption.  Educational Benefits: Teaching temperature using the Celsius scale is more straightforward, as it is based on a clear and easily relatable reference point (the freezing and boiling points of water). It is also simpler for students to grasp the concept of temperature on the Celsius scale.  In summary, while Fahrenheit has its historical and regional significance, Celsius is often considered a more practical and widely adopted temperature scale. Its simplicity, international standardization, and alignment with fundamental scientific principles make it a better choice for various applications, including scientific research, international communication, and everyday use.
I can't believe he's been gone for almost a year already. Rest in piece Jshaft. You will not be remembered in our hearts. ❤️🕊️🔥🔥
Rest in piss shlit 🕊🕊
rest in peace schouth korea, youll be missed.
Unsubbing for NNN be back in a month RIP schlungus
Honestly, good on you Schlatt. You're not happy with how things are, so you're changing them. It takes guts to do that, especially if you're a public personality.  Looking forward to whatever you make next big guy. 👌
Why this man look like he served on the uss indianapolis and now hunts sharks for a living.
Schlatt, you ran over a family of 5 In a stolen Tesla, fortunately you finally came out of prison. At least you didn't assault a bakery dressed up in a Counter-Strike cosplay. Like that time you killed 13 people in an armed rampage back in 99'
It has been foretold that he will leave for many moons and returns a new man better than the last
soda/drinks tier-list when?
Finally!
Going to miss the reaction vids but going to love new vids
Schlatt, I'm too fucking dumb to remember the temperature of boiling water otherwise
RIP Schitler... fly high bud. Your budget content looked worse than what u did in 99.
So glad you're back Big Daddy schlatt 🙏

Test in piece Schlatt we miss you..
Alright my brothers I have been here for a while it's now day 16 of asking shlatt what he did April 9th 1999
Man what the hell is with fly high I almost balled out seeing all the fly high comments 😭😂
Rip…
He posted this on the queens death anniversary
Rest in peace 🫨
Imo I think that the gaming, ranting, and ranking vids are better. Cuz as good as the reaction vids are they do just feel like taking content from other people imo
We will miss you, shirt... fly high 🕊
Atleast he didn't become ssStalkerWolf
but the upload schedule sure hasn't changed
RIP shleartt. Wishing you all the luck dealing with the big man in hell where you are after the incident
Bro in the thumbnail:🤔
Gud that he was in prison
Still waiting for things to change
We miss you, shit.
People saying hes dead XD
Apparently you and me look alike….
fahrenheit better than celsius? my friend my friend sorry we dont measure our height in eagle abortions per coconut.
Zero is the freezing point also.   Celsius is a system for efficient people.  Imperial is for idiots who also think gender is an outfit.  See the current state of North America.
its okay big guy
I will miss you
saw this one coming for awhile now; glad you’re moving onto stuff you wanted again :o]
Noooooooooo
IS HE DEAD OR NOT?
The reaction streams put me to sleep everynight.
Rip 🕊️   Passed away 24th of October 2023 at 7:13am of natural causes.
I just think of how similiar you sound to an infamous heister..... See you in prison Dallas "Schlatt".
We all miss you, ttalhcs.. fly high 😢😢
Heya jschlatt, how are you doing? I panicked when people were saying you were dead and im glad its not true- hope everythings going well! Have a good day/night! 😀😆    (I know he wont see this but leave me alone TvT)

And taking the Queen in this game in england recently was just brilliant. Rest in Peace Big Guy. (Sorry for bad englisch i grew up mit celsius)

Finally we got him!! Karma hits hard huh shmog my mother told me about ‘99 despicable! Pig🫵🏻
Man you finally got out of prison for what you did in 99
The results have determined that this was a lie. Rest in piece, Big Guy

I was looking at the title and thumbnail and wondering if his hormones are changing and growing
Celsius is widely regarded as a superior temperature scale when compared to Fahrenheit for several compelling reasons. First and foremost, Celsius, also known as the Centigrade scale, is more intuitive and universally adopted. It is based on the freezing and boiling points of water, with 0°C as the freezing point and 100°C as the boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure. This simplicity makes it easier to understand and apply, especially in scientific and educational contexts. In contrast, the Fahrenheit scale, devised by Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit, lacks this inherent logic and is based on less intuitive reference points, with 32°F for water's freezing point and 212°F for its boiling point.  Furthermore, the Celsius scale promotes consistency and precision. The Celsius degree is of equal magnitude throughout its range, making it straightforward to perform arithmetic operations. This consistency is invaluable in scientific research, engineering, and meteorology, as it allows for more accurate and easily interpretable data analysis. Fahrenheit, on the other hand, employs irregular degree increments, which complicates calculations and data comparisons.  Another compelling argument for Celsius's superiority is its global acceptance. Most countries outside of the United States employ the Celsius scale for weather forecasting, temperature measurement, and scientific research. This international consensus facilitates communication, simplifies travel, and promotes a global standard for temperature reporting.  Celsius is also well-suited for everyday life due to its alignment with temperature-based decision-making. In Celsius, temperatures are more closely linked to our daily experiences, making it easier for individuals to make weather-related judgments, such as dressing appropriately for the conditions or adjusting thermostats.  In conclusion, Celsius offers a more logical, consistent, and globally recognized system for measuring temperature when compared to Fahrenheit. Its intuitive reference points, mathematical simplicity, and alignment with real-world experiences make it a superior choice for a wide range of applications, from scientific research to everyday life. This global consensus on Celsius's adoption underscores its advantages and reinforces its status as a more practical and effective temperature scale.
Its almost like hes stil here with us.
Rest in peace "Schlatt" ❤️
a year rolled down my cheek. i was so emotional that i almost sharted. rest in peice jshart. fly high🕊️❤

"Shcphincter" is very epic ngl
Schlatt, this stream changed my life. My entire view of everything that exists in this world, in fact, even in the entire universe. I can never look at anything I know the same way again. This stream represents emotions that most humans could never understand. But I can.  I have been able to unlock my true potential due to this stream and I owe my life life to you. I feel and see things no other being can sense. I am feeling things unimaginable to the human brain. Thanks to this stream I was awakened to many things previously considered unimaginable and my brain can comprehend things that others cannot. Thank you for this exquisite stream, I will never forget this experience.
Yo! Just passed you in Tokyo a few hours ago! Hope you're having a great trip
I don't know how degrees work you expect me to know Celsius?
I remember What you in 99. I remember it all. I know where you live. I know what you did.
I’m very very sad to see the tik tok videos go right after I got into them and binged all of them in a row
JSchalt loves city skylines just like the white girl that bought a 3 thousand dollar pc just to play it
You should do more openTTD!!!
Rest in piece, shit 🕊🕊🕊🕊 fly high ✈️⬆✈️⬆

NO BRING BACK THE REACTION SERIES I LOVE IT
Bring back the OK Computer series/song analysis videos please
In Celsius, 0 is the temperature at which water freezes, you know... the most important thing for us to measure temperature wise, I get that you grew up with fahrenheit but seriously it's just as bad as all the other American measurement's, completely useless and outdated, you only use it to be "yeehaw, freedom" and I respect that, but don't show your shame to the class and act like it's a medal.
I want to see schlatt and carson collab again
rest in piece, schlongster. sometimes feels like your still here. you were alaways a great guy, even what you did in ‘99. RIP fly high schlatshlongster shilgter slhgach🕊️🪦
Is it just me or does he look like Quincy the fisherman from Jaws?
I aint up for the °C vs F debate but if anyone unironically uses kelvin day-to-day i'd escort them to an insane asylum
He actually smiled lesser and lesser in every thumbnail of those TikTok react vids LMAO
ok cool but could you do a soda tier list
That tiktok shit actually made me unsubscribe. Glad to see you're back
Hes a FUCKING LIER RAHHHHH
When?
Day 5 of asking shlat what he did April 9th 1999
What’s shcllap done now
glad to know that AI is here to help us with the loss of our dear Jshat ❤️🕊️
Jschlatt  Who cares about water boils at 100C are you water Me: well yes Jschlatt: shut up you 🤓 Me: 👶🫡
Fly high Schlunk, I'll miss my favorite creator.
Man said things are about to change and just stopped uploading 😂
is he still in texas?
His schaat likes to go up
MORE WII GAMES PLEASE
I am so upset but I’m glad he finally got peace in his life ❤ rest in peace big guy 😢
Shagg, I'm gonna be honest. I didn't watch a single fucking one of your reaction videos and I don't care about them, because you don't either. Create shit that you want to create. If it's not fun, don't do it. You've heard this a thousand times by now but seriously.
The AI of Shat is just so impeccable. They captured his essence perfectly. Fly high man 🐓
Sat dead. Big news sad moment 2030 💯

Glad you're back! Missed you big guy, mental health is hard
Day 4 of asking shlat what he did April 9th 1999
It's so sad that right after this he was caught in the crossfire between a neo-nazi white supremacist at a 7/11 with an ar-15 and beretta m9 shooting at SWAT team. Schlatt was innocently walking Jambo and was lit up with bullets, being killed at the scene of the crime.
schlatts increasingly sociopathic thumbnails on those videos is me as each day goes by. rip schloptt. 🕊️
9/11.
ill miss him so much i still watch his jackbox videos whenever i feel down :( o7 RIP big man make hell laugh cuz we all know u aint going up

I miss this guy so much, I even remember when we did the funny thing in 1999 😢 R.I.P fly high Schlander 🕊
You should make whatever content makes you happy. It's often hard to keep the line between passion and obsession. We want to create things out of joy but end up becoming obsessed with making something that fits arbitrary goals that aren't sustainable.
Buddy plz send my merch it’s been almost a year and I’m out $95 cad and ur support team won’t respond
You are so brave schlugnut
so sad 😥👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹
Can't believe shlatts back from being found out for what he did in 99
When i discovered your channel i was like "this must be comedy gold" and then i sall all those reaction videos and i thought "okay this is pure shit" and after 1 month I see this video and the old ones and im glad to see it wasnt just a cash making content channel (sorry for the bad england)
fly high shleeee🙏
WHERE IS JAMBO
Rest in peace. You will be ehm. Yeah
A correction to your rancid take about temperature scales, because clearly some kind of brain worm has burrowed its way into your skull and forced you to support Fahrenheit.  As you know, Celsius is a scale arranged around water at 1 atmosphere of ambient pressure, where 0 degrees C is the freezing point of still water, and 100 degrees C is its boiling point. Conversely, Fahrenheit is _also_ arrayed around the behaviour of water, except it's got stuff in it. 0 degrees F is the freezing point of a water, ice, and salt slurry known as brine. You know, the shit you get on the edge of a sidewalk after the snow's started to melt? The brown, slick sludge that kind of looks like snow but has the consistency of a slurpee? Yeah. Add salt and that's the putrid mixture whose freezing point Fahrenheit marks.   I have heard some arguments that go something like "oh well if Celsius is how water feels, then Fahrenheit is about how a human feels." Listen. Buddy. I do not know of the human who would confidently say "I am at about a third of the heat I can withstand" while shivering and breathing a thick mist, as the light fades from his eyes because it's fucking 30 F outside and he's naked and dying of hypothermia. I do, however, know a number of people who would say "why yes, it's kind of cold" in 10 degree weather. 10 Celsius, that is.  Do you want to know something fun? Of course you do, you're reading this already. The ears of an average person can detect a five (5) degree Celsius difference in the temperature of poured water, given little to no practice. That's about a 10 F difference. Fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you-  Sorry, lost my composure there. If you take an alphabetised circle, which has "A" and "Z" back to back, you'll find that the letter "C" is closer to "W" than the letter "F" is. Therefore, degrees C are closer to being the W, and by rounding up the distance, they are in fact effectively a temperature scale W(in).
Celsius vs. Fahrenheit: The Case for Celsius as the Superior Temperature Scale  The debate over whether Celsius is better than Fahrenheit is a topic that has sparked discussions among scientists, meteorologists, and everyday people for decades. While both temperature scales serve their purposes, this essay argues that Celsius is a more practical, intuitive, and globally standardized system for measuring temperature. To make this case, we will explore the origins of both scales, their scientific merits, and their practical applications.  The Origins of Celsius and Fahrenheit  Before diving into the reasons why Celsius is superior to Fahrenheit, it's essential to understand the origins of these temperature scales.  Celsius, also known as the centigrade scale, was developed by Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius in the 18th century. Celsius designed his scale around the concept of zero degrees representing the freezing point of water and one hundred degrees representing the boiling point of water at standard atmospheric pressure. This simple, water-based reference point makes Celsius a logical choice for everyday temperature measurement.  On the other hand, the Fahrenheit scale, named after its inventor Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit, dates back to the early 18th century. Fahrenheit's scale was based on three reference points: the lowest temperature he could achieve in his laboratory (0°F), the average human body temperature (98.6°F), and the freezing point of saltwater (30°F). The Fahrenheit scale is less intuitive because it lacks a direct connection to the physical properties of water.  Scientific Merits of Celsius  Simplicity and Intuitiveness: Celsius is based on the freezing and boiling points of water, making it easy to understand and relate to everyday experiences. Zero degrees represents freezing, and 100 degrees represents boiling, which aligns with our common sense.  Universality: Celsius is the standard temperature scale in the scientific community and is used by the International System of Units (SI). This universality simplifies scientific research and global communication in fields like meteorology, physics, and chemistry.  Metric System Integration: Celsius is part of the metric system, which makes it inherently compatible with other metric units. This integration simplifies calculations and conversions in scientific work.  Logical Temperature Values: In Celsius, temperatures below freezing are negative, and temperatures above freezing are positive. This logical progression makes it easier to interpret temperature changes and trends.  Practical Applications of Celsius  Weather Forecasting: Meteorologists worldwide use Celsius to provide temperature forecasts. This consistency allows for easier interpretation of weather information, regardless of one's location.  Everyday Use: Celsius is more intuitive for everyday activities. For example, when determining what to wear in different weather conditions, Celsius offers a clearer understanding of temperature ranges.  Cooking and Food Safety: Celsius is commonly used in cooking and food safety guidelines, ensuring that food is prepared and stored at safe temperatures. This is particularly important for international food safety standards.  Scientific Research: In scientific research, where precision and consistency are paramount, Celsius simplifies calculations and data analysis.  Limitations of Fahrenheit  Lack of Scientific Basis: Fahrenheit lacks a straightforward connection to physical properties like the freezing and boiling points of water, making it less intuitive for scientific applications.  Limited Global Adoption: The Fahrenheit scale is primarily used in the United States, while the rest of the world relies on Celsius. This divergence complicates international communication and the sharing of scientific data.  Complex Conversions: Converting between Fahrenheit and Celsius involves cumbersome calculations, which can lead to errors in both everyday life and scientific research.  Inconsistency in Everyday Use: Using Fahrenheit in everyday life can be confusing when traveling internationally or communicating with people from different regions that use Celsius.  In conclusion, Celsius is the superior temperature scale when compared to Fahrenheit for several compelling reasons. Its simplicity, logical reference points, integration with the metric system, and widespread global adoption make Celsius a more practical and universally applicable system for measuring temperature. While Fahrenheit may have historical significance and a place in American culture, its limitations, including its lack of scientific basis and limited global acceptance, make it less suitable for scientific and everyday applications in an increasingly interconnected world. Celsius, with its intuitive and universally recognized properties, ensures consistency, precision, and ease of use across various fields, from meteorology to cooking to scientific research. Ultimately, Celsius provides a logical and reliable foundation for understanding and interpreting temperature, making it the superior choice for temperature measurement.
hi shlaqq
I don't dislike you. You will pull through.
No more tiktoks😢😢😢😢😢😢
How about we focus on the bigger picture; Celsius, Fahrenheit; they both suck because they are math; and math sucks.
Thanks for the laugh chlat

I miss him every single day.. It’s almost as if he’s with us to this day
It's like I can still hear his voice 😢
What the actual fuck is this video
He’s gonna be streaming geometry dash 2.2 actually, this is just a cover up
It's very interesting seeing the paradigm of Schlatt take ages to slowly improve, good luck big guy, I love wearing your hat.
schlatt your merch site is broken please fix it so i can give you more money 🙏
I love you
3:28
imo celsius makes more since to me cause too cold is negative and that’s more simple to understand
WHERE THE SHIT IS MY SHLANKET SHLATT??!??!?!?!?!
I miss schlatt
I SUBSCRIBED
I am late, I know, but WHAT???? HOW DOES THIS MAN THINKS THAT FAHRENHEIT MAKES MORE SENSE?? a random scientist just said "all right my wife clearly has a fever, let see what is her body temperature" and just put this temperature for like a 100 in his thermometer and for the 0 my guy fahrenheit just put the temperature of a mix between water, ice, salt and ammonia, HOW DOES THIS MAKES ANY SENSE??? celsius clearly makes more sense, is the boiling and freezing point of water, much more simple and understandable 2:33  '^'b
Missing shat been week
👍was scared you were gonna fully stop reaction
I don't know what kind of spray-paint or lotion they put on that cadaver, but Schlatt is looking good.  Glad to see you back
i love 'schlatt'
the queen also died a little over a year ago...
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN AT GAMESCOM????? g damn it
This is clearly a AI, we all know Schlatt passed away R.I.P Schlatt.🙏
I love how he immediately starts the stream with “this crappy old American unit is much better than the normal units everyone uses”
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOO  Gonna be honest schlatt, i feel like the reacting to pc setups thing wasnt bad, because there was alot more variety and fan input. But the tiktoks just felt stale.
Where are our schlankets?
i wont lie, reaction videos just drive me crazy, partially on the basis of them being such a thinly veiled cash cow, and i was bummed when that became schlatt's primary video subject. but i checked back in just in case, and i really respect the self awareness and re-commitment to doing fun stuff he enjoys. it can be hard not to be super content-brained in his position and just say 'fuck it im playing some games.' mad respect. too bad Shart was trampled to death by hundreds of wildebeests. fly high king
We all know he was hella gay while in prison.
9:55 When the city became worthy of the San Francisco name. x'D
I’ll miss the til tok series, but at least schlatt is less likely to go to prison now since he’s happier
Celsius is better
6:10 what the hell is the name of that song? It's been bugging me for so long
Hooray more content that I actually want to watch !
Came across this Video, didnt know it’ll end like this.. we’ll miss you Shaq 🕊️‼️🕊️
Wow this ai is great, will the survivors of the sleep deprived podcast receive 1/3 of the patron now?
jschlatt willy ou marry me
Its been so hard after the divorce
Can’t believe they finally milked by boy Schulch dry. RIP Schuttle.
Looks like he didnt keep his promise
You may change your content, but you’ll never change what you did to me and my family so long ago. We all have pasts, shclor.
So you're telling me we aren't getting the annual VGHS watch party?  Fuck
pp poopoo
alr see you in 15 years lmaooooo
I LOVE AMERICA!!!!!
These names dude 😂 we will all miss the Big guy. Fly high, Shlart.
I reckon October 4th will be an interesting day
Rest in peace Shlaunkity, you will be missed man. Even with the advance of AI, we all still know this video is a fake. Rest is peace :(
I actually really like the ranking videos so ty
Celsius is better and city Skylines is garbage
Damn, everything’s changed ever since Jschlatt died and switched to an AI making all of his content.. Fly high king, fly high. 😔🕊️🕊️
Schlatt they won’t let you leave because of what happened last time you went to Europe on September 8th 2022.
i can beat you up
Wow.. even the ai voices wants him back.. I’m in denial.. fligh high Schlutt, fligh high.🕊🕊
So sad seeing Schplinter in his last days... Rest easy Whipper Snapper. :(
Schlatt did you know Minx played prop hunt with jacksepticeye 9 years ago
Rip jschlatt

Whoever made this Schlatt AI, you did a poorly job, a disgusting version of our Schlatt man, RIP dude, we still miss you

rest in peace shlalchat 😢
schuckulus its been 3 weeks and nothing has changed
Naaa 0:03

missed my lil schlutty
Day 2 of asking what shlat did on april 9th
Hurt to see his face and hear his voice again after all this time. Amazing what AI these days can do. Thank you for this, Jambo, we all needed it. And fly high, big guy 🕊🕊💔 Gone, not forgotten
I agree Celsius sucks
I can’t believe he died……😢 rest In piece big man
But I like Chip rankings and jackbox
Glad he is bac from prison 😊
I'm so sorry for all of Shart's relatives, cats and friends 💔 Short was one of a kind, we will miss him 😓💔💔
the reason it got so many views is because youtube keeps recommending your live streams to me after I go to sleep and playing them automatically
Pepperoni
"Schlatt" is not allowed to leave the United States of America due to what took place in the United Kingdom on September 8, 2022 and of course the events of 1999.
Celsius and Farrenheit are both ass. Kelvin is the best scale.
happy birth day schlatt
Today we are here at the funeral of Jschlatt May we have a moment of silence for a fallen brother? He was a good man and he made us all laugh. I wonder who will take Jambo and his other cat. I don't know the name of it with other cat. You will be Miss Jschlatt
"Schlesus" died so we could live. RIP big guy❤🕊️
We’re going primal
Let’s go no more took toc
SICE WHEN WAS MR CRABS NAME EUGENE
Imperial is best for measuring and if you know Celsius it’s actually way easier! +temperature is hot -temperate is cold. Simple as that
Still can't believe schlot is no longer with us
On the Celsius point, I do want to just point out an argument I hear a lot. People often say it is easier to tell the temps, they make more sense. But that's also because you're used to it. If you grew up in Celsius, Fahrenheit makes no sense. Also, people who say there are less numbers in Celsius so it's worse are whack. It's true. There are less numbers. However, it's not likely that the average person can tell the difference between 75 and 80. 85 and 90. 65 and 60. Those 5 degree changes are usually caught in 1 degree of Celsius (technically less than that), but the point remains. There are fewer numbers, but more numbers in Fahrenheit don't mean as much.
16 farenheght is 0 celcius? right.  MAKES NO SENSE
Dang. Didn’t even get to say goodbye 😭. Rest in peace Schlartiplier 😞.
NO PLEASE, MORE REACTION VIDEOS REACTION VIDEOS REACTION VIDEOS REACTION VIDEOS REACTION VIDEOS REACTION VIDEOS REACTION VIDEOS
Just stumbled onto you on a different video and it said you were done streaming couldn't find any new videos of yours anywhere glad your still going excited to see what comes next
I can’t believe it’s been two weeks since he passed
rest in gayness, gayshcatt. We will miss you❤️
Hi jshit

Schleeber, you need to support Paradox daddy and play HOI4
Can’t believe I just found out  RIP Schleezer
rest in peace gang… almost like your still here with us… can’t believe how much ai has improved😔😔😔😔🕊️🕊️🕊️
if you play the rest of that celsius bit, he concedes like 4 secs later lmao
Mr jschlatt I learned about 911 today  you live in New York after doing that      You did some bad things but it's ok the British forgive you  It's a joke obviously
Rest in peace schlatty schlinkington, you will forever be missed by the entire schlommunity. Fly high legend 🕊🕊🕊❤❤❤❤
Just found out the tragic news today, miss you big guy. Rest in peace Shlump.

You look like wirtual if he had a beard.
RIP dingleschloop you will be missed❤❤❤❤🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔
Schlatt, you wont see this, but I wanted to tell you that I found you through your Cities Skylines videos. You got me into that game and I've loved every moment playing it, and watching the videos of you playing it. I really hope that you do a ton of Cities Skylines 2 videos because these videos are hands down the best on the platform.
I fuckin love you big guy
Pudgy
schlagg
Fahrenheit is good for everyday outside temperatures and celcius is good for scientific measurements  So schligglaratshat is right i guess
RIP jschlatt its so nice that jambo learnt how to upload a video for us all, RIP he died in jail
The best biome of all San Francisco
Ain’t no way he can make San Francisco worse 😂
you will be missed sir sclatty 🕊️♥️
I was tellin my friends "schlatt fell off" literally a few days before this video went live, and now I'm actually laughing my ass off at a schlatt vid again. Bonus points for the live user video reacts comin back, I missed those real bad. Nature is healing
So we are doing to schlatt what we did to Joe…understood,I love it.
You know what else needs to change? Those mutton chops. I understand you have gained a lot of weight since the before mutton chop era and you would look pretty fat if you shaved, but I think your better of accepting your weight gain and simply getting back to before. You simply looked better, and Im not the guy to say this but it would most likely be better for mental and physical health if you lost weight.
I'm so happy youre going back to a style that feels more genuine to you. I loved terh cities skylines videos and i always found them so much more entertaining than the reaction videos
Thank fucking God it's over
i think i forgot my schizophrenia meds because i swear i saw him and heard him
I KNEWW HE WAS ALIVE!!! (YOU IDIOTS THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD)
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Now he hasn't streamed in a month
Schlatt please I wanna join h3h3productions open the clan and let me in
The one time I'm thankful for AI. It's like "Schaltt" is still with us..
POOTIS
I lay on the floor at Dollar Tree and I'm a manager so when you walk on the floor in the store you are actually walking on me😊
Schlatt I have a proposal, let me into the Clash Royale Clan and I will personally upgrade it to tier 2
He is so brave showing himself on camera
Thank god, I hated the TikTok react videos lol
the shlump was hillarious
"The polution is starting boys, it is not bad" Yeah, just a bit of eye cancer and skin cancer ig, nothing serious.
Glad you got out of jail schlit we missed you
So sad to see a youtube legend passed away, RIP Schkrunkly 😢😢😢😢
RIP schlatt we will forever miss our big guy🕊🕊🕊♥♥♥

Rest in peace jshaitts you will be missed 😔🕊️
These days I smile a lot, I met a guy, his name is John, John taught me how to smile, I don't want to stop smiling, Why don't you smile with me?
The love I have for Schlatt is more than the love I have for women.
I’ll miss you big man slatt fly high 🕊️🕊️
Cool arg schlatt it was fun digging through it all I am excited for the new content
Rip big man
Yay your back
Rip schlatt 😔 you will be missed, fly high big guy 🕊🕊🕊

May Schlongerolonger rest in peace 🙏🙏 Only this AI can fill the void now, may he defeat Satan and become the king of hell 🙏🙏
Talks about making the algorithm happy alone with us and shows a scale of depression and stop milking videos for money. Five seconds later accepts a sponsor. Lol. Classic schlatt.

Truly missed you welcome back from Prison
Off topic, but did anyone else know that the definition of a second is incredibly long and specific. “The second is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency, ΔνCs, the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium 133 atom, to be 9192631770 when expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to s^-1”
Goodbye Slot Coin. You will be missed 🫡
RIP jshart
There are 1,109 comments straight of rip Jschlatt, fly high big guy, we miss you🕊️❤️🕊️❤️
Wow big guy... Didn't know that you had stage 6 testicular cancer and passed away... But to be honest your ai counterpart does your job better. Hope you see Волк in heaven. 🙏
were glad to see you back!! super happy to see you working on different projects. have fun!! missed you big guy!🙏🙏
ai is truly a really great invention, it’s almost like he’s still here with us. rip schlawg 🙏🙏
We all know that the “Schlatt” doing the reaction vids was just a doppelganger and you were on the run from Interpol since they picked up the trail from what you did in 99.
I know it's bait but calling Fahrenheit better than Celsius is one of the dumbest takes I have heard come out of this man's mouth, and he has a lot of braindead takes, he's like coney if he was popular!
I thought you died? People kept saying that you died in a car crash?
I do love reaction videos, but i absolutely understand how soulcrushing doing something like this for a year might be if you wanna do different shit. Exited for the future man
Lucky schlatt those English men weren't skilled enough to find the evidence of the big guy getting rid of their queen and prince, that 1999 experience really made him good at hiding evidence.
Jschlatt never fails to force me to smile.
Jschlatt is alive
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
My shligger shlatter shligga shlort how was prison and did you say hi to my dad
Can’t wait for the next tiktok reaction😁
man, RIP schligglegobbler, you will be missed fly high big man 🕊🕊🕊🍴
rest in peacis shat🙏💔💔💔🕊️🕊️🕊️😔😔
TAHNK YOU FINALLY
Why are there so many RIP comments y’all he’s not dead I’m starting to think y’all are doing this to mess with his head 😧
More Jackbox Plz
I'd rather schlat make video's he enjoys making that way the video's would be batter then if he doesn't enjoy making
Thats not floppy, its broken 😂
BRING BACK THE PURGE!!! PURGE AGAIN!!! I think it should be a tradition that whenever you make a comeback on livestreaming you purge a new community from you twitch.
Ommg gayshart video
I want to kill your  thought on that Fahrenheit or whatever it’s called is better than Celsius btw I am  better than water
its time to smile schlatt
I'm so sad that he's gone. Wish he was still here. Thank god for AI, it's keeping him here in memory. We will miss you Schlatt.<3
I’m so sad to hear our big guy has passed, rip king
Ily dad Thanks for coming home
Fucking post  Jesus christ
shlankit
Hey Jslizz  keep up the good work
I thought this was an apology video for what he did in 1999
I actually cant wait for this, im so excited for something that isnt a reaction video
naw f is better
Bro said he didn’t post as much bro barely posted in the first place 💀
Who resurrected shlat?
I can’t believe he’s finally gone. My heart and soul is in utter shock. Fly high, Fattsoo 👼
Rest in peace schitt this AI captures his essence so well😢🕊️
Happy to see the big guy letting go You go shlorky👍👍👍
Whatever it is you did in 99 it has to be related to hiding evidence, cause you FOLDED on that when we told you  that you ARE made from water
Blud became an ai, rest in peace shmongus
Happy for you Schlatt! So excited to see what you’re working on!!!
Ayyyy it launches on my bday 🎉
His impact on us was so loud, i can still feel it to this day 😔 R.I.P Schlong, gone, but never forgotten 🕊🕊
Rest in Peace 🙏

Fly high schlatt🕊️
Yess the ranking videos are amazing😁
omg i read the freaking title "things are about to change" and I was instantly filled with dread and flash backs to "things are gonna be a lot different around here by tomorrow" fucking hell, no job literal flashbacks
The TikTok’s were the only ones that made me laugh
Schoott what about your arg
Good to see Schlork finally recovering from the accident! So Proud! 🥳
Rest in peace schield potion. You will truly be missed in the YouTube Community.🕊️❤️
happy jschlittlyungus finally came back from his hibernation
🇺🇲🇺🇲WHAT THE FUCK I A CELSIUS!!!!!🇺🇸🇺🇸
you need to do a new series where you do an unedited walkthrough series for Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind each episode being around 40 minutes long and you go into more intricate detail on every tiny thing than the wiki; it'll last like 4 years long and by the end there will be like 405 episodes
i cant believe he can actually do that expresion in the thumbnail
Glad Shatt is out of prison
Man, you need to revisit your Radiohead series. Never completed that.
THANK GOD
Celsius is better because I like it and schlatt, known murderer and terrorist, doesn't like it
😔
Shlinge is no shlonger shlere. Shlest shlin shleace
jshat ❤
the reason why america created imperial is bc the ship that had the information for metric was taken over by fucking pirates lmao. it arrived late so americans had to create their own shit
Fly high king we will miss you 😭😭🕊️🕊️
It’s like I can still hear him, big sad
oh mannnnnnnn. Reactions was my favorite thing to watch when high as shit.
You're on reddit? Gay.
Guys this is actually carzy, i nearly believed he died. Like ugh why i cant reognise joke and reality.
Canada simulator
I seriously have to ask, bc bing won´t help me: Is he dead?
&Run by Sir Sly
Am mild fan chillin sorry but not. its fine you are a queen non binary queer cis loving. work on your gorwth.
Rest in piece schlint and steel you will be missed fly high🕊🕊
I could swear he made the same video before and talked about how he's going to do the weekly slap, before relapsing back into reactions.. It's like my friend telling me how he's no longer gonna do meth because it doesn't make him happy, and whenever I meet him he tells me he's been clean since then, but just happens to have some meth on him now.. What Slopp needs is react rehab...
Did they finally find evidence of the... England Incident.
R.I.P., Schatt 🙏
arg we all know schlatt is was the arg
no more goyslop lets go
This is what i’m here for welcome back big guy
Celsius tells you how hot water is, Fahrenheit tells you how hot humans are, Kelvin tells you how hot atoms are. Ranking just kinda be here
It wont be the same without Schhlattapus
0:03 You say you don’t enough evidence to put you behind bars but I know the sh*t you tired to pull in ‘99 but I WILL send you to prison one way or another. I’m currently testifying in court against you I don’t currently have enough evidence to put you behind bars, but I will send you to prison I SWEAR I will have you in prison in the next 3 years.
Good for you jscatt!
Celius is better. Weve got negatives.  Boom
Welcome, to Siesta Inc.
Fly high Schart. You will be missed

Excited to see your content change! 😁
Gonna miss the reactions but excited for the new chapter

Fly high, Schat. 🕊️🦆🐔🐤🐦🦃🦅🦜

Really miss you Schlatt, rest in peace 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 (pls answer on this comment or your a furry)
Where have we heard the title before🤔
I- i cant belive it.. hes gone,juat like that,im still crying  20 minutes after wacthing this. Rest in peace,Schlatt
at least big guy is self aware
Damn, theese AI Videos really make you feel like he is still Alive. RIP Schlagg 1912-2021
FINALLY! I literally unsubbed like a month ago cause that’s all the shit you posted! Glad to see a welcomed change of pace, wish luck, resubbed   -rep though, tried scamming out of my elite grade
Why is his head a circle now?   Also I can’t wait till it goes back to reactions and not streaming in 6 months
Schlatt we want the return of American trucking simulator
late but i think you'd love modded rimworld or the sims 2/3 if you love this game
Back from no-clipping into the "schlatt" rooms I see.
Dad?
yes
Please eat my toes
Woah woah woah what was that !?!?!?!
They wouldn’t let you leave because of the incident of 99
Well hurry up already
Rip schmatt, fly high queen
POV Schlatt in the thumbnail: 😏
Rest in piece schlinky, we’re gonna miss you 😢
so you say metric is better for measuring distance, how many countries that use metric have went to the moon?
schloodles is my favorite, gonna be tough with him gone. 😢🕊️
schloppy toppy will be missed. 🕊️
Jschlatt. It has come to the point where we are convinced you are AI. We need you to speak fluent spanish. I need to hear your voice...
i'm so high i thought he was gonna say "im pregnant"
What happened to schlatt?
"yes actual- ranking... this time I promise" Had my balls sweaty 🔥🔥🔥 glad ur back schlatt
You should move to Canada Schlatt, here we use a mish-mash of metric and imperial whenever we feel like it. We officially use metric, but most ovens and a lot of thermostats use Fahrenheit, and if you ask a Canadian his height I bet he'll give it in feet and inches. We also always use km/h for driving speed and litres for gas, yet sometimes people use miles per gallon for fuel efficiency since litres per 100 km is fucking stupid
Just got dumped, was considering ending it all but this video stopped me. Thanks Schlatt.
I WISH IT WAS ME!!!! NOT SCHLYTTE!!! rip fly high 🕊️ ❤️
Rest in peace schlitt you will be missed ❤🕊
“Shit” really is an inspiration for all of us. Fly high little buddy❤🕊️
well then i am sorry but i am waiting you to go low on money to download reaction vid XD
Rip schallt lost on the anniversary of his favorite day
just saying freezing piont is 0°c makes sence right? but freinhight or whatever it is is som random number
100 is really hot 0 is really cold, what could make more sense?
Rest is peace schlatt I’m going to miss all the memories you gave me. dips on the gun collection
The fan submission videos were absolutely hysterical, they had me and my brother in tears.  Has to be one of the funniest communities.
Its like we can still hear his voice. You will be missed "salt".
Jschlatt, I watched your interview with the create unknown and I’d love to pick your brain on capitalizing myself.
FAHRENHEIT SUCKS
Rip Shlagg, You had a shlong nose 😢
great, you'll be going back to other stuff, kinda like in that one video 3 years ago where you tried to become a dad in babysitting mama but the baby ended up committing suicide. such a classic.
RIP schlagg  U will be missed 😢❤
May you rest in peace Schat. Let’s thank Jambo for pressing the Upload button. I miss him so much..
I love you shallot
CELCIUS MAKES WAY MORE SENSE THAN FUCKING THE OTHER DUMB ONE. Below 0? Freezing. About 0? Not freezing. Suck it.
Rip Shit, fly high 🕊🕊🕊
Im so sad GaySlut is dead rest in peace😢😢 fly high. If thats is where you are going. Anyway thank you Jambo and Ludwig for these Ai vids. See ya big guy🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️
Why is comment saying scallt is dead
you will be missed, rip 🙏🪦💔
Schfatt
R.I.P jsclottshi i hope this message goes to his family members who created a ai version of him so that they don't have to show their faces because of what he did back in '99. You will be missed Mr.sclottshi 🕊️🕊️🕊️
Rest in peace my favorite little sugar plum pookie bear you will be missed
We will miss you Schlatt.
I prefer the gaming and ranking vids. Nothing wrong with the tiktok reactions, but I prefer to see more of schlatts opinion and input than what's usually in those videos. I watch YouTubers because I like them, not because I want to watch tiktok. I'm sure there's people out there who do that, but if I want to see tiktoks this channel isn't where I'm gonna go. I come here for Schlatt, so whatever gets me more of this funny guy I'm all for ❤
Meow     🕊️rip schlags fly high 🕊️
Kelvin is by far the superior temperature measuring system
Hey Schlatt u should read Zootopia abortion comic
I want more did Schlatt win
I’m sorry about the urethra
Fly high king, fly high 🕊
They should get schlatt, his buisness hard, secretly loving and yet phsycotic character into gta 6 as either a cameo or an online mission character thats some kinda goofy and definitely illegal adventure.
I used to wonder how u could drink titty milk all day everyday but from the free samples from moist I understand
rip schlott 😔😔
Rest well shlagg.. Happy your family and friends post some of your videos while your gone💚🦅
Rip sclat
Fly high little king🕊 .
I like to believe Jacksflim's war on SSSniperwolf's completely dead reactions to Tiktoks is causing other creators to look at this and self reflect. Schlatt's reaction were genuinely entertaining and actually provided comedy to what was shown but I'm glad he's moving on and doing new things. There's so much more potential with Schlatt as a creator vs just basic reaction videos. hyped to see whats next
rip shat.. we will miss you

Glad to see one of my favorite youtubers is back 🙏🙌
I cant belive that hes gone... ai should keep the channel going though, i hope
No it isn't
Thanks for everything "Schlatt" we will never forget you
Freshly out of jail but now he is gone😢😢😢 Fly high big guy!! We know you are an angel even after the ‘99 incident 😭😭🪿🪿🪿🕊️🕊️🕊️
I can’t believe “Schlatt” is gone RIP big guy
AI has gotten so good. You almost feel like he's still here...🕊️
10:00 do these people play dark souls or something
I love how unhinged your community is.
My favourite part about the whole series of jschlatt ranking tiktok memes, is jschlatt ranking them
Hey Jschlatt I was just permanently banned from your subreddit it for describing how to hide the body not that much detail either can I be unbanned?
Shlaggs big balls could not be ran on City skylines 1
NGL this tempted me to play city skylines. Might get it one I get my PC.  Hope someone reminds me through this comment
Literally recreating New York but without electricity

We watch you because of you jschlatt, not because of your stupid reaction (okay, maybe I lied)

I was just thinking yesterday morning on my way to work “I wonder if Schlatt is going to stream and upload the new Cities Skylines game” and then this dropped on my feed. Hell yes.

Glad to see the big man's back! We missed you, schlort.

Rip fly high shatty we will miss you i cant believe this happened ...
It’s a shame that shlunky passed away. Rest in piece big guy, 1962-2023 ❤❤❤😊

Put it on kelvin and put it on 1 just one.
1:00 ooooh can’t wait to see where you go next!!
Day 1 until Jschlatt notices me 2:14
Day 1 until Jschlatt notices me 2:14
Day 1 until Jschlatt notices me
Day 1 until Jschlatt notices me
Bro posted a TikTok reaction two days later on schlagg
Thank God
Stop lying to us you were in prison.
Did he actually die wtf
Jokes aside thanks Schlatt. Really been enjoying your stuff lately, between watching your vids along with when I'm gaming. Listening to chuckle sandwich while at work. Definitely thankful to have you around man. And it definitely makes up for the real reason you went to prison
Fahrenheit dumb
lets gooo no more tic tok reaction videos im happy for you big guy
Here we mourn the death of shat 🙏 RIP man ❤️
Classic Schlatt! 🤣
i’m sad to see you go. rest in peace.
shlog
Finally, more tier list videos! Can’t wait for the good old series to start again
r u on th zaza scatt cause sad=money and fun games=poor, me and you both know you like money SO DONT STOP
Can't believe Oschlama Bin Schladen is dead 😢
R.I.P smagg you will me missed 🫡
You are one of the funniest people on the internet to me and I really hated watching those tiktoks man. Felt like the same shit every time and was super fucking boring to me. I’m glad I can keep watching your stuff again!
Ambatukam
He’s dead ☹️
It's like I can still hear my boy Schnookums 😭😭😭
Rest In Peace to Skedadle 🙏🙏🙏 He will be missed 😔😔😔
R u made of water    Yes Yes I am
it's so sad that he died😢😢😢😢😢😢
he's a paradox interactive streamer 💀
Man. AI has gotten rlly good nowadays. They’ve even started leaving comments for Schlott. RIP 🙏
i see you in fitz videos !
The fuck is kelvin
Schlatt is a clickbait god he just spirals for a few months and then makes a video with an all lower case title and a serious face in the thumbnail which gets views and then repeats the cycle
Man even recreated the Californians leaving in droves for Texas...
2:20 What do you think is simpler and makes more sense?   0 degrees = frozen & 100 degrees = boiling (like in Celsius) OR 32 degrees = frozen & 212 degrees = boiling (like in Fahrenheit)  ???  I really hope you were just gaslighting with that super bad take, lol.  Nobody in their right mind actually believes Fahrenheit is the superior unit of measurement, not even Americans.
I miss scald more and more every day…thank you to whoever put this together with AI 🕊️
Poor ownerless cat :(
YEAHHH— those vids were the funniest ever
It’s almost like he’s still here. These ai’s are getting out of hand and need to honor him not make him a fake ai😢❤
celsius isn't the metric system, kelvin is
Why tf people saying rest in piece? He’s alive
Man i cant believe i made the perfect setup reveal video and this got uploaded the same day
Where is the day in the life of stream Schlatt!
L schluck💀
i was assuming the "plan" was the michael reeves strategy of stopping work on a video whenever it feels like a job
I stopped watching because of the tiktok reaction videos. To hear you say you’re gonna stop doing them put a smile on my face
Yay i love watching jschlatt :)
"are you water?" Yes, Schlatt, about 60% of me is water.
Rest in peace, Shitt
Rest in peace😢
Rip shlaggot🥺
Yes this is very good
gay schlatt
Goodbye schlatt, we will always miss you. ❤
Glad to see Shlogg is alive and doing well
its like hes still here... R.I.P jschlidile
play tf2
How tf is fahrenheit better
Farenheight is clearly the best, you have to use mercury and that means if your little thermometer breaks in your mouth cause you’re used to biting your boyfriends cock, you get mercury poisoning and die. Farenheight is clearly the best
No more reacts?! What a sell out.
cool
i can’t believe he’s gone…he’ll live on in my heart…rip scat 😢
FINALLYYY, i hated the tiktok reaction videos
im actually really happy YouTubers are starting to take their feelings into account, your mental and physical health should always be priority big guy💕
schlatt never fails to squeeze our cheeks and call us his little schlans
My favorite big guy back from the 99 trial
It’s sad that he left us.. Rest In Peace big guy.. 🕊
it's so sad that schlatt died from ligma
It’s almost like he’s still here, Fly high, Schlatt 🪦💀💀💔💔💔🪦💀💀🪦
Did Jschlatt just reference tokyolens? I have seen everythingm, my life is complete and now I can die satisfied.
nuh uh
I-- am genuinely awkward about all of this. Either this was the giant prank of 2022, with a death. Or he's actually dead. Wtf.
Okay
I'm gonna be honest I never knew he was retired from steaming.. mb
Fly high big guy 🪦💔🐸
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOO🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍎🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅
He looks like my dad
Thats one big gorilla tombstone
RIP
Schlatt is so sexy
rpi jshagg, you will be mist
Rip shclatt now he's a Schmat smlat splat
Thank god, I hated the react content im ngl it was so lazy to me felt like you had no ideas
it’s like he’s still here…rip schlatt, we’ll miss you 🕊️🪦
Fly tall shart 😢😢😢🕊️🕊️🕊️shart 200 bc - 2023….
i can start watching jshit again lets go
Maybe at some point we'll see Schlork play payday 3, reveal his experience and skill in the illegal sector of actions
I loved watching Jschlatt’s content and also hate reaction channels so I clocked out for a bit when the only videos he uploaded were tik tok reactions (not a fan of tik tok either lol) but out of nowhere I looked him up to see if anything new came up only to be greeted with a video of him saying he’s done w that type of content and it’s honestly such a relief. I thought we lost Schlagg to the darkside and he’d be yet another YouTuber lost to crappy youtube trends, especially when the content being made isn’t the skills that made the creator stand out in the first place. Glad to hear we got you back. My day is now brighter than the balls on your monkey statue
R.i.p shartt well miss you😢🕊❤
Ok
This AI schlatt seems so real! Rest in peace schlatt, fly high.
Fahrenheit is for brainless people, Celsius is better, but Kelvin is for the intellectuals
Rest in peace
R.i.p sholets ⚰️
Basing a measring system on physical constants of the universe means that you can calibrate measuring devices wherever you are. Celsius is objectively better than fahrenheit. 0-100 based on human body temperature is silly, because human body temperature varies considerably. Average human body temperature is also actually around 98.6 degrees, not 100.
R.I.P Schadolf Shitler you will forever be in our hearts! 😭 😢
Crazy to hear a New Yorker talk about shoebox housing in SF
Rest in peace shlagibbledat🕊️🕊️🕊️❤️ you will be missed more than the families you murdered back in 99 , you were the one keeping me going in the worst times, goodbye shlabittybat
So sad and so unforseen. Rest in peace shlibbitty bonk bonk. You will be missed🕊❤️
Thank you Jambo, we all miss Jshit may he rest in peace ❤️🕊️
I really want to see him stream hoi4 now.

celsius users may be stupid, but it's not stupid enough like what you did back in '99...   anyways schlong will be missed.
Oh damn Shlatts dead?? RIP in peace Big Guy
It's like he's still here 😢❤
RIP legend in the sky and in our hearts
RIP Schlogg, you will be remembered.
Oooohhh maan didn't expect to come back from school and see that. Schlutren died....😢😢
Rest in peace shlort ❤🕊️🙏
Did someone ever tell you, that you looks like kano from mortalkombat?
Am so happy he is doing ranking
Schlut city skylines stream soon 🤑
I know "Schlatt" and "his" reputation was tarnished from the unspeakable incidents "he" committed in '99, but still he ended up being a great and honorable man. Truly devastating to believe that he's gone for good. Thank you to Jambo, Charlie and Ted for using AI to keep his memory alive. Fly high big man.
Good, I was sick of them at this point
Fly high my little butterfly 🐓 thank you for everything Mr.Schatt
A tiny piece of my heart broke when he said “no more tiktok reactions”… rip but ay, at least he’s still doing ranking
nothing has changed, welcome back
nothing has changed, welcome back
Thanks Ted, your memories will forever live on with us. Fly high brother 🕊️🕊️⚰️
I love chat gaslighting him<3 rest in peace
This man really threw in the NotJustBikes quote.
Glad you escaped from prison

Finally, those reaction vids sucked. But love ya still fs🤍
So sad shlit died ❤🕊️
Hello Schlatt,  i have a reason why Celsius can be better than Fahrenheit even though i use Fahrenheit Simplicity and Intuitiveness: The Celsius scale is more intuitive than Fahrenheit for many people. Zero degrees Celsius is the freezing point of water, and 100 degrees Celsius is the boiling point of water at sea level. This simplicity makes it easier to understand and work with Celsius temperatures, especially for scientific calculations and everyday use. Consistency: Celsius is based on a consistent and easily reproducible reference point (the freezing and boiling points of water), which makes it more reliable for scientific and engineering purposes. Fahrenheit, on the other hand, is based on less intuitive reference points. Metric System Compatibility: Celsius is part of the metric system, which is used for most scientific and engineering applications worldwide. If you're working with other metric units, using Celsius can simplify calculations. Practicality: In everyday life, Celsius can be more practical for weather forecasting and understanding temperature-related information. Most weather reports outside the United States use Celsius, and Celsius temperatures are often easier to interpret, especially in extreme weather conditions. Gradations: Celsius has smaller degree increments (each degree is a smaller temperature difference) compared to Fahrenheit. This can be useful for precise scientific measurements.
lets gooo
rip bro

Hey salg could you watch and stream the entire movie of interstellar?
More untitled goose game
Hi Slap, I love you
we need more wii games
jshat you are my favoirte sreamer
Shlatt, Fahrenheit for you is like Celsius to us non-Americans, it’s like trying to comprehend the fact that not everybody thinks in their head in English, it’s really fucking hard to understand. If you were taught Celsius instead of Fahrenheit you’d think that Celsius is better than Fahrenheit

Taste and Flavor: Cheeseburgers are celebrated for their delicious taste and rich, savory flavor. The combination of a juicy beef patty, melted cheese, and various toppings and condiments creates a symphony of tastes that appeals to a wide range of palates. The umami from the meat, the creaminess of the cheese, and the tanginess of the condiments come together to create a truly satisfying culinary experience.  Versatility: One of the great things about cheeseburgers is their versatility. You can customize a cheeseburger to suit your personal preferences. Whether you like it with lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, bacon, mushrooms, or any other toppings, you have the freedom to build your perfect burger. This adaptability ensures that cheeseburgers can cater to a variety of dietary restrictions and taste preferences.  Satisfaction and Comfort: Cheeseburgers often evoke a sense of comfort and satisfaction. The combination of protein from the meat and the richness of the cheese can leave you feeling full and content. In many cultures, comfort foods like cheeseburgers are associated with positive memories and a feeling of nostalgia, making them a go-to choice for a satisfying meal.  Nutritional Value: While cheeseburgers are not necessarily health food, they do offer some nutritional benefits. Beef is a good source of protein, and cheese provides calcium and additional protein. When prepared with whole-grain buns and accompanied by fresh vegetables, cheeseburgers can be part of a balanced diet.  Accessibility: Cheeseburgers are readily available in a wide range of settings, from fast-food chains to gourmet restaurants. This accessibility makes them a convenient option for people with busy lifestyles or those looking for a quick, satisfying meal on the go.  Cultural Significance: Cheeseburgers have become a symbol of American cuisine and culture. They are a staple at backyard barbecues, picnics, and family gatherings. The global spread of fast-food chains has also made cheeseburgers a recognizable and beloved food item around the world.  Economic Impact: The cheeseburger industry, which includes restaurants, suppliers, and food producers, contributes significantly to the economy. It generates jobs and supports a wide range of businesses, from farmers and ranchers to food service workers and small business owners.  Innovation and Creativity: The cheeseburger industry constantly evolves, with chefs and food enthusiasts coming up with innovative and creative variations. From gourmet burgers with exotic toppings to plant-based cheeseburgers for vegetarians and vegans, this food item continually adapts to changing culinary trends.  In conclusion, cheeseburgers are more than just a fast-food item; they are a culinary delight cherished by many for their taste, versatility, and cultural significance. While it's important to enjoy them in moderation and consider nutritional aspects, there's no denying that cheeseburgers hold a special place in the world of food, offering comfort, satisfaction, and a canvas for culinary creativity.

schlatt x trevor is peak
So glad you came out of the closet, proud of you
rest in pieces shclut
it is better
Yea this video is alright
Damn, I just came across this video and... I can't believe the big guy is officially gone, I mean, even after '99, he was still a decent guy y'know... So tragic, Rest in peace Schlonk, you will be missed dearly... Fly high big man... 🕊🕊🕊🕊
Ai is getting really good
It's almost like he's still uploading. Rest in Peace Schlatt, you'll be missed. ❤️
YESSSSSSSS
this is the happiest day of my life
You will be missed 🕊️
And just like that, we’re back baby.
whats the girth of your balls??
thank you Jonathan Schlunt for coming on us once ogain
He's up there with the legend Breslyn, RIP big guy 🙏
It's so sad to see now that he's gone... fly high big man ❤🕊🕊
I'm just happy Schlatt got to sing Säkkijärven Polkka before quitting
rest in peace shlitt 😢
I'm glad to see the AI version of shtol is doing a good job making these content that us fans could watch and feel the nostalgia of... Fly high king 👑 It does feel very dystopian tho but I'm all for the world to burn down ❤
Oh thank GOD thank you very much
You will be missed, Shart. Fly high 🕊️
Welcome back, princess.
Can’t believe “Schlatt” is on the No-Fly List. This is almost as bad as what happened in 1999.
Schleet doesn't like Celsius but likes.... feet
Actually, do one more reaction video but make the thumbnail look like you're about to game end yourself
Its almost like he is still here
So happy to see schlatt back from prison
Mutton chops are going….
Just more shlies. Feels like he’s still here. Fly high 🤍
Wasn't ready for this, its like the big man is still alive and doing well rather than following into a spiral, Jambo your doing great at keeping his memory going, rest peacefully to the big man with his golden chops in the sky❤🕊
Where does sclatt stream?
Sorry big guy they took the evidence I was concealing from the incident in 99. If you weren’t in prison before you will be soon.
Rip bozo
Rest in peace Schloing, I'm glad that modern technology continues his legacy, it really feels lke he's still with us...
Fahrenheit was used to measure the freezing point of a mixture of water, ice and salt. that's less useful then just water
0:20 happy to say I never watched any of the reaction videos cuz I’m not lazy 🙏🙏
Have you ever considered playing some of the other Paradox games? It’s probably not gonna get insane views (or maybe it will, admittedly Idk if I want this many people exposed to the Hearts of Iron community lmao) but you playing with some of the bigger YouTubers in that space would be a welcomed fever dream.
it's so sad to know he's gone forever. REST IN PEACE HOTTEST MAN ALIVE
this is the best news ive heard since schlatt confirmed he had nothing to do with the death of the queen of england
I genuinely can’t express the depression at knowing I won’t get my TikTok slop react content anymore. I know I’ll love whatever bro does but… sheesh. I loooooooved that shit💀
Both Celsius and fahrenheit are nothing compared to Kelvin
Bro freezing is 0 and boiling 100 wdym
Make a bread tier list
No you're absolutely right about Fahrenheit being better for everyday use. Celsius goes from 0-40 degrees for livable temperatures, which is kind of fucking useless. Fahrenheit is much more granular and better for human reference points.   For scientific purposes? Celsius (using the kelvin scale) is better 100%. For telling the weather? Fahrenheit any day. Europeans can suck my nuts about it
Rest in piece, Slutt..
It’s truly unbelievable that Schladof Schlitler knew to film these videos before the accident. Fly high schitt ❤️❤️🕊️🕊️
Oh nice no more schlopp
To I first heard about you wen u went on the goons podcast and honestly don’t know why I just started watching all your vids and my guy love your shit your voice is fucking awsome.
Its so sad that he had to go like that. Rip schlatt🙏🙏
SCHLATT I SWEAR TO F☆CKING GOD STOP SCARING ME WITH YOUR TITLES AND THUMBNAILS
personally i think kelvin is better because absolute Zero is 0 in kelvin... that's it
He’s in a worse place now. Rest In peace Shloing 🙏🏻⚰️❤️
Damn, I just came across this video and... I can't believe the big guy is officially gone, I mean, even after '99, he was still a decent guy y'know... So tragic, Rest in peace Schlonk, you will be missed dearly... Fly high big man... 🕊🕊🕊🕊
Allahu akrabrr
Who the fuck in the chat said “halocaust”
This is a brilliant tribute in the name of Schlatt. May he rest in peace.
Schlatt are you ever gonna bring back wii sports?
Hope god let’s him back from hell for a season 2 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
I'm so exited for the future of this channel
Now this makes me smile
Sounds good
rest easy slate 🕊️

Rest in peace shart, his family is still creating AI of him to continue his legacy
I miss Jschlatt and Swagger on SMP minecraft. It was a wholesome time.
He is right f is beter
Youtube is about keeping woke people happy. And they are the end of humanity.
Fahrenheit is far superior
Can't believe that Schlimbo was taken from us too soon.. ❤
Do the wii game bonanza again. Do it now. I am entitled to this.
Is he just collecting play buttons at this point in the background lol
NOOOO😢
ill always miss slam dunk 🕊️ fly high

Hey big guy! Some of my hardest laughs recently came from the reaction vids, it brings me a weird comfort to rewatch them at my big age. Shocking. No job is worth your happiness though. They will be missed but i gotta respect it. Stay big 🤙
Should’ve removed their escaoe route

Even though we all know what he did in '99.....            Rest in peace big guy 🕊️
DO👏🏼WHAT👏🏼MAKE’S👏🏼YOU👏🏼HAPPY
F is best for humans. C is best for scientific use.
All of my respect went out the window once once you said Fahrenheit is better than Celsius. Now i am gonna reveal everything you have fone between 1962 and 2011, you will pay for your sins
Hope you had a good holiday weekend Schlatt!!
Shlatt just made real san francisco
shclit im gonna crew
WAIT NO WHY TF IS TAMPERE ONE OF THE OPTIONS!!???
Celsius is often considered more practical and universally applicable than Fahrenheit due to its alignment with the metric system and the International System of Units (SI). This global standardization ensures consistency in scientific research, weather reporting, and international communication. Celsius also offers easier conversions and a more intuitive range for everyday use. With 0°C representing the freezing point of water and 100°C denoting its boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure, Celsius provides a straightforward scale for common activities like cooking and understanding weather forecasts. Moreover, its avoidance of negative values in typical daily temperatures makes it more user-friendly for most regions.  Fahrenheit, on the other hand, is predominantly used in the United States, which can create challenges for international communication and scientific collaboration. While some individuals may be more familiar with Fahrenheit for local contexts, it has limitations in terms of standardization and ease of conversion, making it less practical in a globalized world. Additionally, Fahrenheit's wider range of temperatures can lead to negative values in temperate climates, which can be less intuitive for day-to-day applications compared to Celsius.  In summary, Celsius offers a more universally understood and applied system of temperature measurement. Its integration into the metric system, simplicity for conversions, and intuitive range for everyday activities make it a preferred choice for scientific research, global communication, and practical use worldwide. While Fahrenheit may have its merits for specific regional contexts, Celsius stands out as the more practical and versatile option on a global scale.
Finally! Shlutt's gonna start making his own content!
Thank god this man is stopping the tik Tok stuoid shit.
I'm sure November 3rd will be an interesting day.
Facts. I always say that C is for water while F is for actual humans…
It's like he's still here 😭
Ai makes it look like you never passed away, Fly high bud 🕊️
Im so glad, huh or even schlatt, that you are changing some things. :D Not just because i think tik tok reactions are lazy and kinda weird (sorry no offence) buutt you notice that you can do so much cooler things. Proud of you
Good thing he died just in time for Halloween, he is so committed to the ghost costume! R.I.P Schlaut.
Schlatt just decided not to be lazy anymore.
When is the Schlake going to be for sale I wana eat cake
Pls come to balingen weilsteten badenwurtenberg

I’m sorry for your loss Ludwig. Truly heartbreaking. Slott will be missed ❤🕊️
its crazy how religious americans are. how do you guys believe in the second coming of jesus christ, yet none of you  saw the second plane coming?
so glad to hear schlatt is moving on from his emo reaction phase. welcome back king
Happy birthday jschlatt 🎉❤
😭😭😭🙏 we’re free!!!!!
Welp, i have no longer use for this channel
lfg good stream
oh? Celsius is Wack eh? i guess you should prove it on Did Schlatt Win
The tiktok was really fun to watch
Shlatt I can't believe you would do this...         imagine the audacity to promote city skylines || three days before the anniversary of a horrible tragedy🏢🏢
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO
In all honesty, it was clear you hated the reaction videos, and I'm psyched that you decided to switch it up to something you actually cared about. Glad your finally out of the old slammer and able to upload again big guy.
We will miss you so, so, so, dearly, my buddy chum pal friend chummy bud partner Sheelatt. 🙏👑
ok this is a huge w
Ayyyyyy the big man’s back

I love Schlatt so much, rest in peace Big Guy
This is the most real video ever, especially when you watch older schlatt then the reaction videos you can tell it's off

Thinking of you a lot today :) 🛬🏙️❤️

i wrote an essay but i didnt click comment because you didnt tell me to.
it's so sad that schlittle mcfiddle died so suddenly. i'm very glad that someone uploaded this seconds before he died. fly high big guy  🕊️ 🕊️
🎉happy 9/11 Schlatt🎉
Schlatt it’s the day of the twin towers.
Happy anniversary schlatt
Brother,  Proof celcius is superior : You know that water boils at 100 degrees and freezes at 0 degrees For humans, because we are not water, -30 is cold as balls, -20 is very cold, -10 is still very cold, 0 is cold, 10 is aight, 20 is perfect, 30 is very hot, 40 is hot as balls.  Its just that easy. what do you want with your 78.8F LMAOOOOOO
If only the vid was posted on 9/11
I literally stopped watching you after you started doing reaction vids.  Thank you
Hey man happy anniversary For september eleven
Wait why did he go to jail?
I'm new here. Wtf is going on? Is man dead? Or is community big weird?
Hi from 9/11
FINALLY
Hey Schlatt...its that time of the year again
how can we bankrupt him so he makes more tick tock reactions jk
Schlatt…care to explain why you uploaded this video as a pre-game to 9/11? Huh? What’s goin on big guy?
Rip… he will be missed fly high 🕊️
Todays the 22 year anniversary since “Schlatt” did the thing
HAPPY 911
No nine eleven :(
Just sampled the titty milk gamer supp and thought it was really good so I decided to look up who it was partnered with and it brought me here. I recognize you. The drink is good but it will never forgive what you did in 1999
schlatt single handedly keeping me on this platform
YO Congrats on the Paradox Interactive sponsorship that's freaking dope!! Love their games, idek how many hours I have in CK3, stellaris, and AoW4
I think it’s really coincidental that he stopped doing the reactions right before 9/11, I’m just saying.
Schlott likes men
Yoo I hope JSchmitt isn't got da PTSD from being blacked in prison
Should’ve waited 3 days to upload cmon
Nice
And on this date happened 9/11😭
aRe yOu woAter?
Schlatt is back our bigman is back from prison we missed you🙏🙏
Happy Birthday Schlatt!
ahh i remember when his hair was like that. fly high schlott
but i AM made of water
United 175 New York 🎉
Glad to see schart one more time 🕊️
Don’t care
Common creators doing what makes them happy and creative W
bro thank fuck
Today is September 11, 21 years ago 2,996 died in that terrible disaster
We are water g’et gud
hi man, just wanted to say happy anniversary!
Hey jschlatt I heard u were a New Yorker so wanna play 2 rounds of jenga?
Still waiting for that gfuel collab…
Hey schlatt, it’s been 22 years since that fateful day. Happy birthday and know that even America’s brim remembers 😔
what a wonderful day today i wonder what happened a long time ago????
Didn’t ask for an Essay bud… I want to see your viewers filth
i think fahrenheit is more intuitive for daily life but im used to numbers in celcius and they are intuitive to me because i have heard and used them all my life. in the end, stuff like that is mostly subjective.
-1C= freez water 0= stable +1= evaporate  what not to understand??????? this is the only thing that Jschlat make me fucking hate him
Finally, some variety
Even though the tik tok reactions kinda over saturated the channel for a while I still think Schlatt was one of the best when it came to reaction content. Unlike a certain other tik tok reactor who shall remain nameless, Schlatt would always keep us entertained with his jokes, laughter and additional commentary. Can’t wait to see a much wider variety of content in the future
NICE rant and rank is okie if you gotta stop the reacts hahahaha
Schlagg probably doesn't even know what farenheit is based on. Because spoilers, while it was aimed to have the human body at 100, its actually measured by the temperature of an equal ice-salt mix and the boiling point of that mix.
good to hear! I loved the streamed fan reacts and the older series. sounds like moving in the right direction
Would ya look at the date….
9/11
While I do agree that Fahrenheit is better than Celsius, I can't fahrenheit at all because I grew up with celsius.
Happy out of prison day jshlatt
Rest in peace Schit. Fly high brother
It's been 2 days you lied to us
thank you for keeping shatts memory alive, AI has come a long way. RIP
His videos always go trending on 9/11
Shlug
Fresh out of prison and the worst ending happens . Life wasn’t fair to you my boy😔
Kelvin 2:23
genuienly so happy about this, can’t wait for the new content :)
Its 9/11 :)
Thank god
Do not forget what Schlatt did 22 years ago! 🏢🏢✈️
Sorry for typing out my dumb little essay But... Fahrenheit doesn't account for humidity so it's not even a good way to tell how hot it's going to "feel" 95F at 10% humidity is going to feel very different to 95F at 90% humidity Not to start a Fahrenheit vs Celsius thing That's just my one biggest gripe with Fahrenheit
You did 9/11 dont lie to us....
Rip schlatt you will be missed😔
finally my comfort yt returns! (probably hates me bc i’m from nj)
it’s been so long and AI has come so far, feels so nostalgic to see a video of him, RIP Schart 🙏🕊️
Can’t believe Shlatt made it out of the slam. His cell mate Big Earl told me some stories 😜
How do you feel about 9?11 today?
FINALLY MKRE CITIES SKYLINES
We live😊 we love❤ we lie😢 dududududududu
Happy anniversary of your silly accident!
fly high "Jslatticious" you'll be miss Truly Heartbreakinh🎉😢😢🎉
I know what you did, schlatt. New york won’t forget easily.
The fal is made for 280 brittish not 308 winchester but since the minum requirements where 30. Cal they had to use 308
Happy anniversary Slatt!✈️💥
NOoOoOoOoOoO don't stop with the tiktoks
Hey schlatt remember what happened 22 years ago today ?
Shlat
Schwarts the earth and I are 68% water we are divine water machinations if it’s 100° I know I’m boiling if it’s 50 I’m not going outside +or-  you are stupid stupid man the farheight system is good for measuring internal systems because maths actually works well in conversions of temperatures and electricals measurements it’s good on the inside but all externals of eyeballs are better with Celsius
I'm Australian, he right amount celsius.
yo guys guess what day i posted this comment... jschlatt will hate me for this lmao. (clue: its the eleventh)
remember what happend 22 years ago form today
Welcome back from prison big guy!!!
I like how your thinking schlatt now take that one step further to where the government owns all the housing then there wouldn’t be rent at all!!
Bro there is a Arab guy that his videos are just like you
Are we gonna get anything for today? It's such a special day 💕
Towers go boom😂
Rest in peace big guy ❤
Americans think that using 100° for the boiling point of water is stupid because the don't know how to cook.
yeeeEEEAAAAAAAAAAA
Thank god he got bailed
I can’t believe you found the secret crabby paddy formula
It's almost like he's still with us. Fly high, Shit 🕊️🕊️🕊️
You should play some horror games i think that will be funny.
YESSS finally some more gaming videos. Humor that comes from him not random videos
those reaction videos will  go down in history🧕
Celsius is better.
Welcome back from the dead "Shlit"
So Hoi4 next?
WHAT THE FUCK IS CELSIUS 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🦅🦅🦅🔥🔥🔥🔥
When I grow up I wanna be schlatt
Fly high brother ''Shlot'', we'll miss you but you will forever live in our hearts. 🕊🕊🕊
RIP schlatt your AI replacement will keep your legacy alive!
YESSS SCHLATT SO HYPED FOR THIS NON REACT SCHLATT IS SUPIOR
"Schlong" is unironically one of my favorite YouTubers at this point. Don't ask me why.
I’m so happy Schart played this game!
Thank god man. Miss the days when you still liked the stuff you created.
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.  He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.  He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.  He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.  He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.  He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.  He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.  He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.  He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.  He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.  He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.  He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.  He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.  He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:  For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:  For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:  For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:  For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:  For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:  For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences  For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:  For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:  For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.  He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.  He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.  He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.  He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.  He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.  In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.  Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.  We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.
Happy birthday John Schnatt.
Happy birthday schlatt🎉🎉
Big guy plays brawlhalla at 10pm
Celsius is how water feels. Farenheit is how we feel.

Man i really miss shart watching this Ai thats really good makes me tear upp 😢😢 May jambo be alright with his new family Fly high shat🛩🏢🏢🕊🕊
Happy birthday big boy

happy birthday big guy 🎉🎉
Thank you schlutt
Honestly id be real happy for Jackbox to come back
It’s almost like he’s still with us ❤ o7 big boy
It has been one year since you killed the queen schlatt. It will haunt you forever.
Yes he is finally making normal videos again😂
Knowing the temperature of boiling is less important than knowing the point of freezing imo. That part of the degrees system is useful.
My audio was broken at the beginning and i thought it was a whole bit
Mad respect. 🤘
I think it's a good idea to move on from til tok as a whole. Let alone reactions. It's time for us to move on to something better. Something more fulfilling and meaningful.
Will Schmitt ever do truck simulator again🤔🤔🤔
Ohhhhh,schlattttttt,guess what day it is tomorrow?
i liked the dayz vods a lot very cozy like cozy street
The fact that, for a short time, there was a chance that Schlisoner and RTgame could've been on the same crane-lifted gaming banquet table near where I live terrifies me.
‘We’re gonna play some games’ and ‘we’re gonna rank shit’ dude stfu and do Exit Music for a Film I’ve been waiting for like half a decade
i’m so glad you’re doing content you’re enjoying more now big guy!! we love what you love, and not just because you can and will kill us swiftly and silently if we don’t watch and enjoy your videos
thank god
Happy birthday Schlatt!
stal
We watch for you and not for your content. Whatever you want to do, we'll be here to watch 👑
SCREAMING RN HOLY SHIT
Rahhhh SF
Glad to see karma finally get him, RIP
Rest in peace pookie schlatt ❤❤ miss u 😢
He never “ranked” the tiktoks though
Did u beat up the biggest guy in jail? Either way I’m happy ur back 🎉🎉
Fly high little guy🙏🙏 going to miss your (nonexistent) streaming and videos🕊️🕊️🕊️
By the way, in case anyone was wondering the reason why we couldn’t leave the country is because there is a warrant out for his arrest. He’s currently number one on the FBI’s wanted list
They also started getting less views
Where's jambo
It wouldn't be a schlatty video if its not sponsored 🤭
“Things are about to change” *makes San Francisco*
Resepect
Hey schlatt 👋 congratulations on getting back to this kind of content. Your vids pulled me through from some hard times and put a smile on my face even when it was still wet. For this at least i know I'll be watching you no matter how much poopy reaction content you put out.  Love you big guy ❤
Yeah but like they’re funny
Nice schlatt.  Reactions are dope when it's with stream submissions, it's such a hilarious time.
Hey schlatt I heard tomorrow is a big day for you?
The reason they didn’t let you into Germany is because they know what you did “Schlatt”
HAPPY BIRTHDAY SCHLATT! you will be messed 😢
i still dont get how people are normal about this. This guy is the only one who makes me laugh seriously him dying is just pretty sad for me. Fly high Schlatt
I watched so much videos with an AI talking with this guy's voice that I keep thinking he's not real
Bonk
Happy birthday schlatt
happy bday big guy
And 212 f°is boiling point for water makes lots of sence
I was waiting for this vid
Nice to see schlutt is back
jschlatt really just played like every major American city’s mayor
Didn’t ask
Yes!! I’ve missed your gaming / tier / rant videos so much
happy birthday big man
Please come back dad I miss you
W
"things are about to change" *stares at the date* schlatt nO-
I bet more big things are coming tomorrow
NICE BUT I WILL MISS THE REACTION
Sometimes it feels like he’s still alive. Talking to us. RIP Schlart
happy birthday mate
Well that’s an ominous title…
you should play teardown
rip schlerg, fly high big guy, you will be missed
Captain soy sauce
Thank you Schlatt
transitioning a update video to city skylines 2 is amazing. 10 outa 10 schlatt from one creative to another
Schlatt, when making a video near 9/11 you should really think twice about your title
Dude you will forever be missed big man. Fly high brother 😔🙏🕊️
schlatt buddy dont worry about not uploading.... when was the last time dream uploaded?
Happy birthday big man
Jshlatt, do more American Truck Simulator
Glad to see we can watch Schlatt with the good old content like this again even if he's gone RIP QUEEN 10.09.2022 RIP BIG GUY 10.09.2023
Thank god, Scrappy Doo is going back to making semi-original content
Im so happy you’re out of prison, i don’t understand why killing minorities is even a crime
but i like the tiktok reactions
I can forgive changing the temperature settings. But you put that shit back to military time or I'll do you dirtier than you did that family on the highway in 1999.
I love you ♡
🦄 yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Did you really think that you would get away from me after what you did on April 9, 1999.
We all know schlatt called saul to get out of prison
Glad he finally got out of prison mist him
THANK GOD. Those tiktok reactions are hard to watch (respectfully)
Imagine if schlatt was consistent for more than 3 months at a time . That'd be crazy
Ya
celsius is way better
Thank you Schlatt for finally letting your genetically mutated clone take control of the channel ❤
i love ur ranking vids
Bro built a city shaped like a cock, I'm dead💀💀💀
HAPPY BIRTHDAY BIG GUY❤
"My goal is to make this city non-walkable as possible" Graystillplays:
We need more videos with serious sounding titles but it’s just some silly little gameplay
Thank you to AI 🙏🙏 its almost as if schlonkle is still here with us 💗 rest easy schlork 🩵🩵🩵🪽🕊️
Fly high big guy. ❤❤🕊🕊
Best city I've evere seen 😂❤
i will miss the react videos, when i played video games id put it on as noise and because the mutton chop man actually reacts.
rip
finally
I LOVE YOU JATT
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
super glad schlatts back from prison 🙏🏻 missed you big guy
Schlatt i watch you for you, not the content. I love your humor and I'll happily give you some money through that singular view for whatever thats worth
yay
This AI really makes it feel like he’s back here with us. Thank you Ludwig for this and fly high big guy. 🕊️🕊️
Fly high big guy🕊️🍑
Happy Birthday🥳🖤🖤!
I can't wait the the schlitter to react and possibly rank my favorite Snapchat stories
Yippee yippee yippee
L take, unsubbed. Horrible take.
HAPPY BIRTHDAAAAAAAA
Let's gooo those kids deserved it
So we can finally stop hitting the TV waiting for a video?
I can’t believe he’s back after all he did to women in 99
celsius is just better because when it is freezing outside the temprature is negative
Schlatt for president
submissions are good way better than just tik toks. Lets go big alcoholic shat, lets gooooo!!!
good job schlop
Kind of hilariously ironic that a Texan is shitting on the power situation in California. Texas has way more issues with their power grid than California. It gets too cold, Texas has no power. It gets too hot, Texas has no power. Shoulda called this city Dallas or Austin.
Thank you to whoever created this video of Jschlatt AI as a final farewell for his viewers, its almost like he’s still with us. His content has always brought a smile to my face and it breaks my heart that he is no longer here. Fly high, Big Guy 🕊🕊🕊
I didn't know shippity shlap had a twin. Damn.. I am going to miss him so much but at least we still get to see similar content. Fly high kind :((
I love Shatt
Rip "shlat". Your actions will be remembered, especially for what happened in 1999. Fly high Big Man.🕊❤🪦
Damn Schlatt could’ve been up there with martincitopants
Fahrenheit is better than Celsius for measuring human temperatures. The boiling point of water almost never fucking matters to me. If the temperature is at boiling point I have bigger issues   100 is hot you shouldn’t be outside at 100 for an extended period of time but still safe. 0 is cold you shouldn’t be outside for a extended period of time.   With Celsius 100 is skin boiling hot and 0 is “eh fairly cold” throw on some thick socks and a hoodie or two and don’t wear shorts
Rip Shclonkt, fly high. 🕊️ 🙏
He came back from the dead???
I actually clapped when he said that there will be no more tik tok reaction videos.
Welcome back shart
Both systems of measurement are good. One works for intelligent well funded Europeans, the other works for lesser funded American scholars.  In reality, who tf cared what you measure in, imma measure in coke cans at this point idgaf
We're so fucking back
You needed a whole ass video to tell me that you’re not doing TikTok videos no more and shill out in the remaining 10 minutes to cities skylines 2
ok the topic of celsius, to quote my favorite greentext, "farenheit makes more sense for people. and im a people, not a water.
Happy birthday :)  its gonna be my birthday in 2 days
Happy birthday big guy
Had to end before the possibility of a 9/11 meme stream. Good call bruther
So nice of ''Schlatt'' to Things are about to change.
Big excite
still reminds me on what happened back in '99
My entire life has been changed by our Lord and Saviour Jschlatt, I’m so glad his old footage is being brought back, see you in heaven big guy 🕊️🕊️🕊️
On January 17th 1999 it was 12 ° in downtown Chicago
These AI voices are so realistic now.... Its almost like hes still herexfly high big guy 🕊🕊🕊
HAPPY BIRTHDAY JSHLATT
I love this style of videos! Really brings me back to how you used to make videos back in the day. Good job Schlatt, and thank you for this!! Stay awesome.
Thank you 🙌
Medwick beddewr
WAKE UP THE KING HAS POSTED!!!
I LOVE YOU SCHLATT DO WHAT MAKES YA HAPPY!!!
finally, I guess "schlatt" has started to think about his mental health now hope to see shat get better soon each time
Our temperature measuring system doesn't start with F
Welcome back mtfker
Schlott lets play Baldurs Gate
Happy Birthday Schlatt!
IM SO HAPPY its such a nice change Schlatt
im so excited to see whats in store for schlatt, i love his content and i am glad hes deciding to move in a direction that makes him happier
We need a soda ranking jslut. Glad ur back from prison, I know the tower incident was an accident and u didn’t have anythi- you didn’t have much to do with it.
When will u get married?
So glad that he was able to confess his crimes
Hes gonna come
Happy birthday schlatt!
2:31 what a coward - cut it off right before he defeated his own argument 😤😂
Thug that shit out
nu blyat
finally  i was really sad about one of my favorite creators spiraling down into lazy ass reaction content made purely by the viewers  glad to see the original schlatt i loved several years ago come back  hope the new content will be just as good as the times spent with волк and утка
Rip  big guy🙏🕊🕊♥♥♥♥
Where does big guy stream?
Rest in peace 🕊🕊
I saw the title and said don't look at me like that bud
I FREAKING LOVE THOSE VIDEOS, HAPPY BIRTHDAY BTW 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Ok BUT. Roblox car accidents.
HOW TF DOES FAHRENHEIT MAKE MORE SENSE. At 0 celcius water freezes at 1 and above celcius water is liquid and at 100 celcius water boils. Its so much easier to understand, and 20 and above is like a warm summer day
I will tell the doctors to test your temperature in celsius
.
Negative celsius means it is cold outside and you have higher changes of breaking your back from ice
thank god that era of jhshlatt is over
beard?
❤❤Fly high Jonathan schlatt Fly high ❤❤     you will be miss.
Sounds good big guy👍👍
Fahrenheit makes so much more sense 🥺🥺 "Schlatt" thinks water freezing at 0 and boiling at 100 is hard to understand. He also doesn't know that YES we are made of water   (For legal reasons this is a joke please do not harass me in any replies) (or do) (I don't really care)
Lets gooo! Cities Skyline is how I found you before the facecam days! I'd love to see more videos of it!
wow ai is so advance sclit actually sounds alive missing the legend I will never forget what he did for me in 1999 he is a real brother for killing those 5 infants for me
YALL HE AINT DEAD
but i loved your """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Reaction"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" videos
Ajubuhcu ayubuchichcu ayu buchu buchu❤❤😊😂😅😂😂
does anyone actually spend their time wondering if an internet "personality" uploads less often than they used to? I feel bad for your real life friends if you do, please go spend time with them.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY BIG MAN
LETS GOOO WELCOME BACK Let’s gooOoo
YAYYY CITY SKYLINESSS
NOOOOOO NO MORE TIKTOK REACTS 😭😭😭😭
Actually, as a metric system supporter, I also prefer Farenheight. The reason is that it was designed based on what the temperature _feels_ like to a person. It's intuitive, and it's easy to use.
Couldn’t believe it when I heard that Jesus Schalt had passed away in prison. Rest easy Big guy 🕊️
Even Cities is unaware of what Schlatt did in San Francisco
SCHLAT LET ME THE FUCK OUT OF YOUR BASEMENT IT SBEEN 8 YEARS
why do you have so many channels
Happy birthday Schlorp!!!
this almost made me cry, it’s like he’s really still with us. the AI is amazing. fly high Shlate 🕊️❤
I’m so schlenis is not dead
"of no streaming"  Oh god apparently now I can't hear Schatt say "no" something and not think of games, infinite games, but no games.
Sup, Schlatt? Long time no see!
love you schlatt do what you need to do kid <3
I’m glad he still is gonna react to the sub Reddit, that’s all I cared about
hey Editor, just trying using Fahrenheit for the weather for a week. In the context of weather, Fahrenheit feels just as orderly as the metric system to me. 0°F is "Very Cold" 100°F is "Very Hot" 90°F is hot outside 80°F is warm outside 70°F is neutral outside 68°F is "Room Temperature" 50°F a bit chilly 40°F I have a coat on 30°F it's snowing
Honestly very glad the react videos are gonna be slowing down, I’ve been watching for years and realized I’ve simply just gotten older and it was the most unfunny videos you’ve done, or it’s just not my type of video. Love your original content though big guy
No!! How will i know how to react to things if you dont show me 😢
Holy shit #8 on trending
What music is in the backround?
Rip shilt 🙏
It's so cool his parents uploaded his prerecorded video! Rest in peace king!
I still pray for a return of the Wii games and hope that they rake in the views for him.
Schlatt, as a fan I must tell you this. The ad that I got before your video was a child hunger ad but they used the South Park randy marsh scene. I wish I was making that up.
LETS GO GUYS! GAMING TIME
This is like what schlatt did in '99
thank fuck glad youre back
I feel bad for shlatt not being able to leave the country since what he pulled in 1999, and that stunt he pulled in Germany.
HAPPY 24TH BIRTHDAY SCHLATT🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉🎉❤🎉  AND WHY IS EVERYONE SAYING RIP YOU ARENT DEAD ARE YOU? HELP IM CONFUSED-
goodnight ted nivison i hope your dreams are full of homosexuality
Schlatts channel after this announcement: subscriber rate drops to 0%
Yay he’s alive now
Holly shit  0:53
I’m literally watching all the vods of these to fall asleep to 💀
Schlatt is back baby!
its almost like he's still here, rest in peace. 🕊🕊
Bro gaves us some news then played some city skyline highlights so he could get that 10 min mark pure business man respect the hustle
Not gonna lie I didn’t hear a dam thing I’m just lost in those gorgeous eyes ❤
Saw the title of this vid and immediately had PTSD to the Dream SMP
Water boils at 100c "are you water?" Yeah like 75% 😅
Jshlatt is a TRUE patriot! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 USA!!!
Bruh exactly like if its hot out its like 80 - 100 not fucjing 20 or 30 degrees
Glad to see his trial worked out
RIP Schlatt will never be the same without you <3
i can't believe "Things are about to change."
nice for shlant to make a pre-recorded video for us. fly high big man🕊🕊🕊🕊🕊
He should just not upload again for like 6 months and then post another video being like “it’s time.” And then wait a long time and do another one
It’s like he is still with us. Fly high 🕊🕊
Why did they give you early access but not @realcivilengineer
finally, small man decided to make content again
HAPPY BIRTHDAY :)
Bro this found jschlitt video is fire, makes you feel like he's still here
Excited to hear, “Schmick” I like your alternate content. It’s entertaining and helps me stay sane.
Ladies and gentleman, lets see if schlatt is a victim of audience capture!
5:40 my street’s shaft is bigger than that lmao (my street is seriously shaped like a dick and balls though)
Nooooooo! Not my source of monthly laughs
Schlatt did it.
finally
I’m glad. I’ve been a long time fan but I stopped watching due to the change in content.
I’m so glad that Schlatts clone (Schlardle) was able to take over the channel. RIP Schlatt
good stuff
Happy birthday schlatt you big man 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
can't wait for some more cities skylines! maybe we'll get a visit from mebeeb and oneb. anyways, good to see ya big guy.
my road curves to the right... is that normal
What happened to the smilers
I'm a doller and 30 seconds in this video while looking at the comments and it's just people saying he's fucking dead what the hell
Its almost like shats still here. Fly High  Big Guy
I'm so glad that slate has returned from the asylum
i use celcius for the lower temps and fahrenheit for the higher ones. 0 degrees is cold outside and 100 is hot outside. somewhere around mid fifties fahrenheit and 10 degrees celcius i switch over
Gone but not forgotten. JSchlurp was such an inspiration to us all.  Fly high big guy 🕊🙏
Jschlatt really is a big guy now
Can’t wait for the tier lists tbh
Shift
Schlat could have earned a doctorate in theater arts for how long he's been acting his reactions
Oooooooohhh yessssssss give me some Jschlatt ranting videos
the city skylines videos were the best. brings me back to middle school when im almost graduating.
На русском: Здравствуйте дорогой мистер Schlatt. Я хочу поздравить вас из России с днём рождения. ( ｡⁠◕⁠‿⁠‿⁠◕⁠｡)   In English: Hello dear Mr. Schlatt. I want to congratulate you from Russia on your birthday. (｡⁠◕⁠‿⁠‿⁠◕⁠｡)   (I apologize if I just disturbed you 👉👈)
Rest in peace, this ai is pretty convincing.
fly high big guy
It is crazy how far AI has gotten. If only Schlatt had been able to see it... Fly high big man 💕🕊️🕊️🕊️
Fly high chops🕊️🕊️🕊️
Shaltt we dont watch you just for one milkable content, we watch for literally whatever the hell you post man
imperial is better for speed of cars, weather, and distance for things bigger than a football field, metric is better for Everything else, Cooking, weight, volume, length, time, etc.
2:32 i have no idea how farenheit works so
How does this impact theweeklyslap’s legacy?
YOOOO CANT WAIT BIG GUY
Bro thought he was lets game it out
I loved that wii games video so much and I was GENUINELY disappointed that it didn't get as many views as the Ranking series videos. There was so much effort in it and it was fucking hilarious! But I knew that it'd have to just be a point of pride to quit that series. I'm glad you're movin' on to stuff you like. Shitloads of effort in there
fuck celsius
Aaaaaaw kitties
At 2:45 get rid the chops and mustache average Minecraft YouTuber intro face
You are the GOAT
4:11 the not just bikes skeet was just perfect 😂
Yo but the fact he actually smiles less and less in every thumbnail bro 💀
jackbox content?  rip
1:59 controversial? I think you mean correct
I was wondering why there weren't any adds, then i watched the video. Makes sense now.
LETS GO
Fahrenheit is a lot more precise than celcius. There's 100 degrees between frozen and boiling for celcius, whereas farenheit has 190 degrees between frozen and boiling water.
theres a reason why only americans (the stupidest group of people) use fahrenheit
I’m so happy that schlatt is still posting from prison 😭❤ Miss you big guy
[nice words to adhere to comment gudelines] shlatt. I just looked up how Farenheit was designed. Brine? Freezing mudwater and a estimation of body temprature. We most definetly are both wrong here. I grew up with celcius. But Kelvin is truly the only one that makes sense.
Hell yes
Holy shit I was loosing hope but I think you already lost a lot of your core audience. There’s a lot of tik tok kids that will leave when you start doing normal content.
Finally 'schlot" came back just in time...
yo schlatt i bought your gamer supps titty milk and its better than my moms titty milk and i still drink it.
NOT JUST BIKES MENTION !!!!!
will you still upload the vods of the reaction streams?
Does this mean we will get the list where you fix your opinion on chewy cookies
YES CITY SKYLINES 2 LETS GOOOOO
skank is back ?!?!?
Why is his head so cubed here?
This is schlatts apology video after getting cancelled on myspace
These AI videos are getting really realistic, it almost feels like he's still around. Fly high, Shart.  🕊🕊🕊🕊🕊
I'm so glad you're focusing on our submissions again!! In one of the first TikTok reaction videos you posted, I realized you weren't reacting to your audience, you were just doing, as you said, basic, cookie-cutter reaction videos. The magic was gone. Good to see it'll come back.
"Schlatt"s back!
What soup doing
Schlatt immediately getting attacked for his opinion in Fahrenheit is hilarious, we true fans know Fahrenheit was the best way to calculate the "weapons of mass destruction" in 99
So I can actually watch schlatt videos again? No more tiktok?
I LOVE YOU SCHLATT YOUR AMAZING
fly high shlagg its so realistic the AI
j shit i love you content😍😍🥰🥰
Do what you need to, Big Guy, happy dude means funny content.  Keep it up. 👍
these comments.. I can't 😭😭
Well I mean the last time you went to Europe.....RIP Queen
Weezer ?
Fly high big guy 🕊️🕊️
Do what you love best Shact ❤
I definitely miss when you made content you cared about. I can't stand the vapid shit but I've been around for like 5 years now. I wish this would signal an actual return to form, but I am skeptical. Best of luck regardless.
THANK GOD HE ACTUALLY LISTENS
I Miss Schlussy sm. Forever missed baby boo 🪦💔🕊️
Im hype for rantschlatt
Shlatt had a kid that's why he stoped uploading as much
Big man’s been released, props to you for getting that bail
Fly high, big guy 😢🕊
Truly gone too soon, I'll never forget you Schlut, Rest in please and fly high big guy 🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
Im happy Big guy is finally doing what he wants to do, I was really worried with all the reaction videos and stuff.
Can someone show me where he went live  I checked his twitch but I didn’t see it  (I’m being serious)
Who the fuck is this guy?
May J J the Schlett Plane Fly high 🛩️✈️🛫🛬
The Celsius measurement of temperature is better than Fahrenheit for various reasons. Firstly, it is easier to comprehend as it is based on the simple concept of water freezing at 0°C and boiling at 100°C, making it more intuitive for people around the world. Secondly, Celsius is considered the international standard for temperature measurement and is used in most scientific research and experiments, providing a universal language for scientists to communicate with. Additionally, Celsius scale is more precise than Fahrenheit, as smaller units of measurements can be used, which is crucial in fields like chemistry and meteorology. Lastly, Celsius is used globally, making it easier for countries to understand and communicate temperature measurements with one another, as opposed to Fahrenheit, which is only used in a few countries such as the United States, the Bahamas, and Belize.
wow the AI voices are getting almost real :,( fly high schlatt
I’ll just say this  We only give a fuck about your funny ass! We don’t give a fuck about a specific series!!!! Just make funny content!!!
Its because I tweeted a threat to shatt that if he doesn't do something besides reaction videos I will find him
Kelvin is the superior temperature scale
Thank fucking god bro i missed watching shlatts vids i haven't watched for god knows how long cause i just cabt stand the reaction videos im so glad i get to watch him do fun stuff again😭
Kelvin is best
schlatt for president 2024
RIP big guy. Ketchup belongs in the fridge but you didn't deserve to get murdered over it.
Happy birthday Schlatt
It’s almost like you’re still with us. RIP Shatt 🙏
Did schlatt make a VOD of his city skylines stream?
YES, TIER LISTS ARE BACK BABYYY
I dont care
Imperial is better for measuring length and volume too. How much is a third of a meter? Yeah.. Tell me more about why your superior measurement system can't handle basic, everyday fractions.
yknow with all the half baked games that get released from all these terrible triple A studios i have great faith in cities skylines 2 being a masterpiece like the first one its one of the only games ive looked forward to in a good while
I edge to your videos
Farenheit is in percentages. 70% hot, it's nice. 100% hot, very hot. 30%, very very cold.
Glad to see you once again switch back to what you once did
first real schlatt vid in so long alhamdullilah
Schlatt why not ban all the British people who use Celsius
i cant believe schlang died :(
It’s like he is still here 🕊️🕊️
Love that Schlatt's "Return" to making videos was just him uploading clips from a sponsored stream
Rust in peace ❤
0:54 that's actually hysterical
dont care ameriman, upload more minecraft create mod
what did you get a hair cut or something?
Rank drinks
Welcome back from prison. R.I.P. Big Guy
Sins when does he have a nigger cat
about time
What is this gay new haircut schlatt
Man, it's almost like Shlott was still with us. Rest in pieces big man  🕊🕊🕊🕊
In all seriousness, didn’t you promise this a couple years ago? What’s different this time?
Day 1  for asking jshclatt to get a pantagonia truckers hat
So glad to see Schlatt back from federal prison!! Justice has not been served!!
Wait why tf is he not allowed to leave
FINALLY
Please finish rabbits go home big guy I’m begging
Finally
just clip from the stream
Good job big man for escaping from prison
I loved Shrimp back in his prime. It's so sad to see him go so soon... fly high shimp 🕊️🕊️🕊️
Tier list please
RIP "schlatt" you will be missed 🕊🕊
the big schulangus got what he deserved.... I just wish I was the drunk driver.
reaction videos honestly make me stop watching channels i can just go watch what they are reacting to by myself and reaction channels are kind of looked down upon idk about you guys but i dont want to be seen even consuming that content
I feel bad for schabraxious cucalo's family, may he fly high🪽🕊... ❤
We’ll miss you big guy, you will forever be in our hearts 🙏🕊️
THank god
bro does not like san francisco
schlit already starting fights with the world
Pleaseeeee play more Cities Skylines 2 🙏 The best game you’ve ever played
there shouldn't be a speed limit. let natural selection do its thing
I thought he was dead. Oh wait his ghost couldn’t get out of the loop?
Nice to see you back. And by the way, I have the evidence.
I 100% agree that Fahrenheit is a much superior way to measure temperature. It's the only time i agree with the imperial system and I will stand by this. 2:23
Rest in peace schlatt you where the best 🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️
Perhaps Germany heard what you did in London last year...
fahrenheit does NOT make more sense whatsoever
Hey Shlitt hope you're doing well
I’m glad I was really sick of them
I miss schlatt so much😢 That semi truck was too much to handle for him🕊️🙏
shut up
Damn that's a lot of youtube plaques.
0:35 Could you milk me to completion?
Hey man so glad to hear that you’re thinking of doing more regular style content, long time fan so looking forward to a refreshing set of videos!
Celsius is better when doing science. Not for weather.
may he rest in peace 🕊🕊🕊 FLY HIGH AND FALL 🕊🕊
Everyone is saying that Jschlatt is dead and some say his death is a hoax, IS HE ALIVE OR NOT?! I'M SHAKING AND CRYING RN HE CAN'T LEAVE US TOO!!!
So rude of “schelat” to cut out the part where “he” admits he is wrong about the Celsius system
I remember rewatching your series on this game and it was so good. So happy to see this. Reaction content from you is actually good but you gotta do what makes you happy . Epic decision have been made
IS THAT FUCKING TAMPERE, LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOO TORILLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It feels like he still uploads rest in pieces <333 🕊🕊🕊
:)
Damn, Rest In Peace Schlong
Water boils at 100 and freezes at 0. Thats why Celsius better
Trevor lookin fine as fuk
im so sad i cant watch his content anymore he was so goated
WHY TF ARE THERE COMMENTS ABOUT SCHLATT DYING WTFF 💀🙏
we miss you jshat we love you we miss you rest easy big guy 🙏
The spiffing brit dos better
Welcome back, father finally get the milk?
We know what you did in 1999.
I really don’t care tbh
Imma research on celcius and the f one (dunno how to type it) I will make a new comment once I am done  I will ignore all bias and try using as many ups and downs for the both and you know what??? I will add kelvin too just because maybe by the end I'll think "they both suck"
Thank fucking god
He's out! <3
Whats the point on watching “schlatt”
I watched Martincitopants’ video  about him doing the crane thing so that’s nice to see
Shlatt I’ll watch anything you upload, we are here for you not the react vids, I do like your reaction vids tho😂
i cant like a video that worships fahrenheit i just cant i wont dislike either
0 degrees celsius is the freezing point of water and 100 degrees is the boiling point, it may be less effective but its easier to use
why people be pretending he s dead? what s the story behind it ?
of course he comes back on the 1 year anniversary of the queen leaving us due to foul play. Welcome back schloing.
I actually got mad at you when you stopped doing reactions live. The chaos was so incredibly funny and then when reactions were just youtube videos I stopped watching.
“This is jizz it is not a tapeworm”
What's the name of the classical song playing around 10:50?
Schlatt's next series: "ACTUALLY ranking"
NO MORE CRINGE TIK TOK POG
Wow I can't believe they're still running "Schlitt"'s channel after what happened. Fly high, big man.
This bastard is still alive? How?
Good. The reaction videos are very low effort, and really boring/ not entertaining to watch.
cant believe how far AI has come, helping us keep Shliffs memory alive. Rest in peace to Soup and Jambo’s dad, may he rule hell with an iron fist ✊❤️🕊️
Good luck but also I will miss my monthly Schlatt meme reaction
*sighs* rest in peace jurethra 😞😞 fly high big man 🕊🙏
Oh ok I thought this was something super serious, you kinda scared me there schatt
I’m glad you are still gonna do user submitted stuff cause I missed out in doing the originals and those are still very fun to watch!   I can’t wait to participate this time sround
so glad you're off the reaction stuff bro. if i'm wrong i'll sound like a forking idiot but i could tell they were fake. glad you're back big guy
That's the real San Francisco water
Dropping the sope must have been a game to you huh Big guy? ( I'm talking about prison btw )
WOO, YEAH BABY! THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR! THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT!!!!
Gonna miss those vids, anyway, welcome back from prison 👍
Thank fucking god fuck TikTok content
Rip Shlatt this AI shit is getting too real
I have to say, I've never known you well as a creator, but I respect the hell out of you. Even though you'll never see this/you won't mean much, thank you for what you've done for people like myself. It might not bee specifically but you've truly brought joy to those your videos has been viewed by and to me that's all that matters. Keep your head up king (:
Would you rather have unlimited Bacon or games unlimited games but no games.
I can’t wait to see what you keep putting out nice work big guy
I am so happy these reaction vids are gone I hated them and I’m so happy the actual video game content is back
So nice that Jshlatt cause actual Sh!t to a town. Glad your back big man
rest in peace jschlatt
I'll miss you big man, may you rest in peace.
They haven’t figured out what happened in 1999 and in 2001 🙌🏻 🙌🏻 🙌🏻 🙌🏻
Still cant believe you went to prison for protesting that pre-school graduation, glad to have you back tho✌️
No schlatt
lets game it out, and shlatt get to review the new city sky lines lmao
you are entertaining schlatt, i cant wait to see for what's to come
I really want to see what you'll do in the next months, Schlatt! Really happy to see that you're going to do what you want, tbh I was losing interest when I keep seeing tiktok reactions when you could do so much more, like that time when I ran into you and you broke both of my legs! But you didn't settle for JUST that, you had standards back in '99, so you smashed my skull with a hammer you happened to have and put me in a deep coma for 2 months, glad to see you're applying that logic to your channel as well! Keep it up!
Thank god the reaction videos are done 🙏
yo thats neat city skylines launches on my birthday
cool
This AI trend has gone too far. I almost thought schlaxevasionand3felonies was back😢😢
finally he can go back to making the same 5 jokes in sponsored streams
no measuring system is bnetter im used to mine your used to yours to me i get scared when i see big numbers then i see farenheit next to it and then im chill to you its probably different
I'm so glad "clit" got out of prison
I’m glad shlatt! Let’s goooooo! Great decision
So upsetting you had to pass away🙏🙏🙏 RIP
bro asks are u water like he's not made of 70% water. we gonna boil u little bro.
Cant wait until you start being funny again big guy 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Cant wait till he starts drunk driving again
It's so nice to see you back shit!!
So relieved that Shlarp was found not guilty due to a hung jury. Rest in piece big guy🕊️
Thank you
Imagine if he posted this and then his next vid was another tik tok video
Did you ever name the Burnt Jambo that I see in the background?
Man it seems like hes still with us. AI is getting so good at these things now, its almost like schlortt. He will be remembered for all those atrocious things he did in '99
it feels like i can still hear schlingle's voice still. fly high big guy 🕊
Thank god Schlatt. I respect the hustle but god damn were the reaction videos unbearably unfunny. I hope we get to see some more of your premium stuff now
I miss the old jschlatt
schlatt. youtube takes you for granted.😍 god i love chlaggg
I swear sometimes I can still hear scheese in my ears. RIP Big guy
Kelvin makes the most sense
I think this is the most random and entertaining video I’ve ever watched
<33333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333
We love you Schlatt. Fly high. <3
Bros posting from the afterlife
Miss you big man :(
I am so sad schlive nights at freddys passed away, fly high king 🗣️🔥🔥🕊️🕊️🕊️
ONEB 2 ?
Please, bring back Nintendo Wii games, it's realy fun!
6:00 thats literally just south africa
Shit sucks
im thanking whatever god there is LETS GOOOOO
Yes
I guess Schlatt found JJJacksfilms and doesn't want to get targeted himself lol
Bro 9/11 in three days, what do you think
MODEST CUBE SWEEP
Bring back openttd
I like that he feels the need to back up his commentary on the standard temperature measuring system in Europe with post-edit notes. The big man is having none of this bullshit.
This comment section is fucking annoying I’m just gonna say it like get a new joke or actually contribute to the community bruh
RIP
Nice video
The title made me think he was coming out of the closet.
We, European, are proud to speak in celcius! 🗣️🗣️
honestly if you just stop hamming up the character you play so much you might find content a bit more enjoyable LOL. sorry but it really is difficult to watch another loud and forced laughter reaction video and i think everyone can tell youve hated it since the beginning. just start experimenting with more things that make you happy and see what sticks, at the end of the day people are here to see YOU! doesnt matter what, people just enjoy your personality and humor. wishing u the best brotherman  <3
I'm happy for you man
the golden age of schlatt is coming, we are powerless to stop it, but if we could, i honestly dont think we should
Ok and when does water boil?  In F A H R E N H E I T
Based on a true story of San Francisco
I thought this video would be about the inevitable escalation towards nuclear holocaust.
Thank GOD
i love watching shit. Schlong is my favourite streamer
This is all we wanted, this is awsome
Celsius is a better choice than Fahrenheit due to its alignment with the metric system, making it globally standardized and easy to work with. Its logical reference points at the freezing and boiling temperatures of water (0°C and 100°C) provide an intuitive scale for everyday use, while Fahrenheit lacks such simplicity and widespread adoption, making Celsius the more practical option for temperature measurement.
Damn, AI is getting so good. Fly high big man 🕊️
I would hate to use imperial temperature in my lab where I work because no one else does it, but man would I hate celsius for day to day life. I like my room at 70 degrees, not that bastard measurement that means anything 69-71.
I can still feell J-Schliggity-Dig-Dawg as if hes just posted a video. We miss you Big guy. 🕊️🕊️🕊️
Funny mic
I so glad shart is back
damn what videos am i gonna  use on the background while i fuck now?
TREVOOOOR
It's so sad that schlatt died. Just kidding, rest in peace big guy!
He thiccc
Damn shlatty daddy, rest in peace bro. Hope you feel good on the other side 🙏🕊️
There is some intuitive sense to Fahrenheit, as I recently learned. Whereas with Celsius you need to just learn what each value feels like, you can treat Fahrenheit as a sort of percentage of how warm it feels. And honestly, as someone who knows Celsius, that's helped quite a bit in interpreting Fahrenheit, and I don't have an equivalent for explaining Celsius.
These death jokes are some of the most unfunny comments I've ever seen and good on Jschlatt for switching back to his old format
Thank you for everything man
I missed the gaming videos
YES- I WAS ABOUT TO SAY, please stop reacting to TikTok’s, we can open the app ourselves, we wanna see youuuu (no hate gang)
As an American engineer I can confirm that 100° makes more sense for water boiling
Schlatt we’re gathering evidence.
no one cares
Dunno what he means with "Fahrenheit makes for sense"
come to germany and visit me ✌
Rip 🪦
I could care less what you play or upload I just like watching you.
Happy early birthdayyyy
Its kinda funny how right he is about the not having friends part, i watch his videos every day during lunch at school as i sit by myself lmao Rest in peace schlatt, i really wish you were still here with us. You made my days so much worse 🤍
Rest in piece jschlatt, it somehow still feels like he’s here. Fly high🕊️🩷
so glad schlatts back from prison ❤️
Thinking Fahrenheit is better than Celsius is such a shit take how does 30 degrees Fahrenheit make more sense than 0 degrees Celsius, zero warmth
Schlittlor's List you will be missed 🕊 Fly high big man, RIP
Schlatt is right. Celsius works in scientific applications, but Fahrenheit is a scale of temperature according to humans. 0 is very cold. 100 is very hot. Simple.
You never paid me big guy. If you don’t within 30 days, I will release the evidence of what you did in 99’, including the photos you took.
Finally,some good food to eat,glad you stopped the TikTok videos :)
This is NOT the real Jschlatt.
as someone who lives near San Francisco, what Schlatt did is genuinely an upgrade at this point
its truly heartbreaking to hear that you passed away shlocky, you will be missed. and a big thanks to Ludwig for making and posting a AI video on this channel as a tribute to dear Schloky. Fly high big guy 🕊️♥️
bonk!
i miss the fuk out of y shlat Rip j shalt fly high September 11, 2001 at 8:14 am 🙏🕊 🪦
Love how he streamed just a week after I unsubbed from him not streaming and now I don’t have my sub streak
Well celsius is better because bucket 🪣 says so
Yes thank you I so happy
I'll have you know, "schlort", that the average human body is 60% water, so yes... I AM water asshole. Never speak to me or my son ever again. 🍶
Dan tdms dog ellie died
Yeah we know. Your reaction videos are basically your life support
Rip Jslut, fly high sexy big guy 🕊️🕊️🕊️
Am I the only one that doesn't know why Schlatt couldn't leave the country lmao
Fucking finally
It's almost like he's still with us. Miss you big guy 🙏🙏 I can't believe AI like this is possible...
You didn't include the part when a viewer tells you that we are water and we know at what temperature we boil
if I watch one more of these videos and hear "So you may be wondering" or "About a Month ago" I'll leak his IP
R.I.P🎉🎉🎉
normal city skyline youtubers would just shower the city in meteors or tsunamis when they’re done with the city. schlatt plucks everything nice from his city and turns it into hell so all the citizens can live to regret their decision to move there; optimal misery generation.
Im so happy to see that we're back to dumb gaming and shotty ranking videos 😎👍🏼
It’s like I can still here Schlatt’s voice. RIP 😭
So glad you’re out of police custody, big guy.
WOOOOOOO BAAAAAABY THATS WHAT WEVE BEEN WAITING FOR THATS WHAT ITS ALL ABOUT!!!!!!
Freedom Units got us 2 World Wars and multiple moon landings.  How many moon landings under Commie units? ZERO
I think Fahrenheit is better for the weather and stuff but celcius is better for cooking and science
I still think about ьолк
Can’t believe he got drafted into the current Ethiopian war… Fight on Scat!!!
🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️
I wonder how these are uploaded. Maybe the Jschlatt estate manages these
BRING BACK THE WII GAMES!!!!!!
schwartz died???????????????!!!!!!!!! no way
3:28 SUOMI MAINITTU
What an amotional, and moving video. Jebediah "Schlatt" will always be remembered. RIP big guy 🕊🕊🕊
fucking finally
11:19 that’s what I’m sayin !! 😂
YUAYYYYY
i can’t believe he prerecorded the video before the game was announced 😔  its almost like “Shatt” is still with us! fly high “iShatt” 🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️ 🔥 🔥 🫃 🫃
Thank god
MORE DAY Z AND TRUCK SIMULATOR TOO HOPEFULLY
Welcome back from prison! We missed you so much big guy 🙏
bro in celsius you have 0° for freezing and 100° for boiling, how is that just not better than fahrenheit's 32° for freezing and 212° for boiling or sum shi
ANOTHER SHALT VIDEO!!
WHERE IS THE SECOND CAT REVEAL?!?!??!
Still waiting to be blessed with my Schlanket
Gayvorite? Did anyone else hear him say that? 1:47
I wouldnt mind watching more shit like this
Ai is getting out of hand ❤️🕊️ shlonggy wonggy i remember seeing him in prison he kept screaming about the new york Yankees rip🕊️❤️
Schlanker, after you exposed yourself in a elementary school playground, I thought I’d never respect you ever again. But after apologizing (and announcing your OnlyFans) I’m glad to see that you’ve had a change of heart. I hope someday you earn back you’re school zone privileges and your ability to talk to minors.
big man PLEASE post videos on city skylines 2
Honestly I agree with the big man, Fahrenheit is a better temperature system and metric is the better measurement system
yippie
I miss him more everyday. Life is just not the same without him.
FINALLY YOU’VE REALIZE TICTOK IS FUCKING TERRIBLE FOR YOU. Thank you for not being a bitch and telling ur people truth. Keep glowin SHINING
Weren’t you dead?
#15 on Trending for gaming
I'm sorry that I've ever doubted you
Are you streaming in twitch or what?
Really miss Schlubic Hair. Glad his family posted this video to help us mourn the loss.
Thank you, Schlatt <3 You’ve got this.
Thank fucking god the reaction content is gone, ive been watching you for literal years and holy shit the reaction vids were the worst era by far, glad your back big man.
No they won't
I’m gonna say something right here. The only GOOD thing about Celsius is 0 being freezing point and 100 being boiling point. Everything else is fucking stupid. Schluttle was so right with saying that C° sucks ass. Think about it. If 0° C and 32° F are freezing point, then you’d think 1° C is 33° F, Right? NOPE. IT SUCKS ASS. STOP FIGHTING A LOSING ARGUMENT YALL ARE WRONG. SCHLIPPLE WAS RIGHT
glad to have the streaming back
"so please watch it" hahahahaha
Did he Diop the soap
you should rank gatorade flavors
bruh
Do what makes you happy
I live in a low income housing environment that goes by the government name of Section 8.
Its almost like hes here with us... R.I.P Schlingus
Rank gamer supps or soda
WHY THE FUCK EVERYONE SAYING HE IS DEAD
YESSSSSSS
Rip schlenis 😔😭
i've got the documents. i'll see you at new york federal prison jshit.
Been a long time fan and it broke me to hear of Jebadiah Schalts unfortunate passing…he’ll always live on in our hearts.  Big dubs to AI for letting us get new content even after his passing. Fly high big man 🕊️🕊️🕊️❤️
It really does feel like Schlong is still with us, feeling his his energy coming inside of us. May he not rest in peace for his crimes back in ‘99. Fly high big guy 🕊️🕊️🕊️❤️❤️
Shat i don't think you this but people are about 70% water
More like…. GaySplat.
Im telling you guys hes gonna switch to ranking youtube shorts
Show us more ways to make a fake passport
!
Rest in peace shlitorius, your still on the grind even when your dead.💔 miss you so much big man.
bro playing this game is just making most cities in the philippines by making roads unwalkable lol
yippee !! there best be more videos coming soon i swear
fly high big guy 🕊
Welcome back Schlatt! I've missed you! I can't wait to bust my GUT!!!
they deffo aint got much evidence lol
Glad your back salt....slta....schat......slilt...slat...schlatt yeh. Thats it.
They didn’t have enough evidence  from what he did in the 90s to make the charges stick
Wait what Schlatt is gonna quit reacting to tiktoks and go back to streaming playing games and uploading them? That's crazy but that's a change I'm fine with.
Damn more ranking videos, can't wait for big guy to showcase his unpopular opinions and infuriate the masses once again.
YESSSS I MISS THIS SCHLATT
join the fish tank
Guys water freezes at fucking 16ºF, bruh
Literally just a ad for this game
Another sjchlatt found footage?
If it isn’t an onlyfans I DONT WANNA HEAR IT
so sad how they made a ne schlatt because he is to busy dropping the soap in prison. 😢
Test in peace schlatt 🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🪦💀
casual degrees kelvin enjoyer
Gyatttt dammmmmmm
Its almost like he's still here... RIP "Schlatt"
rip schlatt. we all know the government's trying to cover up your execution. fly high big man 🕊🕊🕊🕊🕊🕊
your welcome because i rewatch every single vid on your channel when i sleep XD
thank you god i hate reaction videos
It was a great steam and a great video
youre one of my favorite people, youre so real and so funny and you help me get  through hard times. never change schlatt, thank u
lETSSSS GOOOOOOOOO
Counter argument, Fahrenheit is the temperature we use to cook food with. Are we food? I know America is all about food so makes sense in that regard at least. With Celsius it's simple, above 0 it's decent weather, below 0 it's going to snow and be very cold and stuff. Like why is 32 the "0" or what ever? Such a random number!
Finally, i cant wait for the big guy's return to what he did in '99.  I rember what you did to my family schlatt. Start running.
schlatts iq is calculated by measuring average room temperature in celcius, if its stupid, hes stupid too
They didn't want schlatt to leave the country, because exactly one year ago, he allegedly killed the queen
NO
Man I was worried 1999 caught up with him
Oh Schlatt is back from prison wooo
i know it a joke but some FYI for the kids that don't get it. you are made out of 60% water. Which translates better to how you feel in a certain temperature.
"Schlatt" shouldn't be worried about Paradox just because he made a cock and balls, they've seen much worse..
No
BIG GUY IS BACK!!!!
very excited to see whats up next, and im sure its gonna be great no matter what
How can you make San Francisco worst, it's already the bottom of the barrel.
god i hope so
Big L take
Thank you Shlattass for everything you’ve done, you will be remembered as one of the greatest YouTubers in history, fly high big guy…🕊️🪽    and may you rest in calories..😔
so glad you're back big guy! I hope prison wasn't too bad :D
I miss the old format, I stopped watching because all of your videos were just tiktok videos.
Things are about to change. AGAIN. xD
I love you schlamydia
my pride as an american instantly returns the second "schlatt" starts dissing anything remotely european
I’m so glad he recorded this before he went to prison
Im literally with you on keep Fahrenheit but get change to the metric system
Chart always manages to somehow disappoint us
Oh yeah,you're getting a gorilla lamp
5 foot is easier then temperature pol😊
of course Schalt returns on the 1 year anniversary of queen death
with Celcius you'll always know if there's chance of the snow actually staying when it's snowing in winter
Rest in power they were the only good reactions but it’s good to see you stick to your morals and not do them anymore. User submitted were better anyway
Guess they finally got you for that fateful night in '99 huh? Good to know you're out on parole... Did you make sure the basement tapes are encrypted? Fuck you for leaving for so long.
what happened to august 3rd….
NO MORE TIKTOK REACTIONS YEAAAAAAA SCHLATT MAKE CONTENT THAT YOU *WANT* YESSS
While I did enjoy the reaction vids I really liked the rankings and dayz vids the best, keep it up big guy!
I still remember when schlittle would make our days better with his presence. Rest in peace Jmingus!
Whooooo yeaaah baby, that's what we've been waiting for, that's what it's all about!
This is actually how the South African government runs our country
you are a wanted person wanted by the cia and all of them idgaf about them but you are wanted
uses the metric system to say the fahrenheit is better
Welcome back!
Kelvin is best system. No negative numbers
Yooo I’m an egg
it really is tragic to see him go, but if these ai recreations can live up to even half of his legacy, I will be sleeping well under my schlanket. Fly hi, big guy. rest in peace Schlitt
yeah i remember ur birthday is close  so mmmmm happy birthday big guy
we all just want schlatt to be happy
I know what you did in 99..... i saw it and i cant stop seeing you do it over and over again....i will find you .... always look behind you schlatt...
Love you big guy can't wait for whatever content comes next!
I feel like I still hear schlottskis voice
happi chat happy shat
Kelvin is better than all other temperature measurements....
All my homies hate Celcius.
Rip Schlatt
2:23 screw you schlatt
Don’t care. Look at this 🫃
very glad to see no more tik tok reaction videos on the channel, I have been watching your content since before even the "elon are you ok" video and those tik tok videos where the first time ive actively not wanted to watch something youve made. But money is money I would honestly do the same thing lol.
Love yeah!!
Listen if the Cops ask about 1998 YOU DOTN TALK AND SAY I INVOKE THE 5th and Call your autorney
celsius is better. change my mind.
new reaction video next week! let’s go!
Jscat
Thanks jshlatt these vids are better when your having fun!
First off, simplicity. Celsius is a breeze to understand. It's based on the freezing and boiling points of water, with 0 degrees being the freezing point and 100 degrees being the boiling point. It's a neat and logical scale that anyone can grasp. Fahrenheit, on the other hand, seems to have been concocted from some mystical formula. What's the logic behind 32 degrees being freezing and 212 degrees being boiling? It's like trying to decipher an ancient code!  Now, let's talk about scientific coherence. Celsius is widely accepted across the scientific community. It aligns with the International System of Units (SI), which is used by scientists and researchers worldwide. This consistency allows for seamless collaboration and avoids confusion when sharing data. Fahrenheit, on the other hand, is primarily used in the United States, making it an outlier on the global stage. It's like using a different currency while everyone else is using something else. It just doesn't make sense!  But wait, there's more! Celsius provides a practical advantage in everyday life. Think about it: most of the world uses Celsius. When you travel internationally or communicate with people from different countries, Celsius is the language of temperature. It's the lingua franca of weather forecasts, cooking recipes, and scientific discussions. Fahrenheit, unfortunately, limits your ability to connect with the global community. Why confine yourself to a scale that isolates you from the rest of the world?  Lastly, let's consider the ease of mental calculations. Celsius is a friend to your brain. With its intervals of 1 degree between freezing and boiling, it's effortless to estimate temperature changes. Need a quick mental conversion? Just subtract or add a few degrees, and you're good to go. Fahrenheit, on the other hand, with its uneven intervals, can leave your head spinning. Quick mental math becomes a headache, and who needs that in their daily lives?  So, my friends, it's time to embrace Celsius as the superior temperature scale. It's simple, scientifically coherent, globally accepted, and easier on our mental faculties. Let's leave Fahrenheit in the history books and bask in the warmth of Celsius. Trust me, your thermometer will thank you!
WELLLLLLL. Im like 60% water which mean celsius is 60% better than fahrenheit or sth like thta
Cant believe he us not with us anymore, R.I.P The Schlerminator❤
thank god, i hate those reaction videos i have to say your reaction videos were the lowest quality content on this site.
So glad schlitface is in a better place now🕊🕊🕊
Celsius is more stupider
RIP. fly high king 🕊️🕊️🕊️
"farenheit makes more sense than celsius" letting the queen of england live also made more sense schlatt
Go back to otk
Hang on, why was Kelvin there? Why would you need that info?
F° is more stupid lol
PARADOX GAMES GETTING THE LOVE THEY DESERVE
🧔
Kelvin >>>>>> fahrenheit, 0 kelvin is the coldest temperature you can physically reach and the kelvin scale makes all the equations work -🤓
2:30 yes infact i am
I was about to watch nikocado avocado But then you popped up
2:31 We are made of water though
I really hope this isn’t bad news I’m watching an ad to give shalt money
I was like wha? Then I realised I have watched the whole stream like😢😂
Wtf is a Fahrenheit !!?    😁
Schlatt We watch and love all the shit you make, doesn't matter if its reaction content, chill vlogs in japan or big projects Your energy and personality is sick and that's why we're following you Big Guy
1:10 dude im so fkn happy
Pain
I'm glad soul helpped Schlatt keep out of the dog pound... again, anyway good to see ya back big guy.
Yeah nobody needs to give a shit about boiling at 100° but I live in Canada so knowing Freezing is at 0° makes it a hell of a lot more obvious when it's cold and when IT'S COLD.
Bro I think I legit commented on the fact that he looked more dead inside each thumbnail lol
I legit don’t care
love how 99% of the comment section is gaslighting people (including schlatt himself) into thinking he's dead
Seriously so so glad to have Schlatt back doing what he loves, I personally wasn’t a fan of the reaction content (to each their own) but I could tell it wasn’t what Schlatt wanted to do, he talked about something similar a while ago in regards to doing what we wanted vs what the people wanted, so glad to have you back dawg I’m excited for the new content!!!
CELCIUS IS KING, WHAT THE HELL IS A FAHRENHEIT!!?!?
I love how the coment section says jschlatt died when in the first place jschkatt does not exist
Super happy to hear you're moving away reaction content
Celsius is stupid, I agree. -Silly European dude
Thank you, honestly. I miss the variety that I love with your content!
Dude, if you live in a place with snow and price in the winter, 0 for freezing point of water just makes sense
forgot how funny he is
Understandable, Have a Nice Day.
Rest in peace schlatt
I’m sorry schlatt, but as an American the Metric system is the best way to measure anything. 0 degrees is freezing, 100 is boiling. Once you use Celsius and convert, you’ll understand what certain degrees Celsius feels like and begin to have little to no objections
I can finally subscribe again fucking hell
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOO!
YOURE NOT TRICKING ME INTO COMMENTING WHY MY CELCIUS IS BETTER THEN YOUR FAHRENHEIT
i thought this was an apology video
so great ur back from prison buddy<3. missed you
You know the video is serious when schlatt doesn't have his Yankee hat on
about celsius, no essay, you're just wrong. :) welcome back big guy
Finally
Oh cool
Please run out of money soon 🙏
I still think it’s prison
Please make the next title "I changed my mind goodbye" but it's a completely normal video except for the title
Big guy’s out of prison 🙏🏼 love to see it
new bonk city II?
Im happy we got shatt back
Rip technoblade
YEAH NO REACTION VIDEOS THANK GOD
What happened to good boy
The AI is so accurate. If only Schlungo was still her with us… 🕊Fly high Big Guy
Looking forward to the new content, keep it up big guy
When I heard Schlatt we being sponsored by paradox, I figured it was more likely the crypto scam. I stand corrected.
schlatt, do what makes you happy, real fans will stick around
I remember when jschlatt said schlatting time and schlatted all over the schlanket, RIP big guy :(
Thank god for no more Tik tok videos I hate them so much
Im very Glad, love seeing you back at your passion :D love ya schlatt
Shlinkle dong is the male equivalent to hrh collection
Lol Celsius is not just about water boiling at 100 degrees, the logic with celsius is at 0. negative means shit starts freezing, above 0 water is fluid. And using water to set a scale just makes sense cuz water is everywhere, while fahrenheit used "brine" and idek what that is, turns out it's water with salt in it...which makes the water harder to freeze...so that dude just threw salt in water and then lowered the temp until it froze eventually, decided that was 0 degrees fahrenheit. like what?? and then he decided pure water freezes at 32 degrees and boils at 212. after setting his scale with salted water. Makes sense why the US uses this system, cuz it's goofy
The title of the video sounded like Shlatt became president and is making an announcement
The real reason Schlatt stopped reacting to Tiktoks is because he keeps seeing the person who repeatedly rizzes him up and bites his lip halfway through.
wow. my choice to follow the channel last week was insanely fortuitous
hey schlateral you think you'll make a dayz video some day?
tbh, i couldnt care what anybody says, celsius is just 10x easier, when its hot its above 0 degrees, when its cold, its below it, it just makes more sense
YES FUCK TIKTOK
1-2 degree in fahrenheit is kinda noticible but still very close to feeling the same 3-4 degrees in fahrenheit is noticible almost immediately without being super different. 2 degrees in celcius is the difference between a hot room and a cool bed. 4 degrees in celcius is the difference between my sweaty ass after working out and the glass of ice water i drank 6 years ago.
You can't be hiding much longer schlatt.
Hell yeah and nuh uh 2:05
hell yeah, lets goooooooo!!!
bro looks like a meatball
Metric is better get fked
seeing americans coping with celsius vs fahrenheit is always funny. Try as you might, it never will be right ;)
Can't wait for the "about to change" acr 🙏
2:30 he cutted out the part in which he admitted after wards that it makes kinda sense. lol
Collab with jerma guy
Dude who streams video games and reacts to tiktoks thinks he has an valuable opinion on what temp measurement is better lol.
Americans whining about Celsius is as boring as people who still debate about pineapple over pizza. It's so overdone.
Based
youve underestmated me i can just press the unsubsricbe button
Can't believe it's been almost 3 years since I found the 'awful Jackbox' videos. It's been so quiet since the accident. Fly high, big guy!
It’s almost like he’s still here, fall low king 🤍
6:27 Honestly, death increased after what Jschlatt I did in 1999.
Super glad Schlatt is free from British prison for iceing Lizzy and returned to America for the 911 Anniversary I was starting to think he was gone forever
I can’t wait for September 11 part 2 in city skylines 2 this is a W
I'm so glad the other board members of gamersupps finally voted to approve your supervised gaming time.
oh, man. he really shouldn't have called fahrenheit better than celsius; he might still have been here with us... fly high, "shat"🕊
Schlatt we watched you play fucking rabbids we don’t give a shit what you do just do what you want and we’ll probably watch
This is prerecorded, he is in prison
yeah I figured
Schlatt milks content just like his fans milk old jokes for likes. Truly a beautiful and compatible community ❤😭
Hey
celsius/ metric is always superior :D
RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANKIIIIIIIIIIIIING GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH
ai is getting very accurate these days, rest well schlatt. ai can never truly replace you.
How the fuck does Fahrenheit make more sense 0 degrees water freezes 100 degrees water boils how does that not make more sense than 32 degrees it freezes and 212 degrees it boils. those are the most random fucking numbers ever because they were made after Celsius.
JAMBO WAS EATING OTHER GUY
This ai vid looks very realistic
BUT I LOVE THE REACTIONS
Damn I can’t believe he’s really gone😢 fly high brother 🕊️🪦
1999 WILL NOT FORGIVE YOU, SCHLATT! YOU ESCAPED FROM PRISON, BUT YOU CANT ESCAPE FROM YOUR MIND, SCHLATT...
This might sound cheesey, but I am very glad you are moving on from reaction content. I always loved your videos, and I am happy we will get more of your creative content. I was sad when you started doing reaction since I always felt you were someone that put a lot of effort into your stuff, and It didn't feel true to the stuff you usually do.
Hey "Schlatt", good to see you back man. But remember Ricky? Ricky Madradzo? yeah he's heaving some pest problem and we thought you know someone for the job just like you did back in 99. The good ol days...so many dead rats
bro the tier lists were good just do more of them
I’m going to be honest schlatt… I was getting so sick and FUCKING TIRED of those reaction vids. So now that you posted this video, I feel fucking better. Thanks big guy
Shlag is dead!?
This is exactly what schlatt would've done if he was alive
a-fucking-men big guy
Celsius is useful for cooking, but farenheit is more intuitive for weather.
Oh great... he's back.. again... for the 10000th time 🤦‍♂️ u staying or going chief?
2:02 Introduction  The Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature scales are two widely used systems for measuring temperature. While both have their merits, this essay will argue that Celsius is superior to Fahrenheit for several compelling reasons. Celsius, also known as the Centigrade scale, is a metric system unit of temperature measurement used by the vast majority of countries worldwide. Fahrenheit, on the other hand, is mainly used in the United States and a few other countries. The adoption of the Celsius scale as the global standard would promote consistency, simplicity, and ease of scientific communication.  Metric System Consistency One of the most significant advantages of the Celsius scale is its alignment with the metric system, which is the international standard for measurement in science and everyday life. The Celsius scale is based on water's properties, with 0°C as the freezing point and 100°C as the boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure. This alignment makes conversions between Celsius and other metric units, such as meters, liters, and grams, straightforward. In contrast, the Fahrenheit scale is based on arbitrary reference points, making it less compatible with the metric system and impeding efficient scientific calculations and conversions.  Ease of Scientific Communication Scientific research and communication rely heavily on standardized units and measurements. Celsius provides a common ground for scientists across the globe to share data and findings without the need for constant conversions. This universal standardization is critical for international collaboration, as it streamlines the exchange of information and promotes scientific progress. By using the Fahrenheit scale, the United States creates unnecessary barriers to international scientific cooperation and makes it challenging for researchers from different countries to work together seamlessly.  Simplicity and Intuitiveness Celsius offers a more intuitive temperature scale for everyday use. The Celsius scale is centered around the freezing and boiling points of water, making it more practical for people to relate to everyday experiences. A temperature of 20°C is readily understood as a pleasant room temperature, while 100°C represents the boiling point of water. In contrast, the Fahrenheit scale's reference points, 32°F for freezing and 212°F for boiling, are less intuitive and make everyday temperature comparisons more complex. This lack of intuitive understanding can lead to confusion, especially for those not familiar with the Fahrenheit scale.  Gradual and Logical Progression The Celsius scale features a logical progression of temperature values. As you move up or down the scale, each degree represents an equal change in temperature. In contrast, the Fahrenheit scale has a less uniform progression, with smaller increments near freezing and larger ones near boiling. This non-linearity can make it challenging to gauge temperature changes accurately, leading to errors in interpretation and decision-making.  Global Consistency and Environmental Impact The adoption of the Celsius scale as the global standard would promote consistency in various industries, including meteorology, aviation, and international trade. A unified temperature scale would simplify international communication and cooperation and reduce the risk of misunderstandings and errors. Additionally, using Celsius can have a positive environmental impact. Standardization on a single temperature scale would reduce the need for dual-scale thermometers and other measuring devices, thereby decreasing waste and conserving resources.  Conclusion  In conclusion, the Celsius scale offers numerous advantages over the Fahrenheit scale, making it the superior choice for temperature measurement. Its alignment with the metric system, simplicity, and logical progression make it a more practical and universal option for scientific, everyday, and international use. The global adoption of Celsius as the standard temperature scale would promote consistency, streamline scientific communication, and simplify our lives while benefiting the environment. It is high time for the world to embrace Celsius as the preferred temperature scale for a more connected and efficient global society.
Thank you shlatt for moving the world trade center in 2001, a true hero. we owe you our lives.
Why is there still a bird ? Should be an x
Im so impressed that schlortt invented a new temperature measurment
Schlatt looks like Pedro Pascal
Is he gonna start making actual content again? Probably not much
oh wow, he remind password from google wow
Schlump city
FINALLY!!! TIKTOK REACTS IS OVER!! Was happy to see them just missed your other routine
Guys let's go hes back from prison, welcome back big guy
When the music came up when talking about the monolith, the music from 2001 a space oddity, that shows that schlatt is WAY smarter than the character he plays, and I find the fascinating. I hope we see "intellectual schlatt" or as I will call him, "dr. schlatt" more often.
I am very happy to see your games
Sometimes it feels like he’s still here with us ❤😢
Nothing like watching some good shat glad you got out of prison
I have to say this as a finnish person but. TORILLE!!! SUOMI MAINITTU
Will the changes be as impactful as to what happened in 1999, schlatt?
every system > us system
Fly high big guy, I'm a big fan since September 11, 2001. We will miss you my G! 🥶😓😓🕊️🕊️🕊️
'you see, a little over a year ago... (i killed the queen)'
jschlatt is just too lazy to remeber thats why he is salty xD
RIP Big guy fly high and stay high.❤
Everyone left, Just like real California.
Every EU user has left the chat
no mebeab? im not watching this
NO MORE SLOP? BASED
Didn't expect "Not just bikes" here!
Rest in peace😢
HOW THE FUCK do you actually think fahrenheit makes more sense
"I'ts So "EaSy, WateR BoIlS At 100! Are you water??"  Yes!! We are 78% water you shlobotomite
So glad you're back from prison, missed you big guy❤
yes!! this makes me so happy! as much as we love your reactions i and many others could tell you just werent feeling it. we all support whatever content you want to make!!
No jschlatt they don't have enough evidence
guys I think things are about to change idk tho
welcome back jace shat! ❤❤❤
this was so unbelivablely chaotic
Hi schlagg, the last time you uploaded a video I wasnt thinking about joining the Army. Now I've contractually bonded myself to the army till 2029
glad you beat the allegations big guy
The only guy to do 5 "I'm back" videos
Gonna miss ya schlatt fly high my angel 😇🕊️🕊️
editor is imposter fr
As long as we still get sleep deprived videos
so glad schlatt finished his mass orphanage detonation project!!! happy to have you back big guy!!! 💯💯
the body is about ~80% water schlatt maybe you wanna be careful
I prefer celsius because i dont usually check the temperature when going out. I mostly use it for cooking.
He died in prison... Rest in peace schlatt 😢
Rest in peace, you will be missed 💔
i love ur void cat
*m o n o l i t h*
R.i.p big guy[*] 😔💔🙏
I missed you shlit
Shlit is joe bidan
holy shit finally
finally no more tiktok reactions
Yeah martincitopants was on the crain
i love how he cut out the part where he ends up agreeing that celsius is better than fahreinheit
Said every parent
i hope you end your channel
This comment section is copy paste brain rot
In all serious though celcius is way better than farrenheight
Rest in peace shlatt 🙏
Im super excited! This is so cool dude, i hope you actually enjoy making stuff
No bruh those was my favorite
no more reaction videos finally
Fahrenheit is STUPID because its based on a fucking salt ice water brine solution thing and the temperature of a german man's armpit, why not just water?? Thats so much better
Schlatt I really don't give a fuck about your happiness. Get back to reacting or else no mush for tonight. 🔫
YES FINALLY YOU’RE BACK TY IVE MISSED YOUR STREAMS  RAHHH
“Are you water” yes I’m 60% water
Schlatt post another Cities Skylines video please 🙏
Good for you big man❤
Celsius is better.
i appreciate the moral code. refreshing. does this mean more weeklyslap?
Glad the reaction videos are done cause I hated them it made me stop watching
yay no more tiktok
A light from our family is gone A voice we loved is stilled A place is vacant in the home Which never can be filled  We have to mourn the lost of one We would've loved to keep But God who surely loved him best Has finally made him sleep After a lifetime of his love and joy And music to fill our ears God leaves us with these wondorous memories To help us with these tears  REST IN PEACE SHINGLES 🕊💔
just came here to say, screw clickbait titles like this, peace.
I miss the dayz streams
NO I WANT MORE RACTION
OMG THANK GOD FOR THIS I HATED THE TIKTOK STUFF
You milked the format to completion like all the men you sleep with
didnt paradox create hoi4
schlonkus please give me free energy crack cocaine in blue flavour
Can’t believe schlot is back truly makes me happy but I still can’t forgive him on September 1999-
HYPED to see more rating videos, I fucking love those things and have re-watched them all several times.
happy birthday!!
2:23 All Science students will now group together and proclaim Kelvin superiority
I unsubscribed because of those comments about celsius
THANK GOD I hate TikTok react videos I think it really holds your comedy back so I can’t be more happy about this
Hi Schlatt, thanks for letting us know Love your videos.
We can never forget what Schlongg did back in that faithful day. I know you have my portable airstrike Shligg
Tomorrow is your birthday big man…..hope you enjoy my surprise :)
i cant be the only one who noticed the reference to the animation at 1:33
2:30 I am 70% water, yes
They finally released you from the uk prison for the queen, good on you schlatt, loved your Japan vending machine vlog
In all seriousness, I appreciate Schlatt for thinking about himself rather than milking it all to narnia.
Schlatt really pre-made content for us so we could enjoy it even though he is still residing in Alcatraz. 🙏❤
Celsius all the way, none of that  32 degree freezing point bullshit
goddamn he is back
More Wii videos!
Schlatt looks like a mix of Pedro Pascal and Chris Pratt
I know it this man digging his grave
Shloob
PLEASE NO MORE TIKTOK VIDEOS
YYEAAAHHHHHHSSSSSS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The AI is so powerful now it can simulate big guy. How could you disrespect this mans passing😢
Shluggalug managed San Francisco better than the government ever has.
so glad you're back from the gulag 🙏🤑
Yes we are water Schlatt
Kelvin is the most superior temperature scale
Bro really thinks Fahrenheit is superior to Celsius... Unsub
1:06 NOOOOOOOOO
FINALLY
2:32 W
So glad the Viewer sent content is what the reactions are going back to
cool plywood wall lmao
Hell yeah, Farenheit is better than Celcius
Celsius is only good for science and cooking and you can't change my mind.
1:59 oh I remember that.
Still couldnt realize that Big Guy shatt is dead.  RIP and wait in Heaven for us 🕊️🕊️🕊️
While im gonna miss those videos congarts
AI is getting ridiculous. I felt like a kid again watching Schlazz teach me how to ride a bike. Ya never forget your first time.😔  Fly high Big guy 🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️
0:14 *PERFECT!* 👏😂
Hi schallnt
Ok.
Can we get some o7's ... this duplicate of schlatt is clearly trying to cover the passing of schlatt... he will be missed o7
I'm from Europe and sclatt is right.
why does he have 1.69 face 😢 instead of 1
If only he posted this 3 days later.
Jschlatt unironically a better mayor than 90% of the mayors in America
Schlontt is back on track!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Schlatt fans stay winning because every piece of content this man makes is pure gold. We’re here for the ride!
RANNNNNNNNNKKKKKKKKKKKKKKIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGG
Don't worry guys, someday I'll become a detective and find evidence         11 December 2047
Lollllll
It's heartbreaking to see such a positive figure in youtube pass on like this. Thank you for prerecording these videos for us, so even in death we may celebrate your short but beautiful life. Fly high big guy. ❤❤❤🕊🕊🕊
🎉
Ayee
CELSIUS IS JUST BETTER  Farenheit is like "oh yeah its 30000000000 degrees" when its freezing cold.  water boils at 100 degrees, that makes sense as a baseline. in farenheit ITS 212 DEGREES WHAT????? thats so weird. and 0 degrees celsius is a cold but not too cold temperature. if you like farenheit youre delusional.
I sometimes feel like hes still alive....   the ai is too advenced
You should make a video about lube, just lube, I need to just see you swim in lube, please
Celsius is so much better
Real chads set their temperature to kelvin.
Damn ai these days keep getting better and better. Keeping his memory alive, fly high big man 🕊️
Celsius is all I know :(
love it schlatt imma watch u more again \
9:00 You can tell how passionate you were for this dream as you spoke it out into the world.
Glad you’re back from prison shnat!
All jokes aside, I love this step forward
let's goooo
AIs are getting so good, it's like he's still with us.
9:24 bro gave himself away 💀
ive noticed the fake reactions recently pretty unwatchable thanks for making the decision easier
Why are people saying that Jslut has died? I know it’s a joke, but why? 🤔
ur podcast is gud enough also big projects are your best
wow, his rant on celsius and how fahrenheit is superior showed just how fucked this guy really is. Truly sickening individual.
Schlatt is back babyyy 👏👏👏
:c
the schlatt has fallen
It's peak... I'm peaking...
Schlatt I do not care about what you think is better or not. That's your opinion, and mine is that Celcius just makes more sense and is easier to understand, just like the metric system.
Could rank water bottles
way to recognize when to move forward. I too was cool with the reaction stuff for the longest time. Especially streamed it makes more sense. Even before the shift with xqc It was definitely getting stale.
Thank goodness man good on you
he's back!!! its almost like the real thing. RIP big guy
It's like I can still hear him, like he's still here.   Rest easy Big Guy 🕊️.
it feels like he is still with us 😭🙏
Mate your mental for thinking celceuis is bad I unsub now you special gorilla.👿👇🏿🤛🏿👁️🫦👁️
Glad to see that the tiktok content is gonna slow down, didnt particularly enjoy it after the third one. On to bigger and better things! Take care Schlattberg!
This is one big ad
LESS GOOO
Finally, a place slightly better than Cleveland
BRILLIANT VIDEO
lore accurate jersey
Thank fucking GOD. I hate reaction videos with a passion. I've been subscribed to your channel for a few years at this point, but I haven't clicked on a single video you've made in the past six months.
Thank you for bringing us this video of schlatt you materialised for us to try and keep us happy god😔 rest well jshart❤
Another legend lost this year… Rest in Peace Big Man💔
Fahrenheit is not superior its shit
Really missed the ranking stuff, watch it on repeat cuz it makes me laugh and I need new shit for it 😤
you have such beautiful hair
schlut....human blood boils at 100'c too XD
farenheit sounds like a foot condition, celsius sounds like a big beefy greek god. big ol hunk big big hot greek man
fucjk you, those were the best
Didn't Martincitopants go on the crane?
just a note on the whole "which tempreture measurement should be used???"  celcius is better for science fahrenheit it better for whether  (in my opinion)
No more meebib?
I agree on the Fahrenheit thing
here is an idea for a vid : starfield
I deadass didnt even realize that all the reaction videos where pretty much the same thumbnail (like every reaction video ever). Im glad schlatt is done with reactions tho. Hes a very creative and ambitious guy, and i think he does much better in videos that dont have a status quo or videos where he has to force a reaction to a meme.
nah screw these comments, ofc bro posts this on 9/11
nah bro Kelvin better
Schlatt being denied access out of the country after rating shitty tiktoks for 7 months is proof that karma is real
Rest in peace:(
i clicked off the video when you hated on celsius, you just lost a valuable subscriber.
Rest in peace big guy🕊️🕊️
when are you going to tell us what happened in 1999?
I'm super super happy of this change
So glad the stupid fucking tiktok videos are over
i can confim *things are about to change*
Crazy how they finally got Schlortt with the death penalty after what he did in 1999, We'll always miss the big man, fly high 🕊️
I heard the funeral will be on September 11th at 40°42′42″N 74°00′45″W, RIP big guy fly high🫡
Bro got that lightskin stare in the thumbnail
As if he is stil with us😥. When will this AI crap stop? Let the man rest in peace🙏.
We miss You Big Gay 🕊️
Thank goodness they released Schlatt from prison. 🙏🏼 God is real
Good to know Scholt is being revived with AI ❤
This was a mogal move
Hey Schlatt, you might not see this but I have to say thank you. Ever since I watched a certain video from your weekly slap called "Make your bed." I unironically started being productive again. My parents and brother are happy with my progress. Thank you for motivating me! That's all.
Schlatt as someone who has seen the decline in passion with reaction videos, I’m very happy to see you going to what you feel happy about once again. Not one for parasocial relationships, but I’m legitimately proud and you are an inspiration to those that feel stuck in a loop with no way out <3
Does this mean that Волк will be back?
We need more weekly slap
Love the video! But honestly, Celcius is superior. Like "are you made of water?" - yes, Schlitt - we are 60 to 80% water. And guess what, we are also encased in skin and clothing. Which, technically supposed to make it less accurate, but you know what is even less accurate? - Trying to mimic human blood for temperature measurements while ignoring flesh, skin, and clothing! Fahrenheit was an idiot for that. Like who the hell needs to mimic blood when in fact we are not just goddamn blood buckets in the open air, and even if we were our blood temperature doesn't even stay at 36°C (97-99 for F fans) all the time nor depending on the region. Like limbs can literally tolerate close to freezing temperatures while even our core body can safely go a few degrees below plus survive 10s degrees Celsius and still be reanimated. It's like blood is not the only thing to determine the weather. And even if that was the only goal wasn't it literally easier to encase the blood of a pig or a rat in a glass tube to measure temperature rather than trying to mimic it with far more expensive and harder to get, especially at that time chemicals? Fahrenheit literally doesn't make sense. Now with water, it's actually easier. Since we actually get it that we are not just water, we don't expect to turn into ice cubes at 0 or evaporate into nothing at 100. No, we understand that our sweet spot given weather and clothing is around 20 degrees and that is all we have to keep in mind to be comfortable, like that is it! We also understand that 0 is not a goddamn end of measurement and things go beyond that. We think in -100 to 100 scale. It is like I would be roughly as uncomfortable experiencing +50 as -50 no matter the clothing. I also know that I can go beyond that and with the right conditions and settings I can survive just a little at 100 or above it and at or below -100, and in between the -50/50 and -100/100 range. It literally makes sense. That's like the true limit even when you like nude you know the 0 to 50 range is the max you can hold. In Fahrenheit, it doesn't make sense. Oh 70 is nice, but 50 is not, and 0 is way too cold while 32 is where the weather changes most for some goddamn reason, while 100 is not the limit and you can pretty much bunch of room to live up to 150, getting into real risk of certain death above that. See, it doesn't make sense. Water on the other hand, either accidentally or specifically works well to describe weather just as to be used in science, because - you know, temperatures are used to measure other things than human comfort outside. Fahrenheit on the other hand sucks for anything other than weather. Like how am I supposed to cook at 350°F? Is too low, or too much? On the other hand, when I take 150 to 200 °C I can at least imagine something based on the fact I observed water boiling every goddamn time I am making a tea. I am not however cooking steak thinking of how I would feel in its place.
i really loved watching each tiktok reaction video with my friends when they came out, sad to see it end but its for the greater good (ty jschlork for the funny videos)
He should have had a toll booth when they left the city.
The almost genuine side of Schlatt is amazing
War is over
could you start a beta minecraft series? just going back to beta 1.7.3? or even just one long stream would be cool too
Since I heard Fahrenheit described as “how hot you feel on a percentage scale” I’ve grown to understand and appreciate it better. While I will remain using Celsius due to it being what I’m used to and making more scientific sense, I will concede that Fahrenheit has its place.
Joke comments aside, Schlatt I'm glad you're doing what you want to do and what you enjoy. I watched the tiktok reactions, but they never had the same feel as some of your other content did. I'm glad you can be honest with us and I love your streams big man
Now play it completely in russian
Last time they let him leave the country the Queen of England died.
Honestly super glad to hear this. I’ve never liked reaction content, and when I returned to your channel a while back, only to be met by a ton of TikTok reactions, I got kinda sad.  It’s gonna be great seeing more of you :)
its scary how realistic ai is.. i almost thought this was jshat. fly high big guy 🕊🕊🕊🕊🦢🙏🙏
Aye
So nice of "Shelt" to still "Upload" "Videos"
THANK GOD THE TICKTARDATION IS OVER
Can’t believe he’s gone just like x, taken too soon, fly high 🕊️
Can’t believe Schlatt escaped from big prison…again
This guys an actual fucking genius. Love you big guy
He's about to change the New York skyline again
Finally
thanks
Thank god for the end of TikTok reactions. I like the other reaction videos much better. TikTok is a scourge upon the earth. So glad to see you doing more variety
OH YEAH BABY‼️‼️‼️ RANKING VIDEOS‼️‼️ WWWW
Hey, mad respect for staying dedicated  But thank God because those videos were getting really old big guy.
Jebediah Schlatt is the only person I know who held two funerals
mmm feet
bust on you
☹️
My only reaction is this: MR.Krabs NAME IS EUGENE!?!
man, so sad to hear ur closing ur channel
Celsius is good for science because it’s just kelvins (true temperature) minus 270 something. Good for science stuff. Not superior, just fills a good niche.
Sounds good. Love you big guy, good to see you back
honestly from the bottom of my heart im so glad hes done w the same videos hes been doing, im so excited to get some new content thay reminds me of his pre tiktok era, even tho those were still great video. really missed ya big guy
pleaseee make more tier lists
Celsius outweighs Fahrenheit by FAR, put this into perspective, if 0 degrees Celsius is 32 Fahrenheit then if I was to add 0 degrees Celsius and 0 degrees Celsius together that would make 64 degrees Fahrenheit????? NO, BECAUSE FAHRENHEIT DOSENT MAKE ANY SENSE AND ITS FOR IDIOTS
All the br*tish infants crying about their dogshit temperature measurement “system”
Almost seems like hes here with us. Fly high sloog
I need more tier lists 😈
ah
I just gotta say that you look very handsome.
Schlatt its 2:43 am  Hi
you didnt include the part where you said that the chat won and celsius is better
Would you rather have reaction videos but no streams or no reaction videos and no streams
Noob
9:51 Had anyone noticed the shape of the city 💀💀
"Are you water?" Yes. 70% of every human is water. Its pretty fucking important
I'm truly grateful Schlatty Daddy is back from rehab, can't wait for more of his wonderful content
Missed ya big guy
So nice of “Schlatt” to combat climate change by turning off the power for a while.
Schlatt and this game is such a good mix ive missed this
This is why I use the ouch system. If it burns your flesh off it’s good enough to drink(:
Shlort is still alive! Another certified shlort classic
Great to see jshlurp is out of prison! Miss the big guy
Hs someone who uses metric and Celsius,  he kinda right do... (Fahrenheit makes more sense)
I'm so glad hes doing what he actually likes doing now, instead of just pumping out numb content for the algo. I hope he puts up more of those silent ambience vids on schlagg, because when he puts out vids he enjoys, it shows. thank you big guy for sticking to what you wanna do. i hope it continues to be fruitful.
fahrenheit=better
dumb bastard finally came back to us
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you'll hear. Everyone, including you and me, has sinned and falls short of God's glory (Romans 3:23). And because the wages/punishment of sin is death (Romans 6:23), you are headed for Hell for eternity. But because God loves you, He graciously offers you the gift of Eternal Life through Jesus Christ. Jesus, as God in the flesh, died for your sins on the cross. He took the punishment you deserve, and He rose again on the 3rd day. If you believe this and confess that Christ is Lord, then you are saved (Romans 10:9,10),  and regardless of what you may have done, there is no condemnation for you if you are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1). You are saved by what Jesus did on the cross, not what you do. Salvation is simple and free. "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life."
Return of the king
That's it, you're seriously one of my top fav youtubers EVER Schlatt. You're like Markiplier but you don't make movies and you have way more facial hair
i love schlatt. i wish i could schlick his schlott or see his schlussy
2:29 "ARE YOU WATER?!" I dunno why that cracked me up just the way he said it
fahrenheit is better. its like the perfect medium between the burning hot temperature measurement and the freezing cold temperature measurement why else would it be made. also its units are smaller than celsius and kelvin making it more precise and on point
God rest Jonthan Scat’s beautiful soul 🫡🫡 he will be missed
San francisco is already bad enough I live there, we got them waymos and cruise's transporting us around wihtout drivers 😭
THANKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
BASED. I'm here for it man.
it like schlitler came back to life....good riddance..🕊
This man ate my son
it looks the same as city skylines 1
Thank god joly shit
I'm so glad Schlatt impregnated my table, now I don't have to buy another table!
Well played, Cricket boy, well played…
We all gonna pretend Schlibbles didnt just say city skylines is his Gayvorite game?
Thank god schlag is no longer In federal prison
I’m glad schlatt has had *time to think* about the direction his channel is moving in
Dispte that "schlatt" is now dead, its good "he's" happy with "his" content.
Finally
Dam this is tragic. Knew he would be in prison, but RIP
And after all this, he still made San Francisco better than it is irl
2:31 erm is anyone gonna tell him? or should I
W
buddy is out of pocket for saying fahrenheit is better
Yeah honestly I didn't watch a single one of the tiktok reactions because they looked so fucking dumb so this is great news
"Schmidt", we missed you. Hopefully your prison time taught you a lesson or two about how to act around live explosives.
RIP, may the families of the 1999 incident victims rest easy 😔
Schlatt shouldn't be handed such powers
I’m really glad that schlatt came back after stabbing me in the jugular, it was such a great fan experience
I’m so happy that he’s back from prison god bless everyone
AI is getting too realistic, it’s almost like he’s still here with us.. RIP “Schlatt” 😔
We should have Schlatt actually rebuild and reconstruct Sam Fran to look like that in real life💀 can’t wait for more Schlatt content👏
Looking forward to some great shit big guy, glad you're back, or at the very least trying to be.
Jshatt himself is back
As a human, I am approximately 60% water so Celsius makes perfect sense.
First off, that’s a magazine, second off, it’s chambered in 7.62x39, third off, it’s a rocking motion
super excited for whats coming next, i recently discovered you and u are genuinly very entertaining ( i also saw all of did schlatt win)
I wish he was still here man, fucking miss him 😢
Dang bro RIP Schlatt, AI gettin too real these days
Play some dayz big guy
Glad to see the tik toks go.  After Jacksfilms started his bash on Sniperwolf I figured that the reaction series on this channel was probably unethical too (unless Schlatt got permission to show all of those, which I don't think happened but I don't know for sure)
They freed my boy "schlatt"
schlatt always manages to fill me up with fun content every time
gayvorate? awesome
This is why we love the Big Man
Smash
LLESSSSSGOOOOOOOOO
welcome back schlatt.
glad ur back schlatt hope u have fun!
love the fact that this video gets 1m views
Jokes aside, glad to have the big guy back, especially doing something you actually enjoy doing, lookin forward to all the new stuff you are bringin
thank fuck man, love your content, but ive missed seeing anything but tiktok reactions 💀💀💀
whats up with the cryptic ass title
our dumb temperature measuring system is better than yours 😢
I like how a bag of watery flash tells other bags of watery flash that the temperature of water doesn't matter. x)
I’m really happy that you’re turning away from TikTok reactions but still reacting to your own fan submissions. That way it’s not stealing content and it’s more of a community activity.
It’s almost time schgagg… the towers are waiting…
i took the like when i hear Fahrenheit is better
NOOOOO TIK TAK NOOO
schlatt I think this is an awesome video so glad you are still alive and with us
Too bad he can’t make videos for us anymore… But it’s almost like he’s still here with us, thank you editor for making an ai schlut so we aren’t alone in bed after his passing. 😩 🗿  EDIT: 🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️
I'm not really updated on the jshlatt lore but i went to the comments to say big W cus your quitting this painful way of content creation and actually switching to something you have fun doing but what i got was people saying rest in peace and people saying you are in prison im so confused
how does it feel like to freeze water at 32 degrees, huh?
finally
NUH UH?!
I know where Jambo was on September 11, 2001!!!
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH HELL YEAH, Go SCHLATT!
im so happy rn i stopped watching schlatt cause i couldnt stand watching the reaction videos
This place is gonna be a lot different tommorow.
Fahrenheit forever.
ur wrong and like women got em
This is actually very exciting, I’ll definitely be watching much more and will try and tune into some streams. Best of luck and hope you’re doing well big man 🫡
oh finally
The arc has ended
This is the most epic schlatt vid ever I’ve been waiting for this vid forever ❤❤❤
Thank God
January 17th. April 9th. December 30th. You can probably guess the Year.
Welcome Bach my schligga
JacksFilms saves the day. Gawd Bles
Honestly glad that schlong is back from bombing a village and that he’s probably alright from the fentanyl donkey incident in April of 1954
I am glad schlatt is back from his 25 year prison sentence, and has learned from the mistakes he made in 1998
Why don’t you make a separate channel for reactions?
mongongus
hes always got that smug look.
Well, that's disappointing.
BIGMAN!! IS BACK!!!!
As much as the tiktok vids made me laugh, seeing you do stuff that you actually enjoy is even better.  I'm looking forward to new stuff!
The objective correct measuring system is kelvin. I use Fahrenheit, but I wish we all used kelvin
His spirit will be with us for eternity... Rip Schlanal🕊️🕊️🕊️🪦
They queen died a year ago today
Coincidently posted on the 8th hmmm
Lol
Schlump City
ok but seriously thank god he stopped that entire series of tiktok reaction videos was funny slop
Don't know if you'll ever see this but I'm proud of you big guy so what makes you happy and the I'll watch ❤❤❤
Ofc mfs gonna post today 💀 he knows what he's doing
I finally understand. He built a Time Machine and he has been going back to 1999 to relive the moment.
We are 80% water ❤
Schlatt trying not to post a video saying he hates YouTube despite how much money he makes
dude finally, i gen enjoy you being you
I had to learn about 9/11 in school today…
This video makes it harder for me to accept that he's gone...RIP big guy 🙏🏻
Celsius is for people who don’t drink normal water
LETS FUCKING GO. FUCK REACTION CONTENT. SHIT WAS SO FUCKING BORING
1:01 thank fuck. Those videos aren't entertaining compared with his old stuff
Rip salt
Lmao what you tryed to describe as liberal you literally described conservative.
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NO MORE TIKTOK SLOP LETSGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
F=good c=A Flaming Pile of Incestual British and Irish Broken Dreams While Hitler Skull Fucks it
Reacting to REAL shit that viewers send in, like the pc setups and rooms, I think is pretty decent content. But the tik toks... Yeah, you said everything that needs to be said about the tik toks.
yo mama
Nice
Glad schlatt isn’t confessing what he done in 1999! I know what he did, I was the crosswalk in jersey.
I loved the unhinnged tiktok reactions so funny. goodbye schlat! o7
Posted on the one year anniversary of the murder that he got away with. Very classy
LETS GO
the reason fahrenheit is better is because it is based off of how it feels to people
Finally no more slop
play eu4 nerd
Celsius is still better than kelvin
Giveaways are really popular...So give me away, please?
Based take on Celsius
As of right now, this video is 9 hours old and #11 on gaming trending. Wonder what those numbers mean.
I fucking died laughing at this
Glad "Schlatt" is back from his exile to Antarctica.
Sometimes I feel like I can still hear his voice. RIP Big Guy
Wow, it's amazing how many videos "schlatt" had in store before he passed. He even was able to predict when the new city skylines comes out. R.I.P big guy. you will be missed. It's like I can still hear his voice.
it’s just entertaining seeing creators actually enjoy whatever they’re doing, i have no interest in specific clicky clacky matcha keyboards but if big guy did genuine reviews of them i would enjoy the content
1:03 YEAHHHHH WHOOOOO YESSS
I love seeing how absolutely chaotic the city is, and knowing for a fact that after he ended stream he 100% spent hours designing and building a really nice city and having a good time. Honestly though, I'm so fucking excited for this game. CS is my all-time favorite game, and getting a sequel is just amazing. I don't often let myself get hyped about games because of the currently state of the industry, but Colossal Order has been so open about the features of the game, and it's so clear just how passionate the devs are and how much they love the game, I just can't help but get hyped. Can't wait to spend hours optimizing my traffic and transit and micromanaging every aspect of the city
THANKS GOD FINALLY NO MORE TIKTOK GARBAGE SLOP!!!
DING DONG THE WITCH IS DEAD
Where is the funny moments where we laugh at gyatts and rizz?
Fucking finally💀💀💀
So glad your back big guy hope you can move on and get past prison i know it will be hard but you got it buddy stay clean and legal and hey big guy how was it ya know the big house
Wait, so schlatt drills kids 11:18
ain’t know way he posted on the anniversary of the queens death 💀
Best intro of 2023
You should play Defcon. Nothing like a dose of extreme existential dread in the morning.
its so nice of isaac to post schlatts prerecordings. its almost like hes still here. gone but not forgotten🕊🕊🌹🌹
#11 on trending gaming 💀💀💀
Where the hell is my Gamer Supps jschlatt.
So glad you're here man, we love you!
Im proud of you jShlazghatitus!!❤❤
great video most transparent ever, just wish you said the video was about to become a stream highlight
The johnny cash segment was the best part of that stream
change for the better! go for it, big guy!
thank fuck no more reaction videos
This is the worst birthday gift ever
Play this game in fuCKING RUSSIAN AGAIN. I absolutely loved that video with bönk and still reference it to this day.
Wait for 6 months and see what happens
Water only boils at 100°C at sea level too
HE HAS RISEN
Tysm for stopping the tiktok vids I missed ur other content a lot!! Shame u died though
AI got so realistic smh
Men?
Honestly loved the funny tiktok reactions but I do hope Schlatt is happy with whatever content he makes.
schlatt's hologram?
I love how genuine AI "schaltt" is after the "real schaltt" isn't with us now RIP🙏
u dont like Celsius cuz u dont understand it, same reason why i dont like Fahrenheit i dont understand so i dodnt like it ez
Just think of Fahrenheit as a percentage of heat
Didn’t miss you schlat ,because we were in the same Prison cell
LLJS🕊
okay.
jschlatt season 4
great to have you back bitch we missed you
At the very end of the video you can see a car driving towards the camera, stop for a second, then make a U-turn in the middle of the road and shoved his way in the line and I feel that guy just summed up the entire city's mood at the end
Things are about to change just like they did on that fateful day in ‘99
I understand literally nothing about Fahrenheit. How the fuck is 32 degrees the freezing temperature for water?
Hey jschnapps. Hope rehab went ok. Glad ur back
More Jack box
Me typing an essay about Celsius, only to realise Schlatt might already be back in prison :(
It’s very strange that he decided to release this video with a section about him “not being able to leave the country for some stupid reason” on the anniversary of the Queen’s murder.
I was so focused on the cats in the corner
Uploaded 3 days before the day we will never forget 🤔
Bro is spitting facts. Reacting videos are about the dumbest thing creators or tik Tokers can do unless it’s done right (cowchop) but it’s okay to do every now and then with friends depending on how much work they’re putting into it.
It’s like he’s still here…🥹 fly high big man 🕊️
I’m glad to hear that schlatt is moving away from reaction content, while I still watched the reaction videos, I always enjoyed his other content a lot more
Celsius or Farenheight doesn't really matter with feeling since feeling also includes humidity (btw warmer air holds more water). Everyone other than 3 countries in the world grew up on Celsius so when someone says it's 15C outside we all understand, while if you told us it was 59F we wouldn't have a clue (I literally had to google the conversion to make this point).  Other than that, welcome back
“Series” is a loose term
Isnt this the guy who killed Queen Elisabeth
Tbh I don't care what measurement system you use. As a Canadian I have to know ALL of them
I have just experienced an American try to justify using Fahrenheit...
Remember bonk
For science (particularly chemistry), I think Celsius is better. But when it comes to *literally everything else* Fahrenheit is so much better.
just goes to show that schlatt can't clean them pipes
0:15 I’m getting deja vu from this for some reason
Damn these A.I videos are getting really good. Fly high 🦆
In all seriousness, it’s super exciting to see Schlatt do something he enjoys. It’s clear he has the creativity to make amazing things, can’t wait to see what’s in store.
It feels right that on the 1-year anniversary of the Queens death, Schlatt uploads...
Gonna be honest man im soooooo happy you quite that litteral garbage content. I hate reaction videos and actually stopped watching you during this period because all youd upload is this no effort content that while yeah gets you alot of views and money also stopped the creative and fun content i subbed for. Its good to have you back big guy and im sure ill be sticking around now ❤
How the actual fuck does Fahrenheit "make more sense", how braindead is he lmfao
Yaaaay no more tiktok
Fahrenheit is a measurement on how a human feels. 50-70 is nice as hell. 80-100, you'll be a sweaty boy. 20-40, yeah, get a fuckin jacket on, whitewalker.   Celsius is how water feels. 0 for freezing, 100 for boiling. Makes sense, but not for human stuff. Just water.
Still hasn’t talked about that ai channel
TikTok made “Schlatt” depressed?    Who would’ve known?
How does farenheit make more sense ,,,
We did it america. "Ranking your ___ TikToks is no more."
I will fight you if you say fahrenheit is better again.
Seriously I’m happy that jshlatt is straying away from TikTok reacts
LETS GO BABY SCHLATT IS BACKKKKK
JSCHALAT PLAY HEARTS OF IRON IV!!!!! GOOD PARADOX INT. GEME.
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
big guy does this every year. two months of content then he gets burnt out
CAT!!!!!
Thank god you’re done with the reaction arc 🙏
Self awareness, self improvement. becoming the favorite again
Schlatt videos make me as gleeful as a little middle school girl
We be waiting here with a “welcome home from prison big guy!” sign
YOU WILL BOIL AT 100C
jschlatt kinda looks like sajam
0:00 - 0:05 AWW, LOOK AT HIS CATS GETTING ALONG :D
Cities skylines 1 looks better but there probably still working in the graphics
I’ll miss you Jschlangalang… or should I say Jonathan Wick… anyways rest easy Big Man.
LETS GO SKYLINES 2
I’ve been seeing things these past few days and now I’m seeing Schlatt like he never died. Missing you everyday big man, fly high 🕊️🕊️
he finally got his soul back
Missed ya schlung
Finally some good content
Feet
Wow AI is getting so advanced that they brang him back.. RIP big man he will always have the big title.
Rest in peace shlate 🕊️ it's like his still here 😭😭
Get this man in the presidential office
Glad schlatts back for the anniversary of death of our favorite British monarch
So are you gonna do that Schlatt Drip stream/video you never did? It was the first time I decided to create a video for the subreddit, and then you just never did it. It's been a year now
Am laugh lol
I hope jschlatt streams again after excatly 2 days for no reason 🙂
Fly High Schlatt 🕊🪦 This AI Is Getting So Realistic
Is alright schlatt, pat pat
Schlatt: I build a giant ballsack!  Later: I build a giant cock! Me both times: Damn mine looks different, time to see a doctor I guess 😂
RIP angel 🕊
Rest in Peace Schlutt 😔😔💔💔🥀
bro i am so glad you are finally out of prison and found your balance in life will miss u 🫳🫴🫳🫴🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡
Lo
The queen died a year ago❤❤🇮🇪
Jschopeniose the 3rd will always entertain me
YES OLD SCHLATT
we all know why scat wasnt allowed to leave the country
Let’s fuckiiiiing goooooooooo
Did you mean to post this on the 1-year anniversary of the Queen of England's death??? 😂
Yeah! Shlugglewuggle came back from prison l!
sad but it had to happen
1:00 YES YEEEESSS YEEESSS YES YEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS
I am a Celsius user, because I have no fucking idea what Fahrenheit means.
MORE OPENT TTD?!?!???!!!!?!???
thank fuck
Bruh why the fuck was I unsubscribed
dang i can still hear schlatt's voice sometimes.... it's almost like he's still here 💔🕊🪦
Make whatever the fuck you want ill watch it
Rest in peace Schlatt. You are missed
I'm glad you were able to go through the phase, get it outta your system, get that bag - but we missed the content you truly enjoyed to make big guy. Welcome back
I doooo like a good ranking
RIP, Schlatticus. He truly was a man of all time❤
super glad schlatt is back from eating my left shoe, pulling half of my head bald, and imprisoning my whole family in his home!
It feels like hes here fly high schat 🕊️🕊️🕊️
Honestly, I enjoyed the reactions when they were actually just "Schlatt"'s fans sending in the most cursed shit that they made specifically for him. And he's completely right about the stream part, even though I'm not usually on the streams, I like seeing "Schlatt"'s reaction to chat saying equally cursed shit, and seeing chat's reactions to the media before them as well. The TikToks kinda got stale fast, and they didn't have the same charm as actual content from the fans. I mean, I think that the presentations video was probably the best one in the series, and I'm happy that it's gonna go more or less back to that style of the reaction video.
still better designed then the real san Francisco
Fahrenheit is just a scale of 1-100 of how hot it is outside
welcome back from prison big guy. can't wait for viewer submissions to be back, not enough 9/11 jokes in the regular ol tiktoks.
I thought u died my Nigger w bro for getting revived
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SCHATLAT PLES MOR REAKTS...!!1
at this point i kind of don’t believe you man
Cant believe he’s announcing 9/12 early
i dont care chlat
god we need more ranking tierlist videos I fucking enjoyed that series to oblivion thank you "Mr. Blatt" 🙏
thank GOODNESS. i hated the reaction vids
Hey schlott, i love you
And not once did he rank those TikToks.
Avrage NY citizen asking where the smog is after you insult their air quality 5:11.
Whatever you do, I'll be there to support you man. You have helped me escape and even cured my depression for a very long time. I know this is ssappy and cringe, whatever content you pump out, I will be there to watch it. You'll always be the very cool uncle on YouTube that I would go and watch every time I get the chance to. Thank you for making great videos and making me a alot of people smile. :)
That's what I've been saying
This title reads as both a threat and a promise
Even I did like the TikTok compilations I'll always think the cc's happiness and mental health is more important, real glad you're coming back on streaming 'cause we're always going to be supporting you as you helped some of us to get out of rough times, love you Big Guy!
Why do you look like Tim from marble hornets
I can’t believe he passed so soon. Fly high big man. 🕊️🕊️🕊️
Thank fuckin god. Those react vids were funny the first handful of times, but jeez it seemed as though Schlatt was a husk by the end. Glad it's switching up.
LETS GO! So excited for some more content that isnt reaction content!
big W for you schlatt, do what makes you happy :3 good on ya for taking care of yourself man, your content is great, reaction or not
How the FUCK does Fahrenheit make much more sense? Bullshit.
hi
can things actually change this time please
Sounds good big guy 👍
I was worried you were losing the chops
Rip joke arent funny
You will never see this comment, but actually enjoying the content you make makes your videos so much better. Your TikTok reaction videos aren't bad, but the newer ones never got me laughing like the ones you enjoyed doing. IDK if I'm insane or not for thinking this but keep up the fun work!
cool
I’m glad that Schlatt’s crimes of 1999 have been excused. Can’t wait for the court cams.
it hurt me deeply to see you becoming a tiktok reaction channel.
It’s almost like he’s still here 💔😭… RIP big man 💀🕊️
You should do more of the text walking around videos, they're very funny
I will always remember bonk
Schlatt!!
Good luck man, Fly guy! It's so sad they took another one from us
the Jay Schlack fentanyl overdose arc boutta go crazy
2:27 note to the editor's note, there is a meaning behind the Fahrenheit scale actually, 0 is the freezing point of an equal part water and salt solution, and 96 was originally body temp (why 96? Idk so still kind of arbitrary I guess also it was measured more accurately later which is why body temp isn't still 96) a byproduct of this being that human livable temperatures are roughly 0 - 100, which is much more convenient for every day life, personally. 0 is quite cold, like you need to bundle cold, but it's fine really, and 100 is hot, still alright right, but you don't really want it to get any hotter, whereas in celsius 0 is pretty cold and 100 is actually death. Like if you are breaking forty you might as well be dead, that's over half the positive scale not being used. It's good for science and stuff, but not very useful, personally, for weather and stuff
you can't tell it's smog if that's all you ever see
Scheduled upload even after his death. What a devoted creator. Fly high big man
On the anniversary too bro 💀
I haven't been wondering, you've been slop farming. EZ money that ppl feed into
Holy shit he's gonna be uploading? Impossible.
god bless
I always found those vids so funny
YESSSS
❤❤❤
I love how incredibly honest Schlatt is with his audience and fully admits that the reaction videos were made purely for the money.
I can't believe a necromancer brought Schlatt back from the dead after the horrific drunk driving accident
im happy with ecerything you make  np mann
Bro i loved the reaction stuff why dont u do both
Fahrenheit and Celsius are both stupid. Kelvin Gang!!!
i really miss schlatt, i really wish he was still alive, so glad his friends came together to make ai schlatt real. Thank You.
A day doesn’t go by where I don’t look back at the time jschlatt attempted to push me into an oncoming New York subway. Rest in peace big fella fly high 🙏
Glad to see city skylines back
Super glad you let us know that way we don’t pester you. Quick question, mind explaining why my waifu cup is going to arrive on 9/11?
hes finally shaving 🙏
I miss him, Jambo wearing Jschlatt's rotting corpes to do sponsorships really make the process of grief easier.
People think I look like you ._. I got banned from a discord server bc of you jshlat for “impersonating someone else” ._.
Bro stops streaming every 9 months and comes back like ever nothing happened 😅
these Ai’s are getting out of hand, R.I.P Big man 🙏 🕊️ fly high.
Gonna miss you man. Rest in peace Jschlatt 💖
Farenheight is better for measuring temperature in relation to people, celcius is better for things like boiling point, and kelvin... is egotistical.
Rip Virginia Schlim, gone but not forgotten
jshalg
Fly high Spatt 🕊🕊🕊🙏🙏🙏
Jackbox please daddy
Why do they even give you the option for displaying the temperature in Kelvin? Who is that feature for?
I CANT belive they lowered Schlatts bail of $10,000 to $10 after he blinded a man in one eye in New Jersey and leaving that man in a shed for 3 hours! So happy he’s out of jail!
The submission videos/setup rating videos were instant classics. "It's not free, stop saying it's free. You can't have that"  🤣
finally
your nice temperature is 20 degrees, our nice temperature is 69 degrees, checkmate britain
glad to see you back big guy
No more reaction stuff?... that sucks, I loved all of those but I'm glad you're still gonna do some. I'm super happy about you coming back tho!! Missed you man cuz I love your vids
Hey Schlut I got the evidence you don’t have  I know every move you made from 1999 to 2001, bro  Your move
I'm older than you.
Why is shclatt's fandom like this? Who could have done such a thing
You should look up “cities by Diana” or better known as “lane man” and do some collab city skylines where you can learn to get really wacky with the builds
it says it releases October 24th, do you remember what the viewers predicted schlatt.
Are you finally gonna acknowledge that SMP Live happened, you were a part of it, and it was still, by far, the peak of your content?  Like seriosuly, half of the guys who played on it treat it like their time on the server was the equivalent of having fought on the wrong side in WWII. It was indisputably the peak of and reason for all of your fucking blowups, and you just act like it never fucking happened.
W take
I’m so glad big guy only got a year in prison for the murder of the queen. I’m so happy that he’s out.
Wow, cant wait to start watching you again, Massive step in the right direction, sad u didn't quit cause of how ur stealing views from creators but still wonderful news. please actually follow thru with it unlike moist critical.
Thank fucking god I saw the title and thought it meant his crimes in 99 finally caught up to him
lets go more ranking those videos made me laugh hard as hell
it's like I can still hear his voice😭
So sad that schlatt hasn’t been posting because he died. So glad to see him back!
Jschlatt putting in the controversial Celsius is worse than Fahrenheit comment right before shilling for skylines to get people to watch the whole thing while they're rage typing in his comments is clever
BOOOOH GET THIS GUY OUT OF HERE
The reaction era is over, I always thought it occurred because you were washed up.
jschlatt your tiktok reactions help me sleep everynight thank you. i have them on repeat all night so i hope thats giving you a good pay check 💀
As a San Franciscan, I hope "Jschlatt" doesn't return after what he did in 1989
RIP SCHLATT, we will miss you forever! Fly high big guy.
Thank you Mr.Shlatt                    Mr.shlert
can’t believe “schlort” was kind enough to prerecord these videos before he got sent to prison RIP legend 🙏
Schplatt is evolving into...something.  idk what , and that's  scary, but i look forward  to him emerging  as a beautiful  elegant butterfly in the end
The C stands for can’t land on the moon the F stands for F***ing landed on the moon
fly high "jschlatt"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I saw him on a shirt and had to come through, rest well big guy.
It really does feel like hes still here.. Rest in peace Big guy.
Did not ASK!
F > C because of accuracy. Saw mf in Spain were using decimals on their thermostats. Smh. Just say you want it 68F not 23.4C or whatever tf
Schlatt looks like an egg
I like the tiktok ones tho :(
Fun little fact, 0 Celsius is 32 Fahrenheit. So technically 0c + 0c is 64f
RIP Jonathon, thanks for all the laughs <3
Thank god I can finally subscribe to the channel again without having my recommended page flooded with low effort garbage.
Schlatt, may you rest in peace. Everyone here has felt your positive impact in their lives and we can only mourn that this was taken away from us too early. Live on…
he snapped, he finally snapped and took a page out of jerma's psycho book, he meatgrinded a viewer didn't he!?!?!
I can't believe Schlatt murdered JJJSchlatt and took back control of his channel. Greatest plot twist in all of media.
TREVOOOOR
AI is getting scary man, this almost feels like I'm watching the real shlong.
NO MORE TIKTOK REACTIONS LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
FINALLY!!!
I dont know how to measure
YEEES SCHLATT YOUR BACK!!!!
I think some dougdoug style audience interaction in a schlatt stream would be absolute perfect chaos
Exited to see your stuff! I’m glad you’re keeping your mental health in mind
i’m so glad your back from prison man wish you the best of luck 🙏
Maybe you could post some of the sleep deprived Minecraft content?
Hi
NOOOOOOOO 😭
As an engineering student you are 100% correct. Metric is better for just about everything but, Fahrenheit is the one thing that imperial has
RIP big man shat😢😢😢
Thank you Ludwig for creating a Jshlatt AI so his legacy can continue. Fly high Big Man🕊❤️🪦
I miss schlattr so much, I hope he ends his time in purgatory soon…thoughts and prayers to Jebadiah Hougin Schlattr 💕💕🙏
NBJ REFERNCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It’s crazy how realistic it is. These streams make us feel like he is still with us ❤️ 🕊️
So sad he's gone. At least he finally paid for what he did to those poor people in 1999 though
jschlutt play roblox
otk here, you are a criminal, dude, just admeeett ittttttttt
thank GOD i HATED the reaction vids
c' is for how hot it is for water, f' is for how hot it is for people, k' is for how hot elements feel, therefore F' is OBJECTIVELY the best degree to use
ah the annual 'things are about to change' video, see you in a year big guy!
Jscat why did you specifically choose this clip at 1:20? 🤨
schlatt really just pulled the exact same tactic he used in 2021 and got away with it
And with the end of the TikTok reactions, all is well in the world
Nice.
Repent and believe in the gospel 🙏✝️✝️
My thoughts are with his family god bless will always miss him😭🙏🕊🕊🕊💔
No more tiktoks. No more me. 😢
Thank goodness. You have enough subs to literally do whatever the fuck you want, bro. At least do something cool.
I loved binging that stream, Big Guy. Here's to hoping you can foster a community of people who love the same content that you like. I think you can pull it off!
Love how schlatt uploaded this on the 1 year anniversary of the queen's death. We know what you did
shatt is back lesgooo
As someone who uses the metric system Fahrenheit makes more sense than celcius
YURRRR
Man, im happy Schlatt got back from the dead, cool of him to visit the necromancer i recomended!!! Welcome back big guy!!!
So nice of Shalt to bulldoze the high school, a truly advanced and innovative approach to tackling the issue of school shootings.
Rip Schlatt 💔🕊️
gone but not forgotten for what he did in '99 🕊
Appreciate the transparency with the TikTok vids, most channels would not bluntly admit that
100k in 6hours is wild
Can't believe this was sponsored
I'm glad you're bringing back the viewer made reaction stuff those were always great
Balls.
don't worry big guy, will literally watch and support anything u make, you're hilarious and super epic!! love your dayz plays, cities skylines, streams with other ytbers, seeing you in all the podcasts, and literally everything. stay cool, make that dough, and pet the gatitos for us😎👍❤️ also RIP you'll be missed
Are you going to stop fake reacting to memes?????
Kelvin > all other temp. measurements
so glad to see shaft out of prison 🙏
They didn’t let Schlatt go to Germany because he would’ve caused the second worst atrocity in its history
Ever since my sister introduced me to Jshart, he's been a massive inspiration to me. Since childhood I've always wanted to commit mass homicide with a sword in a public place just like Jshart did back in '99. But don't tell anybody that. Every now and then I'll go back to his old tier list videos like the Minecraft parodies/builds and the cereal/chips/etc. tier lists. Watching this it almost feels like he's still here with us. Fly high big guy, you will be missed. 🕊
Hes pregnant
Respectful. Please give me the real content, can’t wait.
his first stream back and he immediately starts shilling the illiterate redneck temperature system that nowhere else on earth has used for decades, god bless this big guy
about dang time give me another vid about the stupid big head people
this really harkens back to the classic cities skylines vids you did back in 2019 through to march 2020. my only complaint is that the hyper-fast no-room-to-breathe zoomer editing kills the vibe; if you compare this against your last skylines video, the difference is really obvious. i guess it's fine because the full stream is readily available, but it's still a shame. the way every last pause is cut out gives no opportunity for a sense of flow or comedic timing
So sad that “Shlatt” gave into AI so we can see regular content again, there is no way big man the reactor to TikTok’s would play a game
Can you also change how you do vods on twitch sometimes i cant catch them or if you have a schedule aomewhere that would be nice i would kove to watch you play city skylines
Rip, he was the hero we didn't deserve, nor the hero we needed, nor the hero we wanted, but the hero we had, fly high Big Man 🕊️🕊️🕊️
4:02 Shoot did not expect NJB here but pleasantly surprised! Love that channel.
R.I.P big man, fly high jschlott
holy shit yes
Let's fuckin go!!!
not just bikes reference lets goooo
It's like i can still hear him ranking tiktoks... rest in peace, big guy 🕊🕊🕊
build the pentagon, then destroy it.  life will be good
Ayo it's Trevor! Trevy boi good ol t-man the trevmiester fuckin uh yeah TREVORRRRR that's my fuckin dude right there gets me going fr like crack
I’ve been saying the temperature thing for years. fahrenheit is the MUCH better system. In Fahrenheit 0 to 100 are basically the livable range, too far passed either and being out doors for two long is dangerous. That scale in Celsius is like -20 to 40, dumb. The water argument is also stupid because A, it’s only accurate at an exact pressure and purity and B, that isn’t how people even boil water. You just put the water on a heat source until it starts to boil
He went from explanation video to city skylines
fucking finally
this is gonna be a massive move in the right direction
im sorry for the inconvenience of me NOT GIVING A FUCK
Schleeb, this day will go down in history (nothing compared to ‘99).
3:56 why did i read this in tuckers voice
youtuber streamers make these videos like 3 to 4 times a year
Alternate Title: Schlatt turns San Francisco into Detroit
Address time to smile. 🙂
Jawsh was almost right on when Schlatt would return. He said 9/11 but ngl it makes more sense that he’d return on the Queens death date.
thank fuck
no more Jslop 😔
WHY ARE YOU ALL SAYING HE IS DEAD WHAT IS GOING ON
RIP bro 😔
Yall last time we heard these words he was president of manburg, I'm scared lmao
Its good to see that Shart had a video ready for after his death. RIP Big Guy
NO MORE REACTIONS LETS GOOOOOO
Imma be real honest, I'm American, and in engineering school, and I prefer using Celsius
Fuckin finally schlart
who knew you could use hashtags as just tags for your tweet?
We love you ❤❤❤❤.  Please don’t worry about us we’ll be okay.  Just do what you need to to better your life.
As a new jsclat(?whatever) fan I am confused as to what channels here on YouTube are actually legit and what content is being posted and where    Literally the only thing I saw that was categorized let's say were the Jackbox videos and the YouTube shorts (a.k.a the reason I started watching anyways like a month ago)
bro uploads on the death of the queen anniversary
Celsius is a lot easier to read and systematic while Fahrenheit uses some random AI number generator shit 212F°? 96F°?
Please jschlatt never say "milked to completion" again
rip schlatt, but thank god he’s done doing reaction videos😭
mr. schlatt i love the hair
Water freezes at zero. It just makes sense. IDGAF. Fight me🇨🇦
Well, it’s been a year from the hit, who’s next slankus?
The TikToks were boring and unoriginal and I know you knew that. I really like that you’re moving more towards your kinda thing.
Fly high Scoliosis ❤️🕊️ we’re going to miss you
Cities skylines 2 come out on my birthday :D
L take on Celsius vs Fahrenheit.                     ...The aforementioned essay on 'How Our Dumb System of Measurement Is Better Than Yours.'  -Schlagg  As a Canadian Engineering student, I have to use both Imperial and Metric units of measurement. Grams, Pounds, Tonnes, Tons Liters, Ounces, Gallons, PSI, Bar, Pascal, Kip... the list is almost endless. There is not a single Imperial unit that I prefer over their Metric equivalents, especially for calculations. Canadians use both Metric and Imperial units in our daily lives, sometimes even interchangeably.   I can say with full confidence that Celsius is superior to Fahrenheit. Not only is 100C the boiling point for water, but 0C is the freezing point. On top of that, Celsius is directly proportional to Kelvin (the unit of temperature favored for calculation in physics, 0K being the absolute absence of heat), 300K in Celsius (26.85C) is calculated by subtracting 273.15  (because they are directly proportional, this is the case for any temperature), while 300K in Fahrenheit would be calculated as such: (300K − 273.15) × 9/5 + 32 = 80.33F. There is no reason anyone should prefer Fahrenheit to Celsius outside of the fact that they are already accustomed to it.   Oh, and glad to see things are changing for the better. Looking forward to future content!
Are you sure its not because over the anniversary of your kill?
first thing that needs to change is the beard cut
BRING ME THE CUUUUUUUUUBEEEEEE
fly high big guy 🫶🏽
🍠
Today is the 1 anniversary of what “Schlatt” did in London.
The return of волк
I swear to god, I went to the comments and my heart DROPPED.... until I watched the video. 💀💀
I’ll be behind Shatt thick and thin, do what you want dad!!
I'm so devastated by the loss of our good friend Jschlatt. RIP 🙏
Nice to have you back for real this time Schlatt!
Fly high king Schlatt 🕊️. We will miss you 🙏🏼.  I can still hear is annoying ass voice😭🕊️.
RANKINGS AGAIN LES GO
So sorry to lose a legend,,rest in piece Johnathan🕊🕊
The Big Guy says: Bazinga
Seriously thank fucking god i mean they were funny but jesus christ
honestly i only enjoyed watched those reaction videos cuz of your personality specifically, i'll enjoy anything you make
Rest in peace shlatt, fly high
Kelvin gang, makes sense. 0 is 0. Then the metric system is noice
HE'S BACK!!!!!!
Is it bad that I will Miss it :(
good content
Low-key I'm glad that things are returning to how they used to be, but tbh I'll watch whatever Schlatt posts because he's the one who makes it funny
Come on schlatt be glade your not in prison.
Shlatt I believe u weren’t supposed to get out for like another like…. Couple months….. so what happens? WHAT HAPPENED SHLATT?!?!
10:00 Solaire
1999 still holding up good huh
Hey Schlatt, I noticed 9/11 remembrance day is on monday and i know your a new yorker so on monday i'll think of you ❤❤❤✈🏢🏢
Bruh how is Fahrenheit better. It has a stoopid long and complex name and Celsius works where 0 is the barrier into freezing point. It makes so much more sense knowing that any Celsius vale that is negative is freezing
Slurp, we will all miss you. 🕊️
LETS GOOO!!!! I love your gaming content and am so glad to hear the tiktok reaction vids are going to be taking a backseat. Can't wait to see what videos you make! :)
So glad to hear the tiktok reactions are ending. Those got old after the first one
the great rotunda comes back
Aw, I actually liked the reaction videos mostly when the video banded together to troll you
THANK YOU I WOULD HAVE BLOWN MY BRAINS OUT IF ONE MORE  TIKTOK REACTION VIDEO CAME OUT!! (also happy you could make it out of jail)
This version of San Francisco is actually better than the real life San Francisco. Probably safer too.
Yooo big guy is out of prison! I’m proud big guy
Interesting how “Schlatt” has ended his Tik tok reaction series without addressing the “time to smile” allegations 🤔
I love how “Schlatt’s” comment section never provides information even remotely related to the video. That being said. RIP Sclut
wtf is a kilometer?
The plan is simple.
omg actual content im so excited
Where me openttd vids at schlat
It almost feels like Jshat is still here with us, he will be missed    Rest well big guy🕊🕊
Jschlatt gave me a lot of fun times over the years, and I'm still struggling to process that it's over.  Jacob S. Chlatt will be missed and remembered as one of the greats.  Fly high brother
watching these old prerecords uploaded now feels so weird, fly high man... you wont be forgotten, RIP
no your one hundred percent right Fahrenheit all the way baby
Keep schlatt smiling
Schlatt streams are huge
1:58 They hated Jesus because He told them the truth
YESSSSS
im glad he decided to do this
YES I HATE THESE STUPID FUCKING TIKTOK VIDEOS
Kinda creepy how this is all AI, Fly high big guy 🕊
Rest in peace big man 🩷 we’ll never forget you
it's almost like he's still with us 💔💔
Are you gonna play open TTD again? Jschlatt TTD? Open TTD? Jshlatt?
🥹
R.I.P schlatt…so sad you died in prison. Your crimes caught up..
Schlatt is going to start his own game show based on what happend in 1999?
god. its so unbelievable, i cant believe it. rip schlamt. 💔
Fly high schatt we'll miss you man🕊
september? schlatt? please?
thank fuck
this was literally only uploaded for views i wont believe what he says in this video at all
this was literally only uploaded for views i wont believe what he says in this video at all
Schatt this is your true calling 🎉  More of this please kind sir ☺
It almost feels like Schlitoris is still here with us, fly high big guy🙏🕊️
I'm actually really glad that he's making content he enjoys again. Good job "Schlatt"  And so glad you came back refreshed from prison. What an enlightening experience
Title: Advantages of the Fahrenheit Temperature Scale  Introduction  The debate between the Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature scales has persisted for decades, with proponents on both sides presenting compelling arguments. While Celsius is the predominant choice for scientific and international purposes, the Fahrenheit scale possesses unique advantages in certain contexts. This report aims to highlight the specific advantages of the Fahrenheit scale over the Celsius scale in terms of precision, human-centric representation, and practical applications.  Precision in Everyday Temperatures One of the primary advantages of the Fahrenheit scale is its precision when measuring everyday temperatures, especially in regions that experience a wide range of temperature fluctuations. Fahrenheit employs smaller degree increments compared to Celsius, allowing for a finer level of detail in temperature reporting. This precision becomes particularly valuable when assessing weather forecasts, as it enables individuals to make more informed decisions based on temperature variations.  For instance, in regions with variable climates like the United States, Fahrenheit provides a more nuanced understanding of temperature changes, making it easier for the public to prepare for and adapt to daily weather fluctuations. This granularity can be crucial for planning outdoor activities, determining appropriate clothing choices, and responding to temperature-sensitive situations.  Alignment with Human Comfort Zone Fahrenheit's alignment with the human comfort zone is another notable advantage. Originally designed with the human body in mind, the Fahrenheit scale sets 0°F as the approximate lowest natural temperature and 100°F as the average human body temperature. This intuitive alignment with temperatures humans commonly experience makes Fahrenheit a more relatable and practical scale for assessing comfort and discomfort in weather conditions.  When discussing weather or climate, Fahrenheit offers a more relevant perspective for individuals, as it relates directly to their comfort and well-being. For example, reporting a temperature of 90°F in Fahrenheit immediately informs people about a hot and potentially uncomfortable day, whereas the equivalent temperature in Celsius (32°C) may not convey the same level of relatability or impact.  Enhanced Weather Reporting Fahrenheit's suitability for weather reporting is evident in regions where temperatures can range from frigid winters to scorching summers. The Fahrenheit scale's broader range accommodates these temperature extremes more effectively than Celsius. This makes it a better choice for conveying the full spectrum of temperature variations, especially in regions with diverse climates.  For instance, when reporting temperatures in Fahrenheit, residents in such regions can better anticipate the effects of temperature changes on their daily lives throughout the year. This is particularly important for preparing for and responding to extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, cold snaps, or temperature fluctuations that impact agriculture and infrastructure.  Conclusion  In conclusion, the Fahrenheit temperature scale offers distinct advantages in terms of precision for everyday temperatures, alignment with the human comfort zone, and enhanced weather reporting. While Celsius remains the global standard for scientific and international applications, Fahrenheit's practical benefits cannot be overlooked, especially in regions where it is deeply ingrained in daily life and culture. The choice between Fahrenheit and Celsius should be made based on the specific application and the region's unique needs. Fahrenheit's continued use in certain contexts is justified by its ability to effectively convey temperature information to the public, enabling individuals to make informed decisions and adapt to changing weather conditions.
he broke out of prison, hes on the run from the cops, do not listen to the lies, he is incredibly dangerous
Thas crazy
“Schlatt” must have enjoyed his prison stay
He’s Gayschlatt confirmed
looks like a great spot for a Walmart
God i am so glad you are done with this reaction bullshit, I love variety content and I want you to keep that up
Damn, Schlatt would've definitely posted a video like this. AI is getting so advanced these day. If only he were still with us 😭 Fly high big man 🕊️🕊️🕊️
i genuinely enjoyed the shit schlatt viewers sent in the most, so i'm definitely on board with this.
They found what happened in 99 right, schlatt
So bad you beat the charges big man
Fuuuuuuuck yes
Yeah, go make a bubble gum tier list bitch (pls)
Genuinely glad the reaction videos are over, whatever content makes you happy makes us happy!
schlatt was not literally in prison, but he was in a figurative prison of making shitty tiktok reaction videos
Bring the reactions back.
Love to hear that you're taking time to enjoy the videos you're making. I can absolutely numb my brain watching you react to shit but I miss the gameplay videos like I miss my kids... They'll never find them... I don't want to remember... Love you big man
Hell yeah bro
Dude I was not expecting that Not Just Bikes tweet clip. looool
We need more Jackbox
my slop ❤
I love how ai makes it like he’s still with us! Fly high king 🕊️🕊️
Return of the king
Fahrenheit is based, Kelvin is for nerds and Celsius is for pussies.
the comments💀
As a 36 year old who hates Tiktok, I'm very happy
Happy to see different content, you have way more to offer than just sitting and watching TikTok. In the last year, only 3 videos were not reacting videos. As much as i enjoy the jschlatt humor just watching someone re-watch clips just seems so dystopian just like it the video could have been an ai voice and a png in the corner and it would have been the same.
Yes thank god no more tiktok shit. Notifications back on boys
No
glad your back gayshit ❤️
WOO THANK THE LORD
From what i know Fahrenheit seems better for day to day stuff, but I have no idea how it works since I didn't grow up with it.
About time
Thank you.
Bro the reactions were a W though
gross. bring back reaction content you delinquent, stay depressed and make me happy.
YEAAAAAAAA BRING BACK BONK AND MEEBEEB
ok ok I'll order it. On Steam. Cut taxes to zero or negative just like god and Aaron burr want. have to finish Starfield first
i really missed "schlatt", i didnt think he would get back from prison so soon.
Hey big guy on a serious note do what makes you happy man! Your true fans will always be here for you :)
7:23 good reference
YES YES YES!!! YEE!!!!!!
Schlatt, you are the first YouTuber that comes to mind when I think about the word "authentic". And by Authentic, I mean you take your job as a YouTuber seriously, you care about what you upload, and how you feel about it while you're doing it. It's easy (and fun) to ham up the acting for views sometimes, it's such good fucking content- but you never act like someone you're not for views and I have such an immense amount of respect for that on such a volatile platform. You're a real gem, Big Man~ It's easy to see you enjoy what you do. I wish I could support you without throwing money at you. also: Your silent Japan vlog was an absolute delight to watch, and I'm super excited for more content of this type!
return to minecraft
Reaction videos are fine as long as it's viewer-generated content. Otherwise you're just freebooting.
Stop being rich
1:03 its over kindergartener bros, we lost
I am so happy the tiktok reactions are over, they honestly got old very quickly. Happy to have you back big guy, hope you get to do what makes you happy ❤
RIP shat.
He has to change up every now and then so he doesn't go insane like how he did in 99
fahrenheit is awesome man, celsius only has 0 37 and 100, which yeah i guess it's for ice for drivers or whatever but you just take one glance and look whether it's under 32 or not lmao ice isn't gonna magically spawn the SECOND it goes below 32. plus where's the drama when it does go into the negatives man. it's stupid. plus even though 37 is better than 98.6, 37.8 is WAY worse than 100.4 bffr. and then who fucking cares when it's boiling i'm not staring at the pot when i want tea lmao
tiktok react videos are okay ig but im glad more content is on the way
Rip fly high big man 🕊️😔
Dad! You're back from getting milk!
RANKING W
I miss him already
Hope he finds the password the the main channel soon 🙏
Finally... we put the LIVE back in the jschlatt
replicated exactly what is going on in san fransisco
Fly high sky king 🕊️🕊️🕊️
Candy review🔥
Happy for you, big guy.
Fitting he decides to post a video today. I believe it’s a distraction from what he did 1 year ago. Beware, I’m onto you Schlatt.
"Why do the best people die first?" "When you pick flowers, which ones do you pick?" "The prettiest ones!" RIP "Jschlatt" hope you find peace in heaven
Okay cool, but that doesn't explain the death of 15 Asian teenagers back in 1999 Schlatt
Rest in peace schlut 💔😭 miss you big guy!!!
Rip jschlatt forgotten but not gone
thx bro i legit had to take a hiatus after that tiktok shit brotha
Schlatt posts a video close to the date 9/11, titled "Things are about to change.", promotes "Cities : SKYLINES 2". I see. I see.
Shlat daddy goin through changes. Proud of big mane
I haven't watched this but oh god what's going to happen
I'm glad to hear the charges were dropped
I still can’t believe he pre recorded all of these videos so he could entertain us even in death Rise high Big Guy. ❤❤❤🕊️🕊️🕊️
So glad my JSchligga is still here
WHERE DO YOU STREAM!!!!
the schlatt shaker
I stopped watching a while ago because you didn't seem happy with what you were making.  Even with every tik tok video you posted, your smile in the thumbnail got smaller every time.  I hope you have fun with what youre making!  Good luck "shat"!
Love that the viewer submissions from the Reddit is still around, those videos were always more fun to watch tbh anyways
Celsius, also known as the Celsius scale, is undeniably superior to Fahrenheit in several aspects. Firstly, Celsius offers a more logical and intuitive reference system. In this scale, the freezing point of water is set at 0 degrees Celsius (°C), while its boiling point is 100°C at standard atmospheric pressure. This straightforward and evenly spaced scale allows for easy comprehension and estimation of temperature changes.  On the other hand, Fahrenheit lacks a cohesive reference system. In the Fahrenheit scale, water freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) and boils at 212°F. The irregular intervals between these two reference points make it more challenging to gauge temperature differentials accurately. This inconsistency can lead to confusion and difficulties in understanding temperature readings.  Furthermore, Celsius has gained widespread global adoption, making it the preferred temperature scale in most countries and scientific disciplines. The International System of Units (SI) officially recognizes Celsius as the standard unit for temperature measurement. This universal acceptance facilitates communication and avoids confusion when sharing temperature data across borders and scientific communities.  Moreover, Celsius is particularly advantageous for scientific calculations. It aligns well with the Kelvin scale, another widely used temperature scale in scientific research. The Kelvin scale is based on absolute zero, the point at which all molecular motion ceases. The Kelvin and Celsius scales share the same unit size, with a difference of only 273.15 degrees. This direct relationship simplifies conversions between the two scales, eliminating the need for complex calculations.  In conclusion, Celsius outshines Fahrenheit in terms of simplicity, logical reference points, global adoption, and scientific compatibility. Its straightforward scale and widespread use make Celsius the superior choice for temperature measurement. Whether in daily life, international cooperation, or scientific endeavors, Celsius stands as a reliable and efficient temperature scale.
k lil bro
No offense to schlatt I love the content been watching since a tribute to Minecraft but he comes out with an announcement like this every year and then never follows through I’ll still watch everything though I love everything he drops
I need big guy in my mouth I missed you. R.I.P
While celcius makes more sense with 0 degress freezing and 100 being boiling.... Schlatt's right. 100+ fahrenheit makes total sense for "It's fucking hot outside" and 5 degree difference shouldn't be what tells me I need a sweater vs sweating in a t-shirt.
The toilet placement for that edit was perfect, ppl always lean forward anyways
lets fucking go
Its HAPPENING!!
holy shit jschlatt uploaded on the anniversary of the queen's death
I loved your Radiohead series so much:)))) plz finish on a platform that doesn't have a scuffed copyright system💕
W but i  m not watching this vid cz i saw the whole stream
Thank God
:/
I like none, I use the Hot and Cold Scale. Like damn if i touch water and it hurts. thats hot. its easy!
From a European standpoint: I learned to love Farenheit for weather. It's just that I can't ever use it cuz people don't understand it here.
Can’t believe the Kings guard finally got him RIP
i’m so confused-
Why is it that every time you post you’ve moved your PC
dman man, i really only liked him for his tik tok reactions
💋
This video is probably what they used as a reference when mapping out LA.
ahh genuine content, its about damn time big boy. its felt like i havent seen the real you on camera since the mail reading videos
Just start heroin if you're so eager to chase the dragon
Fly high man 🕊️🕊️ RIP Schlumbus
This is genuinely what I've been hoping for. Genuinely thank you so much for abandoning the tik tok reactions
love you 😘
Ai is getting way to realistic
celsius is dumb, but its what im used to so meh
Fucking finally. I hope I can start watch again
Even after jschlatt killed supermega in a double murder suicide, his spirit shines on <33 AiSchlatt for president 2024
Letttttttttsssssssss gggggggoooooooooooooooo
Thank fuckibg god I usually watch vids multiple times but last 5 videos have been a pain to watch once
Jschlatt fans when he finally posts content again
It’s always the good ones that die young. Rip Shlutt 😔❤
poiling
That was his final solution 💀
I wish he could have lived to see the amazing response everyone has had to this, his final video. Fly high Schlatt 🕊️🫡
Nooooo I liked them
Huzzah thanks for being true to yourself and others.
I think it would be funny if we referred to this new era of schlatt as the schlungus era. This funny.
I’m so sad that jebedahia schlatt will no longer watch tic toks, like a normal human being
Rest in peace, “Jason Sclatterson”
Unironically thrilled that you are doing what makes you happy again, it's been very appearant that you haven't been interested in your content just by how you act on chuckle sandwich and all that. I'm excited to see what's new with the big guy!
i'll miss schlatt
true good move,  make an update video thats also a cool gaming video as well, Schlatt move, make a sponsored update video and not even show up to the event that sponsored you.  (Joke btw, love you guys)
YAY NEW CREATIVE SCHLATT CONTENT YAY WOOOOOOO LET'S GOOOO
He was my favorite gay person, so sad he died... rest in piece schlatt watty
Reaction vids aren’t the only thing he has milked to completion.
dude about time i stopped watching when you just started farming money im glad to have some good entertainment back
people r like ~75% water tho
about the temperatures, honestly ferenheit is good for MOST things, but i find celcius better for other things like CPU and GPU (etc) temps as it makes more sense seeing your gpu at 60c rather than like 140f which looks FUCKING INSANE. but for the most part i agree.
Thanks jambo ❤❤ rip schlatt🫶 gone but never forgotten😢
THE BIG GUY IS BACK LETSGO
Heartbreaking to hear that the Big Guy isn’t among us anymore. It will be safer out here tho, just think about what he did back in 99. RIP Schlonk, we miss you 💔
Thanks for the upload. Sincerely. Keep doing what keeps you happier.
Both the measurement systems are ass we should just make a new one
I need to say this. Fahrenheit only makes more sense to you because it's what you're used to.
In all seriousness, while the Tik-Tok reactions were kind of fun for a while, they were starting to get a little stale. And I missed when Schlatt actually ranked things, like cereals, chips and cookies, instead of lying to me in every thumbnail for a year straight.
The Fahrenheit take is so based like why tf would you want bigger increments for measuring temperature
Ohh my god he finally uploaded
fuuuuuuuck yeah i hated those tiktok videos. i watch your content because i enjoy the way your humanity seeps through the cracks of this awesome character you play. we can tell when youre unhappy.
W content
I am really happy to see you do another vid like this!
its about damn time
fahrenheit is bad, celsius is bad, kelvin is the ultimate temperature measurement system
if you were to ask a human 50,000 years ago with no concept of heat measurement in imperial or metric, they would respond with something close to Fahrenheit. if you ask water how hot it is, it would answer with celsius.
hell yes. at long last.
LET'S GOOO.
im playing video games someone give me a tldr
Wait, Shlog died?
I cant believe that he got the death sentence
i love how he called me out 0:15
yoooo
im so fucking happy the reaction videos are over, i never liked or watched them 😅 and ive kept quiet bout it till now lmao- rip to the ppl who enjoyed them but good riddance
you can tell there are jynxi fans in the comments
City Skylines is kinda gay tho, big man
Glad to have you back, you walking 9/11 Joke
rip schlatt he will be missed.
FIANLLY CONTENT!
I want more company logo videos
Woah he on a first name basis with mr. krabs
Sure it ain't from 9/11 being 3 days away
Happy birthday, “Schlatt?”!
Norm being mentioned on a jschlatt video is something I wouldn’t expect.
WARRRR ISSS OVVEEERRRRR
OH SHIT
BONK
This editing is too fast-paced
Pulling 10 mil on a reaction is not easy.
WOOOOOOOOO HE DOESN'T NEED MONEY ANYMORE
here's my dumb essay: water boils at 100 and freezes at 0. enough said.
Yeah baby that’s what I’ve been waiting for
I liked those stupid tiktoks Go back to jail
WWWWWWWWWWWW
The Metric system is just better dip ship
it's almost like he never went to prison
Welcome back “Schlatt”!
FINALLY
3:12 questionable hand position in the air and then talked about Germany afterward
Fly high buddy you will be missed 🕊️🕊️🕊️❤
I am comfortable driving at the speed of light I do not care how many die I will drive at the speed of light on a public road
we missed you big guy
BOI I WANT TO PLAY CS2 SO GAYT DAYUM BADDDDD
Gaming schlatt is back! I have not heard good news like this since the 8th of September 2022!
Ranking ???!!
glad to see schlatts final goodbye, rest in peace
I’m going to miss schlatt, I can’t believe that he’s going to prison! He should fire that lawyer…
Ok.
Keep up the good work big guy.
He somehow made an accurate San Fran while completely trolling.
No joke here, I'm actually really happy about this! Hopefully we'll see some more Wii games!🙂
schlatt is right. fahrenheit is for measuring how hot a human feels, celsius is for how hot water feels, and kelvin is for how hot molecules feel
we did it joe
Good
I have bombs planted throughout the entirety of New York, do not stop with your reaction videos.
huge respect
One year anniversary of Schlatts crimes against the UK
welcome back my guy
THANK GOD HE'S GONE
mm chemistry units, thats the only reason i use them
I get using Celsius for science stuffs, but not for weather. 100⁰ is really hot out, 0⁰ is really cold out
im so glad 'schlatt' is still alive 🙏
rip scat... so sad tbh.. 🕊
Rest In Peace slacth. Deserved
NIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
genuinely hated the reaction shit so much glad its fuckin over lmao
Are they though, like are they really
We love Paradox Interactive and we love fan submission reactions. Nothing but W's
Cant belive he got released from prison for what he did in 1999
Bro managed to get over the slop content
Bro was just going crazy that's what this is about
awe man, looks like schlatt's going back to prison
Nah ppl get used to a unit from where their education take place, the Metric and Imperial System is based off peoples recommendation, but almost all nations worldwide excluding USA uses the Metric system,
Finally I can watch you again ! 😮😮😮😮
I can’t believe I’m back to see my murderer is uploading again
Bro, u always saying this. I don’t believe it anymore lol
Un-schlerking here for a second, I’ll watch anything schlatt makes cause it’s always good
Hyped to see the channel’s heading in a better direction! Your corporate logos rant is honestly my favorite video of yours and it would be awesome to see more.😊
Hi daddy I missed up papa.
hi
Fly high schlatt , high enough to not hit the towers
I miss him already. Exactly 1 year after the queen too.
Didn’t watch but no they’re not
nice cat
it's almost like I can still hear him.. RIP, thank you jambo for posting this for him
The point makes everything more dramatic
2:32 you cut the clip early i know your secret
Genuinely very happy to hear this.
Why are people saying rip? could someone explain? Edit: ok I think I get it now ;)
i’m actually very glad you’re stopping the tiktok reacts 🥹🫶 i love your other content
Bloody hell, you had to talk about celcius Bro mesure shit with football field and think he can give his opinion lmao
Ok cool ig
you and I had differences since 99, but I'm glad you're choosing to be both affluent and happy
I enjoyed the react videos
Can we have more drunk driving
Glad to see your back
No way Schlatt thought so much about us that he recorded all of this for Jambo to upload it. Fly High Schlatt 🕊
I hope you stream on 9/11 Laugh about the towers. Make a diorama out of cake using a fork for the plane and two small slices of cake. Knock the cake over. 9/11 simulator IRL.
Happy he stopped the fake laughing series
I already miss him. Rest in peace Schlatt. We will all miss you! ❤️
Hell yea big man u do what u need to do to make urself better
Rest in peace Schlatt
Tqm Jschlat
i wish he was still with us... RIP big man...
Brutally honest as always.   You will be missed Johnathan Schlatt.
Fahrenheit does not make more sense. Do you want 32F freezing and 212F boiling or 0C freezing and 100C boiling -_-
The queen died 1 year ago today
I mean realistically in san Francisco a fucking trashcan is $1.6 billion
Thanks for coming back and depriving citizens of their basic living necessities for 9 minutes
YES MORE CITIES SKYLINES THAT WAS MY FAVORITE SERIES
I miss him so much... RIP schart....
Fahrenheit is based on how the body feels Celsius is how water feels It makes more sense 2:22
Thank god
Schlatt: I'm back  *Posts city skylines for two weeks*  Schlagg: goodbye
THANK JESUS. I hated those videos. They're so not you
im sorry how is 32 degrees 0 degrees
THANK GOD THIS MILKING SHIT IS OVER.
You’ve been posting on sleep deprived though so I’m good
Fly high big guy
balls
Still waiting for bonk and meebeeb to come back
YAY!
"Schlatt" Should butcher some more jackbox games
fucking loved the video essays and the japan vlogs. you seemed the most layed back and creative keep that shit up schlatt
schlatt, I love you.
How the hell does schlatt of all people get sponsored to play this game months early
The skin walkers these days, makes them look so real.
Tbh I thought the reaction content was a really prolonged joke that nobody got
This is the biggest change since "Schlatt" went into hiding after what he did in 1999
The Fahrenheit thing is so true, if I step outside in 100 degree weather and somebody says “um it’s actually 37 degrees” I’m gonna slap the shit outta them because it FEELS like 100 FUCKING DEGREES
You look so much like brenttv
I’ll miss jachlatt
Woo!
condolences
Excited for the change buddy
Wow can’t believe schlatt made me watch his video twice again. He has to be stopped…
Schlatt will yell about go back to primal times where you’re just sipping up the water from the river but will also go on a 12 minute rant about a paper straw getting mushy
Or bring back the original channel
Bout time sellout
As a canadian, I use farenheit and metric.
Oh finally I mean I liked the first 4. I think. But I found myself listening to your podcasts more. Now I can actively watch the videos! The meat. The podcast'll still be listened to, but yayyyy
LETS GO NO MORE TIKTOKS!
They gave him a green screen so we don't think he's in jail
looking cute in the thumbnail
Swag.
Can't wait until jschlatt colabs with vinesauce Vinny and/or joel
A world without the Jonathan Scollat is a world I don't wanna live in. Rest easy big S ❤
Love the 2 playing in the back
Rest in pieces 🕊️
rip slung
Rip big man
"Things are about to change" sounds like a threat, can't wait for the sequal to the queen incident
I was going to say the user submissions aren’t really reactions like most other ones
Dayz!!!
If ya gotta pound a handle of Tito’s before turning on the camera, it’s a sign you don’t enjoy what you’re about to do
Rest in peace, Schlack.
Perfect day for the comeback
I wonder how "Schlatt's" friends are doing after the incident
well done, schlatt.
YES FAHRENHEIT IS BETTER THAN CELSIUS THANK YOU SCHLATT YOU ARE THE GOAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Me as a hoi4 player when I hear schlatt say "Paradox": Confused screaming*
hey good for you man, I like the videos where you are passionate and happy more anyway
Hope schaltt made it to heaven(probably didn’t) I can still hear his voice 🙏🙏🙏 rest in peace big man.
Fly low Big Guy, may Satan have mercy on your soul 🕊🕊🕊🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️
dayum it makes me feel like he's still here. thanks jambo for posting this ❤❤
i have plenty of evidence
Ok shcitty
did jambo finally unlock a new skin in the battle pass
That intro was hilarious
2:31 does he know?
He really got out of jail to make a video for us.
im happy if you are happy as long as you are enjoying it :D
Gret video "Schlatt" so happy he recored it before he died, and thanks Jambo for posting this. "Schlatt" will be missed.
This guy does a really good Jschlatt impression
i love the ranting videos, cant wait to see more of those.
You LOVE Black Men
Thank fuck. I missed the fun schlatt
bro i actually enjoyed the reaction videos so much
What he did in 1999 tipped the scales too far on the “self enjoyment” side
Rip schlip❤ fly high brotha
You should do some video / streaming some old PC games and react to how good or awful they are it would be very entertaining.

Rip shatt almost like he's still here. Thank jambo for posting this!
It really must be so crazy that your most liked videos are basically other people's videos. I hope that doesn't make our boy shlagg insecure about his ability to be funny himself.
Can’t wait for that tier lists
A little over a year ago schlatt also had nothing to do with the queen of England
joke comments aside the thing where schlatt's face loses more and more joy as he uploads more tiktok videos is smart whether it was on purpose or not, i actually really like the detail
LET'S FUCKING GO, NO MORE TIK TOK
Guys, the real reason he has been missing is because he was on trial for what happened on September 8, 2022
so?
Welcome back schlong!!! So happy they didn't find the 39 burried
Rip schlatt. It’s almost like he’s still here
Fly high big guy.🕊
Dude.. celcius is just 0 is cold and 100 is very very very very very very very hot
WOO NICE “SCHLATT”’S FINALLY BACK!! (from prison) Can’t wait for the new content big guy
LETS GO JSCHLATT
I'm here for the vids in my eyes   👍
THIS IS THE COMEBACK WEVE BEEN WAITING FOR <3
fly high 🕊🕊 look for the light
Rest In Peace Schlatt. Don’t worry I will keep on smiling.
YAY
Hell yeah big guy!
finally
me: in the middle of a dumb little essay about how Celsius is better schlatt: calls me out halfway through me: deletes
THANK FUCKING GOD
2:32 but youre amercian
Tampere
do another annual dodgeball tournament pretty please
Schlatt version of San Francisco  - Low Rent, some pollution, Good government  - High Rent, 100% pollution, Horrible government, dead grandparents, 100% taxes
Bro has anyone seen the town of fluck this this is who made that city slat did
I think jschlatt would’ve bean  the perfect person to play William Afton in his younger years specifically when he kills Charlotte Emily
He came back from the grave with some facts about Fahrenheit
This is a memorial of Jschlatt's final moments  RIP He will be missed 😢
Yeah, thank god schlog has some self respect now, really proud of you schlig schlag sjsindjx
name reasons why farenheit
Man I'm gonna miss shlongg, he was always well known for his reaction content. Rest in peace man😔
If you fucking measure temperature with Farenheit System don't expect yourself getting any bitches
Uhh why is he saying this near the 11th..
You can’t upload a video called this on the anniversary of the queens death
Schlatt play openttd again if you think youd enjoy it pleaseee
rest easy, scat, you'll be missed forever and ever. rip 🕊⚰⚱
thank you for taking my eyeballs and getting paid for it big man
We can almost still hear his voice, rest in peace king :(
I remember the last time things changed in september
rest in peace, king. you will be missed 🕊️💔
Been a big fan of the reaction videos. Completely understandable if it isn’t going to be continued & I’m hyped for the tier list
I’m so glad to see u back I knew u we’re probably dealing with a lot of personal/ private stuff and thats why this channel has taken a backseat but I’m glad most of us were patient and understanding about it. Now I can’t wait for all the content to come! Thanks for everything man :))
I know what you did in 1999 and I have evidence.
Gotta do what you enjoy or you’ll get burnt out. Missed Jschnugit while he was away.
Big Guy is right. Fahrenheit is unironically better for human temperature measurement. Humans can feel a lot and the jump from like 30 to 32 Celsius is a lot for humans. Having more numbers and variety that can more accurately tell you the weather is just better for us.   Honorary WHAT THE FUCK IS A KILOMETER!! 🦅🦅🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🦅🇺🇸🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🇺🇸🦅🦅🦅🦅🇺🇸🦅🦅🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
This guy looks alot like this guy i used to watch on youtube… sad… do hope the mans in a better place now ..
i wish he was still here, this ai is getting really good 😭🙏🙏🙏
Celsius > Fahrenheit  You can fight me in the octagon on that
He’s back
Time to screen record some memes on Sunday and send them on Monday if you know what I mean😏😏😏
the hell is  Fahrenheit?- but also good o see you back Schlatt!
2:03 Schlatt with the absolute worst take as per
gotta dislike for having a shit take on temperature
Maybe some YouTube shorts reactions ?
Rest in peace
For the love of everything, please play MORE DAYZ MAN
HES BACK FROM PRISON
Super glad you’re back, Schlatt. Going through depression. Real, rough, fucking-you-in-the-ass depression. YouTube is stale and boring, so I’m happy my favorite YouTuber’s coming back to make my painful days a little better
No one asked
Can we get some rage games? 😮
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
"Cities Skylines is one of my favorites"  Damn... You left out the OG. Not even an honorable mention- 😔
Fahrenheit makes the most sense for people to use. It just makes more sense. 100 is hot, 70 is like warm, 50 cold and so on
my father is snoring and i couldnt even hear a single word you said and im wearing headphones you may ask yourslef "how does he snore THAT loud?" ima be honest with you, i have no fucking idea
i would recommend watching this in 2x speed schlatts just yaps yaps yaps all video grow up bro yip yip yap yappy yappy yappy yaappppp blah blah blah stfu sir yapsalot stop blabbing and make real videos
Congrats Jay shatty! Funny video
RIP big man :(
Its like hes still here </3
Restroom in peace jschlatt 😔
rip schlatt, he will be missed, prison was probably really rough
Noooo the tiktok reactions are going away?!?!
ome year since schlatt tangoed with lizzie
Bro mentioned how he wasn't doing tiktok reaction vids anymore unless he needs money. Then he goes on to make an entire sponsored video on some lame ass game. Really turned over a new leaf here jschlizzle
Since you don’t want an essay on why Celsius is better than Fahrenheit (even though Celsius is clearly better), here’s an essay on the New England and Southern Colonies and how there climate and geographical status affected them. The New England colonies had rocky soil and harsh winters, which made it impossible to run their economy on agriculture. They instead turned to Earth’s largest ecosystem; the ocean. They began fishing, and soon enough their economy ran on fishing, whaling, and with the help of the large supply of wood, ship building.  Unlike the New England colonies, the Southern colonies had rich land that was perfect for crops. The had mild winters and the climate was ideal for agriculture, and so their economy was built on that. The English’s first town of settlers, Jamestown VA, took advantage of this and built their economy on Tobacco. This really built the dependency on slave work throughout America as the number of plantations grew with the number of fields. Please correct mistakes, I have to turn this in for a grade. Glad to see you have escaped imprisonment and the clutches of the Grim Reaper.
Rest in peace jschlatt… we miss you
I know schlatt was innocent so glad he's back
Was the smiling less and less in the thumbnails intentional? Or just a natural consequence of the government getting closer to the truth of what happened in 1999?
I had the exact same opinion about Celsius and people called me crazy
I PRAYED FOR THIS WE ARE SO BACK
Nah wtf this is the funniest coincidence. Literally like six hours ago I was re-watching all of the old city skyline videos because I hadn’t watch them in like a year. A couple hours later he drops this video. What the fuck
GOD BLESS THE AGE OF HORROR IS OVER
The react content really was way better when it was streamed. I honestly enjoyed those videos more even when you weren't reading the chat.
lol i remember watching the stream and being so confused at how the fuck slchlatt thought kelvin was a dev and not a tempeture.
Guys let's blackmail Schlatt again for jail until he does tiktok reactions
Metric system is much better for science cuz fuck doing conversions in imperial. But "schlart" is right. 100 F is hot as balls and 0 F is colder than a witch's t- anyways a 0-100 rating of comfort makes much more sense!
0:43 but Schlatt, what about the countless channels based on your content,  not to mention smile incorporated
would have been better if it was just a 2 second video saying "i quit" and then he deletes all of his videos inexplicably leaving the internet forever
So glad he's back in time to celebrate the anniversary of 9/11
that makes at least twice now that schlatt has dissapeared felt like quittinq and did entirly new content
proud of you for doing this big man keep up the good stuff (and most importantly the stuff that makes you happy) can’t wait to see what u come up with next!
I'm so happy he's back
LETS GOO BIG GUY!!!!!!!
More gaming let’s go!
Can’t believe how real AI is getting. We all know the real Jschlatt is in prison.
They should add Florida to the game so you can sink it
Man does it feel good when I get a hot upload from the Big Guy
Thanks for uploading this vod, Jambo. Great tribute. Fly high schlatt 🕊
hey schlatt you should do more reaction videos
No more TikTok reactions? I'm killing myself
FINALLY, LETS FUCKING GOOOO
Pppoffoiiiiiiiiiuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
FINALLY NO MORE TIKTOK CONTENT
Farenheit is SOOO much better than Celsius and whatever the fukk kelvin is.
Nice!
<3
Celsius >
shut up
Would be really funny if he was also running for congress
*sees schlatt post a video with this title*  *remembers what he died to the queen and what he did on september 11th back in '01*  oh no...
Matpat pose in the thumbnail
The AI is very convincing.
“Wtf Is A Kilometer?!?!!?!” Rank windows computers. If you see this comment like it. (Everyone) If you see this comment, pin it. I want a Microsoft Windows Tier List! I swear you’re fans like those computer and apple is a piece of crap.
Yay🎉
Kelvin solos
Waiting for the reaction video next
Fahrenheit is superior, it's basically a percentage of how hot it is relative to the human body
Will you make 40-min analysis vids again?
What makes fahrenheit better than Celsius tho?
where is my shlanket, "shlatt"?
nobody gonna talk about how schlatt made a better san fransico than the one we have irl 💀
Farenheit is actually generally based on a 0-100 scale of how hot people feel, which is why 60-70 is comfortable temperature, we like to be warm but not hot. Anything that exceeds the 0-100 scale is considered extreme.  So yes, to humans Farenheit makes more sense.
Is it just me or is his head abnormally round
This man is so charming and handsome. Strong moral values. Majestic smile and strangely confederate beard. His face screams character, his eyes horrors. I wait in crumbling patience for this man’s new content.
"Celcius is fucking stupid." - an american
Schlatt i just want you to know if you dont want to upload anymore and want to focus more on your personal life thats ok and i will always be a loyal subscriber. Do what you feel😊
rip “schlorp” i can still hear his voice, almost like he’s still with us 😢
I think he needs to play some doodle jump
schlatt you cut out that part of the fahrenheit clip where you conceded immediately after
Glad you beat those charges king! 👑 (Like how twomad beat that girl)
did schalatt just post the first gameplay video on cities skylines isn't it still on embargo??????????
Two kitties now? Video when?
2:31 Well… 70% of me is, so mathematically… kind?
Schlatt is here baby we’re so fucking back
more
Been a fan since sept 11th 2001, ill never forget what you did on that day, its so sad to see him go now. RIP Janklatt 🙏
Would love more jackbox videos too
DAWG WHYS EVERYONE SAYING HES DEAD WHATD I MISS
Schoolshooter you loom gae
Bruh my phone is listening to me wtf. In chemistry we had a lesson what the difference is between Fahrenheit Kevin and Celsius and this is the first thing that comes up on YouTube wtf lol
glad to see the direction you're taking this channel in!
Fuck Fahrenheit lol
It's a wonder what AI can do, really good to see him one last time, RIP Big Guy
rest in peace schlatt. i can’t believe we lost you. we love you so so much. thanks for uploading this jambo, we hope you get a new home soon.   and schlatt? hope you meet my great great grandpop, adolf, down there. fly high.
Did...did you change all those Tik Tok Reaction thumbnails for a bit? Because if not, holy shit you actually did smile less each time.
its almost like he is still there... rest in peace, Schlatt
In the world of temperature measurement, two systems stand out: Celsius and Fahrenheit. While both have their merits, the Celsius system, with its simplicity, international standardization, and scientific consistency, emerges as the superior choice.  Simplicity and Intuitiveness: The Celsius scale is celebrated for its simplicity and intuitive nature. It is based on the freezing and boiling points of water at sea level: 0°C for freezing and 100°C for boiling. This straightforward range makes it easy for people to relate to everyday temperatures. On the other hand, the Fahrenheit scale lacks such intuitive reference points, making it less user-friendly.  International Standard: Celsius has gained widespread acceptance and usage across the globe. It is the preferred temperature measurement system in most countries and is used in scientific research, meteorology, and international weather reports. This standardization simplifies communication and ensures consistency in temperature reporting, making Celsius a global language of temperature.  Scientific Consistency: Celsius is aligned with the Kelvin scale, which is the standard unit of temperature measurement in scientific calculations. This alignment is crucial for scientific research and ensures a seamless transition between different temperature scales. In contrast, the Fahrenheit system lacks a direct relationship with Kelvin, making it less compatible with scientific applications.
Schlatt i know you wont see this and i know im a drop in a bucket But regarding to that one weekly slap video where u said "we are all replaceable" like youtubers. I think its bullshit,NO MATTER WHAT format type of video project IDEC you make i catch myself watching that shit 100 times over  Ive watched chuckle sandwish every episode 12 times, sleep deprived 4, ur jackbox videos 34 times your gaming stuff all like 8 times YOU ARE IRREPLACEABLE  We are replaceable. Your comedic, (and economic) genius  will always find an audience on whatever platform you decide to go. We are replaceable, the fans. You are a one of a kind jschlatt  You arent successful because of clickbait or the usual trend following like some larger youtubers. I think you have an actual heart and a personality thats so goddamn specific which matches so goddamn well with youtube you cant replicate that. Thats years of choices and life Hich shaped you. And i think you can even see this in tommyinnit who takes after you in his behavior (he def milked minecraft n clickbaited) but its weird but i see how he keepsbthat same (i guess) "open" mannerism with the audience. Sure there are more people Ho also have grown like this (ex: techno, ted, ...) but each of those is unique  I think anyone could do what mrbeast does (with the friend groep, the hyperactivity, money, insane ideas, a fill team) and many clones exist but you are one of a kind mr I appreciate you a hell lot more than you realise
Don't worry Big Guy, soon I'll find the evidence
Go back on the SDP 🤬🤬🤬
The Not Just Bikes for like 1 second made me laugh so hard bro
man this channel had like the only good reaction content on here. glad there will still be some tho
🤓
it's almost like he is alive again with us, thank you AI!
Hey Schlatt, Id love to see you do another video about Rollercoaster Tycoon, under-appreciated classic.
thanks schit!
I thought it said things are about to cringe
looking forward to the new content. this video was definitely a 10/10, would recommend ;)
you have that smug mona lisa face in the thumbnail
Don’t worry Jschlatt we will support you and your new boyfriend it’s hard to come out but remember we will always watch your content
rest in peace
The end of another era 🥲
all of this and my shlanket still has not arrived
Humans can live without extreme heat resistant or cold resistant cloths between 0-100 F so it’s great
This is what he said right before he killed the queen of England
Thank god, he's back
The hat comes off?
glad to see "schlatt" is back :)
I’m surprised schlatt could make San Francisco even worse
NEW YORK
10:00 didn't expect a dark souls reference in a city building game
Didn’t think he would ever get out of prison but he did it 🎉🎉
Let’s goooooooo! More/New content
Big man
I’m so glad Schlag actually didn’t die 😁
THANK GOD NO MORE REACTIONS
My birthday is October 24th
Rip “schlatt” he will be missed ❤️🕊️
Finally
Bro you killed a monarch why do you think you would be allowed anywhere in Europe
RIP Jschlatt. the videos were great
Man I watch this live, the full VOD, and this video. We are so back.
BOYS HE. IS. BACK.
i will miss the reaction vids but im glad you are doing something you want to do!
wow, it’s like i can still hear him.. fly high shligg 😞🙏
I love your hair king x
Birthday men
Ranking videos are the only ones i never watch. even less entertaining than reaction vids
schlatt i think i just met your brother at a cybersecurity event
God it still hurts so bad, I can't believe he's gone. At least he lives on through the footage Jambo uploads for us. RIP Jshuffle gone to soon 😢🕊️❤
fresh outta prison and schlatt somehow finds a way to make San Francisco worse
JGoon
welcome back, father
no, tell me why The ad for this video was about a movie called bottoms💀💀💀
Very happy that reaction submissions are coming back, they felt much more meaningful interaction and had some of the funniest stuff
Nah fuck Fahrenheit abd Celsius Kelvin is where its at  Its starts at 0 and you die at 333
Is it just me or, does schlatt look a little majestic in the thumbnail??
Where are the schlanets at bro. just tell me something
Rest in peace shatt, so sad to see that what you did in Vietnam finally caught up to you. Rest in pieces ❤
This is it guys he's gonna become GaySchaltt
6:00 i think you mean welcome to Texas 😂
Finally. LIVE.
THANK FUCK. I hated the reaction shit from the first episode. It was just not funny at all and really aimed towards the Minecraft dream kids. Thank you for coming back Schlatt, now I can wear my fund the balls sweater with pride.
I know he said he likes to keep work separate from his own time and he like to play Dayz in his own time BUT I MISS THE OLD DAYZ DAYS. :/
Rest in peace, big man. You will be missed 🕊️
the reason I like Celsius is because, -30 is very cold, 0 is water freezing, 30 is hot, 100 is boiling.
celsius better nerd
👍
Wow...AI is getting better and better every day.
ok that tokyo lens joke got me crying LMAO
He should do some irl go karts
ok ima just make my claim over the whole measurments argument BOTH ARE GREAT IF NOT ALL metric is good for like scientific shit because its all 1:1 well more 10:1 because its base 10 but you get it imperial is good for specific measurments like ohh im 5,6 5 foot 6 inches instead of like 1.359 meters or some shit (i looked it up i was decently close on that conversion without actually converting) large lengths should be in meters for easy scaling or very specific lengths (i just looked up if seconds are metric or imperial i was curious so seconds are metric but why the fuck are minutes and hours imperial?) smaller lengths should be imperial if they're just basic like ohh 2 feet of a 2x4 or something smaller smaller like fucking microscopic then use metric just cuz its somehow perfectly alligned with the size of atoms idk how the fuck it is it just is how the fuck did some bitch in 1760 or some shit manage to align it that well? weight it doesnt fucking matter lbs kg g oz doesnt matter kg is good for measuring lots of items that only weigh grams grams are good for precision ounces a little useless though are just the inches of pounds except 16 not 12 and I WILL FINALLY SETTLE THIS ONE ENGINEERING SHOULD BE ALL IMPERIAL THATS IT THATS FINAL IF IT IS EVER METRIC IT SHOULD BE FOR GOOD REASON EITHER SCALING A SMALL SCALE PROTOTYPE BECAUSE ITS ALL BASE 10 FOR EASE OF SCALING OR SOME SHIT TO DO WITH LIKE HOW THE MATERIAL IS USED OR ACTS  dont argue with me on that ok thats like some AR vs AK shit there are videos of kalashnikov and eugene stoner  talking about their rifles like ohh your rifle is great you did a great job on it while some bitch cries about their hunk of metal and fiberglass being better than the other bitches brick of rivets and shitty plastic  it all is great its just designed to fit different roles metric is DESIGNED for science due to how precise it is around certain physical things imperial is DESIGNED for everyday use as its based around the size and shit of common objects
I'll kinda miss jschlatt reacting to tiktoks because of his good reactions, but if it means him returning to streaming, gaming videos, actual ranking, and ranting, I'm all in with the decision. Excited with future videos now.
Comment for the algorithm
Love how most of the video is just clips without TTS because the TTS’s were so bad XD
He's seen too much Weezer
Do what you want Sir Schlatt, us mindless numbskulls will keep watching   Also, you should do more stuff like “Spend A Day In Tokyo With Me,” really loved your take on that type of content
Rest in peace big man. It's such a shame that fentanyl took him at such a young age 🙏🙏🙏
i use kelvin
Cant believe schlatt is out of prison after such a short sentence considering what he did in '99
Thank fucking god
Should’ve photo shopped the chops off for the thumbnail with a title like that. So many people would’ve shit themselves.
Nice, I was really sick of the reaction videos
Thank fucking god, i hated the reaction videos so much, cant wait for some real content.
apel jucie
Rip shlagg
AI is getting too good, it’s like he’s still here🙏🙏 fly high big guy❤
👏
Kelvin is better
Bro i legit said hes been smiling less and less on his last vid
It's funny that Schlatt couldn"t fly out of the country....either means he never got the 💉 or he's on the FBI No-Fly list
It’s been hard without him, im glad that his cats could post this after his passing, it’s almost like he’s with us 😢
Nah Kelvin is the best temp measurement
WE ARE SO BACK🎉🎉🎉
i dont care what this man uploads i will watch it as soon as possible
i just had the best fan interaction with this big guy! he was saying stuff like “hey get out of my attic” and “stop watching me through my window”!! truly the best interaction i’ve had with a celeb!!
I’m glad schlatt is back just in time for both of the anniversaries
Jschlatt can’t go to Germany because he cannot be within 2 miles of the German chancellor. Remember 1998? All schlatt’s fault.
dude youre just a funny little guy.. now make a fucking tik tok reaction video right now
We need a Jambo reacts to video series
YES MORE RANKINGBLES GOOOOOOOOOOO
I am all for youtubers milking a series, get your bags kings. But react content in particular can get super repetitive and dull. It was only a matter of time before boredom and forced overreacting finally killed Jschlunk. RIP Schlick, gone but forgotten, fly diagonal 🕊️
RIP Schatl you’ll be missed 🙏🕊️🕊️
Schlatt playing god and destroying entire family’s for our entertainment is truly inspiring❤ keep up the work schlagg!
WAIT YOUR ALIVE?!?!?
thankgod
Glad ur back from prison u almost died man.
Rest in peace big guy. Hope ur doing well down there
The temperature system just depends on where you lived, for more than a decade you just absorb information on what all of these degrees actually mean. 15 degrees means nothing if you never actually felt it. On that note celcius is objectively better in my professional opinion, but honestly it has a simpler way to find out whenether water turned into ice and how thick that ice is which is useful when winter lasts half of the year.
Literally yesterday went huh I haven't heard from schlatt in awhile I'll sub and make sure I see the next video. BAM!
Rest in peace sheggg you will be missing indeed
can’t wait for him to upload in 6 months
Thank fucking god the reaction videos are done.
Rest easy big man 🕊 he can finally apologize to the people he desecrated in 1991
k'know i stopped watching reaction vids from ya as it was clear it got stale. I enjoyed watching the other stuff you were doin and honestly its great to hear you're doing more variety content. when i saw you do that city skylines stream it was so much better than "haha funni" so this is a step in a great direction, and i'll make a point to support your content that isnt that stuff
so what are you gon do boy make an ass tier list or something? i know you love ass boy dont u lie
Good riddance the repetitive nonsense.
thank fuck honestly i love the older reaction content when it was streamed but the second you stopped actually enjoying it it was just awful to watch hopefully once you go back to having fun I'll enjoy your content like i used to
Thank you schlaft. I stopped watching you, but now I will. Now I have the will to live another Tuesday.
I know it's not that important that water freezes below 0 degrees Celsius and boils at one hundred degrees Celsius, but at least it's something.  Mister Fahrenheit defined 0 °F as the freezing point of brine. Idk about you, but I will never use that in my entire life.
so glad shclatts finally back from, being held in a cell after the queens death because the evidence didnt hold.
Glad you back buddy 💗💗💗💗💗
nice to have you back
the numbers for Fahrenheit are what it feels like, i.e. it feels like 92% hot outside! therefore, its 92 degrees fahrenheit. think of fahrenheit as based off what it feels like to you, and for Celsius think of what it feels like to water
Damnit the react videos were my favorite
Great news, love viewer submissions.
He’s alive
super happy to see schlatt enjoying himself again
FINALLY
Schlatt thinking Fahrenheit is better than celsius is certainly one way to demonstrate he was never a chemistry/physics student
Although i enjoyed the tiktok reactions i'm happy jschlatt is moving on and coming back to streaming, that city skylines stream was probably the most fun i've had in a long time, i'll be looking forward on what big guy has to offer <3
WHOOOOOOOO NO MORE LAZY REACTION CONTENT
fahrenheit is much better, it’s relative to how it feels to a human rather than being based off some other material. also thank fuck you’re getting rid of the reaction content
NO MORE RANKING OF TIK TOKS WOOOO
nobody👏gives👏a👏flying👏shit!
Still miss u big guy ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘😘❤️😘❤️❤️😘❤️😘😘
Can’t wait for JSchlatt to show us how he will make 1999 look like a pushover
They have a 1999 amount of evidence
He’s gone to meet the queen 😢 RIP Schwarma 1967-2022
Can't wait for jshit to start his mediocre music career
actual content 🔥🔥
Shlatt never fails to disappoint ❤️
Schlatt, you behave good sir!
Genuinely, EVERYTHING that has the Schlatt name in it is a comedic masterpiece. I do not care if it's tiktok videos or something else, I will watch it regardless. Do what makes you happy king.
Glad to see the "watching memes" part of your streams isnt going away, cause those were some of my favorite. But you are definitely right in that they are way more fun to not only watch live, but watch knowing your viewers has control over what was posted. otherwise, im very exited to see where this part of your channel goes, and keep up the good work
man, i keep coming back to watch his videos. i miss him so much. rest in power big guy 💔🕊️
Disliked for metric system
Thank fucking god, dude. Welcome back.
It’s such a shame big guy died in prison for his actions in 1999.
J schlaggy 😍
I'm so happy he's back to good content
why do you look like kano from MK11
At least Schlinket can visit the big Germany up in the sky 🕊RIP
Fly high Schlussy! Thank you for posting this Jambo!
Time to think...
RIP Schlatt, its like I can feel him coming inside of me with this video
So glad Schlump scheduled one last upload before he left this earth
rip "schlong"     I hope Jambo is in a good place
“Fahrenheit is better then Celsius” said the liar
Kelvin >>> Celsius & Fahrenheit
Fahrenheit is how humans feel. Celsius is how the water feels, so yeah it does make less fucking sense
Big man will u be streaming starfield?
Buy more guns
I clicked on this video thinking “oh yeah schlagnot is gonna talk about changes for like 10 minutes or more” and then two minutes in I just see him playing city skylines. Jambo is a true genius
schlatt is always wrong, no matter what, CELCIUS US SUPERIOR!!
❤❤😂
FINALLY
WOOOOOOOOO
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOO
Glad your back from prison, how was it escaping? Did you crawl through the vents? Did you swim in the toilet? Let’s us know big man we’re waiting
thanks for doing something else now the only  reason i watched those videos is because you u literally wouldn't upload anything else but i needed any excuse to watch more jschlatt (atleast you got the sleep deprived channel)
To raise the temperature of 1 mL (1cm x 1cm x 1cm) by 1 degree Celsius is one calorie, such is metric
If you look closely, the San Fransisco landmass is actually 5 dudes making out.
It was about time!
Celsius vs. Fahrenheit: Why Celsius Is the Superior Temperature Scale  Introduction  Temperature is a fundamental aspect of our daily lives, influencing everything from weather forecasts to cooking recipes and scientific research. While there are several temperature scales used worldwide, the two most prevalent are Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F). This essay will argue that the Celsius scale is superior to the Fahrenheit scale for several reasons, including its simplicity, ease of conversion, and alignment with the metric system, making it the more practical and logical choice for global temperature measurement.  Simplicity and Logical Zero Point One of the primary reasons Celsius is superior to Fahrenheit is its simplicity and logical zero point. In the Celsius scale, water freezes at 0°C and boils at 100°C at standard atmospheric pressure. This scale is straightforward and aligns perfectly with the fundamental characteristics of water, a substance essential to life and omnipresent in our environment.  In contrast, the Fahrenheit scale is based on the arbitrary freezing and boiling points of a mixture of water, ice, and salt. Water freezes at 32°F and boils at 212°F in this scale, which lacks the intuitive connection to nature that the Celsius scale offers. The choice of these reference points seems arbitrary and can lead to confusion, especially for international travelers or when working with scientific data.  Metric System Alignment Another compelling reason for preferring Celsius over Fahrenheit is its alignment with the metric system, which is the global standard for scientific measurement and international trade. The Celsius scale is based on a decimal system, where each degree represents an equal interval. This makes it compatible with other metric units, simplifying calculations in scientific research and engineering.  On the other hand, the Fahrenheit scale employs irregular intervals, making it less compatible with the metric system. This inconsistency can complicate calculations and conversions, requiring additional steps to integrate Fahrenheit temperatures into metric-based equations. In contrast, Celsius simplifies these processes, reducing the likelihood of errors in scientific experiments and day-to-day activities.  Global Consistency The adoption of the Celsius scale promotes global consistency and simplifies communication. Most countries around the world use the Celsius scale as the standard for weather reporting and scientific research. This consistency allows people from different regions to understand and relate to temperature measurements easily, fostering global cooperation and understanding.  Fahrenheit, conversely, is primarily used in the United States, leading to a lack of uniformity in temperature reporting. This can create confusion when dealing with international partners or when interpreting data from diverse sources. Celsius provides a common language for discussing temperature worldwide, streamlining global communication and collaboration.  Everyday Practicality Celsius also offers practical advantages in everyday life. Most scientific guidelines, medical recommendations, and weather forecasts are presented in Celsius, making it easier for people to make informed decisions regarding their health, safety, and daily activities. Furthermore, Celsius is more intuitive for cooking and household purposes since it corresponds directly to the temperature range at which humans live and function.  Conclusion  In conclusion, Celsius is a superior temperature scale compared to Fahrenheit due to its simplicity, logical zero point, alignment with the metric system, global consistency, and everyday practicality. Celsius provides a more intuitive and standardized approach to measuring temperature, which is essential for scientific research, international cooperation, and everyday life. While Fahrenheit may hold historical significance, its limitations make Celsius the more logical and practical choice for the modern world.
NO MORE TIKTOKS!!! WOOOO  Shshdjsgdbdifgdidh FINALLY
I got the fucking Burger King ad on this video 💀
Meeting Schlatt in Florida was amazing !! He skinned me alive and turned my skin into a yootooz plushie :3
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENo more tiktok
His "schlussy" is open for financial obligations
Celsius is superior to Fahrenheit and remember dude, you make millions.  Once you're rich most people lose their touch with reality and get "bored" or feel "unhappy" - like, no. This is just objectively wrong.  People being homeless are unhappy. People that lost their loved ones are unhappy. People with cancer, knowing they are going to miss out on so much life has to offer, are unhappy. I really can't see you being unhappy no offense dude but with that kinda money you literally can't be unhappy - impossible.
What?? 😥 I was looking forward to "Ranking your UNHINGED Tik Toks!"
Only truly intelligent people use Kelvin over Fahrenheit and Celsius.
I love the creativity with some of the earlier reaction content, I hope he continues to find joy in his future projects and ventures
Hope you run out of money lol
I'm so sorry Schlatt about what happened. We already miss you ;(
Can we get the full version of the Wii Fun Time Extravaganza? Would’ve liked to see all of it
YEEAAAHHHHH
EU frog here, I think in terms of temps, both Fahrenheit and Celsius created good measuring systems, one having a good 0 point, and the other being more precise
No
what a great video to eat cashews to
Big Guy, opinion on Hurricane Lee?
Yappa yippee shlatt content
Looking forward to more Tiktoks 🙏 thank you “schlatt”!
Don't worry big guy. You are always funny. I'm pretty sure I can watch you in anything.
Big guy is BACK! Hopefully we see jschlatt in his chaotic personality again
How they suppose to let you leave the country after the  ✈️🏢🏢
As an american, I can agree that celsius makes no sense.
bros actually posting a year after what he did to every brit in existence💀
LETS GOOOOOO
FINALLY WOOOHOOOOOOOOO
First time I’ve ever watched the vod before the vid
Celsius makes sense for weather, Fahrenheit makes sense for body temperature, Metric makes sense for normal measurement, Imperial makes sense for distance measurement.
I'm actually super excited for this. I've been kind of sick of reaction videos for a while now, and I'm ready for some JSchlatt gaming now
You remind me of that guy from Sleep Deprived.
Holy fuck everything about this, especially the fahrenheit celcius thing, screams classic schlatt is returning to us
LETS GOOO HES BACK FROM PRISON‼️‼️
Water fly at 100, water hard at 0. Moving on
It's nice to see "Schlatt" making a change
I always loved his conetnt so sad he’s gone and didn’t have a green card and got rip’d
it is so sad that  he died (it is around the time the queen died last year coincidence ? i think not) he finaly got what he deserved RIP big guy 🕊🕊
September 8th you posted this today for a reason. Also it's my birthday
Rest in peace schlatt His mom made an ai of him to forget he shot himself infront of 3 gooners My condolonces Schlatts mom
fucking finally real content and no more prison this is awsome
i am so happy that we are done with the tik tok reaction videos, i could tell he was doing it mindlessly and for views i’m so happy we can get real “schlatt” content now!!!
Most original comment on here: (Another rip jshat) (most annoying shit ever)
You can be the next jerma, i believe in you.  Reactions videos are fun with your reactions as well big guy
Rate the profile pics of ur biggest donators to milk your audience like a good content creator
the queen died a year ago
I love men 🕊️
I played the first one when it had a version on mobile
That sounds like a great plan, big guy! If you do feel like streaming some chill games again, it would be super cool if you played power wash simulator again. It's one of my all time favourite vods
nf change yes yes
cool now fix ur merch i blew money on the schlatt hat months ago and never got it.
but the tiktok videos were funnyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
1:58 I personally consider myself a metric system supremasist.....   But yeah celsius is stupid, but so is farenheit... both are incredibly dumb, and most of the time, if you really want to work on some science stuff, you're gonna need to change to kelvin anyways...   So how about we just forget about celsius, we throw Fahrenheit to the garbage bin where it belongs, and we just... use kelvin!
so happy that he finally saw how stupid the tiktok reactions were ❤❤❤❤
Oh no, jschlatt will bring upon the rapture.
yippe
Dude hell yes I've never liked reaction vids but I've always loved all your other stuff
It's hard being here without you. RIP Schlabia
all jschlatt videos will always be great videos 🫡
Holy shit he lives...
Can you start doing dayz streams again
I can't believe he finally came out as Bi! Good for you "Schlatt"
I'm glad you're doing what makes you happy
I’m so glad Jambo posted this for all of us to see after he was gone 💔💔 we’ll miss you jshlutt 🕊️
shlatt is not very smart, i will refrain from listening to his opinions
Schlatt is no longer a Sssniperwolf clone. The darkest of days are over, lads. 🙏
Been missing that sweet sweet schlussy
After this video was posted, a series of government building’s inexplicably blew up
celcius clears fahrenheit
Idc PRISONER
Dude skylines 2 launches on my birthday
wide face, looking like a cake
RIP Jschlatt thank you Jambo for posting this. schlatt will be kinda missed.
Hello schlotterbotter 👋
WW
Fahrenheit is superior especially since it’s mostly how it feels out of 100. It’s 32 degrees? That’s kinda cold. If it’s 102 that’s way too damn hot
welcome back from prison schlatt! I'm so happy to see you again <3
Sleep deprived better
Trevor is such a fantastic person, cant wait to se what you guys make
Oh thank god
yeah but... 0 = cold  100 = warm,       thonk it like percentages :}     and yes we are water
0:54 he is time to smile confirmed?!!
October 24 is my birthday!!
RIP
Rest in peace
I thought “jSHLAT” was just preparing for another purge of his chat or for another ____ like the one he did in 87
we'll miss you... Fly High 🕊🕊
LETS GOO, NO MORE TIKTOK REACTION VIDEOS
cgi has gotten so advanced, i can almost smell him 😔
Soup!
Bro thinks he’s quirky with that clickbait thumbnail, he doesn’t I will use it as my cum-material.
RIP the big man, it's almost like he's still here with us. Fly high 🕊🕊🕊🕊🕊
im so glad “schlat” is finally back from “prison”! “welcome” back “buddy”!
Lets fucking goooooo!
jambo licking the other one in the background
most accurate reconstruction of that fabulous city, thanks liberals :)
WE HAVE BEEN FREED
This is too fast
Fuck fahrenheit, sincerely angry andy.
everyone using fahrenheit is stupid as fuck
Glad to know the polic haven't found out what schlatt didn't  1999
The first frame
Soon Jschlatt,  soon              Look at the date
This reminds me of no face cam schlatt and bonk does anyone remember bonk
I lost it when J Schlatt bulldozed the cemetery 💀
yoooo lets gooo
while celcius is ass, fahrenheit is also pretty bad. kelvin is wayyy better than both because the numbers actually MEAN something
LETS GOOOO FINALLY NO MORE REACTION VIDEOS🙏🙏
Who are you.
FINALYL BRO
I knew that series was dragging you down as a whole as soon as it stopped being streamed. The joy and the fun for you were gone and that's a huge part of it. No one wants to be laughing to themselves like a psychopath in some random ass room at 4:30 on a Sunday to farm some youtube impressions. You love being a content creator, and more importantly, being an entertainer. So go do what you love man, we'll be here.
YES! WE GET MORE GAMING SCHLATT! SCHLATT + SLEEP DEPRIVED BEST COMBO!
Below 0 is below freezing above 0 isn’t 😡
YYYYYYYEEEEA BABY
I can still hear him 🕊️❤
SCHLART IS BACK LESS GOO
Can’t believe bro used his astral projection to post this 🙏🙏😭😭
I don't know what it is, but seeing schlatt being genuine about his thoughts after what felt like so long really, even for a moment, really feels nice. This entire video has the same feeling as before the reaction video era, and it's making me happy. The honest nature he shows reminds me of when I would watch theweeklyslap, it's an emotion that i haven't really seen replicated by any other creator.   Suffice to say, I'm happy that this video reminds me of the schlatt I remember and admire. You're a great chaotic creator, and one who has made me genuinely happy a lot of times. Whether you're trying to be entertaining or trying to have an open talk to your viewers and their worries, it always shows how great of a man you are. Never change, schlatt ❤  Also, please never take control of any city, big guy. Волк wouldn't be happy if you did.
I will die on this hill Celsius is just better why! Does farenheit have its freezing temperatures at 32° but then its boiling point at 212? When celsius is 0 and 100. And yes we our water like 60% water so we feel that shit
Surely make schlatt 2024 merch to celebrate not being a complete sell-out anymore!!
It's so sad that mr. jschart died in prison, rest in peace big guy...
Heheh... Thinks we don't have evidence? Hahaha... we are SO *GODDAMN* CLOSE.
Hi.  (Im Devin)
Pls don't leave me daddy
Rip Schluggernaut, we will miss you
L take, Celsius is better than Fahrenheit  & this is coming from a canadian that uses both
Schlatt is completely based about farenheit v celsius.   "But Farenheit isn't actually more intuitive, you're just used to it!" Farenheit is a temperature system for weather. Weather is the only thing that most people use temperature for daily, aside from cooking (for which you really should be using a recipe, the numbers themselves aren't super relevant and most recipes use farenheit anyway). Almost all weather falls between the range of 0-100F, as opposed to celsius, where the range is more like -20-40C. If you can tell me with a straight face that NEGATIVE TWENTY TO FORTY isn't objectively less intuitive than zero to one hundred, I'm sorry, but you're dumb. Farenheit, like most imperial units, is an anthropometric scale. Unlike celsius, which is a scientific measuring system built around water, farenheit is literally constructed for human use. (Just like how, hot take, in the day to day feet/inches is more useful than m/cm)  "B-but Farenheit is arbitrary and Celsius is objective!" Both forms of measurement are actually based on universal constants and are thus equally objective. Plus, 0C and 100C aren't even the exact melting and boiling points of water, they're a bit imprecise   "B-b-but, you can't say "are you a pot of water?" to make fun of me, humans are 70% water!" Yeah, but you die way, way earlier than a pot of water boils. Plus, you may be a pot of water, but is the atmosphere? No! Weather never even breaks 60, meanwhile it gets to sub-freezing all the time. Yeah, negative Farenheit is a thing, but when it is, you know it's really, REALLY cold. Unlike -C which is a lot more common.  Never let Europeans tell you you're wrong big guy, Farenheit is based and the world needs to know that
Can’t wait to see more content big man!!
SCHLATT IS BCK BAAAAAAABYYYYYYY WOOOOOOOO
Schfat
So happy “schlatt” is finally doing more things he enjoys, I’m looking forward to more great streams big guy
2:54 why is there a dead cat next to you?
I don't actually know what this guys been up to. People have been saying he's back to streaming, but his YouTube presence has been fairly dead too, so like, what's he been doing? Just appearing in other people's streams?
glad the US justice system finally did its due diligence and arrested this monster
RIP schlatt 😂😂
2:36 hey.. It's the same with my country and asia.
Oh, buddy. I just haven’t given them the evidence yet… I saw everything Schlatt… eeeeeeeeeeeeverythiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing
Did he go to prison or is that bs everyone is making up? Someone please let me know if this is a woosh moment
Yeah submissions were way better than random tiktok
these phases that schlatt goes through last longer than any one piece arc
Play Sims4 already 😭 it’s simulation game too but with people
Play the bionicle game
Good of you man
This is amazing. Very self aware and heathy. Love the new change
I DO think you should consider watching the memes on your subreddit, that's actual community content, people that enjoy YOU, you could start by looking at the "all time" most liked stuff there.
What a legend kidnapped by germans
Got out of prison the year after he killed the Queen
YIPPEEE🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Schlatt has been forced to do 12 days of work and is at his mental breaking point
So sad.. Schlafly was such a beautiful handsome attractive man to me.. Very sorry I didn't spend more time watching your videos.. 💔
I’ve waited for this day for the longest.
Fahrenheit gang wya?
It’s almost like he is still here with us 😔😔😔 RIP 🪦 💀💀💀
I feel like Celsius is good for cooking, kelvin is good for science, and Fahrenheit is good for everything else
Kelvin is better
Nature is healing ❤️‍🩹
I agree. This don't feel like 23 to 40 degrees. It feels like 105°
Thank you, Schlatt! Life in San Franciscock has never been better!
Wrong
ah yes, the new era of "schlatt"
OH MY GOD IS IT FINALLY OVER?.
but its nearly that time of the year tho
Schlatt: "no more tictok reaction videos"  Me: *YEEEEAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!*
Not going to lie, I stopped watching for a while because i felt the tik tok ones were pretty unoriginal and boring, I’m glad we can get unique content again
I had a great Jschlatt experience in New Jersey! He blinded me in one eye and left me in a shed for 3 hours. Jschlatt is great with his fans
hype big poo
He really has a lot of drafts, miss you hunk of a man😫 RIP jschlatt 🕊️
FUCKING FINALLY SCHLATT IS BRINGING THE TIER LISTS BACK JFC
Jschlatt you're so funny! Keep it up man.
time for mutton chops to go
We back!!!
BIG GUY IS BACK BABYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I thought he was gonna shave or something
Honestly always glad yo see a youtuber focusing on their health and happiness.
Big guy is out of prison guys!
So glad to see they’ve freed you! I always knew you were innocent, except from… the crimes committed 24 years ago
Long live the Schlaticus….. I really like watching shit 😃😃
HE IS BACK
I am SO happy that Mr. J Schlatt is back from Jail and he was shanked because of what happened back in 99
Oh good finally. I thought we had lost you to the void 😂
But Schlatt water freezes below 0 Celsius

Great
Bad news no more funny reaction videos :( Good news new city skylines video :)
here before he changes the title✋
Gone but never forgotten 💔🕊️ "Schlatt" will live on in our hearts, unlike his victims in '99, RIP 💔🕊️
Happy 1 year anniversary "schlutt"
damn so this is the final video he made before his passing ☹️ RIP schladdy
Oh, so Schlatt is gonna change up his cringe content with more content. Glad to see nothing's changed. ;)
You cant leave the country if you are being investigated for the murder of the Queen, just a little tip, Schiat
Rip schlatt, you will always be remembered for what you did in 99.  And 911. And in the underground train. And in Boston. And in Paris during the World Cup And in alot of schools in the US.  You are a true american patriot.
cant wait for the future content this man "schlatt" has made
Thank you Jambo for posting in the memory of Schlatt, I can almost hear him 🥲
props to gamer supps, thanks schlatt
hahaha njb reference
Love that they put a dark souls reference in city skylines 2
missed you
Why does schlatt look ai generated
So glad schlart is out of prison and that he's working towards a better future
Can't leave the country?  Yeah, that tends to happen when you're in prison.
LIVE STREAM YOU PLAYING HEARTS OF IRON 4
That is my hometown for you. The education system is average, however healthcare? Nope. Got UC? Too bad. take a 2-hr drive to Dallas to get your precious injections.
Are you finally uploading good videos
I can’t wait for more content like this!
I like Celsius. What an American thing for schlatty to day
Fahrenheit is better because 0F is so low it wouldn’t reach it but 0C can be reached
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU DUDE FRICKKK YEAHHHHH
Too bad you cut out the part where you admitted that Celsius was the right system in the end.
I'm glad Jambo is carrying on Schlatt's legacy even after his horrific passing. RIP Big Guy
Thank god, that reaction content was shit
Farenheit shit, smell bad, goofy numbers. I win.
💀
Shlooty is back baby!!!!!
my god finally real content
make a slop channel
I love the rants, one of my favorite videos was the airplane one
👍
He hasn’t uploaded because he’s to busy with his boyfriend
I hope he starts reacting to ifunny
Hey schlatt. We support the changes man! We happy for you big guy  Why did you knockout the queen tho
prison changed him
Science: Celsius Living: Fahrenheit
Can't believe AI "Sjchflet" is now making videos on the main account, his shorts were always bangers so I know this'll be good. Fly high king.
I have nothing but respect for your paradox sponsorship. They used to be a great company. Not gonna forgive them for making a sequel to a cult classic like Vic2and having it not resemble the original in any way that matters. Cities Skylines 2 looks baller tho, I’ll eat videos on that shit up.
Hahahahaha idiots hahahahaha farenhitttt -7777
3 hours ago.
Schlartificial Intelligence is so helpful for honouring the man himself
On Monday the jokes won’t stop
There are Two Things "Schlatt" Can Never Run out of, Money and Bodies
Well this is kinda awkward, my video is now outdated even after I uploaded it today 😅
RIP WE WILL MISS YOU😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🕊️😊
4:01 LMFAOOOO NO WAY THAT URBANIST DRAMA ENDED UP IN A JSCHLATT VIDEO 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Can we get a cheeky weekly slap.
i dont hate fahrenheit because its fucking stupid, i hate it because gabriel fahrenheit was born in a city that i hate with my whole heart
can u drunk drive again
As an American who is actively trying to use the metric system more often...           FUCK CELSIUS
Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius and 32 degrees Fahrenheit. snow. i case my rest.
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO
I feel like this will be another 1999…
I loved your content but very much fell off the reaction video tree a long time ago. Happy to see you uploading again tho Mr. Jordan Schlatt
Welcome back Shat!
thats actualy very good the reacts are great but you can make better content
What it is hoe Wassup Every good girl Need a little thug Every black boy Needs some love If you put it down imma pick it up
NOOOOOOOOOO
nothing better than seeing an american using the "i dont care that water boils at 100º Cand freezes at 0" like Farenheit doesnt work exactly like that but has way more range so is way more annoying to use xD
"What are you, water?" Yes, and Fahrenheit makes no sense, water freezes at 32° and boils at 212°, like why did they just pull numbers out of their ass for no reason, with Celsius water freezes at 0° and boils at 100° and Fahrenheits numbers for water makes no sense like "the interval between the two being divided into 180 equal parts" like why are you basing a number off a random ass number. What a perfectly stupid argument to xreate with Jschlatt AI, It's scary how accurate it's becoming and how it's opinions can piss me off the same way, RIP Jschlatt 🕊🕊🕊
NNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Just wanna let you know that I love when you make the content that makes you happy. Cheers to more great content!
Kelvin is best.
Finally "schlatt" is back
NO MORE REACTION VIDEOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!W
If he did a 7 days to die stream it would be pretty cool
no
Celsius is good for International communication and ferinhight is good for how the temperature feels like! See the answer in progress vid on it.
Dick size can change too 😇

How was your time on the inside big guy?
Rip schlatt
schlatt is a based farenheit enjoyer?????
Not hating, but I'm really pleased the tiktok reaction era is over, I was a fan originally for the old content and I'm glad to see a return to it
Oh wow...  ... you took an entire year just to change your underwear, Schlutt?
Love the plethora of subscriber plaques making it look like Christmas back there
YEEEEE FINALLY
Hey nice to see Trevor again, was a big Creatures then CowChop fan.
Splendid
I don't like the fast paced editing. It doesn't feel like a "Schlatt" video, it's more similar to minecraft letsplayers.
the ufo???
So glad you're back to this excellent content Schlatt. Me and my girlfriend broke up today and it's been tough, definitely needed this bit of light.
The evidence will be there soon, “schatt”. See you in court. RIP 1999🙏.
Yo this change is very good and I am very excited to watch some good non slop content
THANK GOD ITS OVER
WHOOOO, NEW ARC BABYYY!!  _manifesto when_
welcome back from prison
I'm so excited to see schllatt scream for 72 hours straight
Hell yah Schlatt don’t let these metric nazis conflate celsius with centimeters.
Thank god the tiktoks are over ;-;
Rank chochlate
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thank god! I hated the tiktok reaction videos tbh
Noooooooooo also 69K likes
2 day schlatt 2 days
"Schlatt" broke out?
Welcome back, Big Man.
YEEEEAAAAAAAAHHAHHHHAHAHAHAHAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!! I've HATED the reaction video trend! Thank goodness we've got the old Schlatt back.
Hey I’m glad to have you loosers !!! You guys make my loser lonely days better 😂
Why are you a furry?
Than you for telling us and warning us stay happy sir
Jo schlatt when you get to Germany can you please repeat some stuff you didn't do in the UK? I'm from Germany and would really appreciate that.
TREVOR FROM COWCHOP
Oh boy New era of jschlatt I cant wait for more. A shame that he died tho Rest in peace jschlattLIVE I'm taking jambo
We love you schlatt, views are about quality over quantity. Glad to see the streams again!
glad schlatts back from prison THEY CANT PROVE WHAT HAPPENED IN 99
This was my favorite series
Can we make it stay at 69 thousand likes?
Ok
Well FUCK
Schlatt saying how fahrenheit is superior to celsius. But we all know kelvin is the one true temperature measurement
Ok
F is way better for relevant earthly temperatures, like 0-100 degrees is pretty normal temp range for most places. ya water boils at 100 C, cool that seems good for science and cooking maybe.
Good job on finally getting out of prison "Schlatt"! I knew you could do it 👏
thank god "schlatt" is back from prison!🙏🏻
Valid, we want to see you have fun most of all big guy! So have fun! 💪
Glad to see big man’s back from prison
did he have a break up with the “what would you do if i” guy 😕😕
It’s a real shame that they caught you for what you did back in 99 but it’s pretty good that jambos uploading for you
R.I.P schlatt he died in prison, this is a deepfake
Damn it seems like the big man is still here thanks for posting this Jambo and rest easy big man
Oh thank god, I’m so glad Schlatt is going to be doing stuff he’s happy with. The tiktok videos were great but I could tell it wasn’t fun anymore. The vibes were off. Excited for a new chapter :)
Thank god there won’t be more tic tac react bs
69k likes. Nice.
WHY DO I NEVER GET STREAMING NOTIFICATIONS?!?!?!
Where is he streaming from???
WOOOOO HELL YEAH BABYYYYY
0:12 what’s that Roblox game called I’m asking for a friend
I thought he was talking about a different paradox
DOWN WITH SLOP DOWN WITH SLOP  DOWN WITH SLOP
5:55 “schlatt” has attempted to make a “joke” about being curved to the left although the only thing “schlatt” doesnt use his left hand for is “jerking off”
I hate reaction videos more then anything
R.I.P schlatt. He lived for so long but the allegations caught up and he was such a good youtuber
i cant wait for russian city skylines
The NJB tweet LMAO
Thank Shlagg
My measurement system is the opposite. I use Celsius, but my measurements are in Feet and Inches and all that. It's dope to see someone who thinks the same.
thank god. i fucking hated the tiktok vids
he got locked up for drunk driving 😢
Fly high schlatt,well miss you.And thank you Jambo for posting this ❤
Ai has really gotten far!! Rip schlatt❤❤
The dude that sent you all the candy with those Wii games is probably throwing a celebration rn. Schlatt is back!
How much did the bail cost?
Shart is super funny and I hate his reactions videos
YIPPEEEEE
HE HAS CHANGED IN PRISON!
brother your fucking freezing point is at 30 fucking 2 degrees, meanwhile eu has it at 0 🤓
Jambo really doing God's work
So, nobody's gonna tell him tha F° is also the difference between water boiling and freezing, but devided by 180?
fly high big guy.. gone but not forgotten 💔🕯️🦅
Yes gaming
I did not know ghost can still stream city sky lines
Schlatt I know you get so many comments from so many viewers, but I've been watching you for years now and I know whatever you choose to make content on, it'll be great. I think you don't give yourself enough credit. Yeah, to you it just seems like you're repeating the same process over and over just to make money, but to someone like me who just checks in on your channel once every few months because I know you're a guy who's probably not all that different from someone like me, you love funny shit, sandbox games, talking trash over the internet, and making jokes that have a subtle deep negative connotation to them that isn't always obvious at first, the content you upload is going to make me laugh regardless of what it is. The worst thing you can do is not upload. There could be another million-dollar idea around the corner that you wouldn't think would work, but Schlatt that's why you're a great creator. You can take boring concepts like reaction videos and make them just infectious to watch and share. Give yourself more credit man, you are a legitimate comedian and an artist and have been for several years. You have the power to take any boring idea and add that hilarious schlatt spin on it. I can't wait to see what you do man, hopefully I'll be around to see it.

Schlatt's attention span go uppp
YAY! TikTok reactions have gotten real old, just in general.
As I saw within the garbage hole that’s YouTube: Fahrenheit is how people feel. Kelvin is how molecules feel. And Celsius is how water feels.
Can you at least like, credit the people ?
I had to restart this video 3 times cuz I was distracted by the cats.
Do a colab with gamersups
kid named things
WHERE DID YOU POST THIS (The stream)
If only a certain female canine long range operator would do variety content like this🤔
Schlatt: Celcius is so stupid, is based on tens!
How in the hell could schlatt lose all his money he owns like 20 channels.
Im so glad schlatty patty is back to tickle my pickle🤤🤤
MISSED YOU SO MUCH SCHLADDY DADDY
Fly high big guy o7
Now, granted, I liked the reaction videos, but also, FINALLY
thank god the tiktok era is over. i'll be honest i have not watched a schlatt video in so long i forgot when i last watched one
you should finish tribute to ok computer
Glad to see you back on the anniversary of your United Kingdom vacation where nothing happened and everyone lived.
I hate that he still hasnt addressed time to smile
Why does he sound like that jshlatt AI   Ai these days is crazy
I miss weird wii games, keyboard abuse and the child neglect/endangerment. F.
I can't imagine calling Schlatt's city  "Sus FranDicksco" 💀
I cant believe, after everything we've lost this year that I have to remember the saddest one of them all 😭. RIP Smut, see you on the other side big guy 🕊️🕊️
at the very least its not pyrocinical slop
Don’t care if people don’t like it, this is what I’ve been waiting for
A TRIBUTE TO OK COMPUTER CONTINUES WHEN???
Jambo
Oh he's still dead
More OpenTTD return to your roots
I appreciate schlatt for cutting the video every 3 nanoseconds for our stupidly short attention spans
I can finally not worry sayin that i watch jschlatt
bro obviously the system you grew up with makes more sense
Fly high bro 😞 we will all miss you. 🕊️🕊️🕊️
cant wait to submit traffic signs to your subreddit
It's hard to animate AI generated Schlatt videos, that's why the output is so low.
I will die if i see another funny tiktok reaction video from you
this one time I met schlagt and I told him I didn’t understand farenheit so he flayed me
ok
wtf is a Heating measurement named ”Kelvin“
If your depressed you should go out into nature and take a week off or something. Take care of yourself man, stop self destructing.
Took me a quarter of the video to realize schlatt and martincitopants were held hostage on the same crane. Name a better collab that wasn't really a collab. I'll wait.
Am I the only person who didnt know mr. Krabs first name?
No tiktok? Back to prison you go!
I want to fly like an Schagle, to the sea, Fly like an Schagle Let my Schpirit carry me…
fuck yeah. Finally.
ok but when are you uploading more vlogs
thanks jambo, we miss schlatt too.. ❤🕊
Glad to see “Schlatt” back with some quality content
when did he stream this im so confused
Admit you are Time to Smile now.
love the news, glad to see streams are back but had to dislike cuz youre badmouthing celsius
water freezes at 0 and boils at 100. how else are you supposed to base your temp rate?
LETS GO
He didnt Milk swaggersouls dry yet
Leichter Panzerspähnwagen
Respectfully, Schlatt, when will we be properly introduced to your little demon-looking cat known as Durnt Soup?
Rest in peace. Ill miss you big guy
Schlatt is so right about the Fahrenheit v Celsius argument. 99% of the time when we talk about temperatures, we are talking about them in relationship to humans existing in those temps. And well what do you know, we have a 0-100 scale that pertty much matches up perfectly to the range of temps that humans can survive.
So glad that they finally let “Schlatt” out of prison
YOU KNOW ITS BAD WHEN HE MAKES A VIDEO LIKE THIS
jschlattlive don’t have the least original comments section of all time challenge (IMPOSSIBLE)
Truly thank you Jambo and whatever the other guys called, for uploading one last video of the big guy. Rest in piece jhlatt, hop you enjoy yourself in hell, see you soon
Yo rank candy
Good for you Schlatt. I don't smile anymore either. Tiktok is the embodiment of a computer virus designed to use blue light of your phone, to give you a cancerous case of brain rot. That is to say, you become more and more manic the longer you use TikTok.
Listen, Celsius makes more sense. Yes you do boil at 100°c and yes you do freeze at below 0°c
rip schllatttlaltat
return of the king baby
yay shlart hi
we support you schlatt do what u need
Rest in pieces shat
A tribute to Minecraft 2
Awesome
It ain’t city skylines without media share., autotune, and funny mic.
ima touch your special place lil nigga
jshlarch rest in PEACE BRUTHA SPREAD LOVE NOT HaTe BROTHA
(:
It would be nice if you keep making the meme reactions on the second channel or smth, its just much better to watch a compilation of memes in your video with your reaction than search the internet for good memes. I guess I like the sense of humor and if it is already compiled in one vid I don't have to find them myself and rather watch your reaction to the compilation. Also these vids are the only thing keeping the subreddit alive and the subreddit is one of my few meme sources, don't want it to just die
I'm so glad your moving away from reactions, it was good to eat and watch, but I hate it.
the random shoutout to Tokyo lens threw me off
Fucking finally I hated the TikTok videos I'm ngl💀 the first one was alright but the viewer submitted reaction ones were so much better
I bet getting used to the real world after being in prison for so long has gotta be one hell of a transition
can you make it into a 30 second tiktok
shlat is Alive?
Fahrenheit is way better for weather. 0 is really cold, 100 is really hot, and there is 😢plenty of gradient to know if the weather is great/good/meh/bad/kill me. Celsius is better for everything else, but the big F wins on weather.
the random shoutout to Tokyo lens threw me off
Gonna miss the reaction vids genuinely enjoyed them
Is like Lakeland, Florida
okay
Glad to see "Schlatt" is back from the grave, we can never get rid of the "funny mic".
I can't believe his family found these old videos to post. Rest in peace big guy...you will be missed ❤️
We’re free
Schlatt died?!
Why does schlcock look more horizontal than usual
hm, finally schlatt can go back to what he does the best at..  its "crime"
Cheeto
He's in WITSEC because of what happened in 1992, and of course those whacky little incidents in Bulgaria last year.
Are you not gonna address the time to smile channel?????
Schwartz any tips for prison?
*OH HI YOU!*
i’m so glad you’re switching from tiktok reactions to gaming again. was getting tired of them. schlatt never fails to come inside me
Oh it just turns into a city skylines video lol
Oh jcsclit I’ll love you even tho that incident in 99 changed the course of the universe for ever
On a real note I have no idea why Fahrenheit is even used or better than Celsius. I'm from the UK and everyone uses Celsius in most other countries I've been to as well. It's just simple: 100 degrees is water boiling point and 0 is water freezing point. What's the appeal for Fahrenheit? Genuinely asking lol
Let's go. Schlatts back
omg they let "jschlatt" out of his cell for this one that's crazyyy
shit like this is why i like schlatt. i didn't watch the tiktok shit because i just didn't enjoy it all that much, but it didn't make me hate him. thanks for being real, man, i'll be sure to awkwardly harass you if i ever see you in public.
The hashtags in the fake tweets always crack me up
Schlat, you can not run out of money if you rob enough banks. So it, big guy
its like i can still hear his voice.. miss you big guy 🙏 rest in paradise buddy 🕊🕊
The beginning had me dead💀💀💀😊
It’s been a year since the Scotland Incident
LMAO
Reactions gotta go, we missed you jonathan
Cheers big fella
Fahrenheit is for how hot humans feel, Celsius is for how hot water feels, and kelvin is for how hot atoms feel.  Nuff said
who
At 32° it all happens, not at 0
Thank you Schlatt, was genuinely getting so tired of them
He’s back!
i’m so excited to have some variety starting bro
I noticed his latest TikTok reaction video said “finale” in the title for a solid 3 minutes and then he removed it
Your comment section might suck and be full of children ignoring their homework but one day they'll try and get a little heart just like me rn
let's gooooooo
Today is a good day
Gotta love how Schlatt finds a city where the living conditions are ruined, and out of the goodness of his heart, he finishes the job. What a guy.
You lost an arguement with yourself. And then now you are saying you are right. Hypocrisy
Honestly bro I just assumed you didn't like what you vere doing anymore and quit and that's all good it's your channel do what you want with it
Grilled Cheese
I don’t think he was back from prison I think he broke out
"Not enough evidence", mhm sure schlatt
Even though I like the tik tok series I’m glad he’ll still do fan submissions. Those are funny as hell
i probably got the notification for you going live and assumed it was somehow bait from whoever might think to do that
Bless Your Perfection  Praise the true creators 🙌
YES IM SO EXCITED FPR THE RANKING
farenheit superiority
I liked this for the argument of Celsius vs Fahrenheit because he is right
rip shrapnel it wasnt your fault
Honestly kinda glad reaction vids are done, tic toc and teirlist vids are the most boring things I’ve seen from schlatt
🎉Happy Birthday Schlattmeister 🎉
They only let the real guys, the best guys, go on a crane to play skylines streamed at 240p
Rip Schlatt, shoutout to his family
Review crystal meth
rest in peace big guy miss you everyday 💔💔
This vid almost makes me want to forgive him for taking my arms and legs and leaving me as a stub after i almost bled out and died from the severe trauma. I am typing this with my many appendages attached to my arm and leg stubs. I am now fulfilling my long sought-after dream of becoming an octupus, all because of this wonderful man. Thank you schlatt.
Did you get bailed out or did you escape from prison and they’re still looking for you 😂😮
W
rip
Cmon schlatt be honest, we have the evidence, we just can't find you, finding short people is very difficult in a world not built for them
“Schlatt” should do a ranking of all of his tiktok reaction videos
Glad to see more rankings! Always loved :(
Fuck slatt far N heat is for protestants
Jokes on you I don't wanna pretend I have friends I just don't have any friends. Why would I pretend I have friends if I like having no friends... its zero pressure to not piss them off now it's perfect
LETS GET THIS TO THE MOST VEIWS SO HE CAN HAVE FUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
Another theory is Schlatt is getting out of the reaction videos because of all the drama & criticism lately with react content. Kids watch that stuff.   Sophisticated folks watch drunk driving game content loaded with cursing 😂
Ngl I'm so happy he stopped making tik Tok reactions
Schlatt has been freed from tiktok HQ! Very glorious!
"They dont have enough evidence for that" i have proof from 99 dont think im not coming for you shat or however tf you say your name. im coming for you.
Rest in piece, Schlagg. You shall be missed 🕊️🕊️🕊️
thank god this era is over i hate reaction videos
OMG THE BIG GUY IS ALIVE
Cool bro
sometimes i can still hear his voice
‘Schlatt’ you are incorrect. Celsius is better and Fahrenheit is terrible. That’s it.
farenheit makes more sense because it was meant for non-scientific situations. Celsius was designed for science
Wait Schlatt's human?
Thank god
Simplicity and Scientific Consistency: Celsius, also known as the Centigrade scale, is based on a logical and straightforward scientific foundation. It defines the freezing point of water at 0 degrees Celsius and the boiling point at 100 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. This scale is aligned with the fundamental properties of water, which makes it easy to understand and use in scientific contexts. Fahrenheit, on the other hand, lacks this scientific consistency, as its zero point (-40 °F) has no direct physical significance.  Global Standard: Celsius is the standard unit of temperature used in most parts of the world, including all scientific communities, international organizations, and the International System of Units (SI). This global standardization simplifies communication and ensures consistency in scientific research, weather forecasting, and international trade.  Intuitive Temperature Range: Celsius offers a temperature scale that is more intuitive for everyday purposes. In Celsius, temperatures below 0°C are considered cold, while temperatures above 20°C are generally considered comfortable or warm. This makes it easier for people to relate to and plan for daily activities.  Conversion and Compatibility: Celsius is easier to convert to Kelvin (the absolute temperature scale used in scientific research) because the Kelvin scale is directly related to Celsius (0 K = -273.15°C). This simplifies calculations in scientific experiments. Fahrenheit, with its non-linear conversion to Kelvin, complicates such conversions.  Reduced Confusion: The use of Celsius reduces confusion when comparing temperatures across different countries and regions. Travelers and scientists can communicate temperature values more effectively, as they are using the same temperature scale.  Energy Efficiency: Celsius is also more practical when discussing energy efficiency. For example, in weather forecasting, it is easier to convey the concept of a 10-degree temperature drop in Celsius than in Fahrenheit, which may require conversion and is less intuitive.  In summary, Celsius offers a more scientifically consistent, globally accepted, and intuitive temperature scale that simplifies communication and calculations in various fields, including science, industry, and daily life. Its widespread use contributes to its superiority over Fahrenheit in many practical applications.
Shlatt finally got bailed out of prison 🙏
No more schlatt slop yippeee!
Let's fucking GOOOOO. can't wait to see the upcoming content. Hype
I can't believe he's actually gone. RIP 🪦
The lump is now called the jshlump
kinda sucks that no more reaction videos because your reactions are some of the best, but all of your other kinds of videos are great too!
So glad schlatt is finished with the reaction tiktok videos, it was getting repetitive and people kept encouraging it even though his gaming content is way better and you can tell he just likes it more. I hope he keeps doing what he loves more often
Rip shat😭😭😭
FINALLY!!! I have completely stopped watching your videos because I hate the tiktok reaction videos. Can't wait for more real videos
Schallt became RTGame
They teach him good things in prison
Only fans when
i feel like you're too concerned with the content "genre" you make without taking into account that we could be entertained by you gardening or washing dishes.
1:55 American learns that most of the worlds population use metric measurements, and Celsius
God... I told myself I wouldn't cry. Fuck. Fly high Johnathan😪❤‍🩹🕊 You will be missed, Big Guy.
You look like Pedro Pascal with that haircut
I thought your plan was the five-year plan😂
HAPPY EARLY BIRTHDAY BY THE WAY🎈🎈🎈🎉🎉🎉🎊🎊🎊
Thank God
I completely agree that the reactions of tik toks are enough, but the fan made presentations or weird videos of their rooms are funny
thank you for giving us this last message of his. may jscat and all the other passengers aboard malaysian #17 RIP ❤️🕊️
is jschlatt dead
Fly high ‘schlatt’, you will be missed❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

This the 50th time this mf has changed something
Mr schlaaty  shlat. Post what you want that makes you happy brother. Tbh you could post anything and your community will eat that shit up. Seeing you happy with the content you post is best. Keep up the work big man. Love to see more weekly slaps too.
schlatt thumbnail teirlist when?
Rest in peace Sprite. You will be missed 🙏🕊
RIP Johnathan Schlatt I can almost still hear him
AI has gotten so good, it’s almost impossible to tell that this isn’t the real schlatt. Fly high schlatt, we all miss you 🕊️❤
finally, jschlatt youtube video content
RIP Schlatt, gone but not forgotten.  If only he hadn't got into that shootout over petty cash :(
Thank god dude it got pld very quick
Welcome back from prison schatt 🫶🫶🫶
YEY HE IS BACK! Happy to see you man.
I’m unbelievably happy. Glad to have you back, big guy.
Welcome to toenails
Wow. Entire Youtube career ending like that?? Oof. Rip
ballz
“schlatts” finally dead
Thanks BIG guy looking forward to new content!
Thank god you’re changing for the better. I shrugged off the first tik tok reaction video, but as they kept coming, I lost hope. Glad to have you back, man. Can’t wait to see what you do next
Thats so funny i was coming to this channel for your tiktok reaction videos. Ill go sit on a cannon like a pencil topper and wait
RANKINGS WWWWWW
Schnott is gonna end up rating toenails next video I promise you he's just lying
There are two accepted international measurement systems; One for the country that has had men walk on the moon, and one for all the other countries. Hope this clears things up.
YES FINALLY I CAN START WATCHING YOU AGAIN
RIP big guy❤️ drunk crashing really takes the good ones.
here you go schaltt, just for the memes!  Comparing the programming languages C and Fortran (often abbreviated as "F") can be a complex task, as their strengths and weaknesses depend on the context and specific use cases. However, one can argue that C is generally better than Fortran in many modern software development scenarios due to its versatility, extensive libraries, and broader industry support.  1. Versatility:    C is a general-purpose programming language, while Fortran was originally designed for scientific and numerical computations. This means C can be used for a wider range of applications beyond scientific computing. Whether you're developing operating systems, embedded systems, desktop applications, or even web services, C offers more flexibility and adaptability.  2. Libraries and Ecosystem:    C has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that cover almost every aspect of software development. Whether you need to work with graphics, databases, networking, or any other domain, you can find well-maintained C libraries to help you. Fortran's library ecosystem, while strong in numerical computing, may be limited when it comes to other application domains.  3. Portability:    C has been standardized through the ISO/IEC C standard, ensuring a high level of portability across different platforms and compilers. This portability is crucial for software that needs to run on various hardware and operating systems. Fortran, on the other hand, may have some portability issues, especially when moving between different compilers.  4. Industry Support:    C is widely adopted across various industries, including finance, telecommunications, aerospace, and gaming. This broad industry support means that C developers have access to a vast community of professionals, resources, and tools. Fortran's usage is more concentrated in scientific and high-performance computing fields, which may limit the resources available for non-specialized applications.  5. Modern Features:    C has evolved over the years, introducing modern features like dynamic memory allocation, support for object-oriented programming, and a rich set of data types. These features make C code more maintainable and adaptable to modern software development practices. Fortran, although it has been updated, may lack some of these modern features.  6. Interoperability:    C can easily interface with other programming languages like C++, Python, and Java. This interoperability is essential for building complex software systems that leverage multiple languages and libraries. Fortran's ability to interoperate with other languages may be more limited.  While Fortran excels in specific areas like numerical computation and scientific simulations, C's versatility and extensive ecosystem make it a better choice in many contemporary software development contexts. The choice between C and Fortran ultimately depends on the specific requirements of a project, but for general-purpose software development, C often offers more advantages.
RIP Jschlatt, thank you for posting this Jambo💔🕊
Im so happy you finally got out of jail
Fucking finally, those tiktok reactions got old QUICK
holy shit you’re making content again
2:03 I've never heard a more correct opinion in my life.
Jebediah Schlatt, as an honest comment:  I do not fucking care what the fuck you do. As long as your mental health is where you want it to be and even better than that.  I don’t care what you post and publish, I’ll watch it regardless, I watch it because you are in it. That’s the reason I’m here, I’m here to see you play games, rant, get angry, swear and make me laugh.  The reactions were funny, but I might as well watch meme compilations and get the same viewing pleasure.  I just wanted to say thank you for your videos and what you do for many, many people online.
Yay old shlatt is back?
"Fahrenheit just makes more sense" 32 degrees is freezing. in celsius 0 degrees is freezing
HELL YA! cant wait jschlatt
RIP Big Guy😔
Dude. Make a channel for money-making. And another channel for fun. (jshlattLIVE -> theweeklyslap) (also, invest your excess, dum dum)
I can't believe this is real, throughout these years you were a huge inspiration to me and thousands of others. Thank you for everything shit🕊
i really miss him. life has been so empty without jebediah. RIP 1990 - 2003
well atleast i dont have to be afraid to call the ambulance
Ur dum
RIP Schlot
Thank god "Schlatt" is back from prison
i can’t believe he’s gone, 😢 he will be missed. fly high schlatt 🕊️❤️
Hi schatt
YESSIR
4:02 HAHAHA NJB catching strays even outside of urbanist circles
i agree with the celsius thing
FUCK YEAH
WE BACK BABY WOOOOOO
Schlatt needs a new comment section.
sclit, we thought you died, so unfortunate that you didnt, welcome back
I cant believe “schlingus” posted a new YouTube video
It great that the prison still lets him stream even though he did those things to those people in 99
Don't we all just love when Schlatt's not in prison.
he is building Dubai from scratch.
Thank you Jschlutt for working hard all these years you can rest now you will be missed fly high ❤️🕊️
so sad. i wish i couldve watched shlatt while he was still alive
Its a cruel reminder of what once was.. these ai videos are too real. Rest in piece Jschlatt.
Wow ai is so realistic in this day and age
Finally bro, I’m so fucking sick of all the god damn tik toks
Words cannot describe, how sad I am about the news that Schlatt died... First the Queen, and now Schlatt himself... Gosh this hits hard. I will miss him, especially his Tier List Videos, or Gameplay videos. There won't be another person like him on the youtube/twitch. May his soul rest in peace, a man with potential gone too soon 🕊
Super excited for streams to come back! I can’t wait to finally be able to join a stream ‼️‼️‼️
Im so confused. Could whoever is posting these canned vids please do so more regularly? It helps make it seem like he's not gone. Its gonna be so sad when the backlog runs out.
Damn 3 days before it also
Rest in peace schlott, we hope that drunk driver gets what he deserves 💔🕊
So whens parole ending, big man?
I loved your content schlatt. rest easy in heaven big guy😢
Would you do a YLYL with JimmyHere?
Just do meth while reacting to the tik toks
YEAH
do Tampere next
This vid is a great birthday present :3 Keep doing what you enjoy schlatt!!
just rewatching his old videos for a laugh... RIP jschlatt fly high 🕊
Wait is he dead?!
Not 10 seconds into the video I think about the day my dog got lost in South Carolina when this guy nicknamed Gay Schläg wanted to pet him. I left to Shit in my car and I only found his tail🫡. This bastard ate my fish
fly high shlagg
oh, he's back. That's cool. Hey, Schlatt.
as a fahrenheit user fahrenheit is stupid. 0 being freeze makes the most sense
i hate that he's gone, we all miss him so much♥️. Rest In Peace Jonathan Schlatt
okay 👍
Why is there just an AI running the channel now? Is Schlatt okay?
fucking finally
Rip schlatt died so young😢
YESSS I KEEP SAYING THIS, we Americans need to concede and say the fact that metric is better than our imperial system, but FUCK CELSIUS OUR SHIT IS BETTER!!
WOOHOO!! Glad to see the schlattmer back on his janky shit.  I’m also glad you’re confident enough in your content to not sell yourself for quality content, I worry sometimes when people find grand success in one genre that they don’t necessarily favor. Looking forward to more funny moments.
This type of quality isn't like Schlatt, the AI must be becoming better, RIP Schonking🕊
Huge respect to Jambo for crawling into schlatts body and making us think he's still with us 😢😢😢
yay
POG
BRO I LOVE RANTSAND THE OLD VIDEO ESSAYS
damn what an incredible post-mortem finale from schlort! R.I.P schlamn fly high 🙏🏻🕊💀🪦
The video is to short and there is to many cuts i watched the stream and it was awsome the video just feels to fast
Rip Jambo jnat deaf
no worries schlatt, i'll watch the tiktok reactions if you ever upload them. if you need the money, i'll be happy to watch them to help get more bangers from you. big ups big guy.
It’s so sad 💔 it’s almost like I can still here him 🕊️ RIP “jschit”
Remember "did jshlatt win"?  Me too
Here's hoping these changes bring a happier schlatt
honestly, as long as he's happy with what he's doing, im happy to watch :)
Rest in piece schlatt🕊️ i wish he was still here, now he is in.....🕊️
2:10 Fuck yeah
But as an American 🇺🇸 Celsius makes more sense, Freezing at 0° Melting at 100°. Correct me if I'm wrong. Fahrenheit doesn't really make sense but I use both the Metric & the Imperial System because millions of people use each one every day. I'm more used to using Imperial but more people use Metric, it's more simple but at the end of the day it's just numbers.
Rest in peace shat fly high 😔🕊
I get struck with terror whenever Johnatan Jshlatt uploads or goes live
The AI is getting really good its like he's here, RIP Schortle💔🕊
Man, these deep fakes and ai voices are getting better and better😔… Fly high Schlatt, you’ll be missed.😭 🕊❤
I'll miss him, rest in power ✊️😥
oh yeah about that I'm banned on Reddit
Rip
The Fahrenheit take has got to be one of his biggest Ls
WE ARE SO BACK
YES YES YES! LITTERALY ANYTHING ELSE!
You’re going to jail for the things you did?
Genuinely I am SO excited for this new era. I started watching your content in around December, so I'm really excited for the streams and the commentary videos!
He even made a video to make us feel better about his passing. Rest in peace king ❤
mate what you mean where in prison what the fuck missed me
DUDE MAKE THAT REAL ACTUAL STUFF. CONTENT IS LIKE A SANDWICH AND LATELY U BEEN MAKIN OSCAR MEYERS BOLOGNA BS.
he came back from Big Prison W
I’m so upset that “Schlut” has passed away and crossed the rainbow bridge. Rest in peace bro🙏 Seriously, I’m glad you’re doing more things you enjoy. I liked the TikTok reaction videos, but I’m glad the viewer submissions are coming back. =]
I'm gonna thank the big guy for no more reaction videos.
Paradox: Sponsors schlatt Schlatt: builds a dick
Nice schlatt i missed your old content
“Jschlatt” has finally moved on, just like he forced those victims to do back in ‘99…
Fahrenheit is good.
Celsius makes so much more sense than Fahrenheit because...    It's Sub- **ZERO** , not Sub- Thirty-two you goddamn fungus
Loved when he ranked food. Those videos were so funny, especially when he would get go from rage to happy in two seconds. The one moments when he saw shapes he was instantly pissed off, when the next one he was happy. In my opinion, those were the peak
I can't believe the allegations are true😮😮😮
big guy posted YIPPIE
Rest in pepperonis big guy
I’m so proud of you shlatt for getting out of prison❤
Kinda ironic he died exactly one year after the Queen did, RIP either way.
I agree with schlatt on the temperature stuff, Fahrenheit is better for people as it’s like a scale of 1-100 for the warmth of a person. Celsius is better for general science and non everyday stuff. Celsius is basically asking water how it feels from 1-100
Where the fuck is the schlankets.
i thought you guys were joking but he actually died jesus, rip ig
Lotta losses this year, this one stings the most. RIP Joseph T. Schlattamier II, you will be missed.
Sclutty will always live on in our hearts. Rest in peace, big guy.
Rest in Peace big man I feel like I can here right now❤❤🫡🫡✊
Cant believe its been a year since you murdered Queen Elizabeth II
Goodbye Jschlatt, you will be missed.  Us Schlattocians, followers of Schlatt adore our Mutton-Chop-Wearing guy, and what will happen to Jambo and the other cat? 💔
RIP 🕊️🕊️
Gimme my shlanket Jshid
After a bummer ass week this is exactly what I needs, with the charges dropped due to lack of evidence we have our Big Guy back!
i cant believe bro is fucking dead
I do think it would be nice to sprinkle reaction vids in every now and then, they're always really funny, but I also definitely agree that the milking of em was getting pretty stale.
its like hes still here.. 🙏
My father was also in prison for a lil while!
It's unfortunate to hear that you arent enjoying the reaction content. I always really liked watching them, they were better when it was streamed tho. hope to see it return sometime but ill keep watching your vids anyway
I actually stopped enjoying the reaction videos and quit watching them because I'm not lonely, actually go outside, and have a woman in my life. I see this as an absolute win. I watch you because you're funny and make cool stuff, not for your wacky reactions to Tiktoks. Make stuff you're proud of and makes you happy.
W Schlaltt
Jschlatt's memory will forever live on in our hearts.. ❤️❤️❤️
I was there for the prerecorded video that Jambo streamed. It truly felt like he was still here😢
"This video is spon-"  Sponsor block: *Skipped sponsor*
I genuinely miss the live stuff with the bedrooms. It was sprcifically designed to make you go insane live
Celsius is so gay. - JShloop probably.
just as i thought shlatt sold his soul to the algorithm he comes back with this. Well done man, i'll definitely be watching
It's nice to finally see gameplay again, I love all your content but gameplay videos let you be yourself the most and that's great, keep doing what makes you happy.
Glad to see this "jshlatt" guy is redeeming himself by ending react content for a second there I thought he was going  to his old ways back in 1999
Ngl im glad to see you changing up content. I loved your old shit but goddamn the fucking reaction videos sucked ass holy shit.
He’s done with the tik toks!!!! Hope to see more rant vids.
It seems like “schlatt” is struggling with retention, tell him he doesn’t have to keep laughing every 3 seconds just like he did the one night in 99
Ok but who asked
play more truck sim sheep boy
Hey schlatt nice seeing you again glad to recatch up buddy^^
tier list is back baby
Average Schlatt w
Frick  you shat yb better
But you still haven’t seen all of the tiktoks
I'm so excited for more CS2 videos... Cities: skylines 2 that is.
Will schlatt actually rank the tiktok then?
your memory will truly live on schlatt. RIP 💔💔
trevor is cooler than you and has more swag
I miss schlatt. Thank god his estate posted this. Rip
R.I.P it's like ur still here... Man i miss u 😢
Rip shlagg
I went to the comments before the vid started, and I genuinely thought he died.
silly shlagg, 100 boils water and 0 freezes water so its just normal, foolish American.
Jambo puppeteering Schlatt’s lifeless corpse to upload this video is so wholesome.
It’s hard to believe that Schloot has already gone… fly high 🕊️
Can I cause a 9/11 in this game and record it, then upload it to the Internet
0°C for water freezing and 100 for boiling is obviously better, why does fahrenheit even exist
Schaltt[rip] spend literally over 150k on a monkey statute with huge balls of course he needed to grind YouTube to make his money back, but now I know  5 tic tok videos = 1 monkey ball statute.
rest in peace "schlatt" you will be missed average sized guy 🙏<3
No reactions is fine…. ;(
Rest in piece buddy
Fly high big guy we all miss you 🕊️❤
rest in peace
“Things are about to change” was also what he told those poor people before he committed those heinous acts in 1999.
what do you f*cking mean, you are 70% water
All the reaction videos were hella entertaining and amazing background noise  Who am I kidding this nigga Schlatt makes anything funny
Yeah I’m ready for something new on the channel, the reaction stuff got kinda boring.
Its like he's still here 🙏🙏 (but on a real note its good to know you're turning towards content you would be more pleased with, love ya big guy)
Celcius makes way fucking more sense
Fly high Schlatt, We all miss you so much there's not a day that goes by where I don't think about you. RIP KING.
ah yes the Fahrenheit where 0C +0C = C but 32F + 32F = 64 💀💀💀💀                             joke btw
Play fort  nite 🥺🥺
Celsius makes so much more sense for engineering. For skin feel, yeah fahrenheit is best, but for engineering I'd rather abolish the imperial system. It's too much work for the same exact answer.
Fahrenheit feels better because it’s more precise than Celsius. The increments between the degrees are smaller, even if it’s only by a little bit.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I'm so excited for more content that you enjoy making!!! :D
You wasted so much time you fool
Rest in peace "schlatt" you'll be remembered 😔🫡
We will miss you big guy. Thoughts and prayers for you Jambo. Thank you so much for uploading this. Fly high Big Guy fly high🕊️🕊️🕊️
If you are going to do more gaming , please do it like you used to (no face cam and less editing)
Next gamer supps flavor will be "Body of schlatt" Rest in peace Big Guy God bless! 🙏
I've been begging for non-garbage content for ages now
Not many addicts have the balls to admit their addiction and actually take action….and you’ve done it with ease by straight up saying “no more TikToks reaction videos”.   So Inspirational my dude 🫡 😂
I’m so glad “Schlatt” came back to bring us happiness. We all know, it’s time to smile. 😊
W
What’s going on Fitz! Long time no see!
Dude. You made me so angry about the  Fahrenheit thing. In celsia 100 = boil 0 = freeze. Its just so easier.
I like how you made what was by all accounts a scam city, built all the infrastructure just to blow it up, and still came out with three and a half million dollars
Can’t believe that 1999 finally caught up to him, rest in peace Schlatt
He already ran out of money ?

Fuck yes. Honestly schlatt Idc what you upload just keep doing you. Always good to just see ur content boss. Keep it up big man 😉
the legend has returned!
im very upset. fly high jshit 🙏
RIP sklart you will be missed
thank god i fucking hated the reacts
Fr it still confuses me I’ve been here my hole life
Bro just do you man
tell me how farenheit makes more sense when celcius literally has the waters freezing and boiling point at 0 and 100 degrees. and its comfort temperature is 20 on the dot. tf u mean farenheit is better??? the us is just built up by a whole bunch of people in denial knowing that everyting is better in the outside world. 😂😂😂
Normally I’m against using AI to resurrect people but I miss Schlatt so much that I’ll let this slide
Woooooo “Schlatt’s” case was dropped because the witnesses came up missing. Great work Shlog!
shush lil bro
My fight for Celcius is that Fahrenheit is dumb when you're trying to find out what temperature ice freezes. I know if I see 0°C on the thermostat then there might be frost outside. But nah, Fahrenheit is some odd number like 36, what genius thought of that
Nice job
It’s TimeToThink 😀
rest in peace shat, i can still hear his voice…
i love how AI has come so far in such a short time... but it's just not the same... R.I.P. Schlong you will be missed 🙏🙏
Top 5 YouTuber glad you’ve returned from the money pit.
I’m the OPPOSITE. Measure in pounds and ounces, inches and yards mmmm yes, but Celsius is soooo much better. 0 for freezing, 100 for boiling. Yum and yum.
Its really sad to hear he died so young, rest in peace, shlom.🕊️🕊️🕊️
yeah you're so right Celsius is so stupid water freezes at 0 and boils at 100 where the much more simple and easy where water freezes at 32 and boils at 212. its just makes so much more sense you're right.
rest in peace schlong. ill miss you.
His big update is on the anniversary of that old battle axes death
YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
This man always makes a video like every year
I a Brit so your a bad person
Its ok Jambo.. you don’t have to post his drafts… 😔🙏 r.i.p.
Rip Ticktok Reaction Vids 😂
FINALLY I stopped watching the reaction videos cause im like if i wanted to doomscroll through tiktok i would. and i dont. but now that real schlatt is back, i can finally be content in life
Rest in peace shatt 🙏🕊️🕊️
We’re proud of your transition shilt
Finally! Actual substance worthy content! I love it. ❤️
Cat moments  0:00 Bath time 0:07 Garfield leaves 0:15 Sleep 0:35 ✨Turn✨ 2:53 Last scene of cats
Happy one year anniversary of your greatest accomplishment schlatt!🎉🎉🎉🎉
Things have changed because you uploaded the first time in ages dummy
1h
Hey shit! Glad ur back!
Goodbye jschlatt you will be missed, RIP 😔✋️♥️
I can't wait to see schlatt's happy personality again
as a german, i am really glad that schlorpp wasnt able to visit our country, who knows what kind of atrocities he would have commited judging from his criminal record
i learned that some canadians use Fahrenheit for summer and celsius for winter and that makes perfect sense to me
As someone who lived in San Francisco for most of my life, i would match rather live in Schlatticus' version then the current one
Finally after two years of straight tiktok reuploads, MORE SCHATT 💀
gimme that clout you make on this video
why are your eyebrows different from your other hair
Show the rest of the clip about how right Celsius was
4HESE COMMENTS ARE SCARY DID HE ACTUALLY DIE???
Blue Danube playing when he gets a monolith is very nice attention to detail
Alright works for me aslong as ur posting idc
I’ve agreed with the Fahrenheit vs Celsius debate since a random sleep deprived podcast as you just have more units to express temperature it’s just objectively better
hey, in farenheit 69° is peak weather, but in celcius it’s dead ppl weather
I miss you every day big guy! RIP❤❤❤
I’m actually rlly hype for his new stuff
It's almost like he's still here... RIP Jschlatt, thank you for posting this Jambo <3
Glad to see you be you again, I am finding out what that means myself. Things are about to change indeed >:)
LETS FUCKING GO NO MORE JSCHLOKS
whoever is running this account now has to fix the AI it's starting to make decisions
‘’And the plan starts with no… games’’
Rip big man
Rest in piece Schlatt, crazy how enhanced AI has gotten lately. My condolences to Jambo ...fly high big man🕊🕊
schlaat big man hear me out.....play Harts of iron 4....pleas
Neither Fahrenheit or Celsius is better than the other. It depends what you grew up with
Rip schlarrt
Yes schlatt. We are 60% water. It is one of the most vital components to our body.
"Celcius is european" is the most american thing i have ever heard
Oh god shlatt is out of prison
New schlat vid yay
Don't have enough evidence? 5 days, Schaltt. In 5 more days, you'll be a deadman.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Still waiting on that chuckle sandwich roadtrip to Enumclaw
Ngl schlatt could make a 20 minute rant about bidets and i would still watch   wait...
As long as theres more schlatt and schlatt is happy so thats a plus
NO MORE REACTION?! NOOOO!! lmao edit - oh nice
So sad this video reminds me of simpler times of when schoot was still alive, it’s a shame he was killed in that drunk driving incident 🙁
YYYYYYYYEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Jokes on you, i watch sleep deprived
YESSSSS NO MORE TIKTOKS
We need evidence, and when we obtain it, in prison, you will spend the rest of your life
Steve Jobbs called, he wants his wardrobe back
schlatt got so much money from '99 but still can't afford to record in 4k
he shall be missed rest in peace🕊🕊🕊
Is this "guy" actually dead?
Why is this guy sitting infront of the camera and talking over the cats?
We’ll miss you “schlaofjg”. Jambo is running your account smoothly, fly high 🕊️🕊️
6:02 i hate that this joke is an actual thing that happens around my area, it's so annoying            Electric company L + Skill Issue + Fuck You
WE ARE SO BACK!
The tiktok vids are no more (for now) and we cheered!
AI is insane these days
Dang guess I'll have to come back when you make another tik tok video
“Go back to primal, liver king in this shit!”-schlatt 2023
Good stuff mr schmatt
So excited to see the new content :)
Glad to see him come back to the content that made me start watching in the first place
i cant speak for everyone ofc but i know from experience from years of following you through many different kinds of content that you are entertaining no matter what you do so please do what you enjoy and the real fans will follow. and who knows, you might find something else that makes you more money than tiktok reactions (if thats even possible)
Love you, big man
Was waiting for the bait and switch but nope. Good on ya
Rest in peace 'shlagg'. You will be missed 😭😭
Thanks “jachlatt”
Monkey
This is an AI video
Looks like the big guy finally escaped Davy Jones' locker. Welcome back to the land of the living dude!
God I’m so glad Schlatt is stopping the reaction content. The earlier ones with Bedrooms and PC setups were great but it got stale so fast. I’m ready for some different content
i can watch jshit again
I am genuinely so happy to here this, ive been going back to the old minecraft videos since you made that one community post and while you may think they arent that great i nearly shat myself laughing, which is not really how i feel watching the tiktok videos. Cant wait to see where your vids go next, rest in peace Big Guy
I know it's just a bit, but seriously celsius is better
02:20 Fahrenheit is retarded, Celsius is simple n to the point, it's the same shit but instead Fahrenheit just chose a random ass starting point, makes no fucking sense. (I'm starting to see why you dropped out)
Paradox has a ton of crazy different games. From war crime simulator to cities skylines
Wow, no more tiktok reactions? Why are you even here then. All your loyal fans have been dying for more tiktok reactions and ranking. and you decide to just change things? We've been dying for you to get  back to tiktok reactions after you started making other videos. Lost a subscriber.
Fahrenheit is asking humans how hot it is, Celsius is asking water how hot it is, Kelvin is asking atoms how hot it is
Thank you so much for the memories schlatt, and thank you jambo posting this video..
Can’t believe he’s gone
Celsius is undoubtedly a superior temperature scale when compared to Fahrenheit for several compelling reasons. Firstly, Celsius is based on the metric system, which is widely used and understood across the globe, promoting international consistency in scientific and everyday temperature measurements. This makes it easier for people from different countries to communicate and comprehend temperature values. Secondly, Celsius offers a more intuitive and logical scale, with water freezing at 0°C and boiling at 100°C at standard atmospheric pressure. In contrast, Fahrenheit lacks this straightforward reference point, with water freezing at 32°F and boiling at an awkward 212°F. This convoluted scale can lead to confusion and imprecision in everyday temperature discussions. Lastly, Celsius is better suited for scientific and engineering purposes due to its compatibility with the metric system, simplifying calculations and conversions. In summary, Celsius provides a more universal, logical, and practical way to measure temperature, making it undeniably superior to the Fahrenheit scale.
I fucking loved the jackbox games videos. I'd agree the games feel old really fast, like same games, same jokes, but once in a while, 2-3 jackbox videos a year maybe? I'd love that
Thank you for bringing back the viewer submission content because that was always, always funnier than random tiktoks. I'm most excited for the random videos you put out though like I loved the one you did about brands making their logos worse over time
Please do more mid-2000's video games (gamecube? xb360 kinect?).  The Wii game series was my personal favorite series of everything you've done.
I didn’t watch the video, because I don’t care what’s in it, just by it’s name I can understand that schlatt is preparing to kill another member of British royal family  Edit: I’ve watched the video, apparently he’s gonna do that because of his unreasonable hate for Celsius.
The queen is dead you will now be using the imperial measurement system
I'm not sure if this is insensitive, but thank FUCKING GOD THERE'S NO MORE REACTIONS. like I was FUCKING STARVED of actual schlatt content for SO LONG
Your thumbnails literally made the troll face becoming sad meme.
🎵 "In the arms of the angles..."🎶  😢We miss your quick wit in all of its superior complex angles!
Shlartts channel will never be the same without him rip
I can't wait for his next upload to be a TikTok reaction video 😂
YES!! Not just an announcement video but also some content right afterwards. Is this a first time for youtube? Nonetheless I love it
who is this guy
Soda tier list please
I've really missed this content like reactions was good but this is just so you yk
Cool.
kelvin on top
i do not give a shit if an american thinks that the tempreture mesurement system theyve been using since birth is better
The AI is getting more efficient as we wait and do nothing.
more tiktok big bbg schlatty 😊
(32°F − 32) × 5/9 = 0°C
Stay happy that the most important thing, if you are happy we are happy while we sit here and watch your videos and steams because we don’t have any friends 😢😂
Very 'brave' of you 'jschlatt' to stand up against the tiktok brainrot.
jack is saving this platform
Cool, but where's my money?
again?
Man, I'm glad to see Big Man uploading again!! See you all next year tho 👍
Rest in peace big guy 🕊️
I’m so glad schlatts gonna post more
Metric is good for actual proper data, but it doesnt invalidate imperial, as imperial is more of an estimation that the brain can easily visualize. Imagining someone 6 feet tall is pretty easy. But if you tell me they're (insert bigass number here)cm tall, im gonna look at you with a raised eyebrow. When its hot as balls out, 90° feels a lot more accurate than whatever the metric equivalent is. Both are valid, just a matter of perspective, on whether your looking at specific data measurements, or just estimations of what it looks and feels like
Nono fahrenheit is better for humans. It's a relative scale. 0 is very cold, 100 is very hot, 50 is somewhere in the middle
be happy brother
Oh no he’s gunna become mat pat!
So glad the tiktok stuff is done, liked it at the beginning, but it got very old
there's enough.
wheres the next reaction video? :)
Way excited Schlatt!! 🖤🖤🖤
Rip
Rip shclatt you won’t be missed
youre right abt fahrenheit its more precise. just memorize freezing and boiling its not hard its 32 and 212
Q errar Q bush
I want to see a Jschlatt road trip. That Japan trip was honestly amazing to watch. Give us some good 'ol, yeehaw style, car centric American travel.
Fly high king🕊️
schlatt we’re 70% water…
I don't think things will ever be the same without him, but it's good to have a reminder of how he was like and what we used to do together. It feels so empty now that he is gone, but at least he left us with these memories.
Celsius > Fahrenheit
Im so glad, I never liked those
SHLART
Celsius is better, common jschlatt L
Finally! Schlatt is back!
RIP he was a good man in his old age
finally. the day has come🙏🙏🙏
You made so many peoples days, fly high king 👑 🕊️
needd the weeklyslap
Congrats on announcing your pregnancy Schlatt, hope you and Jambo are happy with the new bundle of joy
finally he is coming out
the skoodle doodle
when i saw the title i thought he was announcing September 11 Part 2
People watch the video for you not reactions of a video
in canada we switch between metric and imperial for measuring with 0 consistency so I don't have an opinion on the matter
Rip
Why is everyone saying rip ?
FINALLY IT HAS CAME, HE STOPED DOING TIKTOK STUFF
what did he see in the water
love your content so much but        CELSIUS IS SO MUCH BETTER YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH
I think I have laughed more at this video than all the reaction videos
I still can't believe it's been a year since "schlott" "died"
Lets thank jambo for doing ai stuff and posting this video - fly high schlatt
ow man.. he was so young, it's like he's still here, my condolences to his family, hope he rest in peace
im so glad that they dont have enough evidence to throw "Schlatt" into prison for what he did in 1999
Get happy Big Guy. And the cease of tiktok is fine. Not missed. But seriously, imperial sucks. Celsius all the way. I don't care when your water boils or freezes it sucks. No sane human wants to hear over a 100 when it comes to just hot weather. 32 celsius is fine, 102 fahrenheit is inhumane. And please stay out of germany. My people can't handle all of that big guy musk. After '45 we've kinda grown soft.
I can't be the only one who dislikes the fake schlatt's death comments...right?
Can't believe my favorite gooner has passed away... Rest in peace schlott
happy to hear you got paroled big guy
Rest in piece big man 🕊️he was a great YouTuber glad people are using ai to remember him
RIP shart !!! hell gained another imp today 🙏🙏🙏 may he rest in pieces (as the swarm left him in) GOD BLESS AMERICA !!!
Holy shit, finally something other than tik tok's. I was getting real close to blowing my brains out (in minecraft).
Thank god “Schlong” is back from the Gulag. Can’t wait for the “ranking the war crimes I have committed in ‘99 ” video
time to smile
Rest in power babygirl 🕊❤
finally the end of tiktok reactions, god has responded to my prayers🙏
Noooooo
Thank fucking God, I was so sick of the reaction videos
RIP to my boy Schlatt, if only he'd known that water boils at 100 degrees, he might not have jumped.
What a beautiful tribute to Josh Scat! He will be missed but I'm looking forward to new AI generated videos using his likeness, might be funnier too! 🙏⚰️
Big W. Reaction videos are like McDonald's, they're fun from time to time but they get old quite quickly
So crazy it's been so long since we lost him 😢 such an inspiration to many and an entertainment for countless. Rest soundly shitsnack ❤
I wonder when
rip shat 💔
Celcius users: Its at 21 degrees, It’s too hot Chang it to 21
bashing the Celsius like that is a major L
Can't believe Ai has gotten this far already
Thank you jambo for uploading this for shalatt he will be missed
Hell yea
Paradox was obviously doing a Honeypot sting on behalf of Interpol but Schlatt evaded them once again.
I hate that I miss Schlatt's streams but atleast I can watch his videos
Honestly I’m glad to see the death of ur reaction videos. Lmao  I only watched them cause they were a good source of schlattalishus content
It's almost like schitt is still alive... RIP Schitt.. You will be missed ❤
I’m so glad your back!!
Nuh uh
RIP Schlatt
🤯
We miss the TikTok’s tho
Man the reaction vids are some of my favorite on the entire platform, as much as I’m pissed to see them go at the same time I’m pretty happy for you
very happy abt this icl
reaction is a terrible drug. rest in pipis schlupp.
FUCK YEAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!
Finally
God, I miss him :( it feels like he is still here with us
RIP Big Guy, you will be missed⚰️
he cant leave the us because he killed the queen.
So sad """""Schlog"""" has passed away, Jambo is an amazing artificial intelligence for making this video! R.I.P
You will be missed slap :(
it’s like I can still hear his voice, We’ll all miss you, Schlatt 🕊️✝️
YouTube apology videos:
monster is the best drink
NO MORE REACTION VIDEOS GOD IS GOOD
the streamed submission ones ruled. ALSO the japan vlog on schlagg? rules
Rest well Schlort, a true soldier bid farewell..
Are you still doing the vods?
hope you can have some fun from now on i'll watch pretty much whatever you make :)
THANK YOU I'VE BEEN SAYING FARENHEIT IS THE BEST TEMPERATURE SYSTEM BECAUSE ITS OPTIMIZED FOR DAILY LIFE!!!
Can’t believe “Shat” is dead. It’s almost like “he’s” still here. Rest in peace. 🕊️
Hiiii 👋
Im glad "schlitt" (RIP) uses the superior temperature measurement
i remember being in chat and like screaming bc i  was so happy that u were streaming lol
it's going to take a while to get over this loss...😔 rip schloup ❤❤🕊
Why is he even more white ????
Its like hes still here.. We miss you Schlatt ❤
stop saying he's "in a better place", he obviously did NOT go to heaven
I’m so glad Schlagg is alive and healthy! He’s totally right. How many hots is it? Like 90 hots. That makes more sense than “oi mate! Izzuh boot 42.069 warms oouht ere!”
like if you miss when schlatt was alive, rest in peace big guy
RIP, Big Guy. Thanks for all the amazing content over the years. You will be missed 😢
Rip Schlutt, you "will" be missed
this is a welcome change
it’s like schlatt is still here with us
My mom laughed at your joke
RIP Schlatt ❤️ So sad to hear prison finally beat you. You will be missed
You hid The promotional Cities Skyline 2 video  In an announcement video. With the thumbnail and title and everything.  Jesus christ you're going to take over the world
RIP  “schlatt” you will be missed
im glad schlatt got to play a game he loves before he died in the tragic car accident😪😲
Ai is crazy these days
2:31 yes… yes we are
This reminds me of when I first found out about Schlatt, back when he was a guest on Soothouse. Things just felt funnier back then, and they feel funny now c:
Personally i get my scatt needs from sleep deprived
epic swag
So no reaction for 9/11?
On this day 1 year ago Schlatt killed the Queen
balls
This video was made by AI
I thought you were dead? What happened?
glad to see you're back, schlatt.
R.I.P "Shatt", he was the best of his time, and the biggest of guys.
I think schlatt ranking every pizza known to man would be essential and relevant due to his new york past in 1999
thank for shalzoggoxtt is ok
oh no hermano
I'm SO very happy that shlatt ended the tiktok stuff. I'm happy that shlett is enjoying his creativity. You can get sucked in the algorithm, but as long as you stay true, you will triumph  with everything you do. RIP TIKTOK COMP REST IN PISS
Damn those plaques
only reason i watched schlatt was cause of him reacting to tiktokt
Kelvin gang rise up
noooo i loved your setup vids and your tiktok vids
I hated seeing you become a react channel, had to stop watching all together. Can't wait to watch your actual content
HE FINALLY CAME BACK WITH THE MILK
If only that drunk driver was never there we would still Have jerma schlatt Fly high king RIP 🕊️🕊️
Yesterday, i was watching one of your tiktok react vids, ando you said something like "if i see one more "Oh it's free schlatt" joke i'm ending this series", i jokingly posted "But it's free", needless to say, i'm terrified that you held to your word.
Do more day z streams.
3:36 does Scylat not know geography? All those other places along with San Francisco are real olaces in real world.
THIS GUY IS A BOMBER 😳😳😱😤🔥🛩️💣💥
I think the reason why they didn't let him leave the country is cus he's on the no fly list
thank you jschlatt, this may as well be the time to smile!
It’s almost like Schlatt is still with us. Thank you for posting this ai schlatt 🕊️ 🙏
Schlatt is it true that you left for so long because you were stuffing your mouth with salt and vinegar Pringles because their your absolutely favourite???
We're so back
Big Man is so back
I’m so proud of Schlatt🫡
please dont be a tiktok reaction video
rip legend
fahrenheit or whatever the fuck... schlatt deserves to go back to prison like 32degree fahrenheit is 0 celcius get help america is dumb
Rest in piece Mr. Live. You will forever be missed.
so sad this is the last video schlatt made before his untimely death. Glad Jambo could upload it for us. RIP Schlorp
holy shit finally a real video instead of tiktok videos
Glad the people from prison didnt know about '99 ! Glad you survived!
"so please watch it" 1:08 Luv u Mr schlatt
welcome back from prison!!
R.I.P. Big man, AI will never replace the og biggest of mankind.
Love the tier lists schlatt
“Ya see I used ya, but anyways here’s more ways for you guys to enjoy this while I use you to get money”

Yoooo big guy
we should milk schlatt
we'll miss him 🙏🏻 rip big guy
Why does god take away the things that keep us whole? Rip shat, I will miss his warmth.
Celsius: The Superior Temperature Scale, Simplicity and Scientific Consistency One of the primary reasons Celsius is better than Fahrenheit is its simplicity and scientific consistency. The Celsius scale is based on the freezing and boiling points of water, where 0°C is the freezing point and 100°C is the boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure. In contrast, the Fahrenheit scale is less intuitive, with 32°F as the freezing point and 212°F as the boiling point of water. The arbitrary nature of the Fahrenheit scale makes it less user-friendly, especially for scientific purposes and international communication. Celsius, on the other hand, is widely used in scientific research, making it more consistent and easier to understand globally. Celsius offers superior ease of conversion when compared to Fahrenheit. Celsius and Kelvin, another common temperature scale used in scientific contexts, are directly related through a simple formula: Celsius = Kelvin - 273.15. This direct relationship makes it effortless to convert between Celsius and Kelvin, which is essential in scientific calculations and experiments. Converting between Celsius and Fahrenheit, however, is more cumbersome and requires a more complex formula: Fahrenheit = (Celsius × 9/5) + 32. This added complexity can lead to errors, especially when working with temperature data from different sources or collaborating with scientists worldwide who use Celsius. Celsius enjoys widespread global adoption, making it the preferred temperature scale in the scientific community, and by extension, in most countries. The United States is one of the few countries that still predominantly uses the Fahrenheit scale for everyday temperature measurements. This global preference for Celsius ensures consistent communication and understanding of temperature-related information across borders. Celsius is part of the metric system, which is the most widely used system of measurement worldwide. The metric system is based on powers of ten, making it easier to work with in various scientific disciplines. By using Celsius, a temperature scale aligned with the metric system, countries can maintain consistency in their units of measurement, simplifying scientific research, trade, and international collaboration. Celsius is more practical for everyday use, especially in determining weather conditions and setting temperature-related standards. On the Celsius scale, a temperature increase from 10°C to 20°C is the same as an increase from 20°C to 30°C. This makes it easier for people to gauge temperature changes and adapt accordingly. Fahrenheit, with its smaller degrees and larger differences between them, can be less intuitive for quick assessments of weather and temperature-related decisions. While personal preferences often shape our views on whether Celsius is better than Fahrenheit, the objective advantages of Celsius as a temperature scale are hard to ignore. Its simplicity, scientific consistency, ease of conversion, global adoption, alignment with the metric system, and practicality make it a superior choice for temperature measurements in a wide range of contexts. Although change can be challenging, embracing Celsius as the standard temperature scale would align the United States with international norms, making it easier for Americans to communicate and collaborate on global scientific, industrial, and meteorological endeavours.
Schlatt you’re ruining my state… keep going
european measurement system is better, americans have to step on each other to measure their height
He almost got out of prison. But he got shot in his middle. Lets take a moment to remember the legend. Rest in peace "schlatt"
Blood boils at 100 at well
finally... I just miss schlatt, funniest guy I had seen on youtube only to be reduced to a cameo or guest I see in other people's videos and a curator of tiktok videos. I was feeling bad at how it went from top to bottom of the barrel for me, especially after I grew bored of the reaction videos. Hopefully if Jschlatt gets happier and more proud of his content, maybe he can make another video essay, which is totally different from the reason I watch now but it was still something I really used to like. (I didn't watch Jschlatt for the comedy back then, I do watch for comedy now)
Bring back radiohead
The submission streams were actually fun but honestly mods shouldn't have to see dead animals again💀
L
Ok Fahrenheit is better for people so if you think of as a percentage that what it is and Celsius is like oh this water is 84% hot but Fahrenheit is like oh I'm 72% hot and kelvin is the same for air so yes Fahrenheit is better for people
Schloppers seems so alive... Rest in peace Big Guy
Rip sykolkp
He will be remembered 🕊🕊❤️
THANK GOD THAT WE AINT DOIN REACTION VIDEOS ANY MORE
He will be remembered 🕊🕊❤️
LETS GOOO
Congrats Schlatt on completing the milking. I can't wait for you to find new things to milk
This comments section is EXACTLY what i expect of this fanbase. Proud of you, guys.
Rest in peace gaychlatt❤❤
rip jschlatt..
Rip man you will be missed 😔🕊️🪦
You’re doing a great job big guy, do what you want and makes you happy.
And so an era comes to a close. It is finished.
Bro a Tokyo Lens shout out 😂
I am 70% water and I feel called out...
Rest in peace big guy, you made the world a better place while you were here.         No you didn’t
Congrats to whoever edited this, at 8:05 someone in chat said "<---- true" with something offensive I image as an username and it was edited out the name. If that's not attention to detail I don't know what is
Schlatt I can’t post to the subreddit because the reddit admins permabanned me for saying “destroy the child” on r/mildlyinfuruating. What do I do?  Before anyone asks, no, I’m not sorry for what I said.
i miss him so much
W take
We are so back!!!!!
Rip the big man, sad to see him go, can’t believe he recorded this before he died. Rip shlatt😭😭
Water in Celsius: boils at 100° and freezes at 0° Water in Farenheit: Boils at 112 and freezes at 32°, 🤮
Dead? Yes or no yep
5:19 I thought this mother fucker said n word xD
Holy fuck what have I done
rip gaylatt
FINALLY THANK GOD, IM SICK OF THESE REACTION VIDEOS
Return of the Wii
I once had an amazing fan interaction with Schlatt recently! He crawled out of a dumpster, shot me in both of my arms and then went away screaming “NEW YORK JANKEES!!!” Truly the fan interaction of all time.
Wrong.
RIP Schlatt you will almost be missed🥹
bro uploaded on the anniversary of the queens death 💀
I’m American and I know for a fact you have no reason to think Fahrenheit makes more sense it absolutely does not. 0-100C* is 32-212F* dummy there’s no reason to think this
Again?
Well, after what happemed in 1999, I wouldn't let you out of your house, let alone the country
Will you be freeing my family now?
fahrenheit is better in the context of temperatur for humans bec its based on that. so for example the weather but for litteraly everything and i mean everything else, kelvin or celsius is better
Its Nice of you adressort the touchknappar kids alegations blessings from irak 🇮🇶 😔😔😭😭😭
thanks big guy i am so fucking tired of ONLY reactions and i really missed the streams n cities especially because i started becoming a vod watcher after you quit for the second time so this'll be pretty cool i cheered when i saw finale on the last reaction video until you changed it too lmao
these scheduled uploads have me feeling like he's still here. RIP big guy we'll never forget you. thoughts and prayers
I would love to see schlatt rank soda as his next video
It's truly amazing that Schmeatt can improve San Francisco even in death
BIG GUYS BACK!
Honestly, I would love another tier list video. Aside from your bad opinions and spice intolerance those videos go really hard... if you know what I mea-
Rest in peace. He was so young. 😭 Hope heaven is treating him well. 🙏
Schlatt  Now that you have passed, may i have jambo so i can deepfry him in 10 litres of mule flavored monster energy?
HE’S BACK HE’S BACK HE’S BACK I’M SO SO SO FREAKING EXCITED! I’ve missed your streams SO MUCH, I’m so glad you’re coming back no matter the content
"The pollution's already starting boys, this is not bad."
jschlatt ich liebe dich bitte bringen sie mich nach Deutschland!!!
Oh Schlatt , what’s changing ? Is it the fact that your changing your mind and finally telling us what your motive was for what you did back in 1999 ?
People were making me question things when they were say rip. DON’T DO THAT TO ME AGAIN
big guy the evidence is on my moms computer in a folder titled: "sorry big guy" don't worry man, the authorities only check my house of residence twice a week and they haven't got time to check it anyways <3
Would you rather have no reactions but infinite streams or no streams but no reactions
It's so nice that whoever found this prerecorded video and uploaded it for us to enjoy. I still miss him every day. Eventhough he was fucking stupid for saying that fahrenheit is better than celcius like the typical american he is.
It finally came back full circle.
my condolences to schrödinger’s family. it’s crazy how we all feel like he’s still here, but sadly he’s gone. RIP
Fahrenheit> literally has a book named after it called Fahrenheit 451
I cant beleive that hes gone, just a little while ago he was so full of life. Rest in piece big man 🕊🕊🕊
Schlatt is finally coming back to make our lives terrible again for his own amusement and monetary gain
I’m scared when father tells me there’s gonna be some changes around here.
Rest in piece. One of my favorite peopl. You will be missed. 3:08
ngl im pretty dumb, so celcius helps me a bunch. I enjoy seeing the city skylines return though
igh
Never thought that the stuff he did in Dresden in 2007 will catch up to him like that.  RIP Schlurp, you were the real one 😞🕊🇲🇾
Man im so Sad Schlatingulus Died on an electric chair rest in piece king that man deserved what you did to him
WOOOO NO MORE REACTION VIDEOS
Here it is. My favourite white boy
Im glad that jschllllllllllllll
rip big man. </33
Shoulda never done that shit in '99
Celsius is simply better. When it freezes the temperature goes into the -degrees. It's so simple
thank you for finally stopping most reaction content and being able to do other stuff other than sleep deprived finally the garbage has been taken out
2:24 yes, i am water.       and yes i like men.
This video has zero entertainment
disgusting inbred, how is 32 fahrenheit like the most random god damn disgusting number out there going to be logical to "Oh its cold" unlike celsius because it says 0° BECAUSE 0 IS LIKE THERE IS ALMOST NO TEMPERATURE SO IT IS COLD THEN HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY IT BEING LIKE 72° FAHRENHEIT which sounds like its boiling outside, when its actually just 24° celsius which means it is hot af and its just a bit windy and nice
good god thank you no more damn ticktock crap it melts your brain.
So glad you back big guy
are you white
thank god its over
Schlatt would post this on the anniversary of The Queen’s death, they always come back to the scene of the crime.
finally jschlatt will upload good content again
RIP in peace old hag 🙏❤🪦 We will miss you
vibes big tit
I don’t care
Fahrenheit is objectively terrible for measuring temperature. The numbers are not big enough. Kelvin is significantly more manly as the numbers go up to temperatures higher than i can count. Fahrenheit is weak, Kelvin is best!!!
I don't like change
The reaction videos were the reason at least why I stopped watching the channel, so kudos to u schlatt, cant wait to see new good content big guy
Yippe
tiktok
I appreciate that the videogames content is back, of course in vod form but these are my favorite videos of yours. been watching for 4 years now so thank you for the return of this content format.
Fly high shallot ❤️❤️😭😭
At least we're getting more ranking videos
I. Am. HYPED for the return of rankings.
wow
this AI stuff is getting crazy Even after Schucchini was given the death penalty for the crime spree committed in 1999 and connection to the mafias of 54 different countries, his voice and face can still be perfectly recreated
Shit man, can i see your corpse?
YAYY!
I’m really, really happy that we’re getting a bit of a return to form.
It’s real crazy how “jschlatt” got deepfaked and Jambo had to post this video. R.I.P Big man!
Jschlatt has an issue of 0 self restraint whenever he runs a successive video idea, he talks about wanting to do a balance, but instead does it nonstop until he hates it
I am so fucking down for more rants. If there's one thing good in this world, it's when new yorkers really hate something.
Joe biden
yeah im subscribed to a felon,what about it?
Rip shlatt 😢😢 🪦🪦💔💔
Lets thank Kim Jong Un for bringing back Jschlatt through AI... RIP Jschlatt. You'll be missed...
glad to see a change coming from the big guy himself, hopefully you make more content that you're happy with, as that will make it far better than any forced type of videos!!!!!!!  unsubscribed, tell me when you're back to the toks 🙏♥
oct 24th is my bday les go best birthday gift
I can’t wait for this channel to abandon its regular content and devolve into another radicalized far-right page
Can’t believe Schlatt is finally quitting YouTube, but we should have suspected it after the events of 1999 😔🤙. Rest in peace Big Guy 🙏🏻
Can’t believe schlatt is on a first name basis with Mr. Krabs.
SCHLATT IS BACK, BABY!!
"Don't be sad because it's over smile because it happened" -A wise man
Wow That's Intense and Also Rest In peace we'll really miss you Schlatt
I’m so glad “Schlatt” is returning to the original style of the tiktok videos. I prefer that kind. If only he was here I would thank him
im not coping. celcius is way more useful for the weather. 0 is when things start to frost and when rain becomes snow or hail, instead of 3294 farenheit being freezing temperature
There is nothing weirder to hear than "This video is sponsored by Paradox Interactive" until you remember that the same people that made my silly map painting games also made the city bonk game. Anyways glad to hear you're taking a step in the right directions big man! Can't wait to see you do what you love! :D
converting from Fahrenheit to kelvin is fucking annoying for thermodynamics. Fuck fahrenheit
Shlatt was a good entertainer for this platform. I have to speak on everyone’s part on this one. Mr Shat will be missed, he died being loved by his community and we will all be saddened that he will no longer ‘rank our favourite TikTok’s 😢’ bully Minx and so much more. My true concerns reach out to Shats cats Jambo and ‘unidentified cat No.2’, he will no longer be able to feed them manually so they will have to live off his corpse, aswell as the auto-feeder. His family isn’t mentions as we all know about *the incident of ‘99* but hey! I’m going off track here.  Some of Shats biggest achievements are *REDACTED* of ‘99, and the ever so recent ol’ Elizabeth. The allegations are true.   I personally believe the British caught up to him. Beat him down with their plastic batons, and then made him rank our TikTok’s. Unfortunately this was a tipping point for him and in that certain and sad case. Jshat had died. Most likely from the Shellshock of the gay kissing from ‘cooking videos’.  Shat. You will be missed 😢 (Pay me for more funeral directions 🙏 I need the money or I’ll have to start ranking TikTok’s)   congrats you’ve read my monologue.
make "schlatt" play hoi4
Great video, but I have to say the editing was too fast for me. I feel like there wasn't a second in the video where you could stop and laugh, almost like it was edited like a tiktok. Maybe I'm just saying this because I've already watched the whole vod though.
Lesson of the day: Schlatt supports the conservative party in Canada and has rigged the upcoming election
Rest in peace Jschlatt.  This video brings back old memories.
2:26 this is so true, Fahrenheit is actually so much better than Celcius when it comes to everyday life. 100°F is really hot, 0°F is really cold. 0°C is really cold, 100°C you're dead.  There's also a way bigger range with Fahrenheit so that you don't have to be super spot on with what the temperature is but you can get decently close. Like if it's decently hot but you're not drenched in sweat, you'll guess the temperature will be like 70-80°F, and when you check it's 77°F. In Celcius land if you're not super accurate you'll have the wrong temperature in your head. The difference between one unit of Celcius is too big, like 15° and 16° feel way too different for them to only be one unit apart.
So sad that he got 30 years for participating in January 6th, it was fun while it lasted though
I will really miss "schlatter" its been nice watching his vids
Wait why does this guy actually sound like schlatt?
RIP Jshlatt, thanks to jambo 4 uploading
celsius is good for measuring the temperature of things fahrenheit is good for measuring the temperature of people
Bring back JackBox
Im deeply saddened by the news, you will be deeply missed. Rest in peace big guy.🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏♥♥♥♥♥
It feels like he’s still here, rest in peace, Shart.
Let's go new schlatt stuff
Rest in peace schlatt🕊🕊
RIP Sclatt. we will miss you. i hope your cats enjoy eating your corpse
Schlatt... I know what you did a year ago
Every city planner in America since 1920: 4:00
HOW DOES HE KNOOOOOOWWW
Say what you will about jshlill, but he's at least informative about channel changes. Unlike other channels. None in particular, it's just a large amount of them now.
make good videos again
Rest In peace schlatt, we’ll really miss you 🕊️🕊️🕊️
Thanks Ludwig, your AI impression is good, but we all know Schlig Schlungus got the electric chair for ‘99
I dont understand how to use farhenheit like idk even know if its good or not i simply dont understand it at all
How have you not been sent to prison for what happened to the Queen yet?
Rest in peace schlott😞
10:00 cant say i expected a dark souls reference in cities skylines
w
"You Dont Have Enough Evidence of That", Little does he know, ive personally hired 4chan to get my revenge after what schlatt did to me and my family in 99. Im coming for you schlatt
Looks like 1999 incident karma got him R.i.p schlang
Can't believe they let schlatt out after serving only a fraction of his sentence for the horrors he did in '99. Glad to see that he's back though!
Glad to see this stream get a video. I watched it while sick out of mind and it was great.
OUR GAY DADDY IS BACK!!!! POGGING SO HARD. HES NOT DEAD
I love how the majority of the comments are "rip schlatt" and then he responds with I'm not dead, and they just say ur wrong
Thank god
RIP schplatt you a real one
FUCK YEA!
I still miss jayscat
He’s right though
the slop is finally over letsgooo, please finish the radiohead essay plz
Fahrenheit is better better below 0 is dangerous to be outside, and above 100 is too dangerous
Wait a second we’re those preuploads because Schlatt was in prison because of what happened a year ago today that he said he has nothing to do with
Hope he doesn’t stop playing Minecraft next.
9/11 sequel?
Rest In Peace big guy, hope your time with God is filled with thing the libs
R.i.p schlattitude and schlongitude, you will be missed
finnaly a differnet flavour of slop
things indeed will change bc i breathe in after 23 hours
Fly High Shlinkus 🙏🙏
Rest in Piss Scholitt
farenheit doesn't make Sense what is wrong w you
1:19 what of original video is this?
Mans alive i think 🤔
I loved the reddit reviews and submissions that you used to do, I'm glad to see that your doing what you enjoy!
Hey schlatt, im very happy with your veggie straws rating on the chips video. Im looking forward to seeing your new content.
It's like he's still with us  Fly high King 🕊️🕊️🕊️
It’s so sweet how “Schlatt” decided to upload this on the anniversary of his victory over Britain, Lizzie would’ve loved this video.
finally the only fans is here
Good to see your finally breaking free of the reaction prison the algorithm trapped you in, very exciting news ❤.
Fully supporting you, brother. We were there when your face was oval shaped and we're here now that it's gotten full circle. In thin and thicc, we'll keep you company.
Fly high big man 🪦🌹🕊️🕊️
YES LETS GO NO MORE TIKTOK REACTION VIDS
Fahrenheit is so fucking stupid
Let's go 99
No more 9/11 impressions?
Happy 1 year anniversary of that time you killed the Queen of England! 🎉
glad he is back form prison, Its so convenient that the storage facility burnt down containing so called evidence
It’s like he’s still here ty soup for telling us about this rip jschlatt
Good idea
hopefully we will finally get a part 2 of the Rabbid's Go Home video
I miss Shatmyself already..💔💔Fly high king.🕊️🕊️
W take on celsius
please run out of money 🙏
its so sad that shaft died , jambo posting this must be a sign from him in heaven that hes looking out for all of us 🙏  rest in peace shellter 😭❤️
Yes
The reason most of us watch reaction videos is NOT because we want to see some dude react. It's because it filters all the good videos to watch in one compilation. Honestly I tend to skip over the bits where the youtuber starts rambling.
Please don't post reactions videos anymore your original videos are so much better
celsius is better
What a heartwarming video 🥰
Rest in penis shaft you won't be missed <3 🕊 🙏🗣🗣
I don’t care
i will never forget you're horrible deeds of 99' but R.I.P jschlatt😥😰😰😭😭🙏🙏  Edit:  What's with these homies, dissing my girl?  Why do they gotta front? What did we ever do to these guys  That made them so violent?  Woo-hoo  But you know I'm yours Woo-hoo  And I know you're mine  Woo-hoo  (And that's for all time)  Ooh-wee-hoo, I look just like Buddy  Holly  Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore  I don't care what they say about us anyway  I don't care about that    Don't you ever fear, I'm always near  I know that you need help
Thank gor
he is have died :(
daddys back
I thought I could escape loadshedding on YouTube🥲🥲
This AI is getting really good. It almost looks exactly like him
TTL DW - is he ded yet
Where does he stream?
In all honesty, Kelvin is the best unit for temperature.
The return of the Cities Skyline streams is a blessing
I’ll always miss “schlatt”
0 celsius and under is freezing and 100 is boiling. I dont understand how that is so stupid T_T never understood Fahrenheit
When are you going to destroy the mr beast play button
Fahrenheit sounds cool but is dogshitt
Was so sad when Big Schlitt got ganked in prison. Glad he got resurrected, thank you Lord 🙏
2:24 yes, about 70% of it, actually
yaaaaaaaaaay jschlat is back weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
I love shlatt, hes so kind and humble and actually cares about his performance and viewers. Like this comment if you like big booth black midgets shaking their booty
Based
FINALY NO TIKTOK VIDEO REACTING!
i actually agree with the Fahrenheit take. People might make fun of you for disregarding that C is boiling temp for water at 100, but the point is that it's not as intuitive as Fahrenheit in many the casual day-to-day settings. The scale of 0 to 100 in Celsius starts with pretty cold (0) to just outright being dead (100). In Fahrenheit 0 is very cold and 100 is pretty hot. You'll see that more often than not, the 0 to 100 scale for Fahrenheit is just more useful in an everyday setting, its only the other way around when you're doing science or math.
Im so excited to see you back, Schlatt!!!! I can't wait to see what's next!!!!
TODAY IS A GOOD DAY
As an engineering student. I stand for the metric on everything except temperature and height in normal life. Fuck centimeters. Also, fuck measuring in SLUGS, like wtf even is that.
I do love the tiktok reactions for some reason. It's like junk food entertainment. Great, but gotta keep it in small doses. I'd be fine if you did some now and then, but it's great to see the gameplay videos again. Love your stuff!
WWWWWWW
Let’s goooo
your laugh is contagious, thats why i love those reaction vids
this announcement is like 9/11 for people without brains
thank god he stopped with the reaction
Okay, this AI shit is getting out of hand. This is so disrespectful to Schlitty, let him Rest In Peace 🕊
Yay food ranking they are the funniest
Happy Anniversary Schlatt!!!!!
Didn’t hear a word you said. The hair was talking. :)
im to dumb to play city skylines, i cant even run my own life let alone a whole ass city
As a person who watched this video. I can confirm that things will be changing.
I thought they had found out about '99
Schlatt
It's bein a year schlatt...  She's bein dead for a year
What did he do? Why is he on the no fly list?
Fuck
Honestly I’m so happy you’re done with milking the reactions. I’ve seen some of your stuff on Schlagg and I’m happy to see stuff you’re more enthusiastic about.
Rip slaggot🕊 fly high🕊🕊🇺🇸🛢🕊🕊🕊🕊
Schlatt making himself the 1% will never get old
He's back and he didn't drop the soap wooooooo!
why did you say milking it to completion.
i just started watching. i hope he starts an onlyfans
I love submission jshotdaqueen
The city skylines videos were some of my favorite, glad to see them back
Welcome back from prison we missed you 🫂 - kade
WHY DOES ICE MELT AND WATER FREEZE AT 32 IN FARENHEIT
It's almost like he's still here. We miss you "Schlatt"  See you in heaven Big Guy
Heaven gained another angle 🙏🙏🙏 rest in piece Splatt 😢
The new Shlatt Era!
Yes
Missed you Jschlatt Glad Your Back from Prison✨
play wrestling empire, I think the subway area of that game could bring back some good memories of 99'
This is like his 5th reboot
Film some shit outside. Your video on the range with Slime and Swagger is the best thing you've ever uploaded.
Finally schalt is back I can finally get my 1200 dollars for smuggling the body across the bord-
I swear to god man, These comments are NOT funny. WE ALL KNOW YOU ARE ALIVE *right?*
Okay Schlag
rip schlatt
more vids like the wii extravaganza would be dope
At least our water boils at a flat 100 degrees.
Schlatt gets to be happy
Ofc this is posted on the queens death day
Please make more tik tok reactions I love em
We'll never forget you "Jschlatt" rest in peace!  Ai has gotten amazing to see!
I cant wait for submission content to be completely SFW and wholesome for Schlatt to watch for all of us!
When bank Robery video
First
LETS GO TREVORRRRRRR
FINALLLLLLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
"Things are about to change" They did it They finally found out what he did in 1999
Love to see ya back bug Guy
i still can’t believe it. i wake up, thinking he’s still here, then get faced with the cruel reminder he’s moved on to better things.  thank you for everything jebidiah, i hope you can rest in peace.
Look if you’re from United States midatlantic to northeast then Fahrenheit makes so much intuitive sense. Coldest day you can remember? Probably around 0. Hottest day you can remember? Probably around 100
a new era of schlatt has started and i am totally here for it. seriously, i can't wait to see more of cities skylines and the glorious tier list videos
Schlatt people (including myself) liked the setup tour videos because its not every day you need to break into a abandoned house with your pc, table and gaming chair. Take some traffic signs, shopping carts, feet - decorate the entire place and send it to jschlatt mods. But dont make it too naughty because the mods will find you
NO MORE JSCHLATT REACTION SLOP !!!!!!! I USED TO PRAY FOR TIMES LIKE THESE
Oh boy
It’s like I can still hear his voice 😢❤RIP
So glad the 16 cases of embezzlement didn't stick 🙏
No, go back to the basement, I want more rection videos
It’s such a blessing having the tik tok curse lifted 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Bro imperial is so good for measuring a persons height
Looking forward! Hadn't watched in a while cuz reaction ain't my cuppa so fuck yeah :D!
Keep doing what makes you happy big guy! And don't worry,  with the evidence I've gathered you'll be locked away soon enough
Nooo i loved them 😢
RIP schlitty...fly high 😭
Rest in peace “Jschlatt”. They finally got him for what happened in 99
YESSS🎉🎉🎉
0c+0c=0c  32f+32f=64f  i rest my case
So happy I won't have to see Shlatt reuploading clips that he uploaded on his other channels that are reuploaded from this channel anymore
WELL JUDGE, YOU HEARD THE MAN WE DONT HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO CONVICT THIS MAN CALL THE FEDS OFF
HE’S FINALLY BACK…again
RIP Schlatt  '99 finally caught up with the man At least the AI can carry this forward
Rest in peace my dude, you made lots of people smile, thanks you, 💔🕊️😔
I fully thought this was gonna be a confession video about what you did to the queen.
Welcome back to the mortal plane Schlatt
Can we get more weekly slap videos?
Schlatt escaped from Prison
I'd love to see more PC setup and Bedroom reactions. Those were horrendously cursed.
Celsius gang
It's so sad to hear about slop's passing. I'm gonna miss you, brother, and I hope your husbands can get through and process their loss. 🙏🏻
OMG, HE'S FINALLY BACK FROM PRISON (he was arrested for killing the Queen of England)!
The end of an era, and the beginning of a new legend. 🤩
Thanks for all the slop, Schlatt!
Thank you jambo, your cosplay of gayshlutt is really good
Rest in pieces jarpschlarp you live quite a life 💔 so young yet so beautiful...an angel taken from us to soon 😿
really excited for this era big guy
Ok that’s cool and all, but what about raving rabids?
fly high big man ~🕊️
Your telling me its 100 degrees outside, what the fuck are you talking about??? 100 degrees, why are we not dead what????
Sometimes i can still hear his voice, it’s like he’s still here with us😔💔🕊️ RIP
Rest in peace shclinky, we will miss you greatly 🙏
Cant wait for him to build Obamaland 2 in cities skylines 2.
Schlatt is litteraly unable to make a video at this point, he just has to put clips of his actual videos into it.
seeing the not just bikes tweet made me laugh a lot
Finally! I knew eventually schlatt would stop the reaction shit because I honestly can’t watch that SLOP. Welcome back my brotha I’ve been waiting excitedly 😃
You should do Oracle Park
Why do I feel like this is a response to the xQc react format drama?
Fly high Jshlut
the tiktok vids were the best
loved his content over the years still cant belive hes gone 🪦🪦my heart goes out to his family and friends in this tough time, while we shouldnt forget his victims in the 99 incedent we also shouldnt forget him. gone to soon rest in peace jigglesomeballs schlatt x ❤😭
Finally so happy hes back from prison🎉🎉 you shouldnt have done those crimes in 1999 🙄
3,531'th
hi "schlatr"
Outside of purgatory
To be honest I really miss Jackbox
so glad ai has come so far to immortalize his legacy <3 Rest in Peace
schlatt, we all know you went and did prison time, we still love you
RIP Schlatt… gonna miss you… L RIP
i love you babygirl
Wooooo yeah baby!
The Queen of England died 1 year ago. Last year was my best birthday.
Hehe
He evolved beyond tick tock!
Just do whatever dude, I’m here for your humor it made the Tik Toks 10x better anyways
Can everybody shut the hell up about schlatt being dead it's a getting annoying.
WOOOOOO!! LETS GOOO
Did you still watch gay porn in prison because i know you can't handle 3 seconds without your gay porn?
FINALLY ITS OVER
Fly high, Big Guy, fly high 👼 🕊️
Got scared for a min with that title ngl
I am seriously excited for the ratings! You have done a Tierlist of Chips before...which was neat. But did you ever try some from Turkey? Yes, Turkey. They have some incredible chips that I really do recommend. Have a good one man.
All of schlatts videos are god tier, they always made me laugh, but I’m happy that more is coming soon! You are Fucking amazing Schlatt
We will miss mister schlaat❤❤😢😢
We have lost another one.. its so heartbreaking to see an AI talk for him.. biggest love to his family..   Goodbye forever, Schlatt💗
THANK The Lord, Schlatt. The reaction videos got 14% worse for every episode you didn't have chat and viewer submissions, and the streams are endlessly entertaining - I don't understand why you switched from that to your moderators scouring tiktok and I don't want an explanation, but I'm very glad you're backtracking and I hope you are rewarded handsomely.
I was laughing for so much of this. I forgot how funny Schlatt can be when he's actually trying.
Celsius is stupid. I like metric length and volume though (mainly because I can’t remember).
Thank god i hate reaction content
We are so Barrack
glad you're now back to your old self.
60% of our body is water, are you stupid?
MY FAVORITE MURDERER IS COMING BACK TO STREAMING!!!!
It is almost like I can hear him. He was such a big part of all of our lives. Love this rest in piece video. RIP 😢😢😢😢❤❤❤
I wish there was a way to hide twitch chat.
To be honest, I'm glad he's making these changes. Sure, Tiktok reactions are doing numbers, but I've been waiting to see some new, high effort project that Schlatt really cares about. This is really great news, looking forward for new stuff, Big Guy
ENOUGH SLOP. GIVE ME MEALS.
Thanks for all the laughs and memories Schlegg RIP You'll be missed
Imperial system still sucks  And Kelvin is the only measurement unit for  temperature
Schlatussy is a great and funny glad your back from selling yourself to the US military until 2029
Jesus loves you
we miss you ‘Schlatt’! rest in peace big guy 😭
If Schlatt was still alive, I'm sure he'd love to see this diverse content. R.I.P. Schlatt
The frog has more clout. The frog was on the crane. Weep for a god that is not there 🐸
Lets go a new Schlag video
NO MORE TIKTOK! YAY
when will they make iron sky 3?
1:00 YESSSS finally, fucking finally i hated those things.
Imagine see this video after not see a schlatt video after a long time and then see those comments 💀💀💀
"back on you guys submission" LETS FUCKING GO, i was so tired of tiktok
is he finally gonna shave the sideburns
Should’ve made a last one where the thumbnail smile has changed to a death stare and its only 8 minutes long and your just cursing oit eveyr tiktok
Schlatt we will miss you, you have always been the best, and though my tax payments are overdue, i want to commit serial incest
3 days left till his anniversary
Ain' no way they gonna let you go to Germany after that shit you pulled in the UK on 8th of September 2022
Schlaft
i legit do not care about you °f opinion so i'll let you guys corect my essay on the wheels mini-game in sea of stars the minigame is a two player game where the objective is to reduce your opponents hearth points to 0 to do this there are figures you can choose from each with special abilities and 'notch' counts these notches represent how many Blue or orange token you need to activate the figure the color the figure requires depends on if the figure is on the left or right side once all notches are activated the figure attacks you get these token by spinning five wheels on your side these can by a three blue token, a two blue token, a one blue token, a three orange token, a two orange token, a one orange token, a three building token, a two building token, a one building token, and upgrade versions of the orange/blue tokens. how it works to have tokens activate you need at least three of one token with two token counting for two and three token counting as three upgrade versions of these tokens give your figure of that color a +1 to their upgrade once they have five to their upgrade they rank up from copper to silver form silver to gold and is a gold figure get five they do an extra attack dealing two damage when a figure attack your opponent they also gain +2 to their upgrade. for building tokens they allow you to build a wall with three building a 1 brick high wall and each subsequent building token giving a +1 to the wall total the max height for you wall is 5. for setup each player chooses two figures each having a different notch count then the player spin the five wheels locking in what token they want to keep and then they spin again with locked in tokens for spinning and lock in again if they want to and a third and final time where what you get is final with your locked in tokens again not spinning if have locked in five tokens the player can choose to end their turn of to unlock certain token to spin those tokens again the player have the ability to unlock any token they have locked in until the final spin the spinning process is done on the players own terms and once they have finished they wait for their opponent is finished spinning  or if their opponent is already fished the combat starts with the first thing happening is a well being build then upgrade tokens give the upgrades and then the support figures if anyone has any and then the other figures in a specific order as well  with the support figure order is assassin making opponent figure with lowest notch count go up (this can not be done against other assassins), Engineer wall building, Priest healing the player health points, Priest lowering ally's notch count, and then attacking with assassin going first then Engineer then warrior then archer and then mage for the figure stats: warrior copper/bronze having a damage of 3 and if blocked by a wall waking the wall go down by 3 Warrior silver having a damage of 5 and if blocked by a wall waking the wall go down by 5 Warrior gold: having a damage of 7 and if blocked by a wall waking the wall go down by 5 the warrior is always blocked by any level of wall Mage Copper/bronze having a damage of 2 and if blocked by a wall waking the wall go down by 2 Mage Silver having a damage of 3 and if blocked by a wall waking the wall go down by 3 Mage gold having a damage of 3 and if blocked by a wall waking the wall go down by 5 The mage attacks twice one being able to be blocked by any level wall and the second being 6 units high being unable to be blocked  Archer copper/bronze having a damage of 3 and if blocked by a wall waking the wall go down by 1 Archer Silver having a damage of 4 and if blocked by a wall waking the wall go down by 2 Archer gold having a damage of 6 and if blocked by a wall waking the wall go down by 3 the archer sheets shoots a single arrow being 4 units high being able to be blocked by level 4 or 5 walls Assassin Copper/bronze Having a damage of 1 and making to opponent figure with the lowest notches go up by 1 Assassin Silver Having a damage of 2 and making to opponent figure with the lowest notches go up by 1 Assassin gold Having a damage of 2 and making to opponent figure with the lowest notches go up by 2 the assassin attacks once and cannot be blocked by walls Engineer bronze/copper damage of 1 and if blocked by a wall waking the wall go down by 3 Engineer silver damage of 2 and if blocked by a wall waking the wall go down by 5 Engineer Gold damage of 4 and if blocked by a wall waking the wall go down by 5 the engineer attacks once and is blocked by any level of wall the engineer also increases your wall level by 3 Priest Copper/bronze Heals the player by 1 lowers ally's notch count by 2 Priest silver Heals the player by 2 lowers ally's notch count by 2 Priest gold Heals the player by 2 lowers ally's notch count by 3 the priest does not deal damage
when he argues about Celsius and Fahrenheit i like how he leaves out the part where he argues with himself and losses
wow
183395th
But they make me so happy ;-;
RIP ❤
kitties in the background :3
Rest in peace "Schlatt", if that's even your name.
176kth
I miss him already 😢
It's absolutely insane the amount of City Skylines 2 videos that dropped today!
Out big guy from earth is off to meet the big guy upstairs. Rest in Peace our One True King.
About damn time we got him back
I WANT MORE TIKTOK REACTIONS REEEEEEEEEEE
so excited!!!
Rip to the big man. Guess the royal family is still holding a grudge after all that Queen stuff
The ai stuff is too accurate and  entertaining r.I.p “schatt”
this is great :) it's awesome that you're trying to get back to a better work-life balance! i'm looking forward to(maybe) catching a stream( :( highly unlikely) and seeing the big stuff you've got planned. much love big guy, wishin you the best
Please more cities skylines 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
I appreciate the honesty. You're still one of my favourite creators, who I thoroughly enjoy watching !  I am pretty sure that streaming phase won't last very long though, but glad to see some streams coming !
So so happy this big grimbo is back to being himself. I hated the react videos cause they were so unauthentic
I hope this doesn't blow up or he just gonna milk update videos
dude this is probably the most mature popular youtuber move i've seen from the youtuber from the popular youtuber with the least mature character
Thank you schlatt, missed you
7:56 that sounds more German than American
Schlatt I’m so happy you are back with some content! My favorite videos are honestly just you hanging out playing/doing something you enjoy. Might be an unpopular opinion with how your views are, but if you ever wanna take a chill pill on this channel know that it’s totally cool. Keep going big man!
🕊️🕊️🕊️
Fahrenheit is literally not better
farenhieght it better. you've converted me
Schlage have you smiled today? ✨
Glad that your ditching the mindless tiktok stuff, hope to see more videos like the openTTD, ya clearly put a good amount of effort in those and it shows
Oh man I thought jachlatt was finally taking over as emperor of Texas and soon the world.
So glad, but how is farenheit better than Celsius???? Rare schlat L
imo, skyline isn't the same with the adhd editing and mainstream youtube aesthetic. it feels kinda off, but maybe that's just cause i enjoyed the old series so much.
We accept this offer
WHYYYYY 😭😭😭😭😭😭 WHARA DOOOO
hooray
nice
Its just so sad, rest in peace big guy
omg nooooooo
This ai content is getting good. Rip schlatt 🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️
Always happy to see you back and coming back to variety content!
Guys this is so sad RIP jay shlart
I miss him so much that I still hear his voice everywhere!
RIP Schart You will be missed🕊️Fly High King
Rest in peace, Schlatt. We will never know what happened that night in 92…
Don't get caught again ok? 🗿
This sounds OMINOUS
Bro doesnt know he’s more than half water
what is this goober yip yappin on about
Lmao when elon musk smoked weed on rogan tesla stock dropped 9%
Well, I saw this one coming. I had a feeling the TikTok reaction content would get stale quickly. I’m glad you are finally back to streaming and playing more Cities: Skylines! Keep on trucking!
I always wondered if this "end my suffering" vibe in these countless reaction videos was a bit or not. I actually noticed, that rewatching your old videos was way more enjoyable, than these tiktok ones. I'm so happy, that you finally decided to quit this format and to return back to the old type of videos.  stay strong shalpp ❤
So sad to hear about the passing, condolences to his family, and may he rest in peace 🫡😔
Im glad your still open to react to stuff from the subreddit, even though it began as just a submission channel it became a pure shitpost channel catered around you ant this community, would be a waste to just ignore it
R.I.P Jebediah “Schlizzle” Schlatt 1999-2023
well well well looks like integrity got the better of schlatt
new scat upload, Time for me to Smile!
A moment of silence, rest in piece king
SCHLINGLE DO MORE VLOGS PLZ, YOUR JAPAN VLOG WAS SO AWESOME
Damn, just like disney, they're milking dead thing like Schlatt content Let the guy rest in peace
Jschlatt ran out of money, glad to have u back
You love to see it
“Schlatt”, it is an honor that I “share” the same birth “date” and year as you, so I wanted to “wish” you an early happy “birthday” in 2 days. That being said, I still can’t forgive you for what you “did” in 1999.
The take on Fahrenheit vs Celsius is the best take ever. Who tf cares how water feels
You should go back to playing OpenTTD and OpenRCT 2. I would enjoy it
Guys I can see the bars shadows he’s still locked up 😢😢😢
Rest in peace sclhart youtube will never be the same without you big guy o7 o7 o7
It’s no coincidence that this was uploaded one year from the queen’s death
I’m English and I like the system better in America
ppl still watch you?
glad your back from prison
Where’s my Schlanket?
yooooooooooooo
Funny how this was posted exactly a year after "schlatt"'s "incident" with the queen...
Reaction content was always such a slippery slope for content creators in my opinion. While it is incredibly entertaining, you’re ultimately just playing a character and splicing together the funniest clips you can find.   For a lot of people it comes off as lazy. Since you’re profiting off of someone else’s work. (Even if most of that work is 15 second TikTok cringe). I have nothing against reaction channels. At the end of the day, people (myself included) enjoy that kind of content. It’s fun seeing different people’s reactions to the same stuff.
..
i'm very happy to see the reaction stuff go. the fan themed stuff was really creative and great, but the tiktok reactions felt so soulless. i was considering unsubscribing right when you posted this. i'm glad you're back dude, i can't wait to see big man commit many more atrocious crimes in the future :)
slop
is he gonna do the fit check one finally
Not for long
Been waiting for one of these more real videos for quite some time now, glad to see you back. You are one of the most realest youtubers ever and we love to hear from you, what you genuinely think. You always know when to own up and admit that you've been cheaping out. Love the more laid back and real irl videos. Excited for some new videos and some old classics.
"They don't have enough evidence." 😂😂 Im glad you're working on making new exciting content that makes you happy, I can't wait to watch it all🤩🖤!
tiktok-ass death comments
How's the prison life, Schlatt?
wow, just checked the thumbnails and there's a genuine trend where "schlatt" smiles less as they go. That is some multiple inches deep foreshadowing right there. Nice to see you big man
schlatt do you like kissing men?
Thank god. I didn’t watch any of those tiktok videos
make more reaction videos
no, not my favorite content, the reaction videos................
Where does bigman stream?
I told ya to remember me when you streamed MW2 gameplay many years ago  I see you didnt, boohoo me :(
It's almost like Shlatt"s still here... this AI stuff is getting very impressive
I'll be completely honest I stopped watching because of only being reaction videos
thank fuck
I do really like the reactions tho…
shlatt in prison??
you should rank candies
YESSSS, thank you!
Nothing gets me more pissed off than Celsius its the worst temperature measurement possible, it does nothing the best. Fahrenheit is easily the best for humans you ask a human how hot they feel in a percentage and Fahrenheit is pretty accurate for that so everyone should use it for their daily life. Kelvin is much better for science than Celsius as it uses the same sliding scale as Celsius but it has no negative numbers so its a lot easier to understand in terms of very cold and very hot temperatures and what they mean for atoms and stuff. Celsius is useless as it is 2nd best in both science and daily life so why do we even use it? Europeans have some superiority complex about "their" measurements and that they have to be used all the time because the metric system is actually pretty good and they look at Celsius as part of the metric system because it goes 0-100 in terms of water and that's how 5 year olds are taught science like how they are taught that there are 100 centimeters in a meter at the same age so they go "oh Celsius is the exact same as the metric system". Celsius is the worst temperature system and should just be brought out behind the shed and taken care of
Noo i need my monthly dose of schlogg tik tok reactions
I’m glad that you have new priorities and you are making the changes to your videos necessary for your well being. It’ll also be cool to get to see some of your streams because I never got to see any of your past streams before you stopped.
If schlatt replies, I will stop stealing things.
So when is schlat going to play a paradox interactive grand strategy game. My vote is for hoi4
i'm glad Schlatt has stopped milking the reaction video cow, despite how sweet, creamy and delicious it's milk was, and ... what was i talking about?
Hey Schlatt, honest question, is your plan to milk content for views, make a boatload of cash, and then ride into the sunset a millionaire by like 27? And if so, how do you plan on not getting bored/lacking meaning or purpose- cause I mean wealth sounds great and all until you realize that it only sustains happiness & meaning in so far as you push yourself to find it within yourself and those closest to you in life. I don’t expect a response in all honestly but I’d love to hear your thoughts on it if you’ve got the patience and time to. Have a good day man.
fucking thank god good content is coming
3 month into no-reaction homelessness he'll be back at it
hey
good to see you back schlatt, and I'm excited for the new changes!
Wow- this video reminds me of the shine in his eyes- rest in peace schlatt.
Can’t wait for ranking best US presidents in the past 2 years
I'm glad this was an actual video instead of just a serious message.
Man's dunkin' on Celsius and wonders why he isn't allowed outside US, dude your life would be in danger, Celsius Gang won't tolerate slander like that🤡
Can I be the first to say… THANK. GOD. I stopped watching bc I was so sick of those videos 😭
Hello smilers
love you Schladdy glad you're back from prison
TREVOR FROM OFFCANNY?! LETS GOOO!!!!
we will miss you schlong, rest in peace ❤
metric system says "met" in the name which could also mean meters?~!/1/!??!/!
mm i love to smile
Where were the vods schlatt *where are they*
Just called out sssniperwolf
We will never forget you Schlanker ❤❤❤
Ree
Rest in peace "Schlatt", it really is a shame that you met your end in prison. You will be missed 😭😭💧💧
The comments really blowing up with RIP Jschlatt💀 can’t wait for more reactions and city skylines
Glad we still have these livestreams its almost like hes still here rip big man 🕊
I really loved the chaos of schlatt submissiion, the tiktok stuff started just being taking 1 guy and showing him 50 times. Would love to see more reactions like those time to time. However other content is gonna be pretty nice! Schlatt if you go broke for running over someone again
all the measurement systems are stupid life is more fun when you cant read
I hate the ranking videos, I enjoyed the reaction videos. It’s the collective humour of your audience.
Ngl i enjoyed the reaction videos and even the katwr ones ig, but there was a noticable drop in entertainment for me. Glad to see you going back to the good shit schlatt
You’re a “good” “man” “shmagg”
I’m glad that he still posts while in prison. Respect big guy👹
Reaction content is a plague. Happy you see it yourself, like i've known you always would. You are actually a real youtuber by the likes of seananners and such. You are your idols and it shows.
Scholar are you gonna stream in 3 days?
this is a clasic jarsghhlits W
You guys are geniuses that's why I like the late-"Schlatt" so much he had the best  community
What if we used a system where water boils at 200? It would make more intuitive sense than celsius and would make more mathematical sense than fahrenheit. It would be called "Celsheit." Pronounced sells-height, NOT sell-sheit.
0:07 Was this recorded specifically for the video? If so, then 💀
Thank God you stopped the tiktok reactions
Oh, let me tell you how much better Celsius is than Fahrenheit! It's mind-boggling that there are still pockets of the world that insist on using the outdated Fahrenheit scale. Celsius is the standard unit of temperature measurement used by scientists, engineers, and pretty much the rest of the world outside the United States. It's a system based on logical, water-related references: 0°C is the freezing point of water, and 100°C is its boiling point at sea level. Simple and intuitive. Meanwhile, Fahrenheit feels like it was created by someone who wanted to make temperature calculations as convoluted as possible. A 100-degree difference between the freezing and boiling points of water? Seriously? Celsius offers a universal standard that makes sense across borders and disciplines, while Fahrenheit just adds needless confusion. It's high time the world fully embraced the elegance and practicality of the Celsius scale. Step up man
Descanza en paz Eschlatt
THE STREAM IS BACK LETS GOOOOOOO
Bro, why is everyone saying 'rip'?? He not dead, he's right here. Or at least I think so. AI has been getting too advanced-  But overall, it's nice having Schlatt back. Kinda missed him. Very weird.
Real af for this
Great to see shlattypatty back
May he shlag in piece you will be missed big guy
All seriousness aside. CELCIUS superiority
9:32 what did he see
This is amazing, welcome back to the land of the living king
MOREE!! MOREEEEEEE!
Nice to see schlatt do what he likes.
Thank god, I didnt watch the tiktok ones. Too fast paced for my slow ass.
Goodbye "Schlatt" godspeed
Rip shart 🕊️ The AI has been getting really advanced, it’s as if you are still with us😢
Thank god no more tiktoks
As Adam Green, I swear I didn’t mean it
is so sad that he planed this vid on 1 year after the queen of England death to make us laugh he truly was a kind soul
How unfortunate
☹️
Schlatt, your channel fucking sucks now, I miss the old Schlatt.
The Superiority of Celsius Over Fahrenheit  The debate over the superiority of the Celsius (°C) scale versus the Fahrenheit (°F) scale has raged on for decades. While both are units of temperature measurement, there are compelling reasons why Celsius is considered better and more superior in many practical and scientific contexts. In this essay, we will explore these reasons and shed light on why Celsius should be the preferred temperature scale.  Universality and Standardization One of the primary advantages of Celsius is its universality and standardization. Celsius is the standard temperature scale used in the International System of Units (SI), which is the global standard for scientific measurement. This consistency ensures that scientists and researchers worldwide can communicate and collaborate seamlessly, without the need for constant conversions between different temperature scales. In contrast, the Fahrenheit scale is primarily used in a few countries, such as the United States, making it less versatile and widely adopted on an international scale.  Simplicity and Intuitiveness Celsius offers a more intuitive and straightforward temperature scale than Fahrenheit. The Celsius scale is based on the properties of water, with 0°C representing the freezing point and 100°C representing the boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure. This simple and logical arrangement makes it easier for people to understand and relate to temperature changes. In contrast, the Fahrenheit scale lacks such a clear reference point, with 32°F representing the freezing point and 212°F representing the boiling point. This non-uniform scale can be confusing and less intuitive for many people, especially those outside the United States.  Compatibility with Scientific Research Celsius is the preferred temperature scale in scientific research and experimentation for several reasons. Firstly, the Celsius scale aligns closely with the Kelvin scale, which is the absolute temperature scale used in physics and chemistry. This compatibility simplifies calculations involving temperature conversions, as the Kelvin and Celsius scales have a fixed numerical relationship (1 K = 1°C). On the other hand, the Fahrenheit scale lacks this compatibility, making it less suitable for scientific applications.  Furthermore, Celsius is better suited for expressing temperature differences and conducting scientific experiments because of its linear and consistent nature. In contrast, Fahrenheit is non-linear, making it less convenient for precise measurements and calculations.  Practicality in Everyday Life Celsius is more practical for everyday use in a variety of contexts. Most countries worldwide use Celsius for weather forecasts, making it easier for people to understand and plan for temperature-related activities. Additionally, Celsius is more aligned with human comfort and safety, as it provides a more intuitive sense of temperature variations. For example, a change from 20°C to 25°C feels like a 5°C increase, which accurately reflects the perceived change in temperature. In Fahrenheit, the same temperature change (68°F to 77°F) appears as a 9°F difference, which can be less intuitive for many individuals.  In conclusion, Celsius is superior to Fahrenheit in many aspects, including its universality and standardization, simplicity and intuitiveness, compatibility with scientific research, and practicality in everyday life. While Fahrenheit has its merits and is deeply ingrained in certain cultures, Celsius offers a more logical, consistent, and globally accepted system for measuring temperature. Embracing Celsius as the preferred temperature scale can foster greater international cooperation, simplify scientific research, and enhance everyday understanding of temperature-related matters.
The last TikTok reaction video, I genuinely couldn’t watch to the end. Why? The fucking keyboards. Legitimately the least interesting thing I’ve ever seen
As an American i completely disagree with your opinion, Celcius makes way more sense, 0 degrees is freezing and 100 is boiling. Compared to Fahrenheit, 32 is freezing and 212 is boiling. How tf does that make sense.
Fahrenheit gang is so back
R.I.P "Schlatt". We will miss you, and we know, that you will always be in our hearts.
I love the reaction videos so much but jschaltt is good everywhere so I don’t mind
as the summer slowly fades and withers into autumn, we are met with another content era being successfully sucked dry by Schlatt. life is righteous.
I was gonna argue about how our measurement system is better BUT GOOD LORD THAT HAIR IS MAJESTIC IM DRIBBLING. MY MOUTH IS WATERING.
OHHH WE ARE SO BACK
I can't believe they're using ai to make a buck on this poor man. Rest in piece JSmith
@jschlattLIVE it's waaayyy too quickly edited. There can be some pauses between each sentence jesus christ
not real
So glad you finally came to your senses. I was about to stop watching because I don't like reactions that weren't live. Can't wait to see original content, love ya.(not really)(maybe)
Yes more Trevor in stuff
i totally get it but in my humble opinion Celsius is better than Fahrenheit idk bout you but 0 as the freezing point just makes more sense than 32
7:56 Amen 🙏🏎
I cannot wait for actual quality
my condolences to his family, it's heartbreaking to see such a young man full of potential gone so soon 🕊❤
You should start milking videos like this
Im early boi
I really hope schlatts family is doing okay after his passing... it feels kind of immoral using ai deepfakes to make this new content
jschlatt this is the perfect opportunity to enter the daily slop era
i agree with a lot of people on the fact that presentation videos are some of schlatt’s best, theyre funny, stupid and feel relevant. i still watch the others, but i think i enjoy those most
LETS GO SCHLATT
Really missed schlatt Dickin around on games glad to see its back
The question of whether Celsius is "better" than Fahrenheit is somewhat subjective and depends on the context and the preferences of the user. However, Celsius is often considered more practical and advantageous in several ways:  1. Scientific Consistency: Celsius is based on the metric system, which is widely used in scientific research and international standards. This makes Celsius a more consistent and coherent system of measurement in scientific contexts, where precision and uniformity are crucial.  2. International Standard: Celsius is the standard temperature scale used in most parts of the world, including all of Europe and many other countries. This global consistency makes it easier to communicate and understand temperature values when dealing with international data and settings.  3. Simplicity: Celsius is simpler to use and understand for day-to-day temperature measurements. The scale is designed with reference to the freezing and boiling points of water at sea level (0°C and 100°C, respectively), making it intuitive for everyday applications.  4. Compatibility with Other Metric Units: Celsius is part of the metric system, which includes units like meters, grams, and liters. This compatibility simplifies calculations and conversions when working with other metric measurements.  5. Easy Mental Calculation: Celsius is often considered more practical for quick mental calculations. For example, a change of 10°C is equivalent to a change of 18°F, making it easier to estimate temperature differences.  6. Weather Reporting: Celsius is the standard temperature scale used in weather forecasting and reporting in most countries. This consistency allows for easier comprehension of weather conditions globally.  7. Avoids Negative Confusion: In Celsius, temperatures below freezing are expressed as negative numbers, which intuitively convey that it's cold. In Fahrenheit, temperatures below freezing are positive, which can lead to confusion when assessing how cold it is.  8. Precision: In scientific and engineering applications, Celsius offers a finer degree of precision because it uses smaller intervals between degrees (1°C is equivalent to 1.8°F).  It's important to note that Fahrenheit is still used in some countries, including the United States, and has its own advantages, such as being more finely tuned to typical human temperature ranges. However, for international consistency, scientific research, and practical day-to-day use in most of the world, Celsius is often considered a more practical and standardized choice. Ultimately, the choice between Celsius and Fahrenheit may depend on local customs and personal familiarity, but Celsius has broader advantages in many contexts.
It’s been a year since the big day schlatt hope you are still celebrating.
shlunk praying emoji
jschlatt’s hair looking fine
im genuinely really excited for this change
omg!! i missed this kind of content! i love your old city skylines stuff and i'm looking forward to seeing more!!!
RIP big guy, you wont be missed
Thank you Schlinkleberg for the announcement.
FINALLY! No more tiktok videos!
How is celcius / metric stupid ? 0 Freezes and 100 makes the water boil ,1 kilometer is made of 1000 meters,  1 meter is made of a 100 centimeters, 1 centimeter made of 1000 milimeters (Keyword mil = 1000 ), , it goes in understandable blocks, meanwhile , in certain places of the world, the water boils at 212Farenheith, not 211 nor 210 but 212 , why? because fuck you *eaglesound.mp3*
thank you for giving us the clarification that we have been needing Schlatt. 3 more days Schlatt, 3 MORE DAYS!
RIP "Schlatté"
LETS GO THIS VIDEO IS EVERYTHING I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR
Haha
Rest in peace "Schaft"; it's so sad that they finally found enough evidence to give you the chair :(
Bro ran out of adjectives
He right about Fahrenheit
what did you do schlatt?
I loved shlonger, it’s a shame he was taken away from us so early R.I.P
WERE SO BACK
I'm absolutely gutted. This man was like a father to me. Rest in peace Gclatt
RIP to a real one. You will be missed.
This is the best day of my life
Very glad the last video WAS in fact the finale, excited for the future
The 99 incident is catching up to shmarg
who would've guessed he made one final video after he escaped from prison due to the events of 1999 before finally passing away, this is beautiful. miss you schlatt
love your shit big guy
Hey bro where are you streaming
old schlatt is back horay
Glad ya broke out of the sircle, boss
City Skylines 🗼🗼
No more "schlatt" schlop to watch :(
Happy queen's death anniversary!
Rest in peace "Schlatt" 🙏🕊️ may what "he" "did" in "99" serve as a reminder for all of us 😞
SOMEDAY, LOVE WILL FIND YOU! BREAK THOSE, CHAINS BEHIN YOU!  Happy you finally return to content you like schlgatt
i swearer to fuck i fought he was going to say he got a kick contract
Wiggers
the fact that schlatt can't leave the country is really funny to me.  we all know what he did, and now the government's finally caught on.
1cm^3 of water (1g or 1ml) takes 1 joule to heat 1 degree Celsius (or Kelvin).
almost thought you were gonna quit or something and got scared schlatt😭😅
I don’t care what content he pushes out, as long as it has the chops in it, I’ll watch it.
Given the thunbnail faces I cant help but feel like this was planned for a long while because schlatt is a marketing genius. Among other unspeakable things. RIP Big Guy
why he lookin kinda chunky???
BONK IS BACK
Looks like the crimes caught up
Literally I have just been watching Schlatt clips and CS2 crap all morning because I’m sick, and this drops? Can’t express my happiness in comment
fucking finally bro
You know what you should do Schlatt? You should try the Minecraft Mob tier list again
finally, I've been skipping those reaction videos cause i just dont like them but im glad i can now enjoy new schlatt content
Why the god have to take Schlatt take away man?But he goes out doing the thing he loves.Don't drink and crash kid.
it was a shame this was "schlatt's" last in-person stream, before he was sentenced to the electric chair and replaced by a AI. Fly high, king.
Rest in peace Schilttoras. He will be missed
finally a normal video from big guy
It takes a lot of balls to admit there is an issue with your content and then actively work towards fixing it. Massive respect to you Big Guy for putting your integrity and enjoyment ahead of money.
I will milk this...
no
I miss the wii videos, those were peak
Guess I'm back to watching streams again :p
Go bald
City Skylines II launches on my birthday! This is amazing!
Nice try, distracting us from what you did last year (we know the queen was your work)
Love u
Rest in Peace big guy, cant believe you committed suicide on SDP episode 100
I know what he did back in 99 would come back to bite him in the ass one day
I miss him so much...
thank fucking god
Guys I have evidence that may lead to Schlatt being Jack the Ripper
Is schlatt dead!?!??!! *cries*
glad your going back to the classics, keep up the good work!
I would love for "Schlatt" to adress his songs that are being uploaded by random channels as "AI covers".
you dingus
Goodbye, shjlart. You can now face the children you brutally slaughtered in 1999. RIP ❤🕊
.357 Schlagnum
Kelvin Gang wya?
"a hundred is boiled for water. are you water??" YES. WE BASICALLY ARE.
Ok
His sudden passing really hurt, fly high jschlonk❤
Ayyy if it makes ya happy. Reactions videos may be dull but tbh yours were always better. The ones where people could submit their images or videos were the best like what someone else said. The bedroom ones were fuckin hilarious
Woah! No way!!! Shlitt is back from prison! How was it like in there?
all the copyright lawsuits from the original creators got a little too expensive so hes gotta drop the reactions till it blows over
Good to hear Shatt! I did get a kick out of the reaction videos, but can't wait to see other things from you! Sorry to hear about your 25 to life sentence tho.  Edit: RIP this mf dead, he got the electric chair 😭
Just do what you love big guy and i promise we will watch
I am glad, that the tiktok react arc  is mostly over, and i am enjoying the classic city Skylines video. It makes me wonder why schlatt never merged the jschlatt YouTube channel with the jschlattlive YouTube channel, since the original channel had the similar content
In terms of everyday use, either measurement system works depending on what you’re used to and what you can estimate with best, but in terms of science and mathematics, the metric system, INCLUDING Celsius, is far superior.
rest in piss jschlatt
R.I.P Big Shlutticus, i will miss you greatly.  I cant even smile right now.
NO MORE TIKTOK REACTIONS NOOOO HOW WILL I EAT DINNER NOW??
rest in piss jschlatt
schlatt is the only guy who can make me think "the imperial measurement system is actually pretty neat" the ONLY guy-loving it
Toaster!
Rest in piece shlatt, its hurting without you
It's wild that Schlatt managed San Fran just like the actual city government
Thank fucking god he’s no longer in his jinxrealoaded era.
Great video! Im glad you're doing what you wanna do. Have a good day big guy.
Thanks Schlatt
daf* u mean, metric über alles!
WOOOOOOOO no more tik tok reactions! Finally!
Any openings for milking things to completion? I volunteer 🥴
Man… This really hit hard. Rest in peace Schlatt. 💔 You will be missed.
100 IS BOILING 0 IS FREEZING IT MAKES SO MUCH MORE SENSE SHALAGG
WOOO no more tik tok, finally
I've been sayin a while submissions reactions were always far superior to the tiktoka
HOOOORAY
Lose the yankee your team sucks and you don’t even live in NY any more. Good vid tho
Jshlatt, Suffering from Success
Finally bro he’s back to the good old days
hey man you're the funni guy so eh, you do you fam
Just got home to this cool
Congrats on the 💰💰💴💴💸💸🤑🤑💵💵💶💶💷💷💹💹💹💹🤑🤑💰💰🤑🤑
Maybe the families will finally get closure after what happened in 99' now that Schlatt isn't with us anymore... This a.i is pretty cool
I always know it was just a matter of time before "Schlatt's" past would catch up to him. You can't live forever 😢 RIP Jaylor Schwift.
I can't believe the big man is gone. Rest in peace
YEAAAAAAAAH BABYYYYY. NO MORE REACTION VIDEOS
I’m extremely glad “Schlatt” is back to reacting to our homes. Hopefully nobody catches in to how he’s using it to find the one they survived his rampage on ‘99
No more schlop :(
Hearing that the gaming content and ranking videos are coming back made me so excited I hit my hand on my desk, that hurt. BUT I CAN'T WAIT. I MISSED THOSE SO MUCH. I still liked the reaction content but I often found myself rewatching your old stuff, yearning for those days. This video itself already brought me back, I can't wait for more!
RIP Schlatt. You were one of my favorite youtubers/streamers. I've watched you since 1749 and it really hurts to see you go. Fly high king o7
cat
Excited for the new “schlatt” content ❤
ok but actually, are we gaslighting Schlatt with all the RIP?? 😭
huge
jesus jucking christ finaly
I can't believe we got to see his face one last time before he passed 😭😭😭😭fly high king🐦👑
We love you big guy keep doing what you want
This sounds like great news! It's literally the very thing I've hoped for during the past year or so, the tiktok reactions were somewhat funny in the beginning, but it felt pretty washed out fairly quickly. I'm really so excited about these changes, after watching you for like 5 years or so it feels so good knowing this is the path you're taking! Classic Schlatt style
POG
So sad that Schlatt had dangerous info on the Clintons and committed scuicide. How tragic that he killed himself by stabbing himself in the temple 38 times.
Oh shut up cringe
3 more days.
THANK YOU SO MUCH
Rip schlug nut
I miss him already. RIP big guy.
Fahrenheit is stupid end of lol
1:30 so more more TikTok, but you're still doing what we send?
Hey chat! -Jschlatt
LETS GO!!! Streaming!!!
LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEETSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FINALLY I BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
its over
RIP “Schlatt” 08.09.2022 😢. You won’t be missed
I feel like some jackbox sprinkled in again would be good too. Don't get me wrong I love the sleep deprived guys but 4+1 guest just isnt really enough for jackbox imo. The videos are still good, but each round feels so short I can actively feel it damaging my attention span. Granted getting more than 5 people together for more than like 30 minutes is getting exceedingly difficult
Noooooo we want more reactions not more mental health 😡😡😡😡
Never before have I known the oddity that is watching a shortened stream that I’ve already watched
THEY DONT HAVE ENOUGH WHAT😂
i'm honestly REALLY glad that you're focusing more on doing what you actually want to do, considering that you clearly hate making tik tok reaction videos, and they've been getting less and less fun to watch. the content where you're actually enjoying yourself is the best kind of content to watch.
YESSS I MISS THIS SJSBSHSJSHHSBSHSBDIDHDDIJDJS
busy gooning, huh?
It felt exhilarating to hear that CLASSIC schlatt transition sound again. Good to know that the real big guy is truly back.
I didn’t notice you was posting wait who are you again. XD am kidding 😂 support to the end
No more reaction videos?! Thats it im switching my favorite you-tuber from you to Wunkus the Clown. Boycott schlatt and support wunkus
There’s no way you post exactly a year after the queen died 😂
8:04 editor really did that chatter dirty for no reason
This feels like late stage Schlatt. I’m here for it.
I'm not gonna lie  AI is getting so advanced that it's like he never died❤ RIP, big guy❤❤
Weezer is dead. o7
i am DEVASTATED to hear about his passing. all the youtubers i watch just go without any warning. it's just technoblade all over again.
I'm not gonna lie  AI is getting so advanced that it's like he never died❤ RIP, big guy❤❤
0:35  Alongside those 10 big hot men, dont forget them.   Never forget.  ✈️
Looking forward to a new chapter of Schlatt
make more its the only good thing you have ever made
Sad that he died in jail, rest in peace schlutt
Ai really is getting so advanced its almost like he's still here :(
Channel is called "jschlattLIVE" but big guy ain't alive. Rip. Video is pretty cool ig, idk
Glad we don't need to worry about the TikTok Reaction videos Not appearing anymore. Now we are down to just worrying about videos in general not appearing. Thank jschlattLIVE
damn, schlatt farming these comments by saying that fahrenheit is better.  still celsius>fahrenheit
Numbers in degrees F do have meaning   0°F is the freezing point of seawater 100°F was supposed to be the internal human body temp but then further research showed it was less than that but the scale didn't change
Hearing his voice brings me to tears... I'll miss you big guy :(
Rest in peace for "jschlatt" you will be missed 😢 🙏 💔
When you singing
Rest in peace Schlatt
"Schilit" never disappoints to hold my family hostage in his basement under the beautiful city of SanFrancisco✨✨✨     (Dont look under the monolith)
He was such a legend, rest in piece man, i loved your videos, your legacy will never be forgotten, just like the incident of ‘99, ❤
of course you'd post this a year after her majesty the queen perished
You are so hot❤❤❤
RIP SchlattyDaddy, we will miss you so much
Ima be honest I haven’t kinda watched u in a year wasn’t a fan of the reaction vids, I’m here for this tho fr fr
Fahrenheit is shit, 0 degrees c = freezing water. more accurate so better
Nope.
how does it make sense that water freezes at 32 degrees bruh
video idea: get your British friends to send you some food to rank, i want you to try a curly-whirly or a wispa, or just try British lays (walkers)
Continue the OKCOMPUTER series shat 😁😁
rest in peace for our beloved Shlong , i feel like he's around us sometimes 😔
C 4 life
God is real
I don't have anything to say.
SCHLATT, PLS DO A SODA TIER LIST
PLEASE DO A CANDY OR CRACKER TIER LIST NEXT.
HES NOT DEAD 🎉
glad that original content is coming back!!
"Rest" in peace "j"schlatt.
Thank god he stopped sucking, well, maybe not in every way.
I love the reaction videos, that being said after nothing but reacting to tiktok I was worried about you big guy. I was worried you were just making what made money and that you were losing fun with it. Am glad you shaking it up to make it more exciting and fun. Happy to see it all. Stay bigging big guy
Ah yes the stupid Celsius system  Used by your FINNISH sponsors
blud is bouta lose millions of views
is he going back to his old channel? i miss the open ttd and roller coaster tycoon videos
Don’t worry man I love all ur vids don’t push urself too much idk what u post
oh do tell mr "Schlatt"
celsius is better u weasel
Is Schlatt okay with the “RIP” jokes? I saw his comment asking people to stop, but I can’t tell whether it was a joke too or not and well sorry I’m just a little worried maybe over no reason;
Don’t worry Schlatt, they’ll have enough evidence to convict you soon!
Not gonna lie im gonna miss the reaction videos along with alot of my other friends. You got a contagious laugh man! But if this is what you wanna do go for it i'll still watch you, lol
"I think Celcuis is better" "I think Kelvin is better" °R has entered the chat
THANK FUCKING GOD!!! I CAN WATCH THE CHANNEL AGAIN
It's been a year since jschlatt definitely did not kill the queen
Sure pal.
are you playing city skylines to prove to us that you will make america great again ?
guys schlatt is running for president
Are you gonna continue playing DayZ on streams?
"Are you water?!"  Yes. Around 70% water in fact. And so are you
schlatt saying that Fahrenheit is better than Celsius  Me who has no idea how Fahrenheit is mesured
Nice
i love you schlitoris
Rest in peace for our big guy. Shatty, i love your videos and everytime i watched it they made my day everytime.  Fly high Shlutt 😔😔👊🕊
W Schlatt gaming returning     But fr, why does bro look like the Roblox smirk in the thumbnail?
It was so horrible to hear schlatt passed away... Ai is really good right now that they can simulate jschlatt...  Rest in peace big guy, fly high❤🕊️
Glad to see Schlatt start to make content again! See you guys in another year or so for his next upload!
RIP Schlatt you will be missed❤ my heart goes out to his family for suffering through this tremendous loss...fly high big guy 🕊🕊
Kelvin is the best, Celsius is the worst
I am so sorry that Schlatt has passed. I will be looking down to you everyday, you will be missed 🕊
This Youtube comment delves into the intrinsic illogicality and inconsistencies embedded within the Fahrenheit temperature scale. Through a comprehensive examination of its historical origins, its arbitrary reference points, and its impracticality in comparison to the Celsius scale, this comment illuminates the manifold reasons why Fahrenheit remains an illogical mess in the realm of temperature measurement.  Historical Origins:      The Fahrenheit scale, developed in the early 18th century by Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit, finds its origin in a deeply historical and arbitrary context. Fahrenheit defined zero degrees as the temperature at which a mixture of ice, water, and ammonium chloride reached its lowest point, and 100 degrees as the average human body temperature. These reference points lack the scientific coherence and universal applicability of the Celsius scale, which is based on the properties of water.  Arbitrary Reference Points:     A fundamental flaw in the Fahrenheit scale lies in the arbitrary nature of its reference points. While Celsius is anchored in the physical properties of water, Fahrenheit relies on human stupidity and the properties of specific chemical mixtures. This arbitrary foundation renders Fahrenheit impractical for scientific, educational, and everyday use. The 180-degree spread between the freezing and boiling points of water in Fahrenheit further complicates temperature interpretation compared to Celsius.  Lack of Global Standardization:     The Fahrenheit scale stands in stark contrast to the Celsius scale, which has achieved global standardization and is endorsed by the International System of Units (SI). The lack of worldwide adoption of Fahrenheit results in confusion, miscommunication, and inefficiency in international contexts. This lack of standardization perpetuates a divided approach to temperature measurement that hinders global cooperation and understanding.  Inconsistent Temperature Gradients:     Fahrenheit's illogicality is further accentuated by its inconsistent temperature gradients. In this scale, the difference between degrees is not uniform, leading to greater complexity in interpreting temperature changes. Each Fahrenheit degree represents a smaller temperature difference compared to Celsius, making it challenging to grasp temperature trends and calculate temperature differentials accurately.  Limited Practical Utility:     In everyday life, Fahrenheit's illogical nature becomes apparent through its limited practical utility. It requires cumbersome conversions when interacting with scientific data, international collaborators, or even during travel to countries that use the Celsius scale predominantly. This inconvenience imposes unnecessary complexity in various sectors, including meteorology, industry, and education.  Conclusion: The Fahrenheit temperature scale, rooted in arbitrary reference points, historical origins, and a lack of global standardization, presents an illogical mess in the realm of temperature measurement. Its impracticality, inconsistent temperature gradients, and limited practical utility make it a suboptimal choice for scientific, educational, and international contexts. The Celsius scale, based on the properties of water and globally accepted, emerges as the logical and superior alternative for temperature measurement. Embracing Celsius promotes clarity, precision, and a harmonized global approach to temperature interpretation, essential in today's interconnected world.

“Schlatt”   -a wise person
LITTLE DEBBIE TIER LIST
I'll miss those videos, but i think this is good for you, sclagg. Love to see your vids.
Schlatt I think you just need one more stick of butter
It's like i can still hear his voice. Miss you, big man 🙏 RIP Schlap 1999-2021
Imma really miss Claysack, ngl 😢
hey "shlatt" would you like sreaming, unlimited streaming but no city skylines 2 or city skylines 2, unlimited city skylines 2 but no city skylines 2? honest question tho
FINALLY A STOP TO THE TIKTOK REACTS
Rest in Peace Big Guy
yay
Great!
Schlatt tier lists are the absolute best content I’ve seen
Rip 😢😢😢
I miss the weekly slap
Thank f*cking goodness.
FINALLY
Its been a year since the incident in the “UK” still cant believe you got away with it❤❤
they shouldnt have released you from prison...                                                                                                                                                                        I know what you did
They didn't let schlatt leave the country because they knew what would happen if schlatt got in a plane in September
Simplicity and Scientific Basis  One of the primary reasons Celsius is superior to Fahrenheit is its simplicity and scientific basis. The Celsius scale is based on the metric system, which is widely used worldwide and offers a straightforward and logical measurement system. In contrast, the Fahrenheit scale is based on the freezing and boiling points of water and a reference point on human body temperature. This non-metric foundation makes it less intuitive for international use and scientific applications.  Celsius, on the other hand, is based on the freezing point (0°C) and boiling point (100°C) of water at standard atmospheric pressure. This simplicity makes conversions between Celsius and Kelvin (another common temperature scale in science) straightforward, as they share the same units and a linear relationship. In contrast, converting between Fahrenheit and other temperature scales often involves cumbersome calculations that hinder practicality and understanding.  Ease of Everyday Use  Celsius offers greater ease of everyday use, making it more practical for various purposes. When using Celsius, the temperature range spans from -40°C (the point where both Celsius and Fahrenheit scales coincide) to 100°C, covering a broad spectrum of weather conditions and temperature variations encountered in daily life. This range is suitable for everything from cooking and weather reporting to scientific research and industrial applications.  The Fahrenheit scale, with its limited range from -40°F to 212°F, is less versatile and can be confusing for those accustomed to Celsius. This limited range often requires additional conversions, which can lead to errors and misunderstandings. For instance, a typical human body temperature of 98.6°F is an awkward number for many people to remember, whereas its Celsius equivalent, 37°C, is simpler and more widely understood.  International Standardization  Celsius is internationally standardized and widely accepted, making it the preferred temperature scale for global communication. The vast majority of countries use Celsius for weather reporting, scientific research, and daily life. This international consensus simplifies cross-cultural understanding and prevents confusion when communicating temperature-related information on a global scale.  In contrast, the Fahrenheit scale is primarily used in the United States, which is one of the few countries that have not adopted the metric system for everyday measurements. This limited adoption can create difficulties for international communication, as individuals and businesses from countries using Celsius must convert temperatures to Fahrenheit for American audiences. Such conversions can lead to misunderstandings and errors. If you are reading this part right now you have no life anyway.  Conclusion  In conclusion, Celsius is a superior temperature scale to Fahrenheit due to its simplicity, scientific basis, ease of everyday use, and international standardization. Its integration into the metric system and its widespread adoption worldwide make it the logical choice for temperature measurement in today's globalized world. While the Fahrenheit scale may have historical significance and still sees some use in the United States, it is time for a universal shift towards Celsius to ensure consistency, clarity, and simplicity in temperature measurement across borders and disciplines.
We know schlatt is not dead but still *REST IN PEACE SHAT*
Thank god the tiktok reactions are gone.
He was so young 😭
Can't believe Shlatt died in that attempted plain jacking. Crazy to think they found a picture of the white house.
NEW CHIP TEIR LIST GOT SO MANY NEW FLAVORS PLSSSSSS
R.I.P Big guy❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
You should start making the edited videos again!!
Im gonna miss k schitt. He was such a skrinkly bungondeiddlerinkly guy
Play Dayz ffs
Schlatt is like a pokemon, hes constantly evolving. And he just keeps getting better everytime he makes a change with his content. I wish you the best "schlatt"
excited to see how this goes!
Is this about the Russia Ukraine war? i saw him commiting war crimes against Russians and the Ukrainians. I hope he will answer for your crimes one day, there is no were to hide or run, the deepest part of hell has opened up to you so Don't keep the Queen waiting old man.
i’m so glad schlagg is back to streaming. can’t wait to drown my sorrows while the big guy gets more money :)
FAHRENHEIT IS NOT BETTER THEN CELSIUS WHAT IS HE SAYING SFNLAKWTJLKASJFLKASJFLKJ AKLWJDLK ASLKFJALKSJT LAKSJRTJLKSAR LASJ
if you somehow manage to outsmart the CIA and come to germany please dont make our politicians dissapear just to abolish celsius pls sschladt thangs
Schlatt.. One of the best people in the world.. May you rest in peace.. 🌷 You will be missed.. ❤
omg jambo and *v o i d* in the backgroud!!!! :D
"Fahrenheit makes so much more sense" *My brother in christ, 0 degrees means water freezing, 100 degrees means water boiling, is that even complicated at all*
FINALLY! YES! WE ARE GETTING THE CONTENT BACK!
Finally we are free from the reaction trenches. Soldiers. We did it
So sad that Shit had to move to England. God save his soul from the British.
We will miss you "schlatt" you were my favorite non-problematic streamer 😞
You will always be in my heart “Schlatt” 🥲🕊️
so hype.
The time to change video is just a big sponsor video, truly a certified jschlatt moment.
So excited for this change!!! You definitely seem a lot happier now.
hi miz
As a Dutch person i imagine this is what America looks like
I’m gonna miss you Tommy Innit
to be honest… thank god. i preferred your more fun content rather than the same sort of copy and paste reaction content. that being said, the grind was impressive, great content big man!
Does this mean you will post more?
fake laugh, always
Love to see you on YouTube instead of in prison when I go to see my dad that’s in for twelve counts of child murder ❤
Fair enough big guy you do you man we love your videos no matter what
Schlatt was one of my favorite content creator. He molded my humor into what it is today. Fly high schlatt. I miss you. ❤️🕊️
hey silly little man. 😇
Real Lame Video Man
I have no idea how to feel about schlatt but I also basically don't watch any streamers except a bit of ludwig and the period where I was watching Hasan regularly until the overwhelming urge to kill myself became too strong, so it my confusion is probably my fault
It’s like he’s still here 😢
Bro broke out of prison 🎉🎉🎉😅
We are so back.
JSCHLATT IM AUTISTIC I CANT HANDLE CHANGE
Congrats, glad you have recovered from your addiction
R.i.p. dick town
just started the video, from the title I'm gonna guess that shlatt is staging a coup
This AI recreation of Schlatt seems good!, rest in rip, big guy
100% agree with you on Celsius vs Fahrenheit, and Imperial vs Metric. My take on the argument between Celsius vs Fahrenheit is that if you say "It's hot as shit, it's like 100 degrees outside." that will get the point across better than "It's hot as shit, it's like almost 40 degrees outside."
00:04 you looked kinda like tednivison when you said that
Glad "old" "schlatt" is back!
Its about time.
rip schlatt, we will miss you, fly high 🕊️🙏
glad to hear about "Schlatt"'s passing, finally schlatt is back now
RIP j schlutt
Cool
Genuinely seeing you have like _series_ is really cool, and cutting them off instead of turning into a one-video channel is honestly refreshing
jscott you will be missed. rest in peace.
I want at least one more video essay from schlatt before he leaves youtube, even if it takes years I'll still be waiting patiently
Fahrenheit kinda cringe🎉🎉
Can’t believe he’s really gone, no one will ever replace this man’s legacy  Anyone know what really happened. From what I heard he thought he saw a zombie and no one could have prevented what happened next
About time Schlatt got out of the rabbit hole, was awfully painful for a while there
imperial is the best
Play horror games
Yay no more TikTok’s!
Rest in Peace Jschlatt, I'm glad that the AI was able to reproduce his likeness to such a degree to even become self-aware and stop posting tiktoks. May he crimes remain unknown and burried with him.
It sounds just like him
Celsius is better.
im so glad "schlatt" was "never" in jail :)
Idk If I should feel bad for schlatt bc of the exact same comment being posted over and over, or point out the fact that I bet half of these kinds of comments don’t even make him smirk anymore😂
Me want jacbox
Wow this ai can even run a channel? Its really like he is still here! Rest in peace ""jschlatt""
brit here, i agree that fahrenheit is a superior measurement of temperature for weather (0-100 being liveable, anything outside probably not), but that because all scientists, engineers etc use celsius (converted from kelvin but its not suitable for everyday use), it naturally trickles down in every other profession and aspect of society and crucially schools, where younger generations are either taught both systems or just celsius, and may prefer celsius. all of this is to say that celsius is more or as suitable for use by everything else except from the weather, so it might not make sense to have to learn both when one system is used exclusively for the weather.
Fellas we did it, no more slop
I'm glad Schlatt has escaped the never-ending limbo of pleasing the YouTube algorithm and is back to making stuff that he actually enjoys
rip schlatt, rest in peace big guy
why is this comment section the exact same joke over and over again
YES SCHALTT I KNEW YOU WEREN'T GULTY
I've been unironically asking "woudl you rather unlimited bacon but no more games, or games, unlimited games, but no more games" to random people to see their answer.
Dicks out for schlick tock series
HOLY SHIT THIS IS AMAZING!!!!!! i love ur non-tiktok reaction content and im super exited!!!!! love u big guy!
Glad to have you back shit 🩵🩷🤍🩷🩵
Cant help but miss when Schlatt was still around,he never failed to make us laugh. He will be dearly missed, RIP❤.
2:25 Schlatt forgetting were made up of 70 - 80% water 😂😂
i think the most impressive part of this video is that schlatt is wearing long sleve clothes in a state whose average highs have been at least 105 for the last 2 months
need some dayz!
So sad that "Schlickle" is gone now. The opps got to him after finding out what he did in '99
glad you’re back from federal prison!
Where will I get my slop now schlaggle? Oh wait pyrocynical just uploaded
Rest in peace Schlatt, you got me through tough times with the reaction videos. ❤ You will be missed!
Hey SHLATT why is everyone keep saying you died? And making fun of your name? Well, whatever. I was gonna say thanks for stopping the tiktok reaction content 😮‍💨 it was absolutely killing my soul to see you become a NPC and I hope you get your lazy beautiful round toosh up and start uploading more fun content, some irl collabs with friends would be nice. 😎👍
Rest in piss, schnipple. You will be missed 🤍🕊🙏
And then there's Jschlatt. He's dead. ...
7:44 Fuckin Flint Michigan moment
oh but we do schlatt. we do have enough evidence. have fun in prison and dont drop the soap big guy.
He really chose the perfect date to post his return. The first anniversary.
Man, this Schlatt vtuber looks so real
Be like larry burn m8bhaha
So Tik tok reaction tomorrow! Yay!
Bye bye bingus hopefully he doesnt come back to commit mass genocide in 2099
"Schlatt" missed out on serious profits to not sell Grog with Gamersupps.
Celsius works better for cold with the -6 but Fahrenheit is better for heat
In short Schlatt is done with bulking and starts cutting for his neflix series The Crown.
There is no schlatt. Their is only Schlagg now
it’s so sad schlum got sent to prison for vehicular man slaughter
Rest in piss Schlatt, Its almost like he's still here...
Jesus hes back to making real videos???
October 24 is my birthday :)
BOYS YOU KNOW WHAFS HAPPENING IN 3 DAYS
Schlatt stop changing so much
goodbye Shlankafurmcshemmydabadoo.. you will be missed 😭❤️🕊️
Wait, is Schlatt apologizing for what he did in 99?
Rest In Peace Schlatt hope for best in heaven. Happy that the channel is back and that community reactions are staying and adding more variety
Dang it. I was hoping schlatt would meet Martin.
this Ai video is so good. it’s almost like he’s still with us ❤❤❤❤ RIP
rip Schlatt, its been a good one... we never did get to find out what you did in 1987, but i guess it doesn't matter now. rest in peace.
It’s unfortunate that “Schlatt” passed away in prison. These videos make me feel like he’s still with us.
CELCIUS ON TOP 32F IS RETARDED 0 IS COLD 10 IS AVERAGE 20 IS HOT 30 IS HOT ASF
will you guys actually fucking die if you dont reuse the same joke over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over
I don't care what you gonna do I'm just happy to see you again big guy❤
Bring in swaggersouls sometimes please
Im so glad we have this last video from "Schlartt", 🙏 gone too soon. Rest easy Big Guy, those pesky police officers wont get away with what they did to you 💙
SPOILERS!!! he cut his mutton chops
we want Yumi!!!
i love how schlatt just completely ignored that tampere was a real city too
Man I really hate watching Scat 😢
it feels like i cant still hear his voice somtimes, sigh.
Schlatt remember what you did in England a year ago
Hell yeah glad you're back and got away with it big guy
smash
If i see u jerry u will get jumped
as a european i agree that fahrenheit is superior
Woo! Effort in videos!? 🤯
Glad hes back at it again, wish the best to schlatt and his money
imagine in the schlatt universe there's a stock market he himself crashed
If only he lived long enough to bring back the JackBox series 😕 Fly high big guy 🙏🙏🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️
Gonna slap into my schlanket for Celsius Gang.
Comedy
Hell yes
fahrenheit is good for daily weather measurements while celsius is for more intensive or rapid temp changes, such as in experiments and such
Can someone sum this video up please I can only watch short-form tiktok reaction videos
come to Germany we have no speed limit
No hes right, fahrenheit is better because it's designed to match how humans feel about the temperature, as opposed to how water feels.  Think about it like a percentage.  20%?  Thats not very hot at all 50%?  Thats better 120% hot?  We're dying
Rest in piece “Schlum” you will be missed
Rest in piss my schligga 🙏🙏🙏🙏fly high lil bro, can’t believe King Charles caught him lacking
Huge respect to you big guy. Loved the TikTok reacts but missed the old stuff. Glad your going back to more variety.
Welcome back j shortt. Hope prison didn't fuck with you too hard
Bro please play some star citizen its epic
very surprised "schlatt" beat the "allegations" that were set upon "him," I am very scared to see what "he" does with "his" newfound "freedom"
Something I've always admired & wish more did was be as open as you are about how you approached YouTube & being a content creator. What YouTube rewards & what we want are very rarely the same thing, and it's always tough to choose what's best for us instead of what we suspect has a way better chance for a reward in the end. Whatever content you choose to make, though, I'll support!
SCHLATT IS GONNA DO CITIES SKYLINES? Hell yeah
And we are back, baby
I really missed the city skylines videos
crazy how enhanced AI has gotten lately, it's almost like Schlonger is still here  those families deserved what you did to them. rest in peace big guy 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Can't believe Schlatt was assasinated by Europe after his based take on Celsius being fucking stupid 🕊🕊 fly high king 👑🩷🩷
His actions in 99 came back to haunt him... its like i still hear his voice. I hope the killer gets caught. Fly high king 🕊 🕊
I can't believe he's gone...  and this close to the memorial of such a tragic event
I guess he was one of the drunk crashers after all... Speed along on the endless highway in heaven Schlort, rest in peace 🕊
yes 'schlatt' you are majority water
Rest in peace Schnoz… you will be missed 🕊️
You know that the letter all looks life a big building so does one 1 just like 9/11 two towers just like the twin towers that were destroyed by Osama Bin Laden
To be honest, i liked the viewer submissions alot more than the tiktoks
Great to see you back! Please tell me Pops will return on the alt
Fly high king “schlatt” 😔🙏
Rip schlatt
THANK YOU I WAS SO SAD YOU ONLY DID TIKTOK REACTIONS
I'm scared for what is about to happen but that doesn't matter now it's a good date our guy has finally posted      TBH he was probably in prison  🧏‍♂️ let me out
Nothings gonna change...
Schlatt being gone made me turn to the Sleep Deprived Pod and have to goon, don’t think I could’ve gone on much longer
Damn
Rest In Peace Schlatt, we'll miss you ❤️
Run him out of money guys
Thanks schlut, for never failing to disappoint us ❤️ 🥰, you will be missed rip 💀 🐦👴🏻🕊️🪦
glad you’re back but can i have my money from the merch order? It’s been like 3 months and i still have no schlatt n co hoodie
I can't believe schlatt made an ai to make videos before he died. fly high king🕊🕊
Miss you big guy
In all seriousness I am glad to see the big guy himself branching himself out again. Excited to see some different and creative content
im so glad "sclagger" will stop reacting to tiktoks
At least we know the tiktok content happened because the chad was dead broke
Oh my gosh bros back from prison i missed you so much 🎉🥳
o7
HEY
Schlatt playing videos games on JSchlattLive again feels like we’ve transitioned from war time to peace time
Wish I could have early access to SK2 since it drops 2 days after my bday buuuttt my hard drive holding steam killed itself about 2 days ago so now I'm stuck waiting till Christmas before i can get a SSD as a replacement. Hey, at least my PC will hold 5 terabytes if my 2nd harddrive (and only other working harddrive I can actually use) doesn't die before then! Haha.
thank you deepschlate for the cities skylines content, i really missed mass genocides by your hand! hope you're well.
Wooo jschlatt is back!
May "jshcallt" rest in peace ❤❤❤❤❤
TREVOR MENTIONED
I cant believe this was filmed right before he passed RIP Big Guy
Consider all the cash cows *M I L K E D* 🐮🐮🐮🐮 time to build a whole content farm!
im so glad "'semen''''  got back from prison  🙏🙏🙏🙏
finally no more tiktok reactions ty schlatt for ending it
I love how you can see Jambo and 'Soup' (what Jaiden called him once)
Rest in peace "schlap". hes streaming in a better place
thought it was suspicious this comes out when cities skylines 2 is and then saw the top comment
Rip JSchlatt. I will meet you at the lake of fire.
this whole video is just a cities skylines ad hahahahahaahhaahaha
So happy schlatt finally escaped prison happy to see you again man
Things have really ‘changed’ for that family ever since Schlatt found them in ‘99
I don’t blame ya big guy! As a fellow entrepreneur I know money is the most important thing in the grand scheme of things! Glad to see you got off death row, not a lot of people can say that! Love ya Schlatt! ❤️
These AI generated videos are getting so realistic!
What's with the Sonic pfps talking about how Schlatt died in prison? It happened 7 years ago, guys, move on.
guys do you know what AI "Schlatt & CO" are using to replicate "JHotDog"? I want to use it as my personal e-sex slave boy. I miss Jonathan so much 😢😢
YES
I loved the TikTok vids but I will still watch your content schlatt. I have high hopes for your new videos, and I will be watching them.
You do you Jschluttyboi
NO MORE TIKTOK OH MY GOD FINALLY HOY, SHIT
Woo yeah baby, this is what we’re talking about, this is what it’s all about, WOOOOOOO
Yay he’s a content creator again
Rip jshat😢
Jschlut?  coming out as a gay? man that sucks
Excellent choice, will be watching more
I'm glad you're actually back to making good content, schlant. Hope they don't get that evidence soon 🙏.
RIP  Schlatts, you are not a great loss
but fr though fahrenheit outside of scientific purposes is just better, its more practical as it accounts for smaller changes in temperature, plus who the hell is gonna use decimals to read temperature.
t kiero muchisimo jschlatt
When I heard the news I couldn’t believe it. RIP “Schlatt”. I didn’t think “They” would get him, but those Crimes from 1999 finally caught up to him.
Man its almost like he's still here. Fly high big guy🕊️
Rest in peace Schlatt you will be missed🕊
119k views in 30 minutes????
it's so cool to see the ai "schlatt" branching out in a new direction, but it can never replace the old "schlort" fly high big guy 🕊️
RIP skatt, you meant so much to so many, especially those women you brutally crushed with steel toed boots.😅😅😅😅
They didn't let shlatt leave because of what happened last time shlatt left the country
I'm British and I think Fahrenheit is better, just more accurate tbh
RIP schlatt won’t be missed
real fans remember when the last reaction video had "final" in the title
The decision to change the react videos back to themed fan submissions, and tone down their frequentcy was a great choice. I personally loved the videos where the community got to present to the class as we all watched in horror. However, once they turned into just reacting to tiktoks or general funny videos, I was turned off. I don't think I've watched a shlatt video in a long time because of it. All of this is to say that I'm glad the old shlatt is back.
LETS GOO HES BACK AND NOT ONLY THAT, HES BRINGING BACK THE TIERLIST SERIES!!!!
YEAHHHHHHH NEW CONTENT LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
In all seriousness it’s glad to see you happy again man. You can see the light in your eyes again when you stream rather than just the mindless tiktok videos
schlatt got worried that jackfilms would go after him
Schlatt, we all know that you found a doppelganger to take over your channels. Fly high king.
Ngl, I’ve always been aware of who Schlatt is but never really watched his content until maybe back in March. After becoming more of a fan I was a little bummed out to see he hadn’t streamed in so long, glad he’s back and I get to witness some new chaos
thank god!
Rip Slatt. 😞. It feels like I can still hear him.
Didn’t ask
Schlagg
big guy
Bro only uploaded if he had a sponsor. BTW WHERE ARE MONKEY BALLS SCHOLTY
Rest in peace schlatt you will be missed
I am so glad that you had cut out those tik tok reactions, like the first ones were ok but every one after that was pure garbage, only thing watchable about them was your performance.  But please do more of your customs submissions, those were awesome, I bet you enjoyed the fuck out em too.
they said CS2 would be hard but if shlatt can do it anyone can
I love jscag he is Yoturber
Rest in Peace 😭 but also the hype is real brother™ cant wait for the content *chomp chomp*
I want someone to explain how the Fahrenheit system makes sense, so maybe then i might give schlat some credit Celsius has 2 stable points,  both related to water, bellow 0 freeze, above 100 boil How about Fahrenheit?
Oh God oh fuck "He's" going to make another shitty city
nah... you right.  though metric is great. i feel like fahrenheit is a lot more precice
Im so sorry about this. Condolence to friends, family and people who have known "Schlatt". Rest in peace. Fly high king 🕊️
Rest in Peace Jslat 😪😔
I cannot wait to mindlessly consume more Schlutt CS content this year.
did u gain weight?
Celsius is superior.
RIP Schlatt, its like i can still hear his voice from the video ❤
In your tiktok videos you definitely had much less of the classic jschlatt flare you have that makes you imo one of the most unique creators in youtube
i literally do not care
Jesus used Celcius, if you use Fahrenheit. You are against Jesus
Yes finally
OK, so for the viewer submissions, how does that work? Reddit right? how will i know when or where to submit for the reaction?
Its almost like he's still here- lets all thank Jambo for posting this... RIP schlatt you are missed
Tldr: changing from dick and balls to ball and dicks
Very happy that the entire jury strangaly disapared
Rest in peace you legend may you create as much chaos as in 84 in hell as well
THANK GOD HES DONE MILKING IT
rip jschlatt 2001-2001
Happy 1 yr anniversary to your murder of the queen! Rip Bozo
As much as I'd love the new videos, please do not end the Tiktok React Livestream series
Thank FUCK schlatt is back in the actual, not reaction streamer sense
Rip Shlatt, He might be forgotten one day but what he did in 1999 will not. 🕊️
Schlatt is BACK lets gooooo!!!!! Welcome back Big Guy
letsgoo
when soda tier list
Dear Schlasketball,          My name is Marcus Edward Eugene the 25th, and I believe that I didn't ask.                                                                                                        Sincerely, MEE the 25th.
bruh this is literally south africa rn 💀
As an european, i agree that fahrenheit makes more sense for people, as its made for us, not for water. Although its easier for cooking so.
Thank God. I was getting bored with the only content coming out being reactions.
Rest in peace king ❤
Yesss im so happy i love the gaming vids,lists…  HOPEFULLY YOUR OKAY SHLAATTTTTT!!!
Why does schlatt look homeless
Please don't let Jacksfilms crusade against a successful prostitute stop you from making reaction videos, Schlatt.
Wow AI really has come so far it’s like I can still hear his voice
W change, W content creator keep it up big guy
rest in peace Jonathan Schwartz from jschlatt  one like ekuals one prayer 🤲🙏🙏🙏🤲🤲😢😢😢😢
Hey shlorg sowwy u died 😢
this is gonna go from "i bought a company" to "i bought fucking everything because i have money, you fucking plebians"
Rest in peace schlot. You will always be remembered. Mostly for your crimes in 99. Rip.
I knew Schlatt would break out of prison one day
TIKTOK REACTION VIDEOS ARE DEAD WE GET ACTUAL CONTENT AGAINNN 🔥🔥🔥🔥 fr tho proper streams and Schlart stuff is great
I am glad you are doing what you need to Schlag daddy! I'll be honest my favorite vids of your are those where you are happy and doing your own thing. The gaming streams turned to vods, the view submissions series. All S-Tier!  Sure the tiktok vids were funny, but were more of a guided tour that had a good tour guide. It was nothing new or creative, but it saved time trying to find the funny, and what really did it all in was having a great tourguide to show us around.  I think we all agree though that you making your own stuff, and doing what you want to do is way better than having you scrape through some random low effort vids, and will be more entertaining even if the numbers go down. In the end we are all here for you schlatt, so do what you want!  I am not getting sappy just saying the facts. YouTube an overcrowded place and if we didn't like you the creator but wanted to see more tiktok reposts, we could easily jump ship to one of the thousands of others doing the same stuff all over the platform. Doing something you want, and something more unique brings in those who like your ideas, and you as a creator  Keep up the work big guy   🤠
I am very sorry for Schlatts death, he was a nice guy. Who could've known prisoners would kill him for his Celsius opinions :(
Rest in peace, "Shlewer", fly high 🕊
would LOVE schlatt playing hoi4
Finally he's out on bail for his crimes from back in 99'.
Not enough evidence, yet. The day of reckoning is coming.
farenheit is so stupid it doesnt make sensus no sensus
Rip Schlatt  -1800  - 2020
Rest in piss big man
rip shlit 😞💔💔 you were the best one out there
So Sad About Jschlatt’s Death 🩵😔🕊 Rest In Peace 🕊
i wish he was still alive
THANK GOD WERE FREE
It's all because of the 22nd 9/11 anniversary, i knew it.
Yeah submissions were peak and shouldn’t stop. The community videos on stream are better than off stream TikTokers
Thank GOD
I can't believe AI is getting so advanced it can replicate "Schlatt" in any way. RIP, Schlatt.
The tiktok reactions were much worse than the earlier videos too, at least with the first ones the content was made by viewers
The evidence is still compiling J Shlattosaurus, dont get too comfy too quickly.
Metric system makes more sense schlatt sorry dog —an American, doomed to suffer the imperial system’s weird ass quantities
RIP “Schlatt” he lived a long life but it seems his actions in 1999 caught up to him.
It's like he's almost here😢Rest in peace Schlatt😢🕊💔
thank u god for no longer psting reaction vidoes
I fuckin love Fahrenheit, literally correct opinion. Celsius meat-sucklers seething.
Rest in peace big man 😢
R.I.P Schlatt fly high i'll miss you big boy🙏🙏🙏😭😭
lmfao rip loser
Great vid Ernest proud of you!
Play rabids go home again schlatt PLEASE
Sir i use kelvin because im a degenerate
So nice of Schlatt's family to continue commenting after his unfortunate passing
Wow, shitt resurrected after dieing in prison because the feds found out about 99'. I hope that he will start feeding me and the guys in his basement, its been so long since i last have seen my son lost to this monster. Glad you're back shitt 🎉
I applaud you for taking your health as more important. Takes guts 👍
Bro died
FINALLY NO MORE REACTION SHIT!!!!
LETS GOOOOO WELCOME BACK BIG GUY
im glad to see Schlatt turning his life around again , alcoholism is truly a hard habit to beat and we all love and support you Schlatt. Us schlatters with stand with you for life.
Congrats on doing content you actually enjoy “Schlatt”
23° Celsius? Heh, try 296° kelvin. YEAH THAT'S RIGHT, FUCK BOTH SYSTEMS, WE UP IN HERE WITH SI BASE UNITS BITCH
Hi schlatt. I hope you doing well buddy. You and your friends have helped me through shit and I can't thank you enough for that. When I see your videos they make me laugh. It's sad to see that you've been making videos to make others happy but not yourself. If you do make videos I think you should take breaks between them. Thank you for everything. Take care schlatt ♡
When did AI get so good ? We will miss you. RIP😭
His antics in 99 finally caught up to him
Rest in peace Mr Schlutt, i always remember the crimes you've done, thanks for everything! 😊
o
He fr ran outta money this is justa scam
Im so glad your back, I thought the queen came back from the dead & took revenge on you for what you did in September 8th of 22.
I hope you go bankrupt, so we can finally see the next TikTok reaction video 😁
He always blamed it on the the drunk crashers and the new ones, until he became the crasher. But in the end he was doing what he loved RIP to a real one
For some reason i watch schlatt is to disagree with him and he doesn't disappoint mi
Oh thank god shlingus, the Tiktoks got insanly stale. I’m so glad your going through a “reformation” to become a better member of society!
Jschlatt you will be missed😢❤
I'm so devastated over this loss. Another great creator has been taken from this earth too early. Fly high king, RIP 💔🙏
R.i.p schlatt you will be missed I wish you goodluck with all the people you killed😢
Dawg, "shlatt", after seeing that title I thought yo ass was bouta commit 9/11 again god damn
Thank God I love Your Content man but those videos sucked.   I watched one TikTok reaction and non of the others, and I have been surviving off Schlagg content and old vids (yes I’m sad) so I’m so happy for the change.
yet another great content creator gone too soon.. fly high big guy 🙏🕊️🕊️
Schlatt just dropped the best news of 2023! Can’t believe he is streaming straight out of prison
:(
Jschlatt please it’s been 20 years, I want to see my family again..
he just ran out of adjectives
it’s almost like he’s still with us 😢😢
Potato.
So glad schlatt hasn't stooped low enough to use commiemeters...
I'm so happy big man is back, hope prison treats you well
Rest in "peace" Big Guy, you will be "missed" ❤
thank you for all the memories king. REST IN PEACE
I can't believe J "Schlott" has passed. He was such an inspiration to many  RIP "Sclatt" you will be missed
FINALLY
This means the tier lists are coming back!? The fan submissions?! It's a great day to be a Schlatt fan
I can’t believe he’s gone it’s almost like I can still hear that manic laughter like the laugh I heard from the car that ran over that small family in 1999 RIP
Yeeeeeeaaaaaaaaah! TikTok vids are no more.  Edit: vaguely no more.
Bro we're 60% water
I feel so “bad” after hearing the “news” about “schlatts” passing
So excited to see ur new content!!!
This made my day lmao
so proud of schlatt that he escaped from the mental asylum after robbing a bank full of children employees
Don’t worry shloig
I cant believe he's gone already, guys! 😢 fly high, "Schlatt" 🕊🕊
This video taught me that Mr. Krabs's first name is Eugene, I hate it here
i love how he almost breaks when he talks about landlords
The tiktok reaction videos were the only videos on youtube that acually had me wheezing so hard i thought my lungs would burst sad to see them gone
it'll be fun to see what you get up to :) care
At least you didn't use Kevin measurements on City Skylines
32°f is too big of a number for ice
Too bad Schlatt died just as he was beginning to make good content again, sucks to suck
Hell yeah, back to personal submissions!
R.I.P Schlatt 🖤 Fly high
I'm British and schknife crime has really seemed like he is still with us recently... Rip schank. You helped me survive 15 stab wounds, unlike the guys in 99'
Schlagg me bro.
So they evolve to emergency bankruptcy checks
we're making it out of jail with this one 🗣️🗣️
Hard agree with all the measurement takes
in temp wise celcius makes more sence cause in what word does water freeze at 30 degrees
Its almost like "Schlatt" is still here🕊💜
Rest in peace big guy we gon miss you my kichiga
Schlatt I need money
celsius is stupid!!!! We back
RIP but From a scientific point of view Celsius has a clear advantage in that it is defined as the temperature water freezes, 0°C and when it boils, 100°C. This makes it easy to calibrate instruments anywhere in the world.
I dont know how to feel, Schlatt actually ranking stuff?
2:35 haha exactly what i was doin
Seems Schlatt finally followed those how to make bombs videos :( Fly High Big Man 🕊
2:02 Me who uses C' in canada hearing this...  ☹
Fly high schlatt you will always be remembered as one of the greats 🕊️🕊️🕊️
Rip jschlatt he will always be in our hearts ✊️😔
Man this video really makes me wanna join the army and become government property until 2029! Another great video Big J
Dead channel
schlatt made me gay
I can’t believe my scrunkly poo is gone 😖😖 rip big guy 🕊🕊
Schlatt as long as you post/stream its okay I'm okay your okay its all good
rest in peace dude, thankfully they are uploading all the unrealised videos after you passed away 🙏
I’m so excited
i like the tiktok reactions schatydady
Rest and peace  shlutty 👏🦅
The 156 dislikes are from the disgusting Celsius lovers
Thank god dude, stopped watching ya because of those videos glad to see you starting to experiment more with your content
Fly high jshart 🕊️❤️
"Are you water!?" Yes, in fact I'm 70% water.
water
This is just like how Schlatt changed the lives of those women back in 99
Noo tf is my guy on about , farenheit better than celsius?
So happy that grandpa schlatt has come out off his retirement to supplie us with dopamine 😀
I love shart, i wish he was stiull with us
Do more wii games
sub 30 min nice
Gey
Rip to Shreacts
"Schlatt" back from federal prison who coul've thought he would come back after all this time😭
Rip schlatt
He seems like the type to kid to bite someone and run off with a their gun..
Rest in peace Jay schlitt. Truly the schlittiest content creator ever.
Yo this is Terry, just sayin Hey from all the guys back in prison, keep doing what you do Big Guy
Can’t wait to see future stre- AGGGHHH ugh      Sorry I coughed As I was saying can’t wait to see future VODs see you there big man
I don't care and never show up in my recommendations again.
I'm 100% with you on the Fahrenheit v. Celsius debate.  Here's how dumb C is:  71, 72, and 73 degrees F are ALL 22 DEGREES C. (there's more examples of this, but this is the easiest) And as someone who likes it a bit colder at night, I can tell you there is a MASSIVE difference between 71 and 73 degrees F.
Big guy got outta the joint. Honestly im surprised he was able to pay off the government after the accident in 99 for causing a paradox leading to the accident invoving the queen of england and charlie. Hopefully this means more drunk driving. Congrats on the return big man
"And no, the answer is not prison, they don't have enough evidence for that..."💀💀💀💀💀
them fuckers put Tampere in cities skylines 2? wtf
THANK GOD ITS GONE
no fucking way shclatt posted the njb bluesky screenshot
I came from this
Riposa in pace Giovannathan
RIP schlatt, and the fact that he had just gotten out of prison :( will miss him 🕊🕊🕊🕊
Everyone: react content bad Schlatt: bye bye react content
Got here early! (Pls don't end the tiktok reactions) but I can't wait to see more streams
i cant believe whoever hacked his account is posting these after he died in prison. its just so insensitive. rest in peace shlott 😪
The schlopptent is over, we’re back on the skylines grind
finally lol
Does this mean more rabbids go home?????
"23 degrees. Wait is that celsui-"  **youtube crashes**
they almost caught me too, good thing I wiped the proxy servers clean hahaha how did I get there oops no logs
i hope one day your channel gets deleted ❤ i send you my regards ❣
This is gonna sound stupid but when that Majora's Mask sound played and that yellow text came back I pogged Classic "Schlart" (may his soul drift along the wind with ease)
Why is this the best 15 second start I have ever seen from a jschlatt video?
Good to see scabb upload again. Also you know damn well why they won't let you on planes at this time of the year. Especially after 1999
fly high schlunk
you know fahrenheit is defined by water's freezing and boiling points as well, it's just that instead of it being 0 and 100 it's 32 and 212...
This game looks fire
return of the queen
looks like his lifestyle caught up to him in the end… i will miss “schlatt”
thank god i'm so fucking done with reaction content
I’m gonna miss reaction vids so bad 😭 I get it tho!! Excited for the future
This is the greatest day in schlatt history
Can't wait for schlatt to release his new studio album! Great things on the way!! Much love big guy it was great working with you.   P.S, we're beginning a search for more concrete evidence, Hopefully enough to get you behind bars.
Ever since Big Man "Schlizzle" went out in that drunk crashing incident, I've really been missing his cackle. So glad we can watch some of his last videos from before he went 😇
RIP, he will be missed 😭
RIP Schlatt may he be butter underneath all of his play buttons inside the wall in someone’s home
I missed you buddy, glad you're back! Definitely can't wait for more videos!❤
I can’t believe Schlatt is dead, it’s like can feel his presence in this video 😭😭😭
schlagg doesn't realize how happy I am to hear that the format that makes him happy and me happy is coming back
can't believe he rose from the dead three days later... rip "schlatt" but also welcome back I guess
Rest in peace i can't believe schlatt died 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
I legit unsubbed because you essentially became a reaction channel I’m so glad that you’re going back to your usual self Subbing again big guy :)
SCHLATT SCHLATT SCHLATT SCHLATT SCHLATT SCHLATT SCHLATT SCHLATT SCHLATT SCHLATT SCHLATT SCHLATT SCHLATT SCHLATT SCHLATT
Wow, what is up with all these great celebrities passing away early?...already miss you big guy R.I.P 🙏
Dw guys he’s with the queen now 🙏🏼🕊️
I'm not watching this video
I was expecting Schlatt to admit that he went on a recent killing spree    Jokes aside,.glad you're back
More gaming and rating?! Cannot wait to see more ridiculous shit you get into
Thank god "schlatt" is back
rest in piece big guy💔
No
Rest in peace "Mineshlaft"  1999-2023 Fly high like you made all those women do in '99 🕊️🕊️🕊️
Rip Schlatt, his play button casket full of money is truly the most humble way to be buried.
I don't really like react content, the community-specific ones were fun though. I enjoyed looking at the degeneracy of the cursed Schlatt viewers. It was just completely unhinged.
Ai has gotten so advance that it can perfectly mimic 'schlatt' after his death. RIP big guy
Are you ever gonna go back to video essays? Loved when those were your thing (cool with whatever you do tho, great content regardless 👌)
THE SILGY MAN GRAHHH
2:01 Don’t worry big guy your imperfections make you beautiful <3
I swear it's almost like big guy is still with us. Rest in peace schlott ❤️🕊
Schlatt you were there as my non parasocial friend during my darkest times. I even sold my kidney to donate 50 $ to you. R.I.P in peace, there will always be a shlutt sized hole in my heart.
Davi did a great job editing this
You will be miss Jshlatt, your videos have been a true memory that I will never forget. You will always be remembered and I hope you find your peace. R.I.P
So thankful that they couldn’t convict ya big guy!
Im gonna miss you shlump Fly high 🕊🕊🕊🕊
this is really the moment when “schlatt” changed the location of my intensities
guys is he streaming on twitch or youtube?
A.I. has gotten so realistic, it really feels like big guy is still with us. R.I.P. Big guy🕊💔
The TikTok reactions were videos i just kinda listened to while i gamed or drove but the viewer submission videos were ones i actually sat down and watched because of how outrageous things were made. Im excited to have them come back
Wow... We miss you brother... Thank you for this beautiful last message. It brought me to tears... o7 to the legend ❤️🕊️🕊️❤️
Hi
I think the most logical conclusion to all this is no, Schlatt's not dead, he's just in between the mortal plains of existence. (But other than that, Hi Schlatt. Glad you're doing good/not being dead)
Glad things r about to change. Ur leaving OTK in the dust (same as we all are)?  Great move
thank you for changing up
Man, I'm really gonna miss this guy😢 Shellaot was my favourite tiktok reactor. Rest Easy Big Guy broken 💔
That's cool and all schlatt but what happened to uploading more on the weekly slap?
Have you ever tried to do chemistry with Fahrenheit? It is impossible! Kelvin is the way to go for hard science and Celsius is the way to go for every day life. Fahrenheit only makes more sense for people that are too fixated on what they learned growing up. If you learned how to change what you use as your default, Celsius would be just as effective. I am an American and I still use Celsius.
I would like to honor Shlatt. He's not dead, I just really like the guy
YOU'LL BE MISSED KING😭😭😭😭😭
erm, actually. im right, your wrong. erm and celsius IS the best!
CELCIUS IS BETTER NO ARGUMENT
welcome back from prison schlatt
One year anniversary of the queens death🎉🎉🎉🎉
I miss you schlaat please whoever runs this ai account it is unethical to make a fake version it’s disrespectful to milk this dead streamer that we all miss
Dear jschlatts, I've been watching you for like 2 years I love watching your videos and series and everything. I'm so happy that I get to watch you all the time❤
Finally
POV: Newyorker talking about any other city
First the Queen, now Schlatt, on the same day 😢 Fly high Jebediah.
the world is saved. schatt has stopped his tiktok trend
RIP “Jschlatt”? He was a very mediocre streamer ❤
hearing schlatt say “a year ago” gave me so much unexpected nostalgia
Dear "🅢🅗🅛🅞🅝🅖" you will always have a place in our hearts fly high ❤️🕊️
Schleezer
schlatt is right about fahrenheit. I taught myself celcius and while its fine and works just as you'd expect, fahrenheit is better for measuring ambient tempture. Fahrenheit has more resolution which is very useful when it comes to using thermostats or heating.
Rip schit, you'll be missed <3
THANK FUCK🎉🎉🎉
This "Schlatt" AI is pretty good at keeping the channel alive after he died.
Have you ever thought of trying another Paradox game? I don't know, some Ck3, it could be a money maker, only because of clips
9:23 I think he became joe Biden
Idk why But this feels like ai
Philadelphia
😢 RIP Schlatt 🕊️ He was truly one of the creators of all time
I’ve been waiting for them reaction videos to end.
Just use -20°C for cold and 40°C for hot, sounds easy to me
shart
Love that the old content is back, the wii games video with YouTubers was hard to watch though.
Idgaf man as long as you're posting I'm happy
Jokes aside Im happy for schlatt man back to making some actual fucking content.
Celcius is better.
YUS
Come to north Texas and drive monster trucks with me
Thank god you are out of prison for abuse of three children 😌 (glad to see you stream again)
glad you got your parole schlatt
They finally let the man of 1999 out what were they thinking
It’s like we can still hear him. RIP Jschlatt, you will be remembered
Hooray "jschlatt" is back you spent quite a while at sleep deprieved good to see ya back big guy
The fans saying Rest in Peace to Schlutt are basically SpongeBob and Patrick trying to kill Squidward when he was a ghost.
The fahrenheit scale is also based on the freezing point of water, except Farhenheit also added in ice witch is, believe it or not , frozen water.
I have no good ideas for a comment, but I love jschlatt and whatever he decides for his channel I'm sure well all enjoy it.☺
HES BACK
I hope Schlarg's room number up in heaven is 69, 420 or some multiple of either of those two numbers 😢
well thats fair :D      please release my family schlatt i havent seen them for five years, PLEASE IM BEGGING YOU
Celcius is a more condenced scale, thus it's more simple to express heat - especially with how the objective cold starts in the negative numbers.
ive missed slopping you so much praying you go to hell big guy 🙏🏼🙏🏼🕊
It’s Schlanging rn
This guy isn’t as big as I remembered
RIP Schlatt, you will forever be in our hearts. ❤
I’m surprised at how well AI can replicate “Shat.” RIP Big guy.
His contents funny but I always skip his update announcements. We all know he’s not gonna stick with whatever he announces. XD
good to see you're on parole, can't wait for more!
RIP jshitter 😢
I’m glad he’s addressing this, just do whatever tf you want schlatt. Don’t be a people pleaser. The reason we watch you is because you genuinely enjoy making the content you do so don’t let the views and the money ruin that.
Can't believe he's not around with us anymore. We will be missing you Schlonk!
Imagine being in space and looking at the cock shaped lights on earth
I liked all the reaction stuff (because I'm a loser), but I especially liked the ones that were streamed, it just didn't  quite feel right when it wasn't live with the chat. I'm looking forward to the upcoming content!
Rest in peace big guy ❤😢
YES! WE ARE WATER! OVER HALF OF YOU IS! DID YOU GO TO SCHOOL?!
Hey schlorg do what you want, you earned. Enjoy making life hell in city skylines 2 like you did for those women in 99'
kelvin is better!!
WOO
Rest in piss big guy you will be missed 😢♥️
Schlatt is right about Celsius
It's so sad Schlatt is gone. Rest in Peace King
He ain't dead
Schlatt: are you water? Me: *a literal sack of water and flesh that also contains water* Uhhh
I do agree with you on the temperature measurements tho
RIP Jschlatt😢 So sad to see that his last content produced were half-assed reaction videos. “A tribute to Mario Kart” is my favorite YouTube video of all time and it’s so sad to see its creator go off the deep end, and pass away at such a young age.   God rest his soul✝️🪦
Skat
Wow I can still hear his voice sometimes
2:03 I'm not going to be convinced fahrenheit is superior to celsius by a dead man
Jschlatt died and A.I. is acting like him everybody spread this message
Did you kill the queen?
Rip jshit, you will be missed
Schlatt you should post a new video 3 days from now. Its definitely not because rhe comments are saying that youre dead and Mr. J. C. had a similar situation...
The huge reaction drama that happened recently was because there were people that were not adding much to the content they reacted to, I feel like this has never been the case with you Schlatt, but still, I appreciate when you do content you enjoy doing the most, when you enjoy something we are able to tell from the videos themselves and they make our day. ❤
Thank fuck i hated the reaction videos, but fuck, i did whatch them and i dont regret it
I got so scared and i almost started crying when i read the title
YAY NO MORE TIKTOKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Schlatt the time has come. You gotta just do meth and everything will fix itself.
Very happy that you’re making these changes, glad you’re back big guy
"Truly" disgusting, that "Schlatt" would die in "such" a "way"
i see schlatt is growing some hair on his chin… it’s evolving alas
Why is this in my recommended? I literally have no idea who this is.
Yesssss i cant wait to watch your streams schlatt! Glad youre not dead!
huh
WHAT THE FUCK IS A FAHRENHEIT
Glad schlott has been hard at work reacting
HE IS BACK
I thought this video was abt schlatt coming out as gay
Celsius works better in cold places cause water freezes at 0
Hearing "Schlatt"s last words is so comforting. RIP "Big Guy"
So happy that you’re free big guy
God, can’t believe Schlatt died. Good thing he has these videos on auto upload
So glad you're doing literally anything other than reaction content tbh, excited to see what stuff you do next
RIP big guy 😢
Rest in piece? You guys are saying rest in piece to this monster? After the incident in 1999? You all sicken me.
I hope we see more video essays, some of the best content you've ever made
Damn gone too soon... I can still hear his voice in my head. That pulchritudinous new york accent. Schlatt will be dearly missed 💔
jscat
So happy to watch this while in the hospital during my blood being taken
I missed the good old gaming schlatt
FEDS got him guys, they found out about 1999
2:31 um actually I’m 60% water☝🏽🤓
Schlatt fans see this, realize that this is slightly emotional and some changes are coming, he's streaming again, and immediately say he's dead. Love this fanbase.
ag
RIP jsclump... we'll miss you😢💔
BIG GUY IS BACKKKKKKK
Yessssss hire tevor!!
🥚
Me when i shit my pants
So sad that Schlatt passed away after a tragic road accident
Fahrenheit was designed with 100° as body temperature so yes Fahrenheit is better for measuring what a human feels
rest in pieces "shlatt"
Rip Schlong 🙏🙏 he will be missed especially by those who got affected during 99
Short man jschlatt
Hell yea Schlatt gaming is back
Noooo we like reactions
Those AI videos are geting better and better. Rest in peace schlatt ❤
It’s so sad how’s he’s really gone tbh..we’ll miss your content Schlatt. R.I.P🕊️
did you drop any soap ?
Only Schlatt can make 7 videos out of one stream and pretend its because he was only focusing on money earlier and now its his happiness
I feel sorry for Jambo, rest in peace schlatt 🙏 🙏 I’ll get the Hershey’s kiss guy to deliver the eulogy
Rest in peace Sklump. You peaked with A Tribute to Minecraft and your detailed tiktok rankings. God bless
Hey schlatt we knew it was coming lol, we will miss them, and will fund you by watching them when you post them, and we will watch your OG content! Love you schlatt! We’re along  for the ride!
RIP jschitt, fly high big guy ❤❤❤
Ill be there at the funeral. my 1 sided obsessive relationship with you ended to soon. miss you schlatt
bro im boutta make a website to host his funeral this shits so sad
What is Jschitt yapping about?
I miss him
Hey Schloobies 😏
RIP Schat, you will be missed
Rip 😢💪😡💆‍♀️🤯
Why are these people complaining? They moved in a city called San Francisco, what did they expect?
🍉
You shouldn't be sad that he is not with us anymore😢. You should be happy that he was once with us.
Rollercoast Tycoon is back on the table?
He finally snapped back to reality.
LETSGOO
I can't believe he's dead RIP we will miss you 😔
Rip schlatt  fly high
Fahrenheit gang
Hey Schlatt you are my favorite YouTuber and you have inspired me to start my own channel and if I ever visit the awful city of LA im going to go to Boa's Steakhouse.
1:03 WOOOOOO YEAH BABY THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT WOOOOOOO
It's like he's still here with us. Rest in Peace Schlickwackpaddywhack
Schlatt calling Celsius stupid is VERY American. Bless up America 🙏🏳️‍🌈
i know for a fact most people clicked on, commented a shit joke realised schlatt is more than a meme left.
super glad Glatt managed to scare off the investigators, we missed you big guy
RIP Jslutt, you'll always be missed. If only the police didn't catch you for the event in 1999, you'd still be alive
I cannot Bellerive they killed schlatt and replaced him with an AI model.
YES FINALLY HOLY SHIT dude it broke my greasy fucking parasocial gamer heart to see you get more and more depressed with tiktok reaction and i'm glad you're back to your old stuff, can't wait for more bullshit rants about bullshit topics
i wasnt ready for this. ive loved this guy’s content for years, the world wont be the same without him. rip schlatt 🕊️❤️
Of course schlatt would upload on the anniversary of the queen’s death
Gosh rip 'Schlatt' he will be missed
1 year, I miss him
Fly high brother☹
Sometimes i still hear his voice.. rip schlatt 😔
It's like he's still here 😞 fly high angel 🕊️
as a guy in the science field, yes, metric system is stupid. But i also agree, yes, Celsius is stupid asf. 30 degrees doesn't hit the same as 77
Rip
YES RANKING!! I miss the ranking 😂😂😂😂😂 can’t wait for the new stuff big guy! ❤
Rest in peace schlatt 💔🙏
Rip i will miss you 🕊️🕊️🕊️
It’s so good to see that he was trying to turn his life around before he died rip Schlattington 🕊️
While it was obvious schlatt was never really proud of making the reaction videos I still enjoyed them hope to see more stuff like the japan vlog on schlagg
Who is this "Schlatt" fella
Rest in pizza Johnathan “Schlutt” McSchlurpy, you will live on in the memory of all of your loyal Schlostitutes🤘😔
Rest in peace 😖😖😖😖
Amazing news!
the best temprerature measurment is the one when you measure it not in water but in supperior alcohol like a true chad does💪
theres nothing this community can do like beating a dead horse  seriously some of you no one gives a flying shlart
Les goo  Edit:that sounds wrong
Such great video although i didn't watch it yet... The AI is so convincing it's almost like he's still there RIP Jschlussy... :(
although i enjoyed the reactions i love that the gaming/ranking content is finally coming back
hugs from poland
Rest in piss shatt, thankfully Jambler will be taking over for him along with Big Man to make more content in his stead!
Great to see you're back
Rest In Peace Shlatt 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
RIP Jschlatt 1999 finally caught up with him
That’s cool and all, but we need more tiktoks. I think the change that you should make is from now on only upload tiktoks, and also include subway surfer gameplay over every video so that us viewers can still be entertained with our monkey brain attention span. This is how it is. This is your life now.
I love you Schlatt you are so cool please notice me.
Isiah 57:1-2 1 The righteous perishes, And no man takes it to heart; Merciful men are taken away, While no one considers That the righteous is taken away from evil. 2 He shall enter into peace; They shall rest in their beds, Each one walking in his uprightness.  Rest in peace Schlatt.
Nice
Rest in peace jshrek, rest easy big guy
Man, this AI stuff is really accurate and entertaining. Can't replace the real one though. Rest in peace, Schlatt. 💔
You cannot be serious in thinking Fahrenheit is a better way to measure temperature. What is the scale! Why the hell does water freeze at 32? at least Celsius is based on something you can reference, not just complete bullshit.   I will concede I don't have a lot to stand on, as a Canadian we use a weird concoction of both, it is far too complex to fully get into, you'll have to look up the flow chart, but jesus christ I can't imagine using Fahrenheit for everything. Might as well just pull a random number out of your ass for any temperature. "Oh it is pretty warm out today, must be 110", "oh a bit nippy, it must be 50". At least we all agree on -40 being the same "fuck this I'm staying inside" temperature.
still feels like he's here with us
You will be miss Schalnge… rest in peaz
So sad to see he's gone; he's left a good youtube legacy but i cant believe this is his last upload alive
I'm fine with whatever you make
R.I.P big guy you were always the biggest guy. 🕊️
Reaction content sucks ass and I'm glad you didn't become a reaction channel, yours was the most tolerable mostly thanks to the inside jokes but even then come on dude. I'm glad you're self aware and this is why you're one of the few big youtubers that I trust and respect.
Let's GO!!!
Let’s make him poor.
Rest in Peace Schlagg
you're like the only person who doesn't deserve to have amazing grace sung at their funeral
thank god
rip
jay shalt
AI is crazy, can't believe they would do this whilst schlatt is in prison for what he did back in 1989.
Make whatever you want and I’ll watch it. Thanks for the laughs
🎶 in the arms of the angel 🎶  rest in peace schlatt
Heheh. “Changed”
R.i.p "Schalatt" it's almost like your still here ...🕊️♥️❤️
Holy shit I literally had a conversation about Celsius vs Fahrenheit with a friend of mine, Fahrenheit is literally just "On a scale from 0-100 how hot it is?"
Comments making me actually believe that he’s dead
peace in rest schlatt, youre death is dutifully anticipated
Thank you Matt and Ryan from SuperMega. We’ll greatly miss you 🕊️
Jschlibby, I have to sincerely say that you are wrong about Fahrenheit! It is stupid...  and so is Celsius!  Kelvin is the obvious superior option! Who cares 100°C boils water and 0°C  freezes it?   And who cares that 100°C means fucking human body temperature? Are you saying you are a human? Of course not because no human would do what you did back in 1999.  Kelvin is simple: 0K: you are dead 100K: you are also dead.  Can't get better than that!
fly high shlaft u will be missed 🕊🕊🕊
Alright boys, he's in prison. Time to do stuff. One who get's in cell with him wins.
HES BACK HOLY SHIT!!!!!!!!!
JShlont if you dont post one more tiktok reaction i will reveal what you did in 1999
Remember everyone. Just keep smiling all you smilers.
schlatt saw JJJacksfilms and ran
Schlugged
I miss him...
you can't change my mind celcius is better
so unfortunate that Jschlambaclamb is dead, fly high Jshlinglesy
Schlatt never fails to make our toes curl
This ai. Is so real it feels like hes here with us ♥️🕊️
Good for you jschlatt, do what makes you happy.
RIP schlatt you were my favourite homo sapiens
Glad to see that Schlatt is back from the insane asylum! Hope you are doing well big man.   Extra: on an honest note though, you are 100% free to do what you want as far as content. What is the point in making something that you won't enjoy? Have a good one big guy.
Rest in peace "Schlatt", it seems even his crimes caught up to him in the end. You will be missed 🕊
Finally no more tik tok no more brain rot for Schlatt viewers
rest in peace shladd❤️🕊️
Thank God "Schlatt" is back from the dead (hopefully)
Hell yeah! Glad to see the streaming arc come back!
the thing is 0° fahrenheit means like nothing (I think) but at 0° celsius water freezes so it kinda makes more sense
jshlarter uploaded
0*F is the temperature when water freezes, shut up Europeans
Rest in peace schlatt, I always loved watching you when I was president ❤❤🕊️🕊️
It's almost like he's still here 🙏 🕊️
Now that hes dead how will we charge him for what he had done in 1999? Time to pull out the time machine.
sclongulus: Im not doing react anymore Me: was it the  heroin recipes  Scharf: it was the heroin recipes
RIP, My favourite YouTuber is gone, just like that 😔 life can change in an instant! Repent and turn to Jesus while you still can
RIP schlimmy, U wear the best YouTuber!?!😢😢
this ai shit getting too real. RIP Big Guy ❤❤
My cat died 🔥🔥
Rip Steve Harwell, you were the best singer
guess ill have to subscribe again
Rest in peace schlong 🕊️🪦❤️
happy to be apart of your first stream back, I've never been more uncomfortable
finally no more tik tok 🙏
Hey schalt I think there are maybe snails somewhere near you
9:24 you made a squid 💀
I am a part of the problem I guess because those reaction videos were top tier for me just  because Shlatt’s reactions were that hilarious
rank penis sizes next
nice
Bro's finally going to trial for what he did in 1999
PLEASE play this game i was dying the ENTIRE time.
I can’t believe shut got lung cancer that fast, rip
Glad Schlitoris is making content that makes him happy again
I really miss that guy 😢
Ofc he would post again on the anniversary of Queen lizzy’s death. Rest in pieces to both of them
dont care lol
Would have loved to see you doing new shit, unfortunately you are dead so we will never see the new content. RIP
Sometimes I still see his old comments :(  Rest In Peace Schlunk.
The queens been dead for year and schlart is making content again🎉🎉🎉
So glad to see another Schlong post. We miss you big guy RIP😥
I’m so excited. I know when you upload shit like this, you kinda think about it first. Not the same thing literally every time.
RIP SHAT 1999-2023 🙏🙏🙏
Smash
im just happy schlatt died in his sleep peacefully and didn't experience any pain during it.  shame it happened while driving a bus
Long time sub, and I watched all of his other series, but TikTok reactions was a format I was never interested in at all so I’m glad he’s pivoting again.
this comment section is amazing  (schlatt please upload a video on 9/11 🥺)
I cant wait to watch more videos from schlitt, its so nice to see they're uploading the videos he pre-recorded before dying. RIP "Schlatt"
Slit was by far my favorite content creator. So sad to see him go. RIP❤🕊️
Rest in peace, big guy. You will be missed
So sad to see that this is his last video as he is dead.
Cant believe shlapp created a ai voice to keep making videos after his death, he really cares so much for us. Fly high 🕊
RIP schlort, thanks for all the happy memories you gave me 😢
Rip schlatt the ai is taking over guys
Nice to remember the good old days, he might be missed. Cant wait to see what Jambo will do with the channel.
Rest in peace big guy 😢
All i wanted to hear schlatt
saw the vod. bye
Rest in Peace Schkatman 1942-1999
Oooooh I love it when people switch content types because they usually become happier and it’s so fun to watch
God damnit
Love how schlac stuffs me with  content
I’m glad “Schlatt” will be doing more than just “reaction” videos, those were fun when they started but I feel they quickly lost value
remembering all the good laughs this big guy gave me before he passed😔😔..... fly high schlugg.
Man I can't wait for "Ranking your most horrific crimes" and "Reacting to my viewer's search histories"
😭
Finally the dark age of schlatt is finally over
Glad you got parole friend
thank you mister editor for posting the last thing schlatt  recorded , he will be remembered  RIP SCHLATT 2023
Hey schlart where are the schlankets i am sixty bucks in the hole for most of the year
Why does he sound like ai of himself?
Thank god
good to know that your getting happier. take care of yourself dude, we all love you❤
cant believe this was his last video he recorded before he died.. RIP❤️🙏
schlagg …rest in peace, you will be missed, you were my favourite streamer. You will forever be missed by everyone. Gone, but never forgotten, schlatt 1999-2023.
shlatt is the kinda guy to title a video “things are about to change” and just make a video on city skylines 2 (no problems tho don’t hurt me) also rest in peace shatt i mean shlatt
shawty
Nah, Kelvin best temp measurement.
I love you Jschlit
glad schlatt is back and please make more videos like the japan vlog i dont care if it did bad ill commission it if i have to
RIP Schlatt, forever in our hearts
kumalala
such a big shame that schlatt passed away in the car crash, all the love to the car ❤❤❤
Ah fuck, I was worried this would happen.
I wish the “Big Man” were here to see the Schlatt AI as it destroys his name and reputation. Truly, and I mean this, RIP “Big Guy”
I’m so excited. I know when you upload shit like this, you kinda think about it first. Not the same thing literally every time.
He finally got what he deserved for what he did back in ‘98, good job man, proud of you 👏
Love that this video came out one year since his little incident in England last year
Thank you for reuploading his old content ! It's like he never left us. RIP❤
I'll miss you big guy, fly high ❤
welcome back. nobody point out what happened one year ago today
Don't care, make OpenTTD videos coward.
free my boy from prison 🙏
the true schlatt is back🗣
jschlatt the sequel
Rest in Peace Shlatt, you brought many laughs, you will be missed ❤
this is like the 4th time he made this video
rest in peace schlatt 😪😪😪
Glad to see he decided to pick a happy life of content creation before his inevitable end. RIP schlatt
ON THE SAME DAY AS THE QUEEN DIED
Were you listening to DarkViperAu?
here before age restricted gang
schlonk was was one of the best creators on the platform. He's with big guy now❤
rip big guy we still love you in our hearts🙏🙏❤❤
Shlatt died   Rejoice people the butcher is dead
Time to smile
Wait, JSnack breached containment????
Such a great direction to take the channel, a shame we’ll never get to see it, Rest in peace Schlatt
Rest in peace Schlatt, you will be missed (I think)
Wassup Big guy schlatt love your vids. Your fricking awesome man ^^
Shlaggish shall be remembered
i really do love sclhatt (rip)
May God help his family through these rough times… fly high Schlatt
He's haunting us from beyond the grave
I can almost hear schlatt. Rip schlatt. Epik ai schlatt. Not as good as the real schlatt ngl.
its like he's still with us... fly high big guy 🕊🕊🕊
Will always miss you. you actually made my day. I hope we get more scheduled uploads.
N O I C E
Cant believe the big man is finally gone, i'll never forget what he did in 1999.
guys stop saying rip to the "schlatt" clone, we cannot let him know that he is a replacement to "schlatt"
It’s too bad schlumk is gone… he would’ve loved this video 😔
It’s like he is still here 😢 1 year anniversary of Shlatts successful assassination of the queen!
Glad you'll be doing your favorite things again, no matter how fucking insane your viewers are we missed you big guy ❤
I'm actually so glad we're getting more varied content from "Sclatt"! Can't wait!
Oh wait i already watched the whole vod...
Hopefully he dosent burn to much down there ❤🕊️
fuck yeah
I still hear his voice... miss you big guy.🕊
I love all of Schlatt's work but I'm glad the reaction saga is over. I enjoyed the reaction streams and vids but I never preferred it over his gaming vids or anything else he wroked on really. It's nice to know it was a phase and that it's over and he's moving into stuff he enjoys more
To be fair, last time you left the country the Queen died...
I find it funny that unlike other content creators Shlatt doesn't stick to one gimmick he just goes through arcs
RIP
im sad that he is ending the series but atleast he has my second fav thing of this channel rating things!
Thank you Schlatt!!!! I will return to viewing
It’s almost like I can still hear him :( RIP
Feet and inches make more sense for the same reason Fahrenheit does. It's designed around human measurements. Additionally, because a foot is 12 inches, you can decide it into halves, quarters, and most importantly, thirds, without some .33333333333333333333333334 nonsense. If I gotta do science, then sure, meters are great. But if I'm building a house, that shit better be in ft - in
2:12 is a certificated American Patriot moment
RIP to the big man himself. The people from 1999 finally have justice.
Rest in peace. You will be missed❤
damn, shame that we wont be getting the epic finale to the series, "Ranking Your ADJECTIVE Tiktoks"  maybe for april fools we will get one where you react to the same tiktok for 35 minutes
cheese
Schlatt needs to make more Jackbox streams ❤
You will be missed 😢😢😢😢
i will miss the frequent tiktok reaction stuff but i am for sure excited for the new direction the channel's taking, glad you're prioritizing your happiness over what the youtube algorithm wants you to do, hope everything goes well for you big guy
it's so good to see schlatt is back, rip.
R.I.P shloppy❤️
exactly one year ago, Shlatt didnt have anything to do with the events that occured that day
RIP jshatt you will be missed
Schlatt I was watching that video Charlie made about the drunk driving streamer and I had this immense longing to watch you do some more drunk driving on stream
бонк
I saw schlatt in prison
I hope the truth about '99 finally comes out...
Nice😎
Rip schlatt
L TAKE CELCIUS BETTER, what u mean, ah yes 140Degrees, that sounds wrong and isnt based on something solid such as THE FREEZING POINT OF WATER
The one thing that I’ve always respected about you is that you’re honest. You don’t try to hide that you milk things for cash, and while I usually don’t like people milking things for money, but you are so honest about it that it’s become honestly respectable. Whatever cow you decide to milk next, I’ll be there for it. Do what makes you happy. Have an amazing day my fellow American!
By what Schlatt means, hes going to attack New York again in 3 days. I know what you did in '01, Schlatt.   I'm going to find you.
dude this ai shit is getting out of hand. its like he's still with us...
RIP Schlitt
We’re all happy for you, schlatt. It was about time you  changed your pants
I still can't believe he is gone. You will be missed Schlatt 🕊️🩷
im so happy you are going back to gaming videos
great video schlatt , but my attention span lasted 5 seconds into the video so I’ll just wait for when another creator reacts to this video while I play a family guy funny moment compilation on my second monitor 😊
Honestly I was a big fan of the ranking videos and old gaming videos, so I’m lowkey excited for this.
whats up mr 4 million subs
Yeah tbh i felt the last couple TikTok react vids were a little hit or miss compared to the first few but it's just fun to watch you do whatever you're having fun with anyway so looking forward to what's next
Rest in peices. :(
Of course schlatt makes a big announcement to distract us that today is the anniversary of what he did to the queen.
“They don’t have enough evidence for that” 😂
about time schlott, hope ou have a good time being back!
ill miss schlatt. always gave a good laugh :(
Bro lost an argument with himself 😭
Rest in Power "Schlart" 🕊🕊🕊
If faranheit were linear I'd agree. But the difference in feel between 10c and 20c is the same as 50c and 60c. The difference between 100 faranheit and 90 faranheit is NOT AT ALL the same as 42 faranheit to 32 faranheit. So it is inferior.  It's a bad system.
Thanks for being honest with us Schlatt really appreciate it! glad for the old content to be returning soon! :D
Lets goo!! Can’t wait for your new stuff big guy!
Ai getting too real, Rest in peace Shalagg 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
'Sclott' is back, i'm so glad 'Scat' isn't gone.
i actually love the reactions tbh
I saw that table😂😂😂😂
Ai is getting so good, its almost as if schlatt is still alive 😔
Coincidentally posted this video on the one year anniversary of the “tragedy” “Schlatt” may or may not have committed in the United Kingdom on September 8th of 2022
W content again
You will be missed 😔 💔
If you don't upload for 2 years if i get a notification i will see you man   I don't see live streams but I like the highlight man  ❤❤❤🎉 Thanks for comeback
Rest in peace Stalin 💔 You will not be missed
can we please appreciate all the effort schlitt puts inside of us 🤗🤗
I miss his streams, rest in peace schlatt ❤
Glad you're doing what you want, it's actually surprising they let you out so early for what you did
Rest in peace schlatt 🕊
LEEEETSSS GOOO
man i still can’t believe he’s gone. it feels like just 15 minutes since he was sent to prison. rest in peace jschlatt flight high 🕊️🕊️
I appreciate this obviously but I will also miss the slop- RIP J Schnapple
rest in peace schlottus
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
You will be missed. Goodbye sclot
NOOOOOOOOO
And proving he is basically Jesus Christ, Big Man Schlatt has risen again 🙏🙏
Thank fucking god I hated the tik tok videos. Especially cause of that loud obnoxious guy talking over everything
Rest in peace
While is do think the TikTok videos have run their course… I LOVE the view submission videos because they are creative and geared for you and your viewers
Wow a 12 minute ad  The evolution of content is here
Hi Schlatt!
rest in peace jschlatt you will be missed
I have the evidence, Schlatt. You cannot play it off like we don't know what you did.. How does the Louisiana State Penitentiary sound for your new permanent home..?
I wonder if schlatt's got a special video planned for the big day coming up
Please change your profile picture to Handsome Schlattward, for at least 1 week
A goat is back
RIP 😢 will be missed
womp womp
rest in pizza sachlagg 🙏🙏🙏
thank GOD. love the content but i only watched them cause it was the only thing being made. excited for more gaming.
so sorry for schprutt 😞... he'll be forever in our hearts ❤🙏....
So, You didn't get caught for the things you've done in 1999?
i wish we'd get one more tiktok reaction video just to get some real juxtaposition in the tiktok thumbnail faces you were making.   would've really put a poetic capstone on what truly was innovative cinema
lets be real, this video is just background noise behind vivaldi winter, the violin song that plays
W
congrats on escaping the jail
Glad he is not in Germany because I live there and I would not leave the house anymore
Who is this fake Jschlatt guy impersonating someone who died. How can this guy sleep at night?!?!???!!!??!!??!!!  Rest in tik tok reactions schlotong 🕊️
Schlatt happy = me happy  I'll watch Schnoop stare at a rock as long as he's happy >:(
So sad to hear the news. RIP to my man Jschlatt 💔🕊️
fly high 🕊️
Rip jshlatt gone to soon😢
R.I.P. Johnathan Jebediah H. Schlatt
So glad you are back
I despised the tik tok phase and it caused chaos in many people's lives
Bro who is talking about Celsius and Fahrenheit, Its time to use Kelvin.
you were too young rip jschlatt
Can you respond to this comment to fuel our parasocial relationship?
So sad hes gone.He will be missed.Its like he always said:”I’m not included in the 9/11 thi-
Hey, at least you can rank your TikTok reactions if you run out of ideas. You know... before you do yet another TikTok video.
RIP.
Lets take a moment to thank jschorts for all the new content hes going to stream into our faces ❤
Schlatt was such a horrible guy. He will be missed dearly by all of us. RIP Jschlatt❤️
Glad you are returning to the gaming content, i loved the tiktoks but they all kinda felt the same after a while. Have fun, schlatty patty.
Good on you Shat, thanks for listening to money and statistics (your fans) ❤
Fly 🕊️ high jayshat
Whether Fahrenheit is "worse" than Celsius for measuring temperature depends on context and familiarity. Fahrenheit has its advantages and disadvantages:  Advantages of Fahrenheit:  1) Fine-grained scale: Fahrenheit offers more precise temperature distinctions for everyday weather in regions that use it, as it has smaller degrees compared to Celsius.  2) Intuitive for some: Some people find Fahrenheit more intuitive for describing weather conditions, particularly in the United States where it's commonly used.  Disadvantages of Fahrenheit:  1) Lack of global consistency: Celsius is used internationally, making it easier for communication and scientific purposes.  2) Complexity: Fahrenheit's reference points (32°F for freezing and 212°F for boiling at standard atmospheric pressure) are less straightforward than Celsius (0°C and 100°C).  3) Scientific applications: Celsius is more widely used in scientific research due to its alignment with the Kelvin scale. Ultimately, the preference for Fahrenheit or Celsius often depends on where you live and what you're accustomed to. Neither is inherently "worse," but Celsius is more globally standardized and suited for scientific purposes.
Rest in peace 😢 You will be missed 🙏🕊️⚰️
Fairwell shleeb you will be missed
Martincitopants and Schlatt would have been a mean combo for tjat crane gaming stream
BALANCE! BALANCE!, when are you going to upload another openttd video that's what I'm waiting for.
We miss you big guy. Whoever is using AI to try and make "schlatt" "content" is a hero. Fly high, big guy.
R.I.P "Schlatt" I can't believe he's no longer here 😔, fly high Big Guy 🕊️
My honest reaction
Im sorry your house burned down :(
I honestly think this is the best choice you could possibly make. I kinda missed when you just stream video games and goofed off so I'm glad to see a resurgence in that. Those fan presentations were mint though.
Can't wait till schlatt revives from his tomb 3 days from now 😊
I hope this new Schlort AI will be a worthy replacement. Rest in peace 🙏
what a terrible loss… rest in peace big guy 🙏🕊️fly low buddy ✝️
Can't wait for the prison stream once they gather enough evidence! 🙏
Are you finally get a sex change?
U cannot make the godless land of San Francisco worse. Schlatt trying to divide by 0 with this.
Shlut is dead
My work here is done. Unsubscribed and disliked.
bet that
seeing him confusedly reply to the comments saying rip is cracking me up
wow, schlagg is finally finishing a tribute to ok computer! can’t wait!
Can't believe Schlatt donated $100,000 to real charities...
we need monoliths to exist IRL😂😂😮😮
Whether it’s Fahrenheit or Celsius at the end of the day we’re all human and all boil children 🤗
nooooooooo jcshantttttttttt whhhhhyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Rest in peace shat 😪
Does this mean that youll ban less people on twitch?
It hasn't been the same since the accident🕊 RIP Schloot🙏
thank god no more filth from these shitty reactions.
As much as I liked the reaction vids I'm glad we can go back to some old style content.
I like the new schlottbot which is programmed to respond to comments. RIP 🪦 🤴 you will be missed king, AI will keep you alive

AI is so advanced it started upload videos as shlott, Rest in peace ❤🕊
Resit in piss Jschlatt 😢

Rest in peace “Schlatt”
Rest in peace big guy 🕊🙏
Thank god
Get well soon, "Sklagg"
Man, I can't believe before schlatt died. He got someone to make a 3D model of him and run an AI code to make a video for him. RIP Jschlott 🤧🫡
An underwhelming ending to an overwhelming character. I still can’t believe “Schlatt” went the way he did. May God rest his soul
daddy? sorry. daddy? sorry. daddy? sorry. daddy? sorry. daddy? sorry. daddy? sorry.
i cried because i thought shlatt died in 1999
Fly high Scat😔🕊️❤
every single video i see of schlatts has his fans fucking with him in some form or other. i'm cry-laughing at these comments. Rest in Peace, shallot.

Are you alive?
R.I.P schlatt, I'm so sad he's died
Got a vid in my recommended a bit ago about someone reacting TO SCHLATT reacting to tiktoks. that’s like, an even worse money pit
cant believe he's gone RIP THE GOAT BRO
A new era, ushered in with the sequel to the game that brought me to the channel. Fitting!
He’s leaving Lessgo!
Honestly the tiktok reaction videos were funny (to me at least) and I enjoyed watching them. Good things don't last forever I suppose, but hey, I'm looking forwards to the future and what it has in store! 😁
Dude I’m so happy Schlatt came back to say these final words RIP you’ll always be missed
This AI technology is getting creepily realistic
Just like 5 minutes ago I was like "I'm gonna watch some Schlatt" Not knowing what the hell happened, and then he uploads a new video. Glad Schlatts uploading again. Some of the funniest videos on youtube come from this guy lmao.
RIP Schlatt 🙏 sometimes it feels like I can still hear his Schloice
Amazing Schlitorus video, so sad he died tho
RIP "Schlaggungton III" Now you can forget what youve done in 99' to the family thats 6ft underneath your garden.
We all miss "schlatt"er. i cant believe its been a year since he passed away and "took" the queen with him
Thank you so much for everything, Semen, you'll be missed. Rest in peace, man 😢
Can't believe he left us. He was so young. 37 years is too little time god darn it..
i will be sad
Finally
Fly high my friend 🕊️…
RIP schlingus

Big shoutout to the family of "schlatt" for taking the responsibility of uploading all the videos he never was able to
Rest in peace jschlatt. You were my favorite YouTuber and hope that your successor does well in managing this channel. Fly high king❤
I'm still waiting for schlatt to play a roblox rpg adventure
Baller
Jshnopps you always do this where you make some videos and decide you don't like them anymore   He's consistently inconsistent
It’s like I can still hear shlict❤
But jschlggg I am not a loser for watching raction content from you 😢
Cant believe schlatt is dead, 😭 although his skinwalker is doing a good job 👍🔥💯
Rest in peace schlatt <3
rest in peace "schlatt" i will miss you been a fan since "1999"
2:00 Kelvin is the best unit to measure temperature, Celsius and Fahrenheit suck in comparison  RIP Big guy
I love you like a brother Slime, I hope you made it into heaven 🫶🏻 (RIP)
LETS FUCKING GO

Rest in pythagorean “Schlagg”. You might be missed
Man, i can still hear “schlatts” voice, he will be missed. Rip
Good to see one of Tucker’s co-host is doing well 😁
No way funny Minecraft man uploaded another video
Finally no more cock and ball videos.
Where were you when Schlutt died ? Apolgy for bad english. I was at home eating Dorito when phone ring : " Schlitt is kil" "no"
I was there for this. I hated it. 0/10 would not do again.
I'll always call him Schlatt, because Schlagg + Fatt = Schlatt
it’s like he’s still here with us..🕊
isn’t it exhausting to always have find a new niche to keep audiences entertained? heaven forbid that that new niche gets rejected like the tiktok reactions. it seems like there isn’t an end in sight
YO CITIES SKYLINES 2
gay porn
Rest in peace Schlott, fly high 🕊🕊🕊🕊🕊🕊
Celsius > Farenheit
Glad that "Schlatt" has some sense in his brain to use not use Celsius, it's a garbage measurement system. Also glad they haven't found that knife buried by interstate 40, just off exit 89 in Arizona to the left of the Wendy's drive in under 3 feet of concrete. Evidence like that could send someone to prison.
RIP.. his relatives are posting his drafts 💔
Rest in peace jshitted 🙏 we will miss you
Rip Jslut 🙏
what a lovely video to come out on the deathaversary of ol lizzie
RIP shat. We will ALL miss you...
2:23 love how he cut out the part where he defeated himself in his own imaginary argument where he said "humans are 70% water"
Ahh time to fulfill his financial obligations
Lovely , can we do YouTube shorts reaction videos because we all know YouTube shorts are better
Yea baby!! Let’s fucking go!
1999 has caught up to him in the end. He put up a good fight. RIP "schlatt"
2:33 did you really cut off the part where you realized you were wrong? lol
Right after i finished watching this i went over to schlatts channel and you can literraly see the smile fade from his face in the thumbnails with each new tiktok video
So no onlyfans?
RIP SCHLATT😭🙏🏻
Fly high Schlatt, you'll be missed 😔
Well, it was good as it lasted. RIP big guy. Hope we still get an edited version of his drunk driving accident
No comment.
fr though I'm so happy to see real content coming back, I really feel like a new era of YouTube is on the horizon with the whole Mr beast vs T series thing coming up as well. feels like 2019 again and I'm ALL for it.
prison
Schitt, you will be missed. I will (not) miss the tiktok reactions, there were still so many adjectives we could've used, so many npc streams to watch. May he finally find peace in heaven, amen
why the hell is everyone saying schlongerus is dead, he isn't right? right??
Im so sad "schatt" died and left this video to upload after his dead 😔 RIP big man 🙏
its so sad he's gone, it still feels like he's here with us....
hell looks nice, didn't know they had wood down here, anyways RIP schlatt ❤️‍🩹☹️

Rip schloit 🕊️🤍😪he will be missed 😢
RIP 🕊
Who is this dumbass who's trying to impersonate jschaltty that's so disrespectful especially after his recent death via drunk driving, idk what his goal is maybe to make us feel better because we miss him but making money out of it is not the way to do it hopefully this maniac stops with his crimes already and let jshussy rest in piece in hell.
Finally, no more tiktok
TAMPERE PERKELE
Im really happy "schlatts" family released the last recording of him after the accident (Rest in peace 🕊 ❤)
4:01 *Not Just Bikes will remember that*
Thank god, now we can move on to reviews of alcoholic beverages
Pos tikok
Its Like he's still here with us. Rip Big Guy 🙏🙏🙏
rest in piss😭😭
Where is my schlanket schlatt
leave it to schlatt to talk about how fahrenheit is better than celsius despite the numbers being as inflated as zimbabwe's currency, I will really miss these times, may he rest well with the queen
rest in pease shlajstt, died while drunk and driving, we all miss you
finally
Guys I think he wants more money but In a good way
RIP Schlatt. It was only a matter of time before King Charles got his revenge for the death of his mother.
Oh man i am gonna miss the old content
RIP Schlatt, he finally got retribution on the crimes he did in ‘99 and for what he did to the queen
thank god no more tiktok videos, ill finally have a reason to watch again
I'll never forget what you did to those people in 1999. RIP Scatt
Bro how tf does Fahrenheit makes more sense than Celsius???  32 is such a mundane number. 0°C = really cold to the point of water starts freezing. It's that simple _c'mon_
Nah, nah, he’s so right about Fahrenheit being better, it lets people be way more precise with weather.
So exited to watch your new contact
You know Schlatt, you seem to like cities skylines a lot. Did you know it’s a finnish game? Maybe you could come over for a coffee sometime.
The trick is to get a team to do everything for you, so you just read off of a google doc and pretend to react (tried and tested by a certain someone)
The second 1999.
Among us
early
Rest in rip in piece Jay Schloncc.
He finally escaped the reaction prison
RIP Schlatt, we loved you fly high 🕊❤
Super good to see Schlutt is back from federal prison🙏 I can't wait to see what new content he'll make!
Can we at least get fan submission reactions? Lets be honest that Presentation reaction slapped. No tik toks just...shit the fans send.
I hope schlatt rests in piece he was one of the goats🫡🫡
me in canada in twenty tew degrees  being the actually the best case ontario for weather
so glad we have AI nowadays, it's like he is still with us 🕊🙏
Schlatt being confused at all the RIP comments cos he hasn't read his comments in like 7 years is PEAK comedy
rest in piece schaltshaker, its amazing to see how far Ai has come to where i can still hear his voice and see his face
not saying this in a bad way towards you but thank god no more tiktok reactions
Fly high Smatt we will miss you 💔
RIP SCHLONG, you will be missed
Yipiii the schlot is back lets goo!
Tragic to see him go rest in peace
I miss him so much, fly high
YES FINALLY THANK YOU SCHLATT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT FOR MONTHS!
rest in peace schaltt, i just want to say that you've been a big source of happiness for a large part of my life, it's like he's still here
so sad how Schlatt died of a heart attack in 2019
saw some people commenting about some anniversary, no clue who lizzie is but happy anniversary <3
really sad that they shot Schkank in the back of his head after evidence came out regarding his assassination of the Queen. 😢
Its almost as if hes here RIP
You should totally do a did schlatt win of °C vs °F
Glad to see you back from prison Jslutt! Man, sad to hear about that Schlatt guy, heard his car got rammed by a train? Almost as bad as what you did in 2001. R.I.P Schlatt.
Schlugg
I watch the live stream
Rest in Peace Big Guy, I still cant believe you're gone
DUDE! i cant with this guy man, Celsius is BETTER why? well because we ARE water??? like actually so stupid man I'm so MAD dude... like how can you just sit there with your little toy skyscraper game and WINE about the better measurement, all you do is WINE, i 100% guaranty you that this guy says "soccer" too, actual selfish person, i would go off SO much more but i am restraining myself because i can actually control if i wine to much, you cant apparently. This guy in his silly little room and his microphone thinking hes the man to tell ALL of us that hes right, you see how that's wrong? did you go to Harvert or something? Id keep quiet next time boss. I cant anymore with this guy, unsubbed SO fast.
I love it when “schlock” (1999-2023) goes from “tick rock” to “steaming”. Very cool!
jschlatt
We are in fact 70% water.
It's so sad Schmart is flead rest in schmiss smig guy
"Schlatt" will be missed 🙏🏻RIP big guy 🕊
Fly high its almost like he's still here 🕊🕊🕊🕊🕊🕊
After discovering the secrets of making a youtube shorts channel he came back to us
Pp
Jschlatt you ok my guy❤
"They don't have enough evidence"  Well this video could count
too soon schlatt 😭your with the queen now 🙏🕊
Schlatt is in denial about his death anyway rip schlatt ❤
thank fuck no more reactions
American living in the UK here, you are correct. Everything metric is better except Celsius on a human scale. I will argue this until the day I die (just like you, big guy. RIP)
To summarize: Schlatt no longer needs to abuse the algorithm for money.
Rest in peace schlatt🙏🙏❤️❤️🕊🕊 your handsome face will be missed.
"Schlatt makes san francisco worse" wow I didn't know they could do that.
this ai is getting scary, it fells like he's still with us🐥🐥🕊
Does this mean wii games are coming back?
Honestly really glad to see this. Seemed like he was just chasing the money, and it showed in the videos despite how many views they got. It wasnt for fun anymore. Glad to see hes getting back to making projects he actually enjoys, like that japan vlog.
man I miss Schlatt. I can’t believe he’s gone. RIP
It’s so good that ai has gone so far that we can generate final messages people have left before they die 🕊️ so sad he died in a freak car crash accident that then got turned into a Roblox POV 😞 rest in peace schlott, you will be missed 🕊️😞
Happy September 8th Schlatt
Rest in piss my grandfather wont forfi e you for 99 schlit
RIP MY MAN 😞
“Schlatt” is not pregnant yet he never fails to deliver. I can feel the Schlattening coming inside me
Oh my god no more reaction  vids let’s fucking gooo u watch all of your vids and listen to all of your episodes
its like i can still hear his voice, fly high spit 🙏
RIP "schlatt" its like hes still here with us
May Schlaut rest in peace
Of course this is uploaded a year after the fucking Queen dies. RIP Queenie
rest in peace.
ai is getting so good, it’s almost as if it’s him😢😭🪑R.I.P Scat
RIP Schlatt it's been a good run bruh F in chat

This video was such a good tribute to the late Schnauzer, fly high sweet prince
Get well soon man. 🙏🙏
Rest in peace "schlatt", you were truly one of the big guys, fly high schlitoris 🙏🕊
New Schlatt update goes crazy
My Gamersupps free samples  arrived at the same time you posted this, and as we all know correlation always means causation. Therefore I am the reason you posted  this, y'all in the comments are welcome.
your "content" really puts a "smile" on my "face" keep up the good work
I feel so bad for the late “Schlatt.”  Rest in peace, fly high, king 🕊️
Missed big guy fucking year is complete
RIP Shart, you will truly be missed
RIP Schlatt, you will forever be in our hearts. ❤ fly high…
guess i’ll just have to watch jschetty now.. fuck.
Rip "schlatt" he was so good at making cities and consistently streaming.
Im so glad that jschlatt had absolutely nothing to do with the events that occured on September, 8th, 2022.   Because that would be REALLY bad if he did... so its a good thing he doesn't. Totally no relation. Yup.
Rest in Peace Schlatt 🕊️ 👼
Rest in peace schlagg :(
That you for sponsoring Finnish taxpayers Scklonk
Rest in piece big guy u will be missed
Hear me out on this. More jackbox??
100% agree on the farienheight thing tho
thank laerge man
Of course he posted this on the date on the queens death ☠️
We lost a real one today. RIP Jschlatt   o7
R.I.P. shlortnoodle, you will be missed. Just like those women that were missed by their family back in 1999. Fly high schplinter.
WE REBUILDIN' THE TOWERS WITH THIS VIDEO🔥🔥
Its almost like he’s still with us 💔
rest in peace schat 🙏🙏🙏 ai really is super realistic now. hope it does good on this content 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
rest in peace slutt I hope they find your body
The honesty in this video is really damn respectful. The tiktok vids felt kinda lame after you stopped streaming just felt like you just over reacting to get enough content. Of course, i still rewatched each reaction video like 12 times because youtube kept shoving it down my throat, but i think most of us would rather watch you make different videos. The tiktok reaction concept without any chat influence/real submissions just seems tired. Please dont hurt me
What temprature does water boil in fahrenheit schlatt
schlatt please unban me from you're subreddit
Goodbye schlatt you will be missed
if only San Francisco looked like this (RIP schatt 🕊️)
2:31 We're roughly 60% water. :)
why is everyone saying schlatt is dead? the channel is called jschlattLIVE, idiots
I miss Schlingus Bingus. Rip mate, hope it’s good up there.
R.I.P schlock, it's almost like he is still here.
Thank god, I happy there will be no more TikTok stuff
Missed CitySkylines videos, glad to see them again
i am once again asking for your lubed up onlyfans! when will i be able to purchase this! thanks.
it's amazing how AI can essentially bring back the dead. It's like he never left. Rest in peace, Shlob. We won't forget you anytime soon, big guy. ✊✊
2:30 actually yes I am, I am 70% water and so are you.
Cannot believe hes gone, rest in peace schlatt. I always loved his videos :(
Behold. San Schlatt Stub
RIP shcaltt bruh 😔
Can't believe "schlatt" (RIP) was prevented from fleeing the country
Sometimes i can still hear shlatts voice... may he rest well
You will truly be missed Schlott. Rest in peace king. ❤️🕊💐
I know what you did back in ‘99.
Year since Queen Passed, good job at not going to jail for that
R.I.P 🕊️Big man 🙏
also RIP schlort 💔
i hope you get better shat 🙏
3:53 Schlatt did it. He did the impossible.
This game actually looks fun😂. But also i literally just started watching his reactions yesterday and finished with the pc setup video this morning 😂
Wow AI has come so far to allow us to still be able to watch the Big Guy again, truly the pinnacle of technology, RIP shatty
LETS GOOOO im so glad Schlubba schlubba the second has broken free from the chains of tik tok reactions, very proud of you sheeble, looking forward to the new content!
RIP to Schlutt he atlas has joined the Queen🕊🕊
rip shizzle
Honestly I’m so glad your done TikTok’s. I found them entertaining but we all know you have way to much talent to just watch tik tok for a living.
Looking forward to what markiplier does with this platform! Its terrible what happened to schlatt but at least his channel is in better hands now ❤
funny that the day “schlatt” finally decides to post also JUST HAPPENS to be the anniversary date of the queen’s death…
Bro triple dipped on a single stream. Truly an industrialist innovator.
Terribly sorry to hear about Schlatt's death. My condolences to his family, he will be missed.
im happy you take steps to enjoy what you do. i'd absolutely prefer you did that over another tiktok react. and to be as parasocial as possible, it makes me happy when i see you talk about things that matter to you, as well as taking care of yourself
Rest in Peace Schlatt. He's not dead but probably asleep.
The thought that Schlatt and RT would've been in extremely close proximity to each other if he were allowed to leave the US is TERRIFYING
Atleast us europeans don´t have a unit named after Kelvin Klein.
Cant believe a Ai version of schlatt is taking over the channel after schlatt died. R.i.p big guy🕊️🕊️🕊️
Actually really interesting to see a (semi) serious video for once, glad to hear your doing stuff thats gonna make you happier schlatt. RIP
Someone marry this man and take over all the belongings he has so he does another tik tok reaction series
I can't wait to watch shplett play video games again. It's been a while
it's almost like he's still uploading
Big guy, needs a big smile
all jokes aside, good for you for just doing other stuff. i love everything you post so whether you do it or not that's fine. but just post the videos you want to, RIP!!
Jscat
A couple of days ago I commented on every one of the  reaction videos the problem with the series to try and get  Schlatt's attention so he could see the problem and try to change his content.  I hope I was one of the reasons he decided to finally open his eyes.   The only reason I'm hoping that I was one of the factors that made him make this decision is  ONLY to make myself feel helpful and good about myself so I can sleep better at night.  Anyways, so good to have you back, king!
wow. RIP "sclit" you were always my favourite youtuber, i'll miss ur content         p.s. we know what u did with that child in 1999
RIP ❤❤
Long live schlatts legacy. Miss you more and more everyday brother🕊️🕊️
pookie noooooooo i loved the tiktok reacts 🥺
Big F we don't get to see big man react to the "Oh YEEEEAH" guy anymore
AI has gotten so advanced. Rip schlatt❤
can’t believe you guys are saying schlatt is dead. It is truly disgusting that people would do this horrible thing. iykyk
so happy you got release from prison
I can still here his voice, Rest in paradise shart 🙏🕊️
I can’t believe “schlatt” is actually gone 😢 fly high big guy 🕊️🕊️❤️❤️
idk what your current stance is on making video essays kinda like you used to, but i just wanna put it out there that they are super entertaining. idk why but just something about you literally just talking about video games is so entertaining. not even just video games, like that rant video with the corporate font/art style stuff was so entertaining.  i remember you said somewhere you enjoyed SOMA and its like one of your favorite games, and i know id really enjoy seeing something with that game from you. not even just like video essays but just kind of long form, layed back(ish) videos talking about just cool shit. that would be cool; if thats the type of content your interested in making anyways.
RIP schallt you will be missed ❤🕊️
wheres my schlanket
So glad your back big guy, cant wait to see what you have planned next!
kiss me schlungus
I don't know why you continue, you know you'll never live up to the legend of our long sense passed Schlatt. R. I. P Schlatt 💐
The world won't be the same without him 😔
R.I.P. Jshlort maybe next time don't go to Enumclaw, Washington.
Rip comments everywhere

Thank you schlott, my shortened attention span couldn't watch the vod
Nice of you to post on the one year anniversary of your greatest accomplishment ever May she rest in peace. 🙌
i love you big guy <3 and if you are gonna stream more i really cant wait, im in the dreaded UK and i stayed up at like 1am when you were streaming just because of how great it was watching you play
This day a year ago, I lost my fav YouTuber jschlatt 😢 Jschlatt: QUIT TELLING EVERYONE IM DEAD! sometimes I can still hear his voice 😭
Cheese 👍
It really feels like he's alive..😢
Happy one year anniversary on the thing you didn’t do! :)
Glad that you're back Schlatt.
Did not expect a new vid I wish you make more vids
Damn I've been a fan since SMPLive, sucks that Big Guy is dead. We will always remember you king.
we do not care what you upload, keep yourself happy and do what you want to do first, its gonna be amazing to watch anyways!
this AI stuff is getting too good this video feels so real RIP
rest in pieces my babygirl schlit 😔
too bad the bigman passed away before we could see the end of the tiktok react era 💔 miss you schlatt 😔
I can't believe he's really gone... Rest easy, Schlatt. You were a real one 🕊️
rip shart, he was truly a great "man"
Good to see "Schlatt" back on youtube!
welcome back schlatt how was prison
thanks for being sober for us in this video big guy
I'm so sad poor schlaat had to die so young. If only he could live to see his success. Fly high buddy. Fly high
nice
Schlatt will always be there watching us. Fly high bro ❤🕊️
Rest in peace, it was good ride
He will be missed
Goodness, AI is getting too powerful. I was nearly fooled, but I know he’s gone. Fly high jschlong 🕊️
damn i miss this big guy, rip schlatt
We will miss you shart
3:58 that’s statistically impossible
I sure hope "schlatt" feels happy again soon because he makes so many other people happy (except for those poor 6 women back in '99)
HE'S FUCKING DEAD MAN, I'll miss him..
Here's my big essay: Oh my days I'm so excited it's not just me. It's good to know there's another person out there who likes metric but hates Celsius. "Celsius is so easy" they said. "It's bound to commonly needed physical constants" they said. But who actually knows what those numbers mean!? Fareinheit is so easy. 0 degrees is cold, but not unbearably cold. 100 degrees is hot, but not unbearably hot. When a big heatwave comes into canada, they change the numbers right of the decimal place. When the same thing happens to Missouri, they at 10 to the number.
It's almost like schlitorus is still here... 😢💔
Thanks for being sincere about the reaction videos, I only wish you were this sincere at your hearing back in '99
September really is the month for losing what we love. The towers (2001), The Queen (2022), and Shat (2023). RIP you will be missed
Rest in peace, shlagg, we will all miss you
Damn, welcome back from jail dude! But I have a question for you... did you cause Covid-19?
rest in peace “schlert” we will miss you and the incident.
I miss Schlatt so much sometimes it's as if I could still hear his voice. May he rest in peace :(
It’s as if I can still hear him fly high brother😢🕊️🕊️🕊️
3 minutes in and somehow you offended most Europeans. why, farenhait better than Celsius?? 😭💀  also how was your prison escape?
Schlatt never fails to fill me with his creamy content 😊
damn it.... Eventually We'll have enough to put "Jschat" in jail for a very very long time.
his victory will be celebrated in 3 days. we can only hope he wont do something like that again for the anniversary...
Gather around the profit speaks
Ok thank you schatt
I’ll miss you schlatt another one gone too soon 🕊🕊🕊
2:31 we are 75% water so yeah,fuck farenheit
Rest in peace schlagg… he was so young… 😔😔😔
Schlatt got tired of seeing poor people (I'm tired of seeing me too)
Why did you have to die? Why did it have to happen? Maybe it was karma. Maybe it was a long time coming.
who the fuck is kelvin
this video was pre recorded rip jshlatt he got bombed 22 years ago
I thought "schlatt" Was finally in prison for the crimes against those women
man I miss jshlogg   fly high
hi wedadfaegaegaefcv
Cancel this man immediately who even uses Fahrenheit us Europeans are vastly superior than you YANKS
OH MY GOD IM SO PROUD OF YOU TREVOR MY BOY, YOU MADE IS SO FAR AND YOUR TALENT AND DETERMINATION DOES NOT GO UNNOTICED
We'll miss you big guy, you'll always live on in our hearts. Rest in peace bro
Rip shat

"Scholt.." i miss him so much. Its almost like hes really still "here" ❤❤❤❤ rest in "peace" big guy
so glad pyro came back from prison
I’m happy that Schlatt is returning to doing the viewer submitted stuff, because this entire fan base is filled with the most mentally deranged and unstable people imaginable
"I'm not in prison, they don't have enough evidence for that..." Did he forget what he did on this day one year ago?
I was getting pretty damn sick of those react vids. Future's lookin good!
I was just wondering if diablo nemesis is the best beyblade ever
i wasnt gonna say it but the reaction content was so lazy bro
YOOOOOO MY NI IS BACK ❤❤❤
I hope u beat ur cancer this video is super sad  i hope u beat ur cancer
Really brings a tear to my eye. "Schlatt" was such an entertaining and unique content creator. He will be missed such. Rest In Peace Big Guy "Schlatt".😢

RIP Schlagg we'll always remember 1999
It's almost like I can hear his ghost..

Schlatt I want you
i’ve been wanting more schlatt content for a while, i’m tired boss
And so Schlatt (RIP) rose from his grave and brought miracles anew.
L take on the fahrenheit celsius thing o to 100 is way for easier then 32 to whatever tf water boils in imperial
Our dumb little measurents are better than urs can't convince me otherwise complained abt purs can't defend urs tho Fahrenheit=no fucking sense
schlüt this video will be used against you in court. Its time
The Cream Stream is Back
Rest in peace 🙏🙏🙏 you will be missed, forever known in history as the man who first discovered the 11th planet in the stratosphere, and discovered gravity 2
Its almost like i can still hear his voice ❤
seeing “Lakeland” in that vid was so jarring..shout out Lakeland, FL. yay Polk county ! (it’s awful there so glad I moved)
WAR IS FUCKING OVER GOODBYE TIKTOK REACTIONS
man, this "jschlatt" ai cover thing is getting really good at convincing us he's not currently serving 17 consecutive life sentences for what he did in '99
"things are about to change"? Is "shlatt" planning to start another tragedy?!
Where can I buy the “schlanket”?
We will miss you shllit 💔
It’s like he’s still here with us :( Rest in Peace Shlagg. Everybody comment your favorite moment in memory :(
I'm glad his family could give us his last words, you will be missed.
I mean honestly
Rest in peace Schlottypoo ❤
Schlatt I was just in Austin a couple days ago but couldn’t find you, do you not go outside or were you in prison?
we got schlatt back baby!
Can't wait for what's next ngl. I love the reaction vids but it's a good time to change with *ahem* recent events.
first
schlatt i wont forget what you did to my family in 1999, give them back.
Fly high GaySchlut ❤ We miss you 👑

It’s almost like he’s still here, RIP “Schklott” 🤧
Rest in piece shlättör.. You Will be missed  Fly high like The two planes in 2001
Hello jayshalt
Rest in P
the reaction videos were at the peak with the themed submissions like presentations, rooms, etc. those were really good because they were all created speciffically for schlatt and his community. the tiktok reactions were entertaining, i still watched them, but the presentations and stuff were peak
everything European is just better, stay mad :)
The Superiority of the Celsius Scale   Introduction  The debate between Celsius and Fahrenheit is a long-standing one, with both temperature scales having their proponents and opponents. However, when examining the practicality, scientific relevance, and global consensus, it becomes evident that Celsius is superior to Fahrenheit in many ways. This essay will explore why Celsius is a better temperature scale for everyday use, scientific applications, and international communication.  Simplicity and Scientific Consistency One of the primary reasons why Celsius is superior to Fahrenheit is its simplicity and scientific consistency. The Celsius scale is based on the freezing and boiling points of water, which makes it highly intuitive and easy to understand. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius and boils at 100 degrees Celsius at standard atmospheric pressure. This logical and consistent scale simplifies everyday temperature comparisons and calculations.  In contrast, the Fahrenheit scale lacks the same scientific consistency. The freezing point of water is set at 32 degrees Fahrenheit, and the boiling point at 212 degrees Fahrenheit. These values are not as intuitive as those on the Celsius scale, making Fahrenheit more difficult to grasp for both scientific and everyday purposes.  Global Consensus Another crucial factor that supports the superiority of Celsius is its widespread international adoption. Celsius is the standard temperature scale used in the vast majority of countries around the world. This global consensus promotes consistency and simplifies communication across borders. Whether you're traveling, conducting international business, or collaborating in scientific research, using Celsius ensures that temperature values are universally understood.  Fahrenheit, on the other hand, is primarily used in the United States, which limits its utility on the global stage. The inconsistency in temperature scales can lead to confusion and misinterpretation, hindering effective international cooperation and communication.  Scientific Research and Education Celsius is the preferred scale in scientific research and education for several reasons. It aligns with the International System of Units (SI), the standard measurement system used in scientific disciplines worldwide. This alignment simplifies calculations, data analysis, and scientific communication.  Furthermore, Celsius is better suited for scientific research involving temperature measurements because of its linear relationship with the Kelvin scale. In contrast, Fahrenheit lacks this direct relationship with the Kelvin scale, making conversions and comparisons less straightforward for scientists.  Everyday Practicality Celsius is more practical for everyday use in various aspects of life. From weather forecasts to cooking recipes, Celsius provides a more intuitive and user-friendly scale. Most scientific instruments, digital thermometers, and weather apps default to Celsius, reinforcing its practicality.  In contrast, Fahrenheit can be perplexing for international travelers or individuals interacting with scientific data from countries using the Celsius scale. Converting between Fahrenheit and Celsius can be inconvenient and prone to errors, leading to misunderstandings and potentially unsafe situations.  Conclusion  In conclusion, Celsius is superior to Fahrenheit for several compelling reasons. Its simplicity, scientific consistency, global consensus, compatibility with the SI system, and everyday practicality make it the preferred temperature scale in both scientific and everyday contexts. While both scales have their historical significance, Celsius emerges as the more logical, universally applicable, and scientifically relevant choice in the modern world. Embracing Celsius as the standard temperature scale promotes clarity, accuracy, and effective communication across borders and disciplines, making it the better choice for temperature measurement and reporting.
Meat tier list please?
It is like he is still among us😢 but it is probably the ai

cant believe AI can do this type of stuff. Fly High Jschlatt!
The TikTok series were worse than what you pulled in 99.
thank you schlatt i cant wait for smp live 2
I'm just happy to see schlog furthering his character arc
gotta say, "Schlagg's" reactions are 99933773x better than sssniperwolf
BIG GUY IS BACK!!!
Nah shat the reaction videos weren't it to me, and I'm excited for more genuine content that you enjoy making bro 😊
I kinda love the tic Tok reactions
I’m so sad Schlott got hit by a semi-truck. Rest in peace king 👑
glad to see no more reaction vids where schlatt is definitely always completely sober and not under the influence of any alcohol
Let's face it, Schlong reacting to our submissions is light years funnier then the tik toks
Fly high king <3
schlongus
My favourite discomfort streamer 😌
He ran out of adjectives to add to his videos, don’t let him fool you
Welcome back from the England prison for killing the queen jshat!
Its like I can still see his smile as he holds his wallet for a contractual obligation. Fly high Big Guy ♥🕊🕊
Fina-fucking-lly, actual non braindead content
It's like i can still hear him... <3
Moment I saw the tier lists coming back, I knew we were in for a ride 🔥
not just bikes reference go brrrr
I think we should all use Kelvin for measuring temperature, he seems pretty cool.
Couldn’t be happier abt this News. Especially with cities skylines videos on the horizon :))
I really liked more the stream reactions with submissions so i love that you came back to it, and please keep making things you like
fly high shatt❤
In honor of him making more gaming he should play SpyParty with Ludwig
Why couldn't he leave the country?
Elon musk r u ok? Part 3 coming???
I mean, those TikToks were enough to drive anyone insane. Glad you escaped Schlatt.
I'm so sad that Schlatt passed. Thank god he uploaded one last video before it all ended. RIP
Big moves from a big man, Thank you :D. It sounds like you actually happy to be doing things again instead of boring solo react content. I'm excited :)
We're gonna miss schlatt ruining our day😔 rip king 🕊️
Rest in piss man ❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏🙏
Noooooo!
celcius is better, change my mind.
sclat
this is good
Man, it feels like he's still here with us. RIP Schlatt, can't believe they finally got him.
im looking forward to more content, watching the stream itself was a lot of fun.
Og
schlatt doesn't upload because of what he did on Jan 6
Yo I'm still waiting on my Big Guy hat. Please that's all I want😢
hi shlitt
so shally is it you behind the time to smile channel??
Honestly just make whatever the hell you want, I'll watch it
Ive been watching for almost 7 years big guy, i cant tell you how excited i am that you are finding a way to be happier with your content. Finding fulfillment in your art is incredibly important! I am very happy for you, and im sure everyone else is as well :]
gj shleb
Me when its gonna change:
YES CLASSIC SCHLATT IS BACK IM SO HAPPY 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
One of his last prerecorded videos. Rest in peace Schlop 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏿🙏🏻
Rest in peace Jschlatt well miss you
fly high jshlut🕊️🕊️

October 24th is one day before my birthday lmao
Beverage tierlist?
Instagram post hard
F is fine unless you need to do math with it.
"Schlatt" we will forever miss you.. 🕊❤
schlatt, make whatever kind of content you want, im still gonna watch it regardless. your the big funny guy
I thought they got you bro , why arent you in prison?  (also L opinion Celcius better)
AYYYY BIG GUYS BACK!!! How was jail?
Again Fahrenheit makes just as little sense as Celsius does. 32 sounds like it should be a good one wearing a thin long sleeve BUT ITS FREEZING. 50 sounds like its the perfect temperature warm but not hot and everyone can wear t-shirts. Its not tho, its cold. 86 sounds like you should be melting but its just a little hot and 100 sounds like you should be dead after all its the round 100 but its still just hot. Anything above 100 sounds unreasonable. So both dont make sense OR they only make sense to people that have grown up using them.
still wont forget about what he did to my parents that night in june 1999. rip shat, we will miss you dearly
AIs gotten real good, it's like I'm watching the real schlatt
I am rather excited to hear about this change. My favorite videos of yours were your Day Z streams, so here’s to hoping that those are brought back.
the queen died a year ago today
Yeeeeeaaaaaaaaah no more tikotks!! Whoooo
Rip
RIP Jschlatt, we'll miss you, gone but never forgotten in our hearts for all the stuff you've done to make our days better
Glad to hear it big guy, looking forward to seeing your future projects.
“I’m not in prison, they don’t have enough evidence for that” don’t worry we’ll find more evidence
Finally free from prison! And it's ok big guy we need you to be happy so post whatever we will watch it
Fly high bro we will miss you 🙏
3:22

jshclott you better stay on guard because any move you make could be used as evidence to get you in prison.
THANK FUCK
I almost thought you would let me out of the basement. Hopefully that's next video🙏
Somehow Schlatt's San Francisco is better than the irl one
Two things to live by: Milk the views and stay out of prison
Rest in peace Jlatt.... You will not be missed...
FINALLY SOME GAMING
I am happy schlungus, i hope you are having fun and you should do more videos like Japan trip
That was so funny, can't believe what he did to those kids.
It's good to see you making your time on the Internet better, "Schlatt"

They finally improved the Schlatt AI good enough to make content better than reactions  I'm sure the original Schlatt would've be proud, RIP my guy 😞
this video is cool it doesn't seem like he fucking hates us for once keep up the good work
Everyone is saying you’re dying because that’s a popular joke in streamer communities now apparently
posted 3 minutes ago and already 12k views. wow
763 comments in less in an hour
yo

Schlutt.
Cant believe shalt has finally decided to change from being a psychopath to a sociopath, I support his decision fully
Im so glad Schlatt is back i literally just started wanting to have new content last week so this is fr perfect timing im so excited to see what the big man has planned and I'd also love to see more weekly slapp or stuff like the Japan vlog but thank you Schlatt for being such a fun entertainer
I love the change, i dont mind tho if you make some reactions now and then but we love the change!!!
Dammit.
HI schlatt

I can’t believe Apandah died
RIP “Jschlatt”
so proud of you
Cuteness overload!
I have a close online friend who lives in Germany! Thank god they didnt let you go there.
His reaction videos gave him a thousand yard stare
God, he is still alive?  Love you schlatt 🫶
Yee haw
Ironic that he posted this on the day the queen died
Miks vitus Tampere😂
This reminds me of tapestry theodicy and how it relates to the book of Job
RIP Schlanket man, i'll miss you. You'll always have a place in my heart 💔
Please don't think that we would think you made this video for views if you change your mind and still make those reaction videos - personally I love them. But some people are gonna be there and hate that is guaranteed but whatever you do remember that helping your wellbeing is always the right choice man anyway I gotta get back to the video
The shat man comeback
Ayyy glad to see you back Big Guy! Always look forward to what you do. *insert angry rant about how wrong you are about Celsius 😡*
its not the content that makes us watch the reason is you
ohmygod he’s back!!
getin that bag 🤑💸💸
Rest in peace Schlutt, gour legacy will live on ❤
0:53 nahhh🗿
finally I never really liked the reaction series. I am so happy seing big guy back
WE HAVE BEEN FREEED
1:04 his dead straight face after that statement was so funny
@jschlattlive why are you died?! 😢
Title scared me but I’m excited
Let’s gooooo old schlatt is back
Honestly, I'm all for this big guy, especially if it does bring you more joy
This is the best news I've heard all day "Schlatt"
Best transition to a gameplay video
i killed a man in 2007
You will be missed,❤
Thank god.
"are you water" -Schlumburger     YES
Love this, so excited for the future! Keep doing what makes you happy Schlatt
Celsius is so much better, what even is the base of Fahrenheit? 1000 degrees Fahrenheit is the heat a bullet reaches after firing? Is 1000 Fahrenheit the temperature of burning oil or Californian grass?
The title made me concerned but the video makes me smile
we should raid your house
Miss you schlatt
it's as if hes still here, talking to the camera... Rest in peace jshat <3
I really can't believe he's gone... RIP shack
MORE GAMING LETS FUCKING GOOOOO

FINALLY LETSGOOOOOOOO

Bigman
Its so sad to hear schlatt died due to bleeding to death from the 29 self inflicted stab wounds in his prison cell by a makeshift shiv. You will be missed ❤

Dammit we could’ve seen Mart and Shlatt together
We knew this was coming....😮
rest in peace schat
Thank you Schlatt's family for continuing to upload viedos after Schlatt's horrific murder on August 12, 2023. It's almost like I can still hear his voice
I’ll miss the reaction videos, but you deserve happiness too <3
Jcum
It’s actually kind of nice seeing “Schlatt” return to his original content tbh, because it has been dearly missed
SO glad joopscoop is finally changing his facial hair, it was about time 🤮❤
Rest in peace omungbus, i've always cherished your videos, i send my condolences to you and your loved ones. ❤

Nice
RIP shag
I love you schlatt 😐
whatever you decide to make in the future, big guy, im sure will be fantastic. your on-screen personality makes whatever you’re a part of enjoyable. do what makes you happy. and also what makes a large amount of money.

this will never “change”, shat. we’ll still support you even while you’re in prison.
kelvin on top
l watch you every day
I'm honestly excited for the change that "Jscat" has decided on
This video makes me wanna goon
it makes me excited to see that schlatt is gonna start doing more of what he wants, i personally dont really enjoy content unless the person enjoys making it, So im excited that schlatt is gonna enjoy the content he wants to make.
Good video👍
are you supposed to be in germany rn
Bros tryna tell us Fahrenheit’s better without any reason 💀
I'm lowkey happy about this change and I think most of us prefer if you're actually enjoying what you're doing, instead of the bland money farming mr beast videos everyone makes nowadays, people definitely prefer genuine content. keep it up big guy
WOOOO more Schlatt streams = no more depression
I can still remember when Jonathan Schlattonathan was here and spreading love and joy, may he rest in peace. Amen
FRIST11!!11
shlongus
I'm the first dislike. Not because I disliked the video, but to keep you humble Jermaine Shlogg.
Don't care show me the new cat
FINALLY NO MORE TIKTOK
3 minutes ago and its already a classic
I hope you are getting better shat
Bro stfu i am watching rugby rn
Okay
100 is boil, 0 is freeze, Celsius is just sensical. Fahrenheit is daft.
Rest in piece schlatty boy.
glad schlatt is coming back to his greatest era, can’t wait to see what’s in store!!
glad to have you back from prison big guy
holy hell we have finally been released from the tik tok reaction purgatory
That last reaction video was so awful that you really deserve a 2 year brake
missing you rip 🙏🙏💔
This is the best news of my fucking life…good to have you back schlatt :)
Yay jshat is back.                                Idk I did not watch the hole videoe
TikTok videos are only for when Schlatt has literally no ideas left.
can’t believe they uploaded this before what he did in 1999 (schlatt let my family go please)
Please play more Spy Party!
you wanna know what we want? more ok computer song breakdowns
Hooray Jschlenis is back 🎉
THANK YOU I HATED THE FAKE REACTIONS TO TIK TOK

Honestly, I was tired of the tiktok reaction vids. XD Glad your doing more stuff!
hope you doing good big guy... will be praying for ya 🩷
"177 views, 356 comments" damn
Kelvin is best and that is a fact
Thank God that you're swapping off of reactions, I love your content that takes more than a braincell to understand, although good on you for abusing that bs
Your back yippee
Oh boy, I can't wait for another year of Jschliggles milking an idea for months on end.
okay but fahrenheit is better 😮‍💨
Thank fuck we're done with this shit
I miss it already beat series ever
Can't believe it's been one year since "Schlatt" took out The Queen  🎉
Oh
I’ll remember your beard slightly 🙏🙏🙏

How nice of "Schlatt" to "pre record" videos before his "death"  Its almost like he's still here
“Schlatt” you’re pretty good at this youtube thing, very excited for this new era of *Schlontent*
You're pc setup ratings were straight bangers hope you'll do more of that as well
just at the start and yeah true lmao
MEOW

jschlatt can we start a family together
Genuinely love how honest schlatt is about stuff like this. Hoping other youtubers act like this in the future, youtube and making content should be about fun and not just about money.
NO MORE TIKTOKS!!!! LESGOOO
"I'm not in prison, they don't have enough evidence" what a nice way to say "I killed every witness"
Im so sad that you stopped youtube because you are homeless now and have aids ❤
just realized we got the same birthday lol
LET'S GO, missed you big man,  happy to know you'll be streaming again!❤️
Schleet: "No more TikTok videos"  Also Schlant in a week: "Reacting To Your Outrageous Crimes!!!"

Hi

Rip shlagget😢
I don't care, and i'm twerking!
:(
Can’t wait for you to bring back mebeb and bonk :)
Celsius better

Schlatt is about to milk the “I’m leaving” and “I’m back” genres instead
Ah yes, the yearly "Schlatt" rebrand. You love to see it
Rest in peace schlott you will be missed ❤🕊
I don't care, and i'm twerking!
Finally I don't have to pretend that that type of content wasn't the most bare bones soulless money chasing type I know schlatt for.
Finally, Schlatt’s back from the dead! (He had to double tap the souls of his victims from ‘99)
l'm your fan
Schlatt really only changes anything regarding his online brand when it is at risk of being scrutinized.
I don't care, and i'm twerking!
Damn Schlatt, i didnt expect you to finally admit what you did back in 98.
HELL YEAH!!! i’m so excited to see what’s to come!
here for this new era of doing what you want!! including any crimes!!! <3 happy to be here big guy
Nice to know you’ll be gooning 24/7 now
I don't care, and i'm twerking!
Schlatt is back
All for money am I right? Right?
WE’RE SO BACK 🔥
I won’t lie dude I never really liked your reaction videos but I loved the video where you brought a bunch of you Youtubers to play Wii games so I hope you do that again but I’m also very happy to hear that you’re gonna be streaming again
Me like 👍
Metal sarcophagus!
I was getting a bit tired of them too. I can't wait to see what you do next, "Shlorputt"
I haven’t been a fan for long, but i’m so happy to be here during this time
I don't care, and i'm twerking!
WE WANT MORE
You could clip your toenails one molecule at a time and it would still be entertaining
I like how he didn't mention his small singing career
It’s so sad to see you back🎉
I don't care, and i'm twerking!
This “Schlart” guy thinks he can run away from the long flabby arm of the law
Do what ever you want if you don't want to make those vids anymore then do what you want
I don't care, and i'm twerking!
Shlatt’s about to change things like how he changed Europe back in 99’
🛠 CHECK OUT CITIES: SKYLINES 2! https://play.citiesskylines.com/schlatt 🛠 And guys I didn't die. Why are you saying rest in peace?
I honestly want Schlatt to do sequels to the past reactions and tier lists he has done and if you say why? What do you mean why it’s entertaining
I’m glad you decided to do what you want to do !!!
I can’t wait for this!!! ❤❤good luck Schlatt :))
Do whatever makes you happy big guy. As long as you dont come to my house and beat me to death
I don't care, and i'm twerking!
Schlatt never fails to fill us up with content.
hmmmmmmm smiling less maybe its a time to smile or even think
HES BACK
The tiktok reaction videos are fun and always enjoyable to watch; but I’m glad you’re moving on to bigger and better things. <3
jschlatt is dead guys this is just an AI cover of a video that was also made by an AI

City skyline is coming put on my birthday
Don’t worry Schlatt, reaction videos are shit but we will forgive you for making them, all because of your actions you made one year ago today❤️
Nice

We hate you schlatt ❤
This is certainly a change from Schlungkly.

"Schlatt..."        Why is everyone commenting random stuff 😭??
I don't care, and i'm twerking!
i just wish we had the "reacting to basements"
MISSED U BIGMAN🙏🙏‼️
The last time Schlatt has said “Things are about to change” is before he put a crack in the Titan submersible
I don't care, and i'm twerking!
fuck celsius!!!! (been living in a celsius place for a month and still can’t comprehend it)
3 more days till the fateful day
Ive been waiting for this day for a little over a year huzzah!!!
i cant believe Schlatt is gay for real now
He came out as trans. We love him. Don't watch the video and Is correct man
FUCKING EARLY
Rest In Peace Jschlatt... it was fun while it lasted.
gail
Its fine man. You dont gotta feed the reaction brain rot train.
I love how “Schlatt” (RIP) has so many play buttons he made modern art out of them. He sure did deserve it. Too bad he’s not with us anymore to enjoy them.
Glad to see you’re back with more content that you actually like, that definitely will affect the quality for the better
pee pee
RIp
jatt no longer makin the dickcock vids whar the flip!! 😭😭😭😭
we will miss you shatt😔
It’s like he’s still here. We will miss you shatt ❤ 🕊️
Finally the big guy is truly back
ok
i like cheese burgers
WOOOOOO, you got this big guy!
Just get ai jschaltt to do the tiktoky reactions, it would be passive income at that point
“And no, The answer is not prison. They don’t have enough evidence for that.” Classic Shlatt.
I would literally just want to watch you play anything schlatt. I don't watch your videos for tiktok reactions or wii games specifically, I watch your videos for you!
Is he gonna shave the chops???
b
Schlatt ran out of tik tok videos
it's like I can still hear him
fly high brother 🪶🪶🪶
This is way to early
oh no!!
its funny how you posted this on the day the queen died. schlatt are you trying to tell us something?
Yay :)
Early gang
CITY SKYLINES WHAT
R.I.P. Schlegg at least there are old videos still being posted 😞🙏🕊️
Schlatt never fails to disappoint 😊
Damn that’s crazy. Rip Schlutt
Glad to see it champ.
THANK GOD
Schlarg
He’s got a point, I’m am a loser lol
W man
Video idea: jambo part 2 with the other cat (we learn his name)
"schlatt" is changing things up apparently (still have watched the video)
Wtf
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
wow a good announcement…..
I wouldn't think back in 1999 that "jschlatt" is still not in prison. 😬
W
I am glad that the submissions reactions will be returning
CANDY TIERLIST!!
thank you lizard
I cannot believe that “Jschlatt” would admit to his heinous acts in 1999 like that, truly despicable that someone would do something like this and I hope all the victims friends and families find comfort knowing that he is currently being apprehended by a global police force.
is the old shlatt gonna come back???
wth is this
About time, those tik took reactions were starting to get cringe
Could this be a schlankett announcement?
WE'RE FREEE!!!!!
More change?
Boo
The last time there was a change it was in 99
Father ❤
enough said it sounds like a great idea so far🫡🫡🫡
Yippee! Schlatt rants are truly gospel
my god he finnally noticed his mistakes! linus tech tips style !
I'm happy that "Schlatt" is going to "do" more things that he "enjoys"
Dude posted this on the anniversary of the incident
Oh thank God
LETS GO WOO I LOVE THE REACTION STREAMS BUT WOO
Shlott
So sad that he is gone, we will all miss him very much❤
Glad things are changing
men
Please no run out of money please be you  Please buy more guns
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WHAT DO YOU MEAN NO TIKTOKS ANYMORE???????? WHERE THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO FIND GOOD CONTENT FROM THERE???????????????????????
YIPPEE!!!!!!!!!!!
BRO THE TIKTOKS WERE THE ONLY THING THAT I LIKED WTF BRO   CMON MAN
great news boys
i cant believe he's moving to cuba, it's crazy....
