oh nah boy pull up imma boom u for  talking about zenyatta like that in your promotion
The disrespect to bastin…. I get over 30k damage every round in comp….
You forgot ramatet
GOD loves you enough to send HIS only SON to save you and if you repent and turn from your sins and be baptized in THE NAME OF THE FATHER, THE SON and THE HOLY SPIRIT. ((if you haven't )
No sigma 😭😭
Are there any plans for more hero’s I don’t stay informed to much lol
Way better video than stylosa his video didn't show any footage of the heros so shitty ! Keep up the great work
Way better video than
Allot of heros? Allot of damage heros*!
I main roadhog, awful to see this. The need to add new characters now. And not damage characters!!!
What about bastion
I’d just say play the characters you like these are just his opinions.
what about sigma because hes an high a or s tier for me
The only thing I genuinely disagree with is Moira. Imo shes the best healer and a carrier
bro just doesn't like that sigmas Dogs are out
Am I dumb or did he skip the rock guy in tank category
13:08
7:50
Bro said zarya is S tier 💀 I hate playing with zarya everyone in low elo is so bad it makes it impossible to play with.
No sigma?
where's sigma
this tier list is no bueno ngl
sigma?????????????????????????????????????/   Hello??????
I am surprised Moira is so low but whenever I play Moira she is playing dps rather than support.
Tanks: D: Roadhog, Junker Queen C: Rein, Wrecking Ball B: Doomfist, Orisa, Winston A: None  S: DVA, Zarya  Support: D: None C: Moira B: Mercy A: Zenyatta, Bridgitte S: Ana, Baptiste, Lucio  DPS: D: Bastion C: Symetra     B: Cassidy, Hanzo, Pharah, Torbjorn, Junkrat, Mei A: Widowmaker, Tracer, Soldier, Reaper, Echo, Ashe  S: Sombra, Soujorn, Genji  ~No Kiriko ~No Sigma
The fact that this guy didn’t put ANY ACTUAL TIER LIST AT ANY POINT IN THE VIDEO IS SO ANNOYING
you forgot sigma
I think you forgot sigma
What about sigma
Road hog deserves more respect
I think this game is set up to where you can excel with any character at any point in time.. It seems with each and every character you can go on a rampage one game and completely plummet the next with the same character.
Where's sigma?
Where sigma?
Sigma is nuts...period
Where is sigma
Me a bastion main: damn
Bro really just forgot my main. Sigma mains rise up!
I have made amazing plays with road hog and I’m surprised he got super low because I have killed people with healers with road hog I’m disappointed but it’s fine
Imma be honest, this is a really bad tier list. Becausehe didn’t put everyone in, and because all tier lists are up to opinion, and every character in overwatch is viable and you can make them good if you just play enough with them
Winston is 100% S+++
Torb is an easy A-S tier
Bro forgot sigma
Bro said Mira is c tier
haHAA
Sigma is crying in the corner
Where is sigma??? I’m new to this game and you didn’t mention my favorite character at the moment
Just started playing. Got my 40th win so I'll most likely unlock ranked mode after i play tomorrow. Cod, halo, apex player. I play lucio, zenyatta, ashe, sojourn, and roadhog. I CANT STAND dva. Shit is so broken. Not a game goes by where she doesn't triple kill with the ult. Gets me everytime when it flys in my face. Unlocked Baptiste right as i got off. Wanna play him tomorrow badly.
Where is sigma
Forgot Sigma, lol
Bro these ratings are rough
Ive been playing this game for a week with little to no sleep and imo this list is very inaccurate. I dont want to sound hateful but id say anyone watching this should make their own opinion. Plus it is missing some heroes.
GOOD MONKE DOESNT WEAR PANTS GO WINSTON!
7:29 "...and her *boobs* provide lots of peel for her friendly..." Look at texting haha
Sigma?????
Uptf😊  CB B
I feel like this is mostly inaccurate
WHERE IS SIGMA
doomfist is easily much worse than hog rn
Man said sym was C tier 😂
Where sigma 😂
Not too bad a list. I think your DPS one was pretty much perfect though I think Bastion is at least B imo but your placement of Moira and Doomfist don't sit right wit me. Having to use the excuse "A good player makes them work" should never be brought up in a tier list because that isn't how you compare the character. He's notoriously a joke of a tank and even the best Doom says he needs help. He's the worst tank imo. Moira I personally think is not the worst healer. I think she's one of the best. Maybe top 3
Main sombra💀here👇
YOU FORGOT SIGMA
Moriah underrated asf, just had a 26 kill almost 10k dmg and almost 13k healing
Where kiriko?
You can tell this guy doesn’t know what he’s talking about, doom fist is the worst tank in the game. Don’t buy his guides lol
Sigma???
Why didnt you rank some heroes? I noticed you missed Sigma and Junkrat
Roadhog is so underrated
You missed out sigma and kiriko😅
I didnt Saw the vídeo yet. But i will continue to main hanzo anyway.
Damn fam never really thought hog would be the least ranked character
BRUH this guy fr put doomfist all the way up in B tier LMFAO, and doesnt even mention Sigma. Between this and ranking Moira all the way down in C tier, would recommend not taking this tier list seriously if youre new, I cant watch anymore
I never played overwatch before, tried overwatch 2 for the first time yesterday and I played with genji cuz he looked cool and I actually like him, but you tell me I picked the best damage character by accident 🤣
No offense I lost faith in this tier list when I saw roadhog
Idk bout you but I crush with hanzo got 20 solo kills one game and potg
Umm whats wrong with sigma
Totally just forgot sigma :(
They did Moira dirty. She's the main healer I use and if you mainly heal with the orbs instead of the stream it's alot more effective. I get tons of damage, kills, and healing with Moira and i love her evasive move it does great when being pressed and you need some space between you and the other team without taking damage. If your smart Moira is chefs kiss🤌🏻
The Moira downplay is crazy
I made an acc memeing the accounts spamming and i put a real creators thingy on my page check it out. Thank me later.
Why does he sound like that voice from FNAF 5
Did he forget about sigma or am I dumb?
what is cc?
Did I missed something, or he did not mention Sigma in the tanks?
I've only played this game for like 18 hours now and I love Moira! Her ability to get away in hairy situations has saved me so many times.
Sigma, kiriko, hanzo???
orisa is deff not B... at least A if not S cuz g0d damn... do i whoop some ass with my rookie skills and orisa.. just sayin.. humbly 🤣🤣
parah is a tier
nah u cappin, ill beat all yal with my rh lmfao
Sigma?
bro forgot about sigma  🤣
God you sound like archer/bob
alright i knew u were full of shit when u ranked torbshit at b 🤦🏿‍♂️
It's Bridge-it. No Bragetta.
Where the hell is kiriko
Just spam tank characters that what I do,, I win most of my matches useing them, and I never ever play low health squishy characters because they die far too fast
How come there are so many clips online of the enemy colors being blue and teammates being red?
This mfs opinions are more invalid than his marriage
Simma and kirku?
I see everyone talking about how you ranked Moira weird, but honestly I'm saying the same for Winston. The fuck do you mean he can't chew through support heals? I have never had any issue removing supports from the game with him. If you can't do it, idk what to tell you. You're clearly not making use of his dps
Just picked up mercy first time playing and I'm having a blast
I'm going to respectfully disagree on this. Doomfist is not in B tier.
can someone tell the narrator to blow his nose before recording
you missed sigma
Bro ur tier list is all over the fucking place.
Rip Sigma Mains 💀
Junker queen in D tier so rude...
where is sigma he’s my main😢
As a brand new player who has no clue what's any good, appreciate
Even if roadhog is d tier he’s still so fun to play
Kiriko left the chat*
I don't care what anyone says Sombrero needs a nerf
not a fan of this narrator
Did you forget about Sigma?
they really nerfed all genji's counters mei, Mcree, sym,
MY DAD PLAT IN SOPPORT 2 I BRONZE SAD DAYSSSSSSS
Stopped watching after seeing moira on c tier 💀
Nah roadhog bottom teir is bs I've been a roadhog main since 2017 and I've loved playing him his hook and heal is really good
Just forgot Sigma.  Except of this... Im one of the best Tanks of Europe at time and I need to say your tanktierlist is pretty trash.
Sigma ?
I swear DVA can just eat way too much dmg. It just seems endless.
B tier orisa? Are you nuts?
Ig sigma just doesn’t exist? Cool
What about sigma??
Moira is amazing but no one can play her, they either play her pure DPS or pure Healing while moira is a hero who needs to do BOTH (but def prio healing tho)
What I don’t get is why sojourn builds charge from shorting shields
7:31 Her WHAT revives..... ?
How tf is hog weak?! He’s nearly impossible to kill without taking out the healers first Edit: yeah the whole ranking of tanks is pretty off… I think he’s ranking it based off of how he performs with the characters and not including what it’s like playing AGAINST them.
It's amazing that people think there's real money value in learning to play a game from someone else.
Ain’t no way roadhog is d
im new to overwatch 2 but i played overwatch 1 until 2018 so i have no idea about alot of heroes but so far my favourite one so far is wrecking ball but im incredibly bad with him and my teamates and friends tell me im better off playing sombra or zen so im confused whether i should stick for hamster man or zen/sombra
as a zarya main the bubble rework made her so much better and able to do way more dps and actually take damage and be a tank while still being able to support teammates
I wonder why he didn’t call Winston Winston
sigma ? he doesnt exist ?
Sombra is insane lol
Where's sigma?
As a Moira main I can kill roadhogs on 1v1s if you know how to use her movement and her balls 😂, you can also use the healing ball to heal your teammates and yourself while you're pushing and if you know how to use them you can save your team with them so I'd give her A tier
Junker Queens my favourite hero rn 😭
sigma?
my mains are all top of meta this season is gonna be funnnn
this list is ass lol
Moira is definitely not C tier
I guess Sigma doesn't exist 😂😂😂
I honestly don't think there's a tier list except for Doomfist 😂. even Doomfist it depends on players and maps also. sometimes tanks feel op, some other times they're a joke so it's really random
am i tripping or did he miss sigma
No Sigma here?
First time i ser someone put df B or above. In the most tierlist i see he is D - F like flats tier list
¸I disagree a bit. Im a master player.  Doomfist is like 5 levels below of the rest, and I never really seen Doom picked in masters. Dva is a beast too unless she faces Zarya or Sombra, there is nothing to stop her. As DPS Genji and Soujourn are super op so I must agree with you.. And about sombra.. It really depends on the team and on a map while with one nano blade you can wipe out the entire team and win the match
Tracer is horrible. I mean horrible. Sinatra, super and others ex pros all have said tracer is beyond useless
Game needs less damage
People doing a tier list, but not putting the entire tier list in the video on one page.   Dislike.
You forgot about Sigma...
Man forgot sigma
Him just calling him a Monkey is crazy
Worst tier list ever lol. Has this guy even been playing game???
bro forget sigma=atleast a tier
The meta changes with whatever mythic skin they try to peddle
Moira is insane.
is it worth to play cassidy if i drop like 45-55 kills 15k dmg every game?
Where’s kiriko
Ummm what did he say about sombra??😳😳
My ow1 mains: Zarya, Dva, ana, lucio, genji and sombra 😅
this tier list has no sense. How can you say Zarya is S and DVA is S? When the fact that zarya is S makes DVA fall cause Zarya counter DVA since day one bro. Then DVA mechanically fall some tiers because of that. How can Winston and Moira be B tier when they full counter your meta S tier list (genji etc..). Guys just dont listen to this kind of trashs
Doom is way too high
Genji for life

roadhog in D tier is disrespectful
I 100% in love with this much effort they always made me and my family happy so
Orisa that low 💀
F YouTube for sending me this
So no one is even talking about sigma . cool cool cool cool
What about Sigma?
Just here to say Fuck the new sombra
Roadhog is very underrated
How is Moira’s ult better in OW2? She didn’t get any changes from what I’ve heard
wait where is sigma
No sigma on the tier list?
Tanks: D: Roadhog, Junker Queen C: Rein, Wrecking Ball B: Doomfist, Orisa, Winston A: None  S: DVA, Zarya  Support: D: None C: Moira B: Mercy A: Zenyatta, Bridgitte S: Ana, Baptiste, Lucio  DPS: D: Bastion C: Symetra     B: Cassidy, Hanzo, Pharah, Torbjorn, Junkrat, Mei A: Widowmaker, Tracer, Soldier, Reaper, Echo, Ashe  S: Sombra, Soujorn, Genji  ~No Kiriko ~No Sigma (but in my opinion, he is S tier but I am definitely biased) I don't know why people cant just put something like this at the end of their videos or in their description or in a link or something. But yeah boys, leave a like so more people can see this!
Brigitte A 🤨
I keep seeing everyone saying moria is low tier but she constantly does more dmg and heals than dps and supports
Mercy is straight f tier fact you said moira is worse is insane
Where is sigma
Where’s sigma?
add a chart dude, no one has the time to watch all this!!!! dislike :(
Moira in C, not in Diamond or below, she’s causing havoc down here!!
Where is sigma dude
Did you forget about sigma
Just wondering, why did you forget about Sigma?
You forgot sigma and kiriko
Why did he miss Sigma? 🤔🤔
No sigma
Bro said Orissa ult is good, huuuuhhhh. It's so easy to counter... Just.. walk away
Homeboy forgot Sigma xD
dude WWWWWWWWWWHAT are you smoking
Yo dawg, where is sigma?
you left out sigma
sick vid, good lookin out
Where is sigma
Everyone thinking it’s crazy to put df in B when he’s not bad, just the players are shitters. People still try to play him like a dps, doom fist went from one of the most selfish heroes to one of the most selfless. You’re supposed to do all the crazy jumping and punching but it’s to allow your teammates to get the kill. You play doom to make your team look good and give them the space they need. Most df players don’t understand this.   Sure he’s not as strong as dva or zarya rn but saying he’s bottom tier is a typical df player cope.
Bli$$ard €nt€rtainment
You completely forgot about sigma
Rip sigma
I can say as someone who likes playing reaper, the buff to his spread and there being less CC makes him so much more fun to play
am i blind cause i don't see sigma
Sigma?
Imagine putting moira in c
I guess sigma isn’t real
Is Kiriko S tier as well?
For the mercy portion, how were you staying afloat like that?
Skill issue
I guess sigma doesn’t exist anymore lol
idk wat *crack* you were taking while making that thumbnail 💀
WAIT are you serious.. mercy over moira? Look, I’m a former mercy main and I love her but moira definitely edges out mercy in comp right now 😂
How is Doomfist B? Doomfist is literally the worst hero right now next to Mccree
Kiriko??
Just play tracer/genji, apparently no one can kill them
Sigma has left the chat
Sombra being such a menace and very very VERY easy to play just sucks, also lucid has no skill other than a roll out now, I have less than 2 hours with him and he gets aways with crazy stuff (this is on console BTW and this game with no blizzard devs actually playing console OW as they know its a money Milker and not worth balancing for console, I mean mnk runs rampant on every fps game with a rank so basically the community I.E. you are not worth it to them) Any one stuck in an endless loop playing this game stuck in the same rank I beg you to quit and do something productive. Chivalry 2 let's you chops enemy heads off and cheer with it, already better than ow2.
WHERE IS SIGMA
Bro I can't stand these tier list, just play who you want and get good. I swear you got people who watch these videos then never touch other characters because it isn't the "meta"
where is sigma???
Stopped as soon as I saw Orisa in B. She's totally busted.
The two things I'm thankful for from the changes was the changes in both Bastion and Orisa. But I do hate the new shop where you have to just be on Overwatch 2 a lot just to see if the specific skin you want is available for purchase. It's a bit of a money grabbing scheme but what's Blizzard gonna do about ppl complaining about it? If it were up to me I'd make it so you could still purchase skins during the event instead of waiting for them to just appear in the store 🙄
What about kiriko?
The way he said Brigitte killed me lmao
Bro forgot doomfist and sigma
You skipped sigma...
sigma? maybe watch your video before you post it
I’m sorry but ain’t no way Doomfist is better than rein
Bro didn’t even include sigma
Sigma?
eh the tier list makes no sense?
2 15second ads is outrageous
This overview is incomplete, you forgot Sigma, gj you fooled yourself...
I think orissa needs nerfs as spinning the spear makes her immortal from the front and I'm finding her in every match
did he just forgot sigma?
No but in what world are orisa and doom fist the same tier. Maybe we’re playing different games
Hey what about sigma? Where would he be placed as a tank?
You forgot sigma
Mercy is definitely tough and completely dependent on your DPS. But I feel like with a great team, she's more of a A-tier and you can really elevate the team overall.
have you guys checked out this amazing overwatch 2 gameplay video? it's mind blowing    watch the live streaming here:   video 1: https://7r6.com/oveRwatch2   video 2:https://7r6.com/overwaTch2
this list is so fucking wrong lmao, who made this? it feels like this person doesn't play the same game at all
Where Sigma
Uhhh where Sigma at??
Where sigma at?
Woulda been helpful if you just made a graphic damn bro
Roadhog is S or A tier. He is not low.I dont recommend any new players to listen to this video
Are you talking out of your nose?
When did the voice person change this dudes voice is real boring
Reapers ultimate is broken
genji s tier LOL l2p trash moira player
Is it me, or he just completely ignore Sigma and Kiriko?
allo he forgot to rate sigma!!!
Bastiok D tier?? Lmao Never trust this channel since he rates R301 below the flatline in Apex Legends
Sigma ?
No sigma?
wheres sigma? hes better then rein in this game
Sigma 😢
Worst tier list i have ever seen
Soldier 76 is not A tier... I been playing and his nerfs are horrible
What about Sigma and Kiriko? Where do they place?
Sigma??????????
No sigma?
I think you forgot Sigma
what about sigma?
You forgot to put sigma in this ranking but I would say A tier and S tier on some maps
Doomfist over Wrecking ball is crazy
Um... where is sigma?
What about Sigma?
WHY ARE THE ENEMY NAMES BLUE AND TEAM NAMES RED WHYYYYYY
My boy put doom in B tier and I’ve seen him in F tiers in everyone else’s tier list video 😭
Am I stupid. Where is sigma
moira goooooooooooooooodddddddddddddddddddddddddd
Did not think that you have to pick Ash and Bob in a Moira Brawlcomp but here we are.
Wait Where is SIGMA ???
L
As a Moira player, I don't know what you're talking about. 130 hp/s aoe heals is kinda crazy. I've saved teammates caught in Zarya's grav that were being focused, outhealed Genji blades, etc. She has amazing burst healing and one of the best escape abilities in the game with fade.
3:41 BRO WHAT??? LOOK AT THE BOTTOM LEFT
Where the heck is sigma?
"pro guides" xD these tier list are garbage nowadays.... and this is the worst i found. clueless
no shot u put roadhog in d tier he has always been s tier n that will never change the fact u have 600h self heals n can 1tap is enough until they remove 1tap combo he will always be broken
Highway I respect you but you have some L takes here Mercy is op, Doom is not a B he is a D, Moria is really good most of the time because the game is dive heavy right now with genii and sojourn .
Ok so Sigma doesn't exist I guess.
To be honest road hoad is like alot better for me as i play him a little less tanky but more like "GOTCHA BITCH" and then shoot them down with the team its quite a nice strategy ive been using it for a while
Wtf are you smoking putting Hog in D tier? Most health in the game and has the heal ability..have seen good Road Hog players 1 v2 and 1 v 3 people.. almost every tier list I've seen has him in A tier you are hella wrong about Hog js.. Then you have Doom fist in B tier 🤣 anyone who plays and knows this game know that character is bottom tier rn.. Also absolutely no one is under the assumption reaper is a low tier pick... prob the worst tier list I've seen so far man lol
Sigma?
This list has to be a joke.
I'm supriced that Kiriko was not mentioned
What do you mean roadhog is invincible
bro forgot sigma and kiriko
where is sigma lol
Incredible L list, idk how you got so much wrong and so much right simultaneously
Forgot sigma
doom fist b teir? Yeah that's a no for me bud
doom D tier ? he shouldn't be even on the list xD
No bap is definitely not underrated
Where is Sigma?
Wait did he forget sigma or am I trippin??!! Sigma imo is GOATED rn!
Not sure what you are talking about RoadHog. He’s one of the best tanks imo
he forgot Sigma ;-;
Where is sigma?
Haha, wow! This seems like a roll of the dice ranking imo. Roadhog and Symmetra NOT A-S tier!? Seems the creator here hasnt played at too high of level or for not long anyways. Both mentioned are a NIGHTMARE in the hands of a good player.
Who is Cassady I only now maccree
This is the worst teir list I’ve seen so man, how in the world can you say that hog has bad sustain
Dude said moria is c tier lmfao dont trust anything  you say anymore
Didnt see sigma rated, imo hes the best tank 🤷‍♂️
Ha ur a joke
He forgor Sigma
Idc how many tier lists call Queen bad, she's far and away the most fun character to play and I'm gonna spam her til I'm done with this game lol
Honestly i am kinda sad that roadhog is in the lowest tier wince i love playing him so much but everything u said was true
I could agree with everything but moira is S tier
doom is WAY worse than hog lol
7:31 ... Brigs ... Boobs..? Provide healing? Agreed
I honestly see Lucio a bit lower and Moira much higher personally. Moira can keep herself alive for a long time and she can be the factor in ensuring kills.  I think Bastion is more a B tier, when playing with the team he can output a lot of damage though I don't like his ult as it gives the enemy too much time to react and it doesn't zone people for more than a couple seconds.
mercy over  moira is the biggest cap moira is way to strong at the moment
Sigma?
come on... rein is bad because he has no mobility vs zarya s tier with similar lack of mobility... most players play in gold and plat while i have a feeling that your ranking is based on much higher rank. in average low plat games as moira (c tier xD) you can easily have the most heals and most dmg out of entire team and as we know she is not a utility hero so plain numbers speak the most...
What about Sigma
No Sigma?
yo did i miss something where tf was sigma????
I’m new to overwatch with overwatch 2 thank I saw this. I main road hog. 12 hours with him and I have a 2.55 edr with him. But knowing he’s bottom tier I’ll find someone better.
didnt think ana would be so high up with it being genji meta, I know she likes to nanoblade and all, but the enemy genji just wont let her rest and rely on her new support passive
Bastion os actually very good imo. He just needs to play mostly at mid to long range.  Also he's hurt by kiriko not being in competitive yet.  If she tags him to be immune in tank form he's a real problem to deal with.
Roadhog is nearly unstoppable if you know how to use him right
In my opinion I think Doom Fist and Rhodhog are in The same tier a D Doom Fist is Tank but he doesn't Tank for team but for him self to hunt make support and DPS have to take care themselves more than necessary and if the enemy doing a flanking like Sombra or Reaper your back line gonna die + Doom fist is not that hard to kill he is big and his defensive skill is not good as other tank sure he has high mobility but what you gonna do your Damage output Require you to take damage first so you can puch hard even that you are not get Kill confirm except throw enemy out of the edge and his ult just make the team a lot harder to play gone for about 3 second I mean you are tank and you off the map your support gonna die first and the damage of meteor strike is not that impactful Rhodhog can do better than that
Ball is A tier if you actually learn how to use him
idk if its different at grandmaster, but this list is basically upside down
My buddy was decimating with road hog
Did you forget Sigma?
shit tier tier list
Orisa and doom same tier. You're high bro 😭🤣 doom is super hard to play to get even close to the level that a literal bot on orisa can put out.
Where is mah boi sigma
Sigma is way too mutch of a Sigma male to be featured in any of categorie, he has his own category for that
You know this guy lost credibility when he said doom is B tier 💀
You forgot Kiriko but she's also an S Tier support in the right hands
No way you put doom over rein. I don’t think I’ve seen a single doom post masters lol.
roadhog is meta with kiriko.  just wait and see
Im pretty new to ow. Maybe 20h gametime🤷🏻‍♂️ Coming from Apex after 8 season.. Testing many Heroes.. dd and Support.. soldier looks solid for me, tracking is no problem after so many hours of Apex 😄 but im in Love with kiriko and Moira🤷🏻‍♂️😄 i can see y shes (Moira) a Low Tier, in Higher Ranks ☝🏻.. but in Low - mid Ranks shes pretty strong (i think)
no kiriko?
Hard disagree on D-tier junker queen. See's awesome when you get comfortable. Damage, sustain and pure aggression. Doomfist stinks of raw piss, not B. Crazy how perspectives change. (mid plat player opinions).
Get better with the tanks
Too bad game gets boring after 3 matches
I could not disagree with this list more.  Some of these tier lists at the start of ow2 make less sense than any since the beginning of the game.
Doomfist good tank hahaha
Hog in D is absolutely ridiculous lol
I think its weird how people want the tier list to fit exactly like there opinion when it's your opinion. why don't people make their own tier list at that point lol
No sigma?
He forgott Sigma No?
U didn't review Kiriko
I think genji needs a decent nerf. Same with zarya. At this point they’re in 100% of my games
What happened to sigma?
Sorry where' sigma in the tank tier list ?
Where is sigma?
Watch out for that Toxic Roadhog though 👀
i dont think lucio is that good
Is it just me or did he forget my boi sigma
Bruh, where is sigma?! Lol
Wrecking Ball is easily A tier possibly S tier. He out dps most characters while being unkillable and massively disruptive.   I carry so many games in OW2 as a ball main. You said there are better choices but nobody does what a good Hammond can do.   The swing slam shoot combo easily picks squishies. His alt is the best and charges so fast as you do a swing, slam, shield threw the whole enemy team.
sigma kiriko?
Sigma missing
U forgot sigma
You think Moira is just OK? I think she does a ton of damage and also a decent amount of healing and I want her to have one or the other
People who say Genji is meta is a fucking loser lmao
Has this guy even played the game like this list needs some work
everyone has their own meta 😵‍💫
Just so hard to make list because each tier list will change based on rank or if it’s comp or organized play
Wheres sigma?
Where is Kiriko?
where is sigma in the tank role?
Trash guide! How can you be making a overwatch tier list and trying to get people to subscribe to your site when you forget hero’s?
reaper strong because zarya so popular :)
Sombra is definitely an A tier hero . COMPLETELY dependent on the enemy team being mispositioned and all over the place .
Moira is the best healer there is.
I'll tell you how to get good without paying a monthly subscription, practice.  You're all welcome.
Bruh. Moira. That’s inaccurate. She fucking insane.
Moira A tier mercy C tier
to be honest, im disagree with ur opinion man its wrong
Where is sigma?
What the hell is this teir list? Doomfist B teir? lol that’s a hot take
Why is kiriko not in the list?
No sigma in tanks?
Bro forgot to put in Sigma ☠️
C tier moira. wtf. you are crazy.
Where the hell is Sigmas placement
No kiriko??
Whats sigma
ana cooldown buff? Her sleep has 15 seconds now and her nade don't last longer. The only buff was only self heal.
For me junker queen is a c tier tank. Sure her use to the team has been denied but she's still fun to play with
Maybe I’m just not seeing it, but Junker Queen is on everyone’s low tier lists, yet I made it to Diamond only using her. “Kiriko hard counters her” true, but she can’t be used in competitive currently. TLDR, Junker Queen is slept on and is a powerhouse if you know how to play her properly
I think Moira is a lot better than you think. But I've seek so much variety in how people are ranking characters right now.
Orisa go brrr brrr trrr trrr. Like if u agree😛
Stopped three minutes in.  This tier list is a train wreck.  Saying zen is good when he gets deleted by any dive hero.  Winston isn’t good? Ya that’s enough watching for me.
I'd say Doomfist is a D tier. He straight up doesn't work as a support and his new block ability sucks.
Did he say where sigma is?
did they just forget Sigma
Lol How much crack did you smoke to put roadhog last and genji 1st switch there places and we good
You didn’t rank Sigma?
Imo there isn't any meta yet. I've been playing roadhog consistently, i've seen high ranks playing him and he's great
why did they put doom so high, he is the worst character right now, he has the lowest dmg of all tanks, he is also the lest defenceless as he wants to take dmg when using his block but he isn't built to take dmg, the only redeeming feature he has is his mobility but other tanks can be as mobile as him and do more dmg
Where is kiriko
What about sigma
Wot he forgot kiriko
Does he sound nauseous or is it just me
Bro. Doomfist is ass.
Still calling him Jesse Mcree because it's a cool name then whatever his new name is.
gay
This man forgot sigma
Sigma, Kiriko?
funny tier list
you forgot about sigma
Why does zarya get to use bubble after sombra hack? Is that normal?
I was being bored and getting my ass whooped as hanzo so i switched to sombra and immediately won!(too bad i would rather play a more aggressive like junkrat)
I just wanna see the tier list
SIGMA IS THE MAN <3
Lol doomfist at b tier?
Would you change any of these if it was console only? Think certain characters can move up or down depending on mouse/keyboard vs controller
I strongly disagree on Roadhog. hes only bad when playing against a good orisa or a zarya
Im guessing since my guy Sigma wasn’t on the list he’s the best tank in the game
you forgot kiriko :[
U forgot kiriko
besides rating Dva and zarya as S your tank list is pretty wack lol doom rated higher than hog? orissa ult is good, with a nano!? lol no
where is sigma? xd
Zarya is op, sombra is op, doomfist sucks, baptiste op
Orissa is s tier bro
This list is way off
Where’s sigma?
You missed kiriku
Why do deva have two health bars?
My guy what happened to Sigma and Kiriko
Don’t even need to watch the video after reading the comments, let me break it down this way:   Other than a small FEW heroes (I.e. Reaper), if you actually have talent at any aspect of the game you can push to Masters or above. The heroes are balanced, a good widow destroys hog right now for example, Cassidy (McCree) is good enough even with his nerfs to duel most DPS, etc. etc.   Everyone’s list varies so much because everyone is good at different things and hero types. PC vs Console plays a huge role as well, I for one am terrible at automatics like 76, tracer, sojourn on PC, but played solider as a main on Console and was diamond. Way back in season 11 lmao.   Tier lists are kind of useless for this game right now because no hero is OP enough to require such little skill that you can play it and self carry to GM off of it alone.
Doomfist ia definitely d tier
So where is sigma?
Where is Sigma?
I discovered recently that symmetra has the potencial to counter Orisa and Dva, because her ray cannot be stopped by Matrix or the Javelin thing that orisa does to stop shots, if you play with your tank and use your torrets like control points to know if an enemy is coming foe behind can be pretty useful
What happened to sigma
I feel like you are  joking about most of these ranks lol. You do give much explanation of your choices haha
Yeah ypu’re braindead. Doom is easily F tier. Ball is arguably A tier. Just because you’re gm proves how you dont need gamesense now 😂
Bro you forgot Sigma and Orisa B tier? Bruh😂 This is a certified big red shoes and big res nose tier list.
Would be nice for a tier list hero to have an actual tier list not just saying what heroes fit where in the meta. Normally do enjoy your videos.
Did you just forget to rank sigma?
You forgot sigma
This Tank tier List is 🗑. 😂😂😂😂😂
What the hell are y'all smokin?
Putting orisa with doomfist is crazy
is it just me or are sigma and kiriko not on this tier list?      (edit: now I just saw the comment about sigma, didn't see it on the first time cause it was way down beneath all the other comments)
Don't listen to this kid mercy rocks she keeps the team alive 90% of the game lol, can buff, and he probably can't even hit shots with her blaster
doomfist in B and junker queen in D?? wtf am i watching
sigma?
For new players please don’t watch these videos as a guide to what character to pick based off it being A/S tier or whatever. Find a few heroes to play in each role, learn them well and i promise you’ll be good. Any character can be top 500. There’s some that outshine others, sure, but don’t believe that just cause YouTubers say these are “S Tier heroes” that you can’t pull the same numbers with other heroes. You’re better off finding a hero you like and watching videos on how to play it better. Not to mention the “tier lists” changes depending on what rank you’re playing in. If that makes sense.. plus over time they’ll nerf this and buff that so this’ll all change in a few months anyways.
Always love it when people underestimate moira, sure she doesnt bring much when it comes to team utility, but her survivability and insane amount of healing + one of the fastest recharging ultimate is really strong, she does pretty decent damage and her healing from the damage she does is actually huge, i honestly dont know why people rate her so low, maybe in higher ranks its worse, but i took a long break from OW and started to play now in OW2, sure she aint as broken as she was in her release, but her survivability is almost unmatched, youre not going to do much healing as mercy or ana if youre dead  Does she need a rework? Maybe, maybe not a total rework but maybe change the orbs a little bit, i liked the idea blizz had for moiras damage orb rework in beta but that wouldve been really busted
man forgot kiriko and sigma
omg I just found the twitch channel of this godly voice highway! https://www.twitch.tv/highwayw
Am i wrong or did u forget sigma?
What Moira are you guys gettin on your teams where you think her heals and/or dps is bad in any way? I can literally out heal almost any other healer if i focus only on that because I’ve done it before, not to mention her dps is actually pretty good you can rip thru 200s easy.
I feel like ow2 has become a game about pocketing your tanks. Me and one of my friends queued for a ranked game and all i had to do was pocket him while he was playing sigma. He literally could not die.
Funny. Let's say out of 10 Dragonblades I've seen so far, 7 of them got shut down immediately. And as Zen, I've beat a DB one on one
Mercy is dogshit you cant be sayings she's b tier
Moira is easily S Tier for me. She has the most mobility as a healer along with mercy can flank enemy healers and escape super easy while putting on a lot of heal
Since nearly everyone under a certain rank from OW1 got smacked down into bronze, this tier list at low ranks is very inaccurate in some places. I'm just hoping next season, when players are more spread out into their proper ranks, I can get back up to gold at least.
As a healer I really hate when I have to face monkey or ball they are too op and my team just doesnt want to peel and protect me from them. I am currently Diamond 1 I was placed Silver 4 and the diverse from Silver 4 to Diamond 1 is huge. Low ranks play mostly junkerqueen and rein but anything above Diamond 5 starts to be either monkey, dva, hog, ball too but hes questionable because not many people can play him unless u top 500 ball player. Imo monkey is too powerful with brig and ana
11:10 why is it so funny to see the zarya look back confused to why she cant move backwards
Moira is s tier for me I've gotten 16k damage and 9k healing with her in a single game
First time playing Overwatch, always wanted to play the original but never got into it because I’m a console player, my tank mains are Orisa and Rein (honorable mention Roadhog), DPS mains Soldier, Junkrat and Tracer & Support main Zenyatta.
Guys please watch my sombra gameplay  i had so much fun playing it :) first time i played overwatch
Where is sigma?
Am I crazy or did he straight up skip sigma
No sigma?
Where was kiriko? Or is this meant in ranked perspective.
At this point, Blizz just needs to change Winston’s name to monkey lol. No one calls him Winston’s
when u watch a Youtube vid about Roadhog is the best tank in OW2 and in the next vid he is D-Tier ^^ for me he is A-tier for sure
Great "guide". Put Winston above Orisa who's OP ATM. And even completely forgot one of the strongest tanks Sigma
In lower rank where 90% of the player base plays Moria is a goddamn beast.  In an 8 game stretch I went 230-20.  Averaging about 10K healing per match.  We won all 8 games.  The matchmaking is so broken though I only leveled up 1 rank and the game isn’t saving all of my stats.  This launch has to be so embarrassing for Blizzard.
Doomfist is probably the most underpowered character in the game rn.... might need to revise that B tier spot
Mercy higher than moira right now. I swear these "pro" guides are absolute crap. I feel bad for anyone who wants to get better at the game
Winston is really good
I would play this game but when I merge my account it’s now bugged and won’t let me unlock any hero’s for playing so kinda pointless
As a widow main. I also mald when facing a widow.
did you forget a tank
you forgot sigma
Like how sigma is not even mentioned
Does this guy know you’re not supposed to shoot zaryas bubbles?
Where do you think Kiriko will be in the tier list when she's allowed in Ranked?
Sigma not on the list…
You forgot sigma?
What about kiriko?
What happen to bastion
Roadhog D tier……
What do u think about Signa? I didn't see him on the list
Blizzard needs to add another category for game Stats labeled TOA ( time on objective) because there's some idiots that jump in a game and treat it like a death match and completely fuck the match up for the team
Where is sigma?
My first game on Sigma I was holding my own against two other tanks with no support. The reinhardt had to pin me off the map killing himself to kill me.   Bastion I think is super underrated. He has a bit of extra HP making him kind of tanky, his AR is pretty easy to use and his minigun destroys anyone who rushes you while also holding chokepoints and corners, his ult also allows you to attack people out of sight and put pressure on a zone or chokepoint.
idk if im the only one but in my opinion tanks a crazy op in the moment and dps falls behind in damage overall like if the enemy team has one support with brain you cant kill these tanks its insane
Where is sigma
What about sigma!!!!!!???
Hi!
considering the fact the most of us are litarely useless on this game and we see things differently , watching these tier lists made by gms seems to me like proffesional racing drivers making a tier list about family cars. when i see someone saying ana is s tier, im like, man have you ever been in bronze? most anas here in bronze hit 2% of their shots so moira is op at bronze cause she requires almost no skill. Bastion ????? Bastion slays in lower elos, the whole game in general is completely different the lower you go on the ranks.
I have a feeling you made this to have a ton of people who are new follow it so you can farm them. mora low and genji high... To add you said zar as best tank then gave best dps to a class that cant even defend himself from her.
I've yet to see anyone know how to play any of these s tier heroes in unranked. Def a list for good players.
Where is kiriko
Nahhh doom can’t be B I love the guy but I think he desperately needs some work rn
Add timestamps
I didn’t see Sigma in this list? Maybe I missed him, but yeah lol
Where sigma?
Just call him Monkey... lmao  poor Winston... lol
Should switch zarya with orisa because a good orisa is impossible to get past
Sigma…?
Why no Sigma?
you forgot Sigma
If you're new to OW and want to have fun playing the game, please avoid TIERLIST videos.
The fact that he has doomfist in B is crazy. You know the meta is in a decent spot when peoples tier lists vary so much
"Moira dmg is unappealing." Sees her in every single game killing the backline in a few seconds with the mechanical skill of a potato.
Orisa is op idk what your talking about
This tier list is.. bad. You sell coaching services??  you think doomfist is a B tier and mercy is a more useful healer than Moira? This is more a character summary video than a useful tier list in any capacity.
nah reaper gotta be S tier, gang
if someone decides to play brigitte instead of mercy ill be upset just saying
Where was Sigma in the tank review?
What about sigma
Also you completely forgot Kiriko. :|
You completely forgot Sigma. :|
I disagree about Ashe. It's impossible to play as her in the higher ranks against the standard Lucio/Genji/Dva setup.  She is basically useless when the enemy team has a diving type of setup, which happens to be almost all the time.  She might be A tier in the lower ranks but in the higher ranks she is C tier.
Ow2 reaper is a menace
Please stop making these videos. Regardless of how "good or bad" a hero "is"...any high level player would know that literally ANY hero can make it to top 500 or even be rank 1. Tier lists are bullshit.
Where IS Sigma ?
hey, I LOVE your content but as a dup queue Masters Moira main I think it's terrible of you to say Moira is anything less than A. Moira is arguably the strongest support hero in the game.   She arguably has the highest Survivability with her leeching effect and support passive. She's great at dueling squishies as a result. She has mobility that also grants brief invulnerability as well as being able to get her back in the fight quickly after dying. A single tap of heals grants 140 healing which allows her to be able to heal multiple allies quickly at moments notice (contrary to your claim). her ultimate is now stronger than ever with there being 1 less tank she can focus the enemy squishies and guarantee a fight won single handedly.   I could go on.
This list was so ass lmao
Calling doom b tier and ball c tier makes me doubt this list
The variety I'm seeing in these Overwatch 2 tier lists is insane. I don't think I've seen more diverse opinions on character strength for any other game, ever.
orisa is s tier
I disagree with Roadhog being so low. Many times my team has struggled to take him down & he actually carried the team.
So no tanks in A TIer?
No way you put doomfist above rein wtf
Missed kiriko and sigma
It’s funny how low ranks will confidently give you practically the opposite tier list, especially for tanks. Those poor bronze solo queue players with unlucky placement runs must be in actual elo hell rn.
Moira is criminally underrated!
As soon as they make meta to be tankier, genji mains are going to cry. But please don’t bring back shield meta plz
😮where is kiriko?
You know, I think having Coach Mills for this video would've been incredible! A throwback to the old days of GameLeap 🤣
Show the tier list wtf
kiriko is crying right now
No Sigma? 😱
Hey guys! Sigma is S tier! :) Along with Dva and Zarya Here's a picture of all the tiers for each role -- https://i.imgur.com/324AkNB.png
Thanks for the tier list btw! I've always been interested in overwatch but you need PS plus on playstation, so i was hyped when they announced OW2 was f2p. Been having fun getting into the game so far
Sigma bros...
3:47 what is "cc"?
Sigma 404
Do A difficulty tier list  :)
No way u skipped sigma
Why would you skip past the A tier tanks? Literally makes no sense.
would be nice  to have a picture of all the heroes ordered at the end. You also missed Sigma I think ?
I love the videos, one suggestion would be to show the tier list more often. Maybe you talk about a couple heroes in tank, then show the tank tier list. Then move on to a dps tier list. Chopping it up like that can make it easier for people who main one role to see only the heroes they’d select, ranked. Instead of all the clutter from other heroes.   Like I said these videos are great!
sigma?
Great vid b ur wtf Gn I’m still getting my first 50 wins
first
I love you videos man, love you ♥️
