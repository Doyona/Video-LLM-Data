I really like this lad,, such a nice bloke.  I would love to sit down and have a pint with him.  So happy for him
This aged well
Jake said to give him a few years and he'll be ready for Canelo lol. Let that delusion sink in for a minute.
Jakes going to let that right hand fly on tommys chin .andbthe little birdies are going to go coo coo coo coo
Hope fury isn’t over confident lol
I want Tommy to win but he could hardly beat journeymen.
wow Tommys answer at roughly 3mins in shows some maturity I didnt think he had
i really hope this is the guy who finally knocks out that clown
Jake the aggressor wins this fight -- Tommy has poor boxing skills, no power in his punch, hit easily with big right hands - Jake will be super aggressive, all over this guy and rough house him and wear him down -
jake puts on a persona he just cant keep up
Hmm, pretty well spoken by Tommy, I like it, we'll see what happens.
Oh gosh I hope he wins puts jake Paul in his place and hope he doesn’t take a dive like all those other people
I really hope Tommy trains for this and does not underestimate JP
He doesn’t work as hard as Jake thats for sure, so it doesn’t matter how much he says “I’ve been running in the dark with headphones” 😂 cuz that’s nothinggggg compared to Jake’s camp. However, he has been training longer! His whole life, so he doesn’t need to work as hard as Jake. This fight is about experience, power , dedication, pressure, who will come out on top? A lot of factors.
team furry 👍
Technically he’s not got the proper fury bloodline as his mom is not the mom who’s dad was the gypsy champion. Not many people realise this… Tyson’s mom is not tommys mom.
I believe him
Wow.... What an absolute PERFECT ANSWER to the "last name" question.  Tommy says, "I'm not Tyson, never going to be Tyson... I CANT BEAT D. Wilder.... Just wanna be the best version of Myself"  STANDING OVAITION 👏 👏 👏   WELL SAID Brother.  VERY Well said
Tommy Fury’s biggest fight in his boxing career will be against Jake Paul..let that sink in!
BT shills....timmy won't turn up.....again
Tommy flake fury
Jake...Will... W I N.
Fury in the second round with the win
Tommy knows alot about boxing so I trust his intuition.
So chilled is tommy
Why would Jake Buy off a guy with a weak Chin xD
Tommy will flake again or get KO before the end of the 4th. i hope this fight happens, should be a good one but i don't think Tommy will win and will avoid this fight due to the repercussions if he looses. and he most likely will.
Dunno who's the bigger melt him or jake
Not gonna happen :)
I'm sorry but until the fight actually happens, he's names still Tommy fumbles
thats a hell of a statement from him. let's see if he can walk the talk
My man already missed a press conference
I don’t like either but Jake Paul is more hungrier than this man. Tommy Fury has a lot more to lose.
Sound like he's overconfident.that can be dangerous
"I've been training weeks and weeks, months and months" ---okah, so he's been training maybe 2 weeks
Molly Mae Hague is rank
Or
Tommy will not turn up. He’s under too much pressure
My prediction is Tommy wants to retire from boxing to do more TV and this is his way of getting a bag and dipping out 😬 if he loses, that would be his excuse to never box again
I respect 100 percent what he says about his brother and he is right I genualy hope he dismantles jake
I predict Jake going to lose judging by his physique he looks like he intentionally doesn't work out to use this as an excuse of losing
Give Tommy directions  ... He'll probably not show up ... again
Thank u Tommy Jake is a homemade boxer 😂
Hes moved up from his graft in Lancaster lol
Jake's going down sorry fellerz/galz  Comment below and let's come back after I'm right. 😂
I’m not sure it’s ever going to happen but I like Tommy and I hope he sticks with  his confidence and doesn’t get dragged into the circus games of Jake paul. I’m not a Tyson fan but one thing I know is if Tommy loses ,Tyson will have his back
Jake should fight Huey if he thinks he’s tough haha
What would Molly do with a Tiny Shrunken man Jake's to quick for a Giant blond girl let's go JAKE PAUL I'm backing JAKE PAUL !!! February 26th
tommy acts like he didn't pull out multiple times🤣😭
If he can't beat a joke like Jake Paul he should and needs to retire!
No Tommy its not going the distance cuz your either gonna cancel or ctake the loss like a man lol
Who ever seen Tommy look good in a fight……… I’ll wait
Please knock him out
Bru can’t stand Jake. But he’s 10x better than fury. Fury is awful
I wont waste another minute watching any of this bs he will 100% pull out
Tommy should’ve fought him 2 years ago. It’s been 2 years of heavy catch up. Tommy is sleeping on him a bit
Jake paul who?
He would take a trillion let’s be honest
Tommy is either pulling out or getting absolutely embarrassed .
Paul looks a proper div.
He got paid to spar last fight haha
I really want this guy to win.
Jake Paul wants respect, because he doesnt have any, hes followed by incels and idiots who flock to his money. Fury, if he loses he will be a disgrace to all. Jake paul has all to gain, and nothing to lose......I hope Tommy wrecks him. GL tommy.
It's been a orchanstrated plan by the Fury family to get the biggest payday then can. He's been playing loke he didn't want to fight to build Jake ego up. Now, he's coming to beat J.P and embarrass him.
Creed 3
Saying the same thing that he said on the other Jake Paul's going to humiliate him
Tyron Woodley sounded the same
If Jake Paul wins this I’m actual speechless
Lol there both clowns
Biggest fight of his career but he’s not fighting a real boxer? 🤔
Money talks and Jake has money
One can just hope
More bullshit
February 26, 2023 is Tommy Fumble's 'FIRST' fight. Up until the 26th, Tommy Fumble's has been sent into the ring with guys who have been nothing but a punching bag for Tommy Fumbles. They were weaklings that couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag. Now John and Tyson Fumble's are sending Tommy Fumble's into the ring as the punching bag for Jake Paul on the 26th of February. Jake Paul will knock Tommy Fumble's out before the end of the 4th round. Jake is physically and mentally tougher than Tommy Fumble's, and Jake's training sessions are more strenuous than Tommy Fumble's training sessions. Tommy Fumble's will be an embarrassment to the entire Fumble's Family after Jake Paul knocks him 'SPARK' out.
jake paul has smashed ex mma fighters
Tommy will win by points. My prediction
“The End Of An Idiot” 😂😂no truer words have ever been said
Hope Tommy smashes him straight out of the ring. May the best man win.
just as Joe said, whomever thinks that Tommy cant box, its an idiot. HE IS A BOXER!
Jake is in big trouble with this one
I still think Jake Paul will cancel the event just like he did with hasim jr
Jake paul will destroy and conquering once again
I have ignored all of the paul fights because imo the people are taking a dive, everyone who watches boxing knows how some carefully curated boxers career paths are chosen with lesser opponants to keep the win&0 stat. As I am from the UK I know about the travelling community and their pride and I know for a fact there are gonna be no payday dives taken in this fight, so for that reason I AM PUMPED about this fight! I cant feckin wait!
So, I take it mike Perry Will be fighting Jake then
Can’t wait to see Jake Paul’s arrogant face touch the mat
Im sure this fight is going to be canceled for some reason
I hate to say it tommy is gona get knocked out he’s underestimating Jake Jake I’d a fighter he can fight
guys a dosser Fury need to go back to love island they guy chats shi* cant wait to see him loose to jake lol
Hairline looks perfect , is this natural ?
Every time he talks it sounds like he’s memorised it from a script
This fight is not going the distance. Goodnight Tommy
3:09 he's won me over as a fan
Tommy will smoke Jake Paul it’s sad because Jakes story comes to reality
Finally Jake is going to fight a real young boxer!
If Tommy pulls out of the fight. Mission accomplished... fight didn't go the distance 😂🤣
Seriously is his hairline real??
Bell ain’t rung yet, someone can still end up in hospital before then
He doesn’t want to fight Wilder!😂
Why did he take his top off to put his forehead on the other idiots forehead🤔
Lmao this mans fights are boring af
Tommy gonna crush him
Jake is a natural fighter. Tommy isn’t he’s just trying to impress his dad and brother. I feel bad for him I just hope the defeat doesn’t break him…
If this fight actually happens Tommy is wiping the floor with Jake
Hopefully he don’t end up on those “when talking trash goes wrong” videos
Easy win for Tommy, I've said it for the longest now..Jake is good at YouTube level and fighting expired journeymen.   Only one way for this one if Tommy turns up
I don't belive this will hapen
Spoiler   Jake Paul wins
GET HIM TOMMY! RESPECT BRO! GOD BLESS!
Why are people soooo cringy, its next level ego that has and is pushing this world to destruction
Chael Please talk to us about how we can't see Will Flurry for 10 minutes without seeing Tyson fury like he's his security blanket or something. people gotta start talking about Jake Paul as a scary man 🤷🏾‍♂️
Good luck to both men
He is Million times likeable then paul..  Why tommy couldnt win?! Jake paul fought a 47 year old mma champ(probs to silva anyway) he didnt look that good..
Paul has no respect and will be badly hurt.
*I DONT THINK IT HAPPENS*
Fake fixed scam
Jake only fights non-boxers  Tommy is going to lose.
I'm sorry but I think Tommy is going to get smoked. He seems like a pretty boy with muscle and trying to be like his father and brother.
Both of them are over confident and deluded. Will see what happens in the ring
Hoping for a double KO at the same time
The only way tommy looses is if he chokes
Tommy doing a lot of talking. Hope he doesn’t think he won just by actually showing up.
Now Jake’s gonna pull out. Mark me words mate.
Gotta give it to tommy he can trash talk 😅
Wanna put a hundo on fury dropping out
Let hands do talking boys
Smash him for me too please Tommy🤣🤣🤣
This is actually quite an interesting fight because it’s gonna be embarrassing for whoever loses
Word on the boxing grapevines is Round 2 Jake Paul knockout guys, tommy only taking it for a cash out to spend some time with the family
My man Josh making moves 😎 from englands main man to bt's face of boxing well deserved 🥊❤
JAKE IS GOING TO GET KNOCKED OUT!!!
I’ll pay for this fight
If anyone buys this pay-per-view early, they are nuts. I won’t believe this fight is happening until the bell rings.
I like tommy man .
Took u 2 years to grow a pair and fight Jake …to try n get to his level too😂 this guy is a joke
I believe tommy 100%
He just said he’s not going to hold back on Jake so my god he will look silly if he loses but I respect him for doing this because he has a lot to lose
Into him tommy
RIP Jake paul
Tommys had media training surely
Hope he wins
we're complete mugs, lets get our wallets out to see a love island contestant bolster his public brand, fs
This guy can talk better than he boxers haha
Tyson Fury's opponents combined record is around 10-112. Jake is gonna expose him. Believe me.
Tommy ain’t got his big bros skill…Jake will do him in, easy!  English blokes are absolute flogs of the world
Every 1 bet a draw
Man I think Jake going come in with some bullshit he see how hard dude been working and he going come up with a reason to make this fight now happen just like hasmin he see how tuff dude is how hard he working and going flip this fight make sure it do t happen ugh so nervous I beed this fight to happen
Why even try this again? I’m not in the least bit excited…. Tommy fury is a boxer but let’s be real, he isn’t great… how is that interesting?
Does anyone else see how bad jake Paul copied Conor McGregor and still copying Connor it’s a lil wild too see how much a fan he is of Connor
Tommy Teabag going to get floored, stopped and utterly humiliated, unfortunately
The fact that hes talking about training like its something only he is able to do tells me he is deluded i wreckon he is going to get beat. Also my brother fought two guys he fought for charity and put them away quicker than tommy did.just saying.
Goog God I hope this fight happens lol.. I do think Tommy is going to surprise people.. Jake isn't that good lol.. Not saying Tommy is a world beater but I do this he is the best boxer and in the bet shape of anyone Jake has fought.. I think Tommy will grind Jake down and finish him inside 8 rounds.
Aye it is
The days of jogging have been over for decades. Why do ppl damage their joints and limbs performing ng this cardio? There are so many alternative measures like equipment.
2lucky escapes🤣this man
I think Tommy will be to smart for Jake who is easy to hit,however I think it could go the distance
I like Tommy 👍
Tbf tommy seems like a realist
Fake Paul gona make an excuse and blame it on Fury
I seriously hope this is true. I've lumped on  Tommy, the only way he can lose is if he dives. Odds against = buying money
I hope fury can back those words up and knock Logans lights out that would be da best day of my life.
Pan to Tyson chewing his face off 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣❄️
I believe Tommy will do him
He’s a good talker - runs in the family.
Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.
How much does Jake think he is Conor lol!
JAKE PAUL BY SWEET SWEET KO
If he is half as good as his big brother it Will be brutal for Jake Paul
Good luck 🤞
If Tommy loses then we know the fight has been fixed.
A Tyson Fury doesn't come around every 100 years. Its about every 20 years. Lets see. Muhammad Ali George Foreman same ish era. Mike Tyson Evander Hollyfield same ish era Lennox Lewis Vladimir Klitschko Tyson Fury  Definitely not 100 years between those names
The lack of eye contact and looking away when speaking about how much he could be paid to do certain things did not bring me confidence in his truth telling. I never really subscribe to the idea hakes fights were fixed but my man looked away and at the floor both times he said those two things but made eye contact when saying the fight won't go the distance.....m🤔🕵️
so not that confident then...
Smash him Tommy but not in round 1 or 2 let him suffer a bit.
Tommy will embarrass him trust me
Can’t help but feel the smart money goes on a draw…. Neither gets the L, sets up a second fight and maximises revenue. Most bookies have it at 12-14/1
I hope Jake Paul lays this clown out!
Put the house on Jake 💯 tommy takes an L
This fight won’t happen
He's right the fight won't go the distance, Tommy will walk away into the sun with his Mrs and a big bag of money after taking a FALL
Its a fooking drama and another money fight  !! RIP
Will fury is gonna put it on him lolol 😂
As much as I want a "Real Boxer" to teach Jake a boxing lesson I really don't think Tommy is the man to do it?? I've yet to see him and think yeah he's got a future in boxing I think Jake knocks him out?? Either way it's a win win for Jake Paul Tommy can forget about his boxing career if he loses so he definitely has more to lose fair play to him for taking this risk...
I genuinely believe the odds are 55 against  45 to Tommy
Round 2 KO Fury over
I really hope Fury does this man!! we need more English legends and I legit hate jake Paul looool
Hmm he is training so hard against YouTuber hmm interwesting 🤔😂
When is Tommy gonna pull out?
Whenever Tommy talks there’s always this delay like he doesn’t quite believe what he says, I’m gonna say this fight doesn’t happen once again
Please dont break ya other ribs
Please Tommy do everyone a favour and knock this chump out cold jake Paul ain't no boxer or fighter dudes a clown 🤡
I mean Paul is going win. This lad thinks he is like his brother
Please smash him brother much love from Australia
These furys want fame waste  of space idiots follow them ali cassius clay Leonard ther the legends
Disney v Love Island. Close call if Tommy turns up.
Lmfao 🥴🥴😂🤡👎 clown goes down
We’re fully aware boxing’s turned into a circus of a sport recently, since the arrival of these YouTube idiots. For the beautiful art of boxing, and to return it to its best, please Tommy Fury, take Jake Paul out and end this ridiculous era..
That's a lot of confident talk, so I hope he backs it up in the ring. Please win 🙏
Jake is a 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Sorry I respect what Jake's done but I can't see him winning this.
Some of the best answers I've heard in a interview, come on Tommy put joke Paul in his place, had enough of seeing the loser now, get rid
The guy couldn’t even take out Anthony Taylor who is half his size and an MMA guy but thinks it’ll be a walk in the park when it comes to Jake😂 alright buddy his most accomplished fighter is like 10/105 mans lost 105 fights come onnnnnn😆
Jake Paul will win, don't be fooled by the YouTube stuff. Jake can fight
not taking a trillion pounds to take a dive and be the richest person who has ever lived and can change billions of peoples lives is just bad personal finance lol
HHHHAAAA what clap he has only fought bums and talks he so good hhhhaa will look a right prat if he loses,but a rich one
Jake knocks him spark out
Ok we all want Tommy to win to shut Jake up BUT......... if Tommy loses somehow. Jesus 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️😂.
Great interview 👍
Yes Tommy ... do us all a favour and beat this bell end.
Tommy looks like a swole pretty boy with a lot on his shoulders…. Sad
I feel like this fight is gonna come down to punchers chance. Yes that’s boxing, but it’s hard to make it obvious, it’ll likely be whoever lands the big shot.
Ur gunna get rocked tummy 😂
We'll see if this fight even happens
Tommy’s a fool jake will expose him
Jake wins .
Never be so confident of your win over a guy who knocked out and knocked down even 50 years old MMA fighters,  believe me that means something , let me tell ja , Jake gets better still not pro boxer like Benavides brothers but Tommy it's kind of boring boxer obviously with a lot of talent but not using his body , I think Mike Tyson moves to increase the speed and power or the punched can serve him very well but In the end its all about his family to make him to prepare to do what he said gonna do to blonde head ...
Remind me if the wine aged well or not after the fight thanks
Please knock Jake Paul into another dimention. Show these fools that there is a difference between a real boxer and a YouTuber who rigs fights or takes on old ex MAA fighters.
Tommy Fury gonna get his bell rung I can't believe he finally got the balls to fight Jake.
Tommy is a joke. As a person, not as a boxer. As good as Jake as a boxer.
It's all talk til we see the press conference
I'm gonna be soooo mad if this doesn't happen... even more mad if Tommy doesn't show up and put him out... time will tell tho
He could not even beat Anthony Taylor
Jake Paul should be embarrassed if he loses! I read that Tommy's past opponent's have a combined record of 12-174 😂
Someone pulling out
Tommy must be the mailman baby
I pray for Tommy  to destroy him
First around I think for tommy
He better get it done
The bums that Tommy Fury has fought
Talk is cheap I'll believe it's happening when there punching each other
Please  this dude has had only 8 fights with taxi drivers as boxers,  he said he's been doing this for years yet, Paul has  fought more dangerous opponents in his short  correir.
I don't even like Jake but I think he will KO this model wannabe boxer
3rd round ko to fury 🎉
This will probably not happen if jake doesnt get his way he will definitely pullout of the fight with excuses guaranteed
💤💤💤💤💤💩
Get slept
Imagine … if Paul gets KO’d by a guy who’s 8-0 and fought NOBODY at all… the people that actually paid for all his PPVs and thought he was the real thing 😂😂😂
He sounds like the blue muscular dude from the Hxh Hunter exam arc💀
“He Bounces around Like Hes Canelo” 😂😂😂😂
Tommy is going to do this for actual boxing! Time to finish these YouTubers ruining this great sport once and for all!
What joke I'll put our local pub fighter againsts these pretty boys because they really can't fight
Trash talk dont matter, Bottom line is we will see who wins
What's the bet is a fixed draw....
I'm quite excited about this it's a good hype for such a rubbish fight lol
I can’t go there and beat deontay wilder lol😂 true tho
Good man.
a part of me hopes this video ages well😂
I believe people are under estimating  Jake.  I'll go with Jake on this one.  I see all heart with jake...passion.  I believe Tommy doesn't believe what he is saying.  Sounds like tough talk, but I believe it's fake.  We will see soon ....OR will Tommy drop out, lol
imagine thinking this fight is going to happen, then what if JP beats TF lol
Cap
Triplelindy
Break a fooocin rib!!!!!
Tommy got this in the bag
He'll be paid to make it go the distance.
I hope Fury knocks Paul out in the 1st round, then tbags him while he's unconscious.  Then upon the moment where most fighters give a respective handshake/hug/some combination of the above, he knocks him out again like the clown Paul is.
listen when he says im te boxer not a fake fighter or a 50 year old or ufc hes a boxer so when jake cracks him yall cant stay dik dik any more enjoy this is the start
So many things happening at the end of the day...
Hope Tommy stops him early 🇬🇧
TOMMY DIDNT TURN UP TO THE FACE 2 FACE INTERVIEW. HE’S SCARED OF JAKE. UNPROFESSIONAL
The YouTuber with bash fury up as he can’t fight.one of the very worst Boxers the worlds ever seen 🤣🤣🤣
I once saw video of Tyson telling Tommy to go home and not to join a party.....Tommy was arguing to come....and that's what I need to know.....Jake Paul knows....
If it happens please for the love of god knock Jake Paul out he needs to be humbled
I want Tommy to win but he won’t.
Tommy makes a very grounded impression, wish him all the best… hope the fight will happen and he’s gonna put Jake Paul in his place
He’s not too bright
God, I hope this fight is gonna happen this time.
It’s all bogus
Nowhere left to hide, for Timmy Fumbles!
Sure thing Tommy. Same thing all the other cash cows said before they fought him.
I hope Tommy wins and dosent take the payout from jake Paul for me I think people have bin taking a dive for the money 💰
If every fighter was right in what they said then not a single fight in the history of fighting would've ever 'gone the distance'.
Jake Paul  has no idea how to box
i hope he beats jp and makes his own name a stand in the sport, he can
Won't happen, something will go wrong, or Paul will knock him out, I hope not but it's my luck, I hope Tommy annihilates him
Tommy’s gonna get done right in
Is this man related to Tyson Fury?
I like his confidence, I think he will beat Jake in the later rounds
Indeed
100% will be a draw and then another year+ until a rematch. We've seen it all before, this is just childs entertainment at this point.
I’m excited to see this fight!
I really hope that he doesn’t get bribed
Rock on Tommy!
Ya gonna get banged clean out by a youtuber mate 😆😆😆😆😆
Tommy the bell end fury he's going to be disowned wen he fails to win 🤣 can't wait to watch it he's not an elite boxer he hasn't even fought anyone of any quality. The people he's boxed won 0 fights and had 0 knockouts apart from 1 fight he's a hype job. Least jake Paul fought worthy fighters who could throw punches 👊.
Jake Paul has far more knockout power with his overhand right, though Tommy is slightly more skilled in defence. Both aren’t proper boxers yet they’ve had warm up fights against bums or old men has beens
Would not fight for a trillion, but this fight is purely business ? anyway hope he wins otherwise this video will haunt him.
Not go the distance because it probably won't happen
End this clown plz
My opinion is that Tommy is going to destroy Paul. Maybe im wrong but I’m not sure I can discount the fact that he has trained boxing his whole life in that family. Can’t see him losing
Blimey Jake Paul actually fighting a boxer. Who's have thunk it? If it happens of course!! 🤔🤔
Its crazy that a youtube guy and a 2nd rate boxer is going to be pay-per-view  Just let that sink it, its actually mental and the tv companies are ripping the piss out of the public but unfortunately people will buy it 🤷‍♂️
All this commotion over a rigged fight Jesus everyone get a grip 🤦🏾‍♂️
Tommy will smoke Jake if it happens
I have no idea who is going to win this fight, gonna be a good one! Hopefully Jake wins, so KSI can't make up more excuses to not fight him, cause KSI vs Jake Paul needs to happen.
Seeing TNTs style and his boxing skillset... I don't think TNT has a chance of winning. I think he will get smoked by Paul within 4 rounds. Big big upset for Tommy. I think it's the wrong time for him to fight especially having a new born. Congratulations on fatherhood Tommy.
14 fights between them, and all against journeymen or guys that are not even boxers. And it's still on PPV. 😂🤣
I actually want Jake Paul to hammer Fury.
Who tf is Jake Paul???
Jake Paul thinks he’s gonna win 😂
Wishing Tommy all the best as a sportsman and congratulating him and Molly-Mae  on the birth of their daughter to which  JP  contacts them with “Just in time to watch your dad get knocked out.”  Tommy  a great interview and thanks for BT Sport Boxing sharing. Some people are breed from stock  and its in Tommys hands litteraly
too long to wait !
Tommy is a boxer other people the paul clown as fights with is mma fighter and Youtubers
Paul needs to get dropped ASAP!
Jake is in his head 100%.
Turn up Tommy. Talk too much.
Jake Paul will pull out
Sad to say this. But i think Jake Paul will win.
So two people who live in the shadow of their brothers
I personally believe Tommy will take a dive for that final large pay day, it's all about money & no pride nowadays.
Have to say - Tommy really does speak well, for himself. Analogies on point. Humor isn’t gratuitous. Good for him.
Tommy fury is the only guy frightened to get wet in the shower , cant stand Jake Paul but hes gona chin part time fury.
Paul beat Silva who beat Chavez-a real, professional boxer. Fury is a slow plodding fighter who gets hit..Paul actually has real knockout power.
Breaking news: even though they were just in a ring together, tommy fury is unable to make the fight due to having flight cancelled in...uh Jamaica.  Rumor has it Jake Paul decides to fight 78 year old man who hit a microwave once for not working. 🔥🔥🔥
No doubt the coward will pull out again due to get another weak as a kitten excuse.
Love or hate Tommy, surely we're all together in hoping he knocks Jake out🤕
Give me a trillion pound and I’ll dive all over the place 🤣
so for the first time J. Paul is taking on the real opponent - pro boxer, in his age, not 50 y old retired geezer:), so yes, Tommy will sort him out in pro manner, and it will humble Paul down
He's a young lad and 45 year old, fat builders are slagging him on instagram getting their little dopamine rush, slating him when he's just trying to find his way in life.  Either way, fair play to them both now, Fury should win, but won't be upset either way.
This is a mistake for Fury. When he loses it’ll be the end of his career
It isnt going the distance Jakes going to knock him out!
Trillion it don’t happen
Wish I was rich
I hope he does beat Paul.
I’m a huge boxing fan, & it kills me to say this, but if I’m been honest, Jake Paul punches harder then fury.
Who cares
Is it just me that thinks Tommy Fury body looks very miss shaped 😕  a wonder what he's been on in the past 🤣
I feel Jake might surprise everyone! Tommy been ducking this for 2 years 😅😴
Fascinating how we can be hoodwinked into  paying £20 to watch 2 average boxers by hype and social media followers
jake paul has made a mistake not fighting some real boxers before taking this fight and i see it ending in a win for fury
i think his going to get knocked out and his not gunna recover
Major props to whoever they’ve hired for editing 👏
If he doesn't back up his words he's gonna go down as boxing biggest clown
I expect Tommy to school Jake. I train boxing with pros and ams and Jake does not have the fundamentals down.. there's proper armature boxers out there with far more experience some have over 80 fights in the ams that could flog Jake easy.
I absolutely fken hate Jake but I see Jake knocking this fool out by the 6th.
Hope Tommy nocks the yanks head off ..come on Tommy..
No one cares!!!  Tommy is a nobody who has done absolutely nothing in boxing to earn this pay check on a ppv fighting a nobody 🤷‍♂️ he really loves the lime light. 🙈 Joke of a fight. Total disrespect to pros. Especially those who get paid naff all and are on 10+ wins.  🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑
Come on Tommy. Please knock him out. This show needs to end. Knock him out so he can fight KSI and then lose that fight as well.
Funny that Tommy says Jake's a rubbish boxer, but his brother Tyson says he's a decent boxer 🤔
Paul fury sounds like a nice lad.
This guy really believes what he is saying, still doesn’t guarantee a win however it’s the right way to go about it.💯
Timmy will get paid well, no USADA he can take as many roids as he wants and still won’t win imo
Got a feeling Jake Paul gunna ko tommy
Did he say “Chris must come early for me”????
Two soft boys
Jake will punch him up then take his girl from him
humble this kunt tommy
somehow i think tommy gonna lose by ko
I’ll do anything for a tril
the crazy thing is that scientifically i know tommy can beat him but the primary focus of the fight actually happening has been off
Paul's record should only show professional boxers he has faced.....so 0
its important for tommy fury to be told that jake paul is a serious fighter because if he did not get told  that it would be round 7 or 8 and it would be harder then tommy expected and he might get dropped round 7 or 8
tommy got his last fight against jake paul
LETS GO TOMMY BOY.
Go on Tommy knock this doughnut out 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
Timmy fury is the worst boxer 🤣he’s only boxing because his dad and brother box 🤣
Until they are in the ring I don’t believe it’s happening
No lie Jake Paul smart for first getting experience before fighting Tom
If this is tommy then which is W2S
The way Tomy is talking about Jake Paul reminds me of when  Ben Asscream was talking about destroying Jake.
I want to see at first fight they draw. Second fight They Draw again. Then one of them won.
This cat ain’t winning. Boxing has become a showboat of a business. Y’all probably had no idea this dude existed if it wasn’t for Jake Paul. Boxing is a reality show now.
If the fight will happen brother make him suffer...
Tommy is saying the same generic things over and over whenever hes on the mic.🥴
Calling it now..a boring fight that will 100% go the distance
Still talking about 'taking a fall' mad disrespectful to your opponent, their fam better take man serious, he's got real KO's vs amateur's, Tommy don't. If after all this time and ducked fights he still can't respect what the mans doing, and still calls it 'taking a fall' that's surface level disrespect but a sign of hidden fear 🤣
Pretty boys last fight
Jake def have balls to step up with a 3rd gen fury! I knew his place, he def wanna loose with a Rd gen gypsy fury, all he has is 1 hook, man Jake is the man!!
He should fight Wilders little brother
Tommy be running 😒
put jake in the ICU.
He pulled out before yeah “tommy”
This fight is 50/50  50% Tommy bails again. 50% Tommy gets KO’d
Tommy Fumbles is going to sleep
Tyson broke your rib on purpose, trouble being tommy is not smart enough to see that he is going to get out classed!
All talk then in fight night Fury will run again and  again and again
Be funny if jake ko Tommy 😄
Who runs without headphones?! 😮🤯
He's such a likeable bloke. Seems like a top lad to go for a pint with. I wish him nothing but the best. I hope he makes bank and enjoys himself.
it will go the distance
Tommy looks worried and sounds like he's trying to convince himself.
He won’t fight Jake Paul, he will make some excuse 😂
Paul has fallen for the same thing as Wilder: It's called the Confidence Trick, patented by big John
100% will be a Draw
Tommy gonna duck again.
Just focus on your defense
Despite all this hype they will just spar with each other And possibly end in a draw.
The scene where they just randomly cut to Jake screaming got me 😂😂😂
Trillion Pounds? Be real your diving for that type of money
"If Tommy loses I'm leaving him in Saudi Arabia, he can become a PT for Ronaldo" - Tyson Fury.
The whole thing is a circus I see better fights in the pub and someone is taking a dive the whole thing is corrupt its about money and nothing else
Tyson comes around ever hundred years. Far fetched.
Lol..Fury is getting taxed.
Respect to Tommy for acknowledging Canelo as the king of boxing.
Na,Tommy knows if he gets beat in this fight his career is over,it's that simple,can't see this happening
jake paul will win
Tommy is getting paid to take the dive
Jake already gave the down payment
Not convinced
pretty boy Tommy, Jake Paul is gonna destroy your punchable face! 🥊 🥊
This fight will not happen
i like this dude, don’t understand the hate he gets. very humble and mature especially for a 23 year old in his position
Tommy the silver spoon jiipo
Oh Tommy! There is more hope than I thought. I hope he sticks to game plan and is actually HUNGRY. If he can keep his calm and do what he does… He should be fine.
Tommys not knocking anyone out!! Give over!! 😂 Tommys banter is horrific !!  I don’t even believe that Tommy deserves to fight Paul especially for 2.5m ! “I run without headphones!” Haha who cares! This guy is a sausage !
I’m actually rooting for tommy this time
He sounds just like his brother it's crazy
Beat jake and ur my guy
I saw fear in Jake's eyes when his interview was interrupted by Tyson.  The mask slipped on his little act for a second or two.
Paul’s fan base is growing. But I still hope Fury shatters that glass jaw
Not too long for Tommy to run away either
So Fury has been ducking Jake for two and a half years, this ain't a boxer lol ??
Tommy looks like a model not a fighter
Tommy is a trash boxer but so is Jake Paul....im picking Jake Paul to win only because hes the better promoter
Tommy... your not walking out of the ring with your head attached lol  R.I.P.
I think Jake will KO this journey man
Tommy mark my words fury
"He does not know how to fight"...as they show him absolutely killing Woodley and Silva.
Yawn. Stfu and get in the ring already. Been building this up for like 3 years or something. And not paying for this sh*t either I’ll watch the free highlights on YouTube after 😂
I hope this  is a big KO I so want Jake Paul out flat on the canvas. 🙏🏻🥊
😂😂😂 CLOWN😂😂🤦🏼‍♀️ SAID ALL THIS BEFORE🤦🏼‍♀️ WONDER WHAT EXCUSE TOMMY GONA GIVE THIS TIME HE'S BRINGING PURE SHAME TO THE LEGACY TYSON HAS BUILT ON THE FURY NAME!!!
Good to see Tommy helping out with the promotions. Only helps the fight.
His career is over if he losses. I don’t like that jake. Bell endz that family. Good luck if it happens Tommy
Scariest thing about Tommy Fury is his Mike Wazowski frame. I fear that Paul will actually get him done, and I hate that I'm saying that.
How many days before he pulls out? 4 days before the fight
still don't believe this fight will happen until they are both in the ring
Jake is gonna knock him the spark out!! Lol
He said its gonna be the end of a idot lol
Gotta say Jake is going to beat this  C Grade level boxer😂
Steroids verse Steroids, should be amazing, smh.
Can't help but to love this dude...real talk
Why do i have a feeling that Jake pol will win again 🗿
Tommy is a beast, respect from America.
Either way I think both dudes are at a crossroad and the fork in the road ends with this fight so pumped for this LETS GO BOYS!!!
Do it Tommy..Do it Tommy..Knock Him ....All the way From New Zealand
THe B roll footage is hilarious LMFAO
Bro's training to become Bryce hall.. "I'm a boxer I'm legend. He's not going to win blah blah"
Somebody Clip this
Lol Tommy struggled against Anthony Taylor who Jake' destroyed in sparring years  ago..... Tommy wake up bubba your gonna be stuck in Saudi Arabia lol
steroids vs steroids i will watch
Tommy shud have stuck to Modeling..
Can't wait for Jake to knock him Out
“Get back to boxing real fighters” 😂😂😂
Anderson Silva would beat Fury so he better come prepared...
He’s going to make a joke of jake……..it’s going to be so funny….I can’t wait
Lmao trillion pounds? Didn't he make out with a guy on a reality show just to be famous?
Fury going to lose and look stupid.
I still don’t feel like this is gunna happen.
Even if this fight is jinxed and it doesn't happen, I'm still excited about Mike Perry as a backup. That could be a banger
If a Youtuber beats a Fury it would be hilarious. 🤣  Don't get me wrong, Paul is annoying & Tommy seems cool, but it would be funny if Paul won.
Yo Tommy, nobody believes a word that comes out of your mouth
It will be easy for Tommy to hit Jakes big head.
Na it's gonna happen this time.
Jake via K.O
What's y'all predictions?
was that interviewer on love island
What if Tommy loses 😂😂
This fight is for sure going the distance
The viewership numbers is looking good on the match up. 250k in 10 hours, the interest is absolutely there  This is truly what we're all about - 2 guys, in their prime, having a beef and each with a separate audience invested in their success  Let's go, Feb 26th - couldn't get here any sooner
Has anyone deeped that they were both on love island
At this point it doesn’t matter if jake knocks him out first round. He’ll never get his flowers or credit.
I doubt the fight actually happens.
I wanna see Tommy win, he definitely has what it takes to beat Jake but I think Jake has what it takes to beat Tommy aswell it’s a tough call
Tommy gonna expose Jake Paul.  Tommy got the best adviser on his side, his brother Tyson, the best tactician of this era, I know Tyson watched some of Jake's fight and pretty sure he saw a lot of things they could take advantage of.
How bout you’s just fight!
Its all fun and games until the lights go on and the whole world is watching. Jake has more experience in that category.  Tommy has to stay present.
I hate to say it but this is easy win for Jake
I think it’s safe to say we see Jake v Mike Perry
Ofc it’s not going the distance. It’s a 10 round fight. He’s only ever done 4 rounds and one 6 round 😂
If Jake loses o don’t think he’ll stop, he might go into MMA which is harder than boxing, I’ve done the 2 as well as mauy thai. I think he’ll keep going full force
I just want the fight to happen now!!!
He’s been paid to take a dive. Just like all the previous opponents.
Pretends like he’s not the one duckin 😂😂
I actually have faith in tommy he has more stamina and power
Jake is about to lose .  People underestimate this man just bc they don’t like him.  I can’t wait
Hes gonna get KOd by Jake Paul and then everyone is gonna say see he fought a real boxer lol he aint no damn boxer hes probly ranked 200th in the world at his weight class
Tommy defo pulling out
Tyson fury from the walmart
Ngl I think Jake wins
Surely Fury knocks this guy out. 3 years experience fighting non boxers speaks for itself.
Tommy just sold this fight for me
Think it might be bought already, I think if Fury Loses. There’s no way he’s not paying fighters
I can't wait to see Jake Paul getting off the f*** out
I'm praying the loud mouth yank, gets put into a coma.
Fury should beat Paul in a round 1
someone who wouldn't take a trillion to lose is a LIAR!
my hopes won't be up till they enter the ring. but im still team fury
Let’s go tommy furry all glory to Jesus 🥊❤️✝️👑
Logan kos him bet... I mean Jake.... eh it don't matter its rigged "wwe" boxing
My $son Tommy
if tommy doesnt beat him hes wasted his life in boxing lmao
I can’t actually believe people think Jake Paul beats Tommy fury.  Don’t get me wrong, fury has a lot to prove in the boxing game but it’s a simple as 1,2,3 that Tommy Fury beats Paul.
Ill bet all my money Jake Paul will win. He's the undefeated boxer of all time and way better than Mike Tyson.
After saying all this if he doesn’t back it up he’s going to be a joke
Tommy couldn't drop a former 135 lbs MMA fighter in his last fight.
He has one of the cleanest hairline lol no homo
LONG LIVE the travlers!! GYPSY BLOOD !!! Don't let us down lad x  Orstay in Saudi;) xx
Go on tommy !! I. From the Lee family born and bread 🍞!! do this for OUR country !! Love ❤️
I can see Tommy pulling out again and platinum Perry steps in
I can’t see Tommy winning; I don’t like Jake much, but I think he would win this.
I severely dislike the Paul Brothers, but I'm curious to see if Tommy can box how they need him to in order to stay standing and land his own shots.  Legacy on the line, Tommy really isnt hat good, it's a great match up, but I think Jake survives, not sure about Tommy's Reputation. HOLY HELL I HOPE I'M WRONG
Ben Simmons is a great interviewer
Tommy’s already won this. At the end of the day it comes down to skill and conditioning, and Jake has none 😂
I'm a Manc. Would love Tommy to win, guy is the type to check himself out in a window on the way past. He's gonna get slogged
Jake Paul is a genius when it comes picking fights. He fought few famous old non-boxers. And, now he is going to fight a wannabe boxer with a Fury last name. He is going to win this in a land slide.
I really hope Tommy wins
Straight up, he beats jake…it’s simple
🥱
Jake Paul is going to get knocked out. Bunch of 🥩 🚴 actually think Jake Paul can fight lmfaoooo.
Who cares. He is not a boxer, jerk paul is on amateur level with nearly no defence.
This could propel Tommy Fury's boxing career if he wins
I see Tommy winning this by points until the last round, and Jake stops him at the last moment
Jake Paul takes it
miles and miles so he can run away
Tommy was superb in Love Island, Jake Paul would leave the villa after one week, coz he likes boys.
I can beat Tyson even if he’s 50 lmao
I bet my life on it.   bet the money your going to win publicly LIKE A BOSS.  legit put your money where your mouth is! DOUBLE THAT STACK HOMIE LOL
even if this fight happens Jake will still have not fought a Real boxer...Tommy Fury is NOT a real boxer imo.
I love that Tommy respects Canelo Alvarez!
Two love island stars talking about a youtuber, for the worse or better boxing has defo changed a little lol
4 weeks away from this fight not happening
Go on Tommy.... Jake gonna get hurt....bad...
Tommy will smash this joker once and for all
He cannot say all of this and lose! Pls
jake paul win KO round 5
I truly believe this fight is gonna be a fight that is hyped but the bell goes they go at least 2 rounds I believe jake stuns Tommy with a clean right hand and completely shocks the world similar to Ksi faze temper because it only takes one punch by the time it’s landed ref will wave it off and we all gonna be disappointed not because of the outcome because of how long it lasted. 😂😂😂
The fight may not go the distance but the Hype will.🤣🤣🤣
Did he mean to say this fight is absolutely no chance of happening. .?
DC Danny Christie is going to do some sparring  with Tommy would like to see some footage of that. If Tommy looses witch i think he wont, DC should fight Jake he'd smash Jake 100% no ifs ands or buts about it.
Tommy pulls out
Go the distance?! We all know T his fight won’t make it to the ring! Do not pre-purchase PPV until the day of, an hour before if even that, or wait till both fighters are in the ring, then stream.
Tommy is kinda built like he has fake muscles
Tysons jaw swinging 😂
I am rooting for jake
Tommy Fury has got really long monkey arms, he can literally scratch his toes while standing up. I don't know why but I can see Tommy getting KO'd. Tommy can't knock out anyone he fought, so he got no chance of knocking Jake Paul out
Let's finaly settle this people are interested
He gona flop
He talks with a lot of scary confidence. I hope Jake trains well
Thats the truth right there. Everything he said is correct. The right attitude. Hes done it all his life aint no way some youtuber gonna beat him
Jakes gonna smesh your boy
He never ever says anything insightful about boxing, he just repeats the same old rubbish and is stuck trying to emulate his half brother Tyson. His opponents have been humiliatingly awful. Six years a pro and this is the biggest fight of his life.
Oh Jake is going to get a beating!
He mite pull out fight but he couldn’t pull out of molly
I think it’s gunna be 6 rounds and Tyson gunna be laughing his head off 😂
I do hope and pray Tommy makes a fool out of Jake Paul because it would make us all so happy and entertained 😊😂 and frankly he deserves it.
If fury doesnt pull out again this fight will make him way more popular wether he wins or not. Hes not famous now for his boxing hes famous because of his brothers boxing. This could open some doors for him not to mention the most hes ever made for a fight
"every fight is the same" shows clips of his opponents getting sparked LMAO, is Tommy sure he wants every fight to be the same?
He better NOT embarrass himself and lose to that silly Chinny ginger balding utube star…
I hope tommy fury destroys that fool
3.02 the way he says there’s no pressure on me..
Tommy Fury in addition to work on your technique and fight plan work on your one punch knockout power, good luck!
I actually think the odds are in Jake's favor for this fight.  I haven't seen anything special from Tommy Fury TBH, Jake Paul has serious power in his right hand.  This should be interesting though.
This guy is more delusional than Dillon Danis
What is josh denzel interviewing boxers he has 0 relevance to the sport, stick to reality tv. Boxing is becoming a joke
big words from Tommy, the way he talked it would be embarrassing if he loses in the end. Jake is not stupid and his team isnt either, they sure have a plan why they picked tommy. Likely scenario I can think of is, that the fight goes the distance, Jake gets a "controversial" win which opens the possibility for more drama and a rematch.
Ima be honest I like a lot of the stuff tommy said especially about his brother he’s not he’s brother he’s brothers something that only comes around every other thirty years ..but that don’t mean he can’t be great
Anyone else read that as “Tommy fury excuses” and not “exclusive”🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
clowns.. looking for clout!!
Tommy is all talk. He is getting chinned by Jake.
Not a jake paul fan by any means and actually look forward to seein him get ko'd but i really dont think this is the guy to do it, actually the opposite id say tommys gettin highlighted on jakes best of,,,
I think tommy will win
Jake is a big boy Tommy better respect that
I think neither of them have any decent experience!! Tommy comes with the Fury name whatever he says and Jake Paul is flat footed who telegraph's his punches! I'm picking Tommy to win but it'll be close.
6:42 came out of nowhere lol
Make sure u put it on Him now Tommy..No Doubt 😤
Tommy can easily win this fight if he gets to take advantage everytime Jake crosses his feet
if this fight ever goes ahead & thats a big "if" ile put my money on the result being a draw , that way its another chance to scam the blind public into parting with even more money in the name of a boxing match
He said he's going into that fight with no emotion about jake then he says he's jogging every morning with no headphones just thinking about jake. Ffs make it make sense Tom🫁y
Two average fighters going at it
Bit suspect that he mentions how he wouldn't take a trillion pound for this or that when the interviewer never asked if he would take any more for anything :/
I’ll b surprised if this fight actually happens. Some bs always comes up
Bookies are giving  odds of 11/8 for fury to win, bet this now as he will most likely go off as the favourite, he is gonna destroy jake paul,
I bet on this guy. No disrespect to jake tho
I’m going to meet Tommy Fury one day whenever I travel places in other states he is a real professional boxer who can’t take out Jake Paul and defeat him in 8 rounds straight by TKO Jake I will never watch this clown showbiz  performer because he ain’t made for boxing Jake doesn’t belong in the sport I love Tommy Fury he is a legend in the making of winning world heavyweight titles and he will.
Knocked out by jake Paul in the third round . Sorry ain't got it afraid of a war , great orator like his brother , but he's the best of his era .
Jake Paul win nobody will shut his mouth in years . 🥲 Have not change against a real boxer but lucky punch exist. But Tommy will destroy him.
Tommy gonna knock him out
It's got to be a side bet with Tyson and Jake and this going I hope like a couple of million
The pullout merchant himself
my nephew boxed one of tommy fury’s ex opponents and he smashed him but pretty boy fury struggled what a fk clown
The STATES are supporting Fury, beat his a**
Tommy spar Joseph parker for this fight. That would be someone who hits harder than Jake and has better boxing ability plus isn't really that good either plus he likes to fight from the outside
Pair of steroid mugs
Legend says Tommy never gets any woman other than his wife pregnant because his pull out game is top notch.
This is not boxing. Real box died long time ago.
Josh's Travis Scott's though 👌👌👌
These lads and the circus around them aren't stupid. No matter how the fight goes there'll be the return fight which may become some crappy trilogy. These guys stand to make a lot of money.
He sounds like kambosos  lol I've been training  art of war put miles in.  He still gonna lose to Jake. One way in the world he gonna lose rip Tommy.
Jake Paul 8th round
Tommy fury will knock Jake out
Tommy Fury "I don't need to train to beat, Jake". Also, Tommy "I've been training for weeks and weeks".
It's not love island why I write Tommy's world titles hope's off, it's the multiple right hands from journeymen I've seen him take
This guy is weak. He’s going down hard.
I don't care anymore
People actually think Jake beats Tommy on points 😂 Only way he wins is by knockout
Crazy Tommy’s toughest test to date is a YouTuber with a passion project
Still plenty of time yet for this to fall through 😂
Sad thing is. I honestly reckon these 2 are going to really put a show on. Call it gut feeling but both will gain respect after this.
At this point I'm just rooting for Jake Paul to Ko this guy.
Looking forward to this fight. 2 and half of making... Mark our colanders on 26 Feb 2023 on BTsport
If Tommy doesn’t batter jake I’ll be very surpised
I hope tommy will win but idk.. let's go tommy!!
Jake has trained for tommy twice. Tommy is screwed
Jake KOs Tommy round 1 in first 1:30
just imagine the memes if he looses
First time I’ve really spent any time listening to him and I’m really it’s surprised me 👍🏻boxing aside what a great guy never judge a book by its cover they say
Two total posers obs I ain’t payin to watch this farce WTF is going on with boxing, total joke and piss take someone needs to stop this comedy it’s all hyped up to sell tickets and and knob that pays is a DIV!
im really hoping Tommy teaches this this guy a lesson and knocks him out tommy seems such a nice guy just like his  brother.
Fury has the most odd physique ive ever seen
Imagine if Tommy loses this fight though? Sure he'll make some money but he'll be a joke the rest of his life. He will never live it down. Tyson and the rest of the gypsy family would be ashamed of him. I don't mind Tommy but I really don't like Jake, so I hope he knocks him out.
Tommy's got it all to loose that's why he may loose... if Jakes looses it changes nothing for jake. So James doesn't have the fear of loosing everything  or it could be for all of those things Tommy fights for and that fear drives him to destroy jake.. I hope he absolutely batters every bit of ego out of that jake Paul so he never wants to fight again
I think he's going to do it and then floor ksi
I don't take this sport seriously anymore.  Any celeb can join.
I got jake
or this guy is really dumb or is making bluff
Be scared Jake. He's training with NO HEADPHONES!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This dude is such a clown. Hopefully he shows up
This man should have taken the more humble route cause now all jokes aside if this man loses... oh lord he will have to retire after these words lol or at least get I got beaten by Jake Paul tattooed on his chest
Tommy, only hist last name shines. Tommy Fury is an untested mediocre boxer. He only fought journeymans, he couldn't even ko a fighter like Jevgenijs Andrejevs (10–102–3) . Honestly, the only person going to be humbled is Tommy Fury.
Wait this man just blame jake for them not fighting then the 3 reason we’re all in him😂😂😂
Tommy is deluded. He's gonna get battered by a YouTube gimp.  More of a disgrace to the fury name than his dad is 🤷‍♂️
I cannot wait for this fight. Brilliant.
Good pay day for Tommy nice one
Two love islanders in conversation 😂! Big up them man !
Tommy fumbles is gonna pull out!
I’m sorry I just can’t take anybody that talks like an action figure seriously 😂. Does he have a string in his back? Is there a button somewhere?!
timmy willl get a tummy ache  again
It’s crazy that Tommy is a “real boxer” and it would still be embarrassing for Jake to lose to him
Jake wins
Hopefully they’ll both lose and then they can both just disappear again. Pair of chancers.
Tommy’s being honest about the very first part he wouldn’t take trillion pounds because his family would disown him if he loses(which I hope he has his bags packed.) and it isn’t going the distance he’s gonna get knocked TF out in 1st.
It’s gonna be funny if they actually fight and goofy jake Paul kos him.fury has way more to lose.
The one thing I'd say is spar less technical boxers because Jake Paul isn't gonna fight like that
long row of fighting men my grandad could juggle don't mean I can, his brother beat wilder n thinks his Ali, surely he can beat Jake though his been doing it since 12..
How has boxing allowed these clowns 🤡 to take over???
I think these guys might knock each other down in this fight.
Tommy is actually pretty decent He has a freakishly long reach as well
I'd love to have a huge payday fighting someone as bad as Jake Paul Jesus life's good
The fights not happening
I can’t see Tommy losing this one, it doesn’t seem like the pressure is getting to him, but if I was him, damn, having Tyson in the family would put huge pressure on me…
I just feel Jake is gonna get cracked with a real shot from a boxer and he’s gonna attempt to play it off and then he gets knocked out.
I wish for a good fight that goes to the late rounds & a KO so it’s not up to the judges. I feel this fight could go either way and respect to both men for making it happen
I feel Tommy is gonna win this fight he is more accurate than Jake with his shots
lmao if anyone thinks he’s an actual competitor is crazy
Jake is a mouth breather and has a banana shaped face, lol
Let’s hope Tommy doesn’t get the two bob bits 2 weeks before the fight
Blocked entry noo he wasn't his dad was not him
Please spark this clown 😊
If Tommy had any sense he would approach this like Eubank Jr with the 50 % talk and so on rather than building his work rate up with no headphones.
Tommy truly believes in himself, this is gonna be a fight
I like Tommy and wish him all the best to destroy this geezer, however if the  jp is victorious then I would consider him in a better light
Dunce
Tommy please humble that yank
Basically he is gonna take a dive.
Thought He was going to turn Green.
Not gonna lie, Tommy fumbled the ball so many times. But he's living rent free in Jake Paul's head lmao
Jake has trained and sparred with Anthony Taylor and Tommy struggled with him. It’s a tough fight to call
I can't wait to watch this tonight 😂😂😂
Has anyone ever seen Tommy throw what would be  considered a good punch.
I personally think Tommy got this like easy, just needs to be following the plan in the ring but he waffling to much in this video
I hope so but I've seen Tommy putting the audience to sleep with his paddycake boxing
People should tune in on 26th of February because it's going to be the end of an idiot 😂 Tommy is definitely a good trash talker like his brother
Notice its only boxing....same with mayweather....none of these chumps want mma smoke...they are one dimensional and cannot handle a true fight...jake paul gonna get smoked
i wanted to to believe tommy would win, but i honestly think hes gunna get knocked out lol
4 Weeks away is sudden
This fight isn't going....To happen
And your doing it for free.  Stop contradicting yourself over and over.  Get a grip m8
All of Tommys fights go the distance
Cmon Tommy put an end to the big mouth fool👊🏼👊🏼👊🏼
People in this comment section are such losers lmao
I didn't know Neymar was a boxing interviewer.
jake paul will pull out
Jake Paul is going to beat KSI
Can’t wait till tommy gets knocked out !!!
Wasn't interested in this fight but I saw the face off, Tommy looks jacked and I reckon Jake will pull out a week or so before the fight.
If Tommy loses then he should retire very young big John will disown him🤣🤣🤣
Poofs
Tbh i hate YouTube boxing but i will be tuning in for this fight. It will do big numbers.
Did Tommy not claim the same thing with Anthony pretty boy Taylor. Tommy talked like it was a sanctioned murder and had to go to a decision
Ok, just don't drop out this time please Tommy!
Only thing he has to remember is. Anyone who’s 200 lb and can throw a punch can knock out someone.
Jake our here fighting real boxers while ksi fighting waiters
He said on his previous fights,a big dirty knockout and he ended going the distance.
Tommy don't turn up fury
Pls Tommy, PLEASE BEAT HIM!
By the way he speaks you'd think he's a world beater... nothing further from the truth, he's an absolute lemon. Boring aswell
Really hope Timmy fumbles get cleaned out! Can’t stand the guy! At least that Jake Paul lives in America and we don’t see much of him, only on YouTube etc
A lot of fighters talk but I truly believe Tommy is going to obliterate Jake, if this fight happens lol
“Chris must come early for me” - Tommy Fury, 2023
I’ll give him one thing he speaks well. God knows how jake is the bookies favourite.
Tommy - the least intimidating boxer in history.
Tommy couldn’t even stop Anthony Taylor 😂
Even though I don't rate tommy, jake Paul's in big trouble in Saudi 🤣🤣🤣
I liked Tommy in the beginning but I think he and Danis are the worst fighters. Nothings worse than a fighter that pulls out.
He knows how to talk. I thought he was at the same maturity level as jake
I'd laugh if Jake pulls out
Deal wid Fury, deal wid him.
Not sure why so many people seem to hate on Tommy and I hope he sparks jake out and humbles him
This guy is a muppet. Pulled out twice, yet wont stop begging for the fight.
With the momentum that Jake has. Itll be a challenge. But if boxing is in his DNA who knows... he can win
Smfh lol most yall kno nothing bout boxing,never been in a ring or even keep up with the sport. Tonmy been boxing since 13 in amateur. So u cant compare Jake's fights wit Tommy fight lol please people stop being ignorant lmao
Jake Paul wins!
I’m glad Tommy is ready! Hope he wins.
I’m betting money on Tommy for sure
Jake Paul. UD. Remember this.
He says this every single time, yet 50% of his fights have gone the distance and they were against nobody's 🙄
What a fight not. Put your house on Tommy
I hope this fool does pull out cause mike perry will be a more entertaining fight
he talks a good game
A battle between two very average boxers but who made it very entertaining. Gotta give credit to them
Not going the distance. We all know the build won’t go the distance then the fight is outta the window.
Tommy is only 23 years old, some people need to give him credit, he’s still young, lot of weight on his shoulders to follow, I think he sparks jake Paul, but none the less, people can sit here and hate on the guy, he’s clarting a nice girl, got loads of money, living a great lifestyle, at 23? The only loser here is us commenting.
rooting for jake paul on this one
The fact that Tommy’s pulled out and is like I’m training hard… he’s kinda worried even if it’s a little bit
Its a paied fight aggain... jake will win cause he picks amateurs
Tbh I'm not sure Tommy could knock me nephew out, just needs to try and outbox him and not get caught, won't be watching it tho
Tommy looks like a British Superman
Fury is the sickest name for a boxer since Tyson
Tommy better put on his big girl pants on for this fight
If jake wins, who does he fight next?
Actually think Paul will win
Even if Tommy pulls out I read mike perry would be his replacement I'd rather see mike perry to be honest 😂😂
Jake Paul will kill him
Careers over if he gets beat.
This guy can't even show up for a press conference 😅🤡
Tommy boys growing up
But who in the F will actually pay to watch this trash?
Massive respect now for Tommy, starting to really like this guy <3
Where does Tommy go after this win if he even does win
In my opinion, Tommy wins by KO. Fair play to Jake for doing what he's done so far but this is another kettle of fish completely. As boxing goes though, may the best man win.
Guaranteed Paul beats him.
I hate to say it guys but we all know Tommy is going to lose Jake is alot better then he was and he's going to win.
I hope tommy gets ironed out now🇬🇧
Tommy had better not lose this fight lol
He looks like a tank.
Fury been avoiding a Youtuber for years now 😂if he pulls out again he needs to hang it up
Fumbles has less credibility than a nutted in sock.
Let's go jake please knock this clown out
Tommy's last fight was against an mma fighter and it he didn't close to knocking him out.  Tommy looked really bad. But im sure he will come better prepared for this fight....
Jake > tommy
Tommy going to sleep..
Better turn up man, joke Paul needs shutting the f up
2:19 sus
Lets be honest. He definitely would take a dive fir a trillion pounds
Ye can talk tha talk Tommy.... but can ye.. walk tha walk?!!!!
"He caught me"  Tommy Fury after getting Koe'd
Tommy's getting slumped by a Disney star
I would love to see him end Jake.
u knw aside the boxing the lad speaks very well every time i watch a interview i think he is a good boxer then I watch the fight and get back to reality. I think jake wins
Just tuuuuuuurn up this time Tommy 🤣🤣
But what if !!? 🤯
Still 95% sure he wont pitch.
This fight is not going to happen it doesn't take a genius to realize it soon as Jake Paul announce Mike Perry is the backup that says it all Jake is going to make some excuse that Fury pulled out the fight again and he's going to fight  perry mark my words🤣
No emotion yet says I run with no headphones thinking about Jake 😂
Tommy sounds like he is trying to convince himself.
Who cares! It's just a couple of average boxers, hats off to Paul though for manufacturing a boxing fantasy aura and making a ton of cash from it. Why would any serious professional boxer even consider fighting a fake boxer like Paul......money of course. What on earth has boxing come to!
This fight ain’t going the distance ? 😂😂😂  the guy has decision wins over scaffolders from Poland ffs have a day off Tom
Jake Paul will be injured before the fight like 1 week or something that 🤡 will not get into that fight
man Tommy is too confident. Waaaaaaay too confident. Jake's being massively underestimated.
He must have forgotten that he’s facing undefeated Jake Paul
Tommy actually seems relatively confident this time. Hopefully that translates into a win 🤞🏾
England vs USA, british will win, we fight smart, the yank knob ain't doing sh!t
Well spoken, hope jake gets what’s coming to him
If Tommy doesn’t pull out then I think this is ending in a draw
Dude sounds like my son when he says a trillion 😂
This is a dive
My guy! Time to end jake 🎉
it will go down to the judges.A draw lol
I love how Tommy thinks he’s a serious fighter when the reality is he’s just another influencer boxer
This is not gonna age well...
Tommy will pull out again
I want Tommy to win, but it'll be tough for him...
They need to parlay if this fight will happen or not
hope u lay him out tommy.Only dont think paul cant fight ,He can .
Ffs Tommy,pls spark this bump out,he needs to be humbled.amen
I like his confidence but I believe Tommy is truly under estimating Jake.
I really hope tommy backs it up with all he has said because if he doesn't then he's gonna look like a right tw*t
Seen jake and Tommy chatting away like two best friends who’d discovered a gold pot in Dubai near after the mayweather deji fight, fake beef…
2 years I thought TF would win
Fury knocks him out in 4 mark my words
“He had 2 lucky escapes to not take the fight”. When tommy was the one that escaped 😂😂
I can't stand Jake Paul, but I genuinely feel like he will beat Tommy.
Tommy fumbles 😂
easy win for Tommy
Tommy is going to Pull out he is a puppet
Rooting for u mate !!    Jake needs to be humbled.       Heads getting big.
I THINK JAKE WILL PULL OUT JAKES SHI,,,ING HIS PANTS 👊🤛💪
its not even going to happen lmaoooo bunch of jokers
this fight isn't going to happen
Jakey going down. He better stick with making YouTube vlogs after this
Jake might be a x Disney Star But Tommy was on Love Iand
Tommy couldn't even knock out Anthony Taylor. He's gonna get knocked out first round.
EASY FIGHT TOMMY 💪 👌
If tommy doesn’t let the pressure get to him on fight night, he’ll give jake a boxing lesson I truly believe that
I still don’t think this even going to happen.  It’s a nothing burger  at this point.
Tommy’s opponents record combined is like 20 wins and 200 losses.
ayo when did Ben Simmons become an interviewer?
6:44 i died. helluva jump scare.
Tommy will hopefully give Jake a good fight but I cant see him winning
Jake will pull out with a injury. Watch.
Tommy will win this. come back to this comment 27th of feb
Yeah yeah whatever fumbles. Anyhow come subscribe to us 🥊🥊
Tommy Fury realizes he’s comparing himself to Tyron Woodley and Anderson Silva. Both would absolutely kill Tommy
Please Tommy blast this guy out....
Please beat his azz
Another fighter get shamed. What the excuse? Utube powerful and unrated. LOL
great interview
He will back out again soon
There is literally zero chance jake paul beats him, he aint great but he's better than Jake paul. His fundamentals are non existent. Any amateur boxer would beat Jake his age and size.
Nobody cares Timmy
Fumbles is right it's not goin the distance because hes gettin knocked spark out 🤷🏻‍♂️🤣🤣🤣
Timmy watery is a joke he talks a big game and plays patty cake in there . The only reason he’s on a channel is cause of his brother.
What a scoop. 😂👍
Damn. All his visual indicators show he doesn’t believe most of what he’s saying. That’s not good.
Plenty of time for the fumbler to fumble his way out as usual. Keep your eyes 👀 open for him pulling out due to broken finger nail.
this Tommy is going down hard , the american gonna win ✌
I rate the confidence but this also concerns me a little, Jake isn't a good boxer but does have KO power and all he'll be looking for is that one shot the whole fight and all he needs to do is catch Tommy...so he needs to be careful but to me he seems to be too confident for comfort, from what i have seen Tommy just beat Jake but if not maybe call it a day.
What's funny is people actually believe it's Tommy ducking Paul😂😂
Don’t understand the hate Tommy gets, he’s clearly a good guy
This is literally the first fight of Jake's that I want him to win. Tommy is so unlikable. I guess I'm a jake paul fan now
"No head phones" !!!! 🤣
I actually think jakes gonna cause him some trouble
It's funny how the average person doesn't actually know him as a boxer until Jake wanted to fight him. He was only famous for being on Love Island.
No pressure apart from your dads gonna bend your girlfriend over while taking the family name away from ya
Tommy knows he going to lose
why do i feel like he’s gonna choke :(
Can't predict anything Tommy has some good pull out game
My money that this fight will never happen it will be canceled again and again and again
please knock him out tommy 🔥🔥🔥
I know footballers that would dive for a £100k and less in the premier league, let all 🤣🤣alone a trillion£ 😂
Tommy hasn't got the dedication Jake Paul has.
Back to back massive events and fights. 👏 Frank and Bob best in the game. Meanwhile Eggie still doubling down on getting Conor Benn pregnant. 💀
Turn down a trillion to take a dive? Does he believe that truly
Tommy "Lou Ferrigno" Fury #DontGetMeAngry 😡
Tommy Fury sold his soul to do circus boxing matches
Youtube  pretty boy doesn't realise what he's in for taking on the gypsy ilk - it's goodnight Irene.
I thought the title was Tommy fury excuses
Hopefully the fight isn't rigged like the silva fight  amen people seem to just move on when the fixed fights were happening smh ..
Yea he’s going to sleep😭😂
I think Jake paul.can pull off the win.really do ..🔥🔥🔥
Both fools.
Mans is so confident he’s gonna end jape paul. I just hope he can actually do it; if he gets knocked out by Jake his boxing career is done.
Why is jake fighting tommy 1 month after tommy fought? Hes given him no time to recover.
Please brake him up, Another big mouth yank Be nice to see he's eyes like this 🤪🤪 On the way to this 😴😴😴🙏🇫🇴👍
Jake paul is not a boxer people need to understand he is a plank 🤣🤣🤣
Go do some ecstasy and shut up
Letting everyone know in advance: Boxing Talk gone wrong!
A lot off ppl r underestimating Tommy Fury😬🤷🏽‍♂️
trillion pounds yeah? cut the cap fam lol
Tommy has all the assets except for ability, the youtuber Vs the reality star.Twentythree years old professional boxer and never fights.
No fan of either but I want Jake Paul to win for the simple fact Big John said he would disown Tommy if he losses let's see if Big Johnny is a man of his word! 🤣 💯
Calm and collective and has the talk and commitment to follow it through just don’t underestimate your opponent it only takes one lucky hit. Go in and do the job and finish it otherwise your career is done
Ur gonna lose as much as I hate Jake Paul I could probably beat u
Tommy lad Please KNOCK this boy out 🇮🇪
A complete joke ,who is interested
CANT WAIT FOR PAUL VS PERRY!
Mark my words there is going to be fuckery afoot.
Jake doesn't have to pay Tommy, he only has to pay off a couple of judges and not get KO'd. With Tommy's punching power it shouldn't be impossible.
Tommy shouts a lot he wants to be world champion one day so if he gets beat by an ex-Disney star who's only been boxing for 3yrs he can never fight again how can he go back to fighting ranked fighters after getting beat by jake Paul? I believe jake beats Tommy for some reason I think jake knocks him out. If jake does best him there's no way Tommy can fight any top boxer.
Hopefully the fight isn't rigged like the silva fight
At the end of the day...
This dummy ran away 2 times already. Does he really think people have forgot the fact Tommy was too scared to box Jake Paul.
Tyson ain't confident in Tommy he said if Tommy wins he wants Tommy to fight KSI he knows Tommy ain't that guy
I want to put a bet on tommy pulling out
I believe Jake beats him and I'm betting everything i own on it big ol pay day coming
The blonde bomber is going to k.o this influencer😂😂
It's all show for sales. They don't not like each other when u see them meet in the hall stuff was about to go down and they both stopped it so they could look into each others eyes. (For hype and sales). It's all smoke and mirrors with the pauls
I’m quite convinced Tommy is getting sparked out 😂😅 #BigMoney
I’m having big money on Tommy 🇬🇧 💪🏻
This fight ain't going the distance because this fight won't happen yet again
I'm surprised he is having a baby, with All the pull out his did.
Every fight paul has had,  the fighters constantly have their hands down. Not that he took advantage of an oppertunity,  they drop their hands to throw s punch.  They've all been ready pickings in boxing
Sorry, but I feel like Tommy's going lose. He couldn't take down Pretty Boy and he went the distance
This fight won't happen, Tommy will take a dive, or it will end up a draw.
Plenty of time to pull the plug on it
It's not going the distance because he will pull out 💀
He is a beast^^ I dont want to fight him even if he had just one arm!
JUST FIGHT FOR GOD SAKE it's just a mental game this cause if Tommy wins then it's because he's a boxer not a YouTuber Muppet but if he loses then he got beat by a YouTube Muppet with a George Micheal earring in just go in and smash him up man
“an end of an idiot” 😂 please do it👍
Bro I like what he responded when they asked him about his last name.  “I’m not Tyson… I’m just trying to be the best version of me” gotta respect the man for that mentality. There’s a lot of internet trolls going after these boys and all they tryna do is put on a show.
7:02 "Its going to be the end of an idiot" - Go on Tonmy
Seems like Tommy is itching on the twilight train.
Hope I'm wrong...but Tommy is so robotic and slow, I think he loses.  I think Jake is stronger, quicker, and will pull out the victory.
Let's make sure it is tommy.
Never seen someone talks this much since Eubank jr
“Mark my words” 😂
Just have to screenshot every tommy fury hate comment so I can come back after the fight and laugh😂 jake Paul can stick to boxing washed up ufc stars, YouTubers and old bball players after he gets knocked no cap 💀
If Jake beats him fair play but can’t see it happening
This guy is such a simp
The fight 100% wont go the distance. Could not agree more!  If it actually does take place, Tommy will definitely get knocked out.
Wtf josh denzel doing interviews boxing a joke
C'mon tommy knock the div out. English pride at stake.
Making it to the fight is the more important thing here ;)  But please Tommy, spark Jake Paul!
Every person Jake Paul faught was close to 40yrs old and up so now we gone get to see if he can still stand on it. #iDoubtIt
Jake Paul has never fought a boxer he won’t beable to tell when he’s being set up he won’t know what to look for Tommy will absolutely destroy him
So if Tommy was a "World Class" boxer, why did he DUCK Paul 2 times already? Cus Jake Paul is going to beat yo A$$ Tommy!
I don’t really like Jake, but I think I like Tommy less. Either way, i’d put my money on Jake.
tyson looked like he just ripped a few lines in da restroom ehhh
Hopefully Jake wins to shut up one of the Fury's, Jake is his toughest opponent to date which is hilarious.
Jake wins this fight 💪🏻
he can't pay me a trillion pounds to take it easy but pulling out is absolutely free
as a brit im fully behind Tommy and belive hell get the W no problem. The amount of people that have turned on Tommy is ridiculous especially fellow brits.
I hope he is a real boxer. It will be depressing if he gets beat.
I’m betting $500 to anyone who doesn’t think he’s doing to pull out again
TOMMY FUMBLES
I’m already knowing this has a set up for Jake Paul to win. Because of this, too many boys go to the backyard and learn to throw a punch and then say things like “I’ll beat Mike Tyson” etc.
Hope Tommy gets humbled. First time rooting for Jake.
I’d much prefer it if Tommy just played it down and said with very few words Jake Paul’s getting knocked out. Calmly with little words. All these words is too much
I'm rooting forr. fury, buit Paul has way more natural confidence, I cant see Fury winning
He's gonna have to take that hair Gel out or he won't make weight.
Jake can beat him i wouldn't be surprised if Jake does beat him
Tommy fury is no longer relevant fight somebody else Jake Paul  zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz Tommy dropped out of the fight too many times. I’m just over it. Him
Let’s be honest, JP has had better and tougher fights than tommy. And yeah that’s saying something. Because he’s fought a 40+ year old silva and a washed up woodley. Tommy hasn’t shown the skill level or power than JP has. I want tommy to win but I very much doubt he can win this..
This fight will make history. People are predicting that this fight will bring in as many as 100 ppv buys!
Tommy fury is as much of a boxer as I am a cricket player ~ Luke rockhold former ufc champion
10er on Paul
Tommy is a A$$ 🤡!
It pains me to say I think Jake beats Tommy. Jake has been dedicated to boxing for the last 4 years. Tommy likes the thought of being a boxer more than actually being a boxer.
Yo these Jake Paul fans are funny in the comments 😂.  Realistically Tommy should KO Paul lol. 3 years younger. Comes from boxing. His older brother is undoubtedly the best heavyweight we've seen in the last 15 years.  Jake Paul knows the writing is on the wall in my opinion. He signed with PFL for a MMA future because the gimmick is done. It's do or die now that he faces a boxer. I'm confident to say Fury wins.
So if Jake doesn't win then what? Are we all going to be like "Ohhhhhhhhhhh!" Or does it even matter since he's just making noise shaking up boxing an not even a professional boxer? 🤔
as must i dislike Jake , Tommy talking just doesn't offer me confidence , hope i am wrong
Lmao a lot of y’all are jake fan boys. The difference will show tommy ko’s him round 3
tommy is a funny guy
Prediction: Fight goes the distance and Jake Paul wins. Ofcourse in some controversial manner.
This fight will only take place on a ps5 or Xbox.
Jake will knock him out
looks like a pretty likable guy in my eyes tbh.
2 privileged guys fighting. Whoever buys this PPV has been scammed
Who cares 2 youtubes
Damn Ben Simmons fell off
DELUDED PEOPLE IN COMMENTS. Fury KO
I really hope paul ends up in a wheelchair for the rest of his life after this
Tommy will win this fight.Tommy has got to win this fight for all of us that want to see Jake Paul get smacked about off an Englishman HOWAY TOMMY LETS FXCKIN DO THIS 👏👏👏👏🐜🍄
Pull out king
I used to be tommy all day but jp fought better and looks a better fighter so its a 50 50
Lucky the fight isn't in "Hamsterdam" loooool
Please Tommy make it happen.
Tommy sounds mad confident, this will come back to haunt him if he pulls out or if he gets knocked out in the ring lmao
Still don’t believe he’s showing up for the fight 😂
So funny if timmy gets sparked out… Tyrone Woodley style 🎳
John 3:16
Don't pull out again
Weeks and weeks and months and months 😂 guys brain is gone
He is going to find a way to pull out of this fight for the third time
Wow not even a trillion! Lol
Frank Bruno talked like this before Tyson 2, anyway good luck Tommy.
If Tyson isn’t around his training. I do think Jake wins this. But Tommy is serious and following what Tyson tells him. Tommy wins
I don't know why but I can see Tommy getting dropped but wins the fight tho lol
good luck
I think Tommy loses. Should be a good scrap.
Tommy is getting knocked out
Jake Paul is about to pull out watch
Like Tyson said, Tommy is a Youtube boxer. I want to see Jake spark his lights out. The man is a mug!
I’m quite warming to Tommy
6:44 Mcgregor moment
I don’t understand why everyone think Jake’s going to beat Tommy.. Tommy is a gypsy, gypsy blood they are born to fight, tommys been boxing all his life 20 years maybe, jake Paul has been boxing only 5 years, there is no contest for Tommy. Jake is a decent boxing but Tommy is a different level than Jake
i will be streaming this fight illegaly
so many deluded Paul fans in the comments. Guys a fraud
We know he would take a dive for a trillion. He would do it for $10 million pounds
Furry will be the victorious in this fight! He will knock-out Paul for at least 24 hours!
Delusion
The worse trash talker in boxing history , closely followed by the juggernaut
just saw Tommy Furys pro record and to be fair it aint much better than Jake Pauls with exception og Tommys last fight. Tommys pro debut was against a fella who had a 10-102 record and 4 out of his 8 opponents had zero wins on their record.
Please don't tell me THIS AGE WELL  after Jake Won 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Training camp for his mouth looks like
i bet one of them doesnt pass the drugs test
pull out lol
Fight wont happen
i still have question marks over how good Tommy is and could be.. it would be really Embarrassing if he got beat by Jake Paul
yh it aint going the distance cuz tommys gonna get knocked tf out and he still wont be able to experience 8 rounds
I want Tommy to win, But its a 50/50  fight. Cause Tommy as a  very few professional fights, and Jake even though a Youtuber . As had least 2 years to develop his boxing skills.
Tommy makes me laugh , I do like the lad but he reminds me of how my 4 year old son speaks. "I been training for weeks and weeks and months and months"
tommy 'the strange lookin fooker fury' is gettin knocked out!
Tommy fury lost already letting Jake call him out #disrespectful
Anyone who hasn't lumped money on Fury whilst he is 'bookies underdog' doesn't know boxing. Tommy isn't anywhere near world level, but it won't matter as he is levels above Paul.  Jake looked terrified in the ring when they came face to face.
I'm not convinced.
I respect both these guys as a fighter. As a big fan of boxing strangely I am leaning more towards Jake Paul winning. talk is cheap. Let’s see what happens.
Please teach Jake Paul a lesson of his life, Respect from South Africa 🇿🇦
I so want to see Tommy knock him out cold starch!
This guys such an idiot inth8nk he gets kod by Paul tbh
I can see jake pulling out the decision but I hope for England n the fury legacy I hope Tommy smokes him
tommy does have better technique no doubt about it but does he have the chin and the cardio to go 10 rounds when he’s only been having 4 round exhibitions we’ll see
tommy fury is definitely better technically but i think he is going to crack under pressure of this fight
Win some titles 🙈😂😂
Jakes done well, fair play to him. Honestly couldn't care less who wins lol
I love how Tommy talks about boxing since he's 6 years old, training for 16 weeks and sparring with "world class" fighters but his actual opponent is a Youtuber who's been boxing for just 3-4 years and everybody is expecting it to be a 50/50 fight. I mean just look at the facts, how can tommy talk like he's this magnificent fighter while this is the situation he's in?
This fight will not happen one of those guys will break a nail a week before the fight ffs
I honestly think tommy was taking it easy and not trying in his last 2 fights just to lead jake in I think Jakes in for a shock
There will be a KO.
Tommy for the win..  jake is done.
Great to see BT's monopoly over Dead british boxing still going strong. pushing their golden goose into the media. Expecting biased coverage from junk  newspapers too.  Will BT sports be doing the pay per views Or have they been dwarfed by a Youtuber
tommy is an actual fighter with a 50% knockout rating. i think if this is a straight up boxing match with no diving fury has this fight. Jake is amateur level good but pro level hasn’t been proven yet
First time I'm rooting for Jake Paul 😆  Can't stand this 🤡
Fury has done this his whole life,paul is going to lose and look like a clown doing so
It’s funny all the hate he gets off of ugly lazy jealous men. He’s younger than most of yous commenting and already done more
Mad how these two were on both on love island at the same time 😂
Tommy stick tae love Island, yr a sausage
Who let's josh denzel do these interviews. Cause he went to a fury fight once he gets the gig
Will Flurry is a cool cat. I can't recall seeing too many interviews of him! Much bigger boxing test than Anderson Silva, Tyron Woodley, Nate Robinson, or Ben Askren. Paul will either earn a lot of respect or take an L
No more excuses. Let's see if Tommy steps into the ring.
Fumble will pull out 🤣
I've actually quit gambling 3 years ago.. but im making a comeback just to put money on Jake Paul. free money
Surely he would take the dive for a trillion pounds.
I hope he slumps Jake its about  time!!
Let's see who withdraws from the fight
Hope Tommy can do it, bc all his last opponents sound exactly like this
Cant believe this is box office and Beterbiev Yarde was free. Mind blowing
Jake is gonna knock bro out
come on tommy!!!!!!!!!
When Tommy talks he doesn’t even sound like he believes himself
They should do more press , especially Tommy.
He doesnt know what a trillion is hahaha the 2 dumbest men on earth its like going back to the stone age
Jake paul gonna flatten that pikey
I hope so Tommy i don't want to see that boxingtroll anymore.
I thinks he going to smash jake 👍 lol tinny will hit harder than anyone he’s fought I think this will be jake actual first test hope hrs gets sparked
Ur not a fighting man
Tommy is a rookie
Tell me why I think he going to pull out again and for the so called broken rib he never showed an X-ray of it when it’s so easy to prove if it’s true‼️
To long for his liking lmao, hes ran the whole time. Love to see them knock each other out then open a bed an breakfast together
I remember Tommy fighting a ginger haired lad ( Jordan Grant) much smaller than Tommy and still took him the distance and at times had Tommy in trouble . The Bookies have got It right having Jake Paul the favourite   I'm very confident Jake Paul will beat Tommy fury  .
" a Tyson comes along every hundred years" 😂 . aye fkn Mike Tyson!
I seriously think Tommy is going to pull this off. Jake is so bad.
Tommy will either stop jake or win on points. Anyone saying tommy will lose is dumb and obviously falling for the hype because of his knockouts against old mma fighters jake ahas power and I respect his dedication to the sport but Tommy is young too big and is the best pure boxer jake Paul will fight to date with Tommy’s reach and size he will overwhelm jake KO 3-4 rounds!! FURY 🔥
How much is this fight?
Let's hope Tommy gets the L
Who ever pay for this amateur freak show, should consider himself an idiot. Disgusting this fellow and his big mouth all the time.
Jono b is speaking absolute facts tommy ain't a great boxer and is also a novice I think Jake wins and I'm a boxing purist Jake has a better team and spars world champions and tommy spars average guys so there's a edge to Jake's game
I’ll be honest I rate Tommy’s confidence but I think he’s surrounded by a bunch of yes men. Gives me Logan Paul and Shannon Briggs vibes with him and his dad.
6:45 ??????😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I really wanna see Jake paul get ray mercered like when Tommy Morrison got koed,the only difference was tommy Morrison was actually respectable and a bit more humble than jake paul
He's right. It won't go the distance, because it'll never happen. He'll fumble it again.
Sure enough!! Tommy will smash this fool around any ring!!
Jakes been played saw Tommys performances and Tysons mind games sitting on the fence. Either Jake pulls out or Tommy gives him a wake up even if Jake wins he’s going to have to really work for it
My humble opinion is, Tommy gives Jake a humbling first loss. Camden New Jersey rep
Tommy u ain't got no excuses if u lose .no knockout power either.im no fan of Jake Paul but I ain't feeling tommy
This guy's a bigger joke then Jake and that's saying something.
Id bare in mind, he's been training with his brother and his dad. He should be the b#ll#x!
Even if Jake takes an L, it'll be an L to an actual boxer and he can just bide his time until he gets a few more wins under his belt....relatively minimal damage to his brand. If Tommy loses, he gotta find a new surname, occupation and family so pressures all on him....my money is on a JP knockout
Still don’t think it happens…
He sold that well
£50 for this pay per view is a bit steep.
His admittance to the training intensity tells me he knows he has to be up for this fight despite what he’s portraying in this interview.  Not into the YouTube boxing per say, but this one I will likely follow.
Really hope Tommy knocks him tf out
finally gonna get smashed out, lool
I'll only believe this fight when the bell rings
I genuinely like this guy he is humble I hope he gets the victory he actually better than I thought he has good boxing punches form especially when he keeps his punches short that's where his power is and he can definitely knock Jake out if he doesn't get to excited because Jake loads up on that right hand when he has opportunity so be careful
it's going to be a close fight I'm sure, both guys are young, both have great trainers and great teams, both really want it, both really need the win. 🍿
Props to Fury not cowarding out this time. Hopefully Paul goes easy on him. So we get to watch a few rounds before the big KO. No boxer stands a chance with the athletes from YouTube.
Tommy ain’t got a chance let’s be real 😂
He's right. Jake will put him to sleep.
I think Tommy has his head in the right direction.  He knows what he's doing
I'm not buying but I will watch highlights
HUGE FAN OF FURY CAMP. HOWEVER I DO BELIEVE Tommy will lose to knockout . Jake is  a strong mature build yet Tommy is a few years to that.
Not a surprise, the last few bouts between them didn't go the distance.
Jake eats his food
Seen guys come out of prison with better tattoos, on them, than Jake Paul's tattoos. This dude actually paid someone (obviously not a tattoo artist) to f••• his appearance up.
Cant wait to see Tommy get slept
The lack of self awareness from tommy is incredible, he ridicules who joke has fought when he's fought no one. He acts like he's prime Mike tyson 😂. Fact is if it wasn't for tyson  fury no one would know who he is
I think Paul has it. Tbh.
Well that's it folks Tommy wasn't wearing headphones while running so I'm betting the house on him
This guy is a clown. He's not a real boxer
6:45
6:46 be the whole summary of the interview
Tom will go to sleep
Tommy miah, just dont get injured and actually fight dude
Tommy face looks like he never taken a bang in the face.
It's gonna end up being vs Mike Perry and if not either way it's a ko for Jake Paul
As much as I dislike the Paul Brothers and like the Fury brothers, I can't say that I have confidence in Tommy winning. I hope Tommy improved a lot since the last fight I watched of him cause his technique seemed subpar vs that something Taylor dude, and Paul has improved a lot.
Jake's McGregor impersonation is adorable 😍
Well I think il be putting a bet on for Tommy to win a day before the fight I wonder what the odds would be lol 😂
This fight is super interesting. If Jake loses, he will be clowned like crazy
This fight will likely be a draw
3:09 this was the most important part of this interview. Win or lose, oblivious or not... I'm actually starting to like Tommy and his chill with this scenario.
6:44 I've no idea why that happened, but it was hilarious 😭😭😭 lol 🤣
I think this will be the best matchup for Jake so far.
"Even if I didn't train, my heart alone would get me through it."  Bro sounds like KSI! 😂
I hope Tommy wins but his trash talking is terrible
2 and half years in the making ? 2 and half years in rehearsal more like
The only time I've wanted Jake to win. TF boils everyone's piss. Still think he's going to pull out which wouldn't be a bad thing. Mike Perry v Jake would be much more fun.
I feel bad for this man. He's not winning
As much as I want tommy to have him I feel like jake is going to have an edge against him. I think Jake wants it more than him .
Man if he loses,, to a yt, how does he come bk from that
Tommy better watch it. Paul definitely has power. I think Tommy has better boxing but Never forget power!
Tommy will need to knock him out to get the W. They’ll never hand him the win on the scorecards since Jake is the cash cow. Just like Paddy’s last fight.
This guys uses the same lines every time 😅
Jake Paul is a more experienced and better fighter than Tommy Fury. Tommy is in for a shock.
I got Tommy winning.
Tommy TNT Fury though😝 Couldn't punch he way out of a paper bag and will pull out again anyway🤣🤣🤣
This fight is intense, I'm definitely buying this
Jakes gonna knock him out, first few rounds.
It won’t go the distance. Tommy is getting knocked out
Bruh the fights never happened because of him. This guy is going to pull out. It doesn’t take two years to fight a “YouTuber” or a “Disney star”. This guy is delusional.
TOMMY IS GETTIN KNOCKED SPARK OUU
Goofy ahh editing 💀
Tommy do us brits proud bro from glasgow SCOTLAND TRAINSPOTTINGS FINEST
5:00 why do I feel like this is going to be tweeted a lot at the end of February
If he loses he is going to be the biggest embarrassment to the UK he'll never be able to show his face again
Tommy is going to smash Jake for sure. This the first real fight where Jake is not going against old folk. This is were he meets his first L.
When they first was gunna fight I thought Tommy would smoke Jake but now I’m not soo sure, watched a few of Tommy’s fights back and I think Jake could get the W.
Bookies got jake smashing him🤣Tommy says he bets his whole life🤷🏼‍♂️
Everyone writing Tommy out of this fight strictly because he pulled out twice before I see this fight going through distance with Tommy out pointing him massively.
Another guy underestimating jake
Jake gonna shove his American sausage down this fairy's gob
I hope tommy likes the taste of American sausage because he'll be choking on jakes tool
Backing fury for sure really hope tommy puts jakes lights off dislike the guy tbh and his con man brother both sausages
I strongly believe this fight will end in a draw
He’s going to have to stick to the reality tv
Sorry to say, but this guy is not that good a boxer, dont like Jake paul but he will knock fury out.
Calling it now tommy pulls out with a injury
Tommy can't even spell trillion
I can actually it being a draw
Jake is coming off the PEDS cycle. If Tommy was smart, he would get him tested right now and expose the lying cheat fraud of Jake
This fight isn't happening full stop.... Jake already got a backup fighter for when fumbles backs out
Tommy has this fight jake is sparring with bums who get knocked out
I really do hope Tommy does knock him out now! I don’t think he can even afford this to be a close fight or let it go to points.
What a joke !!
Not a fan of any of this but for once i hope paul whoops this dude
Two prats boxing for 8 2 minute rounds. Woah, crazy.
Tommy wants all the benefits that come along with being a boxer, just without the boxing part 😂
Tommy is gonna look worse than Tyron Woodley
TOMMY GONNA BREAK HE is lvls above Jake 😈#LEVELS#TNT
Wont believe they are fighting until they are both in the ring
He couldn’t pay Tommy a trillion quid to show up either 😂 Can’t wait for Jake vs Mike Perry
Jake Paul maybe killed..😐
I hate Jake but Tommy is nothing special he just have the Fury name I think even KSI beats easily Tommy
cant take this guy seriously
Will Fury is a decent boxer this should be a good fight
Lot of hate for tommie, and support for a YouTube who hasn’t faced a single pro boxer. We are living in the age of celebrity man love. Let’s see where the haters are if tommie flattens him
All the things he said so far we’re exactly the same before he pulled out
None can box  both a joke I'd fight both same night for £50.000
Can’t wait for Tommy to get knocked out.
Surprised he didn't pull out of this interview...
I'll be surprised if this fight even gonna happen.
Both got to turn up first lol
He better do the job. Or he will be a novice fighter for ever.
Man's a tosser!!!! Hope he actually shows up
He doesn't believe it himself, 🤣. Good luck getting dropped by a Disney star
All I no is this not that bothered....but I hope fury wins
Guarantee he will come in overweight so it will be made a exhibition match instead.  He's a joke. Jake is the one reviving Tommy's career offering him the fight.  Wasn't heard of until he used tysons name to get on love Island, his boxing since then has been a utter failure.... yet he thinks he's the man 😂
Watched half of this, got bored.. Honestly who cares.. I don't..
okay lol as u should mf
Wonder what his excuse for pulling out will be this time? Are people really going to pay to watch this? Of course they are
If Tommy loses he better permanently move to love island and switch off social media.
Anyone else think it's been too long, and jake paul will now beat him?
World class sparring has that lad from Carlisle not just put a vid out saying he’s sparring tommy
Jake better bring it or he might be going sleepy time.
Tommy's smart. If he pulls out which means the fight doesn't happen it's not going the distance then . Be like Tommy.
Please Finish Jake Paul no pressure Just finish him end this madness!!!
Were they both on the same series of love island?
Anyone know if there is a rematch clause 🤔
Jake is gonna stop him and this is coming from a KSI fan
Tommys talking a lot seems really confident if he loses to Jake Paul he’s finished in the boxing industry game over.
He couldn't even stop Antony Taylor what's he chatting about  🤣
Tommys gna smash him
Everyone forgetting that Jake Paul hasn’t actually fought any boxers yet and also assuming he’ll win because he fought either smaller opponents or retired mma fighters who were all above 40. Tommy is actually younger than him, he’ll have a motor like no one Jake had fought, and he hits harder and trains with the heavyweight champion of the world.  It’s silly to assume that Jake will win.
Tommy has the chance to become a Universal Hero.
He obviously has the ability but he is so gun shy when he fights.
It’s a shame for Tommy and Jake because Salt Papi is gonna spark em all 🧨 🧂 !!!
I am predicting the Result will be draw.
I'm definitely putting a decent lump on Fury when I think the price is at its highest
If we’re being honest Tommy said this about his last 5 opponents and they all went the distance your not a knock out puncher bro 😂
The reason the fight was announced only 30 days away? Someone is coming off a cycle or both by the looks of it
Didn't he literally just get paid too take it easy on the Mayweather undercard 🤣🤣
Not a jake paul fan but he's gonna f*** tommy up.
If he loses to Jake Paul an absolute joke of a boxer then he should never fight again.
2 youtubers fighting each other. Tommy is a joke of a boxer tbh
Yep a draw then
Try and show up first Tommy yeah... sh*t house
Tommy can’t even really fight man Jake gon beat him
Jake will KO Fury just like Woodley. 💴 talks bullshit walks 😂
Swear every time I see this man I get less confident
i agree with tommy the fight isnt going the distance...because hes not showing up
The world famous Will Fury
I want Tommy to win but Paul's experience will let him take it Jake is there to be countered but I just don't Tommy has the timing pr speed to counter him properly Tommy is going to get caught jabbing in
The way he sits says he's going to lose, might be wrong but have got a feeling he gets knocked out and goes on to star in strictly come dancing and wins
How does one brother look like giga chads baby and the other looks like Bigfoot had a baby with a human
Just looking at boxrec and theres nothing there that suggest Tommy is capable of knocking him out, especially in the past 2 year
KSI is such a duck 💀 🦆
Tommy can barely throw punches, yet he talks like world destroyer. He should be more humble with his performances. Jake can easily win.
This guy couldnt knock a midget out
I'd like to think tommy has more in him. Maybe these "16" weeks of training finally show us his real ability. If he doesn't walk jake down then he might lose.
its like Tommy is completely oblivious to the fact this is his biggest fight to date & likely still will be for years to come
I want to see Jake Paul fight JustaMinx😂
Jake is gonna walk right through pillow fisted Timmy
Absolutely no self awareness whatsoever 😂
Jake is going to knock him out. I'll be surprised if they actually fight.
Come back to this comment when Tommy inevitably pulls out
Tommy is all talk til he does what he says. He has been completely underwhelming until now.
Tommy fury has done nothing  in all the years hes been out except  look like a pretty boy  living off the family name .Hes the real boxer out of the two  so the pressure  is on him.
Jake Paul
Tommy the chubby
It went the distance with Anthony. I really think either Jake knocks him out or it goes to points with Jake up on the score cards
Jake Paul beats him
So far jake got much higher achievements in boxing
Never mess with a gypsy traveller
....and check out all the 12 year old jake paul fans below that all of a sudden in last few months are now boxing experts lol
freakin brilliant, i cant wait for tommy to smash that idiot to a pulp
He lacks ambition saying out here in public he can’t be a world class boxer.
Tommy should beat Jake but I don't trust the bout will go ahead if so it would not surprise me to see a draw and a return bout
Tommy is a liar,. His been a professional for years and hardly had a fight, hope he gets KO
Third time's a charm  Right?
Tommy is a better boxer but just cuz he could throw a punch better doesn’t automatically means he wins, Jake has knockout power so he could be losing most of the rounds then suddenly boom lol all it takes is one punch..but I still think Tommy wins.
If Tommy lose. He would  embarrassed his Legacy and Fury tree line.
6:43 caught me off guard😂😂
I don't believe what tommy says couldn't knock out the last guy he faced pshh
This video gave me the confidence im putting 10k on Tommy
A Pro Boxer v YouTuber. Over 2 years in the making. 🤣 WTAF
He's gonna lose woudnt surprise me if he pulls out again. Tommy coudnt even take out Anthony Taylor so how does he think he knocks out Jake
After all furys performances I cant take him seriously
When the fight was announced the 1st time around I thought Tommy had it in the bag. Now I think Jake lights him up like a xmas tree
Always backing 🇬🇧
lol he better not drop out like last time then
