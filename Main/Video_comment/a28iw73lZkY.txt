I’m a Chelsea fan but that was not a penalty for the 2nd
Chelsea are the real deal this season. Can only get better!
I feel sorry for not the Chelsea’s goalkeeper
Timo Perner
lets just say it was 2-0 cos that red card technically didn't count
Werner is winning pens because he's too fast for the defenders to make a proper tackle and so they have to foul him.
Refs like him should never be reffing again. Its actually shocking!
I'm a Chelsea supporter but I feel like the ref was a bit biased on that red card, I do think it was a pen but not a second yellow for the ball deflecting to his arm. It's not like it was intentional
Werner is such a diver!!!!
Wahay
Racism still exists in football. The referee sent the guy off for being black. Horrible!
Abraham is a pile of gash aswell how he got in the England team ahead of Bamford and Wilson is a joke.
Soft pen for chelsea i see.. what a surprise.
Scxf.
Ccc ccc          Ccc ccc    Ccc cc hello  Everly
Mendys made about 4 saves in the last 5 matches its the defence doing good not him
2:59 Jorginho's signature pass
Terrible ref
Cultural enrichment. 2 penalty.  Go Chelsea!
Even as a chelsea fan I have to disagree w the second pen, not only did it hit his leg first but his arm is clearly moving down b4 the ball starts moving up towards it. Also how tf is it a second yellow.
Why tf is werner in rw he needs striker role ffs
Even as a Chelsea fan that is by no means a red card debatable whether it was even a pen
A red card for getting unlucky. That feels really bad.
Timo Werner only scores penalty’s cus he’s that bad
The ball hit him on the chest for the 2nd penalty.
That second penalty was a joke wtf was that about
Var is a joke how is that a pen 🤦‍♂️
2 champions league games in a row, dreadful penalties have been awarded, 2 foot away ball blasted at them hit leg rebounds onto arms. These defenders better start putting their arms inside their shirts. Piss poor VAR decisions.
That red card was unfair it was accidental, don't like refs like that
What's score gunna b when u play Leeds 7-7
never a pen
Are defence has improved since southampton
LOOOL that red card what a joke
Werner dived
What happened to the "ball to hand" rule?. I haven't heard it in years
I thought they specifically changed the rule so if it deflects off a body part on to your arm it isn't a handball?
I thought zouma was gonna do what Jr find last time  Zouma Messiah zouma
Am I blind but was Abraham not offside?
I’m a die hard Chelsea fan but that second pen and red was bs VAR is ruining football
VAR is being used awfully
VAR is a good thing. Now just bring good referees.
Not a fair game dont count as a clean sheet this was a unfair match
VAR ruined that game
Not so sure either was a pen. Being tickled is no reason to launch yourself to the floor. Werner loves a rest on the deck it would seem from his games in Blue so far.
Who saw Abraham saying “my boy” to William 😹 2:52
And everyone is complaining about how bad the premier league refs are...
Werner is a far better Penalty taker than Jorginho with his little hop penalties. Never a pen for the second and how was it a yellow? Also- it's 50/50 between Reece James and TAA for England right back now. Both fantastic crossers.
Even as a utd fan how was that a red var Is retarded
3:15 if Gomes didn’t get a touch on it I want to know where tf Abraham was putting that ball
Double jeopardy for the second yellow for 'Dalbert' I'm guessing that is his name. Poor refereeing. One of the worst decisions in the UCL this week
Instantly turn off sound, cant listen to glenn hoddle and his annoying accent
i dont think it was a pen or second yellow and im a chelsea fan...
How ridiculous is that penalty and red card decision?!?
That CB didn’t deserve the red but the penalty both times was justified. Good win either way for Chelsea
WHO ARE HIRING THESE REFS? Somebody seriously needs to give them all a knock on the head...jesus christ
100% penalty, he goes to smother the ball with his arms ffs
Ruining the game this handball thing...
that was not a penalty at all nor a sending off ridiculous Chelsea are becoming another united just getting penalties
Never a pen
Never a penalty. But then again Chelsea ALWAYS get soft decisions at home because they pay referees to do so.
Chelsea's new players are flops they should not be struggling to a side like Rennes against Rennes with 10 men .
Softest penalties the world can witness
That red was tripping
As a Chelsea fan i'm happy with another win and the 6th clean sheet.  But as a football fan that 2nd pen was not a pen, was not hand ball and was not a yellow.  We'll take the win but VAR needs work.
I'm a chelsea fan and the 2nd pen is outrageous, shouldn't have been a pen
I am truly losing interest in football do these officials care about the game
2 penalties 🙃
Ladies and gentlemen we have now got our courtois replacement
Could have been 6 0
This new handball rule is shocking
Champions League just doesn't feel the same without fans
Great win by Chelsea, both penalty decisions were very harsh on Rennes. KTBFFH
The fact that he has given him a second yellow card for that is an absolute joke. Those handballs shouldn't even be penalties.
I don't know if they changed the rules but it used to be that if the ball struck a part of your body before it hit your hand, it didn't count as handball...
Never a penalty or a 2nd yellow card. How on earth could he prevent the ball hitting his arm? Uefa has gone mad with their interpretation of "hand ball".
They need to sort out the handball rule.. there is no man on earth who could of moved their hands out the way of a ball going that fast, that close...
If we can play like how we did as soon as we came out for the second half, every game, no one will be able to defend us
That’s not a bloody pen 😂🤦🏿‍♂️
That might have been the harshest Handball and Redcard I've ever seen
This is a joke, VAR killed this game, Dalbert getting carded for the ball hitting his arm without him even being aware
There's absolutely no way that's a handball what the hell is the guy meant to do? It's now down to teams like Chelsea shoulda refused that second pen. It can happen to any team so they all need to stick together cz this is getting out of hand. No pun intended
No way was that a sending off or a pen, ref needs to give his head a wobble... Good performance from the boys thou, feel like the team is galvanising more and more each match 💙
chelsea fan but that pen is one of the worst refereeing decisions ive ever seen
Chelsea’s 8th penalty in in 11 games but we wont hear anything about it because they’ve not Manchester united.
The penalties against Rennes in this game and Leipzig in the other one make me ask myself if the handball rule has been changed?
The second pen should’ve definitely not been a pen or a yellow card. His hands were near his body and it was ball to hand
These rules are ruining the game
How's that a penalty when the ball ricocheted off his leg?  Football game has become a joke for the past couple of years now, it's not a Man's sport anymore! I've seen penalties been awarded for just a simple touch..
No way the second pen should have been given; and how come VAR wasn't used for the 3rd goal - offside? And I'm a Chelsea follower.
The first penalty had minimal contact ,although there was some form of contact making it eligible for a penalty. Although Werner arguably made a meal out of it. The second penalty is undisputedly a disgrace. There's nothing he can do, he had already blocked it with his foot meaning it was no longer on target towards the goal and his arm is in a completely natural position. Even if the ball was on target towards goal and his hand was in an unnatural position it is greatly unfair toybook him for a clear and obvious unintentional hand ball. This is what VAR is for. Do better
Miles better without all that piped crowd noise.
These commentators make the game even more boring 😴
Chelsea play better progressive football than United, hence why Lampard gets less critiscm than Ollie,
Chelsea are peforming really well right now with the new signings.
Obscene decision that is never a penalty and absolutely never a booking. 2 deflections before it hit is arm that is criminal.
Commentators: Darren Fletcher Glenn Hoddle
As a Chelsea fan I was very troubled by the second penalty decision
Why Camavinga Not Playing?????
Ref killed the game.
No way a pen
Football is dead.
The referees comprehension of  what’s a deliberate handball and not is so poor. Embarrassing for his employers.
Imagine to pay 50 mil to vhange the penalty taker😂😂
Never a second yellow
Nice to see Abramovich dolling his bribes out to refs again
Anyone done stats on how many games with the score containing 3 Chelsea have had?
the handball rules are a joke, and to get a red as well - just ridiculous
As a Chelsea fan that player was very unlucky to have the 2nd penalty against him
We all love VAR when it goes our way.
Joke Ref, KILLED THE GAME
I am a Chelsea supporter, no way on earth that penalty should have been given. It hits his chest, nowhere near his arm. That decision completely ruined the game.
what a pass from reece james assisting abraham
Can we just take a moment to appreciate that turn run and pass by mason mount before he got hit to start up the attack💫 class
Well jorginhos out of my fantasy team
How much was Edouard Mandy
4:11 what a pass 😍
Wait we're unbeaten in 10 matches in all comps?
More evidence of poor refereeing
Chelsea
As a Chelsea fan the second pen shouldn’t have happened and was not a second yellow
I am happy that even Chelsea fans are admitting it wasn't a second yellow
That’s not a pen. Dissapointing by the ref
Chelsea can win the premier league come on
And there was everyone questioning lampard as manager 5 clean sheets in a row
Honestly these handball shouts are killing the game. Football is becoming hard to watch!
Chelsea fan, love seeing this squad starting to click but I think the second pen was very harsh, hit his foot, how cld he have know it wld have gone up to his hand
Var is a joke there was nothing that boy could do with that 2nd hand ball,It literally hit of his leg and hit his Arm lol
I could maybe understand it being a penalty but not a 2nd yellow he didnt know it was going to hit his arm. These "laws" need to be looked at because football is turning into a circus
Mendy makes goal keeping look way too easy😂
Frank out
That attempted goal by Ziyech would be sensational if scored. (First attempt)
That penalty...
Red card, no way. How could he avoid the ball hitting his arm. Use common sense ref.
I'm a chelsea fan and that wasn't a penalty or red card come on ref
Man Chelsea is still taking this "3" sponsorship seriously.
That 3rd goal was like a Man City goal👏 Chelsea taking shape now
I just seen him being world class in champions league and even Ajax directors said he’s the real deal,he’s the real deal.Hakim
Surely both penalties should’ve been retaken as jorginho entered the box before he kicked it both times ?
Anybody defending that sending off for handball is a moron who knows nothing about football, it's laws and common sense.
Penalty decisions are now just absolutely disgraceful. A point blank shot that hit his leg and deflected upwards how can that possibly warrant a penalty?? Wtf he actually got sent off for it too?! Rip football
6 clean sheets
Frank doing well so far at Chelsea 😊
Werner 🔥🔥🔥
Shame there manger not good enough rip frank
Penalty I agree with but to give that second yellow just doesn't feel right
Mendy is the real deal!
We take our sponsorship with 3 to all levels
Yooo
If Chelsea actually finish 3rd ad average 3 goals this season. Then next season they have to get 1 plus Nord as a sponsor😂
No Jorginho taking penalties any more? Thank goodness for that. He looked like if he were trying to teach my 7 year old daughter how to skip a rope.
That first pen was no way a pen, that was a clear dive.
2:10 looks like chelsea is loved by the ref here
Can we just start Giroud over Tammy ffs.
Never a penalty. Disgraceful decision!
It feels like and empty victory winning in the most part due to terrible refereeing. If the decisions given had of been against Chelsea I for one would be fuming. I think we were the better team but 3-0 ... 2 penalties and a red card just don’t feel right. All that being said I think we are starting to look more solid at the back and the new additions are playing with freedom. I end on this another win another clean sheet let’s not get ahead of ourselves and let’s see where we are at against some big opposition. I look forward to it. Win lose or draw I’m Chels!
It's pen-ner
People complaining about VAR. Nah VAR has just shown how bad referees are at there job
2nd penalty & red card 🤭👎 I need a finger wag emoji 🙄
Why do refs feel the need to ruin games
That second yellow was BULLSHIT
Mendy has to be on some typa drugs😂😂😂
Werner gonna turn into a pen merchant
Thought that was stormzy in the Rennes goal for a second spit n double
That red card was extremely harsh
All things considered, I'm getting mighty impressed with our defence these days, I mean this is the 5th or 6th clean sheet on a bounce, may it long continue!
I agree with many on here, that red card and second pen was harsh. But that's the kind of rules UEFA and FIFA have gone with, bloody morons.
Today, Chelsea FC did not play well. He had only luck with a player with a red card problem who did not play good football because he forgot Tiki Taka to decipher the Rennes club code. But if he focused on player No. 22, the play would have been open and full of surprise because Zieych is the king of Assist in the Netherlands.
The ref was in on it
Werner is looking like penaldo
I swear the second went off the chest?
Didn’t Rennes offside goal hit James on the way so isn’t that onside?
When did KSI start playing for Chelsea??
chelsea’s football in that second half...
Chelsea plodding along nicely. Still think they needed a striker though.
Pener back in action
Who said black keepers can't keep goal, must have been the same guy who said "white men can't jump", lol!
That second penalty and the red card both absolutely ridiculous. How's he meant to stop that hitting his arm?
Embarrassing call from the ref on the second pen. If I was a Rennes supporter I’d be livid. Would never have happened in a full stadium
Everyone's stealing Liverpool's play.
A defender standing in his own penalty box puts both hands in the air in order to do what exactly?  Whilst his arms are in that unnatural position for a Defender he manages to block a shot and its NOT a deliberate foul, yellow card and penalty?  When did it become part of football that a Defender could block a shot with his arms or hands?  I'd see the point if the ball had hit the Defender's hands  whilst down  by his side and NOT in the air. The  Chelsea players had NO hesitation in claiming a penalty and quite right too.  If that players arms had been down by his side and NOT in the air then there wouldn't've been a penalty and second yellow card.
Chelsea got lucky.
Horrific refereeing. No second pen and no red.
Great second penalty.
Hate to say it as he’s just come to Chelsea, but ziyech is overrated imo 🤷‍♂️
How can that ref give a pen for a ball than originally hits the players legs then naturally travels up onto his arm. Then the cheek to send him off. Crazy Stuff.
Whatever happened to the troll called “amitabh Bachchan” he was the original John Abraham.
Chelsea fan here, scoring that pen and the red card felt horrible to watch. I would have much rather it stayed 1-0 against 10 men at that point
If it didn’t hit his hand, that would have smashed him clean in the face. How the f is that a pen? And a second yellow? These rules are killing the game
2020 is dalbert in a nutshell.
Werner is all about penalties. And chelsea fans criticize bruno.
These Panalties are simple destroying football . . . . VAR was meant to enhance the football experience and answer all the questions, but instead it has left us with more questions and a bitter taste in our mouths.
Werner oooo ooo
Can't send someone off for that!? Utter rubbish
Chelsea are definitely getting into their stride, still lots to do though.
💎
penaltyball, more goals scored through penalys than normal its a joke
Love to see Chelsea vs Barcelona... Chelsea 3-0 Barcelona....🤣😅😆😂🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭
Half hearted win in my opinion
3 is the best way to win ....🤣😅😆😂
Liverpooooooool
These refs do not understand the game, have they never played football in their life? the decision for that pen and red card can only come from a person that has not played the game.  Reading the rules from books ain’t the only answer
The English teams are so weak:( On the other hand, the German ones are very strong!
💚❤ Lampard has improved with formation
Hakim Ziyech is looking like chelseas best buy this season imo
Chelsea and Liverpool have only had clean sheets in every game in the UCL
Rennes really replaced Mendy with Stormzy
I’m gassed right now we need to try win against bigger teams now these teams r too easy for Chelsea
Absolutely Shocking
Never a pen 🤣🤣
Platini was always right: VAR is killing football
Mendy is the number 1 goalkeeper in the world, having captured 6 games without conceding
vay aq bi takim boyle dogranir
will jorginho take pen in prem or not?
whats sad is that even with VAR, the ref managed to call that a red card
Good that Werner takes pennies now instead of Jorginho. Jorginho is a good player but it's unfair how Werner won all the pennies he scored this season yet couldn't take any of em.
Chelsea really taking the 3 sponsorship seriously
That should have never been a second yellow
Bro it’s a bit mad that on fifa kepa is an 82 and many is only a 79😂
How can he watch VAR and decide thats a penalty and even an yellow... Did he think that was intentional??
Don’t forget or under rate Tammy Abraham he will go on to be a world class stricker
That left back had an absolute mare today 🤣
Most of us Chelsea fans feel bad for such red card. I mean of course I am fine with the win and nothing else but the way referee are using the VAR is killing the game we all love.
Where are the other games! We don't only want to see English teams!!
Stupid ref. Soft first challenge never a yellow. Second one never a yellow he knew nothing about that deflection
Awful pen and sending off. Ref is nuts.
Something wrong with 3😂😂😂
Mendy is a beasttttttt
That second penalty and second yellow card is a complete joke, wtf is the game coming to, what was the defender supposed to do?
Even as a Chelsea fan that 2nd penalty decision was so bad
That referee should not be allowed to referee in the champions league AGAIN, his decision to give Chelsea a second penalty and then to send off the player, was scandalous.   I think Chelsea would have won the game, even without the appalling referee decisions.
The red card wasn’t fair shouldn’t have been a penalty tbh
That was a harsh red
That arm role is stupid
Maybe a penalty (i think so, his arms were in an unnatural position) but definitely not a second yellow. If anything, its an accident, thats it
Blues 🔵🔵
Feel sorry for kepa🤕
1st penalty wasnt a penalty.. not every tackle in box is a foul and with the second one.. give the penalty yes but dont give the player a red card.. ref is a crackhead
I'm an arsenal fan and I am in love with the way reece James plays
That’s not a red card that was really harsh
This match was bollocks, Rennes got screwed over.
Did Chelsea buy the red that second pen was bs yes it hit his hand but also hit his chest so his arm that touched it was in
The second one wasn’t a pen. Very unfair.
I’m a Chelsea fan I didn’t think he deserved a yellow for the first tackle on Werner
Imagine ziyech scoring that volley Omd
What kind of penalty decision was that? And a red? Seriously?
As a Chelsea fan that is never a pen or a yellow
As a Chelsea fan, no pen. But certainly no yellow, they need to address var
The referee has to be suspended for that  decision.
5:10 perfectly in sync
P H A T D I V E by WERNER!
Finally our left position is strong what a player chillwell
Noo Kai Havertz has Corona 😭😭☹☹
VAR is an absolute joke football was such a better place when it wasn’t around
2:35 stormzy needs to work on his set piece keeping
That second yellow was ridiculous
How’s the 2nd one a pen?
werner should be pen taker from now on, no more hop skip jump
that’s disgusting officiating
RIP Football.
second pen was bs and I'm a chelsea fan
Feel sorry for Dalbert and Rennes. That was never a red card or a penalty. Good performance from Chelsea tho.
This match was a bit of a cheat
Who thinks Mendy has done a great job for Chelsea since he joined them❤👏
Mendy could save the dinosaurs from extinction
That pen is such a bad call it was deflected of his opposite hand and was going out after the deflection
Tammy or timo 👇
MASSIVE RESULT
Harsh red by anyone’s standards
The rule with hand ball know is if it hit the arm wither it intentional or not it a hand ball
Awful penalty call but then to give a second yellow is a effin disgrace!! Football is becoming a joke.
4:33 Renees goalie to ball: y u do this?
Shocking ref
No common sense applied there. Shocking decision. The games gone.
Another clean sheet for mendy
Love how Rennes have Stormzy as their Goal keeper
All games are being fixed to keep the fans watching.
How does a trash team like chelsea win 3-0?
I don't think it was a penalty 1:56  or second yellow card . The ball deflected from his foot into his arm
I’m slowly losing faith in the rules of football 😔
Mendy cost 3x less than havertz, but is proving to be about 3x better
As in fully ready cause they have been winning their champions league matches.
Disgrace of a rule. 2nd yellow for that hand ball is a joke. If that’s the rules then change the rules. Absolute joke that
reece james dosent get enough praise
The way Chelsea is playing seems as if they are ready to win the champions league this season
Perner
That second yellow was ridiculous
VAR and the ref think that’s a pen 🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈 All we can do is laugh it’s that ridiculous!
Cheats
Jota > Werner
Chelsea will win the champions league
Chelsea are a bunch of cheating gits
That pen age red card was ridiculous but even still, Chelsea are looking class
The hand ball given  actually destroys the nature of the game...so sad!
Fam Mendy has kept more clean sheets than kepa in all competitions this season
Terrible ref Wish cama wasn’t injured
What happened to brought to hand? Stupid decision
Another clean sheet for mendy My G on FIRE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That keeper is soooooo suspect??!
Now Jorginho is never going to score a goal, penalties were his only hope 😒
That was an embarrassing penalty and sending off decision from the referee.
Werner took Jorginho off penalties 😂
Mendy has been our most important signing we look so much calmer in defense and make less mistakes
That ref needs sent to the wall!
That's not handball.... how the hell could he get his hands out the way that quick
The referee needs punished for that display.
F*ck me. How in the world was that a penalty and red card?
Mendy has yet another clean sheet. This chelsea squad is beginning to look like the business
Kurt zouma got kicked in the chocolate starfish
we didn’t deserve this and i’m a chelsea fan
AGAIN 3-0
Zouma kovacic weren’t yellows mendy picked up a back pass and Jorginho should’ve received a red
Even as a Chelsea fan that was a shocking red card very unfortunate
Olé out
How was that last goal offside it came off James?
That second penalty was ridiculous. The ball would have hit his torso if his arms were at his sides anyway.
another clean sheet for mendy, what a signing so far💪💪
VAR strikes again
the people behind the scenes, who are never named and shamed, who foisted this ludicrous law on our beautiful game, so that a handball like that deserves a penalty and a card should be kicked out of football.
I stopped watching after the red card
Chelsea's 3 Sponsorship is getting out of hand now!
Even as a chelsea fan. That second penalty and sending off was a farce
Wtf Ref
Ref took this piss, wasn’t even a handball let alone a yellow card for a completely accidental hand ball 😂
Where the 3 memes when we win? Ahahahaha sym
That ref is having a joke with that VAR assisted decision.
First penalty was one of the softest I've ever seen. Second was was unlucky to concede, but correct.  Third goal though.. 😍
That second penalty is a joke and to send the poor lad off for it as well, if that’s a penalty then the Cl is gone just like the Pl 🙄
Football is finished.
I’m actually a Roman reigns fan but for some reason Rennes vs Chelsea came up on my feed. Well done 👏 Chelsea good win
Interesting Timo has taken over pens
I'm a Chelsea fan and that was never a penalty let alone a second yellow!
Edouard Mendy with another clean sheet!!!
I am in awe as to how that’s a handball, and also a yellow card. Referees are ruining football, in all competitions.
What is that red card ?
I'm a chelsea fan but that was never a red card but I dont think it effected the outcome anyways
That second penalty is absolutely ridiculous
Poor refereeing I am a Chelsea fan and that made no sense. Even if the ball was to miss his hand the ball would’ve gone for the corner. My brothers sunday league ref would’ve done better.
Sack the refs that’s disgraceful
Honestly as a Chelsea fan I felt so bad because that was not a penalty (the second one) let alone the red card
That ref is slow in the head eveb wuth the reolay he still gave that yeah and sent him off?? Suspend this fool
5 clean sheets!!!
Up the chels 💙💙💙
Im a Chelsea supporter but that second penalty was rediculous. VAR ruining the game.
Referee must’ve been drunk to give the 2nd penalty, even after a VAR check oh my goodness 🤦‍♂️
Deflected off his own teammate onto his arm...at speed and close distance, and the ref had the balls to give him a yellow for that. We don't need refs like that in the Champions League.
Mendy knows Rennes very much 🤣🤣
Another great win!! COYB
Love how Abraham said *my boy* to James after that brilliant cross💙💙
yes
I just feel so bad for that defender
This chelsea team is brilliant. Respect to the club
Mendy has beaten Petr Cech's record of consecutive clean sheets in his first 6 matches
3 ...
Chelsea:Over the moon after a clean sheet   Arsenal’s Defense:Look at our record
Haaland sleeps with his motm footballs  Mendy sleeps with clean sheets
Imagine if Chelsea were sponsored by 5g network. Goals galore 🙌🏻
Omg we didn’t have to wait ages for bt to upload a champions league highlights video
I’m a Chelsea fan and the 2nd one was a pen but wasn’t a red for sure
Another game where Chelsea have been loyal to their 3 sponsor !!
The 3 sponsorship is still alive guys
If thats a penalty snd a yellow then football is in the dust (sub to my channel)
Clean sheet on top of clean sheets!
Chelsea are taking the Three sponsorship way too seriously now
Perner
How is the second penalty a second yellow card, wasn’t even a pen
This three sponsor is getting a bit silly now
Not a red card there at all pen at least but not a red
2:33 Stormzy?
How tf is that a yellow lol😂😂😂😂
Come on boys 🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵
I wonder after tonight's display in Germany if PSG are regretting letting Silva go. His defending is Flawless
Werner is machine his work rate 🙌
Chelsea did not disappoint tonight
Mendy has 5 clean sheets in a row. The last time a Chelsea keeper achieved this it was 10 years ago 😎
Two awful penalty desicions
Even as a Chelsea fan that red card felt bad
Like for Chelsea to win the Champions League
My uncle is a man u fan, the other night  i told him that we beat krasnodar 4-0 and he said, its a pub team and anyone could beat them, that really back fired to the pub team they played tonight😂
That was never a red there was nothing he could do there wtf
Timo werner motm mendy keeps his 6th cleansheet of the season Tammy Abraham scores his 3rd goal of the season 👏👏
Werner the new penandes
Chelsea finally👊🤩👀💪
Chelsea’s defence went to one of the best to one of the worst
Why’d they make ziyechs if card rw man🤦‍♂️
Is it not ball to hand?
Someone give this 👑 to Frank, I think he dropped it
Rip football
Mendy is the new Petr Čech
We are now seeing rb Leipzig Werner at Chelsea   He is in form
Waiting for Irish guy to pour ice over his head
Even as a Chelsea fan Imo I think that was never a pen or a red... Var is running football
YES CMON CHELSEA
Cheez I wasn’t this quick since Chris do four Mil nerf war
Haha then they say Timo was a flop 🤣
Benson called it!
No one can chat about PeNcHeStEr and VaRcHeStEr again
I'm calling it now Ziyech is gonna flop.
TAAAMMMMYYYYY
Man united are a joke of a club
Mendy has more clean sheets in the prem than Martial has shots on target(0) this season 😬😬😬
Chelsea are the best team in the world at the moment on current form......
Chelsea,Liverpool and city cruising in group stage and representing England proud  Then there’s United
Gg rennes love their fighting spirit despite that red card
Chelsea can go far in the champions league if they stay injury free and don’t start leaking in goals. COYB 💙
Gotta love Chelsea for taking their sponsor seriously
Another clean sheet I’m an arsenal fan but this is great from Mendy 👏
🙌
First and foremost Get well Soon Kai
Chelsea are getting better and man Utd are getting worse. everything back to normal
WE HAVE THE NEW PENALTY MERCHANT LADIES AND GENTS, FORGET PENANDES , PERNER HAS WOKEN
Imagine conceding goals Can never be my club
Ziyech is an amazing playmaker. He has an expected of 1 assists every 2.5 games. The highest since fabregas
solid performance lads but def not a 2nd pen
Early?

Mad what a good goalkeeper can do to a club
