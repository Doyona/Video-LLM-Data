Trying really hard to poop more often ☹️
"you made that over there-" I can't 😂
Does this prove there are girls in the ryanverse
So wait. How were they born🧱
Tab A, Slot B, now you have a Mini Me!
This has to be Adam and Eve's exact reaction
"I'll try" is my favourite line.
Ryan you are not the biological male component used to create this person.
Yep child support is the next thing for sure
1:06 Thanks for trying French 🇫🇷! “Excusez-moi !  Arrêtez, s’il vous-plaît !”
Coming soon: the world's first paternity test!
So is this Adam and Eve
I can't say I haven't try that myself!! 🙄
Pretty good, but Christopher Atkins and Brooke Shields already did this bit 45 years ago.
What if Adam & Eve had a baby?
Adam and eve😂
"Good luck with that." lol I was waiting for him to say that.
Pitch greeting.  Tongued cheeky.
Ryan’s costumes are getting way too good
Barely an...  no, this basically ruins your entire life as you knew it.
Oh wow wow wow   Wow
Then how were Ryan and Julie born?
0:00 Every Npc idle animation ever
Fun fact: Ryan George and Julie Nolke are the same person.
We got a video of Adam and Eve fighting way back in the day before GTA 6
I can imagine that this is exactly how Adam and Eve reacted when they had Cain.
*First Couple To Have A Baby*  Me: So it’s basically just Adam and Eve
Great work ppl.
I love y'alls sense of humour!
Second half of this is basically a word for word rendition of what my bio-dad  said to my mother one day 36 years ago (unconfirmed, but I'm probably right)
Adam and Eve
Ryaaaaaaan!!!!
For myself I felt betrayed that I went through so much pain giving birth. (I got to the hospital too late for the epidural.) only to find out that when my milk came in that also hurts and none of the parenting books warned me that that would hurt so bad! Your boobs hurt like pins and needles especially the first week and your entire boob aches and feels heavy like bricks.
If you told me the thumbnail was a before and after transition photo, I would believe you. I legit expected him crossdressing 😭
No no no
So these two are basically Adam and Eve and this baby is cain that makes way too much sense
😂😂😂
Yeah I just watched this for producer guy
Hmm, Adam and Eve are different than I imagined
mommy LOL
ew!
Wowowowowowowowowow
His name was Cain. If that doesn't tell you everything you need to know.
1:31 - ha "diapers" - what a bunch of bollock - it is definitelly called a "poop catcher" I decided 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
lol, congrats
Ryan's baby is my nightmare fuel.
One of my favorite movies: Children of Men - (2006)
Having a kid is super difficult. It's really an inconvenience.
I would imagine at some point the history of the human race, humans didn't know what caused a baby.  They had them, but didn't know why.
Love a Ryan George and Julie Nolke rewatch.
"That seems like a lot.  I poop once a week."  Threw me a bit.
Wait a second, when Eve had a child, what did she think it was?
Ryan had a real life baby with princess Jasmine
Burrito leads to pregnancy, consume at your own risk
it's pretty funny how this vid was only a little while before either of them had kids and now both of them have kids lol
Chocolate can have psychoactive effects on the body, including mood changes, cravings, and addiction-like responses. These effects are attributed to the alkaloids in chocolate, such as theobromine, phenethylamine, and caffeine, which can affect serotonin in the brain and trigger the release of chemicals that make people feel good.
I love how this single sketch implies people with dwarfism exist, different languages exist, flipping MARRIAGE exists yet these two are part of the first and only generation on the planet.
"it DOES look pretty dumb"
More than once a week?!?!? what do you doo all day?
Congratulations for the baby
It's so funny they made this video two years ago and now Ryan and Julie both have real babies of their own! 👍😃 Congratulations to both of you!
why would the FIRST guess be that it came out of her and not that she found it? When i go up to someone and show him something, they have never ever asked me if that came out of me. Usually they ask "what is that?" or "where did you find that?"  also, how did he know it didnt have teeth?
Bloodthirsty Ryan BabyKid made a cameo!
not cursed child ryan please not that again never that again
The baby's face! Omg! 😂😂😂😂😂
did you do a collab with the adstronaut?
I was not ready for baby Ryan
Literally Adam and Eve
Adam and eve...
adam and eve in a nutshell
The real question here is how tf do they exist Like at all Like did they just spawn in without going through childhood
Cannibal child : the origins
1:45 Not ME here actually pooping about once every 10 days (by my own estimate) 😭😭😂😂  (Jit called me out 💀💀💀💀)
"I don't remember being that small" 🤣
They made our day :) and a baby
These folks don't resemble early eukaryote to me at all so I believe there is false information in this content.
It's a good joke here, but the amount of men who leave women to become single moms and avoid all sort of responsibility is sickening. Paying child support is the bare minimum and most men fail to even do that!
Wow you have more than one channel 😊
"I've had better"  - Jim Carey
I thought I’d never have to see Ryan’s beautiful baby boy again, but here we are.
So does this mean these are the only 2 people on earth till they were the 1st to have a kid? Lmao 😂
😂😂😂😂
I think it's a great skit and my original post accidentally got deleted so...
I don't see any reason to criticize comedy based on any real world expectations or experiences, but we're not dumb. Who would actually think that this is serious attempt to give parenting advice...? Oh, they do?? 😮
Impregnating Julia Nolke was super easy, barely an inconvenience.
I never thought I would hear Ryan George speak in a Quebec accent. I never even knew he was from Quebec.
"Having babies is tight!"   "No, It's not anymore.."
Vasectomies
😆😂😆
“… you should poop more often.  Try eating the fruit “
How did they get Born
Excusez-moi, arrêtez s’il vous plaît 😂😂😂😂
This makes no sense for a FIRST COUPLE to do this, if there are other couples who gave birth to them
Hey! He's that guy from the thing I like!
I forgot how amazing Ryan was at being a baby.
"Good luck with that!" Classic.
Woah that French was good
Adam and Eve💀
2:17 dear God
Barely an inconvenience
0:28 the way they act indifferent 😅
They discovered an early conversation of Adam and Eve
*looks at her belly* "you're getting fat"
You can't prove anything 😂🤔☝️📜👈💯🙏 don't bring a child into this horrible world because we don't live in the 70s, 08s or 90s😺🤠🪓
Ryan: So you got another baby for me? Wife: Yes sir I do.
Congrats on the actual baby tho
The quick cut to the Ryan-baby is pure nightmare fuel. Thank you.
*Awee* *making da Baby!* 0:58  😂😂 _One could say it was super easy, barely an inconvenience!_
Imagining this conversation between adam and eve
We should totally get another one of these!
RYAAAAAAM YOU DIDIDITITT YESSS FINALLY GESSYESYESYESYESYES
Love the implication that either Ryan heard her screaming and whatnot from the pain of giving birth in the other room and just didn't do anything, or Julie just spent the whole birthing process calmly going "Ow. What? Oh, I think something is coming out of me. Ouch. Ok, Im pretty sure this isn't supposed to be ha- Ow."
So,you have a baby for me...
More Ryan baby content 😂😂😂
"I'll try"
I am confused by the presence of the non -Ryan person.
Wtf is Ryan québécois lol
Lmao, I didn't even notice that the video was not on Ryan his yt channel. Until the ending, obviously.
Democrats still don’t understand that babies are people, even today.
Ryan George is bringing old school YouTube skits back!!
You guys should make a serious simply titled if life was logical.
Baby George... Thanks for the nightmares bruh
Even when your expecting to see Baby Ryan, you're still not ready for that.
0:54 -0:57 made me laugh
If they're the first couple to have a baby, then that makes it the first baby, which means the couple were never babies, which means...... no bellybuttons
I poop 4 to 5 times a day
Hi Dr. Therapist, yeah it's me again. Yeah, I saw the baby again.
Sid is having a baby awww so cute 😊
I would have expected the first couple to have a baby exist in like ancient times.
"People make...uh...little people? .... Children! I loss the word there. Ha ha."
Yeah no yeah .. i get that 😂
This is actually brilliant, " hes obsessed with my nipples " yeah same i get that , respect little man 😂😂😂😂😂
So, have you two hooked up?
I dont know which problem to focus on first here? 😆
Ryan really should have played the woman in a wig and a dress 😂😂😂
How tf do they exist tho
Damn, Ryan really has a good french pronunciation ! Those Rs aree absolutely perfect !
way too short. lift your game
Better fake baby than American sniper
AS A NATIVE FRENCH SPEAKER, I CAN SAY THIS IS VERY ACCURATE FRENCH ACCENT OMG.
Been there
You can't prove anything 😼
You should be pooping more “I’ll try”
So does this mean Julie's real baby has a big brother?
Your french really sound like here in Quebec
Noioojsbehrehshsb not baby Ryan
You should be pooping more
THE BABY FACE💀😂
it's definitely the teeth
The “Stop it” line when the baby started crying hit way to close to home
Why do I feel like that baby wants to pitch me a script 🤔
> "Was it hard?" Not at all, barely an inconvenience.
The cgi Ryan George baby is at least not as freky as the baby Arnold Schwarzenegger from Junior
btw did Julie jinx herself with this
Wait, how were they born then
Dear IRS.  I didn't 100% identify with this at all.  Don't even worry about my records.
u mean adam and eve?
This isn’t the first couple. Instincts to rear children evolved when mammals evolved and no longer laid eggs. But glad they discovered diapers❤❤❤
Adam and eve be like:
This video is old but hilarious.
Goodluck with that :D
I don’t think that’s how it went wit Adam and Eve 😂
It has a beard
“It’s French”  “It pooped on me”  “Oh! Maybe it’s German”-(what I wish they said😂)
Julie knew that Ryan was the father when the baby's first words were "Hi there!  Hello!  I'm a fricken' baby!  Give me food!"
Your child is a pineapple which lives primarily one one single green leaf of one of 7 varieties every 62 minutes. Prove me wrong.
U can't prove that lol
You should be pooping more than once a week?
1:09 you just spoke nearly word-perfect canadian french. That threw off guard.
how is your mirror self doing?
Man: You threw up. Mostly in the morning... Woman: No it was all day... Man: Yeah mostly in the mornings. I'm gonna call that your morning sickness... Me: subtle.
"A dumb wrinkly potato I would die for." Checks out.
If their the first couple to have a baby where did they come from?
I got in a loop watching the both videos and it's recommendations.please help
More often? lol you'd die if you pooped multiple times in a single week.
I like to imagine this is what adam and eve thought
Poop catcher sounds WAY BETTER than nappies/diapers!! 😀 lol.
How did she get the subscribe button to glow rainbow-colored when she said to subscribe?
Adam and Eve
aliens trying to take care of a human  baby 👽👽👶
Should have waited a bit
Respect!!
Well, I can see why she wanted the divorce.
Dammit, I had just gotten over baby Ryan in therapy!
I was NOT ready for that face REVEAL!!!!!!!!!!¡ 🤣 lol! ❤
Ah so this is the origin of that horrible kid
2:18 what is that?
Can’t believe this was a year ago.. you sure really were planning a baby weren’t you
First couple to get a paternity test next
When I saw Ryan sitting there, first thing I thought was, Mirror Julie's looking at him...
A good call on the irresponsible father, but I think it would be funnier if both wanted to take care of the baby but were the first people to do it.
That baby is hideous
the first guy to look for the milk
His coloring skills has his visual quality. If that makes any sense has gotten a lot better you could tell Liz might’ve been one of his first ones of this type and he didn’t quite know how to get the comedy style in the coloring down. You’ve gotten even better my man you’ve gotten even better.
Oh my God! You guys did have a kid! You guys are divarication. I mean, I know he was the first guy to take a vacation, but you took both would be the first couple / family... 😁😁
So………BASICALLY, it’s Adam and Eve……..… giving birth to Cane/Able………….? lol ❤
SOOOOO  Good   SOOOO  funny
His portrayal of the father hurt that was too real no I don't like that it makes me hate men again no no please no why do any men be like that 😭 its evil
Never going to be able to unsee that image of baby Ryan
So that's what women look like in the Ryanverse.  I would have thought that they looked like Ryan George, complete with beard and wig.    Huh, I guess you really do learn something new every day.
And so the nightmare came to be.
Baby Ryan is the worst thing i’ve ever seen
Adam and Eve be like
Adam and Eve?
2:18 Okay... That's cursed. I think it may be a demon
Love this 😂♥
This could have been Adam and Eve's first conversation about Cain... sort of anyways... minus Adam speaking French.
Joke at the end about not being able to prove anything sucked.
"excusez Moi, arrêtez, s'il-vous-plaît !" 😂😂😂
As a parent of four, this was frikn awesome
The “morning” sickness bit was so relatable. We need a new name for it 😅
"Excusez-moi, arrêtez s'il-vous-plaît."  *poop*  "There you go. Super easy. Barely an inconvenience."
Opening line should be "Something looks different about you, I don't know, have you maybe lost weight and also gained a tiny friend?"
Now I know why they were terrified of the baby.
The way he talks over her with morning sickness encompasses how women are treated overall. 😂
When comedians TRY to be funny....
Given the premise in the title this has some serious religious implications
So... is future Julie going to pop up and have a chat with these two?
Babies are disgusting! We need retroactive abortion...
Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk 😂😂😂
"you should be pooping more" don't call me out XD
And now Julie has a baby on the way for real 😊
"So...that burrito you had 9 months ago..."
I LOVE THESE VIDEOS 🤣
"you can't prove anything, it's impossible" "Actually it's going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience!" "Oh, really?" "You see, this thing is the spitting image of you and since I don't look anything like you, there you go, it's half yours"
Questions.                            How
Isn't that just adam and eve
I can't hear anything
I think you should have more vids together lol 🇨🇦
0:51 “Its obsessed with my nipples for some reason” “I get that” “No it’s like eating my boobs” “Can’t say I haven’t tried that myself. Respect”😂😂😂😂
the baby 😂😂😂😂
Hopefully this isn’t considered an ignorant question: is this the woman that Ryan recently married in the real universe? I’m not up to date on all my-cool kid YouTube gossip
A dumb, wrinkly potato lol
SO, YOU HAVE A NEW BABY FOR ME?
Little did you know that this was a acually a fortunetelling video
hey wait it's that guy
BLOOD Baby - The origin story
I get it, but I don't get it.  My mind has trouble understanding this as a concept, because you know, humans have been producing babies since they became human, and even before that.  So funny, but absurd.
a lil comment
respect
He is a real life father?
ADAM AND EVE
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Throw it
Having babies is TIGHT!
Unexpectedly brilliant social commentary!
This is even more funny now that she is pregnant !
I believe firmly this happened when Cain was born
Now this is a reality for Julie 😂
The only part I can relate to is pooping once a week
I imagine this is probably the next 10 years or so when everyone in their reproductive age range is trans or non-binary or somewhere in a spectrum, and mutilated their sexual organs in gender affirming care, they've forgotten how to reproduce or where babies come from. Or they want freedom so much that they regularly take morning after or abortion pills every day as a routine and forget why they take it.
that's what all babies look like in the ryan verse
Wow, wowowow.   Wow.
I hope they colab again now that she's expecting.
I like to imagine how society worked before this…
Why does Beardless Ryan's face look so different? Like, he looks really different as Beardless Ryan.
TmIt looks like a cannibal baby.
Ohh having kids is tight, barely an inconvenience, wow wow wow, Wow!
First baby French and English already exist. The lore of this Universe is mind boggling.
What is with ryan just casually speaking perfect french?
Yo adam and eve mad respect to you i didnt know it was like that
Omg kill it with fire lol
I’ve thought about this quite a bit, Adam and Eve were the first people to ever have had a baby but they were never children themselves, so they really had to wing it
LOL
It's weird how the first time you hold your baby, well in my case babies, you get that feeling of lifetime commitment. Fun fact a babies first poo is green and is pretty much odor free. The nice thing about hospital we had our twins at is the nurses will absolutely make sure you don't sleep while you are there. If you do by some miracle find 5-10 minutes of time between feedings and changing diapers and worry to pass out from exhaustion a nurse will come and loudly ask how everyone is doing to make sure that either you or the babies wake up so the sleep thing doesn't happen. I thought that was a really nice touch especially since we were in the hospital for 4.5 days. Helped me set a new personal best for time gone without sleeping. It's also really nice that they totally hunt you down and make sure you pay your giant bill that insurance doesn't cover before you leave as well. So many amenities.
I wish you and ryan could collab more they're always 🔥 🔥
Ryan has the ability of making anything hilarious like how in the beginning of the sketch he’s just casually sitting on the bed, it’s like comedy for him is super easy, barely an inconvenience 😂 👍🏽
LOL you and Ryan are awesome together. More please.
Babies are genetically less-than-half the father, even more-so if they're male. The Mom provides 100% the mitochondrial DNA, and the Y-chromosome is substantially smaller than the X-chromosome.
Matryoshka!
And Julie is now actually pregnant. Suspicious
So are there multiple of her in the Ryan Georgeverse too? Or is it all Ryans and just one Julie? My working theory is that universe was created by a poorly worded wish or possibly Ryan George Prime became a mad god or something
Now she is having da baby
Why don't you and Ryan, get together write a romantic comedy, shoot and star in it? That would be awesome.  Then right after it comes out, Ryan can cover it on his Pitch Meeting channel
lol.. you guys do suc great work. The schtick never gets old. Keep em coming :)
Ryan, you look really hot as a woman 😮
Am I the only one picturing Adam and Eve?
Ryan mentioning how “it does look pretty dumb” whilst gesturing to his face is a reference to his very punchable face he has eluded to in other videos.
"Gross, why did you do that?" i could not agree more.
My headcanon about your first person to do blank is what happened if Thanos succeeded in Endgame and erased and brought back half of the universe
I had to come back and watch this after your pregnancy announcement. This is so funny now. Between this and the weiner that changed my life skit, you were foreshadowing hard. Congrats and I hope everything goes well for you. I love your content.
Hmm, how well did this age 10 months later ?   ;-)
good one !
I so didn't know there was a part 3.  Screw you, YouTube algorithm
Hiss French is perfect. He seems to be from Quebec.
I am 100% pooping as I watch this
9 months ago!
Guys we're watching adam and eve
foreshadowing
And now it's really happening! So happy for you and Ryan! And if you cheated on Ryan, go to *ell!!! J/K Congratulations!
Uncanny that this video was 9 months before the pregnancy announcement video. 🤣🤣
First Couple To Have A Baby; May 2022 - NINE MONTHS AGO. Coincidence? I aren't think so!
I love the nonsense of this "firsts to ever" videos. Like, first couple to have a baby, and yet they're both... Humans. Unless Adam and Eve had a very modern apartment and clothes, I'm calling that bs
I’m watching this 9 months after it was posted. Dang burritos
2:18 THE BABY RYAN HAS RETURNED FOR MORE BLOOD
"Blood:)" -da baby
"You can't prove anything."
Oh no he lives again 2:17
First guy to get an abortion
Surprised when there wasn't two Ryan's talking to each other hah
First woman to have a period?
Woah wtf Ryan are you secretly Quebecois ? Your french sounded authentic brah. Barely an inconvenience!
😂😂😂😂😂
The first couple to have a baby has a fully furnished room in a home? R they also the first couple to ever build a home…n create furniture…create a painting as a decoration…invented DOOR KNOBS!?
Julie Nolke, YOU are the greatest online, P E R I O D!   I COULD have just used an actual period but the point would've been muted. Thanks for the laugh.  Bo
Not a fan of this or any of your colabes @RyanGeorge. Your voice & acting changes. You seem too real. I really like when you make an extra effort to enunciate. It's kinda your thing.
Wait, how did Ryan and Julie come into existence if they were the first couple to have a baby? Were they the first people into whom monkeys evolved?
Do one of those cringy "We're pregnant!"  Youyube videos.
I bet they didn't struggle to have a baby one could also assume it was super easy, barely and inconvenience
Fantastic video.
And Ryan speaks perfect french too! What CAN'T you do! Love you guys!
it is kind of a rip of of:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqz4JETekYM
So there parents arent couples, interesting
Not all Canadians are funny , but per capita we rule the world when it comes to humour .
What a great video from this great collab!
The one thing babies do better than adults, MAKE NOISE.
I am French & Ryan I loved your accent 🤣🤣
You can't prove anything. I died lolol
You are too funny
"It does look pretty dumb"  Exactly my thoughts when I see babies lmao
That’s bull shit who had them
So glad y'all did a video together or I would've never found Juile 😀!! Now we all from both channels get to enjoy! MORE COLLABORATIONS!
that was pretty good.
Good stuff!
Julie looks like my science teacher
"It looks like you"  Lady, in this universe, that could be literally anyone.
OMG I just fell in love with your outro. 😂 It’s this perfect blend of awkward with ‘you’re still here? 🤔’
But the question is: Where did the couple come from? It's a paradox!
"A dumb wrinkly potato, but i would die for it."
How could she possibly think it has anything to do with him? Or is she just doing the typical woman thing and blaming men for everything??
Good Video👍🏻!
Great combo!  You two were made for each other in comedy heaven!
That baby is horrifying lmao
I'm sure they have plenty of over lapping fans, but I know there are plenty who don't really watch Ryan's stuff and just see him when he guest stars here. That group must have been dying when they did the baby face reveal.
My favorite Bible verse is the one where Eve tells Adam he needs to poop more.
I don't like seeing Ryan out in the real world. It freaks me out.
I like how each video is in the respective style of the channel owner.
Ryan is not trying to get caught with child support y'all! 😆 🤣 😂
CGI baby Ryan is a horrifying as the CGI baby from Twilight
Bloomin hilarious!!! Loved it!
You brought back the Ryan that eats blood?
I can imagine the prequel to this story.  “So you want me to put my peeing rod into your bleeding hole?”
So Ryan moved into Julie's place?
So this is the origin of Ryan’s cannibal baby 🤔
its like a pitch meeting for having a baby or something...
thats a bot
is that sharmonika?
that was the most horrifying baby ever🥴🥴
Good to see you both working together....amongst other things, apparently.  😁
I think thier names are adam and eve
Meh. Sounds like stupid children
She's definitely Winona Ryder!!!
That baby face is so disturbing... Ryan.
Kind of a chicken and egg thing.  If this is the first couple to have a baby, then how the heck did we end up with 10,000 Ryans?   Cloning maybe?  😂
Mark Twain level stuff here
So you have a baby for me?
That image will forever be burned into my brain...
Wait... That small thing does have teeth
It sounds like two AIs talking....
This must have been so awkward to make lol
Subscribed
This little frenchie is into some weird stuff
but how did they make the baby  we need  1st couple to ever have s3x  1st couple to ever get pregnant, now
oh wow oh wow oh wow.
Girl with baby you're hot don't go with this guy all right he's a loser you need me and I'll take care of that baby for you I mean like take care of it find it a home so we can live peacefully and quietly together trust me it'll be okay we can live in separate rooms except for when I want sex you know what that is obviously
Foreshadowing!
Having a baby is super easy barely an inconvenience
I just watched a video about why Y chromosomes won’t be around forever, and this has got to be the best follow up video. I’m dying from laughter xD
Leaked footage of Adam and Eve.
This did not land
A dumb wrinkly potato... I literally just lost my shit!!!   :)
You guys have a great chemistry! Great Collab!
Such positive energy!
Shiiiit how did I miss this Ryan Nolke collab 3 months ago?!  Need more!
We know where Julie is on the hot axis…I just wonder where she is on the crazy axis.
Ok that was not funny
these are how new Ryans are made
Not to put Ryan on the spot but his Quebecois accent really shine more in this video! I think it's one of the biggest accent I heard in a video yet! ahahah Love his sketch, I'll be checking more of yours now! ahah
If they are the first couple to have a baby, how were they born? Were they just created?
Oh god it's hideous......just like his Dad!   (Well, like half his Dad, which explains the uggers.)
If that's the first child then how they both were born😂😂
Wow that was adorable. You do do more videos with Ryan. Looking forward to it.
drake
I hope we get more of these collars. They are both hilarious and work well together.
Arretez svp😂. Should be “arrêt😌. For the rest funny as always
Nah.... It's not his, it was that burrito.
lol I used to have one of those, but it got bigger so I gave it to one of my neighbors.
Ok I thought this was gonna be like how humans discovered that inserting your thing into a opposite gender’s thing and when your thing eventually explodes in 9 months you’re gonna have baby. Nah for real though how the hell did humans figure out how to reproduce?
That is the most terrifying baby face I've seen since Junior.
I lost it at "I poop like once a week"
This is exactly what Adam and Eve were going through 😂💀
They are totally dating haha
Adam and Eve with Cain and Able
Who came first? You or Ryan?
You didn't talk about her becoming increasingly fat around the belly area the last nine months 🤔
Why does Ryan look so buff in this video?
After age 35 pooping is no problem.
Umm how was the man and the woman born then?
Fits every time, but this time especially: "Kill it! Kill it with fire!"
YIm sure that how it really unfolded with Adam and Eve
OH NO  It's Ryan Jr! Quick, call a Catholic Priest and get the kerosene!
Ha!
The two of them should actually have a baby and help launch the baby’s first YouTube channel.
cant believe they divorced😭
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH not the monster baby again!!!
I was NOT ready for that FACE REVEAL! lol GREAT JOB, GUYS!
Adam and Eve:
Nitai.
The cursed Ryan baby is back…
They didn’t even mention her belly growing spherical for 9 months
- you should be pooping more! - I’ll try… 😂😂😂
So glad Ryan brought me here
I just realized they aren't even in the same place. very well done.
"Like a dumb, wrinkly potato but also I would totally die for it if that makes sense?"
Your french accent is very on point actually Ryan
Would have been good if baby Ryan said blood, blood.
"I've always had teeth, I think?" GOT ME 💀
Haha (my baby son didn't sleep untill 2:30am
These two were made for each other.  Born for one another, even.
Adam and Eve 😂
Plot twist: Ryan George actually played the father, mother, and the baby. He's just really good at acting
🌎🌏🌍
He is ready to go buy milk
Hey some parents are actually this clueless with their babies. Which is why we need social workers.
Wait so you’re suppose to poop more than once a week?
HE SPEAKS FRENCH WITH A QUEBECKER ACCENT!!!! My hero!
Yeah.. I wasn't gonna say something at first but they definitely uhmm y'know
No disrespect cause I don't know any better, but this gives me Tomska vibes.
And then along came the first dna test
This is making my head hurt just thinking about the impact and magnitude of instincts. I mean, prehistoric people and animals have something grow in them, likely don't understand at all what is happening to them, and then go through the greatest pain ever probably thinking they are dying while pushing this little being out of them and then just go: "Yup, I'm going to nurture and raise this as mine now."   Like... am I the only one who finds that mind-blowing?
First guy to ever skip child support payments....
I mean, I cannot imagine it being easy to prove it's his when literally EVERYONE in the world looks the exact same.
The two of you together are magic.
Love it, when you two team up.
You two are adorable together! MORE!!
Good luck with that.
Like a dumb wrinkly potato but I would totally die for it if that makes sense 😂
Super easy, barely an inconvenience.
That baby was the stuff of nightmares
Dat baby don't look me!
That baby looks like satan’s spawn 🤠
I expected him to disappear halfway through the video. What a good man that he didn't!!
Julie? I still can't tell which one is Ryan George.  Is Ryan the poops-once-a-week guy or poops-on-Julie guy?  Ryan George's comment isn't helping. . . or is it?
YESSSS I LOVE HIM!!!!
Adam and Eve be like:
Ryan with wig is not as funny... And he doesn't look like Ryan. Weird.
I keep trying to come up with a reason why people randomly had amnesia and knew how to talk and have some memories but most gone. So everything seems like the first time. And all the guys look Ryan.
The implications to the Ryan-Julieverse
2 of my favorite channels together!!!!!!!
You two work so well together!
I am a grandma for the first time ever today.. my son is 22 and I forgot exactly how all those things actually make damn sense! sooooo loud!!!!!!! I can truly say I am crazy about you baby girl never a dull moment
You two Canadians are pretty funny together!
Adam and Eve conversation when Cain and Able were born
First time I’ve disliked one of Julie’s videos. Men in my fam LOVE babies. I’ve worked with more preschoolers than most women. In this anti-men era please try a more man/baby positive spin.
Concept: What if God made Adam & Eve in the 1st Century instead of ~4000BC
The title implies that every other birth in the Ryan verse was done by a single mom.
2:18 that looks fucking cursed xDDD
Just heard recently; "The crying and the diapers is the easy part."
So this is how the Ryanverse started
have you asked the doll if wants to go back? xD
What if people never have a baby how does human even existing  🤔
Adam and Eve be like:
The poop sound is too realistic. Gross!!!
Ryan, please, please stop having children. Why are your children always horrific and gross!? What..how... did you drop that baby? Like, 17 times? Out of the 4th story window, onto the tar?    I can still see it's face when I close my eyes... I... I.... I can't unsee that....
Julie is so weird.
😂😂😂💖
For a moment there I thought he was gonna go "So, you have a little person for me?"
The ryan babies back
"Like a dumb wrinkly potato, but I would totally die for it."  I'm dying 😂😂😂😂
You can't prove anything YET.
I wonder how come the parents exist if that is the first baby
Gold!
If they are the first Couple to have a Baby, then who are there's Parents?
That baby wants blood.
This was hilarious
You can't prove anything.... I'm dying right noe
"... ...You can't prove anything." 🤣🤣🤣🤣
So basically Adam and Eve 😂
Why did I get Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois vibes when he said « Arrêtez »
BLOOD BLOOD
Pro-life enters.
Why did I feel like that was a Quebec accent o.O
I poop at least 5 times a day.
You to are hilarious 😂😂😂😂👍👍👍
The video hasn't even played yet and I'm just waiting to see how they explain her getting fat and then the kid coming out and her getting thin again... has GOT to be seriously effed up.... (grabs popcorn and watches)
"It's obsessed with my nipples for some reason"  "Yeah, I get that..."  🤣🤣
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm haha
Great. Now I have to poop.
i didn't know Adam and Eve had a modern house, and can speak english!
Love seeing this couple again.
I lost it when it cut to the baby's face 🤣🤣
"you can't prove anything"....   100% the first thougth every man had when they woman said "we're preganant"....
You made that over there, I was over here.  😂
you should have made a real baby then it would be funnier
If it was first couple then how are they alive🤔🤔🤔
This is how AI probably will make sense of this world.
Baby Ryan strikes again
My first memory of my mom babysitting her friend’s baby was it spraying shit everywhere during a diaper change.
So the ryan universe is not a race of lifeforms that reproduce via mitosis? Good to know.
You can’t prove anything . 🤣🤣
Love your guys collabs.
Adam and Eve like
This is like Ryan's routine but at 1.5x speed. Makes it seem more scripted and read than acted. IMO this would greatly benefit from slowing down a little :-)
"I'll try" was a killer line, and the emotional climax of the story.
Adam and Eve origin story
Love love love both yalls solos but damn if you guys aren't great @ making content together 😆! Glad I came across one of these while watching his now I gotta play catch up on even more lol. Great video!
The baby has teeth
Ryan : *Sees a little person* Also Ryan : "Time to purchase milk I decided."
Are they both single cuz maybe they could get married for real lol
I thought this was on his channel so when you showed up at the end I got very very surprised
So are these people Adam and Eve?
a kid with that face who isn't yelling "blood!!"?? fascinating
It does look really dumb... So true.
lol that baby looks 100% like Ryan
2:18 that looks horrifying, ngl
So canonical Ryan and Julie are Adam and Eve?
was confused when that adstronaut wasnt there
Baby Blood Ryan is back! 😀 😨
😭😭😭 wow
Blue Lagoon.
To be fair, everyone in that universe looks like Ryan George, so that doesn't help you prove paternity.
I like when you two collab they are so good
The basic concept of this video reminded me of the movie The Blue Lagoon: that's not the first couple to have a baby, but as they're completely unaware of what's happening, it feels in the movie as though they are.
Oh my god the demon baby returns!!!! I did not expect that
so 15 million years ago
that was disturbing
ya YOU did that I was over THERE somewhere.
It was ur burrito man
That was funny!!!
plot twist; the child looks like big male person's brother........
Technically they’d be born too so can you actually trace the first couple to have a baby?
2:19 THE RETURN OF THE DEMON CHILD
it does look pretty dumb
This may well be the perfect pairing.
Baby/kid Ryan will never not be terrifying.
Nightmare fuel...
Wouldn't this mean Ryan & Julie are playing Adam & Eve?
Sooo. you gyus get married, get divorced, have a baby and then move in together. weird.
😹🤣🤣
HILARIOUS!
Was it just born with a full head of hair, a beard, and teeth?! 🤣🤣
And that ladies and gentlemen is why instinct is a thing 😂 so this can not happen
THE CHILD
Me: Mum can we have a baby? Mum: We have a baby at home. Baby at home: 2:20
The ultimate crossover produced the ultimate result. Please more of that!
But how are these two the first couple to have a baby. Where did they come from then ?
😂
😭😂
inb4 cancelled for 'frenchie'
Me watching this video be like: HOL UP-
Dude just acted Adam and Eve out
Ryan: Poops 1x per week Me: Poops 3x per day
L'accent québécois LOL!
That CGI was horrific. Thanks for the nightmares
IS THAT QUÉBEC FRENCH I JUST HEARD YOOOOOO
Baby Ryan returns
Baby Ryan returns
"I'll try." 🤣
OH NO THE CURSED BABY IS BACK
Julie & ryan sitting in a tree....🤣
You two should work together MUCH more often.
Sooooo you guys are basically adam and eve 🙂
Found you thru Ryan, glad I did 😁
Yasss the reunion!
Congrats!
so you have a baby for me? YESSIR I DO! SUPER SIMPLE, HARDLY AN INCOVENIENT
Very inaccurate stuff here.  There once was infact the first couple to have a baby.. but that's not the same as the first baby.
The lord is expanding
Julie and Ryan collabs are literally my favorite thing on YT.
"Like a dumb wrinkly potato I would die for" is parenting in a nutshell.
🤣
Their name? Adam and Eve.
looks like the baby is going to yell "BLOOD" 😄
Whoa is Ryan québécois?
Nobody must have invented pain or a hospital, yet, because if someone in the next room was giving birth, you would not be sitting around like that... Or they haven't invented helping?
Are there any more in there??😂😂
Ryan:  Baby: Hi there. Hello. It's me, your child. Ryan: Yeah, that's not mine.
oooh, good french, there!
🤣 ya'll are the best with these
this is why we have DNA testing now lol dad's have to invest in their kids
This explains everything @nagad
<3 ^_^
"I'll try..." 🤣
This is perfection.  I broke down cry-laughing when I saw the baby Ryan face.
Ryan bagged …. Nice 😎
So are the George genetics just SO STRONG that every baby looks exactly like the dad
"This just came out of you." Oh no
Girls stop pooping little persons it's extremely weird.
Great video! Came from George's channel because he told me to. Well he didn't tell me directly, but he did say it through this tube thing I was watching. I have to be honest, I was sceptic at the beginning. I couldn't believe you were another whole person because he is always talking to variants of himself. But you looked too beautiful to be him, don't take ne wrong, he is a handsome person, but there was something different about the girlfriend character that made me doubt it could be him. So here I am. Hope he takes responsibility for the burrito baby. Where is the adstonaut at the end of the video? Did he finally fall out orbit and lost contact?
this was great 😆
"You can't prove anything", actually it's super easy, barely an inconvenience.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"I'll try"..."You can't prove it"... Sees the baby's face! Well done, guys.
So funny 🤣🤣 Definitely love your collabs.
We need to stop having children. Future generations will thank us
Never show us manbaby Ryan again thanks bye 😂
Watching this while holding my two week old, and relating SO much. The disbelief in the amount of diaper changes is spot on. 🤣
J'oublie toujours que Ryan parle français ^^
You two are Youtube peaking
That baby face killed me
The baby face thing was predictable but it still got me good. :'D
Adam and Eve
"Dumb wrinkly potato that keeps eating and pooping" + "I would totally die for this potato" = parenthood. Alternatively equals owning a pug.
Funniest crazy thing I ever saw! :D
If you're not poopin like a baby you're not poopin enough. It's a common expression, everybody know
😸😸😸 love the morning sickness part you threw in
Excuses moi svp arrette 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The first guy to go get some milk
This is such a great mashup of talent.
They better be doing it in real life! Amazing together!
so great they SHOULD have a TV show together. Funny that they clearly do these vids in different locations. Love to see them IN THE SAME FRAME
Oh French dolls are tight
😂
Can't really say the baby is his. Every guy in Ryanverse looks alike.
I love this.
Damn Julie you look good for having just had a baby.
Baby Ryan will give me nightmares for years to come
Oh no it's the "BLOOD" baby
Now we know the mom of that mysterious child in Ryan's other sketches. But it's sad to know that they're also going to get divorced, which we also know from another sketch.
Funny how they are a baby when you want it and a clump of cells when you don't
Paradox! Paradox! PARADOX!
So funny! You guys should make one of a couple talking to another couple but both couples played by you two 😁
lol y'all tripping
You two are great together in videos! Please do more!
THE MOST IMPORTANT MESSAGE FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD💬💬💬  (This is gonna be long. You can skip it if you want, but the Lord is soon to come. He will bring judgment for everyone who sinned against Him. This is the message of hope.)  What is the most important thing in life?  Well, if God exists, then it must be to get to know who He is, and to know what will happen to you after you die. ☝️☝️☝️  So where would you go when you die? ☠️  The Bible says all of us have sinned against God. All of us have offended the holy and just God whose justice requires our lives! "The soul that sins shall die — the penalty of sin is death."  So if everyone sinned, then everyone will die! God promises eternal condemnation for all who sinned against Him.  We are sinners living in despair in this world. We're here to suffer the  world for a time and suffer the next world for eternity.  There are people who tell us doing good things will save us from God's judgment. No, not really. Romans 6:23 says that the wages of sin is "death", and not good works. We must pay our sins with our own lives!  "Well, but doesn't God love us? "  Exactly! The Bible tells us that because of God's unconditional love for us, He became a man 2000 years ago to die for all our sins. ❤️❤️❤️  The requirement of sin was the sinner's life, but Jesus gave His life as a substitute for ours.   We sinned, but Jesus died. That's called the grace of God! God took that which is ours (our punishment) for us to have that which is His (eternal life).   If you believe in Jesus, your punishment will become His, and His eternal life will become yours.   We broke God's law, Jesus paid the fine! And He proved this by rising from the dead. I don't know about you, but if somebody rises from the dead, I'll believe what they say.  If you want to follow Christ today, then deny your whole self, and follow Him with all your heart! Pray and read the Bible daily and get to know who He is. Then start living for Him who died for you!   God bless you ❤️❤️❤️.
And that baby will grow to love _blood,_ according to legend.
This is one of the best collabs I've seen that's constantly fun to watch.
First baby to get a paternity test is next I bet.
Almost expected the baby to be like that other child in the Ryan-verse "blood" you know, that one. 😄👍
I like the way he pushed the male agenda that morning sickness only happens in the morning.
2:19 Ryan. That’s more horrifying than any horror film.
Adam and eve
respect little person🤣🤣🤣
Damn Ryan is Canadian and is actually good in French
Everyone ignoring that thats just Adam and Eve
that was a pretty neat french canadian talk there
Now, to be fair  there are dozens of people who look exactly like Ryan
So funny 😂 québécois as hell in that french sentence
I'm glad baby-ryan is back. I was almost able to sleep again.
"Like a dumb wrinkley potato but also I would totally die for it if that makes sense." Nailed it lmao
Omg! Y'all killed it! This was fantastic!! 😂😂😂
Really funny,🤣🤣🤣..hey are you guys like a couple!?!if not ,please look into that...I think it would work ...
Blood
Oh no the demon child is back 😢
That’s no baby.  That’s tiny demon Ryan and wants your blood.  I thought it was gone.  Kill it! Kill it with fire before it escapes Canada
Fucking hilarious 🤣😂🤣
It’s borderline unnerving seeing Ryan speak semi-normally for once
Brilliant
Where's the prequel? First couple to do it 😂😂😂
"Is that the burrito you had a while back?" 😂😂😂😂
Wait WTF !? That was a great french canadian accent ! Did you grow up in Quebec Ryan ??
lmao nice one
You two look like a cute couple 💑
2:17 I expected a: "I don't see it!"  Julie: ... "Well..., I don't look this dumb. So it must be from you"  Before the: "You can't proof anything"
Love it when you two work together
AHHH!! Baby Ryan!!
🤣🤣 just think first parents in BC having this conversation and just thinking what to do
Not the cursed child again
Would that technically make them Adam and Eve
Was that NPC Ryan in the first few seconds?
At last! The origin story of the cannibal baby Ryan! That thing ends up being was arrested in the Ryan Georgeverse.
c'mon now, that is barely an inconvenience!
More please!!
These colabs just make so much sense. You’re channels have the exact same type of humor
Too funny!
Is it not obvious to anyone else but me that Julie Nolke and Ryan George are clearly the same person? Editing tricks aside, the CGI isn't even that great.
So the first ever father ditched the child. Sounds about right
Julie with that quality satire
“Whoa! Hey! That’s new! Did that just come out of you?” “Yeah! It was super easy. Barely an inconvenience.”
I’m pretty sure you had something to do with this.  … You can’t prove anything.
wow wow wow wow wow wow. wow.
"I poop a lot....... like once a week" 🤣
The return of baby Ryan😨
You are NOT the father
Adam and Eve who?
That thing is cursed
Julie, you are very cute and funny.
I nearly expected Ryan to say "So you have a baby for me?" and Julie responding "Yes Ryan I do!".
I gotta love how this feels like someting between NPCs and just a pair of aliens pretending to be human
I can imagine if you guys could, you'd TRY to do some awkward "first people to.... [birds and bees]", but YouTube would probably throw a fit.    But yeah, you guys are SO GOOD together.
Oh gods i thought we saw the last of your demon spawn er i mean baby
I guess trying some of the milk that your baby does from it's mother would be generally misunderstood. It's family right?
“Especially in the morning.” “It was all day actually.” “I’m going to call it morning sickness.”  So real! Glad to know where that fallacy started! Ha!
And thats another new set of nightmares from his unholy spawn, thanks for that
Honestly, I wish I had handled parenthood as well as these two
This is the best ship on YouTube
"Blood!"
I was just waiting for the two of them to decide to toss it in the trash. 😅
I guess they also didn’t know that before disposable diapers didn’t always exist.
you two legit look like brother and sister
Sorry if im late to the party but y'all dating? Hilarious and good looking power couple!
Diapers are now dumb little potato butt area covers. 😌
Ryan is about to go buy some milk
So this is what Adam and Eve had to go through after Eden.
guys your joint videos are the height of my day, thanks a lot :)
If Adam and Eve were millenials... [grabs popcorn]
I've been Stuck in a loop of being recommended the other collab video for a week, why didn't y'all tell me to stop?
Y'all would actually make a good couple in real life tbh
Ryan looks like the older brother of that scrawny actor from that one show with the gal who’s a zombie mom and there’s the daughter and the husband with the big hair
That baby was horrifying
"I'm gonna call it morning sickness" oof my pregnant wife felt that
Oh dear god no little ryan escaped from my nightmares and is back in the videos
The fact that humans exist in a world where nobody has heard of babies really messes with my head
Being the first couple to have a baby is tight!
When you realised they're interpreting adam and eve: 👁️👄👁️
Hahaha that’s new lol
moment I saw the baby's face I was like I knew it was gonna be that
Man, both of these collabs we're great lol
“Respect, little person.” Is the exact vibe I want to have with my child in the future
Nice flexing your French, Ryan!!!
In honor of Roe v Wade let’s do first woman to have abortion
Baby Ryan is back
“I feel like it would have gone to the toilet if it could have…” Elimination Communication!
Question though did she cut the umbilical cord herself, or was a placenta dangling off of the child while this was happening
The back and forth about Ryan's poop consistency had me loling
I love your collaborations!
Where is moonknight and dr. Strange pitch meeting?
Respect, little person.
Ryan: Sooo you have a baby for me? Julie: yes sir, i do!
When she said "it kinda looks like you", I expected him to say something like "Apparently a lot of people do."
Omg, your video is hilarious 😂
At least abortion rights in Canada are safe.
im pretty sure the first couple to have a baby are the first couple to ever exist
Ok there is to much Collabs with Nicole or nikole is colabing with famous youtubes
And this is the video that made me sub
Great French!
1:57  The GOP liked that
Hilarious! 😅
"You really should be pooping more." Love the delivery...
Alternate title: "How Democrats think sex ed will work in Florida after the Parental Rights in Education Act passed"
No no you don't understand all people have that face it doesn't mean anything.
Waiting for the day producer Ryan meets Mirror Julie. Im sure its super easy, barely an inconvenience.
I thought the sketch was about the first couple in the friend group to have a kid and I was thoroughly confused for a while there.
I will be having nightmares thanks to the baby Ryan I now cannot unsee so if that was your plan, mission accomplished.
and he went on to get some milk
The baby…..I wasn’t ready. 😆
What happened to their parents?! And how were they born?
Oh no, not Baby Ryan🤣🤣
They keep telling me to go to the video on the other person's channel and now I'm stuck in a loop
Ryan's demented child has gone on to infect other channels. Run now!
The first single mother too😂
Lmao
Ryan talking to me in french was unexpected but quite pleasant
My God, you guys literally posted this the same day I gave birth 🤪 My baby is five days old
Hahahaha, the morning sickness part is spot on!
"Unless there's a littler one in this one." Well, there can be if we use Scribblenauts logic. Pregnant baby, friendly Cthulu, and scared barn are just a few of the crazy things you could make in those games.
You can't prove anything.
And here we thought the Ryan Monster Child was just a bad dream that we all had at once, we decided. But it is back.
Am I the only one that ships these 2!!
Idk why, but when they panned over to the baby Ryan's face. I was excepting him to say, "🤤 Blood!"
OH GOD WHY DOES IT HAVE TEETH?
2 things: first, I love how you worked within the other person's video style. But I'd have to say, Ryan, Julie's acting chops are a little better than yours. And she pooped out a baby, so she's kinda got you beat there.   Second, I totally called the hideous Ryan-baby-face-swap, and was terrified of its appearance the entire time.   Third (bonus!) I was pooping when I watched this. Third time this week!
Sadly Julie has no boobs, so baby couldn't eat :*(
Oh you guys in qc
Producer: "He's from the other YouTube channel!"
Does this confirm that Julie is the mother of the boy that praises for blood in The First Guy To Ever Be King?
Lol, he totally called it a doll. Broke my suspension of disbelief dude! Sheesh
LMAO I was not expecting baby Ryan
That taco nine months ago made her sick and gain a lot of wait too 🤣
“First guy to ever pay child support”
Yes!  Return of mutant Ryan!  Love it!
So how was the entire past generation born there are plot holes in the Kyle and Ryan verse😂
So is this Adam and Eve
"Kinda looks like you" is not a very solid argument in the Ryanverse
Oof I shouldn't bother with having kids
"No it was all day..." "I'm gonna call that your morning sickness." oof
Moving kinda fast, just moved in together! Lol
Best one yet!
Why are his eyes human sized?
This is an entertaining and normal version of the "entitled/insane parents" subreddit.
So glad you guys can meet in person for skits now that the pandemic is over...  Wait...
Newborn baby with scattered teeth and….A BEARD!!!😂😂😂
who else is liking this video even before watching it? 👀👀👀  EDIT: yessss as a French-Canadian I’m always happy when Ryan speaks French ❤️
Ryan, le excusez-moi arrêtez SVP m'a tuée 😂
How...how did these people get to this point without that happening before
The origin story of the cannibal child
"It was a Frech doll" LMAOOO
i would have died if that baby yelled "blood!"
Yay, you guys did another collab together!
You guys are both so Canadian. I love it.
why is this not a t.v show???
This is actually so great and funny at the same time. 1. it really had me thinking how the first baby was born, who birthed it... etc. lol..and 2. it's great how it slightly shows how men (in history) have constantly tried to mansplain things to women, like "morning sickness", even though she said she was throwing up all day. How quick he was at just blaming the baby on her, and remove themselves from the situation. This was quite genius.
hahahahah～! Usually a new born is not pretty. they are purple and not pink, and they stink a lot. But they will be adorable.
"You should be pooping more" - Julie Nolke, 2022
"Dumb wrinkly potatoes I'd die for" sounds about right
That raises questions...
You two make great collabs together!
Time for a 3am milk run
cute kid
Loved it!
You can’t prow anything 🤣🤣
this little frenchie is into some weird stuff
Either julie or ryan has gotten great at playing 2 characters
What perfect timing-My hubby and I are expecting our first this July. 😂 Funny
"Why did you do that?"🤣😂🤣🤣
Still the baby was more realistic than American sniper
I guess I have to congratulate to you, Adam and Eve!
i though it was Ryan George channel ... realised when i didn't see the add-straunaut😝
You know I've been watching for ages since the first Talking to the past during covid video, and now I think I'm fully on board for more Julie Nolke, so I subscribed. Nice work!
Curious... we never see Ryan and Julie in the same shot together... hmmm. They're the same person.
Sorry, that thing is more like a $2.5 burrito mix with last night shawarma. Ryan doesn't responsible for that little person
Such a great duo lol
So..... are you guys cosplaying Adam and Eve?
lmaoo
you guys are just awesome. The best,,
Guess I gotta sub if you're going to keep collabing.
Ryan : I just want to go to convenience store to buy a milk and never come back I decided
First couple to have a baby: Him - "Unga bunga?" Her - "Oooh aahg, hororoh." Wise words...
The poopcatcher in the rye
Great exit!  ;)
So this couple is Ryanverse&Julieverse's Adam & Eve. Biblical.
I adore you both individually, and your collabs make me absolutely giddy!! <3
The ending
Please, July, try to raise the bar.
2:18 I died
The face was pure nightmare fuel. Well done
I love the awkward pause and then, “well good luck with that” hahaha
It looked like it was hard to say “you can’t prove anything” 😉
I love this Collab! 😂
So let me see if I get this: Because Ryan was in, that little person is out?
Ahem... ... ... ... ... BLOOD!!!
Dark ending...
"That little Frenchy is into some weird stuff" broke me. Idk why. Just a great line lol.
I heard that in medieval times or, like, a long time ago, they used to think that men ejaculated embryos. They didn't know that women ovulated and that sperm from the man was fertilizing the ova, nope, they thought that men created the embryos and put them inside the women.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I literally had my first baby a week ago 😹 I love this
Is it a sign of us being bad parents if this pretty much sums up our first week with the first baby? Except the part of 'you did this over there and I was here' 😄
“I poop once a week”  Any chance there are any Jake and Amir fans out there that recognize that line?
Oh God it's the origin story....
I was already laughing my ass off but then you cut to the baby's face and I just scream-laughed. So good! You guys are both so creative and talented, I hope you continue to do awesome stuff, both together and seperately :D
Congratulations on your youtube babies.   Well done.
I had wanted a crossover between these two for ages, and now we're getting a second one?! I'm so happy
"Like a dumb, wrinkly potato but also I would totally die for it if that makes sense. " Perfect!
you're like a hotter, American Jodie Whittaker who's funny
You collaborate with Ryan?  Oh yes.  Definitely subbed now!  You’re both awesome!!! 😊❤️
Blame it on the burrito... love it
Woah, Ryan's French is on point! 😯👏🏾
I ship this so hard
I'm sorry but the accent of Ryan George in french sounded perfectly québécois. IS HE ?
Well THAT escalated quickly...
Ohh glad Julie popped up on my feed, love these colabs. More Ryan and a new channel to sub? Good times!
“Respect, little person!”  Hahahaha!
Also the first father to go get milk?
Emetophobia Warning
That got dark fast
Okay, they had a baby, but, how?  How did that baby get there?
Second colab series. You guys dating?
I really dont want to gush like a stan, but ryan and julie should just make this a real life thing if thats possible.
OH NO NOT BABY RYAN WITH THE FILTERRRRRRR
LOVE these collaborations!!! i watched both of your channels separately then nearly died of shock when you did your first video together! You both do a great job, and entertain me so much :)
and that is when I learned Ryan George is from Montreal
"I'll try." 😂
This was posted on my birthday! Perfect timing! 😆
also glad to see im subbed to you since im usually watching on my smart tv and thats not the best youtube exp for commenting subbing and liking things lol. keep it up!!!!!!!!!!!
You know when you think about it, this is a real chicken and the egg situation.
I love when u and ryan do collabs. I love both your channles. of all the channles i watch this and his are the ones that arent like science, or based on a book series or about maintenance. You always make me smile. love the drunk mirror u.
If I'm ever brave enough to spawn a human, I am going to introduce it by saying "Hey, check this out."
"It does look pretty dumb" 😂😂
You two have amazing chemistry together! I really love your collabs 🥰😍
I liked it . Just saw her for the first time in Ryan’s channel , just subscribed to hers . I like these funny videos
poop catcher is patent pending I bet
Ugh that baby gonna give me nightmares 😰
I was not ready for baby Ryan ! Loved the video !
If they didn't both have spouses, these two would be my favorite Canadian YouTuber Comedy Sketch Celebrity Couple. Top five in that category at the very least.
love u both so much and can not wait for next video on both ur channels yall are amazing and i love ur vids
Still less disturbing than the baby from twilight
I’m finding this extra hilarious because I’m watching while my dumb wrinkly potato that I would totally die for eats my boob 😆
I love you both!
...(SNIFFS)...ahhh I think I can small the baby’s shi-oh wait sorry that was me
I didn't know Adam and Eve dressed so modestly. LOL
I am slightly disturbed by the fact that the baby has a beard!
The man mansplaining that he's gonna call it "morning sickness" even though the woman is sick a lot more than in the morning when pregnant is the peak of patriarchal control and a very nice nod to men thinking they can tell women about things only women experience. LOVE IS
She's like an attractive Ryan George. Also, I lost it when I daw his face on the baby.
The baby with a beard 😭
If that thing is half him and half her, then it can only be named Julian or Rylie
I think this guy's is the producer guy with his new wife, since his old was kind of weird, her bear wasn't that great. But why he wouldn't say "wow wow wow ... WoW"? Sorry I'm to excited can't stop posting about it
Ryan: So, you have a baby for me? Julie: Yes, sir, I do!
You guys have incredible comedic chemistry, which also is a thing now I've decided.
To be fair, you really can't prove it is this Ryans baby if everyone in that universe looks that way
"Nope, you can't prove anything" dead  🤣💀
great video, thanks!
I'll have nightmares for the rest of my life from that face reveal.  But I'll wake up laughing so 🤷 worth it
😂😂😂
I was so contempt knowing I’d never have to see that baby face again. Until today. Until today.
1:04 Was totally not expecting to hear Ryan's Quebec French speaking, that was great!
Adam and Eve be like...
Pointing out that the baby can't be his due to having a different vocal register is the most Ryan George joke to make.
How come you're not funny any more ?
so funny.
Here cuz of Ryan, but it seems fun I think I'll stay.
well...they've just moved together, that escalated quickly!!
Okay, as a fan of both your content, I feel like together you form a really incredible team.
Yeah, that big burrito she choked on 9 months ago that also got her pregnant sounds more like a chef's back door special than a Chipotle regular...  Also, pro move classifying your boom stick as a burrito, Ryan.  Pro move...
Hahahaha it's funny Ryan George told me the same thing. To check out your Channel, like and subscribe. And i did 😁
"At least half"
NOT THE RYAN GEORGE CHILD COMING BACK I'M SCARRED FOR LIFE
NOOOOOOOO- THE CREEP- beautiful baby- IS BACK!!
YOOOOO BIRTH OF RYAN JR. LORE DETAILS CONFIRMED
I think the world was shipping you two a long time ago. Nice to see it in action. :-)
That was before or after him having the idea of calling her "baby"? Were babies discovered after the coinage of the word "baby" itself? I'm confused.
Great duo
"like a wrinkly potato that I would totally die for" It's so true!
Lol.
The baby cgi is top shelf!
Julie is so adorable… or adorkable, I can’t decide.
Dumb wrinkly potato! Hahaha love this collab
So basically Adam and eve
"Like a dumb wrinkly potato, but also I would totally die for it if that makes sense."
Yeap... Baby for nightmares...
King and queen of comedy. Kiu
Amazing
Adam and Eve
Mad respect little person!
Completely by coincidence, I watched this while pooping.
You 2 have no idea
Good for Mother’s Day
It’s the return of the terrifying Ryan child!
It's good to hear Bryan parler français.
I have, without consulting you, decided that you are Canada's top comedy duo.
LMAO. Respect little person.
I can imagine her being very angry; and complaining about her perineum at great length: while resentfully turning the loaf over and around like no-which-way is up, acknowledging that there's no way it'd fit flushing down the toilet, but, that it'd make a decent re-gift; and probably have to buy a terrarium or fish-tank for it, and some pellet-food.
I would love to see a behind the scenes on how they make these. It seems like they record and then have some one edit them as they are never in the same room together. I could be wrong though.
ROBINS AIR BASE, OREGON
Ryan's French is excellent btw
A forever thing; at least a life-long thing. Hopefully.
"This kind of looks like you."  I then prepared for a returning of a disturbing image.
Babe look 😳 wo that’s new 🐶 I wanted to tell u first before u hear it on the news that He is African 😃🤔🤭🧐🤠😘🤩🥳
I really loved this comedic vibe!
When they showed the baby....  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
the speed at which Ryan denied the little person had anything to do with him makes me think that maybe he wasn't the First Man to Have a Baby
Me: *forgets RG is from Montreal* RG: Excusez-moi, arrrretez s'il vous plè" Me: ..tabarrrnack!
This was dope
Could’ve done without seeing the baby’s face 😂
Loved it, hilarious as always ...... But a thought it was going to be about deciding to have a baby. But a guess they thought that would be to similar to the last one
I love when y'all Collab. It's just perfect. Maybe get married?
I was really looking forward to baby Ryan from the Ryan verse and you didn't disappoint
I just came over here from Ryan’s channel. Julie is just like the female Ryan George.
Feel like they missed the opportunity for a roe v wade joke.
Ha! I just suggested you make you this video on his channel before I saw the tiny video thing popped up
wtf i thought i was safe from the ryan baby on this channel
23 on trending!!!@ congrats
Perfect comedic duo. The two of you really has to meet.
that was great!! lol
2:18 Then it starts asking for blood!/j
It does half look like Ryan. Like a half of his chromosome.
2:15 *laughing* *realisation on what’s about to come* oh god
ryan should have said "i will go get some milk"
I'm really creeped out by that Ryan baby it's so terrifying 😂
this is Just adam and Eve talking about Cain or Abel (I forgot which one is the older Brother)
This was a great video and all but goddamn the baby's face was terrifying!!
I think we needed to see the “first copious to have sex” episode first.
Subscribed after being a Ryan-verse fan
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Greatest collab ever!!
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. Believe in him and you will be saved and go to heaven!
Good job
Pooping once a week is super easy, barely an inconvenience
That was the most terrifying baby I have ever seen.
Why is your editor this horrible  Their sentences feel like overlapping before one finishes talking
The origin story we didn't know we needed. Glad to see that little guys face again.
You two should make a baby 😉 It'd be a beautiful baby.
The first couple to get married now the first to have a baby!  What next? First couple to have a cat?
Tickled every time I hear Ryan’s French 😉😁
Ryan speaks french with a Québec accent
How are they the first couple to have a baby? Where did they come from??
383k views. Sad world we live in. Docile people indeed.
You two need to do more collaborations. You two are funny together. Put together 22 minute episodes ,get us addicted and disappear when amazon or Netflix offers you more money.
..lmao😂
So this is the sequel to the first couple to ever move in together ig
“Why is it so loud? Be quiet!”  “Maybe it doesn’t speak English, *french words*”  *baby stops*  “Oh, it was a French doll”  Best part hands down
I thought this was gonna be cringe. Guess not. Disappointed, really.
Why do people care to watch the garbage on YouTube..
We finally understand why Ryans baby is so horrifying, in the Ryan universe, everyone is Ryan, so having a baby with someone who isn’t Ryan upset the balance of the universe, leaving the baby an unfortunate monstrosity
Oh god that face why is nobody talking about how absolutely cursed it is
Mark Twains Diary of Adam and Eve.
Ah yes, the Ryan junior origin story we never asked for but needed.
*AAAA!  DEMON CHILD!  KILL IT!*
I'm still dying from "ew gross, why did you do that?"
That child will make a great king one day….. after he gets his blood lust in control
Hello everyone God bless you all. I wanted to say that God loves all of us that He sent His only Son die for us (John 3:16)   He is peace, refuge, love, and strength to those who trust in Him alone for salvation.  If you are tired and heavy laden, Christ will give you rest (Matthew 11:28-30)  He will be there for us, and can help you through whatever your situation is.  God bless you all ❤️😊🙏
I love you both 🙂 This endearing naivety in the sketches is wonderful. Especially when the pieces are so timeless, I have the impression that the humor is so easily digestible and does not lie heavy on the soul ( ˘ ³˘)ノ°ﾟº❍｡  --  Ich liebe euch beide 🙂 Besonders diese liebenswerte Naivität in den Sketchen ist wunderbar. Vor allem wenn die Stücke so zeitlos sind, habe ich den Eindruck, dass der Humor so leicht bekömmlich ist und nicht schwer auf der Seele liegen bleibt ( ˘ ³˘)ノ°ﾟº❍｡
'Like a dumb wrinkly potato'...🤣💀
Lol
I don't wanna be "that" guy but I think it's time for another "I explain my time to my former self" video. A lot has happened and we need some depressingly accurate backflash to be reminded just how ginormously fked we all are. Please.
''Excuser moi ,  arrêter s'il vous plait'' (Sorry , could you please stop ?) love it ! haha
NPC energy
Not Ryan trying to get out of daddy duty 😂😂😂
Very funny! Please do more!
We need a horror movie with that kid as the antagonist
YES, Baby Ryan is back!
https://youtu.be/cLivUQxkZhg💥
Love this skits.  I'm just hoping for more "Julie visits past Julie" skits. There is SO much more than the pandemic to really upset past Julie. Like, say, recent event with Roe v Wade... or Depp vs Heard.
The baby's face. 😂
I want Ryan and Julie to be together forever because it would be a fantastic nightmare.
😂😂😂😂😂
politely getting in line with the intro LOL of the "hey! that's new?!" -
y'all collabing is the greatest idea ever
Omg, that computer baby was scary. It should have just been him swaddled in a blanket with a binky. 👍
did you just watch The Blue Lagoon or something
yeah frenchies would just poop anywhere theyre too weird I decided. (its just a joke if any frenchie sees this dont get offended this was intented for fun and not to offend anyone)
That was what adam and eve argued back then
The thing about the ‘Frenchie’ is so annoyingly Ontario. I expect a full video on the Montréal version of this moving in series. Also
I need a Ryan/Julie collab with Ryans “the men who invented words Stuff” Meeting Julie’s group with the std’s and writing an adult film.
Ive been stuck in an endless loop clicking each other’s links at the end, how to stop?
Perfect chemistry (comedy and otherwise). Selfish request: Can you guys get together and be my parents in real life? I’m 48. Hope that is not an issue.
Here from Ryan's channel, and loving the sketches!
giving birth should be *super easy, barely an inconvenience* actually its really hard it takes a long time oh? really? yeah yeah yeah
Thank you, you guys for doing a shared skit.
We definetely need “First couple to ever be grandparents”.
That 3D render near the end freaked me out 😂
Women can't do cocaine because it is a real crime! And people just like drug use , abortion is a Crime! 😀😉😄😁😛😀😌☺️😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
Oh good the baby is the evil Ryan Jr. 🤣
I didn’t realize the canadian education system had so much in common with the us, you’d think they’d cover this kind of thing
These collabs are freaking amazing!
I really like how this implies that Ryan and Julie were the first 2 people to exist
Not sure how anyone figured out how to raise a baby before The Sims came out
My two favorite YouTubers in one video. Love you guys!
1:03 defenivement mon favoris plaisanter 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Your french is perfect !! 🤣🤣🤣
I feel like this is the exact conversation Adam and Eve had. 😂
"I'LL TRY" absolutely killed me
So is the next video, The First Couple To Put A Baby Up For Adoption? Lol
Fantastic!
Winning YouTube, Double Division. 🏁
2:17 Oh no. It's back.
Must say, she looks absolutely stellar for having just given birth.  Love the work guys!
This is exactly how me and my friend talk on acid
I get the nipple obsession as well.
Love your God so that you may enter Paradise. Believe that Jesus is the Son of God. Ask Jesus to enter your life by praying for the salvation of the soul. Be baptized as a sign of your devotion to Christ. Say the prayer for the salvation of the soul when you are ready to dedicate your life to Christ. Repent of your sins and ask Jesus for forgiveness. Vow to follow Jesus for the rest of your life...
Very funny!
JULIE! We had an agreement with Ryan to NEVER see that creepy baby again, and you made him break it! 😭
😂 that face though. Great to see where baby Ryan came from
Cannibal Child: The Origin Story
A heavy-duty poop catcher. We used three or four of them after our daughter was born.
a little comment.
2:18 "blood"
I don't know why, but "-I'll _try_ ," just hit me so hard like 😂😂😂
Part 1 first people to get married Part 2 first people to move in part 3 first people to have a baby part 4 first people to have divorce
sometimes i dont poop for 2 weeks is this normal i dont remember the last time i pooped
"This little Frenchie is into weird stuff" 🤣
It was all good until I saw the baby
OH NO the weird Ryan baby version is back!
Best collabs are with you two!
That was HILARIOUS! 😂🤘
Ryan's quebecois accent sneaking out here
Enjoying Julie and Ryan collabs is super easy, barely an inconvenience!
I'm just going to go out for death inhaling sticks or squeezed cow juice.
Hey, you are no longer fat, yeah, I think it had something to do with this little person living inside me
Ryan's CGI background looks *exactly* like an apartment in Canada.
$10, bet its first word is blood
Okay, the CG baby got me
9 months earlier, the first couple to ever have sex: Ryan: Hey so I have this new thing that I want to try out...
I so love how Ryan just sits there at the beginning doing absolutely nothing looking like he's trying to figure out what is happening. In his universe he was just thrown into it without a prior knowledge about anything so the whole confused look is very fitting.
It's super weird to see Ryan George in a real, not greenscreened room and talking to another person who doesn't have his face.
My sister literally had twin boys last month. This is so accurate and relatable.
Lol awesome. The baby has two teeth though...making breastfeeding hard I'm guessing. Thank God for DNA testing.  Also, "like a Russian doll" and "speaking French"? It's funny because nations wouldn't exist yet, if this is the first human couple. Yes, that's nick picking. Sorry. You guys are awesome BTW.
I love that in this universe almost every man looks exactly like Ryan and almost every woman looks like Julie
Awww, the cute couple that got married and divorced during the pandemic is back. Showing us scenes from their marriage. 😅  Plz, do a couple more down the road. The best fun
A fun nickname for it could 'Baby' (and keep it wrapped up cuz it's cold outside!)
It would have gone to the toilet but there was no space with the two of them on it.
More please
oh no: the origin story of Ryan's nightmare son.
It's got teeth way too early.
great vid why you not in space?
The whole pandemic wouldn't have been the same without you two. 😄
The Diary of Adam and Eve by Mark Twain or just stream The Adventures of Mark Twain, claymation masterpiece.
Creepiest baby ever! 😂😂 I love all of Ryans videos and saw fair share of Julie's. Unsurprisingly great colab.   Great video!
I mean how much more proof do we need that Canadian humor is god tier
respect little man
This is comedic gold. I would love to see a part two right where this sketch leaves off.
and thus jerry springer was born
You guys are PERFECT together!!!
I was like "how are they going to prove its his kid too when the bit is they didn't know what babies are before now?" And then you showed the babies face and I died laughing.
‘Good luck with that’ 😂
I was like "how are they going to prove its his kid too when the bit is they didn't know what babies are before now?" And then you showed the babies face and I died laughing.
“It’s obsessed with my nipples for some reason.“ “Well, I get that.”  “There you go, it was a French doll.”  I love the awkward energy they have in these skits.
What's amazing is this epiphany I am having that two people who normally act with themselves are also perfectly natural doing a scene with someone else who is not there.  It's a perfect match!  I wonder how long you could sustain a narrative between two people who never share the screen but live together in the story.  What an amazing filmmaking challenge.  Could it be a whole movie?
Two of my favorite tubers together!
The ryan child was to creepy we decided...but then money happend so you had to make an origins story didn't you?
this is the shipping fanfic the fans have always wanted
Creepiest baby ever! 😂😂 I love all of Ryans videos and saw fair share of Julie's. Unsurprisingly great colab.   Great video!
Ryan's son is the stuff of nightmares as usual.
Guys there has been a grave mistake. Why does Ryan's girlfriend not have Ryan's face?
OK, so I found your channel yesterday and now I'm addicted.
I really wonder what Mirror Julie thinks of all this.
I really enjoy when you and Ryan do Collab's.
Omg I live for these collabs
You're great at figuring stuff out.
My favorite part about Julies videos is that they're funny when I watch them.
I was like "how are they going to prove its his kid too when the bit is they didn't know what babies are before now?" And then you showed the babies face and I died laughing.
I always wanted a origin story for Ryan's creepy child, thanks
lol
“It’s obsessed with my nipples for some reason.“ “Well, I get that.”  “There you go, it was a French doll.”  I love the awkward energy they have in these skits.
Two of my favorite internet people that I don’t know but love ❤️
OH GOD NO THE BABY RYAN IS BACK!!!
I love the idea that in the Ryan/Julie universe, clothing, houses, beds, toilets, burritos, the English and French languages, art, watches, dolls, and the country of Russia all existed prior to anyone having children.
im so happy its blowing up
im so happy its blowing up
The whole pandemic wouldn't have been the same without you two. 😄
J’savais pas qu’il parlait bien français de même
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZazNbG_3m9A
Democrats: ABORT IT NOW BEFORE IT’S TOO LATE!
I was like "how are they going to prove its his kid too when the bit is they didn't know what babies are before now?" And then you showed the babies face and I died laughing.
Definitely need a part 2
Will they figure out how to prevent there being more wrinkly potatoes?
"Like a dumb, wrinkly potato but also I would totally die for it, if that makes sense?"
This is comedic gold. I would love to see a part two right where this sketch leaves off.
Love this collab team! Ryan got me into this channel!
The origin of the lil demonic Ryan thirsting for blood...
You guys are the best comedy duo i swear  😂👍
This is funny but the clips overlap too much. Sometimes the response sentence cuts in too soon.
Once you realise Julie was just in the other room in labour, Ryan's awkward expression in the first scene makes a lot more sense
Those Russian dolls are just full of themselves - Rowan
Love Ryan's reaction boiling down to "You can't prove anything." Which might as well lead to "The first criminal caught by DNA evidence"
Julie is such an amazing actress.
For crying out loud NOW I KNOW WHY HE WANTS TO BUY CANADA!!!! You've been unmasked Ryan George. Stop trying to hide your french Canadianness XD
This is comedic gold. I would love to see a part two right where this sketch leaves off.
put that child on mute
These two have achieved awkward perfection
Maybe just a 100 more with Ryan please.
I love how when they do collabs, they still have it in the style where it's only one person allowed on screen.
I expected creepy baby Ryan to scream "blood!"
It somehow makes sense that Ryan does absolutely nothing until you interact with him.
You're even better than a unicorn because you're real.
I'm glad you're both back together after the divorce! :D Congratz on the baby by the way! If it starts yelling "BLOOD"!  Be scared, be very scared!
I was waiting for the part where Julie invents child support.
Ryan a un accent québécois parfait!  He has a perfect Quebec accent! 🤩😍
Thank you very, very much for this early birthday present. I love it when you two work together. Ryan George and Julie nolke are the best
Hah, joke's on you. I subbed to both channels long ago.
1:08 that sounds more like a snapped neck Tham pooping
First dad to leave for milk
First Guy To Ever Lose a Paternity Suit?
OH GOD, IT'S BACK!   ONLY FIRE CAN DESTROY IT!!
Oh no, the creepy 'young Ryan George' has infiltrated Julie's channel! That thing is creepy.
Is it weird that I want to lick your feet Julie? I mean I'd totally be taking a gamble... that's the weird part. Like, you look beautiful and I'd assume your feet are totally scrumptious... but I. Don't. Know. It's weird right?
The bed. The floor lamp. The room. Looks like mirror Julie will suddenly appear and join the conversation any moment!
I think both of you should collaborate with Tatiana Maslany.
“You can’t prove anything” That’s what the scientific method proves lol.  So.. I guess a gene test, divorce papers, delayed baby shower, and possible orphan is coming up soon…
I was always wondering what came first the chicken or the egg but it was always gonna be the YouTube video first
Tu parle francais?
😂😂
YESSSSS OMG I SCREAMED WHEN I SAW THIS VIDEO LOUDER THAN I SCREAMED YESTERDAY WHEN I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS 9 ALREADY AND THIS LOVE TV CAME OUT IM SO GLAD U GUYS ARE DOING THIS AGAIN <33
I was subscribed to both of u already
oh no....the demon son returns😳😳😳
As good as anything that was on SNL back when it was witty and funny and entertaining.
oh god deepfake young ryan is back we begged him to never show that again
I was not ready for the horrors of baby Ryan. It's worse than wrinkly potatoes that babies usually are.
The subtle "life long commitment"... fucking priceless.
But if they're the first couple to have a baby who had those two? So many questions
I know most of this is a joke but as a pharmacist i just thought I should say that for some people its perfectly normal and healthy to not poop every day, i get so many people asking for laxatives they don’t actually need because they think they are required to poop daily
That wasn't the good half.
Not the Ryan terror baby!!! The face of many nightmares!
Oh Julie - this was sooo educational! Thought l was the only one it'd happened to!  Ton of hugs to the 3 of you from NZ!💖
Oh, no! Kid Ryan is back 😮
-Did you have trouble delivering that little person? -Oh no, it was super easy, barely an inconvenience!
Thank you Julie! For making my real crappy day a WHOLE lot lighter!! I LOVE your insane humor!
Is that the same conversation their parents had when they were babies?
MiniRyan: Origins
AWESOMETASTIC !!
More Ryan George crossover! I love to see these collabs, you're both great.
Keep doing these collabs you guys are hilarious together
Is it just me or Ryan decided to collab with her because he’s just tryna tap that?
Hold up. Is Ryan George hot...?
Aw, it's so uplifting to see straight people trying to be funny. Keep trying guys!
We need a new explaining the pandemic to my past self!
little comment.
I really love these colabs with Ryan George, I decided.
Babies = It  Very Woke, not assuming it has a Sex.
I laughed so hard at the Ryan’s baby clone.  🤣🤣🤣
You guys are HILARIOUS!!!  Been subscribed to both of you for years.  Thank you both for the laughs!
That Ryan baby is things nightmares are made of. Thanks..
After 4 you stop wondering and just do sleep walking
I LOVE how he was just sitting there staring at the wall before she came in🤣🤣🤣
Lol High whomever watching this
Cute couple.  Cute bebe
Two of my favorite super wholesome content creators. Great collab!
"On second thought, maybe I will stick around. Now that you've pointed out how much it looks like me, and also you prevented me from jumping out that window. Maybe I'll stick around and see if it gets any bigger, or if all the food is just going to keep coming out the other end. Maybe we can put all our hopes and dreams into it, and then we can argue when it lives up to none of those. Definitely you should figure out whether to dress it in pink or blue clothes, because if it eventually gets big enough to accidentally make its own potato monsters, I want to know whether it will be doing the wet and painful part, or the being oblivious part, and if those expectations for years from now don't match the color coding we're designating now, I'm going to be VERY UPSET!"  "I think we should share the responsibility for it"  "Exactly! So you'll feed it, and clean it, and put it to bed, and teach it most of its life skills. And I'll teach it... like... how to toss a ball back and forth"  "That sounds fair"  "But yeah, this could be good. I mean you and I are going to die"  "Right now?"  "No, but eventually. People seem to like doing that. And if this tiny stupid person who shits on us eventually gets bigger and independent, then it won't even matter that we're going to die eventually. Because our genes will live on"  "It's like our legacy!"  "Our legacy!"  "... Whoops. It's dead"
Gotta wonder (for all the strict Christians out there) did Adam and Eve have a similar discussion or did that apple of knowledge teach them EVERYTHING... and if it taught them everything did it not at least mention the "pull out method" ?  Great short guys.
I'm really glad I followed the link Mr. George left at the end of his video; This was a lot of fun to watch!  Thank you for sharing, and I hope to see more of your videos soon.
“Oooo this Frenchie is into some WEIRD stuff” 😂😂😂
"It's obsessed with my nipples" I get that "Like it's trying to eat my boobs" Can't say I haven't tried that   🤣🤣🤣🤣
lol
"I think you had *something* to do with it"   Gold!
"I poop a lot, like once a week!"  Hmmm definitely might want to get that check out my guy.
what does mirror Julie have to say about this tiny person that popped into existence?
So that's where all the Ryanverse characters come from
They went from wanting a Divorce to having a baby😂😂😂😂.
woah julies hair looks great in this
"But what about the clothes of the small person?" "What if they were just one piece?" "What?" "Those have to be just one piece i decided"
OMG Ryan's "respect, little person" killed me 🤣
That first angle looks familiar.  Is there a mirror Ryan in this universe?
Nah, he didnt have anything to do with that one. Doesnt look like him at all, like ryan got teeth
2:13 As soon as Julie said "This kind of looks like you", I'm like "Oh dear! The Ryan baby has returned!" 🙀😆
Hilarious.
I dunno...seems like this would be super easy, barely an inconvenience... 🤔
"It does look pretty dumb" *baby looks exactly like him
YEEEEEEEEEESSSSS!!!!!!  KID RYAN IS BACK!
Love these collabs you guys do together!
Wow.
"This lil Frenchie is into some weird stuff '' 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
Canadian humor is "different" Like bad different.
So the first dad was a 2022 republican.
Well I can't say I havnt tried that myself. Respect, little person.. 😂😂
BB Ryan is still the cutest bb on the interwebs lol
Oh god baby Ryan returns.
You guys do great collabs.
eyy my two favorite comedy channels colabing again!! will definetely watch both of these like 7 times!
Losers
The baby still looks better than the one in the Twilight movies xD
If I had a nickle for every time I had to see Demented Ryan Baby, I'd have 2 nickles. Which isn't a lot, but it's rather unfortunate that I had to see it twice. -the worst part is i'm pretty sure i've probably seen it more-  Bad jokes aside, it's always fun to see another collab
The baby should have used one of the Pitch Meeting catch phrases.   That said, humans only breed out of ignorance or selfishness.    We can only hope the children will be wiser and more compassionate than their parents were.
That face mashing! What a punchline!
THE ABOMINATIONNIS BACK, KILL IT WITH FIRE!
Oh wow! That Québec accent realy do be showing when ryan talks in french!
This is really clever.
That baby's face was pure nightmare fuel. Well done!
Cutest couple ever just don’t have kids. EEEWWWW…
2:17 Oh god no, who knew that the Blood Demon Child was Poor Julie's offspring.
This is so awesome. 😂👌🏼
Omg it's Ryan Jr! Wonder what side of the family he got his blood obsession from...
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. Believe in him and you will be saved and go to heaven!
1:56 Parental abandonment is tight!
So I guess this is what happens when you move in with someone. Eventually a tiny person just pops up
I really liked this collab, and this series of collaboration from you both is great work! I'd love to see a sketch based on a couple fighting over a new couch for the first time.  Thanks for the joy and chuckles!
Omg yay another Julie and Ryan collab! They’re so funny both individually and especially together!
Julie, do all your collabs with Ryan end up in his style?
better punchline for the end would have been for Ryan to say that the baby looks like literally every other guy he's ever seen.
IT'S DEMON BABY RYAN! WE LOVE THAT LITTLE GUY!  ... But also kill it with fire
The baby is back from hell, I see.
I love Ryan George tying his Quebec french into this sketch!  As always, great job, super funny!
Its official!! Ryan and Julie are now a family!!
My dreams are now forever haunted.  Thanks you two!
Collabs are TIGHT!
how do you leave more than one like on a video?
How does that CG baby look better than the one from that one Twilight movie ......
Wild
How did that happen when the dude is gay?
Now that's brilliant, great job you two!!!
I lost it at the end... "You can't prove anything." The delivery was gold
Wowwowowoww
Turks and Caicos
The very first man trapping thing in a blanket.  Phew, it almost worked.
You're so cute Julie. I've said it before & I'll say it again ! So be prepared 😉😉😉.
Oh god, it’s Ryan’s terrifying son
I love your videos.  Thank you for making us smile.
Adam n eve
I want more of these!!!
Meh
May be the ugliest baby I have ever seen.
I'm pretty sure the first couple ever to have a baby was like a fish or a worm or something.
hi I came from Ryan's channel
Ryan doesn't want to be involved, Julie. And you're just gonna have to get all the way off his back about it.
Omg!😂😂😂 "Why did you do that?" "I didn't do it on purpose..." Gold!
Ryan's son is back! Yeah!!!!!
That French accent was so perfect xD
We need more collaborations plz.....
These two play-off of each other SO well! Also, I've never wanted to punch a baby's face before now.
I can't stop thinking how if they had a baby, it'd be pretty, and funny! that's how babies work, right?
"You made that over there. I was over here...." GOLD
We now have the confirmed origin story for the demon baby
Ryan, you're French sounds very Québécois.  How come?
This is great
Ryan baby is back
Awesome skit
How long until they realized it needed to be called something besides "it"? Couple's first time naming video?
There are big references to Ryan's comedy styling here that definitely dovetail with Julie's method. A good laugh.
This is highly accurate
That Baby!
trash
Ouch that ryan-baby was born with teeth!   And a beard. I feel for you first woman to have a baby.
Hi Julie. Like always your acting is superb.
2:18 Why does he have teeth already!?! AND FACIAL HAIR!?
Is shitting once a week really that weird?
The Ryan-Julie chronology: First couple to move in together  First couple to get married First couple to have a baby First couple to get divorced
"Did that come out of you?" Yeah it hurt...a lot. 🤣🤣
This situation doesn’t really work with this style..unless you two are coming out of the relationship closet
"You can't prove anything." - nice to know male attitudes haven't changed throughout history.
I did not know that I needed this collab
Oh gods, the nightmare fuel Ryan George baby returned. Why ruin my day like that.   Great collab by the way.
You clearly can't prove that looks 1/2 like ryan. Thats not possible  It's at least 3/4 Ryan
So that is how that little guy came into existence.
Julie, how about "First Gal to Wear a Dress"?
2:17 WHYYYYYYY? Why did you do this to me? XD
Love this. I still hate babies and kids in general. But this is funny.
HA!   Here's my PROOF that ALL babies are UGLY!!! ..................... (uhmmm, except my 3 little angels of course! ; )
That real Québec accent from Ryan !
"it's obsessed with my nipples"  "oh yea I get that"  LOL that was good
😬
Julie and Ryan's collaborations are the best. I'd love to see mirror Julie in Ryan's poison bar.
As a French person, the pronunciation and accent was impeccable
<3  I like these clever "First" videos.
I always wondered about this! 😅
Ryan you make cute babies. Please have my baby Ryan.
I love these MCU crossovers.
That's just hilarious 😂😂. "You can't prove anything", lmfao.
I love when you 2 collab! I watched other 2. Hilarious 🤣
2:01 Holy Shit! Ryan just turned into my dad
That was hilarious
You guys are amazing apart, and amazing together, you're all around amazing. Yall keep it up!
Shit Ryan George parle français!
Just.wait until he starts calling.for.blood and expects to reign the country next
the end of the video is funny and distressing for me in a way
Lol so can they actually date though? These two are cute
You lucky Canadians.
Seeing that baby reveal was the first time I have ever laughed this hard at a video I literally lost it 😂😂😂
Hahahahaa demon baby
The origin of the cursed child from Ryan's channel
“Good luck with that” is exactly what I was thinking. Bye.
why did you do that?! xD
Laughed out loud multiple times😂 this was hilarious
I'm surprised he didn't wonder what happened to her belly and if he got fat does a child come out of him too and where would it come out of.
I always imagined what a universe with Ryan and Julie would like...then I saw their baby. And. It. Was. Awesome! Keep up the onscreen chemistry guys! Julie's first video on Ryan's channel made me follow her channel!
Big fan of both these channels.
You two are so awesome together!  I'm assuming you're not actually a couple, but I'm kind of sad about that - this chemistry works!  Please make more, I decided to ask.  Politely.  Please?
Blooooooooooooooooddddddddd!!!!!!
So excited you and Ryan did another collab!!! You two are so great!
Been following Ryan George for awhile but you are a whole different level of funny. I'm following now so looking forward to watching all your content. Thank you!!!
When will high Julie pay a visit?  Maybe high Julie could chat with Mirror Mirror Julie?  Love you’re stuff!
You two together are soooo awesome!
It looks just like him xD
The baby’s face caught so off guard then lol😂
Love your energy.
"Like a dumb, wrinkly potato, but also I would totally die for it. If that makes sense"
Enjoying Julie’s videos is super easy, barely an inconvenience
Really neat to see how the two comedic styles interact.  These collab videos are more grounded than Ryan's usual stuff and more absurd than Julie's usual videos.
I can't believe that they not only brought back the hideous young Ryan, but also delivered it to another YouTube channel entirely.
Would love the prequel to this: "First people to ever try sex" because it doesn't sound like they know whether or if it was involved lmao
This is now biblical canon between Adam and Eve.
Yep, yep, yeah, exactly mine and my wife's reaction when found out we'll become parents. And we're in our 40's...goddamnit!
This kid is going to starve lol
"Like a dumb, wrinkly potato but also I would totally die for it, if that makes sense." ❤
hurray collab!
Oh my god. What a great collab.
Cute couple. They should move in together.... because that's what couples do.
This came out the day best friend had a baby 🤣
The face reveal was one of the most terrifying things I've ever seen! 😂 Great sketch.
You two make the best collaborations! You're brilliant comics with perfect timing! :)
I think this baby is gonna have a huge lust for blood...
😂😂😂
Glad to see that the nightmare-Ryan-baby had made its way onto another channel
Love the implication that dolls are a thing but babies aren’t
"Hey, that's new!"
Argh I thought we'd seen the last of baby Ryan, that bloodthirsty nightmare 🥴
Long live the King and Queen of Canada
Hahahahha "I'll try..." Good lord.  👍
A "poop catcher" .Hey you might be onto something there. The final scene with the baby had me on the floor.😂
They moved in together because of the baby? or 9 months after they moved in, the baby happened? HMMMMM..
Scary baby Ryan :O
I guess with all the alternate versions of them both and their time traveling habits to report back from the future it was inevitable that their timelines cross and form a Julie-Ryan-Multiverse.
Oh birthing  little Ryans is TIGHT!
I thought I was safe. Now I'm going to have Child Ryan haunting my dreams again.
Checked out her other videos, seems a bit like what Ryan does.
"I think you might have had a little something to do with this.." "Nope, cuz you were over there and I was over here when you had it." "It kinda half looks like you." "You can't prove anything."🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
was not prepared for that face
Money change you. just because you have more wrinkles you don't have to show it off on the thumbnail
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That is the second ugliest baby I've ever seen 🤢
1:45 y’all are too funny!😂
Hahaha, when liberals have babies?
I DIED THE MOMENT I SAW BABY RYAN
I love it when they collaborate! 😄😄
you're both great separately but together...still great
That half and half baby face though...
Married, then divorced, have a kid, move in with each other. I think Julie and Ryan are alternate universe Ross and Rachel
I love how Ryan is just staring into space when Julie first walks into the room
Exscusez-moi. Arretez sil vous plait. You guys made my day. thanks!
The baby killed me lol
THE  ORIGIN STORY DEMENTED KID
This looks like a lot of first time parents to me, especially the “why is it so loud?”😂 gold.
Fantastic chemistry between these two. Just every time.
Oh how apropos ...
2 of my favorite channels collab.....noice
To have a WHAT!?   I don't know, I will get an appointment to see Doctor Julie for her to explain this.
You two are such fun individually and together!
Great!
good
Good news: you don't have to change diapers forever. Bad news: it's going to feel like forever.
I did not come here to hear Ryan George speaking French unprompted but I am here for it!  (also good job that was good French)
You two are perfect. Please get married for realsies. It would be barely an inconvenience.
I think its less shocking that the baby looks like him and more shocking that julie is the only one out of everyone in this cinematic universe who doesn't
Ok, this is already a classic Nolke! 💜
Damn Ryan, your french is nice! Nice Vid btw
Two YouTuber’s I like collaborating is TIGHT!
Stop being so beautiful lol
Coming from Ryan's channel! Subbed here! Glad to discover more great channels!
Quick, somebody keep it away from blood
Everytime I hear Ryan speak french, I'm a happy girl (and also remembering he lives in my hometown x) )
Video was great, baby was horrifying
oh. my. goodness. this may have just jumped to the top of my favourite list!
XD
Is this a hint that you are having or planning to have a small wrinkly potato person?
Oh no! He's going to want blood!
Wow. Sex Ed is worse over there than I thought. Yikes.....
I'm sorry, but that baby looks even more horrifying than that child Ryan George.
"Like a dumb wrinkly potato that I would die for, if that makes sense." That one got me. Hahaha!
I ship the characters they are portraying extremely hard, without shipping them as real people to prevent real life awkwardness.
The Canada is strong with these two.
The world needs Julie and Ryan to have a baby for real For it would be the chosen one promised by the ancients
Ryan speaking perfect french is so refreshing ❤️
The Blue Lagoon: Millennial Edition.
It’s a great feeling when you look in your sub box and see collab videos from some of your favorite creators
Is this considered "Canadian humor"?
that's always my first question to every girl I see, "Did that just come out of you"
No, the return of the demon baby :(
Loved that Quebec accent when Ryan spoke french
Super funny! Just subscribed to Ryans - looks awesome, shall binge watch later!
So this is the origin story of that damn blood thirsty child??? 😀😀😀
At least half of that baby looks like a baby.
Julie gave birth to creepy cgi Ryan baby!!
Oh no! Not the baby Ryan again, just when I was about to overcome my trauma!
The sickness part rings so true. People keep calling it morning sickness but pregnant women usually throw up all day lol. My personal experience.
"No. Mostly in the mornings. I'm going to call that your 'morning sickness,' that's what I'm going to call it."  That was a deep cut there. Julie's channel has a purpose. Ryan's does too, but it's mostly for forgetting about the stuff that's on Julie's channel.
lol, that got dark
This is just awesome until that baby Ryan, which I found deeply upsetting.
You two are great.
Both videos with a poop story line. I’m sensing an issue.
I discovered Julie through Ryan... To see them unite again for this hilarious vid does my heart good
That baby has a better beard than I do!
I love these two, very great chemistry for sketches!
Leading DIRECTLY ONTO THE DIVORCE VIDEO ITS ALL CONNECTED-
My two favorite YouTube comedians!
So is this exactly what the exchange was like when Adam and Eve gave birth to Cain?
Swabbing the poop deck with y'all.
Those French dolls are into all sorts of stuff :P
did you know when a baby gets older they still try to breast feed off their mother, like  in their 30s and a lot of C Blocking.  No your mom don't want to go shopping with and No you cant move back in.
You two make such a good duo. Great chemistry
I could imagine Adam and Eve being just as confused
2:19 y'all wildin' 😂
I wonder what Julies alcoholic mirror personality is going to say about this?
I will call it your morning sickness I decided
Your understanding  of fractions is way off.
Abortions
Nice sign of respect towards the baby, saying "arrêtez s'il VOUS plaît"
Just for the record: The normal "pooping cadence" is 3 times a day to 3 times a week... I know that because of Jarvis Johnson's channel.
That’s How To Collab!
Help im very easily influenced and have been watching both of their videos on a loop that never ends I cant stop it's like my brain has a mind of its own!
next episode, first couple to get a dna test. and/or figure out what dna is and then test the baby dna
That was awesome! But wow, that baby was some nightmare fuel.
"Are there any more in there?" absolutely slew me.
So, is this a flashback kinda thing because I definitely remember this couple getting married and then getting a divorce.  So why am I seeing them moving in and having a baby together?
AAH THE HD BABY RYAN IS EVEN WORSE THAN THE ORIGINAL!!!
we need a new talking to my past self!
I was hoping they would show the nightmare child and they did not disappoint !
I want to see Ryan meet drunk mirror Julie.
Oh nooo! The monster baby is back!!
Thanks!
This is how the Sims talk
Hey it’s Ryan George
It's going to be really hard for all three of you to poop in the same toilet at the same time.
wow that was fast. sure they had some "dating" before the moving in
Wait wait wait. How were there new people before this??????
that baby's face was as terrifying as the first draft of Sonic. Please never do that again thank you.
hahaha amazing guys love you both
Julie is so wholesome! She didn't even tell us to like and subscribe to her own channel
Oh, no, Ryan's nightmarish child has returned! Just when I had regained the ability to sleep again!
Don't ever show that baby again. Lol I am sure if you had a child together it wouldn't look that hideous.
Wasn't expecting another collaboration, but these two were even better than the first two! Hope there's more in the future.
"Blood!"
Which came first, the apartment or the burrito?
Thanks!
I'm going to send this to my Mom for Mother's Day! 😉
Holy fuck that baby face was cursed
You sure play his girlfriend a lot. His wife once even. I don't blame you, as I have eyes. I'm just saying people are noticing so if you did not want anyone to notice then this is not what you wanted. Okay bye.
This was cute! Oh parenting… 😬❤️🤣
Baby Ryan lives!
That baby’s face is nightmare fuel 😂
Top notch.  Nipple obsession is real.
You're not gonna show the Ryanbaby right? Please don't be showing the Ryanb NOOOOOOOOOO
I've met a few first moms ever in the history of humans
Oh, I see what you did there with that Russian Doll reference. 😎
Do all you comedy youtubers just live on the same block? lol
Wanted to see “Mirror Julie” walk in mirror holding a glass of wine, take one look, and say “Oh hell no”, and turn around and walk back off.
It’s good to see they got remarried after the divorce, but that burrito thing that caused all the throwing up in the morning, mostly in the morning, won’t solve your relationship problems.
hey, not all dads run off. If they did, there would be no word for dad
2:19 probably both the most disturbing and awesome thing I’ve seen on this channel!
Were they not in the same room for this video?? Also the "I think that's offensive", killed me
I feel like Ryan the real life human person would be a much better baby daddy than this guy. Dismissing her all-day sickness, not wanting to coparent, sexualizing breastfeeding, denying paternity.  But this is a damn good comedy sketch and I'm here for it.
yay collab
It's nice to see that these two ridiculously clever, talented and yes, attractive people are such good friends and collaborators. 😀
It’s nice that we got two prequels to the first couple to get divorced
These collabs are comedy gold, I decided
I love both of these guys separately, and to Collab?? 🤯🤯
And his first words were "BLOOD! "
Idea for video: first couple to colaborate. :)
I figured it would be more like blue lagoon (now on Netflix).
OHhhh,, pooping once a week is TIGHT!
1:21 How he points at himself when he says 'it looks too dumb for that'
You guys should legit marry IRL
Great video, really enjoyed it
BABY RYAN SUDDENLY APPEARS.
so like is this adam and eve?
Are Julie and Ryan dating?
Two of the best, TY!
"I can't say I haven't tried that myself." 😂
Origin of Ryan’s nightmare son revealed! 😱
So that’s how little Timmy was born…
His first word will be "blood"
Good luck with that, I had nothing to do with it
Julie has magnificent hair, unlike that baby.
Oh no, not baby demon Ryan George again
Goodness that's one creepy little person
Oh God I knew it. It was Ryan's freaky blood obsessed child.
Fav couple on yt
I'm pretty sure I'll be having nightmare tonight because of that baby's face...
Didn't know Julie had a new type of clone, interesting
Great to see julie collabing with baby Ryan.
"I'll try."🤣🤣🤣
I will never be able to get that freaky baby face out of my head
Creepy Ryan George baby! Sooo creepy!
Demonic CGI Ryan George isn't real, Demonic CGI Ryan George can't hurt you Demonic CGI Ryan George:
Man’s said “It’s a completely different vocal registry” 😳😂🤣
And thus the origin of Ryan's hella creepy sun is revealed.
Next episode should be first people to go on maury
So the chicken came before the egg
Their first collaboration is how I came to know her content.
It’s the return of Ryan’s horrifying son! 😂😂😂
Who's going to photoshop Julie into random pictures now that she stood in front of a green screen at the end of this video?
It is totally my head canon that every female person in the Ryan George universe looks like Julie Nolke!
🤣🤣🤣 OMFG you guys brought back the creepy Ryan kid!!!
Really was thinking Julie would call him Daddy after saying that Baby wouldn't catch on in the other vid
I watched Ryan's upload first and came here from there. I noticed his vid title features your name and this upload's title doesn't (whoopsie!) so I thought I'd try to bring it to your attention in this sea of comments so you can put it in like usual.  ☺
That cgi baby will haunt my dreams
The morning sickness line killed me
These 2 are amazing! Great job! So gross lol.
I wonder why they didn't use a line like, "You know what I noticed, your slim again like you got really fat after eating that burrito 9 months ago."
Ahh, love it when my two favorite Canadians from single-body shape universes come together. This is the true Multiverse of Madness.  Also I totally reposted this comment from Ryan's channel, because I'm lazy.
I love when they collaborate.
Hey this is really funn Sees the baby: Oh dear God!😳
That might be the most horrifying baby i have ever seen lol
Loved it!
That baby's face is cursed lol
The CGI baby head will haunt my dreams now thank you for that
Next video: First woman to be on Jerry Springer.
"You can't prove anything." lol ^o^
uh oh... better Call Maury!
"This little Frenchie is into some weird stuff!"
If the first baby looked like that, I doubt anyone would make more of them. Horrific.
Can't wait for the "First time youtube solo sketch actors play together" video!
NO. I WAS HOPING ID NEVER HAVE TO SEE THAT BABY AGAIN.   Does he still love Blood?
Oh God baby Ryan! I thought I had gotten past the nightmares. Years of therapy wasted!
Oh gosh the face is back!
"Thats super gross, why did u do that?" Hahahahahhaha awesome
Thankfully Ryan didn’t go the “At least you are not fat anymore I was beginning to worry”
The baby's face....Christ, that scared me.
Très comique de très sporadiquement entendre Ryan parler en français hahaha
Jeez, Ryan and Julie both are really good at becoming a different gender.
I don’t see any resemblance.
That last part kinda triggered me. Some men really think like this and just abandon their kids. Great video. Subscribed
The baby hahahahahhahaahaahaha
Being in to weird stuff is Tight!!!!!
Hey guys I'm stuck watching these two videos on your channels, because at the end, one video asks me to watch the other one  its been 4 hours, what do I do
I'll try
Ok, this was a brilliant use of the "Child Ryan" character. Literally did not see it coming.🤣
Ohhhnnnn is happening, the Ryan/Julie Verse is happening 😍😍😍😍😍😍
They just moved in together, and already a baby!
Le quebecois qui resort, parfait 😅
My two most favorites together!!! What a wonderful surprise!! Love it so much!!!
That baby looks like it’s craves blood
You guys have to stop. You're going to actually hurt people.
Ryan has a good French Canadian accent. I'm not curious if he's fluent or it's even his first language.
💜
Why is this so funny??? Jajajaja those little Frenchies are up to weird things jajajaja poop catcher jajajajaja
I've been wondering whether or not she was actually pregnant. I think she made a video about it. If she really did have a baby, congrats to her
Blooooood
Actually, for the first months after being born, the baby looks MOSTLY like the father.  Some mothers get depressed because they can’t see themselves in their baby.  However, this probably has the evolutionary advantage of attaching the father to the newborn.  She needn’t worry—the baby is assuredly hers, and her traits will appear in time.
Well then how did the parents come ?
I LOVE IT WHEN YOU AND RYAN COLLABORATE!!!!  TOO FUNNY 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  I discovered Julie through watching Ryan and now I love both of you !!!! Great stuff 😊
I would have to complain to Chipotle if my burrito was like that.
I now realize how the Ryans in the Ryanverse procreate. Incidentally, that Ryanbaby has a face that only a mother from the Julieverse could love. Also, be sure to save your Ryan/Julie-dollars because Ryanbaby is going to require a lot of orthodontic care!
I follow them both!  Thanks for the collab!  "You should poop more often. I'll try!" LOL
Love these collabs!
Hahahah xD
"He's literally trying to eat my boobs." "I can't say I haven't tried that myself."  I'm dying here.
Her: It hurt all day  Him: Yeah it was mostly in the morning Her: Not it was all day Him: Yeah we're gonna call it "morning sickness" Her:...
So ... Adam and Eve? (If you're religious).
A version of this conversation could have happened around 5 million years ago. Without the part about the baby being from France.
Are you in a relationship with Ryan?  Did you know that he does detergent ads in Canada. Just giving you at heads up....
Spot on. Especially the the last section ... where it seems many still are ...
Best 2 funny Canadians together,...love from USA
They are both wierd , perfect couple ❤🤩
I was waiting for the baby’s first word to be “Blood!”
Was there a "first person to get pregnant" one that I missed?
The baby’s face ahahahahahaha
A twofer!!?? Love you guys!!
OMG the baby Rayan is back..
Won't it be hard to have a crossover of two popular youtubers who make videos talking to themselves?  No, it will be super easy, barely an inconvenience!
Hey Julie, yeah, more of this.  I really enjoy your videos.  I really enjoy his videos too.  Please do more videos with Ryan.
Just here from watching Ryan George's channel.
thank you for all that you've done and continue to do, you're awesome
I liked it before I even watched it.
You have a special effects budget!
It's better to not have a clue when going through parenthood.
YES. I was hoping it would look like that
Auto-like for any video where Ryan speaks French
It's great how similar your senses of humor are. And yet its also weird that you don't have Ryan Georges face. Did you get the Ryan George face vaccine?
YouTube collaboration.  Wow wow wow wow.  Wow!
You two are amazing!!! Love it!!!
We demand you two to make more of these vids
How are both of you so hilarious and so gorgeous? Both. For both. So much.
👏👏👏👏
Ryan's French accent is on point, love it! :)
OMG I wasn’t expecting the ending. Usually I steele myself before watching Ryan’s videos just in case IT appears.  But my guard was down.
You two are such a tight couple. ❤ 👨‍👩‍👦
Doge Army NFTs... You can't funge them...
I think the child attacks her nipples because it's trying to drink her  BLOOD! We know his child is obsessed with that stuff.
So this is when baby Ryan is born...he will grow up to be the first kid to celebrate Christmas.....
I bet you were high when you thought about this skit 😆
Its loud because you are pressa botton on the back.
Great to see you two back 😄
Oh no, not the demon baby again
Ryan is greenscreened into his videos so often that I can't even tell is he's really there or not in this one
Backstory for Ryan’s creepy son! The Ryanverse is expanding.
Ryan really out here representing irregular poopers. Thank you for your service, brother.
That commitment's gonna be super easy, barely an inconvenience ! (I lied) I wonder what mirror Julie would have to say about this situation...
Images of baby Ryan George will haunt my nightmares...
A dumb wrinkly potato LMAO!! 🤣🤣 You guys are definitely onto something with the poop catcher idea! 👍👍
Love you two
Oh god the hell baby is back!
"10/10"   - Me
baby ryan origin story not clickbait
Wait once a week isn't enough?
I'm glad Ryan left his green void for once
holy moly the origin of creepy ryan george baby
Best sketch combo on yt!
Better looking than the Twilight baby. Great video.
Je savais même pas que Ryan était de Montréal c'est pour ça que  son accent est très québécois quand il parle Français.  I didn't even know that Ryan was from Montreal it's explained his strong Quebec accent when he speaks French.
It can't be Ryan's; it never screamed "BLOOD!" even once!
I laughed way to hard at “well good luck with that” lol
You and George are experts in your craft! Love the collabs, everyone involved!
Somewhere Mark Twain’s spirit is smiling! (Reminds me of the Diaries of Adam & Eve.😉)
So that's where all that saved rent money went. I've seen this one before, I think.
This is the cross over we never knew we needed but now can’t live without
This is essentially the premise of the baby scene in The Blue Lagoon.
OMG! 2:18 the babies face. Lol
I wasn't ready to see Kid Ryan again. Even other channels aren't safe.
hahaha you are so crazy guys :D love
BABY RYAN IS TIGHT!!!
Holy crap these are amazing! You two need to do more videos together!
The baby version of Ryan  is so cursed I love it
"You made that over there. I was over here." 🤣😂
What a Friday gift. Thanks!
I love how both your styles are so compatible, perfect for those collabs
Nice to see the return of cursed Ryan George baby!
Love it when you two collab!
A great video about bricks like always!
2:24 He's right, she can't prove anything. She's the only person in the universe who doesn't look like him
So that's why I woke up today.
The CGI baby was hilarious
Ryan George fans complaining how baby Ryan is creepy incoming...
Congratulations on your new bundle of joy!
when they showed the face of the baby, the only thing racing through my mind was "OH GOD IT'S BACK!"
Awesome sketch! Finally the Collab that we dreamed of!
That baby was...something
That baby head!
This duo really needs their own channel, and I'm not even kidding.   Also alternate title: Gen Z Tries Parenting.
Is it morning sickness, or mourning sickness?
obsessed with boobs and nipples? me too.
"You need to poop more" "I'll try" Lol!!!
Super easy, barely an inconvenience
This was absolutely priceless
Oh my f**** god, that's how the cannibal was born, by mixing their DNA instead of the pure cloning process...
Having a baby, it’s barely an inconvenience.
Loved it ❤
That... t h i n g... again.
You two are the best, YouTube, "couple" ever! I hope that you stay together for eternity though avoid any life-long commitments. 😹😹😹   Also discovered your channel a few months back bc of the marriage collab you two did. Now I'm def keeping an eye out for more of these!! 😸😸
This collaboration is moving fast... but in reverse? First they got divorced and married, then a baby and moved in. What's next? First date and meet cute? Will they surprise us and jump ahead to a funeral and surviving one another or other late life relationship thing? Or was the divorce canon and there can be no further collabs beyond that point, only moving backwards in time kind this pair?
my two favourite youtube people collabing is always a treat <3
I really thought baby would say "BLOOD" lol And that would prove its ryan's baby
Super easy, barely an inconvenience
Ah so this is where the boob-thirsty vampire baby came from. I have to say it doesn't look like half a Ryan, but like one-and-a-half Ryan. There's no Julie in that baby's look.
A week ! I managed 2 once! Thought I was going to die!
That comment about morning sickness. I got morning sickness on the bus at like 6pm and when I said that a real woman that had a child said, "But it's not morning..." like I had to be lying....so dumb
Baby Ryan haunts my dreams...
Ah' but you can!
The baby almost looks as good as the baby in Twilight.🤣
Hahahahahahaha
Their dynamics are like Abbott and Costello, you don't expect to see them with anyone else. Well, except themselves😄
Maybe it doesn't speak English...  ^__^
Paternity suits in the Ryanverse are a real b*tch!
yeah respect little person
Best way to end the week, going to the subscriptions page and seeing new videos from 2 of your favorite youtubers. And it turns out those are both collabs!
Ok, new collab pitch: Ryan wakes up hungover in Julie's bed after a hookup. Julie isn't there (making breakfast?).  Ryan feels super awkward and proceeds to stumble out of bed and look in the mirror.  Drunk mirror Julie absolutely roasts him for a solid 3 minutes.  By the time Julie comes back into the room with breakfast, Ryan runs out in tears.  DMJ: "Yeah, I like him.  You should keep him around."
Eve, wtf is that thing?
Like watching two Sims try to figure out childbirth.
I've been rooting for you two
The child is vulnerable.Followers of Ryan,tis the time we strike
Just here to get our Ryan back to Ryanverse.  Thanks for watching him.  Keep the baby.
Sooo ... Now that you have a baby together - that's weirdly cute in a horrifying way, if that makes sense - and ALSO moved in together already ... More collabs? Daily? Twice? Starting today? Great idea! Glad we agree!
being a deadbeat dad is super easy, barely an inconvenience
Once you realise Julie was just in the other room in labour, Ryan's awkward expression in the first scene makes a lot more sense
Not baby Ryan again
The baby face reveal killed me
I got overly excited seeing Ryan sitting on Julie's bed thinking he was going to see a drunk version of himself in her mirror.
Use to tell my wife they aren't human till they can talk.🤪☘
You guys need to collab more, the sketches between you guys are awesome
how are they alive though...
Ryan George is how I discovered this channel. Good to see you guys working together again.
You guys are so damn good together!
Lol I subbed to your channel cause Ryan told me to do it last time you two did this 😂
The first word out of that baby’s mouth:  Blood
Cgi Ryan baby is creepy
Are there more in there?  I asked the exact same question when I was 3.
When Ryan said pretty dumb he pointed at himself lol
Wow wow wow... wow. My 2 favorite jokesters coming together to do a collab is guaranteed comedy gold!
That baby is barely an inconvenience!
I have come from the George kingdom to deliver a gift from his majesty  1 new subscriber (me)
As soon as Ryan said, “I’m glad I didn’t have anything to do with this,” I covered my eyes because I knew his ugly, ugly son was going to make an appearance.
Prior to Julie's arrival, everyone in the Ryanverse was a clone of Ryan. Thus having kids did not exist. Julie has single-handedly destroyed the Ryanverse
So glad these collabs happened!
This makes literally no god damn sense.  If noones had a baby before, how do these two exist to make a new baby?   This paradox is really hurting my brain!
it would have been really funny if adamandeve sponsored this
Collab episodios are tight
I just can't get enough of your cuteness
"Did that just come out of you?"
I didnt think i would see another baby ryan george again 😂
It's like All-Star Game of YouTubers!
I can't say I haven't tried that!!!!!!🤣🤣😍 Respect that little person 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Baby Ryan is still the creepiest.
There should be a sketch 'The first couple to have sex'. Like, 'hey, can I put this in you? It could be fun...'
After patenting his heavy-duty poop catcher, Ryan's once a week crappy life turned around thereby allowing him to have his French kissing breast life.
Coming up next: The first guy to do a DNA test
Aww, babies are tight!
So but... where'd they come from though? Who built their house? Some designed that mattress? Dont they have these questions!?
having a baby is super easy, barely an inconvenience!
I saw the baby and knew demon Ryan baby was going to make an appearance.
The two of you need to holla at CBC and make a show... whatever it may be, it would be beyond excellent.
So sad that baby is going to grow up to kill all those people...
Did not see that twist ending coming! 💀👻 Love when you collab - Canada’s best!
Oh god baby Ryan is gonna be in my nightmares again tonight
Absolutely best. So happy to see you two again. I found Ryan’s channel from yours during one of the previous collab and it’s one of the best things I’ve come across!
I totally ship you two guys
OMG-- my 2 favorite YouTubers.   This is brilliant!
Erster... I mean first!
Came from the first Ryan collab, Stayed for the pandemic time travelers~
I was NOT prepared for that insert shot of the baby. That f*ckin' laid me out 😂😂😂
So… Adam and Eve are Ryan George and Julie Nolke.  That checks out.
I’m done with Russian Dolls, they are so full of themselves.
Julie and Ryan are the two funniest people on the interwebs! Together they are ...   OK, I don't have a clever way to finish that. But they really are the two funniest people on the internet; great to see another collaboration!
Weird seeing Ryan acting against someone who isn't another Ryan
A random comment
Eyyyy my favorite internet couple is back
The Julie-Ryan Relationship Series First couple to move in together First couple to get married First couple to have a baby First couple to get divorced
Omg the return of Ryan's horrific child face. It's truly the stuff of nightmares
"...No it lasted all day-" "I'm going to call that your morning sickness" 🙃🙃🙃🙃 this is the most relatable thing
They get married, divorced, and then have a baby.  lol
Baby be like: blood!
Between this video and the moving in together one, you guys have talked about poop a lot now. I don't know how I feel about that.
What came first  Male Julie Nolke   Or Female Ryan George
Ohhh, prequels are TIGHT!
More Julie+Ryan collabs pls. Both of you rock
Is ryan having hormones?
Funny how ryan didn’t ask where it came from
Well…we know how the first baby turned out… 🐑🍓🪨🩸☠️
This is the exact conversation I was having this morning on reddit
I never thought I’ll see the face of baby ryan ever again
The special effects are near Hollywood level.
Can Ryan and Julie collab more please!? They are so great in sketches together! Btw! The baby was cute in a creepy way!
Typical relationship. You've only earned 72% of what he has earned. (His 1.43m to your 1.04m) Not fair I tell ya, just not fair! ~8^)
I am just wondering why isn't your channel growing up faster. These videos are gold.
'You should be pooping more.' 'I'll try...'
Ah! Yes! My two favorite doppelgangers!!
😂😂😂😂❤so genial!
"I'll try"
No no this is clearly the epilogue to the one on his channel. and he called you a baby and you said infant so you clearly know about children. The lore is not tight.
Good luck to little Rylie
Ryan forgetting the "Extremely close relationships are tight" moment 9 months ago..
Oh my god! The abomination is back!! 😨
Lost it at, "Little Frenchie is into some weird stuff"
That face reveal! Don't let it near your nippels. It thrives off blood! Thanks for the cool video and extra thanks for adding official subtitles. Maybe you could make Ryan consider doing them for his videos, too? They are really helpful for people with hearing impairments and foreign speakers! 💐
I think Julie and Ryan are perfect for each other like dude they got married then broke up then lived together then had a baby it's a whole romantic story I decided
2 weeks of waiting.🥰🥰🥰
Like, done. Leave a comment? A comment like ... You looked great; I didn't even know you were knocked up! ;)
I think you both should make another channel called "The first couple to..." Then just do these video's.   I first found your channel through your colab with Ryan. I am so glad I did!   Now if only Mirror Julie and Ryan could colab. Maybe you are in the bathrooom and Ryan is waiting for sexy times and Mirror Julie comes out to talk to him while he waits.
Dude for a split second I was so confused not hearing an addstronaught and then i remembered I was watching Julie's channel
"You can't prove anything." "Oh but she can...Maury, explain it to him."
Ah blood baby returns
Part 2: first couple to raise a child...
I love that both of their comments on each other's videos are about pooping 😆 Very on brand for them.
The return of cursed baby Ryan!!!
its funny but so true, after bringing a new born home and not sleeping for a few days this is how new parent sound to others.
Haha you two are made for each other!
Pooping is super easy, barely an inconvenience.
adam and eve the first time they get their baby
Jeesus that cgi fucked me up for life. Thanks. Shout out to Ryan for recommending channel :)
WHOOPSIE!
Pooping once a week. I'd sign up for that!
Canonically is this before or after the Ryan George Skit?
Oh god the baby has a beard lmao
Return of the scary Ryan kid hominculus and I’m here for it
That poor burrito shop probably got a ton of bad Yelp reviews for nothing! Another classic baby/burrito mixup
You two have such great chemistry. The first two you did are among my favorites to re-watch and these latest two are great and will join in as favorites.
This was hilarious
That was great!  Love the cute little baby and her graceful exit at the end
WAIT A SEC!! Producer guy got to move in with AND knock up Julie?!!??!! Screenwriter guy is gonna be so upset (not to mention my own personal jealousy)
That's exactly the kind of thing that happens when you're not careful and move in with each other! (take that in whichever order you like)
Hilarious! Great collab. 😆
They still got it! Julie is hilarious and baby Ryan is still making me wanna vomit
We all know the baby's first word is going to be "blood!"
That RJ baby is nightmare fuel
I was not expecting the return of baby Ryan but in hindsight, I have no one to  blame but myself.
You're showing me that having a baby is super easy, barely an inconvenience.    PS I'm a parent - my two are super difficult and a gigantic inconvenience. Their Canadian "polite and nice" setting is broken.  How can I reset it?
OHH LORD I never thought Id have to see freaky baby Ryan ever again but here we are
Please never have a baby with Ryan, that thing is nightmare fuel.
Truly the Dynamic Duo of comedy I decided.
Soooo is this before or after the "first couple to move in together" in the "FCt cinematic universe"? I am confused on the lore.
BLOOD!
The horrifying baby Ryan makes a return!
I'd throw that thing out. They're noisy and smelly, and they refuse to let you sleep
love this
I love you both ❤️❤️❤️
That's like me; I poop once a week, weather I need to or not...like how often I shower, or brush my teeth...both of them!
First time seeing her in regular clothes instead of a bathrobe.
I am really digging these collabs! I also really loved you in Beetlejuice and Stanger Things <3
"I can't say I haven't tried that myself,  respect little person!"
“It’s obsessed with my nipples for some reason.“ “Well, I get that.”  “There you go, it was a French doll.”  I love the awkward energy they have in these skits.
I had just forgotten that scary baby Ryan existed...
Ryan going to Ontario to film this , that is epic , love you both
For a second at the end I thought it was a SOTL vid
I’m disappointed he didn’t drop a “super easy, barely an inconvenience”
“You can’t prove anything.” 😆
Oh my fucking lord that baby is back again
Yeah good luck with that lol
After he said he had nothing to do with it I wish she would have said "but you gave me the burrito"
Live the new vid!
Wow! Julie got a grphics department! I nearly pooped myself... ! OK Julie in spaaaaaaaace next. Jules's does crap Star Trek please!
Julie and Ryan are hilarious together!
So wait... who gave birth to Julie and Ryan?
TERRIFYING BABY RYAN’S EPIC RETURN
With my more than regular bowel movements I thought I had some kind of intestine disease or too much fiber intake. Turns out, I was reverting to a baby stage
Well done!! Thank you.
Okay that baby is terrifying
Oh that baby looks like it just LOVES BLOOD.
One of life’s mysteries solved
Julie: "This thing came out of me, and it really hurt." Ryan: "Really? Something that small? Looks like it would be super easy, barely an inconvenience."
always enjoy when you two collab, great videos!
this was amazing❤️... also, loved the baby 🙃
I hope this is an ongoing series (like the pandemic one) where each time the two of them collab with an increasingly older person and it's first couple to have a toddler, teenager, etc.
More of this please.  You guys work well together.
That baby Ryan is terrifying and hilarious 😱😂
A little comment. Did.. did I do good? 🤤
Such good writing and comedic timing lol  Not gonna lie though... with the imminent demise of Roe v. Wade here in the States, Julie getting stuck with the baby solo at the end hit a little too close to home D:
What a beautiful child. Mazel Tov!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :) :) :)
comedy gold  edit: oh god that's literally the most horrifying thing i've ever seen XD
It's not a problem at all... barely an inconvenience !
First couple to have a baby, yet there are multiple languages already.
They should do a sketch in which they are the alternate reality versions of each other
Is that why you were fat for 9 months
Omg, this is a prequel explaining how the whole Ryan universe was started.  The Ryans and the Julies are one society now, and I couldn't be happier about that!
Oh yes the first man to go buy milk!
Wow, mirror Julie sure looks a lot like Ryan George in this sketch.
I too am on the once a week poop schedule.
I can just imagine Ryan doing "First Person To Be Born" with Julie as the mom. 🤣
Ryan's too busy to raise a kid, he's got movie pitches to make to his twin brother the movie producer guy.  Julie has help from Mirror Julie and Time traveling Julie so.. it works out.  If you guys knew the lore it would make sense in the Nolkeverse.
You two = the best.  Or you three I guess now.
"You can't prove anything" 💀
Is this a distance / green screen / not really in Julie's apartment but made to look like Julie's apartment.....kinda thing?
Aaand that's how Maury became a show.
Oh god, Baby Ryan origin story, before he started eating flesh.
That grotesque Ryan baby is now on multiple channels…
Aww your collaboration is tight!
I just did a search for “Gettysburg Lee talks to Jeb Stuart” and this came up. And I watched it. Bravo, YouTube!
So you are the mom of the kid in that ryan christmas video? I got your eyes
Seeing two creators I follow make stuff together *chef's kiss*
The baby is obsessed with her nipples because he wants BLOOD.
We love Ryan, I came from his channel
Why didn't you use milk phrase , I was waiting you to go buy milk and never come back 😂🤦‍♂️
fave comedy pairing ever!
Ngl I was gonna say that Julie and Ryan would make handsome babies until I saw that monstrosity so I had to gouge my eyes out.
I’m trying to make a “first guy.” Timeline.  THiS DOESNT MATCH
Sounds like a super fast birth. Babies probably gonna have autism.
I love you guys. I watched Ryan's first, shared it saying: they should make babies. Now  I shared this one saying no, no you shouldn't!
Oh.. so this is the origin story of the cannibal child
we have the whole story now... 1- they moved in together. 2- they got married. 3- they had a baby, which Ryan disowned. 4- they got divorced. ------------------ maybe the next 2 videos would be about: hitting on someone you like, then going on a date together.
2:17 "BLOOD!"
"Feel like I always had teeth" and the baby indeed had teeth.
Man, these Dr. Strange Multiverse of madness commercials are getting really elaborate.
Haven't seen that nightmare in a while.
So, they got married and divorced and now they have a child. This is, by far, the best cinematic universe I know.
Next episode, the first guy to ever get a paternity test.
I love when the two of you collab! These two were great again!!! Love them.
Why should they always criticize the baby...
Great to see another set of awesome collaborations between you two!
👏🏾👏🏾 so great👏🏾👏🏾
So glad Ryan did this. I saw one of Julie’s videos a while back and forgot to sub then I forgot her name so I couldn’t locate her. And no my history isn’t on as I’ve got premium and 5 people on the account so for some reason the history doesn’t work …. Anyway I’m subbed now and I hope they get married
This is an interesting collab.
Good Luck with that! You can't prove anything!     - Ryan George 2022
I think you two just wanted to make two videos to see how many poop jokes you could fit in. 🤣 I'm glad to see you collab again.
CREEPY CREEPY BABY
I was not ready to witness Baby Ryan George again.
Wow the story of Adam and Eve is way different than I remember...
Sloth's also poop once per week. They risk their lives doing so.
You guys should ask the collabstraunaut about the poop cover thing, he passes a lot of time in his suit, bet he has something like that in there or something
Lord I love these! Especially the collabs!
Had this on the background, but the dude sounds like Andy from The Office!   Happy friday everybody🤠
One day, life will imitate this art
This is so damn Hilarious !!! 😂
You're both funny.
Collab videos are TIGHT
So imaginative, hilarious, your best, yet
"it's obsessed with my nipples... oh yeah i get that" LOL! great collab!
I liked this I decided.
but can the baby poop in the toilet at the same time as mom and dad?
zęby ma po mamusi
I thought she would have triplets....
What a sweet baby you have there.
everyone looks like Ryan, it's impossible to prove it's his
Its a super inconvenience to wipe soda off my screen after seeing Baby Ryan sorry Ryan its totally yours
I watched both videos. You all work great together. Very compatible comedy styles.
Every first time parent: "It's like a dumb, wrinkly potato, but I also would totally die for it."
I'm glad the divorce didn't stick. I guess when you're having relationship trouble, you should have a small wrinkly potato to fix it!
Wait how are they the first couple to have a babies yet they were literally babies themselves,,was there filler episodes i missed from the Ryanverse,,
These collabs are the greatest
Seriously y'all are amazing together.
you are the best!! made my day...... maybe I gotta poop first LOL
💛❤️💜💚🧡💙
Good to see baby Ryan again
Shipped. Called it on the birthday livestream JulieBug.
Ryan and Julie are my favourite YouTubers and I’m so glad they collabed again!
Ryan sent me
💜
That's not even half, that's more than half which is matter more I decided
I'm so glad we finally got an origin story of King Ryan's heir! Also, I demand to start a petition to Julie do sex education in America
What's amazing is this epiphany I am having that two people who normally act with themselves are also perfectly natural doing a scene with someone else who is not there.  It's a perfect match!  I wonder how long you could sustain a narrative between two people who never share the screen but live together in the story.  What an amazing filmmaking challenge.  Could it be a whole movie?
What would, win a baby or a different baby? I guess we now know
01:09 baby: "Excuse my French." 😁
You should see what this looks like to someone who just entered the empty nest phase of life.  It's even funnier! (Turns out it's not forever, it's only about 20 years!)
I LOVE Ryan George.   MOAR Collab!
The Rylie cinematic universe is tight
So, I have questions. Where exactly did babies come from before this in the Ryan/Julie-verse?
Can't wait to see the Baby grow a beard and keep saying blood.
*sees what the baby looks like*  OH NO, THE DEMON CHILD IS BACK!!! Don't let out get your blood!
just realized they are the youtube vertion of Ryan Reynolds and Blake Livley
I love y'all together!
feels this kinda confirms the whole Clone theory of the ryan and Julie verse. What with never having been babies and stuff.
BEWARE that child is gonna develop a need for blood!
“I’ll try” good luck Ryan!
So is this after moving in ? Or before that ...?
“So, you’ve got a baby for me?” “Yes sir I do!”
"It's obsessed with my nipples for some reason". We can all understand that.
Thank Ryan, I subscribed.
Why would a man in Canada want to be married or have kids? Pretty much all marriagesare not long lasting and have an extremely good chance of ending in divorce.  Men always suffer as the legal system is "fair" so is sides with the woman.  Only way to beat a your wife in divorce would be to declare you're a trans woman.
Such a cute ba..... OH GOD KILL IT WITH FIRE!
Damn it... baby Ryan is back, I really thought we were done with that. And my nightmares stopped just recently!
🤣🤣🤣
Oh my god. Two new videos from both of you? What a day!
I genuinely hope you guys smashed.
Girlfriend: gives birth Boyfriend: "that's cool. Hey babe, looks like we need milk. I'm gonna go get some more."
That baby is straight nightmare fuel
What's the chronology here? The way I saw it, you two got married, divorced, moved in together, and then had a baby.  I think you're doing it wrong.
It's very plausible that all the things mentioned are established yet they're the first to have a child! Life was crazy back then 🤪
Ryan brought me here
Ok the ending just got kinda dark
wow, Julie is getting realy good with her make-up. You can barely tell she is playing both roles
I feel like Ryan should've gone to the grocery store for milk.
Is Ryan trying to be the first dad to leave too?
99% perfect! (1% left because the boobs should be bigger, for breastfeeding) 😁
"it's a completely different vocal registry" I'm dead 😂 Lmao
1:43 can relate
Baby Ryan is tight!!
The fastest click when I see Julie and Ryan collaborate! Did not disappoint, you two are hilarious.
Ein Baby mit einem Kack Fetisch was es nicht alles gibt😅
The mere fact she doesn't toast it in the bin is an example of a mother's love for her baby
I love that the first couple to have a baby and the first couple to move in together are either two separate couples or the same couple and moved in together after the baby and the guy decided baby should be a romantic nickname after his encounter with this encounter.
This would be me for reals. Wouldn't know what to do.
Good luck with that was perfect
Dumb wrinkly potato.  Literally how i feel about babies most days :)
Julie Nolke is tight!
Julie needs her own show.  ...heck, her own channel.  I would watch Julie all day......and adding Ryan just makes it all better
Morning sickness part with great. When my partner had our child her morning sickness was all day. She felt like hell for like I don't know 3 weeks straight. I have no clue why they call it morning sickness because the person is literally sick around the clock and you feel so awful for him because you're like well I guess I did that technically
Love seeing you guys collaborating. My 2 favorite sketch comedy youtubers. :)
A dumb wrinkly potato that I would die for... also seems quite accurate...
fun
OMG! Is this the origin of baby ryan?! Just subscribed!!!
It's really good to see you again with Ryan🔥🔥😇😇⛈️⛈️ Excellent job ⚡⚡💢💢
😂🤪😆
👋👍
I was entirely expecting the horrible deranged baby Ryan but it was a horrible shock nonetheless
You guys are really good at this kinda thing
Coming up next: "The first guy to make a paternity test"
ACCURATE! Also look after Julie or we will COME FOR YOU and not in a sexy way.
Ryaaaaaan :D
OMG DID HE MEET MIRROR JULIE!?
Idk Ryan, that baby has the same beard as you...
"it does look pretty dumb..." XD
I love Ryan's humour and now I am loving yours. :)
i guess it wasn't barely an inconvenience. need more, lol!
Love the two of you together!
The Kid looks similar to Ryan other kid BLOOOD
GREAT VID, LOVE YOU GUYS.
Return of the horrifying ‘baby’. Good luck with that
Very cute bearded Baby.  That's very rare.
Going from the Move In colab to this colab...there seems to be a lot of poop.
Look at the hair on that baby. Majestic.
Julie, are you as funny as Ryan? I'm gonna subscribe just in case.
That's not his kid! She's trying to trick him.  He's Daniel, who gave name to drill. She cheated on him with Jack who named jackhammer!  Daniel, don't let her fool you! 😂  Everyone who see Ryan for the first time:  👀
This genius 😂
I love the idea that in the Ryan/Julie universe, clothing, houses, beds, toilets, burritos, the English and French languages, art, watches, dolls, and the country of Russia all existed prior to anyone having children.
still looks better than the Twighlight baby
Well hopefully the little person won't start screaming blood in the future :))
This video packed a lot for under 3 minutes
Ooooo.. The perfect collab!! 🤩🤩❤️❤️
I feel like the next logical step is: The First Couple to Ever Have a Paternity Test
The origin of the nightmare child.  It's always a shame when two attractive people make an actual monster.  Must've been why they got divorced.
And the award for Best Skit Collaboration on Youtube goes to...   seriously, you two's channels are like cheese and pepperoni, and everyone likes pizza.  EVERYONE
Glad to see my Canadian Comedy skit youtubers collaborating again. I found you originally because of a Ryan Collab ( I keep calling Ryan, Brad in my head, which is why I can never google his name, I always have to google pitch meeting. I mean he had two first names, you think I would be able to remember either of them).
Did that just come out of you? Yep, that would be everyone's first guess!
I love it when this two collab
I have no idea who this Ryan George fella is, but he sure looks like he talks to himself, kind of constantly, and somehow gets paid for it
So you moved in together and had a baby the very same day??
“Did that just come out of you?” I’m fucking dying....ROFL
Loved it !
Join us for Ryan's follow-up video, The First Person To Pay Child Support.
No mother would die for that thing!
That babys face is scary as F**K
That was a great one!
Like a dumb wrinkly potato that I would totally die for, if that makes sense 🤣
You 2 are great together.
I think these collaboration videos are my favorite from either channel.  I'd like to see "First couple to spend lives together".
love it !
Freakin' fantastic.
Stoked to see the return of Little Baby Ryan but I’m a little disappointed it didn’t yell “BLOOD!” That would have been a deep cut.
More collabs!!! =)
Like Adam and Eve.
bLoOoOoOd!
Is this how Ryan's evil blood baby came to be?
They guys 👦 problem is he sneezed and his meatball fell on the floor and rolled out the door this morning but he still ate it. Hence why he only 💩 once a week the last five years. Also he's nutrition deprived because his cereal is only crunch berries and not the full caption crunch cereal.  If you think about it , it kinda makes sense.
"Oh my god it said a word?" "Oh yeah? What did it say? Was it my name?" "Blood!"
Youtube's official couple
How were they the first couple, if they needed to be babies to become people
That baby’s face is where nightmares are made of
blood!
"I bet having that baby all alone was really hard!" "Actually it was super easy! Barely an inconvenience!"
Money is the root of all evil and to make a good economy we need growth. Oh and global warming too. lol
It is just so lovely that you two are presumably friends.
Russian Doll ❤️
When u realise the couple came from another couple
You guys should make a whole community together
I love when these two team up.
Why did that nightmare of a child have to return?
Aaaaarrrrrghh! I never thought I'd see that face again!!! 😱😱🤣
Future Julie should've warned her about this.
Love it when you guys collaborate
ugh can't stand Russian dolls, they're so full of themselves
The whole pandemic wouldn't have been the same without you two. 😄
The Ryan Cinematic Universe just keeps getting bigger
Omg.  So much funny.  I love you both
Collabs are tight!
No.  When I saw the shot of the baby.  It TOTALLY looked like Julie.
I’m here from that other video that I came from. Guess I’ll sub too.
Wait, the walls match in this one... 🤔, and no green screen... 🤔.  Are they telling us something with this collab? 🤔🤔🤔 (or maybe I must stop shipping my fav creators?? 🤣😅😇)
The part about all-day-sickness being minimized as "morning sickness" is just facts.
Baby Ryan still looks better than that abomination from Twilight
THE COLLABORATION FROM HEAVEN IS BAAAACK!!!  :-D
Oh no, IT'S BACK! They didn't burn it, the maniacs!
This was really cute. Nicely done collab. I love watching both of you and you are great together!  We used to call our infant son a Burrito baby when we wrapped him up, so +1 to the Burrito reference.
When the Ryan George verse and the Nolkeverse collide it's like a Multiverse of Laughter.
You are better than him he doesn't even reply to his fans
On a positive note, the little person's medical care is covered.
2:18 Why does that baby have a beard, and teeth?
And just like that, the first guy to ever abandon his kid
The nipples joke bought the hole sketch
I love your collabs!
The Ryan george babyface slapped me in the face🤣
“It’s eating my boobs” 🤣🤪😜
Whoops! Whoopsie!
You guys are moving forward WAY TOO FAST. You just moved in together!
I wanted to guess that, the script for this is written by Ryan, and the script from his channel are written by you?
Burritos are TIGHT
the first couple who got married and divorced: the series
The Ryan-Julie-Baby-Thing looks more disturbing than the CGI-Baby-Thing from Twilight. 🤣😭
Oh no, the Ryan George demon child is back!
are you guys dating
That animated baby Ryan is now my sleep paralysis demon…. Thanks
Hahahahah i love this. I never thought of that before! Who taught adam and eve about babies!
Does . . . this . . . mean . . . that . . . Mirror Julie . . . also?  -C
I love that they got married, divorced, moved back in together and had a baby. True love has no bounds!
Little comment for the algorithm.  This was funny! Love to see this collab
This is amazing .
I was hoping for the baby Ryan zoom and I wasn't disappointed. I did notice a continuity error from Ryan's video when they decide to get together, Ryan calls Julie baby and she says "like an infant" which leads me to believe they have to know what babies are. To be fair, this could be a totally different couple in the Ryan/Julie universe where every other person looks like Ryan or Julie...
I'm 100% sure this is how we started the universe
We got the origen story of Ryan's kid
Ok but how come you guys are not monkeys in this video?
our favorite couple is back and more confused than ever poor things must be hard to be adam and eve
Poop catcher - lol
Laughed out loud on suprising cameo of baby Ryan.
you cant prove anything lolol
Omg, this is the origin of the cannibal child
Dang Ryan is such a cutie
0:56 Ryan, you're killing me. 2:17 And he's back, baby!  Literally.
This could be a whole series. The many many stages of not knowing what Is going on.
The goats together again. Best day ever
You guys make great videos but I am always DEEPLY disturbed by any video that isn't Ryan talking to himself or one of his dozen identical brothers.
C o m e d y
It is so funny to see him in her bedroom.
you guys really are fantastic.  more of you two together please!
Babies are humans in their larval stage.  You're welcome.
2:14 😂😂
Most terrifying face ever
And so he left to buy some prehistoric ciggars
Woah, it’s the origin of the cannibal child!
Well... I'm never eating another burrito.
Great collaboration, again. Next: Heading over to Julie's channel.
ngl This was low-key awesome.
No, not that baby again!
2:18 Let's all be honest here. We knew that was going to happen.
that damn cursed baby.. just please not him..
that's how Adam and Eve felt... Imagine the horror when they saw the belly button in the little dumb people that came out of Eve.
Return of the demon baby
A VERY confusing moment indeed! There's no way that baby came out of you! Storks deliver babies so no way that came out of you.
Wow Julie has gotten soo good at impersonating men now, like yeah it is still obviously her but it's just impressive what good acting and a fake beard can do!
OMG!! This is golden funny!
I love you two together. Your stuff is gold.  Keep doing that thing that you just did.
Dead beat dads existed back then too. Nice to know.
From married to divorce to moving in to having a baby together. Or did they have the baby before the divorce?
Their chemistry is super easy and barely an inconvenience
And here I thought Julie would upload a _'The First Couple To Ever Move Apart'_ -video. Since... the married/unmarried-videos with Ryan.
I love your colabs... I think you should move to the same place and made the life of the other a little worst. but the videos will be great!
So now we know the origin story of Ryan's demon child.   And I assume the demon baby was the reason for their divorce.
I love how their styles combine when they do a video together
In a sense these collabs are like you two's babies.
So THIS is how Ryan clones are made...
Ryan has a history of making the most horrifying children/babies imaginable.
Liked just for the bloodthirsty baby Ryan
Good one, you guys!!...
So this is why they got divorced!
The birth of the ugly child.  Love it.
02:17 OH-NOO... the birth of blood-baby...
Why was his first thought that it came out of her? Weirdo
I was like "how are they going to prove its his kid too when the bit is they didn't know what babies are before now?" And then you showed the babies face and I died laughing.
baby ryan is definitely not scary.
Always a treat to see such Canadian royalty together in one video 👌🏻👸🏼🤴🏻
Can we please, for the love of God, get a Netflix show with Julie staring in it! Please <3
Baby Ryan is Dope😂
2:18 baby Ryan comes to haunt us ones more. At least it looks less disturbing now
Top shelf.
Ah! Lol for last joke
MOAR
Ryan's french accent was perfect imo
I just really love Ryan and Julie's collabs!
It's okay, Ryan is just going to the store to get some milk, he'll be back.
That face made me laugh out loud. Love these collabs!
Once a week?  🚽
MY TWO FAVOURITES!!! Love it !!!
I'm pretty certain this is what all new parents go through when having their first baby. Kudos to them 😅
Wow, Julie's gotten quite good at pretending to be a man. Bravo.
I can totally imagine "Poop Catcher(TM)" being a huge success as a trade mark.
Lets face facts here:  If those two ever decided to have a baby together, the world would implode with cuteness overload! 👶🏼
Ryans are taking over they are changing form and they are taking over..................
There is a small chance that baby will want blood And Ryan and I will become a king
I almost wish he would have started making dad jokes unexpectedly
Man that was hilarious! Can't wait to see the first couple have a paternity test 😂😂😂😂
when two awesome people join "the force". love your work
Damn you just moved in and already had a baby.
Respect little person 🤣
"Like a dumb, wrinkly potato."  I've been thinking that for years.
Baby Ryan George lives to scare another day...lol
Baby ryan George still the scariest thing I’ve ever seen to this day
LOVE seeing baby Ryan again.
Better than anything on SNL. Great stuff. Love of them separate and even more s a team.
I’m gonna start calling diapers poop catchers now😂
Funny
happiest moment in 2022 seeing two Ryan George videos at a time.. especially its his series with Julie
Amazing as always! Love both of your content
This adds a lot of lore to the RCU: Julie is the mother of Ryan George Jr, thereby making her the first queen, the mother of a cannibal and the woman to marry the first guy to celebrate christmas
Fantastic hop at the end
So, this has to be building up to the grand finale of “First Couple”, right?
Don’t worry Ryan, it will be super easy; barely an inconvenience!
No other comment, this is 🔝🔝🔝🔝 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Didn’t know Ryan George could speak French. This just made my day ☺️ I am now a happy french canadian!
Babies are super wierd, there's still plenty of jokes that could have been in the video. But I get it, the skit can't be two hour long. Although I would watch it.
Yay!! It's always a good day when my two favorites youtube comedians are making a collab!!
I don't think I'd trust Mirror-Julie to be a reliable baby sitter though...
... they are very dumb.. as I have 2, I can confirm
that baby was frightening
"You should poop more often "  Yes that's super easy .... Barely an inconvinience
Looks like the birth was super easy, barely an inconvenience.
That is a forever thing.  Poop and all!
Blue Lagoon 😂
As a frenchman, I must admit that Ryan was quite good for the french phrase.
Match made in heaven. I may start stalking you both until you get together irl, like the Reylos did to Adam Driver. Except I'm on another continent. So just... I dunno. Imagine that you see me occasionally and I shout things like "you should totally get together with that guy you sometimes make videos with!!"
Oh gods what horrors is that "baby?"
I'm astonished at how well Ryan speaks French! His pronunciation was on point!
baby Ryan isnt real he can't hurt you   baby Ryan: BLOOD
2:18 that's the origin of baby Ryan, good....... please kill it
Ryan George and Julie nolk introduce the return of the demon baby
Love it 😂😂😂
AHH!! WTF! Come on man, my Nightmares are ruined!
God I love you both.
And here I was thinking my babies were ugly.
Next up Ryan and Julie go on a double date with Julie and Ryan?
I was sent by The Collab-strnaut.
I'm imagining a mini skit with mirror Julie "its a good thing thst little person is yours and not mine" "yeah.  wait what, why, what do you mean?" "well because... well you know!  obviously... uh what do I mean?" *drinks a glass of wine *
Ryan doing his best black guy impression XD
Julie and Ryan together is tight.
2:17 I jumped so hard that I dropped my phone 😂😂
I know y’alllre Canadian but the timing on this is nothing short of predominant
Once a week tho
Ryan looks like he's craving some cereal or like a glass of milk or perhaps a trip to the grocery or gas station
what a beau.. uhm nic... uhm  it's a baby - i guess  definitely got your eyes julie! glad to know who it came from
This is troubling because the first video I saw Julie Nolke in was the one where she was divorcing Ryan George. This poor hideous baby is off to a bad start.
Wait, pooping once a week is not normal?!
First couple to have sex. Boom.
These two are pure gold everytime the do a sketch
I came here from Ryan George  channel 🥰😂
Oh my. I can't unsee baby Ryan!
But wait so they stayed together and didn't get  a divorce. Like no harpoooning thing anymore? That's great.
Haha the return of demon spawn Ryan! 😂 I love you guy's collabs!
Ah yes, they upload a "first couples" video at the same time again. In a year they should make another two.
My favorite part about Julies videos is that they're funny when I watch them.
Mygahd the return of Ryan's cursed baby 😂
No, I do think Ryan has something to do with that thing, he bought the burrito for her, after all.
Thanks you two crazy barstewards.
“I poop like once a week” “That’s - you should be pooping more” 🤷‍♀️”I’ll try”  I’m dead lmfao
That baby kinda looks like it reeeally likes blood.
Julie sorry but someone have to say it to you, your other costumes are fine, but this man version is too fake, we all can see miles away that is you in disguise, you need to make it more believable.
You guys adorable together
Having a baby must be super easy, barely an inconvenience.
Oh, God.  The origin of Ryan's nightmare child.
I aver that Ryan had nothing to do with that little human.
Love you both. You make this collaboration thing look super easy, barely an inconvenience.   The comedic chemistry here is tight.
That was the most action packed 2 minute video I’ve ever seen. You two crush together bravo!
The kid is from the hot person who lives 3 bus stops away
Maybe when he grows up he can become a producer and buy Canada or something.
Actually this is a good training video for child services to know when they need to step in.
Two of my favorite skit channels together~ Woo!
Absolutely hilarious!
I love Julie's concern when he said he only poops once a week 😂😂😂
“Blood!”
These two together again at long last. Amazing
Lmao "you made that over there! I was over here!"
Ok so apparently Julie is the mother of the cannibal kid in Ryan verse. I dont know how to feel about this.  EDIT: btw I really love both your channels. More collabs FTW :)
Oh damn it! And thought we'd finally see Mirror Julie with her new beau Mirror Ryan!! I mean you could have asked them what "that" was she was holding? 👶
Absolutely love this comedic duo! Y’all’s marriage and divorce videos were terrific, I’m so glad y’all collabed again.
Oh no the nightmare baby Ryan is back
Both of my absolute favs.
It has returned...
This is what happens when you don’t clone people
"you can't prove anything." best line.
I am with Ryan on this one. You can easily find hundreds of people that look like him.
Where's Maury when you need him?
"It does look pretty dumb"   He said of the baby who shares his facial features.
Damn, Ryan really said "I'm gonna go get some milk real quick"
This is the beginning of the human species according to christians.
I was snickering throughout the video. You know, I had the same questions as a four year old when my younger cousin was born :’)
So, not just the first couple, you guys are the first humans to produce. Basically, you guys are Adam and Eve.
Ryan George brought me here, your content made me stay
Ryan's cannibal child: The origin
1 million subscribers 🍾🎉😭
Oh YES, it happened!  Ryan is back on screen, took him time to gather necessary confidence, but let us command him for getting through 🤣 Big thanks to J&R for answering the prayers of millions. Plus a lovely story idea ❤
for the last 2 years, I've been getting your notification while I was teaching (11am my time) and had to wait until later to watch. now that I don't teach at this time, here I am. at 10am this time hahahah great video! you're awesome!
Russian dolls, lol. And I think little people is the preferred term for people like the munchkins in Wizard of Oz
Respect little person 🤣
Love these collabs! @Julie Nolke and @Ryan George are my favorite youtube comedians.
they are filming it separately cause they fear that if they meet in real life their chemistry will overwhelm them and they will make a baby for real. and move in together. and marry. and divorce.
Baby Bloodlust Ryan returns!
at least half>?? LOLLLLL I am like which half looks like Julia I wanna know??
Ryan and Julie would have amazing children together I decided.
Wow. The, uh, timing on this one. Feels pretty relevant, like you mighta planned it that way.
You two give us the most awkward power couple portrayal and I love it. Like overly conscious trailblazers lol
Love how hilarious this is
“You should be pooping more. I’ll try.”
Okay, I like this because it’s funny and relatable as to why I don’t want children… but if I see your channel or Ryan’s showing us this ABOMINATION of a kid ONE MORE TIME… There will be blood shed.
You two are peak YouTube comedy. I love the collaborations so far!
oh my god when he tells you "good luck with that" I FELT THAT MORE THAN I HAVE EVER FELT ANYTHING including the birth of my children because they were c-sections and i was under anesthesia. hey, first person to get a c-section might be a fun one! "well this baby isn't coming out the way it's supposed to, we're going to have to DISEMBOWEL YOU to get it out, but don't worry we'll put your organs back in and stitch you up after"
"Well that finally explains why you put on so much weight the past nine months... Even with all of the vomiting."
As usual, comedy gold..  I found Ryan's channel through her previous collaboration with him.  He has really funny material too.
The video on Ryan George's channel was made with a green screen but in this one it really looks like he's sitting on your bed so now I'm trying to figure out if that is actually super impressive editing or if he was actually there
home run!
That infamous blood drinking Baby Ryan, he's made it to other channels too...
Julie delivers again!
Her videos are funny when you watch them!
OMG, you guys are great together.  Loved it. So funny.
nice
I literally said on Ryan's vid this is going to lead to nightmare babies  We must all pray to whatever gods we believe in for mercy since clearly the end time has come  Personally I'm going to a brothel
You two are fantastic individually, but together you're even better. More collabs, more more more! :)
People are asking what came first, the chicken or the egg, while I'm here like "How is this the first baby to be born?"
It's so bizarre to see Ryan and Julie interact with other people, we're so used to seeing them act off themselves! 😂🤣
So then Ryan and Julie are Adam and Eve?
The cursed baby Ryan returns!
No comment other than thank you for making my week.
These collabs are great! I hope you and Ryan do more!
2:19  AAAAHHH, I thought we were done with that abomination!
Ryanverse has evolved, I wonder how Ryans discovered this phenomenon.
So wait does this one or the moving in together sketch come first? Because Ryan knows what a baby is in the moving in together sketch but they are living together in this one.
Are those 2 supposed to be adam and eve
🤣🤣
"Air you go, air you go, it was a french doll" Bruh
Now we need the baby's perspective
This sums up my birth experience 🤣
Oh no! Baby Ryan is back to haunt us... Great, I'm in.
That baby Ryan is gonna be giving me nightmares
Fantastic. 👍🏼👍🏼
Ok so the timeline becomes - Moving in, Marriage, Unexplained little wrinkle potato, Divorce.
Noooo! They brought Ryan’s demon baby back from hell!
I couldn't tell who the guy was because his glasses hid is identity well. I had to do a lot of research, then I looked at the description.
So this is how little diabolical baby Ryan came into the world!! Wow! Wow! Wow!
Live ur colaps!!
Two of my favorite YouTubers together again.  Laugh out loud funny punch line.
And thus the demon baby of the Ryanverse was born!
Is this a repost?  It seems so familiar.
I think the two of you would have really funny babies... Is that weird to say?
2:18 I'm 100% confident that child will grow up to be a mass-cannibal
"Maybe it's just too dumb for that." LOL. I fucking died with the skit.
Love the collaboration, just wish you guys were in the same room. Way too many edits.
The revelation of his face moment was brilliant xD
I would always die for dumb wrinkly potatoes 😂
Trying really hard to poop more often ☹️
We finally get to see the origin of Ryan's little demon child!  It does have a mom!  And she would die for it.
Finally, an answer to the question, "which came first, the people or the baby?" The only thing missing to make this video absolutely perfect was baby Ryan thirsting for blood!
Yessssssss baby Ryan is back ! Be careful with the nipple he feasts on blood 💯🤣
And we all know what this wrinkly potatoes first word will be.  "BLOOD!"
Baby Ryan has come back!!! The horror!
Infant with facial hair 🤣
Baby Ryan is back 😭😭😭
Why do women always think they are not pooping enough?
Man, Julie has gotten so good that she could play 3 characters at the same time! One of them being a man!
These two are a match made in YouTube heaven. Kind of rude to leave the other one out though.
That was SUPER FREAKING FUNNY and as a new parent, yes, it does seem like a forever thing 😆
I like how the two videos are connected. "Baby like infant?" Then this video comes out as I'm watching that
And then he proceeded to say i feel like we need some milk. I'm gonna get some milk.
Adorable kid!!  Congratulations on figuring it all out!!
Great to see Julie and Ryan collaborating again. The first couple to get married/divorced sketches they did was how I discovered Julie and her channel.
"It doesn't look like it's offended" 🤣
is it tatoo or smth on her right arm?
*The "Nolke verse" and the "Ryan verse" are both the only multiverses that matter*
Child birth, super easy, barely an inconvenience.
Little comment!
Wow you two are all over the place in your relationship. You got married and divorced on like the same day, and then got back together to move in and have a baby so fast...
ryan led me here
Definitely respect that little person for trying to be obsessed with Julie
546
no more sex for you guys. FOREVER
The collabs-tronaut send me here and I didnt regret it.
Hell yea, more lore for the demon baby
Well at least you know the baby's favorite food... Blood!
Best collab
I love these collaborations Julie & Ryan together in one perfect video 😁
You and Ryan are always a fantastic collab ❤
This is the best Canadian content on YouTube!
"I think this is the burrito I was talking about" - AHAHAHAHAH -  FOOD BABY - i'm crying at my desk.....
Glad to see another collaboration. I found Your page last year (at least that's what my pandemic self from last year reminds me) from the first collaboration.  YOu two are comedy gold together.
Fun
I lost it when they showed the baby😂😂
Next up: "First Couple to Show up on Maury"
LOVE it!
👍
Name a more iconic duo
Respect little person. Respect.
I am thinking way too hard about this sketch.  Like how do you guys have clothes and such a nice house if you gave birth to the first baby. Lol
This happened after the divorce... Murphy Brown gives a thumbs up.
2 Collab videos with Ryan and Julie in 1 day is tight
Creepiest baby ever, loved it
Petition to rename diapers as poop catchers from here on out
🤣👍
Adam and Eve but with a twist.  Love it!
My favourite collaborationssss😌😌
643 views and I JUST got notified?
Let's go Notification squad!!!
more of the collab we have all been waiting for!
If this is the prequel to the divorce one then they figured out the terminology for children pretty fast with the word kids at the end of t
Ummmm actually. There couldn’t have been a first couple to have a first baby in this modern of a world, you can see from the infrastructure in the background
You guys never fail to put a smile on my face 😁☺ Edit : Mom am I famous now? 😂 I won't tell that but tq for 500 likes 😘

The comedic duo.😂😂😂
ITS MY 2 FAVORITE YOUTUBE COMMENTS IN 1 VIDEO!!!
Good content
These "1 day ago" comments are freaking me out!
The duo strikes again 🔥🔥🔥🔥
It's an amazing thing when from just the title you can tell that Ryan George is gonna be involved
Adam? Eve? The second one is going to be a real handful.
Well that was fast, first you guys moved in together, the next thing I know, now y'all have a child!
Yes! Loved your first collab. Excited for this one
I'm amazed we continued as a species after the first couple of babies had to be cared for.  I would've just ended our species right there.
Thanks to the established existence of burritos, pooping more than once a week should be super easy, barely an inconvenience.
Hilarious!
So much poop talk. 😂👍
Little Frenchie's into some weird stuff." Love it
@2:17 Yes! Return of Ryan's "OMMYGODWHATISTHATTHINGCANTUNSEEITKILLITWITHFIRE son" 🤣
Ah, unfortunately Julie, this video has already been done before, many years ago. https://youtu.be/yqz4JETekYM
"you can't prove anything" - I spite out my coffee so fast on that one
I assume you were working on this way before the SCOTUS leak? One could imagine this "comedy" sketch playing out in real life all too often in the years ahead, ugh. SORRY didn't mean to bring people down. Um, puppies! Kitties! (And Ryan as baby was inspired.)
You two are the best!
