W vid
Chunkz goals be cold tho..
oreo
brudda the intro was sick🤣
I’m hearing that Kane’s pen has finally landed🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇫🇷
2:21 Tobi Said Yet And He Was Right Lmao
Tobi carry’s
So the pro premier league goalkeeper is twice as good as a Sunday league goalkeeeper
0:46 DONE DIRTY TO CHRISMD
Chrismd could play against ben foster
"I've seen unborn children do better."  Reply to this comment saying whose quote this is
Nah John is just a good keeper
Is the dude that wearing long sleeves and pants Kai cenat?
Big john
utr boys are ballers
Crystal Palace 🤯💀
Chris is better than you so you can't speak lol
Wasn’t Toby with the blue shirt in love island
Release the stinker free kick video with harry
Why did he make Chris so short in the intro😭😭
Bro disrespected Chrismd
Sunday league is so bad😭
Why is minister socks both different size
John clearly faced more difficult shots
Ben Foster is an amazing goal keeper, the age is just hitting him the same way it hit Josh.
1:29 Chill with the camera switches
Kkkk
Fatzinga is terrible
Why is Harry shirtless
What a goal from simon at 9:04
What a save from Jhon at 8:36
Any YouTube title with professional goalkeeper in the title, immediately means Ben Foster.😂
likesao
6:45 "fuck me with a two foot dildo" Chris killed me 🤣
Editing on this is on point!!
Chris smol
This video just didn't work but still great views
Football is the best
iT WASNT THAT GOOD OF A SAVE :/
Chris should’ve gone against Ben Foster
This was average sorry minter
chris better than most the "pros".
Im Sorry but this video Honked only because of the idea, 10 Mins thats all lol
😂 wait.. what.. Chris? With a 2 foot what?
It's so funny when they say a premier  leauge goalkeeper when his team is relegated
isn’t that toby from love island
Is there any way you would consider doing a football video with a couple fans maybe?
Those high pitched screams are worse than on a pre school playground when uncle Jimmy was around🤦🏼‍♂️
🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
Actually love how u ended the bid lmao 😂😂
Tobiiii 2:10
watching this after we lost to france🥲great choice of top simon
0:31 if you know you know
lolll
Shouldn’t post this Simon has just made a show of Crawley town
Is the goal keeper alisson
Ahhhhh I wish my mate would of been in this video
Lightskin Tobi actually hit that ball so hard it travelled in time back to 2013
Is it just me or did the sunday league player and goalie do better than the pro players and goalie?
Behzinga got fat again?
I loved then in the intro when cal and Chris were really exaggerated sizes I just knew who they were going to be 😂
Is just me or does Ben foster always volunteer to be videos to enhance other YouTubers
Behz getting that dad bod
Harry being shown as a “ stinker “ now is so sad. He really was a good footballer back in the day.
I would've kept harry in. He always makes football videos entertaining
What’s that show that they showed with the guy with the bowl cut hair and he said sorry lol
The part when it hit ksi😂
ironic he’s wearing a french jersey. mans predicted france > england 2 days before it happened
So no one heard chunks hit that note on the “go” part when they were counting down to start???
30 seconds in does anyone see anything else???
So both keepers can save most shots on target, the difference is Ben foster can catch the shots to prevent more dangerous attacks in a real game
I think we are getting old funny(fat) Behz back!!!
Such a shame a story line is needed. I wish you invited them all and called the video : kick out with the lads
Absolutely devastated after tonight's match 🥲
minter eating a france shirt 🤦‍♂️
i think as a 13 year old keeper I can save most of those shots but on a smaller post
A actual match goalpost is bigger than this right? Actually wondering
Some of bens saves makes me wonder why he retired
honestly if simon commited to becoming a professional football player he could
Why is Harry just casually without any shirt though? 😂
Simon why are you wearing a France shirt that's a bad omen 😭😭
I didnt wanna say this but isn’t it just blacks vs white at the beginning 😂😂😂😂😂😂
anyone realised simon's socks against ben foster 😂
🔥🔥🔥
need more pro players in videos
we need a noah beck vs chris vid
Shoutout to the editor, works amazing
Foster in smaller goals it’s easier for him
Ò
10.1 M For this?
Even when JJ’s not in the video he’s still in the video😂😭
I just wasted 9 mins watching some clowns not even be able to land a shot on the goal
WHY CHUNKZ HERE FFS?
i  can't  believe  most  English  players  are  gay  ...no  real men
Hahahaha the Chris md animation was so funny 😂
These video is decent but the levels between chrismds football videos and everybody else’s is very big. Shows how good chris’ vids are
0:41 how i already knew the little one would be chris
I wanna see boys against girl goal keepers and vice versa.
The pettiness of making Chris small
Congrats on #2 trending
Yes more football!!!
Wow Simon has friends
Hi Simon! Can you do reacts to the World Cup? Would love to hear your opinions on the games/ players.
All my black brothers are ballers
Dead video
Good fun content keep it up🫶🏽
Croatia WONNN!!!
We can always guess who the goalie will be
John is actually class for Sunday league
1:56 perfect opportunity for harrys mum edit missed
Simon that white kid cool enough to chill with the black kids
When I saw the little man silhouette, I thought it was Greg the spanker.
if we lose to france its simons fault for wearing a france shirt
One of your best videos recently. Big love from a day one fan. <3 keep it up brudda
Chunkz is an absolute baller
Beta squad editing 🔥🔥
great video only if my ears werent gone from you lot screaming OUUUHHH after every shot lol
Is that toby guy the dude from love island?
6:45 ayo
Kante is white?
We need to see the 10 minuetes of freezy harry and chris
Damn both the dads didn’t score
GOD BLESS
Idk who the other tobi was but fuckin hell he’s a baller
chris is zesty ahh
Hi
Class video
I love how harry was just casually there with no shirt
Saw Harry in a recent video taking 50 shots and scoring bangers vs Harry in this 😂😂
Props to the editor 6:38
Chunks wearing trainer socks n daaat madnesss
chunkz has tekkerz
Hello
Who invited Micheal Owen at the end?
I hope this was filmed when it was warmer cuz Harry must be crazy if he’s wearing no shirt in this weather
Best editing I have seen in a while frfr
I think if another side sidemen charity match comes around we need ben and John as the goalies 😅
love this editing style
Since the Ben footage was old one, here’s new concept, Retired Prem Keeper vs Active Prem Keeper
I think that if they took a touch before shooting against foster they would have scored more then they did 🤷🏼‍♂️
Behz again out of shape? Or is he's belly glad to be in this video?
It’s not bad and I feel he should be proud of his body but Ethan is gaining his weight back🤥
I know I’m late but why Simon wearing a France kit 🤣🤣.
Hi
hi
wasn't that toby kid on love island or am i tripping
Who remembers when Ethan used to be a baller 🥲 labor finished him
Absolutely love Chunkz carrying the squad
How old is this video sidog?
Thumbnail- left half is his bottom right shot run up, right half is his to left shot run up. :) Fuck I've watched way to many miniminter football vids
we love this vids but bring back one word interviews
I want to see a video of just Simon vs Ben Foster. Simon’s striking it actually class
I was just watching the vid and at 2:47 when Tobi scored a finesse I got the notification for ksi tweet which said 'this is unbelievable, lol ". The timing mannn😲
Should try a Sunday league vs a proper Sunday league keeper know, get him full lol
loved the memes
Simons Editor😂😂😂
Chris Md so overated
Did anyone notice simons socks
Simon just an idea but maby next time use the same players and compare the keepers just so it’s a better comparison because it’s now based if player skills but over all great video
Harry being pissed when he realises that he spent over an hour filming just for nothing
Chunk is so good
This is overedited I found it hard to track the ball as the camera switched so often
The JJ and Deji screaming clip never gets old, all these years later I still laugh out loud when I see it 😂
Manny sucks so bad
John is too good to be called Sunday league
Who was the lightskin with manny tobi and jed
Why did they take 2 touch against John and one touch against ben? Should have done the opposite
Wow original 🥱
1:57 was expecting w2s mum
Simon… a football video… what year is it ???
6:44 a dildo half his height? Dangerous...
Actually love seeing Jed in videos he is so class!!!
The camera angle set up convinced me that chris is the best fooball youtuber.
Is no one gonna talk about that finish from chunks…. Geeeez 👏
Surely it should have been the same players shooting each time…
Who edited this😂 its…
Video idea train with hashtag for a session
Better title: Black v White
All this needed was some bog
All this needed was some bog
Whoever edited this needs a pay rise
Cripsy editing
80% of the shots weren't even on target , didn't even showcase the goalies cause they legit can't shoot at net loool
The editing here is amazing!
Can you reduce the frequency of changes of camera angle
A weirdly specific comment, but the field where they film with Ben foster, is that the same place where JJ filmed with Juan Mata for Rulem Sports?
Ethan shouting in the background will always be my favourite thing about these football videos 😂
mr beast video
Ben seems to move only when he as to compared to John who was bouncing around
banger video but am i the only one annoyed with the edit? it cuts everytime it gets interesting to a different angle
The editing is sick man keep up that hard work Simon 👌👌
And these make football content 😂😂😂😂
Raondomending
hold uppp is that toby from Love Island
Bro what is up with the editing. There's so many cuts to different angles I can't tell where the ball's going half the time
Sorry just gonna say it, chris’s footbal vids > simons
Miniminter video = Chrismd video Not saying bad but just vibe I get
Chris md stinker as usual
hi
This video was kinda hard to see because it was in chrisMDs shadow
Chris was wayyyy too tall at 0:44
1:56 That edit finished me 😂😂😂😂
If John’s your Sunday League keeper then your in a good place. He’s fantastic, surely plays non league on Saturdays ?
song at 4:26?
W video simon.
PLAY MORE FALL GUYS
how much can i be paid to be a ball boy in these videos? 😅
1:58 the OGs know😭 love the editing!
Uuuf banger
Big Spoon 🥄
France top uno
stinker
chunkz is good at football
FINALLY MANNY IS IN A SIMON VIDEO.
Lol it's crazy how all of the fathers in this vid can't score😂😂
Banger
Ben Foster didn't conceed the most goals in PL history for nothing
it'd be so cool to see a video with both keepers together and see them comment on each other
people can say what they want but Simon is the best footballer on Youtube alongside Theo , Manny and Chris
John is the best Polish goalkeeper out there, yes even better than sczesny..
Loved the jj edit😂
Simon needs to do a video with Aj shabeel it would bang 😅
Ethan man come on
"he scores that every day of the week...but he doesnt though" - chris Dixon
i would have loved to see more of the low league group if they had 20 more minutes there would have been so mad goals
2:49 said every gk ever
A MINIMINTER FOOTBALL VIDEO COME ONNNN
.
No one gonna bring up what Chris said about the 2ft dildo ? 😂
ALLAHU AKBAR
Sup Simon im a young keeper who lives in nyc, would love u to come here to shoot on me boss!
Damn you lanky ❤ much love
I thought the British were supposed to be good at this
Banger
other tobi is a UNIT
Nice video Minister :) W
Chris "you are My daddy" Where is Noah hiding??
Anyone else thought the recording with Ben was really old cuz of tobis vid
Love these vids pls post more
So many camera cuts bro
Love the editing and format of this vid 😂❤
I wasn't watching at that exact moment but when he said " the stinkiest" it was obvious who it was going to be😂
Simon wearing a France kit what a sin
bet this was edited by w2s ;)
John is a lot, lot better than your standard Sunday league keeper btw 😂
You are the goat
0:43 I already knew the little guy was gonna be Chris 😂😂
Miniminter Football Videos are ALWAYS GOATED!!!!!!!!
Someone said chunkz paid his cousin to let his shots in
I thought I’m in ChrisMD video
One sock high one sock low is that you yeah
Amazing football skill for an 30 year old Simon. BTW I can make this joke I'm 27
"how does a sunday leauge goalkeeper vs pro"  its kepa vs casillas
john W
Yes Simon! More of this please
This is what we want
Idc what anyone says miniminter is a undercover footballer
Get me in one of these vids and ur guaranteeing an extra 15 goals
Congrats Simon, just saw it on your podcast A day late but happy 10th anniversary on YouTube. One of the most consistent sidemen with top tier entertainment. Love your videos and well done on your success over the years. Keep it up, we love to see it
uploaded a video he created months ago wow
Thanks simon
Football vidss😍😍
I think Harry would say the launcher is on the wrong side
The fact that this video is 6 months old bro
Great conclusion from the vid😂😂
Who else is sad Ben foster doesn’t play for Watford anymore
*kicks it right to ben* everyone: "omg he just caught it"
the intro was all I needed to watch haha
a miniminter football video yayyyy
Very much a mr beast format for this vid
I’m dead 😂 the end of this video is too good 😂
Chris said what 🤨🧐
Chunkz is the Ronaldinho of the YT footballing world. The man plays at his own pace.
Chris mad influence is crazy
Santaaaaaa I was only a child U took me in ur sleigh and took my innocence away😂😯
Chris GOAT
This was awesome I love football videos 😊
Ngl John is a great keeper
What a pointless video😂
The editing keeps getting better and better! Great video
Only og's would know the last turf they played at
The editor needs a raise
Ethans that guy u let play because they own the ball😭😂
THE STINKERS EDIT IS HILARIOUSSSS HAHAHA JUSTICE FOR CHRISMD
ChrisMDinho every 1/10 shots
broooo the background when playing w behz, chunkz and chris brings back memories of old sidemen football vids
Shout out chunkz man😭😂
has he hired beta squad's editor?
Simon the best YouTuber regardless?
Are you gonna be at southside tmrw
🐐🐐
Woahhhh, Simon you're a traitor, you've posted this vid at the wrong time, you're wearing your opponent shirt
MINIMINTER LETS GO
Chris is trolled too hard
can we appreciate simons grind
Mr Minter, you’re consistency is out of this friggin world omg
these guys really be saying ben is catching everything while kicking it to him 😭
Black team vs white team😭
0:30 I have seen that video before, looked different though
Toby from love Island broo
man firmed this in summer and uploaded in december
How long did this video take to come out if watford were still in the prem bruh
If this was recorded when ben was still playing that means tobi wasn't called up for Crawley yet
6:45 chris is not who he used to be golly
Hi miniminter
Chris is always catching strays
Miniminter with four videos in a month, lets goo
Don’t want to be rude but this is poor from you
So many harsh cuts
Come get ur within an hour pass
A France kit Simon…😂
dead
Loving the content Simon! When's the backyard pitch coming mate?
6:45 what?
Simon, I think I speak for most of you viewers and fans if I say that we love football videos the most. They are always great
Ben actually makes “The goal look small” it’s incredible
22 min early
Gaaaaas
🐐
Quality video
"bro he's so long"- simon minter 2022
This video HONKS.
Warra Video!
wow its minister
My guy did chrismd dirty😂
2:43 Shinroller from Tobi
YouTube’s best footballer has returned 👑
Bro y u still uploading?? U got ur 10 mil now, I would’ve been offfff
I love how Simon used to cringe at the name “Si” in fan fiction stories and now that’s basically his name from the boys😂
Looks so easy, would love to try
great content!🙂🙂👍👍👍
Should done more camera angles ANNOYING
How could you post a video as bad as this?
i click the video and theres bog without a shirt on im DEAD
Am i the only one who noticed ben was retired when tobi and manny trained with crawley town😮
Here in 16 mins
Big up Crawley
what a goat 😊
violated chris again
ben foster is on fire ( i know hes retired)
Didn't expect it would become fatball
This pitch is memories
Swear I've not seen freezy in a football video in ages
Chunkz's goal 🤩what a finish!!
Video is a bit short 🥺
Mr. Minter, this video tickled my brain cells
Good video but it has to much of editing
Keep up with the amazing work Simon! Much love ❤
Absolutely love Chunkz carrying the squad 😂😂
Brother the editing is too much
Behzinga getting meaty again. Back to the old days huh
Chris has got so sus
The edits in this vid tho. Hilarious
Put tobi in net
I reckon if Simon played and trained every day since he was 6 he couldve been a prem striker. The way the man strikes the ball for a non pro is kinda mad.
Poor video he has got some of these shots out of previous videos
This was too much fun! 🤣
Love how no one else has noticed Tobi from love island (and Hashtag United) is in the video
i love the commentary of simon. Especially the intro 😂 😭. Need more football challenge vids
