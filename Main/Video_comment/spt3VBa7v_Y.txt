Rip jota
This kit made some history
Best kit for liverpool
I'm searching for the shorts of the kit ✌️ i can't find it on the internet. Any ideas where I can find/buy it? YNWA  🤔
One of our best away kits, it was so clean
I miss this kit so much and I miss the 2021/22 season as well, shame it didn't finish the way we all wanted it
Didn’t show the full kit
Well...gonna make it the 1000th comment to celebrate this iconic kit!
This kit will always be remembered as the one, when we thrashed Man utd. by 5-0 at Old Trafford.
La camiseta es hermosa!👌 ahora, porque a los inchas nos venden otra cosa?aparte de ser muy costosa la prenda,nos dan algo de menor calidad y menor diseño.es muy injusto
I liked it and I bought it.
😻
Good Jersey LIVERPOOL
The 5-0 kit💥
Dri-fit Adv one is so hard to find bruh
Hermoso uniforme
Best kit ever
This will be an iconic kit in 10-15 years time as it will remind everyone of the 5 nil at old Trafford. The same way the grey 08/09 away kit is iconic
why i can‘t buy this great shirt‘s?
Psg jr
the clothes are nice, i want to have them but i don't have the money😭
Less bad than the red/orange one
Sold out everywhere
amazing!
Top 10 us in top 1
0:14 where can I buy this jacket?
I'm a United fan but it... just... looks so... *smooth*
That away kit is class 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
0:05 That thumbnail 😂😂
The beat man is fihaa
This is why I wanted Nike to produce our kits! Even non LFC fans are telling me this is the nicest kit in the PL this season by far! Bought it as soon as it was out. Hope Nike keep this up!
NB
liverpool is a legend liverpool is the meaning of football
It’s not the kit that matters, money goes to owners.. it’s the efforts from staff & players that makes the respect for the team and it seems that the reds are a team without a soul now
what did you guys do 2016 on Wijnaldum why now Boss Jurgen Klopp,Peter Krawietz,Vitor Matos, Pepijn Lijnders,Michael Edwards,William Spearman,Greg Mathieson,James French,Mark Leyland,Harrison Kingston You didn't see and buy #29(FULHAM) ANDRE ZAMBO ANGUISSA
Yeah,this one is sauce,here is my order please!
Lovely❤
This is the cleanest away jersey in a long time man... sesssssh straight drip
Woow lovely 🥰😍
Вооооуууу🔥🔥🔥
0:15 who!!!!!!
lovely
Can't wait to get it one
Glad to see the full collar back.
Roma cabang enggres
our best nike shirt so far but...... a POLO SHIRT ??!?!
i'm stoned
That's cool
bobby with the drip
Cool.
Come on lads! Let's be champions of Europe again and for the Premier league come on can't wait
Perfect
I, as a big fan of Liverpool FC, recommend that the club bring in new players who can replace WIJNALDUM, namely CALVIN PHILLIPS.
Yaaas
Fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Pagla.badly need this kit🤩
i love it, unfortunately that’s not the same fabric that arrived after i preordered it :/
This Away Kit is it Blood!
Can't lie even as a chelsea this is a sick kit
Best kit 💯🔥💥
Still waiting for salah to sign new contract
Si fueran Adidas fueran campeones de premier
อยากได้มากๆครับสวยจริงๆแต่เงินไม่มีคงอดแน่ๆเลยครับจากแฟนลิเวอร์พูลจนๆคนหนึ่งที่ thailand ครับ
Won't change the fact it went Rome🤣🤣
Nice
Beauty
The best away jersey ever made with a collar like gucci love it
Where is mooooooo
bangers from salah and mane incoming with these kits on
Damn…
Love it😍😍😍
Can you send one for me?
Can we plz get our NB kit back
Pretty awesome kits!
That away kit make me start thinking about that 2013 Liverpool away kit
must buy this away kit
i love this clup what a kit !!!!!!!!!!
YNWA
Hey hey how mo is not in this video
Mo salah pls
I love it!!!
Yoooo that blazer is so dope !!
Gareth bale: stop right there. I’m in.
Nicer than the Home kit... just 1 opinion
Why this is free and the first training is paid!!! DISGUSTING!!!! There is a limit for business and money!! This club is all about  the fans!!
buy camavinga, the player has great potential, and he is still very young
I like this more than home kits
👍
เท่
Renato Sanchez will look good in this kit!! 🙃 21/22 make it happen!!!!!
There both terrible
New Balance was much better
Don't like the coller, other than that, nice top, reminds me of the late 90s cream carlzberg top.
COME BACK NB! This stuff is atrocious!
Cakep
Ditch Nike ffs, Warrior and NB were better
Firmino 👍
Liverpolo FC
0:05 sponsored by some magic in Doctor Strange
Now I think that we all want Renato Sanches and, personaly, I want Silas Mvumpa, Barella and Otávio, even though Otávio plays in my city’ club and vê did a good season
Looks like Roma away kit from season 2020-21 :/
When the away kit looks better than the home kit😂😂😂
The best kit we had in many years
Beautiful kit I love it very much well done Nike x Liverpool fc👍👍👍😊
🔴🔴
Not a fan of this design.....dont like white kits......reminds me of Real. I'm a retired graphic designer...and Id like to know who's designing kits these days. Most all are atrocious....they seem to be ideologues that have forgotten what looks good. Take last seasons bus seat designs...diamond plating. Oh the genius.
i don't like NIKE
wow not bad
മലയാളി ഉണ്ടോ
It is very cool. Still, made with forced child labour with no real salary, in communist China. I don´t recall where Adidas make their stuff but New Balance does the same as Nike, just in Vietnam. Also, Nike is the wokest of them all.
20/21 as roma away
Beautifull ❤❤❤❤❤❤
As our kits are getting worse this is such an improvement
*'definitely gonna buy that shirt.looks cool to wiped,washed & cleaned my toilet floor with'* Thanks liverpool 🤝🤝🤝
Sallah and Mane not in this video scares me…
bruh aint a liverpool fan but loving the ad
I hate footy shirts with a collar. Looks so conservative and doesn‘t match with LFC.
Cmon
Sheeeehhhhhh that soo cool
golf
ok jujur aja ya.. design nya bagus..  warna nya BIG NO bgt
Where mo salaaa ?  🏆🏃⚽
Where is mo salah
Salah to PSG
oh its so bad
Please get new players to win Champions.
Anyone got a link for the beige jacket Gomez is wearing?
best kit in the PL by far
WOW Y
look at that drip
Judging from leaks that they got the home and away kit correct, looks like we know what the third will look like
we nees the champions  and leage  plaes  jurgan make it another time  pleas  al team make it
💓💓💓
Just, beautiful 😍 I can’t take my eyes off this beauty 😍😍
Welcome back liverpool 👏
كفو
Nike hate us. Absolutely rank kits
Liverpool keeper kit???
I'M GETTING IT FIRE FIRE 🔥🔥🔥🔥
An actual kit that has excited me in years. Certainly smart 👌
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA
Last year Roma's recycle pattern. Lmao
Kingsss
As much as excited I am, scary to notice Salah is not on this commercial. 😓
💦
Sign some players.
This is insane
Damn Bobby drippy 🥶🥶
Liverpool 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Es perfecta 😍
😍🤩🤩🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍😍😍😍😍
Can we get Konate content please
Who gives a s...? They will be like every other Nike team except different colors. Nike makes the worst gear.
Keren
u.... nice.... this is more like it... retro...
Sheesh
Sick as hell
Better than Home .. can we switch?
Ueid
Belo uniforme! Mas agora quero ver contratações pontuais!
I AM TÜRKİSH, TÜRK VAR MI ALOOO
Dieu merci beaucoup
I’m trying to love it but it really does look like someone got a polo shirt and stuck a Liverpool logo on it 😭
For me the 19/20 kit can’t be beaten.
If they made it w/ white shorts it would be PERFECT.
Away kit was desinged to make you buy the home kit. ^^
Football highlights 🔥🔥
That last girl is very pretty......who is she? 🤣
Yeah, my go-to Polo shirt.
Nyc👌
Firmino making things wet
It kinda looks like a rugby kit ngl
like this
Наконец тооооо NIKE !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Слава богу ....
This kit is awesome
GOOOD
😍
Roma crest has changed
Please embroid the LFC logo. Please. Don't cheap out on these stick on logos.
I'm a United fan from malaysia ,liverpool away kit really awesome
This team burnt-out very quickly
Below average performance by NIKE 😕
I'm something question mbape go Liverpool , konate and sancho
Why Jurgen Klopp won't let Muhammad Salah take free kicks
This kit is 🔥
Looks slick
Best team ever  Never walk alone 🔥🔥😍
Sheeeeeeesh 🔥🔥🔥
nah nothing special. but it's still better then the last one
im still confused, what about players who singh contract personally with another brand, like salah with adidas?
RO-SSI-YA!!!    RO-SSI-YA!!!   RO-SSI-YA!!!
or buy Robin Gosens ,Hanstuber ( Defender )................Sergio Busquet ( Midfielder )................Haaland (Striker )
or buy Jules Olivier Kounde ( Defender )........Nicolo Barella,( Midfielder )........Gabriel Jesus ( Striker )
please buy  Donnaruma ( Goalkeeper )....Saul Niquez,John Mcginn and Adama Traore( Midfielder )....Harry Kane( Striker )
so ugly the new kit
For some reason,i found these away kit cooler rather than our home one
Firmino could become a model
2020/2021 Asroma = Liverpool 2021/2022
96/97
Dreadful kit. Looks like the Nike designer ran out of ideas and chose to copy a design dated back to the stone age. I guess this kit is to appease the boomers.
I think the blue 1 was better but its nice
Na not feeling that colour it’s like a beige or a cream. Just stick with the plain white seriously.
Show the 3rd yellow kit that’s nod to 1980s 🔥
Is Joemez’s jacket available too?
Did Bobby not go to the copa america
AS ROMA KAH?
At first sight it looks so stunning ❤
Fun fact:Jurgen Klopp  used to be a football player
Jude Bellingam in liverpool plis
This is mad
it so nice bro omg LIVERPOOL FOREVER!!!
Nice
Doodoo folicles
Best ever away kit we´ve had in my opinion. Would have been even better if the name and number were in red
We could play in potato sacks as long as we don’t get any major injuries. It’s a nice away kit, for the record.
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
Serious question. I was at Anfield a few years back with a mate. Before the game, we had these mad oily cheeseburger across the street from the stadium. Anyone knows if the burger stand is still there?
🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
This new kit is  so cool I'll wear it on my wedding ceremony
The shirt looks like that of the corinthians do brasil from 2020
Just wow
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Sadio mané allez gaïndé
Very good kit
Standard chartered will forever be an ugly sponsor logo
Looks cheaply made
Don’t like it at all
love it 💪🏽
Only decent kit so far with them ,we really need to get away from Nike if we want a kit to be remembered ,so far in 2 seasons with them overall i say a 3 out of 10 and that is only for the income otherwise id say a .
Better than The home jersey
Sheeeesh the drip 😩💧💧
meh I'm not sold on it to be honest....
When yall see the third kit👊
Wow 😱😱
Oh f*** no. It looks like an england shirt. Sack Nike now!
Horrible, all my years of being a red. Nike comes up with this? Nonsense
Amazing kit! One of the best away kits I've seen. Probably second to the 15-16 Black away kit with grey lines
Liverpool i love youuuuuuuu
Where is my beautiful Virgil?
As a Tottenham fan  I actually like that shirt 👕
This away kit not bad, definitely not to be missed
Where is the king of Liverpool Mo Salah
ordered my konate one sheesh
Beaut
IM GONNA BUY IT SOON!1
That is shocking
Ugh.  I hate collars on kits.
I hate collars on Football shirts
I LOVE IT!!  😍😍
This jersey bring back us in the classical football era🙌👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Just Wowww
Joe Gomez? I've literally forgotten about him, hopefully he has more play time in the new season.
small club
The best away uniform  I want to wear it every match
What a kits amazing 😎😲😲😲😲
Waiting to see Renato Sanches in it
i need it
New away kit looks way better than the AS Roma style home kit.
Better than home kit this season
Liverpool be the red 💥
That's pretty cool
😍😍😍😍
it actually looks pretty good, honestly anything is better than that black kit last year
eh, its just ok
i love it
English National Football Team😄
Hopely van dijk back in the New season
PSG Away kit ?
I'd Buy this!
🌷👍👍👍🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷
Absolutely rotten never seen worse
NICEEEEEEEEE
🔥 nice kit
I thought it was Chelsea away kit
Sheeeeeeesh them kits be busen bunsen
The away kit is hard ngl. It's exactly what Liverpool and Nike need to do. We are trying to make the club and it's merchandise fashionable so people across the globe will wear it just anywhere. Just like Barca, Bayern, Juve, Real and PSG are.
Keren..!!! wajib beli 🤣
I love it
นั่น...เสียเงินอีกละ,
More a holiday attire than a kit. Man where's new balance?
Looks like an england football shirt !!🤔
Best kit
I don’t like it! It’s ugly, who chooses these outfits? I didn’t like last years outfits neither! Nike needs to step up their game, it is to important for Liverpool to have attractive outfits!
as always ... Nike is so ugly ...
Descent and how perfect fits to jota.
Bobby got it ⚡⚡
Nice na Liverpool
Make this the home kit asap!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
i don't know where does Liverpool got the inspiration from of making a New Jersey
Where do mo salah 😢 I miss you mo Salah😥❤️❤️❤️
I like that!
woow
I want it all
Omak sus

I just can't wait to buy this one
Coool
Love you 😘 liverpool

โคตรสวย
Cool
I fucking hate Home Jersey 😤😤😤. Is there anyone else who is with me.
The away kit is lit🤤🔥
Better then the home kit
Unremarkable.
Where is Salah?
But I like this one too
Chelsea's kit is better than this
I am a chelsea fan so it's a okay
CLASS
Why no Salah, Mané, Virgil in the promo video ?
Cool
Home kit is horrendous, this one is amazing
Where is mo and sadio ? Come on mannnn
Es que no puedo ser más hermosa diosssssss que belleza de camisetaaaaaa
wooooooooohoooooooooooooooo lets goooooooooooo
Looks like a pissed stained bed sheet 😂
Beauuuutiful!!! 😍 But  the Expedia sponsor gets in the way if one tries to customise the jersey with UCL patches. 😢
I also want one  I am from Pakistan Lahore
LFC need a proper young striker
فين أبو صلاح يا بشر 😖
It's a shame they continue to be sponsored by such a morally bankrupt company.
no special injury kit for Alex-Oxlade?
Better than the home kit for this season...
Groooooss. Buttons are for polos not playing kits. Colours and textures looks great though
Ok Nike!!
bagus ini bisa di buat harian keren ada kerah nya
Mo salah is the best player in the league English history
Mo salah
The vapor kit always looks better and of course, the players make it look good too!
Very god kit
I'm Brazilian and Liverpool🔴
Love 😍 and support from Pakistan 🇵🇰 especially mo Salah 😍😍
Adidas miss you
good jersey 👍💪
Yo That is so nice🔥🔥🔥
Pls do konate first day at liverpool.❤️
this kit is leng
Its nice actually ima buy it is fire
Jersey always look the best when we win a lot in it
Nice.   I definitely want sum.
Pls get new signings...we need at least a midfielder and attacker this transfer window as man u and man city are legit playing fifa and are getting so many signing ,so until we get something...we are pretty much doomed......pls sign someone...I suggest that we go for renato sanches for mid and next year mbappe will run out of contract so we should try our best to go for him and get him and surely offer him a big wage
🔥 🔥 🔥 edit: Mine is arriving Monday with Fabino on the back ✍
What a kit! 👏🔥👍
Amazing 🤩
The drip is levels yano 😍🔥🔥
فين صلاح يا ليفر
Mine arrived today(oh the joys of living in Asia)  and it’s exceptional!! Amazing colour mix and material is so nice!
I don’t know why everyone loves this so much. I’m a Liverpool fan but the shirt makes me think I should take up golf
Now,i'm waiting for 3rd kit
It’s clean , but Nike need to step up the game , Adidas is smashing it rn , we need to be like Dortmund, make a statement with the kits alone and the transfers cause at this rate we will be lucky to get forth
Okay that is fit
🇮🇪
E eu invoco os Brasileiros  👇🏼
Where the hell does the blue come from ?
Bobby firmino look alike a boyband...
Decent 👏🏼🔥
Amazing kit  From Liverpool fan
Can’t wait to see Bobby doing a no-look screamer at Old Trafford in this kit
Me just buying the old three days ago WOW THATS GREAT.
🏳🏳
Sheesh This kit is a banger
Nike must do better I'm sorry. The home kit looks awful with the orange detail and the green collar on this is just as bad.
Meh not a fan of the colour but who cares if we win something In it
While I loved last year's away kit, this one is more like it.
We are Liverpool.This cost's more.
Yes!! The kit looks nice.
This look sleek👌❤️
russian flag? rly?

Shessh
Apik pol cok
sick kit
Waaay better than the home kit. Finally Nike provides something good.
No sallah no Mane ? Does this mean something ?
2019/2020 nike jersey design still the best
Better than home jersey
I can't see a difference from last season's away kit of AS Roma
well let's talk about how much we missed our gomez
W
where can i find the jacket gomez is wearing?
Sweeet!!
This jersey just give me Gucci vibes 😜😜😜😘😜
Who else would be suited for the "CELEBRATED IN STYLE" either than Sinor Firmino ?
Keren😍
This kit is Van VVD's birthday present from Liverpool 😜😜
wow, very cool
Happy birthday Big Virj❤️, can't wait to see him wearing this kit.
Hey admin, I just want to tell you that we still have Gini on your YouTube banner :(
Hi.. i malaysian
Cok ful
Let's see some new signings in it aswell?
This kit is absolutely stunning!
I want this kit 😍
The third?yellow?
Can I get one
개예쁘네
Hope we don't play tennis on the football field with this kit! Nike needs to hire real football designers rather than have them designed in third world countries! 🙄😑😏
I m waiting for Van Dijk
This looks good best kit this year definitely I will buy it
Wayyyyy better than the away kit and the turquoise abysmal mess they had last year
❤👑
We drippin
UNITED cant even compare with our kit, they have sancho, we have the away kit
I hope this *away* kit will get *away* with the premier league, champions league and the FA Cup
For the present the new away kit feels special.
A dark green away kit with the same colour combination would be interesting in the future ..
Best away kit for years this!!! ❤️
Mantab jiwa....
I’m a Spurs fan and these are incredibly nice 🤝
เเชมป์🏆🏆
I like it, first time for everything
かっこいい！！
🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩

Aq wingi bar tuku online, iki jek nunggoni tekane, tak kei jeneng karo nomer sekalian ben rodo gaya kekinian.
They wanna make it a polo so people can buy it and wear it normally. Marketing
สวยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยย
This is just a masterpiece!
Lots of detail.. Looks pretty tidt to me!

Lebih bagus daripada home kit
Cool kit

Waiting for the PL, and the away one is more loveable the home one.... More elegant.
Ahh yes i am excited !
Jota ♡♡♡
*Fun Fact:These Kits Are Made Up Of Recycled Bottles!*
Nice
Our home kit should just be this but in dark red
Shut up and take my money
Nike is like, It's okay for normal clothing at Home but we must have good attire for outside ! 😁
Mohammad Salah will Surely Look Good In this Awesome Kit🤩
_I gotta admit it, this is_ *FAIYAAH!!*   Read: *"FIRE"*
Not bad👏👏👏
hot
Epic shirt all
Looks like the boys are going on holiday, this kit won't strike fear into the opposition. Shanks must be turning over in his grave.
🔥
Trent alexander arnold,I am a 13 years old teenager. I am a big fan of you and all the teammates.pls tell them that I asked them.pls
Won't lie.... I miss the old ADIDAS and even New Balance kits. But hey, different strokes for different folks.
🔥🔥
Sign more players please, only then I'll buy this kit then I'd ensure whatever money I spend on any LFC merchandise goes in transfers. Kit's got a nostalgic feel to it and it is smart enough for my everyday outdoor wear as the white colour helps to combat the South East Asian Heat.
This is what i call a nice kit!! 👍🏼
TOP
Diolgo jolta hihhihihi
Cheap plastic poliester? :)
All club's: let's be stronger with a new signings   Liverpool: away kit will let us win the champion's league

Got mine 2 weeks ago. It's very nice. Got the 3rd keepers shirt coming tomorrow as well with Alisson on the back. It's black
Littt When Firmino Wears🔥🔥
Best kit from nike so far
I don't man. Doesn't look that appealing to be honest. I mean there's nothing flashy about it. 🙈🙈🧐🧐
Waaaaayyyy better than our home kit
Love it!
That better be red not orange
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
AMAZING, I love it!!
Walaweyh 🤯🤯
The only one from somali 🇸🇴🇸🇴🇸🇴✌☝️💪

Bruh looking like a school uniform
Brillant
Oh bhai sab op in the chat
Can we wear this at home too???
Shut up and take my money already 😭🤤😍🔥
We are Liverpool  This means More YNWA 🔥🔥❤️❤️ Let's go for Treble next season 💪🔥🔥😎
This kit is absolutely fire🔥
Were the laborers paid for making these? Or were these produced in typical Nike fashion?
Looks like my granddads polo T.. Still sick tho
Looks good
❤
Last years away kit was just next level funky This year's is just effin classy
Finally a serious kit from Nike
Polo shirt
Imagine a new signing like konate revealed the new jersey 😂🔥
Ecru color right?
🔥
the boys with this kit at UCL final please 🥺🙏🏿🥺🙏🏿
Waiting on this Konate signing to be loud and proud with an offical video
이건 사야해
Kit is fire 🔥🔥
Finally some effort from Nike
Roma copy
Is it just me or is it that this new kit is kinda THICC.
this is the best kit so far no doubt
SHEEESH
Very niceee
❤️
ganteng maksimal
Nice kit
I absolutely love this tbh and I've been slating Nike. I'm not going to buy it because the prices a beyond ridiculous and the money all goes into Nike's pocket and not Liverpool's anyway. It's criminal they charge so much for something that costs so little to produce. I digress, class kit and I like the home too
so I will be buying away kit this year
Finally a Liverpool away kit thats nice
This is got drip 🔥
Liverpool is the best of the best
This is a sick shirt wow. Well done 👍
Love you salah
This kit is 🔥
Class.
This is actually a really nice and classy kit. Really like it
Not bad
best kit I've saw in years
wohoooo!! the best so far i think!! gonna check my wallet first..
Sign some players
Those opening shots of Trent and Jota 🤯
The new drip😍
Nice
Love it ❤️
Looks fantastic
Awesome jersey, do think without the polo fit it would of been much better. Will be getting Davies on mine
It is a beautiful
I am so buying this!!!! 🤩🤩🤩
Away kit is just🌠🤤
not gonna lie, not a huge fan of the collar
Absolutely awful. Bring back new balance
8,5/10 🔥

Famm this is fireee 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Im gonna bye it
That away kit to me screams YNVWA
Pros it's a beautiful Jersey 😍 Cons my children 😂
Gomez was the flyest here
This kit is 🐐
Looks oldschool-ish... Me likey... alot!
This kit is fire, but not a big fan of that collar.
Very very fine touch 😍
NOW THIS IS A BLOODY GREAT KIT.
This is the best looking kit I've ever seen...period
feels like a test match jersey ngl
anjiir keren ..  auto nunggu grade ori thailand 😅
im on fayaaa🔥🔥🔥🔥
Great looking kit! I like that Nike has picked up the white and navy combo. We had some great fortune away from home with these colours during our winning season (1-1 vs Man Utd, late 1-2 turnaround win vs Villa). This is a cool update!
Goooooood!!
Let's goooooo 🔥
Today Happy birtday Virgil van dijk🥳❤
So good-looking. Damn.
cleeeeeeaaaaaannnnn also bobby dazzler looking fresh af
WOW
Wow

It sucks big time 🤢 🤢
Nice one Bobby
Our away kits are always amazing, but the Home kits Border is disgusting
Joe Gomez really very handsome

Just hope that the yellow isn’t that checkered one and it’s the one with the stripes instead
I'm brazilian in love with liverpool, what a shirt that wonderful robe. Let a lot of titles come this season. WE ARE LIVERPOOL
It super cool. And it goes well with the city culture 🔥
