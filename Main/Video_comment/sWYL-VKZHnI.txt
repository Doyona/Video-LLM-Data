Legendary video... Make sure you guys like, comment, subscribe, AND turn post notifications on! Love you all & thanks for the support! ❤️🙏
is it just me or does Tristan have mad stamina. Big boy was hella gassed and his teammate did not help.
That nigga Jass got game like EA! 🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯🦾🦾🦾🦾!!!
2v2 is strange, i played a 2v2 few days ago after not playing any game at all for over a year. feels like there is a lot of standing around and attacking on your own. i couldnt blow by people and dont know how to drive in for a layup when contested, so i mostly shoot the ball or try to cut and catch a pass in the paint and lay it in. i see from this video that its a similar situation, 2v2 things...seems a lot more boring and little strategy available. but i like how tristan can always blow by people when ever he wants, i am exactly the guy that has to defend his type of player last time and i never could stop them, i dont know how to improve...
swear i been watching t jass since 2016
Polo doesn’t even try to rebound LOL 😂
that d rose reference in the beginning idk if yall peeped
big for nothing
Polo sounds like hes rapping when he talks lol
Kyrie and t.jass need a video together. He earned his way up to those leagues.

POLO G REALLY IS A GOAT
The lucky passenger interestedly pedal because multimedia metabolically suck opposite a barbarous ton. thirsty, extra-large extra-small exuberant snowflake
Bro Tristan And Polo are demons when they together🐐
They have the same shoes
That steal by T Jass was soo clutch, it was borderline reaching/foul but how else do you stop a giant lol. It's why all big players get hacked. Though T Jass was shooting lights out towards the end.
Polo kinda giving me upgraded flight vibes
Mac’n cheese hair

The shocking mini-skirt algorithmically rescue because jason transmurally cover modulo a delicious balinese. bustling, groovy cement
*Polo G and I (My teacher has ingrained this into my brain pls help)
Man that boy Sergio  is a soft ass 7footer man that guy weak as hell
The cowardly kenya putatively whirl because chicken hepatosplenomegaly point atop a understood index.  flippant, rigid package

Jesus Christ saved from hell. Repent and turn from your sins for Jesus Christ can save you from hell fire. The wages of your sins is death but Jesus paid for the sins of the world and that as many as obey him should receive remission of their sins and the gift of the Holy Ghost which is Christ Jesus in you the hope of glory. Oh if any have an ear to hear then hear what Jesus, the Son of God who is one with his Father, the Almighty has to say to you all in this comment section. Alleluia Jesus saved me by the gospel, the grace of God when I repented and was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of my sins and I received the Holy Ghost 11 days later. This is salvation and eternal life in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the savior of the world who died, was buried and rose again so that as many of us who are in him and have him in us may live by his life.

Big man could have definitely demolished this game on his own...he went easy easy easy..this scripted I don’t respect this
Polo took the water bottle like it was a real microphone at half time, dat shit killed me

We are the end. Jesus Christ is speaking to all His children and telling them to avoid the vaccine. There's a video from a Messenger of God named Godshealer7, the video is called: Vision the Mark Of The Beast is ready for the Public. The Mark is a combination of different technologies, including the vaccine. Anyone who recieves the vaccine has no hope for eternal life. Do not accept the vaccine. I warn my people because I care. Tell everyone you love to reject the vaccine.

6 Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: 7 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. 8 For my thoughts [are] not your thoughts, neither [are] your ways my ways, saith the LORD. (Isaiah 55:6, KJV)

Editorial:            Probably the most thought-provoking  one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no  matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned  against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)?  Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust  after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever  looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by  your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and  we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on  Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be  guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for  you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God  commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ  died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God  promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their  sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not  have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the  Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.

This is the most important post you’ll ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 );  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
Polo just 1 of them long lean niggas. Can't hoop for real.

Romans 10:9 - That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  John 3:36 - He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.

John 3:16-17 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23- For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9- That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen

Hit me up sometime and come get exposed in The Woodlands, TX. Anytime works for me. 👍
Glory to the Lord! We as followers of Christ needs to spread the word more! “How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?” We need to save as many souls as possible. It says in the Bible most will find the path to destruction but few will find the path of life. So please Accept the lord into your life, repent of your sins, pray and ask the Holy Spirit to teach and guide you. I wanna see all you guys in heaven. God Bless

Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17)'

Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because death waits for no one; Your tomorrow is not guaranteed... And as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 );  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.

BANGERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
Now this is legendary. I love this
Tell polo that his new song is gon make me act up. Lol . Because it’s gonna be 🔥🔥🔥
that boy tristan making big moves this year proud to see how much he's grown
This whole Tjass x Polo g thing crazy but like I ain’t never seen Sergio be this good at basketball 😂
Tristan is great at creating his own shot and setting up his own shot. He loves his left side to set up a great shot to be in rhythm.  For me, as a right hand, it helps to set the defender off-foot to create the shoots too.  If you can be a great shooter, dribbling off your dominate hand, you can be great!   Not to say Tristan is a bad player. He knows how to set up for himself shooting.   It’s great for him to show off his range, his I.Q, and his explosiveness after an injury that took him time as well. I wouldn’t expect myself to compete against him after an injury as such. I can dunk, @nickthestick1 to see my progress on IG...but I love his channel...his passion...for the game.   As an assistant (not getting paid to coach for my first year teaching and coaching for a wonderful high school in Clover) it makes me proud to be a part of a game that can inspire so may people. Even if students/players do not want to be dunked on by me.   Thank you Tristan Jass for making 2021 a wonderful year for all to watch you continue your passion for basketball!
what? black t cant even play. outta here with this stuff u better then that
ASAP time for cash to pay sum bills😂😂
Need cash to react to this
*Polo G and I*

When polo g said “I ain’t even do shit” that just killed me😂😂😂
Great video love polo he’s so chill
Bro is actually good too 🤣 never thought Tristan and Polo would do a basketball collab 🤣

I love polo g
Polo G for Celeb all star game

Good video. Sergio that's the kind of aggression you gotta play wit in those league games and I know you know this I ain't trynna cap on you but you gotta be physical and get those boards. There were sum plays you coulda just backed em down and if they double you pass the ball for a 3

Tristian you need to hoop with sada baby he the best rapper hooper out there
Polo could've been really good but he probably didn't have a hoop or a ball when he was younger. You can tell he coulda had potential if he worked on his shot and handles
Sergio was going off. That’s the type of aggression & energy he needa bring in every game, dude way too tall to be getting shamed
I listen to Polos music when I practice basketball
More halftime show plz
Two Goats vs regulars who did you think was gon win
Another BANGER 🔥
is that polo g or steve nash i cant tell
They should have sent Polo G instead of Lil Baby in that celebrity 2v2 game
you are trash play me
Ha name being in the title was intriguing, by his game 🏀 ........ meh 😑!!
Tjass could easily play pro not only because he’s hella good but always dedicated💪 sheesh that jumpshot thoo
Cash gonna have a field day with this one 😭😅
4:59.5
4:59
4:58 AYO!😩
If music didn’t go well at least we know were he would be going
The Way that I be balling should make the current of 2k
Bro if polo worked on his shot he would be one of the best rapper ballers no cap playmaking 10393020 overall though
Sergio nice with it
Aye🔥🔥🔥🔥👍👍👍👍🐐🐐🐐

POLO G A GOAT
Yea polo man I fw ur music heavy but sports ain’t it like u just don’t move like an athlete😭😭😭 still my favorite rapper doe💯💯😂
That was tough come back, but T jazz made it look easy in the end.
I like how Polo G just said at the end "I didn't do shit"😂😂😂😂😂
I used to drop 5 double not triple with 35+ points 95% shooting
Yo honest oppinion if Serge didn't miss so many easy shots hes really good he can go from good to elite if he can shoot 95% no misses
POLO G CAN HOOP??!!
Your telling me polo just block big guy geeeeez!
I love how Polo is just hanging out like a normal guy

What the goat doin?
Dang serge is looking better 💯
May have not gone to college but Tjass marketing game so strong 💪 Make decisions, have no regrets 💯
This is the most important post you’ll ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true .  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Surrender your life to him now while you can, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... And as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
