To compare Marco's content and his style of humor to Bobbi's is really off to me. Like, Marco actually has personality...is funny...and has timing and precision with how he interviews his guests. Conversations are actually had...they get to promote still...like, the interviews execute on every level. Bobbi just be like, sittin' there and leaving the guests just dangling. It's like, she be waitin' on them to entertain her idea and then she just goes with it or something. It be boring. It's like she be tryna exploit them but it all just backfires. No hate, but whatever I guess. Marco interviews you can actually rewatch a few times.
😂😂 “you’re a good baby”.
What city we in? Alabama 😂😂😂😂

😂😩 funny Marco…he’s kinda funny and annoying at the same time
What’s the sound name in the background
Over here WEAK 😂 😂
Anybody knows where I can find that background music at???
😂😂😂
Why I looked up shocked at the end when he said Tiffany lol that’s my name
What’s this instrumental inna background of these videos??
Imma " dagoodbaby" threw me lol
Not the ATL script 😂
I knew he was gonna let that coughing pass without addressing it in some way😂😂😂
Da baby Uncleeee😂🤣
"Dis me waiting"😂 it be the lil stuff
When he asked why he rap the same on all the beats 💀💀💀😭😭🤣🤣🤣
Classic!!!
😂😂😂😂😂
I lost it when Da Baby asked Marco does wearing socks with flip flops hurt his feet. Then when they showed them. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The atl script part literally made me lmao for some reason. 🤣🤣🤣
Staying fucckn wit people's 😂😅😅😅
the backdround music😭😂😂
Then I would’ve gave you the fet rabbit food boy was bout to say some shit that was gone get em looked into for sure lol caught his self quick smart man
😂💀
When he said he called the police after being put into choke hold i couldn't stop laughing lol
That crazy in his eyes
lol the one and only baby he’ll take your girl and call her? Baby
Lmao talking about finesse Marco trying to finesse da baby by trying to put  the baby stuff in his pocket da baby let me get that back😂
He looks like the grinch that robs gas stations.
this one is the funniest one😂😂
Marco u need to book lil durk
😂😂😂😂 I had hit a lick for a cutie 🤷🏿‍♂️😔〽️
my boy got a million views , period ..
He had him re act da ATL script😭
Marco looking like Anthony Hamilton
I be wondering like do he be taking chances doing interviews wit certain people like I kno they go over stuff but like what da baby charge to come on the show !!! And I think he knows that he’s gonna get way more then what da baby probably charge him for this interview and da baby might feel some type of way idk….Shit be high risk high reward but still some niggas change up on you !!! I can tell da baby ain’t wit that getting over on him shit! But Marco really be giving them knowledge and promotion! It’s just do they really wanna help people that’s struggling or they gone continue to be manipulated by the higher ups to keep us in the matrix!!! That’s why it’s ALOT of NPCs cause you either get wit the program or get left behind!! Shit scary that you either believe in the Bible and we stay stuck or we let everyone be themselves and the world come to a end!! Cause if it’s kno structure then it’s no resources and everything would just run dry! We all would end up sick and hungry!!! But if there’s structure then people will continue to struggle and buy shit to make them richer!!! It’s amazing how some artist keep going for years making money after they reach a certain level of success!!! I think they also be stuck working and doing shit that they don’t want to do for the higher ups that they can’t talk about!!!
dababy funny asl
Oh no

Dababy funny as shit you look like you name came be bojangle 😂
That sip after “I pay my taxes” is golden 😂

Marco is definitely funny. 😂😂😂😂
This my second time watching this interview. I can't help but laugh.

Da Baby has a reputation for being an impulsive arrogant hothead but he seems like a good dude, just misunderstood. The sadness in his eyes when he told Marco he wasnt fuckin with his script was genuine. Shout out Da Baby.
You want me sing it??? No! 😂
Nahhh he goody asf kcutt
The awkward silences, the elevator music in the background, the feedback from their mics, the bad table read, the position of Marco's hat & his oversized suit. I'm either goofy asf or all of these elements together are genius ways to do comedy that is not so on the nose.
“Let’s pick this ⬆️?” 😩
“What made you stop 🛑 smoking 🚬 cigarettes?” 😩
Marco looks 49 years old
What you draw that for me for?
Ok let's turn this up
Da Baby looking at him like he’s gonna steal Marco booty 💀

“That’s me waiting” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

When he interviews certain people it messes with my anxiety. This was one those interviews. DAbaby can be an asshole, I was nervous for MARCO.
“Boy stop” 😂😂😂
I don't know why ppl still think these guests be surprised. They don't. They all watch his youtube channel nd interviews like us. Now in the BEGINNING....Heck yeah. The guest were FLOORED! Like wtf is really going on. Because ppl were snatching off mics, walking out, etc. It's just like the folks channels who do pranks. You can only prank the same person so many times, or prank ppl in general so many times, because once they find out it's a prank, you tell them your channel and even if you don't, your videos start circulating. But hey, ppl still click on them, so.....Da Baby is so darn fine! Shout out from Central Florida :)
I’m a single mother of two trying to get a car before winter. Can’t work because I have a newborn.please! Anything will help $ZabrianaWest

Grimlin vs bowtie. Blk ppl speak the same language. SMH some blk ppl will tell it all just to entertain, an some will be loyal to there family name! Da baby a field hunter vs security guard! 👀 security don't nothing he guarding, he just looking an telling!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I commented too soon!!! Funny Marco is something special in the lane of media and interviewing. Love this interview! I know very little about DaBaby and now I want to know more. Funny Marco does what I feel John Witherspoon (😥RIP) used to do…and that’s be a platform to allow other ppl to been seen, to be the light in the room…seeing the person as human and entertaining at the same time and you can tell he really admires them and wants to see them win. I think that is special trait to have ☺️
Do they know ahead of time they are being messed with?  If not, that shit gotta be tense.  Lol
Baby came just for the BS how long you been on cocaine 😂😂😂
😂that movie line was from the movie "ATL"
Bro wea yo shoes at 😝 lol

“You’re a good baby” LMFAOOOOOI😭😭😭😭
"so what? her name b dadaughter?" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I mean if a million ppl like it— I guess… but it’s a No Fa me.😕 I did like seeing da baby’s jovial side tho. 👍

------>Matthew 15:24** “But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” ----->John 4:22** “Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for SALVATION is of the JEWS. ---->2 Corinthians 11:22** 22 Are they HEBREWS? so am I. Are they ISRAELITES? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I. ----->Amos 3:1-2** Hear this word that the Lord hath spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying, YOU ONLY HAVE I KNOWN of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.
