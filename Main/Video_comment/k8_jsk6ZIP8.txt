Quality will be back to normal in 10-15 mins. Uploaded but still obviously not ready! Sorry.
Wrapping competition Yianni vs Matt
im I gone crazy or dreaming, Yanni has carcompany??? lol
Wrap off between you and Mat please!!!!!!🎉🎉
Who on earth would buy a Urus and paying cash for it? .. nobody
Me watching this with 170k euros cash in the bank
could drive the urus for 2 years and it still would be worth 150k...
Sooo .. nobody else heard the moaning in the background at 3:30-3:33  ??
Yianni is really good guy, always smiling so entertaining. You are exceptional. Sending greetings from Balkan! Edit is so brutal.
Good to see Tev on here, his speech has improved massively! 👏🏽
20:20 Car looks like it's straight outta gta
In this I'm taking the cash.    I'm investing in several auction properties, doing most of the renovation work myself, flipping them and do it all over again.   In 2 to 3 years time I have enough of a property portfolio that I can walk in and buy an Urus, a Bentley and maybe a Mclaren for a weekend toy, IN CASH, comfortably.    #ShortTermPimpinVSLongTermBallin
Screw the experience with the lambo dosh mate always
Yianni and team make TV production look weak.
I'd take the car and then rent it out and make some money from it, buy another car then do it and before you know it bang a nice money making business
What was the ‘perfect vehicle’?
wrap job with mat vs yianni, wanna see that

Im not a fan of chrome wraps. But the Urus looks brilliant.
Would nico and mark wrap the bonnet and boot in 2 pieces ?
Great video Yianni, QUESTION, have you seen this new colour change PPF?
shame that no one thought to keep the car, sell it to start a business or invest in an existing one 🤷‍♂🤷‍♂🤷‍♂
I see those Fast and the Furious Car's from one of the Fast and the Furious Movies Infact I Watched All those Fast and the Furious Movies when I was a Kid.
Why are they always talking to Yianni like he isnt wanted there? Could see a fall out coming. Bruv if they make you red faced often, you dont belong there. They always tryna cover up with snarly jokes.
What absolute idiot would take the 150k cash 🤣🤣 take the urus & sell it immediately
Grealish car looks 🔥
yanni you vidieos are missing the before and after and customers reactions when the cover comes off you must bring them back 😢
The yellow accents on yannys perf looks good
😎more of this 👍🏻
Errol (car detailer guy) looks like Kyle Walker 😂
THATS GOT MYNAME ON IT LOL
Yanni make a video of your old employed what They are doing now when they dont work for you anymore, exspecial the 2 filipino brothers
TAKE THE CASH  BUY A RSQ8 INVEST THE REST 😂😂
Great video - Would like to see an ‘up close and personal’ video with Nicco and Mark about their new business
Great video as always - busy month again! 🙌
Love
Good to see the team back  Maybe a video on how the old team is doing
I've asked this question SO many times but nobody ever answers (wonder why??) - at 9:38 you can see that the URUS is completely stripped (handles, lights, wing mirrors, doors)... what happens if and when something goes wrong with the car (a window stops working, the wing mirror mechanism fails) electrical issue with the lights, whatever) and the owner takes it back to Lamborghini and the dealer says "yeah sorry pal, your car is no longer covered under warranty, because you've had a 3rd party unqualified person/company strip the vehicle - your warranty is now void"?
i absolutely love the strategy for this new format or new way of filming, never had any issues with the old one it was shockingly nice but this one fits the scheme and its really well made, the edits are spot on absolutely spectacular, love the videos
The guy with the Bentley and Porsche, even his laugh sounds rich 😂
I miss Niko and Mark ❤
This was a great video , keep rolling them out. Shout out from South Africa
I'd take the car obviously and resell it, in my country 🇿🇦 that car is worth R6m the cheapest with abit high mileage which is like £248000 give or take, so the car would be best option here...
The Catch Up is my favorite Yiannimize content, I really enjoyed watching this 😀
These types of vids with the team involved doing their job have been missed. Loved it
Jack's car is banging
Sooo close to 2milli!!!
There is just no personality since move to MK the staff that made the channel fun to watch are gone, now they are either just dull or annoying. 😢
Bring back TWAY and TMAY
Sick video! Be a good series 👌🏽👍🏽
the winner is silly
Wrapping is a complete waist of money unless it's a race car or commercial
Look I don’t wanna be negative but come on he ain’t ready, If u ask him to parallel park I bet he can’t
Really AMAZING CARS just im gonna say  اللهم أرزقنا ياااا☝️ااارب
The red on that Bentley looks terrible 😂

came back to this channel for the first time and depressed instantly haha. what a car that is.
I'd like to see a wrap challenge with yanni, Lennie and mat
the guy with the super dark beard looks like porn star Mark Davis!
No happy feet has he left already
Its not what it was,mis the old crew. This is not even half the quality content it used to be. iam sorry
This is the content we miss Yianni! More of this please 🤞🔥
Edits on point, did they get a raise? 😂 Great video guys.
Lets do the wrap battle
I have a question for you: Why viewers from the US can not join the Yiannimize competition?
Cars and kebabs was unreal loved meeting you
So when’s this chunks part 2 coming
Music has been edited well too loud over the end of people talking.
No sound
Lost count of how many months this channels stalled at 1.97 million subs.. wonder when the 2M is coming? 😴
Winner took the money 🤔hey 😂 So winner lost 100k Yet won crazy day
did you forget to upload the video in 4k or export it in 4k
I once couldn't find parking space, but Yianni reached out and said I could leave it in his garage for a couple of weeks. Really top bloke
The max quality is 360p they need to reupload or export it with better quality
I sure I’ve seen the blue lambo down villa park
Was this recorded with a microwave?
👍
why the quality is 360p ?
Why is the quality so low guys 360p?.
Why’s it uploaded in 360p?
Bad video quality
We need Matt and yanni on bikes drag race
