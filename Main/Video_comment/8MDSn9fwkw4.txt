this is my revison for my maths test in 2weeks as a uh yr10, i gotta lock into move up to set2
suddenly I feel better about my gcses
6:14 now how tf did you get a bigger perimeter than area 😭
“Can I skip this one, I don’t like it” is honestly so real
I was thinking that I'd want to see george do a higher tier, but after that yeah maybe not
THE LAUGH AT 7:06
The is foundation 😂 foundation is mostly common sense
The fact that George got the second last question right from a guess is hilarious
How has the layout of the papers not changed in over 16 years, Its still the same font bruh....
5:44 15 WhAT JaMES, 15 APPLes?? That made me laugh sm thats amazing 😭✨
This counts as revision don’t tell me what to do
I've just done 2/3 of my higher maths papers and this made me feel so smart 😂 factoring is one of the easiest bits in maths please try a higher paper
Bro I literally had these questions in year 6 were you in the special class?
According to this vid im gonna pass my gcses with flying colours im not even worried
using this for revision rnnnnn
This is a reminder that some people can still fail foundation level😢
As a higher level GCSE Maths teacher, this speaks to me on a spiritual level haha
18:31 “what is factorising” imagine that meme of the soldiers face that was me in that moment
Watching this back I don’t even know how you could get a single q wrong
The hell they dont look like that bruh
If it weren't for you(george and james) i wouldn't be a fucking nerd again, which is what happy and proud of
I tried to see if i could d them before they answered
I failed maths GCSE 4 times
As a Year 8, I would be embarrassed if I didn't get 100% on this.
2010 and a foundation paper? Boy if this these were my exams I’d be in Cambride university or something
There's no way this is a legitimate gcse paper...Wtf did they give me then
This makes me question how can one fail maths
this is not a gcse level bro if it is why am I learning nasa level shit
I go to bed happy every night knowing I am smarter than George.
James and george literally my brain rn with the final mocks arguing
James turned into the teacher
Never knew the memeulous crew would ever attempt to sit an old past GCSE paper💀💀
*factorise*  "this is were they get you with the hard questions" don't tell bro about the higher paper content
How did I get recommended this the afternoon on the day of my maths moc while I was doing English revision lol
9:12 Hey diddle diddle, The medians in the middle, You add and then divide for the mean, The mode is the one you see the most, And the range is the difference between.
this is supposed to be difficult? this is elementary level
9:40 ah yes 15-4 is indeed 9
Foundation complete, now take on the higher paper
this is totally my revision 🤞
So Nigel just went 80km/hr from leaving his home for 30 mins. Where on earth in the uk is this possible? Wouldn't the road have to be directly away from his house in a straight line to even be going 80km/h? If it wasn't, that means he is going faster than 80km/h uninterrupted for 30 mins. Impossible.
try and do higher or gcse further maths :P
i am predicted an A* at further maths a level. why did i watch this
I love watching this because as someone who’s targeted a 9 it makes me feel smart
Foundation is easy af do higher
Even I could do this, I am eight years old right now. #roadto9years! Turning 9 in August!
U saying this is easy and I failed twice 😢😅
4.52×36 is easier if you work out 452×36,amd put the , thing to degrees,cauze we have 2 behind it in the original nu,ber too
I remember in my first lesson at A-level in 2011 we did this gcse foundation paper as a silly warm up. If got one wrong or were the slowest to finish you had to do a forfeit. It took like 10 minutes and we were laughing at how shockingly easy it was.
15:39 Chip shop Diva?
Is this what foundation papers are like? This is the easiest paper I think I’ve ever seen
For the last two, it's x = 19/3 and y^2 + 9y + 20
How is this a test to certificate secondary education?? This is so basic... 5th grade basic!
If someone in year 10 dramatically failed this exam paper for no good reason they’d be deleted from their family tree
15-4=9
Did i really just watch 20 mins of two people doing a gcse maths paper from 2010
It is a foundation paper though.
9:35 11. The range is 11😭
I litro have my GCSEs next week. my recommended is preparing me ig 🤷
5:55 its 15cm^2
this is easier than year 6 sats lmao
Higher tier will actually humble you especıially if you worked hard enough to go from foundation to higher tier and its your first higher tier paper
Am I the only one that did this when I was 11?? Like what on earth is this.
My year 6 sats were harder than this💀
This video has officially confirmed that George Memeulous is infact not my maths teacher disguised despite their resemblance.
Watching them do higher maths would be so funny it’s so easy in foundation at gets so much more complicated so quickly lol😭😭
Oh it was a foundation edexcel paper. No wonder it was so easy  Now imagine they tried a Higher Tier AQA Maths Paper
How are you doing foundation tier as adults 💀😵
I had harder exams when I was in year 6
you should try a higher maths paper now
9:08 mean is sharing, mean is sharing, mode is most, mode is most, median in the middle, median in the middle, range high low, range high low. To the tune of Frere Jaques 😂
12:41 george a what? a quadirilateral, its said quad-ri-lateral my guy
nahhh these lot are cooked, i feel so smart after watching this
15cm to the power of 2
Wish my exams were this bloody easy
5:55 , its not cm , its cm^2 bc its area!!!!!
I failed the foundation paper by a couple marks & I'm still sad about it.
I'm convinced that the exams used to be easier, I would've payed so much to do this exam instead.
I was doing this sort of work in year seven, set 4 maths… 😅
i watched this during my school years and felt so intelligent, two years later i have forgotten everything; i am now bonding
I never thought I'd be shouting at a video over someone making mistakes on a foundation paper I did mine as higher tier 18 years ago, but I did help my mum with hers before I did my own, and I did maths as a-level, so I did more maths of that level or higher for a lot longer than most I hope you marked these, I want to know what grade you would have gotten
9:46 9 !
These people make me feel smart…
When I first saw this i was in ur six and I could do every question lol
Hey diddle diddle the medians the middle you add and divide for the mean the mode is the one that appears the most and the range is the difference between
Bro. These are sats level 😭😭😭
Mate i had this test before in year 7
Teachers in the 2000s "you can't use a calculator because when your older you won't be carrying a calculator everywhere you go" now, we litteraly carry a calculator everywhere we go on our smart phones. 😂
15-4= 9
4:09 fr james
We were doing foundation level gsce math questions in year 4 😭
me sat here watching grown men  do "gcse maths paper" when this is literally what im doing in yr 8 wtf happened when did maths get more difficult
this years one was ridiculous
No way uk math is this easy
For anyone wondering why its so easy its because this is a foundation paper and its for those who struggle to do normal level maths so a higher paper would be what is needed for anyone without a learning difficulty above the age of 18 to be tested on
Anyone in 2024 rewatching some
They said the range was 9... so they didn't see the 4 sitting there... 15 - 4 isn't 9.. its 11 :) <3
ik i was top set higher  but jeez  how did people who turned up fail this?
Did my a level maths exam today, revisiting this video to feel better abt myself
Just did a Y12 (English Y11) CCEA GCSE Maths exam a few days ago. Never have I ever felt like a maths exam could get much easier in my LIFE, RAHHH.
9:38 I swear the range is 11
Does watching this count as studying
I will say, foundation is trivially easy, I never took it, I got an 8 on higher, but this is totally trivial
Id fail this now 😅
15-4=9 ✅
Watching this instead of revising for maths GCSE 👍
damn why cant my foundation maths exams be this easy
my foundation mock was so much harder than this, what the fuck
15 - 4 = 9
This sucks to watch as someone who is about to sit their higher maths exam in a week, can’t believe it’s this easy for the foundation students while we’re out here doing tangeant gradients and circle theorems
Watch 2 fully grown adult men complete a GCSE foundation math paper
it’s been 3 years where is the george and james take a gcse biology exam video 😔
I cannot believe this was recommended to me and I have about a week or so to my maths exam. And I’m doing higher
i just took my mock gcse higher paper and thank god i did better than george memeulous and james marriott
How has no one pointed out James getting fraction wrong” 2/3 x 1/5 = 2/15 “ what ??? 💀 it’s 13/15 did u divide ? 😂
Me after watching 20 year old men saying that 15-4=9.      😭
im 15 rn and my exams are fucking crazy, im not even joking 😭. like im currently doing the practice ones and even they're a struggle, ended up vomiting during class
nah cause the fact i did this type of thing in year 5 when i was like 10 or 11
This is stuff from year 4
Im a year 7 and even I could do this paper
Fifteen years ago, rounding whole numbers was a second grade math topic in the United States. I was eight at the time.  From what I remember, rounding 11 to the nearest tenths place, gets you 10 not 12. That’s because the number in the ones place (rightmost number) is not greater than or equal to five. The mistake George made was that he did 11+1 to get 12. A common error most people (including myself, of course) made in my class back then.
The UK 11+ exam was harder than this.
does this count as revision?
These look so simple coming from a higher paper.    Also what was their grade
Whattttt😭😭😭😭
I did this exact test in year 7…
IS GCSE GRADE 5 MATHS?
My statistics teacher (this is according to his wife - my other statistics teacher) plays this certain song consistently at home. We believe her because he never misses a chance to play it and even set the lyrics for homework last week. It goes, “Hey diddle diddle, the median’s the middle, you add and divide for the mean, the mode is the one that you see the most, and the range is the difference between.” This song is called the averages song (if I’m remembering correctly)
6:00 it’s cm2 or centimetre squared my guy
god i wish i did foundation i’d pass so easy i got a U in my higher paper
5:56 HE DIDNT PUT CM SQUARED!!!
Oh heck! I may have done this actual paper in 2010 for my Maths GCSE. How did I struggle???
Btw the angles are called vertically opposite angles
Me who solved my dat handling ans am seeing this
4:23 I do that and I’m in year 8 it’s easy  I learned half of this last year in year 7 and the others this year in year 8
I wish this was my gcse maths exam bro 😭😭😭
On question 8 it’s 15cm squared not 15cm 🤓
8:00 you only get 1 point as you didn't show your working out on the page
Foundation maths is not like this anymore 😐
my god this is shocking
Hope to god my paper is like this in june
if I tried to do this again I would just get PTSD and instantly get the thousand yard stare
I feel my academic scholar paper was harder, that may sound right, but this was for year 8
Fuck me, and i thought the irish leaving cert foundation maths paper was daft...
5:46 - Centimetre squared…
this is not my foundation exam mine mocks was hard
Blud really put 21 down as an odd number
Despite ot being a foundation paper, its very easy
2024 is gonna be 2024x harder than this
9D = £6.48
This had to be for the special ones
To be fair, despite knowing the method to do Questions like this and even more complex ones like functions and limits, if i dont have paper for my workings and a good amount of time id fail, im terrable at mental maths, I either have to write it down or else ill just get lost in the sauce of numbers
This actually surprises me, this is like yr 6 shit
2:55 you were 15!?!? I’m 15 and I learned this when I was like 11 now I’m learning calculus and trigonometry and things
why didn't you mark the test
Seriously, this is what my friends did? Absolute scam
James and George drawing a literal stem, leaf and key because neither of them have heard of a stem and leaf diagram 💀
damn George doesn't know the hey diddle diddle song for finding the mode. Haven't done maths in 3 years an I still know it lmao
it’s so funny that james still didn’t notice loads of them that george got wrong
How I learnt this stuff in year 8 and factorising was simple.
im praying my foundation gcse is like this in may bc i have not revised and they are in 5 months 🤣😅
Right that’s my gcse maths revision done 😁
give him an english language paper- or a higher maths paper. That should end him. If they somehow still pass, try giving them a DT paper.
Bro I did this stuff in year7 bruhhh
The scary thing is I actually know people who failed these exams. Majority of the time they cannot understand what you're even saying to them, extremely low IQ individuals genuinely do exist.
This counts as studying
This is not GCSEs, this is year 6 sats 💀
this must be foundation
this is my revision for mocks
15 what? 15 apples?  No,  15 suicide attempts.  All of them failed, thats why I'm still here or I would've been long gone.
Of course they pick a foundation paper; lets see them attempt calculator higher
Foundations so easyyy tho
I shit you not one of the questions on my mates foundation paper for our y10 mocks was “write down an even number”. And this was halfway through the paper allegedly.
I did my Mock exam for foundation maths less than a month ago and it was much harder than this shit.
15 - 4 is 9?
These grown men are failing a FOUNDATION paper 😭💀
they gotta try a post 2017 edexcel math paper lol
I count this as my revision
I wish my GCSEs were this easy 🥲🤣
Now do a higher paper
DO MORE TESTS PLS THANK
As a certified nerd, I saw someone marking this, but weren't very accurate, so I'm going to give my markings. I also found the marking allocation, so this is accurate  Generally Cambridge are very strict on working out, but I won't be that harsh. I will be basing working out marks on what they say and what they write. I will also be giving corrections  Qu 1: 3/3 a) 1/1 b) 1/1 c) 1/1  Qu 2: 4/4 a) 1/1 b) 1/1 c) 1/1 d) 1/1  Qu 3: 3/3 a) I can't judge this correctly due to the fact I don't have the sheet physically. I will give the mark though, bc I'm sure they know how to use a ruler b) 1/1 - Cambridge is lenient when it comes to measuring angles, they will give the mark usually if you are up to two off. I went and measured this angle. It is exactly 35° therefore they get the mark c) 1/1  Qu 4: 2/2 a) 1/1 b) 1/1  Qu 5: 2/2  Qu 6: 4/4 a) 1/1 b) 1/1 c) 1/1 d) 1/1 - it would've been better to specify that they were multiplying the term by 2, and adding 1 to the result. The correct format is actually '2n+1'. However they would still receive the mark)  Qu 7: 4/4  Qu 8: 3/3 a) 2/2 (since they realised their mistake, I'm giving the mark) b) 1/1  Qu 9: 5/5 a) 1/1 b) 1/1 c) 1/1 d) 2/2  Qu 10: 3/3 a) 1/1 b) 2/2  Qu 11: 3/3 i) 1/1 ii) 2/2  Qu 12: 2/4 a) 1/1 b) 0/2 - the range is 15-4, therefore, the answer is 11. Even though the working is correct and he made a mistake by subtracting 6, this won't come through to the examiner whether he actually knows what range is. Therefore no marks)  c) 1/1  Qu 13: 5/6 a) 1/1 b) 1/1 c) 2/2 d) 1/2 - he didn't show working  Qu 14: 2/2  Qu 15: 4/6 a) 1/2 - answer is correct. However the reasoning is vertically opposite angles are equal b) 3/4 - didn't give all reasoning needed  Qu 16: 5/6 a) 1/1 b) 1/1 c) 2/2 d) 1/2 - answer is correct, however working out is not   Qu 17: 1/3 a) 1/1 b) 0/2 - tessellating is when you draw shapes directly next to each other. What George was drawing is known as congruent shapes  Qu 18: 7/7 a) 3/3 b) 4/4  Qu 19: 3/3 a) 1/1 b) 1/1 c) 1/1 (we'll ignore the number 40 and go on what he said 😭)   Qu 20: 3/3 a) 1/1 b) 2/2  Qu 21: 0/3 4| 3, 5, 7, 7 5| 0, 3, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8 6| 1, 2, 2 Key: (e.g) 6|1 is 61g  Qu 22: 2/2  Qu 23: 0/3 - enlarging by a scale factor of 2 from the centre point 1,0  Qu 24: 2/2  Qu 25: 3/3  Qu 26: 2/2  Qu 27: 3/3  Qu 28: 1/6 a) 1/1 b) 0/3 - working: 8x - 12 = 5x + 7 8x - 5x = 12 + 7 3x = 19 x = 19/3 c) 0/2 - working: y² + 5y + 4y + 20 y²  + 9y + 20  Therefore their mark is: 81/100  If only my GCSEs had been this easy 😭
TL;DR: they got 84%  As someone with a degree in maths, I took the liberty of marking this paper. Here was my breakdown: (also my total marks goes to 99 not 100 so either I'm going insane or it's a mistake in the paper)   1.    3/3 2.    4/4 3.    3/3 but BOTD 4.    2/2 5.    2/2 6.    4/4 7.    4/4 8.    3/3 but they did arguably cheat sooo... 9.    5/5 10.  3/3 11.  3/3 (BOTD) 12.  3/4 (probably but BOTD) 13.  6/6 14.  1/2 because you didn't explain 15.  4/6 (the term is "vertically opposite" and you probably needed that to get the mark. I gave BOTD for the second part) 16.  6/6 17.  1/3 (no BOTD :( ) 18.  7/7 19.  3/3 20.  3/3 21.  0/3 22.  2/3 23.  0/3 24.  2/3 25.  3/3 26.  2/3 27.  3/3 28.  2/6 but that's being extremely generous  Total: 84/99. Idk what the pass mark is, but that looks like a pass
the way i screamed cm^2 for the area units shows the maths trauma
This is nuts
I don’t know how I’m hell I remember this but I did EXACTLY that Nigel question one day in a regular maths class as practice (yr 7) time stamp 14:15
Just did my higher tier mock today I wish it looked like this
As a gcse student doing exams this year, I no longer feel worried.
i home school myself as a 16 year old. i am actually using this as revision lmaooo, im gonna kms if my math paper aint like this
He lied. This is a fucking year 6 SAT paper
Foundation
Bro I did this in year fucking five
Now do a higher paper
oh my GOD why am i doing higher and not foundation i yearn for questions this easy
You got 12b wrong you silly boy, it's 11
To plus Too is For. Mental.
This is my revision for my gsces
I swear this was my year6 SATS paper
Anyone know what there got ?
I love how the hardest question in this paper is expanding double brackets.
George a mode is the most so there were two 6 so the mode would be 6 I don’t blame George though I have been doing foundation all my life through secondary school
at 4:33, the method I learnt was, you found how many it went up by, in this case 2, and took it away from the first number, so 3-2=1, so the formula would be 2n+1, so to find the twelfth pattern, the formula would be 2(12)+1=25
Foundation 💀
can you do a higher paper so i can yous your vid as revishon
this is a lot funnier now that i've actually done my GCSEs
God I wish my foundation paper was like this
It’s bad how many of these I’d get wrong if I did it today. Shows how little you need maths after you leave school
james getting 40 divided by 5 wrong is so funny
it pains me to see them using a ratio symbol for probablilities
Getting my revision in
The reason this was so easy was because they took a foundation paper, which is for the... less bright students. The highest grade you can get on one is a 5 (C). The actual big boy GCSE exam is called "Higher" where the highest you can get is a 9 (A**) where you would need to get around 80% of the marks  Generally you would prefer to do the Higher as not only is the maximum grade much higher, but the grade boundaries are significantly lower due to the increased difficulty. For example, to get a 5 in foundation you would need roughly 75% of the marks while for higher you would only need an estimated 33% of the marks. Therefore there would be no reason to take foundation unless you knew you would absolutely flop on higher.
George resitting his maths gcse for the 12th time
The amount of times I felt like smashing my head against a wall whilst listening to this is an absolute joke
wish i could take foundation
I'm not smart enough for this
5:50 ITS cm SQUARED.
I like how it got to factorising and that was the point my brain went, 'I know how to do this!' I had weird Maths teachers...
i'll never understand how anyone struggled with this
My friend did foundation tier and she told me her first question was to name a shape…   She still actually got it wrong though
I wasted my chance at an A because I choose foundation 🙃
Doing my exam in a an hour 😢
How does george actually male maths understandable wtf
Ngl I didn’t understand anything last like 10 minutes 🤣
I will never get over the fact they unironically call it maths
Well. This is the sum of my revision
dawg this looks like some shit i did in year 6 tbh 💀
james is what americans expect/thinks british people to be and george is what british and the rest of the world expect americans to be.
Okay foundation papers are NOT like this anymore 💀 they’re so much harder
Isn’t the answer to T=4w -2  5?  22-2= 20 20/4=5
This looks like a Year 6 SAT paper 💀
This is the easiest GCSE paper I've ever seen. Granted, I do take Higher so sadly I have no chance of flying through something like this paper here :(
I swear i did this exact essay in my SATS preperation test in year 6
i wish i was born 20 years earlier, i could've easily got a grade 9
This video feels like the posh kid is being made to tutor the chavvy kid and somehow they have become friends
4:27 this exact question was on my year 8 test
meanwhile we’re stuck doing AQA higher
please do a part 2
they got one wrong at 5:54 they forgot cm3
The fact they actually got a few wrong lol
doing this as revision cause i cba
I did this paper last week 💀
bro, last question of foundation is first on the higher ;-;
i will be counting watching this as revision.
Nah this is crazy bc this is literally like the 11+ level
i just graduated why am i watching this
the perimeter was 12 not 16 </3
I think you'll find you can indeed get half an animal.
This taught me more than school
I’m resitting this paper in June..I feel rlly dumb rn
why is this actually kind of entertaining?
bro i kid you not this looks like my year 6 SATS paper  😭😭
Currently doing year 1 a level maths, I wish I could do this instead
I did this exact test in year 6 😭
i just did a maths gcse higher mock today-   I wish I did the standard by the way this video went.
I thought i escaped maths when GCSE finished..... Until i took A level maths. What set were you in? Was in set 5
This has to be like the key stage 2 SATs or something...  I worry for the minds of foundation paper students
Is it bad that most of the questions were definitely on a test I took in 5th grade? I am not kidding.
Boys
5:50 HE FORGOT THE 2 (squared) PEOPLE, HE LOST ALL 2 MARKS      Edit: lmao why do I do this to myself
Just is
i’m in year ten and we just learnt stem and leaf diagrams and they’re so easy but so tedious when there are loads of numbers. 3/10 fuck stem and leaf diagrams but at least they’re easy marks
I wanna know what grade they got
If the maths papers were still this easy smh 😢 mum's fuming
I DONE FOUNDATION AND IT SLAYED
this made me realise how much i love factorising idek why but those last questions where george gave up those were my favourites
This video has given me so much more confidence that I actually might pass my maths GCSE!!!!!
i’d make sure i got an extra 10 marks on this paper just because of ✨extra effort✨-but also they might not even consider that- either ways wished this was my gcse paper
Bro doing foundation
got a maths gcse advert at the start of this video
james pretending like he wasnt a nerd in secondary
I was doing this shit in year 4
GCSE exams are embarrassing. These questions are elementary level exams.
George and James should do a English GCSE paper
Love how I'm watching this after doing my maths gcse paper
Mines literally today
im yr 7 and we r doing this stuff in class its so confusing and in dyislexic wich totaly helps😭
i'm in 8th grade and i would smash this
The fact that I oy remember stem and leaf and also factoring (don't blame me I fell 2 grades and have dyslexia)
Well how times changed
Do IGCSE exams
these are grade 1 maths-
Not me watching this YouTube video and claiming it to be revision even tho it's not my tier, exam board or specification (coz this paper's from 2010) lol 😂
It's pretty funny how there's ppl in the comments saying that 2010 GCSEs r a joke and that they're on about how their own year's GCSEs r way harder (don't get me wrong, I totally agree) but the funniest part is that 10 years later, ppl r gonna say that 2023 GCSEs are equivalent to yr6 work and that it's a joke.
I do this but with my university maths papers :p
Foundation is fucking piss easy
I feel like I might have done like a similar test in year 7
You guys sure it isn't a year six test
Literally grade 3 shit but some how the grade 12 i just graduated was easier. what is this education system
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ITS CM SQUARED THIS MAKES ME SO SAD
NOW DO HIGHER TIER.
Foundation paper is looking insane.
Me doing further maths rn being jealous of how easy this is 😂
foundation paper how is a lot harder
I'm doing my GCSE's this year and I hope to God their as easy as this, because this seems like some year 7 shit not year 11 GCSE's.
4x table according to George 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20, 24
bro hwo do people fail foundation papers....
I seem like Bill Gates now by watching this
not even a higher tier paper, disappointing
nobody saw him mess up the range in q12? just me? ok
Ayyy this way legit my paper
How this gcse, I had to do x to the power of five divided by y cubed converted into base eight and then into base seven just to ge5 into secondary school?
I really wish this was the GCSE paper now
14:56 😂 lol!
I did my maths gcse this year and this brings back memories lol😂💜 Edit: they should try the last question in the 2022 higher paper haha
"15 what?!!" i hated when teachers took off a point for not specifying the unit of measurements lol. like obviously i'm referring to apples not a fucking can of mountain dew😭
My GCSEs weren’t this easy😐 I’m so salty about this 😂
This was physically painful.
As a year 12 student who is doing maths and further maths a level it’s nice to see grown men struggling with the basics
this is like 11+ level
I did foundation paper this year I wish it was this easy
james is me. i am james
In my private school we do this as work if you are set 1 maths (Year 9 btw)
I remember doing my maths exam papers - I can’t believe how much harder exams have got in just one decade
Do it
when you times fractions you go 2 x 1   you need to find the common                  3    5 denominators, 15, then times the top number with the same number as the bottom number so you get 10/15 x 3/15 and that gets you 13/15. im 13 so don't judge on my explaining skills but i think im right
Gonna be honest, on my 3rd year in college I pretty much bailed on maths. I won't lie, maths is something I'm not great at like I know my basics as in money etc stuff you use maths on a daily bases but I just kept forgetting the other stuff and my main course work was getting more and more stressfull so I couldn't keep up with maths anymore.
Still waiting on the science paper
PLEASE TAKE A PAPER AGAIN PLEASE
i'm a few months away from gcse foundation maths, and fucking hell.
People are out here calling this easy lol, this is the non calculator paper. The calculator one is way harder cause you get trigonometry and shit
5:50 ITS CENTIMETRES SQUARED YOU DONUT😾
I’d honestly like to see him try a higher paper to see how he reacts to the quadratic formula and trigonometry
1 mark for not writing 15cm2
Me and my best friend got completely opposite results, I got 9’s in art and English and did crap in maths and science, she got 9’s in maths and science and did crap at English and art 😂.  (9 is an a** for reference)
Damn, foundation maths now is like algebra compared to what used to pass as exam level questions.
There are more jumpcuts in this video than chippies at the seaside
I honestly thought this was an American paper cus of how simple it is
the range was not 9...
this is so relevant to George’s Audience
I'm sorry Mr Ely, this has scared me
I'm doing my GCSE's this year. I'm doing the higher tier paper.      I do not feel confident after watching this back 😂
Little did they know if was foundation, not higher
I did gcse in 2019 and i can still remember staring at some of the question with stress.  I did higher maths and the last question jeeeez. Got the answer 30 when u needed decimals
George is smarter than me. i cannot answer half these questions properly.....
Why was this paper easier than the entrance exam I did to get into my senior school in year six🗿
I swear we basically did this test but with different questions in year 7
9:40 the range is 9😂😂😂😂😂. ???  Is this so George what about 15 and 4
Bruh. I didn't think foundation maths was this bad
I am in year 8 and still know james is wrong
They need to do higher igcse because that is fucking hard
1:11 I was doing harder in year 3 🤣
I think this would be more accurate if you got a lot f money for passing because the pressure really makes a difference when you're doing an exam. Coming from a person who just failed their AS levels.
I literally did this in yr6
yo got my results yesterday and got a 7 doing the higher papers
Why are peeps surprised these two guys who never used this math later in life are struggling in it lol
I'd kill a man in cold blood for this to be the test I took for the math portion of thr ACT (in America we take the ACT around the same time the UK takes the GCSE)
James says 'George' condescendingly too much.
Now try a more recent higher paper
The median wasn't 8 I don't think. I skipped a year of school.
me watching this doing a level further maths 👁👄👁
This reminds me of one of my 7th grade math papers
Bruhhhhh I did stuff like this in grade 4  😂😂😂😭
I think the papers have been getting harder.
I know I'm late but F to all the people with edexcell maths as I'm pretty sure it's harder than AQA
Doing yr10 higher asking you what colour of the Alphabet that fits the quadratic equation best whilst still being a factor of the mass of the sun disregarding significant figures but still shown in either surd form or standard form. I want to end it all. Send help
Range! 9?!?!
I’m pretty sure this is a year 8 test
If those last questions came up in a higher paper I would be so happy ngl 💀
I just did my three higher tier gcse papers and I feel disappointed at how easy that is 💀
This video is how I learnt ratio
Ah yes pre 2017 foundation maths.
What is the range between 15 and 4? 11  George: ok so that’ll be 9.
i swear i did the pattern one in y7
Wow
i wish to god this was gcse's nowadays
yes teacher, i am revising
9:37 dude. 15-4 is 11. Not 9
i do huger teir and i don’t understand how people do the foundation paper bc wtf even is this it might as well be year 6 sats
Ye I looked through my brothers actual gcse  papers and the questions were mostly rlly easy
Holy shit the edexcel maths paper was easy lmfao
foundation tier is just upmost year 7/8 work
As someone who just sat the non calculator foundation paper it is a lot more complicated now
im in year 8 and i could litteraly work out over half of these :)
According to George 15-4=9
why is aqa foundation 50 times harder
the foundation tier exam is harder now but still not hard
5:49 IT'S CENTIMETRES SQUARED - YOU LOST ONE MARK MY GUYS  Edit: Ah James realised it's all good
I literally learned most of this stuff in 7th grade and George and James forgot how to multiply a fraction as full grown adults
Bro it's just year 6 maths.
They for got the squared on question a. Furious. Edit: they added it in. Phew
even higher is easy as shit but the only reason its hard is stress
Just did my higher exam for maths and not one question on there was easier than these ones….
question 12 b is 15-4 = 11
i have my higher gcse test next year and i wish i could have that test
Q 23. Transformation vector by 5 over 5
I just did my maths paper and I wished it was this easy...
I was worried about my maths exam next year but maybe not ?
i did these for my SATS, george 😦
I am learning much more complicated stuff in fifth grade much more complicated
I WISH modern GCSE's were this easy. now there are WAAAAAY more factorizing and simplifying brackets, plus there are added expanding brackets. Also there are loads of stuff to do with circles.
Lmao so glad I didn’t do mine but still passed
"This is where they get you, this is the hard one" *shows a question on factorising - something that is really easy*
Me watching this 4 days until my maths GCSEs 🤣
"15 cm" its cmsqurd
Doing foundation papers for your mocks doesn't make you stupid ! I did foundation for my sciences and barely scraped a 5
6:00  it’s 12…
i failed my higher paper for GCSE by one mark... re took my exam but did foundation, easy breezy
The first bit was so easy! I can't believe they found it tricky.
I just watched through that video
How tf did I fail my GCSEs twice man, honestly tho I’d probably still fail
GCSE maffs
Am I the only one that feels like I sat this exact exam. Did do higher though
This is the only revision I need before my maths gcse thanks George and James for being excellent tutors
WTF GCSES WERE THIS EASY, IM OUT HERE DOING ESEXCEL HIGHER PAPER 1 MAY 2022 AND THE ENTIRE PAPER WAS HARDER THAN THE HARDEST QUESTION IN THIS VIDEO
this was actually fun to watch :)
Literally just did my further maths core A-level today and I got tripped up on some of these, I'm fucked
I wanna see the mark scheme and see what grade he got
How tf is this fair? I had to do higher and got a d and had to re-sit it to get a c. I could have done foundation and got a c no problems....
Lmao do 2022 maths
I did my maths paper 1 non calc yesterday and I feel like I have a 3rd eye after watching this compared to my exam
gonna fall asleep with this in the background as my last revision before my exam at 9 tomorrow 😭
the range was 11 not 9😭😭
Night before my GCSE this is my revision xxx
People bashing not knowing the questions. Literally as soon as you leave school you will forget a lot of things. Because they are irrelevant to daily life.
I’m smarter than George even though I’m 12🇸🇪
This is making me feel a bit better about my maths GCSE next week
I had to do a foundation maths paper for gcse and the first question was genuinely "which of these numbers is an odd number?"      I have never been so insulted in my life
This is my prep for my 2022 gcse maths
Exactly 20 minutes long. m.
I DID THE FOUNDATION PAPER AND GOT A C
i have my maths igcse paper in like 2 days and here i am
George’s hat sounds like a missing persons hotline
A grammar school Tory and a dyslexic roadman take the GCSE maths exams /j
This is like the one i did for my SAT's but easier
The fact me and George do addition the same way is cool
had to take the foundation tier for every subject because I had a 42% attendance rate - got all c's so it was alright.
Me and my last brain cell during the maths test.
Watching James actually struggle with some of the questions gives me great joy
Right so anybody have the mark scheme for this test? If so what'd he get
Take a higher paper lmao
George, people don’t call you thick, they call you thiqq
the fact that the median question was 4 is well funny
question 20a) 13/15
George: I’m clever! Also George: gets the question wrong
I had no idea the foundation paper was that simple  Also you should have a go at the higher tier paper. That shit’s hard.
Still waiting on part 2 of this video. More gcse papers
I'm American. I have an associates degree. This is more difficult than any math I've done in my university career. 🤣
in 2022 watching months before my gcse’s and crying because i’d do anything for my maths exam to be that paper
Father n son moment
im in yr 10 and my mock exam was NOT THIS EASY , i wish my gcse  was made in 2010
Is this the higher paper?  It's a lot easier than when I was at school.
You Brits are actually special
Anyone else notice he got 16 d wrong it’s actually 5 lol 😂
if this years higher papers could be that easy id appreciate it 😭
Surely this isn’t gcse? If it is then I have nothing to worry about.
as someone who did their gcse maths in november, *WHY* didnt i get this paper 😭
james is the BEST maths teacher ever
THEY DID THE N'TH TERM QUESTION WRONG
2011 GCSE Foundation Tier Grade 8 Exams vibe
Idk about you but my GCSE was not that fucking easy
is this…✨foundation✨
this is my comfort video lmao
this makes me have faith in my ability to pass my maths GCSE
Please do a-level maths I'm sure you'll enjoy it just as much as me
I've saw year 3 tests be easier than that test
I know it's foundation but even still this surely wasn't a GCSE paper....this is like year 8 level
4:55 how would that make sense to X2 +1? as pattern 12 is 25 and your supposidley doubleing it and adding 1 you would get 51 and they want to know pattern 100 and thats pattern 24
For the find the number in twelfth sequence I was screaming use the nth term
Lol, imagine doing foundation
fuck me there is some spaccers about
9:54 THE WAY GEORGE SCREAMED "OW" LIKED HIS TOES HAD JUST BEEN STAMPED ON
nah coz i genuinely thought the foundation paper was just like the first half of the higher with all the imposible shit at the end removed why the hell is this like a year 6 sats paper the hell
16:41
He’s after Rachel Riley’s job
Parents: We managed to pass our exams without the internet!   Their exams:
Bruh I did higher GCSE maths and it was nothing like this. I was not good at maths I don't know how I was doing higher maths but yeah. Is this really what foundation maths was like wow.
Since when we’re gcse exams this easy wtf
the difference between foundation and higher was criminal
the difference between foundation and higher was criminal
Not George forgetting to put cm squared
George got 12 b wrong
as a foundation maths GCSE student, I absolutely love this
Now do a higher paper...
“What is a stem and leaf diagram” just another thing you don’t need in life
I have to take this exam in a few months. I know I'm not the best at maths, but it's insulting for my school to think I'm this dumb.
george not using the column method is so disappointing
9:54 me when I get my grades back after never studying
Damn bro didn't know foundation was on that level
JAMES I CARE
4x7 is 24 No… Omg! It’s 6
i'm taking maths foundation GCSE and im telling you it is not this easy in the slightest this is an absolute lie
I’m doing my mocks and seeing this makes me cry.
Only year 8 that is easy
I just did my maths preilim (practice exam) last week and seeing them struggle on some of these I rlly want to see them try do a national 5 level paper
If half of these answers were their actual real answers im glad they stuck to youtube
nah aint no fucking way thats a paper, i wish i had that istg
We not pointing out,  ‘I last did math with I was 16, I’m twenty, that’s 6 years!’ Then ‘no I was 15, that’s 7!‘
My mock a was harder than this
i had question 6 in a year 9 paper   i got it wrong
should try an IB paper *AA HL is the hardest one
I remember in year 10 I got 52 / 60 on a set 6 foundation paper, and thinking I was so smart.
do a physics higher paper please
Holy fookin shit this is easy for even foundation. Honestly, I can't te'll the difference between foundation and higher these days, they are both hard
Maybe next time go for a more recent paper 😂
I did the higher paper, no fucking idea what a stem and leaf diagram is and every person in my class failed to get that question. Still dunno what it is
I teach maths and I too question how my students struggle with these...
The fact that year 6 me could answer these questions
12 b is 11 not 9 LOL he was so confident too
that looks like the tests i had in year 6 lmao, no idea how its GSCE
me thinking im good at maths after seeing the question george having solved most of it on his own-
This test is for Yr 8s lol as a Yr 8
Foundation lol
5:49 is cm^2😂
I like how George guessed 7 on the second to last question and actually got it right
bro this is easier then the 11+
9:41 yes 15 - 4 = 9
Lol try the A-level one now lol
U should definitely do a higher paper and then compare the difference. Cuz the gap between higher and foundation maths is loads
Can't lie this is a lot easier than it looks they just over complicated some of the questions Lol
when you’re doing a foundation paper and barely passing: 👁💧👄💧👁
doing higher and watching this video is like a fever dream
i feel like if i had this paper in my gcses i would’ve passed maths lmao i unfortunately didn’t bc i am shit at maths
Wht year is this as in wht grade
smart
As someone who did higher I really wish I did foundation, I would've gotten 100%, the difference in difficulty from foundation to higher is RIDICULOUS lmao.
9:34  Largest number = 15 Smallest number = 4 range: 15 - 4 = 11 George: *the answer is 9*
A level Further Maths next
Ahhh I’m from the UK but I’m on an American curriculum, missed out on all this :(
I really can’t fathom how one might fail foundation maths but everyone’s different
foundation XD
The last question on foundation is the first on higher....
5:49 hurt me inside
Is this an actual English maths paper or a piss take?
Ok now do the higher paper rip in advanced
In my first year of college and never fucking understand ratio since year 6 and james just explained it better than all my teachers
Haha I have to do higher 😅😅
I literally did this paper in year 8 omg I just realised I got 87
this is great revision for my mocks
as depressing as this may sound, george is still better at maths than me
no way in hell is this a gcse this is year 6 sats  or maybe its because i do higher gcse idk
If any of you are taking foundation maths I’m disappointed
This video has taught me more about maths than 8 revision sessions have.
Came here after my mock exams to feel better about myself
The way he forgot to put 15cm^2 at first-
Sorry its Cm²
So I'm taking higher maths, foundation is easy cause you can only get a 5, higher is hellish, when the smartest kid in the class, the one that gets very close to 100% in each and every test, struggles, you know you're screwed.  A few of my friends do foundation and their revision list for mocks was short and easy, mine was full pages for each of the three maths mocks, I was jealous cause I could easily get full marks in the foundation and still do better than I'd do in higher
GCSE foundation: Sally is 15 years old. What's her name? Sally. Correct!  GCSE higher: Why did your dad leave you? Answer should be 10,000 words including appropriate calculations proving the evasion of your dad  and the reasons behind it
whats a gcse?
Damn gcses were soooo much easier back then wtf
I have just watched a fully grown man work out the range as 15-4 and say 9 (being nice saying fully grown)
Me realising I did this kind of thing when I was ten
9:40 i really hope theyve figured out that it is indeed 11 and not 9 LMAOOO
damn i wish my foundation exams were this easy wtf edit: apparently this was a 2010 paper which makes sense. i took my exams last year and the questions at the end of the video were the kind of easy questions you were blessed with at the beginning of the paper
just rewatching it now and i've done my exams at 15, this is so easy compared to mine
i did not realise how easy foundaion maths was as I took higher because at my school we had to
ITS BEEN 8 MONTHS SINCE IVE WATCHED THIS, IVE DONE TWO GCSE MOCK EXAMS SINCE, AND YALL IM SMARTER THAN I WAS, but still fuck knows what a stem and leaf diagram is
That GROWTH mindset : can I skip this I don’t like this
Quadereralateral 12:40
Where’s the science test?/?/?
This is my two brain cells arguing with each other during a test
17:30
As someone doing higher I honestly envy anyone doing this test.
i literally had a math exam in year 10 today. im proud to say my exam was more difficult than this.
I wish the gcse maths was still like this
Do a higher teir paper that would be funny
I'm doing GCSE right now and it is way harder than this, this looks like my set 6 maths paper
George forgot to put centimeters squared
hay didle didle the mediums the middle you add then divide for the mean the mode is the one that you see the most and the range it the difference between. was how i was taught
Bruh why can’t my GCSE paper be this easy
I remember doing this paper in school, and I also remember doing every one of the ones that came after it for 2 years before I finally passed haha xD
I do these exams and I'm in year 8💀
James taught me how to do ratios in 5 seconds better than my maths teacher did in my entire time of having him
Why did I enjoy this so much?
In grade 5 this is easy
I love the squid game reference at 8:35
They are called foundation for a reason
I actually have to retake my maths gcse exam because I failed :D
that square will cost you like a whole grade when it comes to area.  don’t forget the bloody square.
George you forgot the 2 above cm
the sad part is. these bois teaching me better than my own maths teacher...
I wish foundation was eligible for getting the 6-9s otherwise I’d have no problem doing foundation 💀higher is honestly a different story from foundation 😭🙂
BRO I JUST REALISED HOW EASY FOUNDATION TIER IS
Area is squared cm I feel sorry for them it’s an easy mistake lol
When u didn't care about math's at all to the point you didn't even try, now looking at the question wooow most of them are easy, fun looking back at  how I just focused on watching anime and sleeping.
I think my sats where harder than this
When you watch during gcses
why does this shit have so much lore lol
Foundation lol
This is just really easy like Jesus Christ
These comments are so funny. I finished school in may with an A in math, and I can’t remember how to do any maths. I’d probably fail this paper too.
WHY DIDNT THEY MARK IT
15 what apples. proceeds to write the wrong answer of 15cm 😔
We didn't get to find out what they scored :(
laughing at the fact that im rewatching this and i worked everything out rlly quickly yet when this video came out it admittedly took me longer than George LOL
What was the final mark
I had to do the higher paper and I swear there’s never gonna be a time in my life where i’ll ever use ANY OF IT
I appreciate the use of “maths” instead of “math”. I just like the way maths sounds compared to math. And because I use maths instead of math.
That one kid that had to do this after watching the video: 𝗗𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗰 𝗹𝗮𝘂𝗴𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴
ma brain hert
james is oddly supportive in this…
I did foundation and failed 😂 pass second time tho 😂
I remember doing this in year 6
I did this practice paper in class last week lol
this is so easy compared to what we have now you're taking the piss
Where are my set eight kids night before the exam 😂
Ok so I took this paper like 5 times over the course of my comprehensive and college education and at no point were the questions this easy
I took foundation maths this year and I can tell you now it was not this easy 😂 I wish  Also let’s ignore when I was doing my maths gcse this video is what I watched when I said I was revising 😂😂
A level maths student, asking why they are here😭
i lost brain cells watching this
I remember taking this quiz in year 6 💀
I could do this and I'm in y9
this video made me cry
this isnt  gcse i swear, i done my mocks in year 10 and it was wayyy harder than  what they are showing.
Bro my mocks were way fucking harder than this and i did foundation- 🥲
in a couple months im pretty sure this is the paper im doing, fuck me this is piss easy
9:35 I now understand why he took foundation, he put 15-4 as 9
this hurts
How was my year eight maths paper harder than a lot of this gcse paper  Edit: this is a sats level paper at most
i must have gotten so dumb. IM DOING MY MOCKS THIS YEAR OMG IM LITERALLY DOING MY GCSE’s NEXT YEAR OH GOD
I’m gonna say what I think it is, I will not be writing anything down and I’m doing my English homework rn I’m in yr11  6 11 Idk how to do that one 15,672 Thirty thousand and twenty I give up this takes too long
NO GET THIS OFF MY TL IM DONE WITH MATH I PASSED IM DONE IM DONE NO NO NO NO NO N O
15 minus 4. Ahh yes, 9
Is this a GCSE Y7 paper- why is it so easy :(
And hears me stressing about my maths GCSE
6:59 it would actually be cm2 (squared) I cba to explain why but yea
im actually taking my cambridge examinations soon and this counts as revision for me lmao
PLEASE DO SCIENCE OMG
oh god I wish I had James as my homework tutor instead of my dad, that really was a terrifying time in my life. never again.
I love how James wasn’t briefed before coming on and is so disappointed at his life choices
range biggest minus smallest hmmmm yes 15-4=9
Did he say yr 10 if that is equal to grade 10 in america George must be incredibly stupid. Pls tell me his isn't normal in england
9:38 15 - 4= 9
this is making me feel better about struggling in the higher math test
As a higher maths gcse student I’m so fucking offended at how easy foundation teir papers are
I understand why people fail that test... They just can't be bothered to fill it in XD
This gives off extreme older sibling helping younger sibling with their homework
And suddenly I want to do foundation
in the centimetre question he forgot the squared for the area GJDJDJDDJDJDHDHSHSB
Do a Scottish National 5 paper
It took me 4 years to get my maths grade :')
nah this CANT be gcse LMAO i did this kinda shit in my first year of secondary school when i was 11
I did foundation maths... I swear this was harder 6 years ago
Loving the fact that i got a gcse related add on this
seven.
This brings war flashbacks.
they were to scared to do a higher paper lol
Why no results?
I thought I forgot most of my maths but I really didn’t
I was doing my exams when I started this video and it pissed me off
BTW its 15 cm^2
one of my foundation maths question is quite literally. name an odd number. worth 1 mark. loads of people in my year got it wrong.
hmmmmmm this video was released the day before my bday
I'm going into year 9 and I did this test in year 7 fml
James is the depressed teacher hating their job and all children on the planet and george is confused child asking for help on the easiest questions
Im realising that i had harder papers in year 6
this the level of maths that i got in year 6 bruh XD
i just sat a higher tier paper like 2 months ago, if i’d known the fuckers sat next to me had this shit i would’ve flipped lmao
I did some of these questions in year 3
Next year, im doing that test (GCSE) so wish me good luck
Proud that when they got to the last question I remembered the FOIL method, been 7 years and still got it 😎
Everyone in comments: talking about how tests have gotten easier yet harder at the same time. Me, who's going into year 10 soon: *haha I'm in danger*
My year 9 end of year exam was so much harder than this 😆
Alternate title, teaching a tory why the education system is weighted toward the rich
I watched this before my gcse maths exam
How they're going about how  it's easy and then there's me for 6 years doing foundation paper to only get a D 🤣
ok as someone taking maths a-level this is probably the most infuriating video ive watched
this is what yall in foundation did? damn
OK I did higher but i swear i did a mock in foundation that was harder than this.
You should be my math teacher 😅😂
We need another video of them going through the mark sceam and asking if the answer they got is acceptable
Private school man does plebs maths
17:07 james=Jim
How did you do this when you were 15 and I did this when I was 12
How tf I fail this 🤣
we was promised another video like this, where is it XD
thee higher papers were so hard and yall were out there counting cows in foundation?!
How on earth is GCSE maths actually entertaining. How is this possible
all asians watching this video: *pathetic*  jokes aside love ur vids george and james <3
*war flashbacks intensifies*
<3 <3 <3
can u do gcse english
hey diddle diddle the medians in the middle you add and divide the mean the mode is the one that appears the most and the range is the difference between- we learnt this is y8 lol
I did both papers and still got just a C in the higher paper 😂😂
James is like the teacher I never had. thank you james
Please tell me that is not a real foundation paper
Like hell it was that easy. I DEFINITELY didn't take "foundation" maths then. Looking at this, I really should have; would have made exams SO much easier. On the other hand, IB SL math afterwards would have been true hell
I'm Yr 11 in like a few months and I just realised how much harder it got in just 10 yrs. 2021 end of topic tests are lime twice the difficulty and I'm still talking bout foundation
2:50
Jesus Christ I just say my yr10 mock I did the maths higher paper!  If this is the actual foundation paper lord kill me!!!
Ppl who fail this test need to be stopped from breeding
truthfully i did my maths gcse foundation last year and it was harder than this😂
I want their results hahahaha
The trick to doing foundation is act real dumb despite knowing all the maths in class, GCSE HACKS
This is honestly what y'all are doing in England??? My fourth grade exam was harder wtfff
I did foundation and even when i was first doing it it was a breeze. Finished it in like 20 minutes. Slept for the rest of the exam
I’m doing gcse maths in foundation and this is so easy.. shows how it gets harder every year because it’s quite difficult rn, especially for someone that’s not that good at maths.
I find this incredibly painful to watch and I don't know why.
Technically they made a mistake on the cm grid area question. They didn't answer it in cm squared.
bahahahaha, a foundation paper is what you use in year 7
After seeing this i think ill be fine with my gcses
15:53
Doing calculus in first year uni makes me wish we had this
Wanna see theses guys attempt a further maths paper, should be.... Interesting.
I got my C (I did higher) and was like good enough. The trick is, show your working out even if it makes fuck all sense. You usually get more marks compared to getting the question right.
me who got a c at gcse maths and promptly dropped it,,, some of this hurts my brain
When you're not shit enough at Maths to do foundation, but you're not good enough to do higher tier Maths so you do intermediate tier.
No one else going to realise the range should’ve been 11 not 9
This feels like a 6th grade paper, what the hell
My year 6 sats were harder
this is my revision for my mock tomorrow
Bruh if this is foundation  I wanna move down rn, mans doing a year 5 test for GCSEs
watch it in 2x speed
omg the foil question , george please let me tutor you and teach you foil like it stressed me out that you didnt do it when that is legit the easiest thing
as someone who has only ever done higher , im astounded at how easy this is like what the hell , can they be like this for my maths a level please
It's a 2010 paper so I am pretty sure this paper was released and used before specifications updated and changed around 2015 I think
5.50 i feel like we are ignoring george tells james hes wrong then gets it wrong himself
15 - 4 = 9 are ya sure George
This looks like a year 5 end of term test
this is similar to what this years gcse was like, i thought the teacher was taking the piss, but i wasnt complaining that i got an easy test
We need a science paper now 👀
The foundation maths paper is kinda harder now idk
I feel like top set year 9 is harder than this
James is so supportive and talks him calmly through the steps, better than some of my teachers hahaha
I remember I missed a lot of school and they put me in foundation maths. I always enjoyed foundation maths because it was easy and one day I asked to see what the higher paper was like... I decided to just stick with a C, sod the questions on the higher papers. The difference was staggering xD
I just did my higher tier mocks this week and the difficulty difference is so big U guys had It easy if this was how difficult it was for u when u were younger
I did my gcses 2 years ago and I couldn't answer some of these. Idk how I did higher tier
Funny thing is i had this as my maths gcse exam an i did that in 2014
I did foundation and it was harder then this
Question 8a is wrong... when finding the area you do the measurement and then square. so if the answer is 15 then it’s 15cm(square) with the small two above it
You got the range wrong should be 11
I love how George makes fun of James not knowing how to explain the mode even tho he doesn’t know what it is
p to the power of 4 sounds like a bar
DO HIGHER MATH
These were the tests we got in year 5 lol
I did this in primary school
Man, I just did my higher level maths test and this made me feel good tbh
Ok I’m back after doing my higher maths gcse papers and WOW I wish that I had this paper. I had no clue wtf was going on in mine, especially paper one non-calc, like WHAT I’m so fucking jealous. The anger I have rn at the difference lol
watching james work out maths problems is oddly comforting 🤣🤣
my set 1 self was screaming during this video
james: you could have also picked 4…
watching the foundation paper has boosting my confidence a ton
As a person currently doing mocks this video is reassuring but also it is not this easy anymore
Makes me feel confident in my maths skills
As a person who has done their O levels and gotten Straight A's and A*'s at the age of 13 ( I did them last Oct btw) I can guarantee that it's still this easy
this would've been so easy to me
James feels like George's lawyer in this...
Well I've gotta do the higher tier GCSE maths test in two years rip😫
DEAR CHRIST DO ANOTHER ONE PLEATHE
I did this shit in yr2 sats wtf
this is giving me flashbacks
I always wished I done foundation
So basically Foundation GCSE is a Year 6 SATs Paper? All these questions are taught in primary.
No offence, but I even knew some of this back when I was 7. I learnt about the coordinates back when I was in Year 7.
Please please do an alevel maths paper!!! Its not that hard... ahem ahem.. 😂
I’m so confused by half of this video just because I went through the US school system. Wtf are GSCE’s and why do y’all get levels? Is it like our Pre-ACT/SAT system?
I’d like to see them do higher maths
Bro this is so easy compared to the exams we have to do now
I’m getting ready for my year 10 mocks for June and seeing this makes me feel quite hopeful even though I’m doing higher..
I just done my maths gcse in foundation and it was not this easy
Why?
14:51 for multiplication you just multiply top numbers and bottom numbers together.
Acute angle
If these are maths GCSES my mocks were harder than this wtf
this is a primary 5 exam i
This hurts me as an IGCSE student 😂😭
im from a country that doesnt do gcse and a-levels are done in international schools only, our public highschool ends with a nationwide exam and i would say some of these questions actually are similar to our maths exam hshdha, not the reading comprehension stuff, more the angles, triangles and the formula stuff
yo my exam is next week lmao
I'm having war flashbacks to 4 years ago struggling to pass foundation 🥴 how did I fail so many times? Being 21 now most of this is soooo easy 🙃
Omfg this literally looks like my end of year test
George you forgot the cm squared
This doesn’t feel like a foundation paper
Perfect revision for my uni maths exam 🙃
The median is 4 smh
15 cm squared
As someone currently doing A-level maths, this was painful to watch lol.
This made me feel smart
i didn’t realise that foundation was that simple what i’ve done a maths test a week for six weeks in a row for my gcses and they were all so solid i_-
I do the higher tier paper because I’m in the highest set and the difference between foundation and higher is HORRIBLE. I did a paper recently and there were things such as pythagoras’ theorem, compound measurements, bearings etc. My friend did the foundation paper and (I kid you not) one of the questions was something like ‘what is 10 times x’ LIKE BRUH ITS 10X THATS SO SIMPLE AND MY QUESTIONS LOOKING LIKE ‘work out 3.2*10^3 + 5.1*10^-2 divided by 4.3*10^-4. Give your answer to 3sf’ I’m sitting here like 😃
Did I actually just watch 2 guys do a maths paper for 20 minutes when I already passed it 2 years ago?
Q 12 b is wrong you schmucks
4 years completing my masters in Engineering and I have no idea what a stem and leaf diagram is lmao
This is 100% a year 10 paper. Cuz I didn't learn simultaneous equations and error intervals for no reason
nigel left at 10:15....
just did my maths gcse endorsement papers. watching this physically hurts.
Are u sure this is GCSE? My year 6 SATs were harder than this
DO MORE MATHS
watched this with my mum. safe to say she wouldn’t pass maths today
this hurt my brain
according to george 20-15=7
I've never been so offended over how easy this is compared to IGCSE
I would love to see these two tossers attempt A Level Chemistry
You need to go through and mark it😂
I could've sworn I did this in primary school
British culture is weird. They all continue to assume James is the smart one because he's posh despite the fact that he's pretty reliably incorrect on most shit he guesses
I failed my maths gcse <3
This is absolutely beautiful to watch after just finishing my higher GCSE maths paper
How is this gcse this i like year 4 shit
Man I wish I had this type of math. I'm lucky if I even get numbers in my math questions nowadays
maths sound very weird in english
This is too easy
DO THE ANSWERS!!!
Is it bad that this hurts to watch because for the probability one they used a ratio and I’ve not even finished my gcse
As a teacher in training this was actually painful to watch
ok I unfortunately did foundation 2 years ago as a last minute decision, This isnt foundation this is basic reading. Dont get me wrong it was still a joke but this... if you lose more than 3 marks you are set 8 stupid realistically you should get every mark on this
Do another one but with Joshy
genuienly this isnt even a meme that foundation paper looks like a year 4 maths test
my end of term tests so much harder than this 😭 also all the people asking why it’s so easy is cuz they get harder and harder each year
This is some primary 4 type stuff
Okay but im for some reason expected to do higher papers for science and maths- I KNOW ABSOLUTELY FUCK ALL FOR BOTH
i really want to know how much they got on that test now xD
Dang I wish Scottish exams were like this
“Yeah so the area is in cm”  Me screaming at the screen: *IT’S CM^2*
Me, 2nd year university engineering student watching this: *in pain but also humored*          why am I watching this.
when u relise you would fail this paper
You’d both do badly.
So this is what the bottom set kids were having to do while us top set people were having to do binomial expansion.
Why is foundation so easy. I’m doing higher and pulling my hair out.
The mode question was wrong... it should be 11
Pls do a recent higher tier maths paper
Where’s the science !!!!
Omg the 2010 practice papers😭 I left school almost 5 years ago and remember having all the old papers printed out and used
9:41 it's 11, no?
As someone in top set maths in year 10 im guessing this is the standard paper and I must say wtf this shit looks all grade 1-2 the fuck imma even studying for the Higher one when I could get grade 5 from fucking shitting on a piece of paper here
Oh this isn’t the Scottish papers.... I was so confused 🤦
This is well easy than the shit I’m doing in school now I get asked “how much money has this person made over 5 years of his investment “ or something like that it’s bullshit
this is the foundation tier? bruh
The thing is I did a foundation paper and I swear it wasn’t this easy 😂 all I can say is on the front it says it’s from 2010, and the papers have gotten a lot harder and marks are harsher now haha. But some of the questions in there are ridiculous 😬
Lol, I remember doing my foundation paper, It was so easy that I just knew so would pass
As a year 11 doing foundation why tf don’t I get this shit anymore
as an IGSCE student, this seems wrong
I’d kill to have a test that easy
just did my maths paper 1 higher gcse, im loosing brain cells watching this.
This is a wake up call for the British education system
The last few questions on the foundation are the first on the higher, just to give an example to the difference in difficulty 😂
My maths checkpoint paper was harder than this what the hell 😭😭😭
Should have taken IGCSE test instead
Do I higher paper I dare you
Foundation is a lot harder now
I feel like I’m watching a man and his Carer
9:36 15-4=9
Gcses go through everything you have learned
So are tests in Europe way easier or are they just overworking us in the US
This isn’t even maths this is just logic tests. And they still can’t do it!
...               you took this in year 10?
i’m in 7th grade and i knew every question-
little did they know this was not a GCSE paper
Ew Edexcel wtf is this   - This post was made by the AQA Gang
Me : sees angle x  Also me:  *it's an acute angle*
This brought back the 7x time of suffering I endured over a 4 year period just to get a D in higher maths in the end. 2024 edit found out I've sat my paper 9X!
I could do this in grade 8
I’m taking precal rn and am very happy I don’t have to go through this all year
We just going to ignore the fact George said the range between 15 and 4 was 9 ...
Pretty sure I did this test in year 4
I wish I had taken these GCSEs my year 8 test was harder than this
A person at my school has the same handwriting as George and his PC pen
This is a really old test they made them harder
This is something I did in year 6
I love how he got algebra and geometry questions right but couldn't identify that 2 was less than 4 lmaooo
Write down 13% as a decimal George: “0.15”
The foundation tier could literally be passed by a semi compitent year 7
this stuff is year 7 stuff istg
I’m in 1st year and I would get 100% in this
Lolll im finna take one too in a few weeks but mine is the real deal, wish me luck please
I feel like I'm watching father and son trying to do math homework
What was the point if you don’t find out what they even got right or wrong
this video made me feel a lot better about my lack of math skills.
Didn't know British education was this f ed
least I don't get shwot doin me maffs
bruh I wish I could sit this one lol. My school are making me sit further maths and it's hell
do A Level maths now
Do alevel maths
*sigh* the answer wasn’t KiTe it was rhombus.
the fact i have missing maths homework and  i am watching this i would be disappointed if my parents weren't disappointed in me
I did this paper. This paper is the reason I have a maths GCSE. (i’m 24 for the record i’m fuckin old)
This counts as my revision
yes i am watching this mid A level maths online lesson just to feel something
Plot twist this is really just 20 minutes of George getting James to help him cheat on his online learning test without making it obvious
I sat the higher paper on that day ... and managed to get an A , I wish it had been that easy and it was bleeding hot in the hall and watching everyone leave cause the higher paper was longer (1hr 45mins )
It’s super hard to pass that paper since you have to get more of them right than if you were to do the regular maths paper (the only reason I passed)
My teacher: remember to practice for the math gcse  Hm yes I'm practicing rly hard yes
Why are the people in math questions always buying the most random stuff. It’s like  ...Mike has 27 apples , who the hell buys 27 apples ?
I'll be honest, the 8/9 PSAT math section is harder then this.
4:34 uhm nobody gonna talk about the fact that says 9 11/911 LMFAO
I wish this was GCSE ._.
Im so happy covid made it so our teachers just gave us grades cause i would have failed otherwise
james is like a parental figure
I never knew foundation was this easy
Man said 21 is odd
Can't wait till this becomes a series and we get into the upper calculuses.
The sheer difference between not only foundation and higher papers is astounding xD not only that but the difference between a 2010 paper and a 2020/2021 paper
Alternate title: James Marriott helps his son take the GCSE maths exam
At 8:03 I knew 1.85+1.85 strictly because where I work, a medium coffee is 1.85 and people usually get 2 = 3.70. Dear lord help me
I like how we can now say we watched George and James as revision
Did you pass?!
If you guys don’t get at least 90% on foundation maths as adults you should be ashamed
this video reminded me a have maths hw due tomorrow 😃 i wish my homework was this easy 😭
I have never done factorising before either. I did factoring which from what Ive looked is a similar concept, I think, to whatever factorising is. But you would never see a problem like 3x+12 in factoring, is would only be done when in quadratic equation (ax^2+bx+c) but this problem is a linear equation (y=ax+b) which can ever become quadratic so honestly I think that factorising is so outdated math  term that doesnt get taught anymore. - from a confused calculus student
Do a Higher GCSE paper from sometime recent like 2019 and by AQA and you will cry.
the fact that i learned this in elementary and middle school (i’m american) and 30 year old men are struggling with it kills me
Education in 2010 when labour were in gov goes to show
I’m doing my foundation math gcse in the next few weeks I’m in year 11 and dumb
5:46 the amount of times my maths teacher said that is unbelievable
The paper is from 2010 and foundation papers are much harder now. Everyone in my school wanted  to do higher maths because it's much easier to get a C.
5:55 it's cm²
5:46 you forgot to add the square you donut
Mafs
this is easier than the homework I got set in year 7
Ok my gcse revision is done
they should try a november 2019 higher lmaooo
This is a GCSE paper. Are you kidding me this is like a paper that you get in year 5 to see your math "skills" what.the.hell YOU GET THIS PAPER IN YEAR 5 YEAR FIVE!!!!
ngl I did the higher and failed and then I did the lower and failed and then I retook the lower and failed and then I retook the lower and failed again and then I got an unconditional to my dream uni so I decided to stop bothering ahah
15:00 How have they never done stem and leaf diagrams!
James would be a banging tutor no cap
this is how i do maths...
Am I the only one who feels like they’re losing brain cells while watching this?
9:42 THE RANGE IS 11 GEORGE YOU MELT
As an A level student I can’t tell if this made me smarter or dumber
I did my GCSEs in 2019 and I did the higher maths paper this one looks like something I would have done in primary school
DO A SCIENCE ONE!! but don't do a 10 year old one because I've seen the maths foundation paper and it is NOT like this lol
Bruh question 12 the answer is 11 not 9
Bruh Iam in year 9 and a normal checkpoint test is like 10x harder than this bs
I did most this in year 7
I just got so triggered at 5:55 when he forgot to put the squared after the cetimetres
Why do I remember doing this in year 6?
This was so mind numbingly bad, it made my PC turn off.
To this day I still do not understand stem and leaf diagrams, those teachers never mentioned them and now I am disappointed
9:41 IS 11
Who actually wants them to mark the paper? 😅
I feel like the tittle is wrong, it should be “George fails a GCSE test and James doesn’t”
I look at my math paper after this n this make me think of the good o days(இωஇ )
No this is the literal paper I did at GCSE 😂 I recognise Q5. 😭😂
imagine doing further maths as well ;)
Why did I do this in grade 6 (now in grade 10)
I have my maths gcse early next week...
I swear the new papers are harder 😂😂. You should try to do the 2018 higher paper
I did things like this back in y6 for sats help-
14:40 2x1 = 2 3x5 = 15 so you get 2 over 15. which looks like 2/15 (can't put a fraction idk how)
doing my whole education in Spain and curious on what a GCSE looks like...
Okay now do Maths A level
I actually learnt from this video.....
this why they made the new GCSE system in
This video is just showing hoe much easier gcse maths was in 2010
i swear i took this exam in year 6
Oh my gosh please try year 6 SATS or even better have a look at the 11+ that would be hilarious to watch
You could genuinely do this paper in 10 minutes tops. How thick are these kids 😂
God I wish further maths a level was this easy
When i did the foundation paper and struggled now i feel stupid 😭
As someone who is currently in Yr 10 this is EASY why can’t we have THIS
Imagine saying the range is 9 when it’s 11 😪
i refuse to believe this is foundation... i have much harder questions than these
my year 10 general maths exam was so much harder than this i would be getting A if i took this lol
well done george you did merely average x
If my GCSE exams looked like this, I’d be an astrophysicist
4:42 you can find it out by using the nth term rule
Bruh I'm doing simplifying formulas and pythagoras theorem in year 7 and this is gcses?
i only remembered range, median, mode and mean with a riddle and that’s it   hey diddle diddle, the median’s the middle, you add and divide for the mean, the mode is the one that you see most of and the range is the difference between
Why couldn't my exam be easy like this? In Year 6 when we were getting closer to SATs they gave us math exams with questions like these to complete every Friday. Same types of questions. Just different numbers.
wait this is gsce... now i feel stupid worrying about it.
As someone who uses maths everyday... this is hilarious
As a person who got a 9 in my mocks, this is painful to watch
I don’t think it’s this easy 11 years later
This was easier than year 6 sats😂
12:03 and 12:16 LMAOAOAO
Quadadadilatiral
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CORE AND EXTENDED IGCSE IS UN BELIEEEEVABLE
I want to see them do a geography paper
Is this what GCSEs r actually like cuz I learnt this stuff in year seven is it really this easy?
Me shouting at my screen "ITS CM SQUARED!!!!!!!"
I got fucking shafted if this is what your higher exams are like in England
"MaThS iS EaSy" Some nerd prolly   Edit: Memeulous, u r a absolute madlad youtuber but u a dumb ass fr
is this George mason why is he in a hat and mask and sunglasses
I love james' chiming in and giving him the damn formulas.
Please do the AQA 2019 higher paper that I had to do, I wish it was this easy 😂
I don't wanna flex but I did the higher tier (infinitely harder than this) in year 7
15 what apples no cm me :CM SQUARED FOR GOD SAKE
When it’s cm squared and they had to google
I’m doing a level maths and feel like I lost knowledge after watching this video
Never seen something so simple , do some proper maths, not foundation
foundation people are pepega
the way i got a D7 on mt GCE O level i hate math
Does this count as revision?
I remember taking this exact same test as a practice paper for revision before my GCSE's I was so confident after taking this test but when I went in for my GCSE exam.... i can't continue I still have PTSD from years ago 🙇
Foundation ffs
Fuck off is this what the foundation kids do
You did a set 8 paper
I'm pretty sure this is easier than the 11+ maths
George thinking he's a genius: iTs cLeArly CentImiTerS
*cries in bottom set maths*
I feel like me being in maths intervention was like James helping george
Me getting an 8 in my past paper: ez dub
Okay but the last page looked the most fun to do out of the entire paper.
The stem and leaf diagram😭✋🏽💀😂
Is this what the exam will be like? I was shitting myself, for this!? It's this easy!?
Oh wow u absolute mad lads, doing a maths exam for fun
I passed this exact test lmao
This is halarious
This video gave me exam anxiety flash backs.
this is my revision:)
I did the one with the sticks the other day actually
Fun fact, the last questions on the foundation papers are the first questions on the higher papers...for a point of reference   Also you either fail or get a 5/B or above with higher papers...like it’s impossible now to get a C
In gcse there is foundation, then intermediate, then higher..............and then of course further/additional. U should do additional next time
my gcses are sorted thanks to these two
i wish my higher tier non cal was that easy :(
Please try a higher tier
This......... high schoolers were expected to take this?
U guys have numbers?
Hi
F
this is so easy, do a cie igcse maths paper
I’m going my gcses this year and my teachers are trying to make me so the shite foundation paper lol I wanna see them try a higher paper because the difference is ridiculous
The range was 11
_why is there 3rd grade math on this high school exam_
Most definitely got the range question wrong😭
Edexcell is unbelievably easy
no wonder hes a youtuber
I wish this was my GCSE
I did this paper in school and it was a lot harder then this.
bruv do a higher paper
I'm doing the higher paper. That is when you feel pain😟
Do a higher maths paper
Bruh, in Romania we have an exam called bacalaureat and is kinda the same thing, but it's actually so hard..
Pls do an English paper
MOde is the MOst common number in the list
hey diddle diddle the median is in the middle, you and then divide for the mean, the mode is the one you see the most and the range is the difference between
I wanna see them fail a biology / chemistry paper so bad
I wish my maths exam was this easy wtf
i took this paper in yr 7... maths makes me want to die now its sm harder
wth this maths paper ppl now would acetheyve made it so hard noww
crying in alevel maths
I'm doing the higher maths paper please do that one instead of this shit
But he got the sixth question wrong..
Do higher maths
9:37 ,, is it not 11??
why is this a video though
The fact that they kinda helped me with maths ...
this has taught me more then all of my American education put together and i STILL didn't retain any of it
14:30 it’s 13/15 because you find the lowest common multiple of the denominators and then what you times the bottom and the top by the same thing do you get 10/15 and 3/15
10:47 any haikyuu fans here 🌝
that fact that this is a foundation paper too- 2010's gcse maths foundation tier oof. why did they pick to do 2010's exam papers?
If only they did the higher paper. Their brains would go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
now take a higher paper :)
I think George should do a dyslexia test
9:41 it’s actually 11
I’m American is gsce like the SAT ??
Watching James struggle with simple factorisation is painfull
Nah ain't no way this is maths 😂🤣😭
Me doing higher😡😡😡
oh... dear
Now do a GCSE further maths paper
My year 2 SAT’s were harder than this
you're telling me that i did a higher paper and this is what the foundation one looks like? jesus christ. please do more of these
its 15cm squared 6:00
Eboys maths exam in real life when?
the thing is, I'm not even that smart and I'm doing higher paper, so when I see people struggle on simple math question it fucks my brain
*15cm squared
I love how George is just hyped and his friends are just bored and don't wanna be here
should of marked it
5:50 sorry gorge centimetres squared mate This hurt me inside then James looked it up and I laughed
The fact that most of the people in my school failed the foundation paper is worrying
the different between foundation maths in 2010 vs now is shockinh
Me, a year 9 student, watching two 20 year olds figure out how to factorise: 😃
4:37 if pattern 5 = 11 and pattern 2 = 5 surely p5x2=22 + p2 = 27 so it’s not 25? But then also wouldn’t make sense as each pattern is +2 meaning it would be 25.
thats 2010, try a 2020 one
My science teacher is actually called R_____ Kelly so on my time table it says under science “Mr R.Kelly room n105”
that hurt my brain cells
you onky need 15 /80 marks on higher non calc to pass but you need 65/80 to pass on foundation non calc
if gcses were this easy today id be passing maths and not getting a 4
What maths level is this cuz my GCSE was not this simple
Jesus christ i now understand why people take foundation....
14:51 common multiple you crack heads.😂
I have a maths exam tomorrow so I’m using this as revision
Why did they pick the foundation one?? Of course George remembers it being harder, he didn’t take foundation
When George and James get to do another GCSE test when you’ve been barred from doing yours.
Aww so sweet of James to tutor a dyslexic kid in his spare time <3
15 - 4 is not 9
i wish my foundation tests came with built in james and george help
YO r u sure  this is GCSE
I'm a maths tutor and James explained how to multiply decimals better than me
revison
Foundation is genuinely the consolation prize. Like it's one thing to have questions like that, but it's another to teach students this content over the span of 2 years and those students aren't even that young, they're 16 when they take the test. Like it's funny when you see people take SATs test (like the one from when you're 10, not the American one) and the questions are hard because they're something you learn and then forget after not doing it for years, but these are like... There is no method to forget, it's just looking at numbers and writing them again. I mean some of these are remembering stuff, like the name of the angles so those ones are fair enough I guess, but the rest have got to just be there to make you feel good because you know the answer.
stem and leaf diagrams are piss easy
Why is this paper easier then my foundation paper wtf that’s so not fair
When people say factorising is the hard questions I start to worry
i just learned some math thanks
Right little bit of help here, you probably already know it  Hey diddle diddle, The median’s the middle, You add and divide for the mean, The mode is the one that you see the most, And the range is the difference in between
I signed in purely just to leave a comment. Awkward moment where you actually took this exact exam in your GCSE's. For anyone interested I got a C
do an english one
so its just me finding this hard... i need to do a paper LOWER than foundation ffs
This is like watching a dad teaching his son maths
as someone doing their gcses, it is so much harder than this now 😭
I did foundation maths and I can assure you our papers did not look like this in the final exam. This is like a mock paper that would literally be the easiest thing; then they’d throw you into the actual exam and you couldn’t make heads or tails of half of it because they never taught you. I failed my maths because of that reason. When I got to college I passed thankfully because my college teacher wasn’t incompetent like my secondary school one and covered everything we needed to know. Now a uni student so, fuck you secondary didn’t need you anyway
5:50 u forgot to put squared
Did this make anyone feel substantially less stupid than they actually are or is it just me 😂
I do A-level further maths and this video jus makes me do this 🤦‍♂️ but it’s entertaining
kite...
My current GCSE maths is a bit more complicated than this
This proves that we don’t need all of this shit in modern life
11:38 i had for homework
This is evil. True evil
Thats something I would've done in like.. grade 6-7 (I'm american)
Goodbye education.  School is a capitalist scam.  WHY IS THIS TEST SO EASY
I'm a GCSE tutor... and in this video James is me and George is the student going like whatttttt hahahah
George really did 15-4=9 for range
I failed nearly all my GCSEs (Maths including) because of two key factors:  - I was being bullied really badly. - I had a crippling porn addiction.  I’m actually still doing my maths GCSEs and I’m 19 and in my final year of college.
I'm trying to do my a-level maths revision while watching this and I'm just cringing
Istg this is foundation. Im in Year 9 and Set 1 so i beg i get dropped down so i can do the foundation 😂
they didn't even show the grade they got
AT LEAST MARK IT!!
you really fell off
Alternative title: 2 men 1 year 6 numeracy test
The final question on this test are the first ones on the higher paper...
Doing a foundation paper who are they foolin
The foundation paper is a scam imo. My maths teacher put my year 10/11 D/C borderline group onto the higher paper because you need to answer less questions correctly to pass the paper overall. If you do the easier stuff at the beginning and then 1 or 2 of the more "complex" stuff, easy C.   Instead of teaching us a ton of little things, he'd only focus on the first few pages and then spend weeks on 1 or 2 formulas, making sure we had it down. I don't think anyone in that class who attended the lessons / the exams failed, some even got Bs. Since then, the concept of the foundation paper has majorly pissed me off. I get how it can be useful for some kids, but for most D/C borderline kids it's unnecessary and restricting.
I have to take Statistics next semester in Uni and the fact that I couldn't do 90% of this test just proves that I'm shit in maths and I'm gonna fail next semester ✌
that exam is easy omg
I loved this video.
IVE LEARNT MORE FROM JAMES THAN MY ACTUAL MATHS TEACHERS
Watching this makes me feel so much better at maths lmao
Why is this actually helping me revise for my math paper pahahaha  😂
sure two dimensions have the same units as one dimension:)
See I know people that managed to fail this...
i beg you do an a level paper
Are you an English person or a Math person?
Foundation was 100% more difficult than this. This seems like life skills maths
Plss I'm in yr 8 and this is what I do in my tests (but harder?)            I'm in set 3
This caused me physical pain
do a higher paper
What is the range between 15 and 4? 11  George: ok so that’ll be 9.
try a higher one
mArK tHe FoCkin PAPERS witness your SHAME
when you did gcse foundation maths and struggled, and see comments of people bragging about how easy it is... I wish I could be you
they should do gsce higher.
its a foundation exam don't hype yourself up too much <3
Imagine having to do exams this year  (This post was made by the no JC gang)
Me doing foundation maths rn:  😌🚄
*Show your working*
As someone who’s doing A Level maths, this was stressful to watch  Edit: please do an A Level Maths or A Level Further Maths paper next
So I’m doing the higher paper and my friend is doing the foundation..........what the actual hell.
I'm embarrassed that the only one I don't understand is why would x2+1 find the sticks in pattern 100? :( end me.
AS maths next please
I will use this video as my revision
James would be a good tutor
I beg you to do a higher paper from last year or something, this was agonising. I did it all in my head.
Thick
Yooo 7th June is my mum’s birthday
2010 paper and foundation lucky fucks.
Now I might be dumb but I don’t remember my foundation exam being this fucking easy
Next do the pure maths p4 or fp3
Next do the pure maths p4 or fp3
The pain when he gets a question wrong 😧😧
When he rounded the 8100 number UP instead of down I knew it was over
Can’t we just play mymaths.
I really enjoyed this. It was good practice for my Math skills.
Results??
They'll be somebody in this comment section that did this very paper
They'll be somebody in this comment section that did this very paper
Wait till the kids find out maths really doesn't matter at all unless your field of work requires it.
He needs to do a more recent past paper
What mark did you get?
This is before New Labour's dummy papers were replaced by harder exams
do an A-Level further maths paper pls
"15 what?! 15 apples!" This brings back trauma
Alright next do a higher paper
Wait I wanna know what mark you got :(
there's a popular kind of fundraiser that musicians do where they give themselves like a month or a week to learn a completely new instrument and then they take the grade 1 exam, so like professional violinists taking grade one oboe, and if they get a certain mark they give that much to charity. Please, please do this with a whole bunch of GCSE papers. Just sit them cold and see what happens.
To be clear this is the foundation test and is dead easy theirs a higher test that is significantly more difficult
I can’t believe this is what foundation did back in 2010 this is some year 2 shit for real
I remember doing this test in school I swear I did it so many times, I still l remember the questions and recognise the paper.
GCSE maths paper, more like SATS maths paper
I'm in year 8 and was doing this 2 years ago.....
Oh if only gcse was this easy T~T The weekly tests I do are harder than this T^T
Me doing gcse maths higher paper non calc Q3. Trigonometry
When your parents ask you to watch someone educational and you watch this
they should take a gcse higher next
How was George doing this at gcse I was doing this at the start of year seven lmao
me : taking notes for what there like for in ike 2 years
Are gcses actually this easy bc I've been revising the wrong stuff
Using this as my revision for gcse’s
This might help with mode n shit:  hey diddle diddle , The median is the middle, You add and divide the mean, The mode is the one that appears the most, And the range is the difference between.
*Do a higher paper*
You should try doing one from a more recent year. They're much harder
I dont believe it's possible for anyone to be stupid enough to fail gcse maths, you have to be braindead
I'm in my fourth form and I hope my paper is as easy as this please
Do edexcel further maths igcse
anyone else has taken igcse's?
As a maths teacher who is the same age as you guys, this video made me proud of our generation. We truly peaked
I was in the lowest set maths at school, my teacher got me to do the higher tier so it would be easier to get a pass if we revised for some of the subjects I failed 😐
Watching this brought me back memories lol. I did the higher paper until year 8 when they moved me down a set because I suck at maths and ended up passing the foundation paper in year 11 by only 12 marks. Its been 3 years and I already forgot everything, shows how important maths is after school.
No because this is the kind of stuff I learn in my foundation maths class 😔 and I find it hard <\3
do the highert
Where’s the answers the fuckkk
they need to do a recent test  not one from 2010
We did 14:17 as our end of year exam in year 8...
bruh im year 8 and im cringing watching these two trying to do the easiest maths test ever,
I love these videos but wasn’t the happiest, can see how people will be offended as they think this is easy but some people find this difficult
as someone who does maths a level, this was hard to watch 😂😂❤️
It’s a foundation paper come on do higher
i remember these questions from year 2 sats
Stem and leaf diagrams are very simple lads.
id like to see them try an add maths paper you do it at 16 but its part of  the a-level course (and somethings in it you dont cover in a level)
is this actually the difficulty of a maths paper in england? ahahahahah
wow you didn't mark it bad video 0/10
Guys trust GCSEs are easy, honestly I didn’t revise for a few and still got a decent grade. These don’t really matter as much as a levels which are cancer
I learned more from this video than I have in my highschool math class
When you're doing higher and you're just sat there like: 😐
I’m studying for a further maths exam rn wtf I’m so jealous
Please do a higher paper I can use the video as revision
I nearly choked on my sour skittles watching this hahahaha
I'm watching two grown men doing a   gcse exam what in i doing with my life pls I need answers
I was one of those students where foundation was too easy for me and higher was too hard for me, I got grade c on both
im shit at maths and this looks easy. Someone please tell me, are foundation maths papers still this easy!?
I'm doing my A levels, and haven't done math in 2 years. FLASHBACKS
they got 8 a wrong
I find this so funny my brother got a 3 in maths because of lockdown and this is how easy it is 😭
This is year 7 maths I stg
okay... why?
the fact i had to practice this paper in like y10 lol and pass it before theyd let us all do the other
Do a higher maths paper. The difference in difficulty is amazing
I may have done foundation, got a 5 easy clap. The first question was "name an odd number"
The foundation slander in this comment section is really fun ✋😔😂
Foundation paper is definitely allot harder now
This is handy for my revision
I've done that and I'm in Year 8 lol
Umm, thats for 2010. A decade and nearly a year ago 😶
now take a 2019 paper
9:36 15-4=11.. not 9
im taking my gcses this year.. *sobs in additional maths*
Centimetres SQUARED George you dill
15-4=9 nice
So you man were doing this while I struggled to find out the angle in a triangle using trigonometry😭😭
its the fact they did foundation lmao
We did practice foundation papers in year 4...
do A-Level maths
Foundation lol
I'm taking higher maths and further maths (a-level and gcse) and this video made me want to kill myself but it also made me feel like a genius
Alright so I'm going to class this as revision for my "GCSEs"
What mark did u get , did u pass?
i was wondering why it was so easy.. then i remembered that gcse’s get harder and harder every year since the curriculum change
normally i always do higher papers and so this is the first time ive ever seen a foundation paper and holy shit it looks so easy
This cannot be real! My seven year old is learning this level of maths right now!! My 11 year old could easily smash this test.. his year 2 SATS maths questions were more complex than this!
uhhh isn't the range 11? it's 15-4 yeah? or am i just tripping
@9:36 lol he got it wrong
Why are you doing foundation smh do higher...
I took foundation 2 years ago and the paper was not that easy, this is some bullshit.
As a trainee teacher... this hurts so much
This can’t be a gcse maths paper hell no
Bruh is foundation really this easy? I hate my maths teacher so much.
me at 9:00 : hey diddle diddle the medians the middle, you add and divide for the mean. the mode is the one that you see the most and the range is the difference between.
This was easier  then my sats paper in primary school
next time do a higher paper and see how it goes
get james on Gcse spanish higher paper
This gives me faith that I will pass my GCSE'S lol
babe you guys are 10 years late times changed
If you told me this test paper was a year 7 end of unit test I'd believe you
Wish my maths exams were this easy jesus, want me to calculate the distance from Earth to the Sun divided by how many people have crack addictions.
I’m 11 and this paper looks easy.
Please do a 9-1 GCSE maths paper because this is very easy in comparison to the new GCSE maths paper
My lord the range question too
Me in Asia doing these questions in year 5 being hella envious of the British
I really fucking sat here to watch 2 grown British men do a math test.........
Not gonna lie, this video made me feel dumb 😂😅
I just realised that I got this test as just a normal test not GCSEs- I’m guessing this is a quite old paper so no wonder why it’s pretty easy and that I got it as a normal test
It’s great to see that George’s development is coming along so well. He’s thriving especially considering his circumstances. In fact I think he could pass as developmentally on-track in the right scenarios x
i failed this 3 times 4th times the charm
Going into this I was expecting George to get bullied. By the end I realised in fact it was james
I wish foundation maths was still this easy... Im barely passing and I'm supposedly the smartest in my class 😭
Range is 11 wtf 😳
I love how he's so confident about the range being 9 and its just not
I swear I did a paper like this in year 7 😂
I learned this stuff in, like, year five or something        I dont know
19:29 i care james. 😔 i care 🤚🏻
Now they should try an a level one...
I think they meant sats maths test
the range is 11 right?
They got question 8 a wrong it's actually 15cm(2) (squared)
Gorge is definitely a bottom to james but a top to alex he is in the middle
all my gcse's were foundation cause i suck at exams LMAO
WELL THE PAPERS FROM 2010 WHAT DO U EXPECT 😭😭
What the hell is this? I had these tests in year 7
I swear the Year 6 SATs were harder than this.
the pain of u getting the multiplying fractions question wrong is unreal
seriously, how stupid do you have to be to fail this sh*t, wtf
I need to retake my math...
doing higher, this foundation paper looks so easy 😔
pls do a higher tier maths exam
bruh i remeber doinmg this in skool i ddnt pas thouh hahah f
You truly have derailed into madness, haven't you George
Jesus Christ compare this to higher 2020 papers
am i the only one who used this as exam revision?
compared to today's papers this is child's play
“Expand and simplify (y+4)(y+5)”  *six*
Everyone else watching: 😂😂😂  Me (a teacher) watching: 😳🤬🤯💀
someone put me down a set- i wanna do the foundation paper plz
“What is a mode?” I’m shouting at the screen
This is more so one of them tests you do in year 7 maths to see how good you are.
Great do higher GCSE or Alevel
What the fuck? My GCSE maths had fucking matrices
Using this as revision thanks me me 👍🏻
You can only get a D on a foundation paper. You need intermediate to get higher than a D at the maximum of a B
little did they know this was actually a Yr6 SATS test
The fact I still failed this multiple times in school is extremely embarrassing hahaha
I'm disappointed that you didn't go through the answers
I’m literally learning about all this because I’m a year 9 lol
16:42 erm yeah... got that
Jesus it was so much easier in 2010 omg
I want them to try an alevel maths paper and watch them cry
The brain cells I lost from watching this video
Do this with a higher paper
yoo my mocs was not as easy as this 😂😂😂
As a Maths teacher this is difficult to watch
GCSE Maths  Ha thats nothing try GCSE french my guy
okay, but now try a set 1 higher paper...
If this is foundation why is higher tier on some much meth
1:36 You can't round up sheep! (Actually you can, LOL)
Perimeter was 12cm, not 16cm. Was it not?
no way this isn't a foundation paper
is it just me or are gcse papers a lot harder than this
As a year 11 student this is so funny to me, coz I can see where I'll be in 10 years even though the idea of getting these questions wrong now seems so weird
knowing me i'm still gonna fail foundation
No way were people crying over tests like these
why are they doing GCSE foundation paper, higher is better, a 10 year old could probably do foundation
I just probably failed my pre calculus test so I'm here watching this again 😭😭😭😭
Cm SQUARED! Lmao
this is so embarrassing how did you think this was okay to upload-
This is easier then what i do in year 9 wtf
Got French and Spanish mocks next week wish me luck
Ah yes, the invigilator, the crusher of every British 16 year old's dreams.
I really want you to do the Higher Maths Paper now xD
Me who still struggled with the foundation paper😂 like I didn’t struggle with everything on it but I still only got a 2
Mode is the most common is easier to remember 😂
I like that we just dont know if any of that was correct, should go through the answers at least? Haha
i would love to see them try my higher maths paper i did yesterday lmao
How is this video getting views?
You can tell this video is about math because it's _exactly_ 20 minutes long
Foundation Paper is pointless. Everyone should do higher because it's so easy to get a C on higher, and you may even have a chance to get s higher grade
this just reminds me of spending hours with my maths tutor "that's right george!"
13:48 gets me every time
quadererlateral
I failed intermediate paper and I think I would fail the foundation paper as well. I know i did foundation numeracy and i had to redo it at least three times until I was in college, covid happened and I had a good teacher who liked me and decided to finally give me a pass. I now try my best to avoid doing maths as much as I can because of how much I hated it
I’m a sophomore. I could do this
I’m in yr 9 and studied maths in welsh (so I don’t know English terms) AND I thought these questions were easy 😂😂
A level soon
please do gcse biology they have the funniest questions
I took foundation in year 10 MOCs and there's no way it was that simple, that's questions u would ask the kid that says there going to work instead of coming into school
I'm pretty sure I'm failing maths but this made me feel smart
Examiner not invigilator
you need to do papers from recent years
Don’t mind me, just doing a-level maths and wondering how it got so much worse
If my exams were this easy, I'd actually pass them.
1:12 if i am not wrong, it's not the invigilator who check the papers, it's the examiner.
I didn't even know what was stem and leaf diagram was so I drew a leaf
Its 4:40 am I'm really out here spending my weekend watching George and James do math..
james whered you get your hoodie
So basically this is my sats paper
Who else didn’t do their gcse cuz of COVID?
The fact George does his k’s like that makes me so sad
Mum : “YOU STUDYING???” Me : “I’m doing maths” Me in my room :
Range was 11
I done the one where you can only get a B in Year 9 (2 years earlier than you normally took GCSEs) just so I could quit Maths & do more GCSE PE even though I was great at Maths. Ended up with an A* in PE, probably wudda got that anyway but it was nice being able to quit that and RE early (RE just cos it's shite) and being able to play Football with the PE classes in my spare periods. Parents were a bit disappointed I didn't go for the Maths A* that they'd taught me to get since I could speak lol but I had fun.
fuck yes i am so down for this series
I just want to say i'm less than half their age and i got more questions correct than them. This is maths we would have gotten in year 3 or 4
****** IMPORTANT FOR THOSE WHO CARE*********  The reason this was easy was because this paper was made in 2010, you probably took an later one George when the curriculum became harder because the government are bad at education
5:45 *cm squared
I redid maths twice in sixth form and I swear the paper was harder
Okay, I’m not good at maths, i wish my maths paper were this easy
Somehow it’s not too unbelievable that Tanaka-kun is bad at mathematics
I’m currently doing my GCSE’s and I swear I did these papers in year 6 😹
Answers for 18:21 in case anyone wants to know:  A) 3(x+4)  B) x = 19/3 = 6.33 (2 d.p)  C) y^2 + 9y +20  You're welcome.
Omg!! This was my maths gcse exam aswell!?! Like I just got flashbacks when I saw that bar graph on the first page...
this really is a 20 min math video lol. i thought he was kidding 😂
Oh god it’s a foundation paper
I'm in year 9 and there is literally only 2 question which I can't do
james would have made fun of me in school for being in the lower set maths class, probably with george
This was like a really shit version of Countdown. Still loved it though.
I would kill to abandon double var calculus for this. It's just so straightforward. More things in life should be like that.
The range being 9 was said with such chest, despite being 11😭😂
2010 of course it’s easy...
This one is so much easier than my foundation ones
Quick maths!
I'm in 4th set, we do the foundation paper why the actual fuck are we doing trigonometry😀
Apparently the comments section is full of geniuses who know how to “factorize” or whatever
pls there’s no way this is a gcse paper
should've gone on the main channel, big g
This whole video made me relive every failed maths exam I took. On actual gcse maths I got an E-, and yes I do think the minus part is personal
It should be centimetres squared for area
I can’t believe this was actually a paper lool.
Can you do the igcse edexcel paper 2 higher tier next Thanks
Y no going over answers
“2.5 x 36 = 18” Lol what
8:15the way he said bracket😂
8:58 BRUH INCORRECT THE COLON THING IS NOT RIGHT
2010 papers tho, gonna be easier ofc, I did the 2019(?) foundation paper - it was a mock for my final one but bc of covid no real exam but with the changes in education and stuff since like 10 years difference...yeah it's harder now, but I got an easy C. Foundation isn't that hard, I just couldn't be arsed to do higher bc it's that much harder
I was so convinced it was 13 sheep, looks like i'm not passing my higher tier paper
2:06 THAT'S NOT EVEN RIGHT JSJSJSJJSJSJSJSJS ITS THREE THOUSAND TWENTY NOT THREE THOUSAND *AND* TWENTY LOL
1:29 how is meat made then?
I'm 13 and know more than these lads
and yet we have to take the SATs here in the states that are piss harder
I fell asleep in my maths gcse .... I got a 4 instead of a 6 😎
I thought james was smart
watching this after doing an a level maths exam is very brain numbing
me wishing i was on foundation rn, i have mocks in 3 week :(
This looks 10x easier than 2020 ones like wtf, they had it so easy in 2010!
I lost brain cells watching this
huh. maybe i can pass my maths gcse  edit: im fucked
I might be able to pass now u 2 taught me more than the teachers do
Think the range Is 11 lads
i clicked on this video thinking i might get some idea of what my maths gcse will be like but i've just gained confidence. maybe i, the girl who got 9/36 on my eom assessment can pass my maths gcse <3
This makes me sick I’ve been trying to do my foundation gcse for three years the ones they give to us now are even harder
I say try the higher paper
“This is easy” me with my extra time making mistakes
lol foundation
“4 x 7 = 24” George 2021
Why is this exam so easy I'm sure it should be harder
This is the shit we were doing in year seven lol
That’s year 6 sats not GCSEs
Didn’t get told bout this vid
Try doing an access3 paper for your gcse 😭😭😭 I was stupid, only mark you get it PASS 😂😂
The fact that I had to do a foundation paper is staggering, haven’t done maths in 3 years and I’m 99% sure I would of done better then I did
..did george just say 15-4 is 9...
james at the start was just like " let me just clarify, this is the paper that you took if you were below average intelligence, yeah I've just never had to do it, do people like that exist? and they're not good at simple arithmetic, ok, if you say so"
i could do this as a set 2 year 8
U should do a modern paper
Something tells me my GCSE maths paper will not be this simple
I do alevel maths and this was amusing. Do higher next time
They got c-
I IMPLORE that you do an edexcel maths higher paper from around 2018 onwards, that shit is HARD AF!
They got 84/100 which is a C
i did this test before :/
Are you sure this wasnt a SATs paper?
Lmaooo they should’ve marked it
this is revision for most of their audience
i hope my foundation maths paper is like this
oh for gcses to be this easy
I want to see more of these for sure
...bruv this isn't a GCSE paper wtf I did this for like my year 6 SATs
How did I get a 7 in maths is questionable
The a level maths students are shaking...
i swear we did this stuff in p4-6 in scotland, i thought gcse’s were the english versions of nat 5’s?
This is sad
As a fellow high school student, this upsets me. Alot.
Are you sure this exam isn't the year 6 sats LOLL, I refuse to believe this is a gcse exam despite it being for the foundation tier
why didn’t you mark it 😩😩😩
Lol, Im in ordinary maths class in Ireland for the Leaving Cert, i am incapable of anything to do with maths as hard as this
tell me why george memeulous has just helped me with angles
9:15 "Have you ever had a dream like this" James addition.
George: why do people call me thick? Also george: *says 4% is higher than 2% on the library question*
Please do more gcse papers they’re everything especially as I never actually got to take mine😂
istg i did these level questions in year 4😭
Bruh foundation, should of done higher
They got 0 marks because they cheated here---> 6:25
I think I remember this test from year 4
I'm year 10 Having to do foundation because I'm one of the dumbest in my set 7 class (at least I'm not set 9 lmao) - Not looking forward to it x
Yeah, they should try a recent higher tier paper and THEN see how that goes :-(
Whatever this paper is, I’m pretty sure most eleven year olds could get above 80% lmao 😂 Some of the questions even primary school kids would be able to do. They should try do a further maths a level paper and see if they can even get one mark 🤣
I am a maths student and I was physically cringing at this but you should try doing a GCE (A-level) maths mechanics paper, you're brain will explode
As someone in year 11 doing higher I cannot believe what a fucking piss take GCSEs used to be
9:36 work out the range (15-4)  George: that’ll be 9 😬😬😬
Thats embarrassing
they should do this again but with a higher paper
why did james phrase it like that why didn’t he just say the mode is the most common number
swear it was much harder when i did it last year 😅
Yo what is this gcse paper bc i want it
watching this before my multivariable calculus class
Do a video marking this
i love u george
do a higher test next
I flopped my A-level maths paper today but this makes me feel like the next Pythagoras
Wtf my GCSEs are like 50x harder
Looks like foundation to me, u can only get up to a 5 on that paper
Do a higher paper pls
I'm in year 11 doing foundation and the test I did today was much harder then this XD
if only the gcses nowadays were this easy 🧍🏼‍♀️ i’m gonna fail all of the higher papers next year frfr. yolo though
Wtf I’m doing GCSEs now I wish I was doing this instead
Ok but i find it really annoying that james is being a know it all but he doesn't know it's cm² like... ur both just as bad...
Can someone tell me the age of the students who write this paper. I'm from a different country and i don't know how gcse's work.
5.55 cm squared not cm since its the area
I just did a higher paper for an assessment and I literally sat in the classroom and cried for about 20 minutes
Lol I’m taking one of these next month but on higher tier. I’m gonna die :D
"I hope he's wearing a mask"
*2 idiots attempt basic maths*
this was once a cringe comment from when i was in secondary and i regret it
omg james boasts about going to a grammar school but doesn't know what an acute is I'm in year 7 and can answer more than half of these
lets see you mark it then
i feel dumb
‘that’ll be nine’  answers clearly 11
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping everyone from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
I was the last year to sit GCSE exams... I’m now finishing my A-Levels. I was the last year to actually sit their maths exams, and that was in 2019...
No offence, but I think this is a year 8 or 9 test lmao. Would still be super easy then  Edit: I know think this was not GCSE, but rather sats
maybe i should move to the uk that shit is easy
Anyone else get a 4 in maths?
"What the fuck is a stem and leaf diagram?" I've been in high school for 5 years and I still don't know.
In y7 I did a gcse foundation paper and it was a lot harder questions than this 🤣
9:42 I love the confidence George says 9, when the answer is 11 lmaoo
gcse english
why did i  watch this
I did igcse 9-1 Edexcel higher tier
George saying quadrilateral is the funniest thing
the fact I did this test in year 8 set 4
this is a primary school level test wtf
dont be shy take one post michael gove
this is literally the test i did for my year 6 SATs
i did the foundation maths paper in 2019 🥺🥺🥺🥺
I wanna see their grade also James can never be called smart again after looking up the units for area
This has big ‘kid explains his homework to his big brother’ energy
Please do the current foundation paper to compare
I barely got a C in gcse math by 1 mark - and i sat the Higher Paper 😂👏✨
Good luck to those who are counting this as revision for their GCSEs surely!
Came to you to relax after school... and this is what you do to me youtube??!
i am going to use this for revision ty
No I fucking don’t
Petition for the Eboys to take higher GCSE maths paper then send it to Mr Mahmud to see who's better at maths
wow school was ez back then
you should do the gcse biology paper for 2019, they pulled some weird shite on us
Is anyone going to point out at 9:40 the range is 11 not 9 because 15-4=11
Wait wtf is this is it still this easy and I actually refuse to believe that this was for a qualification lmao
Me an American not understanding what people mean by “year #” because im dumb: 👶👍
My last maths test/exam was very unpoggers. I got 12%
😭I’m doing my actual maths gcse in 2 weeks
This was painful
Jesus I wish this was what my maths GCSE paper looked like
I did stuff like this in yr 9
Omg they actually just did some damn homework for a video and James actually took it seriously
17:29 I'm pretty sure they got q26 wrong
How did you make math good content?
This is Nostalgia.
watching this video really made me realise how bad i am at maths
Water
As someone who does 2 of these tests a day, this is painful to watch lol
This is proof of why George doesn’t pay the tax man
Please do combined science next
Try a later maths paper for foundation
I beg do the higher paper :')
16 a Came up in my year 7 bottom set exam LMFAO
So glad I did foundation got my c and left lmao
Oh this is the foundation appear though , I would love to see one on higher tier lol

How tf is it this easy
It cant be this easy.
Do gcse imedia lol
I feel like I walked into the set 8 class
It was 15cm2
i do not remember it being this easy-
hold the fuck on. As an american constantly hearing about gcses i always assumed they were somewhat difficult. like maybe on the level of AP. what is this
I wish this was my exam
Yeet
Do the higher paper that’s what I’m doing rn and it’s not that easy 🤣🤣
Lovely to see a dad helping his son to revise 🤗
Not too sound mean but you literally have a twenty ten GCSE paper which because it’s age is considered easy by everyone even people taking the modern foundation paper because the curriculum has got harder year by year
Do more please
I am in year 7 and I could confidently answer all of these
George and James.... i thought you guys had GCSEs.... i couldve solved those when i was in 3rd grade....
do IGCSE next
Just so everyone knows in England they use numbers rather than letter grades now, so they wouldn't get a C they'd get like 5 or some shit. Bunch of weirdos
They keep making fun of this but I'm pretty sure they wouldn't get the C... They really struggled at some points😶
The reality we can't ignore;  1. When you die the real you( the spirit inside your body) either goes to Heaven or hell. 2. Who goes to hell? those who don't believe at Christ as the savior. e. Who goes to Heaven? Those who believe at Christ as the savior.   Realise that you deserve hell for your sins;  Romans 6:23 plainly states that the wages of sin is DEATH. In Genesis 2:17 God warned Adam and Eve that they would die THE DAY they ate of the forbidden fruit. They disobeyed God, but didn't DIE physically until hundreds of years later. Why? It's because they DIED SPIRITUALLY that awful day, and all mankind has been born spiritually dead since (Romans 5:12). Please understand that spiritual death and the second death are not the same. Every person who is not born again is ALREADY spiritually dead. The second death is Gehenna, i.e., the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11-15). All those who die in their sins, without being born again( that is believing that Jesus Christ got crucified and shed his blood for their sins, buried and rose again in the third day and alive now in heaven), will be arraigned, prosecuted, and sentenced at The Great White Throne of Judgment and then cast into the Lake of Fire forever.   Believing at Christ does not involve worship of other gods(church leader&ancestors), object(hand bands,car stickers,trees e.t.c) Muhammad,buddha e.t.c. It's only believing at Christ as the perfect sacrifice for your sins. It's your choice but know that rejecting Christ will send you the wrong direction.   Hebrews 10:4, 10 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.   Any other form of sacrifice be it animal sacrifices it can't save you but we are only saved through the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ.  No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what Jesus Christ did for you as simple as that.   Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.  In other words if you want to go to heaven after your death you must confess with your mouth and believe that Jesus Christ was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and was buried but risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now.  After believing at Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c.  Romans 6:10-11 For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.  As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life.  Also grow in the word; I suggest the following YouTube channels; Real bible believers, Robert Breaker and Pastor J.D Farag..
wow even I could get a good score
*laughs in extended*
you sure this isnt the year 6 sats paper 😃
Fuck will ... Lenny! let's have more George n James! Only doin quick maths plz
Anyone else get extremely pissed off they didn't write the area number in the correct format? (as 15cm^2) lmao
Ravver stchewpid innit, makin a videauw abou' mafs. nobo'ey gonna wotch that.
Not me only just now, at the ripe age of 19, finding out how to do ratio because of James Marriott. thanks lol.
I done this paper last year and I don’t remember it being this easy 💀🤦🏻‍♀️😂😂
Nice, now do the higher papers.
How could ANYONE fail this
Needs to do some which actually mark him so we see how good/bad he dose
The fact that I learnt this all in S1 and 2010 kids had it for gcse/national 5 is killing me, I got full fucking marks 😂
I’m going to move to England to do exams because I did work in primary school more difficult than this shit
didn't even go through the mark scheme smh
James u got the acute question right I was sat here goin no way James don’t know that’s a acute angle
We really just watched two guys do a math test for 20 minutes
MARK ITTTTTTT PLEASE XD
you should do a higher paper
5:55 centimetres squared GEORGE  Watched on realised James fixed it 😂
Is it bad I actually did this paper
This is going to be my revision for my mocks
About to do a proper Maths GCSE and this has giving me confidence by comparison because you’re just so unbelievably bad
Why do I actually feel like I’ve learnt something?
It APALLS ME how many they got wrong and didnt realise it
4:54 was 2x+1 as in the nth term shit.. This is so painful
15 cm squared
**quaderalateral**
My sister failed this exam 5 times in 2011
George your so stupid the mode was 4
I'm in top set maths in year 8 and doing quadratic equations and straight line equations and rearranging it this feels like year 5 again
That is the dumbest exam I’ve seen
This is definitely foundation
even though this was 11 years ago this is stupid easy ngl
I'm offended looking back at how easy GCSEs used to be wtf
Tbh, that was actually really helpful
I think you need to do a higher tier paper
no way this is gcse 😂
OK im in year 11 and I can tell you this is not what we have to do. Where did you find this paper?
Higher tier papers are so much harder than this
Thats the easiest 5 ever
I did a similar paper to this in my academy exam it wasprettyballocks tbf
Learn maths from school ❌ Learn maths from george and james ✅
I'm so happy he put maths and not math
I have to do higher maths so I got the extra stuff like Surds, trigonometry, histograms, probability, quadratic formulaes. I hate maths im on a grade 5 :/
Boi if my Grade 9 maths teacher had you 2 in her class, she wouldn't even be angry, just confused.
I probably took a harder maths exam for my 11+
as someone who did foundation papers for my gcses a few years back these papers so SO easy it was the only exam i enjoyed doing
Wait, I really wanted to know how many they got right!
I'm in second year A-level maths. I miss Maths being this easy
Bruh! Why the foundation test. Do the higher maths test lmao.
id love to see them do a higher paper
please do a science one!!!😭😭😭
Hey I remember this from year 5
11:08 vertically opposite
It was actually 15cm2. 15 cm squared.  Big lad memelous
range: *is 4-15* george: *nInE*
Rumor has it, James Marriot is still re sitting his maths to this day
People actually fail this. Damn some people are stupid.
Do the gcse maths higher
i have found another opportunity to say how covid allowed me skip to my gcses last summer, feel sorry for you guys doing them this summer. good luck
Hey diddle diddle, the median's the middle, you add and divide for the mean. The mode is the one that you see the most and the range is the difference between.
Foundation tier😭😭😭
Question 8a) would actually be 15cm squared I’ll have you know 😡 Fuck I just watched 5 seconds later
9:42 the way the range isnt even 9
Shout me for GCSE maths and spanish tuitions xoxoxo
try a scottish national 5 paper lol its way harder
that’s not a gcse paper 😂😂😂
5:52 15cm^2 george !!!
we love an educated man
I'm menna b revising for maths rn ig this counts
Me watching this doing my maths foundation paper tomorrow ✏✏✏✏✏✏
George in Set 8
“15 centimetres!”
George is a set 8 kid
Thank you james for explaining ratio to me in a way I understand 🙏
These are so easy and I’m in year 9
Not me actually finally learning how to solve ratio  because james is good at explaining despite being in my 3rd year in uni 🙊🙊🙊👀👀👀
Content.
Hi
Anyone else actually find this helpful because schools are using last years exam papers
i'm in Y11 right now and WHY IS THIS SO EASY? I'M DOING THE HIGHER PAPER WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT AND THIS IS SO EASY T-T
Shame there wasn’t a question on pi r squared
I’m convinced aqa was scamming us
Foundation lol
You say teeth not teeths so tell me why do you say maths not math. The TH makes it plural!!!!!
Do an English paper you get make some great content out of that
When they did the probability question wrong the answer is 5:4
Me watching this during my mocks and counting it as revision
This is the type of test you would take to see if you are ready for primary school
I do GCSEs and this is so easy compared to what I do. Jealous for the people who did it cause I have to do higher
This is year 6 level shit
This is good video make another and that would be epic am I s cool person for speaking like this
did a mock higher paper yesterday and it was literal rocket science compared to this
thank you, now in two years i will get full marks in the GCSE paper
please do a higher paper
5:55 thats wrong
I'm so glad that I don't have to go through with my GCSE's this year.. If I had to do this I'm finished
I have dyscalculia and I got a 5 (high c)
OMG THX I FORGOT HOW TO DO MODE AND I HAS A MATH EXAM BEFORR THIS LMAO I WATCHED THIS IN THE SCHOOL TOILET
Jame's voice cracks are on point
do a higher paper next time
how can you be this idiotic love the videos but really
They should do a more up to date maths paper.
Why isn’t my maths foundation paper looking like that? 😐
This was painful
It feels like a chore watching this the numbers are torturing my brain
*q u a d e r i l a t e r a l*
I care that James knows, George.
Lmao this looks like the maths sheet I use to do in primary 4! 🤣😎
im gonna be choosing my gcse options soon shiT-
this is the easier one as well
Fam 🤦‍♂️... this is Y6 stuff the stuff I am doing in Y10 rn is nothing like like this!
All I was waiting for was the circle song
IM SCREAMING I DID THIS PAPER FOR MY GCSES WTF
this feels like a set 8 maths lesson
This boosts my self-esteem
The wonders of foundation papers.
Great vid as always
You should try doing the further maths GCSE paper because that's such a big jump...
FYI for the people confused, there is a foundation tier GCSE paper which they are doing in the video. It is bascically done by students who are weak in maths and want to get good grades. The students are selected by the school. Also, the actual GCSE paper is honestly not this easy.
I think by gcse they meant year 6 test
okay, but did you pass?
Giving me faith to pass my GCSEs , thanks lads
this video radiates set 5 energy
Thought I recognised this paper... it’s the same paper I took in 2010 🤣
i have a gcse maths exam tomorrow lol
I have never seen 2 men so considerate
this isn’t a gcse paper it is a year 8 paper that you do in class😂
Q8. Area is usually measured in length^2 but alpha Big George M doesn’t give a sh*t
I swear I did something like this for my year 6 SAT’s
This is literally primary skl shit
please do higher maths omg
I literally had one of my Spanish gcse tests today
This Video Giving Me PTSD
How many people that want to see you do higher maths  👇🏻
I think this is a year 6 GCSE
I just realised i’m better at maths than 2 over 20 yr olds
Can you show you going through the answers as it explains alot of things
theres no way this is a GCSE exam. I had tests harder than this is year 3 and  was in like the bottom set then
This was the most painful thing I've watched in a while
I’ve failed GCSE maths 3 times and this is stressing me out
i did foundation maths and what an experience it was
Oooooh someone stealing ideas from dropouts
Da
forgot to show your workings 🙄🙄
You know as someone who is currently struggling in pre calculus this made me feel smart for the first time since I took statistics so thank you for that
Oml a 2010 foundation paper... This is literally year 7-8 level these days.
if this was the GCSE in 2010 I’d love to see the GCSEs when my dad was at chook
i could have done this when i was 11
George struggles to do simple addition
Write an English essay on how the relationship of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth is presented and have us mark it
I repeated mine 10+ times, so much that it’s a running joke between me and my mates - and here I am in university without it (no clue how the fuck I got here because it was a requirement?) - basically, I fucked the system.
Only if this was my actual gcse exam I may have passed if it was cause they were so easy
I have had 2 maths exams, I have my last exam Friday, it’s calculator tho which I find easier than non calculator. This is so funny for me to watch as a GCSe student.
If only my GCSE's were this easy. Instead people out here going on about surds...
Oh my gosh they would freak out at the shit we are doing in math class right now if they struggled with those questions
higher tier 💪💪
This looks like a year 2 test
Omfg this is so easy can I have this paper for my GCSEs in a few months pleeaaase
I want to see them take my latest maths exam lmao
At least someone is doing GCSEs exams this year
Do the higher paper
like james said it's giving me a headache.
Hey diddle diddle the medians the middle You add and divide for the mean  The mode is the one that you see the most  And the range is the difference between
George and James bully people who didn’t get a C on the maths foundation paper
Why did I enjoy this
foundation maths is just a logic test tbh
James is the dad we all need
How do people actually fail maths then???
Mr Meme took my idea
MathSssSS
I’m a second year in Mechanical Engineering in the best engineering school in my state, and watching them try some of these problems (mainly the last one) was painful
Please don’t do an English paper
At what age, do people generally take this exam?
I want them to review their answers next time with an answer key 😂
George... this is a grade 5 mid year exam.
this must be an old spec paper its way too easy jeeez
After Science, can you do History. Why? I just like it lol.
Set 8 in a nutshell
Bruh imagine doing foundation i did higher i say i did it but corrona did it for me and i got a 6 (B) without doing anything lol
as a 11th grader this hurt me that george took this as a year 10.... this is some shit they’d give me in like 7th grade
but it's...... it's 3 tenths.
as a former foundation maths paper taker i can confirm the questions weren’t this easy😂
Half expecting George to sing the circle song
my gcse foundation had hard shit like expanding brackets and equations
idk if it’s just because i’m in 12th grade but those factoring questions are very easy i’ll give them a pass since they haven’t done math in awhile 😩😩
Can you post a part 2 where you check your answers?
I just did my maths exam today       I only wrote my name in the paper😎👌
Eboys do maths papers and see who does the worst
And why wasn’t this my gcse exam, all mine was algebra 😔✌️
Do my paper ib math standard level
It’s at times like this where I’m extra glad I’m done with math for the rest of my schooling career
can this count as my gcse revision?
5:49 all the annoying kids coming into the comments to tell george that it’s 15 cm squared and not 15 cm
Thank you for making me feel like Einstein lads, very cool
There’s a reason James was chosen for this video over Alex and Will
Surely you attempt a higher math gcse paper
Watching this video for revision
I have to do my math finals in a month in Germany and I’m literally crying because I wish I had this Exam
Me doing mechanics and pure mathematics in A levels 👁👄👁
I am procrastinating revising for my maths mock while watching this
The difference between foundation and higher is fucking ridiculous. Higher paper was so hard, we weren't even taught everything for the paper
Bro Edexcel is one of the harder papers lmao at you.. shoulda done AQA
New title : James helps George with his math homework :v)
You both should be embarrassed of yourselves.
This is so painful
Highest form of human knowledge, we have reached the peak of the human brain
this is just a kindergarten reading session wtf i thought these were harder
I mean I'm awful at maths and failed my math GCSE.. but surely it wasn't this easy??? I can't remember it being that easy or am I really that dumb 😅  Edit: the 2nd half of the paper... Had no clue what they were doing. I'm dumb.
15 - 4 = 9
this made me optimisfic about doing my gcse
Even the AQE is easier than this tf
When u realise the answer for the second last question was actually 7 👁️👄👁️
“This isn’t very riveting content” Yes it is, thank you James and George
I’m classing this as revision
I love maths, I enjoy maths, I never cry while doing math.
Wtf lol I wish I done this exam kmt
I could do that in 4th grade(10 years old in romania)
I wanted them to mark it god damn it
this test is so easy you could give it to the lowest level year five in the entire fucking cohort and they’d blitz it
This gives me ptsd
Please do more exam papers
To all Americans watching this these are the 2 dumbest people from the UK we like to watch them try to do things
And people got a C for this??
the funny thing is the second to last question he acc got right
thanks for the maths lesson geogr
I feel like I’ve learned something from this but incorrectly so I’m fucked
USA test are harder than this
you have to do the higher maths test
Wow u had it easy
this is going to help me with my non existing exams
Needless to say I am worried, GCSE chemistry would break these two
A level pure math paper let’s goooooo
Gcse maths paper 2010: can you read a graph
Interesting to see George’s writing style
My year 4 maths test was harder than this and I was 10
I want them to do a 2019 paper now and *cry*
at least mark the paper
Hey diddle diddle the medians the middle you add and divide for the mean the mode is the one you see the most and the range is the difference between
I did something like this in year 5 and get something like 90% tf is this
I think you should do a higher paper, It wouldn't necessarily be fair though, but it would be fun to see.  I'm honestly shocked as to how different they are.
That is foundation for you haha
try any kind of a level maths paper, and trust me you will feel suicidal by the end of it - so glad im at uni now and don't have to think about another bloody stats question ever again
Year eights watching this vid for entrance exams
a spanish one
these questions were literally on my y6 sats fucking hello??
i’m only 9 seconds in and i saw foundation and they’re just weak
why did i watch this why
Currently in year nine And this feels like it could be a year 6 exam
This is hella ez lmao
This is easier than my maths in year 6
Y = Mx+c?
Was watchin this all on my own enjoying it until my sister comes over and say that James looks like Jack Black 😑
New video, Eboys sit GCSEs
I swear I did this paper in like elementary school for my state test...... like literally 4th or 5th grade  14:06 I legitimately have done that EXACT question wtf
450
I didnt get the notification
9:42 is 11 lol
I'm in first year and I found that piss easy
this made me feel so old. it’s been 5.5 years since I left high school and did my last maths class. I have yet to use most of the maths I learned. the basics yes, averages, perimeter and area, things like that... but I’ve yet to use 99.9% of it.
We had to do a paper like this in primary, what are they feeding you?
Should’ve got William Lenny to Mark it
Can't believe I watched 20 minutes of GCSE math.
This is literally year 4 maths
9:41 he got it wrong
Yes i want a science one pls
Watching this before my English exam wish me luck
My sats we’re harder than this
Taking my GCSEs this year and am watching this video to help me. Thanks for the help George.
This just made me realise that I dont need to be scared of gcse’s
george: why’s everyone calling me thick everyone:
Ummmm on the medium the awnser was 4
Yeah james is right on the multiplying fractions, we just finished that in my y8 math class
I went to a special behaviour school and foundation or lvl 2 functionional skill was the higest I could get.  As you can tell by my spelling
does this count as revision?
Gotta do the AQA higher papers, really push yourself
wtf i did that paper and mine was so hard
This looked easier than my SATS
....when I was tutoring, I was doing those first types of questions with a 6 year old
15-4 is 9 tbf
bro i woulda passed me maths if the questions were this fuck off easy
I would love to see them doing a 2020 higher maths GCSE paper - they’re so hard it’d be hilarious
foundation tier smh
15 what?  15cm No CM squared boi
I am in grade 9 and know more of these answers than George and James combined
Probably would have passed if George and James were my teachers 😂
Watching this as a grade 9 gcse student, it pains me
Watching this the morning of my maths mock as revision. Thanks Bois
*quaduhwal-lateral*
Boost this comment so they can show what score they got
It’s cm^2
have you seen how easy it is
Why is this video actually helpful to me 😭🤚
The GCSEs were so much easier in 2010, you should try a higher 2019/2018 paper.
I think you should mark it against the mark scheme
This is my revision for my GCSE Maths test rn this is what I call good work  (☞ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)☞
I literally just had a Maths GCSE paper yesterday, why do you have to give me ptsd?
them losing their mind over stem and leaf omg bruh
can i take this paper, fuck what ever pygathorus therom is
We had the exact same paper in South Africa🇿🇦
The way George says quadrilateral is so endearing
mark it next time
Foundation tier 🤢
i am doing my gcse this year and wished that the higher was this easy  also think you guys should try a level maths next
I wish foundation was still this easy :( I’m considering this as revision for my maths exam today thanks lads x
"15 what?" And then forgets to put cm^2 lol
i don’t know how u got footage of my zoom call with my tutor
legendary video, good work bossman
I'm in year 7 and was actually thinking GCSE's were deadly
Next time do higher tier paper 3 👀
Take the Gaokao and show us what  you've got boys
15% of 3000 is 450 X 10 = 4.5k per brand deal fair play to u George +2 marks
Do a higher paper next in maths
thanks for amswering all my gcse paper for me
Bro most of these questions were on my sats
if you didn't put the squared number in or what it's measured in then they wont count your answer even if it's right.
Its easy cos it's edexcel and they're cringe
james is surprisingly patient..
This comment section is making me feel bad for doing foundation maths
Roast me for going to private school but I remember doing this in year 4
:V
Should take the QCS test from Queensland in Australia.
I haven't laughed this much all week, this video is so funny
You have to do the higher tier!!
Mans out here doing grade 6 maths
the way george writes 7 makes me wanna slap him
Math hurts my brain.
Reading the comments make me feel old as I did my GCSEs 2010-2012 😅 did the higher papers though
how has this man gone to college to do a course on graphics
What in the middle school math
why am I watching two men do maths LOL
I kept saying the answers with them and was dying on the vertical angles question
No mom I can’t do the dishes I’m watching memeulous do math
I did this exam when I was 11
We just watched a man help his son with his math homework
thanks to this video i no longer feel like i will fail my gcse maths resit
Stem and leaf diagrams are the worst things to ever exist
How tf did people fail this😭😭
when george can’t do basic algebra 👁👄👁
When is this gcse usually taken? I thought gcses were supposed to be really hard but what do ik I'm American
i’m america we learn this in 6th grade lmao
when i did this i got a 5, what is the equivalent of a b so i think you can get a b but it might be diffrent now idk
Seeing math again after having finished it in school years ago is just making me frustrated because I hate math so goddamn much
where was James when I was crying at the kitchen table with my dad yelling numbers at me?
yeeees do a science one next and maybe a geography and history one too mate. i'd watch.
Pog
I got a math test this weekend and I'm sick of studying for it, why am I watching this?
1000
It’s math there’s no s or f in it !
bruh I learned this stuff in the second grade
I got halfway through this before realizing I was neglecting math by watching someone else do math?? I can’t escape it I need help
Wait till they find out you need to show workings out for full marks
gods, I wish my o levels was as easy as this
How old are you when you take these?
You should do gcse maths higher, its literal hell
I rate you do a combined science paper
Yep. This is why I majored in and now teach English Literature.  Just about all the math I truly remember off the top of my head is fuck 100% of this.
I did this kind of maths in year 5
Counting this as revision
PLEASE do more of these, this is so good
5:59 15cm squared no?, not sure, ohhh....nvm
all ur videos bang george
I failed foundation... 5 times. :D
me as an american watching this like wtf is this 5th grade shit. take the sats after this
foundation maths gang
Perfect for revision
Me:spends three years of my life stressing about my maths GCSE   The maths GCSE: hOw mAnY sHeEp aRe oN tHe fArM????
This is the kind of content I want to see
A level maths really makes you want to off yourself
watching them get the ratio wrong was so hard for me-
this was before they fucked the education system
Imagine them doing A level maths
21 is not a prime number, are you boys actually that dumb
What website was he able to draw on the exam paper on?
ok this was the exact test i took and i also remember it being a lot more difficult
PLEASE do more of these
they should try a further maths paper. it would be funny to see them squirm
I really just watched two grown men doing a maths paper
Ngl some of the stuff they said actually helped me
You need to find the 2015 Scottish higher maths exam 😂 everyone was pure raging the questions were about like crocodiles and zebras
gonna nab this idea thanks
I love the circle song and even though I know it all, I still sing the song in my head. Moral of the story, always listen to the circle song. I've always been in the top class (don't get me wrong, I'm still dumb) and I've never looked actually looked at a foundation paper, I didn't realise they were like this. My GCSEs were cancelled and I've only done 1 set of PPEs, I'm leaving soon, thank fuck.
We don’t even get choice in America what test we tak
the GeorgeM channel has fallen
Maths is not hard, teachers make it harder than it needs to be
i did a gcse maths paper last week, the 2020 one and its so much more duffucult that the 2010, thoes guys had it easy
George: James, I'm not that thick Also George: *finds the range as 9* /j
Is this real?
This is what GCSE's were like I'm 2010? It feels like a SAT paper, what the hell.
old test papers look so easy wtf
I actually really enjoyed this, try doing other countries exams too!
I'm sorry this has definitely gotten harder from when i did this paper...  rip off
I enjoy
I did GCSE maths last year and I was answering questions on cosine rule wtf
we NEED a follow-up video marking this with a mark scheme!
Can't be stealing video ideas from dropouts man, jokes anyway ahahah
Why I never explain what I watch on YouTube to my friends  Friends asking me what I watch on YouTube Me: I just watched two 22+ year old guys struggle on a math test we would have taken when we were like 10. Friends: …
The last one that they were struggling with is the easy stuff I do at school. At least I know for sure that I’ll forget everything from school in like 10 years so it won’t matter.
the range was 11 cos there was a 4😔🤦🏻‍♂️
07:13 i don't even like shreddies
this is like a test I would have taken when I was 10 or 11 in 6th grade. I am dying that they are struggling with some of the questions.
bruh i swear my year 11 math mock was harder than this-
How did I fail this
Im so confused, i cant hear the audio because my mate is blasting bones in the ocean next door, why is there a foundation tier paper on my screen?
I've got my SAT coming up and suck with ratios, percents, and fractions and somehow this video helped me understand them more......
Actually you can get a B in foundation tier, you just have to have like 80% per paper I think
Me sitting here taking two times to take my gcse maths
Was hoping you'd check your score at the end somehow
Do higher next
James looks like he's babysitting
my ex is 19 years old and still never managed to pass this exam LMAOOO
Heyyy I did foundation
hey diddle diddle the medians the middle you add and divide for the mean the mode is the one that appears the most and the range is the difference betweennnn
WHAT MARK DID YOU GET!?! WTF!?!
9:49 “oh oh your wrong george             AAAAAAAAA
More of this type of content please - all of the GCSEs George or James did
I really hope my GCSE is this easy
It's so nice seeing James help kids with their maths homework what a nice bloke ☺
tf am i doing learning about surds :[[
This gave me PTSD from when it took me 3 times to pass GCSE maths😭😭😭
I’m nearly 23 and this is embarrassing.  Do a higher paper at least? this makes the whole of the UK look like 27 / 3 is a difficult calculation for the majority of the population.  If you’re doing a foundation paper you’re trying to scrape a C maximum (or whatever numbered system you use now)
Didn't even mark it smh
you should do more gcse papers with the rest of the eboys 💀 science with al, english with will
I done my GCSE's 2 years ago... WTF this is so easy. Everyone in yr 11 in 2010 got let off!
Let’s rename the video”us watching  James may watching memeulous doing questions”
OK BUT WHAT WAS YOUR MARK??
Me studying chemistry at oxford  Also me completely unable to multiply fractions
Okay but what was your overall mark
george how have you not taken a math class since you were 15...
Having to watch this video, When u failed this paper :/
how the hell did we used to find this shit hard 😭😭😭
science
FOUNDATION - sort it fucking out
“15 what james? 15 apples?!”
15cm SQUARED
ur really runnin out of ideas here
I’m taking foundation and this feels more like a yr 4 exam rather than GCSE level
do an A-Level further maths paper
Try the higher paper its out of 80 and a pass is like 15/80
You gonna mark this?
this hurt to  watch
george i got a stella ad on this video :|
a 20 minute video damn
B u t t e r 😤😤
I had to do this sort of paper and in the mock we got the question ‘name a 20 sided shape’ and I was like wtf.
Votes for gorge to do an a level paper 😂
Lol I did an actual exam on Monday and got full marks on a higher test
i dont remember this shit being this easy
Bro wtf I’m in year 11 and doing my gcses and do higher tier, this can’t be foundation
Me whos redoing my maths GCSE in sixth form: *why can’t my test be this simple wtf*
comment
The most british video next to geoguesser pub and theme park edition
Watching this the night before my maths mock😂
maths then: MaFs  maths now: Mathematics
Defo do another one and maybe add other eboys
next up: george and jim do a level maths
This is GCSE math, I remember doing these qrestions in year 5. Not fair
For your next video could you do a higher paper?
Found my new vod to fall asleep to
this can't be an actual GCSE exam its like year 7 level
Do the recent GCSEs, grade 4 etc 😣
foundation not even higher smh
9:40 no george, no it wouldn't
this is me with my maths teacher
I love spending my evening shouting the answers of maths questions at you 😂
funny to know that this is the closest im getting to a real gcse
This video hurts my brain
Get someone to mark it
You can tell this is a foundation paper. The best you can do is a pass.
this is foundation tier one too 💀
i did higher maths all the way up til the start of year 11 i got put into foundation n the foundation paper was so easy
I'm taking Higher Maths GCSE and this is... interesting. If the difference between foundation and higher is this much I'm really glad I'm not in set 8
This is the most entertained ive been when looking at something to do with maths
All my nerve for my GCSEs have gone
i must know their score
i done  everything in this test in year 4-6 i am worried if this was your GCSE paper, now you need to do some homework and do either the 2021 SAT's or GCSE's
5:57 it’s actually cm with an indicy of 2
Loool I took this exact paper june 2010
Me on the higher teir paper seeing them struggle on my favourite style of question:👀
I’m being robbed this was how easy GCSEs was? What the fuck am I learning right now?
What This is GCSE? As in year 11 shit I'm in year 9 and we're learning about way more harder stuff than this These questions are fucking easy
want to know his score now
This video is what we all wished it would be like to do our maths homework with our dads at the dinner table
5:50 AcTuAlLy iTs CeNtImEtErS sQuArEd
Jesus christ I didn't foundation was so easy. If you get less than a C in a foundation you are bottom tier of society
Petition for George to do an A2 A level further maths paper and see what happens
the day i got my maths gcse was the happiest day of my life. Frick maffs
Good
For everyone who doesnt know, foundation is the spaka paper
They taught us a song for mode and them and I legit still know it lmao  “Mean, the average Mode, most often Range, subtract the smallest from the biggest  Median, the middle number when lined up from smallest to largest” I’ve been brain washed
Watching this knowing I have an exam tomorrow and praying I don’t forget to write fucking cm^2
9:40 shouldn't the range be 11?
2010? i swear i did this as a test paper before my gsce's in 2015 which is weird cause i did higher
I done a GCSE foundation maths paper.... cos I'm dumb as a fucking brick but I completed it in 30 minutes. All 3 of them. The bastard examiner wouldn't let me go even though I was in the "special room".         Please save me from 3 English A Levels.
Is it just me or is James face all blurry and artificial. Is will at some more deep faking shite.
This was my gcse paper bruh
Use buckets for the racio question and then share the racio into buckets  me smarter than James a gorge
You should do the higher paper next
...Jame’s quick explanation of ratio helped me more than like 5hrs of lessons on it... wtf  (I just can never remember how to do it)
isn't question 27 an estimation question?? like was it even meant to be that complicated?
James being big brain 💖
this just makes me realise how useless school is
Forgot how pathetically easy this exam was. Im in disbelief that i did this for my actual GCSEs
They got question 8 wrong. It's 15cm Squared. They forgot the squared.
holy shit that is so fucking easy
Boo boo no answers boo
its centimetre squared.
I can’t believe I did all my GCSE’s in Welsh, how did I survive
As a secondary school maths teacher this is one of the most stressful (and funniest) things I’ve ever watched haha😂
Hey diddle diddle, the medians the middle, you add and divide for the mean! the mode is the one you see the most , and the range is the difference between :) (sang to tune of cat and fiddle)
The fact that people in the lower sets than me really struggle for this blows my mind
can we see a higher paper next time
this was the year and the one i did
I literally have a math exam tomorrow, and seeing these grown men having trouble doing a year 7 paper work, I think I’m gonna pass.
This is the math test I will do
Take a higher paper
2010 gcse maths paper is literally equivalent to year 8 maths... especially foundation papers..
Someone's see their results plz
Really enjoyed this!
I am too American for this test
I'm pretty sure that's year 6 sats paper not GCSE
Every time George uploads my day is automatically 100x better
POV: You’ve come back after it was released that this was the only way that George could officially graduate
It makes me uncomfortable that he put cm but not cm squared.
WHY IS FOUNDATION SO MUCH EASIER THAN HIGHER???
They need to do a higher paper next
THIS IS WHAT A GCSE FOUNDATION PAPER LOOKED LIKE IN 2010. Mate I just finished my last maths GCSE exam today it is so much harder then that one I’m so jealous.   No wonder all the adults are telling me school is easy their GCSE paper is stuff I did in yr8
“A dyslexic and a tory do maths"
If this is what the GCSE’s are like.... I think I’m gonna be fine
Did you pass tho
I did foundation maths now I’m a medical student
why do I really want to watch James actually do those last questions...
Next step: A-Level paper 👀
Speaking as someone who actually works in a high school; that cm2 question really triggered me. I don't even think I've shouted "mode means most" so much in my life either.
Out of all the questions you found easy, you couldn’t do stem and leaf diagrams
yeahhhhh this is revision
I did this paper for my y6 sats
I’ve done that maths for practice 🙂
makes sense
The fact that they didn’t show working out so they have lost like 20 marks lol Edit: I did my GCSEs in 2019 so that’s fairly recent and even if you got the right answer with no working out you would only get 1 mark instead of like 4
GEORGE THE AMOUNT OF ADS PLS STOP
do an AQA Higher paper. It is more challenging
Banger Video
bruh the range was 11
Where's the answers?
i love GCSE math i do higher teir papers for fun
How is this a GCSE? Primary maths is harder than that 😂
They said 15cm with such confidence.
That was the most entertaining thing I've seen in such a long time
Did anyone else have a heart attack when the scene it was for 20 minutes He of asli needs a bit of dollar in his back pocket
you should try the sat
Bruh ive failed this gcse 2 times now 💀we do be on the road to passing tho..
This is the foundation paper? Wtf is this SATs. The higher paper is like 1000 times harder
“Are You Smarter than a Third Grader”  Personally I’m more of a fan of “You are Smarter than a Memeulous
It'd be fun to watch them do the HL IB math exam
Imagine Doing GCSEs. Couldn’t be me
You didn’t mark it???
Its fine, George is just built differently 🙄
How u made maths actually not completely boring? 👏🏻
if thats a gcse paper what scam paper am i doing
Did I really just watch two grown men try and complete a gcse paper for 20 minutes
hey diddle diddle the median is the middle, you add and divide for the mean. the mode is the one that happens the most and the range is the bit in between.
This is clearly the one for the special education kids
Bri'ish unus annus
I'd genuinely love for you to do more maths papers haha
POV: you walked into set 8 maths
Actual title: 2 Grown men answering simple maths questions.
I feel like I'm watching James do George's maths tuition
Omg I wish gcse were actually like this
poglins
Not me using this for revision
Me watching this as a 19yr old who failed foundation maths GCSE 3 times & still doesn’t have it: 🥲 But tbh I got 8 GCSE’s including triple science so I wasn’t that thick Thank you, goodbye.
this video was epic, but you need to tell us what you got!!!
This was like my primary school SATS 😭
What was your score?
Thick
Mark George's paper. Don't move on until we actually know how well he did.
Teamwork.
The year 3 assessment paper
I would like to formally request James’ working out at 14:52
This gave me PTSD
I wanna see a part 2 where they do a higher paper, i think that'll be interesting
Lol do an alevel maths paper next
Do the higher paper to show you are a really smart boy George
I failed my maths GCSE twice and never took it again, my college signed me onto the course but took me off when they realised it was a waste of time the second time
now make this a second channel series
Best GeorgeM vid
Wait this is Quebec Math
8:58  **insert Frère Jacques tune here** "MeaN Is AdDiNG aNd DIviDiNG, MODe iS MoST, modE Is mOst, MEDiAn In ThE miDDlE, medIaN iN tHe MIddLe, RaNGE HigH lOw rAnge hIGh LoW"
the PTSD I'm feeling right now of doing these papers in the SENCO department at school & college is unreal😅 CAN I PLEASE ERASE 2013-2017 FROM MY EXISTENCE!?😩😫😭
Take a recent higher one
i think this is a satts test
Do a higher paper
its that easy cuz its 2010's
ok this is epic
So glad we could see jimbo tutoring the children in his neighborhood
I hope to god its that easy- its so hard now and my teacher is short, Scottish, divorced  and likes to  jumps up and down when she's angry, which is very nearly every day.
i actually learned something from this
Set 8 be like
i love how james is on everyone’s second channel
This is paining me seeing how easy it is compared to the work I’m doing in year 10
Just wanted to mention that this is George’s longest vid😱
I watch YouTube so I don’t have to be reminded of school
PLEASE do the AP stats exam
This would be a good mini series to get merch out of
I’m in year 10 and what kind of easy shit is this wish I lived 10 years ago 😂😂
90% sure this was my year 6 SATS maths paper
i'm crying oh my god
I didn't have maths today so I'm counting this as my substitute lesson- thank you
Fuck me I want back to the time where this was what came in the exams...
im taking higher maths gcse papers and this is making me feel more confident in my ability lol
Not done the similar scottish version of that maths paper in 8 years! but omg you guys were hilarious!! would watch loads of those <3
This is so painfully easy
Wait I did this as a warm up test in y8 💀💀
this is my revision
Thanks for the revision tips
20 mins long fckn hell more work put into this than a main channel vid  already know it's gonna be good
today i realized that I´m actually more educated than george and I´m fucking 18
6 horse
Holy shit James taught me how to do ratios
To I swear they teach us this in year six and this is a maths SAT not GCSE
Anyone else really bugged at how George wrote cornflakes LMAOOOO
cant wait for the americans to be like YOUR EXAMS ARE SO EASY as if this isnt a foundation paper
do the higher one next from like 2019
Opposite angles are equal ❌ “Just is” ✅
Bro they doing foundation 😭
shouldve done language paper 1/2 and make george read the extracts
Please do more but check your answers after
set 8 is shitting bricks rn
Wish this was the GCSE paper we do now - so much harder now :(
U didn't mark it 😭
The range question should be 11
16:41 omg after like 5 years i've finally worked out how tf u do ratios ty james idk why my teacher makes it so complicated
But math papers now be asking you: "Jimmy is 8 years old, his train is 15 years late, calculate the mass of the sun."
Thick
👏🏻work👏🏻back👏🏻wards👏🏻   Skim through whole paper, then start at the back.
I think they are ready for the a level further maths test
I heard foundation was easy but I don't believe it was that easy.
I thought GCSES were supposed to be hard??? what is this grade 5 shit??
meant to be doing my maths homework rn but im relying on corbettmaths <3 so sick of iteration each question is so LONG to do lmao
You need to do a current gcse maths exam and see how you find that
This is a test id do in like year 7 lmao
im in year 11 doing foundation gcse and i stg they do not look like that. Are they sure this is gcse cos im dumb af and even i find this easy
I never passed any GCSE maths exam, whether it was Higher or Foundation. I got a D on average for every... single exam.. I did the exam at least 5 times and failed every single one... yes I am that bad.
He got the range one wrong too
This was nothing like gcses now. My year 4 sats tests were harder than this
If this is what my GCSES will be like the my parents might actually be proud of me
I was always pretty good at maths. Did the higher paper at GCSE, but our teacher had the higher set class sit this first as a safety net, so that no matter how bad we screwed up, we couldnt drop below a C. In a 90 minute exam, I'm fairly certain the entire room was done in less than 20 minutes. We all had to sit in silence for an hour doing nothing 😂
it is foundation tier scrubs
mark it for the next video
James: go back through that slowly George: 7x4=24 James: *no..* George: [counts up in multiple of 6] James: George: 7x4 is 26!!!  I'm in pain
Please do an A level Double maths one. Imaginary numbers would be so funny 😂😂
Please do higher 🙏
Next try the A Level maths paper
Btec will and jimbo
I don’t remember my GCSES being that fucking easy
I learnt more from this video than I did during online lessons lol
This was an actual gcse in 2010 are you taking the piss this is y6 level
Maths never seen so fun
the fact I've done this paper in yr9
The energy of this video is George is taking a practice exam and James is his exhausted tutor
This makes my a level maths class look hard
Goerge writes like me, but the worst part is.....                    I'm left handed and write like this with pencil
a 20 minute video on the george m channel? it must be our lucky day
Wow Ive spent 20 minutes watching a grown man asking another grown about questions on a foundation gcse paper.This is the meaning of life
Try a further maths paper next 🕺
mafs
Im sorry but did we really just watch George and James do a gcse with Was easier than my sats. Lol
I got an "ungraded" in maths
I wish I did this instead of working out fg(x) when f=x² and g=2x   (Answer is (2x)²)      kill me
watching this makes me feel like maybe im not bad at maths
Me who does A level maths: it's called a corrisponding angle you twats.
DO THE HIGHER TIER PLEASE
It’s 3/10 you have to cross multiply
Bruh im sitting here pretending this is alevel maths revision
As a certified 11 year old I can say this is the easiest test I’ve ever seen. It’s even easier than my year 4 test and that was just a couple of words. By the way I am bragging.
would have liked to see them mark it 👀
Love that im watching this while doing calculus lol
you should do geography for george and Jim map time
me- oooo this should be a fun video  *sees question 15*  oh i did that today and I fucking hated it :)
they should do a gcse language paper to test james' linguistic skills
Sorry for being dyslexic James, I got an 8 in English language and 9 in lit but 3 in maths. No 🧢
starting to wish i got to do the foundation paper this looks easier than my year 6 test bloody hell
I took foundation maths in 2010 and still didn't get a C. I went to university eventually..
Big brother helps little brother with his homework
people say the 2020 gcses were basically given away.... wonder what they think of this?
I swear I did this exam in Year 8
This one teacher i use to have always use to say what? 16 apples? 😂 😂
Is this really a gcse? What year is that, 6?
You should try the new GCSE specification (9-1) Maths Foundation/ Higher paper
GCSE BUSINESS STUDIES FROM 2003.. cos that’s the one I sat lol
did one of these in school today, its like yr 7 work in yr 10
Can’t believe memeulous has now done more GCSEs than I will this year
foundation
And my brother has the *audacity* to tell me not to worry about my GCSEs when his were THIS easy?!!! Good lord, take me back to 2010!
Try gcse English literature it is hell
As a student this is the easiest paper I've ever seen. I swear schools just make it harder each year. In 40 years they will be teaching quantum mechanics
are u sure this isn't a sats exam?
we were doing more complicated things in year 7, this looks like a sats paper
I can do this and that's saying something
James sounds like a patient maths teacher 😂
Hey didle diddle the medians the middle you add and decide for the mean the mode is the one that occurs the most and the djdiuwbsbsb is the difference between
George why are you doing a foundation paper come on now no wonder everyone’s saying it’s so easy do a new gcse with 1-9 grades
That’s my revision done if I fail my GCSEs it’s on you two  There in like 2 weeks :)
As a teacher, I say youuuuuuu PASS!
Why do I feel like I could sit this after doing top set maths GCSE and still fail
Hi, year 10 student here, holy shit I wish I could be doing this paper, the shite we're learning here in top set you wouldn’t believe
Higher paper maths wooh
the  fact that i’m acc doing the actual math gcse and i can’t even get half these right
I am very annoyed that they didn't mark this
Me: Mum can we get rice crispies Mum: We already have rice crispies at home The rice crispies at home: *R I C*
Should do a Biology paper from the 2018 series or something more recent to see how much they’ve changed since the 9-1 boundaries were introduced. Nah, any exam paper since the new system introduction would be a good laugh 😂
Should definitely try the higher gcse paper from the last couple of years instead
Thay should do an A-level paper
idec this was actually entertaining lol
I’m definitely gonna pass my GCSEs after watching this
Show your working out
Thanks for the revision xoxox
Litteraly did this exam as a practice before my year 11 test bruh
I left school 3 years ago and my brain has never hurt so much
Bro I could've done this when I was 10
Now i see just how dumb people who failed maths gcse in 2010 must've been - this shit is like year 7 baseline assessment material
9:40 no it’s 4-15
I can't imagine how they'd do in a higher paper
9:30 After he explains what the median is he still gets it wrong  This hurts to watch. Poor James
This. This is what should be on those posters in your maths class that say "when do you use maths out of school?". *This.*
anyone else in year 10 just trying to find some hope to pass your GCSEs?
I did higher tier last year i didn't realise that they were this simple
George we all know you can’t read you can stop pretending
I literally just did a gcse maths paper 😩 year 11 sucks ew Also this was way easier than my gcse maths paper was: its like year 6 level maths or even below
Imagine if we were taking a test this easy in 2021. People in 2010 had it easy
make this a series and try an a level paper so i can count this as my revision
is this what people do to feel younger again
I haven't done maths in 8 years 😂 I didn't want these memories to return.
your rubbing it in that im going to fail my gcse
i was screaming centimetres squared at my screen lmfao
I want to see the grade you got back from it!
9:40 15 - 4 = 9 lmao
Thank you George, I can now pass my maths GCSE
I was in set 4 maths (the lowest set in my school) but I was at the top of the class and I was always the best in the class (which I was wayyy too smug about) . I haven't done math in over a year and now I feel like a stupid little bitch baby 😂😂
Thanks for the answers
maths foundation seemed harder than this when i did it.
This really isn’t a modern one.was this one of the old ones?
Shoutout to my higher paper people who are crying
Isn’t the range 11?👀👀
how do you get to stop doing maths at 15 this is bullshit
Bruh is this for real😂 how can you not pass this?
I’m doing my GCSE’s today, and I’m doing higher in all lessons. Flipping help ne
Thats the foundation paper?! Why the hell am i doing the higher!!
how has the difficulty gone from y7 maths in this video for a gcse paper to what then would have been a level standard then as the higher gcse paper now
Now you shall feel what I felt...
the sad thing is, i have to do the higher paper in 2 days for my mocks lmao. i wanna do that paper
no but like them doing a science gcse would be SO FUN to watch
So I’m here learning about pythagoras theorem and equilibriums while they did that for GCSE
remember getting this shit when I was 11 what is this
Thanks for the revision for my maths tomorrow George
You have to do science omg that would be hillarious
why didn't you mark the paper😠
...the perimeter was 12
As someone  who  does math in university, this was painful to watch.
This is 2010 obviously its easy 😂 do a recent one
The range should be 11 not 9
This is easier than SATS lmaoo
I wish my GCSE paper was this easy 💀👄💀🖐️
The fact that this is GCSE and not SAT is wild
bruv you’re telling me I left those maths exams to see my friends who did foundation and we’d all be like “ughh that was so hard” AND THIS IS WHAT THEY’D JUST DONE
can't believe i just watched 20 minutes of two men in their 20s answering math questions for 5th graders
they need to add up how many marks they got and let us know if they passed GCSE maths
the sheer difference of foundation and higher is unbeleivable  (Edit) y tf is there some next war in my comments it’s just GCSES calm down
Why are the vast majority of YouTubers thick as shit? 😭😭
TRY A NEWER PAPER, they’re so hard now 😭
Taking a math exam for our entertainment...the things these mad lads do I'd love to see you do the Gaokao next, it's China's college entrance exam and it's one of, if not THE hardest tests you'll ever see. There IS an English section, but it's not what you'd expect
It’s pronounced tanaaaka😡😡😡😡😡
This looks like a test paper you would do in primary school and not for your GCSEs lol
they should try the higher paper next
This is Sats level
banger video jorj
Btw 15% of 300 is 45 not 450
my old mid term year 7 assessments were harder than this jesus christ
so this is the maths exam i *was* ment to do before lockdown
Math*
Year 10 this sounds like year 3
IQ 100% for sure
My grade 11 maths class and exam was advanced calculus and trig what bullshit is this
My GSCE foundation questions (one I had today) if the is a rectangle with the measurements 10,11,12cm and it has water in it what rised to the level 8cm. Where would it rise to if you put a sphere with a radius of 3.5cm in the rectangle with the water.
Brilliant video as always
These guys screwing up on a foundation GCSE'S  Me doing my GCSE'S next year on higher tier and averaging a level 4
Bruh we did this in 4th grade, 2010 was so simple 😭😭
i did that 'hard' question in about five seconds with covid ;-;
This is absolutely hilarious 😭 it makes me sad tho that I did gcse 2 years ago and didn’t know half of these questions
We dont call you thick. We call you thicc.
Imagine them teachers lol James would be amazing 😂
6:00 🤦‍♂️
Do a higher paper
me watching this after teaching this paper in revision countless times
Just wait until the calculator paper
I have written a bigggggggggeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrr 6 than that XD.
Yeah this is 100% not the current standard for GCSE maths, the amount of times maths had made me cry is so so bad
me and all my friends did higher, is this what the other class were doing?? Jesus Christ.
Verified year 4 tests
I failed mine 6 years ago 😂 couldn’t even get a level on it 😩
Me in year 11 wishing I had that paper as my assessment
I just had a maths exam today
It was 15cm²
James your supposed to be smart you went to a Tory school
Next one should be the eboys tackle the C1 A Level Maths paper aha
I'm fuming how for GCSE's I have to know pythagoras theorem and stupid sutff like that
Next time you should do a higher paper!
I saw the thumbnail and I knew that it’s gonna be gold
can not wait to watch you do more gcse practise papers when i should be revising
I remember the core maths paper being harder that 😂. But I did AQA so maybe that's it or it was just me at the time. None of it mattered now as I'm doing a STEM degree.
george said the difference of 15 and 4 was 9 hahashah
If this was the exam in 2010, what the fuck was the exam in 2000, count from 1 to 10??
this looks easier than the year six sat
Not knowing the range is 11
Is this cheating?
lol bro             lol
they should try doing a GCSE higher maths paper which is recent because i wanna see what their reaction is
I do A level maths and this hurt
I’ve got a maths exam this Friday :(
Thanks
ah yes, fifteen minus four is nine
Science physics test
as a year 10  where do i sign up to do this maths
you fucking did the simplify t one wrong both completely misread it
Quaderelateral
happy to be taking this in 2 months :)
9:40 that would be 11 george
15cm2
you shoulda marked it to get a gradeee
This is the equivalent to a transfer test
As an A-Level maths student, this makes me slam my head against a wall sm ngl
The audacity not to show the solutions...
well done mr handsome memeulous this is a very funny and entertaining video!
ITS A FUCJING FOUNDATION PAPER LMFAO
k now do my maths gcse😃🤲
This is my revision for my maths exam tomorrow
Is this what set 8 is?
“That’s the biggest 6 I’ve ever seen” - James speaking to George
Watching this is just reminding me to attend my maths lessons and I don't need that in my life
lol should have done an aqa higher paper
Do a higher paper and if you don’t get a C you do a face reveal
I’m in year 7 the start is like are fucking papers they always say ur GCSEs are really hard like I’ll just pull out your vis
Showed this too my maths teacher... Who's dumb now Miss?
In modern grade styles it's a level 1 2 3 4 5 then the rest of the grades (6 to 9) you have to do the higher paper for
pls pls do the higher paper and a gcse additional maths paper
Please do a higher level paper
I know you love maths and listened to math themed music, but it's not for me. Enjoy guys, I'll check back in on the next one!
this just felt like a shit maths lesson hahahah
Why did i just watched a 20 minute video of 2 men doing maths
Did u revise Yes Where's your source George and James do gcse maths
I’m American, how old was he when he did this?
The difference between private and free education demonstrated in one video.
goddd the 2010 papers are easy compared to the shit we're getting now like what the actual fuck is a polynomial
really enjoying this
Not me being nervous about my gcses lol.
This is genuinely interesting and engaging to watch. Esp as a 21yo engineering student
please do a higher paper from 2018
As someone who does math in university, this was painful to watch.
nah this the typa shit you did in year 7 😂
good way to trick jim into helping with your online classes
20k likes and you have to do the higher maths paper :)
They should try a higher gcse maths paper next or a level
DO A SCIENCE ONE NEXT
I recommend the Hey Diddle Diddle song if you are struggling with mean median mode and range. Its like the circle song, very catchy!
*I could do this now and I’m in year 6*
i did this paper as a test exam for gcses in year 7 and got 100% lmao
When your parents try to help you with your maths homework 18:25
i did these in year 11 and still didn’t pass sobs i’m dumb
I went to school in Germany, and if any of these questions were put infront of a 7th grader there, they would be laughing their ass off. How is this a GCSE paper in the UK?
This should be on the main channel
5:49 NO GEORGE, IT'S 15CM SQUARED. WITH THE LITTLE 2 ON THE M
kinda sad u didn't go through the mark scheme tbh
I just lost sympathy for my mate who failed this paper
I physically recoiled when they didn’t know what a stem and leaf diagram was
I have a fucking maths test tomorrow and listening to this makes me feel much better about it.
higher tier next please
Why is this more educational than my actual GCSE Math lessons?
This is the best revision for tests on YouTube
Do we have to wait until August to get the results?
I was also really bad at maths in school and they always refused to let me do the foundation paper because it was ‘easier to fail’ so I always was forced to do the higher paper and I still never passed... the jump from foundation to higher is mad
this gives me "dad quizzing his kid at the dinner table" vibes
i dont remember Maths Foundation being this stupid... mine was way harder... why couldn't i have this paper
I have my gcses next year,I'm not good at maths but this would be easy lol
5:44 when george cant workout area   and puts 15cm not 15 cm squared
as an A-level further maths student this pains me to watch
Lol loved this
Only 2mins in but yeah I was the same with the first questions thinking how stupid of them it was to move me to foundation weeks before the exams & I still only managed to barely scrape a 4 so....😀  Edit: finished it, don’t think I’d even manage a 4 if I had to take this again now
You can see the pain in james' eyes
more
for a man who complained at the start james sure is enjoying going through and working out every single question
Higher's first question was the same as foundation last question, george would of killed himself
im so glad i never have to do one of these again !
DO THE HIGHER PAPER IF YOU'RE REALLY ABOUT IT
This is a SATs paper🙂
i got an and for ‘how to ace GCSES’ LMAO
Do the higher next
9:37 Uhm... the range is 11, not 9. 15 - 4 is 11.
It’s so easy because its from 2010 🥴
Me watching this video when I’m taking this exam next week 👁👄👁
can James be my maths tutor please
foundation maths in england is so much easier than in ireland wth💀
17:38 I’m actually quite concerned if someone finds that hard
Why did I learn more from this video than from online learning
wait so we don't get the answers?
Yo George Morgz quit YouTube legit this time
bruh this crap easy compared to now
I just spent 20 minutes watching 2 grown men do a gcse paper    And it was great
I’m doing further maths alevel and I’m watching this
My school can't even do normal GCSEs... 😭  Behaviour schools don't get given enough We don't have enough resources so we aren't able to get anything higher then a c bc my school doesn't have to funds to teach us. So basically this is now my way of cheating thank u.
tell me why they made me do this paper in the first month of year 7 and i got 20 marks
holy shit i never realised how little you remember from maths class lol
ah yes my revision
As someone who’s always done higher maths, I now feel incredibly smart ✋
i miss when maths was this simple i don't understand pre-calculus
Not even going to mark it smh
George. I don't think 15 - 4 is 9.
We didn't get the answers??   You should've marked the papers at the end 😂😂
These dummies are the only people who can make maths funny- (unless your answer is 69 or 420 ofc)
Fun Fact: people failed this maths test...
WE LOVE MATHS
What year would this be for? I'm from New Zealand and this is ridiculously easy.
These guys are so sh*t.
this is making me dread exams:) the fact i havent done any work in lockdown is scary, but not scary enough to make me do work:)
there is a reason that this was given to all the BTEC foundation kids... you just had a bunch of special people sitting in silence looking at graphs and counting on their fingers. Then they all reach the final few pages where algebra is involved and all start screaming at the sight of the letter X
pls make this a series they’re actually very helpful lol<3
I’d recommend foundation biology if you’re doing science
I'm sorry but my maths foundation was not this easy man and I'm in Wales
This unironically helped me with my maths homework
Ayo thanks mate, needed the help in my maths paper :)
Jeezus these r braindead mugs
homie my 7 year old sister does these questions
Me watching a fuckign university educated man forget how to write out probability: 👮‍♂️
We did this in like year 5 in England, this is not a GCSE Exam.
Mum: What are u watching, you are supposed to revise for your maths test tommorrow?  Me: ... 👁👄👁
Had my moxks yesterday and fuck me it was so hard half the shit was like find a area of a trampezom with a circle in it then how much atea is left
Here is a circle, it knows how to get around
Big brain george
Watching this video is so painful but funny
7:50 That is a sad failure.
Nah how am I going to get one question wrong in class and get told I’ll fail the exam and these two twats have got over 75% of the marks
I literally did my non-calculator higher paper 1 today lmao
I have maths mocks tomorrow and this is my revision
As a Edexcel IGCSE Maths student I am proud of these mighty men teaching us the ways of survival
we gonna ignore the fact that they got the perimeter wrong
That is like the literal one I did for mocks
what did you get?
Thank you to the teacher that gave me a pass because I never actually did the GCSE’s thanks to Covid.
Are they allowed calculators in Englands’s maths exams? In Ireland we are
nahhhh im 22 and having flashbacks
👁👄👁
this easy as fuck im not doing my exams tho hold that
Just did my higher paper a week ago.
this makes me feel better about my maths
Haha, this is the easiest paper I've ever seen!!! Lol!!
Lads this is year 6 SATS
As someone who does foundation paper all I got to say I wish they were this easy
I feel attacked, I did my gcse foundation maths 10 years ago and still failed 😂😂 but when I went to uni few years ago, I had to do a-level equivalent maths and ended up getting a first?! wtf
Absolutely wheezing at 2:46
to be fair it’s a lot harder when you’re under pressure
You guys should try a present day GCSE higher paper :')
Thank god to covid, I managed to pass all my GCSE'S without doing any exam!
This makes me feel like Einstein. This genuinely makes me ask if they know who pythagoras is.
I wanna see the Eboys try the 2020 higher paper especially since we dodged that last year
how many did you get?
should've done the higher i have my gcse statistics paper on Friday
James big brain
this makes me feel a lot less nervous about my GCSE’s lmao
Bro the shit im doing in year nine is way harder than this
Why is James trying to act smart in this video  Getting these questions right isn't a flex
Genuinely think they accidentally did an SAT
James is just a disappointed parent
This brings back horrid memories of doing Maths yonks ago in school. Like deng :''''D
please do a higher tier paper to really show off ur big brains
I came home from a day of double maths to come home and see this (Genuinely sick video tho loved it)
James is like that one teacher that if you ask for help on a question they stay and help you with all of them  The best types of teachers tbh
A lot of that is shit I was doing in Year 7 tests 💀
doing higher maths gcse and this pained me to watch
We didn’t even get to do our gcse exams :( rip class of 2020
2010 + foundation damn last thing I saw that was that easy was Georges mum
watching two grown men struggle with basic arithmetic whilst attempting to do a maths homework on fucking integration by parts made me lose a lot of brain cells ngl
I literally remember doing this as a practice paper last year im getting flashbacks
George: “Rice Krispies- RK.” Me: “Reality Kings.” James: “R Kelly!” Me: 👁👄👁
*James: I have big maths brain*  *George: Ah yes, Mafs*
this is going to be good
q u a d e r i l a t e r a l
Is this George's answer to a Bob Ross Breakdown?
This is so shit, even for a second channel vid
Wow this is easier than Nat 5
Earlier than the kids tryna bless my whole family
insulting my maths skills😞
george was definitely a set eight kid
This was easier than my year 6 sats 🥺😂
This is actually pretty cool
Can't believe I've just sat and watched big man George do a test, this brought back some bad memories 😂😂
9:39 does he not see the 4... they were clowning on it but damn
"why does everyone call me thick" don't worry they're not calling you "thick" they're calling you "thicc"
Wish they marked it to see if they passed or not
You not gonna mark it...
Im in sixth grade and we have tests harder then this. And two 20+ year old men are struggling with it.
Are we sure this is GCSE and not functional skills?
do higher level next hahah
Surprisingly entertaining
he do be out here teaching maths lol
2 22 year olds cannot do math at fucking all: the video
People in 2010 really out here doing Year 8 level exams for GCSE
Please do a physics exam lmao
As a maths teacher, I can confirm that this was painful to watch.
thats a year 6 sats test George
For the confused Americans: a GCSEs is the test at the end of secondary school, and foundation is the easier tier, with the highest grade possible being a 4 (pass grade)
do a 2020 higher maths mock
epic
This is something I would take in Y6
Why don’t you try A level maths... it’s awful 😣
wait i genually think this was the exact paper my teacher gave at yr 7
Stop it I'm getting flashbacks 😭😩
I was hoping George and James would go through the mark scheme to see if they passed or not😂
You choose a right time for me to procrastinate studying for my leaving cert ✨
As an A Level maths student, this was painful to watch 😭
I'm counting this video as GCSE revision
I’m going GCSE rn and I’m shocked this is what a pass is I was worried I would fail 😂😂😂
Ngl I def did these for my SATs
There is no way this is an actual GCSE thing
We need a link to the test
this video has made me way less stressed about my gcses
I got a 4 by 2 marks on higer whilst I was in second set, why tf was I in second set
As a fast track a level maths student this is painful to watch
Mate you realise all the ads ya gonna get in your vids now will be about school very epic
I did that paper and failed the first time so had to retake it. Lol
This is maths that I did when I was 12 years old-
Ah, this is where we use the stuff we learn in school irl, on YouTube video math tests.
as a year 11, we have one test paper to do as homework a week 👍🏻
I had a maths test today and I thought I did bad.  I think differently now
Try doing a higher paper that is more recent than 2010.... You will truffle a bit more
Give us your result at least
Physics next :D
Bruh. This is math? I kinda blacked out all of my exams lmao.   Ps I took a technical theatre course so no math for me lmao.
Why does this paper look like something I would have done in year 7-
Who else got a Stella ad?
The way he said quadrilateral 😭😭
Jimbo mazza got the big brain
As someone who didn’t actually take their GCSEs you should try the higher paper to show what I missed out on
im doing a-level maths... i should not be watching this, right?
Is this really the paper that the foundation kids got to do? 😭 bro, the question really be what’s 2+2
Learnt more from this video than I ever have in school. I don't know if that's sad or cool
I wanna see em do the higher maths paper lmao
Me, 16 and currently taking pre calc lookin at this like 😃
I’m watching this video instead of doing school work but this is school work so I meannnn      We’ll ignore the fact that I’m 19 and the work that I’m ignoring is for environmental studies lmaoo
I love this
They should do a higher paper and they might struggle
seven w a v y goats on the farm
Petition to do a higher paper
Dude i'm in year 9 and this is painfully easy
By watching this video i can tell James must've done the higher paper
George is going to get Twitter cancelled for the “3 genders” joke...
I used to tutor gcse maths to 7-11 yr olds and this is not unlike that experience tbh
9:40 wait how is the range of smallest to biggest (15 & 4) equal to 9?... Looks like it should be 11 to me but who knows right
i hate it here i stg its not this easy
AYO WE WANNA SEE IF YOU GOT IT RIGHT,  SHOW THE ANSWERS
Literally not looked at a maths paper since 2008
STEM AND LEAF DIAGRAM nah that unlocked some memory in my brain fr
9:39 MY BRAIN
Do a CIE IGCSE maths exam next!!
14:36 why can he do the harder one😭
this video gives me hope for me gcse’s 😭😭😭
alternate title 'James tutors a braindead commentary youtuber'
I learnt more in this video than I leant in maths class 👁👄👁
Could be a main channel tbh
you know he ran out of ideas when he does math for a video
The stupid part is that it's actually or was actually depending on how the tests have changed since 2012 easier to get a C on a higher paper than a Foundation paper even if you were thick because most higher papers questionswerethe same as lowers to an extent usually changing after totaling enough points to for a C, this is how I managed to sleep thought all my tests  and pass 36points was a sweet C!
I feel sorry for James
Nah the higher paper is a different breed lmaoo
If you do a gcse science next time mark it too please using the mark scheme
This hurts my head so much
This feels like a year 7 maths lesson
The only reason George is beating the test is because of james
Having done a maths paper today, this video was needed.
This is so shit its funny
The scream at 9:53
I’m not gonna lie I think my intelligence level peaked at gcse maths
I swear i took this test in Year 2 SATS
I couldn't be arsed with my maths mocks so I failed them all and they put me on foundation for the real thing 😂 didn't even end up doing it cause of covid so I came out with a 5 even though I did no classwork so idk where they got that from 😂
Is the only reason for a* gcses to flex
You're not a true Brit if you didn't say  "Hey diddle diddle  The median's the middle You add then divide for the mean The mode is the one that you see the most  and the range is the difference between"  To yourself in your maths tests
you should have put obama over your shoulder stareing directly in to your soul instead of having half the retirement home doing it and walking up and down with squeaky shoes
Why the frick is George's skin so white
Funny how a 13 year old is taller than george
year 7 work lad
george really thought the invigilator marks the papers
im literally watching this whilst doing a past paper usadfcaeihfcaihfc guys my mocks r next weeek
trust me year 9 maths is worse did you manage to find the special school paper
What the fuck how are foundation papers this easy like i did this shit in year 4
wanna know another great maths song hey diddle diddle the medians the middle you add and divide from the mean mode is the one that you see the most and the range is the difference between
George, just make a "Mr. Memeulous Teachings" channel
YES
Thank you for giving me the answers for my test
This has given me more confidence for my maths gcse I'm at least getting a 5
If there’s a question on circles we all know George will get full marks
Oh yes the range is 9 😂
Something I don’t have to do cause they are cancelled 😳
i failed this exam so hard
Is a D or and E a fail in the UK? Where I'm from a E is a pass, C is a decent grade and A is literally nothing wrong
I hate that I just woke up to see this after getting back from having to do like 46 of these at school Edit: I just looked up and forgot I have another one as homework 😃
how is that GCSE work
its like when you finish a mock and the teacher has to go through the paper with the class
this looks like a year 6 sats paper lmaoo
alternate title: two idiots answer maths questions
*Difference between 4 and 15 being 11 exists*  George: “That’ll be nine”
10:20 like you could just do 24/100 😅
My average maths test is harder than this  I'm in year 8
6:44 “I’m gonna take take a shot in the dark” 😂😭
why has maths gotten so harder in 10 years ☹️
me and george do maths the same way lol we choose the fucking hardest way to do it and don’t even consider any other ways at all
lol i think the GCSE's are a lot harder now, thats from like 11 years ago
Did u say GCSE this is like year 6 homework
Memories 🥲
God the higher paper is cancerous in comparison to this. This video literally triggered me because of how easy it is for the lower sets
Man my year 3 entrance exam was harder
That test is too easy and I’m doing my tests know
Me watching two 20+ year olds forget the squared after cm: 👁👄👁
they should've done a higher instead of a foundation paper
U guys should do an american english paper
james looks like he’s being held hostage
the board I am late stupit fool
They need to try a Further Maths paper...
I have my biology gcse exam tomorrow morning. send help
Thats a foundation paper? And you get a c, damn in Wales a foundation only goes up to D
Median is the middle, you add and divide for the mean. Mode is the one that appears the most and the range is the difference between.
Ah yes, 15-4= 9
Well this is fitting, it's GCSE season for me rn 🙂😭
foundation is literally so easy 😭😭😭😭 shouldve done the higher paper omg
Jeez! GCSEs are easy as fuck. I wish I was British.
9:41 is defiantly not 9
See this paper looks alright the over c paper was such a big jump from this difficulty wise it’s outrageous
alright, here we go. Got a grade 9 in higher maths for GCSE last year and haven't looked at anything maths related since. Let's do this.
james being a parent for 20minutes
how did he get the range one wrong😭😭
There is no way this is for fucking GCSE'S 🤣
as a student abt to do GCSE Higher Maths Im seriously considering foundation rn
Do a higher paper next, wanna see you suffer
7th of June is my birthday.... ILLUMINATINCONFIRMED
Do higher bro
I was actually hoping for some good GCSE MATHS techniques, but my Hope's died at the start of Q1. Come on James, wheres that grammar school knowledge?
Is this the set 8 paper?
Hey i was just arching a old boys vid so I click as fast as i could
they missed the opportunity to tag this as educational and get those extra views smh
I’ll never know how I would have done in my maths gsce 😔     What a shame 😏
James isn’t familiar with non-private school exams
why is this entertaining? its a couple of grown men struggling over a gcse paper but i cant stop watching.
This looks like a test I would take in Year 4 not for GCSEs
I literally just took my maths mock today. I now hate maths
Good luck to those who are counting this as revision for their GCSEs
Please do a higher maths paper as a part 2
As if u did a foundation paper those are piss easy
Bro this is what the foundation GCSEs are like wtf they’re so different
I have my maths mock tomorrow I’m pretty sure this counts as revision, right?
what about an a level maths paper 😁
Is it just me or does James have Chicken pox ;-;
brilliant video as always George thank you
How in the hell is George so damn smart? 😳😳
This didn't prove that they were smart, its proved that they aren't stupid
I feel like Einstein watching these two
can u replie pzl
George is worse than me and I'm in Year 8
I had a maths test today
This is all I gotta do for a grade 5? Jees dis is easy
This is like my year 2 sats
I'm supposed to be doing the higher tier this year but no GCSE
I watched this while doing gcse maths
Foundation:how many fingers am I holding up (8)  Higher (36x +root 9 x root 8)36x               95y  Y+ x =  (2)
We need a series of them trying all the GCSE papers
foundation tier lol
its 15 centimetres squared
How dense do the fucking tories think we are?
Thank you now I won’t fail my GCSEs
No more maps, only maths
This is the exact paper we do in gcse's at my school. Guess who's gonna memorise the answers?
I love u George memelous
Funi George and James smort lol
I just want a pass on all my papers, and I'm in "higher set" maths and I just wanna move down man. We get numbers now and if I get a 4 or 5 I honest to god don't care if it means  ✨a pass✨
*big brain*
the 5 dislikes are there maths teachers
potato
Bonjour le homied
I feel like I’m being scammed by watching this video
George your mums gay,  pin this or annoying orange will get covid-19
when you enter set 8 maths
they should do a higher paper. that would be a real challenge
brain damage in a video - sun tzu
I just realised, is Memeulous WillNE?
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh fuckk sake man
This is wayyy easier than the foundation mock exam I had to take 😡, which I am now going to fail school bc of
And this is supposed to be a math exam for 16 year olds ?

All I’m asking for is forgiveness.  I’ve been cancelled for so long, I can’t even go out for a morning jog or coffee anymore.  Please, I’m begging you to accept my many public apologies & un-cancel me for good.

He's not doing AQA Weak.

im too early
Hello
realisation that i have to do this in 2 years 😭
Big brain
Bro, I never did my GCSE😂
Out of all the e-boys, you know James is the one that chose art as a GCSE, George chose PE, Will chose some shit humanities class, and Alex was just the special one that played uno all day with the teachers
LMAOO
Oh no I stayed home to stay away from this
Did you use a calculator
WEYYYY GCSE EXAMS!
Shout me out or I’ll bomb your house mate

Pov: if someone says “pov: your not early your on time” im going to put a hole in my wall
