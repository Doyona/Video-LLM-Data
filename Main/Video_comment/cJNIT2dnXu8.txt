Amazing build and video sb737 and also "WorshipTheEditors"

i admire how you haven't restarted on your hardcore world like so many others but did you get this project idea from cookie god he built something similar not a month ago
hey @sb737 you should install both litematica and malilib which are both 1.19.2 fabric AND give you custom blueprints and ones from tutorials

I really dig the new stuff.  I think as far ideas about the video.  I like that the editors have a presence in the video but I think that sustained messaged that I can read in a glimpse becomes a distraction.  Quick flashes of the messages would be impactful.

Hey SB , saw that community post and wanted just to say my opinion, i like you trying new stuff , but id rather wait for the video and make it more organised ,bc im tired of hearing "i have no time" all the time  , new builds are really fun , but you give them no purpose your world has a major disconnection in itself , we know nothing where stuff is and ive been here since the start, maybe its time for a new start , take it slower like one new ep every two weeks and try new stuff in between , plus you are dependened on the trends so maybe do some "only *biome* " worlds once in a while to switch it up , i love you trying to build lately love it from you looks really nice , and maybe try imolementing some cliff hengers in the episodes , do bigger projects so people keep waiting for the end , the 100 days should be a title not the whole purpoise and rule of your world
stop going over time SB it is not helpful to the editors

Amazing build SB! You are so creative with all your farms and builds

Your videos were super cool
Hi I saw that you were asking for advice about what types of videos we want to see and I like the hardcore series but get more viewers you could space them out a bit to give more time for collaborations and other new ideas or experiments with other videos, while also giving you more time to stay healthy because I think I can speak for everyone when I say we dont want more content if it means you have to push yourself past your limit thanks for the vids there awesome!

love the editors!
I watched every episode of this series within a week or something pretty close to that back at 4200 days but I think that not too many people want to commit to that long of a task to get caught up. Maybe you could change your title style to mention the day at the end and have to project of the episode more the focus of the title so that anyone who hasn’t watched the whole series is more likely to click on an episode. Just a thought and I’m not a YouTuber so I don’t know if it’s even good advice.

hey SB, I'm loving the shorter 25-30 minute videos rather than the 1-hour videos. Also, I love the fact that you don't tell what you are going to do in the intros (I used to skip it) because it makes the watcher more hooked (maybe it's just me) but overall I feel like this video layout changes a lot (props to your editor for putting a lot of effort into editing these videos), Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope you continue with this layout bc I'm loving it. Quick Question: Can u make a second channel where you upload the uncut footage of all of the hard-core series days? (probs not possible as it takes a lot of disk space)  ps: Can you put subtitles? i know it will take more time but we don't mind if it comes out a week later

I can’t believe he went from a simple guy playing on the Xbox version of Minecraft building simple square houses and now builds giant red stone machines, farms, and does crazy challenges like 500 red stone in a hour!

just as a little tipp: for people who are new to the channel and watch this as their first video it would better to say exactly what you are going to do in the video i think. like do a little list with the big goals or something like that. anyway amazing work and i really respect you for putting so much work and dedication in your videos. you actually deserve more than 10 million <3 :))
This was so entertaining to watch and the final result satisfying. Love your effort on this hardcore world SB

Hey sb have loved watching your videos, I have been watching since about 1600 days, and I know your having trouble with your views, I genuinely love the series for what it is, my only advice is not to start and finish a big build or an adventure in 1 episode, hint at a new one before the 100 days is up as a good clif hanger is always good fun waiting till next weekend for what it could become, I know you have loads of ideas packed away in your head somehow, my creativity would have ended after 2000 days 🤣 but otherwise I think your series is great dude and hope things build up for you

I really enjoyed the way that SB used to edit his hardcore videos. Days 1000 - around 2000 were some of my favorite ones. I think now it is too much and too fast paced and would enjoy to see him go back to the old style of video.
To be honest, your old thumbnails look so much better

First off, a super epic video but when you get over the time everything feels very hectic and stressful and you don't have time to detail your builds, I don't know if it's just me. Maybe you don't set any fixed days, but simply build your project or spread it over several episodes. But maybe that's not possible either, I don't know how you work with the editor. But i really love your vids. keep on the good Work :)

SB you better build a momentum to you editors
Commenting at day 5118- the speed of the talking and action is making me hella anxious. I much prefer the more normal pace of editing from the longer vids (45 min+) Edit: came back around 5196 to say that I would love to see these more complex builds. Even if that means only 1/3 of the build is done in 100 days. It feels like the 100 days format is really limiting you at this point

its crazy how he can make anything look intense 💀
Great episode, but where did the lore go? After you said you forgot it at 5000 days you dropped it completely, and I want to know what happened.

I like more how you done 2000-3000 your videos, but how you do it now are good to. And pls do longer videos, it's more time with you. I love your videos and have watchde every video on bed wars and hardcore. :)
I liked the older editing more than the new one (throughout the whole video). But also, I don't know why the editors feel obligated to continuously write comments after SB goes overtime, it distracts a lot. I feel less connected to SB and more to the editor writing comments (and actually quite nonsense comments to be honest, in my opinion) - them doing that at the end of the video makes me stay with that thought of diconnection (between the viewer and the main character) even after the video and makes me less satisfied, loosing my interest.

fun fact: in 5:33 music in the background from the roblox sonic speed simulator
i got to say, the editing is great in your videos
How do you make so much videos in such a short time?!😅
You should stream the next 100 days, I'm bits, and then upload the video, you would get more views

I was here for all the titles: I Transformed the MINESHAFT in Minecraft Hardcore (5200 Days), I Transformed the OCEAN in Minecraft Hardcore (or something like that), and last but not least: I Survived 5,200 Days in HARDCORE Minecraft...
Didn’t anyone notice transform was spelt wrong at the start 😅
Amazing video SB! KEEP IT UP!!! Dont worry 'bout views going down, they will eventually come back, अत्युत्तम!
he lost all his extra hearts while gaining tnt
another tip, instead of using stone or cobblestone to place sand just use string which u can get from your EOL farm.. it will make your work much easier

Amazing Build SB! Btw, you can add a small well in the desert section as it will look perfect! A small tree would also look pretty nice. Amazing video!
I honestly thought you made 2 videos in 1 day but I did read your post and I still like your content but I think that Minecraft or at least hardcore and 100 days is slowing down I used to see at least 20 new videos of 100 days a day now I see like 5 but I still enjoy it

I got a very simple challenge, consider it to be last.   Just build pyramid, the base is 100×100, full netherite.  Can you do it?
I love ❤️ how all his hearts ❤️ just went out in this video lol 😂 🔥
Do you actually have ocd or are you just saying that? It’s makes me not want to watch you, it’s hard not to assume you’re being like every other YouTuber and using ocd as an adjective and not actually having it. Just by the way, no harm if you didn’t know it was wrong!
Hey sb...  I have an amazing idea .. you should do a live stream of next 50 days or next 100 days in just a single stream ... And after the stream you can just upload its video also...
2:00 u missed diamonds
it reminds be of that video that @acookiegod did
I miss the old style of editing of sb

I love the new editing it’s too good . Your editor is just the best
You are a nice person to watch for comfort, I’m easy to make sad in some situations, so when my computer that can barely load up it’s lock screen tells me I can’t even begin to try to stream content for simple games such as FNAF, I cry silently for a bit, yes, physical tears fell down my face. I just got told by a dumb computer that I have such a horrible computer, that I can’t even do the simplest of things. People telling me “just do This, or just do That.” But everything they tell me to do requires better cpu, I started a stream, loaded up a fnaf 4, and it peaked my cpu so much that it just quit. Thanks HP, for nothings. I may be 18, but when I had that taken from me, I cried like a two year old inside that just got a toy broken. Why is anything good so hard to have, like a room for just myself, I just want privacy. An average computer, that can do at least something.. I hope some people see this, you may not relate in the slightest, but this is my venting to the SB737 comment section. Sorry if I am an annoying dumb person TwT 😓

Hey SB and editors! This series has gone on so long and become so incredible, I have a suggestion - it might be easier for new viewers to hook on to the series if it had some sort of intro highlighting what you've accomplished so far, explaining all the cool OP stuff you've already done :D
SB you are doing a good job on what you are doing so continue to entertain us , you are the reason why I started playing hardcore mode, again love the series

WORSHIP THE EDITORSSS
I left a suggestion on the community post but another suggestion maybe turn the hardcore series into project based ones into 100 days . Will save you the headache of HAVING to complete 100 days each week and thats format most people use . Say for the infinite hearts video . If it was a 20 min video based just on the project with chill editing it would have had greater retention

I'm good! Had a long day at work but this is a nice way to unwind! I'm enjoying the video, but I spent a good third of it wondering if SB had built something like this before or of I was just confusing him with hordes of other mcyt'ers lol! I have been drinking water, I have thought "W editor" many times this video but fi you really want me to WorshipTheEditors then I will!
good editing editors
Why did u change the titel. i saw is was i transfomt the ocean ..... but anyway hii
Next video: I made a statue of myself wearing netherrite armour
is a shame the editors whoever they are, are saying worship them (even if is a joke), i was really enjoying the channel, anyway thanks for the content but i'm not longer watching the videos beacuse of my believes, bye.
dude that editing is insane

We can all confirm the editors are going crazy
Umm... SB? Why don't you just use your wither skeleton farm for coal?
No, don’t worship the editors. I will only worship Jesus Christ himself. Plus y’all don’t even have any power. You’re weak. You can only edit footage you were sent. There are thousands, 10,000s, all the way to millions, of vids out there, that your editing skills are useless on because you can’t access them. Why would I worship powerless beings? Yes I know you can record the footage, but that’s not the original. Anybody can do that. So does that mean we are all powerful? To  your logic yes. However, to my logic, we are all equal in value to one another and that everybody is not a god

Dear SB , I read ur community post and I am genuinely concern about u.The issue might just be that you are thinking about your old audience only which is already built.. so just try focusing on getting newer and younger  audience.They like fun more than the huge build. And also pls take care your self. Love your content ❤

I am also looking forward to some of the older series revisited, like friend or foe season 2,  Minecraft but's or even SB Sunday's!!! But no matter what you do I will support you and I'm sure a lot of people will too, so take some rest and take care of yourself.  10 million let's gooo!!    (the hearts went out so fast lol)

A not too long, creative, entertaining SB video. These are my fav!

It’s crazy how being restrained to 100 days per episodes forces you to think ou side the box to make things happen faster. Those water draining machine are genius I assume it’s your own design since you didn’t say who it was from. Very impressive!
Btw you don't need a full beacon to insta mine terracotta just one layer of 9 blocks will do

I find it funny that his extra hearts disappear as fast as they came. Sb puts loads of effort into making this. It makes the series unique.
I think there’s to much editing

SB I like your videos and the your content but I think you should try doing the episodes not only 100 days and ignore the days because its seems like you are in a rush to complete the project and not doing it like you wanted and if you do just one project every episodes and give it your best it will be way more fun to watch. 😊

Hi
worshiptheeditors
I can see why the new editing style might appeal to some, but I preferred the old style where you talked through everything you did, and explained how it all worked. However I can see that the new sleeker editing style appeals to more people as it is faster paced and nicer to look at
Bros starting their villain arc
WorshipTheEditors
Hello editors, I’m not doing good, got in a crash today, but chose this video to help my calm down
I've seen many of these type of things, mostly it's transforming an End portal, but in my opinion, you did the best! You made it blend perfectly together and added biomes worthy of that detail. I've seen people do amethyst biomes (Come on, really?), but thankfully you didn't! Anyways great project, loving your videos!
nice level
WorshiptheEditors
Ok as funny as it was please cut down on the editor stuff because It just completely took my attention off the video
Sb lost all of his hearts in the first three minutes of the video
bro where is the dead bushes the cactus andbn i cant stress this engough wells and small pyramids  cmon thats peak lazyness   it feels sad to not see it but it still stunning  edit: wait there are dead bushes

WORSHIP THE EDITORS(FOR DEZ)  And all fellow editors of course
on day 5197, I wondered if he would go into overtime again, and then saw that there were 7 minutes left on the video which confirmed my suspicions.
How do his extra hearts back (referring to when he need sponges and fought some elder guardians) did he do the golden apple glitch again or did he reload his game or does his hearts regenerate (most unlikely) or something
WorshipTheEdditors fr fr
Why did you change title to not say 5200 days?
Workshiptheedditors
Really takes away from the video having annoying messages from someone who thinks there have power over their employer
WorshipTheEditors, you should bring him into the server.
Has nobody realised how he runned out of hearts in less than 30 days-
I miss the 1 hour videos
You should make the entrance to the cave in the snow section powdered snow, so you can't see it from the outside and have to walk through. I think that would be really neat. : )
I love that we got a little bit more sand simulator just like in the ocean monument

Oh and also worship the editors
SB737 i got a cool idea for a new video in the series.  You can find an end portal and make an enormous hole around it and use a giant chain type thing to kinda hold the end portal up. I did it in my own world and i think you can do it!
the editors must be having a fun time talking to everyone watching the video when SB goes over time but you've just gotta worship the editors
Pls never stop making these vids, it’s amazing

No offense to SB, but whose build is this  cuz i've been watching for years and don't get me wrong, his builds have improved a lot, but terraforming was never really his strong suit... so its kind of hard to believe that he's able to build this all of a sudden and so quickly as well, he would have to design this thing as well, whilst he's doing 100 days every week? im sorry but thats just not happening, is it
Bro, in next episode (5300 days) transform a lava lake in the nether into an ocean monument for example
Love your videos! Been watching since the hardcore challenges. Much love <3

The whole reason I have watched SB for years is that he didn't go and follow the same gameplay style and editing style of all the other big YouTubers, all Hardcore Minecraft videos on YouTube nowadays are "I Transformed _____ in Hardcore Minecraft" followed by a fast paced montage of placing blocks and I loved SB because he didn't fall into this same style of playing and his videos were unique. SB, if you see this, please don't fall into this same gameplay as all the other YouTubers.

You could put a orb in the middle with the biomes coming out of it and chains supporting it from the top as an idea. Good vid again

Been going into dangerous territory for a while now to keep to a format. I doubt many people would be disappointed that a build isn’t finished in one video, but instead a lot of these videos are overlapping on days now. Whilst it’s funny to see the editors comments towards the end of the videos, it would only be polite to take a minute to voice your gratitude towards them. It would be a shame to see the quality of the channel go down, and hopefully reacting to your earlier videos will help you reflect on where you have come from and what made this series engaging in the first place

I feel like this type of thing has been built by a lot of content creators it is genuinely really cool but I would like to see some thing more original like the mega build at the sawn chunks or the end portal room Also sb has stepped up his game in building so I think it would be good for him to some thing really nice and original so show the whole of yt what he can do
We all know SB will go overtime.

It's kinda sad how he used like half of his notch apples he took so long over to get, for golden hearts that go away pretty quick of small fall damage and flying into things with an elytra.  I love your videos sb <3

I feel like it would be better if hardcore episodes were not 100 days type episodes but rather regular episodes featuring a project that has been done in said episode, just so that there wouldn't be going overtime
No one wants to worship editers dodo
worshiptheeditors
Honestly when he goes into overtime I usually just pay attention to the editors talking and not really the video lol
rip his golden hearts
For the algorithm and editors
Nvm that but where did all ur gold hearts go
WorshipTheEditors!
I think he goes overtime i am at the 2st minute of the video
It’s so sad seeing sb losing all of his absorption hearts lol
# worship the editors and and sb you do great work
When you don’t even know what biome he is on because your too busy reading the editor comments.
Wooooow
WorshipTheEditors
So I had to watch the last 10 days twice.... The first time I was just reading what the editors where saying 🤣 epic build! WORSHIPTHEEDITORS

WORSHIP.THE.EDITORS  p.s: editors if you see this maybe next time he goes over time you prank him in the video. For example you could cut out the sound or something else.
All that I say is the opposite: 10-3=6 I have a billion dollars sb is the worst builder
He lost all the hearts ¼ into the video 💀
apparently he is going to 'transfrom' it
Worship the editors ;)
I love how he made himself immortal last episode and then loses the extra hearts in 2 mins
I’ve been a fan since the first 100 days videos and he has progressed so far and I can’t wait to see what he does next
Do worship the editors.
Maybe it would be cool to make a mini version of your world
I thought the only way you could die is the void, but at this point, with infinite hearts, I don't see you dying at all. Keep up the great content!    btw WorhsipTheEditors

Whenever the editors start putting text on the screen, I stop paying attention to the actual video.
WorshipTheEditors :)
Worship those editors. Give em a pay raise

how did you use all your gold hearts?
sb goes overtime its alright but his editor just randomly starting to add his own thoughts is a bit irritating because, if someone is watching a minecraft video , so it be . i am not here to chat with the editor i guess . tbh i liked it at first when it started but soon it got boring . and it even keeps the new viewers away as they are just reading those captions and behind that sb is just continuing his commentary , kind of changing the focus . i am a subscriber and i am just getting lost as soon as the captions kicks in . ItS NOT a hate comment , just commenting what it is . take a look at it and do something about it . best wishes .
Longer videos PLEASE
RIP the extra hearts
WorshipTheEditors!
Quick design idea use  camp fires at the bottom of water falls to get a tumbling effect
Does SB know he lost all his hearts?!

This is my favourite build in this series lol Amazing work! Your building skills are getting so amazing

if he didnt go for the 500 redstone he would've done the build in time
You are so good I've grown up with you most my child hood (I'm Ten)

Hi Sb737 loving the vid keep up the fantastic work!   Ps don't die in the hard-core wold! Love the series😍
You should bring the editors into your world and have them do something (like build some thing or destroy some thing or do a troll or whatever). Or at least while we’re on the topic add special guests like lazar beam or some other YouTuber. That would be cool.
When he could have dried the sponge in the nether: 😂
He casually just has 100s of hearts
What happens to his hearts
Worship the editors :D

Why do the editors want us to say "WorshipTheEditors" (also I said it for u editors)
Worshiptheeditors

Why is no one talking about how he lost all of the bonus hearts that he spend the entire last video to get in like 2 minutes

Can you stop all the comments on the top left at the end of the videos, it'd so annoying when your trying to watch the video
I am doing this just because of editors power: Workship the editors. Ok can i go now before you restart all of sb737s days please?
Where did all of sbs hearts go tho?
Worship the editors
is no one going to mention that it says transfrom right at the beginning. just like minceraft. probably just a typo tho.
Thx sb737 and the editors for the content👍👍👍😀😀

WORSHIP THE EDITORS   also can we see Fred soon love your videos
my favorite thing about him going overtime is his editor’s comments 😭
Sb you should put cactus in the dessert section and dead Buches. Also put some dead Buches in the Sava section. The plains section will look better if you put different kinds of flowers,treas with and with out beehives.The Luch section needs Axelotes in the puddles.Replace the coal ore with Gold ore and Quarts rore in the Nether section. Thank you for reading my suggestions. Love your videos

I've enjoyed the video I've drunk a lot of water

Personally, I don't like the new editing style. I prefered the. hour long, in depth videos without the action music.
I understand why you do not want to duplicate sand, sb, but i think you should allow yourself to use tnt duplicators for farms. The developers have declared it will not be fixed, so why not use it?

I think this is longest overtime that sb has gone
While I do appreciate the editors' hard work overtime, I do think they're overdoing it a little bit with the quips every scene...it's fun but it gets a bit distracting.
Only real SB fans know the real title of the video.
Why are the episodes so short now can you mack them longer

is it just me or does 1:05 to 1:09 sound so satisfiying

Dude your extra hearts are going down throughout the video because i think the game is realizing it's glitched
The editors commentaries are the best part of the video.
You need an end base.
It’s only a matter of time until Sb says “netherite is for peasants “!
You should transform the end itself next episode
I think the minecart tracks could have tunnels on either ends, as well as buffer stops for those that end abruptly. Great build!
WorshipTheEditors  They are the best bit of the video
no more Amazing World lore?
at the start it says 'transfrom', is that a typo or is it intentional?
Worship the editors!
I wish I had the same hardcore world
Notice by day 24 all his notch apple health is gone
Hey sb love your vids and am a long time fan. An idea for one episode is to make yourself a mega base because no offense but your current base is very basic. It’s obvious you can build since you Teraformed this and it was amazing. I HAVE FAITH SB737! I HAVE FAITH!

You should go back to the old thumbails, they were better for a serie that count days...

Worship the editors!
Loving the new format! Good to see he’s keeping up with the times
@SB727 if you need coal go to the wither skull farm and you have a lot there i think
WorshipTheEditors
For the structure of the track you should try adding triangles and more support beams just to make it more realistic

One thing you could Do is finish destroying the bedrock above your nether base. And fill up at least one chest of every item in your storage room.

Wow...just wow... I’m loving all of this content and I’m LOVING SB!!! Your vids just keep getting better and better every video and I’m enjoy this content every minute!!!  Let’s just appreciate all the effort SB puts into this, I know that he is a special person and he cares a lot about his fans!   Keep up the great work SB!!!!
the editing is sweet
Were did all your hearts go
I want SB737 and sandiction to start a duo hardcore series
SB who do you think will win the world cup?
Ur my favorite ytt
when you become a god in Minecraft :
00:02 Transform not transfrom xD
You should do your infinite hearts thing when your afking so you are doing 2 things at once
wither skeleton farm for the coal??????
I love u so much sb
Rip to unlimited hurts
Amazing video
All his harts 😭
Worship editors
Nice
Hi God are you doing ok.
I dunno how I feel about this new SB. If you look back at his older videos, like 200 or 300 days, it was way less gimmicky in the editing, I dunno if it is just me but yeah, i liked SB because he wasn’t like every single other hardcore yter.
why you take totem if you have a lot of hearts 😂😂😂
Get all of the advancements in Minecraft Hardcore!!!!!
OMG DID NOT EXPECT THIS VID, AMAZING!!!
I would love to see SB join hermitcraft 😁
You said clay instead of concrete also all the ‘immortal’ hearts that you have to stay immortal are all gone :)
Amazing the videos been out for only about 12 mins and already has 10,000 views and 2000 likes!
his hearts thoooo
Why did you call terracotta and concrete clay ??
Sb u have great content I love your vids
Thank you so much but sb can you mayby make you hardcore video a littel bit slower pleas also I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS
Love the vids but it’s way to fast paced but sb the videos are amazing
Congrats to everyone early
Me, has a bad day SB737, uploads Me, 😀
Go back to the long vids
earlyyy
it says "TransFROM" not transform  apart from this love the vid and your content keep it up
Make a video where fully fill all your storage Love from India
@SB737 I tried the hearts thing in both orders notch gap to gap. Gap to notch gap and it didn't work then again I am on bedrock edition if that has to do anything with it pls respond and help
The time you spent on making these videos is just unbelievable. Respect
You have a whither skeleton farm

When ever it’s Saturday it’s the best actual day of my life cuz of sb he’s the best yt and his content literally has to make him at like 48844883mil subs and he should be on the top 3 most subbed he’s the best and so much love and respect as how much time he spends on this series and vids and I hope u get to 4 mil this year lookin tight but I think u can do it c’mon
This was quick
I literally going to be mad if people think SB737 used more time to collect all that redstone
WorshipTheEditors
5 year olds he said hes tired of drowning (there brains) HE MUST HAVE DIED
11:02 The wither skeleton farm???
Ok
its funny to see him losing hearts after every cut
Hello

I'm concerned about your editors. It seems they want to take over the world...
lore lore lore lore lore lore lore, i want LORE
Watching this makes me feel even worse about my own minecraft worlds.
Can you please bring back the longer videos 🥺
Don't die

Where did your heart go❤
Believe or not SB editing quantity improving day by day
how match xp did your cactus farm make in all that time
I don't love the new way that the edit is done, it's not original at all and it's like all the others youtubers. We passed from a 40m/1h vid to 25m-30m condensed we see absolutely nothing.
Best videos ever
God plis fogivmi SB737/God 0:59
you should try to collect all types of tropical fish
Simply a minecraft god
I have a good idea what if you tried to make a statue of the newest mob that just was released in Minecraft as one of your new builds to come
You are amazing.
Who here want SB to start to live stream part of this series?
469 comments after 8 minuts
Yay another SB video!!!  I always look forward to what I'm gonna start calling SB Saturdays!
I was here before 1mill!

First to comment
I’ve never been this early but I’m excited
I love his dedication to this series he literally can’t be stopped
"WorshipTheEditors"
from the thumbnail I thought it was someone else😂
I'm sorry sb, but I'm not sure if your videos are getting better. I remember back in the old days of your awesome world, Friend or foe, and countless other series, it felt like watching a friend rather than watching a youtuber. Your videos now are still amazing but they don't have the original charm. I know you are trying to get 10000000 subscribers, but don't let down your old subscribers. Your thumbnails are looking like a lot more of the cringy "I survived 100 days as a grass block" thumbnails, even though your videos are good, I just think that we have lost our friend SB737, and we have a new, youtuber SB737
Hi there I'm from Morocco i love you chanel
Love these glad you're continuing it
sb you sould get a texture pack or data pack that removes the extra hearts and says above the normal heart how many extra hearts you have
Sb737 could you build a custom moon with all sorts of custom biomes? Love the videos
Video too short
453 comments in 5 mins. Dang.
Insane video!
5 mins late
You’re amazing, keep it up! :)
YOU MISSED SOME DIAMOND
cool
It's sad to see his hearts decrease throught the video, so much work.  Love your vids tho
Ocean draining speedrun
0:44 Here's a tip to save time; Place Wet Sponges in the nether and then mine them up, trust me, it will save you loads of coal and time for other things.
Can you change to the old Video  type
Watching his hearts go down makes me cry
hello sb737 this was a good vid good job!
Reminds me of acookiegods video
I thought you didn't like doing glitches why did you get infinite hearts
Yo
There is a typo in the start . it says transfrom instead of transform
R.I.P that bat 2:17
you make the best videos ever thanks for making them
Pog
Let’s all take a moment to appreciate how much effort SB puts into his videos for us.
nice
We can all think that Sb Never dies on his world.
Crazy to see how fast he went through all the absorption hearts
my prediction is that the series will end at 10,000 days
I wonder what it's like to be pinned.
Seb to idouar
It would be an honor to get pinned by sb
5min gang
I love you sb keep up the good work ✌️
you should make a new world bro, you're so OP on this world dk if its fun anymore
I love this cutting style
You never realize how many hearts sb uses until you see his extra hearts go away
2100 days , make perfect armour . 3100 days . mega base at spawn . 4100 days . added lore 5100 became imortal
Sb did u watch Luke the notable 3000 days
I just realize it’s a long time no one killed a Guardian fish that’s what I called them.
Op sb
Sb737 is so cool he can build super cool I can't even make a stachu
Editors you do a great job!
I think SB should go up to level 12345, just for the memes
I Love This Series
I’ve never seen this before
it took me 4 minutes
Best hardcore youtuber back again
SB op
hi SB i dont know if this is the case but sometime ago you did a stream and watched that acookiegod video is this a bit based of that video?
Hi!
He never fails to entertain us
He lost all his hearts!?
Sb737, I see that you are really trying to make every video count and also to put in as much content as it can fit in the +100 days in to your world, so I have a idea, if you can do 5400 days in hardcore Minecraft. So that would mean that you would do instead 100 days 200 days, so you can do so much more things and more time😁
21 seconds ago this got uploaded
I love sb his videos are so insane
I was wondering about the late upload. But it doesn’t matter. It’s his choice when he wants to upload it and I respect that. At least the vid i and many others wait for the whole week is here and I’m gonna enjoy it!
I’m saying it now. The editors are absolutely GOATED for this video. And SB, Great Minecraft video as always! I always admire the hard work into these hardcore series videos.
Sb plz can u mention me
This is the first comment
