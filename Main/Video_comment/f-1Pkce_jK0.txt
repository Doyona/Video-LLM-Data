This video was so much fun! Which date would you have gone on? 👀
I like Lexi Rivera
Aaron you should have brought your wallet so you guys could cheat and hav more money than ten dollars 💵
this was fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Crazy That I Fine A YouTuber Have Same Theme Song His Name A Wolf In VR  He Havw same theme song  at 10:00  and Who watching this in 2025?
Roni and Aaron are the perfect couple to still have fun on a date with only $10 😂💛
switch to be fair
Where did you get all that money
Yes you should do another one of these
13:01 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂
plssss dooooo a part 2 pls pls
Roni is such a sweetheart !! I would love to see them swap the date in 2025 !!
I find it crazy how John made the popular song make u mine that we have all heard
...john's outfit looked like it matched what Roni and Aaron were wearing, but probably cost more than I make in a month. I don't get fashion 😂
Tbh I liked the Ron Ron date more cuz like money can’t buy happiness but overall they both had fun that’s what matters but still I like the 10 dollar date
I loved roni's date more hahaha
Iiiiiii lllllllooooooookkkkkkeeeee
I love seeing you guys pray on camera, btw Roni, the Lord enjoys any prayer 🙏 ❤
John is way too nonchalant
“ It’s a fashion cement” that was so funny u guys nail it
I know I’m late but I would like to see a switch video
14:49 cuz it’s the color of money got me dying on the floor
Vanessa, what happened to Petunia the stylus?😂😂😂😂😂😂
Nessa your so mean
Aaron : giddy up😂
Boogers
I like green, that’s because  It’s the colour of money 😭😂
2024 anyone?
SWITCH AND HAVE PART 2
IT'S  HARD TO BELIEVE 99 CENT STORE IS GONE NOW.
LMAOOOOOOOO John saying cause it's the color of money and Nessa laughing is the highlight
VENNESSAAAA AN JOHNN WHAT RESTRAUNT DID U GUYS GO TO FOR DINNER THAT FOOD LOOKS SO GOOOD
This was a movie
OMG ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Who is this Jon guy? Where did he come from?
APHRODITE (Greek goddess of love and  beauty)
I love that Vanessa has a side part and Veronica has a middle part! I feel it makes a huge difference in people. I have seen teens have middle part but when they do side part they look older.
in the beginning Vanessa and Veronica said they saw Lexi Rivera do this and that is all I am thinking about while watching and at 14:51 I thought for a second that Vanessa was Pierson!  Not Veronica breaking the chalk holder, just how?! And both their facial expressions!😅 17:10
What is that band aid on Aaron's nose for? Its funny I am here chuckling at how he twitched his face and the left side of the band aid slip off itself and (they cut & edited it out) magically appeared back down 7:15
Money 🤑 doesn't buy happiness
16:14 Priceless smile.
john calling nesa a roman greek goddess is so sweet and romantic
1000 not 10,000
Yes yes switch
Saw the swap video and I have to say Ronnie and Aaron killed the $10 date and the $10000 date!
You could plan a $50 date for each other. It would be so much fun!
The 10 dollar was more Fun!!! 😂😂😂😂😂
i was watching back at this video my school literally pops ups at 10:22
You should make a movie out of this……..I can see it now”Vanessa and John drive away in there sports car 🚙 and Roni and Aaron are there…in thrift store funny clothes”Vanessa says “see you later” Roni and Aaron stare in aw”😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
VANESSA HAD THE BETTER DATE
Is no one gonna mention the fact that they had 10,000 freaking dollars???? If I were those 2, I would’ve put that into savings! Like, something doesn’t add up??!!
roi i feel like i pick roi   SHE WIS i litterly feel bad
18:19 😂
18:20 😂
18:08 😂😂❤❤ Johns face 😂 Nessa and John said “ok” at the same time
18:07 😂❤
17:56 Aaron crawling and Roni drawing ❤😂
17:57   Roni: “V + A = VA”              Aaron: “I thought we were RonRon though” 😂❤
17:51 aww ☺️ this is so sweet! I love Roni’s “Yay!” at the end ❤
16:05 aww ☺️ ❤ Nessa’s smile at the end 💖 16:14
1:33 I think the  $10,000’s is in the #2 envelope!
I love Ron Ron's date it was so hilarious they actually made me laugh 🤣10 dollars date was the best ❤
Bro will smith was in my most favourite movie focus
“We saw will smith” 😂
I want someone to look at me the way John looks at Nessa
Yees switch 😂
I had so much fun watching this video. It gives lesson to me actually. Having $10,000 would def. gave you a lot of privileges while doing it with your partner and that's make it special.  While having $10 would make you realize how simple things will make you happy (with the perfect partner who's not seeing money as happinesses).

I think that Nessa and John are like a boujee , money buys happiness couple and Roni and Aaron are like a cheap, money doesn’t buy happiness couple..
I just watched Roni and Aron's 10,000 date and it's cute both Nessa and Roni ordered the tuna tartar
I’ve been to the place you and John went to
aaron says: i have a question for you, Jose goes and i got an answer lol i luv that part
15:03 Aaron: “bye ✋🏼😢”
11:37  roni: “Ahuh ur welcome, you see that” that’s where I died 😭
Roni is cindrella, she married a commoner and her evil sister took the prince mwahahahah  14:58
HA HA HA
I love both dates they both look like they had fun but I'd prefer roni and Aron's date it looks fun 😊
Aww that was cute both dates, aww and I like seeing Roni praying for their food 😊 the contrast between Ronron in their outfits standing there while Nessa and John go with their Porsche was so funny 😂 I’m going to watch the video where it’s the other way around now. 😅 God bless you guys
Dear beautiful Vanessa have tell you something promises to you to helpful to me and here with you and someday and wonderfully and ask you something like you and will be my mummy yes and no say to you all and hopefully it will be very thankfully for you so
The outfits for Nessa and John were ❤. Roni and Aaron...😂the dress!!!
So funny!! 😂😂
I love the john but the fact he said “ okay “ like 10 times in the space of a minute is so funny. Don’t worry john I do the same with “ like “ 😂😂
Needs had a really cool date but roni was very humble too!❤️
Can we just appreciate the way John looks at Nessa 💗
14:48 "It's cause it's the color of money" 💀
I would love to see the dates swapped :)
John looks like he could be a pilot. He should take some flying lessons
Part 2🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
One day you guys should swap guys Vanessa will have Aaron and Ronnie will have John
I love their hair and style❤
I like roni and Aarons date!! Less money more fun 😁
I can appreciate the $10,000 date but, the $10 date looked slightly more fun. Nessa's was amazing, she went on a helicopter, she had fancy dinner, but Roni's was more enjoyable and like she said, she made the most of what she had and that is important. Nessa looks incredible in that green dress btw, wow💕💕
The truth is if you’re with the right person it shouldn’t matter how much money you spend on a date. Obviously having more money to spend allows for more expensive experiences and food which can be very enjoyable but just staying at home relaxing with the right person can be just as enjoyable
Don't switch don't switch I don't think you should
Is been a year i am still kinda of curious to see what Nessa would do with $10
When going with your gut goes wrong but also right in a way😅
Honestly I liked to is date more because it's true love like nessa is too but like roni was more down to earth and proved you don't need money to have a good time ♥️
V+A = VA 😂😂
When John a nessa left to dinner it was hilarious😂
10
And u guys should of said yes tot he movie
Sry but I think Vanessa is the prettier twin but Veronica is cool
i’d love a part 2! this video made me laugh so much
What’s with all the Nessa and John hate in the comments?
Johns reactions r really bad sorry
Money doesn't  bye you happiness ok Vanessa and John
❤Celia
.
I hate verónicas  and aron  date  I love Vanesa and John  date more then  roni  and aron date
Nessas evil laugh is everything😂
2:41
2:31
she wohd of chosen a bettr men then jone
Aron’s fashion statement though! Like, Yas Aron!
Guys, you should do a video where Tiger stars in a one man show! 😮
where is vanessa’s green dress from???
It's so nice to see aron and roni happy and having fun with each other.
felt so bad for Aaron 😭
This might be one of my favorite videos! I was cracking up so much! Paul, your editing on this was spot on! 😂🙌🏻 Loved it!
When the clothes were only $2 it was like they WON THE LOTTERY!!! Amazing :)
i think ronron did better
I would Normally want the 10,000 but the 10 bucks looks More fun
johns excitment at 18:09 when they both said okay at the same time is so cute!
I love how in min 17, Aaron said our but then he said mine, now that I review the videos I realize how I didn't pay attention to the small details. I love the couple so much
why did roni and Aaron’s date seem so much more fun?
the fact they went on the little kids ride made me laugh it's so funny with ur love one its always about the person the money don't matter as long you with them having a good time no matter what it is ... it's always enough
did they actually meet Will Smith or was it a little joke 😄 i would've took the opportunity to be in the movie be the next amazing professional actor out here like hit me up
LOL  Ronnie and Aron just watching them drive away LOL
“We don’t need 10,000 dollars to have fun” that was so cute. Ron I and Aaron are such a sweet duo. Also great vid! You both looked like you had so much fun!
Did anyone realise the water bottle on the back of the car. If they drove off the people behind would get splashed with water.
Bruh shes hyping it up so much and her bf didn’t even seem grateful 🫣😂
I don’t like the new boyfriend lmao
when aaron got out of the dressing room I was like what’s wrong with it? then I realized 😭😂
Nessa and John cheated on the $10 date cause they used things that was at home
I love how Vanessa talk about her date calmly and Ronnie still gets jealous 😂😂😂
Why don’t Nessa and John kiss
Yes!! Do a part two we’re you guys switch! I love that idea love you guys to❤️
Aaron 's date is the worst
I have new found respect for Aaron and Veronica. I see why they are married. Good team. But the sound of the engine of the Porsche though.  👌 Although I wouldn't go for one. (Not a big fan of flat 6 cylinder engines)
Absolutely!
Honestly I would've had a great date with $10 but having a date with $10,000 would be nice.
When nessa said  I wanna take John on a nice date 😂1:03
This my first time here and I really like the homour and enthusiasm which you put into this video, however the man and girl who were getting a date with only 10 dolars, it's a demonstration that it's possible to get a date without a lot of money and at the same time, get a fun and enjoy day! Thank you for making us smile.
OK so nessa and josh Green dracing is amaizing
So jealous of John and Nessa's first part of their date I've always wanted to fly in a helicopter even though I hate heights
The cashier form the thrift store is so nice
17:12 is hilarious
im not gonna lie I think that the 10$ date was better just cos it seems so fun and cute!
''10,000'' holds up only 1k come on do better stop with the clickbait
Ronis face when she broke the chalk thing
When John and Nessa drove away and Roni and Aaron were just standing there 😂
You guys are so cute
I feel like Vanessa and john deserved that wonderful date
In 9:28 I heard sirens and I thought that that was coming from my house but then I realized it was coming from the video💀💀
Please switch I loved this video once again please do it again
The look of Aron’s face when he opened the jello
i prefer the 10 dollars, it looks so fun
Why does Nessa  look like Brent reveras ex!
i still can’t believe nessa is dating John Vaughn from PUBLIC
Money doesn’t by happiness
Message does not deserve john
Ron I gets 10,000 dollar date
I love Vanessa’s new hair it’s so cute
V+a =va
How did you get a Porsh for 10 dollars lol
What happened to Aaron’s nose?
Make a part two
Roni and Aaron are the finest example of dorky couples are the best couples I mean look how cute they are 13:27
Yeah your day was definitely the best😃😂
11:35 Roni so adorable
What I would give for them to kiss their date ❤️
Love how chill John always is
Fun fact in Hong Kong there is 1000 dollars bills!!
I like aron mor then jhon
I wonder how much money Nessa spent... with that helicopter ride... 😱
Yes switch..
I just love Nessa's dress it was amazing but Roni and Aaron date was cute
Okay okay but can we talk about this dress NESSA wore 😍😍😍😍😍😍
I feel like nessa looks alot like Pierson
I love how John is so chill about everything.
I like the $10 one
Jose is elite❤ world please bless him
Roni: WE DON'T NEED $10,000 TO HAVE FUN!!!!!
John: Because it's the color of MONEY Nessa: ok BYE GUYS Aaron: i like our date Roni: I think the people in the comments will agree Me: Nessa's date is way better
Not gonna lie, a nice pricey night out is a great, but there's something very fun about cheap silly dates.
One Million dollar date and One trillion dollar date  so you can both have a amazing time
honestly, i wouldve piced roni and aarons date.
btw John and nessa that reasturnt looks preety empty theres just two people behind u
i feel like roni and aaron had the cutest day and nessa and John had the coolest date
vannesa im your biggest fans
Where do you find guys like that? boring, stale, dumb, awkward, lame humor. I mean is there anything cool about them lol
Why did you repeat the intro? What are we doing?
I would Veronicas
Effortlessly funny and adorable❤️❤️ I’d say the $10 date is fun and wholesome
Would be a fun time if the boys did a hangout with ten$ and the girls did a girl day with 10,000$ then switch
I've been a fan since 3 years and I'm answering this question *who is the cuter twin* I probably think venessa is the cuter twin sorry veronica
Yes
I came back to this after Nessa's 10$  date. Roni &Aron , you guys are goals, the most wholesome 10$ date ever ❤
José is a cool dude!! Hate that John barely makes reactions!!
Jesus loves you
Aaron and roni are happies geniun fancy person date thats the real true love than jhon and vanessa
i would take 10 dollars anytime because 10 dollars is 500 pesos in Philippines and i would be happy with just a 20 pesos date
Even though roni and Aaron have little money they had lot of fun
OMG JOHN AND NESSA LOOKED SO GOOD WHEN THEY WENT TO DINNER!!!!!!
Roni: lets disinfect ourselves  Me: hahahaha Aaron: YOU SPRAYED MY ARMMM
May the lord bless You Roni, Aaron, Nessa and John. The lord loves You.
Honestly these both seem really fun, I'd gladly do either one.
I think nessa was having a really fancy date..
I hope they removed the water bottle from the back of the porche
The video was slowly loding
When Nessie said beautiful dinner I totally thought she was about to say delicious view 😂
7:48 I love this energy roni is giving
Jose a real one
Aaron's outfit made my laugh so hard. I love Ronron!!!
I like the 10$date
Man I loved Jose’s attitude and demeanor, seems like a great dude
New sub bc of this video 😘  Love the energy of both dates but Ron 💘 Ron had me laughing 😂
1:40 to 1:45 nessa is so cute
Does Roni know about will smith
Roni did such a good job!!
Okay I love John & Nessa’s date. He was so happy 😀
I still liked the RonRon date
14:57 is the funniest thing ever. The way ronron were standing there and watching them 🤣
I'm watching this now, in 2022 and the fact that ronron didn't even confirm their relationship when this video was released.
Did anyone else notice the little teeny tiny Tabasco on John’s oyster tray ?! So small & cute I can’t even handle it lol
The fact that Roni & Aaron really wore those outfits out in public… legends. Also, I replayed the part where their little chalk contraption broke like 5 times lmao
Roni’s outfit reminds me of Carol😭
Yay! Thanks Jose for saving the budget!
buy nessa a dress for the date.
I seen the other one and it’s awesome and this one is too I love y’all so much I can’t
What jose did was rlly nice I hope he didn't get in trouble for giving them a discount
Do you know they are married right 👍?
“V plus A equals VA”
Jose is so nice
John is so nice I love that he’s apart of that family now 🥰
okay but why did i randomly out of all your videos today pick this one, and than today when im watching this you guys just released the switched version, trippyyyyy.
Honestly the 10 dollar date seems more fun then the 10,000 dollar date but idk lol
V + A = *VA* 🙌🏻
You should definitely switch the money amount and do this video againnn!
15:05 roni and aaron waving hands to vanessa and his boyfriend with fancy clothes and porsche OMG hahahahahahahaa that was really funnyyyyy
Coming back after 4months because I definitely want to see that reversed date thing now that roni and Aaron are married
Lexi rivera😂😂
Aarron at Roni are funny and cute couple 😍😂
Omg srry roni lol poor roni):
“Wow”
I feel like aaron & roni had more fun even though they only had $10!!
So where part two 🤔
The $1,000 dollar bill doesn't exist anymore.
hi my name is Lilly and i love your videos
The $10 date was awesome.
When Nessa told Jhon about the helicopter he just said: nice 😁
We need reverse edition
Okay but thrift store was that? Lol
14:51 Nessa’s evil laugh 🤣🤣
Honestly the $10 date is what I would do. They had so much fun! The expensive date is nice, and cool and I would still love to do it but I feel like the $10 date meant more.
Johns reactions: 😐😐😐😂 ( just as a joke)
I think Roni and Aaron’s Date was better ngl💀
did no one notice that when aaron was in the thrift  store that one side of his bandaid popped off hahaha
need a part 2 to switch the money amount!!!!!
part 2!!
a date is not about money its about spending quality time with each other, but anyways its your life idc
You should make a funny movie that is cooled fonnyist
Can you please do part 2 🥺
Roni looks like Donnalyn Bartolome.
the $10 date looked like so much fun 🤣😂
You guys should do a part two! Love you guys! You are both so beautiful! ❤️
Nessa & John look like a super rich married couple and roni & aaron look like their kids😂
Yessss we need it switched too
Ok but like the way John looks at nessa and Aaron looks at roni is things books are written on
I loved Nessa’s and John’s date it was so beautiful and her dress omg I’m obsessed ❤️❤️
Is so funny now that ronron is married
This video was better than Lexi's... I think it's because it feels more serious and planned out? :)
14:35 THE DIFFERENCE OF THE OUTFITS
Yes!!! Switch and roni and aaron get 10000 but draw randomly again just to see what fate would of had...
missed an opp to say no way Jose lol 😂
Imagine what would happen if Aaron or John said no
i will always carry $100.00 just in case.
I can’t stop laughing at Aron’s dress 😭😭
Why is John so chill
Can we plz get the part 2  But places reversed....
Aaron looks like a little girl when you were eating the Jello and when he was in that dress! :)
Go back to Jose and get a lot of stuff from the thrift store
the wey they were stending when ness got into the porsche
NAHH CAUSE WHEN RONI BROKE THE CHALK HOLDER THING PLSSS THAT HAD ME ROLLING 😭
So funny Roni and Nassa
*it’s the cost of money* don’t let it get to ur head Jon
Hahahaha ronron's outfit is so funny
Who else thinks that Roni would look really cute with just below the shoulder length hair?!?!?
Jose was a real one right here 😂
Aaron: I think you have to open the chock container Roni: *Breaks is* Later~  Roni: R plus a is Raa Aaron: But I thought we were ron ron
This is so funny XD
I love Roni and Aaron's relationship <3 <3
15:00 plzz roni and aron look like kids saying bye to theyre parents 😭
We can all agree that RonRon is living the life of a kid
12:29 I love how she immediately started to pray and thank God for her food 😭❤
tbh i feel like roni had more fun than vennes
I had my seniors valentines day brunch thingy at the odyssey <3
We bed a part 2
I’d prefer the 10 dollar date. It feels so special to do something simple yet beautiful and fun
It would've been so funny if while we're seeing Aaron and Ronis's date, you could see an helicopter passing by.
I think you guys should do that
i like aaron and roni's date because it so much fun
This is soo sad 😂
Aaron and roni are so cute💖💖
The carousel got me 🤣
Aaron: "I Like Green" Roni: "You Guys Look Great"  John: "It's Cause It's The Color of Money" lmao
Yes switch the roles that would be super fun to see too omg 😍
I loved Roni and Aaron’s date, it was so wholesome🥺
Roni And Aarons date was the best bec the love was in their heart instead of the money
RONI AND AARON SHOULD HAVE THE 1,0000! tHEY ARE ThE BEST COUPLE
Roni And Aaron are the cutest thing
No wayyyy! I've been to the Odyssey a couple times before!
honestly it looked like Aaron and Roni had more fun 😂 i couldnt stop laughing when Aaron stepped out of that curtain at the Thrift store!
12:12 LMAO why was she sitting like that?
Gotta do another vid where Ronron gets the $10,000 date  and Nessa & John get the $10 date
i literallyyyyyyy just said you two should switch and make another video 🥰🥰😂
2022: 493
Roni: wanan go on a date? Aron: um sure… IS THIS A PRANK???
Nessas date tho
YESSS I WANT TO SEE THE SWITCH OF RONRON GETTING THE 10,000 DOLLARS
This is fked they twins and have like the same taste in guys I seen thumb nail that other guy looks like a white Arron they into the tall guys with long faces lol
Ron Ron
john is the most lowercase person i have ever met
this shows that aaron and nessa can be happy without money
Low key, I would rather go on roni and aaran’s date.
17:09 LOLOLOL
10,000$ is what I am going to save for 8 months to buy my new car .. can not relate at all ;(
We need the part 2🤧
Do a part 2 switched!!!
i am also a fan of lexi rivera and ofc t you guys
Yes please second video
o
lol the dress Aaron had to ware is so funny
They should try this again but switch amounts. I'm curious to see what Nessa would do on a $10 date.
Now Since They Did A Success Y’all Should Do A Redo Video With Roni Nd Aaron Having A 10,000$ Date Nd Nessa 10$ Date Lol.
the odessy?? more like the od-no-see!
Switch! I would have loved to know how much Vanessa ended up spending.
We need a part 2 ❤️
yes do it
omg john is so funny hahaha
Idk but John doesn’t seem energetic or excited just gives me weird vibes
When Roni broke the chalk holder 😂 I cackled!
I think Ron Ron team won
This hit different now that Ron Ron is married
John is a man of a few words but when he says something it’s interesting and funny
hi
I love your channel
I feel like there outfits are like life before marriage and kids and life after Marriage
Won't lie this was a funny video...and Vanessa looks drop dead gorgeous 😍
Yes to the swap in cash
A reverse of who gets the money would be fun but what I would love to see is the editors cut where Ronron got to hold hands and stuff just like Nessa and Jonh did 👀👀
But Ron Ron was pretty funny
My favourite was JESSA John and nessa
I thought that dude was their dad. Nessa bf looks old for him. Then again she looks like she’s 11.
Roni and Aaron’s date def!!!
“I wanna take Aaron out on a nice date, I think he deserves a nice date” DAYS AFTER THE PROPOSAL 🔥😭
Roni and aaron are the cutest there so weird but cute and i love how thete  comfortable with atother
I think both kinds of dates are sometimes needed in relationships. This was a lot of fun to watch! I think you should do a part two where you switch.
Yesssss swap roles pleaseeeeeee
I love this video lollll it’s so funny
what happened to Christen???
Aaron: I have some questions for you. Jose: I've got an answers  Jose is the paid actor. ✨
i don’t know why but john just seems so detached. i don’t know if he’s camera shy or something but the vibes are off about him 😕
Hi
Poor Roni 😢😂💛
Pls do the part 2 pls pls pls pls pls pls pls pls pls pls pls 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😢😢😭😭😭😭
Roni and Aaron made that so much more than I thought with ten bucks. I was thinking “oh maybe they’ll pick up McDonald’s and drive to a nice view and watch the sunset idk
SWITCHHHHH
Roni is John and Nessa’s child while Aaron is the neighbor’s kid (who happens to be married to Roni)
14:51 nessa why did u laugh so mean i cant stop laughing!!!!!!!
17:00 I don't get why people were like "please confirm" they really didn't have to announce it, like ever.
You guys should do a re do and switch it'd be fun
the fact that roni and aaron were able to a lot with just 10 bucks--
I like these kind of youtubers that give shoutout to the youtuber they got the idea from
I love John and nessa ❤️❤️
I'm looking at this now and I can't believe that roni and Aaron are married I can't believe it
Please do part two where you switch!!
Switch roles!!
yeah roni and aaron ur date was really good and just bc u didnt have alot of money dosent mean that you cant have fun and laugh
im watching this like 2738461384618648164 times
We Stan Jose from the thrift store 👍😂
I would honestly prefer ronis date than Vanessa’s. It looked like so much fun 😂😂😂😂
Omg roni and Aaron were already engaged when this video was uploaded 🥺💜
PART 2 WITH SWITCH
12:12 - The 10 Dollar date reminds me of first graders in love.
10:29 - Hahahaha❕😄
17:08 🤣🤣
Lol, Aaron's dress does not even look like a dress.!😂
Roni’s and Aaron’s date was like elementary school
Omg Roni and Aaron’s date is so funny and then Nessa and John’s date is just like so fancy
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
WAIT. do nessa and john have matching bracelets?!
Switch roles please with the married couple thinking on how to spend $10000 for the date and how the other couple will make the most out of $10 hehe
I'm sorry RonRon I can't hold my laugh when I saw your outfits hahahahha still cute though hahah
What’s wrong with him rolling his pants up? I thought it was funny and just showed how secure he is with himself..? I feel like everyone was kind of mean to him about it? Why?
Yes do a part 2
DO A PART 2!!!
This was hilarious!! I loved It
Yes switch!
I would love to see the switch
I cant even afford my wedding and they’re spending it all in a day😭
Green green is the color of money hahah
When they said WELL we need money to be happy lmfao 🤣
I like the 10 date so much lol 😂
This was so funny lol
Make a part 2 pleaseeee I wanna see what Roni will do with the 10,000!
It the water bottle for me on the top of the Porsche 😂😂
Omg they posted this on my bday

I like Roni and Aaron’s date lol and I would love to go to a drift store for a date 🤣
Yes switch I wanna see
Aaron: how did you get a Porsche for $10..😂😂😂😂😂😂
Still waiting for part 2...
“It’s the color of money”
I love 10 dollars can make your love bigger
PART 2!!
PLEASE DO THE ROLES REVERSED‼️
I honestly loved both so much 😂♥️ omg the guys are just enjoying the dates , I honestly would of enjoyed either or date , they genuinely both looks so happy I’m glad you all respect each other , I know certain people of been mad about the $10 date but you both took it as a fun creative dates
I think Aaron and Roni should do the $10,000 date since they have been married and it would be their first fancy date since they have been married 💕 also, John going on a $10 sounds funny lol
prove money doesn't buy u happiness
Aaron is a certified Filipino. He knows how to bargain. 😂😅
This video was awesome . Roni and Aaron were so humble and fun
I’m actually really interested in seeing what you and Aaron would do with $10000 for a date!
John seems to be such a great person for Nessa 💜
I loved how John got excited when he said 'Okay' at the same time Nessa did 💔
We loved the 'Fashion Statement'! Uh-huh!
Ronrons date Omgggg 🥺🥺I have to do this with my hubby but maybe 20 bucks date 🤣
Please switch in the next video! I would love to see what Ron Ron goes for
showing his  “Jurassic side” lmaoo
I liked roni and Aaron’s date. Nessa and Johns date was too fancy for me.
YES SWITCH
Nessa has a boy friend ?????
I’m kinda curious how the dates would have been is Roni got $10k and Nessa got $10
Can we have a switched version too? The married couple gets the bougie date and the cute couple gets the cheap date haha
PART 2 PLSSSSSSSSS
PART 2!!!
Yes switch please please please
wht thrift tore did they go to!?!
NO BUT V PLUS A EQUALS VA REALLY GOT ME JKDFJDSFKLSDK
Is it jus me or was Nessa’s date really dry🧍🏽‍♀️
13:46XDDDDD
Is it just me or does nessa look high 👀
one of my fave videos 😂 the editing was perfect
17:13 describes my everyday mood. perfectly
Yea you guys should definitely switch on an other video😄
john is so funnyyyy im cryinggg  😭😭
I’d love to see a part 2 of this with the roles reversed!!
\*Furiously looks thru every video after September 2021 for a ring on Roni's finger*
at 14:59 it was so funny when they were standing there while watching them go on there date LOL 😂😂😂😂
HAHAHAHAHAHHA i love ronnie she’s so quirky and i love nessa she’s so cool
I like how chill Josh is.
plsssaasssss do the switch where this time ronron get 10000
This goes to show that whether you have a lot of money or a little bit of money you just have to be creative 🥰
The fact Ron Ron existed right in front of our eyes but we had no clue. I thought they were so cute together. Love Nessa and Roni, You girls are awesome.
Is supposed be 10 dollar date vs a thousand dollar date
Although Nessa's date seems more fun I think I had more fun watching Roni's lol
I couldn’t stop laughing at aaron’s LOOOONNGG shirt 🤣
I honestly think RonRon’s date was super cute. I’m kind of jealous.
When the chalk holder thing snapped 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 their faces after have me screaminggggg
Ron Ron was so adorable they made the most of the $10 and they were so cute
Ronron is sooo cutee
This was so cuuuuuteeeeee
Who ever edited this to show the comparison between the dates DESERVES A RAISE!
Ronron looks so cute
Roni look so cute
Honestly, I'd rather have Roni's date than Vanessa's cus Idk it was just so much more fun
OK.. I'm loving Ron-Ron's date!!!  lol I kept laughing!
the more i see roni’s outfit the more i like it
Where can I find a guy like John?
I loved nessa and john date 😍❤😍❤😍 but RonRon's date was very cute and hilarious 😂😍
Vanessa you look absolutely stunning 😍
Ron Ron
I can't stop laughing plssss
If you only had $10 for the date I would not have gotten the clothes it would of made the date have a bigger budget and your original clothes was better
Oh maye goshh that swinggg😍😍😍
Aaron said its one of OUR- MY favourite dates
Switch!! Loved to see part 2
13:26 got me bursting in laughter 😂😂😂
The ten thousand date is like the mum and dad having dinner and the ten pound as the kids and money's isn't more important than family and love so I would pick ten pound
Roni and Aaron’s date was more fun. Ness and John looked static and boring
No
Ronnie Date was the best!!
RONRON DATING CONFIRMED!!! Get it? Cuz they went on a date 😂😂😂     I know they're married now 😆😂
"we need money to be happy" - john, 2021  i agree john, i agree.
17:57 V and an A EQUALS VAAAAAAAAAAA
V+A EQuaLS VAAAAAA
This was just one date of 4 years of dates for RonRon…🤯
Please do the switch!!!
Aaron: But to be honest this is one of our- *looks at camera* MY favorite dates  You almost exposed yourself Aaron lol
PART 2 PLSSS
The fact that Aaron and Roni  were engaged at this time and we had no clue about it
Roni’s face at 17:12 🤣
RONRON WAS ENGAGED AT THIS POINT!!!!!!!! AHHAHAH
This is one of my fave videos... the contrast is hilarious!!
Post ronron engagement here and they were engaged is this 🙌🏽
I think any date is fun as long as it’s with the person you love!
Yes you should do it 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
He said “we need money to be happy” oh my gosh I love the 4 of them. 😂😂😂
Wasn’t it $1000?
Did anyone see that Nessa and John have matching bracelets😊so cuuute
that moment at 17:00 was just so cute and sweet
10000 dollars date i watch this video n be like if I get the 10000 this would completely change my life
omg yes swap
I loved Aaron and Veronica's date 😁so much fun!!!
Yesss do the switchhh
17:09 RONI BROKE IT OMG 😭😭 their faces has me dying 😂😭😭
Vanessa and John are so cuteee!! I love how thoughtful Vanessa was by renting the Porsche just for John which was SOO CUTE!! And taking him in the sweetest date and the most memorable date ever!!!! And how RonRon had so much fun together with just $10!! Love their outfits, very fashionable 😍😍
Love ronron’s date!! Proves you don’t need a lot just to have the best date!!
11:50 HELP I WAS LAUGHING SM “come over… nooo!!”
We're waiting on part two :)
one of these couples are married now, guess who
Please switch! Id love to see how nessa and john work out the 10 dollars
John is giving my energy which is no energy. He definitely enjoyed it but he didn't scream "helicopter" w Nessa or anything but he did like the experience and you can tell he liked it cause he paid attention  and from the blue point he could tell it's from the East Coast and he could tell that Nessa's dress had a greco-roman vibe not like your ordinary dude who would just use the word Greek and Goddess cause u look incredibly sexy. Basically he is attentive, intuitive and cultured and definitely appreciative w a calm energy. That is my ideal bf to be honest and I am really happy to see Nessa have that and I hope they last.
PLZZZ Do this vid again but switch noww
🤍🤍🤍
“V+A= VA “🤣🤣🤣
john is so laid back, he feels intimidating lmaoo
stoppp this is so cute
10:29 HAHAHA YOU TWO ARE SO CUTEE!
9:09 pls, that was a dress HAHAHAHA
THIS IS SO FUN TO WATCH! 😂❤
$10,000 is equivalent to P511,500.00 WUT- woahhh that's really a lot.. I can't process how expensive that is HAHAHAHAHA I enjoyed the video by the wayyyy
Looking back at this after Ronni had a  secret boyfriend you can tell like it is soooooo clear
Who else thinks Johns a robot😂
WHEN RONI BROKE THE THING HAAHAH I CANT STOP LAUGHING
Roni and Aaron are my fav couple ever, they’re so cute🥺🤍
bro aaron was concussed at this point, u can see how confused he was
Switch for sure!
watching this after ronron got married 😭
I wanna see it the other way around now lol
imagine if roni and arron were married
I loved both the dates but I love how Roni and Aaron had so much fun and did so much crazy stuff with very less money
DO THE SWITCCHHHHHH
Roni and Aaron’s date was definitely funnier! Loved it 🤣💕
Lmaoooo “king and… queen. 🦗 🦗🦗 I hate those words” had me dying
5:49 Can we appreciate Aaron’s laugh and how cute it was 😂
11:34 uhhuh yea 😂😂😂
PART TWO!!
I think that’d be awesome
Ronron date was soocute
Such a cute video!!!
My hubby and I have really expensive dates.      To the grocery store
Plz do a swap now we know Ron Ron is real but I still don't think it can top this ron ron date 😂❤️❤️❤️
love how they both had the same amount of fun, just goes to show that it’s more about the person not the stuff
Ngl… I loved ronron’s date way better 😌✨ it was so adorable
part 2 please
14:46 because it's the colour of money 😂😂😂😂😂
Who is watching this after the Wedding?
Do a part 2 please!!
Roni you did Aaron so wrong with the outfit lmaaooooo😂😂
Did Nessa try an oyster??
lmaoo, THE COLOR OF MONEY i love his sense of humor
Such a fun idea <3 <3
you should now switch money amounts
YESSS switch, this was funnnnn
14:50 🤣🤣
I did not know Nessa had a bf lol but RonRon's date was adorable❤❤
Vanessa and Johns date was better
I wanna see what Roni would do with $10,000. You should do a reverse where Roni has ten thousand, and Nessa has $10
17:09 🤣🤣
the carrossel part was so cutee
Omg Ron Ron and von von
You should do a part 2
SWITCH ROLES PLSSS
I love how Roni prayed before eating the taco 😭❤️
I want a relationship like Aaron and roni’s😍
Why is John always talking about his dad??? 🤣
PLEASE do a part 2 of roni and aaron going on a $10,000 date! would love to see it
Yes, switch!!! I’m curious to see how your respective dates would turn out.
why aren't we talking about how it's not 10000 it's 1000 which is a lot but 10000$ is false
They keep saying ten thousand (10,000)but it’s only ten hundred (1,000) like they don’t know how to math lol
Do the opposite!!!!
hahaha Roni's date was the best for sure♥
SORRY NESSA THE PORSCHE IS SO MUCH  NICER  THEN YOUR DREAM CAR 🚗 BMW WITH NO ROOM.
Y’all should totally do it where Ron Ron gets 10,000 dollar one !
I love the 10 dollar one
Honestly I feel like Roni and Aaron's date was way more fun ahaha!
*Roni and aaron get home dressed all funny and stuff* John “ we need money to be happy” Lmaaoaoooaa
Yessss do the switch!!!
Nessa looks INCREDIBLE in that dress. wow
Green=Money
this is my fav video ever 😭😭
switch please!!
I can’t stop thinking john is.. gay or bi.. which is fine but is he really her bf? Can’t be just me ? Is it?
Did they ever switch and do it? I want to watch.
Nessas date was more cool but i feel like roni  date they had more fun
What am i the only one that did not now that nessa have a bf
The fact that Aaron and Roni were engaged at this point and we didn't have a single clue 😂so happy for you guys!
Aaron + Roni super cute
lol love it
Veronica's and Aaron's date was very cute, Vanessa's and John's date was very bougie, and I'd like to see a part 2 where you switch dollar amounts.
Roni: I made a rainboww thiss is so much fun Nessa: I feel like a billon dollars
Back here to figure out if ronron was engaged in this video 😂
Both the dates were soo different yet sooo amazing!! ❤️🤩
patytm hehehe
John is so calm and everything and I feel like he doesn’t like have emotions 😂😂
Who else came here after their marriage announcement 🙈
i would love to see a video in reversed roles!
Aw no wonder he wanted to take her on a nice date...celebrate the engagement🎉
Ronron where engaged by then!!!
YES PLEASE SWITCH! <3 LOVED THISSS
Who knew that 2 months later Ron I and Aron are married!
I get such off vibes from Vanessa's personality now compared to Roni..
There are $1000 and $10000 bills. They just are not practical for regular circulation.
Yes you definitely should do a part 2 where Roni and Aaron go on the $10,000 date and Nessa and John go on the $10 date
This is so different after hearing tat Aaron and roni were dating and now  they’re married!!!???
Jose and Venessa what other stuff did you do before you went on the date🤔🧐💋💞
roni: my date was great. i think it brought me and aaron closer together  nessa: nice car, nice dinner, nice clothes
Brandon is soo jealous right now if you guys know what I am talking about
This shows that dates aren’t about money, it’s about the fun you get out of the date
I love these couple videos 🥰🥰
the fact that roni and Aaron were engaged in this time blows my mind
You should do a part two but swap the money 💴 .And I would go on the 10 doller dote
Y'all Roni was engaged by this time
Aaron is continuing to break the gender norms with his dress, Roni should be encouraging him!
the $10 daate was o funny lmfaooooo
"So I have this fun little sports car" *shows porsche that probably has 500 hp*
I started laughing so hard what Aaron and Veronica spent their last 50¢ on 🤣 I feel like they got the perfect challenge of spending $10. It’s so Aaron and Veronica 🤣
Honestly roni’s food prayer was so sweet
Clickbait and 0 originality sorry just being honest 👎🏽
No one would have imagined roni being engaged a week before this video was posted
“we need money to be happy” HES NOT WRONGJFJDJ
That was cute
DO THE SWAP PLEASE !!
10 dollar date
So weird to watch this now knowing that Aaron and Roni were engaged during this time!
Anyone gonna talk about how beautiful nessa was!?!? AND THE DRESS
14:21 I died lmaoo😂😂
the odyssey is a beautiful restaurant definitely recommend sitting outside the view is amazing. the food isn’t bad but it’s not out of this world either.  it’s in granada hills so if you live near there you should try it.
PLEASE DO THE SWAP i just wanna see how nessa and John will make the most of it and how Roni and Aaron would have used the money because i feel like it would've been a lot different than nessa and John did
Roni and Aron are a great couple
"we need money to be happy" HAHAHAHAH
Nessa and John are so cute together
Rich twin vs poor twin
why is john has no exitment
I love watching you girls love the part were roni and Aaron were on the carisel I also loved the part where John said here is the colour of money
nessa
The part where Roni and Aaron watched Vanessa and her boyfriend get into the car and drive off got me rolling😂😂
‘Well we need money to be happy’ that’s just sounded so wrong lol 😂
17:11 that part made me cried for roni 😭✋🏻😂💀
John: u look likz a greek godess Nessa:*hearts melt
Roni and Aaron’s date was funny because Roni sprayed Aaron’s butt
Can you do $10.000 and $10.00
roni and aron a a very cute cupple
You guys should do this again, but give Roni and Aaron the $10,000 and Nessa and John the $10.
Yeeeeeeeesssssss
Aron:heheh 5:47
When they were fighting to go first into Taco Bell cause they’re outfits 😂
Roni and Aaron's date looked so fun negl..AWWWW
Bwahaha why does Ron Ron’s date seem like another day… wait does that mean everyday of them together is a date?!
Johns ment for the helicopter 🚁 life
Yess do a pt2!!!!!!
Guys why can't you just get married you're 25 every day it breaks me that you aren't married
2
Roni and Aaron’s date was more like cute,cheap,dont care ab others opinion And Johna and Nessa’s date was rich,adult,rich married couple vibes
I liked roni and Aaron’s date more bcs it’s actually really fun lol I love them😂😂😂
Are you guys actually 22 you look 19
what was that 18:09
15:00 I can’t believe they just left poor Aaron and Roni😂
Aaron:I like the green  John: because it’s the colour of money Me :feeling bad for Roni and Aaron while laughing my head off
WHEN RONRON WENT TO THE MINI COROUSELL😭😭💀💓 I LOVE THEM
It dose not matter if the money but that video was great but I like the 10 dollar outfit they wereeeemi guess cool and the 10,000 dollar okay I loved the dress so much!
I love how roni is so cautious🤣
Vanessa and John they date was awesome 😎😎😎
WE NEED PART 2!!!!
Roni and Aaron’s date was litterly the cutest thing but love both. You guys are awesome💞🌸
I can't even begin to fathom a $10,000 date. I can't even imagine spending $10,000 on an entire week worth of dates. That's an insane amount of money. If I got $10K it would quite literally fix all but 2 problems I have right now for at least 6 months.
Poor Roni and Aaron
All hail nessa Greek goddess yay
SWITCH!!
John is just so nonchalant love that
I WANT A RELATIONSHIP LIKE RONI AND AARON!! 😭❤️
😊 thanks
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo switching🙏🏻👍🏻
Yes
If I was roni and had to use $10 I’d do the same thing but buy a prom dress and suit at the thrift store
Honestly roni and aarons date seemed way more fun and weird and I like that, it’s a whole experience!
I know that Veronica and Vanessa are twins but Vanessa looks like Pierson
Honestly, Roni and Aaron was 10/10
Yes switch it!!
when roni and aaron prayed for their food 🥺 also loved this videoo 😌
I love your video
Vanessa: I've asked Jasmine of my friends  Me saying in my head: my name is Jasmin
my ron ron heart🥺❤️
They should do this again with 20 dollars and 20 thousand
13:42
You guys should definitely switch roles
Switch
Nessa and Jhon are like the parents that went on a date and RONI and Aaron are there kids that stayed home
John and Nessa really be pulling of rich couple then RonRon be like: weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ahhhhhh the 50 cent carousel is to fastttttttttttttttt I loved the RonRon one 3000 but the Johnessa one was super cool
I honestly would rather go on the 10 dollar date it just seems more fun and goofy and creates a huge bind
NICE ITS OFFICIAL
Yes please be part 2 ten dollar date ten thousand dollar date part 2 Veronica and Arron have ten thousand dollar date and Vanessa and jhon will have 10 dollar date
switch do it
All the revenue from this video better have gone to roni
I need a full video of just roni & Aarons date 😆
Please make the roles reversed !!
pls switch....i wanna watchhhhhh...plsssssssssssssssss
I love the 10,000 date
Not me noticing that in the helicopter ride they flew by the same place as in GTA
Plzz do part 2 and switch roles
I like ronis date better
I hope y’all tipped Jose well
Please switch roles
10,000 date
Roni and Aaron are serious couple goals! I loved their date!
Why do i want part 2 to this just really curious what would nessa and john's 10 dollar date would look like
i am just saying,  if her boyfriend breaks up with her after that 10k dinner, helicopter ride, and a fun time, id honestly think he never loved me in the first place.   lol!  honestly, both dates seem like a blast! thanks for posting every week, and making our life` s better <3
I love how roni’s date is outside and nessa’s was inside
For Twins I notice Roni’s voice was a more higher pitch than Nessas
Part 2! Part 2! Part 2!
Part2!
"V + A = VA"
I thoroughly enjoyed third wheeling Aaron and Roni's date. They are so cuteee. It was like watching a rom-com ❤
You guys should totally switch and do a part 2!!!
U should definitely switch
Why dose it feel like vensessa is scared of jhon?
Plss do a part twooo2s2
Yes you guys should switch lol loved this video 🤍
Shoutout to Jose
It looks like kids waving off there perants
Lol isn’t that a $1,000 date not a $10,000? Eh either way this vid was cute
roni and aaron praying before they ate their tacos was so adorable!! 🥺😌
Part 2.!!!!!!!!!!!!
"you look like a greek goddess" just marry her already.
The 10$ date was the best
Yk that 10, 100 dollar bills is only 1000? Not 10,000
john is hilarious, had me literally lol'ing
I actually had more fun watching the $10 date! Lol
RON RON <333
Tbh cheapest date is more fun than expensive date
Yesssss switch!!!
Switch
Wait since when were vanessa and John dateing
I LOVE THEM SOO MUCH XD THIS WAS HILARIOUS
Aaron and Roni’s date is the moSt genuine and cutest!!! They are so sweet🥺❤️ proves that money doesn’t buy you love to be happy. I am so proud!
RONI'S DATE IS THE CUTEST THING EVER, I LIKE HOW SIMPLE IT IS🥰
It's not all about money You don't need Money for everything
if these men dont treat these beautiful girl right, i will find them and cut their mustaches and hair. they deserve a lot in life.
Can you please do more challenges with them ! I really enjoy watching them videos ! Love you guys so much xx
is roni and aaron boyfriend and girfriend?
Part 22222222222222
you guys look so pretty in this video
Roni: “V+A=~Va~” Aaron: “I thought we were RonRon”
This is literally like me being Roni and my sisters are nessa
Roni looks like a dutch person on king’s day lol
aaron and roni's date is such a vibe❤️
I think you should switch it would be fun
I honestly thought Roni's date was better BhaHah
Jose appreciation comment ✨
Yes switch!!
they both just wanted to have a nice date with their significant other :)
Yeah please switch the dates 😀😀
I really would love it if you switched
I like rich date more
Please have a part two of this dates
you should definitely try switch
i think john likes the word OK
Vanessa: “We’re going on a helicopter ride!!” 😊☺️😁 John: “wait really” 😐🥸
We need part 2!!
$1000 bills. I swear the people y’all look up to (that are “rich”) are real life dummies.
Yes for sure
I love Roni’s date😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤍🤍🤍🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤💙💙💙
If my dates aren’t like Aaron’s and Roni’s I don’t want it
I love your guys channel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
love roni's and aaron's date!!
10,000 date
Isn't 10 100$'s just 1,000 dollar so it should be 10$ date vs 1,000 date😂
John" OoOoOOOOOOoooooO!" for like the millionth time..
poor roni
Swiiiiitch...🙏🏽🙏🏽😆😘. My first comment was before I watched the whole vid. Buh nessa agrees💃💃💃🌟💥🥰
I feel like thy should repeat ths challenge  Buh experience the other people's choices... Like nessa 10$ and roni 10,000 Jus for fun
maybe you guys could switch and roni gets the 10,000 dollar date and nessa gets the 10 dollar date
NOP
I bet roni s date was better
YES PLEASE DO A PART 2!!! 🥰
YES YES YES SWITCH SWITCH
I’m gonna try the $10 date!!
For the $10 date I would go for a picnic and a walk. For the $10k date I would obviously gtfo of the U.S. and find one of those places with fine scenery.
so exoensive omg
lol aaron
Definitely switch and do a part two!!
Roni and Aaron’s date made me love them even more🥺💞
aaron and roni’s dates is actually funny and cute
Pleaseee switch
Switch
In my opinion nessa’s date was cool but but boring and roni’s date was funny and fun but no hate at all this is just in my opinion
You guys should switch $10 and $10,000 for another video
I like how it is 20 mins and 20 sec
Lowkey Aaron and Roni’s date go hard 😭🔥 it looked like so much fun
Part 2
THE CAROUSEL PART THOOOOOOOO OMG THAT IS SO WHOLESOME
Yeah do s part two and switch
Hahaha! Roni looks like a gardener!
2
Vannessa: “Delicious dinner beautiful view best date ever!”  Veronica:”WHAT??!!YOU BROKE THE CHALK!!!”
YES PLEASE SWITCH! WAITING FOR PART 2
2:00 Actually 1,000 dollar bills do exist. They're just rare. 👀👀👀
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
DO ANOTHER ONE!
I would wanna go on roni and Aron type of date because that’s my type of date
this was GOLD 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I feel so bad 😢
Roni and Aaron’s date was better and cute
Funfact:In my country *Philippines* we have ₱1000
im actually so surprised how cheap everyday stuff is there! Where I live a singular can of soft drink anywhere would be around $6, so you couldn't even successfully get two drinks without spending over the $10 date budget lol
If they get married and have kids Aaron and Roni would be the fun parents and Nessa and John would be like the cool serious parents
"V plus A equals VA"
Honestly, in my opinion, i think roni and aaron's date is cuter
Ron Ron date was the best! Just having the $10 makes it a fun challenge and it turns out to be a fun date 🙌🏻
Switch pls!!!
When Roni broke the chalk thing I was dying on the floor the silence was SO LOUD
this is so cuteeeee.I love when aaron says "fashion statement"🤣
Im glad nessa didn't rush to get a boyfriend, john and her makes such a good pair together❤❤
Next Video: SWITCH
Switchhh
I love this video! It's so funny!🤣 14:50 Vanessa's laugh😂 plus the cool outfits😅❤
14:50 nessa would never laugh like that at Pauls jokes lmao
Vanessa dosnt seem the same anymore
Ronnie's date with Aaron was cringy 😂
I’d probably go on The $10 one it looked so fun and casual! I mean I’d go on both but the other one was a waste of money! This video has been so funny though!😂 Have a wonderful Day/Night everyone!💕
I love the dimple’s you have
I didn’t even know nessa had a boyfriend but he looks super sweet I’m super glad nessa found a good guy
Do a part 2 plz🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏and exchange the amounts💯💯It would be a perfect video👌👌👌👌
I think this just shows that a good date isn't based on money, it's about the person you're with. ^-^
Vanessa:And I am gonna take MY BOYFRIEND JOHN on a date Le me:Sayyy whaaaaatttt?????!!!!!? What about CHRISTIAN
i genuinely think roni and aaron had the best time ever lmaooo
My name is Veronica-(:
both dates were amazing but i will say that roni and arrons date was a lot more like the merrell twins but nessa and jonathans date was way more sophisticated than what the merrell twins usually are and how they act.But at least both of them either liked or loved their dates and to me thats all that matters.
John said ok so many times  🤣
this means Johnessa is finally real!!!
RONRON IS INITIATING PEOPLE!!
Arron: you know what that means, we have exactly 50 cents left roni  Roni: i know exactly what the means  I ACC COULDNT BREATH😂😂😂😂😂
what happened to christian
you should do the part two so roni and Aaron can have the ten thousand dollar date!
It Seems Like A Challenge But A Skit 😂
Aron and Roni's day was the best
Poor Ronnie
I thought Nessas boyfriend was Christin
I love videos when Aaron and Roni hangout it’s always so funny
THE HORSIES ARE THE CUTEST THIING
I feel like that Pierson (from the AMP world) looks a lot like Vanessa and Roni, maybe you should do a collab
19:45 I agree!!!!!!! You should do that 😭😭
The roles need to switch
I love this! I truly would enjoy both but I think dates like the ten dollar date is more fun!  It think it would be cool to see a part 2 to swap
Did I miss anything? Nessa has s bf?!?!??
Hey Vanessa merrelle I love your boyfriend John music video so much and please put a heart on this comment and have a wonderful night.
When the person is right you,all have fun with whatever you have
I want you guys to switch roni is gonna have a 10,000 dollar date with Aaron and Vanessa and John with 10 dollars.
I love how Aaron just let ronni have most of the budget
Waiting for partt twooo
I felt so bad for Aaron at the beginning he was expecting an actual date 😭
by far the funniest video of yours! I loveeeed ronron's date, it's adorable
What a fun video the next one should be the guys vs the girls who would get the 10,000 dollars 👀
this is so funny! :)
Roni disinfecting herself and Aaron is the best! 😂😂😂😂
I heared Aaron and thought Eren
Vanessa and John’s date was cool but Veronica and Aaron’s were so cute can’t stop smiling watching them partly cause it’s funny lol
PART 2 PLEASE!!!
$10 for the winnnnn
Yess pls make a pet two were you guys switch
Just the way the boys look at Nessa and Roni🥺🖤
ron ron and jessa
Aaron is Nora a now xx lol
Roni and Arrons date is better Bc they were having Fun nessa seems like she would be with a different person..
10 is awesome 💯✌️😃🤗🐥
I LOVE THE 10$ DATE ..... MAKES ME HAPPY, 🤗🌹♥️🇺🇸🙏🤓👍
ok bur did anyone realises for aaron and roni it was light outside but for vennessa and her boyfriend date was dark outside lol
i loved this but PLEASE DO THE SWITCH TOO
I loved the content!
Switch plssss
nessa’s boyfriend is so dry 😭
Yes you  should probably exchange cuz we need to see how ur ideas will be then
Yes please make a part two  And I'd like to say that roni and aaron's date was ta very fun date and it did bring them very close to eachother  on the other hand I think John cares a little about money more then Nessa But I liked the Aaron and roni's date more because love is free it doesn't cost dollars❤
now i dont believe if someone said ronron isnt real
I think their dates definitely matched their personalities because Roni seems goofy and Nessa has more of a boogie personality. But I would love to see another one where they are switched!
Ok but Nessa's hair is stunning wavy!!
This is the best I’ve seen 😍😍✨
"you look like a greek goddess" made me melt ngl 😭
There is a 1,000 dollar bill
part 2 switch please 🥺👉🏻👈🏻
Can we just appreciate Jose from the thrift store and his wholesomeness
I died when I saw roni's outfit  edit: I just saw Aarons outfit Me=😣🤔😝
Roni and Aaron have the cutest date
Why was I cheesin’ so hard whenever Roni & Aaron popped up😂 They’re so cute☺️🥺🥰
Please make a Part 2 where you switch roles ❤️
YES! SWITCH BUDGETS NEXT
No one: John: “we need money to be happy”, “it’s the color of money”
I love Aaron and Roni’s date
RonRon’s date was so cuteeeee 😭❤️
please make a part 2 and switch😆❤️
You can just tell that John isn't a YouTuber
I'm kinda confused is Roni and Aaron dating?
personally i think roni and aaron’s date was better
Switch switch
Waiting for a part 2
Yeah i think you should do a part 2 to see what will roni and aaron do with the 10,000 dollars................
She has a boyfriend
I like how honest John is when he reacts to things and how it blends well with Nessa more hyper feelings. Although, when she's with Roni, she's the one less expressive ahhahha
Switch role pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeas
We need a part to
Am I the only one who was like 10 Of 100’s……??? That’s 1,000 unless….. she used the rest in card lol idk I’m just confused
RonRon still the best!💗
PLEASE DO THE SWITCH CHALLENGE
Loved the 10 dollar date the most 😂❤️❤️
What the in nessa date its night and roni its day waht....
Aron and roni were so cute together, they were always a great couple 💖 but  nessa and Jhon don't have that ( no hate, just my opinion)
yes do a part two please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I liked roni and arons datę better sorry nessa like if you. agree
I don’t like Johns vibe 😐
Ofc you have to do a part 2, i wana see roni being rich

Yesss you should do a part two
You guys are amazing. Never fail to make me laugh.
Yes.
Yes switch!!!!!
Yesss switch it was aw
Im sorry, I skipped through Nessa's date. 🥺 I guess I was more intrigued on how they'd fit the $10. But if it was converted to my country's currency $10 would be A LOT. ❤️
Part 2 please part 2 part 2...
How did u get a porche for 10 dollars?
WE NEED A PART 2!!!!
Part 2 please when they switch btw RonRon are the CUTEST
I haven’t watched them in a few months because school has been making me busy. But oh my God Nessa has a boyfriend!! Nessa has a boyfriend!!!! Oh my goodness she said she would never get a boyfriend that’s a lie I’m so happy for her! Yay!
it’s a $1000… not $10,000!! so annoying when you literally counted it out and still kept saying $10,000
I knew this would happen 🤣🤣 Btw the look on Aaron's face 5:58 🤣🤣
SWITCH
I feel like roni needs a better dat
13:51 I sometimes lift my pants up but not all the way up like how Aaron did.
Are nessa still dating that guy
Wait … is Ronron official????? tea
Definitely switch roles for the next video :)
FORRR SURE, YOU GUYS SHOULD DEFINITELY DO THE DATE SWAPPED
I actually like ten dollar date more (I would bring my boyfriend on the ten dollar date.)

I love Nessa's dress and Roni fun date
I miss christian I don't like john

I gotta say when they talked about the 50 cents that is not what I expected.. but I still loved it! 😂
I LOVE THE LITTLE PRAYER SOOO CUTE!!
I would love to see a part 2
Nessa and John look like the parents and roni and Aron look like the kids 🤣
John is soooooo ungrateful ( no hate )
I just realized that to be happy it depends more about the people that is around u than money haha roni's date was much more fun 😂
Roni spraying Aaron and herself has me dying😂😂
please do this again!!
what a cute date together aww..
I feel bad for roni and aron man john and nessa are flexers  Roni and aron:👩‍❤️‍👨🥲
Switch!!
Is it weird to say that I actually would love to do roni & Aaron’s date🤣🤣 so sentimental and it just so cute to see how much they enjoy they’re time together no matter what they do
I love both dates so much!! I feel like I can relate so much to both dates. I would actually enjoy them both! Lmao and YES!! Do a SWAP!!
I think y’all should do a part 2!!!😛‼️👋
Switch rolessssss
I was thinking you guys should do a flip!!! That would be so fun! I’d love to see how Nessa would make the $10 last and I’d love to see how far Roni would go with $10,000!
Nessa's date was perfect... But I absolutely loved roni and Nessa's date😂💕💕
YES! Switch it so that Aaron and Roni gets the 10,000 and Nessa and Jon get the 10! Would love to see that
I can't with Roni and Aaron... they made me laugh the whole time 😂😂😂😂
PLEASEEE do a part 2 that would be so fun omg
wow john is actually very witty and smart
that part in the carousel ride was so cute and funny😂  I want to try it myself😍HAHHAHAHA
nessa should’ve gave roni the $10,000
I love how creative Aaron and Roni were, we want a part 2!!💓
John is the chilliest man I've ever seen
Are u guys Christians?  Our family is too
Roni date is soo cute 🥰
YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND?.?
Awwww man, nessa and john are so cuteeee
You guys should definetely switch. I really wanna see roni with 10 000 dollars and nessa with 10 dollars.
You should do another video where you switch!
TEAM JOSE WITH THE DEALS
This was such a fun idea and still taught a lesson. Both dates were great in their own way. The $10 date was so wholesome, funny, cute and it was about spending time together. Making the most out of what you have. The $10,000 date did have a lot of cool experiences, and it showed the places you can go. I can see how their personalities, just like the room tours, showed through the date. But all in all,  loved to see that both couples enjoyed spending time with one another. The sarcasm was great, too!
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE RONI GET THE TEN THOUSAND AND NESSA GET TEN DOLLARS
Aaron be showing that he is indeed a filipino HAHAHAHA
Omg you guys should do a double date like dressing up fancy and driving a fancy car or something 🙈
RONIS DATE WAS THE   BESSSTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
nessa date is way older  thanher like in his 40 v
you should switch it would be so funny
What happend to Christian?
aww i love how you two (''RON RON'') prayed before your meal 😍
Why dose your bf look like a old man dad tho 🤔
NESSA HAS A BOYFRIEND
Swap! Let Roni have the $10,000 date and Nessa have the $10
Please do a part 2
Yes please do part two but switching
Drop a like for roni
You guys should do a switch! It would be so much fun. Love the video
Nessa and John's date was like a professional date?? but Roni and Aaron's date was chaotic and cute😭
15:03 kids telling bye to their parents
Commenting just so I can watch Ron Ron get their 10 000 date!
I love how John look at Nessa's eyes cause you can really tell that He's inlove with Nessa 👀😍❤️
Roni is me spraying the Lysol 😂🤣
i enjoyed this video so much
Why have I been seeing this everywhere on my recommended, it’s like life wants me to watch this 😂😂😂
‘Got done’...
math strong point but 10,000 dollars  devied by 10 dollars equals 1000 Veronica and Arron dates. they don't do all once both combined need come 500 10 dollars dates that all diffrent. first girl does 500 dates through corse You tub carer wins something. keep years take do that many dates.
I died at 13:25 YALL are too cute
You guys should defo switch and make a vid abt it
Switch dates part 2 vote 🗳
Ronnie's date was so cute
all the guys from twin my heart are punching the air rn
Im always happy when I hear my favorite Influencers talk about each other because everyone else on tiktok is out for each other’s throats 0:28
I need a part 2!
Poor Veronica
This shows how diverse L.A is.
yes, switch it will be amazing
I would love to see this swapped the other way lol great idea !
I for sure want to see what Nessa would make out of the $10. We need to see a switch lol
Ooh switch places! Roni has the 10000 and nessa has the 10
I love how John said, "well we need money to be happy" because he said it sarcastically cos' they won the $10,000 date so they needed to spend that. But srsly he knew, he & nessa could still have fun with only $10 just like roni and aaron. Cute.
SWITCH!!!!!
Roni: V+A= Va  Roni looked cute while saying that🥺  I lau
SINCE WHEN DID NESSA HAVE A BF
This is so off topic but nessas dimples are too cute🥰🥰
that was so fun i think you guys should do another video where you swap so nessa is 10 d and roni is 10000 d
YESSSS DO A SWITCH YASSSSSSS
John : “You look like a Greek Goddess .  Nessa : smile 😊 ❤️
Johnessa ❤️🌹 they were so cute when they on a date and I think it’s very romantic and mature adults thing . Vanessa is also very funny and pretty . John is very handsome and very likely to sing a song with Vanessa . Vanessa and John is a very cute couples . ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Go for REVEEEERSE ❤️
PART 2 SWITCH YES PLEASEEEEEEEEEE

when roni and aaron were just looking at nessa and john getting in the car, i literally laughed so much 😭😭😭😭😭
YES DO THE SWITCH
yessss do the part 2 !!!!!
roni: “v+a= vah!” IM DYING 😭💀
i’m so happy for nessa. she finally found a sweet guy for her <3
Idc what you say Roni and Aaron are so wholesome and can make any date amazing.
How did you get a Porsche for ten dollars 😂
Yes switch so it’s fair!
I LOVED Roni's and Aarons date. It was the BEST. They should switch it up next time.
YES YOU GUYS SHOULD SWICH!
I died of laughter when Roni broke her chalk toy 😂❤️Their expressions were ... magical ✨
Wait! Roni and Aaron date is soooo beautiful and adorable! 😭❤️✨
Ok so I have to go with team Ron Ron!!!! They had so much fun!!!
"Its the color of money" after John said that I got a tiny bit mad idk why I just did but its alright as long as nessa and roni are happy I am happy:)
Veronica's date was childlike and the date of Vanessa more adult. But i liked Veronica's better, because they had more interaction and fun
Yes we do need to see the switch
We need a part 2
*Me takes a break after a super looong time due to stuff* Also me: VANESSA HAS A BOYFRIEND!?!?
Team roni and aron..
I love how roni dose not care about the money love you btw
How did you get a Porsche for $10?? 😂😅 aaaaaaw ..!
Roni and Aaron's date was soooo cute!!!
4:51 I'm crying 😂😭 Roni is so small it's adorable 😂❤️💕
DO A PART 2!!!!
at 16:57 arron says "this is on of OUR-" but then he rephrases it and says "my fav like dates"
I love this video! Nessa had a more mature date but u could tell how giddy she was the whole time, it was cute to see. Ronron had so much fun and laughs, it just fit with their personalities.
Ronrons date seem so much more fun
18:10 what was that guy doing.he is sus lol 😆
Part 2 pls
seems like ronnie had more fun than vanessa xD
I want to seee a part 2 of thisss for sureee
Ronnie and Aaron has the date because it about love not money they r happy and a lovely and if they had 10 000 they still have a good date but again it not about the money it about love and being happy
I think Ronnie and Aaron is the cutest because it not about the money it about love
Yesssss switch!!!!!!!!!!!!!
15:05 nessa and john looks like parents and aaron and roni looks like their childrens HAHAHSHS
for me, I think Roni and Aaron won this challenge because not everyone has $10,000, most people just have $10 or less, and Roni and Aaron really showed us that you can do a lot with just $10 and I think that's just so sweet of them.
Yeahhhhhh do a swap :))
Boring date by Nessa
Nessa's was so boring since John one hella killjoy
Roni:hi Aaron Aaron:hi roni Meanwhile Vannessa:hey Jhon:hey
John is either shy on camera or awkward coz im picking up the vibe that he doesn’t wanna be there idk why
yes we would love to see switch
Please do a part 2!!!! Switching would be so fun! :)
john is giving me awkward vibes, like he is so stiff
i'd prefer a ten dollar date tho i think a simple date is romantic.
nessa look different. just a little ive never seen her hair that curled before
Please tell us if ronron is true ❤️ we are so excited
Video was hilarious
YES DO OART 2
Can they switch now?
What happened too Alex?
Vanessa and her bf are such a cute couple
Do the switch
Should of given them ten more dollars for praying before their meal.
15:00 it’s like children watching their parents go to work in the early morning while still in their pj’s 😂 😆
They should switch and have Roni and Aaron get a 10,000$ date
When are you guys going to restock the vvm hoodie?? I want one :(
‘How did you get a Porsche for $10’ the way Aaron was attached to the Porsche 😂😂
Aaron and Roni need a fancy date now
yall should try the 100 piece puzzle challenge my family started it pls check it out luv yalls vids!!!
Ron Ron won this date
Yes do a part 2 please
I'm just kidding
Thank you for the date
Johns excitement tho, It’s the best😭
I love how automatically Aaron thinks the porsche is his LOL
Roni's date.... I would like better I don't know why it just seemed more fun!
Roni and Aaron’s date are literally the same dates my boyfriend and I go on 😂❤️ sometimes we splurge and go to Chili’s hahaha!
Definitely switch!!
Them.Ya will smith waved at us and he said come on my next  movie no were busy. me dying on the floor from laughing
Vanessa and Josh when they had the seak the woman was looking at them very 🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐 yea but Roni and Aaronwas cute BTW💕
Honestly if I had to choose between both dates, I'd go for Ronis and Aaron 🙆 Both were great, but Ronrons was just ... More comfy, fun and simple? I love that. (And yes i know, simple because they had less money, but still.)
Omg I feel so bad for Aaron he thought the car was there's lol
part two
Wait, isn’t it actually a $1000 date technically?
I definitely think ron, ron should get a crack at doing a 10,000 dollar date however I'd like to see the girl do a $50 all day challenge and they can't use anything currently owned (clothes and transportation included).
I mean money dosent buy happiness
roni and aarons was better because they were just enjoying eachother's company
I definitly think you should switch and see what the other person makes of the money!! I love you Merrel twins!!
im begging you please do a pt 2 I would be so fun to see!
I want to see them switch the roles!
Great video, random thought-  I think they should change their channel's aesthetic for a change.  And do more challenges like these 👍🏻
part 2 where you switch!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ok. Now switch date amounts!
I have a question, are you guys Christians? Because if you are I think that's really cool because I am.
Nessa: we're going on a helicopter ride😄 John: wow ok😅
15:05 Toni and Aron waving goodbye to they’re mom and dad leaving
5:33 john is funny
Im sorry but why is john so unenthusiastic
Now u guys need to swop really wanna see Aaron and Ronni on a 10000 dollar date and Nessa and John on the 10 dollar date please do it!!!!
YES
Waiting for the reversed dates! You guys are lovely btw.
Why don't u still date christian😢😢😭😭
I want to see y’all do tell my twin what to say prank 😂💯
Toni and Aaron’s date went the best shows you don’t need money to be happy! You too would make such a cute 🥰 couple
I love nessa and john together they have such a great dynamic
It’s cause its the color of money🤣🤣🤣
Yall are running out of ideas please be like the old merelltwins youre channelis kinda getting boring like where is the skits ? Sorry for bad grammar im still a subscriber but i do not binge warch ur vids anymore like i did the past years.
Nessa and Ronis dates matches their personalities so well cause roni is more goofy and nessa seems to have a more bougie personality
I’m assuming that Roni and Aaron is a thing now?
this may be my favourite merrell twins video ever
Switchhh!! 💕😁
Why do I get a feeling that the helicopter ride was inspired from Brooklyn and Bailey 😆💖 Much love 💕
I started dying of laughter when roni snapped the chalk thingy their looks of pure disappointed
I 100% choose Roni and Aaron's date. So sweet and fun ❤️ great video! ☺️
Aaron and ronis date was adorable like that date was superior
i love how nessa gets so nervous and cute when shes with john
You should definitely switch and do it the other way! I’d love to see what Ron Ron does with 10K
Swiiiitch
Cheap date looked more fun!
Yeah do the switch!
I really loved Aaron and Roni's date because it had me laughing the whole time.
Toni and Aaron’s date was the best 💕😆

Guys I thought  Nessa was dating christ
Do a switch part. It will be fun.
I prefer Roni and Aaron's date but nessa's have a nice date too
The only important thing is that you have eachothers company which will make any date amazing
Please do the switch, with Roni $10k and Nessa $10 date
Now you got to do the same video but your sister has $10 and you have 10,000

The moment that Aron showed his outfit I literally couldn't stop laughing 😂😂😂❤️ they are the cutest and the coolest couple ever❤️
Roni and Aaron's date is just W H O L E S O M E
$1000 bills used to be a thing back in the 30s President Cleveland's face was on it. It was the second largest banknote circulated among the public, the largest being the $5000 bill (with James Madison's face). The other two banknotes larger than that were the $10000 and the 100000, but those were used only by the government for official transactions.  Fun fact, the rarest banknote still produced today is the $2 bill. Ask for some when you go to the bank! 😁
WE WANT PART 2!
I do think that you guys should do a part 2….it would be awesomely fantastic experience
Can we see the same thing, but Roni gets 10000 dollars and Nessa 10 Dollars for a date?
Do the video again but stwich roles!!
I vote for RONRON's 🧡date.  It was so much fun watching them, I was laughing out loud it was so great🤣🤣🤣. Meanwhile, VJ's date was luxurious and cool. I like the helicopter ride date too. This video is 💯🧡🧡
I was literally laughing in a public space like a crazy person when Roni and Aaron stood there while Nessa and John drove off in the Porsche …. I’d like to see  Roni and Aaron go on a fancy date all dressed up … they’re so ☺️
Maybe the next video might be a part 2.
I love Aaron and roni,s date ♥️

I am surprised that roni didn't say my boyfriend Aron  at the beginning
I kept smiling so much seeing nessa and John together ☺️
Love the $10 date and aaron and veronica couldnt done it better! ❤️
I feel like nessas date is more about money but not going to judge you do you girl

yeah  money allows you to do anything and everything and happiness is short lived. but being with the right person that's a life time of happiness. I love how they both cherished their moments with their partners.

When ness and john walked out.. roni and aarons faces had me rolling LOL
It would be nice to see what you guys would do if you switched I think a part 2 is a must 💜
John does not match her energy but I love themm
I'm finally convince, aaron is really a certified filipino because of his bargain techniques / "tawad po" moment in the thrift store🤣 filipinos out there if u know, u know
Please make the switch video !! That would be a cool video
Yes switch !!
Please do this again, just flipped!!!! SO funny!
I laughed throughout at Roni and Aaron
John's "we need money to be happy" is a mood 😭😭😭
I loved ur guys dates it was so Cute 😊
i’m glad vanessa and roni both have amazing boyfriends❤️❤️❤️
Nessa looked fabulous for her date and the porche was awesome.  Helicopter was awesome too. Give major props to Roni for making the most of the $10. That's the most realistic  one. All activities must be in budget or you become homeless. At least that's the case for almost everything.
Can I guys play squid game
when they are leaving in the Porsche and Aaron and Toni were standing there made me die laughing, they looked fire btw I mean ness and John
Please switch!!
Roni and Aaron are so cute and genuine
Yes switch it
Ye su guys should switch I wanna see more Ron Ron !
You should really wash clothes from a thrift store you can bring home bedbugs!

God loves us so much that He sent His one and only son to die on the cross for our sins...so please Repent from your sins and ask for forgiveness the punishment of sin is death...

Cute couples
Hi there stranger. You don't know me but I wanted to spread the good truth of Jesus Christ if you would like to take the time to stay and learn more.  See God created the first of humankind and gave our first descendants dominion over the earth and things in it but we soon rebelled against God and so sin was born into the knowledge and actions of humankind. Thankfully enough we have the opportunity to rid ourselves of sin and reconcile with God the holy father through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ the son of God. He died on the cross for our sins and took the punishment we were supposed to receive, defeating sin in the process and freeing whosoever seeks salvation in him.. giving unto them a new and beautiful life with him as a born again child of God. I would love to see each and every single person on this earth receive salvation and so I spread the good news in hopes that I can get as many people to repent and receive Christ before his second coming. I pray that who ever reads this considers a life in Christ and repents from the wickedness of this world before it's too late. Jesus loves you and so do I <3 Be blessed my loves<\3
Please do a part 2
I miss christain
I literally cried when Vanessa and John walked out with their dinner outfit 😂😂😂😂😂
Haha Roni and Aaron are “normal” people watching youtubers go on dates. 😂
I would LOVE to see you two switch spots, it would be interesting to see how it would go for you and your dates.❤️😅
Idk roni and aaron seemed more grateful for their time together. Nessa and her bf were straight faced and looked bored🤷🏻‍♀️
Wait nessa got a mans?

Not them planning there videos around dates without the guys knowing first 😭imagine they said no 😂

Ron Ron's date was the cutest 🥰. They enjoyed each other's company and that is just showed how important it is to know each other well enough to have a great time even without money.  But I am looking forward to switching sides too lol. Cause I wanna know if Nessa and John can do $10 date
John to Vanessa: you look like a greek goddess  Meanwhile Aaron and ronni: I DREW A RAINBOW
Aaron and ronni= realtionship goals
SWITCH ROLES!!
They both had fun with their dates but I think ronron's date was cute :"> but nessa and john's date felt chill 💗
You should do a part 2! I think Aaron and roni deserve a nice expensive date after the rough past month Aaron has had💗
No offence but there is a weird a vibe between vanessa and Jhon
l agradeço muito a facilidade na tradução  nem ligo o tradutor mais para traduzir o nome do video ,Vanessa e Veronica  Merrell ficaram lindos como de costume ,e tambem mando um abraço apertado para todos que participaram deste video
switchh !
YES PLEASE DO A PART 2!
John is really funny. Like he doesn't speak unless it is something mindblowing🤣
"a V and an A, V plus A. it could VA" -ronnie 2021
OMG switch the budgets and show us how the date would go then!!...loved this vid
John sure doesn’t give much reaction lol 😝
Arron: “How did you get a Porsche for 10 dollars?!”
prefiro  deixar os comentários artistico para profissionais da area
Personally if I got the $10 date I wouldn’t spend it on a new outfit. I would only use it for food, and go somewhere beautiful for free
13:39  roni: aaron, your pants aaron: fashion statement roni: no aaron! that is not a fashion statement  this was too funny to me XD
Why did John get a butterfly tattoo???
This exact date but ness n John get 10 dollar s
I had a blast watching this.😂💜
Nessa and John 🤩🤩🤩 Roni and Aaron both dates were absolutely perfect 🤩🤩🤩🤩
Yessss please do a part 2!!!!

I’d say do another video where you switch! Gives you guys both perspectives!!

I laughed way too hard at when Roni broke the thing for the cHalk 💀
You know he's the one when he says you look like a greek godess
Plz part 2
OK I’m not gonna lie to you but I enjoyed watching Roni and Aaron‘s date. It just proves that you don’t need to have a lot of money to have fun.   P.S Nessa and John you are so cute together
Definitely do the swap please
Ronron looked like little kid left behin while their parents go out on a date at 15:05

Part 2
Part 2
Part 2
You guys really should do a part 2
Both sisters taken!! Lucky guys!
Roni and Nessa should act sick for a day to see how John and Aaron react and care for them. It would be really cute to watch. Copy and paste into the comment section/dm them if you like the idea. I really want to see a video like that I feel like they would have really cute reactions ❤️
riding the helicopter? English is a weird language
Vanessa looks like she’s glowing. Girl send the beauty routine
I loved Aaron and Roni's date! They are so cute and just shows if you are with someone you care about and have fun with you don't need stupid amounts of money.  Would be really cool to see the date prices reversed though, I don't think Nessa could do better the Roni for $10 😆
part 2 pleaseeee
Both dates looked dope.
You guys should so switch
Nessa and josh's date was fancy but it wasn't cute as Roni and Aarons date
I wanna see this video but switched so that next time Nessa gets $10 and Roni $10000. love you guys sm! ❤️ You make my day better!!!!
YES DO THE SWITCH NEXT WEEK
RONI AND AARON ARE SO CUUUUUUUUUTE
i think john is kind of a introverted or ambiverted  person or he is camera shy haha he doesnt talk much
Hahahaha 13:28 I love them 🤣😂
SWITCH SWITCH SWITCH PLEASE ✨  Btw, I love John’s side remarks!! Esp saying those things with a straight face 😂
Roni looks so cute am I right? If yes drop a like
Yes do a part 2
Roni and aaron's date was my favorite.😂
Hi I think that jou should switch up an Ron Ron gets   $10 000 and jonessa should have $10
shoutout to jose. he's a real one
Do not worry Roni your date was cool to I loved it❤️
I think both ones were great, one was made from love and the other was made from money 😂
Part 2 pleaseee
dreamers !
OMG YESSS please do a part 2!! this was great!!!!
The only thing I could think of was that the $10 date fit RonRon SOOOO FREAKING MUCH
How about ten dollars each😊
BROOOO. I NEED TO SEE THAT RON-RON SPENT $10,000 AND NESSA-JOHN SPEN T $10
Switch!! please✨✨
Yall shoud switch
tbh I would take roni and aaron's date it seems more fun and creative but both dates were nice
roni and Aaron's date was awesome and so cute!!!
Please do a part 2 and switch places
Yesssssssss switch
I want a $10 date 🙃💔
10 dollar are enough and you can really enjoy.If you are with someone you really love or he/she loves you. There's a very strong bond of friendship between Roni and Aron.That is why I think they really enjoyed it.I don't why but I also enjoyed watching there date.
why is dis trending its almost as stupid as it is fake. staged.
I’m obsessed with roni and Aaron and how much fun they had with what little they were given. Goes to show they only need each other to have a good time💜
This is the best hahaha
Switch, switch, switch !!!
when are you guys going to do merrell twins exposed
Nessa's boyfriend doesnt seem to be into videos and seems hes just obliging. 9:37
They should switch the amount of money to see what they would do
You guys must do a part 2 🔄
Me when I heard they will be going on a helicopter  ... why did you rent the porsche then?
When Roni broke the chalk machine when opening it 😂😂😂😂 best duo Aaron and Roni🥰🤞🏽
Roni and Aaron's outfits be ending models carreers
Yes please next time switch Also keep going with those challenges they’re the best❤️❤️❤️
I am also a twin
I am subscribed and post notifications are on
Aaron and roni was coolll
I truly think roni and Aarons date was cuter 😂
This is so wholesome awe
toni & aaron’s date was the cutest, liked it better than nessas & whatever his name is
You guys should definitely do a part 2. Love your guy's videos btw
DO A PART 2...WHERE U SWITCH THE ROLES. it would be really fun to watch...and I love nessa's last outfit. It was gorgeous....I'm that both of them had fun...if they both are happy. That makes me more happy. I just wish Jhone and nessa be together forever. They r sweetest couple😁😄👍
I dont know about john nessa
the ten dollar date seemed more fun in my opinion
I think Roni and Aaron won they had the best time! It was so cute.
How about do a "date-off" where you do a challenge to see who can do/plan the best date for $20/50 (20 if each pair plans for the other pair, or 50 if each pair plans a double date)
I have a feeling that if Nessa got the 10 dollars , she would have been MISERABLE. 🤣🤣
YESSS PLEASEEE SWITCHHH! I WONDER HOW IT WILL TURN OUTT 🤣🤣🤣
Both of these dates are cool in their own way, I love it! You can always make a difficult situation fun depending on how you handle it!
I’d love to see a video of you guys switching the dates around 😊
buy one get one big macs let’s get it
GTA 😳😳
i cant stop laughing at every ronron moment😂like it's amazing i cant even
NOBODY CARES
Yes please do one where y’all switch !!
I rlly ship Aaron and roni they're so cute together
Yes part 2 switch please!!
Ngl, I would enjoy both date 😂 buuuut something about Roni's date makes it more special in a way that you don't need much to have fun
Both couples look like they really enjoyed their dates. I feel like these dates brought them even closer. Besides they were both funny too.  John and Aaron are straight up comedians lol
Funny how these dates matched up with your personalities 😂
Yesssss switch i want to see what roni would do with the date if she had 10 thousand and then what Vanessa would do with 10
At 14:38 literally cracked me up seeing their faces. 😂
Roni and Aarons date was 10x better not even gone cap . It's not all about the fancy stuff . it's about the person ❤️
You guys should switch definitely for real‘s
Jose was so  nice <333
This was such a good video…as usual.
YESSS I need a part two!!!
SWITCH SWITCH SWITCH!!!!!  y'all too cute  😍
switch the amounts
I was smiling the whole time!  Please make a reverse video!
PLEASE DO A PART 2!!
That money could have helped with my college tuition 🥺🥺
You guys should switch
10$ date: *literally spends it on just a little gas*
Okay, this was adorable, and to be honest, I would love to go on either of those dates! I think the ten dollar one is all about having fun, being silly, and enjoying each other's company, and the ten thousand dollar one is one to have fun too, but in a more serious and romantic way (which is still great! It's a good way to get to know each other. Since you're not going to be fancy every day, it's fun to see how each person reacts when they do get the opportunity to be fancy :) ). I think they're both memory makers for sure, and you'll be able to look back on each of them fondly, whether it's for the experience of riding a helicopter or the experience of riding a kiddie carousel for fifty cents! To be honest, I would love to see this video again, but with the amounts of money switched, just to see what you guys would do!
Please make part 2!
Oh my goodness Roni praying before they ate was the sweetest thing ever I love them
Aaron and Roni are so sweet I love that they were just having fun with each other even though they got the cheap date
Roni and Aaron's date is so adorable
Yess switch !
OH MY GOD!!!!! I am not used to all of this RonRon content! But at the same time...I am living for it!!!
Am I the only one that burst out laughing when John and Vanessa drove off in their cool car, wearing fancy outfits, while Aaron and Veronica just stood there watching in their thrift store outfits.
This is the best video of you ever
You guys should def do this video again but switch and have the guys pick the dates!

I love the goofy side in nessa and aaron
I really like John!! He seems so down to earth and genuine. Glad Nessa found someone who makes her happy!
Part 2 swap
🤣🤣🤣🤣 how could you get a Porsche for 10 dollars 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I can’t stop laughing
OMG WE NEED A P2
Roni and Aaron won hands down. 😁
I’m glad RonRon got the $10 date. They're simple people and I knew they could make the most out of it!
I love how roni and Aaron can be sooo happy with only 10 bucks
13:50 Nessa’s face is so shocked on seeing their clothes 😂😭
I love José he’s so nice
I would love to see the roles switched, I reallyy hope they make a part 2 !!!
It just shows goes that you can be happy without money 💵
Part 2 pleaseeee!! Switch version HAHAHAHA😆
You should do a video swapping the dates Roni-$10,000 Nessa-$10
Veronica: let’s get to chalking   Please do a part two
part 2 AF!!!!
When Roni and Aron went on the carousel, OMG I haven't laughed that much in a good old while hahaha. :)
The $10 date would be fire with my bestie
14:54 wait why does this look AMAZING
Yereeeeeessss
awww! did anyone else find it adorable that Roni and Aaron prayed before their meal?
Roni and Aaron are so cute and relationship goals. 🔥
I love how Aaron is not willing to believe that the Porsche isn't for their date 藍
NEED A PART TWO!!
Why wasnt john excited when roni announced the helicopter ride 😭
You guys should do part 2 of this video! I loved the part where Aaron did with his clothes as a "fashion statement"!😂
i think yall should switch rolls :) I think it would be cool
Please do a part 2! Would love to see what Nessa plans with $10 and what Roni does with $10,000. :) this is one of my favorite videos yall have done!
I loved both their dates but Aaron and Roni's date was more fun while John and Nessa's was more sophisticated and bougie but still great, I would love to see a part 2 where they both switch that would be cool.
Honestly, Aaron and Roni’s date; any day. 🥰
I loved this video! I think it would be fun to see the roles reversed too!!❤️
Roni and Aaron have the cutest relationship dynamic!! It's so sweet being able to look and act stupid with your partner and still having so much fun together :))
John’s butterfly tattoo👀👀👀 Vanessa=🦋
I wish this was more normalized. I loved how they did this. Your gender shouldn’t even matter at all. I really hate gender roles and society expectations so much. Also love how it shows that both ways can be fun. ☺️
WHO'S JOHN!!!!!??
1000
Yeeees, switch? It would be fair 🥺 Ly 💖
switch the rolessssssssssssssssssssss pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeee i need john vaughn in another video of yoursssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss pleeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaassssssssssssseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
14:51 leave the jokes and puns to your girlfriend, okay, pal? 🙄
Roni disinfecting herself is me everytime I get back home after going out 😂🙌
V+A= VAH 😂😂😂😂😂
Idk but sometimes my dates are more like RONRON so......RonRon won my vote
12:44 where i get my energy drinks from. YUMMY!!!! 😁💕
„I like green“  „That’s cause it’s the color of money“ 😂😂😂
Yes yes switch! I love your videos so much.❤😊
„He was like come over and we were like nooo..he was like be in my next movie and we were like noo“ that was hilarious 😂😂
11:21 in the words of the great Steven Tyler, "Dude look like a lady". 🤣
I love that video idea but now you need to make another one where you guys switch😂💙💙
PLS MAKE A PART 2 😭
I wanna see roni have 10k and nessa $10 😂
The whole premise of money over happiness is a real thing, especially in LA.  But the thrills go away quickly and the fun Roni & Aaron had will be everlasting.  The real thrill is being with the one you love no matter what your doing.
18:06 😤 stinkin cute!
had anyone noticed john's reaction when he and nessa said "okay" the same time???
so this squad got to need to got to have a name.
Hiii
awww but you guys should do a part 2 with switchin the moneyyy
Love it lol
love it how roni and aaron pray before eating 🥺 love it!
You guyzz should switch.. It's gonna be fun😆
I think that you guys should TOTALLY do a part 2!!!!! Ronnie should DEFINITELY go on a &10,000 date with Aaron; Nessa should go on a $10 date!!!!! 🤩🤩🤩
The way Jonh said okay was like " Nessa idk what you are doing but I am worried and scared"
Switch switch 😍😍😍😍😍
Welcome to Los Santos! :)
10,000 date but yall shoude meck part too so yay
The amount things you could have done for a $10k date is immense and that was underwhelming 😂😂😂
John sounds depressed
Literally always shipping RonRon for life 😍❤️
Do the switched video 🙌
P.2 plz where you guys switch
Nessas boyfriend is just boring 😴😒🙄...I miss alex🥺🥺🥺🥺
Love RonRon, having fun with the one you love!💜❤🌹 Fun outfits! "Let's get to chalking!"
Switch
Can someone let Roni know it’s okay to call Aaron her boyfriend on camera 🤣
SWITCH 💜💜💜💜
YES PLEASE MAKE A PART 2
Yes we need a switch up
Please do this again but other way. 10 dollar date for Nessa and Roni gets the 10,000😍😂
I think you guys should switch and do another video with Vanessa doing a ten dollar date and Veronica doing the 10000 one
Money isn’t for everything
Please do a part 2
I love the fact that Aaron is just like Roni💗 CUTEST COUPLE🥺🤍
Yessssss!!!!!!dooooo switchhhh

Roni and aaron roaming around town in thrift clothes with tags on.....ICONIC.
Please do the part 2 and switch the roles !!!🙂💓
Bless jose
This really shows that money can’t buy happiness because Roni and Arron had so much fun with out a lot of money
Love it! Especially love the $10 date. I wanna try this now ☺️ can we have them swap next week so Nessa has $10 and Roni has 10k!
My opinion: of course you would always prefer 10.000$ date but like Aaron and Ronis date look so funny and like real love if u get me❤️ good video guys
Yessss you guys should do a part 2 of both of you switching
This is great but you should go back to Jose and give him the amount he discounted from the clothes for the date
John is such a mood “we need money to be happy” yea same💀💀💀😭😭😭😭
Roni and Aaron was amazing and lovely to see them together ❤, they just having fun and enjoying, so cute 😍
Yess part -2...  Plz
So sad only 10 dollars
That was so cute!!!
YES a part two pleeeease!!!
Nessa got 1000 dollars .why did you guys write 10,000 dollars in the title .
Ive seen the pics on IG. John & Nessa looked like they were going to a movie premiere.
''And Thanks for watching'', Veronica and Nessa said. I say ''Thanks for making!''
I think Aaron and roni's theme is like the broke date👌 And I think John and nessa's theme is like the boujee ✨
I think for me it doesnt matter if my date is cheap or not. What matters to me most is the one that i am spending my time and day with!☺️
The difference between the guys in how comfortable they are with the vlog camera is so cute😂😍
roni and arron is the cutest.not being rude or hateful but nessa's behaviour kinda lost my love for her in this video.
Switch places !!!
yo but fr if i had to choose which date to go on i would go on roni and aarons date IT LOOKED SO FUN!!!!
“ you know what that means we have 50cents left”  “I know exactly what that means” The next clip had me rolling on the floor for like 10 minutes  You guys never fail to make me laugh. Making everyone’s Tuesday’s better ❤️
I feel like the $10k date would be so much harder to plan then the $10 date 😂 lol but then again I’m poor and thoroughly enjoy finding fun, cheap/free things to do, while I find it physically painful when I have to spend large amounts of money. 🤣🤣
RONRON SUPERIOR!!!
Yes!!! Switch!!
I think you guys should do a part to two roni should get the 10,000 and nessa should get the 10 dollar   This is the best vlog actually thank you merrell twins for making these video we appreciate this Thank you!
I had lot of fun watching both of you especially Ron Ron ❤️❤️❤️

RonRon acting normal is just so cute. 🥺❤️
1000 bills are a thing
Switch switch switch ❤️❤️
lmao nessa actually claims her boyfriend
I watched an edit of extreme cheapskates and the way how Roni and Aaron spends the 10 dollars remind me of extreme cheapskates
Of course Nessa gets the 10k 🤣 i feel like if ronron were to get it they’ll spend it in ridiculous ways too
Morgz  started it not  Lexi
both dates were awesome, but I go with team RonRon They only spent 10 dollars and made the best of it I also like the other date BOTH WERE GREAT TEAM RONRON!!❤️❤️
U dont need a lot of money to have a good time
I think 10 dollars date was better because money can't buy happiness
Definitely do part 2
tbh the 10 dollar one looked more fun
roni and aaron waving nessa and john as they drove away was so fricking funny i dont know why i laughed as much as i did lmao
PLEEEASE SWITCH!!!! <3
I kinda feel like the dates worked out really well for both sides, like it kinda fit them better
Yeah you should definitely do a second part of this challenge where nessa and john will get 10 dollars and then roni and aaron will get 10 thousand dollars, love you lots!!:)
I liked roni and aarons the best, and it was more of a challenge! Sooo yaaas pls swap and do it again!
PLS DO THE PART 2 SWITCH I'M CURIOUS ABOUT HOW IT'S GONNA GO
We need a part 2, but let's switch it this time. Roni will have the $10,000 date and Nessa for the $10 date. It will be so much fun, I know for sure. 🤣

House Tour !!!!!!!!!!!!
This one was so fun to watch. Part 2 will be even funnier to watch
who here also watched lexi rivera's video of $10 date vs $10 000 date
I think roni's date is Better

Someone needs to tell Veronica face the jello is good lol
John and Nessa looked so good tho
* Nessa talking how how her date was……** *roni- 😒😑😵‍💫* lolll
I love you so much
😂
Are you coming out with new merch soon???
Do the switch :)
these two are one of the most  genuine people on the whole internet!!
Aaron: we rode a carousel  John: how much was that Aaron and Roni: 50 cents 😎😎  14:21
Please do a part 2 but switch
The irony that the $10 date looked the most fun lol The $10,000 date was cute and romantic, but it's just something about the silliness of Roni and Aaron's date that made me want to try for myself. Love you both! Please do a part 2 and switch!
Love the merrell twins forever    Big fan girl-
Poor Aaron just wanted to ride on the Porche haha
we need to open it up *snaps* looks at camera @17:10 has me cackling, also the changeovers between the 2 dates are soo funny
Aaron “it’s a fashion statement” I LOVE IT 😂😂😂😂😂
Nessa roni you guys are the best twins ever even if I Hava a twin sis
if you involve money with love, money will always be the topic.  you will know love when it happens & not a set-up youtube vide about dating
Whoa, that was weird hearing John say Nessa's (Vanessa) name because everyone including Roni calls her by her nickname. Nothing bad just different.
Yes
Ronron’s date was so wholesome. I loved when Roni took the time to pray before their meal
Roni spraying herself with Lysol cracked me up
Roni and aarons date was so much fun ❤❤love you gise so much❤❤
john has a great jawline 😭
Both dates seemed really fun but honestly you had me at the thrift store. That dress though..very flattering👌😂
IDK WHY BUT RONIS ORANGE HAT MADE THE ENTIRE VIDEO LIKE 10X FUNNIER LMAOOOO
Switch and Part 2!!!!!
The $10 date honestly looks way more fun
we need part 2!!!❤️❤️ love from Malaysia 😘😘
I was hoping roni would tell nessa what they did all day. It would have been funny 😂
The way Nessa aww'd when Roni said she and Aaron got closer. So supportive
I LOVE YOU GUYS I WISH I COULD MEET YOU IN PERSON
Tell me you're rich without telling me you're rich, the short film🍿🎬🎥 😂
SWITCHHHHHHHHHH
Oh Aaron and John are very different I'm talkin about their personalities
Definitely swap!
Should of tipped Jose man!!
I know where that thrift store is at!!! I go there too
SWITCH!! 🥺😍
Switchhhhhh
Aaron's reaction was EVERYTHING
Jose  was so cool.
RONI WAS SOOOOOOOOO FREAKING FUNNY IN THIS. I COULDNT STOP LAUGHING!!! PLEASE MAKE A PART TWO AND MAKE NESSA SUFFER HAHAHAHAHAHAH
Is Aaron growing a mustache or?
part 2 is definately needed! Love you guys
Roni: We get the quarters! Aaron: You know what that means? Me: Bubblegum machine... Next clip: Ronron on the merry-go-round 😂
WIW SHoving cameras in the middle of a date how realistic is that omg
Petition for them to switch places. Roni and Aaron do the $10,000 and Vanessa and John to do the $10 date. I want to see what differences there would be😂💞
That was a sweet prayer :)
PART 2 pleaseeeee
yes you should do part2!!! love you guys
these two couples are so perfect in their own ways awwww
Do a part 2 . that would be amazing. i wanna see roni with 10 thousand dollars .❤love u guys
There should definitely be the video where roni spends $10K and nessa $10
the 10 dollar date was more authentic  and fun
yes!! you guys should swap. It will be fun.
I honestly think Roni and Aaron's date seemed like so much fun. Both dates had an equal amount of energy and they all ended up feeling closer and bonded through both dates. Money is not everything but it's some things in life where money CAN be fundamental for certain things. Still for a date these both seemed really fun 😁 Love watching you two every Tuesday and seeing you guys grow together 💕
YES PLEASE SWITCH!!!
roni and aaron had 10 dollars but there date was very fun personally seeing it then nessa and her bf  but both were nicee
I know Venessa enjoyed her date, but I thoroughly enjoyed Roni and Aarons date more! Something about it just seemed so pure and enduring. Pls do a part 2 with the roles reversed.
hooray for breaking the norm Roni
Yes!! You guys should switch and do another video like this
The bachelorette date night!
Wait, nessa have a BOYFRIEND?!
when roni broke the chalk pen holder I LOST IT🤣🤣
Reverse plssssss
Both dates seemed so fun I can’t choose what one I like better. You guys are both very cute together
Yes do part 2
17:00 the cutest thing I've ever seen
Roni looks beautiful  😍 and love Nessa hair here 😘😘😘 it suits her really well
wasted 10,000  date     I could've had many many many dates for $10,000 all ending ,,,          with very  happy endings
I like roni and Aaron's date. So fun
i wonder what will happen if they switch oop
I love Roni and Aron's date😍 It looks so much Fun. I would love to see a part 2 where Roni gets the 10 000$
I would love to see a part 2 when you guys swap!!!!
Switch! 😃
definitely need a part 2!! need to see what roni and aaron could do on an expensive date!
Give me 1 date with Vanessa and no money she would fall in love with me and have a better experience... No cap
Just my opinion, but I find the $10 date more fun to watch because it is interesting to see how they spend the $10.  With the $10,000 date, since it is a lot of money, there usually isn't much creativity with it.  But yes, I would like to see another video with the roles reversed.
we need part 2
You guys shout try it one more time and switch the $10 Date and $10,000 Date!! It'll be so much fun!!!..
Yes pls for part 2 and switching it up!
Rewatching this cuz 🤷🏾‍♀️ and like I just keep on awwing at ronron’s relationship like they are so sweet
He only with Vanessa for money wow he needs money to be happy i would only need her to be happy
Yeah switch
Awww poor roni 🥺🥺🥺 but I love you girls both ❤️❤️❤️
Aaron and Roni look adorable together when they were drawing with chalk
Vanessa looks so different like the olden days kids
We want the switch video too. It will be very fun I loved this videoooo❤️❤️
Dude ronron is so adorable, they are like a little oldie couple but nessa and john are cute too. Also please do the switch thing too, it would be cool to see.
Plss do part 2
It's Aaron and Roni's faces when John and Nessa drove away in the Porsche for me.
Honestly I would be content with the $10 date
Yeah,,,Switch roles and make part 2....😀
15:01 ,can't stop laughing😂😂😂
I loved how they enjoyed their individual dates. I would like to see them switch the  money in their next video
Hahahahahah Aaron’s dress
What happened to Nessa and Christan?
Part 2!
Do the reversal
The odyseyy‼️⁉️ 😵 . 5 minutes away from my home. 😭😍  ..
I want to see what Vanessa would have done with $10
y'all have to switch and roni gets the $10,000 date and nessa gets the $10!! this video was hilarious!! ronron's date was my fav for sure!!  :)
Two a part two
Switch roles !!! Would like to see how it turns out 🤩
Yes switch it would be fun too see what roni choose for 10,000 date and nessa comes up with for the 10
Yeah I want part 2!!!
they got it wrong. it was Lexi Hensler who did it
switch pleaaaseeeee🥺🥺👉👈
Love this video I’ve been waiting for you guys to do something like this and I have you vvm white T-shirt by the way love you guys sooo much bye!!!!!
I love this video so much; I'm already on my second time watching it. Roni's face when she breaks the chalk holder LOL xD xD
Aarons reaction to seeing the Porche was so funny (sorry I don't know how to spell Porche), and when he mentioned it Roni's face was priceless
roni and aarons's date seems more to laugh with, and vanessa and john's date seemed very elegant and peaceful rich people stuff
Do it
Well atleast they learned how make the best from the worst
This video’s hilarious 😂  PART 2 SWITCH ROLES PLS
Part 2 please
I WAS ABOUT TO COMMENT THAT HOPEFULLY THERE'S A PART TWO BAT SWITCH AND THEN YOU GUYS SAID IT NOWWWWWW. PLEASE FOR PART 2
i personally would love to see you both swap roles with the amount of money
wow I'm kinda jealous y'all got to go on a date with y'all boyfriends. I haven't seen my boyfriend over a year an I can't see him till he gets his covid vaccine. I really wish I could of have that money to take out my boyfriend be nice just to be on a weekend date I really miss my boo so much 😞😢😢
Please do a part 2!!!
plsss do a part 2
Roni carried the date so well...
yea  i love it
Roni and Aaron are our relationships everyday and Nessa and John are our relationships 10 years later... If successful 😂
We definitely need a part 2!
Ronni and Aaron could have went to the Getty for free!!! That museum is amaaaaaaazing, and would be perfect for a couple! :D I still really liked Ronron's day though, it was so cute and wholesome and just perfect <3
Venessa def deserves the expensive date ❤️
I think they should do a part two but have roni and araon do the $10,000 date and Vanessa and John do the $10 date and see how each one does each differently but with the same amount I think it would be a really cool video slash like mini series
its so funny 😭😭😭😭😭
Omg this video was so funny 😆 I would love to see them switch the 10 dollars and 10,000 dollars because I want to see what nessa would do with 10$ and vice versa
part twoooo! would love to see what would you guys do if it's the other way around
I def think y’all should switch the money, it would be interesting to see how Roni and Aaron spend $10,000
Why are they hating on Aaron wearing the dress man … we love a fashion statement and breaking gender barriers 😂❤️❤️
You guys are so cute love you ♥️♥️♥️♥️💕💕💕💕💕💕💕♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️💜💜💖💖💜💜💜♥️💕
Wait what!?!? Your boyfriend is John!?!? Isn't Christian?!?!?
Should definitely do a part two
Part 2 with switched roles 🤭
Ronron should get a chance at a 10,000 dollar date ☺️ .
parttt 222222222222
Honestly I feel like Roni was having a better time than Nessa
I like Ronis date idea. But I wonder what she would’ve done with the 10,000$ on a date
When the chalk thing broke HAHAHAHAH, Roni and Aarons face though🥲
Roni: "We don't need $10,000 to have fun. John: “Well we need money to be happy” Lmao did this get anyone laughing
WHITE PRIVILEGED
NOBODY CARES
this is like when 2 children go on a date vs 2 rich adults imma be honest I want the outfits from both  and I would much rather go on the $10 date
yesss switch
when they said "we saw Lexi Rivera" i was like shocked idk why i mean many youtubers done that but when i just know the youtuber im just shocked
Yessss switch and do a part 2 🙌🏻☺️
we need a pt.2 where u switch!!
i honestly loved aaron’s and roni date cause it was so genuine
Loved it 💯💯💯
Yes switch the dates! I’d love to see what you guys come up with! Roni and aaron’s date was so cute!
The way john casually responds each time nessa says something exciting cracks me up every time
So this is what happens when both of them are taken😂😂😂
He could glue some white leaves on the dress and be lilo from lilo and stitch for Halloween !!!
Yes pt 2!!! Would love to see how you use the other amount of money!
You guys definitely have to make a part 2 with the roles switched! Really looking forward to it!!!! Love Love!❤️
Yes please do a video where you switch date costs
SWITCH!!!!
Yes I definitely think you guys should do a switch video where Roni & Aaron has a $10,000 date & Nissan & John have a $10 date. To see what different ideas you girls can come up with
YES SWITCH PLS PART 2
When they were arguing about who should go first, and roni said: breaking gender barriers Like yesss🙌🏼😂
This was my favorite video by far 😂
Both were great but I'd do Roni and Aaron's date!
Plz part 2 😊❤️
YES WE NEED PART 2!!! 🥰
Definitely want to see a part 2!
Roni and Aaron watching Nessa and John driving away be like: 🧍🧍‍♀️
PART 2 PLZZ!!!❤️
john is incredibly unenthusiastic and seems disinterested :/
Roni n Aaron made me laugh so bad 😂
Definitely switch !
posted on my birthday! glad y'all were here for me practically my whole birthday I was by myself so glad merrell twins are here for me
This was so funny and fun to watch 🤣❤
Ronron should do the 10,000 date next time.
I love john's humor lmao
I'm crying 🤣🤣🤣 17:08
Love your vids very entertaining 🥰
I lovEeedddd Veronica‘s date 💀 it wASS SOOO CUTE
Aaron: Fashion statement Me: 🤣🤣🤣  13:41
Love your videos so so much🙃🌻!! They're so fun and goofy to watch and they're always entertaining
I will like to see what would Vanessa does with $10 and Veronica with 10,000 and see what they would do
To be honest i like roni then vanessa. I HATE VANESSA'S STYLE I LIKE RONI'S MORE
I think this is definitely one of my favorite video these girls made and I would love to see a part 2!😍🤩
PART TWO SWITCH YES
14:44   nessa's laugh tho HAHA
Lol Porsche for $10 🤣
YOU SHOULD DO IT AGAIN
Both date was great. I think you should switch it ❤️
Now Veronica and Aaron should get the $10,000 and John and Vanessa get the $10 to make it fair
The helicopter ride with Vanessa and John gave me a flashback from Bailey McKnight & Asa Howard's wedding last Friday when they flew off in a helicopter that night. 💍💍💍💍
i thinki would rather roni's and Arons date cuz it looks really fun and it shows that you dont need money to have fun
PAST 2 PLEASE! SWITCH SWITCH SWITCH YEYYYY
most definitely would’ve gone on aaron & roni date
This was sooooooooooo funny u guys should do this again but switch who has the money, it would probably be halarious
Please make a video switching . Ronnie should get 10,000 to spend with Aaron . Vanessa should get 10 to spend with her boyfriend.
It ain’t real if it’s not the $10 one lol
I genuinely like Aaron and Roni’s date more. They actually had fun together 🥰
I kinda actually loved Aarons and Veronicas date it was so cool and fun and you guys didn't have to be serious and had fun I would definitely have a $10 date
Why is nessa so 😃 and her bf is just 😒.
I love Roni and Aaron’s relationship
moral about this video is even tho' you don't have alot of money. if you're contented with each other. you'll have a lot of fun together ❤ even also you have alot of money. loveyahhhhh both!
SWITCH
Ok a deep review coming up:  RonRon's date showed that money would never break them apart and they'd always have fun as long as they have each other. Whereas, the $10,000 date shows that someone needs money to be happy and not simply enjoying the other person's presence and company. Which would cause a lot of issues and boredom in a relationship if money ever became a problem.
Roni: "We don't need $10,000 to have fun. John: “Well we need money to be happy” Lmao did this get anyone laughing
I love y’all! Y’all should make another video where y’all swap who has the 10 dollar date and the 10,000 dollar date!
Wait are Roni and Aaron dating?!
Now they need to switch to see how The others do like that would be interesting to see
I think both were great dates 👍👍👍👍
It should’ve been $50 or $500
I swear nessa has been glowing since she got into this relationship I’m so happy for her and she looked stunning in the outfits
Yes you should switch!!!
Y'all should switch money amounts and do a part 2!!! It would be cool to see what each of you come up with now that you experienced one of the 2 dates :)
Their green outfitssss 💚🖤💚 I kinda want the dress
Yes switch
i think you guys should switch, im so exited what roni and aaron will do with 10k
Part 2
Yes pleas part 2🥰
Yessss part two pls! Love you guys
yesss doo itt
Roni and Aaron had me crying from laughing so hard  LMAO
I think you guys should totally do that!
THE WAY SHE SNAPPED IT
Part 2!!!
PLEASE SWITCH !!!!!!!!
Yes switch!! Please
15:00 they look like children being left at home while their parents go out on a date😂😂
Why does messages look older lol
Because of RonRon's outfits they looked like characters from The Sims 😂
Yes part 2!!!!
Omg Jose from the thrift shop is such a kind soul
Money doesn’t buy happiness
Roni and aaron having fun and silly date while nessa and john having mature date but its both amazing date
Part 2 please! Ron Ron on $10,000 date and Nessa and John on $10 date.
Yes, please do the date where Roni has the 10,000 and Nessa has the 10!!
wait. this is prom knight but opposite twins......
You should switch 💜💖
I think Roni should do the $10000 date in the next video
do a part 2! would love to see how ronron will spend 10,000
Part 2!!
both nessa and roni asking their bf’s on a date is so cute,
PART 2 PLSSS!! I think ronron must experience the $10,000 date😆 they wouldn't know where to spend that money HAHA i wonder what nessa and john would do with $10😂
Yall are so awesome
The symbiosis never gets old ❤❤❤
Yyyeeesss pleeeease! Do a part 2!!!! I would love to see RonRon get spoiled too 😂😂😂 they’re so funny lol
To be honest i think Roni and Aaron date was the best 😇 even tho in a 10 dollar budget i just think they have the best date. And if i was Nessa i Will take Roni and Aaron on a date it Will be fun double date. I agree part two and Roni and Aaron do a  10 thousand dollar .
Yes please switch!!!!!
That thrift store deserved a shout out. What a guy!
Love you guys
Yes switch !!
We need Part 2!!!!!This was so much fun. RonRon also deserve rich date while John and Nessa should also do RonRon's date to get more closer and closer❤️❤️😍
Aaron and Roni were cracking me up the whole time. I think y’all should definitely switch roles!!
I would not mind a $10 date it looks like fun and you could really enjoy the time kind of thing but a $10,000 date would be cool
15:01 lol aaron and roni look like children saying bye to their parents
John is so funny i want him on the channel more!
is ron ron real??
We need Part 2!! It would definitely be entertaining and funny to see how each of y'all would do the opposite kind of date!! PART 2 PLEASE!!!! :)
Lesson learned. Money can’t buy happiness. You can be rich but not happy. God Bless you all.
Aaron: So where using the Porsche for the date   Roni: we didn’t get the 10,000 dollars for the date  Aaron: than what are we…  Aaron: stares at the car not paying attention  Roni : we got the 10 dollar date Aaron  Roni: talking to the camera  Aaron: how did get a Porsche for 10 dollars  Roni: No Aaron I didn’t do that “laughing”  Aaron: oh 😞🙁 Me: dying of laughter poor Aaron he was so excited cause of the Porsche lmaoooo

The carousel was hysterical.
SWITCH!
Would love to see the swap!
Lmaoo John dosent like happy at all 🙄🙄
Nessa's date was definitely an amazing experience. But Roni's date was more fun. It shows that a great date is all about the company and who you spend time with
Honestly Roni and Aaron’s date was the cutest thing ever!!! 😂🥰
i would love a part 2!!!!
they should do this challenge again but switch it
RonRon also deserve a $10,000 date
Ya do a part 2

14:46 nessa fake laughing 😭😭
Does anyone know where to rent out cars like that for a day??
I wish if you guys do the opposite next week. I want Roni to get a great day too because she deserves it too .
I would vs $10K in a cage right now
“This is one of our…my favorite dates”  Lol I think he was going to say this is one of our best dates 😍 Ronron for the win!
Nessa and John are practically acting like adults while Roni and Aaron are going back to there childhood 😂 😂
Everyone knows that you don't need a lot of money to have a great day/date. Roni and Aaron proved that in this video.  Part 2 has to happen!! ❤️😂
Tbh I think Ronron date was more fun
Aaron is HILARIOUS 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
When you're materialistic...🤦‍♂️🤣
YES YALL SHOULD SWITCH!!!!!
This was so FUN to watch! I think I'd enjoy either dates to be honest lol I'd love to see a part 2 pleeeaseee 💖💖💖
Roni and Arron are to cuteeee😭😭😭
Ok but Roni and Aarons date is what my dates would be like all the time 💀💀💀
Part 2 pleasee
Yessss part 2!!! Please I would want to see what y’all would do differently
I like how John was just like “wow so cool I’ve never been in a helicopter..” and Aaron was like “OMG RONI THIS IS THE BEST DATE EVER!!!
Johns hella funny
Y’all should definitely switch it up
I love both of their relationships. John suits Nessa so well and Aaron suits Roni so well. I can't get over how precious Ronron is.  ♡
10,000 or 1,000? No shade, just curious. I'm getting 1,000 for ten 100s.
Definitely do a part two!
I love y’all so much and I’m so happy for you nessa because she found a true boyfriend
i would love to see part TWO !!!!
Yes that would be fun to see what you both can do with the other amount  Im laughing so much
Hi I'm 11year old girl  I love u guys so much  You make my day so great every time I'm sad
Wait I am obsessed with John he’s really funny and genuine, so happy for you two being in such wonderful relationships 💞💞💞
this video was so much fun! You guys should do it again but reversed! would like to see what you guys would do :)) <3
aww i kinda felt bad for Aaron when he thought they got the expensive date lol
PART 2 !!!
ok but Roni and Aarons date looked pretty fun
Switch
I should make a velocity edit of Nessa entering that car, she literally looked like a goddess
I watched Lexi Rivera did both challenge and for me she won. I love to see Nessa do 10 dollar date and Roni 10k. It will be fun. Pls do part 2.
I fell so bad but atleast they're happy
WE GOT 50 CENTS LEFT........ IK WUT THAT MEAN-  *shows 6 foot tall man and 5 foot tall woman riding kids carousel*
hahahahah Aaron “is this a prank”
I think it would be nice to do a $100 vs $1000 date It seems more reasonable. This was cute though.   Most people don’t have $1000 to budget for a date  so $ 10,000 is like for rich people.
part 2 please also nessa and roni both look gorgeous 🤪💖💖
Ngl  I feel like Nessa a nd John were the rich parent who don't really pay attention to their two kids Roni and Aaron lol
I love 13:21
aaron squishing himself on the carousel is sending me 😭😂
You guys should do a part 2
Why’s don’t you say he’s your boyfriend
i think u guys should do a part two i love videos with John and Aaron
Yessss! Please switch! That is a video I neeeeddd to see!!!!❤️❤️❤️
I think ronron will donate their 10k$ date money
John said "WE need money to be happy" while ronron giggling with ten dollar🤣💜
14:50 NESSAS LAUGH WAS SO EVIL
i wanna see part 2 of this
Aaron so funny
Part 2 plz🤍💙💜💗
Oh definitely switch please do it
Definitely switch
aww i love how roni and aaron still had fun while only have to spend 10$ on there date awhh, they are so adorable
You should have gave the shout out to the Sidemen they created this concept
If u google is Veronica Merrel and Aaron dating it says that they have been dating since 2017 IS IT TRUE.
Yes please reverse roles! I would love to see how the dates would go!
yes a part two!! I was really surprised with roni's trip to the thrift store lol and I'm really curious to find out what nessa's ideal $10 date would be like.
wait hows jonh
a part two where you two switch roles would be amazing lets goooo !!
😂😂😂😂 “Thousand dollar bills” brought to you  by Vanessa Merrel
Def switch roles! I'm curious about how ronnie would plan her 10k date lol
Part 2 pls
Yesss do a swap!!!
They are all perfect.
One of my favourite videos so far!
Hold up since when did nessa have a boyfriend. I’ve not watched them for like 2months now
ANOTHER IDEA: have each couple plan a date for the other couple! 🎉🎉
I love u guys and Lexi Rivera! The last video i watched was actually her recent video of her getting ready for a "date".
Can you do another one but the couple’s witch BUT they can NOT do the same thing like each other?
Is Roni dating Aaron? I’m lost lol

How did Nessa booked the Helicopter ride and the stylist and rent the Porsche all the same day and within few hours? Is it possible? I’m just asking don’t come for me guys.

Part 2 part2
FINALLY VANESSA Admitted THAT JOHN IS HER BF but               But for some reason Veronica did not Admit that Aaron is her bf to .... WEIRD!!!!!😂😂
I like how Nessa said "My boyfriend" and Roni just said Aaron lol
I can’t get over how amazing John and Nessa looked when they were off to dinner. Green is their color for sure !!
Ok....did this video confirm Aaron and Veronica are in fact dating ????
SWITCH!!!!!
I love Roni and Aaron’s date more ❤️
aaron sounds so much like alex wasabi its funny 😆
Yes do a part 2🎊🎊
Ok but why aren't we taking about how nice that guy was that helped Roni and Aaron
You can say that Aaron is a real Filipino by making "tawad" in the thrift store
Aaron: this is one of OUR- I mean the best date ever
Yes switch and make another video pleaseee
roles reversed now Roni and Aaron should enjoy themselves too
I love Aaron and Ronis date
I think roni's more fun
Yes, i think yall should switch

i love roni and aaron’s outfits 😩 i strive for that relationship
Nessa and john are the cutest couple ever 😆😆😆😆
Skipped past the all the Nessa crap 🥱🥱 RonRon, as always is better :)

I couldn't stop smiling watching Roni and Aaron's date 🥺 it was so cute and fun. I love how silly they were together!
Roni: Alright Aaron, straight! Also Roni: Oh My gosh. Aaron: *evil laugh*😈
THE FACT THAT THEY PRAYED FOR THEIR FOOD 😭💕💕💕💕 seriously this was one of my fave videos from you guys

Ronrons date looked so funnn
Yesss y’all should switch!
i prefer ron ron date
You guys should do switching dates for a day! Love the videos! Keep up the good work! :)
The real ones that started this trend are the Sidemen 💪🏻🔥
I think John is using them for money
ilyyyy guys 🌸❤️❤️🌸 ur videos are so much funnnn
Lmao I'd love to be with someone where I know I wouldn't be judged. Ronron's date is definitely my ideal date, I'd love to goof around with the person I'm with instead of going for the romantic vibe 😭
Tell me why Aaron KILLED that dress look 😌
I hated n’essaie and Johns date there so conceded in this video
I LOVE this!! Cutest couples🥰!♡ please do a part 2!!
YES SWITCH!!
I think I missed a chapter😃 Why didn't anyone tell me Vanessa has a bf!😭
😂😂😂 ron ron date was so much fun and full of memories 😂 they have make the video hilarious 🤣
What happened to Christine 🤔
Yes do a switch. In my opinion i prefer if no one was to spend a lot of money on a date. Im very simple, like all u need is to spend time with one another and have fun.
Honestly this is the best part of my day and usually the members stream is amazing anyways hope y’all have an amazing day and lol I saw her vid too❤️
Aww that thrift shop cashier was so nice!
Picasso/Pica won't be happy about this
The vids with the Twins, Aaron, and John are my fav! More more more 🤩🤩
Omg I love Lexi Rivera!
Part 2 please
I’m so happy for Vanessa she looks so genuinely happy with him
It’s funny how Roni just says I’ll be taking Aaron and Nessa say I’ll be taking my Boyfriend John
Aw bless roni for praying
Ronron was dressed like an old couple in a Kdrama 😭
Jose was nice like whatttt
You guys awesome
I think Vanessa is With the Porsche And her dress
nessa you look AWESOME in your dress! don't worry roni, you look awesome in your hat.
I would love to see another one where they switch 😂 Surely it would be fun too
guys do the part 2 switch roll
Definitely switch I enjoyed this video very much and would love to watch another one of these
OMG I was literally thinking to myself, "they should make a part two but switch roles", and then Nessa literally said that exact thing! But seriously ya'll should make a part two.
please do one where you switch!
Switch!!
i love this videooooo
I love how Veronica and Aaron are such good best friends that she can take him on a date  I also love Johns  sarcasm my favourite are  “ well, WE need money to be happy”
Yess let’s see the roles switch!! I want to see Aaron and Roni get that fancy date and vice versa! Loved how much fun you could see Roni and Aaron were having!
I love Vanessa and John. But my dream date is more like Roni and Aaron. Anyways, both couples looks great!👍👍
at this point roni and aaron are already dating in my eyes
hi
Hold up John and nessa are dating…?
Please do more videos of Paul picking out outfits to wear.
P222222
For the rest of John's life he'll always have the bragging rights of...."Oh yea??!! Well I had a Merrell Twin take me out on a helicopter ride once"    That's a tough one to top
Yess part 2 and switch!!
Aaron looks like he’s wearing a dress 😂
Yess do the other way around! This is one of my favorite videos
Would love to see part 2
Claim your “here within an hour” ticket right here
RON RON WAS HILARIOUS. They made me happy as I laughed a lot lol
The real question is that is roni dating aron
You guys scared me at the beginning of the video.I thought I was not going to get a “hey guys I am Veronica and I am Vanessa” this week.😌👌🏽
YES SWITCH THAT WOYLD BE SO FUN 🥰
Witch the date change
RonRon’s was more wholesome, but they’ve M together longer. I feel like Nessa & John are still at an awkward stage
yea, u guys should switch!
Yes!! Switch for the next video 🤣 this was too funny
I love seeing Roni try to get her and Aaron in the same shot because Aaron's so tall😂
John peeked hahahaha. That is why he didn't have a big reaction to the Porche

Johns green blazer looks awesome 👍👍👍
aaron: how did u get a porsche for 10 dollars meanwhile me cracking up because of his confusion
I vote you guys do the switch and let ronron be extra for change. 😊👍🏽✨
hi I don't want to be rude but I really wish for more or better video quality like 2k or even 4k ty :)
John gives me Chris’s Watts vibesz. I’m a intuition reader and ugh I hate he’s vibe. But I wish you the best.
Can y’all do a house tour?
NESSA "AND John drove really fast!"  PAUL MERRILL: *sweats* *cringes* *gulps* "horrible idead." (In the background)
change the description to $10,000 *****
Yeah defo switch it. It’ll be cool to see how you both do the “other” date.
I LOVED THIS VIDEO!!!! It was so good!!!! You guys all had AMAZING Outfits!! Love you guys!!! xoxo
Yes! We need a part 2:) love you guys!
Yes plz part 2
Who else loves the merrell twins? I do!! They are so amazing 🤩 love ya merrell twins <3
PLEASE DO THE SWITCH THIS IS SO MUCH FUN WATCHING YOU GUYSSS 😍😍
Next video you guys should switch where Roni and Aaron go on a $10,000 date and Nessa and John should go on a $10 date XD
Think it should be 100 or 1000 ten isn’t really much to do a full day date..  think nessa would of hated the 10 dollar date
The best youtubers in the world everyone should sub no matter what dont listen to de haters "slag" cringe sos😂😊
SO you're telling me they went to the ODYSSEY?! 2 MINS AWAY FROM ME?!? IM SO SAD
it would be sooo fun if you guys swapped for the next one :)) just to see what you could do with a different budget like yessss
11:03 yas roni!!!
Y’all should switch!
Can I see part two where y'all switch amounts then a part three where the guy or you get like a middle amount and we see the difference
Boujee it's not a compliment🤫 . I loved Veronica's date 🥰
Plz you guys should do the swap date where Ron Ron get the 10,000 dollar date plz 🥺🙏   Pretty plz with the cherry on the top 🥺
Part 2!!! yes!!!
I’m sad that the uploads are during my school hours 🥲
Yessss! Switch roles!!!
Roni: "We don't need $10,000 to have fun. John: “Well we need money to be happy” Lmao did this get anyone laughing
I would definitely want to watch a part 2. Though Roni and Aaron had fun and did what they could, they deserve a $10,000 date
Yes Part 2 plz
At 15:00 this Roni and aaron looks like kids , saying goodbye to there parents 🤣
ok but Jose was really nice for helping y’all out!! 😭
I was waiting for one of the guys to say "no". 😈 Aaron with the negotiation skills! 💰 Swapping for the part 2 would be fun.
Roni looks cool 🤣♥️✨
YES PART 2!!!
switch!!!
They should definitely do this again but switched ❣😂
you should switch roles
My favorite is that the RonRon thing isn't a big deal anymore, it feels normal and they are so adorable. ❤️ I love it
Roni’s face when nessa was talking about her date 😂😂
Yess switch it up I wanna see what Ness and John will do with the 10 dollars!
Loll😆🤣😂 This is like the opposite of when they switched rooms now nessa is living the good life
Its pronounced PORSCH-UHHH
I loved roni’s date it was funny and cute
You guys should do this again just the other way around and see how that goes!!! :)  (Omg literally as I was typing this nessa said it lol)
Yes you should do a swap
“V+A= VA”
You guys should do this again just the other way around and see how that goes!!! :)  (Omg literally as I was typing this nessa said it lol)
YES part 2!!
I wonder what roni would have done with the $10K. I think it was more suitable for Tessa and John to have the $10k because John seems like a guy who is not into thrifting and would not have fun without money. but next time, I would like roni to have the money. she and Aaron are the best!!
that was cool and yeah i think you should part 2 😂🤍
Definitely loved Roni & Aaron’s date! Would love to see a part 2!
Yes switch it I want to see that
Yeah switch I love that you post new videos on Tuesday I can watch them while I relax because it's my day off work. Your videos are too much fun make me smile. Ron Ron's outfit is pretty funny but as long as they are together made the 1o dollar date work.
i love how roni and aarons faces were when roni broke the chalk thing hehehe p.s love u guys so much
John: Well we need money to be happy. Lol
Good thing Roni and Aaron aren't actually dating and are instead just best friends. They seem way better as friends and could probably never date each other.
You guys have to do this again but switch the amount of money!
16:48 Roni: 😲 Aaron: 😃 I love this 😂
You should do a part 2
I would definitely love to see you guys switch I think it would be fun.
DUDE this is sooo funny 🤣🤣
Aaron looked good in the dress, he should use it again😏😁
Pt .2 please
Roni and Aaron’s outfits💕
You guys should definitely do a part 2!!
Nessa’s outfit was so pretty 🤩
6:25 😂😭💁‍♂️
Please make a part 2 would love to see it
yessss switch roles
The RonRon date looks really fun, I can't wait to try it! Would love to see a part 2 with Nessa and John doing the same thing! (:
Ron Ron needs a 10k date!
I don’t think the merrelll twins realize how there making everyone’s day better with there videos ❤️
I think you should switch roles. I personally think Roni date was the best I think it was just fun and that’s what I look for on dates. Like don’t get me wrong going on to a fancy restaurant was cool but for the money I just think it’s too much for a date. That’s more something I’d do if I was married and not just dating I hope my view makes sense.
Fun fact: Every single Tuesday, the Merrell Twins just make our day💕🤗💖💖🌹🌻🌼
I  believe Arron and roni were the perfect type of people to be on a 10 dollar date
PART 2
Definitely picking the $10 date. I don't really have to have money for a date. That's how I feel anyway. Love this idea though
Part 2
definitely do this again!!
You guys make my day
YES DO THE SWITCH!
YES SWITCH I LOVED THIS VIDEO
I love how Roni and Aaron prayed for  their lunch! ❤🙏
john calling nessa a greek goddess omg my heart
PART TWO!!!
There should be a part two I love that this one and I think Roni and Aaron’s date was the best
I love how real you guys are I want to be just like you some day any advice?
John is so pure I’m glad nessa finally found someone who appreciates her
Don't get me wrong, but why you don't donate to a good charity or something? I mean, 10,000$ will be very useful for people with low needs in foreign countries. For example recently in a Island name Guanaja in Honduras, every citizen lost their home because of a fire. Do you feel me? Better things can be done with that money. Love watching you guys tho 🥰
Do a Part 2 of $10 and $10,000 date and switch, it would fun, and so Roni and Aaron can experience a fancy date, and a simple and Happy date for Nessa ang John 💕💕 ENJOY and Always Keep Safe 😘😘
Yall shod definitely do a pt. 2
Plz, do part 2!!!!!!!
SWITCH!!!!!!!!
YESSS PART 2!!!💙💜
For my opinion, you didn't need a lot of money to make your date happy and exciting, Roni and Aaron enjoy their date together, and the most important is they enjoy ❤❤ Fan from Philippines 😘
Honestly Ron Ron Have fun just hanging out so I can see them b Happy with both amounts of money dey are both down to earth so sweet
wait yes part 2, i was thinking this the whole time while watching. It totally be fun to see how you guys would do it, if the roles were switched
Anyone else Go back on the video to see If Roni called Aron her Boyfriend After Nessa said My Boyfriend John lol
I love how Aaron is not willing to believe that the Porsche isn't for their date 🤣
Wait are Roni and Aaron dating?   its a joke, ITS A JOKE😆
I love how nessa is freaking out with the big amount of money! A lot of people think that nessa is like a mean and bratty person BUT SHES NOT!!!! Shes a wonderful, kind and good person! And the way she acted with all dat money showes and proves that shes so humble!
Yes!! I would love to see a video with the dates reversed. This video was funny
So it’s confirmed roni and aaron are dating
Part 2 please HAHAHA Roni team should experience the 10k  and team nessa should experience $10 but your dates is so fun
Hello
It would be cool to see things swapped in a part 2.
OMG I MISSED A WHOLE STORY I DIDN’T KNOW SHE HAD A BF
John doesn’t seem very exited lol
Piper rockel has done this to
Part 2!!!
Should totally do a switch and see how the other spends the money on their date
Do a part 2 please!!
Yesss switch please
The part where Nessa and John drove away in the Porsche while Roni and Aaron watched them leave in their thrifted outfits was hilarious 😂😂
Ngl I get brandon feels from John
I think it would’ve been great to see nessa with the 10 dollar date
It was actually lexi Hensler’s video
I liked roni and Aaron’s so much more
Pleeese part 2!!!! This was so fun!!
its appropriate nessa got the more expensive date, theyre a newer couple
honestly, aaron and roni’s date seemed better than needs and john’s. it seemed more heartfelt
ok hear me out, John and Aaron on a bro date 👀
i LOVE the jack & the box date. 10/10
THE MOST FUNNY MOMENTS, LEAVE A LIKE IF YOJ AGREE Aaron- I like green John- Its because it is the colour of money  John- Well, we need money to be happy-  Roni-  A v and an A. V Plus  A equals VA  * me thinking about Aaron, Nessa, Roni and Alex VAVA SQUAD * Aaron- I thought we were Ronron  Roni- We have 50 cents, I know exactly what we should do! The next clip riding on a horse KILLED ME, GO RONRON AND JONESSA
PART 2 Switch date!!!!
Yes for switching!
Yass switch pls! It would be so fun and I love this video!
I honestly skipped all the parts of Vanessa’s date and I only wanted to watch Roni’s and Aarrons date
Aarons hair looks good!
no more Alex...
Not Nessa and John dressed all fancy while driving a Porsche, meanwhile Aaron and Roni have their $6 thrift store outfits while stood there with their unicorn jello and chalk😭😭
If I had a $10 date I will be able to get something to eat
Okay but this is beyond hilarious 😂😂😂
vanessa dating a cancer .. i see u girl 🌟🌟🌟
I would go on either. They were both fun in different ways. You guys should switch. It would be fun to see what the other would do on the opposite budget.
Nessa’s hair is beautiful! Love the side part!❤️❤️
Good afternoon stay safe
I would rather have 10 dollars than 1,000 and I like ronni better
i vote for a part two!!
Since when we’re Vanessa and John official?
Part 2!
I can’t stop laughing at Roni and Aaron just watching Nessa and John ride off in the Porsche all dressed up😂😂
I love John's sense of humour 😋
I always though veronica would date aron first
I feel like roni and aaron really carried this video
"Green is the color of money" J.V That's it. Quote of the year
PLEASEEEE DO PART TWO OF THIS VIDEOOOOO
It was actually Lexi Hensler not Rivera but it’s okay 😂😇
Such a great video idea! You should do a part 2 where Roni and Aaron go on a 10.000$ date and Nessa and John go on a 10$ date:)
i love this video! RONRON were having so much fun, i love them
I like the 10 dollar data more
I liked roni and aaron's date better, they are so cute 💕 and I laughed so much 😂
Nessa: **points camera to sky** beautiful DinNeR  Also nessa:**points camera at her bf* bEauTIfUl vIeW
I laughed so hard with this video, you guys are great 😂❤ yeees please a part 2 🙌
I would have done Ronis date.
love you girlsss
please do a part 2 I love this video and y'all so much!😘😘😘
You all should definitely switch and do a part 2! You can compare and see which one you liked the most and would do again.
Aaron and Roni are too pure for this world🥺🥺
Pt 2
it's not a hate. but nessa has change??
Yesssss plsssss do a part 2 where u guys switch that would be really cool Bc i loved this video y’all were so cute 🥰❤️
Are we just not going to talk about when Ronron was doing chalk and she broke the thing I was during laughing😂😂😂😂

God loves you.
I love Roni and Aaroni
Yes switch the dates
Now time for Roni and Aaron to get the $10000 date
Ronron is real.
But like why do I wanna go on Ron Ron's date more? Lol
I wonder how it would be if it was the opposite 😅
yesssss! Plz do a swap and have Nessa and John do a $10 date and Roni and Aaron do the $10,000 date
So just sidemen Sundays but a bit worse litlitlit
Vannnesa is showing ron ron won
You guys should compete with the best $20 date
Lol so funny loved nessas green dress sooo pretty
Message looked a little different lol
Aaron silent disappointment for the Porsche 😂😂 i dont care i got my car
Roni: "Aaron your pants!" Aaron: "Fashion statement" 😂😂😂
I like roni for some reason. Other than the outfits ofcourse...😅😅
switch
You guys should definitely switch next time
Part twooooooo.
We need a part 2 plzz!! Btw loved this vidd💖
GURL SINCE WHEN DO YOU HAVE A BF??!!
I knew Vanessa was going to get the 10K one. Seems fitting and she looked astounding in that dress.
You guys should definitely do this again but your budget should be swapped and you guys should make it so you can’t repeat the activities that were done in the first video!
John’s “yeah” after Nessa asked him out on a date had me like 🥺🥰❤️🥰🥺😍
Pleasse, part 2
You guys should do a part 2 where Roni and Aaron get the $10,000 and Nessa and John get $10 and see what you guys do
Cant wait for the switch part of this
Yess do a wap
This Video proves it’s not about the money it’s about the person
Honestly the date that Arron and Roni went on seems to me to be the more fun options
Yess a part two please
$10:00
part 2 where they swap budgets? :)
Couple expectations vs reality right there✨
Go back to the thrift store and tip Jose well! He was so kind!!
roni and aarons was my fav especially at 17:10, i busted out laughing when she broke the chalk thingy.
do a part two plz
I loved roni's and Aaron's date. Because I could relate. I'm poor. See money doesn't matter.. you can have fun either way. I wanted to see Roni's date more. I was skimming through to find hers.
Yessss switchhhhh
Yesssss please
We need part 2 plz
I feel like Roni and Aaron looked like the kids and Nessa and John were the parents
Part 2
You guys should do what you said, switch dates! It would be really fun ot be able to compare what you would do different😊💜🖤
i really think you should do a part 2
yes switch roles!!!
I love RonRon!! The carousel ride is so funny
Ooh my God
swtich! that would be so fun to see the differences
Plz switch
John seems abit dead ngl like not a vibe
Cheap dates are the best 👌
Yes switch
Love this! You should do a part 2
Roni and Aaron date seemed more fun to me. But maybe that's just because I'm poor lol
I like both so yeah
I love your videos 💖🥺
Nessa: Delicious dinner, beautiful view, best date ever. *cuts to Roni and Aaron drawing with chalk on her back porch Roni:  wah, you broke the chalk!?
i got the same shoes as Aaron! never seen anyone else with those shoes hahaha 🤩
I felt kinda bad for the thrift store guy. He was SO nice! I hope they go back and spend more money there.  It didn't feel right to watch them bargain on something that was already discounted when they could usually afford it (I understand that it was for the video, it's more about the principle of trying to get a bigger discount on something that is already discounted, and you can afford the initial price)
To bad that NESSA didn’t really use $10,000 on her date. There was so much more she could have done like gone to a ball game in a box seat or something come on it LA there must be lots to do like Disneyland private tour or universal studios. I hope if they switch that Roni will be more creative!!
Roni and Aaron look like younger siblings watching their older siblings go out
CONTENT CONTENT CONTENT
Aren't they going to donate the extra money they didn't expend on the date, that would've been a good deed
Roni and Aron 😂 you made my day. The message of the video is that you don’t need a lot of money to have fun, you just need the right person. I love you guys 💜. I’d love to see Nessa in a 10 dollars date 😂 and Roni in a 10000 dollars date.
I feel like roni and Aarons could make any date fun no matter the price!!
I was really hoping Roni got the 10$ because of her creative personality, I knew she could come up with something fun!!!
Part 2! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 Switch roles 🥳
Those two Guys are very lucky to be Dating Twins and two very beautiful and loving ladies. Heck yeah do the switch date Challenge .
switch and make a part 222222 pls u guys are amazing 🤩
yes! switch! i feel like if roni and aaron had the “$10,000” date, they wouldn’t know what to do with all the money 😂❤️
I love how it cuts from John and Nessa living life to Roni and Aaron just trying and laughing 😃 😀 😄 sooo wholesome
I want the next video to be the amounts switched!!! I need to see what the reverse would do!!!!
Nessa blushing throughout the date🥺😍
I love you guys so much your great role models
Yes flip it!!
Omg Nessa and John looked STUNNING 🤩
hold up... WHO PLAYS THE CELLO?!?! omg
I DO AGREE AND I ALSO LIKE GREEN
Your videos never disappoint me 🙌🏻💘
I wonder what would nessa plan for a $10 date 🤔
Aw I really love Roni an Aaron’s date 🥺🤍
I WILL DEFINITELY BE WAITING FOR THE NEXT DATE!!
roni disinfecting their clothes is everything cuz same
Nessa and John are on the honeymoon face while Roni and Aaron seem like an old married couple.
Omg ness a hair is so pretty in this video love you guys 10,000 dollar date was so fun to watchhh❤️💓💗
Please switch roles!!! ♥️
Yes!!! I need a part two !!
we need more joses in this world
Please do part 2
switch
I thought christan was your bf
i was awwww-ing the whole time i saw aaron and roni! its soo cute that they dont need money or a planned date and just need each others company to do fun stuff together! thats the best part of going from being best friends to being a couple for so many years! john and nessa are super cute too but their dates in general look very formal while roni and aaron are soo goofy with each other! but ig as the years go by they'll loosen up! loads of love to both the couples!! also we would love to see a switch of the 10 and 10000 dollar dates! love u guys soo much
Nessa and John looked so good!! Roni and Aaron looked spectacular 😂 I think they both did great w the dates
I really wanna see them switch in another video cuz I’d love to see how roni and Aaron use the $10,000 and I’d love to see what nessa and John can do with the $10
I love how nessa is so happy while John is as well but not as exaggerated with all the expensive stuff.
“V+A is Va” “I thought we were Ron Ron though” 😂😂😂
This was by far my favorite video in a long time!! ♥️ I could stop laughing at the comparison between the two!! 😂 So cute! I would love to see another video like this but in reverse!!
I laughed so loud when Roni and Aaron were looking at the car pulling off🤣🤣🤣
This was one of the best videos!! Nessa did not hold back to protect Roni’s feelings.  I loved all the Ronron cuteness content. I wish Ronron bought nice clothes just to show tht u can still have nice clothes with $10  I really really hope they switch places. And Ronron do a $10,000 date
awww nessa and john r so cuteee 🥺♥️
John is the only one saying "Porsche" correctly lol I like him more and more everyday
Roni: a Aaron: but the porsche-
When she wrote V+A it didnt click that it was their abbreviations I thought Virginia
Please do switch rules!!! 💜
Yess
The comedic timings in this video were so good. I couldn't stop laughing😂
Switch Roles
Is Aaron and  Roni dating?
I really enjoyed RonRon date…They are so cute and funny♥️Meanwhile nessa and John are having a cool date (like that one)♥️Both were worth the money and worth the day♥️
Any video with roni and aaron together i know i am going to be entertained
I ship Aaron and Roni!! They're literally meant for each other!
I think you both should switch the money thing nessa and john 10 dollars and roni and aaron 10,000 dollars its fare and square!
i hoonestly prefer roni and aaron's date because it felt more personal and it's something i'd do with my friends. But if i had the money, i'd love to try out nessa and john's date since i've never been to a fancy date.  and i think i'm talking for everyone when i say we dont want a part 2. We NEED a part two.
I did watch this video but I forgot to comment so here is my comment btw from Australia  You guys are amazing people my dream is to go meet you guys one day and live with you guys forever because I don't love my family I cry everyday because I want to be with you  plz guys see this comment and replie I cry everyday because my parents don't make me happy they act like if they didn't want me I hate them plz help I am ten so I am waiting ten more years so I can fly to you guys get a car and find your house and then live with you guys after telling my story from Australia plz read this plz or can you fly me to you guys or you come here plzz
YES PLZ do a part 2. and switch!!!!
Aaron and Roni 😂❤❤❤
Whyy i like roni and aoran date more than nessa and john 🥰
Yes switch!!!!
Yessss switch please I love your videos and u always make my day so much better!❤️‍🔥
Also can you post on one of your side channels obviously not this one cause I know you guys have a certain rhythm and schedule with this account but can you post only Arron and Roni’s date cause I love seeing the contrast but I lowkey hate seeing flashy flashy so I’d like to just see a video with only clips of the $10 date
10 $date loooks more interesting and fun
I guess Nessa and Roni are so used to say stuff at the same time that they don't notice when they do. At least they have no reaction to it. But John has! 😅 18:08
You're adorable
Switch it pls we wanna see part 2
I love this so much😂🤣😆😅
Yasss go for the switch!
18:06 - That "Yay!" must have been Nessa getting in to Roni's mind! Sooo Nessa 😁😄
Ronron will be forever my favourite 💜
This gave me such Barbie: Princess and the Pauper vibes
please do a part two
You should reverse now
Part 2
The will smith part tho!!😂😂
The prayer was so sweet 😭❤
Nessa: Delicious dinner, beautiful view, best date ever ☺ Roni: You broke the jar?! (Sorry, don't know how to spell "jar". Thats how the "lyrics" you can put on the video spelled it) 😂
Next time Roni and Aaron should have $10,000; Nessa and John should have $10
I want to see what Roni plans with 10,000 I'm sure she would do literally the same as she did with 10 dollars She's so much fun (Nessa too but I think she likes to be more bougie)
Definitely do a part 2! Loved the video.💜
$10 sounds like a wonderful date.  It makes you time more about each other instead of the money.
Can you pleaaaase do it the other way around too
They both are so pretty
yes pls switch too!!!!!
switch and do another one. Loved this 🌺 Aron deserves to be bougee too
Iam cracking up 15:00
Yall are hallarious
Yes!!!! Part 2
I think Roni’s date seems more fun
I loved Veronica’s date it was more funnet and cool vanessa’s was boring and basic
AARON ON THE CAROUSEL STOP
when $10 dates are you and your bf’s thing 😂
swich
Next video should be the same idea but the roles switched!
Not gonna front I would dream about going on the $10,000 date with Vanessa but my mind and heart are telling me that I would want/ rather go on the $10 date with Veronica cause it would be more interesting and I feel like I would be more grateful and focus more of the funny money saving memories instead of feeling spoiled
I’m begging for part 2 🙏
Rni and Aaron buyed food for less than a dollar, and Nessa's *appetizer* (alone) costed "a 100 dollars" 😂
Switchhh scenario's and let Roni go on a 10,000$ date
Do a switched one and guys the video was FUNNY. It honestly made my whole day and love you guys❤😍
Poor RonRon
Roni and Aaron would have been so excited for the 10k date they should do a part 2!
I cannot sksksk.. Roni should get a $10,000 date too :)
I think them switching would be great just to see how their dates are different
Aaron’s outfit is 👌🏻👌🏻😂😂😂😂
I love how roni and Aaron made the best out of 10 dollars it was nice mostly for the people that don’t have much money.😂😂😂😌
Nessa and John: okay John:😃 Nessa: keeps talking  John:😐.... yup   💖hope you guys had fun!💖
SWITCH ROLES
Aaron and Roni are the best people to get the $10 date
you guys are so cute this video made me so happy thnak you :D xx
"we're breaking gender barriers" PERIODT
I agree Aaron 😂
Pls do the switch
WE NEED PART TWO!!!
Part 2
Weird Flex, but okay.
Both dates looked amazing! Nessa and John, I'm impressed by your relationship. Loved his comment about you being a Greek goddess💞
Yesssss please do a switch!!
I would love to see Nessa and John with the $10 date 🤔😂
Definitely switch budgets this was great
John is actually really funny lol we have the same sense of humor. He is probably a good fit for Vanessa
Next Tuesday pls do a part 2  Roni and Aarron will go on a 10,000$ date and Nessa and John on 10$ date.
This video was so funny and cute at the same time😫💖
I would marry Vanessa, but let's be honest roni's date looks the most fun. Would definitely go on a date like that.😃😄😁
The humble date makes me happier 🤗
PLEASE do a Part 2 where the roles are reversed! It will be so entertaining! This video is so cute! :)
Roni and Arron had to get the 10$ because they are seriously so hilarious!!! Their date looked awesome. John is too cold.
Ron Ron was the perfect couple to get the $10 date lol I was crying, I was laughing so hard!
'lets get to chalkin' -roni best phrase of the vid 😂
Part 2 please 😆
part 2
Aron and Roni are so funny lmao
The way Nessa sayd "Lech go" 😂 14:51
Now you guys should switch the rolls 🤣
roni and aaron were so confident in their date. it looked so fun
13:24 - Kind of looks like you have lost a bet 🤣 LOVE YOU! ❤
They should switch it up now I wanna see what Nessa and John would do with $10! 👀
Part 2!!!!!!!
I definitely want to see a pet 2!!
Ilove Lexi revera
Yes, do the switch video!!!
Yesssss swith!!
Yes, We need Part 2! ✨ Both the dates were cool 😂
13:24 - Ahhh! What a fun playdate... 🤣🤣 Just kidding! Your awsome!
are veronica and aaron 7 years apart
so sorry for aron happy for john a luxury date for Vannesa and john
I think both dates show that you can still have fun no matter how much money you have to spend it just depends on who you are with. Cuz you can go on a 10 thousand dollar date and it still suck/not be fun.
A prayer is a prayer 🙏🏾
Nessa’s dress was outrageously beautiful!!
Switch it guys and make a part 2!!!
Part two
i honestly love both but the $10 one just seemed so hilarious and casual, but it would be easy to give up on it yk? but overall great video!!
Yes please on part 2! I like seeing John's funny side, when he mentioned Aaron likes green because it's the color of money, asked how much the carousel cost, when he acted bummed when he wouldn't wear the dinosaur sweater anymore, and when he vouched being at the odyssey lol. Hope to see that smiling light Vanessa brings out of him more. Btw, the sweater brought out the color of his eyes. Ronron will always make me laugh!!! Best, best friend couple ever. They really did make the best of the $10, the last 50 cents used after they said, "you know what thaat means!" was hilarious. I thought it was going to be a bouncy ball machine or something of that sort. I couldn't help but laugh literally out loud when it was them riding the carousel!
i laughed so hard how did you get porsche in 10 dollar 😂😂😂
Yes!! You should switch it uo next time! Im intrigued as to what ronnie would do with 10k and what nessa would with 10 bugs lol. xoxo
Yeah do part 2 switch turns
Yes you guys should switch lol
Yes!!! Switch!
The contrast between the two dates is hilarious 😂😂🤣
They should switch for next tuesdayyyy!!!!1
Totally switch places so I would like to see roni and Aaron spend $10,000
Ronron confirmed
3:05 10k, Nessa. you get TEN-THOUSAND, and you gon rent a fancy sports car? gurl, if i were you, i'd have spent a portion of that 10k on something other than a ten-second-car.
Why did the intro play twice? You could’ve gone without explaining it again after the vvmm screen Only saying this because people tend to like straight to the point intros:)
Part w
I love Ronnie so much. The gasp when Nessa and John walked out all dressed up.
My country opened up after Covid september 25. So now we don't have to use masks, and we can hug eachother and stuff, so I'm very happy and I hope that day will be celebrated every year from now of 😁
whys john so boring and serious
I think Roni and Aaron genuinely had fun I really liked watching them! But you guys should definitely do a part 2🤍
Yes please make nessa and John do the 10 dollar date PLEASE
I'd like to see a part 2 with it switched! Just cause I can't imagine Aaron and Roni doing the fancy date for some reason haha
I would not have imagined this going any differently😂
My jaw dropped when nessa walked out in that dress she is GORGEOUS !!!
I got a slight man crush on John.Looks like a movie star or something.This was a good $10 vs $10 000 video.
I love Ron Ron. “Aaron, your pants!”
I would love to see the swap of money! It would be so fun!!😍😍
Do it....switch...we want a part 2!!!!!!
Yes!! Switch dates in another video!!
Please PLEASE PLEASE PLEAse switch that would be awesome
I like the thrifting and chalk and mini tacos better cause it’s not about money and it’s more about spending good time together
This was hilarious 😂 We definitely need at part 2!!❤️
Idk if its just me but Veronica could be the next Charlie Chaplin from that stylish outfit.
Please do the second part!!!
I think it’s actually a 1,000 dollar date, but I wouldn’t even spend 10,000 on a date. So not judging lol😊 Don’t listen to me I’m not sure
I think you should 100% do it the other way
I would have went on the $10 date
The carousel ride and Aaron's shirt-dress had me dying!!
part 2 for sureee!!!!!
I’m sorry but John always looks so bored on camera lol
I would love to see the Merrell twins do another tv show, where they are superhero(s)!
Roni and Aaron's date was like 2 children having a picnic😂❤️
I thought Nessas date was really amazing but like the ron ron date was so cutee
Aaron were dreaming BIG about that Porsche!!!
Yeeees switch 💜
i would have gone on the $10000 date for sure 🤣sorry Roni😁
Somehow Roni and Aaron’s date seems more fun 😆 Just enjoying each other’s company and being silly while Neasa and her bf are mostly enjoying material things without much creativity. Both dates look great in the end though
Oh my goddd  I loved Roni and Aaron's date😂❤️❤️
car rides
Aaron staring at the Porche longingly.Nope your not driving that unfortunately for you and Roni.😀
Yes switch, this was so funny 😂😂
Yes part 2
Love love this. It was so cute watching u on ur dates. I don’t think it was the money that made the date but the people you guys are. Love you guys
The way they cut from Nessa’s date to Roni’s kills me everytime😂
I hate Jhon
Jesus loves you ❤
Roni with the lysol was hilarious 😂
Yes! Switch!!!!
Love you all
Yes do the switch!! So Roni will do the $10,000 and Nessa does $10! Would love to see how that turns out!
15:00 was the best part of the video omg. I loved roni and Aaron's date, it was so genuine!
what did you wear for your date aaron? aaron: "wellll..."😂😂😂💓💓💜
Yessss switch
When John said “well we need money to be happy”  I’d love to know what his 10$ date would be 😂😂😂
I now need a $10 date vs $10,000 date SWAP EDITION 🥰
This is not supposed to be funny but “V+A= VA” got me 😂😂
This was the funniest Merrell video I have ever seen- and I’ve been watching for 7 years 😂 I was laughing out LOUD 😂
Why am I enjoying the $10 date more😂😂😂😂
Yes
SWITCH ROLESSS!
Yes part two 😻

Yes you guys should now switch and roni should get the $10,000 date and nessa gets the $10 date. I feel like nessa won't be as creative as roni was
“We need money to be happy” I’m sorry but that was NOT it😭
When Roni and Aaron were standing there while John and Nessa just drove of was like watching two parents leaving their kindergarteners home on a date night-
john's reactions were so realll

Remember in your "Reacting to 2018 bloopers live video" everyone chipped Nessa with some John, and he became Nessa's fake boyfriend and the dad of "The Foodbaby"? There must have been someone from the future commenting on that stream 😱

That carousel ride was so *cute* ❤️
Part 2 please... I really wanna see RonRon doing 10,000$ one...😍 Lots of love...Roni and Nessa💕
Roni and Aron's date was really cute tho😊
John and Nessa seem somewhat uncomfortable with each other…Or is it just me? Like they are both trying to impress each other. Or maybe it’s because they are so opposite from Ron Ron 💕 what do you guys think?
15:00 why does it look like a scene from a movie about two sisters, where the one  turned out to be succesfull and rich, while the other stayed and took care of the family, and lived a happily life, until one day where the rich sister returned home and tries to act down to earth, but fails
Mind blown😱😱
the way the boys look at our girls roni and nessa<'33
You guys should definitely do a part 2
Do a part too please im begging you guyssss
Would love to see Roni get the $10,000 date and Nessa $10 date.
This video is soo funny
Ron ron the cutest♥️♥️
roni and aaron getting the $10 date fits their personality so well 😂 i cant imagine nessa and john getting the $10 date but i wanna see that tho 🤣
such a fun cute video 🥺🤍 part 2 plss
Nessa: *talking  Roni: 👒           😐           👕             🩳

59 mins ago EArly
I love these videos with all of you in it!
The number of times he said "okay" lol 😂
hiiiiiii bestiess
I love thier clean humor 😂😂 and how genuine they all are❤

Roni and Aaron's date is so wholesome❤❤
Thanks for buying me a dress Roni 😂
I think this matches the twins' personalities very well HAHAHAHA sorry Roni
Kinda early :) it’s 4am here in Aus rn
you guys should do the switch!!
I vote for a part 2. I wanna see what Aaron and Roni will be like with money.
I would much rather the 10 dollar date honestly☺️☺️❤️
Since Veronica and Aaron had the $10 date and Vanessa and John had the $10,000 date it would nice if they switched roles so basically they should do a Part 2.
I wonder what John and nessa's date would turn out if they had the $10 date haahahha
Your outfits look sooooo good! Can you reply, please...? IT'S MY BIRTHDAY
Ooo some ones jealousy
You guys made my day better thank you so much!!
I love this game you guys!!💜💜💖💖💖💖😄😄😄😄
I think you guys definitely should do the switch
What John said at 14:27 😆
Poor roni please do a part 2
Part 2 with switched roles- YES!
SWITCHHHHHU
RonRon date really said "with the right person, everything seems enjoyable"  Ps: pls make a part 2
Yyesss please make a part 2
You always make my Tuesdays better
Vanessa looks very pretty John looks very handsome king and queen
i would love to go on both plz do a part 2 love this content love you guys!  God bless!!!!!!!!!!
Can't lie, If I got the ten grand I'd slide a Benjamin or two out for the date and totally INVEST THE REST!💪🏻✌🏻💋   Ha Ha , but yeah, have fun! Oh PS. I'd give the loser the other Benny! in this case Roni?😈
Definitely a part 2!! I was thinking that the whole time!!
My God.... never enjoyed any video as much as this one.... I couldn't stop laughing and being happy for all 4 of you.... 💜💘
Does this mean Ron Ron are  official now?
Part 2 please!!!!
the way Ness has her hair today instantly reminds me of 2016/2017 nessa. good times, good times
it was actuall lexi hensler😆
Hello
Switch please 😍😍
17:09 - Poor Roni
Switch dates ,love you girls♥️
I'm curious to see how Veronica would would spend the 10 $100, i feel like she would spend it way differently than vanessa
No but like I would choose the date Roni and Aaron had it's more real and fun
Even though they both had two different prices you know they all had a blast and made the best out of it. Also yes please do a video where you guys switch we would all love to see that
I love how natural u guys are 💜and lol Aaron's reaction was priceless 🤣 Lot of love 💜
I really like Roni date better
when aaron said he liked the color green and john said its the color of moneh, the way nessa laughed after dat was SO savage 😂😂 pls do a part2
Poor Aaron
aaron and roni in an baby carousel is the content i didn’t know i needed 🙏🤩
I really appreciate that we don't know if ronron is real. It may be obvious or not but it still remains a mystery. And it's nice this way. You don't allways have to put your whole life out on the internet. Keeping things for yourself shows that you don't need any form of validation to feel good about yourself. Love u so much ❤
roni was like an ajumma who will make kimchi 😭😭
another one please i loved it please  i love your videos
Pls do part 2
14:46 can anyone find my jaw? Someone said I dropped it near Nessa and John bc they look MIGHTY FINEEE 🤑🤑🤑
Aww Ronron
Think I would prefer the $10 one. Looks more fun😎😁
this video is my favourite video in this challenge .. you killed it 😂♥️♥️♥️
I know nessa's date is great but roni's date seems more fun😂
part 2 :D
hello:>
17:10 has to be one of my favorite moments of this video, roni’s and aaron’s face said everything 😂
14:46 just can't 🤣
Great video, I would have gone on the $10,000 date, and I think you should swop over because I don't think Vanessa could cope on a $10 date.
Roni and Aaron can make anything look so fun like how-
Aaron's reaction to roni getting the $10 date he looked so disappointed.
Do a part 2!!!!!!
Okay now do this again but switch lol
Awww poor Roni and Aaron
Yes u guys should do a switch
I’m really sad. I’ve never been disappointed in a video before but I truly feel like Roni and Aaron deserved the 10,000 dollar date. With all he has gone through and the fact that Nessa always gets fancier things. I just would have liked to see roni getting her moment to shine.
i love how aaron and roni only had 10 dollars but had so much fun too! aww <3 and john and nessa’s look soo cool too!
Thousand dollar bill are a thing in Jamaica where I am from Greta video love you guys
Lol yessss do a video with opposite budgets!!  I’m intrigued to see how Roni would spend the $$
Also, (again) NESSA YOUR HAIR LOOKS SO CUTE
aww nessa looks so prettyyy🥺❤
Aaron: how did you get a Porsche for 10 dollar😂😂
i would so be down for the $10 date as long as I get there in the porsche🥴
I agree 15:10:)
I literally laughed out loud when ronron rode the carousel 😂❤️ they're so cute!!
I love y’all YouTube videos 💕💕💯
Yeees! Second part 2 pls
ALSO Y'ALL ARE SUCH BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE! 😍😍
the way aaron and roni just stood there while nessa and john drove off in their porsche 😭😭😭😭
I hope we get to see a part 2!
Please do part 2 I begin but if you don’t want to I don’t mind all your videos are awesome you never disappoint me you guys are great Youtubers stay safe God bless
please please switch and do the date thing againnnnn
Another one where they switch budgets!!
Aaron and Roni were perfect for the  10 date. I don’t think nessa could have done as good  of a job.
SO cute! :)  I loved the RonRon date it looked so fun! Nessa and John's outfits were fire
I REALLY WANT A PT 2
Pls switch!! Lol
Part 2
JOHN IS SO COOL! I LOVE THAT FOR NESSA
We should make a ship name for Vanessa and john
Thanks for always making me happy watching your videos! 😄 Loved Roni & Aarons date + their fun/positive attitude 💜
Part 2 yes please!!!!!!
if anyone knows where nessa's cute butterfly necklace is from, it's really cute!
Love all the outfits of nessa and john
There is actually a $1000 bill, it was discontinued in 1969 so they are no longer in circulation, but the Samuel Chase was immortalized on the  1000 bill!
Yes, switch for the next vid! I love how Ron Ron prays before they eat!
Out of 10, i’ll give it a 10.. well that’s your whole budget anyway 😂
Ok but why do I prefer ronrons date ahah it’s a whole vibe
You should switch roles
17:10 their reactions😂
Ah yes my future wife taking one of her exes on a $10,000 date
I love them soooooo much
Switch switch switch
17:13 THEIR FACES I CANT
Aaron :"How did you get a Porsche for $10?"  (Aaron's)Best of 2021😂
Don't mind but- Aaron and Roni's date were like kid love and stuff Whereas nessa and John went whole on that one
Well…we need money to be happy  - John 😂😂
This was amazing thanks roni and nessa yes I agree roni and Arron should do 10,000$ date and nessa and Jon do 10 $  date on next video 💜❤️💜❤️
This idea is so fun! You guys are always so creative and fun to watch ☺
I wanna see the switch roles 😂. I wanna do 10 dollars date because that’s the only thing I can afford 😂 but I got no date 🥲
10:36 grandma roni
Um Lexi Hensler did this challenge not Lexi Rivera... Cool challenge tho
Yesss part 2!!!
Why are you so mean to Aaron all he does for you
U guys are literally the best youtubers❤
The way aaron and roni were standing by watching them go in the car was hilarious😂😂
Honestly the $10 date looks way more fun.
*I am really happy for Nessa she finally found someone who truly loves her💕💙. And Roni and Aaron are those kind of couple who gets married and still says we are just friends 😂😂😂😂*
I kept thinking of the song "money is the reason we exist" When I was watching this😆
I think this is the best video ...i love it
Again but swap budgets
This was hilarious!!🤣❤ I loved how they both worked it out and had fun!😊😍
Do a part 2 plssssss that would be amazing
I love your VDS
Seeing aaron and roni's outfit really made me laugh to death 😂☠️
Brother or sister who reads the comment 😊 May God be pleased with their parents long life 🙏🥰❤👍... . .
nessa somehow always gets the better deal. 😂
Definitely would like to see a part 2 where roles are reversed, Roni gets the $10,000 date and Nessa gets the $10 date.
You guys have such good sportsmen ship especially Roni and Aaron because they only had $10 to spend
I feel bad for Roni
I CANT BE THE ONLY ONE WHO WANTS TO DO THE 10 DOLLAR DATE ONE MORE THAN THE 10K ONE  HAHAHAHA
8:25 had me dead
roni and aaron were so adorable
Omg. Nessa looks sooooo fab here
Tuesdays are INCOMPLETE without the merrelltwins ❤️
I died when Aaron said "how did you get a Porsche for $10"☠️
Seriously I kinda liked Aaron and Roni's date better, than Nessa and John 's date 😄😄"RonRon"
I love Aaron and Roni ❤️ to a point where I have started to hate nessa and the new guy 🙄🙄🤣
I died when Aaron said "how did you get a Porsche for $10"☠️
i agree to what aaron said, RonRon have the best date. You really dont need that much money to be happy 💜
Roni and Aaron look like old timey old married couple that has been together for like 40 years and are on a retirement trip or something all in love and weird and cute and happy.
YES YES PLEASE DO A PART 2!!!!
Do a part 2 I want to see how Roni and Aaron go on a $10000 date
YES!! definitely need a pt 2
I'd like to see nessa's $10 date
switch the money and let the boys plan for the date?Sounds interesting!!
Aaron thinking that the Porsche was for Roni and him-
We definitely want a part 2
I loved the fact that John was so appreciate towards Vanessa they make a good couple happy for you guys🧚✨🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Jazmin is such a professional
Ss switch  Pls we wanna see a vedio on it ❤️
You should switch it would be so funny!
This was wholesome
Both dates were really cool on their own way but no helicopter rides for me 💀
Poor Roni and Aaron
16:10 I WANT A JOHN IN MY LIFE PLEASE
“Well we need money to be happy” - John I’m dying !!! 😂😂
I think you guys should do a swap date
This is so funny and calming to watch
Do a part 2 please

Im in love with the bfs videos
I love how nessa and john were showing off their outfits but aaron and roni still had a lot of fun with 10 dollars 😂😂❤❤

17:11 HAHAHHDHADHFHGDJ
PLEASE DO ANOTHER VIDEO WHERE YOU GUYS SWITCH! I feel like venessa is a fancy person in personality so it’ll be really fun😂❤️

Loving the videos with aaron and john! <3
I like how Aaron tried to cover up that he said “This is one of our favorite dates” lol nice try
I swear to god the time they showed both sides of the twins' dates I laughed so bad😂
need a part  2 !!
Twins beautiful👑💗💗💗💗👑👑👑👑👑👑
yes
Bruh, if that isn't a dress, it should be.
Both dates were great. John saying it was the color of money😂 yes you should switch
To be honest, I would much rather go on Roni & Aaron’s 10 dollar date 😂
yes
JOHN AND NESSA LOOKS SO GOOD TOGETHER!! RONI AND AARON TOO :)
The fake smiles of roni and Aaron on the thumbnail 😆😆
I love seeing ronron and jonessa make videos together. I hope we see more videos like this
You gays make my day love you gays so much ❤
YESSS WE NEED A SWITCH!!
SWITCH PLEASE
fun fun!❤️
Aaron: I like green John: it's coz it's the colour of money 😂😂😂😂
could you ladies maybe do more of Merrell Twins Exposed? (and bring back James Llerrem?)
its pronounced por-sha
i literally died when the chalk holder thingy snapped when roni tried opening it 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I died when Aaron said "how did you get a Porsche for $10"☠️
you guys NEED to make who knows nessa better, between John and Ronii!! ❤❤ and see who will win 👀
“We need money to be happy”  -John 😂😂😂
Yes switch!!! I want to see how either one works with a different amount! 💕
Cute couples🥰
when the chalk opener thing broke.. I LOST IT HAHAHA
This shows that it's more important who you're spending your time with and not how much money you spend.
Yes, we need a part 2!! 😁
I’m just cracking up at the romantic helicopter ride versus Roni and Aaron in their thrift store outfits lol 😂
Love your videos please make part  2
y'all shld do a part 2
Nessa: Good old Porsche Me: what!??
thrift store guy was awesome
Omg Roni and Aaron on the baby merry-go-round 😂
Do a part 2 but nessa gets $10 and roni gets $10,000!!
It’s Roni and Aaron standing outside watching them leave for me 😂😂😂
Please do the switchy thingggg! Lyyyyy💖😘🍀
You guys should definitely do a part 2 and switch the money and I love you guys❤❤❤❤❤❤
we DEFINITELY need to see you guys swap situations ❤ love this video so much❤❤
switch switch switch
Hi
Yesss part 2!!!!
Roni and Aaron were so cute. They were like two kids on their date and was only given 5 dollars each by their parents to spend. Good video 💜💜💜 Edit: Nessa and John looked amazing
"I thought these are 1,000 Dollar bills" - Vanessa Jo Merrell 2021
"me too" 🥺 17:00
Definitely do a part 2! I’d love to see what you guys would come up with!
idk if you guys would want to use up another $10,000 BUT I think it would be interesting to switch the roles and see what the others would do. So Aaron and Roni would get the $10,000 and Nessa and John would get the $10
hii girls ❤❤ thank you for being amazing, i love you guys so much ❤❤ your videos has definitely brighten up my dayy soo muchh❤❤ have a nice dayy, love ya❤
17:55 WE ARE NOW VA AND RONRON SHIPPERS! I support both ship names! 😍❤️
Am I the only one who never gets a heart from the merrell twins 😭
This was an amazing video and the dates both turned out well in my eyes and I'm very happy you all had fun in the end!! But you guys definitely got to do a switch video because this was great so I think another one would be great too!!
I like how honest John is
Nessa is looking so good in the video... She is looking like her old self from 2016 (ish)❤️ The video is very good!!!
Wanna see the switch to the guys, Aaron and John see which date they get and how they would plan it 😊
Ok I defo need a part 2 where u switch it around that would be sooo fun😊❤
hi merrell twins I love you so much i spent half of my childhood watching your videos... i never regret it.. Tha how i love them much.. 💖💖   who else love merrell twins? like..
do the switchh
You should do a part two ! <3
Roni and Aaron’s date is definitely my favorite, so sweet and fun 👏🏻 definitely don’t need money to have a great time !
Roni: where are your pants??? Aaron: FasIoN stAtMEnT Roni: Nono not a fashion statement 😅
I thaught roni will confirm that Aaron and her were dating but no 😩😭😂
Fantastic video. That car was cool. Nessa you looked very beautiful in the dress. Your outfit and date was cool too Roni. I think John would have looked good in a dress. Thank you guys because even though you’re busy filming a series, you still film and upload videos every Tuesday for us so thank you. You both really are Goddesses. I love and appreciate you always 💖💜 😊
Doesn’t matter how much money you got, as long as you’re happy with the other person, that’d be awesome 😊❤️
What Ronron did to 50c is so hilarious omg they're so cuteee💕
We want a switch date for the part 2!  Love RonRon's outfit 💜
Wanna try the 10 dollar date thooo looks soooo fun
I love both of the dates 2 totally different dates but equally as fun and sweet as each other’s 😊 I would love to see a part 2 to see what each of you would do differently 😊
Imagine getting a heart from the merrell twins
You should switch but I don't think Roni and Aaron are as  bougie as nessa
SWITCH NOW!
For only having $10 they really made the best of it and had a lot of fun
Woohoo! Commenting first time.I am clicking this at the speed of light.I hope I get a heart from you guys☺️☺️
Do a part 2,3
I still think RonRon date was the best! Who else agrees?
Aaron: "I like green" John: "It's cause it's the color of money" Nessa: "hahaha😂😈 let's go"
Poor Roni. I feel like Roni has bad luck with picking things and therefore my intuition told me she’d get the $10 date.
Okay, now you two switch the date amounts for the next one! 😄
Nessa is going to get it
Obsessed with you guys
Even when I'm an adult I'd still watch y'all, lmao
PLS PART 2!
Now y’all need to switch amounts and can’t use the same ideas lol!!
I don't know if it is just me but I love these duos
This video shows even if you're "broke" you can still have a lot of fun
Watching ronron makes me feel so single... 😭
Loved the video!! Nessa and johns date was so fancy
Part 2!!! ❤️
Making my Tuesday 100x better😊💜
I feel like Arron and Roni would just spend all the money on a bunch of weird stuff
I think this video shows the different perspectives of dates ( not sure I worded that properly lol) but what I mean is that it shows that you can have a great time with or without a lot of money. All that matters is that you have someone you care about to spend that money with whether it be $10 or $10,000.  Roni and Aaron's date was simple and sweet and Nessa's and John's date was more over the top but still beautiful ❤️
I love the guy's personalities it's amazing
do more plsss part 2
Ron Ron is literally the cutest ship💜
MY HONRON HEART❤️ so happy watching them make $10 a great date and make the most out of it😍
Can i have hi pls🥺🥺
Gosh I've never been sooo early
Roni and Aaron's outfits that they chose for each other were terrible😂
ALL MY SINGLE LADIES, NOW PUT YOUR HANDS UP!! 🙋😭
THE COLOR OF MONEY... YALL I CANT BREATHE😭😭😭JOHN IS SO REAL
Y'all should switch bf
That's the best video from a while i liked the video do more stuff like this!
The 50 cent carousel ride got me 😂🎠
Both dates were so cute! I think if there was a switch that would be pretty cool too to see how Nessa would plan a $10 dollar date!
Hey love you guys soooo much 💕💕💕💕❤️❤️❤️🥺❤️😂🖐🏻💕
YASSSS, SWITCH
YAAAS PART 2 PLS
I love you guys sooo much💜💖
I’m loving the ronron and johnessa content!! 💗💜
"cause it's the color of money" - Vanessa Jo Merrell 2021
Yeah switch roles in the next video, love you two and wish you have amazing dates ❤️💖❤️
I really thought Roni would go to the beach with tacos. At least i was rigjt about the tacos
Roni and Aaron's date is goals for me 💜💜 ... maybe that's why I'm single 😭
hello from the philippines 👋 omg nessa looks different 🤩
I know vanessas sauce wasn’t A1 lol
You are the awesomest people ever
roni and aaron are like the BEST couple
I'm gonna take "aaron" on a date, and I'm gonna take my 'boyfriend John' on a date.   roni? when will the label be there, before aaron's name? JK HAHAHA
Oh I'm too early ❤️ claiming the ticket before 1 hour
you guys should do a part 2
Aaron and Roni are literally soulmates
I would like to see this again roles reversed!!!❤️I think it would be really great!!!
Love aarons dress/shirt hahahahaha
I would like a switch 🤩🤩
I really hoped Roni got the $10,000 date.  Because I don’t like Nessa’s boyfriend because I had a crush on her
Omg i love Aaron's reaction! 😂
Nessa look so gorgeous 🥰
Y'all should prank Aaron and John😆
Vanessa you look nice and Veronica you look nice on a low budget 👍
Aaron- I like green John- Cause it is the colour of money.
Switch ! That'll be fun to watch !
finally! 😍
Aaron being shocked at nessa’s and john’s outfit had me laughing so hard!!  Aaron: I like green John: it’s cause it’s the colour of money  😂😂😂
Biggest fan
cute
Just realised that Roni's hat is matching with Guppy's🤣💕
I'm so jelly 😫
Early
Did i miss something.... so veronica and Aaron are together now or something?
HIII early i love you guys sm!! This makes my day 5262626262 times better <33 💗💜
They should do one where Aaron and roni get the 10000 and then Nessa and John get the 10
You guys should do a part 2!!!!! But Roni gets to have the $10,000 date and Nessa the $10 date
I love them!! I mean how can u not ❤️? They're the best people I know! Sooooooooo much love sending everyday
I love Roni’s positive attitude on her date 🥰❤️

:roni dear lord ty for this day and. Food amen  : Aaron amen   I mean like roni said so much and Aaron only said amen 🙏   Lol just kidding Jesus gives us 3 dollars for tacos anyways right??
Wow can we just talk about how pretty nessa's hair and roni's top . They literally made my day one thousand times better . I love merrell twins so much
Am i the only one who feels like vanessa's bf doesn't love her as much as she does at least !
Honestly, Aaron's rocking the Tshirt dress. Look at 'em legs! xD
No one  John- We saw Will Smith’s house, He waved at us  Nessa- He said come over John- We are like no, me and my next movie We are like no
Nessa and john is like flexing at roni's and arroan's faces!
With the McDonald’s app you guys could have gotten a large fries for 1 dollar cmon guys
Yes do the switch I wanna see what You guys come up with
Roni's and Aaron's outifit were the highlight
y’all are so pretty 💜
I loved both dates but I think Roni did really well with the $10!
ronron outfit.. im crying😭🤣🤣
John and vanessa (jessa) ARE ONE MY MY FAVORITE COUPLES!!! They are a perfect match!!❤❤ I am your biggest fan guys
Watching the Merrell twins is the best part of my day Who agrees  👇
RONRON FOR LIFE
Roni and aaron opening the doors for each other was so cute! ❤️
This video was so fun🤣🤣
Wasn't having a good day but since the Merrell twins have uploaded,, my day just got 10 times better ❤️
I LOVE NESSA'S HAIR LIKE THIS 🤍
Roni’s date was very funny and nessa’s date was very cute 🥰
Hi I love u both
I Love the merrell twins so much and they are truly a inspiration for so many things over the year
A FREAKING HELICOPTER????
I think the money part was perfect, roni and Aron made the perfect use of the $10 (and it was so cute and funny) whereas Nessa and John also used the $10000 for such an amazing date!!! I LOVED when John was like "cuz green is the color of money"
Love you guys xoxo You guys are the best
Most genuine thing I’ll ever say is, Veronica and Aaron are perfect for each other, periodt.
Aaron swindling that thrift store employee to allow him to purchase all of those clothes for just $2 involved more horseplay than Vanessa's rented Porsche.
Roni and Aaron’s prayer was the sweetest thing!🥺
Ron Ron is dating
Love your content and videos ❤
Aaron rocking that long shirt 😂👍🏻
I love you guys! You make my day! 😊
I have been watching u guys for so long ur vids are always so fun to watch <3
“how did you get a Porsche for $10” I DIED😭
Poor Roni😕
This has no right being this funny 😂😂😂
So we've reached the date part now!  I'm loving this! I love you guys so much.  Love from India 🇮🇳❤🥺🥰
Merreltwins is such a great motivation for me on my own YouTube journey, I am glad I was motivated by this women's
I love these 4..💜💜💜  This video helps us to realize that it is not the amount of money we spend for our date that is important, but the time spent together and the memories we create.
11:50 🥺🥰
I just love the Merrell twins!😄😉
Your videos literally make my day. You guys have fun no matter what is presented!! Thanks for putting a smile on my face😁❤️
John seemed really not excited lol
John and Nessa are so cute together ahhh
I absolutely love this idea! Goes to show that dates can be fun whether you have a high or low budget!! 🤩🙌🏼
Nessa and John's date is really fun But roni and Aaron's is still fun even tho it's only 10 dollars
Omg Isk if I shud laugh or cry for aaron😂😂😂
Nessa hires a porsche  Roni We are at a thrift store 😂
RONI NESSA!! i seriously love u guys, been following u for a looooooongggggg time, u made my childhood better, and i won't stop opening youtube just for u guys🥰 By the way, Love from Indonesia💗🇮🇩 (sorry if there is a wrong grammar😅)
Roni and  Aaron please start dating
Lol not tryna be mean but johns expressions were so content like it was so suttle. 😂😂😂😂😂
It never really matters about the cost, it’s about the love you put into it 💕
Poor Aaron lol he thought he was driving the Porsche
Aaron sir boi what were u about to say at 16:58 😏😂💜
It’s so funny and sad to watch RonRon date comparing to Nessa and John date
Shoutout to tge thrift store guy that gave them tge clothes for 2 dollars instead of 5/6
10 minutes- 970 likes (1 because of me) 1 hour later- 10 million likes
I'm not even kidding when I say that I wanted a video somewhat like this 💙💜💖

17:44 yes Ness I see what you did there...ah ha beautiful view
Who all found the merrell twins randomly and now don't even miss a single week! that's me! I found you guys on my recommendation and the video that was suggested was you Guacamole WAP parody! I first watched all your guys's music vids and then I watched your other videos!      if you wanna share how you found them, comment
Tuesdays are INCOMPLETE WITHOUT THE MERRELLTWINS
This video was so much fun! Which date would you have gone on? 👀
Claim your "here within an hour” ticket right here
Roni: I wanna take him on a nice date cause he deserve it “  Also Roni: we are just friends “ 😂😂
Roni and Aaron's date was fun! Even if it was a 10 dollar date!
thought they would get rejected for the date
Awww the thrift shop was the best! Jose was so nice!
