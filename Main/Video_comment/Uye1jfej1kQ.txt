Rashford CRUSHES the Bees! 😻 | Man Utd 1-0 Brentford | Premier League Highlights
Marcus Rashford scores! 🤩 | Manchester United 1-0 Brentford | EPL Highlights
I was there
that play at 1.45 was❤‍🔥
OFFSIDE
Why can't this be the same score from the Gtech Community stadium
Rashford player of the season so far
"Pure technique, from a class center forward" 😂🤣
Rashford > Haaland
we need More. Good win but not happy with not scoring more!!
how s ths a squash..? 🤔
Brentford win 4-1 on aggregate 😂
Bang average united strike again !
You should never promote squashing bees come on
Rashford is back
1 goal is not a squash. Its a lil friendly hug
🎉 good job Manchester United
Rushford! :)
Still don’t understand how Toney hasn’t been banned yet ? And no one on sky mentions it ??
Not many seem to be mentioning sabitzers intelligence in the goal? Played a great game, as did mctominay. Also, wish antony would blast a few instead of trying that far post curler everytime. Guy needs to mix it up
'Side foot to generate so much power' !!! Ok😮
How was that not offside.
Yet again they get a decision  That was offside Hate that w⚓️
The worry Wenghorst is not the answer and Ten Hag now knows this,and (God forbid)if Rashford gets injured,who else scores for us?  Martial is injured to many times. Sancho contributes but not enough. Fred once in a while. Who else has their shooting boots on a regular basis for United? And one nil isn’t sustainable each game because at some stage the other team will also score. Worrying.!!
Is it just me who can't get their head around our strange goal kick routine? It makes no sense???
Big win that
I love Manchester United
I love Manchester ❤❤❤❤❤
That celebration just makes him look a ####
Well done for ruining the last 10 seconds of the videos with your recommendations
Glad for the 3points, can't wait for Eriksen and Casemiro to return, I think Eriksen is just as important as Casemiro and when both in the team we look a much better outfit
Utd need to make sabitzer a permanent signing this summer, better than mctominay this season for club and helping with the attacks almost as much as eriksen and Casemiro
Bruno Fernandes is the most overrated player in history
We scraped a win against an in-form Brentford. We need to have a killer attitude if we are to get a Champions league spot
We played very well but we need to score more, this team needs martial to stay fit but he won’t, we desperately need Osimhen. Not Harry Kane because it would bring the same issues that we had with Ronaldo
Stop putting overlays for next video etc over the videos before they finish playing!! it covers the footage. Wait until the end then put them up.
Ivan toney is a class act most strikers would’ve had a hissy fit when they didn’t get it squared back to them, Toney just gets on with it, rarity with all the Whiney players these days.
Overrated scum bags
Offside rule needs to change. How is rashford not gaining an advantage by standing where he was before being passed the ball it's just stupid.
Really annoying how you put the next video up over this when it’s not even finished yet , just add an extra 10 seconds on at the end of the video and put it on then
Can’t wait to get a striker that isn’t a pensioner
The offside rule is an absolute joke for defenders,  rashford practically goal hanging then 2 seconds & 1 pass later he scores, who makes up these ridiculous rules?????????
Nobody squashed any bee's, more like screamed until the bee left via kitchen window.
Seen a better atmosphere at anfield when we smashed u 7 0😂😂😂😂😂😂
Vettel is trying to save the bees and here's Rashford squashing them, smh 😒
Surprised we didn’t concede 3 before waking up
Antony finally using his brain instead of shooting every chance
Still can’t get above the mighty toon 5-1 howay the mags
Antony used his right foot to cross 🥹🥹
no ones talking about de geas save
If it wasn’t for Rashford, we would be in a relegation battle, this whole team needs a clear out & rebuilt. Can’t believe we are in the top 4?
United back to beating average teams 😂😂😂
To United fans, how has Sabitzer been for you?   Chelsea fan and don’t watch too many United games and I always liked him over in Germany.   Just wondering Hm if he has been good for you.
Man United aren’t at the best atm
We really need a proper no.9
That was a boost, didn’t expect us to beat them, fortunately they didn’t turn up.. Casemiro back now, and hopefully eriksen as well, we can kick on in the cups now, garnacho would be a bonus
Getting rid of Ronaldo was our biggest mistake
Rashfords celebration is so lame
A few weeks ago I foolishly said United were looking really good....within that time they have gone backwards. Half of this team are championship players at the very best.
10+ corners taken and no goal is worrying. That's 10 opportunities to score completely wasted
Sabitzer with the assist🔥
United got lucky and didn't deserve a win. A draw would of been fair buts thats football. Really concerned about United and I said from the start don't over hype this manager or the team because neither are anything special. To quickly United have forgotten what the special one achieved in his first season and this team and manager won't come close to doing the same so imo neither the team or the manager deserves the hype. I want proof and that comes in the form of winning the league until that happens I'll stay on the fence.
“Squashes bee’s” it was 1 goal 😂😂
UTFR
Three shots on target 😂
So he wasn’t that badly injured then to pull out of the England squad and swan off to NY? 🤔
I don't get the meaning of the finger to the head
We need Victor oshimen insanely
Beat Brentford > title contenders > lose to Everton
surely rashfords offside goal hanging interfering with play then the ball drops to him while hes just standing right in front of the goal?
Not enough Man UTD
This was my first game back in Old Trafford for at least 4 years. Well in boys
Rashford goal offsidea
Rashford first half strike enough to enable W for MUFC against Brentford.
If that goal went in off Toney, Roy Keane would be having a field day
I'd say we got lucky. Other teams would have beaten us in that game. We need more goals.
Squashes? Lol you won 1-0 🤣
Manu + harry kane = league title
United fans going on about Rashford. 😂 your team has scored 2 goals in over a month 😂 get real
we need to keep rashford martial and bruno just let em play
Hopefully Eriksen and Casemiro back together by the end of the month and we can start kicking on in the final stages of the season. They have been a massive loss. More than 25 games missed between them if I'm not mistaken.
well done united sad my team wont be getting top 4 any time soon :(
Does Rashford ever smile? Top footballer but zero personality.
That whole united team are the most over rated lot I've seen
Why shove a suggested video there at the end. Couldn't see what Rashford was doing.
Great shot by Fred 😂😂😂
Correction: Rashford squashes one bee 🐝
Imagine paying £160mill for Antony and Sancho...
Toon fan here .. weghorst is no we’re near good enough to wear that shirt , if use bring in a good striker and another world class dm use will be really good next season .. imagine oshimen up top and like a Declan rice in dm.
I'm so glad I never watched this match. I would have fallen asleep 😅
We need more goals
Footballer little touch.. Ouch that hurt… Ruby player “ Lets play on…Come on bring it on”😂
Disappointing first half for Brentford - too many missed passes and opportunities not taken, but the away support was fantastic and our defending kept the score line from getting embarrassing
Not on really bees are an important part of the ecosystem, I'm disappointed to hear that about Rashy
Step up Harry Kane, missing part of the jigsaw! Even then though probably won't have enough for the title.
I’d happily take Ivan Toney at United
Antony wasted so many chances
Hardly convincing.
McTomminay and Weghorst need to leave.
One more game until Casemiro’s return ❤
Youtube should find a way to not allow the damn recommended supplementary videos cover the damn content before the video is over. Let us finish this one first. So stupid. 😒
I don't like to say it but if we had haaland wed be smashing it.
Love rashford but he's very fortunate to be back onside in the second phase of play for that goal. Completely unaware of his position, too lazy getting back onside, not reading the game. He's not a centre forward. We desperately need one
Dunno why but I loath Brentford , average team who pick up points early and have a striker who shouldn’t be playing
This is a joke of a team , was watching barca real madrid and the quality of the play and mentally of the players from united is years if not centuries behind.  And I blame that on the media hype , only city and arsenal I can compare with the la liga giants and lets see if Chelsea gets Luis Enrique he have the same game play as city and arsenal . And I'm a united fan
I don't agree with the current offside rule. Rushford was offside when the ball was played forward. Surely its an advantage
Lacking goals big time , Eriksen and Casimiro are back next week so hopefully that will change
Flick from Toney at 1:46 was class
Antony had like 4 shots none on target 😭
Can’t wait to have Erikesn and Casemiro back
Antony crossed with he's right foot...so that's something at least 🤯
Antony do Santos... needs to be benched for a long time... he is only playing to show off
I identify myself as a bee and find this caption highly offensive
Title race is back on!!! 😂😂
Rashford goal was offside
I’ve never rated Rashford. He has absolutely 0 vision!!! Just runs until he either trips over the ball or gets tackled. He’s a poor man’s sterling! And those gloves………….🤦🏻‍♂️
Cometary guy made it sound like he was 20yards out ,weghorst could have scored that
McTominay should just play as a striker. He's wasting his career playing as a midfielder.
Great response a proper no.9 goal from Rashy. 3rd spot still is achievable.
He does? How *dare* he! They are endangered, you know; he's such a cruel person!
Why Shade didn't pass to Toney I will never know.
Lucky win for manu 3 shots on target at home 😂 that’s only 4 shots on target in two games .
Not played well since they beat Barcelona
Rashford and Watkins are both in the form of there life's at the moment Could possibly be the front two next year at the euro's ..
Good win but 3 shots against Brentford is actually really bad for a club like man u
Title back on?
Mctominey needs more game time, far better than Fred
It's alright mason will be back next season
Scotty our new striker him and weggy will do the business 😊
odd title but sure.
We cannot play without bruno and rashford
The title is a bit concerning
Rashford should move on to a better club.
Going from a 4 - 0 loss to Brentford to go on to beat them next time around 1 - 0 is a massive step forward for United.
Let's goooo utd and rashford haha great performance and win hmmm haters
Victor osimen pay it united
More goals needed in order to fight for 1st place. New no9 needed asap
completely unacceptable to kill an endangered species
U could tell that after half time, the players either were absolutely exhausted, especially Bruno, because they're playing a game every 3 days, or they just switched off after the 1 goal and didn't bother to try and score another to secure the win
Good win against a Brentford side than lost just 1 of their last 16 league games and drew with Arsenal and beat Man City away this season. Plus Brentford hammered United in the previous game.
BORING BORING UTD
I take exception to the headline on this clip.  Squashing bees is really distasteful. They are becoming rarer every year and if they become extinct it is a serious problem for the future of the human race because without these pollinators our vegetable food won't exist.  🐝
I hope we do sign sabitzer on a permanent deal
This is poor from Man U soo much attacks but a 1-0 win very disappointed with the outcome. This could’ve been well over 3-0
Last time we faced Brentford it was 4-0 to them, winning 1-0 is an accomplishment.
Good football intelligence from Sabizter.
1/7 to finish top 4 thats a wrap.
Still some dead wood that needs to go to really kick on next season……Fred,Maguire,Jones and Weghorst just simply isn’t good enough!!!
great 4-1! aggregate
brilliant performance against one of the European giants of football, a massive one nil win
United need shooting practice shots with intent feel like players getting scared smash em
No one can score except rashford, that’s not good, ever since the battering we haven’t been the same tbh. We need a striker and replace some of the current squad
Well Done Sabitzer !!!! Awesome player so far for us ! The move and the assist wow
Antony was diabolical tonight and since Sancho has returned, he's not impressed at all. Recall Diallo back from loan next season and get a top striker. In the meantime, we should give Pellistri more minutes.
…. And Sky are back to kneeling at the foot of Rashford… yawn
Lol still lost to Newcastle
A rare Antony cross with his right foot, and it created a big chance. So why does he barely ever do it?
All those corners and 1 goal. We need to work on set pieces.
Nice to see the best player in the world score again
Next season we need an utterly ruthless goal machine  like a van Nistelrooy
I watched this game live at OT. I was surprised to see the majority of crowd was muted most of the game. Brentford end were signing and chanting relentlessly 😢
4-1 aggregate
That kid messed up for Brentford
Rashford 🔥 as usual, Sancho since his return has been improving, not good enough yet but hopefully soon he will be a main player in the team
Rashford to united is what kane is to spurs 🤣
Brentford are underrated this is only their 5th loss this season that's only 1 more than city and only 2  more than Arsenal. They deserve more credit.
Only 1-0 is embarrassing lol
Rafshord🤩
It’s all good beating Brentford but don’t forget u got bummed 7-0
My dude TRashford doing what he does
I was in that match 6th row
Thanks for covering the last 20 seconds with thumbnails for other videos, shot from sky
Phew 😥 had leeds villa manu n Newcastle 🤗
Martial did well in this game, way better than Weghorst in any game not sure why Ten Hag has him on the bench 99% of the time
Man utd =One man team.
Rashford is a king
jesus utd are crap every game the opposition gets one on ones and misses about 10 good chances utd are in top 4 by luck nothing else
Because the majority of fans have an agenda against him and are therefore afraid to say this, McTominay was arguably our best player aside from Martinez today, especially in the 2nd half.  Also, considering it was a sudden change, Malacia was excellent. 12m I think? One of our most underrated signings in a very long time.
Fair play to utd got the 3 points but without casemiro and rashford they would be mid table
Well done sky sports for covering half the pitch with ads near the end 😅
Struggling against Brentford... where as Newcastle smashed Aston villa 😂😂😂
apparently they stabbed side foot which is pretty normal was ‘pure technique’..! Hmmm……!
Manchester United wouldn't be were there are in the Premiership or Europa if it wasn't for Rashford, he really is on 🔥
Watched the game live and then caught the highlights😂
Rename Rushford vs brentford
That's just unnecessary now isn't it Rashford,  take your own anger out on something other than bee's. Footballers these days, first the cats now bee's. Disgusting!
Hardly sqashing them with 1 goal
What an atmosphere in what was not even a massive game for united! Never hear the commentators mention our atmosphere though unlike St James' park where they have to mention the atmosphere every 2 seconds ❤
What a goal 💯🔥❤️🇾🇪
How about Rashford takes the honey from the bee's, who said anything about squashing?
who writes these titles lol
yess
Antony appreciation comment 🎉👏👏
the kings return to winning ways
Manchester United rely far too heavily on Rashford.
Brentford still 4-1 up on aggregate this season😂
Well deserved win. Great performance and many close shots. Very proud of you REDS advancing from defeats. We will get to the champions league next season!
When united get a clinical striker and a progressive midfielder, it's going to be very very very scary
Squashing bees never sounds right
We really need a few goal scorers to help Rashford. Kane is a must in the summer for me.
good form is built on 1-0 wins.
Casemiro, we can’t play without him
Why do I get the impression Rashford looks unhappy this season?
Like Manchester rashford is red
Thank god for Rashford without him we don't have an attack now that Garnacho is injured. Anthony and Sancho were dreadful all game. Bruno has been off it too.
That was the best 1st half United performance in a long time. 2nd half was a bit more squeaky which shows there's still work to do. In Ten Hag we trust!
Rashford vs Toney debate still on ?
Rashford savior again thx Rashy
Props to that controlled header from sabi to rashford 👏👏🇪🇬👹
rashford carrying united this season
Is it wrong that as a Chelsea fan i want Rashford to do well and keep scoring but i want United to lose at the same time🤣🤣
Hope Rashford didn't hurt his little cheat toe ! ....
Rashford your celebration never gets old never give up bro 🥺🥺🥺🥺👏🏾
If Rashford was injured, the options to even test the opposition goalie are limited.. Very limited..
I’m no football manager or coach but why Is it with have one of the best shot stoppers in the game but there still trying to force him to play with his feet when it’s not in his game and it’s causing more problems then it’s solving.
Eh! He's NOT a centreforward!!!
Back in the day Rashford would have been called offside for that one…
28 goals and counting
"Squashes" it was 1-0. Which idiot writes these titles?
Lol. Rashford the ghost gets a tap in. Should’ve played against Newcastle or Liverpool. Even Salah (in his worst season) has a higher g/a (or 1 less). ManU fans really do be hyping him up. He!s doing good but still ain’t that good. Shows how low ManU standards are. He got pocketed by Araujo against Barca and only scored when he was injured. Small game player
What would happen if rashford got injured
Can they score a second?? Nope… Ronaldo can however..
Newcastle ⚪️⚫️
Newcastle won against West Ham 5-1. More entertaining game for sure. Newcastle fans are true fans. Unlike Man U fans
Only Rashford looks like a goal threat in the squad. I'd like to see Garnacho get more minutes. Play with a 3 in midfield with Bruno wide right when Casemiro or Rashford unavailable, putting Mctominay as a 10, see if he can be a goal threat. I'd like to see Greenwood be brought back in, he's not been convicted and should therefore be allowed to play, the most natural goalscorer at Man Utd.
Badly needed was painful watching it 3 points and a win need casmerio and Eriksson back. Job done  back in top 4
3 points, we move on, it was only brentaz
Finally man united played a whole 90 minutes without wout Weghorst 👍
I am better than Rushford
We need rashford up front all the time
This is another embarrassing United side. They've been very poor again this season.
Sort your celebration out mate very bore"ng
Despite the headline. NEVER squash bees. Protect out pollinators 🐝
I almost forgot rashford had gone a couple games without scoring till now. Almost seemed like he hasn’t gone a game without a goal scored. He’s had quite the season.
Great finish by rashford but even better vision and control from sabitzer with the header!!
We only won 1-0 but it was great to see us looking comfortable for 90 minutes again.  Everyone done there jobs tonight❤🖤 onto the next!
For all those who keep saying "we ain't much different from last season" this is the difference  No Cas, no Erik and we had to grind out a win
Snorefester United 💤
Pesky bee(s)!
Brentford sleepwalking the whole game. Couldn’t even string a couple of passes together.
Oh yeah let's bring up a link to the Wilson interview so we can't see anything rashford did at the end there...
The point of the offside rule is to stop players from goal hanging.   Yet I've just watched rashford goal hang, miles offside, but get away with it because he wasn't interfering with play.   Somehow the rules have broken.  Where players are once again rewarded for just standing next to the goalkeeper waiting for the ball.   Goal hanging used to be a real problem and the offside rule solved it.   But god knows what the rules are for now? It's a mess.   You can be 50 yards from goal but get stopped by an offside flag for having your kneecap 1 inch offside. Yet you can stand 50 yards offside, SCORE and be deemed not interfering with play.   And for the record I love Marcus rashford and nothing against him. I'm just mad at the rules these days.
rashford is on fire 🔥
Fred could of made it 2
McTominay was great tonight!
Any update on the hype around  the £72 million flop, jadon sancho
GLAZER OUT    QATAR INN
Such a better team without Weghorst
Sabitzer headed bs k brilliantly
You're still not getting top 4 this season 😊
Rashford having the season of his life on 🔥
wasnt confident going into this game, relieved the boys got the job done 💪💪
should be 4-0 against this champ side but will take 1-0
Impressive performance and important 3 points 💪🏾🔴🔴🔴
top 4 cemented
Seriously it was not exaggerating as the title! It was must needed win.
Why do you we keep trying to play them stupid goal kicks ffs so annoying
Love to see rashford and martial together up front again
The swamp are crap
Looks like a lot of very average performances on both sides.
'SQUASHES' Really?
All the rival fans need to realise that Brentford are an amazing side that beat city comfortably - who were at home. This is a good result with better football. The bounce back is on.
One man Marcus Rashford ❤
That's how United should be playing every game in a controlled manner dictating from start to finish. Brentford barely caused us any issues tonight. A much needed win a clean sheet back in the top 4 with a game in hand still now bring on Everton. Best thing is that next week both Casemiro & Eriksen will be back
Love when the suggested video comes up in the last 10 seconds so I can't see anything 👌🏼 still a bit shaky at the back but the attacking play from man u gives me real hope
gg man u!
went to this game and the atmosphere was amazing as usual
Come on united
Rashford eats Bees them for breakfast 😏
This win papers cracks for me because Rashford scoring 90% of utd's goals is not sustainable. Utd need more goals from other attackers if they want to achieve more in my opinion
What is the point in recommending another video and blocking the screen so we can’t see the match we’re watching…
We can’t start weghorst for the rest of the season if we want top 4. We also need to control the game more like this rather than relying on scrappy games and luck.
pretty dull game tbh brentford were too defensively set up, also if they scored that goal it would probs get chalked off with being offside. btu thats the football world we live in now. gg end the season mid table which is still remarkable, and if they punish toney for next year then just stop watching the corrupt sport happily
Top 4 : 1. Arsenal 2. City 3. Newcastle 4. Manu
Absolutely disgusting from Rashford. They're vital for our ecosystems
Did I just see a first time right for cross from Antony? 🤩👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
How did we lose 4.0 to Brentford they are awful
Thanks to sky for putting these short clips on
Although rashford had a poor game sabitzer had amazing awarness to see rashford coming back from an offside position to save the game
Martial > Weghorst
Missed nearly the whole part of that last attack because of the advert you put on it. Gonna stop doing that thanks in advance
surprised half the comments aren’t united fans saying they’re back in the title race
These man are really celebrating losing 4-1 on Aggregate
They need to score more. Happy for the three points but we need that out to kill attitude. That one part of United's game that they're missing.
Sabitzer assist yesss lad
Man Uniteds lack of goals will cost them big time. The goal difference is way too low in the top 6 and are only second best for the top 9. That's shocking
If United can get Kane or someone of a similar ilk, you can see United scoring a lot more goals
first
A LUCKY WIN FOR THE MANCHESTER REDS.
antony pass was class
Ain't got a clue what happened in that last clip 🤣
Squashes the bees? They won 1-0😂😂😂😅😅😅
Wasn’t pretty but big 3 points 🫡
This is so good for villa
I’m sorry but “squashes” threw me off
Our man rashforf at the rescue again
Where did everyone watch the game couldn't find it???
It’s Rashford United lol
Lovely ball from Antony
Mctominay not good enough bruno is a waste off space atleast 6 players gone this summer maguire gone do not know why they gave Luke shaw another contract🙄
All the none English United fans flooding the comments 😂
Mctominay dreadfuk deserved to be dropped, but great management by Ten Haag, told to go out there and prove himself
The shape of Rashford's head 😂
Appalling refereeing, a typical home ref. Couldn't wait to blow the ft whistle. No way only 4 mins added on, at least 6+. Utd diving around, cheating. Unlucky Brentford we deserved at least a draw. Still 4-1 on aggregate 😂😂. COYB
Rashford still doing that celebration like he’s scoring 20 goals a season 💀
Not a pretty win but they all count.
Love not being able to see the highlights at the end because of a link to another video 👍👍👍
Nice cushion header from sabitzer
Job so v a gritty Brentford, MUFC rely to heavily on Rashford to score, a goalscorer, a proper number 9 is an essential signing in summer
Great result man utd do struggle with casamiro in midfield
De gea surely can't remain as united's number one next season.
All these attacks and just 3 shots on target?! We definitely need to have a clinical striker next season.
Such an un-rashford like goal
We spoke to Man U fans after the newcastle game on the new ownership and the top 4 race.   Great result for them this result and puts pressure on spurs!!
Non a convincing performance but 3 points in the bag
Rashford has been in great form. So happy to see him score again after 4 PL games. Everyone played well, we've improved so much since the last time we played Brentford. Old Trafford is a fortress🏰 GGMU🔴🔴🔴
Good win for United & whara even better for them is that they’ll have casemiro back from suspension for game vs Everton, a huge boost
Newcastle scored 5
Most controlled performance I've seen fro  us this season without Eriksen or Casemiro in a team. Solid team performance. Needed that win. 💪🔴⚪️
Rashford😑👈
A needed win today. Hopefully we can get top 4, win the F.A Cup and the Europa League.
Top 5 players of the season:  Haaland  Saka  Rashford  Paulinha  Kane
Lucky mancs
Mctominay was a crucial part in this game without him we could have lost
Degea is starting to annoy me
A 1-0 squashing 😂😂😂
Not the most convincing performance but got the 3 points
Rashy
GLORY GLORY MAN UNITED
Ten Hag wanted a machine, He got Rashford.
A lot more intent tonight from United. We need to keep playing on the front foot 👏🏼
Please SIR Jim!! Make it SO!!! ❤🙏🙏🙏🙏
Rashford starboy
We weren’t amazing today but it was a must get 3 points. We need to be able to get that second goal against teams like these or it will cause problems for us.
Brentford are a great team from where they was to now! Next time Lads!!
RASHFORD IS BACK!
Rashford carrying united once again. This guy deserves the type of contract that Mbappe has at PSG
'sQuAsHeS'  1 - 0 at home
Rashford is so good atm
“Squashes bees” Let’s hope those bees don’t come back to sting you sky as if you squash one their army will attack
Legends ❤
Bad quality
first one here and also that was well quick 👏🏾👏🏾
some player is rashford 🔥
It’s 2023 guys.. think of all the bee keepers you’re offending with that title.
Glory Glory Man utd

Hi
