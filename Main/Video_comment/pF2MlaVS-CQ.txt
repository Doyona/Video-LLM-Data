I used to love your shopping trips to CVD and Target
Tati! In my head you are my Bestie, and I so stoked your moving to be near ME! YAYYYY! We are the same age, going through the same fertility issues, BOTH finally in our dream home, I DO have chickens, and a micro ranch, We both LOVE BEAUTY, FASHION, NICE THINGS - QUALITY THINGS, and our SR puppy is our world!! We are SOOOOO much alike, My family is in Dallas & My Grandma has a historic home in Waxahachie 🥰. My maid of honor (Jamie Maransenbaum)is the leading real estate broker/ awarded Top Producer accolades for Ebby Halliday Companies, the largest independent brokerage in the state of Texas. She specializes in Nort Dallas/ Fort Worth area, Prestonwood and prettyuch anywhere in Dallas! She specializes in High end luxury Real Estate!  Know you have someone in Texas silently rooting for your tiny little family! Your Bestie- Kelli from Houston! 😍🥰❣️
I moved to Texas too without knowing no one. It’s great & so is the square footage on the home 🏡
We are proud of you. I see the change in you
TATI WE LOVE TO HAVE YOU BUT PLEASE DON'T CALIFORNIA OUR TEXAS!! 🥰🥰🥰
Okay the real question is what city ? because each city has its own culture to it. All are amazing ! For I live in Austin, Tx.

I’m in Oklahoma, come visit up here. We’d love to have you. Be sure you know where to go during a tornado, it’s that season now.
You look younger, lighter and more happy. It’s my belief you have broken out of a toxic mindset and habit and “woke up” to your true authentic self. I resubscribed today. I’m not talking about any incident or  “troubles” you’ve had, I mean in total and general.
More vlogs please💕
Omg more of those videos! More vloggs tati, it was so nice to hang out with you! I do love your makeup videos, don't get me wrong but can you do some vlogging too?🥰

Please become besties with LeighAnnSays!!
Wow. What is the Starbucks coffee drink you are having? Looks amazing!

With all the horrible anti-woman-rights laws recently passed in Texas, who would want to move there? :(((
I like the vlogs! I totally get how exhausting moving is 🤪
Welcome to Texas! ❤
"This is my messy closet. It's not very big." Has a freakin room dedicated to her color coded clothes and neat rows of shoes...
Welcome to Texas, I’m in San Antonio, watching you for years, it gets hot, that’s why we have pools. So glad you have one. Live your best life❤️💐💐

I love that you’re vlogging, I love that you’re on a new journey with so many positive vibes in store for you and your hubby. I LOVE that you’re moving to Texas! I love Texas, and like yourself having lived in Los Angeles, I wouldn’t live anywhere else! I love that you’re just you. We all can relate to you! This is life, s**t happens to all of us, and you are an inspiration to your viewers that we can all get to the point of contentment and inner peace.  Can’t wait to see what’s next. xx
My husband wants to move to Texas, however as Canadians I’m not ready to leave the country despite how enticing it is.
OMG!!!!! i’m so happy you are moving here, congratulations whatever yo go you light up, it’s so amazing having you in this amazing State!!!!!!
Welcome to Texas!
Ahhhhh I’m in Texas!, the sunshine is happiness
Yasssssss! 🤩🥳 There’s going to be more vlogs!!! 😍👌🏼❤️
Would love more vlogs like this 🤩❤️
Yayy! Welcome to Texas ❤️🤍💙 We’re happy to have you!!
welcome to TEXAS!! I live in Fort Worth, been here for over 20 years! enjoy! my door is always open for visitors and new friends:) ill make ya a cup of coffee and we can sit out by the pool. xo Shelly Murphy
I would love to see more vlogs. I have to pack my house that I’ve lived in for 20 years now and I’m not looking forward to it. Thanks for being real about the struggle.
love the vlog style from u! (especially all the puka content!) dont just stick to the makeup!
I love vlogs. It's really cool to see what people do in a day, even if nothing really exciting happens. So happy for you, Tati. Moving is always stressful. I'm curious what you think about making a second channel dedicated to vlogs? Not that you have to do that, of course. I've just seen some youtubers use a second channel to vlog while their main channel is used for whatever said youtuber does. Either way, I always enjoy your videos, Tati!
Love, love the vlog!!! Pls pls do more vlogs!! I want to see the new place & follow along with your moving journey!!
Texas is full of friends, you just don't know them yet!!!!
The lighting from your mirror is amazing Tati! Lol ❤️❤️❤️❤️love the makeup look too ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'm so happy for you. I lived in San Antonio, Tx. The best weather and the best state the Lone Star. What part to Texas r u move?
Could watch this content for hours 😍🥰  I'm so happy for you ❤️
Ahhhh!! Welcome to Texas y’all! So happy for you Tati!
Yay! Hope you like it! I moved here too a year ago! Needed to be around like minded thinkers! Red state! Yay
Love this vlog!!! Can't wait to see where you go next!! ❤❤❤
Tati with the FULL BEAT on moving day!!!

Congratulations Tati! Im so exited to move to! I wish you good luch and good vibes! And yes please do vlogs!!!!
❤️ ❤️ ❤️ YAY.   Congrats on your new life adventure in Texas.   I just did a similar move from Massachusetts to Florida.  It was challenging but SOOO worth it.  Excited for you both... Love and light to you ❤️❤️❤️
This is so exciting tati! Texas is so inviting and feels like home right away bc it reminds me of Az
So excited y'all are moving to Texas!! 😊 Hope y'all love it here!

Welcome to Texas !!!
Welcome to Texas!! Finally got around to seeing this video. I am a Cali girl and I will never leave Texas. You'll love it here. ❤️
This was great!  Enjoy your new home in Texas!
Do more volgs! I love this
OMG! You look so different... so depleted without makeup. What a downer.
Sooo good. I haven’t been watching the latest makeup videos to be honest … this is a good change 👍👍👍
I love this content!!!!!
I’m excited for you guys, and safe travels ❤️ Love your Videos
Dear grrl, those do not look like concrete floor-friendly shoes. My feet hurt already!
How do you looks this beautiful at 2am after a full day of packing!? Welcome to Texas!
Good luck with everything tati, fresh start sending you positive vibes
Love to know Tati will be here in my state! Welcome to Texas Tati!🥰🥰
Love this, more of this please 🙃
Loved this video and everything about it you beautiful Texan woman you =) I'm in Arkansas and would love to move to Texas. Not sure it's in the cards for me but still looking for our forever home here in Arkansas it seems. Living small myself right now and sooooo ready to spread out with room for my camera equipment and at-home business is a must so I feel you. Super excited for you both!! I just know Texas will be the best for you both and the lil ones coming too. Lucky woman, I LOVE ME SOME TEXAS!!
Yay!!! I know of so many good coffee spots if you're ever in San Antonio! 😬😆🤗
Yay!!! I know of so many good coffee spots if you're ever in San Antonio! 😬😆🤗
I live in Oklahoma! Get ready for tornado season 😉
I’m in Texas omg!!!!!! This is amazing!!!! I hope and pray to run into you!
The way you said, “no sugar added,” SENT ME. So happy for you guys!
Tati, don’t use the wood hangers for your closet, use the velvet ones, they’re so convenient and sleek
Good luck! Texas would be too much of a culture shock for me. I’m sure Puka will love having a yard to be free in :)
OMG I had a feeling it was Texas!!! I hope you love it!!! I love in Austin and love it so much! Congrats!!
Tati’s moving day makeup = My glamorous special day makeup 💄😅.   To each it’s own but I could never trade LA for TX
So excited for your new journey ! Wishing you all the good things. Moving is hard and stressful so stay calm and it will all be fine. Blessings!
I can't wait to see the new place!  Good luck with everything!
Welcome to Texas!! Hope you love our home state as much as we do. Love the vlogs!
Love love love it
I'm Australian and even from over here I've noticed this trend of American's all moving out of busy cities to Texas, particularly Austin. It's amazing how humans copy each other whether or not they realise it or not.
More of this would be fun! Also possibly moving to Texas! And love those popsicles!! Lol ❤️
Feel free to vlog away all you want, please! We'll love your content, I'm sure!
I looooooove vlogs!!!!!!!!! Keep it up!
I moved to Texas about 8 years ago from Washington - no family or friends in Texas either when I moved. 😂 but it was the best decision I ever made and have never been happier
MORE VLOGGING
Love the make up, always!! But it’s so awesome to see a little behind the scenes ❤️ love you and your personality! Love to see you winning! 🙌🏼
Left California for Texas 20 years ago. I never looked back. I love it here. 🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱
This was a great vlog, took me a while but I finally finished it. Loved the content!
lovely, enjoy.. i feel those texas sunsets, wild horses and flowers growing in your garden..... love it,
I was joking to myself at the beginning of the video like "haha imagine if she's moving to Texas, that would be awesome!" Then bam, Texas. Welcome, we are so excited to have you!
The editing on this is so cute! Excited to see some Texas living content ☺️
WOW!!!
Congrats, you are awesome! Best wishes in your new home.
I knew it!  So excited you’re moving to Texas!  Welcome! Welcome!
Love the vlogging!!!
Not me having a full on dance party while Tati does her makeup 😂
I liked it! Good luck!
Love it......looking forward to more vlogs
Love vlogs!!!! So happy for you and what’s ahead ❤️
LOL I knew she was going to say "Texas". It's very much a whole movement for people from Cali moving here to Texas. Tati, if you see this and you take on ONE piece of advice..... PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't be one of the ones who move here because of things you love, then begin to degrade the area and people who already live there lol. (Trust me, it's a WHOLE issue that's happened in recent years and I'm not at all referring to those who actually want to *improve* things). Best of luck with EVERYTHING! <3
I love this! Best of luck with the reno ♥️ and growing roots in TX!
I live in Texas.  Welcome, Miss Tati.
Love you💖❤️
Yes tati!!!! We love this!!
Going to be cheeky-I would love to see your classy calm self cook and prep meals etc. I am an absolute mess in the kitchen so would love the good example rofl.
Same
Yayyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!
Love this vlogs <3
I left Santa Clarita, CA last year for Texas. I have family 3 hours away but don’t know a single sole where I am. I work remotely and have never met my coworkers in person.  It’s nice learning new areas, new things, and finding your way somewhere different. Before you know if you too will know how to get home from new places 😆
Tati I’m in TX!! I’d love to meet you!! Pooka can have a girlfriend with my Leia. They look almost alike
Love all your videos and prayers for the move
I vote more vlogs. I liked this Tati better even. Happy for you and your new journey and I wish you all the best
Welcome to Texas from a native Austinite(Lake Travis technically) - hope you love our beautiful state!!
Excited for you Tati!! I’m from Texas! If you need a friend, hit me up! 🤠
Yay!!! Welcome to our state!!! You’ll love it here, although, the weather can be weird, depending on which part of the state you’re moving to!!!
This is good.  I'm almost feeling pre-pan (demic) and getting caught up on more fun videos.  Thanks, it's good to be back! 🧏‍♀️
Yay! Welcome to Texas the best state ever!
Welcome to Texas, Tati!
Tati, will you please make another YouTube channel for content like this. I will surely subscribe to it. I love you since the 5 years ago 😍 . Even if there were challenges and you left . We your beloved  TATINATICS are always here.
I love this kinda video... and congratulations to the both of you, and can’t wait to go on this journey with y’all.
LOVE LOVE LOVE! Texas is on our list of potential places to move, enjoy Tati!
Yay! Welcome to Texas!!

Welcome to Texas!! I'm in Fort Worth and I love my home state.  Be safe getting to Texas. Love seeing this type of video.
Yay!!!  So excited about this.
Tati there is truly no place like Texas 🤍 Welcome Home! 🤍
Welcome to TEXAS!!!!  I am a true Houstionian, who now lives in Austin, TX!!!  You will love it here and everyone else is coming to Texas...why not!!!  Before you know it, you will be talking with a twang.  Enjoy the open spaces, the heat(lol), the AMAZING food and of course our hospitality!!!!!!  The nicest people live in Texas!!! xoxox
I moved to TX in December after living in NYC my entire life.  I don't know ANYONE.  So far my family loves it.  Best of luck
love this type of content!!! pls keep it going ❤️‍🔥
Welcome to Texas!
Have you ever had an allergy to a product?
You should do more vlogs like this. Personally I love seeing how people style spaces for inspiration on styling my spaces.
I’m happy for Tati but her “small space” is my actual space lol. Small spaces unite!
You’re not starting from scratch your leveling up I think there’s a huge difference and I’m so proud of your decision to claim the next chapter of your life in the place you want to be.
Go back to california
This video made me resubscribe to your channel. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
LOVE LOVE LOVE THE VLOGS 👏🏻😍
Absolutely more vlogs!
Love this kinda video 😍 Hope your all-things-moving went well
So excited for this!!
I actually love this style of video!  Let’s be real…. We love EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING you post!
Yay! Tati lives in Texas now ❤️I’m a Fort Worthian. Welcome to the state of backward lawmakers and friendly citizens!
Puka’s little “Yehaw” ... 🤣🤣🤣😍
I love this format!!!!
Congrats!!! I will be moving from Washington to the South when we retire. Maybe we'll see you down there <3 Cheering you on back at home. <3
welcome to texas!! it's a great place to clear your head and get plenty of sun lol. hope it can really become home for you guys!!
Nice to see a video that’s not only about makeup. This was a great video! Texas is not for me , but I hope that it works for you and your family. Still enjoying your videos!!!
Good as so many are -lower taxes and common sense politics!
Hey Tati! Loved the vlog style video!!!  I’m getting married in May and I was wondering if you had some more updated bridal makeup suggestions or tutorial. 💕
Welcome to Texas but please built a tornado shelter.
I hope you love Texas.  I’ve lived here my whole life (except for 10 yrs) and love it.  The people are great and welcoming.  Depending on where you are, August is a bugger but that’s why we have air conditioning!!
Yay! I’ve lived here in Texas most of my life. I’ve moved to different places throughout the years, but I have always come back. This is home for me, and I hope you will feel the same way!
I love the vlogs!!!! Please do more! So excited for you and your move. I hope you absolutely love Texas.
I’m here for Tati’s vlogstyle content!
You will love Texas!! Born and raised in South Texas and I love it here. Congrats Tati
I really enjoyed the vlog! Hope the  move went well and you're settling into your new home 🏡
Love this kind of content! Huge congrats on the move! ❤️

Moving is the worst! Just think about all the space for activities at the new place! Can’t wait to see it!
Welcome to Texas Guys  💞 (I'm @ San Antonio)
Get ready for the heat and humidity girl😂💛
So funny I grew up in Los Angeles, moved to Seattle for 7 years, and now I'm in Texas
I loved this!
Love the vlogs !!!!!
That one line you said - how this is your first time moving to somewhere where there aren't friends or relatives AS AN ADULT, is what makes this vlog and your intention to continue to share this experience VERY valuable to anyone who is going through this or will have to at some point. Thank you! I'm glad you feel good about sharing, here for your vlogs, like the way it is edited, too. : )
More vlogs!! Yes! Yes! 😍🤩😍🥰
I've ALWAYS wished you vlogged like this!
Yesssss part 2 and more vlogs like this!

MORE VLOGS! It’s nice getting to just see you live your life plus I am low key OBSESSED with moving blogs and house set ups ☺️
Everything is bigger and better in Texas. ;)
Omg, congratulations Tati, hubby and I wanted to move over there too, just change everything up as you are but we weren't able too. May God bless you and your family 🙏
You're gonna love Texas. That was my 2nd guess. 1st guess Nashville TN
👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
TEXAS!!!!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Welcome ya’ll!
So happy for you!!
I am here for the Tati Vlogs! 💕🤗
Love these types of videos! I actually just moved from California to Texas. It was the best decision I've ever made! I do know a few people here. My hubby was born here and had lived here off and on. But I only know his family. We got rid of SO much, packed it all up, and we're now living in an RV. We were suppose to live with hubby's grandma, but she decided to sell her house. So that changed our plans. But I LOVE it here! It's peaceful, beautiful, and just amazing! We wake up to see deer in the field behind us. They even come up to the RVs and smell everything. We're right by the Guadeloupe river, it's just amazing! So happy for you! Sending positive vibes for you on this wonderful journey you're on. Hopefully you see this lol. 💜 Hugs!
I moved to Texas a few years back and it’s been one of the best decisions ever
More vlogging please
Loved this vlog! Please film more videos like this 🥰 great to see you happy and excited!
That's awesome Texas is where my husband and I are going to move to in the future!
1000% Love this! So excited for you both and the journey ahead!!
Okay so I’m a week late but I’m here for this Tati! I’m so loving your vibe, I’ve missed you!!!! 🥰
Welcome, we live in Texas and love it! You will too.
You said the weather, oh Tati you have a big storm coming 😭
I am sorry but your dog is the star of the video
Love these vlogs !!! I made the move from Detroit to San Antonio, TX 6 years ago with just myself and my kids. Sold my car, most of my furniture and just had a totally fresh start. I LOVE Texas so much and it was the best move ever!! I’m so happy for you and hope it is as positive an experience here as it was for us!!!
Girl...your skin is gorgeous!  You look beautiful without makeup!
Loved this it’s so fun to see you like this. :) I too have been planning my escape from California to Texas. I’m hoping but the end of the year I’ll be in Austin.
Best of luck Tati!!
Love it
Love the vlog!
I loved this Tati!! I would literally watch you every day and never get bored! Keep it up!
yessssss, love this type of video 5000 times more, I just resubscribed because of it!
I love this content, more vlog please
Please do more vlogs! I love it!
Yes keep up the vlogs!! ❤️
What was the color of the lipstick you used its not in notes, only the lip liner and gloss, loved it and welcome to TX 👏 @tati.
Tati, I moved from NJ to Tennessee on a whim 9 months ago. It was the best decision of my life. I wish you the same happiness
Tati moving is a tough job. You gather so many things while you are there and now moving there's a huge seperation that to happen. It's alot. I enjoy seeing behind the scenes but I also don't want to put extra pressure on you. Safe travels.
Welcome to Texas!!! You are going to love it here!
Happy trails y'all! Bless.
Face gorgeous beautiful lady
Glad to see you haven’t seen long time on YouTube 👍🏻
Very excited for you, I love Texas!
Welcome to Texas! Born and raised here and I love it!
Welcome! So happy to have you! Texas is amazing. But don't let everyone know it's greatness! We are getting full. 😉
when you can please do the one brand videos I was getting so many times from those x
Yay for a fresh start! I was born and raised in Los Angeles, joined the Air Force, saw the world and landed in San Antonio. We (my husband and I) were stationed here, but loved it so much that even when I left the AF we stayed here...then the rest of my family followed me. I've heard it said, "I wasn't born in Texas, but I got here as soon as I could," and that really says it all! Be aware, driving here is not like LA...and don't say "the" before the highway number (i.e. "the 405"), it gives you away as not being native lol.
YESSSSSS give us the everyday POV baby!!
Always a professional and great to watch...TY again !
I loved watching this!!
This is the content I LOVE !! Can't wait to see the new place and the new adventures xxx 😘❤️
Love it!

Don't take Democratic Voting with you.
I love the blog format- hope to see more!
Love Any format with your promising future life. God bless🌺
Congratulations!    Let us know if you enjoy the weather in July-September!  haha.  I'm from Houston and it's so hot and humid in the summer.  I moved to VA and love the seasons.   I'm just assuming you are moving somewhere around Austin since that seems to be where people from the West Coast are moving.
I am so happy to see you excited! Loved seeing you a little lighter. You deserve so much happiness!
Absolutely love vlogs! 🤍🙌🏻 we need more!!
Love this!!!!
Those look like communion plates in the background. 😄
Yay! Welcome to the south!! Love from your Louisiana neighbor.

Hello Tati, Congratulations on your new beginnings!!  You truly inspire me!! Hugs🐕
Welcome to Texas!!! So HAPPY to have you!!!! 💜

Good luck to you in your new home, Tati!
Born and raised here in Texas.  You will love Texas and we welcome you and your sweet little family.
WELCOME FROM ATX, TATI! & yes we love the vlogging.
Texas politics are toxic, especially for those of childbearing years.  That being said, I wish you all the best for you and your family.  All of your devotees/subscibers will follow you wherever, whenever.  Please be safe during your travels.
I love this vlog!!! More vlogs would be very welcomed! I hope the move will go smoothly, God bless : )
So excited for your next chapter and hope you find the peace and happiness that you deserve

More “Lifestyle” vlogging … YES, PLEASE! ♥️ Like 50/50 works for me …  Congratulations on the move! 🥂
You're all about that material thing I'm just wondering don't you want to have children don't you want to like have a family like you and your husband and a dog that's what you wanted
Tati!! This is so exciting! WELCOME TO TEXAS! I am a native Texan, I can’t imagine how you must feel to move away from friends and family, so if you ever need anything, someone to show you around, the best coffee, Pilates studios, or just need a friend, you should totally message me! Congratulations on the move! ❤️🤗
Congratulation for the new chapter, Tati. Wishing all the best.
Welcome to Texas!!!
Love this format!
The introooooo
Yay! ❤️❤️❤️
Omg your moving to my state....♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ Texas! You will love it here.
I definitely love the vlog format!! Can’t wait to see your new house!
I'm joining the chorus of your viewers.  I watch because of you. Yes, I do love YOUR makeup videos. But, I stopped watching other makeup videos the day you returned! I did check regularly while you were gone to see if you were back yet as well.  But I love this content too!  I'm excited for you all. I hope you love your new life in Texas. I would also love to watch you play on the piano  🎹    or maybe even see you cooking. So yes I loved this video too.
Best wishes on this new adventure/chapter in life. Would be so fun to just uproot and move somewhere new. I have family in Texas. My uncle is an architect there.
Texas is the place to be!!!! Low taxes, nice ppl& FREEDOM! good luck! & enjoy your new life!
Tati, I’m so excited for your new journey. Welcome to Texas!!! I’m born and raised here. You will love it!!!
Tati, you're doing great!  I can't wait to see your new space!  It's brave of you and James to move somewhere that does not include friends and family; however, I'm sure our technology helps where you can FaceTime your loved ones and keep in touch and live in a space that you have dreamed about <3
Every time I watch a new vid, I am reminded that you really make me happy and I'm so glad you're back. xoxoxo
I really enjoyed this and look forward to seeing your new life in Texas! I live in Australia 🇦🇺 so I would love to a bit of Texas. Thank you for sharing 💖
When people move to red states, I hope they realize what makes them so great when it comes time to vote
More vlogs!!!
Love the blog!!
Woohoo!!  Welcome to Texas!!!  I have been in Texas since 1999 and I love it!!  It’s a big difference from the east coast, but I just love it.  ❤️
I LOVED this format for you! Obviously I love the makeup videos as well, but it was nice to see more insight into your life & it was cute!
Welcome to Texas!
You are going to fit in so well in Texas!  I think that this kind of "Go with me" video is the new trend. I really enjoy them more than anything! I feel like I'm spending time with my friends when I watch this kind of video. Love you anyway! Safe travels!
Congratulations, Texas is awesome!! Blessings over the new chapter in your life! 💞
Loved this vlog Tati…please do more!
Loving the blog and laughing at "living in a box" concept. Current house is bigger than the biggest space I have ever had...or will...🤯😅
I’m just so glad ur back and doing well!!! 🥰
I think a lot of us always wanted more of these type of vlogs. You would put one up occasionally but didn't seem to want to do more. It's nice seeing you are more than makeup. Years ago you did a watch us decorate for Christmas I still remember that one 😁
Love this and love you!! so glad for you!!!
Loved this!  Little bit of makeup, little bit of life. Perfect!
All movement is good Tati! Wishing you both the very best in your new digs. Hugs from Singapore!
I really enjoyed the vlog!! I'm excited to see the new chapter
Tati I love this kind of content - makes you so relatable and 🤩. The vlogging is funny and I totally get the whole moving chaos thing - we moved (move number ??? Must be 10 at least) and it was carnage lol. I absolutely hate moving - it’s such hard work and I always swear I will never move again!! There must be an easier way to do this. Anyway - can’t wait to see more vlogging content and for you to share yr exciting journey to Texas !!! XOXO 😘
This new format is great
Love the vlogs!
Love the new beginning for you Tati <3
💖💖💖💖💖
You said Texas and I laughed out loud, I honestly figured you would say it. It seems like so many people are moving to Texas. Best of luck on the move and enjoy being in a new space!
I knew it!! I live in Texas and I could just feel it. You will LOVE it!
❤️♥️❤️
Happy to see you’re doing good and seeing your relationship with Christ grow day by day. You’ve had some frustrating seasons and some hard times lately, but it’s only pulling you closer to Him and reminding you that you are not alone & your relationship with Him is more important than anything else in this world. Hoping this new move to Texas will be a great thing for you and praying you find an amazing solid church right away and find great long-lasting friendships there. Would love to see a video on your Faith journey whenever you feel ready to share.
I didn't even have to watch this to know it was going to be Texas.
Texas DEFINITELY makes sense…
Tati we definitely want more vlogs!!!! And congrats for the new home!!! <3
I’ve lived in Texas my whole life, welcome! ITS HOT😂
OKLAHOMA is so much better than Texas! Lol!
I was born in Cali and now have lived in Texas for most of my life! It’s a breath of fresh air, I promise you! Southern hospitality is so real 😄 And loooove the vlogs, more please!
So excited for you guys!! You deserve so much happiness!! ❤❤ TEXAS!! 🎉🎉
Wish you all the best for the future. Please do more vlogs.
So enjoyed this 😍
I live in Commerce Texas...about 1 hrs outside of Dallas to the east
Loved this! Yes I’m the blogs. Such fun content
Love a good Tati vlog!!!!
I am loving seeing Tati vlog!!!
Welcome to Texas. You seem like a DFW/ Arlington area woman. I hope it’s not Houston. Austin is okay but we really don’t own them, they are a different breed. I’m close to Louisiana, but have lived all around Texas. ❤️✌🏼
Now that you’re movin’ here, you hafta learn how to say “Y’ALL” instead of “YOU ALL” or “YOU GUYS”. 🤣👍🏻 Welcome to Texas!🇨🇱🤠
Love this vlog style!
I guess I missed it. But why did she move to the townhouse in the first place?!?!
So awesome Tati! I’m a fan that lives in Texas!! Welcome to my home state! The heat might be something of a shock but I love it!  So many beautiful places in the state and the food is absolutely amazing. My family owns land in the hill country and it’s something that is  a gem! Hope you will love it!
I like the Vlogs. Do more of them.  But never give up the makeup videos. your make up videos are the best! Many Blessings on your new adventures in Texas! Thanks for sharing!
Loooove this!!!
Welcome to Texas Tati... we're glad to have you!!!
Definitely loved the vlog, dont stop please!!!
Tati!!! What’s your sbux drink?!?!?
Ahh Tati! I’m from San Antonio! If you need to meet up with fellow believers, let me know! 🥰
I love Tati vlogs!! Can’t wait to come along the moving train with you! These are my favorite types of videos love seeing the behind the scenes real life stuff too!! ❤️❤️❤️
I love the vlogs we need more. Can't wait for more
Yea! Your are moving to Texas...my home.
Ooo I love this vlogging Tati so much! I’m here for it ❤️
You’re so brave to do this move. Congratulations on your new adventure.  Loved hearing James voice again, I hope someday he wants to come back into videos.  The pacific NW will miss you 😘❤️❤️❤️
Love it 🥰
👏🏻👏🏻🥰
No one cares, secret invert! 🤭🤫🤭🤫🤭🤫🤭🤫🤭🤭
I love blogs it shows reality
Love this, congratulations!! We need more james I miss him. Yall together is the freaking best.
I’m so happy for you guys!! You look so beautiful and happy! I wish you the best of luck. Safe travels! You will meet so many people that will love you! I enjoyed the vlogging because it reminds me more of your personality! ❤️🙏🥳
My family has lived in Texas since before Texas was even a state! Glad to welcome a new member to this great state! Also can’t wait to give you suggestions of all the places to visit: H‑E‑B, Buccee’s, whataburger, etc..
So exciting Tati! I’ve lived in the the east, the west, the north but Texas is my favorite. Welcome! In general people are nicer.  If you need to create some goodwill and blend with the locals just talk about how much you love H‑E‑B. It’s an underground Texas cult.   I wish it was houston! I seriously need some humidity proof makeup videos in my life and ya know humidity is great for the skin.. just saying
Loved this format!!!!!
Tati so excited to see your new home! I ❤️your vlogs! Please do them more often!🥰
Omg where in TX!??? Im in Katy TX 😊
Texas is a strange strange land. I enjoy visiting!
I’m happy for you, but I’m curious. Why Texas?
Girl friend do your thang I'm here for it, do you! and congrats on the exciting new journey and I hope you had a safe trip getting you and everything there in one piece cause moving is a B*tch
Welcome to Texas!
Love these clogs!!
I just watched this … makes me sad you’re moving to Texas when I just moved from there 😰
Yess girl
I am happy..
Ih I live in a studio in the Bronx
More vlogs please
Love the video
When are you releasing music ?
I just bought the sigma pallet with the greens in it from their website! I didn’t know they’re ad target now! I’ll be going to get the other ones now!
Why did i get pregnancy vibes from you in this video? I mean this in the most nice way because i know you guys are trying but i say this from the most positive way. My gut just told me that over and over while i watched your video from being tired, to saying daddy to James and mom to yourself with Puca (i am too a fur mama so i get it but it just felt different) I also ate a lot of popsicles in my first trimester so idk 😭 and the few times you blanked out a little. This could all be from exhaustion but I thought I’d mention it. If not then I hope you get to become a mama soon! All the best to you and your family and good luck!
First video I've watched in years, I may consider re-subscribing as this is the type of content I love! 💗
How fun
I don’t follow you for make up, I love real life every day content. I have moved 14 times so I all for this type of content. Enjoy your new home
LOVE this! So happy for you guys, and so excited to hopefully get to come along the journey with you (or should I say ya’ll) ! Thank you for sharing!
I too left Seattle right before the pandemic. Currently in Austin and loving it 💕💕
Welcome to Texas! We are happy to have yall!
I had this gut feeling you were going to say Texas! Welcome to the Lone Star state! I’ve also got a gut feeling you’re going to be in DFW area, you’d definitely fit in there very well!
How did I know you were going to say it’s Texas! It’s awesome 🧡 good choice. Best wishes on this new chapter!
Do more vlogs!! Love it!! You will love TEXAS...born and raised...it's the BEST!
it was so easy to watch, so nice I didn't even notice the video was about 20 minutes ♥
I really enjoyed this Vlog and would love to see more of this journey! Pretty soon I'll be moving to a new house for the first time in my adult life to somewhere I've never lived before and I get overwhelmed just at the thought of completely packing up and moving everything. Having this kind of content to watch would sort of feel like I've got a friend that is going through the same thing!
I love this vlog!! ❤️
Woohoo, more vlogs Yes Please!!! 👍🏻👏🏻❤️
I'm assuming Austin?
Hello from Texas! We will welcome you with open arms! I am born and raised in Dallas, TX and will never leave. The food is good, people are friendly, lots of space to start a family. Not much more you need in life. ♥️
Welcome to the Lone Star State!  So many things to see and do here.  We measure distance by hours not miles.  Enjoy and ready to hear more
i feel like you are Texas. This is going to be great !
I’ve always loved your videos and enjoyed your content (for 5+ years), but this is the first time I can relate 💯 to everything you’re doing and feeling/talking about. It’s wonderful 💖💖💖
YOU are an inspiration girl!!! So down to earth and personable!  All the best to you Tati, from NJ!
Honestly loved the vlog x I feel like your so much more naturally comfortable with this relaxed style x look at you go! Keep them coming 🥰💕
Love the vlog and I am excited to watch what comes next for you and James. <3 Also, I enjoy watching your videos, but I just don't wear makeup like I used to. Mostly because of the pandemic, but also I am 56 and makeup just doesn;t seem as important as it used to be. So you starting to branch out beyond makeup makes me happy :)
This outro is getting messy 🤣  You were giving me major Kate Beckinsale vibes in that lewk you gave us! 🤩💗
I love your makeup videos! 😭
Love this way more than just makeup Tati you are lovely as a blogger. ❤️🇨🇦
What happened to the LA home?
Welcome to Texas….I love my Texas
1 Million % more vlogs. Loveeee this side of Tati.  All the best on your new adventure 💗💗
Blog
Love this the best!!! Thank u for the vlog
Definitely love this vlog style!!!  Im not saying you should suddenly ignore your safety or anything (obvs that still has to be paramount), but I think being more open with your audience will be lovely for us but also healthy for you - the only way to feel unrestricted is to take down some proverbial walls, let people in. You know that in your heart, I think.  The time has never been right until now but this is a new start and you’re miles and miles away from the danger zone now. Life starts again, here & now - and it’s going to be truly truly wonderful!!! Much love x
WELCOME TO TEXAS, girl. I am soooo excited your coming to my neck of the woods. I LOVE IT HERE! Been here my entire life :) Now get ready to be hotttt! I hope you have 2 or more air conditioners. Your gonna need them all .... I promise if I realize where ur living I will keep it hush hush. Promise! MUCH LOVE! xoxo
Anybody else seeing that light and positive energy coming back in Tati? 😍 I’m here for it!!
Yes absolutely more vlogs 😊😊😊🙏
I love the vlog format + a bit of makeup. Been watching your channel for a while and its nice to see parts of your everyday life. Excited for you!
Oh my gosh, Tati!! Welcome to Texas!♥️
I wonder if you’ll like the politics and politicians in and from Texas…😬
Love this for you! Prayers for a great new beginning! 💜💜
Life is a journey, and it’s not all about makeup, etc.  I love the vlog format, and less makeup.  Wishing you a successful move in.  You deserve some happy in your life.  Grab it while you can.  You have one life.  Make it an adventure!  🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏
Congratulations Tati!!! So happy for you and your new life chapter. Onward and upward and YES 🙌🏼 more vlogs please 🤍
I would KILL to live in the place you think is a box, haha!
I love this for you ,
Wanna see a new home tour yesssss 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 loving these kinds of videos
Yes more vlogs!!
Love vlogs ❣️❣️❣️❣️
I love vlogs
I love these types of videos. Wishing you happiness in your move
I moved twice in 9 months.  Spent over $1000 just on boxes.  Good luck with all your packing.
Are we not showing James anymore?? And does he have long hair now??  Just observation from the car.
Love the format really fun and great to watch would love to see more x
I already knew it was Texas seems like everyone is moving there!
Girl just come over the Cascades there's plenty of sunshine on the east side of Washington and lots of land for having horses. It's only like the coast area that's Gray.
So excited for you! I live on a huge ranch and there’s just something about drinking coffee on your back porch and seeing cows, bison, deer, etc. Puka will love it too! Personally, I like this content. I love seeing moving vlogs and house Reno’s. Whatever you decide, as others have already reiterated, we watch your videos more for you than the content.
Love love love ❤
❤️
You’re welcome to Texas, just please leave your West Coast destructive politics in the West Coast!
Yaaaayyyy!  Welcome to Texas! 💜
Yay excited for your move to TX. I’m born and raised in TX. You’re going to love it ❤️
Puka’s yeehaw got me 😂 🤠 I totally understand you seeing nervousness in Puka with the moving. My two cats didn’t really eat for 2 days while we were moving last summer. I was like “don’t be sad! We are moving to a bigger place for you!”
Welcome to Texas!!! 💖 So glad you get to start a new chapter here!
The mini panic attack i had while you ate the purple ice pop in a white hoodie 😂😂 Love this vlog style (the screen edits the music just everythinggg *Chefs kiss* 😍😍)
Texas!!!!  Yes!!!  Welcome home!!!!!!  I can’t wait for you to explore this beautiful state!!!!
Please reuse all the plastic later :)
I am so excited for you guys! Also, this type of video is my absolutely favourite! Wishing a safe journey and move! 💜
Yayyyy I want more Tati vlogs!!!! ❤️❤️❤️🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
I LOVE seeing this side of u Tati! U be you and don't care what any negative people say because there's not ONE bad thing I can think of when it comes to you!! You got this :)
Yes! More vlogs! So excited for you.
Oh girl living the military life we move every 3 years not knowing anyone sometimes across the world ! Enjoy the adventure!
Love this format.
Austin, Dallas, Houston????

Fun to watch more please
Absolutely love the format! More vlogs please!! Congratulations Tati and James!!!
Happy for you Tati and James 🤍🤍🤍 Love the content
More vlogs!!!!
Welcome to Texas!!!!!!!!!!!!
that beauty blender foundation is one of my top 3 holy grail foundations...it's magical!!! they better never discontinue that!
Drop dead gorgeous inside and out. Love this type of video
it comforts me to know im not the only female that has more makeup that ill never in my life ever wear and the same with heels, I have a closet full of heels that I have bought because I love them but dont even leave the house anymore to wear them. I live in a pair of army green nike slides. We used to go to the military ball ever year and Mardi Gras balls, but none of those have happened since 2019, so I have worn heels once and that was for my anniversary last year when we went to dinner
Everyones loving the vlog but I am loving the soundtrack! Your editor rocked this, Tati 😍
I'm so excited for you and your Journey. I live in Texas so welcome
I wish u green grass, blue skies and sunshine ☀️🌸💓
Everything is better in Texas. Welcome y’all!
Love the vlogging 💕 suits you. No make up fresh as a daisy look is so nice on you 😘 would love more content like this ❤️ x
Her home that she's moving from is so nice. Her closet is huge to me!!! She's used to living in very luxury living but to most of us Her current home is gorg😍
I HOPE YOU'LL VISIT ONE DAY IN THE PHILIPPINES 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭 CHRISTIAN FAN HERE  MAHAL KITA 😍
Tati vlog is what we've been waiting for!!! More vlogs Tati ❤️❤️❤️
Good luck in the new chapter. Hello from Ukraine. Thanks for the distraction :)
So happy you're moving to Texas! I think you will love it here! ♥
we love tati we just loce
It’s be so cool to see you visiting NM! The balloon fiesta is so fun!!! I’m also really glad you and James are still together! And I hope you do more vlogs!
ONE OF YOUR BEST VIDEOS . .  EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  THANK YOU.  :  >
Welcome to Texas!
I’m so happy for you guys 🥺♥️ moving to the state I’m moving to! I love Texas so much!
Congratulations on your new home!  Loved this video.  Whatever you do is great!
Did she say where they’re moving to?
Love it!! Also did not know you are from Seattle!!
Cannot wait to hear what part of Texas you are coming to.  I promise you will love it, may be a little warm but you will get used to it. It’s just the best place in the world.  We have it all, from cowboy boots to spike heels.  We are a bit conservative which I hope you like.
Oh I miss you Tati!! I have been watching you when you have less than a million subs. Seems like it was yesterday but also seems like the longest time. I live in Texas and I love it here sooo much!! I knew you were going to say texas actually lolllll. Welcome home Tati, James and Puka!
I know make-up is your jam but you look beautiful and fresh faced without it🙂🇨🇦
Just did a ~ week vacationin Austin! Def a slower pace than a big city like LA or Seattle, but the weather is amazing, and am so excited for your next chapter in life Tati!
I like this video and would love to see glimpses of your new life in Texas.  You are more than just makeup, so it would be great to see more.  Good luck on the move. I had no idea you lived here.  I live in Washington and am thinking of moving to Texas so this is perfect.
Love the blog idea. Refreshing 👍👍
Welcome to the Lone Star State, Tati!! I am a Texas girl, born and raised!! So glad I'll be sharing a state with such a beautiful soul!! I can't wait to see where this journey takes you!!
😘😘😘
WELCOME TO TEXAS, TATI! peace, love, & buc-ees xoxo
Welcome to Texas!!! I’m from Dallas and love my hometown!
So excited for you. Want to see some James too
Enjoyed this format.
Wow, congrats, Tati and James. Wish I could move there too, from Michigan!!!
East Texan here!!! Woooo come on down yall
Love this! You could be more like what Raw Beauty Kristy did and do more lifestyle stuff
Be prepared for hurricane season it’s starting soon but it depends on what part you’re living in, and the wind is something else and the rain, it rains like crazy here. It gets really hot here.
Love the vlog. But the question I have is for James. Is he going to start routing for a Texas baseball team? I mean I understand the Dodgers when in LA. But a Texas team?
Welcome to Texas. Hope i meet you some day.
Love this so much!!! So excited for this new chapter for y’all!!! ❤️❤️❤️
I’m a native Californian, living in Fort Worth. Your faith will grow to infinity. The best is yet to come for you and your husband. Abundant blessings from God are in store for you, beyond anything you could have ever imagined.
Love blog type videos now. I’ve found myself watching vlogs over just makeup tutorials/reviews lately.
No one wants to live in the blue states any more! Haha. Can't blame ya!
You can do this.  Plus you have your sweetie and your dog.  I moved from Ohio to Florida having no job, and not knowing anyone.  You can do this!
Lucky 7 and 11!  Meant to be!  My husband and I moved from California to Austin TX, 14 years ago. We didn’t know anyone, and it’s still the best decision we’ve ever made.
Is she still married
Love the vlog style!
Yayyyy vlogs! I'm excited for you, for your journey! Happy moving! Have more popsicles! Lol 😆
It's always so refreshing seeing people change their lives for the better, I hope your new journey is the best one! <3
Luv the vlogs!
Love it! You are so beautiful! Your skin looks so Amazing!
Can’t wait to see wots next for you Tati, wonderful things ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🎉🎉🎉🍀🍀🍀
There seems to be a mass exodus to Texas. I've been there a few times. It's a beautiful state. Congrats on your move!
I really loved this video Tati ☺️ xXx
Wonder why James hasn’t been in any videos lately? Or maybe I just missed it.
This video made me smile BIG for you. Yes, more vlogs like this.
Love this feels a little more personal and I love
Again, I looove this content. Lots of people do makeup, Tati. Granted, you are a pro with mad skills at it. But the reason people watch is you. Not everyone is relatable and likable. It’s not just about the makeup with you. It’s who you are. It’s also about being real, like the rest of us- falling down (like all the way flat down on the floor and admitting it) and standing back up. It’s mixing grace with gratitude and not taking yourself too seriously. It’s about not being afraid to say, “ Dude, this is really, really hard.” And doing it anyway. And now, it’s about a new start and claiming your own path to happiness. Best of luck on your move! Bring us with you!
Welcome to Texas!  It’s the best!!
It’s so weird to see you filming in places I recognize, like the Target and Home Depot because I live in the same neighborhood. I’ll not say where. But yeah. I wish you well in your new neighborhood. You deserve so much happiness!  Texas is very different from Washington.  I had considered moving there myself but the politics there aren’t my vibe. So I’m staying in the Seattle area where I pay way too much for my condo because the cost of living is crazy.  Stay safe on your journey. I wish you only the best 💜💜
I think out of everyone who does vlogs, you outdone them at first try 💖 Please keep them coming, sending love & support your way 🥰🌸
Please do bring us with you! I found you and you were my BFF after two major surgeries last fall. It helped me so much and I am actually getting pretty darn good at make up now because of you! Want to watch your journey! Thank you for how much of yourself you give to your viewers.
Loved the vlog! You are amazing ❤️
Welcome y’all! Born and raised Texan here. Couldn’t have picked a better state, imho 😊
Wow loved the sneak peack into your world!more vlogs please
Good luck with the big move 👍🏻 and we need more vlogs please
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I can’t freaking wait for more vlogs 🥳😍🥰 also, very very excited for you 💛
♥
I absolutely adored this video/ format!

Change is good for the soul Tati! I was born and raised in California and move to Seattle, WA when I was 30 with my hubby, two teenage girls and two elementary little ones. We knew not a SOUL on this part of the world!! But this is totally home for me. Even though California would be so much better for my health. I have Fibromyalgia.
Love this!

Yes please turn into a vlog queen ❤❤❤
Love this vlog content! Also welcome to Texas, I hope you love it here!!💖

I get extremely anxious when I watch ppl moving. I moved last year and had brake downs nearly every hour. But I'm so happy you moving I would love to go to Texas one day
Loved this Tati!! Please more vlogs. So glad that you’re back. You were the first ‘YouTuber’ I really got into so it means so much that you’re back xx
I hope you have a portal to portal move.  Moving is one of the more stressful things we do.  This too shall pass.  Best wishes!
Stay safe and I pray for the best in your new state! Luv ya Tati 💙 It has been such a journey in itself watching people I subscribe to move such as Lauren Mae, Michele Wang, Theresa is Dead, Angelica Nyqvist and now Tati as well!

Welcome to the best state in the country and for the love of God and all that is good PLEASE do not vote blue!
I'm so happy for Tati and her husband! This is awesome, she's had a wild journey and now Texas makes sense for them. Bless you guys 🖤
Yes, and vote republican.
While I respect James not wanting to be filmed, it’s so nice to hear him with you and seeing you both on a new journey. Who else misses James in Tati’s videos? 🙋🏻‍♀️
Welcome to Texas! You’re going to love it here.  It’s good to see you getting your “spark” back. Wishing you and James much happiness.  BTW Buck-ee is a beaver. It’s a Texas thing! You may have already figured it out. You can’t beat the bathrooms as you travel through Texas.
We will be thrilled to have you here in Texas XOXOXOXO and you’ve got to switch from “you guys” to “yall” asap 😜
Welcome to TEXAS!!!! Hope to see you around!!!
The 🍍 outshine bars are the absolute best… just do it! 🤣♥️
I’d like to move to Texas honestly, in Ca now, but we’re heading to Florida.
I miss ur vlogs & am so happy that y'all are moving down south! -xo
I loved it! Also I love those outshine bars as well 😂
Congratulations!!  Love the vlog!  I really enjoy all of your content.  We are considering a big move to TX.😬
Welcome to Texas!! So excited for you! And we're ready to welcome you home 💕
Loved this! Oh my goodness I can't believe you have so much make-up! Can't wait to see your journey, congrats!
WE LOVE VLOG TATIII😋😋😋
❤️❤️ thank you for thinking of us as friends/family❤️❤️
I can totally see you point on not wanting to do a home tour and show everything in you home! I’m sure it was/is scary for others to see everything!
What city in TX are y’all moving to? Such a cool video!
Like this format I know you can't say where you're moving specifically, but I'm in Houston and if you'll be anywhere close, would love to welcome you to Texas!! I'm a native Texan but still have a hard time with the heat and humidity - LOL! But, the REAL people make it so worthwhile. Welcome and best of luck to you and James!
So exciting.  I love having my horses in the backyard.  I didn’t know anything before hubs brought one home one day. After 21 years and  having loved five beauties I’ve learned so much. I know it’s a privilege and a lot of work but I wouldn’t trade it for anything.  It’ll be good for you to share your world outside a cosmetic palette Tati. 😉 Good Luck!  Better get used to spiders.  They like to hang out in barns.  😂
Move to East Texas and we can be ✨ best friends ✨
YAYYYYY!!! I had a feeling. You’re going to love us, Texans!!!
I love Tati vlogging and I miss James 🥺 it felt good listen his voice 🤧 I miss Tati & James together in front of the camera, hope you guys make more videos together 💗 I wish the best for both in this new chapter in Texas 🤗
Welcome to Texas!🥰
AHHH i totally knew you were gonna be moving to Texas! ATX i hope!
I dont know where in texas you’re going. But I’m excited you’re coming to the homeland!!
Welcome to the south!!
Tati we would watch ANYTHING you make… just saying!
So excited to see the process !! Good luck tati!!!
Ugh I’m so sad ! I’ve loved seeing you around Seattle. It’s actually funny, I’ve been in coffee for 6 years and throughout my whole journey, you or James have come to every coffee place I’ve worked except the cafe I manage now! Very silly to think about!!! Texas is so beautiful, but Seattle will miss you!!
Random question why can't I find a blendiful by tati? Did I miss opportunity to purchase?
Yaayyy!!!! Welcome to TEXAS 🎉🎉🎉
Good for you!!! So happy for new beginning!
Hopefully near Austin!!!  It’s amazing here. Texas is full of love - welcome!
Welcome to Texas! If your in the San Antonio area come to Castroville,Tx and see me. 😜 wide open spaces for sure.
I think you will love it for a while....but I sense you will miss being closer to your family...UNLESS, they move too!!
You are such a treasure ❤️
More vlogs and a new house tour would be amazing!
Welcome to Texas! Hey Siri, play Wide Open Spaces by The Dixie Chicks!
Yes!!!! You will be in my state!!! There so many amazing towns!!! Hill county is GORGEOUS!!!!!
TEXAS!! Yay!! Been here all my life...WELCOME!!
Loved this! An adventure for you and James- here for it!
Tati,  Congratulations on your move to Texas. My daughter & her family live in San Marcos & it’s really beautiful there.  I also watch several influencers that also live in Tx. Lisajmakeup is one of them & I notice that you reviewed her lipstick & I believe you even used it in your moving video. We’ll back to your big adventure I wish you the very best in everything you deserve it. 🧚‍♂️💕🧚‍♂️
So excited for you, Tati! Love this style of video that isn't JUST about makeup. I'm personally less into all makeup focused videos and more info a variety of lifestyle stuff and just life in general.
Texas is the best 👌 it's not even a comparison
You got this
Yeah tx not to big I’m sure I will see you soon
Best Tati video! Good luck with the move!
I’m soooo excited to watch this process!
Just wanted to say I can't wait for the next parts💕😍😍😍💕

Welcome to Texas!! I have lives here 44 years if my life, which is all of it! If you need advice on places to go, happy to help! 😘
I miss my home state! Welcome to Texas Tati! 🥹🤍
You can hire me Tati I love organizing hehe. I hate packing but I love organizing😁
This whole video is just LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE!! I had to sit down and watch it with my daughter on my lap and document the whole thing and my reaction/commentary of it with my iPhone, because this is such a big moment and we get to learn SO much amazing stuff! I'm SO happy and excited for the three of you!! ☺️  Also, that makeup tutorial part was extremely beautiful and skilled! I see that you have figured out how to match that strong ring light with those Arri film lights! 🙌✨
My family and I moved to Texas in December of 2016. In February of this year we upgraded and I’m happy now. I don’t think I can move again but if We find the Right House we will move again. It’s exhausting.
You are a beautiful women Tati and to me you guys are a sexy couple with a beautiful love for each other
Yessss! Love this 💕
OMG PUKA 😂 “YeeHaw”. LOLLLL Congrats Tati. Blessings on your new move🙏🏻♥️😊🙌

Love this ❤️
I’m in houston!!! I’ll be your friend!!
Glad you never gave up, Thank you. I feel like I've been stuck picking up pieces of a life I didn't want. Now, it's just my boys and I. Me watching what you post, is me getting away from reality before bed. Thank you thank you.
Congrats on your move.
I want to see vlogs about renovations
Congratulations on the move. I loved living in Texas,  I hope you enjoy your new state. Love the vlog as well. Those outshine popsicles are favorites in our house as well.

No self respecting woman would choose to move to that misogynistic,  draconian,  abusive to women in law state.
I 💕 love me some Tati .. Better not vanish again. You bring joy in just nothing vlog.. Be safe moving
I am in NC you are much closer to me now
I like the new format! Real life plus beauty! Love you Tati and all the best for your new start!
Would love to see a part 2! Glad you are taking us on your journey!

When i was 19 years old i moved to philadelphia knowing not a soul there. 2.5 years later i couldn't get back home fast enough. However Texas sounds like an amazing move for you. Good luck ! Love u. P.s. outshine juice pops are the BEST!!!!
Cheers to your new life
Yas go flip Texas 🥰!
<3
We moved to Texas in June of last year, and we love it. Houston is just a lovely city.
I miss James!! We need an updated video from him on current favorites (for my hubs)
Genuinely, could be your best video ever. I realize there has been/is a market for those super glam, celebrity style content but it misses the mark usually. I'm too old and busy to spend my time watching YouTubers show off their crystal covered tumblers.
Hi lovely vid, Texas feels like a great fit for you!
Texas is a whole new world, and an amazing place to grow new roots! Congratulations you two, here's to new beginnings, and best of all, FREEDOM!
Yay Texas!!!! I’ve been here since 2012 and I love it!!!!
Yes! Yes! Yes! More vlogs! Love your Maltese! From Seattle to Texas, Big difference in weather.  Safe travels! Love you, Tati!
Have so much fun!!!! the weather will be so much better, and you'll have such a nice time making new friends in a really differently paced environment.
I love Texas! I’m here now with my Daughter in Galveston area!  My here for my #10 Grandbaby!  It was a Boy!  They have 2 boys and 2 girls
Best wishes Tati!

This felt like chatting with a friend so yessss to the vlogs
Love this type of video/format!!! 💕
Okay like music lowkey slaps on the 7 min
I'm so happy for you two 💗 💓 ❤️
I’m so excited for your new chapter Tati, I’m about to start a new chapter as well AND I’m purging stuff from my house so this video resonates with me ❤️ I would definitely love more content like this but tbh I’ll watch anything you post, Tati fan forever 😘
I freaking knew you were coming to Texas! All of California is lol. But I like you and James, so come on over! You realize you’ll have to share your first pair of boots and hat with us! Aaawe welcome Tati and James! I’m o happy to have you in my home state! 🤠 🥰

Yes, love vlogs. It's real. Less polished. Love the makeup content too. Are we ever going to see James again?
Hearing James voice made me so happy! I wish the best for you both!
Loved this. It’s fun watching your journey!
Ooooooh if you’re moving anywhere near Angelica Nyqvist, y’all should collab! She just moved there too! Tati and Angelica are my 2 fave beauty influencers 🥰
Love this format!! Do more with make too! 🥰🥰
I knew it was going to be Texas. Well hello neighbors!
Excited for you and your journey post everything !!!
You look so pretty with your hair up in a ponytail! You should wear it like that more often!
So happy for you!!! Please do more vlog style videos!!!
I always envisioned you living in a mansion lol this townhouse is the cutest!!!
I like lifestyle too..i don't always watch make up stuff because I just don't use it often but if I do I check ur channel first for review. I would really love too get updates on your life in texas.
This is great!…Can’t wait to see the process and journey of your move!
I want vlogs. I love it.

Yess!!! We want home renovation vlogs & videoa from Tati ❤️
I think most people would be happy with that apartment / town house and the size of it, here in Europe we pay for 70m2 apartments like 200.000€ soooo it really sounds funny when you are not happy with a 2 story town house 😂🙉 American problems right 😭
I am so so excited for this new chapter of your life!!! And absolutely loving the vlog!!
could someone tell me what happened to the house in LA with the perfect studio made by Mr.Kate??
Loved the vlog!
Lol congrats on your move. Women no one in gods name should need that much makeup I know it’s hard to let go.
I’m a Texas girl, live in the panhandle.. people down here are friendly, so welcome..
Yes yes please do a part 2
Yay! Welcome to Texas! It’s such an amazing state! The culture and the food here is unbelievable!
God bless on your new adventure.  Thanks for sharing with us.
Tati is coming to Texas🥺 my heart is so happy for you.
More vlogs!! I’ve always loved your content, but I’m not in to makeup that much! So, I enjoy being able to see different content!
Born and raised Texan here. I live in central Tx in fredericksburg. It’s a must to visit….total tourist town but it has good food, shopping and wineries galore. Save travels!
You are going to love Texas 🤠❤️🤠 just bring your friendly self on down here and enjoy our State.  Just remember we are a red state and don't try to change our ways to what you are moving from.  Most people here will be friendly and welcoming if you just keep it simple even if they don't realize who you are🤗🤠🤗  I love the vlogs , keep them coming. Have a blessed day and a safe stress free move. I will say a prayer for you.❤️
More vlogs!! Love this style video. Best wishes and love to you!
Keep vlogging!!!!
I love this format so much more. It’s more personal and personally a lot more of your personality comes through. You are beautiful inside and out. You will love Texas! I used to live there myself. God bless you and your family (husband and fur baby).
Me in michigan hoping that she would be coming here 😂
I love this!
When she get back with James ? He doesn’t want to be on camera anymore ?
So excited for you, Tati! Hope everything goes well. Love watching some of my favourite Youtuber's new journey. Also watch Taylor Wynn and her "nomad" journey. Feels like you guys bring me on your journey. Good luck guys! 🖤

As an old grandma, it always made my heart so happy to see a young couple so happy & full of love for each. Of course there are difficult times in every marriage but you two are going to be fine. Have faith in the Lord & your live & support of each other. God Bless 🙏🏼💜🙏🏼

Oh my gosh!! I was so hoping it was Texas!!!!! You're going to love it here, Tati!! Texas hospitality is well known for a reason!!! 😁 also, some must do things: Visit HEB! NASA! Houston Rodeo! Fredericksburg! Brenham/Blue Bell! River Walk! ACL and SXSW! Texas Renaissance Festival! Big Bend National Park! Buc-cee's!   And there's so much more!!
Welcome to Texas! ❤️
I am so excited for her new start and for her to be in Texas because I am such a fan. But did anyone else from Texas make this 😬 face when she said she like the weather here. I like it most of the time but it really can be so unpredictable. It can be a little nuts sometimes.
I like this format!!
Wait... I'm confused. Why cant you take everything with you makeupwise?
I'd love to see more about your move,  I'm so glad you left LA.. I can't imagine how you dealt with the toxicity there and the gloominess of Seattle so I'm very happy that you all are going to Texas.   I wish you every happiness and Blessing! XXOO ❤️
Girl I LOVE THE out shine pops! No should added!bummer they raised thr price
Horses, cowboy hats , Tex/mex food, wide open spaces, and no state tax! One of the “ free”states!
Congratulations!! Hope y'all love it!
I knew that she was going to TX!!  Best of luck!! Can't wait to see more of the journey😍
Congrats on the new start! I wish you and james and pooka nothing but love, laughter, and good fortune ♥️
Love moving and home videos!
How exciting always wanted to see Texas. So happy for you safe trip and take care hugs .
Yay! We welcome you to Texas! Hope the Lord continues to move in you and through you and bless you on this new adventure of life! 💜
So happy to see Tati happy!! So deserved !!
Yee haw! Welcome to Texas! Good luck with the move. A fun video would be some of the "cultural" differences you guys notice between the West Coast and Texas.
My guess was you were moving to Texas, congratulations!!!
Where was she staying before ?

woohoo welcome to texas!!! ♥️♥️
Tati, So happy for you and James. I live in Texas and know you will love it.
Do a hybrid!! Love your makeup videos but bring us in on a vlog now and then it adds that extra touch of closeness we already have with you. It’s like a rare sneak peek in treat we get. I value and appreciate when you do things for us and I love how much more transparent and honest you are. You’ve really found yourself again and it’s so contagious seeing you so happy and at peace
So excited for you both. Been watching since you started. Excited to welcome you to Texas!!!

Which song played at min 17 ?
So excited for you both! Home and decorating, plus your makeup vlogs, a move to Texas, all sound great.. I'm Australian and have been to the US many times but never to Texas. I've always had and an interest in Native American culture and the west, I love western art.. I know it's beautiful state, so look forward to you showing us around!  ❤🦘
Yes more vlogs!!
Seattle weather!!!   kinda like when you decide to get your hair cut then all of a sudden it looks great the day of the cut!!
Love this for you, I also just moved to Texas. Loving here so far. 💓 hope you enjoy it and it brings you happiness 😊
You are the best. Congratulations on your move. :)

Very happy for you and James. I lived in South Texas for 10+ years and it was a great place to be and raise my family. Cost of living, weather and Texas friendly people made it a wonderful experience. Good choice, you're going to thrive and love it! I am happy and thrilled for you!
Welcome to Texas!!! Also I miss seeing James in your videos!
YAY! I live in Texas. I am jealous because we are looking for property. Unfortunately, because so many people are moving here from other states, property values are climbing outrageosly.
Vlogs are the best, Love them
omggg congratulations!! so happy for you guys!!!!
How exciting! Congrats! Can't wait to see what's to come!... Also love all the footage of Puka, super cute! 💕
LoVe this kind of content from you 💕

Great vlog! Packing is so stressful but thankfully there’s always an end and deadline! We moved to TX 12 years ago and love it! Everyone is so nice and welcoming ! I hope they’re as wonderful to you and James!

I need all the vlogs!!! Give it all to us!! Please!  Hi James. We miss you!
Good luck with all that comes with moving!! Love love love the idea of you vlogging 😍😍 please do!!!
I packed a home we were in for 15 years, with SEVEN kids, and had to pack up all my husband's things and my mother's, who had both just died. We sold my mom's house right before so that was a mess of things just moved to my house, and leaving what was suppose to be our forever home without my husband, who died in that home wee he turned 45, with kids who didn't want to move nearly killed me. Don't worry about the work of moving because it gets done and if move is good and not a sad event, enjoy every moment getting to your new happiness.
Texas, it’s a pretty great state. The weather though…. Speaking from a born and breed Texan, it can be snowing on Monday and be  110 degrees on Tuesday.
Welcome to Texas, Tati and James!  Yeehaw!
You will do great in this next chapter! I heard the people in TX are very nice and welcoming, you'll have to tell us all about it! There is something very refreshing and exciting about moving to a place where you don't know anyone, I've done it a couple of times!
Tati good luck on ur new chapter ❤💗❤💗❤💗
I love how you shared your new beginning, I hope it is a magical adventure!
Wishing y'all all the best. Happy trails...
Yess this is the Tati content I’ve been waiting for!

Can’t wait to see the new place. Exciting times!!!  Make a part 2!
I’m from TX originally and I think you will love it there. Don’t know if you’ve made it there by now but if so hope you are settling in nicely. Wish you were coming to Tennessee where I am now!
Love the format!! Can’t wait to watch your adventure unfold!

Have fun in the land of the Free!!!!
Hi Tati- I've watched you for YEARS now and from this Texas girl- welcome home!!
Tati with your personality and your way to describe things so we'll have you thought of a vlog series that would focus on you learning our great state of Texas, you could call it "Tati tries" and it could be all sorts of things food, locations, events,FOOD LOL
Ahhhhh!!!! I’m screaming!! From a native Texan- welcome!! The cotton candy skies-the food! We are our OWN country!! Welcome Y’all! Ain’t nothing better than TX!!!💗💜
Texas is Wonderful!!! Welcome!!
I literally love the clog style video from you!!! Please do more like this!!!
Lol your “not very big” closet is insanely massive compared to mine 🤪
Welcome to Texas Tati and James!
Yess Tati!! Welcome to the greatest country in the world 🎉 If yall are ever near a Bucees definitely recommend stopping by❤️
Tati you MUST come to San Antonio for fiesta! As a more mature female I have followed you because you know the mature skin struggle even tho you are forever 27 in my eyes lol
love this!!!!!
Welcome to our beautiful Texas. Hope y'all love it
From a fellow Texan, Welcome to Texas!! You will find that you make friends so quickly because most Texans are very friendly! Would love to hear what general area of our great state you are landing in🥰
VLOG MORE LETS GOOO TATIIII
It’s so interesting to see a lot of YouTubers who have been around for nearly a decade + starting to settle down, move out of huge cities, start families, etc. I also think the pandemic put a lot of things in perspective that internet fame, clout, PR parties and what not are not as fulfilling as we once used to think and now we are craving more wholesome things.
Congratulations to your new start. God is with you so everything will be great!!! Just keep working on the baby so all of y'all can move in together.🤞
I’m so excited about the moving vlogs, thank you.
I live north of Seattle and I’m kinda sad I don’t even have the chance to run into you now lol. Is that silly or what
YESSSSS GIRLLLLLLL ✅ Please do other types of videos as well ✅ I do NJOY make-up videos, but that can get a lil boring  🙄 Do vlogs with shopping 🛒🛍️ buying make-up 💄💅 dinner dates 🍛 🍸  YAYYYYY I'M SO FAR IT 🌼
Tati I would love to have like mental health talks, daily vlogs, and just heart to heart discussions via vlog form:) also new restaurants or recipes you might try or places!
I know it’s not normally what you film but I love organizing videos if that’s something you’re interested in doing with the new place!
Loves the vlog style!
So happy for you Tati to officially be a Texan! Sending good vibes your way! Xo 😘 💋
Tati I love the Vlog style video please do more videos like this. Welcome to Texas!
You’ll love Texas, been here all 24 years of living. I’ll never live anywhere else!
We wish you the very BEST in Texas!
Welcome to Texas !❤ love you Tati !
I have lived in Austin my entire life. Texas folks are different LOL
Also @tati  if you need a TX friend I’m happy to help lol 🤣
Everyone's moving to Texas!  My Sister and her husband moved from San Francisco to Austin!
Welcome to Texas! Texas girl here too - so if you need any recommendations on great things in Texas - Lemme know!
Are you afraid of death?  Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
Anyone else live in TX and freaking knew she was moving here bc EVERYONE is moving here LOL welcome Tati!
Welcome Tati! We moved to Texas 14 years ago, and it has been so, so wonderful for us! We love living so close to Austin. I hope that you aren’t too far away!
Congrats beauty!!! xoxoxo
FINALLY A VLOG! YAY! I've been asking for this for forever! 🥰
Loved the vlog Tati!
I was 100% secretly hoping you'd be moving to Upstate NY - closer to Nurse Erica. (i follow her over on IG lol) Tons of land here and you get all 4 season nicely.
🤣 “hey sweetheart stick to the makeup”… no this was awsome! Good luck

I always enjoy watching your video. It is so much fun to go on the journey with you. 😊👍
Welcome to Texas!! Bucee’s is a must stop for sure !! It’s a huge gas station with so much goodies! @tati
Welcome, ya’ll!!   I am so happy for you guys!!! ☺️  I moved to Central Texas last July after living in Rhode Island my whole life.  You are going to love it here!!!  PS. Be prepared to be called ma’am all the time! 😉
I sure hope where you’re at now, that you weren’t affected by the crazy weather and tornadoes!
Good luck Tati!!! 💜💜
Yay!!! I just bought my first home… find your moving buddy’s 💜
Oh yes more vlogs!
I’m so excited for you!!! I’m a veteran military wife and moved many times over the years. Let me tell you, it’s always hard to move. However, I have many friends that live in Texas and are from Texas. They are wonderful people and I think you will love this new chapter in your life.:) cheers!!!
Omg!!! You're going to have to meet Xo,MaCenna!! She's been renovating her cottage and I bet she can hook you up with info!
Hey Tati! It is so funny, my husband and I moved from the Houston area up to Seattle about 3 years ago and now you’ve moved to Texas! Compared to Seattle, it probably feels like your living in a mansion.
Welcome to Texas Tati!
I felt that “stretching out” part big time when I moved from West Hollywood CA to Boulder County CO. Love it here. Miss the beach, but it’s only a plane flight away!
I personally still love makeup videos !!! But this video was also awesome ☺️
Been watching you for years and it was so fun to watch a vlog with my friend. Texas is wonderful, my hubby is from there and it’s wonderful to visit! ❤️  Whatever privacy you need we respect ❤️
I knew it was going to be Texas!!!! Excited to watch your adventure! We live in Canada and we’re considering moving to Texas, so it will be great to watch this happening for you. 🤍🤍🤍
love this type of video - keep doing them please!
Hey neighbor! I am in Oklahoma, so you're not super far from me. I hope the move went very smoothly, and that you can get settled into your new home very soon!
OOOOMMMGGG WELCOME TO TEXAS!!! I AM SO EXCITED!! You’re going to LOVE IT!!!!!

What lipstick did you use?! It was the only thing not listed😂🤔
Absolutely loved this video ☺xx
Absolutely loving the vlog style.
I knew you were moving to Texas! It’s so family friendly
Welcome to Texas Tati!
Hard to pack.  We are in 4 seasons right now! Lol
Tati!! Welcome to Texas!!! I am a Texas native and you will love it here! Let me know when you want a meet up!! I would live to hear you play the piano and go along your adventures!
I love how you say your closet was small… I’ve lived in bedrooms the size of your closet (or smaller) that have NO closet, lol. Im happy that you are moving to a place with more space! My fiancée and I are about to buy our first home! We are the only people who put an offer on the house and it’s in the final stages! We are going to close in the next 3 weeks or so! I’m so excited!
More vlogs please Tati!! I'm so happy for you and this new beginning ❤️
Welcom to Texas. Yay!! I'm soooo excited for you guys..  You are going to LOVE in Tx.

Not sure how religious you are but trying out new churches when I moved was an awesome way to make really good friends
I loved this makeup montage edit!!
Allergies girl get ready especially during cedar season 😩
Big moves are trending, first you moved to Seattle, now Texas. Shane and Ryland moved to Colorado. Jeffrey Starr moved to Montana. Everyone is happier with their changes. A refresh for mind, body, and soul. All the best to you and James.

So excited to see your vlogs!! Love this video all vlogs feel like girl time and it really helps me get through the week. Congratulations and wish you the best in your journey 🖤
You're going to love Texas! I'm in Louisiana and LOVE the weather. It gets pretty hot in the summertime but that's what ac is for! The nature and slower pace is going to be so good for you. Not to mention people are just nicer in the south. Good luck on your move and just know it'll all be worth it.
I love this format honestly - it’s fun and more like we are just chatting! You can still do this AND makeup, mix and match🙂
I love spending time w you through a vlog😍😍
Women that hide their looks with make up are liars and cannot be trusted.
I knew it was going to be Texas! Haha. I watched your other vlog and it gave all the Texas vibes. We welcome y’all with open arms!
i know your money by ng to Texas, I moved to Texas in 2008 never looked back, it’s an amazing state. Congratulations I’m happy for you guys, thank you for your time
Does James not want to be on camera anymore? We love him as well as you, hopefully he knows that! ❤
I live in Texas you'll love it. Way cheaper to live here than Washington
Onward and upward tati! All the motivation to you!!! Hope you have an amazing start :)
Mazel tov on the move and loving the Vlogs!!
Are you guys safe? I know there was a lot of tornadoes out that way two days ago.
Welcome to Texas!
OMG!  You would be amazing with horses. Take lessons, you won't regret it.
Woohoo! Texas crew!
Can’t say it enough!!! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this format!!!!! PLEASE keep em coming!!!!!!
Welcome to Texas!!!!
I love this side of you Tati...so exciting! Congratulations on the move!!
🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲👏👏👍👍👍💪💪🙏🙏💯💯🤣🤣😅🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
I moved to Texas four years ago, love it!
I loved this video & would also love a part 2! 🤍
Absolutely loving the Tati life journey! Luv to know “why Texas?’ What experience lead u to this choice? This is amazing and fascinating and fun 💕🌟🌸
There’s gonna be a spider issue in TX! 😁 I’m looking forward to the vlogs!
You’re going to love it here ♥️. When you have the time. Fredericksburg is a must see town in the hill country!
OMG, I’m so excited you’re moving to Texas!!! I watched your past videos and kept thinking Texas would be the perfect place for you & that’s where you would move. So excited!!
I love you sharing more of your life, I feel like we’re besties. Keep doing what makes YOU happy, that’s what we love to see!!
So happy for you 🥰
I moved to Texas on my own in 2007... fast forward to 2022 and I have never been more grateful for a life change! Texas is beautiful! But please, vlog the first time y'all visit a Buc-ee's! 🥰
You should definitely vlog more!😍
SO many people are moving to Texas right now, it’s nuts.
It's a actually kind of uncomfortable to hear you constantly say that is not a big home. It actually is, your closet IS big. Of course there are bigger homes, but I think you are comparing yourself to other YouTubers and that's not fair to you
Can I just say that I am loving your vlog style video ❤❤
Hello
Love this format!❤
Yesss to more vlogs!!! So happy and excited for you. Wish you all the best and looking forward for what's to come!!!
Yes to more vlogs!
I hope the move went well.  Enjoy your new home!  🌺
Hi Tati, I am so excited for you! I know how you feel as I've been in the UK for over 4 years and the weather is terrible. I'm moving to Spain soon and I can't wait for the sunshine and sea to be my home again. I would LOVE to see more lifestyle vlogging - your new home, decor and decorating, horses, gardening, cooking and just general homebody stuff. I hope this move lifts your spirits and you can start to feel happy and energetic and creative again. I hope you'll take us along for the ride! xo's
Funny that she shows her closet that is the size of my bathroom and says that it's not very big. Perspective is everything in life.
Welcome to the sunny south with us! Keep vlogging! Keep on keeping on! Love makeup but watch to see you, not just makeup! So having this format too is great. I am excited for you and your new adventure!
insipid, self indulgent and narcissism .... less of it please, no idea why this junk is trending what is happening in this world, its just some one with too much makeup moving house !!
We will keep you company!
Texas, come on down! Don't know where you're going to be but hope you're happy here. I've been! Been here my whole life!😍🥰😆
Totally love this format I also loved how you did the make format in this video - wishing you so much happiness in Texas and away from the negativity of LA.
Welcome to Texas! 😘
I'm in kitsap County so close then so far away. Good luck on your move!
Congratulations and happy trails!!! Yes, yes, yes more vlogs like this👍👍👍 So exciting and so very happy for you! Sending happy vibes💕💕💕
I love these videos
I'm born and raised in Northern California and I want to move to Texas soooooo bad I have so many friends who live in the Dallas/Ft Worth area and it's just so great! So happy for you. My friends who moved there say everyone is so nice they have block parties they got invited to a block party their first time a grocery story just being in line chatting with someone. It's just so different. I loved this vlog. You really do seem so happy. :)
We are so happy to have you in Texas!!! More vlogs please!!!! Wooohoooo!!! 🤍🤍
I’m so glad you and James worked your things out! You’re my favorite YouTube couple! If you can’t make it no one can so I love seeing you both together and happy! Excited to watch your new adventure! I lived in Louisiana for a year and it was amazing!
😍
Love the vlog format!
When I saw the title and the cowboy boots I knew where you were moving... Welcome to Texas y'all!  I am 65 mi east of Dallas. If I've mentioned it once I've mentioned it 100 times, I'm so glad you're back!
I’m so happy to see you happy congrats on your new adventure and good luck
I hope you love Texas! I lived in Houston for a while, and HEB is still the best grocery chain ever.
Godspeed Tati! So very happy for you! On a random note…I just saw a commercial for Big O Tires that plays the closing music from your YouTube videos!! Made me think of you.
Not Texas Tati... always knew u were a republican
I’m so happy for you. It’s good to see you excited. My vote is for more vlogs so keep em’ coming.

Vlogs are a great progression for your channel too since beauty is having a bit of an identity crisis.  You're the only channel  left that is good.  I'd love to see a clothing haul or style try-ons.  You're fantastic!
And yes! You always have us for company. Count on us to show up for you
I’m sorry this might be crazy but I started watching you on YT where I grew up in OC Cali. You were in LA. I moved to Tacoma WA cus the army and you were in Seattle. And then we did another move to El Paso TX cus the army and now you’re moving to TX! Funny how god moves people sometimes, best of luck moving I love Texas I’m sure you will!
Hell yeah welcome to the Great State!! You’ll love it!
I am so excited for this new content!!!  So happy for you and James!!!  Congratulations!!  Good luck!!!
Yeah please this type of style is so dope and fun to watch fr you loves it really every bit!
I love when you vlog! I feel like we've seen bits and pieces of vlogs when you've gone shopping over the years. You've become an important part of our lives.  When I get compliments on my makeup, they're compliments to you, you've taught me so much. You are the first beauty guru I watched. It makes me so happy that you and James are beginning a new adventure together!  BTW please tell James that we miss seeing him. I support his decision (like I have a say😂) but still miss seeing him in your videos. Your unboxing videos were so fun! Safe travels and sending you love and best wishes for all the good things you deserve! 🙏🏻😊🤗🥰
Only Tati would turn on the glam meter on a moving day! Sending you so much good energy on your exciting new chapter ❤️
elizabeth torres 1 second ago Omg!! Yesssss! Texas Tati! Born and raised Texan 🤚🏽! So excited for you to get to know how awesome we Texans are! ❤️❤️ When you said Texas I out yelled omg no way!

I always say to anyone that moves to TEXAS to keep it STRONG, keep it KIND and TRUE to its roots!! So thrilled to hear your moving to TEXAS you're going to love it !!  So excited for you❤ I think it would be so cool for you to get into some horse related disciplines such reining, western pleasure , hunter jumped or  dressage! They'll also make for pretty cool vlogs🐴😍 You'd be great at it!!
Welcome to Texas. It’s an amazing state. Love you.
Loved it! You crack me up! You are the best! Can’t wait to join you, and thanks for sharing the makeup time too. I wish you all the best.

Good luck with the move.  Oh it is sooo much work but you'll be there before you know it!
OMG!! Tati is coming to my STATE😍😍😍
Love you Tati!
Texas is beautiful, affordable and not so stuffy and close minded as people may think. I get where your head is at. Good luck to you and James and of course your fur baby!
You got this!
Does anyone know why she doesn’t show James anymore? Did I miss something? 🙁
You can do whatever you please and I assure you that I will see it!!😝
Yay!! Texas!!! I would love to get a chance to meet you 😭😭
So many people are moving to Texas nowadays ! This really makes me want to visit and see for myself !
Looking forward to more vlogs!! ❤️

Love these types of videos! Loving lifestyle content way more than beauty videos recently! Congrats on your move and excited to follow along!
I 😁❤️❤️❤️ that your vlogging!
So excited for you tati!! Yay Texas! We live in CT. It's been the longest winter ever and it's so expensive here. We'd love to go down south, but we couldn't leave family. Part 2 please! But also, please don't stop makeup. But more puka (spelling?) Doggy updates❤
I love the color of your hair, a little lighter than your normal !!!!!!! Beautiful 🤩
So happy for you!  You’ll get nicer people, better food, and more bang for your buck in the good ole Lone Star State!  Congrats!
I definitely love you vlogging! I’m looking forward to part 2 and 3 and 4 ….have a good move! you look tired but happy and I’m here for it 😍

Congrats Tati!! So happy for y’all!! 🤍🤍
Love the blog! Would love to see more and so excited to see your journey.
Yea Texas!!! We have a great State!! ❤️❤️
Love this content. Keep it coming.
Loved it!!!
I loved  this video! I would like to see  more like it. Good luck and congratulations!
I literally screamed when you said Texas - I’m a DFW native and love it here!!
Love love love the vlog format
Wild horse's! But get yourself some firearms.. illegal alien criminal activity is high. Not to mention the bombing and shootings on the Mexico side of the boarder and on our side, with the cartel leader being arrested. Be safe! Don't vote Democrat! Please 🙏🏻
Welcome to Texas!!! There are things to love and hate about this state (just like any other state) but the skies really do seem bigger and bluer here. So happy to see you make a fresh start and I do think you’ll love it here. 😊
Goot to see you Best vlog love ❤️ it . Iam From Nepal 🇳🇵 😍  .
More vlogs please! And as a native and current Houstonian (and longtime fan) welcome to Texas…congrats on the move!! ❤️
So I also lost my wedding ring once! I was devastated! I tore things apart, searched high and low, couldn’t find it anywhere. I gave up hope.. my wonderful husband (luckily for me is a jeweler, but still it was so sad!) made me a new ring. We moved, as we were unpacking my mother in law was going through makeup bags, and there she was in all her glory, my original ring! So keep your faith, and look it all the cracks and crevices of your bags!
I really loved this!! 💗💕
With 49 states to choose from I could never move to Texas because they are anti- women and anti progressive.  I have lived in communities that are Republican dominated and they are surface level nice, and that’s it.   Too uncomfortable to be around so many people who are so sure that their beliefs are the ones that everyone needs to follow.  But hey, if that’sOK for you, we all hope you’ll be happy.
I would love to see vlogs from you. I was born and raised in KS., joined the navy and met my husband, got out and moved to TX. where he is from. I have lived here for over 30 years now and it is a great place to live. I hope you love it here.
She took blogging and made it cool wow
Help fix Texas!
Love this side of Tati world!
I just moved to Texas this year as well! Love it here & hope you do too! ❤️
Sending love and prayers Tati! 🙏🏻💜
I’m so happy for you! ❤️ and you can do this! 🙌👌👍
Yesss a love this type of videos tatiii ♡♡♡ congrats God Bless and good bibes
Good for you!!! Hahaha as long as you vote Republican 😆😆welcome girl you deserve all the best, sending good vibes and prayers for happier times. Great new video 💙
As a long time New York City resident the amount of space you have in your Seattle local is vast!! That said, I'm excited you guys to embark on your new adventure and to be moving somewhere that will hopefully fit your desires more. Looking forward to more vlogs!
Welcome to Texas!
Ahh congratulations!! As a Texas girl myself I think you and James will love it! There’s so much to do and see and explore. Sending you positive vibes in your new home!
Texas is awesome!!!! Is ur stepson going?
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
I would love to see a video of the make up you choose to take  while you wait for the rest of your make it to arrive to you! Love your videos 💕
Yesss more vlogs!!!!!!!!❤😍
🎉Loving this for you and just an idea: Why don't you start a Tati x James Vlog Channel? (keep your Glam Life Guru Channel about your makeup)😉
I love this type of video Tati!
Girl I’m in Texas! If you get bored just hit me up
I am so excited for you. My fiancé and I are also moving to Texas within the month. I’ve watched our so long and for the first time you and I are going to be in the same state. Congratulations ❤️❤️❤️
You’ll love TX. I lived there 8 years and literally today I arrived in Massachusetts for our next chapter
Seriously.  Leave the make up videos behind, it’s so 2015.  That ship has come and left.    More videos like this!   This is awesome!!!!
Don’t stick to the makeup! These are my favourite!!
Omg her eating the outshine popsicle..yesss
Yay!  I live in TX. You’ll love it. If you need a good church I can recommend a lot.
Omg the dog barking yeehaw at 13 min
I knew it! Welcome to Texas…the best state in the country!!! I can’t wait to find out what city!
This make up look at 8min is INCREDIBLE!
Would love home/ lifestyle content!
Omggg I am loving the tunes at 6 mins! I love the music during the speed make up application
yay TEXAS!! more vlogs please!
Congratulations!! Texas is wonderful. My family is originally from LA, but we moved to the Dallas/Fort Worth area with my dad's job in 1998. Grad school and work brought me to Chicago, but thankfully my parents are still in Texas so I get to visit! I am a life-long equestrian. If you happen to be relocating to North Texas, look up Renee Albrecq. She is an incredible trainer and has such a gift for teaching and matching riders with horses. Enjoy this new chapter! I hope it is everything y'all need.
Welcome to Texas Tati!!!!! Love you! Maybe I'll run into you some day!!🥰😘♥️ #McAllen, Tx.
LOVEEEEE THE VLOGING!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
OMG pls do more vlogs. Soo much more fun to watch x Best of luck with the new chapter

I’m so happy for you and James! I pray you didn’t encounter any of the bad storms and tornadoes in TX earlier this week. I love vlog style videos! I would love to see more videos like this.
I knew it!!   I guessed Texas on your last post.  I’m a native Texan and even though I’ve moved around a lot, and I’ve been back for the last couple of decades.  I hope you guys enjoy it!!
So excited for your new chapter! Love the vlog style!
Yes absolutely 100% more blogs like this , love!  It shows you as a person as a couple makes you feel more accessible and real not just somebody we're watching putting makeup on. Love the makeup but this in addition is sublime.  Good luck with your move 🥂

Thumbs up to anything you post! we love you Tati! 😍

It was like the best moment to hear James bring you coffee! Why is he not showing his awesome Cow boy look! Congrat lady! Your going to be awesome. I’m terrified your going to get an accent 😂😂😂
LOVE this format.  Only from you.  And cheers to 4th Popsicle lovers everywhere.
Welcome to Texas! We are happy to have ya!
I had a feeling that’s where you were going to move! I think this is going to be a great new chapter. To new beginnings 🥂
So excited for your new chapter I wish you picked Tennessee it’s beautiful and way better than Texas!! Be ware of all the suburban housewives in Texas they may be more cut throat than la girls lmao best wishes!!
I missed seeing James and poukashell!!
I absolutely love this vlog please more!! Sending you lots of good vibes through this process. Love u Tati!!
I knewwww it!!! Everyone is moving here to Texas ! I don’t like it but Tati your the exception! We want you here !!
I loved this video and I’m so happy for you! 💖 this is so inspiring for me to follow my moving dreams. Would love more videos like this 💜💜💜💜
Tati, I moved up to Seattle around the same time you did, and now I am also moving again. Seattle is beautiful but also full of crazies. Thank you for your vlog as it’s inspiring me to keep packing!
I have missed you so so so much that I would literally watch you doing nothing at this point haha Vlogs are my favorite though so I’m here for it!
Love it when you drink coffee.  Texas is a fab choice.  It will suit you.  Blessings and belief in you.
CANT WAIT FOR PART 2. 😍😍😍😍😍 Best wishes to both of you. ❤️
You. Will be neighbors. Yay. Welcome home
Congratulations to you both and I loved the vlog! I wish you SO MUCH HAPPINESS!!!❤💐✌
I NEED to know the coffee order!
So excited for you!! ❤️ We just moved to TX from Portland almost a year ago! Like you, I’d never moved out of state without literally knowing a single soul here!  We’ve found an awesome church and community that is so welcoming and I wish we’d moved sooner. It’s a big adjustment but hang in there!   FYI- May is wet and rainy but the gray days are nothing like the Pacific NW.
Yesss!!!!!!! Absolutely more vlogs like this!!! Absolutely LOVED! the renovation process!!! Ahhhhhhhh yes! Cannot wait
I had a feeling when I watched your other video that y’all would be moving to texas. Welcome!
Love all ur content! Showing love from one Washingtonian to Another! Good luck on ur New Move, Adventure, and Continued Success! Huggs🌞🌷🌻🙏🙋‍♀️♡
yaaa welcome to TX we do have bipolar weather but most of the time its hot and sunny =)
Love this vlog so new🤗❤️
Looks like Mother Nature decided to give you a welcome party last night! Hope y’all made it through the bad weather OK!!
Ok I don't care. Tell youtube and its algorithm I said kcuF you
Love this!!!  Welcome to Texas Tati!!  Please do more of these!!!
Sigh, so many northerners moving to Texas. Why not...anywhere else
So happy for you ❤️❤️
Yes! Keep us involved! Love this!
Welcome! Hope you choose Dallas or Houston. Best food and neighborhoods
puka seems beeerryy angory about the fact that he's going to have a yard lmao
Yaaasss more vlog content!! 💖💖
Welcome to Texas.  It's a great place to live.
I miss unboxing’s with James!
Here for the genuine real content, where influencers are comfortable with being imperfect but hilarious.
We accumulate so much as we get older and it makes moving horrible. Moving in my 20s was so much easier than moving in my 40s. The good part is moving to a new place is really exciting and will be over soon enough. I'm sure things will work out great and you and James will be happy in your new place. Sending positive energy.
Omg Tati yay! Welcome to Texas!! I’ve lived here my whole life but I have moved around Texas, there are so many beautiful places here to see 💖🌸
Loved the personal vlog, thanks for sharing!! Good luck with your move it’s always exciting and overwhelming at the same time! I was wondering if you’ve ever done a video on how you remove your makeup and what’s good or your skincare routine. Would love to see that, thank you!
Tat, you video has such an original title. Love it. Lol. Totally kidding with you by the way!
I live here in Texas. I have my whole life. I really can’t believe how many people have moved here the last 2 years and how many people are STILL moving here. It’s crazy! Most locals hate it because transplants come and try to do here what they were escaping from in other states. I, however, welcome it. Our economy is booming and it’s amazing. Especially when it’s sweet people like you and James. Y’all will fit right in. Welcome!!!
Ihaaaaa! Have a great move! Love from Rio
Welcome to Texas!
I'm here for the journey!
That closet is huge. I love it. The shoes 😍
PLSSS DO MORE VLOGS
I hear Texas is the place to be!  Maybe I’ll buy my tiny house and move to Austin!  I’ll have no friends!  Will you be my friend if you’re moving near Austin?
how bout you move to the trenches instead 🥰
Omg, I had a feeling you were coming to Texas 🤠. So excited for you.
welcome to texas tati!! ❤️ can’t wait to see your next video
Everybody’s moving to Texas!  Maybe I should buy a tiny home and move to Texas!  I hear Austin is the place to be!
I'm a Texas gal! Can't wait to have you here! Would love to help if you ever need anything. 💛
I love Texas, lived in Katy.  Just watch out for the fire ants
During the pandemic I stopped watching a lot of the Beauty Channels I used to love due to wearing masks that covered up makeup, so I felt no need to spend that money on makeup or to know what was good and not good.  I still like to watch VLogs of random everyday life, so I would definitely prefer to see more content like this, it's more relatable, especially post pandemic!
Loving this new format and being part of your new adventure! :)
I knew it!!!  When I saw you were going to move I figured it would be Texas.  Welcome!
luv you
Loved this!  Can’t wait to see your journey guys. Lots of love xx
I am so excited to see your journey. This is amazing. Everyone falls sometimes and it's all about how we get back up and that we get back up. You have done that and that is so amazing! Can't wait to see ur new place. I love your make up videos so please don't take those away lol I like these kind of videos from u as well.....There can be both right? What do you think about starting a vlog channel? 🤔 either way, I'm there lol
OMG. TEXAS! That's where I live. How exciting. Good luck 😃
💋
I love this vlog style video!
I love the vlogging! Can’t wait to see more
YES MAAM WELCOME TO TEXAS!!! 👏🏻🎉
I guessed it would be Florida or  Texas!! Congrats on your move!
I’m loving the new angle with the vlog. Much love Tati ❤️‍🔥🥰🥰🥰
Loved the vlog, please keep doing them. It was like visiting you.
Really enjoyed this video! Waiting for some more of the Tati WORLD!
I definitely want to see Texas vlogs! We keep saying if we were ever to leave Washington, we’d move to Texas
My husband is from Houston TX but we’re stuck in a small appartment in Vegas due to his work :( I’m so excited you get to go there and seeing the state my husband is from! And I can’t wait to go there too!!!
So happy for you Tati ❤️ love the format plus loved u sharing your spirituality want more! Been with u from the beginning

Yes to more vlogs like this! Best wishes, XO!
Yassssss love the vlogs!!!!!
I lived in Dallas for a short time when I was a kid and my dad has lived there just about my entire life. It’s definitely a cool place in a lot of areas. Angelica Nyqvist recently moved to Austin! If you’re going to be in that area, you should meet up! I can see you guys getting along for sure
Congratulations and best of luck!!! 🏡 Thanks for sharing your life with all of us 🤗

Tati I am so happy for you!! I wish nothing but the best in this new chapter of your life! Many good vibes to you!
You got this Tati!
More blogs please!!
TATI IM SO EXCITED YOU’RE COMING TO TEXAS!!! I hope I get to meet you one day :) You’ve been my fav YouTuber since 2016!!!
Vlogs please!! Love them!
Another family fleeing the blue states!
Yaaayyy! Come to Texas!
I had this gut feeling that you were moving to Texas. Don't know why but I felt like I already knew it before you said it!!! Congratulations on your move. I live here in Texas just moved last year and love it here.
This was a good!! Love how you did it
Love this for you❤
Awww a little bit of James!!!  I love this!  And while I’m sad no Tati near Pennsylvania I am so happy for your heart soul and spirit to embrace this new chapter in your lives. I love you to death!
Love life vlogs
I love your make up videos and always have, but I love your vlog content just as much, if not, even more. I 100% think you should do whatever you’re comfortable sharing. I’m excited for y’all new journey and hope this move is exactly what y’all are hoping for🤍
I loved this fun side of you! 💕💕💕
Yes please more vlogs on your move
We’re moving to  . . . . .??
So exciting! Congratulations on the move!!!
I love this ❤️❤️❤️ more vlogs . You seem so haooy
Find a church!! That is the best way to build a new community fast in a new place. I love the idea of Tati vlogs and it was nice to hear James. I’m always praying for you guys am so excited to see this new chapter unfold for you 💜💜💜
The moving part can be overwhelming, but it is totally worth it.  I was a third generation Californian and moved to Idaho several years ago.  We knew no one, but I have always told my husband that my home is wherever he is 💖  We knew no one, but we has each other and that was all that mattered to me.  God bless you and James on your new adventure!
I called that on Twitter!! Knew you’d go to Texas!!
So excited for you!  Good luck and many blessings.
You’re gonna love Texas
I had a feeling it was Texas 🙂
Congrats! Best wishes on this new journey in your life. Blessings always to you, James and your family 😇
We wannnt more vlogs!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 Enjoy every second of you movement, cuse one day it will be a sweet memory 😊
I loved this video. Absolutely do more!! 👍🏻🥰
This is where it’s at 👏🏼 yasss love this and sooOoO happy for you
Content is great. I hope you enjoy Texas, I would be miserable with all the Republicans. Id probably kill them or myself lol.
Moving is stressful…. Music and my creature comforts so help!! Purging of stuff is so cathartic and then it’s a fresh start. Best of luck!
Love the vlogs hate the idea of showing personal things like our homes because I'm super paranoid as well.
Lol why did "videos with Bunny" pop in my head.
More vlogs???? YEEEEEESSSS PLEEEEEEASE
Oh wow good luck with the move! How exciting. Yes I love this kind of vlog from you - more like this please!
🥰
Non attention seeking people keep it to themselves.
Its gonna be great!!!!
Welcome to the great state of Texas, Tati!!!😍🤩   Be sure to check out our beautiful Hill Country. A fave place of mine that you may like is Fredericksburg!💕
This has been the first video of hers in a while I enjoyed watching.  She's just super normal and genuine in this and not doesn't seem animated or pretentious like the makeup videos to me since coming back
So exciting! Where in Texas are you moving?
I missed youuuu
I’m so here for vlogging Tati!!!  Also whoooo can’t wait to see the Texas home. I’ve been in Texas for ten years and can’t bring myself to leaving
I think Texas will be a good fit for you guys.  We are a friendly bunch.  And you moved here just in time for the Tornados!
I love the vlogs Tati. And you got this. I moved to a different country all by myself, 8,5 years ago. I didn't know anyone and it has been the best decision of my life. I'm looking forward to more vlogs about Texas. ❤️
you are so beautiful
I love the vlogs so much Tati! I came for the makeup, but I stayed for you! I would love more videos like this. 💜💜💜

My favorite videos of yours are the full-day wear tests where you try out a new item and see how it wears and then you vlog throughout the day. These videos are the best of both worlds because we get to see a fair test of a new product plus we get to hang out with you all day! 💕

I moved from San Diego to Texas, almost 10 years ago. I’ll be honest… it was such a hard transition but throughout the pandemic, I was so glad I was here as opposed to California. The only thing I still haven’t adjusted to, is the weather. The summer heat is BRUTAL but other than that, I have never regretted my move to Texas, one bit! I wish you all the best on your move and new chapter, with James and the pup! Blessings! ✨💕
Wonder of we will be neighbor's. I live in the Hill Country, Texas.. near Austin and Fredericksburg..  welcome
Wishing you all of the best vibes Tati!!! ✨️
Good luck ❤️ 🧿
Safe journey to Texas Tati and James and Puka.  Big packing job,  Blessings.........    I truly loved this vlog and so hope you do more of them 💙💚💛

More vlogs, more lifestyle videos.. makeup is kinda played out. A lot of us don’t watch makeup tutorials that much anymore since the pandemic began.. so happy for you!
WHAT!? NO!!💔 I was born in Texas, lived there for a bit and I hated it with all my being.. I've lived in Washington State like, basically my life and would never move away from here! Sad I never got to run into you in Seattle!😕 Vlog about anything you love!
How did you move all of your furniture etc?? Moving cross country with my BF and we’re trying to figure it out!
Welcome to Texas!  Which part of Texas?
I really enjoyed this and I'm looking forward to seeing the renovations you do. I'm looking at buying my first home in the next 12 months fingers crossed and I want to really make my mark so I'm looking forward to seeing some functional storage tips and some nice style and not just boring beige. Also I now covet your coffee table.
OMMG TATI! How exciting!! I’m in Texas too (Originally from San Diego CA), love it here, never going back to CALI!
Your puppy saying YeeHaw 😂😂😂😂😂😂 so happy you're coming to TX. It's the best ever ♡ also be prepared for people to expect you to go like 20 over the speed limit in the far left lane. 😅😅 That's it that's all you need to know 🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱
I LOVE HOOKA. He is so adorable. Best puppy mommy ever.
Welcome to Texas!! My husband and I Made the move out from California not knowing anyone out here as well. As much as we love and miss our friends and Family, the move made our relationship so much stronger and we’ve created so many happy memories along the way. I love this vlog content along with your make up content. Love Anything you do honestly. Looking forward to seeing your journey unfold. 💜
I LOVE this style of video hopefully you do it more because it’s sooo fun to watch❤️❤️
I can’t wait for your Texas Vlogs!
Which part of Texas?
You can do it tati 💪 I’m so happy for you 🥰
I loved this video!!! i'm so up for Vlogs!! they're my favorite kind of video

To dramaville
so chuffed for you Tati! You’re my hope that life can get better no matter how deep in the gunk you are. All the best to you, James and Pukka in this new chapter. 💗 As far as content goes, I’ll watch whatever you feel like posting. I’ve never been disappointed by a Tati video.
IM SO HERE FOR THIS.
I squealed!! Welcome to Texas from a Houstonian 😍😍
You are so blessed to have James! He must be a gem.
Yes girl!!! Texas is the best!!! You will love it here! If you need a texas friend 🙋🏼‍♀️
This was in my feed, don't know why. Wanted to chime in and say, who cares where you moved? These picture perfect family vlogs are dumb. Lets act like we have zero problems. 😂
My guess was either Texas or North Carolina
Texas is the best!  Welcome.  I love it here and will always be here!!!  Love the vlog.  Many blessings on the move and starting a new chapter!!!
Love this! It’s fun to see lifestyle content& Texas will be great for you!
Stay safe Tati! You are moving to a war zone! Our southern border invasion is out of control. Machine guns being used in Houston. Crime up over 500% in areas that had low to no crime. Drug wars and cartels fighting it out in the streets. Fentanyl and drugs poring into our county.
I love vlogs Tati, please do more in the future!! Good luck with moving, it’s very healthy to start fresh from time to time 😘😘
Red state????????
YES TEXAS I’m here! I’ll be your friend!
Good choice Tati. I love Texas and New Mexico. So much better, down to earth people, so let go and let God.

We moved somewhere where we didn’t know anybody 2 years ago. It took some adjustment when birthdays and holidays came about, when we weren’t able to travel home. But it was the best thing we have ever done in the 22 yrs we’ve been together. Best of luck to you, James and Puca. Remember, you always have us here on YouTube.

Don’t stick to just makeup. It’s you’re channel have fun! So I moved around a lot as a kid and I’m introverted so I don’t have friends like most normal people would. I love makeup as well so listening to your videos, laughing when you do something funny gives me that feeling of having a friend for a short while. So I would to watch your vlogs. Share what you feel comfortable with, don’t feel pressured to put it all out there either. Anyways just want to say thank you, for being an Internet friend that I needed 😊
Looking forward to more vlogs like this! Wishing you all safe travels on your big move to Texas! ❤️
I'm so excited for you Tati. I can't wait to see the new blogs. Welcome to Texas

Yes Tati!!! I'm so happy for you and James to be moving to an area where you can have land and be able to do more. Definitely do more vlogging, home before and after project videos (we're remodeling our home too and would love inspo!), and even some style outfit videos. I'm ALL for your videos from makeup and more. Where I live at is the Florida panhandle (Destin area) so we see A LOT of Texans come this way for our beautiful water and vacation resorts. So happy you're making the big move!
Loving vlogging Tati😍
Love this video!!! Nice to see a glimpse of your new chapter and saying good-bye to the past! Love the vlog style!
I just relocated my family and small business from Maryland to Frisco,Texas in October. I never lived anywhere else but I was ready for a change. Texas is so amazing with so much to do and everyone has been so nice here. I still need to make some friends but i have no regrets. Life is too short to stay in one place. Welcome to Texas Tati 💗
I am so excited!!! I live in Texas! I hope you enjoy the wide open space ❤️
So excited for you! My bf and I are just a few short weeks away from moving from Vegas to Florida! We are so excited!
I loved this video please do more also I would love decor tips too I just moved so we're on the same journey ❤
I like the vlog! I LOVE the makeup so pretty please don't turn into just vlogging and lifestyle but I enjoy your content in both formats <3 So glad Texas won Tati! I can only hope to spot you in the wild at a local Target but it's a huge state so that probably won't happen. I can dream though! Enjoy Texas!
My sis moved from LA to Dallas about 9 years ago not knowing anybody and she’s loves it there and made some really great friends. I’ve been visiting a couple times a year. Just got back from Dallas and Austin. I think I love Austin more. My sis and now brother-in-law is trying to get be to move from LA.
Welcome to Texas!!! You've got lots of friends here :)
I watched this video while I was on the stairmaster at the gym and I was smiling because I was so happy for you! One of my gym friends actually came up to me and said “You need to rack up the intensity If you’re smiling like that!” But I was just so happy for you, watching this video made me so happy! More of these please!
I am so happy you are moving to Texas .. Love you ❤️
Yay! Closer to me in Oklahoma and we go to Texas often enough!
More vlogs please 🙌🏼.
Best wishes Tati! Can't wait to see your lovely new home in Texas!
Aww Tati! I’m so happy for you… I know you will love Texas! I am a Mississippi girl and believe everyone in their life needs to live in the south at some point. It’s different here, it’s not so fast pace, and the people are so welcoming and warm.   Can’t wait to see more vlogs from you! Wishing you all the best on your new journey! 💜
I’m Happy for you Tati and also, I Love Vlogs, like this one. Changes are Wonderful! We all have to be Thankful for New Beginnings. Bella! 💫
I just moved too Tati. Not for the faint of heart. But......boy am I glad I did. The grass can be greener
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus <3
Texas is amazing! More vlogs please! ❤️❤️❤️
Texas is amazing! More vlogs please! ❤️❤️❤️
Welcome to Texas!!! 🤠 So we moved here 8 years ago from FL with a one-year-old, no jobs and not knowing a single person…I legit cried when we landed…but TX has been the best decision we ever made!!! Also the best place to raise a family!!!
TEXAS!!!! Omg yesssss!!!! Hope I see you!!!😍
You’re moving to my home state!! When I watched your last video I had a weird feeling that it would be Texas. A lot of people from the west are moving here right now. But that’s so exciting!! You’re going to love it! Let us Texans know if you need any advice or recommendations!   Also, HEB grocery stores/Central Markets are great. If you get a chance to go to a Buccees DO it. There is no fair like the Texas State Fair. It’s huge. Oprah did a special on it. The sky is big in Texas. You’re going to get so much sun. I’m so happy for your new journey!
Yay!!!!!!!!!! Welcome to Texas!!! We love it here! The people are amazing too!❤️❤️❤️
More vlogs please
Thank you for taking us along so many adventures and challenges and difficult endings and new beginnings.  So happy for you and James to find your forever home and your forever family.  Only upwards!
I LOVE the vlogs!
Good Luck with your move and your new adventure in life Tati!!  Xoxo
I just ADORE watching you ❤️Thanks for showing us a little behind the scenes in your home xx
We are here for the vlogs!!
So excited for your new adventure in my birth state!! Wish you all the best Tati and James!
I’m so happy you’re back on YouTube. You’re like one of the only channels I watch now. ❤️❤️
I’m so excited for you! I’m just nervous because social media has portrayed that Texas is against women with bodily autonomy! I hope everything goes smoothly
I hope you’re coming to Dallas!! You’re going to love TX! I really enjoyed the vlog style.. hope the move went smoothly and looking forward to watching this next chapter ❤️
Love vlogs 😍
I'm so happy that your moving. in to a  bigger home💕 But we well miss having you here in Seattle😢 Big Hugs XOXO💕

It’s like a fresh wind to see some completely new from you 😍
YESSSS MORE VLOGS!!!! ❤
Welcome to Texas!
WELCOME TO TEXAS!!!! I knew it!!! You’re going to love it❤️
We loved TX when we lived there! God bless this new adventure for you and James❤️
Hi Tati, I'm happy you're doing what makes you happy, but let me tell you girl, I've been living in Tx for almost 5 yrs, I'm from LA, I'm not happy in here in Dallas, I hate the weather, too hot, too humid, too cold, tornado season sucks (right now). I don't like TexMex nothing, I HATE! HATE! BUGS, (and they bite) there's a million of them here. Can't wait for my husband to retire and move closer to CA. We have 3 acres, having lots of space is nice, people are nice, but I miss ALL of my family and friends from LA. I can't wait to see how you adjust, you will probably be a lot happier here in TX than me. Wish you the BEST! ❤️
Side note --- you are SO STUNNING without makeup sister!!! Like, GORGEOUS! ❤️‍🔥
Yessss Tati!  We need more vlogs like this.  Can’t wait to see more ❤️❤️.  Love you Tati.
Congratulations to you both on your new beginning!
Welcome to Texas! I think you’re gonna love it!! Loved the video and new content!💕
Tati yes vlogs are so fun to watch and congratulations on your new move and fresh start can’t wait to see more
I love you doing vlogs!!! More more more! Xxx
Yess I love this format
Welcome to Texas! You’ll love it! I hope you’ll tell us what area you moved to!
Welcome to the great state! Just leave your politics back home.
Congrats! Good Luck to you! Change is good 👍☺️
yasssss more tati vlogs!!!!
Tati… she can do anything. She does great beauty videos and her vlogs are so cute too!!
I loved this vlog style!! So refreshing! 💜
All the best to you
Welcome to Texas! I hope the big beautiful sunsets and wide open spaces do your soul so much good. Wishing you and James all the very best! I’ve been following you for so many years now & I feel like this new chapter will shower you with blessings. Here’s to a new beginning with some fresh Texas air 😘🥰
Can’t wIt to see where in Texas you end up! I’m in fate tx! So happy for you
I’m in San Antonio but I’m sure you’ll be either in Dallas area or Houston. Your going to love Texas!!! I actually grew up in WA across from Seattle but been in TX for 9yrs. People are the best and nicest people until they drive 🤣 It’s like moving to a whole other country honestly!! Loved the blog and can’t wait to see you annnnnndddd James more.
YESSSSS TO MORE VLOGS 🎉 Texas is somewhere my husband and I have thought about moving to for similar reason (currently in NY) so I'd love to see this transition and the behind the scenes.
I like the lifestyle video, seems fresh from the Tati we know
It’s the vlogging era and we are so here for it!❤️❤️
Good for you Tati!!!!!
I'm so excited for you guys! I've moved to many places without family and love the adventure of it. Meeting new people seeing new things!  It helped me really find my true me.
Yaaayyy WELCOME to TEXAS!! 🤠
Don't stick to the makeup! Vlogging is so much more interesting, makeup can always be included as a 'get ready in the morning before I show you my day type of thing', but definitely branch out and spice up the channel, excited to see your new chapter 😁 best wishes for the move! 😄
Love this so much!!!!!! Please keep doing vlogs x
I love seeing you be real and in sweatpants and doing real stuff
Ahhhh, Texas!! That’s where I’m from! Welcome 🤗

I'm so excited for you! Welcome to Texas!

I'm so excited for you guys! Please more vlogs!!! I live in Norcal so I understand how expensive it is here and am looking to move out of state too. I've been looking all over the Midwest and north Texas is also on my list so I can't wait to see how it is for you guys so I can get my butt into gear and get moving myself ❤️❤️❤️
God bless in Texas. Love your videos.
Love the Vlogging!!!
Yeeeessss Texas is for sure going to treat you well and you will DEFINITELY have the sun as the summer is coming up and it’ll be the ultimate test of Texas! I’m so excited for you to be in Texas and I can’t wait to see how you love it! Safe travels!!

Welcome to Texas!!!! My husband and I moved to the Houston area two years ago and have not regretted it for a second! We also moved without friends or family and started a new life. Texas is a beautiful place to start over 🤠
I loved this video! Maybe if you did this like once a week of your week and did a makeup video once or twice a week!! Thanks for sharing!! ♥️
I liked the editing in your makeup application sequence. Happy for you guys to walk into a new chapter of your lives together! Thanks for sharing, Tati.
WELCOME TO TEXAS TATI!! We are so glad to have you here!! Let’s be friends!😍
I wish you guys a great brand new journey. I missed hearing both you and your husband in a video, it's been a while and I'm glad that he's also doing good. Don't worry, it's all going to be alright since you have everything planned out for the move and your new house. Now all you need is patience. The content was really good and just a touch different from the usual, but it's a nice change!! 😊😊
I'd love to see different kinds of content from you, it'll be an adventure gworlllll 💕😁
Congratulations on your move. May God bless you and your family on this new journey. Can't wait to see the new house 🥰
Woah!!!! A blog content? I have all my notifications on? Im so late!
I love this. I WANT to see more lifestyle stuff from you.  It feels like you’ve been hidden away and I think of you as my good friend when I watch your videos. I want to know what you’re doing, how you’re decorating your, home. Everything!
Yes! Welcome to Texas!
Tati you used what looked like a lip balm as well as a lipstick which were not listed. I know you just moved.  But would you by any chance be able to identify the balm as well as the lipstick?  Love this look!  Congratulations on moving!
I’m so happy for you Tati. I lovedddd this video soo soo much. 💓✨ sending you amazing vibes and love your way!!!! Take care Tati.
I’m really looking forward to vlogs… 🤩
Please do vlogs
Thank you for the video! You have a very interesting channel! And I am 20 years old, unfortunately I am disabled, I live with my parents. I never had friends in real life, as well as relationships, I spent my whole life on the Internet. I also created a channel that can draw attention to this, though so far little has been done ((( I am writing this comment just to wish you health and good mood. Rejoice and connect with a friend. And if you suddenly feel bad at heart, remember this comment Only forward! Looking forward to your next . Good luck!
I guessed where you guys were moving to before you said it! I think it's a great idea, good luck!
Welcome to Texas!

Ahhhh!!! Yay! Welcome to Texas! 🤠
🥰😘
How did I know you were going to say Texas?! Texas is awesome but I'm a little bias lol. I live in Austin. Welcome to Texas Tati and James  ❤️ .
Ive been thinking about Texas lately. Excited to see how it goes.
Your “messy” closet is what I aspire to
Tati 🤍🤍🤍 So happy for you! Your content was everything for me in the toughest phase of my life so far & I love you & your content so much. I hope to see you in Texas soon! 🤎
Sigggg - maaaa lol
Can I just say how much I miss James??? So happy for you guys! But yeah hi James miss seeing you on cam!
Yup I liked the Vlog/ day! Tati one thing, please consider seat belting your puppy in. God forbid you should be in an accident what would happen to anyone not wearing a seatbelt? All kinds of devices, being a Pom mom I love the chair and harness combo. Thanks good luck with your move.
I liked the vibe! And thanks for the new song I added to my playlist :) Last video...I guessed Texas!
I'm so excited for your big adventure!!! Praying Texas brings all the changes you need and much prosperity!!!!!!!
And yes to more vlogs!!
Such a cute video! Congrats xx ❤️
I was kind of expecting you to move to a Carolina but how exciting for you guys!
You’re going to love TX!! That’s where I live. ☺️
The old place is cute, but small. Particularly when You do what You do !! Good Luck with the move !! I hope You like Texas, I didn't, give Me Cali any day !!
Yes Texas!! That’s where I am! You’ll love it!! No better place!
Congrats on the move, please don’t vote democrat because the reason Texas has the 4th lowest tax burden is due to its conservative state leaders keeping the overall taxes low and they cut taxes (while Cali democrats raise taxes) during economic downturns instead of dipping into the state’s savings account. Keep Texas Red.
Awww yay!! Im so happy for you guys!!  Best wishes to you both, Tati.💛 My sister lives in Texas.  I'm sure guys will love it!!   Also , I genuinely loved this. So happy to see you guys happy!  I hop you all find zen in your new place.
Congratulations on your move! So glad to see you so happy and looking towards the future! Can’t wait to see you in your new studio and place! Many blessings!!
love you Tati you got this <3
Can you please share the video about the mirror I missed it on your IG
Best of luck you and James on your move and your new home and a fresh start! ♥️☺️

Yessss please for part 2. Thank you for sharing with us.
I LOVE THIS STYLE OF VIDEO!!! Keep doing it 🤍
Welcome to Texas!!!!

Def a new chapter for you both
What candles do you recommend? Have you done a video on that already?
I’ll watch all your videos but I got so excited for a vlog! I think we’re all here for it all! Just wish it wasn’t “only” 20 minutes long 😅😂 sending love to all reading this!
I don't understand why ANYONE would move to Texas these days! The place where there's no reproductive justice!? Where trans kids and their families live in terror? Gross.
100% vlog! Be safe
I will also love for you to do lives doing your makeup so we can really be with you and tell you this or that, or maybe do a first impression on live so we can be with you while you do it and maybe give you advice or something ! I love you!
Yassss I love to see you in real life

I know what Indians must be thinking 😂
My mouth literally dropped at Texas. So excited.

I am so excited for you and your family!  My family wants to move to a place with space, a safe space for our kids to go visit friends by themselves,  comfortability with our city, and beautiful views.  We are thinking of moving to Wyoming, Montana, or the South.  I hope moving and renovating go well!
So happy for you and James, a brand new start, thank you for sharing ❤️
Welcome to the great state of TEXAS! Great choice Tati!
I got excited when you said Texas! It’s a beautiful place to live. You’re going to love it Tati!  The Lone Star State is the place to be 🥰
More content like this…yes please :)
I don’t even know where to start.. I loved every single little thing about this video! I loved getting to see more of your personality and the behind the scenes look into your life.  You are funny and gorgeous and very entertaining! Also, I’m super into the home reno/decorating stuff right now, so I CANNOT wait to watch those videos!! Please do more vlogs! You’re so good at it🦋🤍
Proof that I need to move out of state! We love you Tati 🥲💜🙏🏾
My sister left  our hometown in the PNW for Texas last year and is so much happier there, she says people are so much more real and friendly…wishing you the best
Good luck with you move!  I loved your first vlog, keep them coming!!
We just moved from TX to FL last week, long distance moves can be so stressful, just remember to live in the moment and take in the scenery along the way ❤️
Well, from a 7th generation Texan……Welcome to Texas!  I’m in Central Texas so I’m 60 miles north of Austin, 2 hours south of DFW & a little over 3 hours from Houston.  By now, you have figured out Texas is a little unruly with the extremes…..from life-threatening wildfires to a string of tornadoes tonight (3/21/2022)….all within 1 week!   Settle in, enjoy the bluebonnets & other wildflowers that will begin to blanket many areas of the state this month & take care!
please do a weekly vlog…pleeeaasseee!  even if on a new channel if people here for makeup get cranky.. Also please can you collab with Graveyard Girl Bunny when in Texas.. 🙏
I really like this style of video where you have lifestyle mixed in but a sped up almost tutorial makeup application. Also love the music choices 👌  Can't wait to see how you style your new home!
I am so glad to see that I am not the only person in the world who is so unorganized before a move. I thought everyone else's house was completely in order while packing, boxes in order labeled,  put into.truck and the empty house looks like a model home.
you & James can do it!
TEXAS!!!! Yes!!!!  I'm so happy for you two!!!!  Honey, you have "friends" everywhere... literally everywhere.  They will find you and welcome you with open arms.  That reminds me of a song.... lol ♪♫♪
Yay !!! Tati congratulations on the move. I am in Texas. You will love it here.  This is the place where blessings are made 🥰 Please if you ever need anything or have questions I would love to help.  I know you may not need help. But so you know you have friends in the south and we all love being on the new journey with you.  You deserve the best. ❤️. You will love it here.  Thanks Hugs Always. Vero-
I knew she was a republican
Yeah!! I'm a Texan and living in North Central Texas where I grew up, worked all over the world but Texas is home.
Loved this video! I like the more casual style, I think it fits you’re fresh start!
Love the vlog
Loveeeeee this for you. So happy to see all the positivity and change. Love the vlog style, love your attitude, and can’t wait to see what’s next!
We’ll miss you here in WA🥺  enjoy ur new home!❤️
Thank you for sharing 😊 nice to see you having fun, and letting us peep a bit into your private life 👍 it's inspiring tbh 🤔☺️
Good for you! Onward and upward!
Yay…….welcome to TEXAS! You will love it. ….❤️
Congratulations 🎊
Tati I looooovee that you are back and this kind of video Is so great!! I miss your CVS and Walgreen coupon videos too lol... excited to see you guys move and can I say I really think you are one of the greatest MUA on here. Watching you apply your makeup is calming in a way. Congratulations on moving to texas!! 🥰
Good luck on your new journey 💕
Texas🇨🇱 welcomes you. More vlogs please. Safe travels
😍😍😍
the vlog was awesome , it was shot and edited beautifully . I would really like to see more of them
Congratulations! I’m so excited for you guys and your new chapter.
All the best on this new chapter!
Yayyy…welcome to Texas!! You ll love it
Hey Tati, I'm from corpus Christy TX, miss it sooooo much. You will Love the southern food and you have to try a whataburger... Keep doing the Vlogs, we all Love them. Congratulations girl on your happiness, and hope you have a Very Blessed move. Can't wait for the next Vlog 😊❤👏🏽👏🏽
I love these type of vlog videos!! 💓💓
💕
I am sooo excited to see what's coming. On a side note I gotta say it's kinda funny to hear what Tati considers as not very big and tight 😂
Congratulations on your move! Wishing you happiness, peace and success in your journey. 🥰
I love the vlogging video!!
This townhouse is awesome, wish we had seen it more before you moved out. It’s the dream here in Seattle
OMG!! I can’t believe you going yo be on TX!!!  Born & raised Texan & even though I have no clue where you will (it’s a huge state), I hope someday I’ll run into you.  Wishing y’all nothing but the best in greatest state!!!
I can’t wait to see your new house..🏡
Good luck in your new venture with your new place. Texas is a very nice place to live. Muah! ❤
OMG I moved to texas 5 years ago by myself didnt kow anyone here either!!!  Im stilll here so thats a good sign lol. Also I  loveee this style of video where you take us around with you and share more about every day life.  And not just be solely in the studio.  Please share more!!!!
My friend said he saw you in target in my hometown in Texas and I didn’t believe him- now I just might 😂
WELCOME TO TEXAS ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life898
Texas does have great food.
So happy for you! Welcome to Texas, Tati! I’m in Texas too. So happy you came back to YouTube!
Tati!!!!! I’m so excited you’re coming to Texas!! 🤠 you’re gonna love it here! ❤️💙
Love it Tati!! That you’re moving and starting over!! And for sure we will enjoy your vlogs 💓👏🏽
Can’t wait to watch you bloom bright in Texas. My daughter lives there. My first time in Texas, I was exhausted by the time we saw the Welcome to Texas sign!! Thank goodness. Then my son tells me we still had 9 hours left in the car before getting to my daughters house! Lol. Yeah, Texas is HUGE!!!!
Yaas, more vlogs! I wish you all the best in your new journey!
I moved to a different continent not knowing anyone and not speaking the language and it was a fun adventure!!! I loved every minute of it. So going from Seattle to Texas will be easy Peasy! Plus since everyone is moving to Texas.. who knows.. maybe you will run into people you already know from LA and Seattle. Lol. Enjoy the ride!!
Yes we want more of you.....the make up is the icing on the cake. Showing your ups ups ups and hopefully no more downs is uplifting to folks sitting in their at home work cubicals taking in your life saying, "One day I will be just like you when I grow up." LOL, I am older than you!!!
Are we ever going to see James in your videos again? 🥺
Can’t wait for your new adventure😍
Welcome to Texas!!!
Okay I have been following you for years now. Needless to say I love your content. In my head I was thinking “maybe TN.. yeah TN sounds like them. Maybe who knows” but when you said Texas I gasped! I live in Texas and I’m so excited for you all! Hope you love it here and can’t wait to see more Vlogs. Love the Vlog video by the way, I would watch all of them
Texas! I called it! Seems like everyone is moving there now! The PNW will miss you Tati, enjoy the heat!
Super stoked for you guys. Fresh start is exactly what your soul needs. Bless.
Love u Tati!
I love videos like these! Also soo happy for you!
I hope you got that fourth popsicle. You deserve it!! Hope you find peace and feel right at home in Texas!❤️
More vlog pls!
Welcome to Texas, Tati! Born and raised 🙌 The Summers are long, humidity is high and the mosquitoes are bird size. Tex-Mex is a staple. We say hi to strangers, so don't be alarmed if someone says hello or smiles at you, you don't have anything in your teeth. We have pride in our state so don't be surprised if you see flags on every house or on most trucks. We drive fast and crazy so be careful on the road. You will love it! So happy for you and glad you chose Texas!
Yes! Good luck I am so excited to you guys! It’s so awesome to see pooka and James again I am loving the vlogs
This vlog was so good! I hope that you can get to do more 🥰 absolutely enjoyed seeing you in your element in a day!
Nothing beats a Texas sunset!! I’m so happy for you and James! Welcome to Texas y’all! 🤠
Welcome to Texas and our Crazy weather. I'm in Texas too and wouldn't it be crazy if we ended up being neighbors?
My move to TX from NY was the best decision I made. Welcome to Texas, Tati! Wishing you all the best on your new journey.
Oh honey, said in my best Southern as I’m from MS, you can leave most of those cold weather clothes behind. Your moving to Hades, you’re going to want to be naked once you get a good taste of the heat and humidity.  Congratulations on your new journey, may all your dreams come true.
More vlogs!!!! Pease
Love the vloging! And welcome to Texas sis! 🎉
Love the vlog style!!! It was like your wear tests from way back but even better because we get to share the excitement of a new chapter with you!
No one tell her about tarantulas in Texas!!!
❤😍
Check our gateway church or MERCY CULTURE! It’s the best!
Congrats Tatiana, sounds fun! Pooka is so cute (;
Excited for you! My family lives in Arkansas!! There's definitely some great places in Texas! Wishing you well in your new chapter!
Omgg we are living in Seattle and are from here but moving to Texas too in a couple years!! So many people are moving there
Good luck, Tati!!!
I had a feeling you were going to Texas. Hope you love it! Extremely nice people there. I love love the vlog so so much. I hope to see you do many more.
WELCOME TO TEXAS TATI!!!❤️
I love vlogs, please keep them coming
Texan here. I think your personality and sweet spirit will fit in perfectly here. Welcome home! 🤗
Get ready for the heat! Texas heat is not kind to anyone.
Excited to watch your new vlogging!!!  LOVE this new format and I’m so excited for the future!  Predicting a very bright future!!!  Love you girl!  XO’S Lauren
I guessed that last week. So obvious.
Congratulations Tati to your new chapter in life!
I can say I enjoy these!
I love if you start vlogging! Wish you a fresh happy start! Hugs!
Yes to vlogs like this! 😃
You look beautiful too.
Love this type of content thank y ok u for sharing with us!! 💞♥️
Wow! Congratulations to you, James and your pup on the move and new state. So exciting! Loved the look you created. Your dog is adorable. My pup freaks when he sees suitcases and his "house," his big carrier. It looks like you're on your way with the packing. Beautiful piano.
Welcome to Texas! So excited for you!
I am so happy for you Tati!! ❤️
Come to Texas, gurl!  It’s nice and red here and a church on every corner.  Praying for you to find nice people and a great church where your faith can grow!
You’re moving here and I want to move to the PNW! Ha! I’m so tired of Texas!
I just KNEW it was TX. It's very family friendly. Enjoy your new adventures!
LOVE the vlog content! I do not come here for the makeup, I come here for YOU, Tati! The vlog content feels really personal and makes watching your videos feel like being on a zoom call with your BFF or something. Your makeup reviews are always great, but please continue to do a vlog style video alongside. I hope the move was easy breezy and I know Texas will be good to you! <3 Love and light to you!
I really liked this!!
Keep up the vlogs Tati! I love seeing more of your life :) Good luck with the move!
Love it❤️
Please more vlogs we love them 💗 ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
WELCOME TO TEXAS TATI!!! youll love it here. Praying your travels are safe, your movers are blessed & efficient. May this transition of moving be smooth & happy. Lifes a journey but when Jesus takes us in new directions always know..God is with you all the way. May your gorgeous new home be a blessing to ALL who enter it. Super Happy for you & James.
yayy welcome for Texas!! so glad you are going to take care of land of Texas
I was so hoping your ring would turn up in the move but I’m glad you made your peace with it - at least you and James still have each other and that’s what matters.
Moving is so freaking stressful, I literally have moving nightmares lmao
My heart sinks just a little every time I hear another LA influencer is moving to Texas. Texas is as good as it is for a R-eason. Please don’t forget it.
That’s a huge closet to me 😂
You are one of the very first channels on youtube I ever watched and I'm just so happy for you and your little family. It's been amazing seeing your transformation and I love seeing this more open and personal side! Happy travels and prayers for as little stress as possible! You deserve this fresh start and I'm here for any content you create 💜love organizing, house remodeling, lifestyle, fashion do what makes you happy!
I loved this vlog!! Please do more 😍🤩 You seem so uplifted and happy about your new start. Im so excited for you and can’t wait to go on your journey with you! 💖🦋💫✨
I love Tati and her happiness but I have to say it Peter Monn called it! To the vloging & moving somewhere sunny 🌞 💙💙💙💜💜💜 yay! 💐
Pooka saying yeehaw is my fave
I think it's natural for content to change over time. My viewing interests have definitely changed and I would love more vlogs! Especially moving and new home stuff.
The fact that I will be living in the same state as Tati and could potentially run into her 😍
Please girl show us more videos like this!!! Loved it!! Good luck with the move!!🥰
Omg welcome to Texas!! Your gonna love it here!!
PukaShell was the real MVP of the vlog for the encouragement and positivity.
So happy for this new chapter! I loved this video.
Great video 👍. I am waiting for the part 2
i'm all about the vlog life these days!
Welcome to Texas❤️
Literally everybody is moving to Texas!
I can’t believe you have a Steinway 😂 goals
Love all your vids!! 👍💚😍
Love this type of video.  You're gonna love Texas and Texas loves you already!
Welcome!
Everyone is moving to taxes just don’t turn it into California… lol
Tati you look so excited about the move, is so heartwarming to see the joy, and you deserve even more. Prayers & much love your way!
Change is great I’m excited for you. Texas is Hugh lots of people are moving there
Omg I live in Houston! And this has me excited!  Which city!!!!!
Love the vlog Tati. AND I love Texas! I’m from Canada and I’ve been to TX several times. I especially love Austin♥️
Great another one 🤦🏿‍♂️
I’m still so pissed target Canada bombed and got closed down, I want sigma in stores!
Damn it… you are moving to Texas… I live here but I’m moving to Florida! 😖 uuuugh!!! So close! Lol
Waiting for part 2!
LOVE THIS Tati Vlog!!!  🥰🥳
Texas has some nice places. At this time I couldn't move there because they have taken away a woman's right to her body and to make choices. When that changes I will rethink moving to Texas.
I would've thought you lived in a much bigger home. It was kind of a surprise but not in a bad way. It was very nice to see your living space.
LOVE LOVE LOVE your vblog format it makes me feel like I’m watching a tv show. I missed your vlogs ❤️
My guesses were Texas or North Carolina!
I just moved from Washington to Texas too!! Loving it here! Such an exciting new journey 🥳
Welcome!  I live in Texas!  I think you and James will really love it here!  Best wishes to you both!
Safe travels! Glad you're sharing this. Prayers for you and James. BTW, TX has spiders. :)
Welcome to Texas! However, we are all currently on fire.
Yayyyyyy for Texas !!!! I’m can’t for your next adventure !!! Loved this video !!!
Tati I’m SO excited for you !! This move is going to be such a blessing for you guys .. I’m secretly sad you’re not moving to Colorado , cuz that’s where I am , but Texas will be lucky to have you ! Praying for nothing but good weather , good health , and great new friends and adventures in this new chapter of your life . And PLEASE keep the vlogs coming ! I’m SO here for it all 🤩✨love you tati ! 🤍🤍🤍
Good luck with your move. I feel like you would be a good match to collab with Dominique Sachse another favorite youtuber of mine in Houston👍. Safe travels😀🙏
I adore watching you move up and on with your life. It’s so heartwarming to see ❤️
SO excited you're coming to Texas! Welcome!! You're gonna love it! Have you found a good church?
I was just there a week ago!! I knew that had to be where you were headed after talking about needing the Sun. I just had a feeling.  I have no idea what part you are in now but hope the crazy weather hasn’t been near!
Eeekkkkkk WELCOME TO TEXAS!! You’ll love it and never wanna leave!
Welcome to Texas, Tati! 🤠⭐️🏠🎉
I love the blogs it is cool and have a safe trip moving and can’t wait to see the next video xo
Welcome to Texas Tati! I know you will love it!!! 🥰🥰🥰
Omg!! You are coming to my state. I haven’t got to the part where you mention the city…if you even do. Texas will be just a little bit sweeter with you, James and Puka.  Yay!!!!
I AM DYING!!! My heart told me you would come to Texas and YALL WILL LOVE IT!! I’m a Land specialist REALTOR in North-East Texas and there are so many incredible investment opportunities and so so many incredibly kind hearted, god loving people. Not to mention the Tex-Mex! Welcome to Texas, can’t wait to follow your amazing new journey. 😍😍😍
Yes, part 2 please!
I love vlogs, congrats on the move!
Can you say what neighborhood you lived in?
I hope you find/found your ring! I'm so excited for this next chapter and can't wait to see your new place...best of luck with the move, time for a change and some wide open spaces.  Love this new vlog style too!
Welcome to Texas
Woo Hoo!! So excited for you guys. Your brave to move to that heat, but I can understand the want for sunshine. A new start can be Amazing!!
Texas💜
Welcome to Texas. ❤️💙
You will be fine....you are gonna love it and be happy. Starting anew and fresh is exciting!! Much success to you and James!! I can't wait- we can't wait - to be part of your journey!! God bless your journey. Xo
Omg good luck with the move and everything ❤️❤️❤️❤️
So excited for you!  My husband and I moved to Texas in 2012 for college with the intention of moving elsewhere.  However, 10 years later and we are still here and love it.
Congrats! New move, new beginnings, new blessings🥳🥳🥳
Absolutely LOVED this whole Vlog style! It was so relaxed real and more personal …. I just enjoyed feeling along for the ride ! Super happy for you both! Texas! Wow!!! I can totally see you riding horses and wearing a apron and cooking! Decorating and wearing Texas style clothing! What fun! 😍🥰☺️ Enjoy this awesome new chapter! Savor all the new exciting moments! Follow the Holy Spirit as he takes ya’ll on a new adventure! Sending prayers hugs and love 💕 and well wishes! You got this!!
Welcome to Texas! Please do a meet up there 🥺
I miss seeing Pucca!!!! 💕
Holy spirit activate🙏🏽❤️🇨🇦😘 manifest!
Yehaw! Welcome to Texas!!
Welcome to Texas!
I watch pretty much anything you're willing to post Tati. Enjoy your channel very much!
YAAAAY!!! Looking forward to more vlogs on the new move and new chapter! <3 <3
Omg!! So happy you guys are moving here❤ you're going to love it here. Summer sucks but I wouldn't live anywhere else. Congratulations!
Yes Yes Yes I love the lifestyle vlog!!
👀 Tati what’s your starbs order ?👀 I can tell just based off color it’s good LOL
I am so happy and excited for you , James and Puka
First of all, you don’t use “you guys” in Texas! We say y’all! I love your vlogging! I used to love it when you vlogged in the drug stores! Please do more vlogging!
You could call your new studio "Studio 7". Yes, it is simple. But hear me out. To some cultures, the number 7 is considered lucky. And then you have 7 Wonders of the World, the number 7 often represents completeness and perfection in the Bible by various scholars. So maybe this move of yours with the 7th studio may be the perfect one that will definitely be your grounding roots. All the best to you and to your new chapter.
I know James does not want to come up for a video but it is just so nice to hear his voice once in a while!
I guessed it, Texas lol! ❤️😘
I LOVE THIS! Super excited for you! Share what you feel comfortable sharing... I would love to see it all lol. Wishing you all the best!
Omg yes to more vlogs !! I love it bc❤️❤️❤️
Texas is *HUGE*  !  Are you North South East or Well I know you are not West because there is nothing here but tumbleweeds I just moved to TX five months ago it's still growing on me love the people love the food but I should have moved to a larger city.  Best of luck to you, James and Puca you all are going to fit right in!
Yay!!! Welcome to Texas! We're happy to have you!
This is so real!! I love it~~ So happy to see this vlog. Keep it going~~~
Born and raised Texan here! Welcome!! It’s a great place! I live in west Texas and the weather changes all the time lol! Love you Tati!
Moved from Portland, OR to Dallas last year. Best thing I’ve ever done. Best of luck to you Tati 👍👍👍
I’m so happy for you!!! 😭♥️ welcome to Texas! 🤠👍🏽
I love this style of video (in addition to the others). Texas is a whole other world compared to the west coast. Of course you can make this move! You've got this!👍
I will watch anything you upload I am so excited ❤️❤️
Moving is the worst! We did it in August, and it’s been hard to find/make new friends. Best of luck to you and James! And Outshine bars are the best!
Love the vlogging! Best wishes and love on your new adventure! ❤️
Congratulations to the both of you❤️❤️❤️
I'm living the vlogging!! Keep it coming!! I'm so excited for your adventure and I miss seeing James too!!❤️❤️❤️
Love it! Sending good vibes for this new adventure! 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
I live in Texas and when you said Texas I was like, “Oh my gosh it would be amazing to meet you if I ever saw you IRL!” So exciting to see this new chapter of your life! 💕💕💕
I love this! Please do vlogs every step of the way!!! ❤️❤️
Love the vlog format, keep ‘em coming!
Woohoo! So excited you’re in Texas! ❤️💙😁
Welcome to Texas! From so much of what you've said in the past, I really think you're going to love it here. I'm very biased, but I think it's just what you were looking for!
We love the vlogging! Please keep sharing everything else too!
Born and raised in Austin, Texas.  I hope you like hot sweaty summers.
I ❤️ LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS CONTENT tati!!!! 😀 yes girl. Own it!!!
So so happy for you tati and James
Wish you the very best in your new place Tati!!!💖 I know exactly how you feel, I moved 3 , 4 times a year for my husband job, for 15 years. It does get overwhelming at times but God will give you the strength to finish all your packing🙏🙏🙏🥰 Congratulations on your new home!!!🥰👏🎉
Best of luck.  Love the video.
HEY TATI, I AM RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO YOU IN LOUISIANA. YOU AND JAMES MUST COME OVER FOR GREAT CAJUN FOOD AND FESTIVALS LIKE JAZZ FEST IN NEW ORLEANS AND MARDI GRAS. I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU BOTH AND I HOPE YOUR NEW PLACE BRINGS YALL MUCH JOY AND PEACE. LOVE YOUR FRIEND IN CHRIST JESUS PENNI D❤️
WELCOME TO TEXAS TATI!! 🥳🎉
I’m in Texas!! Welcome! We have H‑E‑B which is the best grocery store chain and Whataburger— WAY better than in and out lol what part of Texas are y’all moving too?
Welcome home 🖤 Texas is happy to have you!!
Texas isss the besttttt😭💕
YAAAAS join me in texas my queen! youre gonna love it :DD so many kind hospitable people
Did the move from Wa to Tx 2 years ago at the height of the pandemic. You will miss the rain at the height of summer but the morning sunshine here will amaze you. Mornings are my favorite and Texas sunsets are incredible.
Omg, I love the vlogging side of Tati. Thank you for giving us a tour of your old space. So excited for you, James and Pookah to start this new chapter. I’ve been a loyal subscriber for over 5 years and you are one of my favorite people to watch. May God bless you and your family 🤍
I’m so excited for you guys! I love this and I hope to see more vids like these!!! 😍, no place better than TEXAS!!! ❤️
omg welcome to Texas! I weirdly had a feeling you were moving to tx or somewhere southern. Funny you mention you love the weather when it's currently absolutely HEINOUS but maybe it'll lighten up for you lol
I just had this feeling you were moving to texas . Welcome to Texas. Howdy . You will love it here. In texas. There is so much to do here. I so wish you and james ( y',all) 😉 the best in this new adventure.  You so deserve a new fresh start.😍😃❤
Hey Tati! Up at 11:54pm and watching your vlog. We love being a part of your life journey ✨️💕!!!
I LOVED this video! We need more 🙂
Definitely keep doing these vlog style videos!
I need to comment on the editing and music... this video was QUALITY CONTENT
I lived in Southern California my entire life until I was 47 when I relocated to Texas and only knew 2 people here... I love the people of Texas and the slower pace of life here. I'm sure you'll love it and you must check out Grapevine texas during Christmas time... It's the Christmas capital of TX!
I love this format! It’s refreshing. The music was also perfect! And relaxing!
Welcome to Texas! I am in Texas and would be happy to be friends 😁 I think you will LOVE it here!
Absolutely loved the vlog style! This is the Tati we need more of. We love the makeup too, don’t stop that completely, we need your insight and thoughts on all of it still, but we need more vlogs too! I am so happy to see you making such positive moves in your life, you just seem so much happier since coming back last summer, and I can’t wait for the Texas content. I think you and James will thrive there. Also, can’t wait to see you get back to playing the piano and singing. Onward and upward! Love you Tati 🤗
❤️Godspeed❤️
Do not throw away makeup if so throw it my way 😂😂😂😂🚜🤠🚜🤠🤠🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
WELCOME TO TEXAS!!!!!!!
i would really love more vlogs like this. im trying to move as well and everything about it is soooo stressful even though im very excited to move
I'm so happy for you and a little jealous at the same time! I've never been to Texas, but I sure want to! Good luck to you and James!
Tati I loved this! This was my first Vlog?!? Best of luck to you! It’s great sometimes to have everything be new and all becomes adventure! Kiss Puka for me. Also, I see you as more than a makeup artist, you seem like that friend we all wish we had but many do not- you are doing good works! Hope you continue but no pressure lol. 😘
My husband and I just moved to Texas from Washington too! Although my husband still has to travel back to Seattle every couple weeks because our company is still there. We love it here!
Yay! That means maybe I’ll get to meet you IRL one day! Oklahoma girl, but it can happen! Best of luck on your new move!
Yay I live in Texas too lol it’s so dang hot lol but it’s definitely sunny most of the time
You can definitely do vlogs but not have to show too much of your private life! Your type of vlog is fun and calming! I often like to play vlogs in the background for company while I do laundry and the dishes. It's like a nice catch up with a friend and being productive at the same time.  Hoping for easy packing and moving for you guys! You can do it!
Enjoying the process.  Thank you for sharing with us.  Good luck on your new adventure.
We love vlogs like this!! Thank you for sharing ❤️
Omg!!! I’m so happy you’re moving to Texas!!! I’m praying I run into you!!!!! 🙏🏼💜
So happy for you I moved from Texas to Washington 6 months ago and I miss it so much, you will love it!!! Please go have a Whataburger for me. Love this personal blog style for you as well. Best of luck in Texas.
And you're not a professional vlogger?! Girl you could've fooled me haha this was great 10 out of 10 will watch again 😋
Welcome to Texas!!!!!!!!!!!!! So excited for you!
I’d love to see a healthy variety of makeup, food and sights in your new city and manifesting a baby vlog. 🙏
I like both !! I love seeing both sides !!! Please do makeup as well !
I absolutely loved this vlog. Can't wait for more of these!
wishing you guys the best, exciting wow
Welcome to Texas Tati I don’t know why I had a feeling you’d move here when you said sunny I’m so happy that’s you’re moving here I wish you all the best here I hope you find whatever you’re looking for in life 💕💕💕💕
Don’t ever be sorry for being cautious, safe & smart about not showing ur home bc sadly there’s some scary ppl out there. U can never be too safe. On that note, I really enjoyed this vlog & been wishing since I started watching you to see ur life kinda behind the scenes/not bout the makeup/ur normal day to day life. I really hope u continue to do more vlogs bc I absolutely LOVED it. I love this Tati. Happier, more at peace, more laid back (not that u weren’t before I just mean after u took ur break, u seem so much more relaxed and the best we’ve ever seen). Please do more vlogs! I love this. Good luck on the next chapter of ur life. Puka will LOVE the bigger back yard 🙂 But if there’s any hawks like in Washington, plz be outside with him. My god I never knew bout that until I watched ur video a few back & u spoke bout it. The comments scared the shit outta me! Good luck beauty 🤍
Loved this video❤️
So happy you’re coming to Texas!  It’s the best!   Blogs are my favorite - keep ‘‘em coming,
Love seeing this side of your life! And omg puka!!!!! I missed him 🥰🥰 thank you so much for sharing your life with us! So excited and happy for your new start ☺
I love this vlog style Tati!!! Feels more personal and behind the scenes!
I had a feeling you were moving to Texas!! 🤭🤭 I’m in Louisiana so I’m all for moving to the south. 😍💕💋
I am so happy you and James rekindled your love and passion for each other. I prayed for that with my ex husband that we would have reconnected. But it’s been 11 years and nothing yet, but neither of us have moved on either. A girl can hope! I’m happy for you!  I could only pray for your wedding ring to show up.
Seattle is insanely expensive. I moved from CA to Texas and am glad I did.
I enjoyed this content!
You will love Texas! You won’t have to wear that mask anymore! We are in Alabama and haven’t worn a mask in a year or more!! Congrats on the move and getting space!!
So happy for you both, congratulations Tati. Much Love 🖤🤍🖤🤍
So happy for you guys Tati! I can’t wait to see where this journey takes you 💖 xoxo!
Welcome to Texas! So excited for you to start your journey here!
No don’t stick to the makeup. Do different things. Thank you.
God Blessed Texas… ♥️ This vlog was amazing! Love it!
Texas! ❤️ I’m so jelly! I would love to live there. Congrats y’all on your new home and I’m so looking forward to seeing your new adventures. God Bless always
Welcome to Texas! From DFW as long as not here we be okay! 🥰🥰🥰
WELCOME TO TEXAS!!!  So excited to have you here!
Omg me too! In a big move myself from Florida to Australia!  I have a 4 month period in-between... visiting family all over the US. Nevada California and my grown kids in Hawaii back to Nevada say good bye to my small puppy's for a month till they can join us. So yeah I know. And 2 big suitcases of makeup totting along with me.. uggg. Can't wait to get settled down. But I know it will be awesome! Good luck to you and hope you love it in Texas.
So glad you are coming to Texas. Texas born and raised and I can’t think of ever living anywhere else!
❤️🤍💙
Love it!
So happy for you and James xx
I’m so excited for you!!! I lived in Texas for 5 years... The Dallas /Fort Worth area. Loved it... You must go to a Central Market, it's amazing. So many other suggestions if you are going to be in that area.
Loved all the Puka cameos! Best of luck to you as always!!! Life is such a journey.
I hope to one day bump into you here in Texas 🥰 More vlogs please!!
I thought you might be moving to Hawaii. Texas seems like a great fit for you and your soon to be growing family. Have a wonderful adventure.
Welcome to Texas
I LOVE THE VLOGS! I love the makeup too, but both is so good!
Not surprised that seeing you vloging brought a smile to my face. Keep it up, queen❤️
Austin? Frisco? Dallas? San Antonio?  😜. We are neighbors now as I’m from Louisiana.  I know you’ll love the south and I look forward to your sweatproof makeup videos.  Hot AF here July through September.  Good food though and very hospitable people.
💜💜💜 I’m so excited 😆  I just went through it. 🥺 Dad just died and next day Auntie etc … I live in LA and we’ve been having similar discussions lately about relocating and starting somewhere fresh & new. First place.. Texas. I saw this after coming home from 2nd funeral this week, sad & totally drained mentally & physically and thinking 🤔 I want that. I do. My nephew just moved from Connecticut to Austin & I have tons of family in Seattle (lol almost moved there a couple times over the years) but anyway… I’m so excited for you guys!! I will live vicariously through you both & want to see it all. All of the things lol  💜🥰 Xoxo  No, not just make up.. everything.  Love you so much. I’ve been watching you since wayyyy back in time and I’ll always be a fan and kind of friend forever.
I love this content more a view into the real unedited you...it's seems more natural then just all makeup content...love ya Tati wish you all the best in your new journey
lol i think its just so funny that Tati uses the dyson airwrap as a face fan 😂
Welcome to Texas!! We are so excited to have you here in the lone star state ❤️❤️
Please share anything you would like to share Tati. I'm from Houston texas and you will love Texas. Welcome 🙏 I send you love and positive vibes in your new journey.  🥰
Welcome to Texas!  I hope you love it as much as I do.  I've lived here almost my entire life & couldn't imagine living anywhere else.
Love this side SOOOOO MUCH!
❤️❤️❤️
I was totally wrong with my guess. I guessed Oregon.
This was fantastic! So happy for y’all!
I moved to Texas on a whim almost 10 years ago! I was only there a short time but it was so healing. I love Texas. Best of luck you guys ❤️❤️
Cannot wait to come along on this adventure with you!!!!
Love your vloggin! Thank you! And congrats on you and James' new place! Yay!
Yay! So excited that we get to have Tati in Texas! 🥳🥳👏🏼🥰
I love the vlog situation. Please make vlogs frequently 😍
Love it, join the texas life 💕
Yay!!! I live in Oklahoma, I’ve lived in Texas most of my marriages it’s beautiful! You’ll love it! Congrats on the new move! You look so happy!
I LOVED this video! Pleaseeee more vlogs! I’m in Alabama, so not close to Texas but when you said you’re moving to Texas I was like “OMG! She’s close to me now!” 😂😂😂
I JUST HAD THIS FEELING IT WAS TEXAS!! Oh it would be a dream to be your neighbor 🥰😍 will you tell us the city eventually?? I’m in Grapevine, just next to DFW airport!
Tati, I guessed wrong. Thought you'd be moving to Nashville.  Now I'm guessing that you're moving near Dallas. Yes? You'll definitely vibe there. Wishing you the best with your move. Embrace the chaos. 💋
See you in Texas. ❤️❤️❤️
I have lived in WA all my life. Granted we live in a small town t south of Seattle so we have farm life but We visited TX for the first time last April and fell in love. Would love to leave here. Someday. :)
This video makes me SMILE 😊😌 How exciting for you guys!!! Love you Tati & James!
I went to graduate school and met my husband in Texas, we moved to San Jose for a year and a half for my first job, we are now back to Texas for 5 years. So glad to be back in Texas. You will enjoy the south here 🥰
Tbh this is my fav video yet

Yes Tati!! I love this kind of content & I can’t wait to see you in the sunshine… I can tell it will be good for your soul 🤍
Native Texan here saying, Welcome & Howdy! I hope y’all love living here as much as I always have. I’m 42. Married 23 years w/ 3 girls. My husband works in city management which means we tend to move every 3-5 years. We’ve lived from North Texas to South Texas (currently in Hill Country area) 9 homes and 5 cities. We’ve been happy everywhere we’ve lived and I hope and pray y’all have the same experience as us. PS- we just bought 2 acres w/ an amazing view of the hills.
Please please please more vlogs
As a Native Texan, WELCOME TO TEXAS! You will love it here❤️❤️❤️
sp happy for you!!! Cannot wait to see your space!
TEXAS!!!!  So, excited.  I moved from FL to Austin in '93 sight unseen and still love it.  Lots of sun and open spaces.  I cannot wait to find out what part of TX, it is a big state, and March is a lovely time, the Bluebonnets are starting to pop up and soon we will be carpeted in wildflowers.  I really like this hybrid vlog/get ready format.  Mix it up babe and make it yours.
Yes, a Part 2 please :) 🥰
Im so excited for the house tour! Please vlog your renovations it would be so nice to see the transformations
I hope everything arrived safe and sound. Looking forward to watching you in Texas.
Moving is STRESSFUL!  Texas, people are so NICE there! You will love it!
i love this blog!!!! yes!!!!
Welcome to the South!!
I love vlogs as well as makeup content. Fingers crossed for your ring to turn up somewhere when you fully unpack.
I'm happy you've found a place to plant roots, but going from liberal states to a conservative state might be a culture shock for you. Unless that's what you want of course. Good luck!!
I knew it was gonna be Texas!!!
This video was great. Real life. Good luck moving.
Like the vlog very much. Thank you for sharing this journey with us. And …travel safe. Looking forward to the next stop on the way!  Xo
Love this!
I cannot believe we’re seeing Tati from this different of a lens, BUT IM LOVING IT 😇😅 love how you’re involving lifestyle w makeup just like the old days on your YouTube channel 💞
usually i don’t like/watch vlogs but i will watch anything you put out
I moved to Texas 2 years ago with my husband and our cats.
Whoohoo!  Welcome to Texas!  You will love it here!
I live in the amazing state of Wets Virginia and I LOVE IT!!!  We have always said if we could bring our whole family (we have the most delicious grand babies) and move to one other place so I don't have to deal with winter it would be somewhere in the great state of Texas!  I am so excited for you and I hope everything goes wonderful and praise The Lord you will be so happy in your new home!!  💕💕💕💕💕💕
I am so excited to see your new house! I love Texas, if I could I would move there but my husband works at the port in la. I am from Oklahoma so I miss the country so much! I want a farm and horses eventually, but I might have to settle for land and a couple of horses and a farmhouse. Which is fine too! Please show us everything and vlog, I enjoy them so much. Decorating videos too plz! God bless!
Texas! Tati no 😢
Says she loves the weather.. lol today we had tornados. I do love Texas though.  Welcome to Texas! I really enjoyed this style of video. I feel like I get to know who you are beyond the makeup.

I literally exclaimed “James!!!” when I saw those mens jeans when you guys were in target. It’s so good to see even a bit of him after the last year or so of you being gone. I’m so happy you two are doing better. You deserve it.❤️
I really like your makeup videos. However, I think this vlogging style video is refreshing. Please make more of these!

LOVE the Vlogs!!  James please let us see you! Good luck with the move and am praying to Saint Anthony that  you find your beautiful wedding ring. XOXO
I don't think you realize how spoiled you are.  You talk about needing more space?  Do you have any idea how families have to live?  Be happy you have choices.
I am so glad to see you happy 😊!
Texas Native!! You will love it!  BEST STATE EVER!!!

Too bad you didn’t pick the best state north of the red river 😩🤷🏽‍♀️ but I guess Texas is okay too! I need my space too because I’m a stubby Lioness who thrives in open spaces ha
Thanks now I want a popsicle 😜
I wish you would vlog more!!!!!

When you said Texas I screamed!! So happy for you both!! Sending you love from McAllen (Deep South Texas)!
I squeeeealed when you said TEXAS!!!  You are going to love it there. I have so many friends/family  in TX and Tennessee.  March is huge in Texas, the music festival started. You're doing exactly what my daughter and her husband did almost a year ago as they started their journey. They are in their new beautiful home now,  new job and so very happy!! Thank you for taking us along with you gurrrrrrrl!! Have fun,  take in every moment.  Loved seeing sweet Puka boy. Love and hugs to you,  James and Puka!!!! 💕💕💕🌟🌟🌟🌟
I'm manifesting you finding your wedding ring! Happy for you on your move!
I love this video so much💗Please post more content like this but also don’t quit posting your make up videos lol
Wow i would never thought you would move to Texas lol.Welcome!
Absolutely loved this Tati ❤ 👏 🙌
I love this new format, you're a natural blogger 💜💜💜💜💜
Yay! I’m in Louisiana, welcome neighbor. Hope you got through the nasty weather that just came through Texas ok, and now headed my way. I love the makeup and the vlogs. Seriously I like all you do. ❤️
Its the James content I didn't know I needed. I know he doesn't want to be in the public eye and i get it, but I miss seeing the two of you together!
Tati you could do videos of peeling potatoes and we'd happily watch!
So happy for you Tati, btw you look beautiful with no make-up, thank you for sharing lots of love from Australia 😘😘
Lost ring? I’m pretty good at finding lost things. I feel like your ring is in a safe or something that you keep money in. This would have been close to your bed. I feel like it is in a envelope. An official envelope.  Like the one your marriage license comes in. Perhaps they are in the same place. I believe you will find it. 💞I had a feeling a friend’s lost ring was in a lingerie drawer. She took everything out of the drawers. Even took all the drawers out. A few years later…. She took out a boned corset that she was going to try on under a new dress. Her ring was caught in the fabric of the corset. 💫
I'm so happy that your moving.... And I love you
This is amazing. I completely abandoned the beauty community when you left YouTube. I haven’t returned, but I love watching you now that you’re back. You radiate joy and peace! God bless and good luck with your move ❤️
I had a feeling you were moving to TX! 😍
Cheers to the next adventure!!
Wow she's moving to my state, the great state of Texas!! 🌄
OMG!! Congrats I’m so excited for you on this new part of your journey …. Getting things organized and set up is the best part of moving(excuses to buy new stuff) :) and welcome to Texas … from Houston
Love the vlog! Good luck with move!!
TATI I LIVE IN TEXAS WHAT
I’m really enjoying seeing the behind the scenes of your life it’s like we get to see another layer of you a more relatable humanized kind of level so I’m really enjoying it I would love to see more like this👍🌈❤️
So nice to hear James!
I miss seeing you and James interact in your daily life! I remember you guys doing PR unboxing and that was so much fun to watch.  I’m so happy for you guys, hope everything goes well with the moving and renovation❤️

Loved this!!!! I need more vlogs like this! Congrats on your new home 🤍🤍🤍
Welcome to Texas!! I hope you find our hospitality heartwarming.  I would never had guessed you would ever move here… lol but that’s awesome! I hope you enjoy this new chapter of your life! 💖
Welcome to Texas! I moved to San Antonio in the fall of 2000 and fell in love with the city and the state. I met my husband here and can't ever imagine living anywhere else. I wish you a safe move and good luck in your new home.
I hope all yall here are stocking up food and water because good times are not up ahead contrary to how things are looking at the moment
Your moving to dallas🤗yay
You can do this!!! Safe travels. I adore 🥰 Texas as well. Sending love ❤️ and peace ☮️
I am LOVING this Tati thanks for sharing this with us love you to death lol xoxox p.s. I have been following you for years and getting to see into your life again is super exciting and I hope you choose to keep sharing.
I love this. I move all the time so I’m always open to how to pack and organize my life!!
Hope the move is a great success for you.  I I’ve been to Texas once you will love it there, I enjoyed those type of videos I love watching you do make up but I also love watching your life you are such an inspiration to women can’t wait to see your next content
I would love more vlogs! :)
Eastern Washington is beautiful! We have tons of sunny weather here. It hardly rains here, lots of land too and big yards. Also gardening is easy here.
I like the new format. I was going through some health issues a couple of years ago and my mom taught me[even though I didn’t think it was going to work] positive minds equals positive results. I believe in that and hold trust that. So all the luck and positive thoughts prayers heading your way!!!
Welcome to Texas you are going to love it here.  We are so happy to have you.  I look forward to watching all of your new adventures in the Lone Star State.
I LOVED THIS VLOG ❤️
Yes!! Part 2 please!! I love watching you no matter what! ❤️
Welcome to Texas!!!
Congratulations Texas is awesome I wish I could move there my son lives by Austin
Omg please do more vlogs! This was so much fun to watch ❤️❤️ best of luck to you on your move!!!! Also those popsicles are so delish! I like the lime ones best lol.
Welcome to TEXAS born & raised and still hear.
Love Love Love the vlogs and other content!  Makeup is fun but other things are great as well.  A good mix would be perfect!
That townhouse is basically the same size as my home only your closet and bathroom is waaay bigger than mine. I was expecting the place to be so much smaller when you were talking about how tiny it is and referring to it as a "box." But I get wanting more space
Howdy  neighbor!! : ) From one Texas girl to another!!  Your family-wherever part of Texas you lay your hat!
How exciting!!!!! I’m moving from Washington to Texas in May and I cannot wait!!!!
I love this kind of video !
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I loved this video so much!!! I can’t wait to see more moving vlogs
i’ve lived in west texas since i graduated high school in 1999, and i absolutely hate it 😅   i’m sure you’re moving to a much more pleasant part of texas, but if you do end up hating it, 10/10 would recommend new mexico ❤️
Love this content. More lifestyle and everyday life please ❤️💜💝
I love everything you're willing to share, I enjoy watching you and your beautiful life.
I'm so happy you're moving to tx!!! We welcome you with so much love!!! ❤
I like your videos a lot, but this is definitely by far the best one. Love the reality of it. 😁
More of these please!!
So excited for your new adventure!
I really loved this video.
Congratulations Tati!  Hope Texas is awesome.
Loved this and can't wait to see the new place! Thanks for sharing with us
Welcome to Texas!!
Absolutely loved this video! ❤️ Very minor comment here, but I got excited when I saw you used the same blush I love and use! Lol 😅😄😋 Looking forward to seeing you guys happy in your new home! ❤️❤️❤️
LOVVVE THIS
Welcome to Texas, Tati!!!! You’ll love it here! Don’t know where you’ll be but it’s a great state!    Also, you do whatever content you want, we will watch it. I personally could watch you organize your closet.
This is so awesome Tati, You’re going to love Texas. Please do more videos like these!!
Texas is soooo big that it’s like going to different states depending where you are. Houston is huge, great food but hot, humid and hurricanes. Same with Galveston but at least you get a breeze.  Dallas is,,, fine. Austin is wonderful and great music and beer. East Texas, just move to New Mexico and be done with it. I see Tati in Hill Country. Bournemouth, New Braunfels, etc. lots of ranching possibilities, really building up so a good investment. You’ve got the river (and flooding) plus accessibility to Austin and San Antonio with its beautiful missions, kitschy Riverwalk, great shopping.
Kween!
Where in TX will you be moving?
Yay come to Texas!!!!!!!!
I lived in Austin for many years. Loved it. Back in LA now but would go back in a pinch. Good luck!!
❤❤❤
Welcome to TEXAS!!! I hope you love it!
I thought for sure it would be Hawaii! Way off
Packing up is no fun.
Welcome to Texas! My favorite YouTuber in the same state as me. How awesome is that?! And yes, keep doing vlogs!
Love this!
I love these kind of videos!!
I guessed it! I knew you’d move to Texas. How exciting for you 🎉
Before I pushed play, I thought, “I wonder if she’s moving to Austin!” Lol
Yes Tati we love these types of videos please do more it's like a behind the scenes and a look at the rest of your life not just makeup btw I'm so happy for you and James you look happier then you've been recently
I live in Texas and have watched you for years. 💘 your vloging! 🇨🇱 ❤
Love love love it !!! This suits you. Hopefully James will say hi to us soon.
Loved this content!! More please!!!!

Loved the blog and would definitely like to see more!!
Do NOT stick to the makeup. We love that but we know you have evolved so much that you are more than just makeup. Would love to see your new home renovation and decorating and your garden and even baking amongst the makeup. Nobody is one dimensional. 💜💜💜
Safe Travels and looking forward to you new adventure, Thank you for taking us along.
I LOVE THE VLOG!!! Keep it coming.
Loved this content! People who'd rather see makeup content can watch a different video. Super happy for you and inspired by your positive attitude to life's changes
Loved this video! Can’t wait too see more of you in Texas. So glad to be on this journey with you :)
Yes, more vlogs!
Texas I knew it! We would love to have you here!
Love the vlogs
I’d enjoy life style, decorating, renovation content.  Best wishes for the move to Texas
Welcome to Texas!! Born and raised in Houston, Tx!! I love this type of video!!
I loved this video so much.  I really hope this move is so much better for you and James also❤️. I will continue to watch your content, I don't know how I survived most of the pandemic without you 😔. I am just happy that you are back and I feel like this is going to be amazing ❤️
You are a master of makeup and I adore watching every one of your videos. But this vlog stuff?!?! I am in love. Please continue! I am so excited to be part of your moving journey and can’t wait for the next vlog. Thank you!
I’m in love with this more chill relaxed vibes 👏🏻
Tati I can relate to what you're going through with a major move since I just did the same thing last Oct.  My partner & I are older but we knew we had to leave MD & we chose the mountains of TN & at my age of 70 it's a life alternating experience because like you we don't have any family or friends here.  Just the same, I'm glad we did it & I know you will also.
❤️
Tati takes Texas!!! ❤️
love love love the vlog videos sooooo much!!
I just KNEW you were moving to Texas! I don’t know why but I just thought it would be perfect for you. I don’t live in Texas but I’ve always been in love with the idea of living there. So excited for you guys!
I’m SO SO happy and excited for you..I feel this will be the best journey yet and we’ll be with you all the way..Love You Tati😘
Puka is sooooo cute and a great supporter!! Very excited to see more of your big move Tati♥️
Thanks for sharing Tati!!! Best of luck to you and James in Texas!!!!😊
Congratulations!! Good love vibes to you🥰
Yaaaay glad to have you come to TX 🤗
LOVED this vlog!!!
I love the vlogs and seeing what’s going on with you and your personal life! I love the Puka guest appearance
Give us ALL the vlogs 😍
One of our daughters bought a house in Austin last summer and built one on 25 acres outside town. They remodeled theirs (the one on the average) and love it now! They’ve got excellent renters. We like in Oregon and they bought two houses one 2500 sq foot brand new to rent out and theirs for only 100k over what was available here that was similar to the rental. Texas has decent government for the most part and low low housing costs. Have a great time there!  I guessed, North Carolina, texas or Nebraska!
TEXAS everything is bigger here!!! I vote for Houston!!
Omg! I guessed Texas or Florida. Welcome to the South 💖
VLOG VLOG VLOG!!!!
I love it Tati! The best of luck with your new chapter ❤️
You got this!! 👍🏼✨✨🙌✨✨
You are simply glowing in this video 🤩💕 your energy is so magical

I loved this, Tati! Of course, I enjoy your makeup vids, but I really love your vlogs! I think I would enjoy watching you just unpack, or clean or just eat even...lol~ I hope you do more vlogs. You're not just a makeup guru, you're way more than that. I'm fully invested in your life journey, so share whatever you want! I would definitely watch it.
Starting from scratch is the best! Rebuild your life as you envision it. My daughter will be moving to Texas soon!

I hope you find your wedding ring in the move. Happy you guys are moving to Texas. My brother lives there and he loves it. Taylor Wynn is down there now. And Leighanne says is in Texas. Good luck on the move!
I don’t watch vlogs usually so imo if a vlog replaces a regular video no but if it’d bs an additional video.. sure!
Would love to see more vlogs throughout your journey! Hope the move goes well❤
Aww a little kinda James cameo!! Yay! I think you are going to LOVE Texas. I can’t wait to see you build your new life there. 💜🦋

Congratulations 🍾 lots of happiness and love in your new place. We love your makeup videos and you can vlog all the time too.
Loved this! Also, I felt the need for popsicles when stressed 😜
I so thought it was going to be Hawaii. Don’t worry everything is just a plane ride away.
Just moved to texas from illinois and my only regret is not moving sooner. It was truly the greatest decision I have made. Welcome y’all 🤠
Oh coffeebreakwithdani is in Dallas...maybe a collab?
Love this kind of format

Everyone’s moving here 😩😔traffick already sucked before… sucks for us
I had a feeling it’s be Tennessee or Texas!   Me: wow what a big dreamy closet! Tati: it’s not very big  🤣 it’s totally relative. I had a walk-in closet once in an apartment. And long to have one again some day!
Ahhh I’m from texas!! I’ve been in NC for 5 years now, but I definitely miss it
Love the vlog, now we will know you better.
Tati, this was so fun!  Thank you for sharing some behind the scenes will us!  I thoroughly enjoyed it and can't wait to see how you move has gone. Fingers crossed it went well and hoping the renovations to you new home go smoothly so you can get settled in.  Much love to you!  PS - Hi James!!! 😁❤
Your brave for moving to tornado territory. Those are the things of nightmares. Be careful, there is supposed to be some pretty gnarly weather there now. Texas is not all sunshine.
Soooo excited for your new adventure! Please do more of these vlogs!!!
This was so much fun to watch. Thanks for sharing with us! And welcome to Texas! You’ll love it here. ❤️
I’m so excited for you and your new life journey.!❤️
I prefer vlogs!!!
Good luck, you've got this!
Welcome to Texas! ❤️ My husband and I also moved here kind of on a whim 6 years ago and never looked back. We are in the Dallas area and absolutely love it here!
Oh I'm SO excited for this new format! Please create more content this ! BTW- outshine popsicles are so good! You look so happy, you deserve this so much! Thank you for taking us with you!
So happy for you!! Texas is the place to be! HEB is the best grocery store here. Can’t wait to see more! 💖💖
I guessed Texas! More vlogs please

This was really fun! What an exciting time in your lives! You guys are going to LOVE Texas! God bless you, James and your Puhka!
🇨🇦so glad for you an yes love the makeup but also the new journey yes girl bring it on an good luck 🤞🏻 in the move can’t wait to see what you both have planed ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
Texas will be a new clean slate with friendly genuine people. I wish you and James the best. Just remember our humidity is a bit different than LA. We can also have all 4 seasons in a day but you will love your freedom and peace and quiet.
Congratulations on your move
Join the roller derby while you’re in Texas!  Brush on some throw down in your giddy up!
You will LOVE Texas!
Yay! Welcome to Texas!  Love the vlog-style vid - yes, do more. This was fun!  Lots of sunshine in your future.  "The stars at night, shine big and bright...deep in the heart of Texas!"
So happy for you both to start this new chapter and to watch it unfold.  I’ve watched you for years and to see your countenance and the way the lord has worked in your life is amazing.  May god continue to bless you throughout this new adventure and wherever the tumbleweeds take you.  🙏🏼❤️. PS… love to see your vlogs 💖
I LOVE WATCHING THIS ! You even gave the girlies who want makeup, a Timelapse that can I say was BEAUTIFUL! Congrats on the big move ! Can’t wait to see the new background and space ! Also even tho it was small, glad to see James somewhat back on the channel !
What a wonderful journey you are having. Everyone loves TX. I was hoping you were moving there. My BFF has been there for 40 years, and she absolutely loves it!  So many people I know have moved there and never looked back!   YeeeHaw y"alls
I hope this new space is an incredible new beginning for you all. Thank you for sharing...🥰💜
Good luck Tati!
Welcome to Texas, don't vote for Demonrats, thanks.
You’re so glamorous and sparkly, Tati.  You’ll be right at home in Texas.  Congratulations!  Enjoy the adventure!  😁
Congrats! We live in Illinois & I would love to move but we don't want to move from family so maybe when we're old & our kids are grown 🤣
Tati I’m so excited to follow along while you share this journey with us. I’ve watched you for a long time, I was ecstatic to see you back and I’m overjoyed to see life is throwing blessings and sunshine at you. 😊❤️
I was thinking you guys would move to either Texas, Florida, or Hawaii. Idk why just was thinking one of those three. Honestly I would probably move to one of those three if I had the choice. lol
I can’t wait to see more vlogs
Share as much as you like!  I can’t wait to watch your new chapter!
YOUR TEXAS FANS ARE SO EXCITED!!! WELCOME!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️

Congrats on your move Tati!!!! So happy for you guys! I loved the vlog!!! I just moved to Dallas from San Diego it’s a big change but wow it’s so much more affordable here!!!! Have a safe trip! The only thing I’ve had big trouble adjusting to is the mosquitoes in the summertime lol.. Can’t wait to hear how you’re settling in here!!! Hugs and kisses 😘
5 minutes in and this is SO cool! I love this SO much!!!!!!!  Ps. Did I mention how much I love Puka! 🥰
The universe bless you! ❤
Welcome to Texas! It’s the best! 😍
The mr. bill dog toy!!! Our dogs love it! I never comment but had to when I saw it. Love you and you will have a great time in Texas! So happy for you.
You’ll love Texas. And hey, the last two years when we couldn’t see friends, you were totally someone who kept is company. It’s not weird at all!
You’re a natural at vlogging! You should absolutely do more of it!
I love this! So happy for you!
Love this👏
We'll be seeing you on the real housewives of Dallas next! Lol. You'd be great on that show lol
I love the vlog style! It’s so much more personal 💗💗
Should we start vlogging more?
Welcome home to Texas, Tati! We’re so happy to have you! ☺️❤️🐎
About the weather in TX ... well, we just had a tornado threat that's finally passed. But my cat and I spent some time in the bathroom on the first floor - they recommend a small space on the interior part of your home like a bathroom or closet. Also the summers are a great test for makeup - can be over 100 degrees. To the other extreme, in north TX (Dallas area) we can get slammed by ice and/or snow storms. Usually doesn't hang around for many days, but people here really don't drive well in this kind of weather. I do wish her much happiness in her new digs. Happy trails.
I wish I could be so lucky to run into tati at target or Home Depot! 💜
Wishing you the best in your next step of live...xo's form Egypt to You & Your Lovely Family
YES. More vlogs!!!!🙌🙌
Tati I'm so proud of you. I can't wait to see you and your love finally happy. And I'm praying for you as your on this journey and on the journey of loving Jesus
WELCOME TO TEXAS YALL👑🙏♥️🥰💋
Hey Tati this was fun
So excited to watch this new journey!
I love this format. I would love to see more of this content. Hope You love Texas
Love this style of video Tati.. After the pandemic that we have all gone through I enjoy the seeing the real you... Popsicle are good for the soul...
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
LOVE THE VLOGS!! GO FOR IT TATIIIII! we love makeup and vlogs <3
Love this. More of this content.
I moved to tx from the east coast and Texas is such an amazing place to move to because people are so friendly and it’s so easy to get around . I hope that you will love it
OMG! Welcome! My husband and I moved here mid last year in a temporary situation while we build our home.🥰We love it and we have actual acreage.😳It’s amazing. We are building still though so ours is a long, big project. We hope to be able to move in this year lol. I’m so excited for you. BEST STATE EVER. 😉We came here from NV fyi.😣We have some family here though so that’s been nice.
Even though our own cross-country move was very close to 10 yrs ago, I feel your pain. Moving is NO fun but the end result is going to be fabulous. There's something so refreshing about moving somewhere you know no one. Just the two of you against the world can really cement your bond. May God travel with you. I pray this is the best thing to ever happen for you.
Love the blogging!
Texas Tati Vlogs!! I’m here for it! 🙌🏼♥️🙌🏼♥️🙌🏼♥️
I miss James!
I knew you were going to Texas! Love the vlog and seeing your process.

I'm so happy for you guys!! Can't wait to watch this next chapter xoxo
I wish you a lot of good luck with your new home❤️
I enjoyed your Vlog ...more please. I'm happy for the new start in your life's journey. I call myself a Texafornian. A California by way of Texas. I will be interested to know your future thoughts of the Texas heat. You're going to one extreme to another in terms of weather.
You look so genuinely happy while waiting for James to bring your coffee. So happy to see it! Congrats on the new adventure
Texas welcomes you with opened arms!!!! Now go get yourself some cowboy boots and a hat! I love moving vlogs!!!
You are a gem in the make up industry! Good luck with the fresh start:)

You’ll love Texas !!! is it by the coast?
I love this format. Please note videos like this!
Love the vlog!!!  Keep it up 👍🏻. Welcome to Texas. I think you will love it. Hope you are somewhere near me. I’m at the beach 🏖. Congratulations on your new adventure. Love the video! 💜💜💜K
You will love Texas! We have relatives there and that's one of the places I would move to if we were to leave the frozen tundra
Congrats on moving to Texas! (The best state!) I’m a native Houstonian and my family has been here since shortly after the Texas-Mexican War. I can’t imagine ever lining anywhere else! I hope you love it as much as I do and have an amazing fresh-start. If you need any advice, hit me up!
No body cares really
YAAAAAASSSSSS!!!! I KNEW IT!!!! I had a feeling it was either Texas or Tennessee. I LOVE Texas! I will live here until I die (not originally from here).  We welcome you!!!!!
Good luck with your move xx
Yes PART 2! Love this content as well 🖤
I am totally loving this seeing your life and your being you more
Just one question: In what world is that not a large closet? Ok maybe there are bigger closets but not in my life! Enjoy your new adventure. You deserve only the best! Congratulations!!
MORE VLOGS. ANYTHING YOU DO WE LOVE!!!! Amazing!!!!!
I freaking loveeeee thissss
This is so exciting!! Welcome to Texas!!!! 🥰🥰🥰
I surely thought you’d be moving to some mountain state, I was leaning towards Colorado. But TEXAS!  Welcome to Texas!  So excited and happy for y’all!  😉🤠👢
Yesssss!!! Do not stick to just makeup. We need vlogs, fashion, lifestyle…. Everything!
I’m making a big move too, almost across the country, mid country lol  Please do a video of what to consider? Must know? Expectations of moving and costs? I’ve never made a big move before and am super nervous and have NO idea where to start 😬
Blessings for your new move, home,and adventure! I love any type of video you chose to share.  Praying Blessings abundance upon your life and home.
This video is EVERYTHING! I love seeing Tati get domestic at Home Depot! 🤣  And omg welcome to Texas,Tati!!! I share the same dream as you, except without the full glam and with farm animals. I grew up in Texas, moved away for 20 years, and I'm back for the end game. 🤠
I think lifestyle Vlogs would be great from you. Take a break from makeup
Tati, congratulations!!! As a person who moves every 1-3 years for my husbands job, I know the stress of moving all too well ❤️ give yourself all the grace and soak in every moment :) you’ve got this!!
I loved watching this vlog style video from you. Sending prayers to you and James. ❤️
Ahhh my face hurts from smiling for the entire vlog. I am so so so happy for you and the new change coming up. Can’t wait to see all the vlogs and home remodeling videos coming up.please keep them coming our way.
Guurl..I recently moved 2 weeks ago, and YES...SUPER stressful and I don't have anywhere NEAR the amount of stuff you do. I can't even imagine what a project that was for you! Can't wait to see the new place!
So excited for you. I think this vlog is great. Keep it going. Cannot wait to see the new studio. Good luck!!!!
LOVE the vlogs. Keep it up.
Love the format I love vlogs!!!!
Welcome to Texas! It's my home state. You're gonna love it! ❤️
Pretty exciting!  I wish I could move out of Los Angeles up north somewhere.  Good luck!
I enjoy your vlog type videos.  I would love to see more of your behind the scenes life instead of just makeup. I think you would transition well over to a vlog channel yet still do your makeup stuff also.
How exciting. I'm from NW Houston area. Cypress TX. You should LOVE TEXAS! So happy for y'all.
I enjoy anything you share. I love your energy.  Travel safely
Honestly I’m out of my season of being makeup obsessed, so I love the vlogs regarding everyday stuff!
I loved seeing all of this. Its so relatable! I just did this (I am 53 and never lived where I have no friends or fam.) at the end of 2019 (then the 'Rona happened.) We moved for my hubbs job. I knew no one! It has been an adventure!
We love the VLOG !!!! 👏🏼👏🏼
EXCITING! ❤ I hope you'll love it there! I was born & raised in SE TX but moved decades ago. There are things I miss and some I definitely do not. The food is the best and most diverse in the world in my opinion. Texas is a huge State so your social and geological climate will depend on what part you're in. It will be a culture shock since you're used to the west coast.  I LOVE the vlog! Thank you for sharing!❤❤❤ Also, is your hair lighter, or is it just the lighting? Either way, you are gorgeous as always, even under the stress of moving. So very excited for you. You both deserve all the good things.
I knew it! Texas is where everyone Is moving to
Can't wait to see the renovations! Love those kind of videos! 🎉💜
Yay! I started my garden this year too! How exciting for you. Congratulations on the move.
I could sit for hours watching you put on your makeup. It's so soothing 😍
🎉❤️😘💋xo
Super excited for you!!! I love the vlog. You will be great whatever you do! I love Texas. I could see you in Dallas or the outskirts of Dallas. I have family throughout the state. Prayers you find your missing wedding ring. I doubt you read this but if you do, pray for wisdom where your ring might be. You have become my new favorite- your new chapter in life and beliefs are looking good on you. Blessings !
Welcome to Texas be safe God bless u all
Welcome to Texas!!!!
No love this format also, not just makeup. Congratulations on your move, good luck
The thumbs up button did something cool 🥳 also congratulations on moving 🥰🙌🙌🙌
Love this conttent!! Yaaassss!!!
I love this video!
Your face is glowing! You can tell how happy you are!! 🥰 and I’m sooo happy for you!! Spring is the perfect timing for rebirth, new beginnings and de cluttering! I feel like TX is a great state for you!! Wishing you all love and positivity!! It’s a new chapter in your life and thank you for sharing your life with us ✨✨also I love the vlog style clips!! It’s nice seeing you in a different light!! Xoxo
I am so happy for you!! ❤️‍🩹 welcome to Texas!
I knew it!   Austin is the CA!   Bet y’all are on the outskirts.   Enjoy, good roots to makes dreams come true.
Yes please vlog! Love this Tati! So excited to see all your new content!
You're moving... TO Texas... interesting...
I would love to see more lifestyle and vlog content! Love to watch these types of videos when I workout.
Hope y'all didn't get caught up in the weather today. 🤠 Texas weather is a trip.
Yassssss.... You're coming close to me..... I'm in Oklahoma and plan to get a work transfer to Texas in the future to be closer to my daughter and sister. And my coworkers/counterparts all live in Texas. It's a sign. It's meant to be! My fav YouTuber in TX!
I love this vlog! You seem busy...but very happy. It's good to see you smiling and having fun!
Congrats James &Tati!  Would love to see you do lots of flogs!🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️
Well, I didn't guess Texas but, I guess it should have been the first guess. So many people out west is moving to Texas. People not in the same tax bracket as most of us. I think it's great as long as people don't bring their California politics and beliefs with them and try to change Texas to fit them instead of them changing to fit Texas.
Congrats!! Wish yall the best in Texas 😘
Best with all to come, Texas!!!
best day ever for us was moving out of CA!  enjoy the journey
Welcome to Texas
So excited for you!  You are going to love Texas.
For all new house updates, I'm into the series name: Studio VII !! Much love to you and the boys!
Our girl tati is back and I am seriously loving it. Please don't ever stop being you. I wish you nothing but success and happiness. Gosh I feel like I'm your bestie and you have no idea who I am.
Love this content ...yes, more please!!!!!!!!
The way I screamed when you said Texas!!😁
You have a new found strength and  light that is unbelievable. Blessings
My mum had me at 39 and my youngest brother at 43. I feel like this is the beginning of the best chapter of Tati and James (miss him so much!) I have good feelings about Tati and James becoming parents in Texas. Noone deserves a baby more. You guys will be amazing parents. Everyone is putting it out to the universe for you 🦋🙏🦋
Welcome to Texas!
Thank you for saying we don't get nice weather in Washington so people won't move here. LOL More green for me to enjoy on my over half an acre which was more than affordable. You just need to finds the gems and they are here.  I thought I was a city girl but now that I'm in Kitsap county I absolutely love it and not far from either the Bremerton or Port Orchard ferry if I need to go to Seattle. I had to pack up the rest of my mom's house when she moved to England. Then she moved back. After moving 3 places in 3 years never again. I found my sanctuary.  Loved the deer coming in my yard yesterday and today aka my free gardeners.
I lived in Texas a long time ago and Loved it!! I wish u the best of luck!!
can’t wait for more vlogs!! you’ll have to meet up with Sazan Hendrix (a fellow Christian and YouTuber) when you’re settled in!
trending...  why...  how...  I dont get people...
Yeehaw!
❤️ ❤️
I'm so proud of you Tati!! You may have hit a rut but you've climbed your way out with grace and love!! I've started over more times than I like to admit but this last time I was mindful with myself and my thoughts, worked hard and made it out. I'm so excited to see where you go next. You are and have always been an inspiration to women and I thank you for that!!
More content like this please
Howdy! Welcome to the Lone Star state 🤠. I’ll be on the lookout for you in Ulta and Sephora 😍.

Ohhhhhh yessss welcome to the great state of Texas!!
Blessings for sure. I am looking forward to seeing your renovations.
I bet my husband y’all were heading to Texas!  Welcome! And if you end up in the Austin area Welcome again!
Do not stick to the make up alone take your time don’t waste your time and get it done you’ll be OK I am cheering for you.💄💎⭐️🤩👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽😍🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🔑🏠
Yay! Moving from Washington to Texas too. We’ll be in Hill Country, and love the Southern Hospitality there.
I'm living for Tati vlogs! Your personality is so gorgeous. You've always made me laugh and feel good. I get on YouTube and always save you for last. It just makes me feel good to finish off with a Tati video. Good luck with everything. I'm so sorry you didn't find your exquisite wedding ring. Your ring finger looks like it's missing it. I miss seeing it. Please do MORE VLOGS! Love you girl ❤️
Love this style of video from you! ❤️ Good luck with the move babe 🙏🏻
Good Luck with Moving x
Love this! Show me everything Tati 🥂💚
I've been watching for a very long time! I just want you to know that I couldn't be happier for you. I've watched through it all. The ups and downs and everything in-between and there is one thing that can be said for it all. You deserve happiness. You are a kind and genuine soul. I know you probably won't see this but I really and truly wish the best for you. Peace and love and happiness. You are a true genuine soul and through the darkest of days I'm here to tell you that because of you're true nature the sun will shine for you!!!!
Love watching you do some vlogging 😁 it's great x
Welcome to Texas! I am pretty sure I know what town you are moving to and you will LOVE it.  Many celebrities live there and enjoy their privacy, but also love what the city has to offer.  Good luck to James and your fresh start!
I'm 2 minutes in and so super excited!! I've wanted you to vlog behind the scenes for YEAR'S!
Yayyy, Texas! Texas girl here!!!

I love this type of vlog style, I’m interested in any type of lifestyle content you are willing to post. Good luck, praying you and James love your new home in Texas. 🤗
Do a little bit of everything! I enjoy seeing little bits of people’s lives (the good and the bad).
That closet is huge to me 😂 can't imagine needing more space
I hope you see this video on the trending page today and realize how much your fans ADORE you!! We love the makeup AND vlogging content - mostly we just love you!  I'm sharing so much positive energy with you as you move onward and upward! Can't wait to see what happens next. 💜💜🦋

Behind the scenes tati❤️❤️❤️ love it

So, James will regain his Southern accent in a Southwest way!  Best wishes!
You will love Texas. I have been born and raised for 50 years here. You will despise Texas summer, but you will really like it.
JUMPIN JEHOSHAPHAT CONGRATS!  I hope the new start gives you guys everything you could ever need and more!
Yay you won’t know how to act living in a free state. 🤩
Yessss 💯 support Tati Vlogs!! So happy for you, can’t wait for you to share the new beginnings. lol 7-11
*MOVING SUCKS. It might be the absolute worst thing on Earth that isn't trauma or  involuntary. (Usually)*
Girl, you'll be in the Bible belt. Just wear your fancy shoes to church!
I was just eating the same popsicle!
Yes!!! Welcome to Texas! ❤
I love the new vlog! I've always wanted to go to Texas. I'm excited for your new chapter
I was wrong.  I would’ve bet that you were moving to Hawaii.  Hope you like your new location.
I looooove lifestyle too! Give us all the vlogs!
The hubs and I moved from WA to Texas in 2020 because he’s military. Speaking of weather, we just had to take shelter because tornado, it’s 30 degrees one day and 80 degrees the next. So…yea Texas is definitely very different
Looking forward to this adventure with you guys…..congratulations & thanks for letting us come along 😎
Well obviously I love Tati makeup videos, but I loved this vlog too. You should do both! Congratulations on moving. I’ve never been to Texas but It seems like a great place to live. Can’t wait to see the new house! ♥️
Loved this vlog! Congrats on your move and best wishes for you and James! ❤️
I am so happy for y’all! I just moved my family to Texas last year! If you’re here already, I hope you didn’t get caught in this storm we’re having in DFW area right now, and the fires south of Fort Worth! Be safe guys!!   Also, don’t stick to the makeup! We love seeing you outside of the sit downs!
Good luck on your new adventure. ❤️
I'm from Southern California originally but Ive lived in Indiana for 11 years and now I'm moving to Texas in August or September .
Welcome to the south!!! I love any and all videos you make! Give me all the videos!😍 Missed you and James so much! Can’t wait for more!❤️
Whoo Hoo! Texas is a darn big state so I wonder where you will end up. DFW girl here and let me tell you, the whole state is excited to have you call it home 🤠
Oh my God! Tati I’m so excited! You will love Texas! ❤️❤️❤️
I like this reality, more of this. We love your personality, letting us in just a little just makes us feel more connected (in a not creepy way) 💜 as long as it makes you feel comfortable please do more personal stuff!
I will totally watch vlogs and any lifestyle videos. For me those are more relatable as I don’t use makeup as much. Love all you do do
Loved it!
that's a side of you that I super love … hope everything goes well ❤️❤️❤️
Texas needs Tati!! 💜
Girrrl yes you’ll love Texas!!! Born and raised Austin, Texas ❤️ safe travels
Yay!! Texas is ready for you girl! 🤠🤠
As a native Texan I can't help but wince a little when I hear that (yet another) Californian is moving here.  I didn't catch where you're resettling to, but since most of y'all are going to Austin, I'm guessing you are, too.  In any case, good luck.
I actually really enjoyed this and appreciate you telling us where you are moving from and where you are moving to because both of those areas came up last night when I did a Google search for myself because I am looking to move as well and don't have a clue where to go as I am a middle-aged white woman totally alone and have no one unfortunately so talk about Stress and Anxiety I also have to sell my home before I move and was literally crying to my brother about I just don't know how I'm going to pull this off things get harder as you get older especially if you were alone and you wind up with health issues as most do I'm just reading everything and I can't even start the process to begin because I don't know where I want to move ugh much love and good luck together in ur new home #Tati (wish me luck too gurl its gonna be even harder for me)
Puka reminds me of my boyfriends' parents' dog when they were moving omg she woke up and the couch was gone and she was like "wtf... where's my spot"
Ahhhhh!!! I’m in Texas😍
Welcome to TEXAS TATI!!! I hope you like Texas as much as we do .♥️
This was so enjoyable to watch. I think we all love you, James and pooka. Can’t wait to see more!
whats your Starbucks go to order
This was so fun Tati!!! Also so awesome to slightly see but hear James beside u!! We miss that guy but totally understand y he doesn't wanna be on camera anymore. Just love seeing yall 2gether. 💕  So excited for yall bet Texas is gonna be amazing. Wish u guys were moving to North Carolina but I knew u weren't bc I think u said James has family here a long time ago.
I absolutely loved this kind of video! ♥️
Hope you two are safe. ❤️🙏🏻Welcome to Tornado season in Texas 🤦🏻‍♀️
I love this for you!!!
I love the vlog!
Tati I loves this format so excited for your new adventure cowgirl 🤠
You should’ve come to Spokane.. way more country and way cheaper than Seattle with way more Sunshine. Seems like everyone moving to Texas hates it after 6 months
We
Congratulations on the move!!! Yes please keep doing more vlogs. Can’t wait to see your new space. 💖
I love this journey for you!!! So happy for you!!!
I knew it! I been watching your videos for years. Welcome  Ya’ll to my beloved Texas!!
I loved this type of video! It felt a lot more personal and warm. Kinda like I was actually there with you. Also, congrats on the move!! ❤️
I LOVE THIS VIDEO
Welcome to Texas! ♥️
I live north of Dallas, and it is so beautiful, spacious and open! There are so many wonderful churches here and I hope you find deep and meaningful community among believers here.
I ave to admit, I’m watching and looking and thinking, erm, surely she’s going to do some packing now 😂, I’m terrible at leaving it to last minute, and last time we did it was definitely the last, but I’ve usually got most cupboards and drawers boxed up by that point. Plus any breakables. It’s the unpacking I can’t stand, it takes ages to sort the right storage for each house and so many boxes just sit for ages waiting for somewhere to put them. The new house sounds amazing and definitely would like to see more, especially outside if you don’t have close neighbours. Being in the U.K., you rarely get the outside space you do with some houses in USA and room sizes are always bigger.
The middle of nowhere! Tati: Texas 😂
Tati Vlog? YES PLEASE! 🖤
Yayyyyy!!!! Welcome to Texas!!!!!
I hope travels were safe and I can’t wait to see all your great ideas for your new start! I love interior design, tell us something you love that’s in your home - I bet it starts a new trend 😎
Best wishes in your new home!! I hope your wedding ring turns up!!!! Look forward to your next video!!!
I love the vlogs Tati! Please do more!!!
Love this kind of video!
100% love this! Moving is the most stressful thing. Hope you’re recovering and can’t wait to see what the sun in Texas does for you! ❤️
I live in SETX and am an interior decorator and do interior residential sales so if you need any help I would love to be there for you!
I'm enjoying the vlogs, its a nice change. I totally was guessing beach house in North Carolina. Looking forward to moving vlog 2.
Welcome to Texas ❤️
Very proud of you guys. And you did it. Sending love ❤️❤️❤️
Yes!!! More vlogs please!!! Take us with you to Texas. Congrats🥰🥰🥰
I’m in Texas! Let’s be friends!
Why is everyone moving to Texas omg, everyone move back
I missed james’ voice! We love him! So excited for you and am happy to see you so happy 💕
Texas makes a lot of sense for Tati, cheers to new beginnings! 🙌🏾
My son is moving to Texas because of the food and a new job
Yes this is much more needed! I missed you but I'm burnt out with makeup (from anyone, not just you) and I love to hear about how your life is going. These videos are fun!
No way! I’m so jealous! She has a Steinway & Sons piano just sitting there!?!?

I knew it!!!! Welcome! I lived in Washington state as well and I remember all the gloomy days .
Congratulations Tati, I was hoping you would come back to North Carolina, specifically the Outer Banks 😉 but Texas is awesome, have fun with this brandy new start, it’s going to great following along and seeing how your channel grows and expands with all the new adventures 👍🏻
More vlogs! Loved this. Best of luck on your move. I hope you and James will be real happy in TX.
Good luck with the move! It was so nice to see Puka again!
welcome to Texas!
Who cares!
Moving to the south will be good for your soul!
Do it all Tati!! Absolutely love that you are opening up & being playful.
I knew it! My gut said Texas!! Welcome, Tati! I’m pretty sure I’ve never commented on a video of yours until now! I’m super excited for you.
Love this...fun!!!
We love this
Love the vlog! Seattle KNOWS when you want to move….because suddenly it gets nice out. The PNW will miss you, but congrats on the exciting move. 📦 🚛
i’m really glad that you’re experimenting with not only make up but other types of lifestyle videos but I always love when my favorite creators do all different types of Contant  ❤️❤️
Ahhhhh holy shit yay We get you, I mean TX but yay me.
Please do a part 2! I loved this! I want to move to Texas too, maybe someday. You will have to let us know how you like it once you've been there awhile. Good luck to you, James, and your adorable pup!
Howdy, welcome to Texas. ⭐️ More vlogs please! ❤️
WOOOOHOOOO UR MOVING TO TEXAS!!!!! You’re invited to the bbq Tati!!! 😂🤣🏡❤️
Loved this video! Definitely keep doing these type of videos! So excited to see what’s to come!
Ahhhhhhhhhhh can’t wait welcome to Texas
I watch your channel for the Non makeup content. The bits and bobs we’ve had have been good but this entire video was 🔥.  I want to see as much of this move/Reno that you’re willing to share. I love that type of content, especially when it’s not from creators known for it because I somehow trust it and enjoy it more. Ha. Good luck with moving, isn’t it the worst? Uuuuuughhhhhhh.
I am excited for you guys! Please blog everything!!!
So happy for you. Praying for your move to refresh your heart and spirit. ❤️
So excited for the both of you! 💕
Please keep doing the vlogs, I love
Yes for vlogs Also - please bring back the videos you were going to Target and Walmart and buying free makeup with coupons and looking for deals etc… it was so fun to watch
Welcome to Texas!
Tati, loving the variety of your content and THANK YOU for not showing that spider ❤️🇨🇦😘
That was so beautiful Tati. I love seeing the real side of you than the more “LA” side. Thanks for sharing your amazing journey with us Love from a fellow creator <3
True beauty guru here, taking a break in her moving vlog to do a tutorial.
I love to hear that you’re moving to Texas! I know you don’t need it, but if you ever need a friend in Dallas, please reach out!!
This is so awesome 🤩 I am so happy for you. Keep crushing! 🥰
Good luck in your new journey! You deserve the best!
Please make some videos on what meals you make! That chicken meal looked AMAZING. I honestly thought you ordered food from a restaurant…like that seriously looked SO DELICIOUS. Please please make other vlog videos about fashion, food, skin care, home cooking, how you decorate your new home!! Honestly anything!! I love your aesthetic so much. I love love your new idea with videos!❤️❤️❤️ God bless you and James on your new and happy adventure to Texas!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Congrats!!!! So happy for you!
Welcome to Texas!!!!  ❤️
Can’t wait until you do more vlogs, you’re so good at it. Hope the move went well. Look forward to seeing the new house. A new beginning! 🥰 We’re all here to support you. 💗
"Freak of the week" is sending me
Welcome to Texas!! I had a feeling you'd come here ❤️
Yes show us everything.
Love these vlogs! Would be nice to see more! Sending lots of hugs from SATX ❤️❤️
SOOO excited for this moving series! Please include home organizing and decorating at the new place😍. Prayers and blessings on your new journey!
Before you even said Texas, I guessed it. For some reason Texas just seems like a good fit for you. I live in Missouri and love this state, but I used to live in Texas with my dad and if I were going to move anywhere, it would probably be there. So excited for you guys.
A complete vlog and a makeup tut, this Monday turned out epic🥰🥰🥰
Love it all, Tati!
Tati! This has to be one of my favorite videos you’ve ever made. Please keeping vlogging!
OMG FELLOW TEXAN HERE!  I was like PLEASE BE TEXAS PLEASE BE TEXAS!  You’ll love it here! 💚  Do more of these videos!
more vlogs please Tati!
Welcome to Texas!!!! You’re going to love it
Tati you look great super natural girl
Best wishes for you new journey! ❤️
God is so good all of the time.  You will love Texas.
Oh, WOW! Congrats on the new journey! We love any content from you!
I knew you were either going to move to Texas or Tennessee. Congrats on your new home!!
Good Luck in your new chapter, Many Blessings to ya'll 🙏 ❤
Love when you vlog along with the makeup and reviews of course. I knew you were moving to Texas. Well at first I thought Nashville but then you mentioned wanting sun, so I thought “Texas.” That’s where everyone seems to be going. So excited to watch this new chapter, and please clog everything, or what you’re comfortable with: renovations, exploring the city, decor, etc. ❤️❤️❤️
Oh I loved this format. You are more than just make up.
Congratulations to you both! Here's to new adventures ✨️!!
We are leaving California asap! Texas is a possibility, but we are more looking to Montana or Idaho. Montana is first on my list. Enjoy this adventure, Tati!! I’m so happy for you guys. I really enjoyed this video, and I think you are great at vlogging. God Bless you guys. 🙏🏻✝️❤️💜
omg if you come to Austin it's amazing!
Oh I need some of those clear organizers for my makeup drawers, I really need to organize my makeup drawers better! I have one of the Impressions Vanity Slaystation Vanities and I also bought 4 extra sets of the drawers that go under the vanity table to organize my makeup in and so that I could make a counter space with them all lined up. I just need to figure out the most optimal way to organize it all so that everything fits into my drawers and some things look neat and cute on my vanity and counter space. Especially foundation organization because I have 4 drawers full of foundation but they’re all standing up and it’s just hard to see what’s what and one drawer isn’t completely full so when I open and close the drawer the foundations fall over and it’s so annoying! Definitely need to get those clear organizers! I love organizing things so I can’t wait to get some new organizers! 💖
Love the vlog. Hope to see more!
Texans are very friendly and welcoming!
I enjoyed this a lot❣️  Best wishes on your next phase.🙏🏻💖
I would love to watch lifestyle content!!!
Really love this video, the real life behind all those glam makeup. Waiting for more video like this.  ❤️❤️❤️
Oh honey, you wanted sunshine, well you're getting it in Texas! Welcome to Texas babe. Love you!
Good choice,  I’m a Texan.  Love love it here .  We live in East Texas out in the county.
Love love love this type of video from you Tati!! Can’t wait to see more vlogs from you and your new journey! Also, Puka helping you pack up your make up 🥺 ❤️
I'm just going to say it and I don't care if anyone comes at me for saying it but considering when Tati came back from her long break she made a big deal about how she was minimizing and being less excessive it's a bit annoying to hear her constantly complain about how small her filming space is. She has her OWN home with a completely SEPARATE filming space and we're complaining about missing the department store filming space we had before. Some of us are still filming in our bedrooms and WISH we had a separate space that was too small to film in. There I said it lol
Omg I love this Tati! Please continue to vlog.
I am totally here for the vlogs. Keep them coming
YAY!!  YOURE MOVING TO MY AMAZING STATE!!  It's humid closer to the coast (I'm in Houston) that's the ONLY negative.  Congratulations and welcome!!
Texas is lucky to have ya! Spread your wings & enjoy!
I need a car! what’s the price??
Youre a fantastic makeup artist and influencer, but your also a great vlogger, Tati. You should consider doing more. :)
I hope you're moving to preserve the American way!
I love this new vlog type video for you. Feel like hanging out w an old friend(,:
You can keep doing vlogs, I enjoy them
Thank you, Tati! Love all your videos. Please do a favourite things video. And show us more of your world. We love you! ❤️
Tati and James so happy for you both!  I almost cried.  And you are so beautiful without makeup!
Congrats!!! Yes to more vlogs!!! 👍🏼👍🏼
We were going to move to Texas to be closer to family but the housing market there is crazy - at least it is near Austin. I'm not sure about the other parts of the state. The few houses in our price range that came on the market when we were looking last summer were fixer uppers and they sold within a few days for well above asking price. And that was an hour and a half outside of Austin/Round Rock. I'm not sure how anyone can afford to live there. My uncle's father-in-law is rich (he's a musician and played in a very popular rock band in the 70's) and bought my uncle/aunt and each of my cousins a house in Austin a few years ago. I wish I had a rich family member to buy me a house. LOL! Ultimately, we decided to stay in Minnesota but are moving across the state. The house we bought is amazing - or at least it's going to be - it needs a lot of work. Our move-in date is April 26. It's over a month away but I'm already overwhelmed by everything we have to do. Moving sucks but it will be worth it in the end.
Just do it...Nike!!lol💪
So good to see you happy again.  I hope you find your ring in the moving process.  Safe travels.
Texas is awesome! Please, vote RED when in Texas, leave the leftist garbage in the BLUE states.
I don’t know what it was, but I just knew you were moving to Texas!! I threw my hands up with excitement when you said it!! 🤦🏽‍♀️🤣🤣Welcome!! (I’m in TX myself!) you will definitely love it here!!!
LOVE the vlog!! It's funny I had a feeling ut would be Texas, another of my favourite YouTuber just moved there and I thought it would be fitting for you 😊
I love, love, love to see you so happy! Just wanted to wish you the best of the best 😘
Love the more lifestyle vlog type videos ! I’m not a huge make up person but I watch you for your energy/ personality:)
Sad to see you leave WA. But so excited for your new adventures in TX and love that you’re vlogging! 💜
Loved this vlog so much!
Very best wishes.  Texas is awesome!
Loving more lifestyle stuff!
Welcome to Texas!! Where everything is bigger and better (biased of course)! Congrats on this new chapter for you both!
Wow, you moved that much. Gosh mad respect. I literally hate moving so much, I mean it sends my anxiety through the roof that I do not move Like..I refuse. I've moved 1 time in 13 yrs for much much cheaper rent. LOL But it was next door in the apt complex privately owned next to me. If it werent for the fact that I didn't need a first/last month rent and had recommendations to move in I wouldn't have been able to afford it. It's so expensive to move .O.O Anyway, glad you're happy to move though, some folk love change. Clearly bc you seem to thrive whenever you change something major in you rlife.
3 cars lol I’m a single mom of 2 in Washington and can’t afford one which with our weather it’s tough. Congratulations on alll your success send some good vibes my way as we try and get on our feet. I know you’ll crush it in in Texas!
Love, love your vlogs! More please!! 💖
Where in Texas are you moving?
I don't normally like vlogs, but I liked this. Best wishes!
Just so everyone knows, there is more to Washington than rain and Seattle. The whole east side of the state has four separate seasons. Congratulations on your move and I can’t wait to see the new place!
By far my favourite upload of yours. Thoroughly enjoyed the change from makeup/skincare.  💕
Congratulations to you and James (and Puka, of course)! I live in Texas and it is the best place on earth!
Best wishes for much happiness in your new home and new state! (Moving totally sucks, though!) Loved the vlog and seeing another side of your life!
Hi from Texas so lucky to have you!!!
Please Tati I love this vlog style you have shared. I thought I couldn't have enjoyed your content anymore then I already do. But I do! Tati you truly brighten so many peoples lives with your positive real content. Loved this style of video but still love the makeup too. Thank you for sharing and looking forward for part 2. Sending lots of positive vibes to you and James for a uneventful, peaceful move. Lots of love and prayers for safe travels (even tho I know you are already there) Still sending so many 🙏🙏🙏 and hope you, James and Puka are safe from all the storms going on right now. Ok I'm rambling because I'm nervous for you and everyone else in Texas right now. Praying all is safe. Please everyone reading this send positive vibes and prayers to everyone affected by the storms.
Awesome! My home state! Welcome!

Where in Texas?
Good luck Tati! Moving is a huge strain and you never know how much stuff you have until you move but it’ll be worth it once it’s all over. Welcome to Texas! 😊
Feels like every influencer I know is moving to either Texas or Florida now. Kinda tells you which place are  happier or safer. Anyhow great to see Tati starting a new chapter in her life. Hopefully she'll find her happiness here with her husband and future kids. Much love and all the best to her 💖💖
Well, at least you'll look glamorous when in the middle of moving. I can't say I ever did, lol 😂. I'm just happy I remember to actually get dressed or I'll be just moving in my jammies...hahaha.
Love love LOVE this format! You can do it Tati! 💖
I love seeing a variety. It’s nice to have a break from the makeup content, and see the behind the scenes.
Best of luck in your new endeavors!  Been a fan for years...can't wait to see your life in Texas!
Texas is where I got my fresh start and it was the BEST decision I’ve ever made! I’m so happy for you Tati and hope that you love it as much as I do 💕

Tati, I had a feeling in my heart you’d be moving to Texas! We moved to Texas 3 years ago from California and absolutely love it. I hope you love it just as much as we do. God bless your new chapter and this new journey! Oh and WELCOME TO TEXAS! ⭐️
Before my son was born I used to play with makeup all the time but now I have zero time 😭 I love my son dearly but do miss the times where I could just sit and play with makeup
LOVE THIS CONTENT! So very excited for you & James’s new adventures in life!! ♥️
WELCOME TO TEXAS!!  I'm born and raised in Texas,  and it's the greatest place to be!  I'm sure you'll love it just as much as I do.
Congratulations on the move to Texas. Enjoy the vlog style video.
Lived in S E TX my entire life. You will love it. Texans are friendly and kind. Can’t wait to see the new house. Unless you live on the coast, like we do, really all we have to worry about is hurricanes! Oh and I know in Seattle no one has A/C but you HAVE TO HAVE IT IN TEXAS! Summers are brutal. Please let us know where you end up. BTW I’m still so sick about your wedding ring. I cannot believe if it got in the batch you donated they would have gotten in touch with you. 💍😢
Excited for this next chapter with you!
TEXAS?!?!?!? OMFG! I’m a Texas girl and it’s amazing, so excited for your new journey
omg TX!!!!! pls WE ARE packed yall! Lol NO MORE!
Happy for you <3
Oh my gosh!!!! I thought you sprayed your pallet for a second! I LOVE my house in Georgia with my horses. But my heart has always wanted to move back to Texas. If I could cut and paste my house in Texas it would be such a dream! Oh well I am grateful for my current situation. Good Luck Tati your going to LOVE it. Wait where in Texas? North/South/East\West?
My daughter & her contractor husband are now in Texas, look up Wheeler Contracting if you want great work at reasonable prices

My daughter and her family just moved to Texas and they are loving it. They found a beautiful four bedroom home on three acres. She’s going for the rural/homestead life. She’s getting ready to plant her garden and her husband is building her a chicken coop for their hens that are on the way. Her son wants a goat and her daughter wants a donkey. LOL One thing at a time! Congratulations on your new adventure! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 YAY!
Can’t wait to come along with you to Texas
We moved from the city to the "country" back in 2018. Though not warm and sunny Texas (did live there in the late 90s/early 2000s), we love our land and home. I love having a garden, the silence, hearing the tree frogs and insects at night, actually seeing the stars, and just having that freedom and privacy I didn't get in the city. I also work from home, made my office amazing, and LOVE it so much. Haven't regretted leaving "civilization" once in 4 years. The difference is we see cows and farm from our house, lol. Not my cows though. And sometimes the roosters in the area can be a bit noisy in the morning and gotta watch for coyotes late at night but it's beautiful and freeing. Enjoy your new home (once you get in there). I look forward to seeing videos on your home and garden.
Welcome to Texas!!!
Oh my gosh!! I never expected Texas!!
Love seeing this side of you Tati. Keep doing this kind of content please xxx
Yassss Texas Queen!!!! Love Vlogs from you!
Hearing someone say they love the weather in Texas while the area of Texas that I am in is under a tornado warning and it’s sunny and raining is making me crack up.
I’m so excited for you that you’re coming to Texas. We will welcome you with open arms. Love the vlog! Definitely keep them coming 💕💕
Loved this! So excited for you guys. Congratulations and this move sounds great 😊
So excited for you Tati! I hope you find all the happiness and good luck on starting your new family, I hope everything goes well. Been subscribed for 6 years now, just go back into watching beauty YouTube again but I have consistently been watching your channel and I know how much you've wanted to start a new chapter in your life. Much love!
Welcome to Texas! Hope you love it here!
Thank You For Sharing!!!  Texas Here You Come!!! I Am Happy For You & James!! Sounds Like A Much Needed Move!! 🙃
Did she just say she liked the weather?? IN TEXAS??? Regardless, WARM WELCOMES!!! I know you’ll love it here just as much as I do 💓
Congratulations on your new adventure!
Yes part 2 I loved this do more of this I loved it.
I lived in Washington with parents, when got married moved to Portland, Oregon, went to school in Texas and  doing residency in Nebraska. We are thinking if we arent staying in Omaha, what is next…..  my issue with Houston was humidity, I felt like I was sweating non stop, had hard time with healthcare there also. Happy for Tati, new chapter, always fun )
"freak of the week" 🤣 Also Puka is soooo adorable. Also this video was great and I totally want more vlogs!
I can't relate to having "problems" like not enough room for piano, but everyone has different needs :D New beginnings are always exciting so fingers crossed for y'all!
If your still living in the state where robberies are a usual occasion, gas prices near $10 and has an insane homeless population good luck with poverty
Texas seems so fitting for the both of you!
So very happy for you and James, I miss seeing in your videos, but it’s ok, he doesn’t need to entertain us.  It is nice hearing the two of you talk to each other.  Keep God at the center of your marriage and the two of you can handle anything, may God Bless and keep the two of you.
Welcome to Texas!!! I moved here almost 4 years ago. Hopefully it’s not too much of a culture shock, Texas is like it’s own country🤣
Welcome to Texas!!! I’ve been here since 2020. Loving it so far. Love from San Antonio!
Congratulations Tati! Hope your move was stress free and easy! I don't miss moving 🤣
I'll be here for whatever. If you're comfortable opening yourself up and sharing your life with us, here for it. If you'd prefer some personal segregation, also here for it. I've been subscribed for years for you and how you shine when you're sharing what you love.
Can’t wait for more vlogs!
I’m so happy for your next journey Tati! You got this!
Ooomg I’m sooo happy you guys are moving to Texas! I currently live in NY and I have been contemplating for months moving to Texas in the near by future 🙏🏽🥺
I, too, moved from Seattle to Austin 20+ years ago. I’m so looking forward to hearing about the unrelenting heat (it’s really the humidity). Good luck!
Good luck Tati!!!
I loved this video.  I'm so excited to be sharing in your new journey. Please do a Part 2 and keep making videos like this, it feels like hanging out with a friend . Much love XOXOX
Good luck on your move, it will feel so good getting into your new place and making it your own. I live in Washington and am wondering “should I be moving somewhere better to?🤣” more sun would be fantastic! I love this format but I still need to see makeup!!! I would love to see a video of makeup you pick up on your way to Texas…..surely you will be stopping along the way to pick up new stuff?! Thanks Tati, safe travels!!!💖
I'm all about the lifestyle vlogs!!! Love to see you on this journey! Best of luck to you all! ❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Congratulations tati! I wish you a happy life in Texas! Can't wait to see the new place 🙂
You need to hang out with Taylor Wynn !! She lived in Seattle and she’s in Texas right now and maybe moving there
I love Texas. It's my home state and I kind of want to go back. ❤ LOVED seeing a small glimpse of James and hearing his voice in the car! He sounds good. Was that his hair in a ponytail? It's gotten that long? I love me a man with long hair lol.   I'm so happy for you both and this new chapter. Texas will be perfect for you. I can see how it will be a great fit. It's a good place to rebuild and start fresh. Nice people. Old southern charm ans values which i think you will appreciate especially given your new spiritual journey of walking with God. I'm so thrilled for you, really. Good luck!
Love the vlog style!!! You are more than makeup. Please share all that you are comfortable with! Welcome to Texas! I love Texas. Lots of space and all the animals!!!
When you guys get to Texas and settle in take a road trip down to Rivera and eat at The Kings inn. Tons of famous people throughout the decades have eaten there. It's  an old place, but goooood food!
Welcome to Texas!!! I moved here a few years back with only my husband, not knowing anyone here, and it’s been great! And this vlog was great! Would love to see more, and would love to see some home Reno!
Epic
I have moved 10 times by now and Yeesss it’s so stressing and I have not gotten any better ehhehe best wishes though
I love this video!!!!
I love u Tati. And i love of this video
Born an raised in Texas, its the a wonderful place to build a family and have lots of space! Wishing you the best on your new chapter ❤
I’m so happy for u ❤️❤️❤️🥰
Loved this! Please keep vlogging all of the move!
So happy for u!! Yes please do a part 2 and lots of vlogs !!
Wahooooo Welcome to Texas 🙌💖  I wonder what city!!!! I live in San Antonio Texas 💝
Your dog 🐶❤️
For some reason, this whole time I thought you were moving to Wyoming lol
Congratulations!!!! So happy you and your husband made it through your rough patch. Hoping the new home and environnement will be a success for you both. God bless you both.🙏🏾
Hi Tati. Your makeup looked great on this video. Can you share what lipstick you used? Good luck on the move.
Yesss I knew she was conservative, no way does her husband want to live in liberal town
The Mexican food alone bro…
Welcome to Texas!!!!!!  You’re going to love it here!!!!
So happy and excited for you. Sending you & James love and Happiness in your new home. Keeping you both as always in my thoughts and prayers 🙏 You both deserve a lovely place to call home 🏡 Just know you have friends and family in God all over the world holding you both in our thoughts & prayer. You are amazing and you are a warrior Tati. So God bless you lots of hugs all the way from Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿💙 P.s just wanted to add listening to the words of the song as you packed your make up away lifted me up, and its true lovely you have weathered the storm and the future is yours. God Bless x
No Ioved th behind  The scenes, can't wait to see you continue to beautiful and brighter home c
Love this kind of videos 🥰 and im super excited for you guys 🤩
Good for you and James.  John and I are moving from New Jersey to Delaware in a few months.  Excited!
I... I.... Where did you find in Texas that's a good price? Where I'm at it's super expensive! I really like the vlog though! So yes more non makeup content!
I want it all!!!
When tati's bathroom and closet are bigger than your entire apartment you sell your soul for each month XDD
Welcome to Texas, Tati ♡
Texas can’t wait to have you, Tati! Good luck and much love 💕
Loved this vlog 😘so happy for you !!!
I get the feeling Tati will be a mom in her forties, somehow. My mom had me at 42 and I'm now 45. She's almost 88-years-old and dying of kidney disease. All I can say to Tati, likely to be a new mom in the near future, is take care of your health! I wish my mom had drank more water during her lifetime because she's not likely to make it to 90. Do whatever you need to do for yourself to be there for your future child as LONG as possible. My friends and older siblings have no idea what it's like to be in this position at such an early age. It's just the way things are and I can't change that, but I want my mom around as long as possible! Good luck to you on your move and hopefully a baby soon. :)
Love this Tati,  We love seeing you no matter what you're doing.  So so happy for you and James.  Blessings❤️
I love when you vlog
Congratulations on your new home . Enjoy your journey . Be safe . Kiss your fur baby . He’s so sweet .
Keep that spirit up beautiful- a new chapter awaits ❤️
I’m here for the vlogs Tati!!!! Sooooooo happy for you and thank you for sharing this journey with us ! Hope you had safe travels
Please keep vlogging. I've always loved and do love watching you do makeup...but I like you. You're entertaining, kind, and just enjoyable to share my time with! I lived in Sanantonio, Texas when I was in the army at Ft Sam  Houston and I loved it. I am from and live in NE Indiana and hate it. The ONLY thing I hated about Texas was rattlesnakes and leaving there. We don't have any venomous snakes where I live..praise God! Get ready for some BIG juicy steaks!
Wishing you luck in Texas! We’re staying put up north (where we feel safe lol) but hope you have a good experience
I really enjoyed this format. Just super fresh and I feel closer to you! Thank you for letting us back in.
Tati vlogs I’m all for it. Would to see you in everyday life.
That’s awesome Texas   Enjoy the freedom !!!!
I love the vlogs!!! Relatable content the house.
Congrats!! So excited to hear that you're moving, it's always so exciting. I have a nephew and in Texas,  but they're moving to Idaho so I guess they're not in Texa anymore. I guess I'll go and let you finish getting packed. Happy moving day!!!
Wow, Texas. Good luck not having body autonomy.
Congratulations to you both Tati & James! Here's to new beginnings and a house full of joy laughter and love and little babies. I look forward to more vlogs, will be very cool to watch. ❤❤❤
I love the vlog style videos!!
TATI!!! I'm sooo enjoying this vlog!
I'd seriously watch anything you put out! My boyfriend and I moved from IL to OKC in October and it's been the best experience ever! Just us and our dog Ollie. I think you'll love it more than you think! And I guess I should say welcome to the south! 🤠
I will love what ever you put out for videos you are amazing. And Congratulations on the new adventure you guys are doing. ♥️♥️
Also, we looooove the vlogs. You’ve always had an interesting life and I always loved your old videos where you would take us with you in day trips, etc
Vlog vlog vlog vlog vlog!!!!! Loved seeing this and we need part 2!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Loved this so much!! Please keep vlogging. 💜💜💜
Welcome to Texas! I'm not from here either. They might not wear masks, but they are friendly & the weather is nice. 🙏 stay happy & healthy.
Tati love be moving with you.  Watching you vlogging your new life to be!  Anything you share is fun to watch!  Love you and you do you sister!  Loyal follower for life🥰🥰🥰
Yay! Congratulations! I’m so happy for you! You will love Texas! We have the best weather. I live North of Dallas in the horse capital of Texas.
That was so beautiful Tati. I love seeing the real side of you than the more “LA” side. Thanks for sharing your amazing journey with us Love from a fellow creator <3
I loved the vlog Tati.  Congratulations to you and James on your move to Texas xo
I love the vlogging Tati. I mean I love all the makeup and glitz and glam but something about this was so fun to watch!
So excited for you!!  Love this type of content. We just moved after many years in our previous home. It is such a huge job!  Praying your move is smooth and easy. Can’t wait to see where you are headed
I LOVE VLOGGING TATI! And while I know James doesn't want to be on camera I honestly loved hearing him in this video. Missed him lots but I respect his wishes
No way!!!! We are moving to Texas also in few weeks!!!!!
Love seeing behind the scenes and wish you the very best in your move to TX.
Vlog baby!!!  Love the vlog!  Congratulations Tati and James💋
I’d watch vlogs everyday over the makeup!! There is so much more to life!! Love this for you! 💜
Tati this was amazing! more vlogs please! we love the makeup vids too though lol
BUT DID YOU EAT THE 4TH POPSICLE?! What a cliffhanger. Lol Welcome to Texas!! I'm happy you're here. Absolutely love any content you make, the vlog style is wonderful. We enjoy your personality and existence, not just your beauty supply ❤️
I just had a feeling you were coming to Texas. Welcome!!! 🤠

I know James doesn’t want to really be a part of the videos anymore, but I hope he knows we miss him :)
I like it all, makeup, vlogs… I very much enjoy!!! Xo 😘
I'm so sad you're leaving Washington..
Love this video. It feels more intimate and really getting to know you. Have a great move and hope you enjoy Texas!!
I'm here for the vlogs, makeup and everything!
Welcome to Texas! Please don't California our Texas 🙏🏻
Advice from a Texan: We don’t actually say yeehaw 😂 lol but any use of the word y’all will help you!
So fun to watch!
WELCOME TO TEXAS.. I LIVE IN BURLESON, TX WE LOVE SWEET TEA,  YOU WILL NEED BUG SPRAY ANYTIME YOU GO OUTSIDE, AND EVERYTHING IS BIGGER IN TEXAS 😘
Loved the vlog. Best of luck! I would love to see an unboxing with James  of all the promo stuff you get  - I miss those a lot!
I hope you are close to Angelica Nyqvist ! Y’all should do a collaboration if so!
Yes, I need more vlogs.🥰
I feel like a lot of us aren’t as into makeup anymore since covid, I’d LOVE lifestyle content!! The south is the best!
I loved this vlog. I want see more. I vote for a part 2.
I LOVE blogging Tati!!! ❤️❤️ More please!!!
I love the outshine bars, real pieces of fruit in them . Now, I want one too 😄
Yay! So exciting! Congrats on the move! Y’all will love it! Texas is great, been several times to visit family. The people are amazing.
Yay!!  I’m in Texas!  You will love it here!!
I LOVED this video! Can’t wait for more vlogs from you. Best of luck in TX
Omg James with a ponytail 💯💯💯💯💯💯
I love this content too Tati!! I'm excited for you and all the new things coming your way!
I knew it I called Texas it sounds like a great fit for you I'll pray for your travels and new beginnings.
Can't wait to see more vlogs! Congrats on the move!
I am very proud of you Tati. This is your journey. Do what you love. You could probably sit in front of a camera with a bag over your head for 20 min and we would all be here for you. I wouldn't advise that lol. But its true. Your personality is like a ray of sunshine. Stay blessed!!!💕
Texas de land of the free!!! Love Texas!!
I'm empathising with you. We've just moved to a new town. Still unpacking but into a house that has very few cupboard or wardrobes.
SO MUCH MORE SUNSHINE IN TEXAS!!!👌👌👌
I LOVED THIS!!!! Please keep this up!!! I’m so excited for your journey!!!
So happy for you both! Love seeing your journey! Prayers and blessings for you!
KEEP TEXAS RED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
OMG! PLEASE DO NOT COME HERE AT VOTE BLUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU ARE WELCOME TO LIVE HERE- DONT CHANGE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Aaahhhh, I was hoping you’d say Texas!  I’m here in Texas, I’m in east Texas in a historical home 🥰♥️ my husband is a contractor and we are in the process of remodeling our home as well. It seems like there has been a lot of Californians and New Yorkers moving here since the pandemic started. You just get more for your money here. I’m so excited for you guys ♥️🥰🙌😁
Oh ……. Texas. I’ve vowed to never travel to texas or Florida again. Unless their views regarding women change.
I kept telling myself, “she’s moving to Texas”. And voilà! So happy for you. 👏
As a native Texan, I welcome you to the Lone Star State! Just remember when you come, there’s a number of reasons people prefer to live here so our humble ask is “Don’t California our Texas”🇨🇱 I know your coming from WA but you get the gist.
Love the video! I’m excited for more behind the scenes. I kind of miss just an old fashioned tutorial with favourites though. I love knowing what new things you love but I also just want to see how you wear what you love. Am I the only one that forgot how to do make up during the pandemic?
Love it I moved from Washington to Texas too  It's a very good decision  I wish the best for you to the new place and a new start 🤩 You deserve the best we all love you and ready to follow your journey ❤️
Best of luck to you in Texas!
I love your vlog! These are my favorite videos! Yay Tati!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love seeing this side of you. More videos like this!
Love the behind the scenes more real & raw Tati!! ❤️❤️ Can't wait to see your adventure with James and Puka, also how did I forget about Puka? Haven't seen him in so long he's such a cutie pie!
Wooohooooo! Texas is a great fit for you! Can’t wait to see the new home, see you enjoy the land and surrounding area, and of course your new vlogs… Btw, had to move several times as an adult due to my ex husband… it is scary, but you’ll find a groove! Also, you can buy a HUGE home in Texas compare to other parts of the country!!!
I like all your content! Congrats on the move!
You’re the one person I am happily welcoming to Texas!  Welcome to Texas and hello from Houston!❤️
Love the way this video was done! Looking forward to seeing the process. You’re never alone when you have us!
I love the vlog! Keep it going
Heya! I'm also moving to Texas (in a few months)
Vlogging is my favorite content!
Been here since day one and your journey has been amazing congratulations on this new chapter for Your family ❤️
I missed James! It was so great hearing him in the vlog!
As a native & forever Texan, welcome to the greatest state ever! 😆
Yay, Texas!
Heck ya I like this format. Loved hearing James’ voice even if we didn’t see him on camera.  Can we guess what city in Texas?  I guess Austin…..
TATI TAKES TEXAS!!! Yesss, i live in Texas too heyyy gurrl!!
Welcome to Texas!! Dallas local here. Please do a meet and greet!!
I hope the move went well for you all. Would love to see a part 2.
Ugghhh love you so so much! 😍 Good luck with your new beautiful home🙏🏻❤️
Yes love the vlog style!
What part of Texas?
So excited for you to move somewhere new and have a truly fresh start. Also, would love more vlogs!! ❤️
Tati, loved this. Please do what makes you happy! I started watching you because of the makeup but I’d love to see you do other things.
I live in north Texas! Welcome!!! While I find the real-estate absurd, I'm glad you're coming!
Good luck with your move Tati!! When you get settled in and things improve in the world, you should have a meetup. I live just a couple states away and would definitely travel to meet you.
Moving is insanely stressful, and moving across country ratchets up that stress tenfold!! You’ve got this! I can’t wait to see the new place!! Also, you’re gonna love TX!
So happy for you… seeing you excited and happy for a fresh start we YouTube family are equally happy for you ❤️
And NC is even closer!  Congrats on the new home! 💞💞
Love your eye makeup in this vlog
Tati... TX?  Really?  I live in TX now and I can give you some pointers good and bad.  1) Humidity.  LA and WA have NONE compared to TX.  Hopefully you aren't going to Houston.  It's the worst.  Austin is better than most.  If it drops below 90% count your blessings. 2) Storms.  When you hear the sirens go, hit the deck.  There is a tornado in your area.  Have a below ground shelter for you with light and food. 3)  Black Ice.  In the winter you will have black ice to drive on. Most places close in this case during the winter. 4) Temps.  Regular temps are in the high 90s to low 100s from May to the end of Sept.  There is no fall. 5) Real Estate .  Housing is cheap.  Where they get you is property tax.  They can raise it sometimes more than 10% a year. It's not like CA where it is a max of 2%.  There's no limit in TX. 6) Driving.  Get used to HUGE trucks that will run you off the road.  Regular speed limits are between 65 and 75 even close to downtown 7) No state income tax!!  YEY!!! 8) Sales tax is up to 9% in some areas of the state.  Some places will add a city sales tax (Dallas) 9) Austin is a college town (University of...).  Lots of burgers and beer places downtown.  Best weather in the state but still HOT 10)  San Antonio... meh 11)  Dallas... MONEY!!  This is where I am.  Good luck to you here in the Lone Star State!!!  Unfortunately our state is VERY VERY Red.. CA and WA are VERY VERY Blue.  Better get used to that pretty quickly.
I am Texas born.  I love it but you may be in shock when July and August roll around.  Great people, great food and great local culture.  Plus you are going to look great in tight jeans, cowboy boots and a hat.
OMG, y’all are gonna be Texans!!!! Welcome!
As a Texan, I LOVE it here 🖤
I love vlogs! Keep making them Tati! And congrats for the new house :D
Texas the best to you and james
Yes more vlogging I miss when you would take us along
You are going to enjoy Texas!!
This was fun. It will be fun to follow your journey.
Wow. Texas. I’m a native Texan. Welcome!
Thought it was going to be Tennessee!
Love you (and James and the 🐶)  so glad for your fresh start!!!
LA never seemed right for you (although I know you were near Seattle in this place). It's a cesspool of fakery and backstabbery, and I just hope your new home brings you actual joy and peace. ETA: I'm a Texan and I love a lot of things about Texas. There are a lot of things that make me angry and sad, but I do hope you love it there.
Texas!!!! so cool!!! Good for you!!!!
Ahhhh! Welcome to Texas Tati!!! The hot summers are killer but you weirdly get used to it otherwise I think you’ll love it here. Enjoy all the BBQ and Tex Mex!
Tati, do you think you'll ever replace your wedding band? I imagine you miss it. Have safe travels. Don't you think lashes were a little too much for moving? Lol I hope you don't mind tornadoes? Every time there is a thunder storms you get tornadoes. Please stay safe.
I care about u and am sorry for ur trials however seeing ur place and beauty room that u have been calling tiny shows ur may b out of touch with real life issues right now. I’ve been thinking u r poor on the verge of having nothing. U called ur closet small it’s larger than anything most people will ever have. I’m not angry or shaming u just try to remember that u at ur lowest is still so much better than most could dream to have at their highest.  I work very hard and still had to make the heartbreaking decision to have to put my dog to sleep cause I couldn’t afford her surgery. I hope u never have to experience that - or not leave ur apartment other than to drive to work because of gas prices.  I just hope u keep the big world view in mind. Thank u
California is about creating.  Texas is about lower taxes.
WELCOME TO TEXAS, Y'ALL!!!!  So HAPPY you're HERE!!!!  Love ya, KIMBER (Your Austin, Texas Sister in Beauty)🤗😘🥰👄💞👄
I love the transitions lol
Yes Tati! As I was watching this I was thinking man I wish she would do more like these lol I love seeing different states scenery and a little bit of your life is so refreshing. Also, the makeup you are wearing is nice to see in different lightnings so its a plus! Have fun in Texas! 👢
omg I'm so excited your moving to Texas!! I've grown up here
Bievenidos to Texas!!!!! You're gonna love it here!!!! As a born and raised native, I hope you and James make many happy memories and times here!!!!
Coming to Dallas 🤞 ??    Hopefully I can meet my favo beauty guru someday!
I was just saying I need to find a vloger to watch so please please do some vloging
I am so excited and happy for you and especially that you and your husband are embarking on this new journey together- many blessings on your new home and look forward to your future videos - blessings always
Welcome to Texas!!! I’m in Fort Worth. I’ve watched your channel for years and love that you are back!!
I’m so happy for you. It’s been a long time since we have seen so much joy, and just pure happiness on your face. I venture to say, since your wedding ❤️
I hope you are happy there and meet your peeps. 🙃
Loved the behind the scenes of your life!! Looking forward to seeing Texas!

Welcome to Texas! It's beautiful here 🥰
Thank you for sharing this with us
Keep all the shoes🤩
I have two best friends who live in Texas and my fam just moved to GA so now I am only one in CA. I love vlogs.
More and more!
This was great! Definitely do more vlogging!!!! I'm  currently planning a big across the country away from my homeland as well. Scary but also exciting! Love you, Tati! 💛
Texas gal here and I’m so excited y’all are moving here. Welcome to Texas Tati and James!! 🤠
So happy for you Tati!
I was born & raised here in Texas & you are going to love it!!!!! I’m so happy for you!
Tati!! We are going to be neighbors! I live in Oklahoma. Praying your move goes well and that God blesses your new journey! (And oh my goodness! Why did I get emotional while you were packing up the makeup?) XO!!
How exciting!!! I'm in Texas. Marlena and Rich Lux are in Houston
I have grown up in Texas and would never want to live anywhere else. I love this state. Be prepared to drive for a very long time and still be in the same state.
Yay!!! Tati takes Texas!!!! Welcome! Glad to have you here!!!
MY LIFE IS MADE!!!!! DFW girl here, I’m excited for the possibility of seeing you!!!!!!
Yayyyyy Omg so happy you’re moving to Texas!! I live here 💜💜💜💜
Oh yay !! Welcome to Texas !! I hope you love it !
Happy y’all are moving here! I’m from Galveston, but lived in LA for a hot minute. TX is truly a cleanse for the soul. Especially Austin (LT area).
So excited for you in this next chapter! You can do it!!!!
I'm moving next week to a different country with my husband, 7 y old daughter and 7months baby 😉 stressful time though exciting at the same time! Good luck, Tati xx
I live in Tennessee and if there is one other place I would live it is Texas! Everyone is so friendly and there is so much space! I hope you love it
Tati! I love to see your videos. I'm 69 yrs. young; and I enjoy your content! I can see the love of Christ in your face, and in your voice! Congratulations on your new move. It is my prayer that you and James and Puka will be very happy for a long time! God bless you guys. Love you, Kristie
Welcome to Texas (home to HEB, Bucees and Whataburger)  It is a beautiful State and there is so much to see and do.
Congratulations on the move! Texas is great! I moved here 7 years ago and you can’t beat the weather…..most days. Good luck ! Can’t wait to see you in Texas!
Welcome to Texas!! So excited to have you in my state ❤️❤️
Ohhhh like Safiya, they.moved to North Carolina.
TEXAS!!!
A Tati vlog?!? I’m soon keen for this!!
Where in Texas?
So happy for you! Welcome to Texas. I hope I’ll get to see you at a random place .. hugs and love from Texas
Tati...I'm LOVING everything about this video! Congratulations on your new home! Enjoy the moment!!!
Yay!!! I’m in Dallas, TX!!! I’m from Florida and I love living TX!
Loved the vlog style video!!
Texas!!! Wow!! Congratulations on your move!!! Will you divulge how you guys came to that decision at all?? ✨💖💖✨
You’ll love Texas!
I LOVE LOVE LOVE this! So happy for you and James! Post more of these videos 💕
Yay welcome to Texas. We moved to north Dallas last year from CA. Best thing we have ever done.
Awe. It's good to hear James voice! Congrats on the move!
I like it all !
Yay! I guessed right!
I'm so excited for you I could cry!!!❤😍
Loved this, you are such a great vlogger. Welcome to Texas, I hope you still love it in 2 months when we’re roasting in the summer temps.
I’m soooooooo excited for this new era of content ♥️♥️
Yay, Vlogs!!!!!
See ya soon.☺
Wishing you the best of luck!
My first assumption was Austin. It seems like many people are moving from LA to TX.
One more thing I do want to say. I'll be thirty-nine this year, and seeing someone around my age make these strides and new beginnings reminds me that the rest of the world is not moving on without me, that people our age can be just as relevant and entertaining as those so much younger that dominate platforms. No shade to the younger people who find this comment, but as a Millennial/Gen-Xer, it's always a pleasure to be reminded that, no matter how much I miss AOL, I'm not a relic.
Girl!! Welcome to Texas <3
LOVING the Vlog!!
i knew it im so excited you will love it trust me
I'd loooove to see a colab with Angelica Nyqvist once you're settled in Texas!
SOOO excited for you guys! 🥰 Congratulations on this new beginning ♥️
I ❤️ tati vlogs!!
I loved James’ recommendation video, so I miss him popping in. Been on this ride with you for awhile, so I am curious to see what’s in the future
It’s so weird. I had a feeling you were moving to Texas when you announced that you were moving. Love Texas! Can’t wait to move there some day!
Yayyy Texas! Welcome to the Lonestar State!
Welcome to Texas! As a native I can’t imagine living anywhere else! Hope you love it here as much as I do!
Love vlogging Tati
I loved this video!  YES to part2!!
Congrats on the move! I love your vlogs keep ‘‘em coming 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Yay will be neighbors ❤️💯✨✨🎈❤️🙌🏼🤩
I’m obsessed with your baby Steinway so beautiful. I’d love to hear you play!
I would absolutely love if you would start to vlog!
Im excited for u tati 🤍
Hello from Texas and welcome!!! Of course you have friends here you have us!!! ;) 😉  good luck on your move
Make sure you have slippers !😂  Comfort a must.
Plot twist: Tati is pregnant and doesn't know it yet and that's why she's craving popsicles 🥰🥰
Love everything about this!!!!
Tati, I don't know if you'll see this, but I think I speak for many when I say that you are a natural vlogger. This feels like we're on the phone, like you're giving us a tour while we're on Skype or something, sharing your excitement. I don't know, I hate to use the word 'relatable' because it's hackneyed to suggest that celebrities do normal things, but this is relatable in the sense of 'hey, my friend Tati called me to show me her new digs.'
Best wishes for your new move! Good night!
Tati, you are amazing at vlogging. Keep them coming!! 🙏💜
Thanks for sharing your journey with us. Good luck in Texas!
Yes more vlogs 😍
Lol I knew when you said weather and more land I knew you were moving to Texas! As a born and raised Texen welcome darlin'  you won't regret it! So excited for y'all!
Awesome Tati. Loved this video. Rest up. You'll be unpacking before you know it. Looking forward to seeing your new place.
I would love for you to do my make-up!
Hope the move went well!!! Love this type of vlog ❤️ xx
Please take us on your new journey! Love seeing more of your lifestyle & every day moments as well
I’m currently in Texas and desperately want to go back to Western Washington.
Loved this video. Very excited to watch your new journey. Wishing you and James nothing but the best during this transition! Yay!!!!! Its so exciting to see you just being yourself and you've got your glow back!
Would love to see you vlogging. As I'm not really into make up but I love watching you and your chats. You're so funny and relatable. Be great to see your new life in texas. Wishing you all the luck in the world with your journey to have a baby 🤞🤞🤞🤞
💜💜💜💜
Excited for the vlogs yayyyyy
We've had a lot of fun here. Thank you. Good luck on your new adventure. So happy for you two.☺
Congratulations on your decision and on your move. I know what a tough thing that is! My husband and I have moved many times did his job. And I know that transitions are difficult sometimes. Even if they are positive. Will be keeping you covered in prayer! God bless!
Awwww don't leave Seattle!!   Jk...there are other great places to live that PROB don't have the homeless issues we have going on here. It's really sad to see and scary to be around.   I loooooove TX. I am from Austin, which is the BEST city in TX! Lol not biased or anything.....glad you found a great place!
Love the vlog! Can’t wait for part 2!
Moving on to bigger and better things.  Congratulations, Tati and family!  Looking forward to what's to come.  I know it's gonna be awesome.
It’s funny that you’re actually moving to Texas, because in the last video when you mentioned moving I thought to myself “she’s 100% moving to Texas” and I was reminded of that thought as I was clicking on this video lol. Welcome to Texas, I hope you have a great time here and find everything you’re looking for! Can’t wait to hear about/see your adventures. ❤️
Definitely want to see more vlogs from you I’m loving it!
Excited for your next chapter! More vlogs please! :)
Tati… I could not be happier for you and James!  Warmed my heart watching your excitement! I am LIVING for this content…you did an excellent job and I would love to hang out in a vlog with you! Best of luck!
The “what’s up” at yourself in the mirror 14:13 killed me 😂 so proud of you and happy for you and James! You’re a lovely human ☺️
Im so happy for you!! Youve been through a lot and deserve to do what makes you happy. Texas definitely does have a lot of real estate options and great food, i could never move there though, not with the craziness from Abbott and Cruz and being able to control a womens decision, hell no. Marlena is there now, maybe you guys can reconnect
I'm so xcited for you and James.  I love this blog style tati
I’m so excited for you. Having lived in Texas and now owning land and working towards a similar vision (minus the glam cuz I don’t do makeup 🤪), you are going to love that lifestyle so much more. A simple life, homemaking, enjoying family, hobbies, the outdoors... that’s such a dream. I can’t wait for you to settle into it and I’ll be rooting for you from my 10 acres in Idaho!! 🥳
Welcome to Texas!!  BTW, the beaches are beautiful here, don’t let anyone tell you different.
I liked this vlog and want to see more of your move.
Yayyyyyyy, good luck with the move Tati! You've got this! Can't wait to come along for the journey. Your Pukka is going to be happy no matter where he goes, as long as he's with you (and a yard won't hurt 😉)
Welcome to the Southwest! So happy for you and James and your new start. ❤️ Yes I love to see blogging of whatever interests people have,  it gives me ideas of things to try at home.
Loved this vlog ❤ I hope the move went well! X
I love it ❤️❤️❤️❤️ your puppy is so cute
I could watch Tati sanding a wall lol(random but u get my point!) Thank you for sharing a whole other side and vlogging, please do more ... Also I LOVE it in full speed watching Tati do her make up, there's nothing like it, Tati is so beautiful and I love the whole process.  Been watching for years and years x
Yes Tati!! My guess was Utah 😉 So excited for your move and I can’t wait to see what you share. You’ve got me excited to move too, it’s been months and we’ve found nothing so have been feeling a bit deflated. You’ve lifted my spirits no end 😘
Tati so happy to see you happy. I need this inspiration!
I've always wanted to live in Texas
I enjoyed this vlog so much, pls do more! 🙏 Also supper happy & excited for your move!!!! All the best in Taxes ❤️❤️❤️
Blessings to you Tati on your new journey!! I can tell how excited you are for a fresh start.

I love this for you guys!
Cali to TX  ❣🙏🏽💚 All the best.  *Feel like there's a mass exodus from CA to TX...*  😯😎💖😊
I’m in Dallas I’m so excited. I lived in LA, anytime I went to a CVS I would hope to see you, and now you’re coming to Texas!  I still would never go up to you because personal space but so cool, I hope you love it here as much as I do. Moved here right when the pandemic happened and it was the best choice
Texas! How wonderful 🐎❤🐎 Good luck in your new home 💗💗💗
You decide what it is you feel comfortable sharing! With that said YESSSSSS WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT ALL! ❤️ my daughter and her boyfriend just moved to Texas, his office is right inside the cowboys stadium and he  had to sign a wavier to say he wouldn’t tape practice’s and show any other teams!!!
so wholesome
I love this sort of content. I’m so excited for your fresh start and can’t wait to share it with you.
Yay, Tati, your moving to Texas. That’s where I live. Keep the vlogs coming good luck with everything.
Loved this !!!!!
Oh I’m so here for allll of this!
Congratulations on your move and welcome to Texas! I’ve been here since 1981 or 1982. That just aged me. Lol I hope you and James love it!

Congratulations, Tati! I'm so excited for you! I always loved making a start in a new home, but we've been in this one in the N. Ga mountains for 20 years now and just paid off our mortgage the other day. Wishing you that feeling of home very soon! ~Cynthia

Tati. You are so inspirational ❤  I love you and your channel. You have taught me so much through a screen! Thank you and I very much enjoy you letting us be apart of this new part of your life. I wish you and James all the best 💛

Yes! Yes! Yes! More vlogs please! ❤️
My husband & I moved to Texas last year & have been staying with my daughter until we could get settled.  We finally got a house & will be doing some renovating as well.  I do have family here - my 3 adult daughters & 4 of my grandkids are in Texas so our new home is close to them.  Even though I've been here a year I still feel like a newby, but welcome to Texas! I'm glad you were able to find a home with land.  We wanted to do the same & build a house but it's way too expensive where I am.
Yay! Texas! I am a military brat and in the military now, Texas is where I call home. Best of luck!
Girl you look great without make up too! Also, love seeing other sides of your life!
Love this vlog style, please keep doing it aside from your beauty videos
People like vlogs now more than the traditional videos so i think you should try to do both!
I love this 💜  more please!!!! thank you, thank you, thank you! 💜
I’m feeling you as we are preparing to move from the US to Korea… moving is stressful!
Welcome to Texas! I was born and raised in Austin. It’s a great state. ❤️ Can’t wait to see you exploring.
I feel so excited for you! You seem so happy and thrilled to be moving. I’m excited to see your vlogs along your new journey! Congratulations
I really like this type of content with you. But, I like everything you do, no matter what it is. So, be Blessed! You really seem excited about your new path and I am so happy for you.
I knew it was either Arizona or Texas! Seems to be where everyone is moving to. 😂❤
Honestly I’m here for the Tati vlogs 😍😍😍
Love it
Love you Tati 😽🌴🏝
Love love ❤️ keep up the blog PLEASE TATI blessings to you and yours in this new journey
Loved the Vlog and would love to see even more lifestyle content from you! But, create whatever inspires you! We all love everything you do 🥰❤️
Why didn't you use any of the green shadows??
Girl, you don't need an event to wear cute shoes! I just wear them even if i look extra sometimes 😂😂
I love this style of video! Congrats on the big move!
Yeehaw! I’m from Texas and we’ll love having you in this state!
I sooooo guessed Texas! I can just see you there, I think you’re a Texas girl at heart!
I knew it!! Recently several youtubers have moved to Texas lol. So happy for you Tati ❤️
I can only speak for myself, but I love knowing more! Whatever you decide to share I’ll be happy to watch! I’m so happy that you guys are happy!! Cannot wait for more house updates!!
I love this vlog stuff!  Keep doing this!
Absolutely adored this vlog!!!! Yes please to more💖
I love you vlogginggggg😍
How do you keep Pooka’s face so clean? My maltese has tear stains. Helena
Welcome to Texas! ❤️❤️ You’re going to love it here.
Wow.. 🙋‍♀️ Texan here love that your moving to our state didn’t expect that.. congrats
Love this vlog! I enjoy watching you interact with James and sweet Pooka! And I’m so excited you are coming to Texas. You are the second beauty creator that’s has moved here. I’m super excited to see more vlogs! ❤️
I’m in Texas, and when you announced your move, I thought “Texas would be a good place for you.” And I was right! Yeehaw indeed! Welcome to your new home!
I love vlogs and I’m sucker for videos of people moving houses and doing renovations , so please continue 🥰
Congrats Tati!! So happy for you and James ♥️ Literally can’t wait for all your Vlogs, wishing you all the love and good vibes in your new chapter 🥰
Living for TATI vlogs!!!! The content we didn’t know we needed! So happy for you both on the move! ❤️
I'm an Oklahoma girl who lives in California...I'm jealous Texas is  great and I miss the weather variety, the people, and the cost of living!
I would do at least one vlog a week.
Love the positivity in this video  🙏🏻 Congrats on the new move 🏡
I love this!! I always love your makeup videos but I absolutely love the vlogging too! Please make more videos like this!
Tati I love love love this! My daughter is 20 and we watch you religiously! On a different note I love the hair color, really, really pretty. Sending love, good vibes and prayers your way!
I don't understand why you should speak about the apartment as it is the worst thing ever. Some people would appreciate it. You seem to quickly go back to your habits.. I thought for a second you have returned with a completely other mindset..
Thank you Tati for sharing your moving. I’m moving too and it’s so stressful but your video is giving me courage! Please share much more LIFESTYLE videos/vlogs. Sending you lots of love and light! ❤️
I really enjoy your vlogs and welcome to Texas! I was born here and have lived here my whole life. Hope you love being a Texan! 😁
Omg Tati vlogssssss!!! Yayyyyyyyyyyy 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
All the best to you and James.  Fresh start!!  I can’t wait to see your videos from your new space. ❤️😁
OMG....OMG.....OMG .... Tati just said they are moving to Texas. Yeeeeee, I'm so happy. I had a strong feeling that they are moving to either Texas or Florida. I live in Texas and I love it here. Welcome, so happy to have Tati and James. Texas just got richer with two wonderful people. Love, love, love. I'm so excited.
Post whatever makes you happy! Trust me - we’ll watch! Best of luck and much happiness in your new place 🤩
As someone who moved away from Seattle 9 years ago (and also a former Jackson Timberwolf!) you are going to miss that Bartells in the background there @11:50. Best of luck to you guys!
I moved to Texas from Cali in February!
What’s the song playing while you’re packing your makeup?
Tati I love this content!!!! 💜💜💜
Loving the vlogging and getting to see a little of your life. Hopefully you do part 2! All the best with your move, enjoy making beautiful memories in your new home 🏡 ❤️
I thought you are moving to Florida 😔
Please branch out as you are planning. Your makeup reviews have gotten stale, and I say that with love. I continue to watch because I enjoy watching YOU, but I would enjoy other content
omg texas sounds PERFECT for you guys! So so happy for you <3
Yes please vlog more.
Love these type of videos! More please!
HI JAMES 👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼
I’m SO hoping you moved to the San Antonio area!  But I’m guessing more towards Dallas.  XD
Congratulations to you and James! I am so happy for you Tati. 💗💗💗💗
So happy for you 😀
Happy for your new chapter… the outro was definitely the fave part of this video. Can’t wait to see you soar!❤️
Native Texan here.... Welcome! Love the new vlog style. Hope y'all are ready for our springtime weather 😵‍💫🌞🤠
I’m so excited you are moving to Texas. We are blessed to have you
I'm packing up to move now too so it's nice to see I'm not alone in this mess. <3
TEXAS!!! I am THRILLED! As a native Texan, we welcome you with open arms! I love to watch any part of your life that you’re willing to share!
Loved this do more vlogs x ❤️🇬🇧
I guessed it was Texas or Tennessee because that’s where everyone is moving.
This was so fun to watch thank you Tati! More life vlogs for sure 🙏🏼
This qas so much fun to watch. And you are so adorable and fun. In texas connect with another youtuber, i believe her. Hannel is malibu.

LOVE this video you look so happy awe this makes me happy 😊
Which city in Texas?
Loved this vlog! I’m really enjoying you letting us into your life again, & bringing us on this journey with you. I love the makeup videos, but would love you to start vlogging more too. It was also lovely to see Puka & to (kinda) see James as well! I understand he wants to stay away from the internet, but he has definitely been missed on your channel ❤️
I am LOVING the Tati vlog!!! Please keep them coming!
good! youll love it here in TX. seattle and los angelos is run by evil people everyone has fled .
Love this content Tati!
Welcome to Texas!
Love the makeup but girl, whatever you post I’ll watch ❤️ again Lord please send Tati and James some baby dust, thank you, amen 🙏🏻
I am so excited to watch these vlogs!!! Hope to see your new home and any new endeavors you’re taking in Texas!
Ok I’m so loving these types of videos Tati.
Yes I love these kinds of videos. Love organization videos too! I’m glad you’re doing what you need to do for yourself and your sanity.❤️🤗
Happy Trails :)
Don’t stick to the makeup!  Of course we love the makeup, but we also love you and want to hear anything you’d like to share!
Welcome to Texas! 🎉
Love that you added vlogging!! Good luck in your New Home and Texas. Blessed 🙏🏻🥰💯
Did you really say freak of the week? 😂 You’re secretly a beautiful dork.  Im happy for your move to TX! I’ve ALWAYS wanted to live there, but I’m from KS. Them there are fighting words! I guess we compete w TX over chili & other things. So you’re def going to have some glorious chili down there!!       KS & TX are both in tornado alley.  I’m not sure if you’ve lived w tornadoes before, but don’t let them frighten you away!   If you can’t beat them-join them. I’m a storm/tornado chaser. You don’t have to go that far, but you do have to RESPECT them... know them.           Set up your storm shelter with appropriate items that make you feel SAFE. Not plush blanket safe. Emergency radio safe. Depending on where you live in TX, your shelter might be in the basement. If the water table is too high it will be a reinforced room upstairs.  You may wanna hang out downstairs in your shelter rather than sprint downstairs at 2am when the tornado sirens go off!  Eventually you’ll be outside filming them so we all can see!       Who knows?  That might be a new seasonal niche?  See what beauty/hair products hold up to tornado/storm season in TX. 😂
I am moving from Canada to Texas! I can’t wait. I can’t stay here anymore Covid has made everyone crazy. I need to go somewhere where is more somewhat more freedom.
Yes we love the vlogs!
Loved this video and would definitely watch more vlogs. Congrats on you move. 💜💜
Long time subscriber and I never comment… I have to say, I absolutely loved this style of vlog! My 4 year old watch it with me.. 😂
I love your vlogging. Looking forward to seeing more of it!
Beautiful Tati! Yes to your vlog!💖💖💖
I absolutely loved this video and seeing this beautiful warm humility filled Tati.. I just love how chilled and silly and herself she was. I’m so happy to see her finally feeling safe and a little more open with her audience. Tati you deserve to embrace our love and support. We got you and we love you ❤️❤️🙏🏼🙏🏼   Oh and Puka you are everything 😩😍😇
Love vlogs! Please continue them!!! Also love that y’all are moving to TX. I’m in Louisiana. May God continue to bless y’all during this new chapter of your lives. 🙏🏻🙏🏻
I love the vlogs 👍🏻☺️
Omgosh I loved this style of video!!! It was so fun and upbeat!!! Love it!!! Also welcome to Texas Tati!!! Im confident you'll absolutely love it here!
Texas!!!!!!!!
Woohoo!!! Can't wait to see your new life in Texas!!! I loved this vlog - good luck with the move xx

I love your vlogs! Please do more <3
So excited for you!  Keep doing vlogs!  💜
Love the vlog content! You are so inspiring Tati! This fresh start is going to be amazing, God is paving the way for you guys! ❤️
YES MA'AM!!!!!  AWESOMENESS!!!!  You are doing great ❤️❤️ Keep going!
Welcome to TX.   LA it’s so expensive and unnecessary when you can create such amazing content from anywhere in the world
I am so excited to hear about this new move !!! I have a feeling this next chapter is going to be all you have prayed for and much much more. Nothing but good vibes coming from Florida !!!
Texas is so lucky to have you! Thank you for sharing your journey with us and we love you wherever you are!
Yayy a vlog !!! I would love to see more of  this type of content ❣️ so happy for u
Welcome to Texas!
Welcome to Texas
I’m so happy for you Tati. I love more of these kind of videos. Now I want a popsicle 😂 Blessings to you both. 😘💛🙏
How exciting!!!!!! Thank you for bringing us along!! 😁
LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! THIS VIDEO! Please do more vlogs like this. I loved the behind the scenes feel and personal touch. Here’s to the new house! 🏡🦋
Welcome to Texas!
I’d love watching more vlogs  from you. I’ve fallen out of love with makeup in the last couple years so I strongly prefer other types of vids
I loved, loved, loved this video. ❤️. I'm so looking forward to more vlogs from your new place. Good luck. And I'm hoping you can find your wedding ring 🙏.
How did I guess she was moving to Texas??? See you soon ❤️
I knew it!!!! I had a feeling you would go to Texas. You will fit into that world so well!😍thank you for sharing this btw I enjoyed it so keep them vlogs coming! Love you❤️ I hope everything went well with the moving ☺️
I love you blog! Do more
I literally would watch you vacuum😂 that's how much I like your videos!
tati, this is edited so well. so tasteful. SO well done. wow. i love the clever strategies you use for vlogging, like propping the phone up in the shopping cart and walking around the store. it's so fun to watch plus more creative (and less obtrusive) than a selfie stick or walking around with a mini camera crew. this felt so down to earth and playful. i really can't say enough. all the best in texas~
I loved this video 🥰 I am so excited for you for this new journey!!
I live on Vancouver Island, so basically the same weather as Seattle. I moved from the sunniest city in Canada (Calgary! 335 days a year of sun) to the island and it's been a really hard adjustment. I don't miss winter and the cold, but I do miss the sun being out regardless of the weather... even if it's too cold to be outside to enjoy it. It's weird that I have to turn on lights in the day time to do stuff because it's always freaking cloudy. I wanted to live by the ocean and now I do, but boy the glamour sure wore off quick when I realised how cloudy and rainy it is. I will make do tho because this is what I wanted and I have to live the consequences of my actions lol  EDIT: SPIDERS. They're so many! And they're year-freaking-round here. I am trying not to lose my mind, but also, I am going to lose my mind living here.
Welcome to the Texas family!! Im in dallas, hope you can do a meet and greet!!
Yes to the 2nd vlog and we need more of James again, can’t wait for the new adventure y’all 😂 mwuah
Why’d I know it was Texas since the last video lol
I love seeing vlog real life content!
I loved the vlog Tati!!! More of this please! Good luck! 🍀❤️
Texas? 😦 Big change!! Excited for your journey ahead, and looking forward to hearing all about it!
Love this format! Congratulations on your move. I think Texas will surprise you with their hospitality. Definitely a great place for cute shoe appreciation as well! 😆😍 Girl. You can make friends in line at the HEB over a conversation about cute shoes! I grew up in the South, have family in the DFW Area and lived in Austin. Wonderful experiences and lovely people everywhere I went. I pray they all find you and give you a warm welcome and make you feel right at home! And you sweet hubby and adorable pup as well, of course!
My puppy Heidi (aka Dogface Killer) is anti social too old people be warned 🤣😂🤣😂
I knew it! I bet Austin?
I can’t wait to see your new place, have a safe trip
I love the vlog!!!! Please do more!!! 😍
Wow Tati so exciting. Please keep vlogging loving it
I just had a feeling you’d come to Texas, yay!!! Welcome to Texas 💕
I was more excited that puka hearing James 😂😂😂 was so hoping he would pop on just for a sec , by far my fav couple 🥰🥰🐶🥰🥰

I'm excited for you!  It will be so fun to follow this journey with you as you move and get all set up in the new place.  God bless you!  Prayers for a brighter sunnier future!
Safe travel blessings 🙏 Can't wait to see your new spot! 💖
I moved to Texas about 3-4 years ago and I've loved it here. But of course you're moving here just as I'm about to move back to Colorado for a while to be with family lol 😂
We love this!!!!
I love the Steinway!
Love, love, love the vlogs...don't stop! Wishing you all the very best on your new adventure.  May it be the beginning of the most exciting chapter of your life, you deserve it ❤😙
Absolutely love this 🤗🤗🤗🤗 keep it coming 🙏🏻❤️
Welcome to Texas! Us Texas girls gotta stick together so just know, we got your back! Can’t wait to see what you share next!
Love this format and that we got to see more of how you are feeling and what you are doing. Your makeup videos are amazing but you don’t have to stick to just one thing 😊
Well i sure hope you got to go to Seattle Coffee Gear when you were there
I'm  really happy for you Tati. I think Texas will be the perfect place for you to start a new chapter in your life that will be manifested into a healthier environment for you and your husband. It's a perfect place to start a family and you'll get to live a more fulfilling life away from the cut throat lifestyle that is here in L.A. I've always wanted to see you in a more relaxed vlogging way. I look forward to seeing you vlog more when your out riding horses, planting your new garden and watching your fur baby and human babies run around a big yard living there best life together ❤.  Good luck in your travels and I look forward to watching your journey continue in your new home state.
Can't wait to see your new place. Good luck with the new house.
Go happy for u .
Welcome to the greatest country on earth. I hope you love it.
We love you Tati! Good luck on your move! We'll be waiting right here for you ❤️
Yay let us see! I’m excited to see where in Texas you move! I live Austin, Texas and the whole state is so beautiful. Yay welcome!
We stand the v-longing. Keep it up!!
Is this a moving vlog or a Tati plays with Puka compilation? I'm living for it
Texas!  Yay!!!  Look me up!!!  I’ll show you around!! -Donna
Omg I’m so happy that you have moved already watching this. Really feeling the packing stress 😬😬😬
Part two and more vlogs please!  Good luck in your new home in the beautiful state of Texas.
I’m so excited for you Tati!!! 💗💗💗 sending all the good packing/moving vibes. We just did a cross-country move in August last year from Montana to Florida and it was the craziest but best thing for our little family. Wishing you guys the best!! 😘🎉
Yeayyyy!!!!! I’m so excited y’all are coming to TEXAS!!!!! If you need a new friend in Texas, I got you. Lol!
Yayyyy! I’m loving the new Tati vlogs!
So happy for you and James on your fresh start! Lots of luck in your new home!!!!
I love watching vlogs. I would love to see more vlogs from you. ❤
Please do more vlogs ❤️🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
I'm hearing people move to Texas a lot right now. Angelica Nykvist just moved too (fellow beauty YTer) excited to see everyone's experience of the place. I've never been but thinking of a road trip that way.
Texas girl here! Welcome you are gonna love it! 🥰🥰🙌🙌
20 seconds in… I see Pooka and I’m like damn, how do I know her name.. Tati once in a blue shows or talks about her dog. I just  Must love Tati! ❤️❤️❤️
I loooooooooveeeeeeeeed this video! I'm so so so happy for you! And I'm soso happy for this new chapter! Ahhhhhhhhh 🎉🐶🎈
Yay Texas!  Do what you want to do. It's your channel.  You don't need anyone's  permission.  People will watch or they won't.  That's on them. Not you ,😁
My guess was TX
Welcome to Texas!!!!
YES!  I was hoping you said TX.  Just please don't change TX like Seattle.  We love our TX RED! Yes, we do!!  Love the vlogging.  Do more!
Don’t bring your liberal vote with you,,
Soooo fun with a vlog <3 Hopping for more vlogs
I personally, love EVERYTHING you do! So these vlog type videos make me really excited because it lets us in a little closer to you and we love that!  I’m also happy for you guys for moving, what an exciting new chapter! You guys deserve every good thing that comes to you.. love you all! 💕
I'm happy for you guys! May the Good Lord continue to bless you and your new home today and always!🎊🎉🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Also, as a native Texan, some must sees are Fredricksburg, Lost Maples State Park, the Frio River, Gruene, South Padre Island...gosh, so much. It's a beautiful state. I have lived in nearly every major city here.
Excited for you guys and your new adventure
I thought maybe you were going to go to Texas or Florida. It was a toss up. Welcome to Texas! I love it here. 💜 although the day you are posting this we are having some crazy 🤣😳 weather. Tell James “hi” miss seeing him with you in videos. Really miss your fun unboxing PR videos. Those were SO fun!!! Happy moving!
Yessss, keep vlogging.  Loved it!
I knew you guys were moving there!! I had a feeling in my heart that that's where it was going to be. You deserve wide open spaces and sunshine and it seems like that is the perfect place for it. So happy for you and James ❤
Great Vlog!!  I've wanted to try those Sigma shadows!!!
I knew it would be Texas!...hahaha...plz tell me its Dallas!!
Hey 👋 fantastic to hear you are moving to Texas . Not surprisingly as you are both good souls 🙏🙏🙏🙏 I live in the UK , but vibe with the Texas vibe 🙏🙏🙏
Tati is a horse woman?? I had no idea!
This video made me feel so excited and hopeful for your future. We here in Texas are anxiously awaiting to welcome you into our hearts and into the state we call home. ♡♡♡
This is so exciting! I am Texas born and raised, and it is such a good choice for yall! Excited to have you here in Texas!
Please keep vlogging! Love the make up but love seeing a little more of your life and your creativity with editing this type of video! ❤️
Tati I love Texas!!! My daughter was born in Texas, I would move back TOMORROW!!! The land, people, food ,homes etc Congratulations!!!!!  Also please link that song at the end LOVE IT!!  Need it in my library!!! Do all the things don’t limit to makeup!!!
SHE'S BACK ♥️!!! I loved this vlog, do more! I was reliving your angst about moving your piano; I too, had a baby grand and things were packed and stored without me being there. When it came time to have our stuff delivered, I found that they DIDNT TAKE THE LEGS OFF the piano and it was stored on its side. It's a miracle the legs didn't break when they put it in the house. I'm still furious b/c we trusted the company so much. I see they packed your piano properly 😊. I'm excited for you, James and Puka and can't wait to hear all about your new place and your journey there. Tati, I'm so happy to see you back to yourself. Safe travels 😊♥️
I loved this and your fresh face at the beginning.  Good luck ☘️ with your move.
WELCOME TO TEXAS!!!!!
Hi Tati and James love the vlog style videos. Please do more.
I just bought my first home this past weekend and am moving soon! This is the perfect time for me to watch your video!
❤️❤️❤️ LOVE this format. A little glimpse into your life and reality. ❤️❤️❤️
So excited for you! I’m in Oklahoma and although we may have a red river rivalry, we still love our southern neighbors! I hope you and your family are able to settle in stress free!
Love the vlog style! Congrats on the move to Texas!
Vlogs, make-up, home stuff... We'll take it all!! :D
I had a feeling it was TX! I hope you show us some videos of the renovations! I’d definitely watch.

So exciting! As a person who has moved several times for hub's career training, I can tell you it takes about 8-10 months to acclimate, make friends, start growing "roots". Good luck, y'all!

I love it ❤️ I wish you all the best in your new start. I’ll be visiting Texas for the first time all the way from across the world in the summer, its sounds beautiful there 💫💫💫
This video format is the best. We get to see all of you ❤️🤗
LOVE this kind of video!
Omg i can’t believe you’re coming here!! I like these videos even better than the makeup!
✨Omg! I guessed it in your last video! I knew it was Texas! So happy for you!!!   And I know you’ll never see this but just gonna say it, I absolutely LOVE your hair color. I feel like this is your natural hair color and you look stunning. Best to you and James and so honored to be a part of your community to keep you company on your move. That is so sweet!!! 💖💖💖💖
Also, if you happen to move to the Fort Worth area I can be your friend 😂🤣 we moved here about 6 months ago and my only friend here is my little dog. Sad but true 😂
I’m happy to watch everything you post, so feel free to explore outside of makeup! Please do a part 2!!! 🙏❤️
I love these new vlogs.
This video was so much fun to watch...Congratulation on your new home in Texas, great place to be!  Loved how Pooka cheered you on....so gosh darn cute!!
Yesss 🙌🏼 more videos just like this Tati I LOVE it 😍 super excited for you James and 🐶❤️ Can’t wait to see your new home 🏡  Love you so much !!
But can you like, do renovation videos of your new house?! Would be fully committed to watch those!
So exciting! I’m from Seattle and lived here all my life and am moving to Houston in a couple months! I hope you love it ❤️
Tati showing glimpses of this smaller (but beautiful!) townhome is the MOST relatable thing. Having to downsize for a while, while she caught her barrings. I LOVE this video for that reason. Cannot wait to see the new home and journey!!!!!
I love this type of vlog!
Be YOU, Tati!  Makeup, lifestyle, food, bare faced or makeup, frustration or joy- be the authentic you we enjoy!
So excited to see more vlogs x x
More Vlogs please! 💕
Seems texas is up and coming in the makeup vlog world.
When you first shared you were moving, I said to myself that it would be awesome if you moved here to Texas. Oh my gosh, WELCOME WELCOME to our amazing state!!! ⭐️
I gotta be honest you look fantastic without makeup, equally as good with or without!
I'm so excited for you both 💓.  I hope James is going well as well. Please tell me I am not the only one who is missing tati and James unboxing videos. 😍
Welcome to Texas, Tati!!!💖🤠 hope it’s everything you want it to be 🥰

Hi Tati, I could not resist leaving a comment on this video. I moved from Washington last November 2021 to DFW. Just like you I have never lived anywhere else and am from Seattle. I enjoyed watching your blog and have been through the same packing experience. I look forward to seeing how you adjust and your impressions of Texas from a PNW point of view. Hope you like it here!
Heyyy I was right naming Texas as the first state! Lol You’ll love it there! I have family there and they love it. I visit there and I love it. So happy for your new chapter, Tati! Onto bigger happier things!

G'day from Melbourne Australia Tati!  Absolutely LOVE that you're making your dream come true.  Texas will be blessed that Tati, James and Pooka have arrived.   All the best.  Don't stress about anything cos I'm a firm believer that things happen for a reason  ... either to test us, teach us, confirm us and any reason is towards a better moment.  Stay safe you guys ... and enjoy new beginnings together.   PS it was awesome to hear James's voice once again
Love the vlog style! Please keep doing them

Lower gas prices too..that alone would make me want to leave....
Subbed for the vlogs.
OMG!!!! Watching your last video I was all "wouldnt be funny that I'm moving back to Texas soon, what if Tati does?"  Check out Buc-ees and HEB 😁 Huge Texas welcome!!!!
You are doing so well!!!!!  Thank you for sharing your life with us, we love you!!

Thanks for sharing these parts of your life with us, keep it up!!   Happy moving,  Texas, awesome choice!!   So many great churches there also you will love!!

U will be one state from me!I live in Louisiana!
🤠 Welcome y'all!
I've been a Texas transplant...and as an east coast girl who first moved south and then to TX for awhile I want to be very real with you. There are some wonderful things about living in TX and I hope you find everything you're looking for but expect some culture shock and be aware that if you lean at all to the left it will not be well received in many circles. Of course, there are places that are more open minded than others but my husband and I eventually had to move back to someplace where we felt more accepted.
I’m watching this shortly after you posted and there’s a Tornado Watch in Texas.   Taking them by storm Tati! 😆
Love you sharing more of your life!! Please share as much as you’re willing! Love seeing that side of you!
I love you and I love everything you are willing to share with us. I'm moving myself and I understand how it is. It's going to be my cat and me, but it's a bit overwhelming. You've totally got this!  You will be great in Texas. I am so happy for you and your new chapter, journey. Love and hugs.
whatever you post is fine, I'm just glad to see you happy
Loved this vlog! I felt like I was hanging out with a long time friend. Was amazing to see the authentic, genuinely happy, OG Tati - we missed you!  Congratulations on your move! Here’s to many happy years in Texas. 💖
I missed seeing James in your videos. It's so refreshing to have him back, even if we can't see him, his presence is so positive and fun ❤️
Congratulations
I love this!
I LOVE THE VLOGS!!!!!!
Welcome to Texas! We love our shoes here, so don’t get rid of any of those pretty shoes. ❤️❤️
My husband and I moved to Texas 4 years ago from Miami and we love it. We knew 1 person here. Best decision we made.
Jaw drop at 10:30ish!  Welcome to the Lone Star State! - Your biggest fan in TEXAS!!
Omg you will love texas! #texasmade
Jaw drop at 10:30ish!  Welcome to the Lone Star State! - Your biggest fan in TEXAS!!
Welcome to Texas y'all! We're so happy to have you 😊 I had a gut feeling y'all were moving here when you spoke about missing the sunshine, we have plenty of sunshine lol. Welcome neighbor I know you're gonna love it here 😊
5 seconds in and I'm in love!
Omg!!! Texas. Yay my home state.
Yes, please, more vlogs, more real, more open, more Puka!! 💯
So we're almost neighbors!!! I'm in Oklahoma!! Welcome to our part of the country!!!

Great for both of you! Fresh start. Looking forward to see your new life process. Xx

Why are you moving to Texas
Yes!! More vlogs❤️❤️❤️
Loved this vlog style and can’t wait to see the parts of your new home you share with us ❤️ much love to you and james! Happy new Home 🏠! Xx
Absolutely loved this content!!! Keep it coming! 💜💜💜
Vlogs please
Big moves!!  Hope it goes well and it all works in your favor.  Get a generator for when the electric grid fails in a winter storm.
I loved it, Tati. Really enjoying seeing you and sharing more, and also very excited to see your new home and how you like Texas, hoping for more vlogs🤞🏻
So happy your back!!! I knew it would be Texas!!
I loved this! I say keep with the vlogs!!  Idk, I’ve always liked you so much but this really makes you sooooo much more relatable. Is that the word? 🤔 anyway I loved it!
Excited for your new adventures in Texas.  2 years ago my family moved to a completely new place, Hawaii, where we knew no one.  We have since moved back to Alaska, where my husband and I both grew up and started our family.  But our time there was definitely sweet, challenging and the Lord blessed us and provided for us in numerous ways from a great rental(no way were we going to buy), vehicles and an amazing community of friends who we miss dearly.
So excited to watch you grow on this new journey!
I would love it if you did a live stream, just talking about life, playing with makeup in real time, just having fun.
Congratulations! Loving the vlog too!
I am absolutely so here for a Tati Vlog...I miss James but love his little voice cameos and I am soooo excited for your new adventure together.
Why is every LA person moving to Texas?
Loving how you vlog!!!
I loved this video!!! I love make up too but i liked this new side of you❤️
I pray that Tati finds/found her missing wedding ring 🙏
Texas is the BEST state...I am not biased or anything! 😉
My jaw dropped when you announced Texas is your new home!!! I live in the Austin area so holy cow I would faint if I ever ran into you! Glad you made it safe and sound! Stay safe in the storm today, that’s the one thing I don’t like about living here. 😞
I love this content!!!!
I love that a lot of content creators are moving out of LA realizing that they can create just as amazing content from other areas of the country. I feel like prior to the pandemic, contact creators moved to LA because that was the best way to really become successful. Now everyone is branching out! Good luck to you on your new travels!
SO EXCITED YOU ARE COMING TO TX! Can’t wait to see what area you end up in and all of your adventures. I’ve lived in Texas all of my life and recently settled about 20 miles north of Dallas. No matter what area of TX you’re in there’s so much to do, and as you mentioned, the food 😊
Are ya'll moving to TX??!!!??!!! That is awesome!!! Best state ever! You will LOVE it there!!! I am so excited for you. It's a totally different place and the people are awesome.
Wohooo!! Welcome to Texas Tati!! My guess was right!!!
Tati, post whatever your heart tells you to because it's YOUR channel. We'll watch whatever you post because it's you, we want to see more of you! ❤️
Did anyone else noticed the ice called No Judge Mint 😂💚 That’s punny!
Austin?
I love this vlog! Please keep doing and congratulations on the move!
This is the third beauty guru that I watch who is or has moved to Texas very recently. So weird. Texas must be the place to be. Happy for u guys. Pooka is so cute.
Ohhhhh I cannot wait to see your new place. Loved the make up with the music. Thank you and I hope it goes really well for you and your family. 💖
Omg! I haven’t even finished the video yet, i cheated to see where you’re headed and YES you’re heading to TX! I haven’t even seen where yet, BUT! You’re gonna love it here. You’ll miss the mountains. You’ll miss Safeway. And Fred Meyer. But there’s a LOT of beauty here. Can’t wait to watch the rest of this video and see where life is taking you!
WELCOME TO TEXAS! I’ll be your new family, I love my home state! 🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱
Welcome to Texas 🤗❤️ Hope you can find your pockets of peace in your new home. Best of luck!
I KNEW you were coming to Texas omgg
I prefer this to the makeup content actually. I still hope you come out with volume 2 when all is said and done, but honestly I’m hoping you get into houseplants and landscaping because I love your energy, but I’ve been more excited about home and garden content lately.
Woohoo Tati! So happy for you! Thank you for sharing your adventure with all of us! 💖
I definitely vote for vlogs!!! Loved this and love you Tati! Prayers for safe travels and a great and smooth move! So EXCITED for you guys!!❤️
I love VLOG TATI, you deserve this queen ❤️
Love the vlogs I am not watching as much makeup content these days.
My spidy senses were telling me Texas!!! Welcome!
Oh yes!!! I love you vlogging!! Bring them!!!! So happy for you :) 🥰🌸👍
More vlogs please!  I love the makeup content too, but I would love to see more vlogs.
I loved this vlog Tati ♥️ I’m totally down for this along side makeup vids. Thanks for making my day ♥️ xoxo
God bless you, James, and Pukkah! Will pray for the move and the new house to be wonderful! 👍👍👏👏👏❤️
No I’ve loved this it’s lovely to feel part of your world again I’ve missed that ! I found your channel 4 years ago when I first got sick and honestly you got me though I’m so happy for you and James! Wishing you and everyone lots of love and happiness 😇😇😇
Everyone is moving to Texas 😂  Welcome! It’s a great place to be.
Yes please Vlog.  Excited for you Tati on your move.
It seems like all is well with your soul!!! 💜 When you announced you were moving, in my mind I thought “I bet they’re moving to Texas!” Then came your announcement today. I’ve never been there myself, so I’m not sure where that even came from but am absolutely delighted for you! I’m a long time subscriber from Wisconsin. As a 911 professional, the stress in my life is elevated at times. Not to mention stress from my husband owning his own business. There was a portion of my career when you’d share videos almost daily. It was your soothing voice I’d listen to after a 12-hour shift that spoke to the beauty enthusiast in me and helped calm me before bed at night with a wholesome diversion from the crap in the world! 💖 It’s wonderful to see you moving on from a painful time to a much better season for you! I’m all for viewing more videos in vlog style. You just be sweet, authentic you, and you’ll be alright 🥰❤️💐
I'm sad you're leaving us in the PNW! I could always tell what day you were filming based on the weather! Best of luck in your new home and excited to come along for the ride!
Welcome to the great state of Texas. We are a welcoming group!!!!!
I'm so excited I feel like I'm moving too!!!! Move forward and remember there will be a tiny bit of second guessing but that's ok... You Got This!  Blessings to you guys God is so very good I know he is with you. Amen
It would be great to see more of this stuff, i love home Reno stuff so I’d love to see that too and styling stuff. ☺️
Omg love a Tati vlog yay! ❤❤❤
Definitely mix in vlogging
This is so awesome! Welcome to Texas, Tati!

A fresh start, love you guys ❤️

I'm so exited for y'all's  new chapter! Welcome to TX y'all . Would love to see you on the streets 💖✨
So happy for you and love you, Tati. We’ll be here for you every new step of your journey! God’s going to bless you guys so much. Also WHAT IS THAT DRINK from Starbucks??? Please & thank you
Packing's such an unfun process.  That was a lot of stuff that you guys had still out, too, a day before the packers/movers came... sympathies on what dealing with that must have been like :-\
As a native Texan I’m so happy you’re moving here! I hope you love it here and have so much happiness and peace in your new home❤️❤️
Totally loved this !!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You’re gonna love it in Texas I live in Houston born and raised.   You’ll find friendly faces everywhere and we have the best food in Texas. Good luck ❤️

Sooo excited for you guys!!! Loved watching this 💕💕💕
No tati I am really cool with your shopping vlogs that you used to do. And I don't care if you've vlog. You could start doing fashion. You could start just having us pall around with you.   Do whatever you think is fun and inspires you. If you like it show it to us. You have good taste. I trust you
We are welcoming you with open arms.  Just know to bring your fancy shoes, they are welcome here too!!!  👠
Hello from San Antonio!!🥳🥳
I loved this raw vlog! And I hope you and James find happiness in Texas !
Ii knew it was Texas!  You’ll love it!
Love this type of video
love this type of blog with you
I LOOOOOVE vlog Tati!!! Please continue this kind of content! Also I’m so jealous of your move, I have had the call to Texas for awhile and my hubby is not sold yet
Okay can we do an in depth step by step of the makeup you did. Oh my GOODNESS, STUNNING
That's what I love about moving across country. Is having those big movers pack and then move you. When you're moving state to state or kind of close. You don't get the bigger carriers that you can trust. You have to find smaller ones and I'm always too scared so we wind up doing it ourself. That's why I love a long distance move. I can't wait I can't wait to move back to florida. Soon as my son graduates the countdown is on. Bring me back those ionized air sandy beaches. I can't wait to go diving. WeeeeeeEeeee
Yay Texas! Welcome ❤
Sorry read the comments cuz I just had to know but so glad you’re going to Texas I ❤️ Texas it’s my home away from home and will be definitely moving back soon 🤩
Wish you well, Texas is one of the actual last places in the US I would ever consider moving given the insanity going on with the local laws.
I loved this video. It was great to see behind the scenes and for you to juat chat to us about your day, how your feeling etc, love it ❤ Please do vlog again 😊
Awww welcome home!
Good luck and safe travels. Do videos that feel natural, your creativity will lead you.
This is so exciting 🥲❣️
i could watch your vlogs every day X
I known things are chaotic but take a moment to breathe... Stop to enjoy the second, the second that your life is changing FOREVER. For the BETTER! Don't take any of it to seriously. Congratulations!!
I live in Texas born and raised. It’s awesome but I’m biased 🤪
Moving is hard I can relate
Tati! Are we going to get more hubby and you doing unboxings?
Welcome to the midwest, If you need some friends come to Kansas City and we'll get you some amazing BBQ and Royals!!
LOVE the vlog! Can't wait to see  which city you're in. We were in Texas for 7 years and it was amazing! You will love it
I loved it. Love you Tati
I’d like to see some clothing hauls

I live in Austin!! Welcome to Texas, Tati!
I am so excited! Welcome welcome welcome to Texas!
I love the vlog!
Wow so kool to hear that Tati! I’m about 30 miles south of San Antonio , Tx (on the outskirts)… so you can ask me ANYTHING about ANYTHING here in Texas! I got ya girly 😌 Food places, best bar b Que, Mexican food, hang out restaurants… ask away 🥳 Also the sq ft per home build here is quite good. We had our home built a couple years ago for under $216,000.00  , 4 bedroom 2400 sq ft ☺️ Love that you’re going to enjoy some MUCH NEEDED SUNSHINE ☀️! God bless and may he give you all a safe journey . And remember , you have friends out here no matter what 🥰

Oh my goodness!!! I am in Dallas! If you need a Texas friend, I am here for you girl!!
Tati we are here for this content too! I love it!! You know the success of TikTok? Is because is more real people talking about real life!! Not this elaborated images of perfection!
I’m so sorry breaded with Tati cam. Love it.
I'm a Texas girl born and raised. And your personality is going to fit down here perfectly! You are a true southernbelle at heart❤
Happy for you Tati! The best is yet to come… Congratulations on your move and new beginning.❤️🌸💕
It's your channel, post what you want but I like this vlog Tati!
Seattle has turned into such a hell hole. Enjoy Texas. I lived in Dallas for 3 months. It was so fun
Would love to see a decor video on how you select furniture and paint and your picks in general
I really like videos like this. It's always nice to see behind the scenes.   I wish you & James all the best on your newest adventure! 😊
Loved this!!! Best wishes on your new journey and safe travels!

I like it. 🥰
Texas!!! You go girl!!!!💋💋💋💋
Day 68 of thanking Tati for the video 💙🌟
Puca's "Yeehaw"! 😂
I had a strong feeling it was Texas. Haha I just moved out of Texas for many reasons, but I hope you’re prepared for the weather! You mentioned that you liked the weather there, which was a little odd to hear! I definitely think Texas will suit you guys though. 🤍
I love this!!! So excited for you!! What part of texas are you moving to? My sister and I keep thinking about moving to Dallas! We live in colorado.
Wow!!! This montage of you putting your face on was amazing!!!XOXOXO
Moved to Spring Texas from California.  Stayed 10 years and moved back to California.  Ummm good luck.
I love this style!!! I feel like we get to know the “new” you. I miss James so glad to catch a glimpse of him!
YAY!!!! Welcome to the Midwest. I’m in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
I am so happy I'm a new texting myself I moved here 6 years ago I'm on the west side in Lubbock I'm normally from Vermont and I moved here without family but we did have wonderful friends here and I have not wanted to move back to my home state cuz everyone has been so welcoming and lovely here. When you put your last video out I was guessing Arizona or Texas and it was to my surprise that you went to Texas I was thinking you were going to love Arizona with the the warmth and everything that they offer I'm so happy to have you in Texas and you are smile is so big and beautiful and genuine now and I love to see I'm glad that you're feeling better getting things back on track that must be so relieving 💜🦋
My husband and I moved from Denver to Dallas and we could not be happier! If you all are in Dallas, feel free to reach out! We love love love it here!
I was born and raised in Texas and I love it! I now live in Montana, but Texas will always be home!!!
i   love the  vlog  lol  "  why do  i want  another popsicle  lol"

I love vlogging Tati and I’m so excited for new journey. Sending love and all good vibes your way.
Woohoo! Texas!
Oh, I'm disappointed you're not coming to Nashville but TX is good too. We get to TX twice a year to see family. You're going to have an adjustment with the humidity/heat but TX is a great place so God bless you and your new home.

She seems like a Dallas gal!
Yes, I love seeing these kinds of videos! Please do more!

Born n bread in Texas ❤️. Proud Texan, we welcome you with open arms Tati! ❤️❤️❤️✌️
Hope you continue posting vlogs like these.❤❤❤
Tati, when you posted that instagram comment way back when, it resonated with my soul and I took a screenshot of it and whenever I see it in my reels it makes me happy. I can’t believe it’s coming true for you 💕 Best wishes with this next step of your life
My jaw hit the floor when you said Texas did not expect that but so happy for you , you're gonna love living here and if you ever want to visit a nice beach town I recommend Rockport Tx 😉😘
Best of luck in Texas. I think you will love it. I’m a New England gal and I went to Texas and I’m not kidding…..EVERYTHING is bigger in Texas. Texas men are so friggin good looking. I hope you vlog your house and decorating. I’m so here for the Tati Lifestyle Vlog!!!
Love everything you do and enjoy watching each and every format!!!  P.S.  I love those earrings.....where did you snatch those?
Vlogger Tati is a whole vibe 😍
I guessed right where you were moving too!! My best friend just moved there and loves it. She’s in Austin though and I’m not sure we’re you’ll be but congratulations on the big move!
Tati you look so happy, I wish you the best in your new journey. Greetings from Mexico 😄
God bless Texas. We're glad to have yall, Tati. The spirit in Texas is unlike any other state. We love our people and history.
Great video
oh Tati i'm sooooooooo happy for you 🍀good luck
My dream is to be able to say "i am just popping into target". Target came to canada and failed after 2 years and it was immediate disappointment. If I could just "pop" to target... it would be so great. In terms of your town house though... your tv room there is the size of a bedroom where Im from. So  many would love a townhome and not an apartment the size of your kitchen. Very beautiful though!
😍😍😍
Yesss! We love this, Tati! ☺️
Yes more vlogs!!!!!
Love this video! Please definitely do more videos like this 🥰
you have the nicest skin= good luck on your move =its a huge stressful job
Oh yayyyy welcome to Texas Mrs. Tati!❤ I love your channel and love finding the best buy through your recommendations. I wish you the best in your endeavors🤗 👏👏🥂
Okay so don’t ever feel badly about being private and not wanting anyone to know where you live
I loved this video and would love to see more vlogs!
more vlogs!!!
Where in Texas? Please say Dallas / Ft Worth! We can be besties! :)
Poor lil Puka has alllllll the flyaways. 😆
Felicitaciones
Welcome to Texas! Hope you love it here as much as I do.
You're a natural vlogger Tati! Loved this so much! You have a beautiful life and I love seeing it. <3
OMGGGGGGGG youre coming to Texas!!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE this style of video ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yay!!  I just felt like you were going to say Texas!  Don’t know why but I just felt it. Pray all goes well and your new chapter is full of the Lords blessings!
Yes! Love vlog style Tati!!!
I’d watch every single vlog of yours if you vlog daily🤗 Totally love love love it❤️
Hope this move helps you relax and just be you! Thanks for sharing! Best of luck to the 3 of you!
The vlogs we’ve all been waiting for.
Love, love, LOVE this vlog style of video (and any video you do)! So excited for you with this new journey in your life. All the positivity and happiness to you, dear one!
Nope I love the vlog and I love that ur coming to Texas!!! Get that last popsicle too lol
How exciting🥳
So excited for you guys! More vlogs!
I am so excited for you and James!!!!! Can’t wait to see the next vlog!!!
TEXAS! It was my first guess, but I settled on Florida. Dang, should have stuck with my first instinct.
More vlogs like this!!!! Love ❤ ❤❤❤
Welcome to Texas....I feel like I have been saying that a lot lately!! LOL
Everyone is moving to Texas! Don’t forget to vote like Texans when you get there. The politics are the reason life is so good there. 👍  Don’t turn it into the place you left by voting for your old policies. ❤️🙏Peace
Exciting Times, Texas sounds fun! 🍀Good Luck with the unpacking and move! The vlog is a lot of fun, I like it. 😃
More videos like this please Tati!  Sending lots of love, luck and happiness! Xo's
You’re going to love Texas!!!
You can do this!!! 💪 Also I can feel your anxiety so much, only 3 weeks ago I was packing up our living in Europe to move to Canada. So I can say for sure, it could be worse 😂… you could have 3 luggages and 2 carry-ons to fit all your life into 🙈.
Hi welcome to texas I have lived in dallas for over 30 years and love it . The people here are the friendlist in the world and ready to wecome all newcomers. You will love texas
I'm so excited for you! I love the blogs I can't wait to see more🙂
I just love hearing Tati talk like  I am hanging with a good friend.  No Tati its not just because you show makeup (tho it is fun to watch you play with colours) it's you and your personality and stream of consciousness talking that I tune in for.  So glad that you and James weathered the storm and got back to loving each other.  Trust me - I've been married for over 40 years... Sometimes the Storms are necessary to remind you what you are fighting for, choosing it again and wrapping yourself again in the arms of your Best Friend.  It makes marriages (and people) stronger.  Wishing you the Greatest for your new Adventures!
Love this format!!! I almost like this more and there was a splash of makeup too!!!
Packing to move is the worst , I plan on doing it one more time ( hopefully) and then done , I so want to go to Florida ( I am so done with Snow) . I wish you and James many years of Happiness in your New Home
I loved this vlog! I thought about moving to TX but moved to IN instead.
I am so happy for you!!!!! , you wanted this for so long ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I’d love more videos showing horses, gardening, cooking and dining out as well as make-up.
Welcome to Texas!!!
Tati loving this vlogging.  We are always wanting more of you to watch please do more of these.
Those are my FAVORITE Popsicles!  Welcome to the South 🥰  We hope you love it! Vlog style videos are the best! Keep them coming!
LOL, as a Texan I like you even more now. I had guessed maybe FL but TX is way better cause ... no sink holes LOLzzzzz
Omg I seriously wanted to comment on your last vid that I was getting Texas vibes for you. And I haven't even watched this yet, just read comments
Love this format! I went from wearing make up 7 days a week to once a week or less (I work from home) so I don’t find myself as interested in new make up. I have mostly been watching vlogs on YouTube for the last year so would appreciate more of these!! 25-45 mins are usually the length I enjoy. Congrats on this new chapter in life! Good luck!
i wish you and your loved ones a verder happy live in texas......
Your spider comment made me laugh. I lived in Texas for five years. Girl, you'll have way more to worry about other than spiders. The cockroaches showing up in my kitchen cabinets all the time was not fun. I didn't mind the little geckos popping up during monsoon season. The javelinas I could live without.
I knew that you would move to Texas when you said that you're moving to a place where there is a lot of sun and much more space at a cheaper price.
Welcome to Texas! ❤️
Oh my gosh Texassss🙌🏻 that’s where I’m located! I love being a Texas gal and I hope you love it just as much!!! So excited for you and James and this new chapter!
Tati, I am truly so excited for you and James.I loved this video because you made me feel like I was part of your journey and family. I pray for continued success and happiness.  I really love the person you have become...... yourself. I know you and James will do great and praying for success on starting your family. You two will be great parents because you have so much love to give. Thank you for the makeup tips I have gotten from you and your friendship too. Love you girl
Yes I would love to see more vlogs like this on your move, your new home, the new area that you are moving to. I love home and garden too in addition to self care.
When you said you were moving, I just knew it would be to Texas!! Welcome to the lone star state!
More vlogs, please! :)  good luck with your move, Texas sounds great, do share more about new discoveries there. It is a pleasure watching your content, makeup or not 😄
I loved this vlog!
🌺Wonderful news! Cheers to your fresh start and new home.  Love and blessings from Maui🌺🤸🏽💕✨
I am so here for more Tati vlogs! Excited to follow you into your new chapter ❤️
From the Home Depot clip I was like "damn they'd be the hottest couple in Texas" and then bam that's where you're going 🤣🤣🤣 Good luck on your adventure!!
Woo Texas!!! 🥳🥳 #closertoTati 💜💜💜💜💜
Thank you Tati for allowing us to see this!! I love it.
You should do more vlogs I think a lot of us are tired from beauty community.
I was really hoping you were going to say you were moving to Walla Walla. LMAO! Congratulations love, wishing you all the best in life and tons of sticky dust. Endometriosis and infertility are 2 things I am all too familiar with and my heart just breaks for anyone who, like myself, just can't have the one thing in life that we would literally give anything to have. We're not okay. It's not okay. It's heart shattering. But it's tolerable when we don't feel so alone. Because let's be real, infertility is lonely. It's alienating. Especially after 30 when everyone around you seems to have kids. Worse even when they have kids, know about your diagnosis and then complain about their kids. THAT last part is the worst. But you're not alone, Tati. Neither is anyone else here reading this who can relate. Sending love and sticky dust to all.
Excited for you!!! We’re also moving to a new state!!!! Can’t wait for more vlogs!!!❤️❤️❤️
Loved this!
Welcome to Texas!  What part of Texas?  If it’s Houston, you will have many places to wear your shoes lol!
Omg 😱 a blog? From Tati? Unheard of! Love it
I knew it!!!  I'm from Texas!  You're going to love it.  Most are super friendly, so I'm sure y'all will have plenty of friends in no time!
Love❤ that your sharing all this with us!  More please!:))
I just moved to Texas a year ago from Idaho and it was the best decision of my life! Welcome to Texas! So excited for you!
I moved from Germany to Texas over the past month, so I feel you on moving. We are having to stay in an apartment until our house is finished being built later this year. The weather is so much nicer here though. Warm and sunny. Where I was living in Germany it stayed overcast, rainy, and cold most of the year so I love being in Texas so much more.
More of this! Loved loved loved this video!
I love allllll your videos 💗💗💗
A big TX Howdy from Houston! So excited for you!!💙🤍❤️ You will LOVE it here!! Congrats!!
Love love love you vlogging!! 🥰💖
I love the vlog!! Please keep doing them.
You look great Tati - with or without a stitch of makeup!!  So excited for your move & look forward to taking the journey with you ♥
I love the vlog, more please💜💜💜
I 100% LOVE this content!!!
💕➰💕 LOVE the 8mm intro!!! May Jesus BLESS your move in more ways than you can imagine now 🙏🏻 💕➰💕
We're here for you. No matter what that journey looks like. Thank you for bringing us along 🙏
I knew it!😊❤️I totally guessed right Tati. I think you will absolutely love Texas!
Hopefully you are moving to the Hill Country, this is the most BEAUTIFUL place in Texas with tons of land. My whole family lives there but I was raised in Dallas area.
Just a quick note - I'm so happy you're back.  I've been enjoying your content every week!
LOVED this vlog!! ❤️❤️❤️
Depending on where you move in Texas you can reach out to coffeebreak with Dani. She’s awesome.   I think you’d like her
So happy for you Tati! Love you and your videos so much! ☺️🥰🥳❤️💯
Congrats,  I love texas, wish I was moving too. All the best!
Texas gal 🙌🏻
I just knew it was gonna be Texas before even clicking on the video!!! Congrats!!!! I’ve lived in TX for 17 yrs; you’ll find it easy to make a home here❤️
So very excited for you both! Have fun with your new adventure! I’m looking forward to see all that you want to share with all of us!🥰
Now you need a video “makeup you need when you’re packing your whole house and moving” lol welcome to Texas Tati!
Yay!!! You’re in my home state! You’re going to love Texas Tati ♥️♥️♥️
It’s good that you didn’t show it while you were living there incase stalkers/criminals can remember your floor plan. Much love Tati!! from NZ 💓
We love it all.😍🤩
Aww Tati good luck with the move! I hope it all goes smoothly and nothing is lost or damaged or otherwise compromised. I think you're so courageous, moving to a new state where you don't have a social 'safety net' of people - that's honestly my dream, but I am afraid, lol. Thank you for sharing this part of your journey with us. I love your vlogs :-)
Texas?!!! Lucky!!!
Love love love, this content 🥰
Congratulations Tati... I am SO happy for you, your move is going to be awesome!! I am really, really looking forward to seeing everything about your move, your new place, your new life. Moving is a lot of work, but such an adventure. I moved from Canada to Italy without family or friends... and it was the most exciting thing that I have ever done... then moved back from Italy to Canada but still in a city that I had no family or friends... me and my husband. We loved the adventure, now we have settled down and been in Calgary AB Canada for more than 10 years and still without family here, but now we have friends and have made our place here. It's fantastic!! I wish the same for you... a new adventure... a new life... you deserve all the best! Love you so much Tati!! xXx
We live seeing you do makeup but this is what we wanted to see!💜💜💜 just you! Love this & love you & so excited for you & sending y'all hugs & prayers.
Welcome to Texas!  Y’all will love it here ❤️
Welcome to Texas!  We're happy to have you here.
Left LA last year to move to Texas… never looked back!
Really enjoyed the vlog, looking forword to more of these videoes 💕💕
I hope it's Austin!
Welcome to Texas!!
Love this vlog series! ❤️
Yes, Tati! It’s so courageous of you to make such a big change in a push to enrich your life. I hope things only get better for your family, and I wish you every happiness in your new home 💜
Yay Texas! Make sure to stop by Buc-cee’s!!
I LOVE VLOG TATI! ♥️ Please don’t ever feel like you can’t try new things ♥️ You are strong.
Oh Tati, what a wonderful vlog you had.  I truly enjoyed it.  You are so amazing!  I always love watching you do your makeup.  I wish you the best on your move.  God bless you.

Appreciate this blog. I have always liked your content, but this you more approachable. Having just moved away from my whole family, I can understand your emotions. It feels good to start from scratch again.
Oh, your sweet piano. Such humidity changes. She will need a few months to adjust.
I am so glad you’re moving to Texas. Get ready for the HEAT 🥵

I love this. And so excited for y’all to make a move to Texas!    If you are near San Antonio, you should check out the fiesta in April! The food, the culture, all of it is something to see and experience, even if it’s just one time.
I feel like tati would fit perfectly in nyc but it’s really expensive and I feel like she didn’t want to b a city girl no more

Seeing you with Pucka made me sad but in a good way. My Lhasa Apso just passed away 2 weeks ago and Pucka reminded me of her.  Good luck on your journey. I’ll be right here with you.
Loooooooovvvveeee this video! More please! Good luck on the move and congrats on the new house! Love you Tati!!!!
1000% you need to do makeup must haves that you kept and didn't ship. So many times people always think they know what their must haves will be, but when the times comes it's different. I would love to see what you kept.
Welcome neighbor! 🤠
I love you Tati!💜 I'm not a fan of influencer vlogs. However I don't mind yours so long as they're not pointless. I'd rather watch something productive than watch a video about your favorite Starbucks order or that kind of stuff. I guess what I'm saying is I liked this vlog where you were on a mission. Those I would watch.
I knew it !!! Texas is going to be so good for enjoy enjoy enjoy
Welcome to the wonderful world of home renovating! We've been in our place for one year and so far we've: replaced the unsafe circuit boards, redecorated a spare bedroom, rewired and redecorated the dining room, completely renovated the garden (we are doing a veg patch this year!) and found numerous other issues that have needed sorting along the way. This year's big project is the roof, which needs repairing and we're looking into solar panels because energy prices in the UK are insane right now and it's a south facing roof. Have fun and happy moving!!!
You should have privacy. Separate your work life from your private.
Funnily enough me and my boyfriend were putting a list of places that we'd like to move to at some point and right now Texas is our top place haha it took some convincing but Texas does look beautiful.
I am so excited you’re coming to Texas!!! Welcome!!
I’m from Southern California and moved to Texas. It’s a great place to live but it is not for everyone. There is a specific culture, that I love an appreciate in Texas, and I hope you embrace it. A lot of native Texans are upset about the influx of West Coast people moving to Texas because instead of integrating into the culture, as one should when they move to a new place, they try to impose their culture on the place/people. I sincerely hope that you both love, embrace, and support the Texan culture. 💚🌻
I think you'll like it in Texas! I'm in Dallas.
WoW I was so wrong in my guess! I thought Arizona or Vegas! Good on you! Enjoy your new adventure and God speed!
Congrats on moving! Loved the vlog! I love seeing this side of your life! Texas is lucky to have you!
Love this blog. Yes please keep doing. Congrats on your move! But yes, moving SUCKS! I’m just so glad you & James are doing it together! ❤️ Can’t wait to see your new digs. Texas is awesome. I know you will love it there. Can’t wait to see what city you’re moving to. And yes girl, the food is to die for in Texas! My son also loves the Outshine popsicles. I think his favorite are the lime flavored ones. Take care, be safe, and hope to see you again very soon! Hugs, Brenda

Welcome to Texas! That was my first guess when you announced you were moving!!  ❤️Texas
Welcome to Texas!!!!
I also moved to Texas from Rhode Island not knowing anyone at all but it was the best thing I did. I love you tati!!
I enjoyed this! Please do a part 2 and pls keep vlogging through your journey! I like these types of video!
Last week I saw the Tati Beverly Hills bride episode. You've changed so much.
Hope to see you in Houston! Best most authentic foods in the country. Love it here. 💕
I'm so excited for you to be in Texas!! Sending you a big ol' Texas Howdy! If you lived in my town I would definitely become your best friend! ❤️ I hope you are enjoying it here so far!
I thought u were moving to Miami
Pukas yeehaw took me out 🤦🏻‍♀️🤣
What?! Tati is moving to my state? That’s awesome.
Yes!!!!! Really enjoyed it. Can't wait to see your new place, Texas is a great state!
Welcome to Texas!! Born and raised in Texas. When I started watching this blog I thought to myself, “I bet they’re moving to Texas.” And I was right!! Excited for y’all!!
I am 100% here for moving and house content!! 💕
I really hope you find your ring Tati! ✨
Texas!!!!!!!!!!!!! Finally, normal people! You will love it. Lots of churches in Texas. Hope you find a really good one to attend. They are mega down there because, hey, Texas doesn't do small. I love your vlog. It gets you out and moving and we love it. We get to see you doing something besides caking makeup on your face. At 2am you look pretty darn good. I've moved and you think you will never be at the other end of it but you just keep on tottin' those boxes and packing. Excellent! Love ya Tati.
I honestly enjoyed more this video than the makeup related ones 💖
Texas is awesome!!! Just remember to not bring CA or WA policies with you - it’s a great state due to our conservative views/policies
Texas gal BORN AND RAISED!!!!!! WE SOOOOO WELCOME YOU AND YOUR FAM HERE! Yay! 💕
Yay!  From a Seattle to Texas transplant, love it!  And, I really love this vlog style of videos. ❤️. Would enjoy more.
Loved this Vlog - yes please do more!  I envy your move, I too am here is Washington and would LOVE to get out of this rain!  Can't wait to see what fun stuff life brings for you!
People in Texas are much more friendly than folks in LA.
I knew it would be Texas! I hope this is the best chapter of your life!
Amazing vlog! Love your makeup vids too but this format is awesome! Keep it up! Also good luck in the move! My sister went to school in Seattle and no joke the day we left to move her back it was the sunniest day from the entire time she was there so I get the need for better weather. I live in Florida and am so happy with the weather.
I think all of us changed so much during the pandemic. So seeing this kind of content in the mix with the make up would be good! It's a perfect shift.
Yes!!!! We need more of this!!!! 💕💕
Loving this video! We need more vlogs
Tati, I am so happy for you and James. Bring on ALL kinds of videos. I love seeing what you are up to!  Texas you will love. It’s beautiful country. I have to ask, why did you decide on Texas. The weather is certainly warmer than Washington and has more sunny skies for sure!  Was it more land that you wanted?  Please fill us in!  I can’t wait to see your next journey. It’s going to be a great new chapter in yours and James life!!! Yippee
You go girl!
Take us with you in this journey Tati ❤️ please we need part 2,3,4 and more!
loved loved loved!!!
Tati, happiness looks good on you💜
I’m really loving the Vlog style!!!
LOVED THIS VLOG!!! Congratulations on your move!!!!!
I did a "reboot" at age 48.  Moved across the country only knowing my husband.  It is scary, exciting and spiritual.  YES part 2 part 3 part 4....  James where are you? Oh and if you need to send your PR to someone until you are settled, I am here for you!
You should do this more often, I really enjoy it
Love this Tati! Thank you for sharing your life with us! I’m excited for you!!
So glad you are sorting out your life after all that hard stuff you went through, Tati. Texas sounds exciting, but I'm a bit bummed out you didn't say Hawaii. I guess that's my dream destination 😆
Oh how wonderful 🦋Texas sounds so good..this is inspiring I have to find a bigger place I live with boxes I can't unpack 🙏🏻 Blessings to James too   we miss your beautiful & happy face.
Yeah do this again!!! I’d love to see the new home remodeling!! Woohoo!!
I guessed Texas! Yay!
Texas is a great place.  That would be one of the states if we moved again we would think about.
Moving is stressful.  Get some rest!
I am so happy for you 😊💕 More Space? Our appartement fits in your kitchen 🤣
WELCOME TO TEXAS!!!! Don’t forget to stop at Buccees!!!!!!! 🤠🤠🤠🤠

Tati, I love your vlogs. I love seeing puka! I am so so excited for you! I too just moved to Texas from LA and it’s been a bit different but I’m sure you’ll love it. I adore you and I’m SO happy that we’re both going to be in Texas and both came from LA! Well you Seattle but LA too. 🤍🤍 May our lord provide new amazing things in our journey Tati! 🤍
Congrats on your move! Please vote in Texas to support women's rights!
Love vlogs! Please do more!
Yes! We love love the vlogs! ❤❤❤
we want more Tati!! vlogs, makeup, lifestyle, new house things... :):):) <3
I loved this vlog! I hope you do more.
Coming from Hawaii, majority of the people would never put their shoes in their closet. Clean clothes... used shoes.. no thank you😄. But living in LA, i see that almost everyone does it. No, no thank you.. Seperate shoe closet/shelving area for me.. Same goes for the laundry hamper. Far far away from clean smelling clothes. 🤣  I just cant wait to see you finally happy and able to breathe💜💜💜
I really hope you find your ring someday! Also, please tell James we said hello! So happy for you guys!
Welcome to Texas! We are so excited to have you & I hope you are showered with love!
I love it! More videos of your journey!
Welcome to the great state of Texas!! I was hoping you were moving here! I've called this wonderful place my home my whole life and we are glad to have you
Tati, words cannot describe how amazing it is to see you happy again. I’ve been watching on and off since around 2015, and I really feel like, minus the Hollywood portion, my life has mirrored yours in so many similar ways in terms of challenge after challenge. Late last year, I moved to a completely different city. Never thought I would do something like that in a million years, but my life also reached a point of feeling helpless, hopeless, and stuck. The opportunity came and I jumped. There have still been challenges, as there always are, but I’m so much happier and grateful for every single day. I’m so glad that you’ve also made the leap towards a more authentic and peaceful future for YOU (and James). Cannot tell you how inspiring it is to see you both embrace what it means to be a fully committed, supportive couple. Such a rare thing these days. Wishing you both so much happiness and continued success. So excited to follow your journey! LOVE the vlog format, btw.
I’m so happy for you!  Much love ❤️
Yes vloggggggggg
Welcome to Texas you will love it I'm from El Paso, Texas!!

Been a follower since the beginning absolutely love this type of content keep doing it!
Im so happy for you & james. I love how this vlog turned out, would love to see more content like this. Blessings on your new begining🙏🏼
Oh gees. I moved and my beauty set up is still not unpacked. I had 3 huge makeup bags from target that held: my daily go to essentials mostly skincare, my selection of my makeup and some brushes,  hair nails jewelry. I transferred so many pans to 10 giant magnetic palettes in preparation for the move but goodness.
Hi Tati just wanna say as someone who also moved to Texas away from family and leaving everything I knew behind it can be terrifying but honestly it was one of my best choices. I sold my little 2 bed 2 bath little home in Las Vegas and bought a 4 bed 2 bath here in Texas and to say that I've been blessed is the best way to put it. I'm expanding my family and reaching new horizons everyday. ☺️ I hope that this big change also brings u happiness and clarity to u and ur family as it's done mine😁 ....so to new horizons 🌄
I loooove this vlog and can’t wait to see more ❤️
Did you go lighter? I love the hair color 😍
Hoping to get a vlog of you putting the new studio together. Loved this video
Texas!!! That’s where I’m from and my home state! ❤️❤️❤️ Best of luck always, safe travels and much love!!!
Where in Texas Tati? Hope it's not Houston!
Omg!!! Im screaming!!!! Texas!!!! So happy you going to be somewhere close to me😍 my Texas…. Enjoy!!!!
I'm so happy for you!!! Sending love and blessings 🙌🏻 🙏🏻 ❤️  I can not wait to see what's to come xo
So happy for you and James! When do we get to see him again? The dynamic the two of you have on camera is wonderful, and JAMES.............we miss you! Much love to you both! God bless!
As a Texas girl born and raised, I’m so happy to hear that you’re moving here! Your sweet and positive personality will fit in perfectly and I hope your new hometown shows you the most southern hospitality! Wishing you a safe journey and a blessed new home!
If you are moving to Houston area, I will be happy to help you.  I am a real estate agent here. Adriana Lima Realtor
You're gorgeous with and without makeup lord ♡♡
I love the vlog! Keep makeup and fashion too just mix things up. Fashion Tuesday? Makeup Thursday? Stay home with me Saturday?    Love you Tati!
I need all the vlogs!
I KNEW it! I was thinking Texas when you announced the move. Beat wishes.
hope it went smoothly!!!!
Hey, Texas woman here. Welcome to my home state.
Blessings to you guys as you go through this transition! Praying that you find friends and a wonderful church in Texas.
LOVE the vlog! Keep it up!! Thx! ❤️❤️❤️
Love the vlogs
Love love this Tati. Yesssss can’t wait for more
I'm excited for your new journey! But I'm jealous with the people in Texas because you're moving there. Tbh, I was hoping you would move to Virginia because who knows if I might run into my most favorite YouTube beauty guru of all time? Wish you all the luck with moving and send you lots of love and good vibes ❤️
more vlogs please
We love this🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Texas is pretty awesome girl! Big changes. It will be so much fun! 💜
Congratulations on move to Texas.  I pray that what attracted you to Texas doesn’t change.
I knew you were gonna say Texas!! I think it’s a great place to settle down and raise kids
Love this type of video! Congratulations on everything! 💕
IM IN TEXAS! WE CAN BE FRIENDS! ;) no but really, depending on where in TX you will love it here. Good luck with everything <3
Good Luck, this was a great video
Keep it coming, we love spending time with you!
Vlogs! 🙌 Hope this new chapter of your lives will be the most amazing of them all!🤞for you! 🙌♥️
I need a tutorial on your every day makeup!
I love this…more please!!
Texas !!! That’s where I live!!!!! ❤️ Super fun vlog!
Omggg yaaaaas vlogggg 🙌🏼😊
Yay you are going to love Texas 😍
More more!  You'll love Texas!  Moved here in 2004.    Won't be Leaving ever!   Blessings to this next Chapter!    Yay!
Totally down with going on this journey with you to Texas. I think it's absolutely 1,000% a great idea. You won't be lonely without your family or your friends cuz you have your husband James, and this is going to give you both maybe time that you guys really need to just be the two of you and there's nothing wrong with that. I've been married to Scott for 18 years and 99.9% of it has been just him and I, I have a grown daughter 29 years old who obviously has her own life and I'm very content because Scott is my best friend he is all I need for friends cuz I know that he is a true friend and he's been my best friend since I'm 14 years old and that's a long time!!
Yes!!!’ Welcome to Texas lady. I relocated years ago from Cali and it’s been a journey wishing u and ur family many blessings
Love the vlog video and welcome to Texas 🙂❤
Yayyyn new beginnings! Here’s to a lifetime of happiness and good health in your new home 😎 Also MORE PUKA PLEASE 😌🙏
I love this new chapter!!! New Tati!   ❤️❤️❤️
More vlogs. Take care Tati ❤
Congratulations Tati and James on your new chapter in your life, sounds like you both need it after everything you’ve been through, I’d love for you to start vlogging more, for me, those are the best videos when someone vlogs, I almost feel like I’m there with you, Puka is such a cute little fur baby, he reminds me of my little one that sadly crossed the rainbow 🌈 bridge but never forgotten, I’m so sorry you couldn’t find your wedding ring when packing things up, I know how much it meant to you both, maybe it will turn up somewhere when you least expect it, fingers crossed 🤞🏻. Wishing You and James Much Happiness and Love ❤️ starting your life together in a new city, it will be Great for you both. Blessings from Queensland Australia 🇦🇺💖💙🐶
Welcome to TEXAS!!!! So glad to have y'all! I hope you enjoy everything about our state. We welcome anyone here as long as they don't try and change anything. We love everything as it is :) Wishing you and James the best!!
Tati I was emotional watching this. Fresh start! So excited for you. You got this xxxxxxxx
OMG, I never knew how much I’d enjoy a Tati Vlog—- more please!!!!!

So happy for you Tati!  Love these vlogs and you definitely should keep doing these 😁😁😁
How fun! Actually, it's not. Moving can be hell. Looking forward to you taking us along for this adventure.
Love love love this style of Tati content!!!
Tati!  I love your vlog videos and of course you are the master of make up videos!.  I want to encourage you and James on your new journey to Texas.  I pray you find so much peace and happiness there.  I became at widow at age 50.  My high school sweetheart and husband of 30 yrs. died in a plane crash in 2009.  I lived in Las Vegas and we owned a car dealership.  When he passed away I sold our business and moved to Franklin, TN.  I knew no one,  but I found it to be friendly, have good churches and beautiful.  It was the best decision i ever made.  I love it here and have so many friends and a great friends.  God bless you both as you start a new life.  Thanks for all your hard work and great content.  You're gonna LOVE the south.
Here for the vlogs!!!! 💜
Texas is a big state! LOL. Where in Texas?! Best of luck on your journey!!
Texas is so beautiful!!! You should definitely check out MPI Dallas church in Texas it’s a great way to surround yourself in fellowship with people who love God 💜

Welcome to the South, Tati! You are going to love it here.
Love this! And love TX!!!
I am not the only one when I say I would LOVE to see more vlogs from you Tati. Hope you have a great move!! 🥰💖
TX was one of the options in my head where you can move when you said you need sun. First I thought it’s going to be FL and then TX😅 what part of TX? We lived there before and loved it! Enjoy your new place💖
Loved this ❤️❤️
Yes! More vlogs, we love it!!
I knew it!!! I knew you were gonna say Texas!!  I loved the vlog. But I love vlog videos. I love  getting more of a glimpse at who you are as a person more so than what I see during the get ready with me videos. I know you guys have been through so much and James may be over the whole (being on video thing) but I sure miss him. So I know you are probably feeling displaced right now but girl, just enjoy the journey. It’ll be so rewarding when looking back at this chapter in life. Love ya.
Omgsh I’m so excited for y’all! Texas is awesome! You were literally the very 1st MUA I ever started watching on YouTube! I’m so happy for you and this fresh start, it’s well deserved! Prayers for y’all on this new adventure ❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Yes please part two!!
We LOVE the vlogs!

Yes yes yessss we want more vlogs yes 🙌😍 I'm so happy and excited for you 💖 I hope and I send you all my blessings to have a wonderful new life and all your dreams come true ❤ LOVE FROM GREECE 🇬🇷 MY BEAUTIFUL TATI ❤❤
There have been so many people moving to Texas it’s really changed the real estate market. I hope politics change as well as Texas is entirely to conservative and restrictive. Change is good.
We love this Tati. Yea
I love vlogs more than just make up videos but I like a mix up of them too
If by some chance you’re moving to Austin Texas go to Terry Blacks bbq it’s SO good!!
Loved this! cant wait to see more of these vlogs! You're Rocking those hills at Home Depot! Love it! 😁 👠 ❤️
So fun! Love the vlogs🥰
I’ve been praying for months to move to Texas! California is just not it for me. So happy for you guys!
More vlogs please! Super nice! 🥰
Hi fingers crossed you found your wedding ring in the drawers good luck with the move xx
Pleaaaaaaaaase more vlogs!
Yes!!! More Tati! I love the vlog
I freakin knew they were moving to Texas!!!  Welcome, from a fellow Texan!!!!  Lol 😁😁😁
I think I would have been done packing way before you even began….but that’s just me. I need time and need to be prepared in advance.
This is actually the first Tati video I’ve watched in over a month. I’m super glad she’s back but all makeup gets boring for me - but this content? I’m here for!!
Oh YES!! I looooooooooooooooove this vlog and would love more please darling Tati.  Our darling Poka encouraging you was so adorable <3  I love the makeup videos but I believe you would be so good at vlogging and why not?! Do it, you strong lady.  I pray and know in my heart that this move would be so good for you, James, and Poka.  A new begging and you will start playing your piano again as your surrounding is so important. I love how that foundation looked considering how much you did!! Good luck <3 X
I certainly enjoyed this vlog style from you, Tati and I found myself re-visiting my life through it. I have moved MANY times to new areas with no friends, family or knowings about anything. My husband is military so I have spent my adult life raising children in new states every few years . The packing you were dreading, I’m all too familiar. I know it’s not something you want to hear in the midst, but enjoy the journey and all the ups and downs because you will look back in awe of what you were able to accomplish. Welcome to Texas! You have friends here. I love to see you sharing your life. It’s so refreshing. I have watched you for almost your entire career on YT and enjoy your channel so much. If you need a friend, reach out to me!
I am so happy for you all. Texas is a great state. Grew up there and some of my family still lives there. Me and my hubby have never lived close to family or friends.
I went from Texas to Seattle back to Texas! Excited for you to live your best life here in Texas.
I'm always confused when people are excited about moving here to Texas. The heat!!! 😂 But people are friendly. You'll meet people in no time!
OK, this is crazy. I knew you were going to be moving to Texas! I have no idea why but I thought to myself as soon as I heard you say you were leaving Washington state, “I bet she’s moving to Texas.” I pray you find an amazing community there of people who can support you in your transition and encourage you in your walk with God. New chapters can be scary, but you know you are not going alone as the Lord has gone before you. Enjoy the journey!
SO HAPPY FOR YOU. Hope you absolutely love it!! I have a feeling it'll be perfect. Love you and wishing you the best!
The vlogging is it!!! Please keep doing vlogs.
You stopped and actually did a make up tutorial so I’m totally totally happy with the vlogs!! Can’t wait to see the new home
Bro I grew up in wa, but was born in Cali and now I live in TX and I literally have never run into Tati and we have been so close so many times! This is kinda crazy maybe we’ll finally meet
Yay!!! Welcome to Texas🇨🇱 so excited for this next chapter for you! ❤️
I’m from U.K. and visited Texas many years ago, it was surreal ❤️ loved Texas, many congratulations on your move , wishing you every happiness there ❤️
Yesss love these.. keep them coming. This is the same dream I have as well, so I can imagine the joy your feeling at this moment. I can’t wait to hopefully see your new home 🥰
Welcome to Texas Tati!!!!
Can we have an unboxing video with James in the new home??? Love to see him in your videos. 😘
Hey girl.  I live in Texas if you are in the Houston area ...
I like this king of content. I don’t envy packing but happy you’ve found a place you will have more room in. Best wishes!
Oh my gooood!!! I always hoped for this kind of videos from Tati. I could see she was not confortable to share more of her life. I hoped she would be in a maybe better place someday to do it. She is such a beautiful soul and it gives me so much joy to watch her videos and find out more about her and her life. 🤗🤗🤗
Welcome to Texas!!! 😁😁🐎
So happy for you to move to Texas, this is going to be good for y’all.
Welcome to Texas! I hope y’all love it here!
Loved this video. Not to dim your growth over the years but this felt so nostalgic. 🥰
Part 2 . This was the best format ever! Hugs and prayers for safety, peace and joy!!
honestly i thought you were moving to Hawaii :) thank you, Tati for sharing, vloging suits you :)
I am so looking forward to the future vlogs! This will be wonderful for both of you and I am excited to see your new adventures.

I enjoyed the vlog. Congratulations and good luck on the move. Also, it was good to see/hear James again.
I WAS PRAYING YOUD SAY TEXAS IM SO HAPPY 😭😭😭😭
I have to say I love vlogging Tati. Especially the part of Tati and Puca playing. Welcome to Texas!
Hope the move went well I am so happy for you both 💗 I loved this vlog can we have more please ❤ ♥ 😊 xx
I lost my wedding ring for 6 months. I put it somewhere safe during a track day so I wouldn’t lose it and ended up losing it. I found it in my glovebox maybe that helps 😂
Earlier when you said you were moving I thought “TEXAS!” I’m tickled you are in this new adventure! And selfishly, if you are in Texas, I might get a chance to see you in person since I’m close to Texas. Of course it’s a huge state. 😃
YAY I’m in Texas can’t wait to where and hope you love it as much as we do!!!
I JUST moved back to Seattle area because I hated Texas. I hope it works out better for you!
Congratulations Tati!  Woo-hoo TX!!! Like this kind of video, please keep it up along with the makeup videos of course 😉
I’m sooo happy for you guys!! Texas is beautiful!!! Great place for. NEW START!!! 😘😘😘

Tati, it is so amazing to see you so happy. It is a different kind of happiness than I have ever seen on you. You just seem so at peace with where you and James and Puka are. It is really rad to see! I'm so happy for you and wish you all the best on your new journey! <3
I really hope you vlog. I think you would be great at it.
I was guessing Texas (Austin or Houston). Or Nashville TN. Since that’s where everyone is moving these days. LOL. I would love to live in Texas. It’s one of the most favorite places we’ve ever visited.  Love the vlogs!
This was fun Tati! So into lifestyle and vlogs right now, and we still got a little makeup routine 🧡

Welcome to Texas! We moved here with similar circumstances (no friends/family), and it took a while to find them, but now it’s home.

This was very refreshing to see. You and your dog and what your going through with moving. I'm happy for you,it all seems to be going well and the right timing. If you get a horse, please show her. That sounds great to have property,a garden and be outside doing stuff. ❤🙏🌻

I literally screamed for joy when you said Texas!! I am here!!! 🤩🤩🤩 ahhh Tati!!!! I’m soooooo happy for you, I want to cry !!!! I hope I see you one day, not in a creepy fan way but a friend haha that sounded creepier 🥴😅🤣 Been here since 2014! I can say I never left!

Love the vlog style! Can’t wait for the behind the scenes. Congratulations on your move! A resting soul sure makes for better opportunities all around❤️
The best part is seeing you and James happy  and the take away is “change for something more exciting “. Love to see more vlogs like this one.

MY STATE!! You're going to LOVE IT ❤️
Love the vlogs. It feels more personal and less formal. And James' camo in the video brings all kinds of good nostalgic back-in-the-day vibes. Have fun girl. Here's to your guys' new adventure.
Texas makes sense. Idk why my brain was saying Florida when you were talking about the weather
Where in Texas? Wishing you all happiness.
LOVED THIS! We need more Tati Vlogs!!
I had unsubscribed from Tati a long time ago when I outgrew the makeup phase I was in. It wasn’t for a lack of loving Tati, but more of not being relatable. I’ve truly enjoyed Tati as a person but besides makeup talk, there wasn’t much else.   I am so incredibly glad to see THIS type of content coming from you Tati…the vlog style is much more relatable and I’m so excited to be back. You’ve grown so much and I’m looking forward to the journey!💙
You are my role model. We are in the beginning stages of our move. All so scary but exciting. Love these types of vlogs!!!! Wishing you the best 💕
Yes please on more Vlogs!!
I am sooo excited for you!!! God bless you !!!
The sigma palettes feel so expensive for target makeup... idk why my brain can't let me buy them
You’re moving to my state!!!!! So excited for you Tati!!!
5 seconds in and already loving vlog Tati! Please do more! Love your usual videos too, don’t get me wrong ♥️
SUCH CUTE EARRINGS!!! Where are they from? 🥰
Omg 😳 as a Texan and piano teacher Welcome! And wow you have a Steinway Grand!!! Majorly impressed!
I'm so exited for this new chapter in your life ❤️ I'm really glad you decided to share it with us! 💕 And I love the idea of vlogs!!!
"But I have to get to Texas..." - Tori Amos and Tati. Go Tati! It's going to be beautiful!

YEs yes yes yes yes!!! MORE VLOGS PLEEEASEEEE!!! I love theese!!!!

I had guessed  Las Vegas OPPS as the weather seems seasonal and mostly sunny.. Now makes sense that you would be able to stretch out and have the space you long for and lots of sunny weather.  Looking forward to you and James new adventures in Texas. I always love when you share Pukka with us has been great for your difficult times and love that he is the star and soon his own yard LOL Thanks
A Tati vlog?! Holy smokes! This is the type of content I’ve been wanting! (Love your normal videos of course) Just really like to see your day-to-day life! Thanks for sharing- sending blessings to you and James💜
Safe travels. Best wishes for your new chapter in life💕🙏
Yay! I'm in Texas! 20 miles from San Antonio. Be safe y'all.
I love this! ☺️💕
I LOVE this vlog! It is so cool to see a different side of you showing all of the raw and realness🤍 I am sending all of the positive and motivational vibes/prayers your way! Texas is gonna look so good on you and your fam! Sending love to you and Mr. Puka
More of THIS content please!
The vlogs are so fun! Sending love for an easy move and transition ! 💕
Love the blog process. Your so fun. Can’t wait to see the new place. You and everyone moving to Texas. So fun.
I liked this vlog do mor like this please  i have been watching you for a while. Congrats  on the move to texas i live in Oklahoma
Tatiiiiii I live in Texas. Let's be  friends 💜  you know while back I dream you live near me, and you and I were hanging out together.  It was such a cool dream.  Contact me please
Love love the vlog Tati.. good luck for a new start in Texas Tati.. loads of love ❤️

Helios means sun in Greek
WooHoo! I love the vlog! It’s nice to see you doing real life. Good luck with everything!
Looooove this content
I had a feeling you were moving to Texas! It feels so right for you 💕
As someone who also recently moved to Texas and knows (almost) nobody, welcome! Can’t wait for more vlogs :)
Puka looks so smug, I love him!
Welcome to Texas y’all!! Best state in the country! Come to Houston and say Howdy!!
yay TEXAS!
I knew it- called it on the last video! Central Texas and Austin is where it’s at… my family has a ranch in the hill country and it’s far enough away from the city to buy land, but close enough to get to a city where things are happening and an intl airport etc…
I like this type of vlog from you!  I am excited to see the next chapter!
Love love love vlogs!!!! Please do more lifestyle/vlog format videos. All positive vibes on your move!!!!
Can’t wait for you guys to go to a rodeo and check things out!
💙💙💙
I love this!!! Vlogs are great!
Yay!!! Welcome to Texas y’all!!!! 🤠
Best wishes for you guys❤
Loved the vlog! We moved to TX in October and are loving it! Can’t wait to hear which part of TX you picked!
My husband and I have moved cross country 4 times, never to a place where we knew anyone.  I have become such a minimalist because packing is such a pain.  You can do this!!!!
I just knew this was going to be the state you guys picked! Great choice! Good luck with your new lives there! <3
I hope you had that forth popsicle
Well, welcome to Texas!!! You will have so many friends in no time! People are so nice, and genuinely nice...not fake like LA.  We moved here in 2005 after losing it all in Katrina (New Orleans) , and I'm so glad we did. My house has TRIPLED in value, you won't find better Bar-B-Q,  and the Mexican food is out of this world! There's also world-class shopping ( Dallas is home to Neiman Marcus ), and so many colleges and universities. Just watch out for the "plastics". That's the women who have been nipped and tucked within an inch of their lives! Find you some loyal, down to earth friends. It seems like you're on an exciting and honest time in your life. I'm telling you...this is a great place to take that journey! God bless, Tati.
Loving this format, and love seeing behind the scenes/other parts of your life! Such a breath of fresh air, after what was a really difficult few years for you! Sending lots of love to you and your fam on this new adventure! ♥️
Love you Tati!!! Best wishes for your new journey in TX. So happy for you and James ❤❤
More vlogs please!!! ❤️❤️
Omg! Ik you will love it! I have lived here my who life, and I would never wanna live anywhere else!
I absolutely love the vlogging. Can't wait for more videos like this. 🤩
Texas? Oh gawd. Unless it is Austin? We know the sort of person who voluntarily moves to GOPland
so funny, i have lived in Tx for 35 years from L.A. County.  Obviously all of the Californians moving to Tx, Austin in particular are unaware that Austin is becoming the new L.A. and most Texans arent happy about it, lol.
Love this format 💖💖💖 keep doing it, please 👍
I definitely enjoy vlog-style
Love this! Pleas more vlogs 😍😍😍
This is the kind of content we all wanted. Please vlog more.
Need more vlogs AND more Puka! 🐶 🥰
More vlogs pls
plz plz plz more vlogs!! we love it ❤️❤️❤️
I really enjoyed your vlog, and hope you do more of them!  Good luck with the move!  I'm a native Texan and miss my homeland! I hope you find a world of happiness there!
This was fun to watch. I love learning more about your life!
HOW did you get any of that packing done with cute little Puka around
More vlogs! Love this content!
We want more! We want more! When you really like something, you want more!
Only Tati could do a full face of makeup with lashes on a moving day 😂 love it
Love how you and James flirt with each other ♥️♥️
I love you are comfortable taking us along for the ride. Have a nice move, and I'm exited to watch the next chapter of your adventure ❤️
This was such a good video!!! More like this please! I love the vlogging and getting to know more about your life! 💕💖
wow nice! I cant wait to see the new makeup room
Texas!  That's so awesome!  I wish you, James and the pupper the best of the best!  Onward & upwards, Tati!
Happy to have you here in Texas.. more souls like you are needed 😅
YAASSS here for a VLOG Tati
Please keep vloging!! I'm so excited for your new chapter. Congratulations!
I love this type of video and I’m so excited for your new adventure. I felt so productive watching this too and was able to do some cleaning. Thanks Tati!! Marlena Stell lives in Texas too, maybe you can both do a makeup getting ready video together! OG makeup gurus 🙌🏼❤️🥰 love you Tati hope many blessings continue coming your way. 🙏🏼
My family just moved to Texas last week!! We are still in Seattle, though. I'm so excited for you as you build your homestead and have a baby/babies... Go  make the best of it, Tati! God bless you!
This was soo fun, you are so funny. I hope we get more of these videos.  P.s your hair color is gorgeous 🥰
Welcome to TEXAS ☀️💕 have been here all my life and you’re so right - best food, warm weather 10 months out of the year, and so many good travel spots!
I love the vlogs!
I am so excited for you all Tati. Safe travels and many blessings on your new journey. I also moved out of my state this past year to a state with no family or friends and I am so happy I did. Will miss them but loving my new apartment in South Carolina sunshine and sea ..be well enjoy 🙏🏼
Yeah you can go on ahead and get rid of all your cold weather clothes. Keep one coat, one beanie, and one pair of boots…you’re good 😂😂😂. Never would have expected Texas but I am SO excited for you!!!!
Safe travels.  Texas is flat but otherwise beautiful and fun.
So amazing to see you slowly but surely ebbing back to your core essence which is that effervescent positivity I’ve always loved you for!  Best wishes for your move, Reno and new adventure!
Welcome to Texas!  I live south of Houston. Except for the occasional hurricane it’s a wonderful place to live.
What's your go to Starbucks order? looks good! Loved the vlog, good luck with the move!
This was awesome I’d love for you to also become a home living channel
Good Luck Tati.   You will love Texas.  Be well.  It’s positive move
I had a feeling it was Texas!!! Welcome home. 🖤
I lived in San Antonio and i loved there! I miss TX😂 you will love TX and enjoy lots of good Mexican food n barbecue
Congratulations and best wishes on your new adventure! 😃
So excited you are moving to Texas. Never would have guessed. I know you will love it.
Yes!  More vlogs!  I had a feeling it was Texas!  Good for you!  Looking forward to the new content!  God bless you and James!
Wow I really enjoyed watching this video, it was fun!  So happy for you, love you always ❤️
Best of luck - my husband and I did the same and was such an amazing reset.  Prayers your way!
Don’t do a home tour in your new place. Lots of creepy people will figure out where you live from realtor sites. Stay safe.
I’m so excited that y’all are moving to Texas ❤️❤️❤️welcome.
Your makeup is flawless!!!!!!! Good luck with your move! I wish nothing but the very best :)
Buen viaje
Definitely enjoying this kid of video. Wish you guys all the best. Enjoy!
Love it Tati! Give us more of this! 💝🥳🎉
I’m so excited that y’all will be fellow Texans! What part of Texas are you moving to? I’d love it if you were going to be in my area! (Doubtful - but close to east Texas?! 🤞🏻?? Lol)
wow well welcome to texas! you’re gonna have plenty of space lol can’t wait to see the upcoming vlogs
I’ll watch whatever you post love ya 🥰
Tati, I loved watching this part of your journey. Praying for you as you move and settle into your new space. May God grant you many blessings, and may Texas be a new, happy, and fulfilling chapter! 🙏🏻❤️
I’m so happy for you and James. Hope the move went well and that Texas is everything you want it to be, now and always.  Be well, and keep us faithful followers updated as you have time. Cheers!
This is FANTASTIC!! I would love to watch your journey to a new beginning. My mother in law just moved to Texas from Oregon. She is 99 years old. I have lived in Oregon my whole life. I just retired from working at a hospital for 43 years and my husband and I decided it was time for a change. We live in southern Oregon and are tired of forest fires every summer. We decided to move to Arizona and just like you we will be on our own with no family or friends. It’s scary but at the same time I’m ready for a new beginning.  Best of luck, your friend Romona ❤️
Congrats!! Yes for vlog!
Yay welcome to Texas!!!
Lol I got goosebumps all up and down my body when you bit down on the popsicle 😂😖😖😖😫 I can NOT do that! My daughter teases me all the time and will go “hey mom, look!!” And when I look she will take a slow bite of her popsicle and slowly chew it and it makes me so cringe because I can just feel the pain 😂
New starts are the best ✨
OMG i love that your coming to TEXAS!!!!! As a fellow texan, i know you will definitely love the weather, and all texas has to offer. 😁😁
Yeess!! Tati vlogsss perfect!
Sooooo excited for vlogging Tati. Texas is lucky to have you! ❤️

Oh i remember you mentioning you lost your wedding ring with the last move and may have accidently donated it with other jewelry... I hope with this move you were able to find it. I always thought it was the most beautiful ring. And welcome to Texas!!! That my birth state. It's lovely in the east parts of Texas.
Love the vlog style! Congrats on your new home
Oh my God.  My first guess was Hawaii. Never even considered Texas!

We like this and we are excited to see your new journey and are ready to see you happy again !
Vlogs are my favorite YouTube content, so please keep them up! I know it’ll probably take a little while for you to get comfortable in a new format, but omg, this is what I’ve been hoping you’d put out one day! Vlogs are so genuine and relatable, so thank you for taking this chance with us ( and I personally will take all the puka footage! ❤️🐶 he’s so cute!!) so happy for your move and fresh start!
Hope your move went well.
😊 HAPPY  MOVING   DAY 💚💛🧡💙💜
Tati!!! I am so happy for you and James. As a Texan born and raised, welcome! I have been watching you ever since the early days and was so excited to see you back online after your break. I'm so glad you took the time you needed, but selfishly I am so happy to watch your videos again! I would love to see more behind the scenes/vlog content. While I love the makeup content, more than anything, I just love you! So excited for your new journey in Texas and can't wait to follow along. I hope your move brings you so much joy and peace and happiness.
Yes Tati!!! This is what we need more of! New chapter = new video formats!
Reno content is my favorite ish on youtube lol. I can't wait to come along for the journey!!!!!!!!  Congrats on the move 🙌
Interesting how a lot of West Coast folk are relocating to Texas. So are Chip and Joanna Gaines doing your renno?
It’s so crazy, I literally have been thinking of you a lot lately. I recently just lost my mother-in- law and father-in-law 2 months apart and we have taken in their sweet, beautiful dog Precious❤️. I remember watching your past videos talking about the loss of your husband’s mother and how painful it was💔😢 Please keep our family (The Hailey family) in your prayers please🙏🏾   *Side note: I live in Texas and I know that you will love it here❤️❤️❤️
Good luck with it all Tati! I miss Texas terribly.
🤠 Welcome To Texas. But Tati y'all have a friend here in Texas....ME❣ No Stress it's all good 😊 Bless 🕊
Love You and would Love more vlogs of your new journey in Texas!! Sending  lots of love and blessings to You and James🥰😍😇
Hearing and seeing a glimps of James made me so emotional for y’all! I’m dumb but I’m happy to see you happy!!
I’m having flashbacks😂 January 2021 I moved across the country from Virginia to Idaho for work. Knowing no one! I was 26 single and moving alone. I was told our moving truck would come in 2 weeks… I was living out of a suitcase in a completely empty apartment for over a month. It was the greatest thing I have done in my life and the hardest. I’m a nanny so I knew 4 people in Idaho and 2 of them where under 3 years old. Over a year later and haven’t been happier though it was sooooo difficult the lead up to moving. Excited to join you on your journey!
By the time I am writing this comment you will be moved - amazing - you did it! We knew you could. Loved the blog too!
Hope you can influence the anti-woman politics in Texas! Best of luck to you🍀😎
I loved this video!!!! The not make up review Tati is awesome!
Clickbait 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
Wishing you, James and Pooka a good move and fresh start. You all been through a lot.  I hope you find your wedding ring. X
Moving away to a new place where you know nobody is very scary but it's so exciting too! It's a fresh new start like no other. Me and my husband moved away from our home state of WV twice but somehow we found our way back lol it was an adventure to say the least! Many positive vibes and enjoy this adventure!
All of these youtubers know EXACTLY why they are moving, but they won’t say it. Now don’t go eff up the good states xoxo. 💋
Got a huge burst of happiness and excitement just seeing James' shoulder and hearing his voice ❤️ hope you're doing well James!
I am obsessed with this style of video!!! Please do more!!!
I’m so excited that you’re coming to Texas Tati! You’re going to love it here! And I’d love more vlogs from you! I love watching your videos and your energy is just amazing.
Wow Texas seems to be the new hotspot everyone's moving too. Angelika just moved there too from Sweden.
Loved the vlog style!!!
More vlogs please!
YES MORE VLOGS I LOVE IT
Okay first of all, howdy neighbor! 🤠 Omg you're coming to TEXAS!!!!!!! AAAAAHHHHHHHHHH how exciting!!! Welcome to Texas Tati! I'm so excited for you ❤️❤️❤️ congratulations on the new life, new home, new beginnings, new everything! Also YESSSSS to the vlogs! Please keeps them coming 😍❤️
The suspense on the location you were moving to was killing me but I'm so thrilled for you, James, and Puka!
Texas law makes me so upset I could never move there without being in a constant state of unrest.
We will always be by your side Tati, no matter where you are💕
I'm so happy for you guys! This is a new chapter in your lives! Sending you love, positive vibes, and Good luck with everything! Thank you for sharing the news with us!!!  :-)  :-*
Love you Tati so excited for you!!!!
I knew it was texas!  That is where everyone is going. Come see me!   Im north of you in Southern Oklahoma! ❤️❤️🌸🌸 Oh PS…7-11 is my number that reminds me to stay open good things are coming.
So excited for this chapter in your life. Many blessings and I can’t wait for this type of connect. I love this ❤️
Tati, that is just Seattle's way of saying, bright skies are in your future.  I agree that moving a piano can be cringey---only piano players would understand the sentimentality of playing their own piano.  Best packing wishes and safe travels.
I bought the “mirror-of-truth” - I love it!  Shows me pores I never knew I had! 😂
Love this video ♥️♥️♥️
So happy for you that you drifted apart from all the fake beauty community and that you are in peace❤
👍 part 2! Love it.

Hi Tati! Sometimes a fresh start is the best that we can do. Meet new people. See new things. Get new motivation.
Please continue this kind of volg.
Puka shelle turns Puka Boots! 🤠
Yay! We moved from WA to TX a little over 2 years ago! We don't miss WA at all!
I love this!
Hey Tati🦋! It’s like watching my friend coming out of a low phase. I wish James made a little appearance, he’s such a wonderful human being. And from the tiny glimpse, I almost thought that he has long hair, tied back…hope you had a nice move and Texas treats you well. Looking forward to your next vlog. It suits you, please continue 😘💐🙋🏼‍♀️

I am so happy for you Tati:) horses and piano…. you take me back to my teenage  days which I loved 🥰  Have fun in texas !

God bless you and your journey.

I’m so excited for you!! Congratulations!
Welcome to Texas!!!! I love your blog so do more.
I love that you love Mexican food and moving to Texas you’ll have your fill lol don’t know if that factored into the decision lol
The fact we are trying to move in 48 hrs and putting make up on made me panic lol we don't have time to glam!! 😅
literally crying i live in TX ahhh I'm so happy for you! <3
Welcome to Texas!!!  This was the best move I NEVER thought I'd make, much less LOVE!  Moved here 15 years ago with the military, left for a couple of years on assignment and came back HOME to retire (could have literally moved anywhere in the US and lots of places worldwide).  I hope Texas brings you as much happiness and as many blessings as it has to me and my family!! ❤️
marlena from makeup geek lives in texas as well!!!
LOVE this format
Heck YES!!! TEXAS IS THE BEST!!
Totally love it 😍
Yes 👏 👏  love you and James
Wow! Texas!! Congratulations Tati! Love how genuine honest you are!! Look stunning always!! Keep us inspired💋
Wow! So exciting! Loved this video!
Im so happy i started tuning back to Tati around this time. I stopped watching for a while when the youtube debacle took place, and i lost interest if i’m being honest. But tuning in these past couple of months, Tati just looks so much brighter and more happy. Its so nice to see growth, really fills you with hope too
OMG!! Moving to Texas! Would love to see you and Angelica Nyqvist meeting and doing some makeup together 😍 All the luck in the world for the move and the new place 💖
Love this content yes to more vlogs!
I had my wedding rings stolen  by a nurse when I lost a  baby in hospital. Yes truly. However, I finally had a  baby and our marriage has lasted many years. I often wonder if she really enjoyed wearing those rings and the answer is no. I seem to recall the stone had belonged to James's mother too. Bless you both and bless your new life together in Texas.
Texas is amazing! I think you will be so happy there.
You have that glow back!!! Awesome for you
Love these vlogs! More please! I’m so excited for you guys!
Welcome to Texas!!! Texas is the best most beautiful place to live! Dallas TX welcomes you home!
Love love Love this video!! I totally thought you were going to say Hawaii! Surprised at Texas. How fun going on an adventure to this friendly and beautiful state. Prays of safe journey and happy moving. God Bless Tati!
Hello, and welcome to TEXAS!!! Now, you got me curious what part of Texas you're moving to. I'm sure you probably want to keep the exact town location private, just curious what part since it's a really big state (North? South? East? West?). I'm from South Texas here, the Coastal Bend area near Corpus Christi. Hope you enjoy your stay here in this great state, even if our weather is a bit crazy.😂
Loved it! Congratulations on the move. Hope you survived!
Good luck sweetie.... can’t wait to see your new place xx
Tati: maybe this is weird to say *mentions how she's not alone because she's bringing us with her*  Me: 😭🥰😭  Loved this video and can't wait for more like it! Xoxox

Congratulations on the move and I think Texas is a good choice.  I recently had to move from League City,  TX,  I loved it there. I pray it's all you want it to be and Puka loves it too.

Nothing like a fresh start!! We'll be neighbors, lol. I'm in NW Louisiana and have land, horses, the whole country experience. Love it. When you're settled, maybe we can plan a trail ride with your other horse riding subscribers!! Best of luck on the move ❤
Texas is beautiful country!
AHHHH TATI I'm so excitedfor this new chapter for you!!!! I've lived in Texas my whole life 🤗 I think you're going to love it here💜
STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST BEN AND JERRYS
Congrats on the big move. As someone who lives in SoCal via PNW, the "we love the weather" statement is very interesting to me. I hated the weather in TX all three times I spent time there. Some people love TX though.
Welcome to Texas!  We moved here five years ago from Southern California and could not be happier.  Live on 6 acres and it is awesome!  I grew up in San Diego and spent most of my life in California so it was crazy, but we have never looked back.
Love vlogs!!
Yesss!!! So excited for you all!! And I am totally here for vlogs!!! And love the behind the scenes every day life stuff 💁🏼‍♀️
I don’t normally comment … but this made me emotional for you. A new fresh start. May blessings overflow for you Tati. I see this is going to be so good for you & James. Thank you for taking us along. Can’t wait to see what is up for you in Texas. I pray you find new friends and family there to support you in your endeavors! This is so good!! Very excited for you! ❤️
So happy for you, Tati. Praying that you moved to McAllen, Texas so we can become friends. 🥰😃 I’m wishing you the best and sending prayers your way. ❤️🙏🏼
LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! As a military family, I know the packing struggle-bus, girl. I feel for you and send all my positive vibes. I love content like this... TATI UNFILTERED!!💜💜 All my love, gorgeous. Xoxo 😘 #doggyyeehaw #welcometotexas #gonnaneedbiggerlashes

Yes, please!
Love love love this!!!
Woot you are moving to my state.  Rockwall, TX east of Dallas.   I'm guessing somewhere outside of Austin.

My family started over moving to the Dallas area when I was a freshman in HS. It was such a necessary re-start for our family after lots of turmoil in Chicago. Best decision my parents ever made.
OMG!! We are doing the exact same thing and moving there too.
Welcome to TEXAS!!! My jaw dropped when you said it!! Prayers for safe travels and for y'all's new home!!! ❤❤❤

Hi Tati! I love the vlog style video. Where in Texas are you moving to? I moved to Houston from Ventura 11 years ago.
Gooood luck Tatiii, wish you all the best in this world!!! Can't wait for another videoooo!!🥳🥳🥳💖💖💖💖😘😘😘🤗🤗
Loved the Vlog! Hope you guys have safe travels ❤️
I wanna move with you!
Congratulations!  Happy for your move and new home!  Although I’m wondering in what universe I would put on full makeup and lashes when I’m packing to move. Lol. Wishing you all the best!
loved this <3
Yes, more vlogs!!! And good luck, you can do this!! 🥰
Yay!!! I’m soooooo happy for you and James!! I am stoked about Tati vlogs!! Please tell James we love him also and hopefully one day we will get unboxings or something with him involved ❤️
How odd and wonderful.  Like your husband  we are from NC and my baby girl has moved to Texas! She loves it so much and the food is amazing. The people are wonderful and as you know in the south you don't  meet strangers just good friends whose name you don't  know yet. James being a southern  gentleman  and the prerequisite little fluffy dog means you are in! Enjoy and maybe I can wave and say hey! If I  see you when I  visit. By the way when you get there first stop, Buc-ees! You're  gonna love it!! Congratulations  and welcome  to the south, bless your heart! 🤗🤗🤗❤
Best wishes to you guys in your move to Texas ! Love the Vlog type of videos.
I took piano lessons for years, but after I got married and had kids and then started working again full-time, I just didn't have time to play.  I made it my New Year's resolution this year, to play piano for at least 1 hour per week - split it up into multiple days or all at one time.  So far, that has worked great for me and I remember how much I loved to play!
We like it the music was very calming taking a glimpse into your life again
I love this from you!! Can’t wait to see your new digs and more vlogs! 💕💕
Obviously voting for such logs !!!  Very happy for you, good luck!  Fun to see you happy 😘
Loved this , love u!❤️
Texas welcomes y’all! I just moved to the Waco are after living in Houston. I’ve also spent time in Austin and Dallas. You’re in good hands no matter where you land because Texans are very friendly. If you’re near one of the bigger cities look for Central Market—I think the foodie in you will appreciate it. It’s owned by H‑E‑B, and it’s like Whole Foods and H‑E‑B had a baby. :)   One more Texas piece of advice: “bless your heart” is the polite way to say F$@/ you. Just in case… 🙂
it was really nice to hear james!! been missing him!
Ya'll are the newest " Jefferson  moving on up "
So happy you’re coming to Texas! Excited for your new journey
Wow this made me emotional to watch. I’m so happy for you! You’re going to love Texas 💜 oh and i loved the editing so much!

Whoa! Is EVERYONE moving to Texas?!?  Love it!
I’m so excited for You and James and your new beginnings. Congratulations on your new home. TFS😊
Not sure what part of Texas you're moving to but, you could totally hook up with Dani Austen and those girls. They seem nice and fun and I feel like you'd fit right in!
Moved to Texas 5 years ago.  Big state —hope you’re in our area.  We love it here.  My husband was originally from Texas, but I’m a California native—much happier here.
Also, this was so good.  Please more of this.
YAY...welcome to Texas.  I lived my ENTIRE life in San Jose, CA (Silicon Valley).  We moved to Central Texas 2 years ago not knowing a soul.  Love the kind people, open space and the dramatic weather change from one day to the next.  Oh, and our new home cost us 1/5 (or 20%) of what we sold our San Jose home for!
We loved this!!!!!
More vlogs like this please! Makeup, your little doggie, your home, you and your husband, garden being started, the building up of a new life/lifestyle, YOUR NEW BABY! etc. like you said it’s part of evolving/life’s chapters.
For some reason, I just had a feeling you were moving to Texas after your last video! Welcome to the area! :)
Welcome, from a lifelong Texan here!!! The beauty of Texas is we have it all, hills & country, great city life, wonderful little towns, and amazing people. So happy for you guys!!!
Make up, vlogging, fashion, home deco; WE LOVE IT ALL! 🥰 We love watching you enjoying life and feeling great! Big hugs from the Netherlands 😘
We did this in 2020! Left all our friends and family and moved to Texas. Best decision ever!!! Welcome home. (And if you need a friend in Texas, just reach out!!)
Puka made the video!! Awesome

When ,I was my early 20 I move to Maryland. My family are from California and Arizona.  I was so excited to move but honestly, there be times that you can get lonely but when you make friends you be just fine. I do love Maryland it’s very  Beautiful here. I will never want to move back to the west cost. It will take time to adjust.  Everything will be okay I promise. If you pray 🙏 and have God in your life everything is awesome. Meditation is really good to. I wish you the best of luck good move. God bless.☺️
Good luck with the move!  I like the vlog format.
Definitely looking forward to future vlogs!  You should reach out to Angelica Nyquist. She just moved to Houston in January.
Praying blessings over this move for you guys!!! God called Abraham to move so His plans would  fulfilled and he could to continue to bless Abraham. The best is yet to come!  PS love the vlog. “Variety is the spice of life” - Cowper
You definitely need your own like Hulu show of you transforming your new Texas home into your dream home 💗 I would def watch that lol
I started watching your blogs 8 years ago, and I decided to unsubscribe when all the drama started because it just felt like you were becoming a different person. I am so glad you have decided to make that change in your life, and I’m super excited to watch your journey. I just re subscribed and I really hope you decide to blog, not just about makeup but your new lifestyle. Wish you the best! 😊👍
Love the vlogging and the make up! Congratulations on your move!
i loved loved loved this so much, tati ❤️❤️❤️
You are going to LOVE Texas. As a native Texan of 34 years I am still discovering new places and things to love about this great state. The people and the food above everything are the greatest 😍🤩 Welcome home neighbors 🥰

No way! We just moved to the same state from Pennsylvania! Got sick of the gloom, and cold, so we packed up and boom. We arrived quite recently, and so far, we love it… but todays rainy and gloomy so… 🤷🏼‍♀️
Where in TX? Get ready for some crazy up and down weather but plenty of sun! The people are great too. I'm in Austin now but lived in Houston for many years. Love them both!
Love it!!  Have you prayed to St. Anthony to help you find your lost ring?  🙏🏼

I love seeing behind the scenes of your life and so excited for your family’s new journey in TX!!!!

Yesssss! Vlogs! So happy for you and love this content from you. Keep it up!
Yes more vlogs like this!!! 🤗🤗🤗
OHMYGOD IM SO EXCITED TO WATCH !!!
I had a feeling you were moving to Texas!  I obviously don’t know you “in real life” and don’t know your political views, but with your beliefs on God, I got the vibe you’re fairly conservative and LA and Seattle are SUPER woke…….(and you don’t seem super woke) so it seems like Texas would be a wonderful move for you ❤️❤️❤️
I didn’t expect Texas to be the move and I think that makes it more exciting! Congrats! Also, the Outshine bars are so good. The lime is my favorite but the grape and raspberry are a close second.
We just moved from Vancouver Wa to Dallas in Nov 2021 BEST decision ever. You will love it
Omg I can’t believe your moving here😭💖
Love this for you! I live in Texas about 30 minutes outside of Dallas. Where about will you be?
I am sure you will have a wonderful new home and experience. I am not sure I could live in Texas but I am keeping an open mind. Yes, please vlog as much as you want. It was fun.
I’m so excited for you!!! Welcome to Texas your going to love it here.
I enjoyed this vlog style.  More vlogs please.
Loved this vlog! I love vlogs in general. Good luck with the move! I'm so excited for you 😊
The other day when you said you were moving I prayed to God that you were coming to Texas!  I'll be your new best friend,  I travel all the time so no matter where you're at give me a shout and I'll come visit
YEE-HAW - Texas is becoming the new Beauty Community!!! Love it - prayers for you as you adjust to life in the Lone Star State...and WELCOME from a Native Texan!
Good luck huni can’t wait to see your new place 🥰🙏
Yay for Texas! I don't live there, but I visit it a lot and I want to move there! I think you will love it!
Omg, when you said I’m shinny , I immediately started hearing the song from Moana ‘shinnnny 🎶 ‘ 😂
Hope y’all will be so happy in Texas!
So excited to see you in the south!!! Your warm spirit will fit right in and Texans are notorious for making you feel right at home. And just think Louisiana is super close too if you ever want real Cajun food :)
YES!! Welcome to Texas!
I was hoping you’d say Texas!  Welcome!  We have great food, good music, and good people!
I'm praying for your wedding ring to return to you. Fully let it go and it'll turn up.
Many blessings in your new home!
I FREAKING LOVED THIS!!! I love unscripted Tati. Please, please keep vlogging.
Ahhhh yayyyy!  I’m born n raised in Tx. You’re going to love it here. Soo excited for you and your family. Excited for Tati vlogs.

Sending you love and prayers that the move will be successful and less stressful and hopefully your home will be ready soon. Please keep posting the vlogs, I love to see more. :)
Omg! Welcome to Texas Tati! Wherever you're putting down roots Texas is an amazing choice! I actually thought you were moving to Florida but I am so happy you've come to Texas. By the way, you're officially a Texan when you start saying y'all without thinking about it! ^^
I love this vlog!!!
More vlogs please! This was great xxx
I loved the vlog.
Yes, vlog your transition to Texas life. The people are incredibly nice in general!
Yeeee hawwww 🤠👢 SO happy for you guys. TX sounds great (compared to Cali) right now but I know God is doing great things all over and hopefully, CA will make some positive changes. I so appreciate you Tati 💗
I love Vlogging Tati. This is good and fun. We need more of this.

I'm so happy you decided on TX. You'll LOVE IT HERE!! Don't ever complain about the heat, it's only a couple of months AND IT'S SO worth the rest of the year being stunningly beautiful. I can't wait to live in the middle of nowhere too. Congrats!

I love the vlogs!  It makes you even more relatable!!!
yess more Tati!! ❤️❤️
Tati this is one of the most happiest times of your life to come!! and yes is lovely for you to share video logs like this because in a way believe it also inspires us to the rest that also wants to make huge changes for the good. So seeing how you are growing more into a peaceful state of mind and leaping into the faith of trusting that God's hand is holding yours and James' too is an example to never give up in the storm times and celebrate that the Sun will rise again....Love you to the Moon and back....!!
I absolutely love Texas!!! I've gone to 3 different cities and the people were so welcoming and nice everywhere. I hope you guys have a smooth move and many blessings to your new start!
please share your road trip to texas and more of your moving journey. Then when you set up your house, I'd love to see a tour.

“We love the weather.” Which part? 110 degrees in August? Tornado? Hail storms? The two days of fall? Honest question from a Texan.
More vloooooggs
Totally here for the vlogs!! Laughing cause I'm moving from California to Seattle soon because I want clouds and less sun 🤣🤣
Loove your vlog! 🤩

Love these type of videos. I’d love to come with y’all through the process. So happy for you two!!! 😊😘
Totally guessed you were moving to TX!
That is so awesome! I know how you feel I bought acreage in Oklahoma. Best decision ever. It was raw land and a lot of work but after it was all finished I love it! We have deer that come up by the house. It’s so quiet and peaceful. I can walk out and have complete privacy. Drink coffee and watch the birds in my bird feeder. Next we’re building chicken coop and building a barn for the horses.  Enjoy the next chapter in your life!!
Eeeeeeeee!!! I’m tickled pink that you are coming here to Texas! I live in the Texas panhandle and if you come anywhere up in north Texas bring lots and lots of moisturizer!
Texas!! Yay!. You're going to love it!
Love this.  Want more.
Would love more vloging!
Yes bring more real life into it! I’m excited for you! 🥰
We want to move out of Oregon so bad. It is absolutely toxic here. The crime, homeless camps, drugs, corruption is out of control. Our government is only making it all worse. Will not change as long as there is mail in voting.
I’m so excited for your new chapter. I like vlogs more than beauty videos these days so Im all in on the new content!
Yeah!!! Welcome to Texas!
I’m soooo excited!!! You are going to love it here❤️welcome to Texas

Love my state of Texas!  It has really become popular with YT'ers: Marlena, Angelica, Lisa, Taylor, Steff, & now Tati.. etc... Did she mentioned which city?
I KNEW it was Texas! My guess is Dallas, it’s booming here.   My husband and I are actually making our first cross country move on our own to Seattle early next year, so seeing your process is fun. Good luck on your new adventure!
I live for literally any Tati content!❤️ I am so happy for you and can’t wait to see more of this journey! You are so amazing and I love you❤️

I enjoy the vlog style videos these days.
Welcome to Texas!! Hope this move will give you the fresh start you are looking for!
Love it
May God Bless your new Journey and Home and You and family🥰🥰🥰 In Jesus name🥰
Welcome to Texas! You have friends here for sure!
Vlogs!! More of this
Does anyone else just feel like Tati needed this fresh start!?! I love seeing how happy you are with your life, your husband, and puka shell 🐚 I want to wish you and your family many many new blessings in your new place!! Xoxo 😚
10:30 it kinda looks like she is wearing a crown or a tiara like the queen she is !! With the sunshine on the top of her head 💙
Loved the vlog  concept 💕
I knew it was Texas when you said you wanted to grow roots. Welcome to Texas, we are glad to have you! 🤠
You will find your ring when you start unpacking. It had to make its way home to show you!!!!  It was in the place it was always meant to be.
From a born and breed Texas girl, WELCOME!! I love the space, freedom, and friendly people here. 😁
OMG YAY WELCOME TO TEXAS!!!😍❤️
Honestly I liked your content, but I can’t support you coming to Texas. It’s been a nightmare for us to have Californians and the northwesterns moving here and being completely disrespectful to our culture and also driving up our housing costs and taxes. I wish they just wouldn’t. It’s sad to see Texas falling so far because of them. Please reconsider moving here. I understand Colorado is nice this time of year.
Love the vlog! Of course we love the make-up (duh) but I would so love more of this!
This was so fun!!! I loved seeing this!
I live in Southwest Kansas, Dodge City.  I wouldn't change it for the world.
Tati, you genuinely look so happy! Wishing you nothing but the best, you deserve it! ❤ Thank you for taking us along with you!
Yassss more vlogs!!!!! Love this
Your tweet is my dream too, I was telling my husband about it, and having a property big enough to just disappear on for a hours on horseback and pack a picnic and have our own camping and now worry about neighbors breathing on my neck!! So happy for you guys!
Omg I knew it. When the music started I was like she is moving to Texas. Idk why. I lived in Texas for about 3 years near Fort Worth and fell in love. My best friend lives in Humble TX outside Houston
I just moved to Houston Texas & bought a home. You get more bang for your buck here for sure. I know the feeling of being totally overwhelmed w moving 😅
So excited for you!!  It was so fun watching the process and would love to see your new place in Texas!!
Welcome to Texas!  We love it here <3
TEXAS...WOW !!!! Remember, in Texas it's all about BIG hair, and good makeup. Hope you do a part two vlog. How is Puka handling the move?  Hope there is a Target close to your new home.  Maybe your other family members will move to Texas as well.
Happy for your new chapter!
Tati, I loved this video/vlog. Looking forward to seeing more of these. Best wishes on your new home. Enjoy Texas!
Yes to the vlogs!!
I want James to do more videos on his favorite things or just with you
Love this vlog ❤️

Love the vlog!! I remember moving from Philadelphia to Chicago not knowing anyone or having family nearby and I will say that I grew so much from that experience! You are going to do great things in Texas ❤️
I'm from a small town in East Texas close to Louisiana but live just outside of San Antonio Texas.
We are going to miss you in Washington!

Congratulations on moving to the best state and that is TEXAS.
Wow! Such a big and exciting change! A lot of people seem to be moving to Texas. Good luck with everything! ❤

Where in Tx???
WELCOME TO TEXAS !
More of this please 😍😍😍
Welcome to Texas! I'm born and raised here and love it.
Texas!! Woo hoo! I’m in Dallas… So I’ll just say WELCOME Y’ALL! So excited I got to see Pooka and James (sorta saw him, but still)! 🤣❣️🥰
I would be sooooo happy to see more vlogs from you ❤️❤️❤️
Tati...you didn't get over 8 million subscribers "just for the makeup" we are here for you! Don't doubt that💖💖💖
I moved from two houses in two different states than left the country to live overseas all in one months time! I can imagine how overwhelmed u are but it’ll be over soon!!! Best of luck ❤️
Yessssss more vlogs!!! More lifestyle and cooking!!!!
That’s a beautiful Steinway
two things: (a) LOVE this format- after the past couple years of isolation I wanna see adventures! real life! people doing... things! lol and (b) low-key jealous of your move to somewhere with SUNSHINE- I've lived in NW WA (Olympic peninsula) for 20 years and the 9ish months of dark and rain each year are just too much 😣I need some big, open sunsets in my life.... can't wait to see your new content, and congrats!
Tati vlogs! What dreams are made of! Hello James! So good to hear you! We love you dude.
I'm so happy for you Tati  I wish you  all the happy memories in the new place.
Omg girl yesss welcome  I live in Texas 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Welcome to Texas, Tati!!!!!!!  Love the makeup and the vlogging!
I love this format way more!!!
Congrats on the move! I look forward to a slow motion video of Pooka running in the grass, free as a bird! Best of luck with the renovations. I hope we get to see the progress and your new beauty studio soon!
can't wait for the day you ride your horse!
I am so happy for you guys, change is very good. Yes I LOVE the vlogs !!
Well I'm a slight bit bitter here, fellow washingtonian north of you. But this vlog has almost sold me. I don't know if I could handle being land locked?? You're just so damn cute, I'm thrilled for you guys. ❤️
Omg a tati vlog !!!! 🤩🤩🤩
Vlogging Tati 🦋
This was an awesome peek! Yeah, I think a vlog every couple of weeks would be so fun and would kind of break up the makeup content in a good way
I love how you're taking us with you on this journey! Makeup is great, but this is better!!!!! Keep vlogging ❤
Would love vlogs to be mixed in with normal content. 💗 from Texas☺️
I am suprised that you did not move somewhere else to in california? like san francisco or san diego.
Welcome to Texas! Seems like a good fit for u. Good luck! Also, YES to more vlogs!
I knew it!!! Welcome to Texas
Love the vlogs….and can’t wait to see the new home journey….also…loved the tiny peek at James….miss him!!! Love ya both!!!
Welcome to Texas !!!
I like this vlog a lot but I hope you don’t stop tutorials/reviews!  Also welcome to Texas from an east Texas gal here 🙋🏼‍♀️! The taxes are pretty great and it is a great place to raise a family!
Really enjoy this format, keep doing this! Would love a part 2. 💕
Love the vlog style! Keep them coming!
I love vlogs. More please 🙏
Yes! More lifestyle videos please ❤️
We are buying our first house together (2nd marriage for me, 1st for him) and we are staying in our hometown but I’m stressed and we have not even made an offer on a house. I could just imagine how you are feeling. But I know that we will be so happy when we find, buy, pack, move and start living in our forever home. Good luck! Happy traveling! Don’t forget to stop and smell the roses ❤️
Love Texas. Enjoy your new adventure!
Why all Californians moving to Tx?
Inshallah Everything will Be Great For U:) Wish u The Very best of Luck & Happy Life :)
Congratulations on your move. I wish you all the best.  When I was younger I loved 👠! Shoes and bags were my thing. Lol. I'm older now but also had some medical issues that caused weight gain & some physical issues so unfortunately heels (for the most part) are out of the question. Can sometimes do a chunky heel or wedge tho. I sure do miss that part of my life. ☹️
Welcome to Texas, friend! Although I'm not normally a vlog fan, I do love this edit!
I loved this ❤
I love vlogs!!
Yay Tati, I am excited for you all!👏🏽 I would love more vlogs like this. Sometimes, I feel that you don’t give yourself enough credit Tati. You been through so much and you are strong and such a wonderful person. I am one of your oldies and I have witnessed it all and I admire you so much. I am a believer on not letting anything of anyone take your joy and I am happy to see your joy coming back. I love when you play with makeup, you are definitely in your happy place. Thanks for taking us along. I wish you blessings upon blessings!🙏🏽💖🤗✌🏽
Love love love this content!!!
LOL. Might as well eat that 4th popsicle because you'll have to clean out the freezer tomorrow anyway! (memories of being forced to eat ice cream and other frozen foods when we were moving. . . )
I'm loving this style of content from you! I've done the whole up and move my life to start a new adventure thing and it has been one of the most special experiences of my life. Hang in there! TX is where I'm from, and I hope it treats you well! 🥰
So excited for you!!!!
Texas??? Girl what? Whyyyyy
I vote more VLOGS!!! I love seeing another side of you other than makeup! Which I still love too! ❤️💕
Really enjoyed this! Like both worlds!
Welcome to Texas! You’re going to love it!
Hi from Bainbridge Island 😊 we just moved from FL and know absolutely no one here! Moving was a whirlwind but the end is worth it! Good luck ✨
Hey! I’ve been a follower of this channel for so long I can’t even remember when exactly! Tati, you’ve kept me company so many times throughout those years while I work, get ready to go out, take a shower, lay in bed doing nothing and so on. I don’t usually comment cause I’m a bit insecure about my english, my native language is brazilian portuguese, sometimes I struggle to express myself in other languages. But I wanted to make sure you understand how I admire you and support your whole journey that’s clearly been very hard lately. I want to let you know that you’ve helped me a lot in many moments and you just did that again in this video. I’ve been going through some hard stuff as well and I can find motivation in your strength to keep moving and looking forward to the future with hope and optimism. Watching you struggle to pack stuff to move was SO relatable I can’t even describe it! I love this type of content and I am here in Brazil sending you all the good energy and motivation to keep going in search of the happiness and balance you’ve been searching for. Wish you all the best! XO’s (ps.it’s good to have you back, I’ve missed your videos when you took a break, even though I totally support that action)
Love this video.....real life!!!!!!!
Welcome to Texas!  I live on the SE Texas Gulf Coast. Texas is big and you can lick the weather and landscape you like!
Yay Texas!!!!! I’m overwhelmed with excitement 💖💖💖
I knew you were moving to Texas!!! I moved to Houston  from Nebraska 3 years ago and I love it 🤠❤ welcome to Texas!!! We can be friends 🥰
Engagement comment 🥰
May I just say I'm so happy that you and James got through a really rough patch and are still together.  I firmly believe that unless there is abuse (or things like that) in a relationship -- Love is a choice.  After the endorphins wear off, when you've been together for 5+ years, there WILL be rough patches.  It's at those times that you have to remember why and how you got together in the first place and made a life-long commitment.  It's easier sometimes to leave.  It really is.  But if BOTH people want to stay and want to truly work on things, those rough patches can end up making your relationship even better, more solid and deeper.  Much love to you both!   I'm happy for you!!
I am so happy for you Tati, but when I clicked this video I was :”please say Europe, please say Europe” so i can have a chance to met you in person, but I am happy for you anyway🤗
Moved from CA to TX 11 years ago. Best decision for us!
❤️❤️❤️❤️
I've been watching your channel, Tati for a longtime now...but I've never commented before🤦‍♀️ TBH this is the BEST vlog I've ever seen on YouTube- PLEASE, PLEASE KEEP THEM COMING FOR US TATI LOVERS!!🙏🥰 P.S. Your fur baby, I just can't 🐾❤ xoxo
I KNEW it was gonna be Texas or florida
I honestly think Southern culture will be a breath of fresh air for you. There's a politeness down here that can be really comforting.
Welcome to Texas!!!
Absolutely start doing more vlogging.  I would love to see renovation & your inspirations for it!
All of the love and prayers for your new adventure!!
Yes we want to see it all. Best wish to you and James on your new adventure.  How exciting.  Can't wait to see it
So happy for you an James and mr. Puca!
Im thrilled for you, welcome beloved Tati!  Texas is gonna be a great fit for you & James!  🥰
I like this kind of videos!! I also miss those “empty bins” videos and seeing James in the videos too!
Small places make me feel like a can't breathe so I give you props for your endurance of it as long as you did
Love this video 😍
As a Texan……. I’m so happy to have Tati here!!!
Why did I know it was Texas!! Also the makeup you did is one of my favourite looks on you, you look absolutely stunning Tati. Good luck with your move xx

Tati, I’ve always wondered.. and I’m sorry if have already said it in some video or some other place. But your audio always sounds so good, what mic do you use to film?
Congratulations on moving to TX!!!  I wish you and James the absolute best new fresh start in TX.  Also, love this kind of content in addition to the makeup.  Love you oodles! 😄❤️
I love this vlog video.  So exciting to share your new chapter with you.
Loved it ❤
As a native Texan, I welcome you to my home state!
Tati just know those that are here, are here for YOU. Give us all the videos. Sending you so much love.
Welcome to Texas!!! I am glad you are realizing your dream of land and possible horses. I was 40 when I got my horses. It’s the best life I have ever had. I have enjoyed my life in the country so much. I hope you do the same!!!❤️❤️❤️
I was sure it will be Florida 😅 dont know why
We love this content. More vlogs please. Yes we come for the makeup but we stay for you and to see more of you is fantastic.
I moved to texas after living in Alaska my whole life because my husband got stationed at fort hood. For some reason I always get so happy finding out when celebrities / influencers live here. People and places are so fun here. It's the summer heat that gets me. Good luck on your endeavers.
This was so beautiful, Tati! I love seeing a more real, less "LA" side to you. It's amazing seeing your journey, and happy you are sharing!
Welcome to the south Tati!!! I’m so excited to see more vlogs!
I just screamed out loud and fist pumped the freaking air. Let's gooooooooo! TEXAS BABY! OMG 🥳 yay!!!
More vlogs about moving please!
Yay! You'll love it here, Tati! So excited to have you in state!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🐶
I really liked the vlog vibe! It was really different and fun 😊
Omg! How exciting!! Im from north Texas and just visited Seattle this week, you will love it here! My only complaint about Seattle was how rude everyone is, southern hospitality is a real thing in Texas 💗💗
My dog is also terribly anti social🤣🤣
Good luck in new place🤗💖 best wishes 😘💖
Funny you coming to Texas cuz Seattle is grey. I’m watching in Texas and it’s Seattle grey here 😃🌧👍🏻
So exciting! I hope everything went really well and you are happily settling into Texas!!! 💗 from Pennsylvania.
LOL that juice pop made a pretty lippie for you. 😂  I HATE moving house! I downsized and downsized and downsized for about ten solid years so I was moving a lot. Blurgh. I wish I’d just burned down my big house to begin with. 🤣😵‍💫 Now I’m FT RVing and we move every couple of months, and ironically, I’m happier than ever. 🤷🏼‍♀️  GL with the move!!! Very exciting!
Just like you I am in the golden years of my life, enjoy the process and thank you for taking us along Xx
WELCOME TO TEXAS TATI ❤️ y’all will love it! I’ve been here my whole life, wouldn’t be anywhere else!
Welcome to texas!! Happy to have you ☺️☺️
My dream vlog yo
Love you. Best wishes in Texas looking forward to the home tour. You should open with footage of you playing your piano!
please continue vlogging!
I completely understand where you're coming from! Four months ago I packed everything and moved 500 miles, from TN to PA. I was so unhappy & stressed in TN for way too long & something had to give. I needed to do something for myself. I moved completely by myself, I knew no one, but I'm so much happier. I FINALLY feel like I'm home & you will too. I'm so excited for you, James & sweet little Puka!
More Vlogs - PLEASE
You will love Texas. We just moved from Texas in September 2021. We lived there for 25 years. I miss my friends and family.
Girl,if anyone does not need make up to look beautiful, it's you
I'm so excited. I live in the general Austin area (I hope you are moving to the Austin area).  I love this kind of content from you.
Such beautiful style of vlog. I really loved it.
I feel like I'm just getting to know you 💖 we need more vlogs!! Maybe make a second channel for vlogs?! Moving can be so stressful, God bless you in this difficult journey to a better life Tati!! 🙏❤️
Tati: "this room is so small, there's no much space, etc." Me: litterally living in a two room apartment with no space for a couch ahahah One day I'm gonna be able to afford a comfort space that I can call home :D
Welcome to Texas, Tati! We’re happy to have you.
Welcome to Texas!  Can’t wait to see your new place😘😘😘
Totally love this style! Feels so much more personal (because obviously it is…lol). So excited for your moving journey! I think you’re going to thrive in Texas! 💕
Yes! Part two, please!
Yay! Texas for the win!!  Welcome y’all!!
Yay!!!! I couldn't be more excited if it was me moving to Texas, Tati! I loved seeing Pooka and am happy that he'll have a yard. Also loved hearing James' voice again. Such a great guy! Moving is soooo stressful but if we think of it as a new adventure and visualize what's at the end of all of the work, it makes everything so much less stressful and more exciting. I have SO ENJOYED  this vlog. Keep vlogging, please, Tati. Can't wait to see your new home, new studio and Pooka in his new yard!! God's Blessings! 🙏🏻 Safe travels!!
All the best to your new state and place Ms Tati!
Congrats!!! Thanks for sharing. I thought maybe gonna be Franklin or Nashville, TN.

I'm a Texan! You have definitely made a great choice!!
”Wait, seven eleven?” 🤣🤣🤣
Texas! I'm in Texas working for a few months!
As soon as you said you were moving I immediately thought Texas!!
This makes me want to pack up and move from cold PA and move to Texas.. maybe one day
Omg I guessed Texas and I was right 🥰 I think you will love it
Really enjoyed this style of video, more please x
Congrats! Texas is nice.
Yay! Coming to Texas!!
Welcome to Texas, Puka and fam. You're gonna love it.
I love the moving vlog.
Love that you are still doing the Scott Barnes lip trick. You are STUNNING Tati ❤️
Everyone is fleeing to Texas! I don’t blame them. Remember why you’re moving there and keep it that way! 🇺🇸
100000000000% PLEASE keep doing vlogs!!! I've been waiting for sooo long for Tati Vlogs. I'm living right now. 💕🤠
I’m here for the vlogs 🙌 and welcome to Texas 🤗
congrats on the move!! love this kind of content. it was so nice to see you in your everyday life again. seeing you pack your makeup was really helpful as we have a big move coming up as well to FL from AZ and I have to pack my beauty room and im terrified
Love these type of vlogs!!!! Less shaking the cam though 😁🥴
I knew it. Lol  Everybody is moving to Texas
Omg.!!! That’s so exciting.!!! Welcome to Texas.! We are thrilled to have you.!
We have never met, not even exchanged words on internet but somehow I connected to you happiness and relief of leaving a temp safe place to go do your thing freely and with a fresh attitude. I’m so glad you got to this point and only have good wishes for you and all your community.
Don't you all wish we could really apply makeup in that super speed? Lol
This whole new chapter is going to be amazing for you guys! So happy for you! You'll love it there. Cheers to new roots!
Loving this Tati. Please keep up the vlogging. I love the makeup but I love the you too
I miss James on your videos!! All the best luck in the world with the move!
That is literally so crazy I’m moving to Texas in September!
Glad your back

welcome to texas friend! i hope you love it
Love this so much
Welcome to Texas ❤🥰
Tati I love the VLOG! Keep doing it, if you could vlog about the whole remodel that will be really cool to watch !
I definitely liked this style of video!
I knew it! Welcome to Texas, way different than Seattle and so you!
I love this type of video! Please do more. Congrats on the move and best of luck to you, James and Puka!
Life goal - Get to a point where I think this home is small. 😭
My guess was Colorado
Tati im loving this side of you that comes out in the vlogs! Its playful and raw ! Im rooting for you and hope to see many more! Vlogs are my favorite!!! Im also about to make a giant life changing move from ca to Tennessee i couldn’t be more scared but im excited i have someone to watch who is doing a move too ❤️ cant wait for the next video!
Love a vlog !! More plz !!
Love getting to see this side of Tati! I think it’s so easy to forget that the people we watch on YouTube are real humans and it so good to see the growth you’re going through. Literally screamed “YESSS” when you said Texas! Welcome to the south! Praying that you and James find community and are able to establish roots here. Sending you hugs from Waco! 💞
Texan here! Yay!!! Congratulations on the move and I would love to see more vlog content! Fresh start and starting from scratch is the best.
Don't blame u for leaving commie ca
Huzzah! Congrats on your new chapter. May you find exactly what you need :) Texas sure seems to be the IT place for you beauty creators.
Loveeee this content I would like moreee ❤❤❤❤
I'm so excited for you. You know what they say? New house new baby. It's going to happen for you and James. Sending prayers love and positive energy ❤️❤️🙏🙏
I wish you nothing but hapiness. Hell we all deserve it. Really liked this.
How exciting for you! Texas is great! I lived there for 2.5 years in Houston and had such a wonderful experience.  Hopefully it brings you as much joy as it brought me.
Tati!!!! I hope it’s austin! I would love to meet you and connect. Respect you and your journey. If it is Austin and need a mobile hairstylist for blowouts hit me up. I cater to affluent clientele and make house calls. 💕😊✨🙌🏽 so excited to see your new adventure!
I like the vlog.  Its good to see the “normal” you.
Love it Tati!!!!! Part 2, part 3,part 4 please!!!! I Hate moving but I Love the Destination!!!!
please keep up these videos! Love the style and love the change! I’d love if you did more lifestyle videos
While we currently live in WA state I grew up in the San Antonio area.  You're gonna love Texas ! But beware it is hot as hell!!!!
I vote for more videos like this!!  Love it
Welcome to Texas! I hope you love it here. Much love from Waco. ❤️
Good luck in Texas.
Yay for Texas! And please continue to do more life vlogs! Lifestyle & beauty would be perfect!
6 years ago I moved to Texas by myself without knowing a single soul here, and it was the best choice I ever made. I do still feel like a foreigner sometimes when they start getting real REAL southern on me, but at its heart, it really is a good place for a fresh start and to make a home for yourself. (Plus the Tex-mex is a huge bonus!)
I hope in a big way she finds here weddingring...  keeping fingers cross! xxxx
Love the blog style as well.
So excited for you and James, Tati! Yay for new beginnings! Would love to see more vlog content❤️
I knew it Texas ! Welcome to the sunny weather , but in Houston?
LOVING the vlog. Would love to see them more and more in the future!
I knew it!!!! My guess was Tennessee or Texas and I was right!!! Best of luck!
Love the vlog and congrats on your move? Can't wait to see the land and your reno's :)
So excited for you guys, hope to see more of James in the future. I'm excited your moving to Texas, I was born and raised here 😍 I know it's a big state but I hope I get to run into you some day

You enjoy yourselves guys and take care, take time. And Tati thanks again : my blendifull and my Tati palette are still my fav and I love the kiwi vitamins also!! You’ll be my fav forever and I wish you many more success so I can enjoy them hahaha xxxx love you 😽
It's really lovely to get to know you in a different way, and see a different side of you and your life
Keep at your piano, sister!  If it’s too emotional to play what you normally play, embark on a new adventure and play something else!  The possibilities are literally endless.
Love vlogs! Keep them coming! AND WELCOME TO TEXAS!
Welcome to Texas 🤠
I will be your friend….I live in Texas born and raised!! But Texas is large so I will probably never run into you…. Boo!
I wish there was a super-like button... Youtube can follow me for more suggestions 🤗
I love your vlogs!! Please do more, we  ❤ you
Yes more vlogs pls ❤
Vlog more!!  The fireplace in Seattle is gorgeous.  A new state and a new home is a way to build up again.
You will LOVE Texas. I love it there!
cant wait to see more vlogs Tati ❤️❤️
Good luck Tati! May you be blessed in your new chapter of your life and have an amazing life in your new house
Awwwh I can't believe you're gone, I hoped I would meet you at Target or Sephora one of these days🤣 But im happy for you and happy you're happy 💖💖💖
Love the blog Tati! Also, respecting that James won’t be on camera but it’s great to hear his voice and know he’s well! Let him know he’s been missed! 💜
Talking to my self in the car. Thanks. Cheers!!! Lmao!!  So excited to see your new adventure in Texas!!! Congrats!!!
Love the vlog, please keep sharing! I hope y'all have an safe moving process. 😘
Sharing all of your packing for moving shows how ready you really are. You have so much strength inside you, next to you and behind you that every moment will be amazing even though very tiring!
Ha! I knew it was Texas! All the influencers are flocking to our state. Hope y’all don’t vote to make our state as bad as the states everyone’s running from.
Hello! I’m a long time viewer from Texas! So excited to see more content like this ☺️
Love this vlog Tati!! Missed James and Puka!!!❤️ Congrats on the move!!! Can't wait for more updates from you!!! Good luck!!! Xoxo 😘
Love a vlog from you!
Love your creative filming style.
Best of luck with everything-had so much watching this! Puka is so cute!
I LOVE THE VLOGS! I haven’t been watching as much makeup content in general these days but videos like this make my heart happy
Just Breathe.... YAY 🥂💐 CONGRATS TATI SO EXCITED FOR YOU TO SHED THE OLD AND START A NEW. GOD BLESS YOU DOLLFACE! CHEERS TO NEW BEGINNINGS 🥂 Thanks for  bringing us along and sharing.
I was born and raised here in Texas. I could never call home anywhere but here. I love the people here and love the conservative values we have here. Everyone talks so bad about how “conservative” we are but are moving here. Tati seeing that you are embracing your faith I am sure you will love it here! There are churches everywhere! And we here in Texas value family, faith and our freedom. Welcome To Texas!! Ps you may not like summers but you’ll get use to it!🥰
Love the vlogs !! Have been waiting for your videos from such a long time 💖💖keep doing the vlogs love seeing u n puka
Congratulations on your new digs! ❤️❤️
💝💝💝🙏🙏🙏🙏💝💝💝💝.  You can do this.   💝💝💝💝💝💝🙏🙏🙏🙏💝💝💝💝
WøW congratulations Tati & James 🖤🤎🕊️
Love this!!! Omg please share move vlogs of the journey 💕🤗 congrats on your new home
You look gorgeous and very youthful without any make up on actually!! ✨✨
I was so hoping you would say Colorado,  but Colorado is mostly occupied by Texans, so maybe here will be next.  Lol.  300 days of sunshine a year is a big draw for people who NEED sunshine like you
Great vlog!! Loved it!! Love your makeup vlogs but also found this one so much fun!!! Good luck with your move!! Great things coming your way! Onward and upward in Texas!!❤️
I’m so very happy for you both and truly hope you find contentedness and calm in your next chapter! 🤍  Also, i do enjoy the vlog but do what feels natural at the time! 🙂
All about vlogs! Best of luck in Texas! Can’t wait to see more like this
Welcome to Texas!!  You couldn’t have chose a better state to live in!! I’m loving this vlog and time with pooka 🐶 Can’t wait to see where you ended up…. My guess is somewhere outside of Dallas or Austin. As usual loving all your content. Safe travels and God Bless 🙏🙏🙏
OMG, you are coming to my wonderful State of Texas.  Welcome and I think you will LOVE it here
Loved this vlog style video!! TX is going to be great to you.
Texas is amazing! I’m in Fort Worth! :)
Please do more videos like this🙌🏼💕
If you are moving to/ around Austin, I think Christy Carlson Romano lives there and I feel like you guys would be a fun collab 😊
Loved this vlog, would love to see more like this! Also those popsicles are the best.
I love you so much tati!!! And i love this style of videos, and awww pucca!!!!!
Welcome Texas 🥰🥰🥰
Vlogs 100%!! Good luck at the new place!!
Puka is going to be like my dog an air-conditioning type dog. My dog has a whole yard and never goes outside. She's such a diva.
Yay 😁 congratulations 🎉
Best of luck with the move! Welcome y’all from another Texan! Wishing you all the best! 💜

Im so so so happy for you Tati. Texas is great❤️
more vlogs!!!!
Welcome to the best place in the world!!!!  Yes, I am partial, but still true!!#texasgirlforlife
OMG Texas run by morally and spiritually handicapped governor and Senator Cruz.  My daughter moved to Texas and the only things she loves is the RE options vs Cali
I love these vlogs!
You can do it Tati ❤️❤️❤️ best of luck, sending you good vibes 🥰✨
Hi Tati. Lol so american to say, this is my tiny home :D. Dont want to make it sound mean, but Im living in Czechia in like a 2KK 56m2?, which is considered ok. I know everything is bigger in the US, but still kinda shocking considering what is the standart over here. :D Sorry in case it sounded mean, im just trying to grasp the situation.
I am actually way more excited for this than I have been for makeup lately!!!
Texas, wow. Far away. That will be amazing for you.
So happy for you!!! We will be neighbors..Louisiana gal right here! Southern charm at its finest. And also, LOVE this type of video!! Can’t wait to see your new home! ❤️
I love the vlog! Congratulations on your move, can't wait to see your new happy place!
I also have a lovely white mini baby grand that gets pulled apart for moving and has chips and wear (and I don't play it at all. Not sure if I will again.)
More vlogs please 😁
Been in Texas for 13 years now. Yeeehaw, welcome!!! ❤️
Yaaaaay!!!!!  I was born and raised here.  It’s so laid back and free.   Many blessings to you.  Welcome!   ❤️
I enjoy the vlogs. I look forward to seeing your new studio. Moving is pain in the behind for sure. I've still got stuff in totes from when I moved to TN from ME seven years ago. LOL. You will miss being close to family, but that is what air travel is for! All the best to you and James in your new home.
Welcome to Texas, Tati!  Love this journey for you!
I love the lifestyle vlogs!!!!
I am happy for you and yes PART 2!!!!
I LOVE this!!! More vlog style videos please 😍😍😍 So excited for it!!!!
Tati we moved from the East coast to Texas in 2020.  We built on some beautiful property.  You will definitely have more sun here!  ☀️ You will be fine, the people here are SO friendly!  Our neighbors are amazing & always willing to help!  Welcome to Texas!  🇺🇸
So happy for your new adventure Tati! 🥰 My family just made the big move from Guam to Texas about 8 months ago, and it was the best decision we ever made. I hope you and your little family love Texas as much as we do. ❤
Love these kind of videos!
Welcome to Texas!  Love the blog!  Best of luck on your new adventures! Can’t wait to see!
Texas sounds idyllic, till you remember their governor and senators 🤨
I'm so excited for you guys!!!! I love Texas! It's a beautiful state! You're going to have a blast! Cannot wait to see more Tati vlogs!!!
Texas is actually a good state to live in. People bring politics into everything for reasons why not to love here but we like Texas the way it is. 🤷🏻‍♀️
I find it very hard to Get glam and dress nice only for myself. I’m always at home but I also want to feel good about myself but I also am lazy and don’t want to spend money on things that nobody will ever see
Loving the vlog!! Good luck on your move and cheers to a clean slate!
I loved this vlog. Please do more!
Yes yes yes more vlogs please!
This was fun to watch.  You can do this, Tati!
I loooove this style of vlog. Just hanging out with you (and James) is the best. I’m so happy for you guys and can’t wait to hopefully see the new place! I think with covid, I’m not into the make up videos at much, but I miss the casual vlogs. Will you be doing any gardening?
Love this new style of content. You should definitely do more vlogs :)
Love the vlog style! Also excited for this new chapter in your life!
More home family and makeup please! This is great!
Welcome to Texas! Howdy from Fort Worth!
Loved the vlog! Good luck with the move!
Tati, This vlog was good 👍 This is the kind of vlogging you should add to your schedule for at least a while. Good luck with your new adventure getting your new place ready. Hope all goes well for you and I am looking forward to seeing some new videos soon.

Love the vlog, the content, the you without anything! I'm all in!
I love texas ❤️
This is really exciting! My bf and I are doing the same thing in a few months, moving to Atlanta not knowing anyone, but just being so happy about the decision. It really is liberating (and terrifying) all at the same time. I’m really happy for you ❤️
I'm from Texas, nice people come from there😉 I hope your new start is blessed and you find your happy!😊 Can't wait to see what you get up to and what God has waiting for you guys 🤗
Yes, yes, yes to more of this!

I want to move to Wilmington without knowing anyone for similar reasons- more affordable and nice weather. Scary to take that jump Though
I love the vlog!! Please keep vlogging!
So excited for your next chapter!!  Please bring us along for the journey!  TBH Im not wearing a whole lot of makeup and am more interested in your journey as you evolve!  I went through some seriously hard times over past couple years losing loved ones, having a stroke after my vaccine and dealing with a lot of setbacks.  I have been changing my priorities and it’s wonderful to see the other aspects of your life - rebuilding - the hope and joy of learning from our experiences.  I am starting over in so many ways (rebuilding health, finances, spirituality) and seeing you take us along for your journey is inspiring and heartwarming.  Love your positivity.  Sending you, James and Puka all the best during your next chapter!!.  Love you!!  ❤️❤️🦋🦋🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Great vlog! Can’t wait to see the new Texas digs
Welcome to Texas Tati. I hope you love it as much as Texans love Texas!
I am happy to hear you're going to a place you're excited about...but I'm in Kent, WA (15 min from Seattle) and it was cool to have you here. But knowing where you're at in your life with God and what I believe politically, Texas is a fantastic choice. I really admire the way you and James stick together, and realized you needed a season here in WA state to spend more time with your family and do some healing. Can't wait to see the new place!!! God bless you and James...oh, and your sweet pup.
I am here for the Vlogs!  Please do more. Good luck with the move. Wish you all the best.
This was so exciting to experience this with you!! Congratulations to you and, James on your new home/adventure. 🤞🏾❤️ Also, the popsicles are giving me craving vibes 😍🙏🏾 lol GOD BLESS your new journey.
Wait, is James from Texas?! Will You tell us like where-ish in Texas?! Can we please have a video with Chip and Joanna Gaines some day?!?
Wow the editing and format was fantastic !
Seeing Tati rise up like that just motivate me even more.Im gonna do better too..
I wish you showed the new place in this video 🥺
I would never have guesses Texas. I know a lot of Californians are moving there. Good luck with you move. I love vlogs!
YES! Loved seeing you vlog, and I 1000% support more vlogs. Especially to hang out as your new journey unravels. So excited for you!
Good job Tati! 💪🙌👏👏👏 I’m so excited for your moving project - Thanks for sharing 🤩❤️🤩 Please continue vlogging 😘
Ok is this new? They way you showed the product and then shut or turned it to show the brand and then showed applying: ICONIC transitions! I LOVED this! Am I living under a rock and you've always done that?! LOVE IT!
I’m so hopeful that you’ll find your wedding ring while unpacking in Texas. 😀
This was great! So happy & excited for you. New chapter will be amazing 🤩 ❤️❤️❤️
Yay for vlogs!
More vlogs!!! Sending y’all so much love! 💕
Great video, Tati!  XOXO
Welcome to Texas!  I grew up in the League city area in between Houston and Galveston for forty years.  I moved to  East Texas two years after living in Idaho Falls Idaho for three years.  Texas has so many opportunities.   The fabulous food bbq, Mexican, and seafood not to mention!  Thanks for sharing your life and beauty content with us!
Loved this video! Very excited for you guys. More vlogs please!
I hate moving. Give me 4 root canals instead any day. lol So excited for your new chapter.
Omg I am excited for this new journey , you look soo much happy Tati and good for you because you deserve that ! Loving these vlogs!!! Good way to start the morning !
I say yes to more vlogs! This was so good to watch! 🤩
Safe travels! I like the vlog format a lot
I’m sooooo excited for you! We moved from Seattle to Texas after having our daughter. Best decision I’ve ever made! I pray blessings over you guys!
Please do a part 2!!!! I loveeeeee this format
I can’t tell you how much I’ve just enjoyed this video! The fast makeup getting ready with the vlog 😍😍😍
God Bless Texas!
This content AND makeup 💄 please. Congratulations on your new home 🏡
I hear you about the process of packing and moving. After my last one I refuse to do it again. I had a feeling you were moving to Texas. Many people are and it seems that you are able to get bigger homes with lots of land at more reasonable prices there. My nephew moved there when he was stationed in the military and never left even after leaving the military. He wouldn’t be able to get the home he has now where he grew up because it would cost a lot more. I think you will all be very happy starting a new chapter in a new area. I can just feel it.  Hopefully you are settled in now or at least until you can get into your house. XO’s
Yay!! My favorite YouTuber is moving to my state!! Texas is an amazing place to live in!! So exited for your new adventure as Texans!!
Z
Good luck and may God give you a new beginning that will make you happy, fulfilled and stress free. I love your vlogs, and something tells me that many others do, so ignore the haters. We don't know them 🤣 Love you and can't wait to see the new place and at least a little bit of your journey. GOOD LUCK!!!! 🤗😘
TEXAS IS THE BEST!!!!
I screamed when Tati said TEXAS like she gonna be my neighbor level of excitement! Welcome to Texas Tati! 🤍
So excited for you both, this will be amazing! Thank you for including us on your venture. Keeping you all in my prayers.
Texas is the best! I’m so excited for you! And gosh I missed hearing James! Best of luck, love the vlog!!
So excited for you and James! And Puka too! You deserve so much happiness and a new start will be so amazing for you. I can't wait to see the journey 🦋💜
Oh yes, I am excited for this new chapter of your life  and I would love to watch more vlogs like this one. I wish you all the best and can't wait to watch your content,  no matter what you will decide to share with us. Much love from Prague,  Czech republic ❤
This was fun.  Even though you are so tired,  there is a great spark in your eyes.
This was so lovely. I'm excited to see more about the new place and renovations.
Love this content 💕 I'm so excited to follow your journey 😊

❤️❤️❤️❤️🏠
Wow! Your town home was so tiny! Your house in Texas is going to be MASSIVE (my assumption)
I love vlogs like this! And with Tati it’s just extra special. My grandpa is from Texas and he’s the sweetest human I’ve ever met. We have lots of family down there.
Hiiiii
Safe travels and hope you are nice and settled in your new home soon 🙂
I loved this vlog and would love to see more.
I vote for a Tati vlog channel!! Like a vlog video once a week doing nothing or everything just being you!
I vote more vlogs! I loved this video! The makeup videos are great but I love seeing the “human” side of Tati it reminds us that you are a real person rather than just a beauty guru!💜 I would watch any video you did but I hope to see more vlogs!
Yes!!! Welcome to Texas! You will love it here!
yes... iam  here love it.. it was nice to hear your soul mate..
Puca is the best lol I personally love vlogs. Would love a morning routine? Good luck on the move!
OMG - I am a Texan and love it here (even though it definitely has its faults). I know you aren’t coming to my city but welcome to where it’s bigger and better!
Texas…born and raised…living in Alabama now. Can’t wait to get back to Texas. I LOVE TEXAS!!!
Watching this surprisingly brought tears to my eyes. Sending so much blessing and love!!
Hi 👋 welcome to Texas Tati !
More vlogs!!! ♥️
To move is always so intense, but also satisfying. To me the time to get rid of so many things and unnecessary stuff, it’s so freeing. I hope you two will be very happy at your new home! Greetings from Switzerland

Love this video style. Would love to see a part two. Also, a monthly favourites would be great. Congrats on the move.
"Freak of the week" 😂😂😂 I'm adopting this one 😂🧡
Hey Tati I grew up in East Texas and had to move to Louisiana as a teenager with my parents but I totally loved it I know ya'll will too. I feel everyone is going to embrace you and just make you part of the family right away. It is like that there... I miss it 😁👍
Hi Tati, love your videos!! You are an inspiration. I wish you the best.  I am a still a learner when it comes to applying eyeshadows. I wish you would do  different eye looks using all of the colors in one palette.
Amazing video! Please do a part two. Very approachable. Love to see other sides to your personality. You can pretty much talk about anything and I’ll watch!
Your mental peace, is more important than anything ... But you know what... And i think thats pretty stupid cuz i just watched you on youtube in your vids... Your LA home was one of a kind.. I am just gonna imagine your new home is like that... I started watching you there... Thats why i was used to that background 🥰... Anyway sending so much love... You deserve each and every happiness in the world...
You will also understand those beautiful Texas days I wish you all the best and the courage to make that big step. Lots of love and positive vibes coming your way and you are in my prayers
We moved 2Xs in less than 9 months, my thoughts and prayers are with y’all!!!  Moving us SOOOOOO stressful!!❤️❤️
Oh man all that makeup. All I have is a tiny little makeup satchel with makeup that’s expired 🤣
Hey when your in Texas tell Kristina Braly Hi for me!!!
U can 100% do this. Yr stronger then you think. Cheers to a new exciting start. Wishing u and James all the luck in the world xxx
I mean Texas really with everything they’re doing to take away women’s rights and trans rights do you have enough money to go to any state in the country why would you choose Texas
Coming to Texas…make sure your AC works, sunscreen and you bring your weight in allergy medicine.
So happy for you Tati! Everyone keeps on coming to Texas. I love that our state is so loved. I want it to remain our great state and not change it to what everyone is leaving.
Loved this so happy for you!! I would love to see your new home❤️❤️❤️

We moved from California to Idaho four years ago and what we love most is the higher level of morality we see every single day! We're so excited for you and wish you the very best on the start of this amazing new adventure! 🙏 From my 5 year old: "We love your videos! I'm so excited to see your new house!"
Yas!! Texas!! My state, baby! Born and raised in East Texas and have made my professional career here in my home town. Love it. I hope you enjoy it here. We have EVERYTHING! ❤
Welcome to Texas!!! Y’all will love it!!!!
I live in South Texas what they call Rio Grande Valley near the border of Mexico.  I live in a town named La Joya Texas.  Texas landscape varies a lot.  There are hills and beach and in between. Wishing you the best in new adventures.  You so deserve it.
Yay!! I'm so happy for you Tati! Welcome to Texas!🤗 I lived in Dallas with my husband for five years but we moved to East Texas in February since we wanted to be closer to nature and live in a more peaceful and quieter place. Moves are always exhausting... But very exciting!❤️
I knew it!! Texas is the best!! I live in Dallas. I see you moved to Texas based on the comments here.. no idea where in Texas. I’m so happy for you!!
looking forward on your new journey Tati!!

Excited to watch you guys blossom in your new home! Love the vlog style and very proud that you have come far enough in your journey to let us into more personal things! That is huge!

Welcome to the Midwest!!!
Voting for more Vlogs like This!!
I have no idea why I cried watching this but I'm SO HAPPY for you. Thank you immensely for being open with us and showing us that it's okay to start over and take charge of your life when it seems like it isn't going your way. I've moved to 4 different countries where I knew no one over the course of 8 years and even though it's hard at the beginning, once you start making friendships, the move is soo worth it. Sending you all the best vibes a prayers in your new adventure. Thanks for all the inspiration Tati <3
Tati is coming to my state!!!
I LOVE this vlog content so much! I hope you enjoy your new home!
WOOO TEXAS YOU'LL LOVE IT
I'm sad i didn't get lucky enough to meet you while you lived in Seattle. I live 1 hour away from Seattle. Best wishes to you and James!
We live for Tati Vlogs!  Congratulations and Safe Travels to your new adventure! We can't wait to see/hear how things go for you :)  We love you Tati!
Hopefully you guys bought a brick house! I heard tornadoes are rolling through today 😳
Tati!!!! I’m so excited for your new journey! I moved from Canada to Texas  3 years ago and I’ve gotta say, I’ve really come to love it here.
The drive from Washington to Texas is long, but amazing! I loved it and wish I could do it again. So glad you're moving to a place you're gonna fall in love with!!
But like how does your makeup still look so amazing at 2 am and mine looks like poop after 2 hours lol. I need Tati one on one training lol ❤️
Yes to more vlogs! 🤗
OMG YES TO THE VLOGS! Would love to see like “what I eat in a day” and stuff like that too!
I am originally from Australia but I live in Montgomery, Texas…. Love it here.  Welcome Tati!👏❤️
yay! Welcome to Texas! We moved here 7 years ago and its the best. Friendliest people :) ~christie
We’re doing it from scratch too…. Moving from CA to Alabama. No family, no connections but the hope of a bright future for us and our children.
I loved it!!!! Blessings on your new journey!! 🙏❤️

I’m here for the vlogs! Love it!
If you started a pooka channel and volged him, I would honestly watch, he is the cutest dog in YouTube.
Love the vlog! I never watched for the make-up, just for your calming prescence and the company, so vlogs are perfect for those of us that are not make-up aficionados. Hope the move goes well :)
So excited for you guys! Cant wait to see your next video❤️❤️❤️
Welcome to Texas! We love you here
Really loved this Vlog Tati!! Please keep them coming!!! ❤️
Oh my, how much I ❤️ this!!!! Please keep vlogging!!
🙄 to enjoy conservative tax cuts because you can't deal with what you voted for. People please stop. Stick it out in the state that your vote ruined.
Tell Puka  his bark in the car was quite manly.
Love your vlog❣️❣️❣️❣️
Go blonde for a little bit.... the light hit u and I saw something....ijs
Vlogs are my favorite, thank you for doing this style of video, Tati! Excited for this next chapter of your life and I hope you’ll continue sharing more of this kind of content!

So looking forward to coming along on your new  journey Tati!  Your dream of living on a big piece of land, enjoying the peace and freedom is the dream/goal of so many others. Cant wait to watch you do it and imagine what it WILL be like once we achieve it too!!! So many new adventures and positive experiences will certainly come your way. Wishing you health and happiness!
Love the vlogs! I figured it would be Texas or Florida ☀️ I’m renovating a home rn. Good luck! You’ll do great!!❤️😊💄
Oh yes more vlogs please! 💛💚💙
Ahhhh! Welcome to Texas!! So exited for you!
Hear me out: Tati needs to somehow befriend Angie Bellmare. Their vibes are so similar.
Loved this vlog!
Yes! More vlogs Tati! ❤️
Tati you have friends in Texas we just haven't met in person yet!
Love it !  Enjoy Texas ❤
My guess is you’re moving to Dallas! That seems like a place where you would fit in- and not too humid for James 😅
omg tati! I´m crying for you, happy tears. I wish you all the happiness in the world ❤️✨
You'll love Texas! I had the chance to grow up there and so thankful for it💚
I am 10000% voting for blogs! I'm sending you good vibes and well wishes on your new journey!!! So exciting!!! ❤️
Yes I love the vlogs Tati! I’ve been watching your videos for 5 years now and would love to see you in your life!
Once you're settled, would love to see a what I eat in a day video 💜
Depending on WHERE in Texas .  But i figure Texas or Tennessee.   Its where most are migrating too. Congratulations to you and James overcoming every obstacle .
Yaaas tati yaaas ❤
Hey Tati I am so excited to hear you are moving to Texas. I lived hear my whole life and it’s great you will become a country girl in no time

I've been watching since the beginning and love watching you grow!  Makeup, lifestyle, vlogging -- I'm here for whatever content you want to post. 😘😘
Will it be Houston Austin or dallas
Yay!! We can’t wait to have you in Tx! 🤍
More of THIS content Tati!!

I loved this vlog style video! More of this please! Good luck with the move!
I'm so emotional- we get to hear James and we get to hear great news! Congrats on this new chapter 💞
Dear Tati. I am glad for your happiness. I with to you and James too safety journey.Have a wonderful new lifestyle in Texas. I am so waiting the new videos about your new experience.
I had a feeling you were moving here to texas!!! I wonder what city…..🥰🥰🥰 love having you blog!! Good for you guys! So happy! I hope you love it! I would totally fan girl if I see you in San Antonio! 😱😱😱 either way I am happy you found your house and wish you guys nothing but tbt best!
Texas is a great choice! Y’all and millions of others are moving there. Plenty of room for all!
I knew it! Y’all are going to love it here!!
A Tati vlog? Yeeeees, thank you for this wonderful gift 👏🤩 Oh TX...I'd have said either Hawaii, TX or FL for some reason.  You'll have a lot of sunshine and a lot of space there, can't wait to see more 😍
I live in Texas…60 miles south of Houston. Welcome! Glad to have you.
Tati, I think you will absolutely love the south. There’s nothing like the kindness and hospitality of southern folks! I am biased because I’m a lifelong south Louisiana resident lol. But I think you will enjoy it so much. And the food down here is the best in my opinion. It’s worth it to make a drive to New Orleans just for the food. Again, I’m very biased but ya know 😂🤪  Best of luck on the move, and I hope you love it! Excited for you and your new chapter in life. You deserve all of life’s blessings. 💗
Yay congratulations on your new home;) I live in Plano, tx and love it. Cheers to all the new memories a fresh start has to offer. Xo
How gorgeous completely barefaced!!
I love the vlog style videos! And the last video you talked about moving in I had a feeling it as Texas! So happy for you to have a new bigger space!
Hi Tati, I’m have lived in Texas my whole life and we are so happy to have you here! Ps you need to try BlueBell IceCream it’s the best!
Yay! Born and raised in Houston, Texas. Food is awesome in Texas.
Good luck with Texas politics.
So excited for you!! this is going to be fun
Yasssss loved this!! Welcome to Texas! 💜
It's soo hard to move but u can do it-we moved from cinti Ohio to Israel!! Now that was a job.good luck!!!
Love this blog Tati! I can’t wait to see the new home!
Please do more vlogs ....
I had a feeling you were moving to Texas!! You have that Texas energy girl  💛💛🤠
I would absolutely love to see more of such videos!!
So 5 years ago I moved from south Florida to Louisiana for my career all by myself. I had never done anything like that before , it was scary. I packed whatever I could fit into my VW Passat and thats all I took with me. I can't believe its been 5 years already and so much has changed for the better for me. Its definitely an adventure, good luck!! You will love it!!!!
How exciting, Tati! I wish you both much happiness! I'm a Texan and I can't imagine never living in Texas. You'll love the people here as we are so friendly. Way to go to you and James!
I like this kind of format.  As someone who has been in Texas her whole life…. I hate that so many people are moving here… yet at the same time I am excited to see the tips for the incredibly highly heat and humidity.
love this lifestyle content im sooo excited for you
Welcome to Texas!!!
Yes please for more vlogs!!
Early gang 👀 Can't wait to see your new place ! Also ( I'm in the middle of watching 😅) I'm super curious what is the new location, ngl 😂🧡
Congrats on the move! I feel like you were the only other person to wear makeup here in the Seattle area 😂😂 so I’m kind of bummed you aren’t here anymore.
So exciting!! We'd absolutely love to follow you through this new chapter!
This is the first video I’ve watched of yours in a long time, more vlogs please!
Mad love for your vlogging skills! Amazing editing skills as well! Congrats on your move to TX. 😍😍😍

I did not expect you to say Texas. Wow! Welcome! I live in Austin and love it so much.
Welcome to beautiful Texas! My hubby, kids and I did the same, we moved from LA over a year ago to Dallas and can't be more in love. It was a great beginning for us too and I'm sure it'll be the same for you. My very best wishes 💐
Congratulations! This was so much fun watching !
Don’t tell me! You’re moving to Austin!
Loved this vlog! So excited for the both of you. I have watched your channel from the beginning and you’re my all time favorite. I am also moving from Southern California to Henderson Nevada and can’t wait to start a new chapter! Love to you♥️

Welcome to Texas, Tati! Moved from LA to Texas 3 years ago and couldn’t be happier!
Welcome to the GREAT STATE of TEXAS!!  Austin welcomes you if you ever want to come for a visit.  Are you moving to AUSTIN??? 😃🥰🤩🤠
Puka.. “Yeehaw” 🤭🤣
Love this. ❤️ hope you have a great move. So happy for you
Damn girl 😊!! You can definitely ROCK A VIDEO 💪👏😁👌👍!!!! ‘Nuff said 😎
You’ve got this Tati!!!  Joshua 1:9 “Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.”  Joshua 1:9 | NIV
I love this! I want to see what you're doing in Texas!
I personally want it all! Love the vlogs and love the makeup videos. I am turning 49 this year and need all the help I can get. So I say yes to all the things!! Cooking too!! I’m so close to being an empty nester and all of it gives me life! My husband and I have also considered Texas. My only drawback is my grandbaby that spent 8 months in the NICU and is finally home so it will be a while before we make any moves like that. But for now I can live through you!!! Love you so much keep it going!!
I loved this style of video 🥰
I really think Texas may be the place for you!!! Love you Tati ❤️
Texas is definitely the right move to make-  such a hot market right now. So excited for this new chapter! We def need home reno vlogs!
How cool! Have fun in Texas!
My second guess was tx
Love the Vlog! Definitely do more :)
Yaaa we here in Texas, say WELCOME!!!
Yeeey I am so happy for you guys!❤️ I am thinking of doing something like this myself, taking more care of myself, renovating and all.  So happy to be able to see you behind the glam camera.. cause we love the Glam guru but we love the person Tati more❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love the blog style! Keep doing it and best of luck on the move and new location. 😀
I  enjoyed this video. Would love to watch more vlogs.😊
I love the vlog! Welcome to Texas! I’ve been here for six years now! ❤️
I immediately texted my sisters you will be our neighbor. We are here in Louisiana. All three of us watch your videos. Love them.
Loved the vlogs Tati!
Love this!
That was sooooo goooood! Love it so much!
OMG how did I know you were gonna move to Texas, I had a feeling!! Well idk what part of Texas you'll be in but hopefully we run into each other one day😄😍 🐎🐄
Tati complains about spider issues in WA. Moves to the country in Texas. 🤣🤣🤣
I loved this type of content from you! It would be great to see some home renovation and decoration videos!
I live for this video format. Also wish you all the best in your new home 🏡 ❤️
Yesss!!!!! Please do more vlogs!!
Please keep vlog ❤️
Yes! Vlog more, please
Love the vlog style too. So so happy for your move!!
I love you, and love this type of video. I also live in Seattle, and love it. Summer in Seattle can’t be beat. Come on, say a few nice things about your childhood home town. 😇 I am interested to see how you will like the heat and humidity of Texas, along with hurricanes. I lived in Louisiana for 8 years, loved the people, but never got used to the weather. I was there during Katrina, and many other pretty strong hurricanes. I was very happy when we were able to move back. I wish you nothing but happiness, and joy on your new adventure. Looking forward to the videos. ❤️❤️
I LOVE THIS SO SO SO MUCH!!
Loved this! ♥️♥️♥️
Omg!! Congrats on the move!! I’m happy you seem safe again to share this type of content with us. Can’t wait to see more!!! ♥️♥️
Congrats to you n James!! New chapters are the best most terrifying things ever!! Can't wait to be a part of the new adventures in Texas with you guys!! Lots of love!!
I’m in Texas… what part? We are always welcoming to newbies in our girl gang ❤️ 🍷
Congratulations on the big move! We are finally parting ways with Washington as well come May to a place where we don’t know anybody either. What an empowering feeling, the unknown can be so scary yet so exciting. Safe travels 🤍 soak up all that sunshine!!
I don't understand why houses are so big in usa 😂😂 i would be so scared! I think the house you are leaving was good, it was a big change compared LA but who cares! Health it s the most important thing 😁 btw i am European 🇪🇺  houses are way different
I love this! Congratulations on your move! Can't wait to see more if you're willing to share 💕
TATI!!! I love the vlog!!! I can't wait for more! Its good to see James too! I'm so excited you're moving to Texas! Welcome to the south ❤️ from Mississippi

I am right there with you in this video!! We just got mutual acceptance on our dream home (bluff home with panoramic views of the puget sound, also a fixer upper!!). Today I start packing up my home to put it on the market… but first TATI!!
Ahh!! Welcome to Texas Tati! It’s hot but it’s beautiful here. So much love for you and James for moving down here. I made the move from O.C to Texas and I haven’t looked back.
So fun! Love this style of video from you!

Love the format and congrats on the move!!
When I tell you I RAN to buy that damn mirror
Yes, more vlogs please 🥰

Never would’ve guessed Texas, but now that I’m thinking about it, it makes sense!!!! Sending all of my love your way!!!

Sooooo funny ❤️
Agreed.   Bought a house just as the world shut down in March 2020. I never want to move again.   Thankfully it’s 900 feet from the beach and we love it here.   #foreverhome
Congratulations on the move. We moved from California to the South (not Texas) and we absolutely love it. Such a different life but so peaceful. We also don’t have family here but we’ve made great friends.  Wishing you luck in your new state.
I'm sooo excited you're moving to Texas!!! You'll love it here! Great state and great ppl. You'll have new friends before you know it. I'm in beautiful deep east Texas and it's wonderful. Good luck with your new home and adventures. ❤
Oh my goodness I’m so excited you and James moved to Texas!  You’re both going love it here!  Welcome, welcome, welcome! Truly enjoyed the vlog.  Eeeek!  So happy for you and this new chapter in your life. ❤️🙏🏽
Yay!!! More vlogs please

Guessed.Georgia..... Surprised Texas! Hope it works for Y'all.
Loved this! 🥰❤️🥰
Tati please send me some of your make up you don’t use .. 🙏🏼
I'm unemployed and just trying to be a selfpublished writer so I stay at home a lot and this video inspired me to do my nails for no reason. I'm trying to be better at pampering myself, having a skincare routine, checking that my hair is alive after all the bleaching. Sometimes I just write for 12 hours straight and then go to bed so I'm trying to pay more attention to myself. (I used to do full glam every day but now I only do a bit, just a little something for my online german classes). It's the quarantine effect XD Also I never wear a bra anymore. Anyway: Will love the vlogs and if you do cleaning even more because I love that. Just cooking, chilling, taking care of the home and yourself. It will be great.
Loved this vid:) and even though James doesn’t want to be on camera anymore, it was nice to hear interactions with the two of you again ☺️
Vlog was great. Can’t wait to see the new place
LOVELOVELOVE the vlogs!
Well you will love the Spiders in Texas. Also the scorpions. :) Welcome to Texas. I was born and raised here. It has pros and cons. I am not sure if you have experienced a Texas summer yet.
All the best things for you Tati!! 🦋 I'm so excited for you!
Your addiction to Outshine popsicles is completely relatable to me. I love them so much. I'm so happy for you and James and your new start! 💕💕
Tati! I loved this vlog style! So happy for y'all and your next adventure. Also super happy to hear youre moving to my homeland!!! Such an amazing state full of awesome opportunity! 🤠
Yay! I love when you vlog. Please do it more! Love you beautiful 💕
My skin isn’t sensitive at all but that elf putty bronzer broke me pout with the worst break out ever ! It looked like cystic acne everywhere I put that stuff . Horrible
Ive been waiting for these types of videos from you for years. So excited!!!!
All the best in the new house ❤️❤️
You will love Texas. I’m in KY and have friends in Texas. Super friendly ppl
Yay!  Welcome to Texas!! You’ll love it!
Love it, Love the Video & Hi f/ OKC!  You’ll love it, I mean Our Football is Better. Haha, 🥰😘
I live in Texas and we didn’t know anyone when we moved here! Welcome!!
i looooove moving vlogs pls do the part 2 tati
Congrats on the new place. I loved the blog style ❤️😁
I recently visited Texas for the first time and it was absolutely beautiful ❤️ wishing you the best of luck for your new journey ❤️
i love your vlogs!!! 😍
Tati, its so beautiful to see you like this! Loooove this Vlog Situation!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
Texas welcomes you with open arms 🤗 we have lots to offer and there’s some of every climate/terrain hah
I live in Texas,  you will love it!!!!
Well this is exciting! I want to move too. House prices in Utah are SOOO expensive right now! But if we sold and moved to a cheaper area, we could get a huge house with a huge plot of land. It's so tempting to me. But I'll just live vicariously through you. Please, keep up the vlogs!
I'm for this content, as well as the makeup! Looking forward to part two!
Tati keep doing you!  I love that you and James are together! Texas. Yes.  I’d love to move there or to Florida! God bless!
YES!!!! Please do more vlogs! I am so happy for you! Congratulation on the new house!
I loved this format Tati! I love behind the scenes and the realness of it all, keeping doing you! 🥰
I've watched u for so long & I can see how happy u are now! I'm excited for yall & wish yall all the blessings!!! Honestly I love everything u do 💜 we love u guys
We love a home and lifestyle vlogger. I’m looking forward to the new place and the new content!
I have to be honest, I am a bit shocked you are moving to Texas with the attack on women's reproductive rights there and your struggles. They are literally putting women in jail for having miscarriages or a stillbirth and incentivizing rape and incest. Most people I know are terrified and leaving. Hope you stay safe.....
I knew you were going to say Texas!
Yay! I can't wait to see your adventures.
Welcome to our beautiful State of Texas!!! So happy to have beautiful souls coming. Loving this format!! Keep doing it!!! Let's keep Texas beautiful!! Remember Don't mess with Texas 😅🥰❤
Love this!! Congratulations, excited for you two!!❤
I LOVE LOVE LOVE THE VLOG STYLE. we are getting to know you better yahhhhhhhh
We love this 💕🙌🏻
Fun times ahead! Texas will be awesome 🌞 congrats😎  We're struck in Seattle 2 more years 😫 (youngest graduates Bellevue H.S. in 2024) I don't care where we live 🤣 I just want sunshine 😎 Pleases vlog all about renovations and future garden 💚

YYAAAASSSS!!! Come on down girl!! You will love the great free state of Texas!!  (Bring extra moisturizer and sunscreen 🤣)
Yay I knew it was Texas. I live there. 💙

Welcome to Texas, Tati! I made the move and left my family and everyone I loved three years ago. I have grown so much as a person learning to do things on my own! I hope your new adventure brings you more joy and bliss than you could imagine! 💕

You are going to LOVE true southern hospitality Tati!!!
Yay!!!! Welcome to Texas!!!!!!
I KNEW IT! My bet was either Texas or Arizona, leaning on Texas but hoping for Arizona because that’s where I live so how cool would that be but Texas is cool too I guess. Yay for this new style and even more yay for the new journey! 😍
Omg 😱 yessssssss welcome to Texas ❤️❣️🙌 I live in Tool Tx 👏🤣👏🤣 I’m proud of you for being true to your journey ✅💯👏 absolutely dream of hugging you one day hopefully and say thank you for everything you do ❣️❣️❣️❣️

Vlogs are where it's at. It's what I mostly watch now since 2020.
I loved this video Tati ! Love you ! God bless can’t wait to see your new setting !!!!! Don’t keep us waiting for long ! Lol
Love this new chapter of your life it makes me so excited for you and your future family🥰
Welcome to Texas!
I love the vlogs!!!!!! I would love for you to keep them coming!!!!
It’s funny how when I read the title of your video I was like watch her move to Texas lol I’m from Houston Texas and I would not picture me living anywhere else.
loving this vlog style!! also home renovation and stuff like that is my favorite so i'd definitely like to follow along with the move and reno's and such
Yes! Loving this format as much as your regular videos. I'm in the process of moving too. It's exhausting. Congratulations and best wishes in the new place ❤️🏡
Wishing you & James many blessings on this newest adventure xoxo 💜🌻
Immediate Like 🥰🙏🏽
Oh, welcome to Texas or Howdy! Austin area, of course? Maybe I will see you in a cafe one day.
This was so fun!!! So excited for you guys on your new move! I was cracking up at tired Tati wanting all the popsicles 😂
Texas welcomes y'all with open arms!
I can tell you are excited!!!   Happy day🤩🍀 Being in Southern Utah / 300+  sunny days and no humidity.  I get the reason to move ❤️
YAY!! Welcome to Texas!!! I know you'll love it here.
SQUEEEEEEEEEEE!!  I moved back to Texas from East Side Seattle area. I absolutely LOVE IT. I choose the small town in the Piney Woods area and my house is literally less than a mile from the lake!
Congratulations!!! So excited for you both. My mind just pinged about Texas abortion laws and I'm just going to pray that you have perfect healthy pregnancies. I just want you to have the best health care. ❤️
Congratulations on your new move! Your new home! If I wasn’t in New Mexico, Texas is where I’d be. We’ll be state neighbors!!!
So happy for you, I think Texas would be a great move for you- I’ve never been but I hear people love it❤️❤️🥰Congratulations to both of you🥰
Be sure to get Puka on heart worm regimen. When my son moved to Austin from Oregon the vet told him his little dog needed to get on heart worm prevention in Texas.😻😸 😘
I love whatever you post!! I’m so excited for you guys and wish you the best!!
Congrats Tati! I has a feeling you were headed to Texas 😊 I left Seattle area for Oklahoma a couple years ago and we love the extra space! I hope you are getting settled in okay💕
Love the vlog style. Can't wait to see the new home and beauty space. Best of luck 💕
Seeing & hearing James with Tati,  even just a little, makes the world a fraction more "normal" - thanks James 🙂 Fifteen years ago my husband &  I made the decision to leave our city life behind and it was the best thing we could've done. Now the horses I see in my backyard are mine and I can truly 'disconnect' to find quiet in the madness. Godspeed on your travels!
Good luck with your move!! 💜 I actually think it made sense that you didn't do a house tour until now bc another youtuber said she doesn't want to do a full walk-through house tour for safety reasons! That kind of house tour basically gives the whole internet a blueprint of your home! Safety first always💕💕
May God bless your new home and new chapter ❣
Congrats!!!
Love this format Tati! I pray you are loving Texas, and all the wide open spaces
And for sure I love the Vid!!!!
Damn I really like vlogger Tati!
Welcome to Texas! The politics suck BUT Texas can be wonderful and the land and people can be wonderful. I'm in Wylie outside DFW and if you ever need suggestions or best kept secrets... there are many of us who would happily volunteer suggestions 😊
my guess was arizona for some reason but i wasn’t far off by it being a completely different climate. congratulations!! i hope this journey makes you and your family happy
I like the vlogs and seeing you start a new chapter
Yes love the vlogs.  Wishing you good vibes on your journey. 🙏🙏
My dog gets nervous when she sees us packing too🤣 Kinda odd since she always goes with us but she is extremely high anxiety 😳
Welcome to Texas!! Loved this style of video
i love this SO MUCH! please more of this content. also hope you ate that popsicle xoxo
Welcome to Texas! Love the Vlogs. Many Blessings in your new journey!
Everybody is moving to Texas! D: I want to move to Texas too!!!!
❤❤
I LOVE this Tati, more VLOGS please!!!!! You know that we are right here with you.
We want vlogs 😊
💯 ❤️ this vlog! So happy for you to be starting a new chapter and thank you for taking us along with you. Peace & light! ✌️
I live in between Fort Worth and Abilene, unfortunately right in the middle of where all the fires are going on right now. Please pray for the folks out here, some are losing everything. So far it has stayed away from our little town. But no matter what, Texas is the very best place to live in the world! We are the friendliest people you will ever meet. My husband and I have a 100 yr old historical house that we are working on as we go. It's hard work, but fun and exciting and fulfilling and will be for y'all too. I have spent most of my life training horses for a living, so if you need any help, let me know. I was just telling my husband that someone should do a beauty channel for ranch/farm/outdoor women! There are a lot of us, it's an untapped goldmine!!!  Best of luck to all that you do, Tati! Remember that we love you.
I called it!!! Yay!!!! Welcome to Texas!!
Oh congrats on the move and Texas Yippy! Hope you love it there. ❤️
Loving vlogging Tati!!   I wish you all the luck on your move and fresh start! I hope you achieve everything you're wanting to and more ❤🦋
I’m excited for it all 🤩  Even for the new style of videos
Yessss we like the vlogging format ✅💯 we want more !!!!
Us Texans welcome you!!🥰
Yes yes.. more videos like this please 👍👍
My guess was Texas!
Good Luck in your house move Tati xxx
Tati you're my neighbor now ! Sending love from NM and I can't wait for more vlogs
I loved watching you vlogging!! Congratulations on the new beginning!! ❤️❤️
This is one of my favorite videos you've ever made. I'm so happy for you & proud of you for making this move and starting a new journey with your love. I wish you three the best of luck in your new home, and you'll absolutely love Texas.. at least I did when vacationing there 😁❤ So happy for you girl!!!
Yes!!! Packing and moving is the best. I love it.  Texas will be great!
Congratulations 🍾🎊🎈🎉!!!!!!! Best wishes to you and James!!!!!
My beloved Tati, I LOVE that you are filming with your phone or lower res camera. In the studio when you are bare faced, you are unfinished, but you are also in the studio: high lights, hi def camera, bounce cards, etc. That is NOT the real you, that's the unfinished camera you. But just on your camera, in the natural light of your apartment, with no makeup, you are beautiful. Your skin looks beautiful. You are age appropriate (that's a good thing) and you should do more of these. Not to undo your brand, but to normalize looking normal. Good luck and godspeed.
Okay 1. Love the vlogging! I love getting a glimpse into your life again! I definitely understand you feeling not safe enough to let us in but this glimpse is beautiful! I love it and I pray God bless you and James so much into your next home and that Jesus would consume you guys with his perfect peace ❤️
Thanks for listing all the makeup products, but what was that gorgeous lipstick? I live in Idaho and when we moved from Boise to Meridian, literally next door city, my five cats we're freaking out!! They hid under a recliner for days until their blanket was unpacked. Poor little Puca! Moving makes our babies so anxious. Let alone us. Anyway, I hope the new move and city make you feel at ease and amazing!! 💜💙
Love the video!! Love vlog too!! Excited for your new journey!!!
Tati, i just enjoy ur journey. This kind of video is lit and enjoyable. I love how ure embracing the process and take us with u. What a privilege to be ur viewer. Sending love from Indonesia.
You just seem so much happier and we have the old Tati back!!! Wishing you all nothing but amazing things ! ❤️
Congrats on the move! Can’t wait to see the new spaces ;)) xoxo
Ahhh I’m in Texas!! I hope we see you around 🥰 you’ll love it!
Love that you’re letting us be a part of your journey! So excited for you!
Yeh! Texas! I assumed it. Wish you al the BEST for your new capture! Hope you will find your ring!!!! ♥️

Howdy from Texas!! So excited you're moving here. I'm a born and raised Texan, it's a great place to find some peace and space. Looking forward to seeing you explore and fall in love with the state. ❤️  Also, your uploads will finally be in my time zone, Yayyyy!!!!
Best wishes 💜🖤✌️
We need more Tati vlogs!! ❤️
Love this sooo much!!!
Welcome to Texas!!!
Oh Tati trust me when I say you got some serious FANS down here in Tejas!! WELCOME TO TEXAS!!! If by any chance you ever do a meet and greet here me and my friends who are also your friends would try to be first in line!! Congratulations on your new home!!!!
I totally feel you. I have 10 days to move my entire house into my parents home. My parents passed away last year & their house still has everything in it. So I'm not even moving into an empty space. So like going through & moving 2 homes in 10 days.  STRESS!!
Congratulations Tati on embarking a new chapter to the lovely red state of Texas! I’m based in NYC and plan to retire in a year or two. I have a few places in mind that I am thinking about moving to further south and to be closer to my grandkids. Your piano is gorgeous! Nothing like starting over and everything anew. Forward and onwards indeed! How exciting! ❤️❤️ Puka is so adorable 🥰
More vlogs yes 🥰
My homestate!!! I'm a proud Texan and so excited for you guys!
I love vlogs these days. I think we've all grown and want to see more than makeup from our favorite creators. I personally would love to see some of the home reno process too.
Congrats on your move!!!
I had 3 guesses. Florida, texas o nevada 🤣🤣🤣🤣
LOVE the format! Welcome to Texas! I moved here 22 years ago!
Love this for you so much!! So excited to go on this adventure with you!! I love this blog style video too! Wish you all the luck and safe travels!! 💜
Hey Tati! I'm also moving to Texas 🎉
Tati looks so much younger barefaced. I think that applies to me too. Every time I put make-up on, I gain 10 years.
You seem so happy Tati! I'm so happy for you and excited for your new adventure! :) <3
LOVE this kind of content from you and congratulations on your new home and moving to Texas, so excited for you both, and cant wait for updates ❤
Love the new content. I just hope your not going to Northern Texas. I say this because I made the move from WA to Texas back in 2015 and I only lasted 18 months. The people where terrible and the TORNADOES where TERRIFYING!
Please never stop vlogging! Hope your new journey makes you the happiest 😊
More vlogs! More vlogs! More vlogs!
I’m so happy for you and love this Tati content ❤️
God Bless Texas 😉 I'm excited for you!
❤❤❤❤ this blog warmed my heart 😭 it shows is possible to fight through hard times. Im happy to see you more happy and healthier
I love that you share this things with us. It doesnt have to be super private details. Thats not the point. But i feel like we are going with you, Just being there for support if needed. We are all starting to grow into this New tati chapter. So lets do it together! Love from Argentina!!!!
I’m so excited and happy for you and your fresh start!!!!! It’s time for a better, bigger Tati!!!!!! 💗💗💗💗
Loving this! Keep it up. As long as you are comfortable ☺️ As a private person myself I get this kind of sharing and vulnerability is hard
Love the vlog style!!
Ok, so this was a breath of fresh air!🙂 Yes, we (and when I say WE I mean ME) want to see all things heavily makeup!! But also, this format you speak of is quite nice, and gives us just enough glimpse into the Tati Beyond The Makeup. Keep up the great work, AND many beautiful BLESSINGS to y'all in your new, hopefully forever home.💯🤗🙏😇💖
I am here for vlogging Tati! And I am here for lifestyle Tati!! 😊
Love this from you Tati. Love seeing some vlog footage.  Please do decor vlogs for your new place too. Would love that.  X
Love, love, love the vlog style video!! Excited for the new Texas Tati! 💜

Congratulations! Hope you end up in Houston!
Welcome to Texas!
Can't wait to see more of this! Hope everything goes well
Welcome to Texas! 🤠
SO EXCITING!! Loved This Video..!!!!
so excited for you, and bring on the vlogs, I love everything you do!
I’m still so heartbroken that you lost your wedding ring. I hope it turns up randomly in Texas for you. Xx
We are a military family. I’ve moved 13 times in 22 years of marriage. Only once have we lived within two hours of family. Let me tell you, the stress is real, but you can do this! I’m excited for you and your journey stepping out of your comfort zone. God speed!
I’m loving this vlog style!!!
This Texan welcomes you!!!!!! Best wishes to you and your family!!!!!!😍
So happy for you both.  Texas and Florida, two of the best states to reside in.  Wishing you plenty of sleep. and, yes, I loved the video format.😊❤️💕
Keep Texas Red 🇺🇸
Welcome to Texas!! This is so exciting! Texas is best! So excited for you guys! That was my guess 😊
LOVE THE VLOGS AND WANT MORE!!!!  So excited for you and James and may God bless you both. Again, 99.9% of your videos are about makeup and that's okay, but I love vlogs based on home life such as renovations, decor, cooking, etc. I'm so excited!!!
I like the vlogs, they're refreshing 😌
It just dawned on me that James sounds like Keanu reeves 🤭😌
Love this vlog style videos.  I'm enjoy watching you trought the moving process. ❤❤❤😘
Does this mean we are getting another Mr. Kate beauty studio build🤩
Congrats on your move!!!

I like the vlog, it was a really nice change/ update.  Definitely do more.
Texan here....now you'll have to vlog your makeup adventures (this summer) in 6000% Texas humidity and 110 degree weather. Trust me when I say it's a battle like no other. Lol.

Tati! Your vlogs are everything!
You should so hook up with graveyard girl while in Texas. She is like you, a beautiful more private soul without all the need to be a public figure
Moving sucks.  I was thinking about buying a new house and I still might but ughhh moving is so horrible and such a nightmare 😫.  Congratulations on your new home though.
Loved this video. So excited for you to move to my state. You’re going to loooooovvvee Texas❤️❤️❤️

Please keep posting updates like this, I am moving right now too and could use the motivation! 💕
Thank you so much for sharing your life with us. You have truly become my virtual friend throughout all these yrs. Have been a sub since you were in your apt and truly feel like we've all grown and succeeded together. Sending you and yours much love, hugs and prayers ❤️❤️❤️
I wish you luck and happiness in your move.  Prayers for you and James. My husband and I went through a very rough patch in our early marriage but came through it better than ever and I love him more now than I ever did.  Enjoy your new location and find yourself a lovely church family to connect with.  God's with you and always listening <3
When you said you needed sun I knew it was gonna be either my sunshine state of FL or somewhere in the south, especially when you said you wanted land. That's so exciting, I'm happy for you and James. I had to edit my comment to include that it's a definite yes on more vlogs. 💜
Love your vlog! You seem So happy and at peace  Super happy for you and James!! And puka too ❤️
I’m so happy for your new adventure Tati! I grew up in Texas…beautiful sunsets…wonderful people. You will be right at home in no time. My best to you during your move!  ❤️❤️
This format is great and I would love to see more like this! Congratulations, and I hope you and James find all you're hoping for in Texas!
I knew it was Texas!! Welcome to my state!
This is very sentimental for me because this is my last week in NJ we will be moving to San Antonio texas and the bigger part of me is over the moon exited but sometimes you get this overwhelmed feeling and just anxiety of the change but hearing you and your mindset it helps so much! Change is amazing and necessary 👏🏽⭐️
I love the vlog and older format as well! Cheers to new beginnings!! Sending you lots of love and positive vibes.
10:59 I remember that tweet!! And I'm so happy for you and James that it's finally come true 💖
I knew it!! You are gonna love TX..we are a different kind of people..in a good way..lol
This format is so fun! Very exciting prospects eh, I bet you'll love the space and nature, watching birds feed, build nests and grow, and seeing other wildlife wander, it's calming. When I get lonely here, I put on a podcast, radioshow, yt video, something I've known for a while, to make me feel like I'm with friends. Hugs!
So into this content Tati ! Hope you ate that fourth popsicle
Girl.   I’d watch a creamed corn review if you posted it!!! Love you!  Prayers to you and fam.   Moving sucks!!! Get rest!
I’m so happy for you, Tati! I hope this next chapter in your life is the best one yet!
Just remember.... don't California Texas.
Congrats on your move! On to better things!
I love seeing your journey!  Excited for the new chapter for you and James! :)
Loved the format of the video.  Best wishes in Texas, great state to live in!  If I was moving again, it would be Texas or Florida.
Such a fun video! Would love to see more vlogs.
Wishing you both peace and happiness in your new home.
Whats the tittle of the song?
Congrats on your new move!!! My husband & I dream about moving to Texas!! ☀️😁🥰😘
This is super exciting!!! I know plenty of people in Texas and they absolutely love it!!!!
I’m beyond excited for you and your new journey!!!! May you be blessed in every way 💜
Any vlog by you is A+ content. You’re so relatable and humble I respect you so much. I live in Oklahoma and I’m so excited your coming to the Midwest. You’ll live it out here. My guess is you’re going to Austin. Austin would fit you perfectly.
💗💗💗

Girl I thought you was Millie bobby brown in the thumbnail
Yay! I had a feeling it’d be Texas. Wishing you happiness!
I’m in love with this new video style 💜 love you Tati!!!
How exciting! My guess was for Texas ☺️
Tati "needing to become floor" for her mental health is something I didn't know I needed in my life, and reading back my sentence, it sounds like it's mean, I swear that it isn't. Just thank you for being so relatable, truly. ❤
Yes! Loving the vlog idea! ❤️
Enjoy Tati and james thinking of you both , enjoy your new home , good luck love liz from uk 🇬🇧 x oh yes keep up with the vlogs ! sweet dreams x
You will LOVE Texas!! We are so awesome here!

I love this for you guys!!! I can’t wait to see Tati in Texas! You still found a way to get ready with us! I love it! Can’t wait to see your new beauty room!
Congratulations Tati, love seeing you smile again 💜
Congratulations on your new adventure. I have always admired you and viewed you as a role model for your strength, bravery, and creativity. I’m not sure that I’ve ever left a comment but I’ve been watching your videos for about eight years. You helped get me through recovery from two hip replacements. I was thrilled when you came back to YouTube, you provide a ton of education and entertainment, deserve all of the wonderful success that you have had. And even more than that, you have come back from terrible and distressing circumstances with grace and a fantastic attitude. Here’s to you and James!
LOVE VLOGS!!!! So happy for you!
I figured it was Texas... it fits with the exodus. I have seen SO MANY more WA, OR, and CA license plates in the last few years! I moved to Texas from Washington back in 2010. So, welcome to the dark side; we've got freedom.😉
I was watching this and got a really good vibe, like this is going to be a great move for you, and looked at the clock and it was 11: 11. Issa sign, girl! Good luck with the move 🍀
tell james we miss him! also looking forward to seeing how life is like in texas!
I might be more excited for you to be getting back into music than anything else!
You are the best vlogger!I loved it ❤
I hope these behind the scenes of her life vlogs keep up! Yes to renovating content
We did the same thing - NY to FL over the summer and I cannot tell you how better off we are. It definitely sucks missing everyone but we feel so at peace here! Wishing you guys all the best on the move
So excited for your guys new chapter. Love this style too your always amazing and such a joy.
Cant wait to see you in the saddle 🐎 Best of luck! 🌻🌻🌻
Welcome to Texas. Fort Worth is fantastic.
LOVE this😁nice change.
Yay! I love this format!! My husband and kids sold our home when my husband’s father died from cancer almost a year ago. We put our house into storage and moved in with my husband’s mother. I dream of sleeping in my own bed again. And having my own kitchen…. Hopefully we’ll get there soon. But she comes first right now and helping her…..and I too miss my heels. In storage 🥹
MORE VLOGSSSSS ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Good for you! Enjoy the change. I love Texas, and wish you a successful move.
You’ll love Texas. My sister is in Dallas and loves it. I live in Reno and the market here is so bad as well.  Super expensive houses with no yard.  I’m so excited to follow this new journey.
Please do a part 2 ! I love this format. Wishing you both all the happiness in the world. Texas is  lucky to have you guys. 💕💕
I lived in Texas most of my life, and my love for the state is enormous. I hope you find so much happiness and peace within this new chapter💛💛

Love the Tati vlogs!! Definitely vote for more vlogs and behind the scene content.  Would love to see the reno process too
Welcome to Texas! I moved to south central Texas almost 2 years ago and have loved it so much!!
I kinda wish her wedding ring would magically re-appear in her new house, getting goosebumps just thinking about it
OMG!!!! Welcome to Texas!!! It’s a great state to live. I had a feeling it was either Texas or Florida.
We are renovating as well- moving to my husband's family's farm up in north GA...  I can't wait to get away from the hustle bustle of Atlanta!  I'm going to have some chickens and alpacas plus a little donkey.  If you had told me I'd be living on a farm 10 years ago I would've laughed!  I can'twait!  I graduated from the University of Texas- it's a wonderful state; but very HOT!
This. 100% Real Tati. This is what I want to see.  Also Costco next time for those totes, they're multipack and cheaper
Do we get to see Taylor again?
I’m here for it!! I’m completely into lifestyle, makeup is great but it’s nice to see other things. Beauty is more than our faces so I really hope that you do more videos like this!!
Welcome to the Lone Start State! So happy to know you are happy with your move! Texas is going to be a change but we are friendly for the most part I promise ❤️
LOVED this video ✨✨
Please for vlogs!! 🤍🤍
I am so happy for you!!! I know that this move will do great this for you and James!!! If you do decide it's not quite right in Texas, try Oklahoma, it's like Texas only better! 😅🥰
Congrats and good luck!
Welcome to Texas!! So happy for you! You’ll love it here! ♥️🎉
Ah! Welcome to Texas! Happy to have you here!
I'm so excited about sharing this new chapter with you guys.  Thank you for being so supportive! xo's ~ Tati
Awww Tati! Welcome to the south! ❤️ I’ll be your bff!! 👯‍♀️ lol
I would like part II. Happy for you and James for moving
Aloha from Houston Texas! Welcome to TEXAS!!🤙🇨🇦🇺🇸 Y'all are going to like Whataburger and Chic fil A!🤙
I loved this! I can't wait to see more vlogs and congrats on the move! ❤️❤️
The fact that Tyler Wynn was in Seattle and now might be moving to Austin, and now you're moving to TX is so funny to me lol.
Super enjoyed this!
I used comforters and towels to pack my wall art. It works just as well as bubble wrap when it comes down to it. Good luck with your move.  Dont let it get to you. The finished product will be amazing just like you!!
please DON’T stop vlogging!!!
Welcome to Texas Tati!
Tati please more vlogs.
I’ve waited for years for you to start vlogging 😂🎉 so so happy right now !
Thank you for bringing us into your world and showing us the behind the scenes view of your life! I love it!  Congratulations on this new chapter! 🙌🏼🎉🦋
Texas is great! Louisiana here, but welcome to the south you will LOVE IT!!!! CONGRATS
Although I live in small town Kentucky right now and I love it but I am from Beaumont Texas and I go to see my mom a lot. And I miss Texas so much there are parts of Texas that are so beautiful and peaceful
I would be obsessed with more vlogs ♥️ can’t wait to see your new home and I’m so excited for you!
More vlogs please. We are a little bit tired with make up nowadays.
Loved the video and can't wait for more moving content! 💜 Moving to a totally new place can be scary but can also be so freeing and such an amazing chance to introduce yourself to new people as a person you'd like to be seen as and not as the person you think everyone already think you are if you get what I'm trying to say here 😄 Good luck with everything, may Texas be good for your little family 😘
Welcome to Texas!
Love this Vlog - when you said you were moving the very first place that crossed my mind was Texas!!
Tati, I’m not usually a commenter but I just have to tell you that this video and a lot of your recent videos have so perfectly demonstrated the way someone should handle change. You’re doing amazing combating all of these things and I hope to duplicate it in my life because you look so graceful and beautiful while you handle the hard stuff!!
Your gonna love Texas the sun 🌞 shines almost daily but than there's still the feeling of all 4 seasons..... well at least where I'm at in Dallas area but moving in 2 months to Austin area . the thunderstorm ⛈ are amazing!  moved here after living in Oregon 40 yrs🥵 SO HAPPY FOR YOU 😍❤️
Yes!!!  Welcome to Texas!!
Taylor and Tati, from Seattle to TEXAS!! This is wonderful content. It was so nice to see Pooka again. And I cried while Tati packed. She’s been through so much and deserves all the good things.
Wowwww!! Its so therapeutic😍😍😍😍😍
I Just looove ur personality so much! This vlog is great
VLOGING TATI?! This was magical! Wishing you and James a safe trip down to Texas and many blessings for the new home! There's something so refreshing about a new space and a fresh start!!
I'd love to shoo at the Goodwill Tati donates too lol I know, she's probably an ebay or poshmark seller
Loved this vlog! It was so cool 🤍 Congratulations on the move 🎉
may ur new place be filled with blessing and happy moments
Yay! You did it, all the best and I hope you like your new home 💗
Good luck, good vibes, and prayers! 🙏🏼❤️🙏🏼
I never expected you to pick Texas but I don’t blame you. I was born and raised in a California city but I’ve always been a country girl at heart. I met my Texan husband online so many years ago and eventually dated, met, and got married (going on 10 years married). I only got to live in Texas for a little while before moving back to California. But we have always dreamed of going back to Texas and settling in the country ☺️ A girl can certainly dream and make it happen ✨
Oohoo! I ended up moving from California to here now too! 7 years ago. Best decision ever! Congratulations
Omg i hope the wedding ring turns up somehow. 🥺
I’m a natural born Texan. Hope you enjoy your new home here. If you’re a gardener, it’s heaven here.
Best of luck to you and your family on your big adventure! Your heart seems lighter - bless. New memories on the horizon. 💕
I knew it was TX! yay welcome to the south
Looove vlogs like this! I used to love the half-vlog half-review videos, and I’m loving full vlogs too. 😊
So excited for you Tati! I love the vlog format as well as the tutorials/reviews.

You are moving exactly where I would like to move but I am concerned about the big bugs, please let me know how that goes because big bugs and I do not get along and I won’t move somewhere where the bugs are huge LOL I’m laughing but totally serious.

Welcome to Texas!!! Born and raised here and have loved every minute of it!! I live north of Dallas in Denton. Depends on where you live cause Texas is just so different in every corner..... but either way WELCOME!!!
Yup.. more vlogs
Welcome to Texas! Texas is a whole other country, but that is the good thing about it!! I do hope you find your wedding ring!! I think about it every time I watch one of your videos.  I really hope it turns up somewhere. When my mom passed away, we thought she had lost her original wedding ring, but I found it in a very small drawer on a sort of jewelry box she had on her dresser.  So, things turn up in places where you least expect them to.
Love this format from you! And I’m crazy excited for you and this new journey!!! Can’t wait to see what you share with us about your renovations and your new life in Texas!! 🎉
Omg congrats to you and your little family ♥️♥️ I agree with y’all #blessings to you both ♥️♥️🥰
yay welcome to texas!
Girlllll!!!! I can’t wait for y’all to love Texas! I’m also excited to see you experience the Texas heat and fall in love with H-E-B❤️
Loved the vlog!
The puka yeehaw killed me! 😂 my husband and I are moving to Florida for his job in 2 weeks and I’m nervous! Love that we are both headed on a similar journey together!

Welcome to Texas! We are happy to have you❤️
Woo hoo. I’m so happy for you. TX will be good.  Stay True!!!  Hugs💜💜💜💜
Congratulations!! Such an exciting time for you. Love the vlog style and may I also share that we miss James!! ❤️

Congrats from Quanah, Texas!!!!! You will love it here.
I love the vlog
You go girl💖 you only have one life, so do you 😍 I’m sending you positive and happy vibes
Also, just want to say I’m so so sad you no longer sell your palette, my toddler spilled his milk all over mine and I had to throw it out. It was easily my favorite palette too. After having kids I lost my drive to do makeup but your palette was the one I kept for those “just in case” moments lol I almost donated him. 😂
Oh my gosh that is so wonderful that you are starting fresh in Texas!! Hubby and I are from rural Canada and have spent time in Texas, we love how friendly the people in Texas are!! The vlog was as fun, do more💕🥰
Congratulations on your move! I can't watch now because I'm at work but I can't wait to watch this when I get home. So happy for you guys! ❤️
I’m moving this week too! The perfect motivation I needed :) fabulous as always!
Hell yeah girl. WELCOME TO TEXAS
We need MORE VLOGS and more uploads.. please..i miss my 5 days of Tati.. PLEASE 💚💚
Yes yes! Love this new format I can’t wait to see more!!❤️❤️
I am so excited for you! I grew up in the Austin area and it was truly such a great environment, Texas just has that cozy friendly feel wherever you look!
What part of Texas? I feel like you are Dallas vibes!
Keep the vlogs coming I love this new content Tati!!
Happy to have you call Texas home. ☺️ Born & raised here and I can’t imagine living anywhere else. Also, it’s such a blessing to see you be fully you again. ❤️
Welcome to Texas!  OMG so excited.
I adore the vlog style!!! Awesome video!!!!
So happy for you, James AND Puka too! Oddly satisfying to see all the makeup packed up.
So happy for you Tati welcome to Texas, my home.
So excited for a Tati vlog. Moving vlogs are some of my favorite to watch. Can't wait to see your new adventures unfold. 🥰
Love this style video x
It’s so funny. I just knew it was Texas as soon as you announced that you were moving. Everyone seems to be moving to Texas, Florida or Atlanta.  Best wishes on your move.
Congratulations Tati! I live in Texas too! Welcome to Texas!
I wish Californians would quit moving east and southeast.  It is driving up prices for regular folks.  It's the only time that I actually want to enforce borders.  Lol.
Happy to have someone else join our sunshine state! I hope you enjoy living here ❤️
Drooling all over your piano 🤤
Congratulations, Tati!! So happy for you!
Tati!!!! I live in Texas!!!! I’ll be your friend!!!! 💜
Wishing you both a happy new life.
My stepmom owes me $20. I bet her you were moving here. EVERYONE IS MOVING TO TEXAS!
Saw the cowboy boots from Home Depot clip - knew it was TEXAS!! Congrats!!
I live in Texas and I can't help wanting to become besties with you! Lol
So excited to keep you company in this season Tati! Congratulations 🎉
Tati, Texas?!?!? Wohooooo, we can’t wait to have you and James!!  Amazing food, gorgeous weather, and unmatched southern hospitality await you! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I'm in Texas! You'll love it!
So cute! So ready for you! Great job packing! Yeehaw!
Welcome to Texas!
Wooo Hooo!!
Woohooo!!! Texas ♥️♥️ Congratulations guys. I love you angel.    Yesssss do home renovations as well. You’ll love it. Do part 2 ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Wowowow I am all for these types of videos!! Would love to see your new home 😍 so happy you both are so so happy 💕
This is exactly what I love to see from you, your carefree self and looking so happy. Here’s to the next adventure!
OH MY GOSH!!!! Welcome to TEXAS!!! I’m from the northern suburb of Houston called The Woodlands!!! I hope you love our great state!!!!!
For  a couple starting from scratch can be a beautiful adventure. 🙌🙌🙌❤️
Congratulations 🍾
So excited to hear about your new adventures in Texas!!!! 🥰
I'm not cheating and reading comments until i get to the part where you announce your new home.... But I hope it's Florida for some reason!!! I just feel like the sunshine state would serve you well, and while I wouldn't recommend Florida for many people, you're a city gal to me. So now let's see how far off I am 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I love the vlog style videos and I am so excited for this next chapter for you! You are more than makeup and it is so interesting to see a different side of that life.
This new start is looking amazing on you! I love vlogs, I like seeing you in a different way. Hope this new move brings you tons of happiness ❤
My guess is she moved to Florida or Texas. Idk why, that's just my guess!
Travelvlog? Well, lifevlog actually. Nice. 😊
are you telling me that i might have a chance in meeting you!? you are the reason why i love makeup so much!❤️ i love you and i’m so happy for you and proud of you❤️
Of course when I leave Texas you go! Lol congratulations
Texas have the nicest people!!!  I'm kinda bias. Texas is burning and everyone is coming together to help each other out ❤️❤️❤️
TEXAS!! YAY! WELCOME! Emily from Houston
YASSSA TATI I LUVE IN FORT WORTH YOU WILL LOVE IT HERE!!

Welcome to the Lone Star state!!! I can't wait to see you on this journey!!!❤️❤️

Love you tati! I missed your vlogs so much!!
We are moving to Texas in June from California. We are so excited and I hope you enjoy it, and I hope we do too. ❤️
I know James doesn't want to be on camera anymore but please let him know we care & miss him.
Aww, best of luck to you in your new home Tati. I'm loving the background music to your makeup application xxxx
Welcome to Texas Tati!
Yes, would definitely love more vlogs 😊.
YES TATI! I am loving this side of you 🥰
Your "bare faced" look is so beautiful I honestly didn't even notice. If mine looked that good "sans makeup' I'd not mind if I had to run out real quick not done up. Lol
So excited for you!!! Welcome to Texas!!
I loved this vlog style! Also loved that there was a bit of makeup thrown in! Will definately be looking for those pallets on my next Target venture 😌 I hope your life in Texas is even more beautiful than imagined 🐎🪴🌷
Ehhh I’m so excited to watch and come along for the ride☀️🤩
I usually don't like to watch vlogs, I love that format but can't stand how loud and ... hysterical vloggers usually are. I think I'll enjoy you cause you are calm and funny at the same time 🙏✨️
Congrats!!! Everything will work out! You guys will be happier than ever in your new place! ❤️❤️
Okay, I love the house you've been living in!! It's so beautiful and cute 🥰😍
I just knew it was gonna be Texas! It seems like everyone is going there. LOL  (I'm from there, as a transplant) Good choice! 😍
I just moved to Texas too! Congrats Tati ❤
❤️
wishing you all the love ❤️
I love you so much and this video gives me so much joy and inspiring me to move too😊. Not that I don't love my current place in Wellington NZ, but we also wanna move to sunnier Auckland. Enjoy the whole process and keep us updated! 😘😘😘
I'm excited to watch you on this new adventure! :) Love the format of the video.
You are going to LOVE living in the South!!  So excited for you!  But get ready for the heat and humidity!! And get your Pup a special collar or vest for coyotes and birds of prey!  You can’t let little dogs out alone even if you have a fenced in yard!
Just buy new makeup until you’re able to unpack bc you’ll try to take all your favorites.
Welcome to Texas Tati! 🥳🥳🥳
Yes continue this new format!
Congratulations to the move everyone seam to be moving here to Texas also so many moves here to move away Texas again since Texas is not New York or California things work a bit different here 😂😂😂 but welcome to Texas  ♥️
You can do it! That's crazy. 7 studios in 11 years. That's mind-blowing. All that packing would have made me bonkers! LOL.  I'm so proud of you!  You're getting everything you wished for. I'm so excited to see the new place. I couldn't be happier for you and James!  And the look you did today was absolutely stunning!❤❤

What an adventure! I moved from CA to CO a few years ago, didn't know a soul and had never visited the area we moved. Best decision of my life, I've never been happier. Congrats to you both!
Omg we're moving there too! Congratulations! 🤗❤
This Texan is SO excited for you!!!!! You are such an amazing woman. Welcome to Texas, from San Antonio 💗
I LOVE THESE KIND OF VIDEOS💗💗💗
You will soon hate the weather. I promise you🙈 You can trust me or  just ask any Texan! It’s the most indecisive, annoying characteristic of the state. I still love it tho because Texas is truly one of a kind!❤️
Omg more vlogs pleeeeeaaaasssseeee. Love ya Tati!
I want to get ready and put some makeup just by watching your vlog !
Am so on broad can't wait

I just moved last month- packing in storage totes FTW! It makes a huge difference. Best of luck!
Yea part II
I'm so happy for you Tati! Thanks for taking us with you on the journey!
So down for other content from you!!! Vlogs, home organization, makeup, anything!

Yessss congrats to Texas, Tati! We are lucky to have you!
OMG Welcome to Texas!!!!!! So excited for your new journey! Many many blessings!!! ✨♥️
Congrats on the move can't beat fresh starts 🙂🍻
We love Texas, and are still residents of TX until my husband retires from the military... Maybe see ya there in a few years? 🙂
Welcome to Texas ❤️ We are happy to have you 😘
Tati, when you get settled in would you consider doing a “makeup I brought with me while moving” video? You mentioned being indecisive about what to bring since all your makeup would be packed up and I think we would love to see what must-haves you couldnt live without for those few weeks 🥰🤗 congrats on your move!
Love it
You look amazing without makeup! Enjoy your new home-love your vlog!
I'm so happy for you guys 💕 new home will be blessed! Love u, Tati!
Congratulations on your move Tati!! We are here for new adventures, beginnings and blessings in your new 🏡 home💖💖🤗Bless you!!!
OMG I’m moving to Texas in December (currently in Germany-mil fam) I’m sooooo stoked to be in the same state as you!! We are moving to San Antonio!!
Welcome to Texas from Hot steamy San Antonio!!!
♥️
Great place to move Tati !!! If I were to ever move it would be Texas as well. 😊😊😊😊😊😊
Love this vlog style! 😍 Congratulations!!
I LOVE this!! More videos like this please!!!! Congratulations on your move ❤️
I knew it was TX
Nice
Seattle has turned into such a hell hole. Stupid policies in place, sadly. You’ll love it here in Texas! Freedom, opportunity, and the American way 😄
My family moved away from everything we knew and all of our relatives, my senior year of high school. California to Tennessee, and it was actually the BEST decision ever!!! And our relatives ended up moving to TN years later because they loved it so much when they visited us!😂 Congrats on your move, I’m so excited for you!🥰❤️
Welcome to Texas ❤️
Where is she moving to ?
Welcome to Texas! From Austin 🥰
Hi Tati 👋 BTW! Life is a special event wear whatever you want whenever you want! Lol
Yayyyyy so exciting for you! Much love
Welcome to Texas!!! I love, love, love our state!
please use a vlog camera! the iphone shots making me dizzy
I love vlogs and I Tati vlog? It’s just a dream ❤️
OMG, A VLOG! I'M SO EXCITED TO WATCH IT!
Welcome to Texas! You’re going to love it!
How exciting!  It will be so neat to see your new place!
Of course you're moving to Texas. Well, you'll love it here - just enjoy it for what it is and don't try to change it. The weather's great (unless you're near the upper coast), any type of land formation or ecosystem you could ever want to visit is found here, and our speed limits out west are 85mph. Hope you settle in nicely! I'm sure you won't miss the gloomy, wet PNW.
I'm so excited for you that I couldn't wait to watch the whole video before commenting! Sending nothing but positive prayers your way ❤️
#Puka #PukaShell #PukaWestbrook
Tv too high
Love you tati!❤ your amazing!!
I thought for sure it was going to be Hawai'i! 😂
Packing to move, bare faced - and beautiful! All the best to you both!
Am I the only one that hopes and prays she finds her wedding ring Tati lost in the move?
I'm so excited for your family.
Best wishes and safe travels / moving!
Congratulations Tati!  It’s good to move to a new place and start fresh.  Knowing your taste I’m sure your house is beautiful.

I suspected that’s where you’d be planting your roots, lol. So many influencers live in Austin now.
