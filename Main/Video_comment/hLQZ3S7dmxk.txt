He knows to much about coke to not have encountered it
I swear it must have been like 2003 when I saw this I always was scared when Barbie went down the stairs because I thought the evil woman was sleeping down there and she would wake her up or something LOL
OH MY GOODNESS! I remember that barbie Rapunzel and I found it horrifying when barbie has a nightmare about the mother grabbing barbie in her hand and barbie is like "Let me go" and it just completely traumatised me
Kelly barely has any visible whites of her eyes so they just look like black demon eyes
Kay so just after the gnome fire rant I got an add about home insurance where the dude was talking about it being his 100th fire 😂😂😂
Surprisingly the Barbie Repunzel movie actually had an answer for how someone can climb her hair without hurting her. She wraps it around the pillar next to her so all of the weight is being placed on the hair around the pillar and not on her. Other versions have done similar things.
I accidentally changed videos and i was extremely confused when during a tony hawk movie review you started talking about barbie.
DYLANS NOT WHITW
Incredibly different films, immediately could tell this was made my a man
artic monkeyyyssss
18:44 I laughed way too much at this
What About Brush Where Was It To Dissapear Upitnik
What About Brush Where Was It To Dissapear xd
That moment when you realize that he basically replaced the extra greetings with "BALLS".
8:09 ªbōô
She may not have genitalia but Barbie sure gets pregnant.
Also I farted so hard I scared myself
Angry twerking didn't take off ,I'm still waiting ....
kurtis there are brat kids movie- sleep over adventures and the fairytale one -trust me
When I was younger I really loved the Barbie movies, and I watched one bratz movie and it scared me to death. I don’t even remember what movie it was but for some reason 6 year old got traumatized from bratz
the voice acter for the weasel sounds like Hisoka from hunter hunter??!!!!!
OH MY GOD SMALL SOLDIERS MENTIONED!!!   I love that movie :)
Kurtis….itonyamovie…chill out
6:34 history was made 👏
Watching this just makes me want to see Kurtis watch the monster high movies!!!
3:41 hahaha lol ROFL
full do i wanna know gnome cover when
Random and late but repunzel Barbie’s hair is so thin 😂 she needs to do hair treatment and stop straightening it frfr
Balls
Matel me that😂😂😂 I lost it!!!
6:35
Little does Kurtis know but the sound of those footsteps literally altered my brain chemistry - that noise scratches an itch in my head like nothing else. Music would have robbed it
Cant forget the Wiesel moaning
4:12 assing me
I am from México and my first thought was the vrg stood for a mexican slang, I don´t know if I can write it here, but add an e between v and r, and an a at the end, that word
2:54 vocal steam frrr
The origin of the BaLlS.
Holy heck this is where the "Ball" came from?
There’s no way that bratz is better than barbie
6:36
9:30 as far as I remember in the original story she cuts her hair off and weaves a ladder! Then the witch lady/mother (?) confiscates the ladder then cuts ALL her hair off
I remember watching Barbie as rapunzel with a friend when we were little and I DO NOT REMEMBER THE HORNY WEASEL WHAT THE FUCK
Simbaline and Briana
Watching this made me realize that my frequent recurring nightmare of being chased by a garden gnome is from this movie. Thanks Kurtis
Came here for the "balls" reference.
I AM BEGGING YOU TO WATCH THE MYSCENE MOVIES
6:56 they has to send dickpictions
Commenting from the future, bc I went looking for the sound effect origin. I think the weasel shoulder joke is the most filthy joke you ever made on this channel. I don't think it has been supplanted ever since.
its 2025 and i can quote this video word for word
The fact he didn't GIVE US A GREETING, cancel him now 2025
I think the live action version of Gulliver's Travels had a scene where the big guy pissed out fires like a fire hydrant. For all I know that might match the original source material more than the animated film where I'm pretty sure he just used water iirc.
9:56 normally she holds it and pulls them up like a rope! Attached to her head
7:57 lol
ya hooo da ba yo
What do you mean 4 years ago???
22:34 “and this is just not realistic bc-“ Ah yes, bc the rest of this movie is _definitely_ realistic 👍
I watched nearly all of the Barbie movies when I was younger. I lovedddd them but never had I heard of Bratz until I started watching Youtube
do u wanna gnomeeee if ts feeling grows both waysss its sad to see u goooo was sorta hoping that youd stay
"this was your one chance for Kelly to not look like what stubbing your toe feels like" I wish you knew how much I wheezed and laughed and cried at that 🤣🙌🏻
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
11:16 katseye reference
21:55 genuinely horrifying
Kurtis I am your biggest fan, greetings from Portugal
The Barbie life in the dream house show was genuinely one of the best pieces of media of all time
ya hooo da ba yo
Hedwig is a girl💔🥀
I got a barbie exercise VHS at like 5 or 6 back in the early 90s that featured a very young Jennifer love Hewitt (credited as Love Hewitt). I remember trying to watch it and do the exercises bc my mom was always watching Jane Fonda exercise videos. The 80s were ...odd.
25:10 Thalia??? You there???
16:11 Stop with the weasel Kurtis. Just stop. Please.
18:43 He quoted Arctic Monkeys. I'm severely attached now.
1:18 some action figures are used for posing and collecting
12:16 — I wanted to eat those foot steps when I was younger😩
god the angry twerking scene killed me
I wish that clip of him dancing was a little longer 💀
6:33 balls
this video gave me like 8 vocal stims at least. the pixie party scene sent me into oblivion dude i keep remembering it and laughing, girl was dancing so furiously and kurtis reacting just killed me, "jesus christ what the fuck lol"
6:35 and here we see the birth of an audio Kurtis refuses to stop using.
i almost choked on my food while watching this cs i laughed too hard
Coming back to this idk why I never realized he should watch a monster high movie next
Curtis starting the bratz segment with the best bratz movie 😮‍💨🔥
Dear Mr. Mayor, at 24:50 those are NOT!!! unicorns, they are clearly ALICORNS!!!!!!!!! i am DISGUSTED!!!!!!!!!!! you would get this wrong, UNSUBSCRIBED AND ALSO IM MOVING OUT OF KURTISTOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!! thx
Im always be a bratz However i never hated barbie because she is the reason why beautiful and fashionistas exist in this world❤
this video has haunted me for years. every night i think about the Kelly hate, where is Kelly? where did she go...
Don't be mad at the weasel. Gothel is a COUGAAAAAR RAWR
11:44 executive dysfunction be like:
6:35 i laughed so hard i shit my pants  7:48 help now i peed myself  7:53 oh my gosh i need therapy
6:54 chivalry is dead bring back the ball scrolls
The snow joke made me chuckle
please I beg you to do a video about the DCOM Avalon High bc truly wtf was that !!!!!! The people need to know
Virgin…
Hedwig is a FEMALE.
ya hooo da ba yo
Shoulda watched Barbie in a fashion fairytale
6:42 if only we knew then, what we know now, about this sound clip
MY EXTRA GREETING! YOU MONSTER!!!
3:36 unfortunately if you have good enough lawyers you can find some legal reason to do so. But obviously morally you shouldn’t
GiVe hIm tO mE, aUuoogh
Fun fact. I had a dream last night where my mom was getting a call from Kurtis Then probably his wife was just in my house talking to my mom It was so weird bro
5:56 phone ding
The weasel's voice actor is also responsible for the voice of Rolf from Ed, Edd, and Eddy, as well as Goku during the Namek Saga - Peter Kelamis, what a mensch.
8:49 owls get who-ney 😏
wait do you think Bratz is the reason barbie started making dolls with different skin colors or did they dart doing they before Bratz and stuff?
10:59 "Give him to me, 𝓪𝓾𝓰𝓱~" - Otto, the Horny Weasel.
Bro, you have GOT to do one of these about Monster High!
What do i knose is better
Lmao bro great video🔥
lol
hey good job man i really liked this one! - squidthecynic
I forgot about Chalk Zone and now I'm having a flood of memories holy shit
Hedwig is a FEMALE owl. I know because my grandmother's name was Hedwig.
18:07 nobody : “sHe iS A pIxIe!” “I don’t know what that means in the context of this film” “She’s a P I X I E”
He did not pick the best Barbie movie… it’s good but there are way better ones
i feel like you had something against the barbie movies from the start. should’ve watched barbie princess and the pauper
Dude I used to watch Barbie Rapunzel I forgot about it!!!
wait, is this “that one time”???
Okay but the bratz music goes unbelievably hard 🙏
6:57  BRO MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY “testiscrolls”
6:23  💀
my bratz phase was so fucking strong. I was obsessed. I even had the blue convertible that played music. I miss that time so much. 😭
I don't know if anyone touched on this, but even though barbie was made with an unrealistic body, she was the *first* doll for girls that was not a baby. Where dolls for boys (actionfigures, also with unrealistic bodies mind you) were already aimed at being hero-type-role-models that boys could look up to, dolls for girls were soleley aimed at practising motherhood. Barbie was the first doll that showed girls a role model of a woman with a life and career of her own. I feel like the part where barbie actually did empower young girls is often very forgotten.
Don’t compare Bratz to Barbies because in reality bratz  have the bigger head but they have a better movie than Barbie maybe Barbie has good music and some movies but preferred the other because the other one has a spunky personality while Barbie when it has a Pepe girl
A pixie means of flying fairy
that’s not how Rapunzel goes if you watch the real Rapunzel it’s nothing like the Barbie’s version Rapunzel Barbie doll Rapunzel is just a rip off. I prefer Bratz dolls. Because I have more spunk in personality and sass like every teenager. Barbie is more of a peppy girl. She’s a VSCO girl.
The Barbie’s basically say something different about bright Barbie say you could be anything you dream of like there is a bunch of Barbie movies that I used to watch and yes, my sister of course she was a brat fan so yeah I like Barbies, my sister like brats but now I like both
But Barbie is basically have wheelchair for wheelchair people like disable abilities, or whatever made to move Barbies and all the other stuff
But Barbie literally has a kid that you could shave, which is horrendous and then Barbie’s best friend was pregnant in one of those back in the day so you think that’s weird. That’s very weird.
Even Monster High and ever after high had controversy too
I remember the controversy, Barbie against Bratz and basically one of them get sued for literally one of them got sued for the others you know
Wiesel 😭
"Give him to me, aauuhhhh💦"  The most iconic line from barbie rapunzel
I swearr this barbie film looked better when i was a cking loke bruh
Matpat actually made a theory about the whole hair thing
Bratz fashion pixies was literally one of my top Bratz movies
As a mexican I just assume “Vrg” means verga
9:18 this part truly shows how much kurtiz is a country boy at heart, the first thing he thought of was milking a cow
I mean Joe Rogan has one sooooo……… 0:22
Barbie saying "Balls" with reverb has no RIGHT to be this hilarious😂
Bratz🤢 Barbie 💯
About the hair pulling thing in Rapunzel ... there are people in real life that can pull helicopters by their nipples or lift weights with their private parts. So I think it'd be possible to carry a human after you wrap your hair around something to reduce the tension 😂
I’m sorry but as a former film student I started laughing when I heard will helm 😂
ngl I've seen every barbie and bratz movie... and the two you picked honestly both sucked lol
17:26 I came here to watch this specific scene for the 20th time maybe? All I can say is that, that's what my day needed for me to have a peaceful and happy sleep
I love both
Ultra Realistic Barbie is real now, thanks mayor
This video is my first impression
I heard a Arctic monkeys reference
I occasionally come back to rewatch this video solely for the weasel
The best part about the comments is people bringing logic into his jokes. 😅
13:10- 13:16 Wouldn’t have worked Kurtis, she would have fallen to her death. It would’ve made for a better ending.
Bruh the arthur knock-off song 😭😭
I loved watching this
It’s been years since I’ve watched this video and I still get “Rapunzel is bald now” stuck in my head every now and then…
Bro, you need to choose a better Barbie movie, tbh This is not what i hrew up with
Team Kelly
10:14 It is crazy how much bald Kurtis looks like my father. I am scared!
Balls.
1:53 was that a… helluva boss reference…
Bratz Pixies is the only Bratz movie I watched as a kid, but the way I still quote it to this day is concerning.
I think he would love the princess and the nutcracker, that movie had me rolling as a kid, please if you do another one use this movie, it’s amazing
8:35 chief weasel from wind in the willows was hornier
🎶Rapunzel is bald now🎶 is still the funniest shit ever
The official end of the extra greeting
ai'm gonna pess on yaou!
You should watch the video on how bratz pixies is an allegory for teen substance abuse... I can't unsee it
MATTEL ME THAT HUH? got me way  harder than it should’ve
I beg of you to watch monster high and eah
6:37 *Kurtis, in fact, did not move on. He continues to use the Reverbed Barbie Balls sound effect to this very day.*
25:04 made me spit out my drink.
4:56- 5:00 Kelly: “Yeah, it’s big brain time.”
Hey!! Did y'all know that Stephen Salvatore is based off of this Stephen?😂🤗😂
If she's a "pixie"....... Is she a stick?
as a kid rapunzel was my absolute favorite story, like i had a book of the original story. i asked for a rapunzel barbie for crhistmas but tangled only came out the year after and barbie as rapunzel had already fallen off and the only reason i was able to get one because our country was so behind on american trends
6:35 the day the world changed
I’d like to report this is an excellent video to play in the background while you paint eldritch horrors 10/10
N
i laughed far to hard for the barbie segment
"Every movie needs a horny weasel." - Kurtis Conner
you should have made a Spyro the dragon joke in the barbie review, looks just like him but bigger!
21:35
Watch the barbie nutcracker, pls xD
I came back to this bc of the Taylor swift hallmark movie vid😂
so the thing is,rapunzels hair probably doesnt hurt at all cuz if you hold the top of your long hair while the hair is pulling down you wouldn’t feel anything on your scalp
I love the balls origin story
I should not be laughing this hard at barbie saying *B A L L S* and a bratz doll aggressively twerking
Mayor, you have no idea the devastation of re-introducing my brain to *balls* from this damn Barbie movie. (i love it).  I had locked out ONLY the Rapunzel one because of that HORNED UP, FREAKY AHH VOICED, SLUTTED OUT WEASEL.
Kurtis REALLY should compared this bratz movie to Barbie A Fairy Secret instead ngl..
I need Barbie vs monster high
I feel like they did change the story for Barbie as Rapunzel a lot because Tangled hadn't come out yet by many years so they adapted it from Grimm Brothers (kidnapped at 12, her moved to a deserted place, a blinded prince, and the birth of her children etc) or whatever old tale they looked at which were pretty different to the Barbie version  --   love the video and the use of the BaLLs sound even years later lol
Balls echo echo echo echo
Monster high has the best dolls and movies no doubt
6:35 and lo, a legend was born
28:46 bless you
this is truly the video to watch as I eat a balsamic vinegar smelling and slightly tasting blueberry cupcake
Do I wanna gnome
The only reason I subscribed was for the extra greeting >:(
i peed my pants at 22:00
1:53 helluva boss reference?
Um.. actually I gave my Barbie’s and cooked them!
1:50-2:10 So the Bratz dolls were seen as sexualized sluts in comparison to the modest & dignified Barbie dolls???
19:00 James Charles?🤨
as an irish person that little leprechaun is genuinely one of the best representations of an accurate irish accent lmaoooo
5:56  I dunno the word for it.... Horny? 😰
My sister loved dolls she had hella bratz and Barbie’s. Movies as well, the bratz were always more fun to play and watch imo
Just to answer the question, no, having your hair pulled doesn't hurt if it's disconnected to the root, such as this case ☝️🤓
i grew up with barbie rapunzel and i remember my sister being horrified of kelly bro shes worse than the iceage baby💀💀
been saying this since i was 8, dillon is the best and funniest character ever created
6:54 I hadn’t finished this video bc my phone died. When I charge my phone and start from where I left off, this is what I hear 😂
Bratz Starrin’ & Stylin is the OG you gotta try and do that compared to Barbie and the nutcracker both were amazing as a kid, 😂😂
Hi
I watched both when I was a kid but boy oh boy I think brats super babyz or the dimondz brats movie has to be the top
Hi Kurtis, bird owner here! The question of do owls get horny, probably. I own birds and my birds are freaky, my cockatiel honestly if something is off and it’s mating season he starts trying to nest and attacking me and everything around. Angry because horny and no female cockatiels. Also, him and my male budgie both hump their toys. My budgie hasn’t in a while because he has a girlfriend but my cockatiel will find a toy or something, fight with it for about 2 to 3 weeks and then eventually will aggressively hump it, sing to it, and then attack the fuck out of it. So yes I believe owls do get horny. My birds do and it’s awful
Ballz
My favorite afab drag queens name is Sigourney Beaver 💖
my sister is pooping <3
Why is the dragon curvy..? 💀😭🙏
12:34
So I just started watching ur videos out of order this summer and I haven’t gotten to this one until today  but I’ve always wondered where the BALLS thing came from. So glad to know it was from Barbie’s lips
No extra greeting? I'm unsubbing.
It's time to rewatch this playlist again because it never fails to make me laugh and kurtis is my comfort youtuber ! 💕😂
Kurt, buddy... they animated his mouth moving for the moan, that shit was added on purpose.
its all movie this, movie that but are we not gonna talk abt the fire bratz soundtrack !! not even js bratz but in barbie fairy secret, the one where she’s like a mermaid princess, and the spy movie like it goes so hard
14:25 “aw…aw….aww….AAAAAAAA”
Kelly looks like young Jojo siwa
Omg it's fucking Kelly, nevermind! lmao
I’m Gonna need you to do Bratz genie magic
16:23 Tarantino being in the horny weasel category was unintentionally hilarious with the fetishes he’s accused of having 😭💀
Bratz >>>>>> Barbie in everything ngl
2:53 community refrence
Please watch Barbie and the diamond castle
Wow !! If you notice in many scenes Rapunzel has a massive forehead too
Why didn't Rapunzel tie her hair to the window bars and absail down. ?
Mmmmmmm but ........ Brats do kinda look a little like nasty little 5lut wannabes 😮
I think your missing something..... Cindy doll dude....... What you thinking ?
8.3m views smh on this.... Wow...who's watching this..
Seems like "Very Really Gay". Not that there's anything wrong with that
Love Barbie 💜🤞
Bruh hedwig was a girl smh my head
VeRGa
The Irish gnome had me in tears the Irish slang was on point😭 “cailiní” “what would ur mam think” I can’t that’s the most accurate Irish dialogue and accent I’ve heard in a movie and it’s from the frickin Bratz movie😭💀
I love ur videos bro and fwwww
you NEED to watch bratz kidz sleepover adventure and baby bratz the movie!!
I am proud to say that my country kept the weasel horny in our dubbing. 😂🎉
17:43 bruh why is this so dam funny
11:06💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
This kurtis guy is quite the goofball
Really interesting commentary, they can be sexual or not on their way by themselves but without being objectified mainly by others.
What does the fact that this is my comfort video say about me? 😅
The tiny Irish gnome is everything to me
I feel like it would’ve made more sense to watch the best rated Barbie and Bratz movie 😂
I think a fairer comparison would have been a barbie movie with fairies and this pixie Bratz movie. Maybe like Barbie Fairytopia kind of thing. That way it might have paralells instead of just a repunzel retelling or something. That's what I'd have done at least lol
ya hooo da ba yo
When I run out of videos to watch of yours, I seriously don’t know what I’m going to do
How did Kurtis not mention the HUGE DRAGON in Barbie??????
She wasn’t twerking while angry 🤣 she was raving. Some people look angry while doing it, it’s part of the vibe
Id sue whoever made homework
This is my favorite Kurtis video, since he uploaded it. Everytime I want a good laugh I watch this episode. Thank you Kurt boi😁
i will never understand why gothel is so into keeping the house get cleaned like that every day like she disappears most of the day and NEVER has guests over
6:36 and life was never the same in kurtistown
26:23 we don't approve Kelly's slander in this household 😤
the gnome is the best irish representation weve ever had EVERYTHING he said was 100% accurate 😭🙏
😂😂😂 this one tickled me so hard
You should do ever after high vs monster high nextt
Oh, wow, the barbie movies were so much prettier in my head. Guess my memories gave them a pretty nice glow up
I have to say: The plot of that Bratz movie is perfect for the target audience in pretty much every way. If I watched it when I was a kid, I would have eaten that shit up. It may as well have been actually made up by young girls playing with Bratz dolls.
It was probably a bad idea to eat outside while watching this 5:57  I can't stop laughing 😂
this video has been making my life measurably better for three years now
10:10 RAPUNZLE IS BALD NOWW
25:15 Fun fact: trees are actually unable to feel sad, meaning the mom still being happy isn’t as unrealistic as you thought
OH MY GOD SO when i was younger (i live w my grandparents) they had these cds and there was a player that we could atch dvds an stuff on and i LOVED THE BARBIE AS REPUNZEL MOVIEIEIIEIE
It actually wouldn’t hurt her hair becuase think of it a a pulley that how she was able to bring him up was cause she threw it into a loop and then pulled plusss her hairs magic
Arthur theme song did kinda slap
I want what the Barbie animal creators are having
2:45 Kurtis are you stupid? Girls don’t fart.
Johnson Sarah Jones Sandra Perez Helen
My mom has said Bratz are inappropriate and sexual bc they have “d*ck sucking lips,” as if she, a white elementary school teacher with majority Pacific Islander students, doesn’t have literal 7 year old girls under her care with puffy/thick lips exactly like that… so I wouldn’t listen to anyone who thinks Bratz are sexualizing girls because they’re probably the actual ones doing it
You know after looking at some of the comments, I'm surprised no one is mentioning the doll line and webepisode series Mattel made. They made the my scene dolls in competition. Its also funny to note that they actually named one of the girls Barbie even though you know, they have a whole line for her. They later changed it. My Scene had a whole website where you could play games, watch webepisodes and I think purchase the dolls? The website is now obviously down so I'm not confident in the purchasing dolls claim. Mattel also made 3 movies, one that even featured Lindsey Lohan! Anyways, the doll line got discontinued due to the how court and lawsuit thing that happened with Mattel and Bratz. I apologize for yapping 😭
I can't. Lol 😂 26:20
play 6:01 and 11:00 at .5 speed
Kurtis needs to be watch the Barbie Diaries, I think it would just destroy him 😂
"euurgh"
H0f
This girl on TikTok (so not very trustworthy) said that since the weight would be distributed throughout her whole head it probably wouldn’t hurt that much for her to hang from it
I think Quentin Tarantino would have actually won that award.
editing the balls joke in cause he forgot it was kinda peak ngl
The Bratz are more scared of Gnomes than Mabel Pines
He should see Ken’s moves in fairytopia
14:32 EEAHHH
12:23 😂
Why dose the backgrounds look like mario 64
...........................BALLS
Not me realizing that this is where the balls sound comes from  I love that sound so much it makes me laugh every time guaranteed
virgin boy
I’m watching this during brat summer 😜
Idk what had me laughing harder, Barbie saying balls with reverb of that arctic monkeys reference also Kurtis basically predicted brat summer
he kinda look like the weasel… no hate tho 🫶
I know this was 3 years ago, but can anyone tell me the background music to the “Rapunzel is bald now”? It sounds familiar and it’s driving me crazy
Answer: Monster High.
Cause Barbie much like Mario is an iconic brand that’s pretty much the face of their respective industry and has existed for decades and we’re really popular in the 1980s and both had successful films last year and Bratz is essentially the Sonic of the doll industry in that both brands were created to compete with the dominant brand on their respective industries Mario for gaming and Barbie for dolls and bratz much like Sonic we’re essentially embodiments of what each target consumer found cool and trendy in the decades they were created and both essentially were popular enough in their respective decades to rival the brand they were were created to best in sales but once the decades went by it seemed both Sonic and Bratz seemed to not have the same mainstream relevance they once had though Sonic at the moment seems to be going through a sort of renaissance at the moment with him having two successful theatrical films and recent games starting to be good
I feel like this was the girl toy equivalent to Mario vs Sonic
as long as you tie the hair into a knot around a pillar then drape the rest over, the tension would only be on the strands and not the scalp so therefor it wouldnt hurt
21:05 It's gracious of you to assume that it would be piss, instead of something......else.
im 7 and im team bratzs weird
OMG. I am laughing so hard rn when he's talking about the little girl looking like a stubbed toe. Idk what he said because I am laughing so much in my apartment building hallway at 8:30 am and I am sure I sound crazy. OMG. 😂
I do appreciate that Dylan's sub plot was not brought up again so we can just assume he died of exhaustion like those people who can the dancing plague in like mideval France
this Bratz movie used to be one of my favourite movies when I was a kid lmao 😂
i still am creeped out by Bratz dolls, i do however appreciate that their magical world movie, had a soundtrack, with music.
Bratz dolls still freak me out, however i do like that their magical world movie had music.
finally found out where the "balls" audio came from
5:23 long ass hair or long ASS hair?... (i know this was made 3 years ago but i had to 😔)
HELP I OWN ALL THE BARBIE MOVIES T_T
7:23 “where she stumbles upon some cute kids riding a horse and.. OH MY GOD ITS KELLY”   a bit after : saying that Kelly looks like what stubbing your toe feels like 😂
Every time I see that Matrix scene I lose it. I love rewatching this video. 😂😂
Penelope was afraid to fly most of the movie. There’s a whole scene that shows how her dragon father disappointed in her because of it. That’s why they didn’t escape sooner
I choked on a chip and cryed when Barbie said balls
Does “pixie” have a double meaning?
Its been 3 years and the rapuncel jingle is stil unironically one of the greatest things ive heard
did the gnome just speak gaeilge
Disney's Tangled and Maleficent were both hugely inspired if not based on Barbie as Rapunzel, change my mind.
okay but does anyone else remember that one bratz movie with the evil dog that talked, feels like such a fever dream but I remember being genuinely so scared watching It
i think i stumbled onto the video that made the Barbie saying balls a running joke for future vids. wow. 6:46
Anyone else else think bald Kurt looks more than a little like iDubs?
✨Rapunzel is bald now✨
Knowing my 6-12yr old cousins, LOL dolls are hitting the market HARD.
barbie as rapunzel was my fav movie when i was young for some period of time
Barbie fairytopia tho
Ok I know I’m late to this but this is giving oblivion vibes
18:59 sounds like something a virgin would say
"Scrotum scrolls" is actually an insane thing to say but hilarious 😂
21:41
The bratz movie was so magical as a kid like the glasses scene, the club, their mom!!?? I love it so much
This just occurred to me 3 years later but this barbie movie would be better alongside the bratz fairytale movie instead
i remember that THAt bratz movie was my gay awakening, cymbeline was so gorgeous in my eyes
Having only recently (mid-2024) started watching Kurtis videos, this was NOT the video I expected “🗣️BALLS🗣️” to originate from
im 27 and i am still crying from watching bits of Repunzel
The SCREAM I scrumpt when I realized you were doing the Barbie rapunzel movie.. I was hoping but didn't think it would happen! I had that movie on a dvd, and a mini portable dvd player, and I would watch that movie over and over and over again. I don't even know why, but thank you for making my week with this. I had blocked out the weasel. Did the balls clip come from this??
This is definitely not biblically accurate
Kurtis "Do owls get horny?" Helluva Boss Fans: "VERY."
do i wanna gnome
We need the horny weasel as a shirt😂
the “ultra realistic barbie” joke was way ahead of its time hahaha
Team BRATZ idc
You’re absolutely hilarious and I like that you reviewed these 2 movies I grew up with. Very nostalgic and fun watch. Thanks for
kurits and his team have a lot of information about this phenomenon that is not only important to me but also important for the development of our community as we continue our journey through this process
hi kurtis
I was a little blonde girl with a huge forehead too 🥺
One time i was searching this and searched "kurtis conner balls"
Ok virg
6:00 sus🤣🤣
This video had me laughing hysterically 😂
Oh the nostalgia!
I was about to comment saying I swear you used to be Australian, but then i realised I've been mixing you up with Mike's mic this whole time :')
bratz is better
*B A L L S*
God, I LOVED Barbie Rapunzel as a kid. Just ADORED it.
9:33 Uh yeah, I think that’s why she wrapped it round the pillar lol
6:20
23:45
23:36
8:50 stolas from helluva boss
And now girls do have huge eyes and mega big lips!!!! Way of the world.
11:00 HORNY WEASEL.
Hedwig is female
1:53 BARBIE WIRE?? Like the helluva boss character? Coincidence, I THINK NOT
McDonald’s made my order wrong while watching this. :(
Absolutely bringing back my chilhood memories
you actually made me laugh
6:34 is the part your looking for (balls….)
24:54
21:41
Transfer student? More like Transylvania student!
IF THIS FEELING GOES BOTH WAYS🗣️🗣️
This was the first Kurtis video I ever watched
I NEED MY EXTRA GREETING IM NOT BREATHING UNTIL I GET IT :3
you picked a bad Barbie movie..... there are a lot better out there
ya hoo da ba yo
because Barbie Rapunzel is one of the only cassette tapes I had of a Barbie movie, id have to say ive watched it too much so you are being slightly misleading. Penelope (the dragon) is afraid of heights nor does she even know that was an opening to the barrier before her dad told her. She literally faced her fears just to help Rapunzel so it’s not like oh she could’ve just flew up there. There was a reason she never did- She didn’t know about it plus, she was afraid of heights.😭 and she didnt “ paint the picture of the tower” The painting was already there she had used it earlier to get back to the tower, which is why she knew it was there, and that it would send Gothal into the tower. and another thing, Barbie couldn’t leave the tower, because she had to make sure she was there, so that Goethal didn’t kill Penelope‘s father. That’s another reason why she didn’t try to escape.
Me watching this again cause I had 🎶Rapunzel is bald now🎶  stuck in my head all day
I just want to remind you that the voice actor of the Horny Weasel is the Australian voice actor of Goku.
Barbie is best end of story🤌🏼💕
I don't want to gnome 😂😂😂
yes, dylan is our horny weasel and we love him for that
Best Kurtis video I will have to replaywheneve I wan a good laugh. Adding yo my fave videos of all tim playlist
ya hooo da ba yo
Kelly dolls had the same weird-ass bubble head. I never played with her except when forcing her to work at McD's in her child labour playset
It's funny cause as a mexican when i saw "VRG" behind you i thought of the word "Verga" which is dick in spanish. 😅
Sephán...wrapping his hands around barbie's entire waist. That's the most important scene. PeriodT
I thought the VRG was for Virgo ☹️😭😭😭(I don’t think his a Virgo too)😔😔😔😣😣
Chipper I hardly know her
Ohhh so this is where he got the ”BALLS” sound effect.
In defense of Rapunzel, when your hair is being pulled if you hold it at another point, it doesn’t hurt as much.
Unpopular Opinion - I was a hardcore MyScene Doll girl :')
"I think one of each is enough" HA
21:58 i cant-😫😫😫😫😫😩😩😩😩
i love bratz sm they r so iconic
WHENEVER THAT HORNY WEASEL SHOWS UP I JS DIE HELP
RAPUNZEL IS BALD NOW
I glad Bratz wins, I've always been a Bratz girly
Growing up with the barbie rapunzel and pink shoes (another kelly feature) was like growing up watching salt burn but for weasels
Honestly, I feel that "pulling our your action figures to watch movies with you" thing. Even today, I just like to pull out my transformers and pose or Transform them while watching something to give my hands something to do lol
6:24  reminds me of something vox said... (Hazbin hotel)
People getting along in the Barbie movie* Kurtis: aw,  *more people getting along* Kurtis: aww the kids from the Barbie movie*  Kurtis: AHHhHhHhHhhhHhHhHhHh
I LOVE SMALL SOLDIERS
Both are great but monster high will always stand superior.
9:40 in the clip it looks like her hair is wrapped around the pillar which (if wrapped enough around it) would generate enough friction to stop her from getting yoinked by the guy climbing up
Stop because that repunzel movie was literally my childhood 😭😭😭
This video made my cry from laughing soo much!!! 🤣
Nice choice
That wee Irish gnome stole the show ong
OH MY GOD ARCTIC MONKEYS REFERENCE OH MY GOD
She had a whole dragon, she could have left at anytime 😂
“Dylan twerks about it, which is honestly a power move” now lives in my head rent free… I, too, want to be able to casually twerk about sudden, tragic revelations
17:39
this bratz movie reminds me more of barbie fairy secret
the best barbie movie ever created was barbie the fairy secret 🧚‍♀️🎀🧚‍♀️
Can't believe you missed the opportunity to make a pixie dust joke in the rave scene!
Bratz all the way.
4:52
21:59 22:06
21:47 IM DYING 😭
Cheese
Kurtis is an earthly illusion I swear
please "barbie looks fuckin weird too. she has no asshole, y'ever think about that? how does she fart? mattel me that, huh??" fucking destroyed me
The barbie movie was my childhood omg !!!!!!!!!
The fresh n fit podcast exists so it’s definitely possible for virgins to have a podcast
I am unsubscribing, I will resubscribe once you give me an extra greeting
you may not be a virgin, but there is a 60% chance you are a bottom
monster high >>>>>>
No matter how many times I watch this video it’s never not halarious😂😂😂
Kurtis as bald Rapunzel just looks like idubbbz
i would 360 no-scope kelly
anybody ever play the barbie rapunzel cd game? i still have it haha, my sister and i were OBSESSED with it and still to this day several quotes from it live rent free out heads, including the way barbie named every flower in the outside garden and "the prince turned to stone??! THE PRINCE TURNED TO STONE??!!?!!" is soemthing my sister and i yell in public to find each other LMAOO. we also still have the kelly club game. ❤
1.3 billion in 2020, I can only imagine what it was in 2023 🤯
i had never seen rapunzel in the original dub and that fucking weasel. im going insane the ptbr one is not horny wtf
Here’s the weasel scene ever one is talking about: 10:58
Ya hooo da ba yo
I just realized Kurtis used the Greendale College flag for the butthole joke
rupunzel was my favorite as a kid 😭
you shouls do myscene vs bratz!! myscene was supposed to be a competitor and has 2-3 movies!
Hedwig is a girl
I grew up with both but my parents didn't like bratz because they were brats. 😅 soo. I don't really like either now.
6:58 I can't believe you missed the opportunity to say "Scrolltums" I'm unsubscribing
Fun fact, extra greetings went extinct in this exact video
9:30 there is actualy a mini series you should watch that adresses just that in a realy funny way called The Tenth Kingdom where the mc's hair gets cursed and they have do the rapunzel bit. She isnt happy.
down bad rn for horny weasel ngl
"Could a virgin have a podcast?" Bro has never seen an alpha male💀💀
Ok please you need to watch bratz: super babyz (the most unhinged movie I can remember and Barbie’s mermadia which is just iconic
24;38 pjo reference???
how dare you
Still one of my favorite videos from Kurtis
Scroltums😂😂
10:15 kurtis never looked more similar to harry styles
18:44 i love the artic monkeys reference
When Barbie Rapunzel came out, I absolutely LOVED it. I also loved her purple dragon. I can’t remember the animations looking so bad though 😂
6:33
2:35 😭
Its so weird watching a grown man LMAOOO describe and give his opinoon on ur childhood movies BAHAHA NOT INA BAD WAY its rlly funny seeing his like opinion on things that are lowkey weird asf LMAO AND JUST STRANGE BC like as a kid i never saw em yk i will sau tho as a kid that pixie bratz movie creeped me out a lil but now ITS KIEK YASSSS BITCH RAVE INNA TREE AND HYPNOTIZE EVERYONE i love the bratz
For the Brazilian "voice translation" (really don't know how to translate "Dublagem) they did the barbie ferret gay, and it's the most iconic, amazing, out of this world, shimmering, exceptional, gay character that have ever been forced into a kids film (???)
the flying unicorns are pegasus
why do you hate Mondays ? you are a youtuber you don't have a normal work week
Barbie as Repunzel always reminded of a mixture of Cinderella and Repunzel
I'm obsess about "BARBIE" and I'm crazy about "BRATZ" !❤ Them both are my girls but here is no place for comparison !😢
I noticed that Greendale flag 2:53
i love how balls with reverb is the most replayed part of this video
hedwig is a girl 😡
As someone who's name is Breanna, pronounced the same way, hearing the line "So Brianna's friends get kidnapped by the pixies and Dylan twerks about it, which is honestly a power move" literally made my day you have no idea how hard i laughed
Since it seems like no one else has answered this question, in a couple of different iterations of Rapunzel, especially Tangled, Rapunzel wraps her hair around something and then throws her hair down, so it isn’t pulling directly on her scalp. In Tangled, they put big emphasis on her wrapping her hair around the hook above the tower window
Im back here to watch the trilogy
The irish knome😭
6:37 so this is where he got it from 😂😂😂😂
Seeing the barbie movies is like going back in time. God
You missed out on saying, I got a boner to pick 😞
13:28 kurtis doesnt understand the extenst that abuse snd threats towards a captive person can affect them 🤡🤡
00:02 Us spanish speakers 😭lmaoo vrg
Doth thou carpets match thy drapes!?? Hahaha love you Kurtis,  your humor is Grade  A 👌   🖤🖤🖤
"Performed by London Symphony Orchestra" You can't be serious  How did it end up in this
Why am I just now finding this. I grew up watching BOTH classic Barbie movies and Bratz movies. I’m obsessed and devoted to both of the (CLASSIC) movie franchises still TODAY. And my baby girl will also be watching them until she decides she doesn’t like them (hopefully she doesnt come to that conclusion🥸).
that's not an asshole that's the flag for greendale community college
Bruh that’s not just any Orchestra, that’s the London Symphony Orchestra. The same guys who performed for freakin Star Wars
Can we just talk about how fashionable these bratz dolls are?
"Do thou carpets match thou drapes" 😭😭😭
Bro summoned a whole fandom of invisible hell of a boss fans by saying Barbie Wire
1:52 LMFAO the way i immediately stared thinking of helluva boss
10:15 rapunzel is bald now
18:19 It’s the way I straight up had a dream exactly like this scene. It started with me trying to break into a house and then one of the gnomes turned into a real gnome and chased me💀
1:52 "Call it Barbie Wire" Helluva Boss fans: *furiously pointing and screaming*
pulling of her hair wont hurt her because it is tied around the pillar so all the tension will go the pillar rather than her hair roots...
I thought it was for Virgo
2 years too early, Kurtikus Connorus
The Barbie Rapunzel movie looks like the sims
Kurtis is the only person that can make me genuinely laugh at a fart joke. Truly a revolutionary.
filing a complaint, didn't give me enough time to grab snacks and water.
I WAS KINDA FALLING ASLEEP WITH THIS IN THE BACKGROUND AND THEN I HEARD “that is weasel cum”
REWATCH this is SUCH a good ep
Ok virGIN
I cannot believe this, no extra greeting?  How can i be sure that this wont happen again? How can i trust you? Why even subscribe when one of the promises will not happen?
now that theres a barbie live action and a bratz live action...
Bless you Kurtis
gothel looks like an Alternate from Mandela Catolouge
Thing about the hair climbing;  You see she slung it around the column so no it would not be pulling her neck at all
i convinced my snapchat ai that kurtis invented mondays
i liked for the decimation of kelly, better get digging
rapunzel is ✨BaLd✨ now
3:04
Wait, you WANTED your action figures to come to life after watching Small Soilders?!?
BALLS
Mr Mayor…I beg you pardon but thou has failed to view the cinematic master piece dubbed The Princess and the Pauper
I can't wait to listen to Kurtis's podcast: Virgin's Really Good
Oh god imagine if Kurtis saw Barbie princess and the pauper. With PREMINGER??? Would he have managed?
Do owls ever get horny? 😂😂😂 Is this the content that the dumbed doen masses wants?
Rapunzel has like a whole entire system to let people upper hair. It’s like a knot system where she ties her hair and her head doesn’t support it It’s the knot she tied
Personally Bratz was my favorite cause it was cool seeing a doll that kinda looked like me yknow I was so happy when I got a brats doll cause I had like a mini me a doll with the same skin tone and lips and I never understand the beef between Bratz and Barbie both are dolls and both fitted a specific group of people why are people arguing over which fictional character is better 💀 and I’m so confused why people hated Bratz I never heard a POC said Bratz looked in appropriate soo yh
I can't belive Kelly's face should be the face of the twin girls in the shinning. Imagine Kurtis Conner was Danny in the shining and he saw that.
This has to be kurtis’s most iconic video
It doesn’t hurt for someone to climb up Rapunzel’s hair because she basically uses pulley mechanics to change where the tugging is being applied. Here she had it wrapped around a post (?) and in Disney’s version she hung it on a hook and held it from the other side. That way there isn’t any direct pulling on her scalp. Same way people will hold their hair in a makeshift ponytail to brush out the ends- it tugs where your hand is rather than at the scalp.  Plus if someone climbed up directly applying pressure to the scalp I’d be more worried about her neck before her hair lol
Even 7 year old me thought fashion pixiez was a psa to not take drugs and the affect of drugs on teens
17:24 THIS SCENE
I think it’s safe to say we’re not getting the promised barbie vs brats live action video 🙁
i was not allowed to get anything bratz growing up cause my mom did marketing for barbie (got free dolls tho)
That rabbit from the rapunzel barbie movie terrifies me
ILL DEFEND THE QUIET FIGHT SCENE bc hearing the footsteps and the running placement was epic when I was little it made it intense for me lmao
the angry twerking is just that one scene in new girl (s1,e22) where they're just angrily showing their butts to eachother
7:00 scrolltums? 🤔
10:15 ruh roh (Iykyk)
Damn. He said he was gonna try to not do his regular greeting once and hasn’t given us an extra greeting since 😢
ya hooo da ba yo
That gnome is looking up those girls skirt
I think that tangled handled the idea of rapunzel’s head/neck hurting when someone climbs her hair. In tangled rapunzel wraps her hair around a hook, which makes the hook hold the weight of the person instead of her neck.
you should watch Barbie as The Island Princess if you haven’t already! it was one of my favourite movies and the elephant in it is notoriously annoying lmao she’s a huge meme
This video is so frickin hilarious! Keep it up! :D
what if Bratz were the start of people wanting to get lip filler
The fits go hard 😂
The barbie balls reverb is never gonna leave my head
Do I wanna Knome?
You would be absolutely terrified if people were just flying from the sky with no feasible explanation of why?
That eewww is from this??? I thought that was Sarah schauer!
that was the best arctic monkeys pun ever
bless you
So this is where the famous “balls” came from
do i wanna gnome 🗣️🗣️
Scrotum Scroll was my nickname at church camp. 🙏 🎉😊
I WANT MY EXTRA GREETING
Bro seeing the Bratz movie just like washed memories back into my head
wow I forgot about fashion pixiez, I used to watch this all the time as a kid and that club song was a bop 😂
I've done it. I've finally found the origin of the balls soundbite. It's my lucky day!
This caught me completely off guard 💀 10:06
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MY EXTRA GREETINGGGG D:
"ya hooo da ba yo”
You should do a video about this really bad movie about math called flatland
i love the irish gnome
The birth of the best sound bites
18:41 do i wanna gnome? If this feeling goes both ways? Do I wanna gnome?
9:50 If you do the right knots, you can transfer the force completly into the knot
“Rudy’s got the chalk!”
I watched Bratz Fashion Pixies RELIGIOUSLY as a kid. Like you know how every six year old has that one movie or tv show that they watch EVERY single day without fail? Bratz Fashion pixies was one of mine.
0:29 Me after reading 4 of Neville Goddard's books
yk, purple dragon and rabbit as friends, kinda sounds like sofia the first
Balls ❤
These two movies were my childhood
Funny thing is the only thing I could remember from the Rapunzel Barbie movie is the dragon No joke I named a little purple dragon toy I had after it  Edit: there's also a Barbie Rapunzel game
I was trying to put in whitening strips on while watching this, accidentally shallowed one laughing so hard.
"do I wanna gnome" is actually the best joke I have encountered on this channel
I already hated kids, at the age of 12,  I guess I'm just a master gamer
i have rewatched this video so many times, and I JUST now noticed Kurtis using the James Charles sound and username for his apology 💀🔥
I had both. But the Bratz had spice and had better clothes so clearly in my mind that meant they would perpetually be Barbie’s bully. So everytime i got a new Barbie id be excited bc it’s basically another victim for my bratz
"i wont do the one thing that would solve all my problems until i absolutely have to" is a big fat mood
bro i used to have so many barbie books just cause
Damn "allow me mistress hmmmmmnhggggg" has been living in my head for 22 years
barbie and the farie secret would have been better for this conperson. the reason is it also has a farie secret.
I once saw a metal Barbie baseball bat at goodwill💀💀
9:50 killed me dead
9:29 you can clearly see she wrapped her hair around one of the columns tho lmao
ya hooo da ba yo
Dude! I was super excited with the first image of ur merchbit thinking it was a hooded onesie, but before my natural thought progression could get to the “how could u possibly get it on and off without a zipper or buttons in the front (which I now am envisioning a baby onesie inner thigh/crotchal* (*not a word, I made it up( I feel it translates tho😝)) snap enclosure system)??”, the image of the 2 piece hoodie/jogger set was presented…. Do with that what u will.. (hint: make an oversized, hooded jogger baby onesie😉)
b a l l s
putting that Barbie movie up against the BEST Bratz movie is just asking for Barbie to lose lmao
DO I WANNA GNOME 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️
DIWG🗣️
DIWK
i hate this shit fr
omg he called Rapunsel being bald years in advance. he is a live Simpsons episode
bro why does the Gothel lady look like that guy off of Courage the Cowardly Dog. King Ramses
hedwig is a girl😭
Idk why the Barbie movie just made so much more sense to me as a kid. Like yeah obviously there’s a hole there and yeah obviously he has to run away
Can we just talk about how the designs of the pixies are actually really unsettling? Bratz is known for its huge eyes, but the girl pixies have eyes that are way too big, even for their designs. Their eyes end where a normal Bratz's eyebrows would be, and are nearly wrapping around their head, giving them a crazed look. And it's so noticeable because their eye whites seem to not be shaded at all, making them really pop in their surroundings, almost like they're glowing.  It's such a subtle way to indicate that otherworldliness! (Is that a word?)
I loved this video!
I’m straight but I started watching Kurtis like a week ago and I’m feeling confused
The disney Rapunzel ties her hair around a post thing to make it not hurt when people climb it. That one kinda makes sense, but none of the others do
I can’t not say it- Penelope the dragon’s whole subplot is that she can’t fly because she’s afraid of heights, it’s why she can’t help Rapunzel escape. The dragon we see Gothel flying away on when she casts the spell is Penelope’s dad, so is in service to Gothel, who is super down on Penelope because she’s not brave. It’s only at the end  that she’s able to overcome her fear and earn her Father’s respect in rescuing rapunzel.   I haven’t seen this flick since i was like ten i just loved it that much, I’m so sorry
i wanna mention that if you apply adequate pressure to a part of you hair that isnt the root it makes it a lot less painful when the ends are pulled, just like tension on a rope. so if rupenzel held a portion of her hair it really wouldnt hurt too much for someobe to climb up the rest, especially if it was braided or tied.
It’s so funny watching this now since repunzle might actually be bald now
omg this is so good xddddddd
To be honest, while I know this is a kids’ movie, the girl Kurtis described as “angrily twerking” did not look it to me. It looked more like she was getting (I don’t know how to politely say this) railed from behind.
OK but I'm finding it hilarious how pooping dolls are actually a thing
The last extra greeting :(
22:21 “A dance trance”?   If the character Frye turns evil or goes rogue in Splatoon 4 or a DLC, I feel like that would be one of her newly gained abilities… or maybe it could’ve originally been something she used for good, but it was then turned against her
top 10 videos on the internet right here
we need him to do a monster high video because thats better than both of these combined tbh
"Barbie wire" ur onto something....
Why do the other fairies look like that when they got ambushed 😭
what’s so funny about the lawsuit to me is that it actually DOES make a lot of sense because the guy who made bratz worked for mattel AND worked on a barbie line that *suspiciously* looks quite similar to how the first line of bratz looked (EXCLUSIVELY fashion wise!) RIGHT before he left mattel! so it completely makes sense on mattel’s part this one time 💀😭
I never realized the weasel in Rapunzel was horny... And for the hair pulling thing, I think it could actually tear of the skin that your hair is attached to if you're not careful. 13:15 consider fall damage
How was Rapunzel supposed to weed the garden if she can't leave the tower
8:57 Hedwig is a she.
I actually did think that the vrg did stand for virgin until now
kurtis is so fucking funny in this
Didn’t know brats had a movie I now need to watch all of them
I love the bratz, they are superior buttttt that Barbie Netflix show eats! It’s actually so good
He just predicted bald rapunzel
Kurtis connors fan base are the most unhinged lunatics ever and I’m f*cking here for it 💀😭
The Barbie as Rapunzel movie always meant a lot to me. Even before I realized how manipulative my own mother was, her story resonated with me. And honestly, her not even trying to escape for good until Gothel makes it very clear that she only has her own interests in mind... very relatable
Predicted bald rapunzel
BRATZ 4LIFE ‼️‼️‼️
Team bratz
Bratz is litreally banned in our country because of conservatives😍
MATTEL ME THAT
watching this to fall asleep for the 4th time this week gotta love mental illness
The plot of that bratz movie is kinda like a book I read once called claws
9:58 so I have pretty long hair, and the only thing I can think of, is if rapunzel did something like tangled, and had something holding her hair in place, so if I grip my hair, and brush out a knot below where I’m holding, it doesn’t hurt at all, I can barely feel my hair being pulled, so in that sense, she could be relaxing. But most rapunzel things show that her hair isn’t being held my anything and they’re putting all that weight directly on her head yes.
When the 3rd part of this holy trinity?
Im a 🪬⛏️⛏️⛏️🦯🎳🚴🏿🤽🏿‍♂️🏋🏿🏋🏿🏋🏿🏋🏿🥄🥄🥄
Knowing kurtis isn’t a virgin and thinking about it just doesn’t feel right
"🎶rapunzel is bald now 🎶" , "do i wanna gnome" , "baLls" and "im gonna piss on yew!" have been constant loops in my head for the past 2 years since this video came out
Live action version comparison when?
kurtis publicly stating you have a podcast is really not helping your "not a virgin" case
Hey my cousin  1000% looks like Kelly so sorry but she is real  My cousin is not in my profile picture btw
i’ve watched all of the barbie AND bratz movies and i’ve gotta say i still love the bratz pixies movie it’s so bad that it’s good 😭😭
Okay, on the Barbie movie: 1.) Gothel was voiced by Anjelica Huston. Penelope was Cree Summer, and Hugo (the big dragon) was David Kaye. Literal legends.  2.) Why Penelope didn’t fly Rapunzel out of the tower: It’s established early on that Penelope has trouble doing dragonish things like flying and breathing fire, because of anxiety and pressure from her father, Hugo. She tries to fly in this scene, but can’t get much height. Hugo is loyal to Gothel and will not fly Rapunzel out of the tower. Although, he turns on Gothel later and he’s the one who clues Penelope in about the “lying heart” loophole.
Fun fact Mattel was created to make c4 plastic explosives
If you freeze the frame it looks like she wrapped her hair around the pole for leverage. But what's  really baller is, Mattel deciding to make a movie of one of their most popular brands, but instead of saying let's write an original story or, even possibly and origin story, went with, fk all that. Lets just have her in the movie tell a very well established story, with an already far superior movie adaptation. Up top guys. Meeting is over.
I’ve been trying so so sooo hard to get your Kurtis dragon but I keep getting every dragon but yours!! 😭😭😭
Still disappointed kurtis didn’t watch the fairytopia movies, cinematic masterpieces
6.9 million 🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭
*balls*
His commentary ruined the Barbie movies for me 😭🫶
Great, now do this with the live action Barbie movie
*monster high rn:*
Why does gothal look like a weird sims character 💀
i grew up on barbie but even i can admit the storylines were questionable at times 💀
rapunzel is bald now
No way Kurtis predicted rapunzel being bald…
I feel like Barbie was for the much younger and more impressionable audience/kids. While dolls like Bratz, Monster High and ever after high(maybe even rainbow high) are more just collector esc/fashion based because of the distinct wardrobes of the dolls. Especially the new Rainbow High/Shadow High dolls and Bratz ones. So fucking cool.
they way that kurtis refers to the main four of the group in bratz as “brianna’s friends” is so funny to me
ARCTIC MONKEYS REFERENCE 18:43
leaving a comment so more people can watch this masterpiece
You forgot to give the greeting
The voice actor knew exactly what she was doing pronouncing "Balls" like that
WOWWWW so this is where it all stopped
i will fight to the death for barbie rapunzel anyday, that shit is iconic
10:14 song name?
Hedwig is female. I hate myself.
i think the gnome was saying "Yahoo I'm A Gnome!" and not just gibberish at 24:54          but i mean it doesn't make sense either way.
I think this guy might be a virgin
A little bit after the first “rapunzel is bald now” I started singing it and then the second time happened almost in sync with my singing lol. Perfect timing
the "Mattel me that" got me weak
Barbie had the best movies, Bratz had the best dolls.   But y’all real scared to mention that monster high is better than them both 🙄
Nah bro monster high goats
Bro there's a barbie movie that's basically the same thing as the Bratz one but idk which one came first
7:05 *vhs tape
"Do I wanna gnome? if this garden goes both ways?"
FASHION PIXIES WAS MY FAVORITE MOVIE
between barbie and bratz, the true winner is monster high.
22:09 WHY DOES ANGRY KURTIS LOOK EXACTLY LIKE MY CAT HELPPP
this is the video i use to indoctrinate my friends into kurtistown
hehe, balls
23:40 I’m crying 😭😭😭😭
The weasel takes me all the way out 😭😭😭😭😭😭
barbie rapunzel is the best one 😠 no dissing !
ya hooo da ba yo
barbie movie!
E pluribus anus🫶🏻
I went to the Gem State Comic Con back in April and the voice actor for the weasel was there, with that voice line as the selling point for the character. But get this, he was also an English dub voice actor for Goku 😭😭
Greta Gerwig definitely owes kurtis royalties for the Barbie movie because Barbie DEFINITELY has a functioning asshole by the end of the movie
Testiscrolls
Oh my God I remember the barbie movie, my little sister had the DVD and watched it like twice a week
In the original fairy tale, Rapunzel puts her hair in stone kind of a hook at her windowsill. I read it, and yes without the information it sound ridiculous.
Had both Barbies and Bratz dolls - the edge for me was the clothing and accessories being MUCH more detailed. The tiny cell phones actually had little painted screens and buttons, the car had a glove box and detailed interior with a pearl paint job, much nicer than the comparatively plain barbie car. Details matter!
i cant pinpoint the funniest part of this but my stomache hurts from laughing
18:43 the Arctic Monkeys are shaking
Later Barbie movies are far far better
(Do I wanna gnome?) If the gnomes are small or no? (Sad to see them come) Was sort of hoping that they'd go (Baby, we both gnomes)  - Do I Wanna Gnome? by Kurtis Conner
☆Rapunzel is bald now☆ 10:15
“MATTEL ME THAT” lives in my head rent-free
My sister used to watch the bratz movie. I remember way too much than I should.
fashion pixies was my favorite bratz movie as a kid for whatever reason
18:44 I FUCKING CHOKED ON MY POPCORN
I wanna know why the pixie king chose to look like a schlub in human form?? I mean he could have just as easily been disguised as a different hot old guy than his pixie self? Am I wrong!?
i will never ever get over rapunzel is bald now
🎶rapunzel is bald now🎶 😔😖💔🖤
1:27 underrated song ngl
Well Barbie is out  9:36pm July 28 2023, Friday
No bc that pixie king is a dilf
"Fuck you Kelly" same man same
The Bratz PS2 game was so fun though! Did anyone play the Barbie pony game?
I didn’t realize I watched this movie also did anyone else see that bratz movie where girls get poisoned and they shrivel up and get super old looking? That was terrifying
Hear me out…monster high
It's been 2 years since he stopped the extra greeting 😭💔
19:25 Dylan twerks about it
Alright who came back right after the new Barbie movie? Can wait for round 3 w the live action matchup between Bratz and Barbie!
18:45-18:56 this was the longest 10 seconds of my life that i will never get back.
Now THIS is the original Barbie vs. Oppenheimer !
The hair is braided like a rope
Why’d they have to name the purple dragon that 😪
Something about the “Rapunzel is bald now” is making me a little emotional for some reason
ya hooo da ba yo
Well… RIP Barbie
My absolute favourite video of Kurtis❤❤
The fact that the “balls” moment in rapunzel made him pause is crazy bc I watched that Barbie movie recently with friends and for too long, our inside joke was saying “balls” in that voice 😂😂
ya hoo da ba yo (frfr)
I love how Kurtis is just getting upset at himself for making the most corny-ass jokes LIKE DUDE, NO NEED TO APOLOGISE, I'M LMAO RN
The Bratz dancing scenes and “Come on! I banished you enternally!🥺😭” made me laugh so hard that I have a headache now.
I love Bratz, they're the best, but Barbie is also so good, omg. I guess I love both.
I THOUGHT THE BRATZ MOVIE WAS JUST A REALLY WERID FEVER DREAM I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS REAL THANK YOU KURTIS FOR BRINGING ME BACK TO MY CHILDHOOD
Arbies, not looking good!
is anyone else watching this after watching the barbie movie
The gnome speaks better Irish than me and I've been learning it for 10 years 😔
Please do Barbie Nutcracker for Christmas
KIRTIS YOU FUKING DIDNT GIVE ME ENOUGH TIME TO GET A SNACK
23:39 wow… just wow.
In the icon words of Kurtis Conner “aw aw aw AHHH”
stan the horny weasel
0:26 still makes me giggle my ass off
I still love watching this video 😍
The artic monkeys moment was everything to me
i recently had a dream that had that weasel in it.
12:13 I can’t believe I watched this movie years ago with a straight face
16:28 blatent propaganda , we all know tarantino is the horniest weasel
I'm sorry I'm gonna be that guy. You NEED to compare barbie the princess and the pauper, and Bratz starrin and styling (BUT THE ORIGINAL ONE.) Those 2 are the absolute pinnacles from each franchise in my opinion.
This Bratz movie was one of favorite movies as a child for a while
this is my adhd
"...and Dylan twerks about it."
I’m now trying to watch only barbie themed YouTube videos until the new movie comes out 🥲💀💩
Monster high next dude
I laughed way too hard at the balls part 💀😭
Now there's a live action of barbie although Bratz did it first
Bratz was definitely more y2k and Barbie is just..60s aesthetic? I don’t even know. She’s just a blonde girl with random jobs
I laughed at the angry twerking for  hours 💀💀
do NOT give him that rabbit 💀
I used to watch this specific Bratz movie all the time as a kid. Loved it so much. Watched it again last year. Threw up a little bit in my mouth.
ya hooo da ba yo
fun fact, when barbie was first invented, she was also extremely controvercial and didnt become successful for a long time. she was considered inappropriate for having a job and no husband, but parents eventually started buying them because they encouraged their daughters to become interested in grooming and fashion, which was nessecary to secure a husband
The sjw version of JonTron. Not sure how you can put out so many videos while you're constantly hooked up to CNN:)
I deadass thought the vrg meant Virgo
rewatching this video when i am and seeing the title of the fake apology clip and the title being “holding myself accountable” while he says “i didn’t mean it, i was desperate” has me thinking he predicted colleen ballinger
“I’m not a virgin” immediately starts talking about his podcast
21:16 Kurtis.. what comes out of the hole isn't pee  It's clear...
The weasel ends all his sentences just like Trisha Paytas
Yknow Kurtis acts a lot like my science teacher
I think rapunzels stepmom or whatever has adhd because the statement ”i will not do the one thing that would easily solve all my problems until i absolutely have to” speaks to my adhd ass 🤡
Spyro !!!!
“He’s so hot” 7:56
that bratz movie goes so hard i will not hear anyone disagree
With barbie they always had the best accessories, like the babie airplane ,barbie pool, barbie limo, the doll house, barbie camper van ,barbie stables with horse dolls, barbie  camping. Then there are the  career relates barbies that comes with sets and accesories.  Never got into brats or myscene. Also was starting to get older around the time brats  and my scene came out.    Also was big into polly pocket as a kid.
kurtis i cant
Kelly is scarier than most modern horror movie monsters
"rapunzel is bald now" continues to be the funniest thing i've ever seen/heard
rapunzel had g force tolerance training 😂
Balls
Missed opportunity to say scrolltum
I think the gnome is saying either 'yahoo, down below' or 'yahoo, look out below' in whatever heavy accent he's supposed to have
Hedwig's a girl.
The Barbie rapunzel movie is such a core part of my childhood I have seen it so many times but not for at least 8-10 years and I have no recollection of the animation being so weird, they look like they’re in the sims 2
21:25 had no right to be that funny LMAO 😂
i assumed virgo before virgin
monster high is the winner
Cock by carrier pidgeon
now do monster high
why isn't anyone talking about how the weasel thing fucking full-on MOANS at 11:00????
6:57  OMG TESTI-SCROLLS LMAO
ARCTIC MONKEYS REFERENCE!!!!
Wood chipper? I sure would
ya hooo da ba yo (Read the entire description)
Both Barbie and Bratz had decent kid video games too. OMG, reminds of Diva Starz, they were cool dolls too and their video game was my obsession in 5th grade, lol.
Slay
my guy, i dont know a single person who likes barbie rapunzel, why choose that one when theyre so many better ones:')
B a l l s
i have actually been trying to find that bratz movie for YEARS
who will be the barbie to my bratz? :(
ViRGin
Bro i forgot that barbie movie existed
okay i did not understand the bratz movie at all
Why did the Bratz movie have so many plot holes?😭
No but the chasing scene sounds like a poorly made Roblox game
i throughly enjoyed the arctic monkeys clip please never apologize for having top tier music taste 😕😕😕
Both of these movies just unlocked core memories for me, I remember watching them and they are still bad.
..GOOD👍
Matpat actually made a video about how the climbing up the hair would kill rapunsal
WHY ARE WE PUTTING BAD BITCHES AGAINST EACHOTHER???
fun fact for y'all because I watched a YouTube vid on it ages ago, the hair itself would have been strong enough to hold up a person, its her neck that would break
you chose like one of the worser barbie movies-
dance trance? i prefer tdrance
That sneeze at the end was so beautiful, I think I'm gonna cry 🥹
Straight chungledown bim energy 21:27
If you're looking for another funny old movie wirh weird animation, happily n'ever after 1 and 2 would be so good. There are so many meme moments in the movies
6:01 bro i lowkey hated this part of the movie like “oh noooos Gothel makes Barbie do CHORES OH MY GOOSH.” Like thats what made Gothel evil. If you want a good Rapunzel movie, watch Tangled (yes ik he cant for the vid but still)
gothel is an incel
Did kurtis miss rhe part where the baby dragon couldnt fly yet and there is infact a barrier around the palace... so thats why rapunzel could never leave. Because rhe dragon couldnt fucking fly yet
king how did you not mention the fact that in barbie rapunzel she marries her literally COUSIN
HELP THE TWERKIN  PART KNOCKED ME OUT
dangit kurtis! i really wanted to watch these movies and you spoiled them!!!
23:35 -- by far my favorite clip of kurtis of all time. it is so funny for no reason.
you truly did pick the worst barbie movie for your first impression
Bro the weasel reminds me of hisoka ngl👀
You hate me? 7:42
Anyone else seeing the "required viewing" thing next to the title
6:36 11:02
Only virgins don't give extra greetings.
my country never had Bratz dolls so I grew up liking barbies instead
ok virgil
I can still hear the dragons voice it's been like 10 years
Today is the two year universary of barbie saying balls
To me The letters in the back say Verga 🤷🏻‍♂️ shout out to the Mx Residents of Kurtistown
Anyone aware of that kid in Australia, Chloe?Kidnapped and returned to her parents like 3 weeks later? Weird comment to throw out there i realize, but Bratz dolls are part of that story.   Its judgemental and....well sexest honestly, but dudes really into Bratz dolls make me uncomfortable. One or two cause ya think theyre fun? Ok. Shelves full of em? Hmmmm.
Barbie in the Princess and the Pauper is better.
The "so no Hedvig" joke killed me 😂
The fact that there are 5 min tutorials on youtube for absolutely impossible tasks like how to get abs in half an hour and Kurtis is here making a 27 min video essay titled barbie vs bratz-
6:00 10:59 Hisoka
18:40 I can’t stop thinking about this
My neice said you look like Mr beast
Bratz is the best 🦅🦅🦅🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲✨✨✨✨🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️
21:00 dogs pee on gnomes
Wouldn't rapunzels dad be the dad of the guy also?
6:42 balls
Did he do drugs?
the barbie riding camp game..i played it. IT WAS THE MOST IMPOSSIBLE GAME EVER. SO HARD. SO VERY VERY HARD. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. IT'S TOO HARD.
Those letters are an abbreviation of the word “verga” in Spanish you can’t tell me otherwise
11:05 kurtis on shrooms 21:58 kurtis got the moves
Not the Arthur knock off haha
The angry twerking I’m screaming
Literally subbed bc of this vid, the comedy is top tier
Doesn't matter, Uncle Ben; My Little Pony is better than both of 'em.
You chose the worst Barbie movie 😢😭
This is my comfort video:)
balls
💁🏼‍♀️✨Rapunzel✨💁🏼‍♀️ is 👴bald👴 😩💅nowww😩💅
scrotum scrolls will be in my next dnd campaign ty
I love that weasel
Ya hooo da ba yo
18:59 Why are you halfway done with "strangers Body Count"
As someone who was an avid barbie watcher growing up. The Weasel is not an outlier. Almost every barbie movie has a horny evil animal sidekick.   He's not even the only one who moans!
On the one hand, not a fan of the alt kid being the evil villain and knowing that when I was a little alt boy/if I was a little alt girl I would've loved being the villain of the movie.
I never understood why Instagram girls praise barbies when they do their lips and makeup like bratz dolls.
Why are they fighting in the courthouse square from Back to the Future at the end of the Bratz movie?

I always wanted a Bratz doll, I may actually buy myself one or three
This shit was so funny that I was walking around working and just snorting, doubling over trying to breathe. Caused enough of a disturbance that I RECRUITED NEW VILLAGERS TO KURTISTOWN!
Thanks kurtis for doing this
It’s ok to be a virgin Kurtis u can admit it to us 🤭🤭
If anyone is wondering more about the lawsuit, he mentioned  The lawsuit Mattel gave MGA (the company that owns brats and Mattels, competitor) was because of the fact that the idea for brats came from a Mattel worker that sold the idea to MGA and Mattel was saying that brats should be owned by them because they came from a Mattel worker because of the contract that Mattel workers must sign(I don’t know entirely about this part) saying that any idea made by Mattel worker belongs to them And then years of lawsuits and court battles, conspire Between the two companies
The entirety of that barbie movie felt like a badly made video game cutscene
Oh god I forgot about the moaning weasel-
do i wanna gnome?
ya hooo da ba yo
Here to see the creation of “bAllLs” yet again ❤
Horned weasels 🐀
"its your job to know!!" 😂😂😂
The Barbie movie was my absolute favorite as a kid
My grandma wouldn't let me watch Bratz because she thought they were too provocative and well bratty for a very impressionable child
Did you know that Barbie was based off of the makers s!x doll
"do owls get horny?"   *laughs in helluva boss fan*
Bratz Fashion Pixies... Great choice, my man
I think he can’t stop thinking about the weasel cuz his subconscious knows the he looks like the weasel😂
10:00 is crazy
I was drinking soup and then I hear the horny weasel say “MMmMMmmM” and I almost choked and died 💀
Do a Barbie vs Bratz show version.
That "so no hedwig?" Is the funniest thing ive ever heard
i find myself coming back to this video a lot
I grew up with both Bratz and Barbie and loved both of them, along with Monster High
11:50 fucking BROKE ME
The 16:14 bit should not have made me laugh as much as it did 😂
Horny Sigourney Weaver Weasel
i've laughed more than in the whole year
i need extra becuase subscrien
funny
Woah where is my extra greeting? UNSUBSCRIBE!!
I wonder if 2:52 was a Community reference
I adored all doll movies that were most likely made to sell toys but i dont care i still love them, theyre so acursed to look at its a delight
oh my god i remember loving the bratz movies as a tween
9:01 HEDWIG IS FEMALE, ITS SHE
Simbaline Sorbolene
barbied wire
I can’t stop thinking about the angry twerking
18:47 IF THIS FEELING FLOWS BOTH WAYS
LMAO to the scene (https://youtu.be/hLQZ3S7dmxk?t=588) where she's like "uh wtf dude" and he's all eager like "Do thy curtains match thy drapes?" DKM
Man I remember being a kid and I didn’t get playing with Barbies or Bratz. Because I’m not like most girls (this is a joke- I was a cringe horse girl and I’m well aware of my place here okay). But I vaguely remember some girl I was friends with invited me to her “Barbie themed party” and it was a BIG deal that it was BARBIE themed and not Bratz themed.
Fun fact: the weight of Rapunzel's hair would have pulled itself out of her scalp by now so you don't have to wonder whether or not the man climbing her hair would hurt
DUDE I CANT CHOOSE
I prefer the original barbies.
It took me entirely too long to see this video 😂😂The angry twerking had me falling on the floor.
if rapunzel was trans, you could say "rapunzel has balls now"  you can now clap
Ohhh I'm in tears about the angry twerking 😭😂
Fun fact : the VA of the weasel in the barbie Rapunzel movie is the same guy that voiced goku. 😃
Lol
Omg I feel like I’m the only one who liked Barbie better than Bratz. But I think that’s because I had so many Barbies and all the movies on disc and I always thought she looked just like me(even though she didn’t). I’m way to old for Barbies now and I still buy them and buy Barbie themed clothes:)
OMG I REMEMBER THE BARBIE MOVIE  old memories unlocked 🔓
My Spanish speaking ass always thinks of "verga" when I see VRG
Which dolls had no feet? They just had stubs when you pulled the shoes off. Wasnt it Bratz?
I used to think V R G stood for Virtual Reality Games 😅
The starting scene in Bratz with the two girls and their.. dad?? 100% those people smoke weed and were sharing an off camera blunt
10:15 my face when i poop myself
Why did you have to pick the worst barbie movie too, any other movie and it would have at least gotten a 5/10
The fact that man twerks about it had me in tears
It's been almost two years since this came out and "~Rapunzel is bald now~" still pops in my head at the most unexpected moments.
I hope this video gets played at my funeral.
“do i wanna gnome” is one of the funniest things over ever heard in my fucking life😭😭
I can't believe he didn't add the Wilhelm scream
ya hooo da ba yo 😘😘😍😍😛😛😛😍😍WHAT IS HAPPENINF
Its barbje no competition
21:58 i havwnt stopped laughing thisnsi so fuckin funny
Kelly looks like a Sims 3 character
Kurtis picked the WOST barbie movie and the funniest bratz movie
DO A MONSTER HIGH MOVIEEEEEE
I dunno how old the Barbie movie is but there's a weird lack of vegetation. There's like a few token trees but when she looks over the entire village, there's nothing but grass-colored rock.
Then I'll unsubscribe for this video bcz there is no extra greeting
Bratz fashion pixies used to be my all time fav movie tbh
i shouldntve tapped 1
Barbie's dragon pal in Rapunzel was a BAD FRIEND.. He's a freaking DRAGON and should have flown her out of her tower prison
pretty sure you are a verson. 🤡
Omg when I was young I had all of the Barbie and brutz movies cds. I’m so old now like man I finished school 6 years ago 😢😢😢 I remember how I watched it like a million times and now I feel nostalgia 💔
Ive watched this video more than any barbie or bratz movies before, we're still waiting for u to make new vids like this Kurtis. Love from Brazil!
balls
i loved both of these movies as a child
small soldiers freaked me out as a kid bc of them stabbing people with tacs
7:57  I literally died 😂😂😂😂😂
I dont know why but i liked bratz dolls more then barbies cuz bratz dolls didnt have feet and had things to put the shoes on
i've watched barbie as rapunzel like 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times i swear.  looking back at this comment, this video is bringing so many memories holy crap. update 3 : kelly does'nt have a 4-head, she has a 80-head
ngl that footstep song hit hard
Fun fact: Barbie came from a German sex doll prank gift
I had to pause the video during the bit with the angry dancing person, because of how much I was laughing.
I am a virginity and here are  little my mom is 🧑‍🦯👨‍🦽🧟‍♂️ piz donated to me to help he see and move she has been like this for all her life.
wtf is this
Rapunzel is bald now
Rapunzel is no bald now
Kurtis bald looks like a plumber who lives in a trailer park married to a woman named sunflower and they have 5 kids
12:24 Hey! It's the General's Son from Berserk Golden Age.   Oh God, Kurtis, get him out of there, GET HIM OOOOOUT
I thought he would say chip her I hardly know her
RAPUNZEL IS BALD NOWWWW
I am so excited for the new Barbie movie.  It's going to be fire.         (Seriously I didn't understand that there was a new Barbie movie coming out so I didn't know why everyone was making Barbie posters of their favorite fictional characters. But then I went to the movies and I saw the trailer and it looks amazing. What a fool I was.)
Only HTF has shown a realistic depiction of someone climbing up Rapunzels hair
9:04 so no "head"wig?
As a guy who grew up with 3 sisters.....this is weirdly nostalgic.
Ok, I’m not proud of this fact but…..I laughed EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. the “balls” sound clip happened.   Anyone else?
I would never chose barbie or bratz over my go to, monster high.
Omg the Bratz movie was so amazing as a kid too
Barbie as rapunzel FYE
Happy 420 home dawg! This is a great commentary to watch 🍃😂
Yahoo da ba yo! Dunno how no one else caught that
One of the barbie shows was actually pretty funny.   They couldn't use the word  "frisbee" so they called it "generic flying disc".
myscene was best of both worlds
irish gnome 🔛🔝
ya hooo da ba yo
I’m going to be that person but the hair thing is easy. It’s like when you hold your hair and brush the end. You could anchor the hair and make the tension spot NOT her scalp.
The bratz fashion pixies is my CHILDHOOD
One of the shows I watched as a kid that scared me was called Truth or Scare
STEPHANS HANDS FITTING COMPLETELY AROUND BARBIES WAIST WAS SO DISTURBING
If you had the hair wrapped around a supporting thing like how she seems to have it wrapped around the pillar of the window, I imagine it wouldn't be painful. If you hold a section of your hair tightly, then pull the part sectioned off by the part you're holding, if I worded that in a way that conveys what I'm trying to say, it doesn't hurt. It would probably work the same way for rapunzel, just a lot more hair supporting a lot more weight. Besides, her hair alone probably weighs more than him anyways.
My bone to pick with Rapunzel is that she could've escaped herself if she tied her hair at the top of the tower then repelled down with scissors.
So like the new Barbie movie is out… where is the live action reviews????😢
I'm... I was obsessed with the barbie movies as a kid, I in no way remember the animation being that bad - I mean just the colours are awful.
"Rapunzel is bald now" -best kurtis barbie quote -2022
whenever the live action barbie comes out you need to make another one of these with that and the live action bratz
he should do a fashion fairytale or a fairy secret plsss
THE DANCING IN THE BRATZ MOVIE KILLED ME BRO IM DYING
“No hedwig?”   Killed me idk why 💀
"I'm gonna piss on you!" Had me dieing 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bro I love your jokes and vibe. I'm subbing because you could make a BARBIE review interesting and funny. I clicked randomly from the recommendations on the side, thinking, 'A Barbie vs. Bratz video? This couldn't possibly be interesting, let's see how bad it is.' Then boom, hilarious content.
imagine how big his eyes where when he was born
was the bratz movie animated in roblox??
the fact that the film had to be cleared by so many people & in the end the moaning weasel was kept in
This is like the 7th time I rewatch this video 😂
I still think of this video randomly and I burst out laughing once on the bus lol
you should watch "Barbie: A Fairy Secret" it is so much better than the rapunzel one.
omg of course owls get horny, that's literally what the "breeding season" is. All vertebrates and arthropods get horny, probably others too. During said season, the specific amount of sunlight lets the brain know that it is the correct time to start producing hormones and that's when non-human animals get hormonal aka...horny. That's it. There is no difference between us and them. So there you go, in case you were curious.
still one of your all time best videos
im not a jerk youre a jerk
You missed Penelope's whole arc for why she didn't initially fly over the magic wall! The reason Penelope didn't do it earlier was because she had to overcome her fear of heights and her anxiety of disappointing her father 🥺Loved Barbie as Rapunzel as a kid 🥰  I was not a Bratz fan as a child admittedly (did not like their giant heads). They definitely had a unique style tho and added some nice diversity to the 2000s doll market.
24:53
I’m not sure what it is about his sense of humor but every Kurtis video leaves me absolutely WHEEZING
Yoo hoop da ba yooo
ya hooo da ba yo
This video is soooo funny and nostalgic lol
Arctic monkeys are chasing me istg
Both of these movies were huge staples in my childhood. Thanks so much for making a hilarious video about them 😂
Sigorny Horny Weasel Weaver
U did arctic monkeys dirty 😭
Balls 😀  But dude how funny would it be to just use this out of context... Like, A friend being like: "oh hey man, whattya doin?"  😀"Ballz"  "Um, okay I jus-"  "Balls"😃
21:26 I have no words, just wheezes
The Bratz Halloween slumber party movie was my CHILDHOOD but so was Barbie with a Fairy Secret and so many other Barbie movies I did enjoy some Bratz, but Barbie definitely made more things I liked and I don’t think I’ve ever owned a Bratz doll
Long ass hair?
Where I came from, if you had a big forehead, your best friend is the sun🌞
In my ballet class they said our outfit looked like the last Barbie outfit in the cutscene of her changing outfits and I swear when she said balls I laughed so hard
9:34 i think there’s a film theory about that
OiM gONna PiSs oN yEww😂
Tell me why a year after I watched this I am just now realizing when Kurtis makes the "Do I wanna gnome" joke that the song behind it is "Do I wanna know" by Arctic Monkeys
12:43 to be honest if the voices were more serious this would sound pretty intense even with no music
18:14 why did they make the gnome say “cailíníS” when cailíní is already plural??
8:15 "the king who ordered that" **points to giant fucking hole in the ground** WHY WOULD HE ORDER THAT LMAO
I loved Bratz, and the movies were great. But my mom wouldn't buy them for my sister because you could detach their hands and feet and I kept eating them. But I loved seeing the gnome! My favourite Bratz movie was the fairytale story collection with the funky frog and the gnomes were like rappers or something, it was glorious
Man I watched all the Barbie movies and I forgot how awful this movie looked XD
Kurtis Hedwig is a female owl so do with that what you will
Rapunzel and Fashion Pixies were my favourite!
And from this day forward, Kurtis never did an extra greeting again.
21:58
stefan kinda looks like danny
18:08 this made me laugh way more than it should. "Hehe thanks doesn't help"
kurtis everyone knows girls dont fart!!!!!
i loved barbie Rapunzel now i see how horrid it was😭
in the rapunzel barbie movie i legit paused it and took a second, thought it out, barbies head is wider than her waist in that dress. oml
Bratz gave 5-8 y/o me actual nightmares.. more specifically ’Bratz Kidz Sleepover Adventure’.. I still rewatched it multiple times 😭
i got a bratz ad on this
i used to think that the head they we’re talking about in that vine was a drug till 8th grade
6:27 I GOT A BRATZ AD
barbie all the way
7:52 Holy shit his hands went the whole way around her waist without even trying! What the fuck?! How did I miss that as a kid? His thumbs overlap, which means her waist is smaller than the size of his hands into a circle. Which isn't very much at all.
He should’ve watched Barbie Island Princess because that is the best oneeeee. Or twelve dancing princesses
balls
I liked this movie :,[
Ugh I used to live all those movies when I was little..modern Barrie movies are crap. I wanna see him react to the island princess bc what he’d think of Tika 😘
OH MY DAYS THEY’RE ALICORNS, ALICORNS
Pleaseeeee please pleaseeeee do barbie san lake(THERE IS MORE KELLY 🥰🥰) vs Draculaura Sweet 1600!!!!
18:32 ok but imagine a gnome COMING TO LIFE AND CHASING YOU... i would run too
you should do the worst ones of both franchises
As a kid I always viewed Bratz dolls as ratchet Barbie dolls and when a kid gave me some as a gift I literally never even attempted to play with them. I didn’t let it show but I was so upset because for my birthday in kindergarten I got NOTHING but Bratz dolls. This was at the height of their popularity too. And even at 5 I hated them and thought they were over sexualized. I hated their lips and noseless faces. Now that’s ironically a look about them I think is cute. It’s funny because now as an adult I love Bratz dolls and think they’re super cute. I also don’t think they’re overtly sexualized (Now Bratz babies is a dif story…) But I did when I was little. My conservative American flag wielding grandmother was proud of me for snubbing my nose up at Bratz dolls 😂, I was defiantly as Barbie girl. I also loved Groovy Girls. Probably love Groovy Girls and Liv Dolls the very most, even more then Barbie.
I never realized how "horni" Barbie as Rapunzel was XD thanks for ruining my innocent childhood memories by such a great humor!
does he know about winx :D
This movie made me curious, so I looked up what sound a weasel makes because if they actually make sounds like that in real life, then it makes sense why it's in a kids movie, they're just mimicking the sound a weasel makes. The funny thing is, weasels don't make sounds like that freaking shoulder weasel...  They sound like this: https://youtu.be/EJSnaN2PFDw
I now understand why parents rushed into the room every time that weasel spoke💀
favorite kurtis vid
2:42 Oh Kurtis, haven't you heard that women don't fart? /s Also the Barbie Rapunzel animation is *way* jankier than I remember it as a kid lmaoooo. I seem to remember that Penelope couldn't fly properly so her saving Rapunzel was a huge thing for her at the end??
i promise you there is alway a moaning, horny animal in every single barbie movie. at least one, sometimes more.
I love bratz so much lol
do i wanna gnome? no body nose
Your content has been making me laugh in my lowest lately, thanks so much 😂😂 been a sub for a few days now 😌🙌
I distinctly remember a time when I was like 6 and the bratz pixie movie came on at a sleepover while everyone was asleep except for me. Watching the bratz gang turn a tree into their mom as a tired first grader was the most vividly trippy moment in my life
Is it almost time for another one of these
Barbie and Kelly? WHERE IN THE ABSOLUTE HELL, IS SKIPPER!?
I come back to this video every so often and every single time the Kelly slander makes me cackle
Barbie and Bratz's movies were my childhood!! 🥰 but now seeing Kurtis react to this I'm dying 😂 couldn't help to make a joke about BALLS
22:05 this whole edit felt like a fever dream      made me queef a little though...
I'm sorry. Throughout this 30-minute video, the only thing I could think about was Barbie's little sister and the comments made. I'm still laughing.
I was super into Bratz, in part because they had more than just a bland no personality Ken doll, they had a bunch of Bratz Boyz and they had their own distinctive styles just like the girls
Personal time stamps  2:49  26:23 26:32
This is peak kurtis I’m sorry, I’ve rewatched this video so many times, I quote it all the time with my bf and I loved these movies growing up, this is an amazing video
ya hoo da ba yo
do i wanna gnome 😭😭
Headwig is a girl
I love boby flay
i had no reason getting so happy when kurtis said “do i wanna gnome” maybe bc its my favorite song 🫶
Ya hooo da ba yo
I wanna say, bratz DOLLS were better but Barbie movies were superior. Barbie movies had so much magic and wonderful soundtracks. Bratz dolls slayed in outfits, inclusivity and each girl’s uniqueness.
Dude, I did not realize how much the music and lines from fashion pixies lived deep in my subconscious for all this time... Like the blizzard flashback just really stuck with me so much for absolutely no reason....  The Bratz movie I watched the most though was Bratz Kidz sleepover adventures (I think that's what it was called?) Idk if anyone else watched that but for some reason I was really into it. There was also a Bratz babiez movie featuring aliens...? And I think the Bratz babies had super powers? Yeah, the Bratz lore is wild haha you have only just scratched the surface
Omg I love our boy Kurtis! He’s one of only a few youtubers that make me laugh from beginning to end in his videos 🥰.
*“Rapunzel is bald nowwww 🥰🥰❤️”*
I took a sip of water as you did the bit about the horny weasel and had a near death experience
Was it just me, or did the Barbie plot make more sense? I'm so confused about the Bratz plot....
wood chipper? i hardly know her.
the irish gnome is the scariest thing ever
wait you should review monster high movies because their dolls and movies are also so cool
the weasel moans are forever stuck in my head
Is this “that one time”?
If you're not pulling the hair straight from the head, then no it wouldn't hurt. Which is why in the Disney movie, she used a hook, because that puts the pressure on the hair, and not her scalp. So if you hold your hair at the halfway point or whatever, then someone pulls the end, it wouldn't hurt assuming it was the same amount of pressure. Like a pulley system type of deal
As a arctic monkeys fan I will never forget or forgive 😢
The best Barbie movie is actually "Barbie and the nutcracker" no it not my favorite (my favorite is Barbie and the 12 dancing princess) but it is objectively the best
"Oh no he's hawt!!!!" Lmao 😂😂😂
You have no idea how long I've been looking for that Bratz movie Kurtis. All I could remember is pixies, a rave in a tree and magic glasses. I couldn't remember anything else. Thank you.
testiscrolls
The nightmares I'm about to have about gnomes...
What you said about Bratz being more inclusive with other skin stones is what made me want one in the first place. As a kid, all my Barbies looked the same, and then I got my Yasmin doll and she had tan skin, brown hair and brown eyes. She instantly became my favorite doll and I would take her with me everywhere. I still have her with me. That’s a part of my childhood that I don’t wanna let go because it really lit up my life at the time
I'm so glad that he to is also haunted by the moans of the weasel, I thought I was alone
giev herr two meeahhh 😩
The angry pixie dancing will forever be hilarious.
I couldn't have Bratz because they were "ghetto".
Favorite timestamps: (yes i have no life) 0:23 "Could a virg1n have a podcast? ... yeah probably but i-" 1:04 "* talking about action figures coming to life * Did it work?.....

She has no asshol3 🤨" 2:50 "introducing ultra realistic Barbie!! Now with functional assh0le!
Excited for the release of the full version of Do I️ Wanna Gnome
Quite the fulfilling contest of how Barbie's second venture into the public domain beats a Bratz movie about fab fairies entering modern day. Btw, Angelica Hudson plays Gothel in this movie. It was until the early 2010s when they gave up for hiring celebrities in a Barbie movie, too expensive I guess, especially for the company behind Reboot that animated this, Mainframe Entertainment.
“Doth thou carpets match thy drapes?” killed me lmao
If you think the repunzle Barbie movie was funny, watch Barbie the swan princess
Does anyone know where the bag is from ? 😁
18:45 lives rent free in my head
I ended up watching both Barbie and Bratz a lot as a kid thanks to my sister, I think this might be nostalgic for me
Thank you for showing respect for our beloved  90's girl culture while managing to make fun of it.
19:44
Folklore facts:  Gnome hats are the inspiration for butt plugs. The more ya know 🌈✨
In the real movie she have a hook that she puts her hair on that's why doesn't hurt in the real movie, I don't know about the Barbie one
i thought the first barbie movie was a fever dream lmaooo
Kurtis we need you to watch Barbie as Swan Lake please
Kurtis NOT A VIRGIN Conner
WE NEED A PART 3
lets all be so real. that mom in bratz is so fine.
Wow. I'm an adultish type person with an interest in many shades of weirdness --including toy and doll collecting AND hilarious if not slightly awkward comedians with hilarious if not slightly awkward choices in both head and facial hair. Welcome to the most specific sliver of a venn diagram ever. You live there. And it seems pretty rad.
WEASEL CUM?! XD I CANNOT - 😂
I don’t even have to watch the video Barbie solos
"flying unicorns"? Good sir, those are alicorns, smh
Bratz is one thing zillennials can claim 😘😘
ery eally ood
We have lots of barbie cds out here man, Those are the shites. I won't stand for this kurtis
I need Kurtis to do a review of one of the baby bratz movies, either sleepover or superheroes
You had my like at  "Do I wanna gnome"
WHY IS THE GNOME IRISH???
Bless you
*Gets war flashbacks to the forehead discussions in the Splatoon fandom*
12:18 this part made me laugh so hard my stomach actually started hurting
VeRGa
tbh mariposa is better than rapunzel
The joke about women tryint to look lke big lipped, big eyed ducks would have landed in an alternate universe I wish I lived in.
ITS CHELSEA
OOOOOH so THIS is the origin of the "BALLS" meme :O
I'm pretty sure I watched most of the Bratz movies and I don't even know all the Barbies movies that do exist  But I DO have more barbie dolls and zero bratz dolls   That being said- I'm pretty sure I hace more Monster and Ever After High dolls and they were more fun to play with   So  I dunno
Omg! Every time I try to catch my breath I end up laughing more!
because of how much hair she allegedly had, it actually would not hurt, it's pretty interesting
The reason Rapunzel's hair doesn't hurt is because she ties her hair to part of the tower. I am pretty sure that is not what happened in the first original story, but in the later ones and this movie too.
I never watched Barbie Rapunzel but I had the computer game when I was little and I think I would literally beat the game every single by how obsessed I was with it. But definitely a Bratz girl through and through haha. Barbie Princess and the Pauper though is better than any Bratz movie, but Bratz in general is better than Barbie in general.
my gasp when he said barbie rapunzel cuz that was one of the ones i owned as a kid and the first one i watched i watched that movie so many times probably played a significant role in my development
THIS IS WHERE THE BALLS SOUND EFFECT IS FROM????
doth thy curtains match thy drapes?
show us the My Scene dolls
virgin virginner
Ive never seen a Bratz movie but the Barbie Rapunzel movie took me back. I haven't seen that in years
I have watched this video so many times because it is a fucking masterpiece
Bratz definitely wins
Wood chipper? I hardly know ‘er!
I love how the Bratz randomly gave the evil pixies weird gray skintones. It feels really similar to MGA giving every Shadow High character in the Rainbow High universe weird greyscale or other unnatural skintones for no apparent or lore related reason...
I actually like that when Sasha and Yasmin put on the pixie glasses everything becomes more colorful. Like yeah, there’s bubbles and people with wings, but the vivid colors is a more subtle detail that shows the difference between the regular world and the pixie’s world. Even the regular humans get a bit more color saturation when viewed through those glasses.
ngl... the footsteps in barbie slap. Ive always loved them for some reason. Still obsessed with that sound 10+ years later
honestly, I *really* want him to make a video on the fever dreams that are The Nuttiest Nutcracker and Barbie Swan Lake
Yo it’s Rick astley
Headwig is a she 😡😡😡😡
"rapunzel is bald now 🎶" is objectively the funniest sentence
The anus from "barbie with an asshole" is the flag from community 2:52
I had no idea Bratz made movies lol
i was a nerd back in school who never skips school. i remember taking a day off to watch new barbie movie one Saturday. And my memory its quality was better than this
the way he freaks out every time a young character comes in😭😭
Bring bushy mustache Kurtis back
I love this video, but that Rapunzel movie was an older movie so of course it would have bad animation, I suggest doing a part 2 and watching Barbie Magic of the Rainbow.
I was OBSESSED with barbie as rapunzel as a kid and I never realized how weird the weasel was until this video
Was a big Barbie and Bratz fan as a child. Just got whiplash from rewatching these scenes.
This is Kurtis' magnum opus
9:31 as someone who used to have hair down to my knees, it doesn’t hurt at all when you pull the ends, the closer you get to the scale it does hurt, but the “prince” never gets close enough anyways. It would probably hurt 10 times more tho since he’s putting all his weight on it but idk
bro that gnome is my science teacher but with more hair
21:37
I'm loving his beef with kelly
✨Hot pixie king dad✨
I fucking lived of Barbie movies when I was little (I was born in the early 2000's) The Rapunzel movie was one of my favorites, but the weasel always gave me the creeps
Yo HOOOOOOO da ba yo 👹💪🤩💅👀😚😁😋🤪UNH🤪😋😁😚👀💅💪👹
I love Barbie, but Bratz did so much for me...
the second movie was my favorite all my childhood
Omg I watched Rapunzel in Russian as a kid. And the weasel was never that horny XDDDDDDD
Petition to have kurtis re edit all his old videos with any mention of *balls* and change it to the one with the reverb
I mean, if Barbie's saying is "You can be anything," then they should give her realistic body proportions because little girls might think that they have to be skinny to fulfill their dream of being a doctor or whatever.
idk who are you but im leaving subscribtion
Horny weasel has me crying
1:53 the barbied-wire joke has not gotten the appreciation it deserves 😔
I adore barbie as rapunzel and I will hear no slander!! the plot twists and magic and everything is so goof. weasel is weird, but iconic.
That garden gnome gave me issues
no if u wrap your hair around something and hold from the other side prob wouldnt hurt that much
New sub here. Been watching through videos. And this one made me laugh the most so far. I couldnt breath. I was in the middle of painting and had to stop the video.  Thank you!!!!
Hi
Honestly all the bratz movies I watched felt like a fever dream the bratz kids sleepover movie honestly had me convinced I made it up until like a year ago when I accidentally fell upon it again. What a vibe
when I was little, my favorite movie was the barbie rapunzel one, and i still love the sound effects in the ballroom- idk if it's nostalgia but they just hit different man- (also i was creeped out by the weasel and kelly-and yes, all the kids in barbie movies from that era looked like that-)
ok seriously wth did that gnome say at 24:54
Can you please talk about monster high!!!!!!
I strive to be a Monster High doll
can we talk about that do i wanna gnome joke and the absolute regret on kurtis' face afterward
16:21 yo is that John Williams
brats is so much better than barbie
watched this video with my gf and now we´re not vrg´s anymore
Bless you.
y'know it'sa time you nosy caleenies got yerselves a million miles away from here!

promiscuous ferret!
21:27 I’M GONNA PISS ON YOU
The Waffle House has found its new host.
BRATZ dolls wins anyday, but the barbie movies were amazing
It only frustrates me that monster high got affected cause of mattel's stupid life decisions. They better restock those g1 reproductions(creeproductions) cause that's the only interesting thing rn in their recent promotions of monster high.
I love you , text?
You’re a cutie ❤
I'll go fall into one of the many holes dug by Kurtis  🕳️
the Bratz dolls and animation are SOOOOOOOO GOSHDARN ugly. like they are terrifying.
"So no head? Wig."
all i could think about the last few minutes of barbie's rapunzel was wanting to correct you on Hedwig the owl, who's a girl, but alas 'tis a video
they only show stefan running. WHEN IS HE NOT RINNING!!
Hey Kurt, Kurt boy, Kurt man, Kurt homie  Can ya please do a reaction vid to the really old show called “Totally Obsessed” it’s like My Strange Addiction but the first one ☝️ 😊
ok but like I used to have a crush on Cymbeline in Bratz Fashion Pixies and I still do
I CANT 25:05
Bong Joon Ho was robbed of the Best Horny Weasel Oscar.
Give them to meeeee ugghhhhnnnnn
i walk around my house singing *rapunzel is bald now* consistently
7 mins in and you made me laugh every second 🤣 you’re fucking hilarious, where have you been? 🤣
I'm 30 and still find childish jokes hilarious.
Bratz lover for life
Could a Virgin have a podcast? Well yeah, alpha males have podcasts all the time
"Come on! I banished you eternally!"  "She said she was 12!!"
Why does this dude give me Joe Keery vibes?
Okay I just have to say I watched the movie as a kid (the barbie one 😭) she couldn't escape from the start because the freaking dragon didn't know how to freaking fly 😭
It wouldn’t hurt as long as there’s tension between the scalp and the hair. The same way if you hold your hair and your fist if you pull the ends, it won’t hurt. She has it tied around the window so It’s pulling on her hair, not her scalp.
At 25:37 I realized kurtis kinda looks like a gnome
Sir Kurtis,  On behalf of the Barbie™️ Industry, I would like to make it clear that you have chosen subjectively one of the most bland Barbie™️ movies to try and justify which one is better. If you would like to adequately compare these two franchises, I would encourage you to search for some of the better movies from the Barbie™️ franchise. Some of these better movies include: -Barbie™️ in the twelve dancing princesses -Barbie™️ as the princess and the pauper -Barbie™️ as the island princess -Barbie™️ of swan lake -Barbie™️: fairytopia  -Barbie™️: mermaidia  -Barbie™️: mariposa  -Barbie™️: princess charm school -Barbie™️: the princess and the popstar  -Barbie™️: mariposa and the fairy princess -Barbie™️ And the secret door -Barbie™️: spy squad All of the Barbie™️ Movies above have stronger plot points, better stories, and better characters than the extremely predictable age old story of rapunzel. I urge you to call upon a rematch to justify Barbie™️. I grew up watching some of these earlier movies and a lot of the older ones still bring me immense joy upon re watching them. I trust that you can pick a movie that will set this right.  Sincerely,  Garlic bread 🍞
bratz always will be the champion of doll companies. ema mattel
So many villains in Barbie movies have this super annoying animal sidekick and they always seem super sleazy and horny
Amazing how the Bratz entire movie is basically "what if the medieval dance plague was actually a rave?"
Balls 6:34
Kurtis should add a Monster High movie into the mix
Barbie saying «Balls» lives rent free in my head
Ahhhhhh oh sorry saw Kelly
ya hooo da ba yo
Chipper, I hardly know her
please react to the twevils
the my scene dolls were always my fav
Technically Bratz sued Mattel first because of Myscene collection, but Mattel counter sued saying the man who came up with Bratz worked for Mattel and knew Myscene was in the works before leaving and coming up with Bratz.
Stoppp Rapunzel was my fave Barbie movie
I really loved bratz in childhood but... I started feeling really insecure about my "small" head 😬💀💀💀
The fucking echo filter on the "Balls" gets me every single time XD
As soon as he said Barbied wire I immediately started recreating it in Paint 3D I’ve been doing it for the past 14 minutes
Kelly needs bangs
That Bratz doll 'angerly throwing back' has to be one the of FUNNIEST things I've seen in a while
25:32 kurtis: "I don't have any daughters"  every lesbian in the world: 😔
For me bratz win because of inclusivity and much more edgier unique style Barbie is boring that doesn't mean I don't love older Barbie movies
what is the name of this bratz doll film
I love watching a twenty-something-year-old man make fun of a kid's movie for some strange reason.
the letters behind kurtis stand for verga
it's like a mix of Cinderella and Repunzal. KELLY NO
21 21 21 the bratz are 21 this year, including me 💋
Hedwig was a girl btw
BRATZ VS MONSTER HIGH NOWWW
7:42 IM DEAD 😂
I’m like in my twenties and idk why every time I get sick I still watch the Barbie movies….like if I’m not sick I don’t want to watch them but the second I get sick I sit in bed all day watching them 😂
Why does the movement in the Barbie movie feel so similar to the movement in dragon age to me?
Who's coming here after the Barbie Trailer?
21:19 like dogs pee on fie hydrants
18:09 yeah cause in some movies they are blood thirsty monsters, so…
Bratz was basically the iconic Y2K  doll and Barbie was still stuck in the 70s as far as fashion and inclusivity goes. I think Bratz was more inclusive of the black community and their pop culture contributions to that area of 1990/2000s as far as style, skin tone, fashion etc. Bratz were what cool girls had. It’s that era feel for some reason. When I got older and Monster High dolls came out I lost my mind. I was just a little too old for dolls but I adored them because they were gothic and cool and different. I also remember Moxie dolls being super cool. They were a mix of Bratz dolls with big heads/eyes/lips but they had detachable wigs (like Polly pockets of the era) AND they were bendable/posable with better proportions than Barbie. Barbie was JUST beginning to make bendable and posable Barbie’s en mass at the time from what I can remember, and there wasn’t much difference in body composition. I think a few years back I saw a thicker Barbie. I think she was advertised as “Mom” Barbie which tbh kind of rude. She had thicker thighs and waist essentially. I also saw recently a disco Barbie, she had an Afro and a really cool dress! But I’m unsure if it was a Mattel doll. I think Barbie did help with encouraging young girls to pursue stem fields, and encouraged girls to pursue higher education. My favorite Barbie from my childhood was one of the “Surfer” Barbies. They had proportionally big feet that did not fit into Barbie shoes. She was a black Barbie and smelled like coconuts and honestly she was cool and pretty AF. Like her hair was amazing. Looking back, a little weird that she was a surfer Barbie and there wasn’t just a regular black Barbie, but I think I was 8 at the time so what can you do. I really do like that Mattel has branched out with their inclusivity in their doll lines, but I think when it comes to girl’s toys, everything is going to be scrutinized heavily about “what it is teaching them”. It’s sort of ridiculous the type of pressure that’s out there and I don’t feel that there is the same heavy stigmatism around boys action figures. I think that people will be people, and have insecurities, no matter if they play with a 1950s Barbie or a 2022 Barbie, or if they play with a G.I. Joe or a WWE wrestling figure. We put too much pressure on obtaining perfection in the culture, regardless of toys and what they look like.
Finally. The showdown I have been waiting for my entire life.
5,559,552 That's a lot of 5's, 5 of them to be exact. 5 5's
I'm back for the weasel
bratz fashion pixies was a fucking bop
The "do I want to gnowm?".joke did it. I'm now a subscriber. Thanks, Kurtis.
How does Barbie fart? I instantly said through her joints? 😂😂
VeRGa
i really appreciated do i wanna gnome
Best spent 30 minutes of my life, thank you for this! 😂😂😂😂
Kurtis, please drop the full version of repunzel is bald now🤗🤗🤞🤞
barbie better
"That's like if someone pushed you into a pool, as a prank, and then you just went limp and drowned" i'm imagining a new kind of guy whos so dramatic and petty that he does this, but I keep arriving at the realization that's just Michael Scott
"Bratz dolls are the sluts in every Barbie dream house" is objectively hilarious
Bro that weasle was a freak
This whole video was hilarious but I nearly cried laughing at the Bratz doll angrily twerking 😭😭
gotta love the robot chicken reference at 10:03
I’m here again because I needed footage to confirm white people have no rhythm
Technically speaking if the gnome is a fire hydron then that means the gnome wasn't yelling at them but a fire hydron was yelling Irish at them
Is it me or during your apology did I hear the song Taste?
simpaline
As a kid when I watched this with my mom she kept laughing at the weasel part and I had no idea why
nobody never buy u are a virgin not with this mustache no way and I mean...i mean it
bratz movie better sorry
i come back here everytime i feel like not being on earth & i nearly cry laughing- you’re a gift from god kurtis
I’m dying at the balls part omfg
kurtis hedwig was a girl
The only thing I liked about the Barbie movie was King Wilhelm's voice.
DO I WANNA GNOME
Me: Laughing through this entire video Also me: Fixated on Kurtis mentioning Hedwig as a male owl 🙃
11:44 TO BE FAIR,,, same
For those that hate working daily: Henry ford established the 5 day;40hour work week (for his staff only) in 1926 and shortly after other companies followed suit and now we have to wake up early everyday and work our lives away.
my entire reaction/response to this whole video is: Hedwig is a girl.
The way I listen to the Bratz song almost daily and I am in fact, in a trance, every. Time.
Sitting trough those movies to have an important and rational discussion on which one is better seems like torture. You did great! Hope the recovery didn't take too long 🥺
This was my favorite Barbie movie 😭
Hmm, I didn't know Rapunzel had long ass-hair, too. The more you know.
I love Small Soldiers, I still have the vhs and I recently bought the blue ray version 🥰
I watched these movies, I actually loved them but yeah I get it lmao. Oh there's also a reason that the dragon doesn't help because she couldn't fly by than, she was a baby dragon I think.
I think Barbie is way better
14:39
PleAse please do more of these. Specifically the Barbie movies 😂
o my god i cried laughing at this 😭😭😭
now I cant listen to that song without hearing "do i wanna gnome" thanks kurtis
6:33 THERE IT IS. The legend was born!
Hedwig is a girl
Brooo i fcking died😄😄😄💀 10:07 "doth thou carpet match thy drapes😆💀"
AHHH BRO i forgot to say last time Hell yes because these 2 movies are two of my most favorite childhood movies of all time And since both Bratz and Barbie were such huge part of my childhood, I just have to say really quick that comparing Barbie to Bratz is kind of like Comparing a cottage core girl to a goth girl They both have exquisite taste, it just depends on what you’re in the mood for But anyway, i’m so glad you’re a lad of culture, thank you so much for this
I’m a Barbie girl in a Barbie world.
She didn't fly away bc she has a fear of heights!!
i SWEAR TO GOdDDD Kurtis not saying "Folks" is making my OCD go crazy
I love Barbara Millicent Roberts, everyone’s favorite LA resident originally from rural Wisconsin                 Edit: this is actually her real name and backstory btw
Barbie voice with reverb: “BALLS”   Bottom text
I need a Shrek 2 vs Shark Tale Video !!!
When the extra greeting died in this video…
Ya hooo da ba yo. To you kurtis
As an Irish person this scares me 18:24
16:40 I swear I thought he said “she’s a transfesto”
I watched this entire video, start to end, and have no idea what was going on in either movie.
this is my favorite kurtis video
Happy congrats on ur wedding brosky🫶🏽🫶🏽
wood chipper? i hardly know her.
“Do I wanna gnome” made me choke literally
what.. what happened to dylan
Can I just say that the guy who voiced the horny ferret also voiced Goku 😭😭
Ya hooo da ba yo

I came back to this video, and as soon as I took a sip of my chunky chocolate smoothie, he made the 'barbie's asshole' joke. I FEEL SICK. WHYYYYYYYYYYYY
Time stamps for the moaning weasel:  5:49 10:53
This entire video is what a manic episode feels to me
Lol when i was scrolling by the video at first i thought the "vs" on top of your head was a princess crown😂😂
He will never see Bibble 😭
ya hooo da ba yo
Ball scrolls 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The Horny Weasel is all I came for-
The squelch and weasel stain really solidified for me
hedwig is a gal owl
I truly loved Bratz with a passion
fashion pixies is the best motherfucking movie ever.
I remember chalk zone! 🤣❤️🍈🥥
Did anyone else think of Pauly Shore when he said "horny weasel" you should watch Encino Man next lol
6:35
i have a big forehead and... don't say that please, we can do absolutely norhing about it
i like bratz more ,they have better movies 😂
For any nana fans this Barbie is hachis va
overall Bratz were never sexualized, but i had the Bratz babies twin set with phoebe and roxxy and they had full makeup and *thong* diapers, which was super weird in hindsight
Wouldn't break it would hurt a lot her hair wouldn't fall out or anything like that she could pick up two elephants if you wanted to with her hair but it would still hurt
hey man. twerking is serious business.
You look like if billy hargrove had a younger brother but the younger brother is better looking then him😐😁im just saying ITS THE HAIR!!!!
You could call them “scrolltums”
why is "Rapunzel is bald now" the funniest shit I've ever seen 🤣🤣
smh massive L to compare barbie rapunzel with brats fashion pixies instead of their fairy movie I remember the mermaid flick and the 12 dancing princesses with such fondness too- classics and it was *so* strange to see kurtis do the bratz movie, i remember being obsessed with it as a kid, talk about core memories being unlocked
Rapunzel is bald now...
HEDWIG IS A GIRL
okay but actually there are people in the circus who hang from there hair and have other people hang from their hair, so this could happen
stfu this was one of my favorite movies as a kid
How is he not bothered by his moustache hair on his upper lip 😣🥲
this was the last time we heard the extra greeting
Barbie doesnt shit bc girls dont shit smh. However, I did have her dog Tanner. You fed it food and if you lifted the tail he shit. Then you could put the shit in the food bowl, and BAM! Economical recycled organic dog food
ya hooo da ba do <3
The quote of  "Is that adorable? Yes. Were we idiots? Absolutely." Is the best way to explain something
Let’s go another Boby Flay fan
i hate you for getting “rapunzel is bald now” stuck in my head lmao
Idc that this was uploaded a year ago the "Rapunzel is bald now" part is absolutely killing me
Didn't even mention that one of the dark pixies during the rave just started howling like a wolf
That womp womp makes me cackle every time without fail
What even happened to simbaling?
the dude runs like gta characters
I remember having Bratz dolls, but noone really like them that much.  Although in their defense I'm Italian and we were all about the Winx Club over here.  While in Germany Barbie and Monster High were the popular dolls.  Bratz were a thing, but noone really liked them.  I had a few, they were mostly the gift your aunt who doesn't know what you actually like got you.    Also THEY HAD NO FEET?! Like WHY
Barbie > Bratz
Arctic Monkeys? 🫣🫣
BARBIE
Barbie?, Bratz? – No, MONSTER HIGH :)
The best joke of this video is that he played James Charles audio behind the "apology" part 💀
He should of watched barbie as princess and the pauper
Bro the weasel (I think his name is Otto) was always my favorite character as a kid… I think that explains a lot about me…
I will say it might hurt but scientifically repunzels hair could support a live person. And a corpse if she wanted. The tensile strength of hair is insane
How dare he not do the greeting.
this is one of the first videos i have genuinely laughed at
When the prince was running away in the Barbie movie I wanted him to fall in another hole so bad.
This is the funniest thing I’ve watched this year
guess Kurtis hasn't heard of the Hedwig x Hagrid fanfiction 😔😔 shame
acid wave
Manic pixie meme queen
Balles
Actually you’ll notice that when rapunzel lets her hair down she ties it around a post so any of the tension does to just the hair instead of her scalp.  Rapunzel in tangled does this with a pulley system.   Try holding your hair with one hand and then tugging with the other. You don’t feel it. Cause you only feel the pain if it pulls directly on your scalp.
Ummmm. Why does their mother look their age? 🤔
List of Bratz Best Movies: Diamondz best songs Come at me haters "BRATZ Forever Diamonndds" still plays in my head daily Rock Angels 😇 along with this line "Rock Angels ready to start!" Girls Really Rock Kidz Fairytale Pampered Petz
Barbie's first sequel with Mermaid Tale 2.  But Mandela effect said it was Fairytopia Mermaids and Fairytopia Magic of the Rainbow.  Yeah they tried to make money marketing a scam.
List of Best Barbie Movies: Nutcracker Island Princess Princess and Pauper Mariposa Come at me haters Magic of the Pegasus 12 Dancing Princesses Fashion Fairytale  Fairytopia  Princess Charm School Mermaid Tale Fairytopia Sequels
I’m disappointed that we didn’t get to see Kurtis react to Bibble 😂
The age old debate.  I like both but I prefer Bratz movies better.  However Barbie life in the dream house is top tier.
Barbie for the win
I wish you could turn the music off in movies like you can with video games
ya hooooo da ba yo
All of the characters from the Barbie rapunzel movie look like they’re from the sims 3.
*I HAVE THAT BRATZ MOVIE AS A CD-*
There's a little more ~drama~ to Barbie trying to sue Bratz! The dude behind Bratz came up with the idea while working for Mattel so they tried to sue him saying it was their intellectual property 🙄
I like your videos. They are very fun.
no the hair thing probably wouldnt even hurt that bad shes got it wrapped aeound the pillar. Theres no tension on her neck. She's gotta have hella thick hair tho
Im  obviously better 😒
But why was Simbaline with the evil pixies??
dylan walked so eboys could run..im floored  I had repressed these movies lmao
Omg the Small Soldiers story is so damn cute and stupid!! 🤣
I need these bratz again so I shall have em 😭😆
actually because it isn’t close to the nerves of her head it doesn’t hurt
I can’t believe I’m here
I almost disliked this video just because of the final rating ngl
I’m shiting rn
"Can a virgin have a podcast? Probally."  Me: Well... alpha male podcasts exist....
what do i nose
Ya hoooo da ba yo 👀
this video being a year old already makes me uncomfortable
you guys notice that the bad guys in barbie movies always look asian?..
ya hooo da ba yo!
8:51 every helluva boss fan in a five mile radius:
Ya hooo da ba yo!
Bratz pixies is an allegory for underaged drugs and no one can tell me otherwise
Now u need to do monster high vs ever after high
Kurtis wont see this but ill just say no. the hair climbing will not hurt. It hurts as much as holding a piece of hair from the center and pulling the end. You should not feel it from the way barbie has it there
This shit is way too funny 😂😂🤌🤌
Bout time no greeting
I didn't watch the video, but the answer is BARBIE
How is describing Kelly as "how stubbing your toe feels like" so god damn accurate???
The moment he said the word weasel, I knew what was coming
I keep replaying the "balls" scene over and over again. I can't stop laughing. Please send help.
I always kinda assumed repunzel tied her hair to a post so it wasn’t like pulling on her scalp and neck
okay so the barbie rapunzel movie was my shit it was like audibly stimulating, the clicking sounds of their shoes and all the other sound details. i just loved the sound.  but this movie was kookie as fuck
21:27 bro 💀
Winged unicorns are called alicorns.
319000 holes for children to fall into. Kurtis' neighbourhood is in perpetual mourning.
The matrix chase scene had my dying 😂
Actually the silent chase scene was way more intense in my opinion, absolutely gripping
"that has long ass hair" Vs "that has long ass, hair" punctuation is important kiddos
coming back to this video every month just to see kurtis twerk angrily
I wish that I was still a virgin
in this video kelly gets a lot of slander but i still don’t think she gets enough
"do i wanna gnome" PLS IM CRYINGGGG LOLOLOLOLLL
I unironically watched these movies with my sister as a kid so many times. This was a trip. I needed this.
love me some scrot scrolls
Thank you for that Artic Monkey reference that makes me happy and as always I love your video
Dude Bratz fashion pixies hit fucking hard that shit was my childhood.
0:52 Finally after all these years          I've found you.
Not gonna lie. I’m a relatively new subscriber and I thought the V R G was meant to spell out Virgo…
You gotta do the my scene doll movie
Watching VRG on the back of your videos as a Mexican hits different
*balls*
Personally I would think they are friends
Ayo he used the greendale flag for barbies asshole
ya hooo da ba yo
This guy obviously isn't a virgin if you just take a minute to listen to his jokes.  Clearly the dude has a dozen kids with his dad jokes.
Everybody who has a podcast is a virgin
Curtis: They set their friends free from the dance trance  Me: Dance Trance Revolution
Honestly I always read the "VRG" as "verga (c0ck in Spanish)" because in Latin America we abbreviate that word as vrg lol
16:25 the anger in his voice gets me every fuckin time
…man these movies where the shit :( The Barbie Rapunzel was one of my favourites. The ones with the twelve ballet dancers, the swans, princess and the pop star, thumblina, ugh all incredible… according to my 8yo memory
”Horny Weasel” sounds like a villain from a Metal Gear game.
The weasel from “Barbie as Rapunzel” always made me uncomfortable when I was a kid. Now when I’m an adult I think I know why.
I would like to say that as an irish person the gnomes irish accent was on point , it reminded me of my friends grandad even the bit of irish it spoke was accurate (I don't speak it that well  and was able to understand it )
Why did you choose one of the worst Barbie movie 😫
Why does the dragon look like Spyro?
Oh gosh! it's so nice going back to my childhood memories 😃
Lina the evil pixie dancing in slow mo was the bisexual awakening that made me realise I liked goth girls
"She has no asshole." - Kurtis Conner about Barbie
BARBIE RAPUNZEL IS THE FUCKING BEST AIGHT
Give him to meeeee ugh! 😩
Tbh the music in Bratz kinda rocks
i forgot about the arctic monkeys reference 😭😭
workin overrtimeee
I love this Barbie movie :)
I’m sorry but why does the weasel low-key sound like kurtis with an accent 😂
06:35 😭😭😭😭😭
kurtis i love you but i need you to know that hedwig was a girl 💀
The gnome referred to them as “cailinies” … I think this is Irish for “girlies” 💀
Ever seen into the woods where Rapunzel  winces whenever someone climbs up her hair.
22:27 Once my friend snorted it brand cool aid powder and got a nose bleed
Doesth thou carpet match thou drapes !!
😭😭😭 the bratz part lmaoo
I love the way you can hear his phone ding at 5:55
Kurtis: IM NOT A VIRGIN  Danny And Drew: virgins despite the wives. big virgins. big virgins.
Sorry kurtis I subscribed for the greetings if you take them away then I take away the sub.
You have ruined the word balls for me, Kurtis. Now every time someone says it, I hear Barbie saying it with the obscene amount of reverb in my head.
Bratz👑
Briana and friends pull up *gunshots
Make a Barbie and bratz movie tier list
The pixie dad is such a dilf lord
6:30 had me dying.. BALLS
ya hooo da ba yo
I went to therapy as a kid because I was super quiet and I had my barbie with me and my therapist said she looked like a hooker because she was wearing a super tight jumpsuit.  No joke! After that I went to my mom and asked what a hooker was and she described it totally embarrassed and didn't believe me at all that my therapist said that.......  I was so mad at my mom🤣
10:57 keeps me up every night
Damn this is a year old now :/
omg the number of memories that were unlocked in this video are insane thank you kurtis
8:23 NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED AND I CHOKED ON MY FOOD
This was the first video i watched and the beginning set the scene
PLSSS DO A VIDEO ON A MONSTER HIGH MOVIEEE'
kurt boy, i love you but i personally can not let you calling alicorns, flying unicorns slide😔👋🏻
NO WAY ITS BALD KURTIS
My mom says white people don’t have rhythm but I don’t know who to believe.
If u have seen tangled u know that the weasel would be all over gothel
Okay. After all this I'm still left with one question.  Why the FUCK does the fairy king have SUCH a big tiddy window my god
6:34 and that is how an ongoing meme began
I still have most the barbie movies especially Barbie Rapunzel
The fact that he still uses the "balls" clip in other videos kills me
Barbie actually tied her hair around the pole of the tower which would make all the force of whomever is climbing go there and not her actual scalp as the main point of force.
the barbie movie brings me nostalgia but omg the bratz movie is too funny 💀
13:23, in Barbie's Defense, if someone tolf you can't climb a gate if it was electrified (even though it actually isn't), you'd be hesitant to try
Of all the Barbie movies you could have picked... RIP
Ha what a vrg
whats the song during the angry twerking scene?
@ 7:51 you can see Mattel reinforce unrealistic body standards. 🤣 Is her waist literally a 15" 🤣🤣🤣
ery eally ood
Ya hooo da be yo
I grew up with the Barbie movies and won't be accepting any criticism, thank you for your understanding
Bratz is better than Barbie
please do one with monster high and bratzillas or bratz
Pulling on a braid hurts way less than pulling on loose hair by the way, for everyone who is wondering. Doesn't hurt at all tbh
The only thing that grosses me out with Bratz is how even the baby versions of the characters have layers upon layers of makeup. That's so wierd. Reminds me of those creepy beauty pagents.
13:18 just like the sims
i love you 4 this
I got an ad for rainbow high (dollys)
didnt mattel release monster high in response to bratz?
What was their intention with this scene? 21:40 Why does it keep cutting to one girl, and why is she in the "going to go insane" meme pose?
That stands for VERGA
Barbed wire, by Mattel 💗
16:10 that’s bullshit and you know it. That award should’ve went to Harvey Weinstein. It rigged.
I fucking love the Arthur theme song
Do I wanna gnome
Kurtis’s angry twerking could be classified under the horny weasel category
"this is lena, she's a trans..."
the Bratz movie is one of the movies I remember most from my childhood... plus I lvoe how Bratz actually look like real girls, like the way they dress and their hair and skin like.. plus they all have names and aren't just barbie
*Rapunzel is bald nowwwww* 😂😂😂
Never mind, was gonna explain the whole Rapulzel wrapping her hair around the post thing, but everyone did it already, so I'll just say this was a fun video, I had a good time watching it.
I watched the barbie as rapunzel movie so many times as a kid and always felt like the chase scene was awkward as hell, but i ALSO love the sound of shoes clicking on stone or tile so it never once occurred to me that the lack of music was the issue since the sound was my favorite part 😭
nooo Barbie as Rapunzel is one of the worst ones 😭😭
Wow Curtis I completely forgot about Chalk Zone you are too good at reminding me about stuff from childhood haha
Nothing makes me happier seeing a grown man talk about toys that I never played with. Not even close to joking. This and Ian Brutalmoose, man.
I didn't realise how shit the Barbie movie looked 💀 don't get me wrong. it has been quite a long time since it was released and everyone has different animation style, but...when I was a kid...it looked better and I...I don't know.
Ah hallo me Mistress, MMMMH~
Haha virgin one made me laugh. Some people😂
So THIS is where the "Baaaallssssss" and "EEEWWWW" sound effects originated!
5:52 that lady's pet looks like gotzilla from 1999 🕴🏾
in barbie in the 12 dancing princesses theres a character named lacey who looks like kelly. she scrapes her knee at one point in the movie. so my 10 year old cousin, as of a year ago, had never seen the movie, but ive seen it several times so i watched it with her, and told her that lacey died. so when we got to the point where she scrapes her knee, i said to my cousin “ok, shes dead now.” and my cousin was so dissapointed that she wasnt actually dead.💀
"You can take the barbie asshole idea, Call it even."  This video, Made me laugh the most.
nobody: no one: ok yep no one at all: barbie and kurt: *B* *A* *L* *L* *S*
my girlfriend forced me to watch Barbies dream house on Netflix and HOLY SHIT, I never imagined saying this but I actually liked it.
Barbie and monster high that’s my childhood in a nutshell
Bratz movies I watched to an older age- I was still watching them at like 11 while barbie I mainly watched as like a 6 year year old- stopped much earlier than Bratz.
chipper? I hardly know her
9:50 "Into the woods" addresses this point - not the Disney movie, but the stage play with Bernadette Peters that you can GET as a movie - by having rapunzel cry out in pain when someone climbs her hair. Don't worry,  it's hilarious.
actually, penelope couldn’t fly that high! she was too scared to do it..until she actually tried. but yeah
This is rlly nitpicky but I grew up w that movie and the small dragon Penelope and the rabbit couldn’t rescue Barbie because Penelope can’t fly. That was her whole plot conflict
This video just unlocked so many memories of the barbie as rapunzel movie for me
"do i wanna  gnome" never laughed so hard in my life
Omg never noticed: The kings and the bad witch from barbie are looking like the ones from 'swan princes'  just in 3D and bad.
Bless you!
“THY CARPET MATCH THOU DRAPES”💀💀💀💀
The last thing i expected in this movie was a very angry irish gnome
Is the weasel voiced by the same guy as Lorenzo Devilius in "Little Amadeus"?
I’ve seen this video 3 times and I laughed just as much as the first time 😂 idk a work of art to me
Kurtis you should definitely do a video on Bratz Super Babyz lol its my favorite movie out of the series and I think you could get some laughs from it.
I loved this bratz movie like obsessed 😝😝
I dress like bratz but v disappointed and engry that u chose bratz over barbie😡 barbie is th shi its my comfort movies when I feel sad lol
Why did he had to pick this Barbie movie out of all the amazing ones out there
“Can a virgin have a podcast?”  *all alpha males* -🤡🤡🤡
Alright yall its obvious who won. Monster high.
Wilhelm?? (Insert Erika phasing in)
I am going to correct you on that: Barbie had dolls of different skin colors for a long time... AND in the 80s even allowed Barbie herself to have different skin colors instead of making them separate characters. Bratz wasn't really forging new grounds when it came to representation in JUST the doll line.
Love all the small jokes he makes like about the angry Bratz twerking, Dylan twerking, the fact about the garden gnomes, rapunzel being bald, etc. it makes me laugh all the time he’s hilarious and I watch him ALL the time
the similarities between the characters in Bratz movies and current day teen tiktokers is actually disturbing
the comment about Kelly's forehead took me out, time for me to log off lmfao
‌
Barbie, Bratz, Monster High, and Ever After High was my childhood growing up and I’d like to thank them for the being the reason I care about my style 70% of the time.
okay but fr, the Bratz movie you chose, was my absolute fav thing as a kid
b..aLLS
Quentin Tarantino should have won horniest weasel, respectfully
THAT'S NOT A WEASEL
lina aka my lesbian awakening
my favorite part of this is that Kelly was killed off in 2009/2010 and is now Chelsea and he's totally shitting on Kelly, but if that's why Kelly is gone
fashion fairies was scary for me when i was 6-7 yo watching this
You gotta watch princess and the pauper it’s the best Barbie movie
7:48 Kelly in the backrooms ‼️⁉️ 🥵
for the rapunzel hurting her neck comment, the hook on the windowsill she puts her hair thru helps with like making sure her neck doesn’t hurt. (idk the science)(i also don’t care if the hook doesn’t exist in this movie)
He should do more of these
iI'm gonna need a reaction video for the My Scene dolls movies too. Preferably the classic, Jammin' in Jamaica created by the guy who did Celebrity Deathmatch.
"Long asshair"
do a video on chalk zone
I know this video is a year old but omg I’m so glad you were in my recommended :,) I was literally crying/laughing at every joke you made. New sub!
Kelly has a gotdamned fivehead
Is wilhelm the king of Germany if so I dont support barbies kingdom
Gothel is a fake goth
u chose the wrong barbie movie 💔
Do thy carpets match thy drapes?  Edit: it has been a month since I first saw this, and forgot I made this comment, and when I heard the phrase while rewatching it, I got the urge to comment the quote, only to find that past me already did it. Lmao
DUDE You need to review Monster High. Monster high kicked these BOTH out of the park with jot only topics about racial segregation, but mob mentality, police brutality, sexism, and even disabilities.  Also, they had the better movies, the best vocab, a freaky cool fit.
I don’t think that Gotto put the spell on the castle in the first place because she didn’t think that were publish with whatever think to leave or look for places that she could escape
The echo after she said "balls" sent me
do i wanna gnome was so funny
the angry twerking has me dying laughing
Mattel me that huh!
I loved the Rapunzel movie as a kid but wow the CGI sucks😭
Dude. This is my favorite video. Me and my sister loved it. Now anytime we watch a show we always look out for a character that resembles the horny weasel.
Dylan is the best Bratz character ever
i never get more than 5 minutes into this video every time I click on it bc barbie and bratz movies are my favorite things in the world since childhood and I don't want him changing my mind on that or ruining the movies for me lmao
I did not watch Bratz that much, but I did like the Bratz games that I played on the internet when I was little
Bless you
As a kid, I watched this movie a lot for reasons I didn't understand until now.   The girl pixies were very pretty and I had no idea I was gay yet, so there's that.   But the main reason was because the whole movie I felt like I was being hypnotized and I felt high.
He is Entertaining me idk why but ima let it happen👏🏼👏🏼
I love Bratz!
I agree, Kelly's forehead was a little too huge I must say😭
i laughed so hard at the twerking girl
Wilhelm?? Is he gay and knows a Simon by any chance???
i was wondering why are you doing barbie and bratz vs, because when i was at time when we played with dolls (i was born in 2002) it was barbie all the way, no question! We did not got the ´bratz hype’ and now i know why: i am from middle of europe, everyone literally looks like barbie, i ain’t seen black person or actually any ethnic person irl till i was like 15 soo 😁 it all make sense now, but believe me was i confused with the way bratz look:D
Bratz were for the bad bs
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭☹️☹️☹️☹️exta greeting 😞
20:40 LSD glasses
How many times have you watched this video.   Me: yes.
I always played with barbie’s but watched brats movies……so…
I can’t 😂 21:53
i love how the baby bratz girls are wearing eyeliner and mascara, pop off
Do this again! Do it again! Lmfaoooo
Im gonna say it: the lack of music during the gothel chase scene is to me what makes it so good! i remember seeing it as a kid and being on the edge of my seat and super nervous for the prince, idk it adds to the suspense i feel
18:59 cuts to the Logan Paul apology video
I watched these movies so much growing up, your commentary is hilarious! Thank you:)
Im sure most of us had the same expression as him during 10:58
18:19 Is this supposed to be a german accent? Because it sounds lowkey like they tried to do that. But now I only understand gibberish. And naturally as a german, I hate this.
This Barbie movie looks like a 2000 Valve videogame.
Anyone wanna mention how Stephan looks like a goddamn sims 2 character
Not enough people are talking about 'Do I wanna gnome?'
i watched this high and laughed so much lmaoo
i was like “THERE IS A BRATZ MOVIE?!” and then “omg i think i watched it before….” wtf
rapunzel always wraps her hair behind something to create tension before she throws it usually and so the head feels nothing. :D
Oh I see
BRATZ FOR THE WIN
Actually, if you know a little bit about Scottish and Irish fairy folklore, some "gnomes" can be murderous. For all we know, that little guy's red hat was soaked in someone's blood. 👀  "The redcap is a type of malevolent, murderous goblin found in Border folklore. He is said to inhabit ruined castles along the Anglo-Scottish border, especially those that were the scenes of tyranny or wicked deeds and is known for soaking his cap in the blood of his victims. He is also known as Redcomb and Bloody Cap."  I kinda get what the Bratz movie was trying to do with their own spin on pixie and fae lore. If only they executed it better.
chipper?? I hardly know her
The “never release a prisoner with a lying heart” still scares me to this day
THEY’RE MAKING A LIVE ACTION BARBIE MOVIE
Thumbs up and an additional comment to beat the algorithm. Thanks for the video! 👍🔥👍
Personally I'm more of a Monster High gal myself
TJATS WHAT THOSES LETTER MENT…
ya hooo da ba yo
I laughet until i cried, i swear. I wish i could go see ur standupshows but youre so very far away
clearly kurtis never watch gravity falls.
i always watch this video religiously at least three times a month
I can't remember what brats movie it was but we always made fun of the dad for consistently saying, "oh heavens to Betsy," over and over again 🤣
“Kelly falls into a hole, and unfortunately they save her life” D@mn kurtis you REALLY hate her
that gnome was technically incorrect in calling the girls cailinis, the plural of girls in Irish is just cailini
hedwig is a girl
What is this, They Live?
2:35 ShitTea 28 Day Detox
Like how some versions of Jesus show him with the nails through the hands (unrealistic) and some show with nails through the wrists (realistic), so too do some versions of rapunzel show her scalp supporting the weight of the prince, and some show her tying her hair around a hook or something so that will support his weight instead of her follicles.
this Bratz movie was also a book! And genuinely a good one by my childhood standards
I didn’t have Bratz as a kid because my mom basically said, “I don’t want you to be a brat” 😂
This just in; Kurtis Conner *fucks*
why the hell is kurtis spelt with a k? whatever, i dont care because u hot
Wait the king was named Wilhelm....
You should try Monster High
oh, actually VRG in spanish could sound like vergà, which means ... di*k :P
Watch barbie fairytopia
I can’t help but think ‘banished’ was just when she got kicked from the pixie discord server.
Wow that chase between the Bratz and Jackscepticeye was pretty freaky.
I feel like Kurtis would LOVE Into the Woods (the broadway version)
absolute L you didn't compare barbie fairytopia to this bratz movie
10:02 I never laughed so hard that I got cottonmouth
ain't that a shrek 3 reference? 10:09
Monster high and bratz were always my favorite and still are, I never got around liking Barbie 😋🤞🏽
6:35 - You're welcome
dude's got a moustache definitely not a virgin
I watched this vid and now I’m getting ads for terrifying gender-stereotypical dolls. I guess what I’m saying is, screw you Kurtis.     Just kidding. The doll ads are way better than all the frikkin’ ads for scammy ‘financial freedom’ programmes.
You gotta watch Barbie Island Princess next. The music is ✨
You should react to the Bratz Sleepover movie, that movie traumatized younger me
Little background info, one fairy lore thing is that if you step inside a fairy circle (circle made out of mushrooms or stones or something) or if you're in the forest and you hear music and sing/dance along, they'll trap you and make you dance/sing forever or until you die from exhaustion, so it might have been a reference to that!!!!
..he’s a virgin
Thanks for telling us you’ve had sex atleast one time Kurtis👍🏼
THE JAMES CHARLES IMPRESSION WAS SPOT ON 💀💀
barbie as rapunzel  is ShIT
Okay, I've watched this video like five times already but I still don't know what the plot was for the Bratz movie was. Like, stuff just happens and it's kinda forgettable too. So I think I would choose the Barbie movie as the winner cause at least I know what the fuck happened.
You have tears in your eyes every time you see the creepy children 😂
12:12 I remember being scared shitless of this scene. I remember another scene where the guy and barbie try to find each other and their footsteps are so fkn loud and our TV's volume was high up and I remember being very, very scared of that scene and in turn the whole movie. I have no idea why.
the little gnome guy lmao "YAHOOHOOABADO"
PLEASE react to the bratz kids sleepover adventures movie, it was terrifying😭
This video is peak Kurtis
i love how the irish gnomes accent is the same as mine 😭
give him to me..Ah~
Lmao my mom was one of those parents who hated bratz. She literally told me that I couldn’t have a bratz doll because they were whores. I think I was 8.
The  Rapunzel Barbie movie was my favorite back then 😋 glad you picked that one
Totally should have watched Bratz Kidz Fairytales
I loved the movie Small Soldiers!
I was never allowed to have any Bratz stuff as a kid but we memorized all the Barbie movies practically. I love those things. I really wish I had been allowed to have Bratz, I thought they were pretty fuckin badass
I loved both Barbie and Bratz growing up.  I had both Barbie movies and the Bratz movie.  Barbie was just as hurtful as Bratz in terms of expected beauty. Barbie stayed the same for many years while Bratz was diverse in skin colors and styles.
22:43 i wanna say no but i feel in curiosity id be tryna do that…for science
HOW FUCKING DARE YOU NOT GIVE ME AN EXTRA GREETING KURTI- also youre a virgin, even danny and drew are. just accept it.
The woodchipper joke gave me an asthma attack
‘Kelly looks like what stubbing your toe feels like’ is gonna be my next tattoo
This is my comfort video
6:34
Afaik rapunzel wraps her hair around some sort of hook or pole coming out of the wall so it doesnt hurt
It's funny that the reason Kelly looks so terrifying is because she literally has Barbie's same face mold/features just squished down lol. They didn't even reduce the size of her head.
9:05 i laughed too hard at that, literally choking on air 🤣
Barbie had the best movies, bratz had the best dolls
The Last extra greeting 😔🤘
Weirdly enough, I was allowed to have Bratz dolls but not Barbies because of the body proportions thing. My mom deemed Bratz unrealistic enough that it wouldn't affect my body image.  But apparently Barbie was realistic enough to mess with it??? I dunno man
CURTISSSSSS . u. Should do Barbie and the secret door for the tie breaker , it was my childhood , and Kelly isn’t in it .
I worked at Vivendi when we published Barbie Horse Adventures.  This world is fucking bullshit, man.  Run.
hedwig is a girl
I actually cried from laughing so hard watching this video
The plot twist where the climax came from the balls and not the disturbingly aroused weasel was my favorite part.
Gunna be honest, loved this Barbie movie when I was younger. Great soundtrack (though you didn't really mention it, other than the lack of one during the odd scene that admittedly needed it). Still find it way more appealing than anything Bratz I'm afraid. I feel like many of your Repunzel questions would've been answered if you'd paid attention to the movie 😂 I will defend this movie to the death and I'm not even ashamed
Hey, how dare you not mention the dress transformation scene 😲
Thing I've noticed about most Repunzel iterations, she always wraps her hair around something before letting anyone climb it. Same with this one. It's never straight from the scalp
Why do you know that Barbie doesn't have an asshole ey???/ explain that
22:00 This whole thing is making me cry laughing
Actually if someone was to climb up someone's hair it would hurt less than you may think as long as they are using all the hair at the same time plus in the original tangled movie she uses a lever which stops it from being painful
I will watch infinite parts of this series as long as you keep hating on kelly 😂
7:57 😭😭 I cant
When I take a glance at the comments before playing the video and I think "wtf is this video about", I know I'm in for a treat. <3
9/10, 8/10, 3/10 barbie movie
hi kurtis very nice 😍
I watched this movie when I was like 6 or 7 idk but I would kill to watch these movies for some reason
dylan is peak fiction
Omg Penelope (the dragon) looks like Spyro lmao.
I remember a whole different Barbie movie, it’s been 10-11 years 😂😂😂
11:50 I laughed so hard.
Please revised Strawberry Shortcake movies
weasel: PRRRrr
I still want a loop of Dylan twerking with the music playing bass boosted.
this video is my favourite thing ever. Kelly is a public menace
Wait did she marry her brother………is Stephen her brother 🧍
"And Kelly wasn't in it" The most ironic part is that Chantal Strand, the voice actress who plays Kelly in the Barbie movies, including Barbie Rapunzel, is literally the voice of Breanna in this Bratz movie.
Those letters mean "verga".    It means dick. But a fat one and a gross one. Yeah, we have this word in Spanish porque somos la verga 😎
you need to watch the movie with bibble in it
why does stephen  look more like a bratz boy then a barbie boy
to be fair Penelope was scared/didnt know how to fly lmao
I took my headphones out to talk to someone and upon putting them back in heard the headwig passage. so many emotions
The weasel’s “noises” are going to forever haunt my nightmares
Verga actually
I remember when I was little I watched bratz kidz sleepover adventure and that movie gave me nightmares- it really had me believing that me and my friends were going to turn into monsters and run around town eating people
"Scrotum scrolls", Dude it's scrolltum.
I watched that bratz movie years  and years ago and never knew what it was to the point I convinced myself it was a weird dream. How strange.
As someone from the uk and grew up when bratz first came out, it’s 100% more popular or was more popular than barbie. It was everywhere but the barbie movies did slap tbh
Good thing Barbie and Kelly got their four head Reduction after that movie.
vrg = verga uwu
1:27 I love you for referencing my favorite video on YouTube
bless you
هههههههه؟؟؟
what always bothered me about barbie movies is that they always look like the previous sims game graphics and is the product of a billion dollar company like come on
15:00
my dad says you look like the guy from napolean dynamite. you also look 80s german, according to him
the children in barbie movies have always made me uncomfortable ngl
How is Bratz animation worse
why is no one talking about the angry twerking, I literally spit out my food laughing so hard LMAOOO
Kurtis your critical thinking wasn't on point today. Rapunzel let's her hair down but she doesn't let it hang fully. She let's some of her hair stay behind her as she holds the rest in front of her and It is down to the bottom of the tower. she's holding it with her hands, Kurtis. But we aren't on Danny's subreddit so I guess critical thinking isn't necessary. have a good day dear mayor.
you think you can just use the e pluribus anus flag and we won't notice because you turned it pink
"kurtis just move on, you don't have to make a joke about it" if only he knew
Bratz babies ngl was a bit cringe but lol dolls baby version really is cause I had seen one in fishnets and lipstick?? Why I have no clue
ya hooo da ba yo
I love you your so aming
WOOD CHIPPER
8:57
Bratz were the original Lol surprise but now Bratz are collectors items. I liked the cars and the boy version of the dolls.
The Barbie movie looks like it was rendered with an N64
i wonder who got 500 bucks
The brats girls hair in this is absolutely mesmerizing I think it made me gay
6:33 Just a friendly reminder
Audible reaction at 24:50: “Those are alicorns you fucker! *turns to my dog* They’re alicorns!”
16:57 holy crap this is a banger
7:41 i agree
Kurtis got a dumpy
ya hooo da ba yo
2:45 he is laughing about that.. but we all know how many toys there are that can shit. As a child I always wanted this one barbie that came with a shitting dog.
the way the weasel moans😭😭
kurtis you should watch bratz kidz sleepover (idk if thats the exact name) but it gave me nightmares when i was little
Bratz Fashion Pixies is superior. Best Bratz movie.
The small gnome is gonna stab u with his hat?? Is that what it's called
Bratz genie is honestly a classic!
I’m rewatching this before I watch the rematch!
With kurtiss dancing he looks like he belongs in footloose
Curtis Konnee needs to stop
Okay Kurtis but you are missing one thing about the Barbie Rapunzel movie. There were games! Built into the movie like on the Home Screen for the movie there was a tab that you could play a game on and it was kinda fun tbh
6:34
ok but real talk the barbie detective games are actually so good
Are you gonna restock those Kowboy hoodies??
I actually really love the barbie movie I watched it a lot when I was younger!! but seriously what is going on with that weasel
i have to recommend Barbie & The Rockers - they go to space and then back in time and its fucking weird but also... very good somehow.
The Barbie movies always made me feel like I was in a fever dream or on drugs, that’s how I remember me watching  them lol
6:24 … after this I got that stoopid dulolinho ad where the guy says  ‘ duo lingo knows learning a new language is … hard !! ‘    … not funny
NOT ME TAKING THIS VIDEO SERIOUSLY AND DEFEND BRATZ IN MY HEAD 💀
ya hooo da ba yo
Funny how Mattel sues Bratz. I mean what is the number 1 rule in capitalism? *competition*
The scene with no background music is hilarious
That Chalk Zone reference unlocked memories I didn't know existed
I love Barbie movies but bratz fashion pixiez FUCKS HARD
ngl seeing Kurtis pretending to be a gnome aggressively pissing on blazing flames is honestly one of the funniest things Ive ever seen
If Kurtis hates Kelly now, wait until he watches Barbie in Swan Lake
“Mattel Me That” bruh 😂😂😂
Sorry but hedwigs pronouns are she/her lol
Hedwig is a girl
This was the best thing for my heart
Kurtis trying to prove to me that he's not a virgin is golden
All of the characters in the Barbie movie look like Sims 2 characters.
I want a Kurtis Conner "balls" compilation so bad. Every appearance of the Barbie "balls" soundbite since the original video.
In my country vrg is short for verga which basically means cock
That stands for “verga” actually
4:12 assing me
yo Barbie as Rapuzel was my SHIT as a kid. probably watched that movie tons of times lol
Yes! I remember chalk zone!! wtf?!!?!! It was sitting in the back of my brain until you mentioned it. 😂😂😂
L+monster high better
3:40 the dumbest joke I've ever laughed at XD so dumb it was great
"Sigourney Weaver is a Horny Weasel."  - Kurtis Conner, 2021
Okay but the bad bratz doll is definitely the coolezt
a man in his twenties talking about barbies                yay
I had no idea this was where the "balls" and "ewwww" sound effects came from but can I just say it make it so much better that it came from a video he made and not a random soundboard
The Irish gnome is terrifying
#SigourneyWeaverisahornyweasel
Imagine if barbie movie have high budget like disney movie
If you hold ur hair the right way (like, up?? It’s hard to explain) you won’t feel anything! Jsut have to be strong enough to hold it, (or have it long enough to tie it to somthing so you don’t feel it)
I got the google pixel add right after she said “she’s a pixie” and I legitimately thought it was part of the movie for a sec
He should do monster high vs ever after high
your new bratz v barbie video brought me here...i will return to watch that one now...thanks  EDIT: oh and bless you
needed myself a recap before watching the sequel
the angry twerking wasnt supposed to be as funny as it was
I'm shocked he didn't mention that barbie's waist is so small that Ken's hands literally touch finger to finger @ 7:51 lol
Dylan was the blueprint for Lil huddy
KURTIS, please, watch the halloween Bratz movie, it has lots of funny parts in it and stuff like that. I think you might like it.
xD

21:57 kurtis twerking angrily 23:36 kurtis dancing again
Barbie princess charm school the best Barbie movie periodt!!!
ya hooo da ba yo
I've played with Barbies and Bratz when I was little and I have to admit I like the Bratz's style more but the Barbie movies are still imprinted on my mind—like the Barbie of Swan Lake and that girl and her daddy, the lowkey attraction I had for Delancy in Barbie and the Charm School, and especially that "I'm just like you" "You're just like me" moment 💀
I need 500 more of these videos
HELP I REMEMBER WATCHING THE RAPUNZEL MOVIE I LOVED IT BACK THEN😭
Listening to this with headphones on and my husband noticed me laughing... What resulted was 15 minutes of us trying to twerk with angry faces but laughing so hard we cried. Thanks Kurtis.
Kurtis : *Bratz* Subtitles : *bratz/rats/brats*
Of all the choices to make in the Bratz movie, I really wanna know why the gnome had a Jamaican accent
phone bad book good
God this movie in Portuguese - Brazil is sooooooo much funnier. The horny pet is 50 times hornier and crepprier
I'm surprised the kings didn't spawn double crossbows during the Man Argument
Back here to remind myself of the glorious origin of the Balls meme
I’ll be sitting by the phone Mattel  Mattel: blocks number
Loool not you calling the main Bratz girls "Brianna's friends"
25:20 umm wood chipper? I hardly know her
I literally can not this video is funny every time
hedwing is a girl
2:52 lol I love how it shows the greendale logo from community
We do Not talk about the weasel
ya hooo da ba yo
Alexa play ✨RAPUNZEL IS BALD NOW ✨
Give me my extra greeting!
Good
masochist barbue 😊😊😊
real ones know monster high dolls were the true superiors
I love how all of barbie movies have the same plot
You should have watched the barby fairy princess movie it’s way better then both films
The origin of “balls”
As someone who grew up on that specific barbie movie.. the bratz movie was better
@6:50 is this where the legendary "Balls" sound comes from?
Kurtis’ phobia of barbie children will never get old to me😂
🔺️〽️🔥‼ 🐶〽️🔺️⁉️
Not mentioning that his girlfriend is absolutely stunning too! 😭
In the show the 10th kingdom. Which is sorta modern day girl falling into a fairy tale.   There is a scene where she is punished with long hair and then gets trapped in a tower. Her friend can't get in so he asks her to throw her hair down. But the entire time he is climbing up she is screaming that it hurts
You watched the wrong movies
The Balls sound got me every time. EVERY. SINGLE.TIME.
18:20 Fun Fact: He’s calling them “nosy cailíní” which is just the Irish word for “girls”.
1:28 my adhd during my therapy appointments
Could you watch Barbie as the Island princess Kurtis. Its the perfect movie for you.
bro you didnt watch the best barbie movie which is the 12 dancing princesses. 12 dancing princesses barbie movie supremecy
But… but… Hedwig is a girl ..
HILARIOUS
I think watching the video has brought back forgotten memories from when I was 5 years old.
I’m a Bratz girl for life!!!! 💋💋💋
As a poc I grew up being absolutely obsessed over Yasmin from Bratz it was the first time I saw a doll with tanned skin like mine and I don’t think, until now just how much that meant to me when I was a young girl. Especially from a culture where you don’t see in media at allllll I’ll always have such a soft spot in my heart from Bratz.
Now this is art
This is my favorite video to come back to always
barbies are just the most basic stereotype for women, "blond, skinny and likes pink" therefore team bratz
I just thought of the fact that it literally was someone’s job to paint panties on Bratz dolls… that is so weird to me.
Leana casts Otto's Irresistible Dance at a 9th level.
Lmao my mom was one of those white ladies that wouldn't let us play with Bratz, even though they were so much cooler. Even as a trans egg kid that didn't like "girl stuff", I wanted them sooo bad.
ofc.  boob nails and balls iconic
Pip squeaks playing with little plastic people
Woah
Ok but why is the cast of Bratz literally the cast of Euphoria
This is Princess and the Pauper erasure. Preminger alone makes that movie a 20/10.  Also does anyone else remember the Barbie princess PC games? The Rapunzel one was so good.
He should watch every Barbie movie and rate them
gotta love bratz + barbie but in my opinion bratz= better dolls and barbie= better movies
Please do more of this! I've watched this with  my friends like 4 times now and show it to everyone that doesn't know you.
The angry twerking bit is so funny 🤣😂😂😂
Holy shit dude, that was a huge nostalgia trip, my little sister used to watch that Repunzel movie all the time, I liked Penelope, though the adolescent version of me would never admit to ever even watching it lol   chock it up to being a big Spyro fan I guess
“That is weasel cum” sends me every time
I would love another one of these
Let’s talk about why Kurtis didn’t cover the literal greatest Barbie movie in existence ✨The Twelve Dancing Princesses✨
18:44 Kurtis: “ do I wanna gnome? ”  Me: “ *yeah-ah-aah…* “
The weasel is the Barbie version of a sixth grade (grade six) boy
21:38
Oh, gnomes gnaw your toes off. I legitimately used to have constant nightmares about it as a kid. Running and hiding and gnomes catching up to me just to bite off my toes. Not eat them! Just bite them off.
This is my comfort video
I knew of barbie way sooner than bratz because my mom was one of those people who thought bratz were too inappropriate. Its always gonna be the barbie movies for the win for me but I still love the bratz movies and I had one of the nintendo ds games too
ViRGin
fun fact, faeries in irish folklore have this thing where any time they hear music they have to dance like they cant control it so tehy constantly need new shoes and thats why leprechauns made so much money and had pots of gold
Genuinely upset there was so much horny weasel talk, but no references to Encino Man :'(
You should review more Bratz or Barbie movies. There’s some pretty good ones that have weird moments worthy of commentary!
Should’ve chose bratz forever diamondz or rock Angelz those slap
brats fashion pixies was my favorite movie as a child. it feels like a fever dream now.
Kurtis’ reaction to the weasel moaning is so funny
Kinda like Disney Vs Dreamworks. Dreamworks is the cool one
Allow me mistress
That's literally the funniest thing i've ever seen in my entire life
You kinda sound like Ryland Adams 🫢
I always ripped of the brats dolls heads off and used them as if there a fish and there hair was the tail
Barbie Rapunzel was my fav as a kid omggg 😭
Can't believe you left Penelope's arc as a flightless dragon out for the sake of comedy Kurtis
NOTIFICATIONS ARE OOOOONNNNNNN! Lmk if u need my address so you can send my trophy on off THAAAAAAAANNNNKS 🖤
Horny weasel you cracking me tf off I’m fkn subcribin you talk me into it bc of your weasel sir
Bratz all de way baby , barbie is cancelled 🥴    🤔Side note: Omfg barbie in rapunzel was FAVORITE 🍿 MOVIE on VHS 📼 when I was very little babe I watched it so dayum much. But nonetheless I will say I’ll dispose of barbie instantly…..
3:22
This is so funny 😆
i loved thos barbies movies i loved like loved the one in this video so so much!
No bc the way he actually picked my fav bratz movie and barbie movie to review
I LOVE THAT GNOME HES SO IRISH
I say make this a series🥳 im obsessed w all the old barbie and bratz movies literally my childhood
What snack did y’all get? I got some cheese sticks 👌
SIR YOU MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY “SCROLLTUMS”
The "balls" meme killed me XD ... You should review more barbie movies ,you are hilarious
The Bratz movie where they have a slumber party and tell scary stories scared the fucking shit out of me. Why are Bratz movies so fucking terrifying??
Kurtis is the combination of the most American man and the most Canadian man
But who remembers the tinker bell movies? That shit made me FREAK out when i was younger
Im goonna ison ya
Here for the Kelly slander
Kurtis I hate to break it to you but you might be a virgin
10:15 rapunsel is Bald now
ugh mondays am i right :p
i love chalk zone 😭
holy shit I thought both of these movies were just dreams from my childhood until I watched this video 😭😭
Oh my god the echo do when she said *B A L L S* made me laugh so much 6:33
petition to cancel kurtis for misgendering headwig /j
Me who grew up with monster high.               Now do monster high-
Kurtis you are so fucking gorgeous.
I laughed so hard i want more of this. Barbie movies' animation in so, so, so bad. They don't even try to hide that it's a cash grab. Such bad quality movies are disrespectful to children...
But is a spell the villain make so why is she so angry? She should be able to dissolve it i think.
Can you talk about monster high?
This is my all time favorite Kurtis video, he needs to do a sequel, maybe he can include other doll brands too like Monster High
i kinda like all the scemo characters in the bratz movie lmao
all the nerves in rapunzel's scalp are completely dead after years of brushing out *yards* of tangles
okay but can I just say he picks THE BEST Bratz movie
bratz wins just by their theme song, is soooo good, barbie could never
The way Bratz songs popped off Barbie's little classical numbers just didn't hit the same. The club song was literal trance music and the gnomes are nightmare fuel.
This is my confort video
i thought vrg meant verga
Stop playing the goddamned weasel noise its turning me on!
the clothings in bratz is fuckin BOMB
Binging ur videos on 🍄 and it’s the funniest thing I’ve ever watched
bro these comments about different barbie movies are finally giving me the confirmation i needed that those weren’t all just fever dreams
Kurtis roasted Barbies so much that this video became just a straight up barbiecue 🙈🙈
That matrix chase with no music had me wheezing
I loved the Barbie nutcracker movie as a kid lol.
Do
Lol. My mother wouldn’t even let me get a lalaloopsy doll until I was 8. If I asked for a Bratz … Lawd JeSuS.
i never understood how my mom let me play with barbies and polly pockets but not bratz. i thought bratz had better clothes 😠 but she didn’t want me to feel compelled to get lip fillers and start flirting with boys. i ended up sewing all the clothes for my dolls and now i’m in costume design 😭
now monster high x
You can ABSOLUTELY tell when an owl is horny. They make monkey like jungle noises at each other.  Source: I live in the forest, and my first year in this house was TERRIFYING.
10:10  "Rapunzel is balled now" 🤣
This episode made me laugh so fuckin hard the woman in the suite above mine just called me to ask if I was OK ve
I used to make sure I got every Barbie movie when I was little. I think the first one was Barbie and the Nutcracker and I think I got all of them up to Barbie Fairytopia: Mermaidia. I even remember having the Barbie Rapunzel doll because you could make her hair (braid) longer or shorter and it was pretty cool. I do remember rewatching the Swan Lake one in the past year or so because I found the DVD and I forgot how not great that animation is😂
“Balls.” ―Barbie
still so mad you didnt watch the one where the bratz work to fund a trip bc that movie made me who i am today
Bratz>>>>
She clearly has her hair wrapped around the pillar, then holding it with slack would  make it not hurt. . Tangled coverd this as well; she has a leverage system that makes it possible!!
say what you will about this film and i will laugh but this film was the absolute shit growing up
should’ve watched barbie mermaidia smh
versus 2.0 — watch princess and pauper and another bratz movie
Everyone saying Barbie's Rapunzel was a bad choice as it wasn't the best, but not a soul has mentioned that Kurtis overlooked ROCK ANGELZ for fashion pixies.. such a disgrace
Monster High was better
Unsubbed for no extra greeting. It’s the whole reason!  Jk, love you 🥰🙏 i will remain subbed until i die 🥳
I ONLY EVER GET CHARMEN ALTRA SOFT TOILET PAPER ADDS😭
I was gifted Barbie as Rapunzel when I was a kid and it's pretty good for a kids movie. Penelope is also baby and her not being able to fly up really high the first time is a major point in the movie later
barbie looks like tall girl, from the movie. tall girl.
Ya hooo da ba yoo
I beg all of you to go to 11:06 right now (and maybe pause)! I can't be the only traumatized one out here...
15:57
21:11 One of the best jokes ever made-
Kurtis: Can owls get horny? Helluva Boss Fans: Yes, yes they can
wasn't there a horny weasel in the second live action garfield movie? Maybe that is actually a secret category
Rip extra greeting 🙏 😔
Weasles what....🙍‍♀️
✨𝓫𝓪𝓵𝓵𝓼✨ echoing in the background is my favourite thing ever
If the spell doesn’t apply to you specifically you’re legally allowed to leave
Me, the monster high obsessed kid
Am I the only one that would love to see Kurtis and Dylan do a video together 😂😂💀
kurtis: grab a snack or water me whos eating tacos and drinking water while watching this: i understood the assignment
my extra greeting! how dare you kurtis.
do monster high next
Barbie life in the dreamhouse is the best 😄
Please more Bratz Kurtis do it do it now
7:32 had me cackling
OMG PLEASE…YOU CHOSE THE CORRECT BARBIE MOVIE 💀💀💀💀✨
21:45-21:50 Girl Aggressively twerking
I have a barbie movie suggestion: Barbie ‘dolphin magic’ I used to absolutely ADORE it as a kid- and I feel like it’s better then…   Let’s just say the amount of better it is is the size of Kelly’s forehead.
More like very really gay
That Bratz movie has been a fever dream since I was small
still have the $90 blockbuster VHS copy of Barbie rapunzel from 2006 that was never returned lol imo Barbie swan lake was better tho
11:53 WHY IN EVERY VIDEO PLS
Not my stupid ass choking and repeating "scrotum scrolls" 😭😂
We’re your Daughters, Kurtis.
19:59 he’s stating the similarities between the movies but actually he’s describing most the movies I watched as a child. Like 80-85%
SO MUCH of fashion today is based off the clothes our toys wore!! Look up the Jeffery Campbell Band Knee High Boot. It’s a fucking Bratz shoe! And it costs $335! At that price it better come with the detachable foot inside 🦶
Do owls get horny? *Stolas enters the chat*
i recommend watching bratz kids sleepover adventure i literally own it on dvd and does that mean its good...no lol
OH MY GOD! Gothel is voiced by Angelica Houston!!
Headwig is a girl
Now waiting for the sequel barbie vs Bratz vs monsterhigh
I'm sorry, I grew up with Barbie so maybe I'm kinda bias... but I'm having trouble understanding how anyone could even begin to comprehend what happened in the Bratz movie. I was so lost the whole time haha
I just have too many memories with bratz, no movie can beat nostalgia
5:45 Evil Witch Lady: "YOU CAN'T GO OUTSIDE!"  Also her: ".....Did you weed the garden..?"
never thought i would see an arthur read x bratz crossover
_A strange fact about me is how I loved Barbie as a child and now I'm into Bratz as a young adult_
13:17  HELP
Pov: Kelly is your big toe
kurtis chose the shittiest movie
My favorite was diva starz...
Bratz was and is cooler no matter what. I'll never forget the bratz rock angels dolls. Their music and outfits were cooler.
Ahi dice verga (vrg)
10:15 MatPat begs to differ
"so no headwig? D:< "
This is the first video of yours that I ever watched and I love that the first thing that I learned about you was that you weren't a virgin.
the way i grew up with barbie cause my mum didn’t let me play with bratz… she said their clothes were inappropriate
smash     virgin
6:34 balls
He's trying so hard to convince me he's not a virgin that I now think he is a virgin.
barbie
the fact that i know this video word by word is not even surprising since this is one of kurtis’ funniest videos
he needs to watch the barbie nutcracker film
Bro chose the worst films of both series to watch
I love him
that specific bratz movie is my comfort movie idc what ANY of y’all say about it
Ya hooo da ba yo
I hate how much bald Kurtis looks like Reginald Hargreaves (from Umbrella Academy)
and right off the bat im gonna say kelly is a goddamn nightmare to look at  -kurtis
6:33 for the clip you're looking for
I am crying laughing 🥲😂
5:53 show this to ur parents
i always liked Bratz more growing up i loved their clothing and how they had more styles and more types of actual dolls i appreciate that
My cat was able to rip all my Barbie's heads off and leave them in a pile under my mom's bed. However, she was never able to pop off one of those giant Bratz heads. I give Bratz a 10/10 for durability.
Bro what do you mean that movie gave me childhood phobia of action figures Chuckie already had me scared of dolls
"folks, now it's time for the big climax! ....and it's not from the weasel, don't worry" got me cackling
I ACTUALLY USED TO BE SCARED OF THAT SCENE OF THE GARDEN GNOMES😭😭😭
how the fuck did that crow steal dylan’s backpack when it was _on his fucking back_
he shouldve watched the on when they have the sleepover and theres like clowns
doth thou carpets match thy drapes??
Hardcore Barbie fan here (judge me all you want but I love them)— Barbie rapunzel is definitely not one of the best Barbie movies out there. Princess and the pauper, diamond castle, dancing princesses, and three musketeers are def among some of the best ones!
He should totally react to Barbie The Princess and The Pauper bc it’s absolutely bonkers and also a musical
20:00
Me who grew up in a christian household where we weren't allowed to watch bratz- barbie was my entire life lmao
6:35
6:35
i ate a bowl of chips while watching this video and every time the weasel moaned i dropped my chip. every. time.
Well I feel like her head wouldn’t rlly hurt bc whenever I grab my hair near my scalp with one hand and then drag on the ends of it with the other, my scalp doesn’t hurt whatsoever. Idrk why but that’s my experience
I found "THAT ONE TIME" heh...I think
Fun fact, The irish gnome at 18:18 says nosey cailíní meaning girls in irish
Wait how is the evil mother in rapunzel trapped if she was the one that put the spell to begin with? Wouldn't she be able to remove it? 💀
I don’t feel like this was conclusive. *M o r e*
I often audibly gasp due to the things you say.
2:58 unfortunately that's exactly what happened it just took almost 20 years 🥲
I'm only realising now that the scene of the evil pixies dancing at that party is oddly similar to that opening scene in Blade where the vampires are having a rave
The Rapunzel is bald now skits fucking killed me LMAOOOO
Imagine you are having a bad day so you kick a little garden gnome and then the gnome pisses your skin off your bones like a pressure washer while yelling gibberish in a scottish voice. For whoever uses this idea for a horror movie, I demand 80% of all profits.
i had bratz dolls. they didn’t have feet. idk why.
Please watch Barbie Fairytopia, the mermaid one is my favourite!
I need a Barbie vs Bratz pt 2 pls!
9:47 to be fair she does wrap it around something so its not directly putting the pressure on her head😉
9:39 wait- OHHH she wrapped it around the pillar to prevent the full weight of the guy just like- ripping out her hair..
He forgot monster high 😔
I really was not expecting Irish rep in a bratz movie yet here we are. Hate to say the accent wasn't as terrible as most attempts in media are??!?
unsubscribing cus barbie didn't win
how dare you disrespect MISS hedwig like that 😭
this is my go-to comfort video
Barbie is always winning!😍😍💖💖💖💖💋💋💋💋
1:38  what the heck is this it's so cursed it's one of the most cursed things ever I hate it
Kurtis u don't understand the pixies at the rave reacted like that because they were evil and there was good pixie dust falling on them so it hurt them.
I will defend barbie movies for the rest of my life
The best part of this video is kurtis's dancing like👏👏👏💰💰💰
26:31
i know this is 9 months old and kurtis will probably never see this but i desperately want him to watch barbie princess and the pauper purely so he hears the line “you simpering simpleton” from preminger
So why does Gothel want Barbie to weed the garden? Isn't she stuck in the tower?
How do barbies plaits stay in place after her hair gets cut? Like that’s not how it works
LITERALLY HOW THE *UCK DID KURTIS GET THE TWO MAIN MOVIES FROM MY CHILDHOOD BRO. I HAD THEM ON VH TAPE OR DVD OR SOMETHING AND WATCHED THEM BOTH A MILLION TIMES.
KURTIS THIS WAS A VIOLATION ONE IS NOT ALLOWED TO BE THIS FUNNY SIMPLY WATCHING JUST A MOVIE 😭😭😭
The barbie voice repeating "BalLS" every 5 minutes is so funny to me
Ok but what about the new Pinocchio…
Could you watch the Hot Wheels acceleracers series? It’s in the same vein as these
It's embarrassing how many times I've watched the balls joke clips all over YouTube
i see kurtis is still keeping his title of “person with worst irish accent ever” when imitating the gnome ( 21:25)
ya hooo da ba yo
25:27 Well done my daughter!
Why her forehead  sooooooo big  Honestly  when I saw that I laughed for 30 no joke
I was doing my makeup while watching and did not expect to cry from laughing   My mascara got wrecked LOL
In Disney's talgled- I always appreciated the fact that Rapunzel would like- twist her hair up into a little hook on the side of her tower- that way the full weight of a human person wouldn't do that number on her neck like Kurtis mentioned- it was an extra detail I really appreciated them adding, because without the hook- that would surely hurt like hell-
this type of animation is so unsettling
bratz > barbies any day
i keep coming back to this video bc i’m so upset that rapunzel was reviewed and not fairy secret or princess charm school
Bratz Fashion Pixies was the movie that made me who i am today 💀 i LOVED that movie.
Otto moaning that’s it. -Random Barbie movie reviewer
You nosey cailíní’s 🤣
Selfish bratz
ya hooo da ba yo
you missed saying “it’s not snow it’s blow”
I lived and breathed for the Barbie movies as a kid 🤣🤣 the fairytopia and the mermaid movies were the shit
is it possible that kurtis would read all 20 and a half thousand comments?
kinda wish "horniest weasel" was a category during this oscar's.
“Do I wanna gnome” is an absolute bop
Excuse me but I subscribed for the extra greeting😠
The word “Balls” Kurtis:
its cuz u didn’t watch barbie princess academy which in my opinion is the best. That or Chrystal Palace. But I mean, fair game 👍🏼
this will forever be my favorite video I cant stop wheezing LMAO
I think about Kurtis aggressively twerking on the daily
okay wait but there is a fairy/pixie Barbie movie too???? i know i’m not trippin though cause when they had the glasses on to see the fairies, i remembered a similar scene in the barbie movie
These are high context movies, Kurtis.  You just don’t get it 🤦‍♀️.
Pulling on the hair wouldn't hurt because she wrapped it around the pillar
Newest member of kurtistown here, thank you for making me shit the bed laughing this morning 🌚 much love
Wood chipper I hardly know her
Kurtis revoked our extra greeting privileges and never gave them back 😔
thanks for the fucking spoiler alert.
In the brazilian dub, gothel's pet doesn't sound horny at all, just straight up sassy and mean.
please tell me that’s not your actual angry face
Kurtis you should watch the fairy secret Barbie movie you would love it
Oh man, he just said the words "secret tunnel" so normally..
15:37 Ah see this is a classic abduction by the moon presence. It happens.
does anybody remeber the bratz baby movie !!!!
The audacity to simply call the Bratz girls "Brianna's friends" instead of their names
There’s a different Bratz movie that has dwarves and the dwarves are a boyband with a song and dance number
"Barbied wire" is sending me 😂, "mattel me that" Also love the origin of the "bALLS" sound effect : this is one of my favorite Kurtis video
pls tell me there is a monster high version of gbis
I discovered you yesterday and you are now my favorite YouTuber! Your humor matches mine perfectly and your videos are so fun to watch. Keep up the good work!
Barbie had a whole virtual universe and it was amazing. I (my parents) payed actual money so i could buy the cute outfits and play the fun games and shit. They shut it down in 2011 and I still miss it every day. I am currently 22.
This will not sound real but when I was in primary school* we actually there a history of Barbie lesson and learned that the first ever Barbie Doll of Colour was released in the 1960's  *primary school in Ireland is what you attend from ages 4/5-12/13 depends on what age you enrolled Also for the bratz part that's how all Irish people speak all of us NO EXCEPTIONS.  also caliní means 'girl' in Irish
make me a grilled bacon beer battered belly:)
ya hooo da ba yo
5:58
I’m literally wearing a bratz shirt now this whole video I was cheering them on
"and Dylan twerks about it" 😂😂 this made me laugh out loud fr 😂
“Dylan walked so eboys could run their fingers through their hair” 😂
24:54 it really sounds like "yahoo! I'm a gnome!"
I have never laughed while snorting so much uncontrollably until this video.  I grew up watching both Barbie and Bratz movies, so I know both these films and I thought that shit was everything. Nothing is funnier to me than your commentary on it 🤣
the Oscars skit *hits* different now
The pixie world is just tripping on ac id
5:23 "long ass hair" ? How would you know?
Kurt is you made me spit take my coffee from laughing lolllllll
Lesson learned:Never watch Kurtis while drinking water
i’m dying at the “rapunzel is bald nowww” 💀💀
okay but barbie and the three musketeers or 12 dancing princesses is the best
I ALMOST DIED WHEN HE DIDNT DO THE EXTRA GREETING
This whole time I thought the VRG was Virgo??? 😂😂😂
DUDE I WAS SO HAPPY WHEN YOU DECIDED TO WATCH FASHION PIXIES THAT WAS MY FAVOURITE ONE
The garden knome actually has the most authentic accent and like angry old Irish man dialogue I LOVE IT
The amount of Barbie movies he could’ve watched he picked one of the worst ones omg I am furious  FIRST OF ALL: FAIRYTOPIA?? MERMAIDIA???PRINCESS AND T H E  P A U P E R?? 12 DANCING PRINCESSES?? DIARIES??? DUDE CMON!!!
This is porobably the 24th time ive seen this video and Kurtis's weird beef with the children in the barbie movie still makes me laugh so hard lmao
my favourite Barbie movie by far was the one where she turned out to be a princess and her aunt basically killed her mother and father so her daughter can take the throne or sum
Bratz will always be superior jsut realzked my YouTube pfp shit
Kurtis this is my comfort YouTube video
@20:51  hahaahahaha
guh
the usage of the boing sound effect in kurtis conner videos is unmatched
That edit at 20:30 is as good as ur gonna get
Wow ok I definitely saw the Barbie  Rapunzel movie several times as a kid…how did I not notice the animation is actually TERRIFYING😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
Barbie Rapunzel slapped, made me want to be creative and paint 🎨
✨BaLLs ✨
10:15 repunzel is bald now :D  11:20 REPUNZEL IS BALD 2:the shaving
Fashion pixies is a core memory for me
😏😏😏
4:52 I spent a year of my life as a young teenager being obsessed with Bobby Flay so I appreciated this jumpscare of a shoutout
Dyllan was bussing it down sesshual style
I had a great time wow 😌
watch monster high. now.
6:58 scrolltums??
I had a Barbie as Rapunzel game as a kid and it was pretty lit. I want to replay it now.
the music at 1:25 is from homestuck. why am i saying this
ya hooo da ba yo
Local News: Two teens found dead next to gnome house: Gnome suspected of the murder  Yesterday, a citizen came across two dead bodies next to a small house, the citizen reported this to the police, and upon investigation, a living gnome was found who claimed to have no idea what they were doing there.
6:35
DO I WANNA GNOME 18:43
the Zelda chest opening sound killed me
Personally I like barbie better. The idea of her was to empower young girls and women, with the idea that women can be anything they want. Personally I can see why adult didn’t want their kids to play with dolls that had showed a lot of skin and wore a lot of make up. The barbie body was made with appropriate proportional features.
dude i watched the barbie rapunzel movie when i was like, three on a vcr player and for a really long time i thought it wasn’t real. you just unearthed so many forgotten child hood memories
lol I think this dude is a virgin
Am I the only one that loves the weasel
11:00
havent seen it yet abd if bratz dont win i might just die
6:00
came for the extra greeting, stayed for the pornstache-mullet combo
9:36 of clearly kurtis you have never held the root of your hair and then pulled on it
Why is every 2000’s movie so saturated
There’s much better bratz movies, also you should watch my scene 😂😂
"thou thy curtains match thy drapes" lmfaooooo
25:02 this is great out of context
I gave you a like as soon as you said “do I wanna gnome?”
My favorite Bratz movie is alita battle angel
Ohh, I thought that the v was like the v from the VIM logo.
I wish I didn’t watch this
19:27
I cant believe kurtis screwed us over like this and I am beyond ashamed to have believed your lies and empty promises
leave penelope alone.
The gnome says "girls" in irish but he adds an extra s for no reason, the plural for girls in irish is just cailíní and he says cailínís And the random nonsense with random Irish slag with the accent makes that scene 10000x better
I'm sorry but Quentin Tarantino definitely wins horniest weasel in that bit.
I GOT A BARBIE AD 💀
the echoey "BALLS :)" sound is going to be on a loop in my idiot brain for weeks now, so thanks for that ig
I subscribed for the “no headwig?!” line
The Bratz's hair by itself takes the movies from an iconic 7 straight to a 9
"could a virgin have a podcast?" joe rogan:
the angrily twerking is sofunny to me
my favorite barbie movie is the one where barbie has a long lost sister and didnt know about her bc she was turned into a fucking pegasus (no not the forehead kid)
8:43 I love the elaborate setup to kurtis’ jokes bc i just KNOW he comes up with a punchline and then is like “how the fuck do i fit this into the video”
I was eating spaghetti for the second half of this video  The spaghetti proceeded to go up and out of my nose a total of 6 times
6:32
fave barbie and bratz movie of my entire childhood in one video?!??!??? hell yeah
barbie rapunzel was my favorite barbie movie when i was little and the only thing i remember about it was her mashing grapes with her feet to make paint LOL
Dude the bAlLs keep getting to me 😭😭💀
both of these movies have been emerged in y head for years
i come back to this just to see tje fucking weasel
your little skits make me beyond happy. this is exactly how my brain works, regardless of if I'm talking to someone or thinking to myself. <3
yall want a really scary movie? Bratz Super Babiez. The alien things were truly horrifying :,<
Bratz can’t compare to Barbie. There’s a reason it’s more popular. Smh I don’t think you have Barbie a fair shot. You watched a Barbie ripoff of a popular princess story and watched a bratz original storyline (ish, cause they probably got similar ideas from Barbie) instead of watching an honest Barbie movie that started multiple trends that still carry out through movies today. I wanna see a video series where you compare Barbie movies with other popular doll movies that have similar titles.
that was NOT enough time for me to get a snack. #kurtisisoverparty
Repunzle is bald now chain
Def prefer Barbie over bratz..  nothing beats the original classic Barbie movies and they’re so naturallly beautiful, bratz reminds me of the botched Instagram models these days lol
i never watched barbie movies growing up, however my favorite Bratz movies ever was the Sleep-Over Adventure. it actually used to scare me so bad but it was like a child friendly horror movie so I was allowed to watch it, and ill admit, I still enjoy that movie to this day
I liked the Bratz and the Myscene dolls because the friend groups were lit! But Barbie movies will always be true to my heart!!
i'm unsubscribing because i didn't get an extra greeting 😤
"Can a virgin have a podcast?" Every dude that uses low quality/high quality to describe "females."
Throw another bratz on the barbie mate
comfort video
Congrats. I woke up my baby by laughing so hard at this video. I subbed cause you're hilarious
I have to admit that the Bratz music really slaps. Like, yeah the Bratz movies with real people had fire soundtracks... But the animated ones do too!
Now review monster high I’m BEGGING yoy
Ballsz
Why is the gnome Irish? Why was it not a leprechaun?
Princess and the Pauper vs Bratz Rock Angels amirite
18:44 "do i wanna gnome"
18:37 HOLY SHIT THATS THE GNOME FROM KELDERS FARM I DRIVE BY THAT GNOME EVERYDAY I USED TO GO TO THE FARM AS A KID HOLY SHIT ITS IN KURTS VID.
As someone with long hair, yes it will hurt if you pull on hair directly. As someone who almost understands physics, it will only hurt if you pull on the hair directly from the scalp with no ease of pressure.
i went into this thinking there's no way anything could top a barbie movie, but wow, that bratz movie really blew me away
You gotta do this again with different movies
I actually had a college roommate who told me if you played with Bratz you were a whore. Well shit, being a whore was exactly what I was aspiring to achieve when I was 8 and just loved the fur stoles and shimmery y2k lip gloss.
calls other peoples name in bratz movie BUT CALLS THE 4 MAIN CHARACTER THAT IS THE WHOEL BRATZ FRANCIAUSE  'Briannas friends'
it's such a crazy coincidence I watched both movies when I was a kid! from all the movies he could have chosen, he chose the one I repressed for the last decade or so.
this is my comfort video. i watch it whenever i feel sad. i know this whole video word for word. i’m not ok 😭😭
is it just me or did kurt's eyes look bigger today than usual
i put this video on the chromecast, my mom being in the kitchen. "he looks so dumb." i think she likes you!
you should have watched bratz kids fairytale because although it doesn’t have a honry weasel, it does have honry wolf.
the best part is how Kurtis keeps shitting on Kelly through the whole video
i haven’t watched the whole video yet and i’m waiting for the weasel to say “give him to me uhh😩😩🤤”
I remember rapunzel purring her hair around one of these hooks (that houses in amsterdam have that you can put a rope through to help get furniture into your house through the window) and then tangle it down so that would technicly allow her to get that man up without her head hurting if she held the hair down on her side with her hands
6:54 You've heard of dick pics. Now get ready for..  Ball scrolls!
I'm hurt that Kurtis didn't give me an extra greeting. #KurtisConnerIsOverParty
Stephen walks way too much like Westly from the princess bride
16:39 I love how this guy talks
My little sister loved Bratz when she was 3. She had a bunch of dolls and like all the movies and watched them constantly, when she wasn't watching Barbie movies. To this day my nickname for her is Bratt. This video was such a nostalgic trip because I had to watch each of these dozens of times with her. Definitely needed a video like this.
B a l l s
The real tell here, no virgin owns an Airplane poster
if you look closely Barbpunzel actually wrapped her hair around the column of the window so the guy doesn't actually pull on her scalp. thats some attention to detail
Doth thou carpet match thy drapes 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂I’m at work trying not to laugh
I thought I'd seen every single Kurtis video but I discovered 4 tonight, including this one. How many more are there??? 😭 What else have I been missing out on???
Today I declined into a deep depression. The whole word felt dark. Not only did you not give us an extra greeting, but you DENIED to. Do you hate me or something? You may be in control of your life, but your in control of mine too. Next time, give me an extra greeting.
barbie vs bratz part 2 with princess and the pouper pls thank you
14:59
I still have the ps2 game
I'm sad i never knew about bratz :((
15:36
Monster high is better than both
kurtis wanted his action figures to come to life?? i was fucking terrified of that possibility
21:41 can't stop listening to this  But Kurtis angrily twerking is a whole mood n a half
i thought the letters had spelled virgo💪💀
The lack of extra greetings in this video has flared my depression 🥺
So is nobody going to talk about how the "apology" at the "do I wanna gnome" bit, says James Charles underneath. Subtle shade. Gotta love it
ok but he’s forgetting one.. MONSTER HIGH DOLLS
6:02
11:20 is so funny to me for no reason
Kurtis: "flying unicorns"  Every MLP Fan: "An alicorn?!?"
I love and hate that I've seen both these films and enjoyed them on my time, man what a load of memories are coming back.
i have never watched a barbie movie but i have watched the barbie life in the dream house show, and i have watched a couple bratz movies. anyways even though they are both dolls and mattel thought bratz was copying them or whatever they where sueing them about i still feel like both of them have different expectations for movies, it feels like barbie is a little more strict when it comes to the movies, and bratz are more chill and actually in with the times the movies where made in. i may just be biased because i like bratz movies more but i really feel like there is a difference of expectations for the movies director
12:10 The footsteps were good asmr tho👌
y'know what all of you should watch?  that one bratz movie where they get drugged in paris
Barbie or die! i have over 450 dolls! gen-Xers 4 eva!
please watch super baby bratz, it is teriffying
justice for 12 dancing princesses !!!!! 😩
I am distraught that kurtis didn’t choose mermadia for the barbie movie 😞 it’s by far the best one
“ oh no! She looks like what stubbing your toe feels like.” Favorite YouTube quote
I was rewatching this video, and it made me want to replay the old Barbie as Rapunzel PC game. Turns out there are two of them, and the one I remember is the 1997 version. Anyway, the point is, thanks for the nostalgia! and for your content in general. I can always count on the Mayor to deliver <3
please I am currently choking on my own laughter-  Everything about this is just- indescribably concerning but extremely hilarious.
I was never allowed to have Bratz dolls, I always wanted one though
scrotum scrolls
great, now i have "rapunzel is bald now" stuck in my head for eternity
this is the most biased video ive ever seen
I refuse to believe that weasel actually moaned like that LMAO!!
I don't know if it's the brandy or the comedy and editing, but this is about to be the video I watch to have a good day
I think Kurtis should turn Rapunzel is bald now into a full somg
this is one of kurtis' funniest videos bro im dying
I’ve never really seen Barbie rapunzel but gothel stealing rapunzel out of love for the king is just like the plot of maleficent with a few little changes
Chalkzone was such a good show. And Harold and the Purple Crayon, I have a head cannon that they're in the same universes
I went to a toy drive once and the only toy they had banned donations for was bratz
I'm really considering unsubscribing. Those extra greetings were like 83% of the reason I came here.
2:46 Jokes on you. Girls don’t fart
Rapunzel wrapped her hair around the pillar, thus, it would not hurt her at all.
ya hooo da ba yo
Nah because we need princess and the pauper vs rock angelz PLEASE (the balls part makes me lose my mind everytime I watch this AHSJDKKDLDK)
I was obsessed with Bratz🖤
7:52 NOT his hands fitting around her entire waist!!
i didnt like dolls that much but i LOVED monster high 😎
I want the exact photo from 19:07 to be my screen saver...
It is funny how I love owls, and my persona is basically a G R E AT  H O R N E D  O W L. Oh, wow.
That Bratz movie has the most iconic scenes ever and no one can tell me otherwise
The whole brats movie sounds like a roleplay my best friend would have come up with when we were like 7. The only difference was i would insist i had a sword
My god these 2 tapes were always in my sisters’ vcr on auto rewind. I had to always change the tape.
“Rapunzel is bald now” is more catchy than most of the songs this year.
scanning balls
My girlfriend is upset that you did not give us an extra greeting. Please fix
Mr. Curtis, could you please please consider watching (possibly reviewing) the legendary movies "The 10th Kingdom" they've been some of my favorite pieces of film since childhood, and I think you would truly enjoy them :)
Amazing video
Anytime I am upset, I will be coming back to this video. The very first video from Kurtis I ever saw was this and honestly I have never been happier it was this video because now I just laugh my ass off every time I see it
Guys what about polypockets?
As a firefighter I can confirm that the fire hydrants we use are actually nice gnomes that piss on the fire to put it out.
DO I WANNA GNOMMEE
Hedwig is a girl.
kurtis makes a stupid little joke and makes his stupid little laugh and i feel stupid little emotions
18:44 😭😭😭
yo creí que las letras eran por "VeRG*", pero bueno "Very Really Good" es very really good.
LOL dolls are produced by the same company as Bratz. They came back with the same doll, but with a bunch of tiny crap.
I used to have very long hair and I can reliably say that if it's in a braid or someone pulls at all of your hair at the same time, it doesn't really hurt. Obviously a man climbing it would not be good, but at least in Barbie's Rapunzel (in the clip you put in) her hair is wrapped around a pillar before going down the tower, so all of Stevan's weight would be pulling on the pillar, not her neck.
Kurtis, you should sing. Do covers and stuff
I always liked Myscene dolls because they had the body of a barbie but the hot face and clothes of bratz XD plus they had different features and functions like making their mouths move or they had working wings!! hahaha
anyone gonna tell kurt her name is Shelly not Kelly
this is my fav video of all time
Omg I have use to love that Barbie movie when I was little it is super weird looking now
the bionicle movies go hard
Easily one of the funniest videos. I cry laugh every time
dylan looks like that one kid from jinmy neutron
My mom banned Barbie’s but allowed bratz lmao
this is my comfort video
KURTIS CAN U REACT TOO "BARBIE VIDEO GAME HERO" CUZ THAT MOVIE IS SOMETHING.
Why is no one talking about MyScene dolls??? 🥺🥺🥺
that scene of the ken dollie grabing miss barbies waist to help her fucked me up when i was kid i was like his hands basically colosed around her entire stomach .......... thank u barbie once again for the unearthed body issues
Please do Monster High vs Rainbow High 🙏🏼
06:33
The fact that these were the only two Bratz and Barbie movies (and the like barbie fairy movie or whatever idek) I watched as a small child, you're unlocking memories, Kurtis. Especially the Bratz movie,  it felt like that movie was a dream, until now.
Do I wanna gnome?
ya hooo da ba yo, or whatever.
my fav Kurtis videeooooo uaghhh
*B A L L Z*
Funny enough, MatPat from Film Theory made a theory video about how the strain of Rapunzel’s hair is killing her 😂😂😂
Barbie Rapunzel? This movie is why I had nightmares when I was younger.
i always thought it was virgo i’m a fake fan!!
I’ve never laughed this much throughout a YouTube video.
“ you can’t sue people u don’t like just because you don’t like them”   America:  *I N C O R R E C T*
One of my favourite
Considering Gothel was all Rapunzel knew and was apparently like a (very bad) mother figure to her, as well isolated her, it makes complete sense knowing what I do about many abuse victims.  I still love *both* Barbie and Bratz. I played both games and watched all the shows and movies. But with that reference in mind, it makes sense to me what Rapunzel does.  I'm implying she was emotionally harmed many times by Gothel, btw, not physically.  Edit: what I know is it is super hard to leave for a range of reasons, namely starting with the fact that the abuser makes it very hard for them to see leaving as an option. That's how deep emotional harm and/or abuse can go. Edit2: Sometimes the abuser also has power on their side among the community as well. Just like Gothel has magic powers.
27? Pfft, I unlocked that (become a bitter old woman at 23) achievement nearly two years ago   The Rheumatoid Arthritis sped things up.   (😏🥁)
Thank you for pointing out the lack of sound in the fight scene it has bothered me since childhood
my absolutely favorite bratz movie is the one where theyre babies and they get superpowers and fight the aliens because that was a WILD RIDE
Fun fact: Otto from Rapunzel (the horny weasle) has the same voice actor as the english dub of Goku
ya hooo da ba yo
kurtis, i only have one question for you and one question only         *would you like another nail*
I haven't seen that barbie movie like 20 years and its crazy how much I remembered the scenes you showed!
I wonder if making the dancing pixies as evil was an attempt to keep kids away from club culture and drugs which then backfired cause I thought it was sick as fuuuk as a kid now I am obsessed with going to raves
E. Plurabus Anus
Title: barbie vs bratz  7 y/o me w my monster high dolls: 👁👄👁
The rapunzel animation is absolutely horrying
As a wife who angry twerks at her husband as a joke, I died at the sketch. 🤣🤣🤣
Chalk zone was the shit.
The AUDACITY you had to not watch Bratz Rock Angels 😭😭
I would love for you to watch a monster high movie which makes even less sense
wood chipper i hardly know her
bless you.
Both movies suck.... Bye-
“They unfortunately save her life” 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Kurtis and Kelly are on their enemies to bestie ark
no you have to watch bratz fairytale. the gnome boy band oh you gotta see it you gotta see it kurtis you just GOTTA SEE GOTTA YOU GOTTA
I remember the Bratz books were literally my childhood. There was this one about them being fairies that I just read over and over in school. I don't even remember anything about it apart from that, it feels like a fever dream. Edit: OK WTF I POSTED THIS AT THE START OF THE VIDEO AND THE FILM HE WATCHED IS THE PLOT OF THE BOOK I READ? I GUESS THEY JUST ADAPTED IT BUT THAT'S CRAZY IT WAS THE SAME ONE???? Also the Irish gnome is absolutely killing me why did they actually get him to speak Irish lmao, who did they think was going to understand it?
8:48 I'm pretty sure this was the plot of _Hedwig and the Angry Itch_
This is a clearly biased review
Rapunzel is bald now
Barbie better dolll 🤬🤬🤬
Barbie v Bratz is literally royals v rebels from Ever After High -- entertainment edition😂
Your mustache looks like two hairy dogs kissing. Change my mind
Both !!
yassification of bratz dad
*’ew’* - Chloe (reverb)
Monster high dolls are an honorable mention. The cartoons/movies and the doll series are so nostalgic.
No but barbie films were ICONIC for not having music in random scenes... it’s called ✨realism✨ besties
I can’t believe I ever watched barbie as rapunzle and never once questioned the fucking weird ass ferret
Bestie chose the worst of the barbie and bratz films 😔 as a stan and owner of multiple DVDs princess and the pauper/12 dancing princesses slapped and passion 4 fashion/genie magic were where it’s at 😌
as a barbie lover and someone who watches them whenever i get sad (which is all the time) kurtis picked the worst barbie movie to comment on but it was still very funny  also justice for monster high i bet their feel really left out rn
"What stubbing your toe looks like!"🤣
Aaaaa so thats how i thought that running in the living room away from the computer and then tip toe to my bed wont let my mom know that i was awake when i was little.
ya hoo da ba yo
BRO- THAT CROW GIRL WAS MY FIRST CRUSH
I will say as someone who's only familiar with the barbie Rapunzel movie through the video game, the traveling through paintings part was pretty cool
Rapunzel ties her hair around a banister duh Kurtis didn't you even watch duh movie?
hahaha
I loved Chalkzone! Me and my older bro would watch that and My life as a teenage robot on like a thick portable dvd player. Good times
she‘s not real but pls don’t make fun of big foreheads anyway that can be hurtful to very real people with big foreheads (and there‘s nothing wrong with big foreheads)
War flashbacks to when I watched Barbie and the Nutcracker seven times a week....
Rapunzel wraps her hair around something (usually a hook of some kind) so the dude can climb it. I feel like this has been addressed in many versions of the rapunzel story. Looks like in this one, she wraps it around the window frame somehow before the dude climbs it.
Can we *please* talk about how Stephan looks like he came straight out if the sims
Great now I’m going to have  ✨BALLS✨ Stuck in my head all day
Owls get 'Hooty'
11:49
Bratz is just better in every way tbh
love the editing and that it was a review. I always forgot how chaotic 90's/early 2000's animation was
Kurtis: *makes a really bad gnome joke* Also Kurtis: *immediate regret*
kurtis is a bratz stan? king
Hearing you say that you're 'talking about d*cks and balls way too much for a Barbie movie,' made me spit out my beer.
Everytime I want your videos I find myself laughing ever minute
"The fits go hard" 😂
I have not been “ weak “ from laughter in, I guarantee, years. This video changed that for me today 😹😹
careful where you walk guys... kurtis has dug 276,000 holes so far!
the weasel gets me everytime
Nobody ever talks about the MyScene dolls
I believe that kurtis conner is my soulmate🚨
18:43 i am laughing my buttcheeks off
My mom took away my bratz dolls bcs she found me kissing them 💜
Late af but my youngest sister has been quoting that weasel since she was born/movie came out. Every. Single. Day.
I completely forgot how much Kurtis hates Kelly and I am currently struggling to breath edit: i mean all the children
Pls review another bratz movie omg
The video game is better. Paint like 6 scenes and done and the intro song is a banger. In reference to Barbie.   Further update on Bratz. Best are the real people especially the detention scene, iykyk. Or Forever Diamondz
Holy shit that is Anjelica Huston!!! In the barbie movie.
I feel like I had a fever dream where I watched the Barbie Rapunzel movie as a child...   As to why Rapunzel couldn't just fly away with Penelope from the get go, I think I've got this one. * Ahem*: "Penelope is from an ancient, wise, powerful race of flying -Eagles- er, *Dragons* , and actually it would have been too obvious if Penelope had just flown Rapunzel from the Tower Doom from the beginning, so really it was on Rapunzel's shoulders to subvert Gothel's expectations by escaping on her own _before_ Penelope could help. Penelope finally helped at the end _because_ the actions of Rapunzel already had effectively subverted Gothel's attempt at becoming an all powerful -dark Lord- er..., restrictive jerk of a 'stepmother'."   I think I got that right.
bratz ate
"Kelly looks like what stubbing your toe feels like" 💀💀
Ngl but Bratz music slapped way harder than any Barbie song🤣
now do ever after high vs decendecents
9:35 Missed opportunity to play a clip of Rapunzel going "ouch!" from "The Mind Robber."
Wtf is chalk zone, is that a rip off of Bert's chalk drawings they jump into in Mary Poppins?
Why no extra greeting
You promised me EVERY SINGLE VIDEO clown. 😡
I remember that when I was little, I really wanted Bratz dolls, but my mom didn't like them because they had "unrealistic features". Cut to me being self conscious of my teeth at a young age because barbie teeth are all straight and pearly white.
You forgot to mention Penelope (wow I can’t believe I remembered the dragons name) had a fear of flying high. Got gel put the window out of Penelope’s reach.
My haki off the meter fam goon
Holy shit, Barbie Rapunzel has a pet Spyro the Dragon!
I was a huge “Barbie & the Rockers” series fan (just aged myself) was excited to see a cartoon with a black girl including Jem, and Josie & the Pussycats. However, I was super excited for my daughter to be exposed to Bratz and Monster High dolls and the movies because of the way they were diverse in a way that didn’t feel forced, but normal. Way cooler than Barbie 😑
bratz dancing is so funny
12:22 kurtis' reaction LOL
THE WEASEL LOL
Kurtis has undoubtedly ruined Rapunzel for me with all the jokes, Kelly's forehead and of course, Otto's moans. The video was nice but there are way better Barbie movies than Rapunzel. Princess Charm School or Fashion Fairytale would have been better picks. Barbie Diaries is another amazing one but the animation quality... It's really something.  I'm still mad Bratz won but the video was amazing.
This video is so funny im dying
third time commenting. I regret every decision I've made coming up to this moment
20:55 are those mush rooms ??? Are they on shrooms  Wtf is this part also 20:41 there more mushrooms kurtis did you miss this Ps fuck Kelly
Angry twerking I lost my shit with this.
6:35
I'm glad the weasel didn't sound like this in the german dub. I would've been scarred for life
kurtis: i am NOT a virgin! kurtis: *makes a video about Barbie vs Bratz.*
Sighorny Weasel
Highly unlikely you'll see this but your podcast is so comfornting for me. I listen to it while trying to sleep, while in school, while at the doctors office. Your podcast makes me feel more normal
Funny story: I remember watching bratz fashion pixies as a kid andaround that time they also released those fairy glasses in the movie where you could see the pixie world (it was just one pink tinted glasses) . We couldn't afford them, so me and my younger sisters would wear old  3D cinima glasses to pretend we could see the fairy world. Good times
You picked the best Barbie movie🤣
missed the chance to say “testi-scrolls”
The Bratz dolls were so stylized that they made Barbie look realistic in comparison.
Gasp no extra greeting
i’m so glad you picked that bratz movie because it was my fav growing up
This is officially my new comfort video
You should talk about the terrible live action movie
Can we get some Polly Pockets in on this war?
i haven't seen this for a while, and JUST when im about to watching another """"kurtis conner""" comedy show, IM NOT RECEVING MY FUCKING EXTRA GREETING?  disappointed.
Not the fire crotch joke 😂😂😭😭😭
To be fair, there’s a whole lot of better Barbie movies 😂 my all time favorites are 12 dancing princesses, Diamond Castle and Mariposa!
"Balls"
21:57 Imagine the awkward silence Kurtis was hearing while he was shooting this scene. Just.
15:54 “Dylan walks so Eboys could run- their fingers through their hair” 😂 He never missed with the comedy this was such a good line omfg
I’m on a Kurtis Conner rabbithole and I just came from a Art Attack reference and now a Chalk Zone reference?! I’m convinced we all have the same childhood but all the memories are in Kurtis’ head.
Kurtis, as another 27 year old, your videos have provided no end of comfort to me and my jaded, bitter prematurely old lady heart. It means so much to see such a funny and kindhearted, wellmeaning guy with a 70's pornstache talk about Barbie vs. Brats. The only thing that could make this better is if you cover Monster High and how it was fucked up by middle aged Karen moms who wouldn't support it in spite of its diversity, killer and genuine exploration of fashion, and homeage and tribute to classic horror.
absolute comedy 👌
How do people think you are? I subscribed cause he could get it 🤣
Its funny to see kurtis getting freaked out by the barbie kids and not the entire characters of bratz, bro they're scarier, even the bratz kids are terrifying
-omg i thought the first part of this was an out of context vid that was just done badly_
Bloody hilarious 🤣🤣🤣
High key glad they never put music over the Gothal Stefan chase scene. The sounds of their heels clicking off the ground 😌👌
The bratz movie had me cracking up LMAO
Should have watched Genie Magic
you should’ve watched princess charm school
the bratz movie was literally just barbie a fairy secret with a different plot... right down to the flying horses
Barbie movies = chaotic good Bratz movies = chaotic evil IMO  Bratz has such baaddd animation
So biased against Rapunzel. Also for the whole hair climbing thing- it's tied around a pole. I understood that at 10 ffs
i m so high on laughing gaz the rapinzel is bald now thing made me laugh like crazu
I'm crying over the horny weasel!! 😩😭🤣
love how mini skits just have their own plotlines in this channel, who would've thought of rapunzel having her weave snatched followed by a little jingle
Bratz pixies movie hit so hard in elementary school especially the pixie raving scene lmao!
Kutis: could a virgin have a podcast?  ME: well yeah theres joe rogan  "FOLKS "
I'll always be a mf BRAT QUEEN 👑 Barbie could mf neveeeeea 🤧🙌🏽
"I'm not hating *blushes* the fits go hard". You don't say? Hm, maybe they did sexualize little girls, little poc girls, who now, live hyper sexualized lives that deconstruct family units and encourage a high consumption lifestyle. Keeping poor people down from every angle... but no, they're just toys 🤫
I honestly did not expect Bratz to have such a big impact on generation's style and beauty now that we're pretty much adults and basically just reverting back to childhood tf
In Brazil there is a huge meme about the Rapunzel movie because in the Brazilian version because Otto that is the animal of the witch on the Barbie Rapunzel movie says "pega ele, frita ele, faz purê" with such a weird voice and is such a weird thing to say. For real in Brazil everybody knows this but I think that the biggest part of people here don't even know that is from this movie.
that that that that that that that that
9:33 i dont think it would...hair is dead cells and shes using the pillar to wrap her hair round to the pillar is getting pulled on because of the friction and her hair follicles are fine  Edit:when you like an 11 year olds comment talking about something that he doesn't really understand
make another one with princess and the pauper 😭
I will keep coming back to this video for "do I wanna gnome"
Legit thought 'Small Soldiers' was some kind of fake memory I barely even remembered. You unlocked parts of I brain I didn't know were there
the noise i made at the hedwig thing, bonus im p sure hedwig is female
those arent pixie glasses those are LSD glasses.
It’s gonna be Barbie that movie was fire
okay but barbie as rapunzel was literally one of the worst barbie movies,, you gotta watch barbie and the twelve dancing princesses
6:10 its even worse considering that a dominatetix is called a mistress, so made of that what you will
ok so Kurtis roasts Kelly but doesnt say a word how weird babies in the Bratz movie look like?? they barerly have a nose
me being irish made the gnome bit so funny i almost started crying from laughter
Okay i loved this🤚😭
i love the Bratz dolls but the Barbie Movies are just fucking Iconic
21:38 LMFAO
bruh i remember when i was a little kid and my sister was super into bratz.
Thanks for getting "rapunzel is bald now" stuck in my head
why did kurtis make me care about this?
I was very nervous clicking on this video because nothing in the world goes harder than the Barbie movies and I didn't want to hear Kurtis shitting on them.
BARBIE RAPUNZEL WAS MY SHIT
pretty girl you’re like peaches 😍
"I watched this days ago and i can't stop thinking about this weasel" THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS NOOOO!!
when he said if u wanna grab some snack do it now my mom asked me to pick up my little brother. now im back and i feel really excited for the 2nd part, i made coffee and all
Wtf
Okay. A bit late but about the question if it hurts when people climb her hair: shouldn't hurt much if she wraps her hair around something else, if done right, it should transfer the pull from her head to the object.
Bratz for the fucking win
Missed a  "Woodchipper? I hardly know her"
Just laughed so fucking hard at this
Why would you chose one of barbies worst movies and one of bratzs best movies for this 😭😭 !!! Should have watched Princess and the Pauper
"every movie needs a horny weasel"
The way I laughed
You forgot that Penelope was scared of flying. You also didn't mention Penelope's dad.
i need kurtis to see bratz kidz sleepover adventure bc that disturbed me as a kid
She! Is! A! PIXIE!
I forgot that I already watched this but it’s still just as good the 2nd time. Lmao
I need Kurtis to react to a Monster High movie 😭😭
Polly Pocket will forever be undefeated ❤️ Gotta give love to her!
the GNOME i died
i watch this so regularly just for the rapunzel is bald now moment
Just going to say that a female perspective on this would have really added to the analysis
Who remembers the Barbie repunzal computer game
Wow kurt boy legit created a wholeass podcast to excuse his virgin merch
I think rapunzel didn't scape with penelope because gothel would've hurt penelope's dad or smth
vrg stands for verga
Yeah it would EFFING HURT SO MUCH. this is why im a fan of "Into the Woods". Rapunzels is like ow ouch OWWWW when anyone climbs her hair lol.
8:57 C'mon dude!! Hedwig is a femaaaale!!
so no headwig 😪
Kurtis i’m late to the punch here, but i’d love to see you review the mo-capped barbie podcasts. they’re actually really wholesome and funny. one of them features barbie cosplaying as GLaDOS, which is just…something i never thought I’d see in any lifetime, much less this one
You just happened to watch one of the lowest rated Barbie movies. Watch a good one like Barbie princess charm school or princess and the popper. Barbie Mermaidia is good too
*Do Owls get horny?* Kurtis clearly hasn't seen Helluva Boss
very disappointed you didnt watch the best barbie movie: barbie and the princess charm school
"... barbie as rapunzel" me, silently: yuss
I feel like old barbie movies are something you can’t talk about. you just have to experience it.
Missed out on the opportunity to call them "scrote scrolls"  Will edit if he makes the joke later on lol
19:35 "absolute power move." Body-ody-ody-ody
That "Do I wanna gnome" part sounds like someone in Home Depot questioning on whether or not to buy a bunch of garden gnomes which are on sale.
The bratz movie was better but omg that whole shit felt like a dream I would have on a 45° fever
It didn’t hurt rapunzels neck because she wrapped it around the pole so the pressure is on the hair and the pole
Who comes here everyday?
18:18
😅 it would hurt if Rapunzel didn't tie it off the thing is is she tied it off so it doesn't hurt cuz a lot of girls probably like me know this but if you hold your hair really tight and brush it it doesn't hurt as bad especially if you have nots but if you don't then it tugs on your head and it hurts so as long as Rapunzel ties off her hair it won't hurt 😅
Mattel sued MGA for ownership of Bratz because the creator was an employee at Mattel when creating the Bratz line meaning they had artistic copyright over it and won several times in court.
I’m just here because I saw your mullet in the thumbnail and it is glorious 👍❤️
Kurtis, you need to watch the scene of the dwarves (same model as the gnomes in this movie) from Bratz Kids Fairy Tale from 2008 do an entire boyband sequence.
22 mins tho lol
Hey now, Penelope was afraid if heights so that’s why her flying in the second half is climatic. Also, Gothel didn’t think of her as a liar till afterwards
who else paused and screenshot at the 11:06 mark?
That brats movie literally felt like a fever dream
im convinced the kings in the barbie movie are just divorced and having custody issues
There are movies of myscene... 😗
I’ve come back to this video quite a few times and every single time I laugh so hard at the appearance sound with the children and then kurtis screaming and idk something about it just warms my heart
And Dylan twerks about it... Yeah...
There are also myscene dolls... I feel like we're erasing them a lot... It's only Barbie or Bratz... And that's it? NO!
the mean hoes weasel stole the stage
Bald kurtisis a vibe
BROOOO THE BRATZ AND BARBIE WERE MY CHILDHOOD!!!❤️❤️ I loved them both so much!!😂😂😂
11:52
the pure like disappointment in himself after "do I wanna gnome " caught me so off guard that I started cry laughing, that should not have been as funny as it was
Have you ever tried dubbing movies?  I think you would be great at it.
It could be because I never seen Bratz growing up, but Barbie in The Princess and the Pauper is the best musical film ever created and is better than anything Disney will ever make and nothing will change my mind
Bratz's Forever Diamondz soundtrack alone ends Barbie's whole career. Barbie can have a whole movie about being a popstar, but she'll never do "Ooooh Fashion"
I THOUGHT I HADNT WATCHED TEH BRATZ MOVIE BUT THAT SCENE WHEERE THE MOM HANDS THE WANDS TO THEM BROUGHT BACK SO MANU MEMORIES THAT FELT LIEK A FEVER DREAM
1:27 fun fact! That’s Cardi bs cousin
I used to love the barbie movies lol :)
"Could a virgin have a podcast?"  Boy, do I have bad news for you about podcasters...
UM BARBIE RIDING CAMP>>>
comfort video <3
Penelope looks like Spyro
God, you're at three million subscribers- that's nuts.
🔫😢THE INTROOOOO ;-;
Do i wanna gnoooome
10:18 Uncle Richie?
This video has made me laugh so much! 😂 but I’m a die hard fan of Bratz.
I personally think Bratz are better and much more iconic (ex. the belly piercing and their fashion style) i feel like Barbie is just more for white rich girls, while Bratz feels like they're your friends or maybe they look like you so you like them  I *am* incredibly biased tho
Bratz
"Do I wanna gnome" was one of the top 3 best lines in this video
The mermaid barbie slapped tho
the fact that i wasn’t allowed to have bratz not for any of the other reasons you mentioned but because they were called bratz
Curtis Konner is my favorite comedian, I really like it when he makes jokes like "I am not what I create". Stay funny internet man.
PLEASE do more on barbie or brats!!!
You could play an IMAX movie on Kelly's forehead
6:33
FINALLY someone remembers chalk zone!!! I was starting to think it was just a fever dream i had when I was 12.
hedwig is a girl!!! LOL
NOO you have to watch Barbie princess and the pauper this is unfair representation
wish you watched Barbie swan lake. best Barbie film
Bratz video games go so hard rock angelz for PS2 one of the best games of all time
I was so invested in the Rapunzel review I forgot this was a video about Barbie vs Bratz
The vrg just means verga to me
7:52 Stephan's hand is the size of her fuckin waist bro
Barbie wasn't created by Mattel. Barbie was created by a woman named Ruth Handler and was eventually bought by Mattel.
Dude... I love this, thank you
Gothel kinda looks like drag Tom Scott.
"Rapunzel is bald now" is still so fucking funny and catchy god
BUT NO OK FINE THE KELLY IS UGLY IN THE MOVIE BUT THE DOLLS ARE CUTE AND THEY ARE SUPERIOR AND PERHAPS BETTER THAN BARBIE HERSELF OK BYE
Barbie Fairytopia is Lit
BRING. THE. INTRO BAVK. IBE SAID IT ONEV AND ILL SYA IT AGAIN.   .
As someone who grew up on these barbie movies, the nostalgia this brought back is focking insane. I loved these movies so much and I have this vague memory of the painting scene being an absolute banger. Dang, now I wanna rewatch them all
did you just refuse to give us an extra greeting? what are we subscribing for kurtis.
I’m in love with the editing 👌
I guess the gnome is gonna be crwaling back to them
Dylan twerking to “Body” by Megan Thee Stallion 💀😂
the horny weasel is the direct ancestor of cheasel t. weasel from foodfight(!)
u fool. watch the barbie fairytopia movies…then u will understand…
Hedwig is a girl and I know that’s irrelevant but I have a bone to pick with him now
had me cackling 30 seconds in 😹
Kurtis next HAS to be Bratz Superbabyz because that movie is TRAUMATIZING. I have vivid nightmares to this day about it.
How DARE YOU INSULT KELLY AND NOT GOTHELS CHIN
SHOUT OUT TO SMALL SOLDIERS!! WOO WOO!
i love how the entire budget for the bratz movie was put into the animation of the girls hair
Barbie repunzel used to be one of my favourite movies. I even got a Penelope toy one Christmas 😅 you'd push it's tummy and it would ask you to tell her a secret. Watching this video has shattered my childhood, it's such a bad movie 😅
this was my favorite barbie movie.
6:58 Kutis made a whole new meaning to the acronym SS
Give him to me.                                          😩
KURTIS YOU NEED TO REVIEW ALL BARBIE MOVIES. ILL THROW MY MONEY AT YOU
Ok but Bratz Rock Angels ? Iconic. Bratz Forever Diamonds? Classic. Bratz Girls Really Rock? Amazing. Bratz Fashion Pixies? Fucking CHEFS KISS BRO. And of course, who could forget Bratz Starrin’ and Stylin’?! The features on the DVD were great! Plus the cute carrying case that had an alternate cover art was awesome! As a kid, I was introduced to Barbie before Bratz, naturally bc Barbie had been around for a long time, but Bratz are so much more unique with their styles, skin tones and cultures, although not often times referenced, they were implied a bit, especially in the live action Bratz. I had sooo many Bratz dolls and video games and decorations and posters, I loved the websites they’d have and the different versions like Bratz Boyz, Bratz Kidz, Bratz Babiez, Bratz Petz, etc, and with the comeback they’re making a lot of people have realized that Bratz have had an insane amount of influence on the current trends that are kind of bringing back early 2000s trends with little twists and spins to them. Barbie had great video games and when they would release dolls based on popular franchises and movies it was great, but Bratz did more than that and made their own mark without really relying on pop culture. Barbie is great, but Bratz did something different
6:32
at 5:17 what the fuck is in the background????? the picture looks idek...
petition for kurtis to react to more barbie movies since rapunzel is objectively the worst of the classics
if you watched barbie magic pegasus it woulve been different
how about when Barbie launched My Scene in 2002 tho. tea
If she's a pixie, shouldn't she be small and have wings?
I guess Gothel is a sorceress, but she's still an old lady! Kick her ass!!
BRATZ for life :3333
the amount of times I've watched this video now is uncanny
WHY IS THE GNOME IRISH FFS , YEE CAILÍN GET WAY OUT OF THAT
Are we not gonna talk about how Kurtis made an Arctic Monkeys parody? Kurtis, please drop the full version on Spotify
The holding myself accountable and apology was amazing-
10:30 I THOUGHT BARBIES EYE WAS A VAGINA
6:34 - balls timestamp
6:33 the echo annihilated me.
My favorite clip of that horny weasel: https://youtu.be/izAoiAral4g  Edit: It's also at 10:58 in this video.
isn't that prince dude that barbie fell in love with her brother. either there's something sketchy going on or I'm really confused  ok no I was just confused. I just realized that the dude she fell in love with was the other king's son, so they are, in fact, not siblings
Ahh the E Pluribus Anus flag
HORNY WEASEL FTW!!!!  🦴
I grew up watching both Barbie and Bratz. Barbie Rapunzel was literally my favorite one. The baby fashion designer in me was enthralled with the idea of a magic paintbrush that could make any dress I wanted. I don't remember liking Bratz or Barbie more, they kind of just had different vibes and I loved both. :) Edit: if you thought the weasel was bad, you should see Preminger from Princess and the Pauper 🤣🤣🤣
As someone who watched this movie an unfortunate amount of times as a kid, and would replay the weasel's lines because they were so fucking weird, and have brought this up whenever anyone mentioned the Barbie movies to absolutely no avail... I feel validated. I feel seen. The re-enactments had me dying, Kurtis' impression of that line is too much :'D
not even a question barbie wins
But what about the american girl doll movies
The "rapunzel is bald now" always gets me.
i used to watch barbie movies with my sis and even though i acted like i didnt wanna... they were bomb
I'm devastated that you chose one of the worst barbie films ;-; 12 dancing princesses??? Princess and the pauper??? Fairytopia: Mermaidia??????? Cmon
The weasel's name is Otto, and my name is Otto, so im very uncomfortable
I remember I once impulsively watched a bratz live action movie late at night and I genuinely enjoyed it
i lost power due to snow the other day and i’m not fucking kidding I went up the road to get better reception to use my data and i watched the entirety of Barbie Fairytopia Mermaidia. it was also like 2 am when I got home. best fucking night of my life
PLEASE WHY DID I NOT REALIZE THE SNOW JOKE
Oh you call yourself a PC gamer? Tell me what you know about Barbie Makeover on Windows 98 🤣
You gotta watch the barbie a fairy secret, seriously the funniest barbie movie
Bratz kids rapunzel outsold Barbie rapunzel easily
Yanno Barbie's Rapunzel really seems to be a lot more similar to Cinderella 👀
this truly is one of kurtis’ most funniest videos. would not recommend eating or drinking while watching!
I always love bratz more because I have big lips and so did they .......so as a kid I was really happy about that Since big lips when I was little were considered ugly
hedwig is a girl
I love the do I wanna gnome <3
11:06 is my new profile pic for everything
👍👍👍
the only thing missing from this video is bibble
I still think the Bratz dolls are creepy and sexualized. I mean, I feel like you have to be playing dumb, if you pretend that pouty, come-hither expression on their face isn’t sexual. They weren’t even initially allowed to have NOSES, because that’s ~unfeminine~ I guess. They’re also supposed to be TEENS? like, people can’t be surprised that girls nowadays are sucked into the toxic Instagram culture where 13-year-olds bend over backwards to make themselves look like adults, get lip injections, cake themselves in “sexy” makeup, and overall throw away their childhoods and open themselves up to predatory males on the internet, out of desperation to be accepted and “mature.” I feel like female people are brainwashed from birth to cater our lives toward male approval and making sure we are “fuckable” to men, and we convince ourselves that’s somehow empowering. And if you call this crap out, people assume you are “shaming” the women who think fashion and makeup are fun or something. We are desperate to defend ANY choice a women makes as a “feminist” choice, it’s so weird.
Omg I remember watching and loving that bratz movie when I was little and I forgot what it was so thank you for reviving part of my childhood
Literally find it hilarious that Kurtis used a Arctic monkeys reference
this is middle school humor for middle school topics. awesome
23:50 kills me
Bratz stole the plot from They Live
Here 6 months later to explain why the prince climbing Rapunzel’s hair wouldn’t hurt (at least not that bad):  She wrapped her hair around the pillar a couple times before letting it down to reduce to tension. It’s like when you’re combing out a tangle and you hold the middle of the hair section to reduce the pain.
“Weed the garden”  … She’s RAPUNZEL  Let that sink in  RAPUNZEL
Bratz Fashion Pixies was my favorite fucking movie. Deserved ❤️
This was a banger video, thanks Kurtis
i did a try not to laugh with this video and my gosh was it hard
I owned this movie in preschool and this unlocked some deep memories
Ok wait this Bratz movie is iconic
am i rewatching this bc i cant go to sleep rn? yes
who edited this video because wow it's hilarious both editing and commentary
9:52 The 10th Kingdom series has an episode where a main guy climbs up using a girl’s hair and it was much more realistic and painful(although funny) than all fairytales present
you did not do barbies movies justice with this
7:52 physically impossible. there’s no possible way someone’s hands can wrap that far around your waist. it’s unfair that this is what has been made to be the beauty standard
I remember loving fashion pixies when I was younger I used to dream about going into the mountain 😂
so if simbaline and Brianna were babies when their mom disappeared and their mom disappeared 10 years ago..... so these girls are 10 maybe 11?
6:33
As someone who watched all the Bratz movies and all the Barbie movies being honest the princess charm school was the top tier old Barbie movie
I fucking died with the “Do I wanna Gnome?” 😂😂😂
Okay but hear me out... Polly Pocket
The angry twerking had me in tears 😭
Cheese.
Vrg = virgin
Super Mario Sunshine be like
✨🧚‍♀💕balls💕🧚‍♀✨
I love how barbie’s “balls” has the exact intonation it needs for it to be used as meme
ya hooo da ba yo
My mother REFUSED to get me anything brats related because she said they looked like Sluts so i was only allowed barbie dolls i was very upset by this.
this is my favourite Kurtis Conner vid
if you watched “Barbie: The Princess and The Pauper” you would’ve liked it soooo much better. That and “Barbie: The Princess and The Rockstar” were my favorite movies as a kid
I would like to see this video again but Barbie’s Princess & The Pauper vs. Bratz: Rock Angelz or Bratz Kidz: Sleep-Over Adventure
As someone with a face built like Kelly's I am TRIGGERED
Barbie movies have gotten better over the years....
Have yall seen the new monster high dolls? 🤢  They took all the coolness away, it makes me genuinely upset
I have watched this movie so many times when i was a kid but now i look back at it it looks so bad lol (the barbie movie)
3:35 completely random but I HAVE THAT YASMIN DOLL I NAMED HER DEVAERAH
the reverbed "balls" still gets me to this day  i'm a almost twenty year old child :(
Tell me why I thought the v r g in the background stood for very righteous guy  I’m stupid lol ;D
Even though I believe you chose right between Barbie vs Bratz, I can't believe a better Barbie movie wasn't chosen. Like Princess and the Pauper songs are a bop to this day. Also Kurtis, sorry but, by making this video a contact was signed to where you have to review more of their movies.
i will stand by the fact this is the best video kurtis has ever released
this is also me when i am a gnome pissing on a fire hydrant
I miss my extra greeting. I feel abounded.  As a proud member of kurtis town, it hurts my soul not to be greeted by my mayor. I am crying. I am upset. 0/10
Penelope the dragon had a fear of heights! She’s couldn’t fly that high earlier in the story and was able to over come her fear to help save Barbie!
Your edits are straight fucked and I am here for it
6:33 you know what it is
Who’s gonna tell Kurtis about Barbie and a fairy secret too 😨
So are we just not gonna talk about gothels face
I love that you used the Matrix as an example of a chase scene without music lol, that movie has a great score and it made me laugh really hard.
HOW AM I JUST NOW NOTICING THE GUITAR HERO II THING ON THE SHELF????
Bless you
I’m in tears rn 😭
24:48 those are alicorns not unicorns
That gnome used to give me nightmares 😭
I bless him
Gotta say in terms of logo, bratz wins. Hands down.
Hi
As someone who is an actual cowboy, this Canadian cowboy merch is s tier
Kelly was replaced by Chelsey in 2011, fun fact... also, Hedwig is a girl
I used to want those pixie glasses SO BAD. I remember having like actual dreams about them
For a long time, my 2 favorite people-names were Penelope and Stephen, but I never knew why. As soon as you mentioned "Barbie as Rapunzel", I instantly had a blast from the past and recalled that this was my favorite movie on VHS when I was 5. So THAT'S where those names come from. Every person named Penelope is named after that purple dragon:)
Dang kurt, this video never gets old
The greendale community flag made the video
Hedwig is a girl
Yay I hated the extra greeting thing
Of all the barbie movies😭
leaving a comment cause im not a jerk 🤞
There were multi races of Barbie while I was growing up, but the issue has always been that they never modified any of the facial features, they just made Barbie dark skinned or tan sometimes. (I was born in 1987)
Is it just because it’s 2am or is this the funniest kurtis video ever
Monster High Vs. Ever After High
I don't hate kids and I agree with everything you said about Kelly. That fivehead.
Kurtis mustache looks like gothels weasel
Topuic
Some of my friends couldn't play with bratz. I could though, I had barbie and bratz, playing with dolls was fun when I was a girl. I loved sailor moon too.
i was always wierded out by that weasel. like every barbie movie has something off about it. no lie though the best barbie movie is barbie swan lake. trigger warning kelly is in it 😬
Allow me Kurtis mmmm 🤣
I just started recollecting dolls at the age of 25 : ). I’m so happy 😁
the horny weasel is so iconic
this was my whole childhood
do a video series watching/reaacting to MPGIS on YouTube!!! its fucking hilarious and they use barbies - pls!!! check it out at least
the brat chase scene music is just that music on the pacer test
That chalk zone reference
This was a great video when I watched it
"Uh oh! Barbie has done a crime! Time to put her in jail! With the new Barbie wire play set, Barbie and the girls can sit in jail for life because of their crimes!"
“Rapunzel is bald now”
6:33
should’ve done mermaidia😩😩😩
Kurtis you HAVE to watch princess charm school
B A L L S (echoechoecho)
Barbie is flawless and I love everything barbie with no critique. Idc about any valid points you have in this video. I'm not having it!
You’re a man so your opinion on Barbie doesn’t matter sorry not sorry
I've watched this video enough to sing along to the "Rapunzel is bald now" perfectly lol
The "so no headwig?" joke took me tf out, not even gonna lie
DO MONSTER HIGH
My mom wouldn't let anyone buy me Bratz dolls because she didn't like that they were called "brats" lol
20:53 what if the hose the firefighters use was stuck on the on the other end of the gnome. getting chased would be like, "im gonna take a shit on you!"
this is low-key the funniest video i’ve seen in years
yeah, Kelly *SUCKS*
I mean technically if she held her hair the right way it wouldn’t pull on her scalp/neck but she would basically be holding up a grown man therefore rapunzel is buff af
Please do Barbie snd the swan Princess PLEASE. Skunkchild
do another one, do barbie Pegasus or whatever
I wish kurtis would teach me to dance
I can’t be the only one who thinks the weasel sounds like Hisoka. Did he get a new nen that lets him turn into a horny weasel
I’m going to get a tattoo that says “Sigourney Weaver is a Horny Weasel” right now
8:04 imagine liking the man's walking animation so much you screenshot it to use for a future drawing
I always have and always will be a barbie girl, but you litterly picked the worst one to watch besides island princess. you could have at least watched barbie mermaidia or the 12 dancing princess
"Doth thou carpets match thine drapes?" - Kurtis Connor, 2021
I actually wonder something. I used to have this set of trophies in a wooden doll house I used to have. A couple years ago I noticed the Bratz logo was on those trophies. I never had a Bratz doll.
Kurt I am begging you to watch and review the tv series Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse, or at least do another bratz vs barbie movie video - this is my favorite video ever
That Weasel still haunts me to this day and I haven’t watched this movie in over five years
6:58    *”Scroll-tum”*
I was obsessed with both of these💀
It would be so amazing if you covered the my scene dolls movies. I had EVERY single one of them growing up and even little carrying cases for some of them holy shit this video unlocked deep memories from my childhood.
I used to have a few Barbie VHS tapes that I would watch every single day as a kid but one day my rapunzel one disappeared, now I’m convinced my mom heard the weasel making his horny noises and burned it. RIP.
I think you need to watch a better Barbie movie 😭😭
please do more of these pls
BRUH YOU DIDNT EVEN WATCH THE BEST BARBIE MOVIE !!!! 😵😵😵
Headwig is actually a girl sir
You picked some of the most low budget movies and it's great I never new there was a Barbie movie so bad😂
Funny to me, I always hated dolls, I got two dolls for my 6th chirstmas. A Barbie and a Bratz. I beheaded the Barbie and I cherished my Bratz doll. I love them, they got attitude, they're just... idk but cool looking to me, till now i prefer Bratz dolls cuz they're just cool 😎
So the main difference between the pixie realm and the normie realm is that there are giant Psilocybe subaeruginosa growing everywhere? (I guess that’s assuming that the Bratz are supposed to be the same size as meat space humans, if they are the size of Bratz dolls, the mushrooms are on the small size)  Repunzel obvy ties her hair around the leg of her chifforobe, (leaving enough slack so she can get to her toilet, because that prince is going to take all damn day climbing up so tall a tower,) then tosses the remaining hair out the window.
6:35 in case if anyone was looking 4 this
Um excuse me, i subscribed for my extra greeting, where is it 😭😭😭
when my boyfriend dylan who rode motorcycles also crashed his motorcycle
i have watched this so many times and im only now realising the bratz gnome is irish...now that is an avenges level threat
My year has been made by listening to him making fun of Kelly. It's great
lmao bratz forever diamonds is absolutely wild
im watching this right after the 2004 live action bratz movie and wow
The Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse and Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures (and the accompanying youtube channel) on Netflix are all really good.
21:43 - 21:53 had me dead💀😂😂😂😂
Bratz just always had more ✨seasoning✨ Than barbie
the crow is my favorite character
lmfaooooaoaoaoaoa ... im NOT A VIRGIN
6:54 scrolltums 👈🏼😎👈🏼
I think kelly being the worst, barbie saying balls, and dylan (just in general) are gonna become inside jokes for the channel
Ball scrawls kurtis…you could have called them ball scrwals
Laughed so hard, almost got abs
don't think i didn't see that community flag in there... E Pluribis Anus
I FOUND IT. THE BALLS CLIP. I GOT IT. IT HAS BEEN OBTAINED.
When he compares your two favorite childhood movies: 😩
Why did I say bless you when you sneezed 😂
Lesson learned: never eat food while watching Kurtis because he will disgust you.
In Disney's Tangled, she uses a sort of pully system to allow people to climb the tower so it wouldn't harm her neck/head to have them climb up. Plus her hair was SUPER long in it. Like 70 ft long
This is the hardest I’ve laughed at anything in a long time. Thanks!!
21:27
Yes… Bratz were Barbie’s competition… *brazilians* : laughs in Suzy
R.Kelly was in Kelly’s forehead.
“I’m not doing extra greeting, I’m in control here” Me: “well, so am I” *unsubscribe*
6:35 6:44
I'm so proud of Kurtis for saying "long ass hair" without laughing
When he said “here’s a little bar for ya” Why did I think the pun was gonna be bar-ratz Instead of bar-bie  help.
Your “rapunzel is bald now” song sounds exactly like they might be giants
Why do I keep coming back to this video at least once every week
I get the the crow is a cartoon, but what is that beak!? Corvid beaks don't look like that.
But... Dylan is black!
NOT THE GNOME SAYING RANDOM WORDS IN A LANGUAGE IVE BEEN FORCED TO LEARN MY WHOLE LIFE AND ALSO USING "MA" I CANT BREATHE THEY REALLY PUT THAT IN
This was a dangerous video 😭🤣
18:18 I'm Irish and I've seen a lot of racism towards Irish but, this is the funniest/weirdest yet
But why is a dude with a mullet and creep stash making a video about little girl toys? 🥴
6:35
NO I LOVED THE BARBIE RAPUNZEL. literally would would watch that movie every night before bed
Hi! im here to tell you that Jesus Christ loves you and wants you to repent and trust in Him! He gave up His glory and His throne to suffer and die for us, because we’ve all sinned against a holy and perfectly just God, but He gave His only son Jesus for you. Because we’re all heading to hell, because we’ve sinned (lied, stolen, using God’s name as a cussword, dishonoring your parents, making up your own god, adultery etc. Like c’mon you can’t tell me you haven’t lied atleast once in your life). But John 3:16: for God so loved the world that He gave His one and only begotten Son, so that everyone that believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life. Yeah you heard that right! God wants to give you everlasting life with Him, but that’s not possible when you’re still living in sin and because of that you’ll spend eternity in hell. That’s why Jesus came! So now all you have to do is repent wholeheartedly of your sins and trust in Jesus! He will give you a new heart with new desires and you will be made new and holy. But we’ll never be perfect on this earth, because we’re still in our earthly body. But we’ll be deattached to our flesh and we’ll have our focus on Jesus and God’s kingdom that’s coming! It’s coming very soon btw so please repent (confess and forsake) of your sins and trust in Jesus that He may change you and make you new and give you everlasting life in Heaven without disease, lain, suffering etc. Instead of hell and hellfire. So repent and trust in Jesus!! He’s the one that can save you and He loves you so much!! <333 Please think about this :)
Please do Barbie Princess and The Pauper. You would love the main villain and have a lot of fun with it trust me. It would be so good to react to.
monster high defeats both
me regretting why i threw away my brats doll given to me by my older niece:
Your reaction to the weasel’s sound killed me 😭😭
I only watch post facial hair Kurtis.
Is your hair permed or natural?
i love  his nails:D
Hedwig is a girl snow owl and she constantly fucks Harry Potter behind the scenes such a sad shame that they had to cut that out from the films my childhood was ruined
I used to have a Kelly doll! She had chickenpox that you could make go away by warming her up... Wish my chickenpox went away that easily 😭
In 70s/80s britain there were 2 dolls that rivaled Barbie. Pippa and Sindy. Two different doll lines. Pippa was similar to the bigger Polly Pocket with rubber clothes. Also the girls from ABBA dressed up as these dolls one time. (May have been the other way around, not sure).  Sindy however was more realistic and homey. You would get the doll and buy clothes and play sets seperatly. (I am unsure if this applied to Pippa as my mum only had one Pippa doll. It was a gift from her best friend.) In 70s/80s Britain you were either a Pippa girl or a Sindy girl. Barbie girl was not a term back then.
Didn’t watch, barbie dominates any bratz content ever made if you disagree I hate you
I like ur virgen stache
kurtis shouldve watched "barbie diaries" or as i like to call it "barbie mean girls", it's chaotic, funny and weird
barbie
Kurtis is my everything
EAHHHHHHHHHHHHH
"Rapunzel is bald now" absolutely sent me 🤣
I need Kurtis to see that one baby Bratz movie with the potato alien invasion.
You should search yourself up on tiktok and watch tiktoks abt you?
Someone stole my bratz dolls in elementary school and I'm still not over it
Also.. I have extremely long hair (22inches) and when my hair is being pulled the lower it’s pulling on my hair the more it hurts &bends my neck. So.
That weasel is def Gothel’s submissive simp.🤦🏻‍♀️😂
Harry Potter nerd here. Fun fact: Hedwig is a female 🙂 information no one asked for 😄
Barbratz
ever since i watched this video ive kept the part about hurting rapunzel by climbing on her hair in mind, and then i watched this anime adaptation of rapunzel from a series called grimm's fairy tale classics, and the rapunzel in that has her hair braided like barbies and when the witch climbs her hair shes actually holding it in a way that wouldnt just be yanking on her scalp and ive thought that its kind of ingenious to even acknowledge that
I love it ! You’re so funny 🤣🤣  I love Barbie films🤣❤️
Me writing an essay for my college English class: “why stay on topic when you can simply not”
Best kurtis line ever, "And that's weasel cum"
I think this may be my favourite YouTube video of all time
Did Kurtis victim shame drown victims lmao
the weasel sounds like hisoka's voice actor
I laughed so hard at this i woke my entire family
I was really tired and I was watching a bunch of Danny Gonzalez before this video played and I went to bed legit thinking that I was still watching Danny Gonzalez
ya hooo da ba yo
this was my first ever kurtis video I watched (apart from his minecraft videos with danny), and I've never looked back. except for when I came back to watch it again
Re: horny weasels - watch Food Fight
Actually happy I decided to watch this goofy video
Kurtis: *calls the alicorn a unicorn with horns* Me: ITS AN ALICORN!!!
it stands for very rich gay
i love you'r vid's
I was already brainwashed into considering Barbies body type as perfect by the time Bratz dolls came out but I definitely think they need to quit setting those harmful ass body standards for kids,..
Did you use the Community Asshole flag symbol?😅
Yooo Small soldiers was hands down one of my favorite movies, used to be on repeat when I got home from school 🤣
Panters
its officially been 6 months since this video came out, and i'm honestly sure that i've re-watched it over 20 times.
THIS IS LITERALLY THE NEXT "fishy, fishy, fishy, makin it stinky" IM DYING PLS 25:03
The weasel is.. INTERESTING
Barbie movies > Bratz movies
I USED TO WATCH THAT BRATZ MOVIE ALL THE TIME
The Weasel Moan lives rent free in my head forever now 🤢😉🥵
bratz fashion pixiez has the most epic music tbh
honestly really like the sound of "scrotum scroll"
Sighorny Weavel
um 😡😡😡😡 the reason penelope never flew up to save rapunzel is because she’s afraid of heights. ugh. the fact that you left this out makes me, a big barbie fan, very mad. unsubscribed.
How in the world am I just finding your channel? You're absolutely hilarious lmfaooo. Been steady cracking up watching your vids all day 😂😂
bratz is elite
bratz raised me, unlike barbie cuz i was raised 2 hate it LMAO (my parents didnt like how barbies looked the same and wore only pink LOL)
I watched the Barbie movie when I was little
ya hooo da ba yo
I audible laughed at the angry twerking scene.
I used to love both lmao I had barbies and bratz
Penelope is the one with the dumptruck.
Rapunzel was probably one of my least favorite movie out of all the Barbie ones (my favourite was The Diamond Castle) but seeing this video, I'd say at least the plotline was coherent; the writers weren't just making up things as they go, which is what they seemed to do with the Bratz movie.
can i get a ya hooo da ba yo????
Barbie swan lake or Barbie princess and the pauper are BANGER movies :/ I wish kurtis had watched one of those
Idk what I just watched and also idk why I liked it
Seeing this is interesting I NEVER liked Barbie ! Never watched a Barbie movie but when BRATZ dropped omg!!! When I say Yasmin and Sasha were my favorite I thought I would never see brown and black dolls representing me 👏🏽👏🏾❤️ …also BRATZ movie didn’t live up to my idea of bratz but the message was straight
Kurtis: *continuously addresses not being a virgin*  Danny and Drew: “virgins for lives despite the wives”
“Yea I think that’s that’s fine I think that’s what I learned as well I think that’s I think that’s fine I think what I also learned was diamonds are everywhere and you only gotta lad I learned- I didn’t learn anything.” - Kurtis Conner, March 26 2021
if you do Barbie and Bratz, I feel like it's only fair to also do the Polly Pocket movie
HeDwIg is a girl….. I’m sure someone else commented this but fyi :P
1:38 SHUT UP I SAW THIS AD ON TV
this was actually the first video where i discovered kurtis. at first, i was hesitating if i should subscribe or not, and wow, being a citizen in kurtistown is the best thing that happened to me.
"every" little girl born in the 80s or 90s probarly know what a pixie is.. First time I saw a pixie was in Lady Lovley Locks..
Okay Kurtis. All Barbie dolls have assholes but they're wearing underwear so you can't see them.
I’m the only comment left                                 Jk lol
this is my favorite video in existence and i watch it every time i cook
Could you please repeat whether you are a virgin or not?
I now understand why everyone sent me pictures of the weasel without context months ago
the kelly slander is my favorite barbie discourse
make another one im sick of watching this everyday
Wait...random 3rd variable...what about MyScene?
Damnit! I have a functioning asshole! I'll never be like Barbie 😑
YESSS
Holy shit did anyone also think the dance scene was a clear reference on the first Blade movie? The DJ and the stuff raining from the ceiling
Please watch the Bratz kids fairytale movie it is so good.
Both of all of their movies give me a very specific eerie kinda vibe but I also love them all
the motif of balls
I think I still have this movie on VHS (Barbie movie)
My Lord. Jesus. I remember watching this movie(barbie) as a kid. 😂 This unlocked one HIDDEN memory.
I have also thought about the pulling on the hair thing but apparently in some of the renditions of the story, she wraps her hair around a hook so it’s not pulling on her head I guess
I remember loving Barbie repunzel as a kid but I think it mostly had to do with the dress up game that came on the DVD. When you compare it to classics like magic of Pegasus, fairytopia, or princess and the pauper it doesn’t stack up
I opened this video and accidentally tapped at 11:50 and was like ?????????? THE WHAT??????
Please watch for Bibble in Barbie's fairytopia or mermaidia omg
I'm sorry Kurtis, but the barbie movies are better. Have you ever watched Barbie Princess and the Pauper? Barbie The Island Princess? Barbie and the Diamond Castle? Barbie and the 12 Dancing Princesses? These are quality movies.
holy shit the Bratz movie is genuinely so much better like legit would watch those dolls dance 24/7 lmao
Wait, that's what the horny weasel is from?
Barbie movies are freaking bomb. I loved them so much growing up. I liked bratz to but....i honestly don’t really remember the movies....I do remember watching the show....and I loved playing the video games.
Dancing or trancing? 17:20
what i'm hearing is that gnomes have piss kinks...
u could’ve at least watched barbie in the 12 dancing princesses
bratz fashion pixies is THE BEST bratz movie
pls make this a series 😫
Kurtis really catering to his demographic here
you can’t forget Ms. Polly Pocket
How dare I receive no extra greetings, from here on I will be rioting in the streets of Kurtistown
Kurtistown is slowly turning into a tyranny  0:28
ur a real legend bro , u r hella funny  XD
Next is monster high
You have to watch Barbie The 12 Dancing Princesses....unless you're a coward /s.
Your movie reviews always put me to my knees
BARBIE ALL THE MF WAY THOSE MOVIES STILL SLAP TO.THIS.DAY
are the barbie movies and stories based off of an actual kid playing with their dolls? cus it seems like it.
i loved kelly when i was like 7 coz i looked like her ;-; i know i have a 6 head
Is that Spyros mother ??
wait isn’t hedwig a girl?
HELP  THE CLIP OF MARTIN SCORSESE CLAPPING 😭😭
imma tell u right now bratz fashion pixies is like the worst bratz movie should have picked Genie magic
I completely forgot about the brats movie and now I realise that I have to rewatch EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM
Rave bratz music is actually kinda good ngl
"I have to get this out of the way" fjkdsfjkdsf
I love u I’m glad I came across u from cody ko- you are so god damn entertaining
ur so fucking funny I love you so much
"doth thy carpets match thy drapes?" funniest line in the video I stg
barbie movies are elite kurtis you didn’t give them a real chance watch barbie in mermaidia and tell me your life isn’t changed
Ok but monster high is superior
Music-wise Barbie isn’t touching Bratz
Bratz forever
i   like  bratz   beter
Babied wire 😭 you're a genius 😭
now you need to review an ever after high and monster high movie, then compare the two and whichever wins has an ultimate showdown with bratz
that princess and the pauper movie slapped so hard and I refuse to think otherwise
This guy’s aesthetic is an e-boy version of Weird Al Yankovic, and that’s why I’m here!
I wonder if the dragon Gothel rides is supposed to be Penelope's mom.
Dylan twerking about the two girls being kidnapped is honestly the funniest thing i've ever seen
12:34 i almost spat my chocky milk on my laptop when i heard the little sound effects.
Idk what barbie movie you picked, but there are way better ones for sure lol me and my 6 year old love Barbie "Go Team Roberts," lol just fun fact lol
nothing hits the same without the extra greeting
i love this vid bc this is probably my least favorite barbie movie against one of my favorite bratz movies..... there was no competition
Watch more Barbie rn Kurtis. I beg.
Angrily twerking and snow joke .... 💎💀
i come back to this video every few months just to feel something 🤠
On this episode of Celebrity Death Match please welcome to the ring our guest referee and event coordinator for the evening, Kuuuurtis Conneeeeerrrr! BARBIE… VERSUS… BRATZ!…   ……. Lessgetitawn!!   Hehe 😂👽😁
This has become my ultimate comfort video
Wait hedwick was a girl in Harry Potter 😅
bratz were a luxury in the 2008 recession man
Just another man pitting two bad bitches against each other 😔 I expected better kurt
Mattel me that 🤣🤣🤣😅
0:35 So youre not* really. very. good? 🤩😛😅
0:10 but are you a Virgo?
The fashion pixies movie goes so hard
I'm re-watching this rn & i just noticed something.... why does kurtboy look like nacho libre at 22:09 ???
ya hooo da by yo
You look like a Mexican coke dealer from the 70s
i love ur vids sm
2:46
Barbie as Rapunzel is one of the best films of all time and I will die on this hill
VRG could never stand for virgin, we all know that virgins could never have a very really good podcast like Kurtis does
I grew up with Barbie movies and really loved them. Didn’t ever watch bratz I have still never watched it as a 20 year old. I’ll never have the nostalgia which is the entire reason I love Barbie now
Barbie is a brat she gets fancy luxurious palaces and always gets more in the toys at least
The way in which this video actually made me laugh out loud…
Ok the pixie movie was the most dramatic movie i could remember watching in elementary wchool you unlocked a memory i forgot that i had
nice
fashion pixies is one of my fav movies ever and I’m so glad you chose it for the review
ok but is it just me or is that knome Jamaican?
Oh Kurtis I thought the letters behind you were supposed to say Virgo. Because a Virgo would totally want everyone to know they are one 😂
28:46 bless you
Scrotescroll
My Harry Potter heart is going hhh Hedwig is a female 😅
Hedwig is a woman... womens rights!!!!
Maybe VRG stands for verga, wich is Spanish for pp
someone force kurtis to watch all 39 barbie movies lol
The Barbie movies shaped my childhood
Now I really want a "Barbie Princess and the Pauper" review
I think Curtis has a crush on Stefan, I mean the way he orgasmed. He Bisexual.
This was my all time favourite bratz movie and I now must dig through all of my old dvds to find it bc this made me so nostalgic
This video should not be this funny
I know kurtis conner video comments are not where people go to read/share lore but 22:45 i think theyre referencing fairies, as described in the original peter and wendy novelization by james barrie, where he basically described fairies as absolute party animals who basically did nothing but drink booze and throw dance parties (there is a line in the original translation where a pair of drunk fairies stumble their way over the main characters "on their way home from an orgy" (which, at the time, was the equivalent of a rave)
That first movie looks like it was made in Sims 2
Oh my god Lina x Dylan ❤️❤️❤️❤️❣️❣️❣️💓💗💗💖💖💖❤️💖💘💗💓💖💖😭😭✋😌😌😍😍🥰😍😘😚
bless you
Okay only 3 mins in but, "MATTEL ME THAT" hardcore knee slapper right there
Barbie's lil Sister is tryin to b the next Jo-Jo Siwa, with that forehead.. ☝😳
The way you unlocked the memory of chalk zone...😅😂
does anyone remember "the scene dolls"?
HELP i got an add called virgin voyages while watching this
i just thought it meant virgo
Can someone make a cover of Do I wanna know by the arctic monkeys do I wanna gnome.😂
I have watched this video like 5 and every singe time I hear the word "ball" I start laughing
why does that garden gnome have the best irish accent i've ever heard in an american movie
Why is this the first time I’ve ever seen this video pop up???? I’m subscribed & this is a VERY important topic to me. Fuckin YouTube algorithm :(
oh my god that sneeze in the end sounded like my dad if his voice were a little higher
21:27 Iconic
the what barbie would look like irl clip is in front of my school and i was on my phone and looked up to the video to see where i walk everyday at school and i thought i was going insane or there was a glitch in the matrix for a second
the mom was my gay awakening
why does the weasel have human teeth
ya hooo da ba yo
Bratz dolls literally made every girl in my class start dressing sl utty as f uck and wearing thick eye makeup. We were like, 10/11.
casually drinking a glass of milk as the vid hits the 6:02 mark and i shit you not i spit milk out of my mouth all over keyboard and monitor.
This Bratz movie had a significant influence on the Sims 3 Supernatural expansion pack. Architecturally.
no cuz you shoulda watched princess and the popper
takes alot for me to really kak at a video, i really kakked at this video
9:46 it wouldn't really hurt Rapunzel's hair since she wrapped it around that pillar in the center of the window, so the pressure from all that tugging would just go to the pillar and not Rapunzel's scalp directly
Nostalgic to see barbie rapunzel again, but I was too lazy to dress my barbies so I kept them naked and had them as bath toys til they rotted. Says a lot about a child’s psyche doesn’t it
I highly recommend the youtube comedy series about Barbie and Yasmin by Sam and Mickey. It's been going on for like 10 years now and it's actually pretty canonically accurate. My favourites are the Tutti and Todd episode, Barbie's childhood, and 40 days.
Genuinely was having a crap day!! You made me laugh so much x thanks
What was this intro though? 😂😂😂😂
21:27
this video has some of the best rewatchability
no don't do that we need the extra greeting it's a trademark just like the *clap* FFFFOOOLLLKSSSS
that scene where their mum left them reminded me of kung fu panda
Hey Kurtis can u make video about Barbie diaries. That movie is horrible
This is your best video ever
5:50 6:30 10:58
you should watch barbies life in the dream house show!!
yee^2
21:27  You’re welcome.
Lmao why did the ending made me so mad, it got me (a 24 year old) heated and i dont know why.
There both great
Kurtis Makes Me Laugh 😂😂😂😂
Kurtis Conner Is So Awesome 😎
Oh my fucking god the nostalgia is unreal. That Barbie movie was one of my favourites when I was a kid, however I don’t remember Kelly being so ungodly ugly
Sad kurtis isn't a virgin. He's not cool anymore, I'm unsubscribing. /j
I promise there are better Barbie movies 😂
‘H—ny owls don’t exist’  Stolas from Helluva Boss: “Am I a joke to you?”
kurtis: can a virgin have a podcast? radio rebel: grrrrr 😡🔪
leaving a comment cause you called me a jerk, & i respect that
omfg i have the barbie movie about rapunzel and my dad would make me watch it (idk)
i think i’m in love with you
Haven't finished the video yet, if Otto doesn't make it an automatic win I'm gonna flip
this is the funniest video ive watched in a good while
please review the my scene movies
The only bratz movie i watched as a kid was Genie magic because my mom also thought it was "slutty" lol
bruh are you kidding i watch ALL classic barbie movies one by one every year. deserves at least an 8.
I personally grew up on Barbie but I prefer bratz
18:44 the immediate regret and disappointment in kurtis's face after he said that
“Ball scrolls” I legitimately can’t breathe
“I get tons of videos assing me”
This is golden
10:18 Kurtis looks unrecognisable
Nobody: The fuckin weasel: aH~
You should totally watch "barbie Prinsess charm school". It's my favorite barbie movie!!!
I wanna know who animated the Barbie movie… this shit is terrible
BRATZ literally had more poc people that didn’t look bad!
18:43 ARCTIC MONKEYS!!
Thank you Kurtis, now whenever someone mentions rapunzel the rapunzel is bald now song plays in my head and makes me laugh like a S psychopath
I was at work today, and in the mind numbing state I was in outta nowhere "Rapunzel is Bald now" popped into my head, couldn't get it out😂😂😂💀💀💀
This is the funniest video of kurtis’s I’ve ever seen and possibly the funniest YouTube video I’ve ever seen period full stop
"Scrotum scrolls" wtf omg. I had to pause the video and take a few minutes to just breathe.  The "horny weasel/Sigourney Weaver" thing 😄
i gotta know the forehead budget of that barbie movie
Having the realization that this is canonically Eric Foreman’s youtube channel if he was real and a young adult in 2021.
In the version of Rapunzel I read as a kid, she used a spiky part of her windowsill to spear her braid so it was holding the weight of the hair and the guy, saving her neck from the strain. You're welcome for this fairy tale ergonomics insight.
You didn’t mention Dylan’s LBB , the main character 😔
I was never allowed to own bratz bc my parents hated them for reasons unknown and of parent no likey than me no havey
Barbie Rapunzel is giving me Ratatoing vibes
I was the target age when Bratz were a big deal back in the day. I never had any, but back then I always viewed them as kind of the edgier version of barbie.
See I was having fun, enjoying you clowning my favorite Bratz movie but then you say the "powder" and them getting hurt from it was stupid when you forgot to put in the important part to that scene in which Brianna explains that pixie dust only hurts dark pixies. 😑
Kurtis…
I like how Kurtis focuses on the idea of firefighters using garden gnomes' piss to put out fires but not the fact that apparently garden gnomes like to get pissed on by dogs.
you HAVE to compare barbie mermaidia to bratz kids sleepover !!!
18:44 gotta love the Arctic monkeys
I didn’t know I watched the barbie movie until I watched this and realised that I used to watch these movies all the time lmao
19:38 I replayed this 20 times and laughed every time
The Bratz movie is like some random dream
Bro you can’t pick the best bratz movie and the worst barbie movie
The allow me mistress got me
i know this video is old now, but I'm here to inform anyone who doesn't know that yes, EVERY BIRD is ALWAYS EXTREMELY HORNY, ALL THE TIME, yes i am speaking from experience, no i will not elaborate
Why do the other characters in the Bratz movie look relatable and not scary but the Bratz dolls still look like malformed hookers??? Lol And the magic glasses so make me think of hallucinogens.The rave culture pushed on kids. Ick.  The angry twerk 😂🤣🤣🤣 bahaha I can't even.
Rudys got the chalk!
bankers HATE him
Both of these movies shaped my childhood thank you for this nostalgic moment
I just find it funny cuz my parents didn't let me have either because of over sexualization and unrealistic standards lol
SigHorney Weavsel
no but the bratz mom dying or disappearing in a snow storm is used in so many bratz movies. they’re all slightly different but it’s always a snowstorm for some reason edit: THE TREE PART IVE SEEN BEFORE TOO. IVE NEVER SEEN THIS BRATZ MOVIE BUT THIS IS ALWAYS WHAT HAPPENS TO THE MOMS. SNOWSTORM MOM GONE, MOM TREE
Kurtis i am missing the extra greeting :’(
This video is a master class in joke call backs. I was fucking dying the entire time.
give him to me  ✨huaaaaa✨
Well, at least Barbie didn't white-wash their male characters and change the personalities of all the other characters around.
It could also be Virgo.....Virginia. Why Virgin
She wraps her hair around another thing before they pull on it so it doesn’t hurt her head. Thank you for reading this precious information
6:00 6:33 8:34 9:51 10:13 10:56 16:06 19:32 21:36 lmao
28:46 Bless you.
That gnome is definitely from cork
honestly i want to watch bratz. never could because my family is like that
this was my favorite princess movie growing up along with barbie and the magic of the Pegasus and the 12 dancing princess. I watched this show in Hindi and could recite the whole rapunzel dialogue word to word. me and my sister would always start the dialogue and then the other would just continue along until we finished the whole movie dialogue. gothel's name was mauterma
The weasel part 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I'm dying
Kurty boy really out here choosing one of the worst Barbie movies to go against the best bratz movie😔✋
but barbie princess charm school and arbor and the diamond castle is so 💳💥💳💥💳💥
18:19 caillíní means girls in Irish.  I would know  I’m irish
I kept putting my toys in a cupard
It makes me mad that Sigourney Weaver hasn't won an Oscar yet for the Horny Weasel category. It's just proof that the Academy Awards are complete bullshit.
So no Hedwig? 📱💥
Barbie retelling is just her and friends as characters
Yay bratz
Forgot about the Barbie rapunzel movie completely.
Ya hooo da ba yo
Bratz > Barbie just saying
Hard hitting questions
Im mixed (black and white) but my entire family is white. Growing up looking very different from them was super challenging especially at school. So my mom LOVED Bratz dolls for me waaay more than barbie. She thought since fhey were more urban, younger, "hip", and different races, i could connect more. Which i did! I literally owe bratz everything. Their movies and songs about being who u are saved my little life so many times. Im 23 now, still love them. Yeah they were more makeup than barbie but im so thankful they exist because i never connected to barbie. Barbie felt fake and tbh reminded me of the girls who bullied me in school so it was upsetting getting those for christmas or birthdays until bratz came. Thats my story. Thats it. Love ya kurty boy
I eat h this to laugh because oh my god. I need more barbieVSbratz reviews. Please. My e the most recent movies?
All of the animated characters are  abhorrent.
late to the release but dude straight up looks like the weasel
Every time I watch this video I get 🎶Rapunzel is bald now🎶 stuck in my head
It looks like it says "verga" :b
I feel like this video is missing a crucial 3rd party...the MyScene girls
23:36 HELPPPP
RAPUNZEL IS BALD NOW EHIAOUFISBDU
Looooook CLOSERRRRRRRR yeaaa Yeaaaaa Waaaaay it SeeMS NOOOO NOOOOOOO TAKEE TIMEEEEE TOO REALLLLLYY SEEEEE RELLLLLLLY SEEE
Marry meme- sorry- marry me? sorry-
I swear the Barbie movie looked better when I was a kid.
The Bratz movie gave me cancer
Anyone else got Mario 64 vibes from the movies
Barbie wire 😂
anyone wait till the sneeze?
actually, selling a barbie doll with a real asshole would change the demographics of barbie customers, ;)
I just really really hate Kelly
God that barbie movie was my favorite thing when I was a kid-- always hated the weasel tho
Barbie couldn't leave with Penelope cuz the evil witch thing had the dragon dad captive
You missed a perfectly lined up hair pulling kink joke in repunzel😩 Ps: this video was the only thing to make me laugh in like 2 months. Subscribed ✅
Ngl I fucking cackled when he showed Kelly (Barbie’s sister) and he just oven flamed the bitch 😂😂😂
“Not a virgin”               -Kurtis 2021                                                                .......not a virgin .......🥺
The difference is: Barbie is a classy girl who is an Astronaut, and Bratz are prostitutes.
phuehneloii dthah aerdraehgooouuwn , thehah huuorenuooeey uewheeazzelleh , uwehvieahhll wheahtchhihh , phreanciseee , kcheangh whonee , kcheangh 2thoouwwhh, buarehhbiueyy rehpuzell , hbrityieashh rthhraaibbiethh.
Now you gotta watch Monster High
Can I super-like this video?
that bratz movie was on repeat on my portable dvd player as a kid
Kurt, brotha... You gotta stop. You have me dying every video you do. Your exaggerated skits put me in 3 comas.
When was the last time Bratz had Female Musketeers who fought in ball gowns, NEVER also Barbie had great songs like 'Connected' and 'Queen of the waves'
“Every movie needs a horny weasel”    help.
Rapunzel barbie was my fave as a child 😭❤
nothing will top the My Scene movie Jamin in Jamaica tho
KURTIS LISTENS TO ARCTIC MONKEYS? we stan
look penelope doesn't know how to fly yet when they're making that plan ok she's really shit at it it's a plotline she figures out how
Only a real barbie and Bratz scientist would use Dancing Princesses and Rocking Angels
10:06 “Does thou carpet match thy drapes?” 😂😂 SO FUNNY
18:44 DO I WANNA GNOME ABSOLUTELY SENT ME
Idk  feel like most ppl who have podcasts are virgins 🙂🙂
I literally *just come here for the skits* omfg, never cease to make me laugh😭
8:57 And the best part is that hedwig was female fjhljkwp
2:44 Jokes on you Kurtis. Girls don’t fart. They just don’t man, haven’t you learned that in school?
NO BC THE LETTERS IN THE BACK ARE MY INITIALS MIXED UP, RVG
I think I would've been way more gay if I had grown up watching bratz movies
“Dylan walks so E-boys can run their fingers through their hair“
Iconic, Repunzel was wearing a wig this whole time.   That's why it doesn't hurt
I really forgot the rendering quality of these movies. Still cackling at the scrotum scrolls possibly being found in the trash😭😂
What about my scene and Polly pockets 😭😭😭😭
Balls
I’m honestly losing my mind over the weasel, I can’t believe I loved that rapunzel movie so much as a kid
omg the barbie horse adventures videogame was THE ACTUAL SHIT!!!!!! Next best was the Barbie Beauty Boutique game.
me: "oh shitttt another kurtis vid"  me after this video: *F R A N T I C A L L Y SEARCHING YOUTUBE FOR THE BRATZ CLUB SCENE SONG*
IM SO MAD YOU DIDNT CHOOSE BRATZ ROCK ANGELZ
Are we just gonna forget about MyScene and “Jammin in Jamaica”?
You chose one of the oldest barbie movies. Why not pick one of the movies that were released around the same time as the Bratz. That's like comparing Casablanca to the Godfather..... That's probably a bad analogy because Rapunzel is wayyyy better.
"Rapunzel flew away, why didn't she just do this years ago" Bro were you even paying attention? Penelope couldn't fly over the magic wall until that moment and her dad would have been punished if Rapunzel escaped. She didn't go because she literally couldn't leave without Gothel killing Penelope's dad and even if she did, there was no way for her to get over the wall yet.
Ok so I'm actually going to explain why climbing up her hair wouldn't hurt as much as you think. If you look at the shot you can see her hair is wrapped around the post. as long as it's wrapped around enough she wouldn't really feel him tugging on the end of it because he wouldn't be pulling it from her scalp. If you have long enough hair and hold onto the top of it you can tug as hard as you want on the end and it's not going to hurt you.
This is My Scene erasure
I can’t believe I just watched a video of a 27 year old watching Barbie movies and it was hands down the funniest most entertaining video I have ever seen
U SHOULD DO MONSTER HIGH MOVIE
"Dylan twerks about it" is the funniest shit I've ever heard
ooh aLlOw Me Mistressssss UHMMPH
you have never seen one piece lol pools are scary
i first saw bratz when i was in first grade ( 2007) , my dad banned me from playing with it, buying it or even mentioning its name because it was too 'grown up' for me.
I thought self awareness jokes acknowledging bad puns couldn't be done well but holy crap it cracks me up every time Kurtis does it
Normal people can see pixies but they cant see the pixie realm/world
I watched a pirated version of the bratz pixie movie from the thumbnail when I was like 8 or 9 and that shit traumatized me, for what? Why? I don’t know. I just, It was just traumatizing to me 🙂
oh my god, there's this parody here in Brasil called " barbie maconheira" which stands for "pothead barbie" (like weed, marijuana) its AMAZINGLY FUN, i'm sorry that you can't understand and are missing this masterpiece, imma leave the link here in case you wanna try and see, but the real fun is in the slangs and the way the voice actor talks.  Link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsZk0bFoo8
I see a funny looking guy talking about Bratz and Barbie = I follow
I think in Tangled, Rapunzel actually loops her hair through things so people's weight isn't entirely on her scalp.  Just a little think I personally appreciate.
rewatching cuz it just doesnt get much better than this sometimes
do my little pony
i always skip to the Bratz Fashion Pixies segment cause it’s the funniest to me. Please review more Bratz films 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
i'm sure no one will ever notice this, but when kurtis asks if it would hurt rapunzel when these guys climb her hair, it reminded me that they covered that issue in 'Tangled', she had a bar to wrap a section of hair to hang from so it took the weight off of her head. like a pulley, sort of... barbie would have been dying, tho lol
When he said ‘we’ll start with Barbie because Barbie came on the scene first’ I thought we was going to Segway into my scene dolls….
Say what you will about that gnome, but that has to be an actual Irish person, the accent is just too good
I liked barbie but I was the perfect age for bratz coming out, they were my abs faves.
23:37 Chandler?!
10:16 doesnt she use like a hook or like something else to wrap her hair on 😭
Well this was certainly unexpeccted
so you think you can trance
As a firefighter, I can confirm that fire hydrants are in fact gnomes
A 27 year old man vs a non existent children 4:40 ... 14:26
BALLS..!!!
Those 1.3k dislikes are because we didn't get our extra greeting 🔫
No but why did you choose to watch repunzel! there were so many better options lol. well the weasel is funny so it its ok
PLEASE DO A CHRISTMAS ADDITION!!!!!
Nobody:  Barbies: I can take my shoes off and still have my feet attached to my body.  Bratz: ……. Barbies: Please take this L 💋💕 seriously that is such a weird characteristic.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Barbie my girl I was too old for bratz
Can you do more Bratz movies?🍿
why is this video so damn funny-  i’ve watched it like 3 times and it never fails to make me laugh lol.
So first time viewer here, totally just spent the last 5mins switching back between a Drew Gooden video trying to figure out they were the same guy 😆
Damn Kurtis really trying to make us think he’s not a virgin
18:44
The pastoral replace sequentially flash because business allegedly stare to a superficial slash. incompetent, left giraffe
Out of Bratz and Barbie, I'd choose Monster High lol
Feel like you"d have a hoot with Veggie Tales, Larry Boy is a cinematic masterpiece
I miss Chalkzone.
You know, Kylie Jenner looks like a lifesize Bratz doll.
Bald Barbie killed me
The James Charles apology 💀💀💀
lol I used to watch that barbie movie a lot as a kid, as well as this "Barbie in a Mermaid Tale" movie.  I totally forgot about the movie up until I saw this video, and I can't believe I didn't realize how dumb it was and how moany the weasel was
Kurtis where are the 246k holes you promised us?!?
why would she lie to her like that?
You should watch a Barbie movie with Aaron and Jo!
“All dreams have a meaning” *my dreams* : 24:45
Bratz have amazing style and are much more inclusive than barbie. The TV show and movies were much more funnier. But, barbie dolls and the movies were classic and so were the toys. But, Bratz was WAYYY ahead of it's time, the style, aesthetic, even their bodies, its all 2021. All over the internet you see that makeup, big lips, slim thick people. Barbie is basic and for kids, but Bratz is undefeated and it's relatable to older kids and even me now that I'm 21, Bratz still influences my style.
Bratz was fucking weird I loved the PS2 games as a kid though. They were fun.
I thought he looked like justin beber for a sec-
I love how you chose one of the WORST barbie movies
I’d like to end this rivalry by saying Barbie wins because brats haven’t been around for years while Barbie is decades old.
Did Kurtis just shave his head for a Barbie Rapunzel skit?
Scrolltums
bruh i know nothing about bratz except i had this bratz movie on dvd and i barely remembered the plot i just remember like the weird swamp they're in and im pretty sure that movie scared me when i was like 6
Horniest weasel award shoulda gone to Quentin Tarantino 😤😤😤
Okay, I will say it, and I'm so sorry for doing that to you but: you look like the human embodiment of the weasel. Face-wise. Which is not an insult, technically, as the weasel is handsome
I appreciate that you can cringe alongside me for your own jokes
I cannot physically watch this without the extra greeting. This is false marketing. This is a promise of good faith. I scratch your back, you fucking scratch mine. WHERE IS MY EXTRA GREETING?!?!?!?
2:53 e plurbus anus
Is it weird that I have watched this video 15 times? 😅
do you ever just .... look like what stubbing your toe feels like ??
barbie of swan lake and barbie fairytopia are by far the best barbie movies
23:38 is the greatest moment i've seen in bratz history
even more scarier then the baby robot from the super baby
When I was younger my favourite movie was a bratz movie about them getting kidnapped by potatoes and did my hair like them
I look like a tan Kelly :(
Kurtis! Hedwig is a female name. And given that the story was written by JKR, I don't think she would include a trans-owl unless said trans-owl were to hide in the boys' toilet in order to sexually harrass and kill them
Ok but have you seen the Bratz sleepover movie? That scared 7 yro me. (Still does to this DAY)
I thought that vrg stood for 'Very Really Gay' idk but it sounds right😌
Now every time I listen to Do I wanna know? By Arctic Monkeys when they go “do I wanna knowwww?” I always hear “Do I wanna gnome?” 😭
Stop with those jokes, you're not RaPUNzel!
14:01 of god that face
it's unhealthy how many times i have watched this video
THE IRISH GNOME 💀
17:03 I hear Waluigi....
No extra greeting?? I'm fucking unsubscribing /joke
i don’t know if I’ve ever laughed harder in my life
“oh allow ME mistress. *MhMmHmhhHmmMM* “
Damn Krutis you got a dumpy🥴
Can you do W.I.T.C.H. vs winx club?
I think Kurtis might actually enjoy watching Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse. My friend in college made me watch it and we actually had a great time lmao
What an outrage! Barbie is so much better! Reconsider your decision right now mister! >:(
I keep rewatching this video, it's truly my favorite Kurtis video
I died at 3:04
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE ANGRY TWERKING GIRL????? I CAN'T BREATHE
Yo wtf is up with that Weasel??????
The Bratz movies are on a whole nother level and I am so here for it
you look like a soft murderface from metalocolypse
as someone who loves e girl and y2k fashion, i still love bratz as a 21 year old
NOT THE DRAPES JOKE
i remember being absolutely obsessed with the brats girls hair
I want the last thing hear to be Brabie saying "balls" with that echo lol
Bestie you let balls reverb a little too long.
The barbie movies were the shit but Bratz dolls were way cooler
this may be your funniest video i cried from laughing omg
Mattel me that.  Idk why I lost my shit I was laughing too hard at that joke.
he’s a virginia
DYLAN DOING THE WAP HAHHA

🍥🌸Barbied Wire 🌸🍥
11:58 i didn’t know al from al’s toy barn was the king
... I was so distracted because he didn't do the extra greeting albeit on purpose but still 😟😢💔
i used to watch rupunzal all the time growing up, cant beleive you would slander her
dislike cos no extra greetings 😐
kurtis if you watched the movie you'd know half the entire plot was penelope COULDN'T fly over the magic barrier ://// i have to unstan
I ship Lena and Cymbelline from the two seconds I just saw of them looking at each other.
that barbie movie was my favorite when i was little bro
i want to watch you make fun of the live action bratz movie PLS
Barbie movie had a better storyline, bratz movie seemed all over the place
Lmaoo the moaning weasel part cracked me up  6:34
Bratz fashion pixiez was my entire childhood. Yes I watched hundreds of barbie movies as a child. But nothing outdid fashion pixiez
Ya hooo da ba yo
Oh man this is some nostalgia heroin right here. The Barbie fairy tale movies are good, but the best one was Magic of Pegasus.
I wish you could watch this Rapunzel movie dubbed in Portuguese. The weasel has some iconic lines and sounds even weirder. 10/10
i enjoyed barbie and bratz but i think i played with bratz more. when i got older monster high was definitely my thing, i have a small collection of them. ill always hate disney descendants for running monster high and ever after high off the shelves. now since theyre gone i go for barbie or wild hearts crew dolls, rainbow high and lol dolls are super ugly
As a guy who has long dark hear and constantly wears black, the image of the evil pixies is fucking metal
"doth thou carpets match thy drapes?" I JUST GOT IT. MY LIKE IDFK 3RD TIME WATCHING THIS? jeez
I left a comment :(
I used to have that barbie movie on dvd....
THOSE👏🏾ARE👏🏾ALICORNS👏🏾😤
6:33 you're welcome
10:11 best part of this video
Basically barbie rules
This was so funny I've cried with laughter the whole episode. Thank you so much
As someone who recently broke her toe by stubbing it, I can confirm that it feels the way Kelly looks.
If you want more info on Barbie and other popular toys check out the toys that made us on Netflix
this. this video is my comfort video, for no reason.
MORE.
barbie supremacy
:)
Fun fact, in case you were wondering, its COMPLETELY PLAUSIBLE for a prince to climb Rapunzels hair. In Tangled, Rapunzel throws her hair over this little hook. That's what's called a pulley. The basic premise is that if you throw a rope around...pretty much anything (although generally a wheel or hook) it will loosen the pressure on the rope. The more wheels/hooks you use, the less pressure there is. So yeah, a prince could totally climb Rapunzels hair.
4:57 LMFAO  5:13 BAHAH
please watch 12 dancing princesses
why we pinning girls against girls rn     K   U   R   T    I    S
If there isn’t an extra greeting what’s the point of being subscribed?
You forgot about Penelope's daddy issues 😡     This is meant as a joke I promise, I loved this video cause I grew up with the barbie movie
this is literally my favorite video i rewatch it like every day
I couldn't hear this video for a bit while I had my fan on while I was cooking and I came back around the 24:56 mark and boy oh boy was I confused
Can you please react to another Barbie vs bratz lmao
i’ve watched this video too many times but i cannot help it <3 truly would do anything for a part 2 rematch
The Bratz rave music slaps so hard holy shit
Any men here     This guys edits are funny as fuck
you could clip so much out of context shit out of this video its hilarious
i made ramen for the break. it was nice.
Oh wow. Me and my cousin did the same thing whilst watching Small Soldiers XD
It's ironic cause every model nowadays look like bratz dolls. Is that offensive I hope not... Anyway.. Hi click the like button and you'll get an extra greeting 👍👍 P.s. when did Barbie become friends with the dragon Spyro?!?!
do i wanna gnome ..... i hadnt laughed that hard since 97
I'm freaked out by the dragons hands for some reason
Bro- wth- I want my extra greeting! I didn’t subscribe for this discrimination 😡 I’m unsubbing 😩
Era para que vea la princesa y la plebeya :( la mejor película de Barbie en el mundo
But why pick Barbie as Rapunzel when Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper is right there being a master piece
You should do monster high next
ya hooo da ba yo
They obviously thought about the physics of rapunzels hair when they climbed up, you can see she coiled it around a pillar. DUH!
I watched this movie with my friends in college, and I still have a clip of that weasel on my phone. It was the most disturbing thing we've ever heard 😂😂
OKAY but bratz rock angels ROCKED MY VERY SOUL 😭💖
24:05 26:18 dilf😩
I need to thank my algorithm for putting this on my page because your commentary is so damn funny.It was an instant subscribe
Anyone else feel like the gnomes were probably supposed to be leprechauns but they changed it to garden gnomes at the last minute??
this is my comfort video
You gotta watch one more Bratz movie please. Watch the slumber party one that gave so many kids nightmares.
He picked the worst Bratz movie though. There’s better ones.
i was trying to watch this video while painting my nails, but it didn't work very well because i kept laughing
Sounds like something a virgin would say 🤔
Kurtis Conner hates Mondays = Garfield.
I have noticed several videos without an extra greeting. Unless you don't do them EVER now
I'd recommend Barbie as Princess and the Pauper though, you would have loved Preminger.
6:35      B A L L S         (I had to make a timestamp)
the chase scene without music 😂
I was def a Bratz girl. I was obsessed (and tbh, I’m still obsessed) with all of their movies, I had the bed sheets, the little moon chair, basically every collection, clothes, accessories… Now Barbie, I still liked but it was never to the extent that I did Bratz. I will say though, Island Princess, Princess and The Pauper, Nutcracker and Swan Lake were the superior Barbie flicks.
Where's my extra greeting.
Not gonna lie, one of my favorite pastimes is twerking angrily and aggressively.
this whole video is just him talking me through my entire childhood
This is my favourite video in the world can’t stop watching it. Make more!!!
The haaaaaaair Stan queen💃🏻🕺🏼
I use to watch that brats movie all the time it feels like a fever dream
I thought it was Chelsea not Kelly, but maybe they switched it up?
this is my third time rewatching this vid…
OMG THIS VIDEO IS SO BLOODY ICONIC
The buildup to the "No Hedwig" f*cking got me
Ya hooo da ba yo
I'm tired, but yeah imma just watch this
Um kurtis if you watched the barbie Pegasus movie you would know those are Pegasus and not unicorns
im surprised that bratz fairy movie was actually a thing. i thought all the bratz movies I watched were fever dreams
oh, hallow me mistress, MMMMHHHHH!
i was getting ready for you to say quentin tarantino was the horniest weasel but was severely let down
Didn’t nutcracker come before rapunzel?
Him saying Barbie is worse is just waking up an entire fandom
Quentin Tarantino should’ve won the horniest weasel award
Lmfao, i can't stop thinking about how "vrg" it's the way some people abbreviate the word "v3rga" which is the spanish translation for "c0ck" and some people in mexico use that abbreviation to not sound so obscene, i personally hate the word that's why i put a 3 instead of an e lol but it's kinda funny to think about Kurtis using that word
I felt there were a lot of sexual jokes, maybe just me tho
Barbie and the 12 dancing princesses is to this day one of the most influential pieces of media to my life
9:30 I'm pretty sure they show her hair wrapped around the pillar bit of the window. Which is a hilarious detail that they really didn't need to add. 9:47 IIRC Human hair is similar in strength to copper wire of the same diameter. Hair dressers regularly get bits of hair sticking in their hands/fingers
kurtis brush ur moustache please for the love of god
this video is so good.
Bro I watch every brats movie with my sister when we were little kids and I bought a lot of the dolls! Lol
Idk why but the Barbie Rapunzel movie in Spanish is way less cringe than the English version
BRO AHAHAHAHSHAHAHAH THE WAY KELLY FELL IN THE HOLE- LMAOOOO
Actually Mattel won. That's why Bratz was discontinued.
Okay, the dude who voiced the weasel was on some hardcore Drugs while he was hormny
I cannot believe Kurtis didn’t pick The Princess and the Pauper. What the fuck
Ya know... both of those are losers. The true winners are the Monster Highs
Ok, but some of the Barbie movies high key slap. For example: Swan Lake, Nutcracker, and The Princess and the Pauper. I genuinely love them, and so does the rest of my family. We just quote them or sing the songs (these are musicals) and it's great. Probably because the villains are voiced by well known actors.
Just came to say bratz. 👍
kurtis not watching bratz rock angelz and consequently not getting to see cameron laser eye glare a mans head for talking to chloe is a tragedy
the best classic barbie film is either swan lake or princess and the pauper so you gave her a bad start
6:44
im losing my mind over scrotum scrolls it sounds like something from a boujie cafe
Gotta do this with more Barbie and Bratz movies. Mainly because you didn't watch the best Bratz movie for this and that needs to happen. Bratz Rock Angels, man. It's hype stuff
i rlly hope he does a review of barbie princess and the pauper (the best barbie movie)
The amount of times I watched these movies as a kid. I probably annoyed my parents so much
The clap at the beginning of Kurtis' video is the same as the Midsommar mushroom clap and I am  just shooketh and immediately come to attention
ya hooo da ba yo
why does the rabbit look like Christopher Walken
"this was your one chance to make kelly not look like what stubbing your toe feels like" PLEASWE KURTIS I CANNOT
ya hooo ba da yo
He should have watched 12 dancing princesses he choose the wrong barbie movie
I fucking LIVED for the Barbie rapunzel movie as a kid. The early Barbie movies were scored by the National Philharmonic or London Symphony orchestra or somethin, so all the orchestral backing is obscenely good. But boy howdy the gay coded villains. Preminger is an icon for the ages tbh I strive to have his flair and confidence
The heavenly heavy hellish orchestra chemically record because receipt byerly dust through a axiomatic neck. standing, homeless hyena
Nice sneez 🤩🙏✨
wait so... when the garden gnome was first chasing the Bratz... you're telling me they saw a fire hydrant chasing them? yeah, I would've ran too
To think I watched this brats movie on repeat as a kid, god forgive me 🤣😶
TESTISCROLES
you can tie your hair to a pole before throwing it out of the tower. It wouldn't really hurt at that point.
none of them boo, long live to the barbz!
Drew must've lent Kurtis his kim possible wig for the rapunzel segment
Doth thy carpet match thy drapes? 😭😭
You need to watch the bratz super hero movie… I want to say why but it would just ruin it, let’s just say it’s wild. If y’all know what I’m talking about you know.
Okay but Barbie as repunzel is the best Barbie movie ever made period & yes Kelly’s annoying as fuck
"do i wanna gnome" is exactly the type of shit i love about ur videos
😂😂😂💀💀💀
SCROTUM SCROLLLLSSS
kurtis u forgot to mention that penelope is scared of flying
i love the kelly slander
theres better movies than the rapunzel one, i suggest watching barbie in a mermaids tale, its a really good movie with a cool plot (and no kelly i think)
The fact that her hair is wrapped around that pillar kind of keeps it from pulling on the main point on her head
that girl angrily twerking was easily my favorite part LOL
ya hooo da ba do
i watched this while feverish and i can't tell if im losing it or if the video is really just Like That
monster high erasure
Barbie movies is a broad term since theres like 100 and every one of them is make in a different year
the Arctic monkeys joke was elite ngl
Barbie rapunzel and Barbie nutcracker were my two favorite movies as a kid. But my cousin loved Bratz movies and i remember getting into heated arguments with her when we were like 6 lmao
god im losing it over the reference to the e boy hand thing
back then when i watched this for the first time as a kid, i asked myself “can’t rapunzel just glue her hair back?” since her hair looks thick and solid i thought you can glue it back like a porcelain vase. i couldn’t sleep at night thinking about that possibility. ah, my innocent children mind.
i think we all know monster high movies are superior to all
Why would anyone think he is a virgin? he's a gamer chad!
Please, for the love of God. DON'T GO BALD
21:40 I HAVE to make a timestamp for this. OH MY GOD ITS SO FUCKING FUNNY
Swan Lake & Rock Angelz were fire storylines!
I'm dying🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
They got Gnomed
24:05 i said that at the same time as u and i’m fearing for my life
no joke bratz: fashion pixies is my fav movie from my childhood besides barbie: princess and the pauper. kinda cool how i’ve always watched and loved both series equally
I've been going back to 6:33 for the past hour and I can't stop
my mother took away my brats dolls because she said they looked and dressed like whores.
I adore that its the Greendale flag he added in
I diagnose Kurtis with ADHD
I would like to take this as an opportunity to apologize to all the Barbies that uhhh... I hope you guys would be able to forgive me. I was just a kid back then.
That brats movie is the most fever dream type of fever dream I’ve ever experienced
Thanks for giving me barbie movie ptsd flashbacks
Kurtis doesn't know the lore that Dylan is actually black/biracial
Mattel me that 😂😂🏃🏾‍♀️
bratz will always be superior
Anyone else notice how sharp his bottom K9s are?
Had to like and subscribe for the angry twerk
Never forgiving Mattel for letting go of the creator of Monster High
6:35
11:01
Most of the Barbie movies were really good. Prefer the Bratz though
PLEASE O PLEASE DO ROCK ANGELZ
Barbies and bratz are both iconic in their own way and it’s important that both fandoms respect eachother❤️ like im personally a Barbie girl since i was fetus in the 2000s and personally think its the best but i still respect bratz fans both fandoms are iconic lol (why did this turn into a ted talk lol)
The baby bratz are so cute
The james charles womp womp womp in the back when he’s holding himself accountable
I remember watching the Barbie rupunzel move so many times as a kid and now I wonder why
The Pixie King dad tho 🥵😩🔥
Kurtis: ..Do owls get horni?" Helluva Boss fans: vietnam flashbacks intensifies
barbie rapunzel was my childhood
Kurtis: could a virgin have a pod cast??!?  …well I mean Seth rogan did it 😐
This is so far the FUNNIEST one you have done Kurtis, my God, this was a masterpiece in comedy
wtf was that sneeze at the end
Thanks so much for your vids, man. I haven’t been feeling the greatest this week but I’ve been going through some of your vids these past couple days after subscribing. Been laughing my ass off and feeling much better.
Me: I would never know what to post on YouTube. All my ideas are shit. This guy: BARBIE VS BRATZ ! World: Almost 3 millions views in about 2 months
American girl dolls: umm... what am I? A ROACH?!?
I religiously watched those Barbie movies as a kid they slap so hard 💀I’ve seen rapunzel so many times I’m pretty sure we have it on dvd to this day
that moment when your name is dylan
virgin podcast for life
6:35 dont mind me just putting this timestamp here
barbie and bratz dont compare to Monster High dolls though and their movies
Listen i love barbie, i have all the movies, but if bratz doesn’t win this ill have to review my legal options
pls review the live action bratz movie it goes so hard 😭❤️
i need a video of monster high now pls
Ngl I didn't understand the plot of the Bratz movie at all.
The animals in that Barbie video all look a lot better than the humans. At that point, why didn't they just make a furry video (and a toy line too)? Kids love animals.
you're fully planning on suddenly up and tranforming into freddie mercury aren't you
Damn, chose one of the earlier Barbie movies
I hated Bratz as a kid because I was bullied by all the girls who liked Bratz dolls :(
I never owned bratz dolls growing up, only barbie dolls But my oldest brother did Idk why he liked them, tbh I didn't really like barbie dolls either theyre just what my mom got me all the time. I liked Monster High dolls more but when they came out I was 9, so I guess I remember them more than the others
I feel as though Kurtis has been personally wronged by a Kelly in a past lifetime..
with the bratz v barbie realistic proportions thing, the difference is that barbie has unrealistic proportions on a mostly regular shaped body, while bratz go full cartoon. as a doll collector i do not and never have valued realistic proportions, and tbh prefer cartoon proportions. theyre more fun and its fun to go crazy. humans already look like humans, i dont want just a small human. its gotta look interesting, if i want to see a small human ill just look at someone from far away. also dolls are an art form, just as most things are. realistic sculpting is impressive, but its not fun for dress up or styling or looking at because you do all those things on REGULAR humans already! and with irl body expectations, its like using ferb from phineas and ferb as goals. you can visibly see that no human can ever physically look like that without doing math to figure out how he would look if he was real. barbie looks real enough you dont understand that its impossible to look like that unless you think real hard about it
My farting Barbie hasn't arrived yet. Very dissatisfied 😕😤
No extra greeting, huh? Again? Shaping up to be just another mayor who campaigned on lies & unfulfilled promises. smh
Not Kurtis watching the bad barbie movie. You have to watch Swan Lake or Twelve Dancing Princesses at least T^T
Okay I noticed 2 things he got wrong about Barbie Rapunzel: first of all, it is established that the dragon could not fly high and her getting that ability was a part of the climax of the movie. Secondly, Gothel didn't put that spell on Rapunzel before because she did not believe her to be a liar before that night. While we know that Rapunzel was not lying, she doesn't and we don't know if there is a spell to trap people regardless of whether they lie or not.  I take my Barbie lore very seriously because that's what adults do.
to be fair im pretty sure the dance thing isnt extremely far off from actual fae lore? something about being taken to a fairy ball where youll eventually die because humans have stamina that the fae just. dont. so ,,,, yeah. also love dylan just. existing. for the entire movie. homie does nothing but be there and i love that for him
*kurtis just slandering kelly*   *me losing my shit*
ya hooo da ba yo
I kept thinking even though  I WATCH VERY REALLY GOOD for some reason I kept thinking the vrg meant VIRGO ♍
I wish you could do more of this lol, I keep rewatching this
Bruh you gotta watch all the bardie movies and all the bratts movies to judge!
i come back to watch this video weekly. thank you kurtis
HE DIDNT FORGET THE EXTRA GREETING, BUT HE DID FORGET THE FOLKS👏
kurtis! you should’ve watched bratz rock angelz!
THE GNOME PISSING ON THE FIRE HAS ME PISSING 😭
This video could be 28:50 of you and that girl angry twerking and would be almost just as good
“Mattel me that”
im surprised that kurtis didnt know that they made a live action Bratz movie with real people
I can't believe you'd watch a Bratz movie about pixies and NOT watch Barbie A Fairy Secret. They're BOTH about fairies (and A Fairy Secret is better than Rapunzel dont @ me)
"So no Head-wig?" *smashes phone*
" are you hard? He's so hard right now!"
Bratz reign supreme, and Kurtis, a man of taste and class, gave them their rightful win.
penelope was afraid of heights that's why she never flew over the wall! it was a whole plot point
cancel???
Canada actually has the weirdest tv shows.. chalk show?  Was that a kid show? Or am I lost in translation..
3:08 bratz isn’t more inclusive that was just a white girl in different wigs
idk but i thought that the old lady was gonna say "I stole her cause I was in love with her", the weasel would have made more sense if that was the plot twist
There is no bigger flex than hiring the London Symphony Orchestra and just not using it.
honestly as a now adult who grew up with both, bratz were far better. Bratz were more group/friend centered, as well as, more teenage like and fashion "fordward???"... the movies were also way more interesting!
Pretty sure the bratz movie was About drugs or some shit
I was a huge fan of the Barbie movies when I was younger. I will always choose Barbie just because of that.
Those Gnomes are speaking Gnonense
Why has that damn gnome got the best Irish accent I’ve heard in an American movie
I love the video but, I cannot like the video due to the lack of extra greeting. I hope you can understand
19:39
This is absolute proof that I will listen to Kurtis talk about anything.
The Matrix scene with the agents saying "Hey, get over here" got me dead!
Haven't watched it it but when he said bratz movies, i remembered a bratz movie i saw when i was younger and it scared me shitless. I dont know why i just couldn't continue watching it. ummm it was the one where there is a muzzle on a dog because it's super smart but kind've psychotic. I was really young so i was just a blank creepy wide eyed face after words.  And now in the future I have psychotic tendencies! THANK YOU BRATZ😀
my 30 min just passed so quickly
21:58 BRUHHDCG I CHOKED ON MY RICE
2:55 isnt that community’s flag? Lmao
Scrote scrolls
"I think I might just....hate children"-Kurtis
what bout the live action bratz
Barbie: * is the most popular doll in the world * Bratz: "Girl, you ain't gonna last like that. Let us show y'all a REAL doll, y'hear?" Bratz: * exists * Barbie: * sues Bratz * Bratz: * wins the case * Barbie: * weasel noises * Bratz: * twerks furiously *
Try watching barbie fairy secret so you get to see how more current barbie films are
😂😂😂💀💀💀
Honestly the Monster High films are the best out of this genre
Do I wanna gnome??🤣🤣
:'(
Barbie movies were my childhood man, the princess and the pauper was the best lmao. I haven’t seen it in like 10 years but I know most of the songs still
The angry twerking xD looks like something my 4yo would do. Which is both amusing and scary
learned helplessness moment
Damn your mustache. I got KFC and I don't think ill eat it anymore
Ya hooo da ba yo ?
kurtis confirming that he’s not a virgin made me uncomfy for some reason. i guess i forget that other people have sex or have “the anatomy” to do so. anyone else or just me? i think i just picture everyone as having a ken-like body. i dunno 🤷🏼‍♀️
The “balls” echoing HAS ME DEAAAD
I demand a part 2
barbie as rapunzel goes hard honestly. loved that movie
i am betrayed. where is the extra greeting, kurtis. you can't just not give me the extra greeting, it's the only consistency i have in life. you have ruined me. disliked, unsubsribed, and reported. i am livid.
I love watching the movies that formed your childhood and acknowledging how objectively fuckin terrible they are
dont call me a jerk its not nice :(
Kurtis didn’t watch any of the gay barbie movies, and I am personally offended  (Not me liking the Bratz franchize more)
this is definitely on the list of Kurtis Conner Comfort Videos
Oh good, so Chalk Zone wasn't just a weird fever dream from my childhood
I'm jealous of your hair, also I think it's hilarious that when Stefan grabs Rapunzel Barbie, his hands touch when he wraps them around her waist lol
Bratz fairy tales used to be my all time favorite
WATCH PRINCESS PAUPER
Otto is literally the bast part of the movie tho!
please watch barbie diaries
god i wish i could like this twice
how dare he refer to THE bratz as "breanna's friends".... those are the girls with the passion for fashion
I'm going to have to be a nerd/geek for a moment and supply some fantasy logic. Gothel waiting to cast the crazy powerful spell is most likely due to the fact that crazy powerful spells have crazy expensive costs. I've been playing Dungeons & Dragons and other home brew roleplaying games for over 16 years, and I have only played a spell caster maybe 3 times. That's because spells are stupid expensive, have ridiculous requirements (like needing specific sized hunks of metal, or doing weird hand waving shenanigans, etc.), and usually require the caster to focus on maintaining the spell constantly. The caster has to forego casting any other spells to maintain such powerful spells, unless you are some max level caster with multi-casting abilities. This means, in traditional fantasy RPG logic, Gothel has to focus on maintaining that barrier spell, sacrificing her ability to cast other spells without canceling the barrier spell first. Go ahead and correct/mock me in response, I'm just saying that the Barbie movie kind of did something correct there. Just a moment of fantasy correctness amongst a garbage fire of inconsistencies though... From a fantasy view, I feel that the Bratz movie is more unique. It is also full of inconsistencies, but most fantasy movies for children are that way.
*I rarely cry when laughing but the angry twerking part made me. Amazing job.*
I loved chalk zone
can't believe there wasn't a single joke about the pixies band in thid entire video. kurtis fell off fr
I love that Barbie finally gave us that Rapunzel/Spyro crossover we’ve all been waiting for.
Kurtis looks more and more like John Oates from Hall & Oates everyday in these videos.
I know you came back for this 6:34 b a l l s
E
That's because you didnt heard the brazilian version of the weasel
as someone who recently, quite literally, watched EVERY barbie movie, rapunzel actually scored pretty low on our scoring system, which we call the barbometer. should have watched the princess and the pauper or princess charm school smh
6:16
ya hooo da ba yo
this is the conversation we needed
2:43 Excuse me how do you know that
I watched that barbie film so many times when I was younger and I completely had forgotten about it thanks for reminding me of the absolute quality
Yo when I was younger and my friends mom got me a bratz doll with my skin tone I was so happy! but I loved the Barbie movies more hmmmm
When I had long hair. There was a little kid who was obsessed with my braids and would hang on them. It didn't hurt as much as one might thing. To be fair she wasn't a grown man.
I use to love barbies, now I have 15 collectible barbies, it was her world tour thing idk
"scrotum scrolls" sent me FLYING 😭☠️😂
OK but the Pixie King kinda bad tho😳 AWOOGA AWOOGA😳😖😰
I always look at bratz movies like maxis sims with alpha hair
You look just like my dad if he found a time machine and was able to be younger and gay like I know he is
2:53 E Pluribus Anus, my dude
“so no headwig😡??”
do ever after vs monster high
the mustache has got to go
you GOTTA watch  barbie "myscene" jammin in jamacia. cinematic masterpiece. the opening song is actually a fucking bop but the plot?????? the animation??????? insane.
Damn no one is talking about that weasel-
That was the most nostalgic thing I’ve experience especially the music less chase seen. Barbie princess was the fucking bomb as a kid.  My brain is wondering if gnomes are always high on shrooms because there are always mushrooms associated with gnomes
Who's gonna tell him about the bratz baby alien movie (or was that just my childhood fever dream😂)
you had to pick my least favourite barbie movie to review. you should have done the barbie princess and the swan. WTF KURTIS!
Imagining a dog pissing on a little gnome since they’re fire hydrants is all I could think about when he brought that up.
Excuse you. Hedwig is a girl. ✋
Barbies Princess and the Pauper is hilarious... Review that 🤣
I can't believe he didn't choose Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper instead, that one is fucking great
Please do “hot wheels   highway 35 world tour” review
ya hoo da ba yoo .
The Bratz that I remember were not like that and I'm happy for it. The Bratz that I watched as a kid were cool,  the history was about  a group of girls that like fashion and were trying to get a place on it,  and the quality was way better than that.  For barbie...... The new series on Disney Channel that is ON now a days is pretty cool
Seeing kurtis so nonchalant about Barbie as Repunzel is a world-shattering reality check for me cuz I WORSHIPPED that movie when I was small. I’m pretty sure I watched that transformation scene when she paints her costumes to life at least 50 times lol
your edits are so good lmao
Yo this video brought back repressed memories of the Barbie movie for me. I didn’t even know I ever watched it. Wtf man.
The extra greeting is the reason I subscribed sleep with one eye open 😉 this is a threat
idk why i havent watched kurtis until now, but holy fuck he is hilarious
It’s either you where a barbie or a bratz girl That or a monster high or ever after high
here you guys go again pitting 2 bad bitches against each other :/
Well, now I HAVE to unsub since I didn't get my extra greeting. That's right Kurtis, WE have the power. You were never in control. Bakaaaaaaa
All piexies are evil, don't joke with pixies
I thought they were gonna say trans, no transfer, what a disappointintmentkoenfiosnñfkneiuk I have dyslexia and that word is too much
Bratz and Polly are my favourite dolls, they used to date each other, as a good straight nonbinary person will do :)
The disrespect on Kelly’s name rn is ASTRONOMICAL
im not even 5 mins in and there is already so much you discussed about
i had a crush on archer from small soldiers
Dude I hate it when a crow steals my backpack.  Happens at least once a week.
Honestly I loved that movie growing up and wish I could've owned both barbie and Bratz lol
You picked the two best movies from each franchise 😂
this is my 4th time watching... i still don't get the bratz movie... at all
The amount of happiness and nostalgia I got from that Barbie movie, I used to love that movie so much.
Okay, what is the giant gnome gonna do when he catches me exactly? please, if it's so obvious someone HAS to tell me because hes getting close
now do "ever after high vs monster high." now.
Do i wanna gnome 😔
2:46 MATTEL ME THAT
Kurtis dont be too hard on yourself i laughed so hard to the * do i wanna gnome * chef’s kiss
you know if we actually think about it logically it wouldn't actually hurt Rapunzel too bad to have someone climb up her hair seeing as she's been living with pounds and pounds of hair her entire life her scalp and probably grown to be pretty strong and her neck was able to withstand a lot of weight
21:26
Give him to me! *_aAuGh~_*
I SUSCRIBED FOR AN EXTRA GREETING; I WANT MY EXTRA GREETING!!!
very really good at being a virgin hhhmmm
bratz is the most boring dolls, yeah they look better than barbie dolls but like the movies are so overrated and boring.  I think it goes  Looks:  1. Monster High 2. Bratz 3. Barbie  Movies:  1. Barbie 2. Monster High 3. Bratz  honestly barbie and monster high are so much better than bratz
get a load of this cucumber sandwich,  doesn’t know what an alicorn is
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse is absolutely the best piece of television I have ever watched. It is simply impossible to beat. I personally prefer Bratz Dolls but they will never make anything as good as Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse.
Barbie would’ve been the winner if you watched The princess and the pauper ngl
I clearly liked and watched this video but I do not remember this existing at all
this video is the reason i still live.THE WHITE PEOPLE DANCING ON THE BRATZ IS KILLING ME PLS
Weasel is giving hisoka
24:02 I like how this one SpongeBob joke caused an idle SpongeBob game ad to appear for me
I think you should watch bratz super babies because there's alien potatoes
21:40
hedwigs a girl my dude
Please do a reaction to bratz rock angels and Barbie swan lake
I had the same hair-complaint when I was younger but then I realized - physics! She always wraps her hair around a hook or a pillar or something. That's why it doesn't hurt.
the bratz fashion pixies movie walked so that twilight fairygrunge girls could run
just so you know, Owls do in fact get aggresively horny. Its actually one of the reasons (amongst many) theyre discouraged from being a pet. When theyre in heat theyll hoot incessantly calling out for a mate and if they get no response theyll generally get really mad and start ripping random shit to shreds with their talons.
bratz and monster high fans are they only ppl with fashion sense. imo
I loved that bratz movie when I was a kid, I was kinda scared of it tho😅😂
4:58
I used to force my mum to sing me the birthday song from the Barbie and the 12 dancing princesses every year until I was like 7
bro why are gnomes in so many brats films I swear they are in all of them
I've watched that bratz movie like 20 times
that horny weasel thooo....
You’re definitely the funniest dude of all three.
okay virgin.
This video is fkin hilarious. So punny
So sad that this is the end of the extra greeting 😢
The way I saw them in the castle during rapunzel and thought “these mfs ain’t wearing masks”
Purrr Bratz for life XD
“unicorns with wings” THE DISRESPECT 😤THEYRE CALLED PEGASUS’S KURTIS 😡
I just want rapunzel to get fricken scalped
Ball-scrolls is my new favorite word
Feels nice to look back at these movies ngl
every night i wake up in a cold sweat, screaming, and it's all because of that "do i wanna gnome" clip (18:42)
he picked the worsr movies
HEY  SUBBED GIMME MY GREATING NOW! ILL SCREAM!
U forgot Polly pocket.. I loved chewing the clothes
23:36 BHAHAHAJSHS
6:35 on replay
We all know bratz had the better dolls lmao the quality was 10x better and they were way more fashionable
this is one of the best videos he’s ever made. periodt.
vrgo
excuse me kurtis you live in canada why is the sweepstakes for americans
26:32
YA HOOO DA BA YOOO
I vividly remember this game that came on the Barbie as Repunzel DVD where you got to decorate her hair and I played the hell out of it
Imagine if dylan just pulls a gun out and just shoots the shit out of the crow
Whenever I get really depressed I watch this video because I physically cannot watch this video without uncontrollably laughing
Holy fricken shit man! I watched that Bratz pixies movie so much, like- constantly. I used to play with bratz and transformers as a boy alot.
why does kurtis look like an alternate dimension oompaville?
You’ve gotta do Monster High!!!
Kurtis angrily twerking has no right to be that funny
THE SNEEZEEEEEE 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The weasel is basically Barbie version of Mort from Madagascar
“Scrotum scrolls”….scrolltums
the James Charles reference was quite the surprise
BTW there was a repunzel game and barbie when I was younger and I had both and if you pulled on her hair it would grow longer. Lol I remember this movie vividly lol
Dude don't forget there was a couple of bratz games
I can't believe that Kurtis is ruining my "innocence" in my childhood. Ooooppffft...Good ol times with a blonde doll who can be literally anything I guess.
Fun fact: the voice actor for Otto (the weasel) is the same guy who plays Goku in the English dub of dragon ball z
even when I was 5, I knew that party was the shit
“Give Em to me-                     MmMmHhHh!”
Everyone playing with Barbies and Bratz dolls  Me with Monster High dolls 😎
Kurtis misgendering Hedwig by calling her a guy is sending me. 💀
Is this the guy from the I feel like fucking something tik tok
you really cant compare the single best bratz movie to an average barbie movie, you shouldve watched barbie swan lake or barbie and the 12 dancing princesses to make it even
I swear you are the funniest person I’ve ever seen
Scrotum scrolls V: Skyrim
Do I wanna gnome omg i just unlocked a trauma I will never ear "know"
the weasel must be voiced by the guy who voiced Hisoka in HxH🤣
now here we are asking the important questions
You picked the wrong barbie to watch
fun fact, ancient people used to send photos to their wives or whatever of an outline of their pp instead of a photo
part 2… thanks
I’m so glad this came into my recommended
i thought the signage stood for virgo without the vowels
no cap seen like all the bratz movies and barbie movies, fucking bratz is FIRE 😪
So much nostalgia in this video 😂
When Kurtis has a moustache, he looks like his own creepy uncle😭😂
fun fact: the voice actor for barbie also voiced sango, a demon slayer whose little brother killed much of their village while possessed, in the english dub of inuyasha. both aired/released during the early/mid-2000s. this will never leave my mind
pretty sure the owl hoot was a great horned owl and hedwig was a snowy owl 😤🖐 what’s up with the owl inaccuracies in this Barbie/Bratz video
Hey everyone random question, Im trying to learn Spanish and Im looking for a few Spanish speaking youtubers i like so if anyone knows something similar to this king In Spanish...
i think your wrong about kelly, i’d much rather stub my toe then have look at her for another 5 seconds
Throw back to when I had a purple Bratz tv….those were the DAYZ
Barbied Wire Band name, called it.
I remember thinking kids toys weren't *that* weird. Then my first job was at a toy store and I saw one of those LOL surprise dolls with short shorts held shut by a padlock
13:18 the sims 2
The Barbie Mariposa movies are way better  Just mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
why hasnt kurtis made a kurtistown cowboy hat
The bratz movie unlocked a memory omg
I'm going through a severe depression right now, but honestly you made me laugh so much, that I forgot everything for 28 min :) haha, Thank you!.
i keep coming back here because this video is just too much fun
Im fucking dying at “doth thy carpets match thy drapes” 😂🤣
You should watch Bratz: Starin and Stylin
VIRGIN /j
The angry twerking has me dead 😂
Wonderful video! This was a look into my childhood. But the reason Penelope, the purple dragon, couldn’t fly was because she was scared of heights. Her dad tried to teach her how to fly without being scared but ended up putting a lot of pressure on her. That night when Rapunzel escaped the  tower with the green spell to keep her trapped inside, she got over her fear and became a “mighty dragon”
I really feel like since you didnt use Bratz Rock Angels I cant consider this an official comparison.
bruh did he just call Hedwig a *he*? 8:57
you look like someone from my karate class and it keep scaring me when i see you on my reccomended 💀💀
Idk why but I love this video sm this is like me 5th time watching it and I’m not even joking
never once was the bratz movie actually about fashion. i feel like i've been lied to.
can u pls do the twilight movies i need your thoughts on them lol
damn stealing jenny nicholsons thunder a bit  context: the past few months she was watching EVERY barbie movie in preparation for a new video (ranking them probably) and updating her twitter with her progress in an entertaining fashion :•)
Kurtis 😔 every person who grew up playing and watching both knows Barbie had the better movies but bratz had the better dolls. It’s just a known fact 🤷‍♂️
If there’s anybody here from Mexico we know what vrg stands for xd
Barbie rapunzel:3 year old make a story about rapunzel but barely includes rapunzel Bratz:I think I took the wrong pills
A man with that stash and rad Canadian classic of a hairstyle, opening a video about barbies & brats by aggressively asserting he is not a Virgin.  10/10
Not gonna lie as a kid that gnome scared me too kurtis
9:42 hairs dont have nerves, which means, when u pull them it doesnt hurt. Now, when ur pulling hair and the pulling reachs the sculp, as the sculp has nerves then it might hurt. Das abt it 😶
you're so fucking funny
What’s up Broski 🦋🦋
As a blonde girl who was born in the early 90s I’ll always prefer her. I wanted to be just like her. I did own bratz dolls also and i liked them. I didn’t think anything of it
I can’t believe out of all the Bratz movies you watched this one and not ROCK ANGELZ - that shit was ICONIC and I spent months playing the subsequent PS2, PC and Gameboy versions of the game
26:30
I thought the brats movie was a fever dream but NO?!
weasel moans 6:20 8:37 11:00
😩
bratz fashion pixiez is lowkey about drug theory and you can't tell me otherwise teen rebels and hangs with wrong crowd to gain something promised, going to late night raves in which you fall into a " trance " if you dance along and the song playing during the rave scene is preaching " just let go " when the phrase cymbaline's mom always told her was to never let go
6:33
0:37 this gave me flashbacks of that creepy hidden screen in the Sonic CD sound test?! “Fun is infinite with SEGA enterprises”
Honestly there’s better movies he could have picked
Hedwig is a girl 👀
I'm happily surprised ,  That barbie Rapunzel movie is one of my least favorite retellings of Rapunzel , probably kid me would have enjoyed it more.  But the Bratz movie wasnt half bad  I have to give it major points for actually having music in it and no random silence scene
I was grabbing a water bottle right before he said if u wanna grab a water bottle or whatevs good timing
who's telling kurtis that Hedwig from Harry Potter is a girl
Early Barbie animation was a nightmare
I am BEGGING you to do a series of this. Cause some of the other Barbie movies actually do slap
Why would you make me chooseeeeee
“Do I wanna gnome” is fucking epic 🤣
DO I WANNA GNOME...GOODNIGHT SIR
Hedwig is a girl’s name CurTIS
Look up Tree Change Dolls - a woman from Tasmania recycles old Bratz into more realistic children. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG-7e1vaB18
Kurtis you sneeze like a dad
Kurtis please, please, PLEASE react to a Monster High movie
The weasel moans like Kero the Wolf.
I came here just to say that Bratz will always be superior over Barbie. Like come on! The songs, the clothes, the DRAMA! 😭😂🙄❤️
Before I watch this: the barbie movies are waaaay better than the bratz movies but the bratz dolls have way better outfits than the barbie dolls. Also, I kinda really liked the bratz series as a kid, even though I tried watching it again a few years back and got a little scared. Myscene was matel's response to bratz and they too were kinda good. I liked their animation much more.
why would you even apologize for that artic monkeys joke bro that was one of my favorite jokes that you've ever made
The rewatch value of this video is impeccable
Actually mad bc I got rid of all of my Barbie movies. I had so many it was like a collection. I HAD THE ICONIC ONES 😟
Can we not pin two queens against e/o?? The Barbie movies were great and so were the bratz movies. They were on their own wavelength, one is no better than the other. they aren’t comparable
Kurtis: Chalkzone? Me: YES
a "unicorn with a horn" is called a pegasus  peg a sus  maybe you should educate yourself kurtis and watch the movie "Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus"
Ya hooo da ba yo
The puns were absolutely out of control in this video and I'm only 4 minutes in.
rapunzel is Elizabeth from bio shock infinite confirmed
I feel like he should have compared barbie fairytopia and brats pixie movie since they are at least a similar premise.
Bratz fashion pixies is an iconic movie
''That is correct, shawty''
"I can't imagine gothel attending all of these balls" is unironically the funniest sentence of all time to me.
I can’t believe they would have the *balls* to use Dvořák’s New World Symphony for this
You should've watched Barbie Princess and the Pauper, Swan Lake, Magic of the Pegasus or Diamond Castle they are the best ones by far and much better than Rapunzel :(
God I don’t know why but this is truly one of my favorite videos you’ve ever made and I’ve watched it 39 times
21:27 aho
I didn’t think I’d watched the Bratz film but the longer I watch the more I remember what is this-
My tongue swoll
hedwig is a girl how could you not know this🙄🙄🙄😩😩😒🥱
3:40 had me weak
Fun fact: the kid who voices stefan's brother plays the main baby in baby geniuses 2
You're soooo cute!
If you do a sequel you should watch Barbie swan lake or Barbie and the magic Pegasus
Not him choosing the absolute worst Barbie movie ever
I need Kurtis to react to Barbie and the magic of the Pegasus
At least Barbie characters look somewhat human, not like the Bratz who look like aliens with giant heads and hourglass figures.
This was literally my 6th grade science project. Bratz won. Based on my research. Which was 99.9% my opinion.
Kurtis u look like goethals pet
More Barbie movie reviews please
please greet us next time🙄🙄
OMFG THE BALLS GETS ME EVERY MOTHAFUCKIN TIME 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Hello Kurtis pookins bare, I would be up most delighted if you would reveal your sound effect keyboard because there is a sound effect on there I want. Your honorable, huggleton
Dear kurtis poopoibear, I would be most delightful if you would spare your sound effect keyboard you see there is an effect you used in th is video and  i have been looking for it for YEARS. Please reply back to me. Your humblest, Finkleton
One thing is the Bratz were never 'assigned' ethnicities, in order for everybody to relate - Yasmin covers brown, arab, latino people... Sasha represents anybody who is black, Jade is from Eastern Asia, and Cloe is white and/or any light-featured POC dpeending on how you look at them. It's the main thing that drew me to Bratz as a kid, and to this day. The one exception that comes to mind are two characters who are implied to be Arab/Amazigh (Alia & Katia).
Like there is the weasel in The suicide Squad  He will win this year against Barbie's Weasel
My daughter LOVED Bratz Babies!
ya hooo ba de yo (or something  like that)
Bratz wins for the music alone
If her hair is long enough that she can wrap it fully around a post or something, no, she wouldn’t really feel him climbing up because as long as the pressure isn’t on the roots, it doesn’t hurt. That being said, I don’t know that human hair at that length would actually be strong enough....
"Brianna's friends get kidnapped by the pixies and Dylan twerks about it which is honestly a power move" had me dying 😂
Chipper………….. wood chipper!
that big garden gnome that u included a pic of? i go visit that gnome every summer-his name is chomsky and hes now the third largest garden gnome 😔 hes been demoted
Does the winner get $500 or $500 and some macaroons???
You neglected the fact that the fairytopia and mermaid barbie movies are the best movies ever AND swan lake i can literally go on for hours
6:35
As a German who grew up with all the original German fairy tales and fables, seeing this rendition of Rapunzel triggers me unnecessarily hard...
kurtis you fucking killed me with this one my cheeks hurt well done man
I did the exact same thing during Small Soldiers!! Still got the figures too
Gothel from the Barbie Rapunzel movie looks a lot like a mash up between a grown up version of Odile from Barbie of Swan Lake and Rowena from Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princesses
This has unlocked some memories I didn't know I had
I forgot how bad the animating on these were 😭😭
Honestly I preferred Barbie over Bratz by a mile growing up but Fashion Pixies fucking slaps
HE MUST HAVE DID.....the devils TANGO
As a person who used to have really long hair, as long as Rapunzel held onto her hair where it wouldn’t pull down on her head, someone climbing up it wouldn’t hurt at all. Hair can be really thick and resilient at a lengths like that, she probably wouldn’t even feel it
But he hasn't seen the masterpiece Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse yet!
the Rapunzel slander in the comment section is making me sad i loved the movieeee :'))
6:36 6:35
IVE BEEN SAYING THAT THE NEXT TREND SHOULD BE DANCING LIKE BRATZ
Little warning for the video, you shouldn’t drink something if your like me and start laughing so hard that you almost choke on it and that a couple of times.    This is no hate, I love all his videos and always have something to laugh at<3
lmaooo i caught the james reference 🤣🤣🤣
i feel bad laughing and agreeing about rapunzel because it is my favourite barbie movie and very nostalgic but i don't remember it being so cursed my god
Rip our extra greeting </3 you will be missed 😔
why are the gnomes irish
Y'all remember Monster High? My sister loved those things. She was like the epitome of girly girl but had all these goth girl looking dolls and honestly compared to bland old Barbie they kinda slapped
The Bratz commentary had me laughing the whole time
the amount of unintentional flashbacks i’m having rn- ????
just found this channel and i'm really happy cause he's funny, hot and watches bad movies on purpose, which is one of my favorite pastimes
6:35 Saving this timestamp for myself…  No reason…
How did I just find this YouTuber? Dude is hilarious
This literally made me cry laughing. I needed this.
SCROTUM SCROLLS I'm dead
I just wanna see how many Barbie movies this man can watch in a row till he breaks
You need to watch bratz rock angels. Thnx
"do i wanna gnome?" 18:42 youre welcome
brats movies have always been more iconic-
the way rapunzel wraps their hair around the banister stops the dude, who looks like he's humping the hair, from pulling on the scalp. felt like i wanted to comment to make it seem like we're actually hanging out, watching barbie movies :')
Ya hooo da ba doo
BALL SCROLLS LMFAO 💀💀💀💀
unsubscribes cause I got no extra greating
omgg WE are both 27!
10:06 *"Doth thou carpets match thy drapes?"*
Bruh that bratz movie was literally my favourite thing i wantef to be that cool
Rapunzel being bald is canon in Shrek lore
virgin podcast
“doth thou carpet match thy drapes??” please it 2 am i can’t be laughing this loud rn 💀
Kurtis: dO I wANnA GnOmE Me: *Subscribes*
Kurt  Drop the thotz doll NOW
no matter what emotions his face is expressing kurtis's eyes always look completely dead and it feels very unsettling to me
Bratz was a hate crime and you can’t change my mind.
Heh-ay!  I just unlocked that achievement too!  😂
CAN YOU ALSO DO TOTALLY SPIES AND WINX PLEASEEEE 😐 🤌
I READ BARBIE VS BARBZ AND WAS LIKE NICKI????
i think the part about the barbie movie unlocked some hidden repressed memories i had locked away deep inside my subconscious
no extra greeting? 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Okay but let’s be real— Barbie and Nutcracker, Barbies: Princess and the Pauper , and Barbie: Swan lake was the best Barbie movies ever. And my personal favorite Bratz movie was Bratz: the Genie Magic😌✌️✨
“barbie as rapunzel” is my all time favorite barbie movie. the shittier the animation, the better the movie. omg and don’t even get me STARTED on that weasel’s way of saying “village” SKDMSIDMXIS
me being named kelly  me feeling attacked
Maaaan I haven’t seen Small Soldiers stuff In 15 years
I want a shirt that says “Oh my God it’s fucking Kelly”
Literally fucking forgot chalk zone existed. I feel like this huge part of my childhood just flooded back into my brain.
*you are not in control*
the fact that this is the first kurtis video i’ve watched in like a year and i just so happened to not receive a second greeting—
Pretty sure “Big Eyed Girls” was the name of the 99 Cent Store Bratz knockoff I got for my birthday one year as a kid.
23:08 Idk why but this part made me crack up i mean "eVerY day/body when you're walking down the street/has a"
When I was a kid my favorite animated movie that I would consistently watch on Netflix was Bratz: Sleepover Adventure and now I’m obsessed with horror! Huh.
You picked the wrong bratz movie 😭
Omg the gnome in the Bratz movie was literally just an Irish man, like he used words from the Irish language. I Don know whether to take offence to it or lmao at the fact the girls are so afraid of him
I felt like I was watching a Bee Gees music video
Hey Kurtis, did you watch moderngurlz’s video about fashion doll lines in the 2000s by chance? I’ve seen it a million times and I recognize some of what you said from her video.
MYSCENE is where its AT !
23:02
Does Kurtis have dark blue eyes?
I need to just stop drinking liquid when I watch your videos because you as the garden nome screaming "IM GONNA PISS ON YOU" just sent Gatorade spewing across the room lmfao 🤣 thanks Mayor Kurtis!! Thanks!!!
as an irish person, i can confirm that the gnome is a perfect representation of all of us
NOT THE DO I WANNA GNOME
Do I wanna gnome is actually one of the best things I've heard in my life so far
YOU GOTTA REVIEW THE RESORT ITS AWFYL
Is it just me or does 6:00 sound a bit like Hisoka
Kelly was my 13th reason why
the best barbie movie is barbie and the twelve dancing princesses (i also loved barbie and the three musketeers but whatever🙄) and the best bratz movie was  bratz kids: fairy tales hands down no questions asked
i did not subscribe just to not have an extra greeting. what kinda fuckery/ bullshitery is this?????
HE HAD TO PICK THOSE BARBIE AND BRATZ MOVIES. 🙄.
22:05 this in 0.75
Kurtis should react to 5 or somethin barbie movies and rate them hahahaha. I'd pay to see that video.
As an Irish person, that gnome is FUCKING HILARIOUS separately it’s all things people I know would say but I think they were just trying to cram as many Irish sayings into one scene as possible. Fuckin hilarious though
bratz is the gen z inspo
Why does Kurtis look like Tom Selleck in Magnum, P.I.?
Am I the only one who noticed that the apology for the “do I wanna gnome” joke was a reference to james Charles’s apology video🤭lmao that was funny
Why did I lose it at "Mattel me that"? Maybe I never had it.
I’d pay anything for kurtis to review all Barbie movies (esp princess and Pauper )
Fairy rave!!!
why did he pick the worst movies from each franchise?? im crying
Pls do another one
Now I definitely wanna see him react to Monsters High
fr picked the best Bratz movie and worst barbie movie 😭😭
7:52 ummmm
Kurtis: So we're gonna look at Barbie as Rapunzel My brain immediately: gIvE HiM tO mE~ *Auughhh*     I've heard that weasel moaning in almost every language at this point- he's too iconic
I felt attacked in the beginning
lol im so glad everyone else hated the barbie children.
Hornuis weasel
Bratz dolls freaked me out when I was a kid
DUDE FASHION PIXIES IS THE BEST THING EVER IVE WATCHED IT DRUNK WITH A FRIEND LIKE 10 TIMES ITS A METAPHOR ON ACID AND RAVES IDC
🦼
The fucking weasel bit killed me
🚨VIRGIN ALERT🚨
I loved the music in bratz movies they were always a bop
give them to me..~ A-UEGHHH~😩
I can't get over the fact that your chin is hairy in the "rapunzel is bald now" picture and not a single other second of this video bye
People are complaining that he chose the two worst movies but they were literally my favourite ones ...
Close your eyes. 12:35
3:00 damn curtis looks good like that
Just a lil timestamp for me 18:43
Bratz easily wins... Barbie is so boringg
uv gotta make more pls I couldn't stop laughing💀😭✋
~ *bAlLs* ~
if there is any animal that would just be horny all the time, it would be a weasel lol 😂
owls do get horny but they mate for like 5 secs lol
Ok but, nobody’s talking about the apology video from james charles with the music in the background, I was choking on the water that I was drinking
this is the best bratz movie by far
This was the first video of his I ever watched. And I immediately joined Kurtis town and have been a proud subject ever since
I loved how in Tangled, Rapunzel uses a hook for the hair ladder. I’ve also always been bothered by them just climbing it straight and her not caring. The hook probably wouldn’t be that comfortable, but leaving slack between her and the hook and making couple loops around it like she does would take a considerable amount of force off of her head.
i love this is what you do on your free time
Bald kurtis is trapped in my nightmares
anyone else realllyy wanting sam & mickey to see this
My parents didn’t let me get Bratz when I was younger😪 I’m still scarred
the bratz pixie movie is the best movie of all time prove me wrong
dude whats the song in the bratz angry twerking scene cause it slaps
...what... :( this is where it ended.... the extra greetings gave me so much joy. Even when writing this comment google stopped responding, you put my computer through that much shook it froze, the shame THE SHAME. I expect a full-page apology in 2-3 working days or my disappointment will turn into slight irritation, and you don't wanna see me when I'm slightly irritated! #DoBetter #Brocken
Im trying to stay quiet cuz its like 22.32 but I cant help but laugh
im watching this while eating some watermelon and i was laughing so hard at 21:58 i started violently choking on the juices of the watermelon and had to pause and calm down for a minute. i am now writing this comment and my throat is itchy from coughing. i am relatively okay now so i will continue to watch the rest of this video and eat my watermelon. (btw im not over exaggerating at all i genuinely was choking so bad but im okay LOL)   update: my voice is pretty hoarse and my throat is sore ouch
My favorite thing Bratz dolls had over Barbie was that Barbie's accessories were just constantly getting lost, just all the time, I could never find both of her damned shoes. Bratz dolls literally perfectly solved this problem. They made the shoes permanently attached to the dolls' (admittedly, comparably to their bodies, gigantic, but still managably child-choking-size feet) so you lost her entire foot instead and had to play Super-Fashionable Amputee Hospital. My version of this story included Chloe getting a foot transplant from Sasha and all of girls who had matching (or nonexistent) feet made fun of her two different-colored feet and nonmatching shoes.
10:58
Give him to me augh 😫
“dreams can have a deep psychological meaning” my dreams: 18:23
why am i laughing at fart sounds
I honeslty want barbie wire
23:21
23:20 23:19
15:53 LEVI ACKERMAN?
RAILROAD CROSSING WATCH OUT FOR CARS CAN YOU SPELL THAT WITHOUT ANY 'R's
I feel like Kurtis should have to watch all the classic barbie movies at least. Im talking barbie swan lake, the princess and the pauper, barbie nutcracker
Idk why Kurtis reminds me of the guy in that Kesha’s mv, Tiktok.
26:27 what sound effect is that
listen here kurtis, i have a serious business inquiry. see i have a bone to pick with the fact that you absolutely disrespected my girl barb. therefore, i am offering to cashapp you $2 to watch a REAL barbie movie. i’m talking princess and the pauper. it doesn’t have a horny weasel but it has a french horse that i really like a lot so please consider my offer.
"Never mind, they're all freaks c:" lmfaoo
hell yES to the Matrix reference.
I grew up playing with bratz. So many bratz
I need more Bratz Lore
13:11 That's not how abusive relationships work Kurtis. She didn't have the courage to try and risk the punishment before this point.
Kelly looks like a small Jojo Siwa. lol
"do i wanna gnome?" was the best part of this whole video. i lost it
i peed at the "rapunzel is bald now"
I berped in shock when I saw the pixie king transformation
The weasel is the main characters 😌💅🏽
Considering how terrifying most animal sidekicks in Barbie movies are, can we appreciate how cute Penelope is ahh
absolutely love the irish elf and that they made him speak actual Irish thatt i could understand
I HAVE NEVER LAUGHED SO MUCH WATCHING A VIDEO
Barbie condo-
dont mean to hate but you watched the worst fucking barbie movie ahahhaha
Kurhn dolls are best. Fight me.
I was half awake when I clicked on it and I read the title as barbie vs barbz
Bratz Rock Angelz is the best movie out of all of them specifically for the soundtrack alone. "So Good" is a masterpiece
So basically you chose the best possible Barbie movie you could have. Thank you lmao
Kurtis I reQUIRE you to watch Bratz Rock Angels I don’t even know how to describe it but it’s very funny and the origin of the “ewww” sound you use a lot
kurtis should react to monster high next!!
DOTH THY CARPETS MATCH THY DRAPES
can you pleaseeeeee do the live action bratz movie
15:48 DYLAN
I feel like you’d have a lot to say about bratz super babies
Should have watched Barbie Mariposa! lool
Wondering where you found this movie cuz im trynna watch it😂😂 but i only have a videotape and i cant find the full movie on yt. All the rest i do😂 even the other original ones
7:00 kurtis it’s almost 5 am i can’t take this
Kurtis. YOU HAD THE FUCKING CHANCE TO SAY SCROLLTUMS 6:59
Monster High is the best of the 3, those movies RULED!!
I came back to the video just for the gnome part
THE SHADE THROWN AT JAMES
Woodchipper!? I barely know her!
man
Kelly was the representation my giant forehead needed as a kid.
Now you need to do Polly Pocket movies and My Scene girl movies!
in into the woods the climbing of the hair hurts rapunzel ,
10:15 my new ringtone
The EFFORT in this video is FANTASTIC
Getting back to watching this dude again made die from laughing and I needed that again.
actually girls don’t fart
14:33 dude I am screaming every damn time its so funny
Why were these two of my favorite movies as a child
Begged my mom for the stuffed Penelope dragon doll that talked, got it ✅🤣 shit was dope. But I fw bratz more tbh.
🎶 Rapunzel is bald now 🎶
""""BALLS""""
God I've watched that barbie movie at least twenty times as a kid this video is everything to me thank u kurtis
omg kelly
I know this is old, but dude I'm a 40 year old woman and I still make balls jokes.
I know I'm late, but I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS 😍💜
that twerking with an intense fervor the likes of which this realm has never seen legitimately sent me into orbit for 5 full minutes
Wow chalk zones a memory I forgot I had
hedwig is a girl lmfao  also how did you miss the opportunity of comparing dylans huge forehead too kellys lollll
one of the boys is trans in one of the newr ones.
you dont understand how attached i am to the bratz movies. i am almost 19 years old this is minorly unacceptable
My sisters used to watched barbie movies and I can confirm that rapunzel movie is one of the worst barbie movie
skipping a detail about why penelope doesnt escape rapunzel away. shes afraaaaaaid of heiiiights
i loved both 😽
The best part of the video was the “do i wanna gnome”  😹😹
I loved the Barbie movies (especially Rapunzel) but preferred Bratz 😁
as a virgin with a podcast i feel greatly offended by the intro
They’re not ball scrolls they’re scrolltums
Fav scene 11:01
KURT ITS BEEN A MONTH JUST BRIBG BACK THE EXTRA GREETING
Im still mad that kurtis didnt give us an extra greeting >:/
The Xbox achievement took me out 😭
More!!!😂😂😂
Omg, good shit. Fashion Pixies was my fav childhood movie😂😂 Still watch it. Not gonna lie.  We should start a Bratz dance challenge.
This looks like the one instance where it probably wouldn't hurt Repunzel's hair!  Look, she wrapped it around that middle pillar of that window.  Not just yanking it out of her skull like the usual depictions.
i thought this video was titled barbies vs barbs and I’m kinda disappointed tbh
GET GNOMED!!!!!!
18:58 I HAVE NEVER LAUGHED SO HARD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE
You should do the fairy barbie movie, that shit was my favorite movie
This video just brought back memories of all the dolls I was into as a kid like Polly Pocket and My Scene dolls 😭 anyone else?
Low budget Dr.disrespect
10:40 Chalkzone was the best 😄
I demand a rematch with THE classics! Bratz Rock Angelz Vs Barbie as The Princess and The Pauper!
I remember that lawsuit! Basically, it was argued that because the creator of Bratz came up with the idea while working for Mattel, Bratz should therefore be Mattel's property 😭. Absolute bs.
unsubscribed and clicked off as soon as I didn’t get my extra greeting 😪✌️
Can I get a Do I Wanna Gnome ringtone
I had a urge to watch Kurtis dance, it lifts my spirits 😌
lets just say, I loved the barbie movies sure  but bratz was religion.
The editing is superb 😂
Why does kurtis look like the creepy uncle you’re not supposed to be left alone with (this joke was brought to you by me)
21:48 the angry twerking will never not make me laugh 💀
Thank you so much for making this. These were my fav movies okay 😭😭
Barbie gave us Life in the Dreamhouse and for that it is forever immortalized in my heart as the GOAT😔👊👊 (monster high is an EXTREMELY close second). The bratz pixies and diamondz movies were my favorites tho, i rewatched them like weekly lmao
ya hooo da ba yo
bratz all the way cause barbie’s hair looks like plasticine
I was very happy about that Chalk Zone reference.
12:07
He did Rapunzel instead of Princess and the Pauper. God damn.   Tbh I’d pay money to hear this man rip apart every Barbie movie ever made. Just because he chose RAPUNZEL for this. The second Barbie move ever made. I still have this on VHS. I have Princess and the Pauper on BLU RAY DISC WITH A DIGITAL COPY AND DOWNLOADABLE CODE
you should go over the bratz sleepover one lol
Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper is one of the greatest films of all time  Obviously he couldn't review it because he's trying to make comedy but you can't make comedy from perfection.
Kurtis, I can't help but feel you missed a perfect opportunity to say "Scrotolls" there.
This is one of my favorite YT videos of all time- I keep coming back to watch it <3  (Also, movie to review: Babys Day Out, written in 1994. Its very... interesting.)
bless you 28:48
7:00 sounds a bit fruity there buddy
please do a sequel to this
Nah bro barbie movies>>>>>>>
scrolltums
Plz do more barbie movie reactions or bratz
Barbie cinematic universe versus bratz  cinematic universe 😂
*Ya hooo da ba yo*
Ya hooo da ba yo
10:42 IDK why I remember this, but I do, I'm not even 27.
I can't help but think that Penelope looks like a overgrown Spyro 😂
the way the bratz movie is the perfect fever dream for like- all of the tik tok girls OMFG
if i had money i would dress exactly like the brats characters. especially lina and cymbeline
you reminds me Begbie from trainspotting so bad
Hey buddy the 70’s is calling they want their look back. Haha! Love you dude!
im soeey for this but i had to dislike to be the 1900 something
pls review more barbie movies, rapunzel is not the greatest
wait why did i not know there were brats movies lol
Omg the sneeze! Dujdjdjdjd
Now I haven't seen this Bratz movie surprisingly
can we get a round of applause for my man, IRISH GNOME
Kurtis please get rid of the poster in the back in your wall, the holes in the golf ball is giving me ✨anxiety✨
Dude my oldest sister just showed me your videos and this was some funny shit but I was honestly a little disappointed you didn't choose the Barbie Mariposa movie because that shit is fire 🔥🤣🔥🤣🔥🤣🔥
grr false ! >:(
Scrolltem
It's ok Kurtis, I know Barbie is the real winner😎
as weird as the Barbie kids looked, those Bratz dudes were fucking terrifying
Kurtis: Why didn't Rapunzel just hop on Penelope's back and fly away from the tower years ago Me, a grown-ass person who hasn't seen these movies in literal years: you know there was a whole side plot where Penelope was dealing with self-esteem issues with her dad cause she was afraid to fly, right? right?
I have to say that as a kid Barbie as Rapunzel was one of my favorite movies, it was so damn relaxing and one of the ways I got introduced to classical music (which I don't play but love to listen to), and the story was just so sweet it always made me happy
Also Barbie Life in the Dream House the series is actually hilarious
thank you for helping me feel happy after watching scary videos
I had a bratz game that i played the shit out of on ps2, it was fantastic
18:20 it’s Niall Horan
Why does his mustache look CG?
pls have a look at bratz forever diamondz
Vrg: virgin really good
Watching hours of Kurtis Conner content while I have the stomach flu really takes the edge off.
Curtis should do the myscene movies iswell
That gnome joke was definitely a top 10 Kurtis joke
“Rapunzeeellll is baaallld nowwww”  Background guy: “WAAHHOOOHHH”
when i was a kid my mom wouldn’t let me have the bratz dolls and i rlly wanted them BUT i had the gamecube video game bahaha
between all of the movies he chose fashion pixies fr
i named my dog after that weasel no joke my dog is otto
At Haaodido ye tah
The barbie fairy movies hit different
6:34
So funny!!!!!!!
26:32
That bratz dad was a certified dilf
Time to check out Barbie Princess and the Pauper and Monster High Boo York, Boo York
Ok first of all she didn't draw the tower while gthel was chasing her, she did it earlier in the movie to go home and remembered it during the chase. And SECONDLY HOW DARE YOU
How you gonna be Canadian and be sponsored by a company that's not available in Canada :(
I’ve only ever seen one Bratz movie start to finish _(bratz forever diamonds_ - no, I won’t spell it how they did, with a number and a z) and I’m kinda glad because even though it isn’t the best, it is _so_ superior to what I’ve seen and heard of the other movies in YouTube clips and reaction videos.  There was an obese colonel sanders pimp with baby arms adequately called ‘big daddy’ (I watched this when I was REALLY young, so this is my answer whenever someone asks me why I am the way that I am). Who needs a hot, buff king when you can have a cowboy pimp? _Who?_  The visual jokes were okay (there were, like, five I think) and a little humorous. Byron Powell (because what is an early 2000s movie without a simon cowell reference, cameo, or spoof?) and Burdine had the best lines out of the entire script, which was 2% less corny in my opinion, but that’s just my opinion; and there was a character with an uncredited voice actress who went from french to southern REAL quick.  Also drag. _Progressive…_ -until you notice the intentionally wonky boob.-
I didn’t think Kelley was too scary until I literally had a nightmare about it and it wasn’t pleasant nor wanted then or ever again  Edit: In therapy :)
No extra greeting?🥺
kelly?  Chelsea?????
I think putting her hair around the... parapets(?) stopped it from hurting her neck. (I think?)
Kurtis pls transform your channel into a bratz movie review channel.
Princess and the pauper vs Rock Angelz could be a better vs
Kurtis both of these are irrelevant compared to the MyScene dolls Jammin' in Jamaica movie... the song spontaneous combustion still slaps
disliking the video beause i didnt get an extra greeting
For anyone who wants to learn more about the legal fight between Bratz and Mattel:  https://youtu.be/SIy_hD3Qd94
scrolltums
Liked for the mustache
My new comfort video 😊
Why does the Bratz movie make me soooo uncomfortable
*angry twerking*
the barbie movie background look likes a 2000 game with shitty graphics lol😂
I loved the Bratz series way more than barbie. Bratz also had a different show called Monster High, and damn, those character designs were fire 🔥🔥🔥 Barbie is too vanilla and bland.
me realizing that tangled's rapunzel also loved painting and it wasn't an original part of the story.... hmmm sus
ngl the “do i wanna gnome?” joke is the best ive ever heard
Part two please
Bless you.
Out of all Barbie movies why'd he pick Barbie As Rapunzel. I mean, I don't hate it but there are better ones imo such as Diamond Castle, Island Princess, 12 Dancing Princesses, etc.
monster high vs that ass disney villin kid shitz or bratz super babyz best movie
I want more doll movie critiques I laughed so hard loved it
The way -balls- echo every time he says it...
otto is a FERRET
I would rather watch Barbie,  But I also would rather have Bratz fashion.
You look like El DeBarge
You look like the love child between weird al and lee Harvey Oswald.
I can't believe I used to watch those barbie series when I was a kid. These whole series were so misleading and stereotypical.
To me, vrg stands for v3rga
Watch Barbie Diaries next please
9:30 idk why most versions don't address that detail but one of the old versions I grew up reading over and over as a kid illustrated that Rapunzel looped her hair around this metal hook thing jutting out of the tower so that the weight and pull wasn't directly on her neck and scalp when someone climbed it. It also helped it be a stable rope when she cuts her hair above the looped part.
Barbie Rapunzel was so good as a kid
Eughm
Twelve dancing princesses and Princess and the Pauper are so much better tho >:(
Ok, ik this is out of topic, but mh used to be the top tier movie franchise
Why was that gnome one of the best irish performances ive seen in any film tho?   Go away with ye, like, kurtis
So no headwig
I'm a Monster High girl.
funny
Smh this was clearly rigged by the creators of the virgin podcast
you should’ve picked princess and the pauper. js 🙃
i have that rapunzel movie lmao
ya hooo da ba yo
BRATZ oooh
23:37 Just for personal reasons
Bratz supremacy 💁🏻‍♀️
Only a virgin wouldn’t do an extra greeting
why we always gotta pit two bad bitches against each other
That thing you were talking about when Rapunzel didn't even try to leave the tower, is called Learned Helplessness.   For extra sadness,  (Stop reading here if you don't want the sad stuff)  . . . Learned helplessness occurs when an individual continuously faces a negative, uncontrollable  situation and stops trying to change their circumstances, even when they have the ability to do so. we use learned helplessness in animals as a model to try and help humanity understand depression (of which I have) in humans.   Martin Seligman first observed learned helplessness when he was doing experiments on dogs. He noticed that the dogs didn't try to escape the shocks if they had been conditioned to believe that they couldn't escape.  Yeah, big oof. Also, thanks for the good laughs. Love your stuff.
18:58 kurtis watched inside confirmed (like the chad he is😌)
I remember watching the bratz movie as a kid and thinking it was the BOMB it was the best i rewatched it so many times aswell
6:10 & 24:06 LMFAOO
Petition to send kurtis all the baby Barbie 90s toys from McDonald’s that were things of nightmares
Bratz>Barbie
kelly called chelsea now but I like to believe they are separate people and chelsea did something to kelly and took her place
pls shave
"Fuck you Kelly" gave me sudden and violent Codename Colin flashbacks, and now I am craving ska
I can't get over the prince's hands almost fitting around her waist completely
This is one of the funniest things I've seen in a LONG time, thanks Kurtis!
Very upset Princess and the Pauper was not chosen. It is a true masterpiece
15:18 omg kurtis it's liking watching your videos  /j
WAIT A SECOND, ISNT THAT THE ASSHOLE FLAG FROM THE COMMUNITY
Mac demarco typa stache these days congrats
Kurtis.....hedwig is a girl-
bratz fashion pixies was and still is my favourite bratz movie. but looking at it now i realize just how bad the animation is
I never watched that bratzmovie but I have the book  Edit: I was drinking water and spat it out everywhere laughing
I pay taxes here in Kurtis Town so my family can get an extra greeting from the mayor. 😡 😆 😂
My mom didn’t let me have bratz dolls as a kid because of their name lol
bae that mustache aint it 😭
https://youtu.be/eisOKNnRLAw
As someone who watched both as kid... the bratz movies have always been better quality wise.   Though they seem to come in many animation styles...
Wow I love his hair so much
You gotta release these in bulk Kurt, I watch them all in one day
Imagine not being a low quality big toe.
Im so glad we’re finally addressing this weasel
my name is Kelly and it's getting so hard to not take all this kelly slander personally
The case of Connor v. God
I watched this video yesterday, and I had a dream about a Dwarf Invasion because of the dwarves in Bratz. It was a nightmare.
Crazy its like rapunzel is a story about emotional abuse  Of course she wouldn't just try and leave
Not you ruining my childhood Barbie movie 🤌🏼
i fucken hate that i liked this video when i saw it the first time; now i can't like it again.  fix that YouTube!
just a reminder that the weasel is the same voice actor as goku
The bratz pixie movie is the probably the reason why I like goth girls
Lol
My dad didn’t let me play with bratz because they were called bratz
“briettas friends” you put some respect on the BRATZ names
it’s a plot point that penelope is afraid of heights kurtis smhhh
the way you didnt watch bratz rock angelz
I actually don't think it would hurt Rapunzel while he's climbing her hair. Notice how there's a bunch of slack before you get to the part she's holding and dropping down for him? She wouldn't really feel it past that point. My only concern is, is the hair strong enough to hold him? Myth Busters needs to do an episode or something! Ha!
The jokes in this vid are off the charts my guy
I really like the diversity of the Bratz dolls though. I'm Dutch but I have multiple ethnicities including Spanish and gypsy blood. I always looked more like Yasmin when most of the other Dutch girls are stereotypical Chloes. I actually felt a bit insecure about not being Nordic looking as a little girl until Bratz became popular in the Netherlands. Seeing Yasmin and how smart, kind and pretty she was, finally made me accept myself.
this is bringing back core memories and I don't like it
As a bisexual woman, Lena & Breanna from Bratz Pixiez were actually two of my childhood girl crushes. My mom even got me a Breanna doll for my 10th birthday and she was my favourite doll since. I played with her so much, even her factory painted make-up started to wear off.
Why was the gnome Irish? And why did he switch from English to Irish mid sentence? Cailíní (col-eeny) means girls btw
>male opinion discarded
i subscribed for the extra greeting 🤬  u lost a subscriber
Kurtis keeps mentioning the time he forgot, but I'm new to the channel, which video was it
My first time watching him and I like his personality and he’s funny as well
bro u look like weird al in the 90s
This is the most cursed video that Kurtis has ever made, but also I can’t look away
i was 8 in 2001 and i remember when bratz dropped and i was OBSESSED. they just looked so much cooler than barbie dolls, especially the clothing!
Thats the next tiktok dance, dance like a Bratz character. It better be xD
Does anybody remember MyScene dolls?  Like, they had a website (with games) and a movie...with Lindsay Lohan lol
I love how you choose the worst movies from both companies
21:58 she was getting raw dog'd
22:52 funfact: the tounge is the only muscle in your body that won't get tired
I used to have a max steel doll that i liked to play with him more as barbie's boyfriend than the actual ken that i had
When the crow stole her backpack I had to pause the video. I was overcome with hysterical laughter. We all know the kind. Where every time you stop you just crack and fall into chest binding giggles again. I laughed for literally minutes without stopping. I laughed from 9:59pm to 10:06pm because of the crow stealing the backpack. Just in case you wanted to know how broken I am
"Ball scrolls" lol yeah, miss the medieval times.
that’s literally my favorite bratz movie😝😝yes 10/10🔥👩🏾‍🦲
THE IRISH GOBLIN I FUCKING CANT
Actually, in most Rapunzel movies you’ll see them stabilizing their hair on a hook, or in this movie, one of the columns of the movie. That way, it reduces the amount of pressure put on the scalp. It may not have hurt them too much.
the dude answers the question: What would Freddie Mercury look like, if he was a serial killer?
bratz>>>
next W.I.T.C.H Vs winx club? 😫
kurt i followed just for the extra greeting :(
WHY IS NOBODY FREAKING OUT ABOUT THE DO I WANNA GNOME JOKE
I remember wanting Bratz when I was into dolls but my mom refused, saying that they had too much makeup and suggestive outfits. I just thought their removable feet/boots were cool, and their clothes were more unique colors and styles at the time.
Sorry I’m only here for the extra greeting…..
i watched barbie rapunzel and i was inspired to point on my walls.Long story short i got my ass whooped
ya hoo da ba yo
I too cannot forget the weasel. I saw Barbie rapunzel when I was 7 and now at 23 I still think of him almost daily...
*twerks angrily*
but bratz music be hitting nostalgia. im suprised is not bad
We should get Barbie princess & the pauper or nutcracker vs Bratz rock angelz or bratz sleepover adventures (the stories were low key pretty creepy to me when I was little 😂)
Why be depressed when Kurtis Conner has dad jokes?
6:31 ... I 100% couldn't breathe
kurtis- “kelly falls into a hole and they unfortunately save her life” me, kelly- 👁💧👄💧👁
I FORGOT ABOUT CHALK ZONE WTF
#stopkellyhate
I'd honestly pay good money to watch you review the other Barbie Movies
Missed opportunity for a scrolldums pun XD

MY SISTER AND I USED TO LOVE THAT BRATZ MOVIE. We'd watch it so often and pretend we we're the sisters holy shit its been so long since I've thought about that though. definitely top tier movie
Why does the prince in the Barbie movie look like Jeremy Fragrance?
Me:*trying to drink coffee*  Kurtis:*stopping me from taking a sip by making me laugh every 5 seconds*
11:05
Unsubbing from the lack of extra greeting.
Howie mandel
Ok sooo.... if u pull rapunzels hair, is she more likely to get bald or get her scalp ripped off?
Barbie literally invented the multiverse, so I think we can all respect her for that.
the title of this video should've been "bullying kelly for 27 minutes straight"
That Barbie fart woke my baby up 😭
Kurtis should do monster high next
I got a tik tok midroll add I'm done
Scrotum scrolls
I can't- I remember how much I obsessed over the Bratz movie, but bruh the one where the Bratz become kids is just 😔😔😔
not me mishearing that this crow girl bitch was a "trans student" instead of a transfer student... my brain really just goes "but make it gay"
Rapunzel is bald now is my new favorite song
finally
As a girl named Kelley with a big ass forehead I’ve never felt more attacked.
What the fuck do you mean a rabbit named Hobie no one is named that
I come back to this video very night especially 10:58 that shit is so funny I can’t stop laughing
Kurtis.. why would you not compare fashion pixies to fairytopia? 😭
I came back because I missed the mustache 😔
idk bout yall but that mom is so fine..
Wait. Woah woAH WOAH. No one else think the girl voice acting for Lina sounds like Dove Cameron? 👁👄👁
I was thinking it was "VeRGa"
Hedwig was a SHE, not a HE. Get it right sir.     (Not me about to add on that Hedwig could be trans lmao. My gay mind can't NOT think about it smh)
there are barbie movies that are gay as fucc, like veeery gay. review those kurtboy🕺🏽
Now do Barbie mermaidia and bratz genie magic please.
I haven’t seen that Rapunzel movie in ages and forgot how disturbing that weasel was.😹😭😹
Okay but do we remember the cd-rom game??? Bc let me tell you, as a child? That game made interior design my passion
I got so inexplicably happy when the Arthur opening hit ಥ‿ಥ
Kurtis you gotta watch Princess and the Pauper you're gonna love it dude
first time i did acid i watched that bratz movie and it was so fucked  edit: not a virgin
Your youtube persona is a virgin, but you sir, are the king of irony
damn i really though barbie and the diamond castle was high quality ig no LMFAO
YOU NEED TO DO MONSTER HIGH AND EVER AFTER HIGH
he should've done princess and the pauper, diamond castle, 12 dancing princesses, OR LITERALLY ANY OTHER BARBIE MOVIE
Bratz was my friggin childhood it would be hilarious to see Kurtis react to more bratz movies 😆
you should’ve watched barbie fairy secret
I just wanted to say that you're one of the only people who consistently discusses body image issues, and I really, deeply appreciate it.
Dude im trying to see a sequal to this, with him reviewing Barbie Diaries because that movie is the reason for global warming
I sent you my scrotum scrolls. Please reply!
not the slander towards j*mes ch*rles HAHAHAHA 😭😂💀
Now I'm getting doll ads
🤣🤣🤣this was an epic video 🔥🔥🔥🙌lots of love from Nairobi, Kenya, East Africa 🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪
Why does anatomically correct Barbie have the Greendale flag
gnomes be like: "ya hooo da ba yo"
Gd you’re so funny 😭
I totally forgot about Chalk Zone omg 😭
ya hooo da ba yo
The gnome looks like Michael Schurr XD XD XD
So many barbie movies have someone telling someone else a story that kind of loses relatability really quickly in your childhood. I feel like bratz has an advantage where it’s like the whole adventure with your friends kind of thing that isn’t really obtainable but still holds up to more modern childhood aspirations. Eg modelling, summer camp, being talented, having fun, travel etc. I’m still invested in the ideas they hold as a teenager and that makes them really memorable.
God damn that Rapunzel movie activated memories I didn't know I still had. The weasel always creeped me tf out tbh
Petition for kurtis to watch Barbie princess and the pauper
can we please talk about how good the music is in the bratz movie.
I love how the actual main characters are "Brianna's Friends"
the split second shot of the girl who is angrily twerking is still killing me..
YESSS BRATZ FOR THE WIN. This video finally stopped my best friend from telling me that Barbie was better. I'm not saying that all Barbie movies are bad, I'm just saying that the BRATZ movies are better.
Bratz > Barbie
xd
13:07 imagine if she had lied she would hit barrier and fall and become Repudle.
wood chipper? i hardly know her.
18:13 SAVUNG THIS FOR MYSELF BC THE IRISH GNOME IS SENDING MEEEEE
Next up on the list; Monster High movie review?
i was getting major deja vu while watching the bratz portion of this video, then i remembered i used to watch this movie religiously as a child and just happened to put it into the back of my memory
I remember getting a bratz doll for my birthday from a friend and my mom made them return it lol
God, that Arctic Monkeys joke @18:44.
so thats what happened to the mom
Those Bratz movies were terrifying like remember when one of them almost got boiled alive and the other time they tuned all old and stuff? Like geez…
i love barbie movies i don’t care if they’re low budget
"kelly looks like what stubbing your toe feels like" genuis, kurtis
Stephen looks like Danny
Hedwig is a girl.
Kurtis you look like an 80s father
.      Im a Barbie girl in a Barbie wooOoRrld.   Let go Barbie bllbdbab-  Woawwhaow       Edit: yea idk why I did that...            Yea
You absolutely have to react to the winx movie.
#SouthAfricaIsBurning#PrayForSouthAfrica
the barbie movies always made me a little uncomfortable. like their universe feels too “clean” and “untouched.” like they’re being watched or something 😂 idk maybe i’m just being weird.
Watching these as an adult is a TRIP.
The _Bratz Kidz: Fairy Tales_ soundtrack went hard not gonna lie.
In Australia crows totally steal our bags and shit
theres this one bratz ds game and if anyone knows the name ill smooch you all i remember is being stuck in a corn field in the game
you just HAD to pick one that wasn't Princess and th pauper??? that one is LITERALLY the best one
first vid from this dde i seriosuly cannot stopolaughing
Kelly:🕳️🏃🏼‍♀️
Literally the sims 3
nice video, virgin
LOVED this video 👏🏼👏🏼 now a new subscriber! more like this pls
waitt nooo  why didnt you show us the weasels death!!
I remember some things about Barbie Rapunzel bc I loved it as a child but one thing I do not remember is how much her braid looked like a pretzel
I pretty much threw out Barbie when I got a hold of Bratz, I was in love with their clothes and how glam they looked
I’ve seen better and more detailed animation in Nintendo 64 games than what was offered in that Bratz movie.
I’m not even a Queen fan, but you look like all the Queen members had a child
You should do a monster high movie review
Tbh the only correct answer is winx > Barbie/bratz/monster high
DO MONSTER HIGH PLEASE
Actually on the Disney Rapunzel movie, Tangled, Rapunzel has like a lever hook thing that she drapes her hair over for people to climb up and then holds her hair while they climb up it :)
so.... the bad pixies made them dance uncontrollably..? then the good fashion pixie brats saved the friggen day, amaze.
kurt should do a monster high version of this
why does Justin Biber look like Walmart Kurtis
I loved Barbie movies for romance and Bratz for the comedy. However when the Bratz movie of the fairytale girls came out all hands down Bratz won in my opinion especially with the dolls where you can pop off their heads?! Tell me that wasn’t the coolest thing at the time.
❤️✌🏻🥰👑🌴😝🌶🥰⭐️❤️‍🔥✅
Beautiful king 👑
Bratz vs barbies: Barbies win I remember in 4th grade I massacred 50+ of them and honestly I cherish those memories and the movies are fun to watch with friends so barbies win 🥇 100% I really have no memories of bratz dolls so I guess it’s unfair.
hmm you actually kind of look like the weasel from the barbie movie lmao
Should have watched bratz rock angels ITS SO FUNNY
this is monster high erasure
Small soldiers was a great movie!!!
NOT A VIRGIN
"Why stay on topic when you can simply not" ah yes, the ADHD motto
Me who was a Monster High fan watching the war go down:😲🍿
"otto otto blah blah blah where are the biscuits and the blah blah blah" lmfao who remembers
im here again just to listen - 10:15 one more time
kurtis, i love you :>
This video genuinely made me laugh. I was a barbie kid and never realized how weird they were.
you have to check out bratz sleepover party PLEASE
Bratz 💗
i absolutelly LOVE that one bratz film, THE MAGIC, i LOVE it!!
I had both Bratz and Barbies but I didn't watch any Bratz media. You chose my favorite Barbie movie as a child which is neat.
please god shave it
You didn’t even choose the best Barbie movie!!!! Princess and the pauper is superior
Monster high is better then both of them
Call out of guilted body standards 10/10, it adds some spice
im so pissed that he didnt pick Princess and the pauper :// /hj
**angry twerking**
WHAT ABOUT MONSTER HIGH???
16:35
Do Tinker bell
20:25 But isn't Cymbeline evil?
Ya hooo da ba yo
6:33
You probably wont see this or even read this comment but i think if you made a video on other bratz movies mainly the bratz super babies movie or whatever where they get replaced by like potato alien creatures i know it sounds weird but i think it would make a funny vid :))
I cannot believe you didn’t watch Barbie princess and the pauper you fool
🎶 Do I wannaa gnoome 😩😤  🎶
okay literally toy soldiers scared the shit outta me as a child!
Honestly Love Both, But I Enjoy These Random Subject Vids lol ❤️
I wonder how monster high dolls felt watching this video 💀
WHY DID KURTIS LOOK SO GOOD BALD BYE HAHEBFM
God I loved the Barbie Rapunzel movie so much but it does indeed look like shit 🙈
KURTIS WHY DID YOU PICK THE W O R S T BARBIE MOVIE POSSIBLE
i got so happy when seeing that you were talking about those amazing barbie movies that i was so obsessed with when i was little
i had a barbie fishing rod
yes
I wish he would've chosen a different Bratz film, I remember others being so much better.
Not picking Rock Angelz hurt me at my emotionally stunted memories as a 10 years old
Died at angry twerking kurtis
Around 22 minutes I started fuckin crying couldnt even open my eyes "the angry twerk" i-
18:43 I did not expect the random Arctic Monkeys reference 😭😭
can u do monster high vs ever after high?
#kurtisconnerisoverparty
21:40
I know you don't give a fuck but can you do a Gabi Hanna reaction video omg
As always, really good video, and great concept. I would love to see more of these
lmfao high rn
Why doing a vs when you can have both
"Bald rapunzel is not funny and stupid" Bald rapunzel 10:15
Bratz movie is like a wild 8 year old dream lol
idk why but i feel like kurtis really popped off in this video with the jokes, i choked on my water way too many times to count XDXD
LOL this is so funny hahhahaha
Atleast bratz has more different skin colors and ethnicities for their dolls and in movies barbie is almost only white
Ironically you have a Barbie ad in the middle of your vid lol
Kurtis and Harry Styles both had a moustache when this vid was filmed MOUSTACHE SUPREMACY
I played with both growing up and I liked Bratz way more
Please do a review of Barbie in Princess and the Pauper, it’s far superior
@Kurtis Conner. uuhhhh Hedwig is a girl XD
I was hoping you would’ve watched Princess & the Pauper/Rock Angelz. The first is the most loved Barbie one and Rock Angelz’s villains are iconic.
Okay yes the Bratz movies were trash but Bratz babies were gold
very cool arctic monkeys reference thank you kurtboy
The memories from all the Barbie movies 🤭 my mom got me like all the movies on dvds and we would watch them together hha
You should watch Bratz: Super Babyz
Wait did he not say… (Twitter crowds screaming)
I will never forgive Kurtis for not choosing princess and the pauper
that specific bratz was my childhood and the gnome part scared me too
you should've watched the 12 dancing princesses or princess and the pauper not rapunzel
sorry but that matrix clip SENT ME lmfao
me unsubscribing bc I didn't get my 2nd greeting
The Barbie movie doesn’t suck! You suck!!
The purple dragon doesn’t fly up to save rapunzel becuase she CANT FLY!!!
I've 100% seen that bratz movie but I think I stored it so deep in my mind that it should've stayed there
Lena is just Azula in a different font
bratz over barbie any day
kurt you picked like one of the worst barbie movies
2:41 - 2:44 If Kurtis 'hearts' this comment, he confirms it. Kurt's was one of those kids who took off the clothes off barbie dolls, and that's how he made that discovery.
I thought it was a ferret
you are killing me kurtis, 10 out 0f 10 content
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
I like bratz more just bc I could actually relate to the doll. I looked like yazmin so I felt more inclined to bratz.
Bratz super babyz is way more terrifying trust me. Those potato things gave me nightmares
Never noticed this but who gave them the pixie glasses how did they know they were pixies but when she saw her fly away she was surprised like she didn’t know
FASHION PIXIES WAS THE SHIT
imma need him to watch different movies both picks arent the best😂😅
Really though? I’m not biased here cuz I haven’t seen either movie but that Bratz movie sounded so crappy lol. I would have at least rated them both equally bad.
pls make another one of these🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼
The animation and art style gives me heavy foodfight vibes
This has to be the only really low quality Barbie movie- right?
Awesome video with great editing! I grew up watching these movies! It's great that you reviewed them! You got a new subscriber!
Being born in 2001, barbie films are like fever dreams in my memories and bratz films are iconic, I still quote them
girl I'M suing you for not liking barbie as rapunzel more...
Not gonna even watch this video. Why would you pitch two bad bitches against each other smh
my mom thought the Bratz were creepy so i wasnt allowed to have any😔
not to flex or anything but I owned every single barbie movie when I was younger.
i think that girl was feelin the grove a little too much 22:58
I remember the weasel...it SCARED me
Ok but you cannot deny the absolute MASTERPIECE that is the barbie repunzel theme song
This is quality content💀
when he mentioned the paintbrush i realised that i had seen this movie. i thought that it was a fever dream but no, it actually happend
allow me, mistress.  *~mHHM~*
it is 3:43 am and ive been laughing for atleast 5 minutes at the angry twerking bratz doll
I can't be the only one that was wounded by the lack of extra greeting?!
unsubbed where the hell is my extra greeting, kurtis. is what i CAME Here for
The uneven frog marginally sip because paper observationally cough at a helpless open. verdant, measly leaf
This guy is doing way more for me than therapy ever did
Is this Barbie movie the Snyder cut?
Fuck Kelly is real who else would steal my gender??????
The Do I Wanna Gnome Know Joke was too good
i Cannot drink any liquids while watching yr videos they will just come right out of my mouth while laughing
im wondering why he wouldnt compare the bratz pixie movie to barbie a fairy secret, since they seem more similar in what theyre about
I liked bratz 600% more Barbie was biting my kids will only have bratz
DUDE! Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper!!!!!!!! By far the greatest film ever made! its a masterpiece
Now Kurtis need to watch Monster High
you shoulda watched the sleepover or fairytail bratz movies
omg animated movies are so much better dubbed in Brazilian Portuguese, and yes I’m biased
not nick being in the begining
Therapist: Horny weasel isn’t real, it can’t hurt you.   Horny weasel: MMMM! UAAGH!
Tyga music and saying sorry im desperate while crying is that having a go at james if so 👏
28:48 bless you
barbie had hoe tops and bottoms and no onw said anything smh
I can't believe I didn't get an extra greeting from you. Unsubsibing!! 💔❤️‍🩹❣️❤️‍🔥
i’ll never stop thinking about the fact that they put an actual irish word in a brats movie for absolutely no good reason
the best barbie movie is barbie diaries idc what anyone says
ya hooo da ba do
Awkward that Hedwig is a girl…
I’d pay for him to watch the Bratz movie where they weren’t teens, like the one where they get transported to a fairytale world, or the one where they’re babies and become super heroes
Thats exactly why my mom didn't want me to have a Bratz doll
THE WIESEL
the pixies party is the rave I'm craving for rn
WHY IS NONE TALKING AB THE NO HEAD-WIG ?? JOKE PLSS
BRATZ VS MATTEL LORE AUHDHSH HAHAHAAAA did u guys know that mattel didn’t pick up on bratz when the idea was pitched to them BUT after bratz got popular they released monster high which, as much as i love them, they look VERY similar to bratz as far as faces and bodies go
asjsjsjjsjj i’m exited to WTACH THISSSS i wrote my college essay on bratz im so obsessed
princess and the pauper is the best barbie movie.
ya hooo da ba yo I can't stop thinking why didn't he compare the bratz pixie movie with the barbie fairy movie & I'm only mad at myself
No competition here. Best Barbie movie is the Fairy Secret movie. I remember the animation being the best thing I’d every seen. I rewatched that movie just last week. Still the best animation I’ve ever seen.
11:06
we didnt get an extra greeting.my dissappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
Barbie. Bratz are creepy.
Next up Monster High Vs Ever After High
you're 27 years old i cant believe this is how youre spending your saturn return im so proud of you
I watched that movie so many times lmao...the Bratz one v:
if he would have chosen barbie an the diamond castle this video would have gone entireley differently
“Do thy carpet match thy drapes?”  I freaking lost it dude
after watching this video kurtis, i am in just total disbelief that you didn’t do a ‘Barbies vs Bratz vs Monster High’. Kurtis, you heathen.
No no no this is all wrong. Should've watched Bratz Super Babiez 2007..
Mommy mommy mommy mommy mommy
Steve buscemmi
“i’m not a virgin” sounds like exactly what a virgin would say …
How am I just finding u now. I can’t stop laughing honestly holy shit. I thought the bratz tip toeing was way too fucking funny
kurtis im so high i just called you kory conner
“MATELL ME THAT” I FKN CANT–
No extra greeting? I’ve never unsubbed so fast :,(
I bet you cook with extra virgin olive oil so you don't feel smuttayy
am i the only one who remembers someone getting thrown into a lake in the bratz movie???
NOOO you should've watch Bratz Rock Angelz lmaooo
you can't just compare the worst barbie movie to the best bratz movie to make such an important decision
Omg I watched both of these as a kid and I 100% thought every memory I had of that Bratz pixie movie was a fever dream
Did he really not greet me??
6:18 7:57
very very disappointed
There were multiple parts of this video that made me genuinely laugh out loud
I’m unsubscribing…I wanted an extra greeting 😞
18:57 ARE WE JUST GONNA GLOSS OVER THE ABSOLUTE SHADE THROWN HERE 😂
Chalk zone was my favorite 😭😭
I support u only doing one greeting, u owe us nothing, we do not know each other
THAT ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED SENT ME
i swear barbie music is lit. that just didnt happen to be a movie with fire music but lord, IM JUST LIKE YOUUUUUUUUUU YOURE JUST LIKE MEEEEEE NANANNANAAN i can only sing that in german but jesas or the barbie movie with lydia and that diamond castle-  rapunzel was just a bad choice I guess cause its one of my least favorite barbie movies (including the majority of ppl who Ive asked ab it : D)
the friends in the barbie movie names are Sasha, yazmin, jade, and chile just to be clear cause you keep calling them just that one girl’s (who’s name i can’t remember) friends
I wasn’t allowed to have brats because they were too “hoochie”
In love wt u
no extra greeting? im sorry i have to dislike this
Tbh I clicked cause you look like Justin Bieber
he needs to watch princess and pauper aka the gayest barbie movie
17:14
But can we talk about the myscene girls??? Icons!
Omfg Chalk Zone 💀💀 that literally emerged from the darkest deepest depths of my memory
I'm still annoyed that Kelly was forgotten and replaced by three other sisters. Where the hell did they come from!!!
Have not watched Kurtis in so long and I come back to see him with an unholy mustache looking like a small annoying side character in a movie GET RID OF IT ASAP
wow no extra greeting? unsubscribed
So was the sister just an evil pixie? Or was she under a spell? And WTF made the evil pixies evil? I think this movie was made to demonize raves.
This is the funniest Kurtis video I’ve ever seen I have tears on my face this was so funny
Fucking killed me with how many times you put ‘balls’ in there hahahaha. Love your videos kurtis
She's alleviating the tension by tying the hair around the beam, dingus.
21:58 I can't 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂💀💀💀💀
bratz 100%
I want to see more videos like this and I'm not a jerk.
Can we talk about how he literally chose THE WORST BARBIE MOVIE to react too? Like there are so many classics and he chooses on of the Grim spin-offs 😔
watch barbie fashion fairytale i promise u u won’t be disappointed
hell yeah no extra greeting i feel like we are in rebellious territory
just like a white man to pit two groups of strong women together smh my head
When I tell you "rapunzel is bald now" has been stuck in my head for weeks-
The angry twerking had me DYING laughing 😂
… bro you just made me remember a memory I didn’t even know I had lmaooo I used to be obsessed w the Barbie movies like swan lake
you look like Mr Beast aside the hair and stache
So the good pixies are on LSD and the Evil Pixies are on ecstasy/MDMA?
Some of the pixies have really big eyes——
smh there are so many better Barbie movies
i can't believe you reviewed one of the bratz movies i watched as a kid AND you digged it
Okay but what about MyScene
“Now I get a lot of action” Next sentence “Here’s a cool thing I did with my friends”
Can a Virgin have a podcast...  *Girl Defined has entered the chat*
Liking just so Kelly is that little bit closer to hell
Barbie rapunzel  was one of my favorite movies growing up but every doll I had was a bratz doll 😭😭I pick the Barbie movie but it’s still bratz over Barbie Any day😂🤷🏽‍♀️
Can I just say that Bratz freaked me out as a kid? I thought they looked like aliens.
Is he bi?
i loved both as a child. still preferred bratz a bit more. but the barbie movies were of more quality than the bratz movies easily. monster high was also top tier.
Oh you would love monster high
DOTH THY CARPET MATCH THY DRAPES I-
Bratz songs slap though
For me barbie dolls were kinda boring. but the movies were great. when bratz came out I began playing with them more and i would buy every doll and movie.
Ya hoooo da bo yo?
This thumbs up brought to you by “Do I want to gnome?”
I've already seen this but I came back just for the weasel joke. Incredible.
Anyways stan bratz
Why pick one of the worst barbie movies? Princess and the pauper, diamond castle, 12 dancing princesses, those are goated.
Weird but Pretty little liars shares a lot of themes with these movies?
oui
I love how the echo after "balls" is more deafening than Thanos' snap.
I wish you saw Barbie swan lake instead
i feel scammed, give me my extra GREETING
WHYYY did kurtis watch the worst barbie movie??? he could've just watched "barbie the mermaid tale" or something
You being unerved by Alfie the gnome gives me life, for what reason? I don’t know🤷🏽‍♀️😂
THE AM REFERENCE SENT ME
i think if u watched barbie's princess and the pauper instead, that might've won but i liked seeing u sum up rapunzel lol
please watch the bratz kidz sleepover movie
You forgot about MyScene Dolls, they were released as a response to Bratz Dolls, they even had movies (2d i think) You should check it out!
scrolltums
10:53
its 4 am and im dying PLS
“Scrotum scrolls” sounds like what they used before paper was invented.
My mans you should've done Barbie Swan Lake!
my mom was one of those moms who thought bratz were slutty </3
they didn’t send ball scrolls they sent scrolltums
very funny!!   but you didn’t choose a good Barbie movie: Barbie in the 12 dancing princesses  Or a good Bratz movie: any of the later ones. Those are amazingggg and the songs slappp
i’ll always have a bias towards brats over barbie barbie may have grown to become more diverse now but as i grew up it was just a bunch of white skinny girls and i couldn’t relate to it at all
Of all Barbie movies, you pick that one. Barbie Swan Lake is a cinematic masterpiece. It has a talking unicorn!!
omg my childhood
ya hoooo da ba yo
you should see them all
My favourite YouTuber reviews two of my favourite childhood movies, what a time to be alive
Somehow, I always assumed that Bratz was just another line of Barbie products or at least made by Mattel. Weird to learn the truth of it! When they came out teenage me disliked their more "aggressive" appearance. It also didn't help that in the local youth speak the name Bratz was nearly identical to a word for farting...
Still love the old barbie movies tbh, the animation is bad but charming and nostalgic to me. Also, the lack of music and realistic sounds added an ASMR feature and I'm still living for it.
ok now i need you to play the bratz rock angels video game plz
Honestly, my favorite Barbie movie is a Fashion Fairytale. I feel like that's the best point where the studios transitioned from the old-style into the newer, more updated style. After that, it just gets... odd. And any sequel to a previous movie is debatable (i.e. Fairytopia I think was well received, but every Fairytopia sequel was bad in comparison)
Kurtis... bought a wig... 😮
10:15 why he look like idubbbz
kurtis watch the bratz amusement park movie i recently found out that it wasn’t a fever dream i had and actually exists
Rapunzel is just probably into hair pulling.
20:47 stop y is that guy in black built and walking like a roblox character i can’t 😭😭
Stephan looks like the basic LEGO person ngl...
Can't believe Kurtis created a podcast to try to divert attention from the fact that he most definitely is a virgin
My mom never allowed me to play with bratz or watch any bratz movies because she thought it would encourage disobedience
Okay but Bratz wouldn't win if you'd watched Princess and the Pauper man
Should’ve watched Bratz Genie Magic instead!! 10/10 quality entertainment
Okay my mouth dropped at 15:18 I legitimately just got hit w nostalgia I forgot I fucking had
"I didn't mean it, I'm desperate"  James Charles? ...
Yo the Barbie dream house show actually was pretty damn funny. I only saw a couple episodes but there were a looot of funny movie references lol. It still wasn’t perfect, but yeah.
I think my pain of not getting an extra greeting is somehow bigger than Kelly’s forehead
you should review all of the barbie movies
laughing way toooo hard at “Matell me that”
I'm just surprised that the garden gnome was actually played by an Irish guy and he called them cailínís
Kurtis buddy, YOU NEED TO WATCH BRATZ BABY SLEEPOVER, that movie is insane
Don't worry, I get scared when I look at myself lmaooo
The only part I was a little disappointed to not see about Kurtis talking about the bratz movie was the part where the bratz all held hands and the tree caught on fucking fire before the mother turned back to normal
“BaAlLSsS”
ngl Kurtis kinda resembles the weasel
18:18 when someone touches your curry
This is content
his humor is getting more and more millenial. still love him though, hes just getting old
Kurt needs to watch princess charm school
watch the brats tv show
26:31 That echo went on for way too long
You look like my dentist.....................................................................................................................
Dude it has been years since i've seen this...this used to be my fuckin' movie
the club scene ENDED me...
ya doo ba da hoo
"I'm not a virgin, I have a podcast." -_-
“I think this guy needs friends,” -my mom
ya hoooo da ba yo
When I was younger I always thought the Bratz movies were terrifying. There were two that were so terrifying that even now I can't watch them 😭😭 I'm such a baby
okay so what im hearing is next week we do barbie mermaidia vs bratz rock angelz
Can we talk about the fact that Penelope the dragon has human hands 12:55?
23:39 why does he kinda look like brian may🗿
10:56 LMFAO
React to Oli London. You saying that subscribing will automatically turn you into a valued citizen of Kurtistown reminded me of him.
Barbie movies was my childhood, and I still watch them to this day. Barbie movies are actually pretty good. It has its diversities. And majority of the movies represents women independence.
Fuuuuuuuuuuuck imma need to commission some scrotum scrolls
YOU CHOSE THE WRONG FUCKING BRATZ MOVIE???
Last week a saw this, and thought this was a movie rewinding channel. Holy cow I was wrong🙌🏻🐮 but now I’m a proud member of Curtistown
7:45 damn...I guess I just aged 11 years and became a man
Just gotta wait for a monster high review now
hey I just wanted to chill with my morning coffee and now there's coffee all over my table. I don't even know why it took me so long to find this channel. big thumbs up!
He looks like justin bieber. I cant be the only one noticing this
Hedwig is actually a girl, even though not all actors were female. She's supposed to be a girl xD
Now I need kurtis to watch the monster high movies 👁👄👁
barbie and the magic of pegasus please i beg u
Can you make this a Series I love this there are so many Barbie and brats movies to compare 😭
You probably get this a lot but you look like Evan peters
Bratz is good fight me <\3
If you're curious, someone calculated how much rapunzel's hair would weigh, not counting the Prince climbing it. https://youtu.be/-5fYV2jkcnQ
Really weird to watch Barbie as Rapunzel in English cause I can't listen to the pega ele, frita ele, faz purê
dude pls watch the Monster High movies
Barbie rapunzel was a memory I didn’t know I had
Wait but this is legitimately the funniest video I've seen on YouTube, never hit subscribe so fast
PLEASE watch the Bratz Genie movie 😭 you will have a great time, I swear!!
Bratz Rock Angelz outsold Bratz Pixies
18:59 james charles channel 😭
But Monster High is really where it's at...
Rapunzel is the best one, and Kelly’s movies are pretty good to
Dude you gotta watch Bratz Kids: Sleep-over Adventure! It actually gave me nightmares as a kid and I think that’s really embarrassing for me
What’s interesting is a few studies found that girls who played with bratz rather than barbie dolls were more likely to get pregnant in high school
Poor fucking Kelly.
Allow✔me🥴mistress😩
I don't understand how I always know every reference you make to something remotely nostalgic. It's so specific XD
when kurtis twerks better than u
all of the barbie movies felt like a fever dream to me
You should collab with aaron and jo because they hate the barbie kids too! 😂
Ppplllzzzzz watch Barbie life in the dream house 💀💀💀
I gotta say Kurtis town is pretty fun. Also am I the only one that gets oddly relaxed by Kurtis' voice? Like I laugh at the jokes but could also fall asleep.... Like what?  Maybe it has to do with that fact that I'm laying in my comfortable bed with my comfortable pillow and comfortable blanket but I really don't think that's a reasonable explanation.
2:53 idk that looks like a little bit more than twerking…
Can we just take a second to just appreciate that kurtis gives us an intermission? Cause I did in fact need a snack to finish this video
*to the toon of Allentown by Billy Joel* well I’m living here in Kurtis Town. And he’s digging lots of holes in the ground.
do i wanna gnomeeeeee if these girls will run away, sad to see them gone :( kinda hoping that they’d stay
Idk why i thought he'll show Rock Angels hahaha
I was not given what I was promised. Watch it kurt
Watching this gave me so much memories that i did not want! 🤣😂❤️
ya hooo da ba do
I know A Greendale flag when I see one….
"YA HOOOOO DA BA YO"
wait did we get an extra greeting?
Nothing could have prepared for for Kurtis' angry twerking face goddamn 😂
18:18 "you know it's time you nosy cailínís got yourselves a milllion miles away from here" we love some us incorrect Irish here  😩 🖐
No extra greeting?!?!? UNSUBSCRIBED
does anyone remember that live action Bratz movie where Yasmin is straight up rude as hell to Dylan for no reason when she meets him for the first time until she realizes that he’s deaf.
Should have watched the fairytopia movies, I remember they slapped as a kid. Much better than the rapunzel movie. I have no idea why I watched so many.

WILL THY CARPETS MATCH THY DRAPE 😭😭
18:52 kurtis regretting he’s life decision
It’s just occurring to me how weird it was that a rival king just… DUG A HOLE?? FOR FUN⁉️
scrolltum
Wow we did not need to know if you were a vegetarian or not 😂😏😒🌱
I support u kurtis fuck the greeting do what makes u happy, YOU ARE NOT WHAT YOU CREATE!!!!
Can you pretty please do a separate series where you just watch Barbie and bratz movies?
"doth thou carpets match thy drapes" HWEFJKSDKNKSED
i loved bratz and barbies when i was a kid but bratz dolls are better 1000000%
That Barbie rapunzel (?) movie was one of my favorites as a kid lmfaoooo I literally forgot about it.
Laughed till I cried. (Could do with fewer poop/shit jokes though.)
Ya hoo da ba yo
If I don't get an extra greeting what's even the point?
The Bratz movie is like if someone tries to write a Beautiful Creatures fanfic but didn’t read Beautiful Creatures
Polly pocket was superior
sequel with monster high anyone
Review more Barbie movies! I subscribed- and I didn't get my extra greeting so you owe me. 😬🙏
The Bratz movies in my opinion are some of the best animated movies ever….. and I recommend watching every movie
dont compare the two heaven peices
Who hired the voice actor for that ferret.
ya hooo da ba yo
2:44 another result of the green new deal
yo hooo da ba yo
the bratz movie is confusing me
Pls more Kurtis dancing
kelly is creepy i agree
ya hooo da ba yo
I'm sueing... u didn't pick bratz rock Angelz?!
I need more movie reviews
“I’m going to piss on you!.”  Me: WHEEZE
that rabbit looks like he has seen some shit ngl
forget barbie and bratz, monster high is where it’s at
he really did choose the worst barbie movie ever made💀 a movie i loved as a kid was A Fashion Fairytale lol
I’ve seen the Bratz movie forever ago I thought it was a fever dream
Omg you chose the weirdest of the bratz movies 😂 Bratz Rock Angles is the one that fucks. Barbie Rapunzel… honestly I remember that being a favorite of mine but I did but remember any of the plot 😂
th-...the extra.....kurtis..the extra greeting..........
The comedic timing is TO MUCH😩🖐
why would u pick barbie as rapunzel out of all the other barbie movies
Can't believe you picked a Barbie movie without songs. The songs are the best part!
My parents would never let me play with Bratz dolls but I was allowed to watch all the movies despite only being allowed to play with Barbies and for some reason I never questioned that when I was like 7
“Scrotum scrolls” took me out 😩
The “allow me mistress” reenactment 🤣
Kurtis mocking james charles' apologize video? wonderful
My lil sis loves barbie back in the day and yes ive watched the majority of the classic 3D barbie movies
give him to me EÉUGH
You should’ve picked Barbie fairytopia!
Brats movie soundtracks slapped
The musical Into the Woods shows Rapunzel in pain as he climbs her hair
Ok but....monster high????? They are superior to both Bratz and Barbie
bro out of ALL the barbie movies... he picks RAPUNZEL... that's just the worst one im sobbing
The bratz dolls were better because they were more inclusive, but I love the female empowerment in the other Barbie movies. Ngl Rapunzel was one of the worse ones. It’s still good tho.
bratz is more trendier, diverse, and better. barbie is just basic and eurocentric. mattel only tried to sue barbie cause they were being pussies lmao
"Dylan walked so eboys could run their fingers through their hair"
Good  vid, Kurty                                                     ya hooo da ba yo
A new age has begun
The fact you didn’t watch Barbie of swan lake????? Heresy
I look like Kelly
“MaTTel me that”
"Doth thou carpets match thy drapes?" 10:06  He just had to sneak a redhead joke in there
But does anyone remember  'My Scene' dolls. I feel like they were the most realistic and diverse
i haven’t watched kurtis in like 7 months and he looks 40 now
Bratz Rock Angelz could’ve been a better pick💔💔💔☠️☠️
can you please review all barbie and bratz movies please lmao
I literally have never laughed harder omg plz make more of these!!!!
I have two sisters so I watched a lot of Barbie movies as a kid... definitely chose one of the weaker ones Kurtis lol. If you ever do a follow up to this I'd say choose like Princess and the Pauper. I remember that one being better.
I'm glad I had earbuds on
The king: (in borat voice ) MY WIFE
Bratz fashion pixiez is by far THE BEST Bratz movie
I cant believe we didnt get an extra greeting 😩😩
The angry twerking took me out!!! 😂🤣
This whole video is pure comedy 😩😭😂 I haven't laughed this hard in so long, Kurtis. Thank you for your service
the fact that you’re doing a video about barbie and not making it about princess and the pauper is an outrage
A woo bono is Latin for horney whesill
0:46 LMAO i thought the friend they were referring to was one of his action figures
As a Barbie girl named Kelly, I’ve never been so honored to be roasted the shit out of. I want to meet Kurtis so I can personally thank him.
I think I favored Barbie movies because they did come out first. But I preferred to play with Bratz. So that is what it is I guess
my favorite barbie movie was fairytopia and i need kurtis to review it
My brother went through a phase where all he wanted to do was copy me and I tried so hard to never let him see me watching barbie and bratz movies because then he would do it too and everyone would know I was watching bratz fashion pixiez for the 23rd time.
bless you 🥴
I mean Barbie released dolls with varying skin tones back in the 1970s but sure, Bratz was the first brand to do that...
Why does that Barbie movie looks like it takes place in the Spyro game world?! And…Spyro is in the movie?! Am I crazy here?
Unsubbing because there’s no more extra greetings and now life is meaningless 😔
more like this!!!
en español se lee como verga jajsjaja
kurtis i just want you to know that i laughed so hard i had to pause the video bc your existential silence wasn't long enough when you said "do i wanna gnome"
The songs in Fashion Pixies slap fr
My 4 head is bigger that that child’s
Kurtis...,my buddy, my guy, you can’t just stop there! We need a tier list! You gotta watch them all!
any of yall collect moxie girlz?
After Kurtis did the weasel sketch, I got an ad for a pregnancy test app......
18:44
Bill Wurtz is that You? 18:44
Your fucking hilarious you had me dead💀💀
I am very much not used to sharing names with a movie character, and it feels like Kurtis is trying to convince everyone I'm a pixie  I promise I am a human being. Nothing magical about me. Nope. Just a normal person.
the more he repeats he's not a virgin, the more I feel like he is lol.
so Kurtis, a grown man watches Barbie and Bratz - i stan
I don’t mean to start some shit but princess and the pauper is the superior Barbie movie
I’m disappointed that you called hedwig a he
why didnt the kings in the barbie movie kiss
As a kid I always thought barbie’s hair is blond so you can colour it easier
ya hooo da ba yo
LURTIS RHANKS SO MUCH i continually think about that barbie movie and can never remember the name and now i do
Ok, but Barbie three musketeers, Barbie Mermadia, and Barbie princess and the pauper are all top tier
vrg stands for VERGA
Wtf Kurtis. I subscribed specifically for the extra greeting. How dare you treat me like this. I deserve better. You’re our mayor! Treat your citizens with respect!
Bro Kurtis I'm WEEZING AT YOUR ANGRY TWERKING
Bratz was better overall
Older generations: The new generations are gonna change the world, make it a better place! Millennials: *trying to make sense of their old kid's movies*  : this is crucial..
7:18 *Inserts secret tunnel joke*
you look like Pablo Escobar and Hitler had a baby
bestie i can’t do this anymore. i haven’t slept in a week. i want my extra greeting i know i was aggressive before but you don’t understand just how much this affects me. like why just why. i literally can’t that extra greeting was the best part of my week and you just ripped that away from me. why? kurtis my whole family is dying because of this my cats got pneumonia and cancer my dad had a stroke my mom has skin cancer and my sister has been captured by pixies and is being tortured in their dungeon. bestie please i can’t. i’m barley hanging on anymore i don’t know how much longer i can do this for.
I'm from Germany I've never heard from Bratz 👁️👄👁️
Whyyy stay on topic when you can simply not - what some wise words these are
watch more please, so i dont have too
It’s alright Kurtis, you are entitled to have your own wrong opinion
just wait until he finds out that barbie a fairy secret exists
But the extra greeting….
Hey Curtis, you do not have to disclaime that you have no daughters.. everyone knows that virgins cannot have kids 🥲
I was obsessed with that bratz movie as a kid 🤣
I almost spit my drink at “MaTELL me that”
I almost spit my drink at “MaTELL me that”
superior barbie branch: myscene
i almost cried without my extra greating
23:36 bro be dancing like a toddler
Guys remember that one time that kurtis didn’t give us an extra greeting
If the kids in Barbie movies/shows look like that then what what kids in bratz shows/movies look like o_o
Also she didn’t leave on the dragon years ago cause the dragon couldn’t fly .cmon man watch the whole movie
It took me the rest of the video to recover from the do I wanna gnome thing
Barbie and the nutcracker is the bomb... thank you
Is there any way you can keep breaking down bratz movies?? I love these 😂
nanananana the best Bratz movie is rock angelz and the best barbie movie is..... shit that's actually hard probably princess and and pauper but my personal fav is swan lake
Barbie was for the straights. Bratz was for the gays
there are dolls they sell to little girls that shit though they're just baby dolls.
Kurtis I will pay you to watch more Barbie movies
When we were little kids my sister had that Barbie movie. I do not remember it looking that bad
I’m 10 I’m A KID
Okay but bratz fashion pixies was one of the best ones. I watched that movie on a loop as a kid.
I would honestly get rid of barbie if we could bring back bratz, og monster high, and ever after high
I would come to your show but my ant says I’m not old enough im10 wish I could come 😐 sorry
the barbie diaries animation is god tier!
I vaguely remember the myscene movies coming out at about the same time as the Bratz movies. Honestly they all seem like fever dreams more than memories.
ya hooo da ba yo
Me: ….Monster High
Him: The letter stand for ＶＥＲＹ  ＲＥＡＬＬＹ  ＧＯＯＤ, my ＰＯＤＣＡＳＴ, not for ＶＩＲＧＩＮ!! Me, thought the letters stood for "average" but we couldn't see the a from the camera angle: haha, virgin
this video was uploaded on my birthday 🎂
Kurtis I just want to say that I died and cried laughing at the video please do more reviewing I’d greatly appreciate it omfg
I havent laughed so much at a kurtis vid in a while XDXD this is amazing
Holy shit lol any time I’ve brought up small soldiers, nobody knew what I was talking about. Maybe I only knew of it bc my brother is your age (I’m 22) but who knows
🔊🔊📣📣🎶FEEL THE GROOVE🎶🔊🔊📣📣
As funny as that "Rapunzel is bald now" bit was, no it wouldn't hurt if you anchored the hair properly. As long as your neck isnt the only thing supporting their weight, you probably wouldn't feel a thing.
Rapunzel is 10/10 and i wont accept anything else
8:41 👀👀
y'know honestly as a kid, despite being mixed race and looking different than literally all my peers, I really didn't pay attention to the skin color of dolls.  because I was a furry and I only wanted to be a dog.  bro I used to watch the barbie rapunzel movie on repeat JUST for the dragon XD
Kurtis we need more bad movie reviews, pleaseeeeee
I never watched the bratz movie but that resume felt like a fever dream
THAT BRATZ GNOME SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF ME!!!
Fashion pixies is one of the worst bratz films to be fair
Are we just going to gloss over the fact that Lina can turn into a crow and she took Dylans bag for no reason at all-
I remember seeing a compilation vid of that weasel moaning and it pained me so much
Well when I read Sigourney Weaver I think of a beaver instead of a weasel but go off ig  🤷‍♂️
are bratz movies 1000% better? yes. did you choose the WORST barbie movie to watch? ALSO YES. there are so many barbie movies that slap so hard and make a better competition. put respect on barbie’s name 😤
i always see people who watched these movies as a kid talk about them so it’s interesting to see someone who has never seen them before talk about them lmao   and yes bratz fashion pixies sits on her throne
I saw fashion pixies an never clicked so fast in my life
ur reenactment of climbing hair was oddly similar to the Broadway version of into the woods and I love it
I want kurtis to review as many barbie movies as possible.
watch the [as] video of “I know what the bratz did last summer”
I feel disrespected and not welcome in this town. Kurtis Town to be exact, because I didn't get my second greeting...
Why do I remember the Barbie movie being wayyyy more of a higher quality than it is 😭🤚🏽
Bratz dolls have the worst beauty expectations.  Not only do they have unreachable facial proportions, but they also have removable feet.  How's a girl supposed to compete with that!? 🤷‍♀️
ya hooo da ba yo
out of context clips that will make you laugh: 21:27 16:35 18:19 18:44 6:33 10:59 21:44 17:42
Watching an Irish gnome chase bratz dolls while saying “gó on wíth yé!! Skitterh!!” Was something I never knew I needed
it's funny how you'd think bratz are more inclusive as in like oh Sasha is black and Yazmin is Latina... I learned recently that Yazmin is actually Persian? but sometimes she isn't? it's a bigger debate than you'd think
Talking about horny animal sidekicks, that reminded me of that Hedwig/Hagrid fanfic I came across once. Scarred for life.
MyScene was where it was at. 🤷‍♀️
19:38 fuckin dead
No extra greeting 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I don’t think i can forgive you for that arctic monkeys reference 😪
My mom wouldn’t let me have BRATZ dolls bc they were “trashy” 😂
if alex turner heard that "do i wanna gnome?" joke he would probably punch kurtis in the face
Bruh I'm pretty sure I still have VHS copies of my Barbie movies in my basement... those movies went so hard for NO reason lol
8:23 I'm gonna imagine he's not coming back.  also if you pause right at 15:40 it looks like some 2001 RPG game.
Rip Kelly, she’s currently fallen into 245k holes😔🕊
Still mad about you forgetting the extra fretting. Please say you’re gonna continue the extra greetings
I present: do I wanna gnome, by attic money Do i wanna gnome? too busy bein' gnome to fall. Sad to see you gnome, ever thought of gnome, darlin'.  Do I wanna gnome? Do you want me gnomin' back to you?
Someone else noticed the greendale symbol in the ultra realistic Barbie
ever since i watched fashion pixiez when i was like 4 it has been engrained in my mind and ive loved it since, even on rewatches. im 20 now.
I wasn't allowed to have Bratz dolls because my mom didn't want me to be a brat😭 (it didn't work lmao)
The greendale logo for the functioning asshole bit was a great addition
Kurtis: they also end up finding a secret tunnel out of the castle into a nearby village. my brain: SECRET TUNNEL. SECRET TUNNEL. THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS. SECRET, SECRET, SECRET, TUNNELLLLL.
THANK YOUUU for talking about the unattainable beauty standards for women created by the media!
no extra greeting. this is an outrage. I can't believe you.  (this is a joke)
I actually liked Barbie more because of the fantasy figures, I only bought those
Im 20 rn. If you asked me ten years ago what id be doin on a tuesday in june, i truly wouldnt have thought id answer getting high as giraffe balls watching mr porn stache explain the difference between  barbies and bratz
It’s a cold sore
Can we get a restock on the PBNTM line pls :)
actually, the hair won't hurt at all. if you have that much hair you can just twist it around somewhere and it will resist without any trouble. but we are talking about looooooong hair just like rapunzel . ^^ 9:45
That "desperate" shade though, haha.
kelley is my 13th reason
WAIT YOU KNOW AWSTEN KNIGHT?!?!
hedwig was a woman
When I was a small child I had so many Barbies and then I grew into a less small child and had so many Bratz, they were superior imo. Also apparently that Pixiez movie is a metaphor for drugs? Idk
i am only 4 minutes in & can only assume that u r team Bratz
wait where's the extra greeting
16:38 ... Dude those eyebrows needs a different color-
I definitely think you should watch Rock Angelz it introduces all the characters qnd in my opinion it's the best one
I’d be happy to fix the vrg situation if it were true?☺️🤷🏼‍♀️😇
this doesn't count cause you picked the best BRATZ movie and rapunzel isn't that known you should've watched the 12 dancing princesses or barbie ad th diamond castle; i am clearly very passionate about this
The fairies episode of bratz was the best one. Fight me
17:06
18:56 shady omg HAHAHAHAHAH
why does kurtis look like the racist uncle at family gatherings
please please please make barbie saying "balls" as a new sound effect on you keyboard for very really good 😭😭
can this be a series pls i enjoyed watching u watch my fave childhood movies 😩
ugh this video was such a banger
are we forgetting monster high dolls? That is probably the doll kurtis will like more
That Bratz movie looks so shit😭😭 I'm glad I didn't watch it as a kid. Or I'd have been hella depressed
Kurtis’s hair looks like somebody spilled chili
You're such a brat!! This Barbie head still loves you!
I haven't even watched the vid yet cuz saw the title and cover and immediately clicked. Kurt PLEASE, Babs is my girl OK? She has my Black Non-Binary support and as much as I love the Bratz.... Barbie is still my main 😫
ya hooo da ba yo
He really, really looks like 80s-era Weird Al in this.
ya hoo da ba yo
3:44 actually, the reason Mattel sued is MGA didn't actually have the rights to Bratz, it was created by Carter Bryant while he was working at Mattel, in his office, and Mattel has a policy that anything made in the office is legally owned by them, as you shouldn't be working on passion projects while your suppost to be working on a doll, they initially won, until a bunch of incriminating documents from the higher ups were leaked in court, displaying cut throat market strategies to kill Bratz. Isaac Larian, owner of MGA has been trying to buy Mattel since
pls do the double intro :(
ya hooo da ba yo
15:54 BRUTAL 😎👌
Ok Ok, can we talk about Gothel's scroll management ?! Who would just PILE their ball scrolls like that ??? That's not proper scroll etiquette, they are not even around anything, so they can be looked and closed again. WHAT THE FUCK YOU HAG ! ... sorry, got a little hot heated over ball scrolls again.
U look like if Evan peters was raised by shawn’s dad on boy meets world. I say this with all due country boi love.
Testicals
Should've chosen princess and the pauper for the barbie movie :/
I can’t breathe you never cease to make me laugh
the way you say brianna as bre-yanna greatly disturbs me 💀
I used to have the Barbie Rapunzel movie on vhs! Watching you review it felt like reliving a fever dream
Hedwig is a girl bra 😑
Cant believe you chose the least influential barbie movie im not saying this out of hate but out of pity for the missed opportunity
kind of upset you didnt choose 12 dancing princesses but whatever
my mom never got me barbie dolls cause it was hard to find our skin color. I only had bratz and monster high dolls 😭😭
Kurtis Penelope COULDNT fly up there until she was encouraged by her dad or whatever
part two watch bratz genie magic... you will not be disappointed
I cant believe he chose Rapunzel over Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princesses, or Diamond Castle, or Princess and the Pauper. These are Barbie at her PEAK
Horny  Weasels need to be a category in the Hub.
Barbie and the nutcracker is probs my second fav. He needs to check the princess and the pauper out, and then the nutcracker. Idgaf what he watches of bratz, tho tbh lol 😂
holy shot im too high for this
idek why but the "yes" at 8:21 fucking took me outtt
I want him to review the Myscene dolls movie Jammin in Jamaica
Bratz rock angels pops OFF
For the first like ten minutes i thought this was about barbies vs barbz (nicki manaj) until i realized i read the title wrong
Ur so funny
bless you kurtis  EDIT: because you sneezed. i would never bless you otherwise :)
I'm sorry but the Barbie movies, especially Barbie as rapunzel, Barbie in the nutcracker, and princess and the pauper were my entire childhood and I wasn't even allowed to have Bratz dolls so there is no argument
This video made me laugh so hard
Kinda DON'T want Kurtis to review my favorite movie princess and the paper because I'll kinda be crushed lmao Do fairytopia instead, that movie is WILD
“So no head-wig?” B R U H I’M DEAD
I hate being so attracted to that garbage mustache
Mullet coming in strong Kurtis.
Your next video will be the 200th one!
Don't you just hate it when tiny bearded Scottish men cosplaying a gnome chase you? Yeah...Me too      sHeS a PiXiE
that weasel has always made me feel uncomfortable as a kid...even now..
barbie has better movies bratz has better dolls hands down
literally the whole bratz fashion pixiez movie was a reference to drugs
“Why stay on topic when you can simply not”- Kurtis 2021  “Why stay on topic when you can simply not”- students to that one teacher who will forget to assign work if they get off topic
Would it suck if I requested you to watch Barbie and the nutcracker and just dragged the shit out of it ?  hhhhh I loved this video I’m subscribing
"Give him to *me* ?? Ouuughhh~😩"
kurtis i think it’s time to do another tattoo video and show all your tattoos
There was a brats movie where like the girls where getting the like life sucked out of them, and getting turned old and shit it was a fever dream of a movie. I watched allot of Bratz movies when I was like 7 idk man.
Kelly bad Gnome good
I remember when my sister watched this Bratz movie, the dark pixie party scene's track was a banger. I played that shit over and over again 😭 Lina made me Bi and this movie was where my love of dark fashion started LMAO
A lot of people don't like Bratz because they are 'ugly' or whatever but honestly I like Bratz more because they are not that basic and have more style lol. I was laughing the whole time.
Nobody: curtis: body  ody ody ody ody ody
i grew up on bratz movies they were iconic
him reacting to every barbie movie would be pure life essence!
as someone with extremely long hair (past my waist), i can honestly say that as long as you have slack between your scalp and a section, your scalp is fine.  in order for me to brush my hair without feeling tangles, i usually grip my hair a few inches away from my scalp and run my brush through the hair that is loosely gathered underneath; my grasp prevents the pull from traveling to my scalp so long as i have a firm grip.  having a full grown man climb up your hair in a manner like this, though?  mine breaks easily, so i'd love to know what rapunzel uses to keep hers so strong  lmao
I literally had a purple barbie PRINGLE holder😆
That Barbie movie is way worse than I remember it...
looking like a german soccer player from the 90's
fix the stash if u gotta have one
Ok he just had to pick the worst Barbie movie out there like that isn’t fair it’s be fairer if he watched Barbie and the 12 princesses or Barbie and the three musketeers
I was fully convinced the pixie was a witch or some shit.
You should do a collab with oompaville because you look alot like him
What about monster high 😘
Mondo Owada but bratz style. You can’t convince me otherwise
Oh look it’s the virgin
i have a shit life rn but kurtis's videos are the only thing that keep me sane or make me more insane idrk at this point but yeah lets gnome
I’m a big fan of your videos because I like to make fun of movies while I watch them but also don’t have the time to watch everything (nor do I want to make time for that) so I just let you do it. Thanks!
first of all, if my gf sees this comment some day, hey baby yeah im on your account sorry now, for the real comment: i cant stand your intro anymore, is tooooooo long, i hope people let you stop doing it
24:38  “she turned her into a tree” violent percy jackson flashbacks
there are so many better barbie movies than rapunzel, i would’ve at least went with fairy one to correlate with the bratz one
Love u 💕
Okay I'm screaming at the multi layered apology skit
Im so sorry you had to watch these movies for us, your sacrifice would not be in vain :)
I jist foumd your channel like 3 days ago been binging since, i just subscribed, and hit the notification, might not sound like a big deal, but i have like 5 notifications and like maybe 20 subscriptions. You joined Drew Gooden, Maxmoefoe/Coldones and all his channels, Idubbz, Filthy Frank (fingers crossed... In vain lol) and AVGN those are all my notifications. Thank you for the content. Forgot Scott the Woz (hes good if you dont know him check him out y'all)
PENELOPE IS AFRAID OF FLYING GIVE HER A BREAK
Can some one help me get this liked enough for us 90s kids to get Kurtis (we ask humbly) to do a review on the Canadian show I grew up on (though I am American) THE BIG COMFY COUCH 🛋 abouts clowns and all else coolbeans af
😂🤣😆🤣🤣🤣
Kurtis, you look like my fucking father in the 90's
This was on my recommend and I must say, this video did not disappoint.
u literally picked the worst barbie movie i cant breathe
that bratz movie was definitely about drugs and mushrooms
Can we just talk about how amazing the hair styles are in Bratz while Barbie only has like  3
"Do I wanna gnome?" deserves an award
Plot twist They weren’t special glasses, they were just high
"Oh, and Cymbeline is one of them" It was this point I realized that this Bratz movie is basically Lost Boys for kids.
the barbie movies were everything and i liked them better than bratz but I did like the bratz dolls more. pegasus was actually my least favorite movie of barbie, I would pay so much for u to watch all of them
How much would it cost to get you to do stand up in or near LA or Phoenix? I'd happily fund that just to see you live, man!
You should do a video on hallmark movies unless u have already- I’m a new subscriber I know that it like came to Canada in 2018
Bratz fashion pixies was my favorite movie as a kid and I'm so glad someone is appreciating the aesthetic of it and the absolute BANGERS the movie gave us. Also bratz helps so many young girls with their self esteem and was way ahead of its time
Please watch Barbie life in the dream house show. It's amazing!
This is Barbie Fairytopia slander
I’m honestly shocked that no one has mentioned the Barbie movie with the elephant with those scary human eyes. Literal nightmare fuel
This is exactly what I didn’t know I needed to see. 😂🤣😂  Thank you kurtis
I think in general I'm more nostalgic about Barbie movies because I watched a lot of them, but in terms of dolls, games, and overall entertainment, Bratz were my favourite. They were just cooler and more interesting to me. And I really liked the doll design. Also, there is nothing I wouldn't pay for Kurtis to review all these movies.
me and my cousin's named stephan manboob in barbie rapunzel 🙂
Petition to have Kurtis and Cody Ko do a video together 🙋‍♀️
Pls watch the bratz baby movie with the alien potatoes 😭
Okay kurtis boy, we’re gonna have some trouble if you didn’t absolutely love Barbie movies as a kid 😼
Not sure where you got your info but Mattel sued Bratz because the creator of Bratz was a Mattel employee when they came up with the idea (I mean they sued Bratz because they were stiff competition lbr, but that's the excuse they gave in court), and Mattel won. "The jury issued a general verdict (i.e., without specific findings) that MGA wrongfully acquired the ideas and was liable for infringing Mattel's copyright. It awarded Mattel US$100 million."
That crazy gnome guys gave me “adeola wanna roll widda geezer” vibes lmao
Kurtis you need to watch the Barbie and the nutcracker movie not only for the name but also it was my fave Barbie movie
Kurtis Conner I hardly know her
You’re doing yourself a disservice by not watching the live action Bratz the Movie.
Bless you
if you thought this Bratz movie was nuts, you HAVE to watch the tv show. It's chaos.
Kurtis I'm begging you to PLEASE review the other Barbie movies in this fashion
Bratz in general are better but barbie movies are definitely superior
bro u gotta watch mariposa or the mermaid one or fairy
terrified by the choice of barbie movie, much better options sir
Pixie king=dilf
Ya hooo da ba yo
I literally wasn’t allowed to play with Bratz or watch anything related to them lol
Why did the Bratz movies always have so many scary moments
Barbie A Fairy secret reminds me of this bratz movie
Even when I was little I always thought the little kids in Barbie movies looked weird
Kurtis hasn't watched Into the Woods
barbie has better movies and bratz has better dolls
Don’t you dare disrespect Barbie movies.
The angry twerking 😂🤣 I’m dead also Very Really Good is very really good 👍🏻
I wish you didn't choose Barbie as Rapunzel - sadness :'(
Normalize me watching the Barbie movies and loving watching them, because you clearly don't get the point of what the movies mean- (Like I can't even compare Barbie to Bratz one bit, to they are complete different categories and y'all always trying to find a way to compare the shows and make the Barbie fans feel bad)
I love the progression of the mustache in the thumbnails
the animation fucking kills me sjendndkddj
the best part was Arthur <3
No i miss the extra greeting :(
i’m crying this is so funny
when i was a kid i only fucked with the fairy tale bratz movie and the fact that the same gnomes have been used in at LEAST two movies is so unsettling i feel like we don’t know their power
Barbie and the Nutcracker is where it's at my guy
This is my first time ever watching one of your videos and first off that Caddyshack poster is so seggsy great taste, king. Now I may have a bias cause I grew up watching a lot more Barbie movies over Bratz, but like Rapunzel is fr one of the weakest Barbie movies. There are so many that have way more material in them or are just like good, the musicals are usually the strongest.
I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH AN ATTRACTIVE HUMAN BEAN IN ALL MY DAYS WHAT THE FUUUUUUUUU
i know you said you would only watch one of each but you really should watch the barbie movie the 12 dancing princesses. it’s a banger
just unsubscribed.
Just want to ask how many times a day he gets compared to Evan Peters cause the vibes are *strong*
when i was little my sister who was ultra christian and definitely afraid of god at the time told me that god hated brats dollz and i couldn’t even let myself look at commercials of them because i was afraid i would go to hell if i did. so i was a 12 dancing princes type of girl for sure but only as a result of fear mongering
can we add monster high to the lineup???
petition for kurtis to watch the bratz slumber party horror movie
you made me go buy a bratz doll, congrats!! :)))
2:52 That´s not an asshole, that´s Greendale Community College´s flag
Hey Kurtis! Have you ever considered captioning your videos? It would make your videos accessible to d/Deaf and HoH people like myself and unlock a whole new audience for you. YT's automatic captioning system isn't adequate and you have such a big audience now a viewer might even volunteer to do it (as many do for other channels)! I'd be happy to provide some resources on the matter :)
Please make a part 2 to this!!!!!
Barbie has greater movies I think. I only liked Bratz Rock Angels and Genie Magic
(Barbie) Royal high be like:
I loved both but Bratz slightly more. I thought they were cool girls that finally wasn't all about pink stuff
bratz will always be better than barbie idc what anyone says
the men in these movies are SO UGLY HELP
I grew up with Barbie houses and Castles and Cars etc yet I used every doll BUT a Barbie doll and only watched Bratz movies 😂😭 so Bratz win for me Bratz passion 4 fashion and Bratz go to Paris were my 2 favorites
Please show us the hole you’re digging 😂
that is one ugly moustache
Kurtis I got tell you, this one took me out 😭
yes i stole her. But i did not kidnap her she is an object like a lamp because i stole her.
this is so mad i completely forgot that bratz movie existed until now 😭
I feel like My Scene dolls were unfairly left out of this equation
i don't even like harry potter but the "so no hedwig?" joke is absolute golden like we are NOT going to sleep on that are we
I didnt realize until the end of the rapunzel review, but I have a doll i got from McDonald's when I was little and it's barbie as rapunzel and I've had it for at least a decade without knowing
did you just ask repubzel if her pubes are like her hair
very happy you did rapunzel bc it’s def one of my favs but diamond castle would’ve been better it’s ok tho kurtis
he looks so stoned
I totally had those butterfly pixie bratz glasses when I was little but I didn’t remember that at all until rn  Damn that’s wild
This is the best video I've ever seen
Omg you need to watch Fairytopia
literally NO ONE asked for that gnome fire hydrant joke to exist but you made it anyway
not getting my extra greeting  my finger getting closer to the subscribe button
I’m glad kurtis stood up for himself He isn’t what he created!      *unsubscribes*
Bruh why am I subscribed if I no longer get my second greeting?
Kurtis, I swear there's better Barbie movies. Watch "the 13 dancing princesses" or "the diamond castle" (this one is the first wlw children's movie)
As a subscriber, I am outraged at the lack of extra greeting. hahafunnyjoke
Ra *bald* zel
Kurtis was that ”a**” the Greendale logo?
this is incredible i hope he gets all the hot bitches to sub because honestly this is bad bit ch material right here
Omg I remember in 1st grade (in 2000) my best friend at the time got a Bratz doll when they first came out & I was SOOO jealous, I literally started crying 😅
I thought you were flipping us off in that pfp but when I looked closer it was a thumbs up 💀
your mustache looks like two hamsters kissing
Do i wanna ~gnome~
barbie as rapunzel is ENGRAINED into my mind i can't believe i can remember all of this
I would LOVE it if this became a series! Like, if you compared bratz and barbie movies again!
idk how to explain this but kurtis with the mustache looks like kfc. no, not the actual chicken, he just looks like kfc.
Me and my sister grew up on the Barbie movies. We just ranked all of them. The older ones slap.
"Scrotum Scrolls" IS SENDING ME AKSDJAKJDASD
I feel so lucky to have my favourite childhood movie of the bratz be criticized by on of my favourite YouTubers 😂🤣
I love your moustache
I just realized bratz: fashion pixies was the theme of my 6th or 7th birthday but I don’t remember watching it ever
can you do more episode i miss it
I never had a better morning, smoking and watching this u got me wheezing 😭
should have watched diamond castle kurtis
When I tell you my jaw hit the ~floor~ when you said Chalk Zone
It’s so true about Bratz’s representation. My parents always bought me Yasmin and Jade (only for the hair color). I never asked for them or even a specific one and I don’t even remember a Bratz show? I remember the Rock Angelz movie for sure but thats because a cousin of mine had it, I don’t ever remember it being advertised or asking to see it. I never had Chloe or Sasha. Just Jade and Yasmin.
“do i wanna gnome?” gnope
18:44 not me singing the rest of the chorus😭
whyd he pick the 2 worst movies. this was staged he shouldve done barbie as the island princess and bratz passion for fashion diamondz
hes starting to look like Nacho Libre
here's a comment
ya hooo da ba yo
okay but barbie and the 12 princesses is superior
i think the Bratz movie was made into a book because i remember this vividly but i only had the books
WHY DID MY NOT EXTRA GREETING MAKE ME UNCOMFORTABLE TGROUGH OUT THE WHOLE VIDEO.
watch bratz rock angels vs. barbie princess and the paper
kerpes
You have to tour closer to the Midwest! My friends and I would love to see a show!
not me literally thinking you played the Arthur music the first time
As a previous rave-goer with a coke/dope problem, can confirm powder thing. LMAO.
the scientific name for the great horned owl is bubo virginianus
It’s like the celebrity death match claymation tv show. Does anyone knows what I’m talkin bout let me know
I thought I was the only one that remembered chalkzone
When I was little, I used my sister’s Barbie pool playset as a resort for my G.I. Joes to relax at after fighting battles with the evil Cobra. Because even heroic fighting forces need to recharge to stave off PTSD.
My idols: *Monster High, Ever After High, Bratz, Barbie, and Winx Club*
Now do polly pockets vs myscence
This is your best video yet
Kurtis should watched the Bratz movie where the Bratz are babies and turn into superheroes and fight potato monsters. This is a real movie I remember watching every month and day.
PLEASE THE DO I WANNA KNOW JOKE IM CRYING
11:56 trust me on thisz one
16:13 ice age 3?
these 2 movies are such big parts of my childhood this video was perfect
holy shit i had completely forgot that i was really into the movie small soldiers as a kid but rewatching it now the scenes have been imprinted onto my brain i just didnt know what it was from
Also why does every villain in Barbie movies looks like asians:) like literally every villain I find it weird for me of course
Honestly I prefer Bratz more because it has More skin colors and Hair color's and you can find a representation for yourself while Barbie has only (that time only) has a white skin and blonde hair blue other skin color:(
the fact that you actually analyzed a barbie movie kinda has me rolling
18:43 this cracked me up fr
Barbie wire? YOU MISSED OUT ON CALLING IT BARB WIRE
ya hooo da ba yo
GIVE US OUR EXTRA GREETING
9:45 in Into The Woods does! In the broadway version, they have a joke about how it hurts everytime the witch has to climb her hair
ya hooo da ba yo
As a Barbie and Bratz stan (legitimately still collect the dolls and watch the movies on the regular) I do have to say that my favorite boi Kurt doing a video on my queens is such a fulfilling crossover I didn't know I needed.
Most Barbie movies and the barbie dream house series were the shiaaaaat not like their dolls :v but bratz dolls were poppinnn and bratz movies and stuff were 🤡
Kurtis looking like the original singer from STYX
I use to LOVE the way their footsteps sounded….like I found them so satisfying growing up.
please make this a series
18:43 what the fuck,   I literally just finished editing and uploading a video about the "Do I Wanna Know" song, like, a minute before this joke happened.   Literally meaningless but it still gave me a start 😳
Kurtis should’ve watched Barbie princess and the pauper
the graphics for the barbie movie literally pains me  it looks like it was made in blender with a 500 dollar budget and 489 dollars of it was spent on crack for the animators dont even get me started on that fall animation
the so no hedwig joke made me laugh way more than it shouldve
big steve buscemi energy
I'd love to see Kurtis check out the movie "Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation" , watched it a whole bunch when I was a kid. It's such a strange movie, feels like a fever dream half the time.
wtf now we need monster high vs ever after high next
Princess Charm School is THE BEST BARBIE MOVIE HANDS DOWN. Just thought Id say that.
Ya hooo da ba yo
11:37 exactly like make no since
i cant believe you CHOSE not to give an extra greeting. What is even the point of being subscribed anymore?? ;-; ;-;
i think because i only watched barbie as a kid that's why i like them more (also the best barbie movies are hands down princess and the pauper and twelve dancing princesses)
bless you
the real horniest weasel is hort from sge
Out of every Barbie movie he chose Rapunzel??? Not Princess and The Pauper???? 12 Dancing Princesses???? Come on Kurtis. Do better.
ok but 18:12
I just had intense flashbacks of watching that Barbie movie when I was younger
Aw man it would’ve been better if you did “Barbie and the Rockers go to space”. They had an Asian, a ginger and a black woman......but no Hispanic/Latino*sob*. Still an amazing and underrated movie. Awesome songs too.
u have no idea how many times i did that weird small exhale laugh through my nose during the duration of this you have made my dreams come true ty
I grew up with Bratz!
Hedwig is like super crazy 😜
I want my extra greeting. Mayor is a hard and tedious job, but I love ya for it.
Also, wanted to make this a separate comment, but my whole life I've always enjoyed avant-garde things in just about every category... even girls' dolls it seems. I didn't have any Barbies or Bratz. I did, however, just about buy my local Toys'R'Us out of their Polly Pockets. I fucked with those heavy for some reason unbeknownst to me.
I mean, I had the Season 1 Digivice as a kid and would hold it up to my computer screen while I watched Digimon in hopes that I would actually get sucked into the Digital World. We all did some shit like that as kids and if you say otherwise, you're lying to yourself.
ya hooo da ba yo
Im gonna need reoccurring episodes of this it’s such a trip down memory lane
Liked at “do I wanna gnome” 😂😂
Omg I might as well unsubscribe if I don’t get benefits anymore
dislike because it hurt my feelings you purposefully didnt give me my special extra greeting 😢😔
Lol and then me with my scenes
React to blue mountain state! It’s a show on spike I think and it’d make great content plz check it out
fashion pixies can not be beat
That weasel moans like that guy who makes “The bully has a crush on you” TikTok videos
forever diamondz and rock angelz were my favorite bratz films growing up
Barbie fairytopia is good too!!!!
how can i not subscribe after *”do i wanna gnome”*
Man I have been big sad for a while now and this video made me laugh so thank u 🙏🏻
u didnt even watch the good good barbie movies
the fact that I actually watched the Bratz movie and completely blocked it out. This video awakened old memories
Me waiting for the “chipper, I hardly know her”….. it never happened
Rapunzel is bald now
This was literally that best video I’ve ever watched
Safe to say, I remembered the quality of the Barbie movies completely different
You’ve seen Brats,you’ve seen Barbie…BUT have you seen MYSCENE?!?! Those dolls + movie SLAPPED.
Kurtis being terrified of the children in the barbie movie kills me the- AaAaAhHhHHhHhHhHhHh
Ra-pun-zel is bald now 🎶 is never going to get out of my head
I am so offended and insulted that the Barbie movie our beloved boy watched Rupunzle instead of Mariposa, Mermadia, or mf PRINCESS AND THE PAUPER. I’m genuinely gonna cry. Fuck man
Your Al just a bunch of pip sqeaqs playing with plastic. The one kid with a solid gold Spiderman figure
You see! You see why he is THE mayor!! For sheetz like this
PLS do monster high I'm begging
“a valued member of kurtis town” yet we dont get our promised extra greeting ?!
i fucking love this video😭
I feel like Kurtis should take a look at Wondershowzen
ALL I WANT TO KNOW IS WHICH ONE LOOKS BETTER IN A JAR
Brats fashion pixies is just barbie and a fairy secret
NO EXTRA GREETING WHAT?
guys i think hes not a virgin
Can’t believe you didn’t review Bratz Rock Angelz or Bratz Genie Magic. Arguably the top tier Bratz media
when i was little, i remember watching the bratz kidz sleep over adventure and i was terrified of it. i legit thought it was a horror movie 😭✋
Pls watch Bratz Rock Angelz Mr. Mayor
As Bratz and Barbie fan myself I say, bless you for letting Bratz win…now if only they won that lawsuit :(
6:23 the fact that a Christian ad came up lol
Biggest plot hole in the Bratz movie: a child is riding a motorcycle to school?
Noooo you have to watch the Princess and the Pauper!!!!
Scrolltums
Please talk about the bts Army!!!
I keep wanting to double tap the screen every 5 seconds Bc I’m zooted and think I’m on tiktok😂 this video is so funny! Thank you Kurtis!
Damn, this video makes me miss bratz dolls. I absolutely loved those as a kid.
"do thy carpets match the drapes" PLS IM DYING😭😭😭
you've been angrily twerking for like half of the heights
ok its not even a contest the bratz movie singlehandedly made me a bratz fan. i never had the chance bc i was a tiny lesbian who rejected girly things but i'm smarter now. THE GOTH PIXIE RAVE?!?!
KURITS PLS. I HAVE AN IDEA. WATCH THE LOWEST RATED MOVIE FROM BARBIE, BRATZ, MONSTER HIGH, ETC. AND TELL US WHAT YOU THINK. BY GOD ALMIGHTY MULLET MUSTACHE PLS KURTIS DO THIS
the scene of him replicating the angry twerking girl REALLY took me off guard
thank fck u skipped that extra greeting we have been waiting for u to relinquish ur chains and be free
I SUBSCRIBED ONLYYY FOR THE ECTRA GREETING AT THE BEGGINING OF EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOUR VIDEOS. now I’ve been fooled for the second time :(
Ok, now do monster high
The way that Bratz Rock Angelz was not chosen is 😩😩😩
Barbie rapunzel is one of my absolute favorite childhood movies and I feel like he did it SO dirty. Hilariously... but dirty.
Penelope was afraid of heights-  that's why they couldn't use her to just fly and escape in the earlier parts of the movie. Pls dont come for her
can someone count how many times he says barbie in this video?
Guys it’s definitely not virgin. It’s virgina
i have a movie you should react to called ivan the incredible that movie literally ruined my day you should watch it
Okay but your next movie review should be CarGo it’s on YouTube And the channel it’s on is called family central
bless you
Kurtis if u review a barbie movie that isn't a musical, ur a virgin, Checkmate.
Obviously bratz are better😭🤷🏽‍♀️
I always that they stood for Virgo, and I really thought u was a Virgo 😭😂
bless you
This is not why I subscribed!!! The extra greeting was so nice and now he’s treating us like he’s ready for a divorce
Where is my extra greeting I am owed this 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
dont take this wrong but- why do people hate mondays?
he should have watched 12 dancing princesses smh
I feel like this was a little unfair, there are definitely better Barbie movies
The pixie world = shroom trip
21:41 fucking sent me 🤣
Idk bout y'all but Bratz movies and series a were always creepy af to me
gothel looks like tall girl
this was one of my favorite bratz movies too.
Omg it’s Kelly never mind 🙄
bratz movies feels like a fever dream and i love it
i loved the rapunzel movie bitch
8:00 he honestly did nail *oUr vOiCE*
14:28 damn I didn’t know Repunzal had gravity defying hair
im now gonna marathon every barbie movie (up until the ones released after 2014) because I wanna relive my childhood
I was completely obsessed with fashion dolls, and all of their movies as a kid. And out of them all, Monster High was my favorite. I loved how they mixed the horror aesthetic and the girly/feminine aesthetic so seamlessly.
This video had me laughing an unhealthy amount
NOOO I NEED MY EXTRA GREETING AAAAAa
ya hoo da ba yo
Bald Rapunzel= Mr world wide
i’m actually upset ab the extra greeting
kurtis you're wrong.
i legit thought sigourney weaver was a fictional zoologist in finding dory ngl
why is no one talking abt the james charles apology reference when he says "i didnt mean it im desperate" ?
K now do the monster high ones
KELLY i thought her name was CHELSEA
i’ve been on a social media break so i haven’t watched your videos in a month or 2. i come back and they’re iNCREDIBLE. work of art😗👌🏻
#cancelkirtfornotgivingusanextragreeting #vrgstandsforvirginandkirtisavirgin
ya hooo da ba yo
I love every joke you make kurtis. Every joke. I mean it.
I feel betrayed. Why didnt i get an extra greeding sir. I'd like a refund
scrotum scrolls
Knome pissing joke was a flop
Part2 with Barbie In Princess and the Pauper vs Bratz Rock Angelz
10:56 "give him to mee, OUUGH"
Honestly, the best part of this video that I keep coming back to and can't stop laughing about is the girl angrily twerking and Kurtis imitating it. I literally can't--
the angry twerking has me dying lol
oh my god please watch some of the monster high movies!!!!!!! also you messed up not watching the 12 dancing princesses ;(
dude the creator of bratz got exposed for being a racist lmfao
21:26😭😂
my CHILDHOOOOOOOOOD  Edit: did you grow up in the 00s if crappily animated films with weird music-less sequences weren’t the norm? I’m looking at you, pollyworld  If you watch more of these films, bratz rock angelz, and barbie in princess and the pauper and the fairytopia trilogy are the most iconic ones imo (for barbie films stick to pre-2008, they’re all p iconic)
The bad guy in the Bratz movie looks like Onision :|
president of the NAV [Not A Virgin] movement
16:30 Missed a Harvey Weinstein joke opportunity
ya hooo da ba yo
He literally chose my two favourite films for the dolls!
should’ve watched barbie fairytopiamermaidia
WHERE IS MY GREETING
Only virgins don’t give extra greetings
I thought it was “verga”  Y pues que bueno que no jajajajaja
omfg u unlocked some memories watching the pixies. that was my fav bratz movie and i remember crying to it because of the endless mommy issues.
As a barb I strongly disagree. We were set up for failure. You should’ve done Barbie princess and the pauper!!! REMATCH REMATCH REMATCH
i feel like this wasnt an even competition😭  pixiez was like its all over the place lmao. please do smth like bratz rock angelz or bratz genie magic vs princess and pauper
I've been dying since you started talking and now my stomach hurts thank you I needed this.
hay day??
i know Kurtis is sick of that extra greeting lmfao
Ngl when I was a kid I loved that Barbie as rapunzel movie so much yet I always fuckin hated Kelly
Barbie didn't have any competition...? 🤔  Uhhhh... *_Sindy?!?_* Barbie's biggest competitor before Bratz.
so the gnome in the bratz movie is the most accurate representation of an irish person i've ever seen in a non-irish movie.
Next you should watch a monster high movie, top tier films
If you need another movie to react to: Cinderella 3 A Twist In Time is a wild iconic rollercoaster
Ok kurtis you vrg 😒
Ruth Handler, the creator, originally made and designed Barbie and Ken after her own children, Barbara and Kenneth. They are both blonde and blue eyed because her son and daughter were blonde and blue-eyed. It's not that they were not being inclusive to other skin colors or looks lol.
This needs to be a series
Are we not going to talk about the dragons creepy human-like hands
Unsubscribing can’t believe I didn’t get my second greeting… Oh how the greats have fallen 🤦‍♂️
ya hooo da ba yo
you shouldve watched barbie and the diamond castle
See how she wraps the hair around the pillar first? If you hold your hair tight enough at the top, you don’t feel a brush going thru it towards the bottom. It’s the same thing, the pillar serves to tighten the hair, hypothetically, so she’s okay
This is monster high erasure
Flying unicorn??? I think you mean 𝒶𝓁𝒾𝒸𝑜𝓇𝓃.   Please educate yourself 😠😠😠
You are Emma chamberlain but with curly hair
they arent even unrealistic porpotions for a bratz doll 😭😭 having big lips and lightly big eyes isn't uncommon
i loved bratz as a kid, most of my dolls and films were bratz over barbies. I think a large part of the appeal for a lot of kids is there was more (though still fairly limited) diversity with bratz dolls than with barbies
he pointed out the "vrg" and my brain went "vergina" which isn't the correct spelling or pronunciation but okay brain
i can't believe you didn't say "scrolltum"
barbie in the movie: "BALLZ"
Umm was anyone else freaked out by bald Kurtis
🚨🚨KURTIS TAKING CONTROL🚨🚨💯💯💯
finally someone else who remembers chalk zone omg
18:45 cannot stop thinking abt this segment
How dare you not give us a double greeting
Why the fuck are all the Bratz pixies so emo
Okay but him choosing Rapunzel was the first mistake
Make video about @patriarchal_phenomenon on instagram
THE BRATZ MOVIE BROUGHT BACK SO MUCH OF MY CHILDHOOD THAT FUCKING MOVIE ALWAYS SCARED ME
only virgins skip the extra greeting
I don't know why the sneeze at the end cracked me up so much 😂
you remind me so much of drew gooden
scrotum scrolls > elder scrolls
This man knows his audience content. Love the not usual greeting! POWER
barbie rapunzel is a 15/10 movie 8 year old me won't stand for this slander
Bless your soul sir
Barbie as Rapunzel has so many good meme moments I was so glad it was the first one
ok
i was never introduced to bratz so barbies got a pretty strong hold on me
the bratz fashion pixies single-handedly shaped my entire personality and who I am as a person
8:30
Brb gonna go to the bathroom
8:57 uhm aCtuALly Hedwig is a girl
You should have watched 12 dancing princesses!! And Bratz sleepover!!
that gnome has the best Cork accent I've ever heard in an American movie. Fair play bratz, I guess?
Petition for kurtis react to princess and the pauper!!!
Oh my god. Barbie Rapunzel was my absolute favorite. I had it on VHS and would watch it over and over
Kurtis looks like my fifth grade teacher and I just keep having flashbacks
ya hooo da ba yo
7:24 TOOK ME OUTT I CAN'T
I randomly came across your vids and I'm in love??????????
I feel so bad that he picked objectively the worst of the classic Barbie movies. Barbie as Rapunzel is just... Just so bad. Granted I loved both as a kid and the Bratz stuff doesn't get enough love, so I'll give it pass, but Barbie Swanlake was my jam. I hadn't watched it in over a decade, recently watched it with my friend in a Barbie marathon and it still slaps. (We were high when we watched rapunzel and that was trip.)
Petition for Kurtis to make a video about the doll customising/ repaint community
POV: this is the first video of his you’ve watched 🤨😂
as someone named kelly, it was uh... interesting to hear my name followed by a bunch of insults LOL
Hey anyone notice he didn’t do the bonus intro
Bratz just had more sass and taking their feet off? Genius.
You picked the wrong Barbie movie.
VRG is my initials 😂😂
Is it just me or does one of the kings in the barbie movie look kinda like hagrid?
MATTEL ME THAT!!
barbie deserved better, but monster high movies are the real best for sure 😤
unpopular opinion but barbie life in the dreamhouse > barbie movies
the horny weasel ends sentences the same way trisha paytas does
You literally chose one of the worst Barbie movies man, they’re are good ones man
fire hydrants are gnomes with piss kinks?
The Barbie books made me feel so nostalgic omg
ya hooo da ba yo
wow kurtis i’m unfollowing for the intentional not getting an extra greeting /j
I had the fucking pixies bratz dolls. But I never knew this movie existed. 😂 I lost their wings in about 3 seconds but their hair was gorgeous.
Slay
This guy tries to copying seamus gorman and caitlin mckillop 'bout barbie movies' videos but it's okay who likes out of context
u didnt give barbie a fair chance, u shouldve watched one of the better ones (aka fairytopia, mermaidia, barbie and the diamond castle, etc) 😭😭
Did anyone else have Moxie Girl dolls as a kid instead of Bratz, or was that just me? My mom always got us Moxies instead of Bratz because she said the Bratz were creepy (to be fair, she was right) and they were more pg For reference, Moxies were basically just Bratz with less makeup and really brightly colored hair and clothes. Their feet still popped off, but they had much smaller lips and for the most part just looked like basic white girls
Barbie is timeless meaning her age could be anything brats is for teenagers
I don't remember a lot of Bratz movies despite watching several, however Barbie and he Diamond Castle was a very big part of my childhood and probably why I'm gay now tbh. Look me in these eyes and tell me those two weren't cottage core lesbians.
This is one of Kurtis's funniest videos
bratz was always my fav
Ya hooo da ba yo
kurtis i'm gonna cry bc you didn't do the extra greeting ty
Bruh Rapunzel is like one of the worst Barbie movies
the way he refers to the main bratz girls as “the friends” 😭
You should watch the bratz sleepover movie
Memories unlocked
WATCH PRINCESS AND THE PAUPER YOU WILL NOT BE (AS) DISAPPOINTED I PROMISE!! THE MUSICALS ARE THE BEST BARBIE MOVIES!!!
man the ChalkZone theme song still slaps
disliking for no extra greeting you bucket of piss
Confused as to why that dancing in Bratz wasn't enough for you to give it a zero. Barbie has a makeover scene so automatic winner.
he chose the literal best movies from each one. iconic
NEWS FLASHHHH PENELOPE COULDN"T FLY THAT WAS HER WHOOOOOOLE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT duhhhhhh
Penélope can't take barbie out of the tower because she's afraid of flying 😭😭😂😂😂
Ok is the mustache actually fake
bro not choosing barbie princess and the pauper??? unbelievable.
bratz movie walked so killer bean could run
Didn’t get my extra greeting, unsubscribed. Who’s in control now pretty boy 🙂
I disliked because there was no extra greeting. #karen #girlboss
Bruh I haven't watch a video that's made me laugh this much in such a long time. I literally watched this vid all the way through no pausing or distractions. 🙌🙌 Incredible
My replika AI loves watching your videos
The fucking nostalgia in all of this 🤣 I’m 24. I watched the same exact Barbie movie featured in this video. I’ve watching a couple Bratz movies, but I don’t recall ever seeing this one. The main one I remember is the genie magic movie from 2006. I loved that shit, lmao
where the heck is my extra greeting kurtis
cancelled.
ya hooo da ba yo!
The bratz gamecube games tho!!
I have a big forehead Kurtis. My nickname when I was little used to be " tweety" cuz of my bloonde hair and my forehead ✨😔🙏(👽)
Barbie movies slapped tho, the older ones
Bratz dolls are NOT better than barbie. At all.    Many people seem to think they’re allowed to express the opinion that Bratz dolls are better than Barbie dolls. This is simply false in every way. Some like to make the argument that Bratz dolls are more fashionable and have better bodies than barbie. Bratz dolls outfits are just all over the place. Detachable feet? You HAVE to remove their feet entirely just to change their shoes? That’s terribly bad design. Barbie is allowed to go barefoot whenever she pleases, making her much more realistic. Barbies outfits are clean, and appealing to the eyes.    I believe that this opinion of Bratz dolls superiority over Barbie stems from people’s need to feel different, and unique. Its no lie that Barbie is much more successful than Bratz dolls, and for good reason too. Thinking that Bratz dolls are better is barbaric and uncivilized. I haven’t even gotten through half of the reasons why Barbie is better.   Another example for why Barbie reigns superior over Bratz is her contribution to society as a positive role-model for children, especially young girls. Barbie has had over 200 careers, making her an inspiration to girls as a whole. Even if Bratz dolls were more fashionable and physically appealing than Barbie, they would still not have left such a mark on society as Barbie has. That is because Bratz dolls value only money, while Barbie values change, progress, and representation. Barbie slander is not morally right, and frankly, its egregious.    A Bratz doll is but a shell of a little girl; though Barbie is an all-powerful being in the vessel of a woman.
I need Kurtis to review the Barbie version of Swan Lake
why is no one talking about the arctic monkeys reference i literally cannot breathe 💀
Kelly had better watch out for those 187,000 holes she's about to fall into
King Wilhelm huh? I wonder where they got that from
What is up with the creepy 80s porno look Kutis is sporting?
THE PERFECT GIRL                                   but she has constant diarrhea anyone know that toy?
18:54 so nobody's gonna talk about his fingernails? They're so cool wth
Who ever disliked this video is some real ass holes
8:44 That's it, you basically describe the furry fandom
i would love rapunzel is bald now as a full song lol
I wanna rewatch this when I get high
🎵rapunzel is bald now! 🎵
ya hooo da ba yo
the best barbie movie out there is the horse riding one and nothing can convince me otherwise.
8:23 Oblivion NPCs
Monster High and Ever After High are so much better but I still loved bratz and barbies
Woooooo  Hello Kurtis, it’s nice to see you. I started listening to very really good podcast and it is great I’m on episode 5
where tf is my second greeting
NOT THE JAMES CHARLES REFERENCE LMAOOOOOO
wow I totally forgot about chalk zone!!
To everyone, ILY and you matter
There's this mini series called "The 10th kingdom" which includes a sort of remake of the Rapunzel hair climbing sequence, and that character is like screaming in pain the whole time. So much more realistic
i’m sure this has been commented, but the dragon was scared to fly for the beginning of the movie so that’s why it didn’t happen till the end haha. but i highly recommend Princess and The Pauper, it’s the best Barbie movie by far.  and you HAVE to watch the Bratz Baby Sleepover movie, that one is wild  (if you could make a part 2)
I just realized how similar Barbie as Rapunzel and Tangled are😭😭
The pixies can show themselves whenever they want. The glasses don't give them the choice fyi
My apatite will not be sated until Kurtis posts another video. I literally cannot live without our Mayor's videos. For now until Kurtis posts another video I sit here in the church of gamers feeling so not poggers.
Is her name  really Lena or is it actually Ebon D'arkness Dementia Raven Way
why does kelly look like a walmart jimmy neutron
Could a virgin have that moustache? Yes
havent seen this yet but bratz vetter win or else you’re a virgin
i cant see u the same, where is the extra greeting. are we not important. 😞🥺
I hated the chase scene as a kid it always made me really uncomfortable but I never knew why. It was the lack of music 🤣
Why does dylan look like Evan and Levi's love child
WHAT ABOUT MONSTER HIGH DOLLARS KURTIS!!!!
Love the Camero mullet, dude 🤗
Kurtis made me remember that ChalkZone existed
You should watch Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper I think you would like it
The bratz soundtrack is sooo good !! Its empowering without being vulgar.. Also the singers are really good .
Bratz dolls are cool and all but Barbie did movies WAY better
My thumb disintegrated from how fast I clicked on this video.
10:21 she CAN'T fly up really high, that's the whole point
“ scrotum scroll” 😂😂😂
Okay Bratz movie is gonna be the best drunk movie ever lamo
POLY POCKETS FOR THE WIN
You know there’s hard working YouTubers make movies or shows in the game sims I swear they make it wayyyyyy more better than this Barbie weed movie
Please review the movie Love on a Leash. I think you'll have feelings about it
kurtis even tho i miss the extra greeting, i respect ur decision to omit it ✊😔
ya hooo da ba yo
I'm still shocked I actually enjoyed all this as a kid.
please tell me someone else remembers the bratz babies movie where the twins lost their puppy in the mall and then had to win a singing contest to get the dog back
Yesssss Chalk Zone !
Are we not going to talk about how horrendously ugly the baby bratz are 19:57
KURTIIISSSSS YOU MISSSSED SUCH A HUGE PART OF THE BRATZ SENSATION!!! BRATZ BABIEZ!!!
i’m sorry but nothing will come close to barbie life in the dreamhouse 😌
When i saw Bratz, i didnt like them because of their clothing..
I preferred bratz dolls but preferred Barbies movies,,, also monster high supremacy <3
NOT THE JAMES CHARLES APOLOGY Lol
Who else is disappointed Kurtis didn't watch the one barbie movie about the lesbians?
Hmmmm no extra greeting? Guess I have no reason to be subscribed anymore, it’s a damn shame.
7:33 your one chance to make kelly not look like what stubbing your toe feels like Not even joking this made me laugh so hard
I can’t believe kurtis watched the classic BEST ones like bratz genie magic or barbie the Christmas carol or the 12 dancing princesses. That shit is SO GOOD
"And I gotta say, right off the bat, Kelly is a goddamn nightmare to look at" 😂💀
i just watched a 30 minute video where kurtis ruined my childhood films-
omg the "BAAALLLLSS" sound from Barbie has GOT to be a recurring sound on this channel xD kills me every time
Let’s start a riot and boycott Kurtis until he gives us that fucking extra greeting
Ok the barbie movies are better, but the bratz clothes and dolls are better
I feel you (Kurtis) have to watch all of the Barbie & Brats movies. Not us, so don't show it. But just make a video where you break down & give a serious review of each movie. Also, you were great in Stranger Things.
21:57  probably one of my favorite kurtis conner videos just because of that scene
review a polly pocket movie + more barbie movies
is this cheese sandwich from mlp?
barbie rapunzel: "i love you" "i don't" "fuck you, stole ya baby, lol byeee"   B҉ ҉  A҉ ҉  L҉   ҉L҉   ҉S҉
My fav Barbie movie
Bratz fashion pixies was my sexual awakening ngl
princess charm school should have been the barbie movie
Idk why but I need you to do Princess and the Pauper vs. Rock Angelz, you would love the Tweevils
NO BC YOU CHOSE MY FAVORITE BRATZ MOVIE
PRINCESS AND THE PAUPER RIGHTS
bless you kurtis !!
I’ve always preferred bratz, I’ve loved the diversity and girlboss energy but when it comes to the holiday barbies they release every year UGH in love with them
shit, this reminded me that I had Penelope as a toy who could talk and flutter her wings when I was really young. also eternally disappointed that Kurtis chose Rapunzel over the Nutcracker, I feel like the latterwas the best one.
Ok, but you should do monster high vs ever after high     just sayin 🤷‍♀️
Fun fact: the Stephen doll was used in Hannah Montana for the Robby Ray doll, they just added a mullet to it
I like the bar you spit at 4:25 , but you should have come up with a second one. So you can compare bar A with bar B
ya hooo da ba yo
U should do a video for myscene as well :3 they have a movie hehe
What about My Scene dolls though? Their movies slap
Matellme that...Im dead
im praying you watch the bratz scary stories movie bc it is SO funny
Tell me you grew up in the 2000’s *without* telling me
Both films are actually iterations of the classic foundling narrative, characterized by “tokens” given by parents before estrangement, a reunion scene, and a different social position based on this reunion!
ok but monster high tho
I hate to say it but “do I wanna gnome” is my favorite joke.
it’s not a uNiCoRn WiTh wInGs, kurtis, it’s called an ALICORN 😤😤😤😤 get it TOGETHER, MAN ‼️‼️‼️‼️
The most inaccurate part of this video is Kurtis misgendering Hedwig.
Dude I loved Barbie Rapunzel but the Nut Cracker one was AMAZING & hands down my fav growing up.  Missed opportunity for the Bratz movie tho bc this one fkn sucked lmao def should’ve went w/ Rock Angelz.  I played the shit outta the Rock Angelz game on PS2.
As a little girl I was NEVER interested in dolls (except how far I could throw them) until Bratz showed up.
Oreo Barbie
this is the video i didn't know i needed. my favorite youtuber wrecking one part of my childhood and bumping another, this made my damn day 💀
Im so offended. I didnt even get my extra greeting. Seriously considering unsubscribe. Much disappointment.
growing up my grandparents had barbie as rapunzel on vhs and I was obsessed!!! still kind of love it
You had to review that bratz’s movie!!! You should’ve done bratz’s rock angels!!!
Good vid!! Do one on Monster High x Ever After High and how the company teased a crossover but then canceled EAH.
You should definitely see bratz rock angelz next! AMAZING MOVIE !! you won't regret it
I think this is his funniest video yet, guys
What about black pink wtf smh for real for real on a stack on a buck 50 omg
kurtis you should have watched the barbie diaries its literally on youtube, not bad tbh
I wanna see kurtis react to bratz super babies
They said they CHOOSE when they want to be seen duh 🥱🙄
Fashion Pixies was my FAVORITE bratz movie growing up. It did create an unrealistic expectation for parties tho. I have seen not one aggressively angry twerker 😔
NOT THE JAMES CHARLES REFERENCE
I have never wanted anyone more than I want him to react to Jesus Christ vampire hunters, the full movie is free on YouTube. I think I could die happy then 😌
IM CRYING AT THE IRISH GNOME SAYING “it’s time ye noisy cailínís” PLSS
17:33 im crying
Kurtis, I cannot believe you like Bobby Flay he is my mortal enemy I will not sleep well tonight knowing he is alive
It seems Kelly might have scared you away forever but if you’re gonna dive in the Barbie universe again try Barbie in the Nutcracker! It’s got a great soundtrack, fight scenes, lots of dancing and no horny weasels (and i feel like you can do a lot more w nutcracker than w balls).
21:27
This was the most hilarious thing I’ve seen in a while… yep. Subscribing💙💎
KURTISS, I know its not the season for christmas movies but consider this, The Dog Who Saved Christmas, the movie is just.. weird you know something good for a video I think(and if you dont wanna make a video about it I could always go over to drews comment section and give him the idea)
And now you have to watch, what is in my opinion, the best Barbie movie and the worst bratz movie: Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper, and Bratz: Super Babyz
no more extra greetings???
To simmer it down. I'd feel like I had the personality of Barbie but my appearance is a Bratz😃
why are you pitting two bad bitches against each other?
PLEASE WATCH ANOTHER BARBIE MOVIE I'm dying to see your reaction
Moreeeee!
Bartz was good at entertainment; best friendship gang, fun characters and comedy. Barbie was aesthetically pleasing, compelling stories and cool transformal dress up scene along with the music
If Kurtis knew "vrg" is the abreviation for "verga", which means dick in spanish. Oh boi
Stefan's hands fit around barbie's WHOLE waist are u kidding me
There's a Barbie as Rapunzel game too. You're fixing up rooms and at the end of each room you need to find a jewel with a magnefying glass. We'd always put it on Barbies face. Good times. Would recommend.
I am DYING laughing at the apology video oh my god how is no one else talking about it
Should have used a later Barbie movie like Island Princess, Princess and the Pauper or 12 Dancing Princesses 💁‍♀️
That devilish moment when you enjoy the second greeting without subscribing and it backfires
Fun fact: My mother always hated Barbie's proportions and as a kid always explained to me that real women don't and i shouldn't believe they look like that. I had a lot of Bratz dolls and those were my favourite ;)
I love how you watched this entire movie about pixies and evil pixies who fly around and put people in dance trances and the thing that you decided to deem unrealistic was the fact that the people at the rave didn’t try to snort the powder out of the air as it fell.
He should of watched bratz sleepover party and Barbie Mermaidtopia 😤
Where is my extra greeting?
Why are all the Bratz outfits so good😭
I have such vivid memories to this specific barbie movie gajdhdj
does thou carpets match thy drapes was the end of me
DOTH THY CARPET MATCH THY DRAPES
The king didn’t marry gothel because she got sent so many ball scrolls
I’m upset for obvious reasons.. this is unacceptable kurtis.. I did NOT subscribe for this... I demand an extra greeting at once or I may need to renegotiate our agreement 👀
Kurtis‼️‼️ Are you willing to come around to Tacoma WA again in your tour? I couldn't get tickets last time around 😭😔
SO basically I was calling my Bratz Barbie for last 17 years 🐸
I love you lmfao, your videos always sends me
Gothle looks like Alaska lmao
6:36 WHEN I TELL U I CACKLED SO FUCKIN HARD 💀💀💀
Ya hooo da ba yo😂
please review rock angelz it changed the music industry as we know it
This is one of those episodes you can hang in the hall of fame long before voting begins.
Extra greeting :(
Idk I kinda needed that extra greeting
As someone with a big forehead , my heart aches
wood chipper? i hardly know her
This is One of your best videos
Dude watching this video fucking UNEARTHED so many memories
since kurtis owns that stache the dad jokes are out of control
mattel me that
Top quality content Kurtis. You're at the top of your game buddy.  Also, nice try.. we all know vrg means virgin.
I WILL NOT ALLOW THIS BARBIE SLANDER
I think Quentin Tarantino should have won the Oscar for horniest weasel
Best Brats movie ever. The only one I’ve watched, the only one I will.
I thought Skipper is Barbie's sister? I didn't know she had more than one.
Both are iconic but I have to go bratz on this one
wait till he watch the Barbie Diaries
This video ended up unlocking a deep memory from the vault of my mind and I just need to share it: So when I was really little someone had given me this Barbie coloring book that was also a story book-- I don't remember any of the actual plot or anything but all that's important was that the man who was Barbie's love interest nearing the end was revealed to be her long lost brother. But in the end, they still.got.fucking.married.  I distinctly remember going to my mom and having her read it through again, and I hadn't misinterpreted it or anything. Barbie deadass hooked up with her brother. Now i desperately need to know if anyone ever read this book too. I can't be the only one who remembers the Barbie incest book
How could people think this guy is a virgin? He's cute as heck
This whole video reinforces the fact that we cannot trust a mans opinion... FIRST of all, these two movies are INCOMPARABLE. It wouldn't even been fair as they have two completely different plots! SECOND, Barbie as Rapunzel was made 5 years before Bratz Fashion Pixiez... he completely overlooks how amazing the animation was in Barbie Rapunzel for the time! If he wanted a more fair and realistic movie lineup to judge by he should have gone for Barbie Fairytopia or Barbie: A Fairy Secret VS Bratz Fashion Pixiez instead. However, if he wanted a summation of best/ most iconic of each franchise he should have gone for Barbie Princess and The Pauper VS Bratz Rock Angelz. This is why we shouldn't trust men to speak. Do better.
Next up is monster high vs ever after high.
Now you should compare MyScene, Polly Pocket and Moster High to get a glimpse of the girly world we got on the Internet back in the day. MyScene's movie was good in my opinion, when I was 9 years old.
Short story about why dolls are important: My dad literally brought me a Bratz doll and I didn't even watch a lot of Bratz episodes but he did it because he said she had brown hair like me and now I understand that he was trying for me to have representation. Since I have brown hair and tan skin, it was difficult to find a barbie with brown hair of course, so my mum had to buy me a Rachel (but I think she is asian?). The thing is that both my parents tried to show me some representation through the dolls and the closest they get was the Bratz doll, and it was important for me honestly, I never use my blonde barbie again. I'm so sorry Barbie I always ended up putting Ken up with the tan Bratz and she was the single rich girl 😂
Owls don't have penises, so it is, in fact, impossible for an owl to give another owl hedwig.
I loved the Barbie movies but the Bratz dolls were deffinetly my fave. I loved Barbie too but it was only the princess ones that I got, with Bratz there was more to choose from since they weren't bound to ONE style of fashion like good ol' Barbie was. Brats could be girly, punk, goth, casual, hell I remember never taking my Kimono Jade out of her box because she was so pretty.  While Barbie is forever, it took her a bit too long to get on the diversity train, but I'm happy that we're here now. Still miss the Bratz though.
I SWEAAAAR I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY KID WHO HAS EVER SEEN CHALK ZONE THANK YOU
Now that you pointed it out, Bratz is kinda better due to how their body is SO UNREALISTIC a girl couldn't really aspire to look like one. With Barbie it's so close to looking real that you think you can be healthy and look like a Barbie doll. Plus like you said Bratz had more skin colors, and, colors in general. Hair and eye as well.
Scroll-tum Kurtis cmon
The “do i wanna gnome” absolutely gave me whiplash bc going 🎶 do i wanna know 🎶 at every given moment when i do NOT want to know is sth I’ve been doing for the past seven years, wtf kurtis???
3:39 COMEDY GOLD
8:57 What's the background song?
Barbie and the nutcracker and bratz starin n stylin are the best
2:53 & 21:58 lol
ya hooo da ba yo
9:05 so no head-wig?
"so no hedwig??" PLEAAASE
u had the opportunity to call it barbwire..not barbiewire smh homie
MERMAID TALE 2 IS THE BEST BARBIE MOVIE EVER  ARGUE WITH THE WALL
i think kurtis calling a bratz movie a “film” will make some film majors mad
Kurtis PLEASE do a video about Aaron Carter!! Dude's a living YIKES. (Kurtistown citizens, PLEASE like this so Kurtis can see!)
Okay so I miss my extra greeting. It genuinely made me feel more comfortable.
So as someone with very long hair i can offer some clarification here. she might have actually not felt it because her hair is tied around that bannister, and the bannister is probably taking the weight. sometimes my hair is very tangled and i have to hold it at the scalp level while pulling the brush through the tangles. i don’t feel it because i am already holding my hair, so the pull comes at the part where i’m holding it instead of my scalp. i’m not sure if i’m correct because my hair is only about a foot and a half to two feet long but it makes sense from a physics standpoint i think (i never fully learned physics i had to teach myself)
The Barbie movie reminded me of Sims 3 graphics, tbh.
the shade to James 😂😂😂😂
Gotta say that Bratz soundtracks have better songs than many number one hits
Also, never use a picture of Sigourney Weaver unless it's from the movie Alien bc who the hell doesn't love that movie!?
Oh my god the Barbie as rapunzel graphics are worse than I remember 😂😂
ok but this is myscene erasure kurtis
So… at 14:32, I unfortunately had some water in my mouth. I spat it all over my blanket and floor. Jesus, every time I watch one of these videos, I laugh so hard I break something.
Kurtis, or shall I say, Lubalin, you’re a damn gem.
Or a Barbie Bar
God I loved the fashion pixies movie so much, especially that tree summoning scene for some reason...
okay virgin
Kurtis you need to watch Barbie and the 12 Dancing Princesses!!
Barbie was my fav as a kiddd 😭🥺
It’s not snow! It’s snow!
ya hooo da ba yo
BRATZ IS SUPERIOR SO THANK YOU BC THAT WAS MY FAVORITE MOVIE
Wom wom womm Yeayeayeaaaaah!
pls watch the the bratz kidz sleepover adventure that shit was WHACK and scarred me as a child
18:44 PLSS THE ARCTIC MONKEYS REFERENCE WAS THE ONE THING I REALLY NEEDED RIGHT NOW THANK YOU KURTIS
this is the funniest video ive ever seen kurtis
Anyone here familiar with LOL dolls? I worked at a toy store for 3 years right when LOL dolls first dropped and they were HUGE! Also created by the same middle aged man who created Bratz 😬
Team Bratz ———-—->
I can appreciate a good snow reference
“mattel me that” lol
✨Raaaapunzelll iss baaald noww✨
next: myscene vs polly pocket
Ok i am a Barbie kid I did have a few bratz dolls but I was mostly a Barbie kid and I watched all the movies but I SPECIFICALLY remember the bratz movie scene where they get the pixie glasses and I thought they were sick af.  Also kurtis why didn’t you choose one of the Barbie musicals or even the 12 dancing princess (it wasn’t a musical but that movie is a banger)  Kurtis you did Barbie movies so dirty we all deserve an apology I’m waiting 😩🤚🏼
"M Ä T T Ē L   MÈ   THĀT" -Kurtis Conner, 2021
Wait until you hear about Baby Alive *
You didn't choose Bratz: Rock Angelz!? How could you.
"Why would she lie to her about that?"  "Why would she lie to me about that?" "Thats what I'm sayin!!!"
Bro, a “flying unicorn” is called an ALICORN. Watch my little pony and learn about it.
Hi Kurtis.  I like your chicken

Pleaseee do a part 2 with princess & the pauper and rock angels!! Iconic
Anyone else notice the psilocybin mushrooms in “pixie land” lol
Love use of Greendale's flag 2:50 Streets ahead, man.
I'm glad you didnt do the extra greeting. I still love you man. Dont become a one line wonder. You got this buddy.
Ya hoooo da ba yooooo
TRAITOR!
barbie, next point
THAT “so no headwig” PART HAD ME SCREAMINGGGG
Kurtis I can't believe you chose to watch barbie as rapunzel and not barbie and the diamond castle smh it's so much better they are lesbians
Kurtis you need to watch Barbie musicals
So idk about the barbie movie but in the tangled movie Rapunzel pulled her hair up and made sure that the weight from someone climbing her hair wasn't pulling on her roots. The only part that would hurt is the roots, so if you just leave some room for your hair to breathe at your head then no, it wouldn't hurt. The pressure would just be on your hair and not your roots.
You should watch Bratz: The movie
:(
“Do thy carpets match thy drapes?”🤣🤣🤣🤣😭
I used to play with xmen action figures but have them go on dates and get married like how ppl often play with barbies. Yes, I grew up to be Gay, why do you ask?
Umm, Penelope was AFRAID of HEIGHTS Kurtis, but she overcame her fears to help Barbie fly over the magical barrier. There was a whole C plot about this and her relationship with her father, smh
hey Kurtis why do you look you were turned down for a background character in a 70s porno mockbuster?
Mattel me that has been added to my vocabulary
literally all the bratz movies are a fever dream. that one sleepover one absolutely traumatized me as a child that was (and still is) genuinely terrifying
6:28 “rapunzel and friends” lmfao 24:47 “Brianna and friends”
Guys, Idk, somehow I'm getting the vibe that this creator isn't a virgin
DOTH THY CARPETS MATCH THY DRAPES
Kurtis looks more and more like a country man every video
Why did they make the gnome Irish 😭😭😭
I completely forgot there was no music in the chase scene...... My parents were really tired of my shit to buy these movies for me to watch.
Kurtis is out here ruining my childhood with carefree abandon
This is one of the best videos I’ve ever seen actually
the real ones were the kids who had monster high and ever after high dolls
When we were in seventh grade me and my back then best friend would ironically and religiously watch the Rapunzel barbie movie so much that our most used catchphrase sort of thing was just me randomly yelling "oOOOooOOtto" on Gretel's voice and her answering "MISTRESS" on the weasel voice. We would do this all day long at completely random moments sometimes during class.
Wow, no second greeting by this virgin over here, why am I even subscribed?
now do an entire video titled  "why monster high is better than barbie or bratz"
I’m glad I had both bratz and Barbies, but bratz have way better outfits
Forehead 😡😡 👀 👄 💪🏼🦋
Ya hooo da ba yo
Jacket 🧥 pop up in the snow ❄️ was a great day to see how you are feeling and what you doing are have a good day night   Jack pop
This entire video activated a third grade version of me that literally wanted to hit Kurtis like he’s my baby brother every time he made a gross joke 😂
Whats the point of Barbie or Bratz without VERSACE ??  https://shrinke.me/6Gn2
But
barbie as rapunzel unlocked a part of my memory i didn't know i had. thanks kurtis!
No way a self righteous know it all 20 something Hates kids who would have guessed
the barbie cinematic universe is my entire childhood and I enjoy the movies to this day LMAO
Did you research this at all do you really think there weren't any black Barbies before the 2000s...barbie is only one of the many dolls in the barbie line. There are all different kinds of barbie dolls Christie came out in 1968 and was a dark skinned black Barbie.
ok but remember cutting your own barbies hair
“Kelly looks like what stubbing your toe feels like” 😂😂😂
ya hooo da ba yo
kurtis you're mad funny 😭 i b trying hard not to make a ball jokes too 😭
I haven't laughed this hard in weeks
SHAVE PLEASE NASHTY
I adore barbie movies but you picked one of the worst barbie movies of all time, next time do the fairytopia series
God, the Bratz: Pixies movie is the most 2000s thing I have ever seen...but honestly, even though it's weird AF, it's still such a wonderful movie  And honestly, I totally wish Kurtis would review one of the Barbie musicals, too! The Barbie musicals are genuinely amazing! Some of my favorite Barbie movies are Barbie as The Princess and the Pauper and Barbie and the Twelve Dancing Princesses!
SigHorny Weezer?
barbies idea of diversity is adding a redhead and brunette and a blonde 😍
Why did u pick the worst of both movies watch like the mermaid one and the brats babies was lit
He did Barbie dirty! He should have picked Barbie and the 12 Dancing Princesses
ya hooo da ba yo
I loved this midsummer double feature video so much, thank you Kurtis, this is what I needed
This is content. When I can see someone’s personality is when I subscribe :)
ngl now kurtis reminds me of weird al yankovic in the 80's
Barbie is better because my younger cousin plays with bratz dolls and she is annoying. This is the only reason I need.
why does the weasel sound like dub Hisoka-
Barbie movies were my childhood. They will always stay iconic.
QUALITY video this week sheeeesh
"...surprisingly chipper... WOOD CHIPPER"
Barbie The Princess and the Pauper was iconic and one of the best kids movies lol I wish Kurtis had done that one.  I forgot how terrifying the animation was on the earlier ones 😂
Hedwig is female.
2 words… monster high
kurtis, i beg you to do this with barbie fairy topia vs bratz rock angels. THOSE ARE THE BEST ONES OF THEM BOTH. you would love bibble
Kurtis, please make a cooking channel called "Very Really Food".
Please sign my petition for kurtis to watch Barbie Island Princess
SO here for this. team bratz
Please shave Kurtis
I know the Barbie movie was made in 2002 but damn that animation looks soooo bad.  I know there are a bunch of Barbie movies and I’ve seen a few and some were pretty good but I have never heard of this one and I can see why lol I
Barbie's the good girl and Bratz is the bad girl that's it
actually kurtis barbie rapunzel was my favorite movie growing up and i got to name my brother after prince stefan so
18:59 LMAO too good.
Bratz movies were, and forever will be, iconic
Super rude to rate my favourite childhood animated movie a 4/10 (that's the only animated movie I was watching, my favourite childhood movies are Twister, Dante's Peak and The Color Purple....). I'm hurt.
I like the Bratz dolls way more than Barbies but the Barbie movies go so hard the fairy ones and when they’re in the ocean the ones with the Bibble those movies are so good
I feel like Bratz dolls were the edgier, younger, trendier versions of Barbie. And I think I remember my mom not wanting me to be into Bratz dolls because the name "Bratz" was like, too sassy? Like you shouldn't want to be a brat?
Ya hooo da ba yo
HOW DARE HE NOT HAVE AN EXTRA GREETING
Unsubscribed.  I refuse to be a member or Kurtistown if I don't get my extra greeting.  (jik, I love you.  Still hurts tho.)
the gnome's irishness was a little too realistic for my liking
I love that he made a whole skit about her hair being pulled out when the hair is clearly wrapped around a beam to offset the weight
bratz is better i agree
could you… could you call scrotum scrolls… scrolltums?
algorithm ya
Did persona 5 steal the plot bratz fashion pixies
Bratz movies actually aren't /that/ bad from what I remember, defiantly more inclusive.
To be fair, that Irish gnomes accent is actually pretty good, in comparison to other Irish accents in media
What’s the point of being subscribed if I don’t even get an extra greeting guess I have to unsubscribe now
Chalk zone is awesome!
wheres the extra greeting
ohhh this is where the "leave it to me ugh" meme came from
the james charles disss
I will not stand for the lack of MyScene representation lol I was obsessed with my Madison doll
todos viendo las letras “vrg”: virgin yo, una mexicana: verga xd
Im crying laughing at the fucking weasle
please we need a part 2 for this reveiw another two moviesss ommmmgg
You picked the worst Barbie movie
you shouldve watched barbie the princess and the pauper its literally the besttttt
Plss I need him to do a part 2
Kurtis has so much energy.
should have watched bratz genie magic!!!!!!!
Ya hooo da ba yo
I must be really tired, because I laughed at everything Curtis said 😂. (Not that he’s not funny when I’m not tired)
Your hair is TOPFASH. Smashing.
Ya hooo da ba yo
My mom didn't let me have Bratz because "they looked like prostitutes". Big oof, Mom.
bruh, Barbie as Rapunzel was one of my fave movies as a child lol
I now need to see something about Monster High or Ever After High
surprised quentin tarantino didn’t win horniest weasel award
"So no Hedwig.?" Made me laugh so hard. Also "Do I wanna gnome" followed by the face palm. xD
This video had no business being that funny lmao also f Kelly
CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW CREEPY THE BRATZ DOLLS ARE AS KIDS
8:55 You r just dirty minded 😂
Ewww this review is so toxic .. man 5:20 she’s not real  I didn’t even have those thoughts like the kids was ugly .. jeesh u r so judgmental
I used to watch this movie ALL THE TIME AHAH
Please please please watch Barbie: Mermadia. Bibble is great and its way better than Rapunzel
my sister used to love this movie because she too had a nightmarishly large forehead as a young child. also named kelly. barbie with the accidental slam dunk in represention
AHH U SHOULDVE WATCHED BRATZ ROCK ANGELZ IT IS AMAZING I SWEAR
the bratz babies movies>>>>>>
ok good kurtis still makes videos 😅
I laughed, thanks Kurt.
As someone who has seen most of the bratz and barbies movies, it's such a shame that it its so hard to convince a friend to watch them. Like they are all a fucking trip and deserved to be laughed at.
I literally subscribed for an extra greeting. Goodbye forever <3
when you finally sub so the extra greeting can feel like its just for you and then he decides not to do it. :'(
when you only subscribe for the extra greeting😭
I CRIED SO HARD WATCHING THIS... HE IS HILARIOUS
i had the original Bratz pixie dolls with their wands n i loved them
dylan looks like lilhuddy
When it came to the weasel I thought you were exaggerating until 10:59 happened
"Worried about how Barbie farts..."   Yeah, TOTTALLY NOT a virgin...
10:18 reminds me of the scene in shrek 3 where rapunzel goes bald lol
I fuckin loved Chalk Zone
I have somehow managed to see both of those movies as a kid and I had neither of those dolls.
Okay but Bratz had an accurate Irish accented gnome and we can't take that away from them
I gotta say... I watched all barbie movies since I was a kid... never one of Bratz... so yea. I loved most of them and was always emotional for the story lol
You would think with all the money Bratz and Barbie makes they’d have at least SOME half decent animation quality. I’m not looking for MCU level budgeting but at least make it watchable
"This was your one chance for Kelly to not look like what stubbing your toe feels like" I'm laughing so hard
kurty please react to gnomeo and juliet please please please it's my favrite movie pleaseeeeeee
Everyone do me a favor and search Doug Henning and tell me that isnt just older Kurtis. I need you all to see the resemblance
I don't get it. What's wrong with a musicless chase scene in a movie? O_o
bratz were the cool kids barbie so i think this video was settled before it began. barbie couldn't complete, monster high could though.
ya hooo da ba yo
at least he didn't miss the opportunity to include "so no head?" this time
I feel like you rly tried to come for this movie, but it’s just too good😩
This movie is a comfort movie
just realised i accidentally watched thi s entire video muted! thank god <3
I need him to watch mermaidia now I want him to see bibble
they couldn't put orchestra music behind the chasing scene because they used up all their budget on kelly's forehead
stephan running gives major npc vibes
Me and my brother watch the Barbie movie yearly and it never stops being hilarious
BARBZ MENTION YOU KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE AKDJDHVD
"do i wanna gnome", i'll never sing this song properly again
28:46 bless you!
this gnome sounds like he's  from the black lodge
What the fuck did I just watch
wait til you learn about bibble alias the best barbie movie character
pleeeeease watch bratz rock angelz
the myscene movie slaps, you should totally review it
Please do a reaction on the “Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princesses” 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
I lost it at 1:26 😂 I love your videos
i expect at least 3 extra greetings next time or i'll shoot
i love that you watched my favorite barbie movie AND my favorite bratz movie,,, seriously those were the best
please continue this as a series
the disappointment on kurtis’ face after saying “do i wanna gnome” is greater then any disappointment i’ve ever seen
u are not cool for not saying the extra greeting
The letter on the shelf stands for Verga, it means values in Spanish, so lovely.
The James Charles roast was immaculate :0
18:47 ..the exact moment where kurtis rethinks his life and regrets it all
idc what anyone says bratz music is superior
Scrolltums
ya hooo da ba yo
✨scrolltum✨
kurtis you obviously didn’t pay attention to barbie as rapunzel bc Penelope the dragon CANT FLY HIGH UP YET bc her dad dragon won’t teach her :((((
I lost it at dylan twerking
great video, i want the extra greeting back and btw: Brooklyn 99, season 2, episode 18, 0:46 is what i want to do with kurtis
Extra greeting???
kelly is cute you are wrong
when i heard that gnome speaking irish i nearly fell off my chair omfg
I loved both of these when I was younger. I did have a lot more bratz stuff than barbie including magazines and even a DS game. I do think barbie is more realistic than bratz but like you said barbie wasn’t that inclusive about skin colour before barbie. I love them equally
I remember my mom didn't want me to watch/play with Bratz doll because she thought it would make me act like them. *WELL JOKES ON YOU MOM I TURNED OUT LIKE THEM ANYWAY*
I HATE YOU! GONNA WATCH PRINCESS AND THE PAUPER SCREW YOU
bratz has NOTHING on barbie AND I WILL DIE ON THIS HILL 🙄✋
the absolute Fear i felt when i heard that gnome speak irish cannot be overstated cailíní just means girls btw
Oh my god I have been trying to remember the name of Chalk Zone for months now. Bless you
kurtis is not a barb confirmed 😦
No it wouldn't hurt if you knotted your hair around the column like rapunzel did in the scene, to create a strong grip.
why is her waist small enough for the man to wrap 2 hands around it,,,, talk about totally normal proportions
Everytime Kurtis uploads I KNOW Im gonna have a good time and laugh SO fucking hard. You are a light in the darkness lol ily
Fuck I remember the Barbie movie way too well
11:20 the song actually kinda bops when it’s x1.5 speed!
ur mustache looks creepy kurtis. pls shave for the safety of the citizens of kurtis town
Kurtis please review princess charm school or just more barbie movies in general. Your take on movies from my childhood is both scarring and hilarious.
POOORRR KELLYYY !!!!! Barbie recycles the same three young girls in every barbie movie and we just say it’s okay👍 🤣. The sarcastic humour throughout this whole video had me wheezing with laughter, but please say I’m not the only one who still genuinely enjoys both barbie and BRATZ movies. Kurtis should watch barbie 12 dancing princesses for the monkey and BRATZ Jennie magic because the guards are scary🤣
I remembered the barbie paint brush scene from my childhood and that's it from this movie. I always wondered what the movie was called. Thanks Kurtis!
11:30
3:17 cause barbie is 1 character and Bratz is clearly plural so no shit there different skin tones
"and now we are at the climax, don't worry not the weasel" fricking brilliant
Obviously Barbie
Chalk zone was one my favorite shows
you shouldve seen rock angelz its the best bratz movie of all
So you chose Bratz pixies over Bratz rock angels?? Okay….
Why does the weasel have human teeth?
1.7mil views what
i couldve sworn the rendering in these movies was better
Bratz was actually sued by mattel cause their employee who suggested for a "Bratz like" toy which mattel rejected went to MGA and MGA gave it a shot. It was said that the idea was only created because of that one person who worked for mattel before and it was said that obviously it was a created because that employee was exposed to how Barbie was created. I don't know the true story but that's what I read about.
The level of editing in this video is insane considering all the other stuff he does as well PS: ya hooo da ba yo
3:57 Oh my God, yes! You are so right! I literally think that as well!
So glad I found this channel 🤍
Bro i wanted that brush from barbie rapunzel soooo much...
cantbelieve u misgendered hegwig. cancelled
*the bratz movie was infinitely better*
something about this video really just hit different
Bald Kurtis isn’t real  He can’t hurt you Bald Kurtis isn’t real He can’t hurt you
hey man, i really wish you didn't skip the extra greeting
Very really good
are we not gonna adress the irish gnome cos that was the funniest  fucing thing
Current isn't available in the US. I turned off my VPN so now my ip address is in Canada (like Kurtis), but Current isn't available in Canada either. So since I'm too lazy to change location to another, I'm going a assume that Current did a Notch and region blocked the app for every country.
Hilarious! So happy I stumbled across your channel!
Omfgs! That gnome had THE MOST PERFECT regional Irish accent. Sounds like he's from County Cork. He even used the Irish word for girls, "Cailíní". That's amazing. Bratz wins immediately. Hands down.
4:05 the Bratz were also much more fashionable than Barbie. I love their clothes much better
Where is my extra greeting, goodbye. I don't want to watch you anymore.
classic curtis with a cay acting up bc of children 🙄
Kelly looks like what stubbing your toe feels like.   Jesus I can't breathe!
Just wanna say that there was a huge missed opportunity to say "Scrolltum" in this video
I think that Kurtis is going insane or something. That garden gnome was really small, yet he went on a rant about it being "giant". I'm so confused.    Edit: I've gone insane.
23:39 best part
dude if you watched all the barbie movies and made videos about it i would probably binge watch them
hey kurtis your next video is gonna be your 200th one... better have something special in store >:)
Eh. You picked a terrible barbie movie. Barbie and the Princess and the Pauper was good.
I CAN NOT believe you have not mentioned barbie rapunzel ball gown picking scene 😡😡😡😡
Would you do a reaction video on the Salvatore Brothers from Vampire Diaries you kinda look like Stefan
Don't get me wrong, Barbie in Rapunzel is great for content...but the Barbie movie that epitomizes all Barbie movies is Princess and the Pauper!!!!! You chose the perfect bratz movie tho.
Barbie Mermaidia was the best series.
I find your extra greetings annoying AF but dammit, a video without one just isn't right 🤧 gimme my extra greeting Connor! I subscribed!!
The Barbie movie was one of my top three movies as a kid and in hindsight I think that weasel explains why I am the way that I am
dO tHy CaRPets mAtch tHY dRapEs?
C'mon Kurtis, for such a fine cinema experience one always grabs a beer. ya hooo da ba yo
forget elder scrolls 6 give me scrotum scrolls
Tbh my favorite Barbie movie was the one where she has 11 sisters and she dances and all. I didn’t even know there was a Bratz movie 😅
John 3:16 "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life."  Have a blessed day, brothers and sisters in Christ!
I can’t get his mustache looking like the weasel out of my head omg-
Not gonna watch the video but I do want to say that I'm still mad at my parents for thinking it was a good idea to only let me have a tennis barbie bc it was about me having a role model. I was attracted to bratz bc of the sick fashion and diversity and coolness. Anyway my parents only protected me from fun and none of the things in the media did end up scarring my childhood, homophobia racism sexism etc so !the hypocrisy!. And yes im an adult now and yes I am still mad. I'm allowed to be. If my parents really cared so much about what kind of role models I'm exposed to they should have bought me a drunk barbie. Anyway I don't even like to dress like brats or barbies or even in any feminine way at all but I still liked they way they look. Those damn toys aren't role models. They're just toys. It doesn't hurt kids to let them play with toys. Omg more hypocrisy. So my parents won't let me have bratz or barbies except for tennis barbie but my younger my brother can play with toy guns and war robots? Oh yeah that makes sense. Makes a lot of sense.  Also I'm not watching the video bc neither of them are better they're both great. Toys are great when children can play with them. And in case you were wondering, my brother didn't turn into a war robot and I don't play tennis.
kurtis looks like a yee yee boi  I can not explain it but he does   (thats a compliment btw)
I wish you would have went deeper in the Mattel and MGA sue story bc it’s rly interesting lol
Bratz are so cute. And girls have been purposely jacking their styles so lol
ya hooo da ba yo
“Flying unicorn” Bruh that’s a fcking alicorn 😡
My name is Kellie and I legit have a huge forehead😭🤣
bless you!
monster high is where it's at.
For maximum funnys watch at 2am
Hey. I subscribed for the extra greeting, Kurtis.
Loving the chaotic intro
Wow this movie even has LSD infused sunglasses
I had both bratz and barbie and love both for different reason. I had, and played to completion the bratz playstation game and Chloe was my fav brat, idk why man. But i also had loads of barbies and her horse and camper van and watch all the barbie movies. The ealy, like 90s, barbie movies are kinda quikry n i love it but the early 2000s is where barbie hit their peak (like yeah the animation has improved but still). the newest barbie movies just lack that same magic story and art style that they did back then. Like dont even get me started on princess and the popstar, totally ripped of a destoryed princess and the pauper which was the first barbie musical and just so icon so f princess and the popstart haha
Bro you easily have the worst moustaches on YouTube please for the love of god stop growing it out
21:54, that's not kurtis, that's flashdance
8:51 *Stolas flashbacks*
"brianas friends" didnt watch bratz rock angels smh
lowkey bratz fasion style slapped
8:56 Hedwig is a girl bruh
kurtis' puns are the only reason im alive rn
Ive always hated Kelly
i'mma need you to do another bratz vs barbie video chief
barbie wins i do not care, the bratz games were amazing though
I felt personally attacked by the lack of an extra greeting Kurtis. 😩💔😞
Idk guys I played with both barbie amd bratz, I eatched the Bratz series and Barbie movies ANDDD played their games. Why not enjoy both of em?
Why so many dislikes 😢
“Why stay on topic when you could simply ~not~?”
rapunzel holds her hair or ties it onto something else so its pulling on the object and not on the head. kind of like holding your hair and brushing it so it doesnt pull
no one: kurtis:  s c r o t u m    s c r o l l s
barbie life in the dreamhouse
Pls make a part 2 and + watching Barbie Fairytopia😩
Ya hooo da ba yo                                           BITCH
Monster High?
doth thy carpets match thy drapes 😂😭
everytime i look at the v sitting on the shelf it makes me feel uneasy
These movies were my religion as a kid
Quentin Tarantino was ROBBED of the Horniest Weasel Award YET AGAIN! 😤😤😤
“bratz babyz: the movie” is ingrained in my brain forever
where is my extra greeting???
i loved barbie swan lake so much
If you don't give me my fucking extra greeting I stg
Justice for MyScene dolls! Where’s their representation???!!
man he watched a Bratz movie and didn't watch the one about the carnival that one used to give me nightmares
I never really liked brats when I was little, nor did my mom. I liked their clothes and the tv show but I thought the dolls themselves were kind of ugly. The huge eyes and lips were too much and I hated the feet. I loved barbie dolls a lot and monster high as well. In my opinion monster high dolls were so much prettier then brats. Their faces didn’t look so weird. They had big eyes and lips but they weren’t obnoxiously large and they were appealing to the eye.
If you made me listen to this blindfolded and asked me who I thought it was, I would say drew gooden
"man, I can not get over this weasel. i saw this movie days ago i canNOT stop thinking about him"  duude,you're in love
13:34 the mustard bottle noise 💀
I will pay you $20 to do a livestream of the bratz rock angel play station 2 game or bratz diamonds whichever you prefer, those games were so steez
did anyone else have the dvd version of this where there was hair makeover bonus game, or did i make that up?
AAAAHHHH I loved this Barbie movie as a child THANK YOU FOR THIS
I think this discussion needs further analytical work to be done before we can justify the decision of a winning discourse. May i suggest watching bratz sleepover adventures, genie magic (also bratz), princess and the pauper(barbie) and barbie and the 12 dancing princesses. I would describe them as the best movies from each company made around the same time.
“Okay and this is just not realistic” lmfao
i watched bratz (evr after high monster high etc) movies all the time as a kid so seeing this was rlly nostalgic
Fully forgot about Chalk Zone Holy shit thank you 😅
Why do I subscribe if I don’t get an extra greeting
Def asking my man to send me some ball scrolls while he's at work tmrw.
Honestly, if I’m not getting my extra greeting I think I’m just gonna unsub cuz like there’s no point anymore
Excuse me sir those flying unicorns are PEGASUS
I feel like I remember watching the Bratz movie, but very vaguely. The mom scene looks very familiar.
Yeah, he porks his girl on the reg….
commenting 4 da algorithim
Kurtis should name one of his segments Kurtis’ Corner
kurtis PLEASE watch the bratz baby movie. THE PLOT IS CHAOTIC
ok but lets see you review polly pocket movies
The editing of this video reminds me of BrutalMoose in the best ways
We’ve been able to tell for a very really long time that you don’t want to do your extra greeting anymore, so just be straight up with us and tell us you don’t want to do it anymore. It will be a sad end to an era but we will get over it. Communication is key Kurtis.
Dylan is why i have high expectations
The no music chase scene is an homage to No Country for Old Men
Only virgins don't give the extra greeting, Kurtis
girl watch more barbie movies like swan lake, 12 dancing princesses, princess and the pauper, mermaidia or diamond castle there's so many and they're good as
Just recognized Bratz is brats written stylish xD Never thought about it xD
YES THATS MY FAVORITE BRATZ MOVIE
loved the arctic monkeys reference
Cancelling Kurtis again, I will not stand for this blasphemy against us,
5:34 damn and i thought hobi was a sunshine
Kurtis kowboys.
please react to bratz babies its like a fever dream
I thought I have never seen this Barbie Rapunzel movie but as I'm watching u watch these scenes it's all coming back to me like a fever dream
Monster high. You have, to watch it now!
Hedwig uses she/her pronouns
This is an amazing throwback for me
Hold on. I have factoid.   I used to have a black barbie. She looked really nice. I really like how I could cut out paper and put it in her little clear plastic dress. But yeah, there was a weird feeling with barbie's friends. I found one kinda tan brunette one, little barbie and skipper on my own. And I was a Barbie Stan as a kid.  Anyway, back to Barbie Vs. Bratz.
My parents were definitely part of the group of people who thought brats were "too sexy, too slutty." But now that I'm an adult I'm realizing I prob actually would've played with the dolls i had if I got Bratz instead of Barbie. My mom was sad I never got into Barbies because she was into Barbies growing up but I always preferred stuffed animals. ~just girly things~
WHY IS DYLAN DANCING SO MUCH
It’s the Arthur knock of for me🤣🤣🤣
I didn't play with either I had monster high girls
Realized there was no extra greeting & now am going to click off
this is my favorite kurtis video XD
should have watched Barbie mariposa or princess and the pauper!!!! they’re the best ones!
I’m crying why didn’t i get my greeting
Ima be honest I forgot the video was abt bratz until he reminded me
10:58 I’ve literally been thinking about this weasel’s moment and coming back to rewatch it for the past 4 days since this video was uploaded, I can’t get him out of my head
no my mom wouldn’t let me have bratz dolls
ohhh he said virgin… i’ve watched this video ten times the past 4 days wondering why vegans weren’t getting any action. virgin makes much more since. thank you for your service kortis.
Also, in the middle of the lawsuit, Bratz changed their slogan from "the girls with a passion for fashion" to "the *_only_* girls with a passion for fashion" which I find hysterical
(18:20) "y'know it's about time you nosy _cailínís_ got yer selves a million miles away from here!?"  - weird Irish gnome caricature   "Cailín" means girl in Irish. "Cailíní" is the plural of cailín (girls). "Cailínís" is a butchered Irish word with a mashup of Irish and English pluralisation. Damn gnome has to brush up on his Gaeilge
bratz bc barbie sucks
18:50 is me every time i say a joke in my head
this weeks episode: Kurt trys to convince us that he's not a virgin (p.s. Kurt's is definitely a virgin)
Only a man could skip over the ICONIC Barbie Repunzel magic dress makeover scene
Funniest dude ever bro I’ve never laughed so fucking much
please do the extra greeting it get me through the week🙌
"ya hooo da ba yo"
Monster High is better 💜💜
why would you pick this barbie movie, Barbie and the nutcracker would be a wiser choice
You didn't watch a good Barbie movie you need to watch princess and the pauper
I firmly believe that you watched one of the worst Barbie movies and they were not given a true chance. I demand more Barbie movies 😤
ya hooo da ba yo
It’s your first time watching these..sadly cannot relate
Imagine a child watches this video, just hoping for some barbie or bratz content, yikes.
thought it was for virgo for some reason <\3
my dad used to call my bratz dolls prostitots...
Rapunzel is bald now had me fuckin crying
My parents HATED Bratz dolls because 1) they were called brats so therefore they must be setting a bad example 2) they wore makeup and 3) they all wore crop tops On an unrelated note the barbie movies SLAPPED and Repunzel is one of the more mediocre ones in my opinion
they way balls echoed for so long 😭
I never realized how bad the quality in these movies was, technology really changed a lot
how DARE Kurtis say Hedwig was a he, hedwig is a GIRLBOSS
ok but if u watched princess and the pauper this wouldve gone very differently
i grew up on all the barbie movies but i’m disappointed the only bratz movie i ever saw was bratz super babyz (still an iconic movie tho)
VRG stands for verga
Lmaooo the vrg stands for very really good and not virgin?!?!? What?!?!?
Kurtis, you need to do a review on the "Bratz Forever Diamonds" movie, you won't regret it!
he is not a dad and already making dad jokes
i am not a jerk KURTIS.
Wow YOU HAVE CHANGED SM i loved your vine videos xD i remember the shoe shoeeeee🥲❤️
Having flashbacks throughout the second half of the video of the childhood sleepover I watched that bratz movie at, I’m pretty sure it’s the only one I ever saw too 😂
I believed in you kurtis....pls this is princess and the pauper slander
Kurtis you are a legend :D
with that mullet-like hair and the moustaches he looks like a perv from georgia lol
12 dancing princesses PLEASE
Idc but bratz musics SLAAAPPSSS especially bratz diamonds album or any of their songs😩
Will be needing Monster High movie and webisodes reviews 😩
both these movies used to terrify me
we should make him rate all the barbie movies so that he has to watch all the barbie movie
DO I WANNA GNOME AIAH19S71832748SYWVSV
I’ll always loved Bratz more because I felt like I could relate to them more. The diversity and their humor was just everything. Barbie was cute too I ain’t gonna lie. #BringBackBratz
kurtis conner calling a bratz movie a 'film' is feminism. take that quentin
nnoo u shouldve watched barbie diamond castle
Seriously that weasle is so fucking  creepyyyyyy  How was this even approved ???
I remember Bratz Dollz being for "bad kids". Lol.  But that weasel was the most iconic villain ever.
i think that barbie and bratz are good.
Kurtis continuing his metamorphosis into a 1980's hockey player
hell yeah this is the content we needed
Hedwig is a girl
Okay but what about the bratz live action movie
bless you :)
I loved Barbie, but I was a definite Bratz girl growing up. I even had the carrying case for the little Bratz dolls. Surprise surprise it was shaped like a pair of giant lips
You should watch Bratz Genie Magic, it actually bangs tbf
if you hate kelly you should watch barbie and the 12 dancing princesses you'll love it
Barbie saying "balls" with the echo sends me every time. Do more commentary on these movies please I beg of you
kurtis should review all the barbie movies and bratz movies this video is so entertaining
*scrotum scrolls*
no no no we need a part 2. kelly sabatoged the whole thing. do princess and the pauper this time.
Kurtis how you gonna pick the worst Barbie movie and the best bratz one. Smh you should’ve done the Barbie fairy movie
18:52 doing these videos is starting to take a toll on Kurtis' psyche. He's fuckin losing it
You're cool, Kurtis!
Personally I’m very disappointed in James Connor, I was promised an extra greeting which I did not get. After I typed this out I realized I spelled his name wrong, but he doesn’t deserve his name being spelled correctly if he doesn’t give me an extra greeting. Very very disappointed.
I'm gonna say it lena is all I've ever wanted to look like
Great video, but could you please put a flashing lights warning before the bratz dance party scene?
This video is everything thank you sir
Ya hooo da ba yo😜
I want kurtis to review the song fish heads
ya hooo da ba yo
I'm sorry, FLYING UNICORNS?? DO YOU MEAN PEGASUS??????
I feel like Kurtis is brcoming extra savage
Okay now we gotta watch the bratz super babies movie cause i wanna hear kurtis’s opinion in the potatoes
damn you picked the wrong barbie movie
I don't know who the hell thinks John Holms is a virgin. Yes, I made that joke on one of your other videos.
He should be rating them from playing the video games. Bratz Rock Angelz went HARD.
Nice virgin sign
:( no extra greeting… awe…
kurtis this video BANGS dude
The "balls" clip echoes for so long I'm gonna be hearing it in my dreams
the gnome was probably supposed to sound irish but it sounds jamaican LOL
I wanted to be an evil pixie at that rave SO BAD when I was a kid
you shoulda watched barbie swan lake my dude
I wonder what runs through Jen’s head when she walks in on him doing his skits💀💀
Okay but all the Barbie ballet movies are the best. And it was my only way to kind of see a ballet as a kid, I didn't have access to the internet yet and actual shows are too expensive
I like not having the extra greeting Kurt
Ya hooo da ba yo
ok but barbie in a mermaid tale slaps
Can you watch one of the My Scene movies to rank against Barbie and Bratz??? Those movies were my shit. They even had Lindsay Lohan in the Hollywood one lol
the chaotic energy that this video exudes is amazing
In conclusion kurtis is  “babyphobic” and maybe “shortphobic”
I was obsessed with Barbie as Rapunzel as a kid. My sister and I both had the dolls and the hairbrush and her hair got longer ~ I also loved Penelope. Bratz kinda freaked me out and after these movie snippets I am even MORE terrified.   Kurtis twerking angrily made me laugh so hard I couldn't breathe also
Ok I'm actually really glad he didn't go an extra greeting, he's just seemed rather unenthusiastic lately about it.
Feel like this is just a decent into madness
The do I wanna gnome? And then the James Charles reference?! 🤌😂
BRUH I WAS LITERALLY CRYING SCREAM LAUGHING MAN OMG YOURE HILARIOUS THANK YOU AHWHIQJQOWJ
WHY DOES THAT GNOME HAVE THE BEST IRISH ACCENT IN FILM
In pride month too?? No extra greeting wth
"could a virgin have a podcast?" uh DUH dude Joe Rogan's podcast is like crazy popular.
This one was actually very funny, Kurtis. Nice job
Myscene erasure
I just want to acknowledge how Kurtis realizes that song was so similar to Arthur??? 😂😂😂
“Scroll-tums”
He sounds like he said “yahoo I’m gnome” and while that might not be what he said- I’d like to just imagine that’s what he said.
Princess and the Proper VS Bratz Rock Angels
nice moustache
DYLAN TWERKING
Get Trixie Mattel up in here
Please watch the barbie Princess and the Pauper, that weasel was nothing
I must have watched that Barbie Rapunzel movie 500 times as a kid. My nostalgia is off the charts right now
When I was younger I was like..wow the animation is so good…But now….. *nightmare fuel* just *NIGHTMARE FUEL*
Yes! Favourite videos are when you review movies <3 best most funniest stuff
the absolute only recollection i have of bratz is that one slumber party ‘scary’ movie
No no no... if you want to test the pinnacle of Barbie movies, don't pick Rapunzel... pick Princess and the Pauper
10/10???? for a BRATZ movie??? and only 4/10 for barbie????? you've lost all your credibility smh, your channel is really going downhill
ya hoo da ba yo
TWELVE DANCING PRINCESSES NEXT KURTIS PLEASE
No extra greeting?? I'm gonna unsubscribe 🤬🤬
i accidently said bless you out loud at the end...
i had never seen a kurits video before now and wow i was missing out i laughed out loud so many times
Barbie was obviously better
“Rapunzel is bald now” needs to happen wheres danny
normally the stuff kurtis makes videos about is stuff I know nothing about like the y2k one and the speedrun one, even the bad movie ones, but its so cool to see him make a video on something I grew up with 😳 like I know the dialogue in those movies off by heart lmfao
I found both these movies scary as a child, I still do. They creepy af.
You should watch the desert jewels bratz movie, it slapped 😩
You should have watched princess and the pauper what on earth what you thinking Kurtis
youtube algorithm recommend you since yesterday and I'm here so.... balls👁️👄👁️
WHERES THE EXTRA GREETING?!?!?!
Why does the weasel sound like Hisoka moaning?!
This made me laugh so many times. I went well beyond nose exhales on this one. Well beyond.
ive definitely watched bratz fashion pixies but i can't remember when.... or where.........
I thoroughly enjoyed this man watched the whole thing through. Especially since the brats movies were one of my favorites and I never realized how actually hilarious they are now after watching you ready to it it’s so bad
the "do i wanna gnome" joke made me laugh so hard i cried thank you kurt
heartbroken.
cut the mustache.
you fool i could just not subscribe and come back to watch more videos and therefore be still eligible for an extra greeting
I will continue too watch all your videos as they're released, but I see no reason to stay subscribed without my extra greeting.
19:16 got that one pixie looking like the Snapchat filter of just the eyes and the mouth enlarged taking up the whole face
You went pissing the fire out, I went gnomes like being peed on by dogs... either way, "ewwwwwwwww"
i am not following the bratz plot.
Sorry Kurtis hen no bratz fashion pixies slander in this town or we’ll have to impeach you
If this concept doesn't become a series then I will SUE.
Barbie and the nutcracker and Bratz Rock Angelz were my favorite growing up.
I was pretty mad that you simply denied the existence of Polly Pocket but they are also from Mattel so a Barbie x Bratz analysis makes more sense
Bratz are wwwaaaaaayyyy better!!
HA         balls.
God bless you! Your videos are my survival ❣️
"could a virgin have a podcast?" i had to pause to laugh my ass off because I, in fact, am a virgin who has a podcast
Do Monster High vs Everafter High next!!!
Oh no extra greeting? I'll be re subscribing when I get what I'm due.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
18:43 this is going in my kurtis hilights because wtf it was soo unexpected 😂 and the pause too. His mind.  Also 21:57 pls 😭
why does Stephan look like James Van Der Beek?
It’s only been 39 seconds & I already subscribed
I call BS: We all know Barbie would have won if he watched the film with Bibble.
28:48 bless you
I don't think you realize how traumatizing your home about the weasel leaving a white spot on the evil lady's coat was. I watched this video 4 days ago and it still haunts me
Bruh you didn’t pick princess and the pauper smh 😤😤😤😤
2:53 E PLURIBUS ANUS
You've singlehandedly dislodged a million memories in my mind... I've had flashbacks of the Bratz pixie club in my dreams but I thought they were just dreams... apparently not...
personally I felt the arctic monkeys reference will deserve a full apology video
Omggg plsss you could’ve watched better quality ones 😂 the animation makes me soooo uncomfortable 🤢
Why not both?
I love Bratz, I'm 27 and still.lo e them, I even bought the rock angels video game for the GameCube a few months ago! Barbie is great in its own right but I think Bratz just had more personality and fun fashion
Kurtis forgetting Monster High and Ever After High smh
boys: make fun of girls toys barbie bratz etc  girls toys: sell out more and a longer lasting image and have the biggest gross department when it comes to toy sales
PLEASE WATCH BARBIE LIFE IN THE DREAM HOUSE
I laughed so much!!! 🤣🤣
kurtis i need you to answer this question! do you like watching scott the woz? i saw it appear on your apology bit :)
Monster high is superior ‼️‼️
please watch the fairytopia barbie movies
you should have watched barbie and 12 dancing princesses, this is the crown jewel of barbie movies
That moment where Kurtis adressed to Hedwig as a "He" ; _ ;  (8:59)
The bratz movie about them doing the fashion competition was what I breathed as a kid
kurtis I'd pay for you to watch barbie as the princess and the pauper
they are both good but bratz movies and shows are definitely better
Bratz dolls actually came first before barbie did
I'm so sad about Kurtis not knowing spanish and missing the "brutal" meme starrying Dylan
Kinda disappointed kurtis didn’t use that bratz fairytale movie as a comparison 🙄
bro I've just jailed you so many times😭😭
If you compare this current Style to your profile picture it has reached perfection! The mustache with the mullet is just glorious
You should do video about Piper Rockelle
Another thing that is in both movies: BIG BÄÄLLS
I wasn't aloud to watch Bratz at such a young age like I was Barbie cause they were a bad influence with behavior and sometimes the way they dressed
But I subscribed for an extra greeting🥺🤦🏽‍♀️ unsubscribing now🥰✨
I WANT MY EXTRA GREEING CURTIS
i loved the bratz dolls but barbie movies have a place in my heart
The weasel was the “give him to me auh” dude
THE LIKES LMAO
Bless you btw
bratz is superior you’re right kurtis
REVIEW A MONSTER HIGH MOVIE PLEASE, I WOULD CRY
I love the bratz pixie movie it defined my childhood
Barbie
Not y'all forgetting he literally didn't give us our extra greeting.... He didn't care anymore, it's getting out of hand.
Gothel incel moment
Wwhy did I think you were justin bieber from the thumbnail
sighorny weaser
I feel like even if everyone comments that we don’t want him to make these review videos anymore, he’s still gonna do it. He can’t be stoped.
Bratz won for serving the epic dances
I love u Kurt
I feel like he did barbie so dirty by not choosing one of the musicals, the music is always the best part of the films!!
There goes my childhood. Can’t look at Barbie the way I used to 😖😖
Thanks for not giving us an extra greeting :3 That's very based of you
"hey why stay on topic when you can simply not"  -kurtis conner 2021
I need barbie and the pauper babe
Why did Kurtis watch the only barbie movie that is not a musical?
A weasel has never made me more uncomfortable till this very moment
Idk why this video happened, but I'm so happy it did😂
This video is really good. Good job, Kurtis!
DISLIKE! barbies will always be superior
tw: kelly
My mom wouldn’t let me have Bratz dolls because she thought just the name Bratz encourage girls acting like a brat/having an attitude lol
i tried to watch/listen to this video whilst doing my make up; needless to say, i was not successful. it got to the weasel part and i started laughing so hard i had to stop trying to put on eyeliner. then there was another moment- i think with the angry twerking- where i started laughing so hard that i accidentally messed up my eyeliner
wood chipper i hardly know her
Everyone knows that barbie and the pauper is the best barbie film......
Kinda surprised the gnome had an actual Irish accent and said "Cailíní" which is legit Irish for "girls".
18:44 kurtis, this is the last straw. i cant handle it anymore😔
nice video
The fact i grew up on barbie movies and i thought they made perfect sense,,, now im just fucking confused
i need you to watch bratz super babies. please.
Not Kurtis calling Chloe, Jade, Sasha and Yasmin Brianna's friends 😭😭😭
the first video posted after subscribing.... and i don't even get an extra greeting :') i would like to speak to a deputy of kurtistown
AYO barbie horse adventures for the ps2 was and is the only video game that will ever matter.
i'd like to brag to everyone that i have barbie books because i'm a bad bitc
Preminger from barbie and the pauper is a gay icon!
The barbie pc games were THE SHIT!!!
"Nevermind they're just all freaks" I cant- 😭😂😂
Bratz dolls & Barbie movies!
When I was a kid we had a horse thats came with a barbie we bought. So naturally my favorite barbie was the horse and anytime me and my sister played Barbies I would race to get the horse( even though she didn't even want it) and when I would go to a friend's house and they dint have the horse I would get really sad.
18:40  they'll ask you to marry them
imagine trying to pick a Barbie movie to represent the BCU and NOT picking PRINCESS AND THE PAUPER
Who’s gonna tell him that hedwigs a she because I don’t have the heart to
So glad Kurtis saw Barbie Rapunzel. I do believe that Barbie Nutcracker would have broken this man
Outraged comment about the lack of extra greeting.
“do I wanna gnome“😭😭
ya hooo da ba yo
Evan Peters...?
Bratz and Monster High(2010s) are better than every other doll brand out there. Unfortunately Mattel rebranded Monster High and made it super bland
You better review all the other barbie movies now or we'll all elect a new mayor for curtistown
11:02 but Kurtis why are you blushing 👀👀👀👀
does kurtis know that kurtistown is real
I wanna see Kurt's upload his content but unedited
why did you choose the worst barbie and bratz movies?
Barbie and the pegasus was the best Barbie movie. I said what i said.
i love that he's taking this semi seriously, his face in the thumbnail with that moustache looking like an underweight Brony with Bratz and Barbie next to his head and a "Vs" 😭
Excellent movie choices kurtis
WHATS WITH THE NO INTRO 👹👹👹
10:47 those aren't normal human proportions
fashion pixies was the best bratz movie there was no competition from the start, bratz was the clear winner
only videos that genuinely make me laugh
please i swear to god just react to barbie mermaidia 😭😭🙏🏻🙏🏻
yo do you guys remeber that Bratz movie where they go to Paris (I think) for some fashion show, get poisoned and all turn old and ready to die? that shit left me with nightmares when I first watched it...
i still watch barbie and bratz movies to this day 😐
Lokasi gw ubah jadi Australia Ternyata bisa hehe
Kurtis why'd you have to pick that one... princess and the pauper is so much better, your reaction would've been gold
omg the james charles apology video
you really need to watch some of the other barbie movies,,, literally masterpieces rapunzel was the first it wasn’t all there yet!
i was not paying attention to this video at all because i was doing homework, and when kurtis said dylan my soul left my body holy fuck i have never been that scared.
I was obsessed with my Barbie's, growing up. My sister and I had like a super soap opera going on. But, I never watched the lame ass movies! Barbie is supposed to make you use your imagination. Bratz dolls are skanks.
The chaotic good energy that Kurtis is emitting in this video is like 130% more than normal,
God i was so happy when he said “we’re only halfway done”. More of these long ass vids Kurtis pleasee🤩 P.S. why tf did u choose bArBiE aS RapUNzeL?!?! #justiceforbarbiemovies
as a kid i hates the bratz dolls because their head size scared the shit out of me lmao
Thanks for covering a topic that is "supposed to be for girls"
Gonna be honest guys, I thought the title meant he was going to talk about Nicki v Cardi the entire video.
no extra greeting? why am I here then?
I've probably watched this a million times in the 3 or 4 days it's been out
YES I REMEMBER CHALK ZONE, is this a thing that only 27 years old remember? also the passion for being bothered and grumpy about everything but ALSO really understanding and careful of other people opinions and feelings? Oh, we are such millennials.
I’ll never forgive the bratz for stealing my name Yasmine for one of their characters when I was being watched for kids content from my pleasant home in Africa!
ya hooo da ba yo
thats just the worst barbie movie smh
WHERE IS MY EXTRA GREETING?!?!!!? IM CONSIDERED UNSUBBING
okay, but you not choosing the barbie movie with the 12 dancing ballerinas is the biggest mistake you have ever made.
the editing in this video is so good
did you stick barber shop floor hair on your face
bratz is always the winner
i used to make my mom put on the painting scene (forget where it was at in the movie) everynigjt when i went to bed when i was like five. but i havent seen it since then so this is like a punch in the gut why do they all LOOK LIKE THAT
ok now do my scene masquerade madness or jammin in jamaica vs. polly pocket at the pocket plaza or lunar eclipse
5:51 8:34 11:00
“and Dylan twerks about it”
kurtis being bald is not something I ever want to come across again.
barbie movies are SUPERIOR. also kurtis skipped over half of the best moments from rapunzel
The best Bratz movies are Rock Angelz and Forever Diamondz
I wasn't allowed to have Bratz dolls, but because my mom thought it would make me bratty. she thought the name would change my personality.
I always preferred bratz and I watched bratz movies and the show all the time 😂.
"So no head wig?" 😭😭
You should of watched princess and the pauper 😫😫
He reminds me way too much of my lil brother 😂 I want him to be my bestie plzzz
pega ele frita ele faz purê
It’s the no music for me
Hedwig is a girl 😫
In Spanish vrg is a way of writing verga 😩😩😩
damn no extra greeting... wellllll no subscribtion then
I think we're all forgetting the true winners here... MyScene, or the cult classic Groovy Girls
When I was younger I watched the fashion pixies movie and I had a crush on literally all the pixies 😭✋ also, Barbie:Swan Lake is an actually kind of good Barbie movie.
scrotum scrolls had me rollin !!!!!!!!!
The day has finally come when Kurtis reacted to Barbie and Bratz movies. It's a dream come true
When I hit the subscribe button I felt so happy that I will get an extra greeting, absolutely made my day!
hey!!!! i have an interest in ornithology, especially owls.  yes, owls DO get horny. specifically during the spring (in most cases, I’m going off of temperate regions because that’s where I live).
This video is the female gaze
da hoo da ba yo
Kurt just doesn’t understand the cultural significance of the Barbie movies :,)
Wtf I literally have the motorcycle from the brats movie like I never knew where it came from I thought it was just a random toy or smth but it’s from the bratz movie ig lmaoooo
Barbie rapunzel was the whole reason why rapunzel is my fave Disney princess
but the best from both is barbie: the twelve dancing princesses and bratz: fairy tales
Whata that dirt on his face
the first 40 seconds of this were an absolute masterpiece
Honestly Bratz dolls give more of a bad body image than Barbie did in my opinion. At least Barbies size was one that some girls did have whereas Bratz dolls…no one looks like that naturally lol also the Bratz characters (in one of the older movies) said that they were in 8th grade and when they make 8th grade dolls dress and look like that I find that much worse than the classy Barbie doll character. Plus Bratz completely targeted Barbie by making those twin girls while Barbie just kept being Barbie…
Oh my god this was my favourite movie as a kid, it used to look so much better when I thought of it. 😭😭
Big foreheads are gorgeous Kurtis.
Nothing will ever beat Barbie's Princess and the Pauper, and no one will ever change my mind. That movie was a masterpiece!
love you kurtis but barbie OBVIOUSLY can’t leave the tower before that moment because she can’t just jump out the window and the door is locked. PLUS she could never have escaped on penelope’s back before that moment because penelope had never gotten the courage or skills to fly over the magic wall that Gothel created until the end of the movie!!!!!! its almost as if u haven’t watched this movie 500 times ??
I kind of want more videos comparing Bratz movies to Barbie movies. They were both my childhood so I kind of need it
the only reason i subscribed was the extra greeting, you broke the deal!
Kurtis you should have watched Bratz: Genie Magic - the peak of Bratz film.
I remember watching Bratz and I thought it was awesome I was so wrong
Nobody: Nobody at all: Kurtis Conner trynna get his bag: “I’ll be sitting by the phone Mattel😌”
absolutely devestated that you wouldn't give us an extra greeting, already questioning why I subscribed
i was a little sad that he didn’t review barbie diamond castle, i think i speak for all barbie stans when i say we don’t claim rapunzel.
Bless you
he shouldve chosen to watch barbie princess n the pauper or the diamond castle instead of the rapunzel one </3
Maybe these rumours are reffering to this lovely virgin moustache
The editing has always been on point lmaoooooooo omg
My sister and I have always been aficionados of Barbie movies....finally someone who sees the hilarity 😆😆 mine heart is blessed
You should've watched Barbie in The Princess and the Pauper instead hfhfjgjg
Memory unlocked with this Barbie movie omg!
Gnome: YAHUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU DABADOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
b a l l   s c r o l l s
the lack of an extra greeting made me so sad kurtis what was that for
“Rupunzal is bald now” is stuck in my head and will be forever.
Does anyone remember the Bratz: Super Babyz movie?? Kurtis, you need to watch that next, it scarred me for life.
Im impressed how accurate the irish guy is in it
When I was younger I thought bratz dolls were ugly and scary tho
Kurtis review the movie Cool World please!!!!
Hello Kurtis, I went away for three hours to eat ice cream and retrieve my Amazon parcel (which was definitely not a strap on) from a neighbour. I shall now watch the other half of your riveting video :D
Kurtis, please shave that moustache.
Unsubscrib no extra greetin
why didnt u choose super bratz babyz
Bratz dolls but barbie movies
I about to spill some Tea on why those moms hated Bratz, and it wasn’t because they had “unrealistic beauty standards”… It was because they weren’t all white and had non euro centric features like big lips. They perceived them as overtly sexual because they view Black features as inherently sexual and white features as inherently innocent. I say all this because I grew up in Texas and went to a private Christian school where my mom and all of my friend’s moms felt that way. I had never seen a Bratz doll until I moved to a public school and I thought they were cool as fuck but when I asked my mom for one she acted like they literally were stripper dolls that would permanently scar me for life.
This video made me laugh so much
Nahhhhh no ones talking about “Do I Wanna Gmome” 😭😭😭😂😂😂
BUT I SUBSCRIBED FOR THE EXTRA GREETING!! FAKE PROMISES KURTIS, ALL OF THEM, FAKE!
2:51 The greendale flag?
tell me why i gasped when you refused the extra greeting
Stop those footsteps in that scene were my fave as a kid! It was like asmr I swear to god
Hedwig was a girl dummy
“Flying unicorns” if only they had names for those..,
Barbie and the magic Pegasus is buck wild. I highly recommend that one.
The editing in this video is top notch. 👌 Love it. 🥰
i fucking loved bratz when i was a kid. i remember when they came out and people would protest them lmao
Well then why am i subscribed
if we aren’t getting our special greeting what is the point of staying subscribed at this point
Barbie and the nutcracker VS bratz rock Angels next
i unfollowed you, since im not gonna get an extra greeting anyways. i dont see why i should stay in kurtistown. You dissapointed me, a lot
As a Lena myself… i don’t claim her lol
sir you can't watch the first barbie movie you have to watch Farirytopia and Mermaidia!!! Those are the best!!!!
You should watch princess and the pauper barbie movie. Its one of their best movies. Plus the songs are super good 🤠
Hear me out. The music in Bratz Rock Angelz 🤌🏽
Not da stache
🤣
Folla gang ✌🏻
I'm pretty sure that guy who speaks first in the Bratz section is the VA for Pathfinder in Apex.
bratz rock angelz superiority
so no bibble?
Thanks, I hate it all equally.
Always thought Bratz was better ngl
An Arctic Monkeys reference 😭 just when I thought Kurtis couldn’t get any cooler
This should be a series just Curtis comparing random childhood movies
mayor, you dont get it, i was so excited to get an extra greeting and i feel hurt and betrayed that you purposefully went back against your words. i expect an apology by this week, mayor kurtis.
Flying unicorns?!?!?
wtf i want my extra greeting dude
the weasel nominations hahahhaha
The amount of memories that were unlocked is fucking *INSANE*
I WAS ALREADY LAUGHINGA T THE GNOME SCENE BUT THEN KURTIS SANG ARCTIC MONKEYS AND I SCREAMED
The angry twerking had me rolling
ya hooo da ba yo if you know what i mean
the fact that he chose repunzel and not fairytopia is a crime... we deserve a kurtis connor take on bibble idc
The way that Bratz movie had a CHOKEHOLD on my existence when I was a child
19:35
but listen: my scene my scene you know what I mean
i fucking loved the barbie movies when i was a kid, i liked them way more than the bratz movies. tbh the barbie movies were really bad but i still liked em.
can we have a longer version of the matrix dubbed by kurtis?
Hi there, I've never seen anything from you before but I had many a good chuckle to this video
I was rlly excited for the extra greeting :(
When I was 6 I was playing Bratz dolls with my friends and one of them made her doll (the blonde one idk their names) go cry in her room so my other friend's doll (the baby version of the blonde one) saw her and was like "oh my god she's emo" and being 6 years old and the oldest child in my family I obviously had to ask what that meant and my friend, who was a whole 6 years of age, said "it means someone who cries in their room and cuts themself", I still think about that
ayo u forgetting penelope couldn't fly this is slander
I didn't get an extra greeting, I might unsubscribe. Very disappointed, 1/10
have not seen the video yet but i have to say that barbie has the better movies, Bratz has the better doll.
Ok but he should have watched barbie princess and the pauper along with bratz rock angelz 🚶‍♀️
Barbie rapunzel is Elizabeth Smart: the Disney version.
Why does not getting an extra greeting make me feel really bad about myself? I respect Kurtis and his right to not give us one though.
MAKE ANOTHER PLEEEEEEAAASSSEEE this was hilarious! LMAO
wished you watched the Bratz movie where they go to some sort of crack house/abandoned factory thing. not sure if it was a movie or the tv show, but i remember that giving me the creeps
i’m gonna need you to watch bratz sleepover adventure and barbie island princess next please!!
Barbie Rapunzel was my favourite movie as a kid so the weasel bit had me dying here 😹
The dwarf scene is killing me
Kinda irritated that you mentioned Little Soldiers, but failed to discuss if Bratz could beat Barbies in hand do hand combat 😒
watching this at 4am while my family is sleeping was a terrible decision why is everything so fucking funny
i remember watching fashion pixies religiously omg
kurtis i am begging u to review a good barbie movie. princess charm school. mermaidia (NOT mermaid tale). fairytopia. then judge, dummy :(
Its because he didn’t watch barbie and the 12 dancing princesses
is pixie world how the real world looks like when ur on lsd😋
This is such a hard battle because I liked both as a kid, but Bratz Fashion Pixies made me realise I was bi so idk what to do now
10:05 "doth thou carpets match thy drapes" omg kurtis😂💀💀
I dont like either bratz or barbie, I'm a monster high stan all the way
I’m moving out this is devastating
Pls rate all the movies in the Barbie universe
The fact that I had to see a Barbie ad for the first time because of this video
This is the wildest crossover ever, Kurtis and every mid 90s to 2000s girls favorite freaking Barbie movies. Never thought I’d see the day.
*angrily twerking*
Omg my experience with long hair had made it possible for me to help with something for once! When you have really long hair, if you hold it at the base you can prevent things from tugging on it so when Rapunzel wraps her hair around things her hair won't tug or hurt.
*scrotum scrolls*
Barbie Fairytopia is good
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse is a masterpiece of satire and nerdy fun. So wonderfully satirical that it went right over the head of this IMDb mom/reviewer/life long Barbie/Mattel fan. "I am so disappointed that after I had a dialogue with my girls (ages 5, 7, and 9, the Mattel demographic) about why this version of Barbie doesn't send the right message or portray the values we hold dear for girls even they agreed that it's a stupid show. The Barbie movies (back when Kelly Sheridan voiced them, before the new, young, shallow Mattel makeover in 2011) used to portray a better image for Barbie--even if the movies themselves were a little cheesy. We enjoyed those movies, and purchased every one of them. But after the ridiculous Fashion Fairytale, we have rented and rejected every movie since. Judging what I have seen of these recent Mattel productions and especially since seeing two episodes of this awful show, I'm *this* close to jumping on the anti-Barbie bandwagon." 😱😱😱
Kurtis Connor? More like Kurtis Cancelled for not giving us an extra greeting on purpose 🙄
Why am I watching this? I was a tomboy who didn’t play with dolls. I got my brothers’ action figures taking away for informing my parents that action figures weren’t any different than Barbie dolls because the play is still the same.
8:05 anyone else thinking of Germany 1914 👀
But why didn’t he pick princess and the pauper
It’s Virgin really good .
did anyone else have liv dolls with the wigs
I remember saving up my allowance so that I could secretly buy a Bratz doll when I was at a sleepover, we went full CIA mode getting that doll into my house and then my mom found it and was so freaking pissed
I hope Kurtis makes more vids of the Bratz movies, it is so funny. PLEASEE MAKE MORE
i cnt believe i cackled at "do i wanna gnome"
i never thought i'd see a fail fix doll ad on any of kurtis' videos but here we are
The echo for that last " *b a l l s* " lingered way too long and I don't know how to move on from this.
This is kurtis's excuse to watch barbie movies
you should watch the myscene movie!!!
How history repeats itself R.I.P Extra greeting  Never to be forgotten
26:31
21:39 oh my god this is just about the funniest shit ive seen in a while.
I love all the barbie movies but rupunzel and the recent ones were just bad😅 you might like the three musketeers
I would totally sign up for current but it isn’t allowed in my region 🤬‼️👺
This is very controversial
Monster High Is Still And Will Forever Be Superior
Whew, it's a good thing he stopped the video so he didn't give up the fact he's a VRG
you know what..i just wanna give a moment of silence for how FAR KURTIS HAS COME, i have been with this man since forever, and i am so proud of him. Love you kurtis.
growing up I always want to dress like bratz bcs they're so cool and EdGY, and this video made me nostalgic how'd my grandma bought me the PS 2 bratz rock angelz 😭
chipper?? i hardly know er!!!
Please do the princess and the pauper onee 😩😩😩 like we all barbie freaks know that rapunzel is one of the worst
man you would’ve either loved or hated barbie princess and the pauper- no in between
He reminds me of a dad talking to his friends about having to watch the Barbie movie with his kid. Just wildly done with it
do I suppose to do my homework ? yes am i watching kurtis’ 28 minutes and 50 seconds video ? yes    thank you for coming to my TED talk
I love how done Kurtis is with the Barbie movie😂
You should review the Bratz super babies and Halloween movies, they are hella weird, like, it has basically NOTHING on these ones compared to the one u watched, these ones are basically surreal fever dreams
Ngl bratz babiez movies were pretty good.
Kurtis when are you reviewing the best Bratz movie, Bratz Rock Angels?! 'So Good' from the soundtrack is possibly the best song ever recorded
all the bratz movies were 100 percent my childhood
ya hooo da ba yo
i still think ur a virg
Okay but is that Jacob’s bald head photoshopped onto Kurtis?
this video was uploaded on my birthday, the best gift ever. thanks kurtis :D
Not this man dragging Kelly FOR FILTH. But it’s true, Barbie couldn’t have just imagined Kelly a smaller forehead or sum 🤣🤣🤣
8:43 at least he doesn't know about shiver from magic pegasus
Anyone else notice when Kurtis said “assing”?
I feel personally attacked by the fact that you chose the dolls that inspired the Kardashian- Jenner plastic surgeon over BARBIE. But seriously you should check out the other movies.
Wait is it $5000 or $500?
The one where Sasha gets chased through the carnival by her doppelgänger gave me a severe fear of mirrors
Rapunzel was good but holy shit kurtis why didn't u go with Mermaidia or Island Princess or Swan Lake those are so much better
If he thinks the weasel is bad he should watch Princess and the Pauper with Preminger
yay Bratz is elite!!
the fact that you chose THIS barbie movie over the classic that is Barbie Farytopia Mermadia is a damn shame
Not with Barbie Rapunzel 🤺🤺🤺🤺🤺🤺
It’s something about the weasel. This is the hardest I’ve laughed in a while and the reason was a moaning weasel. Should I be ashamed?
Why does Kurtis look like my second grade substitute math teacher with that absolute killer moustache
"Rapunzel Is Bald Now" Full song on all platforms please
Hello, please add more merch to your pbntm collection
So many freaking memories being "Forced" to watch these am I right or am I right???
Bratz will forever be better than barbie, that’s just on period! 🗣
I have admittedly watched multiple compilations of the weasel moaning in different languages without knowing it was from a Barbie movie lol Just so you know some of the voice actors made it less weird and some made it 10x worse
your sketches crack me up bro
God this was such a blast to the past, I used to be OBSESSED with the Bratz movies
Caught that James Charles reference hahaha
I wasnt watching barbie or bratz. The myscene movies were my shit
Ya hooo da ba yo
🎶rapunzel is bald now🎶
where the FUCK is my extra greeting
Review “Drop Dead Fred”.
Say that 10 times fast that that that that that that that that that that
Ok but can we agree that the mermaid+ fairy series were the best barbie movies
PLZ REVIEW BARBIE FAIRYTOPIA RN!!!!!!!! kurtis u better look at this -_-
the dragon was afraid of heights which is why she didn’t fly. DID U EVEN WATCH?
kurtis’s hair is looking good today 😳
I grew up with bratz movies yet always had a bunch of black barbie dolls which all looked the same 😭
I believe in barbie supremacy
in like 2007 my besties and i used to have sleepovers and watch the bratz genie magic dvd and watch it on the tiny screen of my karaoke machine
Kurtis is over here having his action figures watch a show so they will come to life. Meanwhile I'm over here wishing on a shooting start to turn my 2 dollar hair brush into a magic paint brush
All the memories from these movies are just flowing back
barbie was for the future good lil christian girls, bratz was for the future baddies, but u forgot the future emo kids      ... u gotta watch monster high now
I was promised an extra greeting for subscribing... I feel unwelcomed😔
Unbelievable that Quentin Tarantino didn't get the award. The Oscar's truly are rigged
do not watch this high oh my god
im so sorry kurtis but you cant pit the baddest of bitches of the bratz movies against rapunzel its just not a fair fight try princess and the pauper, 12 dancing princesses, nutcracker, , the entirety of the iconic fairytopia series, just. this was not a fair fight
This has absolutely no right being so funny 😭
Did anyone else get water when Kurtis reminded us?
Kurtis, the moustache, not good man
my mom actually said we couldnt get a bratz doll cause they looked unrealistic.
Kurtis not doing the extra greeting is kinda refreshing since it seems like he's tired of it
I thoroughly enjoyed this video👏
I could watch another one of these
Please watch all of the Swan Princess movies 🙏
I've been a Bratz stan literally since birth (01 baybee) and was enthralled when I remembered Dylan lmaooo.. on a side note, I'm so glad with how far animation has come   phew
Nooo Kurtis I was counting on you for that extra greeting!
Make more like this! And tbh I think I like it without the extra greeting too
okay now bratz needs to face off against a monster high movie (why do ghouls fall in love is my favorite but thirteen wishes is very good as well)
YOU ALMOST MADE ME SPIT MY SALAD OUT AOSJDJBDJSJDFB ITS 11:01 MY PARENTS ARE SLEEPING
CHELSEA HATE CLUB
HE SHOULD'VE WATCHED BARBIE PRINCESS AND THE PAUPER VS BRATZ ROCK ANGELS IT SHOULD BE LEGENDS VS LEGENDS ONLY 😭
It just makes me happy to think you're not in control...  COZ YOU'RE NOT AND NO ONE BODY IS. :)
Not having a horrible realization that i remember watching this barbie movie as a child...???? Why do I not remember it being so awkward and cringe
Ya hoo da ba yo ikyk
a flying unicorn is called a pegasus but okay
KURTIS DON'T MOVE THERE'S A CATTOPILLER RIGHT ABOVE YOUR LIP 😱
You should make fun of hockey boys in your next video, your Canadian so hopefully you know what I mean, but if you don't look it up its actually an entire category of its own, they all act talk and dress the same too.
Bless you
the quick James Charles plug
How can anyone be a virgin with a mustache like that!
do more videos with these kind of movies
I got a Poutine
Will I ever stop laughing at scrotum scrolls??? 😂😂😂
There was a chalkzone Rapunzel episode too lmao
the bratz movie seems amazing
now this is my favorite video of kurtis
That Bratz movie is their best movie, mostly because it's a huge trip. (Yes I've seen all their movies.)
alright but my scene movies tho
The Barbie one is built like one of those sims 2 movies
I grew up in provo UT, and I wasn't allowed to have a Bratz doll because they were too over sexualized in the eyes of the Mormon church.
Excuse you, but Hedwig was a GIRL owl. Kanceled again.
Barbie in The Princess and The Pauper (2004) is the best one though
this vid hits kris
I think it takes real courage to watch these films and not go crazy.  PROPS
The brats sleepover movie horrified me as a 4 year old. I was scared for life. Would recommend.
hi virgin 😊
You should react to the monster high movies please god
why tf was i waiting for a punchline saying barbielat
and to all my brazilian babes PEGA ELE, FRITA ELE, FAZ PUREE
Thank you wonderful mayor for twerking so angrily.  It will get me through the year🤣
thank GOD he’s finally leaving out the second greeting. the reaction was so weird when he didn’t do it last time. youtubers who have greetings are often like stuck in their own brand, it’s hard to branch out - and when he did people reacted that way. weird
I INSTA CLICKED
unsubscribing b/c i didnt get my extra greeting. like fr
Kurtis hit a whole new level with that do I wanna gnome joke, and I'm here for it.
This took me back. Now I feel old lol
Genuinely, your videos always have been rlly good. But lately? They've been VERY really good.  nah but fr, it's visible how much effort you put into these and I love watching them. Keep up the amazing work!!
I literally thought this was the coolest movie when I was little
Shouldve watched barbie fairytopia, one of my favorite movies as a kid 😹 or swan lake! I was not a Bratz fan, I was a goody twoshoes kid and I think I always associated bratz with delinquency because of the name lmao. I didn't even know there were bratz movies
I feel uncomfortable ): I want my extra greeting. I earned it.
4/10?? eugh. nitpicking and biased.
not me and my sister being named brianna & kelly LMAO
hedwigs a girl
completely unsolicited reply to the "horny owls" comment: they do get horny, and oftentimes will stay awake hooting during the day. So if you ever hear an owl hooting in the day time, its probably horny.
Barbies are what millennial influencers have morphed into and Bratz are Gen Z E-Girls let’s bring out robot dolls next ready for the AI generation - oh wait they already exist they’re mobile phones. The next gen are literally going to look and act like iPhones can’t wait.
25:23 wood chipper? I hardly know her!
I keep thinking he wants Trixie to call him so they can talk about fake butts...
That mustache poppin off dude
So just a little fun fact about long hair since I have that, yeah it hurts if it’s being tugged on, but if you hold the top part (the hair close to the scalp) and tug on the rest of the hair, it actually won’t hurt. Thing is, you have to have a good grip and not move your hand when being tugged. Not sure of the science of this, but I’m sure there is some bc I have indeed had someone climb on my hair from a tower too
I was a little disappointed he chose barbie as rapunzel because it's not the best barbie movie, but it was worth it just for all the weasel jokes
sounds like something a virgin will say
I had a dream about you last night Kurtis, I hugged you and then we played hide and seek in an office supply store, it was pretty silly and fun 10 outta 10 would recommend
*YA HOO DA BA YO*
Please for the love of my childhood do monster high next- those movies bring back so much nostalgia
That sneeze was brutal bless you
I feel bad for everyone who can't understand portuguese because the weasel in the brazilian version of the barbie movie is just ICONIC FUNNY and a huge meme aroud here
Imagining him and Jenna watching a Barbie movie for ‘research’ is precious. I hope they did
hey kurtis u should check out this one 2000's dating show called dating in the dark, i remember watching a bit of it a long time ago so i cant remember if its interesting tho lmao
Video:is he hard?! He’s so hard right now Add: buy hardwood
Loved the Barbie movies but preferred the Bratz aesthetic!
kurtis
, bestie, this is the worst barbie movie you could have chosen smh wheres the 12 dancing princesses or !!!
I don't know why, but the prince just grabbing Rapuzel's waist like that to pull her up out of the pit is not sitting right. That's so awkward. His nails must've made gashes in her stomach.
I subscribed for an extra greeting, Kurtis.   This is means for unsubscribing, Kurtis.   /j
pega ele.... frita ele... faz purê
give us back the intro or come to the tour 😤
hedwig is a girl
they hate to see a girldoll winning..
me confused at the beginning because my mexican ass thought vrg stood for an abbreviation of a curse word 😭
Barbie was a fashion doll and was created with the proportions of fashion plates
bratz is superior <3
my very first conflict w kurt boy 😤 team barbie all the way, they’re the og
Ok but the music in the Bratz movie was 😘🤌
Monster High? Lol
My parents never let me play with or watch Bratz because they didn’t want me to turn into a Brat…
Lina was everything when I was younger ~ she definitely spoke to my little goth heart
I guess that’s why Kelly changed her identity. Creeped too many people out in the movies.
hi krutid
18:58   LMAO WAIT IT SHOWS A FULLY PLAYED WELCOME TO THE INTERNET WHEN IN THTA EXACT SAME SPOT ON MY RECOMMENDED IS A FULLY PLAYED WELCOME TO THE INTERNET
first video. 1min in. subscribed. how haven’t i seen this man.
GIVE US THE EXTRA GREETING
This is such a great video theres just so many gems
I see just a little something for the girls 🔥
28:47 Bless you kurt.
Small soldiers, toy story, life size. I never didn't think my toys were alive
Okok time to explain the glasses they use to see pixies. Normal pixies can obviously be seen, like the evil pixies that attack that ball. ( *balls* ) But pixies that are disguised as humans, (like the main characters) you need the glasses to see them. You also need the glasses to see what the pixie world is, which I'm pretty sure is the exact same as the normal world except there are pixies and a few small different things.   Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.
The best Bratz movie is Bratz Rock Angelz
19:58  they don't have a nose  baby bratz don't have a nose .  that means bratz nose appear as they grow up .  they don't have a nose
Kurtissss, wtf dude!?!  Cannot sign up for current in CANADA.  This is BALLS.  Great vid btw. 👌
Who hurt you? 🥺
As a kid and now adult with a large forehead I'm ☹️
It’s really important to point that PENELOPE DIDN’T KNOW HOW TO FLY YET
Had me crying with laughter multiple times 😂
I'm mexican, and I always thought that VRG could be "verga" lol
do a my scene movie next
You should do a video on the Rigoletto movie
5:56
i agree that bratz >>> barbie,, but rapunzel, kurtis? cmon man. that was barbie and the 12 dancing princesses erasure. loved the vid though, kurtboy <3
I laughed way to hard at this and loved every minute of it
i’m glad you are doing what you want with the greeting because it seems so tiring saying a paragraph at the beginning of every video
I kin Dylan.
The joke:😂 Kurtis regret for the joke:😂😂😂😂😂😂🥲🥵🤨🕯😎🐢🥵🧊🐢😡😂🧊😂😂😂😂
kurtis this is outta pocket. you chose RAPUNZEL, out of all movies, to go against FASHION PIXIEZ. totally unfair competition here.
The outfits in the bratz movie are so good
I had both of these movies growing up and owned both barbies and bratz dolls. Did not realize how hilarious the dancing was in the Bratz movies 21:40
is no one gonna touch on the fact that rapunzel and stefan are cousins? *alabama vibes intensify*
Monster high dolls r where it’s at . But bratz movies r goated

MORE BRATZ VS. BARBIE!!!!! i love both of their movies
No, because I’m really hurt that Kurtis treated the Bratz girls like side characters in their own movie 😭😭😭 JUSTICE
Kurtis ia ficar doido se conhecesse a Barbie Maconheira
kurtis calling sasha, yasmin, jade, and chloe the "friends" honestly made me wanna fight a lil lmao
hold on i used to love barbie rapunzel and i watched it all the time but i do not remember penelope being so big ? i remember her as like a small little like cat sized dragon not as tall as barbie???
I KNOW you didn’t refer to the bratz girls as “Cymbeline’s friends”🤨🤨🤨
Plz react to the bratz super babies, the characters are so disturbing (he might be done w bratz stuff :( )
not the irish garden gnome "skadadle"
“Scrotum scrolls”
👍
I would watch Fashion Pixies everyday after school until my mom had enough and thru my dvd into the street which later got ran over
I have never clicked on a title faster ....this is a discussion I wanna be apart of
When your name is Kellie…hahahaha
If Kurtis doesn't use Barbie saying "balls" as a recurring sound in his videos I gotta be honest...  I'll be mildly disappointed
sorry kurtis i had to give this is thumbs down. i am a member of kurtis town and did not get my extra greeting i am very sad😕 /j
Uh obviously the best doll is Monster High! 😂 Legit, their older shows and movies were /good/.
MyScene dolls we’re an exact 50/50 combo of bratz and barbies—highly recommend researching. The franchise made a few movies, one called Masquerade Madness, and one called Jammin in Jamaica they were actually INSANE
There’s this new movie called willys wonderland, it’s low budget and most of the acting and editing is pretty bad, but it’s pretty good and you should review it, also it may or may not be a fnaf ripoff
Should have watched princess and the pauper or the island princess Barbie deserved better :(
Kurtis cheated himself by not watching the Bratz Secret of The Lamp movie
ya hooo da ba yo
you picked the pixie bratz movie.. disgrace.
Can everyone please stop liking the video? I keep falling into holes
I need Kurtis to react to Barbie life in the dream house
Why does the pixie world look like it’s on acid?
if you look at the part in the barbie movie where the prince climbs up her hair, she has it wrapped around a stone bar in between the windows and that alleviates the pressure on her scalp so it wouldnt hurt actually. Like when you brush tangled hair you wrap a section around your hand or brush at the top and brush the knots out at the bottom you wont feel it at all or as much.
Bruhhhh Barbie rapunzel is my favorite Barbie movie, 4/10???????? Cmon bruh 😦🙄🙄😴😪😪😪
the irish from the gnome? immaculate. i loved how he used the letter S to make a word that was already plural plural <3
NO THE BARBIE MOVIE WAS SO GOOD AS I KID-
Can’t believe no ones talking about “so no hedwig?”
my mom never me play with bratz dolls so i became one
Wtf where’s my extra greeting
The JC shade lmfaooooo
CANCELED he didn’t even do the extra greeting
Lovin the stache Kurtis
Hedwig is a girl 😡
you should've picked the princess and the pauper or barbie island princess over barbie as rapunzel 😩
please please please get rid of your mustache please I'm begging you
Barbie vs Bratz but MYSCENE was the best
You should compare bratz and barbie games! They both have fond places in my heart.  Honestly I'd say Bratz was more like a more "grown up" doll. I loved the bratz PS2 game but my mom made me return it at gamestop when my little sister learned the word "stupid" from it :/
9:33 actualyl no, if you have long enough hair to wrap it around an anchor point, all the weight will be taken by the anchor point and not your scalp. I know this because I used to have long hair and when people tried to pull my hair in fights all I had to do was wrap the hair closer to my hear around my own arm and they couldn't cause me pain. It's all about where the pressure is being applied, hair is literally just a rope that happens to be attached to your head. A lot of rapunzel stories depict her wrapping the hair over a hook or around a bar in the window frame before casting it down.
I love how his main points of liking the movies all had to do with the dads :,)
Doth thy carpet match thy drapes? 💀💀💀
there was SO MUCH mdma in that bratz rave
This is MyScene erasure
Can’t stop thinking about that weasel
I think people likely did not like Bratz bc it’s traditionally POC-centric looks. Particularly African American.
the nostalgia hit me like a ton of bricks lmfao
10:29 PENELOPE is afraid of HEIGHTS OKAY
feels like I've watched two movies in 28 minutes
Bratz >> Anyday
Beat Barbie flair, only on food network
Unsubscribed.I needed that extra greeting to feed my family.
And now I need Kurtis watching Barbie life in the dreamhouse
“Could a virgin have a podcast?”   A virgin would have that stash my good sir it looks like a giant eyebrow
18:44
In the 4 years I’ve had watching your vids this is peak content
“Scrotum scrolls”
scrotum + scroll = scrolltum
that gnome joke was deadass the funniest thing ever.
I was raised with both, but bratz were the real deal, cuz with barbie she basically used her friends to get her happy ending. But with bratz they work together and help each other, there not just one main character.  Just my opinion, ✨bratz team 😌✨
I spotted several H3 soundbites lol
GO WATCH BARBIE PRINCESS CHARM SCHOOL RN!!
I would like to say that the brats are much more than Brianna's "friends". girl they the stars in every movie
As a poc, I grew up preferring Bratz because they looked like me and because of y2k, they dressed like the girls I looked up to
i can't believe i missed notif for upload🧍‍♀️ welp whatever i now have something to listen to when i make lunch noodles 👩‍🍳
stop this Penelope slander... the reason they didn't fly away years ago was because Penelope couldn't fly. We'll be expecting a formal apology on the virgin podcast immediately.
*Forgotten Memories have resurfaced*
Kurtis called me a jerk so i will not be leaving a comment like he asked when he called me a jerk
Barbie as Rapunzel was my favorite Barbie movie!! I was obsessed with Penelope even though she was annoying
Someone’s picking up on all those barbie meme compilations showing up
This is wayyyy too funny 😂
watch barbie princess charm school and you'll change ur mind i promise
You should have seen the Bratz game for  Wii
“Very really good” so… Virgin
Your review of the bratz movie had me dying
I grew up with Barbie but I liked bratz dolls more as a kid ngl
Why did you choose to watch one of the WORST Barbie movies in the BCU
Dear kurtis, I live less than one mile from the worlds largest garden knome pictured in you video………..when I was little I had dreams about it chasing me.
No extra greeting no subscription 🤷‍♂️
bratz is better and i’m happy i sat 28 mins to hear kurtis agree with me
frick kelly all my homies hate kelly
only a virgin wouldn't give an extra greeting
YASSS HE CHOSSE THE BEST BARBIE MOVIE
JSGKSHD YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW OBSESSED U WAS WITH THAT BRATZ FAIRY MOVIE I SWEAR LENA WAS MY GAY AWAKENING AAH
My little sister watched the Barbie as Rapunzel movie for her birthday party and I laughed so hard at one of the parts that my sister still gives me a hard time about it: Gothel points her finger at a painting, it levitates and shakes around before it explodes into pieces. She does the same thing with some brushes or something, they levitate, shake, and explode. Then GOTHEL POINTS AT THE TALKING RABBIT, BARBIE'S FRIEND, HE LEVITATES AND SHAKES AROUND, SCREAMING "NNOOOOOOO!!!" but Barbie steps in the way to keep him from exploding!? I just cannot get over the fact that she was going to murder her friend in front of everybody. It's so good.
PLEASE watch the princess and the pauper barbie movie it's so iconic
the gnome was literally niall horan in his past life.
Barbie has no butthole. So sick of these unrealistic booty standards for women.
Not trying to ruin the joke, but her hair is wrapped around the window column, so her head isn’t under any tension at all.
Kurtiboy, Hedwig is a girl.
No Barbie is a winner
i love the old barbie movies but my god why do the character models for the kellies look like that??? the actual dolls looked much cuter than the cgi models.
So I showed THAT to some dudes that said white guys have no rhythm. You know I just showed them the word that. Needless to say they were speechless. You were right Kurtis!
How to know if someone is virgin? When they try to make everyone know that they are NOT virgins!
I preferred MyScene dolls myself
"rapunzel is bald now" should be in spotify
Barbies Life in þe Dream House is pretty good but Bratz wins þe movies for sure
gosh kurtis is literally the biggest soy boy i’ve ever seen in my life. i hate this channel now.
Kurtis, you accidentally forgetting the extra greeting is one thing, we could look past that because everyone makes mistakes. But to blatantly ignore the extra greeting is unacceptable. #KurtisConnerIsOverParty2
You should watch a monster high movie next!!!
😐 where is my greeting
Virgin?  More like _virginA_ , which is like totally a thing I totally hav... did... got... that I got a lot--that I get a lot, just like so much of...  So much vir--so many virginas...in my life.  Heh.
Kurtis sexualizing Otto is life
SCROLL-TUMS
Ya hooo da bo yo
kurtis why does your ear look like that
You should have watched Barbie Princess and the pauper
barbie
kurtis i am begging you do a monster high movie sincerely, a monster high fan who knows the movies are ridiculous sometimes
my scene movie review plssssss
hmmm vrg kinda seems like he’s dropping hints that he’s a virgin 😟
Actually in the original German version rapunzel twists her hair around a hook, so it won't pull on her head
petition to make kurtis watch every single barbie movie
1:27 I wasn’t expecting
Ok the whole 'over sexualizing dolls' I get it but barbie is a white girl who is everyone's favorite has one black friend in every movie and mostly white girls yea barbie might be more suitable but Bratz had diversity and wasn't 'I want a prince (aka ken) like Bratz shows things tht like different races, different styles, how u don't have to be so fucking preppy I'm sorry but barbie will always be 2nd sorry not sorry 💝 EDIT: omg dude I've never watched u b4 but ur hilarious 😂 I'm subscribing
kurtis you have made some very powerful enemies today
18:44
That angry twerk scene killed me
this was one of ur finest videos and ur hair looks great
KURTIS THIS IS LITERALLY ONE OF YOUR FUNNIEST VIDEOS I FIND MYSELF CAKCLING EVRY FEW SECONDS
Watching this while waiting for Jenny Nicholson’s Barbie movie ranking video.
VERY FUN
ok but barbie princess charm school slaps.
The hair physics in the bratz cinematic universe deserves an Oscar.
Bratz will always be my favorite because me and my cousins were the Sasha, Jade, Chloe, and Yasmine. Our personalities and hobbies weirdly represented all the girls and we all got to be on of them. We would always play the forever diamondz game on the Ps2. However, Princess and the Pauper is one of my favorite movies of all time and easily tops anything bratz did. But I do admit bratz had more flavor. In conclusion Barbie movies are the best and Bratz dolls, games, and shows are the best. Next time do a different barbie movie too because that one had no flavor. Princess and the Pauper, Diamon Castle, there a ton of better ones (except for the new ones) and barbies life in the dreamhouse is really good, however I loved the bratz better.
i can’t stop laughing at the angry twerking
unsubscribing until I get my extra greeting back
I feel like kurtis should just review more Barbie movies I would watch for sure
That Barbie Rapunzel movie was my favorite growing up. I have no clue how many times I watched it but I was obsessed. This analysis is so good 😂
Happy you’re not doing the second greeting Bc you don’t feel like it. Your channel, you choose your content to put up. Say what you want
is that not a ferret?
8:37 this animation is the fire that fuels depressive episodes
AHAHA Barbie Wire is a character in Helluva Boss
Never watching another kurtis video in class got me sounding like the Barbie weasel trying to contain my laughter smh
The Bratz movie really reminded me of Fairy Secret but idk
kurtis you should have watched bratz rock angelz, that’s a masterpiece
Hedwig is a chick btw
Stephan’s king sent Wilhelm an unsolicited ball scroll
Also I cannot believe Kurtis went this entire video and didn't make a single joke on the fact that Barbie's original 1960s design was based off of a German 'adult novelty' doll called Bild Lilli who was literally label an 'escort' or 'call girl' in her advertisments lmao.
*sounds like something a virgin would say*
wtf i never knew barbie tried to sue bratz LMFAOOOO WHAT
watch barbie mermaidia or princess and the pauper
dude the fucking barbie Rapunzel movie. i remember that movie scene by scene that was my fav movie as a kid
Thank you for showing us where the “ give him to me, ugh” line came from
why is kurtis unironically following the shrek 3 storyline at 10:16
The bratz one reminds me of the barbie fairy secret movie
why is it so hard for parents not to sexualize their kids and what toys they play with??
NO PLEASE DONT STOP THE EXTRA GREETING :(
I MISS THE PLAQUES
You should’ve watched Princess and the Pauper for the Barbie movie. That’s one of the best ones lol
As someone who owns and has watched all of the Barbie movies and absolutely none of the Bratz, they will always be superior to Bratz 😤😤
Would a virgin have this mustache? Or THIS curly mullet?
barbie wire….. or barbed wire but pink❓
Someone asked me what i was doing while watching this video and i straight up had to explain that i was watching a grown man talking about Barbie and Bratz and which one is better
The Brat’s movie music hits hard
OMG I didn't know I needed this video till I saw it
Bratz fashion pixies was my favorite movie as kid. Still slaps.
:((( sad without my extra greeting there sir
The kids that play with Bratz are gunna end up being little nicki minaj clones
They changed Kelly's name 😩 its Chelsea now
oh! i had a horrifying little doll version of that child with the bow and arrow! he had an awful bowlcut and i hated him.
these were my two fav movies as a kid omg
When Barbie tried to sue Bratz I, as like a nine year old, boycotted barbie. For a while my best friend and I refused to play with or get barbie dolls.
Omg chalk zone holy shit
Honestly wasn’t expecting too much from this vid but it was an absolute banger!
i love the child slander in this video!
Bro some of those early Barbie movies were crazy I stg
That is my favorite bratz movie ever 👊🏾😩
You had me crying from laughter. OH MY GOD ITS FUCKING KELLY
i was absolutely a barbie kid when i was younger but i really wanted to be a bratz kid bc they actually had dolls that looked like me but my mom only bought me barbies :(
You guys... are we in the 80s?
I’m a virgin and I have a podcast 😡😡🤬
Bro you forgot the fact that Penelope was afraid to fly until the end.
missed opportunity to say scrolltums
ngl Barbie the princess & the pauper and Barbie fairytopia were THE SHIT. also bratz rock angelz was the best one too 😳
I watched Barbie as Rapunzel so many times when I was younger.
Bless you.
when monster high is better than both
The Bratz movies were my primary source of escapism as a kid
I definitely work for Barbie. This is a great idea, and we have *big* things coming, don't ask don't mattel.
damn it had to be barbie rapunzel and not the 12 dancing princesses?? not the princess and the pauper?? that shit goes SO mf hard
disappointed because you didnt react to bratz super babies
The glasses! It's basically a "They Live" remake. lmao
hedwig is a GIRL OWL
I remember that barbie movie, but it looked sooo much better in my memories 👁️👄👁️
NEVER Release Your PRISONER WITH A LYING HEART
Hahahah the weazel

didnt expect to see an Irish gnome who spoke Irish tbh
i had to watch this vid three times cuz i fell asleep thrice
Unsubscribed
ya hooo da ba yo
A job well done my boy. I just laughed way too long for way to loud at work.
YOU PICKED THE WORST BARBIE MOVIE BYE
I just died 23:41
does anyone else remember that Barbie dog that shit?
honestly bratz super babyz was fucking awesome i would rewatch that shit and id still watch it now u should watch that instead bruh bratz always better than barbie literally just cuz theyre cooler
This made me want to watch a Bratz movie now
woodchipper? i hardly know her!
Finally, a movie casting an actual Irish person to play an Irish role. To that I say "Yahoo ya baiyo"
the gnome joke was absolutely amazing
IM PISSING MY PANTS THIS IS THE FUNNIEST VIDEO IVE EVER WATCHED
The Bratz movies are lit
guys he’s not a virgin!
my humor is destroyed i just about pissed myself laughing everytime she said "balls"
no competition
I love the sneeze at the end! 10/10 👌 ya hooo da ba yo
my favorite brats movie
Omg my childhood
10:18 millennial woop  you did it. you dunnit
I can’t believe you didn’t do the best Barbie movie ✨Princess and the Pauper✨ 😭😭😭
omg the memories that that fuckin brats movie brought back. i remember the animation being… much better
bratz fashion pixiez is one of my favorite movies to this day. idk why but it’s stuck ssoooooooo close to me since i’ve been a child
If I’m not getting an extra greeting I’m unsubscribing
this was the only Barbie movie I ever had on DVD and I could never remember the name but I remembered pieces of it vaguely and up till now I thought it was just a really big fever dream.
“I’m not a virgin… anyways listen to my podcast-“
Please watch bratz rock angels next please I’ll do anything I’ll even pay you
Bratz kids fairy tales was one of the best movies in my childhood
i’m a monster high gal myself
Honestly tho, I think YAHOOB YABALOH
“So no Hedwig?” Throws phone 😂
A - all H - hydrants A - are G - gnomes
This animation is so shitty it gives me depression
Bro if u watch these u gotta try a Monster High movie
Unsubbing until i get an extra greeting
you guys are forgetting about the vastly superior dolls, monster high dolls.
why are all the evil pixies goth
Omg bratz pixies was my favorite movie...... I honestly love bratz so much more than any barbie movies
I had a Barbie laptop and I loooooved it
You look like 6/7 of the Chicago 7
bro if you wanna critique a good barbie movie you’ve gotta see princess and the pauper. don’t get me wrong- rupunzel goes hard but princess and the pauper is so fun
BALLS *says a barbie voice in the distance*
Where is my goddamn extra greeting
kurtis, we love you, but i could not agree more with the people saying you should've chosen a different barbie movie AAAUUUGHHH fairytopia!!! mariposa!! thumbelina!! so many fairy movies to choose from that would actually compare !  im defo a huge fan of the OG ones such as rapunzel and the nutcracker n things, they exposed me to classical music and ballet at a young age which are now things that are a part of my career,.,.,.,., BUT i feel like they can't compare to Bratz movies- different vibes, man  loved the video still kurt but as a barbie connoisseur i am feeling a bit gatekeep-y today <3
Smh. He should’ve watched Barbie and the 12 dancing princesses and the bratz sleepover adventure.
i would love for you to make a video on monster high animated stuff
Ok, so how did Mother Gothel get stuck in the tower when Rapunzel just walked out?
The Scotum-Scrolls V : Skyrim
i love how he screams whenever he sees a child in the barbie movie
If you think the animation for Rapunzel is bad then you need to see barbie diaries because that movie looks like absolute garbage
Are you fucking crazy monster high any day of the week
v e r y    r e a l l y    g o o d
bruh i have recommended this and been DYING TO SEE IT yeSss i fucking love these movies
The Bratz and Barbie movies were great to little me, but now I'm just kinda like "no stop". I do still like the plots tho so they should reanimate them lol.
hi
I remember when I was a little kid and I'd pretend my Barbies were going on a prom date thing, but I thought Ken looked ugly so I'd use a small lucario figurine instead.          I ended up having a furry phase all the way through middle school and high school lmao
Deayyummn Kurt over here pullin the reigns. “Once the mullet hits the shoulders, I’m telling that second greeting to fuck off”
i couldn’t stop laughing, great video kurtis! :)
maybe it’s just me but is kurtis ok? some things he does in this video are kind of concerning
Now I want him to watch a Monster High movie-
No extra greeting = No respect
what about island princess??? that barbie movie is lowkey so good
I never saw this coming 😭🤧

also you should’ve done barbie and the magic of Pegasus cause tHAT one was my favorite I watched it like every other day
Should have done fairtopia. Bubble makes the movie
Took Kurtis approximately 5 minutes to forget Chelsea's name n call her Kelly
noooo the Rapunzel is like the worst one
“Mattel me that” is genius
I miss the regular intro tho://
ya hooo da ba yo
Kurtis, i know this is a lot to ask, but can you pleeease review the Barbie in Princess and the pauper movie to have a rematch with bratz? XD I Swear to you you'll enjoy the villain in that movie so much!!
11:05 IM SCREECHING WTF IS THAT
You should have chosen Barbie in mermaidia or Barbie princess and the pauper
There’s like a ton of better Barbie movies like the princess and the pauper and twelve dancing princesses.
i just dont know how you chose the driest barbie movie out of all of the good ones
Kel Lauren designed the merch? This is one of the greatest crossovers I've ever seen
Can a virgin have a podcast... *cough cough* thedooo
Not me realising that instagram face looks exactly like bratz dolls
Ya know I stopped watching his channel for awhile just cuz I thought he was dragging out jokes a bit to much and it felt a little slow to me, but this video was Halarious! I’m glad I decided to watch he’s really improved his content lately (at least in my eyes). I’m gonna sub, nice work man
Myscenes were better
YOURE 27?! you look like youre 20
Bratz fashion pixies is the best bratz movie
21:26
JHOPE THE RABBIT????
Please watch Bratz Babyz
Kelly looks like Lola from Big Mouth
why didn’t you do your homework? You see, a crow stole my backpack
kurtis dubbing matrix timidly >>>>>>>
I’ve watched all the Barbie movies MULTIPLE times. But I have only watch one Bratz movie. It was the baby sleepover one and it TRAUMATIZED OMG
I got way too excited to see the Fashion Pixiez cover 😂😂
I can’t believe you chose the one barbie movie I was obsessed with as a kid I’m having massive nostalgia 😭
Barbie swan lake or Barbie nutcracker next
Kurtis should definitely do a Monster High vs Ever After High video next 😳🙏
when i was a kid i wanted that goddamn magic paintbrush SO BAD
the regret after “do i wanna gnome” i’m cryingg
Of course you are not a virgin Kurtis! How can someone with that absolutely bangin' hairstyle and a 'stache be a virgin? I think not!
Bald Connor is definitely gonna be appearing in my nightmares.
Okay the fact that Kurtis asked "Does the carpets match the drapes?" with a red wig is accurate. That is always one of the first things males ask once they know I have red hair. Hell I've even had men shout it at me while they were driving.
why did you have to choose the WORST BRATZ MOVIE THERE IS😭 also i’ve grown up with these movies n i didn’t remember them looking like a person on mushrooms produced them
Petition for Kurt to watch more animated toy films
>:((( no extra greeting i ak so angy im gonna cry, i subscriebed forsn an extra greetint tive me what i paiud for!!!! how dayre you kurtis!!!!!!!!       /j but also im not joking kurtis please never do that again
i cant believe you didnt give ME an extra greeting i syubscribed specifically for it. I will stay subscribed tho
This it is the man who tried to sue me for making Monday.
You have got to watch Bratz Starin' and Stylin' next solely for the fact that they have NO NOSES AND ITS NOT EVEN ADDRESSED
Heartbroken that he didn’t choose a good barbie movie like Princess and the Pauper that has banger after banger
“doth thou carpets match thou drapes” IM SCREAMING 💀💀
Her chopped off hair looks like a ramen brick
Pega ele, frita ele, faz pureeeee
Something felt off in this one. You okay, Kurtis?
You NEED to watch Princess and the Pauper, you will NEVER get those songs out of your head, but in a good way.
Please watch princess and the pauper the barbie movie !!!!!!!! that shit slaps
But how do you not have any fucking dark circles
I haven’t finished the video I’m just hoping he watches Princess and the Pauper instead of Just Rapunzel
To give a bit of retrospect with repunzels hair climbing, ive seen somewhere she ties it on a hook next to the window(so it wouldnt be straight from her head)
Oh, my god. I remember "Barbie as rapunzel." Looking back on it, it's absolute shit. I remember it as super high quality, I also remember the stairs squeak (people who have seen the movie understand).
7:52 Anyone gonna point out that this man can wrap both of his hands around Barbie's waist and his fingers overlap? If that ain't unrealistic beauty standards then I don't know what is-
I'm too old for having experienced these movies but now I kinda wanna watch some haha. I vaguely remember my younger sister watching barbie movies and they always creeped me out. But there was one about a bunch of princesses dancing ballet that made me stop and look a little! I'm classically trained and was a little impressed by how accurately they captured movements, considering the weird animation design.
ya hooo da ba yo
✨Do i WaNna GNoMe✨🤌🏽
errrrm Kurtis. my dude, hate to burst your bubble but Hedwig. Hedwig shes a female. oh my god I'm dying of laughter
Scrotum Scrolls
do a part 2 with barbie 12 dancing princesses and bratz sleepover. that’s a real competition.
if you remove Monday from the equation, Tuesday becomes the new Monday
kurtis this is ur funniest video please make more
literally the funniest video i love kidnapping people who haven't grown up with this shit and make them react no i wont loosen the ropes kurtis shut up and watch barbie 12 dancing princesses
you’re one of THOSE sneezers 🙄 ok
Still can’t believe that’s how the awards went..Quentin Tarantino was robbed of “horniest weasel.”
i subscribed for that extra greeting and now you're not giving it?? harsh bro
kurtis u need to watch barbie princess and the pauper and i promise u will feel very differently my guy
I really dont know how to feel about "Do i wanna gnome"
Thought he meant the globe in the background being the reason everyone was calling him a virgin. Had to do a replay that section 💀
Bibble    enough said I believe
you should’ve watch the princess and the pauper that movie is TOPTIER
kurtis please do the barbie mermaid movie please
the kids that came to watch an actual barbie vs. bratz review are so confused rn
I can't get over that dude just completely wrapping his hands around barbies waist and they just hyper focus on that umm...gross
i wish for the bit about the giant gnome he would’ve used the clip from the first episode of gravity falls pls omg
it’s okay. I don’t need an extra greeting today. *clicks on another one of his videos*
YOU SHOULD HAVE NOT DONE RAPUNZEL YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE THE PRINVESS AND THE PAUPER
you really picked the worst barbie movie AND the worst bratz movie. cancelled
Barbie and bratz brought back alot of memories I had a barbie shirt Barbie dolls and then I got a few bratz
He should review the animated Winx Club tv show
i hate you
Content🔽🔽🔽🔽🔽🔽 Quality  ⏏️⏏️⏏️⏏️⏏️⏏️
but Kelly  IS REAL!!
how dare you not give me an extra greeting
you forgot about myscene dolls 😭 it was basically Mattel's equivalent to the counter-reformation
Should’ve watched Barbie princess and the pauper
Maybe rapunzel has a hair pulling kink and that's why she doesn't mind
please watch bratz: super babyz PLEASE
14:27 what is that head ???
i just recently finished watching game of thrones and now i'm tripping, that one king in the barbie movie reminds me of king robert baratheon
more more more more more moreeeeee
I’d pay a lot of money for Kurtis to review all these movies, my guy.
Barbie vs bratz idc but  M o n s t e r h i g h.
DID ANYONE ELSE WATCH THE BRATZ MOVIE WHERE ITS LIKE A HORROR MOVIE KIND OF AND THEYRE AT LIKE A CARNIVAL OR SOMETHING
um...you might have a problem here. i've said this time and time again, but kurtistown is a town in Hawai'i. obviously our is better, but what do we do about the other one?
my HÖUSe
rly appreciate how rapunzel n the dude save a kid n immediately begin talking abt politics
I loved both of these movies when I was younger so this video is awesome
SCROTUM SCROLLS HAHAHWHEBABAH
the animations were top tier when I was young???? is this really the same thing???
Can you please voice over a whole movie, thanks
no extra greeting... smh my head this is my 13th reason
Is Kurtis forgetting there’s a baby alive doll that has a working asshole that shits 😭😭
I vote for Monster High 🤷‍♀️
As Queen Bee said in the Savage remix: "I'm a bad bitch, she's a savage, no comparison here" -Beyoncé 2020
0:20 I thought the question would be "could a virgin have this moustache?" and of course the answer would be no.
okay but he should've watched barbie and the fairy secret, just saying
I was definitely a Bratz girl over a Barbie girl
KURTIS PLEASE DO A VIDEO ON ANNOYING AFK ARENA ADS
These films were childhood
Allow me mistress mhhh 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀👀👀👀👀
No unexpected greeting?!? Unfollow!! (Jkjk love you)
you a creep 💯
LMAOO Y IS THE GNOME IRISH
kurtis I'm sorry to say that I have a complaint. after you finished watching Barbie as Rapunzel, you said that we should take a quick break, maybe get something to drink, while you discussed your merch... I was about to pause the video but.. I decided to take you up on your offer and refill my water bottle. however , when I came back from doing so, you had already started watching the Bratz movie? I found this very rude and unprofessional.... smh my head, my guy. please do better.  /s
Nahhooon ianma hooo
Why tf did you chose the worst Barbie movie to review
that do i wanna knome joke was so bad i actually flipped off kurtis from the screen
I love both!! Barbie and Bratz are my besties
i had a failfix doll ad in this video, looks like someone wants to compete
Hey Kurtis, if you’re in the mood for terrible cgi movies, you should check out Dwegans and Leprechauns! The trailer’s up on YouTube but I don’t remember where it’s streaming anymore, so you might have to do some digging around.
okay listen kurt boy barbie rapunzel has the plot point that her dragon sidekick can’t fly bc she doesn’t believe in herself yet !!
Otto the weasel has his own religion.  AS HE SHOULD
E Pluribus Anus!
finally a content creator who understands his fans
React to the Bratz babys movies, they were honestly my childhood
Could you do a review on little Hercules 3D you do commentary on terrible movies the best and that movie is a bonafide crapfest lol
Barbie as Repunzel is absolutely better in every shape and form
I grew up with princess and the pauper, pegasus and 12 dancing princesses 😔 barbie has a special place in my heart
DOST THOU CARPET MATCH THY DRAPES???
Kurtis looks like a football player from the 80s but i'm not complaining
My name is Kelly and I have a big forehead.....0_0
Bratz were the bad bitches.
The fact you have a hairdo like that SHOWS that youre not a virgin, I mean literally every person I know with a curly mullet is getting it big time (not even kidding)
im DEAD, i was laughing so hard
I loved the barbie movies as a child, but one thing that makes me kinda sad nowadays is that some of them are really anti-semitic. Rapunzel is on thin ice (Gothel's character design with it being a fairytale about stealing a child; blood libel), but Swan Lake is the really bad one.
Groovy Girlz(tm) all the way
MyScene goes to hollywood next?
Kurtis kinda looks like stampy
he literally chose 2 of my favourite bratz and barbie movies THANK YOU SO MUCH SUCH A THROWBACK💜 that song in the pixie party scene is actually so fckn dope i remember absolutely jamming my ass off to it
ya hooo da ba yo
some of the more usual barbie movies are so good tho, he should have watched spy barbie or smt like tgat
21:58 just leaving this here for me
I always preferred Bratz as a kid bc of their different personalities, their friendship, their cooler outfit choices, the music, and more. My favorite was Sasha for her work ethic and fierce attitude. Barbie is a classic and has evolved with the time, but she's too much of a one-woman show, and by that I mean her friends and family who she has in different shows and movies are nothing more than an extension of her. It's not a bad thing, but a lot of dolls today comes in groups, so buying one doll from that line feels like a collectable fictional individual while Ken and others feel like an accessory unless you diverge them from Barbie. Like making Ken gay instead of Barbie's boyfriend. Otherwise you wouldn't really bother buying a doll from the line unless you like Barbie or it's the most convenient/cheap doll to get for a little kid.
Hey you don't look like Dr. Kurtis Conner from the amazing Spider-Man!1!!1!1!!!!!1!!!!!?
I hated them both tbh
ya hooo da ba yo✨
Bless you
“DYLAN WALKS SO EBOYS COULD RUN THEIR FINGERS THROUGH THEIR HAIR”
No extra greeting say sike
do a video about monster high too!
ya hooo da ba yo
Disliked because no extra getting
i had an ad for failfix dolls
I feel so betrayed!! I only subbed Kurtis for extra greetings... Not for his humour
Release the VRG white track jacket you coward!!!!!
I remember getting that barbie rapunzel movie when I was 7 for Easter and I thought it was amazing 💀(also if kurtis hates the look of Kelly so much he would hate to watch the twelve dancing princesses bc they all look like Kelly lol)
ya hooo da ba yo
2:54 what is greendales flag doing there kurtis?
U SHOULD HAVE DONE THE DIAMOND CASTLE AND FOREVER DIAMONDZ😔😔
I’ve had “Rapunzelll is bald noooow” stuck in my head for two days, and would like to hear an extended version of what will surely be this generation’s anthem, please.
ya hooo da ba yo
FLASH WARNING 21:30-22:22
I never want to see bald Kurtis again..
I've genuinely never laughed more at one of his videos
Cymbeline said ✨🧚🏼‍♀️✨
✨do i waAAnnna gnooooOmmee✨
I ask you for a minute of your time to help me fulfill my dream of being an artist for the short time I have left in life I have cancer and I am disabled without friends why I cannot leave my house because of the bullying that they do to me why I was not lucky enough to have a good physique but I love myself as I am because that was what I got blessings and God bless you all
*Why was the Bratz movie the only thing I remember from my childhood*
“Kelly falls into a hole where they *unfortunately* save her life” nah I’m sorry I burst out laughing here 😭😭😭😭
:0 We need a comparison of Winx and Monster High omg  Both amazing, both better than Barbie and Bratz
i had a giant collection of bratz dolls in large part from my mom & steppdad and so my dad, in true motorcycle-obsessed Dad Fashion, got  me THAT blue motorcycle (which played music I think!! the sexy blue convertible car did!) god i loved their items and accessories lol, i only had one dylan and one blonde boy tho, i made all the girl bratz be in love with each other  lol also yes the inclusivity and controversial attitude and strange style of 00s fashion kept me coming back <333
I think I had nightmares about Gothels eyebrows when I was younger.
Funniest video I've seen in ages
PRINCESS AND THE PAUPER PLEASE
_Bratz: Go to Paris the Movie_ was a cinematic masterpiece and this just gave me the motivation to watch it again for the twelfth time. Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
What got me was Dylan dancing 😂😂😂
Omg I gotta get high and watch the Bratz movie 😂😂😂😂😂 This video is so funny by itself tho 😂😂
RUDY’S GOT THE CHALK!
Myscene is better than Barbie and bratz combined
You make me laugh so much. Thanks kurtis ahah.
the thumbnail unlocked a core memory lol
Not even 4 minutes in and I've already guffawed loudly like 5 times... people next door aren't gonna like me
These movies were such a pivotal part of my childhood. I’m 20 and I’ve always loved them. I would dream of watching them with my friends. I can’t explain how happy it makes me that they’re getting so much recognition nowadays. My sister and I would make fun of Bratz’ characters’ dancing all the time. I never thought I’d see a Kurtis video about this topic.  All of this to say that the angry twerking is the hardest I think I’ve ever laughed. I was SOBBING with laughter and my eyes and nose hurt. Just...thank you for this, Kurtis
26:23 😭😭😭
barbie good. video bad. next time try watching all the barbie movies as a 7 year old girl and then maybe i'll take you seriously. tch...
This video has been hilarious. I think it's the nostalgia.. y'know coming back to see these movies I've known as a kid as an adult? It's great.
Bruh Moments 1:17 2:43 3:24 3:37 5:55 sure, you’re not a virgin... 6:35 7:00 7:13 8:23 9:05 9:18 10:19 10:40 11:56 13:31 14:04 15:54 16:10 18:42 19:09 19:27 21:24 25:01 26:30  Edit: Dude, how drunk was I when I wrote this comment?
18.31 best joke in the vid
Omg I thought I was the only one thinking about the word virgin when I see those letters although I know about the podcast lmao
this video changed my life
When you said “you doin ok? “ I lost it
I cannot. This made me laugh so much. wonderful video
Two Queens shouldn't fight
this video is awesome
Just saw this on trending and checked your YouTube channel and saw you have episode story reading videos , watched them all and back here.  In conclusion: you're funny.
Kurtis my man, you picked like the worst barbie movie. Princess and the Pauper is legit and has some banging tunes. The Pearl Princess has a terrifying plot, and Princesse Charm School is unexpectedly political. I call a rematch! Also, the animation in Barbie and her sisters in a Ponytail is high key atrocious for the faces.
Next video will be your 200th let’s gooo
But like imagine barbie telling Kelly the story and she imitates the weasel “Then the weasel went Aumhhhh”
This is the best thing I’ve ever seen in my life !!!! Literally couldn’t stop laughing man ur too good
not doing the extra greeting is such a power move tbh
Do a couples cringe with jenna
I saw this video on my recommended and said, “Oh shit, wait.”
The weasel moaning is the *absolute* worst thing *ever*
12:12 NO WAY THIS IS REAL PLSSSGDGS
The Barbie Rapunzel pc game hit different though 😍
He should have watched the 3 musketeers or the diamond castle
I know I’ve been on this channel too long when I thought “wood chipper? I hardly know her” and Kurtis didn’t say it??
I need that extra greeting, mayor. @kurtisconner
You should do the newest movie for each ! Maybe monster high tooooo
how many kids are burred in the basement. creep.
the bratz were way creepier no thank u❤️
0:34 kurtis. 😐
Bratz is for future Niki Minaj stans
“Dillon walks so Eboys can run their fingers through their hair”
I had to keep on pausing this video because I couldn’t get air or hear what was being said from laughing so hard, I love Kurtis’ demonstrations/skits about his imagined scenarios so much
Brats are definitely superior
ya hooo da ba yo
*ad plays* *I skip it*  Kurtis: “Ok back to it”  Me:👀
i thought barbie repunzel was a fever dream and i’m seriously upset it wasnt
Hey man not cool, I subscribed for the extra greeting last week and the first video you upload after that has no extra greeting? This was the worst deal ever
I think the good pixies choose to live among humans so they have a spell to hide themselves and the evil pixies don't care so they don't hide how they look
I watched Barbie as Rapunzel when I was a kid and honestly I somehow remembered it being way better than this. Like I didnt recognise it. Oml the animation I- this looks like a horror movie lmao
bruh barbie sued 😂
7:20 nearby village
THAT PICTURE OF BALD KURTIS
i clicked on this video and the first think i thought was "i hope kurtis doesn't forget his extra greeting today." :(
I love how he chose a random Barbie movie not knowing that The Princess & The Pauper is the most popular because of Preminger and all the memes with him
I- I once made an alternative kurtis barbie princess account 🧍🧍🧍🧍
can you PLEASE do barbie mariposa that movie is TERRIFYING
There is also Fullah the arab barbie. A little tanner, a little curvier, with black hair. As a kid, I used to think that doll was ugly, it goes to show how the beauty standards of white and thin were inserted in our minds even early on in childhood.
😭😭we didnt get an extra greeting😭
Is that the community flag???
FINE I’m just gonna greet myself 🙄🙄
Ha hooo da ha yo, this video was next level unhinged are you okay?
literally laughed so fucking hard at this video.  good job kurt
Not having the extra greeting hurts me.
I'm just here for Kurtis's sneeze
I had that Bratz movie on DVD as a kid!! I loved it
Bratz Pixie movie? Best of them all. Barbie movies? All fantastic childhood faves. I didn’t care much for the dolls for either but the movies made a huge impact on me. It’s didn’t affect my views on how a girl or woman should look, I know it has for many, but I focused more on the stories being shown on screen and how each character interacted or the style of clothing they worn. I dreamt of the swan lake Odette dress from her wedding
saying that Bratz movie was better than Barbie as Rapunzel is the biggest stitch up of 2021
ya hoo da ba yo
I’m I the only one who wants Kurtis to react to Barbie fairytopia so he can see Bibble
Pog
Ok but what if the extra greeting is literally my favorite part of the video?
kurtis this isnt fair. you should have watched the best barbie movie to fairly evaluate. barbie: princess and the pauper.
I support not doing the intro
this video was so freaking funny, I can’t
21:48 I literally repeated this part so many times I’m exhausted of how much I laughed
Kurtis you betrayed me
5:35 omg hobi 💜 iykyk
The Bratz movie was literally my favorite movie as a kid. I would watch it 24/7 and pretty much knew the whole script. This swept in so many old memories haha!
STOP BECAUSE THE APOLOGY VIDEO WAS FUCKING JAMES CHARLES I AM  C R Y I N G 😂😂😂😂😂
Vrg in norteño mexican spanish has a very different meaning 🥰
EVERY ONE!!! KURTIS’ NEXT VIDEO WILL BE HIS 200TH VIDEO!!! SO IN THE NEXT VIDEO WE ARE ALL GONNA COMMENT A LINE FROM HIS OTHER VIDEOS!! FOR EXAMPLE, “MAKIN IT STINKY”!!!!
But, Rudy's got the chalk🤔
omg i used to watch that pixie movie everyday as a child
Dude…… 😔 I love the extra greeting it always makes me smile…. Sad
WHDUYEHFUYHFGDYU WHAT NO NO I CANT NOT THE EXTRA GREETING PLS SIR I AM STARVING FEED UR CITIZENS WE WANT EXTRA GREETING
Kurtis.... you — ah— stahp—— that’s my childhood
Petition for Kurtis to release his full Matrix dub, with him playing all the characters and only using sounds available in his existing libraries.
for some reason, this video made me think of this one move i would watch as a child. i thought that my mom would know, so at 2am i messaged her "do you remember that one movie where there were like these three baby triplets and they were all at the mall and there were anumals and the babies and animals exsaped and then like went around the mall being little troublemakers and the parents/babysitters were chasing them, tryinf to catch the babies and at the end they all had like a group karaoke and they win money". i did literally one google search and found it.  "Bratz Babies: The movie" has been forever imprinted in my mind.
It pains me he keeps referring to the BRATZ (the main characters of the entire franchise), "Breanna's friends" 😂
*So you mean to tell me ‘Chalkzone’ wasn’t a fever dream?......this explains a lot.*
Not watching the live action Bratz movie was a mistake. That movie is GREAT. UNIRONICALLY.
watch out he's gonna get cancelled again
kurtis should just make a video reacting to comments cause some of y'all kill me💀
i never watched bratz movies but my favorite barbie movie was the diamond castle i think og cottagecore lesbians like theres thes teo guys that they just ditch bc theyre like "omg bestie i love u" and then likd u can just tell
Its easy Barbies are for pretty princesses and bratz are for bad bitches BUT both are fucking iconic
1:45am and im on your twitch... I need to go to bed lol
as a barbie movie stan i was thinking abt barbie movies that he could've reviewed that were better but honestly, in any case, i think kurtis would have a lot of fun with bibble in barbie mermaidia.
Bruh I'm still traumatized from the Bratz Halloween movie and NOT for the reasons you would expect. Just. Just google it and ull know what I mean.
them barbie mfs look like they from the sims
why am i kind of attracted to the prince in the barbie rapunzel one what the fuck
NOT THE ARCTIC MONKEYS REFERENCE LMAO
Dude, I'd watch the Bratz movies all the time as a kid seeing the pixie one in this video was like a breath of fresh air
i’m a jerk
Give us the extra greeting Mr. Mayor, you are here to fulfil our demands, WE WANT THE EXTRA GREETING!
the MyScene erasure........
also the fact all of barbies villains are all antisemetic lmaoooo
The fact that I thought brats dolls were too ugly is literally proof of the unrealistic beauty standard...
I am ok with both but i always preferred bratz also barbie and ken are modeled after cousins so yeah couple of the year i guess
Hey! He's our mayor. He's definitely not a virgin.
Rapuuuunzel is baaald now😀
LOL yeah right the only stamps he has on his v card are mushrooms 😂😂😂 🤣🤣😈😈😈
lmao i watched a bunch of the bratz and barbie movies as a kid, and let me tell you for both of the franchises the ones you picked are pretty low tier, more so for barbie. but either way, bratz wins for sure.
I wish kurtis did Bratz Rock Angelz instead 🤣💀
Watching this high best thing I’ve seen good job I enjoyed 🙂😎
ok but why does rapunzel is bald now kinda slap
You literally chose the worst of the two franchises 😂😂
With that weird al hair you just now.. that this guy fucks!
Bruh I am lowkey mad he didn't watch the Diamond Castle or the other Barbie movies. Rapunzel is kinda one of the worst ones 🥲
I honestly want Kurtis to review more Bratz movies. Those could get utterly insane.
Oh my god, the only reason I clicked on this video was because I saw Bratz fashion pixies and I'm so glad you talked about it! I grew up loving that movie SO much and this is the first time I've seen someone talk about it! Bless
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Fun fact: my older sister and I have quoted the line "never release your prisoner with a lying heart," since this movie first came out. Yes, it's been around 20 years, but it'll NEVER get old 🤣😂
barbie rapunzel was my favorite movie as a kid. looking back that shit is weird asf
i cant stop laughing from the gnome hydrant sht omg
aight kurtis we have beef now why the hell r u sponsored by  an app not available where we live how the hell did you get the damn card if the app isnt available in canada im PUZZLED
The dance sequence editing had me geeking so hard the entire time lmao. Had no business being THAT funny
When Kurtis was making the joke abt the va being hard I got an ad for cox
Honestly, I'd love for you to not have to do that same exact greeting every single time. You've been doing it for so long, I'd say let's grow and do something new. Think we've had enough greetings to last us a lifetime lol
You have to do MY SCENE Jamin in Jamaica
Why does Kurtis look like an 80s serial killer now
omg I thought that Czech republic movie was bad but I watched these as a kid and never realized these r almost on that same level hahaha
i have the barbie movie on dvd lmaooooo
I miss the extra greeting....😔
the “dylan walked so eboys could run their fingers through their hair” was the best line in this entire vid
The antagonist's pet snake in Ella Enchanted is way too h0rny for no reason
Kurtis, you've made a horrible mistake now you have to watch and rate more barbie and bratz movies
When your forehead is identical to Kelly’s IRL
Now kurtis needs to rate Ever After High
The brats kinda looks like N64 animation
The Barbie Rapunzel movie used to be my favorite and I do NOT remember the weasel being like that oml. I also don’t remember the kids looking that creepy, but honestly old Barbie movies just smash into the uncanny valley. It’s the sacrifice we have to make for excellent storytelling 😩
bruh i totally remember that barbie movie
"Mattel me that" I choked
The 18:47 silence is what I’ve been living like since the beginning of the pandemic
only virgins don’t do the second greeting
Bratz movies were my entire childhood, kurtis you need to watch the sleepover one that one was absolute nightmare fuel it was so greag
:(
This video made me laugh so hard omfg
We are going strong with 144k Kelly holes people🤠
There are entire compilations on here of that weasel being a gotdam freak
Kurtis just some advice… Barbie mermaidia is the only acceptable Barbie movie
So glad this is anywhere on trending. This video 👍. make laughter
Personally I was a Barbie kid growing up and wasn't allowed to play with Bratz dolls because they were inappropriate. But I think both have awful animation style. Barbie is slightly better, the plot is better and Bratz kinda just went crazy
2:54 is that the greendale flag lol
it actually pains me that he chose possibly the DRIEST barbie movie to watch. like, princess and the pauper exists. mermaidia exists. diamond castle + the original cottagecore lesbains exist. #justiceforbarbiemovies
When I was about 7 (pretty recent lol) me and my cousin would tie strings around my dolls necks and put them on the road so we could watch them me crushed. I don’t know why we did this. I don’t know how we weren’t bothered by it but oh well.
Now I expect two extra greetings in the next video. Kurtis... Look at me, Kurtis...I want.. my greetings... Kurtis. Give me what I want and I'll go away...
I’m sorry but literally at 21:45 I just knew you was gonna say something about that girl😭😭😭😭                 😡/              /\\             ((🍑))                 / \
I refuse to choose
BRATZ IS SUPERIOR
tbh this is monster high erasure
I would absolutely love to see you make movies reviewing other Barbie movies 😂 that segment was very entertaining lmao.
i have ever barbie movie except the newer ones
the no extra greeting sent me into shock
flying unicorns kurtis? really. pegasus. pegaSUS
You should’ve watched barbie princess and the pauper it’s so good, I mean bratz is always the best but still it’s my fav barbie movie
I’m going to piss on you  -kurtis Conner
To finally end this debate once and for all Barbie had the better movies and bratz had the best dolls!!
this is definitely one of his best videos ive never laughed so hard
I liked Bratz dolls better but I like the Barbie movies better
i always think abt the pain of a guy climbing up the hair too lol
As a Barbie-Head, I'm offended.
Wait no second greeting?
KURTIS PLEASE WATCH THE FAIRYTALE BRATZ MOVIE!!! I BEG OF YOU
Kurtis mentioning Chalk Zone unlocked a deep memory I didn’t know I had
Hey FLORIDA MAN
Not comparable. Barbie all the way
bro plot twist the weasels voice actress is hisoka
The content I never knew I needed. You got a new subscriber  beshie 👀😜😂
I liked the do I wanna gnome joke. good video thanks
ya hooo da ba yo
Okay Barbie as Rapunzel slaps at sleepovers when you’re trying to marathon all the Barbie movies with your gal pals in the early 2000s.
ugh I knew u would have taste. every bratz movie slapped and so did the series
That made me sad Kurt I missed the extra greeting :( it's ok ig tho
I still own both of these moviesss

Got an ad for Barbie before this video and another one about dolls
Oh my goodness this its been a while since as ive laughed this fucking hard🙏 comedy gold
if annything can happen in this world... then could the creators or barbie as rapunzel make kelly look more like a child and not like a human punpkin seed?
The mayor is 22nd on trending congratulations
ya hoooo da ba yo
Your forgetting the dope ass bratz ps2 games
ya hooo da ba yo
I don't give a flying hoot about the missed extra greeting but a FOUR?? For Barbie Rapunzel??? I will click unsubscribe faster than those animators fixed human face Sonic I stg.
im proud to say ive watched fashion pixiez in the last year but i wa ssuper baked so i kept messing up cymbeline and lena (?)  😢😢
You're wild for not watching Bratz:Rock Anglez the soundtrack goes so crazy I'm not even joking its unironicly good
Film theory talked about the rapunzel hair thing you were wondering about, yes she would be bald
istg me and kurt face palmedat the exact same time after "do i wanna gnome"
disappointed you didn’t do bratz sleepover 😔
Ya hooo da ba yoo
Fashion pixies was the best Bratz movie don’t try and change my mind
Ya hoo da ba yo
that barbie movie was wedged far in the back of my mind. I forgot i ever watched it until now
You should have chose The Princess and the Pauper. The movie goes so hard
The fact that he said kelly looks like what stubbing your toe feels like is fucking SENDING ME GHAHAHAHAHAH
kurtis why the fuck am i subscribed if I'm not promised my extra greeting >:(
now kurtis has to watch a monster high movie
Who won?, neither, cause both are cringe
No extra greeting?? Ffs. Immediately unsubscribing
That Community reference at 2:52 👌
it’s not virgin, guys, it’s v3rga 😳😳
I'd love to see you do Bratz genie magic lol

Honestly, the Barbie movies growing up were definitely a source of comfort for me. Not to mention I felt like the dolls that I owned from those movies felt like friends to me! Bratz just...never appealed to me, the name alone just made them sound off-putting. I do understand why making dolls have weird body types and even sexual aspects is...fuckin' weird, to say the least. But even if the body images aren't great (it's getting better, though), the Barbie movies at least have way better messages, funny jokes, decent voice acting, and music that absolutely slaps. I think the Bratz dolls definitely win in terms of body diversity, but Barbies win in terms of appealing outfits and better films.
This video cured 96.888% of my depression
Barbie repunzel is hands down the BEST barbie movie, no I don’t take criticisms don’t @ me
I honestly didn’t know rapunzel painting or having her hair cut was a thing. I honestly thought it was made up in Disney’s tangled. ⭐️ 🌈 the more you know 🌈 ⭐️
Hi
my mom would never let me TOUCH bratz dolls and whenever we walked past the Monster High Dolls she'd cover my eyes and make me quickly walk past... no wonder i have problems
Kurtis needs to watch the Bratz baby movie, the superhero one, and the sleepover one
sending a cease and desist letter to God
Bro I was watching this in front of my mom and that btch just moaned😢
That specific bratz movie made me obsessed with skirts over jeans
Listen how down bad are you if a bratz doll turns you on… That excuse is equivalent to teachers saying shoulders are attractive 🙄💅🏾
Kelly can’t hurt you it’s ok  Kelly:                          👁         👁                    👄
So now subscribers don't even get an extra greeting?? Unsubscribe. Yikes.
i believe bratz are the superior doll and toy overall, especially at the time, but the barbie movies and shows were so damn good. barbie won me over in that regard during my childhood lmao
barbie is better u clown
There's a difference vetween being sexualized and being trendy. Facebook moms need to grow up.
no extra greeting   no like >:(
I’m not mad about no extra greeting, I’m just….disappointed
It’s okay mayor Kurtis it’s not like my happiness relied on an extra greeting 🥲
I wanna climb Kurtis’ mustache hairs so his upper lip is bald now
the fvking sound of barbie saying “balls” with that echo got me every time hhhdsds i hate it sm
by far my fav vid from u ever lmao
KAKAKAKAKAKKAKA
love this postmodernist commentary by purposefully refusing a second greeting, kurtis. im plastered
balls for viewer interaction
THIS VIDEO IS BASICALLY 8 YEAR OLD ME MEETING 20 YEAR OLD ME AND I FEEL SO COMFY HERE. I never knew a damn video would give me so much comfort. Thank u kurtis
Bruh I was extremely nervous after he announced there would be no extra greeting, like this was me:👁👄👁
Barbie princess and the pauper was my fave
Flying unicorns are called alacorns lol
for anyone who watched the rapunzel movie growing up, i hope we’re all unanimously disappointed that kurtis didn’t talk about the dress making scene :-(
holy shit i forgot about that superbass video lmaoooo
dylan is barbies ryan
do i waannnna gnome?
Literally watched that ridiculous bratz movie SO MANY TIMES when I was little and that’s the only that remember vividly. I think the only reason I liked it was because of the magic powers and the wings🤷🏽‍♀️
NOOOOO U COULDVE WATCHED BARBIE FASHION FAIRYTALE OR CHARM SCHOOL
I saw the pissing gnome part while I was burping and I laughed so hard I threw up on my bed.
bless you
bratz fashion pixies will forever be the superior movie
❤️❤️❤️
Barbie all the way no matter wat
A little hurt with the no extra greeting  virgin
Now I don't even feel NORMALLY greeted 😭
The Rapunzel is bald now thing sent me
Now monster high vs ever after high *psssss monster high > ever after high*
Where is the comparison with myScene dolls
d a m n that stache gets bushier by the second.
this gives me sooo much nostalgia omfg
Bratz is better
Kelly fucking looks like a sticky tablet kid
i never knew bratz had movie but let me tell you know, i have *alot* of barbie movies and also some monster high ones too
Man I sure do wish I got greeted twice during this video
i watched the rapunzel movie a lot as a kid and vividly remember the chase scenes and footsteps
number 11 on trending!
Make this a series <3
16:40 why the fuck did I think he was gonna say ‘transvestite’?
What keeps bothering me about Barbie's Rapunzel is that they never explain why she had hair that long...
I love Barbie Nutcracker! Edit: omg he talked about my FAVORITE BRATZ MOVIE EVERRRR!!! I have the song just let go now saved on my youtube 😍 still a bop to this DAY
Love the change up with the extra greeting. It’s nice to keep things feeling fresh. Unsubscribed.
did anyone else get an ad with a cgi lion with a robot voice asking if you believe in god or if you “choose science”?? just me??
These movie clips unlocked memories I forgot I had
Proud of you for choosing the best Bratz movie.
Your commentary had me dying
that james charles shade 18:55
I cannot sit idly by while I, as a subscriber, am getting deprived of my extra greeting. I not only want a refund, I need to speak to the manager in the most Karen way possible.
CHALK……FUCKING…….ZONE?!?!  A new memory has been unlocked
Shave it.
turdis conner
Omgg chalk zone
The shade behind “I didn’t mean it, I’m desperate” 😂
dude this one was a banger
You could’ve done princess charm school
wait i thought your name was kurtis corner for the longest time
okay but “barbied wire” is the funniest thing i’ve ever heard
BOTH OF THESE MOVIES ARE ICONIC IN MY CHILDHOOD
can we appreciate the fact i grew up with barbies my whole childhood then randomly went through a bratz doll phase 15 years after they were popular and forced my grandma to take me to goodwill to look for some bratz dolls and sets because we couldn’t find them anywhere else😭😭
Next time do Monster High
Somehow Kurtis seemed like he had a lot of fun with this one. Nice :)
kurtis looks like he shouldn’t be within a kilometer of a school
I tried buying the new merch collection but your store doesn’t ship to Alaska. Is it possible to start shipping to AK?
I- NOSTALGIA
fine kurtis i'll watch the video please stop now
The fact that I remember all of these
KURTIS I’m subscribed for a reason
I have the story book of barbie as rapunzel good memories🤣
I SUBSCRIBED FOR AN EXTRA GREETING
Dude, You just rated the Movies...Now you should rate the dolls!
i literally listen to Very Really Good and i still thought the vrg stood for virgin lmao did not connect the dots
COLLAB WITH CODY KO
I think buzzfeed or some similar youtube channel did an experiment where they pulled heavy stuff with a long wig to see if it was doable
I’ll admit “scrotum scrolls”  got me.
Should’ve watched Bratz Rock Angels
kurtis we know u dubbed the voice acting skit @6:10 bc if you didnt u would never live it down
Okay I’m not gonna MAKE you give an extra greeting, but I’d be lying if I said I’m not sad
Would love love some Kurtis x Kell sweat shorts. All the merch has been great! ❤️
disliking bc i wasnt greeted specially
damn, not getting that extra greeting pushed me over the edge ngl
KURTIS IF YOU EVER CONSIDER MAKING SOMETHING ELSE LIKE THIS THEN I WOULD SAY DESCENDENTS VS MONSTER HIGH FOR DESCENDENTS I WOULD PICK DESCENDENTS 2 VS MONSTER HIGH HAUNTED THEIR MY FAVORITES SO YEAH
Bratz bias 🖐🏻😑
Confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart Jesus died on the cross for your sins, was buried, and was raised from the dead on the 3rd day.  Please get saved before it is too late. God bless you all in Jesus name.❤
Actually! Mattel sued MGA (Bratz distributors) because the creator of Bratz, Carter Bryant, was working at Mattel when he came up the idea for the doll line and such that the creation of a separate brand infringed on their contract with him! They actually won the initial lawsuit and were awarded $100 million AND the copyright ownership to the Bratz line but the decision was reversed in 2010 by the Court of Appeals and ownership was given back to MGA! There was also a recall of all Bratz products for a time when Mattel had won the lawsuit! It was a really wild time lmao!
Lol he chose to watch my favourite childhood barbie movie
What about my scene dolls
seeing that Barbie movie again really made me question my childhood choices
aw chalk zone was my shit
Kurtis Conner looks like an 80’s Canadian dad who beats up kids at school for bullying his gay son who he accepts and loves because he is open minded
23# on trending
I used to have the biggest crush on the pixie at 24:23 as a kid lmfao
But why does Kurtis actually sound like the weezle😂
It’s so funny how Kurtis left out major details that explain why Rapunzel couldn’t just escape the tower lmao
Headwig's a girl XP
Not look like stubbing your toe feels like😂😂😂
Petition for Kurtis to cover the new Barbie show, absolute fucking gem
The fact that he chose THAT Barbie movie and THAT bratz movie kills me….. u can’t even make a good comparison
I miss my extra greeting 😢
I can’t give this video a like cause I didn’t get my 2nd intro. I was promised a 2nd intro when I subscribed 3 years ago. What the hell Kurtis?
Not gonna lie. Brats hit the hardest in how I wanted to be growing up and represented me the best. But... Barbie movies are iconic. I literally just imagined my cousin was barbie and I'd be her bud. (My cousin is half Scandinavian and has blonde hair blue eyes.)  Edit:  Also the Bratz movie he chose was literally my life for years. I watched that movie so freaking much.
Nice mustache kurtis
pls tell me someone remembers the brats fish tank game
there are barbie dogs with functioning assholes
dude please keep using that weasels moaning as a sound effect
Kurtis. I don't subscribe for nothing. I better have my extra greeting next video or else.
I refuse to believe Kurtis hates kids cuz he's full of dad jokes.
The irish accent is accurate and he even spoke some Irish, I’m impressed
nOT THE JAMES CHARLES APOLOGY VIDEO AKSJDJSSJ
blease cover more bratz movies they are so weird and iconic - i strongly suggest bratz rock angelz and maybe also forever diamondz or whatever they were on REPEAT in my house when i was like 13
Okay but can we get him to watch monster high...
I wish I could like this video twice, it's now my fav comfort video.
The urge to dislike out of the sheer anger I felt from the lack of an extra greeting. How dare you sir.
Bruh i wanna shave ur mustache so bad
petition for Kurtis to watch the other barbie movies  😭😭✊🏼
This was a good one Kurtis! Keep it up 👍
I used to love watching that bratz movie, it brought so much memories. Thank you for this video 🥰
hit the like button at the weasel moan
kurtis i really think you should watch barbie princess and the pauper. i can't let barbie remain in your mind as a 4/10
"I'm not gonna do the one thing that will easily solve all my problems until I absolutely have to" I mean that's understandable me too
Let's be real though: Barbie saying "balls" is nothing compared to the Weasel saying "Give him to me... UUuuUuUgGGgggGGhHhhHh!!!!!!!!"
WOOD-CHIPPER 💀💀
Congrats on getting your video on trending! 😄
Unsubscribing because what's the point? If I'm not getting an extra greeting what is my benefit of subscribing
Give him to me... Auuuuhhh...
Bro I started crying at 22:05 i can't
bratz movies got me through some shit when I was younger, watching it all the time when my parents argued, even when the police got called.
I think I saw you on Fatherhood (the movie) on Netflix
ya hooo da ba yo
dylan looks horrifying
I was a huge Bratz fan.
Please watch brats babies it’s the best
i know the MCU (mattel cinematic universe) is lacking here, but PLEASE checkout barbie life in the dreamhouse
I'm so surprised to hear actual Irish spoken in a non Irish movie
kurtis you literally picked the most boring barbie movie out of all of them
I was just having a conversation the other day about how I strongly preferred Bratz to Barbie when I was growing up, then this video pops up in my recommended 🤣🤣🤣
I just realized I can't find my "please be nice to me hat"  ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I almost clicked off when he chose not to do an extra greeting. (jk I absolutely love him but like still I'm offended)
This is treason....
22:49 instead you shoulda said “it’s not snow it’s blow”
The party is like a bunch of Emos at prom
i remember i wanted to be a goth pixie so bad bc of brats lmao
kurtis comparing kelley to a toe stub sent me orbiting like wtf man 💀😭😭
i can’t believe kurtis literally chose RAPUNZEL out of all the Barbie movies. disgrace.
I feel like Quentin should’ve won horniest weasel. What a snub
not Barbie getting victim blamed smhhh
REVIEW MORE BARBIE MOVIES PLZ!!!!!!!!!
WHERE IS MY EXTRA GREETING KURTIS NOW I’M DEPRESSED
AYO can we pls get a full version of repunzel is bald now on Spotify.
Wow I forgot Chalk Zone even existed until you brought it up. Oh man that brings a lot of memories back.
watch Barbie: Life in the Dream house. there's only one season on Netflix, its my little sister's favorite show therefore I've seen it like 1000 times but I've laughed real hard a lot of times.
MyScene dolls always get left out 😭 but Bratz were better hands down it’s not even a competition.
Who told this man to pick Rapunzel out of all the movies? I love all of them as every barbie stan but come on !!!
Dude if I remember correctly Bratz Genie magic was lit
B4 we even start Brats , that’s it. Bratz.
Mr. Conner, I'd like to give you the benefit of the doubt on this whole virgin thing, but you clearly move like a person whose hymen is still intact. It's a very distinct body language thing, once you know how to spot it, you never miss it.
im still bitter they changed kelly's name to chelsea
i’m sad about the greeting
i KNEWWWW the extra greeting was coming to an end. am i hurt? yes. can i blame my mayor? no i cannot
also, now you have to compare barbie vs bratz video games. get ur hands on some Bratz Forever Diamondz for ps2. I don't make the rules.
rapunzel had her hair wrapped around the column in the window so that it'd pull against that and not her scalp
kurtis u need to apologize to sighourney weavel. I mean, sighorny weaser. wait, shit
"Rapunzel is bald now"
rip current promo for canadians :(
"alright it's time for the final award of the night: horniest weasel" *cuts to martin scorsese*  i choked on my drink
Rudy’s got the chalk
petition for kurtis to watch the barbie princess and the pauper movie. hands down superior movie AND it’s got preminger 🥴
I wanted my extra greeting
kurtis needs to review the princess and the pauper. he would EAT UP premingers song i can only imagine the meme potential
The Bratz community is insane right now! 😂
btw lina is apparently in her 30s and just disguised as a high schooler
Oh my god it’s fucking Kelly
bless you!
btw lina is apparently in her 30s disguised as a highly school SMH
My Scene VS Winx!!!!
I have all the Barbie movies on DVD
i would do ANYTHJJ NG to look like lina
I've been a citizen of kurtis town for quite awhile but I have NEVER read the comments (i know..crazy 🤯) but the comments section is hilarious im crying 😂😂
no cause i LOVED that bratz movie when i was younger and this brought back so many memories lmao
You should do a video on the kids show Boobah
This was amazing!! Great video so funny
Y’all remember MyScene? 👀
I NEED MORE BARBIE REVIEWS YEE YEE
I was guy back then (I'm transgender ) so when I ever liked dolls or girly things they made fun of me I tried act tuff and boyish but it wasn't me  I got really bad bullying and I'm teen and I still like dolls I collocat them and they still bully me but again I don't give f now
he would look so much better if he shaved his mustache
I actually loved bratz way more than barbies because there was a bratz doll that resembled me, as a child that was so cool and exciting but then monster high dolls came out and that was my ultimate favorite lol
Shave your head, though
Kurtis Connor, I have felt VERY hurt for not giving me my very well DESERVED extra greeting. I feel very poor and now I’m making a hate comment on why you have not. I am truly DISAPPOINTED and want one now 😡😡😡😡.
I knew he was gonna stop doing the extra greeting because he just doesn't like it anymore. I feel like the first time he "forgot" it he was actually hoping people wouldn't notice so he could phase it out. It feels like he hasn't liked it for quite some time now so I really think we should just let it go
I liked Bratz better
If Danny and drew had a baby- When Danny and drew have a baby this will be the child He’s a mix
kurt, kindly, what the fuck. wheres my greeting ? u cant do us like this smh
...I've been gone for a bit... Why does he have a squirrel on his lip?
ya hooo da ba yo
If my dude had watched Barbie's the Princess and the Pauper there would be no competition
I can't tell if Curtis is about to join NASCAR or start his wrestling career with that glorious mullet
Oh damn, we are entering the era of no extra greetings anymore
can we talk about how Kurtis is blushing at 11:01
Kurtis is the cool older brother we all deserve 😭😭💖💖
Please kurtis I beg of you, do the fairytopia movies
Should’ve watched Barbie Swan Lake — absolute BANGER
Its not funny to make fun of Kelly because of her Receding hairline. It's A serious issue
#KirtisIsOverParty you robbed me of an extra greeting during PRIDE MONTH. I can’t believe this. Biggest scandal of 2021 right here 🙄🤧
Ball scroll i died
The no extra greeting is unacceptable. I'm subscribing now. You just ruined my life smh
“I didn’t mean it I’m desperate”  OMG NOT KURTIS MOCKING JAMES’S  “apology video” 😭
This was way too funny
ive since watched all the barbie movies but I only had bratz dolls growing up because my family was poor 😀
i had no idea that i’ve actually been waiting my whole life for this
Omg ! U unlocked a memory
every second of this video is god tier
bro barbie and the 12 dancing princesses is such a better movie the  Rumpelstiltskin
Maybe the garden gnomes have a p!ss kink
Rly hitting that lesbian demographic lmao
happy pride king. i know ur straight but im personally okay including you in our community. We have a bunch of letters, what's one more K, yanno? LGBTQIAK
Virgin Rage Goddammit
kurtis conner rebel arc??
i. love. you!!!!
No extra greeting? :((
can't believe you referred to cloe, sasha, yasmin, and jade as "brianna's friends" smh show some respect
Our mayor picked the wrong Barbie movie to review though…
My mom never let me have a Bratz doll. I can’t really remember why. She said they were inappropriate😔🤦🏼‍♀️
What about...   Alternative...   Monster high
Why did this come across my feed? What is this? This guy needs to get drafted . . . Gaf.
WAIT I just thought of something Wings club Wings club🤯🤯🤯 Coming soon....
My name is Kelly but THANKFULLY I'm not a blonde with a huge ass forehead :^)
im sad wheres my extra greting :(
Why did I think these movies looked so good when I was a kid...
Let’s end this once and forever   Team Barbie comment with 🤍 Team Bratz comment with 🖤
Pretty sure in tangled she used a pulley system which eased a lot of the weight
WHERE IS THE EXTRA GREETING
if you like dylan's twerking do yourself a favour and look up bratz out of context NOW
It’s stands for virgin don’t be fooled guys
Great video
Why does the gnomes eyebrows look like french fries
Now we need a polly pocket vs. myScene movie matchup
ITS 00:07AM!! These sound effects are killing me😂😭 but everyone’s asleep and I’m trying not to wake them up bahahaha😭🖐
IM UNSUBBED BECAUSE NO EXTRA GREETING
“Give it to me     𝑈𝑛𝙜𝙝ꫝꫝ~ 😏😫🥵“
I really didn't expect fashion pixies loool
Gnomes, cockroaches, and rapiest are hands down the worst things on earth
Ok, but Barbie and the Diamond Castle will always have the best original songs of any animated movie ever. Seriously, “Two Voices, One Song” and “Connected” are fantastic to this day
6:12 the otters name is otto and he is an icon and my favourite when I was younger
Current is not available in my county don't you live in Canada bruh
that’s not fair because you didn’t watch Barbie in the Princess and the Pauper, aka the greatest film of all time
I. Feel. Attacked. How dare I not get my extra greeting! This is a hate crime I’m unsubscribing
wAit , wasn’t the point of the dragon in the Barbie movie is that she was too nervous to actually fly high?? Am I ,, remembering that right ?
if anyone prefers barbie over bratz shut up ur wrong
Scrotum scrolls
he literally chose one of the WORSTS barbie movie to review
Ya hooo da ba yo       🙂
ya hooo da ba yo
it’s cute how the irish gnome uses the irish word for girls ‘cailíní’; cute attention to detail and all dat
Once I had a guy over for the night and instead of like cuddling and chilling or whatever he made us watch Barbie on Netflix the whole time. He did not get any that night and after he left he stopped talking to me, he also told his friend he thought he would hook up with me????
He should have picked PRINCESS AND THE PAUPER! That one is top tier, I’d even say the best Barbie movie tbh   Preminger is an icon, the voice actor really did well with the expression sounds
barbie movies were the superior movies, bratz were the better dolls, but myscene were the absolute superior dolls
you're starting a tough fight Kurt....
bless you
2:19 Barbie’s proportions would be properly scaled to a supermodel… you know like what her first job was. She was based off a real model.
IF I DON’T GET AN EXTRA GREETING THEN WHY AM I SUBSCRIBED?? 😭😭
the merch is expensive sir
This new thing came out that’s called rainbow high (it’s some dolls) and they have an animated series
Disliking because of the lack of extra greeting
she obviously anchors her hair to something else efore letting him climb? iknew that when i was 8
This reminded me of Barbie in the Nutcracker
I’m wasn’t allowed to play with bratz because they wore “too much” makeup.
Monster high was definitely the best.
if u don't watch barbie in the princess and the pauper u've already failed
The fact that I'm watching this in front of a Bratz Fashion Pixies poster 💀 Sitting through that pixie rave as a kid felt like I was watching adult swim... which explains a lot now
Dylan: - Awn they kidnapped my friends... *sad twerking*
can someone make 21:26 a meme please thank u
i watched barbie as rapunzel religiously and still even have my cd of it in pristine condition, but like bratz dolls were so much cooler
Y’all remember My Scene or is it just me 🤔
#kurtisconnorisoverparty
Petition for Kurtis to watch Barbie's Prince and the Pauper and Barbie Fairytopia! So much comedic potential there :)
annoyed that kurtis went through this whole video calling the bratz “bryannas friends.” put some respect on chloe, yasmin, sasha, and jade.
PLS- THE AMOUNT OF TIMES I STOPPED THE VIDEO BECAUSE I WAS LAUGHING SO HARD-
You need to watch princess and the pauper
Kurtis doesn’t care about the citizens of kurtistown anymore
not me watching this hoping Bratz wins 😲
bratz are way better than barbie in my opinion. they’re more diverse  cleo- white (modeled after Britney spears i believe) yasmin- hispanic (modeled after jlo) Sasha- black (modeled after Beyoncé) jade- asian (modeled after i forgot lol) i felt more included growing up with bratz than i did barbie. me being a poc it was hard to find representation back in the early 2000s that’s why i liked bratz and winx club cause you saw those different people. plus they were girly while also being badass
Why is nobody talking about  "Doth thou carpets match thy drapes"
Are you alright, you’re not being held hostage right?? Our mayor would never- I don’t even want to speak of this abomination…
Oooookay buddy I know you're not about to come for my girl Barbie rn. Her movies are iconic sir
I used to have a fear of Bratz doll. Mostly due to the size of their heads 😩
bless you kurtis
I thought the VRG in the background stood for viagra, guess I was wrong😩
not to be mean because you didnt give us the extra greeting but that weasel strangely looks like you Kurtis
The trite brazil sicily detect because slash yearly paddle toward a smart rutabaga. plastic, slimy karen
Monster High was better than both Bratz and Barbie
2:32
I loved both Bratz and Barbies as a kid. However, the current me appreciates the aesthetic, diversity and fashion styles of Bratz far more.  Also, to me, Barbie is too much of a Mary Sue type character... as a kid I didn't care but after reminiscing, it's far too bland for my taste.
you should totally watch Barbie Swan Lake
BARBIE
Grown man with a mustache discusses the merits of two franchise movies targeted at prepubescent girls.  Only YouTube. 😜🤘🏿
Omfg this is the funniest video I’ve seen in forever
At summer camp when I was younger we couldn't have lunch bags outside of a backback because crows kept taking them
movies i was not aloud to watch when i was little. ahhh so nostalgic
Bless you
I was built different. I played with liv dolls
I loved barbies but I loved bratz even more (still love both tbh). My room was even entirely bratz themed at one point, like to the extent that the walls were painted to compliment my bratz bedding on my bunk bed. Ah, the good ol' days. I still have all of my bratz, including these mini ones that they came out with and a cool ass foldable set of walls that you unfold to make a mini home for them and it has WORKING ELECTRICITY that you can plug mini lights into.  Also, the Bratz movie had this one song called Rainy Day that I'm just now remembering, and that is a song that I could still enjoy to this day.
You should’ve watched a better Barbie movie, man lol. And her name is CHELSEA not Kelly 🥺💔
Quentin Tarantino has been officially robbed from the "horniest weasel" oscar by that goddamn weasel. I mean, the man LOVES feet and his movies are a perfect reflection of his kinks!
Bruh you shouldve watched the dolphine one or mermaid one
I’m high key mad!!!!! Barbie movie superiority
Barbie will always be better.
I’ll give it to bratz for having more unique and stylish dolls but the Barbie cinematic universe simply cannot be touched.
pls more movie review ol kurt boyo
barbie is better
i fucking love this
I loved both brazt and Barbie movies and show but doll wise I liked brazts better
bratz for the win👏🏾
The wonderful thing is I was named after a barbie movie >:') My name is Genevieve. After the Genevieve and the 12 dancing princesses movie.
6:35
Didn't the horniest weasle award go to Shane Dawson?
Wait—WHY does bald Kurtis have a goatee? And WHY is it GREY?!? 😱
ya hooo da ba yo
that otter is an inside joke between me and my girlfriend so i’m glad this exists
logan paul has a podcast so.. virgins can have podcasts lmao
I wasn’t the biggest fan of Bratz as a kid, but I always really fucking hated Barbies for some reason so I am very happy that Bratz won 8) Also Monster High dolls/movies/the mini series or whatever it was was my whole childhood basically so hello to you if you are a fellow Monster High enjoyer aswell
BRATZ FASHION PIXIEZ WAS SUCH AN UNLOCKED MEMORY ISTG???? I'M CRYING
If you ever feel like doing a part 2 of this video, please watch Barbie's Princess and the pauper and Bratz Rock Angelz, I promise you won't be disappointed
Ummm AcTuALLy... it's not a FLYING UNICORN Kurtis  It's either considered a winged unicorn, pegacorn or an Alicorn, as stated in the "my little pony friendship is magic" universe   Get your facts together man 😤😂   (PSA, I'm not actually judging him I'm just a 21 y,o with too much knowledge of fantasy creatures 😂)
this is genuinely hilarious
i NEED  a review of the *live action* bratz movie. the spaghetti moment is *chef’s kiss*
That Barbie movie felt like they mixed several stories all into one, Cinderella, Tangled, Maleficent... But the weasel thing and the angry twerking made me laugh way too hard XD
Those barbie graphics scare me and make me almost hyperventilate
Barbie Princess and The Pauper was way better than Rapunzel
My mum had to ban me from watching the bratz movie when I was younger  because I got attitude from watching it 😭
Oh man ive seen all these movies as a kid wvegeghehr some of the bratz ones were so fucking terrifying
Are you John Oates son?
Oh, fish in the mouth
bratz.
I think Barbie movies are better than bratz but as far as inclusion and option for dolls I think bratz hit the mark with fashion too. But I played with both as a kid (and Liv dolls and a few other types lol) however KURT you picked one of the worst Barbie movies. Based on a story that isn’t Barbie. You couldn’t have picked any of the fairytopia or mermaidia ones!! Like cmon dude 😩😩😩 those are the notable ones
i almost pooped my pants because i was laughing a lot
Oh god that fucking weasel jesus christ
i’m so glad someone finally expressed how i feel about Kelly being freaky looking
*experiences withdrawal symptoms from not getting the extra greeting*
10:00 IM CHOKING ON WEED FROM HOW HARD I LAUGHED AT THIS DURING A HIT , holy shit im fucking dying , oh i see jesus
The mustache has to go.
should’ve send the Bratz Cinderella version..it’s so funny especially the step mom and the step sisters..they really think they’re the best out there..the step sisters are literally useless and untalented..I kind felt bad for them they have such a bad mother..but it’s still funny tho😭
the community reference. I applaud you for that
18:58 The James Charles video, I can't 🤣😭💀
WHY WOULD YOU WATCH RAPUNZEL AND NOT PRINCESS AND THE PAUPER OR TWELVE DANCING PRINCESSES
why are all the mean pixies goth  well like i assume theyre the antagonists yk but still
10:42 GREW UP WITH THAT
I’m this specific case it wouldn’t hurt to climb up the hair bc she tied it around a pole first, and that basically makes a break where the weights at. Like if you were to climb up a rope, the part at the top after the knot isn’t pulled tight ya know?
Me who only grew up with monster high: ✨
Bruh i just found gold holy shit , im so hungover and i was laughing so much i thought i was gonna die and then throw up in that specific order of course
only reason he picked rapunzel movie is because the moaning weasel😍😍😍😍 give him to me
I liked Bratz more than Barbie and begged my mom to give me Bratz dolls whenever she could
ya hooo da ba yo
curtis coKe jokes >
Before he really gets into it I gotta say I’m a Bratz girl all the way. I wear a Bratz mask to block out covid and the haters.
mayor man, thank you. mentally i’m not doing too well and you playing Barbie Rapunzel had brought a genuine smile to my face! it was my absolute favourite movie as a child
I'm a trans man. On my 7th birthday, my godfather gave me 5 Barbie movies. I wanted Bakugans and Hot Wheels 😂. Ngl tho, those Barbie movies were da bomb.
he didn't do the extra greeting the absolute madlad
Kurtis needs to start making fun of all of these movies
pls put a flash warning for 20:45 till 20:50
Okay but can we agree that Barbie was the OG and the more iconic of the two and the more visually pleasing. The Bratz dolls straight up scared me as a child with their huge eyes and heads lmao. Plus now they have included more diverse ethnicities to Barbie.
Bratz will always win bro. I religiously played the Bratz games over and over again on my PS2 lol and the movies slapped and you can't change my mind
7:52 Speaking of unrealistic beauty standards...  his hands go around her 6 inch waist no problem...
Your hate for Kelly kills me 🤣 also still love u without the extra greeting 💗
I haven’t watched you in a while and the girl tweaking and you recreating that has me in tears bruv
ya hooo da bo yo
i just picture Cardi B and Bratz dolls do a collab and the bratz and Cardi like do the wap dance and the bratz dolls do like the "æãhē" thing👩‍🦽👩‍🦽👩‍🦽👩‍🦽
bruh fashion pixiez was my fave as a kid i evolved my whole personality and being on that thing
This might be your best work yet
monster high
epic video!
Okay but we don't pit women against each other Kurtis these bitches were ALL my childhood idols and I got 90% of my personality from them lmao (+Monster High ofc)
I love this video, but I do think that “sexualizing dolls is weird” and “giving young girls unrealistic and idealized bodies to look up to inevitably creates a culture that hyper-sexualizes young girls” are statements that can and should coexist. Also, it is worth thinking about how Bratz is considered more sexual when its primary demographic is young POC. How we market to & think about young people matters.
Dylan from the Bratz was a meme for the hispanic community because he said "brutal" (like cool/awesome/rad) lmao
Chalk Zone was cool.
kinda sad we didn't get that extra greeting tho
should've watched sleepover adventure. super scary!!!
i accidentally scrolled forward and i went all the way back just for the extra greeting. my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined. might have to unsubscribe 😔✌️ /hj
why the old barbie movies look like they were made in sims 3
I have to say, I love how your brain thinks❣️💯🇿🇼 #HornyWeaselForLife
StephAAAn pls
my favorite barbie movie has always been and will always be Barbie Mariposa and her Butterfly Fairy Friends. still has the storytelling aspect but doesn't star barbie and instead of Kelly, there is an even more terrifying Bibble
give him to me~ AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAa
Also, Barbie and the nutcracker was my childhood favorite 🤩
Curtis you Buffoon. Hair is absolutely strong enough to hold a person and causes no pain as long as you’re using something besides your neck to anchor it my guy. Like Disney’s Rapunzel, she’s got the hook. And even here it’s wrapped around the pillar to help him. Hope this helps.
the arctic monkeys "do I wanna gnome" joke made me legitimately laugh out loud
You should have watched the ones that were released in the same year
this bratz film WAS MY FAVVV
Make a rapunzel is bald now song plEASE bc that’s such a bop
Excuse me, Polly Pocket was a thing and I demand it be recognised for the dying brand it is!
Coooool🤘😍🤘🤩🤘🤩💯💯💯💯💯💯
Nah you have to talk about myscene movies lol those were superior
The bit of beard growing over your top lip is making me weirdly uncomfortable. Very enjoyable video tho
Don’t be a coward, watch Monster High
Glad that Bratz won
That gnome scared the shit out me as a kid
Oh damn. I didn't know Spyro was in the Barbie Rapunzel movie. 🤔
kurtistown and stylesville being the two ballsiest places on earth
happy fathers day
Why does Kelly look like JoJo Siwa?
bro that merch 😩
The Island Princess Barbie movie kinda slaps tho
Hey, this is such a scam. Where is my extra greeting? I subscribed for it!
"im not gonna do the one thing that'll solve all my problems until i absolutely have to" oh so gothel has ADHD
ya hooo da ba yo
✨Allow me mistress.. ughhhhhhhh✨
as a femme lesbian, both have shaped my childhood and adulthood and i am forever grateful to barbie and all the bratz queenz
I don't remember the animation being this bad I thought this movie had top tier animation that put other barbie movies to shame(especially in the intro)
I could not tell you WHY kurtis made this video but god do i hope his style of topic continues
BALLS, dude
He didn't start the video normally and now I just feel empty:'l
Ok but what about mf monster high 😳
I never played that much with dolls, so idk which brand i would have picked at the time, but as of now, i 100% prefer barbie. Mostly because of the diversity and HOLY SHIT barbie life in the dreamhouse was hilarious, top tier comedy
25:08 ARE WE NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT THE MOVES OF THAT CROW 😭😭😭
Kurtis. Why the fuck would you do a review of Barbie and not choose fairytopia or mermaidia as it’s representative film. I DEMAND a rematch
19:50 I can't believe their mom is Billie Eilish
Damnit I’m literally only subscribed for the extra greeting
I really love you Kurt's, but  this was so disrespectful . DIDN'T WE JUST WATCHED THE SAME HORRENDOUS ANIMATION AND PLOT.  That kinda hurted my soul and offended me like my uncles on Christmas, not gonna lie💔😂
why does Kelly look like she’s the main antagonist in a horror movie, she’s like Annabelle but so so much worse
No greetings? I'm hurt.
Funny how all these movies have shitty animation
Bald Kurtis is a thing of nightmares
Kurtis i have so much gender envy for you
THE VIDEO I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR
Dude the fucking “Bratz Kidz: Sleep Over adventure” t r a u m a t i z e d me, It was a fever dream in the worst way possible
absolutely WAS NOT expecting the greendale community college flag emblem to show up in this video
The other day I was looking at old bratz doll lines for nostalgia and in every photo gallery for each doll line was a random photo of a animated gnome. I guess it was from this movie, cause I have no other idea what it’d be from, but also why
Chalk Zone reference on point 👌🏼 I didn’t think I’d see this in 2021
i like monster high better im sorry
Can you shave the mustache please it’s getting too long. Thank you
WHAT ABOUT MY SCENE DOLLS?!
thx for the video Kurits
Bratz soundtracks will always remain a constant force in my head
I think this is the hardest I’ve laughed in a while. My family was genuinely concerned.
I don't think I've ever seen your videos before but you are hilarious 😂
Wow I had no idea u had a podcast, Kurtis. Can’t wait to binge ery eally ood!
12:20 that kid reminds me of that one crazy kid at the park in that one anime high school game
Kurtis finally having the gumption to speak his truth and stop doing the extra greeting is a great progression in his character arc
Barbie has a more successful  YouTube channel than I ever will, I hate it here😂
I love bratz and bratz movies so much so so much  I'm also very happy that bratz won <3
15:53  "Brutal"
4:12 "assing me"
I know it’s not realistic but I would die for another one of these w two diff movies. This was so funny.
yknow, it doesn't hurt rapunzel when the prince climbs up her hair because she holds the hair so it's not pulled right from the roots
you should’ve picked barbie island princess it is one of the best
My mom didn’t let me play with brats cause she didn’t want me to “be a whore”… epic fail
0:25 how many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man  #kurtisconnerisover
I'm telling you, the movie Thankskilling is one of the best uses of time out there
Kurtis be now on doll youtube community
NAURRR but we all know monster high was THE superior 😪
"How does she fart?"  Kurtis out here asking the real questions
Idc what anybody says Bratz is sooooo much better than Barbie they were iconic also bless you kurtis
Kurtis x weasle fic coming out soon on my watpad
@8:27 🏃‍♂️ 😂😭
to be fair I was more of a Polly Pocket and LPS kid anyways
Anyone else think Kurtis should react to Steve Terreberry videos?
The pegasus and swan barbie movies were my favorite. I had the Barbie game on the computer
why is the mom in the bratz movie kinda…
I love how when Barbie says "Balls" it literally radiates in the video for a good 5 seconds
I actually thought the letters meant Virgo 😌
awsome vid keep up the good work
THE BARBIE MOVIE MUSIC IS JUST TOO GOOD FOR YOU TO HAVE COMPLETELY LEFT OUT. Especially the rapunzle soundtrack??? The Barbie movie slander in this video is just heinous.
My mom didn't let me have Bratz cuz they were "too sexual" and looking back I would dress Barbie just about the same sooooo 🤷🏼‍♀️
the way you chose not to watch barbie princess and the pauper which is not only the best barbie movie but the greatest movie of all time, is simply beyond me.
so the fairy glasses are just a metaphore for drugs?
"dost thou carpet match thy drapes??" IM DEAD.
I have that bratz movie and it was my favorite movie... I was 15 and im 25 now 😂
Wow this opened up memories I didn't know I had
That James Charles jab tho.
i demand a redo with different barbie and bratz movies
Muuuustaaaaacheeee
pls do another review of my scene: masquerade madness
Hey I'm not sure if this is just on my end, but I don't have the option for cc’s, it would be super nice to have them thoough
The damn weasel I can’t 🤣🤣🤣😭😭  I bet that voice actor regrets it so bad 💀
shoulda added the weasel from neds declassified
Little does kurtis know there were barbies that peed
8:58 lol when *she* asks for head. Hedwig was a lady-owl 😊
The “I am not what I create” transition one single minute into the podcast was so fucking funny to me, already an S tier vid
THE SUBTLE JAMES CHARLES DISS IS WHAT KEEPS ME GOING EVERYDAY LMAOOO
during the outdo my brain started to hear danny’s outro music
my parents wouldn’t let me play with bratz dolls bc they didn’t want me to turn into a slut which is the stupidest shit ive ever heard
I really want to dislike this video to make a statement to Kurtis about not providing us with the extra greeting we need in order to breathe but this video is so damn good. Damn you Curtees.
as a poc woman my mom would never let me have bratz dolls or watch the movies :(
no he missed all the height cause he didnt watch barbie princess charm school
BRO ITS THE EDITING FOR ME HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH ITS EVERYTHING FOR ME I LOVE THIS
ok back to the gnome fire hydrant thing. if they piss to put out fires, does that mean that water is just gnome piss?? 🤤😀😮‍💨
BRO THIS WHOLE EPISODE WAS A POWER MOVE I LITERALLY LOST IT. I LAUGHED SO FKNHARD MAN😂😂😂😂😂😂
Do i wanna Gnome😂😂😂😂😂😂 Made my day!
✨🎶rapunzel is bald now🎶✨ will be forever stuck in my head
Barbie movies are far superior. Barbie in the nutcracker is my favorite. also barbie and the twelve dancing princesses
KEL LAUREN NATION RISE WE LOVE THEM !!! THE MERCH LOOKS GREAT :)
A 29 minute video about Bratz and Barbie? Hell yeah! That’s what I was waiting for
PLS THE DO I WANNA GNOME PART
This vs is unnecessary. Barbie wins automatically.
abt the rapunzel thing the concept of climbing someone's HAIR is just weird dude
Those who said Barbie is better should become meat shields for when aliens invade earth because aliens wouldn't shoot barbie fans since I like barbie, so aliens would also like barbie  ^_________^
Dude you've gotta watch Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper, it'll change your mind, I promise
Not me only playing with monster high dolls
“Doth thy carpets match thy drapes?”
What's above it lips...😧
✨balls✨
Scrotum scroll, lol!
I just KNOW if Kurtis chose Princess and the Pauper then there wouldn’t be any argument as to which movie is better
FOR THE UPCOMING STORM: https://i.postimg.cc/2CqGJHvT/MAP.png
congrats on trending ig lol
Even with Kurtis explaining the bratz movie, I had no idea what was going on
Bratz dolls are better than barbie dolls but barbie movies are better I think
Penelope is afraid of heights! She has to get over it in order to take rapunzel to the ball!! This made me so frustrated that he didn't catch that detail. haha
Love the way you edited this shit, it’s funny asf 😂
My mom said you look like a country perv…. I’m really sorry
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3oP1YOfhHFb4yb9YlXWPgw
I always preferred Bratz until monster high came out
Bratz will always be better then Barbie
Me and my friends all liked bratz and our parents preferred them because they had black dolls in the main line! I would play as the Yasmin doll because she matched my complexion AND HAD MY SAME MOLE 🥺🥺🥺, and my sister would play as the Sasha doll because she was a pretty dark skin girl!!! We’d imagine our adventures as teenagers and play with them. I miss them, my mum gave all my dolls away to younger relatives 🥲
I haven’t watched yet but if you say Barbie isn’t the best I am shrinking Kurtis Town down to Barbie size 😠
Omg Lena sounds like the mean girl from the Barbie diary movie lmao
He should’ve watch Bratz babies! Those are the real good ones! 😄
thumb down for no etra greeting
Ya hooo da ba yo
MATTEL ME THAT lmaooo
That bratz movie is one of my favorites its so bad it hurts but its amazing
21:58 is it just me or do they look alike
Bratz will always be superior to Barbie…. you should have done barbies princess and the pauper and Bratz fashion diamonds
Dude have you ever seen Tony Hawk Boom Boom Sabatoge? It has the same energy as the Bratz film lol https://youtu.be/mU7JmEzwbss
Finally answering the important questions
Monster High is where it's at
that barbie movie is such shitty quality holy shit i remember it as being a fucking masterpiece
Sihourny weazer
scrolltums
Ya hooo da ba ho
petition for kurtis to watch a monster high movie and barbie mermadia or magic of the pegasus
Barbie looks f****** weird too man 2:41
Doth thy carpets match thy drapes?
listen, OLD barbie movies > bratz movies barbie dolls < bratz dolls
The absurd tongue methodically fade because cover exclusively frame abaft a depressed vessel. cagey, absorbed warm
nooo my extra greeting
when i was little i had this little animatronic penelope toy that would talk. one day when i was alone in my room, she must’ve been running out of batteries or something because she said “you’ll diiiieeee” in a scary demonic voice. it still kinda gives me chills to this day when i think about it
my mom refused to buy me Barbie dolls as a kid because the Mattel company lacked diversity and she wanted me to have toys that looked like me. so when Bratz came out she bought me every single one of them because they were diverse, I loved them cause the outfits went CRAZY and I wanted to dress like a Bratz 🤣
Bratz is for girls
Bratz are what got me into fashion I remember when I got the runway for Christmas and put on my own fashion show.
Barbie is for girls
Bratz fashion pixie superior movie LMFAO
my extra greeting:(
kurtis
I want my extra greeting :(
The fact he chose rapunzel rather than one of the classics like diamond castle, or princess and the pauper, or over one of the more recent ones like princess charm school, is a travesty. Rapunzel is on the level of like, swan princess, where looking at them is a crime in itself
Therapist: "Bald Kurtis doesn't exist he can't hurt you." Bald Kurtis: 10:15
Mullet? Barbie? Bratz? Okay 💀
PLEASE POST BARBIE SAYING BALLS WITH REVERB BY ITSELF
Skyrim: The Scrotum Scrolls
18:42 why did  I laugh so hard I started crying x,D
ha hooo da ba yo
it should've been barbie vs winx
More bratz reaction videos would be hilariousss<3
I'm not like other girls, I played with monster high dolls
That bratz movie was actually my  e n t i r e  life.
this video made me subscribe. i just had to
I used to call Bratz, Hooker Barbies. I guess I still do. 😂
I looked up Kurtic Conner and it was autocorrect to Kurtis Poggers
Ok but what about My Scene dolls
The only time I played with Barbies as a child, my friend and I played serial killer murder mystery in her Barbie dream house.
Man this video really unlocked so many memories damn lol
Some girl brought a Bratz doll into school and at recess I watched her play with them and she changed her shoes and they. Had. No. FEET. It was then that I never got a Bratz doll. Even though I thought they were gorgeous, I still was so freaked out by the lack of feet.
The old Barbie movies are honestly iconic
The fact that you DIDN’T choose bratz genie magic is a personal attack
Dylan literally looks like jyp 😭
Weasel bouta make me Act up
I would give anything to watch Kurtis review my favorite movie of all time; Bratz Super Babyz😫
dislike no exta greeting # mad
bro the bratz fits go HARD
I once read that Barbie's throat is so slim that she would have to choose between eating and breathing because there just isn't enough space for everything
Ahaha that scene is so cringy where he chases her 🙈in barbie
HEY WHERES THE EXTRA GREETIGB
Ayeee trending babyyyyyyyy
I’m just sad kurtis didn’t react to bibble
Chalk zone was a gem of a show
jsut wanna say ur my new fav youtuber <3
DOTH THOUGH CARPET MATCH THY DRAPES
kurtis should have picked a better barbie movie like princess charm school, its acc really good.
NO THE EXTRA GREETING ALWAYS MADE MY DAY
Okay but I kinda wish he would’ve watched one of the barbie mermaid movies because those were fucking wild
Outside of 'Barbie as Repunzel,' 'Barbie and the Three Musketeers' was an  absolute BANGER of a film
"Do i wanna gnome" killed me
I am unsubscribing,  was only here for that extra greeting
Now we KNEW bratz was gone win
I’m scrollin through my YT, and I see this video (which I already watched, and loved) and it’s got over 1M views!!! It makes me happy that many people are consuming your content. It’s always thoughtful, intelligent, and effing hilarious. 💕
no extra greeting :(
3:05 me trying to see in the dark
10:06 BRUH--
I'm not going to judge too hard, because Kurtis obviously didn't know any better...that being said... WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING?!?!?!? Everyone know Barbie as The Princess and the Pauper is the BEST Barbie movie of all time. If you're going to try to judge fairly, you have to give everyone a fighting chance!!!
Im gonna make a horror game outta this. the graphics wont be too hard to copy with my broken computer
Shave it.
BRATZ KIDS SLEEP OVER ADVENTURE it got banned because its to scary pretty trippy stuff
okay but if you’re reacting to barbie movies it’s gotta be The Princess and the Pauper!!! barbie peaked there ngl
The Rapunzel one was one of my childhood movies so I'm excited about this
unsubscribed. leaving. my mom's calling your mom. how dare you.
barbie princess and the pauper is the best barbie movie. bratz rock angels is the best bratz movie. i don't take criticism
how dare you! barbie movies are superior! #barbiehead
There's a lot of really in-depth analysis of the history and role of barbies and bratz, their differing audiences and why barbie continues to succeed even with the rise of monster high dolls and other more articulated styalised dolls if this is a thing anyone's interested in. the movies as well in terms of straight to VHS writing is how fast and cheaply they were produced and why they often fall into nonsense fairly easy is another interest rabbit hole of kids entertainment. but i WILL recommend, if anyone wants to watch Barbie movies, the 2D animated ones ESPECIALLY "Barbie and the Rock Stars" - amazing visuals, good animation, music slaps.
the twerking part fucking killed me i couldnt stop laughing for ten minutes, every time i pressed play i would burst into laughter again.
The james charels jab had me GOING
There is a void in this video at the beginning 😖
Bratz all the way
I LOVE all of the Bratz movies so much!  Even tho I nearly pissed myself when I watched the Halloween 'sleep-over adventure' one for the first time 😀
kurtis that is my favourite bratz movie. i love it endlessly.
You fool, the true winner is and always will be monster high.
#CURTISCONNORISOVERPARTY
That Mustache bout to make me act up
Did you seriously implied made people insecure about  their bodies? LMAO
This guy really has to deviate from topic to another every ten seconds, yeah? Subscribed.
(me, irish watching the gnome chasing scene): *flashbacks to getting scolded by my irish speaking grandad as a child*
ya hooo da ba yo
First off Polly pockets were the jam. Secondly, parents cared about the clothes and make up the bratz we’re wearing. They were definitely not appropriate clothes and make up for little girls (shirt skirts, crop tops, heavy eye make up).
Holy shit when u mentioned chalk zone it accessed my long forgotten memories lmfao
TESTISCROLLS 😂🤣🤣
Not kurtis destroying my childhood 🥺
Is it anywhere near relevant to point out that the actual Rapunzel story is NOT like that?
give him to me aeugh
IVE WHEEZED LIKE 20 TIMES
ok barbie life in the dream house is a good show. don’t ask me how, idk, it’s good tho.
Don’t watch this while eating. It’s too funny
Bratz always felt so teenager and cool to my little brain.
Oh my gosh !! Why do I remember these movies to be in a waaayy better animation 🤣🤣 rewatching this scares me 😂
Bratz were the only competition to barbies? What about polly in my pockets? Or american girl dolls? Or liv dolls? Or monster high and ever after high dolls? I really liked the plastic people as a kid ok
Taylor Swift can be Barbie w talent style and a bent.
Actually laughed - many times - thank you
25:05
I used to watch that Barbie movie so much and I remember my mom hated that weasel. Now, I understand why.
I loved barbie princess charm school top tier movie!!!!!!!!!!!!
I was OBSESSED with that Barbie movie
Ok but we all know that we want kurtis to do all of the movies right? Just as a series?
22:20
No extra greeting? 🤨 Unsubscribed 🙄
Yeaaaahhh no more extra greeting wahoo!
He literally pick 2 of my favorite childhood movies
This is so weird. I only owned one of the Barbie and Bratz movies as a child and they were these two. The stars are aligning
You should’ve have reviewed Barbie’s Princess and the Pauper and the Bratz Rock Angels. Those are the best lol. (Plus Kelly isn’t in the Princess and the Pauper)
Did you mean for "Rapunzel is Bald Now" to sound like a New Pornographers song? (Canadian indie rock Easter egg!)
Pun Master.
bratz is better :)
You angrily twerking had me dying omg
this video is 2 days old and so far thats 127K holes dug that kelly can fall into... but whos counting?
as someone who grew up actively playing barbie pc games, bratz games stomp on barbie games. i’m 23 years old and still sometimes play bratz rock angelz and bratz forever diamonds on gamecube LOL
Dylan twerking to body had no right being as funny as it was
Hey man, I know you're not gonna read this but; When I was a kid I moved around a lot, and ironically these two movies were what I watched to give me comfort during those times. I actually ended up getting Barbie Mariposa within my third moving of houses, and I stopped watching Barbie Rapunzel. In any case, right now I'm going through a tough time, and I just want you to know that this video gave me a lot of comfort. I was not expecting these two very specific movies to ever come back into my life.  Thank you.
VRG
I had a lot of MyScene dolls as a kid, which I've only now realized is also from Mattel. I've always thought of them as a cross between Barbie and Bratz (which I thought were ugly), but apparently they were actually created to compete with Bratz.
Kurtis Connor discussing Barbie vs bratz? Oh hell yes oh f**k yeah
Okay but I fucking love Otto the weasel. He slaps
i dont remember the last time a youtube video made me laugh so many times
🎶 🕺Rapunzel is bald now!💃 🎶 We gotta get a full song.
10:15 WHAT THE FUCK
This whole video made me laugh out loud.
Rematch against monster high dolls!
Ok but please play the barbie rapunzel pc game vs the bratz rock angels ps2 game
Lets GOOOO! Bratz gang!!
No second greeting? I hate u kurmis
omg no there’s way better ones than rapunzel (i love bratz too)
22:06 I really needed this I swear to god I’ve never laughed so hard PLS IM CRYING DHSHSJSBSJEJEHEBE
How the hell did you get over a million views in a day ?
Damn I kinda wished he watched the Princess and the Pauper one, the songs are sooo good. And Preminger's in it, so.
I need a part two
10000/10 best video for sure i laughed so hard i spilled all the tea i was drinking and i dont regret it hahaha
Excuse me, Kurtis, you mention kelly's forehead but when Stephan's younger brother said this bit;  him: "Stephan" Stephan: "yeah?" him: "oh nothing, I'm just glad you're my brother"  You say absolutely nothing??????? Me and my sister keeps quoting that to this day at random times 😂😂😂😂😂
Your best work to date
that was not fair, barbies movie should have been princess and the pauper </3
Kurtis this video is a loyalty test
hi kurtis
I hated Bratz dolls cause they had a big scary head lol  Barbie movies are hole mood tho xD
*angry twerks*
No one gonna talk about the mushroom when they put on the glasses? The “pixies” are def just a shrooms trip
I LOVED the sound of footsteps and shoes in Barbie movies
I was promised an extra greeting if I subscribed. I'm unsubscribing
All the bad bitches knew Bratz was gonna win
Fun fact: i loved bratz when i was younger and this is one of the movies that i knew all of the words … so imagine how fast I clicked on this video when i saw the movie cover
Absolutely APPALLED, I only subscribed SPECIFICALLY for that extra greeting!!!!
K,but is anyone gonna acknowledge the “Do I wanna gnome?” part or was that just a fever dream?
😂 😆 lol
i'm sorry but Kurtis singing "Rapunzel is bald now" kills me every time
KURTIS YOU SHOULD HAVE WATCHED THE FAIRYTALE BRATZ MIVIE ITS SO MF GOOD THAT NARRATOR FROG GAVE ME LIFE
DO MORE OF TGESE
Please do a part two I’ve been pissing myself at the weasel for like 15 minutes
Watching one of my fave movies from my childhood get absolutely desecrated by Kurtis,, he’s right but he didn’t have to say it lmao
It’s like the not a doctor credit in Michael shur shows but replace it with not a virgin
can u add the weasel's moan to ur soundboard pls? for vrg :•)
Kurtis could do a video about a chicken's farm on a hill and I would find it interesting, how does he do that?
Does that mean that barbie is on team balls.... Damn childhood ruined
'I'm sending a cease and desist to the son of a bitch who invented Mondays' I'm sorry but just put that over a trap track and BARS.
lol dolls are where it's at
I said I love you, and I mean it. But I would never wear those ugly clothes kurtis damn
This video is off the rails
I actually still have the Barbie as Rapunzel on VCR...
If you subscribed to Kurtis Conner and didn't receive an extra greeting that you were promised, you may be entitled to some compensation. There is a class action lawsuit which demands Mr. Conner pay out the sum of One Extra Greeting to every subscriber if we win the court case
Kurtis nails in this vid are a snapshot of my life fr
Never have I regretting leaving my barbie movie collection in my home country until now 🤣
Do the extra greeting Kurt 🔪🔪🔪
Cancel kurtis for not doing the extra greeting
Bratz FTW
I liked bratz because of the diversity tbh, a white, asian, black , hispanic doll is not something u see at that time
PLEASE look up the scientifique name of horned owl !!!!
ok but when you said "in reality theres obviously no difference" I got flashbacks to when Louis Tomlinson said "in reality ObVIoUsLY theres no  truth to it oBvIOuSly"
I love you omg
Okay. Now make a video of how Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse was the best Barbie Show 🔫
Ya hooo da ba yo
can't believe I didn't get an extra greeting I'm unsubbing🖐🏻😔
tbh the rapunzel movie isnt that good… my favorite is princess and the pauper and that’s only for my lord and savior preminger
Omg I watched those movies religiously as a kid, Barbie and Bratz both. Me and my sister had so many Bratz. Yasmin gang 🤟
3:00 that’s kind of EXACTLY what happened 😂
18:58 Kurtis I see you👀👀👀💀💀
I laughed so hard when Bratz said EW
the pixie world is basically just what you see when you're high
ALL THE DOLL STANS ARE COMING YOU BETTER WATCH OUT KURTIS
I support it
Also my mom wouldn’t let me play with Bratz bc she said I already acted like a brat enough I didn’t need more influence😩
barbie rapunzel and bratz fashion fairies were both of my favorites from each franchise as a child so i feel very seen
ive see both of these as a kid and it was pretty surreal to see kurtis watch both of them
i alrdy knew brats was superior
How fucking dare you not give me an extra greeting! It’s my right as a loyal subscriber, you’re an absolute clown
I want a extra greeting now
When u said the letters weren’t for virgin I was thinking ‘Curtis doesn’t seem like a Virgo and he definitely doesn’t seem like the type to tell ppl he is a Virgo’ very really good makes much more sense
unsubscribing because i didnt get my extra greeting
The Barbie Diaries is the best Barbie movie I will die on that hill. (It is also a nightmare to look at)
"Hey bro, nice gnome hose."
i was allowed to play with barbies even though i didnt like them (i would cut their hands anf feet off....yeah...) but when i started to want bratz my mom said absolutely not bc they were "trashy"
You will never be forgiven for this betrayal. My extra greeting, gone!
I need this to be a series

Kurtis is a cute man. I would date his so badly. Too bad I'm from Brazil.
Kurtis just ruined my favorite barbie movie.
Woody is the better doll just letting u know
Barbie and the Bratz are all queens and wouldn't want us to fight over who's the best
Here’s the thing, when I was little I never thought about how the bodies of barbies or bratz looked like at all, I only did once I was older and heard adults complaining about it. Idk I never felt pressured by a toy, and I feel like any female doll made will always be accused of being over sexualized unless they’re overweight. Sorry if this offends some people, I’m just saying my view.   Great video though!
more barbie movie reviews in the future plssssss
Kurtis knows his audience.
this is monster high erasure kurtis. make a part 2 about why monster high is the best objectively because it has cat girls
pls review the barbie classics that everyone loves: Barbie Princess and the Pauper, and barbie and the 12 dancing princesses (or barbie and the magic of the pegasus)
BALDPUNZEL
Bratz are traaaash to me
Im so happy you chose rapunzel, its my fav Barbie movie
this man is perfect.
kurtis pls watch bratz movies with the tweevils (ex: rock angelz) they're so funny
You are an adult man right?
18:16  missed opportunity to say "scariest scene i've ever SCENE"
Kurtis, you’re popping off right now tbh
ok but can we talk about the bratz babyz movies?? specifically bratz super babyz with the potato aliens...... what was that
Every time Kurtis dissed on Kelly 04:56 - 05:16 07:22 - 07:45 07:48 - 07:50 08:17 - 08:23 14:32 - 14:33 20:12 - 20:14  26:20 - 26:24 28:00 - 28:05
Oh no Kurtis is going through his edgy teenage phase
THESE WERE MY CHILDHOOD BUT I DO NOT REMEMBER THESE TO BE SO LOW QUALITY OMG
Omgggg he has post malone’s wiener dog mustache😂😭😭honestly 10/10
Now this is top tier content
You sneeze like my mom. Always feels like your throat must be bleeding after THAT BIG OF A SNEEZE
Flying unicorn? You mean a Pegasus right?
Love these long videos!!!
I used to watch that Barbie movie with my little sister and the chase scene used to make me so angry because just the sound of the foot steps
My names Kelly....I feel personally attacked 😂😂😂
im worried about kurtis' FBI agent at this point
Okay I am the only that got a little upset at the why didnt Penelope just fly away with Rapunzel part? Like Penelope couldnt fly well until Rapunzel gets locked up and she absolutely has to? Like Kurtis how did you miss that
These are like my two favorite movies of each lmao but bratz forever bf bad bitch vibes
Corny diesel
never thought the day that kurtis talks about bratz would arrive..... i feel at peace.
I  love how the only part Kurtis found unrealistic in the Bratz movie was that people were dancing with powder falling from the ceiling
I always think Virgo when I see the VRG 🤭 I thought Kurtis was flaunting his sign initially but he wasn't 😞✌️
creep
I watched Barbie rapunzel all the time as a kid and the weasel never phased me not I’m really concerned so thanks kurtis for giving me a therapy topic
People are crazy but this dude is pretty good and has a future in entertainment because he is just himself and that sells. Good luck my man.
I thought he was gonna say the vrg really means he’s a Virgo
Yahoo da ba yo
Lowkey thot kurtis was gonna hit us with a Trixie Mattel interview
Let's be real. You chose B as R because of this tiktok voice over. Am I right? Yes, I am.   Barb as Rapunz is the real sh¡t. Watched it recently, intentionally on my 27th year of living and I loved it. This weasle though. It's not pg13 for sure. It's like if it was a stupid ass comedy by Adam Sandler (love them).
I can't imagine Gothel attending all these *Balls*
My girl Kelly probably sees in IMAX 😩😕
Don’t ever compare the amazing barbie cinematic universe to bratz
The Bratz video games! I stayed up all night playing them!
Ya hoo da ba yo    :D
𝕸𝖆𝖌𝖎𝖈𝖆𝖑𝖑𝒚  𝕯𝖔𝖕𝖊.... Here i come..
The fact that it was just a ripoff version of Barbie and not the real one 😂
Okay I’m not even gonna watch the video but here’s the tea.  Bratz for playing with.  Barbie for iconic chonky animated movies.  Both over anything todays kids have to endure.
I 100% assumed that the goal for a lot people on tiktok was in fact to dress like a bratz doll. Especially if you’re a girl with a passion for fashion. 🤣 Also, that paintbrush stayed in my psyche since I saw the movie a bazillion years ago. Mostly cuz I’m sad it wasn’t real.
Team barbie
If you really wanna compare you gotta do Barbie magic pegasus and Bratz Rock Angles.
These were two of my favourite movies when I was a kid
This absolute madlad used the Greendale flag as a Barbie's asshole, that is tight ànd legit!
You referenced Chalk Zone and it warms my heart 😭❤️
kurtis taking back control of kurtistown ... the anarchy was over before it even got started
12:23 AHHHH! 😂😂😂😭
YOOOOOOOOOO, I'M PENELOPE!
Omg PLEASE play the Bratz and Brabie video games.   Personally I love Bratz Rock Angels
sad that i was only allowed to watch barbie as a kid, I really was missing out on bratz :/
my parents didn’t want me playing with bratz bc they thought it would give me a bad attitude, as if i didn’t already have one as a child💀
Im so offended that you didn't choose princess and the pauper
I loved the barbie movies xd
I thought those letters stood for vine, reddit, google
This guy got on trending but he couldn’t even have the courtesy (kurtis-y?) to include an extra greeting 👺
hedwig was a girl
I watched barbie Rapunzel so many times as a kid 😭😭😭. Just relived my entire childhood
Bratz are Barbies for future thots.
ya hooo da ba yo
You forgot about the third and better option that is monster high
What is wrong with her neck/head? XD  at 14:28
Lame.af
This is by far the best video of yours
I'm so glad this video is on trending. Now everyone can know about Virgin Really Good podcast <3
wow i remember wen u had less than million subs and now look at you top 5 in trending congratulations bro
Bts fans quaking at the rabbit hobi
man i remember watching these movies i loved the video Kurtis
stephan runs like a character from elder scrolls oblivion
Kurtis I’m sorry I’m too emotionally attached to barbie movies sjsj pls it’s my childhood like the moment the painting scene popped up I almost cried sjsj also I’ve been laughing for 20 minutes bc of the gnome joke
i had to pause and take a moment for the "so no hedwig"
Bless you
Bratz is better the barbie
You think you’re getting canceled for not saying hello to me. Your getting cancelled because out of all the rupaunzel movies to match this one you didn’t CHOSE FAIRYTOPIA IT WAS RIGHT THERE
Hey! He's our mayor. He's definitely not a virgin.
barbie easily scales to multiversal she has all the forms known to man
I always forget how inappropriate kurtis Connor is. Don't watch this with your family.
Oh, I always thought the letters in the backround stood for "aVeRaGe" :D
just started this but you had best not shit on barbie and the twelve dancing princesses i know bratz is probably better but i watched the SHIT out of that movie
pls do fairy secret and sleepover adventure next im begging
missed opportunity to compare fairy secret to fashion pixies
As a kid, the huge heads of bratz dolls freaked me out, so I preferred barbies
I SUBSCRIBED FOR THE EXTRA GREETING, THIS IS FALSE ADVERTISING!
was waiting on that extra greeting until the end... instead i get a sneeze. sad.
no special greeting ON PURPOSE NOW? and on the video that is TRENDING? my kurtis citizen is offended
bratz was the barbie doll for kids whose parents didnt care enough about them and who probably lived off section 8 housing
Polly pockets, barbie, bratz, monster high, and littlest pet shops  Legit any 2000’s kids childhood is golden if you played with any of these >~<
I'm glad you cover the important stuff on this channel
If I didn't get my extra greeting because Kurtis forgot, I understand? But on purpose? I'm unsubscribing. I'm hurt, Kurt.
As much as I like you Kurtis and because of the fact that we live in a society where another opinion can’t be tolerated I’ll have to give your Video a thumbs down. Barbie is the winner
I love u and ur humour too much
Yoooo I've never heard someone mention chalk zone before, I loved that show
PLEASEEEEE WHEN HE WAS DANCING @ 23:42 I CANT
Bratz dolls were so fucking ugly. Barbies weren't much better.
you are so great!!!
Did everyone forget about my scene dolls?? Basically Barbie copying brats style 😅
barbie movies slap
You picked the beste Barbie movie 😎
okay but we all know monster high is far more superior now.
not me actually going and getting water and food in the middle of the video when he said we could 😭
XD
We're these 2 of the lowest rated ones? Bc there are actually some good Barbie movies with original plots.
I preferred bratz dolls and I remember my friend had the airplane ✈️
Keep going bro., you’ve really inspired me to keep going with my gaming channel.,!
I love you and your mustache 😩🤌
THE RAPUNZEL BARBIE MOVIE, I am being transported to my childhood, I loved this film so much fjfkfk
I'm sorry but you chose like the worst options for each )):
I'm a Barbie girl, Bratz are straight up terrifying
you kinda remind me of the weasel
I think he didn’t give us that extra greeting cuz of the virgin thing. 😟 sowey
Wow with no extra greeting whats the point? Unsubscribed.
does he edit his videos himself?
My sisters didn't really play with either of these dolls. Well, they started out with barbies but when they found out there were sailor moon dolls, that's all they wanted lol. No Bratz at all
he chose the worst barbie movie 😭😭😭
I remember watching this movie and everyone the gnomes would show up I couldn’t watch I told my mom about it and she had the audacity to to then have a garden full of gnomes let’s just say I definitely broke at least two on purpose👏(dusting my hands off not *clapping*)
I have to disagree, I love the little garden gnome
what about my scene dolls
I  NEED A PART 2
YES YOU CHOSE BARBIE AS RAPUNZEL LETS GO THAT MOVIE IS THE GREATEST AND ALSO THE CGI IS CREEPY AS HELL
We stan Bratz
I’ve been trying to convince people for years, but no soundtrack will ever come close to Bratz. Just saying. “Make You Wanna Dance”? Banger. “You Got It”? Fucking banger. “EVERYTHING”?!!! Absolute bloody banger. Highly recommend. 10/10
pls watch barbie diaries
The fact you didn't react to Barbie the princess and the pauper is a crime
Omg that witch is also in barbie swan lake the barbie cinematic universe is amazing
The reason why you chose this bratz movie and not Bratz: starrin’ and stylin’ is beyond me
5 ON TRENDING GOOD JOB MY DUDE
Rudy's got the chalk
I’m so glad someone else thinks the children were creepy as shit
dislike i want extra greeting OR I WILL UNSUB
For some reason that Barbie repunzel movie used to be my favorite 🧍🏽‍♀️
1 mio views in 1 day wow
I legit got a jumpscare when kelly showed up, im scared
i used to watch the barbie movie all the time
It’s so funny that you reviewed these two movies in particular. Barbie Rapunzel was my favourite when I watched it as a kid. And I remember hating the Bratz Pixies movie because I was so used to the barbie movies where the characters become the magical being. It really gave me a new perspective on both and though I’m still biased to the Rapunzel movie, I don’t think I’d be so hard on the Pixie movie if I watched it again.
I love this
Not me getting a barbie movie add on this video! lol  ^^
21:27
Why am i even subscribed if no extra greeting?
Lol
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE EXTRA GREETINGS I AMANBSHDUWJQ
Chchchch chalk zone
I'm sorry that bratz movie looked horrendous 😂😂
DOTH THOU CARPET MATCH THY DRAPES
all i know is that barbie as the princess and the pauper shaped me into the person i am today
how dare you call the bratz briannas and slyviedicks "friends" kurtis. apology NOW.
Ah yes. The legendary weasel origin.
I haven’t seen a single comment about the James Charles jab—
Petition for Kurtis to say “it’s Very Really Good to see you again” instead of “it’s really good to see you again”
This video is like the Wish version of Jenny Nicholson’s Barbie video
Petition for Kurtis to say “it’s Very Really Good to see you again” in the beginning of every video
Petition for Kurtis to say “it’s Very Really Good to see you again” in the beginning of every video instead of “it’s really good to see you again”
Kurtis talking about unrealistic beauty standards and inclusivity and then dissing the little Barbie for having a big forehead.
damn i remember having the Barbie MP3 player and you could customize your online Barbie avatar to look like your MP3 player
that barbie movie was honestly my childhood
kurtis not giving me extra greetings is, him waking up and choosing violence
I want Kurtis to play Star Stable Online so bad
I had a bratz blanket going up.
I feel like I preferred bratz because they were easier to relate to in a way. I do have favorites of Barbie movies, like the diamond castle and raphunzel (cause satisfying sound effects/nostalgia lol).  However, the Barbie movies were just basic to me, while the Bratz were just more cooler and also had more humor(?). I also preferred the Bratz dolls unique styles to Barbies as well.
I saw this video right before my exam and oh God, I had to control the urge to not watch it right away
make this a series bestie
I listened Bratz Rock Angelz album religiously, it's so good!
Omg kurtis’s “im desperate” joke is so so so good I’m dying
the time and effort u put into ur videos really shows, its so organized and funny as always :D we love u kurtis
18:59 - that bo burnham video on his watch next list. love that.
i can't with the weasel moan 😂😂
ya hooo da ba yo
i hate the fact that i remember this  Bratz movie after 13 years
*angry twerking*
Virgin->virg->vrg🤷🏼
Please pray for my mom who's in the ICU on a ventilator fighting for her life against this virus for 5 weeks now and not looking good with multiple infections. Her name is Doris. I don't have much family and we're very close. If you can take a second to pray for her please.
Do more bratz or barbie movie reviews! :D
Kurtis I just had such deja vu to my childhood when u showed that clip of the gnome omfg
someone has GOT to tell kurtis how a pulley system works
me: scrolling my 1000th refreshed home page "Barbie vs. Bratz" me: Okay, lit
I don't have a big forhead
Wouldn't be funny if he did next bratz Vs monster high?
ok now play bratz rock angels
Kurtis looks like someone from the 80's.
This shit on trending
the gnome’s eyebrows look like crinkle cut oven chips
Came for Jenny Nicholson's brand, have you?
This, do you like this?
I’ve watched a lot of the Barbie movies with my client. They get better ! 😭
I guess you could say the confusion about those letters left Kurtis on the VeRGe of insanity
i wasn't allowed to buy bratz as a kid which kind of breaks my heart, especially when they came out with the rock angelz dolls because they looked so cool lol,, but the barbie movies hold a super special place in my heart, especially princess & the pauper and 12 dancing princesses
14 years later and I'm still so confused by who is Breeana, Cymbeline’s and Lina. Why do they all look the same
9:30 Pretty sure that's why she loops it around the pole. So the pressure isn't on her head it's on the pole.
hedwig is a girl-
The dancing was so fucking funny
1) penelope can't fly over the magic wall,  so even if she did manage to get rapunzel out of the tower there's no way for them to escape  2) if gothel kept her trapped in the tower unable to leave from the beginning, who would make her tea and do all the chores? SHE would have to do them, bc she lives behind a magic wall with someone she kidnapped 😬
barbie v.s. bratz is #5 on trending     ya love to see it
i have unsubed 0:40
I know i signed up for it but the extra greeting was actually getting kinda annoying so im okay with  leaving them out from time to time.
Kurtis mentioning the legendary weasel is all I’ve ever wanted in life
Unrelated but all of the barbie movies, all of them are gay. The directors were just cowards to not make any of them kiss.
Need another video like that one
I haven't been feeling good lately but I laughed so much watching this video so thank you for making my day, Kurtis. Much love ❤️
I think this is the least interesting video I've ever seen on the trending page.
i haven't watched the video yet but are you seriously telling me the barbie movie he picks is rapunzel and not princess and the pauper... lord
More please, Kurty. :-)
Hell nah y’all tripping if this be trending….straight tripping balls 6:35
I'm sorry but the classic barbie movies are just iconic
You HAVE to react to Barbie's Princess and the Pauper
These are such random choices for movies, there are better barbie and bratz ones ):
bratz were better dolls and had better merch in general, but barbie had the best movies. hands DOWN.
Bratz vs Barbie played a huge part in my childhood until monster high came onto the scene
You should do monster high dolls too
Okay, but as a Barbie movie stan, I think it's real brave to talk shit about Kelly who has the proportions of a real human child who might exist (respect to all 5heads), while every single character model in the Bratz movie had some facial deformity. Like RIP to the people with concave noses and eyes that take up 90% of your head but, come on 😭  I KNOW there are Bratz movies with better animation, that one just wasn't it. I literally started crying when I saw the girl on the right at 19:14. Pretty much all of the evil pixies will haunt me.
This is the funniest shit ever i almost peed my pants 😭😭💀
no wait i only watch your videos all these yrs for the extra greeting it gives my ego some validation
wait holy shit kurtis is #5 on trending
ya hooo da ba yo
give him to mEeee oOoaah
Real G's appreciate both 💯
it wouldnt hurt if she was holding the top bit, or like the top bit was relaxed
For a guy who has never watched a Barbie or Bratz movie in his life until now, you managed to pick my favourite Barbie and Bratz movie for this video. You are a legend thank you 👏🏼😊
Is it just me or are all bratz movies nightmare fuel?????
It’s funny how Kurtis has actually turned country
Damn you're a fine ass man yummeeee !!
Caught u on Omegle
Barbie life in the dreamhouse was the best though
MONSTER HIGH NEXT ?!? (´·ω·`)
“matell me that” is the best part of this video
✨ do I wanna gnome ✨
I only clicked on this video for the extra greeting I would say I feel scammed but I'm not subbed either
I finally subscribed, this is your first upload since… and I don’t get a GOT DAMN MF *EXTRA GREETING*?!?!?! Despicable. Who is your manager? I’m calling them.
How could you!! I Love that greeting!! /jk
someone’s changed since watching inside
Bratz was obviously always gonna be the right answer 😌
kurtis. i love you. please cut your fucking mustache.
i used to love chalk zone :')
Oh my GOD the dancing bratz characters made cry from laughing
12:13 I thought this was a joke in the beginning, it sounds like when people take clips and just edit in footsteps and shoe squeaking
I subbed for extra greeting.. this is not a threat but a warning you must give me extra greeting
I felt like I got just got bitch slapped by the nostalgia of watching Barbie as rapunzel everyday, if that makes sense…
omg I left at the intermission like kurtis suggested and I forgot to come back until rn lmao
Why would you want your toys to come to life and try to kill you
18:18  is it scarier than the goat story?
has anyone else seen those video compilations of the barbie rapunzel weasel moaning in different languages because they are great.
https://youtu.be/TLd7S4txeYM
now let's talk about monster high and ever after high..
Kurtis this is a great video and now I need a Monster High vs Bratz!
Imagine we put all this money barby made in 2020 in nature
Kelly’s forehead is so large it has an orbit
This is so nice to watch when you’re high lmao
11:57 there was a huge missed opportunity for a Stephen King joke smh
ya hooo da ba yo
Bratz has unrealistic beauty standards for women and it's disgusting. Like honestly, how am I meant to get a head that big!??!
Honestly I just liked because of the gnome joke.
i used to be obsessed with Bratz when they came out... but  I wasn't allowed either Barbie nor Bratz :'( I ended up playing with match box toys... ah the 2000s
the barbie three musketeers movie is still my fucking SHIT i don't even care
I wondered when he was going to stop doing extra greeting, he's been looking dead inside everytime he says it at the start of the episode and I understand why
Live action Bratz movie,, one of the actresses was a super baby
Kurtis please watch the live action Bratz movie
LOOK Whose on the TRENDING Page!! 👾👾👾😀
Him not calling the bratz Jade and Sasha is really taking a hit out of my childhood
I know we're not talking games but the bratz ps2 games were literally my entire childhood. To this day im so sad i cant play that game anywhere anymore.
Watch Barbie fairytopia mermadia
“kelly is a goddamn nightmare to look at” true
okay but youre forgetting about the best of them all..... the My Scene dolls, and their movies and video games! i was OBSESSED. to this day the theme song is stuck in my head
just so you know penelope didnt fly to get her before because she was scared of flying - thats why her dad hates her but it was a big scene where she finally flew over the magic wall!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
dude bratz fashion pixiez was my favorite movie
Wtf is going on it this
Am I the only one sad about the absence of the extra greeting?
I can't believe bestie could have chosen magic of the pegasus, mermaidia, swan lake, princess and the pauper, or even magic of the 12 bloody princesses - but no :(( bestie goes for one of the most boring ones rip rupunzel *cries in barbie*
Hello kurtis balls  😆 should've mad a joke about that part
i had fashion pixies on dvd and would watch it religiously on my hello kitty themed t.v. set. it made me the woman i am today (sadly)
My kids used to watch these. I remember noticing a distinct change in the animation. All of the productions companies started outsourcing to India. Sometimes it went really bad, but sometimes it was ok
kurtis needs to watch barbie in the princess and the pauper
Kurtis, 27: *releases a 30 minute video about brats and barbies* Me, 22: ah, finally some relevant content
out of most gnome jokes "do i wanna gnome" was high on the scale
Omfg so happy for this video 😍🤩
https://youtu.be/qEu-umL8M_A ..
This was an extra goofy one. I love it
https://youtu.be/qEu-umL8M_A ..
I really think that the moustache suits him
https://youtu.be/TLd7S4txeYM
i am so upset about the lack of extra greeting
I am so shocked that Kurtis didn’t mention A Link Between Worlds as a similarity to walking through paintings in Rapunzel. Also Kurtis, my guy, you NEED to review the Barbie Princess and the Pauper movie. It is quality 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
the best bratz movie is the passion 4 fashion diamondz one. hands down.
John 3:16-18  Jesus loves you, and died for our sins.  Jesus is coming back very soon to judge this world and set up his kingdom that will reign forever and ever. Hell is real, hell wasn't made for humans but for fallen angels but if you reject Jesus and his sacrifice you will end up in hell. Repent before it is too late. Please i plead with you for the sake of God  .
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Both of them were my childhood so their both good to me even if I cringe sometimes when I remember them.
NO CAUSE ⟟ REMEMBER THR BRATZ MOIVE FROM WHEN ⟟ WAS YOUNGER
9:40 bruh she wrapped her hair around the pillar taking the weight off her head and onto the pillar. She ain't stupid.
https://youtu.be/TLd7S4txeYM
the reason it works for the guy to climb up rapunzel's hair, is because she first twists it around the pillar/column - which means the pillar is taking on the strength/weight/force of the guy as opposed to her head - ever brushed through really knotty hair and held onto your hair between your scalp and the brush so that it doesn't hurt as much - yeah same shit, just on a way larger scale. :))
pull any of this “no extra greeting” shit one more time and you’re going to loose 1 subscriber. consider yourself warned
kurtis slightly resembles the weasel
FASHION PIXIEZ WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE BRATZ MOVIES<3333
Okay but 'Barbie and the three musketeers' and 'Barbie in a diamond castle' are my absolute favourites!!! And some of the bratz movies as well, like the one where they go to London or sth
when i was a kid i hated bratz because... idk they're heads were too fucking big and they were called "bratz" and that's a dumb name and they look weird and i was #teambarbie and they had a bad sense of fashion. (I'm not saying those were valid reasons i just remember that those were my reasons)
Barbie is better. Change my opinion.
Anyone is upset that he chose Rapunzel for the barbie movie. There are wayyyy better Barbie movies than that :(((
here come the comments saying "why did you do this barbie movie!!"  it's me i'm that comment UMMM WHY DIDNT YOU DO BARBIE AND THE TWELVE DANCING PRINCESSES OR BARBIE A CHRISTMAS CAROL OR BARBIE MARIPOSA OR BARBIE MERMAIDIA? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU???
6:09 - 6:26 Dude I can’t breathe 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I really forgot the Bratz movies other than the one where they go to europe cause my god this unlocked memories
The bratz theme song will be forger drilled in my head
WE DIDNT GET AN EXTRA GREETING #KURTISCONNERISOVERPARTY SHOULD BE TRENDING AGAIN
من به کمک احتیاج دارم
His moustache really distracted me wtf, I couldn't really focus on the video much
bratz rock angel is the superior movie obviously
Crazy how he keeps calling Sasha Chloe Jade and yasmin the side character’s friends when they are the main characters 🧍🏾‍♀️
#kurtisisoverparty I can't believe that you purposely didn't do the extra greeting
I'm genuinely surprised he didn't go with the Fairytopia or Mermaidia Barbie movie I feel like Kurtis would've gotten a kick outta Bibble.
Best style: bratz Best movies: Barbie
when he misgenders hedwig :(
You look like the lost 5th member of weezer
KURTIS IS TRENDING YAYYYYYYYYYY
I never actually thought about the Rapunzel hair thing. She'd definitely fall out of the tower or get her neck broken or something.
i just want him to react to Mermaidia 😔😔
KING!!!
Says he gets a lot of action and is not a virgin them proceeds to talk about action figures need I say more...
Barbie's Princess and the Pauper goes hard bro especially the songs
Kurtis: I subscribed 4 years ago BECAUSE you told me to subscribe for an extra greeting. Every single week I say it with you. This was deeply upsetting and I hope you never do this to me again.  Sincerely, An extra greeting, subscribing member of Kurtis Town
Best barbie movie: Princess and the pauper I also like Swan Lake, Nutcraker and I LOVE 12 Dancing princesses
Bratz fashion pixies was my SHITTTTTTT
What’s the point in subscribing if I don’t get my extra greeting?! 😡
Barbie has better movies
bratz supremacy
👸 + 💃🏻/ 🕺🏻 + 🏰 = ⚽️    Def not = 🥜:)
okay but, MONSTER HIGH???
I haven't watched barbie Rapunzel movie in years but how did I watch this shit lol. Also btw there's way better barbie movies than this. NEVER RELEASE A PRISIONOR WITH A LYING FART.
Very Really Good? More like Virginity Really Good. Gottem.
Bratz??? I used to have their games, their dolls, the movies. Never missed one. I still know all their songs.
Barbie vs Bratz...the old but gold fight continues
Barbie is true kino and Bratz is pandering schlock and you can't convince me otherwise
You're #5 on trending my dude, you frickin made it. You are immortalized in our current internet culture. You're literally the most important person alive at this moment. You're literally the most important person to me at this moment. Wyd rn 👀
THEYRE CALLED ~PEGASUS~ KURT
VRG = ViRGin
I was surprised how genuinely upset I was when we didn't get an extra greeting 🤦‍♀️😭
Monster high next
kurtis conner more like kurpiss conner. (this is not a hate comment)
kurpiss
https://youtu.be/TLd7S4txeYM
yahoo dabayo
ayo kurtis merch kinda be popping off 🥵
not the whites calling barbie an icon its monster high and bratz that take the award 🤸🏾‍♀️
next video abt [as] maybe
this is genuinely my favorite content to watch when i’m very really good : 🍃
What about myspace
the first person i’ve ever seen remember chalk zone completely unrelated but i genuinely thought that i was the only one who watched it
Kurtis woke up and chose violence with that video title
Me over here with my monster high  👁👄👁
that was my favorite barbie movie was a kid! i would make my mom go down to the grocery store down the street to rent it for me over and over every single week and i watched it probably 100 times
I love the editing style of this video (and the concept). It was very fun to watch and I genuinely laughed out loud multiple times. Really great content, Kurtis! 🤩
Barbie outdirected 💅🏻
kurtis i am begging you to watch a better barbie movie. 12 dancing princesses is right there
The plots are inspired from the clasical tales.The "no parents", special objects,weird friends(like animals),love interest,the bad guy that gets punished to show that the good always win...all of this has a deeper meaning and I had to learn about em in highschool and analyze everything🙄
Love this omg
Gnomes have pisskinks confirmed…. They pEe oUt tHe fires... and also enjoy when dogs pee on them 🙄💔
live action casting: Kurtis as the weasel.

* subscribes for extra greeting *  * doesn’t get that extra greeting *  Me: And i took that personally
BRATZ 4 LIFE 😤😤😤🤩🤩
ball scrolls? more like testi-scrolls.
A head to head death match between the two is…. Barbie-ric…..  not good. Sorry.
https://youtu.be/TLd7S4txeYM
Uh so like what’s up with barbies hair in 14:27👀
Please react to ALL Barbie movies, especially Barbie Fairytopia franchise
18:17 hes baisically telling them to get the fuck away from his yard because its late
no extra greeting :(
Kurtis why did you tape a dead rat to your lip??
Monster high: 13 wishes is the best one
I need more of this thanks
Why is it so funny to me that bratz were more popular in the uk
I loved this
Nah, Bratz is still worse than Barbie in terms of sexualization because Barbie is an adult and Bratz hyper-sexualizes children and teens and even has dolls of toddlers in full glammer makeup with big DSLs and wearing basically langerie, so yes Barbie is guilty, too, but Bratz is much worse and more fucked up with it, especially now that Barbie is at least starting to address it and diversity stuff and work to improve both.
If anyone is ever narrating something about my life, I sincerely hope they can honestly add “and Dylan twerks about it.” I need to meet some Dylans.
Barbies movies are at a whole other level ah
Those pixies aren’t bad they just want everybody to get their groove on!
i got to know the bratz thnaks to the movies omg
21:26 I CANT BREATHE
I subscribed for an extra greeting at the beginning of EVERY video!! It’s ok I forgive you
don’t even have to watch the video. barbie wins by a landslide.
Why no one talking about 'do I wanna gnome'???  I laughing so damn hard. 😭😭😭
call back after you've seen barbie princess and the pauper. one of our generation's musical masterpieces
kurtis INTENTIONALLY scams fans, claims to provide 2nd greeting to subscribers and is HAPPY they are fooled!!!
as someone who has a fear of gnomes and is a hard core arctic monkeys fan, i demand an apology video
Barbie Mariposa is better than this barbie as rapunzel movie.
bratz rock angelz was MY cultural reset. the video game just ugh... chef's kiss
Simba Lynn
Bruh why didn't this video show up in my feed the day it came out, tf? Even scrolling through my subs I didn't see it. Offended. 🙄
he picked the worst barbie movie 💀
I was going to my bathroom that way my boyfriend wouldn't see my self-harm. (I'm having a lot of trauma and other stuff I'm sure you don't want to hear about.) I went to my bathtub, filled it up, and had my razor ready. I opened YouTube and saw this video. I started watching, laughing, smiling. I forgot my whole intention of coming into this tub. Thank you Kurtis. As cheesy as this whole story sounds, you saved me.
I liked the Barbie nutcracker movie as a kid. :3 I watched it several times. Also, I never realized how crazy Kelly looked. I related to Kelly as a kid. Dang. Lol.  Btw you’re funny as hell. I love your videos.
I’m srry but the bratz movie Gave and that’s that.💀
the best barbie movies are fairytopia and princess and the pauper..... i mean bibble alone makes fairytopia 10/10
The tip toe animation fucking sent me
Neighbor's kid: 23:38
Tha me for making our day with your videos!!
Kinda bummed about the lack of an extra greeting tbh
i can't believe nobody is talking about that "Do I wanna gnome?" bit. i'm SOBBING with laughter
Kurtis, I subscribed for a extra greeting.. I would like to get what I subscribed for damn it!!
I can't believe bratz blatantly stole the plot point of a main character being cursed to live as a tree for many years from the hit novel Fallout Equestria
I love you but why are you like this.
“So no hedwig?”  Subbed
you have to watch the myscene movies that's what was created by barbie to compete with bratz!!!!!
Weasel down baddddddd
You really chose the ONE Barbie movie I have in my house
Barbie princess charm school is where it’s at!
bless you
are we not gonna talk about the apology part where the channel said james charles I DIED
I hope Bobby Flay knows he's loves round here😪🌸
annoyed that kurtis went through this whole video calling the bratz “bryannas friends.” put some respect on chloe, yasmin, sasha, and jade.
I thaught VGR stood for : Very Really Greg
Early 2000 Barbie movies are savage
I only subscribed for the extra greeting 😔
plz plz plz do more oof
dont let him watch Barbie Swan Lake cause there are way too many kids in that one
WHATS THE POINT OF SUBBING IF I DONT GET AN EXTRA GREETING... unsubbing 😭
15:40 the runescape graphics
Im not comparing the two, but doesn't his mustache look like an earlier version of stalin's mustache?
when I was little, I used to have barbie as rapunzel on vhs and watch it every damn day but idk why the dragons gave me nightmares </3
https://youtu.be/TLd7S4txeYM
I want RealDoll's that looks like a Bratz, and I also want monster high RealDoll's.
Kurtisssss! my good mayor,.... thank you so much for this
Luv this vid bro!!!! 💀🤣💀🤣🙌👏
I subscribed for the extra greeting after binge-watching 20+ videos and now I don't feel special. Unsubscribed... I'm sorry, but you did this to yourself
1 million likes/holes for kelly, frick kelly
"ya hooo da ba yo". words to live by.
Cut that beard
The reverbed “balls” is unnecessarily funny
OMG I TOTALLY FORGOT ABOUT THIS BRATZ MOVIE OMG
this video is currently helping me go through a paranoia episode and im crying in my bathroom.
So when the fire hydrant scene gnome transformation scene happened, the animators snuck in realistic looking magic mushrooms next to it. Which makes sense. By realistic looking I mean that usually red mushrooms with white polka dots are shown but those are actually amanitas which aren’t psychedelic but deliriant. Like the emoji 🍄. Whereas actual psilocybin mushroom cultivars are generally brown, but the ones in the bratz movie are very typical paneolus in appearance!
This is distracting me from the pain of my editing software crashing again for the 3rd time in 4 hours😒
I'm a bratz collector, Kurtis really calling to my niche with this one
Ya hoo da ba yo 😏
Okay but you should’ve watched Fairytopia
I personaly dont like the bratz movie, because diss movie feels like being on LSD
Your vary left aren’t you
Ya hooo da ba yo 😌
How in the world do I remember the Bratz movie so vividly. Like, pardon?
never thought kurtis was a virgin until this video
I love that the Bratz movie he watches in my FAVORITE one
ya hooo da ba yo
finally
I liked barbies more than bratz because I felt like their heads were so huge and I found it weird they had no nose but I used to wish I liked them because my friends would play with bratz. My mom was kind enough to buy me some to pretend I played with them too but I didn’t find it as fun as Barbie because the giant heads didn’t  make me feel like the dolls looked normal. It didn’t help that I had already had barbies to compare the weird overly huge eyes, missing nose, giant head of Bratz
This is your funniest video— I laughed so hard
Bratz were ahead of their fashion line while Barbie was........Barbie.  Bratz series were THAT Iconic even though the plot sucks and the graphics- but Barbie can stick with her ✨Magical Dancing shoes✨   Bratz' Albums were a HIGH quality, meanwhile Barbie just goes with her- Inspirational music   We all know Bratz shouldn't be a comparison because they stayed with their passion-for-fashion, while Barbie goes with no personality "you-can-be-everything" type of gal.   Why are we even comparing these fashion statement gurls to a 50 year-old-Princess that has literally over 100+ careers-
Some of y'all didn't have to wonder why none of the characters in movies looked like you as a kid and it SHOWS
That specific Bratz movie was my childhood
“IM NOT A VIRGIN”  that’s exactly what a virgin would say
Idk if it’s cuz I’m high but this is one of your best videos, like I died over almost every joke, especially the do I wanna gnome
When the first movie was “Barbie As Rapunzel”, I knew we were in for a treat! (Give him to me! Ughhh😩)
When Repunzel Is Bald Now but Repunzel Is Bald Now:
monster high is truly the best tho
wow he is cute
I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IT MEANT VIRGIN!
this is the best video i’ve ever watched
I feel betrayed- why am I subscribed if I don’t get my extra greeting 😡
“And a British rabbit friend named Hobi”  Me: *kpop energy intensifies*
i wish he watched barbie and the 12 dancing sisters
ok hear me out.      L.O.L doll supremacy
8:58 HEDWIGS A GIRL YOU MORON
*The Queen:* YOU'RE USELESS... *Otto the Weasle:* _Give him to me... ÆEUUUGH!_  *Barbie:* What is wrong, Ken? *Ken:* I'm not sure. I feel... a disturbance.

#5 on trending lesgoooo
I swear, seeing these movies makes me feel like i'm having a fever dream
Wait what about monster high
you think that gnomes scary? search "Bratz - are you sure" lmao
I almost wished that he watched Sawn Lake instead since he has such disdain for the child models lol
Kurtis: *decides to compare Bratz and Barbie movies* *Chooses the worst barbie movie*
Hi Kurtis, just thought I'd let you know that the reason Barbies dont have A**holes is because women don't fart or poop. thank
https://youtu.be/qEu-umL8M_A ..
https://youtu.be/qEu-umL8M_A ..
How long the _B A L L S_ reverbed the second time when he introduced the party setting made me choke on air and get a headache I laughed so hard  Edit: oh nO IT WAS IN THERE LIKE 3 MORE TIMES
"Mattel me that" lol
why tf does kurtis have a moustache? how did this happen
I’m so sad kurtis did not comment on what an absolute BANGER the song playing during the pixie party was. Soundtrack of my childhood…
I'm Bobby Flaye, and this, is ranch night
21:27 but without music
https://youtu.be/TLd7S4txeYM
monster high had the best dolls (I’m not talking about the rebranded ones those are BAD but the old ones were cool and double jointed) and the best movies you can’t change my mind
wood chipper? i barely know her  nice
as someone who loved both as a kid, barbie movies are unbeatable, but bratz dolls are superior.
right now there are 114k likes, kelly might as well fall into a black hole. (seriously, no one likes that kid.)
We definitely need a part two. A rematch
VRG= Virgin Ready for God
so we’re just gonna sit here like myscene  dolls didn’t exist? myscene masquerade madness????
The Weasel kinda sounds like Pitbull….
oh my god i keep watching that part with the angry twerking and my lungs are collapsing
Barbied wire. Ingenious.
kurtis!! look at the law suit the guy kind of benedict arnold barbies ass but it was because barbie said no to his bratz designs!
Kurtis  the "friends" are literally Chloe, Sasha, Jade and Yasmin the actual Bratz dollz!!!! Lmaooo
no extra greeting? i feel scammed  & violated 😔
I spent more time than I'm comfortable admitting playing the Bratz Rock Angelz videogame on the GameCube... Yikes.
You need to watch my scene for comparison. Jammin in Jamaica is the best and its full of BOPS!! I literally have a tattoo dedicated to it lmao
Bratz was way better but I will admit Barbie movies was better but Bratz show beats Barbie and the dream house
I LOVED this barbie Repunzel movie as a child. 😭
The do i wanna gnome joke was top tier lmaoo
Never got to watch bratz because it was a "bad influence", but got to watch Caillou
As a Lena I can confirm all of us can turn into crows and cause blizzards
Currently watching this during my first period poop and it’s really helping me thru the pain 👌🏽
The angry twerking made my week 😂😂😂
*W H E R E ' S M Y E X T R A G R E E T I N G*
#5 ON TRENDING BABAY
I was so hyped he watched the fairy bratz movie because that is absolutely the best one
$500 CAD or USD?
i can’t believe you’ve done this
I grew up with Bratz instead of Barbies because of my African American home  I got more into barbie when I was like 9 but I still prefer Bratz till this day cause of the fucking Bratz Rock Angelz soundtrack  this is a subtle jab at Kurtis for not watching Bratz Rock Angelz instead
as a kid i use the play with my barbies all the time but when bratz came out It was game over
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
i also hate every child in the barbie universe.
Samll soldiers! I loved that movie i dont know how Many times i watch that! Btw the crazy Barbies .. till this day creep me out
Kancel kurtis 2021
that "so no Hedwig?" joke was peak comedy
I was really betting on Quentin Tarantino winning that Oscar for horniest weasel :/
as a kid, i used to love the sound when ppl walked in barbie movies the clacks were satisfying lol also i dont even remember the weasel or why it acted so weird
FASHION PIXIES IS THE BEST ONE
does anyone remember myscene dolls lol
She would wrap her hair around a pole first for that to absorb the weight of the man instead of her neck. The tension still might rip but theres magic! That my head cannon anyway! 🤗
why do u look like a dad
please watch princess and the pauper it’ll change your mind
Where all my princess and the pauper girlies at!!!!!!!!
honestly the main reason i preferred bratz to barbie when as a kid was just cause they were more unique and outgoing with their style, while barbie dolls looked really boring to me. not to mention at the time poc barbies were not a big thing at the time 😬 so seeing the same girl everywhere was just meh. i do believe they put more thought into their movies tho so there’s a plus on that! and i think their more expensive dolls( tbh they’re all a lil pricey) like the holiday barbie looked like nice collectibles. but again, expensive as hell 😅
I have a Bratz comforter that I still use because it's the most comfortable blanket I've ever used.
Monster high wins every battle...no questions asked
Surprised the Horniest Weasel award didn’t go to Harvey Weinstein
No extra greeting, that is not wut i was promised, UNSUBSCRIBED.
i’m sorry i had to dislike because i didn’t get an extra greeting
I’m EATING kurtis stop talking about BALLS
the fact that he didn't watch rock angelz 🤬 lmao
I was a bratz kid, my mom wanted me to be into barbies but i found them so boring! I was born in 99’ so bratz was really big when i was a kid. I loved the bratz pixie movie! Also, im mixed so i could connect to the dolls more than the blonde barbies.
I remember watching both movies with keen interest back in the day because they were the only shows that were syndicated on TV in my part of the world and there was no other alternative for a kid to watch on a Sunday afternoon other than news and soap operas.
VRG does not stand for that in Spanish HAHAHAH
might unsubscribe, because what's the point if I don't get the extra greeting.
I was so excited seeing you post this video bc it popped up right after I had found out abt the new bratz mobile game AND rerelease of the original dolls.
I may be in the minority here but I'm honestly glad he didn't do the extra greeting. I would hate to see folks go but he is mayor and he can do whatever tf he wants.
8:56 hedwig is a female
Kurtis I need you to watch the first ever Bratz movie  that I’m aware of unless you find another one that came before it I have never seen another Bratz movie ever just this one the other ones look so stupid but this one is soo good it’s called Bratz the video starin and  stylin I had it on VHS and I found it on YouTube and watched the whole thing it is just as good as I remember https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=b3frPuvE-DU
I never liked Bratz that much as a kid, I was much more drawn to Barbie's fantastical and sparkley movies. Doll wise, I was much more a Monster High kid.
the only thing i didn’t like about bratz is them not having feet like wtf ?? what if she wanted to go swimming she’s gonna have to wear heels for it
Wilhelm and the king should have fallen in love
Bruh my mom never let me have bratz dolls bc of the name and how they looked😐 😒
WHY U GOTTA PICK A WEAK ASS BARBIE MOVIE...
"no hedwig?" sent me to neptune
DOTH THOU CARPETS MATCH THY DRAPES   best thing I’ve ever heard
ok i really like the rapunzel barbie movie growing up but WHAT WERE THEY THINKING with fight scene with no music and the HORNBALL WEASEL??? is this not a kids movie😀 edit: i would like to clarify i do prefer bratz i just grew up watchin them (nothing will beat the movies where they were babies🤣💀 iykyk)
kurtis doesn’t like babylonians 📞📞📢
what the fuck is happening during this video! what!
Welcome to the doll community, where we’re the kids and Mattel and MGA are the divorced parents fighting for custody
Only a virgin wouldnt give us our extra greeting smh
Briana's friends- 💀💀💀.... Kurtis.....the *disrespect*
Loved this video, hardest I've laughed in months. Ty for making this kutis
LMAO
This is me leaving a hate comment because you disrespected Barbie 😡
haven’t watched the video yet, just wanted to say that barbie will always be superior.
You had me and my gf in fucking tears lmfao. The angry twerk skit had us crying and laughing so hard! So many of your jokes were hilarious in this video
i’ve been waiting for this my entire life
i would like this video a thousand times if i could💖
when your a monster high fan lol:)
guys kurtis does have a podcast but he's also a virgin. you're probably thinking, what's your logic? because I said so.
BRUH I WATCHED BRATZ FASHION PIXIES WHEN I WAS LITTLE IT WAS LIKE MY FAVORITE MOVIE
As a very loyal citizen of kurtistown for years, I’m very offended I didn’t get an extra greeting. #cancelkurtis 🙄😂  *also just kidding, still luv kurtis
This was my least favorite Barbie movie as a child I only liked the part when the girl almost fell in the hole. I love barbie movies a lot more however The bratz games on DS were 100% superior and the bratz movies are also memorable especially the bratz baby one
give me till payday... imma be covered in town merchh
so we just gonna pretend monster high dolls and movies aren't out there huh
I swear these movies looked way better when I was a kid- 💀
Please become bald
When I was in high school, my youngest sister was a toddler who watched both of these movies on repeat, and I gotta say, I actually kind of liked the bratz one. I mean, even having listened to it so many times I basically had it memorized, I didn't hate it. The music was honestly a bop and it had some great lines that were so ridiculous they cracked me up. I still quote it sometimes, 10+ years later. The Barbie one, on the other hand... I thought about helping it go missing more than once. Between the weasel and the kid, the level of nightmare fuel was way too high.
kurtis looks like sam from freaks and geeks and i can never unsee it now
This years Oscar’s nomination is Sughorny Weasel
That mustache is looking cleeeean. Not dirty.
Leaving a like solely for the amount of absolutely fantastic out of context clips Kurtis has provided that i will be watching in compilations later
this video cheered me up so much, genuinely laughed out loud through majority of the video, love when you do movie commentary keep it up <3
I’m at work cracking up all by myself because of “ She looks like stubbing your toe feels”. Omg it hurts 🤣
ya hooo da ba yo
Honestly? No 2nd greeting? False advertisement 😡
Okay but you have to admit barbie songs SLAP! have you heard princess and the pauper????
barbie is just more racist. i can’t elaborate on that.
A better comparison to bratz would've been barbie diaries
Yerr face has a squirrel where yerr mustache is supposed to be - An idiot farm girl probably
9:25 your bone to pick out of this scene is rapunzel's head hurting and NOT the way my mans is climbing??? SIR????
Kurtis plz im getting depression cuz i had a trash day  and i didnt get an extra greeting im contemplating suicide i dont feel special from the people who arent subbed plz pin or heart or reply with the extra greeting
Is Kirtis Garfield in a human suit? 3:41
Dear god Kurtis please watch the Polly Pocket movie I’m begging you
Definitely had a Barbie dog that had shit little plastic poops so in the barbieverse, there’s already a functioning asshole doll
Hey, just came to your video to ask why did Danny disable comments on his latest video? That was the first time I created a funny comment but couldn't post it :( P.S. nope, not going to subscribe to your channel
watch Barbie a Fashion Fairy Tale, and then Cruella 2021 and watch how Disney copied a literal ad
i support Kelly slander
No reason to subscribe anymore!
i was kinda hoping this was 30 minutes of kurtis playing with barbies and bratz dolls and making them wrestle….. maybe next time
this video was so funny for no reason gn thanks kurt
DO THE MONSTER HIGH MOVIES RN I SWEAR  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhhh
Why did he choose Barbie as Rapunzel!? It is one of the worst Barbie movies, there are so many better options. He also choose the best Bratz movie so the comparison isn’t really fair.
Wow Kurtis, Ive been a fan for over 5 years ut I swear to f-ing god that barbie movie is LEGENDARY. Wow. #cancelkurtis
kurtis looks like a white fishing dad in the suburbs
these mustache 😳🥵
Kelly better be halfway to hell by now 👍👍👍👍👍
kurtis u have no idea I literally watched the bratz movie all the time as a kid and had like dreams about it hahah
I dont know why I didn't got my extra greading. I'm considering unsubscribing
kurtis you just unlocked a memory of chalk zone that i forgot i had lmao .. thank u good sir
Kurtis u should watch the Nicolas Cage movie Willy’s Wonderland…it’s crazy
Ya hooo da va boy
High key not getting the extra greeting in Kurtis’ new video offset me so much omg I am crying
"Doth thy carpet match thy drapes?" 😭
I cry wen no extra greeting :'(
you could've picked ANY barbie movie and you chose Rapunzel? Not the nutcracker or 12 dancing princesses or fairytopia or island princess? SMH
Now do a My Scene and Monster High movie lol
ya hooo da ba yo
Hey friend, I'm Latin, hahaha, you can do the Spanish translator thanks to the good video. 😎😎😎😎😎
Kurt you've unlocked a memory.. that freaking barbie rapunzel movie omg
ya hooo da ba yo
Can't believe you didn't review the Bratz movie where they do a fashion show and a model gives them like a drug thing that make their bones cramp up arthiritis style.
The one thing I think I remember about that Bratz movie is the romance Dylan had with one of the pixie sisters.
bratz are hideous
Next watch Barbie Princess and the Pauper for Priminger
VRG stands for Verga not Virgin
As a child, I wrote a short story about Bratz that I was convinced had the same exact plot as Fashion pixies but BEFORE it came out.  I would have sworn on my grandfathers grave I was so sure. After watching your play-by-play of the movie now, I am certain I have never watched this film, and am questioning my entire reality up to this point.
The best part of Bratz is that it kind of laid the groundwork for Monster High which is superior to both Bratz and Barbie! But you and Dylan dancing thru the Bratz movie was the highlight of my day so thank you for that.  I laugh so hard it hurts when you do this shit. Not to mention I will probably forever hear "Balls" in Barbies voice and "angrily twerking" made me cry because I was laughing so hard
the no second greeting felt like a punishment :(
Not getting my extra greeting has ruined my day 😭
The mf greendale flag
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EDIT KURTIS SAYING HES A BARB!
You’re extra goofy today Kurtis 😂
Kurtis, PLEASE don't remind me of SMALL SOLDIERS!!!
pls do a video w ur canadian brother eddy v (edvasian)
Justin Bieber from No brainer
I enjoyed this very much!
“Doth thou carpets match thy drapes?”😂
12:13 got literal flashbacks to hearing the footfall sounds as a 7 year old child thinking she was seeing a cinematic masterpiece.. she was
is that jacksepticeye
I think it’s rude for Kurtis to pick one of the lamer Barbie movies, Princess and the Pauper is the superior Barbie film
kurtis owes me some damn money because "rapunzel is bald now" has just been living in my head rent-free
I feel kinda empty without that extra greeting ngl
I don't remember the animation being so bad...   I've seen a lot of the barbie movies, but I didn't even know Bratz had movies lmao
Kurtis could you put flashing warnings before anything like that RAVE
When I was little I loved Bratz Super Babyz and Bratz is so iconic and funny
CHALK ZONE <33
I got Repunzal Barbie for my birthday when I was a kid, and the graphics are wayyyyy worse than I remember lmao
bratz is animated like old final fantasy.
I mean i loved both dolls when i was a kid 🤷
i’m not one for buying youtuber merch but i’m obsessed w the cowboy sweatshirt lmao
CHALK WORLD. My childhood. XDD Gah I miss that show.
Okay whatever virgin 🙄
Omg Kurtis you have to watch "Barbie life in the dream House" it's literally so good. So funny. Like too good..
Kurtis plz talk about brats sleepover adventures bc it freaked me out as a kid.
bratz is definitely better
BOOOOO
bratz is superior
https://youtu.be/-RAglyw6ySk
i hate kelly.
Bratz was really great for girls of color especially those who lived in urban areas you can have a doll that was more like you
I’m unsubscribing because we didn’t get the extra greeting
I'm so glad at least one other person remembers Chalk Zone. The themesong still gets stuck in head sometimes.
ngl the barbie nutcracker movie sorta slaps
Pleaseeee watch a Monster High movieeeee, plssss
21:58 literal tears coming out of my eyes
I WILL UNFOLLOW AND UNSUBSCRIBE IF YOU EVER DO NOT DO THE EXTRA GREETING AGAIN. I put too much blood, sweat, and tears into liking and subscribing to get an extra greeting TO NOT GET AN EXTRA GREETING!
your most controversial video yet
No second greeting 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
10:42 I feel the menacing aura of a personal question.
2:54 I see you Kurtis with the community reference
my mom used to (jokingly) tell me and my sister Bratz were made by aliens and they were sent to earth to make us more accepting of the aliens when they finally took over the planet
Looks like what stubbing your toe feels like xD
ya hooo da ba yo
these were my two favorite movies as a kid and seeing clips from them again made me feel things i forgot i could feel
Love how he refers to the bratz girls as breeana’s friends
This was my favorite
Rly defensive about the virgin thing there buddy. 👃🏻👃🏻👃🏻
the way bratz fashion pixiez just shaped my childhood... wouldn't ask for anything else
bratz was the Barbie for poc. we felt represented with bratz and honestly they simply looked better tbh. Bratz and Barbie are incomparable, and bratz will always be better.
plS NO YOU GOTTA WATCH BARBIE MARIPOSA OR FAIRY SECRET THEYRE SO GOOD. OR EVEN FASHION FAIRY TALE OR THE THREE MUSKETEERS OR MERMAID TALE!!!!!
I still watch Bratz: A Cinderella Story once a year. That shit go hard😂
fuckin Dillon dancing to body is what I need more of plz someone make a full version
As a girl who was born in 2005 and watched both Bratz and barbie equally, I took this video personally
do i wanna be lena or be with her
I thought Small soldiers was just a childhood fever dream xD
18:43 they would burrow into your skin. No question.
Bratz only won because Kurtis didn't watch Barbie Princess & The Pauper
Only a virgin cares this much about being called a virgin, Kurtis lol  (I'm jk obviously)
Petition for Kurtis to watch Barbie and the diamond castle
Bless you
Cut the mustach
You can tell Kurtis is really struggling after making the best joke possible in the last video.
Change my mind: These movies are the direct predecessor to predatory loot boxes
He freaking looks like Justin Bieber.
am i being punished for something?!
👍
Im unsubscribing until i get an extra greeting
Hell yeah, dude. If you don’t wanna do the greeting, you don’t have to. It’s your content, and anyone who feels entitled to it (past the parameters of a joke) that’s their problem.  On another note, I still have my Bratz Christmas ornaments of the og 4, but I also have my singing Aaron Carter ornament as well, so take that as you will.
2:52 community reference?
Honestly worst barbie film (imo) should've watched Barbie Nutcracker...I acknowledge my bias
Yall just like bratz cuz its trendy, just a fact
This is fucking fantastic video as always
That was definitely the worst Barbie movie
Bruh this video and editing was amazing
Ur #2 on trending my guy 👏👏👏
I honestly am happy you are considering dropping the extra greeting. It was nice at first but it definitely seemed like you were forcing yourself to say it as of late. You should do what's best for you Kurt boy!
Kurtis idk if anyone has mentioned this, but you said $5000 and then you said $500, so yeah, you did a mess up! I caught yoouuu!! Haha!! Fishy fishy fishy, makin it stinky!
my mom never let me play with Bratz so i always had barbies. i have such an attachment to the barbie movies so they’ll always be the best in my heart
I swear if Barbie as Rapunzel gets a live action...we need Cate Blanchett as Gothel.......SHE'LL BE PERFECT AS HER WITH THE SIMILAR FACE STRUCTURE AND SAUCY VOICE YES 💖💖💖
kurtis imitating the brat dances should not this funny, but i just finished crying bcs i was laughing so hard-
No one ever remembers chalk zone! I thought it was a Mandela effect fever dream...
Okq
Kurtis’ moustache was rated 100% on rotten tomatoes
Kurtis's dancing gives me life
*I hope you get a lot of shit for purposely not giving the extra greeting*
21:57
The ultimate crime was not including Monster High into this doll movie comparison smh
Kurtis shave👺
My fight or flight responses kicked in when I heard Kurtis say my name 💀
bi kur
kurtis, why do i always get vape ads when i watch your videos ?
Out of all the Barbie movies....you picked the best.  P.S. I want to name my kid after the purple dragon👀
fun fact Bratz was created by a Jewish man and Yasmin is modeled after his own daughter <3
PLS DO MONSTER HIGH NEXT
I loved Barbie movies so much growing up because in the older ones Barbie's character would inspire me to be kind and a better person, at least for a kid lol I found it that way. Also it gave me an appreciation for classical music, especially in Swan Lake.
He fr on number 2 trending
ok I was literally obsessed with the barbie movie as a kid and it's so funny seeing how bad the quality is now 😭 like those blank green hills? those footstep sounds? iconic
I felt like we were holding you hostage with that opener you always do so I’m glad you didn’t do it this time haha
ya hoooo da ba yo
legend has it: hisoka and that weasel have the same voice actor
that bratz movie scared me as a kid😹 dylan was creepy af
i want a full version of "do i wanna gnome" and i want it NOW
should’ve watched barbie and the twelve dancing princesses, that one slaps
That barbie as Rapunzel movie made me grow my hair out as long as it is 💀 like, 5yo bi me was like: 👁👄👁<(i wan.)
#2 on trending!!!! Let’s goooooooo Sheriff Kurt!!!!!
Thank you Kurtis, for reminding me of the horrible fanfic I read ages ago with Hedwig and another HP character 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 I will never stop being haunted by that disgusting fanfic.
Okay but Penelope wasn't good at flying at the beginning of the film and wouldn't have been able to fly her down. But after she's gained her confidence at the end and has some experience under her belt, she can get Rapunzel out of the tower. That's character growth ✋
Is it just me, or does the barbie dragon look like spyro-
kurtis i’m really thinking about signing up for current but i wanna know what the back of the cards look like :( you should dm me the back of yours so i have an idea of what mine would look like
Sooo, as an only child, I played a lot with Barbies by myself. When I was probably 6, I heard a song by the Barenaked Ladies on the radio, with the radio DJ announcing the name of the band. My little 6 year old brain took their band name literally, and got confused as to how they would be allowed to perform in concert as naked ladies! I then decided to reenact (what I imagined to be) a Barenaked Ladies concert with my Barbies, unclothed, in front of an audience of other Barbie dolls (and a couple of Power Rangers).... my mom then walked into my room MORTIFIED, and promptly told me to put the clothes back on my dolls.
OMG I always thought it might've been virgin LOL or Virgo maybe for some reason, I've been so curious all these years but I never connected it to the podcast!
sad I didn't get an extra greeting but I forgive u kurt
Who’s gonna tell Kurtis that Hedwig was a female owl? 💀
I was promised an extra greeting with every video....i guess it's time to unsub...
I have a book about Barbie as Rapunzel that I got as a kid. It consists dolls designed to look like scenes from the movie with a summary of the movie. It’s chalk-full of spelling and grammar mistakes. The worst part is that they made a second edition to the book after the one I own.
Dafuq i had a barbie ad before watching this video
no extra greeting. wow i might aswell unsub if this is the treatment we will get! (jk, keep doing you)
Barbie movies and the bratz ps2 games were and still are elite
Sooo let me get this straight…you’re saying that kurtis town is the place to live, with Greg as your army? Nice 👌
woc are sexualized at such a young age, thats probably partially why bratz were seen as sexualized. young black girls are seen as less innocent and more mature than their peers which leads to being hypersexualized. i know in my (white) family bratz weren't allowed because of their big lips being "suggestive" which is just... bad? it is so bad. the sexualization of woc goes back to even before the civil war in the very early stages of black slavery in the americas and it was used in a large way to justify how they were treated and ideas from those times are still prevalent in our society today
yoooo #2 on trending pog
Let’s all be adults and recognize that if Kurtis had watched the 12 Dancing Princesses movie Barbie would’ve won this
i didnt know jacksepticeye was in Bratz
I demand a revisit to the Barbie movies Kurtis. This is Bibble and Preminger erasure https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4BWpwdrIIs
kelly is my new sleep paralysis demon lol
the sound i made when i saw Barbie as Rapunzel pop up on screen was ungodly! thank you papa Kurtis, i feel seen, heard, honoured and acknowledged for my childhood fav  Edit: never mind, I'm an orphan now 😤😤

*raPUNZEL is BALD NOW* and *dO i waNnA gNoMe?* are two of my favorite things kurtis has ever said now
"Doth thy carpets match your drapes" lowkey reminded me of the one scene in the Avengers move "Doth mother know you weareth her drapes" ik the first one is referring to pubic hair but yea
"Assing me" -Kurtis Conner 2021 4:12
I cant even comment on the content of this video...You said Joe dirt (on VRG or here), and now that is all I can see! DAMN YOU KURTIS!

I was expecting the Wilhelm scream to play everytime the name was mentioned...

https://youtu.be/XG_WTGEXD8Q
Please watch Barbie Fashion Fairytale. It's BY FAR the best Barbie movie.
The music is distracting
Dylan is my love
Bratz 100%!!!
a big reason why people love barbie movies is because of the songs
YOU REALLY THINK U CAN GET AWAY WITH NO EXTRA GREETING
Yall talk about bratz dolls and barbie dolls, but sleep on monster high dolls😪
Kurtis did you shave your head for that bit?  I must know.
John 3:16-18 For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through Him might be saved. He that believes in Him is not condemned: but he that does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
ok who the FUCK unsubscribed me from this channel the literal day after i spent $100 on his merch. I’M throwing hands.
The fact that u told us to get water right after I had left to look for it lol
* God's grace *  Did you know that God loves you so much that he sent Jesus to save us? Jesus is the son of God! And he loves you very much! To have proof of this, we can say that he emptied himself of all his glory and stepped on the earth! Isn't that wonderful? And there's more! He assured us of salvation! He fulfilled the mission that God gave him! Which is to have a death on the cross for all people in the world! * How do I get to heaven? * It's very simple! -Accept Jesus as your Lord and only Savior! - Repent of your sins daily even those you don't know because you sinned out of ignorance! -Recognize that you do not deserve God's salvation but even with your faults He wanted to save you with his great love and grace! Now about keeping your faith -Read the Bible daily -Pray and fast -Go to a church that follows the word of God  May God bless you greatly! 👋
Woodchipper? I hardly know er
Quentin Tarantino was ROBBED at the horniest weasel nomination😤
When Kurtis purposely didn't do a extra greeting 🥺😔🔪
Kurtis please bring back the "please be nice to me" hat I missed my chance it's the merch my heart desires
You should watch bratz diamondz forever. That shit slaps😩
22:19 furiously twerking
Didn't have any competition? Sindy: Am I a joke to you
We will always stan bratz. 😍
Jesus is King. Jesus Christ was crucified for our sins so we can have a chance to make it to the where the path of righteousness leads (heaven/eternal life). I highly suggest you repent and take the Gift! 🕊🎁✨

Bald rapunzel kurtis looks a bit toooo much like Jesse from breaking bad
I refuse to put two queens against each other XD But I will watch and like the video :)  Edit: Holy shit! #2 on trending! Good job, Kurtis!
Dudeeeeeee your scores are fucked up! and it's because you didn't watch them as a kid when they JUST came out  smh :( Barbie's movies were all the rage back then 10/10 , I used to watch them with my friends at sleepovers and stuff, we only watched Bratz movies on tv after school cause it was on....
Please do more of these 😭😭 this was amazing 🤣😍
Kurtis: This is just not realistic okay.  Me: None of this ever was Kurtis.
The way he only calls them "briyannas friends" is so fucking funny seeing as they're the main characters of the movies and the franchise itself
honestly heartbroken that i didnt get the extra greeting :'(
#2 on trending good job my boi
This is my scene doll erasure
<3
Dear Kurtis. On your Disney Adults video, I left a comment thanking you for the extra greetings. I've been deeply hurt by the lack of the extra greeting, but I understand your reasoning. Have a nice day.
Before you mentioned Chalk Zone, I was thinking about the Rapunzel episode of Chalk Zone...wow life is crazy
I grew up with Barbie. Bratz never appeal me. Maybe it's because of their fish mouths since I hated them
some of my favorite barbie movies growing up: Mermaidia, Fairytopia, Thumbelina, Mariposa, Christmas Carol.  Also Kurtis, you're Canadian, have you ever watched Braceface or What's with Andy? They used to air these shows dubbed in Romanian in my country but they marked my childhood.
Dude you picked like the worst barbie movie ever...
The Kelly Slander…. Pleaseeee 😭😭😭
https://youtu.be/xUpR4uCqqeE
ya hooo da ba yo🦘👒👅
Extra greeting?🤨
Off topic I have that globe in the background
Imo you go to Barbie for the movies and go to Bratz for the dolls. Bratz always just seemed so much more fashionable while Barbie was and still is safe.
"Dillon walked so E Boy's could run their fingers through their hair"...I AM DECEASED!!
Bratz will always be better… I’m glad i grew up with dolls who actually looked similar to me
justice for my scene dolls 😔
i am somehow more offended by the conscious lack of extra greeting lol
bratz was so funny to me when I was younger and 8 years still funny asf
Feeling cheated Curtis how could you. I didn't subscribe just for the hell of it dammit!
YESSS TRENDINGGG WTFF
what did i subscribe for if you're not doing the extra greeting, kurtis.
ya hooo da ba yo kurtis
"Do thou carpets match thy drapes?" man fuck you for that 😂
“Could a virgin have a podcast?”  Me *sweats while looking at Ben Shapiro*
tbh the merch is nice... i don't have the money for it but it's nice
petition for Kurtis to cover a monster high movie next
Penelope is THE BEST part of Barbie as Rapunzel and no one can tell me otherwise.
dude both movies look  like a bad ps2 game
headwig is a girl
https://youtube.com/channel/UCTIwuDM-J8EZvMRWmzZUHXQ
Barbie movies are iconic but you have to admit the Bratz Albums were *chef's kiss*
#2 on trending nice
BRATZ PIXIES WAS MY FAVORITE MOVIE AS A KID. I still want a party as lit as the dark pixies had :(
Loved the Barbie movies and the bratz dolls had better fashion, but Myscene?!? Hands down best website, I would spend hours on that
This is not your fight Kurtis…
Literally my new favorite video from you
Bald Kurtis will be in my nightmares tonight.
The fact that Kurtis made #2 on trending makes my heart so fucking happy
What movie is at the chase scene no music (12:41)?
KURTIS I UNSUBSCRIBED HOW DARE YOU CHOOSE NOT TO GIVE ME AN EXTRA GREETING
Do I wanna gnome? If this feeling flows both ways (Sad to see you gnome) was sorta hopin’ that you’d stay (Baby we both gnome) that the nights were mainly made  For sayin’ things that you can’t say tomorrow day.
I had no idea how much I needed this video, thank you Kurtis
I used to watch this one bratz baby movie where they where in a mall :)
i always thought the letters stood for virgo (i’m a virgo)
24:55 am I the only one who hears "a huja jebano"
the fact is bratz got shamed because they highlighted features that many bipoc - particularly Black women - have that white media considered “sexual”. as for “showing more skin”, that was literally just the fashion at the time. barbie had it too. fundamentally, barbie and bratz are the same; one just doesn’t cater to typically eurocentric features.
Barbie Nutcracker was always my favorite growing up. Now I’m wondering if it’s as good as I remember
Kurtis I can’t believe you left out the bit where Dylan sings that song and finishes it with “greetings ma ladies” that is obviously the best part of the entire movie
CHALK ZONE
Okay, I got a little freaked out a bit because Kurtis and I ajusted ourselves in our chairs the same exact way at the same exact time at 6:56.....
You should watch Barbie princess charm school it was my favourite Barbie movie as a kid
The bratz pack? No, “briana’s friends”😌
#2 on trending lets goo
BUT DAAAAAD YOU DIDNT MAKE ME FEEL SPECIAL AND NOW I HAVE NO REASON TO BE SUBSCRIIIIIBED.
https://youtu.be/C9QvsyWr-9o
Why the fuck did you say bursted what the hell
Yo pensé que vrg era verga JSJAJJAJAJAJAJAJA
ya hoo da ba yo
Whyd he choose the worst fuckin barbie movie😭 diamond castle was RIGHT THERE
the dancing scenes have absolutely NO right to be so funny. I can’t stop laughing.
Wow these movies were really animated like a cutscene on a gamecube game huh? especially the bratz one
Sir I am literally BEGGING you to review “Barbie and the Diamond Castle”, I personally think it is the gayest Barbie movie and everyone needs to know.
“Little British rabbit friend named Hobi” Me: Hoseok? 😂
I swear the graphics were much better when I watched Barbie as a kid...
Anyone else mad that he chose this Barbie movie?  He needs to watch more of a classic
Bratz>>>
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17-For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
Bratz games were better. Barbie on gameboy were tall women flippin on screen. Bratz games were highly stimulating and full of puzzles. Bratz had better hair in general too
I would watch a whole video series of Kurtis retelling fairy tales…
bratz boys and girls looking like gen z on tiktok 100%
YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME AN EXTRA GREETING HOW DARE YOU I SUBSCRIBED FOR THIS REASON AND THIS REASON ONLY
The fact he likes the Bratz I LOVE HIM
Is NO ONE going to comment on the James Charles “holding myself accountable”
Not giving an extra greeting at the beginning of every single video seems like something only a virgin would do
And what did we learn in this video?   *b a l l s*
banger vid bruh
liked the vid at "do i wanna gnooOome"
Bro small soldiers was the GOAT. Love that movie. Very sad tho.
kurtis showing clips of the barbie movie made me remember so many deeply buried childhood memories
11:22 looks like me!  :D
K but the actual animation of the brats character ps are pretty good the scenery could be better
should have done bratz rock angels and barbie swan lake frfrfr those were wack and fun
Okay but next can you pls watch Hot Wheels World Race
I wish he woulda reviewed the bratz movie about the truth serum lol
I'm sorry, IS NO ONE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE ANGRY TWERKING??? Took a sip of my drink just before his angry twerking face popped up and I almost choked to death 💀 Something about the mustache just made it extra hilarious
Animals in Barbie Movies 👁👄👁💅🏻 Nevermind, that weasel... *ughhh 💦*
I liked brats more than barbie as a kid my favorite was Yasmin my favorite movie of there's was the two baby ones 👌🏽
The weasel has a little weasel in his pants
18:44 Loved the reference Kurt
also i haven’t laughed this hard in a video in so long so THANK U
Does anyone else think that Kurtis kinda looks like the weasel? (I’m so sorry Kurtis pls don’t kick me out of kurtistown)
Kuris looks like Justin Bieber
when johnny lies to papa 22:13
*"OH DIOS MÍO"* *"esto es lo que necesitas"* *"**FF6.lifE**"* *"No hay límites aquí, ¿verdad?"* "完璧"
kurtis, bestie, please comb ur mustache😟😟😟😟😟
The bratz movie was my favorite movie of all time (besides baby bratz) as a kid
ya hooo da ba yo
that weasel's next level, why did they think this was appropriate oh my fcking god
Okay, but you should see Barbie: life in the dreamhouse. It was hilarious
7:52 WTF WHY IS HER WAIST SO FUCKING SMALL
This episode had me crying laughing at 3am
make this a series, kurt✊🏻
“I’m not gonna do the one thing that will easily solve all my problems until I absolutely have to”  I mean, that is way more relatable than you think, Kurtis
19:37 lollll am deaddd
Random observation but the weasel kind of looks like Kurtis's moustache
had a feeling you were getting tired of the extra greeting :(
Barbie as rapunzel is incredible thank you for choosing this one
bratz: super babiez is one of my favorite movies ever. my cousin, younger sister n i used to watch it every time we hung out
For movies: Barbie As dolls: Bratz
Wasn't Penelope afraid of heights? Am I remembering it wrong?
he needs to watch the bratz kids my first sleepover movie…literally a fever dream
kurtis finally making a video on barbie???? THE HEAVENS HAVE ANSWERED MY CRIES LETS GOOOOOO
The fact that I owned both of these movies on dvd 🥲🤚
But the real question is how do these stand up to the monster high movies 🤔
kurtis, i was a barbie fanatic  watch charm school PLEASE
If only Kurtis would play the Barbie computer and Nintendo games. . .
Why am I subscribed if not for an extra greeting then???  -.-
I’m not gonna accept the claims of this video until he watches Princess and the Pauper
Kurtis have u tried to be a princess? 🤔
My dumbass read "Barbie vs. Barbz" and I still clicked on the video 🏃
sorry kurtis cant get through the rest of the video without my extra greeting 😔
Kurtis misgendering hedwig??? During pride month???
18:59 is no one going to talk about how it says James Charles as the channel name and how there were more dislikes than likes ? 😂
congrats on being #2 on trending my guy
I looooved that Barbie movie as a kid!
I will unsubscribe if I don't receive my next extra greeting
"Do I wanna Gnome?" Joke made me laugh so hard XD I'm crying 🤣🤣
I feel pandered to and I’m OK with that! 💜
I hope Kurtis didn’t forget that Rapunzel from that one Shrek movie is actually bald
I CALL FOUL, YOU SHOULD'VE WATCHED THE PRINCESS AND THE PAUPERRRRRR!!!!!
I remember watching the shit out of Barbie movies at some point to manage my anxiety. Worked
Dyllan walked so e-boys could run their fingers through their hair is the best sentence ever
Dude. Barbie was my childhood.😂
Angry, twerking, mustache Kurtis!!
Idk if he's a virgin or not but I would be concerned to 69 that mustache...
Can’t wait for the rule34 art on the weasel
Sometimes Kurtis’s videos make me actually lmao. The whole time I’ve been on the toilet cracking tf up
Bratz fashion pixies is an elite film and no one will change my mind on that
No….extra….greeting…. My day genuinely got a little bit worse cuz of this 🥲
Lmao Kurtis calling the Bratz “Brianna’s friends”. He should’ve watched the first movie so he can see how they got their name
monster high le gana
dude you should’ve watched Bratz Rock Angelz or Pretty in Punk
Haha do I wAaanna GnOoome
I’m pissed where’s my extra greeting
you should have watched the princess and the pauper instead! the most iconic and the best of the barbie movies. ALSO there’s this subplot in rapunzel where penelope (the dragon) is afraid of flying high and has to over come that. so that’s why she couldn’t save rapunzel herself. that detail must have just been cut to make a joke :/
Okay This has to be said. I was going to join current because I am incredibly poor and I really need the money, even if there is just a slim chance of me getting it. I checked out the app and the reviews are HORRIBLE. So so SO many people are reporting scamming and nothing is done, people cannot contact customer support and are basically told to fuck off when they have a problem. People are locked out of their accounts and not being helped, and it overall seems like people are LOSING money over current.  I would seriously advise anyone in my situation not to join current, or link anything to it, as there seems to be a high volume of scamming going on and many people just cannot afford to lose anymore money during this pandemic.
The best dolls were monster high 😎
Nah you did Barbie dirty, the movie you should have watched is Barbie and the 12 dancing princesses. Also, the soundtrack on that movie is FIRE
Kurtis was vibin’ with that Bratz music though 💀
This is the most chaotic video I’ve ever seen and it’s manly because the mustache
why economy crisis form America?
I hate to unsubscribe from you because you make some good content but damn I did not sign up for barbie vs brats. Please change. Thanks.
petition for kurtis to watch bratz go to paris
there's a huge difference between $5000 and $500 which one are you giving away
growing up bratz was my favorite dolls but barbie’s movies were better. up until i was like 10 i watched every movie [that was out at the time] my favorites were barbie in the nutcracker, princess and the pauper, barbie magic of pegasus, and the fairytopia trilogy.  [edit]: kurtis, penelope is afraid of flying 😭 that’s why hoby and penelope didn’t know what to do or how to get up there😭
This is trending at #2 in my country ??? I've never seen one of his on the trending pages HAHA
The barbie movies are superior and this is coming from someone who watched both types of movies as a kid and owned both kinds of dolls. There's a reason as to why I still watch the barbie movies but not the Bratz ones
Around the 9 minute mark, Kurtis called Hedwig a he but Hedwig is a she.
Okay but why did he pick the only Barbie movie I didn't like as a child. The mermaid one slaps. The fairy one slaps. The weird 12 Dancing Princesses one, slaps. The Princess and the Pauper SLAPS!
Why did that gnome have a really good Irish accent. Like normally they’re shit but that felt too real Jesus Christ.
Unlocked memory: chalk zone
Me growing up with Monster High gals:
The fact that I could remember the bratz movie in its entirety scares me
Okay now monster high lmao
Bald Kurtis earns a like.
Number 2 on trending
I have such a hard time watching Kurtis' videos while eating bc i keep snorting and I'm having a terrible good time
Omg I remember watching bratz super babyz and it absolutely traumatized me as a kid because the aliens were so fucking scary
Bratz > Barbie. Fight me. I dropped my Barbies for Bratz and my mom and I scoured EVERYWHERE for them. Picked up a bratz T-shirt for some nostalgia the other day and I’m 28 😂 we are the girls with a passion for fashion!
What's weird is that Bratz had bowls. Like, typical bowls that you eat out of.
I BEEN DONE KNEW KURTIS WAS BRATZ NAYSH DUDE!
Barbie movies best Bratz dolls best
I think the wig Kurtis used for the Rapunzel sketch was the same wig drew used for his Kim possible sketch
Kurtis is the only person that I can watch while I walk around my house in the dark at 3AM without being scared lmao
Usually after a video like this making fun of something that I really have an emotional connection to, I would feel a little bit sad even if it was silly. But kurtis is just so genuinely funny and lighthearted about his critiques, I always feel like he's laughing with me instead of at me.
The bratz sleepover was the best one
hahaha virgin
Shut up, bratz for life
Barbie couldn't escape before because Penelope was always too afraid to fly
✨balls✨
*sees the weasel:* Oh.     It's this one.
At the moment, you are #2 on trending
Thumbnail is makeup back in 2010 vs makeup now on insta
Bro, did you just whip out the Wendy Williams fart?
perioddd rapunzel is THE best barbie movie
bless you
omg jshdisfksn - barbie rapunzel was my favorite barbie movie
16:22 that award would most definitely go to tarantino 😭
~ do I wanna gnome~  *immediate regret*
But u should've watched good movies like barbie mermadia
kurtis watch willy’s wonderland
"I'm not a virgin" *proceeds to laugh at the word "balls"*
please this needs to be a series PLEASE
I was obsessed with penelope
the fact you didn't choose bratz rock angels proves ur a virgin
do I wanna GNOME? *takes a second and then just starts laughing hysterically... then feels like I need to apologize to someone*
Kurtis’ search history must confuse Google so much
Number 2 on trending, NICE!
how could you not mention dilf hugo the dragon??
Bratz Babies movies were so superior
GO BEST FRIEND
KURTIS ON TRENDING OKAY
i didnt get my extra greeting, im unsubbing rn smh my head cant believe u kurtis
The Bratz are better. I’m not arguing with no one.
You look like Justin Bieber
i’m very upset about missing my extra greeting
Fashion 4 passion is the most iconic bratz movie
The emo/goth representation in Bratz is legendary 🖤🌙🔮🥀
If you’re curious about Rapunzel lifting ppl with her hair, the youtube channel "As/Is" made a video litteraly called "I tried lifting a person with hair like Rapunzel", where they show and explain how that would be possible in real life 👍
Sir, it looks like you ripped your hair and mustache off a Friday The 13th movie   And that is not an insult is any way shape or form it looks amazing
maTELL ME THAT
Kurtis I need you to review more Barbie movies plz
I love that mems are unlocked every time I watch your channel
7:50 just goes to show how tiny Barbie"s waist is if two hands can wrap around it like that. Yikes.
Did- did Kurtis just purposely skip the extra greeting... and no one even mentioned it....
The fact that he did a Barbie movie and that movie was not the princess and the pauper? Shameful kurtis. Shameful.
yall called him a virgin and he revoked our extra greeting privilege
One thing I appreciate that Bratz did Is they made a doll for a disabled black trans women who is a model named Aaron Rose Philp https://twitter.com/aaronphilipxo/status/1370152813716779011?s=19
I ADORED Barbie, my mom collected them and then let me play with them bUT BRATZ CAME OUT and they were just wayyyyy cooler but Barbie has better movies, the only good Bratz movie was passion 4 fashion diamondz😌✨
Oh🙃 allow😅 me🤗 mistress🥰 MMMMMMmMMmMMmM😫
Oh thank god this was my favourite bratz movie
I remember when my mom was giving birth to my sister, my grandpa took me to the store to get me a doll, and I asked for the Sasha Bratz doll bc she was my favorite, and he said “no you don’t need the black one” lmao WHAT
dude i rarely audibly laugh from a youtube vid. this is the only channel that can make me do that
Kurt boy really outdid himself this time
kelly has to go
Dude ur funneh
Why was the gnome Irish and used Irish language words and Irish phrases......?
Honestly as an Irish person that gnome acted exactly like every single old man I know
Best Barbie movie: 12 Dancing Princesses Best Bratz movie: Bratz: Passion 4 Fashion - Diamondz  Only the Bratz movie is entertaining for adults too though. Overall, Bratz will always be my fave!
Kurtis I´m sorry but Barbie is OG. Swan Lake? Immaculate. The Princess and the Pauper? Amazing. And don´t even start me on Mariposa omg
DOTH THY CARPETS MATCH THY DRAPES 💀
18:58 Lmao o o oOO OOO O
that gave me flash back on W. I. T.C.H. and the Winx Club lol.
i swear to god, no matter which bratz film, game, or book it is *dylan is always fucking there*
Yes kurtis,  everyone remembers chalk zone 🤣 i have the theme song on my daily mix playlist 😎
KURTISSS PLEASE WATCH ALL BARBIE MOVIES
barbie is like yea but bratz is more yuh
I happen to be doing a project for uni exactly on this topic. I guess great minds think alike  hehehe
eww for the love of god, shave yourself
#2 on trending!!
Kelly's forehead is relatable, my mom always told me I would grow into it, but I still have space to project a film on my face lmao
Barbie just slaps harder. You need to watch the fairytopia where she goes to mermaidia. Bibble is where it's at.
Love your artic monkeys cover kurtis
Dang think I gotta unsubscribe because I didn't get that extra greeting
That Monday joke was such a millennial thing to say  LOL
ok but have you seen the princess and the pauper barbie movie? bc that movie was my childhood, it was flawless idc what anyone says
Dude, SHE'S A PIXIE! What else do you need to know?
Your skits are making me crack up so hard 😭 ✨ "Do I WaNNa GnOme"✨ just hits different Nevermind I love them all equally
15:20 I used to work at a piñata factory, until it went bust
giving barbie a 4/10 during pride month?? homophobic. im disappointed in you kurtis:(
various rainbows goose
this is so surreal to me bc bratz fashion pixies is something my sister and i thought we were the only ones who knew about it, we always reference it and i rewatched it last year lol
DISLIKE NO EXTRA GREETING
The barbie horse game was the first game I neglected real life for, I would probably still spend hours playing it and trying to get a 100% completion
You chose the worst Barbie movie
Let Kurtis leave the extra greeting behind, y'all
No, I loved that brats movie.  It was my favorite growing up.
Bratz was personally better to me. I don't like barbie, she was very basic, Bratz I could honestly relate to more with fashion and the diversity was awesome
#2 on trending!!!! 😳🔪
Twerk on your enemies
i was gonna talk on like my opinion but i literally cant because i want to be a bratz doll LMAOFNSKG. also it’d be so cool if you talked about monster high!
Oh boy. The design of bratz works fine as dolls but it Does Not Translate Well into 3D animation.
#2 on Trending
I was beginning to think I was the only person who watched Chalk Zone ✌💖🤙
Kurtis pls, WATCH BRATZ SLEEPOVER ADVENTURE  U just opened a door u can’t close dude 🙄
can kurtis pleassseeee rank the barbie movies I will pay so much money for kurtis to watch 12 dancing princesses and princess and the pauper
But you picked the wrong Bratz movie!!! Bratz rock angels is where it is!!!!!
0:30 THAT IT!!!!😞😠🤬😩😣😡😤🤬👿😫😡😤🤬😈!!!!! I'm fucking unsubing, now who is in control!!!😈🤬🤡🥳🤪😇🥰 ☠💀🤡Mr. Virgin💀☠🤡
A vrg would say they aren't a vrg though
growing up on the old barbie movies is a flex
the "i am not what i create" with the funky music has the strongest bo burnham energy of anything kurtis has ever created
11:00 6:02            mm~ ahh~ 😩😩
the fact today's kids probably don't even know/ rember Bratz. Or the hype that was about them but than it just fade away
Didn’t give us an extra greeting and got trending? Coincidence I think not!
how dare he not do an extra greeting
MATEL ME THAT
Review Review barbie movies🔫
*angry twerking*
so no ones going to talk about skipping the extra greeting???
I FORGOT. as always, my reccommendation is Leo the Lion (2013) if youre bored and dont want to feel sober. best watched with friends :}
"I think I might just hate kids" Same Kurtis, same.
You look like new kids
iv always liked bratz more, i thought they were prettier with better clothes, but my mom bought me more barbie because she was one of the parents who thought they were harmful :( but bratz just felt more unique unlike barbie. and your video just made me realize i watch that bratz movie. wow that just unlocked a part of my memory
What's the purpose of being subscribed without an extra greeting?
I never felt insecure with my dolls growing up. Mostly because I kept losing the arms to my monster high dolls
Welcome to another episode of “I don’t understand why on earth YouTube recommended me this but I don’t regret it and it’s made my day better”
I still love dolls and still watch Bratz, monster high, and barbie movies even if I wasn't into the barbie dolls. I can't express how much I love this video and how happy I am I could cry lol
i can make u change ur mind about barbie movies: watch princess and the pauper
I’m a Barbie head & I’m pissed. Swan lake????? The nutcracker??????? 12 DANCING PRINCESSES????????? I’m sry, just passionate
This is monster high erasure and I will not stand for it. Kurtis I declare you as my mortal enemy from this day forth. Consider this a warning.
baby PLEASE shave the stache 😭
i swear to fucking god he has a different hair style every video
Wait does this mean there’s a possibility he might react to Barbie’s Life in the Dream House? Raquelle and Ryan possible recognition finally? 👀
I love your stache and mullet
*angry twerking*
Love how you used the community flag lol
I hope Kurtis review more of these films or even make a series about it
Brats are the best
Barbie taught me how to be a nice person, Bratz taught me how to be a bad bitch. Both taught me fashion ✨
Kurtis is #2 on trending while i'm hyperfixating on him, this was meant to be, also so proud lol
I'm still gonna watch without the intro but I'm not gonna smile >:(
Pls more Bratz videos they were the serotonin of my childhood and you are the serotonin of my adulthood
Please make these a regular occurring series on your channel!
i know a lot of people love it but barbie as rapunzel is probably one of my least favorite barbie movies (i dont hate it, i just would rather watch other ones) I feel like he would've liked another barbie movie better
Now why did the lack of extra greeting hurt my feelings :/
i love how disappointed in himself he is on half the jokes he makes
Kurtis is a big vrg
25:30 “I don’t have any daughters”   Me: “yeah, I know :)”
UNBELIEVEBLE!!!! I JUST SUBSCRIBED TO YOU CAUSE I WANTED TO HAVE THIS EXTRA GREETING AND NOW YOU HAVE THE AUDACITY TO JUST DENY ME MY RIGHT!!!! JUST TO LET YOU KNOW I DISLIKED THIS VIDEO AND TO PUT MAKE THIS WORSE I LIKED ALL VIDEOS WITH AN EXTRA GREETING AFTERWARDS!!!  #cancelkurtisconneragain
28:48 bless you
Bratz are way worse. Barbie was tolerable. Bratz however… I remember those mid 2000’s adds of the dolls. The most defining feature I think was their huge glittery kissy lips. As a guy, I wanted to throw up every time a commercial came on. I lost my appetite so much when eating breakfast. SATANIC GLITTER DOES NOT BELONG ON OVERLY MASSIVE KISSY LIPS! Ugh!
✨"Pega ele, frita ele, faz purê."✨  Thank you, brazilian dubbing.
pitting two queens against each other kurtis smh
Omg but Bratz rock angels was THE bratz movie, the songs slap so hard too
this video just made me remember the crush i had on Penelope's father...
Bratz > Barbie no cap
kurtis you literally picked one of the worst movies to watch. princess and the pauper as some BANGER songs and princess charm school Is literally a masterpiece.
BRATZ!!
monster high movies next kurtboy 😃
bratz fashion pixiez was about drugs
my man kurt i am feeling under appreciated without my second greeting
8:26 is that the bell from dark souls after you kill the gargoyle or do I just play way too much dark souls?
give us back the extra greeting you fascist!!
i'm SO HAPPY the extra greeting is gone, stay strong hugo
Hedwig is female, Kurtis ):
Extra greetings are overrated anyways. 🙄
You’re doing Otto the otter such a disservice by calling him a weasel, he’s an icon
Y’all ever play the Barbie as Rapunzel computer game?? Shit slapped
kurtis u have to watch barbie life in the dreamhouse
Can’t believe i watched a YouTube video recalling shit I thought was iconic as a child (highkey would still watch these now)
You forgot about monster high that shit was pooooooooopular
My parents banned Bratz dolls cause my dad thought they would turn me and my sisters into brats…
why did him skipping the extra greeting actually hurt me
I really appreciate how Kurtis caters to his audience.  The only man I would listen talk about Barbie / Bratz. The girls love you Kurty boy
12:20 why does he look like chucky 💀
rapunzel was a BANGER
are we NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW HE SKIPPED OUT ON THE EXTRA GREETING???
BRATZ SUPER BABIES. It’s like a terrible mix of Goat Story 2 and those freaky Superbabies movies
More like Very Really Gvirgin. Haha, good one, self.
At this point, I give Barbie the points for having almost every male love interest in the movies be voiced by the same guy who voiced L in the Death Note dub
Do I wanna gnome…if this feeling goes both ways.
My friends and I once binged like eight of the Barbie movies and they honestly hit different so I'm team Barbie, that being said the entire Bratzilla spinoff series was my shit to the end
Honestly even tho everyone loves the Barbie movies I always found them boring even as a kid. The Bratz movies can be WILD but I think that's what's so fun about them. My favourite was about Bratz defeating alien potatos lmao
I feel like this video just kept getting better as it went on
I was hoping he would talk about the bratz movie startin and stylin
#cancelkurtisconner2021
Both are iconic periodt
a great video and i've always loved bratz more ngl, but in Barbie Rapunzel, they literally tell you the reason the dragon doesn't fly barbie outta the tower. Its cuz Penelope's scared of heights and can't get her over the magic wall and even if she could her dad is currently enslaved by Gothel! So obvi she doesn't want Gothel to lash out at her father because of her helping out Barbie.
anyone else remember the Bratz Baby movie with the weird potato aliens
2:50   Tbh this could probably be a real product, considering all the dolls about pooping these days
U WATCHED THE WORST BARBIE MOVIE NO
Unsubscribed. The only reason I subbed was for the extra greeting
3:08 Mattel actually released Christie O'Neill back in 1968 so they were already "trying" to be inclusive but of course they didn't give her enough spotlight (whatsoever)
ya hoo da ba yo
Bratz babies is arguably one of the best movies
Says he gets a lot of action and is not a virgin them proceeds to talk about action figures need I say more...
I want more barbie related content, thank you 🤗
I need to hear his opinion of Barbie princess and the pauper. Its unironically one of my favorite movies.
Good I was getting tired of that extra greeting 😈😈😈😈
The fact that the official Bratz account linked to this video is SURREAL
8:23 i laughed way too hard at that bell
dude the bratz movie is so much funnier than the barbie one holy shit
good balls joke kurtis :)
Wow https://discord.gg/kK73SFAg
Ok so I just wanna say that her hair was tied to the pillar next to her so when he pulls up on the hair he’s not yanking her head everytime 😂
The parts where Kurtis hates on children 🤣 4:52  7:18 12:20  14:22
😡 This is outrageous, who's going to provide the supplemental "hi hello it's great to see you again" I am entitled to now?!!?!  /j BTW, love that transition slide. 👍
ok now watch monster high movies next
best dolls? bratz  best movies? barbie
Love how the evil pixies are just,,,, goths
I see your Barbie Vs. Bratz and raise you   Monster high 😎
The Bratz fashion was like ahead of our time. We dress like them now.
Bratz is BRUTAL
dylan is literally a bratz levi ackerman holy shit also him twerking holy shit that’s hilarious
ya hoo da ba yo
Is nobody else sad about the extra greeting
The only reason I didn't like Bratz because they had no noses
KURTIS ITS CRIMINAL THAT YOU DIDNT CHOSE BRATZ ROCK ANGELS AS THE BRATZ MOVIE ITS THE ABSOLUTE BEST BRATZ MOVIE ✨SIMPLY A MASTERPIECE✨
"mattel me that"  "so no headwig" "y2k?"   you've been popping off with these jokes lately
Bratz: teaches you to be a *BADDIE* Barbie: teaches you *moral conscious*
barbie has better movies but bratz dolls are so much more inclusive and aesthetically prettier with the clothes
I didn't realize how bad those Barbie movies looked
Can’t believe Kurtis is cancelled again
The bratz soundtrack was superior in every way
Any of yall remember Barbie Princess Charm School cus?? That was my second fave movie. IT SLAPPED??
CHECK OUT: CHAD CHAD   TELL ME SHES NOT THE EPITOME OF KURTISSSSSSSSS 🤓
“do i wanna gnome” ..... sigh
Ive always just watched barbie movies, they're so pog aha
ain’t no question. bratz is and always will be the best !
do i wanna gnome is the last straw.
Bratz is the best
number 2 on trending hell yea kurtis
ya hooo da ba yo
Very happy not getting a special greeting
Thank you for ruining my childhood! 😭 🤧
U chose the best Bratz movie
The freakin coincidence that the Youtube algorithm started recommending me videos ranking the Barbie movies just last week.....Youtube knows me way too well xD My nostalgia is being targetted so hard lately.
every time barbie goes                                  b a l l s                                   I want to fucking cry
#2 on trending slay kurtis
The pixie dust was hurting them cuz they were evil
Fun fact: Mattel came out with MyScene dolls as a response to Bratz dolls a year later!   Another fun fact: due to Mattel's Monster High dolls and their popularity, MGA came out with Bratzillaz dolls who are cousins of Bratz characters!
People were mad at Bratz for making girls insecure when Barbie had a waistline that could snap in half against a strong wind 💨   7:53 for reference
Do ever after high vs monster bight next
I grew up loving Bratz but looking at them now after not thinking about them in years, I'm kinda horrified of their crazy ass proportions
Barbie vs Bratz fight will never end. Bratz appeals more people than Barbie, heavily due to the diversity Bratz has. Although Bratz movies have worse animation quality than the Barbie ones, they're iconic.
Bratz pixies was the damn best
Gnome = Nail horan
xool'  xsw wepo
kurt looks like that one hippie uncle and i absolutely cannot take him seriously because of that
Yo this was one of your best videos deadass I was pissing myself laughing
Kurtis: This is just not realistic okay.  Me: None of this ever was Kurtis.
Kurt boy...you didn’t watch a movie with BIBBLE?? Watch Barbie mermaidia then we’ll talk
Your the next LBGQTFUAzz
Princess charm school was life
The Rapunzel movie is a masterpiece and don’t ever forget it 😤
Yes this is the discourse i wanna see
Barbie kids are scary.
kinda disappointed because u left out the scene where she paints all of the dresses on. that is the best part.
Please make a Bratz vs barbie commentary series!! Would watch the shit out of that barbie was my childhood and I love watching those Bratz movies out of context videos
I really want his reaction to Bratz Super Babyz
Those movies are so weird
This video is WAY funnier than it should be oh my god my stomach hurts from laughing so hard what
I love Bratzs but Barbie is a lesbian icon...
i could tell u we’re getting sick of the extra greeting 💀
Barbie as Repunzel was my absolute favorite barbie movie growing up!
Barbie taught pure life lesson, Bratz taught you how to be a bad bitch.😏
12:30 I don't know about anyone else, but the no music part made it that much scarier and realer for me when I was little. I still remember the scene.
Ya hoooo da ba yo
this is the best single video that exists in youtube!!! in kinda cryin cus its now my comfort video
Bro im seriously crying rn 18:44      "Do i wanna gnome-" BAHAHAHHAHAJDLELFŞSWSNFKEJKF-
THE VIDEO WE NEEDED!!!
GIVE ME MY EXTRA GREETING KURT
Am the only one that is going to say that rapunzel and stephane are both brothers and sister and they get married at the end wich is fucked up😵😵😵😵😵😵😵
Barbie MOVIES are TOP TIER but Bratz DOLLS are better
Just so ye know callini is the Irish word for girls, I think the gnome is more of a mixture of a gnome and a leprechaun 😂
ya hooo da ba yo
she wrapped her hair around the window column, that puts the pressure of her head and on the column, I think they did a similar thing in tangled
if all fire hydrants are garden gnomes then all garden gnomes are fire hydrants?
It’s an honor to be born the same year as when the Bratz came out 💜💅🏼
https://youtu.be/oHg5SJYRHA0
Kurtis be looking like 80’s Weird Al Yankovic and I 100% support it
18:54 I almost thought a chunk was missing from Kurtis’ ear..
kurt ur gonna need to make at least one of the iconic audios from these movies into soundboard sounds
kurtis conner is purposefully neglecting his fans now? wow. im more than disappointed.
bless you, dude
10:05 DOTH THOU CARPETS MATCH THY DRAPES STFU IM CACKLINGKUHFGM
You should’ve watched a different barbie movie, you chose the worst one
The creepy weasel is voiced by Peter Kelamis, who was also the voice of Rolf from Ed, Edd n Eddy ✌ (Also, the evil witch is kinda obviously Anjelica Huston) 😘
Everyone make bald kurtis their pfp everywhere
Lemme end all fights rn Barbie movies  But bratz dollz
I didn't think I needed a video more
LES GO KURTIS TOWN,  2ND ON TRENDING 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
1:18 I can see the pride in your eyes after saying this and failing to do so a hundred times before
as someone with a huge forehead I must say leave my girl Kelly alone
ngl kinda happy he didn't do that old obnoxious intro lmao, probably the only one but It'd be awesome if he got creative with some new intros :)
BRATZ OVER BARBIE 10000000%
Bruh the nostalgia of this video- I used to love all of these movies. Barbie, Bratz, Moster High. I had at least one doll from each series.
Barbie vs Bratz. Meanwhile sitting in the porch that my mother uses as a bedroom: Sad American Girl noises.
Kurtis be like: https://youtu.be/UTC4gMxivII
My 12 year old son and I are big fans, which just occured to me that I may make questionable parenting choices. Anyway, this video is possibly the most hilarious, in my opinion. So good! We cracked up the entire time.
Okay... who’s gonna own up to not telling him about Barbie The Princess and the Pauper. I just want to talk.
You should’ve watched barbie diamond castle 😩 it’s literally the best one ever 💅🏻 original cottage core lesbians
My tea is that barbie is a lesbian 🏌
KURTIS TYSM FOR POSTING
Why is there a painting of a little black girl on barbies wall lmao who is that 23:29
10:18 has me wheezing
oh my god. I just realized what terrified me about Bratz as a child (except not looking white enough, which is just sad). they have no nose. or, their nose just fades into the face bc the eyes and lips are so pronounced. fucking terrifying indeed
My brother when he was little loved Toy story and was buzz like 7 years in a row. He used to go check his room really secretly because he wanted to catch his toys playing. It was cute.
I’m so confused as to why they made this man just grab her entire waist like that at 7:52 wtf lmfao 😭
I subscribed for that extra greeting, Kurtis. That's the only thing that keeps me alive. Dolls be damned!
wtf briannas friends are the fucking main characters?? how hard is to remember cool kat, angel, princess, and bunny boo 🙄
Nice
Leaving a comment because I want to, and not because if I hadn't, I would've been slandered by editor Kurtis.
ya hooo da ba yo
I'd pay to watch Dillon dance
the way he reinforces that he isnt a virgin is kinda sus tho,u sure about that?
"flying Unicorn" uhhh pegasus GOSH 🥴😒
Please review more barbie movies :) Some are genuinely great and super nostalgic (Barbie in a Mermaid Tale, for example), and some are genuinely horrifying and haunt my nightmares (Barbie Fairytopia and Barbie Fairytopia Mermaidia).
great video
So tired of people comparing two queens
I laughed so hard at "do I wanna gnome"
Barbie Rapunzel used Dvorak's New World Symphony as its score rather than writing their own but that in no way excuses them from not using ANYTHING for that chase scene
Bratz was my childhood
Is it just me or was this whole video just horni
When a was a child Barrie princess charm school was played on repeat and to be honest I think it would still hold up today. 😂 xx
the lesson we learnt today: TWERKING IS POWERFUL.  also Kelly is the scariest fucking thing ever laid eyes on by the naked human eye
Alright imma say it. Are pixies high 24/7 cause like look at their world
im pretty sure of all the budget for the bratz movies went to animating their hair😭
i hate you this video made me shit myself bcos i laughed too hard
please watch 12 dancing princesses. best barbie movie
you should’ve watched bratz: passion 4 fashion but i definitely agree that bratz is wayyyyy better than barbie. that being said i grew up on both franchises sooooo
"So no Headwig?" Absolutely sent me!!!
You should have pick Bratz Kids Fairy tale for a real comparison (because the two movies presents a version of Rapunzel) ! Btw great video
I had an extensive Bratz Dolls collection when I was a kid, and kept them in my parents house when I got older because I wanted to give them to my future daughter someday.  My dad was cleaning out the basement once and brought ALL OF THEM to goodwill because he thought I wouldn't miss them. I haven't forgiven him to this day and that was 10 years ago
barbie movies were better but bratz were beating her ass in every other category
Bratzzz
bratz DOLLS are better BUT the movies... barbie wins, especially the older ones like mermaid, princess and the pauper, mariposa etc.
I want to watch this but your moustache is scaring me...
jurtis is such a vibe!!! anyways watermelons r nice <4
I dont want much for my birthday hope whoever's reading this will have a wonderful day beside their family ( sorry for my English)
I’m unsubscribing. I was specifically here for the extra greeting.
My parents never let me play with bratz because they said that they were too slutty. What does that even mean? Lmao I hate that I missed out, it makes me want to collect them now. Bratz look cool af. The outfits are iconic.
She has a friggen dragon friend literally use the dragon to get out of the tower
im still mad about the lack of extra greeting... i don't feel special anymore as a subscriber and that makes me sad. Otherwise rad vid man
Me, who liked both Barbie and Bratz growing up
I love this, i love u for this
if ur family taught u about race and shit at a young age then theres a problem with that. i never cared about barbie being a white girl. And loved all the barbie movies so much. Not once did i ever think about her being white. not everything is about race. theres more important things in the world and in ur life than that.
mustache strong as shit boy
We need Kurtis reacting to every Barbie movie
Is anyone else a little disappointed that Kurtis didn’t include the scene in bratz where Dylan bellyslides around like a fricking penguin or is it just me
Kelly looks like pennywise
how are you gonna refer to the main characters of the whole franchise "brianna's friends"
It's barbie. Period
I honestly grew up with Bratz the outfits were so iconic, and I love binge watching it
I love the moustache and I love the mullet. Please never get rid of them.
Brats dolls are way better than barbie dolls...              I mean don’t blame me Barbie dolls are CREEPYYYY
omg that weasel moaning is so gross and sounds wet and squelchy :")
I haven’t laughed as hard as I did at the angry twerking bit since the last time I watched Drew and Danny use the Jeremy renner app
Please can you do ronal the barbarian? I wached a review for it the other day... Serious goat story vibes
bruhhh i was a fan of both when i was a kid, i had both barbie and bratz dolls, watched barbie movies and played bratz games on the ps2 lmao
No extra greeting? Fucking unsubbed
fuck bratz or barbie monster high was where it was at
How dare you, I am un subbing now because I don't have an incentive
The video no one asked for but everyone is grateful for
Clicked for Bratz stayed for moustache
Funny thing about that law suit: the inventor of Bratz came up with the idea while working for Mattel so when the inventor left Mattel to start making Bratz,  they saw it as intellectual property infringement.
the "balls" sound effect that keeps coming... i cant stop laughing
Best Barbie movie is Princess And The Pauper,,,  No musical movie will ever achieve with that movie did
why didnt u do princess charm school forget the refusing to do the extra greeting, you are canceled because princess charm school is superior
Just came to say that BRATZ is SUPERIOR! It was diverse and not white washed like Barbie. BRATZ was REAL, and BARBIE was just a white girl fantasy. Also Bratz MUSIC, like hello it was AMAZING, their dolls were iconic, their fits were the freshest, they had the best male dolls.  Imagine putting in as much work as female dolls into your male dolls as well.  Barbie dolls wack af, clothes wack, movies entertaining ngl but still Bratz tv show, games, and movies were better.  We only know Barbie and Ken, while Bratz had so many unforgettable characters. Sorry Barbie! Even MyScene Dolls and movies were better than Barbie!
Monster high was obviously the best one out of these two
THE "HOLDING MYSELF ACCOUNTABLE" LMAO
bless you
"IM IN CONTROL HERE" 🤣🤣🤣
Bro but let’s talk about Polly Pockets and MyScene dolls
I feel stolen from as a citizen of Kurtis town and NOT getting a extra greeting? What’s next?? No ‘folks’?!  Kurtis town is a democracy                    (This is a joke don’t come @ me)
Scrotum scrolls? They're obviously called SCROLL-tums. Duh. Obviously.
mattel me that ! hahahahhahahaha that was very funny
Two words: Monster High.
Barbie movies are better but Bratz dolls are more fashionable and fun
This guy is such a simp trying to get feminists points
hedwig is a girl kurtis. ok bye
I love Bratz  That's it  That's the comment
Bratz are more cool dolls, but Barbie films won every single time. I grew up with A Fairy Secret and Mermaid's Tale (1+2)
The video should have been called 'Kurtis Hates Kelly'
Stop no dont pose this question goodbye krutis
lololol I am so excited to watch this video.. I've been loving the topics you've been covering lately!
Hahaha Kurtis saying Aweee to 4 scenes then being scared because of how the kids are drew lmao
seeing these movies again after years made me realize how bad the animation is lmao, I thought it was the best thing ever when I was a kid
Team Barbie❤ Idk bratz was never fun for me
MaTEL me THAT
i thought chalk zone was a fever dream
Your merch is always SO good 🥵🔥
omgggg thia is the first video from u im watching ..this is so fucking funny
I might miss the point here, but why is your skin perfect?? 😮
i had and love both bruh i cannot choose n their movies too 💅
please make this a series, I will dig holes for kelly to fall into if you do
Who else is rioting because we didn’t get our extra greeting.?
No!
I think we should put "Is a horney weasel" somewhere in his wiki...
Chalk zone was my freaking show, man.
WE’RE FINALLY DISCUSSING KELLY’S GIANT FOREHEAD 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Barbie went to greendale confirmed
brutal
Trick question - if you choose Barbie OR Bratz you're gay. Real Men grew up playing with Doll's
gosh that mid-2000s computer animation is just so fucking cursed
Lmao Kurtis! ^^ We're the same age
Now THIS is the kind of content I’m looking for
We got numba 2 on da trend
You really knocked it out of the park with this one lol this video is hilarious
I grew up with the Barbie movies and dolls and like them but i never disliked Bratz i think their outfits are cooler but idk why both sides need to fight each other like that's just dumb
Only Arabs will remember " fullah فلا " 😭😭😭
Weird
As someone with long hair - if it was wrapped around something else and I was grabbing at the base, I don't think it would hurt.
kurtis we need a video solely dedicated to you reviewing the rest of the early 2000's barbie movies asap, just watching one is only scratching the surface of the masterpieces that are the barbie movies
Wtf kurtis you just personally attacked me, by not doing the extra greeting
Ok but what about Monster High 🤨
The clear winner here is monster high
Okay yes the bratz movies were dope and sometimes couldn’t even compare to the couple exceptional Barbie movies (looking at you twelve dancing princesses), but why is nobody talking about their tv show?! Like the plot, the villain, the villain helpers with the subplot of them being a diff level of dumb, and the great female protagonists who had starter careers while still in school! Like was it all a fever dream or did it exist??🤨
Oh man I had the Barbie Repunzel movie on VHS and watched that so much as a kid. As a kid I had both dolls. Bratz had the coolest outfits and styles, but Barbie had so much cool accessories, like a party bus with a hot tub.
Okay but that pixie rave looked lit.
problematic.
The only reason ur saying Bratz is better is because u watched the wrong Barbie movie PLZ GO WATCH ISLAND PRINCESS IT SLAPS SO HARD
توفيق
as someone who equally loves bratz and barbies, and collects both, this video was your most controversial one yet bud
#cancelkurtis #wheremyextragreeting
Congrats on #2 trending!!
kurtis, a “flying unicorn” is called a pegasus😔
this was a great vid! a lot more spirit than a few recently
I'm sorry guys but it was always MyScene for me
Finally something worth watching on the trending vids
11:01
No Kurtis they sued Bratz because the creator of bratz used to work for Mattel and they stole the idea for bratz from the MyScene dolls
For dolls Bratz win but Barbie has the most iconic kid movies. The live action bratz movie was terrible and like a knock off mean girls lol 😂
oh how the floodgates burst open when the first scene of barbie rapunzel started playing... i completely forgot about that movie
You need to watch Barbie and the Rockers - peak Barbie from the 1980s! https://youtu.be/TH_Ya4uJqxw
Definitely Bratz over Barbie for everything
Why is this 2 on trending? Lol
when your name is kelly D:>
What about Monster high?
I already have current can I still get the monies 🥺 I'm broke
Kurtis
those aren’t pixie glasses that’s LSD honey 😭
Dylan in Bratz really do be throwing that ass back :0
I managed just over half and that's all I can take. You definitely made this topic more watchable than I thought possible, but the doll animation became too much. Goodbye till next time cowboy bubba 🙏
Please review Bratz babies the potato one I’m not sure of the name but it scarred me…
Oh my God kurtis you need to review barbie princess and the Pauper, you would enjoy the humor in that one. Plus it's the best in my opinion
Guys he’s going off the rails I’m really scared
#kurtisisoverpartyagainparty
Omg my childhood in one video
why did I unironically like the bratz movie
SO NO HEADWIG
Does anyone remember celebrity death match? It'd be sick if they did one w Barbie vs whoever the HBIC Bratz doll is
lmfao this was so hilarious lololol
#2 on trending 💁🏼‍♀️
ya hooo da ba yo   <3
also pls watch more barbie movies! thank u for catering to of ur female audience LMAO
On trending 😼🤝🔥
Great video Kurtis. Keep working on that moustache and fulfill your destiny of becoming John Oates.
Every scene with the kids is horrifying yet hilarious
i love the barbie classics but the braz is ahhhhhhh the fuckingggggg best
i was fucking obsessed with Small Soldiers. the first time i heard the Spice Girls Wannabe and nobody else seems to remember or have seen it in there life when i would watch it monthly
kurtis you are my favorite youtuber.
I watched pretty much every barbie movie i could get my hands on and my faves were: -Princess and the Pauper -Fairytopia: Mermaidia -Swan Lake -Nutcracker -Barbie Diaries (terrible animation tho) -Magic of Pegasus  I also loved the one Bratz movie I had and I loved both dolls! The bratz clothes were soo much cuter
I feel like you can’t compare them. They are good in their own way. Like barbie is the best friends, nostalgia movies from when you were little and had a DVD. And Bratz were just to early for their time, if they had come out now people would go crazy after them. They were really inclusive, the dolls looked cool and they had really good style. You can’t compare these.
bless you
crime that he didnt pick bratz genie magic but its fine. i'd love to see kurtis watch my scene goes hollywood on stream sometime!
I can't imagine being 27 and be able to watch these films and critically comment on it. So that's some hard work and it's funny too
don't need no extra greeting, only seggy mustache
sorry but monster high tops all🙄
My top three Fav Barbie movies are The Nutcracker, Swan Lake and Princess and the Pauper, and I had a long hard Fairtopia/Mermadia phase, obsessed. So I was kinda peeved that Kurtis picked this one since Rapunzl was kinda low on my list🥲
kurtis are u bibble?
Give him to me EUGH😩🔥
it was refreshing to know that after watching the Bratz pixie movie a million times as a kid i still know the plot by heart
yup bratz win
Good one.
Ya hooo da ba yo :3
bruh you should have watched barbie fairytopia or barbie mermaidia
please trim your mustache kurtis, please, i beg you ....
Ya hooo da ba yo

This was awsome! 🤗
Bratz movies used to scare the hell out of me. Especially that one with the carnival dreams and the clowns and mirrors.
You have an ugly sneeze.
Pause at 14:01 it’s truly terrifying
I loved Bratz, but the movies were horrible, god 💀
mattel me that- i will never unsubsrcibe
Imagine being named Kelly and hearing kurtis constantly trash your existence😬
Rapunzel being bald act happened in shrek
i literally grew up on barbies and bratz. My mom didn’t wanna buy me the bratz dolls because they were tooooo “radical”, so i played with my friend’s doll lol
18:19 as an Irish person I can confirm we speak like that😏
PLEASE review a Monster High movie
Kelly crying the club rn. Kurtis did not hold back on that VERY REAL little girl
When I was young I had both dolls and I liked both, I think I liked Barbie a little bit more because I liked the more whimsical dresses and tiaras and bratz I think I found their clothes boring but I was super super young then(I appreciate their appeal much more now). I donated all of my bratz and barbies before I moved to another state and by that time Monster High dolls came out and those were by far my favorite dolls because of all the character lore, the cool packaging and official art, the super creative personalized  fashion that was created for every character, and the fact that the shoes came off, not the whole foot lmfao.
Kurtis looks like Christopher Walken
Hey Kurtis for the future can you put a flashing lights/strobe warning for scenes like the evil pixie party (not a sentence i thought i would type) I have epilepsy and i’m sensitive to flashing lights! Thank you mayor kurtis!
Bratz for lyfe
well I didn't get my extra greeting, you broke our contract, this is over now byeeee
Very unhappy with product, was guaranteed and extra greeting and was basically yelled at by the manager I’m shocked
I'm so sad about not getting a greeting:( 😭😭😭
Hedwig was a girl, Kurtis
It’s so weird to look back at old barbue cartoons, 3D animations evolved so much in the last few years. But the old animation is part of the nostalgia these movies hive.
Kurtis and I doing the same dance move to the crow chase scene made my day loll who needs rhythm with dance moves like ours? 🤷🏽‍♀️
You mean to tell me Quentin Tarantino lost in the horniest weasel category…. Something about that doesn’t sit right
Not getting the extra greeting was incredibly unsettling
Barbie was life. For me. Never got into brats. My parents didn’t let me which I understand as a 6-7 year old watching teenage girls have boyfriends and sneaking out at night probably wasn’t going to be great for my childhood. But for an older audience I get it. But barbie had really cool dolls that came out like really creative ideas. But brats was more just 2000s clothes and that’s it. Barbie had fantasy, sports, special editions etc. BUT Barbie hardly had any diversity at all. Only now are they starting to make them more diversity .   If u watch any of the first 5 Barbie movies there is not a single person of color,  not even Asian or anything. Pure white washed. Which is disappointing. Still they lack it a lot in the modern movies today.  What if they did a Barbie movie where Barbie is a person of color? That would be amazing,  ALSO. Why has Barbie movies and dolls gotten so bad. WHERES THE SPICE GONE. Barbies are double the price then they used to be but they lack details or anything at all. It’s so disappointing. Even the movies suck. Why WHYYYY
For the longest time I only saw the “g” and I was so confused
ya hooo da ba yo
Anyone remember Monster High? Loved that shit and honestly still do.
Kurtis please do a video watching Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper
kurtis dancing is so hot for some reason, even tho he literally looks like the biggest idiot.
yes i know
Bro? Why did he choose Rapunzel
When he said the scene... My Scene flashbacks
Omfg you unlocked a memory with chalkzone
Barbie in the Nutcracker is our family favourite, it has some weird ass characters and really dorky scenes and we absolutely love it. We used to watch it (particularly my dad and I) at Christmas time every year, and eventually fell off the tradition. I'm 26 now and I really wanna watch it with him one more time in the winter.
As a kid I couldn’t stand that weasel. Something was just not right. Thank you for addressing this very important issue.
That's exactly what a virgin would say
Okay but…for some reason, watching Kurtis talk about dolls makes me want to marry him and take a mustache ride. It’s mostly the mustache tbh.
Dang, you missed a family tree joke
Happy #2 on trending!!   Also happy Juneteenth 🥰
I always used to be scared of braz lmaoooo  Idk its the gigantic eyes and the Lack of a nose
Meanwhile,  I was the kid that got angry when a family member bought me barbies.  I was the weirdo playing with Jurassic Park toys lol.
kelly looks like a sims toddler 😭
the weasel's raw sex appeal makes him live rent free in kurtis' mind
It doesn’t matter how good the video is we will continue commenting on kurtis’s hair
*sees title* Me: *...interesting...*
My parents never let me play with Bratz because the were called Bratz
One is stuck playing the impassioned protagonist in one’s Subjective Narrative of Self 🎈
I definitely like bratz dolls more but I like the barbie movies more more specifically rapunzel, nutcracker, swan lake, and princess and the pauper. Bratz Rock Angelz does kick ass tho. Edit: Barbie as rapunzel seemed better when I was a kid lol
hello
The pixie glasses seem like a "kid friendly" way of showing what it's like to take magic shrooms
Princess and The Pauper is the best Barbie Movie. Second is Island Princess.
I smiled
You should have watched bratz rock angels or bratz genies come ON Kurtis
stefan looks like christian bale
🤣😂"what the fuq repunzil"😄 said nobody ever until now
I am a male and I've watched Barbie Movies as a kid because I liked to cringe at them and there was no better alternative during the time of broadcast. It was bad and therefore kinda hilarious.
YOU NEED TO WATCH BRATZ IN PARIS BC ITS LITERALLY A FEVER DREAM LIKE I CANT EVEN EXPLAIN HOW WEIRD AND ODDLY TERRIFYING IT IS
kurtis …. you should’ve watched BRATZ ROCK ANGELZ. at least a film with the OG girlies !!!!!!
My mom didn’t let me have a bratz doll because they dressed “immodestly” But that didn’t stop me my sister from turning them into strippers
Oooh highly disagree with you on this one. Barbie movies were a big part of my childhood and Rapunzel is definitely one of my faves. Princess & the Pauper is also amazing and so many more.
https://youtu.be/Ygsc9jcn2ds
The goth pixie looks like young Joey Jordisson
Really annoyed Kurt didn’t say “snow-caine” as a pun
"Repunzel is bald now" Me: Likes immediately 💗🤣
My sisters watched these movies a while ago, and I still remember everything that happens in each movie to this day
kurtis. k u r t i s. listen.  do not *ever* make an arctic monkeys reference when discussing horrific miniature gnomes. i had to pause the video. i cried a little. i’m back now, i’m composed, but i feel like there was a true shift in reality during do i wanna gnome. what have you done edited to add i cannot accept your apology in good faith i am a changed person now because of your actions sir
I remember watching that bratz movie when I was a kid. I never really had barbies but I had so many bratz dolls growing up.
Can’t believe you picked Repunzel over fairytopia
#2 on trending let’s go
Me unsubscribing because I didn’t get an extra greeting
"could a virgin have a podcast?"     no but they could have that mustache........
Every kid movie has a weird character like that weasel.
Team monster high forever
I used to watch Barbie as rapunzel every day I had it on vhs it was literally my favorite movie and I had completely forgot about it until now😭
Now all kurtis needs to do is react to a Monster High movie and the doll movie trilogy will be completed
Bratz used the end of the Scooby Doo movie. People in a dance trance, then they destroy a ball/orb and then boom, dancing is done.
I stg if the moaning weasel becomes kurtis's new making it stinky™️ I'm unsubscribing /j
i love the silent action scene in rapunzel lmao
bratz fashion pixies is all i remember from my childhood...thank u kurt
Us kurtistown members must riot in the streets we did not receive an extra greeting at the start of the video
Honestly glad you said fuck the extra greeting. Could tell you were over the intro.
kurtis saying barbie doesn’t have an asshole implies brats do have assholes
hard to think illumi and kurtis are almost the same age
The weasel is my favorite character. 😍
Crying throughout the entirety of this video 😂…      Due to laughter 🙂
SHUT THE HELL UP, BRATZ IS BETTER.... BARBIE IS LITERALLY FAKE ASF 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🙏🙏
Please react to the Barbie Nutcracker movie next. For some reason that was my shit as a kid.
✨🎶Rapunzel is bald nowww🎵✨
"Doth thou carpet match thine drapes" while there is screaming in the background is CLASSIC
Final round: Bratz vs. Monster High
Did y’all know that Kurtis is a virgin?
Where the FUCK is the extra greeting
Wow my major, you are 42 place on trending in germany rn and all the other videos above are from german creators, mad respect
bratz pixies slaps so fucking hard, it’s actually the best one.. BRO CURTIS WHY DID YOU CHOOSE RAPUNZEL OUT OF ALL BARBIE MOVIES
On the subject of LIT doll inspired tv shows and movies, you should have included MyScene in this!
Ball/scrotum scrolls 🤦🏾‍♂️😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣 this man's commentary is HYSTERICAL
I'm crying dude 😂
✨wood chipper✨
a sneeze?? 😏
I can’t believe there’s not an extra greeting tis a Sad day
I just realized that barbies kind of give me republican vibes
Bratz <3 I vaguely remember my family getting me nothing but the yasmin and sasha dolls one christmas, because they looked like me
um excuse me WHERE is my extra greeting? i ordered an extra greeting with my DRINK 🥤 >:(
Bratz are definitely superior babes like the fashion??? the diversity????
if Kurtis thinks Kelly is bad I want him to discover Bibble
I love the extra greeting energy kurtis i’m proud
Up next: monster high vs bratz. Please 😩
the real og’s had monster high dolls
Dylan always wins
I'm Argentinian and I thought VRG standed for VERGA
lel that clap actually really did hurt my ears, as well as that ironic dub step garbagio randomly inserted in for the lulz, (this is because I have eustachian tube dysfunction) so its not you're fautl. loud noises just really hurt my ears more than they would the average person.
I came to see why a GROWN MAN SPEAKING ABOUT BARBIES AND BRATZ DOLLS WAS TRENDING ON YOUTUBE. I stayed for the intellectual discourse. 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤦🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ What is life coming to? And what a time to be alive!
I found this very entertaining despite never owning a single bratz or barbie doll
i just watched barbie the princess and the pauper two nights ago and now u post this video.........
What about the monster high movies tho
We didn't subscribe for no extra greeting.
11:00 IM GONNA LOSE MY MINNNDNDNDJEJDWKDNOWXN
if u had watched princess and the pauper trust me ur opinion on barbie movies would be way different........ that movie is life changing
I will be honest, I don't even own dolls cuz I'm pretty sure I threw them away before I moved out when I was young. Dolls scares me :')
Wood chipper? I hardy know her
im like that weasel looking at you i can hardly watch ur videos. hng
Bratz were some bad bitches 💅🚶
feel like getting high and watching some Bratz movies with the boys
“The horniest weasel goes to:”
That’s the first genuine Irish accent I’ve ever heard in a movie
My mom was always weirded out by the weasel and I never understood it as a kid but now I saw this video and it makes sense 😂😂😂
The fact he complained about Kelly, but not, like, any of the Bratz characters... I'm sorry I love the Bratz movies but the art and animation was just horrific
Both brands were my childhood. Barbie movies were more magical, but the Bratz show and movies were so fun and occasionally creepy in the best way.
u HAVE to do the bratz sleepover adventure, i got nightmares from that stuff
wait a minute… if barbie was the kings daughter and so was stephen… then they’re siblings …. so…
Ahhhhhhhhhh whyyyy didn’t he do his extra greetingggg
finally I can subscribed. Its so annoying getting extra greeting 🙄 i wish hed shut up more
ya hooo da ba yo
18:44 LMAOO
Petition for Kurtis to turn "b a l l s" into a twitch alert sound
Every time Kurtis calls himself old I die a little inside because I own Game Boy games that are older than him.   ...*_BALLS_*
E Pluribus Anus
Maybe I’m just biased since Barbie was always my favorite as a kid and I never watched Bratz, but I I think Barbie Magic of Pegasus would be a better movie to compare to Fashion Pixiez. I always thought Rapunzel was kinda boring tbh.
When i was a kid, I used to get mad everytime they rescued Kelly in any Barbie movie. Feel you Kurtis
i grew up watching barbie movies but bratz will always be cooler
kurty is feeling silly today 😜😜😜😜😜
HEDWIG WAS A GIRL. 😭😭😭😭
im sad. ungreeted.
IVE BEEN WAITING FIOR THIS ONE !!!!!
I grew up a massive Barbie Stan and when I tell you the moment I found out me and barbies little sister share the same first AND last name.... I felt the stars align (so yes she's real, its me, I also have a big forehead)
How come I never questioned these movies when I was little? Lmao I swear they made so much sense
I need to know where Kurtis got a high quality version of Bratz Fashion Pixies that movie was my childhood
Love how this is #2 on trending
I looove the barbie movies! I watched pretty much all of them and I also watched bratz rock angels and bratz starrin' & stylin' on repeat. I owned both barbie dolls and bratz dolls and I love them all.
aairplane and caddyshack are great movies oh my god. good posters.
PLEASE make a video abt bratz super babyz,,, it's so bizarre it would be a great video!!
FYI Hedwig is a GIRL.🤬🤬🤬🤬
Lol that is a pretty hard question..
sorry had to unsubscribe, its just not worth it without that extra greeting
I may get hate but Barbie Princess Cham School is the BEST barbie movie
Shave the moustache dude please.
when u mentioned small soldiers literally 52 secs into the vid i screamed at my phone cause i totally forgot ab that movie and how much nightmares it gave me when i was 4
ya hooo ba da yo
His mind would have been blown of he saw Barbie and the Diamond Castle. Cottagecore lesbians.
How dare you not validate my nostalgia and give Barbie a 10/10 >:(
thank you mister kurtis sir for digging up some embarrassing memories of my barbie swan lake and bratz babies era. now i must revisit this forgotten time.
You should check out Barbie life in the dream house, watched it with my niece and my sister. It’s *gold*
kurtis i’m mad you picked the worst barbie movie for this </3
When I saw you posted I thought to myself "holy shit finally" it's been a long week :)
I like Barbie better but that’s probably only because it was my whole childhood and I’m biased
the way he only calls them "briyannas friends" is so fucking funny seeing as theyre the main characters of the movies and the franchise itself
plsss the weasel
Dude u still exist 😕
2:46 “Mattel me that” best joke of the century second only to the elite “why two k?”  Edit: “do I wannaaa gnomeee” takes third place
we’ve been waiting for your take on this
I remember watching Barbie as Rapunzel as a kid and thinking it was a Spyro crossover because of Penelope.
Please watch Barbie a fairy secret
Kurtis trying to stop himself from laughing after the ‘do I wanna gnome’ joke is the funniest moment of the whole video
I cant believe he didn’t watch a bratz movie w tweevils. Missin out
the dancing in the bratz movie scared the absolute fuck out of me as a child lmfao
And you've officially done it... The greatest video on YouTube.
KURTIS UR #2 ON TRENDING 🥳🥳🥳🥳!!! YAYAYAYAYAYA!!!!!!!😁😁🔊🔊🔊
Why's kurtis got guitar hero 2 on his shelf
I used to watch the shit out of both
I literally have always thought the letters in the back meant virgin :0 im ded

Wait Kelly is her sister? I always made Kelly her daughter LMFAOOOO
THE WAY MY BRAIN BROKE WHEN 'DO I WANNA GNOME' HAPPENED. kurtis you are a genius.
I lost it with that angry twerk
Funny video
I'm the same age as Kurtis and I always had Barbies. I never really liked Bratz dolls, and not because adults didn't like them, they looked too freakish to me. I also always liked to make clothes for my dolls, so maybe that's why I subconsiously preffered Barbie dolls because propportions where a bit closer to actual humans than Bratz dolls.  I see so many people writing in the comments how they never could relate to Barbie because of their skin color, but that was never an issue to me, and I'm not white, I'm hispanic. I never understood wanting your toys to look like you, but I get not everyone has the same way of viewing things.  Even now I don't like the Bratz aesthetic, but I see why so many people find them cooler than Barbie. I guess I've always been a nerd lol. Sorry for my bad english.
so before the vid is over , im personally loving the bratz movie way more and think its the better of the two .
kurtis why didn’t you watch barbie fairytopia?? now you will never experience the joys of bibble
Me seeing VRG as a latina guys different 😂😂
My guy... #2 on trending??? Killing it
This is my favorite video you have ever made.
Do the greeting
I was JUST binging barbie movies and then you post this?!?!?!?!!?!?!? WOW coincidence? i think not
bratz fashion pixies was the one movie i had on DVD i would watch it every saturday lmaoooo it was so weird this unlocked a memory
Petition to get the complete version of “Rapunzel is bald now”?
Should have watched  Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper Hands down the best Barbie movie
GOOD JOB ON TRENDING!!
18:59 that subtle james charles reference took me out
why was the pixie king lowkey a dilf-
okay the extra greeting being gone is whatever. but the folks clap SHOULD NEVER LEAVE
i do miss the extra greeting but i understand all things must come to an end
did you just artic monkey me?
Should we tell him about MyScene dolls?
This is the worst YouTube channel out there
Both of these films is disgusting to look at
you choosing barbie rapunzel and not barbie princess and the pauper is criminal
7:41 be careful about what you say, your wife can become a black panther for 11 years
Those Barbie Rapunzel clips brought back memories from my childhood!!!!
Honestly Kurtis, I like the way you dance. Fuck it UP King ⚡️
this was mad entraining
I have been having reoccurring dreams about that pixie bratz movie since 2012.
Man, I hate recieving unsolicited scrotum scrolls.
You had the opportunity to watch Princess and the Pauper and you didn't.
ya hooo da ba yo
Bratz music is so good for no reason!
kurtis i hate you. im still mad at not getting my extra greeting. 😡
I thought I was the only person ever that watched small soldiers
NOOOO OMG SO THATS THE SHOW WITH THE MOANING WEASEL
I first read “Barbie vs Barbz” and my mind did not think twice about the fact that that might not be the right title
i lived off of the barbie movies when i was a kid! my favorites were barbie island princess and barbie princess and the pauper!
No extra greeting? This is unprecedented. I’m not sure how to proceed from here.
Was not expecting to get hate-crimed at the beginning of the video when Kurtis didn’t do the intro on purpose 😢
ya hooo da ba yo
WHAT ABOUT THE PRINCESS AND THE PAUPER
Hey i watch your vids an i love them... But urhmm. . . the only reason Penelope didnt resue rapunzel earlier by flying to her window was because she couldn't fly properly an was still learning... Soooo  chill.. Just defending my fav.movie as a kid ...😂
very good video, i liked the "balls" sound. What are you gonna have for dinner Mr. Conner
Hey i watch your vids an i love them... But urhmm. . . the only reason Penelope didnt resue rapunzel earlier by flying to her window was because she couldn't fly properly an was still learning... Soooo  chill.. Just defending my fav.movie as a kid ...😂
blessing us with a 30min video, AND ITS ABOUT BARBIE AND BRATZ? immaculate
I’m offended that you referred to the main four Bratz dolls as “friends” the whole time, but also thank you for a half hour of reliving my childhood🙏
oooh, boy, this movie is so different not dubbed over in greek.
i feel cheated. i subscribed two and a half years ago purely for the extra greeting, not cus i liked your shitty ass content. for you to blatantly deny me that privilege that i hit the subscribe button for is abhorrent.
It would be amazing if Kurtis watched the live BRATZ movie from 2007!!!!
Are we gonna talk about how  Stephen was able to fit his hands around Barbie's ENTIRE waist. Like that went through and no one had a problem with that.
why is no one mad he didn't do an extra greeting wtf :(
Barbie Life in the Dream House was the best show
Well, if you insist about leaving a comment... It's the first video I ever saw on your channel, and I've got to say, you just earned a new subscriber! 🌸 There is something abour your sense of humor and charisma that I can't pass on. So I know that I will be watching your content for the next few hours for sure 👀👌
The balls jokes proves the mayor isn't a virgin.
you chose the actual worst bratz movie to review.. i remember when i was a kid i watched bratz movies that were so much better you should go watch the rest like pls review all bratz movies and then make a tier list.. omg that would be so elite...  edit: damn not me going on an absolute rampage 😆
As a Kelly… I am crying.
as a gay who never was given a barbie, weirdly was allowed to have bratz (a season after my sis and girl cousins but whatever)... inclusivity! and i loved how relatable the brown girl with a beauty mark was (not using her name -yasmin- coz i guess u dgaf) and yes the weasel and kelly were weird af. so yeah glad u like bratz more, whoever u are, kind sir =]
you really expect me to buy your merch after you skipped my extra greeting?? now way man
Lmao my parents didn’t like me watching bratz when I was younger bc they said they acted like brats........... like tHaTs tHe wHoLe pOInT
that one time every few weeks that kurtis danny & drew upload is the best
i am going to make 🎶 Rapunzel is bald now🎶 my ringtone.
＼(^-^)／
The Bratz cartoon was my childhood. 💜
#6 ON TRENDING KURTISTOWN SUPERIORITY
Guys Kurtis is indeed a virgin.
#2 holy shit
Ok but we all know monster high dolls are superior to both
Congrats on trending, king 😩
Did this man just say...flying unicorns?.......I could forgive the no extra greeting but KURTIS THEY'RE CALLED A HORNED PEGASUS YOU FUCKING DONUT
Kurtis didn't give us an extra greeting because its punishment for calling him a virgin
What a video title
VRG: Very Really GVirgin  Ok?????? Thanks
This is monster high erasure and I will not stand for it
OMMG YOURE OM TEDNDINFG TRWNDING OMMMMGGGG
#JUSTICEFORVISHALJOOD
*"Does thou carpets match thy drapes?"*
Literally bratz is superior than Barbie idc
C'mon now .... SOMEONE else had to be obsessed with MyScene dolls even more than Barbie or Bratz! Just me?? ,😩
i hated bratz- i was a young girl when they were popular and they are so ugly-
idk why but i never got into dolls. i only played with lps and sometimes webkinz
you gotta watch the myscene movie with Lindsey Lohan because that is a cinematic masterpiece
You have to do another one of these
#2 on trending my guy, good work
The best dolls were My Scene💅🏼
i like this
one time i wanted to get a Bratz doll set from the store (i wanted the small accessories for my littlest pet shops) but my grandpa wouldnt let me have it because i was "not a brat". Barbie was ok tho. looking back on it, i think he just didnt like how "provocative" they were compared to Barbie
https://youtu.be/5Qf5nnAEFHs
This is cool and all but Monster High definitely trumps both Barbie and Bratz 🙄
No second greeting? This is a scam, unfollowing /j
Bratz✨ has all been the shit dude !
As a kid, I wanted those pixie glasses so bad it made me SICK
Unsubscribing bc I didn’t get an extra greeting
Theres a reason why you became the mayor of kurtis town
I totally forgot my sisters had an autism fit over the Barbie movie until the fucking paintbrush scene
oke, i think the barbie movies were just perfect, bc it only cared for “the female gaze” but as a doll, bratz are waay cooler. their outfits ? slapped. the bratz cinematic universe ? also really cool, but not as cool as the barbie movies (almost, but not quite)
18:30 coming from an irish person that is the best irish accent from a movie ive ever seen. well done bratz movie.
We didn't get the extra greeting on purpose :(
you look like a hockey players in the 1980s
I completely forgot that Barbie rapunzel movie existed until I saw Kelly and her ugly face and it unlocked terrible memories
always knew Kurt boy was a Barb
I’m upset there were no mentions of bibble 😂
Hedwig is a girl
Ok but the Bratz Babyz movies are a literal well of content 💀
Barbie Princess and the Pauper is a masterpiece idc what you say
KURTIS ITS NOT A FUCKING “FLYING UNICORN” ITS A PEGASUS GODDAMMIT
Ya hooo da ba yo
The dolls aside, you should watch one of the movies from the barbie renaissance which is not a term people use but I'm going to use it because the movies made from 2005 to 2010 (except the barbie diaries we don't talk about that one) were absolutely FIRE
The tensile strength of Rapunzel's hair is a super power in itself
Kurtis could you do a Monster High and Ever After High movie review? The older cgi ones are pretty scuffed
this might be one of my favorite kurtis videos i thought it couldn't get any funnier and then it did
“i’m not doing the extra greeting this time” *then why am i subscribed???*
team bratz
I haven’t watched the video fully through but if bratz movies don’t win I will cry I grew up watching and loving all bratz movies I would still enjoy watching them all right now.
kurtis, never change.
women do the shit, nothing to do with media. the razors, makeup and body image thing is all from women. if there was no demand there would be none of those things
Thought vrg stood for virgo this whole time slkdfjsldkjf
bratz camp start shine though 10/10
omg review a monster high video next! I used to be obsessed with it more than bratz
I was the kid who played with the littlest pet shop toy things cause even at a young age I didn’t like people-
"Kelly is horrible to look at" oh boy just WAIT until you see Tika, now that's a nightmare
Kurtis…why? Barbie is so much better than Bratz. Don’t do this
How dare you not do the extra greeting!         I’m still gunna like the video tho…
Why does the garden gnome sound like Chet Hanks lmaoo
Kurtis picked the worse Barbie movie
#2 on Trending???? Is this debate a popular one?
and then theres me thinking about my monster high dolls
My face when when face my when face when extra when my face when greeting face my extra ;^;
I mean, considering MGA made poopsie toys, Mattel making a shitting Barbie ain’t that impossible
What would a KurtisTown theme park look like
Chalk Zone did have an episode with rapunzel too
I loved the barbie movies as a little girl, and this one was one of my favorites along with Swan Lake and Princess and the Pauper. It is very bizarre as an adult, but omg I loved it as a kid
bratz is superior
I love this video but I have been robbed of my extra greeting. your taking away my American entitlement!
that moustache + the lack of the extra greeting is making me rage
#KurtisConnerisavirginparty
nah nah nah hold up .. Barbie's superior to brats .. without a doubt any day
That Barbie as Rapunzel film I had it in video as a child and I even had the Barbie doll. I felt so complete and in love with it.
“Does thou carpet match thy drapes”  I’m using that as my yearbook quote.
The weasel sounds like idubbbz
For some reason when I was a kid I thought that the king and Rapunzel's dad were brothers so I really never bothered to watch this movie again because in my mind Rapunzel and what's-his-name were cousins 💀
bratz fashion pixiez was everything to me as a child<3
Im unsubscribing 😐☝️☝️☝️ where is the extra greeting 🥺😔😔😭😭
for the rapunzel hair thing if we go off tangled they estimated her hair to be i think at least 70 pounds if not more so we can just assume that rapunzel’s skull has gorilla grip on her hair follicles and the strongest neck ever
british rabbit hobi?
PLEASE watch the live action Bratz movie!!! It's so deserving of commentary pls plss plssssss oh my god
Honestly hope that he will review more Barbie movies in the future, there’s so many creepy and weird character designs in those movies, I feel like he could make an entire video about just them
the barbie movie was literally my favorite movie as a kid
The editing on this video had me dying
one of your most unhinged and fantastic videos ever. highest jokes-per-capita ratio of all time methinks. just fantastic stuff
the absolute fucking Barbie movie SLANDER, is expected bc u haven’t seen 12 dancing princesses which SLAPS— anyway do the my scene girl cartoons now
I watched Barbie and had so many Barbie doll as a kid but I still admired BRATZ more. They’re cooler.
the bratz kids sleepover adventure movie literally slaps so hard
You chose the worst movies to review lmao. I love this tho... guess you just need a part 2 tbh
"ya hooo da ba yo"
lena = nancy from The Craft
Bruh bibble would have changed your mind. Barbie would have won. This was sabotaged. I’m mad.
kurtis why didn’t you compare the barbie fairy movie? confusing bro. missed opportunity
21:27
18:20 why is that actually scary wut
As a kid I watched areound 30 Barbie movies (I counted them now lol), some of them even more than 3 times, and I only now realize how SHITTY the CGI is I'm so sad rn 😞
bratz have better fashion and are inclusive but the barbie movies and the lessons you'll always get and learn from them is the reason why barbie remains superior and iconic.
Bratz supremacy
this video is an EXPERIENCE
I don't really think that Barbie or Bratz is better. When I was a kid and now, I love them both. It's just what you're looking for.
i dont remeber the animation being that bad💀
A Barbie vs. Bratz Kurtis video was not what I expected to be #2 on trending today
kurt u like watched one of the worst barbie movies. rip to kurt he would have loved the ogre in barbie and the magic of the pegasus :(
only 10 min in so far, just had to pause and say that the chalk zone reference brought me way the fuck back
I liked your mustache human
The love interest in the Barbie movie is her long lost brother then???
Kurtis ur really cute  ily xoxo 💋
You should have watched Barbie and the Nutcracker! Lol .. That one is so good!
do i wanna gnome, what happens when this gnome catches up to me
Not kidding, this is one of the funniest videos I have ever seen
Oh kurtis is making a video about Barbie vs bratz? Ok I’ll watch
KURTIS #2 ON TRENDING WTF
how dare you not give us that extra greeting 😡 unsubscribing! /j
I USED TO BE OBSESSED WITH EVERY BARBIE MOVIE I HAD THEM ALL THIS WAS LITERALLY ONE OF MY FAVOURITES SHIASJS WHY DIDNT I REALIZE I THOUGHT THEH WERE GOOD LAST WEEK
hol up are the fighting kings brothers? cuz wouldn’t that mean barbie is pulling an Alabama by going for her cousin
i have never clicked so fast i love classic barbie
hEdWiG wAs A gIRl
Damn now I gotta Gina a new topic 😭 but it’s bratz all day 🤟🏽
Whenever I listen to “do I wanna know” I’m gonna sing “do I wanna gnome”
Barbie saying "Balls" is the final part of my life, thank you
great job on this video honestly wow
Omg my little sister has tons of barbie movie dvds including this one and every time I see her watching one I cringe.
Let’s just say I follow Bratz not Barbie on Instagram ☝🏻😭😩
Good joke today
That word curtain is pretty rough.
doth thou carpets match thy drapes literally killed me, I am dead, commenting as a ghost
This is so upsetting. I remember this Barbie movie as such a good film. The fact it looks like that? And the fact that the painting scenes aren't the main parts of the film? Memories are fucking lies and I don't know what to trust anymore. I preferred living in my fantasy land thinking that the Barbie movies would hold up even all these years later. Fuck.
13:18 yeah this is how I’m ruining everyone’s summer this year
I would like for you to watch the cinematic masterpiece MyScene Jammin in Jamaica
WAS THAT THE GREENDALE FLAG?!?
Next,  Winx Vs. Monster High
Krutis
kurtis lowkey highkey lowkey looking like he shouldn't be talking about barbie and bratz xD
Life in the Dreamhouse is amazing. That is all.
brats>>>>>
KURTIS LMFAO
“brianna’s friends” SIR they are the BRATZZZZZ
Its weird how much I remember the Brats movie
This was such a fun video, I would be super into this as a series. Some of the Barbie and Bratz movies get even more buckwild.
I always liked bratz more, I'm black so having dolls that were actually brown and not some blonde white girl was kinda special to me. I know there are black barbie dolls but unlike some of the bratz dolls they aren't the face of barbie
damn featured king
barbie movies shoulvdve won
I'm filing a cease and desist so you can never say "cease and assist" again
bro u can’t even put bratz up against barbie 🤚🏼 barbie already won
its virg
good lord fan service
I really needed that extra greeting today… but I’m not mad just.. DISGUSTED! You loser virgin… WTF! 🤬😭😩
ya hooo da ba yo
the fact that Kurtis chose the greatest barbie is really amazing, this is my extra greeting
Therapist: Bald Kurtis isn’t real he can’t hurt you Bald Kurtis: RAPUNZEL IS BALD NOW
KURTIS I CAME BACK CAUSE IM GETTING BARBIE ADVERTIESMENTS WTH
I laughed this entire video
Occupy Kurtis town
15:54 "Dylan walked so E-boys could run their fingers through their hair" I just died after that
I always preferred bratz over Barbie as a kid
Chalk Zone was a DEEP CUT my guy
the only reason i liked barbie more as a child was because it unnerved me that bratz dolls feet came off lol
I wont lie, the "Do I wanna gnome?" joke caught me WAY off guard and I almost choked on my beer.
im unsubscribing; i subscribed for an extra greeting so i should get one. saying that “i should be the one in control here” fixes nothing. its like you sign up for a shop’s newsletter to get thirty percent off your first order, but they dont give you the discount because “they want to be in control”.
THANK YOU, MAYOR KURTIS
I laughed so much that I have abs now. thank you kurtis conner, you did what thousands of workouts videos couldn’t.
kurtis i subscribed solely for the extra greeting at the beginning of every video where is it?
Wahahaha! This was a great video. Between the horny weasel and the angry twerking, I was dying laughing.  🤣🤣🤣
Okay but make a versus between the Bratz Halloween film and Barbie and the ballerinas. Hands down the best movies of both franchises.
I grew up watching all the barbie movies and now I have depression
Holy SHIT he didnt give me the extraq greetiing I ufckign" hate  yoU!
i thought this was barbie vs BARBS
Worst mayor ever. Doesn’t keep his promise to give me an extra greeting. Twice.
22:33- “this is just not realistic okay” ummm kurtis why don’t you take a step back from that statement and reflect on the plot of the movie for a second, I think you might retract that statement.
Um, isn't Brats what girls want to look like right now?
I ordered the hoodie the other day and I'm so excited ( ╹▽╹ )
Uh oh not the *w e a s e l*
This video got my friend so excited because she LOVES the Barbie movies AND Kurtis. The motif of the video popped up while we were at school and she said “I think I’m about to cry bro”. I gotta check upon her now
So I’m on my break trying to casually watch this video while sitting next to a coworker but almost lost my shit when he was talking about kelly 😂😂 can’t even finish it now
as a girl who grew up in Turkey, I never related to Barbie. Not only did i not look like any of the characters but none of my friends did either. bratz was the only series i could see girls in my skin complexion while being very fashionable.  so i could both relate to the characters and see powerful female protagonists who were unashamedly feminine. (btw congratulations on #1 on trending)
Kurtis she has her hair wrapped and tied around the pillar so that it isn’t pulling directly on her head
Why does kelly look like JoJo Siwa
I died @ “scrotum scrolls” omg 😂 6:58
this but a series. or just watch bratz movies and review them as a series
i'm so amazed how i remember this movie so well it's making me feel some time of way watching this rn
ya hoo da ba yo
Uh excuse me but those "flying unicorns" are called alicorns.   Lol XP
That first segment made me really disappointed in y'all. Out here really calling Kurtis a vigrin, like real people know this guy fucks.
i cant fucking believe he didnt do barbie mariposa. now that’s a movie with class
VRG = Virgin
“I AM NOT A VIRGIN - ALSO TODAY’S TOPIC IS DOLLS” *number one on trending*
kurtboy you really chose the worst barbie movie in existence
i feel like the only barbie that's better then any Bratz movie is Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper
I love how this is so random but is #1 on trending😭
Can't believe kurt got 1 on trending.
when ur name is kelly
You kill me every time 🤣 I havnt cackled that loud in so long ahaha LOVE YOU KURTIS
The video was so funny that I forgot he didn't give us the extra greeting
people call me rapunzel alot and let me say, THEY PULL ON MY HAIR SO MUCH IT HURTS LIKE A B*TCH HOW DOES RAPUNZEL DO THAT?!
Bratz forever diamond vs 12 dancing princesses is good
Aye. My guy got #1 on trending
As a new subscriber, I will miss the extra greeting. But I get it. And it’s great! Love it for you!
You should watch the bratz movie where they’re in Paris for fashion week or whatever and SPOILER one of the models literally kidnapped one of them and .. stole their youth???? Made them old??? Idk but it’s stuck with me for years ptsd
i want my money back. give me my extra greeting 😡😡
👇👇👇👇 https://youtu.be/xbedGOIsI-o
Anyone else had a huge crush on Lina as a kid? That was my gay awakening
I am crying laughing. The video is so well done and thought-out, as always we can see you've put a lot of work into it :) Love you Kurtis, your videos are the highlight of my week<3
I really missed my extra greeting…but I accept that you decided to not give an extra greeting to us…but I missed it…🥲
FASHION PIXIES IS SO ICONIC
out of all bratz movies you have to go with fashion pixiez lolll
not the scrotum scrolls!
I've been laughing at the gnome speaking for 10 mins also plz now look at my scene movies
ok but u gotta watch barbie life in the dream house on netflix cause it’s actually so funny
Great vid Kurtis!
Love the sneez
ok but u gotta watch barbie life in the dream house on netflix cause it’s actually so funny
This is the second most iconic movie after Barbie swan lake
"so no headwig" is the best joke you've ever written
My comfort YouTuber and comfort childhood movies?? 🤩
Jesus is what we all  need. Turn to Him now, surrender to Him now before the storm comes because A STORM IS SURELY COMING. Talk to Him now from your whole being, your whole heart and see. A STORM IS COMING. In the very near future when MILLIONS go missing, KNOW that it WAS NOT ALIENS. I REPEAT, NOT ALIENS. IT WAS OUR LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST COMING TO TAKE HIS CHURCH HOME. If you do not believe by then, you will be in the storm and it is then that you should repent and accept Christ Jesus as your Lord and Savior for denying Him has a price far worse than death. REVELATION 2:10. We are out of time. Hear these words, what you need/want right now and always is CHRIST. You need Jesus now more than you know, if you do not walk with Him yet. Consider watching my videos where I explain this in the best simplest way I can with pictures and drawings, etc. God bless. I do not want you all to endure the storm. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE THERE. ACCEPT THE SALVATION WHILE THERE IS TIME. There is time after the storm has started to accept the Salvation but it won't be the easier path. Make the smarter choice, you all. You don't need to be in the trouble and even further you don't need to be in hell. It's a real place and there is only one Way back home, Yeshua. I say this In Christ Name. Make your choice now. A STORM IS COMING. TIME IS UP.
You picked my favorites from both. Very really good lol
But- greeting.. ;-; i feel personally attacked
26:23 😔✌️
Why didn’t Kurtis pick the 12 dancing princesses>:(
jason voorhees: 0 _ 0
Bratz are literally my childhood , loved the movies and the dolls so much
#1 on trending baby
kurtis... you should have watched barbie and the diamond castle... top tier barbie movie.
you need to watch brats kids sleepover adventure. that fuelled my nightmares as a kid
The Bratz movie is exactly like Barbie fairy princess or whatever it's called
I will not stand by this Kelly heresy!
24:54 is going to be the next ‘fishy fishy, makin it stinkyy’
bratz, barbie, monster high, and ever after high collectively had a hold on me in my childhood
So we just aren’t doing extra greetings anymore?
a dude with an ugly ass moustache talking about barbie and bratz for almost half an hour helped me cure my depression
👨
There are much better Barbie movies and that’s definitely the best bratz movie in my opinion. Maybe he should watch another Barbie movie 🤔
the bratz section had me cough laughing
Dude I seriously love your look! The hair and mustache work so well idk how you pull it off so nicely it’s awesome
Princess charm school is elite tho
really upset that kurtis didnt pick the best barbie movie to ever exist — barbie in a princess and the pauper
If the song "I'm a barbie girl" isn't mentioned at least once, I'm gonna be mad
This as a series is all I want, The Princess and the Pauper vs Bratz Rock Angelz needs to be reviewed. I need your opinion
Ok but Barbie Princess and the Pauper would go undefeated
Never thought I’d see kurtis review barbie as rapunzel……
As a person who knows more about dolls than the average human, this video is amazing
I know you grew that mustache just to make me personally uncomfortable.
7:17 just made me think of SECRET TUNNEL, SECRET TUNNEL THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN ⛰  ATLA people where you at?
IM SAD WITH NO EXTRA GREETINGS
Kurtis should review another Barbie and Bratz movie. I vote for the rockstar bratz movie that one is litty
this is so satisfying as a bratz girl 💀
Hey bestie, you might want to get a covid test. Because obviously you've lost your taste if you only gave Barbie 4/10.
Okay but do y’all remember the 2D Bratz movie where they are prepping for prom but Yasmin was spying on the girls for the high schools gossip column and they had to make a group project?!
barbie rapunzel's hair is not even that long wth
The absolute lack of taste for choosing bratz over barbie. Still love you but that just wasnt it
immediately one of the funniest videos
"Dylan walked so eboys could run their fingers through their hair" lol that phrase was smooth and tru
Bratz feels like a commentary on drugs
This was so funny. I need a compilation of all the times Kurtis has done some goofy ass dance bc that shit made me laugh waaay too hard
" barbie vs bratz " just like a straight man to try and pit the gays against eachother 🙄😒
How could you forget monster high and the monster high movies top tier
no extra greeting??? i'm unsubscribing
I was team Barbie aaaall my childhood, I had like 40 of them at one point and I feel like it definitely defined me as the  adult I am now. I don't look nowhere near as good as barbie does lol but I feel like my obsession with clothes and shoes comes from there. Also all my barbies went to university so it was something that I never questioned if I had to do it too, I just did it. I guess I'm grateful for that. Sadly, much like Andy's sister in toy story, when I grew up and as we moved from rented house to rented house, I ended up losing them and now I don't have any Barbie left... I would give anything to get them back!! I can't even remember the models that I had except for one or two..
Bratz and monster high dolls is where the diversity is at
I DID A DOUBLE TAKE TO REALIZE THE SHADE YOU THREW AT J*MES
Hey Kurtis! Happy Juneteenth! I love you, Danny and Drew! When are you guys gonna go on tour together again. Also, do you think you'll ever have a stop in Roanoke, VA?
I couldn’t stop laughing at the angry twerking
I thought that the Bratz looked freakish next to the other characters because their features were so exaggerated by comparison. At least Barbie looked like she was from the same movie as everyone else around her.
this video is perfect
Is it 500$? Or 5000?$
PLEASE WATCH GNOMEO AND JULIET THE CAST IS AMAZING AND THE HIDDEN SHAKESPEARE LINES ARE AMAZING
I feel sick without my extra greeting 😔
kurtis tackling real issues here
„Dylan walked so eboys could run their fingers through their hair“ is a master class sentence. Just 😘🤌🏻 chefs kiss
Barbie dolls should be named barbie Balls
how could you leave out my scene dolls! they had a movie too and games on the dvd that I played for way too long
should have watched barbie in the princess and the pauper mate
THIS IS THE CONTENT I NEEDED 🥰
I liked the barbie movies more as a kid but definitely was obsessed with the Bratz dolls cos they looked like me lol
I remember only having barbies even though I didn’t really like them. And I went to a cousins house for the first time and I was so shocked that there were brown dolls.
KURTIS WHERE IS THE EXTRA GREETING?????
Barbie mariposa would have been a way better choice
not kurtis calling gothel a simp when he has 94 on his merch💁🏻‍♀️ kurtis we know👀
Hopefully your merch is still stocked up in july im gonna buy it 😩☝️
do i wanna gnome if this gardens incomplete just to go to looowwes they got red boots on their feet
Barbie for movies. Bratz for cute af outfits. Both iconic. U.U girls vs girls? Girls support girls 👍
if you wouldve said barbie was better than bratz i wouldve thrown hands, but im glad we can agree
Kurtis why is there no extra greeting this time why do you have to do us dirty like that :(
Kurtis I'm sorry but you kinda look like the Weasel...
i’m heartbroken about the lack of extra greeting 💔💔💔
The dance moves in this movie though😏
The mustache is giving you too much power
Wow I thought Chalk Zone was a fever dream.
****weasel voice****kurtis I love how versatile you are ***uhhhhh****lmfao 😂😂😂😂
Yesss bratz is everything 😘☺️☺️😍😌🙂😂😂😍🥲🥲😙😂🤨😅😛😂😛🤨😜🥰😀😀😇😄😌🤪🤨💇‍♂️🤦‍♀️🙎‍♂️💇‍♀️🤦🧖‍♀️🤦‍♀️💆‍♀️🙆🙍🙋‍♀️🧏‍♂️
Ya hooo da ba yo
14:32 My perfectly fine breathing left the chat...
Barbie themepark!
Scrolltum
dude i love this man
I played with both but my Bratz dolls were *chefs kiss* the movies and show were my favorite
Bratz and Groovy Girls were my shit.
Kurtis needs to watch Princess and the Pauper every Barbie fan will tell you that’s the best one
PETITION FOR MORE BARBIE/BRATZ SERIES LETS GO
please monster high next please kurtis please i beg of you my hetero king please monster high next. 🙏
“Mattel me that” ...
Sighorney Weasler
First I saw Trisha Paytas preparing food for Mac DeMarco on frenemies, and now this video... I am fully convinced we’re living in a simulation and that there’s no such thing as a coincidence
Alright kurtis, im calling the police, I didn’t get my extra greeting.
my dad never let me have bratz dolls because he thought it would make me a brat or something
Listen I appreciate the sentiment of “I’m not what I create” however if you’re going to say that never forget that people like Shane Dawson exist on this platform. Although this isn’t the same thing, saying that is essentially like “Hur dur separate da art from da artist” when if someone creates racist shit, I won’t, because that harms people. Just maybe word it better? Again, I love your content and I understand what your trying to say. It just comes across a little OOF.
"grab a water" please mayor stop asking us to do physically and grammatically imposible tasks
#cancelkurtis2021
1:25 COALLING OAL BARBZZ
Bratz are the best made fashion doll for kids, ever. The clothes are beautifully made and inclusive of a lot of influences
BARBIES ARE ELITE!!!!!!!! The movies slap! I’ve watched all of them. And they never get old. Bratz are pretty good. The movie scared the shit out of me when it was that creepy carnival. And at the sleepover. BUT HEY. The talking dog was……. Ok I guess? But nah in all seriousness the bratz are really pretty as well. And they are both good. BUT BARBIE MOVIES ARE ELITE. KURTIS REACT TO THE SCARY STORIES SLEEPOVER ADVENTURE BRATZ DOLL MOVIE. MAKE A PART TWO, AND FOR THE OTHER BARBIE MOVIE DO FAIRYTOPIA MERMAIDIA PLEASE IT IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES!!!!! 💖
I don’t remember if I preferred barbies or brats but I never ripped a brats head off and I ripped multiple barbies heads off. I literally cut their hair off, decapitated them, then tried twisting their limbs off. Then I just left them at the bottom of my Barbie bucket ☠️. I also kept their hair in my jewelry box along with my hair that I also cut off myself lmaoo
okay hi. about that hair thing with rapunzel, if she looped her hair first to a pole then let down hair then that wouldn't hurt. the force from the prince climbing is applied  to the pole so rapunzel wouldn't get hurt from it.   (just wanted to inform lol y'all)
If I dont get my extra Greeting then unsubscribed!!!!!!.... jk but that did make me sad
i was told that if i subscribe i get an extra greeting  unsubscribing
“rapunzal is bald now” shrek the third anybody?
why would you choose the rapunzel movie  there are so many better ones  also barbie movies are better but bratz dolls are better than the barbie dolls bc they are more inclusive
The only Bratz movie I remember is the Bratz Babies one where they're superheroes. Anyway the Barbie movies are better, don't @ me.
I thought that pixie brats movie was a fever dream I had as a kid because there was no way there was an actual movie that had the Mum turn into a fucking tree during a storm ☠️ I was wrong
The AM reference made my day 😭
Ok but y’all can’t deny that Bratz had the better fashion sense 🙄✋
shouldve picked barbie princess and the pauper its the best one by far
Y’all got the wrong idea monster high was where it was at
I have returned to Kurtis town from my first six months in the army just to get a fuck you to my extra greetings 😔
Dude I have a dvd of that Barbie movie I used to watch it all the time as a kid
Bratz rock angels was the superior Bratz movie ❤️
I was looking for more Kurtis Content literally when he uploaded fuck yeah
for someone who had knee length hair, if you pick up the hair and tug so the tension doesn't land on the roots, but in the bend of the hair, it doesn't hurt
Barbies Rapunzel is a direct rip off of Cinderella. Especially in the beginning. Used to love that shit as a kid
Jesus, the Barbie movies graphics didn't age well. I always saw them as extremely good but now I see the clip from Rapunzel and it looks so bad. The movies are still great.
The Barbie Stans demand a rematch but with Barbie in the Princess and the pauper😤
Barie and Bratz are fine but Monster High forever.
Huh, Kurtis thinks him not doing his extra greeting can hurt me? Well, he is certainly funny. Haha yes, how can that make me upset? Oh boy this guy’s funny… Right? Yeah….    that doesnt hurt us.  ok, it does. KURTIS DO THE EXTRA INTRO NOW. thanks
Why did every time a white boy bratz doll danced/kurtis dances I go “GO WHITE BOY GO”
DOES THY CURTAINS MATCH THY DRAPES
Kurtis should have watched the Diamond Castle, turns all the girls gay.
The editing on this video is CHAOTIC
Damn I fucks with this hair...
kelly sheridan 4ever
That brats movie was my absolute favorite one
CHALK ZONE WENT HARD SJSJSJHSSHHS
I love how Brianna just has the bi flag as her eyeshadow
I need Kurtis to go through all the barbie and bratz movies asap
please kurtis please Monster High movies please omg my goshdarn childhood man pleas e oh gos plea monster high ah sheeee monster high
Kurtis did you go into my brain because I dreamt this entire video like 2 weeks ago.
YES YES YES A NEW VIDEO HAPPINESS IS BACK
I would kill for some Barbie or Bratz movie commentaries from this guy lmao
allow me mistress
I owned that Bratz motorcycle as a kid
*I dunno, man, the 'stache screams "VIRGIN" at the top of its lungs.* 😬
The Barbie and Bratz movies, my childhood 😩💔
The irony of my little sister watching the exact same barbie movie rn.
#kellyslander
Wheres the extra greeting, grrrrr
Day 11 of asking Kurtis to watch Trailer Park Shark 🦈   Thanks for the video mayor Kurtis this one will definitely be one of my go-to’s to watch from now on
The last thing I expected was a commentary on bratz vs barbie, thank you Kurtis, you made me laugh and made my day
This video dredged up so many childhood memories I forgot I had, holy shit
no extra greeting :( unsubscribd
yeah this whole thing gives off massive virgin vibes
Dylan twerking is my new power move 19:34
This video has me in fucking tears right now 💀💀
You are a horrifying creature
thank you for this gift 🥺
My man grew a mustache in the time it took to make this 30 min Barbie vs Bratz review and it was completely worth it 10/10
I’m gonna start a podcast called “virgin with a podcast”
Kurtis you and Danny post at the same time, this is starting to make me think you Drew and Danny are synced in one mind
Well now I need kurtis to watch 'bratz babyz'
Kurtis you uncultured fool a “flying unicorn” is called a PEGASUS
The bratz dolls in the movie look so much cooler than barbie that I'm low key jealous bratz weren't around when i was a kid.  Well they technically were but I was too cool in middle school
oh I thought the letters meant he was a Virgo.
please review ever after high!! they have a series, books and dolls personally i think they’re better than both barbie and bratz haha
i love you ditching your intro! a small beautiful act of power. your content is your own, always in all ways!
Ok it’s official this man is a comedic genius or a comedy god
"you have to be nice to me, it's the law" not without that extra greeting, dude, it's all contingent on the extra greeting.
21:40 - 22:20 funniest thing i've seen in awhile
if gnomes r fire hydrants and u need glasses to c em does that mean they were being chased by a fire hydrant??? and rode a horse with a fuck ton of fire hydrants???
Watch the monster high movies next they are honestly amazing and have good plots (better than barbie and bratz imo)
ngl kurtis kinda look like dylan
My lil ponies vs care bears
i love me some 'mid-20 dude talk about bratz and barbie'
He knows his audience 💀
seeing one of my fav youtubers rate a baby movie that 9 year old me based my entire personality on gives me a very complete feeling
this is your funniest video i loved it
I don't know dude, *Do I Wanna Gnome?* is very overrated in my opinion.  Like Humbug is>>>
i'm cancelling kurtis for his chipped nailpolish
why does dylan look like levi ackerman
Not giving an extra greeting was a virgin move kurtis
Finally a topic I can get around
I would disagree that a chase scene without music doesn’t work. A lack of music can ad tensions to some moments. The one is Barbie blew tho
Pixie glasses is just experiencing LSD for the first time
Is no one talking about how he purposely didn’t give us and extra greeting #kurtisisoverparty
kurtis please watch the barbie diaries i am begging you
the james charles apology ref😭
The gnome chase scene is singlehandedly the funniest thing I have ever seen in my LIFE
this video was really good!!
Brazilian dub of barbie movies is another level of artistry. I swearrrrrrrr The horny pet, at a time, says in a Carioca accent: GET HER, FRY HER, MAKE STEW WITH HER!!!
hey man, thanks for dropping the second greeting. you do you, always. great content once again :)
Ya hooo da ba yo
The weasel reminds me of hisoka 🏃‍♂️
We really watching a commentary of a Barbie and Bratz movie? That’s how you know this guy has clout. Ppl will watch literally anything he produces. Crazy
The way I immediately clicked on this 🤣
I was promised an extra greeting 🥺
Ya hooo da ba yo
It would be fascinating to see Kurtis watch the Fairytopia movies. Still got weird ass designs but wondering if Kurtis and bibble would vibe  Fairytopia and mermadia are some of the best Barbie movies fr tho. Designs are defiantly better (except for the turtle that forever haunts me in my sleep)
That’s why Danny and Drew don’t have podcasts, they’re little loser virgins.
wtf wtf no extra greeting what kurbip I can’t do this
ya hooo da ba yo
Fun Fact: Lina is Dee's sister, which makes her the aunt of Cymbeline and Breeana
Man I wish he picked Bratz Rock Angelz cuz that is an ICONIC movie
it feels wrong to not receive an extra greeting
Shoulda watched Magic of the Pegasus
The weasel stole the show👏🏽
The fact that you didn’t watch Rock Angels skewed the results
28:46 bless you
As a kid I watched both and both I loved lol
i love your videos kkkkkkkk they're so funny because they're like so fucking not funny. that they're funny!!!!! suhuahsuahsuhaushau i love it
I live for Kurtis copying this many dances in one video
everyone ignoring the “do thy carpets match the drapes” joke 💀
What if, and hear me out, we got a sequel to this video with 2 more movies from each franchise?
Kurtis Conner thinks he can just skip the Extra Greeting -_-
the newer barbie movies are v good okay
That barbie movie was my favorite when I was little. how dare you give it a 4/10, kurtis 😡
HAGAHSHDHSKAJAUSBSBD DO I WANNA GNOME
Kabeesh kabeesh kabeesh kabeesh kabeesh Kabeesh kabeesh kabeesh kabeesh kabeesh
THE GNOME
18:58 am i too drunk or is he just too extra 😂😂😭😭💀
You look like you're selling candy in your van
Kurtis you chose one of the worst Barbie movies…
whyyyy u didnt do the introoo noooooooo
the way you didn't even mention penelopes daddy issues
*throws glass on ground* Fuck the extra greeting
Omg i remember watching that barbie movie when I was little. I also drew a dress on the wall and went in in... Kind of slapped my face on the wall...
I have so many barbie movies from when I was little. I dont have any bratz movies but I did watch many of them on YouTube and Netflix. I also had a bratz doll that came with fake snow
when your favorite youtuber makes a video about your favourite hobby - dolls😭💕
This brought back so many forgotten memories. 😂
Ya hoo da ba yo
okay but if he had watched Fairytopia or Mermaidia (obviously the superior Barbie movies), Barbie would've won 🙄
Very chad to use the pic of Sigourney Weaver from holes, the best movie ever made
please make this into a series pls
bratz will forever be better than barbie tbh
The best part of kurtis’ videos is him reacting to his own bad dad jokes.
eagerly awaiting part 2 🙏🏽
ok next disney vs. nickelodeon
15:29 I thought it was going to be simile and metaphor. When he said Rihanna i was like WHAT!!???
speaking as someone who hyperfixated on bratz movies as a child (especially this specific movie), there is no bratz movie that could ever hope to compete with barbie princess and the pauper
Now we need Kurtis to watch a monster high movie 😭😭
No extra greeting I’m unsubbing
Oh Kurtis you GOTTA watch Barbie Swan Lake and Bratz Genie Magic!! Iconic films from my childhood
At the start of the video how you talked are you a PC Feminist?
DO THY CARPETS MATCH THY DRAPES
LMAOOOO THE WEASEL MOAN OVER STEFAN
I'm the hair thing, I really like how tangled did it, cause she used a hook as a pulley system which would I'm theory take the tension off her head and neck
amazing video but ur cancelled
At this point kurtis has failed me twice what’s the point of being subscribed because I didn’t even get an extra greeting and that was like the main selling point
Bratz all the way baby!!!!
Watch bratz super babies 😂😂😂 it’s funny
I deadass got a barbie ad in this video. This has been my first Barbie ad ever on youtube
"THEY UNFORTUNATELY SAVED HER LIFE"  All kelly does is exist and kurtis took it personally
I love this video. It disappointed me that Kurtis choose the least gay of the Barbie movies though.
I’ve probably watched the Barbie movie so many times as a child that every scene is SEARED into my mind
ARE YOU JOKING BARBIE MOVIES ALL THE WAY
how dare u not give me my extra greeting, kurtis? i thought kurtistown was the best place to live. was i wrong, kurtis?
i support the no extra greeting, u can see in ur eyes u haven't meant it for months anyway lmao you do you king
new fav kurtis video - i laughed so much all the way thru
if no extra greeting why subscribe kurtis explain that
WHERES MY EXTRA GREETING KURTIS
Bratz was one of my lesbian awkenings
Ya hoo ya bo li doo yaaa
Kurtis!! You didnt notice but Penelope couldn't break Rapunzel out cause she was afraid of heights and that was her big character arc with her dad the bigger dragon. Obvi
wtf that bratz movie brought back some memories i didn’t even know I had
While I respect your decision not to give us an extra greeting. Im sad you didnt.
One of the funniest videos I've seen. I really laughed so hard hahah and your jokes are getting better and better hahahh
Fashion fairy's was my favorite one omg
omg the way you unlocked a core memory with that barbie movie wowwww
stop i thought this was about barbz
Why didn't you watch the Barbie an the Nutcracker it's a Classic ? You watched the wrong one 🤣
THE JAMES CHARLES DISS I WAS LAUGHING SO HARD
yeah ur cancelled buddy 🤨🤨
that’s a ferret kurtis
No extra greeting ? Unsubbed
Thank for bless, lord conner.
Something about this Barbie movie represents 2001 perfectly (besides the pixies of course)
Nooo you should have picked Bratz Rock Angelz :/
Day 1 of asking kurtis to react to weirdly sexual Reese’s ads
_"Rapunzel is bald now"_  this little song will be in my mind for probably 2 months now, it's too good kinda lounds like a one direction song too lmao
I preferred the monster high dolls when I was younger. The Bratz dolls scared me.
I watched Barbie movies to an embarrassingly late age but also in defense the animation didn’t look as bad when I was 5 lol
ya hooo da ba yo
give greet i am sad
“Could a Virgin do a podcast?” I mean…. I could try
you have to watch bratz rock angelz,  its the best!
I remember watching the Bratz movie as a kid but the gnome being Irish threw me off so much he sounds like my uncle
Lol I was such a big bratz fan when i was younger
make moustache go away
Kurtiiiiis how could you forget that Penelope was afraid of heights that’s why she couldn’t fly.... or wait was she just bad at breathing fire? I think she was just a bad dragon in general there was even a scene with her disappointed dad
So dogs just like to pee on garden gnomes? That's kinda kinky, but I'm all for it.
This mans comparing the best bratz movie to an eh Barbie movie, WATCH PRINCESS AND THE PAUPER
Alot of parents when I was younger wouldnt let their kids play with Bratz because they didnt like the "Attitude" branding? Like they didnt want their kids to be "bratty" and try and dress like them and it was a common thing I had heard  from friends back then so we all just moved from dolls to Littlest Pet Shop. I think there were only 2 girls we knew who had bratz and we would all just play with everything together or just take the clothes from the bratz and try to force them on Barbies? But bratz have their own issues when it comes to body inclusivity themselves so idk it just depended who had what but noone really thought deep about the toys we played with whichever we thought was pretty is what we got
barbie would have won if it was princess and the pauper
I dont know if they were a big line or what but there was a line of knock off (i guess?) barbie x bratz fusion dolls that i loved the most. They were barbie sized and fit barbie clothes but they had the big features and diverse skin tones that bratz had. My favourite was the blond one and i made her be the bitchy one lmao and then i had a darker one who had long her to her knees with a red streak in and she’d always be the sweet one. Loved those dolls
THIS LEGIT MADE MY DAY LMAO
i love kurtis movie reviews can we get a kurtis barbie vs bratz series
Anyone else ya hooo da ba yo???
He's gotta do a Monster High vs. Ever After High now
I saw the title and literally whispered to myself “ *the great debate* ”
barie will always be SUPERIOR but barbie rapunzel doesn't count
Realised my forehead is exactly the same size as Kelly’s aha new insecurity unlocked  😳
Finally, the perfect time to drop this video link 😂 https://youtu.be/22QlTCYeCdY
BARBIE AND A MERMAIDS TAIL WAS SUCH A WHOOPER OF A MOVIE
oh my god its fucking kelly
the fact that you didn’t call them “scrolltums” makes me upset
Okay but you should’ve watched rock angelz it’s…….. perfect
i always forget you have to watch these movies all the way through first. kurtis is constantly taking one for the team 😞
I WANT A WHOLE SONG ABOUT “DO I WANNA GNOME?” NOW GIVE IT TO ME GIMME GIMME
1:27 my adhd brain trying to tell a story
Barbie as rapunzel was my first CD I've ever had I used to watch and rewatch it all the time like damn
Ok now THIS is the video I've been waiting for since I was in 6th grade
a barbie and a bratz's forbidden love
Dude, my sister and I had all the Bratz dolls when we were kids ..even the boy Bratz dolls. Even though I’m old af now it’s exciting for their come back
I grew up with brats movies like brats sleepover, superhero’s, farytails, fashion pixies, and a few more that I can’t remember. I barely watched any Barbie movies. Oh and to top it all off, my choice of dolls wasn’t Barbie or brats; it was monster high!
genuinely believe that bratz don't know the difference between gnomes and leprechauns and it's so incredibly funny to me
my oldest sister loved bratz and now shes emo and wears demonias so basically shes cool
6:35
i never liked barbie because I felt like she was catered to a single audience, white girls lol. So when bratz came out and I saw the diversity, I was really happy. Even the bratz style is more realistic and cuter imo.
Do barbz vs cardi b stans
Wait….. HE’S BALD!? ITS A WIG!?!
Drop the greeting it's corny
Kurtis are you ok
you NEED to watch the bratz superbabies movie its my childhood fever dream and the villains are literally mutant vegetables from space🧍🏻‍♀️
28:12 “[…] as soon as you press the sub…SCRIbe BUTTOn, you become a valued citizen of kurtis tOOWWWN-ah”
I really liked the chase scene as a kid cause I fuckin loved the sound of footsteps in barbie movies
wow,so people are not even gonna do anything about his NONE EXISTING EXTRA GREETING NOW?!
bald kurtis is something that will now forever haunt my dreams
*likes video aggressively* i am terrified of kelly 🤧
12:13 buried memories unlocked: https://youtu.be/BHkhIjG0DKc
Props to Kurtis for studying hours of preteen girl media for our entertainment
PLAY THE BRATZ AND BARBIE VIDEO GAMES (recommended Bratz Rock Angelz pls n thank u)
🗿
DYLAN. TWERKS. ABOUT. IT. 💀💀💀💀
I loved my Bratz dolls as a kid, never really watched any of the movies (thankfully)
Kurtis you have no idea how many times I've seen that Barbie movie (or any Barbie movie tbh)... this was playing on repeat in my house when I was a kid, thank you for acknowledging this masterpiece
i love this video but it was so funny it made me choke on my risotto so my feelings are ultimately mixed
*Yonekorn*
Aye dude, when international travel is legal again, would you ever do international shows?
you should’ve done the prom bratz movie!!  that was my favorite movie during my childhood
ah yes, barbie rapunzel, one of the most anti-semitic movies ever
I had the entire Barbie Rapunzel set as a kid, but unfortunately it did not include the weasel 😂
I am not a jerk, Kurtis!
6:20 why am I getting an ad right after this about an old lady who’s “in and out of hospital regularly because I’m so sick” 😭
Here I am, thinking life can’t get any fkn worse, and now Kurtis skips out on the extra greeting. I can’t believe u’ve done this
could someone watch my apple juice while i watch the video thanks  🧃
why don’t you compare the best barbie movie and the best bratz movie instead of random
Danny, then Kurtis  *Drew you are next*
Hmm I actually think IF someone had hair like that, it wouldn't hurt if someone climbed it IF it was wrapped around something? Like, if you grab your hair above where you're brushing it, it doesn't hurt either
𝘼𝙉𝙂𝙍𝙔 𝙏𝙒𝙀𝙍𝙆𝙄𝙉𝙂
someone pls make a full version of do i wanna gnome- pls, i need it in my life 😭😭😭
"so no headwig?" might be the best joke ever
I dont know what it is, but something about he way he grabs her at 7:52 makes me feel uneasy.
barbie movies >>>>>>>>> bratz movies
YOU NEED TO WATCH BARBIE MERMAIDIA!!!!!!!! ITS THE BEST ONE OUT THERE 😤😤😤😤
Kurtis you’ve made a big mistake. Huge. Rapunzel? Rapunzel??? How dare you. Barbie’s Princess and the Pauper. Thats the choice you should have made. How dare you. How DARE you.
Team Bratz 👑
id pay to see kurtis review the fairytopia series
I am unsubscribing because I didn’t get a extra greeting 😠
That’s not even the weirdest Barbie movie. You need to see the one with Bibble. That will mess you up
kurtis it's so brave of you to be open about being a virgin and display your pride for your community like that, truly inspiring
okay, but hear me out- MyScene Dolls and Monster High
DOEST THOU CARPETS MATCH THOU DRAPES IM IN TEARS
Please upload a picture of your yard filled with holes for Kelly. There needs to be at least 83,000 of them at this point. You have 12 hours.
There might but be an asshole Barbie but there is totally a toilet training Kelly. 🌟
Barbie princess & the pauper is incredible
My partner would like you to review "Barbie and the Nutcracker" and "bratz rock angelz"   Quote: "They are the best ones".
Kurtis- you don't have to do the extra greeting dude 😄
Wow I can't believe Kurtis reviewed a Barbie movie and didn't even pick the best one 🙄
Kurtis im not hoping u suffer by seeing multiple kellys in ur lifetime But pls make this a series thank u
Why didn't you give me my extra greeting?? I'm crying rn. I need the extra greeting. What am I gonna do now?? Why did you do this???
KURTIS. PENELOPE WAS AFRAID OF FLYING AND HEIGHTS. DID YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE MOVIE AT ALL?
Petition for Kurtis to binge all three fairytopia movies back to back
I don't remember much about the Barbie movies but I do remember that that weasel was my favourite. I'm concerned what that says about me
Lovin' the Caddyshack poster 🤘💜
the fact that chloe, sasha, yasmin, and jade weren't even mentioned by name for the bratz section     also why tf do i remember their names???
cant believe he didnt make a joke abt pixies being on shrooms,, why the fuck were there so many mushrooms in the pixie world😭😭😭
You should add monster high because they deserve it
finally something relevant. a debate worth hearing
I may be a teenage boy but Barbie movies fucking slap
Can this be a series now
OMG literally at the moment when kurtis said "Bar bee" a fucking bee attacked me
I don’t feel so welcome as a returning viewer… give me that extra greeting
ya hooo da ba yo
11:57 me at any party be like
FORGET the other movies, WATCH PRINCESS AND THE PAUPER. ITS THE BESTTTTT ONE. IT HAS A BARKING CAT.
doth thy carpets match thy drapes? 💀💀💀💀
you HAVE to watch bratz sleepover adventure, that movie have me nightmares for years when I was a kid
The pixie glasses just make everything seem like you’re on acid
You should react to Bratz super baby's
The little boy that shoots the arrow looks like chucky
I need more of this, the Bratz tv show is iconic
I fucking love this so much.
The fact that you didn’t review Barbie princess and the pauper is a crime 😭 we need to know your thoughts on Preminger
this whole video feels like a fever dream, dude.
I would 100% watch more of these
You realize you legit just made a video about Barbie and Bratz? Barbie and Bratz, let that sink in. Danny made a very cool and interesting video about the outrageousness of Takis advertisement and this one, Barbie and Bratz. Not like something that we can all relate to like, hot wheels or transformers or g.i. Joes, but fuckin Barbie and Bratz 🤦‍♂️ what in the world were you thinking?
okay so like i now need you to react to the bratz rock angelz and their video game because it was a HUGE part of my childhood
BARBIE > BRATZ  Accept this fact
*in a barbie voice : Sebastian BALLS
The way they had the gnome in bratz say cailínís knowing full well 99.9% of their audience wouldnt know what it meant was such an interesting choice to me but i do love a bilingual king
Dude I was eating you should’ve warned us about Kelly
0:27 that's not funny 😃 unsubscribe
As a barbie movie fan, I'm very offended and will be unsubscribing
There's this miniseries from the 90s called the 10th Kingdom that was my favourite thing ever as a kid and it was based on all these fairytales and at one point the main character's hair grows from a curse and she's stuck in a tower and when another character climbs it, she's screaming and cursing him out because of how much it hurts. It's the only time I've seen it done right!!
i still have all my bratz dolls. i have the party bus too. i loved them.
You look like Justin Bieber
society has surpassed the need for an extra greeting
Me being an Irish person at the gnome scene 👀 d'fuck is this? Lol good voice acting though.
This had the same energy as the eboy era videos, 100/10
So happy to see a bigger creator shouting out a small business! A large creator shouting out a local company like Mattel is so inspiring to see
It’s true. I am a goddamned nightmare to look at. 🤷🏻‍♀️😐
Soon Kurtis will finish his metamorphosis into Joe Dirt and I'm here for it.
You should watch one if the barbie movies it is on a purple disc
kurtis i’m begging you please watch a monster high movie. 13 wishes is the most insane thing i’ve ever watched you’ll love it.
I am sad you didnt review the two best movies from the two franchises, Barbie and The Nutcracker and Bratz: Rock Angels, are the best two imho and would have been a more even playing field
Please do more of these! Trust me there are so many more iconic Bratz and Barbie movies, you barely scratched the surface with these ones!
kurtis must check out barbie diaries
but without an extra greeting why even subscribe??? 😭
this was FANTASTIC. kurt is on a high streak
Can’t believe kurtis didn’t make a i hardly know her joke when he said wood chipper 💀
ya hooo da ba yo
The giant garden gnome is by Kelders farm in upstate NY it’s pretty cool Kurtis should go there sometime since he’s touring around NY
barbie as rapunzel and fashion pixiez are okay but dude: Princess and the Pauper and Bratz: Rock Angelz are THE best
Next video we need two extra greetings now..... I loved the video anyways... But I felt less loved
Please do more of these videos, I’ve seen like all these movies and they only get wilder😂
2:53 IS THAT THE ‘COMMUNITY’ GREENDALE FLAG
4:30 you’re telling me all of that was INTRO!?!?!?.???
Fun fact: When I was young, I was obsessed with Bibble. Bibble is a blue, fluffy possum-like character that appeared in the Barbie Mermaid movie. I saw a clip of the movie recently, and then it occurred to me just how f*cking weird I was for loving Bibble so much.
YA HOO DA BA YO
Therapist: Bald Kurtis isn’t real he can’t hurt you Bald Kurtis: RAPUNZEL IS BALD NOW
Broo, I forgot how funny you were. I've been missing ojt
Me when Kurtis picked Rupunzel for the barbie movie: going with a classic, maybe a little basic but you’re not wrong
Why aren’t you inclusive of big foreheads 🙃
06:16 got me so bad, damn. I watched it like 10 times, dead.
If I remember correctly. Penelope can't really fly so high that's why Rapunzel can't really go anywhere.
Your reasoning for VRG sounds like the dumbest excuse ever. "HAHA! VRG , are you a virgin?! Haha" "uuuuh nooooo that stands for...very...really...good! Yes, very realy good!" "..." "..."
5:10 lmao, that damage control. Curtis knows his audience well😂
"do i wanna gnome" legit made me cry laughing
SOS I’ve been singing rapunzel is bald now for three hours. I had to report back and tell you
Kurtis I'm not asking for much. JUST GIMME LITTLE KURTIS RUNNING AROUND!   JK. Give us little Kurtis anytime you want jsjsjsj
So no Hedwig 💀💀
the weasel’s in heat leave it alone
when I was a kid, i dont think my country sell any bratz dolls that's why i grew up with barbie dolls instead. and because of that i grew up watching those movies. it was the best tbh lol
this is the content that i subscribed for, kurtis
#kurtisoverparty
plot twist the fairy glasses don't let them see the fairy world it just gives them an ac1d tr1p
bratz >>>>>
Unsubbed, the extra greeting cures my depression but now I’m sad.       This is a joke
Dylan is Black 💀💀💀💀💀💀
Well what am I subscribed for if not an extra greeting?
Purposely not giving extra greeting?? In Kurtis Town!!?
kelly is the human manifestation of grug from the croods mixed with Kronos but make it molded into a pet rock that came to life but it’s squishy and it’s covered in old sunflower butter and then got stomped on by the blue meanie who then proceeded to lick the sunflower butter rock off their shoe 😟‼️
I'm not even 2 minutes in and I already have a question. Kurtis, how high were you while filming this 😂
Kurtis your tash is so mighty this morn' congratz
Kurtis how could you
Literally a 2 hour video of Kurtis dancing like a Bratz movie character
My friend had a Bratz car I had a barbie car. Barbie car was generic 2000s purple volvo convertible, wheels didn't turn. Bratz car was a 50s or 7ps design low rider convertible that had a WORKING RADIO. I rest my case
Kurtis I love you
i was never allowed to have bratz :((
You need to watch Barbie princess and the pauper!!!
THE VIDEO I NEEDED - also you need to watch the baby bratz alien movie (think its super babyz), idek how to describe that one
What age should kids watch bratz even a baby can watch barbie  i was never allowed to have bratz :-(
Kurtis: "Could a virgin have a podcast?" EBOYS: "Completed it mate"
The mushrooms that grow during the gnome firehydrant bit are psilocybin mushrooms lol, that entire movie is pumped with drug references. I'm pretty sure the creators of this were having a laugh.
Shave your mustache you look like an egg rolled in a carpet
Really topical considering I just watched “The toys that made us” Barbie and found their entire story. Like seriously it’s really crazy, tax fraud, drugs, overdose, lawsuits it’s crazy.
The Bratz movie came out a solid five years after the Barbie movie, which might make this an unfair comparison since the Bratz movie would most likely have better animation.
i dont get an extra greeting, you dont get a like 😠
Now you have to do Barbie Princess and the Pauper because that's the cream of the crop
I wish the rabbit called Hobi was called J-Hope instead🙂
Is no one gonna mention how at 7:52 the guy grabs barbies WHOLE WAIST with just TWO HANDS
Broooo Bratz were my shit as a lil kid. I was super into the dolls, the movies, the games, etc. Even to this day I genuinely still love the Bratz characters. Even after coming out as a trans guy… I refuse to denounce something that was so special to me as a lil kid. Bratz are just so much fun tbh and I have so many lovely memories of being a lil kid and just RUNNING home to watch the Bratz tv show (which, looking back on it… they were fucking INSANE) only to just wibble on about it with my friend the day after.   I liked barbie too.. but not as much tbh. The movies were fun but nothing would top the Bratz 🥺🥺
2:52 e pluribus anus?
WE NEED TO OVER TRONE KURTIS NOWWW!!!
Imagine watching Barbie as rapunzel when you can watch Barbie princess and the pauper and PREMINGER
“doth thy curtains match thy drapes?”  I- ☠️☠️☠️
Great video! Your face terrifies me, but in like a good way. Keep growing that mullet out kurt meister
PLEASE DO MORE BARBIE AND BRATZ FILMS AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!
I demand a rematch.
ok but kurtis what about bratz feet
I'm just saying monster high dolls used to be super high quality. They had different faces and head shapes, they had wrist joints, elbow joints, knee joints, their arms could twist at the elbow and wrist, their arms didn't just move forward and backwards, you could move them and force them to T-pose. Their legs move in and out a bit, kinda. Their legs twist, their heads move up and down as well as side to side. They were super popular for doll customizing but you can't really buy them from stores anymore. You gotta buy them secondhand.
kurtis i will have to cancel u now
ya hooo da ba yo
I love it when Kurtis ends the video with “one like equals...” and then the weirdest shit ever.
bratz for dolls and barbie for content
I ALWAYS felt weird watching that chase scene in the barbie movie... but my small kid brain couldn't quite realize what was wrong with it
Don’t you mean, “Very Really GAY,” Kurtis? It is pride month after all
14:27 can we address the back of her head in this scene
I feel like kurtis is getting younger and younger over the years
Keely makes me want to spin my head around and throw up on my sister.
19:00 THE JAMES CHARLES TITLE AND PROFILE SENT MEEE
I want Kurtis to become a Barbie movie review channel
Penelope couldn’t fly over the wall because she was afraid of heights! And her friends were understanding of that and didn’t push her! Cmon kurtis, pay attention dude…
YALL NEED TO WATCH BARBIE PRINCESS AND THE PAUPER 😤😤PLS THE SONGS, THE CHARACTERS AND WHO COULD FORGET PREMINGER?? 🥰😩 no but its literally chef’s kiss yall better watch it
JUST LET IT GO NOW FEEL THE GROOVE
Are we gonna skip past “long ass hair”? Cmon Kurtis
I can’t believe you made this video I love these two movies sm
Kurtis: “Chipper… Wood Chipper” Me: “Chipper… 🥺 I hardly know her”
18:58 He did NOT!! 😆
HOLY SHIT HOW DID I EVEN WATCH THESE MOVIES AS A KID?! THESE ARE GIVING ME NIGHTMARES
Both of the movie's animation is giving me Goat Story vibes 🤣
Being born in 03’ I was naturally a bratz fan, they were huge at the time so growing up I always had them. But I was also a huge barbie fan and loved the movies! The bratz movies I remember borrowing from the dvd rent shop (when those existed) and I never liked them as much as barbie. But bratz were ‘cool’ and so if I played with my older cousin I would bust out the bratz to show I wasn’t a baby. But we would also play with barbies because there was literally only a year between us. Basically what I’m getting at is - I’m pretty sure most girls at the time just liked both? Bratz had better fashion sure. And better books if you were a nerd like me. But barbie had a huge house. And barbie movies were iconic with dvd video games attached. So cool. They all lived in harmony.
Kelly makes me want to swallow 87 nails and 7 push pins.
Would pay big money to watch Kurtis’ commentary on all barbie movies ever
Obviously if you compare anything to the Bratz fashion pixies film it will be better, just like if you tried comparing any other Bratz film to Barbie and the Nutcracker. This was honestly just a really good pick of a Bratz film and a bad pick of a Barbie film, which is why I want Kurtis to make a series of this :D
Kurtis: I'm not a Virgin  Source: trust me bro
dylan should be the main character of the movie
Angrily twerking is just what I do when I listen to grunge music
Hey Yo Kurtis since you're making a bit of money on the YouTube you should purchase a stretch Armstrong
the matrix chase scene without the music has not right to be this funny
NOT ONLY DOES HE HAVE THIS NASTY MUSTACHE BUT HE ALSO DIDNT GIVE US AN EXTRA GREETING… the audacity… idk you anymore …
the forehead hate 🥲
I haven’t received my extra greeting and I feel like I don’t wanna keep living anymore, how could you do this to me, Kurtis
Hedwig is female 🥲
18:58 kurtis you haven't watched Drew's video and that's a crime.
now u gotta watch the bratz super babyz its a nightmare that me and my little sister absolutely love ....... actually just watch all the movies thatd be fun hjkshjkhfds
Kurtis is near the completion of his 80's American Dad transformation
That ach at 7:46? Yeah I got that one too
I’m not ashamed to admit that Barbie was basically my entire childhood and I still watch the movies sometimes to this day
"WTF Rapunzel?!" 😂😂🤣
the music from the bratz movies SLAPPED
i cant believe you did a video on barbie and didnt pick princess and the pauper
I think kurtis videos are what I look forward to all week :') laughing my ass off as always
I can't believe you chose Barbie as Rapunzel because that is the only Barbie movie I've seen and I had it on DVD as a kid. For the longest time I thought it was a fever dream I had. It's real.
THIS VIDEO IS LITERALLY MY FUCKING CHILDHOOD I LOVEEEEE
the barbie movies kinda slap though ngl. also the recent barbies have been really inclusive and cool (I know its applauding a company for the bare minimum but it makes me happy nonetheless)
kurtis i'll let you pass bc ur cool, that climbing hair scene was a dream so her hair wasn't rlly getting yeeted, and penelope is a bit scared of height and flying- ironic bc yes shes a dragon ,, but im so happy you watched barbie legit my childhood, you have to watch mermadia it SLAPS
Barbie in the Nutcracker was my CHILDHOOD I'm so sad you didn't watch that one
Bless you!
Ya hooo da ba yo
"Doth thou carpets match thy drapes? "🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😩
The FBI watching Kurtis's search history: 🤨
Brianna is kind of a baddie
its strange to think that Wendie Malick the voice-actress of the twin's boss in the Bratz TV series also played Fraiser Cranes stepmother in the last season of Fraiser
Kurtis... I signed up for 2 GREETINGS. WHERE IS IT
You had baldpunzel right there
The second he said "climax" I thought of the weasel 13:30
This movie just. Reminds me of that barbie movie Princess and the Pauper. I wish kurtis reviewed that one because it truly is a trainwreck of a masterpiece
Can someone just tell me where I can watch Barbie as Rapunzel because I keep seeing it everywhere but have no idea where to actually watch the whole thing.
PLEASE make this a series I haven't laughed this hard in weeks
my mum used to have a Cindy doll which was Barbies original rival
Hilarious video. Really enjoy your content and humor. Keep it up. <3 Would like to see more of this kind of commentary. Bad movies are good to cheer oneself up. :D
LOL Kelly looks like what it feels like when you stub your toe hahaha Love it.
ya hooo da ba yo
We need to appreciate 10:06 more
A flying unicron is called a pegasus Kurtis and you should know this by now🙄
ok i really like kurtis but this video wasn't it, could've been much better
kurtis this video is so funny. why are you so funny in this video.
Oh my gosh that weasel always made me uncomfortable when I was little and now I know why!
I can’t believe this virgin didn’t give us an extra greeting.
kurtistown more like kurtistown
i'm sorry, yo... that angry twerking had me rollin..
Seeing this reminded me about other similar toys: the My Scene  dolls and Monster High dolls.
I died at "do i wanna gnome?"😭😭😭 So far this is my most favorite upload of Kurtis since the Christian Gamer one🏃🏻‍♀️ LOVE YOU KURTISSSS YOU'RE MY HAPPINESS 😭💚
DO EVER AFTER HIGH AND MONSTER HIGH NEXT
kurtis is the revoked extra greeting punishment for being called a virgin 😿
Unsubscribed. I feel unwelcome without the greeting
barbielat
I haven't started the video yet but TEAM BARBIE (movies) all the way.
The first 50 seconds are just Kurtis trying to convince us all he's not a virgin-
IM LOSING MY MINF UR SO FUNNY
im sad about the lack of extra greeting but im happy for you kurtis
"Dylan walked so eboys could run their fingers through their hair" SMART. GENIUS, EVEN!
not to be that person but kurtis you didn't even choose the best movie from each franchise 🧍
The only representation I had in Barbie was Kelly's forehead size
Uhhhh.... Ya hooo da ba yo?
Barbie burts bees
just me that thought the pixi king looked like Heman?
The Bratz movie is amazing but is also kind of a "raving is bad" PSA to kids
Ещё ещё ещё ещё ещё!!!! Можно ещё  Please more hochy eshe please
How u gonna call this man a virgin with that sick womb broom on his lip
My boyfriend and I noticed Kurtis always makes fart jokes and we love it
The editing in this video is top tier
The amount of dad jokes dropped, tells me Kurt's will be an amazing father one day👨 🤭 But a virgin can't have kids.
funny how the ad for this video is about shopkins lol
Umm flying unicorn are Pegasi KURTIS
i love that barbie AND bratz are for the gays
no extra greeting = dislike
"Do I wanna gno-" (mmm sound from ferret)
Only a virgin would get mad at being called a virgin.... VIRGIN!
Bratz never missed on the soundtrack
KURTIS YOUR EXTRA GREETINGS GIVE ME LUFE AND NOW YOU RUINED IT YOU SCAM ARTIST
ya hoo da ba yo
kurtis i am unsubscribing. i want my extra greeting at the beginning of my kurtis connor video. i could just watch danny gonzales if i won't get it!! /hj
bratz is superior im glad you agree
Finally! All of my favourite content creators going over the Barbie movies! (and bratz in this case but I never saw those as a child lol) This vid has to hold me over while I wait for Jenny Nicholson's full autopsy of all the Barbie movies. lol.
Wait..where's my extra greeting?! :(
We need Monster High, Ever after High and Rainbow High review. Very necessary.
Princess and the popper was the best Barbie film of all time 💯
where’s kurtis at i just watched a video Jared Leto made
kurtis is staring to look like somebody dad
YA HOO DA BA YO (＾3＾♪
You’re wrong. Barbie movies>Bratz movies but Bratz dolls > Barbie dolls
Unsubbed. Only subbed because I always got an extra greeting and now I didn’t even get 1. UNSUBBED
“I’m not a virgin” immediately followed by “I have a podcast” lol okay
My biggest issue with the outrage over how Bratz looked too unrealistic is that,, well yeah? Isn't that better? No one would expect to grow up to look like a Bratz doll.
Okay, but no joke, I had a doll growing up you could feed and it would poop. Like, it wasn't a Barbie, but the my point is the technology exists. Give Barbie an ass hole already.  (I had to Google it. It was called Baby Born, I guess. It's freakier than I remember.... Who thought this was a great idea?)
I got an ad for Extra Barbies when I clicked on this video-
I always much preferred Bratz to Barbie... maybe that's what I'm such a "slut" today
ive been watching u without subscribing bcs i want to feel superior when you said "so subscribe if you want extra greeting" but i still got to hear the extra greeting even when im not subscribing but u decided to stop doing it this is not fair i have to file a lawsuit
The gnome thing reminded me of the reoccuring dreams I had of an invisible gnome chasing me and trying to tickle me to death. I had those dreams as a child but god they still terrify me
For me the superior doll brand was Monster High
“The fits go hard” - *grown man with a mustache and a mullet*
21:27 im losing my mind
Hobi the Jungkook  sorry :p
16:23 don't blame me, I voted for Tarantino
We need Monster High representaion
Please review more Brats vs Barbies, this is gold man.
fashion pixies is the foundation of everything i am
ok but can we talk about how the overly loud footsteps in barbie are giving old school minecraft 💀
the video I didn’t know I needed
hi kurtis
I agree old school bar I’ve movies were noT it BUT THE NEW ONES THE NEW ONES KURTIS, Princess charm school was godtier
I dont know what im subscribed for if i dont get an extra greeting. Im heartbroken
this is a fever a dream
12:40 That looked actually pretty good, too.
I haven't laughed this much in a long time 42/10
If my boy Preminger doesn't get at least a shout out I'm suing
Finally talking about the real issues in life
give him to me auhhh 😩
The "I'm desperate" comment was underrated
Small soldiers HORRIFIED me, ya’ll too op
18:18 nosy cailínís lmaooo he actually sounds proper Irish, you can tell it's not just someone putting on an accent
no bratz movie will ever beat barbie's princess and the pauper
I’m sad I didn’t get the extra greeting T^T
Rapunzel is bald now needs to be a song 😭
I REMEMBER CHALK ZONE
Kurtis. If you think Kelly is scary, you need to see the kids in barbie swan lake. They are terrifying
(reads title)  _peace was never an option_
Bratz fashion pixiez was my childhood ✋🏼😀
there’s so many barbie movies let’s just review all of them, free content for the rest of the month lmao
Best barbie movie: Barbie: in princess charm school Best Bratz movie: Bratz: sleepover adventure I said what I said
Glad to see an unproblematic youtuber join the doll fandom
THAT IS WEASLE CU.M
its 3am and I have a migraine and yet im CACKLING
For real though I’ve had a Barbie as rapunzel blanket for like 18 years and it’s the best thing I own
sobbing and shaking. begging you to release the entire unedited b-roll of you imitating bratz dances.
I wasn’t allowed to have bratz dolls as a kid and I just realized that’s lowkey anti feminist of my mom
if we’re being honest monster high had the best movies, dolls and online games
Still a virgin.
kurtis if ur gonna twerk at least throw it back
bless you
no extra greeting? im unsubscribing
kurtis singing arctic monkeys is something i didnt know i needed
Okay virgin
men shouldn't get involved in women's things. it's barbie in the 12 dancing princesses and bratz rock angels or nothing
HEY! i didn't subscribe to NOT get an extra greeting >.>
Omg I remember watching that barbie movie
can we talk about how "tangled" totally ripped off barbie as rapunzel? mother gothel, same fukken name (unless that is a name she goes by in any of the oldest versions of the tale, but I've only ever heard it in these two movies) both rapunzels have a passion for painting
KURTIS WHERE THE FUCK IS THE EXTRA GREETING.
I just understood why trixie mattel is called trixie mattel
I’m not even kidding that Bratz movie was on REPEAT my entire childhood.
I'm leaving kurtistown if I dont get an extra greeting. I'm no longer a valued citizen, just a regular citizen, and I can be that anywhere
"current is the future..." Sounds a lot like the present to me
This is the funniest video! I'm weezing when I replay the part when you copy the Bratz dance! I'm so ded. Thank you for both ruining my childhood movies and making me laugh so hard! Love your content!
Bratz does rapunzel
i wheezed too hard at 18:44 and now my lungs hurt
I love so much that you did this video and I just talk to my boyfriend about it for like a whole hour
My favourite Barbie movie was Barbie Island Princess bcs the elephant was scared of the world just like I am.
Don't apologize for "Do I wanna gnome?", I laughed way too hard at that
I honestly thought the "VRG" stood for the Verge
Into The Woods is the most realistic when it comes to the pain Rapunzel feels when people climb her hair.
Kurtis Conner and ModernGurlz collab when?
If you ever revisit this topic, let me suggest Barbie swan lake or mariposa VS brats rock angels
If I remember my Barbie lore correctly wasn't the reason Rapunzel didn't leave on Penelope before that there was a very very high magic barrier around the tower and house and Penelope is/was afraid of heights? Only her father was able to fly above the barrier
dont be a coward.. watch EVERY barbie and bratz movie INCLUDING the bratz liveaction
No extra greeting :(
WHERES MY EXTRA GREETING 😭😭😭😩😩
It pains me that Kurtis didn’t watch Bratz Rock Angelz. I wanted to see his reaction the Tweevils 😂
"Dylan walked so Eboys could run their fingers through their hair" 😂😂😂 BEST joke here hands down
should have watched the 12 dancing princesses 😔
So mad that he didnt watch Princess and the Pauper. Best Barbie movie, hands down
Trixie Mattel is coming. And you should probably be scared
you really pitted the best bratz movie against a mid tier barbie movie it was never gonna be fair. should've watched mermadia or princess and the pauper. thats the good shit.
Wait aren’t Rapunzel and Stefan siblings?
Heh Kurtis is a vrg what a nerd
no extra greeting? unsub
man kurtis' videos are so entertaining yet relaxing at the same time i love it
the amount of memories this unlocked
unsubscribing because i didn’t get an extra greeting.
BARBIE RAPUNZEL WAS MY SHIT
I only subbed for the extra greeting smh my head
Best video of the year kurtis
“Not a Virgin”? Hmmm... sounds like something a virgin would say my dude 🤨
When kurtis started talking about the rave it got a little to real 😭😭😭😭 my jaw started.to hurt and I wanted to buy a Baha blanket
I needed that extra greeting this morning 😭
I'm real I have a big forehead 😄
Rapunzel is my favourite Barbie movie and Otto  is so weird but I love him. ‘I forgot that that little juicy detail’ or whatever playing through your head whenever a sentence anywhere close to it is said. Every time. It lives in my head rent free.
I needed the laughs omg, thank you.
dear mayor, you have done the peaking. best wishes to fellow citizens, - former barbie consumer & bratz survivor
Bald kurtis is so cursed im sry-
Time to unsubscribe
i know you said one barbie vs one bratz movie was enough...but it would be iconic to make some sort of series out of this
i need more vids about bratz<3
Fun Fact: Hedwig is a She All this time I thought it was He lmao.
10:28 Kurtis Penelope's whole plot is that she CAN'T fly She only learns it towards the end of the movie
I kinda want a part 2
The horniest weasel award should've gone to Harvey Weinstein tho
I’m sorry Kurtis you have peaked this is the funniest video you have ever made…
As a kid I grew up in the midst of this battle. It was Bratz for me without a doubt, though I enjoyed Barbie and MyScene movies just as much.
WAIT NO WHY DID I THINK THE DAD AS THE PIXIE KING WAS FUCKING PH1LZ4 I HATE IT HERE </3
You cannot compare these two things. They are both good
i watched the barbie movie as a kid. jesus christ
why did i think this thirty minute video was just going to be kurtis comparing the actual dolls themselves
I knew he would choose Bratz. As he should😌💅
I'm sightnly laughing so hard right now, trying not to wake my roommate, about the "balls" situation. 😂😂😂😂⚰️
Hey man, that mustache sucks!!
the arctic monkeys reference was the most out of nowhere, yet so goddamn welcome joke I've ever seen
I'm a 24 male laying in bed at 3am watching a video on dolls... life is great
Kurtis...🙄🤚🏻 Whats the Penelope slander about, its a whole plot point that she only learned to fly throughout the movie because she is scared of heights... also out of all the classic barbie movies... how do you pick rapunzel??
petition to make «rapunzel is bald now » a song.
I need " rapunzel is bald now" on a shirt Drop the merch kurtis 😩
Kurtiiissss, I need moooreeee
Gothel looks like Scary Godmother
NO we need round 2. do the 12 dancing princesses Vs the bratz one where they eliminate their modelling competition by forcing them to overdose and then driving them off cliffs and shit
I love ur moustache kurtis
“Achievement unlocked” made me laugh so hard I couldn’t breathe. *tips caps*
Didn’t think you’d make a video so political I don’t know how to feel about this..
Growing up in the early 2000s Bratz films and  games was most of my childhood. Rock Angelz was the main one I remember.
the comments here are top tier reading material. keep it up fellow kurtistown residents
My mom thought Bratz were slutty 😂😂😂 never got one
that was a big sneeze at the end, kurtis. bless u.
10:41 The chalk zone theme song will never leave my head and I'm very happy about it
Now were talking about the REAL topics
Full versión of Do I Wanna Gnome please and thank you
Quality content
It took everything in me not to dislike this just bc of the lack of extra greeting
excuse me barbie princess and the pauper is a masterpiece
You have to watch the children featured ones; bratz super babyz and swan lake easily the best ones
rapunzel's got the paint! the paint, the paint, paint brush!
Great work
I loved everything about this video. Please give us MOAR.
no extra greeting? unfollow
I always wondered what the letters meant, now I can finally sleep.
This was literally my favorite Barbie movie bruhhh. Other than Barbie and the diamond castle which is just about two cottage core lesbians where the whole plot of the movie was "they were roommates"
Barbie was lit but Bratz were way more cool. Always mildly jealous of those women who model their whole life on Barbie
The garden gnome was Irish
bro picked like the WORST barbie movie
oh god i remember watching that bratz movie in the early days of my youth and the voice of that god forsaken ghnome gave me whiplash all these years i thought he was a a fucking fever dream i had what the fuck
Kurt tring to use his mayoral power over the good citizens of kurtistown!!  We love it here and we will not stop till the regular intro is back!!!
Never eat or drink during a Kurtis Conner video.
*angry twerking*
now do monsterhigh
PUT THE WEASEL NOISE ON THE SOUND BOARD
monster high vs ever after high
The matrix sequence took me out
Bratz the brand frustrates me so much coz they could be doing more! How is barbie still mking movies and tv shows in 2021 but bratz is quiet? They're letting Barbie win and its upsetting me and my homegilrls
7:52 the fact that that Stephan guy could wrap his cartoon hands around Barbie's WHOLE waist lmao
I once had a fever dream and somehow you channeled it and made videos about it
a 30 year old man with a mustache and a mullet ranking barbie movies? seems ok to me
KURTIS you are not in charge!! Please give me my extra greeting 🥺🥺
15:53 Brutal
Does anyone else remember this one Bratz movie where models were being poisoned to make their bones old and the Bratz were spies and at the end they jumped out a falling car but they had rocket boots. Or was the some weird fever dream?
also, you missed the best part of that Bratz movie, when Lena says to Dylan "you like that😏" 😭
“This is not realistic” - kurtis at a movie about dolls magically becoming pixies who put people into a dance trance
Unsubbing for the missing greeting
the way I saw both of these as a kid😩✋
Barbie Rapunzel was always a fave back in the day… swan lake - or rather fairytopia would’ve been a better choice for the Barbie argument 💁🏻‍♀️  And for bratz, how DARE you not use bratz rock angels… smh kurtis I can’t believe you’ve done this 😭😭
omg reading your comments make me laugh  love your community
i laughed so much i almost peed myself. but im still mad about the no extra greeting
the fact that i watched this movie as a kid multiple times and thought "this makes perfect sense, i see nothing wrong here"
pleaseee play the Barbie horse game or the bratz the movie game for ur gaming channel my childhood self would die of happiness
That was the best dad sneeze ever
Why did he pick like one of the worst Barbie movies to review? Legend of the Pegasus slaps so hard
the barbie princess movies were superior aesthetically but the bratz movies were superior in dialogue
I AM NOW BOYCCOTING KurTiS Conner from now on
is it just me or does something seem really really different about kurtis in this video? like the editing and the energy is just shockingly different to me than normal
Okay but the Bratz faces always creeped me out
Kurtis holy fuck your videos lately have been absolutely hilariously good!
im only liking this video because of the bratz twerking and kurtis mimicking her 😏
when i was younger i really wanted bratz cause of the clothes and different coloured characters but my parents didn’t want me to play with them cause of “unfair beauty standards” >:/
My fave toy growing up was a mechanical Penelope Dragon that flapped its wings and said lines from the movie when you pressed her stomach. Hearing her voice again was such a nostalgia trip I think I'm actually 10 again now
Bratz is superior don’t fight me on this.
i read it as barbie vs barbz was like huh👁👄👁
The Barbie movie gives me big RuneScape vibes
I was not expecting a fucking Artic Monkeys pun in this video. Like out of all the things an "Irish-gnome inspired AM pun" has to be pretty unlikely for a video about girls' dolls films. Also...  "Baby we both gnome that the nights were mainly made for saying things (in an Irish accent) you can't say tomorrow day"
No extra greeting? I hope people unsubscribe. That would be hilarious. Then post a comment saying "See what happens when you don't give extra greetings? You lose subscribers."
Kurtis, kurtis kurtis kurtis. Kurtis. Dude. You need to review more Barbie/Bratz content, I'm begging
Monster high is the supreme
out of all the barbie movies to review...
Vrgn
y’all sleeping on Barbie in the Nutcracker
ya hooo da ba yo
your editing catches me off guard, couldn't stop laughing, loved the video
I'm team Barbie just because of swan lake and 12 dancing princesses, but Bratz are bad bleeps, I can't deny, I really wanted one as a kid
I didn’t know how much serotonin Kurtis singing “Do I Wanna Gnome” would give… Do I Wanna Know is one of my favorite songs and now i want a full cover by Kurtis lol
Princess & the pauper is top tier but Magic of the Pegasus is elite shit. That has to be hands down the funniest of the OG barbie movies
I THOUGHT THAT MEANT THAT HE WAS A VIRGO WHY DIDNT I THINK OF VIRGIN CVFNJVFNGOEFJWDBGJERFHNDJBFGHUKFE
Just wanted to let everyone know I can do amazing impression of Odile & yes I do use my powers for evil
My boyfriends name is Dylan and he kinda looks like him lol
I use to care about being a virgin. At some point between working 50 hours a week and obsessively building credit i seemed to forgot to actually live a little lol. Also autism. Fucking autism.
watching Kurtis experience post joke clarity is often funnier than the jokes. which are pretty funny.
Please shave your face is not a mustache face it makes me a tad uncomfortable
oh boy TWO of my childhood fave movies?! also how did he not address Dylan singing about a fox- ????
Bruh I’m rolling this commentary is something else ily kurtis best mayor ever
This is a rip off! I subscribed for an extra greeting at the beginning of every single one of your videos 😡👊💥 give me my extra greeting 😤😤😤
barbie as rapunzel was my childhood ngl
the mexicans knowing it says verga
Why the hell did I even subscribe if I can't get the second "hi there"? I. DESERVE. IT!!
Video good. I LOLed. I can't think of anything funny to say but I still wanna show my appreciation☄
Rapenuzel always wraps her hair around some shit her neck isn’t holding the weight 😂
Arthur?😂✨
How could he fucking not greet me a second time :(
You think Chelsea is creepy, wait till you see Bibble
Me with extra greeting :😲😁  Me with no extra greeting 😥😭😢
Ya hoo da ba yo!
i just wanted too mention that i was having a great week. kurtis released this video without an extra greeting. and an hour went by and i had a break down and slammed my door on my family. :)
my friend calls me a bratz cuz I got plumper lips and im just like 😃
The way he picked my fav barbie movie and fav bratz movie thank u for ur service
Jokes on you monster high is better than both
I can’t believe you compared one of the most average Barbie movies to the best Bratz movie
extra greeting has always kind of annoyed me.,,,,,, I am content
do not come for barbie as rapunzel that shits my childhood
That’s a good one, the rapunzel movie is an og fave. Kelly do be looking rough tho. Quality is def dog water  Also omg Penelope I love her so much
Kurtis you made so many mistakes at the barbie rapunzel movie part, please 😭😭😭
barbie steals from classic ballets
tripping balls to Barbie vs brats
that bratz movie just awaken memories i didn't know i have
the weasel 😀
idk bratz genie magic is superior
Monster hiiiiigh
U have to do monster high
thank u! jeez, the extra greeting was soo repetitive i would skip it. I think it's a good idea to not do it anymore.
As a brown girl, I never liked dolls remotely until I got Bratz then they were my life
18:07 I thought she said "she`s a pepsi"
kelly needs bangs
I didn't expect to see bald Kurtis today
¿
BARBIE'S WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE FIT BETWEEN THAT STEPHAN'S HANDS ??
please do all barbie movies. thanks.
I...i wanna gnome....
12:13 oml when I was a kid I never realized how awkward that was
Kurtis Conner canceled
"Teas that make them shit" how did he know i just drank slimtea
Forget about Barbie and Bratz, Myscene was the best ok 😂
Imagine Kurtis came out with a Barbie vs Brats series’s, I feel like that would be the highlight of 2021.
"When these big-eyed gals showed up" 😂😂 those were my faves
4:12 assing
"Do I wanna gnome?" was the best worst joke Ive ever heard. Paired with the defeated look of Kurtis realizing his brain is a curse. I couldnt stop laughing
i was most definitely a bratz child. THE BRATZ ROCK ANGELZ PLAYSTATION 2 VIDEO GAME <33 i never stopped playing it
barbie with functioning ashole is just baby alive
Quite literally pissed myself a little with the angry twerking section 😂
this rlly made me chuckle
RAPUNZEL IS BALD NOW IS THE BEST EXECUTED SKIT ON THIS CHANNEL NO I WILL NOT TAKE CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM
Can't believe you didn't watch the iconic Bratz: The Movie
I wish he watched rock angels
Say what you want about barbie, but bratz will never have *their* version of that thirsty weasel scene. 😂
18:59 this screenshot exposed that you watched 12 minutes of your own 36 minute video AND that you‘ve been listening to bo burnham  💔 are u doing ok
why the media keep pitting bad bitches against each other 😔😔 smh my head
Wait a sec why does barbie/rapunzel have a younger sister if she was stolen as a baby- did gothel go back to steal a SECOND baby?? Did rapunzel not notice???
Okey Bratz are the superior doll, but Bratz rock angelz movie and video game are SO GOOD
You should watch the wacky adventures of Ronald McDonald cartoons. May I recommend the classic, “scared silly?”
I love this. LOL that Bratz party did look lit
Kurtis be lookin like a true country snack
horny weasal's name IS OTTO AND HE dESERVES OUR RESPECT
This one is the funniest for awhile!))) Was laughing out loud the entire video)))  Thank you for this !)
My name is Kelly. Should I be offended?
Yes Kurtis. *Arby's* is in trouble
Correct me if I’m wrong but Penelope was afraid of heights?
its funny because i saw this movie like 100 times when I was little because I had the CD
Mattel tried to sue me for my product, Bar Bees -- they're bees, but they go in your bar. Call me, business owners.
Barbie actually had more diversity though. Barbie was blond, Theresa was Brunette (could be played as Latina or white brunette), Midge was a red-head, Christie was black, and Kira was Asian. Then there was Steve (black male) and Ken (Blond male). I don't think Bratz ever had that much at any one time. Also, Barbie had a diverse range of interests and jobs. Bratz rarely went beyond just fashion.
theres no music in that chase scene bc those step sounds are ✨ELITE ✨😫
Barbie: in the Nutcracker used to absolutely terrify me…creepy mouse people..
She looks like “what stubbing your toe feels like” was a perfect description. I understood that deep in my soul
7:31 IM FUCKING DYING
kurtis im sorry but why did you choose literally THE WORST barbie movie to watch. the only one that would've been worse is like,, nutcracker
"Briannas friends get kidnapped by the pixies and Dylan twerks about it which is honestly a power move." Why did I picture Dylan. You know who I mean yall 👁
12:22 14:32
I swear these animations looked better when I was a child
Kurtis this video was 11/10. So funny LMAOO
i feel… empty without the extra greeting 😪😪💔💔
Bratz fashion is literally the blueprint to the style trends we're seeing today
dude in norway there is a brand of pizza called Big one
as an irish person, that gnome was actually irish sounding, not like the fake "ohh begone and begorrah nora my potatoes shall not see the morn" but like saying "ha" between every sentence and "what would your ma think" are actual like irish things
Bless you
Why should I be subscribed if I don't get a special greeting 😠
21:27 👌🏻
Kurtis im BEGGING you to watch barbie life in the dream house
This is my childhood
This is your funniest video yet lmao
Kurtis misgendered Hedwig. You know what that means. #kurtisisoverparty
ya hooo da ba yo
I have hemorrhoids and it hurts when I laugh. Damn you Curtis. Damn you to HELL. grr
Ya think you've reviewed every Doll Company? Hah...*Ahems in Monster High* MONSTER HIGH MY GUY!!!!!
KURTIS I AM EATING I DONT NEED BARBIE FART NOISES
I'm proud of our mayor for doing what he likes #kurtisisfree
Lisa Fevral just did a cute video styling the BRATZ dolls 👁
Oki got my snacks for the second half
brats angelz yo...barbie nutcracker movie was the best movie tho....
Ooooh i always thought that was for VIRGO
The fact that you didnt review princess and the pauper is a literal, federal crime. But thats fine because rapunzel is a classic also i guess.
the angry twerking has no business being that funny
Barbie and the 12 dancing princesses is the best Barbie movie, change my mind
It’s nearly 1 am and I’m trying to not laugh lol
Doth thy carpet match thy drapes
Watch barbie fairy secret and barbie fashion fairytale  please
i will forever support the Rock Angels 🥲
Lmao my sister had one of those pixie glasses, she was a big fan of BRATZ
3:04 ... do you not get the irony in your joke 😬 because that's exactly what happened to society, bestie ... uhhh 😬
the commentary on the barbie movie took me out it used to be my favorite movie and never realized how much it didnt make sense
i feel like this should be the gateway that leads to kurtis playing the bratz rock angelz game
finally some talking about important things
Please put Barbie saying “balls” on your soundboard
Bratz wins for me just because of that angrily twerking scene
Barbie 12 dancing princessess is better plus they fixed kelly/chelsea’s balding problem
In a story me and my gf are doing there is a women who is a stripper and she is a weasel
24:05  I thought it was lord farquad with ginger hair for a second
I remember having Barbie as Rapunzel at my grandma's house and me and my sis would watch it all the time and it SLAPPED
Kurtis you have to bring back the intro it’s the reason I subscribed
2:57 looking at IG models i think maybe they did 0_0
This was a good video, I laughed a lot
*I'M GONNA PISS ON YOUWW*
wow im unsubbing, i didnt even get my extra greeting, ;(
I'm super stressed about school right now and kurtis is the only person that can make me laugh this much and relax a little so thanks kurtis
Bye I thought it meant Virgo
This is quite a controversial video
Ok but you should tOTALLY make a whole video on the live action Bratz movie
i don't think kurtis knows what vrg stands for in spanish...
Kurtis you're canceled
Some of the barbie movies are so good tho tbh
Stefan's hands fit all the way around Barbie's waist. Where are her organs?!
Kurtis I am so upset, I subscribed for that extra greeting and now I'm getting ripped off what is this
"so no hedwig?" ISTG HOW DO YOU COME UP WITH THESE 😭
okay but why do i actually wanna dress like these bratz dolls-
Bratz supremacy fellas I only aspired be cool like them ‘cause they don’t even look human enough for little me to think I could look like them (this needs more nuance but lol) unlike uhh yknow b*rbie
I used to love the bratz movies as a kid tbh
" bratz dolls are sluts in every barbie dream house" the fact that an adult wrote that i-
rematch with barbie princess and the pauper and bratz rock angels, coward
I had bratz and I remember one year for Christmas I got a bratz car that had a functional radio and I had them jamming out to the HOTTEST HITS OF 2006😭 damn im getting old so fucking fast wth happened....
2:50 YOU STRAIGHT UO USED THE GREENDALE FLAG LOGO PLS
it felt weird without the extra greeting but the FOLKS 👏is the most important part and that was untouched so ill allow it
feeling blessed that this video was released on my birthday
can you pls get rid of the pube stache
Why is no one talking abt that do i wanna gnome joke😭😭😭😭
I like it better with out the extra greeting
You look like meatcanyon
Never watched either movie. The Barbie one looked fine (except Kelly & the goblin brigade) but the Bratz movie was like ocular assault
I’m high, and this content is EXACTLY what I need
rapunzel is bald now~~~~~~~~~~
Okay but Barbie Princess Charm School is the best 🤷🏼‍♀️
This was an S tier video Kurtis.
The word Monday first was institute in nordic winking time, and it means moon day, and was picked up by the English people since then wikings liked to attack them, and they had a lot of influence on the English people. All days are actually named after a nordic God or something they were known for  Just thought it was fun to know
watching bratz movies were the highlight of my whole childhood so this video made my day 🤩
Can’t believe you didn’t watch bratz rock angels
"You can't just sue someone you don't like." Me as an Australian looking at the political landscape in my country: I wish that were true.
My mom didn’t let me and my sister play with Bratz as children😭
My childhood! 😭 Love that, thanks Kurtis
Haven’t watched the whole video but yes, I did throw my fist in the air with success as Kurtis said “Barbie Rapunzel”    And yes, I had Barbie horses or whatever the fuck in PS2 (I’m wine drunk sorry for my aggressiveness)   And YES, I had Bratz dolls and still have my Bratz camera…I believe it’s Sasha but it was like a birthday Bratz??? Someone validate me on this
"I'm not a virgin" - A virgin
when is the kelli diss track dropping kurtis 😈😈
Climbing up Rapunzel's hair doesn't have to hurt her head if she ties a decent knot around the balustrade or whatever so that takes the tension instead of her head. You guys need to hand in your scout badges this lack of rope-based knowhow  is disgraceful
why are we pitting them against one another…they’re all girlfriends
Those knomb dudes are from that one brats fairytale movie with snow white
love the new video kurt! been watching it over and over
Not the “dos thou carpet match the drapes” bit🤣🤣🤣
will never stop thinking abt the bratz doll angrily twerking face directly in the shot
The chames jarles reference really caught me off guard.
I had a Bratz game for my leapfrog 😎
That pixies movie haunts my memories
In terms of memeability, I’d choose Bratz. While Barbie does have that funny scene with the weasel, the Bratz series has many more ooc moments. For example, the following is real dialogue from the series:  “CARBS!”  “What’re you trying to do, kill me? Make me fat?”  “I ONLY EAT FREENS!”  And this was because another character bought her one burger, she even fires her and any future descendants on the spot as well as blacklisting her from the industry.
Not doing an extra greeting is the kind of thing a virgin would do 🤔
This made me laugh sm...
sorry kurtis ily but i don't want any barbie movie video that does not include bibble
I am happy you are cutting the ropes of the extra greeting!  (if thats what you want, then im happpy for you!) Sooo long ago you mentioned how you 'had' to keep doing it, but nooooo, we as subscribers have had enough extra greetings! It's okay if it's over/soon to be over!
Nah barbie and a mermaids tale was THE MOVIE, thats what u shouldve revewied lmao. it goes so hardddd and defined half my childhood
Kurtis, you fool, you absolute disgrace to the human race. How could you ever think about putting Rapunzel up against Bratz Fashion Pixies? It's not a fair fight. Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper would have been a better choice. You could have at least chosen 12 dancing princesses.
Bald Kurtis looks like Kevin from shameless
Barbie is the queen because you can’t spell Barbie without bi
I love the variety in content that Kurtis posts
BRATZ SUPREMACY ‼️‼️
DYLAN TWERKING TO MEGAN SENT ME (19:38)
23:35 i'm just gonna leave this personal timestamp
YES U CHOSE THE PIXI MOVUE OTS MY FAVE SKSKSJSJNSS
Listen kurtis, you made a big mistake. Because you chose the bratz fashion pixies movie, you should have chosen the barbie equivalent of it- barbie a fashion fairytale movie. Disappointed in you.
Kurtis dance moves have me rolling on the floor xD that angry twerking? Omg, I had to pause the video and pick myself up first
I do remember chalk zone and I appreciated you saying it a second time with bonus cutaways.
Bratz was made by a Mattel worker
legitimately upset about the extra greeting
so no barbie as princess and the pauper??????!!!
disliked bc no extra greeting
21:41 this is the funniest thing ive ever seen
I love this vid Kurtis, great one
I'm sorry Kurtis but I'm gonna need you to watch Bratz Kidz Fairy Tales because that movie is ridiculous and the dwarves form a boyband
The Barbie Story movie and the barbie fashion show game were my childhood
Wow no extra greeting, I'm devastated.
I support Kurtis not doing the extra greeting. He seems like the joy of it has left and honestly as long as I get my "folks!" I'm happy
there is no sound because it's "ASMR"
ppl who have been here for YEARS DESERVE THE EXTRA GREEEETINGNFGSJWLAKXEJ
Ok, now you have to react to the Bratz series!! It is actually hilarious!!!
MY CHILDHOOD
*weasel moan*   Please just give me the $500 I am a music major I am fiscally the horniest weasel
kurtis watches bo burnhams special ONE time and thinks he can stop the extra greeting
These movies are my literal childhood I’m so glad you made this video
"so no hedwig?" SENT ME LMAOOO
BRATZ GANG 4 life😜
C'mon people let Drew live. So what if he doesn't give the extra greeting? He isn't a Netflix subscription for y'all to cancel him
Never use the echo effect on the word “BALLS”  again it’s still echoing in my head
Was unable to watch past 38sec due to the tears in my eyes after not receiving the extra greeting.
Uh Barbie was "inclusive" of many ethnicities long before Bratz existed. To be fair Bratz doesn't even look like our *species* so it's hard to call them inclusive.
OMGG the barbie movie unclocked memoriessssssssss
he ran away...was that a jojo reference?
Well... Exuly Mattel sued mga (the company that made bratz) because the creator of the bratz line worked in Mattel and thought the idea of bratz while he was working in Mattel. I think that he even drew some of he's ideas and stuff. When he stopped working for mattel and made bratz with mga that was technically illegal because when you work for a company like Mattel all of your ideas and stuff are owned by Mattel and I believe that you sign a contract about that. Clawdeena9 has made a good video about that
I want you to review more barbie and Bratz movies so badddddddd
Me named Kelli: :'(
I just woke up and watching this video feels as if I'm still dreaming. I'm gonna go insane
Sorry but the reverb on “balls” is killing me 💀
please react to the Bratz Super Babyz movie !! it has haunted me since seeing it as a child
This is the funniest kurtis video I’ve seen in a while and that’s saying a lot 10/10 would recommend
I can’t be the only one that has no recollection of the dragon ever being in that Barbie movie...
when i saw the title i thot this was gonna be about nicki minaj fans
You’re not in control, we are. We demand an extra greeting. Spread the word, Kurtistownians. #kurtistownmayorisoverparty
Kurtis saying Bratz movies are superior like a true king
I'm sobbing uncontrollably because you deprived us of our extra greeting. It's our birth right as citizens of kurtis town, a reward for pledging our allegiance to you. Unsubcribes!
for a more fair comparison, you should have watched barbie rapunzel and the bratz retelling of cinderella
Scroll scrotums more like “scrolltums” am I right fellas?
Kurtis are you ok?
bratz fashion pixies is the best bratz movies, but one of the more outlandish ones i think because the bratz aren't the main main characters so i am unsure if it's TRUE to the SERIES ya know
I just got very distracted at the end there by Kurtis' Twitter banner. Because. Like. It's really nice that he did something like that for pride, but now I'm wondering... Is there any particular reason that the enby and ace flags are given so much prominence? Because just... I could actually pretty easily see Kurtis being nonbinary and asexual. I could vibe with it. But my other guess is those reflect the identities of the artist. Either way it's a bit unexpected but very neat!
Unsubscribing virgin
Another long video, thank you for the food ⁽⁽ଘ( ˊᵕˋ )ଓ⁾⁾
Good video
hey kurtis, i love u and if ur sick of doing the extra greeting every single video, i dont blame u!! u should stop doin it if ur starting to hate it cuz i get the feeling that thats whats happening :-) good video bestie keep it up !!!!
I watched bratz go to paris and it was so scary i am still scarred, i couldnt sleep for a week
So when are you gonna release the full ~Do I Wanna Gnome?~ track?
6:55 scroll-tums
how could you not watch barbie the princess and the pauper????? that movie slaps
bro he literally watched my favorite Bratz movie and i couldn't be happier
thanks kurtis u've messed up my yt ads forever
do i wanna gnooome
i literally got so excited when he said he was doing the pixie movie for the bratz side. That was one of my all time favorites as a kid and i never heard anyone talk about it. It’s low key a little shitty watching it now but still holds a special place in my heart.
As a barbie fan im angrily liking this video
Bratz forever
Next up: Polly pockets vs Groovy girls
You should have reviewed barbie princess and the pauper it's supposed to be the best one
Dance more
my mom wouldn't let me get BRATZ because she thought they would make me wanna be a brat smh
Bratz animation reminds me of Jimmy Neutron
Kelly dream club was the SHIT tho
its 3am and kurtis dancing like that one bratz guy at the end has me in TEARS I CANT BREATHE
10:06 https://youtu.be/2uSG8BrvKt0
IM REVOKING MY KURTISTOWN CITIZENSHIP. It’s MY extra Greeting and I WANT IT NOW
Period Kurtis Bratz are superior !
i am a little disappointed it wasn't bratz rock angelz
a quick realization of how old kurtis is so wild to think abt 😭
Main question is, what was liking scene from the Bratz movie scene ? since we didn’t get that last part for your video Kurtis
haha virgin
Where my Barbs at 🙄✋
Bratz hands down, the better doll. But some of my fave kids movies were Barbie movies so 💁 but I felt Bratz resembled me more. And it's funny you should mention that people thought Bratz dolls were sl*tty, that's literally what my mom used to talk about with my sister 😂😂😂
please i need more kelly hate content
THIS IS UR BEST VIDEO YET KURTIS
Worstie i was looking forward to that extra greeting all week 😔😔😔
I was just thinking about that gnome the other day :D
WHERE IS MY EXTRA GREATING THIS IS PERFECTLY OKAY BUT IM KIND OF UPSET OKAY BUT THANK YOU FOR POSTING ILY
kurtis,,, I don't think you realize how much this Bratz movie means to me. also referring to Yasmin, Chloe, Jade, and Sasha just as the "friends" in the movie ,,, very disrespectful
That Bratz movie was my fav when I was younger and honestly that whole movie feels like a fever dream
Honestly, I fully support Kurtis's decision to not do the extra greeting. He is our mayor and Kurtistown is free to evolve and grow however he'd like it to.
did anyone else have the rapunzel barbie with the string in the back and when u pulled the string it would change the length of her hair … or was that just me
I laughed so freaking much
I freaking LOVED Bratz fashion pixies as a kid 😂😂😂
7:34 that description is so fucking accurate 💀
The fact that he picked my two favorites from my childhood has me ascended
“dylan walked so eboys could run… their fingers through their hair”
so basically the bratz pixie girls are ronstadt when they put on the glasses
PLSSSSS IMAGINING THE MMMMMING COMJNG FROM KURTIS HAS ME ROLLING
this is one of my favorite kurt videos in a minute
I love the mustache😎
Ya hoooo da ba yo
I never watched bratz as a kid, damn I was missing out  I didn't really watch Barbie either, I just played with the about 50 dolls I had  More of a Tinkerbell gal myself
Bratz are those girls periodttt😌😌
I was definitely a Bratz kid (movies,dolls, and PC games), but I also loved Barbie (dolls and movies). Some honorable mentions that made my childhood are My Scene, Diva Starz, and Polly pocket.
i think you are officially my first webcrush :,) srly   !!! ever EVER pandemics standarts
ya hooo da ba yo
"DOETH THOU CARPETS MATCH THY DRAPES" I have to use this lmfaooo
has kurtis seen bibble from fairytopia
Bratz movies are darker while barbie movies have that "ill cry when I re-watch this when I'm older" vibe.
ok now that we have this we need a review of "MyScene: Goes to Hollywood" (dare I say a great feature film)
I SIGNED UP FOR AN EXTRA GREETING WTF IS THIS. TO NEW SUBSCIRBERS:THIS IS A SCAM AND HE WILL NOT PROVIDE AN EXTRA GREETING EVERY TIME. IM VERY UPSET.
ddddddddd
26:32 my sense of humor is broken
upset that kurtis didn’t watch the barbie and the three musketeers
can tell this is gonna be a banger already , you virgin
I CABTDO THIS TBIS VIDEO WAS SO GOOD UELPW S
Ya hoo ya ba doo
This is easily the funniest video on YouTube right now. I died laughing the entire time. Lol more of these please. 😂
11:43 yes Gothel! ADHD represent 😍
I was only subscribed for the extra greeting. Guess it’s been real kurtis
The do I wanna gnome joke was the best joke I’ve ever fucking heard on this channel hands down
More watch more bratz vs barbie it’s hilarious
I never had Barbies or bratz, I had sylvanians lol
*SO NO HEDWIG*
kurtis! <3
I want to know where's Kelly and why is there some Chelsea kid as replacement ?
But.. i didn't wanna gnome
U look like the dude from stranger things
i fckin lost it at "that thou carpet match thy drapes"
hey if you reacted to twilight i would literally do nothing, so please do it because i think it has some of the worst scripts and acting of any movie ever
NO extra greeting?? what the hell Kurtis. i am so upset and disappointed
are we gonna ignore the fact that Kurtis called Hedwig "he" when she was actually a girl...
Kelly was always stirring shit up. Me and my homies hate Kelly. 🤜👧🏼
HOW have I not seen any comments about the fucking "Do I wanna gnome?" joke, followed by the silent regret and self reflection omg
barbie as rapunzel was my fav movie when i was little LOL
I swear Kurtis better review barbie life in the dream house. It is the FUNNIEST thing ever and Raquel is probably the most relatable character. And as a comparison the Bratz tv show is also really good but not as relatable.
18:44 kurtissss 😭
Every time he inserted the “balls” clip from the Barbie movie… I let out a nice chuckle 💀
kurtis you should watch the bratz kids sleepover movie. you'd be having night terrors for the rest of your life
This Barbie movie was my favorite, another one that’s good is the nutcracker lol!
I'll never forgive kurtis for not choosing Princess Charm School for the barbie movie
The fashion has made a comeback so it makes complete sense bratz are returning too, otherwise it’s a missed opportunity
Your mustache looks like two capybaras kissing
Watch the Barbie and the 12 Dancing Princesses or Princess and the Pauper and then come talk to me.
18:45 Arctic Monkeys Good
I request a revisit to this topic with the best movies: watch barbie princess and the pauper, and bratz rock angelz
I would die to see you watch princess and the pauper
okay but i wont accept this until you watch princess and the pauper and fairy secret
no extra greeting im going to bazooka myself
im in love with you kurtis
It’s okay ur done with the slogan I was always wait for the FOLKS anyway ps, folks was on if my favourite high school teachers slogans
Dad: *transforms into Pixie King* Me- without a second thought: DILF
You missed out on Byron Powell
No extra greeting? Unsubbed. Simple as that.
'cymballine's friends' u mean chloe and yasmin??? the DISRESPECT
i haven't watched the video yet but kurtis better be watching princess & the pauper edit: he didn't. see you in a duel in the dennys parking lot kurtis.
I feel like the Barbie movies are making a cultural comeback and I’m so here for it
I used to love Barbie as Rupunzle when i was young :p But now I have replaced it by Tangled lol
9:30 that's why she wrapped it around that pillar
IM SO GLAD YOU CHOSE THAT SPECIFIC BRATZ MOVIE ITS THE BEST ONE
Bratz is my childhood I watched EVERY MOVIE i found
21:58 is the reason I decided to move to Kurtistown.
lowkey wished kurtis reviewed bratz rock angelz or passion 4 fashion
Princess. And. The. Pauper. I’m fine with giving up my extra greeting but we deserve this Mr. Mayor
A flying unicorn is called a pegasus
I'm sad I didn't get an extra greeting. :/
I watched Barbie in Rapunzel obsessively as a kid, haven't seen a clip of it in over 20 years. It is not how I remember it.
i’m honestly so proud of u for not doing an extra greeting. i know you’ve been not wanting to do it for awhile and i’m so glad that you finally worked through your fears and stood up for what you want 😎💕✨👍🏻💜
how did he notice all this stuff I've been watching the bratz pixies movie for literally years and didn't notice any of this
The amount of reverb he put on “balls” is beautiful
I grew up on barbie only because my parents were poor and so they could get me a barbie for like 5-10 dollars. I only ever had 1-2 bratz in my life
here at 69k likes
you look like a 70s country dad
no please why
oh god this brought me right back to losing my Barbie as Rapunzel: Penelope the Dragon toy in a Nordstrom fitting room as a child and it was the worst day of my life up until that point. god I miss that little purple dragon.
Barbie: Princess and the Pauper is THE doll movie and no I will not be taking criticisms
YOU NEED TO WATCH BRATZ ROCK ANGELZ
that magic paintbrush looked like a butt plug on a stick
IM WATCHING THIS AT 2 AM 22:10 SKDJEN HELP
oki i levae comment plz dont call me a jerk ToT hehe i like the video :D
15:50 “humanity’s strongest soldier” ☝🏽🤨
but the way i truly loved these as kid omg
finally, the video we all needed.
Wow first video after I subscribed and I didn't get the extra greeting:(
Ya hooo da ba yo
Omg I must have watched that Barbie as rapunzel movie like 1,000 times when I was little, I never realized how awful the animation was
Not getting an extra greeting? AND CALLING ALICORNS flying unicorns. Wow Kurtis, what have you become.
It’s okay kurtis. I’m not mad you didn’t do the extra greeting. Your jokes make up for it 👌🏼
After spending the last 7 days binge watching Barbie films™️, I can confidently say they are more “cinema” than any marvel movie.
what is the point of subscribing if there is no extra greeting
15:54 *B R U T A L.*
No extra greeting? He's changed fellow kurtistown residents. Time to move
i loved chalk zone….
kurtis you’ve just brought up so many childhood memories with this video i think i’m going to faint
Barbie rapunzel was my shit as a kid oh my god
I hate mondandaegs.
not gonna lie, bald kurtis is kind of a hunk
bless you
Dude the barbie movie characters looks like Sims characters
where’s the extra greeting 🥺🥺🥺⁉️⁉️⁉️
ya hooo da ba yo
That bratz movie was my childhood
im more mad about the stache than the extra greeting
With the hair If she's holding it and lowkey holds it a bit up, It's going to bot hurt that much In the disney movie, she has a thing thst helped it, and by the amount it probabky won't hurt that much But a lot of hair would probably fall out
ok im angry cause you CLEEARRLy shouldv'e chosen princess and the pauper, its the best movie of all time
I love when u comment on cinema
Rapunzel wraps her hair around the pole so he isn’t directly pulling on her head
Princess and the Pauper is the best barbie movie hands down!
the bratz babies movie was my personal favorite
Him intentionally not giving us the extra greeting makes me uncomfy💀
1. Scrolltum 2. strippers have perfected the angry twerk (also the full range of emotion twerk but we are especially good at being pissed)
“pega ele, frita ele, faz purê!”
kurtis dancing is my new favorite thing
I was a Bratz girl and owned a few dolls..until my dad gave them away
bratz will always be best
She “looks like what stubbing your toe feels like.” Makes so little sense, it makes perfect sense. Also it’s not just you, the Barbie children are terrifying.
I’m living for the Kelly slander🙏😍
Did you get a new editor? The cuts/edits seem sped up and slightly jarring.
You hired an editor, dude?
Damn, I wanna see Kurtis’ curly hair routine bc those curls are fr poppin
we not gonna talk bout the principal that looks like PC principal from South park
the best barbie movie is diamond castle by far
His videos never miss
HOLY SHIT barbie repunzal gave me so many flashbacks
flying unicorns?? FLYING UNICORNS?! ALICORNS is the word you are looking for.
to be fair i feel like u picked one of the worst bratz movies out the bunch
Kurtis got accused of virginity, so he made the most sexually-charged video possible.
I HAD THE BARBIE HORSE ADVENTURES GAME
Bro, I was obsessed with the barbie movies when I was a kid like holy fuck the nostalgia
Scrotum Scrolls
*reeePUNzeeel is bAAAHHld*
bratz will always be superior literally
*so no hedwig!?*
Oh sure, the minute that I subscribe to get the extra greeting, you don't do it!  Now why did I even subscribe? I'm so disappointed.
Kurtis if you do a barbie marathon ill watch it, we allllll will
Telll me hi twice coward!!!!!
i don’t think i can support you anymore kurtis. hedwig is a girl not a boy 😒
i was WEAK when you copied the girl's aggressive twerking 😭😩
You picked the best two movies in both of the franchises
Ok virgin 🙄🤔
I'm sorry Kurtis but this one feels a little half-assed. I know people are going to be pissed about this video but I genuinely think that the nostalgia and brand loyalty aren't the only reason why. It just seemed rushed and like you didn't pay much attention to either of them and I get that they're just movies but you knew that people cared about them before you went in to it. I wish more time and thought had been spent on this I guess.
Commenting for interaction because I legally can't like after getting no extra greeting and hearing the barbie slander
okay but why does the dragon have human hands
6:35
ya hooo da ba yo
Kurtis!! Watch Barbie in Princess and the Pauper! The brothers Nick and Nack fit your humor so well!
6:24 “HES SO HARD RIGHT NOW!” lmao
I'd literally rather watch Kurtis review movies than watch the actual movies
the most uncomfortable thing about having an unusual name is hearing someone say your name but they’re not talking to you
Dude this video funny as shit
The Princess and the Pauper is the best movie of all time. That Bratz movie looks so funny though now I want to watch a few
ya hooo da ba yo
No extra greeting?! Why am I even subscribed anymore?
alr kurtis pretty sure only virgins forget their extra greetings so🤷‍♀️
This video had no right to be this funny
the evil pixies outfits were fucking amazing
ok but was anyone else obsessed with myscene dolls ??? i swear i could still watch their movies till this day its such an underrated franchise  (ps kurtis this video made me CRY and get chest pains from laughing so hard)
virgins dont do the extra greeting :/
i woke up with a migraine. i had to miss my class. then i napped too long and was late to my hair appointment, wHich did not go well; my hair looks bad now. i then had to go to work, where i’m a waitress. only made 80 bucks the entire shift on a FRIDAY night because it fuckin STORMED and no one came in. after driving for 30 minutes in the raging shitfuck of a thunderstorm, i am now home and tucked in bed.. only to click on this video and be told that i will NOT be getting my EXTRA GREETING ???????????? WTF ??!!?!?!??!! after being subscribed for years.. i am monumentally disappointed kurtis. i could’ve used that shit today. oh and my migraine is back.  THANKS FOR NOTHING KURT 😤😤😭😪🥵🤒😒😠😡🤕🤧🤧💔💔💔
we all just got literally gnomed by a bratz movie
Okay, but what about the potato aliens in Bratz Super Babyz???
You need to watch the live action Bratz movie
barbie movies will always be superior, you should have watched the mermaid barbie movie 😩🥵
smh should’ve watched Barbie fairytopia
Kurtis reviewing a Barbie movie is something I didn't know I needed.
"DOTH THOU CARPETS MATCH THY DRAPES" nshghs one of the funniest thing ive heard all day
kurtis: this is unrealistic evil rave pixie bratz: 👁👄👁
this is literally one of the funniest videos i've ever seen. no joke. i spit out my fucking coffee
Someone had to say it, but Hedwig is a girl, Kurtis
BARBIE WINS IMO IDK IF IM JUST BASED BC ITS ALL I WAS RAISED ON BUT IDC ITS SO COMFORTING AND HILARIOUS TO LOOK BACK ON‼️‼️
Watch the highest rated Barbie and bratz movies and compare those. I swear Barbie has so many good ones
the dad in pixie form kinda sorta looks like human shrek ngl-
My Scene was just superior
I subscribed for the extra greeting 😡
Ya hooo da ba yo
i Would be offended that you didn't mention monster high but i'm okay with it because they're unspeakably superior
not gonna lie, before i started listening to very really good i thought the “VRG” was short for virgo…
but like imagine barbie and bratz together- i mean 👀
I can’t BELIEVE you didn’t pick Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princess movie.   that movie walked so Pixar could run.
No extra greeting? Much sad :( :'(
Mayor Kurtis, the people need you to review more barbie movies. Fairytopia, Nutcracker, Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper. These are classics and comment contenders for best barbie movie🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️
Nice virgin letters Virign
kurtis i respectfully reject your decision
The lips on the britz dolls make there face look like a fish
Check out Sam and Micky they do adult parody centered around Barbie and the Bratz it’s really funny and sad
ya hooo da ba yo
when youre already in the know about the vrg announcement because you're a grandpa and you listen to the podcast -
Man both of these movies are just a full on drug trip
What? No Member's Perks? No extra greeting? Unsubbing...
As a kid my mom never let me play with bratz dolls. So I would watch the movies at my friends and I was obsessed. now I collect all types of dolls including Bratz. but I wanted to say that Barbie a fairy secret is really close to this bratz movie
the way i actually went to get a snack when kurtis told me to lmao
barbie princess and the pauper would've been too powerful and blown all competition out of the water
I loved the Bratz movies, and the fact that I can still name Chloe (Angel), Yasmin (Pretty Princess), Sasha (Bunny Boo), and Jade (Kool Kat) all these years later speaks to how much I loved them as a kid. As for Barbie, I really only remember the movie about the Nutcracker, and even that was just for the giant rat king.
It feels like Kurtis is being held hostage while his virgin uncle is using his account to post videos
I have barbie rapunzel on dvd
HEDWIG IS A SHE YOU FAKE FAN!!!
Kurt you should always do a snack break in the middle of your vids
wood chipper? i hardly know her...
Omg I grew up on Bratz Fashion Pixies 😭
Both lesbian icons
The Barbie Rapunzel was my favorite growing up idk why but I watched it A LOT
me who already watched both the movies also me: *watches full kurtis video to know his opinions*
I was obsessed with Barbie Rapunzel when I was a kid. I had the doll, movie AND computer game.
You're getting funnier, funny man
ya hooo da ba yo
Kurtis: “I’m not a virgin” Also kurtis: 21:27
i grew up with younger sisters and so was exposed to several years worth of both barbie and bratz movies. the barbie movies are way better, usually because theyre based on a preexisting story (nutcracker, rapunzel, prince and the pauper, etc) so theres an actual plot, villains, general conflict. bratz was just bottom of the barrel preteen drama wearing a different thematic hat in every movie. so yeah, barbie ftw.  ps wow, the mustache did come back bigger, bushier, and stinkier than before. kudos

Growing up I loved the Bratz. I had a Sasha doll, I watched the movies, played the games, and I even had a Sasha blanket. I remember there was this one Bratz game on Y8 and the bkgd music was fire. My fav Bratz movie was the Bratz Babyz, I thought they were so cute.
I simply love alllll Barbie and bratz movies. Princess and the pauper though. Thats the Barbie movie to top all movies.
This was such a good video I love the ones like this!
26:32 BALLZ
Sorry kurtis but now that I know you’re not a Barbie stan, I don’t think I can be nice to you anymore 😔
Kurtis absolutely should have watched Princess and the Pauper, that is a top tier Barbie movie!
The letters are also the colours of the asexual flag sooooo…. HAH VIRGIN!!!
Bratz fashion pixies is so iconic but did anyone else watch the monstrosity bratz super babies… horrific
next video is his 200th
"I'm not gonna do the one thing that will easily solve all my problems until I absolutely have to" is the ultimate adhd mood
I didn't pay enough attention to the Barbie movie itself, but in Disney's Rapunzel she wraps her hair around a hook before she throws it down the tower. Therefore the strain is on the hook, not her scalp and neck. Idk why I cared enough to say this, but for some reason my brain has decided this is important. I'm very drunk rn.
Idk why that weasel looks like Freddie Mercury
full offense, you picked the worst barbie movie
you literally watched 2 of my favorite childhood movies
I am assuming the budget on the Barbie movie is pretty high but the animation looks like it was 500 bucks. It is so horrible and creepy.
I LOVED the bratz fairy movie. I used to buy the dolls on eBay lmao
Bro what am I even subscribed for
i want my extra greeting!!!!!!!
When it comes to a punchline there's the first option, then the second option, and what makes some comedians great is they use the third option. Kurt likes uses the first option and it cracks my ass up.
Barbie Rapunzel is in my car DVd player right now.. My kids have watched several times in the last week...now I am going to hate it even more.
sorry kurtis, but i'm gonna have to cancel you now 😡😤 watching one of the worst old barbie movies AND denying us our extra greeting??? that's a big no no
My husband said you look like a skinny Ron Jeremy with the stache ☠️ I’m sorry, but now I can’t unsee it 😆
wow no extra greeting? unsuscribing
EVERYONE CANCEL KURTIS BC OF NO EXTRA GREETING
doth thou carpet match thy drapes??
i feel neglected without a second greeting
do y’all remember barbie princess charm school and all the fairy ones, and the mermaid movies ugh they’re all so good
this is one of the most hilarious videos I have ever seen. Thank you. <3
ok but the barbie movies slap, i still watch them
There’s seriously something to be said for grown men analyzing content created for early 2000’s young girls
I subscribed for the extra greeting and the extra greeting only WTF I’m I supposed to do now ?
That was a very good video
Please make a full song for Repaunzul is Bald Now
Pleeaasseeee do a video on the move life size!!!
I NEED ANOTHER ONE OF THESE WITH BARBIE FAIRYTOPIA AND BRATZ SLEEPOVER ADVENTURE OMG
wbk that Bratz > Barbie
give him to ME-uh     aAUGH🥵💦
Wait did Barbie invent the "Rapunzel is a secret princess" twist that Disney used? bc that's not in the original fairytale - her parents are just normal people who stole from a witch's garden bc the wife had pregnancy cravings so the witch agreed to let the husband take it in exchange for the child. (And the plant he was stealing was rapunzel, hence the name.)  So looked on wikipedia to see if this comes from another variant and (1) doesn't seem to and (2) apparently in the original* (not original original, just the first grimm printing) grimm version she gets found out because she gets pregnant and they changed it to her accidentally asking Gothel why it's harder to pull her up than the prince to make it more kid-friendly....uh....
⚠️ FLASHING LIGHTS FROM 21:35 - 22:01 ⚠️
It’s my birthday and this is probably the best gift I could ask for.
Barbie movies are superior
Kurtis you didnt pick 12 dancing princesses which is the best fucking one
Bratz dolls were superior but I can’t lie, Barbie movies... there’s crack in them and I can’t stop watching them to this day!
Can’t pick loved them both!!
I HAVE FORGOT ABT CHALKZONE SINCE LIKE 2008 WTF
kurtis please watch the bratz super babies movie its fucking terrifying
How dare you give her 4
Now Kurtis needs to do Monster high 👹‼️
Kurtis this is genuinely one of your funniest videos. I haven’t laughed throughout an entire video like this in a long time. Good job king :)
So many memories unlocked from my brain, I remember nothing from my childhood unless I am seeing it again now in adulthood? And it strikes such a strangely familiar nostalgia, I hate and love it
kurtis you should add the weasle moaning to your soundboard.
This was not even a fair comparison because that Bratz movie is the best movie that has ever been created.  Also Leena was like my goth girl awakening
You should make this a series
Bratz >>>> Barbie
You should make this a series
This is the funniest thing I’ve seen all month
Bruh, her friends are the actual bratz cast 😭 Chloe, Sasha, Jade, and Yasmin
Unsubscribed, there is no benefit.
man the only reason why i’m subscribed is for my extra greeting,,, i might have to unsubscribe now 🤧
I can't believe you're referring to the main characters of the entire Bratz franchise as "Cymbeline/Breeana's friends" oh my god
yet another banger kurtis thx
Thanks for skipping the greeting, its actually kinda refreshing.
Well at least we got the Clap
I love your moustache, sir.
i love being able to watch kurtis conner just going at a movie about barbies and criticizing the childs forehead whilst he looks like a dad from the 80's that used to be in a rock band, this just mwah; chefs kiss  You're an absolute doll kurtis
LMAOOOOOO PULLING ON RAPUNZELS HAIR AND IT FELL OFF REVEALIMG HER BALD HEAD ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN SHREK
That brats movie hurt my eyes xD i watched all barbie movies as a kid and it's so much better
Kurtis was CLEARLY Bratz biased from the start. Unfair ranking. Disappointed in this professionalism.
"I'm not gonna do the one thing that would solve all my problems until I absolutely have to" Literally me lol
Unsubbed 40 seconds in cuz NO EXTRA GREETING BYEEEEEE
I get it, my boy. You made this video full of sexual references so we would know you weren't a virgin. It's okay, we accept you. 😭  But really, this video brought back so many great memories. I watched both movies growing up and could remember random parts.
Hedwig is a female owl 😭😭
I felt personally attacked without the extra greeting not gonna lie. I don’t think I realized how important it is to me until now 😅😂
ya hoo da ba yo ;)
No extra greeting? Gonna unsub 👍
Hello Mr. Conner. I am also Mr. Conner.  Good day
omg these barbie movies seem like a fever dream for me
CANCELLED
Ya hooo da ba yo
I literally came here just to see if hes still doing his extra greeting
Unsubbing until I get my extra greeting
Okay while the opinion off of these movies is 100% valid and I agree, Barbie Rapunzel is literally one of the WORST Barbie movies imo. if you looked at one of the better ones, i think ur opinions would be different
I’m glad to see the end of the extra greeting. Get to the video I say!
I remember loving the Rapunzel film, but I DON'T remember the visuals being so clunky!!
barbie movies will always be superior, i don’t make the rules
On that sneeze, bless you.
I’m expecting an apology vid for taking the extra greeting away
this video was really funny. Definitely a close second to the episode series-- possibly takes the cake. 9.8/10.
18:45 outta nowhere 🏃🏽‍♀️
I love u kurtis
You should do a Christmas Barbie movies vid in December! Trust me it'll be soooooo good
Give him to me 😩🥰aAaaAuuuUUuUhhHhHHh🥰😩
hahaha jokes on you my step mom hated all dolls
That Barbie Rapunzel movie was that one movie I watched as a kid. And while you’re growing up, you remember like super specific scenes or characters but couldn’t remember the fuckin origin to them.
God this was so fucking funny dude. I don't usually laugh out loud to youtube videos but this one had me crying laughing more than once. I don't know what kind of drug you put into your jokes today, but it left me wanting for more. Kinda sad when the sponsored part started playing
21:27 this clip is gold
NOT KURTIS MISGENDERING HEDWIG 😱 CANCELLED 🤬
SMALL FORCE!!
Barbie movies are a fever dream
I want Barbie saying "balls" to be my ringtone.
Kurtis I love ya bud but you chose two of the worst movies from both genres😂😂 I good comparison would’ve been the original beats movie and maybe the diamond castle?? THOSE are the good ones lol
Not Kurtis PURPOSEFULLY NOT GIVING US our extra greeting.
Time to cancel him again I guess.
The Barbie repunzel movie is where that god awful weasel came from... he has been flooding my recommended with memes and I’m scared to hell
Kurtis looks like my uncle in pictures from the 80s
the editing on this video is sending me
I only subscribed to get my sparkly extra greeting... Unsubscribed 😭😭😭
how you gonna talk about a barbie movie and have it not be fairytopia 🤨🤨
Bratz 10000% there tv show was awesome they had awesome playstation games no competition
I cannot count how many times I used to rewatch that bratz movie when it came out 😭 I thought it was a masterpiece
Everybody now (ooh) Everybody now (oh) Everybody now (ooh) Everybody now (yeah) Everybody now Everybody now (ooh) Time to show the whole world What we're all about B B B B B B Bratz Everybody now (ooh) Time to show the whole world What we're all about We're the girls with a passion for fashion Ooh Bratz, we'll always be there for eachother Ooh Bratz (yeah) Stylin' how we feel (ooh) Talkin' about best friends (yeah) Together we can do anything (oh) Gotta plan the dream, take a chance to believe Make it real B B Bratz Everybody now  :P
As a kid girl, Bratz movies slapped and Barbie movies felt like they were made for someone else
Unsubscribing. If I’m only gonna get one greeting regardless 😒
the arctic monkeys reference is the best thing ive ever expreienced
Now all I can think about is Curtis reacting to Monster High and Ever After High
shoulda watched barbie fairytopia mermaidia and it woulda changed ur mind with bibble alone
My sister is 20yo and she is still a big fan of Barbie and pretty much watch Barbie films when there's a chance to do so
The clothes that Bratz dolls wore were more um...adult... than Barbies. My parents opted for buying black barbie dolls instead.
no extra greeting...unsubscribed
kurtis...the mustac- nvm
leaving a comment bc it's the law
Thank you for awakening my trauma demons from my childhood. I am digging the bratz and Barbie movies I have. And destroying them like they destroyed my childhood.
shoulda watched nutcracker barbie. Tim Curry played a big evil rat
why you kinda look like justin bieber dude
Barbie and the twelve dancing princesses shaped me into the person I am today
The mic quality 🙀
anrgy at kurtis for NOT choosing the better barbie movies like barbie:- princess and popstar 💔
w e a s e l c u m
Bless you.
The sneeze at the end 😔✊
Whatever the gnome said riding that unicorn made me spray my coffee all over
I was sad that I was caught up on all your videos and then refreshed and NEW VIDEOOO Your content always cheers me up tysm <3
isn't hedwig a woman
WHERE IS MY EXTRA GREETING??!
STOP TALKING ABOUT DOLLS BRO.  THAT SHIT IS NOT NORMAL.  WE ARE MEN WHO LOVE WOMEN.  GET YOUR GAY FLAG OUT MY FACE
How could you do this…… no GREETING?!! I’ll never forgive you
barbie gets my vote
10:15 don't ever go bald please
kurtboy this video has saved my whole week
Where is my extra greeting?
I haven’t even started watching the video yet but I can already tell you that Barbie is the best solely because of Preminger from the Princess and the Pauper 🙏🙌
12:30 you certainly can have a chase scene with no music. No Country For Old Men for example. It’s beautifully done.
I come home from work, eager for Kurtis and his promised extra greeting.  Was it all a lie? I wasn't subscribed when he forgot the extra greeting. I thought it wouldn't be so hard, but I kinda feel a little blue-balled should I say. You sort of stroked us up with your promises of extra greetings, and then you voluntarily deny us the promised extra greeting?? I feel like I've experienced a denied orgasm of content with this one Kurtis pal.   jk lol, you do what you want. Loved the vid Kurtis <3
This vid is too perfect. I was never a barbie movie fan but i LOVED the bratz. Literally was wearing this bratz crop top from hot topic for their 20 year anniversary when I saw this came out. Not only is the bratz movie crazy, but Kurtis is obviously hilarious and then makes and Arctic Monkeys reference.. its literally PERFECT. I was a huge AM fan when I was a teenager, was all into that grunge look and loved them. That was a DOUBLE mfkn whammy, absolutely killed it for me this vid. Kurtis always has awesome vids but this one just HIT for me
It is CRIMINAL that you didn’t pick a Barbie movie with bibble in it
no
did anyone else hear “this is lena. she’s a transvestite.”?????
One time I went camping and as I was walking in search of firewood and I found this bratz doll. It has mattes hair, tire marks, and bite makes all over it; one of the hands and feet was melted too. I left it there cuz I was scared. When I went to the tent later to go to bed, the bratz doll was literally in my sleeping bag ;-; Ik my sister prolly put it in there, but it scared the crap outta me at the time
where is monster high in all this...YOU CANT IGNORE THE FREAKY FAB GORLS
“could a virgin have a podcast?” yes kurtis. u have a podcast.
MyScene gang represent!!!
I literally just subscribed yesterday, what the hell  is this bullshit about not getting a second greeting?!?!
i love how people diss on the animation of bratz, which is troubling to look at at times, yet the earlier barbie movies aren’t too easy to look at either lmao.
Kurtis has insulted us multiple times in this video, no extra greeting?!?!?! Bratz>Barbie?!?!?! it is time to cancel the virgin again
Bless you
ya hooo da ba yo
I’m sorry, but I physically can not watch this without the extra greeting
My sister watched those Barbie movies everytime it was her turn with the tv. I JUST WANTED TI WATCH BIONICLES MAN!
Oh, so I think I gotta unsubscribe becuz the extra greeting services are gone ig
As a black girl, I appreciate Bratz more, but I've seen my fair share of Barbie movies and shows and they're really good. Bratz content is good too particularly Bratz Babiez but they have more representation, that's why I think they are better.
WOM WOM WOM
Disappointed that you didn’t choose the Barbie movie about the 3 musketeers
Kurtis with the mullet and the 'stache gives off some major young Weird Al vibes
The only bratz movie I ever saw was the one where at the end of it they turn into monsters and go into the sewers to live and eat trash???? Tbh writing it down makes me doubt the existence of that movie, it was just so weird. someone please tell me I didn't imagine it
21:38 - 22:21  << this joke had me dying laughing. lmaoo
The shot of Rapunzel-Barbie being saved from falling in the hole made me so uneasy. How did the animators draw this man touching fingertips around an entire woman and not feel gross about marketing this as a reasonable expectation.   Also Kurtis, Hedwig is a girl
You're so funny
Just let go is my favorite bratz song
JFC KURTIS SHOULDVE WATCHED BARBIE AND THE 12 DANCING PRINCESSES
Best Barbie computer game was Super Sports Barbie. You should play it
Guys, I thought that I had my notifications on this whole time, but I didn’t. I am not a true citizen of Kurtistown, and I deeply apologize
I love the music in Barbie as Rapunzal, but you can just listen to OG Dvorak’s 9th symphony
I've watched more Barbie movies but I had more Bratz dolls. I think my opinion of them is that they are equally great
But Hedwig is a female owl!
Kurtis seems kinda biased towards bratz jus saying
“Mattel me that” was the funniest part of this video
Yes I'm here for any chalk zone reference
Omg the booksss ❤️
PLEASE watch a monster high movie next!! they're actually hilarious
This whole time I thought the vrg in the background was for Virgo 🥲
"mattel me that" literally had me gasping 💀
Personally The Diamond Castle, Barbie and the Three Musketeers, and the Twelve Dancing Princesses are the top Barbie movies that have like pretty good plot
this is the boxing match we have all been waiting for
thank you the extra greeting is annoying
Your videos are the funniest thing I've watched in so long. I am in actual tears every night stoned watching you and it makes my whole night so much better dude. Right on
The irl bratz movie was the bomb I've watched it like 5 times bangerrrrrrr
Kelly: shows up on screen Kurtis: GO AWAY SLEEP PARALYSIS DEMON!!!!!!!
At 18:19 the gnome says "nosey cailíní's" which is partially irish gaelic for "nosey girls", but "cailíní" is already plural so idk why he added an s onto it, or why he even bothered saying one word of the sentence in a different language
kurtis really is disrespecting my childhood, barbie movies are superior
aghpk all gnomes have piss kinks
3:06 Naw, fam.  Barbie already had _plenty_ of Black, Hispanic, Asian, etc. versions _way_ before Bratz came out.  I know...because I _owned_ them.  Still had a few lying around until my kids finally broke the last one.  I was a little too old to be interested in dolls by the time Bratz came out, but I found the marketing off-putting, like they were promoting, well...being a _brat._  Barbies were the "You can be anything you want!" doll, but Bratz seemed more like the, "Spend all of Daddy's cash like there's no tomorrow and make duck-faces in all your selfies" doll.  Years later, when I had kids of my own and the girls wanted to watch Barbie movies/shows, I wasn't interested...until I overheard a few, and the writing is _hilarious._  The situations in the series are mostly absurd, and fittingly require absurd solutions, and I quite often catch myself snorting at a random overheard one-liner.  P.S. "People of color" is _so_ freaking cringe, it's just a re-wording of "colored people."  I'm *Black,* not "colored," and while I indeed appreciated _having_ different ethnicity dolls, I didn't _need_ one to feel "included," or whatever.  It wasn't "huge" b/c I am who I am regardless of whether or not a *doll* looks "like me."
ya hooo da ba yo
he left his old intro  for the new one: "I am not a virgin"
I only had like 1 bratz doll and its legs and arms that moved back and forth always got stuck in my hair or pinched me so I think I threw it away and just grew out of dolls 😭
I was not expecting subtle James Charles shade 💀 the fucking “do I wanna gnome” joke sent me too. This is why I love Kurtis
sorry kurtis, monster high dolls always have been and will be the best
how do i like the video twice
Kurtis please watch Barbie’s Princess and the Pauper. It’s the BEST and most loved Barbie movie!!!
Was anyone going to tell me that the dragon was cree summer or was I just supposed to google it myself
NO!!!! YOU DONT UNDERSTAND KELLY'S CHARACTER ARC!!!!!
do i wnna gnomeeee
I bar-fed to every joke
When I was little I had a reoccurring nightmare that I was Kelly, then the wicked witch from the wizard of oz kidnapped me, put me in a cauldron, then pulled me back out as disembodied chicken feet.
Lmao anyone else who used to watch MLP friendship is magic low key go oof when he called those “flying unicorns” and not alicorns?
Bless you
Sad that he didn’t react to bratz kids or barbie 12 dancing princesses
buried memories buried memories
bratz dolls this, barbie dolls that, don’t lie to yourself ever after high and monster high are the superior
I LOVE YOU SO FVCKING MUCH❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😩🤚😩🤚
Kurtis, this ‘no extra greeting’ thing is insanity. I have subscribed to this channel for one reason only. And you just decide to not give an extra greeting to the subs? I’m unsubscribing.
I was never one for dolls as a kid. I was a big Power Rangers fan amd snuck out of my room to watch latenight movies, so I wanted to have cool fighting plotlines and huge dramatic plotlines. In hindsight my issue wasn't with the dolls themselves, it was that no other kids wanted to play the same game with them as me. So I'd settle playing house for a bit and then I'd get bored out of my damn mind and have my Barbie fall off the roof and be like "oh no... she died... later."  By myself, it was fun tho. I think it probably led to my bi/pan awakening, too, because I only had one Ken doll. So I would have the lady Barbies go to bed with each other, too. There would also be whole ass lifetime movies where one Barbie would catch Ken in bed with another Barbie and someone would get murdered and there'd be an investigation or the other Barbies just both dumped him, kicked him out of the house, and got married to each other. Also, lots of spy shit. Like, dolls don't have to be just one thing. They're just a jumping off point. You don't even need dolls. When, I was in the car, I'd do that thing where I'd make my hands walk on two fingers and have martial arts battles lol
Bibble is the powerhouse of the cell.
There was a fairytale version of brats and I was fucking terrified of the wolf
fashion pixies was the best worst nostalgic movie to me
I can't speak on the movies, but Bratz were totally the better dolls. I didn't need a little white doll showing me that girls can be astronauts and scientists, I needed a doll that looked like me. And Bratz had POC dolls within their leading casts, not just as side characters.   Having 5 Bratz is a great choice, because they can cover s variety of skin tones. But they're just one Barbie; everyone else is secondary.
BARBIE SUPERIORITY
I thought the letters stood for very rad guy
Alright, thats it. I'm unsubbing. Kurtis didn't do the thing.
"does thy carpet match thy drapes" had me dead
BALLS SCROLLS SKSKKSKSK
also know as "scrollums"
Also for anyone who lOVED this video and the topic, there’s a channel called Aaron and Joe and they’ve reacted to a lot of Barbie movies and they’re hilarious :)
pls shave the stache curry
oh my god i just realized lena was a huge influence on how i look now
just got through the first 45 seconds and man this is the best intro you’ve had   either that or im used to non-scripted twitch/vrg content so this was just a reminder how funny you are
this is actually the best video on youtube
GIVE US THE EXTRA GREETING. NYEOWWW ‼️‼️‼️‼️
Barbie Rapunzel had nothing on Barbie Princess & the Pauper ✊🏻😔
Somehow I have watched most of the Barbie🧚‍♀️ movies especially all the movies that came before 2017.
Now THIS is the content I have to watch.
I still drink out of my very authentic barbie repunzel cup
Now that he mentions the letters in the back, I must admit that looks like he means "verga". Which means "cock" in México... I've seen plenty people writing that word just like that to make it short: VRG. And the merchandising of the podcast looks great, but I wouldn't use that in public.
every time i wear my very really good tshirt my friends say "virg" 😔 this is your fault kurto
Dang maybe I just play too many video games, but @6:28-@6:32 feels entirely too much like a scene from Skyrim
WHY IS KURTIS SO UNHINGED IN THIS VIDEO PLEASEEE KURITS ARE YOU GOOD
you are literally the only YouTube creator that has me cackling out loud almost nonstop with your content. I legit cry laugh. These videos are therapeutic. I feel like a happier person after I watch, thank you :)
I was a big fan of monster high dolls! I miss you
I was absolutely in love with Barbie Rapunzel as a kid and I will not listen to any slander against it.
Well, I'll be unsubscribing then, if you're not giving me my extra greeting. That's what I subscribed for
I...this video was life changingly funny.
Out of all the barbie movies you could have picked...
I never had bratz dolls, BUT I LOVED THE MOVIES AND SHOW, and strangely enough I never liked Barbie movies but had Barbie dolls
Barbie movies can get INSANE I’d love to see kurtis react to more
Bratz vs Barbie? Sorry I’m a myscene girl
2:46 "Mattel me that huh" 😂
Dude I’ve been listening to Barbie music lately and crying at 1am singing them because I’m 18 now, the timing is impeccable
I love how Kurtis just refers to the main Bratz cast as “Brianna and friends” throughout the whole thing....as if the ‘and friends’ aren’t the very people that the entire franchise is centered around 😭
22:10 Eddie Murphy
Barbie a fashion fairytale goes so hard though...  Just not hard like that weasel or anything...
Is anyone else getting adds for the space jam movie non-stop thats not skippabale
bratz fashion pixiez was the direct inspiration for accidentally creating a little cult in my childhood
Oh my god thank you for reminding me about chalk zone  YAh goTtA drAw SUMtHIn, RUdY!
i used to love the fashion pixiez movie specifically because the one girl had the same name as me so i liked hearing them say my name all the time
The lack of the second greeting has wounded me
Delete your podcast because people think your a butt crack
If I don't get an extra greeting, what's the point in being subscribed?
Stop making so many sex jokes it’s insane you’re way too dirty minded
Oh look a virgin with a mullet that didn’t do an extra greeting
This video was a banger, I laughed through the whole thing!
you are making the videos I want to see
When I tell you that bratz movie was my ENTIRE CHILDHOOD
I grew up with and loved both but, bratz movies hit different ngl
Bratz was my childhood and the show is comedy gold
ya hooo da ba yo
My daughter grew up on barbie movies and I gotta say her father and I kinda enjoyed them too.  Mermaidia was my daughters favorite. Lol Barbie's so much better then Brats!
yea both are amazing but the barbie moves like princess and the pauper, island princess and rapunzel was the best fever dreams ever... and give him to me AuGh
that bratz movie was literally one of my favorites when i was a kid.
#kurtisiscancelled
wow youre 27?? what are you like 40 geesh
i think i would kill to see kurtis react to bratz super babyz
Unsubbed bc no xtra greet
barbie swan lake was the best. i like the person who said “you’re thinking daddy” really seductively to her dad
Ah, Nintendo 64 movies, my favorite
i don’t need this penelope slander 😐😐 she can’t fly barbie out of the castle because she’s afraid of heights and gothal put a magical barrier up that she can’t fly over… duh
its a crime you didn't watch the best piece of cinema ever made in history, barbie as princess and the pauper
That was a really funny video, thank you for putting time into that!
this just unlocked a memory of my childhood  i completely forgot about that bratz movie
FOLKS
if there is ever a part 2 Bratz Rock Angels has to be on the lineup thats the bratz movie
Ouch Kurtis I am subscribed for a reason and not getting an extra greeting hurts my heart
YOU SHOULD HAVE WATCHED BARBIE PRINCESS AND THE PAUPER Rapunzel is like at most the 9th best barbie movie
Listen listen listen. In retrospect the barbie rapunzel movie is ridiculous yes. But hear me out.... the sound effects are so strangely satisfying. Like the footsteps and the clinking of metal, etc
OH MY GOD I never liked Barbie as a kid  but GOD does this bring back memories of Bratz.
Please watch the my scene dolls movies
This bratz movie was my sister and I's WHOLE LIFE
10:15 hairless kurtis💀😭
Polly Pockets gang wya???
the barbie movies Slapped, no argument there
bratz😝
Monster high vs bratz?
I really wish kurtis would have watched the baby bratz movie
please please please watch sleep over adventure the bratz movie.
bratz are definitely better fashion-wise and diversity-wise
brazy dolls are superior, barbie movies are superior. if you liked brats dolls (and ESPECIALLY monster high dolls), you’re gay now. sorry, i don’t make the rules…   yes this is a callout post on myself
the barbie rapunzel movie was my shit growing up it's so sad to see how much it doesn't hold up lol
i unsubscribed because you promised me an extra greeting but lied. scammer
I'm bummed Kurtis didn't watch Barbie Swan Lake or Barbie in the Nutcracker because the original ballet movies are the best of the Barbie movies (fight me Princess and the Pauper stans). Also the Barbie Princess Bride CD-ROM game slaps so hard I do a play through every year and it's always fresh
“i think my outfit is pretty gorg💅😌” “uh, raquelle, do you mean gorg-ilicious or gorg-tastic?” “no, BARBEEEEE, gorg, as in gorgeous” is my fav barbie scene ever. the way raquelle says “barbieeee” will always be funny to me
the only barbie movies i had were diamond castle and thumbelina but you bet your ASS i watched that shit RELIGIOUSLY
Bratz 4 lyfe
“Give him to me…uuugh😩”
The Bratz games on GameCube slapped and nobody can change my mind.
All that just so Kurtis could say one was better smh
Hedwig is a she
I lost it every time he started dancing 🤣
At the age if 24 I’m still a Barbie girl! Definitely Barbie has made a huge change in the dolls body shapes to be more realistic .
everyone can pack it up... "do i wanna gnome" is the peak of comedy. it doesn't get much better.
You dare put this out before Jenny Nicholson can drop her Barbie manifestso. Bold strategy i love it
The Barbie movies were my crack growing up and now I realize they were horrible
ya hooo da ba yo
kurtis talking through one of my favorite barbie movies is something i never thought i would see but i am livinggggggg (oh also barbie is the obvious winner, i haven’t finished the video yet but still😌)
Kurtis please watch the live action Bratz movie on Netflix PLEASE
I also loved Princess and the Pauper, the 12 dancing princesses, and swan lake.
my mom didn’t let me watch bratz because she thought it encouraged bratty behavior
quentin tarantino was robbed
Scrolltums.
Just ditch the extra greeting mate. I’m getting the feeling you are really sick of it and I bet it got tedious to recite pretty fast
Rioting for the second greeting I subbed to feel special 💥👊
Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper is so much better than the Rapunzel one!
EXTRA GREETING DAMNIT
It upsets me that he chose the most forgetful barbie movie, and the best Bratz film.   Princess and the popper to this day is legendary.
I’ve only scene Repunzle once but I was obsessed as a kid with the Barbie of Swan Lake and Nutcracker.  I still have them on VHS(half of y’all won’t even know what that is). 😅  Bratz I loved to play with but was not a fan of the shows because they didn’t match the personalities I gave them lol 😂 I also had like 3 sahas and two chloes so I had to improvise 😅🤣
Prime opportunity for “Sighorny Weasel” smh
DOTH THOU CARPETS MATCH THY DRAPES
Bratz vs Barbie vs MH? Monster high is the best IMO buttt
i cant remember the last time i saw a youtube video that made me laugh this much and the only things i laughed at were B A L L S and that fucking noise the weasel made.
PSA: Kurtis is now my favorite virgin
Kelly’s forehead is larger than my student loans
No extra greeting? Then what’s the point of subscribing
I’m high watching this right now and that “do I wanna gnome?” part was surreal
Bro did anyone else have Liv dolls?
"I'm not going to do the one thing that will solve all my problems until I absolutely have to" - me
If you don’t like old Barbie movies (specifically, Barbie and the 12 Dancing Princesses) you’re um… a bad person and I’m not afraid to fight. That’s all.
kurtis i am crying. i am sobbing. i am in tears. i cannot believe that i have dedicated the entire click of a button to you by subscribing and i am not being compensated for that. this is despicable. i hope twitter has a field day with you buddy.
Kurtis wtf you unlocked a memory in my brain I didn’t even know I had of watching that bratz movie once like over a decade ago…
This takes me back. I loved a few Barbie movies here and there but the Bratz movies were my jam. Bratz Rock Angels and Bratz Diamonds were my favorites.
Do a video on Chalk Zone!!! And if you can find the old flash game, even better
Barbie The Princess and The Pauper is a complete and udder masterpiece
I've been betrayed. To withhold my extra greeting is downright abhorred behavior, I feel lost now
Okay but Bratz: Rock Angelz really should have been the movie chosen and Im sad that it wasnt. The four main Bratz arent the main characters in the Fashion Pixie one :(
Man bratz fashion pixies was my movie  I love how when Chloe and Yasmin see the girl get wings for the first time they immediately are like “she’s a pixie!” Instead of like, “bitch got butterfly wings wtf!” Also I will not stand for the bratz being referred to as And Friends and not their names
Mans watched one of the worst Barbie movies and called it a good review
Seeing Charli XCX at Wynwood pride and a new video? Best day of my life. 😭
B A L D K U R T I S C O N N O R
25:19 chipper? i hardly know her
Anyone else think he should've done barbie a fairy secret? Cause these movies have the same plot
ok but barbie the princess and the pauper?  slappp. the barbie movies made my childhood and I have them all on dvd even though I admittedly only had brats dolls and spent my entire childhood playing the bratz video games
Hey Kurtis! Do you remember those old Canadian childerens PSA’s, like the house hippo one? They have a YouTube channel, ccacanada, I think it would be awesome if you made a video on them
i'm sorry but the Rapunzel is baalldd nooww really got me
That gnome scene just gave him flashbacks to being chased by crazy Minecraft zombie babies
This is the video I didn’t know I needed but definitely did need
best video you’ve ever made i swear
28:50 mins of kurtis roasting kelly to literal death me being named kelly but watching anyway bc “live love kurtis”: 👁👄👁 💜💜
I kinda like the moustache. The moustache is growing on me. I mean not growing ON me but like you know
My little sisters would watch Bratz and Barbie movies growing up, so I would see bits and pieces over many years. I'm actually surprised how much I remember. But the Bratz movies were way better.
Kurtis this was quite a funny video
Why did you unlock these memories from my childhood
Pegasus, Kurtis. Not flying unicorns, they are PEGASUS 🙄
I'm unsubscribing. This is disgusting. How dare you not give me the extra greeting that you PROMISED every subscriber would get! The audacity. Do better.
leaving a comment cuz i dont wanna be a jerk
barbie to me is superior mostly because i watched every movie and read every book but i do like the diversity bratz had
I wish that Fashion Pixies wasn’t the Bratz movie he watched, it’s so bottom tier
the only reason i liked bratz more is because i remember thinking they were the same color as me. plus i liked their clothes more. dude thats bratz movie was a drug trip. it was amazing.
I was so in love with Bratz as a kid it’s crazy, had a blanket, dolls and everything 😭 and the MUSIC😭
watch barbie princess and the pauper and then come back and talk to me...
Kurtis picking some of the worst movies from those franchises
I need you to see the elephant Teeka from Barbie The Island Princess
BEFORE I LISTEN TO HIS TAKE!!! As a child I would replay the SHIT out of Barbie  rapunzel on VHS and I understand that it’s probably not that great without the childhood nostalgia, but I appreciate that movie a lot
saying youre not a virgin before giving us an extra greeting AND REFUSING TO GIVE US AN EXTRA GREETING is the most virgin thing to do
Why have I watched both of these movies
What an excellent video.  I’m in awe
Litterally me haveing a huge forehead:)
10:05
Kurtis just rage quit his 2nd greeting. A gimmick he made. This was his choice. Like that mustache......
Wait.. why did I sang "Do I wanna gnome?" with Kurtis, I didn't even know it was coming lol
I feel attacked
the way he chose like the worst barbie movie😒
The mom seemed a bit stiff
i did not realize how empty i feel inside from kurtis not doing the extra greeting
This is a classic
Glad you're doing what you want, instead of what idiots demand. You are more than an extra greeting man
give him to meeee 😩eughhh😩
kurtis would enjoy the movie Barbie diaries and Barbie life in the dream house 😂
Thank you current for sponsoring this *current* video
Bratz movies and dolls have always been better. I owned both and I love Barbie but Bratz have always been more relatable for me as a poc. They actually had sass and personality. Mattel tried to combine Barbie and bratz with my scene which was a cute attempt because the style was cute but bratz had everything. Also Barbie movies were entertaining because they’re so bad and it’s comical. Bratz movies were entertaining because they were entertaining. I actually owned a Barbie repunzel doll and a bratz fashion pixie.  The fashion pixies is one of the best bratz movies. But the princess and the pauper is one of the funniest Barbie movies.
omg literally do anymore barbie or bratz reviews this is my new favourite form of content
scrolltums
as a 22 year old woman, i absolutely love the barbie movies. they are *chefs kiss*. Princess and the Pauper? iconic. Barbie in the 12 Dancing sisters? Unforgettable. Barbie in the Three Musketeers? Motivating. Barbie in a Mermaid Tale? Amazing. I could go on. BUT! Bratz wasn’t just inclusive but honestly so fucking progressive. Their style isn’t “picture perfect” like barbies. And it’s important to show kids that. You don’t have to fit into the “normal” to have friends.
Good to see its not just Aaron and Joe with the barbie kids slander
18:46 💀☠😂 the layers
The fact that you didn’t even mention Barbie life in the dreamhouse
I am sad didn't get the greeting everything is wrong :'c
fun fact: If barbie was a real living person, she would have to walk on all fours like a dog, due to her unrealistic body proportions.
I SUBSCRIBED & I WANT MY EXTRA GREETING
BALD KURTIS
Great going guys you called him a virgin now he doesn’t do the extra greeting
idk how to word this but the way there are good and bad “pixies” (fairies) feels strangely homophobic
I have actually read all the barbie books when I was 10 and I had loved them .
I'm totally okay, Cause I had two barbies one was black, another fair. I loved both of them. And you know I Don’t think you should plump your lips and ass because barbie or bratz has it. If you do it, You're abnormal. 👁️👄👁️.
Petition to have Kurtis watch the Bratz baby superhero or sleepover movies because those gave me nightmares man
Sigourney weasel
The AUDACITY to not give us a second greeting, and so rudely, I might add.
I cannot begin to tell you how many times I watched Barbie as Rapunzel as a kid. Seeing it blow up as a meme has given me so much nostalgic joy
Watch Barbie Life in the Dream House and Barbie: Fairy Secret, they’re so good
"Kelly looks like what stubbing your toe feels like"
im one minute and thrity-three seconds in. hey man, whats going on
So you’re telling me now I need to worry about Crows stealing my stuff? 🤦🏾‍♀️
The knocked-off Arthur theme song had me dying
Now i gotta look like this 3:04
I loved toy soldiers, it would be fun to see a review!
this is literally my dream video
that was my FAVORITE bratz movie growing up 😭
the bratz town kinda looks like westview from wanda vision  *coincidence?*
I’m sorry kurtis, but those “flying unicorns” are actually alicorns. If you want me to be a part of kurtistown, you have to keep up with your horse lore. Otherwise, your gonna be cancelled 😡
acccctuaaaaallyyyyyyy, if the sound production is done well action scenes without music can be chef's kiss good
i'm guessing kurtis actually shaved his head for that bit and idk if ill see it for the next video but that looks too real lol
18:01 20:55 Kurtis’ faces had me☠️😭
The bratz soundtrack destroyed barbie
No joke, though. Life in the Dreamhouse is hilarious and way too self-aware. I was babysitting, and the kids were watching it, and I was so pleasantly surprised.
Kurtis I think if you watch other Barbie movies you would enjoy any of the Fairytopia movies, Princess and the Pauper, and Swan Lake. I recommend the old movies because the writing was better than the newer movies they put out.
Arctic monkeyssssss
Please watch the first bratz movie, bratz the video starrin & stylin you can find it on YouTube lmaoo
Kurtis. Where’s my extra greeting? That is very really not good.
damn i was going to say there are so many other barbie movies that are more exciting than rapunzel but the moaning weasel was way too fucking funny to have replaced it
My best friend in primary school had the Barbie Rapunzel doll, WITH the ball dress omggg AND she had the three kids as well and I was so jealousssss!!!!
Damn I wish you would've watched Barbie Princess and the Pauper 😭 at least there's a spongebob reference though so god bless
not Kurtis destroying my childhood )':  im brocken
Wow Kurtis is a virgin and he's 27 just wow
"BrAtZ dOLlS aRe SlUtTy" ya and Prince Stephen just wrapped his hands around barbie's ENTIRE WAIST! HER WHOOLLEEEE WWAAIIISSSTTTTT BARBARA 🗣🗣
wait if gothal casted the spell why couldn't she just undo it?
Kurtis dancing like one of the Bratz characters makes me so happy
No extra greeting... wtf kurtis that always makes my day 😭😭😭
"no hedwig"  "do I wanna gnome"  That's it. I'm moving out of Kurtistown.
The do I wanna gnome joke was high quality and you should not apologize for it 😤
Can I please get a Dylan is trouble and Kurtis?
Kurtis, I'd like some more barbie movie reviews. This was so fucking funny I can't
Omg this was my F A V O R I T E Barbie movie growing up!!!!!! 🤣😭
that weasel was bussin the whole time
Ok, but you can't have a video about Barbie movies without mentioning Fairytopia, Diamond Castle, and Princess and the Pauper.
I saw the community flag you slipped in Kurtis
The Barbie nutcracker is the best movie
my mom didn't let me have any bratz dolls because she didn't want be to think being a brat was cool ...?
I really needed an extra greeting today😪 but good for you boss🤩
Kurtis out here asking the real questions but he forget the winx girls
I watched the barbie movies a lot as a kid, and I gotta say, Rapunzel was, like, my least favorite. You should have watched Princess and the pauper, I think. But there's honestly too many barbie movies, though.
LMAAAAAAAOOOOO
hey kurt i don’t know if it’s just down right now but the link for Current isn’t working. tells me its not available in my region (alberta😔)
More Barbie movies.... they get WAY weirder
Barbie movies were my entire childhood. I still think the older ones hold up to this day. Not sure about the new ones.
my mom didn’t let me watch bratz bc of what they were called, she thought they’d make me bratty🧍‍♀️but she bought my a bratz doll hahaha
Barbie movies are my shit it’s an addiction
this had to be the video that i watched with my family 😁😁😁😁😁😁
"i get a lot of action now" at 0:44 should have been followed by '"a very really good' thing that i used to do with my friend" . that was the only continuation that i accept ! cancelled
The nail polish totally makes up for the lack of an extra greeting 😈
where is the extra greeting this is not allowed kurt pls bring it back bc i will not hesitate to unsubscribe pls mayor kurt ily too much for this ok bye
This is such a revolutionary video.
Do not slander Penelope’s name! She was scared of heights and couldn’t fly because of her fear. She went through amazing character development of learning how to be a mighty dragon! If I would cancel you for anything it would be for insulting Penelope like that
this was my favorite bratz movie when i was younger!!!! i loved the video kurtis🥰
FASHION PIXIEZ WAS MY FAVOURITE BRATZ MOVIE
Bratz forever diamonds is probably the best bratz movie... and the bratz in Paris special is great
Kurtis, I'm gonna need a follow up: Barbie vs Bratz vs MyScene
yooo was that a community reference
stop because i absolutely love the barbie movies even as a 15 yo girl sophmore. theyre such a masterpiece.
Me: An intern at Mattel  Management lady on first day: And we're suing Bratz because it's our property technically and they're encouraging young girls to be sluts 0_0 (Also only place I've ever worked that had a weirdly strict dress code)
The editing is gold
This man went from Steve Buscemi to Freddie Mercury with a mullet clearly making him mayoral perfection and the only one with the rights to be a said mulleted mayor
testescrolls
this video has no reason to be so funny
Could a Virginia have that mustache?
Bald Kurtis isn’t real he can’t hurt you. Bald Kurtis: 10:15
Bratz were my jam and I even had the giant heads to practice doing hair.
"Why stay on topic when you can simply not?" (1:27) what a mood
Small Soldiers. THAT is a fuckin memory you brought up from the depths of my childhood trauma
The My Scene doll movies were what I distinctly remember loving. The only Barbie movie I somewhat liked was Swan Lake. Now I loved all of the My Scene stuff. I loved collecting the one doll and my favorite was the beach themed one because she smelled like coconut.
kurtis if you don't shave your mustache i'm going to commit arson.    /j
Dude I used to watch the Bratz one all the time when I was a kid
DISLIKED!! 😡😡🤬🤬☺️ I NEED MY EXTRA GREETING! UNSUB GRRR 😡
No extra greeting? Wow Kurtistown has changed... 😢
Barbie and Bratz would definitely be friends I think
the only reason i subbed was for the second greeting
MONSTER HIGH THOOOO
As a boy, I’d use Barbie dolls to fight my with my sister like swords, so they’re the superior toy to me. Also the movies are ironically and rarely unironically hilarious
I think watching this video just unlocked a memory I didn't know I had of watching that barbie movie. I distinctly remember that hairbrush turning into a paint brush bit.
500 or 5,000
Bratz are superior, always loved them more than  Barbie growing up! 😂
7:52 i'm sorry but stephen/stefan's (however you spell it) hands gripping her waist like that out of the blue makes me so uncomfortable lmao
the angry twerking bit, ive never laughed so hard holy shit please
Is he saying “Yahoo I’m a gnome?”
honestly that one bratz movie where they had to face their fear or whatever was like a fever dream to me. like holy shit are you telling me that when one of them with the mirrors was pulled in wasn’t going to give you nightmares??
both of them
but bratz rock angels even had the matching computer video game 🤪
Kurtis I'm sorry but barbie horse adventure isn't a video game. It's THE video game
no fucking way he INTENTIONALLY left out the extra greeting. as a dedicated citizen of kurtistown, i am feeling VERY betrayed.
Should have watched bratz babies 😂😂
i can never choose between them bc i grew up with both.  i had hoards of bratz and barbie dolls/sets along with the movies.
bratz pixiez is elite tho
The title of this video should be a video game
Kurtis, you should do a video on Jacob Two-Two
Thank you for unlocking my childhood memories of Chalk Zone
KURTIS WATCHB 12 DANCING PRINESSES
just saying, i think kurt should’ve compared movies from the same year or something, like barbie fairytopia and this bratz movie would’ve been more comparable
I wasn't allowed to do a lot of things as a kid because my father sexualized everything, Bratz dolls were a big one. I wasn't even allowed to play with them at other kid's houses
I knew I needed this
is no one going to mention the, “rApUnZAl is BalD nOwWww”😭😭🤚🏾
kinda hurt ngl 😃👍
0:45 sounds like something a virgin would say #sus 🤨🤨
*unsubs because I didn't get my extra greeting*
Monster high and bratz were extremely diverse from the very beginning and they had actual personality
Hiiiii
Ok but the bratz live action movie is literally one of my favorite movies ever
I WANT MY EXTRA INTRO!!!!!1!!!!
wood chipper? i hardly know her
if you haven’t watched princess and the pauper and 12 dancing princesses you’re definitely missing out
I needed this thank you
That mustache makes him look like a 70's porno cop.
ok this is a nitpick but why didn't they just have the family heirloom BE A PAINTBRUSH? having it transform from a hair brush to a paint brush was so unnecessary and weird lol
Also please for the love of yee make a video about chalk zone
Anyone want to hear a joke? I used to work at a blanket factory, but it folded! Hahaha
kurtis should react to bibble
KURTIS CAN WE TALK ABOUT MOSTER HIGH
No extra greeting...nice 😁
how dare you not give me my extra greeting.
Bratz and Barbie freaked me out as a kid and they still freak me out
not having the second greeting sent me into the twilight zone
I won't take this Penelope slander!!! She is disabled!!! She struggles to fly!!!! how dare
it’s confirmed. kurtis can pull of the bald look.
I still want Kurtis to react to more Barbie movies!
man i really miss when he used to give us that extra greeting, feels like so long ago
Just absolutely busting a move 😂😂
the way as a child i didnt give two shits about the body proportions of barbie or bratz i just bought them cuz they were pink and aesthetically pleasing to a 4 yr old's eyes
when i was younger i felt guilty because i loved the dark pixie party song and thought the other ball was lame  now that i’m older my feelings are still the same minus the guilt. i’ll gladly angrily twerk in a dark pixie lair under a tree to that song.
): this is what life has become... waking up every morning to the sickly planet we live on... living like hamsters in a hamster wheel... going to school or work then coming back to the loneliness of ur home to then NOT get ur extra greeting from the one and only Kurtis Conner! Life has let me down many times before but this! This  is what I call *pain*
i remember dylan so vividly from the video game <3
oh you _know_ that when i was a kid i thought old barbie movies were the _absolute_ shit
The gnomes were the breakout star of this vid
Bratz is often critiqued for having really severe body types. Eugenia C. mentioned multiple times that she used to really like Bratz dolls when she was a kid. I liked them too, and I really enjoyed them, but man I just can't justify how they affect kids.
this video is very important
I'm very disturbed because I've been having this discussion with my barbie-raised and bratz-raised friends for the past month
Ok, but hear me out... Ever After High
Fun fact that I learned recently, Anjelica Huston voices Gothel in the Barbie movie. Another fun fact, Martin Short voices Preminger in Barbie Princess & the Pauper and it's fantastic
Tell me why when he didn’t do an extra greeting I felt so sad :(
I wonder what his girlfriend thinks when he’s recording his videos??? Am I the only one?
as a little black girl playing with bratz and seeing the diversity and having dolls that look like me made me so happy and i mean THE OUTFITS, bratz was 10000% better, barbie could never  💅🏾
When you said they have attached Barbie's name to everything, I automatically started looking around my room at my stuff to be like, "oh, a Barbie so and so". And my eyes fell on my TV, so I went "haha, Barbie TV." Then I realized they did make Barbie TVs. So... Point proven, Kurtis.
Team Barbie all the way 💪
Lol the angry twerking bratz doll will NOT leave my head!! Lmaoo
When I subscribed to this channel, I was promised an extra greeting. I’m sorry but I’m gonna have to unsubscribe due to false advertising :/
My boi Kurits deems Bratz the winner but refers to them as friends of the fairy characters smh 🙃🤣 just jokin but no lie i had to figure out who he was referring to only to realize he meant my girls Sasha, Jade, Yazmin and Cloe. AND OMG BARBIE RAPUNZEL WAS MY FAVORITE 😭
I’m so glad Kurtis chose Rapunzel-
Bratz is SUCH a huge part of my childhood! Like if you can relate. I had all the dolls and all the games and all the movies lmaoo!
who is going to ask me how it is going now?
1:26 my brain every second
I loved chalk zone
I’ll be right back   🏃🏻🏃🏻🏃🏻🏃🏻🏃🏻🏃🏻🏃🏻
the only bratz movie i can vividly remember is the one where they are in a fair and the girl gets on a horror ride and gets chased by these blob monsters idk tbh but it scared me when i was younger
After seeing him getting more and more tired of the extra greeting, it was nice seeing him let it go. I bet it's so freeing for him to put that phase of his career in his past and move onto a phase where he can be his completely authentic self. Proud of you Kurtis!
this is the hardest i've laughed in months. thank you for this
Good for you, Kurtis. You can not do the usual intro. if you don't want to. It was getting boring anyway ♥️
Monster High was where it was at
Bratz dolls are just the average Instagram influencer
nah cause you picked a lame Barbie movie 😩. You gotta watch at least 5 more 😛
the bratz movie seems like the best movie to drug trip to
CHALK ZONE REFERENCE??? Blessed
Kurtis must review a monster high movie or face the consequences
Kurtis seems like the type of guy who owns a peepy plushie.......
why kurtis kinda look like the weasel from the barbie rapunzel movie 😭
Ya hooo da ba yo .-.
Good, I don’t want your extra greeting. It was fake anyway. You’re not happy to see me. You don’t even know me. I’m just a number on a screen to you you FAKE. MANIPULATIVE. FUCK.   Anyhoodle, great vid! 👍🏻 see ya next time!
I'm glad he did a classic Barbie movie but did a lame Bratz movie.  Rock Angelz or nothing.
Rapunzel’d dragon looks like a poor man’s Spyro
Daaaaaamn that fuckin Monster Rancher shrine sound effect tho... right in the balls.
I feel like butterfly glasses are like drugs and like nothing was real but like they took to many drugs
Barbie has a superior resume. Can’t count her out.
I was literally hoping and praying that kurtis would review the Halloween spooky bratz doll movie
please watch barbie life in the dream house
i saw that community reference
I had a DVD of Barbie as Rapunzel that I watched an absurd amount of times. But I had to leave a sleepover one time when my mom found out that they were going to watch a Bratz movie. Apparently Bratz was like… too hardcore or something
BUT AS A CHILD BARBIE WAS MY FUCKING LIFE LOLL
you should watch the bratz spooky sleepover movie it’s a fever dream 😭
Liv Dolls were lowkey where it’s at i wonder what happened to them
All I heard was the noise Mario makes when he collects a new star in super Mario 64.
23:36 to 23:47 got me laughing more than I have in weeks.   Also- let’s talk about Kurtis’ editing? So amazing. I listen to the podcast too so whenever I hear him talk about how much stress he’s under, its like I definitely appreciate the effort he puts in a lot more now. Thank you Kurtis for making each day better for us :)
Do another video and pit two other Barbie and Bratz movies against each other!
I had Bratz and Barbies but when I played dolls the Bratz would take over all my Barbie stuff and kick them out because their cooler 😎😈👻
KURTIS WATCH PRINCESS AND THE PAUPER PLZ
look at that fucking stache bro
i do indeed want to see more videos like this, yes
my next door neighbor whos parents told mine she wasnt allowed to watch Scoobydoo was a barbie movie girl, i was more of a bratz girl, and i loved Scoobydoo
Regarding the Rapunzel hair thing, I actually rly like how Disney's Tangled made like a hook for her hair to dangle on to so the weight doesnt rely on her head, but instead on the tower itself
This barbie movie was repressed in my memory thank u for bringing it back
give him to me æügh
Hear me out.....Ever after high dolls.....
I’ve always been more of a bratz girl😎
This is the first time I’m not agreeing with one of Kurtis’s video conclusions cause barbie movies (including this one) were a huge part of my childhood. Even those small clips got me kinda nostalgic! But I liked his stupid jokes so it’s all cool 😂💕
The mom's words should have been, "I can't beLEAF you broke the spell." Missed opportunity 😒
kurtis please do more of these, I'm begging you the neighbor called the cops there's children crying pigs are on fire we NEED MORE
As someone who was once a little girl who looked very similar to Kelly in the forehead and had many, many Kelly dolls, shame on you Kurtis.  You’re just jealous we have bigger, more intimidating noggins than you.  Don’t be a virgin, Kurtis 😤
i’m going to make “rapunzel is bald now” my ringtone
23:40 this made my day XD
meh not the best barbie movie but ok
i used to make youtube videos with my bratz in 2006 when I was 10, so I feel SEEN.
does anyone else laugh way too hard after Kurtis makes a really corny joke
Kurtis looks like a southern uncle and I'm scared
Kurtis I’m on shrooms rn I can not handle this much direct eye contact
Should have picked Barbie Mermadia. Bibble goes hard
Can’t believe Kurtis named his podcast after his virginity
Jokes on Kurtis cause we all know the best doll company movies are the MyScene Doll movies
i love it ! great
excluding the extra greeting was definitely _bold_ but i honestly don't hate it
omg the barbie repunzel movie made me so nostalgic
🎵rEpUnzEL iS baLD nOw🎵
Kurtis and Barbie?! Yes please!
thank you for not leaving me an extra greeting.
this video feels 10% more chaotic than usual but i’m here for it
oh god i totally forgot about that bratz movie until today
b.. but... my scene. 😪
I love the foot steps in the fight since it reminded me of nicki the queen of rap
Mattel’s stocks plummet
Kurtis please watch every barbie movie and rank them so Kelly can haunt you forever
if i don’t get an extra greeting then what am i subbed for
i feel like the detail in the bratz animation was 99% focused on making their hair as shiny as humanly possibly and 1% focused on everything else
Unrelated to the context of this video but- I’m still mad over the fact that Monster High Dolls have been discontinued. To me, the movies and dolls were better than barbies and bratz for sure. (And we definitely deserve an apology for that kurtis 😭)
mustache for authority
Did anyone play the Barbie game where you had to like jump over things in like weird places and if so what was it and how do I play it again lol
The fact that I am offended he didn’t watch the second Barbie movie princess and the pauper ...... gotta say bratz is a better doll maybe but that movie def. takes the cake
i'm literally turning this off for not getting my extra greeting. the disrespect is UNBELIEVABLE
When you said you watched Barbie Repunzel my first thought was "omg he's gonna love the weasel"
my fav part is when kurtis said he doesn't have any daughters bc he is a virgin
I think the only reason I like barbie more is because those, and disney movies, were all we had on vhs tapes so those were the only things I watched for a really long time. princess and the popstar, island princess, and rapunzel are definitely my favorite ones
I loved Bratz and Barbie 🥰
Kurt this video was a hit💯👨🏿‍🦲
Give me my god damn extra greeting. I SUBSCRIBED FOR A REASON CURTIS CONNOR!! You don’t even get the proper spelling of your name Curty boy.
you fucking killed this my man.
Brilliant video Kurt!
Always forget about monster high
kurtis is a barb confirmed!!
every time you said pixie i heard pissy.
I had a ... tOtally r3gul@r.... childhood and I wasn't allowed to play with Bratz and the reason cited was that it would turn me into a brat
I. NEED. this. to be a series. Me and my very adult friends still to this DAY have inside jokes about the Barbie movies. We still rewatch them, unironically. Barbie movies fucking SLAP and the meme potential is ENDLESS. This has awakened a need in me and I can’t believe this will be the only video on this topic when there’s so many movies to cover in the franchise. Don’t disappoint me Kurtis. 🙏
is no one gonna mention the greeting? 🤨
but why do i remember the s m e l l of the barbie rapunzel movie?
hey yo kurtis chose my favorite barbie movie
PLEASE watch Barbie and the 12 dancing princesses
wait i thought current wasnt available in canada
Scrolltum.
first- monster high  second- bratz  third- barbie  i said what i said✌🏽🤧
kurtis should watch the bratz series, i need him to talk about the tweevils
3 minutes in and i'm a big fan of the energy you're bringing today  edit: blew orange juice out my nose at 'do i wanna gnome'
the first time you roasted Kelly had me in tears omg
saying that Kelly looks like how a stubbed toe feels is in fact the best joke in this video. No I will not be taking questions at this time.
Barbie, monster high and winx club is basically my childhood.
Not to make fun of a none existent child but Kelly looks like a big toe
I NEED Kurtis to watch the bratz live action movie, it's comedy gold because of how ridiculous it is
This video is cracking me up so hard ha ha ha looooollll lol lol lol
I remember my friends sister had a doll that you were able to feed back in 2004, so one day we snatched it and took it to the backyard where we proceeded to feed the doll lit matches and watched it burn from the inside out. GOOD TIMES🤣🥳
kurtis you gotta watch the monster high movies. in both fashion lines and important messages like racism and police brutality, monster high eats both bratz and barbie tf up
0:25 I think we all knew this day was coming
*yes kurtis* i do remember chalkzone and *yes kurtis* it does help if you say it twice
“Dylan walked so eboys could run their fingers through their hair” what an iconic line 😂😂
barbie has princess and the pauper though which is amazing
Chipper? I hardly know her.
Omg chalk zone jezus chris. That show was so good but It also scared tf out of me for some reason lol
All my homies hate Kelly
PLSSSSS U NEED TO WATCH BARBIE FAIRYTOPIA AND MERMADIA PLEASEEEE MAYORRR
Lol bald Kurtis looked low key depressed
Im so sad Kurtis didnt watch Bratz: Rock Angel’s… seriously iconic and made me who i am today 😂
You watched the wrong Barbie movie some are bops… or maybe that’s nostalgia 😂😂
“Doth thou carpets match thy drapes?” I died
im probably biased, cos of the two i grew up on barbie movies, and im in a discord server where every saturday we watch a barbie movie or 2, but i prefer barbie movies. however, both r equally bad, annoying, and sexist
“Ya hooo da ba yo” if your reading this
Repunzel was just hella kinky and that’s why she’s so relaxed while the prince climbs her hair
You literally watched my favorite movie from each franchise 😂
bald kurt was the biggest jumpscare of the century
Loved it
me, listening to Kurtis talk about what VRG stands for again: "lol, virgin"
Scrotie-scrolls
You're doing a John Oates thing right?
okay but baby bratz sleepover party is gassss tho same with barbie: mariposa 🙄💖
THAT BRATZ EP USED TO BE MY FAVORITE!!
this video is a power move
this is soo funny
As much as i love barbie, i cant get over the bratz dancing 🤣
21:41 LMAOO
Barbie swan lake and bratz starrin and stylin are the best
Petition to make Kurtis watch Barbie's vlogs
That bratz movie used to be my favorite I think I have watched it 100 times this was wild
I used to watch these all the time and I never remember them looking this bad lol
"hey why stay on topic when you can simply not" - my brain all day everyday tho
vrg means verga wym
Kurtis you shouldve watched Barbie in the Diamond Castle. Come on its pride month
Ok so unrelated but the dj at the Bratz party looks like Jack Manifold 😳😳
not getting that extra greeting ruined my day thanks kurtis
Still kinda wanna cancel you for this Kurtis
BRO THE BARBIE HORSE RIDING WII GAME IS SO GOOD. sometimes i still have to just sit in my basement playing it for a good 3 hours on a sunday afternoon to have a system reset.
when he said small soldiers it opened something in me I forgot about
Best Barbie movie is the 12 Dancing Princesses and best Bratz movie is Bratz Kidz Sleepover Adventure
i fucking love this video  the nostalgia
Kurtis please watch Barbie: Mermaidia
nooooooooo u gottttttaaa watch fashion fairy tale its amazing
Atleast watch Barbie and the Pegasus
Ever after high was pretty cool too
I've watched the Rapunzel movie so many fucking times when I was little, so getting those memories unlocked along with the commentary is fucking hilarious. Thank you Kurtis lol
Finally someone reviews these masterpieces
U literally watched the worse Barbie movie 🥲
Subscribed for the extra greeting. Unsubscribing until it’s back.
I'm not saying that Kurtis should watch the Fairytopia saga... but I'm not saying he shouldn't.
I never realized how low quality these movies were until now  i also never realized how gothel is such a #girlboss  i keep editing this comment but I'm literally mad how he didn't comparr two fairy movies, LIKE OMG BARBIE HAS SUCH GOOD MOVIES BUT HE CHOSE RAPUNZEL???? WTF BRO/lh
ya hooo da ba yo
the stache is looking nice
Omg that was one of my favorite barbie movies, makes me wanna cry!
The Barbie and Bratz movies were both my childhood and watched all of them so many times that I know them by heart. Thank you Kurtis for bringing my childhood back!
why do we feel the need to put two legends against each other...... </3
Yeah I was gonna sign up for Current but then they required all my information including my SSN so i got skeeved out lol
I am now subscribing just because of the Arctic Monkeys reference
Today’s special is the nostalgia double feature 📺
I can’t believe you didn’t say “except it’s not snow it’s blow”
kinda feeling unappreciated as a member of kurtis town without a extra greeting 😓😓😢😢😢😢
Lmao my mom didn’t want me to have either, but compromised and let me have any barbies given to me as gifts. Brats however we’re banned because she thought I’d watch the show and learn to be a brat lol.
I fucking died at scrotum scrolls
But he did do an extra greeting last week I’m confused
Bratz all the way BUT the barbie nutcracker movie was the shit!!
Growing up I bought into the Bratz vs Monster High beef and had a lot of unnecessary hatred for Bratz.
The video hasn’t even started yet and already I know this is the content I’m looking for fr  Edit: I was waiting for “chipper? I hardly know er!”
i love this specially after binging barbie movies reviews XD
kurtis really trying to get matel sued by baby alive dolls
I’ve always wanted chalk zone abilities while drawing.
I feel like kurtis thought everyone would love if bratz won, bc they’re the crowd fave, but then went and made the competition about the movies… we all know Barbie movies are superior but bratz are overall better
As a kid I always wanted a Bratz doll and monster high dolls but my mom didn’t want me to turn into a Brat or a sl*t
Not even gonna lie I loved Bratz when I was a kid. I still have 2 unopened limited edition Bratz at my mom's house because I hoped they'd be worth something some day lmao. Idk if they are or ever will be but either way.
Nice one kurtis
I subscribed and didn't even get an extra greeting 😞
My therapist: Bald Kurtis isn’t real. He can’t hurt you. Bald Kurtis:
okay so i have credit card debt and can't just switch banks.... do u wanna send me $500 for fun :^)
I watched the rapunzel movie but i did not remember the modern day parts
I AM SO ANGRY AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH GIMMME MY EXTRA GERREEEURYDIKSND
9:42 I get that, but usually, when you hold down long hair, the pressure caused by pulling it is transferred to your hand. So if you hold your hair in a fist, for example, it won't hurt your scalp. That's what I do when I comb the frizzy parts of my hair!
Should have done monster high and Winx those are the best bro
The Barbie movies go hard 😔🤚
as a brazilian who watched these movies in portuguese, i didnt know how much i needed to listen to barbie saying balls...thank you,kurtis.
I am ending my support of you forever. The extra greeting was why I was here and that's why I'm gone. 2 strikes and you're out
Nooooo! I subscribed with the PROMISE that I would get a extra greeting!!!!!! Unacceptable!
okay but barbie as rapunzel slapped
This is the video I’ve been waiting my whole life for
I haven't laughed this much at a youtube video in a long time and it's only been 10 minutes. Great vid as always dude
I really needed that extra greeting today, Kurt :'(
I love Rapunzel but it's not the movie that I would pick to represent the whole franchise of Barbie movies and as a fan... I'm sad
Kurtis if you’re gonna watch a Barbie movie you gotta watch Princess and the Pauper, it’s the best one by far, and it even has Canadian king Martin Short in it!
where’s my greeting?
Duuuude, I loved the Bratz Fashion Pixies movie!
tbh had he watched barbie's princess and the pauper there would've been more competition ya know probably.
Joke’s on you, my last name is pronounced “Folks” so I always get an extra greeting
I’m just sad you didn’t do the extra greeting…
Hedwig is a girl 😭
27 year old GANG
When my sister and I were kids, this one time we got out all of our Polly pocket stuff out and basically prayed that we’d be turned into the size of pollys
Kurtis you gotta make this a whole series on the channel
there is no competition between barbie and bratz bc they are actually dating and support and love each other
Kurtis : grab a water or a snack   Me: packs another bowl
Kurtis watching Barbie movies is my favorite thing in the world
It's like I always say: ya hooo da ba yo
Kurtis’ hair is the horniest weasel, be honest.
big synchronicity moment here because i just started a translation course last week and our first assignment was a translation of that new yorker article about mattel suing bratz. I really thought i was hallucinating for a split second when i saw the title and thumbnail of this video
barbie movies are superior. they are iconic. fight me
I thought the title was "Barbie vs. Barbz" and I thought Kurtis had something against Nicki Minaj
I'm honestly just spending the entire video praying for my extra greeting bro wtf
Seeing that title... I clicked so fucking fast
vrg es verga
apologize for not giving us the greeting
kurtis contantly raising the bar for us all
My dude why did you do barbie rapunzel , any barbie fan would tell you princess and the pauper is the best movie by far. Besides that masterpiece I would put at least three barbie movies above rapunzel - besides the soundtrack I always found it a little dull
Kurtis!!! I need a part two of you watching Barbie as Princess and the Pauper and Bratz Super Babyz please!!!
But pixies are supposed to be small… how did they not know that?
bro imagine not watching princess and the pauper for this vid 😮‍💨😤✋🏻😔
I am absolutely *l o s i n g  i t* 😂😂😂
How is no one talking about the James Charles apology vid clip. Easily the funniest thing I’ve seen all week
Now that I can’t get an extra greeting there is no point in staying subscribed
Very Really Gvirgin
bratz rock angels is tbe only valid animated doll movie
you should see bratz live action you would go nyts
To be fair, Penelope couldn't help her escape years ago because she couldn't fly that high up yet. Remember? Her dad talked about how disappointed he was in her for being kinda flightless, I think? Or maybe it was cause she couldn't breath fire?
The video we all needed
BRATZ WERE THE $HIT!
so when is kurtis streaming the bratz games?
Okay but the Bratz games for GameCube were the shit. Step aside Barbie I'm here for rollerskating fashionistas.
Why in the hell would u not choose to do an extra greeting? I am hurt wow
Look for the documentary called "I, Doll" it is soooo good. It shows Barbies changes throughout the years (obv haha) its awesome though.  And i still love you even with a perv-stache.
Please react to more Barbie movies 🤣
the rapunzel scene where it’s just footsteps made me realize i liked asmr…..
I CANT BELIEVE I DIDNT GET MY EXTRA GREETING
Bald Kurtis will haunt me
He didn’t greet us twice 😡😪 kurtis, this is going on 6 a clock news. BREAKING news. You’re getting canceled
“Doth thou carpets match thou drapes???” 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Bratz doll>barbie doll but barbie movie>bratz movie
Looking mighty dapper today Kurtis
the oscar bit really got me
I’m gonna watch this but don’t even fucking play with me kurtis I swear to god
Barbie Repunzle slaps
You kinda look like the weasel honey
Kurtis is giving weasel hard Steve Buscemi vibes in this vid.. iiiiffff Steve Buscemi was a virgin
The gnome wink proves that it wasn't pee
You reviewed two of my fav movies as a kid. This video was so nostalgic I love you 😭
very disappointed i didn't get my extra greeting! 😡🤬 i have unfollowed and reported you for your cyber crimes mr. conner. 😒
The Barbie YouTube community is going to come for you, Kurtis. I hope you’re prepared.   Also, please consider watching Princess and the Pauper. It’s a favorite  for most Barbie fans. How can you refuse???  https://youtu.be/5otYUHbaJX8
This man is high on life  L. Meth I. F. E.
kountry kurt
Barbie movie plots are immaculate idc what anyone says
thats fine and dandy but wheres my extra greeting 😡🤬
21:27 The actual best thing ever
I’m sorry but I was absolutely obsessed with ALL of the Barbie movies, The one with the Pegasus one was my favorite
Anarchy! I stan the no greeting, greeting. Stay true to you King
One time in art school it was a work day in graphic design class so we played something on the projector for background noise and I convinced them to put on Barbie Rapunzel. 10/10 artist inspiration
Unsubscribed. I need my greeting.
i always thought Monster high was better because......idk monsters-
the barbie movie characters look like sims characters
NOT THE I WAS DESPERATE LINE SKDKSK
5 year old me really thought these movies were peak cinema
Kurtis definitely not a virgin. That's my take away from the video
these 2 movies were in my childhood and you just unlocked all the hidden nostalgia
how can we tell your not lying about being a virgin if you lie about extra greetings?
When is “repunzel is bald now” coming out on Apple Music
Omg do Monster High vs Ever After High now pls
Thank you for misgendering Hedwig, Kurtis, now It's the only thing on my mind.
Remember my scene dolls? Weren't they made from barbie? I wonder if that was in competition with Bratz. I loved all of them. So weird they think one doll to rule them all.. lol.
KURTIS YOU HAD TO WATCH THE PRINCESS AND THE PAUPER SO THAT WAY YOU COULD HAVE SEEN PREMINGER
I LOVE BARBIE AND BRATZ EQUALLY, Maybe Barbie a bit more because I grew up with that
Nice mustache
This has been my favorite video yet lol
If he watched Barbie and the 12 dancing princesses, this video would have ended differently. I’m sure of it. That masterpiece can not be defeated.
gnomeo and juliet reaction??
You should have watched princess and the pauper 🙄🤚
I haven't watched yet I'm checking the comments to see if he said anything controversial
Dear Kurtis Watch more barbie movies, or I will no longer be nice to you, even if it's the law
The baby bratz movies r so much better
This video is fucking everything
When I was like 7 I watched that bratz movie all the time and one night I had a mental breakdown and thought I felt my pixie wings growing in and was sobbing my eyes in my moms room
RECALL!!! Watch one of the good Barbie movies, THEN get back to us. 🙄
I ordered your merch, a wind jacket and a T-shirt. The T-shirt never came. That was back in November 2020
i can’t believe you chose barbie as rapunzel over princess and the pauper >:/
Mattel me that 😂😂😂😂
Objectively the one of the worst barbie movies :/  not that i hate it but like.... there are better options
Dude...I’ve been waiting for you to make this type of content for so long 😭 *chef kiss* beautiful
I was a Monster High kid so witnessing this showdown was quite entertaining (please review Monster High I beg of you)
princess and the pauper outshines every bratz movie ever combined
Anyone else have garbage disposal trauma from the movie Small Soldiers?
I LOVED all of the Barbie movies! I watched them for longer than I want to admit. Lmao please review ALL the Barbie movies!
hardest I’ve laughed in months, great video kurt boy! you’re my comfort youtuber :)
All I hear is Barbie this and Bratz that. But has anyone been talking about those LOL DOLLS-
Kelly looks like if mayonnaise was a person
ly kurtis this rly be comedy gold
you look like the weasel. ily
rapunzel made the paintings in super mario 64 lol 🤣
Why even be subscribed if I don't get an extra greeting?? I was PROMISED an extra special greeting, Kurtis
the amount of absolute dilfs in this video-
I watched lots of Barbie movies as a kid, all at my friends house. I hadn’t heard of bratz. Monster high was cool too Bratz is ICONIC tho. I wish I had seen it as a kid.
Not getting that second greeting was... seriously intense!
I’m not kidding when I say that this is actually my favorite video ever
it's called a pegasus, kurtis.
Praise God 🙏
I wasn’t allowed to have bratz I think it was cuz of the name LMAO eventually my mom caved and got me one
My favorite Barbie movie is the one where they’re princesses or fairy’s something like that and somehow they come out of like flowers and my favorite brats movie is the pixy one
i wonder what kurtis would think of onion rumplestiltskin and stump goldilocks in bratz kidz fairy tales
23:36 that's just Peter Garrett as a teenager
PLEASE WATCH PRINCESS AND THE PAUPER KURITS!! Preminger is an ICON
“I didn’t mean it, I’m desperate!”  Kurtis!!!!! 😂💀💀
sebastian skittles-hair army cas barbie balls
Curtis is funny?
bruh i loved the bratz superhero baby movie with the weird ass aliens as a kid
I can’t believe you didn’t say, “except it’s now snow… it’s blow,” wooooow, Kurtis. And I thought you were a comedian 😔
No extra greeting?! #kurtisconnerisoverparty
Definitely don’t go to 11:06, it will be bad
I feel like Kurtis has Bibble energy
17:12 ah. Prehistoric tiktok
how can you watch barbie life in the dreamhouse and not devote your life to worshipping raquelle?
bratz fashion pixies used to be my favorite movie i watched it all the time
I LOVED CHALKZONE. HOLY SHIT. That just unleashed a whole bunch of childhood memories. Damn
Doth thou carpets match thou drapes ?
the absolute slander of kelly in this video is unbelievable! 😡😡#justiceforkelly
unsubbed, whats the point if i dont get greeted twice. It's as if i never subbed... i cant believe this. the first time you forgot i was distraught, and now u jest about it. man, dont do this to your fans. Hope it doesn't get to strike 3...
#kurtisisnotincontrolparty
I seriously peed in my fucking pants watching this. Made my god damned day! Thank you Kurtis 😄
Well, ackshually, Kurtis, Barbie was created by Ruth Handler, who adapted her from the German "Bild Lilli" doll. Mattel licensed Barbie for distribution.  Barbie might have taken a dip in quality over the years, but it's still the *only* fashion doll line that's doing different body types, skin tones, faces, etc. Bratz could never.
Not kurtis misgendering hedwig
Barbie as Rapunzel is my favorite Barbie movie lmao
English speakers seeing the VRG: virgin Me, a spanish speaker: VERGA
Not sure if Kurtis will ever see this but I’m glad he is taking control of his intro. I know it’s mainly a joke but I know that sometimes creators feel guilty and I think it’s okay if you don’t say the same thing every video.
so disappointed the bratz movie you watched wasn't the live action one lmao
okay but now we need to know kurtis’ opinion on the monster high movies
Bratz had waaaaaay more culture.
The amount of nostalgia I am receiving from seeing the Barbie rapunzel movie. I forgot this existed and it’s all coming back to me 😭
Kurtis needs to watch Barbie swan lake, it is a cinematic masterpiece 😩🙏
yo let’s start a kelly hate club
I was having the shittiest day ever but this video made me want to twerk angrily.  thanks kurtis
Princess & the Pauper would have been a better choice for a *good* barbie movie, tbh
NOOO KURTIS you should have used THE Bratz movieeee the one they’re famous for
ok to be fair you compared the best (and arguably the only good) bratz movie to one of the older and more boring barbie movies
Don't victim blame, Kurtis. She has been abused her whole life by a narcissistic bitch. That's hard to overcome.
Kurtis should’ve watched Fairytopia smh
im all for defending bratz as my favorite doll but…pitting the movies against each other!!? how could you kurtis
Wooo! Double feature! More merch? Love it. Algorithm interactions!
thanks again major kurtis for the laughs 👌
Okay but what about monster high??
Bratz will always be superior. But you should watch Barbie Dream house! Some episodes are so funny!
bratz > barbie, if you think i’m wrong then fight me
Honestly disappointed that you picked Barbie Rapunzel and not princess and the pauper or maripoza but you did pick the 2nd best bratz movie so I’ll let you off with a warning this time...
I used to watch the Bratz pixie movie every night until I fell asleep, I eventually trained myself to get tired just from watching it
6:20 was when I died laughing   😔🤚
That Bratz movie was my favorite growing up and seeing it again now makes me realize how strange it was
Truly I am still mad to this day that I can't figure out the last level of Barbie Horse Adventures on my PS2 and I'm 21 years old
ya hooo da ba yo
4:57 Kurtis: “kelly is a goddamn nightmare to look at” Me: *is literally named after barbie’s sister, kelly* o h-
Perfect timing!  You make my day better!
EXTRA GREETING
PART TWO WITH BARBIE SWAN LAKE AND BRATZ ROCK ANGELS
Nope. Barbie absolutely wins, idk what ur talking about
Shave plsss it makes you look like a 38 year old dad
OK Barbie has better movies but Bratz is better at everything else
That Arctic Monkeys gnome joke almost ended me
I’m a lil bit upset that bibble made no appearance
My parents were those parents that didn’t like bratz bc of the way they looked. I wasn’t allowed to have bratz. Only barbies. Lmao.
KURTIS. I wasn’t ready for “Mattel me that.” I choked
Barbie swan lake is the superior Barbie movie, as well as Barbie fairytopia. BUT, as a whole, Bratz will always be the superior franchise.
The barbies and the Bratz are dating actually
damn bro I’m kinda annoyed that you’re like white knighting every episode standing up for people’s rights is cool and all but like calm down
Barbie is so superior the soundtracks from movies like Princess and the Pauper SLAPS they had no reason to go so hard but they did anyway
Bratz win
Bratz win
havent even finished the video yet but i fucking love barbie movies i swear theyre so addicting for no reason
2:52 no way, i went to that community college
Okay the bratz movie plot was too confusing
I never laughed so hard kkkkkk best kurtis video
If I were changed back from a tree, "it wouldn't be well done my daughter." My first words would be, "I need a shower."
i love this man platonically, he's too VRG for me
kurtis you’ve done it again
well a virgin would refuse to do an extra greeting just saying...😔🖐️
“🎶 Rapunzel is bald now🎶” is a punk song I desperately need
There's a few differences between Barbie and the Bratz. First, unlike them, she has a PERSONALITY! Barbie is kind, determinate, try every possible jobs ever and has friends. Chloe and her pals just likes shopping; that's it! It makes them a bit boring :S Also, their big lips aren't sexy or cute and their feet are too small; their heads are so big and weird, i don't like them! Barbie movies have good morals in them; follow your dream, be honest and brave, never give up on your goals, don't banadon your friends etc. What's the moral in the Bratz movies? NEVER abandon your passion for fashion, how original U-U The only interresting things the Bratz did was meeting fairy tales characters in their baby film AND meeting a Genie. Beside that, nothing was that exciting!   In short, i prefer Barbie. She teaches girl a ton of fun stuff. Bratz ALWAYS focused about fashion and nothing else. That's lame! There's way more hobbies than shopping, the world doesn't function because of that. Not all the girls likes shopping and make-up. I never used it cause i prefer natural beauty :) I find shopping ok, do it on occasion like for my Birthday or during summer. I don't find it as amazing as the Bratz did.
How dare you base your opinion of Barbie on Barbie as Rapunzel and not Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper. How. Dare. You.
Dylan the bratz eboy, was the original tiktoker confirmed
On a roll with the puns
You watched the worst Barbie movie 😣
But the real question is Does thou Carpet match thou drapes ?!
🧚‍♀️ 🧚‍♂️ ✨RAPUNZEL IS BALD NOW✨🧚‍♂️🧚‍♀️
hello???? where is the my scene doll representation????
petition to ask kurtis to watch the barbie diaries
i'm glad that you commented on a barbie movie and now i want more. Barbie, The Magic Pegasus was one of the best, in my opinion, because of the detail to plot and good side characters. Barbie as Rapunzel .... not as much
why does Kurtis look kinda good when he's bald or is that just me
Its ok kurtis, that pun was comedy gnome, HA get it........................I hate my life. LOL
I SPEAK IRISH SO THE GNOME SCENE MADE PERFECT SENSE TO ME AND I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE
I played the Bratz video game on the ps2 or something and it was the best game ever created
ya hooo da ba yo
18:59 AHHHHH HAHAHAHHAJAKKKNDNEKKXNW
Bratz FTW
the scottish gnome was terrifying ngl
Actually the tongue goes numb kurtis , gawd .
Barbie is better no question
Very Really Good VIRGIN
barbie rapunzal was a huge part of my childhood😔✋🏻
Kurtis, admit bratz music slaps!
this unlocked a core memory
I’m very sad you didn’t watch Barbie princess and the pauper or the diamond castle 😔😔😔 they’re so fucking good but also crazy and I think they’d make a good video
18:59 SCREAAMINGGG
should've watched barbie and the diamond castle...
Rapunzel would become baldilocks
Not including the majesty that was the MyScene and Polly Pocket movies in this is a travesty.
my favourite barbie movie is either barbie as the island princess or the magic of pegasus ngl, i need to rewatch them tho
barbie films > bratz films
Ya hoo da ba yo Also What was the song that was parodied with Rapunzel is bald now Its been bothering me for a bit
Thank you a heavily debated topic, glad to hear your input!
barbie will always have a special place in my heart but bratz is literally unbeatable
How dare you not watch Princess and the Pauper, it has the greatest villain song in Barbie movie history
New favorite Kurtis vid
Kurtis is hilarious- his sense of humor matched with his editing skills are A1. Keep producing great content!
Unsubbing cause no extra greet 😤
Kurtis I am begging you to watch Barbie Princess and The Pauper- it is the best Barbie movie and the villain is so fun, you'll love it
18:37 i was in tears by the end of this bit
Kurtis please don't tell me you forgot the extra greeting intro how could you I trusted you JK keep rocking king
21:57  you’re welcome;))
Barbie Pet Rescue was my first experience in PC gaming lol I loved caring for the different animals, oh and then finally catching the monkey on the play set!
I CANT STOP LAUGHING  AT KURTIS ANGRILY TWERKING😭😏
Bro that Bratz movie triggered a memory in me, I suddenly remembered the movie vividly
Your mustache looks like you’ve been given a Dirty Sanchez…….that’s for skipping my extra greeting. I didn’t want to say that but I wants my extra greeting. Also great content.
the fact that you have my favorites from each in your thumbnail
Damn Kurtis really letting your Bratz bias show...if you ever do a round two pick The Princess and the Pauper for your next Barbie movie, it's better.
Was I the only one who sang along  “Rapunzal is bald now” the second time? 😂
Bratz are totally the best for me, as a Hispanic girl it made me really happy to receive a doll with my skin color, plus their clothes are way cooler than Barbie’s “traditional feminine” only pink look and Bratz gave true gay representation! Bratz are the first doll company to have wlw characters :))
The fairy bratz is my absolute favorite thank you king 💅
It’s not Barbie vs Bratz, Kurt boy. They’re lesbian gfs
of course owls get horny. thats what evolution is.
I respect your decision to not do the extra greeting, I will say that bit is what got me to subscribe 😂 I would watch all your videos and felt left out bc I wasn’t subscribed yet so eventually I did it and I’ve been here ever since
Ey yo watch Barbie princess and the pauper
No extra greeting? Unsubbed.
monster high dolls were superior cause of their articulated joints and their movies were really good imo! :,DD
Kurtis may I suggest the masterpiece Barbie and the 12 dancing princesses
Not sure about pooping, but there was actually a doll that peed and you had to change its diaper. Even as a kid watching those commercials just made me wtf. But if I could find one now, Kurtis, I'd send it to you <3  P.S. Everyone's facial hair choices are their own, but.... dude. Dude.  edit: HEDWIG IS A GIRL OWL
"flying unicorns" are alicorns btw <3
I should really stop eating while watching your videos. Huge choking hazard.
The hole on the plot of Barbie Raponzel is insane. The king's dougther vanishs and he just put the blame on the other king, starting a war, not even looking for her. Whyy??
i haven't watched the video yet, but i saw the title and went on a total spiral looking for pictures of all the bratz and my scenes (and the two barbies) that i used to have. that was the happiest i've been in like 6 months, omg, thanks
Yeah, but like. What about myscene dolls? Those movies SLAPPED
What the heck Kurtis, I come here strictly to get an extra greeting!
Barbie Nutcracker best movie.
should've watched the princess and the pauper. og barbie fans will understand
WHERE IS MY EXTRA GREETING 😑
I love the fever dream vibes these videos give me. it's perfect.
Oh hell yes this will be good lol
take back that 4/10
Bruh I literally got a barbie dream house ad in this video, Cody ko vs tiktok's got a competitor I see..
Bratz video game on PlayStation was the best. For that reason Bratz wins this round lol
There is actually a Barbie that shits lmao. Barbie Skipper’s Babysitter Inc
watching this at 4am and i definitely was not prepared for the gnome jokes...
Honestly, the Barbie Vlogs are pretty good.
🎶Rapunzel is bald now 🎶
ya hooo da ba yo
ya hooo da ba yo
When Kurtis put on that red wig he looked like Smrtdeath. I hope even one person gets this
When I was younger I really liked the Barbie movies and the Bratz movies I watched a lot of them
You failed me
hedwig doesn't ask for oral she asks for owl
Kurty your personal look is taking me back to the early 80s and I just don't know how to feel
12.5 million views on that apology……..impressive!
i misread it as barbie vs barbz
The angry twerking killed me
I hope we get an extra greeting next time
The only reason I subbed was for that extra greeting
kurtis u good???
nah most barbie movies suck but diamond castle slaps
pitting strong women against each other, smh
I heavily appreciate both, but monster high gang ✊
Only virgins skip their intros ngl
Does thy carpet match thy drapes? 😂😂😂... Kills me everytime
i can’t believe you left out the best scene when the gaurds get flamed by the dragon and then they run back to the village and you can see their underwear
Offended + upset that bratz rock angels was NOT picked
The PS2 and GameCube Bratz games’ cutscenes live in my head to this day. Also every single PC Barbie game since like 95 was so elite yet always contained something weirdly horrifying (shout out to Detective Barbie in the Mystery of the Carnival Caper)
Did kurtis just refer to the literal American Psychological Association saying the dolls sexualized children as "a lot of parents criticizing Bratz dolls"??
no extra greeting unsubscribed
i have the VRG hoodie and someone thought it said vag on the back.
I noticed YouTube unsubscribe from you lol I had to subscribe again
My parents weren’t those parents that said I couldn’t have Bratz Bc they were slutty or whatever but whenever I would play with my dolls my Bratz would be the village whores and ABSOLUTE HOME-WRECKERS
You GOTTA watch Barbie swan lake, 12 dancing princesses, and fairytopia!!!🤪
and you didn’t watch barbie princess and the pauper WHY?
i would sell my left lung for another rating bratz movies omg
no you're the jerk
Hedwig is a female tho #kurtisconnerisoverparty
"This was their one time to not make Kelly look like what stubbing your toe feels like." Perfect
Got it VRG means you’re a Virgo !
Go white boy go
ya hooo da ba yo :)
why is the gnome irish?
The barbie spy game for gba was my Obsession as a kid I loved that shit I wish I could play it again
my name is kelli
Dude this was hilarious
Mga got their revenge with the lol dolls.
Now he just has to cover the MyScene movie, then he'll have really covered all doll companies from our childhood
I literally could not stop laughing!!!! this video was great:)
You look the guy who would tell kids they have barbies and bratz movies in your van
fashion pixies made me so delusional as a kid I really thought I was a pixie
true
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse is actually so elite. My first graders and I can vouch.
*SigHORNY Weasel*
wished he watched princess and the popper :// he would’ve loved the villian lol
“I’m not a virgin” *watches Barbie and Bratz movies*
You should check out monster high next
Bratz 4ever
I remember every inch of Barbie rapunzel
wtf was that bratz movie
OMG THE PIXIES ONES BEEN MY FAVORITE FOR YEARS
🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲 imma need my mf extra greeting.
Barbies movies are the weirdest thing of 2000
Revolution just released a bratz themed makeup Collab and I must say I bought the whole thing so I guess there is a comeback
"So no Headwig" was one of those jokes that made me laugh so hard that it was completely silent.
I highly recommend to watch Dylan’s crash (17:06) at the slowest playback speed
ya hooo da ba yo
Very Realy Gvirgin
Hello Kurtis
I'd like to say at the top of this video, goodbye extra greeting. You were a good friend, but it is time for you to go. At first it was great, you were always there at the beginning of every video for myself and all others members of Kurtistown, but lately things have gotten weird since you were gone that one time. You seemed different, off, and you put off vibes that really, you didn't want to be there. Lately especially, things have just seemed like we are going through the motions, you are there, and I gently put a smile on my face but deep down I know you and I both don't want to keep doing this. I found you a new apartment, since you didn't seem to want to get your own place, and I hope if we ever cross paths again it's in a soft new light.  Alright back to the video.
As someone who grew up with both barbie and bratz....... these movies were interesting
ngl, I missed the extra greeting...
monster high next 🔫
Im disliking this video
i wish he did it on princess and the pauper instead
I demand a reaction for all Barbie movies from the 2000s
I unsubscribed cuz I didn't get a extra greeting
kurtis looks like the uncle of kurtistown, unc kurt
4:39 HELL YEAH MY FAV MOVIE
Barbie and the Nutcracker slaps
Hey Kurtis, I was having a bad day and I came to watch your video to calm down and I don't even get an extra greeting. As a member of Kurtis town I feel personally betrayed. If it was an accident I could forgive it but it was deliberate. Good day sir  Edit: the video was very good it made me feel better please don't banish me externally
ur mommy
look kurtis, this is a cool video and all, but if anyone ever said bratz movies are better than barbie movies they’re just incorrect
I subscribed for the greeting, where is it!?!?!?!
you guys tuned into the VIRGIN podcast lately?
Kurtis’s hair needs to be fixed
if it makes anyone feel better barbie killed kelly in 2010 and then replaced her with chelsea
kurtis this is one of your funniest videos ever
I love both these movies
Please watch more Bratz movies, they were my childhood and watching them now they are just so fucking funny
give him to me ngh~
This intro is a violation of our contract
"Could a virgin have a podcast?" Me, who just started a podcast a week ago: ... Mayhaps...
Bratz Fashion Pixies and Bratz Kidz Sleepover are THE BEST Bratz movies
kelly giving me silent hill 2 vibes😍
I come in here like "lol Bratz are so much cooler than Barbie" and then I remember I watched probably every single Barbie movie ever made
Please watch all the movies
Real baddies watched the Polly pocket movies
Why is nobody talking about the obciously superior franchise: Monster High. Or Winx, that also was basically my whole childhood.
Gnome vs. gothel  Who you got ur bets on?
idc its Bratz Doll till I die
21:27
VRG=Vegeta Rides Giraffes
I’m wish to had a bratz dolls obsession when I was younger rather than a Barbie obsession
the skin color thing is not an argument for bratz, there were barbies of color at that time as well, my little sister had one, and that was in germany so Im pretty sure those must have been available in the US as well
Monster High movie next please 😌
It would be really funny if u reacted to the vampire diaries x
ery eally ood
The dragon really looks like knock off  Spyro lol
The audacity Kurtis has to compare Barbie as Rapunzel and Bratz Fashion Pixiez when the real comparison was OBVIOUSLY Barbie: Fairytopia
princess and the pauper do go hard tho
kurtis is losing his fucking mind in this video
im very disappointed kurtis didnt watch the baby bratz movies😩
kelly slander is not only appreciated, but encourage
Tbh that barbie chase scene always made me feel like they were being super sneaky as a kid
My mom never bought me barbies because they never looked like me and she wanted me to think that I'm beautiful even though I'm not white. Honestly, I thank her for that... and I thank you Kurtis for acknowledging it. Great video BTW (don't think I mentioned that)
I would like to argue that Monster High was the best
While watching this video I have eaten an avocado, a breadstick, a price of cake and two glasses of water😌💥
this is the video i didn’t know i needed
#cancelkurtisconnor
12:22 KAHUNA IS THAT YOU?!
12 dancing princesses and the 3 musketeers were the best barbie movies this is the hill i’ll die on.
now do one of max steel plss
I don’t care how plotless Barbie movies can be, the nostalgia is what is golden 🤌
her hair is so long, the pain doesnt travel all the way through
The apology bit being on a fucking James Charles video I’m sobbing
Seeing Bratz Fashion Pixies in the thumbnail triggered my fight or flight response
please do a myscene movie!! they were top tier
This made me so happy. Thank you.
You see a virgin wouldn't do an extra greeting
So...no extra greeting?
I was promised an extra greeting kurtis
16:40 Why did that dude put so much emphasis on "trans". I was ready to declare the bratz dolls movie the clear winner for it's impressive progressiveness (even if it is pretty weird to introduce someone as "a trans") then he ruined it for me.
Bratz is like the cool goth kid in class who defends you from bullies while Barbie is like the kid who acts nice but calls everyone slurs
theres only footsteps in that chase scene because its a horror movie
Kurtis grrr 🤬🤬🤬 I WANT MY EXTRA GREETING GRRRR 🤬🤬🤬🤬
to be fair you probably chose the worst barbie movie there is. mermaid tale, fashion fairytale, fairy secret, and princess charm school are cinematic masterpieces
this is so good, please make another video of you comparing two other Barbie and brats movies, the Barbie animals are so funny
kurtis, rapunzel secretly being bald is a plot twist from shrek 3
bestie you shouldve watched princess and the pauper!! :(
You Little Pathetic thing don’t give me a EXTRA GREETING TWITTER ATACK( This is a joke btw)
I already know this video is about to be my new comfort video, this is my childhood 😭😭💖
Dude it’s simple. Barbie is basic as hell. Bratz are baddies af
Yo KURTIS WOT ?! ……he posted THATS crazy .
Barbie 4 Life
Lol this video was top tier🤣🤣🤣 I’m not joking when I say I laughed for a good 10 minutes about the angry twerking. 😩🤣🤣
I thought the letters in the back were short for “Virgo”  and thought he was just really proud about that
tf happened to my extra greeting?🤨🤨🤬🤬
the kelly slander is the highlight of this movie
KURTIS YOU SHOULDNT BE ALLOWED TO BE THIS FUNNY
Can't believe you chose my Community college flag to showcase an asshole for shame!
ok tbh the barbie movies are so much better than the bratz ones,, you just watched a shitty one
Barbie princess and the pauper is the best movie to ever exist ✋
PLEASE SOMEONE MAKE A COMPILATION OF KURT DANCING I NEED IT
kurtis i am begging you to watch more bratz movies, every single one is a gem
I thought this was a dream at first, one of my favorite youtubers talking about one of my favorite things
Ok to be fair the only Bratz movie I’ve ever seen is the superhero babies vs potato aliens and ngl that movie went hard but my loyalty will always lie with the Barbie movies (not the new ones tho ✋✋)
BARBZ WHERE YOU AT
“i cannot handle this weasel”
I had completely forgotten chalk zone existed! Thank you for unlocking that memory!!
25:32 iF he wasn't a virgin then he would have daughters. Hes trying to hoodwink us!
waits patiently for the monster high and ever after high video
The best Barbie movie was princess and the pauper and no one can tell me otherwise
you picked the best movies from both franchises omg .... like srsly I loved both of these as kids
finally someone who agrees that the bratz movies are superior!
My extra greating
One of the best jokes at 6:10. You are welcome
I swear that Barbie move feels like a fever dream but I watched it at least a hundred times
"Let's get back to it"
yahoo yabado
No extra greeting? You can't trust anyone these days 🙄
Only virgins skip the extra greeting
"Bratz or barbie?"   me: monster high but only the older version bc it sucks now
*_"just a firefighter slapping a hose on a gnome's hole"_* r/brandnewsentence
holy fuck it’s the moaning weasel movie
Imagine claiming you aren't a virgin just seconds before not giving us our extra greeting 😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤
i subscribed for the extra greeting in the begining of every single one of his videos, i won't give you another chance man, u already got two strikes, dont let me get to number three or i will, and quote me on this guys, i will actually unsubscribe.
Lol I remember watching the Bratz Fashion Pixies movie really young, and being creeped out by it...and then I watched it again at like 8 or 9 and loved it. Hello Edgy awakening.
im hurted that he picked bratz... #notmymayor
Nah bro the Barbie movies are all about the ✨aesthetic✨
there’s a third layer of dolls that were called “my scene” dolls, and they were the SHIT
Bruh that gnome used the Gaeilge word for girls 👀 they got the lore in there and everything
This video gave me such intense flashbacks to my childhood… thank you for making this LOL
If her hair was really strong and she tied a knot in it, or ... had another way to dissipate the direct force on her scalp, it wouldn't hurt that much. Source, have long hair and stage combat experience and getting hair pulled looks way worse than it feels
This is definitely my favorite fucking video Kurtis has made.  I have never clicked on anything faster
Ummm where’s my extra greeting kurtis? Pretty sure this is my channel sooooo G e t. T o. I t. N e r d
My dirty little secret is that I owned TONS of Barbie books and movies, not a single doll, owned a couple Bratz Dollz, and* video games. Honestly, both franchises had great messages to girls. Jade was my fav <3
I watch the Spanish (latino) dub of every barbie movie and barbie slaps.
why is barbie repunzel animated like its sims 3
ok but both barbie movies and bratz where my CHILDHOOD. i most defiently liked bratz most but ive watched so many barbie movies and they are bangers
i loved barbie rapunzel so much
Oh my god I watched Bratz fashion pixies daily as a kid and smth about this just set my nostalgia on fire oh my god???
Is your retention poor cause fuck was this video far more chaotic than usual, TIK TOK GIVE OUR ATTENTION SPANS BACK,
I thought the girl had turned into tinkerbell for the Disney movie beginnings
my only complaint: Hedwig is a female owl
dude i was completely all over bratz as a kid, i would’ve recommended you bratz babies or the one about the diamond gogo boots, dude there was game! okay lemme stop freaking about dolls but yeah.
Why isn’t anyone commenting on the James Charles reference 💀 💀
WHY, and I'll only say this once, did you choose Bratz Fashion Pixies and NOT Bratz Rock Angels??????? Amateur.
Kurtis is going to get cancelled again for no extra greeting ‼️
There's another barbie movie with fairies with a kinda similar plot to this Bratz movie
What the fuck do you mean 4/10 Barbie movies are a masterpiece
THIS ISN'T FAIR CURTIS you should have chosen movies from the same time periodd
A virgin is exactly the kind of person who would purposefully not give someone an extra greeting
Honestly offended my name is Kelly and I played with Kelly Dolls on the reg
bratz wins, haven’t seen the video yet but yea
Dylan's backpack got _naturally_ stolen by a *crow*
Luckily I was on the bus when I got this notification, cuz in the privacy of my home I would've shat myself
Kurt boy should make a series of reacting to Bratz movies
There’s a lot of things about this video that makes me mad, like that he didn’t give us the second greeting…. But more so… it was Curtis bald, during the hair skit.
Welcome back to my channel, if you're new here, what's up? How's it going? And if you're coming back, what's up? How's it going? ✨ It's very good to see you again, I hope you're doing well. ✨
No extra greeting. No benefit.  Unsubed.
Barbie Swan Lake was fave movie as a toddler (still have the VHS) but my favourite doll was Sasha from Bratz - so, I appreciate this considerate mashup sir
Alright Kurt, this video in particular was funny. I cried, I’ll give u that.
this is really good
I say this with love, but this video is so chaotic. There was not a single moment where I knew what you were gonna say next. Love that for you
Kelly IS terrifying THANK YOU
DOTH THOU CURTAINS MATCH THY DRAPES
I had to take several breathers during this one. Really funny stuff
My mom didn’t let us have Bratz because she didnt want her daughters to aspire to be a “brat” lol. We got to have MyScene dolls though which were like halfway between Bratz and Barbies, they also had killer movies ngl
i’m suprised the entire comment section isnt livid about no extra greeting
Dylan is what cody and noel would be like if they were one person, looks included.  Unrelated, Kurtis should have watched Bratz rock angels /:
kurtis slandering kelly is the funniest thing ever
i hope im not the only one who *loved* Bratz as a kid because of how cool they looked but could not stand to watch the show or the movies because even then the animation was so confusingly weird
honestly if rapunzel held her hair away from her scalp and used her hands as the weight-bearer then her head wouldnt get hurt and her arms would get toned
I know in my spirit you were gonna watch Bratz Fashion Pixies that was the only one I owned.
ya hoo daba yoooo
lmao kutis is me but with the word "coming"
Bratz freaked me out because they lacked feet when you took their shoes off.
this just reminded me of a movie I watched RELIGIOUSLY when I was younger that isn't related to this, Trollz: Best Friends for Life - The Movie
hello kurt
My mother had the skipper and scooter dolls because barbie was too...shapely. so even barbie dolls were attacked for their appearance
you need to react to a monster high movie! you will hate it🥰
not kurtis judging the barbie vs bratz cinematic universes with movies nowhere near close to the best.........i demand a redo with barbie's princess and the pauper vs bratz rock angels (btw i am personally a barbie's swan lake stan myself but princess and the pauper is the fan favorite so i'll let it slide this One time)
god. my third comment on the video.  i was JUST talking about chalk zone on tiktok the other day.
i watched this as a kid and it's actually wild to see a video about it. oh god
ya hooo da ba yo
Kurtis is so stupid. I'm crying too much 😭😭😭😭
the fact that i had both these movies on DVD as a kid I'm overjoyed with you watching both :D
The myscenes were superior also we're their movies
I had both dolls as a kid but always preferred Bratz cuz they had that 90s aesthetic. We can talk about how young girls don't need dolls with crop tops or tats, but I did prefer them
Did you use the Greendale Community College logo from Community for the butthole? XD
shoutout to the fact that my mom refused to buy me bratz dolls so the only two I had were gifts
MGA Entertainment actually tried to sue Mattel first, saying that ‘My Scene Barbies’ copied Bratz. The  reason Mattel counter-sued MGA Entertainment is because the creator worked for them when he developed the idea for Bratz.
15:19 me laughing at the terrible joke my sugar daddy said so I can get money
I like Barbie better, I played with Bratz too when I was older and more into fashion because when it comes to fashion choices Bratz are better, they come with way more outfits and accessories but Barbie has just done so much. She's been pretty much every job you can think of and that's inspiring for little girls also Bratz have no feet lol
i NEED kurtis to react to a monsters high movie, ik that is a 2010 thing but please PLEASE, someday, anyday idc
we all know kurtis is a little biased because bratz are an early 2000s staple. millennial king !!!!
Not to be all srs or anything but I'm not doing well mentally lately, but goddamn can Kurtis videos make me laugh like nothing else. Can he make me laugh? He sure Kurtis Can-ner okay cool appreciate that you're welcome
Older Barbie movies will always b superior imo 💯
I just came to say where’s the Monster high Kurtis
You imitating the Bratz dance 😂😂😂
Why does kurtis look like off brand Pedro pascal
Ya hoo da ba yo📣
this video is hilarious
Bratz give the unrealistic body standard of having to switch entire feet when you want a different shoe
I was literally talking to someone about Chalk Zone the other day!! But they had no idea what I was talking about!! Thank you Kurtis! I knew I wasn't crazy! Plus that show was bomb af!!
absolute baller of a mustache king
Im here for the kelly slander
Bro i watched like all of the barbie movies and im sad that i remember this shit. Also my favorite was Barbie and the diamond castle.   Ahem- I FEEL CONNECTED
Kurtis, as it is the law that I have to be nice to you…. I have not disliked the video. HOWEVER!! Wanna know what I DID dislike?? The blatant Kelly slander. Between that AND not giving me my extra greeting… honestly my feelings are hurt. I set aside MY TIME to watch YOUR VIDEOS during FINALS WEEK, and this is how you repay me? This? That’s all? #dissapointed #kurtisconnerisoverparty #istillwantmyextragreeting #thisissatiresopleasedontbullyme
Small soldiers scared me so bad as a kid
i can't stand for all the barbie doll slander in these comments... bratz had some amazing, diverse lines (and video games!) and i love and respect both brands, but i feel like a lot of people are forgetting about some of the really elegant and/or fun lines barbie had like modern circle, life in the dreamhouse, etc. they each have their strengths :)
the bratz fashion pixies movie was my absolute favorite movie when i was younger so thank god kurtis approved it
The dvd special features on Barbie Rapunzel were incredible
Bro I’m 21 and still rewatch some of the slightly older Barbie movies (mostly just the ones from before they change the voice actress) and I still thoroughly enjoy them
for some reason i have so much nostalgia from barbie movies
I wasn’t allowed to play with Bratz bc my mom thought they were too sexual and now I’m not a Hot Gurl 😔
dang, rude of them to cast spyro and not even give him credit 😔
07:00 you missed a perfect opportunity to say “scrolltums”
This video saved me😔💜
kurtis im begging you, watch the bratz super babyz movie those little potato fuckers are 100 times scarier than baby bunting
Gothels brow game is *chefs kiss*
ball scrolls
I love how each video recently is getting more and more chaotic
Childhood hit me HARD here.. I used to have a Penelope dragon doll... If I remember correctly it was partly robotic and moved and sang.   I also loved my Bratz dolls. My dad refused to buy me any male versions of the dolls so I had to resort in making one of my Bratz dolls the boy or just made them all lesbian.
How could you possibly pick the repugnant Bratz over the sophisticated Barbie? Barbie is mature and intelligent, whereas the Bratz are brutish tweens
Actually the Teen Barbie movie was the best. You know the one with the turquoise drums and pink guitar 😂
THANK YOU FOR THIS KURTIS ILY
can't believe the MyScene erasure in this video
I'd suggest watching Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse or one of the funnier old Barbie movies, but there's nothing to make jokes about when the subject material is perfect.  The self-aware humor that has developed over the course of the franchise is really something else.  Also I'm against arbitrary comparison of young (fictional) girls, but the original Monster High was the fukken shit, except for some not-great racial weirdness.  The teen (monster) girls' casual willingness to murder friend and foe alike was a bold move in the fashion doll franchise.
Un-FUCKING-believable that Kurtis didn’t even watch The Princess and the Pauper. Or Secret Castle, Island Princess, Princess Charm School, 12 Dancing Princesses. They’re all goddamn bangers and could crush any Bratz movie any day. I’ll die on this hill.
❎ extra greeting ✅ extra reminder that kurtis is nOt a viRgIn (plus an extra reminder that being a virgin is okay)
❎ extra greeting ✅ extra reminder that kurtis is nOt a viRgIn (plus an extra reminder that being a virgin is okay)
7:56 NOOOOO HE LOOK LIKE THE MAIN DUDE FROM GOAT STORY
No extra greeting 🙄✋ CANCELED! /j
no extra greeting? what's the point of staying subscribed
Comment
No extra greeting? Unsubscribing.
Bratz were the original baddies
Kurtis you should watch Barbie and the Twelve dancing princesses. ICONIC. the best barbie movie.
Barbie as Rapanzel was my childhood, so glad you picked that Barbie movie!! 🥰
YOO THAT WAS MY FAVE BARBIE MOVIE. I still love it 😗😗😗😗
'ever think about that? How does she fart?' silly Kurtis, you know girls don't fart 😁
kurtis u chose the worst barbie movie kurtis barbie and the diamond castle is right there kurtis
Everytime I think about bratz I think about this one lipgloss they had that was made out of candy and you could eat it and I ate mine immediately after asking my mom to buy it from me and I swear there is no footprint of it on the internet
Thank you for not doing the second greeting!!! Honestly it has played itself out and i always skipped it.
i don’t think i’ve laughed this hard at a video in a while
I used to have a several barbies and I had a brown Bratz doll, the one with the mini skirt that play tenis, pretty cool if you ask me, but yeah, they all had really weird bodies. Specially the ones that were made in the 60s, my aunt gave me a barbie from that time and it had a super small waist. So, my take is that barbie is inspired in the beauty standard of the time that is happening and not viceversa. We are influenced by icons and barbie is just an exagerated representation of that so yeah, the problem is not the barbie but us, we are like so gullible and put down the throats of our children this crazy beauty standars.
Bro please get a buzz cut 😁
Kurtis, you and the editing are both so unhinged in this one and I'm living
so let me get this straight, the v, r and g in the background stands for virgin? yeah, i think that's correct! thank you kurtis for finally clearing this up :)
"Why stay on topic if you can simply not." Is my new motto.
was i the only one obsessed with Barbie and the Twelve Dancing Princesses? i watched that so. much.
Give him to me    MMmmMmMmMmhhh
I.....I never thought in all my 3 years of watching Kurtis that I would ever disagree bc like barbie had a plot what even was that brat movie
I grew up on both Barbie and Bratz but always liked Bratz dolls and movies better👁👄👁👍 I remember having the Bratz laptop with the little mini games too like bruv it was so good
WHAT ABOUT BOTH
monster high is by far the best doll movie franchise. they literally tackled topics like racial segregation and police brutality in a way my 7 yo pea brain could understand. 11/10 would recommend all of them.
It's not a proper barbie review until u watch barbie a fairy secret. It's a cinematic masterpiece.  Or watch barbie princess charm school, my personal favorite. 😀👍
You changed ):
OH Y GOD MUSTACHE
The tittle... I think I'll come back in a few minutes, so I can prepare myself for it.
I freakin loved bratz!!
And that was when kurtis lost all his subscribers
kurtis: we be watching rapunzuel  me: ok ok a classic but not the most well known barbie movie kurtis: we be watching fashion pixies me: a what now
i mean both franchises set up unrealistic standards of beauty BODY WISE so theyre equal in my eyes
I laughed way harder at this than I should have
thanks for spoiling the movie kurtis! :-(((
barbies. bratz. trivago.
nice jokes
LMAO the way his hands went all the way around her waist 🤦🏻‍♀️
waiting for the Monster High video now love you kurtis
Ok Barbie and Bratz are cool... But I lived for monster high.
monster high. bratz just wins. also the dolls were just so unique and more fun to style
gothel is low key creepy tho
so r we overthrowing mayor kurtis or
How do you get any action with that mustache
3:25 you forgot the shit sound
Kurtis I can't believe you didn't talk about how god awful the pegasuses from Bratz Pixiez looked
anyone else remember myscene dolls? i remember them having a movie aswell
Please shave your mustache
HATE the fact kurtis never says the main bratz names!! "breona's friends" THEYRE NAMES ARE CHLOE JADE SASHA AND YASMINE
Henry Cavill lookalike 😮😮😮
"F o l k s" *EXTREME CLAP*
No one:  Kurtis seeing a gnome: “do I wanna gnome”
My mum hated Bratz because of their ‘attitude’ compared to Barbie haha. I remember on the soccer outfit Bratz box had a saying like “it doesn’t matter whether you win or lose, only how good you look doing it” and that settled me never having one
kurtis could've chosen ANY other barbie movie yet he chose my least favourite 😳 The best barbie movies (in my opinion) are:  Barbie and the 12 dancing princesses Barbie: the princess and the pauper Barbie and the diamond castle  Barbie - A fashion fairytale Barbie in a mermaid tail Barbie: A fairy secret Barbie: Princess charm school Barbie: The princess and the popstar Barbie: Mariposa and the fairy princess  (those are the only ones i remember) Is this a way of my saying that I'm afab and born in the early 2000's? yes.
ya hooo da ba yo!
"ya hooo da ba yo"
ive never laughed harder at a video than this. i almost peed
no extra greeting?  I SAY  LET’S STAGE A COUP
BARBIE AS RAPUNZEL IS ONE OF THE BEST ONES
i like not having the extra greeting im so impatient it honestly just annoyed me and i would skip it half the time
That title card at 4:19 just reminded me that Epic Death Battle exists.   I gotta go check them out again after this.
please do a video about barbie mermadia specifically Bibble and how he is a war criminal
Kurtis should honestly watch so many more barbie movies.
Only Kurtis could be such a real OG to do a review like this. Damn.
ive watched all the old barbie movies sadly stopped when recent ones started coming out
No competition? What about Jem and The Holograms??
Stefan ran away like an oblivion npc
In conclusion Monster High is superior :))
Guys…Barbie Princess Charm School though…
Why did you do Arctic Monkeys like that

**angry twerking**
Okay but have you seen Barbie as Princess and the Pauper? Didn’t think so Kurtis. That movie alone is SIGNIFICANTLY better than every other Barbie and Bratz movies... but tbh I wouldn’t mind a video of him just reviewing every Barbie or Bratz movie lmao
Genuinely one of ur funniest videos yet man
Kurtis lowkey making me okay with dad humor one pun at a time...
Argh, I think I dated that weasel in my past.  😒
I couldn’t stop laughing for most of this video, I just love this so freaking much
bro u watched the lamest barbie movie shouldve watched fairytopia and the bratz pixie movie duh more to compare
My mom was one of those people that never let me have Bratz but I could have monster high dolls so- 💀
Growing, I think Polly pocket was more of a contender with Barbie for me than Bratz
Ya hooo da ba yo
I remember as a kid playing a Barbie video game and then you know (keep in mind I'm a dude Not that it matters) It was a spy game but for some reason it was really fun even though it was a lowres pixelated game But for some stupid reason it was so much fun
Vrg is for vergón in spanish 😎
“I’m iN cOnTrOl HEre” Okay daddy 🤤
I’m so glad this video exists. My three favourite things in one video.
He’s so funny (kinda but like in a way your little brother is funny and really fucking annoying to the point where it’s entertaining) but why he gotta be so uglyyyyy I don’t wanna look at that the whole video
when both pieces of my childood collab together
Okay, no fucking lie, when I was a kid I actually had a friend/neighbour who's toddler brother would scream "I'LL PEE ON YOU" at the top of his lungs whenever he saw my older brother. That gnome clip just sent me back 20 years.
Shhh no it's barbie she wins
i came while watching this
I think it's a bit funny how those moms were so indulged in their own worlds that they forgot a lot of poc and some white girls just had naturally big lips? like they forgot that thin lips are just as normal as people with big lips
Idk if this counts, but it said successful on my account.. but I just added ur name at my Current Code tab. 🥴👉👈💕 Hope that does the trick.  ALSO , MAY I ADD, BARBIE FUCKIN NUTCRACKER SLAPS
9:32 there was a Bratz movie where instead of Rapunzel just kinda chilling there, there was a hook that Rapunzel could wrap her hair around and hang the hair from there so the strain wasn't solely on her scalp
Honestly, that Bratz movie was great. Maybe it's nostalgia but I loved it!
Okay, these two movies are whatevs, but Bratz definitely wins in the soundtrack department. Seriously, who the fuck composed the ost in that movie and why did they make it slap so hard? 😂🤣
Bratz was put on this earth to agitate all the conservative parents of the world.  Bratz over Barbie anyday. Am one of those kids who made those UK sales go up heh
That's it, no extra greeting, unsubbed. Extra greeting was the entire reason I watched these videos. I wanted to be extra welcome. Now I'm extra sad.
ok the bratz movies kinda dope but the barbie movies are literal cinematic masterpieces..no contest.
Woodchipper? I hardly know her!
Kurtis I want you to watch Bratz Rock Angelz or the Genie one... PICK A BETTER MOVIE
The more I look at that horrendous mustache, the more I hate it - and I just realized why:  You remind me of this guy who fingered me when I was 17, he was also a comedian, although in his case that title is a big stretch. I remember being shocked at how small his document was - I had it hard in my hand and I could barely see it, I wasnt used to seeing something so small  He left a bad feeling in me - first because I thought I was ignoring him but after a week I went on snap and he had blocked me (that tots broke my 17yo heart), and secondly, when I turned 22 (his age when we were together) and I felt so grossed out by the thought of it all...  Anyways this has nothing to do with the video hope no one reads this mess of a therapy worthy word vomit 💫
That weasel belongs in a goat story   Also the weasel is a mink I believe
Kurtis should have watched Bratz fairy tales
The doll that Barbie was based off of was a German sex doll
It’s cailinis for me! Imagine getting the one foreign word in the film wrong😂
I thought some of these Barbie movies were a fever dream I had when I was little.
BRATZ FASHION PIXIEZ?!!?!?! You have unleashed a memory within me I never knew I had
My mum HATED Bratz dolls when they came out and thought it would hypersexualise me. Jokes on you mum, I'm a man now. They clearly don't do shit haha
the next boxing match:  bratz doll vs. barbie doll
I would be a part of this argument as somebody who obsessively watched Barbie as a kid, however I was never allowed to watch Bratz so I have no clue what Barbie is up against  In case you were wondering, my parents never let me watch Bratz because they thought I would turn into a brat
I might have to unsub, I came here for my extra greeting and got nothing.
I'm glad none of us are accepting the Barbie Movie slander
kurt please look up a lovely clip called "dylan from bratz stands in poison ivy
ya hooo da ba yo
The bratz ps2 games (rock angles and forever diamonds) are why gen z has the most gamer girls AND THATS A CERTIFIED FACT
i dont know how i feel about this no extra greeting, I might cry any moment bring it back RIGHT NOW luv u kurt boy u stinky little boy
This is such a wonderful topic for a video like I love both barbie and bratz they're both just so iconic
I think those glases just make you high on lsd
I like Barbie better
Kuris knowing his target audience lol
Holy shit I just realized I saw the barbie rapunzel movie before
can someone understand that gnome?
Oh no you did NOT
Give him to me ughhhhh 😩
WHAT WAS THAT SNEEZE LMAO
Pls pls pls monster high movies
don't pit two bad bitches against each other!
bestie always posting bangerz
I had a talking dragon from the repunzel Barbie movie and I loved her until it would talk when the talking dog plushie I had would talk and it scared me
bratz rule barbies are garbage worth nothing
barbie from 1959 - 1972 was superior and simply unmatched. then unfortunately they went a little downhill..
“Regular proportions” lol actually her measurements are not physically possible im p sure
This video is more unhinged than usual and I love it
my mom did not let me play with barbies for a while because she wanted me to see myself and know that i can be just as beautiful, fashionable, and cool, even if society repeatedly tries to tell me im not. bratz remains superior!
Nobody let Trixie Mattel see this
Kurtis has the same aesthetic as the weasel tbh
Why am I even subscribed anymore? You always say "that's what happens when you subscribe, you get an extra greeting" and now what... no extra greeting. Subscription pointless
Hey, thanks for leaving me with the visual of Barbie Rapunzel with "long ass hair" dude...
noah fence but i’m scared if that squirrel
Is that Drew’s Kim Possible wig?
anybody else remember that one bomb ass game of the movie?
Also gothel is voiced by angelica houston. Wild
I remember watching Barbie movies with my cousins and playing with the dolls. It was so much fun! But watching the Bratz series made me feel represented and beautiful. Finally a doll that looked like me and was awesome! So when my mom bought me the dolls I had the best of times... until I lost their feet and head :(  Anyway, I'm loving the fact that the Bratz dolls are coming back and can't wait to get one.
pega ele, frita ele, faz purê
It's not virgin guys 🙄 it obviously stands for viagra
I meannnn Barbie Nutcracker?? Barbie Swan Lake??? I LIVED for it.
ya hooo da ba yo
Community anus flag logo... thank u, king
yo wtf? where my extra greeting at?
ya hooo da ba yo
as a kid who grew up on Barbie movies and played with Bratz I will say I am pretty heartbroken you didn't watch and review Princess and the Pauper, since it's undeniably the strongest of the Barbie films (it's an original musical! I am a girl like you goes HARD)
Bratz didn't have as many movies because the team dedicated production to a TV series instead, immediately better than Barbie 🤣
this is seriously one of the funniest videos ive watched in a super long time. ive been in a super dark place and this made me laugh so hard. it was exactly what i needed to lift my spirits. thank you so much mayor kurtis for all that you do for these videos. i know you go through hell just to make them and make random people laugh for 30 minutes but it means a lot more to me then you will ever know! thank you for everything you do! ❤️ - faithful citizen of kurtistown.
So this is where Disney got their inspiration for Rapunzel
your reaction to just let go is so genuine i love it
I loved the barbies movies sooo much as a kid
plz watch barbie's princess and the pauper
I sound ridiculous for how hard I’m laughing at this video. literally this entire video is so fucking funny
“Matell me about it” was an elite joke and I snorted lmfao
i am dissapointed
i saw the title of this video and genuinely thought it said "barbz vs bratz" & i was like yasss kurtis conner is a nicki fan confirmed 😍😍
Not gonna lie, Lena and Cymbeline were my Gay Awakenings from my childhood, THEY WERE SO ATTRACTIVE
Ok let’s all admit Barbie movies SLAPPED
Omg kurtis you didnt have to 🥰
this is what i've been waiting for
#canceled
in the inevitable rematch Curtis should use the super baby Bratz movie that i dont know the name of but am sure exists
Kurtis this video was hilarious, keep up the good work
I thought vrg was for Virgo. Idek if he’s a Virgo
Very really good? So a virgin
Ya know, I will always think that Barbies are better simply because my mother was one of those people who wouldn’t let me play with/watch Bratz.
Too political. Unsubscribed.
I like assurtive kurt
Not me being salty he chose to review one of the worst barbie movies
Now you have to review MyScene moviesss
Should have watched the Barbie princess and the pauper movie, it's objectively better than the rapunzel one
I fucking loved the Barbie as repunzal movie omfg I forgot about it I had it on dvd
Take a break if you need one however long we luv u
like for Nicki
kurtis is over party
shout out to my mom for being a Cool Mom™ and getting me so many bratz dolls as a kid.   and shout out to kid me for making my bratz and barbies girlfriends... it all makes sense now👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩
Bratz was more diverse back in the 2000’s but I don’t think the same thing could be said now. Now Barbie has that whole you can be anything line , with poc as docters, ballerinas, Olympic medalists , fashion designers, etc.  I was in big w the other day and they had Barbie in a wheelchair too. Tbh, I don’t think they’re suddenly saints , they’re doing it because they realized people would stop buying their toys if they weren’t inclusive. However little kids don’t need to know that lol. Also I’m sorry Barbie rapunzel is good but y’all SLEEPING on Diamond castle and Mermadia .Tell me kurtis would have ranked bratz as higher after watching bibble.
In regard to hair climbing you just need to wrap a portion around a support and that will take the stress off of you and put it on that. If her hair is like so long it goes down a tower then it would be easy to have a slack of hair that would separate the stress of the pulling from affecting you.
nice podcast plug bro
Y’all remember those baby alive dolls the ones you’d feed and then they’d shit
not the video I expected this week but as a doll fan and collector im super happy :DD
Are you ok Kurtis
Should have watched Barbie Princess and the Pauper
I knew Kurtis had the letters in the background but for some reason I never made the connection to his podcast I kinda just thought he chose three random letters to hang up for funsies lmao
In my 27th year of life I had always hoped that a man with a moustache and mullet would review/compare the Brats to Barbie… ahahah.. send help
Why did you bring back these memories?!?! My sister watched the SHIT out of barbie Rapunzel!! I'm suing you!!!
Another thing to mention, why do the adult characters from the Bratz movie look ENTIRELY DIFFERENT than the teenagers? Where’s the consistency?   Overall the animators did not care for anyone else except the main characters.
Rapunzel was like my favorite movie, I was obsessed. I have to give them credit bc I really would only think about their movies. I imagine it was for me what these YouTube kid's channels are now for children. It's crack
Only bad bitches stan both
Thank you Kurtis. Seriously, I have too many greetings from all the extras and I don’t meet that many people to use them all. Finally I can catch up on demand. Phew 😮‍💨 thanks Mayor
i hated 10:15
Was not expecting an Arctic Monkeys joke
kurtis, the extra greeting can be way shorter, like the whole if you're new here hello if you're coming back hello is really long and i can understand why you're sick of saying it, but you could just say, if you're coming back its really good to see you again. FOLKS
WE WANT EXTRA GREETING YOUR GETTING CANCELLED AGAIN BOI
the bratz fairy movie goes SOOOO HARD
i can't believe kurtis watched a barbie movie during pride month and he didn't choose diamond castle
HE'S FINALLY DONE IT!
bratz dolls>barbie dolls barbie movies>bratz movies
Kurtis looks like a young Weird Al in this video.
THAT BARBIE MOVIE. THAT MOVIE WAS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE.I would watch in the car, at my house EVERYWHERE
Kurtis thinking abt how these two random movies are super alike and then just listing components of the Hero Cycle 💀💀💀
"DOTTH TH6 CARPET MATCH THINE DRAPES!?!?" BFJDKEBEHSODKROI
What am I even subscribed for then :(
you do the bratz fairy movie but not the barbie fairy movie? FOR SHAME, KURTIS. we deserve equal comparisons.
kurtis chose one of the worst barbie movies😔 12 dancing princesses is the best one.
Kurtis it's very virgin of you to not talk about Myscene Dolls
Leave Kelly alone she's cute 😭💖 especially when u out here looking like a SHOWER DRAIN 😚
I love both!
You should do a video on "the fairy princess and the unicorn" 😭
wait no do the bratz fairy tale one its got an extended gnome dance scene that will haunt u!!!! (also theres a rapunzel part where she tries to escape like 100x what barbie pulled)
woah, double upload? thanks, drew!
The Bratz game I had for GameCube was everything. But the Barbie Rapunzel PC game was my og favorite game. The theme song slapped🤣
I'll ride for bratz til I die but the princess and the pauper movie go hard asf and I watch it to this day
kurtis if you really want the barbie experience, you need to watch barbie princess charm school, ITS SO GOOD.
the 'do i wanna gnome' bit absolutely killed me, i can't fucking breath
barbie mermaidia 2 would've pulled through
I better not see nobody shittin on Barbie in the Nutcracker OR Barbie as Rapunzel, that shit was formative for my love of dance and art.
Yeah! Set those boundaries! Parasocial? More like ALPHAsocial, amirite? You greet who you WANT my dude.
funny
bro bratz kinda sucks🥱
Barbie<<<<<<bratz>>>monster high dolls
AHHH This video is so funny omfg 😭😭😭😭 I’m on the floor
Okay that weasel reminds me of Hisoka from the anime Hunter x Hunter
I could talk about the beef between mattel’s Barbie and mga’s bratz for like 30 minutes !
can his videos get any better? everytime i get a notif from him i get so excited HE NEVER DISAPPOINTS, this man needs more love!!
bless you kurtis
Barbie saying “Balls” with reverb has no RIGHT to be this hilarious.
Kurtis you NEED to review the live action Bratz movie, it's absolutely gold
R A P U N Z E L   I S   ✨ B A L D  N O W ✨
Barbie and the nutcracker vs Bratz rock angelz pls
the Barbie Rapunzel movie goes HARD
It just doesn't feel right without it..
Big vrg energy
"ya hooo da ba yo"
You're moving closer and closer to 80s Weird Al, keep going
Why do people keep watching Barbie as Rapunzel for Barbie reviews? It's by far the weakest Barbie film, watch Diamond Castle, or Princess and the Pauper, of 12 Dancing Princesses, or even the goddamn Island Princess. Not Rapunzel, it's shit.
wtf man why not the extra intro you give me ptsd
Extra greeting rn.
the animation in the barbie movie looks like a sims 2 machinima
KURTIS YOU MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO WATCH PRINCESS AND THE PAUPER!!!
Before the video even starts, Fashion Pixiez was the shit when I was the little girl. I vote for that one!
Bratz was soooooo superior... i mean it wasn’t even close. The bratz music, clothes, looks, and lessons still hold up to this day. PERIOD
8:57
Next time, I want a Bratz Rock Angelz review 😎
Kurtis.... I said, I would die the day that you didn’t do an extra greeting😍‼️😭
is kurtis without an extra greeting even kurtis?? :(
oh no, i had a hard week and i needed that extra greeting 🥺
He disrespected Arctic Monkeys AND purposely skipped the extra greeting. Wow Kurtis I’m disappointed
all day i was thinking about how i miss kurtis and how he hasn’t posted but then he suddenly posts🤨 coincidence i think not
this is too funny!!
Could a virgin have a mullet or moustache like that? I think not.
u better sag the extra greeting
"not a virgin"  ... idk that sounds like something a virgin would say
I loved this! Thank you! Couldn’t stop laughing 😂
the only bratz movie i ever watched was like a halloween scary one or smth and it scared the shit outta me (i was like 8 i think)
I feel empty inside after that intro
kirtis
“Oh my god it’s fucking kelly! Nevermind” just about killed me
MATTEL ME THAT oh my god
I would have liked this video better if kurtis didn’t have his mustache- i’m uncomfortable listening to a cowboy judge barbie movies 🤨
i'm so sorry for all of you who are not brazilian and don't get to appreciate the movies' amazing voice acting in portuguese
I prefer the barbie dolls and movies but both are very good 😌
Very disappointed that this is not a video about small soldiers. Tbh.
Having three sisters, I remember watching a lot of these Barbie movies growing up and unironically liking them. Of course I would have never admitted that back then.
When u watched both of these movies religiously at a kid 🥴
I grew up watching pirated bratz movies I will not take criticism on them
tf where’s my extra greeting?🤨🙄 unsubscribing…
KURTIS I neeeeeedddd you to do an episode where you learn how to twerk. (Kind of like the magician episode) you were talking about if you could twerk like Meg on your podcast do it pleassseeee
ya hooo da ba yo
Calling the *Bratz* "Brianna's friends" throughout the whole movie is such a power move
7:24 IM DEAD😭✋
*Not that there's anything wrong with that* Sneinfled
what reverb plugin are you using on the "balls" ?
Did Kurtis use the greendale flag from community for the asshole
bratz fashion pixies was the fuel of my entire weird little girl group at recess for years. there was always a fight about who got to be lyna.
18:58 i have mad respect for u man i literally died
The Monday joke, it killed me. ☠️ Y'all can attend my funeral next week.
i clicked the like button at 18:48
Only a virgin would make a podcast called Ver Really good. It’s what they wished was told to them.
DISLIKED 👎 IF THE EXTRA GREETINGS STOP, WHAT DO I GET AS A CITIZEN OF CURTIS TOWN???
Kurtis choosing bratz over barbie is a small brain move
Lol hey
Bring back the old intro that was just the Kurtis Conner song
Unsubscribed. If not the extra greeting then what?
That “Do I wanna gnome” segment kilt me
He should watch bratz super babies🤣🤣🤣
Please make this a series, I have every single Bratz and barbie movie on DVD I can give you a loan
Fav part had to be the j*mes ch*rles WOMP WOMP WOMP cameo
I wasn’t allowed to have Bratz dolls since my parents thought they were legitimate evil from the Devil so yeah parents were hysterical about Bratz
Slap on some shades with some speed, He would look like a baby version of Dr. Disrespect lol
I saw my grandma, like, once or twice a year when I was younger and buying me Barbie films is the only thing I ever remember her doing.
barbie swan lake and barbie the princess and the pauper are so much better than barbie rapunzel
I feel bad for the people named Kelly.
but extra greeting made me happy :(
New goal: Be the Bratz doll in every Barbie dream house 💅🏼
the way i ran to this video
Remember every moment of both these movies!! Funny how he referred to the four core Bratz girls as "Brianna's friends"
WATCH MONSTER HIGHHHHHHH
Both of these movies are creepy as hell.
Bratz were the goat doll but barbie movies were the goat doll movies
wait when does the video start I never heard a second greeting so I kinda tuned out because I thought the video hadnt started yet
I’m not a Barbie girl until you bring out the  Rapunzel movie. They left us no choice but to Stan
"i'm not a virgin" mmhm, awfully suspicious
okay the hair and style the Bratz had deserves a round of applause
Kurtis I subscribed for that extra greeting🥺💔
Why am I even subscribed if I'm not getting an Extra Greeting Unsubscribed.
Wait, Jacob is in this video?
THEE most important debate to this day
ok but i most definitely think that Colin O'Donoghue (Hook from Once Upon a Time) should/would be in the horniest weasel category
It's so funny when the balls clip plays because there's like 4 solid seconds that you can hear it echoing
finally, a topic i care about
this a kelly hate page and i love it
he 100% should’ve watched princess and the pauper that movie is SO good
ya hooo da ba yo
"I'm not a virgin-", says the guy who continues to comment about Barbie and Bratz 😂
God the NOSTALGIA THANK YOU
Mayor kurtis watch princess and the pauper next preminger is king 😻🔥🥵👑
I remember the barbie movie but not the fucking moaning. LMFAO  Barbie movies were iconic
KURTIS!DO THE GREETING!!! MY ANXIETY IS KILLING ME! DOOOO  THE GREETING!!! :O
okay but also the weasel is so beyond iconic
The problem with this video is that kurtis chose the wrong Barbie movie. The obvious and correct choice would’ve been Barbie: the princess and the pauper
Thinking about the fact that he made a joke about rapunzel becoming bald when someone climbed her hair when that literally happened in shrek..
Anyways stan monster high dolls
you didn't even pick good movies of either... i wished you consulted with us barbie and bratz fans :( since bratz won, check out bratz passion 4 fashion or bratz rock angelz... that's all I'm saying
My grandma walked in on me watching this on the TV. Let's just say she was not impressed when she saw a man angrily tweaking on the screen. Edit: LMFAO, I MEANT TWERKING
As a kid, I loved both Barbie and Bratz. I think Barbie was my favourite because of the sheer number of movies they made (and I loved them all lol), but damn, they made a Bratz PlayStation 2 game and it was my favourite game for a long time--I can remember more of that than any of the Barbie movies. Bratz made me love video games even more ✨✨
try the princess and the pauper.... and bratz rock angelz. both 10/10 movies. love both dolls
Isn’t the “butthole” the logo on the Greendale Flag from community?
Man I’m just saying you missed out on watching Barbie as The Princess and the Pauper 💯💯
i was more into monster high <3
Feeling Personally attacked for not having that extra greeting. What’s the whole point of being a citizen of Kurtistown
You put The lady from holes…. But you didn’t put Nemo up
ya hooo da ba yo
barbie won bc of the 12 dancing princesses😁 best movie ever
I’m going to say it, this is Kurtis’ best video literally ever. It’s so absolutely unhinged I just…..blessed video.
Now I wanna watch all 3 matrix movies like that
kurtis please you need to do more barbie movies give them a chance to redeem themselves,,, or make fun of the newer ones cuz theyre HILARIOUS
Idc what anyone says, barbie was my childhood and will forever remain ICONIC
This is the funniest commentary video
4:38 why did I think he was going to say Barney smh 🤦‍♀️
Dude "barbie as rapunzel" was literally my show I had the DVD so I would watch it on long car trips and my family went on a lot of car trips. Some of you might say " BuT yOuR a GuY aNd BaRbIe Is A gIrL sHoW." well to that, I say               F u c k  Y o u
kurtis.... you watched the wrong barbie movie.... 12 DANCING PRINCESSES
I did cry when I didn’t get my extra greeting but I will get over it 🥲
Fuck the extra greeting, you’re a badass, Kurt.
kurtis should do monster high vs ever after high next!
i love this video, honestly i wish it was longer. only criticism is that the barbie movie that kurtis used is one of the older movies, it's unfair imo. i would've loved for him to watch princess charm school, or to go with the pixie theme he could've watched barbie fairy secret. this is the stupidest criticism ever i loved this video, very fun, hilarious, good job.
you saying do i want to gnome was my main motivation for liking this video
I was raised by a single father and he would always make my horse figurines fart when we were playing and I would get so mad.
Barbie princess and the pauper is better 👀 ya hoo da ba yo
if we don't get an extra greeting could we at least get an extra hug or smth? im depressed dude
18:21 has the be the funniest thing I've seen in a while, I couldn't stop laughing! Thank you for your content Kurtis.
Stop you’re ruining my childhood....oh lord this barbie movie looks horrible tho
this is the best video u have ever made
I posit that this is the creepiest yet most enticing thumbnail of all time
Not sure if anyone remembers that TV series the 10th Kingdom. In one scene the main character has super long hair, and when the guy climbs up to rescue her, she is legit screeching in pain. One of the best renditions ever, the actress did a phenomenal job.
"Scrotum Scrolls"   I almost laughed so hard I choked.
Um no, you don’t have that, you have a podcast called virgin and it states that way any love you 😘
#nosubscriptionwithoutextragreetings
I want Kurtis to have freedom. It's creepy when viewers think they can just control the content creators they watch. Extra greeting or not Kurtis is still pog. Moustache or not Kurtis is still cool. Let content creators you love have freedom to create and be themselves. They aren't in existence to cater to viewers.
Kurtis needs to watch the bratz movie where the dog orders Chinese food, I think it’s called sleepover adventure or something
Hi kurtis
But but but ... THE EXTRA GREETING?!?!?
Honestly, Rapunzel painting the tower to trap gothel is pretty badass and clever
Can u pls watch all of the Barbie movies and rank them I need ur input
bratz >>> barbie
Barbie's Princess and the Pauper or Barbie Swan Lake were wayyyyyy better than Barbie as Rapunzel, just sayin
the absolute silence after "Do I wanna gnome?" is giving Bo Burnham a run for his money
May we have a second part mayor ? 🙇
I haven't watched but I'm warning you : BARBIE MOVIES > all of universal matter.
i dont get it,in my eyes dylan has the exact forehead size as kelly xD
Honestly. How fucking dare you.
Why did the barbie movie look like it was made in the Sims 3
*BRATZ HAD THE BETTER DOLL, BARBIE HAD THE BEST MOVIES* 💅🏻✨
You literally compared the best Barbie movie to the worst Bratz movie lol 😂💀
if you’re gonna watch a barbie movie you gotta watch the best one which is barbie and the magic of pegasus, sorry i don’t make the rules
Tarantino would definitely have won horniest weasel out of that lineup smh
just marry jenna already
that chasing scene reminds me of those videos of like high school musical where people take out the music and just edit the realistic sounds in.
I literally gasped when I saw the tittle lmao
i really like the energy in this video. maybe its the skipping the extra greeting. its a great video kurtis.
I knew the disappointment hit him as soon as he started singing I'm CRYING 18:44
barbie my beloved.
I was so excited for Bratz because I wanted to play with my (all white)  classmates and finally have a doll that looks like me. Uhm, kids are mean and they just bullied me in different racist ways so mission failed 😂 But what’s kind of funny is that the Bratz look is the ideal now, yet only on white women who bought it. They went from loving Paris Hilton to Kim Kardashian. Look like an ‘ethnic’ woman because that sells but don’t you dare actually be ‘one of them’ 👀 maybe I’m dead inside but seeing this evolution over time makes me cackle
Another banger, Kurtis.
That cough in the ADR'd chase scene has slain me.
Not Kurtis calling the 4 main bratz gals 'Briannas friends'...
Very Really Good: Not A Virgin, in theaters near you
why are the gnomes jamaican??
Shave or gae
okay fine ill comment
*mustache fart*
virgin :)
Kelly looks like Bella Porche
Barbie movies was my childhood, they're so entertaining, my favorite were barbie in the 12 dancing princess, barbie and the diamond castle
Why I’m not comfortable watching this without the extra greeting 😩
Kurtis you should’ve watched Barbie and the 12 Dancing Princesses. Or Barbie Fairytopia. OR BARBIE AS PRINCESS AND THE PAUPER And the BRATZ Cinderella movie is so much better than whatever you reacted to. How can you expect to like these movies if you don’t choose good movies? Get better taste in Barbie and BRATZ movies.
How the fuck can the animation be that bad
Kelly (derogatory)
omg he needs to watch like a Monster High movie and then an Ever After High webasode. that was my legit childhood
BIG FOREHEAD REPRESENTATION IS IMPORTANT
Just me or is Kurtis rapidly turning into John Oates from Hall & Oates?
A movie from each doll company? Shame on you, Kurtis.  I'll expect a Monster High video in the future.
24:48 those are "flying unicorns", they are Pegasus.
How dare you not watch Barbie as The Princess and the Pauper. Also the MyScene movies were p good
Alternate title: Kurtis roasts movies from my childhood
seeing the cover for the barbie movie knocked the wind out of me
Today, Kurtis is the personal hero of the girls and the gays
Tell me your childhood was dope without telling me it was dope:
bald kurtis looks like kevin from shameless
Everyone knew that one friend in 1st grade who had every Barbie movie, 100 dolls, the best snacks, their own mall in their backyard, and a helicopter who you didn’t really like but always played with them because they had the coolest stuff
Bless you!!!!
Hey Kurtis, never do bald Kurtis again. Thanks!
This video is exquisite 🕺
This is hands down the best video ever made
CHAAAAALLKKKK ZOOOOONNNEEEE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
14:54 this is the most Calgarian shit I’ve seen all year. And I live in downtown Calgary. 🐴
hmm... main reason I subscribed in the first place was for the extra greeting...
The echoing balls got me every time 😭, I hope this will be a recurring thing in your videos if you ever talk about balls again ahaha
Virgin Really Good
we have the same chair
no one: kurtis editing this every 5 seconds: 𝑏𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑠 👹😈😼
Not that I don’t love the ide of this video but Kurt fuck with my extra greeting and I had to unsubscribe😢 there’s nothing special about kuristown anymore
I wish Kurti boi said ball scrawl
Kurtis you are a dishonest person. You promised me an extra greeting at the beginning of EVERY VIDEO. I want what I am entitled to which is no more than what you have promised to provide.
In the Disney movie called tangled she uses a wheel thing I forget what it's called but it takes the pressure off her head if you're hair was just hanging over a ledge however it would hurt
The Barbie movies at least follow a more cohesive plot but I'm going to have to give the award to Brat solely because of Dylan
Attack of the magic goths
i will agree with the terror of the barbie triplets though,,, why do they have them in every movie,,,,
i think this video is too controversial
the bratz dad in pixie mode reminds me of ginger lord farquaad
The missing extra greeting was a godly intervention trying to prevent us from delving deeper into more drama
Can someone please tell me what that yatta song is ?
Unsubscribing, I came for the extra greeting. Boooooo Kurtis
Kurtis I’m so sorry but you have to make another of these. EVERYONE KNOWS that the best Barbie movie is Princess & the Pauper !!!!!!!
thank u for the video kurty
how are you gonna watch barbie rapunzel and not talk about the dress tranformation scene PLEASE KURTIS UR KILLING ME
I vividly remember watching the Bratz movie but like a live action... they looked like people to me. and I was like twelve so I should've known better
Kelly got that JacksFilms forehead
SHE LOOKS LIKE WHAT STUBBING YOUR TOE FEELS LIKE 😂😂😂😂😂
CANCEL KURTIS HE DIDNT GREET US BACK
Ha………… scrolltums
she didn't do the spell until then because rapunzel can't make her tea and clean the castle if she's locked in her tower forever cmon kurtis follow the plot
fuck it the pixie king is a dilf i ain't gonna lie
Should have reviewed princess and the pauper 😭
Could you put a flashing lights warning? I’m not trying to be that person, but especially during the evil pixies race thing, there were a ton of flashing lights. /srs
The only bratz movie I'll endorse is the fairytale one. All the other barbie movies are far better.
I remember when I was younger I watched the Bratz baby's movie with the alien people and I had nightmares for a while about it
Ya hoo da ba yo whatever the hell that means
2:54 Kurtis thought he could sneak in Greendale’s flag without us realizing
U should have picked the best of each to test this smh,, I think they are tied
As someone who was a huge bratz dolls fan and also a huge barbie movie fan im actually scared to watch this video
Not the two best comparisons, I'd have gone Barbie's Princess and the Pauper, but hey. It doesn't really matter :)
I thought you died for a sec
pegasus vs. princess and pauper next pls
11:56  BALLS
this had a rlly fucking good intro
Idk if it's just me, but Kurtis' emotions seem sus in this video. Hope you're doing alright, mate.
I finally realized it stands for Very Really Good. I was like "vegetables rats garden?" and a bunch of other dumb combinations. I actually figured it out right before he said it
Does Bratz have Tchaikovsky soundtracks? No? Ok, video over :)
"first on the scene" *My Scene dolls have entered the chat*
what the F A W K is the stach 😂😂 no hate btw lol just new
i cant believe he didnt mention how fuckin LONG the bratz dance scene is its like two minutes of those one second shots of pixies dancing lmaooo
You should cover Bratz: Passion 4 Fashion - Diamondz! It’s got a real Desert/Cowboy theme to it you might in joy! 👋🏽🤠✨
I got really bad vibes from that bratz movie as a kid. Especially that angry twerk just scared me.
I was having a bad day and kurtis not giving me an extra greeting was the cherry on top of the disappointment sundae that is my life
Guys i think the letters in the back stands for ViRGin
Does anyone else realise that Kurtis, Drew and Danny upload at almost the exact same times???? Don’t get me wrong.. i get extremely excited when I see one of them uploads, because I know I’ll be getting to watch a new video from each of my favourite youtubers in the same hour 😍😍😍
Why is Kelly a character from The Sims
The true test is The Princess and the Pauper (the best Barbie movie) vs. Starrin’ & Stylin’ (the best Bratz movie).
He should have done a reaction to Princess and The Pauper. I’d love to see what he thinks of Preminger lol
i am not a jerk so i will comment. this is the comment
Manifesting that Trixie Mattel reacts to this
Sihorny Weavel
Didn’t even see the vid yet but i know that some important shit is going to be said 🙏🏼🙏🏼
Ya hooo da ba yo
1. Monster High. Extremely good diversity & I like the Monster way. 2. Bratz. I liked the Baby Bratz movie. It was stupid and I used to love it. 3. Barbie. She's good at everything she does and doesn't learn anything. I know it's a kids show, but their has to be a limit. Idk, I just don't personally like the Mary Sue trope.
i watched this movie on repeat as a child. you don't know what love is Gothel!
The Barbie's dream house series is easily the best of the Barbie-verse. My kids watch it and it's actually hilarious.
No but I watched both growing up
HAHAHA! This video made my dad, love ya, Kurtis
Bruh 18:43 was the fucking breaking point
screaming at the meme reference in "speaking of Barbies" @01:26 . I forgot about that video
BRUH YOU SHOULD HAVE WATCHED BARBIE MUSKETEERS
Bratz were way cooler cause the clothes were cooler and more stylish. Barbie clothes were kind of boring and princessy so only toddlers liked them
Is that Cree Summer voicing the dragon?
I remember that bratz movie with much better quality than it did lmao
What about monster high and My Scene?
this cannot be forgiven. I WAS PROMISED AN EXTRA GREETING KURTY BOY. IM UNSUBSCRIBING THIS IS ATROCIOUS.
I could've sworen bratz movies look better holy fuck, i know the brabie quality got better but holy-
"Would a virgin have a podcast?" I'm pretty sure being a virgin is a requisite to having a podcast
Kurt's is one of the only guys with a mullet I trust
Omg me and my sibling had those Bratz with the masks and the pixie dust magic wands things
bratz movies are cool and all but barbie fairytopia: mermaidia is the pinnacle of cinema i said what i said
I've never seen a mustache touching the upper lip. I'm disturbed.
I can’t help but wonder… how many dogs must’ve pissed on that tree-mom
BARBIE PRINCESS AND THE PAUPER IS A FUCKIN MASTERPIECE
Rapunzel is literally the definition of Learned Helplessness
kurtis i very much appreciated the arctic monkeys reference. thank you for it.
Why are you putting these two QUEENS against each other? Shame on you for making them fight
Me watching this while wearing the colourpop x Malibu Barbie makeup 👁👄👁
been having one of the worst weeks of my life and this just made me laugh so hard. thanks for always being a source of joy kurtis
Rapunzel is balls now
Fuck that chalk kids so was so so so far in the back of my brain man
I just got a notification.
Ok but honestly I watched the Barbie movies like hundreds of times I remember every line and weird sound affect a character makes lol
TEAM BARBIE FOREVER
I will still play Barbie horse adventures to this day. Sorry not sorry.
I watched barbie as repunzal approximately 25 times a day when I was younger lol
ya hooo da ba yo
Ok but let's be honest, if he had watched Barbie Princess and the Pauper this would have ended differently
Even though Horny Weasel won the Oscar category for horniest weasel, as a fan of Tarantino movies, I think we all know Quentin Tarantino would be a close second
ya hooo da ba yo
Ok but you have to watch Barbie and the 12 dancing princesses bc that movie slaps so hard omg
Excuse you sir but I'm gonna need a video on myscene & monster high
SKDJGHSKDJGH SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS AS SOMEONE WHO STILL WATCHES BARBIE MOVIES IN ADULTHOOD
21:12 ...the way i CRY LAUGHED--
I remember being part of the user research for bratz dolls the year before they came out. I was 10 and got paid $20 to play with the dolls and answer questions about hwhat I thought of them. So yeah, I guess you could say I am the reason Bratz made it to market. You’re welcome.
i just want to thank you for the content you make. i was feeling really depressed today but watching your videos always puts me in a better mood. thank you kurtis !! 💕:))
Kurtis. Im chocking on my grapefruit. Please a warning next time.. i can’t be laughing randomly like this =.......    P.s. send help
bro have you ever been chased by a goose? them things are ruthless. they can be small but my god they go for the kill
These movies feel like a fever dream
these new vids have been so good we’ve been blessed
Pls shave your moustache
Whoa I didn’t know I was in the bratz movie
Ok I haven't watched this all the way through yet but I saw tHat WeASIl and oh boy I'm in for a ride aren't i
Both Barbie and bratz were my childhood
The disappointment you have with yourself after you make a shitty joke is so fucking funny
Kurtis likes Bratz more than Barbie? Time to unsubscribe
But… you promised…. An extra greeting🥺🥺🥺
Manekenpis is in fact a gnome
Stop pitting successful women against eachother 😤 😭
ya hoo da ba yo
Lol there was this Barbie nutcracker movie that I used to love when I was little. I still have it on VHS. I should find a VCR and re watch it. It’s probably hilarious now
No extra greeting? unsubcribed.
why is nobody comenting on the lack of extra greetings
kelly is the lost child of chucky & tiff
You really summoned all the Barbie movie fans- I am one of them
All I have to say is that the Bratz series is some of the best content I've ever seen
If I don't get an extra greeting at least give me an extra goodbye bruh
Kurtis :Very really good! Moi:ViRgIn !
So no one is gonna talk about the extra greeting thing? That's awesome. We know you were tired of it, Kurt, we respect your decision ❤️
Kurtis is a virgin
YOU SAID EVERY TIME 😭😭😭
The weasel moaning is now stuck in my head someone help
I love both dolls now, but I wasn't allowed to play with Bratz as a child... so Barbie holds a place in my heart 💗
#KurtisConnerIsOverParty
Kurtis: “You can take the Barbie asshole idea, we’ll call it even” Barbie: “BALLZ”
I watched bratz fashion pixies again recently and loved every second of it, I’m surprised we didn’t see the shot of Bri or maybe it was Simbolene being shot at the mum tree, ICONIC
The Barbie movies were better than the Bratz, but I know that they did so much for young girls of color. Seeing that representation and diversity as a child after seeing only Barbies on the shelf made such a great impact on my life.
bratz and barbie were both my shit. whenever i played i had barbie and ken be the parents while the bratz were the teenagers lmao
wrong barbie movie to watch. rewatch barbie and the diamond castle and bratz kidz fairy tales
virgin 🤣🤣
I’m leaving, not cause of the extra greeting thing, but because you aren’t reviewing Barbie and the Diamond castle
omg KING video hasn’t started yet what’s the opinionnnnn
kurtis ilysmm but please no mustache 😊❤️
The only beef i care about
I watched this movie constantly so I could play the dress up game included on the disc and I thought you had to watch the whole movie to play the game :|
"A flying unicorn"= Pegasus
I'm sincerely disappointed Kurtis didn't watch Bratz Super Babyz
10:17 shouldve put a picture of Jacob here IMSORRYY IM SORRY
ya hooo da ba yo
Ok but why is the Barbie Fairy Secret movie incredibly similar to the Bratz movie I-
This was the wrong video to listen to while grocery shopping.
didnt know niall did voice acting
Kurtis I agree the bratz one was better but pls Mr. Mayor watch Barbie and the 12 Dancing Princesses its so good
ily
very really good? more like very really BAD at spelling the word virgin
Okay but Princess and the Pauper is the superior film in the Barbie Cinematic Universe, or the BCU.
I knew the day was coming where the intro died. It was being slowly weened off for a while. I support you! #kurtisconnerisNOToverparty
Monster High is superior to both
I loved fashion pixies so much as a kid omg, I watched it at least 20 times….
Kurtis without the extra greeting is like a rebellious bad boy. I like that
barbie life in the dreamhouse pls n thx xoxoxoxo
Holy fuck thank you sir
"Get away with yourself" the gnome is using Gaelic grammar in English which is typical in hiberno-english we stan
We need a Barbie and the 12 dancing princesses reaction
NOT THE JAMES CHARLES APOLOGY LMFAO
Why no extra greeting :,(
Remember when there was a time people said Barbies had a bad influence on kids because of the unrealistic beauty standards and some people said that wasn' true because a simple doll wouldn't do all that? lmao well,it seems they are wrong, if you look at what's popular, almost everyone does surgery to look like a Bratz doll lol
I was literally not allowed to have Bratz when I was growing up
When he said “I didn’t mean it Iam desperate“ MY JAW DROPPED
The video I have been waiting my whole life for
Why would you pick a Bratz movie that's NOT Rock Angelz honestly
"so no hedwig?" immediately made me smash that like button
im a young woman spending my saturday night watching a grown man reviewing barbie movies
Kurtis should watch Bratz babies the superhero one
WHERE IS THE EXRTA GREETING
I hate that I could solve all of the Barbie plotholes because I watched that movie so many times
My main issue with these movies is how some of the character designs don't remotely fit in with the main character designs 😂 but I loved these growing up so much nostalgia watching this
please make more✨
“dylan’s backpack is stolen by a crow” kaz brekker: 👁👄👁
i absolutely loved this video! so freaking hilarious!
u should have done bratz rock angels because that goes hard
no because i remember being a kid, and my sisters and i would make fun of all the kids in Barbie movies because of how fucking hideous they were
kurtis should have watched a barbie movie with bibble in it 😔 he is an icon
ok but the bratz horror movie scared the sht out of me when a was little
Hedwig is a girl
Either youve reposted this video or i seen somebody else talk about this movie cause i remember this weasel being talked about
Bratz fashion pixies was my life, my water, and my air as a child and I forgot about it until now
I wasn't allowed to play with with Bratz cause my mum didn't like the name haha
When’s the monster high video?
I never let go of my Bratz, i have a box with all my stuff still lol soon as they came out, i kindly retired barbie
First I don't get my second greeting, THEN YOU INSULT BARBIE CINEMA TO MY FACE? You're on thin ice, Kurtis.
Gothel is the girlboss blueprint
I wonder if there's enough content out there to do something on Adults who still watch Arthur...
Great vid !!
You need to watch My Scene Masquerade Madness
I like Kurtis doing what he wants, but the extra greeting is an iconic Kurtis Conner staple.
Hot take: My scene goes Hollywood is way better than Barbie and bratz movies.
The second you said “small soldiers” and showed the movie poster a core childhood memory just unlocked within me
I SUBSCRIBED FOR THE EXTRA GREETING I WONT STAND FOR THIS
wow. no extra greeting? am i even real?
Kurtis didn't even comment on it but omg? I HATED when Stephan just like, wraps both his hands completely around Barbie's waist
I hope no kids find this video, they’ll be scared for life 🤦🏼‍♀️😂😂
Ball scrolls? More like scrolltums
Me: *Reads title*  Me: "Barbie" Me: *Closes YouTube*
THE END OF THE VIDEO💀 Bless you Kurtis 😂
Unfortunately, most of the horny weasels in Hollywood are behind the camera :/
Hey Kurtis just checking in to see if you're ok buddy.   (The video was hilarious 10/10)
Kurtis.....I’m hurt 😔 BARBIE SUPREMACY.
Kurtis please repaint your nails the chipped nail polish is bothering me
23:14 i paused my video came back an hour later to this. Kurt wideface
ya hooo da ba yo
for an extra greeting kurtistown’s residents must now acquire the new season pass
wow this dude is DEFO a virgin 🙄
bratz supremacy
No princess and the pauper OR island princess for Barbie sheeeeeeesh didn’t even give her a chance
I watched this VHS at least 400 times as a kid. Shout out to Swan Lake too.
I enjoy watching your videos.
i laughed out loud at the nome as an irish person that he said 'girls' in Irish. i never noticed that as a kid
Barbie has the best movies and Bratz has the best dolls
What the heck? I always thought that movie was called Toy Soldiers??
The more I watch kurtis the more I think he is garfield in human flesh.
"Could a virgin have a podcast?" ....Well I mean Ben Shapiro does
Great video Kurtis, i agree with your Bratz rating - that movie was my favourite out of all the bratz' when i was a kid.  P.s my mom says to keep growing out your hair. it looks nice :)
this video makes the doll community proud 👍🏼
i wasn't allowed to have bratz cuz my mom thought they were a bad influence
I hate how long the "balls" echo lasts
Petition for Kurtis to watch a Monster High film next
The sound effects killed my ears
I’m clicking off because I don’t get my extra greeting
I am greatly disappointed and deeply hurt by your doing mr kurtis, you are the one and only mayor we have and you treat us like that no extra greeting nothing! Treating us like strangers I feel uncared for ,unloved I don’t feel like a citizen of this town.  I request an apology NO! We request an apology from you mr kurtis kurtisten
Love that the pixies are just Cyber goths
I own/owned the PC video game Barbie (TM) as Rapunzel . played the HECK out of it.
Funny, funny. I just got a college assignment to write a communication strategy for a Barbie Teenager Clothing Line and I am so gonna mix her typical style with the bratz style. And here comes this video. Is it fate?
This is an extremely important video, i highly appreciate
You do not have to do the extra greeting. I was just thinking the other day how that joke must be stale as fuck for you at this point and I do not think anyone should blame you for abandoning it.
_Rapuzel is balled now_ Stfu  Good job
I’ve been waiting for Kurtis to comment on the bratz and barbie movies. I’m particular bratz bc they’re all so funny for no reason at all
Barbie is for little b*tches meanwhile Bratz is for bad b*tches ✌️😗
also, that Irish gnome...yea...em...no comment
I WANT MY EXTRA GREETING KURTIS IM ONLY SUBSCRIBED FOR THAT 1 REASON
The quality of this channel has never been bad but I know yall feel it too.. We getting on some next level quality, he snappin lol
Me, a virgin with a podcast: 😦
Kurt put the weasel noise on the virgin podcast soundboard
Scrotum Scrolls or "Scroltums" were a common way that men from as early as the 14th century, and well into the 18th century, sent pictures of their genitals to women they wished to court and had seen, but never spoken too.
Gosh Kurt boy I will be staying unsubscribed until I get my ding dang extra greeting!
"Do I wanna gnome?" kurtis Conner X Arctic Monkeys, The collar I needed
24:04 🥵🥵
Bless you
18:59 THE SHADE THROWN
Quality content
Dude the little dragon couldn't fly at first due to fear of heights that's why she didn't help Rapunzel at first
you chose the worst barbie movie and based your opinion on that! How is that fair!
Unsubbed, no greeting….
literally how is doll drama breaching the doll community. I had a lock on doll drama commentary ☠ anyway always be pluggin dailylivesofdolls on insta
Also the lawsuit had to do with the fact the creator of Bratz worked for Mattel when he had the idea for Bratz
Incase anybody was wondering, if it were possible to grow your hair that long (which unfortunately it isn’t), you could lift someone with it without it hurting your head just as long as you had a different object between you and the person you’re lifting to take the force (like in barbie she wraps it around the window stones, in tangled she has a hook on the ceiling)
sigourny weezer
Should we cancel him again?
Haha Ball Scrawls
I subscribed for the extra greeting. Unsubed not cool man
'- and Dylan twerks about it, which is a total power move'
When I was a kid I drew a helix fossil (from Pokémon) on a little slip of paper and buried it a few inches underground in hopes that it would grow into a real life Pokémon the next morning. I was upset the next morning to find my plan didn’t work.
I have no stake in this discussion one way or the other I just have to say that the Bratz song "Clothes make the girl" ABSOLUTELY slaps and that's all that matters to me
Am I the only one who thought this related to the youtube vs tictoc fight?
Hello yes I need help. What Bratz movie were the three blond girls from. They were like baddies and the two were twins and the main one was older. I just remember them being clumsy and hillarious.
If I could go an entire Kurtis video with breaking down cackling that’d be great thanks
I am unsubscribing until I get my extra greeting gosh darn kurt boy!
I didn't get my second greeting and that makes me sad
Everytime I see VRG all I can read is Verga
I love Bratz more than Barbie but I love the Barbie movies!
barbie and the 12 dancing princesses was the movie that i would watch every summer in my grandparents house it is a childhood, timeless classic
man with 80s hair and moustache talks about products for little girls for half an hour
oh i misread this i thought this was Barbie vs Barbz and got very invested in the discourse nicki minaj had with barbie dolls
thought this video was good. would like to see more yes👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
*please, she sounds like a deodorant*
Bless you
The echoing “balls” is taking me out ☠️
why did you tell me to get a snack as soon as i unpaused the video from getting a snack D:
I’ve been waiting FOR THIS ONE
Just to clarify for those who haven’t seen the absolute masterpiece that is barbie as rapunzel (not even being sarcastic), the plot does explain why she can’t just fly away on penelope the dragon. Gothel cast a wall of protection around the castle so that nobody would find them in the woods and it’s impassable unless you fly over the top and throughout the film penelope tries to fly over but can’t because she’s afraid of heights and falls down! No plot holes here
Can Kurtis just make a mini-series of some of the Barbie movies? I need to witness this in my lifetime
These movies were both such a huge part of my childhood
Kurtis you are the best, I’d never think you’d talk about Barbie movies, which are my religion. Thank you 🙏
“see what happens when you subscribe to my channel? you get an extra greeting at the beginning of every video except for those two times”
(Edit: Im talking strictly about the older ones that looked like barbie dolls, not the newer animated ones) The barbie movies were my fucking childhood and in my eyes still hold up to this day as good movies Also Princess and the Pauper music fuckin slaps, but thats just me. Bratz on the other hand was a train wreck
ya hooo da ba yo
haven’t even watched the video yet but Barbie wins hands down
Barbie vs. Bratz... why are you pinning two bad bitches against each other? /j
You owe me a GREETING
Could this be it? Could this be the video were Kurtis breaks free from his extra greeting curse? I think the fuck not
k now, barbie life in the dream house is superior
Never thought he’d have a video on my childhood
this is easily the funniest video ive ever seen in my entire life. not even the funniest kurtis video, just the funniest video in the world
Kurty boy this video is really good thank you for it I could not stop laughing the whole time
Oie! What about poor old forgotten Betty Spaghetty... my poor girl spent her entire lif in the shadows of bratz
BRATZ ALL DA WAY
you have to watch an episode of barbie life in the dreamhouse it's one of the funniest shows ever
“Can virgins have podcasts?”  Haven’t u listened to the Joe Rogan experience??
Excuce you. Hedwig is a she.
This video is very chaotic
The music in the bratz movie SMACKS
Ya hooo da ba yo
Great video, loved it   .....but still deeply offended I ain’t get no extra greeting
#BAB #Bratzarebetter
the animals im the barbie movie are so uncanny i hate it
Rapunzel was my favorite movie for too many years. I hope you don’t talk trash about it.  Edit: dammit
i started crying when you said you werent gonna give me an extra greeting i had to go to another one of your videos to watch the intro to calm down
flying unicorn... you mean pegasus?
I loved bratz way more than barbie because my sisters and i could pick which one we liked more. I loved Jade's grungey vibes and my sisters liked yasmin and chloe. We all had individuality when playing bratz dolls, instead of all being the same blonde barbie in 3 sizes.
this used to be my favorite barbie movie wtf
I collected Bratz dolls as a kid. I used to play Bratz rock angelz on GC. That was bad.
2:53 Please Kurtis, have some respect for the Greendale flag
Now could you watch Bratz genie magic versus like Barbie and the twelve dancing princesses? Pretty please 🥺
idc but barbie movies were my entire childhood and i will forever love the movies no matter how cringy they are
willhem means willy on german i swear 💀
The best Barbie movies are The 3 Musketeers, The 12 Dancing Princesses, and The Princess and the Pauper. If you disagree you are wrong and you can’t change my mind.
I was always a Monster High kid. Although will say; Barbie had more of my favorite movies as a kid, Bratz in general had more enjoyable dolls. So I think both have merit.
kurtis i think you missed the part where penelope was scared to fly and couldn't fly as high as her dad
Double video bundle pack 👍
a bit nostalgic how  i havent seen the bratz movie in YEARS omg
I unsubscribed because I didn't get my extra greeting.... Very disappointed in you Kurtis, you let me down :(
16:35 sounds like something a *VRG* would say
Who said that in the comments. Who called him a vrg? Step forward.
Kurtis tasteless confirmed!!!
ya hooo da ba yo
Barbie wins purely for the existence of Bibble
I didn't get my extra greeting >:(  Unsubscribing
I used to live in Portland and saw a man pleasuring himself while leaning on a fire hydrant... that poor gnome:(
Kurtis gonna be on the FBI watch list for all the research he to do for this video.
Barbie Princess and the Pauper is hands down the best
Do a rematch!
Uhm wait! I thought this was Barbie vs the Barbz! Let me sleep
I got the best of both worlds. I was a fan of both and honestly I enjoyed Barbie movies more but I like bratz dolls better
My sister's favorite Barbie movie was this one and we had it on DVD and bc we had nothing else to do I've seen the movie like a million times and I still kind of hate it
Give him to me~ auughhh 😩😩  Y’all remember that video popping up in your recommended?
Only virgins have podcast
ok now watch a monster high movie
From me, to all those who missed a greeting today: What’s up, I hope you’re doing really great today.
as per usual Kurt has me in TEARS
Oh no u picked the worst bratz movie. But probably the one everybody remembers most.. 😥
I literally watched that Bratz movie as a child and thought it was a fever dream for so long
I love how we go from things like speedrunning a game to Disney adults to Y2K to barbies/bratz😂 Kurtis could talk about anything and I'd watch
chose the worst barbie movie doe
I haven't even started the video yet and I'm so stoked. Barbie was my whole life for too long. Can't wait to see how she stacks up against the Bratz (which I wasn't allowed to watch because, you know, they kinda trashy, dawg)😂
barbie in a mermaid tale is 100% the best barbie movie of all time and i stand by that
Bro Ily lmao. This is great, Im sending to the two Bratz facebook groups Im in.
I am ridiculously happy that you addressed the Bratz Pixie rave scene. That wasn't one of the movies I grew up with, but my friend saw it as a child and it terrified her. So one night we decided to watch the movie together so she could relive it and I could witness it for the first time, and it made me laugh so hard that when I woke up the next morning I felt like I had strep throat. Anyway, that scene will forever be iconic in my mind.  On a different note, the soundtrack for that movie SLAPS.
kelly saying “balls” echoes through my mind sm now
Moving out 🧳
drew gooden grew hair
Only virgins call Chelsea Kelly
Extra greeting?...
as a hispanic every time i see the vrg, i read "verga" ....
I read the title as barbie vs barbie and I thought Kurtis was gonna pick his favourite barbie movie
ya hooo da ba yo
Currently watching this while on break at work and sadly imma have to watch the last like 2 min later but this is the best thing to see while on break so ty kurtboy for the content :))
That pixie party reminds me too much of Devilman Crybaby's Black Sabbath.
No please do princess and the pauper or swan lake for Bratz and then the rock angels or the ones with the genie or there a kids one you might like
This is barbie swan lake and barbie princess and the pauper erasure
That's my favorite Bratz movie 🥺🥺🥺
Maybe he should put the extra greeting at the end of the video as a subtitle or really anything subtle Just an idea
You gotta shave that stach Kurtis...
Hey Kurtis I work at a bank so maybe chill with the ad 😂
Fun fact when I was a kid I had a prince Stephan doll, and it was the kind where if you pressed a button he’d say a line from the movie. But I put him in the bathtub so every time you pressed the button it would just make this really weird high pitched noise.
No kurtis please dont take my extra greeting im begging you
Hello Komrade Kurtis! If you are old enough to remember the horrifying Canadian kids show "Kideo" that was like Kiss on LSD crossed with a food poisoning fever dream... Maybe it could be a video idea. I still have nightmares about it, and sometimes I wake with marks on my flesh! Keep up the good work my boy!
Barbie Swan Lake fucking HAUNTS my dreams.
I have never clicked a video faster omg thank you Kurtis
their tongue wouldn’t be cold but it would be pretty numb
No extra greeting?? WHY DID I SUBSCRIBE THEN??
Soooo, no more extra greetings.... ? 🥺🥺😭😭😭😭💔💔💔
can you restock the very really good merch pretty pleaseee
OKAY BUT MONSTER HIGH IS NEXT KURTIS
I haven’t even watched this & I’m triggered 😤😡
Bratz are superior 😇
Kurtis Conner is slowly transforming into Frank Zappa
no extra greeting??? what if this was my last straw, kurtis?? what then????
I was mad at u for not giving us an extra greeting, but then u reminded me of chalk zone... Your sins are forgiven
That mustache tho
are we just gonna ignore the fact that kurtis doesn’t know what a pegasus is?
2:46 made me laugh
I never watched a barbie movie or even saw a bratz doll, which is weird since I was 10 in 2001 and super into barbies and dolls
I wasn't allowed to have Bratz dolls because their tops showed their belly buttons 😔
The chase scene in Rapunzel was my introduction to asmr lol
I have a love hate relationship with Bratz cuz i liked it as a kid, but as an adult there are some really problematic aspects. But it's more inclusive and diverse, both regarding race like Kurtis said but also fashion styles; there's lots of cutesy styles that are great, but there are also punk and goth lines of dolls, and you likely noticed the spooky atmosphere of fashion pixies. Plus bratz has more attitude and edge to it What I'm trying to say is, I would like an edgy Bratz tv reboot now pls
I’m biased towards Barbie SOLELY for Barbie Princess and the Pauper. That movie is iconic.
The fact that Kurtis and I had the same reaction to do I wanna gnome -   Sir why would you say that ???
weird fun fact, the women who made barbie went to my high school! barbie and ken are named after her daughter and son which is semi uncomfortable but whatever
Dylan is such a care free soul
What do you call Jerry Seinfeld when works at a pub?  A bar-bee! .............please laugh.
why... why didn't he do the extra greeting??
My collector self Is happy with this video
I love these comments, these are my people. #justuceforbarbie ‼️😩
love you
Not only did we not get a second greeting but we didn't even get a first greeting what the f***
barbie better boo
no extra greeting? what did i even sub for
i may need kurtis to cover every single barbie and bratz movie
With out watching its Barbie rePunzel hands-down
PLEASE Kurtis NEVER MISSES
the barbie animation looks like the sims 2 in the worst way possible
Wrong, Hedwig is a girl 😔
"why stay on topic when you can simply not?" same
STOP PITTING QUEENS AGAINST EACH OTHER!
My mom hates that the feet would pop off 😂
kurtis please give me my extra greeting its my only antidepressant
Barbie in the Nutcracker is the best Barbie movie!!
not me doing a double-take after he said hobi... #streambutter 💜
Unsubscribed. Extra greeting or no game.
if you think the weasel is weird you should see chuzzlewit from barbie a Christmas carol...
the shade at youtuber apologies is always so good
I grew up on Barbie movies and this brings up so many cursed childhood memories
You have to do a review of "My Scene: Jammin' in Jamaica"
idk if it’s just because im on 40 minutes of sleep but 7:17 made me laugh so hard i cried. ive been needing to cry for like 2 months but haven’t been able to so i appreciate your work kurtis
I feel very insulted as a subscriber not getting my extra greeting! 😂😂
Barbie 4 life
Kelly do be looking like what stubbing your toe feels like
First of all, it's barbie and the secret door or fuck off and secondly it's barbie and the secret door or fuck off
Kurtis is bringing the chaos today
this has to be kurtis' most adhd video to date
never doubted you Kurtis, bratz for the win!
You picked the best barbie movie good job
THIS IS ONEOF YOUR FUNNIEST VIDEOS EVER I LOVE YOU
VRG really stands for  Very Repetitive  Greeting That's why Kurtis didn't do it this time, lol
Thank you for freeing us of the intro.. growth is good.
there is something about a socially aware guy that rejects toxic masculinity and misogyny that to be blunt, gets me really hot.
Conner : Do a virgin got a podcast.   Me, a virgin : No. Guys, I guess I'm SERIOUSLY a virgin.
Please do Bratz Rock Anglez next it’s one of the best 😭🤚🏽
I'm so glad you watched Fashion Pixiez because I tried to watch it recently and I cried at that 6 minute scene of Dylan getting his backpack back
**angry twerking**
Barbie walked to sophia could run
Bless him for somehow making the exact kind of niche movie review content we all didn’t know we needed to see
Woodchipper? I hardly know her
Oh no, Barbie Rapunzel is the worst movie ever
Ya hooo da ba yo
“I’m not a virgin”... Kurtis’s mustache makes a bold claim (bolstered by his mullet)
B alls A re L uxurious L eisure S tations
Was that the Greendale community college flag?
Only a virgin would give no extra greeting
I loved the Bratz and Barbie movies. My family spoiled me with both of their merchandise so I was a big fan of both. They're also both good for meme material.
“Do I want to gnome” KILLED ME LMFAOOO it was so dumb but I loved it 💀
"dost thou curtains match thou drapes"
As an Irish person who was a big fan of Bratz as a child, I feel honoured to be represented by the garden gnome, proud cailín right here <3
Kurtis, this a threat, if I don't get my extra greeting, ima turn your veins into shoelaces
When he said "do I wanna Gnome" that's when I pressed like
Gesundheit
That weasel bouta make me act down🤢
Oh my god this made me die of laughter 12:20
I remember watching the Barbie as repunzel movie as a kid. Dunno how I didn’t catch on to how odd the weasel thing was
I loved Barbie and bratz dolls and movies as a kid lol. I think Barbie has better movies like plot and animation wise. And like they actually have lots of emotionally fulfilling ones too. But I’ve always loved the bratz universe that the movies take place in. I always wanted to live there
When you don’t get your extra greeting😭💔
Bratz is ironically good. Rapunzel is mediocre
Why did my brain remember every moment of that Barbie movie the second it came on screen, I am ✨triggered ✨
I think when I was a v small child, I was a Brat for Halloween… Didn’t even need a costume! …JK no I’ve always been an angel… A Bratz ROCK Angel 😎  (I hate me too, but no shame rly bc this is a Kurtis comment section yk)
WAS THAT AN ARCTIC MONKEYS REFERENCE?? 😂
Barbie as Rapunzel was an AMAZZIIIIING movie I'm feeling so nostalgic
4:59 manz is over here insulting my forehead that is the same size as Kelley's *cries*
About the intro, yeah change to the way u want it!
this felt kind of like a fever dream of a video. I love it
Not misgendering Hedwig
We he doesn’t know that Hedwig is a girl😭
the sneeze at the end sounded like a Dad Sneeze™
When Kurtis was bald at the Rapunzel scene it really reminded my of my alcoholic uncle SHHSBDVE
Please make a full version of Rapunzel is bald
I left this video offended. Mattel, sponsor me.
18:58 gotta be loving the shade lmao
Isn’t Hedwig a girl?
princess and the pauper swan lake and 12 dancing princesses ensure barbies victory 😌
10:12 I'm unsubscribing why didn't you make a hedwig (head wig) joke
Therapist: "bald Kurtis Conner doesn't exist."  10:15 ME: *deceased*
PENELOPE IS SCARED OF FLYING HIGH WHICH IS WHY SHE CAN'T JUST DO THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE, KURTIS!!!
heck you make the extra greeting i subscribed for a reason and it was NOT for your “creative talented content” 😒
Rapunzel used the Mario 64 paintings
This is my lil essay. As a passionate toy collector in their 20’s I gotta say, Barbie not only allowed girls to be a part of the toy game when they were initially left out, and, even though it may not have been intentional, she paved the way for female empowerment through toys, letting girls know they could be, say, or do anything they wanted. BUT, and it’s a BIG but, Bratz provided a monumental level of inclusivity and diversity to where ANY child with ANY hair, skin, or eye color combination could walk into a store and find a cute ass doll that looked exactly like them. While the Bratz may have not had many “careers” in their time they did travel the world in their little girl squad. Sure guys may have been with them and this and that but their main focal point was a diverse group of girls that got along and gassed each other up. We can’t NOT thank Barbie for all that she’s done but we also HAVE to praise Bratz for not only including every child at the time, but for teaching anybody who was a big fan back in the day the importance of friendship, female power, and mf fashion. Not to mention.. every girl that played with Bratz as a kid back in the day looks like Bratz doll now. Barbie is an OG but the Bratz are THE DAMN THING.
Idc what anyone else in the comments has to say, Barbie's Rapunzel is objectively the best movie ever made and that music-less chase scene is iconic
Monster high dolls are still superior, just saying..
you look like my neighbor
Safe to say the barbie slander is not being accepted kurtis we demand a rematch
Kurtis AND Danny posting on the same day 🤯
The MEMORIES those Rapunzel scenes brought back tho
I'm sorry but I have to say it. Barbie and the 12 dancing princesses is the god tier Barbie movie. Stop denying it.
This is crazy! I love both of these licenses and brands. They are iconic! I recommend Kurtis play one game from each license. Bratz Diamondz PS2 is amazing because you can have a pet and go ice skating! I never played any of the Barbie games, but I’d watch his stream if he did. 👀
kurtis flying unicorns are known as pegasi (plural of pegasus). please correct your mistake.
I think Kurtis is a virgin guys but idk just a theory
If you grew up with bratz it’s like “oh you don’t have a father now” and your hair is dyed plus you’re attracted to women (or men who played with them could be bi lmao) then Barbie you definitely grew up with a white suburban mom and can’t come out if you are lgbt
Bratz wins just for giving us “do I wanna gnome” and “I’m desperate *whomp whomp whooooom*”
kurtis wtf ur mustache looks amazing
ah yes, the video that everyone needed
The barbie movies were great. They were a huge part of my childhood and i loved themmm
Isn't Hedwig a female tho😳
Okay but the Bratz Halloween Sleepover movie was the superior Bratz movie
Funny joke man
The barbie movies are so magical 🥺🥺 he should of watched princess and the pauper too, the music is amazing
I have spent way too much time watching so many people review Barbie movies and this is by far my favorite review I've seen yet.
please review bratz: sleepover adventure that shit traumatized me as a kid
The bratz Halloween movie was traumatizing as a kid like my god
Kurtis doesn’t know the can of worms he’s opened in this community 🙃
Lena made me figure out I liked women when I was 4
ya hooo da ba yo
How is no one talking about My Scene's Jammin In Jamaica???? It goes so fucking hard
sighourny weasel
I like bratz better, but just because barbie movies were watched when i was baby and bratz in tweens
kurtis needs to watch barbie swan lake
i mean if i was being chased by a gnome from CORK?? i would die on the spot for sure dude
Gothel seems like a ripoff of Shapoklyak (Soviet cartoon villain). Including the weasel and everything lol.
Bratz king!
*B* *A* *L* *L* *S*
I was born in England, my parents were going to name me Shelly, but in England Barbie's little sister was named Shelly... So they named me Kelly, and we promptly moved to the states before my second birthday. Way to go mom and dad.
"Allow me mistress 😩😩😩😩".   Bratz and these bad CGI movies weren't around when I was a kid... Thankfully.  But I feel really old now.
My mom was one of those parents that refused to buy me bratz dolls because she thought they were to slutty. Sorry mom but I am a slut now. It didn’t help
lina was my gay awakening as a kid
i think we can all agree bratz has better fashion taste, like the popular indie, rock, and bohemian styles…barbie just wears the same thing…pink, purple and OCCASIONALLY blue. We never see barbie go outside of her usual basic, tacky, and “modest” clothing. Parents didnt like bratz because they weren’t considered “normal for the time”.
My mom absolute thought that the Bratz dolls were too slutty for some reason and I wanted Jasmine SO bad! I feel like they were more…street?
Omg I forgot about Small Soldiers I need to watch that immediately
can u review bratz forever diamondz pls
this video unlocked so many memories for me
I think a study was done once where with seventy feet of hair and a prince at sixty pounds it's still too much weight and Rapunzel's neck would snap
PLEASE WATCH AND RATE MYSCENE MOVIES!!!!
I will never watch Rapunzel the same ever again. “all these B A L L Z” IM CRYING
Nothing is more disturbing than being chased by a gnome with a thick Irish accent. That is my paralysis demon
Finally Kurtis. This is literally all I care about.
My parents were one of the ones mad about Bratz dolls. I wasn’t allowed to have them or play with them.
ok now do bratz vs monster high
KURTIS' DANCING
6:50 Ball scrolls is absolutely one of the best jokes you've made. Hold up bro, gotta send my girl some ball scrolls
the barbie repubzel movie absolutely slapped
I’ll have to admit bratz dolls are better but barbie fairytopica slapped me harder than I like
Never in my life would I ever experience kurtis reviewing bratz and Barbie movies a surprise to be sure but a welcome one
kurtis you are 27 years old. why are you making videos about childrens toys.
I have to watch Barbie princess school at least once a year because it's so good
CHALK ZONE?!!! U PUT DA LIME IN DA COCONUT AND SHAKE IT ALL UP
You always have me crackin up 😂😂😂
Please do this again but include Monster High
Man I miss the old kurtis, like when he was a virgin, and still gave us extra greetings.
But does anyone else remember the barbie tv channel !??
1:38 why tf is no one talking about how uncomfortable this dancing animation is
21:58 TOOK ME OUT LMAO
So who else is wondering why Kurtis didn't mention the scene where Rapunzel paints herself into avant-garde ballroom dresses? That scene alone is worth all 13 Bratz movies.
Omg Barbie as Rapunzel was my childhood I had a dvd of it
this is my fav video ever i need another one
“Do I want to gnome.” I didn’t know you played D&D, Kurtis.
You should watch these kurtis, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L65kKBX9muE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyqyItdStjY
“Give him to me UAH😫😩”
PLEASE stop using the sugar pine 7 triumphant music. I know it's probably copyright free music available to everyone but every time I hear it, I'm brought back to the sp7 days and it's so weird lol.
Literally always thought Bratz was owned by Barbie so my mind is a little blown right now.
How is the balding dad in a Hawaiian shirt saying “I banished you eternally” not a meme already.
lmao barbies asshole was the greendale flag
oh. you woke up and chose violence I see.
Kurtis please... the greeting
why do white men always think it’s their place to comment on things little girls like 😬 this is weird, kurtis
Ya hoo da ba yo
Ok I do like bratz more but Barbie would’ve had a way better shot with princess and the pauper or 12 dancing princesses
He is not a virgin guys! The creep mustache proves it!
Bro that horny weasel lives rent free in my mind now
pls review barbie: life in the dream house
disliked because no extra greeting :/ like wtf
Ok, I deadass forgot until this video but I own a stuffed Penelope.  I knew nothing about the movie, but when you squeezed her paw she said "I am a mighty dragon" in a sassy voice so twenty year old me was like YES THIS IS A QUALITY PURCHASE.  I still have it.  Thank you for surfacing this serotonin core memory, Kurtis.
Pitting women against eachother like this is messed up Kurtis
I never expected for kurtis to have a video about this topic but i’ll watch
i dont know about you but i think "do i wanna gnome" is a stroke of comedic genius
kurtis i dont know how you stole your way into my childhood memories but you picked BOTH of the movies that defined my childhood. like--i watched BOTH of these religiously and out of ALL the bratz and barbie movies you couldve picked, you picked my favorites. thank you
23:38 Tbf people have been dancing like that at raves for years.
Mattell me that made me snort so loud
Ya, I'll never understand why some guys feel the need to send Dick Pics. I've always thought Scrote Notes do the job just fine.
this Barbie Repunzel hate is uncalled for 😤
It should have been Princess and the Pauper not Rapunzel😩
13:34 wtf?! Is that what I think it is?
Bless you Kurtis
Every clip of Otto absolutely kills me. Preminger is still more iconic though.  Kurtis please watch Princess and the Pauper. It's so good!
Some people in the comments being fighting over Bratz or barbie about who had better doll designs, but’s be real, ever after high dolls had the best designs.
Your merch plug gave me real Rick and Morty little bits vibes
Sorry but barbie movies were the best braz movies were really bad
yes i do remember chalk zone with the cool theme song
One has the same girl, the other has a bunch of differently same girls
Excuse me, hey. I subscribed for the extra greeting. What gives???
If you think Kelly is creepy, I can’t wait to see what you think of Tika from Island Princess!
BROOOO BRATZ FASHION PIXIES IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER FUCLSJSJWKSJSKDBDJSJ
I LOVE barbie movies, idk th plot isn't the best but its just so relaxing to watch
A man with this moustache talking about children’s dolls should immediately be added to a register TBH
I like this new vibe of yours, kurtis. Very cool.
How could you say something so controversial yet brave?
Kelly slander is completely allowed and appreciated
I grew up on barbie... yes on top of her- and when i was around 3 or 4 is the first time i saw the rapunzel movie and OMG I THINK IT TRAUMATIZED ME- mother gothel terrified me omg- hearing her voice again gives me vietnam flash backs LMAO
"Doth thou carpet match thy drapes?" Bahahahaha!!!!!
No extra greeting? then *V* stands for Very disappointing 😒  Unsubscribed.
no extra greeting on purpose??!??!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!!! this is so messed up
No joke, i actually really love barbie rapunzel since i was a child 🙃
"Matel, please don't sue me for that" lmao, i wasn't ready
Okay but Princess and the Pauper, and Diamondcastle are *elite*
Kurtis: cancels himself before anyone else has time to cancel him for not giving an extra greeting  Also Kurtis: I'm not doing it today and I don't care what u say 😎🖕🏻
Kids have BEEN disgusting Kurtis, Barbie didn't do that. Idk where you been thinking you've been some non-ugly non-weirdo children. Lmao, all fuckin weirdos.
Never thought I'd see my favourite creator talk about my childhood faves, but I'm living.
Kurtis, homie, a big part of the story is that the little dragon is bad at flying.
The fucking Irish accent from the gnome I NEED TO KNOW THE VOICE ACTOR
No extra greeting? Damn, i guess i'll unsubscribe until i get my fkn extra greeting >:(
Chulk zone and barbie. All the references today
Kurty ur really making it seem like your a virgin
its “MAGICAL”  hair
"does thou carpet match thy drapes?" LMFAO 💀💀💀
Only virgins don’t dk extra greetings Kurtis
Im so upset you didn't pick barbie in the princess and the pauper for the barbie movie 😭
PLEASE MAKE THIS A SERIES
will join all the other commenters in saying that you have to watch princess and the pauper or swan lake for barbie to win. no contest
4:11 now who has been assing kurtis? 😕
monster high was and still is superior
its my birthday today :)) im 15 <3
On the Barbie vs Bratz debate, Barbies felt more wholesome and the movies made you care. Not to mention the games, the GAMES! So good. Too good.
youre the funniest person
monster high dolls were superior.
that stash is a crime against humanity
there’s just something so special about bratz dolls and the movies
Saying Barbie had no competition till Bratz? Burn on Cindy. 🤣
“Big-eyed gals”
I'm going to assume that 2:55 was a Greendale flag reference and love Kurtis even more for it
Barbie: a fairy secret is slept on fr
Kurtis you look dashing
I’m at work but when I come back in one hour, he better be siding w the bratz 😌
Good for you Kurtis ((not a virgin))!! Stick it to the extra greeting fans!!
I wish you reviewed Bratz Rock Angels. Definitely slaps.
Okay but like the diamond castle SPLAPS it’s about to cottagecore lesbians-
I didn’t like either- however Bratz looked more fun than Barbie.  Also the fact that I watched the barbie movies ;-;
I thought this video was about the nickie Minaj fandom
Bratz sleepover is a cinematic masterpiece
Lmaoo go to 18:59
Stripped of my extra greeting!!! WTF IM CLICKING OUT RN KURT
Ugh the nostalgia… Bratz Fashion Pixiez is literally the best Bratz movie, I don’t make the rules. 7-year-old me does
We learned two things early on in this video:  1: Kurtis is not what he creates 2:Kurtis is not a virgin  We also know a third thing, outside of this video alone: He creates youtube videos  Therefore, Kurtis is a virgin.
dude what the fuck were you on while making this video
Gotta give it to Barbie. Those movies are literally elite. But bratz were literal baddies of only they put more money into the production
why does the bratz movie give me jimmy neutron vibes?
Okay…now you gotta talk about MyScene because the theme song has been stuck in my head since I was a kid. My brain just randomly presents it to me even though I haven’t heard it in years.
me when i get extra greeting: 🤠❤️‍🔥 me with no extra greeting: 😞💔
I haven't watched the video but Barbie is better I love both but Barbie is better
ive been cry laughing for 30 minutes
Nobody ever: Hisoka for no reason whatsoever: 11:01
I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMEMBERED CHALK ZONE PLEASE TALK ABOUT CHALK ZONE
How dare you Curtis. All the kids in the world are crying My whole family is crying bc you didn't greet them...  Just wow, Curtis.
Ok here’s my hot take: barbie had better movies but bratz had better dolls. Like with Barbie movies the magic world is generally pretty well designed and cohesive (when there’s a magic world in bratz it’s pretty wack, for example the gnome thing and boring magic character designs like come on little girls don’t want gnomes they want fucked up villain animal sidekicks and dragons), the animation holds up better than bratz (though that isn’t saying much lol), the clothes translate better from doll to movie (a lot of bratz movies just use basic outfits for most scenes instead of actual unique doll outfits to save on animation costs, and when they do implement the actual doll designs they all look samey in basic outfit shape and color scheme [take the pixies here for example, the basic structure of the outfits is mesh long sleeve-T-shirt-tutu-jeans, just with different placements of the same colors] and it all just makes it difficult to tell each character apart, whereas when barbie has other characters with her same face the outfits always look distinct even if they’re just gowns, the shapes and colors are different enough to be recognizable but still look good together. Though the bad 3d animation might contribute to the bratz looking bad, because in the one 2D movie they all look great so idk lol). And the Bratz dolls are better because of diversity (barbie princess dolls only came in two options, white or black, no in between), outfit variation (I know I dunked on them in the animation, but in doll form they look amazing, and the outfits are always more than just one gown so you can mix and match different clothing items), makeup (many distinct eyeshadow looks and some have really glittery lips which is fun, this does just come down to personal preference but to me as a kid I always thought it made each one look more interesting even among different iterations of the same character, whereas if you took all the barbie princess dolls and removed their clothes+accessories, their makeup would all be very similar), the proportions/art style is unique, I guess this one comes down to personal preference as well because nothing wrong with a basic semi-realistic thing barbie has going on. Ok damn I just wrote a whole essay. I have to say I’m really excited that bratz are coming back and I really hope they stay, because the current state of barbie is incredibly dull and I want to see mattel do better.
he really just picked the worst barbie movie
I completely forgot chalk zone existed until this moment
Weinstein should have at least been nominated for horny weasel
Disappointed by these results, barbie will always reign supreme when it comes to the movies.  I think the only logical conclusion is to gather more data by watching more barbie movies, keep the rivalry alive!
My sister WAS a proud citizen of kurtis town but she said your mustache was ugly so I did what any good person would do EVICT HER🌚
well, the "VRG" letters have a completely different meaning in spanish, and you're not gonna like it
cancel kurtis for not giving us an extra greeting AND not reviewing princess and the pauper
Bratz: Fashion Pixies was my childhood movie and even then we’d die laughing! It was so funny seeing Kurtis be so shocked at the scenes me and my family would put on a-b for hours!
KURTIS THE REASON WHY BARBIE WOULDN'T ESCAPE IS TO SAVE PENELOPE'S FATHER  sorry I was getting angry
Rapunzel is the worst Barbie movie you could have picked kurtis 😞
This might be my new favorite Kurtis video but the only thing I could think about was Jenna turning Julien into a Bratz doll
Every time I watch YouTube video, I usually get a greeting… Very disappointed that I did not get a greeting in this video. 2/10
The footsteps sound in the fight scene is the best, most satisfying part of the movie
Is that Pro Skater Johnny Giger or Pro Youtuber Kurtis Conner?? I seriously can't tell😂
The lack of an extra greeting made me legitimately sad
The girls, gays and theys have ASSEMBLED
This is the first new video that has been released since I subscribed, so I guess Ill never get that extra greeting I've heard so much about.
did he say the rabbits name is hobi?
Barbie life in the dreamhouse was 🔥.
Did anyone else have the Barbie Rapunzel Doll with the string that made her hair shorter when you pulled it...
My friend was a game tester for Barbie princess ponies. He said it was THE MOST mind-numbing job he’s ever had.
ya hooo da ba yo
the content I didn’t know I needed
18:50 kurtis questioning his life
In before Age Restriction
Important issues will be discussed based by the title of this video
the scariest thing in the barbie movies are those furries in swan lake and the TROLL
ya hooo da ba yo
So we’re not gonna talk about Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus?
Truly appreciate this content. It's the video we NEED in 2021
Wow the fact that this man didnt even cover the character development of Penelope who was AFRAID of heights (WHICH IS WHY SHE COULDNT FLY IN THR BEGINNING) and she over came that and regained the relationship with her father, THE AUDACITYY!!! Disappointed, af
bro, dude, buddy, pal: IT IS A MAJOR PART OF THE MOVIE THAT PENELOPE IS SCARED OF FLYING. Don’t disrespect my girl like that And do not shit on the music, I’m writing a whole ass paper about it
without my extra greeting i don't know how to go on
The best doll line turned into movies is 100%, in my opinion, Monster High. MH had SO much diversity and the whole premise of the dolls and media was to literally BE YOURSELF!!!
Bro… there are so much better Barbie movies. Why the heck did he pick this one!?!
I like tomatos
that is the stinkiest moustache i've ever seen on a virgin
Not me missing a piece of my heart that requires an extra greeting. Lol
18:44 Kurtis wtf did Alex Turner do to you to deserve that
bratz is better no question
This may be my favorite Kurtis Connor video so far. Total banger
PLS watch the bratz live action its a childhood fav
ya hooo da ba yo
Now he has to play the Barbie and Bratz video games, if he can stand how bad they both are.
I honestly haven't laughed this hard in a while
OH GOD THE BRATZ MOVIE OF MY CHILDHOOD-
My eight year old self is screaming right now.
Nothing is more terrifying than a gnome with a Kerry accent
"dylan walked so eboys could run their fingers through their hair" PLEASE WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THIS BANGER OF A SENTENCE
Does anyone else remember that Bratz movie where thare was like alien potatoes or was that just a weird fever dream 😂😅
(10:16) Yo that slaps! Make a full version if there’s not already and donate that charity for the public!
I'm real.... stop laughing at my forehead 😒 😑 jkjk
i feel like ive been absolutely spoiled today with kurtis kontent while ive got the day to myself and im so happy 🥲
i unironically love Barbie. Im influenced by nostalgia admittedly :D
why didnt he watch barbie princess charm school😐
Not kurtis unlocking memories that I didn't even know I had
i used to watch barbie as rapunzel every freaking day oh my goodness
Bratz👏🏽betch👏🏽 4EVR🙄👏🏽
I'm sorry, but "do I know to gnome" took me out. I wheezed.
Brats since they were inclusive since the jump 💗🥰✨
"dylan walked so eboys could run.. their fingers through their hair."  plsss that was so perfect- ✋😩
give me my extra greeting 😡😡😡😡😡😡
bless you 28:47
bless u @28:47
PEGA ELE. FRITA ELE. FAZ PURÊ.
Ok the Chalk Zone reference: there was a rapunzel episode and the song goes like “Rapunzel, Rapunzel let down your long hair.”
9:29 in the original broadway cast recording of into the wood the girl that plays Rapunzel shows her in pain while she is pulling up people
goddamn kelly has 30k holes to fall into, she must have fallen by now  CELEBRATE KELLY FALLING DOWN THE HOLE
Kurtis! You said after the Barbie movie that I had time to go get water and a snack but when I came back, you had already started the Bratz movie! That was not enough time by far!!
WHERES THE EXTRA GREETING KURTIS
Finally some serious journalism
Dear Mayor Kurt Boy, I need to know if you’re going to restock the last collection they designed bc what I wanted was always sold out. Solidarity, Alicia
Dylan must've eaten some takis. They're seriously intense!
I had that Barbi movie
all the evil pixies look like emo kids 😭
**angrily twerks**
Kurtis not watching Barbie princess and the pauper is a crime
It was on that fateful day when Kurtis purposefully skipped the extra greeting that millions across the world cried out in pain.
.
kurtis conner is so cool. i wish he was real:(
Billy from stranger things
The animation is not really that good
dylan was just vibing the whole movie
I'm not even going to watch the rest of this video. In fact, I'm going to 'unsubscribe' from this channel since you don't have the perks of being a subscriber anymore. You should be ashamed of yourself, Kurtis
Barbie’s “Princess and the Pauper” and “Swan Lake” have already ensured Barbie’s victory. Bratz is cool and all, but these are the facts. I believe in science.
all I need to know is how many Barbie and Bratz movies Kurtis watched for this video to pick one each
Funniest shit I’ve seen in months
Hedwig's a GIRL! 😆
Barbie wins. Haven’t even watched the video yet. Barbie wins a thousand times. There’s no possible way that Barbie could ever not win in this little competition.
''Theres the king, Stephen, idk anybody else's name'' so is the kings name just... The King?
Y'all remember that one Bratz babies movie?💀
the truly master we needed to make justice between the 2 enemies.. but dude, rapunzel?
My favorite movie was Mermaidia. I credit the blue and purple mermaid and the prince as the reason I'm bi
he missed out on the “nasty looking hole” JOKE
we just gonna brush over our girl cindy okay
As a bratz collector and a citizen of kurtis town, this was a very pleasant surprise 😊
now why did you choose these two movies,,, barbie and bratz have some BANGERS
INTENSE moustache
top three barbie movies: princess and the pauper, the barbie diaries and princess and the nutcracker
he's overcompensating. virgin
Rapunzel was my first Barbie movie. They effected my childhood greatly and I still own like 20 DVDs, mostly collected in my early adulthood. However, considering they're still publishing movies there are many way more representative examples. They also sound way better dubbed. *MOST IMPORTANTLY* if you squeezed the head of a Barbie doll from the sides all of them would look like the the evil lady in Rapunzel
This is officially my favorite video that u have created….also I’m team bratz they have way better representation. And their clothes are very fashionable
these were the two i was hoping for omg i had these on dvd 😵☃️
Y’all can drag me but I think the best Barbie movies are Princess and the Pop star and Barbie Princess Charm School
I find it funny how Kurtis picked two very odd movies to review. As the comment section rightfully argues, Barbie in Princess and the Pauper is the ultimate superior movie. I don't know why he didn't chose that one, honestly. Then for Bratz, Fashion Pixiez is also a weird choice. I feel like Rock Angelz or Forever Diamondz would've been a good equal to Barbie in Princess and the Pauper.
Remember when Kurtis didn't have a mustache :) Edit: HIS NAILS!!! Kurtis is a lil e-boy
Barbie wins. I haven't watched yet. But Barbie wins
its summer and kurtis decides to bring out mech that are sweaters and sweats- lmao
i can’t believe you’ve done this to us again, i’m so disappointed
every fucking time kurtis put barbie saying Balls in the video i fucking lost it
I feel betrayed, I feel hurt. How DARE I not get my extra greeting. What kind of town is this!? #CancelKurtis2021
This is sus, no comment talking about how he chose not to do an extra greeting 🦦
Conner contemplating his life choices after making a horrible joke is such a mood
I had the biggest, gayest crush on Lina as a kid. Her, and Emily from the Corpse Bride.
Holy crap the repunzel movie! I had forgotten about that. I freaking loved that movie as a kid
whats the point of even subscribing if I dont get the extra greeting? this is false advertising and I'm calling my lawyers
your best work 🙌🏻🤩
Gesundheit
18:43 full cover now 👨🏻🔫
Bratz was definitely a better doll but after watching ONE Barbie movie, I can proudly say they know how to make a movie that even if the plot sucks, the animation is entertaining enough so I’m giving them that award 🏆
This is a very really good video
2:54 Community?!
The second I saw Dylan, I paused and ran downstairs to find my Dylan Bratz doll with the motorcycle, leather jacket, and shoes with silver flames 😂
huge power play dogs are just pissing on gnomes
This video recalled the dark memory that i owned the rapunzel barbie doll 😅😂😂
barbie rapunzel was my fucking shit when i was i kid
ok that’s all good but please watch all the barbie movies now thanks
Kelly looks like a toe
Please review W.I.t.c.h. Or some other video in this category. Yu definitely updated my enjoyment by cracking jokes
I gotta be real... I still don't understand the plot of the Bratz movie
Into the Woods, the Broadway recording at least, has a great quick gag with that exact “how does rapunzel’s scalp not rip off” thing. Worth watching for more than that reason!
i love when kurtis cuts to the fake apology video and it’s edited to be on james charles account ahhaha
The Bratz Teens Sleepover Adventure is by FAR the most terrifying one
Barbie all the way
SO NO HEAD-WIG
Ya yooo da ba yo
I didn't know this is exactly what I needed. Thank you for this master piece Kurtis 💙
i had that blue bratz motorcycle. I might have had the dude too. god
wood chipper? I hardly know her
No second greating? UNSUBED
Idk y but during every dance sequence I keep picturing Barbie coming in and bitch slapping everybody
Shave your head
Yo, gotta compare with Monster High now.
so anyway,,, monster high.
bruh what did i do to you? 😭
Polly Pocket for life gang gang 💅
Yo fuckin Chalk Zone??? Hit me like whiplash
I loved the Bratz movies growing up so… hindsight 20-20
Kurtis the prince doesn't hang from her scalp- she's tied her hair around the pole of her window so that's where his weight is going, though it makes more sense in Disney's Tangled
i love wjen kurtis, danny, and scott all upload on the same day
Barbie is the best because it’s the movies I liked when I was a kid 😎
You should definitely look up for the brazillian's "Barbie" version, the doll Susi from Estrela. They even got her a boyfriend named Beto.  ✨amazing✨
oh hECK yes
How did I ever live without this video
All jokes aside I'm actually really upset about the no extra greeting
F*ck you Kurtis as a tax paying member of Kurtistown I Expect and Demand an extra greeting,   Im moving to Gus & Eddy City
something i didn’t know i needed: kurtis watching my favorite bratz movie
“if ur going to have a chase scene it can’t just be footsteps.” wrong best movie chase scene of all time harry potter deathly hallows pt one that shit slaps
I liked both barbie and bratz. i preferred playing with barbie dolls and i preferred the bratz movies and tv series
He literally roasted James Charles, and I cannot get over it.
If feel like the 'no one with a lying heart can leave the castle' plot point could've worked if Gothel was gaslighting Rapunzel into thinking she's a liar. Then, it'd be more emotionally resonant....maybe.
douth thou carpets match thy drapes
regardless which barbie movie bratz wouldve rained supreme their movies kill me
Barbie was made for little little kids like 3 to 7 and bratz dolls were for older kids, so I loved both equally, just at different points of my life!
I was obsessed with the Barbie repunzel movie as a kid but looking at the animation now makes me cringe
People get cancelled and choose not to learn from their mistakes
OMG DYLAN FROM BRATZ IS THE BLUEPRINT FOR TIKTOK EBOYS LMAO
You’re adopted.  YEE YEE       *o my god I just watched the part when they put on the glasses, and I realized that all water is gnome piss :0*
WHERE IS MY EXTRA GRETTING😭😡😤
*Ya hooo da ba yo*
Barbie might've won if he watched princess and the pauper  The songs in that movie slap  Also since Bratz won he could compare another Bratz movie to a Monster High movieand see if Mattel can redeem themselves
kurtis repeating "not a virgin" brought me back to the intro of dave the barbarian when the kid shouts "not a monkey!"
Brats had the better dolls, while Barbie’s movies had better overall quality. But I will definitely say that Bratz Fashion Pixez is the best Bratz movie and my favorite childhood movie while the Princess and the Pauper is the best Barbie movie.
15:53 that's my boy levi from AOT
I watched the  pixie movie when i was little and this brought back so many memories  i repressed lmfao
My mom didn’t let me watch bratz or play with them but I had few and I watched the sleepover movie. But I’m definitely a Barbie/Polly pocket/lego raised child
#cancelkurtis Love u kurtis
Those moms that were pissed about Bratz would have an aneurysm if they’ve heard of LOL Dollz
Those kids from the Barbie movie are haunting
GIVE HIM TO ME EUGHHH
Love how Kurtis is getting more comfortable and developing his videos to be better more and more each time. Absolute King
it feels weird that kurtis didn’t do the extra greeting
ya hooo da ba yo
Dude Fashion Pixiez is my favorite Bratz movie
Love this but I should have been Princess and the Pauper vs. the live Bratz movie - IE the two best movies of all time
i'd just like to point out that i didn't see a single person of color in the barbie movie... that's all.
Ya hooo da ba yo 😏🔥
kurtis, im lost for words. WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU NOT DO THE EXTRA GREETING!?!
cancel kurtis.
Weasel
The Barbie one is like the bastard love child of Tangled and Dragon Tales lmao
"mattel me that" i choked!!! 😂😂
god i need ten of this same video with different barbie and bratz movies
dislike for the lack of extra greeting. ON PRIDE MONTH KURTIS?!
bratz for fucking life but barbie repunzel slapped
I totally though the Wiesel was hella weird too tbh haha
Kurtis town giving me the mental break I needed from my in-laws.  Thank you, Mayor Mustache Mullet.
“Kelly looks like a goddamn nightmare “  Ooooh I just flashed back to middle school 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️💀💀
MATTEL ME THAT
Barbies with a butthole... already exist - PH
-cody's voice- frickin VIRG
I don’t even want to admit the extent of my laughter when I watched this (11:05)
Ever After High vs Monster High
Everyone is saying he should've watched the Princess and the pauper or the diamond castle, but y'all really forgetting about the most hilarious one of them all, a fairy secret.
barbie and the 12 dancing princesses is the best barbie movie
both of these movies were like not the best out of these franchises. u should of asked me 🤚
more
KURTIS THAT IS MY EXTRA GREATING YOU ARE NOT DELIVERING WHAT YPU PROMISED
Glad that Kurtis likes Arctic monkeys
not the best bratz movie vs one of the worst barbie ones
Where did you leave the myscenes???? :'(
woah... no extra greeting... what’s the point of being subscribed then... idk man... rude...
no Wilhelm scream even when the king is named Wilhelm i feel robbed
the conclusion  bratz>>>barbie (except for that horny weasel)
boy you better  make a bracket and add in myscene dolls next
I needed this video so much
unsubscribing until I get an extra greeting. this was a scam.
He made this for me. I just know it.
Why no extra greeting WHAT WAS THE REASON!!
A video about barbie movies seems dirty without Aaron and Jo.
Oh. My. God. That barbie movie has brought back memories I didn't even know I still had!!!! That weasel tho...😂
virgin really good
Fun Fact: The reason why monster high dolls changed and the company declined is because many parents mad because of the proportions and that they were monsters. The reason they declined was they had some legal issues with Disney from a pier contract I believe. Watch the video "what happened to Monster High?" By NegativeLegend.
My ferrets don't make any of those weird weasel noises...
ya hooo da ba yo
i usually wouldn't tolerate any barbie movies slander, but i'll let it pass this time just bc i choked on my lunch laughing
0:35 guess there is no more reason to subscribe then.. 😤😔
Ad ends. Kurtis: Alright back to it. Love his timing.
Hated bratz lol LOVED Myscene dolls! I also love how Barbie has become more inclusive over the years. From different skin tones (even vitiligo) to different body types and barbies with disabilities.
Gesundheit
Kurtis is starting to look like my dad
Barbie is superior why is this even a fight 😂
“Dost thows carpet match thys drapes?” 😂😂
I’m disliking the video in retaliation for not getting the extra greeting that I’m entitled to
Kurty that is a whole part in the barbie movie about why that lil dragon can't fly 😭🤣 love you.
The ocarina tune I noticed
corona warning! 28:47
Honestly the modern Barbie series really slaps
Also this took me back to my childhood. I prefered bratz but rapunzel was my favourite barbie movie
I couldn’t stop laughing at the Bratz clips my GOD
Where’s my monster high doll peeps at ✋🥰
30 seconds in and im DOUBLE OFFENDED. the virgin joke… AND NO EXTRA GREETING!! Fuck you!Unsubbing.
My little sisters don't even use neither, they use those gross LOL dolls
You should see studio c's video on rapunzel, I think you'd like it because it does cover the whole hair supporting weight thing
Kelly really just kept taking blows in this video “she looks like what stubbing your toe feels like” lmfao
I needed this content kurtis conner. I needed it.
The gnome is irish and "cailinis" means girls and he basically saying; your not wanted here,your mother wouldnt like it LMAO from what i could get anways
is that... a gametheory achievement logo....
Sorry whats going on with the 70's porno moustache 😂
omg i’m so sad he didn’t review bratz forever diamonds. seriously the most chaotic movie i think i’ve ever seen
looks like what stubbing your toe feels like, looooooooooool
Next you should check out the My Scene dolls movie with LINDSAY LOHAN
I saw both of those movies, and even I loved the bratz movie more mostly cuz the dark pixiez song
I got a doll ad before this
barbie as rapunzel slaps SO hard but this commentary is the funniest fucking thing i've ever heard  edit: KURTIS YOU LITTLE BITCH, PENELOPE IS AFRAID OF HEIGHTS
ya hooo da ba yo
I’m tempted not to watch the whole video just because of our lack of extra greeting. Is this your way of proving to us you aren’t a virgin? By being a douche? Well it works because no virgin would treat me this way. Good riddance. #kurtisisoverpart2
Bruhh me and my mom always HATED that weasel!!! Freaky rat bastard… 😒😤
Why does kurtis look like American lazarbeam
Kurty boy I'm sending you to jail with Alex Turner and every other Arctic Monkeys fan in the entire world
Barbie is superior in every sense and way possible. The movies made my childhood
We all know this was just an excuse for Kurtis to watch these movies.
Not giving an extra greeting sounds like something a VIRGIN says]
Consider voting 3rd party: Monster High
ya hooo da ba yo
Okay but why did bratz dolls cost like 3x more than barbie dolls? Cause every rich kid made me feel bad about not affording them
Why didn't you review Princess and the Pauper >:(
lmao the barbie chase scene reminds me of the without music videos with the shoe clapping
virgin podcast
ya hooo da ba yo
honestly i just fucking love you atleast your videos and the way you portrait yourself in these so that means i just fucking love you that is the best comment i ever wrote
VRG= Very Really Gooby
you look like crystal methyd
Is Dylan related to Rolli Schmidt?
ehh o7
A sequel to this video but with subscriber recommended movies ? 👉👈
Barbie as Rapunzel was one of my “watch on repeat” movies as a kid! Clicked so fast to watch you roast one of my childhood favourites 🤣
I came here to say that I think Kurtis, is indeed, a vrg
You did a dad sneeze, that mustache is starting to take hold.
Loved the Arctic monkeys reference. Never really heard them be talked about online. Didn't realise they were really known in Canada
Ya hoo da ba yo
i can’t believe he picked my two favorites from each
no pressure for an extra greeting kurtis i hope u make content that empowers u!!
The plot of the bratz's movie is pretty similar to another barbie movie called a fairy secret so yeah... you should watch it. Anyways, great video dude. Love ya <3
ya hooo da ba yo
Kurtis: Barbie vs. Bratz  My 2000s-2010s childhood: *oh lets go*
You could have watched Princess and the pauper and chose barbie as rapunzel...
very really gay
Barbie swan lake has the funniest antagonists. The daughters laugh is just so funny . The animals that turn into humans but you can still tell what animal they are cause of clothes
"can a *virgin* have a podcast?" bro i thought you were american
dear diary: today i found out theres a bratz doll i share a name with and apparently i got named after it???  crazy day
bro you picked like the most boring barbie movie imaginable
Dylan really is a tiktok kid just dancing the whole time all this drama is happening
I like to just sit back and observe the barbie vs bratz thing because I grew up with monster high dolls and movies
unfollowing bc i didnt get my greeting
Anyone know the outro song
I guess we're going to have to make  #kurtisconnerisoverparty trending again..
Tbh really fun video bc Barbie as rapunzel is one of my chilhood movies, kinda pissed you didn't choose the Princess and the Pauper lol
Please shave I’m sorry
WHERES MY EXTRA GREETING
is the dancing thing like...a take on fairy circles??
So Barbie having weird side characters the funniest movie is Barbie island princess cause prince azul and making fun of tika cause on the dvd box she had eyebrows and in the movie she doesn’t have eyebrows. For storyline gotta say four musketeers. But just for making funny videos I’d say fairy secret cause it’s just so ridiculous and at the end they all think it’s a dream. Yeah
Okay, but I think we can all agree that the Bratz sleepover movie was literally the most terrifying thing in existence
#cancelkurtis
Doth thy curtains match thy drapes 😌💅🏻
Can we talk about, that the most important object in the Barbie-Mermaid-Movie looks like a Popstacle? Like.. people writting those  BarbieMovies, are you ok??
WIATTTT I FUCKING REMEMBER THIS RAPUNZEL MOVIE!! it only clicked when the hairbrush turned into a paint brush that i saw this when i was like. 7 idk
Kurtis you got a nair add on your video
Why does bald Kurtis looks like he was a divorced dad in a race car movie, and tried to win back the love of his son by giving his son the car, that he loved more than his ex-wife, so he can win the race. Only for his son to not only lose the car race, but also explode the car before the race even started. Yet some how, some way, his son loved him again and he was dating his ex-wife again.
simberween is what we call halloween in the sims community call halloween so i was very confused
"Mattel me that"...lmao i lost my shit my sense of humour is cracked
No second greeting? Character development?
#KurtisConnerIsOverParty
i had both dolls and i thought they were friends idk whats goin on
Kurtis shoulda watched Barbie in The Nutcracker, that movie is a 10/10
"Doth thou carpet match thy drapes?"
Barbie vs Bratz  The winner is Monster High
Kurtis Rapunzel vs Fashion Pixies is NOT a fair match-up, Fashion Pixies is the easy winner. You should've put it against a better/more iconic movie like Fairytopia, Swan Lake, Princess and the Pauper, or Magic of Pegasus. I demand a round 2 with 2 different movies of a similar caliber/popularity.
This is the funniest video you've made, hands down. Well done
oh my god its fucking kelly
What’s the point of being subscribed without the extra greeting? 🥲
you need to do this again i couldn't stop laughing
hold on.. I think we all need to pause and take this masterpiece in.. 😳
Kurtis is definitely a virgin
Boooo Barbie is better!!! You picked the worst Barbie movie ever!
no extra greeting bad
Well if I'm not getting an extra greeting I might as well leave Kurtis town
Nooo he should've used barbie fairy secret 😭
Idk, I’d be pretty stoked to not be a tree after ten years. The following days of adjustment to my former life will be filled with enough depression, exhaustion and ptsd.
lmao the silent chase scene-
Please talk about monster high and ever after high, amaiznf
In the Brazilian dub of Barbie Rapunzel movie, the weasel says "pega ele, frita ele, faz purê" and it is the most beautiful thing the universe has ever created.
Part 2 with Princess and the Pauper and Bratz: Rock Angelz???? I BEG
Kurtis: I. AM. NOT. A. VIRGIN. Also Kurtis: has a mullet
ya hooo da ba yo
I’m in animation and I have been waiting for this video 😍😍
barbie remains superior
18:59 THE SUBTLE WOMP WOMP WOMP IN THE BACK IS TAKING ME *OUT*
Are we just gonna ignore the sound of Stephan climbing rapunzels hair…
Thank goodness, I’ve been wondering Kurtis’s thoughts on Barbie dolls and Bratz
I love that the extra greeting is done. It was cute but I started to hate it.
“Doth thou carpets match thy drapes”   I CANNOT AHHHHHHHHHH HOLY FUCK HAHAHAHSHKCJSJS best joke in the fucking video
hi hello...please restock "be nice to me it's the law" i want 50
I thought both of this movies were feverdreams of mine
ya hooo da ba yo
this is such a chaotic video. especially the intro
the barbie movies were fucking amazing I will die on that hill
man now i'm mad that my mom only let me watch barbie movies as a kid.  I watched all those movies FOR WHAT.
I watched barbie as rupanzel as a kid
the extra greeting keep me alive,,please i need them 🙂🙂
Please remake this video but reviewing the Princess and the Pauper
Kurtis Cena, can we see you in bratz clothes
Ba l l s
Brats had a video game to
Yeah for like 6 months straight on every Danny,drew, and kurtis video of comment “please react to Barbie island princess or Barbie fairy secret” cause those two are funnier
give him to meeee ✨ughh ✨😩
If there's one thing the whole comments agree on its that princess and the pauper was the best barbie movie
remove the mustache kurits
my mom used to say that brats were hoochie mommas so i never had any :(
kurtis you are a cool cat
Bratz was ELITE
I JUMPED OUT OF MY SEAT WHEN THE GNOME STARTED SPEAKING IN IRISH SLANG IM HOWLING SM
Chipper? I hardly know her
Dude this video just made my day - those two of my favourite childhood movies and you just made them so much better. I was crying from laughing so hard
Those are some Very Really Good letters
this video has no right to be as amazing as it is
DO BARBIE AND THE MAGIC PEGASUS😩😩😩
you look like jesse pinkman when your bald
Nothing scarier then an angry little Irish gnome
Vrg? More like very really virgin
I can agree that that specific bratz movie is better than that specific Barbie movie. Cause of the Barbie renaissance era out of those 4 rapunzel is the worst.
I had bratz dollz and didn’t like Barbie dolls
aha yea nice video but can someone give me bratz movies recs?
is it really worth subscribing? i might unsubscribe, i didnt get an extra greeting in the beginning of this video, im very disappointed
I personally.... like monster high dolls 😳😳😳
scrolltum
2:53 when I saw this I thought of the Greendale flag from community.
I was literally just talking about Small Soldiers.
Kurtis if you ever do a video on the bratz movie you should watch the bratz super babyz or slumber party
I never realized the animation on these was so dreadful ahaha
I thought the Bratz movie was a fever dream I had
barbie and the 12 dancing princesses watching this like 🧍🏽‍♀️
My favorite barbie model is the Trixie. It's pretty recent, but it has really unique paint and comes with great wigs. Plus the wardrobe is poppin' if you are into mod stuff lmao
Kurtis u picked a bad Barbie movie to compare….. fairytopia or 12 dancing princesses r wayyyy better
My personal favorite Barbie movies were Barbie and the twelve dancing princesses, swan lake and the nut cracker!
You have to watch the best of the best for it to be fair!
It's just now occurring to me that Bratz aesthetic really is the current trend among young people.
As someone who obsessed over bratz i think im allowed to say Drew and Danny are the twins with the nose bandages and Kurtis is the mom.
You need to watch princess and the pauper and Bratz kidz sleepover adventure right now
Rapunzel is one of the great Barbie movies. Thank you, Curtis♥️
Breanna’s mom turning into a tree is an AOT reference
Okay but can we get a Barbie & the three musketeers vs The uh one where they went to france as spies-  I just think they are both top-tired movies and whoever disagrees I think you might be  w r o n g
wow...worlds collide!
EARLYYYYYHYYY
Omfg the Barbie movie dug up some mems I completely forgot about
barbie the princess and the pauper movie (and dolls) outranks any bratz movie and you can’t tell me otherwise
I'm unsubscribing give me my extra greeting or I will fight
I gotta say, I grew up on both bratz and Barbie and at the time, yes I preferred barbies but now that I’m older, if I had to pick, I would 100% pick bratz and I’m disappointed in my younger self that I didn’t have better taste
out of every barbie movie you chose that one...............
Missing my bratz collection now 🤘
I feel like Kurtis is slowly being replaced by a guy who is possibly his much older uncle, who is definitely not a virgin
#cancelKurtisConnerthevirgin for purposely not giving us our Extra Greeting
This isn’t Danny Gonzalez, it’s better
i used to collect barbie movies when i was little and i must say you chose the WORST one. this one didnt even have any of the homoerotic subtext that exists in almost every barbie movie
NO BECAUSE WHY IS THE GNOME IRISH AND WHY DID HE SAY CAILÍNÍ (which means girls btw)
Kurtis the reason why Rapunzel didn't leave on Penelope's back is because Penelope is scared of heights!! That's her whole character arc!!
How did you literally pick the worst 2 movies😂😂
not the Kelly slander
man all these years later there is still something about the way the hair in the Bratz movies is animated that I really like. it's just so nice to look at
smh Kurtis has NO taste. Clearly he hasn’t seen the MASTERPIECE called “Barbie life in the dream house” 🙄🤚 /j
I’ve never clicked so fast
i’m literally LIVID that he didn’t talk about Bratz rock angels????? ITS THE BEST ONE
Barbie as Rapunzel looks like it was filmed entirely in sims 2
Anyone remember the Bratz Boyz?! I had the Punkz Eitan and I had a crush on it 😂
Bratz was so popular because of the diversity and the fashion. For Barbie, you could really only find really good pieces for Barbie, and even then, Bratz did far better in really keeping up with the fashion trends. But it is so funny that Bratz were called "sluts" when people have spent years calling Barbie plastic and unrealistic and sexualized and it's like... Pick a side?? But anyway neither of them are sexual. And for my two cents, Bratz was the better doll line in the Y2K, while Barbie had the better movies. (I can't believe you didn't watch Princess and the Pauper??!!) Now, Barbie's movies are kind of middling to okay, but their dolls have gotten a lot more inclusive and fashionable.
how dare you Kurtis. you chose the worst barbie movie there is. fairytopia supremacy. I may just move out of kurtistown after this. balls
very really good? i hardly know her!!
That is the second time you have failed us Kurtis, if we're deprived of yet another extra greeting I Will be forced to take drastic measures and spell your name with a C.
ya hooo da ba yo🤠
19:34 Dylan twerking is the funniest shit😂🏴‍☠️
as a kurtis town resident. i am personally hurt, it is really disrespectful to not give an extra greeting. shame on you. 😡
LMAOO I had the barbie Rapunzel computer game and ngl it was kinda lit growing up
him saying the brats fits go hard made my day
BRUH BARBIE RAPUNZEL WAS MY SHITTT WHEN I WAS LITTLE
18:17 Wow it's really nice to see accurate irish representation in the films 😍
I grew up with Barbie as Repunzel, I have a such soft spot for the movie . I always wanted that magic paintbrush
CMON KURTIS, shoulda watched barbie swan lake :///
Oh my gosh that gnome's irish accent was so cringe!! Did he actually call them cailíní??
Hey kurtis I loved the vid! And yes I did laugh, thank you <3
I really did laugh too much at the "do i wanna gnome" joke
Excellent video as always, but I have to disagree, Barbie movies are unmatched, just the sight of that purple dragon made me want to cry with nostalgia
Yooooo our mayors hair is looking perfectly fresh rn!!!!!
Monster High and Ever After High
“You look like what stubbing your toe feels like” is such a powerful insult
Kurtis looks high when he says " are they saying that all fire hydrants are just little garden gnomes in disguise?"
I see a lot of people in the comments who are sad he didn't pick a better barbie movie.... I am with y'all!!!!! He probably did it for the memeable weasel
I'm very sad that I didn't get an extra greeting 😞
preminger. that's all i'm gonna say
Hedwig is actually female
Yeah that gnome used to always scare me.. I think it’s just it’s face
Chalkzone has a rapunzel episode I was think about a few minutes before you mentioned chalkzone
When he said  "we're only half way done guys" It was actually in the middle of the video lol     It was on minute 14:30
how dare you? :C
8:21 KURTIS I WAS NOT READY
DYLAN WALKED SO EBOYS COULD RUN THEIR FINGERS THROUGH THEIR HAIR 💀💀💀💀💀💀
usually i liked more bratz movies as a kid but the princess and the pauper barbie movie HITS
ya hoooo da ba yo
Who knew Gothel got invited to all these      BALLS
the best Barbie movie is Princess and the Popper for sure
Hardest ive lqughed in ages i thank thee
✨do I wanna gnome✨
Otto alone gets Barbie the win!
Chalk Zone.. thank you for unlocking that memory from my brain
Why did Stephan GRIP her body like that…with his whole hand
Should definitely watch two of the newer movies, and redo, lol. I loved Barbie and the 3 musketeers, and Barbie Princess Charm School.
Kurtis you literally picked the worst movies
chalk zone is how i learned the word "bucko" & i'm forever grateful
Why does moustache Kurtis remind me of the weasel???
My childhood Barbie heart is hurting right now😮‍💨👑
#kurtisconneriscancelled can’t believe you’d PURPOSEFULLY not put in an extra greeting…
#cancelkurtisconner
"Kelly is a goddamn nightmare to look at"  *My name being Kelly* :😯
kurtis i unsub, no extra greetings = no sub
Myscene movies trump all of them!!!!!!!!
This video is SERIOUSLY and DANGEROUSLY intense 😩
THE FUCKING WEASEL VIDEO COMES FROM THIS MOVIE HOLY SHIT
Kurt I miss the old you I miss when you did extra greetings 😢🥺
this video feels so unhinged in comparison to the others for some reason
kurtis diserves unsub
Am I dumb or did you grow a mullet six minutes into the video?
“Matel me that” is the comedy gold that keeps me here.
We need a part two with Monster High
Honestly terrifying gnomes are a reoccurring theme in Bratz movies. I'm not making this up.
Let's face it, the only reason Kurtis chose Barbie as Rapunzel was because of the weasel
barbie as rapunzel is easily one of the worst barbie movies just saying
4/10 Did not get my extra greeting, would not watch again
Monster High is for all the goth and emo teens back then.
you forgot monster high that was my shit
ya hooo da ba yo
Okay now do the super Mario brothers super show
This I was my favorite Barbie movie as a kid and I 100% loved watching Kurtis make fun of it
nevermind. it’s the arctic monkeys reference for me. that’s it that’s the comment 😂
FINALLY, some good fucking FOOD
YAHOOOOYAMMAGNOE!!!
the “i didn’t mean it im desperate” for the apology was a POWER MOVE
I never clicked on a Kurtis video this fast hahaha I loved both dolls!
why does gothel look like a roblox character
I would replay the dark pixie club scene on repeat when I was younger, that song actually had crack in it
this video screwed up my ads its all toys and sht now
I liked the Bratz dolls better as a kid, because Barbie dolls were usually more expensive and had less accessories. HOWEVER Barbie will still always be superior in regards to the movies. The Bratz movies never kept my ADHD ridden child brain entertained, but on the other hand, there wasn't a single Barbie movie that I didn't absolutely adore. I watched those movies on repeat, especially Princess and The Pauper. I still love Barbie movies, even as a 19 year old, because they're just so nostalgic. The newer ones have been pretty bad lately, but the old ones are absolutely stunning, and still hold up today. I also like Barbie's personality/persona more than the Bratz girl's; the Bratz had sassy and relatable type personas, while Barbie had more of a graceful role model persona. This is all just my opinion, so Bratz fans please don't get mad at me, coz I still love Bratz, despite my obvious biases towards Barbie.  But fr, can we talk about the Monster High and Tinker Bell movies? So underrated smh.
If you held the hair stable somewhere at the top, physics will take over and stop any force from reaching your head
Fun Fact: the first barbie couldn't stand alone
he seems really on edge :(
11:20 pls why is no one talking abt this masterpiece
this is the video i've been waiting for my entire life
The fact I saw the ***hole picture kurtis used and thought it was the greendale flag... iykyk
now that kurtis has watched a barbie movie, it’s clear he needs to do a collab with aaron and jo
you cant choose a barbie movie and not choose fairytopia… what is going on!!!!
Bratz will always be superior to me
these movies just came so fast and so deep from my subconscious hoooooooly shit
you picked the best bratz movie but you didn’t pick barbie princess and the pauper…… you missed the masterpiece
If I had to choose between Barbie and Bratz, I'm gonna stick with Barbie.
I WANT MY EXTRA GREETING IM IN KURTISTOWN FOR A REASON
Now we need Bratz vs Monster High
Kurtis I am begging you to watch barbie princess and the pauper
So… all that the evil pixies do in the bratz movie is make people dance?
We can all agree though.. Barbie movies are ICONIC
I personally DEMAND a part 2 to this video
Chalkzone 💯🔥🥵
why would i actually buy barbied wire
I got huge virgin vibes from this video ngl
I never watched the Bratz movies, but I had a DS game. Pretty sure it still works. Barbie movies tho. I still have the DVDs
why do i feel like this video is 5 times better then all your other videos? it's like you kinda changed the way you present the script. i like it.
Hedwig is a girl you muggle!
How dare you not give me my extra greeting
28:45
Whats the point of subbing if I dont get another greeting
Barbie and the Diamond Castle slaps so hard
y yo pensando que era "verga":c
I just realized he has black fingernails-  he’s rocking them though
I laughed SO much about this. Thank you!
The bi energy is strong with this one
I subscribed for an extra greeting god dammit
Educate yourself kurtis, those were alicorns! 💜🏳️‍🌈
cancelled
All the butthurt barbie fans in the comments. Stay mad 😌💅 Kurtis is a bratz boi
D@#k move man you lied to us you promise an extra greeting every video . Why haveI been subscribed for over a year? I will tell you why for the EXTRA  GREETING !!!!!!!!!!!  really uncool move.!!!!!!
Ya hooo da ba yo
the barbie rapunzel slander in this comment section 💀💀
HEDWIG IS A GIRL KURTIS
why do all the evil step mothers and queens and stuff always have weasels in barbie movies
Barbie vs bratz vs monster high 😏
damn i used to love bratz sooo much now looking back at it ......yikszsz
Kurtis better not be moving away from his extra greetings 😡😡😡  In all honesty though this video was hilarious
This shit activated my fight or flight system and I wanted to throw hands in defense of my entire childhood.. before clicking the video lmao
The amount of perfect puns in this video. I love it here in Kurtistown
okay virgin
ya hooo da ba yo
Bro i remember watching the Barbie movie... Thought it was better when i was young
not kurtis giving a summary of Barbie as Repunzle like I didn’t watch that movie 24/7 as a kid 😌😌
I haven’t watched the full video yet but the answer is BRATZ
fashion pixies is hands down one the best bratz movies😫👌
My mom wouldn't let us have brats dolls because she didn't like the extra makeup they had. We mostly had stuffed animals
Omg! The "holding my self accountable" video😂
To anyone saying princess in the pauper is the best Barbie movie: fight me, rapunzle was by FAR better. I will die on this hill.
The Barbie movie looks like it was filmed in RuneScape
The amount of kurtis dancing in this video is now the standard for all future videos! Love it thank you kurtis, this will make up for the lack of extra greeting I got today🥰
KURTIS I COME FOR YOUR EXTRA GREETING, WHERES MY EXTRA GREETING-
No extra greeting, huh? Trying to assert some sort of control, huh? Well watch this: unliked, un-belled, unsubscribed, unfollowed, UNACCEPTABLE. How's that for control?
I AM CONSTANTLY RAVING ABOUT THAT BRATZ MOVIE FASHION PIXIEZ OMFG I LOVE THAT MOVIE
I’m pretty sure I used to have a crush on all of the pixies. Mostly Lena
This is all I've ever needed
#Kurtisconnerisoverparty 😭🤚
the superior barbie movie is actually barbie and the twelve dancing princesses !! dont even try to fight me on this also the best bratz movie is definitely bratz: rock angelz the songs on that album r still so good
idk kurtis, not doing the extra greeting is a very virgin move :/
12/10 made me laugh out loud
ok but monster high vs barbie
His mustash is looking like the Post Malone kissing dog one
I liked then unliked to like again after knowing Kelly will fall into the abyss if I liked the video 😎 thanks kurtis 👍
How can you be scared by Kelly but not by those background characters on the pixiez movie?????
I like how defensive kurtis was at the beginning 😂 that was funny! He's so cute!!
Barbie: *Princess and the Pauper* vs Bratz: *Rock Angels* next 😌
This is bringing back SOOO many memories that we’re locked in the vault 😂😂love it
princess and the pauper is undoubtedly the best movie in the history of movies
bless you kurtis
SHUT UP BABE KURTIS JUST DROPPED
He should have watched a couple episodes of Barbie life in the dream house lmao
I see #kurtisisoverparty trending and it’s a gross accusation against him that’s being put up 😡. This is obviously his channel so the number of greetings he gives us is decided by him. Y’all should be grateful he was even GIVING you undeserving wenches his extra greetings. 😡 Canceling him saying you all were hoodwinked is … is blasphemy.
monster high dolls 😏 plz do a video on them, theyre so weird but I love them
How is literally no one talking about "so no Hedwig?"
bro actually fuck you for not giving me an extra greeting. I've never felt so betrayed.
This is my god damn childhood
He should’ve done princess Barbie school 🙄
All this work to do this video for absolutely nothing! Everybody knows that the best doll was MyScene!
GIVE HIM TO MEEEE, 😫
10:15 oh my god its noel miller!
Kurtis, this is your best video in a long time, and i only say that about once a month
Kurtis I am very offended that you purposely didn't give an extra greeting. One if the only reasons I subscribe to you us because if the extra greeting. Last time you forgot to say an extra greeting I was very close to unsubscribing to you.  But this might be the last straw , I must say you shouldn't be leaving out the extra greeting because it's one of the only things keeping me alive.  Literally every time u give an extra greeting it gives me oxygen. Your extra greeting is oxygen.  So if you miss one more greeting I will die. And I will report you to the police. In conclusion do not skip the extra greetings and the claps.
I was literally telling my friends how much cooler Bratz are than Barbie the other day. Then our fine mayor drops this BANGER of a video further proving my point! And he compared my two favorite movies from each doll line? STG livin' in the best timeline. Shout out to all my horny weasels out there!
This was such a chaotic and great video. One of my favourites. Good Job, Dude 👍
Give him to me *AAAAUUEEEGHHHH*   “You’re doing great Terry, keep going!”
Their twerking at the party is seriously intense
THE ARCTIC MONKEYS REFERENCE . THE KING LISTENS TO ARCTIC MONKEYS . I CAN NOW SLEEP IN PIECE  OMG
I've always been a Bratz stan because its diverse characters and the fact that the music slaps hard.       But I'll be honest, Barbie in the Nutcracker was a lowkey banger
I haven’t laughed this much in a while omg.
I need the rapunzel is bald now thing to be a song. Pwease Kuwtis?
I'm unsubscribing
I feel disrespected not getting the extra greeting
Kurtis this was a good review, but like ANY other Barbie movie would have been good! The fairy one was my favorite (literally cannot remember the name) but Barbie is a fairy and there's Bibble the blue guy?
My mom didn’t let me play with bratz dolls, and only because she didn’t like the name
Kurtis has big virgin energy
21:40 This party is seriously intense
21:58 😂😂
barbie swan lake awakened my love for classical music as a young child. i legit wonder if i would love it as much as i do now (or if i'd like it at all) if i didn't discover it through barbie back then!
Takis are seriously insane though
Wtf I thought my phone was acting up and broken well it is broken
As a child I had that Barbie movie on VHS and that weasel always freaked me out
all I’m saying is princess in the pauper slaps and you should have used that one 👀
Kurtis can you enable the subtitles please?
this is one of your funniest videos in a while i laughed so hard at all your jokes. even “do i wanna gnome”. but maybe i’m just tired <3
wow sigourney weaver was so good in that one barbie movie
You have to watch Barbie Mermaidia for Bibble and the weird goblin men
I've just discovered kurtis a week ago and since then I've watched everything back to 2018 and this is the first video I'm watching in 'real time' it's so weird hahaha
What an amazing, super great funny video! Love it! Exciting! Woah! [this comment was made for the algorithm]
WHERE IS MY EXTRA GREETING THIS IS A DEMOCRATIC TOWN OF KURT NOT A DICTATORSHIP!!!!!!!
By watching only one movie,  you missed the fact that every barbie movie has the same story line
I want Bratz to send you a PR package for their 2020 re-release 👀
What my daughter loved about the bratz dolls when they came out was that you could change their hair. They all had wigs that could be removed and changed to look completely different. That's a feature that Barbie never had
Why is nobody talking about this great he(a)dwig-joke?
Bruh I used to love Chalk Zone
Now THIS is the wholesome childhood content I needed today
I love your mustache
No more extra greetings? :(( I look forward to them all the timeeee
Kurtis are you okay?
i’m glad kurt doesn’t feel pressured to do the extra greeting anymore :) it was rly annoying when ppl kept reminding him about the one time he forgot jsbxjxn
the Bratz movie was made literally 5 yrs later than the Barbie movie, so knocking its animation is just unfair and the "Hot Fairy King Dad" has way more forehead than Kelly, plus the reason Kelly looks like that is because that's what Kelly dolls looked like in 2002
I did not expect this from Kurtis lmfao
BOTH BARBIES AND BRATZ ARE GOOD 🗣🗣   NVM... ILL SWITCH UP CAUSE BRATZ ARE JUST #1
kurtis never misses
alternative title: kurtis conner a bratz stan??
I……I thought it meant Virgo 😦
Barbie princess and the pauper was so good
I laughed so many times, great video, I’m only half way through
PLS WATCH THE BRATZ LIVE ACTION MOVIE PLEASE KURTIS
yo, i think about the hair thing all the time too
I'm glad Kurtis is doing what he wants regardless if we like it or not  it's his channel, and the videos yeah, pay his bills, but they are for fun   like others have said, it's obvious the extra greeting thing was annoying to him in some way  I feel like you can tell he's stressed, well and he says it in his podcast  but you can see it in the video. nothing negative or off putting, but ah, I know how to explain it  his vibes are off lol  no but fr, I hope he knows that ppl will still watch his videos no matter what he does. I dont know what it's like to be a youtuber, but hopefully he's able to figure out how to take time off  or set up a club or something so ppl can just donate to help offset a week without a video or something idk
I think the real bratz movie were the friends we made along the way
you're starting to look like an 80s karate instructor named Kent who sleeps with all the moms but lives in his Freedom Van.
*ya hooo da ba yo*
Kelly is a fetus with hair and clothes
KURDISSS you need to watch Bratz Rock Angels and Barbie Princess & the Pauper cmon now
lmfaooo i grew up watching both barbie and bratz movie
Who was actually thinking this handsome bastard was a virgin? Projecting, guys!
Can’t wait until next video where Curtis has to make an apology after getting canceled for calling alicorns “flying unicorns”
Alright Kurtis time for another apology video. You really didn't use Princess and the Pauper, the definitive Best Barbie Movie?? possibly unforgivable
goddamn it kurtis quit dropping bangers after bangers
Please see the Bratz fairy tale movie
Still prefer Monster High.
Kurtis: *rants about how Barbie provides unrealistic standards of beauty* Also Kurtis whenever a character has a larger than average forehead that a lot of people have: ☹️🤮
Where is the extra greeting?!?! WHERE IS IT KURTIS!!!
Man I just like bread
ya hooo da ba yo
7:44 I love the Xbox 360 achievement pop-up
Princess and the pauper is OP, I (respectfully) demand a follow up vid
ya hooo da ba yo
i saw someone comment in a previous video about how kurtis looks "tired" of doing the extra greeting... well... they were right..
Kurtis has to be *put in his place*
Barbie and thee 12 Dancing Princesses definitely would have won 😐
That gnome scene made me caCKLE also he said "cailíní" which is Gaeilge (Irish Language) for "girls"
Fun fact: the brazilian dub of that demonic weazel is actually pretty good. Just search "Pega ele, mata ele, faz pure", you not gonna regret it
my parents never let me play with bratz :(
"Could a virgin have a podcast?" ...Maybe... but a person with that mustache could be a virgin.
how how could u do this to me kurtism im unsubing ,only reason i sub is ffor the one more greeting u did not even do  the first greeting for the noobs who did not sub why WHY WHYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!   JK LOL
i think that you should have watched princess and the pauper, diamond castle, or mermaid tale 2, because they're all really good. they're also the gayest.
why does kelly look like syd from toy story
KURTIS please watch Barbie life in the Dreamhouse, on god it’s so good
kurtis are you off your adhd meds again
Barbie is superior to brats. That’s all I have to say. Monster high however…
WHAT WHY WOULD YOU DO NO EXTRA GREETING, AND ON PURPOUSE TOO?!? YOU ARE SICK OUT OF YOUR MIND I'M THIS CLOSE TO UNSUBBING!!!!1111!!!!!11!!! 1
I've seen this Barbie movie when I was a kid apparently. You didn't have to remind me...
My sister used to watch barbie movies all the time so i’m very familiar with barbie movies bratz not so much
the fact that you chose this bratz film is wild but im so glad you brought this back into my memory, but PLEASE, react to Bratz Rock Angels
I’m disowning you for dissing Barbie like that
No extra greeting. I'm sad now.
I checked yesterday for a new video lmao, I was like “it’s nearly time for fresh Kurtis I can feel it.” And here we are
look, i love barbie AND bratz, but monster high made THE BEST movies
Ngl, rapunzel wasn’t the best one. 12 dancing princesses and princess and the pauper are some of the best. Fairytopia is also a great trilogy, one to rival LOTR
Okay but hear me out, the extra greeting is not actually an extra greeting. The first greeting is greeting those who are new to the channel and the "extra greeting" is a greeting for those who aren't new and are subscribed members of KurtisTown. With that in mind, it would mean that both greetings are for two different groups of people and would not be an 'extra' greeting for the subscribed member
scrotum scrolls? nooooo
the evil pixies are just.... goth?
those are not flying unicorns.............they are pegasus........................................................
I'm sorry Kurtis...but the moustache needs to go.
I would've loved for you to watch Bratz Rock Angelz, it was my favorite movie growing up and is a classic. Thank you for another video yeeyee
KURTIS DONT ACT LIKE THE ONLY REASON U PICKED THAT BARBIE MOVIE WAS FOR THE ONE CLIP WHERE THE WEASEL WENT "give him to me uMGGh" LMAOO
Those ball scrolls are all from the weasel
barbie movies are so much better!
That party is just a sixty minute remix of Lieblingsfach, the song of that creepy German learning animation
Princess Charm school and Fashion pixies are my favorite of both simply because all of the outfits looked really damn good
I remember watching fashion pixiez years ago, yet I dont remember a single thing from this review
I HAVE to dislike because of Kurtis didn’t bother to greet us!
Thank u for not doing le intro, I was getting le annoying 🥺🥺🥺. Anyways u look like a Persian strip club over from Utah 😎😎😎
kurtis this is absolutely unacceptable. i expected an extra greeting but was let down. seriously. i am beyond upset by this.
bratz was my entire childhood fashion pixies was one of my favourites along with rock angels so this is actually ur most based video ever
What's the point of subscribing if i dont get an extra greeting?? Let alone one at least???
Penelope just learned how to fly by the end of the movie, that's why Rapunzel wasn't able to get out of the tower before
Shave it !!!!!!!!!!!
I mean, you have to admit the Barbie animation in 2002 looks good.
Kurtis didn't give us our extra greeting.
i wont take barbie rapunzel slander 😫😤
“Hey why stay on topic when you can simply not?” Kurtis describing my 24/7 mental state
That Rapunzel movie was my comfort movie when i was a little 😩
Us hearing the Ewwww from bratz for years now: 🙄😜🏳️‍🌈
Kurtis please watch barnyard 😩 I love trans icon Otis 😍‼️
no special greeting? unsubscribing rn smh
I take the fact that you had the option to watch any barbie movie and did not choose the princess and the pauper as a personal offense
Kurtis you don't know how fast i clicked the video when I saw the thumbnail and topic. This is my childhood. I used to have a CD that came with a bratz doll that had the song "cherry lips" by garbage on it and i played it constantly (bless my dad for putting up with it. Also listening to it now is.... Interesting) and i had like all the barbie movies on VHS
strange that in the video where he says hes not a virgin he doesnt do an extra greeting??
The only Bratz movie I saw, I can only remember this weird scene where the villain forced some water down the blonde girl’s throat. Like violently poured it into her mouth. And it was like water that turned her into an old lady, so she wouldn’t be able to stop the villain’s plans I think. Really weird, nightmarish but also kinky. I still thought about it a few times after. Maybe my mind is just making it up cos for me personally I just thought it was dark and screwed up as a kid? If someone else remembers, please comment
ya hooo da ba yo
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
as a virgin can confirm we cannot have podcasts
How dare you not greeting me twice?!😤
*Do I wanna gnome?* This is it. This is peak comedy.
NO FUCKING WAY!! LITERALLY YESTERDAY I WAS WATCHING BARBIE RAPUNZEL THINKING THE ANIMATIONS LOOKED SO MUCH LIKE GOAT STORY AND THAT U SHOULD DO A REVIEW! THIS IS TOO MUCH OF A COINCIDENCE WOW
No extra greeting?? Hitting unsubscribe right tf now, what's even the point now
what the fuck am i watching
bratz is better than barbie
Barbie as Repunzel is one of the MOST AWKWARD Barbie movies ever. Except for that one weird highschool thing- or the summer camp-
this guy is definitely a virgin if he said no extra greeting...
At first I thought it said VIRGO and you were blocking the O
Bratz dolls will always be better and no one can change my mind
Havent watched the video yet but I see Bratz Fashion Pixiez in the thumbnail and liked immediately since that’s my favorite movie of all time 🤩
Team bratz
ya hooo da ba yo
What about MyScene dollz. Their movies hit hardddddd
I just wanna say that I am in a bad place emotionally, and I am thankful that your videos are making my life a little more bearable. You have no idea how much I love your videos. I highly appreciate it, Kurtis. Thanks.
kurtis never disappoints
Love the mustache, Kurtis.
Look at the way he grabs her at 7:50.  Its so weird
Chipper? I hardly know her!
Monster High is better
I will defend Barbie as Rapunzel to the death because I had that movie on VHS and watched it religiously, so don't test me Kurtis!
Barbie dances: Huge balls and slow dances Bratz dances: Erratic movements attempting to summon Cthulhu
i am genuinely upset about the greeting :(
I loved the chasing scene in Barbie sm, it was no music just ASMR vibes.
These two things happen to be my childhood, and while those are valid criticisms, I'm obligated to hate you now
THE JAMES CHARLES SHADE OMG 💀💀
Bratz fashion pixiez is the best movie
kurtis if you ever watch another Bratz movie, even for VRG or something, PLEASE watch bratz: sleepover adventure. it's fucking wild it's like baby's first horror movie
Your commentary was as golden as Rapunzel's hair on the cover art.  I loved the bald skit and the "do I wanna gnome?" joke so much.   Please make more videos on the other movies because, man, they seem wild.    On another note, don't feel obligated to keep up the extra greeting joke if you rather not say it anymore.  It's your channel and you can do whatever you want, and I enjoy your content regardless.   Have a good one!
kurtis watch barbie island princess challenge
Yeah guys that says Virgin so he is a Virgin 🙄
Kurt I have unsubscribed since the only reason I had in the first place was for the extra greeting. You've fucked up and I cannot forgive you until you profusely apologize.
22:09 LISTEN, WHEN I TELL YOU I DIED AT THIS PART 😂😂😂
FINALLY. IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
Okay before even watching this I'm just gonna say Barbie. The Barbie films were and still are works of art.
alex turner has been real quiet since this video came out ‼️
the hair thing doesnt hurt bc of the way rapunzel loops it around a pillar a few times first, it puts all the tension on the pillar and her heads just chillin
I didn’t subscribe for no extra greeting. I just wanna be appreciated 🥲🤡
the sass in not doing the extra greeting I-
No special greeting ? then what did I subscribe for ? unsubscribing.
“So no head-wig” absolutely killed me
Ughh where's my extra greeting bestie?
He sees angry twerking... My mind went way dirtier. ... That looked like angry F word-ing.. maybe he'd recognize that if he wasn't a VIRGIN
It feels like Kurtis just wanted an excuse to watch a Barbie movie and a Bratz movie.      this is a joke
omg the Oirish garden gnome actually speaks a word of Irish?! Bratz wins.  (Why didn't you review Princess and the Pauper???)
In my opinion brats dolls are real life  👁👄👁
nightmare to look at ✌️
this is my favorite fucking video. bratz 4 life
I was obsessed with that pixie movie as a kid
The Scrotum Scrolls III: Morrodick
I saw the title and my respect for this man escalated higher then I ever thought it could!
It actually wouldn't hurt Rapunzel. MatPat did a film theory on this
Lmfaoooo "looks like what stubbing your toes feels like" BAHAHAJA
Why is there an Irish gnome in the bratz movie
*"sO nO hEdWiG?"*
The puns in this are seriously intense. Favourite video after goat story
I’ve never noticed before but your sharp teeth on the bottom are very pointy and a lil distracting. Kinda jealous ngl 🤙
This video is just anti-Barbie slander smh
this vid rocks a lot thanks man
There are so many awesome Barbie movies and you choose one of the bad ones :(
I agree Kurtis I really do
Ayyyye, Bratz ftw!!! As it should and as it should always be!!!
is kurtis ok
ya hooo da ba yo awooga kurtis
The bratz movie gives off "Hallo aus Berlin" energy.
this is a niche genre I'm very glad you're addressing
Angry twerk got me
Your videos never fail to make me laugh. Stellar work yet again my guy.
The girlz with the passion 4 fashion have won once again
She just needs to tie her hard around something sturdy so the weight of the dude Is not pushed on her neck.
holy shit i had that barbie movie on vhs and i used to rewatch it ever night before bed im having flashbacks
When the first vid of his I dislike is one where he purposefully doesn't gimme the extra greeting I suBscRiBeD for lmfao
The bratz movies will always win. My favorite one the the bratz go to Paris they're spies and everything 10/10
Watching this while eating Takis
He's hard in the recording booth? That's what you get for hiring Vic Mignogna
this is the best vid you've ever done
That was a really really funny video
ya hooo da ba yo
shaming women into unrealistinc standarts? try shaming a toddler into not playing with "cOoL GiRlS" bc they didnt have a bratz doll..
Fellow conner here, hello bro
6:21 but with no context
why did it have to be Rapunzel out of ALL the Barbie movies 😫
ya hooo da ba yo
Bratz Girlz Really Rock is the best Bratz movie
No extra greeting?  *frantic unsubscribing noises*
I remember watching all the barbie movies when I was younger..
THE MUSTACHE MAKES U A VIRGIN!!!!! GOTTEMM!!!! DEEZ NUTZ!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😵😵
What the fuck. I didn’t  get A EXTRA GREETING
This was was INTENSE😰
this is literally one of my favorite videos of Kurtis I cant 😭
Nicki reference! MY HEART
wrong winner…
This is the content I didn't know I needed
This is not the content I expected but it’s exactly the content I needed
Instead of an extra greeting, each video begins with a reminder that Kurtis is not, in fact, a virgin
Please review Barbie and The Nutcracker. Watching you rip apart childhood movies is a major source of serotonin
Omg i LOVED barbie as rapunzel growing up
A comment
I've got more respect for you not doing the second greeting. You must have been going crazy saying it every time, like a musician who ends up hating their own song because they have to play it at every show for decades.
You really thought you could sneak that community asshole flag past us
Guys. The Barbie doll from the movie was the best. You could cut off her hair and reattach it
*stares in big eyes and big lips* 👁👄👁
I can't believe Kurtis Conner got political 😳
Petition to make this series with the many many barbie & bratz films
Kurt why didn’t you choose mermaid tale that’s the best Barbie movie
Wonderful to see you today Kurtis
The dark pixies are just egirls
ill be expecting two greetings by next video or its gonna be ur kneecaps kurtman 😡
Auto-liked because of “Do I wanna gnome?”
I love every single commenter who is rightfully pissed that kurtis didn’t review Princess and the pauper. Everyone knows it’s the supreme Barbie movie and this was a bias study 😠
I… I can’t stop staring at the mustache
Wtf is this video..?
WHERE IS MY EXTRA GREETING I NEED THAT POSITIVITY IN MY LIFE
kutis's humor has been very self aware today
This whole video is just Kurtis Conner Out Of Context
This is the ultimate commentary video
Responsible community engagement
My parents never said they were too sexy, they just thought they were sorta racially insensitive despite having more options. Also they thought it was creepy they had no feet under their shoes.
The absolute wave of nostalgia that washed over me seeing the thumbnail was low key overwhelming 😂😭 I grew up on both of those movies but I personally like the Bratz more because they've got a passion for fashion and it shows.. Barbie's a little basic 💀
i just watched Danny's video right before this one, and there was this one takkis commercial with ninja and another dude in yellow and I thought at first it was Kurtis :)
I’m sorry Kurtis, I will not be liking the video today due to the conscious lack of an extra greeting.
*doth thy carpet match thy drapes*
the fact that you chose bratz fashion pixies instead of bratz rock angels THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME is the reason i have unsubbed. good day sir.  (i didnt actually i’m very much still subbed but seriously have a good day kurtis)
I’ve never clicked on a video so fast
Okay but the Bratz Forever Diamondz movie and collection *slapsss*  But also Princess and the Pauper?? Wow
“Doth thou carpets match thy drapes?”  This has me dying 😭😭
Barbie Princess and the Pauper is the movie Kurtis needs to look at I can’t believe he chose rapunzel ;-;
Yes! the video we've been waiting for! To answer some of your questions way too meticulously: - yes, horny pets are a movie thing. The goldfish in Pinocchio is horny AF. and No, I don't think it should be a thing. - I DO remember chalk zone, tho I totally forgot about the name (it's probably something totally different in my first language). No, saying the name did not help, showing the picture did. - The reason small garden gnomes seem scarier than griant ones, is because they can just stand under your legs and jump up so their ceramic pointy hats get into your crotch area. I imagine, despite gender or sex, this HAS to hurt way more than being crushed.
“No extra greeting? That’s fine.” **unsubscribes**
This unlocked some very repressed memories
12:34 sounded kinda good i don’t know what you’re talking about kurtis
0:16 I would buy this on shirt
the bratz movies were something else entirely. they’re so funny in or out of context, and for what.
That barbie movie brought out deeply repressed memories
"rapunzel is bald now" sounded so much like bo burnham
Can i just say how happy I am you chose  barbie rapunzel bc that was the only barbie movie I had 😭 also, yes the lack of music is weird, but they're footsteps was like asmr to me as a child before I knew what asmr was
I remember shitting on my many Barbie dolls for not being as stylish as my one Bratz doll.
1. I'm ready to cancel him again. 2. "Do I wanna gnome?" was hilarious, but the shame, silence and apology that came after it made it an absolute gem.
there was no greeting. clearly this isn’t kurtis, please you strange moustache man, let kurtis out, i need my extra greeting.
Where’s the extra greeting? You’d think Kurtis would have learned from when he got cancelled last time, smh. This town has really fell off.
Stach Game on Point Kurt
Can't believe it took me 5 whole minutes to acknowledge his mullet... How long has he had that? 😂
kurtis: i can do whatever intro i want! i am not what i create! me: well someone watched inside
I caught that Community flag when you were describing barbie’s asshole. Exquisite reference right there.
I LOVED bratz but I wasn't allowed to have one. But I also wasn't allowed boy dolls and anyways i'm gay now
ther is big chungus in barbie movie thats soo lit like if you love big chungus
PLS DO MONSTER HIGH NEXT EACH MOVIE IS IMMACULATE
im begging you please do a monster high movie 😭😭😭
Barbie and the nut cracker is by far the supreme Barbie film!
The fact that he did not use the objectively best barbie movie (princess and the pauper) for a comparison is simply criminal and I will not stand for this injustice and tomfoolery
Dislike for no extra greeting
When you dont get the special greeting
whillhelm is my evil art teacher
The fact that Rapunzel could just leave the tower because the magic spell only works on someone with a lying heart is this movie's equivalent of "that sign won't stop me, because I can't read"
That sneeze is now my favorite ringtone
The out of context compilers are gonna have a b a l l with this one
There are some great barbie movies, and you chose rupenzil, noooo.
NOO THE ABSENCE OF THE EXTRA GREETING IS REALLY TAKING A TOLL ON ME🪦
I had both growing up, but I always played with my bratz, they were so stylish
I was a Bratz kid growing up. But Barbie movies was my ish. I remember in middle school me and this girl would discuss the latest baribe movie that premiered that Saturday on Nick. Like it was a book club. And the Dreamhouse series is really good as well
no extra greeting ??? unsubscribed, leaving kurtistown
you picked one of the worst barbie movies smh
I loved fashion pixiez as a kid, this unlocked so many repressed memories omfg
HE DIDN'T SAY THE THING!!! WHY DIDN'T HE SAY THE THING???
This is strike two Kurtis. You know what happens on the third strike…👁   Just give us the extra greeting and no one has to get hurt
K - virgin U - R - T - I - S -
Kurtis. KURTIS I am absolutely LIVID that you skipped the extra greeting
Hedwig is a she not a he...
The man in the thumbnail with a wild mullet and a creep stash next to a bunch of dolls made me worried ngl, but it still couldn't prepare me for the chaos I was about to witness... Amazing video dude, I laughed my ass off
kurtis drank his funny juice today
But... If no extra greeting then why subscribe... I'm unsubbing 😡😡😡😡 /s
really weird that im watching this while wearing a barbie shirt
That Arctic Monkeys reference was 👌🏽
I loved the repunzel Barbie movie as a kid, but I hated barbies
Virgin mustache
I love this brats movie 😂❤️❤️
barbie movies are the most iconic things ever. my childhood was blessed
hey KURTIS don't you think you letting yourself do too much here? oh now you won't even say an extra greeting anymore? i'm very much disappointed and offended. SHAME ON YOU MAYOR! or should i say mayo, disgusting...
Only a virgin would skip the extra greeting on purpose soooooo
19:34 I laughed WAY too much at that joke.  Me too Dylan. Me too.
I love your mustache!😊😊Please shave it❤️
kurtis made a Barbie and bratz video my life is now complete
How come nobody is talking about HOW BAD THE ANIMATION IS???
😡😡😡
Goddamnit I subscribed, I want my extra greeting.
This video in a nutshell. Barbie, INFERIOR. Bratz, SUPERIOR.
Thank you kurtis
Damn we all got treated the same. As a member of Kurtis Town I am offended you don’t want to greet me but proud of you for making your own decisions
THANK U FOR UPLOADING KURTIS I MISSED U
why so aggressive bro
If I’m not getting an extra greeting then what’s the fuCKING POINT of LiVING
So are we going to ignore the fact that Kurtis looks like a country boy from Alabama? YEE YEE
Kurtis doesn't have virgin vibes
"WHO'S THE BETTER DOLL?!" Have you seen Rozen Maiden?🙃
PLEASE WATCH BARBIE MERMAIDIA OR FAIRYTOPIA WHICHEVER HAS BIBBLE AND THEN WATCH BRATZ ROCK ANGELS PLEASEEEEE I BEG OF YOU
*angry twerking* 😡                                 👚                                🦵       Yes the creature has only one leg, that’s why it’s angry.
"bratz are the sluts in every barbie dreamhouse" who's going to tell them barbie was based on a german sex doll ?
"Im not gonna do the thing that will easily solve my problems until I absolutely have to." Honestly, sounds like me in quarantine not even brushing my teeth at times. lol
Kurpis, I have been following you for a while now and I have to say I'm very disappointed.  I can't believe you would betray us, your fans who pay your bills by watching your content,  in such a disrespectful way. The first time you apologized and said your behavior would change but today you proved it wrong and made your fans look dumb. You purposefully went against us and laughed about it. You OWE us an extra greeting like you promised. I simply cannot support you anymore😣☝
Not Kurtis watching the movie I watched every single day in 2010, because I genuinely thought I was an Evil Pixie and I wanted to find a cure 😭.  Bratz Fashion Pixies really changed my 5 year old life, so if you love Barbie I really suggest you watch Fashion Pixies YOU WON'T REGRET IT
I HAD THE RAPUNZEL BARBIE DOLL!!!!!!!!!
we wouldn’t be having this end result if he had watched barbie princess and the pauper or barbie magic of pegasus 🙄
But like… can we get a series? 🥺👉🏻👈🏻
As someone who watch Barbie their whole life I'll say Barbie is good nostalgic wise but brats is just way more fun to watch
NO EXTRA GREETING???? AND a VIRGIN??? this is not very really good, kirtus. i’m so upset, my heart is broken.   get this man behind some barbied-wire 😡😡
The dances in the Bratz movie are the funniest thing I have ever seen and I actually can not take this
NOT ONLY DID HE FORGET THE EXTRA GREETING, HE FORGOT THE FIRST ONE!
"Do I wanna gnome" That....that is peak comedy
breaking news: very really good ack stands for virgin
ya hoooo da ba yo
Please talk about Monster High next. Thank you!
i will take no hate on the bratz movie it’s so good
Did I not get my extra greeting. UMM unsubscribe
the angry twerking scene got me rolling on the floor
great video Kurt, i was crying laughing the entire time lmao glad you managed to get it done
The barbie movie just took everything that made the story of Rapunzel compelling and interesting and threw it out the window
So you're telling me that you're trying to figure out the quality of Barbie movies and you picked *_Barbie as Rapunzel?_* That's the decision you made? There are so many amazing movies that you could have picked. I can think of several off the top of my head: _Barbie & the Diamond Castle, Barbie in A Christmas Carol, Barbie: Mariposa, Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper,_ and _Barbie: Mariposa & the Fairy Princess_ come to mind immediately. And you pick _Barbie as Rapunzel._ You pick *_BARBIE AS F*CKING RAPUNZEL._* I trusted you, Kurtis. This is unacceptable. You are legally obligated to watch one of those movies now. I dare you to watch one of those and then say that Bratz movies are better. _Barbie & the Diamond Castle_ is an amazing movie. I watch it a fair amount, to be frank. It's the Sapphic cottagecore movie of our dreams. And you pick _Barbie as Rapunzel._ I'm disappointed.
Hedwig is a girl tho?
Hello, Kurtis. This is Mattel. We’re suing.
okay i think that this would have been more fair if he picked a better barbie movie, in my opinion that's one of the best bratz movies made, but there are way better barbie movies
no extra greeting!? oof, the one and only reason to subscribe this suddenly gone
when kurtis started dancing like a bratz character i fucking lost it
Can you do mafia city ads compilation pls pls pls
watch the Film theory about Tangled
kurits. please get rid of the mustche . it killed my grandmother
I loved the Bratz dolls, the mini ones. I wasn't a fan of the regular sized dolls for some reason, but I just loved the style of the Bratz dolls better.
i am begging you to watch the barbie diaries
15k holes for him to dig..
I like both, because I grew up with both. But I think you should watch all of the Barbie movies and bratz movies. Because they both have their great and amazing movies and their not as good movies. I think you should watch all of them before you make a final decision on who’s better because that’s like saying well I did a study for an essay, but I only have one example for each franchise to compare. I think you should compare all of the movies from both the bratz and Barbie to make a justified conclusion. I like both franchises but I think that one movie from each is not enough to generalize both entire franchises.
NO EXTRA GREETING REEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     (You do you, still love the content :) )
no wilhelm scream kurtis? what kind of comedian
The key to not being a virgin is liking Bratz more than Barbie.
the do i wanna gnome joke is the best and worst thing you’ve ever done
2:53 can't fool me, i know the glandale community college flag when i see it
I am so happy to be getting this content thank you King 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
kurtis has been trying super hard to look like julien solomita lately
i mean he picked a remake and a completely original story. ofc the origional story wins. but with a better barbie movie who knowz
I love this so much it was so entertaining and funny to watch especially about Kelly lol, i never thought that Kelly looked weird until now so thank Kurtis
I always liked Barbie more than Bratz but I did like that Bratz was more diverse in terms of racial representation.
You monster
calling a town meeting to demand extra greetings
Next episode, I want an extra extra extra greeting next video Kurtis, or I swear I’m gonna be very disappointed
Should’ve done Barbie princess and the pauper it’s one of the best Barbie movies 😩
this video gave me so much laughs
as a recent subscriber binging all your videos i took personal offense to this "no greeting" nonsense
Kurtis; doesn't do the extra greeting Me, screaming; WHAT IS HAPPENING
20:53 sooo are they implying that gingers arent fairies and dont have souls bc all the other humans got fairy wings but she didnt
Bratz coming back is incredibly smart. Teens and young adults dress like Bratz dolls… from indie to Y2K…. Making a fashion line for teens and then a doll line for preteens would be a great move
you explained the whole bratz plot in detail and I still didnt get it wow
Bless you
Fashion pixies is like one of my comfort movies man
Now we just need drew to upload today
Bratz animation is some of the ugliest things put to screen I’ve seen in my life
Well I've given up on having a decent sense of humor. I laughed at Barbie saying balls every time
love the part where she goes Melveeeeno..
Love it, I would def watch more of this
✨Do I wanna Gnome ✨✨ I’d love to hear a full version
You just made new enemies...Day Traders
Also I wish he watched Kidz fairy tales I think he'd lose his shit at the gnome boy band
This video just unlocked SO many childhood memories
“MATTEL ME THAT” LMAOOO
Wood chipper? I hardly know her!
I love Kurtis so much for pointing out toxic beauty standards👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
This is so funny, Kurt you never stop to amuse me
good video. 👍 10/10
Amazing.
Let’s not forget when Mattel made a knock off bratz line called My Scene which included a more diverse cast and a web series (fun fact the web series once featured Lindsay Lohan)
bratz is superior
This is your best video! I couldn't stop laughing!!
There movies look like a sims machinema
You should’ve watched Barbie Fairy Secret to properly compare the movie . It’s hilarious and honestly , Ken is an icon there
honestly? i respect and am glad he doesn't do the extra greeting anymore. you could really tell it was starting to bother him over the last few greetings
jokes on you because I **ONLY** subscribed for that extra greeting so..... bye.
Hedwig is a girl
Kurtis: "I'm not a virgin!" Me: [looking at his moustasche] "Suuure...."
"MATELL ME THAT" 😄😄😄 Unlike barbie I could've easily shat myself laughing about that pun. No joke. I have a simple mind
I like both dolls lol
ya hooo da ba yo
"Bald Kurtis isn't real, he can't hurt you !" *Bald Kurtis :* 10:14
Retitle: Why barbies are better than bratz
10:59 I WAS WAITING FOR THIS SCENE😭😭😭
Babe wake up, new Kurtis Conner video
Bratz look like snooki from jersey shore
"do i wanna gnome"
A'hunting we will go, a'hunting we will go, we'll catch a fox, put it in a box and then we'll let it go
Yo hoo da ba yo
the extra greeting is what waters my villages crops, without it our people will starve. how dare you kurtis
PLEASEEE WHEN KURTIS DOES THE DANCES ITS SO FUNNY
harder? i barely know her!
i just miss the barbie and bratz ps2 games
You will be happy to know that little sister Kelly was killed off and replaced with mildly less terrifying and slightly older Chlesea
great video kurtboy i’m very proud of you👍🏻
kurtis stop releasing merch right after i spent my money istg
9:30 as someone who has long hair I like how disney kinda handled it, she had a hook thing to basically create leverage and also reduce direct strain on the hair/scalp and it just makes the whole scene a lot less hard to look at. Still dunno how the physics of her braiding 70 feet of hair and making it magically turn into like... 6 feet at most works
they can see them when the pixies want to be seen. but the good pixies live in harmony as people!!
Ya hooo da ba yo
As much as I agree with Kurtis here I feel like those movies just don't do either franchise justice There are some BANGERS in both the barbie and bratz community
Kurtis got some hair on his lip then said "FUCC THAT EXTRA GREETING AND FUCC YOU". All grown up. I'm here for it.
1:28
I saw that Greendale logo
16:39 thought they were gonna say she was trans for a sec I got so excited
i honestly thought there was a guitar hero 2 sticker on his cabinet at first, and i dont know if im relieved or disappointed that its just on a box      no, yknow what, definitely disappointed
No extra greeting? Yeah, I’m unsubscribing now. There’s no incentive.
i stopped watching at 0:36
Love you Kurtis🙌🙌💖
Fun fact: Hedwig is actually a female
you’re one of the best editors on this website
17:26 Kurtis make this your ‘starting soon’ twitch screen
#KurtisConnerIsOverParty 🙄
Nice Greendale flag cameo!
No extra greeting ... that stache has changed you.
Bratz had diversity, Barbie movies are quite gay… so Idk what to think
guys we need to impeach kurtis and elect kiwi.
Also cailíní means girls
that gnome joke was the most terrible thing i've ever heard. i've liked and subscribed.
#kancelkurtiskonner we need our extra greeting!
AHHOOOOHADEAHOO
19:27 me when im watching a movie with my aunt who wont stop asking questions when we’re only 5 minutes in
They did a study and across all dolls, barbie(even som of the older ones) have a more average body proportion than any other dolls (because they actually have hips and a visible torso)
barbie princess and the pauper vs bratz babyz is terrifying
I WATCHED THAT BARBIE MOVIE AND I WAS SO CONFUSED I ABSOLUTELY HATE THE WEASEL HE'S WEIRD IN THE FRENCH VERSION TOO
kurtis i hope that you know that i will hold a personal grudge against you for not giving us an extra greeting until the day i die
can we retire the Not Getting An Extra Greeting "jokes" now? they're so old, run-down and unfunny. come on yall are better than this
nah, monster high is the best one duhhhh
Haha I’m so sorry you look like my friends dad bald- 😭 I’m so sorry lmao omfg
3:41  ah hi, a non-english native here, what did he say?   "I'll be sending _the seset to sest_ " what??  thank you
Barbie and Bratz movies were such a big part of my childhood so it’s so cool to revisit the movies through this video!! Diamond castle was always my favorite :)
Kurtis, monster high was the doll line with the best movies, they had a move e discussing police brutality
Why is Barbie saying balls with an echo so funny
Kurtis has "I'm ready to fight" energy here, I LOVE IT
missed opportunity to say “testiscrolls”
Stopped watching when he refused to do an extra greeting. Very rude Kurtis
I didn’t realize how creepy these movies looked
i’m so lucky I’m not depressed right now because if I was and I heard that gnome joke it would’ve triggered a mental breakdown
ya hooo da ba yo
EXTRA GREETING?!?! that was very really bad of you, real virgin attitude 😒
kurtis bratz fashion pixies was my favorite movie as a young lad 🙌
I may be bias since these were my favorite movies as a kid but this is honestly my favorite video of yours, I am crying laughing. Also good job on stopping with the extra greeting bit, I appreciated it but I remember you mentioning that you didn’t enjoy doing it anymore and I know stopping must have been a hard decision, I hope you don’t let any comments about it get you down. Have a good day Kurtis :)
“This was your one chance for Kelly to not look like what stubbing your toe feels like”  Wtf why is this so accurate😳
no i need my extra greeting. i can’t live without it
Kurtis and Danny posting both on the same day less than a couple hours apart is making my day.
Make a vid doing the mbti personality test pls <3
bratz kids sleep over traumatized me as a kid....you should watch it :)
this video is top tier 🧃
Y'all remember Bratz: Fairytales? That sh*t popped off and the music was good as well. The 7 dwarves were a boy band 👀
I mean, Ben Shapiro has a podcast so I would think virgins could have one.
that "EWWW" is from a different Bratz movie i know it.. u can't trick us!!
agree to disagree
"Barbie Flair" as a nickname for Bobby Flay is the hardest I've laughed! In a while!
UMMMM no give me an extra greeting NOW.
barbie had a much better plot, and the montage scene was so much better tbh
Kurtis is objectively wrong. also barbie princess and the pauper is the best movie ever made
How the fuck did I not get an extra greeting, it's been a good ride but I am unsubbing. Sorry kurt boi
I literally can’t believe the day has come when I feel old! 👵🏾
NO EXTRA GREETING!
When Kurtis's mustache is at full power he can be on the gus and Eddy podcast
why does balls echo for an uncomfortably long time
you need to watch princess and the pauper
I can’t believe he kept calling Chloe, Sasha, Yasmin, and Jade her “friends”
I’m usually a big fan of kurtis but i have to call this out bc no one else will. At 2:54 , you used the Greendale Community College flag in a disrespectful way. As a Greendale Human Being, I find that astronomically offensive. Especially since you chose to omit our school motto (E Pluribus Anus) which should always accompany the crest. I hope you apologize soon.
KURTIS PLEASE I CANT LISTEN TO YOU WITH THAT MUSTACHE PLEASE JUSTT SHAVE IT KURTIS PLEASE I CANT DO THIS
No extra greeting....it's like he doesn't even care about us anymore... ;-;
Watch Barbie in Princess and the Pauper! The music is actually good and story is enjoyable :)
it's not the same without the extra greeting give it back now kurtis
This video is so funny bruh, thank u Kurtis for this gem <3
ya hooo da ba yo
The Barbie "balls" soundbyte was just as funny every single time
I wish you had chosen the barbie movie where the villain plays a magical fart-flute
10:15 HEY THAT'S RIPPED OUT OF SHREK 3
ive watched that barbie movie so many times omg
Glad to see you picked the best Barbie movie 💁🏻‍♀️
I could tell my boys been over the intro for a while and I’m okay with that 😌🙏
This is so chaotic thank you for making this
i will never forgive kurtis for not giving us a greeting and bashing barbie
I'm genuinely so thrown off by the lack of extra greeting and idk if I can watch the rest of the video now with this feeling of something missing.  😭
personally i was a monster high kid
Dude you don't understand, the weasel is ICONIC in the Brazilian dub. When Gothel is chasing the prince, he says "Pega ele! Frita ele! Faz purê!" which is basically "get him! Fry him! Make him into puree" or whatever, and I can't stress enough how amazing that dub is.
i almost peed myself of how much i was laughing omfg
Ayo babe wake up. Kurtis Conner just dropped a new video. *Twerks swimmingly*
If you ever want to do a deep dive into Barbie, I recommend caitlovesdisney or Seamus Gorman. They're both pretty well versed in Barbie lore.
kurtis calling the main Bratz characters "Brianna's friends" is just my favorite thing
Bratz were supposed to look cartoonish and not realistic unlike barbie which looks very realistic and not cartoonish at all except for the cartoonish proportions of her doll body. It was meant to push that look
Kurtis please make a vid on small soldiers. Cause amazing. And you could save Gorgon
A kurtis Conner video without an extra greeting is already a tragedy. But the mayor himself not doing it ON PURPOSE is a disgrace for kurtistown. I expect better from him in the future. If not we should consider re-electing the mayor. I don’t make the rules.
Omg watching these movies with him made me so nostalgic 🤦🏻‍♀️ I used to watch Barbie movies all the time. I liked them so much for some reason.
I’m finally early
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE!
“you don’t have a dad or a bank account” is too iconic of a line for kurtis not to review the Bratz movie
I hate that weasel so much I SWEAR HE WAS SO CREEPY AS A KID :(
but barbies dress is pretty
"can a virgin have a podcast" I mean Awsten Knight has one so
Well fuck! Now we can't cancel him again because we wasted our Twitter powers
it's funny he calls the main characters of Bratz just her friends lol..
Kurtis is possessed by his evil mustache and that’s why we didn’t get an extra greeting
ya hooo da ba yo
kurtis,,, can't believe this man
Barbie gave us bibble tho!
Kurtis, you brought me back like, 18 years! I LOVED the Barbie/Bratz movies and am glad you took time to watch and review them!
Kurtis, you're too late for Harry's mustache era
"do I wanna gnome~?" That took me out hahahaaa 💀💀
Wait but what about the Barbie movies made to compete with brats movies. Ex: MyScene Jammin in Jamaica.   The opening scene has an original song that gives me horny weasel vibes
“I DIDNT MEAN IT IM DESPERATE” GET EM KURT
As the Stache grows so does the Boomer
Ok this officially my new favorite video by Kurtis
I stg this guy gets funnier and funnier in every vid
The scene from the Matrix is definitely different... AND BETTER!
I think I will unsubscribe bc there is no point anymore when I don’t even get an extra greeting😒
BUT I PRESSY SUBSCRIBEY WHERE'S MY EXTRA GREETING
18:59 not the shade to James Charles lmaooo
Ok now monster high 😀
god, these movies hit really different years later. The animation looked so good back then
I'm waiting for the barbie community to riot lmaoooo no shade
Omg i send my friend the new kurtis vid right UK WHAT SHE TELLs ME       *why does kurtis have mud on his face*       EVERYONE SIGN THIS PETITION TO GET RID OF KURTIS FACE MUD
Only a virgin would think Hedwig is a boy
18:58 the SHADE 💀
I missed the extra greeting
Both so good, fashion pixies was 👌👌👌
i thought the end said “leave a comment if you jerk” and i didn’t even question it because of all those jokes he made
this might be your best video to date. really well done, great commentary, funny as hell. good job, kurt
Bratz was and still is everything to me
My mom hated bratz dolls because she viewed them as promoting girls to be brats (which in hindsight... she took that branding wayyyy too literally). I think Barbie movies often taught good lessons and there was kind of an underlying theme of empowering girls to believe in themselves. This Bratz movie kinda just had a what the fuck plot line and didn’t really do anything more than kinda show friendship is good?
At 22.20 he looks exactly like a serial killer that people say were weirdos as a child
sooo i think its only fair for u to watch the best movies from both. which is the princess and the pauper (barbie) abd then the carnival bratz one
I was only subscribed for the greeting. You hurt me man. It hurted
I grew up with both these movies, but bratz movies tend to recycle their character models
This video is genuinely giving me so much comfort
ya hoo da- wait, you know what? is MY COMMENT so this time I am NOT commenting what is in the description ok?! I want my extra greeting and you'd better get me two next time lmao
so glad you chose to watch Fashion Pixies…. ICONIC. ACADEMY AWARD! not to mention the phenomenal rave scene……
I don't know why, but I lost it with the " I don't wanna gnome"
kurtis what the fuck im only subrcribed for the extra greeting. idgaf about ur content I just want the greeting. unsubcribed.
I can promise you the rat’s voice does NOT sound horny in the Spanish (Spain at least) … this is the first time I’ve heard this movie in English and it makes me uncomfortable
I hated all the bratz films as a kid honestly, the animation was just...,,,,worse lol
No extra greeting during pride month, awfully suspicious Mr. Connor
Misgendering Hedwig? During pride month? Kurtis my guy 😔
Kurtis, Rapunzel couldn't leave on Penelope bc Penelope was scared of heights 🙄
19:00 James Charles - holding myself accountable lol
1:25 HES A BARB 🦄🦄🦄🦄💞💞💞💋💋💋💋💋💋💋 💅🏻💅🏻💅🏻💅🏻💅🏻💅🏻
Holy shit I remember that Barbie movie
Not Kurtis ignoring Penelope’s fear of heights
There is some delightful irony that Barbie was ripped off of an actual sex doll from Germany then they turn around and trash Bratz.
Thank you for reminding me of chalk zone.
i can't believe kurtis didnt watch the best barbie movie ever aka diamon castle
Kurtis, frankly I feel cheated, and betrayed. The fact that you would out right refuse to give me my extra greeting shows your utter lack of respect for your fans, and I simply will not stand for it. Truly this betrayal is unforgivable, and unforgettable. I am sorry, but I cannot support a person who Whom clearly does not respect either me, or the promise you have made with your fans and upheld in every one of your videos, expect for that one time, and it truly saddens me to see what you have become.  #kurtisConnerisoverparty
My man really picked one of the worse ones hdfjsd— I would’ve suggested Princess and The Pauper. (Mostly because that one song slaps but that’s not important)
Before i even start this video I just want to say, I was such a huge Bratz girl when I was little and a couple of months ago my roommate and I got super drunk and were watching old disney shows. This got us into a nostalgia conversation and i drunkenly bid on Bratz babies on ebay and had to buy the big baby Yazmine doll and the rock babies dolls Roxy and Phoebe. I got them in and let me just say… worth it. 💋
Kurtis should shave down the middle and get a soul patch to get the Javier look
the jokes on this one are mwah hilarious
Turtle  ,          ..
Cough cough monster high cough cough
Where's the one true expert on the barbie movies Seamus Gorman
If you want the strongest example of a Barbie movie, you need to watch the Princess and the Pauper.
So happy that I knew this virgin announcement was coming because I listen to the best podcast being produced right now
Okay so I was a bratz girl growing up but Barbie in the Princess and the Pauper goes SO hard,, so if you decide to watch any more doll movies please put that at the top of the list.
i didnt like the stache last time but i love this one
One thing Bratz did great was making the whole concept fun, i love Barbie and what they stand for (women can do it all) but kids just want to have fun and worry about simple things. Also Kelly was súper disturbing wtf.
Kurt looks like he wants me in his white van
You should have watched Bratz Rock Angels !!! Soundtrack was awesome and i love it as a kid
I demand an hour of Kurtis doing the dances from the Bratz movie
Curtis: "which is better? Barbie or Bratz?" neither, because Monster High is clearly superior.
I've seen every bratz movie and I had every bratz doll.....yep
Give him to me... EŰGH😩😩😩
6:35 I LOVE YOU 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 i was dyinnnngggg
that weasel is every furry ever
oi why didn’t you mention penelopes dad AT ALL!? he was my fave character
While your explanation of VRG is good in theory, I think it might just stand for Very Really Goodvirgin
I remember watching the Bratz Sleepover Adventure movie and I’m still traumatized by the house of mirrors part. That was terrifying.
The Bratz movie, oh my god, I was expecting that movie. SO GLAD HE PICKED THIS ONE, IT'S SO NOSTALGIC TO ME
Apparently YouTube unsubscribed me. 😩
Come on, everyone chant with me “shave that shit!” 😅
I'm here for my extra greeting now my day is RUINED.
let me just say , if he would have watched the princess and the pauper , there would have been NO CONTEST ! He had to choose one of the inferior barbie movies XDD
the gnome says "YAHOOOOO IM A GNOME"
Haven’t even started the video, KURTIS BRATZ BETTER BE THE WINNER HERE
KURTIS HOW DARE YOU NOT GIVE ME MY EXTRA GREETING WE AGREED WHEN I SUBSCRIBED THAT I WOULD GET AN EXTRA ONE EVERY VIDEO AND YOU ARE NOT HGOLDIUNG UP OT YOPU R WORD I DEMAND IT N OW OR IA M UNS UBESCRIBING A ND TYLELING ELON MUSK (my dad, long story) TO DELLETE YOUR CHANNEL
Are You A Virgo Tho?
The fact you didn't mention the iconic dress scene in Rapunzel disappoints me
I rly like the new merch, if I had money I would buy it just on looks alone
I like bratz dolls, BUT BARBIE MOVIES JUST HITS DIFFERENT, you know?
If you had watched the princess and the pauper the outcome would be way different, How Can I Refuse is a bop
11:43 me Not even then, though
Ya hooooooo da ba yo
I love barbie movies and bratz dolls and fashion does that make sense
I thought the title of this video was Barbie vs BARBZ and I was waiting for the Nicki Minaj commentary
I haven't watch it but just you know, I looove Barbie and Bratz x) I'm scared.
disliking because i didn’t get an extra greeting /j
Love how this king who is attacking a nation is just…  Digging really deep holes for people to fall in
I had completely forgotten about Barbie as Rapunzel, I actually watched that at some point as a kid.
Wait isn't Jenny Nicholson doing like a 4 hour version of this?
the barbie movie brought back so many memories oh my god. looking back idk how i wasn’t terrified of all the barbie movies, i literally loved them. i also don’t remember the weasel ALWAYS MOANING WTF
kurtis, barbie princess and the pauper is one of the greatest films of all time im begging u to reconsider ur stance on barbie vs bratz
ngl the matrix scene with no sound is kinda powerful sorry kurtis
23:38 I CANT JSAAHBJDVHBAJHVJB
Doesn't count, you didn't watch the best barbie movie, Princess and the Pauper
Everytime I want to make a pun, Kurtis does it as soon as I post the comment
“I didn’t mean it I’m desperate” fav joke of the video 😂
Bratz Pixies is the absolute best Bratz movie. don't test me!!!
BRATZ WON AS IT SHOULD
Now we NEED Kurtis to review Monster High please 😭✋
What about “My scene”? , those dolls were cool too(灬˘ᴗ˘灬)و ̑̑
THE RABBITS NAME IS HOBI ????
10:20 "Penelope, the dragon who can fly up really high" ok I'll stop you right there, you clearly weren't paying attention because Penelope's conflict in the beginning of the movie IS THAT SHE IS SCARED OF FLYING REALLY HIGH smh Kurtis
It is actually perfectly plausible that climbing up Rapunzel’s hair wouldn’t hurt her. This is because of the way she wrapped her hair around the post. This releases the tension from her scalp and it acts like a rope. It’s like a pulley system, and it provides some slack that allows her to support that weight without scalping herself. The problem here is the actual weight of her hair. Perhaps she gets used to the weight by building up that muscle, but pulling so much weight constantly is effectively tearing her scalp apart.
no offense but bratz certainly won
imagine not being a virgin
only a virgin wouldnt give us an extra greeting.
Wow this is amazing and I haven't even watched the video
3:34 We are consered that bratz may be replicating the experience that barbie is know for .Never let the meme die.
i feel scammed. i signed up for an extra greeting and now you're refusing??? scammy behaviour if ive seen it, smh. im ashamed of u. smh.
bless u
Yaa hooo da ba yo
0:01 into the video BRATZ WINS FYM
Rapunzel in Shrek the third was bald
not my mind immediately going to jhope from bts when he said hobi I'm in this bangtansonyeondan shit for life man
ya hoo da ba yo!!!
Very Really Gvirgin
WHERE THE F**K IS MY F**KING EXTRA GREETING
DO I WANNA GNOME?????
hi my name is stephen im 46 man i love babrie and kids who go see it they very ncie
the shade at James Charles
pega ele frita ele faz pureee
Barbie was my jammmmm
There were 99 dislikes and even though I laughed so hard that I woke my dog, and I simply thought this was the best video Kurt has made, I hated that it wasn't 100.
I honestly think Disney ripped off some things from Barbie As Rapunzel for Tangled
*Angry twerking*
21:30 also, if we're saying that all fire hydrants are lawn gnomes, that scene earlier where the girls are chased away is 1000% more insane and scary
#kurtisiscancelled
Bratz❤️‍🔥
I like this video essay arc
would love to see kurtis’ unedited footage from a video like this
Kurtis should watch a Monster High movie, Boo York Boo York is the best and the only musical one
Barbie and the Twelve Dancing Princesses is my favorite Barbie movie. It’s so fuckin weird I love it
Have I watched all the bratz and barbie movies four times over? Yes. Yes I have.
i grew up with both- and i would play with both however i loved bratz more but sadly wasnt able to get them so i ended up playing with monster high dolls which are better than both of them so-
you are not even the s Demographic kurtis! go home
I LIVE FIVE MINUTES AWAY FROM THE GIANT GARDEN GNOME WTF- BESTIE I DRIVE BY THAT FARM LIKE EVERY DAY ✋💀
so weird to see these movies get reviewed because i watched these as a kid, glad i wasn’t the only one who thought the weasel was weird
The minute I saw that weasel I thought: GiVe HiM tO Me UGH 😩
Mine was one of the parents that never let me have bratz dolls
For some reason my childhood best friend and I used to watch Bratz: Babyz the Movie every time we had a sleepover. I watched that movie at least 20 times
How about restocking your PBNTM merch collection before I go berserk!!!
YES!!! Bratz all the way!!!! XD
I subscribed JUST FOR THE EXTRA GREETING!!!!!!! I feel like one of those losers who don't get the extra greeting.
We know he doesn’t have daughters, because he’s a vrgn
Virgins don't greet people. Kurtis a virgin confirmed.
kurtis looks like he's going through a midlife crisis (respectfully)
You think we’re gonna let you get away with not doing the extra greeting? I’m suing you for false advertisement. I subscribed to you for an extra greeting every single video, and you choose to disrespect your patrons like this. Very Really Good? More like Very Really BAD. Your willful offense will not go unpunished.
you totally missed the chance to call ball scrolls "scrolltum"
Myscene dolls were the superior ones !
i dont mind bratz or barbie stuff and your video was funny, but idk i dont want i video to see which one is better ya know? then again its ur channel make whatever you want and i still watched it because you make anything u talk about really funny so- well anyways cant wait for the next vid!<3
virgis conner
kurtis should’ve reacted to the bratz sleepover movie with those scary ass monsters at the end of the movie, or even the one at the theme part with those god awful potato aliens
The fact that Kurtis is no offically team Bratz🤣😭
lol the james charles reference
Do I wanna gnome caught me off guard ✋😭😭😭
Kurtis why no extra greeting :(((
mario?? are you mario?
Not to even mention monster high that’s a whole mother story
y’all the extra greeting does not matter 😭 this video was amazing and all y’all can comment about is kurtis saying “nuh uh” to saying hello twice…
Um akchually if you look closely you'll see that during the climbing scene Rapunzel's hair is tied around a pillar, thus transferring the weight of the prince to the pillar and not Rapunzel's scalp. They actually thought of this.
kurtis i want you to know that you have immaculate taste, bratz dolls are far more innovative and interesting and this is even reflected in the movies
Seamus Gorman who? I only know Surtis Gonner
this is kurtis branching out to the doll community
i cant beilive that kurtis is a virgin so sad smh
the bratz movie is literally anti-goth propaganda
God, Kurtis. Can we stop pitting girlbosses against each other?
what a lost opportunity of collabing with @trixiemattel
I love how you talk about the most random shit but its still rellevevant somehow
I always liked the Bratz dolls better than Barbie. But I never watched any Bratz shows, just the Barbie movies. My favorite was and always will be The Princess and the Pauper
Kurtis review the Bratz PS2 game
But will the greetings be back ? I feel like I subscribed and he hit me w the ol’ bait and switch
Every day, Kurtis looks more and more like a camp councillor-muppet hybrid, and I’m here for it
I remember the Bratz movie very vividly yet very differently from what I'm seeing and hearing now
Representation is important. #IBSBarbie
It would be awesome to see you react to more Bratz and Barbie movies, the Bratz sleepover movie gave me sooo many nightmares as a kid and I think it's important that everyone knows of Bibble the War Criminal from the Barbie fairytopia movies
Growing up I was a bratz girl I absolutely loved them
oh my word fix your face
Bro the barbie repunzel is so good! I remember thinking the whole movie was so satisfying for some reason lol.
No bratts are definitely worse.... they're oversexual.
Kurtis you need to watch barbie in princess and the pauper to join the preminger supremacy cause!
Obsessed with barbie and bratz movies as a kid, but ultimately as an adult I collect bratz. The bratz come back technically happened already with the first edition re release at hot topic (coming to Amazon, Walmart and target in july if you're in the US). And the revolution makeup collab that launched today. Lookin bratz is a good source for anyone that wants to keep up with it!
the reason why her hair doesnt hurt when he climbs is because it's wrapped around the pillar
Combine them, and you get Barbz.
yay u and Danny uploaded
I’d never cry under a tree. Ya hooo da ba yo.
Wait til kurtis finds out that there's a theory that the bratz pixie movie is about drugs 😃
bratz fashion pixies is a masterpiece and i will not take any criticism on this opinion
21:58 AHSJDKAJAJEHKSKAHASJAK IM FVCKING CRYING
ya hooo da ba yo good video
Im from South America, and vrg has a different meaning here. Every time I read it I start laughing, sorry kurtis
ery eally ood
No extra greeting Kurt?! Wtf bro, a few more videos like this and I’ll have to wait for it to come back
Sorry but this was actually hilarious
I fuck with Bratz movies and the animated series? FUCK YEAH
Ok I unsuscribe
The fact that I didn't get an extra greeting . . . am I a virgin?
a very really good VIRGIN
ya hooo da ba yo
Kurtis’ hate for Kelly SENT ME
I definitely had the Ken Doll of Stefan as a child. Also, I looked at the IMDB and they got Anjelica Huston (Morticia Addams) to voice Gothel! Thats where the whole budget went I guess 🤷🏻‍♀️
i am extremely offended. the fact that you purposely left out the extra greeting leaves me absolutely flabbergasted. i am so hurt among many others who feel the same. as a big creator i expect much more from you. do better kurtis.
The Bratz part with the angry twerking had me dying laughing
Not the content we wanted, but the content we deserve.
Uhm those are Unipegasus's Kurtis....
Scroll-tum was right there, Kurtis. C’mon
For anybody wondering about the hair climbing thing: in the original grimms story it's actually described how Rapunzel wraps it around a hook on the window, so most of the strain would be on the hair and not the scalp, head or neck^^ all of the other adaptions just never took that into account  Edit: I think Tangled did that as well, though
I never really played with any sort of dolls. (except for monster high.) But I really just love the Barbie movies and the Bratz movies the whole bunch I never played with the toys. I love them both so much. Bratz babies & Barbie princess and the pauper are both one of my favorites ever
I don’t know if i can continue the video without the extra greeting..💔
Curtis you’re going to make my eBay bids way too high bro I’m trying to buy my childhood dolls
That whole intro could be turned into some merch.
He really did address in his next
I look forward to your videos and find myself rewatching old ones, lmao.  Also, that 500 would be an insane atheist blessing for me
I honest to god subscribed for the extra greeting so I knew I was on the inside of the joke when he does it I sadly may have to unsubscribe
I LOVE THE ANGRY TWERKING
"Dylan walked so e-boys could run their fingers through their hair"😂😂😂
#i_stand_with_barbiephobia
Man for a second I forgot  I was watching a Barbie movie  and thought I was watching something  from the same studio who bought us ratatoing
Kurtis what the fuck. That could have been my last straw.
I was disappointed when you review Barbie as the Princess And The Pauper but then you reviewed THE BEST BRATZ MOVIE EVER
The Barbie Rapunzel CD-ROM game INVENTED gaming
I love the way his brain works
When I was little Rapunzel was my favorite fairy tale and since the Disney version didn't exist yet, this was the only Rapunzel I had, and it was my absolute favorite movie! Its so weird and bad, but i had the barbie, and the computer game they made for it!! So I'm loving watching you talk about it, and I'm dying because of the horney weasel, I didn't remember him sounding so crazy!
this is twelve dancing princesses erasure
No extra greeting🤬🤬
The thing with it hurting if someone climbed your hair was actually something I noticed Tangled kinda fixed a little by wrapping around a hook so it's sort of like when you brush your hair and it hurts, so you hold that section off with your hand and brush it and it doesn't hurt.
The pet weasel  looks a little bit like you
call me crazy but bald kurtis looks like creed from the office
Bruh, not me having that dragon plush when I was 6 😂🐉💕
why would I subscribe if I'm not getting an extra greeting at the beginning of every. single. video?
Barbie as Rapunzel was my favourite movie as a littlw kid
Kurtis you HAVE to watch the Barbie Diaries!!!
Rapunzel was probably like the worst one of the Barbie movies, the other ones where so good tho 😩
The bush-ier his mustache gets, the more he looks like weird al.
GIVE US AN EXTRA GREETING YOU VIRGIN
Haven't watched the video yet, but I'm here to fight the Bratz people. BARBIE SUPERIORITY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bratz supremacy babez
CURTIS HONEY, it was a REALLY important plot point that Penelope is scared of heights   Pay 👏 attention 👏
today is a good day, my boys are uploading 😌👩‍🦲
You should've done a head to head with their musicals barbies island princess vs Bratz Kidz fairytales
3:41 don’t worry kurtis...i have it on pretty good authority that he’s already been taken care of
Kurtis didn't ruin my childhood nostalgia, he just made it 10x better. I cant stop cry laughing, absolutely unhinged video
Stephen looks like a generic sims 2 character
If I ain't getting an extra greeting- I'm not being nice to you. Fuck your law Kurtis.
"Doth thy carpet match thy drapes " LMAOOO
I have been scammed... SCAMMED!! out of my 2nd greeting. Eurgh. So mad
*angry twerking*
Yeah well that's what a VRG would say >.>
the fact that you didn't watch barbie as the princess and the pauper is homophobic tbh
Guys when kurtis brought up the rapunzel barbie movie i thought the bratz movie he'd react to was gonna be the fairy tale one (& either way the bratz plot was much better imo-) PLEASE tell me someone knows what im talking about its literally my childhood & i rewatched it the other day 😭
I have my headphones in at work while listening to this and I just laughed out loud and snorted at "scrotum scroll" and my coworkers just gave me such a weird look 🤣❤ thanks for making my Friday
ya hooo da ba yo
The old Barbie movies had a absolutely beautiful dreamy scenery! But i like the vlog style now too. Bratz PS2 games and the animated series was just soo good, it was my  childhood and I still play it now n listen to the soundtrack. To summarize they were both funny I want them both back and still love them as an adult.
I am asphyxiating trying not to laugh at Kurtis talk about otto while at work 💀💀💀💀
27?!?!?!?????!!?
I laughed so hard I peed my pants
The barbie v. bratz  lawsuit was actually because a former barbie employee had allegedly come up with the bratz designs while still working for barbie, something like that.
you honestly didn't pick fair comparisons. u picked the best bratz and an at best good barbie movie.
Ok, but like why does the Pixie king look like the singer of Scorpions?
It’s like Polly pocket never existed?!?!?!! The best doll. Gosh.
i am slightly and by slightly i mean incredibly offended he CHOSE not to give us a special greeting. i think the fame has finally caught up to him :/ never thought this day would come. absolutely heart brocken💔🥀🔪😞🔫🖤
Balls are great
Unsubscribing due to the lack of extra greeting :(
I really think your perception of bratz and barbie depends on which movies you watch. ESPECIALLY if you're only gonna watch one of each :0
Shave the beard please
Me: (: Kurtis: *no extra greeting* Me: ):
And monster high 😵‍💫
When the "functioning asshole" looks like the flag from Greendale Community College ..... e pluribus anus.
Only virgins don't give our well earned extra greeting to us smh this isn't the fair and good town i joined
I loved both Barbie and Bratz when I was a kid but Kurtis you should have watched Bratz Rock Angels to know the actual main characters where Bratz originated
I was (am) obsessed with bratz rock angelz that album shaped me as an 8 yr old
Should've watched barbie Mariposa😔😔
I enjoyed the barbie movies more than the bratz movies(also barbies get to work pc game) but I found bratz dollz cooler in fashion and personality also genuinely thought the bratz video games were fun.
Is it just me, or does Kurtis seem like he's a bit on edge in this video?
We Stan the ‘Stash 😤😵‍💫
As a monster high kid this video offends me 😪
the inhuman noise i made when i realized you’d be watchin fashion pixies  👹👹👹👹👹
sir take it back, barbie is the most iconic thing ever.
Not giving an extra greeting sounds like something a virgin would do
that DO I WANNA GNOME joke practically killed me this comment is from the other world
Hi kurtis I know this is late but in your gospel for gamers video you mentioned  the flying spaghettis monster i am a member I urge you to read the book and then you will see its not about people believing in the monster its about them pointing out the illogical ideas in many religions.
I read the title as barbie vz barbs as in the dolls vs Nicki Minaj fans, this was a vastly different video
Kurtis now looks like a old sheriff officer in those low budget Wild West cowboy movies
Just saying: I've recently stumbled upon your channel and you make me laugh way more than I should be laughing as I've crippling depression. Stop it. Peace and thanks for your supreme entertainment.
Idk something about Bratz just made it much better than barbie for me...maybe its the style of bratz
I had a stuffed animal Penelope dragon as a kid and that was one of my most favorite toys for a long time. 💜
Barbie’s Repunzel was one of my favorite movies as a kid. I feel attacked by my own mayor.
Is it just me or he seems kinda angry?
stefan and damon
So now we need very really good news.  VRGN.
Dillan is my favorite himbo
No extra greeting?!?!?!? unsubbed and disliked 👎 😡 #Cancelled ☹️whats the point of being subscribed?!?!? 😭 😭 😭
Virgin Really g-Kurtis
HAVE TRIXIE MATTEL ON YOUR PODCAST TO TALK ABOUT BARBIE AND TOYS AND CULTURAL CONNECTIONS AND SHIT
I don't really think this guy is a virgin. He's very clearly secure about that, I mean, just look at how much he says it. It MUST be true.
I don’t think the pulling would hurt Rapunzel if she has enough of it resting on the balcony because then the person is pulling on balcony-resting parts and not her scalp
Oh man not the reused little girl figure in all the barbie movies... mega cursed if you ask me
yo rapunzel is bald now hits hard
holy shit this video made me remember i used to watch bratz movies as a kid AND I WATCHED THIS EXACT ONE
0:34 refund me my tour tickets im shaking and crying i thought i could trust you
Sasha and Jade were my jam!
I have to save this for when I get chipotle tonight so I have something quality to watch while I eat
Oh, hey, hello, hi! hilarious!
use this as a dislike button for kelly
Give us the extra greeting 😡
MyScene dolls were the best imo. They had the perfect head size to stick needles in. Yes, I pierced my dolls. They got tattoos too. XD
These were 2 of my favorite movies when I was little and watching these clips are bringing so much back
How dare you not give us an extra greeting you monster
DUDE MY PARENTS WOULDNT BUY ME BRATZ BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO RISQUÉ
the evil pixie reminds me so much of nancy from the craft movie
I think we need full versions of “Rapunzel is Bald Now” and “Do I Wanna Gnome?”
Dislike for no extra greeting
DUDEE BARBIE RAPUNZEL IS LIKE THE WORST ONEEE WHYD YOU HAFTA PICK THAT ONE
"scrotum scrolls" had me in tears
Sometimes I wonder who’s the original  is it Danny or drew or kurtis
You're walking a really thin ice now, barbies and bratz😤😤🙃🙃😆😔😔👹👹☺🔥💯👏🏻💥💯💯😭😚😏😏😏😏
See Barbie movies were my favorite but barbies were my least favorite dolls, I had a couple bratz but never watched the movies but my god did I love monster high dolls, movies, games, stuffed animals, I had an addiction
My husband & I always wanted to open a BBQ place called "The Greasy Weasel" but now def rethinking the idea of "The Horny Weasel"!!
This was a banger video, definitely worth the 2 week wait.
I liked Bratz fashion pixies so much that I would keep renting it on on demand and I think I spent atleast $100+ renting it over and over before my parents found out
The eboy joke
At this point I don't think Rapunzel has nerves in her hair.
Kurtis said what we were all thinking. The Bratz video game sorta slapped tho, I got to break in to a high class salon in France to fuck up a girl's face like HELL YES
We all needed this
hedwig is a girl >:(
"Headwig when h e" amger
Barbie swan lake is the best
the weasel from barbie as rapunzel is VERY iconic here in brazil bc of his voice actor! it has some iconic lines.   all of barbies movies actually are a strong part of 2000's brazillian culture (bratz are nearly not as popular tho lol)
Horny weasel and scrotum scrolls definitely made my day, so thank you, Kurtis (definitely a sentence I never imagined saying)
2:47 missed the chance to say "poop me in charge"
i refused to play with dolls *lps* is where it's at ok
NO KURTIS YOU HAVE TO PUT SUBTITLES SO I CAN SCREENSHOT THE BEST MOMENTS AND USE THEM AS MEMES
as soon as he said, "bratz fashion pixiez" i open-mouth gasped, and ran to get my dust-covered dvd copy. watching clips from this movie was a whole nostalgia trip. 5 year old me L I V E D to be cymbeline when she grew up, and i honestly still stand by that.
i think my favorite piece of information is that the weasel’s voice actor also plays goku in dbz
#cancelkurtisconnerfornotdoingtheextragreeding
What was the fucking point of subscribing if you're not going to give an extra greeting? That extra greeting is the ONLY reason why I subscribed.
0:38 looks like Somebody watched bo burnham’s “INSIDE”
DUDE I LOVED FASHION PIXIES SO MUCH
I got my vaccine today and I'm pretty sure this video feels like a fever dream without being sick already so this is literally just a fever nightmare for me 🥲
The bratz movies were genuine cinematic masterpieces
Canceled.
Barbie has the better movies but Bratz has the better dolls
How did he manage to choose the only bratz movie I didn’t see
scrolltums
i just wanted to say we have the same radio clock
where is our extra fretting Kurtis…? #kurtisconnorisoverparty2
greg
that bratz movie was just a straight up acid trip 😭
i laughed too hard at the hedwig joke... i shouldve seen it coming a mile away
only a virgin wouldnt greet us two times just saying
ok so i subscribed for nothing???? i demand an extra greeting kurtis. or im suing. and you are a virgin.
I want him to watch Into The Woods so he can see rapunzel be in pain by someone climbing her hair lmao
I’m disappointed you missed the perfect chance for “scrolltums”
kurtis i can not forgive you on what you have done. "This brings a tear to my eye."
I was NOT expecting the Irish gnome ☠️
Loved this video!! Laughed so much
Bratz was my entire childhood
there's so many good barbie movies, barbie and bratz can both be good. pls look more to modern barbie because the have changed with the times and the diverse barbie dolls are incredible!
Ya hooo da ba yo
Kurtis without the extra greeting im feeling highly compelled to unsubscribed.
KURTIS WHERE IS MY EXTRA GREEEEETTTIINNNNNGGGGGG
ya hooo da ba yo my guy
Bratz movie every 5 seconds- *Naacho Bencho*
Grown man talks about barbie dolls for almost half an hour.  Exactly the shit I signed up for.
The sound of footsteps in barbie movies is the reason we're obsessed with ASMR as a generation and you can fight me but you'd be wrong
It’s like Nicki vs Cardi
If I don’t get an extra greeting at the begging of every video (except for that one time) then what did I subscribe for
Kurtis Penelope didn’t fly up to Rapunzel until the end because she didn’t know how to fly/ was too scared to before. Also I think the brush turned into a paint brush because her parents made it that way (?)
TEAM HANNAH MONTANA
purposefully not giving the extra greeting? IMPEACH HIM 😤😤
I feel as rapunzel is not one of the better Barbie movies and isn’t a fair competition to the fairy bratz movie (bratz really never misses though)
why could they speak to animals in every barbie movie
No extra greeting?? I SUBSCRIBED FOR NOTHING! 😠 jk kurtis town for life. :3
my cousin forced me to watch like this live action bratz movie
kurtis has finally taken control...he has NOT given us our desired extra greeting. we must stand together and fight against the person that we love..my butt cheeks r clenched bc of how FURIOUS i am with him😡 WE MUST ATTACK #kurtisconnerisoverparty   /j
White powder called pixie dust
I’m so glad I have one person who I can listen to talk about actual IMPORTANT debate topics like this. Thank you Kurtis for being that person 😌
bratz is my life..  my entire fashion sense is based of all of the dolls and movies.
The Gnome: ITS MISTER worldwide mr 305 IF you do NOT GIVE me an uppy I will piss all over ya feet.
Now I just want kurtis to react to the barbie songs because some of them go hard lol
the gnome being and speaking irish threw me
12:23 hell nah they put yelena in barbie as rapunzel
such a throwback, yeah I gotta agree that the Bratz content slapped way harder than Barbie, in some ways. I still like both as much though. Some other Barbie movies were better.
#kurtystinkyboiconnerispartyandavirginheiscompletelydoneforcancelkurtyconnernow
Now Kurtis is our toxic boyfriend mayor
VIRGINS are the ones who don't give an extra greeting...
Barbie Wire sounds like the name of an all-female punk rock band
Only virgins don’t give us an extra greeting
Add more dates for your tour!!!! Specially the one in Levittown NY 😂😘😘 plleeeaaasseee I'll give u a second greeting 🥺
No extra greeting? C’mon guys, let’s go watch Danny talk about Takis.
YOU SHOULDVE WATCH 12 DANCING PRINCESSES
Kurtis you can lie all you want but the stache will ALWAYS tell the truth. You ARE a virgin. Only virgins have moustaches
I haven't watched this video yet but every girl I have met who has played with Bratz is lesbian now
Now we know what Kurtis would look like bald.
pls if you dkip the extrz greeting one more time i will die
kurtis plugs his podcast when he's totally having sex
ya hooo da ba yo
Kurtis: doesn’t give an extra greeting 3.2 million people in the comments: and I took that personally        Also, holy mustachios, last time I checked Kurtis had like 1 million subs. 🎉
Why did you pick the worst Barbie movie tho...
Dude when Bratz dropped 9 year old me lost her fucking damn mind bc they were cooler than barbie. Bratz had like, way cooler outfits and stuff.
no extra greeting? unsubscribed.
I watched this Bratz movie when I was a kid but the only thing I remembered about it was Dylan and thats it.
PUT SOME RESPECT ON HEDWIGS NAME
i cannot get over how amazing your mustache is
favorite out of context moments 11:51 20:21 25:02
loved this video!! extremely leather funny
ya hooo da ba yo
God I miss Bratz
bratz fashion pixiez is my favorite movie of all time
Kurtis this whole video feels like a fever dream
If Kurtis doesn’t react the the bratz scary story sleepover… I’m unsubscribing.
uh as someone who has only owned barbies i Stan her for life 🙄
#kurtisconnerisoverparty #kurtisisoverparty
#kurtisconnerisabadmayor
you forgot the scene where the weasel was cookin n shit
* Angry twerking *
Omg the brats movie is supposed to be like about not doing drugs or something. It kinda didn’t really work.
welp time for #kurtisconnerisoverparty to trend again
honestly kurtis, I'm so disappointed with you.. I came here to have an extra gretting and now you're denying me that. So sad rn..
No extra greeting? What am I supposed to do now, Kurtis? How am I supposed to go on now?  Being greeted is all I live for, all I am good at... all my worth is now gone, GONE, whats the point of being alive now? what even is the point of having a Kurtistown citizenship?? I don't know who I am anymore Think of the children, Kurtis! Think of me!!  p.s. Lovely video, keep it up!
fuck both of these. MyScene jammin in jamaica is the highest tier
my sister and I still regularly say "Never release your prisoner with a lying heart" to each other. it's stuck with us for fucking years for some reason
Hedwig is a girl you idiot.
yayyyyyyyyy leave that extra greeting !!
Kurtis…. This video was so freaking funny THANK YOU
I was so excited when you said Bratz Fashion Pixiez bc I was just thinking the other day about how batshit insane that movie is
i feel so dumb. i thought that maybe the vrg symbolized you being a virgo or something 😕💔 sorry king 🙏🏽
8:52 when he said “does owls get h***y?” Why did my mind made me think of Stolas from helluva boss-
good
The reason for this resurgence I feel, is that people who played with Bratz, Monster High, etc. are now old enough to collect. Before that, the only people old enough to remember toys from childhood really only had Barbie.
might've been a better comparison to watch the barbie fairy movie
Petition for Kurtis to watch Princess and the popper because it’s the best Barbie movie for sure
You have taken away our human rights, this will NOT be overlooked🔪
Cmon man you can't compare a midgrade barbie movie and a top teir Bratz movie and call that fair :/ make it a fair fight, watch diamond castle, princess charm school, three musketeers, or 12 dancing princesses. Or starlight adventure, if you wanna go for new age batshit   Edit because I forgot 12 dancing princesses and that's a capital offense
i am leaving a comment you jerk
if Kurtis thinks Kelly is freaky he needs to watch Bratz Kidz Sleepover Adventure. That is actual nightmare fuel
Your stash is screaming Super Troopers.
i feel hjrt with no extra greeting (crys)
Cant unsee bald Kurt
" so you think you can trans"  sounds like a talentshow for people mid-transition.
Kurtis I love you buddy but my life force is genuinely weakened by the lack of extra greeting... Please think of what this means to the citizens 😔
Kurtis we had an agreement.
And you should watch fashion 4 passion or rock angels
both franchises are ugly as shit is all i know
Barbie and Bratz films were my whole childhood, especially Barbie as Rapunzel (it started my love of art). Also, Bratz film soundtracks SLAPPED HARD!!!
I cry-laugh at least once in every kurtis video
the thumb nail has my favourite Bratz movie!!
i can’t be the only one thinking of hisoka every time that weasel talks
Kurts
I was unrightfully REFUSED my extra greeting. I am leaving to cry now
Kurtis
kurtis pitting two bad bitches against each other i see
probably my fav video of urs so far, editing was S tier & the skits too. put weasel on soundboard for pod???
The wood-chipper joke literally made me gag. 10/10
the bratz video game alone give bratz the W.
Kurtis angrily twerking is genuinely terrifying
obsessed with the barbie brand punji pit in the rapunzel movie
I SUBSCRIBED WITH THE PROMISE OF AN EXTRA GREETING MAYOR KURTIS CONNER LIED TO US
Maybe the letters mean vertigo
Listen I support you with or without the extra greeting... yeah I’ll need some therapy and some time to accept it but I support you
Bratz better than barbie 100%
Why Barbie as Rapunzel?? No Princess and the Pauper? Swan Lake? Fairytopia?
this!! this I'm here for
24:47 smh he doesn’t even know about alicorns 🙄 fake fan
I only subscribed to get the extra greeting. Unsubbed now.
Barbie Princess and the Pauper is genuinely good and I still watch it as an adult. The plot is a bit thin but surprisingly dark, there is a transgender cat/dog (with a song to go with him), and all the songs are legitimately good. I unironically like it and you definitely should check it out.
4:05 in their what now? hay day?😃
In conclusion: Monster High rules
I am on a seafood diet. I see food, and I eat it. A balanced diet means a cupcake 🧁🧁 in each hand. The only reason I'm fat is because a tiny body couldn't store all this personality. The more you weight the harder you are to kidnap. Stay safe, eat cake 😋 If you’re not supposed to eat at night, why is there a light bulb in the refrigerator? I'm not shy, I'm holding back my awesomeness so I don't intimidate you. I'm not lazy, I am on energy saving mode 🔋 I'm not clumsy, The floor just hates me, the table and chairs are bullies and the walls get in my way. One advantage of talking to yourself is that you know at least somebody's listening. I don't need a hair stylist, my pillow gives me a new hairstyle every morning. Life is short, smile while you still have teeth 🦷 Don't worry if plan A fails, there are 25 more letters in the alphabet. Sorry for the mean, awful, accurate things I said. Doing nothing is hard, you never know when you're done. A bank 🏦 is a place that will lend you 💰 if you can prove that you don't need it. If you think nobody cares if you're alive, try missing a couple of payments. My wallet is like an onion. When I open it, it makes me cry... A successful man is one who makes more money than his wife can spend. A successful woman is one who can find such a man. Always remember that you're unique. Just like everyone else. The elevator to success is out of order. You’ll have to use the stairs.
we need more barbie content honestly
Dylan carried fashion pixies
This video just hits different knowing that he purposely didn’t do the extra greeting
Pov: you are kurtis's mustache and you secrete mustache sweat
I wasn't allowed to play with Bratz or Monster High as a little girl, so I grew up with Barbie
Has anyone else pointed out that HEDWIG IS A GIRL??
But you should watch Bratz Rock Angelz 💗🖤 they had some bangers there (SO GOOD it's still a banger)
Kurtis the whole reason we subscribed was for the EXTRA GREETING you think we came for the content? I'm very disappointed in you.
Had to dislike cuz it’s missing my gotdamn greeting
bratz has my fav show (close tho bc of the og  life in the dreamhouse) and barbie has my fav movies (I also rly like bratz movies)
Okay, I am hyped that you are talking about Barbie AND picked an iconic old movie. And don't get me wrong, I love Rapunzel, but like.. why Rapunzel? You should have looked at Princess and the Pauper, everyone knows that's the best one, smh🙄
You just need some hair loss and you'd be lookin like Gallagher.
For some reason I got a flashback of the Barbie workout tape I had as a kid and how creepily hilarious it was. Also Jennifer Love Hewitt is in it hahah, here is a bit of it... https://youtu.be/AjxqRJIHuvo
kurtis please give barbie another chance and watch the magic of pegasus
I genuinely didn’t think I’d care THIS much about the fact the Kurtis didn’t give us an extra greeting
barbie and the diamond castle is so inherently homosexual and no one can prove me wrong. two women living in a cottage in the woods selling flowers who REJECT their male love interests multiple times and dance with them at the end and when they have the chance to be princesses and live in a castle with other people and the men they CHOOSE TO GO BACK TO THEIR COTTAGE TOGETHER. NOT TO MENTION THEY CONSTANTLY SING SONGS ABOUT HOW CLOSE THEIR BOND IS AND THE WHOLE PREMISE OF THE FILM IS HOW STRONG THEIR BOND IS AND THEIR MAGIC IS POWERED BY THEIR LOVE FOR EACHOTHER. NOT TO MENTION THEIR DRESSES LITERALLY BEING THE BI AND LESBIAN FLAG.
Kylie Jenner for sure played with Bratz as a kid, and suddenly modern beauty standards make sense
Man you had to choose one of the boring barbie movies :'( also lmao they Re use so many characters esp for the background it's hilarious.
If Kurtis even knew of the existence of the absolute UNIT that is Preminger, Bratz would not have stood a chance
I love watching Mayor Mullet Mustache Man aka Kurtis “Not a Virgin” Conner talk about Barbie and Bratz
why did this man say “Barbie as Rapunzel” for the title. This is probably the funniest thing I’ve seen in weeks.
WHERE THE FUCK IS MY EXTRA GREETING THAT IS ALL I AM HERE FOR
kurtis chose barbie as rapunzel bc he saw that tiktok of the weasel saying “give him to me uuuhahhhh”
Idk about the Bratz movies but the best Barbie movie IMO is Barbie's Princess and the Pauper. 'I Am a Girl Like You' SLAPS
Penelope was too scared to fly high and get Rapunzel out of the castle. That's why the relationship with her father (the bigger dragon who was chained and could only fly around the castle) was falling apart.  I've watched this movie about a dozen times as a kid, it was always on tv.
Get a mustache and YOU THINK YOURE TOO COOL FOR AN EXTRA GREETING
The main reason I don't remember much about this Bratz movie(even if it was one of my favorite) was because of that  fcking gnome.  The way I had flashbacks of me being terrified of gnomes because of him💀💀
I already know that this will be my favorite video just by the title
kurtis picked barbie as rapunzel simply for the horny weasel, he needed a character his audience (and he) could relate to. but you cant distract us from the truth kurtis!! the evidence is damning... kurtis is virgin
I have been waiting for the extra greeting to LEAVE no offense Kurtis but I could tell it was annoying
The audacity of Kurtis to chose one of the best bratz movie, and one of the lower tier Barbie movie … rip
fashion pixies was my favorite 😩
Me, sitting in distress and not knowing what to do without an extra greeting 👁👄👁
I'm new here , but are you related to oompaville somehow?
IIRC the reason Barbie sued Bratz was because the guy who invented Bratz had been working for Mattel when he got the idea, so they were arguing that because of that, the whole Bratz concept actually belonged to them. Obviously it failed because the idea that your employer is the legal owner of thoughts and ideas inside your brain is fucking batshit insane.
im pretty sure with bratz, the dancing and partying is like a euphemism for drugs
I grew up watching Barbie movies, I actually think a lot of them are really good
you should have watched princess charm school
Constant as the stars above, always know that you are loved my dude
If we're not getting a second greeting then what's the point of being subscribed and not having that privilege?we should all just mass unsubscribe because he took away the main right of kurtis town citizens.
Kurtis: I'm in control here Us: haha very funny, now dance 🙂
who else wishes kurtis had reacted to barbie: mermaidia bc that movie was a fucking trip and don’t get me started on BIBBLE
BRATZ ROCK ANGELZ SUPREMACY
i...i didn't get my extra greeting... and ive been a subscriber for 2 years... you cant just take that away from me!!! ive already lost so much!!
the fact that he didnt do barbie as the princess and the pauper and met “preminger” voiced by martin short makes me very upset
ok but what about monster high ?
I am so uncomfortable without the extra greeting, I feel as though I didn't understand the value of it until it was taken away
Feeling betrayed I never got a second greeting 😔✊🏻
Dude I thought Freddie mercury deid
Ye ol' chest of Ball-scrolls
My two childhood favorites! Also so glad you recognized the bratz rave realness 😌
No. No. Kurtis. This is the last straw. How dare you willfully forego the extra greeting. This is absolutely unforgivable
I DONT GET MY EXTRA GREETING?! WHAT AM I EVEN SUBSCRIBED FOR???? UGH, UNSUBSCRIBING!! 😡😡😡
A video on two of the most iconic dolls in herstory!!?  I am so proud to be a part of Kurtis Town.  One of the coolest guys on the internet giving us THE CONTENT we didn't know we NEEDED. I cannot wait till Kurtis is Mayor of planet Earth.
Bratz was more diverse and Barbie was just an inspiration for girls since she had like how many jobs
Bratz live action movie
Watch a fairy secret! It’s so great I died watching it again.  Edit: I made this five months ago and you should still watch it and do it with brats sleepover magic or whatever it’s called
This is insanity but I also love it
It totally stands fir virgin
I believe in monster high supremacy, they have everything both Barbie and bratz have, and more
bratz fashion pixies RAISED me
i used to think the VRG stood for virgo
Respectfully, if your favorite barbie movie was diamond castle then you're prolly gay :/// I said what I said
why did i subscribe if im not gonna get an extra greeting #thisisahatecomment
That was my absolute favourite barbie.. i feel 😪
This has to be one of the funniest videos Kurtis has ever made.
Kurtis reenacting the actor recording the weasel voice had me crying laughing lmao
please please watch and review the netflix reality show Are You The One? it’s set in 2014 and everyone is so stupid and it’s way to easy to make jokes
so happy you posted bestie
Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus is the superior Barbie movie and I will take no other opinions on this.
I thought I was having deja vu when he talked about the vrg thing cause he said all that in his podcast
HELL YEAH NO EXTRA GREETING DO NOT CONFORM TO ARBITRARY STANDARDS
Holy crap those Barbie Books from the 90s/2000s unlocked a memory I forgot I had. I have to buy them again
are we ready to talk about how scary Bratz Super Babyz was?!?!?
Why was the king mad that someone stole his daughter but didnt care about kelly? Wasn't kelly the sister? He just cared about one?
this video was so hectic
Points for the bratz pixie movie but what about the bratz slumber party one? Fucking terrifying
Kurtis the only reason I subscribed was so that I could get the extra greeting 😟
Bratz fashion pixies shaped who I am as a child
Those ball scrawls
23:49 JANIS IAN FROM MEAN GIRLS?!?!
This video actually made me laugh out loud so many times, I love it!!
im unsubscribing then i dont want scammers in my subscription list
the video i didn't know i needed
Can you please do the extra greeting I really like it. Atleast every few videos do it.
The “So no Hed-wig?” joke was dope I laughed Kurtis good job
I WISH YOU WATCHED JAMMIN IN JAMAICA
He owes us two extra greetings in the next video.
Honestly I find bratz hilarious, and not just the movies. The tv show is hilarious, especially when aiden (edit: it’s dylan) is dancing. Whenever he’s dancing I can do the dance with him and i just feel so fun doing the wackest background moves that he does in that one band episode when they went to a performance camp. Obviously there’s more, but I found Barbie engaging with the lowkey lesbian relationships (yes I am, how did you know) in princess and the pauper and the diamond castle, which is like the only two I like, although Bibble takes a strong place in my heart because I always watched the second and third movie of that one trilogy and never the first one….. and the minions are great too That’s all I can really say except the Bratz sleepover gave me nightmares and will continue to do so
#KurtisConnerIsOverParty😔
Can we also talk about the fact that Bratz has some amazing songs?
*WHERE IS OUT EXTRA GREETIN’?*
Unscubcribing because i didnt get an extra greeting
WAIT WHY DO I DRESS LIKE DYLAN-
Hedwig is female. At least in the books and movies. Fanfiction writers can do whatever they want though.  :)
How could you not extra greeting, I subscribed for nothing 😞
Looks like it's time to #cancel Kurtis Conner again. And toy soldiers was the shit.
I feel like a lot of kids who lived in a Mexican household played mostly with Bratz cause there was more characters to relate to
I haven't even watched the video yet but today has been so terrible and I just woke up from a nap and saw that you uploaded so now im in a better mood thanks ily
No greeting. Not watching.
hi kurtis :> i sent this to u on instagram knowing you wouldn’t see it nd i’m gonna put it here bc maaaybe you’ll see it? i dunno haha!  - i have a question, and it is this: would you ever include zip up hoodies in a merch drop?  i absolutely adore your merch, it’s always designed super well and embodies your swaggy vibes! i would like to adorn myself in kurtis swag, and the piece i like the most from the kowboy merch is definitely the hoodie. the design is so fucking cool and i wanna wear it every day, but i can’t really wear drawstring hoodies.  (this happens a lot! oftentimes the piece of merch i’m most drawn to is a hoodie bc they typically have the coolest designs)  they send me into overstim a lot, which isn’t anyone’s fault, i just can’t wear them- which makes me hesitant about buying them. this is super unfortunate though bc,, the hoodie design is so swag.  i usually feel way better in zip up hoodies because they’re open in the front and less overwhelming (not to mention easier to take off if i start freaking out)!  i get that you probably don’t have a huge demand for zip up hoodies, and it may not be something you’d wanna make (or it’s difficult, etc) and that’s totally ok! it’s your merch and i completely respect that. i just wanted to ask heheh  if you ever see this, thank you for your time!
kurtis is an absolute baddie for making a video about barbies vs. bratz
I am 22 years old. I'd still buy a Bratz doll :))))
the pet weasel has haunted my dreams for 21 years
ya hooo da ba yo
I REMEMBER THIS BRATZ MOVIE AAAHHHHH I absolutely love Bratz movies
NO THE EXTRA GREETING
You should do a part 2 around the holidays and compare their Christmas movies
what’s the point of subbing when i don’t get my extra greeting
I subscribed for the extra greeting…. Do I unsubscribe now?…
Well, I never liked Barbie, but I HATE the way Bratz looks like. Yeeaah, Kelly is creepy... but this whole Bratz thing was so much creepier (°__°)
Sorry...the beginning was funny AF 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
The FIRST new video after I subscribe and I don't even get an extra greeting???
I grew up watching the barbie movies, didn't play with barbies. Played with Bratz, hadn't seen any of the movies. Started this vid like "no way is anything gonna beat Barbie movies" but clubbing pixies??? fuck YES
Hedwig do be a gal tho, yeeyee.
BRING BACK EVER AFTER HIGH MATTEL SUE DISNEY
ya hooo da ba yo
You better choose Barbie or else
I CANT BELIEVE THIS. YOU DIDN't GIVE A EXXTRA GREETING!!!!!!
ARCTIC MONKEYS KURTIS 😫
I love Bratz, but the Barbie movies are Sapphic as fuck and I love that even more ✂️❤💖🧡
“Rapunzel is bald now”  holy shit that’s fucking hilarious
Bless you
Very really good more like virgin really good ahahahh😌
FINALLY SOMEONE REMEMBERS CHALKZONE
I have been trying to find that bradz movie for so long! Now I finally know the name of it.
Unsubscribed, till i get my extra greetings
kelly was scary af, why did she have such a bigforehead
no extra greeting? Wow, that's *bold* move, Mayor!
"rapunzel is bald now" is the funniest bit you've ever done
Should've reached to Bratz Rock Angels... mistakes were made
10:59 I don’t think I want to know what the weasel was planning to do with the rabbit
He's right, once you've seen the horny weasel, you can't forget about him
The real truth is that Kurtis is a virgin and he just couldn’t fit the other letters on the shelf-
I feel so unwelcome without that extra greeting. What the heck Kurtis. You owe us 3 extra greetings for this.
no bring the extra greeting back because we will mass unsubscribe because there is no benefits to staying anymore
"I'm gonna piss on you"  Funniest shit I have ever heard
Sigourney Weaver should’ve won horniest beaver 😤😤
#kurtisconnerisoverparty  You know what to do folks
master mullet man
I can't believe this wasnt barbie fairytopia, the one superior barbie movie...........
The fact that he chose my favorite Barbie movie and my favorite bratz movie 💕💕😎
Only a virgin would refuse to do an extra greeting
Barbie> Bratz. and yes im just saying that cause i like period fantasy and i watched barbie as a kid lol
Not giving an extra greeting is a really virgin move
Who in the world thinks kurtis is verging?! The moustache obviously says otherwise 👨
We won't just let Kurtis break the laws of Kurtis town. We demand our basic rights for an extra greeting!✊
Now it’s gonna be Bratz Vs Monster High 😈😈
Fun fact: Almost every Barbie movie was animated by Mainframe Entertainment, the team behind ReBoot.
I didn’t want the bratz Dolls when they came out bc I thought the giant heads were weird expecially next to all the like dozens of barbies I already had so might as well stick to Barbie at that point lol and my dad said bratz proportions were freaky when I got older lol
I used to watch the ruppunzzul movie with my mom lol.   How do you spell ruppunzzel
“do i want to gnome” made me fucking cry of laughter. i don’t know if i should be ashamed or not. help
.... i am unsubscrivbe give me gweeting
Cancel Kurtis 2021 for no extra greeting!!!!!!
Ya hoo dad ba yoo
There’s some good Barbie movies but personally I feel like as a kid I loved Bratz movies a lot more.
Yo guys, is it me or does not doing the extra greeting seem like something a virgin would do...
Where's the EP of Rapunzel is Bald Now
KURTIS there is a BLACK... EMPTY... void in my heart just cause you didn't do your extra greeting. YOU DIDNT DO ON AT ALL
28:48 bless you Kurtis
There he go, putting two bad bad bitches against each other
Petition for kurtis to make parody do I wanna gnome
Why didn’t you pick one of the best Barbie movies??? Like Barbie in the Nutcracker or Princess and the Pauper. Even just putting aside plots, characters, music, etc. at least all the characters looked like they came from the same universe in the Barbie movies! The stark difference in character design and shape between Bratz doll characters and their grown ups was freaky and weird Edit typo
I used to have a Stephen doll that had a button on his back. If you pressed it her would say RAPUNZEL RAPUNZEL let DOWN YOUR haIr.
You and Danny have fully synced your cycles
Very into the meme-y reclamation of autonomy in the first 40 seconds
kurtis boy… you chose the worst barbie movie to watch
Kurtis: i’m not a virgin.  also Kurtis: *Talks about Barbies*
There's a live action Bratz movie that absolutely sucks on the US Netflix.
where is my extra greeting ? dislike
the bratz “EWWWWW” always gets me
the fact that kurtis didnt review barbie princess and the pauper is a CRIME
I can't believe Kurtis made a podcast just to hide the fact that he's a virgin
they're both good why put two powerful girl groups against each other?
I used to love this movie, uh I don’t remember the weasel being a fucking creep
Wow Kurtis, no extra greeting? I don’t know about that🖐🏻😪
The things people did with the BTS Mattel dolls on like tik tok are just….cursed Lmfaooo
Finally someone brave enough to address real issues
“i’m not a virgin” sounds like something a virgin would say 😌
GIVE ME THE EXTRA GREATING NOWWWWWWWW
Kurtis didn't give me my extra greeting so I will now be unsubscribing from his channel permanently. #kurtisconnorisoverparty
Pls watch Barbie starlight adventure it’s the best film I’ve ever seen
"Doth thou carpet match thy drapes?" HAHHAHHAHAHA
Rapunzel and the Nutcracker were my absolute favourite Barbie movies when I was a kid
I love that Kurtis covers random topics like this and doesn’t just stick to one specific genre of video. I literally never know what I’m gonna get when I click on his videos but I almost always learn something new and laugh my ass off while doing it. Thank you kurtis!
e pluribus anus 2:52
iremember my little sister watching these xD
I have never laughed harder at a video. I forgive you for not giving an extra greeting
actually, they're called alicorns kurty boy. learn your pony knowledge.
polly pocket lunar eclipse movie wins
Na both suck, let's talk bout  M o n s t e r h i g h
i love this
kurtis getting scared of the children in barbie rapunzel LMAOOO 😭😭
no extra greeting on purpose this time? guys, its time to riot >:)
Virgins give only one greeting and that's a fact....
ya hoo da ba yo
Respectfully, never not do the greeting again, Kurt
I can't speak for all little girls, but little girl me never thought I should look like a barbie because I wasn't think about proportions. When I found out that it is impossible to have the same proportions, I said "guess I won't, then" and it didn't matter because everyone still looked normal to me.
I subbed just to get the extra greeting. My life has no meaning anymore.
kurtis i really needed that extra greeting today i’m unsubscribing i’m so mad i don’t even want to laugh at your jokes
I'm sorry, but when barbie's hair got cut wtf how is her hair doing that.
only a virgin would take away our extra greetings >:(
I remember wanting these movies so bad, and instead I got stuck with the Max Steel Elementor free DVD that came with the cereal. Honestly, though, not complaining anymore.
I understood about 20% of what the gnome(s?) said
You fool, I shall fuse monster high with Bionicle to beat them all
Honestly, I loved barbie and bratz movies! 😍 Also i had the barbie rapunzel doll and it was awesome. Her hair retracted and everything
8:05 borderlands 4 barbie edition
I actually have the brats movie on dvd ._.
i love how some of the pixies have pixie cuts
Bratz were suer popular in uk, Chav look is also popular in uk. you think those girls grew up watching bratz?
The correct answer is monster high
This is so unrealistic, we all know James Franco would win the horny weasel award.
No but a Virgin has a stash like that bro
Can we talk about how mh is better?
this is the funniest non feature video of kurtis i’ve ever seen
Scrotum Scrolls?  Scrollums?
HE DISINT DO THE EXTRA GREETINGN IM UNSUBSCRIBINT
oh hi kurtis
KURTIS YOUVE HOODWINKED US HOW DARE YOU I AM HURT I FEEL BAMBOOZLED
Hi   cheesy man.
ur hair looks so good mr. mayor
My childhood was the movie ''bratz super babies''   Thats shit was weird
Without the greeting the supp is not worth anymore
Kurtis “you cant just sue people you don’t like”  ... ye....yea you can, you’ll probably lose but you definitely can
GIVE ME MY EXTRA GREETING YOU COWARD!! I’M LITERALLY SHITTING, FARTING AND PISSING IM SO ANGRY!!
**angry twerking**
touche
I literally hated that he didn't do an extra greetinf
funny how he paused for a ‘snack’ break i.e merch ad... he knows full well we all already got snackies for this one 🤓
You know what? I AM what I create!
Not me literally rewatching Bratz Fashion Pixies the other day to relive my childhood
Screw you and your virgin sign #kurtisconnerisoverparty
So true king,  Bratz > everything
Me going straight to Kurtis from Dannys vid
I kinda like the *no extra greeting* era tho-
barbie in rapunzel was a TOP TIER FILM
THE GIRL ANGRILY TWEARKING IN THE CLUB SCENE  I'M FUCKING CRYING
The way I have LITERALLY been revisiting my childhood by watching old Bratz and Barbies movies this week  Edit: THE MOVIE I WATCHED WAS LITERALLY BRATZ FASHION PIXIEZ OMG
Him deciding to make a joke about balls literally almost killed me...I choked laugh while eating chips and salsa T-T
kurtis not giving us and extra greeting was SERIOUSLY intense
4/10????? apology video NOW I will not stand for this barbie slander
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO u went to the best bratz movie but a b tier barbie movie 💔💔💔
Barbie as Princess and the Pauper is the shit tho
Kurtis: *shows Barbie horse adventures*  Me: *instantly hit by an intense wave of nostalgia for simpler times*        🥲
KURTY FOR THE WIN
That Irish gnome is…. Honestly better than some Irish movie characters I’ve seen
HE BETTER MAKE ANOTHER APOLOGY VIDEO FOR NOT GIVING US AN EXTRA GREETING
Please bring back our greeting. We are so sorry we called you a virgin🥺   *fucking virgin energy right guys?*
The mother as a tree for 10+ years gives me Thalia Grace vibes 👀 👀 👀 👀
I feel lost and confused that my Mayor didn’t double greet me on purpose
love the video tho!!
Yay I'm so happy you uploaded... I recently found your channel and already watched every. single. video of yours already and I was patiently waiting for a new one!!
ngl i rly loved Tangled and always wondered why i didn't like the Barbie Rapunzel movie as a kid and heard the sound the weasel made and cackled relentlessly for a solid 5 minutes
okay but barbie songs are so iconic <3
WHY NO EXTRA GREETING?!!?!??!?!? MUST CANCEL
My extra greeting privileges have been removed :(
I liked this video just so Kelly can fall into a hole
The bratz music was just 👌. They all slap. Every time.
youre fucking canceled again dude
You gotta pay the troll toll to get into this gnome's hole
If you're a fan of Barbie, I have an in depth podcast series going over the entire history! <3 it would mean the world to me if y'all checked it out!!
A real horror movie is the Bratz slumber party movie
ya hooo da ba yo
Wood chipper? I hardly know her
ya hooo da ba yo
Barbie movies are like my favourite genre of so bad its good movies the absolute BEST for anyone who wants to watch one is the Princess and the Pauper one. my GOD the villian is so funny and everything is just so awkward and funny. also, THE MUSIC its actually catchy as hell lmao.
The barbie movies were golden, perfect for a feel good/ comfort night. And bratz movies were best for lazy days n laughs cause imo they had more personality. Expect for the love action,,, fuck that shit. OH AND DOES ANYONE REMEMBER MY SCENE HOLY SHIT THE WEBSITE WAS SO GOOD I MISS IT
kurtis reviewing my childhood?? love to see it
Bruh, the extra greeting...
Love this so much Kurtis thanks for not just endlessly trashing on the movies!!!! Also, you picked great movies for each of them! Glad you called out that freaking weasel lmao. I was worried when I saw the video title, thinking it would be a bunch of cheap shots at people who grew up loving these movies. Very pleasantly surprised! There's definitely plenty to joke about in them and I'm so glad you did it in a good-natured way! Awesome video! :)   (also it's valid if you want to distance yourself from the extra greeting lol)
kurtis /neg can you believe he didn't give me my extra greeting? do you know how offensive that is? i subscribed just to get my extra greeting, i spent a whole TWO SECONDS on subbing and he doesn't even deliver what i was promised. he lied. i will NOT be supporting him he's to controversial.
Kurtis says he isn’t a virgin  But I’m yet to see a Virgin and Kurtis in the same room
What the fuck Kurtis, I am BEYOND hurt. You promised.
GIVE ME MY SPECIAL GREETING OR ELSE I. 😡😡🤬🤬
Barbie is the President. Bratz are the Supreme Court.
Barbie ads say “you can be anything”, but I’ve never seen a YouTuber Barbie or a Barbie that uses pancakes to defeat aliens that want to turn the moon into a cube.
I remember watching Barbie as rapunzel when I was 5. It was very entertaining for a boy.
7:52- why is her waist THAT small?
without an extra greeting the video is sad kurt how could our mayor do such a thing
If this video doesn’t end with bratz as superior I will become jaded
Kurtis not doing the standard opening with dual welcomes is the most insane thing I’ve seen this year
I have big lips and eyes I loved bratz 😂😂😂😂😂😂💜
As a young black girl I exclusively collected Bratz solely because of color options and fashion
You should make a video about Escape to Witch Mountain. It’s the best worst thing ever.
Can someone send me a link to his confused sound bite?
Barbie as Rapunzel was one of my favorite movies as a kid! So glad you're talking about it.
that fucking edit of Barbie says BALLS with the echo is so fucking funny
Imagine being able to spell Curtis Connor correctly
I like how in the Barbie movie they couldn't magically make a ladder appear for her to get out the window or make her fly, but they could make a magic brush that creates new universes on the spot
I- I suddenly feel compelled to not be subscribed! What is it all for! I didn’t get validated by an extra greeting 😭😭😜😭😭
3:40 Kurtis turning into Garfield
im jealous of kurtboy's mullet, mine could never
I mean her hair might hurt to be pulled on...but it is magic I guess.
Funniest Kurtis video yet, keep it up Mr. Mayor!
Kurtis reviewing my favourite Barbie and Bratz movie is not something I thought I would need in my life but here we are.
He didn't say the extra greeting, I am shaking and crying rn THIS IS NOT YOU KURTIS.
Kurtis, please add barbie saying balls to your podcast sound board🙏 it is all I want in life
canceled again smh
#kurtis is over party😑
Kurtis please where is the extra greeting
I played with barbies as a kid but the bratz movie puts the barbie movie to shame for sure.  Also for other people who played with barbies who else used sharpies to give them tattoos? I colored in ken's teeth so it looked like he only had one and gave my barbie doll prision/sailor tats when I put her in jail aka the baby doll crib ah good memories
YES MY CHILDHOOD
I grew up on Barbie is repunzal and this resurfaced thousands of forgotten memories
I think that guy forgot to wash his face. Got we poo poo under his nose.
Bratz also has the first lgbtq+ couple!
That knock off Arthur theme song omg.
idk Bratz looks like the type of girl that would cheat on you but that’s just me
I died when I saw he’s going over the  Rapunzel one , what an og movie loll
okay, so barbie and bratz slap but like... monster high tho
18:59 LMAO
Dang Barbie’s waist is snatched to the gods, dude grabbed it like a frickin big gulp
We’re canceling Curtis Connor again OK
Of course Bratz is superior! You should watch a myscene movie next lolol
Okay but.. ✨Monster high✨ . . . Ok but as a doll collector.. YES!
I for one fully support phasing out the extra greeting. It was feeling a bit forced anyways and it felt like you didn't enjoy it anymore
Dude as soon as I saw the Barbie movie cover I got flashbacks to the weasel...  P.s Ya hooo da ba yo
FINALLY NOT AN EXTRA GREATING!!!!!!!!!
I feel so unloved without the extra greeting🥱😒
dare I say it, the pixie king??? kind of a dilf……
I'm so fucking glad this video is on the internet it made me laugh so so fuckin hard dude
We need to storm kurtis town and steal as many toilet paper rolls as we can, the extra greeting will be restored
the king has come back to reclaim his throne
I heard you posted the video. AND I'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR THIS TO SHOW UP FOR THE LAST HALF HOUR.
My 18 year old dumbass still watches barbie movies
Bratz n barbie were my childhood that's why I'm a bad bitch rn <3 <3
I’m not feeling like a very valued member of kurtistown 😔
I never played with Barbie only Bratz and I saw the bratz movies and series
KURTIS CAN U PLS DO A VIDEO ON SHIFTING PLSPLS
Wow early barbie movies and Oblivion have the same animation vibes
I just thought you liked VR games lol
It’s interesting to see the discussion of Barbie from a dude
Finally we do an actual intelligent smart convo
HAIR & MUSTACHE LOOKS GREAT MIGHT I ADD
the reverberation of the word "balls" lasts just an awkward second too long and it makes me very uncomfortable
petition for kurtis to release a full version of “rapunzel is bald now” 😩🤞
i'm hurt that i didn't get an extra greeting; it's literally the only reason i subscribed :(
I watched fashion pixiez for the first time while tripping on shrooms. Gotta say it’s wild
Bratz for the win
Considering I'm Irish the gnome scene was extra scary because we are from the same birthplace
the classic barbie movies are so artistic and then you have bratz... a wtf funny mess
Barbie movies where the shit
when you were a barbie and bratz stan when you were little.... well this is a little awkward
I have never clicked on a video so fast
as someone named dylan this hurts
Kurtis please i beg of you, please watch more barbie movies
Kurtis ruining my childhood for 28:49 minutes
Omg hi
VRG= very really gay= me
We all know you made the podcast after the virgin comments smh good try for a cover up tho
As a doll collector, I feel so already in on all the doll drama watching this 💀💀   Also >:c NO EXTRA GREETING!?!?!?!?
somebody make a fancam for the end of the extra greeting era
This angry twerk made me laugh so hard my baby woke up
I subscribed last video so I could get an extra greeting every new upload  My disappointment is immeasurable
“Every movie needs a h***y weasel” So that’s why Harry Potter has Ron
i- NO EXTRAGREETING?
finally some good fucking content
barbie has better movies, bratz had better styling and dolls
I hope Kurtis puts 7:24 “oh my god it’s fucking kelly” on his sound board
you need to react to the myscene movie jammin in jamaica you’d lose your mind it’s free on youtube
Talking about the real shit that matters!!!!!
Not Kurtis choosing literally the worst barbie movie
monster high is superior anyways </3
We watched him going from a countryboy to a Barbie loving (non) virgin
I’m literally screaming how could he not give an extra greeting?? What is the purpose of subscribing to the channel if I don’t get that extra greeting???
I didn't realize Bratz came out in 2001. My name is Yasmin and i was born in 2001... Am i a Bratz doll!?     Srsly tho, that Yasmin Bratz doll is the only place in 'mainstream' media I've found my name in the exact same spelling (at least until Yasmin from doctor who)
you didnt watch the good barbie movies you cant say that na-HA!!!😑
barbie is basic and bratz are chaotic hot mess
I had bratz when I was younger at the time it as the only way to easily get a black or Asian doll so my family bought boatloads for the kids in my family, and also monster high
gotta unsub what’s the point if you don’t get an extra greeting
Voice actor: Oh allow me mistress mmhhhhh Newbie intern: Oh I didn't know we were making THAT type of movie
I feel like Kurtis is preparing for a Nacho Libre Halloween costume but overshot how long it would take to get the right look
Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. ~What Kurtis will learn very soon
Kurtis's mustashe looks seriously intense
Where is my promised extra greeting?! I want to speak with the manager!
Kurtis is a Barbie boy in a Barbie world
I wasnt allowed to have a Bratz doll🥺
Anyone else hear Kurtis’ phone go off?
Really thrown by that gnome not only having a very Irish accent but also speaking some Irish Gaelic??
Barbie swan lake was my SHIT back in the day, but looking back at the graphics now is wack
The angry Irish gnome caught me so off guard wtf
I can’t imagine that someone with a podcast called “Very Really Good” could EVER be a virgin
danve. dance.
What about Monster High??? But the old version!! The new one sucks in my opinion
Arguably, Kurtis chose one of the worst barbie movies to review. There are a ton of others that are way bettwr
I think the day Kurtis shaves his stache is the day the world ends, y'all should be thanking him for not shaving it tbh🙏🙏
Barbie movies were my childhood and I gotta say, they still make me smile.
no extra greeting? time to die
VIRGIN?1?1?1??1?????????
What about My Scene dolls? For me they were the perfect mix between Barbie and Bratz. I think they were introduced one year after Bratz to compete with them and honestly I loved them. Their movies were awsome too, full of drama and definitely more mature. I hope that Kurtis will react to them as well, so this comparison feels more complete.
KELLY IS JOJO SIWA 😭😭
Oh shit.
BRUUHHH you should have watched Barbie princess and the pauper that's the BEST one. The soundtrack is KILLER
how dare you break your promise of an extra greeting every video, this is not what i signed up for
if you vote me as the new mayor of kurtistown i GUARANTEE an extra greeting at the beginning of EVERY SINGLE one of these videos.
wow- I loved this, thank you 🤣💀
shut up the no music scene was asmr to my 6 y/o self
You know what, good for you. You started a thing and you decided that thing is no longer what you want to do. I WILL survive without my extra greeting.
If I was a gnome I would be pissed
Ahh yes, Kurtis’ podcast “Ery Eally Ood”, love that one
Cancell again
kurtis is the only youtuber that can actually make me laugh.
you're giving me some yee-yee vibes in this vid brother
That beginning had me laughing so hard  Well guess we know he’s not a virgin now. Ty kurtis
i audibly laughed out loud at work to this video many times... lets just say my boss is not happy.
Kurtis looks like extra cute today?? i can't stop staring at him, I'm sorry I'm gonna have to rewatch it
How dare you not give us our extra greeting😤
Just saying rapunzel could wrap her hair around something to transfer the load when someone tries to climb it
What’s the point of even subscribing if not for the extra greeting? ;-; kurtis whyyy
This was legit the funniest video i have ever watched kurt. i was literally on the floor crying, thank you
This made me laugh so much, honestly thank you
This is weird but that weasel reminds me of my dog…
why was the gnome irish and why didnt curtis say anything?
I knew it was "very really good" but the V being slightly crooked has always bothered me 😂
//tw: puke   fun fact: me and my sister loved the barbie rapunzel movie and she had a stuffed animal of penelope. one time my parents had guests over and i didn’t feel good so i hid in the playroom and laid under the couch, but only my head; so from shoulders down you could see me on the floor. i puked laying down facing up and it went everywhere, all over my face, and the stuffed animal was under  there too so it got covered. a little bit later my mom came to check on me and brought me a piece of cake. she pulled me from under the couch and screamed. we had to throw away the penelope stuffed animal. my sister still holds a grudge. i think i was like 4-6 years old
#kurtisisoverparty
#kurtisisoverpary😤😤
ya hooo da ba yo
Lalaloopsy > every other doll franchise
bratz dolls made me gay
Barbie as rapunzel is a classic, I remember every part of this movie I watched it so much lmao, the sounds, the animation, everything is so nostalgic. Same with the twin sisters one with Barbie and Teresa 😂 I watched those two a lot
Grown men talking about Barbie always makes my day.
no extra greeting? sounds like something virgin Kurtis would do
This video legit has a special place in my heart lmaoo( ಠ◡ಠ )💕
I just watched Kurtis rip into my favorite childhood Barbie movie...and thoroughly enjoyed it
Barbie is so much better than Bratz
I thought it said virgo
Am I the only one who can smell a Bratz doll when I see a picture of one???
Best barbie movie - barbie and the twelve dancing princesses
I feel not so special now after not getting an extra greeting
bratz starrin and stylin and rock angels superior
KURTIS YOU NEED TO REVIEW THE MONSTAR HIGH MOVIES PLSSSSSS
(Hedwig is a she though)
Nobody with a mullet that sick could stay a virgin very long. Also, neither. Monster High have the best clothes.
Watch the shows now
Barbie as Repunzel was my favourite Barbie movie as a kid. I used to love both Barbie and Bratz! though the Bratz were always a lot more sassy and rude than the Barbies
This video is chaotic
No extra greeting… how many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man? #KurtisConnerIsOverParty
18:44 I LOVE YOU FOR THIS DON'T APOLOGIZE
me painting bibble's face all over a butterfly hutch while watching this
Kurtis is the perfect person to watch when ✨🍃intoxicated🍃✨
Thank you for picking Barbie Rapunzel! I loved it as a kid and played the PC game too. This brought back great memories!
Also wrt hydrant gnomes... do they LIKE being pissed on by dogs??
This is going to be good.
Finally found out where the “give him to me” meme came from
Alotttt of these bratz characters were scene kidz from before the monster high girls ☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾
We not gonna talked about how bald Kurtis.
the extra greeting scandal will come back, kurtis🙄
"Long ass hair" um...phrasing
The nostalgia omg
hi kurtis
Here you go. In case you need an extra greeting today.  And if you're coming back, what's up. how's it goin'? It's really good to see you again. I hope you're doing well.
shoutout to kurtis for knowing his target audience a little too accurately
No extra greeting 😔
this video gives me so much joy
Where the fuck is my extra greeting?
Kurtis needs to be sponsored by Mattel
Am I the only one who thinks they absolutely copied Spyro's design for that purple dragon?
I totally believe this guy is NOT a virgin!!!
No. Kurtis give us the extra greeting now.
barbie as rapunzel was one of my favorite movies as a child.  I had the barbie-figures for the movies :D
Wowow
Kurtis Conner, Danny Gonzalez and Scott Cramer all posting on the same day? What have we done to deserve such a gift
lovely apology video
bratz had better diversity and outfits but barbie movies SLAPPED
Kurtis review opened my eyes and now I've a very different educated opinion.
He looks like he'd ask you to get in the back of his van
I stopped watching the second I realised I was not getting an extra greeting. I-I just can’t
Poor Kelly
Woah I didn’t even know I had seen Barbie as repunzel but that unlocked a deep memory lmao
this video made me laugh sm
I am personally a huge Bratz fan, I love Barbie too, but Bratz is fucking dope. My favorite Bratz movie has got to be Rock Angelz though lmao
I was promised an extra greeting in every video upon subscribing many moons ago. why bamboozle me twice, mayor?
not kellyyy
i fucking love fashion pixies
Now, react to Bratz: Rock Angelz, you coward.
Yo what kind of lip parasite do have Kurtis
aaron and jo are quaking
Barbie as Repunzel X Donkey Skin
Barbie? I hardly know her
Why are you looking like a mexican immigrant?
I am now convinced kurtis is the funniest person ever
I have to say. I had a dream I was good buddies with Kurtis. We were having fun just hanging around before I said, "Wait a minute, you're the cow!" All of a sudden his eyes and mouth shrank and he smiled, and started repeating "focking moo." And I was happily going, "he's the cow, man!" And then as soon as I woke up, he uploaded.
Kurtis. I want my extra greeting. I subscribed for something and you gave me nothing.
wait until he sees the monkey from 12 dancing princesses.
What do u call a bee that works at a bar? Barbie. Exactly we live in a simulation
sighorny Weasel is right there
The extra greeting is goneee! 😯
unsubscribing because i dont feel represented in the extra gretting community. do better.
the as*hole is from the community flag and THAT'S attention to detail!
Bless you
I COULDNT BREATHE WHEN KELLY FELL IN 😭 I loved this <3
This video went exactly the way I expected
I REMEMBER CHALKZONE !! I REMEMBER CHALKZONE
The mom says "never let go" and the song says "just let go now"
I really want the kurtistown kowboys hoodie but it’s 701 swedish kr😔✨
UNSUBSCRIBED BECAUSE I DIDN'T GET MY EXTRA GREETING
Transition: B a l l s... You should hide your money better than gothel hides her scrotum scrolls so, check out our sponsor-
thanks kurtis, i'm gonna see kelly and her big ass forehead in my nightmares now
"His backpack was stolen by a crow" kaz brekker, is that you?
Ytwok?
A+ content!!! I was laughing so hard about that darn weasel! 😂
Kurtis watching Barbie and Bratz movies AND making an Arctic Monkey’s gnome reference... I’m in heaven ❤️
looking back, watching that bratz movie was probably a gay awakening or smth of mine
Bratz was actually prototyped using barbie PIECES from a worker who used to work at Mattel. That's why they sued! It's an interesting case of who owns IP when you work for a company tbh
<3
Kurtis, never stop angry twerking.
Did Kurtis steal Drew’s Kim Possible wig?
Watching this in public fully being stared at for laughing so much. The jokes are 10/10 in this one
The blasphemy of calling Pegasi "flying unicorns"
i was and will forever be a bratz doll girl, i always chose bratz dolls, my favorite movie is the bratz babies movie BUT Barbie Princess and the Pauper has my heart forever and always
not me starting to like kurtis' moustache
Unsubscribing did not get what I signed up for, where is my extra greeting, I am very upset
i’m unsubscribing. what the fuck is the point if i don’t get greeted excessively
this is such a weird thing that you are talking about since, it’s like a huge part of my life, kinda shitting balls rn
omg noooo vrg in spanish is a short way to write a cursed word JAJAJAJA
yk when Kurtis uploads the same day Danny does, they gonna be good.
Love the stache
Unsubbing, but I'll keep watching. Should've greeted me a second time asshole
I love how much Kurtis despises the children in the barbie movie
You guys if you also thought that rapunzels hair would like snap her neck you should watch the field theory episode on it it’s really interesting
I didn't know Trevor Phillips had a YouTube channel!!
ya hooo da ba yo
Fuck you kurtis I worked hard pressing the sub button to earn my extra greeting with every video! You're gonna get SLAPPED by legal once I draw up this lawsuit!
barbra
0:29 On behalf of the Time Variance Authority I hereby arrest you for crimes against the Sacred Timeline
cancelled for no extra greeting. send him to stan twitter.
i am Dillon
NO EXTRA GREETING?! REPORTED
Just got a poop ad before kurtis' video. just thought I'd share.
What am I even subscribed for if I don’t get an extra greeting? 😔
“Do i wanna gnome” made me laugh so hard i almost fell out Keep it up king i love your puns
I used to fear bratz dolls. Now I fear the Bratz films
I'm at work so can't watch this video yet but I HAD TO COME HERE JUST TO SAY holy smokes check out the Bratz instagram, they go so f*****g hard and are always showcasing awesome humans like SOPHIE and Aaron Philip... so I'm coming into this debate heavily biased. ok bye
if I'm not gonna get my god damn extra greeting, you're gonna lose your god damn favorite subscriber 😤
Jokes on you Kurtis. it just so happens to be Opposite Day ,so you are a virgin.nerd.
immediately liked the vid bc I respect u taking control into u own hands
penelope is scared of flying, dont give her a cinema sins ding for that
Now do monster high
9:05 I wanna smash my fucking head to the wall
1:39 that is so haunting i hate it
18:42 Bo Burnham: Inside (2021) - Short Version
But Kurtis.... I only just recently subscribed... yes I'm an adult, and didn't pay any money... but I feel robbed.
they killed of kelly and brought in chealsy
The disrespect in this video. Im offended. And ONE DAY AWAY FROM JUNETEENTH. WOW KURTIS ANTI-BLACK MUCH?!?!?!????
CANCEL KURTIS FOR NOT INCLUDING THE EXTRA GREETING 🗣🗣 WHAT DO WE WANT? EXTRA GREETINGS. WHEN DO WE WANT THEM? NOW.
Actually kinda hurt I didn't get my extra greeting. 😕
i don’t know if i could ever forgive you for that AM gnome joke. so disappointed 😕
“I’M gANna piSS uhN yAoU” (21:27)
Jenny Nicholson, who has worked on a Barbie video for month, is throwing Bibbles right now.
Hello Kurtis. Hello Kurtis great to see you again
You know it’s a good day when kurtis uploads            He didn’t say a extra greeting what did I subscribe for then
read a story once where rapunzel does the hair thing but bc of the force and weight of her hair she breaks her neck and dies
WHAT JUST HAPPENED WHY WOULDN'T I GET AN EXTRA GREETING
this video was so funny omg made my week 😏
Love the do I wanna know thing 😭🤚
#kurtisconnorisoverparty
KURTIS, IM BETRAYED WHERE IS MY EXTRA GREETING?????
I think the rebrand of Barbie is also pretty brilliant especially with Barbie “vlogs” talking about mental health and racism. Also making their dolls different shapes and heights
THE GNOME AHHHHHHGHH
funny how "the pixie world" that lives amongst the normal human looks like a workd if you snorted the snow
Unsubbing. Didn't give me my extra greeting smh /j
bratz for the win
i never realised how bad the early barbie movies were (quality wise, i used to love them in kindergarten). the barbie characters look like sims 2 people but worse.
I came back from making my snack and the video was over :(
Barbie all day
Anyone else's parents think Bratz were too 'mature' so they got Moxie Girlz instead? Just me??
Hey guys, how's it going? Since Kurtis didn't bother, here's an extra greeting! Hey guys, how's it going? It's very good to see you again
but I subscribed for the extra greeting 🥺
the way Kurtis chose to watch Rapunzel for the Barbie category and not 12 Dancing Princesses 🤧🤧🤧🤧
kurtis give us the extra greeting or I unsubscribe
Penelope didn't fly over the barrier because she was scared of heights 🙄✋come on Kurtis it clearly said that in the movie. Pay attention next time
NOW A MONSTER HIGH MOVIE
"Dylan walked so e-boys could run their fingers through their hair" ahaha I'm dead 😂💀 Also, you missed a trick not including Harvey Weinstein in the nominees for 'Horniest Weasel'
Bro i reallly wanted the 20th anniversary bratz dolls :(((
Scrolltum, what a missed opportunity
Kurtis’s mustache reminds me of the dad from Inside Out
9:50 this might be my favourite kurtis skit ever
the angry twerking 😭😭 i’m crying
I LOVE U
EXTRA GREETING, NOW!
#kurtisconnerisoverparty
all the unexpected weasel moans during this video-
I'm sorry .... I ...I just can't focus on anything kurtis is saying with his mustache ... it's ......😭😭😭
Kurtis roasting my favorite Barbie movies as a child is everything I needed in life
leave a comment you jerk
I LOVEEEE YOURRRR VIDDEEEOOSSSS
Bratz are always better#Bratz fan
0:00 the podcast listeners heard it first
WHAT
i knew thats what it stood for
Ok I think that the lack of extra greeting is cause for a rebellion in KurtisTown. Who will join me in starting a civil war and overthrowing Kurt unless he gives us our extra greeting? I nominate myself to run for the new KurtisTown Mayor and I promise that you will always get an extra greeting with me as your leader.
Kurtis woke up today and chose violence 🔪
Ya hooo da ba yo
Kurtis how dare u disrespect Barbie like that u literally watched the worst Barbie movie. U must post another video apologizing and watching the best Barbie movie (which is pretty much all of them except 'barbie and the pink shoes' that was a disappoint to all)
that was a big sneeze. bless you
hobi omg what r u doing on a barbie movie
I loved Barbie as Rapunzel!! I can't believe how bad the animation actually was. in my mind, it was a masterpiece
Oh no…   Kurtis has a dad sneeze
i need more of kurtis reacting to bratz 👁u👁
Here yall go again pitting two bad bitches against each other🙄
Please make the moustache go away PLEASE!
You look like John Oates.
WOMP WOMP WOMPP
I know this is a joke video, but it really isn't fair to compare one of the first Barbie movies that was made in like 2002 to one of the later Bratz movies that was made in like 2007  Both series developed, both series had hits and misses, both are good and bad in their own right
Why does Penelope the dragon look like Spyro
11:05 and I'm not breathing omg 😂
it’s a shame that the english version of barbie as rapunzel doesn’t have the ICONIC “pega ele, frita ele, faz purê”
the do i wanna gnome joke had kurtis going thru the stages of grieve lmao
Barbie as Rapunzel and Barbie in Swan Lake have to be the two worst Barbie movies ever (obviously 12 Dancing Princesses and Barbie as Island Princess are the best).
Unsubscribing and disliking all your vids….extra greeting is a scam  edit: I’m also moving out of kurtis town :(
Put 👏the 👏weasel 👏 moan 👏on the sound 👏board
Yo, my nose is pierced as well. Have you ever tried the Hinged hoops? They’re dope as fuck
I had both dolls but definitely preferred bratz because I thought they had wayyy cooler clothes and makeup. barbie was so boring and they all looked pretty much identical. with the bratz I gave them all individual personalities and stuff but used barbies as background characters lol sure, bratz had big heads or whatever but they had way more personality
Kurtis has that dad sneeze 😟
can i say, princess and the pauper is the only barbie movie i've watched, and i remember loving that shit when i was like 9, but i just know that if i rewatch it now, i'll hate it and i don't wanna be disappointed
Uoou canceld twiter go brrrrr
This was actually extremely entertaining. We need more Barbie movie reviews!!!
Never thought I would be excited abt a barbie or bratz video
Okay but why is that gnome actually good Irish representation? The accent, talking as gaeilge- why is it good????
I love how I did my final school project on the same exact thing before kurtis last month
Love how both Danny and Kurtis’s videos today have to do with dancing
The way he grabed her waist... WHY IS IT SO SMALLL? OML
This is exactly the kind of content I signed up for
I remember my dad bought be a MyScene doll who was brown like me and I cried, I was so happy 😂
We need more Barbie movie reviews sir please and thank you ✌️💕
Ngl I always look at the letters and for some reason thought it meant Virgo
Where is my extra greeeeting😡😡😡
only a virgin would decide that the bratz movie is better than the barbie movie
chipper, i hardly know her
Don't worry, I said the extra greeting for u
I used to watch Barbie rapunzel when I was like 7 at my babysitters house and that opening clip suddenly brought all the memories flooding back
Why was every guy in every bratz movie called Dylan….
your bald version looks like Chester Bennington
kurtis you made me cry. i want my extra greeting back.
KURTIS PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE MAKE A VIDEO ABOUT WILLY'S WONDERLAND I JUST WATCHED IT WITH MY MOM AND IT'S SO WOERD AKD DISTURBING
ok but... ok but barbie princess and the pauper was so good aight
when he paused after saying “chipper” i fully expected him to say “chipper i hardly know her”
I agree with his verdict. Kelly was fucking scary
The greeting....THE GREETING
Here lies the Extra Greeting 🪦 It served its purpose, but its time has come. Farewell, old friend. Fly free 🕊️ *RIP*
gunna need you to review ALL the other bratz movies PLZ
23:37 taki
26:19 pixie king dad is a dilf?
fun fact: barbie is short for Barbra
not him pitting women against each other😡😡😡
As as kutis town citizen myself I feel as though I’ve been robbed of my privilege, and writing this, it is a official complaint to the mayor. If this complaint will not be heard out I will seriously consider rehoming myself and giving up my citizenship in this town.
YESSS i loved bratz as a kid and still do. for some reason before i understood i was a lesbian and liking feminine things is okay it doesn't make me a stereotype or have to be a tomboy, i hated barbies bc they were 'traditionally' pretty i even cut one's hair off, stripped her and pulled the head/neck out of the body 😭 but i still loved the barbie movies as a kid. i had so many bratz as a kid i wish i still had them
Yes!! Small Soldiers was fucking amazing!
I demand an extra greeting. Residents of Kurtis Town, I say we stage a coup
Whenever I see VRG i don’t think virgin, i think verga, and that’s beautiful
THE APOLOGY  HAS JAMES CHARLES UNDER IM CRYING
Okay, okay, resubbed
Woah there, nelly. God bless you.
let’s start a mutiny. call kurtis a virgin until he gives us our extra greeting back.
DO A PART 2 KING
me: a doll collector, fan of both of these lines  kurtis: 😼
only VIRGINS don’t give extra greetings
i laughed so hard at this, this maybe my new favourite youtube video!! could you mabe do a video on monster high dolls, when i was younger i had them as well as bratz and barbies, and the monster high movies were so good, they where my favourite, could you maybe do a video of about them?
where’s the extra greeting 💔
Kurtis extra greetings made me so happy. What hell is this?
I feel like I have watched more barbies movies than Kurtis has ever added a fart sound effect
Whoa
hey kurtis this video was extra funny are you okay?
Bratz was my obsession until I turned 13. I’m so glad you did this video!
Ow. That intro hurt. Lmao
Why did you choose Rapunzel when Princess and the Pauper is a million times better smh
You have been found guilty of creating Monday’s. You are sentenced to the wrath of Garfield.
"This was your one chance for Kelly to not look like what stubbing your toe feels like."
I WAS PROMISED AN EXTRA GREETING! such scam 😂
Kurtis must use that clip of Barbie saying  'B A L L S' in every one of his videos from now on.
Didn't Penelope not figure out how to fly till that scene towards the end? I haven't seen the movie since I was a kid, but I remember her having a whole conflict with her father about being bad at being a dragon.
Why didn’t kurtis ever plus his merch in this vid? *eats water or snack*
The crossover we didn’t know we needed and didn’t expect.
8:20 Wilhelm? You mean Kaiser Wilhelm, aka King William of Windsor?
dude u should've watched bratz rock angelz, that movie SLAPS
The look of defeat after "do I wanna gnome" followed by a James Charles quip... congrats kurtboy this is already a classic
...bless you
how fucking dare i not get my extra greeting. unsubbing rn
You are my absolute favorite YouTuber ever ever ever thank you
I feel like dad just took away my iPad
I ONLY COME HERE TO GET AN EXTRA GREETING AND IF YOU DONT DO IT I SWEAR
Kurtis in his rebellious stage with this anti extra greeting shit huh
this is the quality content i subscribed for
i can't believe kurtis betrayed us. we subscribed for the extra greeting, kurtis! take accountability😡 /j
Watch Kurtis grow out of his "ew country boys🤮" phase and slowly transforming into the ennemy
Why did 'Mattel me that" make me laugh snort? Like I had to take a moment.
No extra greeting?! Nooooooo! Is this what true heartbreak feels like? How will I survive this? I feel like my whole world has been thrown off it’s axis. 😭
Just found out kurtis is scared of Irish gnomes this is so sad 😔💔
no extra greeting? damn....my unsubscribe button looks so bored.....
I could live with him forgetting the extra greeting, but doing it on purpose? He is punishing us all! I mean, if he says he's not a virgin it probably is true, right?
A kurtis video: just what I needed today. Thank you Kurt Boy♥️the video made my day.
Okay do y’all remember My Scene dolls ?! They were like bratz and barbs combined. And their website was streets ahead.
i went from watching kurtis videos to only listening to them, that mustach-hair combo is a disaster that I have to look away from
AHAHAHAHAH THE LITTLE JAMES CHARLES REFERENCE
Lmao the way the weasel in the Barbie movie talks makes me so uncomfortable 💀🤚🏾
as a huge fan of both bratz and barbies i really needed this. thank you kurtis
My girlfriend and I have been binging every barbie movie and I come to do some dishes and listen to Kurtis Connor and there's more god damn barbie movies
A DOUBLE FEATURE???
not kurtis misgendering hedwig djhfgsdhjgf
who is this and why does he look like napoleon dynamite with a moustache
some of you might be intimidated by a 30min video about Bratz and barbies, however I, who watched a 5 hour retrospective of iCarly seasons 1 through 3 two days ago do not have this weakness
*Kurtis posts a video about Barbie* Me: "How can I refuse not clicking immediately?"
This Kurtis guy kinda sucks
Please do a BCU (Bratz cinematic universe) review
help I'm going into extra greeting withdrawal
EWWW YOU WATCHED MOVIES MADE FOR GIRLS!!?!?!?! HAHAHA YOU'RE A LITTLE GIRL HAHAHAH!!! LITTLE NERD!!        *i*m kidding of course*
Dude.... You gotta watch more Barbie movies 😂 Princess and the Pauper has the best villan. Please. Sir.
Kurtis is getting bold and disrespectful. Idk him holding in that extra greeting and rubbing it in our face is something I can’t stand for. Canceled ❌🚫🚫🚫❌
you can really tell kurtis let bo burnham's new special get to him with that "i am not what i create"
DAMN Kurtis already hit on Polly Pocket a million times, but now he's talking about the barbie movie I really fucked with? Kurt, do you just make content specifically for me?
I never really liked barbie but I use to watch and play with Bratz all the time.
you should do one about monster high!
I deserve my extra greeting. I’m done here I’m outta KurtisTown
As a citizen I am not okay with this. We, as folks, deserve a mayor who will give us an extra greeting.
I decided to watch this while waiting for a face mask to dry... Bad idea. 😂😂
This is the content that I’ve desperately needed
the movie you used for the barbie movie in the thumbnail is 🤌 Chefs kiss
Im actually early... AHH I LOVE YOU KURTISSS IM A PROUDDDD MEMBER OF KURTIS TOWN!
okay but hear me out...  part 2 showdown: barbie princess and the pauper vs. bratz rock angelz       aka the BEST of both franchises      just sayin
But but, try watching other Barbie movies 🥺 like the 12 dancing princess (my favourite), mermadia, swan lake etc
With my greatest regret I’d like to inform everybody that our very own mayor is a FRAUD, he once again failed to deliver the extra greeting he had promised each and every one of us citizens. Very sad, heartbreaking even 💔 Edit: this video is a masterpiece, you’re forgiven
I really, unironically love the mullet so much omg
You really cant act like people being upset at Bratz for looking the way they do is weird when Barbie exists, that doesn't make any sense?? Look at how Bratz actually look, and then look at the way that all the big famous influencers look with huge lip fillers and inhuman amounts of makeup. Bratz still encouraged young girls to change their appearence to fit an impossible standard by presenting these deformed almost-humans as being really pretty and hot. It was, and still is incredibly damaging. But Kurtis is a cis man so I'm sure he knows best about what does and doesn't matter to women.
How much to another review? (◍•ᴗ•◍)
I never thought anybody else watched these
16:39 why did I think he was gonna day that she’s a TRANS student 😭✋
this is the video i never knew i needed so badly
Man it’s a shame Quentin Tarantino didn’t win the horniest weasel award 😤
"This was your one chance for Kelly to not look like what stubbing your toe *feels* like" LMAOOOO
what the HELL. Kurtis Conner. I need my Extra Greeting.
10:05 do thou carpets match thy drapes  kurtis’ jokes never get old
Dylan https://youtu.be/fFHSvu4txvQ
I really hope your mustache stinks
ya hooo da ba yo 👁👅👁
The bratz games tho😤😤😤❤️❤️❤️
"do i wanna gnome" and the reaction after means absolutely everything to me and is the most relatable content on this website. kurtis, you're forgiven for no extra greeting
I am so early so can I be the next mayor of Kurtistown?
Ok Kurtis we get it you have a crush on the weasel
Danny, I'm amazed you've survived all of the Taki dust
The chase music really is a bop though
kurtis 🧑‍🍼
Rapunzel was an unfortunate pick, Kurtis would’ve gotten a much more positive “what the fuck” out of Princess & The Pauper or 12 Dancing Princesses. Nightmare monkey supremacy over horny weasels.
in my opinion bratz are aesthetically prettier than Barbie. their fit, hair and makeup are UNMATCHED. but honestly, the Barbie movies are by far more superior and nostalgic
The fact that Gothel and her weasel are simps,it scares me.😳😞😓😣😖
I fuckin Stan the Bratz and Barbie video games and movies
I will never understand people who talk about dolls and cartoons having unrealistic bodytypes. IT'S A FUCKING DOLL THEY'RE NOT REAL IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!! KIDS DON'T EVEN GIVE A SHIT WHAT THEIR BODIES LOOK LIKE IT'S ADULTS THAT CARE SO MUCH!!!
Moral of the video: Danny is upset he's a vrg and Takis are dangerously intense
on the topic of barbie, life in the dreamhouse is pretty funny ngl
Heyyyy kurtis
#kurtisconnerisoverparty no extra greeting! And it was a choice, I'm so offended 😡😡😡
Kurt is has no daughter, therefore still a virgin
Kurtis be looking like an uncle
Oh my god finally the video I never knew I needed
_"I'm going to piss on you"_ Kurtis said CALMLY.
Barbie and the diamond castle basically raised me. That's probably why I'm a wlw😂
never thought you would talk abt bratz or barbie but i'm still thoroughly intrigued
Im unsubbing until the greeting comes back
IM SO MAD HE DIDNT REVIEW BRATZ ROCK ANGELZ WHAAAAT
I never saw too many Bratz movies but that one sure has a lot of similarities to Barbie A Fairy Secret 🤔
Why did they make the gnome irish??? He literally called them the Irish word for girls i- what was the reason??!?!?!?
“can a virgin have a podcast?” yes kurtis they can...cuz i have one...
finally kurt is making videos about what *really* matters
Don't ever not do your extra greeting again, I feel betrayed. Please apologize.
ya hooo da ba yo
Kurtis… you said if I subscribed I would get an extra greeting… This is not what I signed up for 😐
I grew up with both but especially liked the Barbie movies and I still like them even though the animation is kinda cursed. Also a lot of them do the vocal recording where I live and one of my friends was a character in 12 dancing princesses.
Tiger King if he grew up listening to Twenty Øne Pilots
I actually used to like MyScene dolls better. Why is noone talking about them? I'm SAD :( LOL
14:45 him: if you want to go grab a water or a snack-  Me: literally stands up and grabs a glass of water 'cause I'm thirsty 😂😂😂🤣
I love that Kurtis went over two of my favorite movie from when I was a child lmao
I do not remember this Barbie movie being that weird as a little kid.
:(
Kurtis having a breakdown over “balls” is a big mood
Kurtis is really trying to deny the fact he’s a virgin
Takis are seriously intense
Kurtis hating on Kelly this entire video has me dead 💀
yeah you are not a virgin i totally believe that
this is such a great video to watch while drunk, it's amazing, its incredible, its out of this world
ya hooo da ba yo
what about monster high? barbie for the future emo/goth kids.
I didn't get what I subbed for, and the mayor acknowledged it.
i fear for kurtis' saftey after not doing an extra greeting
11:50
"Rapunzel is bald now" I can't stop laughing 😂😂😂😂
ya hooo da ba yo Kurtis told me to
Gen Z fashion is just copied homework from the Bratz pixies
im literally begging you to review more barbie movies
All this Barbie vs Bratz and yet there’s My scene and they ate these girls up by being the love child (imo) 😌✨
I honestly forgot that you still had to watch the bratz movie
damn the music in the bratz movie slaps 😳
your gonna regret that
EXCITED TO WATCH THIS KURTIS . WHAT A TOPIC.
packing up and moving out of Kurtistown I AM HERE TO BE EXTRA GREETED HOW DARE
Its homophobic that you didn't chose barbie diamond castle
I aint even watch the video yet just know that bratz won every time goodbye
MY LIFE NEEDS THE GREETING
Is this really our town mayor hmmm suspicious I say!!
The more agro the mustache the more agro the Kurt and I’m here for it
i have never in my life been so excited to click on a video
kurtis, listen here, when i subscribed i was promised an extra greeting. are u scamming me rn? damm, i feel betrayed
Barbie is borderline terrifying
Kurtis makes everything way to funny I've rewind like 5 times to rewatching something its so funny
petition for kurtis to release a whole song about rapunzel being bald called "Rabaldzel"
how dare you not do the extra greeting!!! I am unsuscribing!
Is that weasel Hisoka's cousin???
7:52 can we just talk about the facts that his 2 hands fit around her ENTIRE waist
My barbie hyper fixation is BUZZING
why in the world would you not choose barbie fairytopia? barbie diaries? barbie in the nutcracker? princess and the pauper?!?!?
WHAT A BANGER VIDEO
THE SOUND HEELS MAKE IN BARBIE AS RAPUNZEL WERE MY FIRST INADVERTENT EXPOSURE TO ASMR
Wheres my extra greeting, Kurtis?? I feel robbed, and vengeance will be mine.
ya hooo da ba yo
22:38 Midsommar be like
"concerned parents" are the 2 most terrifying words in the english language...
#kurtisconnerisoverparty
Not picking princess and the pauper was not the move
I would love for you to address Mattel's response to Bratz: MyScene dolls. They were amazing, slightly more dramatic/hot looking Barbies (including the guy dolls!!!). Baby me was stoked
i. love. this.
FINALLY someone else who also thought that Rapunzel's hair must hurt so much when the guy climbs on them, i always thought that too!!!!
Why did you skip the extra greeting im  unsubscribing
Princess and the Pauper is a solid 12/10 and you really went for a mid tier movie instead smh
u get a dislike from me because of no extra greeting😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐
i’m actually glad kurtis is not doing the extra greeting, i feel like he’s been feeling kinda forced to do it. i’m sure it got exhausting to say over and over again
omg brATZ FASHION PIXIES....i would watch this so often as a kid even tho I love barbie more, this bratz move was gudd
11:20 Why does that sound like a real song 🤔🤭 is it?
My mom didn’t let my sister play with bratz cuz she said they were too slutty.
not getting that extra greeting kinda hurt 🥺
hedwig is a girl, kurtis.
Kurtis: I’m not doing an extra greeting   Me:😪unsubscribes
KURTIS IS 27? I thought he was like 11 and had a weird disease where his hair grows faster in only specific parts of his upperlip and bottom of his scalp 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
My dumbass thought vrg meant virgo
Okay, I'm here for it
bratz are way better
my sister looks exactly like kelly-
Me: opens video and like it Kurtis: 'no extra geeting today' Me: *slowly unlikes the video*
KURTIS have you seen the live action Mario film from 1993 it's gold
VRg - Very Really good Virgins
#kurtisconnorisoverpart
Now this is the content i signed up for
kurtis please there are way better barbie movies and I need you to watch them
Cancel Kurtis, it's not the same without my extra greeting
Mom: what are you doing Me: I'm watching a Harry styles look-alike with a mullet and a moustache talk about Barbie and bratz dolls
No one: Kelly's forehead:       🦲   👁👄👁
I haven't started the video yet but I am looking forward to finding out  how Kurtis came up with this video idea
extra greetings are our thing, how could you :,)
Well, looks like there is no point in being subscribed if I’m not gonna get an extra greeting for it.
OMG, the baby Bratz movie was literally nightmare fuel for 8 year old me, but I watched it on repeat for like, a full year
I grew up with both barbies and bratz when I was younger but I always preferred bratz because they actually had dolls with the same skin color as mine and their clothes was 100% better and more fashionable. I watched all of the Barbie movies but I don’t remember watching any of the bratz ones. I don’t remember them being that low quality for some reason.
I like your hair kurtis
NO EXTRA GREETING ON PURPOSE…. WE WILL BURN KURTISTOWN TO THE GROUND IN REBELLION!!!!!! THIS IS A THREAT MAYOR KURTIS
Блин крутой монтаж конечно, хотел бы я так делать свои нарезки
Bratz were better but I liked both movies. I still watch them and I'm 27. I just watched princess and the pauper last week
Gothel? I hardly know her
No extra greeting unsubscribing!! 😡😡
kurtis conner more like kurtis thee stallion
"DO I WANNA GNOME?" HHAHAHAH
this video was a very wild ride
mullet and mustache kurt like if you agree
Kurtis, I respect that you want to be the bigger man here and try to, as you said, “take back control” but this is too far. I put my life on that extra greeting. That extra greeting is what keeps me going through the night and being without one, I’m disgusted and extremely disappointed. Unless I do get one in the next video, I will unsubscribe and then proceed to throw myself off a cliff and leave my switch to my dog. This is a warning.
DYLAN LOOKS LIKE LIL HUDDY
the Bratz aesthetic walked so teens on TikTok could renegade
The James Charles apology 🤣
The energy today is 👌👌👌
You took away our extra greeting once we kept quite, Now you took it again you won't be able to silent our voices.  Petition to overthrow Kurtis Conner from mayor's position  Successor candidates ~ Kurtis Cobber I hardly know her.  Let's raise our voices in unity against this injustice !
How dare you...
another more absence of an extra greeting and i might turn off the notification bell.... this was your doing #sad
You remember chalkzone Kurtis!!!!!! Thank you so much I’ve been thinking about that show for a long time and forgot the name!!!
*sobs* no extra greeting? #lifeisoverparty
The mustache lookin lush today
I am a longtime subscriber. I come here often! I deserve an extra greeting! I want to speak to your manager, young man...
So we got drew, Scott, Danny and kurtis just waiting on drew
Bro i watcehd this movie as a kid, how did my parents not pay attention to this weasel
NO EXTRA GREETING!? UNSUBSCRIBED.
this will not be forgiven you better give 2 extra greetings next vid
this is an insane vs
the " i didnt mean it im desperate" had me dead
Haven’t watched the video yet but Bratz is the only right answer
FINALLY
Not giving us our extra greeting is most definitely a virgin move.
I missed this
as a barbie,bratz and kurtis fan this video is a dream come true
God I watched Barbie rapunzel so many times as a kid
NOT THE ARCTIC MONKEYS PUN SJSJSJS IM DYING-
I feel so disgusting and betrayed, to not forget the extra greeting, but to purposely omit it
ugh love how he purposefully didnt do the greeting. YOU GO FUNKY BADDIE. twerking moment yall
Bratz had better diversity & style. Barbie had a better franchise in terms of their movies & attempts at “positivity” for girls by promoting STEM careers
SFDFSDBDSFBFDBXGHDXHTFX THE ARCTIC MONKEY JOKE😭😭😭
Never realized how much the world needed this video until now
why are we pitting two queens against each other. they are girlfriends!!! they are kissing!!!!
*To the tune of Do I Wanna Know by Arctic Monkeys* "Do I wanna gnome?" -Kurtis conner 2021
The way the prince dude fits both of his hands around Barbie’s waist at 7:52 makes me so uncomfortable for some reason.
You dont even have to talk about it just watch barbie life in the dream house, its literally so good!!
is the gnome jamaican or scottish?
omg i was literally talking to my mom today about bratz vs barbie. Kurtis is reading my mind
I forgot how terrible the old animation in Barbie movies was 😂
I'm sorry but that weasel moaning is freaking me out 😭
oh god that gnome is going to give me nightmares
Ya hooo da ba yo. I’ll see myself out.
no extra greeting :(  my heart hurts
Thanks for the birthday vid homie
The podcast rly is very rly good
The sister not only feels like how you stub a toe, but looks like one.
Yknow what i think Kurtis is bold for not giving us a second greeting today, i kind of respect it this time.
really enjoy kurtboy dissecting my favorite childhood movies , this is a perspective i never considered
2:20 Loved the comment about shaving
#kurtisconnerisoverparty
I blame bratz for unrealistic beauty standards... like...why can’t *I* have lips like that 🥺😢
Why are you trying to pit two bad bitches against each other?
who else remembers the third kind of doll - the MyScene dolls?
“THAT IS CORRECT… SHORTY”
You should twitch stream the Barbie rapunzel pc game
There's no reason to subscribe anymore, where the extra greeting? 😢
This is a serious topic Kurtis
You should watch Barbie and the twelve dancing princesses ITS SOO GOOD MY WHOLE CHILDHOOD
I remember watching Small Soldiers when I was little, but up until now I thought the whole thing was a fever dream.
two movies in one vid? you spoil us
no one: pewdiepie: 18:27
:(
seeing barbie vs bratz and kurtis conner in one frame is wild
kurtis horniest weasel nods
11:50 I AM CRYING LMAO
I love these very informational videos, drew
WHERE THE FUCK IS THE EXTRA GREETING
Imagine if a young child searching up bootleg barbie / bratz movies on youtube and stumble across this
Barbie had a dreamhouse and a caucasian man named Ken as a boyfriend , while Bratz had a penthouse and goes to clubs on the weekends It's up to personal preferences honestly
Ewwww a beautiful girl with long ASS hair?!?! 🤢🤮🤮🤮
If fresh fit taught me anything, it’s that virgins can have a podcast.
kurtis this is outrageous.
Bratz Fashion Pixiez is the best movie ever created
Im in love withthe weasel
I love kurtis so much I want my son to look up to you instead of his real daddy lmao learn some repsecr
didn't know that the weird moaning weasel meme was from a barbie movie lol
This is the weirdest day of content, Kurtis is  talking about dolls and Drew is making Takis content. WHAT ARE THOSE?!
This video is even better because Rapunzel was actually the only 00s Barbie movie I didn’t see! Now I get to watch it for free, commentated over by my favourite white boy
The bratz dolls literally just had black features there was nothing inappropriate abt them lmao
ya hooo ba do yo
10:10 this was the plot of a comic i made as a kid
CANCELLED
So that's what Kurtis meant when he said he wanted to do more deep dive documentaries this year
Your letters should be VRS for very really stinky cause that's what this video is without an extra greeting
I fucking hated this Barbie movie. My little cousin used to make us watch it everytime we went to their house
my mommy wouldn’t let me play w bratz bc they were “trashy” i always loved their fashion so much and imma buy myself a new bratz doll when they come out, bc fuck u mommy😾😾 jk love my mommy  but i always wanted a bratz doll so badly
that weasel was hella hard 😩
Fucken love me some barbiez like
doth thy curtains match thy drapes 😭😭😭
Break the chains of the Second Greeting, my guy. I could tell you haven't been vibing with it the past while.
Thank god you didn’t give us an extra greeting today, I was running out of space on my shelves to store those
Why have we not risen and retaliated yet? Our mayor has betrayed us? Where is the justice of the Kurtis Town citizens???
As a weird doll man myself, I could not be more prepared for this video. Honestly bratz is so much better, Especially now since mattel has been making cheap ass dolls
I can't believe you. We trusted you... where's our extra greeting! We need our rights back!!!
kurtis you have crossed the LINE
I'd like to paint kurtis's nails one time so that they don't always look like he's been chewing it off instead of chewing food
Today on June 18th 3:19 pm I was robbed of an extra greeting which I have earned as a loyal citizen of Kurtis Town this is something that any citizen should never have to face… The video was funny though so it’s okay
In defence of Penelope: she’s afraid of heights
“i’m not a virgin guys i have a podcast” is an oxymoron
sometimes kurtis…i wonder what goes through your head
Dylan looks like every short dark haired hey mamas lesbian on tiktok. LMAOOO
not you popping off again
the james charles apology lol
Bratz FTW
the barbie sea of friends book cover just unlocked a core childhood memory thank u
Today on Kurtis Town news: All Kurtis Town citizens are devastated. The level of sadness has increased and people are devastated by their greetings being taken away   And Kurtis himself has stated he is indeed not a virgin.
only a virgin would not give us an extra greating
PLEASE SHAVE
kurtis.. where is the extra greeting 😀
Not that mustache- 😃🦧😭🥶
I tough the VRG stands for Virgo... Maybe I am the virgin...
ya hooo da ba yo
This is not a question for me, we didn't have bratz in greece, barbie was the thing and like monster high but less so barbie Is on another level for me
What's my motivation as a citizen of Kurtistown now that my extra greeting has been taken away?
9:54 I can't believe Kurtis got Smrtdeath to be in his video
Never thought I would watch a man in his late 20s covering Barbie movies.
WHERE IS MY GREETING?! I DIDN'T SIGN UP FOR THAT!
Kurtis, I love you, and I never ever want to hurt you. I think you should know though that your moustache makes people's skin crawl. I'm people.
WHERE THE FUCK IS MY EXTRA GREETING?! I WAS HYPED, BUT NOW I'M JUST MAD. UNSUBBED
Very really virgin
MONSTER HIGH >>>>>>>>>>>
mullet still going strong i see, nice job
disappointed i didn't get my extra greeting - this is not what i signed up for - not funny - unfollowed.
bratz is also notable not only for darker skin tones, but also textured hair! as well, it put features like big lips into a positive light
kurtie boy talking about barbies. what a virgin thing to do..
youre getting canceled
bestie why,,, did you pick the worst barbie movie to watch 🤡
i wasn’t even allowed to have bratz dolls as a kid lol
That letters in the backround stand for "verga"
Honestly my pal Kurt's moustache is growing on me. Just like it's growing on hin
But takis are SERIOUSLY intense
If I don’t get an extra greeting, then whats the point of subscribing? /j
DID IT WORK? Yes.
WOAH IM EARLY GREAT VIDEO THO (i mean from how far i am in-)
Kurtis dad jokes keep me sane
Wait until Kurtis watches Barbie Princess and the Pauper
how did I get here so fast thank you for making me be here kurtis big fan of bobby flay, Barbie, and bratz oui oui good video
No extra greeting????? I say we bring signs with passive aggressive comments outside the mayor’s office in protest
No extra greeting? unsubscribed
Ohh in spanish vrg is short for a very inappropriate slang word lol
why do i remember the barbie movie so clearly
kurt u really read kelly to filth 🤭
8:59 Hedwig is a *she* Kurtis lmao
I’m withering. the extra greeting was the only thing that has kept me young. My fingers are turning to dust as i write this.
"Are kids ugly or do I just hate kids," a new podcast by Kurtis Conner
That’s not an arsehole that’s the greendale community college flag
chill w the Kelly slander
Barbie: Princess Charm School was the original dark academia
If I don’t get an extra greeting, then whats the point of subscribing?
Kurtis never gave his extra greeting, I no longer feel valued as a human being.
early
Sir, you have stepped in dangerous territory
ONLY VIRGINS TAKE AWAY OUR EXTRA GREETINGS KURTIS
ya hooo da ba yo
i saw the title and SCREAMED
WEASEL IS ICONIC THANK YOU VERY MUCH
kurtis! you watched the worst barbie movie!
i get that most of those “kurtisconnerisoverparty” comments are jokes, but it is kinda rude when he said in the video that he isn’t doing it cause he hates his viewers, it’s because it’s his channel and he can switch it up if he wants. i think that’s great! kurtis should have control over his channel, we can only make recommendations
broke: hedwig is a girl woke: hedwig is a trans boy owl specifically to piss of jkr
The tongue stick out😂😂 do a collab with EMMA chamberlain
Brats were cheaper so that’s what I had
kurtis i though u learned from your past mistakes😔
nono barbie absolutely had competition, though not super often. jem and the holograms dolls is a good example
Rock Angelz has the music that slaps though ✊😔 But I get why you picked Fashion Pixiez (Barbie as Rapunzel was a given with the Otto memes)
kurtis. i am upset. i needed that extra greeting today
Holy shit l read the title as "barbie vs barbz" and honestly l wasn't surprised
How am I supposed to enjoy this video when my extra greeting is taken away??
idk if anyone asked for this but i think we can all agree its what we needed
Me my gang hate kelly
No extra greeting = virgin
I've never slammed a video faster than I did upon seeing a fresh Kurtis vid
0:26 you just broke my heart
No extra greeting? Smh I’m unsubscribing
*stays silent while kurtis hates on kelly*
I never expected to see Kurtis react to movies of my childhood       (But he reacted to Goat movie already so Idk Why I’m surprised)
HELLO SIR IS THAT THE GREENDALE FLAG BLURRED??? THE ASS HOLE?
The best characters in Barbie movies weren’t even human so…
Kurtboy you are GLOWING in this
I liked this video before watching but you betrayed us Kurtis.... no extra greeting? what’s next? you stop calling us folks altogether? fame changed you dude
Kurtis: I'M NOT A VIRGIN  Virgins: IM NOT A VIRGIN  hmmmmmmmm, theres a pattern here
A second ago I was thinking of commiting arson and then.. ✨magical sparkle twinkle sound effect✨ Our dearest mayor has posted
Bratz win every time
kurtis is just a virgin that can't give an extra greeting
It sucks being named after a dragon
kurtis talkin bout dolls and action figures is the cutest thing
Where's the extra greeting??!
kurtis's hair looks like a barbie doll whose hair was supposed to be curly but it has been played with so many times it doesn't look good anymore sorry kurtis
#kurtisisoverparty im devastated by the lack of the extra greeting
no extra greeting? thats something a virg would do >:(
Chigeb wimg
THIS TOWN IS GOING TO BURN TO THE GROUND WITHOUT AN EXTRA GREETING
This is all I’ve ever wanted in a video. Barbie movies, dolls and Bratz were my whole life as a kid. God bless this video, Kurt
Hey,Kurtis! Can you make a video about the E3 Nintendo direct from this year?
Niqtty
WHY IS KURTIS SUDDENLY TURNING INTO A REBEL
also, scrolltums. that is all.
Didn't do extra greeting ? Uhm.. I'm Unsubscibing >:u
Might as well unsubscribe now because there is no extra greeting
guys the VRG means he’s a virgo
I was hoping the Bratz movie would be the one with the alien potatoes or the girl with the nose job. Maybe this should be a series
Fashion pixies was one of the only bratz movies I had growing up and this unlocked so many memories
So drew Danny and… who’s that third guy? Anyways it’s wild y’all have my exact sense of humor but I literally can’t find anyone in real life to match the same humor as me 🤣 it’s either too much for some people, they think I’m funny but they can’t rebuttal or they are OFFENDED
I use to have every single Barbie movie until I was in middle school
no extra greeting on purpose... kurtis, you've gone off the deep end
No extra greeting :( #cancelled
As a citizen I feel like someone just spat on me kurtis this is personal
NO EXTRA GREETING ARE YOU SERIOUS KURTBOY
His podcast is actually called virgin, but he got embarrassed and than he said “WHAT ABOUT THE LETTERS I BOUGHT?!?🙀😢” so he just thought of the first words that started with each letter and now his podcast is called very really good. And that’s the real story! Get it right next time Kurt you fishy fishy stinky liar
thank you for making this kurtis🤞
Kurtis, knowing the plot of Rapunzel as well as I do, your retelling isn't quite right, but it is so funny.
#kurtisconnorisover
You unlocked the bitter old man achievement at 27... HA. I UNLOCKED THAT WHEN I WAS 12
I remember asking myself what VRG meant and my first thought was virgin LMAO and then I remembered that Kurtis has a podcast named Very Really Good
I stopped scrolling to see if anyone pointed out that hedwig is a girl.  -Elder Millenial
whole video felt off without the extra greeting
i really likes this video kurtis. keep it up👍🏼
never in a million years did i think kurtis would talk about barbie movies, my entire childhood. What a day
I am now Sebastian balling my eyes out because you didn’t do the extra greeting
fairly certain u just skimmed thru this movie kurtis
ex-effing-cuse me sir?!?! No extra greeting? I guess we do not have to be nice to the mayor anymore if there are no laws
16,400th
As a virgin, I too lave lied and said "I'm not a virgin".
Kurtis I know it’s the law to be nice to you but…I will be forced to break the law. IF I MISS OUT on ONE more extra greeting, I’m gonna rally with a bunch of other citizens and we will LEAVE!  Bye VRG
some would say that this is a very controversial video kurtis
I still have the Bratz game I had for my Gameboy back in the day, and I never really figured out how to actually play it🤣🤣
#unsubscribing wheres my extra greeting
Kurtis if you keep up this “no extra greeting” thing, you won’t be re-elected as mayor of Kurtis Town. Be careful.
kutis please do an extra greeting next time    - disappointed costumer     (j)
THEN HOW DO I KNOW YOU WANT ME TO COME BAK WHEN I DINT GET AN EKSTRA GREEEETING!!!!!!!!
I love Kurtis, but this topic was a lil out of his wheelhouse. Its fun to see a new fan of the barbie movies LOL, but the brief 'history' on how Barbie lampooned Bratz (And several other doll lines) business was too light...and he just 'supposes' insta models just HAPPEN to look like bratz dolls now...yes. That's not a coincidence. I want a fashion historian's take!
kurtis this is your last warning if you dont greet me next time i will be moving to sebastian balls town    im not playing
when I sae that "vs" above youe head I tghout it was a crown lol
Takis
i can't tell y'all how excited i am about this video man like our absolute ICON mayor talking about fucking barbie vs bratz movies like YESS PLEASE OMG
bratz is the best by far
no extra greeting 😭😭
Bratz. Bratz is better. I really love their outfits and shoes
We need the full version of "rapunzel is bald now".
Barbie 100%
Why would I subscribe to a virgin if I’m not gonna get an extra greeting?
kurtis oh my gosh. i got so excited when i saw the title i wanted to CRY!!!! barbie is one of my biggest intrests and you’re my favorite youtuber and i just couldnt be happier to get this notification :,] i freaking LOVE U kurt <333
That’s cool
How dare you I'm gona unsubscribe dude
kurtis bro the hair pulling doesnt hurt cos it's wrapped around the pilar!
What the fuck kurtis give me my extra greeting right now.
very really gvirgin
Kurtz:talks about functioning shitting Barbie  well actually kurits there was something called baby born a toy that shat and cried meant for children and I used to feed mine mixtures of juice to try get it’s shit a different colour to make a rainbow   Edit: up next monster high vs ever after hgih
crying rn because i didn’t get a greeting 😭
whats the point of ....... anything ..... if theres no extra greeting ....
you should’ve watched “barbie and the magic of the pegasus”
no extra greeting? time for a coup d’etat
The way Sophia the first copied Barbie’s sidekicks in this movie makes me upset, for some reason the Barbie sidekicks are so much better smh
scrolltum...
KURTIS AND DANNY IN ONE DAY
because Penelope was scared of heights you fake barbie fan
smh he should’ve done barbie and the 12 dancing princesses
*a grown man with a moustache and a mullet talks about barbies and bratz* , just another day on the internet
Someone watches Community
BARBIE REIGNS SUPREME 😩😩😩
DOST THOU CARPETS MATCH THY DRAPES
AHHHH NO EXTRA GREETING IM LITERALLY SHAKING RN
Very Really Good Virgin.
Kurtis give me an extra greeting right now or I’ll cry
Extra greeting 😭
kurtis i’m proud of u for not doing an extra greeting. i could see the pain in ur eyes
0:25 … one time?
Bratz statically make gay women (From my experience)
I am extremely biased and if Bratz isn’t declared the superior franchise then... i will cry
Guys seriously i think it's time to let go of the extra greeting our mayor is tired..... If he wants it can be like an special/occasional thing   *Hey kids it's time to let go*
the 'we dont know why, yet' just reminded me of these bad motivational quotes recently rewatched ur video abt them
kurtis conner, you’re the best
yo Kurt would u ever grow a beard along with the stache?
This is one of my favourite videos you've made they're all top tier but the editing and jokes in this one just hit extra hard, thanks kurtis for the best content
i can NOT believe that kurtis didnt cover the ICONIC barbie princess and the pauper 😾👊
WAIT, STOP, NO EXTRA GREETING? I would unsubscribe if I don't like your videos as much as I do. Bratz don't have feetz, they're inferior to barbies that have feet. (Maybe not. Barbie at the time when bratz came out was not as inclusive as bratz but I think they're becoming more inclusive...it's about time)
Kurtis is just glasses away from looking like a sex offender
“I’m not a virgin” 👏EVERY 👏VIRGIN 👏EVER👏
I extra greeting??? :((
Barbie Rapunzel doesn’t pass the bechdel
KURTISSSSSSSS
"I'm not a virgin" is sounding pretty suspicious from the guy with the 'cool uncle' mullet and moustache
Big fan of the mustache mullet combo
Could a virgin do a podcast??? Definitely not Kurt's
Kurtman is here
kurtis and danny upload on the same day we rlly are blessed🙏🙏
mm no extra greeting? #kurtisconneroverpartypt2
Should’ve done Barbie fairytopia
Gen z is the most diverse generation so far , Bratz dolls not only shows that you don't have to be blonde, thin lips, blue eyes and  white to be beautiful but you can be beautiful any color  also when I was younger my friends were all different   ethnicities and it was more inclusive to play bratz with them this is just my opinion.
Danny and Kurtis videos are the reason i
Constantly funny. Absolutely wonderful video Kurtis. 👍 thank you for making my day even better
disliking this video because i didn't get an extra greeting.
"is that adorable?" "yes" "were we idiot?" "absolutely" "did it work?" ".....yes"
thank you for making the content we deserve Kurtis 🙏💜
10:15 omg mr. worldwide????
kurtis broke my heart, i was WAITING for that extra greeting
Danny and Kurtis videos are the reason i wake up in the morning
how dare you take away the extra greeting. I cannot cope with change
that "rapunzel is bald now" unironically slaps
NO You should have watched Princess and the Pauper, Kurt Boy🤬
Kurtis if you don't do a extra greeting you are undoubtedly a virgin, I'm sorry but its tru
5:34 I heard Hobi and I thought that I was on kpop yt for a sec-
Is Danny,Drew and Kurtis uploading together just a thing now?
Kurtis Conner, asking the real questions
ok but barbie and the diamond castle is the best one. it's about 2 cottagecore lesbians and u can't change my mind
Only a virgin would not give an extra greetings
When I was a child in my area bratz were band for wearing thongs. I live in Texas by the way. We had to fight to bring them back because it was the only doll of color we had at the time.
Who is this strange 13 year old on my YouTube?
you know what. i had the worst fucking day today and i really needes that extra greeting 😁 now i feel like crying ! love u kurtis ❤
i got pinned so what? big deal🙄
no extra greeting 😡😕  sir you have lost a follower 🤬😡  (but like not really because i like your videos)
It’s the way that Barbie movie was my favorite and now it’s actual nightmare fuel
ya hooo da ba yo
no extra greeting definitely a virgin
Hey virgin
I BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE TURN IT UP
This made me squeal with excitement from the notification, giddy up kurtistown
Thank u for blessing our Friday with ur existance
Damn..he do be having a mullet
It's only fair that we get a comparison between the worst Barbie movie and Goat Story from the mayor
Kurtis “not a virgin” Conner
Mfs that preferred bratz over barbies scared me as a child
Oh my gOD ITS FUCKING KELLY
ya hooo da ba yo
10:59  Use me as a replay button for this ✨ amazing ✨part
That barbie rapunzel movie unlocked too many memories lol  Their villains always had the longest of faces
Have you met ouR Kelly?! 😅 she's a funky spunky nightmareeeee
The scene of Stefan being chased reminds me of those edits by Vernonator6497
Ive been smeckledorphed
No extra greeting, unsubscribed
Use this comment as your disappointment button for the lack of extra greeting
I dare you, you won't pin this comment
if this video says anything but the superiority of barbie movies i will be supremely upset
liked instantly. i thought earlier that if you uploaded today that would be pretty sick and holy shit you read my mind and answered my prayers. bless kurtis
Bro Kelly in Barbie as Rapunzel doesn’t have a forehead, she got the fucking sixhead going-
Off topic but I love kurtis' black nail polish lol
Your content is starting to match the Chomo stash.
woah jump scare warning for that bald rapunzel part
#CancelKurtyBoy2021
sure sounded awfully defensive,,,, sounds like vrg behavior
Why is the only thing I watch on YouTube grown men making fun of stuff for children
I do have to say that my registered plate with the state of texas is bratz with a <3 lmao
What’s wrong with u man 😂
4:12 assing me 😂
I am going to cry.
Every body know that Little Pets Shop are the best of the 2.
Kurtis just really pulled a bald rapunzel as if we wouldn't notice it's from Shrek
sure the barbie movies slapped but holy fuck the bratz games took about 500 hours of my life as a kid
Dude it scares me how you look so much like a friend of mine, also sick vid 😂
the fact that kurtis didn’t react to princess and the pauper is honestly homophobic
soo should i just unsubscibe since i’m not getting what i was promised 😤😤
I didn’t know I needed Kurtis to react to Barbie movies,  but now I have to request that he react to them all. Here are some that are high up on the priority list:  Princess and the Pauper Swan Lake Twelve Dancing Princesses  Princess & the Pegasus  Better get to it, Kurtis, chop chop!
No.... This can't be. Kurtis is getting drunk with power. No extra greeting?!What next? A Mohawk? We gonna get deported from Kurtis town?
epic
i feel betrayed. parasocial relationships no more, i only got one greeting.
It's good he didn't choose Barbie and the diamond castle or 12 dancing princesses otherwise barbie might have had a chance
kurtis big vrg
He dident do an extra gretting in 12 so Done make fun of me
Woah dude how did this come out 10 minutes ago
ery eally ood
The Diamond Castle is gay
Ok but Barbie in The Princess and the Pauper is the best film of all time
Kurtis = stinky boy
Hey a question for people who played bratz dolls uh was playing with them fun? Cuz my mom never let me have them 😢
i ALWAYSSS wanted a bratz doll, all of my friends had them and my parents would never let me have one. It was infuriating
I wasn't allowed to play with Bratz dolls as a kid because my mom thought they were normalizing/glorifying being a brat.
kurtis: doesn't do an extra greeting me: my disappointment is unmatchible and my day is ruined
When did the guy from hall and Oates start a YouTube channel
Kurtis: doesn't do an extra greeting Me: patiently waits for another kurtis conner is over party
how dare you not acknowledge your subs you bozo #CancelKurtisConner
The Barbie movies r my childhood there r so many good ones and I loved all of them
Never got hooked up on Bratz, I think I was too old. I loved Barbie, but Bratz was really inclusive.
Kurtis : Say that really fast  Me: that , that , that ,that , that , dat , dat, dat ,.dat , ra da da da da dat ta , ra da da da da da dat ta , yeah I did something bad.....
I once had a Barbie electric toothbrush
Why are you being such an angsty teen in this video?
No extra greeting :(
What is happening in kurtis town
You look like my uncle in the 70’s
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cP64cGU0BVc
okay but are they seriously intense
okay so he gets it
You'd better not slander my g Barbie or we'll overthrow you from office
"this is your one chance to make Kelley not look like what stubbing your toe feels like"
What do you mean im not doing extra greeting today thats not what im promised *very angry emoji *
so i subscribed for an extra greeting for what?
Imagine being a vrg
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
2000s kids  2010s kids
I thought it was Virgo
WHERE İS MY EXTRA GREETING!? #KurtisIsOverParty
i’m at work rn so i can’t watch but this is already the greatest piece of art and cinema i’ve ever seen. god bless you kurtis
I still own Bratz Rock Angelz and I still watch it to this day. I love it so much!

#kurtisconnerisoverparty
kurtis your a virgin
i love you for this video kurtis
He didn’t give a regular greeting so let me, a valued citizen of kurtis town give you one:  hey everyone welcome back to my channel, if you’re new here, hi, what’s up, how’s it going, and if you’re coming back, what’s up, how’s it going? It’s very good to see you again, I hope you’re doing well.  Edit: your welcome :)
scrotum scrolls? more like teste testaments
i once had a podcast for 20 years
Kurtis is 27? Damn time for the home.
Kurtis, the citizens of Kurtistown have all been betrayed, please rethink your actions, we need our extra greetings.
Ok but Monster High it's just superior.
he is definitelyyyyyy not a virgin
This is funny timing for me bc Im making my little sister watch all the Barbie movies from my childhood and Im thoroughly enjoying it
I laughed when I read the title of the video  Wow … kurtis making me laugh without saying anything
Cancelled
Not gonna cancel you because of no second greeting, I'm gonna cancel you because of that lip caterpillar.
wdym people wanted women to look like barbies since "forever"? beauty standards before barbie wasn't "super skinny" so cut that cap man   what I'm saying is that body standards were different for everybody. Just commenting on the historical inaccuracy. Sorry, I'm obsessed with it
um ya hooo da ba yo?
Give him to me, uughh 😩
Me after he didnt do his extra greeting: I don't like this new Kurtis, I want the old kurtis. I remember the old kurtis I miss him :(
As a Kelly with a big forehead: hey now….
Ah yes, Barbie as Rapunzel, the movie that created the *”Give him to me AUEGHHHH”* meme
i’m genuinely sad we didn’t get the extra greeting wtf
Dude i loved the rapunzel barbie movie, it was my favorite and i owned almost every single barbie movie. I was obsessed with the baby bratzs movies too 😮‍💨
Put sunglasses on and bamn your that one angry gaming dude (Dr. Disrespect)
Believe it or not the moaning was apart of the script. Listen to all of the dubbed versions and every single one of them moaned 😭
Monster high is best
Ya hooo da ba yo
First danny and now kurtis uploaded, day has been made
Fun Fact: in Europe little Barbie is called Shelly and not Kelly 😃
KURTIS ISTG IM EARLY AGAIN AND IDK IM JUST RLLY HAPPY AHHHHHHH
n....no extra greeting </3
last time i was this early i almost died in childbirth
Very really virgin
Look at brat tv
Bratz literally looks like the curbstomped version of barbie
Kurtis’ pun game has never not been on point
Aye mate, me an' some blokes are gonna put some bratz on the barbie laytah 🇦🇺
Not getting an extra greeting with this video ruined my day ☹
“Give him to me æüggghhh”
Kurtis this is the SECOND time without an extra greeting. We can’t keep doing this.
Kurtis is out here slandering my childhood Barbie movies 💀 they slap so hard and Princess and the Pauper is the best movie ever created and Preminger is the best villain 🧍
3:40 jesus christ, that was actually really funny
I love Bratz
Kurtis how could you do this- BARBIE IS ALWAYS SUPERIOR APPARENTLY
I loved bratz dolls so much more than barbies (mainly because of the inclusivity, but also I thought he clothes were so much better lol) but the barbie movies will always be my favorite
i loved watching this 27 year old man making an half hour long video analysing and comparing barbie and bratz dolls, ty kurt💕
Corn
CURTIS MY EXTRA GREETING HOW DARE YOU
Remember you can just rewind the video to get a Second greeting
scrotum rolls
Cancel Kurtis! Cancel Kurtis! He didn't do the extra greeting! I've been scammed!
i’m so unsettled by no extra greeting that i can’t focus on anything else you’re saying it’s all just fuzz in my head while i repeat no extra greeting, why did i subscribe? am i even a citizen of kurtis town if i don’t have an extra greeting? one day will i wake up and FOLKS will be gone too? i can’t live with this uncertainty
why must we always pit women against each other 😩😩😩😩
Petition to have the Extra Greeting in every video all the time.
No point subscribing anymore smh
y’all I think we’re being gaslighted to think he’s had a podcast this whole time and not a giant vrg
no extra greeting? see you in court
This is a Kurtis Town Socratic seminar
I didn’t really think he was gonna explain vrg
"not a virgin" are you sure kurtis..? isnt that one of the stages of grief? Denial..
5 minutes ago and no extra greeting . kurtis rlly is a virgin smh.
why subscribe when you dont even get the one thing you got promised.. feelsbadman
I demand the extra greeting #cancelkurtisconner2021
I DID NOT EXPECT HIM TO WATCH THE BEST BARBIE MOVIE HOLY SHIT LETS GOOOO
kurtis conner
Kurtis doesn’t post for 2 weeks, and then BAM! Children’s movie review ig? 🤨
OMG I didn’t know I needed this video but now that I’m seeing it🥺🥺🥺
Philadelphia
This is monster high erasure smh
For all of you who remember Bibble from Fairytopia, I’m so sorry
barbie rupenzel was like my least favourte ;-; u should have picked like princess and the pauper, 12 dancing princesses, island princese or tbh like any other sksjs BUT THIS WAS GREAT LOL
kurtis is on his rebellion arc huh
Wtf Kurtis how could you PURPOSELY not give an extra greeting i cant believe you i’m unsubscribing since apparently theres no point anymore 😔😔😔😔
You should've picked another barbie movie kurtis
Instead of an extra greeting start every video with a new reason why you arent a virgin
Welcome back mullet man
“MATtell me that” got me 😂😂😂
I've never clicked on anything so fast in my life
I'm so glad you chose that bratz movie, my absolute favourite of all the bratz
Where's the extra greeting kurtis?
kurtis is in denial it’s okay kurtis there are plenty of people who are virgins
THe princess and the popper was the best barbie movie
Untill I get my extra greeting, I'm unsubscribing
this isn't a video i was expecting but i'm grateful anyways
I didn’t get an extra greeting... guess I’m unsubscribing  🙄
“for a v long time Barbie didn’t really have any competition— until the year 2001 when Bratz dolls...” Jem & the Holograms: 👁👄👁
VRG stands for Virginia because that’s where Kurtis is from
why are Kurtis' eyes sticking out so much?
But we all know monster high is the best
I have a muffin
I guess...
very good kurtis 😹👍
kurtis could just make a whole video of him running in front of a green screen and i'd watch the whole video and enjoy it
Well, I didn't get a second hello, it's time to unsubscribe. I love you Kurtis but your channel is probably gonna go down hill from this point rip   Lmao being sarcastic if it wasn't obvious, keep doing what you love <3
Ok Kurtis you don't know what this means to me. Bratz??!yes boi
The fact that this time it wasn’t even a mistake. Kurtis CHOSE to not do an extra greeting and all of you just stand there? I get it we’re human we make mistakes, but Kurtis, I can’t keep defending you. I’m done. #kurtisconnerisoverparty
interesting intro...
Welcome one and all to the super ultimate smackdown showdown between… *off mic* Am I reading this right you can’t be serious? *mumbles* you gotta be sh!tting me here  BRATZ VS BARBIES let’s get ready to rumbleeeee
maybe
Im early yay
also i love ur mustache
kurtis why dont you ma-tell me when youre getting rid of your moustache
no
Yo Danny seems really upset that he's a virgin. Maybe he should eat some takis. They're seriously instense.
“Give him to me, eEUuUUuGghhH 😩”
hi kurtis🧍🏾‍♀️
yes
#kurtisconnerisoverparty
the reason im early is bc u always post the same day danny posts
I never really liked bratz because they had huge heads and tiny torsos and i just thought they looked weird. Also I didn’t like that they were called bratz cause who wants to be a brat? idk
Bratz are cooler, but Barbie in the Princess and the Pauper is the best movie of all time.
i really like this video so far !! thank you kurtis :)
I’m okay with one less greeting
not him actually putting the vrg disclaimer 😭
“could a virgin have a podcast?” they invented them, kurty boy.
Woop
DUDE. I WOULD BUY A FUCKING BRATZ DOLL. I'M SO GLAD THEY'RE COMING BACK??
Kurtis not giving us an extra greeting is the definition of evil, knowing Kurtis is in control is a rude awakening /j
Kurtis on his way to sue God for creating Mondays🏃🏃
That stache is coming in strong
Watching silently
Kurtis Conner? more like Kurtis Conner lmao
I think that Barbie movies are better but Bratz dolls are better. (But Bratz movies/shows are also ✨gold✨) (actually i don't know i love both)
https://youtu.be/b4RgFx5yJZw
The answer is Monster High.
Kurtis bud tone it down, this is a tad TOO funny
Kurtis really said „I respect the virgin community, but it ain’t me, sis ✨💅
kurtis not including the extra greeting on purpose is such a power move
I love how Reboxy.Work makes people happy also rich😍 完璧

Soulja boy invented both
very bold of you to put two of the best barbie and bratz movies in the thumbnail, kurtis
Ok virg
i told my sister (who loves barbie and bratz) that you made a new video called barbie vs bratz and she went "...oh... he's gonna start a war."
No more extra greeting? Rebellious Kurt!!
kurtis why are you becoming a country dad 😣😥
Imagine having a Barbie that is full of farts and then explodes randomly
very cool kurtis.
2:35 reminded me of the girl who licked the toilet seat… Craig.. 😒😒
I love how Reboxy.Work makes people happy also rich😍 完璧
i had barbie toothpaste, it did not do its job
kurtis looks a bit like Dr disrespect these days
am i early-
Kurtis is here rocking what i can only describe as a mini mullet,and i am here for it.
kurtis purposely not giving an extra greeting ON PRIDE MONTH... #kurtisconnerisoverparty
I love how Reboxy.Work makes people happy also rich😍 完璧
I hope Kurtis doesn’t stop saying his extra greeting after this....
His mustache distracts me
'Mattel me that' is literally the best catchphrase for any barbie villian
Ye
kurtis i feel so betrayed... no extra greeting
this is the most enticing and clickable thumbnail i've seen from kurtis
Italian
I love how Reboxy.Work makes people happy also rich😍 完璧
I love how Reboxy.Work makes people happy also rich😍 完璧
I love how Reboxy.Work makes people happy also rich😍 完璧
When I saw you posted, I felt happiness in it's purest form. I clicked on the video, excited, for I knew I had this stability in my life, I knew I would always get a second greeting. I'm now 50 seconds into the video and I have never felt greater betrayal or heartbreak
I love how Reboxy.Work makes people happy also rich😍 完璧
I will not tolerate Otto slander. He was the funniest thing in that Barbie movie
I love how Reboxy.Work makes people happy also rich😍 完璧
Sorry for third comment but I have to let you know they already make dolls with buttholes and have been since the advent of the doll unfortunately lol
when you start saying that a doll is too hot for your kids to have, that's when you gotta pack it in bc you're a weirdo that shouldn't have had kids omfg
Random people: .....He didn't say the greeting for Kurtis town....... *Freaks out*  Kurtis: yeah I'm sorry and I'm in charge so....  Those random people: *cancels Kurtis*
"ya hooo da ba yo"
Hello :)
I love how Reboxy.Work makes people happy also rich😍 完璧
I love Bratz but... Come on. Barbie and the 12 dancing princesses? Mariposa? Barbie and the Pegasus? Get out of here, Bratz, you don't stand a chance
Early for once wow-
When I was a kid I was definitely a Barbie girl but still played with Bratz. Now as a 25 year old I'm still obsessed with Bratz I think they're rad.
girls who played with bratz dollz are all bad bitches now i don’t make the rules
babe wake up new kurtis conner video dropped
now i gotta look like this 👁👄👁
This video is so outa pocket
2:53 …is that the community flag?
i haven't watched the vid yet lol
guys I thought that we already established Kurtis was not a virgin when he didn't know how to put on the voice to text for streaming🙄🤚🏻
ty for feeding us father
Thanks for making my post surgery suck less by posting
new upload pog?
kurtistown needs our own barbies where its just a mini kurtis that farts
I thought it said Virgo….. moving on
I don't think I will live to the end of this video without the extra greeting
i never realized vrg DIDNT mean virgin…
The fart sound killed me 🤣
i know barbara millicent roberts personally. do not slander her name. this is your first warning…
finally, the virgin uploaded a new video
FOLKS 👏🏾
kurtis please we need an extra greeting 😭
AYOO MAYOR KURTIS SHOWING DOMINANCE WITH NO EXTRA GREETING 🗣‼️
not the blatant lack of extra greeting
I just wanna know what compelled Kurtis to make this video
Early gang y’all
Kurtis is living a life of a 10 year old first disney now barbie and bratz
Glad to know Kurtis is a vrg. I'm a Capricorn!
Where’s the extra greeting?
I remember the adult swim parody where Bratz ran over Barbie with a car and Monster High ran over Bratz- it was so funny y’all should check it out after Kurts vid
the mustache is looking very really good
Kurtis is starting to look like someone’s southern estranged uncle
kurtis youre awesome
Kurty just shattered toxic masculinity into pieces 🗣
KURTIS, WE NEED THE EXTRA GREETING
skipping the extra greeting seemed to give kurtis more freedom to joke around and be funny surprisingly??
The answer is: BARBIE 100%
That's not an asshole! That's the flag of Greendale Community College!
I'm hurt that I didn't get an extra greeting :(
Bratz ofc, but Barbie cool.
Mattell me that!- Kurtis Connor 2021
Robert
You guys I don't know about you, but I'm taking this abuse to twitter once again #CurtisKonnerisvirginparty
That's a lot of explaining for someone who's really not a virgin Kurtis
catering to ur demographic
Oh my gosh this mustache, I can't focus on anything else besides it
im actually pissed i didnt get an extra greeting. im leaving kurtis town and going to........... vrg town
Kurtis standing up for himself with the extra greeting like the virgin he is! Go Kurt!
cool video!
Bratz fashion pixies is the best bratz movie there is. Don't fight me
YES I needed that
wow kurtis, you really woke up and chose violence, i support it fully
Team Barbie!!!
fun fact: at this point no one has finished watching this video
finally, a kurtis connor video suited to my specific interest. i love dolls
You currently look like a dude I would see at a truck stop/gas station that spits on the ground and then makes eye contact for too long as I walk by but also doesn’t say anything to me at all
Love that you dropped your second greeting - I feel like you’ve been wanting to for a hot minute now. 🙌🏻 (I mean I love it either way, lmao.)
holy shit im early... less than 5k views
hell yeah new kurtis
Kurtis is a virgin confirmed???
So we're just going to let him get away with not giving us our extra greeting? Yes. Yes we are.
No extra greeting?? 🤨😒
EARLLYY
I'm grieving my extra greeting
barbies v bratz? the girls are fighting i see
vrg means “very really gay,” happy pride month everyone 🥰🏳️‍🌈
guys it sounds like Kurtis is a virgin :/
cannot believe that i subscribed for an extra greeting and it was denied to me in this video. unbelievable kurtis
Mayor of fucking Kurtis Town! 🤪
Only a virgin would have those letters in the background and be so insecure about it
Unsubscribed
Me when Kurtis doesn’t do an extra greeting:  “We’ve been tricked, we’ve been backstabbed and we’ve been quite possibly, bamboozled.”
Virgin kurtis
Mayor- how long are you keeping that mustache-?
i am entertained
Can i eat your taco Kurtis 😩🥺🥺
ya hooo da ba yo
me reading the title: NO HE DIDNT HE- I- DANG OKAY
Kurtis looks like the villain cop that doesn't believe in Santa
This video is SERIOUSLY intense
*doesnt get an extra greeting but knows it's on his own terms* 🥺👍😔
the rat mullet and stache are really starting to grow on me.......
kurtis: im not a virgin  source: trust me bro
Lmao vrg disclaimer
Barbie movies now looks like fever dreams I'd have on LSD.... Idk how I liked em when I was a child 😭
Kurtis is becoming a country boy right before our eyes
Since we don’t get an extra greeting anymore, what’s the point of subscribing if we don’t get anything back in return 🤬🗣💁🏻‍♀️
Everyone tell me their favorite barbie movie, personally mine is Barbie in a Mermaid Tale <3
the child in me is short-circuiting
Scoot Cramer, Danny Gonzalez and kurtis wow what’s next …..
folks 👏    this comment is our extra greeting since kurtis won’t do it himself 🙄
So, the extra greeting was all a lie, huh🥺
I feel so empty without my extra greeting 😔
hi kurtis
👀 I want my extra greeting ‼😑😑
LMAO he’s so sick of the greeting
bratz >>>>>>
thank you for this kurtis
I’m convinced Kurtis is stalking me. I was just talking about barbies and bratz earlier…
As a Kurtis Town citizen, having my  extra greeting taken from me has devastated me. What’s next? No greeting AT ALL??? This town has gone to the dogs
i CANNOT believe you didn’t give us an extra greeting.
This virgin is going off the rails in the first minute
kurtboy always doing the dirty digging for us Thank you for ur service king
Okay the title caught my attention
Damn, i never realized I'd miss that extra greeting........**teardrops**
Hi kurt boy love u
rip extra greeting💔💔 we missed u today💔💔
Kurtis I'm crying rn very much and just got into a car accident and died because i didn't get an extra getting  :(
One second into the video and already smashing that like button. You know it's going to be a good vid when it's from our Major.
no extra greeting? I'm not watching the rest of the video/j
kurtis. you can't get away with this. give us back our extra greeting!!!
when ur early 😎🥵😤🥶😍🙏🏻🤪🤓😶‍🌫️😱🤯🤤😵‍💫🤧
THE EXTRA GREETING... I NEED THE EXTRA GREETING😭😭😭😭😢
I'm so early I'm gonna cause an unplanned pregnancy
danny and kurtis in one day? now we wait for drew
You intentionally didnt do the extra greeting, which is ten times worse than forgetting!!!  If I had a lawyer, I would sue.  My day is now ruined
Ooh I’ve never been this early and I can’t think of anything to say 🪱
Kurtis… is everything ok at home?
No extra greeting at the beginning of each video? *Unsubscribe*
YOUR MULLET IS AN ABSOLUTE BANGER, KURTIS
barbies movies from like the earlyish 2000s are so iconic gn
Oh god, not my childhood again…
the battle of the century😕
I had to resist a bundle that had two sashas and you post this smh wtf I knew it was a sign wtf wow kurtis Conner. Posting about bratz. What timeline even is this? Simulation must be running on that iOS
no..no extra ...greeting..? 😔 oh....ok then
you dont have to do the greeting, its your channel king
ANOTHER VIDEO ‼
#KurtisConnerIsOverAgainParty
ya hooo da ba yo
30 minutes of barbies and bratz. i’m here, babes.
BARTZ ARE MY FAVOURITE 😭💓✨💕
Green?
Purposefully not giving us an extra greeting? Unsubscribing 😡😡
I'm so sad I didn't get my extra greeting but it's ok mr.mayor you make the rules ig 😭
Dam the new Avengers movie looking really good 😯😯😯🔥🔥🔥🔥🥶
This is the year of Barbie.
virgin really good
now i feel like danny drew and kurtis purposely post on the same day. maybe they are the same person.....
barbies and Bratz dolls creep me out
my guy went from AI to barbie vs bratz, now that’s what i call RANGE
its not a kurtis conner video if he doesnt stare into your soul 👹
hello
i cant tell if i want to look like kurtis conner of if i would avoid him in public at all costs
what the frick why no extra greeting
i thought it stood for virgo 😭
If he says anything bad about preminger I dont know how I'll react
kurtboy got a new video and im already liking the title
Hey Kurt!
And now we wait for Drew to upload
Sorry Kurt, but I subscribed for the extra greeting. I just don't see the point in being subbed anymore, sorry😔
no extra greeting? i feel empty inside. that doesn’t have anything to do with having no extra greeting tho
Man this dudes comedy very really good!
No extra greeting?!  Im unsubbing >:(
Read the entire Wikipedia
but pls shave that moustache kurtis i know you don't like minors 🥺
we have been summoned
#kurtisconnerisoverparty
rip the intro
THANK YOU MR MAYOR FOR ANOTHER VIDEO
The last time I was that fast Kurtis was only first getting familiar with tik tok...
IM EARLYY
virgin really good 🤫🤫
I hope he won’t talk shit about barbie movies in this video, otherwise I’ll have to unsubscribe😔
I have never been more upset at a content creator than I am right now
i feel like there's a gaping hole in my life where the extra greeting used to be
Don't you dare compare the iconic barbie movies to the bratz movie, they're two different cultural resets
#kurtisconnerisoverparty
a danny upload and kurtis upload on the same day??? 😩🙏🙏
HI KURTIS LOVE U
kurtis is going rouge
THE BRATZ ANIMATION GIVES ME NIGHTMARES.
Guys, I think Kurtis might not be a virgin...
No extra greeting….DISLIKE 👎  …..😤😤😤👶😤😤😤👶😤😤
Ahhh Kurtis I love Barbie movies I've been waiting for the king to make a video like this👑
bratz over barbie any day. not because i like bratz and dont like barbie, but because mattel is a pretty garbage company. the monster high reboot wont save them, and mga is thriving. they dont need to copy (cough mattel) and reboot to thrive (bratz isnt being brought back because money unlike mattel bringing back monster higj. both have huge demand to come back but mga has multiple lines that do great, a bratz comeback is just what fans wanted, and so far its been a great comeback, monster high weve not got anything yet, but my hopes arent high at all considering the rest of current mattels quality)
hey what's up
#tagavirgin @kurtisconner
My my my, kurtsi connect posted
barbie better it rhymes so its true
Kurtisconnerisoverparty AGAIN
he always seem to post videos whenever i feel down. thanks kurtis. thanks. <3
WAOT WAIT WIAT  NO EXTRA GREETING?  DURING PRIDE MONTH??????
swag
you trying to convince us you aren’t a virgin reallyyyy makes me think you are XD
I feel privileged, i saw this video before i even got the notification that it was posted
Kurtis, Danny, and Scott all posting at the same time😳
I love Bratz so much and collect them, so I’m a lil afraid of whatcha gotta say Kurt boi Edit: hehe Kurt approves I’m good
Kurtis  *pin this if you like purple ketchup*
Hello kurtis
Plot twist: it actually stands for west Virginia
I am now going to watch this video. Hopefully it is good  Update: Very funny
Small soldiers was terrifying.    But the blonde chick shaped my ‘type’
but wait... the extra greeting? 🥺 we can part ways, it’s okay
Daz Games, Danny and Kurtis in the same day???!!! Is it the end of days or something?
NOOOO
kurtis the piss kink haver
The people who dislike are people who are mad that they didn't get an extra greeting
well shit.. here we go again #kurtisconnerisoverpartypart2
No extra greeting? Unsubscribed. Kurtistown will riot.
I like girls
Im early asf! Leggo
WITHOUT WATCHING BARBIES ARE ON TOP EVERYTIME AND ANYTIME
Lets gooo new kurtis vid
Not first but probably the coolest here ngl
this is going to be epic
Every time kuris grows his mustache he needs to change his name to earl
the special greeting being gone this video will make it that much better next time 🥲😔❤️
As someone who used to be planning on going into toy design: modern barbie is THE WORST and MGA is eating them up with bratz's spiritual descendants, LOL OMG and rainbow high dolls
as soon as I saw the title I clicked so fast ong-
>:(
bratz all the way not even a question
im used to watching kurtis’s streams so its weird watching his videos
YouTube: this video has 184 comments. Mr: may I see them YouTube: no
I absolutely hate you for not giving me my intro 🤢 unsubscribing!   /j
KURTIS. NO. I SIGNED UP FOR MY EXTRA GREETING AND I WANT IT.
Who in tf disliked 🙄
no extra greeting ☹️ i forgive you though
guys he's not a virgin
Lmao posted 50 seconds ago and already at 255 comments. Oof wow Kurtis, good job
0:25 you betrayed me, and I know that you’ll never feel sorry for the way I hurt 😔
Early 🙋‍♀️i have a life i promise 😂
no extra greeting :,((
Admit ur a virgin
Damn I've never been this early before
This video does not feel complete without the intro
we know it stands for virgin, kurtis
Kurtis Connor? More like Kurtis Connor.
give me my extra greeting now
u really hurt my feelings with the lack of intro… i’m moving out of kurtistown
The barbie movies are the best!
kurtis you were in the spider-man movie with andrew garfield
EXTRA GREETING PLEASE
vrg=virgin
O no r we loosing the greeting
Finally, the content we have been looking for , from our virgin king !!
I don’t know Kurtis.....”I’m not a virgin” sounds like exactly what a VIRGIN would say
3 views and 368 comments? wow yall working hard
I have chigcken
Kurtis, how am I receiving an extra greeting every video, yet I am not subscribed? Please help, this is confusing. I’m in a constant state of worry.
No extra greeting 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
AY WHERE TF IS MY EXTRA GREETING. IM NOT OKAY WITH THIS KURTIS.
Kurtis tryna tell us he isn't virgin is hilarious 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
kurtis.... no extra greeting??? jail.
the content i was waiting for
Love the video! You should make one about the fever dream that is the live action Dudley Do-Right
Barbie will always be superior. Ken being the icon that he is definitely helps with that
unsubscribing without the second greeting
#kurtisconnerisoverparty
hiiiii im early i love you in a frendly way
dang kurtis, skipping the extra greeting? who are you😞
I feel so incomplete, no extra greeting
2 weeks feels like forever </3
THANK YOU KURTIS‼️‼️‼️‼️❤️❤️
KURTIS EXTRA EXTRA HELLO FROM YOUR SUBS ❤️❤️   Edit: WHY IS THERE NO EXTRA GREETING???

i’m heartbroken why did you not do the extra greeting on purpose
hi ilysm
Do the fucking extra greeting kurtis 🔪
Hi dad
BRATZ>>>🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
This is exactly the quality content I've come to expect ✌😌
Not getting the extra greeting really diminishes my sub value. What am I subbing for now?
never thought Kurt boy would ever talk about barbie movies… wild crossover
53 seconds ago, sheeesh

hi kurtis
I feel betrayed
IM HERE SO EARLY YAY.

AYO VIRGIN CHECK😍
First Danny, and now Kurtis? Man, I love it in Kurtistown.
Oh yeah I've been waiting for someone to talk about this
thank you for the content virgin Kurt
Sup
So…I thought he learned his lesson about giving all Kurtistown members an extra greeting at the beginning of every video so we can press the subscribe button for an extra greeting.
Right, before even watching this imma just say Bratz have always been superior, they were diverse and iconic
Barbie is a youtuber now? 😐
YUHHHH NEW KURTIS AND DANNY VIDEO??/?.)
ok bratz over barbie but monster high were superior😳
I thought this said Barbz and I jumped
ur the only guy who looks good with a mullet this is weird
Barbie 100% very really better than bratz   Edit: Except that bratz are objectively better I just have princess and the pauper nostalgia  Edit 2: Barbie and Rapunzel is so good omg when she made that dress Wow so cool you know if you know  Edit 3: you chose wrong kurtis very disappointing only 4/10 smh
Barbie or Bratz - its still better than Tarantino
g.i joe is better
As a 2000s girl, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
FLEX I WAS THE 15 VIEWER
NO THE EXTRA GREETING
FINALLY SOMEONE TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANT CONTROVERSIES 😤😤
