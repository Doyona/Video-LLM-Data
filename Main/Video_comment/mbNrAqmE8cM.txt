I sorta new Cole would win cus it was easier to sell him as a good guy. If there’s a good guy and bad guy in one of these the good guy usually wins
Battle of my two favorite Edgelords!
i am 2 years late, i legit was thinking this was a mismatch, i never thought Cole would stand a chance against Alex lol
0:40 - 6:42 - 12:58
0:40 - 6:42 - 12:58
15:57 16:00 16:02
It's a shame, of course, since I was on Mercer's side, but congratulations to Cole's fans. I'd like to see Cole's beast and Alex's beast.
Song was complete assssse
Uk prototype randomly people infamous would of been destroyed instantly in the begging  of the fight
Next: Nue Houjuu vs Kogasa Tatara (Undefined Fantastic Object vs Sunken Fossil World) (Death Battle/Touhou Project Showdown!)
I'm playing the games again because NEW  PROTOTYPE GAME LEAKS LESGOOO
Been watching this series ever since it was first created and....damn to this day i cant say which animation i enjoy the most, 100% satisfaction and dedication and inspiration in each episode, despite how accurate the outcome is for either character. This is what dreams are made of❤
I think something thats left out is Alex being able to use other infected to his advantage. Alex had a whole city to his advantage. As Heller showed a primary infected can call in other infected.
This is cool and all but let's be honest, Cole is NOWHERE near that fast. He is literally running at a jogging pace. Cole will literally get eaten up in 2 seconds.
seeing boomstick laugh when 69 was mentioned is surreal cuz now mfs be going crazy if they see or hear 67
how did cole regenerate getting stabbed in the chest 😂😂
It's a crime that the reason both of these franchises died is because Sony though CONCORD was a better product.
I am  Glad the electric guy won the battle the parasite guy was too much like a rip-off of venom
Its been like 17 years,let it die 🙏
Man won by ang lee hulking him
A bike messenger with electrokinesis vs A scientist infected with a symbiotic virus.
Coal my goat.
Cole Macgrath is basically the Spider-Man of Sony
Bs
but this is just good vs evil and good always win , but james haller definitely smashed him , and in this also alex can easily break free from ice and he never die
Happy to say I have now played at least part of both of these goats of gaming
I played Prototype but never got to play iNFAMOUS. I want to play it after watching this 😅
13:40 flavor-fail. Cole should’ve been the one to use the Blanka Ball.
bummer that Hello fresh is not in Canada.
Wolverine reference 15:46
I feel like Alex should have won that realistically
Asmongold would pick alex since what happened to sucker punch
Alax Mercer ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Alex shoulda won
I like that throught all the fight alex never try to ripped off some of cole limps ( if i remberber correctly conductors cant regenerate entire limps )
Dude i loved this fight COLE IS AWESOME!!!
Honestly there is one reason why I think Alex might win...he'd just assume Zeke's personalyity after getting nearly killed by Cole and just take him out when his guard his down. Cole is like a demi-god, But Alex is a beast that hunts and stalks its prey .
Whats the music they use for the ad hello fresh, with the saxophone?
"like Goku's Muffin Button" 2:13
predicxtion: mercer wins, becasue as long as there are people to eat, there is life to mercer.  edit: oh so cole turns matter into energy... well thats... nice... >_<
**** weird **** rambling ****
**** you very **** man ****
Peak cinema 🙌
Now if this was James Heller, especially post-Alex Mercer absorption, he'd obliterate Cole.
I’m sorry, but why did I see a live action Cole Magrath for 3 seconds?!?!?!
Even though Cole Macgrath is stronger than Alex Mercer, I still like and love Alex Mercer more.
They should either remaster both series 1-2 or add a 3rd (reboot maybe)
Damn I would have loved to see Alex Mercer pitted against Steven Armstrong.
So we are skipping all of Cole’s red lightning and vampiric powers? I guess he didn’t need them 😂
Need Delsin Rowe vs James Heller now asap
Y’all gotta do another one of these with the infamous second son Maine character vs the prototype 2 main character. It’s a must and very needed
Cole's Death was the biggest insult to players I've seen in some time because his sacrifice was, essentially, for nothing.  He killed himself to bring about the end of the Conduit virus, but come Second Son, it's back and has mutated to turn people into conduits so the entire plot point of Cole sacrificing himself is a slap in the face.
meh i like the evil ending more f tht good crap
Now I want to watch evil Cole dominate Alex.
Sucks that infamous is stuck on PS3. It's truly an amazing game
They were supposed to actually have a crossover game but Sony dumped it for the failure known ad concord
Concord kept us from greatness
Whoever wins I just assume the other guy was supposed to win because death battle is just false😪
They forgot that cole became a vampire
Really good games like hulk ultimate destruction 😢
Realistically I think alex would have cut him up. Quick. Hes not exactly a showboat he likes to kill quick
How about Alex Mercer against venom
for Second Son, I feel like they could've made a whole online world for it. Final Fantasy 15 did it. I think sucker punch could've capitalized off Second Son with that, instead of giving us that DLC nobody really remembers. Too their core, all the conduit powers were the same, but It would've been nice.
i honestly dont think cole wouldve won simply because unlesss you also had the virus you couldnt kill him no matter what. that final stab shouldve been the end in my opinion
they just nerf alex mercer
I mean making it good Cole vs Alex Merced is already a debuff. Ice ain’t do nothing against fleshy virus
Oh, i see why i originally disliked this video
Nonsense
I always imagined how epic a Mordekaiser vs Sauron fight would be
Before watching: Sick. Also, there better be hella traversal. EDIT: After watching: Nice.
2025 anyone
Johnny ohm vs elektro
GO COLE MACGRATH GO KICK HIS VIRUS ASS DUDE
12:58 Battle Begins
Who came back to this after finding out infamous and prototype are coming back
Can we get a fight of evil Cole against Alex
*Alex holding Coles head*  "Imma throw him."  "Not gonna crush his head"   "Na."
Now we need James Heller to step up from prototype 2
Never seen these two characters before, nor have I seen this Death Battle before, but MAN if they did not have some fire lines.  I think I still have room for dessert. Buddy you are one sick freak!  What a nightmare You don't know the HALF of it!  So much POWER! And yet you WASTE it on these VERMIN! You and I could change this world for the better!  The only vermin I see is YOU!  If you don't want to GIVE me your power? FINE I'll just TAKE IT!  Good idea!  This world isn't perfect, but it's a lot better without you in it.  This was a great death battle, that final fight felt so superhero-ish. A LOT better than just about every fight in modern superhero films. It flowed, it showed their powers, and they exchanged some witty banter back and forth that was not awkward or stilted.  Thanks Death Battle!
I still think it's simple. Alex has many minions/copies. If one Alex won't do, an army might. An initial clash may fail. But it's not the only way to fight. Cool as heck games though
Imagine seeing this in 2010
Alex mercer has a cool outfit
imagine if they gave him some of Kessler's power
By the laws of physics and viruses tho, Cole would find no bioelectricity to leech from Alex since Viruses run purely off of chemical energy. Through heating him up alot you could get some results but it's not going to kill Alex since it's not his power source, Cole has more powerful ranged attacks but at close range he's still very human without proxy of his powers, another thing is that Cole resisting atomic destruction isn't really saying much given that Alex doesn't really have to rip him apart per say, a virus can just invade his cells and replicate conduit gene behavior or just simply eat him from the inside out, if Cole was completely biologically inert he would be literally dead so resistance to atomic separation doesn't always mean resistance to viruses/infection or biological warfare at the molecular level. An example would be in Viltrimites from the invincible universe, they have what are called smart atoms which allow them to literally control the behavior of their atoms like increasing density and whatnot for the sake of their powers but were still plagued and almost wipe out by a space virus.
Alex wins Cole has plot armor
I wonder if Alex could become a Conduit if he touched Cole though, I was figuring that is what was gonna happen and then I would figure that Alex would win since he would have all his powers, plus Cole's, even if he didn't have as much practice with them
miss my salt snoring eletromaster
Coming back to this. It’s pretty clear that they really wanted to make Kratos vs Asura so they dogged on the two series as much as possible. Or at least Liam did.
the more is see mercer fighting the more i think he let heller win
no jodas haganle doblaje a estoooo
This video looks old asl
Light...wins
When are you going to put Jame from Prototype 2 ?
After playing prototype 1, there is a boss battle inside an infected hive against Specialist Cross. He uses an electric baton, and guess what it does? Pushes Mercer back if you get too close, or zaps you if you use your whipfist.   Pretty much Cole wins instantly because Mercer isn't strong against electricity.
i disagree
Icey Cold Electro VS Virus Infected Carnage
With the supposed new prototype game coming out, I'd like to imagine if it was always Alex's plan to get to either consumed or be consumed while having fun doing it. He is the virus.could maybe open the game to an  A.F.O. Shigaraki takeover type mental battle.
16:00 It was that point Alex knew…he (Bleep)’d up.
I am curious was Alex’s actor sounding like Barry Pepper or Daryl Kurlyo? I can’t tell.
I couldn't help but chuckle at 4:24.
16:00 HELL YES
samanoske vs nightmare next
gaming was onto something when studios were making superstreethero movies.
As soon as i saw Alex use his special 10 seconds into the fight i knew he was gonna lose lol
Alex should’ve won. Not because he’s actually stronger or anything, just because he looks infinitely cooler
Awesome sauce
I like that Cole is the Hero here
Y'all should do the agent from the "Crackdown" series vs the  main character from the "Crysis" series/prototype series all those interchangeable for death batttles
It's a shame that the guy who had the collective intelligence of dozens of scientists and the experience of literally hundreds of special ops agents and soldiers was played so stupid. I thought experience was one of the most important stats in this show
12:58 you're welcome.
What's the song
they really need to remaster the infamous games instead of tlou.
Never forget that when popular game critic Yahtzee Croshaw reviewed these games, he saw lots of similarities but couldn't decide which was better. So, to settle his tie, he requested that the developers of each game send him a picture of the opposite game's protagonist wearing a woman's bra, and the better picture would decide the winner.    And they actually did it
I dont know what is the musique in de fight scene but i like this song
I actually wanted Cole to win as much as I love Alex Mercer
I thought Cole had napalm and doesn’t he have two sets low karma and high karma
fun fact: alex mercer was supposed to be peter parker this was supposed to be spider-man web of shadows 2
Eh I saw that coming. They spelled out how he could counter everything Alex could dish out, im disappointed but not surprised
As much of a Prototype fan as I am, yeah, Alex just didn't have what it takes to bring down Cole. I really hope we get a game like it again in the future. That sandbox was just too much fun to never be revisited. It really was the best series to give us shape shifting as a superpower.
im a year late and im still over here like finally they did this
NGL, this masterpieces need a remaster. Annoying hoe tlou keeps getting remakes.
I think Alex mercer wins they didn't  have the budget to show what he could do
Do Ultron vs Brainiac next
Alex isn't dead. His arms were ripped off before he was absorbed by Heller. Last I checked, 2 arms is a lot more than a single cell.
They need to revive Cole in the infamous games
Cole MacGrath vs. Alex Mercer (Sony's InFamous vs. Activation Blizzard and Microsoft's Prototype)
Fun fact, evil Cole is worse and more evil than Alex
I’m sorry dude. Love both games but Alex Mercer would 100 percent mow over Cole. Cole is not fast enough by any means unless they nerfed his locomotion for smaller map size. Cole can barely withstand being shot by bullets before he needs to recharge to heal. And bioelectrial drain only works once the enemy is completely weakened. And on that note Cole has no super strength only force generated through electricity that drains very quickly.  Evil Cole is the only version of Cole that could stand toe to toe again Alex Mercer that could end in a draw but if 1 molecule of Alex Survives he can regenerate by connect to a living creature
It's two of the most best games ever fight each other. God, i miss these games. But at the same time, i think it was for the best that the games ended when they did, at there best.
COLE MACGRATH MY GOAT🐐👑
Forget Cole, Zeke is clearly far beyond a normal human, and we don't even know his power
pls do tokyo revengers vs wind braker
One word: Cooool!
Say what you will, but Mercer survived a damn nuke. He for sure wins.
Loved the video! But Alex would def win tbh
Shame we will never know as lore in Infamous is shaky at best, with Cole defeating superior opponents but mobs being able to shrug off his attacks. While Alex was completely dogged in Prototype 2. Damn I hate Heller's arc.
Spoiler block 🚫
How tf is there not a single comment pointing out that this battle actually started with Yahtzee from Zero Punctuation (now Fully Ramblomatic) and his lingerie contest where the developers of each franchise had to illustrate the rival character in lingerie lol
hehe angry virus boy
Now we need James (prototype 2) vs Delsin (infamous Second son)
Plot armor
Nice vid, but let's be honest: Alex Mercer is almost 2 times stronger than Cole McGrath))
This don’t add up yall bias and why cuz he was a villain there no way he can beat Alex, have yall played both games how would tht drop hurt him no drop hurts him and in that form there nothing tht can hurt the man
Dont worry guys, the virus only affects cells, the ray sphere absorbed potential conduits powers on the molecular level and cole survived the explosion that was designed to leave him alive with the power of dead conduits so he wins.... that was silly. MIND CONTROL IS SIMILAR TO A VIRUS, oh dear god.
Venom vs prototype
Yeeeeaahh! My boy Cole!
Honestly, while I respect the effort in this animation, the result feels quite inaccurate when you deeply analyze both characters based on their actual abilities and lore.  Alex Mercer is biologically superior to Cole MacGrath in almost every way:  Mercer can regenerate from almost any form of damage, including full dismemberment and even a nuclear bomb. His healing factor is borderline absurd.  His offensive capabilities are far more versatile: claws, blade arms, hammerfists, tendrils, biomass projectiles, groundspikes, shield, armor, and the ability to consume any biological target instantly.  He's much stronger physically, able to toss tanks, rip helicopters apart, and blitz enemies at superhuman speeds.  Cole, on the other hand:  Is limited by his electrical energy reserve. If drained, he's extremely vulnerable.  While he can generate very destructive attacks (like Ionic Storms, Lightning Tornado, etc), they require charge buildup and are mostly long-range.  His durability, while above normal humans, is nowhere close to Mercer's regenerative feats.  Cole has no "consume" or "energy absorption" ability that would let him steal Mercer's powers or biomass. That scene in the video where Cole somehow pulls Mercer’s biomass in is completely fabricated — that ability simply does not exist in the inFamous lore.  The major issue with this animation:  It heavily nerfs Alex Mercer’s aggression and regeneration while giving Cole non-canon abilities.  In a realistic fight, Mercer would close the distance quickly and force a brutal close-combat scenario where Cole's ranged advantage becomes almost useless.  Best case scenario for Cole:  He lands an incredibly powerful, fully charged Ionic Storm or similar attack early in the fight before Mercer can get close. Even then, Alex may regenerate unless completely vaporized.  Realistically: Mercer takes the win 8/10 times due to overwhelming regeneration, offensive variety, strength, durability, and close-range dominance.  Bottom line: Fun animation, but the scaling here doesn’t do justice to how absurdly broken Alex Mercer really is.  If we ever got a canon inFamous vs Prototype crossover, it’d be brutal.
One gripe I have with the video is the canon ending is the evil ending, otherwise how would second son become a thing? Also, in second son there's an electronic store in the city where Cole McGrath had set up shop. He never sacrificed himself for the humans, he basically became the savior of the conduits.
This fight reminds me of this one blog I read of this guy being a real snarky dickhead about how much better Mercer was than Cole. I wonder if he's seething righ tnow.
4:26 Boomstick that was your old character you were gonna have to face it eventually
This death battle is full of bs
Bs
I’m sorry but in no way does Cole beat Alex
Would he be able to throw lightning strikes like Luffy
Can we talk about coles power swords I’ve apparently never heard about? What are they called so i can research?
Now do Delson Rowe vs James Heller!
If Alex ate just some of his DNA he could copy his powers.
90% sure the guy who voiced alex also voiced shadow in that one jojo's/sonic video mashed did a couple years back
The soundtrack for this fight  had me straight pumped
Let’s face the facts, this world has too many Alex Mercers, and not enough Cole MacGraths.
I hope there’s another but instead of Alex Mercer put in James heller
when cole enters the office building you can hears a faint cry of pain meaning that someone was in there and alex killed them to replenish his biomass reserves a real blink and ya miss it moment
They really don’t make games like these anymore…. Now all they make is FPS games and fps survival games… getting really boring
Playing both games imma guess Alex wins but I don't think I have nearly all the info just a guess
inFAMOUS is the INVINCIBLE of Superhero Video Games & [PROTOTYPE] is the THE BOYS of Superhero Video Games
Alex Mercer, Cole MacGrath, Starkiller:   The power fantasy edgelord characters of the 2000s. God I miss this era.
as someone who love both Infamous and Prototype i think Cole MacGrath vs Alex Mercer is very peak death battle video its a 10/10 episode.
How about Delsin vs Alex
So happy my boy won
Delsin Vs. Kevin 11
I think alex mercer would win if it actually happened
the quote at the end "Good idea" GOES SO HARD
I love both the games but i need another prototype game. That time of gaming was amazing and the trailers had these amazing movie like cinematics.
Does someone know what is the song during the fight?
Now Delsin vs Heller
This channel has a lot of misses but this is a good one
Hey Dudes & Dudettes now who is in & watching in 2025📹📡🛰📡📺💻📱🖥.!?¡¿ ♤♡♧◇€£₩¥☆
so the protagonist of infamous eventually became famous? heh, interesting
prototype u alright.? U seem like cole a bit.?
hey "DEATHBATTLE" how about you make Delsin Rowe vs James Heller (Infamous: second son vs Prototype 2) please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please
Sad they didn’t get the crossover game they were supposed to have
nah alex had to win
Remember kids, DO NOT PUT YOUR FINGERS IN A LIVE SOCKET!!!
I love Cole buuuut I gotta say I felt like Cole's speed was greatly exaggerated in this fight.  He has great mobility - but he doesn't really rely on speed in the games.  Really good fight though.  I didn't realize how much I missed Infamous.  Wish we could get more Cole.
That was sure really something else and I really mean it 🤟🤟🏻🤟🏽
4:12 Evil Boomstick 9:24 Evil Wiz
Ay man, all i gotta say is that sht was hard as fck😭😭😭
Pretty sure dude would just get infected and turned into a zombie.
The dragon ball z abridged reference is insane
Name of song used for this death battle please
Thanks for this. I mean it, I genuinely can't believe i missed this for an entire year, maybe with some hype we could convince somebody to make Cole into a show, because honestly InFamous is genuinely one of coolest things I've ever seen, maybe Transformers was cooler... but let's be honest, cool is always a win 🏆
Now that they've re-done Master Chief vs Doomslayer they should re do this one.
Im sorry but Prototype absolutely deserves a reboot, it was probably the best of the hack n slash genres of the time. GoW, Ninja Gaiden, Prototype and Infamous are all iconic
Um actually, if yall truly played Prototype, you’d know that Alex can’t jump that high when he has his armor ability active 🤓
So happy for this ending, I need to play InFamous again. Such an underrated game and yet soo good. Best thing is you do decide to be good or evil and they only had to use half of Cole’s power for this video lol
SEE PROOF OF THEIR BLATANT FAVORITISM, ALEX MERCER IS A BIOPHAGE, HE CAN HEAL FROM A SINGLE CELL, SO WHEN HE STABBED COLE HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABSORBED, AND EVEN IF HE SOMEHOW DIDNT, ALEX WOULD REGROW FROM THE HUNDREDS OF BLOOD DROPLETS coal beat out of him, and even if we ignore that alex has an extreme advantage, because he has complete control over his cells, where Cole DOESN'T, ALL ALEX WOULD NEED TO DO IS ADAPT HIS CELLS INTO THE SAME KIND AS AN ELECTRIC EEL BUT BETTER, THEN HE COULD JUST ABSORB COLES LIGHTNING CUZ IN THE PROTOTYPE GAMES 1 AND 2 alex constantly has to adapt new abilities, how u ganna tell me he can't adapt to coles ELECTRIC power, BULLSH1T. I'm so disappointed in you DB
Is like Thor vs the Hulk Cole Is thor and A Organic Power can do nothing against Anti matter and Energy or Fire Thor will Kill the hulk 2 with his hammer
The nuke survivor lost? Sure.
Maaaaaaaaan..... i wanna play Infamous for the first time again.
whoever voted for this felon belongs in handcuffs themselves for allowing themselves to be brainwashed by this staterun media without anypushback half of the MAGA supporters i've seen are crazy them selves....
I loved these games back in the day, I wish they would be remade.
These fights feel like a TV show finale. And you don’t know who the hero is until the ending when they win 😂
The ending to this fight is similar to ghost rider vs spawn
Im back a year later. And i still say you got this one wrong. Alex mercer was downplayed too much.
I love this fight, despite wanted Alex to win it's still amazing
I like good guys but at the same time I really want to see the evil variation of him beating him
Thanks To The Efforts Of Cole Macgrath….  Armed With His Bident….   And His Wrath….  Alex Mercer Died Along With His Blood Bath.
Real good one
Well, everything happened like in real life. Prototype died
LETS GOOOO HEROES. WTF IS A LAME SSS BAD CHARACTER?
Crazy how neither of them could possibly beat the president in Saints Row 4
2:05 actually the reason boomstick says this is because n the game cole has a line "ur not a freak u just hav ice shooting out of ur ass"
inHuman is a great Song to play in both inFamous and Prototype's Boss Battles.
I won't lie. This is one of the BEST displays of an even Hero vs. Villain fight in Death Battle history.
Now I want to see Alex Mercer Vs. Ken Kaneki
cole won
Infamous vs ??????    I want more!!!!!!!!!!!
WHO WON ALEX OR COLE?
Infamous was a great game.
20 freaking ads WTF
I will say Cole seems to have more plot armor. Cole was much more likely to get beat by random thugs than Alex.
I had a friend who was completely addicted to both of these franchises
who?
Alex Mercer would dog walk Cole, easily. This death battle was very biased.
Alex mercer should have win if he consumed him if he had a chance
15:49 Yeah Alex could just chopped the Cole's head off and win the fight. Alex can survive and take out the whole US Army and Blackwatch while Cole can be killed by bullets and water.
Man, I LOVED these games!
5:35 Not to mention it's implied he came back after the good ending.
It's funny how Cole can't survive a borage of bullets like mercer can? Jesus mercer has super strength the virus is air born? A tiny speck can even infect everyone Cole a third person shooting game but in the second game the added a melee weapon with the same attack over and over again? Atleast mercer has tendrils? Hammer? Bust Muscle? Claws? Sword? Shield? Body armor? Walkrunner? Sprint faster than cheetah? Hulk jumps? Combat is way off charts? Mercer can destroy building Cole can even survive a collapse building if it fell on him? Comparing there survival mercer has more of that than Cole? Cole meat is still flesh. Humans wear facemask to survive the infection of Manhattan. Dew to the queen virus infection airborne after mercer eat the queen mercer was the most deadliest of the rest. He can do what the queen did to Manhattan way worse than anywon? Mercer is just slow at using his power unlike heller study his new found power and defeated mercer or so the say? But if mercer killed the queen heller could be the new mercer.?
Ghost Rider Vs Spawn really ended the exact way as this, lol
Im on Cole's side its just that dude got stabbed in the gut and yet lived anyway kinda strange since he doesnt have regenerative abilities
2:15 Muffin button
"This world isn't perfect, but it's a hell lot better without you in it" To me gives off the same energy as when Shadow says "There's no place for you in this timeline. Ever!" to Mephiles in Shadow Generations
I thought that after Shadow vs Ryuko with Kill La Kill and Rick vs The Doctor with Doctor Who I'd stop hyperfixating on characters because of Death Battle episodes Oh how wrong I was (Referring to Cole)
The fight between Cole MacGrath and Alex Mercer felt so nostalgic and so awesome at the same time. 😎
You telling me mercer lost bc he didn't pay his lightbill😂😂😂
Not sure how many people noticed this, but when Cole resisted Alex's attempt to consume him, he activated Karmic Overdrive. In the first Infamous game, this ability allows Cole to use any power without cost for a short period of time.
Cole the goat
The age of creativity has died. I've never played either of the games before, but watching gameplays were always entertaining with amazing displays of their abilities. I just feel like developers just decide to leave influential videogames to rot if they are not profitable in any way.
I only just knew about the two games and I thought that Cole McGrath is Alex Mercer
i’d love a follow-up episode where james & delsin fight each other, because despite delsin having more powers than cole, he’s relatively the same strength overall, while james is canonically stronger than alex and, post consuming him, should be capable of everything that alex is as well. feels like it would be a lot more even.
Cole using Ionic Freeze to attack Alex during the scene inside the building could be a reference to its passive ability to not harm civilians, as it is implied there are civilians still inside that Alex has consumed (as evident by the screams inside the building and the post-analysis showing clips of it when talking about Alex absorbing biomass), meaning Cole using it allowed him to hurt Alex without harming anyone else in the crossfire.
Ya know, I'd love to see Nicholas Scryer take a crack at Death Battle
I’ve played both games and saying that cole is the faster one is honestly criminal. Sure Cole’s traversal is a lot faster in the second game but it’s nothing compared to jumping and gliding hundreds of feet in a single bound, or all the combos he does that can only be dodged by someone with the speed and reaction time to move out of attacks in an instant. Coles powers might make him super powerful but he’s still got the relative speed of a regular athlete. Alex wins with the whip blade alone
"Wait. We haven't emptied our trash in 10 years?"
The second I saw the thumbnail I thought to myself "oh man I've played nearly all the way through both series l, Cole MacGrath is going to pull some serious loophole crap in order take down someone like Alex Mercer."
Half as long, twice as bright...
A friend called Prototype “playing Hulk: Ultimate Destruction as Carnage”
The tfs muffin button reference 😂
Personally I think there should be more Alex mercer
Don’t see why Alex couldn’t have removed Coles hand from his face considering this guy can throw tanks like it’s breathing and more than likely has a doomsday grip
Generator Rex is what happens when you play these two games and decide to make a cartoon change my mind
Cole is The Vaccine  Alex is the Virus
I was comparing these 2   Cole Absorb Vechicle s  Vs Alex Absorb Human s Cole Fight nucleair Bosses While Alex Struggle too Survive 1 nucleair Bomb Cole is The Vaccine  Alex is the Virus
YES COLE WON AMAZING
Cole macgrath have to Travel far From New Orleans Too New York City For the battle Against Mercer
I really feel like kessler would win this
I belav in Cole supremse
Silly Westerners... arguing over fictional characters in their playground of a DB comment section instead of looking up to real heroes or developing hypersonic missile technology which renders their armies and navies obsolete.
Hi sorry but does anyone know the name of the background song
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️
dont let those idiots cook ever again
Yeah the fight was cap
Cole doesnt have super skin, how does mercer not just slice him up. Mercer also can regenerate from a single cell, seen after surving a nuke. There is not a world where Cole wins this.
Can we have a fight to see who the real ogre is from Baki and tekken
The writer for prototype 2 "Dan Jolley stated a few months ago that the diagrams for the second game(including the one where Heller splits the moon in two) are literal and therefore Canon.  This means heller and therefore Alex are actually planetary to beyond that in both AP and durability. It also says alot about both their speed, since hellers whipfist had to have been moving at superluminal speed to reach the moon and hit it with that amount of force.  He stated that the devs original plan for prototype 2 was to have Alex evolve to the point of becoming a planet eater during the story.  That part or the story was scrapped obviously, but Alex is still beyplanetary regardless.  Meaning Alex should have hard won this fight with ease. Cole should have lost.
This battle would have been over in about 5 seconds. Alex would have just sliced him in half. consumed him. And then he would gain his powers. Just look at the dynamic gameplay between the both of the games. Alex Mercer moves 20 times faster than Cole ever did. Alex Mercer can one hit m1 Abrams super tanks and destroy them. Call can't do any of those things. All he has is lightning.
I don't understand how Alex lost he could of completely absorb Cole and how did Alex get knocked out of his shell form that easily it would of been easier to make Alex absorbed one of the pilots instead of throwing both at cole  so many loopholes in this fight
DUUUUUUDE Cole had some fire lines in this fight
Fun Fact: Due to his weakness to water, Cole has to take spongebaths to keep up with his hygiene.
I would love to see a crossover game
What’s the song playing?
A year late to put my 2 cents in it but shouldn't it be a draw then if you're using the good's variation and then a win if you're using the evil?
While I agree with everything I still think if Alex slashed him at max strength he’d cut Cole to shreds, the shield is more for projectiles not really physical attacks
Please somebody tell me the name of the song
Had an idea for the longest time for another infamous game leading off after second sons evil ending where you play as someone who has Cole’s electric powers, essentially putting an end to delsins addiction of draining other conduits of their powers. Just a concept
I don't think Cole was meant to be converting matter to energy with his shield - just blocking the matter and absorbing the kinetic - restrictions on the engine presumably.
If the virus took over Cole that’s a discussion we’re not ready for 😅
the bad thing is cole wasnt even at peak power in cannon the whole reason things happened the way they did is because cole has the power of time travel
Wow, this actually really surprised me. All this time I thought Alex Mercer was like one of the most OP video game characters conceived, but Cole is an excellent foil to him, well researched guys. Cheers
Should do asta v kirito
James Heller from Prototype 2 would have won 😤 (definitely not a prototype fan here)
como fanático de las dos franquicias  siendo los mis juegos favoritos, esta es la fantasía mas grande que tenia de niño, ver quien de los dos es mas fuerte y aunque siempre eh sido fan de Alex Mercer siempre apostaba mas por Cole MacGrath y verlo ganar esta lucha de leyendas me dio tanta satisfacción, como si de verdad hubiera apostado dinero por el.
Fantastic. Okay now do James Heller vs Delson Rowe
The crossover game was scrapped due to concord, remember that, damn you sony!
I came back to this fight hard asf
I was rooting for Cole because Alex was killed like a b**ch by Heller.  If Prototype 2 hadn’t changed Protagonists I would probably root for Alex.
you guys forgot one...very...specific power. Biobomb the moment cole was impaled he lost. no if ands or buts, he exploded instantly
waos ya veo el por que critican tanto estas batallas de este canal
Thought this was star killer vs star killer for a second
This is entirely compium. Mercer/Black Light is practically god mode levels of power and the fight wouldn’t even be close.
Prototype is a better game and is more fun.  Also, Alex would win.
Weird that it took so long to do this one haha, good to see it still
PlayStation Crossover
Idk man, Alex didnt use his most devastaring devastator, the ground spike one lol   But while I love both heroes. Saying Xole wins because he withstood the raysphere is silly. Yes, it makes Cole have better endurance than Mercer, but to say he is a walking nuke is a strech.
You know, it really feels these 2 characters were meant to fight all along.  Many of cole's powers are practically designed to counter Mercer🤷🏽‍♂️
One can shake off multiple tank shells. The other dies in water or from 3 shots of a rifle
yea im not gonna lie when i saw the fight i was lowkey mad at the outcome and even more so at you guys for having the audacity but honestly yall explained it will. cole was just on a diff level of the same kinda badassery
Am I the only one who wants a remake and reboot of both Infamous and Prototype?
Personalny i thing Mercer could just consume Coal coz no supreme gen that is blocking the consumption also you did not consider Alexe's speed and all his abilities. So in my opinion Alex is just more powerfull also all the mas that he comsumes he gets witch makes him more powerfull (lore) IT also depends when they are fighting bc mid prototype Alex is just dying against Coal but after prototype 2 Alex wins (dont be mad this is just an opinion)
If there’s even a single scrap of blacklight virus left, Alex is still around.
Alex Mercer is cooler, and anyone who disagrees should either ingest nuclear fuel, or keep it to themselve.
Prototype stomps mid dif
Both amazing characters that unfortunately met their ends in the sequels
Alex Mercer should be a guest character in a Mortal Kombat game.
Mercer would fight to consume so at the moment cole got close enough it would’ve been over
I grew up playing infamous and I am extremely happy Cole won
I summon you, (skeety7883) Skeety!
Delsin rowe vs Alex mercer
Better late than never!
Mercer can hurl 60 ton tanks hundreds of feet with one arm effortlessly, he's vastly stronger, faster and more durable. I vastly prefer infamous but cole is just not winning.
This battle puts a smile on my face.
This is such bull lol. There's nothing in the Infamous lore to suggest Cole even has super strength. Sure, he has enhanced endurance, but he's not even close to invulnerable - even regular plain bullets can hurt him. Realistically, if Mercer kept his distance even a little bit and prevented Cole from bio-leeching off him, and used his armor in conjunction with the tendrils, he'd be able to cut his ass to pieces in minutes, if even that
With great power comes great Responsibility   I see why this debate exists now
The main issue with Alex - he's all organic. And too metal. That's why Cole basically fries him up.
Idk why because they explain everything but I just don’t agree with the results Alex is crazy overpowered and in theory can make clones just as strong as him. But I respect the video and the facts, good research.
Honestly, Alex Mercer vs Carnage and  Cole McGrath vs Zeus would have been better matchups
Sony recently announced they intend to shift gears back into single-player titles, fingers crossed both of these titles get revived.
something that I didnt notice is that Alex was going to consume Cole, this means he weakened him enough to get to that point. I aint saying Alex should have won but I think thats a detail that got left out. I love Prototype and Infamous, I pray for a remaster for both of them.
dang I miss the Prototype franchise so much. in general, [PROTOTYPE] and inFamous would be such a sick crossover - too bad both franchises just kinda vanished in that golden age of Videogames were 'fun' was actually still a priority
I’m calling bs, I see why I stopped watching yall. Yall really don’t have clue what yall are talking about
Bro Alex wins cuh
Respectfully both of them need a sequel and/or reboot
Sounds like cotton candy Randy haha
So hype as an infamous fan rn
this is like electro vs venom
Eh if I’m not wrong the cannon ending is the “bad” ending where you side with the Beast, since in Infamous second son conduits still exist and are well alive
TEAM COLE!!!!🎉🎉
Cole is not as fast or strong as alex,and the shock wave Alex produce when fighting should tell you just how strong alex is
the most plot armour fight ive seen in a while
Hear me out …. Alex vs prime time Wolverine would be epic
Alex wouldve dominated cole realistically.
Someone needs to remake prototype 1 and infamous 1 for PS5 those were amazing games from a better time. When game companies knew their audiences. I miss these old games i remember spending 30 minutes to just stealth absorb a whole base in prototype for fun or performing every stunt in infamous.
We been over this 12 years ago cole would clap Alex any day of the week
ᕙ⁠(⁠ ͡⁠◉⁠ ͜⁠ ⁠ʖ⁠ ͡⁠◉⁠)⁠ᕗ
From the thumb nail it looked like Shepard vs assassins Creed
Alex Mercer can also shapeshift. He'd use that
Anyone know the music that was playing the background during the fight scene between cole and alex?
Would love to see evil Cole fight someone
good ass fight
I would like to see a remaster or remake of the two games
😡
Prototype is the closest we're ever going to get to a venom game
10 years in the making, and it was well worth the wait.   Me being a fan of Infamous, and never played the Prototype games, I was rooting for Cole to take the W, but after looking at Alex’s rep sheet, I was certain that there was no way Cole was winning. But I’m glad I was wrong in the end.   Shame that nowadays both franchises have been dormant for years now; they both deserve a revival or collection for the current consoles.
Has anyone noticed that insomniac characters consistently beat naughty dog characters?
Another reason why I love superheroes
What's the name of this music that's playing
one problem with their decision of which cole to go with is that the canonical cole IS the evil one, thats why the sequels happen at all
I know Mercer would be absoutely washed, but I would love to see how an (arguably) heroic post first game but pre second game Mercer would interact with an Evil Cole.
Que mentira da porra!
The other was a prototype, but the one is the official infamous 🔥💯
Now this episode is technically-somewhat...  Shadow the Hedgehog VS Shadow the Hedgehog  Play Shadow Generations, Prototype, Infamous, and watch Venom.
Anyone know the song used in the fight?
Alex Mercer Vs Dimitri (Prototype Vs Fire Emblem) DEATH BATTLE
I’m only commenting now because I’m catching up on Death Battle, but this is one of the best superhero vs supervillain fights I’ve ever seen 15:28
Imagine a prototype 3 where Alex rips through Hellers chest open , alien style
What's the song?
It is now my official headcanon these universes are one of the same, I'm not Cole Macgrath is supreme
Back in the day, people argued which was better.  But after playing both games, in high school I wanted one thing - a crossover game where these 2 teamed up.  Or fought.  Never gonna happen, but this at least let me see a little of what I had in mind back then.  Both excellent games.  I think Infamous 1 deserves at least a remaster, really I think it deserves a remake/rebooot.
Muffin button What? Wiz: what?
Honestly thought yall where gonna give it to Alex because you didn’t use Cole’s better power set from the evil karma ending
E=mc2 has been debunked
This was actually a really good deathbattle
"You either die a hero" vs "Live long enough to se yourself become the villain"
"The only vermin I see here... is *you."*  Yeah I knew Cole was gonna win after that.
Ok
damn no dlc powers for cole macgrath
I don't even care about the stats or the characters as I am unfamiliar with their frachises but this death battle hits different
Venom vs prototype
one thing to know about the second game from the first one Alex died and brought back to life from the Blacklight Virus and since Alex is no more the Blacklight Virus took Alex’s body and he controls all the mind I think there could likely be a round 2 for this soon since Blacklight Virus can spread through anything
Sony instead of messing around with unneeded remasters like Horizon Zero/TLoU, they should be remastering/remaking Infamous. They could make surveys to judge engagement, but it is beyond Sony to feedback.
The sequel James vs Delson 🤔
This episode reminded me of prototype and how much i loved it as a kid
“You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.” -Harvey Dent The Dark Knight (2008)  This quote actually fits the matchup perfectly with these characters.
Alex mercer is an evil, human version of Kirby.
You know what's funny about Alex Mercer? At least in the first game, before that character assassination in the second, becoming a walking talking viral mass actually made him a better person. Original Alex was a dangerous sociopath who was never socialized properly that willingly committed an act of bioterrorism as petty revenge on humanity for being killed, Virus Alex absorbed enough other people to develop a sense of empathy actually caring about others.
starkiller vs anyone please!
Don’t
Alex mercer vs Nero
Coles strongest power is plotarmor. Alex had so many more killshots and opportunities to dismember and rip him in half, the only thing saving cole was the script
Aint no way Cole is tanking Mercers sheer brute strength. Aint no way.
I just learned that Infamous released a legit day before my birthday. Cool.
This is so good one of the best of DB ive seen
Alex is powerful than cole. Alex's power is more powerful than just a power like electricity.
So Cole can resist mind powers, but we're not gonna talk about the Hivemind ? Cole's more powerful, makes sense, but Alex has resistances. And how many times can Cole be stabbed by 1,000 tendrils before he faces Death?
Flxtia..
ваши батлы бред собачий !!!!!
I feel bad that Alex lost, well it is what it is, a very nice match...much better than prototype 2 had to offer, thanks
i have a question. would alex mercer gain Coles powers if he absorbed him?
so basically a guy from a Teen rated video game beat a guy from a Mature rated video game.
Alex woudve won in real life
Have to admit, when this was announced I thought it would be a case of close range vs long range. With Cole having more options from a distance while Alex could smash him if he got close enough. Was very surprised to see that Cole had him beat in so many stuff.
What was 1:43 is that drake?
Anyone here after the supposed Kotaku article about 2016 leaks hinting at those two games not getting a crossover due to Concord?
Alex wins so easy!
9:31😂
Guys if batman can beat superman then why Alex mercer can defeat cole mcgarth. He could make himself immune to cole's bio electricity absorbption or could simply mutate himself as he likes. But I think the first one would work. Also, in Marvel's Ultimate spiderman, he defeated electro in a form which was pure energy who is far superior to Cole's monster form and yet spiderman beat electro with his mind. So Alex can become stronger than Cole and mush his face to ground. Alex is far superior than him because of all people he consumed which are scientists, commandos and anyone you could imagine.
Honestly Alex is lucky he faced Good Cole instead of Evil Cole
They need to remaster or make sequels to these games!
Apparently, there was supposed to be a canon crossover.
Since you made this, how about an almost similar match next time , like Delsin rowe vs cal kestis😮😁🫡
Damn, it's been a year already since this dropped
Raiden (Mortal Kombat) vs Cole McGrath.
13:30
we couldve had this instead of concord btw
Hate Boomstick so much, ruins this great show for me lol
I still convinced mercer is stronger
I love death battle you guys are amazing 😂😂😂😂 4:27
Dude who ever picks your music for these fights needs an effing raise man…perfection !!! Makes the fight million times better
Yeah we ain’t cooking with this one.     What have you done?!
Who Wins? Both Franchises, it's dead jim
well now that carnage vs alex mercer isn't a thing anymore what about toxin vs james heller
There's no way Mercer lost this, I call shenanigans
I’m kind of sad that Alex didn’t win. it takes me back to my teenage days playing prototype. It was so much fun. It’s one of the few games that you can just replay over and over and enjoy.
I know nothing about either of these games, but based on Cole's design, powers, and morality, I wanna see him fight Starkiller from Star Wars The Force Unleashed.
What song is that
I love Cole. I was so upset he had to die... they needed more endings for each karma path.  I feel like they could do some awesome remarks.
Nice
Yay! Cole won!  The inFAMOUS franchise was LITERALLY my childhood! And seeing Cole win made me really emotional! Like, my childhood came back to me.  Imma buy a PS3 now, and I will play the heck out of inFAMOUS 1 and 2.  I also love the character of Mercer too, but, good always prevails over evil, no matter how devastating it is.  If Evil Cole and Good Cole were going head to toe against each other, I am sure Good Cole would still prevail, as Good Cole has a will like Green Lantern.  Thank you, for reminding how good my childhood was, guys, and I wish that these two awesome franchises were rebooted in the future, to be better than ever.
Cole MacGrath vs. Alex Mercer (Sony's InFamous vs. Microsoft Windows and Activision Blizzard's Prototype)
Really wanted alex to win since he was one of the first games I played in my childhood, but this cole guy just seems way too op. fair judgement, good video
Goddamn both of these franchises need a new game. Both of their powers are way too fun and the games kick too much ass for them to be this dormant.
The fight starts here: 12:57
“Read your mind like Goku’s Muffin Button” was a reference I did NOT expect in this.
Do rabbids vs. minions
Now I'm imagining Delsin Rowe vs James Heller
Alex mercer should win because he is more powerful
They should do informus 2 and prototype 2 characters next that would be sick 💪🏼
Sequel to Prototype idea, after the events of 2.  An open world style city with a new version of the Blacklight Virus, you play as a new character you design (gender and appearance) as the new Prototype and you are to kill James Heller, but you can chose weither you do or not.
More powerful maybe but durability is way different  bullets can kill cole in a few hits two punches from alex and its over
Bad take lol this is crazy even looking at the facts in no way would Cole be able kill Alex we seen him come back from a nuke lmao literally this is crazy ngl
Alex mercer was dumb ass for literally taking electric man to electric factory and literally not killing in one shot
Fine I'll go play Infamous! Note: It's awesomesauce!
Death Battle: Jokes about Cole being similar to Shadow.  SEGA: Turns Shadow into Alex Mercer.
This one fight has better story telling than the entirety of she-hulk.
Boomstick’s ex wives have their lore too 😂
Should’ve did Cole vs delsin
Yeah cap buddy, Alex mercer is a literaly virus lol he is not a human being to be killed, he can be consumed and passed on maybe but not die. Alex can use the smalles bit of himself to regenerate his whole body.
I use the skip the explanation straight to the fight as a kid now the intros are the best part for me
What's this song called 0:47
Little mistake you made about the supreme hunter in the start.. It CANNOT survive a nuke of that magnitude   "Once the bomb goes off, they wont be looking for me, and when i consume you, ill be able to withstand, even this."  Its survival was contingent on defeating and consuming alex mercer. As for alex, his power is broken, his healing factor most of all. In the second game, he turned the blacklight, his own viral makeup into an aerosolized mist.. This means that with a sufficient imagination, he could just leave pieces of his viral DNA behind and reconstitute himself.
Prototype & The Infamous series deserve more sequels
Prototype 2 vs infamous 2
Okay I love this battle
Cole absorbed no electricity during the fight. And while he had a healing factor he was also pretty squishy. Idk about the outcome lolol
This fight would always come down to who could absorb who first.
I'll be honest, this one was a surprise to me.
Cole McGrath S+++ Tier Conduit!
Este versus tiene mas huecos que Sasha Grey lul Cole no podria matar a Mercer ...La unica manera de acabar con un prototypo seria por consumo o destruir todo rastro del virus blacklight dado que aparentemente estos poseen un hack que niega la regeneracion y esto es muy complicado ya que la biomasa que absorven por norma al no aumentar su tamaño corporal aumentan su densidad; sino verse como los soldados de la blackwatch necesitaban de un tanque termobarico para abrir una grieta en la colmena principal. De hecho la densidad de Mercer debe ser como minimo 3 a 4 veces la del OSMIO  ; Al final del primero apesar de venir nerfesdo debido a enfrentarse al cazador supremo tolero la bomba nuclear a escala real ( temperatura/ Onda expansiva). Y esto lo hizo  " nerfeado " tras haber acabado con la personificacion de la cura que era el propio cazador supremo el cual en el primer enfrentamiento contra mi chico tras haber sido reducido a un charco de sangre fue capaz de asesinar y consumir al Especialista que era un tipo muy duro .... Y todo esto solo en el  primer juego donde para el segundo las cosas escalan a mas ... Se dejan varias cosas de lado la verdad y ni hablar que Mercer al mero contacto debio consumir a Cole ya que hablamos de un  super virus quimerico infeccioso que  asimila personas en segundos ( cartilago y huesos ) e incluso capaz de absorver ropa y metales ligeros como cascos, cuchillos etc etc esto da mas analizis sin mencionar las tramas que dan aun mas tela que cortar Y para  el segundo juego  ya ni hablemos donde la escala es absurda escalando del Kratos negro ( Heller) a la mitad de su juego... En fin gano el mas popular . supongo.🤣😅😅😅
delsi from infamous second son or james heler from prototype who would win
This is why i dint believe cole is dead at the end of the second game because of the electro magnetism
Мне кажется в самом первом моменте, где алекс схватил этого чувака, он мог просто сразу же его поглотить.
Alternative title “Tennage Carnage vs Angsty Aang”
Nah I have too say ur wrong
7:35 oh no😭
4:16 never thought i’d see this? multiverse much?
Converting matter to energy: * is an impossibility * Wiz: I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that
So like, have we proven that Cole can get major organs fully penetrated and be good? Because I recall getting hit by 2 shotgun shots and instantly dying 500 times. I wanna be team coal but realistically Alex could just toss him in water or cut his arms off
Still waiting for a Death Battle with Commander Shepard from Mass Effect🤞🏻🤞🏻
Cole KILLED him wow
Infamous is top 5 for me love those games
James Heller at the end of P2 sweeps.
Yeahhhh maybe Alex Is weak at the end of the prototype franchise but if he could absorb enough people(mass) he can become stronger (it was also stated in prototype 2 that more people/infected(mass) U absorb the stronger U are and we know that Alex or james heller havent absorbed a lot of them throughout the games
Alex: If you won’t give me your power, I’ll take it instead  Cole: good idea  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
This is perhaps the best advertisement for both series I've ever seen lol
LOL every death battle is absolute bs. Alex survived a nuke, no way he’s going down easy  The second Alex punched Cole with his mutated fists, Cole literally should have exploded from impact
I call that plot armor
According to the game mechanics....Alex is physically as strong as The Hulk as the ganeplay is same for jumping mechanics,throwing mechanics and knocking all forms of vehicles out of the way just by running into them also with his healing factor and many many weapons as well as ultimate moves aka Finishers...and an Armored Suit Ult Form as well as a Shield Abikity that absorbs a portion of damage then breaks and has to recharge Alex Mercer is easily one of the most deadly Video Game Characters ever right up there with Dante and Doom Guy.
Dude...no this is so uneven and unfair af!...Alex Mercer is basically Carnage Symbiote and he can litterally do way too much!
I like infamous and all, but dear god is the cole d riding is too much. People unironically think he's nuke level?
I played both games but I don't think Cole can win against alex bcs alex is invincible he is not human he is a biomass
Cole MacGrath is a legend
im predicting cole winning this cause alex is pretty weak against lightning as seen in mercer vs cpt cross
When did someone say awesome sauce?
So, we could have had King Ghidorah vs Deathwing, but we got these two nothing characters fighting instead? We could have had an epic dragon fight, but no, we needed this over the world destroying dragons.
This is actually like Static Shock vs Black Hat if you think about it.
These animators deserve a raise and a can of beans
Last words while being bioleached   Alex" hmm so this how it feels to be eaten alive "
I rock with both of these characters but I would have been distraught of Cole lost
I'm 100% positive that Alex would have won if it weren't for the fact that he wanted to make the world a better place. Just like good Cole did.
Man the early 2000's  action media was cringe edgy
Out of curiosity .How many people who think wrote fanfic's about these guys fighting Batman or Spider-Man?
Would have loved for a doom demon invasion to happen and both of these guys have to take on what the slayer had to. I can see cole getting amped by the argent energy and Alex Mercer getting amped through demonic biomass.
This is bs lmao Alex claps Cole & Delsin at the same time 😂😂 not even close
Alax Mercer VS Ken Kaneki?
Best fight of 2023🔥🔥🔥
this is the one death battle where i honestly wasn't sure who i wanted to win or who would win
To be honest I wanna see the guy from one piece with the  poison poison or venom venom fruit Fight someone with similar buildings to his
Make part 2 with the vampire infamous
If I recall from Prototype, isn't Mercer vulnerable to electricity?
Shoot Ice spikes sounded like shoot Ice spice 😅
I mean, Alex mercer biggest boss was a biological weapon, Cole Biggest boss was literally the devil, satan himself
Are 2 sponsors in 1 video legal?
So Alex Mercer started out at a Shadow the Hedgehog level of edge, and then eventually ended up in Albert Wesker territory.
Should have been Alex Mercer vs Albert Wesker
Infamous dub
Both of cole and alex was both of badasses heroes both of them want to save the world from destruction everyone else has a supernatural powers the question is who's going to win in death battle my money on cole everyone has a superpowers unleashed your powers and superpowers.
When alex was consuming cole i thought that was it until cole uno reversed his ass
I was really scared Cole would lose to Alex because of Alex’s healing abilities.
Yo, a point blank nuke couldn't kill Blacklight. Is this guy more powerful than a modern nuke?
Wait… does Cole have the same powers as Magneto, just broader? Because if so, he’s ridiculously powerful.
This is unironically my favorite death battle.
If i had a super power it'd be cole's, cooler and better than Alex's
Venom at home vs starkillers at home
Alex's scream at 16:01 was powerful and awesome. Top tier.
Cole: I’m Pure Energy  Mercer: I’m Pure Bio Terror  2024 Shadow: I’m both…
12:59
I feel like if there was a prototype 3, it could've been the series finale and have the main character have themselves get killed after killing the main antagonist (hopefully not Heller.) and so they could end the Mercer virus for good.
I STILL NEED A REMAKE OF THE FIRST TWO INFAMOUS!!! or at least a PC port.
Alex just got more powers
I love both franchises and I actually prefer Cole over Alex, but... I don't think he will have enough time to kill Alex. Even though Cole's destruction power is superior to Alex. I believe Alex is faster, I know he's physically stronger, and he's Way more resistant. If he manages to pierce through Cole's whole body with his sword as in the video, he might be dead almost immediately, even if he survived, he needs electricity to regenerate, and I don't think Alex will simply wait. With the electro absorb thingie, it isn't precisely instantaneous. The victim needs to be immovilized, or surprised, or forced, which well, would be pretty hard to do on Alex. Either way, I believe that the more the battle continues, Cole will have more probabilities to manage his powers to win, but the problem is... Alex prolly could beat him before Cole can unleash enough power to banish Alex
Cool fight, not a fan of the music option Edit: I Gave the music another listen … it’s really good when you replay a few times
"Well Cole, welcome to the top of the food chain"
I haven’t watched one of these in a while but hell yea I was happy for the ending
Kessler said he traveled back in time to make the future a better place, but in my opinion that’s a big load of crap. If he really wanted to stop the Beast than he would’ve destroyed the First Sons the moment he arrived in the past; but instead, he seized control of the First Sons and chose to orchestrate everything. The creation of the Ray Sphere, Cole’s powers, Trish’s death, and the creation of the Beast. He could’ve stopped all of this, but he couldn’t live with his failures and chose to take it out on himself in the past. Just felt like I had to say it.
Can you guys do borderlands characters
Delsin rowe vs Alex mercer Or  Delsin rowe vs James heller Who wins
Alex is on a totally different level.  Cole is spiritual.  Alex is physical.     Killing as Alex seem totally natural.  Guilt when Cole.  Cole needed to just chill out.  Alex had a biblical mission to contend with.  Now I have to replay both.  Tomorrow!
PS3 > 360
Clone had an infinite battery Alex didn’t that’s all that needs to be said
12:57 12:58 12:59
looking back at this video we need a death battle between nelson (second son guy) vs the mc in prototype 2
Alex Mercers vs Venom
Alex forever ❤❤
Now we gotta see the guy from Second son get a death battle
But what would happen if alex mercer was able to get and absorbed a drop of cole's blood. Ifell like this would h ave been a different  story😅
That would be cool to have a InFamous and prototype crossover game you can switch between characters
Alex vs senator armstrong woulda been good too.
Alex mercer would be an incredible marvel symbiote character lol
Any named Gold from the red Rising Series by Pierce Brown and any space marine from WH40k would be a hell of a fight
Alex is a Kano main
13:00
Is Alex owned by xbox or PlayStation
u forgot vampire cole
How did he die
Only right you do the recent infamous protagonist vs the prototype 2 protagonist
16:00-16:15 Was that a bio leech Thunder drop combo move what it was it obliterated Alex!
Nah Alex would win
Missed the best line to say at the end. "Welcome to the top of the food chain!"
I wish there was a rewind button for evil Cole
Delsin Rowe vs James Heller
The result is wrong, Alex would beat Cole without many difficulties because he has much more done than himself.
I find it weird that throughout the fight Alex Mercer looked stronger between the two and yet in the breakdown they were highlighting how much gap in power there is between the two. Cool fight tho
The fact that you let Alex lose makes me hate you
Cold is mad cold giving me nostalgia when I was a kid
You should do delsin vs the prototype 2 man
Have Vader win ass shits
The ending seems a bit to mid to me, Alex survived a nuke and regenerated out of some fleshy paste so this shouldnt have been the end in my opinion........ Yes i love the prototype game and i would give Alex the win here 😂
Honestly, alex was strong, but Cole shared powers with quo, and that's why he has icicles and powers. Alex discovered a parasite that he overcame, so he used that for evil instead of good (i think)
Alex should have won
You guys are infamous for having favorites.
Top animation, slightly makes my TOP-5 man. I underestimated Cole a little bit, didn't expect him to have immune vs Alex' virus. They're very even to ech another, such a nice battle!
Damn, this was the true Civil War back then in 2009
Itachi should be in one of these
this was the hypest episode ever of all time
This makes me want to play infamous 2 again
Cole macgrath vs Livewire anybody?  Or maybe evil Delsin Rowe vs Good Cole Macgrath?  Good Delsin Rowe vs Evil Delsin Rowe?  Livewire vs Electro?
A master of flesh vs a master of energy.
Yeah, let’s be real, Alex literally can’t do anything to even remotely stand a chance.  Cole stomps royally, it’s a wonder people think it can go any other way.
Let's debunk this matchup since the Alex lowballing is ludicrous.  **COLE STATS**  2:21  Anyone claiming this can't read. Cole's shield doesn't convert matter into energy; it merely blocks projectiles and converts kinetic energy from impacts into fuel for Cole's power. There's no evidence it turns bullets and such into energy. The game description for Cole's shield, also known as the Forstar ability, states, 'An ice-powered shield that stops enemy bullets cold, converting their energy into fuel for Cole's power.' There's a reason why cars can go through Cole's shield. Furthermore, the guidebook confirms this, so the notion that Cole turns matter into energy is debunked.  2:58  They claim Cole's lightning output is 7.3 megatons, which is inaccurate, and I'll explain why. The game itself debunks that argument. John White, the Beast's main feat, is tanking RPGs, but that's it. But why does this point matter? The problem with the Beast is proving he has any worthwhile durability feats because INFAMOUS doesn’t follow the standard AB formula like AP = durability, like most verses. It shows characters can be stronger than what they can tank, and vice versa, as Cole has higher durability than AP.  The Beast was completely destroyed by a 51-kiloton nuke, to the point where he had to regenerate from a single ball of energy, which is town-level in comparison to a mountain-level feat he performs at the start of the game. Also, because we can’t prove how durable the Beast is, the best we can say is below town level. The fact, just off canon numbers we get from the guidebook for 2 for how much power is output from Ionic Storm (1000s of gigawatts), also gets to town level. The fact that the Beast’s body can’t even really tank hits from this move shows as such, their AP doesn’t equal durability.  If we apply Db logic, then the Beast should have been taken down in a single shot from Cole's lightning, but he wasn't.  3:43  This isn't true because INFAMOUS works on a multiverse, and there are infinite universes according to the guidebook. He doesn’t have the same feats, and because INFAMOUS works on a multiverse, you have to prove that Cole has the same level of power as he does in Kessler’s timeline. Otherwise, you’re using an association fallacy. We see from Kessler himself that he is taller and has a completely different power set to Cole, as he isn’t stated to use electricity, just energy in Prima's guidebook. With these differences, showing Cole from different timelines can be completely different both physically and ability-wise; you absolutely have to prove Cole's power is as Kessler’s. Otherwise, again, it's an association fallacy.  3:58  Kessler wanted Cole to be strong enough to fight the Beast and make tough choices.  4:41  This has never been shown. In fact, the guidebook never states it, and all we could find regarding that information is from a non-canon game.  Electricity doesn't move at 90 percent the speed of light; that is a highball, and there are numerous sources that state electricity moves at 1/3.  4:46  Severely injuring the Beast is not as impressive as they think, as his durability doesn’t scale to his AP. He couldn’t withstand a 51 Kiloton nuke; it reduced him to a ball of energy where he needed to reform. The Beast has below town level durability (I go over this point above).  4:54  No, it didn't. Empire City is still standing after the blast. The blast is a different kind of explosion. Moreover, the Beast actually gets destroyed by his own Ray Sphere explosion, as shown in Infamous Second Son. There is a reason why the Beast had to travel town by town instead of yeeting it at once.  5:01  Cole didn't defeat the Beast; the RFI did.  **ALEX STATS**  7:00  Alex is 29 years old, not 30 years old.  8:07  The nanosecond claim is foolish since there's a much better feat. This calculation (thanks to Balrog Blaze) is based on Greene having billions of years of knowledge thanks to the scan in the Prima guide showing Blacklight was around since the dawn of life on Earth, fueling evolution, and as Alex consumed her, gaining all her knowledge (and he too would get this reaction time).  Greene's knowledge calc  1 second/(86400 seconds * 365 days * 3700000000 Years) = 0.000000000000000008154 seconds  Low end: 1ft/0.000000000000000008154 seconds = 37,363,596,181,800 m/s.  37,363,596,181,800 m/s to Light Speed = 124,631.54 Light Speed  124,631.54 x 2 as James could fight Alex = 249,263.08 Lightspeed  High End: 1m/0.000000000000000008154 seconds = 122,593,493,586,210 m/s  122,593,493,586,210 m/s to light speed = 408,927.87 Light Speed  408,927.87 x 2 = 817,855.74 Lightspeed.  8:45  That is a gameplay mechanic; realistically, Alex should be able to infinitely spam his devastator given the fact that they actually return to Alex's body. There is a reason why Alex on adrenaline surge doesn't lose his health bar when doing a devastator attack.  8:54  This might sound like a nitpick, but he isn't seen as the world's number one terrorist but America's number one terrorist.  10:36  This is again not the best feat Alex has shown. Alex is FTL as shown by his ability to dodge Elizabeth Greene's energy balls and the infected wave of energy; energy travels at light speed. In fact, his perception slows down, allowing him to outpace the wave, showing that he is light speed.  10:46  That's not true at all because 450 kilotons of TNT doesn't even cover half of Manhattan. Captain Cross had said that the whole of Manhattan would be glass, which would require megatons of TNT. There is a site that explains how 8 megatons are needed to nuke Manhattan. So 8 megatons.  11:01  His healing occurs at the molecular level, not cellular. The guidebook states it well, as well as in P2 where Dr. Harry states he would be able to control at the molecular level. I have no idea where they got the information from.  **RESULTS**  16:39  No he wouldn’t, that's a gameplay mechanic same like where Cole has to do an animation to drain bioelectricity from a living organism. We have seen Alex consume a janitor in a single touch by turning him into biomass in the comics, Alex has also consumed 8 evovleds at the same time. So he would just insta-consume Cole.  16:44  The whole reason other people got atomized was because they weren't a conduit. The Ray Sphere was made to turn conduits into super entities, and the radiation it emits is electricity-based and is tailored to conduits. Cole taking the blast in the face doesn't change the fact that the sphere is designed to give a specific type of radiation that conduits, including Cole, are tuned to. This radiation is electricity-based, and electricity is Cole's source of power. Everything about the Ray Sphere was made to ensure it didn't kill Cole. Kessler himself is confident that Cole would survive the blast, that's the reason he went to Cole's body to check his vitals after the explosion.  The Beast's attacks are also radiation-based, particularly those city-wide explosions. The thing here is similar to the Ray Sphere conduits, including Cole, are specifically tuned to the Beast's attacks because they're powered by a particular type of radiation that conduits can absorb. It's not about killing them; it's about granting superpowers.  The Ray Sphere blast isn’t a feat when it’s explicitly shown Conduits are immune to ray field radiation (Nix, Bertrand, plague ward conduit and multiple dead drops in 1 prove this). The Ray Sphere was also tested on animals such as rats, chimpanzees that possessed the conduit gene. As a result, it granted the rat superpowers such as the ability to fly.  If you argue that Cole survived the blast, consider Zeke activating the Ray Sphere on Alden's tower, exposing himself to a miniature blast without visible repercussions.  The reason John was torn apart was that he was the Beast and didn't know his atomic power manipulation; we actually see Cole break the Ray Sphere that malfunctions and creates a vortex that sucks John inside it.  Their argument also doesn't change the fact Cole wouldn't survive Medusa's Wrath which is a death manipulation tool that Alex possesses.  16:54  No, conduits, have shown to be affected by drugs which are designed to attack the body on a molecular level. There is a reason why Abigail, after being affected by drugs, called it heaven. Moreover, Blacklight has shown to infect whitelight which was literally a cure for Blacklight.  16:58  Alex can get biomass in two ways: via every bio-organic thing around him, which would include plants and food scraps if need be, and via a tweet from Dennis Wetwiller (who practically worked on all aspects of the story and design) that says “Haha. I would assume the virus can assimilate ANYTHING including metal (hammerfist time). I would guess it excretes stuff as well, from time to time.” So Alex isn’t limited by bio-organic material but anything, so he has vastly more options than Cole, especially when the world itself is your food. You have to prove Alex wouldn’t just shrug off the electricity, and Cole can survive being infected just by being touched and have his “atomic resistance” ripped apart at the molecular by someone vastly stronger than he.
Peak
Whaut Cole hi lost
Simultaneously dark and hilarious.  Highlights of 2009.  More at 11.
Now that that’s done with, let’s do Alex Mercer vs Rex Salazar next.
Alex Mercer VS Alucard
Anyone here in 2024
One day I’ll see the side I root for win…but today wasn’t that day.   RIP prototype, you were a game for the ages
Man Alex just can't catch a W
7:33  LP was my childhood
Cool is powerful
I grew up on 360 always loved prototype years later was able to emulate infamous and all I can say is I’m deeply disappointed both of these games lost support they are both great games that are only divided because the console wall
I wish these universes were sharing the same universe
I got scared that cole would lose
Incidentally, I've seen the boss rushes for both.
I keep watching this on repeat every day, I grew up with the ps3 and infamous, it always gets me hyped up!!!
When did they say "awesomesauce"
They kept saying that the script was supposed to be a (parody of a) 2013 script full of lame meme humor, but it didn't feel too different from a script written in this era. I'd think that a parody of a dated script would involve stuff like Wiz and Boomstick trying to dance around offensive jokes or an overdose of references to stuff that people only talked about in the early 2010s, because even the "dated" references in this episode felt pretty evergreen. This is hardly the only time they ever did a Death Battle between characters that ceased to be especially popular by the time it came out, and they didn't try to make jokes they thought could pass for jokes from the era the properties were initially popular in those, so I think that they should've just written it like a normal Death Battle script.
13:55 was that a Minecraft dirt block sound
Next they should do cole vs delsin
yo ive always wanted to watch this lesss goooo. after 6 months dam
I just finished InFamous 2 and I agree, he's singnificantly stronger than VirusBoi
Would love to see Cole McGrath vs delson rowe
Death Battle is so unbelievable with how they pick losers and winners. Alex Mercer should have won that fight. They just like to make weak characters look good to not piss off people that play that specific game. Alex Mercer literally could have ate him and it would have been done. Death Battle is trash.
RIP to the dozen poor office workers blown up
There are so many ways alex can beat cole in a fight, and that last line cole had was just insulting. I cant stand you fools sometimes.
Prototype would’ve won. Cole can’t even come close to Alex’s power.
What's that song called playing in the background
16:09
So the logical conclusion would be James Heller vs Delsin Row Be pretty fun to see that fight in like 10 years
Ah yes electro vs carnage
So what was this episode's theme, then?
when do we get Mahito vs Alex Mercer
"Either you die a hero" (Cole) "Or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain" (Alex)
If I remember correctly Alex was a hero trying to STOP black watch and the New York zero infection, who was for some reason turned villain. I get they based him offa the second game to help drive a story. But the prototype one Alex would probably try to dissuade the fight and would see it as an no other choice option ,in my personal  PT 1 Alex opinion is stronger then PT 2 Alex. He could summon infected, have a MASSIVE tendril burst that covered a large area, the ground spikes, his ultimates alone could clear hundreds of infected. And in two they did him dirty.
Sorry, other guy lost the moment he got hit with the first strike. Insta infect. Over.
Luigi vs Pac-Man  And please let Luigi win this time
Well this seemed biased
Man do i disagree, but still fun to watch.
Battle starts at 12:56
Bro the guy that died should have won my guy had him 3 times to kill him but waited like 5 seconds dude yall picking favorites fr
Now this is a battle I wanted to see 🤩🙏
GET ZAPPED!⚡️ 15:58
A completely total Hero VS Villain Death Battle! 🤩🤩🤩
15:49 why does this look like a good wallpaper for a pc for me
Insane that I just found this after being the biggest fan of these games ever
This could’ve went anyway, but it’s a crime that both of these franchises are still not around. I’d love to see them come back.
We really need a remake of these two games. I loved them both so much.
First Alex Mercer vs "Hero Karma" Cole MacGrath... there will be the second part of James Heller vs "Evil Karma" Cole MacGrath?
*Prediction before watching:* Cole's gonna win because while Mercer controls cells, he controls electromagnetism, a much more elemental force. Sure, Alex's regeneration factor is ridiculous, but Cole can literally disassemble Mercer's cells by the atom.   *After fight* Yep. Called it.
Alex: YOU DONT WANT TO GIVE ME YOUR POWER, FINE ILL JUST TAKE IT  Cole: pulls out uno reverse Alex: sh**
Prototype 2 was the rare example of me wanting to have a sequel remade with the original's gameplay.
Ok,but Alex is virus,not a human. So does he even have bio electricity that can be consumed?
failed ..., Mercer is better ....
I don't see it, absorbing was instant, you only had to weaken other hunters to absorb them. With people, it is so quick that you walk into their position as you absorb them.
Death battle i was wondering there is a guy got turned into a flesh bud nevermind ill get to the point  Carrion vs Alex mercer Carrion is just a flesh eating monster Alex mercer A prototype got turned into a killing machine  Who would win carrion or alex mercer
bullets hurt cole and you can level alex up to where he can block anything yall fumbled this one 💀
Glad to see my hero get some screentime once more, and what a badass cole was! good job guys
James Heller should have won …
Are the authors really sure that a person with an electric stick can block the blows of Alex, who with a slight movement of his hand sends a 20-ton IFV Bradley flying several tens of meters away?  The game did have Captain Cross shocking Alex with an electric stick and rolling around the battlefield like Sonic, but this is clearly just a funny game convention.  In Western gaming society, many view Mercer with irrational malice when it comes to comparisons with characters from their other universes (He has more fans on the Eastern Internet than Jesus).  I've seen the claim that Magneto would simply break the atomic bonds, when in fact he couldn't defeat a wheelchair user and a crowd of metal people.  Seriously, he could just unscrew the wheel of a wheelchair.
You can really tell this was an old script
Omg Yess Macgroth Is The Best!!!!!!
I’d totally want to see either Cole vs delson rowe or delson rowe vs Alex mercer, cause delson is just so busted with his power
This is for sure the worst death battle
I have no idea who either of these people are but I must now consume every single piece of media they appear in.
erm....alex used a lot of stealth and disguise as well as commanded the hunters and other organisms created by blacklight. i guess those were just totally skipped over? as well as his ability to heal through biomass? i don't wanna say they cheaped out on this one, but maybe "phoned it in" for the subject matter? also, i've not played infamous 1, but nothing they stated said that cole would actually be resistant to the blacklight infection.
Insane infamous series wasnt continued.  Such a fun game
This was phenomenal!!! 🔥
Man I was routing for Cole but I never expected him to win
I'm sorry but Mercer would win easily in my opinion... this fight hardly showed the real power that Mercer has and the brutality and brute force Mercer has. Or at least they are at the same level of power. Again thats my opinion, I truly think Alex Mercer is absolutely OP
CONVERTING MATTER INTO ENERGY I HEARD THAT HOWS NUCLEAR BOMBS ARE MADE
Tbh i was ready to see cole lose. Im so glad he didnt
James vs Cole macgrath
James heller can defeat cole mac grath
Who would win InFamous Second Son or Prototype 2?
This is straight up one of the best death battle ever done
0:05 Intro 0:41 Cole MacGrath  6:41 Alex Mercer 12:48 Fight
rigged mercer should've won
Booker Dewitt vs Jackie Estacado
infamous vs hellsing. who would win.
Game makers should make a game with these two characters and where we can control both characters!!!
Many who assume Alex is stronger don’t seem to remember, it only seems that way because Prototype has more gore in it.
let's do Dante vs Alex Mercer or Vergil vs Wesker
I’m thinking…. We will be getting a prototype 3 down the line. One with Pariah as the MC this time. 😊
Prototype is the venom game - the spiderman  Infamous is the static shock game - the melanin
I wanna see a Hayden Tenno fight
This is like peewee league against pro. No contest. Mercer obviously
Gonna be honest, I like cole a lot more, but I think alex would prolly kick his ass
I get it's powers v powers but like... The way I play Mercer? Nah, Cole's gone.
Well, we cannot tell if Cole can absorb Alex or not, but Alex CAN definitely do this. He could have done it from the first touch. The disadvantage of Alex is the distance - which is Cole’s advantage. But Alex doesn’t need to recharge too. His abilities are not limited when he’s confronted and can use massive attacks when he has little health left. Also considering Alex’s character:  “In a hypothetical battle between the two, it's challenging to determine a clear winner. Both characters have impressive abilities that could give them an edge in combat. However, considering Alex Mercer's shapeshifting abilities, regenerative capabilities, and the capacity to absorb other beings' powers and memories, he might have the upper hand in a direct confrontation.  Additionally, while Cole McGrath is resourceful and determined, Alex Mercer's ruthless and pragmatic personality might give him an advantage in combat situations where he wouldn't hesitate to use any means necessary to secure victory.”
15:12 At least hurt Cole with another mutation:❌️ "This world is dying... I'll make it better!": ✅️
Don't think he'd survive a giant blade through the gut like that lol
The strategy guide for infamous states that the shield converts the KINETIC ENERGY of the bullets into energy for cole, not the bullets themselves, and zeke on aldens tower proves that the epicenter of the raysphere is completely safe from the blast.  The strategy guide directly proves you guys just make stuff up and base stuff on pure theories and don't do actual research, because if you guys did, you would have caught this.
A third prototype game where you play as pariah, can slam through buildings, and host fights entirely on walls and in the air would be awesome!
Definitely one of the best music tracks behind the animation need voiceless version.
Altaïr be looking different after AC1
I’m not gonna lie this is one of the most badass battles I’ve ever seen
I love both these games
Infamous all the way 👏
I would like to see who will win between Commander Shepard versus Master Chief
Feel Alex should have won because of sheer duplicity.
What was the point of the vote if you were going to do both vs battles
Mofo just used the avatar state
Death battle where is Alex adaptability
Both were great  games back in the day when the PS3 was rocking 🤟🏻
Just a question on Cole here, I haven't played infamous. How was he able to get impaled by mercer and survive?
I honestly just wish they would remaster infamous 1 & 2 cause those were the best ones.
Whoa! He got divebombed!
I did not expect Cole to actually win this, but I'm glad he did. InFamous was one of my favourite franchises when I was younger, and I miss it all the same. Half as long, twice as bright.
name de la cancion
I'm now curious had they made Alex won instead would they have shown him with electricity at the end to tease he absorbed Coles powers.
Arrogant until the end, that's why James Heller won and would have won this fight to the death, when you kill someone you don't tell the story of his life
Now they should do James Heller vs Delsin Rowe
imagine this was a game, that would be awesome
Also this guy Alex would be a great combatant against Majin Buu
This guy Cole would have been a much better combatant for Static then Miles
I wish we could get a Prototype remake for the PS5. Adaptive triggers and Haptic feedback would be off the charts!
Two different video game universes, but man its so good this just feels canon.
I know Alex lost but now i wanna see him fight Delson Rowe, I wonder if Delson can absorb the virus and use it like Alex
Disney Forces Xenoverse Storyline  [InFamous Prototypes], Cole McGrath Is InFamous For His Justice
Cast Cole McGrath: Paul Guyet/Toshiyuki Morikawa Prototype X: Kevin Andrew Rivera/Masaya Matsukaze
"Now I know why that script was in the trash. I had to hear someone say 'awesomesauce'." What? I've watched this battle several times and I have no idea where "awesomesauce" is in it.
good things come to those who wait!
Legit, took me off guard my boy Cole won. I was almost certain Alex would consume him. You guys know what your doing giving Cole the edge. Alex is technically far superior to Cole given the nature of his powers, Alex can turn others into weaker variants of himself and blend into a crowd etc (play the long con.). But in a straight-up brawl Cole just STOMPS. His achievements speak for themselves.
Alex "No! Stop! Its too much!" Cole "Just giving you what you wanted."
Prototype it's quit awesome it's look like a venom in that body
PHANTOM THE PHANTOM THIEF 2 PHANTOM VS COLE MACGRATH  COLE MACGRATH DANGEROUS LEVEL 10 COLE MACGRATH BOSS FIGHT HARDEST BOSS PHANTOM VS ALEX MERCER ALEX MERCER DANGEROUS LEVEL 10 ALEX MERCER BOSS FIGHT HARDEST BOSS
Battle of the edgelords 😅
Honestly, I just wanted the fight so bad. One of the few fights I could not have cared less about who would win. It was just such a treat.
Before the battle starts i want yall to know that Alex Mercer gonna win this one simply because Alex been blown to nothing and came back consuming a crow I like Cole but delsin have a better shot at killing Alex
man what a cool animation
I can't imagine many other terryfying ways to day that getting my bioelectricity drained.
Oh my god...
For me, it didn’t matter who wins I love both franchises and both op in their own rights
Now I kinda wanna see Cole fight Gunvolt
Alex: If you won't give me your power I'll just take it!  Cole: pulls out a uno reverse card Good idea
We need a evil cole vs heller lmao
The Cole skin was my favorite skin from Uncharted 2
Tbh this should be Paxton Fettle vs Alex Mercer thematically., Both of those settings were equally dark.
So Static Shock vs Venom basically lol
It’s getting sad I can predict whose going to win based a third through the battle didn’t even watch the analysis
Imagine creating a fighting game with characters and their opponents from Death Battle, having the main story be you as the winners contending through a world in which somehow all the characters were able to be. It'd be like scaling them based on the research this channel put together on their power levels at their max potential but balancing the roster in certain play modes.  This idea might have some issues along the way and obviously not every IP would be cool with the idea so it wouldn't really make money traditionally but I think it'd be fun. Like if you'd play the game
For me it's not so much the word "awesomesauce" as it is that you use that "Great power, great responsibility" line TWICE.
I love both game grow up on them but i could have sweared that the evil ending was the connon ending
If only movies could make superhero battles look this good.
Anyone else seen Toby dancing?
God, inFamous 2 is one of my favorite games of all time. I need to dust off the old PS3 and take it for a spin.
I never played infamous but only prototype and hell even I know Cole won the fight. Watched some scenes on both infamous 1 and 2 and they just show how strong Cole was.
Swear to God, I thought Alex was going to win.
2:53 Your math is wrong. 1) You don't multiply the bullet mass by speed of light squared, but only its own velocity squared 2) you need to convert its joules to kilowatts with how much time it took to hit its target.  Lets assume the Joules of a 9mm converts to 70KW, it would light a 60W bulb for 1,100 hours
Could someone contact them about making another death battle where the teenage mutant ninja turtles fight the totally spies along with Britney?
One of favorites videos in YouTube💜
oh boring ass dude from boring ass game won
Wouldn't it take Cole like... hours to drain Alex of his bioelectricity? Considering he has the biomass of millions of people lol They actually let Cole win on a bunch of theories lol
please settle aang vs korra debate
I find it crazy they haven’t thought about Delsin Rowe as a contestant when they started to get popular around second son came out
Honestly I wanna see starkiller get a deathbattle
Cole MacGrath Winners Alexander J. Mercer Losers
Def one of the best Death Battles! The CG, fight choreography, music...PERFECT!
мерсер просто востановится из капель крови так что мерсера знатно занизили плюсом он существо что способно контролировать свою эволюцию во время боя он мог просто подстроится под атаки противника и чтобы его полностью уничтожить нужно уничтожить весь вирус даже одной вороны достаточно что бы мерсер полностью востановился
Black bolt (marvel) vs Banshee (dc)
I still hate how they changed Alex from Sociopathic but highly  intelligent anti-hero to straight-up classic bond villain (not in a good way) and is killed by a dumbass jar head who needs his hand held through most of his missions. There were some gameplay mechanics I liked in the second, but a lot of things just seemed dumb. From bad writing like Alex's villain plan and an idiot protagonist who is saved by plot to the design of the new black watch suits, which went from military Spec-ops uniforms to anime villains.
Alma Wade from F.E.A.R vs Eveline from Resident Evil 7
no way. Cole ain't that powerful
this battle was awesomesauce!
Pretty awesome
I actually went and looked at both games to learn more about both characters and it was well worth it
The infamous dude doesn't have a healing factor how did he survive being run through 2/3x
In hindsight its such a shame and a missed opportunity that there was never a prototype infamous crossover. Its like aliens vs predator, they just fit together perfectly.
hehe elektro vs carnage
«¡Hey! Ya ha llegado la reyerta, el virus más letal desde la peste negra» 🎶
3:19
Now I wanna play both games. Where can I find them?
Winner is whoever they like more as usual
Starts at 13:00
I'd love to see Alex Mercer vs Albert Wesker go head to head that'd be sick to see!
Please do one with the dude from second son it was so cool man.. personally my favorite..as a personal request to broomstick @deathbattle
This matchup is basically an unstoppable force vs an immovable object, Cole is a living nuclear reactor and Alex is a living virus capable of regenerating to insane degrees
Imagine if Alex just consumed him
Side note: technically for infamous 2 evil Cole was the Canon ending
As much as I would have liked Alex to win, I still like the ending, Two people given extraordinary powers, see the world two different ways, fighting for what they see right
CAPPPPPP
Was gonna say lara croft vs nathsn drake bit lara literally picked up thors hammer killed gods and demons
Cole should have lost here, despite the fact that he is capable of putting Mercer down, albeit at range. Mercer's physicals are far above Cole's and any punch he throws can 1 shot a human. At most he can casually send tanks flying entire city blocks per Prototype 2 and has far more impressive durability showings, being able to take multiple Tank shells and Gunship salvos and keep moving. Cole's durability is no where near that level and his surviving the initial Ray Sphere is an outlier that serves only as the vehicle for his transformation into the Prime conduit. Cole would have to stay away from Mercer and bombard him with ranged attacks, because even the weakest of Mercer's strikes would be majorly damning for Cole. A good example of something that stood out to me would be the Cannon Ball maneuver that Mercer uses against Cole in this very fight. With Muscle Mass that move can 1 shot an Apache Helicopter, but Cole blocks it here with no notable difficulties or consequences despite his durability being massively inefficient to tank that caliber of attack. Besides all that, I loved the showdown, even if it took some creative liberties for the sake of delivering a good fight.
Prototype needs a comeback
Delsin rowe vs James Heller?????
i know cole can easily win over alex but cole need to make alex weaken to absorb him but alex can infect  cole virus through the air and 1 scratch and 1 alex tentacles "meat" gets inside him😳 alex can easily absorb him
Alex vs Sukuna what do you boys think?
ngl this one feels good personally cos I know someone who insisted that Alex could beat Cole despite me telling them that nah Cole's got this in the bag.
I used to "RP" online a lot as a kid; it was pretty popular at the time, the internet was growing into its big boy pants, I liked to draw and write, and I moved a lot. So, yea.  The symbiotes from Marvel have been among my favorite types of thingies for a while, but I always wondered why they were, iunno, stupid. Like, these guys have a beastie that can form nigh limitless appendages from the surface area of their host to anything they expand to, and the appendages range from tendrils to melee weapons. It makes sense enough that they'd follow T1000 rules for what they themselves could form .. without other bits and pieces. A host, or the memories of various hosts, particularly with chemical and mechanical knowledge, could pretty easily MacGyver themselves into a Eustance Kid living weapon with near countless appendages to do all sorts of stuff with, basically limited only by their imagination and the range they can expand.. *ahem*  Anyways, so I made a character along those lines. And then Prototype came out. The end.
12:47 if you wanna just watch the battle
What music is playing its good
Man, the wrong decision, and a crappy rap fpr the track? What a double dose of disappointment
So basically Alex Mercer is Venom but juuuuust legally distinct enough to avoid getting copy righted by Marvel
I need the song during the battle by its self
I disagree that cole could absorb his bio electricity. Mercer is a virus and only mimics what it thinks a living being would be like. He has no real organs or bio electricity or anything and is constantly adapting. Viruses arnt livinh things after all. Cole has been shown to take serious damage from stab wounds as well. Fight wasnt as well researched as i had hoped. Fun video though.
YEEEEAAAAA
I still remember yelling like a freak the first time I heard Cole's last comment. Sometimes, I come back just to hear it.
I'm almost kinda disappointed Cole didn't drop Ionic Storm on Alex's ass after draining him, still an GOAT-y fight.
Let's talk about the real problem. We want a game game for both of these games
Make alternative?
This made me want a Sobe water
Alex mercer still wins
Wait, you guys said there would be no other people around for Alex to consume. How? In your Reverse Flash v Goku Black the former picks up a random person and uses him as a shield so people are in the universe why is this different for Mercer?
I was 100% Alex was about to Izuna Drop is his LMAO
Alternate ending: Cole reactivates literal vampire powers.
im so glad these two legends got to fight it out on death battle! They both were part of my childhood. I was rooting for both equaly and im liking how it turned out. i liked the justification for the winner too.
Am I the only one who thinks that the voice actor of Frieza in this sounds like LittleKuriboh? 😬
“So much power and yet you waste it on these vermin, you and I can change this world for the better" The only vermin I see here is you" very glorious lines
Oh wow I didn’t know that there was a Hot Topic vs American Eagle battle. :^)
Finally got around to watching this video and I’m so glad you guys did this. This a battle rip straight from childhood and I’m happy to see Cole win.
3:28 Actually, he is not resistant to Electricity. His own electricity can backfire and kill him if he falls in water, not to mention he killed and could be killed by Kessler's electricity as well.
Starkiller vs. Cole, then?
Mannnn the choreography was kinda boring in this fight. Also missed opportunity for evil cole and red lightning that woulda been sick
Gaming All-Stars: The Ultimate Crossover predicted Alex and Cole together!
Pinkiepie vs Mask
I'm going to honest I wanted Cole to win but didn't watch this episode until today because I thought Alex would win.
Awesomesauce
They completely ignored that Alex is an ambush predator with his ability to perfectly disguise as a innocent civilian.  They made Alex extremely stupid here, he's not going to have a punch out with a walking reactor going meltdown. He's going to hide in plain sight and stab Cole in the back.  He's an inhuman monster that preys on humans, he's insidious. That's the point.
ngl this animation was pretty goated
Ultra Lord vs Buzz Lightyear!
Love the infamous 2 references, the finishing animation, the model of the helicopter that shoots at you, the tornado, the ice blast and the storm, it's very well done, I love this battle.
Prototype 2 ruined the fledgling franchise.  They turned Alex from an anti-hero to a full blown supervillain.  No one liked the 180 change, the new protagonist was just basically Alex 2.0 so the sales tanked.  DB rarely makes mistakes but they made some here.  Saying the blacklight virus "only" works down to DNA so Cole would resist, is unfounded.  DNA controls what you are, change it by 2% and you're a chimp.  So it would NOT be reasonable to assume Cole would be resistant to ALL viruses, especially not one as virulent as blacklight.  If Cole's DNA was altered, well he wouldn't BE Cole anymore.  Cole's draining ability drains neural electricity, which is BETWEEN neurons NOT inside cells themselves.  So that "advantage" is inapplicable here.  Mind control powers =/= blacklight infection.  A viral infection is not "physically altering" as they implied.  Viruses basically use the cells to reproduce, it's not like blacklight is killing a cell and replacing it.  So Cole resisting blacklight again is unfounded.  DB also ignored how Alex could easily dodge cannon shells and survive a nuke.  Oh and he's resistant to electricity.  The Actual Winner... Alex Mercer.
Both series’ need live action adaptations.
I disagree: I think Mercer would've won, on the grounds that I only played Prototype.
Need to bring back Cole MacGrath in Infamous, would buy immediately.
James Hellen vs Delsin Rowe
Alex , who beated Kratos on another Death Battle lost toward's cole ? Stop with the biased fight's for god's sake
Pew pew vs VENOM sheild
Alex, who defeated enemies stronger than he lost to a bald cripple. This is stupid
15:10 Alex: "So much power. And yet, you waste it on these vermin. You and I can change this world for the better."  Cole: "The only "vermin" I see here is you!"
I'd take Alex powers all the way
Watching this just makes me want a Infamous 1&2 remake for new gen consoles
Whoever wrote the script for this one has some hidden talent, let’s keep it hidden 🔥🔥🔥
BEST MF PS FRANCHISE MFFFFF, INFAMOUSSSSSSSS
That’s my dawg!!
There is a lot of mis information in this video Alex is the good guy evil Alex is just a duplicate and Cole is evil the end is solid but they didn't do enough research sloppy just sloppy but still they got the end results correct
Coles cannon story is the evil path otherwise the second son game couldn't happen good Cole is weak compared to the evil Cole and the games name even suggests evil Alex wouldn't stand a chance against evil Cole has infinite power cause he feeds off the raysphere and is the rayspheer he can make new conduits
As zabina once said chemistry is just physics at a more fundamental level.
delsin slams both
Damn! I really thought that was an easy win for Mercer but Cole was awesome!
Alex win bro
I’d love to see Alex Mercer vs Jackie from the darkness
We need to force like several good studios full of talented creators to listen exclusively to Linkin Park for several years, it's the only way we get more games like these
2013 was a good year lol. This was well worth the wait!
A living biomass and electricity don't mix too well
This death battle really feels unique to a kind of a hero villain battle
Coal is the fing goat
⚖⚖⚖ SCALES ⚖⚖⚖
Thank you for reviving these franchises, if only for 20 minutes.
I like mercers story more but ill admit cole is actually pretty dang cool
I actually wish there was more of both of these games
Spoiler: They made Cole McGrath win against Alex Mercer.
just realized now, its kinda ironic that these two are fighting, even more so that cole won of the many people who belive that mercer let himself lose in prototype 2, myself included, they show footage of a boss who is holding back, and one who isent COLE, ironically, is used in the example; or more specifically, his fight with his future self they show cole hanging on by a thread as kessler throws EVERYTHING and the kitchen sink at cole in order to win, to show a boss who aint holding back, no room to catch your breath, no fancy wind ups to his attacks nothing and then they show baldur in god of war as a boss who IS holding back, doing fancy wind ups, letting the player catch their breath and all that  in this way, cole, in a way, lends evidence to mercer letting himself lose in prototype 2, because here we see what a mercer who is not holding back, even has tendrils comming out of his back which is not somthing you can do in game but would doubtless be somthing mercer could do in lore by not holding back against cole, mercer shows he was holding back against heller  although somthing else comes to mind, did cole not survive the orb that gave him his powers because of his conduit gene? i dont think its because of his durability i think its because of his gene that he survived the initial blast, as for the beast not being able to kill cole, well that could lend credence to cole being durable, or maybe conduits have a natural resistance to other conduits attacks but cole being able to resist the blacklight virus might make sense if you think about it: all of mercers cells are alive, even his feeder tendrils that consume people; i doubt mercer could consume cole easily if he is full of electricty - it'd be like somthing trying to swallow you whole if you have a suit giving off the same energy as a hundred cattle prods his tendrils aint gonna be able to get an easy hook into cole because they are getting zapped
this video is so biased. i don't even know where to start.  The Win just doesn't add up honestly.
"they could match eachother blow for blow" "Cole just had to much raw power for alex to handle"  STOP DOING THIS. PLEASE STOP. STOOOOOOOP. STOOOOOOOOP
Electricity is MY ELEMENT!!⚡️
Bro... it sounds like they actually got Cole's voice actor from Infamous 2.
Ngl a coop game with these 2 as the mcs would be perfect I also think cole would be the perfect guy to fill alexes dark soul with light
Fan love it when they say like shadow the hedgehog
I agree with the straight up, except by the end of Prototype 1 you have absorbed SO many people you'd have knowledge of damn near everything since most are military and strategy experts.  Also tinfoil, Alex getting absorbed in the second game is the virus wanting to experience being the hero.
9:31 Boomstick, you're not helping.
Lol xd, nice.
Cole when he see’s a giant man in purple armor and a giant yellow planet trying to eat the planet
This one makes me so happy! I loved these growing up.
One of their best fights, glad Cole won this. 😊
I disagree
Prototype 2 wipes the floor on this fight lol, also Alex isn’t as strong as other dude in prototype 2 - James heller
I definitely miss seeing these two games in the limelight. Hopefully new entries in the series could be on the horizon
I so badly want them to remaster both prototype games
Bs
Two games that desperately deserve a genuine HD remaster
As much as some thrilled at the outcome, while others wished for another. We can all agree that we have waited SO LONG!! For this fight to happen! And we’re glad it did.
It’s so weird hearing them insult the script over and over when it’s just normal script that is totally on par with their average videos
If these two characters met this is exactly how I would imagine it going. Cole WOULD be disgusted by Alex’s nature and intentions and him referring to himself as a God, Cole would see as utter horseshit, this feels really natural for their characters and how they would react and interact if they crossed paths
you know that alex survived atomic bomb explosion right?
Hearing "read your mind like goku's muffin button" slayed me
Well of course Cole won.  Infamous won that Yahtzee contest over a decade ago
I've waited a decade for this battle and could not be more disappointed in the results. Cole is just immune to being consumed? And being impaled does nothing to slow him down? Yall are tripping on this one. Cole for starters would never be able to keep up with Alex's speed. He also goes down fairly easy from thugs with regular guns in the games. Not to mention he'd be just as susceptible to the mercer virus as anyone else
Just love how this fight was like 2000's boss fight for Cole with Alex going through his different stages. And when Alex tried infecting Cole, I could just hear the sound of mashing the X button to resist (or whatever it was for your gaming experience)
😮I am a infamous fan I got ps3 cause of infamous when it came out but I also love Alex (prototype) beat all of them but I’m so happy that Cole took the W🥇. It was a great battle. We finally got what fans wanted from the two and it was great show.
Alex Mercer vs. Carnage
i think cole vs vergil(static shock) might've been a better matchup. similar backstories too
Cole World 🌎...
I have been asking for this death battle since prototype 2 came out. Glad to FINALLY see it done
As much as I love Alex he couldn’t keep up with Cole
Alex is stronger
Death Battles are the equivalent of anime fights without the unnecessary dialog.
These are some of my favorite game-characters of all times and frankly i was incredibly excited to hear that these two would fight one another.  These two had a lot things to speak about, both in terms of abilities, power and experience. Both had a lot of weapons/abilities to throw at each, both had healing factors, enormous level of destructional abilities and both could absorb people and they have taken down hundreds if thousands of armed militias and monsters alike.    Alex Mercer as a former scientist, were by default a lot smarter than cole and seemingly also held a lot more experience. Especially if we consider all of the memories and abilities Mercer had absorbed, in terms of both intellect and abilities. Not to mention he was also a great tactician that had fooled both the Military and the Gentech co. and had even infiltrated their ranks several times. He was also stronger in pure physic thanks to the virus and all the people he absorbed that included soldiers, infected people and other monsters in general. Not to mention thanks to his many deadly close-range weapons and stronger physic meant that he most likely had the  close-range combat in the bag. His black tendrils also could drag Cole Closer of just throw him around, which would make it harder for Cole to focus and counter-attack probably. His healing factor was also quite broken, since he could recover from just a piece of flesh after being nuked by a bomb. And unlike Cole, Mercer also did not need to absorb things to restock on power. So Mercer could even win if he could hold the fight on for long enough. So with all that said and done, Mercer definitely had a couple of things that could put Cole in a difficult situation. Unfortunately though that's where cole starts to take the lead.  Cole wasn't nearly as strong Mercer in pure strength, but he had lot of other things that mercer couldn`t counter so easily. Cole overall had a lot more control in this battle thanks to his stronger versatility alone. Cole could also trap Mercer in Ice and even in that black gooey(good power and evil power) and that alone would make it hard for Mercer to escape, especially since viruses have a tendency to work less efficient under extreme cold temperatures. While Mercer held the advantage in close combat, it didn't not mean that cole didn't have ways around it. Cole could use his amp to defend himself, use his lightning lightsaber on his arms to fight coles-range and even just protect himself with force fields, which Mercer did not really have an out to. Even Mercers tendrils could potentially be electrocuted or frozen completely if it came into contact with cole. He could also simply also just force Mercer back with tornadoes, lightning strikes and his big ice technique that could freeze a whole city block. While Mercers healing factor was superior to Cole`s healing factor, but that did not make him invincible. Even if we take the power-scaling aside, Mercers healing abilities could only do so much after a prolonged battle. Like his Battle against James Heller, where Mercer had absorsed his other infected comrades right before the fight and got a major boost. But even with that, he still lost against Heller. That at least shows even with a power boost, his healing factor did not improve so much that it would tip the scale. With that in mind and considering that all of Cole`s arsenal could hurt Mercer, it just seems a bit unlikely that Mercer would come on top. Especially since Cole had a clear advantage in fire power and range attacks. That combined with Cole`s better speed stats and power, Mercer would simply just have a hard time winning this fight.  Despite all these amazing facts about these two characters, they are somehow still human to some extent and both can still get harmed by most attacks in their opponents arsenal(even with their healing factors). Cole could potentially get pummeled down or skewed by Mercers weapons and Mercer could get fried or frozen down by Cole`s abilities. With that in mind and the fact that neither of them a had a definitive counter against each other meant that it came down to power and durability in the long run especially since both have survived enormous level of destruction. But according to the stats shown at least in this video Cole just comes out on top in the end          Mercer`s intelligent, superior strength and better healing abilities certainly gave cole a tough fight of the century, but Cole`s stronger versatility, better speed stats and greater power eventually settled this fight for good.
Fun Fact, thunder drop has a higher damage ceiling than any of Cole’s ionic abilities, it scales with height. I’d you use the car fly glitch, it one hits anything
Disagree with the overall outcome but it was still a really good fight
I really hope this did well enough to do a round two with the successors. Delsin vs James!
2:07 9:31 11:13
Alex Mercer does not rely on bioelectric force for his being. He's a multi-cellular macro virus who utilizes biomatter from megafauna (primarily humans) to achieve his form. Cole would not have been able to kill him thusly.  I'm not saying Mercer would win, I'm saying THAT is NOT how Mercer would lose.  EDIT: Why tf we got both Prototypes on steam but not both InFamouses? Wow, "infamouses" is a strange word to pluralize.
Ok❤❤❤❤
Hi death battle crew quick question whats your opinion on bowser vs eggman (mario vs sonic)
I'm ready for The Infamous Prototype. A game which revives & unites Cole & Alex for a last time to beat a greater evil together & give them a proper ending. Make it happen
cole would not win this
Thank you guys for taking in my vote! this was a hard debate between me and my family who would win. now the world will know.
Couldn't animate the bullet right?
We need an new Infamous game, it's so good
Anybody here hoping for a Death Battle involving Delsin Rowe or James Heller? 👇
They really need to do remasters of these games NOT REMAKEs they were amazing back in the day  thou
Good
If Prototype can get a remaster for modern consoles why can’t Infamous get the same treatment?
I wish infanous and infamous 2 was available again. I miss that game so much
Why did cole dodge so much stuff but alex couldnt he has litterally dodged tank shots at point blank
Wow just 2 months ago??
Awesome sauce
Pode ver presente o futuro assado peninhas do 3
now for a followup where Alex is in Coles brain
alex is More Powerful than Cole and when mercer stabbed him he should've died
Ok
Can we get a follow up with the lead character from second son vs heller from prototype 2
I LOVE BOTH THESE GAMES. These were my main power fantasy before Insomniac Spider man. I couldn't debate who could win. But im honestly glad Cole won. Sense this was Prototype 2 Alex. Who was a actual Monster by then.
Man, what kind of vendetta did you guys HAVE against this script for you to make the fight itself to look like ASS?  I've seen you do WAY better with characters that didn't even have 3d models in the first place.   Also, to be honest, I couldn't tell when you guys were and weren't trying to intentionally use TV tropes. It's just so common that we accept it at this point.
15:49 YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE ME YOUR POWER?!??! *laughs maniacally* FINE! I'LL JUST TAKE IT!!!!
7:56 I can hear the MK "Toasty" when Boomstick says "nice".
Even though I don't like infamous im happy that alex died! cuz.. he is evil....
I want  zoro vs flashy flash or  zoro vs atomic samourai!!!!!
I want to see either delson vs alex or delson vs cole
I like this death battle
I just hope the winner takes on Shadow The Hedgehog
Fun fact,Alex Mercer's weakness is electricity
Why don’t there make games like this anymore ? Superheroes are more popular than ever
I feel like this Death Battle is going to reignite interest in these two characters respective series, hopefully leading to demand for a remastered versions of their games.
ALEX WINS THEIR ARE SOME CAPS IN THIS VIDEO LIKE ALEX CAN ONLY CONSUME PPL AFTER HE WEAKEND THEM BUT WHAT HAPPEN IN THE VIDEO IS CAP ALSO HOW DID COLE DIDNT WHEN ALEX STAPPED HIM?
Tbh I wouldn't mind seeing Alex Mercer vs Jackie Estacado
This battle so f****** cool. It made my 11 year old self actually cry at how beautiful this was
Huh, well, I say they did this pretty well, i hope this satisfied those who has been asking for this for so long, ‘cause personally i think they delivered.  Anyway, Frieza vs Megatron, huh? I gotta say, this might be the most unexpected Matchup so far for me, I have been imagining some Frieza Matchups, I have been imagining some Megatron Matchups, but I have never thought of them in a Matchup with each other, mostly because i didn’t why they would, i guess they’re both conquerors per say, but even with that, I am really going to look forward to see what kind of Connection they have with each other.
huh....for once the guy with the automatic healing factor didn't win by default
The bad ending for Cole is canon though
Now imagine if this fight took place during a storm 😂
This fight was my childhood dream
Great, now what about Heller?
Ow, the edge
dont bring again alex,1 battle is enough to screw him,dont weste time on him
As a big fan of Prototype, I accept Alex's defeat, but I have my doubts that Cole would be able to kill him, I mean, if any of Alex's flesh was left behind during the fight, I think he could still make it back.
You mean to tell me this hadn't been done!?
Although im personally biased as a Prototype fan, i will say that it was a pretty even matchup and Cole had some advantages over Alex. However, i do also want to point out that Alex seems to be semi-immortal. He fully regenerated after the first game's story, and people have speculated that he would have been able to return after Heller killed him due to his arms remaining after his defeat. All in all, great matchup, and i hope Prototype and Infamous gets more attention that they deserve!
Really was a script from the 2010's lol.
Cole’s victory is all the more satisfying seeing how he literally saved humanity from a total parasite…
Do rock lee vs yugiro hanama
Biggest pander I’ve ever seen
I miss infamous.
I miss infamous.
I knew cole would in. Ever since i first asked for this way back in episode 1. But im so happy to finaly see it after all these years.
Glad to see my boy Cole pull through this one. Honestly wasn't sure if he would get absorbed by Mercer.
Mahoraga vs Doomsday
If only prototype continues
Well tbh you're forgetting about Alex's ability to adapt and gain abilities via DNA. He can potentially gain coles conduit abilities since those abilities are yes not normal they follow the x gene in marvel comics to a degree meaning Alex can arguably steal and hard counter Cole because of that. Conduits have a genetic mutation disposition to be a conduit. It's not something that can be passed down (unless that's been reconned later on) meaning their probably more similar to inhumans who again their powers are drawn from their fucky DNA.
Personally, i thought Alex would inject his virus inside Cole so that even if he dies, the Blacklight virus takes over Cole
I Just Need A INFAMOUS REMASTER OF BOTH GAMES  NO SEQUELS😭😭🗣🗣
Prototype is literally my favorite game if all time, with infamous being my second favorite, The amout of hours I put into both game on my ps3 was wild
The beheaded from dead cells vs jack from ghostrunner
Plug in infamous 2 for me
If they had a TV show, Alex would be a perfect main villain for Cole. He comes off crazy overpowered and evil, but he can die repeatedly and come back for another episode whenever Cole beats him. All the while, he's trying to get Cole to join the evil side, which is actually possible considering Evil Cole is a potential future
Pretty sure using life drain on Alex is a negative mark on Cole's karma. Good thing he'd have to do that dozens of more times before it messes with his good-guy powers.
WOOOO, let's go Cole!
I don't care who will win ok i just miss my favorite ps3 games that's it
The 2nd prototype was so bad Alex should've been the main character ngl
Kratos>>>>>>>>Alex.
the Goku vs Superman of video game characters
I just want to say thank you death battle. This was an episode for ps3 fans. I definitely appreciate this episode.
So Alex is an evil Swamp Thing kinda I guess huh yea.
Cole should've lost. Once again, Screw Attack got it wrong
HE SAID IT!  YEAAAAAAAH LET'S END THIS DEBATE ONCE AND FOR ALL YEAAAAH
Now it would be a great fight if these amazing guys did DELSIN ROWE VS JAMES HELLER.
Waited waaay too long to see this Death battle! Will they ever do Sergei Dragunov vs. Revolver Ocelot, battle of the Russian commando super spies?
Hashira vs the 9 titans
Wow I was sure that Alex would win but DAMN Cole fucked him up
Glad it happened now instead of season 2!
OMG! anyone remember these masterpieces?  I was so happy like a little girl when I saw this video
This ithe one match I have to say I don't agree with the results on. Yall even said it that Mercer can regenerate as long as there's one tiny bit of him left. The only way to kill him is to absorb him which Cole cant do. Even after exploding Mercer would be able to come back.
Both of these series deserve to be revived but especially Infamous. There's still a lot that they could do with that series and so many possibilities for more conduits  I felt like Prototype 2 significantly nerfed Mercer, he seemed way weaker than in the first game to the point that I always wondered if that was truly the same character or just something spawned from him, like how Symbiotes reproduce and the original is somewhere else.
Finally! I've been wanting this death battle between alex and cole for a long time. Thanks so much screw attack.
I lost it at muffin button! xD
In my opinion InHuman is the best song in this season, so far
Alex Mercer vs Venom would be so fire
It's kind of funny that absorbing a single helicopter bullet makes Cole magnitudes stronger than Alex.
when can we get Kratos vs asura Death battle ??? 😭
Incorrect
16:00 Now THAT was a badass kill and ending line.
could we please get a kratos vs ashura
Can you do vampire cole vs sparrow from fable 2 with glowing marks on him and cal kestis vs sparrow from fable or Nero with his dmc4/dmc5 devil bringer arm and devil trigger vs transcended Dracula and his transcendent half human half vampire son  from castlevenia shadow of darkness
I prefer Evil Cole's story, especially when he gets the beast powers at the end, making him invincible :) Otherwise good video
Great fight, but sorry, Alex Mercer has way more fighting experiencing, than Cole, compared to the amount of bodies he has consumed, even to point were he's invulnerable
Alex can heal himself as long as there's people Cole can heal himself as long as there's electricity meaning their fight in a full city could last forever
I think Mercer would have taken it.
Me personally growing with infamous makes me happy after seeing this..
This was worth the wait!
This is an awesome deathbattle but I just have one question on how Cole killed Alex. Alex is just a virus in human shape right ? But there is no instance of viruses having or needing bio electricity like humans nervous system. I mean correct me if I am wrong, Cole could've won some other way for sure or it would be a stale mate until Alex loses biomass but the way he wins in this doesn't sound right or scientifically possible to me .
Cole wouldn't have won this fight
Era só jogar o cole na água
Ichigo vs Yusuke Nick Fury vs Big Boss Sailor Moon vs Madoka Kaname
now can we get delsin vs james heller
Toph vs magneto
cap
Muffin Button!
Now we need a version with evil cole
"No, see powers don't kill people. Oh no, its the person behind the powers that kills people." - Cole MacGrath
So, wait... Is Alex Mercer the evil counterpart to Alec Holland?
Even if we assume that Cole’s force field doesn’t literally convert matter into energy, since that has never been proven to actually be possible, at the very least it can be reasonably assumed that it disassembles matter to the atomic level since the Ray Field and the Beast can do the same thing. This would involve breaking both intermolecular and intramolecular chemical bonds, allowing Cole to absorb the chemical energy released as a result of the bond breakage and become even stronger. Meanwhile, since Alex can only regenerate from molecular DNA, he would be completely unable to regenerate from the disassembled atoms. I find it funny that one of Cole’s defensive abilities alone could instantly nullify Alex’s healing factor and kill him.
Sweet tooth versus joker versus yet the clown
Who remembers the friendly art competition between both game companies in 2009? I feel like they would've loved this video 😂
Oooo
they both use magic so good luck keeping that consistent
damn the Symbiote Peter vs Miles fight looking a bit different
Oh yeah I knew it Cole killed Alex Mercer
Cole McGrath will defeat Alex Mercer
I really want to see this with the sequels
Wondering when you're going to bring that up yeah I had one thing about this we play Lightning really red and one blue one but I like the red one better and more stuff up
The one reason I clicked on this is for the first person you'll introduce I played a replay the game not even a week ago it's been so long since I've played it
15:20 as someone who played infamous as a kid this part is so much hype for me probably my favorite death battle rn
W Cole
Glad cole won. played infamous on my ps3 everyday
SO FREAKIN COOL!!!!!!! LOVE YOU GUYS VIDEOS!!!!!
Bullcrap. Lightning guy can survive being pierced and slashed to death? :D
Muffin Button
Alex stomps mid diff with both in their full power, theres a giant gap between alex in full power and cole full power, like alex became almost a god in prototype 2
They both came out the same year, the same month, they were jewels of  sandbox in their generation, and now theyre beating for who is the best
As much as i wouldve loved to see alex win, i felt like hed win
That was incredibly satisfying.
We only saw half of Alex Mercer's powers
In a gameplay sense, Alex has *WAAAAY* better in-game durability feats and somewhat more effective close combat weapons (even with the amp, which is better than the lightning blades), as well as solidly better mobility feats than any playable version of Cole with the possible exception of the Halloween special vampire Cole using his bat swarm ability, and that's more limited in its use than Alex's movement powers. On the other hand, though, Cole has *WAAAAY* better long-range damage output and a few solid range-control tools, backed up by functionally unbeatable defense against everything Alex can do at range if he can maintain distance. If you based this battle on gameplay instead of lore (which you shouldn't, just to be clear, but if you did...) then the fight would come down to a couple of major factors.  If the "fight" starts with Alex arriving in Cole's city, with Cole not knowing he's coming and Alex unaware of Cole's presence, it's an easy win for Alex. Because at some point, Alex either sees Cole and realises "dude's done up like a hero" and he's got the tactical knowledge to study a potentially powerful opponent before attacking, or consumes a random at some point and learns from doing so that Cole exists and has superpowers, and does more research. Then disguises himself as a civilian until he's walking past Cole, and suddenly shanks him with claws or cuts him in half with a blade and game over. Gameplay Cole has a pretty pathetic health pool and a few quick hits would cut him down before he could respond, and his shield doesn't stop melee attackers.  If Cole shows up where Alex lives instead, and both know each other's reputations and a bit about their powerset, Alex has much less of an advantage, *BUT* if he's smart - which he is - there's a good chance of him trying to sneak up on Cole. This probably won't work *FULLY* because Cole's bioelectric sensor pulse is likely to register Alex as being something different from a normal human, but it'll still get him closer than Cole would like before the fight starts. At this point, it's a gamble on whether Cole's able to stall and play keepaway for long enough to end Alex's healthbar or not before they get into stabbity range. This one could easily go either way, but because Cole has a few explosive tricks and loses less of his mobility while using his shield power, I think he's got a bit of an edge here... as long as there's some nearby wires to grind on.  If the fight is engaged with both fighters becoming aware of each other at longer range (say, for example, Alex getting spotted in armour form, or caught consuming someone), then it's solidly in Cole's favour, with the range advantage being both offensive and defensive - his HP isn't any higher at range, but his shield means it doesn't need to be, and his firepower is more reliable and versatile than Alex can bring to the party while rivalling the heaviest hits Alex could send his way in return. He's got abilities which could stall Alex long enough to negate the HP advantage, and interrupt attempts to flee as well, so it doesn't even turn into a stalemate.  All that said, my biggest problem with the video's lore-based analysis is that you point to Alex needing to weaken his enemies to consume them when that's not entirely true, and don't bring up the same weakness for Cole when it's significantly more true for him. Alex has stealth consume skills which can allow him to eat any human and even some superhuman opponents if he can avoid being recognised prior to the attack. Even when it's true for Alex, many enemies he can consume can still be active and fighting as long as he hurts them enough, Cole specifically needs to incapacitate a target so they can't struggle free of him while he leeches their energy, and even then, a more heavily weakened enemy than the ones Alex can consume is able to put up a solid fight against Cole while he's channeling his power into the attempt at siphoning their life energy. Incapacitating normal humans is laughably easy, and even some low-level superhumans can reliably be one-shotted into a vulnerable state, but he needs a notable amount more effort to do the same to a more powerful enemy, which Alex would qualify as. Doesn't change the winner, but I don't think that particular ability is what would actually and the fight. Massive atomising sky lightning attack is a much more plausible option for a win condition.
What do you about death battle between Alex mercer and Albert Wesker
This is bullsh*t, I don't admit this defeat
Wow, this is a 2013 match up lol
Is Alex word to kill and absorb Cole would that mean Alex gets his powers?
Evil Cole would've made this WAY more bloody.
Fun fact: Alex is weak against electric
I loved Prototype....until they made Alex Mercer the antagonist. I liked him better as an Anti-hero, but no...we had to settle for the Miles Morales clone edge lord that was just stereotypically an angry black man.
God, I had no idea that they were so similar 😅
Part two: Delsin rowe from infamous second son vs. The black guy from protype 2
I was always saying I want to see Mercer appear on Death Battle, so here I am glad to find out incredibly late
I was thinking about Alex survived the nuclear explosion so he couldn't die from that final blow but then I realized. Huh, Alex is already dead, just a virus controlling him, so it takes the Blacklight virus to find another victim and "test" his body until the success.
Please do Mori Jin from God of highschool
I miss this aspect of Death Battle, this was truly one their best battles yet. Not only are they both from great franchises, but this battle felt like an official battle between the two. With Cole being the hero and Alex the villian. We need more Death Battles like these. The 3D battles need to make more appearances
Who let bro cook
The flood vs the X Parasites or the Metroids.
this is the coolest episode of death battle of all time
Surprised that this actually was made by you guys. So many edited Death Battle thumbnails from back then of this battle with so many scrubs trashing on Cole.
12:58 , fight
16:09
Eminem 2008 vs enimen 2023
Albert Wesker vs Alex mercer
Where is  both prototypes game are being sold ps4
How about delsin rowe vs sylar from heroes
I Fckn ADORE Prototype.
It’s so nice to see cole. And he caught a w
Cole was such an awesome character, back when original games pioneered the way
Unicron vs Galactus when?
This would make a great crossover game
Excellent graphics and soundtrack. You continue to impress.
Lord do I miss Cole to this day man.
As much i hate to see Alex lose but he can lose to Cole, because his weakness is electricity
What is this song
are those prototype animations not just spiderman animations??
Whoever reading this, God loves you.🙏🏽
Y’all should add a spoiler warning section, I don’t read manga but I watch anime and I didn’t know Frieza got a new form.
At some point can we get Captain Planet vs Toxic Crusaders, Gizmoduck (Ducktales) vs Inspector Gadget, Superdoo (ducktales) vs Meteor Man,   Imhotep vs Mumm-Rah and Bruce Leroy - The Last Dragon (the glow) vs Gabriel Yulaw (the one) how many times must I post this request I gave almost a season worth of content
Johnny-5 / Wall-E  Vanquished, Sam / Halo, John-117  Mercer, Alex / Venom, Marvel  No Man’s Sky, the traveler / Starfield, Dusty   These are the fights that should also take place..
What about infamous vs prototype part 2 Delson vs heller
Actually, cole macgrath came back to life because in Infamous 2, a lightning bolt accidentally struck in the coffin and resurrect him and he appeared in Festival of blood.
Why is the music in these new fights so damn loud? The Mix is awful and honestly having lyrics in the background music is really distracting, they should go back to instrumental music, not ever fight needs it own song.
I'm Cole McGrath fan and did expect him to lose. But wow. On Spyro vs Crash, I'm Spyro fan and him to win glad he did. Not happy with Twilight Sparkle vs Raven and Batman vs Black panther
Im probably  looking too deep into this but does anyone find it highly coincidental that this death battle came before Marvels Spiderman 2. An open world superhero game featuring two characters with similar powers alex and coles. Both their introduction opened with spiderman so.
I see now why you guys threw this script away
Completely bull****
inFAMOUS was and still is my fave game of all time. Granted so know it’s not what most would consider the most polished or most graphically advanced. But Sucker Punch really made something super special to me ❤️
EPICAS BATALLAS DEL RAP DEL FRIKISMO
Greeeat, another victory because some dude paid them a lot of money to ignore all of the facts.
Battle Fake.
Up!
yall are like 15 years late on this one. still cool tho
I'll take symbiote anytime
This is a dream come true. I really wish prototype had a movie
Now I want a follow up of Delson Rowe vs James Heller. DBX anyone?
ALEX NEEDS TO BE IN THE NEXT PLAYSTATION ALL STARS BATTLE ROYALE!
ALEX IS SO COOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Now do the MC from Infamous 2 and the MC from Prototype 2 vs each other.
This is so impossible Cole makes me feel like I'm weak
Cole: "Im the final product, you?.. you are just a prototype"
Friendly reminder: the outcomes of these fights are determined by Patreon polls, not who would actually win.  Never forget the pickled abortion that was Ben 10 VS Green Lantern
Ok but would Alex be able to beat delsin Rowe? He doesn't have Cole's abilities so would Alex beat him?
You guys should totally do darth vader vs vecna
Fact- Electricity can kill viruses.
I was honestly expecting the mercer virus (thats not the real mercer) to win since he can survive damn near anything
Boomstick wat you mean I just watched it twice and didn't hear anyone say 'awsome sauce' if that was in the og script but not here then Y even bring it up dude this was still a Kickass vid im happy I'm watched it twice
i disagree pretty hard conduits are far more vulnerable to physical attacks then they are energy attacks, gun fire can seriously harm cole even temporarily. alex has a solid shot of just overwhelming coles defenses and eating him
THAT'S WHY HE'S THE GOAT  THE GOOOOAAAAAT
Even though Alex Mercer lost, he should make a comeback and go against Generator Rex
This is legit one of the best death battles I've personally ever seen!
PROTOTYPE MENTIONED??? IM IN HEAVEN
15:51 the fight ended right here.  How cole somehow survived being stabbed by that is fukn stupid
i cant believe i forgot about my obsession with Infamous
Great matchup!!
No I need Alex vs muzan
2 of my FAVOURITE characters from 7th Gen gaming. LET'S GO!
I wont lie the presentation of this deathbattle definitely paints Cole as a Hero, and thus protagonist energy. Its no wonder he won while it also feels... correct.   Ive never played either game series but this sort of thing did keep me engaged. Especially at the end where it seemed like Cole was going to get absorbed, only for his own power to surge and just defy the darkness.
Wtg enserio perdio alex? Xf
Ajirr seharusnya menang alex
You either die a hero. Or you live long enough to become the villain.
This made me wish that Jack Joyce (Quantum Break) vs Jesse Faden (Control) have a death battle, the battle of time and space.
Whts the sound track
Not enough nuclear power to kill him, but enough lightning power? That's absurd.
Listen I love infamous but thats straight up cap. Mercer would simply regenerate. Mf survived a nuclear grenade and you're telling me an electric suplex killed him? I smell cap.
One of only two times I was happy to have guessed wrong about the outcome of the fight. The other, for anyone wondering, was Ghost Rider vs Lobo.
I owned both of these games back in the day, and they were both amazing. Infamous was a much more polished game, but goddamn Prototype let you elbow drop a tank. I can’t compete with that.
Bruh brandon yates is the walter white of death battle music
We need DMC Devil May Cry Dante VS DMC5 Dante, DMC Devil May Cry should be after his final fight with Vergil, and DMC5 Dante, without a doubt before he gains Sin Devil Trigger, since DMC Dante doesnt have something like that for obvious reasons, but still DMC5 Dante should however have all his weapons in the 5th game, minus the Devil Sword Dante of course
I don’t understand why everyone wants the worst character to win and the best character losing
Honestly, as long as Cole had electricity, he could just shock Alex off of him, if Alex tried to consume him. And if he did run out, just consuming Alex’s bio-electricity would just make Alex a battery for Cole to continue shocking Alex.  Though before I watched the fight, I hadn’t considered that maybe the best way to beat Alex, would be to freeze him.  I’m surprised that in Prototype, that Blackwatch didn’t attempt Liquid Nitrogen weapons to stop Alex in his tracks, by flash freezing his biomass.
Ms.Marvel Battle Royale: Carol Danvers vs Sharon Ventura vs Karla Sofen vsKamala Khan
I still wish they didn't kill off Colel in the second game, he was such a great protagonist.
Cole is my childhood hero
Really just underplayed Alexs armor, dude wasnt taking any damage and it just dropped outta no where? Alex Mercer wins all day with high difficulty, but he still wins all day.
Hellraiser vs Freddy Krueger
I still believe alex would have won mainly because of his healing factor and actual versatility
After seeing some Spiderman 2 gameplay, imagine these games with todays tech 🥵🥵
Cole’s powers 1:34 1:59 2:10 Alex’s Powers 7:14 7:36 8:13 Nice name 8:49 Death Battle 13:08 Inhuman best song 13:32 14:02 15:27 Winner 15:57
I like this battle. I also like how united the community is on this one.  Initially, I thought that Alex would win, simply because he is a literal nightmare of a bioweapon that had to be killed by a better version of the virus than himself to be taken out in the end. But in the end, seeing just how many powers Cole actually had, and exactly what he could do with them.... yeah, i can see why the battle concluded like this. I don't think I mind this ending.   thank you for finally making it.
I KNEW MY BOY COLE COULD OVERCOME OFF BRAND VENOM
One of the few DB results that i actually agree with, damn i miss infamous and prototype
I freaking loved playing infamous. I would love to see a remaster for current gen tech. and I am not talking about second son...
You knew not to used James against cole, cole would have no chance🤫
Honestly surprised this one finally happened after a decade
I'm 30 and still waiting for Prototype 3 :'(
I feel like Alex Mercer vs Venom would be a great battle
oh neat! worse static shock vs worse carnage.
Please do a death between (underworld) Selene Vs. Alice (resident evil)
This is disgusting. You're insane if you think Alex is losing here.
Anyone wonder what if the blacklight virus infected Cole(sp?)?
Wow I Wasn't Expecting That?
This can now go under, Microsoft vs. Sony
my dog passed away the same day when this episode was released
The old saying from star wars, "With great power comes great responsibility"
Literally two of my favorite game duology when I was younger. I remember always playing evil first. Cole gets red and black lightning in the end of the first one if you go full evil and I thought it was so cool
How much budget do you have? _Yes_
no way, they're draw
Cole should’ve been dead with the first punch.   Alex mercer is literally the same strength as the hulk.
I knew this fight was in their files somewhere. There needs to be a new infamous and prototype
Im sorry, but no. This deathbattle is so factually wrong it's not even funny. I'm not saying this to be a prototype fanatic, I'm telling you this is factually wrong and I can give several logical details and reasons as to why.  1. He did NOT tank the blast of the raysphere, this is a myth. While from a first glance it looks like that is the case, a major detail people are overlooking is that the ground he was laying on was completely unburnt,even still having the yellow driving paint. This implies that the raysphere had a built in field or barrier that would protect the user from the force of the blast. When Kessler said he was worried Cole wouldn't survive the blast, he was referring to the fact that the raysphere was a rushed and malfunctioning prototype known to kill the user. The actual damage he took from the raysphere malfunction was more on the lvl of a grenade blowing up in his face. Impressive, but it still massively lowers the impressiveness of this feat. If Cole can't survive a direct hit from an RPG, there's no way in Hell he took a nuclear lvl blast head on. While Alex wasn't at the center of his nuke, he didn't have to be. The nuke was designed to wipe not just the city and infected, but was also designed to desintegrate the entire land mass of New York. He was still in the radius of this bomb and yet a piece of him was still able to survive that on top of the radiation damage that piece without a doubt would have taken. You bring up how the beasts explosion was larger than that of the p1 nuke, but this is pointless info as Cole wasn't anywhere near the radius of that explosion, he was unconscious on a boat half way to new murray.  2. Cole being immune to Sasha's power is only half true. While yes he was shown completely immune to her mind control ability of her tar, he still suffered adverse effects from it such as Sasha being able to communicate to him via a telepathic link, she was able to make him hallucinate giant reapers that could do physical damage to him, and direct contact with the tar effected his biology causing him to have a lower energy capacity. If he can be that badly effected by a conduit power despite being one of the more powerful conduits, then he cant possibly be immune to the effects of blacklight as the virus has been known to cause cannibalistic madness, bodily mutation, and organ failure in so cases.  And for people who are gonna bring up the empire city plague, that wasn't a virus. It wasn't even a disease, it was the result of people getting sick from rayfield radiation exposure which all conduits are immune to. It's not because he was immune to disease. There's nothing to suggest he ever was. Him being immune to disease is a baseless claim with nothing supporting it other than he didn't catch anything in his 2 only games.  3. You talk about how he beat the beast after using the RFI like it was a feat, it's not. Saying that he was on par with the beast because he used the RFI is literally the equivalent of saying Batman is on par with Superman because he brought kryptonite. You don't get it, the beast wasn't just some op conduit, it was on the lvl of nigh-omnipotence. When cole and Zeke hit it with a tsar Bomb direct hit, it merely gathered it's scattered ray field particles and put itself back together. In the final fight, it walked through a large naval force on top of a city filled with both militia and laroaches men on top of both Cole and nix both being powerhouse conduits. Neither man nor Conduit could harm it in anyway. It was only once Cole started using the RFI's energy that the beast finally started showing signs of slowing down and weakness. This isn't a feat, because it wasn't Cole's normal energy he was firing at. If you take the evil route, Nix has been shown to be able to weaken and almost kill the beast with the RFI, meaning anyone with the RFI can do this, not just Cole, but anyone conduit or not.  4. Cole fighting more dangerous opponents again is only half true. The most dangerous opponent he's ever face  not counting the beast isn't even Kessler, it's alden. He was capable of lifting metal regardless of it's weight with the power of his mind. Alden was far more powerful than Cole, Cole even admits as much upon their first meet. The only reason Cole won against Alden was because as Kessler said, he had squandered his potential. He could have just chucked the nearest bus at Cole and Cole wouldn't be able to stop it, instead, he creates a giant metallic construct he pilot to fight. Which gives Cole a fighting chance.  As for Kessler. He's not as strong as your making him out to be. Unlike Cole, Kessler wasn't at the center of his raysphere explosion, meaning Cole was far stronger, he put up such a good fight though because he's far more experienced with his power with cole. Cole had only a few weeks with his power during the time whereas Kessler had several decades. If time would have allowed it, Cole would have eventually developed the exact same abilities as Kessler only even more powerful.  5. Your wording on Cole's bioleech make you sound like your being purely hypothetical and dont know if his bioleech would actually interfere with mercers regeneration or not. You not even taking into account the amount of mass mercer would have and there for not taking into consideration how much energy he would contain. Every person Cole ever bioleeched was either human lvl with human mass, and conduits with human mass. He's never done it to someone like mercer who has enough mass to cover an entire city. Cole takes longer to drain an energy source the more energy the source has, logic would dictate this to be the case for biological beings as well. This is all assuming Alex would even give him the chance to pull it off. He struggle doing it to an older weaker version of himself. There's no way he'd with a physical struggle against a guy who can throw an apc with 1 hand  6. This is something you actually failed to bring up when talking about Cole, and that is blackouts and water are his greatest weaknesses. Water fries him and a blackout makes him physically weaker as he even states. The second mercer sees Cole absorbing electricity, Alex is gonna immediately connect the dots and either go for the main power grid to destroy it or simply cut Cole's arms off. Don't tell me he wouldn't figure it out. Anyone could figure out that an electric guys would get his power from electricity     I could continue on forever but I think I made my self clear this video is wrong  I like Cole too guys, I like him personality wise far more than mercer. Mercer is a sociopath who only cares about his sister whereas  Cole cares about everyone. However, he doesnt have wolverine lvl endurance or near hulk lvl durability, he can't regenerate bones or destroyed organs, he can't destroy buildings with his bare hands, and if it were an actual nuke in his hands in empire city, even if his conduit gene was active, he'd be ash.
I love Alex Mercer, this game gave me my childhood, unfortunately I’m not familiar with the Infamous series, but I think the battle was good, and I’m very glad that they showed Mercer’s armor, it was one of the coolest and most impressive things in the game
Well I definitely didn't expect to (Technically) appear in Death Battle but I'm pretty sure that's my footage at 3:24 of the gigawatt blades, (For context I saw that the blades still didn't have much good quality footage online and I had them so decided to do it myself) not something I expected to hear from my comment section but I'm not complaining, happy to be of service I guess.
Sugestão: Boku no hero vs x men  Só com personagens que tem os mesmo poderes ou poderes parecidos  Mirio togata vs kitty lince negra Toga vs mística Anjo vs hawks  Aizawa vs decompositor  Piro vs endeavor  Homem de gelo vs todoroki so lado do gelo E assim por diante.
Of course cole macgrath can't be defeated unless he is going up against delsin rowe
Is that cole macgrath going up against Nathan drake?
Krillin: "HOW'D YOU SURVIVE!!!!!" Gohan: "DONT SAY MUFFIN BUTTO....." Goku: 'Muffin Button..." XD TFS quotes make my life
Not sure why it took this long to mske this fight happen.   Cole winning is laughable considering differences in sheer aggression between the him and Mercer.
"Half as long twice as bright." Can't beat the Prime Conduit and the Patron Saint of New Marais.
ALEX MERCER VS COLE MACGRATH has been going on for DECADES! look it up in google and youtube, infamous vs prototype is as old as the universe
I miss these guys. They should come back.
Long time coming. Why these IPs aren't used anymore, I'll never know.
So we're gonna forget that Alex survived a nuke? That his healing can't be matched...
I love Alex Mercer but I sure understand the outcome great job guys I loved the animation it rocked 😎
Let’s go, I love cole, it’s sad they didn’t continue after the evil ending of 2
I loved imfamous 1 and 2 so much, second son is trash
Can you make the hulk vs the thing?
When did it ever explain that Cole could read minds that's what I want to know I spent 30 minutes to an hour trying to look it up Google sucks now to trying to look up anything. What is iPhones searchengine called cuz I'm thinking about switching to iPhone now
I hate Google it's working typing this. Anywho I don't remember in any game ever saying that Cole can read minds it might have been in the side quest or something but that wasn't one of his main powers right? I'm saying I hate Google because I can't find any information on Google anymore like I Google has too much information I can't find sh**
Is it dumb of me to ask for Cole McGrath vs Static Shock?
As amazing this episode was, it’s such a shame that Sony and Activision (now owned by Micro$oft somehow) have been sleeping on these iconic franchises for way too long….
saved manhattan, then terrorized manhattan 'badass-ly ironic'
Yeah i think prototype just now has electrical powers and looks like Cole. I really don't love either series so I'm ok with the result.
I would love for them do to a revamp of Kratos vs Spawn, though I’m sure we know how that’ll end I just feel like the video that was made wasn’t done right and needed to be done right…right?
This just makes me want to see Static Shock vs. Venom. Would give similar vibes.
Death battle request! How about Jebus vs Zeus (MADNESS: project nexus vs God Of War)
Hopefully if this DB is super successful we'll get a Delsin Rowe vs James Heller. That'd be fun to see
I love Cole MacGrath. Definitely my favorite character of all time.
I can't agree with the outcome, Cole can't regenerate from being cut in half unlike Alex can. I also don't think it's fair that y'all gave Cole his energy sources and not give Alex victims around the city to eat like he usually does. Alex scientifically should contain more bio electricity than the average person since he is more than human. He claims in the game that he is all the people he consumed. Alex is faster and stronger than Cole, there's barley a thing he can do after he chops an arm off.
My first 2 sandbox and favorite games when I got my first PS3. Definitely would love to see Prototype return on the 5.
I love how every coupon code that DEATH BATTLE! provides sound brutal with no exception.
13:49
I literally started replaying Infamous right before I noticed this exists
Alex Mercer vs Venom
Infamous was such a great series, Hell the main reason i got a ps4 was for second son.
This fight was a yawn. Everybody knew Cole was gonna win. The best part about this fight was the music.
I always forget that cole can absorbe too
Prototype ftw. Loved the game back then, Alex Mercer was so cool. It sucks that these games didn't continue anymore
The fact is, Alex Mercer got shot and died at Penn Station, that's the virus which now pretends to be Alex Mercer.. (the virus evolved and has a hive mentality)
That came out of nowhere.. 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Do Neo vs wesker (The matrix vs resident evil) next please
Now we need Prototype 2 vs Infamous Second Son
Ain't no way alex merca lost
man this death battle brought me back, even tho i wasnt there when infamous released, i played the living hell out of it, and still do on occasions today, i hope they bring back these two kickass games again!
These Death Battles are getting shittier and shittier🤦🏻‍♂️
14:20   Miss hearing the prototype theme…
Those 2 games are underrated.  Deserve reboots….
Infamous & Prototype would make great live action movies….
Now I’m imagining an alternate plot line of infamous 2 where instead of the beast tearing through the United States it’s alex Mercer instead
Well there’s one thing Alex Mercer has over Cole: Mercer’s games have been rereleased on other consoles and Steam, while Cole’s are still stuck on the PS3.
omfg thank you guys so much for making this me and my buddy have been arguing about this since these games came out and I always was of the opinion that Cole would be the one more likely to win. All the years of being called an idiot are finally behind me 😂
will not look at the comments! not looking at the comments! not looking at the comments!
Calling bs on this one
Very strange seeing this matchup in 2023
кринж мерсер соло
yeah no...
Death battle takes remain to be so worthless. In no world should Cole  beat alex
Mysterio Vs Scarecrow
honestly how can you forget in your analysis to say - Alex was super vulnerable to stupid electric baton that was used by the agent"Specialist Cross", and that boss fight was a b*tch because of it. So anything else alex has, is useless when he is unable to even touch the Cole guy. I do like Alex more, but this battle was never even a question.
doesn't cole also have vampire powers from that dlc
Great fight, but I refuse to believe Alex would lose.
this is so bs alex should have one
Yet the lightning bolt isn't mentioned from the end of 2 which signals that Coles still alive. But it does kinda suck that the good guy always wins
Imagine there was a fight between Lucy vs magneto. Now that would be epic.
So in the beginning yall state you're using good Cole and his abilities yet you mention the use of bio leech but isnt that one of his evil abilities???
R.I.P these series. They are so cool, and I especially loved the inFamous series.
Buds made green lantern be able to kill a child but didn't made Coul bad enough to have deadly abilities...and made him use evil power that Good Cowl actively avoiding
Still hoping for Albert Wesker vs Alex Mercer
Should’ve had Alex vs Carnage
Cool
Geralt vs lann mandragon
I WAS LITERALLY SCREAMING ROOTING FOR COLE. YOU DONT KNOW HOW LONG IVE WANTED A DEATH BATTLE WITH COLE IN IT
finally death battle do a battle of a epicas batallas de rap del frikismo xd
I dont know if cole could survive all that damage
my 14 year old self is freaking hyped from this video!
Paw patrol vs super wings
Infamous was cool but I never went back to either after beating them, never liked prototype enough to finish
"Well, that just happened" ugh "He's right behind me isn't he?" UUUUUGH
One thing that didn't make sense was that Coles weapon could block Alex's blades . Normally you guy's talk about everything but not this time . And it seems like cole can run out of power . Alex only consumes to heal and use special abilities but most of his powers are still there . But I guess we're not going to talk about that.
nice lets see evil cole vs good cole death battle
I'm really hoping since we got this, that means we can get Delsin Rowe vs James Heller
Im sad they Aint inculde nixs power
God you guys are so wrong about so many fights its incredible.
Bro we gotta get Starkiller
I remember commenting for this exact video way back when, and now we finally got it. Thank you Death Battle for brining me back to my childhood and letting me live it out. You guys are awesome and this video was awesome.
Can you please animate the Dresden Files? This looked amazing.
“How? Why? Don’t worry about it it’s a nothing burger” So you’re gonna say that about Alex getting powers accidentally from his own research but Cole surviving the equivalent of a nuke and getting powers is treated as perfectly normal? What a nothing burger statement.
I remember reading about Infamous 1 and 2 in 'Game Informer' magazines lol good times
I LIKE THAT YOU ALSO SHOWED THEIR BACKSTORY. I GOT HOOKED
I'm glad Cole won although I feel like it would have made more sense if he was evil because of how much more powerful he is.
I always liked Alex Mercer as a character in the first game. So much potential. And yet they did him dirty in the second game and turned him into the standard "megalomaniac evil guy". Prototype 1 was a great game (second can go F itself) and could have been a start of a great new franchise with mr. Mcgribbly Gribbleson at the helm if handled properly.
I wonder what the movie that cole had after he defeated alex was  like:  Probably something like:  "I don't know what i expected, this "mercer" guy  wasn't like any conduit i've ever faced before. The guy was nuts. But the thing about any of these crazed bastards is this: I will always do what it takes to protect my loved ones."
Completing the absurd arc for regaining your powers in Prototype 1 was hands down one of the most satisfying experiences in all of gaming.
Mercer vs wesker? Lol
my guess is Alex wins because that mfer can survive a nuke.... hes deadpool meets venom on steroids.
I wanna see delsin from infamous second son in one some day
There's a bunch of death battles that are debatable... I think they make it so on purpose for more disagreements coursing more viewers
I just realized this this matchup is essentially an edgier version of Spider-Man vs Venom.
Wow what a battle. What I wouldn’t give to be able to control electricity.
I’ve been begging for these characters to fight since the 2014
Alright! I'll be the one to say it😪 Broomstick's attractive 🤣 love the vid btw!!
How tf did cole beat someone that survived a nuclear attack😂😂
we need more Infamous great games alot of fun Cole was a great character glad to  see Cole won this
I think this match lack to much details.  Like rhe damn virus adapting to electricity and about ice that wouldn't really work much it can burn it self.  And the versions is aa bit weird like you need to kill off all infected because the virus it self it alex somehow.  It would be nice if alex bring some to swarm the enemy for a little time.  But nah if it was an fight to the death at level 1 on both sides alex wins.  And in reality rhe virus can actually dapat and just copy paste and evolve DNA so that's going to be an irritating thing seeing real fights.
wrong
it’s only fitting to do james heller and delsin next
It was a battle between matter and raw energy It was obvious electricity will win
12:59
A very unexpected ending but I can accept it 🤔
says alex mercers cant die. proceeds to lose and die
Would love to see a Raoh vs Yujio Hanma death battle. Nothing beats two big muscle mans dukeing it out
you skipped over half of alex's powers, this just looks like an ego jerk off to the community favorite
love the match up love the games letss goooooo
Finally the guy I was rooting for wins
Thank yall so much for doing this death battle. I honestly gave up hope on ever seeing it
Death battle: the bomb affected everything on a molecular level while the virus only works on the dna level there for the virus is ineffective  Also death battle: even though his powers affect your molecules his power affect your dna, which means he can rewrite the very structure that makes you who you are
People sure find genius ways to deal with things other people think are cheat powers (Like Alex's regeneration vs Cole's bio-energy absorption). A couple months ago there was a wasp and I sprayed it with a can of hairspray... it was at that moment I found out that creating a "sticky mist" can counter all those "swarm" baddies you see in video games and movies
Question about Alex’s armor transformation. Is that the true form of the black light virus itself? Or is it just another power/ability of Alex?
Dude going in I thought Cole was SCREWED    And god im happy i was wrong, hell yea, love Infamous, wish it was still around
So this is the very first Playstation vs Xbox episode
I loved this fight, but I call hacks at the end. If Alex started absorbing Cole it should've instantly been game over. The anime BS of him instead absorbing Alex's bio-electricity doesn't make much sense when you realize that is very a small ability Cole uses on basic enemies who are already downed laying on the ground. Alex's entire move-set and being revolves around absorbing and eating people. Their justification of Cole's forcefield especially doesn't make sense because Cole wasn't using a forcefield in that moment he was completely open AND had Mercer's giant sword impaled through his chest making consumption even easier. He was obviously injured enough to be absorbed or Mercer wouldn't have tried. The only person to ever resist consumption was James Heller and that's explicitly stated is because of Heller's unusual and resilient D.N.A. Not because he wasn't injured enough. The more I think about this the more I think Alex should've won hands down, still an awesome fight with great animations, however.
I'm so glad you guys finally did this battle
Mmmm.  Good one.
Something I love and hate about Prototype is the nature of the infected. Alex is a powerful individual and in most universes would powerstomp most MCs, but in the high end universe like DC or Marvel, where god like entites are commonplace he would get absolutely rolled. However, even if they kill Alex, they can't stop the infection, and eventually more Prototypes and evolved will be born and cause even more destruction. Even if they win the battle, they can't win the war.
I loved both of these games 😢
I kinda love the recurring gag of this episode's script being filled with outdated jokes and one-liners
Imagine showing this to a 2010s kid that grew up playing these franchises
Ok ngl it took me 2 rewatches to appreciate the “script-wrote-in-2013” joke, all the outdated videogame references, Boomstick ex-wife jokes and hearing Wiz say “Lets end this debate once and for all” brought back so many memories 😭🥺  I love Death Battle
Finally two interesting characters
Sucker Punch doesn't make games often....but god do they put out hits.
I want to see a Commander Shepard vs anyone. As long as Shep wins 😂
Cap Alex mercer survived nuke and then he didn’t survive this technique that colonel did at end and I saw yeah it is true that they are fighting but they forgot the full power out and infection virus out and ability that punch ground will all ground be broke
Do a edits about this fight using this song  E.T x Industry Baby Mashups
I wish they remade Prototype 1. I used to play that game all day long and it would be sick to get an upgraded graphics version of that game.
It makes sense given the subtypes of games they're from. Prototype has more stealth elements because Alex isnt straight up strong enough to resolve the situation by himself. However, being hunted by Alex would be a fresh new hell, what with him stalking you wearing the face of someone you love. Cole is more powerful, but Alex is more horrifying.
absolutely only meat riding on this channel☠️
I actually found this because me and one of my buddies were trying to decide on Alex Mercer vs Shinichi Izumi Parasyte. Btw can I just say the fact people still remember Prototype makes me so happy, those games were early 2000s awesomeness incarnate.
These battles be legendary 😂💯🔥🤗🤔
This is so wicked
Alex would bust Cole's ass
they gotta do one with delsin rowe now
Do Peter Parker vs Miles Morales!!!!!
I personally think evil delsin rowe would wreck both of them, he is pretty much like rogue from xmen on steroids and he keeps the powers he took permanently   which brings me to this idea for a death battle between evil delsin from infamous second son vs all for one from my hero academia  with regards to this episode, I can't help but feel nostalgic, i played both games/series when i was young, I also witnessed both good cole and alex died in their games and their lore played part on the deciding factor.  cole defeated his maker which is an alternate version of himself who was more experienced and powerful before sacrificing himself to save the world  alex on the other hand was eliminated by something he created with similar abilities and stopping his plan on changing the world  loved both series  ps. I am really hoping for a sequel for both series, a continuation of second son good and bad karma storyline and especially for prototype. I still think Activision did alex mercer dirty in the second installment plus i have high hopes for Elizabeth greene's son Paraiah being the next main protagonist/antagonist
DO marvels MR.fantastic vs D.c plastic man
Wasted opportunity to put the prototype mc against cell from dbz, they definitely match together better.
Cole MacGrath deserves a freakin reboot🪖
Maybe this vid can have a part 2 ( with the characters from the sequel games) 👀👀👀
Both of these games series were some of my favorites back in the PS3 days, so I've been waiting for this battle for quite a while.
If Cole is stronger than Alex, why can Alex ran faster, jump higher, and sprint up walls? The scaling is so wierd. You're discounting the actual evidence in the games themselves. Helicopters are boss battles in Infamous games. They are fodder in Prototype.
I have held the position that Cole would beat Mercer since I was 14. I am now 25.  God this is catharsis
no longer popular thats for sure, but forever relevant. both these games are legendary.
I never thought this death battle woupd actually happened. I figured they forgot about these characters completely. But then this hapoened and it's like my childhood dream had finally came true
"If you won't give me your power, then I'll just take it."  "Good idea."  *It was at this moment that Alex realized... he fucked up*
Alternative title: shadow vs kirby
Sly cooper versus Garrett from Thief dark project!
How about marvel's jean grey as the dark phoenix from xmen vs dc's dr manhattan from watchmen. They are both powerful cosmic entities and the teams they represent like xmen, their world is divided between mutants and humans, and watchmen their world is divided between masked vigilantes and civilians.
Had to do Hero Cole cause Infamous Cole would completely eradicate this man.
can you do kumagawa from medaka box?
Are you kidding me? Frieza vs Megatron? Who thinks that that tin-can can beat a planet buster?
Delsin would've also stomped Alex Mercer, easily.
Imagine if Alex mercer consumed Doomsday and carnage 💀
Infamous needs another game bro it’s series are amazing
That was badass
Finally *"Prottype!"*
Alex win no diff
Dammit, this battle now makes me want another game from each series. Lord knows if  my prayers will be answered though. 😞
the virus only needs to weaken other virus users and is bio not mental. if alex was able to get close enough he would definitely have been able to infect cole and win. but 99/100 times cole would win even when ambushed cus of his detection and dissintigration powers.
I am VERY happy for Cole getting the win.
I think Alex wins this fight,,,, great fight tho.
They literally just put my childhood against each other 😂😢
oh wow i wasnt expecting this video
This is all cap
Cole VS James heller
Always nice to see other people remember Cole
Its alright, but i wouldnt mind a re-write for this one😅
15:58 Take it, huh? Thanks for the idea, parasite!
Common Death Battle L
This was such a satisfying battle.
That was awesome! I couldn't help but watch it with Linkin Park music (fits perfect lol). And we only had to wait 10 years. 😂😅Although I still think that Alex would have won simply because Cole would not have resisted all those huge wounds, since he can disintegrate things at an atomic level but he doesn't heal as quickly as Alex and he needs to absorb more than Alex does to heal. You cut off an arm or his head and he's done. And that giant blade in the chest definitely must have killed him. But I think it was more because of a plot issue in his picked-from-the-trash script. The battle of the good guy against the bad guy (Alex even talks like an old comic book supervillain xd).The pleasure that in the end good triumphs. A little cliché but it works.
At some point can we get Captain Planet vs Toxic Crusaders, Gizmoduck (Ducktales) vs Inspector Gadget, Superdoo (ducktales) vs Meteor Man, Imhotep vs Mumm-Rah and Bruce Leroy - The Last Dragon (the glow) vs Gabriel Yulaw (the one)
Damn thought Alex would turn Cole into paste because of those gameplay mechanics from the early days. Cole dies to gunfire! Alex butchers the guys Cole has a hard time taking down in the games!   Damn I wish Cole has those slick moves like in the game T_T
This Is the Type Of Fights We Want To See
Man cole magraph was my childhood
Ahhh childhood dream bucket list just got a drop lighter
Clicking newest first and seeing the angry Alex Mercer fanboys brings back memories of the early 2010's, when he was one of the most obnoxiously over hyped characters in vs debates, you had his fanboys saying he could beat the likes of Superman and the Hulk.
I think the only chance Alex Mercer really ever has is a sneak attack and immediately absorbing Cole, otherwise, Cole outmatches Alex in almost every regard aside from healing ability
Delsin Rowe Vs. James Heller next?!
Think about it; in lore, both of them died, but Alex was subdued by a slightly less evil person with powers similar to him. Cole on the other hand died by his own decision and in the process killed every Conduit in the world while also culling a whole virus! And while he only was able to do so because the device he used to do so was specifically designed to neutralize radiation, he had to be strong enough to activate it in the first place. Enough energy to control lightning from the clouds!
Bruce Leroy vs Black Dynamite please
Phew! Can you imagine Alex with electric powers? Though that would be pretty cool and he'd live up to the codename Zeus.
Pls goku vs gojo satoru
This is why I hate Death Battle nowadays. They just subvert the obvious winners for the “wow” factor. Mercer doesn’t need to weaken people to consume them. In P2 he consumed several evolved without effort. The second he stabbed Cole the fight should been effectively over. As that would’ve put the black light virus inside Cole which would’ve had the rest of the fight to spread through his body. The final shot was held onto so long I expected Cole to collapse onto the ground and transform into Alex.
Can we see swamp thing vs man thing
More of a reason to get sequels 2 both these games..
Was expecting Mercer to take on The Thing creature, considering they both are cellular infectors and shape shift into disguises and create weapons out of their bodies.
huh, that was not the result I was expecting
It is still a weird result, considering the VASTLY different scale of their games, but I am not sure I can disagree with it
Rigged
Why are they going with good Cole when evil Cole was the canon version?
Here are some ideas: Blaze the Cat vs Starfire Bumblebee vs Wasp Katana vs Karai TMNT
Cap
A good day for us Coles!
karate kid from  legion of superheros vs iron fist marvel
Awesome animation. Could we possibly get a Dr. Manhattan Death Battle.
no sir no sir. thats a reach and you know it.
Loved the fight, but whatever music you picked did NOT fit the mood at all. It was nothing but a mumble in the background of explosions, screams, and powers. Lyrical music is too cringe for battles and no-one will change my mind on that.
RIP to all the alt superhero games that got dropped like a hot pocket someone forgot to let cool off
This takes me back 😂
Hey can you do another Goku versus Superman because since Goku has new transformations it could really be a new challenge for Superman
This is where the fun begins
Great stuff as always... Honestly while i often don't want to set my bet in stone too early this was the one time I did... Cloe at the very least can out put a enough electricity to sublimise metals...
Can we just appreciate the bgm for the fight... and tell me the name of it please
This was a epic battle
Alex: "You can't beat me, Cole. I am a god!" Cole: "You're not a god, you're a parasite!"
Soo, what I took from this Alex is Perfect Cell
Alex should of won that
THATS MY GOAT
The fight was awesome 👍🏾
Activision Vs Sucker Punch Productions Be Like:
Deadpool vs ban from the seven deadly sin, the nine tailed fox from naruto vs the great ape from dragon ball , pennywise vs the  fear dude from the green lantern movie
Yep, there goes my load
Death battle really has come a long way , glad im here to see it
The soundtrack kinda sounds like Eminem music
InFamous Second Son is my favourite work of art I've ever seen. Before watching, I am hoping Cole wins.
i could have sword these were the same character lol
One thing I disliked about [Prototype] series is James Heller is deemed a hero. But he is also the blacklight virus.
another case where they have the more popular character win while the more powerful "clear winner" gets beat bc they don't use even half of his powers... yawn. more  of death battle's bias.
2 of my favorite characters from way back, it was amazing🥲.
If there was enough people,  Cole would literally have no chance of winning
I like how this video starts with Deathbattle basiclly admitting they've run out of ideas and are having to dig through the garbage for old ones now. That explains a lot of recent matchups
I feel this verdict was off based on the Assumption of their molecular structures and their ability to affect that structure for both of them
I thought this would end differently, but I loved it none-the-less. Alex has more immediately lethal attacks, like blades and such, so I was curious to see how Cole would get over his regeneration and lethality.
Disagree
They should make a show for each of these games and have a crossover season that leads up to this fight . The fight scene was hard btw 🔥👌🏽
I wanted Cole to win to begin with(because I played and like inFAMOUS), but as they described what goes on in Prototype I was thinking Cole was gonna lose brutally. I will happily take being wrong here😁

it wouldnt have changed the outcome of the fight but i would have liked to see alex try and disguise jhimself as a civilian to get a quick backstab off on cole  cole wouldnt have been able to see through the disguise because the virus literaly becomes the  person it absorbs so this likely would have worked to momentarily confuse cole  however as stated it wouldn't have changed the outcome
Do Asura from Asura's wrath vs Kratos from God of war
Awesome dead battle match 😎
Muffin button? At least quote off the actual anime sheesh lol
I read that as Mat Mercer...... was very confused for a moment.....
Re-upload?
BAKI vs OHMA (KENGAN ASHURA)
Cap.
Okay if there’s a actual scientist out there, correct me if I’m wrong (pretty sure I’m not) but A virus doesn’t produce bio electricity, so Cole is not draining Alex, and the attack Cole used at the end didn’t look even half as powerful as a nuke so I’m completely confused on how that killed Alex, and they left out a lot of Alex’s abilities he could’ve used here
Just imagine Alex Mercer vs Deadpool 🤣
megatrom vs frieza? maaan megatron gonna wipe isn’t he
Nope!
Heya i have my question Now im make the Kirill vs uzi with death battle with real
This is badly researched as Alex can just get powers just by consuming a drop if blood he got hunter's claws by consuming them if he just gets Cole's blood he'll become a conduit too
Shortgame Mercer loses like shown here. Long game if he was how he would actually be he would steal any genetic abilities and memories of important targets before taking out his main one in order to get stronger. An accurate mercer is much more effective he would have memories, Abilities and know how to exactly use them. and since death battle likes getting rid of characters morality just to have them kill at the end: Prototype 2 mercer infects a city himself and since he is the virus he is still alive.. in some form even after beating the game.. he's a living virus not a person. potentially able to xenomorph out of people too.
👇Alex Mercer TEAMS!!!
Adam Jensen (Deus Ex) vs V (Cyberpunk 2077)😮
Death battle ahold do omni man vs jiren or inuyasha be ichi go
song??
Did this mf Alex copy Sonic the Hedgehog's Spin Dash Homing Attack?
Yo that fight was so sick!! 🔥🔥🔥
Man i miss Cole ... he was Badass  But i still think Alex eould have won
I have actually wondered in the past who would be stronger. I was surprised actually by the ending. Thank you Death Battle <3 Childhood memory unlocked <3
Sigh Cole my beloved
I'll never know why I always confuse these two games
These are literally the two games I played the most in my childhood. Watching these two go head to head takes me back to some good times.
That was one heck of a death battle I'm glad Cole won
o7 to my boy Mercer hope he goes to virus heaven.
This was actually as good ending to me
How could a bio electric superhuman beat an actual parasitic being…. Even with the facts listed, that makes no sense 🧐
So is nobody is gonna talk about the muffin button ?
So is nobody is gonna talk about the muffin button ?
I remember asking for this fight like a LONG time ago lmao I'm glad to see it happen
THE EQUALIZER VS JOHN WICK do it do it do it
I wish good Cole wasn’t canon he’s so lame
To be fair,  we never got to see the full power of what Alex was capable of. I'm mad he lost but I still feel like overall he's the much cooler character with more fun powers.
Luffy vs mr fantastic
Got a good matchup. Goku and vegeta jr vs trunks and goten
I waited over 10 years for this
PLS DO ZORO VS MUZAN
DO ZORO VS MUZAN
Day 1 of asking death battle to do Erron Black vs Cole Cassidy
nostalgic af, played both of these games a long time ago
Spawn vs Ghost rider???
How can he survive getting impaled by the gut? The guy from Infamous doesn’t have a heal factor or did I miss something?
PLEASE DO DELSIN ROWE VS JAMES HELLER NEXT
J. Jonah Jameson: He doesn't wanna be famous then ill make him INFAMOUS!
Based.
12:57 is where the fight begins
The music is so bad
Neo Contra vs Gungrave GORE
I actually get annoyed that prototype got compared to infamous. Prototype is an awful game compared to infamous
Day 8 Of supporting Wobblewok Vs Sephirioph
Huh. Okay. I'm curious to see how Megatron stands up against the galaxy-buster that is Golden Frieza. I don't know much about Transformers lore, so that'll be a neat one.
Evil Cole vs Alex would be a one shot because Evil Cole would literally absorb him as soon as the fight started.
I don't know I feel like Alex got gyped on at least one of his powers that was a main focus of the game.  Disguise.  Also if this is "good guy" cole then we've got a bit of a DQ issue here as the Bio leach power is purely an evil move.
Have they ever done jago vs ryu?
Lol, I was literally just replaying Prototype.
12:59
It's great I just wish you guys did this back when Monty was still alive the animation would have been lit
5:10 you know no one ever talks about it but this was actually the one thing that always bothered me about that game it didn't matter which ending you chose the good or bad either way millions of people still died
So now we NEED delsin from second son and james heller from Prototype 2
BRO U KNOW WHAT BE COOL IF LUFFY FOUGHT SPONGEBOB
How cool would it be that evil delsin rowe from infamous second son vs. Good Heller from prototype 2
HUNK (Resident Evil) vs. Ghost (Call of Duty)  Quan Chi (Mortal Kombat) vs. Pin Head (HellRaiser)  Geras (Mortal Kombat) vs. Imhotep (The Mummy)
I miss infamous. Second sun is my jam
Think Cole deals with villains with more varied powers while Alex really only dealt with people with similar powers to himself so Cole has more Improv skills. Also would assume the Ice powers would slow down Alex's regen powers since he'd be suffering from a bit of Frostbite on top of the electrical burns. Played both franchises and definitely think Cole takes the win.
Not sure if this would change the result, but isn’t Cole weak to water? Couldn’t Alex just kill Cole by tossing him in the ocean or submerge him?
I wonder if cole could copy mikoto misakas powers of vice versa
PERIOD COLE 🗣️
Cole is 🥶
You guys should do a death battle between Megamind and Gru.
*looks at the next match* y'all think Megatron can touch Frieza...someone who ends planets for funsies?
cole vs heller
i for real need to know, hippo vs moose science needs these answers
Just so people know, Alex Mercer let himself get killed my heller in prototype 2
I was thinking about a game a few weeks ago i owned years ago that i forgot the name of, it was prototype 😂
I thought it was Conor McGregor vs Alex perreira
ADA WONG VS NINA WILLIAMS
Has super man vs sentry been done yet?
Ooo!!! If we are doing old requests, I’m gonna resubmit my bid for bionicle’s makuta teridax vs outlast’s the walrider
Why did it sound like an unreleased Linkin Park song in the background? This was one heck of a battle. Brought back a ton of nostalgia!
Evil playthrough on inFAMOUS 2, was incredible.
12:57
Damn. Nice. I was worried they would make alex win just because in gameplay he is stronger and faster and he seems way stronger against humans, guns, tanks, helicopters etc ... But cole is way stronger in lore and against supernatural enemies, with way stronger feats.
I still want a Starfleet Away Team vs Jedi and Padawan.   I honestly geeked out with this one. Not for the franchises, of which I am indeed a fan. But rather for the science behind this fight.
I said it once and I’ll say it again, Cole becoming the beast is the right choice.
Read minds like Goku's muffin button. By the gods I almost spat coffee on my phone! 😂
Do a fight free for all the owca agent’s in phinese and ferb
What happened to blue apron?
YAAAS, my boy Cole lving up my PS3/PS4 past.😢
At the end Cole was like : ok this dude is different and just turned 1 lv up😅
Day one of asking for Cable (X-men) vs Cyborg (DC)
Can we see gildart of fairy tail vs shank of one piece since they look soo much alike but are so different?
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I've written a prototype 3 that is awesome so remember this comment if you become rich and want to fund it hahaha
Seeing this, I feel like I want to watch someday a Death Battle of Gunvolt(Azure Striker Gunvolt) vs Laxus Dreyar(Fairy Tail)
Guess you can say this matchup is now... Infamous?
Idk, I disagree wholeheartedly with the result. If Alex and Cole was to race in a 100 yard dash, Alex would undoubtedly win. If Alex was was to punch or slice Cole with full force, Alex would come out as the victor. It’s crazy to think that Cole would win due to the degree of his survival with the Ray Sphere versus a being like Alex that literally can’t die from missile explosions. Cole will literally die if he’s thrown in water 😂 nostalgic match up, but I hate the end result.
The first time hearing a trap beat over an analysis In death battle😂
Spider-Man: Uh, why is Electro and Carnage fighting?
This episode took 10 years to make. But it was all worth it.
Surprising. I remember playing both and this was a conversation point for a while. Alex throwing tanks around like toys made me think he could just rip apart Cole. The Beast thing does put a little power curve on that idea.
you just ended an argument i had with my best friend 10 years ago
Frieza versus Megatron is one thing, but what about Frieza versus CYBERtron? Is the Transformers homeworld a planet (and robot in disguise) that Frieza cannot destroy?
Can someone help explain this to me? DB is scaling Cole to the Beast, and I don’t understand where that’s coming from?   Sure, he defeated the Beast, but he didn’t just “do it on his own.”  The man had help from another conduit, a bunch of “cores”/mcguffins, and the RFI that boosted his power. Did Cole get this during this battle?   If not, he feels way highballed in terms of power and durability.
Let's see George of the jungle vs Tarzan
As a Prototype fan. I accept the defeat. I was in intense who will win. I love cole too but love alex more than him but yet this defeat was honourable. Fights between 2 legendaries was magnificent. I hope and wish prototype and infamous revive again in future ❤
After playing Infamous and Prototype for years I've had an obsession with making bad decisions and good decisions playing other games even if it doesn't support it idk thats just me ❤️🔥
When will we see Escanor vs. Whitebeard smh.
Two awesome but forgotten characters going back to life. G-old! Thank you very much!
The hero we didn't deserve but the one we needed
This is Cole Macgrath Vs Alex Mercer now next we need Delsin Rowe Vs James Heller
не ожидал такого конца. я недооценил Электрика.
Do Evil Cole
please do vandalieu(death mage) vs big mon( one piece).
Of all the franchises to need a remake/reboot it's these two.
Basically the formula for death battle is: The more aggressive opponent is the one who loses
Do james heller ?
Infamos vs second son??
They should realse prototype 3
we need kratos vs doomcslayer
Anyone else notice that before the fight started, Wiz said "Let's end this debate once and for all" instead of "we've run the data for all possibilities"? I know it's probably due to the joke that the script was made back in 2013, back when they still said "let's end this debate once and for all", but god it feels good to hear that again.
Wow this battle got me, i never imagined a battle between them, but the idea is very good. One of the best Death Battles. A battle with Delsin would be cool too.
kinda unbiased i like the way it went for the most parr
Hey Deathbattle Violence Jack vs Solomon Grundy, HEY DEAFBAFFLE!! BAKI VS TOUGH VS KENGAN ASHURA. SAMURAI DEEPER KYO VS BLADE OF THE IMMORTAL VS NINJA SCROLL LOL ALL THR 0:12  WAY TO THE BANK!!
Hey Deathbattle give the people what they want Guyver vs Genocyber!!! Karas vs MD Geist!! Your already doing anime so do these battles already!! Damn it!!😢 BTW you should've done Elfen Lied vs Tetsuo from Akira not effing Magneto.
I have a suggestion for another Death Battle: Chief Thunder from Killer Instinct vs Nightwolf from Mortal Kombat
I want to see Cole vs Static Shock now.
I mean cole is fast as hell but alex durability is crazy tho
I'm glad they took as long as they did. The animation came out amazing!
Miss you Infamous! I still would pay to see a comeback! Cole had a great story where it even got it's own small comic book!
I miss infamous so much 😔
Nah Alex would win this.
Cole wins flawless victory fatality.
Half as long, twice as bright
Just now realizing that this would've been a wash if this was the Cole that went down the evil route.
Cole winning makes a lot of sense. Most of Alex's piwer as seen in the game is his ability to control other monsters with his powers, not his ability to use the powers themselves. Especially since he eventually dies to a man with a much smaller, weaker arsenal of the same power.
at first i agreed with the result but being the mercer can harness someone's abilities by absorbing their dna he would have incorporated coles the first time he bled. which would have given mercer the same atomic level abilities. the only way cole really could have won is if he took out mercer without getting wounded.
InFamous and Prototype are now truly unforgettable
Next Kevin Levin vs Absorbing man
Didn’t Cole become a vampire at one point
SPAWN VS. GHOST RIDER
Having played Infamous 1 and 2, I am glad Cole won; thought Alex would win, but I'm glad I was wrong.
Jesus, what happened to the 3D animators? what a downgrade...
We need to see ash vs red
can we see starkiller vs Anakin Skywalker Prime non vader (ahsoka series) Thanks!
Still waiting for the most useless deathbattle of all time: Orco (MotU) vs Oon (Wheeled Warriors)
Yall next one should be Son Gohan vs Jin Kazama
Wat?
Thank you! this was over due! Great Match up I don't care if the characters are in the gaming eye anymore. Alucard vs The Penitent one! Metroivania battle
L take
Possibly the best episode since Raiden vs Wolverine,  or Snake vs Sam
Cole should've used bio leech from the starts
never thought alex would be finished off by a (im assuming) karmic overload 15:58 and a bio-leech/ thunderdrop combo 16:00, was expecting an ionic power to do it but cole did that previously, 14:25 ionic freeze, 15:00 ionic vortex and 15:20 ionic storm no ionic drain, thats evil cole exclusive ;P
I love how the first PROTOTYPE game set itself up to be able to walk back Alex being evil (and dead) from PROTOTYPE 2. At the end of the first game Alex was blown to pieces. They could totally due a story line about a different piece that survived the explosion and didn't go through the stuff that made the Alex from game 2 evil.
destroy all humans v mars attacks
Damn it
Baki vs omma toketa
MY BOYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Azula vs Kuvira
Anyway you can do luffy (one piece) vs Mr fantastic (fantastic 4)???:)
There’s not many heroes/villains in any universe I wouldn’t put a fully charged Cole against. He’s the best original video game character of all time.
Time for Zena vs Elektra. I don’t think yall have touched those two yet.
Another advantage that Cole has Over Alex: Alex’s healing factor needs fuel too, he has to absorb biomass to reconstitute himself. Since death battle is 1-on-1 fights, this means that for Alex to properly heal himself when his biomass reserves got low, he would only be able to try and absorb cole, which is not a good idea since it requires him to touch the dude who’s a walking taser. By contrast cole just needs to absorb electricity to heal, something that can be found in abundance in a modern city even with death battle’s 1-on-1 rule.
MONKEY D. LUFFY VS MR. FANTASTIC (ONE PIECE VS MARVEL) MAKE IT HAPPEN
Leon vs hitman
1 million views!
Genuinely alex should have won but eh whatever
Marvel or dc just need to buy out these franchises…I think they would be unique enough to each get movies…granted I think prototype would be a dc project.
I just realized that Alex Mercer is a kind of Generator Rex
Insane amount of geek Roland Des chain from the dark tower series vs Dresdon  from the Dresdon files and this is the most geek thing I could think of cus there are very few people who know both book series
This is a pretty sick battle honestly, it felt like a classic superhero movie battle
I don't remember Cole having regeneration powers if he gets impaled and loosing a limb. All Alex had to do was slice him into pieces.
I miss infamous
I want metal bat (one punch man) vs scout (team fortress 2)
Some Death Battle ideas: Battle of the Monster Hunters: Richter Belmont (Castlevania) vs Geralt of Rivia (Witcher) Battle of the Criminal Heros: Joker (PS5) vs Giorno Giovana or Jolyne Kujo (Jojo) Battle of the Assassins: Ezio Auditore (Assassin's Creed) vs Agent 47 (Hitman)
Can i recommend u do Girl from Nowhere (Nanno), And Stranger Things (Eleven.)
A very pleasant surprise  of an outcome
The true factor here is Mercers final boss lookin style
I wanted Cole to win, but bro, he dies from 10 bullets from regular guns, HOW did he survive getting stabbed in the chest with that massive bio-sword arm?
Worth the 13 year wait
Unfair animation. Cole got recharged, Alex wasnt. Kinda bs
5:20 I will die on the hill that Cole actually choosing to kill people in the "good" ending is the morally bad ending. In the "bad" ending he makes as many people immune as possible by giving them powers. The virus could come back even without him and powers seem to come back. So essentially the game's morals were wrong making Cole a mass murderer.
I am glad cole won
I think this just made me realize how much I miss the PS3/360 era.
You fellas most likely have one or two comments like these picking apart your videos or trying to do your job better than you. I am not trying to disreguard the work you do or what timeframe you have to accomplish it or say that the end result of this video was poor, esoecially considering it was an old format script from years ago. So, getting into the meat of the matter, here's a detailed explonation of why I think this fight could have gone differently. Overall you did a fantastic job, way more thorough than I can accomplish as of writing this comment but you did overlook some bery key details about Alex, particularly his experience and creativity.  Resonably speaking  and as an overview for this whole comment in case ya don't want to read the full explination.  Coles abilities are largely dependant on some sorce of energy, while Alex is only dependant on some source of bio organic material to heal injuries and supply his MOST devistating powers. Alex has a greater wealth of knowledge than Cole could ever collect in his time scanning the recent memories of people and Coles major reliance on his Comduit powers.   Alex does not need to recharge his wider variety of powers, the critical mass abilities being the only acception. On the other hand when Cole uses any kind of intense ability, electricity grenades for example, there is a significant drop in his stored charge. Without a steady source of power Cole would eventually run out of power while Alex would still be able to fight very easily, even if cole could still use ice that would only help him temporarily as those powers still require some electricity from what I recall. I could easily be mistaken, though even with access to ice without a drain on his stored charge Alex can easily move out of the way or even counter those attacks. At the very least Alex woukd simply be able to jump above the ice.   Alex has consumed at least a few hundred people, many of which are military commandos with training, not to menion all the civilians who could have any number of memories on self defense or aggresive training. With the memories of all the people Alex has consumed he could create several different faccimilies of fighting styles ALL of which could cripple someone in a one on one fight. My understanding of conduits is that they aren't that physically remarkable when you take away their powers apart from their regenerstion factor which in Coles' case can being him back from death though only if his body remains largely in one piece, we have yet to see an example of a conduit surviving decapitstion which theoretically Alex could do.  Most likely, the minute Alex encountered Cole and they had their initial clash Alex would be able to understand they are equals in terms of abilities. Although Alex's arsenal is largely close quarters he still has the ability to deceive cole, all Alex would need is a single moment when Cole couldnt see him to choose a disguise from the multitude he would have access too in order to fool Cole into trusting or wanting to help him and long story short consume Cole. Alex does not need to wear down a human to consume them and even if Cole is more durable because of his ability to regenerate this could be completely negated if Alex were to break Coles neck. Cole is able to bring himself back from a lot but the major problem is that it takes time, once Cole is down for the count Alex could consume him. Even with a regeneration factor matching the consumption of biomass it would be an eventual loss for Cole, his body would be trying to repair the damage of a broken neck and severed nervosystem while the infection of blacklight would be draining his bodies resources and ultimately win the battle of cellular attrition.  But let's say Cole could heal in time to escape consumption, having learned Alex can disguise himself and will try to incapacitate him first. Alex most likely would have had time to extract some of Coles genetic memory, and thus memories or how Coles electro and crio kinesis work and what is needed to power them. Keep in mind Alex is capable of running indefinitely while carrying a fully grown person. If Alex can get ahold of Cole in any way and get them both away from a power grid Cole would be finished, unable to juice up like he could normally. Even by draining the bioelectricity of living things it would be a far weaker yield than he's used too, while Alex doesnt need his food to be alive to use their biomass.   Ultimately the deciding factor of the whole fight would be Alex's greater wealth of experience, and Coles dependance on external sources of power to fuel his abilities.  If you've gotten this far, thank you for reading. Please note im not an expert and I may have missed several things or not taken something into account, like how Cole can akso extract memories, theoretically given enough time Cole could balance his physical skill with his conduit powers. But, Alex can process memories AND experience in way less time, and effectively use the information. They are both op characters, and the guys on DB can only think about a matchup for so long before they need to invest time in another project. Ultimately tjis video was extremely mentally stimulating, two unstoppable forces who can effectively battle for a long time in the right circumstances especially in the right environment. Thank you Wizz and bolmstick for making your content, flawed as it might be. And I eagerly await the responses of anyone determined to get this far in my comment, best wishes  - The Wanderer
Absolute Garbage. I've played both games, and frankly they seriously low balled Alex here. The man has survived *much* worse than anything Alex could throw at him, and frankly it's a matter of scale of their respective franchises. I'd go into more detail, but I've already signed my death warrant by disagreeing with the 'official' result.
We been waiting 12 years for this though
Could we get the guy from the darness video game vs someone?
The next death battle is a joke
Kratos vs Asura
Captain America (Marvel) vs Soldier Boy (The Boys)
How predictable, I knew he was going to win and that way without knowing either of the two characters. At least it was entertaining.
Fire Storm vs Human Torch?!?!
Ragnar Lothbrok vs John Snow
I hope Alex lose to fight to col
I LOVED inFAMOUS when i was younger thankyou for reminding me of it. Time to dust off the old ps3
Oh, I disagree with this one, Alex is not slower than Cole haha
From a moral standpoint, I am glad that Cole won the DB. That said, I have more experience playing Prototype than inFamous.
Static shock vs Cole MacGrath make it happen
When are we getting the wiz vs boomstick death battle?
Ok, but didn't Cole have such a crippling weakness to water that he was unable to hold a cellphone or take a shower without his own electricity turning on him?
Can you make one of KRATOS VS SUN WUKONG
Hey wiz and boomstick can you do mario vs sonic 2023 if not can you do Nintendo vs PlayStation vs Xbox total war
An unexpected win. Having played Infamous 1 & 2, at first I thought there was no way for Cole to win but I didn't think he would be this strong. The better fighter won in the end
Marie Moreau VS Rissoto Nero
The abridged reference 👌🏼
So he got stabbed 2 times in the chess and still won? How is he not deathv
Why the hell did Cole survive getting stabbed the way he did
should've animated good and evil cole fights
Hold up, how is Megatron anywhere near Freeza's level? Even base level Freeza is a planet buster, not to mention final form Freeza.
I thought zero punctuation already settled this.
You guys really need to do Tarzan vs mowgli
Im sorry but mercer should have won that. Cole should have died 2x already. The giant blade stab was overkill. I like cole but i have prototype 1 and 2 on PS4 so i know what Alex can do as well as cole. Alex was too much. James Heller was the perfect person to deal with Alex. A potential God vs a God.
And yet another battle where one opponent is so powerful the other has no chance of winning, just give up the death battle and call it what it really is, brutal murder for public viewing
Baki (Baki Hanma) vs. Ohma (Kengan Ashura) Just went through my head... I thought it would be a really cool fight
Dude I wanna see Palpatine go against Cole Macgrath
Muffin button?!
Man, I love (good) Cole so this was such a feel-good watch. I need to play through the first two Infamous games again.
Cap
xenomorph vs  Zerg tyranids vs necromorph necromorph vs flood
That song is a banger and perfor this fight
Spoiler    prototype definitely WIns at 15:50 Cole cannot regenerate his flesh at all. The blade through him would have been game over
Alex would slap cole this video is fake news
Nah they did this wrong
AMAZING. This is EXACTLY what I wished for from a fight between Cole and Alex. Thanks DB!
We need omha tokita vs Baki hanma
This was amazing i miss those games
Great video
Bro Frieza vs. Megatron? How is that even fair? Optimus Prime scales far beyond even Zeno. How is Frieza gonna do anything to his arch-nemesis?
Do a death battle between Forest Gump & Water Boy
monk/wizard v. barbarian lol
Question for the infamous experts:  How durable is Cole? I ask because if Alex grazes a bus while hes running, then the bus will be sent flying in the other direction - the guy is VERY physically strong Can Cole handle a bear hug from a guy with that kind of physical strength?
@death battle please let megatron win 😂😂
Basicly a who would win energy or matter.
Finally a battle I agree with, but y’all got a long way to bring me back into liking you guys again
Alex Mercer needs to fight Wolverine
i have a suggestion for a future death battle.   Kokushibo (Demon Slayer) Vs Duskmon (Digimon frontier/season 4) these two demons share a similar origin story and element it would be a battle between two incredibly strong and powerful demons with Brother issues.
Its about DAMN TIME we see Megatron
yoi these animations are getting intense 🤣
So who write that script?
I still felt like Alex should’ve won with all the people he absorbed he should’ve had better hand to hand combat skills and tactical thinking but that was never really proved in the games. I was actually hoping Alex would regenerate after the big attack since Cole shouldn’t have known how powerful his regeneration was leading to claws coming from his back  as he tried to walk away tired after using a large attack but that’s just me. All in all it was pretty sweet seeing my two favorite games back in the day duke it out
Unfortunate we didn't see vampire Cole lol
Meet riding stop the cap
Been waiting on this battle for over 10 years. 10 years!!!
Frieza vs Megatron? Is this a joke ? Black frieza solo the whole transformers verse in literally split second
NOW THIS IS A DEATH BATTLE‼️
Kinda want to see Nito v Lich
Man, Death Battle really loves pretending that the weaker, worse character would win.
Spawn Vs Ghost Rider
Mila (Dead or Alive) vs Vanessa (Virtua Fighter)
Now what we need is a co-op game where one player is Alex and the other is Cole, and they team up against some truly horrid threat.
Wait wait wait, why is frieza taking on a gun?
Ahh….the good old days when games were good.
Gonna be honest this feels like one big boss battle for both characters in some kind of crossover dlc for infamous and I love it
Frieza is obliterating Megatron but I still want to hear their stats
After seen Upcoming Battle between Frieza and Megatron  Me: i hate fandom
Recently did a run of prototype, about to do a prototype 2 run, tuen gonna download infamous 2 or second son becuase those games are awesome
This was such a great fight i wish they made theyre own superhero universe centered around just video games and comics.
They totally should've used the disguise skill that Mercer had. He could've had an upper advantage
Current frieza absolutely violates megatron
Love all ur stuff my guy. This fight though, didn't really care who won. Good stuff though. Keep it up
One thing about Death Battle... they be having the coldest songs playin 😆
Everyone talking about how the fight was... and I'm sitting here absolutely baffled by the next fight.
Have you ever thought Timmy and SpongeBob?
The human torch vs Natsu
It's probably one of their best videos
Spawn vs. Amazo
Yujiro Hanma vs. Akuma
So am I the only one who wants to know what happened to mogg slothman  the  puppet  did they eat him please someone at death battle please answer this question
Furry hunting license anyone?
Keyblade ya lo planteó en Epicas Batallas del Frikismo hace 4 años
Can you guys create a three way death battle video between Jason Bourne and James Bond and Ethan Hunt, please?
i remember why i stopped watching this channel, this is so horribly wrong that i cant even start to disagree.
Damn both of these games were amazing
Well f in chat for nemesis am I right
So surprised by that ending.  Feel like Cole is way weaker when I play him lol.
Calling bs ..there's alot of other ahis they didn't take in consideration anyone who played prototyped knows he steath base. Hes sneaks up on harder foes beat them up before they have tine to react and absords them lol..but what ever...this isnt prototype style.  Miear woukd never start a crazy fight like this
W battle i didnt expect this to happen!!!
Mercer is immune to electricity sadly
Now if it was james,he would have won
I CALLED IT!!!!! FRIEZA VS MEGATRON
James heller bs Delsin Rowe next?
Spawn vs mk scorpion
Two characters that should be in MK1
Superman vs Omni man
Hands down best fight on death battle
Jun Sekibayashi vs Zangief when?
Listen to this Arthur Morgan from red dead redemption 2 vs Joel from the last of us
Do Jin Sakai be Samurai Jack lol
Cole faster than Alex? No. Not even lol
I'm not sure how I feel about seeing an alien who can blow up planets at will fighting a transforming gun who can barely beat a truck.
So not only did he win the lingerie contest, he won the death battle too. Electricity powers are weird like that.
Big facts
I love both franchises, but glad Cole won by bias. I thought Alex would win due to how diverse his powerset seems to be. These are still the only open world games based on a non-mainstream superhero/supervillain character you play as. Need more of these, and I don't just mean like Cyberpunk 2077 where everybody has tech or Saints Row which just went offrails since the 3rd game. I mean a whole new open world superhuman game.
I'm surprised but pleased. Infamous needs to make a comeback
I'm glad Cole won, who knows maybe one day I will buy Infamous
Sebastian Vs Sebas(Black Butler Vs Overlord) BATTLE OF THE BUTLERS!!!
Haven't heard anyone say awesome sauce since I watch troll hunter
Now the next one should be up against jackie estacado from the darkness
The second I saw Cole grind down Alex's tentacle then hit him with that blast I knew this battle was going to be legendary
A Hero vs An Anti-Hero Two Types of Lich?  Amazing as always ahahaha
Fight is sick! but honestly the durability should give Alex the win.. cole is crazy strong but his lack of durability is just such a weakness when fighting someone as adaptive as Alex who already tanked a nuke.
I’m not watching this because it has to be Mercer, like I’m not even curious it just has to be.
God this was such a breath of fresh air. Maybe I'm biased, but this really felt like a blast from the past. A deathbattle showing both sides evenly matched, with an ending that makes sense, and the comments not a nuclear wasteland of fans arguing. Grew up on Prototype, and seeing Alex get dumpstered by something outside his powerset was satisfying.
im fine with this
Bio Leech for the WIN! Just because someone doesn't like to use a certain ability in good path for moral reasons, doesn't mean they WON'T if it's the only way to defeat a threat you KNOW is dangerous to you or those you're trying to protect. Honestly, I wish Hero Path Cole did use it some in certain boss fights to prove this point. While also showing his disgust at using it, making it clear it's a technique he would only use WHEN HE FEELS IT'S THE ONLY WAY HE CAN SURVIVE OR STOP A THREAT FROM HARMING OTHERS.  It'd make great character development as he struggles with certain aspects of his powers and why he prefers some techniques over others in his combat style.
Man i really wished aley would win
Before watching this, No F'ing way Alex Mercer is loosing this  Edit: After watching, that was BS
Im guessing prototype for the win Wow surprised
Man these soundtracks are trash
I was rooting for Alex, but Cole had real power
Eh dont care for this one tbh I know neither of these characters
Turns out Zero Punctuation was right in which he named the superior game.
Saw that coming a mile away.
Hire more staff or something... this is lazy work...  Why is 80% percent of the video pure commentary? We were drawn to this channel because of fighting, NOT commentary.  More epic battles and less talking 😢
Now we talking 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Serious Sam vs Duke Nukem
Amazing Fight animation!
Another good match up from the past.  I know this will never appear but I am bringing back The Mask fight and want him to fight Mary Poppins. Think she may have a chance to at least trick him to take it off lol. Be a weird scenario
Man if I gambled on Death Battles I would be broke
Cole Mcgrath was my first literally me character im so glad he won
Project Zeus vs Actual Zeus… The game was rigged from the start gentlemen
9:29
The dialogue is fire tho
Can you make kenpachi vs escanor next
would love to see delsin rowe in death battle
This was awesome,  would love to see a new Prototype game, a new Infamous with Cole would be great too. Video games are boring nowadays, these games had me hooked back then.
I like Alex MUCH more. And definitely not because we have the same name😁
RICK SANCHEZ VS STEWIE GRIFFIN. DO IT.
I dont understand how he lost there is literally no way to kill him but absorbtion lol this man literally runs around beating both infected and navy without really taking damage, he only has 2 fights where he actually gets hurt and he didnt  just beat them hut took over and decided to create more like him he said it himself he could have destroyed everything, tbh this is mismatch
After the next fight do Unicron vs Galactus please DeathBattle 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
now this is one ive always wanted to see
Two of the best games oat
Wait….frieza vs megatron?!? Really?!
Trevor Belmont vs Geralt of Rivia, please and thank you 😊
My God I've wanted this battle forever
BASED
Cole can control negawatts
Awesome.
Admiral Kizaru (One Piece) VS Minato Namikaze (Naruto)
PUH LEASE DO THE 1 BILLION LIONS vs EVERY POKEMON
I wouldve loved if cole got defeated but kessler came back
Ben 10 vs goku would be awesome
Cole was a fact a true hero
Please next battle is cyborg from teen titan vs crew members straw hat franky suuupperrrrrrrrr or beast boy from teen titan vs crew members straw hat tony tony chopper 🎉🎉🎉
God it felt so good to see my main man Cole back in spotlight 🎉
These franchises need a comeback. Even though InFamous 2 had the perfect ending. I would love to see another with Cole and see another Prototype game. Super fun games of PS3 and 360 era
15:25 Man, Cole powered up so hard his AMP rematerialized onto his back.
I remember a 12 year old me commenting a request for an Alex Mercer Vs Cole McGrath episode. I’m 24 now, and just as happy as I would be back then now that my 12 year old wish came true.
Fail. All Mercer had to do was touching him, and he's won. I guess you people don't know how a virus work.
rimuru v buu
Good match! Also… “whoo whooo whoooo” it’s lord frieza
The real Death Battle is Cole McGrath vs Sebastián Shaw
Damn, now i want an Infamous remake. Bluepoint games, lets go!
Sekiro vs tanjiro or SEKIRO vs Corporation hashiras
May you please do a video of Gojo Satorou vs Saitama
we need a new prototype with UE5 like right now
Cole story and pun intended, but he should have targeted the sick one by one instead of blowing himself up and making cole-lateral damage, jut like he did when fighting.
I think Cole can win against Alex by nuking him with an Ionic Thunder storm especially if there is thunderstorm. But Alex should've won in most cases because one of Alex ability is to transform. Why not have him kill Cole via silent assassination. One of the mechanics of the game is to have Alex infiltrate top security buildings via disguise. Maybe Cole can detect something wrong via his xray vision but could he catch-up before Alex killed him. Also, Alex can choose a better battlefield that Cole has a great disadvantage with. Without electricity around, Cole is powerless and why didn't Cole died after getting stabbed? Cole's strength also doesn't lie with his close quarter combat because he's faster with blasting people than hitting them. He should've lost the moment he chose to fight alex closer who can ravage tanks and copters in seconds upclose.
Frieza va megatron broke me💀💀💀💀💀💀
lool that wasn't even evil cole, he would have stomped him
I wanna see an alternate fight with evil Cole involved
I was excited to see this but then I remembered “oh yeah. Alex is weak to electricity.”
Okay but like Frieza-saga Frieza, the souped-up Cyborg(which IIRC is the strongest version of her in DBZ) or the umpteenth-upgrded Frieza that's probably irrelevant in Super right now? I seriously don't think either is a good matchup. Transformers comics have some messed up feats because that's what happens when writers have no sense of scale and cater to what looks good on the page(or screen). I don't doubt there are some obscure Megatron feats that stomp DBZ Frieza feats. But I _seriously_ doubt Megatron survives the might of a Frieza scaled to be relevant in the _post-Ultra Instinct_ world.
[SPOILER] 16:12 The Ending reminds me of Metal Gear Rising
Bro cole is should've trapped alex instead of draining him he could've gotten more good karma.
I might want to disagree with you but I just love both of these characters so much I am happy to see this.
imma act like i aint see megatron....
I’ve thought about this sorta fight years ago, tbh they need to create a continuation for both Cole and James heller
Frieza vs. Megatron is probably going to be one-sided, especially when Gold Frieza comes into play.
What about wiz vs boomstick
Your mom.
Cole played the Uno Reverse Card to turn the tables to take the win
now imagine if it was vampire Cole Lmao, Great game!
This is false in my opinion.  Firstly, if Alex could destroy buildings and the surrounding area, aka everything, how would cole recgarge his powers?  And its specifically said that Cole can only absorb bio-mass from people and conduit's, meaning Alex was completely safe from just about any kills cole could dish out.   Not only that, but when Cole was weak enough, he would have been absorbed on the spot, rather than it take a few seconds to actually work.   And I'm not saying this because i favor Alex, i like both of them and i respect that cole won, but i just have to point out the facts.
Muffin button!
C'mon mate don't be afraid of one piece episode lists.. It's time to create luffy vs somebody. Pleaseeee.. If not luffy any other mc from OP
I can agree
Havik vs. Deadpool is something that makes too much sense to not have happened yet.
Now the next one we will  be waiting for is delsin vs James heller
The first Prototype game was so much fun. The second one was alright but it just didn't have the impact I was hoping for. I do wish there was more support for the Prototype series though I thought it was cool. A remaster I'd get :)
The early 2000's was such a vibe
Wait how can someone who literally fights the us army an wins lose to someone who fights lowlife criminals. Alex tanks a nuclear explosion an lives. Also how can you be stab by a huge blade and be like I'm ok? Cole can't but Alex can this fight is a result of getting paid off by Sony or suckered punch.
Wow!
I was finna quit the if he went to some math bullsh!t
This is a video I expect to have been made like 14 years ago lmao
Kenshi (Mortal Kombat) vs. Daredevil (Marvel)    Run it up so they can SEE THIS ¡!!!!!!!!
Do a battle with the Emperor of Mankind from Warhammer 40K. 👀
I’d love to see another Battle Royale with the Mortal Kombat Ninjas, or at least the most popular ones
Awesome pasta
2 of my favorite games from the PS3 era. So happy Cole won.
i'd put 50k on Cole MacGrath, Bro is Literally Built Different
R.I.P Megatron
Day 1 of asking for Killua vs Kashimo
Who would be a good fight for Balthazar Czernenko from the game crackdown?
Epic
I remember for some reason when I was younger I thought these two games were in the same universe.
Two of my favorite games ever
Mr incredible vs Colossus next I been asking for years
Do patrick vs superman
I genuinely don't get where they got it from that Cole has ANY physical feats above Alex. Also, Alex should be so much more skilled relatively speaking.
What a great fight scene 🔥
Has death battle ever featured kratos
Stewie vs Dexter from Dexter's lab.
Here's a death battle... world breaker hulk vs Justice lord's Superman!!! Let's go supes!!!
Who voiced Cole McGrath in this?
Alex using his armor hits different when he doesnt use it on prototype2.
Linkin park type music in the back is perfect
Frieza versus a robot 😒
I only know who cole is because of PlayStation all star battle Royale and Alex idk so Cole.
I SAID MEGATRON VS. VILGAX NOT MEGATRON VS. FRIEZA!!!!
I love both series equally, so I wouldn't mind if either of these characters won. Although, this probably one of the few times that I will watch or enjoy a death battle for a long time since they've fallen off for the most part imho and I liked most of the older battles.
Idea for next death battle. Wild krafts brother vs beast boy
If this is respect Cole he wouldn't use bio leech since it's gives evil karma. In a playthrough you use restraining. Yeah Batman can technically use his claw and ram it down someone's eye but that's not Batman.
Do ms pickels vs karl(lhamas w hats)
I'm just gonna leave this comment here at the beginning of the video. I've played both prototypes and all 3 of the infamous games and while second son was eh, i LOVED the rest. And yeah there's no way Cole is gonna win this. Alex is simply too damn durable, literally being able to regenerate from a puddle of blood and yes while Cole is also very durable, he is not gonna survive being cut in half
if they don't give Frieza his 'Black Frieza" form, something's amiss.
All We've Ever Asked For Is One Death Battle... Been Asking Since Season One... Please Consider...  Doctor WHO and The TARDIS Vs Mr. Peabody And The WABAC Machine Vs Professor Frizzle And The Magic School Bus!  The Ultimate Battle Royale Through Time And Space!
So here me out kibutsuji Muzan vs Alex Mercer
I hope they make another infamous. What a great series
negative
Sheesh , so Its not only me that Alex has some villain or anti hero persona. Heck , even in the sequel he IS the villain.
Do you think Second Son's protag would be able to copy the abilities of Mercer?
For the next fight lets do an MMA fighter vs. kid in a wheel chair! Same energy!
Why bot put this in death battle, The entire army of Decepticon vs Turn A Gundam?
I got a weird random suggestion, what if you guys did community death battles for fights you’ve already done before that are a bit outdated now.  Instead of doing an entire DB episode for a rematch, we could just have a discussion about it.   Personally I’ve always wanted to see a rematch between Vergil and Sephiroth. Vergil’s gotten a lot stronger in DMC5 and Sephiroth might change a lot in the new FF7 games.   I thought it’d be fun to see how this and other match ups have changed over the years.
If both of these games came from the late 2000's can you hire some people who knew music from that time frame? i swear this fight had music that screamed out "Gen Z new trash" your stuff needs more grit and metal to match Infamous and Prototype.
Dee Dee vs. Morty (dexter’s laboratory vs. Rick & Morty)
Vergil vs Zoro!
Saitama vs Superman Goku vs Sentry Bardock vs Minato Harley Quinn vs Juliet Starling Jack the Ripper(Record of Ragnarok) vs The Joker Kurumi Tokisaki vs Reverse Flash Dio vs Hit Broly vs Asura Goku Black vs Régimen Superman
This video healed my inner child
Wait I thought mercer was immune to fire and electricity so why was he in pain when Cole shocked him ??
This was probably my personally most wanted Death Battle to happen for almost a decade, and I'm happy it finally became a reality.
After watching this, kinda want to see a prototype remaster to play for me.
It took me a while to find the words to describe this  First, I'm not into either franchise. I'm only know about Prototype from a friend, and Infamous from Vs. Forums  Still, I have to admit this is a pretty impressive episode. Making it intentionally dated was a bold move, but I think it pays off in the end, as the the episode has more of an identity rather than just "the most voted 3D match-up."  As for the battle, my congratulations to the animation team. Not only they delivered with the spectacle, they also managed to solve some of the issues with both choreography and breakable environment. It hit that nostalgia bone for older 3D episodes that I didn't even know I had  The analysis was pretty decent going by the knowledge I had on both characters. But, even if I agree with the verdict, I felt some pretty juicy stuff didn't make it to the episode  Overall, a 9.5/10 episode for me
As a fan of both franchises I’m glad this death battle finally happened. I prefer Cole but I thought he would lose to Alex based on how hard Alex is to put down permanently but I’m glad I was wrong. Thinking about it the beast would also be able to destroy Alex and maybe Kessler as well.
Hey I would like to see which blade or the darkness featured in this I've been waiting so long I retrofitted a bunch of different sprites to make a witchblade sprite allong time ago and i always felt she and the darkness dont get enough rep
Well we know who wins the next death battle
I want to see your Father Day gifts discord
I've played both and I feel like Mercer should have won but death battles have sucked for a long time now for me anyway meh lol 🤣
Luffy vs Naruto
Preparo xxl en el fútbol español
Awesome fight but don't agree.  Alex wins this fight
Cole FTW. EZ. Bring back Infamous!
Azz
We need a wiz vs boomstick death battle
You made a lot of once-13 year old boys happy with this one
Blade vs Buffy (Vampire hunter vs vampire hunter)
We need a fight between The Big O and The Iron Giant
My Matchup: Infinite Vs Doll (Sonic the hedgehog/Sega Vs Murder Drones/Glitch Productions)  Connections: Zero’s jackal squad was killed by shadow the hedgehog than he calls him weak and becomes infinite. Doll’s parents were destroyed by V then doll will get her revenge on V that she destroyed her parents.
I wish the first infamous was remastered.
Nice.
2:15 I'm sorry, read your mind like what?
I what’s the idea of doing a tournament style, death battle season
Dexter from Dexter's laboratory vs Jimmy neutron what y'all think?
Weird result considering back then both fanbases agreed that Alex would beat Cole pretty solidly since the general consensus was that Alex could take and dish damage while Cole could dish a bit more damage than Mercer but couldn't take even remotely close to the damage that Alex could take and do, so it was a matter of how long would it take for Mercer to land a fatal blow like at 15:51, but then again this was before Prototype 2 ruined Mercer's character.  Still that is some sick fight.
Naw I’m good
Now cole macgrath vs galen marek (starkiller) death battle now 😊
Damn, i miss prototype
Boom stick going off this ep
What title flashbacks... which actually makes me think why hasn't there been a Death Battle of HALO VS STARCRAFT, The Arbiter vs Artanis?
In the good ending from Imfamous is a short scene to Cole could have survived.
I WAS CONVINCED AFTER STATS THAT COLE WAS GONNA LOSE. This is a goated death battle and early 2000s kid’s dream battle.
I like  the  background music  who was the  artist
Random ADD moment, but I have a sudden matchup idea that I think would be pretty awesome.  If only for the combinations of iconic looks.  Striga from the Castlevania animated series, in her kickass day-armour.  Versus Artorias of Astora in his corrupted dark armor.  His greatshield and sword versus her greatsword.  Though by the end Artorias likely being driven at the very least to his storied state of shed shield, broken arm, and left-handed summersaulting powered up glory.  No matter who lost that fight, we'd all win on the spectacle.  Besides.  Their dear companions could get in on the fun.  Great grey wolf Sif adding strength to Artorias' side while Morana adds tactics/brains to Striga's corner.
On this note of Infamous, I'd love to see Delsin versus John from Unordinary, or some other equally matched power stealing guy. I can't think of one off the bat, but I think it'll be cool.
I thought Cole would go back in time time like Kessler and kill alex in the past, since Alex would continue to evolve in any hostile environment.
Need Biscuit Oliva (Baki) Vs Takeshi Wakatsuki or Julius Reinhold (Kengan Ashura)
Delson Rowe v James Heller better b in the making
FF14 Warrior of light vs PSO 2 Guardian
There’s always something satisfying to me about a true good guy managing to overpower a normally unstoppable villain.
Could y’all do a death battle between V of Cyberpunk and Adam Jensen from Deus Ex Machina?
Prototype is such a fun game, highly recommend
This is the first death battle since yoda v king Mickey that actually interested me, characteristically
Make AKUMA vs YUJIRO or baki verse vs kengnan ashura verse!!! Please!
Dude I've spent a decade on solemn resignation that Alex Mercer would beat Cole in a fight, so this was a cool surprise
Is it just me or does it seem like they come out with new videos every month or so now as before where it was almost every week
Super random but luffy vs Hoopa unbound
Freeza vs Megatron? That seems like a no-contest. There's no way Megatron is on the level of a character who can match Multiverse destroyers.
growing up, the original infamous was the first game which made me wanna buy a ps3. seeing it given such love after all these years makes the kid in me happy. great video
YYYEESSSSS !!!! Cole you ARE MAN ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡
Ive wanted to seen both lf them square off since both of these games were big in my childhoo
Can you make a deathbattle with roy mustang?
15:50 is a beautiful scene.
ever thought about V vs Adam Jensen? (cyberpunk vs deus ex)
"That's right, Boomstick" They actually did it!!!
Coke vs Alex > Bill vs Discord
I love how the violins joined at 15:21 just like the InFamous themes
I am simply begging for a final fantasy style remake of infamous and prototype
Andrew (Chronicles) VS Eleven (Stranger Things)
Can we just talk about the last seconds of the video . I mean we got frieza vs megatron who get annouced . This is clearly a main event .
man i wish death battle made a fight between astro bot(one of playstations mascot's) and sack boy (a little cloth doll that is a plastation mascot)
0:30 "Wait, we haven't emptied our trash in 10 years?" Shows how little they throw away. Good on you for recycling.  You are recycling, right?
13:07  ^ Love playing these classic games to this day, never gets old❕🤌🏼
Cole is such a chad he had to save humanity from a plague a second time.
Wesker Vs Alex Mercer would be a more comparable fight
Damn, I can't believe the InFamous Cole McGrath defeated Alex Prototype Mercer. You could say this fight was inhuman eh?                I'll see myself out
That was sick
I would like to see Graboid (Tremors) in death battle against someone like Pederator.
Y'all have no idea how much we NEEDED this
We need bugs bunny in a death battle against like maybe Deadpool or something
THIS IS ALL IVE EVER WANTED
Soldier boy vs captain america who would win?🤔
get rid of the wack ass song in the background and it would be a decent fight.
Smol brain: *makes a whole video using power scaling to explain how Cole wins*  Big brain: “Cole got range”
I’m mad we never got a Prototype 3 that opens with a new Blacklight Alex growing and tearing itself out of James
John Wick vs. Transporter
Alex is the virus himself, you can't say he died until all lifeform is dead, anyone can be infected without them knowing.
NEXT! CASTLEVANIA DRACULA VS. HELLSING ALUCARD!
COLE MERCER VS DELSIN PLEASE INFAMOUS 1&2 VS INFAMOUS SECOND SOM
As I thought victory came down to who sucks worse.
I like this. Thank you
Alex: and then he said "good idea"  Ben: first time?
These videos r the best but u should probably do more on video game characters then anime characters
The most durable I've ever seen cole lmao dude is dead if he gets stabbed by a blade of that size
Superior character wins
So we're getting Heller vs Delsin down the road, right guys?
Nah this cap
Finally, two of my favourite video game characters. THANK YOU.
Sorry but the ray sphere can't be used as a feat it didn't do anything to coles best friend when he tried to get powers and he detonated it on purpose also it only killed people who didn't have the conduit gene so it had nothing to do with durability cole is strong but considering that Alex has the ability to infect and absorb abilities from people without killing them there is very little chance cole would have been able to win
I really want Prototype to continue the story of Elizabeth Greene’s child, PARIAH, since Radical Entertainment admit he’s stronger then both Heller and Mercer, and the game engines of Spider-Man would be perfect for Prototype
SPOILER: The white guy whose last name starts with M won.
Alex was still alive after prototype 2, they were supposed to make a part 3 showing that he set up that final fight and watched it from the roof tops just to make a stronger soldier
Frieza vs Megatron? Time for Dragonball to lose again.
This is just another L from death battle.....alex would've killed him hundreds of times over before the first 10 seconds
Moraz Miss versus voldemort please Team fortress 2 versus Harry Potter
Dragon Ball Super; Toppo VS. Seven Deadly Sins; Escanor
Pretty sure Mercer should have won but nice to see cole pull the upset
THE BATTLE REMINDS ME OF GUTS VS DIMITHRI :)
I didn’t play infamous I watched playthroughs on YouTube old YouTube I miss those days but I had prototype it was amazing so much fun !!
I grew up on these games, seeing these two duke it out like everyone did in online forums back in 2000s is AMAZING. The fight scene was top-tier, like out of a superhero movie and I'm giving the biggest Chef's Kiss for this.  Thanks DB for an amazing video that brought me back to my childhood with my favorite video-game superhero + supervillain!
Imma be honest. I didn't expect Cole to win and might not think he actually can either.  But who cares? It was a cool fight and the good guy won.
Ik DB was cooking this from mile a way. And they served Alex justice even tho he couldn't win. The one in Prototype 2 with heller is just plot armor bro
The fight that we all wanted since 2015
did they copy that one part where Kratos and Thor where fighting in the mid air 15.43
As a fan of both games, I can say that Alex Mercer should have won (low diff). Alex has the advantage in strength, speed, durability, intelligence, regeneration and has a greater variety of destructive powers. Cole is powerful but physically he is not powerful enough to withstand Alex's blows.
Mmm how bout, a death battle between Whiz and Boomstick?☝️😅
Uh, Cole wouldn't have used his absorb power, as that gives him negative karma and is out of character for him to use when operating the canonical good guy route.  I call foul! Misplay! MISPLAY!  (mostly jk, still a great fight overall, and happy to see both these characters and series in action again 🙂)
PlayStation employee
Feel like Dark sector should have been involved.
little mac vs Ippo
This Death Battle was a fun waltz through childhood.  Next Death Battle is an unabashed curb stomp
Frieza vs Megatron? That seems insanely one sided
Both these franchise were gold. Prototype was the embodiment of linkin Park three days grace and Rockstar energy and I loved it.
Shouldn't Cole's electricity disrupt Mercer's constructs? Like molecular destabilization, cuz he's just a clump of cells and the current should disrupt the flow of his cells.
I REALLY WISH Infamous  would be available on steam. I have been wanting to play that game for the longest time
better late than never
Pls do a yujiro hanma VS kaido
I’ve been waiting for this ever since I was a young kid 😎
Faz Bill Cipher vs The Collector
Alex Mercer should win
Some fight were unfair for example scout vs tracer because tracer have some sort of supernatual power and scout is just a human
13 years you guys have been at this. And for 13 years, I've been requesting Conan The Barbarian vs Tarzan Of The Apes.
Boruto vs Rey Mysterio wwe
Hmm, was expecting Mercer to win this. Also wasn't expecting them to use Prototype 2's personality for Mercer.
Should’ve been Cole McGrath Vs Starkiller.  Cole deserved a far better opponent.   Cole, a being of incredible ability. Shat on him like a bird in the sky. Yet left to ultimately choose for himself his own affinity. His powers weren’t just Bio-Electricity. His greatest strength was his ability to manipulate his very own destiny.   Star-Killer. Oh boy!!! Is the definition of OP. Right out the gate.  The Bull just doesn’t kick the rider, but takes the audience through a  “Force driven” “Electro/telekinetic” nightmare all while Gallen screaming and freaking out the whole time.   The strength Cole has is not only exasperated by, but fueled from Gallen Merricks inability to lay a finger on his own destiny. No matter how powerful Star-Killer is. He will always be another’s puppet. His destiny, a finger he cannot, even touch. Whether “The Player”, Vader, The Emperor, the rebellion , that no name female support character, and/or/ together The Force Itself will always manipulate Gallens inevitable demise. Torturously.   Both incredible games!!! Prototype 2 on its hardest difficulty was a controller destroying epoch come the end with Alex.   I’ve been clamoring Cole Vs. Star-Killer for years. Happy to see Coles appearance, but this was the fight they both deserved.  Lastly Deathbattle. It’s cool you didn’t mention. But Cole can time-travel/timeline-jump.
Lara Croft vs Katniss Everdeen (Tomb Raider vs Hunger Games)
MegaMan vs EonKid🤝🏽
i feel like they gave Good Cole a bit too much credit here. Evil Cole would've 100% wiped the floor with Mercer, but Good Cole has limitations to his power
The Phantom (from the Defenders) vs Bravestar
I got a question, Alex is an evolver that adapts by consuming biomass. So if he consumed Cole, will he get his powers ? If so he'd be the ultimate being by just having the dna of his opponent, so getting a bit of wolverine blood or someone that have immortality or insensibility, he's be god ?
Really?! Frieza is gonna win lol
holy piss… another MacGrath… i never see any other Macs only Mc’s… good to see my last name gettin some use even if it’s in fiction 😂
Mercer almost fricken had him. But infamous guy was so much powerfuk
Cole can also recharge directly from a thunder storm. He’s done it before in the mission “The Storm” where he was literally calling down lightning from the sky to recharge himself.
Day one of asking for Adam smasher in death battle
Batlle of the sequels, infamous 2 vs prototype 2
Cole McGrath kills Alex Mercer and saves the world from his tyranny
If Cole was fully charged at the beginning, Cole would end the fight faster
Alex was better in them games, though
i grew up playing both games, and i had more attachment to cole but i was honestly expecting mercer to win. then cole surprised me and i was still pretty happy with that, since i played infamous first with my older brother
The three Guardian classes winner take all
this is epic
Its been so long.
It's a sickness not the same as a conduit Alex is the virus which is why it TAKES THE FORM OF A PERSON BECAUSE IT LATCHED TO HIS BODY he's the only one that can control it Cole should be a diseased mutated pile of flesh and infect everything
I thought Alex was gonna win even though I was rooting for Cole. Glad to be wrong about this.
Megatron vs freiza is gonna be fire but an character that LONG overdo for an episode is hit from dragon ball super! the fight would be SICK and the kills would be BRUTAL
One question? Why hasn't Monkey D. Luffy got a death battle yet?
I haven't played either of these games, but holy crap this fight was sick! This was a better superhero fight than anything Marvel and DC have given us for a long time.  Now if you will excuse me, I need to go and track down copies of Infamous and Prototype.  EDIT: So I have managed to get myself copies of both games, and both are fantastic! I like the overall gameplay of Prototype more, but Infamous nails the feeling of playing as a superhero (there's also a lot of obvious influences from the developers work on the Sly Cooper series, which was cool to see).
Because of this video I remember the Infamous comics.  In those comics Cole fought a guy with an insane regeneration
Doubt anyone else came to this idea but... Lucy the Diclonius Queen vs Alex Mercer would be a dope fight
From a die hard infamous fan thank sooo much for using infamous one Cole voice well using infamous 2 Cole 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🥹🥲
As an inFAMOUS fan this made me so happy, waiting 10 years was totally worth it. Cole and Alex were legends in the PS3/360 era of gaming and seeing the result just made me even more happy. God I wish inFAMOUS and Prototype got another chance to be relevant again they just brought a different vibe compared to other open-world sandbox games.
Shinmon Benimaru vs Satoru Gojo
As much as this was asked for from the fans it sure was less than 20 minutes
Alright but that teaser tho. Really curious how theyre gonna justify Megatron having a chance against Frieza when they said Starscream loses to Rainbow Dash
Didn't we already figure this out with Yahtzees paintings?
Excellent animation wish most battles were created using this program.
I know they hate the script but Linkin Park Kirby was pure gold.
YESSSSSS I LOVED BOTH OF THESE GAMES SOOOO MUCH
Por favor pode fazer a luta de kokushibo Full Power vs Kenshin
You're joking on the next fight right? There is no way Megatron can take on Frieza
Very action-packed.
dude how did cole win? mercer fking stabbed through him.
Alex: YOU DON’T WANT TO GIVE ME YOUR POWER?!? FINE! I’LL JUST TAKE IT!  Cole: Taking powers, huh? Thanks for the tip.
Yo who really wants to see these two series rebooted?
I word like to see a ghost rider vs Jonah Hex death battle
The call back to goku’s “muffin buttin” from dbza is amazing
Sand-Man vs Clayface  Lizard-Man vs Killer Crock  Tommy Vercetti vs Tony Montana
How can Megatron even stand up to Frieza?
WHEN EZIO AUDITORE???
Bro got turned into ace but still won???  I feel like they buffed his healing factor
I think Cole would have Zoned him out. Maybe???
Don't forget about the guy from Psi Ops!
I was rooting for cole lowkey
Dammit, I'm really really happy with the result, but I honestly thought Alex would have taken Cole out quickly. I never factored in the atomic vs. Molecular thing. This is a really great episode
Frieza vs Megatron
Delson vs James??????
Bro who here knows allot about tron bc bro I feel like there bullying him
What was that clip that showed cole zapping Nathan drake?
Better songs please? It feels like we’ll you know
Ima keep it simple: it was badass and it went exactly how I thought it would. I loved this❤❤
I was rooting for Cole, but saw the thing about Alex respawning from even the smallest of tissues.    Fight was intense.  And great.
Huh? Welcome to the top of the food chain.
Thor vs aquaman
Yea booy
Bradon went all out for this score, really gotta channel the Linkin Park 2000s vibes
This went way too hard for a fight between characters that haven’t had a game in years
Now I have to know who'd win Delsin Rowe V.S. James Heller
This is so wrong bro
I was just starting junior high school when these games came out. Since that era of gaming was top-notch, this was the matchup I didn't know I needed!
Saw thumb nail and thought it was Galen Marek but it's someone else got dupped unintentionally. Should read instead assuming something.
hello fresh has Sponder'd them for the past 10yrs bro
Finally after all this years...
I am a huge fan of both Infamous and Prototype games, this was one battle I thought would end differently. Still a great episode.
I knew this fight was gonna be good from the moment when Cole did the electric slide on a infectious tendril of death ❤
These two feel like they should be in the same universe.
Alex's main thing is espionage and they never used that what!! that's half the game!! he would have ran away killed Zeke, turned into Zeke have a beer with Cole and then assassinate him with his back turned😂😂😂
They NEEEEEEED to remake each of these games holy damn
The battle of who’s more Shadow the hedgehog
They need to do a video on scissor seven
venom vs static shock
This maybe dumb but what if they did second son against prototype 2.
The battle everyone wanted since both these games first came out
I feel like i've been waiting for this fight ever since i bought my PS3. Somehow, here it also feels like Alex has more dialogue than in his main debut.
Naruto vs meliodas.
This was always something that crossed my mind when the games were out. Love to see this
I was never that into Prototype since Infamous had me in a choke hold. I thaught Alex was going to win based on his regeneration powers and that Cole couldnt heal himself since i forgot he can drain to heal
Trevor Philips wins he is the winner PLS
Max steel vs generation Rex
Feel like Alex should have won just because of the amount of punishment he could take and dish out in the games cole could hardly take on 50 armed men all at once and a tank would been like a mini boss fight to him
Infamous second son would be fyee
Gosh I love the power sets on both of these characters.
I’m honestly so happy with the outcome since inFamous was one of my top 10 favorite series.
Love that feeling of being able to make some money off a ten year old project that went nowhere at the time.
It’s interesting how similar their stories are.  - both origins of the bio attacks were caused by them - both end up as wanted criminals - both have to fight mutated creatures - both can use their powers to hover - see the memories of other people - their personalities seem a bit similar too - both can drain power from other people  I feel like there’s others but that’s it so far.
i really wanted to see a new prototype game or even a remake of the first one
GOKU VS SAITAMA
I been waiting for this for years
I’ve been asking for this since the first time I watched Death Battle!
Why did you assume a viral mass has bio-electricity?
For the next Death Battle, please do Baraka (Mortal Kombat) vs Wolverine (X-Men)
So prediction for the next death battle, It's Frieza for sure right? he's able to withstand destroyer Ki which erases things from existence, and he is fully capable of incinerating planets. I haven't kept up with Transformers, and while they do have world destroying weapons, i don't personally recall anything that would feasibly pass that bar. Still, it'll be a good fight even if i am wrong so, see you all then.
i have been waiting for this fight for god knows how long  edit: i own inFAMOUS 1 and 2 and the vampire dlc and second son (not first light tho), and i own Prototype 1 and 2
Bra..i uavent even seen the fight yet but this Alex guy got some crazy power going on
Please do spawn v ghost rider
Like Dr. Robotnik, Cole McGrath can smell the electricity in your brain.
Hands down one of the best episode and it just makes me wish 4 a new infamous and prototype game. İncredible match up with incredible characters.
Man, I remember playing prototype (first and second). It was a edgy and badass game that makes you feel like if you were a anti-hero. Hope they would remake it for new gen
I love how alex is basically a final boss with his phase 2 armour
Next death battle. Would Frieza take that hard? Does megatron actually have some wild crazy feats?
This seems heavily in Alexs favor
Y’all should do one with ghost rider or spawn
"Even though Cole is a hero he gave no mercy for Mercer" this would of been a nice ending too
Ok but imagine a game with these two where u pick the one you want to play as at the start and fight against the other
For once I agree with death battle but we all know that good cole is nerfed cole, and evil cole has no restraint, that battle would’ve been bigger and more destructive. And that’s without the powers of the beast
Aw man… I really wanted Alex to win, I kindof enjoyed his powers abit more still an epic fight tbh
Please do Chrollo Lucilfer (hunter hunter) vs Pain (Naruto ) or phantom troupe vs Akatsuki
Atrocitus Vs Hulk (DC vs Marvel) that would be a pretty good match up
Im happy with this fight
Can you do Escanor or any other character from the seven deadly sins please 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT FRIEZA VS MEGATRON?!?!?!!?
Ok to everyone thats saying of course Cole would win I would like to say please go to the wiki and read because death battle does not do proper math they fly by the rule of cool here is how i can prove it Alex Mercer survived a nuke designed to wipe out all of new York and Cole McGrath barely survived a bomb that wiped out half a city block and no Alex would not die from having his cells burned what do you think the nuke did it left him as a chard corpse and he still came back Cole on the other hand would get infected the moment he came into close quarters combat evidence he gets turned into a vampire in one of the dlc meaning he is still susceptible to diseases so the fact Alex lost despite the fact he should have had every advantage was stupid entertaining but stupid
"Read your mind like Goku's muffin button" if you know you know🤣 2:13
Never thought I'd see the day this battle happened
Wonder Woman (DC) vs Dante (Devil my cry) would be an interesting fight
Heller beat Mercer only through absorption, and it can be argued Mercer isn't technically dead since he's just a sentient virus who now lives within Heller.  Afterall, he regenerated fully with his memories even when he was just a speck of flesh with no brain matter.  Only way to fully kill him is destroy all of his cells and if a nuke didn't do it, then I can't imagine Cole could.   Weird to suggest Cole can withstand atomic disintegrating because of the sphere blast, which by that logic he should be totally invincible.  Beast Cole on the other hand...
Mercer let Heller win, it's pretty obvious.
Did they made a Goku's muffin botten reference
now they should do delsin rowe vs james heller
It's still fresh in my memories how I turn mercer into pulp with heller
This was insane!  I was hyped the whole fight!  Cheese us. Y’all never disappoint
Maybe I just don’t know enough on the Transformers lore, but I’m thinking Frieza should beat Megatron without much trouble. Hell, Frieza’s weakest form was able to casually blow up planets. 🤷‍♂️
This tickles my nostalgia bone just right
Can yall do a video of spawn vs cosmic ghostrider?
Ok no offense but I feel like frieza could easily take out megatron
Wait Alex is the black light virus. The virus and that one ability that woman has are much different and you can't determine he'd be immune based on that. In prototype 2 Alex was able to turn himself into a virus bomb and made manhattan into the red zone. I don't see why Alex can't  overwhelm Cole's immune system and eat him from the inside out.
now prophet from crysis vs master chief from halo
Do not bs me bro Alex would easily have just absorbed him from jump
This would have been a crazy death battle 10 years ago
One day I'll be able to finish a death battle video without buffering... that will be a good day.
Mercer, Alex J. AKA Blacklight AKA Zeus; gets defeated by a lightning boy. The irony. Can we have a fight between scifi chosen ones that turn evil? Darth Vader the former jedi that became a sith lord vs Horus Lupercal from Warhammer 40k, the warmaster of the great crusade corrupted into a champion of chaos undivided.
Woah now we are talking !
Rap 🤮
Lightning. Didn't remember how it beats Viral freaks any day. I should remember it's hotter than the sun and just as hot as a white dwarf star. Nothing survives being exposed to it's radiation.
imagine a conduit with the blacklight virus...
Mr. Fantastic vs Monkey D Luffy
How about darth sidious vs frieza
Best DB in a while.
please god i hope this gives prototype 3
Merlin from “sword of the stone” by Disney. Vs any modern wizard
Request deathbattle:  Shinra (fireforce) vs Beerus (DB super) or Ywach (Bleach)
I was hoping for evil cole 😅
It would been so amazing if it was Thor versus Cole McGrath now that's a fight because Thor can't absorb lightning which is crazy cuz he's a lightning god so he should so I thought he should be able to observe lightning but he can't
Freeza vs Megatron? What can Megatron do to match Freeza?
But regardless the video is all the other ones was still the best
@deathbattle hear me out on this one ok. For your next video, you should do the Elites from halo vs The Yautja a.k.a predators. Think about it, 2 honorable warrior societies, who have both been influenced/encountered far higher species they believe to be gods. *Forerunners/Engineers* They also find hand to hand combat the most honorable form of combat.   They are both raised from basically birth to be warriors and both have advanced tech *plasma/Lasers* Finally, they have both fought against humanity at some point so they are even more relatable to one another. They also would both choose death over dishonor.
I've been waiting for this SINCE THEY BOTH DEBUTED!  YEARS AGO! THANK YOU
Lol Cole dies from bullets alone wtf. Alex tanks tanks and nukes dafuq is this deathbattle?
Bro imagine Luffy gear 5 vs the mask
Good fight.   Please stop with the super heroes fight, yall tiring with that
now we need doomslayer to reapear
actually the weakness of the blacklight virus is the anti virus whitelight   delsin rowe vs James Heller would be awesome too
It feels like I have been thinking about this fight for years
Best 1 so far
This was a good 1
I knew some1 was getting absorbed lol
I vote for Megatron to win.
did he say "Goku's muffin button"? TFS is still alive
The animation was epic
Man this the ONE!
Does anyone know the song?
Obviously infamous will get another game but sucker punch wanted to make other games like G.O.S a d take a break.. Hopefully prototype gets something great.. always hoped to get something similar to its cgi graphical scenes and move closer to how infamous games went in terms of graphical environment... isnt this battle kinda late ahaha cool tho since it will bring attention to these games..alex should have won. Him shapeshifting into like a hurt civilian then cole going to him to help while alex impales him with the win...cole shouldn't survive a impale like that haha come on... alex is smarter and cant die
So whether it be a contest of wearing women's underwear or a battle to the death, Cole Wins either way...I mean technically Alex won, but that was because the companies switched characters for that one, with Sucker Punch doing Alex in a bra and Radical doing Cole, and quite a good job they both did too...yes, that was a real contest both teams decided to participate in. The unicorns decided the victor in that one.
Hello, new favorite Death Battle. Seriously, this is a matchup I’ve dreamed of since middle school, and you guys did NOT disappoint. Stay awesome, guys!
FRIEZA VS MEGATRON WTF IS LIFE
FINALLY A FIGHT I'VE BEEN DYING TO SEE!!!
Frieza vs megatron....a metal man that is vulnerable to...bullets...and a casual Universe destroyer. On a multiversal level. Thats gonna be a lame one.
Denji Vs Yuji PLEASE Kakashi Vs Gojo PLEASE Gon Vs Yusuke PLEASE
I was rooting for Cole, and I was not disappointed in the fight. Oh yeah!
Yo that was brutal and super entertaining
Booooooo
Indiana Jones vs Rick O’ Connell?
played both loved cole more
Now the only thing we need to complete the roster death battles I've wanted since childhood, Jake Long the American Dragon versus Danny Phantom. Make it happen boys please!
Ehh Prototype still the far better game.
Okay, I only played the winner's game, but I thought he was gonna lose!
How about wiz vs broomstick
Bro I thought Alex was God
Kinda felt like they over did cole a bit. Not saying he aint strong but so of the stuff is a bit exaggerated.
You better hope he didn't discard a limb somewhere.
The best Infamous vs Prototype match has already been made by Yathzee from "Zero Punctuation" in his videos and on his blog.
Love Prototype 2 😍 my first game to have 100% trophys
Man do i need to see Nero from Devil May Cry in one of these death battles😢😢
Awesome video, I'm beyond elated that Mercer finally got a death battle, not so thrilled that he was outclassed, but facts are facts. Loved the fight either way
I love how you mentioned evil cole.
Your animators are always amazing. Who are they?
It’s so cool to see them use Cole’s Giga blades from the first infamous game
The muffin button comment is hilarious.
The scarab vs blue beetle
We need a fist fight🤜🏽🤛🏽 baki 🤜🏽vs🤛🏽 ohma tokita  It would be lit 🔥
Day one of asking for Gojo vs Bill Cypher
I still think alex wouldve won even with coles ability to heal hes still technically human so him being stabbed through the chest should've killed or damn near killed him. Just because he's super human doesn't mean he had the durability so i think alex shouldve won but alas can't change it now
When I saw the title, I knew who the writers would have win. They’re so unbelievably predictable. Another massive disagreement.
alex you don't want give me your power. (laughs maniacally) fine, I'll just take it! cole powers up good idea! (alex screams before impact and fallen to death by cole's power might + after spark soul steal × thus, alex's death defying defeat) cole the world sure isn't perfect but it is better without you, a**hole. a perfection finale for both character quotes! loved it right before the win results!❤🎉
1.8k infamous haters and/or prototype stans in the dislikes seething rn
I still don't know who any of these guys are but I was originally thinking the emo guy was gonna win but found myself cheering the electrode guy from the middle to the end.
Thsi was amazing! Hopefully there will be an alternate ending for this
Rock lee and Baki
This caught me off guard I saw this on my line up and I LOVE both of these dues they were my childhood lol such great times with these beasts of men
Bruh... Freezer vs Megatron. Hydrogen Bomba vs Couhing baby
Richter Belmont vs Geralt of Rivia
I really would like to see a return to the Cole version of Infamous.  I had nothing against Second Son, it was actually a great game, but Cole just felt more enjoyable.  At the end of Infamous 2 there was that last second lightning bolt... Imagine if he was dormant all that time and an old man version of Delsin Rowe discovers him, revealing some kind of new enemy that has been hunting down conduits.    Cole, drained of most of his previous powers steps up to fight this new threat with old man Delsin as his mentor in a new era.
Finally the debate my cousin and I have been beefing over is finally done
I would really like to see a death battle where someone was in spartan armor from halo and then power armor from fall out
Beatrix (Kill Bill) vs John Wick please!!
I can't believe It I FINALLY found a death battle that I like MORE THAN Dante vs bayonetta. and samurai jack vs afro samurai. Dante vs bayonetta was my favorite. And samurai jack vs afro samurai was my second but now Dante vs bayonetta is my second favorite and samurai jack vs afro samurai is my third. and my NEW ALL TIME FAVORITE IS  cole macgrath vs alex mercer. This was my dream match so literally the beginning
Me wanting a Dante from Dev I mean LIMBUS COMPANY vs Doctor from Arknights!
wait until Delsin Rowe pulls up
Cole is op
YOU CANT STOP THE GOAT!
Anyone else notice the title says vs instead of the capitalized VS?
NOW DO THEIR SQUELS PLEASE
What’s the song called
I’m so happy this is just now coming out I loved infamous so much as a kid it was everything I wanted in a game, ability to choose evil or good, comic books and a badass main character, Open world with dope side characters! With prototype I only loved Alex’s look, abilities and edginess lol still a cool game though
Plot armor saved Cole
Alex should have won. This guy can throw a garbagetruck 800 feet and has no stamina limit. Cole can do the same, theoretically, but it takes alot of prep and he looses energy. Alex would rip him apart.
Who else here wants to see Carnage fight Alex Mercer?
I think the only way it'd make sense for Alex to win is if he manages to absorb enough of Cole to start gaining Conduit powers but I don't think he'd figure out how to use them well enough in time to survive.  The key(for Alex) would be to be able to counter-drain Cole to prevent him from disintegrating him, if he could manage that I think it'd be game over simply because Cole wouldn't be able to overcome Alex's sustainability whilst draining bio-electricity AND consuming with Blacklight.
I personally choose to believe in prototype series, that Alex Mercer CHOSE to have the new MC kill him in the sequel.  Just because he felt like he was less of a hero.
Cole is the goat 🤟🤟🤟🫶 rest in peace bro
Infamous  still is one of my favorite games really wish they would continue to series
Hey death battle, can we yell about a react-creator putting SPOILERS:          "He can regenerate and still lost!?" As his YouTube title. I was about to watch THIS when his video popped up in recommendeds. Spoiling it for me.
Wolverine versus scarecrow versus Freddy Krueger
Would love to see Infamous make a big return, especially wouldn't mind seeing Cole come back to the series.
Nice animation! Shame i dont know who they are and never played the games.
Imagine eating so many people you turn into a dmc character
Feel like bio leech win is a stretch considering how Alex’s biology works but ok. And I know Cole can heal but this like the Dio fight against. Alex should have torn him apart the moment he stabbed especially when he impaled Cole.
Didnt expect the ending and I had my favorite for sure after waiting for so long for this fight but glad we got it in the end.
Can we have Roger vs bender
Awesome battle
Do Pac-Man vs Kirby
Another thing in Cole's favor. Those who played or at least watched the endings of Infamous 2 know that Cole was empowered by the RFI in the good ending, however from what we know the RFI's ability is primarily the opposite, that of weakening a conduit. We also know that the Beast drained Cole's powers at the end of their first confrontation, and because of that Cole was weaker than in the prologue throughout the entire game, only towards the end of the game did his powers finally surpass their original level.  With this comes my theory, since the Beast is basically a walking Ray Sphere and RFI absorbs "Ray Field Energy", when RFI was fully charged it started absorbing that energy to a small degree. In the process this absorbed the "Beast's energy" that was preventing Cole from accessing/returning his full power. You can notice that at the beginning when Cole prepares for combat and sometimes just by moving he releases electricity, something that stops happening after he has been drained.  What I mean is, the power that was "given" by the RFI is simply *Cole's TRUE POWER*.
You should do kraven the hunter vs the predator.😅
Jet stream sam vs samurai jack please
Complete skip next episode, dbz characters suck
Alex stabbed and almost consumed Cole: NOOOO Coles eye surges with power: YESSSSSSS
Accelerator vs anyone pls
Do Kirito vs Roxas next
Alex to me seems like a character that if you put him down before he gets the ball rolling, you caught him at the perfect time. Adaptation is his strong suit.  If he had spent time fighting the kind of things Cole fights like Conduits and began absorbing them, it would make a huge difference.
Finallyyy, my two favorite emo boys from my childhood
Well this is entirely too late.
Please do Sparrow (Fable II) vs Serah Hawke (Dragon Age II)
FLASH VS BROLY WOULD BE AWESOME SAUCE
FLASH VS BROLY WOULD BE AWESOME SAUCE
Goku’s muffin button is a reference I never thought I’d hear
Hwoarang (Tekken) VS Lui Kang (MK)
Bro I was listening to Linkin Park when he said he's like Kirby if he absorbed Linkin Park 💀
Way to ruin the fight with a trash poppy rap track 🤦
Death battle when will you ever do an actual video of arceus vs beerus.
Well I mean I was rooting for Mercer. But electricity is apparently his weakness. But I still think Mercer should have won that. Mainly cause I'm not even familiar with this Cole Slaw guy.
FRIEZA VS MEGATRON???????? TF IS YA'LL DOING??????  TELL ME WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SEEN MEGATRON......... MEGATRON!!!!!! LEADER OF THE MUHFUCKIN DECECPTICONS!!!!! BLOW UP UP AN ENTIRE PLANET WITH HIS FINGER????????? TELL ME SWAY!!!!! I NEED ANSWERS
Guyver vs. Parasyte Maxim next?
Please Also do King from OPM and Hercule From DBZ / DBS
man, i miss Cole & the infamous series in general.
🔥🔥🔥🔥 and it turned out like I expected and I love it. I had been waiting for somebody to do this battle👏
Frieza vs Megatron 🤔 That’s an odd interesting choice. Two evil aliens facing off against each other!
Still loved it. Despite the... yeah bad script.  The edgylord vibes were hilarious
Lets gooooooo!!!!!!! My dude won
The music. The editing. Awesome.
Definitely Cole
Can you do Harley Quinn vs black widow
I said this match up years ago on another of your battles comment section
Now James Heller vs Delsin Rowe
We need a new infamous game with Cole as the main character
I just want to see Night bomb from Skylanders swap force fighting vs Peacock from skullgirls
Megatron might stand a chance because he has defeated a god name dvoid and defeated shockwave that had the power of a universe and has proven that he can’t be killed by OP himself that can defeat unicron
Cole didn’t even bring out his full kit and still won.
The best fight ever😊
Idk about this one, both cool characters and glad to see them getting love but honestly, isnt cole just a man with electric powers? Mercer is beyond that and wouldnt die or even go down by electricity  You guys sometimes go off of game mechanics which limits what the characters actually do vs what you are able to do in gameplay
FINNALLYYYYYYY!!!!!!!
Day 29 of asking for Pinkie Pie vs SpongeBob SquarePants
Please make Little Mac vs Ippo.
Im so glad that this came right back to the eyes of the media. I enjoyed this game so much when I was younger
Incredible
Ayy, I caught that little muffin button joke u threw in there - love it! XD
Is this...Electro vs Venom?
How does Megatron stand any chance against Frieza at all? lmfao
mid
And why aren't they showing the list of the fighter's weaknesses?
Amazing as always. Not counting Ben 10 vs green lantern tho 😐 alien x come on. anyway what about Jimmy neutron vs Dexter. Or Joe Goldberg the guy from "you" vs serial killer Dexter 👀
🤣🤣🤣 lame 😒
Being a McGrath mah self, I feel strangely proud of this fight
My canon ending for infamous is the evil ending way more fun and badass but hey to each there own.
5 from the Umbrella academy vs Nightcrawler.
Can we get ace (OP) vs rengoku(demon slayer) o r akainu(OP) vs mei (Naruto)?
He aint beating goku though
I can't get enough of thos video. It really does feel like an early 2000s superhero movie finale. Infamous should have gotten a movie
how about shinichi izumi vs bakugo? (parasyte vs my hero academia)
These two are the definition of "I'm my biggest opp"
Those clips were a blast from the past and I'm here for it
These two really were made to be each other's hero and villain huh?
I love this video
I've been wanting this deathbattle for so long!
Okay, nobody’s going to talk about it? Fine. *inhales* MEGATRON VS FRIEZA!?!?
I'm not mad that Alex lost, I'm mad at the way he lost. Critical mass takes him a while to reach yet he STARTED the fight while in it, for starters
Wasn't expecting that nice
this is the fight of my life right here. there is a good number of people that STILL debate this to this day.
I was JUST thinking about those infamous games again! The first two games were so good imo, never got into any of the others but I love this series and I am glad we get to see a nice little throwback
FRIEZA VS MEGATRON?!?!?! WHAT!?!?!?
Now we just need Delsin Rowe vs James Heller
Definitely need an evil cole vs james heller after he absorbed mercer
but what about Vampire Cole?
The first thing I thought when I saw this match up is how Cole has to constantly fight people with weird virus powers, but Alex has never dealt with anything like Cole before.
Hold on...wasnt expecting the music. Somebody invite this man to a cook out
bro evil cole is stronger than good cole
LMFAO at FRIEZA vs. MEGATRON. That's one of the easiest Ws I've ever seen
Heracles (fate stay night) vs hulk sounds like an interesting match up
Wish Infamous could be made available for  💻🙏
Now just need somebody to make a AMV of the fight with linkin park or papa roach playing
Cole was a bad dude. That game was awesome
10/10 one of the best death battles ever!
GANDALF vs DUMBLEDORE
Do goku vs saitama
Cole macgrath and Alex Mercer are my two favorites games characters
OOOOO I been WAITIN for this one!
MY GOD IV BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR YEARSSSSSS
The original Inhumans song was freaking fire and was made for this episode! The animation the action and the soundtrack was all A+ work and everything about it made it top notch and was one of the best episodes I have seen in a long time!
Awesome
WOW that was awesome. That was some A1 animation.
If Kirby listened to Linkin Park
Yall should spongebob vs luffy from one peice
i thought Alex will win but i was wrong
I always wanted to play Infamous, but never had a PlayStation. I absolutely LOVED Prototype though. It was such a good stress reliever to just destroy everyone and everything in an open world game!
Does anyone agree that prototype needs an anime
Since it’s Halloween season can we see scarecrow vs green goblin?
Good. He’s the only PlayStation character that became a temporary DC comic book hero
lol.... well THIS episode came out 10 years after people stopped caring. Durring the bald protagonist days of the -s3 360 era. everyone was bald and angry. lol.
Bible says that swearing is wrong
I love the fight one thing that I would actually be interested in seeing as if both games besides make a return that be cool if there was a bit of a crossover with both of them
We need to get Godzilla vs Reptar one day. Then and only then will I return to watch these videos.
Pickle vs spear pls
I'm a say from the jump this seems one sided.
Hmmmmm I'm going for Alex Mercer
Alex should win
The """"humor"""" in this show makes me wanna become immortal and then try to kill myself over and over again for eternity
Now we have this, we need to see delson row vs James Heller (infamous second son vs prototype 2)
Close call I'd say, this was one of those matchups that might only turn out the same two out of three times.
Alex🔥
I like this one fasho
Do judge dredd vs robocop
This was a match i been wanting to see. 2 of one of my favorites games that i played gone head to head. I wasn’t expecting to that twist with Macgrath winning the battle but it made sense. What surprises more is the fact they forgot about Cole’s Evil ability of Fire? Or is “Napalm”? That Nyx had.
Next year do Noah ( xenoblade chronicles) vs Jake ( avatar)
Didn’t expect that
a ryu hayabusha vs joe musashi battle will be cool
That fight Had me jumping for joy it was so good!  This was Awesome!
Yo can you guys do Raian Kure vs jack hanma? Love the vid btw
How is Frieza vs Megatron even fair?
Bs all he had to do was pull him under water.
As expected you didn't give the victory to the person who clearly was the winner you gave it to the character who was more popular
dang im heading towards 27 too just like Cole
Next "figth" is gonna be very, very, very one sided
Something that I noticed was left out was that in prototype 2. Alex learned to summon infected. Something that your character ends up learning and both  seemingly can summon infected from anywhere. Even in areas that really dont have infected or not enough infected biomass to create what he summoned. He was able go summon those flying birds. Alpha hunters. Cant quite remember what their called but they have the hammer fists. A giant Tendril creature. And even the Street Sweeping building sized, Goliath. Which the goliath as an attack launches itself extremely high and dive bombs with uncanny accuracy causing a giant shockwave upon crashing. Granted in reality it could take out city blocks with that attack. However it keeps knocking itself put anytime it does it.
Madara vs whitebeard
👍
If cole got stabbed in his chest with that blade he would’ve died, wtf are yall talking bout?😒😒😒😑😑
Alex should’ve won, foh
Ngl, I'm just happy there's finally an episode about this match up
I’ve been asking for this one since 2015 🥹
That doesn't make sense. How can you absorb someone's bioelecrricity when they don't produce any? Alex isn't human. He doesn't have bones or a brain. He doesn't need to breath or eat to live. So how would cole kill him in that sense, when alex is several hundred pounds of bio-mass clumped together?
I LOVE Prototype and Alex Mercer, but (unaware of what Cole could do) when I watched the breakdown of Cole's powers, I knew he'd likely be outmatched. I still hope for a Prototype 3 sometime in the future tho, P L E A S E !!!!!
A death battle I'd love to see would be Beatrix from Kill Bill vs John Wick.
Infamous was such a Goated game
will peacemaker be in deathbattle?
Fight was dope music was hot ass. Happy my boy Cole beat Alex
Make Michael Myers Killing Demons As Archangel Michael... That'll Be Dopeness!
a battle between 2 spider-man villan wannabes... nice
Hell yeah! Blast from the past. A shame how both IPs are basically dead now.
Still want to see the omniversal singularity and dark god of chaos Unicron Vs Marvels devourer of worlds Galactus
DAY 1 ASKING FOR GOJO VS KAKASHI
The fight music was sick
We should have gotten a proper second prototype game, growing Alex's powers to fight pariah, someone I imagine to be psychic or telekinetic.  Also, how do they account for Mercer just... running away and eating people to heal or being a virus and spreading, possibly around the world until there are thousands of mercer clones.   Maybe cole can beat one, but an army? Two armies?
Played both these games love them both with all my heart. i think alex mercer will win i will be back after the video
I knew Cole was going to win, but honestly I feel like they did do Alex some injustice here. The final attack to kill him should have visually been much larger. He came back from a nuke after-all. Not point blank but still.
A good match up I think would be Aqua from Kingdom Hearts vs Ahsoka from Star Wars
We've now gotten all of the main three Death Battles I had been requesting over the years... and funny enough, I was wrong about the outcomes of all three matchups!  Ratchet & Clank VS Jak & Daxter The Winter Soldier VS Red Hood And finally, Cole MacGrath VS Alex Mercer
I really miss games like these
God as soon as I saw the name Cole I was hyped, and him vs Mercer my second favorite? I about bust. Cole is so fucking underrated, I remember playing Infamous and having a ball, I could still go pull out my ps3 and 100% the game AGAIN and I'd love every fucking second of it, I remember how hyped I was for Infamous 2. And then I got to the ending and fucking cried as I realized he wouldn't be in any future games, I grew up with that game, I'd give my fucking kidneys to see them both remastered ;-; I wish could go back in time and experience Infamous all over again, just to feel the fucking pure endorphins running through my body as I get a new power from one of the many generator stations underground, don't even get me started about the comic, this shits making me emotional I just want my boy Cole back ;O;
Dumbledore vs Gandalf!!!!! Wth is taking so long for this season 1 requested fight
An absorbing power and 1 healing factor Alex get the fck out of the company u pathetic
I think reading into the Ray Sphere's destructive power is a little misguided -- Kessler might not have been certain Cole would survive it, but that might be better chalked up to not being sure if there were any quirks because of time travel. While it tore apart the Beast's human body (when destroyed), I always assumed it had more to do with his eventual resulting powerset, i.e. his cellular stuff. Notably, it didn't tear apart Bertrand (who was at ground zero of another activation) or Nix (who was very nearby). Neither of which had anywhere close to the durability assumed of Cole -- Nix shooting herself like a bullet at Beast and killing herself only stunned him. Ray Spheres seem to only "activate" anyone with a Conduit gene, and kill anyone without one.   Moreover, the Beast was only killable through a combo of Cole channeling an extreme amount of power through the RFI, after which he used it to kill the Beast -- conventional damage didn't seem to be a possible method of killing the Beast, since he didn't just regenerate from a single cell. He regenerated from like... literally nothing. He was a consciousness without a body. Cole never hit that level of power without distinct external factors.  The Beast wasn't even trying to KILL Cole for most of their fight. Just get rid of the RFI.  Moreover, I don't know why they'd bring up Alex needing to weaken someone for an absorption where I don't recall Cole ever biodraining someone that wasn't literally stuck to the floor, i.e. someone he'd straight up beaten. Takes a while, too.   I'm not nearly as familiar with Prototype as I am inFamous, as I'm a big mark for inFamous, but I think a looot of stuff is being assumed for Cole. Way more likely to agree with Evil!Cole stomping someone, though.
Why did they wait so long? I bought both these games when they were new. And listed to Linkin park while playing them.
Wow guys, 9th october is my turn to fight.
My two favorite games 30 years ago.
Cole macgrath wins the victory infamous
How about Mordekaiser vs Vlaakith. Both being powerful necromancers eating souls for breakfast.
Don't forget the stand alone game where Cole literally became a vampire lol
FUCKING GOKU'S MUFFIN BUTTON HAD ME DYING
Im happy this death battle finally happend. Bit salty as a prototype fanboy but i understand the concept of what you whent with. I was hoping with the increased intelligents alex gained from consuming the smartest people in new york he would think of a way to win and not just brute force it.   But you are right the only way to defeat alex is to consume him completely and hope the virus doesnt eat you alive from the inside out. Where as you explained cole had the advantage. Great battle
This is basically just Electro VS Carnage with more interesting origin stories.
Gotta admit tho cole surfing on one of alex's tendrils was pretty fragging awesomesauce I'll leave you to debate how much of what i said here was reminiscent of human speech
Using E=mc2 here would give you ridiculous numbers, matter energy conversion equation gives you energy from ALL matter, that includes nuclear (hence nuclear bombs are much more destructive than chemical bombs) .... you'll need to compute energy from chemical bonds which is basically electromagnetic,  .... basically you need to compute Calories of any object. What i'm trying to say is your calculations are wrong by 1000 times or so
Expecting Mercer to win, but wanted Cole to win. Very happy with this 😁 I remember commenting about this match up several years ago.
Don't trash the script now while using it could have changed it xD
Deadpool vs PlasticMan LFG!
Having played both games, mercers abilities were all better than coles, period. That being said, vampire cole would have given a mercer a better run for his money.
This one was kinda obvious. It whoud be More interesting Alex Mercer Vs Venom or Alex Mercer Vs Némesis
Since they just had an Electric god i could see them having another one in the form of Zeus. As for his opponent why not Odin. It would be a great fight and one we haven't seen.
I don't know what you're talking about, Boomstick. I LOVED this battle!
I kinda wanted cole to lose lol
I was honestly so pissed when Alex lost, then they explained why and I'm like fuk there right it makes sense but I don't like it
So how did Cole really win this? Sure the atomic vs molecular level makes some degree of sense, but at the end of the day Cole doesn't have a consistent way of handling Alex. Cole actively needs to recharge his electricity otherwise he's just a regular man who can't touch water and to use his big moves he needs ionic charges which only a select few other conduits have, Alex doesn't have any of those limitations, his critical mass devastators need Recharging sure, but his arsenal is capable of just playing the long game with Cole by simply playing keep away. Alex has a whip, hammerfist, muscle arms, claws, and blade, all of which has shown to literally turn the human body to paste on contact, while Cole is a conduit, he's a conduit that still gets hurt by bullets, and none of his regeneration heals fatal wounds, only minor ones. Maybe evil Cole would pull it off sure, but a good Cole gets consumed every day of the week.
Sounds like EPIC RAP BATTLES
I dont agree with this death battle. Cole got stabbed through the gut and at the end of the day he doesnt have a healing factor. He cant survive fatal injuries like that.
Is it odd this battle felt very nostalgic? The way it was written and the match up subjects, it takes me back to when I was a pre-teen.
Cole McGrath forever the goat
That was awesome
It's been a long time since we got a chance to see a battle a hero against a villian
This matchup makes zero sense
Prototype needs a remake
Yea no Alex would win. Sorry but youre wrong on this one.
Cole winning due to resisting attacks and corruptions are debatable at best since everyone gets their powers from the same source, making it understandable they'd all have a resistance to it. In Second Son they even have moments where the main character can't absorb powers from others because they weren't given those powers by the Ray Sphere/Beast explosions, meaning that Conduit powers are uniquely tuned with Conduit powers. They would definitely not give him an edge, and possibly even not a benefit to the degree of full on, or potentially even any, resistance to the virus. Much like far too many outcomes, that relies on the assumption of "It's works in their world with specific rules, so it must work in every possible matchup out there," which everyone knows is just making an assumption for the sake of argument. Outcome still could go either way, but once again, too many assumptions that are treated as multi-universal canon.
coughing baby vs thermonuclear bomb ass matchup
are yall cappin about having a script from 2013
I was routing for cole but I didn’t think he could win that is awesome
How about Yujiro vs Toguro?  Two uber muscular who value strength above all else, are desperately looking for the one who can defeat them, and therefore serve as twisted mentor figures to the protagonists of their stories?  They're also both grotesquely muscular, and are utterly unstoppable brick walls to all who challenge them.
I thought this was going to be McGrath VS star killer 😊
Oh man kashimo vs sakuna gots nothing on this
Seeing this gives me hope for Talion vs Geralt
Who would like to see a Kamen Rider Death Battle Royale since its been awhile since we last had one and I know there are too many riders to use that's why I'm only suggesting the 5 of 7 legendary riders for that battle them being: - Kamen Rider OOO  - Kamen Rider Ghost - Kamen Rider Ex-Aid - Kamen Rider Zi-O - Kamen Rider Zero-One If you guys agree give a like or reply as a side note in a battle who would you think would win?
Bardock vs Madara
Bardock vs Madara
Man, when I was playing Infamous 1 and 2 back in the day, I always had this image in my head of a Neca figure. It's completely criminal that we never got a 1/12 scale figure of Cole. Neca did release two versions of Alex Mercer but we haven't gotten a Cole figure? Not counting the statue but like an actual 6 inch figure or something.
Of course Cole was gonna win. Pft
There were also talks that Cole might not be dead if infamous came back
Edgy middle school me needed this one
I was against the battle until the explanation at the end Well done
I'm glad to finally have an answer for this. I always liked Infamous more anyway, and Cole was a better protag to me. So this was a very affirming match haha.  Next episode feels set up to make Megatron look good no matter what. If they're using only G1 Megs and everything from Frieza, and Frieza wins, well then that just means it took everything to beat one version of Megatron. If Megatron wins, then he's the GOAT and didn't even need any other iteration to pull it off.  Considering G1 Optimus beat the First Gundam and Amuro, I think Megatron has good odds!
John Wick vs The Transporter
I want to see cole (infamous) vs static shock
WHITEBEARD vs ESCANOR
Can you do naruto vs Luffy next if you could
Wow this fight had me on the edge of my seat... the winner i honestly didnt expect and even worried but damn good job!
Frieza vs megatron yo wtf
after all these years
Hell yeah, my boy Cole came out on top! I potentially thought the fight could be close, especially with Alex's healing, but then when I saw in the run down of his feats and abilities they listed his mental processing speed was only 66% the speed of light, I remembered that earlier in the video they said Cole was able to move as fast as electricity in wires, which is 90% SoL, meaning to process what he was doing at those speeds, Cole's mental processing was approaching light speed. Then from there I just figured Cole would be fast enough to Bio-Leech Alex faster than Alex could try to absorb Cole. That and Cole actually won his mirror match against Kessler, while Alex lost his mirror match in Prototype 2.
Tof from avatar last air bender vs magneto if you haven't done it is a suggestion ?
This battle literally rigged how can electricity penetrate Alex Mercer when the guy has literally taken nukes and has come from it this battle joke I mean  beast Cole McGrath has chance not regular Cole McGrath.
I had no idea who either of these characters were but I loved every second of it.  Also, can we get a death battle of the space police? Green Lantern vs Nova.
Are we sure Cole's natural hair color isn't pink? Because Lucy vs. Carnage and Crona vs. Venom both made it clear, pink-haired characters have advantage against evil symbiote things.
Frieza vs Megatron does not make any Sence
Great battle!  But next match is not even worth it… c’mon man
Actually Alex wins because I like him more and I don’t think you guys took that into account
Lol muffin button
do sunset overdive next
Played infamous but never prototype
This years content has officially peaked. I’ve been waiting on a death battle for these two for years & always wondered who would win. Ever since I was in middle school I was obsessed with these games and the story. Especially infamous & infamous 2.
Can we get infamous second son vs prototype 2
Ex wife jokes? This is an old script.
I really wanna see a death battle with War or Death from Darksiders. Who would they fight, though?
How come Alex didn't use hunter? He has control of them why not use them as distractions.
I don't even care about the fight, the fact that Infamous 1-2 and Prototype are getting recognized just makes me happy.
bro i wanna see Rick Grimes VS Joel from the last of us both at they peak they dont have abilities just 2 great leaders fighting to submission or the death
YEEESSS 👏👏👏👏👏
I don't remember much about prototype i played it a little but i do remember having fun playing it on the other hand i have always considered infamous one and two to be my absolute favorite game set especially having flash backs of zeeke saying he was more human than any of us legitimately almost cried like i did the first two times i heard that kind. I actually didn't know who would win but I'm happy cole did.
Bring back INFAMOUS!!!!♥️♥️♥️♥️
Cole tuvo que haber muerto en el aire desde que mercer comenzo a consumirlo pero gano el guionazo que tuvo, no importa a un asi espere esta pelea por añosss.
I’m sorry to say but Alex would win because of that flesh piece Cole crushers at the end drips blood and that’s all Alex needs and Cole got impaled twice and would have died on the first this makes no sense
I can't be the only one who envisioned this battle when psn got hacked and we were allowed to pick 2 games for free. Probably the main reason infamous took off
All fax no cap
Its real, after more than a decade, we finally got this, inFAMOUS 3 and PROTOTYPE 3 would be great this year..
Kratos vs Doomsday please
2:21  ……That is…not what’s happening…. In the game you use that shield to convert the kinetic energy of what hits it into energy.
Spoiler      I've played both prototype and infamous and while I was rooting for alex, I expected cole to be the winner mainly because of the destuctive power difference. Though I will say I was surprised with how much durability cole has. I remember bullets could hurt cole so I assume if alex could impale cole or cut his head off it would be over.
"Good idea" has the same energy as "Thanks for the tip."
Fight was nice, but that music was LIT. Like, how it changed into inspiring heroic when alex failed the absorb cole and cole said “Good Idea…!”
Great fight, terrible result. I played both games back in the day and Alex wins, period. This shouldn't even have been close!
and AGAIN this channel are wrong.
More search bro.
Cole's electricity looked rlly good in this animation good job again death battle
Now the next death battle that we are all waiting for his Goku vs Saitama
I think people would like to see Luffy from one piece vs Naruto
Megatron taking friezas cheeks lets see how the db fanboys try to defend it only if frieza gets hakai and megathon the dark energon
Muzan from demon slayer vs Naraku from Inu yasha
serious 20's vibe
Kratos vs Asura please 🙏
This is unrelated, but the fact that Raiden is a loser now, but Cole is a winner kinda pisses me off. If you played PlayStation All Stars, then you know why.
Awesomesauce!!!
I’ve been waiting for this Death Battle forever!!
Don't forget about Cole going all vampire and just becoming even more broken than before
Even Alex Mercer lose on this fight, we still love him even his a Anti Hero
Frieza vs. Megatron is next....
why havent we got Stewie Griffin vs Dexter yet?
2:15 “ read you mind, like goku’s muffin button”  ….what
Idea for a death battle: Starfire vs Capt Marvel.  If it happens, and we're lucky, it'll be Manvers' 3rd "L". Everything happens in threes after all.
Daaaaaaaaaaaaaamn!
So... When are we getting a Code Lyoko character in death battle?
That's BS mercer should have won yet again DB disappoints me once again smh
My boy Macgrath with the W! Nice 👍
the first time I mentioned this match people were like "Nah alex is unkillable, he would wipe out cole"... WELL JOKES ON ALL OF THEM, cole is WAY more powerful, I knew I was right all along :3
ay ill say mercer seemed the most to win for how he's so more versatile it felt like over cole but to learn that "nope cole is way more stronger and can basically just fry him" wasn't expecting
I'mma need Dontai to play and finish prototype before watching this death battle
16:19 KO
Bio vs Electricity!
IDW Megatron vs Black Frieza boutta be insane.
im sorry but Alex is way too versatile for cole to kill him by absorbing his bio electricity. somthing alex could counter by just absorbing coles biomass in the process.  alex isnt as defensive as cole but Alex literally cannot die. he can only be absorbed. as long as his biomass remains. cole would literally have to vaporize him down to his last cell.
Can we see Alice vs Selene aka Resident Evil vs Underworld.
i'm still bothered about Heller killing Alex🤦‍♂️
You gotta do the lich or golb from adventure time!!!!!
I knew when his balls went lighting blue he was gonna win 😂
I can’t wait for this one to face that one
12:54 is the infamous prototype of this fight
Waited 10 years for this , and it was worth every second
FINNALLY FRIEZA!!!!🎉🎉🎉
Ahahaha, the muffin button xD
Motoko from Ghost in the shell vs V From Cyberpunk
Love the Battle
This doesn't really make any sense. While most of Cole's abilities counter Alex (if Alex doesnt adapt to them, that is), if Alex lands even a single cut on Cole, that's an instant win seeing as Cole would be immediately infected.  Draining Alex's neuro electricity is very doubtful, he's a sentient virus, he doesn't have the organs, bones or muscles to have Neuro electricity.  Also they for some reason just completely neglected to mention that in Prototype 2 Alex displayed the ability to release a gas of Blacklight virus in his near vicinity that immediately infects everyone around him. With his Prototype 2 characterization that would immediately be his go to move against Cole when he realizes how powerful Cole is, yet he never did that here. They also never mentioned Alex's ability to summon infected minions like Brawlers and Birds and his passive regeneration. DB once again missing.
I seen a meme and now I want to see the Death Battle... Matilda vs Eleven lol
Okay now I'm wondering how a fight between Delsin and Heller would go. Cause Heller was strong enough to take Alex down and Delsin was one of the few who were able to survive the RFI's power. And while Heller is more brutal and determined, Delsin's powers give him intangibility as well as a lot of ranged options and tricky abilities.
That ending was one for the record books, it is just perfect
There should actually be a game for both of them to face each other that would be dope
Ellie (The Last of Us) -VS- Clementine (The Walking Dead) Who wins?
I love the song choice that matches the 2009 release dates, I felt like a kid again, I remember these releasing, playing small bits of it at friends' houses and never having any idea that either of the stories described in this video even existed lmao
I’d give all my organs for a new installment of either of these
V VS DAVID MARTINEZ, CYBERPUNK 2077 AND EDGERUNERS!
Bro random match up but imagine  Metro Man VS SpongeBob
Infamous and prototype🥹perfect
Cole McGrath won like a total badass perfect ending.
I remember when both of these games came out and everyone was like Cole vs Alex. Who wins. Now we know
Awesome fight, I was excited to learn about inFamous! Also, I feel that next time is gonna disappoint a lot of people, but I’m curious to see what can be done with it Edit: after watching this fight a few times, I love the all the small details. Like how Alex feels like an absolute monster throughout this fight; every time he runs there’s this booming thump with every step, like he’s Juggernaut or something, it’s great. Also, Coke using his powers strategically and the lighting effects are excellent as well
I would like to see iron man vs bluebettle
Videl VS anyone from street fighter or mortal kombat
Need to see spawn vs ghost rider
Powerful Death Battle like both are powerful and put on a great fight and Cole did awesome defeat on Alex. 😮😮😊
how about Kessler VS Dark Raiden (Infamous VS Mortal Kombat) ? 🤞🏻
was that...was that optimus prime?!
As minor nitpicks, while Cole did resist Sasha's tar, he was not unaffected by it, moreover, are we saying Alex's ability to corrupt is only as strong as Sasha? It's probably stronger. Also, Alex can start absorbing Cole's biomass anytime he touches him, even with an attack, even his blade attack. Any of those moments he struck or held Cole he could spend absorbing him. Also, the Beast never used that super strong attack against Cole. Output matching durability really only is a thing for physical contact. So it works for Mercer who is all physicality, but Cole is more questionable. Which brings his durability and output in to question since the same applies to The Beast. We have plenty of emitters who put this concept to the test in real life. Most emitters cannot withstand the same beating they dish out. They're just not structured for it. Does a grenade output more force than an axe? Yes, but can an axe destroy a grenade? Also, yes. I watched more amateur channels come to the same conclusion though, and mostly similar with a few differences in all of them and yours though, so I'm not surprised you came to the same conclusion and I'm not really arguing the conclusion. It's all just fun thought experiments in the end. Edit: Most of them used Evil Cole or Hybrid all powers Cole though. I do think Alex would lose to those, but I'm actually not sold on Good Cole even after your video.
I'm not happy that mercer lost, but I understand why he lost. I just adore prototype, such a fun game
What about this deathbattle between Phineas and ferb Vs Susan and mary (Johnny test vs phineas and ferb)
I was the one voting for this matchup since forever. Finally, my work is done. As an aside, there's an argument to be made that Alex lost to Heller on purpose. If you play the fight, it's actually quite noticeable that he holds back. Moreover, the entire time he's giving you tips on how to beat him. The entire game Alex was trying to create better evolved. Maybe his endgame was he needed to get consumed himself to make Heller better. Maybe Heller and Alex Mercer are now one.
what's wrong with awesomesauce? I mean it has to be better than lamesauce, cuz one is awesome and the other is lame.
I really appreciate it when they actually do good animation for these battles. I don't bother watching the low res sprites ones.  I was a huge fan of Cole. I loved those games. I felt really disappointed in 2nd Son though... Just couldn't get into the character or his powers.
He killed him by sucking his energy?! 🤢
Are they serious with the next battle? I'm sure they'll do some crazy science but my brain can't come up with any scenerio where Megatron could possibly beat Frieza. In my mind Frieza handles Megatron at extremely low diff. The power scaling in DBZ is so crazy I think Krillin could beat Megatron.
Saint seiya vs yuyu hakusho
Badass.
Hopefully this video will make prototype have a following because it’s a pretty fun game and can you imagine a prototype three for the PS4 that would be awesome
Thrawn vs Picard. Two tactical geniuses with an academic sophistication. Also give you an excuse to settle the Star Trek vs Star Wars debate.
Daaaamn!! This really awesome 👍!
A battle of tyrants for the next death battle.
Been waiting on this one
I guess i am human after all …just like Alex …. Waaaait
sick battle ruined but trash music rip
Kaido v Kenpachi
Could cole take on magneto tho
I DONT CARE WHO HE FIGHTS GET ADAM SMASHER ON DEATH BATTLE!
I can say that was the best video game fight this year 💯
I need this battle: -jenny wakeman(my life as a teenage robot) -monkey d. Luffy(one piece)
Hey DB do lendgery Godzilla vs twilit sparkl pleas I need to see this 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Alex could've actually defeated cole had he consume an individual infected with the conduit genes   that could've given him some conduit abilities
Can we get the protagonist from infamous second son and prototype 2
I hope you guys do the Left 4 Dead crew versus the Nazi zombies crew I'd like to see how that one turns out 😂
I admit wile cole has the power advantage i disagree with this conclusion cole is a normle human with Power of the elements essentialy. Wile mercer can lift up to 20,000 tons.  all mercer had to do is deck cole in the face 1 time. The explosion from coles origen story dose not meen he can survive a nuke It probably was sercomstantial survival. he was the one that caused its likely the ball thing protected him and the other mutants. even if his energy capasity is on a nuclear scale dosent mean his phisical form can resist a nuke. Remember cole has power over energy wich meens he may have transmoged the blasts that hit him dosent mean he him self is super durable.
If Thor didn't  make us salty get ready for a oversize Robot kill our dragon ball z character
But could he beat Mr Rogers in a bloodstained sweater?
They should definitely pick a character from Baki
Olá Death Battle quero que você faça uma batalha entre dois personagens um para poderosos Q e Bill Cipher Vs Dimentio de Gravity Falls Vs Paper Mario
Polkadot man vs the spot?
Ahhhhhhhh. The good ol days. I remember when these games dropped.
At last it's been settled.
why in DEATH BATTLE always real winner gonna lose
PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale who?
Megatron vs Freza is far from equal fight.
The conduit gene was not wiped! My hypothesis is that while many of them died when the RFI went off, there was a stronger variant of it that allowed a majority of Conduits to survive.
I didn’t expect Cole to win this one.
Death Battle idea dat can never happen   Who do u think will win in a team fight???  Spider-Verse (Marvel Comics) or Dark Multiverse Batmen (DC Comics)
knull vs superman
I kinda want ahsoka vs starkiller. I know it's a wash but it would be fun.
Im happy they finally did this battle,  but alex mercer definitely wins this
"We havent enptied out trash in 10 years?!" Sound like me and my emails.
This was an awesome episode! It reminded how cool these characters are, even though I forgot both of them existed and had to Google one to remember who he was.   Also, Rick Sanchez vs. Korvo Opposites.
Of course Alex was dominating like 90% of the fight until cole grabbed him once
please do james heller vs Delsin rowe 🙏
As an inFAMOUS fan this made me so happy, waiting 10 years was totally worth it. Cole and Alex were legends in the PS3/360 era of gaming and seeing the result just made me even more happy. God I wish inFAMOUS and Prototype got another chance to be relevant again they just brought a different vibe compared to other open-world sandbox games.
I loved this. These games were my top favorite games as a kid, the animation, voice actors, and the fight itself make this my favorite episode yet
BAKI HANMA VS OHMA TOKITA😮😮😮😮😮😮
What a twist, I was expecting Mercer to win after surviving a nuke, but I'm glad Cole was able to pull a win
Years ago I once recommended Rex Salazar of Generator Rex Vs Alex Mercer of Prototype.  While not the match up I expected it was very entertaining. Good luck on the next episode.
Why do you even think that Cole's shield is inpenetrable? I belivee there were some attacks that hit Cole anyway. For example explosions or big heavy objects thrown in Cole. Alex can throw a car or blown up helicopter from a mile away. I am sorry but the result of this battle is absolutely wrong for me. And I am not a fan of any of this characters.I just really enjoyed playing these games.
This was heavily skewed in Coles favor
Dear Death Battle: please do 1. Rimuru Tempest Vs. Anos Voldigoad.  2. Baki Hanma vs. Ohma Tokita  🙏🙏🙏
B*******, it's not destruction of his cellular structure. It's an infection, it is nothing. Do a size or level of material? It's an infection that works at I could genetic level in Nano seconds. It is nothing to do with whether or not you can survive a blast or any of it. Mercer eats Cole. Or the very least, can infect them.
Great video, thanks
Baki hanma  vs Kegan ashura
Really? Megatron vs Frieza? There's no competition, Frieza will wipe the floor with him. Seriously, he won't even need the golden form😂
if frieza is gonna be in the next death battle, I don't think they should feature his Black form. we barely know anything about it, so it would be unfair to assume it's either weaker or stronger than Megatron's best
Kitana vs chun-li!!!
Awesome Sauce.
I'm rooting for Cole (even though I love them both)  Yaass!
Are we just not gonna talk about the irony of Alex being Codenamed ZEUS and then getting disintegrated by Cole's lightning?
This was awesome! It felt like a climatic final battle between 2 foes, and it not be bad.
Hey if we can get a MORTAL KOMBAT themed death battle i would love to see ashrah fight cetrion 😅
Doope
Pt. 4 tryna make Erron black vs John Marston
Ghost runner vs Johnny silverhand or v from cyberpunk
Until the next battle
Conduits are incredibly powerful. I really wish Sony would make another InFamous game. That world has so much potential.
Can we PLEASE get a second vid of this fight with evil Cole?
Remember kids, always play in Good karma when playing Infamous.
"The only vermon i see here.... is you" is actaully a badass and heroic line. man i really love Cole.
The only weakness of cole is his vulnerability to corruption that was highly unlikely
Can we see Tobias Whale vs Kingpin?
Best match up ever and in 3D too, you guys made this special. Thank you soo much.
is it just me, or does it feel like alot more love and attention was put towards bill vs discord (i might be baised)
zane ninjago vs ice King
Ainz ooal gown vs the lich (overlord vs adventure time)
I waited 10 years just for the person I was rooting for to lose, that hurts
Reptile from MK vs Killer croc from DC?
Never thought I'd see Cole MacGrath In a death battle..... awesome
I think a proper match for these characters would b generator Rex's Rex Salazar for alex and sunset overdrive's player for cole
If you take a second the match up doesn't really make sense, alex is a super human mutant homunculus, cole is almost a literal GOD
Alex Mercer takes this one
I always wondered what happened to these two IP's'. As mysteriously as they arrived, they were gone just as fast.
Hold on wasn't evil cole the canon for the first game? They mention he ACTIVATES the ray Sphere and zeke calls him the demon of empire city in the good ending of 2
¡Yujiro vs Kenshiro!
Can y’all please do goku vs Naruto
Coke scruubha
Moneyy city hit em ha
12:47 combatant ha
Skills fofofk
Cred show broddd
Do Superman vs Popeyes the slailer  man
Up ante fsther foo
Day one of asking for Kratos vs Luffy.
So many people would want a remaster and new game in both these series
"Goku's muffin button"
Damn this season of death battle has all really been about  freeing there opponents from there personal nightmares would have been nice if Alex's last shred of humanity came out at the end  and said thank  you to cole
Hmmm muffin button
feels like you should do alex mercer vs carnage(maybe the new carnage that absorbed powers from heroes and villains across multiverses)
Wow this is the best episode i think I've seen all season 🎉
2013?! I've been asking for Alex Mercer in db forever and you guys had the script for 10 YEARS!?
i forgot about this episode...  After the episode...  WUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT....
with black frieza around there isn't any way megatron is touching him.  this is going to be a slaughter
Fun fact: Both Cole and Alex wore a bra once, when the escapist suggested they should wear one just to see which one is better.
Nothing like death battle to make fun of the fans for voting this
Awesome sauce
I miss this type of stuff from those years
You’re god damn right
Frieza better not lose... After one-shotting Goku and Vegeta
Kill count can you do Brandon from BrightBurn and Ryan from Boys? Because I think it would be interesting
Frieza will absolutely decimate megatron like really?
Alex should've went up against Jackie Estacado from Darkness
I thought they'd already done this one, but turns out I was thinking of zero punctuation 😅
Could you guys please make a Sun Wukong Vs Kratos, people have been wondering who would win, and you guys are the experts at figuring out who would win a Death Battle
What I love most is that they reference Linkin Park and the battle song sounds like something out of Meteora.
After Frieza  vs Megatron  you maybe make Dante vs Kratos
Arthur Morgan vs erron black  Day 1
I'd like to point out how Cole can only rip the electricity from people he's weakened to the point of near death. And how does resisting having his atoms ripped apart by the ray sphere (which he only was able to due to his equivalent of having the 'X-Gene'), equal to being able to resist being eaten at the cellular level?
Literally got a PS3 just for Infamous, glad to see Cole gets the respect he deserves and there wasnt bias in this episode.
ahh so we not going to tolk about if you dont completly destroy ever cell of alex he can and will regenerate  and  still be fighting
Okay wait this fight was cool but Frieza vs Megatron??? I’m really interested in how that goes.
I hope Microsoft revives the Prototype franchise.  Maybe if they do that will get Sony to revive Infamous.  I honestly miss these open world, sandbox, power fantasy games because all the current sandbox games are still rooted in some form of reality. Screw reality, let me suplex someone off of the empire state building.
343 gram bullet!!! That's freaking huge! I'm going to guess you meant 343 grain bullet
Bro The Infamous and Prototype games are PEAK games and Infamous needs more games i genuinely that franchise could be one of the best gaming franchises ever
A great job on that i realy thought alex would win but i don't realy care that battle was awesome.
WHOA, I'm just so surprised and glad this isn't an 8-bit battle
Yeah nah as much as I love Cole I don't think he'd win against Alex. He'd probably hurt him pretty bad but the problem is The Blacklight Virus evolves and mutates too fast to adapt to new threats. Eventually Alex would adapt to be able to absorb Cole's electricity. It took another host absorbing Alex to "kill" him. Also Cole would need to weaken Alex too to use Bio-drain since in game he only does it to people incapacitated.
11:20 Kirby Symbiote? Sounds like a new Copy Ability.
DELSIN ROWE VS JAMES HELLER Officially needed
Alex was close to victory, before it blew up in his face.
Like gokus muffin button...
Really wish theyd bring these games to switch like they did RD, witcher 3, the arkham triology, and doom.
Thought they already did this match up?
i feel like they should do asura from asuras wrath vs kratos from god of war since they are very similar characters with similar storys
What kind of death battle is frieza vs Megatron that's an obvious win for Frieza 💀
Hey how about you do a battel between sergent wilhelm vs adam samsher
Goat games
I knew an equal amount about Mercer and Cole. Going into this I knew both were OP and could one shot people with their powers. I often confuse the 2 in my memory, since I only watched a roommate go through their games. But that was a one sided slaughter just about. Cole was just 2 good at tanking BS. Good vid.
0:05 intro
I love the Prototype series, even though he's very close to Mercer in abilities, I love Heller and the 2nd game.
What if delsin rowe vs cole macgrath
It's SHOCKING they didn't do this fight sooner.
Next you should do a Starborn (Starfield) vs a Warlock Guardian (Destiny)
megatron vs Frieza? Look, I'm a ride or die TransFormers fan, but TransFormers DOES NOT SCALE to Dragonball...anything. Frieza blows up planets. Know who blows up planets in TransFormers? No one. Only Unicron destroys planets, and he EATS them. And he's regarded as a GOD. Who thought this pairing up?
2009 returns with a bloody good vengeance. Awesome fight, glad we getting the good 3D treatment!
Bowdle against Bowser and four
Gojo vs the lich
wow this was actually very impressive, also didn't expect Cole to win. Props to you guys
Luffy vs Escanor...no Gohan vs Invincible...no Tweety and Sylvester vs Tom and Jerry... no Frieza vs Megatron...YES!
Talia Al Ghul vs Black Widow
I agree with everything in the fight EXCEPT Cole being able to resist the virus itself. I was sure it would be how Alex closed the gap due to it adapting to match your DNA to become you, essentially.  I also chuckled at this from a gameplay perspective. Lorewise, Cole is a LOT stronger than presented in the games, where you could be killed by an angry mob of unarmed civilians (fists do more damage than bullets in game, which is why I was surprised he could even think while impaled by Alex's spine-destroying blade). Regardless of the outcome, Cole DESERVED the win more. They went through much the same stuff, though Cole died a hero, whereas Alex became jaded and had to be put down like a dog... Against his prior development.
Peter griffin vs homer simpson
Out of all of these death battles, including vader and guts, alex just has that menacing and monsterous aura to him. Definitely one of my most favorites
its only right then that you do Delsin Rowe from infamus second son and James Heller from prototype 2
this was easily one of the best fights and the music was epic throughout the fight
*typing* Delsin Rowe…versus..James Heller
Been a while since I've heard "Let's end this debate once and for all"   What a throwback!
Cole didn't erase the conduit gene forever apparently since Delsin was born a conduit
That was amazing
I'm waiting for the alita battle angel fight lol
I know we will never see it, but Duke Nukem vs Serious Sam would be dope.
These games need to come back, they were awesome
Unicron vs Galactus PLEASE!!!
Waterboy vs Forrest Gump
Well, that's a L for Frieza
Lord Raptor versus Brook. Undead bard battle!
It's fracking 2023! Why don't we have a proper reboot of Prototype already!!!
Where's Stocking Anarchy VS Death The Kid?
Serious sam vs Duke nukem
Would love to see Kaneki vs Kokushibo already know Kaneki would clap
the music was terrible
Hello! I love your videos! They're so friggin' awesome!! I like hyper-realistic explanations of characters with unnatural abilities or scientifically calculable supernatural phenomenons. It's badass in my opinion. I was wandering if it's possible for you guys to make a video about accelerator from the anime "a certain magical index" vs rimuru tempest from the anime "that time I got reincarnated as I slime. And since rimuru is do damn powerful in the anime, why not have it where he's vs the manga version of accelerator.. or something?
"Long after these characters were ever relevant!"   Didn't they make Fox Mccloud fight a freaking obscure cartoon rabbit?
Ik megatron wins because they're gonna be using his comic version,  but it's gonna be sick
Why were they so hesitant to make this episode? It was fire. and I haven't even played the games.
*SPOILERS*   As infamous as Alex was, he was just the prototype for a Cole-er hero!   And Boomstick should’ve stomped on the script with his shotgun leg.
Idea: Colossatron vs. Godzilla (or Metal Sonic)
Once the One Piece ends we really need to see a Naruto vs Luffy db.
I sad the mind reading backfiring didn't happen.
Read your mind like muffin button...
Idk if you still take requests, but it'd be cool to see the power puff girls fight something
How does Cole get a better fight with Alex than the one we got in Prototype 2 with Heller 🤣  Great fight all around! Knew Alex wouldn't win, but it's nice to see him and Cole again!
If they are unwilling to do a remake of Prototype someone needs to do it.
Who votes for upgraded titan speakerman vs mecha Godzilla
I like Cole way more but I think both coles, good and evil, would lose to mercer
I’ve been waiting for this for YEARS!!
still would rather have Alex's powers.
Anyone notice how Alex has the powers of all the homunculi from Full Metal Alchemist?  Lust - Razor claws Gluttony - Eats people to heal Envy - Shapeshifting Greed - Armoured form Wrath - Vision modes Sloth - Super speed and hammer arms Pride - Tendrals  Wrath might be pushing it, but I always thought it was neat.
Black Frieza ???
Not sure I agree with the outcome. Most of the things Cole survives are energy based attacks which he is uniquely suited to deal with. Alex Mercer has more combat experience and mainly uses tendrils and bladed weapons. Just not sure I'm buying the guy with comparable strength with a healing factor loses to a guy without one.
I was expecting Alex to win, but I'm happy Cole did!
Amazing
Heller was stronger.. why not have him fight
Y'all should drop a dbx with Pire Night Cole from Festival of Blood.
if boomstick vs wiz isnt the season finale im quiting death battle
Well, it really is surprising since these 2 Battle it out And suddenly I do like Heroes versus Villains in Death Battle And it was surprisingly was good efforts And talk about going all out Attack I definitely like watching death Battle.   Additional word: I do remember playing infamous On the PS3 version Playing the 1 and 2 I did the hero side thing But it's a shame I didn't do the villain side thing. Well, his infamous side
So does that mean cole can beat Deadpool too?
See now, THIS is a fair fight.
Ooh Frieza versus Megatron is gonna be cool they always do amazing with dragon ball characters
I love how Cole's finishing move was one of his simplest, most lethal moves he can have.  A Bioelectric Drain/ Thunder Drop combo.
I would love another second son game but going based off the evil timeline instead. Could make for a cool story and game but alas....
NVM WHO WON OR LOST THAT WAS AN AMAZING FIGHT. CAN U GUYS PLZ TRY TO DO BIG FIGHTS LIKE AIZEN VS MADARA LIKE THIS QUALITY 3D.
bro, what a good fight, it's insane, go
just like their progenitor, Crackdown, these games have been abandoned by an industry that has milked their design elements to death.
That was… shocking as hell.
Inuyash vs DANTE PLEASE
Its sad that both these characters were destined to death   Maybe if mortal Kombat 13 or 2 comes out maybe the dev can include them it would be awesome
I have a death battle recommendation, Giganto from Sonic Frontiers VS The Emperator Class Titan from Warhammer 40k. Basically a Titan vs Titan battle, and I wanna see which one wins. Thanks if you guys made it tho.
Ive been waiting for this for years tbh
Day 1 of asking for gojo (JJK) vs kakashi (Naruto)
This should have been a tag team battle. Cole and the guy from Second Son vs Alex and Heller. And the team that wins fight each other after just because
Casey Jones vs sportsmaster
So, we can't have a Tifa vs yang rematch because it's not worth the money as everyone knows it would be a stomp in Tifas favor. but spending the time and money making a Megatron stomping Freiza episode is, ok? I'm thinking people just are too scared to see Yang lose in a fair fight.
Its been worth the wait but know it’s time for the battle of(INhumens)
I'm a big fan of Prototype, since I was a kid. I draw him alot, bought his Jacket, and makes simple digital arts about it until now. Cole may win in this fight, but Alex will always be the winner, even if he loses.
Lord gegatron his paowr level is over 9000
I thought Alex was gonna win but honestly love that cole did.
When the most i have to nitpick with the fight is "alex mouth movments feel jank, and the ending shot coulda lingered a little longer" you know this is one hellva episode
I love how it feels like cole is just in one hell of a boss battle. And with the lyrics like "its just me" really emphasise this
this is an F tier battle, solely because asura vs kratos didn't happen because of it
Glad to see that outcome, stopped playing Prototype because I hated the main character so much.
this was a good one but doomy guy vs kratos
yes but how does 7 megatons of tnt equal a certain amount of electricity  and how can you find that number oooooohhhh you going of a video game lol my god
This video Really amazing sick awesome
Dexter Vs. Jimmy Neutron
Now do delsin (infamous second son) vs James (prototype 2)
Dudes! Do John Wick VS The Equalizer
Kengan Ashura vs. BAKI !!!  MAKE IT HAPPEN!
Wow, DB claims alex is smarter & experienced but alex keeps getting hit by cole's ice attack consistently, And not adapting at all..lol. This fight is clearly downplaying alex. Alex still wins against cole, very lazy research. Alex is portrayed like a mindless brute, just throwing powers out. That's not alex. Very disappointing fight, I expected better honestly. Also how is cole grinding on the tendrill lol, they are not powerlines...Why is good cole bio leching DB? so many questions.
Every track I get on fire 🔥   Death battle You are such a beautiful inspiration to me maybe one day I can have view and likes on my videos
FINALLLLYYY
I really wanted Alex to win but I'm not mad
Freezer vs Megatron we know who going to win that it's freezer
To be honest the way that Frieza might be able to win is if add friezas new form dark form that able to contend with beerus and ultra instinct Goku and ultra ego vegeta
Pinocchio lies of P vs Aegis steel rising.
Already knew Alex was gonna lose because of the way he talks, he talks like one of those villains in cliche villains vs heroes fights where the villains always loses to the heroes
awesome episode. excellent animation. thank you.  <3
Instant classic.  Imagine sitting on these franchises and not making more games.  Couldn't be me.
I love that they kept the 'lets end this debate once and for all' to pay omage to their 2013 script
Original Goku va Abridged Goku
Where’s Mumm-Ra vs Skeletor?!?!  It’s been how many years and this matchup still hasn’t occurred?!?!?
Anybody eles think the next match is just gonna be a blowout cause aint no way megatron beats frieza like seriously frieza blinks and a planet (and probably more) is gone megatron gets busted up buy our tech megatron should fight one of the megazords or like space godzilla lol frieza is way to op for him
"The universe shall hear my name AND TREMBLE" I'm going to see a lot of cope on Oct 9th
this was dope
As much as I loved Alex Mercer. I could see this result coming, well done Death battle and thank you for calling attention to these two classic series!
Do they take the voices from the game or recreate them
Megatron vs Frieza? Aw come on....
This battle was pure awesome-sauce
I'm kinda curious on what makes y'all do the fights in 3d
Rain (MK1) vs Senju Tobirama (Naruto)
I've been asking you clowns for over a decade for this fight and you fucked it up
Growing up Prototype was one of my favourite games, but I was aware of Infamous as well, so this was a GREAT start to my day. Also, if we don't get a R-rated Venom spinoff game, can we please see Prototype and Infamous remade?
15:57 anime moment
It's kinda amusing in a dark way that what was essentially the grave mind of Prototype, Alex Mercer, tried to just be a 'normal human'.
Lol crazy Cole was my boy but I honestly saw the match up and thought he was done for.
Cool
As someone who use to play the crap out of infamous at my local best buy and games top despite never owning a ps3. Its great to see Cole again
For the first time in my life I'm insanely happy to be wrong I was rooting for Cole but expecting mercer to win i thought he was way more powerful but turns out cole was on another level so thank christ I was wrong
IMO, Infamous would've killed it on PC, as would've a third Prototype game. Sucks neither happened.
Perfect Cell vs Meruem (HxH)
goku vs saita plss next
V (Cyberpunk 2077) vs Mokoto Kusanagi (GiTS)
What's the song name in the battle?
next match doesn't feel like a fair fight but im down
Sonic vs turbo please whiz and broomstick
With the recent One Piece series and Luffy going gear 5 in anime now, it seems like the perfect time for a Luffy vs Naruto battle...
Crazy things was I just re played the prototype games like a week  ago fastest game download ever
Megatron is getting clapped hard in rhe next one
I think it would be like this. Cole would shoot with his lightnings like PIU PIU. And then Alex approaches him with speed of sound, hits him with his super muscles, Cole’s head explodes. THE END.
I believe I speak for everyone when I say the death battle we all want is wiz vs broomstick
Frieza vs. Megatron? Who came up with that? Frieza is a universe buster, and Megatron while awesome gets outwitted and sometimes even beaten by humans, let alone Autobots like Prime.
Id like alex va carnage
Kim Possible vs Nigel Uno
Is frieza vs Megatron even close?
Music is a little loud compared to the audio at times.
how would james heller fair against cole
omg i use to love both of these games back in ps3 days my favorite was definitely alex but this was a good character selection really didn’t know who had the edge 🔥🤗
Let's be real, Shadow the Hedgehog could take em both
Runescape VS WoW
Winner has to fight jackie from darksiders
looks like alex got the cole virus
Wow I am actually really surprised by the outcome of this fight
Any inFamous lovers in the comments... Band together to see if Sucker Punch'll make inFamous 3. If we can band together to get this episode of DB published, we can surely tell Sucker Punch to stop dancing around the grave they made for the game series.
Alex mercer vs Muzan would've been more even. But they're not thematically similar.
My opinion hands down the second best fight in the season right next to skyrim vs dark souls
What did Cole do to Alex at the end, after saying "Good idea"?
This is the fight we all wanted years ago when the two came out. I’m very pleased with the outcome.
I hope this video inspires remasters of these games and and more animations like after seeing this i feel like cole could probably kill muzan jackson who agrees
"Alright! The combatants are set. Lets end this debate once and for all!"  So the data has _not_ been run through all possibilities, then?
Why does "Dr Alex Mercer" look like Scarecrow from Batman Begins?  Also....these two should totally have been in the Magneto vs Akira matchup. Its essentially that
Of course... saw this one coming when they hinted at them using all of Coles abilities, incorrectly using the equation for converting matter into energy, and dumbing down Mercers power.  By my math, the M230FL round has the energy of 5.2 Megatons... not 7.3. Alex Mercer also has Adrenaline Surge, making him invulnerable for a brief moment. He can run up to 500mph... vertically. He is also highly resistant to ELECTRICITY. They gave Cole both the Napalm Manipulation and the Ice Manipulation... It's one or the other not both. Only Napalm can drain energy from objects and doesn't work on larger objects.  My guess is they used the 'Vision' that Cole had where he was at the height of his potential, and just got lazy. Another L for the DB research team.
I'd love to see how they examine the eminence in shadow
ive been watching a lot of Ru Pauls drag race lately and the idea these two queens (Frieza and Megatron) going at it sounds like a campy lip synch battle I don't wanna miss!
I don’t see how Alex dies, thought he can always regenerate?
Why did the Prototype game end ?… I used to play the 2 game and it was great !
aww man i wanted mercer to win, he is one of my favorite characters
Physics Vs Biology.
Please do They Sentry vs Superman
Such bs 🧢
Now i kinda want to see a sequel version. Deslin vs heller. Idk if it would be the same oitcome but different powers and abilities so maybe
Do yall like just do the same the winner pulls something last second? Just makes it obvious who's gonna win when u make 1 of them cocky or when it's all 1 sided at first
Let’s see Edward Elric vs Winter Soldier
👍
Can the Dragon Ball versus Transformers be hand drawn animation can you please do that for me I don't understand pixelating
I would love to see bullseye vs deadshot
Alex should've won tbh. he could send a million blades at which Cole can't block forever
I want to see street shark vs teenagers mountain turtles
Okay but what if Alex fought vampire Cole? I remember vampire Cole being a thing in a DLC.
Frieza versus Megatron? That is going to be the most one-sided fight of all time.
I don’t see Megs doing great against Frieza. Especially not at his level by _Dragon Ball Super._ Megatron doesn’t even have an immortal Spark like Starscream.
Guys should do Fallout 4 vs Bio Shock
This naturally has to have a part two.  The second son, vs the Mercer killer. It's been years since I played prototype 2. I do not remember his name.
Cool but I think it's not lore accurate, he's consumed so much like millions to be more powerful than that, so cole would struggle a bit more than this. Just like how they did prototype 2 dirty, alex could kill james with only his bare hands because he's much more powerful, smarter and faster due to soo much biomass he already absorbed. When james consumed a scientist and still didn't know how to use a super computer I  was like "what tf, man? How tf you're still dumb even though you already ate and took that scientist's memories?"
This was good
I live battles where i know nothing about the characters so the scaling doesnt hurt
I remember about three years ago writing this exact same suggestion. I’m glad someone had the exact same idea as mine and had their voice be heard.
Baki Hanma vs Tokita Ohma
So, Looking at both of their abilities for out right killing people this would be who gets to first upper hand or blow. All Alex would have to do is penetrate Coles skin in order to absorb him in moments. Cole would have to devour his bio-electricity in order to kill Alex. It would be a quick fight with these abilities because it just take one of them getting the upper hand.
HELLBOY VS THE THING
Huh. I predicted Mercer winning this fight due to his ability to absorb and copy his victims. After the break down I was surprised. Pleasantly surprised.
Mereum vs Sukuna.
Prototype batter
Wouldn’t be cole mcgrath if it didn’t have a dive bomb attack
Cole with bio leech is so Op, imagine if he can bio leech strong characters like Goku, Venom and Superman.
Why did you give Cole the ice powers rather than the fire ones? Becomming a human missile is the best!
Sanguinous vs femtoe
Can we see a match between byakuya kuchiki vs sesshomaru
Baki hanma vs Ohma Tokita
I used to imagine a Michael bay fight of these two if it ever were to be a film. I was so young lol. Middle school - I’m 26 now
I need Rick vs someone
Frieza Vs Megatron? Black Frieza took out both Goku and Vegeta who are on par with a god of destruction, this should be a slaughter
Alternate Title:Cole Macgrath Vs Alex Mercer (Activision Vs Playstation) | DEATH BATTLE!
frieza vs megatron....like there was no other match ups?
great video
SANDMAN VS CLAYFACE
Never played these games but I admit they both look pretty fun. Would love to see a remaster of them.
Do dual ems kakashi vs gojo unlimited  void
Finally
Titenfall2 vs halo
I'd love to see a video between Domino vs Squirrel Girl
They did not even talk about Cole fight vampires or is that not cannon?
For the Frieza VS Megatron teaser, my money would be on Frieza.
Dude I saw a whole retrospective on Prototype the same day this came out. I thought James Heller was more interesting than Alex
Gokus muffin button.  Excellent work.  Thank you
Kind of disagree that Alex needs to weaken them in order to consume them as he consumed 8 evolved in the final fight with Heller just by touch. In the end I feel as though the short comings that are listed in gameplay are just for challenge difficulty in both games rather than any accurate lore.
Can we get mr fantastic vs luffy
Ho yea Megatron vs freeca
I don't know if electricity is Alex's weakness but in the Robert Cross fight if you try to grab him he will stun you with his stun baton and in game Alex is clearly seen to be affected and immobile for 3-5 seconds. And since Cole's primary power is lightning, I think we know who the winnings going to be.
After frieza vs megatron pls do senator armstrong (metal gear rising revengeance)vs hulk (marvel)
Can someone do a Death Battle between Cole MacGrath vs Raiden (Mortal Kombat 1). The reason I say this was because Raiden and Cole can use Electrokinesis. Also, the Raiden that battle Cole should be the human counterpart.
So Could There Be A Follow Up Episode of Delsion vs. James from The Sequels?
Freddy vs pennywise
Depending on which continuity Megatron they go with he might actually stand a better chance than you'd think, in some comics he's on par with bots that can easily wipe out planet's and had manipulated anti-matter and can basically send people into a black hole. He's also much smarter than freeza
Alex is bad ass and quite literally the apex of humans and mutant evolution but Cole is a force of nature itself and then some. Cole can consume and destroy all life if he wants or he can protect it all if he wants. Cole at one point is obviously able to freaking generate so much power he somehow can time travel… Alex is the genetic end to mankind while cole is the next evolution of life as conduits. And also yeah evil cole can consume and destroy all organic life within about a hundred meters of him quickly shredding Alex down to the atomic level…….
Here me out again Chucky vs Slappy
Why are my favorite video game characters always losing? 1st Kratos 2nd Vergil 3rd Doomslayer 4th now Alex Cole is also one of my favorites but i was Rooting for Alex. Same goes for the Vergil vs Sephiroth fight, i love Sephiroth but i love Vergil more. Whos next to lose hmm? Dante? Snake? Leon? Starkiller? Emperor Of Man? Wiz and Bommstick you guys cant keep doing this me.
Megatron vs Frieza?…. Why?
These were incredible franchises, I wish they never got canceled
If this goes off good karma Cole, why did he bio leach. It's a move that adds bad karma
C'mon. I like Cole, but ain't no way he pieces up Mercer. Especially Prototype 2 Mercer.
Punished snake vs Raiden  V vs Adam Jensen
I was thinking that alex mercer gonna win for his healing factor, even knowing that cole is more powerful he can't regenerate his body like alex, but I'm happy becuase infamous is my favorite game XD
We need a kakashi vs gojo
Didn't they already do this one? I swear I must be going crazy. I have seen these match upset before I swear
I thought Alex was gonna win
The music gave me chills while watching the fight. This was a very entertaining battle despite the gaps in power, it was still awesome to see these two go all out. ❤ I've played both games when I was a kid and this gave me such a nostalgia bomb. Seeing Alex's fist mode was the best that was my favorite weapon to use literal tank buster. 😂
I was actually rooting for cole magrath i actually have one of his tattoos his character actually made a certain impact on me on heroism
Please do  zeus from god of war  vs thor  from the  dark  world
Now do ken from Tokyo ghoul vs James Heller from prototype 2
Record of ragnarock Jack the Ripper, please
Dragonball & transformers are literally 2 of my top 5 favorite series ever. Having frieza vs megatron is absolutely INSANE. You are putting a robot against a person who could jus somebody who could jus destroy every thing that exists if he felt like it. Deathbattle y’all are so delusional when it comes to dragonball characters
Would love to see All For One from My Hero Academia fight Synch from X-Men
If it wasn't for Death Battle, I never would have found out about either of these games. But I have seen Cole's amp before.
Really want a sequel to the evil ending of Infamous 2 and also a sequel to first son good and evil versions
I got Infamous on my PS3 but I barely played any of it.
Also more trash rap
This matchup is so obvious idk how I haven't considered it before. On that note, will y'all consider Kerrigan vs Jean Grey?
Sukuna vs Madara
Damn... I figured that how it would come out..
When anti matter an matter interact it's all 100% conversion to energy so not sure why you say it's not theoretically possible when us humans can do it now.
es Broma verdad?.... Megatron vs Freeza? -_- es Muy Obvio que Gana Freeza por Mucho, y eso que no soy Fan de DBZ 🙄😒
So if Cole has similar powers to Shadow then should they fight next? Also I’m very excited for the next death battle between two of my favorite villains of all time Frieza and Megatron.
15:11 to 15:24 is so damn perfect for me.  Everything to Mercer trying to convince Cole that humans are just beneath them and they could rule over them ( Classic Villain right there ) and Cole just outright mocked him for saying so.  Easy Top 10 favorite Death Battles for me from that moment alone.
Megaton vs Frezia ? I wonder who will win ? 🙃my money is on frezia not beacuse I like dragon ball 😑in fact I don’t 😐I like transformers 😎but megaton vs Frezia is like goku vs Optimus 😐seems to me this battle is over GG 😐
Ok that was awesome, y’all cooked
Just thought about this…. Who would win? Broomstick or whiz?
I've literally been lobbying for years for a Skeletor vs Mumm'Ra and you're showing Megatron vs Freiza of all people?
These legends need to come back on ps5
Kratos vs sun wukon
Can you please do Godzilla vs king titan (Godzilla verse vs ARK)
Alex Mercer vs Carnage 😉
Do Desmond vs James next
This Animation wasnt that good tbh
In standard gameplay cole is an annoying ant to alex. But fair point i cant imagine alex beating the beast.
Knew who the winner was before they even got to Analysis. I've played both games and it was pretty obvious how much stronger Cole is.
This one was wild!
Predictable, yes. Awesome, also yes.
Shady Rays: Shadow Legends
Asura from Asura's wrath vs Kratos from God of war (or wukong)
Energy manipulation reigns king of all the super powers and that’s the bottom line because stone cold said so.
We need both of these games either re-mastered for the PS4/5 and Xbox or a totally new series to come out. Loved both of these games!
Alex can't die he will regenerate and seek revenge he always do lel
Ya know you guys really dumped on Mikey in the turtles free for all but you may need to revisit that considering he ended up outliving all his brothers in the last ronin. Just saying. That plot armor apparently wasn't bs.
10 years in the making, and somehow the wait was worth it. If you weren’t in one on these series’ fandoms, you cannot comprehend how badly we all wanted this fight. And I gotta say, I am very happy with the outcome (and winner).
in before they have not emptied their trash in 10 years is cuz beer bottles are recyclable, which probably makes up most of the office's throw aways given boomstick's drinking habits
Feel like this is one of the most even battles we've gotten, could have gone either way. Personally still think Alex should have won but I'm okay with it being as close as it was.
Anyone thinks that his story kind of reminds of Tokyo ghoul.
I'm waiting for this DEATH BATTLE! *Billy The Butcher (TheBoys)*  V.S *The Punisher (Marvel Universe)*
11:43 watch it at .025 speed theres an easter egg
Honestly thought Alex had this cause i honestly forgot cole can basically also absorb people
Honorable mention to Crackdown im sure besides Spiderman and a couple hero games this one is an underrated original.
How well does megatron scale to frieza
I think frieza gonna win,but what are megatons feats
We need a remaster of the Infamous games
all ima say is, alex could have killed cole twice by touching him and absorbing him
wait 2013??? BROOOOOOOO THIS COULD HAVE BEEN RELEASED THE SAME YEAR AS GOKU VS SUPERMAN AND BATTLE OF GODS!!!!!!! BEST FKINg DEATH BATTLES EVER!!!!!!! (My personal fave was GOKU VS SUPERMAN but now it is ALEX MERCER VS COLE MACGRATH)
A bit sad that alex lost this one but finally seeing this come to life after years of waiting is good enough
So “Alex Mercer” was the thing alien crossed with an edge lord
While I love the matchup, I didn't see Cole winning this at all off gameplay alone. What threw me off in your post battle analysis is that Alex is "notably slower". I'm pretty sure Alex casually runs 60mph through Manhattan, on top of his Canon Ball attacks which close the gap for most opponents. If we want to be nostalgic, Alex Mercer is really just a spiritual successor to the Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction game from PS2, and has very similar abilities.
They didn't even talk about coles  vampire abilities
I disagree with the outcome entirely, but very cool nontheless.
Remember: this is a ten year old script.
I was surprised at this outcome
ITS HAPPENING ITS HAPPENIGN
Alex gots that Ship of Theseus going for him
I swear if another Dragon Ball character looses.
I'm going to say this every time I see a death battle they still need to do Tarzan versus George of the jungle
Does everything feel a bit ... stiff to anyone else ?
FRIEZA VS MEGATRON!?!  ARE YOU NUTS?! Friza will win on the battle. Megatron isn't going well survived by Frieza's Death Ball.  Remember, DB and Transformers Fans!  Frieza destroyed Planet Vegeta with his death ball, while Megatron used laser rifle nearly destroyed Optimus Prime.  □□□□□  Megatron was almost killed by the Optimus Prime's final blow in G1 or Michael Bay  Frieza was almost killed by LSSJ Broly in DBS Broly Movie  □□□□□  Megatron is strong enough to lift the combination bot's weigh over tons.  Frieza will hold on to stopping Goku's Spirit Bomb (same as what happened to Kid Buu)  □□□□□  Megatron's cannon possibly kills any autobots or desciptcons, except for a giant size of Metroplex in Transformers Video Game  Frieza's ki attacks can technically kill Z-Fighters and many, no problem.  □□□□□  Megatron is the champion who dares to challenge against the mightiest Megatron before he goes raging through his energon.  Frieza has a lot of fighting experience when he meets the saiyans with his evil personality.  □□□□□  Frieza has multiple forms to surpass everyone's limits.  Megatron gets only one reformed into Galvatron after Unicron creates him.  □□□□□  Frieza's goal is to rule over the galaxy and take on many planets until Goku and others are dead.  Megatron's goal is to take over the cybertron and the human planet Earth until autobots are dead.  □□□□□  Frieza has no melee weapons. Only his martial arts and ki attacks. Including his dirty tricks.  Megatron has a few weapons, and all thanks to his being champion with fighting experience.  □□□□□  Frieza will win this Death Battle!
Psi Ops game guy vs dark sector game guy!
Kenshin vs yorichi
What about Cole vs Delsin Rowe (Infamous second son)
Kenshin vs yorichi
Wait what? Next Battle is..... WTF!?
lol Damn! Was seriously rooting for Alex cause he's so badass and easily one of my favorite characters. But either way this was a dope ass fight! Good job and I love the rap song going with it. Played both games. Like someone else said I love how this has an early 2000 superhero flick feel to it.
Nani?
Roxas vs Shulk
Man I believe this is the first time in awhile that a hero finally won over the villain lol
I literally just started playing prototype
Well, this sucks.
Finn the human vs guts
Wow, who knew the coolest badass death battle I have seen in awhile would be between two characters I had no idea of.
I figured Cole would win because he's a walking national disaster even with just his lightning. Though Alex is no slouch by any means, he wasn't gonna beat the Electric Man
truthfully forgot about prototype haha cool match up!
Yujiro from Baki vs.Fang of Metsudo from Kengan Ashura
9:33 That’s right Boomstick
Delson row vs James heller
Unicron vs Galactus for death battle season finale.
InFamous is still one of my favorite playstation games ever. I nought a playstation from a random kid and it came with it and boy was that a great game!
I remember requesting this fight years ago and said they were "the kings of collateral damage." I figured the easiest way Cole could win was by using bio leech.
I never thought I would see this one, this was such a big debate for gamers back in the day, I was a big inFAMOUS fan so I never played Prototype, but now after knowing the story, I'm convinced that similarities were too much of a coincidence and that the whole rivalry was manufactured to garner interest, anyway glad my boy Cole won, after DB I used to want is Cole vs. Static Shock, since it would be interesting how their powers only help instead of hurt the other
This was worth waiting YEARS for!!!
I was surprised by the ending. Electro vs Carnage was sick
okay but Freeza vs Megatron??? thats a bit weird lol
These two franchises need to make a comeback together
I feel cheated should’ve animated the evils fight with a short clip
Isn't prototype just Tokyo ghoul but darker?
Honestly I was expecting Mercer to win based on Regeneration alone, I didn't even consider the neuro-electricity draining aspect. Great episode!
Boomstick’s second ex wife married him for the achievement
I was literally about to hop in the poll to try to get Freeza vs Mewtwo back on.   I had no idea I wanted Freeza vs Megatron so bad.
6 - 4 so far. Next time, I'm kind of expecting Frieza to stomp Megatron into the ground. Especially if they use his new "Black" form from the manga.
Please do Pee Wee Herman vs Earnest P. Woral
Sometimes even the most cynical hero has to smite evil.
Can you do The Collector vs Bill Cipher (The Owl House vs Gravity Falls) next please?
Glad they knew Cole will win, Cole is ridiculously durable in infamous.
Take it huh? Thanks for the tip.
This makes me wish that both franchises and characters were still relevant today. Im gonna go play Infamous 2 now.
yeah, sorry, but Cole beating Alex is the Cappest Cap that has ever Capped in the history of Caps.
"Read minds like Gokus Muffin Button" made me unreasonably happy.
And we never got to see the pair compete in a swimsuit contest. A true shame.
Frieza’s going to melt Megatron into toasters
Frieza vs. MEGATRON!!!   Okay im going to call it right now Frieza is going to utterly stomp megatron.   Optimus prime facing off against the og gundam was small potatoes.
Been waiting for this for years
tbh, both of them should have just fought shadow the hedge hog. seems like a better matchup
Don´t know this two, but excellent content as always. The strongest characters so far, from what I've seen, are Popeye and The Mask. Why don´t you guys introduce them to each other?
Please stop taking sponsorships from HelloFresh, they're a known union buster.
Okay, I don't have a battle. BUT I have a fighter: Rimuru, from the slime manga/anime Do I like this fighter? No. But he has so many resistances and abilities that I can see him giving some work to his opponent, whoever it will be.
I love that you guys had a script years before this video existed
The little kid in me is so happy to see this fight after seeing these two franchises put against each other for years. Great episode.  I hope they get some new games
11:01 like scp-682
I’ve been waiting all my life for y’all to do this one, 🙌🏽
Corin vs pichu lol
I need Cole Macgrath VS Electro
"VIRUSES DO NOT STOP!"
I remember when these two games came out I only had xbox, so I bought Prototype. I remember wishing I could play Infamous.  Love the video but damn, Mercer's face @15:10 looks ai generated.
man ScrewAttack  was still a thing when both games were new   It be nice to have those old videos back on youtube
Thank you Death battle, You turned a Very bad day into a GREAT ONE. Go get him "Electric Man".
MUFFIN BUTTON
Great episode. Kudos to the entire team.
So will we have Delsin vs Heller in the future?
I wonder if Senator Armstrong could beat Saxton Hale...
I'm the alex most have won bottom
I only played InFamous, but these two series feel like mirrors of each other. Glad to see Death Battle do them Justice.
Krillin: Goku…did you just read my mind? Goku: Yahuh Krillin: How..? Goku: Muffin button Krillin: Wha… Goku: Huh?
Omen(kengan ashura) vs Baki
Totally disagree. Little man syndrome rears its ugly head yet again.
Yall should have done Alex Mercer vs Carnage
Jokr vs green goblin
Death Battles animations are getting better by the day
If you gave me a coin for every time a fictional character with electrokinesis powers appears in Death Battle and wins, I would have 4, which isn't much but it's quite curious, don't you think?
John Constantine v Rick Sanchez
Tigra v Cheetah  Blue Marvel v Mr.Terrific   Spawn v Ghost Rider
They use all of Cole's abilities and use Alex's abilities, which they remembered😳
rap... again
Screw the haters this episode was a 10/10!!!!!!
Oh god, the battle music is awful.
@:53 pause.
who tf thought Frieza and Megatron was a good matchup?
This took me back to 2012
❤ I can't believe you guys finally did it let's go!!!!!
Let’s get Chris Redfield vs Leon Kennedy!
Kratos v asura
Why tf are they doing Frieza vs Megatron now? First I know nothing about the feats of IDW or any comic Transformer and 2nd (which is a spoiler)                We know nothing of Black Frieza's full power.
There’s no way Cole is beating Alex
Freeza vs megatron is gonna be hype because you know someone is gonna try and call them out for misspelling frieza regardless of how they do it lmao.   Also because we all know frieza will wipe the floor the decepticon leader and it's not even gonna be close. Shadow vs. Vegeta 2.0
Freeza vs Megatron? I am sorry some PUNNY MACHINE isn't going to win that battle.
I love Infamous especially Infamous Second Son on the PlayStation 4. So seeing Cole go all out and with amazing graphics in a versus matchup was wonderful. Cool video. ^_^
i was never too invested in the who beats who debate. prototype was more fun so i liked prototype more. alex has a cooler design too. cole falls too in-line with the late-2000s-early-2010s trend of "stern man w/ buzz cut on game cover" and as a result looks plain and dated today
waiting to see Ghost Rider vs Spawn
If megatron wins the next death battle i would laugh so hard, but tbh i am not really a dbz fan myself.
Congrats great cap
Know your place cole even though you may have won
You guys should totally do Moby from BrainPOP in one of these fights lol
God I remember watching these when I was younger.
Could it be that this script was thrown out because of the Superman Vs Goku 2 rematch?
This battle was kind of terrible
Who here is still waiting for another infamous game or even a remaster?
Vergil DmC5 vs Sephiroth rematch will be awesome
This is the best 3d battle since AllMightGuy imo. Everything is perfect. The fight animation is smooth, cinematography is stunning, the music fits perfectly, the characters are portrayed excellently, the reason to fight makes sense, the fight feels even throughout and it leaves me wanting to watch again and again. Mount rushmore contender right here.
Those characters and their games are so old that no joke they are literally considered retro games right now, it just so happen that they are now the most recent retro games now.
i know a good battle liu kang ( mortal kombat ) vs fire lord ozai ( avatar last airbender )
Okay i can't take it anymore pull out the big guns i dare you goku vs saitama i will believe what you guys say
This was good, glad y'all dug this back up. I seriously want a new INFAMOUS game, a remaster or even a reboot of some kind.... Such a cool franchise.
12:56
Freeza will win the next battle.
Dude, when Cole starts absorbing the energy from Alex, does he eat his soul? Like there is a giant orb that leaves Alex's mouth and floats over to Cole's before the camera zooms out. That's awesome.
the biggest thing Alex mercer has going for him is his Insane stealth capabilities. his strength lies not in his outright destructive potential, but rather in his ability to hide and remain lowkey. had this turned into a game of hide and seek, im sure it would have been a totally different story. after all, cole has strength and regeneration, but there are somethings even he cant resist; and the blacklight virus (not mercers consumption) is capable of mutating into hundred of variants in moments. eventually, one would have gotten through.
Is there a link for this death battle champion discord?
Happy that both ballot winners turned out so good, hopes next's year is even better
You guys always surprise me with the results and then convince me when you explain the reasoning behind your decision. Going into this video, I assumed this would be a one-sided victory for Alex
I know Sucker Punch has moved on to bigger and weebier things, but I'd still love to see another Infamous. (I won't even bring up the furry raccoon of theirs.) I'd actually buy a PS5 for it, honestly.
Muffin-Button
Flawed. You list that Alex was resistant to electricity, but then during the fight you made it look like he was totally vulnerable to it. Then, all Cole needed to do was spike Alex into the ground to defeat him even though Alex did that to himself all the time without a scratch? Totally flawed.
I love the inFamous series so seeing Cole return from the dead for Death Battle and win made me really happy. Hell Cole as a character is one that holds a special place in my heart, one of my favorite protagonists in gaming. I didn’t start playing Prototype until a couple months ago and I eventually started looking into Alex when this matchup was announced after Gogeta VS Vegito and I realized why this matchup was so highly requested. I was pleasantly surprised to learn how much Cole and Alex have in common despite having different powers, personalities and use their power.
This was by far the sickest deathbattle put out. Major props to the animation team for crushing the assignment!
This edgy 2000s matchup was so 1337!
I like how you completely forget how powerfull exactly full Mercer are.  Cause we dont see it in P1, and only at the end of P2. Hes literally capable of transforming into an entity size of a town, or create clones, and there is no way Cole would be able to see the real one, cause WHEY ALL are real ones, even town sized biomass.  Yes, its true than beast far surpasses supreme hunter, but you somehow forget that Cole barely beats the beast while Alex completely devastates hunter while still being in his imperfect form.  Whey also both share one thing in common - whey each have counter to opponents powers, and a weakness to them at the same time. The only real weakness of mercer is energy, but he has so much options to decieve or confuse his opponent, while also having much more expirience and brain power.  Cole howether relies mostly on energy atacks, howether hes weak to non direct confrontation, and phisical damage whitch is... yeah, Alexes primary metod of atack.  Cole is faster and thats a fact, he is howether only a little above human in terms of durability to phisical damage.  Alex is slower, howether not that much as he is still outspeeds normal humans tens of times, and also almost immortal. I mean, the whole plot of prototype 2 is the fact that even nuking this man would do NOTHING. He is beatable only by the one thing - the one like him, whitch Cole is not. Yes, it IS possible to kill mercer with Coles powers, but this requires Alex to concentrate all cells and virus he has into one body, and do not split it when he will feel danger. Both of this things he will not do, and its absolutely clear.  In this matchup i believe Cole loses like 9 out of 10, just because of difference in survivability and expirience.  Yeah, whey both can be a destruction incarnate to masses, whey seem to be alike in powerscaling, and Coles destructions potential are even bigger, but in the real fight, unless something speciffic yet random happens, there is no way he snatches this away from Alex. Cole has literally no means of killing real alex while Alex has shitload of options here. Ah, and yeah, its true that alexes consumption isnt a instant thing, but who said that target of it can move or act freely? Your cells and body are being devoured and rewritten. I think it hurts a lot, and even if you dont pass out instantly, there is no facts to suggests Cole could use his powers at this moment, considering virus spreads instantly to all body including brain.  As for an Evil Cole a believe its to be 4/6 with both cabable of taking 6. I mean there is clear difference of power here, but i dont know Infamous enogh to completely scale this. So one of them clearly stronger but who? Mercer can easly survive a blast from a beast... But multiple? Dont think so. Howether he could easly outlast beast by hiding underground, and as beast are very big target, mercer could probably infect him without him even noticing. Aaaaaand hes gone. Now were having living thinking immortal biomass size of a town whitch could shoot energy blast capable of leveling one as well. GG humanity lol.
BRO I ASKED FOR THIS DEATH BATTLE YEARS AGO IN A COMMENT
Warhammer 40k
Eldar
Finally ...waited for this since channel came out
This 7th on trending
please  Superman vs sentry
This animation went so hard. We are eating GOOD
It's been a long while since I've enjoyed a good death battle. This episode was absolute heat😆👌🏾!!! And thank you soooo much for the battle being 3D models and not pixels. I mean I like the pixel battles but not all the time please🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
please  Superman vs sentry
Calling it, Planet destroying Frieza wins.
please  Superman vs sentry
i still think we need a fight between bakugo and mustang.rage VS rage. i think bakugo wins it but i think mustang has some ways to win.
Team evil Cole
Another Son Wukong video when?
Awesome sauce
Here's what I think good Death Battle. Coleman won, enough said.
I suppose Cole deserved the win, and it made sense as to why he won... but man do I wish Alex had gotten the victory. In the Infamous vs Prototype rivalry of old, I was an Alex Mercer guy all the way.
Hey, THE LEGEND HAD RISEN FROM THE PAST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I mean SERIOUSLY! THE TWO LEGENDARY FIGHTS HUST HAPPENED THANKS TO DEATH BATTLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  JUSTICE ALWAYS WINS AND ALWAYS PREVAILS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I never thought I’d see Infamous on the trending page. Brings a tear to my eye.
I have the best death battle ideea a battle royal between the ex wives
After seeing this, can't wait for the day I see a Death Battle starring Delsin Rowe. :)
Since we're doing old matchups that never got made. I still want to see Aang from Avatar the Last Airbender vs Captain Planet.
Kuroki Gensai vs Yujirou Hanma
"We can make this a better world." should have been answered with "That's what I'm doing."
That fight was awesome sauce!
mom can we have eminem?   we have eminem at home  eminem at home:
I’ll be honest- I thought Mercer was going to win here, since years ago someone pointed out to me their differences in regards to taking damage-  Mercer survived a city leveling nuke and can near instantly recover from firearm damage  Cole could be killed by a single RPG hit
But on the other Hand could Cole actually defeat Alex after all ?!? Alex has immense self healing powers and could regenerate from every human the Blacklight Virus ever infected. I mean Alex was literally immortal due to the fact that virus could just transfere Alex Consciosness into another body
Great but I think we're all waiting for the clash between the Hunter of Yharnam and the Tarnished. Two great god-killers of two great masterpieces
I thought this was gonna be a wash in the other direction Glad i was wrong
I think as infamous is actually part of the DC universe would love to see a show based on it
Gojo vs kakashi!
I remember having this exact argument as a kid, this brings back memories lol Also Megatron is fucked lmfao
Freeza vs megatron ? Huhhh freeza clears this not even a fair fight
You gotta do gokai red vs Kamen rider decade!
I wanted this battle since I first played these games years ago and now it's finally here.
I don't like this one. The only reason why Cole survived an atomic-scale attack was because it was exotic energy BS, and that's his whole shtick. Alex was surviving stuff that was physical and chemical attacks. I highly doubt that good Cole could survive having his head chopped off with the attack coming in the form of a super-sharp blade arm.
Finally, teenage me can finally procrastinate in peace.
No way
We gotta see a Killer Croc vs. Lizard (Dr. Curt Connors) Death Battle. That seems like a perfect DC vs. Marvel matchup.
this the most fire one ive seen
Half as long, twice as bright.
Can we see black cat vs cat women
So frieza versus a robot.   Lets see, black frieza beats ultra ego and ultra instinct, and frieza is so fast, he could rip the heart from megatron.  Ok, next death battle plz.  If you wanna do a world conqueror battle, bring darkseid back and have him face frieza.   Thats much more balanced
The fight could easily go the other way, but there is a difference between both on an average day and both of them at their peaks. Cole at his peak has a power output that is undeniable in raw power. Alex on an average day is Venom incarnate and that is always terrifying. I think 7/10 it would go in Alex's favor, but when they both put their all on the line you get this amazing Death Battle by Screw Attack.
THANK YOU SO MUCH! i loved the infamous series so much and i remember loving every second of playing them
Am I the only one who thinks Alex should win?
I mean even basic high voltage electricity was one of the few things that could hurt Alex. On top of all of Coles even crazier abilities it made sense for him to win. Still awesome to see two of my favorite characters fight after all these years.
Yeahh.. No as much as Cole has zaps. Mercer has blade.
Having played both games I feel like Alex felt way more OP than Cole did but I could see it going either way.
KENPACHI VS ZORO KENPACHI VS ZORO KENPACHI VS ZORO KENPACHI VS ZORO KENPACHI VS ZORO KENPACHI VS ZORO KENPACHI VS ZORO KENPACHI VS ZORO KENPACHI VS ZORO KENPACHI VS ZORO KENPACHI VS ZORO KENPACHI VS ZORO KENPACHI VS ZORO KENPACHI VS ZORO KENPACHI VS ZORO KENPACHI VS ZORO
Huh. Strange how they didn't do this battle back in 2013. But hey, they did it now.  Also, for some reason this, 2:06 made me laugh.
Dang. Actually late seeing this. It was a cool fight and can see why it was voted for. As for the next fight... I have so many mixed feelings on this. Freeza is my favorite villain and something tells me he's going to lose. 😢
Finally, two legends from my childhood dream are fighting each other after 14 years. WHAT AN EPIC MOMENT OF LEGEND THIS IS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

damn, I wonder what's next in Death Battle? hmm...what about Erazor Djinn vs Ganondorf?
Why are they so angry at this script?
This can also be titled, Sony vs Microsoft
Been waiting for this one for years!!!
At first glance I really thought this was an easy win for Alex Mercer not a bad fight, now this next battle... Frieza vs Megatron!?!?! this is another battle where you would think Frieza would get an easy win but knowing Death Battle they love to sometimes make fights where you would think one person wins but it turns out to be the other, I have no idea what to expect from this next one.
Psst hey Boomstick? That match was Awesome Sauce~😏😏😏
AWESOME SAUSE !!
13:30

Joel from last of us vs Sebastian castellanos from evil within please please please!!!
The death battle we have all been waiting for wish they brought these series back
Cole may have won this death battle, but lets all agree alex won the drip battle.
Dope! Dope! Dope!
So basically (healing factor wise) it was Cell v.s. Majin Buu.
RIP Megatron Literally no way he's winning right?
Day 5 of asking for Old man Kratos vs War from darksiders
Considering both of these are my favorite characters and easily my two favorite games from PS3 (inFamous 1 and 2 still being my absolute favorite game ever) I'm so happy to see this battle
I love death battle with old characters
I think evil Cole would’ve been better
The only thing unbelievable about this fight is the lack of US military interference.
I would love to see you guys make a Jonny gat (saints row) vs Trevor Phillips (GTA)
Upvote for the muffin button!
Both these games need to make a comeback to new consoles or just bring then to MK one or the other haha
I have to disagree with how this fight was playing out, but Alex most certainly should have, and did lose in the end. Cole doesn't have a defence for getting skewered, and it could have ended in an instant in Alex's favor. At the same time, Cole didn't really even need to touch Alex to wipe him off the board. Just rip all the bio electricity from his body and it's game over. Cole doesn't have any healing factor that I'm aware of, so this fight really should have ended in a single solid hit...or when Alex skewered him through the chest and destroyed the man's heart. If you really wanted to get technical, Cole ripping bio-electricity from Mercer would have actually been more effective than on a normal person. Since Mercer's brain isnt centered in his head but rather distributed and copied in every cell, a loss of functionality through his whole body would force a blackout and cease involuntary functions permanently crippling his healing factor and movements
Freeza murks UNLESS they use the more powerful versions of Megatron, in which he might body
I don’t know what boomstick was talking about. I quite enjoyed this episode. One of the best of this season. Can’t wait for the next one. Who will win?
bs
Love the fight, but the upcoming fight I already know they're gonna make Frieza lose
Sound track qas epic! Bravo!

Thank you death battle I felt like i was going crazy 10 years ago for thinking Cole had even a chance of winning.
This wasn’t just a good vs evil battle. This was an Xbox vs PlayStation.
Poor, poor Megatron next DB...
I would love a Pegasus Seya vs sailor moon deathbattle
This was way more hype than I was expecting.
A classic battle of good vs evil
Saw this ending coming.
Didn’t see that coming.
Gonna be honest I came expecting to watch Alex eat lunch while I eat mine, came away with a surprise. Tbh I'm glad it was an actual fight instead of free eats.
Frieza will destroy megatron
Hey how about Dantes Inferno vs god of war🤨🤔
I would like to see Blade from Marvel VS Rayne from Bloodrayne.  I think it would be a good match for halloween October
How's about a sequel to Cole Vs. Alex for a later season of DEATH BATTLE!? Specifically, with the protagonists of the game's sequels? Delsin Rowe (inFAMOUS: Second Son) Vs. James Heller ([PROTOTYPE 2]).
Gwen v atom eve was the one I actually wanted
Hey they are throwing a bone to dbz fans , aw that is nice of them
Awesome fight to the death. I knew Cole was powerful, but I didn't expect him to have so much durability and strength against Alex, but I'm glad that the post fight analysis was explained so well👍🏿
come on y'all are 6 years too late for this
Yes I'm done watching death battle

Watch Megatron somehow defeat Freeza whonat this point is easily multiversal.
The opportunity for cole McGrath vs. static shock couldn’t have been more missed…
15:10 WOW THAT LOOKS _AWFUL_  Edit: Scratch that, the animation of that entire fight was _AWFUL_
Cole also was a vampire at one point
i would like to see a GOLGO:THE PROFFETIONAL VS HITMAN: AGENT 47 <3
Also, I'd love to see Marvel's Sandman vs DC's Clayface. That would be hella interesting and entertaining at the very least.
WHY DOES EVERY CHARACTER I LIKE LOSE WHY JUST WHY?!?!?!
Frieza vs Megatron?!
James Heller vs Delson Rowe?? 👀
Star Wars vs Star Trek!!!!
I hope someone read this but how about a death battle between kirito (SAO) vs maple (BOFURI)
Frieza vs Megatron differences:  Frieza: - Conquered hundreds of planets - Can transform to other forms on his own - Only lost after Goku became a Super Saiyan  Megatron (If we're only going by G1): - Took 20 years to conquer Cybertron - Need assistance from Unicron to gain a new form - Constantly loses to Optimus Prime
thank you for the video
I like mercer more than macgrath, but I still enjoyed the fight nonetheless, animation was top tier
Next albert wesker vs deathstroke
Alex Mercer after eating 7 billion people from Heroes(tv show) Universe can be omnipotent like MCU!Thanos with all 6 infinity stones
Ainz ol gown(overlord) vs Rimaru tempest(that time i was reincarnated as a Slime)
Frieza vs megatron?? Really? 🤦🏽‍♂️💆🏽‍♂️
Loved the inFamous games. I got the inFamous collection for my PS3 when I got a PS3 late in 2013.
I did love this fight but I feel like Alex would be a better match up against venom like look at the 2 of them look at their powers.
I like all the callbacks to old episodes like “let’s end this debate once and for all”, and the legendary “that’s right, boomstick”
I knew Cole would win, but no one underestimated Mercer's vitality.
Cole McGrath vs static shock Let's go!!!
You either die the hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain
It's finally here
OMGGGG ITS HEREEE
This should've been over the moment they get into melee. Cole gets a huge blade through his chest and just shrugs it off? There's a lotta important things in your chest.
Next battle is.............interesting
Frieza vs megatron? Who came up with that 1 sided fight? Frieza should win that without even sweating.
Can Mercer really truly die? Not that he has a healing factor but he is a sentient collections of cells that retain his identity and he just clones himself into a new body. So even if he infected cole at end even once Alex still wins , cause pretty sure Cole cant disintegrate HIMSELF at a atomic level and reconstruct himself so if he got infected or even one of Alex Cells in him during the fight , he's done for in long run cause Cole did become a energy vampire as part of infamous DLC for a while.
Why not Albert Wesker vs Alex Mercer?
What games are they from?
I need a Luffy (one piece) vs. ______ I've been watching death battle for years and man.... you guys always deliver.  Lol the education is pretty dope which lets me kno if you did an ep on one piece i could get a lil mini movie of great ass kickery of it. I dont know much abt One peice but i just found out abt these gears 1-5 🤯 and im sure y'all could find a perfect cross-platform situation to entertain us with. Thanks for the mind melts as always
Hope one day we could see Rogue vs Delsin Rowe (Marvel vs Infamous). It’d be battle of the power stealers.
Honestly, I was banking on Alex's resistance to electricity and ice to be the deciding factor, alongside Cole having nothing that could get through Alex's defenses otherwise. Pleasantly surprised that I was wrong.
Freeza with an I vs Megatron????  The DB fan in me is curious as to how this is a contest.  The TF fan in me is just stoked
lol You guys don't need to pronounce the "TH" in MacGrath. Its more like a "MacGrahh"
Frieza vs Megatron, eh? Megatron is a goner.
This did not go the way I thought it would and I love it
Frieza vs Megatron is the next matchup? Well that should be interesting to see…😅
It even did the “mission complete scene transition” they did in the games- _fantastic_ detail.
The power gap was way to widealso I'm betting Frieza
I bet for the rematch it will be heller vs delsin
That song makes miss Chester .....
I love both of these games too bad they are underrated many people should play these games when given the chance they are amazing
damn i really thought alex had that
i wanna see Brock Samson vs Black Dynamite
i think lore accurate Alex vs Cole would be Alex just blitzes Cole as a regular human from behind. Like stabs inside him, then rips him apart as he absorbs him and his memories. He does that 99% of his interactions in both games. He even one shotted a civilian and absorbed him instantly as he was walking in the gameplay, the only reason why it takes so long is because they need to make it cinematic and brutal as possible for the people playing the game. He would also involve the whole city and spread his conciousness in every civilian, so he can just kill/absorb civilians mid fight to get stronger, or force them to participate.
Broomstick is funny af
i hope prototype comes back.
Thank God they actually took the time to go off facts and not bias with this one. Then again with how irrelevant the characters are now it's not the surprising. Also with less fans they didn't have to worry about backlash. However I do like Alex better than Cole but I agree molecular absorption is far superior to cellular.
In what reality does Megatron stand the tiniest sliver of a chance vs freiza? Largest stomp on this channel by far
Damn, i wanted Adam Wesker vs Mercer. But this was good!
The pronunciation of Coles last name is just wrong, I get it's an Irish name and these are Americans, but it's pronounced "Mack Grah" "Mic Grah" or "Ma Grah" either one of these is fine.
I've been wanting this match up ever since Prototype first released! 😊
.....frieza....vs megatron????......what???
love how the music has the perfect amount of 2000's edgy anime AMV energy.
These are getting lame. Where's DBX?! Less talking more fighting!!!
Amazing
I feel like there were alot more powers being ignored here the main one being that i feel its been overlooked but Alex mercer is the same guy who was able to survive much worse than what the mans did at the end of their fight even regenerating fully even if with just a sliver of his muscles due to the black light virus
If Kirby listened to Linkin Park... Lmao
Can you please do Zaraki Kenpachi. Maybe against Asura. I don’t know. Just want to see Kenpachi kick some ass.
Vergil DMC 5 version vs all anime swordsmans
garou next on death battle
I remember playing both of these games and the hype in them NEVER died down, I’ll be the happiest man alive if either of them get a new game out😩
Rick Sanchez VS Doctor Who
and cole didn't even need to use fire Now delsin vs heller lol
Truly the best YouTube channel out there
Can they really do Frieza when Black Frieza hasn't even shown its power outside of "It beat currently broken Goku / vegetta"?
Somehow i knew this fight would happen some day
we all know who winning next time
Rip megatron lmao.
I know this is a consequence of joining rooster teeth, but there are few things worse than scoring an action scene with music that has lyrics.  The only time it works is when some anime plays the OP during a final battle, and thats because it built up and earned the moment, which is a rare exception to this rule.  Any other way like this its just distracting and takes away from the action.
We need YUJIRO HANMA VS UVOGIN from Hunter X Hunter, that would be a good match to be honest.
В детстве на уроке истории дико офигевал, когда рассказывали про князя владимира и то как он кровожадные дела делал, пока в мультике он был очень добрым
so....unless the comics gave Megatron some REALLY impressive feats, I do not expect the next death battle to go well for him
Damn that budget got cut real bad
Frieza vs Megatron 😂😂 really 😂
Deadshot vs bulleye
Fck yeah! 😎👍
Deadshot vs bulleye
fun fact alex was going to fight carnage back in season 5
My boi won!! What a great way to start the day!
Nice. Electro vs Venom!
I'm a big prototype fan but even I know Alex would lose, but I'm still sad my boy lost
Let's go great video!!!
I'VE BEEN HOPING FOR THIS ONE FOR YEARS!!  The result wasn't even the one I was expecting, but it was the one I was hoping for! I love inFAMOUS. And that fight was absolutely incredible from start to finish!
What's the name of the song while they were fighting?
18:32 Frieza vs Megatron?! Why?! That makes no sense!!!!! Why not just do Frieza vs Mewtwo, THAT makes more sense but your putting Magatron against Frieza?! It’s SO OBVIOUS who’s gonna win that fight (cough)(cough) Frieza!!!!! Like COME ON Death Battle, you didn’t think about using Mewtwo for this fight?! I’m disappointed in you Death Battle you really went down with this one, you would’ve been just fine if you used Mewtwo instead. But no, you had to use “Megatron” of all people!!! Why?! Why him?! It doesn’t even work!!!! Megatron not even that strong, he’ll lose compared to Frieza (so it wouldn’t even BE a fight in that matter) cause Frieza would OBVIOUSLY WIN!!!!!! 👎👎👎🤨🤨😠😠😠😠🙄🙄😒😒😒😒
This a battle I actually agree with. I thought they were going to hoe Cole. But they made the right choice.
The match up is what I have been waiting for
Who let boomstick in the writers room
But would Cole also beat James Heller?
Wish it, want it, I knew Killua would win
I AM SOO HAPPY COLE WON I ALWAYS KNEW HE WOULD WIN FOR 10 years now
Next time be like: Starscream: Dicepticons megatron has stub his toe im your new leader.
Please do kang vs booster gold
When are we getting a Crysis death battle
THIS IS BS! ALEX MERCER WILL WIIIIIIN!,!!
Im glad they delayed the fight up until now so they could justice the fight animation. Well done animation team!
I dont know why but i feel like they were insulting Cole and Alex by comparing them to other characters.
Raiden vs tanjiro Please, my teacher is a Tanjiro fanboy and he doesn't accept that no Metal Gear Rising character beats him
I REMEMBER COLE
Raiden (metal gear rising)vs tanjiro
This was totally badass love this video y'all made fun match 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Death Battle: "THERE!!! We did it! Now STOP ASKING FOR IT!!!"  Also, I don't know much about Transformers, but in what universe does Megatron stand a chance against Frieza?
YESSSS BOTH MY CHILDHOOD THANK YOU DEATH BATTLE
I'm so glad you got this right for a change because I honestly thought that you were going to hand Alex the win.
What? Next time Frieza vs Megatron?!🤩
Natsu vs Sabo please death battle you are the best👍💯
Great Fight! Nice animation! A job well done.
I had a feeling this was gonna go hard, but THIS hard? Like, seriously, this was so utterly awesome in every conceivable way. The writing, the action, the line deliveries. What is up with this season being so fire?
I was rooting so hard for Alex hes such a badass man 😢 both of these characters are one of the most underrated along side niko bellic
Please do Ryo Saeba vs Golgo 13
thank you so much for making this video not only do i love death battle but these two worlds were my favorite growing up i love them so much
I remember showing prototype to cousin once he asked "how do I kill?" truly lost for words I just said... "X jumps"
Lynkin Park Kirby got me. I had to pause for a minute to compose myself
We need a new prototype and a new infamous game
Ion know if frieza vs megatron is “ fair “
Great death battle between Cole Macgrath and Alex Mercer. I would like see a death battle between The Dark Raven from the Armored Core game series and Voltron from the animated series
That battle was badass
Просто потому, как Мерсер на протяжении всего боя щемил Коула, было понятно, что последний победит.
Alright, how on earth is Frieza Vs Megatron not going to an extermination??
Devilman vs chainsaw
Awesome the next death battle is gonna be on my birthday
Of course cole would win, he's earned a spot in play station all stars battle royale.
I prefer yahtzee death battle of these guys
They got so many things Alex would have won guess Mostly  Due to his generation witch  would have been a Problem
Finally the debate comes to a close. I can now sleep in peace.
Freakazoid vs The Mask plz
Captain Planet vs Avatar Aang plz
Please I’m begging y’all to do Omni-Man vs Kratos please😂😂
Sry but did sakuya vs homura is really happening? I see it on death battle wiki but i can't find the episode
\*Sees the next death battle\* Pitting a giant robot agaisnt a villain from a setting where people _casually_ blow up planets? Goodbye Megatron, we hardly knew ya.
Oh i just had a thought max steel vs gen rex
There have been a lot of times when I wasn't in 100% agreement with the outcome of one of these, but I think this one hit a new level. infamous is a better game by a lot, but Alex is on a whole other power level from Cole. Alex was wiping out entire military bases when cole was fighting for his life against like 6 dudes. Alex has him one upped on basically everything other than range, which is a gap he can close rather quickly. Again, I'd rather play through infamous again any day of the week over Prototype, but I think this is the first video I've seen where the result just feels wrong.
I've waited for this one for so long- since the original debate on who was the strongest between my literal two favorite video game characters of that time.
Trevor Belmont vs Van Helsing
Broly Vs Jiren
Megatron and freeza in next one? Not much of an even battle. lol Megatron have better luck going up against someone from megaman universe, another version of himself, or some other anime that doesnt involve characters blowing up planets or mountain ranges with their fingertip.
Eh I like cole but I truly think Alex would have won
Freezer gonna win that's one are easy
Alex mercer would win if he had his fp
finally
Prototype is still a better game so oh well.
can you do a battle between yujiro hanma (baki hanma) and tokita ohma(kengan ashura and omega)
LESSSSSSSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!! My boy Cole still got it Like for Infamous to get a new game on PS5 in 2024
Next season we need a Kratos vs Dante Alighieri (Dante’s Inferno)
Frizea vs Megatron omg I don't know anything about Megatron lore but if they and black Frizea transformation Frizea wins
I have been waiting for this since 2003 yes that is before either series existed
All I can say is _FINALLY_
Now that with a cool death battle
Animation was so awesome ❤
Really unexpeted ending. Thought this would be a real challenge for cole because of the healing factor and absorption powers. Th animation and music was insane and very entertaining. Good stuff!
This makes me nostalgic for the time I played Infamous for the first time, not to mention the golden years of gaming back then, at least for me
frieza vs megatron? im pretty sure this isnt a challenge for frieza unless there are things about megatron that idk about.
This fight was done right- im glad they used Cole(Good) than Evil Cole
😑 . . . Between the seasons, or some big enough break, the ‘movie’ of when Wiz & Boomstick first met, & then fought, each other: _Death Battle: Origins_ . Despite this movie intended to be as entertainingly predictable, or more entertainingly predictable, as _Star Wars_ , its more than just Wiz vs Boomstick, its also the Helicarrier (Marvel Comics) vs the Delphinus ( _Skies of Arcadia_ ), Smurfs vs Pikmin (self explanatory), & the VF-1 Valkyrie ( _ROBOTECH_ ) vs a F-14 Tomcat Striker Unit ( _Strike Witches_ Franchise)…
I'm glad the hero won. :)
Definitely wanna see an evil cole one now
i'm calling it before I watch Alex Mercer got this in the bag being effectively immortal with his absorption ability all he needs is a fatal blow and it's curtains for Cole
Not gonna lie when I saw Cybertron  I thought we were finally gonna get Unicron vs Galactus
GTVflyers to find out what's really going on.
Gotta say animation was lacking today
That linkin park inspired song in the background slapped.
Fellas, I've been waiting for this match up since these games released and you made it happen. Thank you.
Shoulda put him up against star killee
GENOS VS ANDROID 17 PLEASE!!!
Man, one of my dream battles that I never thought would happen! Thanks for taking so much care with two games that I absolutely love 😁
Amazo (dc) vs nimrod (marvel)?
I have a winner, He's name is Cole MacGrath.
I don’t know why Ant-man could use his ants why couldn’t Alex use the infected that he creates and controls?
Frieza can destroy planets that robot stands 0 chance😂💯
Frieza VS Megatron for next Deathbattle? Megatron's gonna be megatrash...
This was a great battle. I was sure Cole would lose. But soooo glad he won. Absolutely love the Infamous series
They only gave the win to cole because he had a choice of being a good guy! Alex can regenrate from almost nothing and survived a nuke Cole died from a nuke bomb? Ehh i guess lol😂
Lol, Frieza vs Megatron. That's gonna be one of the more one-sided contests for sure.
Now that's a certified good Karma moment.
Who tf are these guys
“Nothing will save you from me. Not men, not weapons, not ARMOR!” Alex Mercer in Prototype  I thought he was going to win but Prototype 2 happened haha 😅
12:48 Battle starts here Also, I like how Wiz says "Let's end this debate once and for all!" instead of "And we've run the data through all possibilities!" pointing out further how, the script for this episode was from all the way back in 2013.
This new death battle between two mutant anti-heroes is amazing
best soundtrack of any video u guys have made so far lol
Prototype was  phenomenal and i still enjoy playing
Going on my list of the best fights with good music
Both of these games were a blast to play, and I'm glad you guys brought us along on this trip down memory lane.  I wonder if there are any more scripts that have been put in cold storage until the world needed them most... LIKE SHADOW THE HEDGEHOG!
Zena vs Wonder Woman
DEATH BATTLE! : The next death battle will be Frieza Vs Megatron  Me: ALL HAIL MEGATRON!
Honestly didn’t expect Cole to win
I really wanted to hear the scream from the preview as Cole is thrown .
Hell yeah cole the man ❤
"The only one who can defeat Cole Macgrath, is Cole Macgrath; and he's been trained, by Cole Macgrath"
Except that Alex would win, not because he is stronger, but because he can make himself stronger.... He would just need to eat several conduits and Cole would not be even a remote match to his now greater power... There are plenty of those he could've consumed... Using end game forms without accounting for their abilities is pointless... Alex might be weaker than Cole while side by side, by he is much more powerful in the context of his he gains power... Set him free in Cole's city for a day or two and he would have a few hundred new powers.
I think it's funny how boomstick keeps making fun of the original script they had for the episode all the way back when the channel was still screwattack and the two weren't funny
It's been so long to hear Wiz saying "Let's end this debate once and for all".
Muffin button 😂
About friggin time.
Crocodiel vs sand man
I understand why people wanted this match I really really do but ive said for years that Mercer vs Wesker would be the better fight because Cole was just so far ahead
Loved this, waited so long for this matchup 😊
Do all assassin creed like you did in mega mans
Cole clearly has the advantage here... By a staggering 3-1!   Because he's more like Shadow the Hedgehog
I feel like they didn't want to do this and i feel it's as they said too little to late
The nostalgia 🎉
just glade mercer is finally in death battle  Alex Mercer vs carnage next please
Frieza vs megaton is a stomp no?
Megatron... vs Frieza?
Damn, these new death battle writers need to chill  The old scripts they had were much funnier and it feels like they’re trying to overcompensate for the lack of humor now
Please give us Travis Touchdown vs Scott Pilgrim (No More Heroes vs Scott Pilgrim VS the world)
Naaah I think Alex would win. He just seemed way more powerful than Cole in the games.
Asura vs kratos when?
So whose the genius who thinks megatron actually stands a chance against frieza? He doesn't.
I’m glad my favorite won but it feels kinda lame considering how bad the animation is and how the killing blow was kinda shallow. Absorbing the bioelectricity was neat but then they just sorta hit the ground really hard and cole is the winner. I would’ve preferred he actually use one of his specific powers like his continuous lightning strike that has been used in his actual games as a finisher for bosses.
Cole CONDUCTed Alex’s funeral
Its here its been years and months from now next will be venom vs alex mercer or symbiote spider man vs alex mercer
Do Stewie Griffin vs Rick sandchez ( family guy vs Rick and Morty )
ALUCARD CASTLEVANIA VS SEPHIROTH
Jesus Christ this was amazing
Yeah What would happen if alex fought the Evil cole instead?
Damn I miss the live...
Black Dynamite vs Shaft
The first thing I though when I saw Frieza vs Megatron was: "Wait, Megatron is Universal?? 😂"
Like I said before, I knew this would be an epic battle. Really enjoyed this one, especially these characters from the 2000s.   I also have some recommendations. Optimus Prime (Bayformers) vs. Eren Yaeger (Attack on Titan) and Gipsy Danger (Pacific Rim) vs. Strelitzia (Darling in the Franxx) (Or anyone else really)
I have been waiting since 2009 for this
Death Battle Company Really Earned Success.. I mean they always Got Sponsorship GOD Bless you more guys with your fun Job
Gojo vs accelerate next death battle
These two where such a Blast, saved me from boredom during a good chunk of Highschool.
I thing they should do persona vs jojo
*Kat from Gravity Rush for the next Death Battle please!*
Nice little dbz abridged referance. Muffin button. Ha
Im kinda afraid of next one. Im a dragon ball fan, and thus far it was not lucky in death battles
Sure put a solar system destroyer, super powered alien  against a robot. Please don't make him golden Frieza. The battle should go on for more than 30 seconds.
Frieza vs Megatron!!! Yes boi!!!
Maaaannn I disagree with the results so harrdddd but it was dope seeing my 2 favorite game franchises in a death battle. This was a first for me 😅
Honestly thought Alex would win?? Happy to see the good guy win!
One punch man vs Superman would be awesome.  Superman vs Omni man would be interesting too. besides Superman one million vs idk who can withstand that hahaha
18:21 Two of the greatest villains from both Hasbro and Anime! 🤩
Do Leon in RE4 vs John Wick
pls Death battle megatron vs freiza we know who will win its frieza because he literally merciless and evil and megatron is also one but just wanted to save cybertron and we do know who will win obviously
Alex Mercer is stronger than Cole
As a kid I thought it'd be cool as hell to have "prototype" powers 😭.
I was half expecting this to end with Cole using time travel just like Kesler did and killing off the human Alex Mercer before he even made the Blacklight Virus.....or would that have just resulted in multiverse theory bs?
Damn yo I didn't think they'd let my boy Cole win this but I'm happy
Can Cole beat Heller then ?
Better than most actual superhero movies these days, in both characterisation and action.
"Macguffin blew up in my face" is the origin story of one of my D&D characters.
Hey guys who would win in a fight. The Ring Girl (Sadako/Samara) or The Grudge Girl (Kayako)?
Ahhh death battles have been keeping me entertained since 7th grade now I’m 24
Frieza VS Megatron next huh? This seems like a massive mismatch on paper, but I get the feeling that Megatron is probably extremely OP in comic continuities?
I have a good idea Asura vs kratos
This was cool. And death battle if your reading this please do Waybig vs Ultraman
Kunagawa vs Bill cipher
I love how the camera pans back to a video game 3rd person view at the end, like we just finished a bid battle cutscene and it's back to gameplay now
I love that this script is so old, they're using lines like "let's end this debate once and for all" and "That's right, Broomstick!" Make it feel like a DB time capsule.
Which one are you a fan of?
*Possible minor spoiler alert, keep scrolling*  …  …    What if they had included Cole’s vampire form in this video? I wonder if that would’ve done more good or more harm.
this death battle stands out for me !!!! loved it
Megatron is fuuuuuucked. Not even galvatron would stand a chance.
This was the best db animation I've ever seen.  It's kinda of sad Alex didn't use the city to his advantage, boy's a one man army but fought one on one instead
Cole got it❤️ He got it
Goku's muffin button... really Wiz 😅
Frieza vs Megatron-...this will be interesting
Megatron needs to up his game.
Damn, I was really expecting Alex to win, but I guess Cole being able to negate his healing AND destroy Alex on the molecular level is fair.
Dude mind Blown idea 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 | ALIENS Vs. TREMORS
How about the kid from infamous second son vs the dude from 'the darkness' games on xbox
Since they finally did this, I'm hoping more niche characters get fights... maybe Kat from Gravity Rush will get some love 😅
Matt Mercer? I knew it.
Can we get a death battle with Infamous Second Son: Delsin Rowe
I miss this gaming  era
Muffin button!!!!
Mr Hanky (South Park) vs Mr Popo (Dragon Ball)
Nope I still believe Alex would win
Been HOPING for a Death Battle between these two for years!! Mercer is rad af (and I would rather have his powers tbh) but I will always stand by my man Cole ⚡😎
BT-7274 VS Raven 621
Absolute nonsense. Alex would have absorbed his ass in seconds!
Great battle these 2 came out almost at the same time i think . And Friza vs Megatron?! , does not sound like a fair battle, i vote Megatron Vs the Iron Giant
When are you all going to do Jhin from League of Legends vs Mista from JoJo part 5 though?
Gotta be one of the best DB this season, for these reasons:  1. A fight between 2 video game characters from awesome games.  2. 3D animation  3. Good vs Evil  4. And a badass song to go along with it.
that was the worst conclusion i have ever seen.... how would cole do anything to him? mercer was faster and stronger and had the ability eat him within seconds?
The Fight was amazing but i had some questions:  I don't think cole's radar pulse is much of a factor as james heller has a similiar version of it so i assume alex has it too. That evens the playing field. Alex should be able to react to ice because lightning is faster than ice. The setting just coincidentally put cole near a lightning tower but alex nowhere near living organisms for extra biomass.  But yeah, cole still wins.
I love when the hero prevails over the villain
17:45 SPOILER WARNING FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN THE VIDEO AND WANT TO DO NOT CLICK READ MORE OR THE TIMESTAMP OF THE VIDEO.                                    One of the evil choices in 1 has Cole use the Ray Sphere to boost his power up even more. That plus the power he gets from the Beast? Alex wouldn't even be a stain if he fought Evil Cole.
I don't care who gonna win. Im just here for the 2000's nostalgia
Sorceress Ultimecia vs Kronika (Final Fantasy vs Mortal Kombat)  Big Boss vs Punisher (Metal Gear vs Marvel)  Bahamut vs Nicol Bolas (Final Fantasy vs Magic the Gathering)
we need a sequel from their games
That music was nice.   Anyway, I cannot see Freeza losing when we do not know much at all about Black Freeza.
If second son gave us that paper power at the end of the dlc I'm 100% sure we'd have a third son by now trust
Cole should have been matched against Railgun
The outcome became obvious ever since both games had their sequel out. The Beast > Alex Mercer.
I don't know how cole won this fight. Alex is stronger & faster, and absorbed every person that has something viable to give in a fight. Cole didn't actually beat kessler..lol. And got stomped by the beast not once, but twice. That impact at the end is also stupid. Alex survived a nuke, that slam was block level at best. And cole just so happen to have piece of alex in his hand at the end. sure. This fight is very biased. Nobody even questions this stuff because people love infamous. Also the bioleeching is for evil cole, not good cole. That is a evil karma action. I still think alex stomps cole. Cole doesn't even scale to kessler, you know the guy that could actually kill the beast without the RFI. That also stomped him out. Now all of a sudden cole is "faster" than alex. The man that has to climb buildings slow as fk & running down the street slow as fk. While alex can casually run down the street & buildings in seconds. Alex also fought way stronger bosses. Cole couldn't win against any of the high tier enemies in his game.
I'm kinda pissed that infamous won
Man who thought Frieza vs Megateon was going to be a good battle. This is so one sided it hurts
Next ep being Freiza vs Megatron... I wonder if they'll go with DBZ Freiza, DBS Freiza, or DBS Manga Freiza?
So we not talking about Frieza and Megatron?
wait hold on, aint there an infamous DLC where cole is turned into a vampire? dont that mean he can get infected more easily then we thoughts? am confused
THIS WAS AWESOME!
Frieza vs megatron?!?!?!?!?!?! That’s frieza easily
Seeing Alex reminded me of Eve from 'Parasite Eve', and I thought that it might be interesting to see her in a Death Battle.
I'm curious to see what they'll do about the size difference with the next fight. It won't be on the same level as SpongeBob vs Aquaman, but still
*FRIEZA* Vs *MEGATRON* for next time?!? Megs gonna get WASTED!!! 😂  ALSO:     Mathew Broderick Godzilla Vs Jack Black King Kong  Goku Vs Superfriends Superman(Dragonball Vs Superfriends) Starfire or Supergirl/Powergirl Vs Captain Marvel - Battle of the cosmic warriors Wasp Vs Bumblebee DBX- battle of FEMALE shrinkers Galactus Vs Unicron - battle of galactic giants  Black Cat Vs Catwoman - battle of catsuit clad babes  Wonder Woman Vs Captain America - battle of star-spangled heroes The Mask Vs Beetlejuice - battle of the body morphers Power Rangers Vs Voltron 2 - give Power Rangers a better Megazord Power Rangers Vs Sailor Moon Power Rangers Vs V Force Indiana Jones Vs Lara Croft - artifact finder Vs tomb raider Scarecrow Vs Mysterio - Illusion battle Alucard(Hellsing) Vs Alucard(Dracula) Gremlins Vs Critters Mr Fantastic Vs Plastic Man Beerus or Broly(DBZ version) Vs Superman(DB VS DC) Alucard(Hellsing) Vs Dante(Devil May Cry) Hawkman Vs Birdman (DC VS Hanna Barbera) Ichigo Vs Yusuke (Bleach Vs YYH) The Tick Vs Freakazoid(FOX Kids Vs Kids WB) The Tick Vs Rhino(FOX Kids Vs Marvel) Jenny/XJ9 VS Spinnel(Teenage Robot Vs Steven Universe) Bobert Vs Robot Boy (Amazing World of Gumball Vs Robot Boy) Power Rangers Vs Ronin Warriors
I played Prototype, always loved the fact you could do a free-roam all the while they don't pester you with objectives.
Symbiote Vs Mutant The Game
Frieza got it
Aww, no ZP-inspired lingerie section?
OH MY BLOB FXXKING FINALLYYYY L
I really wanted Alex to win, but I can’t argue with facts 😞
I use to think of this scenario all the time when i was younger. I loved playing Infamous so much and Prototype was such an awesome sandbox superhero game.
As a fan of both games I’m actually satisfied with this battle
Wow, they really out here trying to have a no contest for the next one. And I’m saying that with Megatron being one of my favorite characters of all time.
How does a bullet have more energy than a tnt,shouldn’t the tnt have more energy cause it’s mass is more
I was aware of these characters but never played the games. But as soon as they said "manipulate electromagnetic fields" I was like... okay, so he's gonna curb stomp.
Cuphead vs sans please
Y’all must be smoking that Pilaf pack to put the ultimate racist against Foddertron. If megatron wins this might cause worse controversy than goku and Superman’s fights
Alex was a broken hero in the end
Frieza vs megatron 🤣🤣🤣🤣 not even close
Not a huge DB fan. Does Freiza have anything that can destroy Megatron?
Honestly I think Megatron should be paired with someone else. He has absolutely no chance versus freeza.
Why does it feel like the song was sung by Eminem
I might have a problem because mid way through the battle I thought wow I wish I could bet on the winner 😢 I need to be stopped
You should do TALION from shadow of war .
Is it just me, or is the animation choppier than usual?
This was amazing. Next one? Not so much.
Darckside vs Kane  The conqueror
This fight was TOTALLY AWESOME to the MAX, and the most RAD music🏂🏄🪂😎
Taking power, huh? Thanks for the tip.
Shadow the Hedgehog: "Finally, a worthy opponent. Our battle will be legendary!"
Damn the fight was epic. But frieza vs megatron why? Is that even an even matchup
Suggestion: Ed, Edd, n Eddy VS. The Animaniacs
Let's hope they have black Frieza in this next one, I kinda wanna see the scale of his power outside of the demonstration
I never play the infamous, but they didn’t say cole had a healing factor, and Alex like to slice and dice I think a huge blade going through him would do him in
yeahhhhhhh i loved this
And whose fault is it that you waited until long after the games were relevant to do something with them? Eh?
I knew Cole Macgrath will be victorious because mercer virus become weak due to fire as we seen in Prototype 2 & Electricity is freaking upgrade of fire
my new favorite deathbattle
Can you please add Gengar from the Pokemon versus King boo from the super Mario
It's Sony VS Microsoft's Activision Blizzard In The Great Battle Of The World Greatest Mutants From The Rivaling Video Games & Alex Mercer Loses With Cole MacGrath's Victory, And Prototype X Was Made After Alex Mercer's Death He Was Consumed By James Heller And Prototype X Was Made By The Mysterious Mastermind & Cole MacGrath Is One Of The Heroes
Espera esto no ya avía visto en batallas de rap del frikismo recordé mi infancia 😮😂
I have been waiting for them to make a video of cole macgrath and alex mercer fighting each other for a long time and great video death battle :]

That was fun. Love it!!!
Lmao cole would never beat Alex this is one of those videos based off biased votes
Been waiting so long for this!
YAMI SUKIHIRO VS GOJO SOTURO PLEASE
This was an amazing battle..I love both games.
Love these games- Wonder who would win between Cole and Delsin... Now that would be a matchup.
Pls Heihachi vs Yujiro  :)
nnnooo... the universe giveth (silver surfer my favourite comic book character) and the universe taketh away (my favourite video game character). This debate has been going on since the games came out... and since i have played both prototype games multiple times and begrudgingly played any infamous games i was always on the side of alex mercer... the fact that it went the other way i think is the most mind blowing result in death battle history...
Delsin Rowe vs James Heller
Cold didn't even need to transfrom to wim lol.
The lastest win for Sony since Ratchet & Clank vs Jak & Daxter.
Spy (tf2) Vs Agent 47  they both have insane hand to hand combat & good stealth so this would be a fair fight
As someone who's played the Infamous games but not the Prototype games, I was extremely satisfied with the results.
No matter who wins, I think we can all agree that Alex Mercer got that drip
What if Anos voldigoad fight against rimuru tempest
I knew nothing about these characters but after seeing their stories, I was hoping for cole to win. HELL YES
YEEEEEESSSSSS!!!!!! ANOTHER DEATH BATTLE JUST AS I PREDICTED!!!!!!
Frieza vs Megatron, October 9th.
Whoever wins, i am ok with it. I still love Alex Mercer though.
What About Video... Hank vs Neopolitan
If he pulled the dumbbells, he would beat him 😂😂😂
I miss InFamous
I want a new prototype game Imagine how it would look with modern graphics
Finally!!!!! Thank you!!!!!
Max steel Vs blue beetle now that's a worth while battle
Freza Vs Megatron come on this isn't even close freza destroys Megatron plus with his new form this battle couldn't be more one sided come on death battle get creative
Had to pause and post this. The music was wack and ruined the fight   Would’ve been better with just fight audio, not even gonna finish the video
i really thought alex would win gen rex vs alex science evolving vs nature im happy cole won count one for the heros
Yujiro hanma vs Mr. Satan
Prototype story is A great story and twist to play both Games but is literally a rated R venom game for anyone that’s never seen or played it oh and u play in New York…. I’m not gonna lie if we all took control of alex  I think we would’ve won. 😂
If i remember right this actually technically isn't the actual mercer but a kinda clone similar to ethan in re village
Baki dad vs the Tekken guy dad the main old man
Infamous for the win, let's gggggggggoooooooooooo
Cole fought a future version of himself. I would love to see Cole Fight the guy from infamous Second son, you also forgot that get vampiric abilities in the dlc
War (darksiders) vs Kratos would be a wild battle
The next fight is going to be a wash. Unless they want to pull a Kirby again.
Frieza vs. Megatron?!? I HAVE to see that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
When are we gonna get monkey d luffy in a death battle?
Why'd you have to put dancing McGuire in Cole's analysis?!
I would love to see starkiller in a death battle.
What happened to the RT intro? Why is it no longer there?
WHOOOOOO
Now do Megas XLR vs. Sym-Bionic Titan! That would be sick! 😎
Can honestly say i wasn’t expecting the line “can read your mind like Goku’s muffin button” lol
The only opportunity they missed is they didn't bring back the "FIGHT!" at the start of the match... Would have been a good throwback for this match
Why didn’t they do evil cole
Still waiting for Luffy...
One of the worst looking Deathbatles in recent memory (considering how dated the graphics are) but one of the only ones I couldn't predict early on from how well the back-and-forth was scripted.  Nice job!
IT’S HERE! AFTER 8 LONG YEARS IT’S FINALLY HERE
Carmelita fox vs. Loona ( Sly Cooper vs. Helluva boss)
I know I'm posting this a little late but could you PLEASE do Scarlett Witch Vs Merlin: Marvel vs Seven Deadly Sins
Cole earn my respect
ODIN VS ZUES
As someone who played both games, i expected Alex to win, but I'm so glad Cole did
No doubt guys to me was one of the most ICONIC fight i EVER seen on this channel Thanks guys for bring us Alex Mercer from Prototype i freaking love this character As always Death Battle never disapointed
Hercules vs Conan  Revan vs Anakin Skywalker
They should do a death battle with Starkiller/Galen Marek
Joker (DC) vs Desty Nova (Gunnm)
Best battle ever I'm always at team cole
I thought Cole had to weaken stronger ppl before absorbing 🤔  Alex wasn't weakened there...  And Cole can survive a stab through the chest? 🤔
two of my favorite game titles of all time. I love being a super hero or villian.
K but Delsin Rowe could take them both.
The music was so deep into the 2000s I almost drowned
What I really like about this fight is that Cole is basically a superhuman. And Alex is an absolute monster. They are very two different opposing sides. The hero, and the monster. And the score helps drive this point forward. I played both games. And i absolutely loved both games.
The infamous lost DLC
Is there some massive obscure feat for Megatron that even remotely makes this fair?  Ultra Instinct Goku and Ultra Ego Vegeta ARE BEYOND MULTIVERSAL at this point, and Black Frieza blitzed and one shot BOTH of them.  I highly doubt Megatron could even beat Raditz as couldn't even beat Shia Labeouf ROFL.  1st From Frieza wins this in his hoverchair with 1 finger unless Death Battle uses some massively obscure hidden comic feat to make Megatron way stronger than he normally is......
Aptom vs Cell and Hellsing Alucard vs Vampire hunter D
games today need more of the 2000s edge.
I'm glad we got two fairly equal fights in a row.
its funny that they didnt include cole’s ability to regen from draining electricity in his pro vs con chart at the end. they both can just keep regening haha
This DEATH BATTLE Was Crazy! Truly a Wonderful Fight of Cole MacGrath vs Alex Mercer NO WAY?! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!  Next Time is Going to be Frieza VS Megatron (Dragon Ball vs Transformers)
Is it just me or does no one remember that the evil ending in infamous 2 is the og canon ending and it only got swapped to the good ending because more people played good.
Cole is so cool
I'm sorry, but the next match-up is a no-contest.  The most powerful version of Megatron I know could barely devastate a city by himself, while Freiza commands multiple underlings that can destroy a planet with a wave of a finger: underlings who don't hold a candle to his own power.
This Frieza vs megatron fight finna last 30 seconds 😂
This was great, awesome fight
So… Unicron vs Galactus when?
Infamous definitely seems like my type of game. An awesome open world free roaming battle system with a moral system like spiderman web of shadows. Glad good cole was able to take down the anti-hero to villain Alex Mercer
**looks at the next matchup** ok, which version of Megatron are they gonna be using here? Because the original G1 version doesn't even come close to beating Frieza
The idea of Cole Mcgrath with Alex Mercer's powers as well as his own Conduit abilities is a truly terrifying idea...
What I find interesting about Alex is that in the end, he welcomed his death. He was alone at the top of the food chain, the only of his kind. He tried to make others like him, but they were pale imitations, better than humans, but worse than him. Yet, when Heller had Alex at his mercy, he realized he *did* succeed in making someone like him. Better yet, someone *better* than him. Unlike Alex, who had no reason to maintain his humanity, Heller still did. If Alex was the Prototype, Heller was the finished product.  "Welcome to top of the food chain" isn't meant to be rude, or even a compliment, it's a warning. Heller is going to be alone, like Alex was. He can try to fill that void with family and friends like Alex tried to, but even if Heller's family accepts him, he will likely outlive his own children and likely even grandchildren. He is at the top, and Alex could not be de-throned until something stronger came along. The same will likely happen to Heller. (Or would've if Prototype wasn't cancelled...)
Death battle brand identity is trolling at this point
Great episode! Too bad the DB curse can't revive Prototype since the studio that made it is as dead as hell.
Bruh it’s a crime that Alex lost 😭😭
The character I wanted to win so badly lost, I was always a bigger fan of their game series, but in the end I knew it was inevitable. I am content with this conclusion, even if it's bitter-sweet.
What a classic death battle
Wowbvery interesting, they dropped this after I voted in Imdontai’s poll about prototype and I even said that I believe Alex Mercer is stronger than Cole McGrath.
Cole who stole my name would have been better matched against Shadow the hedgehog Storm or lord Raiden. Being the coolest fighting another prototype. Mercer is essentially immortal as the virus cannot be destroyed only made dormant absorbed or evolved into another virus or host.
Frieza being in a death battle now is kinda weird timing since he now has his Black Frieza form and we’ve barley seen anything about it besides one shoting Gas and then UE Vegeta and UI Goku at the same and just leaving.
Still waiting for all of Boomsticks Ex’s death battle
Who else saw that clash of the clans Rube Goldberg video add 🤯
Cole McGrath is one of the best characters I have ever had the pleasure of playing as in any video game. Glad he got the W.
Ngl hearing that "let's end this debate once and for all" really brought me back, so much better than what they say nowadays
delsin rowe vs peter petrelli
That ending surprised me
Not fair. Alex cannot be defeated. He's the virus. But.... I didn't saw all his abilities in this fight.
I still say the arbiter vs the predator would be more interesting
Dude I like Alex, but GOD do I love heroes winning against villains in these Death Battles.
They going to job out Megatron... that's sad.
This was just a kid's dream back then, but seeing it now feels so unreal
Daamn, that was AMAZING!
I honestly think Frieza will win
Man, I would love another inFamous entry; those games were so fun and the world pretty interesting.
Cole can die from being shot. Alex absorbs all organic material. He literally eats bullets. This is from the lore of the game. Not only that. But were using prototype 2 Mercer who can literally control both the virus and its side effects. Cole still can get a cold. This was a favored match and one that doesn't make any sense.
Remember, Cole is the PRIME conduit.
Frieza vs Megatron? Seems like a curb stomp in favor of Frieza. Correct me if I'm wrong but Namek Saga full power Frieza could destroy planets with ease, heck, him at his weakest onscreen appearence in Bardock shows that same feat.  Has G1 Megatron ever shown that power output capability?  And is this ONLY going to be on Frieza upto Namek Saga or is gonna include up to Super with Black Frieza?
SANDMAN VS CLAYFACE??     (I just thought about this today seeing some lore clips on YouTube shorts about clayface today! I’m not sure if I’m an idiot for even questioning the result of this battle 😭🤣)
It’s it me or this fit so well like a hero vs villain (which basically what it is).
BROLY DBZ VS. BROLY SUPER two enormous powers with untapped potential I’m going at it will be raw
I wanted to say this in the comments of the Alex Mercer teaser vid but I’ll say it here instead: Wiz and Boomstick sharing random info about their personal lives feels like a new type of dad lore.
Just reminiscing this wonderful era of gaming , such a blast. Great fight.
if alex had not tried to consume cole and just pulled his blade upward he would have won
I hope we get another infamous game
This fight has better graphics than the actual games
I thought they had done this but look "11 hours ago" was posted.   You just try to play it once and it becomes popular. hehehehe
You what is funny is that the Marvel Spider-Man 2 game that is coming out soon kinda let's you play with these 2 powersets, electricity and tendrils lol
#3 on Trending, boys.  Bout time inFamous and Prototype get remembered again.
You ever notice that in the actual battle the first aggressor is usually the loser? Whoever throws the first punch loses
Dexter vs Jimmy Neutron otw?
Frieza vs Megatron?!? That makes no sense and other other is just as crazy strong as Saiyans... really what's a Cybertronian gonna do?
Hmm…dunno how much I agree with that conclusion. The two things that bug me the most are “how sure are we that the Blacklight Virus operates on bio electricity the way humans do” and how well can Cole keep up his charge to keep in the fight. Granted, I don’t know all that much from the sequel games, but I remember that being a bit annoying in inFamous; having to manage your overall charge as you go. Both characters had consume/recharge mechanics, but they operated very differently. Cole needed to consume electricity from other devices and such to sustain his power, which ran out as he used it. Alex consumed people, but it was more like consuming a health pack. His abilities didn’t exactly rely on regularly consuming people. Sure, he learned abilities from consuming specific enemies, but that was about learning new things, not ‘needs regular consumption to use’. The only power that really relied on that was the various ‘blast’ super moves. Not to mention that I’m pretty sure most of Cole’s more destructive feats needed another ray sphere to trigger, unless I’m misremembering. As in, he needed to be holding and using it as a tool.   Overall, I guess what I’m really getting at is, from playing the games, Alex generally felt more destructive and unstoppable to me.  Still enjoyed the episode, though, don’t get me wrong 😅
Baki vs ohma
Half as long, twice as bright
what about heller
That’s b.s Alex Mercer would destroy him
Great battle thank you ! BUT   Frieza vs Megatron … Wtf is going on here guys ?
Were the audio/music makers going for a 30 Seconds to Mars vibe/sound? If so? Goal achieved. Awesome sauce. *winks at Boomstick in DeadPool*
WOW as someone who never played prototype but heard of Alex I thought cole would Lose!
I just want to make clear, what they did to Mercer in prototype 2 was criminal in my view. Dude was nerfed to no end and should have been the main protagonist. I couldn't believe I had to consume him in the end, when all Heller had going for him was plot armor. Hopefully he's done justice with a proper reboot
Never saw infamous be relivent in a very long time. Still one of my favourite games ive ever played. Just pure fun.
Muffin Button
15:57 this was the moment when I knew Alex was going to lose u.u
Dragon Ball Fans : WHAT ! FRIEZA VS ! Transformers Fans : MEGATRON ! Death Battle : Yeah Why ? Look....... Bad Dragon Ball Fans : DRAGON BALL IS BETTER ! Transformers Fans : F#@% ! NO ! TRANSFORMERS BETTER THAN DRAGON BALL Z ! WEEBZ ! Death Battle : Oh Boi
Another surprising result. 😮
Honestly, I was thinking Alex would win because of his arsenal and regenerative factor and other sh*t but damn I was proven wrong and I mever thought I'd be happy about that.   Lastly, I miss the inFamous and Prototype games. This was my personal Golden Era of games.
cole looks like jesse pinkman
The real winners are those who, after like 13 years, can finally rest and never have to request this battle again
No way megatron could beat freiza
Wow.  Fun fight!  Wasn't sure about Cole's chances here, tbh.  Plus it's always a bonus when the character who's clearly just a straight-up dickhead loses, lmao.
I’m kinda excited for Frieza vs Megatron, a DBZ vs Transformers match up. I’ve been thinking if they can do a DBZ vs Transformers for a long time. And here we are now 😆
Hey death battle can you please make a lich vs Emperor belos death battle PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
I been wanting to see this fight for years even tho im team Mercer i enjoyed this fight but i still think Alex should of won but either way thanks for making this
This was battle was awesome sauce, Boomstick. I love Alex Mercer but Cole MacGrath was going to pull through in the end.
I think this just confirmed PlayStation better than Xbox 😳
Madra vs whitebeard
The TFS nod is genius when describing Cole's powers.

First ever time I had to root for both characters
It's uncanny that franchises like these are unbelievably amazing yet so short lived, I always wanted another infamous and prototype title.   If that were to theoretically happen, I would have the infamous sequel centered around delsin and his crew finding out more about the paper conduit while earning coles jacket as a keepsake to honor him while encountering "conduits" with bio-mechanical appendages and/or abilities that appear ever now and then as they go on about snuffing out the remnants of the D.U.P.   As for the prototype title, it should be centered around pariah making a return and cleaning up after the mess Alex and heller made during their campaigns , becoming a vigilant bio warrior amongst the death and destruction of new York, expanding to somewhere else with blackwatch and gentek creating actual literal superhumans with various, non biological powers, ranging from flight, to magic and witchcraft, to self cloning, invisibility, ect.
They can’t be serious. Frieza vs Megatron for the next one? Megatron doesn’t have a chance. Frieza would barely need to lift a finger to send Megatron to the scrapyard. How is he going to compete with a powerful alien that can destroy planets with ease?
Don't know if anyone noticed this, but they brought up Goku's muffin button :)
Crash Bandicoot vs Tazmania Devil
7:35 wow, just wow.
Does his story and powers sound like static mhmm I see what they did
The next death battle is going to be awesome
KIRITO VS VERGIL
We need Ohma Tokita(Kengan Asura) vs Baki Hanma(Baki the Grappler)
I’ve actually been waiting on this battle since both games came out. Thank you
I'm sorry but there is no way Alex would lose to Cole
So let me get this straight, you give Mr electro a defence that's low af then show prototype guy able do millions of times more damage then that and able to survive millions of times more. Also ignoring the almost infinite energy and life source he has and somehow he gets killed? This make no sense on every scale they used
I played infamos when i was younger and seeing cole again made me want to start my ps3 again just to play infamos 1 and 2
Frieza is gonna dog walk megatron
Iron man vs master chief!
While Frieza vs Megatron isn't the Transformers fight I wanted to see next I'll take it.
Now we just need a Death Battle between their successors!   James Heller vs Delsin Rowe!
Where did Cole's amp Go
I will be saddened if Shadow the Hedgehog doesn't win this by pwning both of them & taking his powers back.
Hmmmm…. I get that cole would win by brute strength… but you didn’t put Mercer’s intelligence into the battle. I believe he could’ve beaten cole by transforming into cole’s friend. And use his surroundings to eat at cole’s power
Cole had a healing factor??
Next fight is gonna be weird. Megatron is 35 feet tall and Frieza is only 5.2 feet.
I've never played the PROTOTYPE games but I've always wanted to. I've played the first two Infamous games and love them both, so this one was one in which I cheered for Cole to win and celebrated when he did.
I wanted this fight for so long, and it was worth the wait tbh
Lets take a moment to appreciate the fact that Cole Macgrath in comparison to Alex Mercer, has been fighting with many enemies that have been proven to be much stronger than himself while Alex is basically in a sandbox of corruption. It makes sense that he would take lightly to just about everyone he comes across. And another thing, there are some instances where Alex could easily oneshot cole but yk so does cole. The ionic storm probably could've devastated Alex's healing factor and could've given cole enough time to finish him off with the bio leech ability like how it ended here. Still a 10/10 matchup since I been waiting for many years for this to be gone over 🤺
Should've been delson Rowe for a better match up
Day 5 of asking for   “Rengoku vs Jetstream Sam”
if the battle ground has some npc then alex was undefited
This was awesome! Just a classic case of hero vs villian that is sorely missed nowdays.
a better battle would have been Cole vs Raiden and Alex vs the darkness
Jackie Estacado (the darkness) vs Fumikame Tokoyami (My Hero Academia)
This is like closure for me.  I grew up with these two edgy early 2000 video game protagonists.
While I preferred Alex's games, I still rooted for Cole.
Haven't gotten to the fight yet or alex's explaination, but it seems like the beast that cole beat has alex completely dwarfed in power.
Bad death battle, should've been evil cole won't watch
I’ve never been so happy to be wrong. I really wanted Cole to win but I was worried about Alex’s absorbing powers. TvT
Master chief ( halo ) vs prophet ( crysis )
I've been waiting 10 years for this match up. Was it worth it? Yeah. Should it have taken that long? Probably Not.
So, Ol' Bucket Head's gonna be the next match up    Well, I'd like to point out that Megatron is able to control anti/dark matter, cant really remember which unfortunately, that he's able to channel via his fusion cannon, allowing him to basically shoot black holes
2 beings who became blessed with great power...both became legends for different reasons.  Alex Mercer who became bittered and chose to replace humanity with his own twisted view of the next generation, becoming the Prototype monster of New York City.  Cole MacGrath who chose to help people in need and give humanity a fighting chance against evil, even at the cost of his life becoming the InFamous hero of New Marais.  They both meet in battle in Manhattan...yet only one remains standing.  Great Insanity vs Great Responsibility.  13:19 FIGHT!!      18:05 A RIVALRY FINALLY SETTLED!!
who else thought this was starkiller
Infamous 1 and 2 were my favorite games on the PS3. Now, i wanna go get a PS3 and the infamous games. Prototype was fun and i played it several times but not nearly as much as Infamous. Second Son was good but i hate that it ended there. I randomly found Infamous 1 when it first came out and I was in one of the worst times of my life and that game was my escape from the BS. I honestly don't know how many times I played thru infamous 1. My last count was 42. Infamous 2 was alright. Didn't care much for the new voice actor and I wish they came out with what happened with the evil Cole timeline. Probably be something similar to Prototype 2, where another emerges and can go toe to toe with the original.
I swear healing factors / regeneration just doesn't matter in deathbattle. no matter what it is, it just gets ignored, discarded, or negated. also wtf is this next fight dude? coughing baby vs hydrogen bomb, lmfao.
The Thunder Drop finisher is appreciated : ) it’s my favorite move in Street Fighter X Tekken
Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me - John 14:6. I felt led to share this with you all 🥰
Isn't James technically stronger than Alex?
Please please PLEASE have Little Kareebo do the voice of Frieza!
VECNA VS SLENDERMAN PLEASE LET IT BE NEXT
As much as I wanted Alex to win (cause I played Prototype before Infamous, nostalgia and all) there was like 15% chance of him actually winning. Plus after Prototype 2 I learned harsh truth: Alex sucks when he's not controlled by player. On other hand Cole is just... Cole.
Alright I loved this fight, I played and beat both these games and had a blast with both. I prefer Alex Mercers powers tbh and thought he’d win with the simple act of touching cole. But cole is super human and goes at a deeper level than Alex’s powers do. Plus narrative wise it is nice for the good anti hero to beat the ultimately evil one.  Now that this battle has been settled I got a new one. Charon from fire starter vs Sebastian Shaw from marvel
Thank god cole won sorry I’m team infamous more than prototype
I thought Alex Merced would win not because I like him more or his powers than Cole’s but because there was no evidence up until now to say who would win. I think these characters are even in their respective franchises both deserve respect
didn't expected it to be that close match.  Cole only won by interrupting Alex 's healing, being faster and resistant to Virus
Man I use to have little what ifs about these 2 in my head as a kid these games see both dope 🔥
I love the soundtrack for this fight
I thought that was starkiller
We still need Cole vs Starkiller
Now we have to see James Heller vs Delsin Rowe
Soundtrack reminded me of Venom 2 Last One Standing
I'm actually pleasantly surprised by the result. inFamous was one of my favorite games to ever do the open world formula as was Prototype.
Watch them try and convince us megaton can beat mf Frieza
I think I’m finally satisfied with the the infamous franchise thank you❤
Kenshin Himura vs Gintoki? :)))
Oh wow! For so many years, since the possibility of these two getting into a Death Battle was first brought up in the comment section, I thought Alex was a shoe in to win this fight. Looks like Cole has more juice than I thought. Here is where I would bring up my “should’ve been James Heller” but, after seeing what Cole is actually capable of, I’m not sure Heller would have done too much better. And, of course, the fight rocked. Guessing streak stays at 0.  *Next Time on Death Battle*  And not a Mewtwo in sight! Yes, Lawd!
Jessica Rabbit vs Holli Would
Frieza vs Megatron? Frieza's displayed his destructive capabilities many times, so we know he can destroy a planet no problem. But what does Megtron bring that could even give the Decepticon leader a chance? It feels like a bad match up.
If this is comic megatron then my boi frezia is cooked
Finally
That was pretty cool I really want an infamous game on pc or at least a remastered version of the old ones
Blue beetle v.s. iron spider
I legitimately didn't expect that.  Especially Prototype 2 level Alex seemed more like a near unstoppable force of nature.
Idk why since its such a minor thing, but Wiz saying "Lets end this debate once and for all" instead of "We've run the data through all possibilities" made me feel really nostalgic
Can we have General Grievous fight or how about a Zoolander fight in a future Death Battle?
That was pretty awesome
Cole barely won  too sum up.
I fell like Alex never actually died when absorbed he was the virus’s so how could he be aspired by it?
Oh man the next one is gonna be so weird and hype
As someone who didn't know anything about these two, it really sounded like Alex was going to win, but the explanation at the end made sense. And they chose good Cole to effectively lowball him. That was effectively indicating just how inferior Alex is. Dayum son, talk about the burn~
This battle is 9/10 even cole win i till love both character they are my childhood game man it make me cry when watch this remember myself at a kid👏👏👏
Do Luigi vs tails
14 year old me would’ve been so hyped for this
Finally it's finally here
one can say its Shadow the Hedgehog vs Shadow the Hedgehog
These were two of my favorite PS3-era franchises and I'm so happy to see them again regardless of the context.
You've gotta be kidding. Frieza would win in his very first form even in the Namek Saga, easily. Now that Black Frieza has been introduced this is possibly the most lopsided fight ever. I bet Death Battle will not count anything past Z or maybe the DBS, just watch them nerf Frieza.
I knew cole would win😅
I have been an inFamous fan for ages, but even I believed Cole would lose. I have never been so happy to be wrong in my life 🤩  Alex may have been downright bad, but Cole is infamous!
🤩 THAT WAS STRAIGHT AWESOME SAUCE 🤩👍
The real losers in this were those helicopters.
I've been waiting for this fight for YEARS! The hero this city needs vs the one it deserves
John wick vs John Preston from equilibrium.
Great power comes great responsibility. The most powerful is the one who knows how to control powers. Who can Cole face next, Laxus(Fairy Tail)? Ness(Earthbound)? Anyone else electrical? Who can Alex face next, Venom, Carnage(Spider-Man)? Spawn? Was there a vote to put "Infamous" and "Prototype" into battle?
I was waiting for a twist where, despite killing Alex, Cole gets infected. Or Cole sacrifices himself to kill Alex. DB has had a thing for twists in their fights like Bill VS Discord and Tanjiro VS Jonathan
Eu adorei muito bom
Does anyone remember The Darkness.....anyone?
I would have liked to see The beast Alex in this fight
I wanted Cole to win but I didn't think he would win lol. .I kinda thought Cole lost easy. I thought Cole had normal human durability. Not including video game logic
Clearly the easiest way to get rid of Alex Mercer is to be bald while you fight him, its way more consistent than you think!
Bro I’m so sorry but the rap does not go with the fight
Brutal
Hi
Let's try Master Chief 117 vs. Star Fox
Greetings from Russia =)  I understand everything, you have calculated, taken into account and the like. Well done. Seriously.  Either I missed it or what, but isn't Alex Mercer just an image of the Black Light that the virus uses for his, shall we say, Alter Ego??? Is it correct to consider ONLY Alex Mercer, and not the entire Black Light that he is. After all, at the beginning of the first game, Alex Mercer as a person is dead and this is just an image of the virus that he uses, but the virus works for him in everything. P.S. He also still has a call for various beasts that could help him, henchmen, and so on. Have you taken this into account? Or did I miss this moment?  Sorry if it's poorly written, I used a translator.
I don't see how Megatron could EVER beat someone like Frieza. I mean Frieza could easily just blow up the planet Megatron is on, effortlessly, and he can survive in space without oxygen. Idk how a Transformer is going to survive a planet busting explosion. And even if the fight takes place in space, how the heck is Megatron going to win?
We haven't heard from Sucker Punch in a long while after Ghost of Tsushima. I wonder if they'll do an Infamous remake or Sly Cooper 4
i've been requesting for this match up for over a decade.  was not disappointed ♡
Day 1 of waiting for little mac vs ippo
The next death battle that would be so epic yet probably won't happen unless we vote on it is Geralt of Rivia Vs Tallion from Shadow of Mordor and War. I think if that episode had as much effort put into as this one it would be an excellent fight. I honestly don't know who would win from playing both their games but I would love to see what Death battle would say if they had to analyze both of these characters.  I think Tallion would win based on his massive advantage in speed and agility as well as his wraith abilities that has the possibility to to overwhelm Geralt but he is much more experienced, has means to deal with wraiths, and has good magic abilities that could counter Tallion's BS.  This would be such a good 3D sword fight with both characters having such a wide array of abilities and skills that I would just be happy if they made this an episode and make the fight at least 5 minutes long like Dante v Bayonetta.
Freeza will only need one finger to destroy him. no need to even transform lol
Another spooky Halloween special for death battle art the clown from Terrifier and ghostface from scream! Art vs ghostface!
The only thing this fight needed was to have "Fight!" before the battle started to truly give us thay vintage 2013 Death Battle experience.
brought a tear to my eye to see not just cole get depicted well but get the W. infamous is such an awesome franchise and to see cole back in action made my day.
Chopper  VS R2-D2!
DEATH BATTLE YALL THE GOAT FOR THIS
Use. Your. Good. Match. Ups. The dry fan service ones, sure get your money. But every other match up should be a good one.
I love how much head canon they used to give cole the win
And much like with the escapists' lingerie battle, Cole comes out on top
I like how both analyses start with the same quote and lead down different paths. It's a neat little touch. Still, I'd want to see a reboot of Prototype. the game seems hella fun. All that aside, I questioned at first why this was so popular. but now I see why. guess we'll have to see how the next champion's pick plays out.
An element can kill the enemy: Electrics can Super effective against Virus type in short Ouo b
Amazing.
Hell, it's about time.
This was a "shockingly" good fight. I mean the fight was on the cutting edge.😂
But seriously why aren't there more prototype games? That was one of the best sandbox games ever.
I don't think the next match up is fair, they will have to prove me wrong.
👏👏👏
We miss you Cole!!!!
This fight is the most electrifying things I’ve seen. It took them a long time to do this, but it’s worth the wait. I’m glad I get to watch this fight.
Frieza is going to dogwalk Megatron
Alr now do HitMan vs Dishonored !
Years later we get this fight. Awesome sauce.. 😉🤣 now do:   Doom Slayer vs. Dante (Devil May Cry)  Mega Man vs. Sonic  Sam Fisher vs. Agent 47  Solid Snake vs. Lara Croft (or Alber Wesker)  Master Chief vs. Kratos   Asura (Asura's Wrath) vs. One Punch Man   Chris Redfield vs. Leon Kennedy
you guys should do season champions. either through a bracketed tournament between each victor of the season, or a free for all between them. and then maybe do a tournament for the season champions to crown the king of death battle.
Db character vs transform character WHAT?!😨
I didn't care who won. This was an epic battle to see. I love these characters back when I played these games in the 2010s. They were the best.
Which version of Frieza?.I don't  think this will go well for Megatron considering Frieza is faster and can destroy planets with a finger tip ball blast
This would be a great 3D fighting game with some amazing characters.
Y'all need Cable Vs. Someone with a virus in them. Techno. Dance battle.  Pretty please.
See... now I wanna see evil Cole deal with him. I think that fight would go very differently, though same result.
Before watching imma guess Cole from Infamous
Always love when they're able to make a situation where the characters would actually fight
i am waiting for Vilgax
Listen As a long long time death battle fan the new animation and quality is unrivaled…. But this is the first vid in a while that has the secret sauce, Super creative great DEATHBATTLE
So why did they go back to "Let's end this debate once and for all"? Even the preview video names are different.
There’s no way that’s the next fight 🤣
This brought back alot of memories of me debating with friends lmao
This was a pretty good battle. Well animated. I'm not sure how megatron can beat frieza tho
I loved this fight.  This feels like a fight that makes a ton of sense.  Both characters are represented as insanely powerful and next to impossible to kill, but Alex chose to his power consume him and was killed by someone with the same power as him.  While Cole chose to use his power to protect others and made the choice to sacrifice himself to save everyone.  I'm really glad they chose to wait until they got an extremely good engine to run this animation.  God bless the fans, and God bless the crew at Rooster Teeth.
I'm not gonna look at the comments yet but Alex sounds like an infamous boss battle and the hype is crazy   Edit: after seeing it I think that's exactly what they were going for because it gave that feelings completely.😂 Megatron Frieza Hype!!!
09:32 He said the thing!
Frieza and Megatron? well knowing Death Battle's history with anime franchises....
From a game perspective, I put Infamous head and shoulders above Prototype. Both the gameplay and story for me were so much more enjoyable and memorable.  That said, I'm actually pretty surprised about the result. Cole seemed to genuinely struggle with the enemies he had faced while Mercer just seemed like an OP monster from start to finish.
man this was setting up to be a cool fight, but the cringe rap vocals ruin it. Also I don't like the contempt with which they act towards older death battles. Sure they lacked production value compared to nowadays, but at least the matchups were videogame centric and not the same marvel/dc/manga/90's cartoon repeat that more recent seasons suffer from
really need to see deathwing vs bahamut.
Starkiller (The Force Unleashed) vs Cole McGrath (inFAMOUS 2) Been requesting this for YEARS!! 😭 Lol please Death Battle!🙏
Please do Baki Hannma vs Ohma Tokita
This ended exactly how it should've
WAIT WHAT. MEGATRON IS FIGHTING FRIEZA?? I thought it would be Unicron vs Galactus!
Inspector Gadget v. Gizmoduck (Duck Tales)
Sho'nuff vs Zeus The Last Dragon vs No Holds Barred
Far too many of these battles tend to be mirror matchups. Hero vs. hero, villain vs. villain. This one was singularly, utterly SATISFYING, because it's a straight-up hero vs. villain match. We don't get nearly enough of those on this channel, but it makes it all the better when it happens. SPOILER    I was rooting for Cole the whole way. Nearly let out a "YEAH!" through the house when it happened.
Good Cole didn't 'save' humanity, he doomed it. The Beast was not the impending apocalypse. That was revealed to be a plague that would eventually go on to kill any human that wasn't turned into a Conduit. The Beast's plan was to create as many conduits as possible so that humanity could survive the epidemic. By destroying The Beast and cleansing the conduit gene, Cole ensured that there would be nobody left who could survive the infection!
Awesome sauce
Nahhhhhh
This was fucN awesome 🔥🔥🔥..... Loved playing both when I was younger but enjoyed Infamous story line the best, low key reminded me of Static Shock ⚡
Godhand when?
I think there's a problem with this interpretation.  A virus is a virus.  Unless the guy could control his own molecular structure at will, the virus won the moment it managed to injure him because he was already infected.  I guess you could argue that he could "technically" sterilize himself at the exact moment he was injured by electrocution, but that is a very big "could"
I really miss this era of gaming.  The era of full, complete, badass and fun games with no microtransactions 😢
ye old e=mc^2
The Evil Cole would blink Alex out of existence that’s why they used the Good Cole
2009 was insane with heros and villans.
Cole MacGrath vrs Static shock
13:41 Do he just spin dash?…. …like Shadow the Hedgehog….
So happy Cole won this
Man, blast from the past. Makes me wanna see more old school game match ups. Isaac Clark vs Commander Shepard? Master Chief vs Prophet? Dante vs Kratos?
YES FINALLY
YYYYYEEEEEEESSSSSSS
That was a nice deathbattle!!! But… if you really want an epic DeathBattle, must be Infamous vs Quantumbreak!!!!
Do whiz vs boomstick
How is Megatron going to come close to Frieza? Forget Golden form, second form Frieza conceivably destroys Unicron.
tbh, I wanted cole to lose simply bc having a hero win in a hero vs villain matchup is pretty cheesy :/
Freeza vs Megatron seems good. Now try these:  Alita battle angel vs major Motoko Kuzanagi Megas XLR vs Gundam Exia Generator Rex vs Blue Beetle Zeta vs Cytro Ghost Rider vs Spawn
need Prototype 3
But Cole became a vampire, idk if his resistance would work against Alex either.
Vash the stampede vs Vincent Valentine
Frieza vs Megatron is either going to be woefully one sided or I'm gonna learn some crazy ass stuff about Megatron. Either way I'm okay with it.
Awesomesauce!
So the Two Paths(Infamous) wins against Just Evil Path(Prototype), *Wheeze* I'm Glad...
Frieza vs Megatron? Are we including Black Frieza?
Incorrect ending Cole could not resist. Power scaling gone wrong again
Do Astro Boy vrs Mega Man.
I didn't think Cole would win but I am so happy he did!
Wow, maybe next you should do their successors delson rowe vs James heller
Gotta say this outcome was a pleasant surprise. I really expected Alex to win. Great fight!
Now i just need james heller vs Ken kaneki
I want to see spawn again. That would be sick
I've actually waited a long time for this match up between these 2 badasses.   I remember playing prototype on my dads computer via CD, getting that 20 - 23 FPS, Man so amazing, hehe and played Infamous 1 and 2 on the PS3. Man those are the days.
Also Princess Luna vs. Freddy Krueger
Been waiting for this.🫡
Dude enjoying the open leg view or something why didn't he  back away from her open can of tuna 😂
I still believe Alex would've adapted and consumed Cole. The dude survived a nuclear explosion at pointblank range for godsakes. Good episode otherwise though.
Well, someone doesn't know how viruses and biology works
I loved Prototype. Never got to play InFamous but I knew it. This was so cool.
Playing infamous 2 was some of the best gaming of my life.Glad cole came out on top.
FINALLY, I've been waiting to c a battle between these 2 characters forever. I just wish it could've been a 3way death to include the darkness Jackie Estacado 😊
Only complaint about the fight is that Cole didnt use much of his powers.
Ain't no way someone chose  Frieza vs Megatron 😭😭😭😭
Frieza vs Megatron is the most one sided match up in a while
Cj
That was awesome
Yo can you guy make a Halloween death battle between Freddy Krueger vs The Creeper (Nightmare on Elm Street vs Jeepers Creeper) it would be awesome for a Halloween Death Battle 🎃
This battle makes no sense alex could absorb at a extreme rate as we seen in the game and comics cole absorbs yes but it takes time for him too and also cole has never been ripped in half and absorbed electricity to heal so that makes no sense plus alex didn't use all his weapons
For the next battle, I don't see how Frieza doesn't win easily. I mean, I'm sure they'll come up with some crazy feats and scaling for Megatron, but the Dragon Ball universe is just too ridiculous when it comes to power. In his very weakest state, at the least powerful we every see him in the series, Frieza completely destroyed a planet with one finger while laughing, and since then he's become on par with characters who make the universe shake when they trade blows. What is Megatron to that?
Its good to see cole macgrath again in media after for so long
14:30 i got an ad right here that said "A slight drop In temperature can lead to joint pain"
Nah this one didnt make sense, he should have killed him with those stabs
Yeah Alex is strong but he has nothing on The Beast
Could Stewie vs Rick work ?
…this next battle is gonna too lop sided
Told you!! Infamous always stronger.
I call plot armor
I've been rooting for this match up for years. I'm very happy with this fight, especially the outcome. I've been rooting for Cole for years. Sure, Mercer's shapeshifting meant he had a wider array of weapons, but the sheer power Cole has at his disposal is just something else. Alex was a blade, but Cole is a lightning bolt. Fear the Demon of Empire City. Praise the Patron Saint of New Marais
Frieza should win against Megatron simply because he trains very hard to become powerful not by finding a weapon that can make him more powerful or a robotic Planet god giving him powers no he simply trains and learns from his mistakes.
For years I've defended Cole in this debate and I'm so happy he came out on top here.
This is one of my favorite vs matchups of all time because both these games are so painfully underrated and I really want Play Station to revive both these series.
Mercer's a badass and I've only played Prototype, but the second I heard Cole had control over the electromagnetic field, I knew it was a done deal. lol
Generator Rex needs a spot in here as well
Suggestions: Lord Voldemort vs. Darth Sidious, Luz Noceda vs. Anne Boonchoy, King Andrias vs. Emperor Belos
Megatron vs Frieza? Whats next Spawn vs Frodo??
I was completely “absorbed” by this “shocking” episode.  Seriously though, way to go Death Battle Crew. Back to back bangers. I can see why everyone wanted this fight for so long. And the wait had to be so worth it. “InHuman” has to be one of my top soundtracks of this season.  Next is Frieza  vs Megatron. That one I have mixed feelings for. I mean, Frieza is literally my favourite anime villain of all time, after Madara. I am very happy he’s finally getting a Death Battle, but against Megatron? Mmmm, I don’t know.
This was an awesome Death Battle! I am glad to see that it has returned to being the best YouTube show that I remember!
Death Battle request!  Naruto sanin threeway:  Jiraiya X Tsunade X Orochimaru  Pokemon Jhoto threeway:  Feraligatr X Typhlosion X Meganium  Itachi Vs Madara  Kratos Vs Broly
well that unexpected i thought cole wouldnt have any trick on his sleeves
Infamous going to win!
I wasn't too big of a fan of the animation on this one; If you took screenshots of it, it looks lovely, but the camera work made the action hard to follow at times and the character animations were unnaturally snappy, and lacked any real inertia.
I know Cole from Street fighter X Tekken
Frieza vs Megatron is gonna be like Hulk vs Broly
That one was great but next one looks like it will be even better. Keep up the good work!
You guys think they’ll ever revive these games?
Carnage vs alex mercer
Yesssss!!!!! I’ve been wanting Alex Mercer for the longest time  Pissed that he lost tho
Frieza vs Megatron?   Unless Megatron has been working at less than 1%. Of his power Frieza will mop the floor with him.
So by logical deduction, we should now get James Heller vs the Second Son kid. Right?
Can we get (Prototype) James Heller vs. Venom or Carnage??? That's be dope as hell!!!
I got one for yall. You could EASILY make this one a two parter. Part 1. A death angel (a quiet place) vs an arachnid (starship troopers) vs a white spike (tomorrow war) vs a xenomorph (you know what that is). Part two. A group of TEN OF EACH in a battle. I think the fight with 1 of each species would have ENTIRELY different results from a group or a whole war.
Really happy that Cole won. I like both characters, but definitely prefer Cole so his victory here was great. It was made even better by the use of good Cole since it makes him the hero in this scenario which made me root for him even more.
Spots / obito  ??
And even Infamous 2 Evil Cole isn't canonical tge strongest version of Cole. You can gain both the good and evil powers in New Game +(even inheriting some benefits from Infamous1 saves), and the Festival of Blood DLC adds vampire powers(though since it was treated as a separate game you technically can't use YOUR Cole ).
Now do new son vs James heller
Frieza is going to destroy Megatron
... wait. Something doesn't add up.  A virus doesn't need neurosignals to function. And Alex was a giant virus body. He shouldn't have been vulnerable to Cole's electrical detection OR his absorption.
Welp…..time to poor one out for my boy 🍺  I’m probably the only guy who rooted for Alex, so as you could imagine…..this hurt like hell
Holy crap! That was perfect! My favorite hero won?
I LOVED THIS BATTLE!!! Though, if I'm to be honest, I knew the outcome as soon as I heard the match-up. Still, this is probably one of the most entertaining fights I've seen.
I had no idea about either of these guys, and didn't even watch the analysis. I had no expectations past, HEY, THAT'S A COOL THUMBNAIL, why not? But this video was utterly amazing. Great job Death Battle. Especially on that sweet music.
0:36-Epic pose, dudes! 5:22 and 5:31-Well said, Wizard. 9:25-That gag never gets old. 11:40-Wizard's amazed by Boomstick's statement. 12:50-Wizard brought back the old D.B. statement. :) 13:16-Paul Guyet's back! Paul Guyet's back! That's THREE consecutive episodes he appeared in! *13:20**-{F.I.G.H.T. forms} D.B. Announcer: FIGHT!* 14:35-It's not over yet... 15:18-Cole's not finished yet! 15:55-No, Cole! 15:57-Cole's fighting back! 16:09-Way to go, Cole! 18:04-Least Wizard's amused at this. 18:05-What deserved win for Cole MacGrath, voiced by Paul Guyet! That "slipup" Discord had in the last battle now means nothing! Discord: It always meant nothing. 18:29-Don't know how Megatron can win. [inHuman] by Brandon Yates, Omega Sparx, and SWATS... EPIC music!
Knew my boy cole could pull through
The soundtrack s cuks😊
Gotta love that they left some of the 2013 writing in
Death Battle suggestions: Geralt (The Witcher) vs Belmont (Castlevenia) James Bond (007) vs John Wick (DC) Master Cheif (Halo) vs Marooned Marine (Doom) Bakugo (MHA) vs Armstrong (FMAB) Nightmare (Soulcalibur) vs Bayenetta (Bayenetta)
Muffin button! @teamfourstar!
Also, virus die by U.V. light, hot and freezing temperatures.
As long as theres any matter alex will regenerate again another flop due to not using one characters full abilities, cole loses in endurance and outright power, not to mention if alex physically touches him once he is absorbed, coles weak compared to mercer at full power.  To add on top of this the durability cole has is hardly enough to withstand mercers non transformed physical attacks, they would litteraly explode him like a watermelon, this videos biggest flaw is the fact alex stabbed cole multiple times you see after the first stab its instant absorbtion, so yeah cole loses, cant wait for yet another video debunking this series because it obviously always short sides at least one characters powers.
I love megatron but I see no way he is winning against frieze.
Now we need Delsin Rowe and James Heller to battle. A fight with the sequels
I hated the idea of cole back in the day it was a poor man’s static shock lol
Ya'll pretty bold to be making fun of the irrelevancy of the matchup in modern day when your entire series is BUILT on this kind of school playground logic.
You should do winter from wings of fire vs Hungarian horntail
Where’s luffy’s death battle
Do luz vs anne
I know it's unpopular... but if you're going to do Infamous... Delsin Rowe is WITHOUT ARGUMENT the most powerful conduit from that entire universe.  I know Cole is our guy, but OBJECTIVELY SPEAKING, Delsin just has access to WAY MORE powers.
Ummm my Cole ending was a little different ….🥴
How on earth is Megatron supposed to compete with Frieza Black. There must be some craaaaaazy comic book BS.
I love prototype but I still need to watch Infamous!
I had a feeling this was how it would end but i wasn't sure how good Alex's healing factor was
I like seeing characters which while having some stuff in common have very different powers
I have waited for this one as well as the obvious as a transformers fan. Although I think Frieza is the likely winner
Man, I still have the orange, one-strap backpack that came with the Infamous 1 delux box. lol
I posted a picture I drew on IG of a Luffy vs Spinel fight poster and that would be dope. Or a Luffy, Spinel, Mr. Fantastic, Plastic Man, Elastigirl, Rubberband Man rumble.
Good ep.  I was rooting for Mercer in the end
Megatron vs Frieza should be like Broly vs Hulk animation or Reverse Flash vs Goku Black in terms of creativity.
delsin rowe vs james heller please
Does anyone remember wanting Korra to fight Delsin Rowe, the successor to Cole McGrath in Infamous: Second Son?
Ok tf on frieza vs Megatron
Carnage vs Alex Mercer would’ve probably been a better match up
PLEASE make a deathbattle for OBELIX
Megatron vs Freeza? ARE YOU MAD!?!?! No wait, they found out something about Megatron that gives him the win. That is why it looks like a mismatch.
Bruh if they are going to composite Megatron like IDW then he would win but show G1 Megatron would get annihilated by first form Frieza.
Can you guys do Night King vs Arthas?
When he grinded the tentacles i know it was gonna be cole
I remember playing Infamous on the PS3! - They need to make a TV series
Awesomesauce!
*Spoiler warning for next death battle*      My money is on Megs. If they take into account all of his feats from the comics, shows, games, and movies, dude's pretty stacked. He's faced gods, has controlled god like abilities, has stood toe to toe with the greatest warriors in the universe such as Optimus and Grimlock, and not even death itself can keep him down for long. Frieza is no pushover but Megatron is something entirely else. Either way, this will be a spectacle to watch!!! MEGATRON IS COMMANDED BY NO ONE!!!
What A Finish!!! Nice!
This was the most fair and the most epic fight I have ever seen. Regardless of who won, this fight was goated.
I still want to see Alex Mercer fight Venom. I asked for it years ago and this is the closest I've seen.
LoL been hoping for this since I first watch the channel well done keep going guys and girls
So thats why he became the enemy in prototype 2
frieza wins
1:47 Is this clip taken from a live action commercial for PlayStation All-Stars?
Guyver vs Blue Beetle vs Tekkaman Blade please
NO WAY HE WON YES!!!!
PLEASE stop putting so much emphasis on background lyrics. I've been waiting 10 years for this match and now my Adhd makes it impossible to focus on the fight unless I mute it. I mean I can still substitute my own tunes, but still it's a shame. And I know it's not uncommon.  btw, you're straight wrong on this fight. Totally unrelated, I can only assure you. But Cole needs multiple strikes to defeat 1 mutant. Alex can cut multiple mutants in half in 1 light attack. Cole can tether or grind his way across a small town in minutes. Alex runs up, jumps over, flies above, or explodes through half of Manhattan in the same time with or without a ride. Cole can heal people under mind tar effects, but they're still hostile to Cole if you do. Alex can infect anyone at any time with a single stab. Cole regularly destroys buses covered in actual junk using only his strongest attack and has to wait for it to not be under a bridge.  Alex can destroy a military tank or helicopter in less than a second in multiple ways. Cole's ice titans a couple stories tall are a chore. Alex scales to James Heller, whom killed multiple Goliath class mutants the size of a sky scraper in a few minutes. Cole defeated an old guy with actual garbage armor, an old version of himself, a couple goopy ladies (honestly Nix should have just been Sasha, one or the other is my head cannon) and a giant bug monster thing with the help of 2 conduits, a militia, and science bombs. Alex defeated Elizabeth Green the living earthquake, and her satanic spawn with no assistance. Cole was scared of being killed by and was knocked out by a nuke from miles away.  Alex recuperated in a day from a direct hit with a nuke using only a crow, and I personally doubt he even needed it. (this is probably the greatest sentence I've ever written) Cole had to martyr himself to defeat one of the half dozen conduits to exist at the time with the help of a science goober. Alex could only be killed by his own creation out of dozens.  infamous is more fun and has a better narrative in either karma, but in an actual fight, Alex stomps... explosively... and surfs on the guts.
So happy you guys finally did a video on these guys!! Cole is still the champ!!  Always loved Cole from the inFAMOUS series. I know he’s canonically dead(?), but there’s a part of me that hopes he comes back in the series, somehow. The Infamous series was great all around, and I really hope Sucker Punch bring it back soon.
As much as I wanted Cole to win, Kessler was probably holding back during his fight with Cole. Think about it. His whole plan was to turn his past self into the savior of the world. What would he have to gain from killing Cole?
2 of my favorite games 🔥🔥
I actually thought Alex would win, but I wanted Cole to win after learning both of their stories. So I'm pleased.
This video is only 12 years too late
I haven't played infamous but the moment they said that guy can perfectly transform matter into energy it was over. Alex is impressive, cole is impossible.
Hoping Frieza is voiced by littlekuriboh for the next death battle.
I dunno why i thought the next fight would be between Unicron vs Galactus. Two giants with hunger to destroy planets
Always love when they're able to make a situation where the characters would actually fight
Well done, but to be honest, it’s unlikely that Alex would have lost... It’s somehow difficult to kill the virus with physical or energy attacks.
This fight feels like an edgy 2000s superhero flick complete with the villain goading the hero to join them.
I must admit that I am a little disappointed by this episode. These games deserve so much love, and I feel like this episode doesn't quite depict how epic they were.
While I agree with the result, I still think Prototype was the better game overall not for the story but for the things you could do. Be it brute forcing your way or doing it stealthily. Alex was the worst security nightmare ever.
I really miss this era of gaming.  The era of full, complete, badass and fun games with no microtransactions 😢
i bet for alex
It's a freaking crime that both of these franchises aren't supported anymore. They are some of the most fun and unique sandbox games ever and they were just left to die for no reason
Spoilers     If Alex did one I wonder how he would feel after seeing his memories.
Gravity and electromagnetism are separate forces.  People not well versed in science confuse the two all the time.
Now we need Delsin vs James lol (I got Delsin)
What I think is funny is this was good Cole. Evil Cole by the end of the second game was much more powerful as he had gained all the powers of the Beast and basically remained uncontested.
I'm actually surprised that this hasn't happened sooner.  Also I know it was only two seconds but does anybody know the music used in the lofi jazz bit?
finally
Remember despite anything else, these are the games whose companies both responded to Yahtzee Croshaw challenging them to put the other's main character in a woman's bra just to try and prove which is better.  They even both used rainbows and a unicorn in their submissions too!
I love the Linkin Park like song and the action kicked ass
For some reason I can't edit my last comment so I'll have to leave this here.  We both forgot another important fact. Alex can unleash his Blacklight Virus as a gas, as he did in Penn Station prior to the events of Prototype 2. The Virus can travel through anything, albeit it does need a carrier when it comes to traveling across water. And since that expulsion of the virus is what turned all of New York into another quarantined hellscape, Alex could have just used that from the very beginning and Cole would have been infected.
I’m excited for alucard and vampire hunter d to fight in a deaaaaath battle
I think that Doom Guy and Master Chief need a rematch.
Frieza vs Megatron
Idea: Nemesis vs. Lady Dimitrescu
honestly I only watched this video to see if my namesake would win lol
We need hakuman from blazblue
Freezer vs Megatron? Well FINALLY a fight a DBZ character has a chance of winning (I say not knowing too much about Megstron).  Also, pleaaaaase make it the voice of Abridged Freezer.
So anyone ever suggest Kratos (God of war) vs Ashura (Ashura's Wrath)
Been waiting for awhile for this death battle to happen.  👉👉Do Jared Leto's Joker vs Jared Leto's Morbius
Very similar
One of the best well and also sensible battles on here
Megatron vs frieza lmao 🤣🤣🤣
The soundtrack hella spoils who wins these battles, I swear.
Wow, I always thought Alex would take it over Cole. This was interesting.  Man, both franchises are pretty under rated and dope. Thanks for putting me on.
Goku’s muffin button love the tfs reference
Yall should have done evil cole
it would be cool if one of them took the other's powers
You should do marvels sandman vs crocodile from one piece
Megatron vs Frieza? Seems too one sided
If Megatron beats Frieza bro i swear to god
This was a death battle long in the making.
"The patreon saints of infamous" lol not in my playthrough
If “You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villain” was a fight…
Okay if were going for nostalgia lets have a GTA fight. Tommy from body city vs Carl from San andreas
Really goes to show how underrated both of these games and characters were. Especially Infamous, in my opinion. I feel like Second Son took all of the praise for having pretty visuals, despite how revolutionary the original game was.
What about monkey d luffy vs. plastic man?
YEAAAAH COLE MY MAN
BEST FIGHT
Nice.
I think Alex is way to smart to fight Cole head on with no plan or prep. this would be one of those situations where the villain uses pure planning to win, if I was alex there's no way I'm fighting with no info against a guy controlling electricity without having a good understanding. Alex has all the tools to beat Cole it's whether he uses them tho.. well we already seen what happens when he just fights cole head on. But that was a good battle I definitely agree cole would win in a head up fight.
Haven't watched this yet and i already do see Cole walking out of this      i was wrong
I appreciate the TFS reference
Can you leave out the music from fights plz.
I'm just a little confused how Cole's absorption worked. Would a Virus have bio-electricity to even absorb?
dub for humanity.
I think this Death Battle is ment to be the Recycling symbol on the cipher. They're openly admitting that they're using an old script from 2013
I was completely wrong and mad about it. that is all.
Damn straight, plus he kicked Akuma’s ass once
I guess now we won’t get to see Alex Mercer VS Cal Kestis for the next ten years 🙃🤷🏾‍♂️
HAHA yes i didn't think he could do it but Hell YES Cole is the GOAT !!!
This is now the boss fight I never knew I wanted.
So Megatron has zero chances against regular Frieza, not even going to compare how outmatched Megatron is to Any of Frieza's forms!
I liked the entire fight, but I think it was kind of obvious who was going to win, due to his overwhelming power.  However, one flaw, I think is that cole has repeatedly been shown to succumb to the various infection abilities for long periods of time before eventually breaking out after a power up and even in the games it’s explained  his survival of the raysphere was genetic nothing more. Also, I would have to say we’ve never seen Cole actually use his full power, except in very specific instances that the writers scripted for that purpose.  All of this is just to say that yes, evil cole wins for sure and good guy cole probably ends up dying just to land a draw with Mercer.  Assuming that he resists the infection.
Хотите я взорву ваш мозг? Игра Прототип - это сиквел фильма Нечто.
Alex's codename is Zeus, although this name is more suitable for Cole. If I were choosing a similar name for Alex, I would say he is Hades. When he takes someone's life, he copies all the skills, abilities and memories of that person, he becomes the master of other people's "souls". Cole is the god of lightning, he is Zeus, Alex is the god of the dead - Hades.
Now for the bikini contest!   (If you know you know)
This death battle reminded me of Thor vs Hulk. I played Prototype but not Infamous and thought Alex had the advantage because of his healing factor and combat experience from all the consumed soldiers and scientists. But the games never let you play as a master tactician, unless you count the stealth missions that no one liked, and was more "Alex smash puny humans" kind of game. So Cole winning with superior firepower is not to surprising.
I've never cared about this match-up. I actually played both games, but again can't care less.  Oh well, it's still Dearh Battle
Please Bring these games back to Next Gen !! 2 of the best superhero games ever made.
ABOUT DAMN TIME 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Seeing this after over 10 years of watching is indescribably satisfying
I'll be honest, i'm quite shocked at the outcome. And i'm a MUCH bigger fan of Infamous than i am Prototype. (though I did enjoy it too.)  So I expected Evil Cole to be a wash vs Alex due to absorbing the Beast's powers. ONTOP of his own. But Hero Cole I expected to lose. I'm happy about the result still xD I just didn't think he'd have the raw power to do it? But I supposed I glossed over the fact that he atomized the Beast xD it has been a quite a few years. LOL!  My next question is.... HOW WOULD VAMPIRE COLE FAIR?! XD because I loved that DLC, lol.
I am Conflicted....dragon ball vs transformers...megatron can withstand nukes and is  comparable to optimus...he might be slightly faster with more experience.... but freiza is by far stronger..and has more power..basically destroying a planet by sending energy into it..  It's the super armor tank vs the destroyer...  Cybertronian armor is nothing to underestimate..
day 2 of asking for alex mercer vs generator rex
Awesome sauce!
to be honest i really wanted alex mercer to win
rimuru tempest vs anos voldigoad I would be awesome
Frieza vs Megatron?
I can't believe it took DB this long to do this fight. Worth the wait though
the music is *FIREEEEE*
I wanna see the guy from infamous fight the guy from infamous 2
“You don’t want to give me your power? Then I’ll just take it!”  “Power stealing, huh? Thanks for the tip.”
Frieze about to clap them cheeks in the next episode
damn,  this vid made me a lot younger
the muffin button?
I played these games back in 2012 and always wanted somebody to make a fight between these two. Literally my childhood dream has come true
An AWESOME future DB could be Kratos (God of War) vs Asura (Asura's Wrath). Two AMAZING characters with pure unbridled rage going head to head with good animation would be the best DB yet, IMO.
I was kind of expecting Alex to win, but I can see why Cole won, and I'm glad he did! There was a time when Infamous and Dishonored were my favorite games.
No way! I made a tiny comic book of this fight when I was a little kid. Never though I'd see a day where this fight gets animated.
About time these 2 go head to head. 2 of my all time favorites games growing and in my opinion, best fight best sequences best song and best overall good show good f***ing show, god i those death battle for this hope so see them keep going like this they just keep getting better and better, absolutely love this channel 🫰😍🥹👌🙌. Ps i had tears finally seeing these 2 duke it out.
Please do kakashi Hatake from naruto vs Chrollo Lucifer from hxh
Wait wait oh no. My dude 2:14 no sir we not fixing to brush past goku's muffin button.
Sora vs kratos
Remove vocals in sequences with dialogue
Evil Cole is canon in my game play
I find your reasoning on this one underwhelming. First of all, gravity is not electromagnetic in nature.   I found your evaluation of Cole optimistic. The calculation you used for Cole's power limit was a major extrapolation with little to back it up. Let's assume that Cole can disintegrate bullets and harvest some energy from the process. That might imply being able to convert some of the mass into energy, but doesn't tell you anything about the efficiency or his upper limit on power output. You need to look at his actual power output, not assume that he perfectly converts mass into energy and is able to harvest and utilize all of it. Further, it looks like he can do this to bullets, but can he do it to people? If not, it's basically a moot point. Further, aside from the shield, you didn't mention any defensive or healing abilities. If he doesn't have any and Mercer hurts him, he basically dies. The way you talk about his ability to reroute electricity implies that he can move (or at least use his powers) at 90% of the speed of light, but that's not born out by the rest of the context I've seen for the character. It makes more sense that he sensed a current and was able to redirect it with human reaction speed, and the game just showed it in a fanciful way. Now, to be fair, I know less about Infamous than Prototype, so it's possible that I'm missing something, but you didn't present a compelling case for Cole's powers being even remotely close to the scale that you claimed that they were.  Looking at Mercer, it's a pretty small extrapolation to say that he must have an enormous amount of mass. He can consume hundreds of people and remain the same size, plus he can grow giant spikes and tentacles. If we apply conservation of mass, he could easily weight many metric tons. That implies that even if Cole is able to convert mass into energy, it's not at a fast enough rate to protect him from Mercer. Claiming that Cole can use this capability to kill Mercer quickly is a dubious claim. Mercer can be shot by tanks and assault helicopters, and it doesn't even phase him. He'll take a little damage, eat someone, and walk it off. He can run down a street filled with cars and knock the cars out of his way like a battering ram through Styrofoam. He shouldn't be particularly inconvenienced by Cole's ice powers.   Just based on comparing the gameplay of the games, I'm skeptical that Cole could survive getting attacked by Mercer, and I have trouble seeing how Cole could seriously hurt Mercer unless Mercer stood there passively for 5 minutes, and that's assuming that you're right that Cole can disintegrate him given enough time. You've tentatively sold me on the Ray Sphere being able to kill Mercer, not on Cole being able to do it.
Still hoping for Teal'c vs Worf one day.
frieza vs megatron? WTF kind of matchup is that?
Qrow Brawnwin (RWBY) VS Joe the Condor (Gatchaman)
They missed the chance to make Cole into a knockoff Magneto.
who chose the music for this 💀
In middle school I wanted to play both of these games but I could only get one so I chose Infamous and I never regretted it, It's still one of my favorite game franchises
Lightning for the win!
I want an actual Atom Eve versus Gwen Tenyson death battle fully animated
i just shoot the sun with my .50
My idea for a death battle... Sonic the Hedgehog vs Adam Smasher(Cyberpunk).
Well done
Yep perfect I knew Cole would win. He is just a better bio weapon.
I'm putting my money on Alex
I'm so excited for Frieza vs. Megatron!
I JUST GOT ON LUNCH perfect timing 😌
I understand that Cole has more power and impressive feats, but I still think he'd be at a significant disadvantage. It'd be a boss battle for him, one wrong move and he could die. Pretty much every move Alex has is lethal, he fights aggressively and with a variety. I know Cole has his own tools to mitigate that risk, but the fact remains his margin for error would be much smaller than Cole's, and Alex has a surprising enough moveset to catch him off guard and finish it. Having fewer ways to be killed has been the deciding factor on DB before.
Ah Prototype and INfamous… Two all but forgotten SSS tier games that everyone says is Niche and Forgets about but everyone still knows them. What an enigma.
Awesome Death Battle overall. And though it's nice to see the next two competitors finally make their debut, Frieza would totally destroy Megatron, hands down.
You could argue virus alex WANTED to be consumed by black alex... but we wont really lnow cause prototype 3 doesnt exist
Freiza vs Megatron? So either we've got a power stomp that makes Spongebob vs Aquaman (Super Friends) look tame, or they've dug up more BS than the Silver vs Trunks episode.
Ratchet & Clank vs Jak & Daxter would be awesome.
Frieza Vs Megatron Is Gonna Be Sick!
Honestly I feel like Alex Mercer would do better fighting someone from the Parasyte Universe. Like Gotou! Similar powers, similar purpose, similar L’s
I am geeking out over this video already. But the Cole takedown ripped right out of INfamous 2 at 14:12 sent me over the edge!
Wow this brings me back 🤯 I was obsessed with prototype for like 6 months when it came out
Both of those games were amazing back in the day
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSS
This was an epic fight from two of the most interesting characters from video games. This is a top 10 episode for sure.
Requested this one way back in season 2. Hyped! Don’t care who wins, just want to see it!
2:13 MUFFIN BUTTON
Mmmmmmuffin button
Ellie (The Last of Us) vs Clementine (Telltale The Walking Dead)
I'm already excited about the next death battle. It's going to be crazy!
This fight was a battle I will say that
What I love about this fight in particular is the dynamic between the two. Alex is very clearly the antagonistic, powerful force of the fight and I love Cole having to use his entire arsenal to overcome the monstrous Blacklight virus.  Makes this one stand out amongst a lot of other fights.  I was actually worried on having fights voted on by fans, as I thought there wouldn’t be enough production time to make them work. But I am truly amazed, this and Bill vs Discord were incredible!  Oh and, [InHuman] is a fantastic track. It’s been stuck in my head since the first time I listened to it, and it goes so well with the action on screen.  Well done, everyone!
A decade wait was worth it…
so glad this was finally done, these series need more love, if anyone is interested in more prototype stuff, check out the vids done by purposeless rabbit holes and by whitelight on what they would want from a new prototype game, theyre really good
I miss both of these games
Um... protype guy perceiving years of information when when absorbs people in no way means he perceives anything else that's fast. It's just because he's absorbing them
rip Megatron
What if u can do a Peacemaker vs U.S.Agent?
Cole couldn't heal enough to get to the win. Though maybe evil Cole would have won.  He'd definitely pack enough power to keep Alex from impaling a lung since electricity won't save Cole from a gut stab. Plus evil Cole absorbs people too freely to not kill Alex that way quicker.
Frieza vs megatron bruh wtf are yall on???
Abigail enough onto prototype verse
Cole: Buddy, you are one sick freak. Alex: I prefer the term "evolved."
The banter between them makes for a great crossover.
Hello fresh still exists?
THAT FIGHT WAS SO SICK!!!!!
now i feel like i need prototype 2 vs infamous second son
Ok this was nice but who wants to see Percy jackson fight I think it would be cool to him go Against Linh song From keeper of the lost cities
Yes go Cole Macgrath awesome I'm so glad Cole won
Well it took 10 years, but I finally just won a old school yard argument
Come on Sony give this franchise a chance once again ⚡🌪
Never expected this lol.
Honestly kinda glad this one was delayed so long, the animation was top tier. Fantastic as always. Big thanks to all the folks at screw attack!
Death battle without logic  1:mercer has power with one punch kill Cole 2:mercer regenerate and you say resistance fire electricity and then he kill him with electricity (no logic) 3: mercer stab with claws and shape Cole is Cole regenerate ? is Cole immortal? No  All I can say you have no idea, an you just want to win Cole just that
The better man, hero and franchise won. =p
Sinbad from Magi vs. Anos Voldigoad from Demon king High school
I love the infamous series to bits but even at endgame level, I don't think Cole can win.   Oh! I was wrong! Cool!   I miss infamous.
Sakura vs yamcha.
YEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSS!!!!! I didn't know how he could have done it but I was hoping Cole would win 🤣🤣🤣
DELSIN ROWE VS JAMES HELLER!!!!
Like how they didn't use most of Alex Mercers Abilities and instantly made him go Evil mode and ignored his absorbing Tentacles Cole plot Mercer not
Fun fact: protype was originally pitched to be a hulk game and there's a hulk game on ps2 that is made by the same people that plays very similarly
0:30 amazing how a few second long montage can make you feel absolutely ancient
I’ve wanted wanted an Alex Mercer death battle since 2017, it’s now finally here
Alex is stronger faster smarter he should of won death battle should of Played  both game
The next fight is Frieza vs Megatron i feel like Frieza wouldn't have to put any effort hes too fast and powerful for ol megatron even if he becomes Galvatron i see Frieza winning still
2 of my favorite video game characters IS FINALLY BACK! LETS GO
Cole won. Good triumphed over evil.
FFFFFFFRRRRRRIIIIIIIIEEEEEEZZZZZAAAAA
Frieza vs Megatron?!
General grievous vs arbiter would be cool
How tf is Frieza vs Megatron a fair matchup?
Zant vs Ghirahim.
Nope. hard disagree in this point.  I like both games. but.. mercer's not as limited on "Charge"
Leonardo TMNT vs Captain America
doesnt matter if the characters are old or new, deathbattle's death battles are pure awesome!!
I’ve wanted this for so long. Thank you so much death battle. Even though I like Mercer and [Prototype] better, I’m still just so happy that it happened.
Well who wants to pay make a Megatron funeral
FREEZA BETTER WIN!!! 18:30
How exactly is Megatron supposed to box with Lord Freeza? Even in his first appearance base from Lord Freeza casually deleted a planet with 10x Earth's gravity, and that was at 1/240th his power. In DBS he got boosted up to SSJG levels in his normal final form (Able to box with Kakarot post BoG who has SSJG levels of power in his base form), then add Golden on top of that, and now add Black which roflstomps UI Kakarot and UE Vegeta with contemptuous ease. How is this a fight?
Spoilers...    Megatron to fight PLANET DESTROYING UNIVERSE THREATENING BEYOND SSG FIGHTING FRIZA...WTF ??????.
Wow, so Cole won? Honestly didn't expect it. So many online fans would declare in the past that Alex would win easily because of his regen and parasitic powers allowing him to outlast and devour Cole. Love that they were wrong, cause Cole is an old favorite. Gotta love the original Infamous hero.
This was unexpected
Both of these could use updated reboots. Loved them both
Im so glad i waited for this. Ive wanted this and a Archer Emiya vs Noctis death battle for the longest.
Cole is HIM
Perhaps this will re spark the passion of these games and they can finally continue after all these years…. HAHAHAHA. Heh. Ha. Haha aaaahhhhhh ohhh noooo WHYYYYY!
The beast mixed with kohl's powers is like a sloppy reversion of doctor manhattan
James Heller IS WAY better than Alex mercer
I honestly hope that someday they put jimmy neutron vs Dexter from Dexter's laboratory.
Alex and Prototype was my pick back when these games came out, but hey, you can't argue the fact Alex lost to an inferior opponent and Cole beat a superior version of himself.
The next fight is ridiculous. Y’all rather see Lord freezer vs Megatron  then, seeing Dc General Zod versus Grand Regent Thragg from invincible.
I've been an infamous fan since it came out, but now I wanna check out Prototype!
Even if it's evil or not, he still Gained the abilities of all of kessler's powers, including the one way time travel trip
Should have been Cole VS Heller.
Dude what the he'll happened to superhero sandbox games like the only one I can think of right now is spiderman
Please do Rabbids vs Minions, i don't have discord
EMPIRE CITY FOR LIFE RAAAAAHHHHH
Muffin button
That's not how that works Cole couldn't off absorbed Alexs Energy since he's a living Virus The Energy would be two varied and too unstable for Cole to properly Absorb.  Now if Cole killed Alex with a Giant Thunderstorm ya sure fine but this way is just bad.  Plus even then Cole would need to charge it up leaving him self open to Mercer's attacks.  Any way apart from the end EXCELLENT MATCH UP.
I really wanna see them continue the Naruto vs star wars theme.  Obi-wan vs Kakashi Darth Vader vs Obito Let's see Yoda vs Jiraiya I also wanna see Bender vs Hk-47
When are we getting a Max Payne vs...?
I'm...shocked Cole won. But, glad he did. I hate Alex. Why o didn't finish EITHER game.  EDIT: I... wasn't trying to be punny, y'all. Just realized....
ive got the bell clicked and i still dont get notified when new DBs come out
Great animation... very wrong outcome.... Alex cuts his head off and eats him....3 seconds...
Sooooooo… Frieza wins, right? Cool.
The voice could have used a bit more gruffness but otherwise this went perfectly
MUFFIN BUTTON
For this one idc who won, but I like the results
Im very sus on cole being resistant to the blacklight virus and being consumed, and how they said cole being faster than alex…..nah well seen how fast mercer can hoof and and just traverse manhattan with ease while nah fight was fire but that outcome naaaah
how about Infamous Triple Threat???
I immediately knew cole would win as soon as they mentioned him being able to absorbing anything and turn it into energy. PLUS he got two games where as alex only had one. Its an immediate win.
Im dissapointed
Just saw the match-up for next time.  LOLWUT?
I admit the fight was pretty epic and I was also neutral in this sense; I wasn't don't have full knowledge of both sides, So having the Static Shock/Shoto wannabe fight against Resident Umbrella's Super Soldier was pretty interesting. I'm actually shocked that they were for the next showdown that they're actually gonna do it: The duel between the two Legendary Tyrants ( Hopefully the composite versions of Both)
Yo……let me be very clear…I’m a long time fan….have been stressed out and busy…had no idea this was dropping…didn’t recognize the two characters AT FIRST…then realized who they were…..paused the video to make this comment and yeah…..yeah…………video back on play. Thank you death battle cast! Your made me not realize life is filled with narcissist and gaslighters for……….a good battle. Thank you. As a human man. Thank you.
I have a Death Battle idea!  Percival (Granblue Fantasy) vs Roy (Fire Emblem)
Alex and Cole are literally the definition of "Either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become a villain"
Honestly prefer kratos vs asura or steve vs emmet
Infamous all the way fam 💯💯💯
Okay I did try to call that's it at Alex Mercer will win during the infamous short scene talk but I guess I was wrong cole did have what it take to win because I know he fought against bio monster but he never faced anyone with regeneration ability but seeing Cole actually defeated someone with that ability makes me wonder kancolle take gone Raiden from mortal kombat so another words what I'm trying to say which electric person will win if Cole comes back to death battle.
The image of Cybertron for the preview flashed and I immediately though, "yes!  They're putting my boi Grimlock in!"  And then, I was kinda bummed it was just plain ol' G1 Megs.  Oh well.
Jesus this really was written in 2013
Pre-fight for the next battle:  Megatron is a far older character, in both sources to draw from and in character age, I suspect he has survived far more than Frieza.
Yeah...why did they stop making these games??
Always loved infamous more than prototype, expected Cole to lose, was pleasantly surprised:)
Wow! Frieza vs Megatron?!?! I wasn't expecting that one. I can't wait!!!!
Cole whatever wins.   Next time, freeza vs megatron wut?
This was cool, but i feel they fudge on the details to get their choice to win
Frieza vs. Megatron is next? No offense to Megatron, but he would be absolutely wrecked by Frieza. Even Namek Saga Frieza has the ability to blow up a planet, never even mind DBS level Frieza. The power scaling of Dragonball is just so much more extreme than Transformers. This shouldn't even be much of a fight. KId Goku in OG Dragonball could destroy robots.
damn Simon from gurenn lagann looking different.
Ever considered Trevor Belmont vs. Guts,
Well I know someone is gonna be upset with the next match 😬
I’d wanna see a fight between Mr fantastic and plastic man tbh
Whiz VS Boomstick. Give both X number of characters to pick powers from but only those that they have covered. Give them a limited number of powers and put them in the ring.
men, Ive been waiting this match for a long time but it worth completly the await, maybe wasnt the expected result for me but its awsome and may god bless the cole goodness
Pre-fight prediction:  I was going to give this to Alex because of his regeneration, but then they reminded me that the Beast’s regeneration was molecular, giving Cole a way to overcome that.  I’m giving this one to Cole.
Megatron vs Frieza is CRAZY
Ah yeah. This brings back memories of all the good times I had playing Infamous 1/2/Festival of Blood.  Maybe I should fire up that ps3 again.
15:25 Show of hands, who basically just got off their ass and started cheering for Cole to win right here? ✋
Damn I knew Alex was gonna lose but was kind of rooting for him lol
Wow, you clearly don't know how to science correctly despite how much science you try and back your theories with.   Cellular regeneration on Alex's level makes him impossible to destroy, because according to scientific theory "Matter can neither be created, nor completely destroyed, merely transferred to another form". This is the very reason why being consumed at the end of Prototype 2 was the only true way to ensure he was gone for good.  Not only does Cole lack the capability to generate enough power to completely eliminate all of Alex's cells (I refer you to Perfect Cell who has the same regenerative ability, and Gohan had to pack enough power into a Kamehameha for it to EXTEND MILES INTO SPACE to do him in, a power scale Cole is nowhere close to), that last attack basically ensured his failure. Do you know what an explosion does to organic tissue? It scatters it, across a very wide area. It doesn't matter how much of Alex's regeneration Cole tried to 'sap' with that move beforehand, that explosive finish just pushed Alex's biological material all over the place.   All Cole did was prolong the inevitable, ensuring that not only will Alex come back - after absorbing a crow, a dog, a person, hell, even a *fly* would be enough to start (because he is not just Perfect Cell, he is Perfect Cell fused with John Carpenter's 'The Thing') . . . but there will probably be *multiple* Alex Mercers created once the disparate parts of his cellular anatomy absorbs enough biomass to regenerate as individual copies.   This is almost exactly like how you guys flubbed the Guts v. Nightmare battle by ignoring a huge part of Soul Calibur canon: It didn't matter if Guts was strong enough to kill Nightmare's physical body, because he didn't use Soul Calibur, the only weapon that can actually destroy the essence of Soul Edge which is the very reason Nightmare exists at all, and even then, only if enough force is used to completely destroy both weapons, because as long as one exists, the other will return.  Cole loses. End of story.
Music ruined the battle
Finally a real good match up
I love InFamous and honestly didn't think Cole would win this. Loved it!
Alex: Your power is mine Cole: I don't think so *pulls out uno reverse card*
golden freeza gunna reck shop next time, no way i can buy someone like megatron would be able to beat someone that literally resisted and redirected pure destruction energy, but even back before he ever trained, could casually destroy whole planets
As tough as Megatron might be, you know anything DBZ is going to be extremely overpowered.  Thinking Frieza for next battle.
This next match up should be an interesting one.
I remember arguing with my buddies back in the day. I fought tooth and nail in favor of Cole while they all argued for Alex. I hope they all see this and just picture me laughing in the background as they fume from the ears 😂
And so the great debate from a decade ago is finally settled..
They talk about alex´s weakness but what about cole´s to water,in the game if he falls in to water he basically loses his powers and even black out
Idk much about transformers, but I wish frieza would break dragon balls losing streak
Freeza vs Megatron...?
This is super late, and im just glad it's here.
This brought back so many memories, I love Infamous and Prototype.
I'll give you a few free one's for death battle.  Sakura from Naruto vs Yang from RWBY.  Link vs The hero from dragon quest 11  Yoh from shaman King vs Maka from soul eater.  Riku from kingdom Hearts vs Nero from devil may cry.  And Meliodas from the seven deadly sins vs Asta from black clover.  And killer croc vs the lizard
Took 10 years huh? Damn, it feels like even more have passed.  Good thing it's finally done.
Frieza Vs Megatron?! 😂
Cole also became a vampire once which allowed him to turn into a colony of bats and achieve flight which I find very cool.
13:53 WHA—👊
That song was terrible it ruined the fight
Got to give it to freeza, even though I’m a huge G1 fan, Freeza is just more powerful
I remember 9 to 10 years ago I had a misunderstanding with one of my friends where I though prototype was infamous and we were basically having two different conversations, Ironic this is now a death battle, haven't watch yet but Prototype definitely wins.
Nice battle 👌, I also would love to see Ryu Hayabusa vs Shinobi of Sega in the future if possible, but either way thanks to death battle for all you do
Odd that Alex and Discord were finished off in the same ways
Kratos Vs Sun Wu Kong would be awesome
That muffin button reference definitely tells me this script was from 10 years ago.  And yet, I'm laughing just as hard as I would back then.
an infamous remake would be nice
When are you going to do the most important one? Who would win between wiz and broomstick
Frieza vs Megatron huh? Alright but in terms of size I think Megatron has the upper hand here. I mean Megatron is bigger than Frieza
Intro (0:04) Cole's Rundown (0:39) Alex's Rundown (6:41) Fight (12:57) Results (16:19) Next Time (18:20)
My money is on megatron
Disappointed Shadow the Hedgehog didn't make an appearance.
so excited about frieza vs megatron
*FREIZA VS. MEGATRON!?!?*  Who would've guessed that!?
Evil karma 😂
Bro I love prototype
So on patreon which level do i need to buy to sugest a match up?
Ain even gone speak on it cause ion know much about Transformers but FRIEZA A BEING A PLANET BUSTER prolly not even unicronstand a chance but don’t kno much about TF
Cool I’m on team megatron wonder what other transformers are going to show up. We’ve already had starscream, Optimus and now megatron maybe a combiner or Unicron or maybe one from the beast wars.
So I guess vampire cole DLC isn't a factor
"Cole can also control kinetic, thermal, and gravitational energy. After all, electromagnetism is very broad." Excuse me? Thermal and kinetic he could at least hack, (but not control directly) but gravity? I'm sorry is that even canon?
Dragon ball and transformers have NO REASON to be a match up. You kidding me ? A galactic tyrant vs a super bot ? Yeah OKEY
Cool fight can you do sonic vs mario part 3
You should consider Asterix VS Popeye. Magic potion vs spinach.
I can’t believe it took them this long to get this one. I feel like this should have been one of the first death battles
Calling it for next time, Frieza wins. At least by going off of OG Megatron anyway. Frieza is a planet buster, and Megaton simply can't compete, even when he was upgraded to Galvatron. Megatron likely has more experience, but Frieza has him trumped in pretty much every other way, and that was during the Namek saga. If they bring in Gold or Black Frieza, well... it was nice knowing you Megatron. And for the record, I'm an OG Transformers fan before I'm a Dangon Ball fan.
no
Wow a white guy with electric powers that's rare when lightning lad was turned black in recent DC comics and movie
Finally! For once the winner is from a show/game/franchise that I've actually player/watched myself! There's been a trend for the last few battles where I would only know one character out of the two, or just know more about, and they would always lose. So this is refreshing. I love Cole as a character and I love the inFamous games. Heck yeah!
New infamous and new prototype game would be beautiful
Got to watch this with the rest of my inFAMOUS discord and freak out; the animation was AMAZING! Thanks for giving us content after ten years of a franchise dry spell! Now I can survive another ten years
Didn't prototype set the ground work for WARFRAME or am I thinking of a different game
I'm not sure about Cole's resistance to the blacklight virus, but I am convinced he has the power to put Mercer down.  Amazing Death Battle. I've played both, and this felt very authentic to their fighting styles
This fight feels like a reality type fight like invincible vs Omni man
Dr. Draken vs Dr. Doofenshmirtz
Prototype still a better game
Frieza vs Megatron?  You’re aware Frieza can destroy planets with his finger, right?
I thought Alex Mercer was going win
YEAAAHH COLE MACGRATH LETS GO!!!!!!
OH HO HO HO HO! NEXT TIME WE GET HAMMY!!!! Organinc vs Mechanical Ki VS Energon Dragon Ball VS Transformers  FREIZA!! VS MEGATRON!! Yes.
Gambit vs Nightwing, Exodus vs Martian Manhunter, US Agent vs Talon, Samara(Mass Effect) vs Atriox(Halo)
If they ever end the show the final episode should be Wiz vs Boomstick
I want to see Delsin vs Cole
I love that good karma Cole bio leeched a monster. Weird none of the boss fights ended like that with evil Cole but it it was evil Cole he’d literally Ionic Drain him
Please do a sequel to this fight!! ❤❤  Infamous: second son vs prototype 2
Freeza vs Megatron. Is. Not. Going. To. Be. Close. The WEAKEST freeza was is still blowing up planets. Megatron can’t even take out city level. So. What am I missing because this is like Hulk vs a cat. 😂
I KNEW IT!!! Lightning Boy for the win! Also, Death Battle idea: Luz Noceda vs Ren Amamiya/Joker.  Battle Theme: Soulbound by Therewolf Media ft. Divide Music(Joker) and CamiCat(Luz)
Please, someone suggest M.O.D.O.K. VS Brainiac.
I want another prototype  game 😢😢😢
I love the use of semantics in this show, because what this boiled don to was "molecular vs atomic". We often use these terms synonymously in everyday conversation, but they are truly vastly different concepts. Love this show man!!
No, merser must win!! Wtf??!!
The next battle isnt even a battle the results are so obvious its like Mike Tyson vs a 4 year old toddler who is missing 1 arm and 1 leg.
I freaking LOVE this video so much!!!
THIS WAS AWESOME 😭😭 I nearly cried when myboi Cole won
Was not expecting that ending AT ALL
I loved both games. Thank you for making this death battle a reality.
I figured the one whos power is energy related could defeat someone whos power is flesh related.
Why is it always my favorite Loses....
Alex stabbed him a couple of times does that mean that cole has black light now. I think they glossed over the fact that he's a virus.
Kinda mad they mentioned the ice powers for Cole but not really the fire powers. Also why did they keep comparing Cole to Shadow when Static (shock) would have been a better comparison.
STill waiting for Dexter Vs Jimmy Neutron.
Husbando won! YES!!
Awesome death battle. They really need to remaster infamous 1&2
This fight would've gone a lot differently if Alex just flicked Cole into the ocean he electrocuted himself to death.
Frieza vs Megatron sounds like a huge miss match
Just seeing these two guys make me feel old already.
Rock Lee vs asta ESCANOR VS MADARA, ITATCHI , OR GUY Naruto vs gojo  Mega man vs samus  Like cmon bro I feel like y’all gettin lazy with some of these like frieza one shots megatron that fight ain’t even close and everyone knows it, please try puttin a little more effort into these match ups, didn’t even bother watching the death battle episode before this one lmao
interesting..
Geralt of Rivia vs. Remus Lupin Luffy vs. Mr. Fantastic (power vs intellect)  Please do one of them
Frieza vs Megatron, that's unexpected but what the heck I'm for it
Do Yusuke Urameshi NEXT!! lol
Jack of blades vs majora
Better game, better character, better story and a win lol
My favorite part was when Cole said "You may be the Prototype, but I am infamous"
Frieza vs megatron?? That’s a WILD idea, flesh vs metal.
God I want an infamous reboot
What is this live action clip at 1:45 ? Was a movie made and I missed it?
I played and still owned both Infamous and Prototype games. I knew Cole could win but thought Alex would win because he's hard to die in game while Cole is ease to dies in game. I knew DB would make them evenly match with the math calculations. I no longer think that DB will have a one sided fights so I'm not surprised with the results. Infamous is my favorite PS3 game of all times and DB did these two franchise justice. The rivery for both games was big so this fight was a treat to watch.
I love how this fight turned into a classic Good VS Evil fight between a hero and a villain. Sorry, I just love cheesey tropes like that 😅
That shot at 15:49 kicks ass.
such a good matchup
Hands down one of the best fights from this channel period
We are SO close to Unicron vs Galactus.  also...Is Black Frieza going to weigh in? Because Golden Frieza DEFINITELY is... (I can't wait to hear LittleKuriboh inevitably voice Frieza)  And Galvatron should as well....  Megatron has MUCH more experience than Frieza, but Frieza is SO OP...  I predict...that in the end...Only a Chilling Elegy will remain of Galvatron.
Damn Alex Mercer and Muzan from Demon Slayer fight the same way
FRIEZA VS MEGATRONFND
it has been years... i have been asking for this since 2010... thank you
The next one is random af.
Damn that was bad ass
LETS GO COLE MY UNDERDOG BOY FINALLY SETTLED THE DEBATE
EPIC battle idk why the script was tossed
Freiza and Megatron? There must be some comic bs that Megatron has otherwise even Namek Frieza could stomp him flat in one blow
Megatron gonna get mauled
I was able to see this one going both ways. Really well made. Animations were kinda clunky though. Good way to show the fight though, just smooth it out some and animator will be really good
This is legit the first battle I've ever cheered for when the winner takes the W.  Good Cole ftw.
This was such an awesome fight to watch!
i could barely stand that script, i feel cheated a proper analysis, but that fight was amazing as always and im very glad my boy cole won,
🔥🔥🔥🔥
i always knew Cole would win
I remember reading an old fanfiction of Cole and Alex being transported into the anime Claymore and it was good in my opinion.   The two actually had good chemistry in the story sharing a brotherhood relationship with Cole teaching Alex what it means to help people and do good things, and Alex teaching Cole that you gotta get your hands dirty in order to protect innocent people.
This felt like the Infamous DLC that never got made and I’m all for it
To be honest, as great as this is, I was expecting Alex Mercer (Or James Heller since he is technically stronger than Mercer now) to fight Ken Kaneki, it just seems more like it, to me anyway.
Vocalist for the battle music sounds like “Weird Al” Yankovich.
If megatron fights frieza then we would get unicron vs galactus in the future
15:54 Consuming your life, huh?  Thanks for the tip.
Bro Alex won he stabbed him but the just talked if he didn't talk he would of just consumed him
Man I suggested this year's ago...good tonsee it happen.....Now a team one Gears if War vs Halo
Frieza vs Megatron, i think frieza should win because of all his feats. We shall see in the nex death battle.
Death Battle is the best part about Mondays. This was just so fun to finally see after YEARS of people talking about it. It's cool Cole won with the bioleech ability given how that's a power on his evil side. Goes to show how versatile he is despite everything Alex could do. I miss both these games... what a fun time they were, just be a complete badass powerful hero or villain in a truly unique open world.
Oh no, Boomstick is becoming self-aware.
Counterpoint: Prototype is the better game.
While both ultimately died- Cole let himself die for the greater good while Alex was put down for the greater good.
I admit I wanted cole to win but the other guy seems to be a beast. So to me it’s all on how fast the other could eat the fastest. Since they both can absorb their enemies. That’s my thought process.
I can die happy now
I like it when the heroes win
Frieza vs megatron is going to be awesome. Megatron could win
You should do one of frost from mortal kombat vs killer frost from dc
Cole should've said "thanks for the tip"
While I like Cole more, I was a little surprised they gave him the win on this one...
Goku's muffin button. This script really is from 2013 😂.
I know that he only have the powers for one game, but it would have been cool to see Cole use his vampire powers.

16:20 lmao that's why the script got trashed not because yall started Both breakdowns with the Same great power great responsibility line from Spider-Man , with different punchlines lmao...you sure???
cole macgrath wins
we need the boomstick v wiz death battle
Baki vs ohma tokita that would be epic
I didn't expect that ending! Honestly thought it would go the other way!
Poor megatron
So why did u guys forget about cole’s pryokinetic like powers from the “swamp lady” can’t remember her name
We need turtles vs Robins. Another 4v4
Whoever said awesome sauce is showing their age 😂😂😂
Cole has cooler powers and a much wider range, but Alex's traversal was ridiculously fun lol
I don't think Cole's forcefield is turnning matter into energy, that side effect of the power is supposed to reflect how conductive material moving through an electromagnetic field generates a current- and slows said matter down. Its just a graphics limitation that make projectiles disapear as if Cole was directly turning them into energy  Otherwise everything seems on point. I especially liked how the victory came down to Cole draining Alex.
Muffin button
if InFamous was on more platforms it'd would've gotten more known
You guys have been around for how long and still haven't done gandalf versus dumbledore You should be ashamed of yourself
this was, by far, my FAVORITE Death battle so far. I love both of those series, so, so much.
Oml that violin playing up the scale was crazy when cole summoned that lighting stole on them both at 15:20 this song is tight asf
On behalf of prototype gang, and as someone who knows absolutely nothing about infamous, GG Cole fans
This was in my mind for the whole week ❤
This fight boils down to "Bug vs Bug Zapper."
Is goku vs sonic not Cole vs alex
This fight should have been decided via a bra wearing contest between both characters.  ZP fans represent
I’m not saying he would have won cuz of it but I would liked to have seen Alex summon some infected to fight alongside him
Alex would have won
Need these games to return. Loved both of these franchises-even Second Son. Great fight and voice acting too!
Imagine a death battle between Chucky and slappy the dummy?
Bye Bye Kirby Symbiote guy was a hater just like Vader and so that's why he was fried
C'mon! Do a Death battle between Spice Girls vs Backstreet Boys! D:
Is it just me or does anyone else get a Eminem vibe from the music
Does this mean Cole can beat Delson from 2nd son?
There needs to be another channel where they use the exact same info to infer the other character wins.
Doofenshmirtz vs ?
NOW COLE VS. STARKILLER
i wonder what other universe me is doing with the evil ending of INfamous 2 is cannon the devs said they wanted that one to jump off from but since so many people picked the good ending they went with that one being cannon
HUYYYYY  lo que  se viene la siguiente pelea va estar GOD.  Accelerator vs Gojo plissss...
That virus would live in him...cut it out.
YOOOOOOO I love infamous so much
Oh man the BGM was so good had to watch the death battle again just to listen to it again.   Freeza vs Megatron........that should be interesting.
It really is just a battle of red vs blue, isn't it? Edit: Also, I like the ending
John Wick vs Rambo
Oh, and Feeza definitely wins against Megatron. I guess Death Battle are gonna make him lose, like all the other characters I obviously don't agree with, but this one is far too obvious.
THEY DID IT THEY ACTUALLY DID IT
Gutta wonder how powerful Alex be if he Consumed Cole  and gained what he is 😅
First thing carnage would be a more appropriate opponent for alex second thing cole shouldve lost
Good thing Steven Greg and pearl were only in empire city for a day or two
Frieza vs Megatron
Great fight between Cole and Alex but, WTF is the next battle? I can buy some of these but, what do either of those guys have in common other than being the main enemy to the protagonist? Is Goku going to fight Optimus one day?
I'm muting this channel till they stop associating with the Nazi company Hello Wrotten
A planet-destroying alien that was acknowledged as the herald of destruction by the literal god of destruction... versus the reincarnation of space judas. Megatron has some insane feats, but he's just not a planet buster.
I was Honestly expecting alex to win this one even though i'm a cole macgrath fan at the end of the fight i was shocked as a mug Just goes to show how clueless i am when it comes to science lol
The only reason I don't agree with the result is I'm tired of the hero plot armor.
I refuse this! Alex definitely would've won this with his ruthlessness and absurd healing factor.
Anakin Skywalker versus Terra from Kingdom Hearts
nuh uh the evil Cole is the cannon also better powers
OMG IT IS FINALLY HERE MY BOY IS FINALLY ON DEATHBATTLE!!!  Edit: and I could not be happier with the outcome
Alex Mercer (and his power set) is my favorite in media. Absolutely fear fight!
Think we could get a round 2 with Prototype 2 and Infamous: Second Son? Wouldn't mind seeing James and Delsin go toe-to-toe like Alex and Cole did.
12:57
4:24 9:24  dude they did two corny lines 💀
Still wanting for another infamous game 😩
Ok i loved the fact this was the weaker version of cole cuz if we gave him his full power as evil cole this battke would have ended the moment it started because cole would just go literal “beast” mode and evaporate mercer
Even if he didn't bio-leech Alex, Cole at his full power in the 1st game and the intro to 2 was able to freely manipulate the atmosphere to produce lightning storms with zero effort onto a target and siphon lightning for infinite energy, and the version in this fight was him post power-merge which is implied to have an even higher power ceiling.  He could literally just focus all of the planet's potential energy stored in the atmosphere to keep him pinned with lightning till he's either completely incinerated or reduce him to such a damaged state he could easily finish him off.  There's also the abillties they didn't show in the fight shockwave blasts that he can also choose to add a shotgun blast of ice shards, sticky electrical bombs, his basic electric projectile can be changed to function like a machine gun or a sniper rifle that with a head shot can either kill or short-circuit your brain to instantly render someone unconscious, and he can manipulate the electricity in his brain to slow his perception of time
Nukes are powerful but which is stronger a man who can control the forces of nature or man created in a lab
Delightful surprised 😮
Freiza vs Megatron? Not gonna lie, I think the casual planet Buster Frieza should be more than a match for Megatron.
Is Megatron and Frieza even a fair comparison??????
Garou (OPM) vs Akaza (Demon Slayer)
FREIZA VERSUS MEGATRON?! ANOTHER DUMP FOR DBZ FANS!  *ALL HAIL MEGATRON*
Did I hear a muffin button reference 😮
I don't get why you chose Alex and not James since James beat Alex..
Apparently I wasn't the only one who wanted this fight all these years. So this was a script from 2013. I don't know if they're joking or not, but it made me miss those simpler times.
Ya bioleech FTW
I was worried that Cole was going to lose and thought Delsin from Second Son would’ve been a more fair matchup. So glad to be wrong, I forgot that Cole could absorb him.
Naaaah y’all snapped with this one 🔥🔥🔥 I was not expecting Cole to win and I was just having a heated debate with the homies about who would win and they swore up and down Cole had no chance because Alex could regenerate. lol this is probably one of my favorite battles just because both games were my favorite 💯
Unicorn vs Galactus
jubei vs ryu hayabusa , who would win. FIGHT!
Could someone please explain to me how megatron could stand a chance against BLACK FREIZA
I remember when I fought tooth and nail for Cole and everyone once thought Alex sweeps him. I remember when the sequel games just came out and when people were upset at the choices but were even more hyped to pit them against one another. Just to see this happen like this is just too amazing. Seeing all these new elements brought in. Most of all, Prototype and Infamous are brought to the people's eyes again. Even if the analysis feels a bit spiteful at times, the battle more than makes up for it alongside that amazing OST

Frieza Vs Mewtwo
Seems a little one sided
I knew Cole would win the moment I heard "At an atomic level" being mentioned.
Great episode, though i'm JUST SAYING, if Cole couldn't stop himself from being turned into a vampire in that one DLC, I dont think he would be able to stop the Blacklight virus from taking over his system(not that that changes the outcome, no way was my boy Alex winning this fight).
A next generation(game console) “Prototype” game would be crazy!! That game was awesome!
This death battle was awesome but I see no way in hell Optimus beats Frieza especially if he gets black form. Then again im not too familiar with the extent of optimus' powers.
How is Frieza vs Megatron even a competition?
This video is great for us kids who grew up in the linkin park era.
no need to do freeza . just look up black freeza. he one hits everyone
Here's the thing I'm not going to pretend like Alex should have won this fight but they did get a lot of things wrong about Alex Alex is not some villain evil guy that I feel like every story that I see makes him out to be I see a broken Man a man who was thrown into this world with nothing but one name his sister and powers that he doesn't understand from the moment he first got up he was being analyzed by doctors then he was being shot at then and then he was being betrayed and because of everything he had experienced he deduced that humanity is not worth being here in my opinion if people were in Alex's shoes I don't think much of them would be any different that's why I don't hate Alex it's actually why I sympathize with alex and funny thing is when Keller or what's his name I forgot it consumed him you notice immediately his stance changed I don't know if it was because the guy is dead or it's because he witnessed everything that Alex went through and he understands now I didn't play the second game only all of the first but I do know what Alex did to provoke that guy into killing him all I'm trying to say is I don't see Alex has a bad guy I see him as a broken Man
Better end than prototype 2
You gotta do ohma tokita vs baki hanma 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Funny how both characters were compared to Shadow the Hedgehog
I which Alex used the "Pack Leader" ability in this fight
This is the death battle we all been waiting for
Hm… on the one hand, my fav lost. On the other hand ,HOLY WOW THAT WAS AMAZING!!!!! This is one of the best videos in a while, the fight animation was excellent. This was a lot of fun and I loved it.
That was a great episode but the next one kind of scares me.
Ryu (Street Fighter) vs. Yusuke Urameshi (Yu Yu Hakusho)
Let's go cole won!!!
In the end...Good ALWAYS prevails!
Still waiting for saint seiya
death battle guy how about this fight goku vs doom slayer
Please do Sekiro vs Jin Sakai.
Your welcome
Yusuke Needs a death battle don't care against who
This is Amazing! We want Cole back to live as playable character in Infamous 4 and Alex is also back to live as playable character in Prototype 3!
I love how this feels like a ps3/xbox 360 style fight the two game vs game fights this season have been some of the best
I call hacks
The music was way, way too loud.
This is great but we all know the greatest cole vs alex was the drag off Yahtzee made the companies do way back when
Now hear me out, Kei Nagai vs. Sato, but instead of one of them dying, the winner is decided by who can permanently immobilize the other.
It should also be noted the "good" Cole, grew his powers to restore and conserve his energy so it's not even guaranteed that Alex could outlast him entirely either. That's not even considering his ability to absorb electricity from nearly everything.
Sooooo, can Megatron withstand casual planet level explosions at all? Cause if not, I’m confused here. 🤨
So is that rooster teeth logo now always gonna be there?
I loved this fight,and I'm not even a fan of these characters.  Now, I want to track down copies of their games. I also don't care too much for next time, but I do really like one of the characters and I'd love to see him get analyzed.
My winner is Cole macgrath he will beat up 2:10
Frieza vs megarton now thats something
This fight was such a treat. It really felt like a boss in either Series.
This fight had me on the edge of my seat! I was honestly worried that Cole might lose, but I'm so glad I was wrong. My boy's the GOAT.
So the comparison here between these two characters, and why they were pitted against each other since every deathbattle has a theme, is both were the main character of an original/awesome as hell game that had COMPLETE GARBAGE SEQUELS /sarcasm
I've been waiting for this battle for over 10 years now I was not disappointed it was worth it.
"Let's end this debate once and for all!" I missed that line so much!
the freiza vs megatron fight has me concerned on which megatron are they going to use and if they are going to ignore most of any the tv series for transformers which i remember the minibots and the ability to combine with other transformer
Damn right Cole won! I was going to call BS if he didn’t 💯
Oh my gosh freezer and megaton go fight each other in death battle 😱🤯🤩🤩😍😍
Grimlock vs Qrex
ゴジラVSウルトラマンをやってほしいです。
12:48 Listen for the “Let’s end this debate once and for all!”  I’m glad they brought it back!
My 13 year old self just pumped his fist unironically as the fight reached its' climax. I *knew* it! I was right, [SPOILERS] is cooler and tougher and stronger than [SPOILERS]!
God these games went so hard
Kinda sad we didn’t see evil cole tho
I honestly thought Cole was toast, I'm pleased he pulled it off. I still go back and replay those games every once in a while, they feel so awesome.
Love how we finally have another quality 3D fight. It’s been AGES! And this was AMAZING!
Hold on a second. With that next time teaser... Did the Transformers universe get an absolutely insane power boost since the time I used to watch the cartoon as a kid? Like, that match up looks like another SpongeBob VS Aquaman situation, from what I remember about Transformers.
God I miss the Prototype game SO much...
I was betting on Alex, because Yahtzee compared the games and said that Prototype (and Alex by extention) was just on a different scale.
OK, _now_ I'm interested in these franchises.
I grew up with both these guys and I loved both games of them!👍💯😎 this has got to be my favorite episode of death battle!!
Baki vs Ohma from kengan ashura
No mention of the DLC where Cole became a god damn vampire?
HELL YEAH ON THAT NEXT TIME PRAY TO PRIMUS THAT ITS GOING TO BE GOOD
Infamous 2 is my favorite super hero sim to this day. The Arkham and Spiderman games aren't bad. But the focus on stealth/melee makes me feel Idk less super. Meanwhile, Cole and Delsolin focus on their actual powers. I assume Alex and the guy from the second game are the same way. I never got to play prototype.
This was an awesome battle and plus they both have something in common they’re both games that are waiting for another sequel to their games and I hope they do finally one of them gets a sequel but now here’s a request for the next death battle that I would love to see the king of the underworld, Hades from record of Ragnarok versus muzan from demon slayer
Freeza vs Megatron... Why?
Nostalgia
Come on man. Please I beg you include Mazinger z in death battle.
A few disappointments with the fight:  They didn't give time for these characters to back off and showcase their ability to pretty much recharge. Maybe have some people for Alex to consume and something for Cole to absorb electricity from.  Another is they treated Alex's Devastator like it's nothing by immediately casting it
Frieza vs megatron, I am sorry this is a littaral one side, megatron gonna get scrap
Both have one common  They end in two games!  Dont have a third one!
i feel like this should of been a duel death battle with second son and prototype 2 lol could of been more amazing but this was the best time to be a gamer man i miss these days
Howard the duck vs Darkwing duck
YOOOO I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FIGHT FOR 10 YEARS!!! Thank you for finally making it (long after its relevance has passed like Boomstick said lol). But in all seriousness, I'm just glad I got to see it. Was rooting for Alex as I like shapeshifters, but I can see why Cole took the win. It was a great match-up. Can't wait for the next one, Freiza vs Megatron sounds LIT.
No surprise. Cole is manipulating a fundamental force of nature in ways that are purely theoretical, and in some cases, impossible. Mercer had no chance.
Wait, what I'm getting from this is ... our Broomstick is the good Boomstick?
We already knew which one looked better in a bra so this is just icing on the cake
When death battle post its a good day
Freiza vs Megatron man that's a hard match tbh
Nah i think Alex would win or even James Heller, but aye 🤷🏽‍♂️ still a good fight
Boomstick said, "You voted for it, so we're doing it." And I think, "I remember making a comment with thousands of likes that requested Alex Mercer vs. Carnage. Why is Cole here?"
"I love you brother, and I sure am gonna miss you."
I was rooting for Cole, but didn't think he would win. I'm happy to be wrong. For anyone wondering, I figured it was a question of if Cole could survive Alex's absorption, followed my power and durability questions.
Can we pls get Booker Dewitt on death battle, he can fight delsin rowe or someone else. Maybe the guy from atomic heart
5:20 “This trolley stops for no one!” Nice trolley problem reference
Why are we getting Frieza vs megatron theres plenty of better matchups for frieza
Next one should be Blackbeard from one piece vs Cervantes from soul Calibur
Can you guys do Gash/Zatch from Zatch bell vs someone don't really know who will be a nice match up for him.
Megatron’s throwing hands with Frieza?  This should be interesting…
We seriously need another Prototype Game
This one really took me back to better days.  👏👏👍
Interesting match up!
The hipster picture of Kirby with the soul bottle 😂😂
Ah! I wanted Alex to win!
sung jin woo please or max steel
Shame they didn't touch on what having biomass that dense would do to Mercer's bioelectric field. I mean, strictly speaking, wouldn't the sheer density of his flesh make him near immune to all but the strongest external currents?  Still, a beautifully animated and cinematic battle once again. I'm always looking forward to these lately.
You can tell this is an old script with all of Boomstick's ex-wife jokes 😂😂😂
Before watching the fight: YES THIS IS AMAZING!!!  After: OH GOD, OH MY GOD, OH YES, THIS WAS SO AWESOME!!!
This fight was wosome but i need a fight , baki vs jin
Conduits suck
he gave Alex quite a buff
I want this video to bring back infamous
Char Aznable would have make sense against Megatron since Amuro fought Optimus.
Freeza would squash Megatron point blank period!
The early 2010s cliche comedy was quite nostalgic. “That just happened.” “He’s right behind me, isn’t he.” Brought me back to horrible days people unironically said that.
I played both good and bad karmas in infamous I hate that Cole picks save normal people at the end as the cannon. I'm all for the evil ending in the second game. A raise to the new age.
ABSOLUTELY GOATED FIGHT PLAYED BOTH GAMES BUT IM GLAD COLE WON DESERVED
I find it really interesting that the outcome was partially determined by the scientific specifications of their abilities. I also like how they chose a specific version of Cole to use, rather than trying to composite the two versions like they usually do.
Wow I did not realise how powerful Cole is. So how come they made it him look slow and weak in the video game version?
Another thing that wasn't mentioned here is that even with everything that happened, Good Cole is implied to have possibly survived his self sacrifice, leaving the door open to him returning in the future if they ever continue the Infamous franchise.
Great fight. I thought Alex was far stronger, but clearly I was wrong, which suits me fine as  I wanted Cole to win.
This battle was not bad they seem pretty even with each other
i wonder what the next cole macgrath vs alex mercer will be
Alex getting killed in the second game is ass. He should of ate the player character for a a shock ending! It would of been amazing.
Guess this very old matchup was a zap from the past
No cap never heard of either  characters before and im not that young. Think it might be the first time i didnt know at least one fighter
Hey guys will you buy a game that says  play station vs Xbox
This made me so happy! You have no idea.
You should do this ones: -Nilou vs Azura (Genshin impact vs Fire Emblem) -Kirito vs Cloud Strife (Sword Art Online vs Final Fantasy) -Robin (male/female) vs Aether or Lumine (Fire Emblem vs Genshin Impact) -Corrin (male) vs Aquaman (Fire Emblem vs DC comics) -Lucina vs Trunks (Fire Emblem vs Dragón Ball Z) -Lyn vs Asuna (Fire Emblem vs Sword Art Online) -Asta vs Meliodas (Black Clover vs Seven Deadly Sins) -Anakin Skywaker vs Berkut (Star Wars vs Fire Emblem)
Lol they should do a fight between Bo-bo-bo and someone. Maybe bugs Bunny DK
I am so happy to see cole win because I grew up with the infamous series
Graphics hold up better then most AAA releases
These games weirdly hold the title of "superhero open world action game that i only played the first installment of"
Black frieza is gonna sweep.
Static Shock Vs Kauser Re4
I’m still surprised this episode took so long
Cole MacGrath the superhero his the Super Great Fighter
As a long time infamous fan, this video almost made a grown man cry. Love you DB
This definitely feels like a video written in 2013.
This was a great one
SPOILERS:    As a major inFamous fan I could not be happier 😂
Megatron is dead.
Wow very cool battle
Knew it would end like this as... well Alex Mercer in the second game was a downgrade of himself from the first game in all ways.  As for Freeza vs Megatron?  One followed a planet sized robot and struggled to beat it... The other one blew up planets before he got a Dragon Ball Super Buff.
Erico puchi (Jojo) VS flash (DC universo)
Next fight is Frieza vs Megatron, huh? A mostly successful galactic emperor that can blow up planets with no effort vs a rarely successful leader of the fascist side of a civil war that 100% cannot do the same. Who's ready for another One Sided Ass Kicking?!
Infamous! Wow! Does that bring back memories!
I may be a Prototype fan but I'm still glad Alex lost.
I think instead of Megatron it should be Unicron.  I understand it’s harder to find feats for him but it seems more fair.
Death Battle: The Turtle from the Amazing World of Gumball vs the Turtle from Family Guy
Nah
Dammit, I want Infamous 3
Starting off an episode only made possible via the support of some of your most dedicated fans by mocking the starring characters for perceived irrelevance… interesting choice.   Hope the battle itself was everything everyone wanted, I know I certainly enjoyed it.
Awesomesauce
Cmon guys. Where tf is SPIDERMAN 2099 VS PROWLER???!
Can someone give me the death battle discord link
I would like so see saints row vs crackdown at some point
hey Wiz and Boomstick, this is Kadyn-Greninja and i cant wait for the day Frieza takes on Megatron      because it's time for a DEATH BATTLE!!!!!!!!!!
the both will Be video games og at the end of the day 🙏
After I commented on Cole MacGrath's video for his part in Death Battle, you did actually place both his good and evil side effects of his powers and not to mention his recharge part. I want to thank you for that part.
My friend sent me this with no context but it was very enjoyable! I only know Cole from aforementioned friend’s ramblings so I was pleasantly surprised when I got to know more about him and how he did during the fight!
Nah I disagree. Alex definitely had the win. You can't just have a character survive a stab in the chest with a knife bigger than the entirety of your body and walk away, even someone like Homelander knows this. Boooo bad battle. Booo.
Suck Punch Productions is proud Infamous video game Cole Macgrath win death battle……
I'm a die-hard InFAMOUS fan (as you can tell from my PFP) I've played all the games countless times and you'd think I'd get bored of 'em after so many playthroughs but it's a franchise I grew up with and have great memories with and I desperately want either a remaster/remake of InFAMOUS 1, 2, and FoB (with UGC support from 2 and FoB) or a brand new InFAMOUS game with a  new protagonist or continuing Delsin Rowe's story from Second Son. I know Sucker Punch is focused on continuing to support Ghost of Tsushima and they are probably already making a sequel but they need to revive their old IPs because, if I recall correctly, Sly Cooper and InFAMOUS are the few PlayStation exclusive franchises that have not gotten remasters or remakes. Hopefully one day they can revive these VERY underrated franchises.
Frieza vs Megatron is not even fair
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN ABOUT! THAT'S WHY HE'S THE MVP! THAT'S WHY HE'S THE GOAT!! *T H E   G O A T ! ! ! !* jkjk I love both of these games to death, but with Alex's automatic healing I knew I'd be happier if Cole won😭😭
Yeah, about how I’d expected it to go for the past decade. Still! That was awesome
Why is frizea fighting megatron😂 frizea should fight someone stronger
Daaaaaaaaayum didn't see that comin'!  Thought for sure that Mercer had this one.  Also didn't see this comin': Frieza vs Megatron.  Wow...I hope Megatron's actually made of literally indestructible material or this is going to be a short fight.  Especially if they put him up against Black Frieza who is straight-up the most powerful being in his universe.  Like I'm sure there's some DEEP Transformers lore that I know nothing about that'll make this fight one worth watching...but Black Frieza is just absurd, even by Dragon Ball standards.
I know the next Death Battle is gonna be hype, but who asked for Megatron VS Frieza? 😅
Never knew Cole had the edge for this fight ⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️🔥🔥🔥🔥
Funny enough, I was tempted to pay to get a megatron song done so I’m so excited to hear that but damn rip megatron
im just saying baki vs ohma would be hype
Never played either of these games. Who voted on this? Why?
I love infamous so much!
If this was supposed to come out in 2013, then it would’ve been barely 10minutes
i really miss infamous wish it would be on ps5 or ps4 like prototype is
So we aren’t talking about the second one with him in Louisiana???
I know yall are sad that these games died and all, but its fricking FRIEZA VERSUS MEGATRON LES FricKIN GO
I was screaming for this match up for years
Dante dmc vs alucard castlevania sotn, do it
Generator Rex vs max steel
Wait... Frieza VS Megatron? What?
Yeah I'd agree with the reasoning to this out. Come, I may not like it but I agree with it.   I guess I'm just a sucker for the hero living long enough to see themselves becoming the villian cliche, that you get with prototype 1 & 2. Or like how in Infamous 2, Cole's sacraficing himself was just one route you could take, but doing so was not the story line route as we find out in second son, but did add an extra dimension to the story as a 'what if...' scenario.
Alex was made to become the most powerful being.   Cole was made to defeat the most powerful being.
Yea this episode is cap
Alex Mercer was basically Marvel's Carnage, but Cole is still a walking atomic bomb (or two depending on the game ending you go with). He just got erased at an atomic level.
I'm sorry, but no, cole surviving the Ray sphere explosion was NOT a feat. Infamous 2 established that any conduit can survive a point blank Ray field explosion. Bertrand did it and his power was bug related, not energy based. Cole was damaged after the blast because of shrapnel and rubble from the initial blast, not from the Ray sphere itself. Conduits are immune to Ray field radiation which is why they can't catch the empire city plague. Any conduit could survive the Ray sphere.
Deviantart called it. Regarding the next one, they did that too. Frieza won.
Amine Black Dynomite  vs the spy from the (adult swim) I forgot his name
0:25 This is where i fear most od the matchups for the champions pole come from 😂
I disagree, Alex had this in the bag.
16:00 - 16:01 "huh thanks for the tip"
I wish he would of went against James heller instead
Megatron is dead 💀
Hey death battle you should do black hat vs lord commander
Yes that was awesome nothing more to say lol
Hell yeah great battle
So Frieza wins the next death battle
"Alright the combatants are set let's end debate once and for all" haven't heard that for a long time
Any plans to do Rumble?
God i miss these kind of games! I need October to hurry up so we can play Spiderman 2
YES !!!! after all these years this match up finally happened !!  THANK YOU DEATH BATTLE !!!  This was a great episode !
It took me 10 whole years, but I finally have learned to enjoy the fight and not take the verdict seriously. And I love this fight.  7:34 What's that song? I really like Lofi  Who animated the fight? They kinda did a crap job. When Alex talked, his lips moved like one of Jeff Dunham's puppets. And there were moments I couldn't tell what was going on.
Static shock vs black suit spiderman 🤯
the next death battle is stupid.  you have a 5'3" alien with flesh fighting a giant robot that can't move as fast as lightning.
Looks like another requested Death Battle is happening next time.  I’m still waiting for XANA (Code Lyoko) vs Venjix (Power Rangers RPM).
What do you guys think of an Acnologia from Fairy Tail (dragon shifter) vs. Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty (dark fairy) Death Battle next?
Oh my god megatron vs frieza is a fight i will be waiting with joy
God I love how this captured the brutality of the games. One of the best battles
Choreography is a bit off but such a nitpick compared to the great music and production value
Prototype is one of my all time favorites
This came out at the perfect time! I was literally watching videos of these games over the last few days, and I’ve been debating on buying my friends PS3 to play the first two infamous games.
Good fight
This fight genuinely had me second guessing the victor.
I remember how Yahtzee from Zero Punctuation also challenged these two but by art wearing women's underwear. The devs from both actually submitted art and included a unicorn.
now im wondering if delsin row is capable of even more damage
Hold on, what galaxy busting abilities does Megatron have? Universe shatering?? How is he supposed to stand up to Black Frieza?!
Nah Alex would win.
We need g5 vs naruto
Good Cole sacrificed himself to bring an end to conduits.  Yet Second Son still happened.
oof this one hurt... Prototype  is my most favorite set of  powers in all of videogames. Maybe James Heler can get a shot at victory
Elsa vs Jack Frost pls❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
0:04 Start  0:39 Cole McGrath  6:42 Alex Mercer  12:58 Death Battle
If Frieza gets his Black form it’s over
How does Cole surviving molecular *deconstruction* prove he could resist *infection* from the black light virus? You can't scale those two things together, not to mention Cole *resisted* Sasha's Tar not completely unaffected, he would still be slowed down and harmed by the virus if Alex was able to at all touch him. Also the only reason Cole was able to defeat The Beast was because he was outright powered up by the RFI and he could only kill The Beast because the RFI's purpose was to kill conduits by draining their powers, you can't scale Cole to any of this because he's doing all this with the RFI boosting him not his own base strength. I still agree with the outcome but sucks to see such an anticipated fight not portrayed appropriately in typical Death Battle fashion.
I still say evil Cole had the better ending in Infamous 2. Best way to go is to play the hero all the way up until the end choice
I need to play Infamous and Prototype again pronto.
Oh well, Prototype was still a better game.
Str8 bs Alex is physically stronger and I don't remember Cole having healing abilities
If they are in a standard city Cole is gonna lose let's be honest here death battle..
Sigh! , i miss the days when people said alex Mercer  wins 😔
There must be a LOT of Transformers lore that I'm missing, because I can't imagine there being a scenario where Megatron is anywhere close to being even a nuisance to Frieza, much less a match.
Cole won? Cole WON!
James Heller vs Delsin Rowe (Prototype 2 vs Infamous Second Son)  I'd love to see this "spawn" match up!
MEGATRON WILL DESTROY FRIEZA!!
bro really pulled an uno reverse 😭
Imagine if it was Frieza vs Gemini Saga
Whose been waiting for this for 10 whole years? Raise your hands
LET'S GOOO! COLE MACGRATH FOR THE WIN!!!
This is literally another Ben 10 vs GL situation where the obvious winner should’ve won but nope i don’t get it Alex should’ve won it literally said Resistance Electricity plus he didn’t use any of his other powers and mind you the only other person to beat him was a person with his powers but what do ik not like i played both games
I like how most of cole's attacks are similar to shadow. Btw death battle you REALLY shouldn't be moronic in down playing shadow the hedgehog, that's how you get haters. ESPECIALLY the ben 10 vs green lantern video
Honestly just being a big virus being incased in a block of ice would have just forced him into dormancy forever or long enough for cole to just decide when he wants to kill him.
I like the next battle, but rip Unicron
I knew Cole would win this 😂 you gotta have played all the Infamous on both sides good & evil together
I was hoping Alex Mercer would win
I've been praying to see alex here for YEARS. Coolest super power ever and deserves another game
You need to do Ghost Rider vs. Spawn.  There, I said it.
As soon as someone says yea were not talking about this part of a character u know its one sided😂
I've Wanted this since that one Article on the Escapist was made with those 'Very Specific Fanarts' of Alex and Cole.
Gosh, these characters take me back to my cringy, edgy teenage phase...how I hated that.😂   (my edgy teenage phase, not the battle)
About time ive been waiting for this fight 😂, love the music and animation, but i do not agree with the victory but its whatever lol
i knew the fact he had the ability to absorb the bioelectricity inside anything living that was always coles ace in the hole
I am such a fan of the first PROTOTYPE, but the second one just didn't give anything fun for Mercer.  So I'm really not surprised by the conclusion.
Maybe one day, the first 2 Infamous games will get a re-release on modern consoles
Cole had a lighting  scepter bio steel is conductive still
Who’s truly more Human than Human?
Bugs Bunny vs Woody Woodpecker
Wait, there was a Movie of Infamous?! Was bad, right?
isnt eating turning matter to energy?
Is Grappler Baki popular enough to have Yujiro Hanma on Death Battle yet?
Thats the thing with infamous the good  path is a righteous one but the evil path they do so much more graining even more power
MY BOY COLE!! WOOOOO!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉
Do Kratos VS Doom Slayer
I played both of these games and I am pretty sure Alex Mercer was stronger! What type of Enemys did cole fight? Some mentally instable guys with a few super Powers. Alex fighted giant Monsters, Tanks and Chopers. The whole f*cking Army with Rocked Launchers. The Beast never used his Blast Attack in the Videogame because it would have been the end of Cole! Alex survived an Atomic Bomb!

Winner gets a PS5 sequel
2:15 you DID NOT just say Muffin Button 😂
I felt old knowing that these franchises are gone that long ago... but I felt amped up from that fight and battle music though! edit:(forgot to spell check)
I’m glad this fight happened it’s been one that people have talked about for years.  Both games defined a generation.  But I’m glad cole won. Good cole was always my favorite
YES! I’ve been waiting for this episode since high school, after years of debating with friends you guys finally brought it to reality. I was rooting for Cole the whole time
I still think Alex is kinda the clear winner here.  I don't think Cole can survive things like being decapitated, and he probably wouldn't take long to figure out how to absorb or short circuit cole and kill'em.
This episode is brought to you by E Coli
Heh, I never played Infamous but I DID play Prototype so I was rooting for Alex, but as the fight went on I started to become more neutral and by the end, I was rooting for Cole.
15:18 The delivery of that badass line, straight-up roasting his edgy foe while rejecting his offer, followed up by the siphon of electricity, the camera moving down from the tower, the brief violin note followed by the vocals, then the two preparing for an up close fight. This moment, this fight, is so epic.
Or do Timmy Turner Vs Twilight Sparkle (Fairy Odd parents Vs My Little Pony)
Anyone who grew up with a ps3 always had the thought of who would win between these 2
Ganon vs Sauron, Genji vs Snake eyes, shredder vs serpentor, deathsaurus vs mecha godzilla... Anyone else want to see these?
Man you guys are pumping these video's out fast af!
9:33 That’s Right Boomstick moment
ya basta freeeeeeeezeeeeeeer
Death Battle Should do Bowser Vs Lord Hater (Mario vs wander over yonder)
Just took a screenshot of the victory, that one's going in the book.
I'm so happy to see these two on DB! InFamous is an underrated series especially to me, so I'm glad he got some screentime on this show!
I haven't clicked on a death battle so quickly
This was truly the golden age of gaming. Also, great Death Battle.
Megatron vs freezer yeah you know they found some cracked out stats for Meg and say you kno we feel like he can box with black Air Force energy freeze FOH
I've been waiting for this for a long time.
Not surprised tbh, I was like “I’m rooting for Mercer but Cole is kinda cracked too”
18:29 Really of all Megatron match ups they had to choose the *WORST* one
Anyone noticed the TFS reference at 2:14 ?
Would of been cool to see Mercer consume him. Wonder what powers he would of gotten
can you guy please do luffy vs naurto
When is Inuyasha vs Rikuo Nura gonna happen
A good one would be Plastic man VS Luffy
oh my god please tell me you got Martin to voice Freeza
Please! Ms Frizzle  (Magic School Bus) vs Gaia (Captain Planet)!
I went into this thinking my boy Cole was fucked, but I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome, I always forget that when a person has lighting/electricity based powers they always end up being way more powerfully then you think, to be honest I completely forgot about the Bio-energy ability. and also I really liked the line "and what if he was facing Evil Cole, well it would have been way worse". Also I find it amazing and sai that this is the only example I know of where the players determined the canon by their actions. The writers and producers for InFamous didn't make the "Good Cole" the canonical ending, they looked at the PlayStation trophy system and looked at which trophy people got first "Fight the Good FIght" (the good ending) or "Forging Your Own Path" (the evil ending) and they saw the majority of people got the good trophy first, so for InFamous: Second Son, they went with the Good Ending to set the world in (but changed the fact that Cole didn't kill all of the conduits but most of them)
I was rooting for Alex during this fight but I knew he wouldn't win and this is for a reason they didn't even mention in the video and that is that Alex Mercer's 1 and only weakness... it's lightning/electricity it freaks out his maluble cells making him freak out if you don't believe me search it up.
This has been on my wantlist for so many years. Finally!-
Whoever did the animation for this. You good sir deserve a promotion.
About the next battle…  In two weeks… LET THE SLAUGHTER BEGIN!
One Death Battle I would love to see is Gardevoir VS. Fish Eye. I predict that Fish Eye will be voiced by Mike Dent.
Cole MacGrath win
I said the same thing for years the virus can't take over Cole. Not only because of the whole Sasha tar thing. But also the fact Cole body can't be altered. The Beast can create a freaked black hole that tears apart everything on an Atomic level. Yet if Cole gets caught in it he doesn't get tear apart. Joseph Bertrand corrupted ability also has no effect on Cole. Plus Cole electricity covers every part of his body. Including his cells and even atoms. The virus can't adapt to his DNA if it can't reach it. The electricity will fry the virus before it could. Before any of you say oh well couldn't the virus adapt to electricity. No. Because you see Cole electricity is special. It can effect beings who have a complete invulnerable to electricity. Kessler, David and the Beast. So even if the virus created a invulnerable Cole electricity can bypass it. Cole wins.
Dante VS Bayonetta REMATCH (Devil May Cry VS Bayonetta)
I like both characters but man I wanted Alex to win this so bad
Cole is basically white Static Shock
I'm so happy this won the champion poll be fans waited 10 years for this mu I'm so happy for the community
One of the death battles I never expected to see but hoped it would happen. I enjoyed prototype because of the Shapeshifting (which is my favourite superpower) and I also liked infamous. I missed playing those games. I was rooting for Alex but in the end Cole put a shock to Alex’s system.   Guyver vs Iron man is another one of the  battles I hoped to see. I gonna be biased and say Guyver.
Frieza vs Megatron? What is that matchup? I mean, they both can survive in space, so Frieza blowing up a planet wouldnt matter that much but does Megatron actually got enough power to not be ripped apart by gold Frieza?
That ending was a joke, Mercer dove on a nuke to save NYC. If you're gonna have a lame ending where Cole wins, at least give Mercer a proper ending.
Am i only one who doesn't like how they do some game characters. In this game cole has 2 games worth of powers, with the sequel expanding on this since that's how characters through more than one game work, where mercer has a single game. the playing field wasn't fair to start with. yes they are both original protagonists to their series, but one clearly has a larger arsenal to counter. are they intentionally skewing these fights, like the chosen undead vs dragon born was clearly a skewed fight, since they put a 2nd in series character (game released 2 years after 1st souls game) against a 5th in series character (released 17 years after 1st elder scrolls game). I don't care who wins, but can the match ups at least make sense in terms of point in timelines, and games worth of arsenal.
This one of the best fights this season! 🎉
...Wonder how well Mercer would fare against Wesker.
I've seen people say that most characters on Death Battle would get along. These two, however, isn't one of them.
Rimuru vs Ainz Ooal Gown🥹
This really makes me wanna play infamous and prototype again
AWESOME SAUCE
I really thought Alex would have this fight.  But im satisfied with the outcome either way.  I have a fond memory of both of these franchises. Wish we could get sequels.
Spoiler Shield 🛡️
We need goku vs one punch man already
Saiki K from 'The Disastrous Life of Saiki K' vs. Wang Ling from 'Daily Life of the Immortal King'  Yujiro Hanma from Baki vs Akuma from Street Fighter  Cocain Bear vs Yogi Bear?
Frieza vs Megatron. The issue is Frieza’s black form doesn’t have enough detail in manga whether this form can surpass or equal to Goku’s Ultra Insticts.
Unless I am deeply missing something megatron is gonna get absolutely stomped. Like worse than homelander
Alex mercer voice  sound like mortal kombat 1 bi han
If we're going back to past scripts, how about Ghost Rider vs Scorpion?
I wonder if they'll ever do something like Buffy the Vampire Slayer vs Juliet Sterling from Lollipop Chainsaw
“Read your mind like Goku’s Muffin Button” huh ok
Blacklight adapts in the comics iirc he can adapt to gravity real quickly, on top of him being a living virus that infects people. also if he had enough time he could gain a partial absorption on coal and have some of his powers.
Where'd you get that muffin?  Mmmmmuffin button
Took you long enough
Damn ya like 13 years late
Wow I honestly didn't  think Cole would survive Alex
Yeah... they got this one wrong. Cole wins in energy projection, but from a gameplay and lore standpoint, Alex is far more powerful, versatile, and outright destructive. He's a literal one man army. From any point after he absorbed Greene, up until his death, he was out of Cole's league.
Doom eternal vs new master chief
This is a massive shot of nostalgia for me. Two of the first 4 games I had for PS3 were Infamous and Prototype.
Alex got the real death in the second game where they killed his character.
death battle just let me say thank you for the amazing muffin button reference
I've been saying this on and off for a few years now. I'd love to see them do a battle between Michael Knight and KITT vs Speed Racer and the Mach 5.
Sony finally got a single victory (Kratos, Jak, Dexter, Sweet Tooth & Nathan Drake)-(not including Ratchet & Clank) in Death Battle!
Muffin button! What an awesome reference.
I was disappointed when they weren’t going to use Evil Cole but when they said determined Alex wouldn’t even be able to compete with Evil Cole I was like “alright that’s cool but I still wanna see it” 🤣
Freeza vs Megatron is gonna be pretty one sided tbh
Samaritan vs Hancock
Cole is the goat 🐐
Should’ve used evil cole
This was way cooler than it deserved to be
I really hated how they shifted Alex to be more of a villain in Prototype 2. He was perfect as an anti-hero.
FINALLY!!!
We just going to ignore all the impaling Cole suffered?
This was so goddamn cool
A "Well, that just happened!" and "He's right behind me, isn't he?" both in one episode, I see why this script was in the trash
SLAYYYYYYYYYY
This one surprised me. Despite the fact I liked Cole better, I thought Alex was gonna win this one. When you guys broke it down, it made sense.
They made a clone of “Time Huh? Thanks for the tip.” BUT ACTUALLY BADASS
I really can’t believe the winner I seriously can’t ……
Honestly, I'm just glad these two franchises get to be in the spotlight again.  I would LOVE it if [PROTOTYPE] finally got that 3rd game that was planned before the studio was dismantled and absorbed into Activision.
Well, that was unexpected...
Freeza vs Megatron? Black Freeza has this laughably easy.
They have been left ambiguous for now….who knows what happened to the both of them now  The beast vs annihilation(no index)
It be so funny if this makes Activision and Sucker Punch continue their games franchises just so they can make sure their character is the most powerful
Yea megatron is scrap… FREIZA can causal bust planets
Look…. If they remaster Infamous 1 and 2 then sell the complete bundle for like $32-$40 I’m In! Just saying lol.
OMG At last! After so many seasons...finally frieza is next
i would think that Alex would steal enough of Cole’s DNA in a stab to begin evolution toward electrical immunity
Sorry the “Ohhh like shadow the hedgehog!!” Had me weak every-time! 😂😅
Literally knew the ending of this fight way back in 2012.
i do not remember for sure but i think there was a 3rd potential MC hinted at in P2?? like in the lore or something like that (i do not remember all the way its been a long ass time) so i think they could bring the series back to its root
Ben 10 vs transformer
This is one of the few fights on this channel I don't care who wins
DB does a good job giving full analysis of the two video game protagonists and speaking of protagonists, Alex is more experience than Cole and can regenerate however Cole's powers are way deadlier & creative that include his Radar Pulse which can detect invisible enemies even when they transform & Bio Leech allows him to recover if he injured by draining nearby electric sources (Good Cole) or people tho (Evil Cole)   And also I'm giving this episode a 9 out of 10 because the music that match the combatants really well thus fitting the “Either you die as a hero or live long enough to see yourself as the villain” memo and choreography of the fight perfectly executed btw. It's a great DB💯👍👍👍
Istg if Frieza somehow loses to Megatron 😂 y'all better have a good ass explanation
this is so ps3core
So glad my prediction was wrong.
I thought this was gonna be one-sided... actually got surprised...
I wish they would go back and remake the first Prototype but give it the personality and more alive feeling of the 2nd one. you have all these amazing powers but with how basic the overworld is in P1 its kinda for nothing since the tentacle boys or just genrally interesting enemies are disabled and hunters are not that interesting.  You can see how much it potential it had in every movement Alex makes and how many unique interactions he had with parkour and so many skills but  no one to challenge you meaningly
I feel like it should have been evil Cole versus the prototype guy
wow, ok i wanna see this megatron vs frieza hope they do 3d for it and not 2d
For Alex, this was the fight of his life.  For Cole, It was Tuesday.
These 2 games on todays console would be something to behold, especially infamous 😔 sadly that'll never happen
13:03
Frieza vs Megatron is next.....sorry Transformers fans....
So this was a script written back in 2013? Explains the frequency of ex wife jokes from boomstick being told more than usual
Predator vs batman
Well, the fight now exists. We got what we wanted after 10 years of waiting. Now what?
Now if only we could get another Infamous and Prototype game
I say this as someone who loves both Prototype games, Alex Mercer's the worst and I'm glad he's dead.
YEEEEAAHHH MY GOAT WON!!! i was worried a little bit because usually the second person who's introduced usually wins but i just know my goat would beat him.    *spoilers*  I thought they would fuse good and bad cole but that would be overkill
Next time on deathbattle... Megatron is f**ked!
Booo!!! Booo!!  👎👎
These characters are the quote "You either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain"
Gosh I missed my Edgy boy Alex Mercer.
Now we just need the Adachi vs kira
Man I loved how they did this fight in 3d their 3d fights are always really badass and well done and this Is a matchup they should have done years ago I'm glad they finally did it now all they have left 2 do is Galactus vs unicron and make that 3d with the armada game unicron and ultimate alliance 1 character models and it will be the most ridiculously badass awesome thing ever
Freiza Vs Megatron? That’s gonna be a friggin wash. Freiza was destroying planets with a single finger in his first form upon his introduction. Megatron could only threaten the destruction of planets by manipulating and controlling cybertronians stronger than him.
Hah. I thought our Boogie Man was going to win. Guess he needed to absorb a few weaker super heroes first to even things out.
Video idea: starkiller (star wars) vs Storm (X-men)
Hell yes. I won that bet
FRIEZA VS MEGATRON???!!!
Whhhhhhoooooooaaaassaaaaa
Wasn't expecting that
This is what I've been waiting for
inFamous was my 1st game i ever played when i got a PS3 and i loved the series man, cole has been my favorite PS character since then i was like 12, damn I'm happy to see my man cole getting love, now lets hope they do a deathbattle with Delson cause hes pretty broken
Alix got this (this is before watching) After :huh
I had absolutely no faith in cole and I’d like to apologize. Love you cole sorry cole thank you cole
Alex would wipe the floor and do the  dishes with cole
Oop one detail missed. Viral Gas Generation. Mercer is able to produce a gas that infects people. Cole can be effected by gas meaning that it'd be a matter of time before Cole looses himself to the infection that would slowly destroy his body over time which does mean that his mind would become weaker and weaker as the battle goes on making it easier and easier for Mercer to consume him.
Krillin vs Akuma
Bumblebee from DC vs wasp from marvel
COLE BEHIND OYU
If it makes any salty Alex fan boys feel any better. James Heller can beat the crap out of Delsin Rowe. So there is your Olive Branch. Take it.
@12:50 I Love the Return of "Let's End this Debate Once & For All"  I HAVE REALLY 🐬🐬🐬🐬ING Missed hearing Wiz Saying that Classic Line!!
When i saw the next time i thought it was going to be galactus vs unicron and got excited. But im fine with megatron vs frieza
finn the human vs steven
I always knew Cole was better. I also just straight up never enjoyed Prototype though. Kinda ironic, Alex FEELS stronger in games, what with him tossing tanks, but he also never holds back like good Cole does.
Should’ve been Alex Mercer Vs Carnage. Then it really would’ve been a hell of a fight.
I will say this will be an Infamous battle
Megatron va frieza is gonna be a massacre
2:08 “Look at little Spider Man Jr. Gonna cry?”
Starkiller vs Cole macgrath would be sick
Now we need james heller.
Wow. We got a, “That just happened,” AND a, “He’s right behind me, isn’t he?” in a single episode. Stay winning, guys. Writing is super easy, isn’t it?
How yall gonna just slip that TFS reference in there 😂
So death battle version of this fight made cole win. It was meh but remember death battle don't have the final say lmao
Shrek vs thanos
You know the aforementioned script is old when Wiz says, "Let's end this debate once and for all!"
Never did get around to playing Prototype back in the day, but I was a major fan of inFAMOUS and very much aware of how the two series were compared to each other. So this made me smile.
This is actually the most nostalgic death battle and they’re argument is shockingly accurate.  Like I’ve been mentioning the actual raw power difference and bio leeching for years and mfer’s still thought Alex would win. And here it is in death battle
One thing I really appreciate about most fights is how close it seems - Each character gets to show off and shine, making you realize what each person's advantages are as the fight goes on, and making you wonder how the other is going to get out of it, or at least try to, and even when it does simply come down to who can hit the hardest, run the fastest, take the most tons of TNT to the face or whatever, it still feels like a fairly even fight where they really have to push the limits of what they can do
Technically, Cole would have been infected once Alex stabbed him
Cole can keep winning the battle, but Mercer wins the war.  You can't perma-kill someone that infectious.
Okay, so, admittedly I'm not a fan of either game or character, never played either of them, never got into it but all that being said I have to also admit that this...was easily one of the most badass thing I've ever seen in my entire life. And this took ten years to finally happen so to the true fans, I hope it was worth the wait.   Next time: NICE! They're finally getting Frieza vs Megatron out of the way too! I know a lot of fans have been asking for that one for a long time too and I've been waiting for Megatron to appear in a Death Battle ever since Wings of Iron. No, I don't count Rainbow Dash vs Starscream because it was just plain sad.
🎉👏 One final round of applause to the Season 10 Champion's Ballot winning Matchups: Bill Cipher VS Discord and Cole Macgrath VS Alex Mercer!🎉👏     And to the Matchup's winners Bill Cipher and Cole Macgrath, Congratulations on your hard-earned victories!
Okay hold up, Frieza vs Megatron ?! Is this a stomp fight or does Megatron have feats I'm unaware of because I've never heard of Megatron casually blowing up damn planets with zero effort because Frieza can do that in his weakest form.
Let’s get Goku vs Superman 3
Okay they officially run out ideas when they put together death battles between absolute random characters for them to fight against each other. Talking about the next death battle.
Nope. Next
This was basically "What If Venom fought a competent Electro"
Hell yeah 🔥👍🏽
in before a prototype Reboot gets announced
As a huge fan of both games, you guys did not disappoint. Regardless of who won, I'm just happy this Death Battle even happened. And this fight was AWESOME, by the way.
You did your best, Alex. You did your best.
Now we need the sequel (Delson Rowe vs James Heller)
Do Mamoru Takamura (Hajime no Ippo) VS Eikichi Onizuka (GTO) next
What kind of idiots  Megatron vs what?
Igneel or ignia vs black fatalis
So this is just Static Shock vs Carnage. Got it
2:14  Cole: "bored now, reading your mind." (Muffin button 😂😂😂)
Wow dudes & dudettes just wow now this Death Battle was everything I ever dream of and the whole thing was down right so awesome but I already knew that Cole MacGrath would win by taking Alex Powers by absorbing the whole thing such as the powers and that ended Alex now that was super awesome and I can't wait for the next Death Battle Episode between: [Frieza From DBZ Series Vs Megatron from Transformers Series] now that one is going to be even more awesome not as awesome of this idea that Death Battle Company should least think about it such as the battle between two Watet Maideds and I'm talking about: [Katara From Avatar The Last Airbender Series Vs Juvia Lockser From Fairy Tail Series] now that sounds like a awesome idea that the Death Battle Company least think about it knowing it totally be awesome in DBX or Death Battle whichever works don't you think so dudes & dudettes.!?¡¿ ♤♡♧◇€£₩¥☆
Have someone fight star killer
This is a lie
Anti-Hero vs Anti-Villain
That was a curb dump in the opposite direction of what I thought it was going to be
I know alex wins because of the virus. I WANT cole to win, despite how cool alex is and how fun he (probably) is to play, but I just gotta root for the bad guy on this one. sure, alexcould get his life electricity sucked, but his cells probably don't have that... right? edit* I was wrong. leaving this so I can be made fun of.
frieza vs megatron isn't even fair
I absolutely adore both of these games, this match-up was incredibly entertaining and deffinetly brought back some memories.
Jimmy Neutron vs. Dexter  Human Torch vs. Cinder The Avengers vs The wildCATS
Muffin BUTTON
That ps3 era of fun crazy badass same haircut protagonists was awesome, such fun games. Pretty interesting only 1 version was use, i can see why since all 3 versions together would've been to much for alex.
I got a match up, Galactius vs Unicron
nice video, shame only about Alex's defeat (I know that Alex is evil, unlike Cole, in the good guy run, but the former's powers have always fascinated me), I thought he beat him because of his adaptability (even if It's bad to say, but couldn't he absorb people nearby to strengthen himself?). Bye
Day 1 of asking for some to fight Kratos
Do unicorn vs galactus
First of all my boy Cole won YES  Second of all FRIEZA vs MEGATRON @&$% YES
Kratos vs doom slayer death battle
But wait Cole was killed and Alex wasn't so how that make sense. Cole is weak as a human where as Alex is beyond any strength that Cole could use because while the thing that gave him powers vaporized everyone else Cole doesn't have that power

Once you hear the amount of tnt somebody takes and produces, you know they’re gonna lose
18:20 If anyone thinks Frieza vs Megatron is a terrible matchup, raise your hand and give me DB opponents that you feel would be a better fit against the Leader of the Decepticons
After all these years and the answer is just wrong.
New favorite death battle. Worth the wait.
Alex literally shouldve won no biased no joke he should've since that nuke literally messed him up would've messed him up at the atomic level and yall didn't add that? And his body survived THAT, also how is cole gonna get the electronic stuff when alex IS A DEAD BODY?! are you guys gonna pay ANY attention??
18:31 This is how you can tell death Battle is running out of ideas.
How long have fans been asking for this? Over ten yeas!?!?
I hope that wasn't a jab at Linkin park 😑
NGL. I voted for Coke. But I don’t like either one of em for some reason 😂
Легендарные игры
Unicron vs Galactus is one I'd love to see.
What if Alex uses his shapeshifting to turn himself into an innocent bystander and ambushes Cole, though.
Anos vs Rimuru?
The real question is who is faster to absorb
I...wh...Frieza vs Megatron? Wh...why? Other than purple tyrant?
CHOKE ON COPIUM HATERS! THIS BATTLE WAS AWESOME 13/10 13/10 BEST FIGHT! BEST FIGHT!
Luffy vs Naruto ?
This was absolutely amazing...  But now they need to do megamind versus mojo jojo.......
one punch man vs gokuone punch man vs goku
Frieza vs Megatron smh....one thing to say to that "Black Frieza exists" just don't do it.

I like how this battle Loved that Cole won as a hero  Sad That Alex turned and Died a Villain but I'll Remember him when he had Some Good in his heart

Frieza vs Megatron?! Weird matchup, and I simply cannot see how the outcome is anything but the most one-sided fight in Death Battle history.

I never thought I'd see the day where Frieza has beef with Megatron
so both of these people are what if spiderman became shadow the hedgehog

Great work on this Death Battle, even if my guy lost.  I’m worried about the next one though. I’m rooting for Megatron but Dragon Ball characters are ridiculously overpowered.

Frieza bodies Megatron
I’m sorry, Frieza? Vs Megatron?  Who’s idea was that.  I’m a fan of both franchises, and in all honesty it’s Megatron that’s gonna get turned into scrap metal by Frieza.
Now we need the ƙid from second son and the guy from prototype 2.
Ok, Frieza VS Megatron is a no contest, Frieza will obliterate Megatron, as much as I hate too say that since they’re two of my fave cartoon Villains.
I had my money on alex Mercer. Nit mad he lost tho
Please let megatron defeat frieza. Frieza is weak to anti matter. That is something megatron can take advantage of
Next time...  Tyranny rulers meets head on in the epic clash of death battle! Frieza VS. Megatron!
Now we need Delsin vs James
Chucky (Child Play) vs Evil Leprechaun
15:59  - 16:21 😮😮
That "Good idea" line was so raw
Literally alex stomps and they gave no actual status how strong he was and one of the fastest analysis on a character, literally it's shorter than Vegeta on Vegeta vs Thor and that SUPER faster literally FU Death battle you biased mf's and I hope you understand how stupid you guys can be just by adding the comic stuff of Alex and NOT adding everything from it seriously the only thing cole had going for him was SPEED
G WHAT IS THIS FREIZA VS MEGATRON MATCH UP 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
WOW. I honestly thought Alex had this with his Absurd Healing factor and didn't think cole's energy atomization was on the same level As Delsin's, Fetch's, Eugene's and etc. where they could just Disintegrate people where I thought Cole couldn't be on the same power cloth.  Proved me wrong ig
Soemrhing id like to add I dont really know the other guy as i havent played infamous But when alex wounds cole, as that points hed be able to absorb his dna, not consume him, but absorb hus dna At that point hed be able to inherit coles ability or at the very least the virus would evolve and adpat like it does to other threats and circumstances? Also, I'd have thought being as clever as he is, alex would probably want to fall back when he starts having a hard time vs coles abilities, in the games, alex spends alot of time stratergizing and preparing and accumularing knowledge, realistically, if cole was a genuine threat to him, hed want to try figure cole out before taking him on head to head like in this video  I may well be wrong as like I say i havent okayed infamous but just some thoughts
MAN!!! THIS fight was BEAUTIFUL and somewhat nostalgic. Love how yall animated this and the fight choreography. It makes me miss the 2010s Vibes and era of Gaming.....like fr ive been requesting this fight since 2014😂😂😂almost 9 years  Aside from that,Love the interaction between these two, which alone gives alot of applause👏🏼
I hope next time I get to see a death battle of Marc ecko's getting up vs Jet Set Radio
how about freddy cougar vs darkrai: battle of dreams 😮
Next one looks rather obvious. There must be something I'm missing. Is G1 comic Megatron wildly more powerful and competent than his cartoon counterpart? Cuz Frieza blows up planets in "5 minutes" which lasted dozens of episodes. The worst Megatron ever managed to do was strip mine a planet over a 5 million year war of incompetence.
Cole Macgrath is much more powerful than what they think.  Kessler make the Raysphare to be stronger than in the Future Timeline, then we see that the Beast in the Future have destroyed the Moon as well, and by the Raysphare being stronger then the Future Timeline, also means that The Beast in the present is stronger than the Future Timeline one.  Cole also has a Feat of dodging actual beams of Radiation.  Cole Wins this for sure, but he is far more powerful than what he seems here.
Yoooooooo Alex mercer
Not enough love for the music in this one. When either gets the upper hand in the fight it switches. Nice touch
All right! Cole won!
Animation was a bit rough, but all together it was a good death battle
When are you making a goku vs super man rematch
The fact that Wiz said "Let's end this debate once and for all" instead of "We've run the data through all possibilities" tells you how old that script was. 😅  Absolutely amazing fight. Extremely glad Cole got the W.
Black hat vs the lich  (Villainous vs adventure time)
Good job Cole😍🔥💪
I think this battle forgot one thing which they even stated as one of his abilities and that is Alex's intelligance. They stated that Alex has some serious intelligence and reaction time but he acts rather dumb in this fight, If he gets hit by Cole's electricity wouldn't he have been able to analyse parts of it to know partly what it is at least and realise that Cole will not be beaten through consumption and that he should kill him another. Also that whole "join me" thing I don't see Alex doing with Cole since he knows nothing about him in this death battle and I'm sure he only would do that with people he's researched (Heller being an exception mainly because of plot I think). This my opinion on why I think the fight shouldn't have been Cole's victory.
day 1 for pls stain vs garou from one punch man vs my hero
I was betting on cole winning but I was hoping alex would win
This battle was between two games I never got to play but really wanted to.
I'm glad my boy Cole won but y couldn't we've gotten evil Cole's story and power evil Cole is so much stronger in his abilities
I grew up playing Prototype and never played infamous so I was definitely biased going in, but I have to admit when my favorite loses. Alex went out like a badass, dying to karmic justice in a move I have to respect
Sooooo next Death Battle we have a Super powered alien vs a robot.      I'm sorry did we forget Rainbow Dash destroyed Starscream last time?????
WE NEED INFAMOUS SECOND SON DELSIN ROWE IN DEATH BATTLE TOO
I sure hope the comments don’t spoil anything
The music and song made the fight even better.
Can’t Alex also make biomass monsters (in the second game)? Could be misremembering, but could also see it as just ruining the spirit of THE DEATH BATTLEEEE 1v1
What bothers the hell out of me is that we don't get these types of games anymore, I'd kill for a Remake of both inFAMOUS 1 & [PROTOTYPE] on Modern Consoles right now & given the same love and Care treatment Motive Studio did for Dead Space remake game over at EA, that at least I'm super grateful. 2009 was magical year.
Well done buys👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I am pleasantly surprised by this outcome. I figured it'd be super one sided (I forgot just how powerful the winner truly is).
I've been waiting since I was a kid for this video to come out and I relished every sequence of this video. Thank you making this a dream come true ❤
Ah, these guys takes me back to the years 2008 - 2010 days
I think Buffy the vampire slayer vs Jessica Jones might be a good match
I thought we would’ve gotten this a decade ago 😂
for those who dont know Cole "bad way" end was actualy mean to be the true canon eding when infamous 2 was made (which is more logical because Cole survive in this one) and was latter non canon when the 3 game came because some think it would add be not good with the charactere and can make a solt reboot
I loved this death battle. good show, a jolly good show
I'm glad we got to see Prototype series in action
anybody else just see freeza wiping the floor with megatron? (talking about the next Death Battle)
Good death battle but come on that would end differently
You know you could have just pulled a Smash 4 and pretended something else won if you hated the idea this much
So playstation wins this fight
But who would look better in ladies' clothing?
How exactly does Cole resist the blacklight virus? It doesn't rip people apart, it infects and rewrites their DNA Like a virus. He's been demonstrated vulnerable to having his body modified, like when he was turned into a vampire.  I feel like that's a flimsy point though obviously without that resistance Alex wins easily.
Luffy Vs Plastic Man
GAROU VS BAKI IS GOING TO BE MIND BLOWING🗿
I gotta be honest, I didn't think Cole would win, even though that would be my preference. Glad that I was wrong. Kinda curious how Delsin would fare, with his abilities to deform and reform himself (even the clothes) and not only absorb, but use other conduits' powers...but this is good enough.
YYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSS!!!!!!!🫨🫨🫨🫨👏👏👏👏👏
Do SpongeBob vs Buu next
Rick O Connel ( Mummy) vs Henry Jones Jr (Indiana Jones)
I was 14 when these games came out, to see this video brings a smile to my face.
As someone who has never played any infamous games or prototype this battle was very fun to watch and really made me want to play those games
I was going to ask why didn’t they use evil Cole, then I realized almost immediately. It would’ve been over, almost immediately
Looks like Cole and Raiden (Metal Gear) has something in common, they now fought and won againts an edgy clawed opponent with crazy regeneration ability
WHERE HAS THIS BEEN MY WHOLE LIFE! HOW DARE YALL SIT ON THAT FOR 10 YEARS IT WAS A FACEOFF MEANT TO HAPPEN
they brought back the line. thank god
HTF NEXT
I been wanting this death battle for so long thank you for this fye video🔥🔥🔥
This is the type of battle scene I like. A lot of money and work but all fights should be this animated.
Cole: Thanks for the tip.
Alex: Fought an opponent with similar abilities and lost Cole: Fought the superior version of himself and won
I Still need a death battle with Mumm-ra The ever living!!!!!!!! Maybe mumm-ra vs skelator. I'd also like to see a death battle with the Lunatacs from thunder cats
I was asking for Alex Mercer vs Jackie Estecado but eh, I'll take this
We need Kratos vs Liu Kang pls
Ohma tokita vs baki Hanna (kengan ashura vs glapper the baki) is gonna be sick
I did not see that coming.
Plastic Man (Patrick "Eel" O'Brian) vs Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic)
I know it was meant as a gag, but Boomstick's rant about what's more human than consuming the planets resources & crowning yourself king isn't exactly wrong😅
Despite having played Infamous 1 and 2 I thought Alex had this fight... colour me surprised!
Havent even watch this but mercer washes cole.
Springtrap (Five Nights Freddy vs Imhotep(The Mummy🎉
I wanna see unicron vs galactus.
Hell ya Cole won. Infamous was fun as heck
We need a Delsin rowe (infamous second son) vs Spider-Man ps4 would be so dope
I absolutely loved learning about these two since I knew very little about Alex and even less about Cole.
Cole is basequely électro simulator where Alex is basequely Carnage simulator
That was probably one of the best Deathbattles i've seen in the last couple of years
I already knew cole was going to win because I played both games
Thank you.  ALWAYS WANTED THIS‼️ Thank you.
Are we going to overlook the TFS reference? Oh, muffin button...
Like the episode... Hate the music. To loud and distracting. Doesn't match the action.
Who else owned both of these?! Or even the whole series of both.
asome battle
I’ve waited since this channel was established for this day!!!
This was Awesome!
:)
I was rooting for Alex, mainly because I love the Prototype games, but I'm not surprised by the outcome. Cole definitely had the power to actually kill Mercer.
Winner🏆cole macgrath i like it this lightning powers hands😠💪🖐⚡💥amazing superhero🦸‍♂️❤🎉👌i love it lnfamous okay sorry? Boomstick wnd wiz guys don't lose in yourself this we won🏆lnfamous amazing this cloe macgrath lightning powers😠💪🖐⚡💥i like it superhero🦸❤ okay we won🏆wiz cole macegrath i like it this lightning powers hands🖐⚡death battle! Okay death battle! Cole wins🏆⚡❤
the edgy electric vs the edgy gore
the two  in this death battle  is basically " you either die a hero, or live long enough to become a villain"
Finally, after all these years. And it was beautiful.
I love the fact that Cole didn't even need to fully power up.
what irked me the most in this fight was the lack of alex using his busted spikey sheild to block and stab at cole, also like how tf did his blades not cut through coles stupid little electric baton. there were a TON of missed abilities alex could’ve used. would’ve loved to see him use pack hunter and 3 v 1 cole, or when they crashed into the building he could’ve mimicked a civilian to get the suprise on cole. fight was good but short and had alot of missed opportunities. im curious though, wouldn’t cole consuming alex infect cole and cause alex to emerge from him? only reason heller didn’t get messed up was cause he was already infected… but for someone whos non infected consuming the deadliest virus known to man… that’d definitely have consequences. inb4 “his electricity makes him immune” yeah i think the scientists in alexs universe would’ve tried neutralizing the virus with electricity. definitely didn’t work for them.
The emperor of mankind vs someone around that powerful
Now do Delsin Rowe vs James heller
Frieza vs. megatron? I'm not well versed in transformers power scaling, but could someone please explain to me how megatron doesn't get no diffed?
Muffin button.
Im wonder if they're gonna do a episode of Captain Rex vs general ironwood
Anyone think it’s awesome that they used a dlc power for Cole?
Well, both games were fun, so eh.
O próximo comboio que vai ser Freeza vs Megatron.... mas vou fazer minha aposta.. Lord freezer
As a player from both series and an individual who has once requested this fight, the wait was well worth it. They (the developers) need to remaster these games.
Finally put a 10 year old debate to rest for me and my friend, he liked infamous while I preferred prototype. I mean Alex died canonically anyway to James Heller (spoilers) so I don’t even care but this was cool to finally watch happen and the animation is really good.
Called it!
Finally
This death battle was dope as hell!!!!!!!!!!!
I wonder which version of Megatron will they chose. They showed multiple version of him in the preview.
boomsticks reaction to knowing e=mc2 is my reaction to knowing this match up
Ideas for Deathbattle or DBX. Galactus vs Unicron (They probably are already doing this one). Brock Samson vs Jonathan Archer Aragorn vs Conan the Barbarian Motoko Kusenagi vs Aeon Flux (probably better as a DBX) Meruem from Hunter x Hunter vs............well, whomever you can think of, because Meruem is amazing. Sabertooth from Marvel vs Cheetah from DC. The Tick vs Freakazoid. Pinky and the Brain vs the Rescue Rangers. Devastator from Transformers vs Alexandrite from Steven Universe Mojo Jojo vs Dexter boy Genius (if not Dexter vs Jimmy Neutron {and they both murder johnny test in collateral damage}) Megas XLR vs Gurren Lagann............ok, Gurren Lagann will win (DBX this idea) Mummra vs Skelator Tron vs Bob from Reboot .........and, if you really want to make your writers suffer.............Rick Sanchez vs Doctor Who. That might not enrage people like Superman vs Goku, but it will be up there.    REMAINDERS. You find your own pair offs. Hellboy, Sailor Moon, Dr Manhattan, The Savage Dragon, Hitgirl, Captain Planet, Jenny the teenage robot, Doofenschmirts, White Beard from One Piece, Big Mom, Golden Bat, Darna (Philippine super heroine), Asterix and Obelix, Cyber 6 (YOU NEED MORE INTERNATIONAL CHARACTERS OUTSIDE AMERICA AND JAPAN ANYWAY).....
Yeah😊
A bit strange how Mercer didn't go for more stabbing and piercing attacks off the front
Just checking can megatron blow up a planet with his finger? 🤔🤔
Hell yes i love infamous so much
This made me want to see a battle between Aya Brea from Parasite Eve against... somebody. 😂
I need Gandalf vs Dumbledore
Wft is Megatron gonna do to frieza
4:07 Wait, Little Big Planet?! WTF?!
Ten years…….I owe my friend ten bucks.
Mr fantastic vs plastic man
God of War Kratos VS Darksiders War
The wasp vs bumblebee
As someone who argued for Cole to win back in the 2010-2012 on Comicvine, I'm extremely happy to that Deathbattle got this right. Alex is a nightmare matchup for most opponents, but Cole just happens to have a counter for just about anything Alex could throw at him. Not to mention his attacks just have a higher power and potency to them
Brainiac vs Ultron
Muffin button lol
"We haven't emptied our trash since 2013?". That would explain where they got the outcome of Discord vs Bill Cipher.
Two characters that look into the abyss but when the abyss look back, one of them blink.
So i guess we are just going to ignore he could have just touched cole and he would have won?  Nom nom the battery boi  Oh well more death battle logic of popularity > Facts
The badground music matched so perfectly with these Era of gaming
Infamous 1 and 2 were amazing, second son is better forgotten though lol
How the hell have we not seen a DB for sentient planets? Like Ego vs Mogo Or Unicron vs Galactus?
I feel like as soon as a character is introduced with some kind of "energy stealing/conversion" ability the match is already over. They almost always win with it. You can't fight something that just takes your power and uses it against you because then it's just Dude vs God
Great episode. Can we please get Escanor vs Gerard
As a massive Prototype fan who also loves Infamous I can say that Alex is basically Shin Godzilla and Cole is Legendary Atomic Godzilla when he absorbed Mothra's powers. Given time, Alex can win due to mutations but those come way too slow in a fight against someone who can disintegrate him on an atomic level or absorb his own bioelectricity. Alex literally had no chance the longer the fight dragged on.
Winner:Kiva Andru
Alex is literally a virus what electricity would he absorb exactly, swear y’all bias as hell
Kiva Andru VS Juniper lee (Megas XLR VS The Life And Times Of Juniper Lee)
Kang the conqueror vs frieza👀
I didnt see that ending coming I swear. I always thought Alex Mercer was crazy powerful. Also I miss both Prototype & Infamous ☹️
It would have been better to see a battle between Galvatron vs Freezer
Death Battle Crossover-Cartoon Network City Smackdown (Kiva Andru VS Juniper Lee)
All I got to say is Alex Mercer girlfriend is stupid I know she had to know he be taking on Military guys with machine guns and all different types of artillery manages to kill them and she thought shooting him in the head with a handgun was going to drop him💯🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
SPOILERS FOR NEXT MATCH:      Can Megatron even blow up a planet? Pretty sure Frieza's about to sweep
I didn't grow up in the PS3 era, but I did play the Infamous games on PS Now, so I'm glad Cole pulled off the win.
we need remakes  of thoose games
Would absorbing bio electricity or neuro electricity or whatever allow the consumption of the actual biomass though? Would it not simply be taking the juice out of a battery?
ok wait hold on, i know there's some BUSTED versions of optimus prime, i heard there was even a reality warper tbh version of him, but frieza-?? frieza vs megatron? i'm so utterly baffled i'm not sure how strong megatron is let alone all his versions, but there's a black version of frieza that just one shotted ultra ego and ultra instinct i'm sure- so what's gonna happen here?
I’ve been waiting for this moment…for all my life…oh lord
Draining people was bad Cole move but they pitted good Cole so I don't know if it was a legit win
Frieza vs mega— is that even a debate? 😂😂
aint no way this got darkseid and thanos budget
Heroes never die
How will megatron beat Black Frieza when Black Frieza literally one shot a warrior that was literally granted the ability to be the strongest in the Universe. Which should include the warrior Gogeta since Frieza specifically trained to be able to combat him or Jiren after seeing how outclasses he was.
the classic argument from 2009 come alive "which one should i play"
I feel like a Linkin Park song would be very appropriate for the fight
Why the hell would anyone ask for Frieza vs Megatron?
Cmon now, Alex didn’t really stand a chance. Not against Cole of all people.
I think i was the only one who thought alex was gonna win
This was the matchup I was waiting for! I can die happy now
Always the more popular heroes win 😅
Which megatron? Because some comic megatrons scale to an Omniverse tier unicron. Others dont even scale to base optimus.
Hi I was wondering if you could do a video where the bad time trio fight another trio because hav enough ever done a tag team battle three v three or an undertale one yet?
Whelp.. megatron is gonna get scrapped in the next fight( if they don’t use the idw comics variants for megatron), they used Ultra Ego Vegeta for when he went against Thor so we all know Black Frieza is gonna make an appearance. Who was able to one shot both ultra instinct goku and ultra ego Vegeta the second he revealed this power and we know how crazy they are. Fingers crossed they got Littlekuriboh to play frieza tho cause he’s awesome.
Oh YEAH!!!!! COLE WINS FLAWLESS VICTORY  FATALITY!!! Lightning beats Biomass!!!  And did a hear a rematch with Evil Cole?
Loved the fight, glad they didn't use evil cole, the fight would've been 6 seconds. Also the music for both games at all times perfect choice
Who decided Megatron and frieza for the next match and why?
A a lover of both of these games this was amazing! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
frieza vs megatron i know both are very powerful but thats about it
2:53 - Personal pet peeve, but it bugs me.  Bullets don't fly with the shell casing still attatched.  That part is left behind.  Only the slug at the front of the bullet actually flies off.
This Death Battle was awesome, and next Death Battle is gonna be between Frieza and Megatron!😄🤩😎👌 Looking forward to it!
2:23 learn of einstein's most famous equation: E = mc^2 4:41 so that's how fast electricity is
Frieza vs Megatron? I don't think Megatron can stand up to Golden Frieza... let alone Black Frieza..
how would edward elric vs rudius greyrat go?
WHOEVER THE HELL MADE THIS BATTLE?! I AM FOLLOWING YOU NOW. Jesus this fight was AMAZING for these two. I loved every effin second of it dude!
Back when open world superhero-type games were actually good and had no microtransactions. Good times.

Comment n. 7 ZARAKI KENPACHI VS RORONOA ZORO!! please 🙏
I really love how they showed off how agile Cole is since in a lot of his fights hes on the defensive before his opening arises.
COLE FOR THE WIN I LOVE INFAMOUS!!!!!!!!!!!
You should do Seek from Doors vs Venom.
Finally. This is the matchup I’ve always wanted and been thinking of since middle school (year 2010). After a decade, I’ve finally got my answer 😂😂😂😊
God damn it Alex. You should have eaten a few electric eels.
I've played both of these games and I have to say I was surprised to see how this turned out.  I thought that Alex's edge of close range, enhanced mobility, and regeneration would do Cole in.  Cole can heal himself but only by draining an electrical source. He could regenerate with the help of a storm, but that's more situational than overall. The Polarity Shield can give Cole more energy from blocking projectiles, but I don't remember if it could heal him at the same time. Cole's mobility is only enhanced through electrical items like wires, and the Static Thrusters don't really give him much more than gliding while Alex had enhanced running speed, can jump to incredible heights, wall run and glide by expelling biomass from his body. Cole can move with the Lightning Tether, but that requires time to aim while Alex doesn't need that requirement.  Not to mention the weaknesses. Alex has only displayed weakness twice: being injected with an antibody that hindered his powers and Bloodtox, a chemical that acts as a poison to him. But these are all genetically engineered to kill the Blacklight virus, therefore it's not readily available.  While Cole has a weakness to water. Although he can stand in puddles harmless enough, if he gets soaked by a large amount of it, it can kill him. And in an urban setting with water towers and fire hydrants, Alex can hold an advantage over Cole if he can exploit that weakness.  But I forgot about the scale of the Ray Sphere's power along with The Beast's. Even The Beast mentioned regenerating itself atom by atom, if that's any indication.
I'm down to see Unicron (Transformers) vs Galactus (Marvel) BATTLE OF THE PLANET EATERS!
15:10 has to be my favorite part of this entire fight
Freeza vs. Megatron seems like a mismatch unless you use Alternity Megatron, but at the same time that feels unfair to Freeza with how busted Alternity's abilities are...
Oh this fight about to be fuuuucccckkkkeeddddd
This Was Fantastic!  Just Like Bill Vs Discord, I Love Both Characters, So It Would've Been A Tie For Me Either Way, I Really Enjoyed This Awesome Episode!
I AM SO HYPED!!! I LOVE THESE STORIES AND THESE CHARACTERS!!! ❤
Oooh do delving Rowe vs the guy from heroes that could copy powers
"well that just happened".......man did you guys right Star Wars and Forespoken?????
Voldemort vs Orochimaru, you cowards, lol
Wanna say, as a fan of both franchises This was so beautiful; years of the theoretical finally being proven!
As soon as Alex started talking like a villain I knew Cole was going to win
I was always Mercer over Cole. I still am…. Wish the outcome was different.
My inner teenager has been pleased
18:20 here we go! I was hoping they would do this fight!
Huh. To me I thought if Cole won it would be because Alex couldn't refill his power fast enough. I thought Alex came off as overall far more powerful and durable but because he needs to keep consuming victims to remain in the game, his linchpin would be running out of energy.
I loved both of these games and - to be honest - I was hoping for Cole to win, but I thought for sure that Mercer had this battle in the bag. Glad to see I was wrong.
Cool
Prototype 2 was better
So if it's Unicron trilogy Megatron then there might be a fight, other wise most Megatron's are only building to city level with IDW's Autobot Megatron having black hole/ antimatter powers for a time.
NARUTO VS GOKU
I'm sensing some prejudice here...
Megatron vs Frieza idk  I’d to see megatron fight some other robot!
Popeye vs bugs bunny
I think the evil boom stick would be the non alcoholic one
I can't wait to see Frieza get killed by a jet
I betted the wrong person just because I play his game first … THAT WAS AWESOME STILL~
You guys should do Rorschach versus the The Question! Would be an amazing fight right thier!
I don't like this fight. As a fan of InFamous i can tell that cole didn't use the half of the power he have in InFamous 1 ans 2. I am disapointed
If I could choose the abilities of any fictional character in the world it would be Mercers
Vampire Cole McGrath
I wish Alex won great video though
I honestly did not expect Cole to win. But I'm glad he did.
I'm so sad that Alex Mercer, that edgy hero I grew up lose... I'm so sad.
Frieza vs Megatron? How is that even a fight? Megatron is gonna get crushed
Another wonky death battle, there is no world in which cole stands a chance against alex, he literally has no way to kill him lol. Nice fight but incorrect outcome.
Two characters from games that I really want to play but haven’t for some reason
My suggestion for an ep is Mewtwo VS any psychic hero/villain character. Maybe like Jean or Emma frost from x men
:) PLEASE do DC's GODLIKE SUPERMAN vs the INSANE, DEVIL that is Marvel's THE SENTRY!
You guys got very obvious with outcomes. Sadly. Generally speaking, whoever transforms first, loses.
As soon as I heard one guy could absorbed the other guys power  Ya it's over...
...About time this finally happened.  Still, I have to admit, I'm surprised at the winner.  I thought, 100%, that the other would win.  Pretty neat.
Glass cannon vs the undying cockroach
This is a cool fight but now you need to do the follow ups aka Delsin Rowe the dude with 4+ conduit powers and James Heller the dude who canonically beats Alex Mercer
NGL i think that like alex would have had to merge with like the whole human race for this to be a draw cause we know cole can do a planet wide burst capable of killing off a gene not having to waste so much energy on distance would prob let him fry even a whole human race absorbed alex at the cost of his own life
THIS IS A LONG TIME COMING!   I remember fans pitting these two super-powered beings against each other on a daily basis when their respective games were released. Some of my fondest memories in gaming to this day.   Thank you guys for seeing this through after all these years❤
That 7gs is grossly over estimated. You have to take in the energy it would take to convert material into energy
The Punisher vs John Wick
YES
I kinda hope they have a character from the destiny franchise in one of theese eventually and then get supper disapointed when they super nerf what ever character they choos
Undercover brother vs tiger Jackson
alex can go at light speed
Now we gotta do the sequel Protagonists
I love this channel!
Man the 2000s really had some cool IPs
They are both pretty unimpressive.
Atoms > molecules  The smallest things really do matter.
Wack.. Cole literally lost nearly every second of that fight just to win at the last second.
Mr. Fantastic versus Plastic man!!! I need it damn!!
What about Cole's fire powers?
2 of my favorite games of all times
This is my first time learning about Alex Mercer. But damn it sounds like he should fight Albert Wesker from Resident Evil after watching his preview
Who and who?
They should do Armored Core vs Transformers
i don't remember Alex having a full body armor also don't remember Coles tornado attack to be able to affect cars
For not wanting to do this battle, that was a freaking sick fight. On paper I thought Cole didn't have a chance, even though I preferred infamous back in the day. Happy to see this result.
This is the most early 2000s teen thing i have seen in a long while
Yall remember when Cole was a vampire
Nail biting edge of my seat episode, awesome 👌
Deku (bnha) vs aang (avatar)
Man I legit though Cole was done for because Alex could just consume him and then it hit me, Cole can absorb his bioelectricity! I for real thought that Cole would need to summon a thunderstorm so powerful it could burn Alex at a molecular level but to see him pull an UNO reverse? Death Battle you sly fox, 9 years and you nailed it.
Amazing 👌🏼🔥 exactly as I expected
That was totally awesome❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Shadow are you watching this?
Day 1 of asking for Minecraft Steve vs somebody
Yo freiza vs megatron now that’s dope
I've waited years for this match up.
They really underplayed how overpowered that E=mC^2 part is. As a consideration, the mass of like 2 or 3 squares of toilet paper would be roughly equivalent to the energy of a nuclear explosion. If Cole can rapid-fire convert full on HELLICOPTER CHAIN BULLETS into pure energy like that, then his effective output would be downright unbelievable.
Out of respect for your amazing videos, I sit through each and every food and binder adds in your videos......this is the greatest respect I can give
I knew neither of these guys, but neat battle. I just hope my gun tyrant can win against an alien tyramt
“Read your mind like goku’s muffin button” thank you for that reference death battle
I really enjoyed this one it’s about time lol. It’s the next match up that I’m confused about Megatron can be hurt by rpgs and stuff like that but Frieza is eating that stuff. So how is this a good match up? Note my knowledge on transformers is limited.
Toxin (marvel) vs james heller
12 year old me was dreaming of this day
10 years for this death battle. 10 WHOLE YEARS. WORTH IIIIIT
Damn this was dope.. I want another infamous game with cole being back
Hey you there, YouTube commenter. What year is this?
Great. Guess whose downloading prototype 1 and 2 now.
Megatron is losing frieza is going to stomp that robot
Awesome Shocking Video.
All hail Megatron
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S OUT, LEXY. OUT OF YOUR MIND!
Time huh? Thanks for the tip
This was definitely Infamous
VAMPIRE HUNTER D WHEN
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! HE WON! 🎉 🎆 PLAYSTATION ALL STARS 2 WHEN?! Also, how is Megatron going to beat Frieza who is basically Universal?
Honestly I’m surprised we don’t have a team death battle, where a character and their inverse sidekick or whatever fight against another character and their sidekick
I feel like frieza is going to lose solely because we have zero idea on how strong black frieza is and let’s be honest. Dragon ball has such a terrible track record
Hey, where did that “Awesome Sauce” part come from?
I’m so f$&king happy this debate is over lol I’ll be honest I thought Alex would win but cole is my favorite
With as many times as you guys saying Shadow the hedgehog in this, is making me hope he's gonna be in a future battle soon
Meh.
Alucard (Castlevania) vs Vampire hunter D.
Their clothes are SO durable
Hmmm… I don’t have any attachment to either, so I can look at this completely unbiased.  Electrofucker should have lost. You’re telling me that Fleshydouche couldn’t have eaten Electrofucker any faster? Or that during any point in the fight some piece of his matter escaped and could regenerate and live to fight another day? Remember, Fleshydouche can think at like 5 nanoseconds or whatever the hell the calculation was, and he’s got the memories and experiences of thousands of people, including probably geniuses, so I am sure he would have saw a weakness of some sort in Electrofucker or knew better than to let himself get completely destroyed.
I think Alex would of won
Eso estuvo EPICO!!!!
Now we can’t see Spy from Tf2 VS. Agent 47 of the hitman Series
Knowing what is known about Megs and Frieza, Megatron doesn't stand a scraplet's chance in a smelter!
If Alex Mercer and James Heller switched roles on Prototype 2 and Alex consumed James at the end, and if Pariah was the final boss of Prototype 3 and Alex consumed him too, Alex would've totally aced this fight.
unicron vs galactus
Finally after all these years it happened
It's difficult to make a grim-mature character without going edgy.  For every Lelouch vi Britainnia or Kain, there are a dozen Alex Mercers.
so worth the wait
Holy s**t! That f**kin rocked!!!
Freeza VS Megatron💀💀💀Megatron is gonna get bodied😭
"Read your mind like Goku's muffin button." ROFL nicely done DB
Clementine (The Walking Dead) for DEATH BATTLE!  Connections opponent must have:  - Lost her family during the zombie apocalypse - Was raised by a middle-aged surrogate father who mentored her in survivability - Eventually became an experienced survivor - Was later tasked to protect babies that isn't hers who she became a parental figure to - Survived various encounters with zombies, bandits, cannibals, and even dogs - Was eventually bitten by a zombie - Went through a gruesome event that caused her to lose a specific body part  I suggested Ellie (The Last of Us) on the OFFICIAL SUGGESTION FORM.
Yooooo rip megatro  dude has no shot against frieza
Awesome Sauce
I was rooting for Mercer but expected Macgrath to win.
Im so happy my boy got the dub
Was thinking during this video, that both Cole and Alex have insane regenerative abilities, leading to more than likely a battle of attrition that would make the winner unclear. Cole can heal off almost anything with enough electricity, and Alex regenerated from a puddle by feeding off biomass. It’s more interesting to contemplate what would run out first. Electricity, or bystanders?
Calling it: Cole just got E=MC2 ed for MATTER CONVERSION. Think that means he wins, even before the time travel (!) gets brought in.  Edit* YES~!
So this frieza vs megatron thing. it's a joke right? If they go up to the current chapters of super black frieza is way beyond anything megatron could deal with.
18:29 this will be very interesting, Yesss
Next week is... well I would say Slaughter but I don't think that is accurate. Total Obliteration with a maniacal laugh at the end.
After nearly a decade, they finally deliver… thank you death battle
Havent emptied  out trash in 10 years?... i dont know why but this had me laughing.
this battle was the representation of man vs virus
Cole vs Black Lighting
Goku's Muffin Button...reference of the episode!
Awesome 💯
Gosh damn that battle was so awesome 🤩🤩🤩🤩❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍
I’ve been waiting years for this but using second son would of been better
One of the biggest showdowns us fans have asked for in Death Battle for a while, and it did not disappoint!
Real quick, what do ya'll think of Frieza vs Megatron? Who wins and why?
A crossover game would be godly
Back when the world was sane
Im so confused how does Cole surviving the ray sphere incident and the beast make him immune to DNA modifying diseases
This was a sweet bday present to me
So this clearly 2!Alex personality-wise, because first game Alex would just want to be left alone.
Bro I was so scared for Cole I’m so glad he won (Also let’s be real I think all transformer characters would absolutely die Ngl so maybe Frieza wins) Cole rooters⬇️
Finally the smart one and the dumbass redneck finally made an episode about two of my favorite games
FROZONE VS ICEMAN
Cole’s Muffin Button powers are a huge bonus.
Alex wasn't really a villain, until the second game I guess.  Also had the hardest achievement ever.  Try to play the game without killing a civilian...
Everyone did say that Cole would win and even though I knew he would win it was still a fun fight to watch
Do Plastic Man vs Elasti-girl (DC vs The Incredibles)
Monkey hater vs metal monarch? Gonna be crazy 🤘
13:40 Alex Mercer Jumpscare
wait, in protype you turn out to be playing the villain and in the end you just lose and die? thats different.
Frieza vs Megatron??? Wtf
Brandon Yates predicted next episode!
I was hella rooting for Alex in this one but I'm just glad to see a fight like this animated this well.  Amazing battle, amazing choreography. Definitely one of my favorites for a long time
Well, now I gotta go play through Infamous 2 again.... Oh no...
Doesn’t matter who wins these are 2 bad*** mother*******
whoever said frieza vs Megatron was a good fight needs mental help
I want to see saitama vs superman
Travis Touchdown vs Jack from MadWorld
did anyone else ABSOLUTELY lose it when he said "And he can read your mind like Goku's muffin button", or just me?
Mercer should fight Carnage at some point. Shapeshifters with broken healing factors and a red motif; it's a no brainer.
Pls make a Godzilla battle royal
Hell yeah  I thought alex would win but I am happy i was proven wrong
Man, forget Cole should have been vampire Cole.
Plesee do Kingshark vs Bane
A little equation called "E=MC Hammered"
Yeah, my boy Cole won
Can we get a death battle between Meruem and Perfect Cell? Seriously, that one is just BEGGING to happen.
That 2000s music just made the edgy grunge style so much better, perfect fit
Very good animation, even if the result makes no sense.
This is the first db in years that fully threw me through a loop
So I see there are still no plans for a Skeletor vs. Mumraw Deathbattle. I am just going to be silly and request ar this point Herbert Farnsworth from Futurama vs. John Herbert a.k.a Herbert the Pervert from  Family Guy in a Deathbattle.
Alex should've definitely taken the win.
Now I’m hoping Infamous and Prototype get remakes someday.
We ain’t forget about Ben 10 vs green lantern
8/10 music detracted from the fight
YEAH! I knew Cole would win.
I was pretty surprised by the outcome of this one. Having played all of the games in these 2 franchises, I felt way more powerful playing as the loser of this match in his games. But, I quite enjoyed this match-up and the outcome.
Cole  and his story seem a lot like Static Shock.
First starscream then Optimus and now megatron
Mercer fans in shamble rn🚬🚬🤣🤡 COLE OBLITERATES 💯🥱💪🏾💪🏾
I loved them both not mad at the result ❤
This was the most 2012 video ever... and I loved it.
I really miss this era of gaming.  The era of full, complete, badass and fun games with no microtransactions 😢
It's crazy that this video game rivalry goes back as far as *_15 WHOLE YEARS AGO_*
Lowkey this is basically budget Magneto vs Carnage
HELLO FRESH VS SHADYRAYS DEATH BATTLE
The key to predicting the winner of these battles is whoever has the "X Factor":For instance, Cole's stronger than Alex, therefore he'd eventually overpower and kill the BlackLight Virus. And to whoever may think Megatron's beating Frieza, go watch Dragon Ball Z, then come back.
Let us thank the intern that threw this script into Boomstick's bin Boomstick never taking out the bin is why we got to watch this
Frezza is gonna turn megatron into his new throne
A part of me wishes these games got another entry but a different part of me is a bit worried of how well that would go. After seeing what happened to Saints Row and Crackdown, I think the pure edge of these games would be a nightmare for any company to try and adapt in the modern age.
Love the music. Think it's same dudes from miles and static.
Gru VS Megamind Back To Week Of September 26th Now For Tuesday
The Doctor vs the 05 Council during SCP-5000.
Shanks vs anyone 😆
Fun fact:  a cell can exist without genetic material but not without bioelectricity
Haha finally
Half as long, twice as bright. Thank you for this guys <3
We gotta get Delsin Rowe vs James Heller next
Guys guys hear me out Princess Bubblegum vs Bulma
I don't think anyone even knows those two games
For those who waited and wanted, hope it was worth the wait.
Can y’all redo Naruto vs ichigo
What about fire god liu kang vs kratos
Frieza vs. Megatron?   Where's that 'are you serious' Jameson meme when I need it?
I've been requesting this battle since i was in middle school. Im so glad this was finally animated. I was more hyped for this than superman vs goku.
Ya I can agree with this outcome
Dustin row don't know who he versus but you should do a Dustin row db
You know the script is old when broomstick talks about his ex-wife
What about fire god liu kang vs kratos
I don't agree with the winner (although I prefer Cole to Alex) but the video was great, it was worth waiting so many years.
Ytf is frieza fighting megatron!!... no way is this fight gonna be close or even entertaining!!🤦🏾🤦🏾🤦🏾
18:29 The battle of the tyrunt rulers And it's close on my birthday Frieza hands down
Ok it’s a no brainer frieza going to win he’s fighting a machine a space one
Wiz emptied the trash right after this episode didn't he?
Mr_whoever_animated_the_fight: close-ups isn't the only way to frame action. Every. Single. Frame characters take 80% of the screen space - I couldn't see anything, only kinda vaguely guess what's going on.
I feel like Alex is cooler, and so I knew he was dead when I saw him in here since him winning would feel pleasant.
Ngl though. It has been 13 years since both of these games came out before death battle existed, but this was the biggest and most voted matchup ever
You guys should do a death battle having Bryan Mills(Taken) vs Robert McCall(Equalizer)
so who thinks frieza is going to stomp next death battle?
What an episode
I was kind of hoping for Asura vs Kratos!
For the love of God, someone please at least make remakes for these games can you imagine how insane that would be🤯
Mercer stomps no diff, bro tanked a nuke and regenerated like it was nothing
NO NO NO NOT THAT NEXT TIME NO
Mercer: Fine then. I'll  just absorb you "  Cole: "You read my mind" 😈😈😈
MUFFIN BUTTON!
"Well that just happened"  "He's standing right behind me isn't he?"  Oh no. Death Battle not you too!
this video is about 10 years late 😂😂
Frieza vs megatron My dream has come true
Spoiler Cole helped create the Beast.
"The Walking Dead" Rick/Carl vs. "The Last of Us" Joel/Ellie.
Jack of Blades Mario & Luigi vs Sonic and Tails
Peopel saying frieza vs Megatron aint fair, there aint no way death battle would make an unfair death battle, unless it had goofy characters in it
I love how early 2010s this episode is
Luffy vs plastic man!
Next episode is a curbstomp, if anyone has any info that Megatron could beat Frieza, share away
I would love a remark of these games, I loved both when they came out and played the hell out of them.
Why on earth would you pit a dragonball character against a transformers character... Are you drunk?
Not going to lie I thought Alex had this
What?!
Evil Cole would’ve swept that man
Do With Stewie Griffin VS Dexter Of Death Battle
I Thought Alex will actually win
Prototype deserves its own second son, but I think infamous kind of ran its course. Newer games would have trouble creating an interesting narrative in the same world, only really the new elements would make it interesting. I guess you could reboot the franchise but that would require an insane amount of care.
While I agree that Evil Cole would beat Alex, I don't think Good Cole could beat Alex, Cole only beat the Beast because of the RFI, something specifically designed to target the energy that makes up the Beast. When that blade stabbed into Cole, that would've killed him.
This felt like an early 2000s movie, and I mean that in the most positive way possible.
One of 2008's biggest gaming arguments, finally settled after 15 years. I love both inFAMOUS and [PROTOTYPE] for different reasons, so I would've been happy either way no matter who won, but I'm not gonna lie, Cole taking the win kinda put a smile on my face. This was a really good one.
So basically these two characters were " you die a hero or live long enough to become a villain"
God I really regret getting rid of the first two infamous game I mean I own Second Son but still
"GOKUS MUFFIN BUTTON"
Dude I wish they make someday Serious Sam Vs Duke Nukem
13:17 FIGHT!!!!
Nice rumb
Can we get a transformer bs Transformer and can they be scourge vs lockdown
Oh..Frieza vs Megatron? You just take a quess on who's winning that one ppl.
Freiza vs Megatron? What? What do they have in common?
Spawn vs Jackie Estacado from The Darkness
2:13 whiz know Dragon Ball Z Abridged cool😂😂
This was one of those battles that I didn't care about who won. played both first games to the end, and it was really entertaining! 👏
What is the hassle to bring in Lupin the Third into Death Battle!?
this is a fight that i wanted to see forever ago. Pretty sure I suggested it a decade ago rofl.
Funny, I thought Infamous Second Son made evil Cole from 2 the canon ending
Shadow VS Luigi Optimus Prime VS Leonardo Izuku Midoriya VS Goku Squidward VS Eric Cartman
Still looking for Lucoa vs beerus or Godzilla or something. Hopefully she shows up one battle and fights.
Black Suit.
Big O vs Megazord
😊😊😊😊😊
Wtf frieza one hits transformers verse
Cole vs Magento is something I want to see now.
Alma Wade vs Allessa Gilespie!!!!!!!
Oh  💩! FINALLY!!!! I've asked for this for YEARS 🥹
This is one of the Death Battles I always dreamed of.
# lord of arcana vs devil May cry
Alex looks like a Carnage from Venom
Wait, you mean this was something in the works ten years ago?  ...Well damn, maybe there IS a chance then...  In that case, I've been waiting to see a few happen, myself:  Deunan Knute (Appleseed) vs Motoko Kusanagi (Ghost in the Shell) Briarios Hecatonchires (Appleseed) vs Nemesis (Resident Evil) Sterling Archer (ARCHER) vs James Bond
I disagree, can’t see any way cole will survive Alex.
Oh come on! You didn’t mention the Pinup Contest!
Do Steve vs terrarium character
Even back in the day, I really wanted these two games to collaborate. This fight was absolutely amazing!
Im going in blind on this one so I'm hoping for the unexpected!
Freddy Kruger vs. Agent Smith
So, what I'm taking from this is that Cole MacGrath is basically Static(Virgil Hawkins), if he was white and powered by edgy. He even has an ultra powerful future self.
That was awesome.
LORD FRIEZA VS MEGATRON IS CRAZY!!! ALL HAIL LORD MEGATRON!!!
Anyone know why it took them so long to finally do this Mu? I would say budget and better mus is one of the reasons.
I wonder why it took so long for this fight to happen. It's a shame that neither franchise is supported anymore, because they were some of the most fun games released in 2009. I was a reviewer back then, and I spent more time playing inFamous than any other game that summer.
I remember that Infamous was one of the games that sony gave out for free after their network got hacked.
Infamous was literally the 1st video game I ever played as a child Seeing this And seeing the respect core Deserves brings a tear to my eye
This was a Death Battle Match up I asked for YEARS ago, Like season 1 I believe. Thanks for finally doing it!
(Death Battle Idea)  Adam Smasher (Cyberpunk 2077) Vs Frank Horrigan (Fallout2)  !The Battle Of Future Combatants! !Ruthless And Most Feared! !Both Main Bosses That Can't Be Reasoned With !PLS DEAR GOD!  Edit; After Phantom Liberty Sets In Then That Would Be The Best Time To Capitalize On Adam Smasher And Frank Horrigan's First Time On Death Battle, It Would Be Perfect.
Darksiders vs Dark Souls Asura vs Hulk Yukari Yakumo vs Madoka Kaname Slayer vs Demitri Maximoff Maki Harukawa vs Revy or Roberta Tatsuya Shiba vs Izuru Kamukura Ryo vs Ryu
I really hope they make doomsday vs SCP 682
"Read your mind like goku's muffin button" THEY DID THE THING!!!
I'm not really a sony fan but I am glad we finally got another PlayStation character. I got to talk with a friend of mine about this matchup because he told me how this was one of his most wanted matchups and he told me a lot about both characters which made me really interested to see how this fight ends up being, and after hearing him talk about both characters I expected Alex to win even tho I wanted Cole to win. Also I am glad we are getting another Transformers and another DBZ character.
FIRST OFF SCREEW THE SCRIPT MERCER IS SUPPOSED TO LITERALLY BEAT THAT ELECTRIC DO GOODER THIS IS SO BULL SH*** YOUR SCRIPT WHITER ARE BENDING US AND F****cking THE BEST DEATH BATTLE GOOOOOOD
...yeah mercy is going to slaughter cole. The minute i heard cole had an atomic core in his body, it told me mercer was more durable
EXCUISE ME MEGATRON VS FRIEZA???????????????????????????
i can name at least 5 ways alex could easily win but the animation is good for what ist worth
The perfect Matchup of Energy Vs Biology. The 2000's were freaking wild man!
finally a death battle i can get behind
Wait. Furiza vs. Megatron? Furiza destroyed a planet and nrarly an entire warrior race with a single ki attack while in his weakest on-screen form and before he ever really took training seriously.
So Frieza is easily winning right?
No! My beloved shapeshifter!  In all seriousness, this was a fun battle to watch. Really want to see one with Sgt. James Heller, who should technically be stronger than Alex, since he consumes him at the end of the second Prototype game
So freaza vs a metal robot?
Let's go megatron
Yo, Lord Frieza vs Lord Megatron is gonna be sick, and as much as i love Megs, i think Frieza has got this one
I mean, doing this fight now is as good as it'll ever be, so i think leaving the crypt script in the trash for a while was a good idea. It made what would have been a pretty cringe episode into an actually decent one.
Rip Megatron
James Heller actually blames Alex for the death of his wife and daughter.
Wasn't really sure who was going to win this fight. Regarding the next matchup, Frieza has a LOT more going for him than Megatron, what with the whole "multiple planets destroyed" thing.
Let's hope that this episode brings interest back to at least one of these franchises...    Also Frieza vs. Megatron let's go!!!
Where is Frieza v Megatron fair? It’s just bullying a robot
TEN YEARS IN THE MAKING!!! Love this one, sad they didn’t bring up the bikini contest, overall though one of my favorites.
cant wait to see how a Megatron vs frieza fight is remotely competitive
ugh finally, another dbz characther
alien vs predator?
This first time I didn’t guess it right🤯🤯🤯
Anyone else wanna read that old script to see what it was about?
Please make Sin (FFX) vs Vegnagun (FFX2) happen. It will be epic!
Still wait fatalis vs grigori
This is how electric Spider-Man was born
Alex is yet another victim of giving the opponent ideas
Welp, I said it before, I'm frankly offended Cole walked away from this.
I really don't need to watch it. (I'm going to) but Alex would destroy Cole terribly.
I've been waiting for this Death Battle for so long, and I'm so happy to see both of my favorite protagonists fight finally ⚡️⚡️
Frieza Vs Megatron?  Where is the fight?  With that being said, they're going to find a way for Megatron to win......
Out of these two I thought col would lose I'm so happy he won
I agree with the verdict however, I do not agree with the logic.
The weird thing is I was just rewatching a playthrough of prototype like 2 weeks ago
Spoiler: It feels like Alex should've won because dude is designed to kill mfs, like just look at him. BUT DAMN Cole was actually broken as hell.
I really don't see the logic of Cole winning here, Mercer has him beat in every category, speed, power, durability, intelligence. The only thing Cole can counter is Alex's disguises which wouldn't really matter anyway.
Probably the most natural conflict in a Death Battle
I would like to see a scarecrow vs Freddy Krueger death battle for halloween. I think that would be awesome whos with me and please be nice ok.
Either I did this before this was cool, or someone has done this way back when...I thought it was you guys. Oh well, let's see it again!
Frieza vs Megatron  Racist vs Dictator lol
Ah, so the next DB is going to be an execution? Because there's no way in hell Megatron can beat Frieza...
Got a contender idea... The MC from "The Surge 2", in a Exo-Suit vs Exo-Suit match?
I think Eminem is gonna sue somebody
Lawl. I don't buy this one for a second 😂😂
To think that Cole McGrath had beaten Alex Mercer... it's a travesty, but in a way, it also makes sense. Alex had the knowledge and the resistance, as well as the training... but Cole was significantly more powerful considering that he killed a being known as The Beast. As a person who's not really played Infamous, I don't have the scope of what power The Beast has, but DEATH BATTLE has it described as a being of unimaginable Power... and if Cole could actually absorb The Beast's power, Alex would stand less of a chance. Yes, Alex has taken on some of the most powerful Blacklight creatures, but it's nothing compared to what Cole has fought against and won...
Not to mention the fact that Infamous is a far superior game.
SPOILERS:      No way. NO WAY! We’re actually getting Frieza vs Megatron as the next matchup? Nice! I wonder if LittleKuriboh knows about this?  P.S. Was this episode’s script really written ten years ago? And if so, why wait until now?
YES! Frieza vs Megatron, another fight I've always wanted to happen!
I feel like Frieza is way too strong for Megatron Especially current Frieza
heres an idea......tarzan from dark horse vs turok from turok dinosaur hunter
Did people seriously vote for Frieza vs Megatron? C'mon, like Frieza isn't gonna absolutely wreck his metal ass. He's literally gonna dismantle the guy and make a new throne from his parts
Alex reminded me of venom fighting.
I like how the outcome made sense scientifically as well. In a battle between someone who can control electricity and someone who could control biomass, the one who can control electricity will always win. Even excluding the nervous system, organic matter is mainly reliant on bioelectricity to determine shape. How would a baby in the womb know to have 4 limbs and a head in that specific fashion? Biological matter, including viruses like the Blacklight, use bioelectric signaling all the time to determine their shape and structure. Cole’s ability to both manipulate and straight-up steal that electricity from Alex almost completely negates his physical form entirely, making this matchup doomed from the start.
Well.....that was unexpected lol
Shadow: Wow! What a rip-off!
I have been wanting for this fight for years. I'm so happy  Edit: saw the video, my money was on the winner, I'm happy
I still want a rematch between DOOM Slayer and Master Chief.
Awesome!
Given that Alex could absorb some of Cole's DNA through the wounds he caused, giving Alex Conduit powers, I find it strange that they wouldn't in some way equalize stats, similar to the Rogue vs Wonder Woman fight from a long time ago. Plus, Cole absorbing bio-electricity is not the same as Alex's consumption of DNA, so Cole couldn't "do the same thing to Alex" as described.  I also don't see the logic that Cole could resist infection because he could withstand his atoms being broken down by the Ray Sphere detonation. Infection rearranges the genes, and therefore molecules, and the Conduit gene, as described, is a gene, which is made out of molecules, so that aspect of Cole that gives him his powers is genetic, not atomic. Plus, does molecular DNA survive nukes? No, but because these are fictional characters, we let those rules slide.  Also notice that in the results, it says Cole is "Vulnerable to possible corruption" yet they explain that away right before, so why is that point even there? That point alone suggests Cole could be infected. If he could be corrupted by multiple other sources, then the Blacklight Virus should theoretically be able to work on him. Also, Alex has consumed people without "weakening" them, and infection is not the same as consumption, so that's another inaccurate point.  While I find Death Battle scaling to often be inaccurate as to what characters are actually capable of from a narrative standpoint, I can accept by their logic that Cole has better stats. But Alex's infection seems to be the number one deciding factor regardless of stats. I will admit that I am more familiar with Alex as a character, and therefore biased in Alex's favor, I don't think the reasoning shown in the episode is sufficient to give Cole the victory. Also, Bad Karma Cole is not canon, so bringing him up is going outside of canon Cole.
My new favorite death battle
Homer Simpson VS Eric Cartman
Is it bad that I watched the whole video and still have no idea which character is from which game?
Im sure we all know the script was the teue winmer in the end
🤠‼️💜 ALGORITHM APPEASEMENT AND LOVE AND ALGORITHM APPEASEMENT AND LOVE
SPOILERS FOR NEXT TIME       I’m betting on Frieza. But I think Megatron would win
Wait how was Cole faster? Alex can see 66% the speed of light. Even if cole moved faster Alex could easily see him coming
I am sad that no mention of the time the creators of Infamous & Protoype were challenged by Ben Yazee Kroshaw to draw the main character of the apposing game in Lingerie to decide whose game was better
Bro I haven’t played infamous in an extremely long time,I really miss that game.
i really couldint decide who to guess would win... cool episode, lets get shantae the half genie on to death battle! maybe she could fight sanz from understale, or super android marina liteyears from mischief makers.
Finally!!!
Ah man I stopped what I was doing IMMEDIATELY to watch this one. ITS TIME FOR A DEATH BAAAATTLLEEE
Freeza vs megatron. Really? Talk about one sided.
Going into this I was convinced Alex is winning and I say that as more of an Infamous fan but it seems like Cole is way stronger than I thought.   As a person who loved both franchises growing up seeing both of them fight was awesome.   One thing that could have been really cool is if Cole used both good and evil karma powers, he switched between them similar to Anakin in Ahsoka episode 5. I was kinda disappointed it was good Cole nothing against good Cole but evil Cole always had the cooler powerset with stuff like double grenades, trip wire rockets, fire powers, life absorption etc.
The true power of the blacklight virus is its ability to evolve endlessly, if this was a battle between someone less arrogant than alex and they had time to consume other conduits it could easily surpass cole. also alex couldve stolen coles powers as soon as he stabbed him once and absorbed his blood (DNA) he only need to completely consume someone for gameplay reasons and their memories
I wanna see the hunter from the monster hunter series versus someone like aloy from horizon, or the tarnished. How much strength is needed to swing a sword the Size of a person with the force needed to sever a 15 foot thick tail?
Pleasantly happy
This is by far my favourite Death battle match up and the outcome was amazing
Alex Mercer vs Carnege
I honestly wish the next fight could be animated to last exactly 5 minutes....
I genuinely thought Alex had this but the way Cole was represented in this fight made me begin rooting for him.
Aint no way......AINT NOO WAAAY. Look I love you guys but there is a lot of things you didnt mention about Alex Mercer 1. He has super speed (both reaction speed as well as mobility speed on that front he is already faster than Cole) 2. He can infect others to create armys 3. Super strength (Cole is powerful but at Alex's strength he shouldnt even be able to block his hits without having his body crushed) 4.Alex can also summon high level infected enemies(Not only can he create but he can also summon infected as well and pretty strong ones) its called [Hivemind] and {Pack Leader}.  5.Also he Tendril ultimate move is very VERY fast and leaves no gaps meaning that Cole cannot dodge it. 6.Alex's Powers is evolutionary meaning that the longer you fight him, if thats even possible, the more he will adapt to your powers. So technically it is very possible for alex to get even new powers that weren't shown in the game depending on who he fights. 7. Alex is resistant to electricity meaning that Cole is already at a disadvantage when it comes to fighting him. 8.Alex also has increased mass, Mercer is capable of producing shockwaves when landing after leaping from large heights meaning that Cole may need to also have super  strength in order to lift him . 9. Memory Assimilation: Upon consuming an individual, Mercer gains access to all the memories and skills that that individual may have had, allowing Mercer to suddenly master various new skills such as weaponry, vehicle usage, and even military tactics and plans. Meaning that tactically speaking he should be leagues ahead of Cole. 10.Due to his mutation and his natural athletic abilities, Mercer is a master of Parkour, the art of freerunning. Using his enhanced abilities, Mercer is capable of moving around highly condensed areas with the greatest of ease, being able to vault over moving objects, squeeze his way through some of the smallest spaces and transverse up and down various elevations without slowing down. He has been able to use these abilities to escape military pursuit on a number of occasions. His skills in freerunning also increases with the more people he consumes that are skilled with parkour as well. Cole has good air mobility but not at the same level of Alex.
Oh great, frieza vs megatron
After over a decade of waiting it’s finally here
I thought Alex would have won but man I am glad I am wrong as  there was some worries that I had
the fact that not only did my boy Cole win, but it was GOOD Cole, makes me smile. this could have easily been an edgelord vs edgelord fight with evil Cole, instead it was a clash of not only similar games but also conflicting ideologies.
Redo darth Vader vs obito fuckholes
If they hadn't taken out the garbage in 10 years, does that mean they still have all of those dead interns?
ok I'm not an expert on transformers but does Megatron actually stand a chance against friza?
This is a love letter to the Summer of 2009... being a teenager at that time was just awesome. And i can't express my love for these two franchises. Prototype is such a unique and fun experience where you feel like a god. But inFAMOUS will always be one of my favourite games ever. Well done to the DB Crew for what's one of the best Death Battles ever.
When are they gonna do ruby rose
Wow...what did Megatron do to deserve the disrespect he is about receive
i know the transformers prime megatron. but i dont know any of the other versions or how powerful they are. i am also curious if in the next death battle if they are gonna use manga freeza or anime freeza. cus dragon ball characters in the manga are many times stronger than their anime counter parts
Lowkey this felt like when the first games came out. They came out kinda together right?
I really thought that Cole would lose. I'll be damned.
I still remember WAY back in the day when everyone thought the beast Cole would have to kill was Alex Mercer
Frieza vs Megatron?! Damn wasn’t expecting that
You didn't mention that Alex has a move that lets him surf on actual people. He skydive flying kicks them in the chest and proceeds to use them as Skateboard killing them in the process. By far my favorite thing to do in prototype
I miss Cole Mcgrath so much
I still think that Aptom from Guyver would have been a better opponent to Mercer. Sadly, he isn't famous enough to get into the Death Battle.
Bro I want access to the song
Remaster both these games asap bro
what is with these guys and shadow the hedgehog
Next time got me almost as hyped as Billscord!
This is another one of those episodes where I start not knowing either combatant, but end up liking both of them
15:18 this is my favorite part
What else is in your trash bin? Totally asking for a friend who isn't a raccoon
The real unanswered question here is, how many times has Boomstick remarried?
The Fight I have been waiting this whole time! and I'm so glad in seeing this fight. I knew cole would win at the start!
Yo Alex Vs Venom
Fantastic fight! I did play inFamous second son & I knew Cole is powerful
This fight had me on the edge of my seat! Everything about this fight screams high-stakes "Hero vs. Villain" and I'm here for all of it!  *SPOILER: DON'T READ UNLESS YOU'VE WATCHED THE FIGHT!!!* . . . . . . . . . . I seriously thought Cole was gonna lose because of Alex's insane raw power and durability, but as soon as Cole said, "Good idea," I knew it was over for Alex. Cole McGrath for the win! ⚡⚡⚡
Geralt of Rivia vs Drizzt Do'Urden
FINALLY
Peter Parker or Toby McGuire?
Pour one out for Megatron lads
Yo, Megatron in the next episode - was wondering if Transformers would show up again at some point. Granted he's going up against an anime character and we know bonkers in power they can get.
Bruh, was not expecting the ending but it was AWESOME
I was half expecting Evil Boomstick and Blacklight Wiz to do the ending
How does the Next Death Battle make even a lick of sense?!
Megatron is dead.
Me when I saw it was black frieza versus Megatron 😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😢
It was sooo predictable, the dude can just turn his opponent into energy 😂
Frieza vs megatron? You guys cant be serious lol 😅😂 frieza is gonna mop the floor with megatron. Lol
Satan: Okay Wiz and Boomstick, here's a Death Battle idea that you can try. Try to look at this: Juvia Lockser (Fairy Tail) vs. Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender). No?
I am genuinely surprised it turned out to be such a stomp. However, I am still happy the fight happened, regardless of the outcome. Obvious spoilers below:  Cole's cinematic feats are way stronger than Alex, no question about that. Alex may be more powerful gameplay wise (running up Skyscrapers, while carrying a tank). Cole's overall feats are simply too much. It doesn't help that Prototype 2 really shat the bed on the whole franchise, turning Alex into Stupid Evil Moron, who doesn't care about his sister. While in Prototype 1, the whole game, Alex did his best to protect Dana. Such a waste of a good Anti Hero material.  However, I am surprised that Cole was immune to the infection. I thought it was something like a gene, which Alex could manipulate.   Still, as a Prototype fan, I am happy the fight happened in the first place.
JC Denton vs Adam Jensen
inspector clouseau (steve martin) vs   Frank Drebin  o iglú (hero kids) vs benny bubbles (hero elementary)  Son dos batallas que megustarian ver
Can anyone help me find the 2d fight of this that was made 10 or so years ago?
as a Prototype fan that doesn't know much about Infamous, I'm okay with Alex losing, I'm just glad that both franchises and characters are remembered
How in the name of God and Devil is Megatron supposed to beat or even stand up to Frieza?
When it comes to Death Battles i find that the scales of power of each contestant's lore opponents are the most indicitive of who will win. Mercer had some tough fights for sure but Cole's definitly exceeded Mercer's.
Frieza vs Megatron?!   Da hell?! 😂😂😂😂😂  Leaning Frieza, though Megatron won’t go down easy
Megatron stands no chance yall just bullying him for that fight
NOT PIXELS!!!!! FINALLY!!
What happened to the death battles we actually want to see... idek these characters...
I feel like the only things that were good at this episode was the music and the ending kill...everything else was mid at best.
Calling it before I see it: theyll make Alex win, but I want Cole to win Edit: NVM, I WAS WRONG, YAY
Would love to see Wanda Vs Raven. I've had people say it's a draw
Bro prototype was my favorite game when I was younger
Assassins creed free for all all assassins vs each other
Esto me recuerda a una épica batalla...
I knew and no one believed me
After the years i've waited to finally see this episode I hella enjoyed it, and im very glad my boy Cole won the fight. I thought Alex would've taken it but Cole managed to pull off the win somehow, thank you Death Battle for this amazing episode.
Me skipping the death battle to see the next one being Frieza vs Megatron.  This has got to be a joke.
Prototype still has cult following and I think Activision should make III. Hopefully with the OG team.
Death battle is so much better when you don’t know anything about either combatants.
This fight was excellent and was worth the wait
cole was a vampire to….just saying
Practically alex could easily kill cole.  I disagree with the outcome.
🧁muffin button🧁
It's too bad they didn't like working on this episode. I think it turned out great!
The world is not perfect, but it could do better without you.
What next James Heller vs Delsin Rowe?
My bet was in Alex Mercer before i started watched this, because Prototype games are familiar to me, and Infamous are not.
Didn't even go into Kesler deep enough. Future Cole had time travel, which meant that he could have had backup from his future self, or even Alex's own future rival, Heller
So what do you think the names of Wiz and Boomstick’s evil counterparts should be? Sourcer and Shotgunner? Let me know your ideas below.
That was a damn good matchup!
I loved playing Infamous 2 when I was younger, its a shame it wasn't ported to the ps5 and xbox series x
This Death Battle, Cole and Alex…I find it boring… Frieza vs. Megatron, however…F*CK YEAH!!!
I’m glad an awesome DEATH BATTLE came out on my birthday!
Infamous had vampire dlc
Next is Dragon Ball vs. Transformer!? Dang, that is a crazy battle!
Are you for real?
Yeah Cole win
You forgot about the vampire part
Its been a long time since I last heard of these two series. Didnt think they would be featured in death battle after all these years.
15:51 hey Alex, ever heard of cutting downwards? It’s possible.
I read this awhile ago so it’s sad Ik how it ends. Oh well it’s still sick
I absolutely LOVE the infamous franchise, including second son. Hoping to see Delsin in a future death battle 🔥🔥
Please do Dexter (Dexters Laboratory) vs. Jimmy Neutron (The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron).
12:57
"Read your mind like Goku's Muffin Button." 😅 Someone has been re-watching DBZA!
I knew it 🤔😏
Spoiler for next battle               Does Megatron actually have a chance here idk much about transformers lore but I don't see him winning here
At least five years wishing for this. I'm not dissappointed at all. Thank you, death battle team 👍
Lol yeah it should’ve stayed a draft
Oh no, not dragon ball again.
carvo atano next
Sorry I was late
frieza seems a little too overpowered for megatron....but we'll see if the comic books ever gave him the edge hed need to win.
Gooooo Mercer!!
ok that was one of the best fights i've seen in like 3 years.
Shoulda used heller..at his strongest he could shoot green lasers control gravity..make other people zombies...and generate behemoth monsters feom his bio mass....i still think cole would have a good chance at winning but heller would have been a much harder opponent
Megatron vs. Freiza is up next!? Does Megaton even stand a chance against Black Freiza, presuming that we have more information than him knocking out MUI Goku and UE Vegeta in one punch?
Good
Koji Kabuto From Mazinger Z Vs shinji ikari from neon genesis  evangelion
Awesome episode, i give it a 7/10. I feel they could have gone a lot harder with the fight if they wanted to, such as making Cole start out as a Champion and rank up to Hero, and Alex using a disguise that Cole deduces, but in any case, I am glad this won and I hope next year's 3D battle is at least as good as this one.
This is bs
My dream came true :)
I almost thought that was Kendrick on the track.
As someone who is a huge fan of infamous and loves the story of cole I am genuinely surprised. I fully expected him to lose this one but it's been forever since i played so i clearly forgot about some of his abilities
How can Cole steal Alex's bioelectricity when the latter isn't even human?
Frieza's reign of terror has finally arrived!!!
Gilgamesh fate/zero vs erza fairy tail
This was the most intense death battle I ever seen!!!! I LOVE IT THIS WAS THE BEST BATTLE EVER!!!
Not many people is going to let this go that Cole actually beat Mercer. I'm a little disappointed that Mercer never even used his shape-shifting ability to throw Cole off-guard or consume people to regain his strength and abilities back. Seeing Mercer fight in this deathbattle is making me wonder why was he holding back against James Heller as the final boss in prototype 2 especially on the hard difficulty.
Damn… I’m pretty sure comic Megatron stomps Freiza
I dont really care who wins. I just want 2 of my fav characters to fight
Gonna be honest, I didn't think Cole had this one and was pleasantly surprised by the turn around at the end. Was a big fan of Infamous when it came out, as some have already said it was one of the best sandbox games I ever played and had a really good combat system.
They probably werent kidding about the script being a decade old because wiz was literally making jokes about dbz abridged and goku's "muffin" button 😅
Ppl still remember prototype? Sweet.  Lol, that was one of the first games I ever pirated
I hoped to see evil Cole MacGrath fight.
The only thing I’m saddened by the chance they both believe one or another is a terrorist I never liked evil Mercer but having both of them believing in killing one would save the world would have been better
I thought the nuke would make Alex the winner, guess I was wrong. Awesome it was
How many wife’s has boomstick had
KaiserNeko will be livid on that "FRIEZA"
Always confused me how Second Son happened if the conduits died?
An immovable object vs an unstoppable force
ALEX MERCER VS. VENOM
Very surprised. Never played prototype, but alex always came off as stronger
IM CURIOUS, NIDUS FROM WARFRAME VS THE MAIN PROTAGONIST OF PROTOTYPE 2 i forgot his name hehe
YESSS!
I have been actually waiting years for them to do this matchup. Glad it turned put the way it did😂🎉
This is no contest, Frieza is so going to win. The difference in power is significant.
Is it just me or Frieza could actually get an easy W
Here is a fun fact they didn't take into consideration alex doesn't just shape shift he becomes them all there memories are in him and he has eaten how many military personnel? 1000s 10,000s millions? Do you really think he would be a dumb mindless beast the level of intelligence he has is literally unbelievable not to mention he would get the hand to hand training they had i don't think this should have ended they way it did
the people need delsin from infamous second son vs. clive from ff16
Dont pretend their games aren't awsome.
How about Archangel from marvel vs Hawkman or Hawkgirl from DC.
One of the most interesting match ups with one of the worst incorrect outcomes. GGs though, Alex def does take this.
This death battle is long overdue I’m feeling the jam playing during this battle by the way.
I call bull!🙋🏾
Frieza vs megatron ummm this feels 1 sided
My younger self is satisfied with this event
Sanguinius vs Hawkman
Badass fight.
Lowkey thought Alex Mercer was gonna win, I'm honestly suprised.
PUCCA VS SAITAMA
Okay...is Megatron capable of some truly mind-blowing feats that I simply am not aware of? I cannot fathom how he could stand up to Frieza. Frieza easily destroyed planets when we met him, and has only got stronger from there.
PUCCA VS SAITAMA
Ummm...how is megatron vs frieza remotely fair?? Im a big a transformers nerd but this is as lopsided as it gets
The next battle is Frieza vs Megatron?
Jimbei(one piece) vs kisame(naruto)
12:59 Your Welcome!
finally, Frieza gets an official death battle
In my mind, this is what happens after the good ending of Infamous 2 and Cole Miraculously survives, to head back home and find this loser.
Naraku vs. All for one
We love infamous and prototype yeah because they are awesome and the best and the greatest and amazing and all ways wicked!!!!!.
Lol, Alex is "slower"? Have you PLAYED the games? You move around just as much as in Infamous, if not MORE.
What an awesome fight! Definitely a long time coming.. ⚡️
Gotdamn, why couldn’t either of these guys fight Ben 10??
I miss infamous so much
OF COURSE Cole won. Couldn't have ended any different.
Firstly Alex being evil isn’t cannon, he died to save the humans despite the raging infection going on, it’s his clone that wanted to dominate the civilians and rule.   Secondly I don’t recall cole having freezing powers.  Thirdly I don’t think cold could survive being mputated, I mean he can get shot and bruised and he could heal himself but amputations that Alex is good at. I reckon alex would win.   Though I’m not a geek when it comes to either, maybe the real Alex mercer is t hint on the sidelines eating popcorn while his evil clone dukes it out with cole McGrath.
Frieza vs Megatron 😕 wtf really
Well that was unexpected 😲
I waited 9 years for this Death Battle. Totally worth it.
This actually surpirsed me, I was team Cole but i actually thought Alex was gonna win based off his healing factor and consume cole successfully
has anyone done a death battle tournament? take 8 characters from all the fighters they done in all the videos and see with one is the best of the best and gets the death battle trophy. only the winners of the fight videos can do the tournament.
I know Sucker Punch is focused on Ghost of Tsushima right now, but they really need to revive this franchise and Cole along with it.
Cole MacGrath vs. Alex Mercer (Sony's InFamous vs. Activision Blizzard's Prototype)
I loved infamous. I know it's unlikely but a remake or remaster would be awesome sauce! Sorry, I had to Boomstick.
Finally, after skipping two episodes in a row, the next one is finally gonna be a match-up that I actually give a damn about.
I came here to make fun of the people who thought Mercer would win, but now I just feel bad. Recover friends.
If I had a nickel for every PlayStation exclusive character that is insanely overpowered in the way that they're written but very poorly translates over to gameplay, I would have two nickels. Which isn't a lot but it's weird that it's happened twice.
This just makes me realize how much i miss both franchises.
Ok, now we just need you to find another old script about Asura from Asura's Wrath. I don't even care who you pit him against, just want to see all the little calculations about how hard the God of Wrath can punch.
Cole vs Storm plis
As much of a Megatron fan I am, theres no way he can beat Frieza. Sure the strongest versions of him have been universal in scale, but DBS went multiversal long time ago and Black Frieza stands at the top of that totem pole at the moment.
I don't even follow death battle anymore but I had to come back for this one
oh god, next time is gonna be a 6 hour long battle full of transformations and stalling
Stupid Death Battle idea:  Sylvester and Tweety versus Tom and Jerry.  Might be a good April 1st battle.
i hate that im paying for preium yet these guys still have to shove 2 ads down my throat
I already knew this would happen with coles electricity, it was obvious but alex couldve had a turn around maybe
Squidward VS Bob From Mugen
This feels like a case of "This guy can take a punch harder than the other guy, so he must win." I don't know who would win or lose, but their explanations are subpar. Keep in mind that I only played Prototype and not Infamous, so maybe Cole has tricks up his sleeve that would guarantee a win, but even in that case, Death Battle would just be even more incompetent in explaining their reasoning. For example, they say that Cole must be stronger than Mercer, but the gameplay of Prototype isn't always one of combat. It's about tactics and consuming so much biomass that tank shells stop being a nuisance. While Cole's radar would prevent Mercer from sneaking up on him in the traditional sense, if Mercer is fighting good Cole, then all Mercer would have to do is turn into one of the civilians he munched on and get behind Cole's guard. I don't think Cole has any virus sense in his radar. Force field doesn't matter much if you're pointing it at the wrong person. It is possible that Mercer's biomass would generate more bioelectricity since he keeps eating people, but Death Battle never considers such an approach. Another thing is that it isn't confirmed in the analysis that Cole absorbs 100% of the bioelectricity. At the very least, he absorbs enough to kill someone, but if the body still has energy, then it is possible that Mercer would survive. He just needs one cell to remain alive in order to come back, something Death Battle mentions. Could Cole absorb 100% of someone's bioelectricity? If he can't take away the energy from every single cell in Mercer, then it doesn't matter. Which leads to their argument that Cole can destroy on an atomic level. True, if Cole can do this, Mercer would lose. However, the examples they gave in the analysis suggest that Cole can target atomic structures but has not disintegrated anybody down to their last atom. Is Cole capable of destroying every cell, or can he only target specific structures?  Lastly, they mention that Mercer has to weaken someone before he can absorb them, and this is completely false. He has to weaken those infected with the virus to absorb them. But humans he can consume after grabbing them, which is why the human boss battles are usually the human in a tank or helicopter, requiring Mercer to beat up the vehicle first, or surrounded by threats, so Mercer has to sneak upon them. Cole could be absorbed the moment Mercer got within slapping distance.  Death Battle does argue that Cole can resist the virus, so Cole isn't in danger when Mercer is that close, but their explanation is nonsensical. Their argument is essentially, "Cole survived atomic damage, therefore he can resist the virus." But these are two different things. Viruses don't eradicate people on an atomic level. They hijack cells and force them to replicate more viruses. If Cole had the power to manipulate his atoms, sure, he could then just manipulate his atoms against the virus. But Death Battle's claim that "because Cole survived a nuke, he can survive anything" makes no sense. He may survive being ripped apart, but having your cells turn into virus factories are completely different.  Honestly, this is the reason why I don't watch Death Battle that much anymore. I can't help myself whenever I see a fight that I would love, but I keep leaving disappointed. If they're going to do this much research and put this much thought into the battle, they can at least put some effort into making sure what they say makes sense.
Reminds me of the time a reviewer was reviewing both games and they were tied , to break the tie, he asked the developers to put the other protagonist in a dress, a challenge Infamous developer won.
I believe Protoype and Hulk Ultimate Destruction used the  same gameplay engine.
It was obvious who was going to win THEY forgot Cole had something like spidey sense and evil Cole can create a black hole and more
"So hes basically a living super bomb waiting to go off" spoilers
I'm Curious, What Exactly Can Megatron Do To Counter Frieza's Feats And Abilities?
This fight was amazing, can't believe Cole won. And I'm SUUUUPER excited for Frieza VS Megatron
Loved Infamous, them middle school days. 😖
Dear god......................................that's alot.................
HELL YEAH! This was Epic!
Oh. Oh, poor Megatron. If you guys include manga stuff, Frieza will be way too strong for Megatron.
Man this made me smile this was dope
The story and battle is so well done I'm considering it canon.
The next match is gonna be the Hydrogen Bomb vs Coughing Baby of match ups. No WAY Megatron is beating Frieza  Also something something when Ultimate Kars vs Perfect Cell
OMGGGGG He WIN. HE WIINN
I really hope littlekuriboh voices freiza.
Alex mercer was techinally a villian Because he got betrayed  Villian are made not born ( expect lobo)
Would love to see Dominic torreto vs a a steel wall
Death Battle Subscribers ~ "Alex Mercer should have fought Marvel's Carnage." Frieza ~ "504." Death Battle Subscribers ~ "What’s that for?" Frieza: "I've heard specific cries of you monkeys so much I made a mental list for such lines." Death Battle Subscribers ~ "Are you gonna fight Transformer's Megatron?" Frieza: "190. And to answer your question, monkey, yes. Consider it a gift from you lord & master."
"The world isn't perfect, but it's a lot better without you in it". God that line is badass
We waited and waited. And it was worth it.
MY BOY WINS YEAH!!!! WE LOVE YOU COLE ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHARACTER IN PS3 ERA YEAAAAAH!!!
Awesome sauce
Man-thing(marvel vs swamp thing (DC)
Timmy turner vs The Collector (Fairly oddparents vs Owl house) Kaos vs Veigar (Skylanders vs League of legends) Xenomorphs vs Necromorphs (Aliens vs Dead space)
Yeah the moment Alex used his so called ultimate i knew they are gonna be biased as hell towards  Cole..alex had so many chances to consume cole but didnt yeah ok😂 Ah DB once were good now Bias after Bias
I'm amazed anyone was thinking about these characters! I've always felt that Prototype had such a good foundation to its story, but was rather wasted on the game that ended up being made. I just praised its story potential, and open world games have a long history of not making the most of their stories. They nailed the feeling of being this crazy powerful creature in a sandbox, but that's about it. Difficulty, importance of choices, uniqueness of events, investment in story ... all lacking. Now that story is kinda "taken", although it's limited success means there's a little room to take another shot at that kind of story.
Did they just day Muffin Button? Yea this was definitely a 2013 script
How long has it been since we saw a Death Battle where there was a massive size difference? I mean, Megatron vs. Frieza is a fight with a serious size different. Megatron is the size of a large building, while Frieza is roughly half the size of Goku.
Hey at least the next time isn't Frieza vs Mewtwo
THATS A WIN BABY!!!
Many have waited ages for this, but it's finely here
Animation still suffers from thidms modern stiff and fast style y'all do for some reason. Music was also bad and incomprehensible for the most part.
I want to see Asura from Asura’s Wrath vs Kratos from God Of War
I was on team Infamous back when these games launched. Good times.
Goku’s muffin button tho 🤣🤣
As a prototype fan...    This is the outcome i expected.
Damn, i bet On alex mercer🥲
Damn. It's the avatar: the last lightning bender vs scp 610: edgy edition
11:11 was my favourite part of this
Muffin button 02:12
God i miss hearing those words: "Lets end this debate once and for all."
Frieza is definitely going to win the next death battle hands down
Better late than never right?
megatron vs frieza we all know how that will end
Always love when they're able to make a situation where the characters would actually fight
What power tier is Megatron? We know Frieza is at least Universal+ so MT is gonna have to be somewhere close to compete with him.
Spoiler:             Tbh I was thinking Alex would win despite loving infamous. But I am surprised 😮
I was exoecting Cole to lose, but i still was rooting for him
Megatron and Frieza? Now that’s a tough one.
Infamous, one of the greatest games of all time. Its criminal how it didnt get a remaster, even prototype got a remaster haha come on Sucker Punch!
Pretty sure Alex has no electricity in him.
Frieza vs Megatron that's not fair at all...  Can it at least be Galvatron. After he was soaking on Charn...  Still doesn't win but at least will be interesting until Frieza went Golden
Prototype 2 is my favorite of the bunch. But I love Sasha the heroin monster.
Oh boy! I can't wait to watch next week's episode coughing baby versus atomic bomb 😂😂😂
Frieza vs Megatron.  I think Frieza got this.. Altough,I don't know much about Megatron or Transformers. What hexes,perks or abilities does Megatron have,since I'm sure he's outmached in power and speed...
12:58  For future viewings.
Ten years of waiting and I sure as hell am glad it turned out as awesome as this. Still can’t believe they had a script for this for so long.  (Though sure as hell know someone is going to be pissed at something in this and the next Death Battle)
Gokus muffin button???
Oh hell yea this is the sort of early 2010s debate that i watch this show for.
As a huge fan of Prototype series, we've been waiting for this fight for longer than a decade
I would like to see Delsin Rowe some time too.
Despite loving Alex Mercer a lot. i'm still very happy with this outcome and accept the outcome of thebattle quite well. because man. the battle was just so good.
Anne Boonchuy (Amphibia) vs Luz Noceda (The Owl House)
Dante vs spawn!!
Cool battle, but while Cole's body can withstand nuclear explosions (That conduits are resistant to), it doesn't have the physical durability of blacklight.  Cole does have more power at range, but as soon as alex closes the distance, which he can easily do as his parkour and run speed is much higher than Cole's, he could easily slice cole up or blow his head clean off with hammerfist.  I get deathbattle didn't want to have the edgelord character winning though.
Megatron vs Freiza is so one sided I’m surprised it was actually considered.  Megatron does not win that. And I’m saying this as a Transformers fan.
MY BOY MERCER IS FINALLY ON THE STAGE!
Black Freeza can OHKO UI Goku and UE Vegeta. I dont think Megatron wins ..
He mentioned Gokus Muffin Button from team four star lol had to do a double take.
Why did they not mention the fact he can produce spores that are in the air and a big ass red cloud thay infect like a mile out. Cole is fast but not that fast, ah, but the Death Battle somehow forgets this detail
Frieza vs Megatron is the single most lopsided battle in years Holy crap.  That being said, will be fun to see animated even if we know the winner
Prediction before watching: Alex wins easily. I’ve never played Infamous, but I know Alex survived a nuke. Sounds nearly unkillable with a huge arsenal to kill others.
Did Not See That Coming!
7:39 "(...) increased reaction time (...)" That's a serious debuff. Increased reaction time would mean that he reacts slower.
WTF?! 😊
I remember playing Infamous 1 on a friends ps3 and finding a handy bug/oversight. Random metal objects could be shocked by Cole, and they'd hold that charge for a short time. I found out that even when Cole was out of power he could use his basic shock attack. Well, I'd just spam that basic shock attack into a metal railing for a few seconds then absorb the power off of it which would refill my power meter.
Funny how the James Heller vs Delsin Rowe fight would go very very differently...
I never realized how similar their stories are
If IDW is used I see MT Winnin' but if it's just G1 Then freiza maybe.
No idea who these ppl are
For so long I had a hope that they would put in cole. Not one I had any realistic belief they would make since the game is old and even the franchise is more or less done anyway. Heck ya!
best thing I ever did gaming wise was keep my old Ps3 and catalog of games......I might give infamous another play through for old times sake
No way, they finally got Cole Macgrath!
As a fan of both i was surprised by the ending
This dude was better off fighting a symbiote from marvel tbh at this point
They're gonna have to come up with some OBSCURE Transformers lore to try and justify how Megatron stands even a slight chance against a guy who blows up planets for fun.
It Pikachu vs Venom but it 2000 edgy
My money was on alex
Seriously, screw this fight, yall got the information wrong on this part, how does surviving blasts have anything to do with POWER? THAT'S DURABILITY, NOT POWER
I don't see how Megatron can roll with Frieza, But look fiorward (especially his last two forms) to you trying to change my mind
prototype needs a hbo show
Bro, what do you mean the next fight will be frieza vs megatron? Literally the most unbalanced fight ever on this channel, megatron would be massacred with the weakest form of frieza 😐
Thought Alex would take it.
Remember Yahtzee crowshaw got the 2 games developers to send him a picture of the opposing games protagonist wearing a bra based off a joke in a ZP video
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😢❤❤❤😊
As a fan of both Cole and Alex as torn as I am this was still an amazing match up
lame af
2 games that look amazing that I completely slept on when they launched, to be fair they launched in during a time when I had 0 time for videogames, recently turned 18, starting to get my life together and stuff, but damn I wish I had played both, they look amazing! also... Freeza(its the correct way to spell it) vs Megatron? That... seems unfair, extremely unfair, unless you guys don't use Black/Golden Freeza
Cole 4 Life
18:22 YOU GOT THE TOUCH!!!!  YOU GOT THE POWWWEEEEEEERRRRR……  YEAH!
Frieza vs Megatron? Do we let you guys deal with another DBZ character. When you can't even do a proper Ichigo scaling lol. I mean look at Goku. We know how this story goes.
Freeza VS Megatron💀
Still pushing for Commander Shepard vs Master Chief
Megatron vs Frezea? Look im a big TF fan but even I think thats a silly match up. I dont see how Frieza can lose that one. But I am interested to see how it plays out.
this next match should be interesting, besides 18 noone else has won a death battle from dbz
Freeza vs Megatron? Really? How does Megatron stand up to someone who beat ui goku AND vegeta with 1 hit?
I'm still waiting for that nuraku vs muzan
Negation stands literally zero chance against Frieza! Wtf is that matchup?
Welp I'll sleep well tonight😊
I knew Cole McGrath would win!
Yep. This screams 2013
Saw this ending from a mile away, Cole destroyed the Conduit Gene across the world from a place that shouldn't have allowed him to, and evil Cole would have destroyed Mercer in a second
When in doubt, go with the one who can generate and throw around lightning...
After 10 years when these games came out, they finally made it... and it was epic!
It’s kind of fun to watch the videos where I know little to nothing about the two characters because I have be more objective and less biased
Maaan I moss Cole McGrath, I wish we can get a remaster of infamous 1 and 2
Finally ended this debate in my house
Wait, isn’t the nuclear bomb based on the idea that you can turn matter into energy? Isn’t that why Einstein felt responsible for nukes?
I just think the outcome is wrong. I don't believe Cole can recover from a brain injury. If Alex can land a hit I just don't see Cole surviving him.
next time in death battle...    golden?
U give loser look good frist
Hey death battle let's do Robot Boy vs XJ9
Love it absolutely i couldn't decide who to root for
I hope for bugs bunny vs mickey mouse if you guys are able to please?
I bet Mercer wins.
5:29 soooo are we getting him in a Death battle soon as well? Don't wait 10 years please.
18:29 FINALLY, It's Frieza's turn. I wonder who will come out as the Victor? Can't wait to find out.
Regardless of anything, please empty out your trash can regularly. But thanks for your godlike entertainment throughout the years.
finally I got my two favorite game characters to duke it out like no one's business, I am sated.
Awesome video!  You guys should do John Wick vs Jason Bourne :D
inFAMOUS 1 and 2 were always some of my favorite games in my late childhood and early teen years, and I even cosplayed as Cole for Halloween for a few years using the bag from the inFAMOUS 2 Hero Edition (my first collectors edition too).
I'm going for Alex! Dude is super op, I loved the prototype game!
Im so happy that Cole won
How TF is Frieza and Megatron related? A robot vs alien? Weird matchup again.
Glad cole won, love both series but infamous was the better written game with better feats, still remember how sad the ending of infamous 2 was.
Being 100% honest, i was rooting for Cole but seeing Alex's abilities, i really tough Cole was done for, until that last part, that makes so much sense that i love it.
🧢
The bnex mayltch up is going to be interesting.  Both have survived planetary levels of destruction, or outright caused it, both can survive in space and both can fly.  I see frieza winning it though. Megatron is powerful, i just don't see him having the power and speed to take on Frieza though, even if tgey somehow manage to work in him turning into Galvatron, which, canonically with this version, only happened through being reconfigured by Unicron. At leadt with the version they seem to be going with, that is. And since outside help is forbidden, like Vegeta going ssj4 with the help of bulma and the blutzwave machine, i don't see that happening.
0:27 Legit thought this was an old battle that I missed from years ago till I clicked on this lol.
Man megatron finna get cooked.
Boooo lol I was hoping Mercer would win. Oh well
No way! My boy won. I’m kinda shocked by the result
When has cole been this durable to physical damage?
Ok, whose idea was the next one?
Raziel from Soul Reaver.
2000 Aughties Deathbattle and I am fully invested.
1:39 what is that scene from?
I’m feeling the 2000s flow through this posted  Edit: I kinda wish vilgax was frieza’s opponent. I kind of hate the size difference between frieza and megaton where it’ll be hard to see how frieza’s combat style works against someone big like megaton
Al día edd tolerante ❤️👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
How epic would it be if we had a death battle with Boomstick🧨 vs Wiz🤖  I wonder who would win🤔
They need to just make this a movie
Frieza vs megatron is such a mismatch oh my goodness
did alex just pull a blanka move? 💀
For the first time in a bit I don't disagree with this outcome at all honestly nicely done
Your reasoning for Cole being able to resist the virus is a humongous reach!!! Not only that but Alex can survive a nuclear explosion but gets COMPLETELY obliterated by electrical powers?!?! Jesus death battle sucks!!!!
Welp, now yall know yall have to do delsin rowe now.
Prototype Fans are crying 😂
This felt like a typical hero vs villain plot... Nevertheless amazing animation
Love how Wiz does not make jokes about Boomstick's ex-wife anymore. A true friend
1. Happy birthday to my mother  2. I somehow enjoy Cole being able to win 3. Frieza vs Megatron?! Even if both are Villains, I don’t know who to cheer for!
Yeah, Team Cole FTW!
I’m surprised yall didn’t take into account Festival of Blood (the vampire story) for Cole
Frieza vs megatron… I am oddly looking forward to that fight
Wow. I thought Alex was gonna win but I'm glad pulled out the UPSET! Yes. Been waiting for this DeathBattle for years.
Whooo! Go Cole!
FRIEZA VS MEGATRON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🥵
What the....?
I always wanted a fight between these two SO HYPED
:)
A mutated character wins
Well.. Frieze vs Megatron is certainly unexpected..
Looks like I'm gonna have to play the infamous games for the first time!
Are we gonna get Dark Sector vs Crysis 2?
Are they ever gonna make Doomsday vs SCP-682
13:19 FIGHT!
Megamind vs Despicable. Let make this happen internet
Wait.... i beat infamous both good and bad ending, dont remember that.
Cole absorbing a scourge KNOWN for absorbing people for their abilities is great, I just wish I could see his...beast form against a worthy opponent.
lol i knew when people were saying they are using good cole that he would win and part of the argument would say if they used evil cole it would be an even bigger stomp
So... when is Delsin Rowe vs James Heller (Infamous: Second Son vs Prototype 2)?
Uhhhhh…. The next matchup… no spoilers but… bruh
love it when the good guy wins
Frl? Frieza vs megatron?  Easy frieza win hahah 18:33
After all these years I knew Cole could beat Alex 🎉
Nah unreal
Frieza vs Megateon is one sided af😂
All Hail The Saint Cole MacGrath!!!
Friese vs Megatron make no sense
Wrong.
Can someone please explain frieza Vs megatron to me I’m so lost.
Makes me wonder how strong Heller is given he beat a juiced up version of Alex before absorbing him
Spoilers     The Prototype's termination just became Infamous
I can practically feel the huge amount of satisfaction everyone has for the victory!
well you can see who i liked better clearly but I knew how this was going to end having played both games
this is definitely gonna be a personal favourite episode
YES!! FINALLY!! FRIEZA VS MEGATRON IS NEXT BABY!!
I really do miss the Infamous series. Second Son was great but I'd love a reboot of Infamous with just Cole again.
Frieza vs megatron seems so one sided on the surface but now that I think about im actually curious I don’t know alot about transformers but I’m excited
Man I wish someone would bring both of these franchises back from the dead.
Glad Cole won👍.
Just out of curiosity. Am I the only one who considered this an old style episode just cause of the runtime being less then 20 minutes? The jokes felt in between old and new, wiz saying let's end this debate once and for all.
Yeag
Can we have a death battle with Grim from Billy & Mandy?
Vegeta: Screw U Bastards I’m The Ultimate Life-form HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
I wonder how the next match-up is gonna go? Y’all got any predictions?
I always wanted to play these games I hope someday I can
I was worried the Cole might lose, but I didn't think the outcome would be a relief
Monkey d luffy vs Mr fantastic
No you guys dropped the ball not doing this earlier but picked it back up by doing it in todays death battle style
Top 5 Death Battles oat
Ah infamous and prototype a blast from the past
Muffin button
I can guarantee the debate wont ever end😂
So, it's basically one died a hero while the other lived long enough to become the villain
Frieza vs Megatron? Megatron is fucked.
Cole McGrath sucks good I guess
Accelerator vs Ken Kaneki
Rip Freiza
"You're one sick freak!" "Freak? Well, isn't THAT the pot calling the kettle Blacklight?"
Legit know nothing about either dude but the Cole is from the PlayStation Demo that you could play at Walmart back in the day so I like him : )
Please do  Vash the Stampede vs Spike Spiegal!
this is the best birthday gift you can give someone, thanks death battle, pretty cool.
He killed him like he was max stell
Well now this death battle makes me want to see a crossover that I doubt will happen 😢
It was... AWESOME!!!!!  I didn't play infamous, but on some level I was sure that Cone would win.  Mercer was superior in brute strength, experience, and regeneration speed; however, Cole had the ability, overall strength, durability, absorption ability, it was all there.    Now I will wait for: Asura vs Kratosa Spawn vs Ghost rider
Can we get a Guyver vs Blue Bettle
Man.... I kinda wanted Alex to win, 😅
I've been waiting to see this fight thank you death battle👍🏾
Freeza versus Megatron! 🤦🏿‍♂️😂 This isn't even a fight!!!
This is gonna be awesome
18:24 never thought of any single more One Sided Battle in DB until Now
I feel like this made fans of the games really happy, because this was awesome to watch! Also for the next battle, I'd like to see them list Freeza's durability feats.
The music is hype
Odin vs Zeus?
Hellz yeah!!! I can finally go on with my day in bliss 😌
Still waiting for Hellboy vs. Death from the Darksiders games. Some day...
LETS GOOOOOO
The next fight has to be a joke fight right?
My favorite fight so far, that was crazy
I don't agree.
Good video, I’d love to see Evil Cole make an appearance
Megatron vs. Frieza as the next fight? I don't think G1 Megatron's gonna win that one, considering how crazy strong Frieza's gotten in Super (even if they include IDW Megatron's antimatter stuff).
Frieza vs Megatron. Alien dictators fighting to the finish. White Lizard who gained both the Grammy and  the black card super forms vs the robotic general of the Decepticon Army who can sometimes become Galvatron. Obvious Answer is Frieza while the underdog answer is Megatron for me.
Def  surprised ending ...
THAT WAS BADASS!!!
12:57 for death battle
I was surprised we didnt get a dragon ball match till now this season, but of all the matchups I did not expect them to actually put Megatron against my boy
In retrospect, maybe it’s not so bad it took them this long to make this episode, they had the time to develop and improve animations a ton.
Lame. Alex should have won.
I think they should do a fight with Talion from Shadow of Mordor/Shadow of War and Geralt from the Witcher 3 or whichever game peak Geralt is.
Plot twist Alex left a drop of his blood somewhere so he can regrow himself
It was so good seeing Cole win this fight and I miss playing both infamous games. They were freaking good 🔥🔥🔥
Initially I was really confident in cole winning, then i saw some compelling alex arguments and started sweating lol, glad my boy cole pulled through
And no one is gonna talk about Vampire Cole?
Oh boy, I can't wait for the digital salt mines to be reopened
The fight we didn't know we needed.
Frieza vs Megatron eh?
FRIEZA! THE RACIST GOD IS FINALLY HERE!!
LETS GOOOOOOO
WHOO TF SAID MEGATRON VS FRIEZA WAS A GOOD IDEA????????
This is just in, Cole > carnage
Death Battle suggestion, Sterling archer vs Austin Powers
Now do the black one vs the second one
I feel as though it should be said as it seems to be misunderstood, but Heller didn't finish Mercer. While it is true that he consumed him, before doing so, he removed discarded and forgotten the limbs he ripped off. Meaning that Mercer was not killed by Heller but temporarily beaten, a subtle thing to note but fairly obvious if you played the game
Boomstick’s future just got revealed. He leaves DeathBattle and becomes a rantsona channel.
Steal your power huh? Thanks for the tip
I don't really think this would work how you think it would. The battle ends with Cole absorbing Alex's powers, but... I don't think he could do that. With other conduits, whose powers are built on the same basis as Cole's are, sure, but with a unique set of powers disconnected from that, it seems unlikely, and without him being able to do that and thus unable to negate Alex's regeneration, I just don't think Cole could finish this fight.
It only took ten years to make this match-up reality. Another ten for Duke Nukem vs Serious Sam. I'll be waiting.
Yeah..unfortunately, Prototype 2 was a result of this outcome. Alex should have won this fight, I like both characters. However, during the animation they made cole look way better & smarter, but they claim that alex is smarter & experienced...I didn't see that at all. And the anaylsis was strange (in my opinion). they gave cole bio-leech even though that is a evil cole action. Good cole restrain enemies, because that's considered a heroic action. Strike 1, cole also did not "defeat" the beast, he had the help of nix, and zeke, also he had to use the RFI because he could not actually kill the beast, in fact cole got bodied by the beast in his first encounter & the beast destroyed empire city, so you can't actually give him that victory by himself. Every fight alex fought he  overwhelmed the enemy on his own, or even came up with a plain to win. This DB just makes him look like a joke. Trying to reason with cole? why would he have to...lol. cole also had unlimited electricity throughout the entire fight? really, not once did he need to drain lights or generators? Alex could have thrown cole into the lake, or even consumed zeke to find out his weakness.
Frieza vs Megatron o.o interesting...
The dialogue gave my edgy Twenty One Pilots fan boy energy
Reptile (MK1) vs Riptor (Killer Instict)
Did y'all seriously use an old-ass script?
i know nothing about either series, what i do know is alex looks super badass. and cole has some awesome powers. need to check these games out soon
Ride the powerlines like static
Amazing job, really nailed the violence. Cannot wait for the next battle
I feel like James Heller vs Venom would be a good matchup. It's then a matter of who could absorb who
Really wish they continued the Prototype games.
Yo frieze vs megatron lol I didn’t even think that would be possible 😂
Wow, reading the comments i found out that a lot of people were expecting their favorite character to lose, which really goes to show how much one can lowball his fighter taking into account the enemies abilities, so for once i want to say i'm happy Cole beat Edgy Mercer
Ghost rider vs spawn
2 game franchise that arguably have so much potential and should be put in the hands of a creative studio that will do them justice! 🙌🏽 One can hope 🙏🏽
Someone please give me the name of that epic sound track I need it in my life😭😭😭so fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Can we get a death battle between v from cyberpunk and whatever character could stand a chance
I don’t even know both characters, I just want to see who wins
Literally nerfed Cole for the fight by making him good and he still won. That's amazing.
evil cole fight would have been more appropriate, since they basically have the same ideaology (eg, purging humanity in order to change it into something new)
Shadow the Hedghehog won!
Not going to lie, but Cole shutting down Alex's speech of a 'better world' bull crap is oddly satisfying. Goes to show how well written the character arc is for Cole, while Alex still stuck in the same place he always did because he let the choices of the few taint his world view on humanity. While Cole is always changing, Alex never seems to change. Ironic knowing Alex has power over evolution.
This isn't a fight
I agree with the matchup being more than a little late, considering that inFamous came out in 2009, basically along side Prototype. With the second games coming out in 2011 and 2012 respectively. The time to do this matchup was probably 2013 or at worst around the time of inFamous: Second Son in 2014. That said, as soon as they made it clear that Cole worked on the moleclear level versus Alex on the DNA level, it was a wrap for me.
MY BOY COLE MADE ME SO PROUD! I HAVEN'T FELT THIS GOOD IN FOREVER!!!
We're missing something important here and thats both these guys in women's underwear with the other developers logo on them.
They nerfed Cole and high balled Alex and he still lost.
nice, I predicted correctly... the fact Cole is far more powerful and even a bit more versatile than Alex really makes the gap here... the biggest advantage Alex has is corruption and the regenerative immortality... but I didn't even remember that Cole had feats of defeating regenerative enemies before... with that feat it's an easy win!
Take this mercer w4nkers!
You know, that does explain why Alex was evil in the next game. I thought the virus corrupted his mind or something. Epic fight and I can't wait for the next one!
Muffin button!!!!
I remember playing infamous at a gamestop and prototype from someone i know such cool and awesome games😊
Frieza is going to win. Also I thought the next one is Jaden Yuki vs Ben 10
I've been waiting for Megatron to show up in Death battle ever since Optimus Prime got put into death battle
Man, it's like Chad was super pissed that this Death Battle won the poll...Like, want to find every last one of you and beat you to death with a Louisville Slugger pissed
Duke Nukem vs Postal guy would be an incredible match
Ok now work that death battle curse magic and get me a new infamous game 😂
Megatron, cool!
Ippo vs little mac
I have a feeling that Megatron is going to get wrecked. I want him to win because im more of a Transformers fan than i am  dbz FAN but Freiza its EXTREMELY powerful when Megatron is not.
I WAITED YEARS FOR THIS
I mean, i liked it, but after following the crazy ride that was bill vs discord, it was meh.
Why don’t we get more animation like this instead of just using the arcade version all the time
ASURA VS KRATOS!!!!!!! THIS WILL BLOW UP THE INTERNET
We Get A Remastered Or A Remake Of The First Two Infamous Games Please.
Will we see black frieza in the next death battle?? 👀👀
Oh come on, Frieza Vs Megatron has got to be the most one-sided thing ever. Calling it now, Frieza wins. Especially if they add his current form.
"The only vermin I see, IS YOU!" The rest of the fight was the Cole Show, I have not felt that comeback feeling since Balrog vs TJ Combo
En serio que acabo de ver en que mundo cole le gana a Alex mercer por que en primera ahora tiene energía infinita y además la fuerza de Alex tendría que superar por mucho a la Cole es imposible que tuviera un combate cuerpo a cuerpo con alguien así y el aumento de poder que le dieron al final que fue eso el tipo se convirtió en Sans o que
Awesome
You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain
The lampshades are everywhere!
Frieza vs megatron, wow that’s a match up I never thought would happen
Normally a fight between a mage and a melee fighter, the melee fighter has the advantage due to attack speeds and defense.
So the fact that alexs can regen from a single drop of blood or cell dosent matter ? like all blood from the ice or any time during the fight ....or the fact that the blacklight would 100% work on on cole because its a virus not a mental attack so it would infect him and would still work on him during a comic about cole he gets sick so that kinda proves it .....also the last attack would 'kill alexs " but the blood and cells threw out the fight would just bring him back cole isent smart enough to figure it out plus cole cant out heal alexs ....when alexs stab alexs with his claws he would end up dying from blood loss ? also whats stopping alexs from releasing the virus to infect everyone around him and make a army then just idk absorb him to power up....this is another death battle where yall dident do enough research again like toph vs gaara and many others.
The GOAT WON 🐐⚡️
Dude Frieza vs Megatron is totally mismatched
Ghos rider ( Marvel) vs denji ( chainsaw Man ) please
Would’ve be interesting to see evil Cole vs Alex
Had no idea i needed this. Thank you guys.
After Freiza wins, can you guys please pit Sailor Mercury against Aquaman?
Fureza vs Megatron?! Ight then, thats definitely interesting!
Freeza and Megatron ? Total curbstomp, freeza takes the easy win
15:57 a heroe
Somehow I knew this was going to come down to a durability test. Also the next match up is strange and I know the stats of one of the contenders all too well.
Does Megatron stand a chance against Frieza?
Ashita no joe vs hajime no ipoo when!? Takamura vs rikishi would be heat, both having beaten beasts afterall
James heller vs Delsin Rowe the sequels who would win
Cole is similar to Buzz in the Disney movie Lightyear, he truly cleaned up the mess he made, no spec of dust was swept under the rug. I think Frieza would win the next battle.
".. If Kirby listened to Linkin Park."  That line ended me.
2:14 I heard that TFS reference!
thing is, if you beat the game with each path, you unlock the third playthrough that gives you BOTH sides of powers
Did not see that ending coming
All for one vs Orochimaru battle of the body snatchers.
Please make UBER JASON VS DOOM SLAYER
Yeah but Alex is still cooler
I can't say I ever say I grew up with these characters, but to those who did, I'm so happy for you now that this finally happened.
Cole's one of my favorite characters in Videogames and I thought this battle was one sided into Alex's favor. Glad to know I was wrong. If i knee Cole could attack at the atomic level I wouldn't have had that opinion.
This marks the first playstation character to win a fight
This Death Battle sure isn't perfect, but the world is a lot better with it in it.
Cole macgrath is awesome
as much as I wanted Alex to win I can see why Cole won, even if Alex was able to consume some of Cole's blood to gain his powers it wouldn't matter because he wouldn't have the knowledge on how to use it.
Rick vs Stewie
Bro FREIZA VS MEGATRON! HELL YEAH
15:57 Cole's heroic second wind.
You all captured hero Cole excellently at the end. Makes me wish we got another game with him.
This is every 2013's edgy teenager's dream
Once i heard that cole could consume dna i knew it was over for alex if cole did not have that alex would totally take the win
Since I played both games this was a win for me 😊
Those first 2 infamous games are legendary. Too bad they havent made a proper third or remaster
Next time i would love to see fairy tail natsu vs fire force shinra death battle
10:31, “Anime villain” is exactly how I thought Alex was like in the second Prototype game, especially with his exaggerated gestures when explaining his plans to Heller.  11:12, Speaking of Heller, thank you for focusing on him for a bit. His dialogue and line delivery was awesome and conveyed all the frustration and rage you’d expect a character in his position to be feeling.
Wow, you could never guess which of the 2 poll winning fights had more interest, money and passion put into it by the team.  (Note, I do not mean to slight the animators who did a very good job in this fight, but the writers didn't even bother to hide their contempt for the material).
Huh.  Was honestly expecting Alex's damage output to overwhelm on this, but I completely forgot about Cole's bio drain.  Guess even a living pile of biomass would be vulnerable if the energy powering its cells was drained.
YES THE PATRON SAINT OF NEW MARAI WINS!!!!
I want to see baki in a death battle but idk against who
Yeah, I had a feeling that Alex would lose.
Finally this is coming!
Frieza vs IDW Megatron let's go
I'm not a fan of either series but that analysis seemed incredibly disrespectful to both, genuinely believe these are the worst analysis' of the season, but man that fight was GOOD!
One sided death battle  incoming next .... 1 million  on freeza
I never played either of these things, but I was always confused by how similar the two games seemed to be. At least in how they were advertised.
This fight was about what I expected, but it was still a lot of fun! I'm so happy that these two powerhouses finally got pitted against one another.
That, and enough electricity can and WILL destroy Alex like microwave cooker.
YAY!!!! THE GOOD GUY WON!!!  I Was Rooting for Cole the ENTIRE TIME!!
Do Kawaki vs boruto  I think that would be crazy to see
Ok, so good karma vs carnage.
That music was awesome!
So for this battle they turned Alex into a mindless beast who’s solo and with no tactics. In the games Alex has a superior healing factor, infiltrated top levels of government and had an army of bioweapons, all of them having part of Alex in them as part of his hive mind. He’s also absorbed top scientific and military minds and would be able to outsmart Cole as a master tactician. He could easily use his hive mind’s vast information network to identify Cole, his friends and family, then absorb them to learn his weaknesses. And considering he can infect the surrounding population and turn civilians into bombs, DB really missed how much more ruthless Alex is compared to (hero) Cole. Plus Alex could only be truly killed if every person infected by the Blacklight Virus in his hive mind is destroyed, and Heller could only do that after absorbing all of Alex’s memories. Is Cole stronger and faster? Sure. Did DB take into account Alex’s genius hive mind level intellect, the army under his direct control and the vast amount of resources he possesses? No.
i am genuinely SHOCKED that deathbattle hasnt done this battle in like Forever
James heller: maybe your power is top but you always be the SECOND, SON  Delsin: you believes are the perfection but only are a PROTOTYPE
Freiza gonna piss on megatron
Would frieza not absolutely destroy megatron?
Frieza vs megatron i can't wait. Either one winning would make me gassed
The soundtrack is dope. This death battle is coooolll 🔥 🔥
So Freeza vs Megatron is next. Well, I don't know all that much about Transformers, but in the handful of series I've seen of it Megatron never came close to planet busting on his own. So I'mma go ahead and predict Freeza.
Frieza vs megatron. Frieza could win, but so can megatron.
Wtf is up with the next matchup xD
Can read minds like Goku's muffin button...
Wait a minute, the bioleech is an evil karma power, so how come good cole can use it ? i thought they said they were following the good karma cole so that means he wouldn't use evil karma powers
When I saw the thumbnail I thought this was going to be starkiller,
MEGATRON IS FINALLY IN A DEATH BATTLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Dead Space vs The Callisto Protocol Isaac vs Jacob
I had suggested Cell(DBZ) VS S-Cells(One Punch Man)
we're surprises that once they start talking about heller killed Alex they didn't talk about the theory.
Okay, but...what if *WATER???*
MUFFIN BUTTON
This debate was settled 15 years ago with a bikini contest.
Freiza vs Megatron?!?! How is that even a far comparison?
We need a bill cipher vs monika
2:14 I'm sorry, was that a motherfucking TFS reference?!
"read your mind like Goku's muffin button" is that a DBZA reference!! 2:13
Worth waiting 10 years!
2:13 Love the TFS reference
Yes!!
Nah f that
FRIEZA VS MEGATRON?!?!?!
Death Battle has to stop telegraphing the victor, it's boring when you know who is going to win in the first few moments
Ezio vs Agent 47
Who ever own the rights to [Prototype] needs to make a 3rd installment
Eu amo tanto os dois jogos, que nem fiquei irritado com o alex mercer, qual quer um ganhando me deixa feliz
really guys frieza vs megatron lmao i think this is just a filler for something bigger
we NEEEDDDD JUGUIROOOO HANNNNNDMAAAAAA
Frieza Vs Megatron? That's just a weird Match up. Wouldn't Frieza Vs Darkseid or Thanos or even Gorr the God-Butcher be a better one?
what about vampire cole?
Megatron is about to get stomped HARD
Hell yeah Cole won!! The amount of work that went into this is absolutely amazing!! This match was 🔥
Come on. Freeza vs megatron? Are they including black freeza who can drop gods in one hit?
For two series that haven't been relevant for years this was one epic fight!
Honestly, I'm surprised of this outcome...
Hear me out Chucky vs Megan or Bugs bunny vs sponge bob
As controversial as the next episode is, I'm glad we're getting Megatron for next time. More Transformers representation FTW!
Genuinely everything I wanted since 2009. I feel young again
Crazy how I thought about this when I was like 13 😂😂
Awesome death battle. Please do Delsin Rowe (Infamous Second Son) versus James Heller (Prototype 2)
Angry emo white boy batttttllleeeee!
I honestly prefer these death battles over the anime ones that I have no clue about any of the characters.
COLE WON HOLY CRAP I THOUGHT HE WOULD LOSE !!!!!!!
I am so glad that Cole McGrath won against Alex Mercer, I was wondering how he would counter against Alex’s regeneration and realized Cole’s Biomass leech power would help him win ultimately
YEEEEEEEAAAAH COLE WOOOOOOOOON I’M COOOOOOOOOOMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING
12:58 - [inHuman].  - Mount Lady vs. Giganta! (My Hero Academia vs. DC)  - She-Hulk vs. Power Girl! (Marvel vs. DC)  - Black Cat vs. Catwoman! (Marvel vs. DC)  - Galactus vs. Unicron! (Marvel vs. Transformers)
THEY FINALLY DID IT
VENOM VS STATIC SHOCK WAS AWESOME!!!
Can you do alex mercer vs carnage
Not gonna Spoil the next episode but how tf is that even comparable?
Childhood age long question has been answered!!!
They never mentioned that at Cole's peak, he could travel through time, which is how he was given his powers in the first place. Cole could theoretically travel back in time to before Alex was turned into the Blacklight virus and completely stop it from happening.
At around 15:51, simply BEAUTIFUL, also rooting and betting on Megs, should he able to his Alternity form, he should reasonably win, considering that even if Frieza scales to the Omni-King and stuff from the likes of Xeno and Heroes, which he doesn't, he would still be anywhere from multi-universal to potentially multiversal+, while Megs would be at least Dearf Star-High Complex Multiversal, so betting and rooting for Megs.
Megatron will not wait long before he assault us with salt
The next Death Battle is a stomp xd
Johnny gat vs Johnny cage plzzzzzzzzzz🥲
Most saying that this fight is likely Electro vs Carnage, but am i the only one who think that this is reverse of Black Adam vs Apocalypse?
Electro VS venom this going on in history book
Alex is strong, but being a lump of biomass fighting a guy that can forcibly shut your body off by draining you of all bioelectricity is a rough time Atomic disintegration is icing on the cake  You guys forgot Festival of Blood Cole, when he was made a vampire by Bloody Marry
Infamous was my favorite playstation exclusive series. Shame they don't do anything with it. And of course Frieza will win the next battle
This was an epic battle. While I didn’t know much about these characters learning about them was amazing. I couldn't tell who was gonna win and the track was amazing. Now I wanna play the games. Also I'm glad to see Megatron and Frieza be in their first battle, though in my head I wanted to see Megatron fight Ultron. Can't wait for the next battle!!!
This is sad.they probably wont use Deceptive Tyrants for the next one.
Cole is cool but I still think alex will find a way to come back alive
The more I think about it, the more surprised I am that neither of the original Infamous or Prototype haven't received a proper remaster.
Bro are you serious, frieza is gonna kick ass in the new fight lmao. His new transformation (black frieza) could destroy all of space, time and reality within a vast reach of space. Ain’t no way megatron is winning 😂
The excitement when the next Death Battle is getting announced and you see Gen1 Transformers Cybertron and think, "Unicron vs Galactus is finally happening!" Then the subsequent dashing of that excitement.
GW Cole.
First thought i had about the thumbnail was Starkiller
11:15 THE CHAD
15:18  That would have been the perfect chance to make a joke about Alex's hoodie.
James Heller vs Delsin Rowe fight let's go 🔥🔥🔥
Words can’t describe how long I’ve waited for this
Alex should have won the should have given him all his powers  he is more powerful then the showed  but whatever
Finally you guys actually gave us what we really wanted!  Thank you!❤
Can we PLEASE see more of Alex Mercer in the future?!
Ok I'm sorry, but there is no way Frieza is losing to Megatron
I’m so interested in Megatron vs Freeze, like he has no chance right?
ok, i lowkey thought alex was gonna win, cole sounded strong, and i did play a bit on infamous at one point, but god damn, when i seen alex, all i could say is jesus christ.
Can we get a new infamous sony please
I knew cole would win. No contest.
And just like that script, there goes my theories of why Alex is better then Cole down the trash... Dang it!
To be honest: never played Infamous or Prototype, but just based off the analysis, I didn’t know if Cole would have enough power to cellularly disengage Alex completely enough to actually KILL HIM! (As much as an artificially made virus can be killed.)
13:01 amd that where the battle starts
It feels like they downplayed Alex Mercer's intelligence; Alex started out as a scientist and absorbed countless other scientists and military officers & soldiers over the course of the games. I don't see why Alex couldn't lead Cole to a body of water and capitalize on his weaknesses.
the second the tendrils went into Cole it was over plus for Cole to drain them of electricity they need to be in a weakened state its why he never did it to people who where not weakened, and good Cole normally wouldn't drain people of energy because that makes them brain dead but leaves the DNA and body behind so even then ale would be able to just regrow since all the electricity is gone but the virus and DNA is left behind
We need a Rick Sanchez vs Kang
Frieza vs Megatron, huh. Should’ve been Frieza vs Mewtwo! Mewtwo deserved better in Death Battle
Thanks for seeing alex mercer again
Frieza vs Megatron?!! Hell yeah!!! Let's go!!!
Frieza vs Megatron for the next battle SHOULD be the shortest battle yet, considering that Frieza, in his FIRST, untransformed form state (before his 1st, 2nd and Final Transformations, before his Golden form, before his BLACK form) can literally BLOW UP A PLANET WITH A SINGLE FINGER.  Wiz and Boomstick are really gonna have to dig deep and reveal some unknown lore about Megatron that is going to put him on EQUAL grounds with Frieza.  Regardless, i know the internet is going to riot. 😂
Unsubbed
I thought Cole was gonna lose
Venom vs Alex Mercer. It will be interesting.
This was definitely a death battle where I was pleased and surprised by the outcome. This was definitely an interesting one and it was definitely without a doubt a close one. They were both iconic and famous powerful beings from two iconic games we’re fairly even with unique set of powers, but Cole was just more fierce than Alex. I mean while both may have been powerful and had a lot of versatility of powers in their own right, Cole’s allows him to handle oppositions almost just as crazy and have a slight edge over Alex where his own might and skills wasn’t enough to deal with Cole’s slightly vaster arsenal and electric powers…plus Video Game characters in general always have over the top powers that are just different to handle; but is always fun to watch. This was definitely a good fight, a battle definitely worthy of being one of the best out there as well as being a great clash between two powerful and iconic powerhouses. Honestly this fight could've gone either way and either one of these two could've come out on top, but Alex’s versatility just fell short when it came to the counters, speed and raw power of the infamous…Cole MacGrath  P.s. The next battle will be interesting, I'm curious to see how it will turn out between Frieza and Megatron since these are some outstanding villainous characters from two iconic franchises with interesting backstories plus the match-ups are pretty interesting and I’d love to see who would come out on top between these two iconic baddies. I have no idea how it will turn out for this battle (even if I have a slight idea how it will turn out...I honestly don't know who I'm routing for) but this will definitely be a great death battle regardless.
Probably one of the worst analysis of the season. Just wow that felt insulting to the fans of both
I feel like alex is gonna lose as muchbas i dont want him to
Off topic but I'm curious. Am I the only one that's tired of heroes winning in all media all the time? Games, movies, series, books, the heroes always win and while that's great I always find myself rooting for the villains just so I can see a different outcome
Day 1 of asking for Douglas Bullet or Kaido to show up in Death Battle
9:22 OH OH 😮
Chale el Tiranido perdio
What is that next fight 😂
Okay… I’m just before the actual battle. Please let them have a scene where they’re in braziers or something.
Carl Grimes(TWD) vs Ellie Williams (TLU)
Can't wait to watch Freiza obliterate Megatron.
The fight was underwhelming in this one.
These has same ability just like shadow the hedgehog
The next one is just unfair. I mean, Megatron _deserves_ it, but come on. You don't have to do him _that_ dirty.
Hell yeah
Cole MacGrath win death battle
Guys, Frieza v Megatron is heavily one sided, we all know Megs loses. Please, just do something else.
You're making a fatal conflation. Cole being able to resist the effects of something within his powerset makes complete sense, as does beings with the blacklight virus granting them strength resisting another. This should not cross over between verses because this isn't something even vaguely comparable, like how chakra would realistically resist spirit pressure from Bleach.  There should absolutely be nothing stopping Cole from being infected. Perhaps not easily, but through a grab or stabbing? Absolutely. Alex can consistently just devour anyone who doesn't have blacklight powers instantaneously.
SPOILERS FOR THE NEXT DB:        If Lanipator isn't voicing Frieza, then people are going to be pissed!!
This was a pleasant surprise. Definitely never expected that outcome but I'm definitely pleased with it and the fight itself was awesome. Solid Death Battle team good work.
Megatron vs freza? I'll take more transformers fights
Midnight Sparkle VS Nemesis Prime, Evil Twilight Sparkle VS Evil Optimus Prime, MLP VS TF
HELL YES!!! That was awesome!
The character that I like more lost so dislike🙂
Still waiting for Kamen Rider vs Captain America
Finally
Prototype fan here. Thought Mercer would obliterate. Not mad with the end result He just had the right thing to counter. 10/10
At the end of the day we can all agree       That both series deserve another entry into the franchise
Awesome, love it when the good guy wins. Doubly so since I was big Infamous fan back in the day. And this video kind of reminded me why; I forgot how genuinely cool Cole was, in more ways than one (including the way that’s an ice pun.)  It was nice to learn a bit about Prototype too though, since I never got a chance to get into that one. I can see why plot elements in the sequel were…controversial to the first game’s fans.  Next time: Frieza vs Megatron, huh? I know it’s popular, but I’ve gotta agree with Nem that it’s an odd match up when you think of it. They don’t have much in common besides being white & purple Space Warri…well that description doesn’t quite fit Freiza. Space conque…well that one doesn’t quite fit Megatron. Space Leaders?  Anyway this kind of seems like it’s sacrificing Megatron on the alter of Dragon Ball it’s such a stomp. But if there’s any versions of Megatron getting composited in that’ll give him a chance, then I’m rooting for him. I like rooting for the underdog you see; and even though I like Dragon Ball, the verse is so insane that the opponents always feel like an underdog.
Cole: Drain Alex  Conduit Killed: +50xp Drain: +1xp
Freezer Vs Megatron? Really?  I don´t think this is a good fight. Not because unless Megatron have something REALLY CRAZY hidden, Freezer wins without effort, but because we don´t know how strong current Freezer actually is, just that he is stronger than both Goku and Vegeta at the same time by a  big marging. But how big is that gap? Imposible to say right now.
Can't wait to have them make Frieza lose😀
How is NO ONE talking about the Frieza/Megatron battle !? Like who thought up this match!?
LETS GO COLE
What else but a great episode! That last shot is worthy to be on my PC
So was Prototype originally supposed to be a Venom/Carnage game that Marvel wouldn't give the character rights to?
For my untrained ear Freezer vs Megatron is a silly match-up, but I'm sure some deep transformer lore has Megatron busting planets with ease.
Like I've been saying for a decade, Alex wasn't winning that one. Time to finally pick up that phone people as for ten years, I've been calling it.
damn straight
Sure let's be 2008 again
I'm shocked at the outcome. Hehehe
Sakata Gintoki vs Kenshin Himura. Let's make it happen.
We know why this really happened,  It’s the greatest evil, Vs  The greatest good, And we know…the good guy will always prevail
Finally got the death battle that i always wanted that i might stop watching death battle as a series to tell how mush im satisfied for this video.
Every prototype fan ever, what!!! I did not for see this outcome. Wow.
Finally a win for Shadow the Hedgehog!
Bruh Frezia versus megatorn duh Frezia
I thought they were kidding when they said they were using a script they wrote in 2013
All these year later, and it’s finally here! Cool that people still wanted this battle even after the games stopped being relevant.
This is the worst episode if only for the Marvel humor.
Hellofresh is garbage
We need a Death Buttle between Wiz and Boomstick
The worse part of this fight is that they didn't keep the scream Cole makes when Alex throws him.
It's a freaking crime that both of these franchises aren't supported anymore. They are some of the most fun and unique sandbox games ever and they were just left to die for no reason
This fight was painfully cathartic. I learned about It was funny enough through Cole that I learned about Alex and I got both their games roughly in the same year and they were two “heroes” I respected the most. But when Alex fell from grace, even after reading the comics and empathizing with him, in the end, the only thing I wanted was to put him in the dirt for his actions.  In a way, this Death Battle was something I always needed and I'm glad Cole came out on top.
Feels good that they mentioned Delsin and James. One day we Will have them in death battle
Why did they make Alex evil again?
Johnny Gat vs whoever the main character of GTA is
Let's goooooooo!!!! I love Alex Mercer so much 😭😭😭
FRIEZA VS MEGATRON????   That's like putting a flintlock pistol vs an anti-tank rifle!!
Jimmy Neutron (Nickelodeon) VS Dexter (Dexter's Laboratory, Cartoon Network)
Sick animation and accurate conclusion; Cole is far stronger than what's presented (Kessler thinks he could beat his Beast who cracked the moon) and I don't think Alex scales to nukes outright. Cole grinding on a tendril like a power line was inspired!
Plastic Man VS Mr Fantastic
Next battle frieza acktually wins and g1 megatron is the only *canon* megatron(michael bayverse megatron is fake🤣)
I have been asking for this back in late 2010 when I use to have a Hotmail account lol
18:21  I can already hear Nemesis Bloodryche screaming in the distance!
So this fight made my balls tingle a little bit😂.   Goku vs Superman 3   Even though I like dbz way more more than D.C i know supes would probably win 🤦😂  Side note: Frieza vs megatron? Weird match up right
Stop ducking Luffy
The good guy won. I'm happy.
I completely forgot Cole can absorb the powers of other conduits.  So once he found out he can absorb the virus, Mercer was done
Do Sailor Moon vs Captain America Sailor Mercury vs Iron Man Sailor Mars vs Hulk Sailor Jupiter vs Thor Sailor Venus vs Hawkeye Sailor Uranus vs Captain Marvel Sailor Neptune vs Wasp Sailor Galaxia vs Thanos
Death Battles where one is good and the other is evil are my favorites.
Unless they use a OP Version of Megatron or a composite he ain’t beating Frieza. I even doubt that a OP version or composite would do the trick
That quote from The Dark Knight "You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain" couldn't be any more perfect for these two Cole died a hero and Alex lived long enough to become the villain.
Can someone give me good connections for freeza vs megatron?
Gotta say. I didnt expect this outcome. But it was great fight.
Zaraki vs alex merecer
As a huge infamous nerd, I didn’t think Cole had chance to be honest! I thought  Delsin could, considering he eventually learned to manipulate multiple element types, but didn’t really break it down to the molecular level like you guys did! What an episode. Cole is one cold MF.
Plus since cole had a easier solution to heal than alex did and had better reflexes and a larger variety of long range attacks gives him the edge since alex depends on absorbing others to heal and most of his attacks are close or mid range
why not freiza vs Mongol (dragon ball vs DC)
"My Death Battle prediction record hasn't been this bad since Season 3."  **cutaway to two negative hat tricks**
Cole magrath from tekken x street fighter-1 point Alex mercer from prototype-0 points Note:bad ending cole magrath was never canon🤣
I really want a new inFAMOUS game, no other franchise game me that feeling of freedom.
Well., as far as fights go...FFS guys that was amazing! i think that was one of the best or not the best fight you animated!
He wouldnt stand a chance against Heller
Wait, wont Cole be corrupted by virus if he absorbs Alex?
That song was fire though
So the fight actually used the weaker Cole? Thought they were meant to use the strongest iteration of each character? Not that it really mattered, either Cole could stomp Mercer.
Cole MacGrath is probably one of the best video game original super heroes ever created imo, I really hope we either get an inFAMOUS Remake or Reboot one day. I think inFAMOUS 1 and 2 had a more compelling story compared to Second Son.
I havent known these two franchises in 2009, but thanks to this confrontation requested by many people I have been attracted by their games and bizarre and dark stories (like Shadow The Hedgehog). And Cole and Alex's interaction is perfect. Not only is Alex the villain here, he also wanted to manipule Cole to use his power and change the world. Wonderful episode Death Battle
Megatron Vs Frieza? i feel like it's going to be a stomp like Korra vs Storm. Megatron being Korra.
Honestly never played either game so didn’t care for the match up, but the script seemed like a cringe worthy 2013 script. Battle was solid. Excited for Frieza vs Megatron though. Audibly shouted with joy when seeing the match up.
The Hero v. The Plague!  I'll be honest, I expected our man Cole to lose, since his good ending was the canon. Glad to see him get the win.
Starkiller vs darth vader
5:29 *REFERENCE OF INFAMOUS SECOND SON*
Not gonna lie was rotting for alex all the way till the end but can't deny the facts you guys put forth that in a head on battle cole is the likely winner... Of course I kinda doubt alex would actually die in battle just because his body was disintegrated doesn't mean all of it was he is not a person after all but the blacklight virus I find it very possible that he can simply be reborn if not absorbed like in the case with james heller of course im not entirely sure since I don't recall seeing something like that but it's something I imagine is possible.
The relief I felt when _____ won was astounding. Looking forward to next time!
2:12 Don't say muffin button
I was expecting kaneki vs alex mercer but this is ok
The instant they revealed Cole wiped out the conduit genes across the world, i knew Alex was probably toast.
15:18 Nah Imma do my own thing
Ohh you better be using LittleKuriboh for Frieza. The best second only to Ayers, may he rest in peace.
Katana (DC) vs Kitana (MK)
Nahh man  Alex should have one
I think Frieza just eats Megatron
8:41  "Good thing I didn't save for retirement."  Amazing, I'd never heard that one before.
This could go either way but i can see how cole could win. But Alex not using s devastator is crazy. Also he could've infected the population and had help. Also they said cole could resist the blacklight virus but also said that he was vulnerable to possible corruption. Which is it? Also cole has never survived being stabbed through the chest. Once alex did that the consumption would've taken over. Idk, i played both games like 12 times each and its close but i give the edge to Alex🤷🏿‍♂️
If they say megatron beats frieza like i know they will, i’m uninstalling the internet
HOO BOY A "Well, that happened" AND A "He's right behind me isn't he?" IN THE SAME EPISODE also no, Cole absorbs bioelectricity, he couldn't just straight up absorb Alex as a whole whereas Alex should be able to do just that I see why this one didn't see the light of day for so long
Captain America vs Albert wesker
pwnd, awesome sauce....and a DBZA reference....definitely a 2013 script and I am here for it
Crazy how they lowballed Cole and he still won, his multi conti Scaling isn’t even neeeded. W DB.
Vilgax (ben 10) vs megatron (transformers) would have been a much better and a more fair matchup then what were getting next. Not to mention these two characters have a lot of things common, such as the same desires, personality, and powers.
9:50  What's confusing?  Taking memories is a core part of the entire game.  Which then turned into a really interesting Ship of Theseus question.  Of course the virus would steal sentience at level 0 of it's life cycle.
Next battle, the size difference alone will even this fight a little bit
Cole is the definition of an electric charged super being that saved the world. He did Alex’s goal before Alex even got close. He’s a hero and the savior of New Marias for a reason. Alex is awesome but Cole has his priorities right.
This by far was the best battle between two of the greatest characters but the next battle is going to be more crazier
Half expected  Shadow the Hedgehog to arrive half way through and curb stomp both of them.
I'm a huge fan of both, but I gotta look at reality. Megatron gonna get railed by Black Frieza! (metaphorically of course)
Maybe they’ll have Delsin Rowe next?
Now we need a DELSIN ROWE battle!
Considering that this arguements was ten years old, it doesn't surprise me that Death Battle reached the same conclusion as 70ish percent of the YouTube analysis videos that said the same thing. Hell, I didn't even know that the Ray Sphere rebuilt everyone it made into Conduits on the atomic level, and I still said Cole would win based on power output and the Blacklight Virus'/Mercer's weakness to fire and electrical damage.
Sweet!! My favorite old time video game protagonist won!!!  🌩 ⚡️ 🌩 ⚡️
I love that this video got the rare opportunity to have a motivation for the competitors to fight rather than having to fight because they’re in deathbattle
Did anyone else look at friend vs Megatron and thought really
Gyver vs spawn which is the better bio armor
Alright well, I was rooting for Alex but since we can't get that win, I wanna see a heller vs delsin fight, bring a round two with all new powers and abilities
good  now do The Iron Giant vs. The Big O
i am disappointed
Wait so how powerful is Megatron? Cause as far as I'm aware he's like country level or something and they wouldn't pit him up against Frieza if he's country level
who else is waiting for a BaKi vs ohma tokita (BAKI VS KENSHIN ASURA)death battle? 🤔
I would never have expected this Death Battle episode, but this is an awesome surprise  Very nostalgic
Spawn vs Alucard( ultimate hellsing)
Spoilers:     The moment that it pointed out that Cole could absorb bio electricity it was over. Technically, he could have just drained all the energy out of his cells until they all died. This was actually a stomp, no diff.
Is it gona be manga frieza or anime frieza in Frieza vs Megatron?
Alex shoulda won
YES! FINALLY! A CHARACTER I LIKE MORE WINS IN A DEATH BATTLE!
Sounds like my ex wife
Well…I think I know who’s winning the next death battle.
Frieza vs Megatron.. huh… Someone who has knowledge of both series explain who wins this.
Doomguy needs to be given another shot
So wait they knew that this would be a thing lmfao and I was like huh I thought  this already happened
18:30 really, we all know who gonna win
Idk how tf Cole is supposed to beat Alex but this'll be interesting.
16:23, MacGrath parents will soo proud of you (Cole).👏👏☺
Ngl, I was pleasantly surprised that Cole won since the majority of my favorite characters end up losing.
Why do they keep making the script sound terrible, aside from awesome sauce this is the most fun analysis I’ve seen in quite a while. Also wiz said “that’s right boom stick.” Peak death battle analysis.
Finaly LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
Dam Cole was just on another level.
I think an issue with Mercer is that he doesn't have enough lore feats. The only impressive thing in cutscene is the nuke scene from prototype 1, but he is far stronger in prototype 2 and even absorbs 8 evolved leading up to the final fight. Point is Alex needed more opportunities in game to show feats.
An ancient dual, come to light...
My faith is rewarded. Hurrah for Cole!!  Also spoilers: wait a minute... WHICH Megatron? Understand that there is multiple, and not all of them are the same, at least personality wise. G1 is the good old fashioned tyrant that seeks conquest and power. However Cybertron Megatron is the closest ever possible to Frieza's personality and power scaling, where he is hell bent on conquering the universe and/or destroying it. This specific Megatron is downright evil and power hungry, and with the Armor of Unicron he is near invincible.
L
😂 Damn Alex lost twice
0/10  no funny Cole scream
Man who wrote this script, Disney?
You guys should do Witchblade vs Issei Hyoudou!
Infamous 3 vs Prototype 2
I have been waiting so long for this
This death battle has been a long time coming. It was well worth the wait. RIP to the people who didn't get to see this masterpiece.
Like how people get to vote now
Looks like the Electrifying Cole MacGrath is much more Badass and Powerful than the Mutated Alex Mercer
I'am happy that Cole won because I was rooting for Bill in previous episode and I need to clear my karma.
Epic!
Honestly, the outcome took me by surprise.
Megatron VS  Freeza  seriously  Megatron has no chance Freeza  won't even have to transform to defeat him
I have played neither games and yet this was the most invested I've been in many battles!
MEGATRON VS FRIEZA GONNA BE OFF THE HOOK!
"Awesome sauce" is almost as cringe as ""nothing-burger".
Ok guys help me out here. What chance at all does megaton have against frieza?
Frieza vs Megatron seems very random.
For the sake of the world I’m glad these were the results 😂
My friends and I had this very discussion back when these games first came out. Good to know I was right, lol. Thanks for the video!
This feels weird since this is apparently one of the most requested matchups in Death Battle history, but this was probably the episode that had me the least hyped in quite a while. I only know Cole through pop culture osmosis, and I have literally never heard of Alex. Oh well, that's just me, and we did just get Bill vs Discord the episode prior so I shouldn't have any complaints. Hella pumped for the next match up though! I really should watch one of the Transformers series to see how Megatron stacks up, I've been meaning too for a long while!
Nah, I know damn well y’all mfs didn’t just hoed Alex Mercer like this🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Cant wait for these guys to Do Rick Taylor from splatter house fight someone
DAMMIT!!! Still not Kamen Rider vs Captain America 😠
My two favorite video games fighting 😅
i waited 10 years for this glorious moment
Valid
Love this. Really wanted Cole to win, but last year when this was announced I decided to check out Prototype and thought it was hopeless, yet here we are
Basically a Sans vs Betty Noire fight, haha glitchtale memes. 😂
When you really think about it, the Beast from Infamous is really just a slightly nerfed Dr. Manhattan. He just doesn’t see the future.
You know the way they talk about this match, sounds like they didn’t even want it this to happen in the first place, boom stick. Sounds like he’s been forced to do homework because his  mom told her to
Freiza vs megatron is dumb
Cole might have won but Alex is still cooler.
8:41  "Good thing I didn't save for retirement."  Amazing, I'd never heard that one before.
This made my sarkicism blood boil... I really thought Ion would be reborn 😢:
I’m sorry but frieza vs megatron sounds dumb why is that even a matchup
Are you kidding me? Current magna Frieza blitzed MUI Goku and Ultra Ego Vegeta that got Zenkai boosts from the Granola arc AT THE SAME TIME. He's comparable to Beast Gohan if not stronger. Megatron is going to get utterly obliterated unless they pull another Goku vs Superman.
The result... the result makes me happy.
Great death battle. I just had no idea who these guys were
Dr. Manhattam vs. Franklin Richards.
gods i miss infamous 1&2, they really need a PS5 remake!!!
I, uh, don’t think Megatron even comes close to comparing to Frieza. At least, last I checked.
Parasite Eve did it better than Mercer did.
That was sick
Idk why people keep excluding the fact that the beast destroyed the moon
Can you guys do Zangief vs king street fighter vs tekken
It's a good thing Cole didn't challenge Alex to a parkour race; Alex would have crossed the line before Cole hopscotched his way up the first building
This is fitting enough to have a crossover game with these two
frieza has to be ridiculously above megatron  but I hope it's a good fight
Been waiting for this fight for ages 😢
That fight was intense. I felt scared for Cole a little bit until he survived being stabbed in the chest 😅
It's great that Cole won.
5:38 what happened to blue apron?
I also would like to see Evil Cole attempt this Death Battle.  Maybe with Vampire powers, in addition to the fire powers.
................and then Alex took over Cole's body...its not like Cole knew about the virus. Also since when can Cole survive getting pierced through his chest?
Sly Cooper vs Secret Squirrel!! DAY 1
I love both transformers and dragon ball but the next fight is going to end badly
SPOILER     I see Frieza winning the next one, he is just way to powerful, at gold he could nearly handle Goku's SSGSS form.
13:40 - like shadow the hedge hog!
Please do transformers bumblebee vs dc bumblebee.
It be dope to watch Beta Ray Bill from Marvel or Supreme from Image comics versus Thragg or BattleBeast from Invincible
....is the next fight a joke? I don't think I've seen a bigger stomp match.
the music went perfectly with the fight
DAMN. I did not see that ending coming.
they nerfed alex into the dirt who scaled that man 💀
Isn’t the bad end to infamous 2 confirmed from the beginning of infamous second son?
Is a Transformer like Megatron really comparable to a DB character like Frieza??
It's weird people wanted Alex Mercer to fight cole and not Albert Wesker
Wait Frieza VS Megatron!?.... What kind of stuff does Megatron have that could even make this match fair? Note I'm a transformers fan and I'm asking this
Okay I'm sorry... Im just here to check out who's up next. Why... especially with the manga, would they put Frieza up against Megatron.... Even tho he's more powerful than starscream, I don't see him doing anything to Black Frieza?
Prototype was SO much better than Infamous, I don't understand how that franchise only got two entries.
I love both dragon ball and transformers but megatron vs Frieza isn't a fair fight
Writing comment before watching I like Cole more but I'm thinking Alex is more op so I'm calling Alex mid to high diff. Edit: LFG COLE
I already had my Death Battle wish. Broly vs. Hulk. I'm happy. =)
11:08 currently still watching but listening to the data sounds Alex will win this
So you mean to tell me you guys deliberately just don't do the matches people want? And you even had this match in the works but just didn't?   Buggin' fr Death Battle.
Frieza vs Megatron?? REALLY? I love Transformers more than DBZ, but really, Megs has like NO chance against Frieza, unless they pull some nonsense from an obscure comic with questionable canon and take it out of context (like the Matrix's destructive output. It blew up Unicron because it was basically Unicron's Kryptonite, not because it's a pocket-sized nuke.)
Frieza all the way🔥🔥🔥
Finally the machine will go down... then again Frieza almost never wins
Gotta get a battle with yujiro hanma
18:29 I'm so sorry for you, Nem
how predictable you are
See at first I never played prototype but my cousin was well vested in and he told me that Alex Mercer has a crazy healing factor and could rewrite somebody’s dna which sounded crazy to me. But then when u guys said his atoms were basically electricity then i forgot what the ray sphere actually did to coke and I was wondering why he didn’t pull the beasts power out but it was only cause u guys used a seperate coke McGrath which makes tbh. But I just didn’t think coke could output a power high enough to stop his regeneration
You guys should do power from chainsaw man  Vs Nezuko from demon slayer They are perfect for each other as they both are blood powered creatures
Who will win death battle Cole MacGrath  or alex mercer
Nice characters
Cole won his mirror match and Alex didn't kinda ironic.
Nice, but Frieza versus Megatron isn't even a fight. That is so very, very one sided.
Ok this fight was badass and the music was incredible.   But i musy say in all the time that i have been watching death battle would have never expected to see frieza vs megatron
Thats right Boomstick!
Can we take a moment to appreciate how well choreographed this fight was , cheers Death Battle 👍
Cole is low key one of my favorite video game heroes. I was so stoked when he turned Mercer’s consume back around on him. Plus I love the way he was written in this, especially that ending line.  Might be an old script, but it was written with love for the source material. Really appreciated as an Infamous fan.
Doom guy vs kratos that’s my idea
Ones a nuke proof all consuming virus that can remake itself from a single cell, the other is a man whos cononically been hospitalised by bullets and water, guess who won?
This one took forever
The next time battle got me busting
Freeza vs Megatron which would be more racist?
Thank you so much death battle
Pain vs Cooler
Am I the only one hoping for shadow from the eminence in shadow vs Reinhard Van Astrea from re zero they are both master swordsmen with incredible magical abilities
I like to think in he Evil Ending, Cole becomes Keslar again, and goes back to help the past him like a loop. While in the Good Ending, Cole actually survives, at the end when the boat is carrying away, we see the lightning bolt strike in it's direction and know for a fact the gene isn't gone for good, so perhaps that bolt revived him and he went into hiding to live a less... extreme life, pretty easy to do with the world basically thinking you're dead
I do wanna see Delsin Rowe against someone in these death battles at some point
18:31 Frieza vs Megatron didn't expect that to happen but why do I feel like Megatron would win this fight!?
Ya know, when you brought up the Black Tar thing, that kind of spelled it out for me who was winning. Loved the fight animation though, it's not often enough you see such wildly different power sets going at it in this show.  As for next time.... I am not up on my Transformers Lore, are we entirely certain that this is a fair match up?
i really thought mercer had the biggest advantage
Megatron vs freeza that doesn’t seem fair for megaton and least
Whenever a character with broken regeneration ability was killed in this show. Examples are wolverine and carnage.
Bro i just got prototype and started playing it like an hour ago, got to thinking "I wonder if theres a death battle with this Alex Mercer guy. He seems pretty cool." And now i open my phone and see this.
could you do saitama vs goku?? please, to resolve the discussion, and the incredible animation of course
PLEASE do Majima vs Juri, the culture needs
Pickle (baki) vs kraven the hunter (dc comics)
How is the next deathbattle even a challenge?
bro i thought the guy on the right in the thumbnail was eminem🤣🤣🤣🤣
If you watched One Piece, you knew this fight was over before it started.
It's been way too long since we last had a banger of a 3D fight
The wait was worth it!
Actually one of my all time childhood dream matchups!! WAAAY TOO COOL MAN! WAY TOO COOL!
Muffin button.
Mercer couldn't face Cole's MacWrath
Alex's abilities didn't seem as impressive to me as Cole's, so I had a pretty good idea of who was going to win this one.
May i redirect you to the "Biomass effect" fanfiction if your feeeling robbed right now like i am. Lets all go read about alex and all of humanity becoming an omnipotent eldritch god.
Love that nod to Delsin at the end of Cole’s rundown. Second Son was among my first PS4 games I ever played. Ahh, good times…
Wonder how a deathstroke vs Captain America would go
Spoilers          One of the best 3d episodes in death battle histroy you guys did a fantastic job on the vas the world has been perfectly remade oh my god the camera work was phenomenal cole grinding on alexes tentacle attack that was so good the eefects were all amazing ngl the onyl problem i had was the death it kinda came outa nowhere and a bit more of a back and forwards would make it feel more tence also one of the best DB raps it fit the style of both games fantasticly and alex getting his armor i hope he used that a bit more but that looked great i loved how much cloes lighting standed out in the red and orange world / back ground rlly showing the difference between the two such a fantastic outing by the hole team
My 2 favorite games that deserve 3rd games.
Jax(Mortal Kombat) Vs Cyborg (DC)
Probably not a good idea to say: “Let’s end this debate once and for all.”
Rimuru tempest ( true dragon evolution ) vs one punch man
I am incredibly biased towards Alex since I played prototype as a kid and watched my brother play it too but I understand why Cole won. I'll just have to deal with it 😔
I hope Sony sees this death battle because it will show their been neglecting the Dormant infamous franchise and see that fans really want a new Infamous game also not just infamous but other dormant games.  Examples.  Sly Cooper   Knack   Jak and Daxter   Prototype  Spyro the dragon  This really was an Awesome match up for this season and I hope this battle shows an example for dormant games that should be Recognize and back on the big screen also have their fair share to Continue their stories.
Now I want Alex Mercer vs Alucard
Prototype was probably one of the most fun games ever. Just cause carnage everywhere 😂
Now I do want to see Alex in another one where he dose win
I want to see a proper Xenenort vs Palpatine. I know they did a DBX but still. Also a proper kid Goku vs Gon.
I'm fine with the results however, I feel they didn't use the experience the loser gained.
Oh I am so hyped for Megatron to finally be on Death Battle!
Activated conduits are immune to diseases, which is why the plaque never affected Cole, so the blacklight virus would most likely have no effect on him.
Great now that we've established the combatants don't have to be relevant, that qualifies Guyver! lol
Hoodiecard looks edgier. Same for Mr Clean. They look...zappier.
I just don't like frieza vs megatron.      Just doesn't look good to me. . . Knowing megatron is gonna win
16:43 what are you guys even saying. Talking molecular DNA vs atomic what are you guys even saying. Words are just being thrown out here without understanding what youre talking about or saying
Nice, I still have my infamous 2 backpack. Cool to see him again even if it's a death battle.
Really thought Alex was going to win.  Oh well, I still loved this fight.  👍🏻
Honestly, this episode was way more awesome than it has any right to be.
Mercer with ease
As a 2009 guy who saw side by side trailers to both games around the same time, this is giving serious Prototype nostalgia.   Sadly I have to vote against my main and give it to Cole.
Neat touch: they say the script was from 2013.  When it's time for the battle, Wiz uses the line "end the debate once and for all" like they did in the early seasons as opposed to "run the data through all possibilities" as he does in later seasons.
Genuinely surprised. I thought this was going to be a blowout for Prototype boy, but I’ve never played any of the games, so I was just going based on their reputation. (And also Zero Punctuations comparison video that made it seem like Alex was way stronger, but to be fair, Infamous 2 hadn’t come out yet…)
If they are Gonna Look at old Requests Ive been Asking For Dante Vs Alucard for as Long as i can Remember! Hopefully they do it maaaan
So much screaming...  Thanks YET AGAIN to Rooster Teeth and DB for having me back and letting me just...scream a bunch.
I'm not sure why they're mocking either of them for 'relevancy,' this show picks obscure stuff all the time.
This episode will get a million bajillion views
I'm sorry Frieza vs Megatron ooookay
Honestly, when I saw you guys chose Hero Cole I thought what a deliberate decision to use his weaker version. Glad you guys did bring up that there was really no need to use Beast Cole for this fight.
For once, I'd like to see an edgy character done right in more media rather than keep seeing Shadow the Hedgehog copycats.
Shulk from Xenoblade Chronicles vs Erin Yeager from Attack on Titan  It sounds random at first, but the more you start thinking about it, the more you see the parallels in those two.   Both are trapped in a small place at the start of their stories just waiting to be slaughtered, wanting nothing more than to break down the walls to find something greater and save humanity. They both inherit these godlike abilities/weapons to destroy these massive previously undefeatable foes.  Both can see into the future, but while one of them changes the future, the other is bound to its inevitability.  By the end for them, Shulk could wipe out a man capable of destroying his world with the help of two titans and Erin could destroy all of humanity... singlehandedly
So it basically came down who can eat who faster, and Cole was the bigger eater.
I was rooting for Alex but when Cole won, I was a little shocked.
Infamous vs second sun Next?
Boomstick is me reading stories I wrote 13 years ago.  Still a good match but maybe re-write stuff that old.  Rooting for Cole.
FREIZA VS MEGATRON!!!! ITS FINALLY HAPPENING!!!!!
Freeza vs pyron is a much better matchup then megatron
This episode was METAL 🤟🏾
I want to see Ruvik From Evilwithin in death Battle
They even said "Let's end this debate once and for all." They're really trying to take us back to the past.
tick vs red chin 1985
ryu hayabusa(razor edge 3)vs kenshi
Well, this was... shocking. Pretty cool
The animation could've been better but still good fight
For year's I've been waiting for this and they delivered it...   But my question remains unanswered and that question is "How tf does Cole take a shower when he can't be in contact with water?"
Ben 10 vs Danny phantom
So, next Battle is an auto-win for Frieza. Don't know why they're bothering with that, no WAY can Megatron beat him.
Did I just see Megatron versus freezer? Yeah that’s going to be awesome.
Feels off how they feel this matchup is mocked while older less timeless characters were somehow okay, especially with this getting fan voted.
Hehe, the poor fools who thinks Megatron has a chance in the next death battle. (But Megatron was granted a power boost from Unicron) I hear you saying. Uh, Frieza casually blows up planets in his base form. Black Frieza is going to annihilate Megatron no-diff.
Well I think I know who is winning the next fight. One shall rise the other shall fall, and this time it will be nothing like the movie.
Common death battle L
4:21 boomstick clone got blown up
frieza vs megatron?! as a fan of both franchises transformers and dragon ball... VERY UNFAIR match frieza destroys megatron bcs frieza is low multiversal and even multiversal possibly with his golden form in canon while megatron in G1 cannon is just multi-contental, unless they use the alternity version of megatron which at its true form is multiversal
That’s funny, they held off on this because they already knew the answer. Nice.
Bro Cole really earned this W
Cole and Alex: *breath* Wiz and Boomstick: JUST LIKE SHADOW THE HEDGEHOG!
been waiting years for this
Frieza vs Megatron?    Is this a joke?     Megatron even at his strongest (Galvatron?) was at most a city killer...Frieza was well and capable of destroying planets...in his First Form.     By the time you get to "Black Frieza" in super the scaling is just ludicrous.
The Ultimate Clash we have been waiting for.
Lol, neither of these guys have been relevant for years, and had a strange rivalry at the time... and you know what, I coudlnt possibly be happier!
Yeah!!!!!!!!!! That's my boy, Cole!
13:33  music?
That's my fav death battle now
I've actually played these two games on my PS3 and they're hella fun I never thought someone would actually put them to death battle
God yes I've been waiting for this fight since I was 12!
I didn’t see this ending coming.  I’m a fan of both games and think infamous and Cole are the better game and character but with Mercers stealth abilities combined with with the ability to consume people I thought this would end by assimilation.  Granted I forgot Cole did have a way to track Alex
Finn the human vs who?????
This fight was awesome but I still think Alex Mercer VS Carnage or Anti-Venom would've been a cooler fight. Similar power-sets, they should be matched blow for blow, and the fight would end in a similar matter in that the deciding factor is who can devour whom first. Hell, Anti-Venom's whole purpose is curing diseases and genetic mutations, so he could be a prime antagonist to Mercer
I agree Cole is stronger, but I'm not happy with how unimaginative they were with Alex's power. They mentioned Alex's ability to mind control and shapeshifting then don't let him use them. Alex could've used the civilians that were there as pawns to distract Cole with attacks and confuse him by hiding in a crowd for a sneak attack. Cole being a hero means he won't just randomly attack civilians. Alex's major advantage is experience and knowledge. He's assimilated some of the best scientists, soldiers, and military commanders in his world. Because of this he's an expert tactician and fighter. In this Alex was nothing more than a mindless beast with no strategy or intelligence. I agree Alex would most likely lose but they did him dirty in this fight.
Two parts of mag hank. Fun.
Holy smokes  finally
This animation looked better than the original games.
Unless a Galvaron transformation or, i don't know some power from Megatronus comes into play, i don't see how Megs is going to win.
Was I the only one who felt a bit. Underwhelmed by this? No hate to the team but like. The analysis kinda felt too reliant on memes and references and it didnt make me wanna check out the games. I kinda felt like they didnt like the infamous or prototype games. It kinda felt like they hated them . Specially infamous . The fight was honestly kinda boring to me. And with them not explaining alex’s forms i was kinda confused when his form changes outta nowhere. Final line from cole was good though. Also CMON FREEZA VS MEGATRON?! Theres alot better matchups for them
Considering how both franchises are more dead than…well Cole and Alex. Its nice to see them get mentioned at all which is beautiful
Next time: Megatron vs Frieza  Well Megatrons gonna die
New favorite DB of all time
Crazy match!! Now that luffys 5th gear has shown itself, put luffy in a death battle next and hopefully make him win and hopefully Brandon Yates can do the theme. This latest theme is sick.
THERE IS NO MUFFIN BUTTON!!!  Then where did I get this Muffin?
Now I wonder how long will it take for them to make Saitama Vs Goku
Honestly this is one of the few fights where people are just happy these characters were finally used for once
now that i think of it can vergil from static shock handle cole macgrath?
How long until we get Goku VS Superman 3 please
Genuinely S-tier episode, up there with Sam vs Snake and Balrog vs TJ, absolutely worth the wait and hype, thank you for delivering!
Let’s hope next death battle  for after frizea vs megatron is kamen rider ichigo vs caption America.  The first avenger vs the first rider
18:20
Maybe not the best pick but I think Jason Statham could have played a pretty good live action Cole
LETS GOOOOO! COLE MY BOI I LOVE YOU!
I like a good, straightforward slugfest between two evenly-skilled fighters.
Disappointed that Alex lost but tbh the fight was EPIC and well worth the decade long wait.
Anyone else have nostalgic flashbacks when they seen the gameplay for both Cole and Alex...ah simpler times indeed
My money on Frieza
So Frieza is going to dogwalk Megatron, right? Like, I don't see how Megatron can compare.
Probably Starscream next episode: “ Megatron has fallen, I, Starscream am now your leader.”
In unfamiliar with the game but yeah, that guy looks like a Cole.
Who's Next?
COLE WON WTF!?! THAT'S AWESOME
It would be nice to see (vision vs Martian man hunter).
Put luffy in a death battle please
And unless megatron has some really powerful feats in the comics there’s no way he can win
Been wanting this matchup for years
I've waited for a long time for this, InFamous vs Prototype is now on Death Battle it's been a few years to find Cole MacGrath vs Alex Mercer, And Here they are!
Wow. That didn't end quite like i expected. Not an unwelcome turn of events. Next we got Frieza vs Megatron. Ok. Which Megatron tho?
This doesn't make sense Alex should have adapted to Cole's lightning after the 3rd or 4th hit.
James Heller jumping in from the top rope: "Kill-stealing bastard!"
So, we're getting Frieza vs. Megatron? Frieza wins, hands down.  I mean, this is a guy that destroyed Planets Vegeta, Namek, & Earth (though, it was rewound), and he even held his own in the Tournament of Power at the end, while dead. Megatron has no chance against Golden Frieza. ...unless he has an ace in his hole.  Also, here's hoping TFS's Frieza is featured in it, too.
Dammit wanted alex to win
You guys have no idea how many YEARS I've been waiting for this match up.
It took 14 years since both games first came out for this battle, but it was well worth it.
How is Frieza going to defeat megatron and his dark energon
So, now we do evil cole vs starkiller yeah
Now do Lord Voldemort vs Orochimaru!  2 snake themed prodigies that seek to obtain immortality for purpose of pushing their chosen arts to the absolute limits.
Now i really wanna play infamous. This was such a good episode and ive never played or even heard of either of these two before watching this episode
YES YES YES YES YYYEEEEESSSSS i've been waiting for over a dozen years to see this outcome battle was a little meh but still so good
Being a prototype fan really sucks
This wasn't a fight about power but the drip
Well looks like old Bucket heads gonna die
Now here comes the alex mercer A tier D riders after seeing their favorite character lost
Remember, this matchup is one of the most important reasons why Carnage fought Lucy from Elfen Lied back in Season 5.
💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾COLE GANG
I never thought I'd see the day
you should do James heller with someone
Megatron vs Freiza up next? As much of a transformers fan as I am, there’s no chance he’s got surviving this
Take a shot every time Boomstick mentions Shadow the Hedgehog.
FRIEZA VS MEGATRON?!?! OH HELL YEAH!!!!
Okay be frank guys I know it was the early 2000's but is the writing in these games good? This seem like the writing was  made by an edgy teenager who trying compensate for something
Sometimes I feel like I would have preferred them to just tell us that there was no chance than have the battle. If the virus monster can’t infect the target he’s doesn’t really have anything else up his sleeve. If that was the interpretation y’all were gonna go for it kind of invalidates the fight. This kind of reminds me of chrona vs venom. Crona uses sound based attacks and venom is weak to specially sound and fire, so what was the point of the fight? Same thing here. Cool to watch and all, but that reasoning kinda invalidated the entire fight.
FRIEZA VS MEGATRON FRIEZA VS MEGATRON FRIEZA VS MEGATRON
Imagine if Cole was a clone of Kessler, that would make his character arc look so much better. Still Alex’s is quite the intriguing one, indeed.
You guys are better than having a gun shoot the entire round
Oh no, if Freiza loses then we have indisputable proof that Madara gets bodied by the Transformers.
Next -Frieza vs Megatron
Ben 10 Vs you gi oh battle of watches
15 year old me is going nuts right now
Taking powers huh? Thanks for the tip
The Nostalgia is coming back!❤
Accelerator Vs. Tomura Shigoraki (MHA)  Spider-Man Vs. Deku
Bro just seeing Cole again was awesome. Miss the guy.
epicas batallas del rap del frikismo se volvio real
Freiza!!!! Black freiza!!!
Speaking of the second version of these games who would win in that fight
Freeza vs megatron won’t be close
Should i be excited for next time?
spongebob vs gambie
Alex wins
Please do iron man VS war machine
Ryoko vs yoruichi
spider man vs miraculous
I am pleasantly surprised. I thought Alex had this but im glad Cole won. As for the next battle, pretty one sided...
Megatron stomps.
L song wtf
Megatron vs dark vader
Alex Mercer is the personification of all Linkin Park's Edgy songs!
Alex got the Cole shoulder
The Prototype games were great
Pls do Spawn vs Hellboy. 🔥
FRIEZA VS MEGATRON?!
I was expecting Alex to win, not because I love him, I think they're both awesome.  In my opinion Alex's powers are one of the most OP for a video game protag.  But can't argue against results.
Suggestion for a halloween episode. Pinhead (Hellraiser) vs The Tall Man (Phantasm)  That could be an awesome match. 🙂
I wonder how they’ll deal with Black Frieza. He showed up, one shot MUI Goku and Ultra Ego Vegeta, then left, and hasn’t been seen since.
Storm shadow vs lady shiva
How About a fight with Doom Slayer vs Kratos
The Fight Starts Now 12:57
Its funny I have the second version of both games😂
It was about damn time!
Riddick vs jango fett
Frieza vs megatron? REALLY? 💀
Cole is the hero and Alex is the monster, that's why Cole wins, Alex lose
Cole can heal with his power, too. Not just suck someone's life force
This fight was... just about perfect. Especially if you were a fan of inFamous or [PROTOTYPE]. The rivalry goes full circle, and the fight scene really felt like a mortal struggle between both combatants. I may not have played either of these games, but I must admit that was really epic. What a satisfying conclusion to such a long, heated video game rivalry.
18:30 Uhhhh….I don’t watch transformers much in cartoon history,but or DBZ. But that’s not a fair fight in Death Battle.🌌📺🤨🤔
MUFFIN BUTTON
13:21 FIGHT!!!!!!!!!!⚡⚡⚡VS🗡️🗡️🗡️💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
Perhaps waiting so long to do this one was a blessing in disguise. Now they've got the budget and experience to make it the spectacle it needed to be.  Rare for one of these fights to have such a clear idealism VS cynicism angle in the narrative. It's kinda neat.
Pretty accurate. I like Alex much more than Cole but I see how he won and it was a good fight. Unlike James Heller vs Alex, this doesn't bother me because here Alex wasn't holding back like he did with Heller
This is my childhood relived. I love this!
THIS DOES NOT COUNT😡😡💢💢💢❗❗❗
Cole didn't vaporize the Beast. The RFI did. And doing so killed Cole
So does this mean we're finally getting Infamous 3 😢
Awesome video but  I like to know will death battle do a fight with a touhou project character in it?
People keep saying this was one of the most requested matchups and I'm over here not knowing either one of these two and skipping to the end to see who the next death battle will be
I hit pause to write this:  HOW Y'ALL GONNA JUST MENTON THE MUFFIN BUTTO LIKE IT WAS NO BIG DEAL???
Fun fact: This is the first non playstation vs playstation character to where a playstation character win in a death battle
Just remember he was the Demon of Empire City, but he is the Patron Saint of New Marais.
Man I’m just happy to see Alex Mercer being a badass again after all these years 🥲
18:22 those two fighting makes absolute sense they are so similar they both kill their own men often XD
I just wanna say I like both characters and games but I think think that little electric slam would kill Alex given how it didn’t have the blast radius or power of a nuke and this is good cole who is weaker than his evil self and I don’t think he could survive the virus cause wasn’t the beast thing didn’t it only target people with the conduit gene or without it while the virus is something else entirely
Jesus a 10 year old script for a match we've wanted way longer😂
One of the best matches i watched after Bayonetta VS Dante
Should have had him use his lightning strike.
COLE MACGRATH FANS ARE EATING
A few years behind the others about Megatron vs Frieza lets see how they'll have this fight go. Compared to creators who did this a few years back
Haven't seen the episode yet but like, hypothetically if Alex ate Cole, since the conduit powers are from a gene and all, he could have all of Cole's abilities?
Megatron vs Frieza should be an interesting match-up. Never thought of them before.
He remind me about static shock.
Request for Hayato Fūrinji" The invisible superman" from Histories strongest disciple kenichi vs. Yujiro Hanna"The orge" from Baki.
It’s SO nice to see Cole get respect again :)
Pre match prediction, Cole stomps Alex once got taking out by a tazer
(spoilers)            My hats off to you Cole, you single handedly ended the blacklight virus.  Also Megatron versus Frieza? I never would have expected that fight!
awesome sauce episoe, worth waiting 12 years for it
I dont know a thing about either of these characters, but knowing how long the DB community's wanted this, I'd say the episode delivered. I enjoyed it more than I anticipated
This Death Battle was amazing! I didn’t know much about either either character, but I really enjoyed it. Also that next time…that was also a highly requested matchup.  From what I heard, this might be another Vegeta vs Thor where Megatron stomps Frieza…
For next death battle could you please do Joel from The last of us VS Decon st. John from Days gone
Why did it take yall so long I asked for this like 10 years ago
Another great death battle
That was way too fast
Awesome deathbattle. I really didn't know who would win, and while I can see how they came to that, it's probably to be one of those debated dbs for a while. As for the next one, I was shocked to see its going to be Frieza vs Megatron, one I've been wanting to see them do. Now this is actually trickier than one thinks. It really depends on the versions they use (like if they do one specific megatron or a composite and/or if they include Heroes feats for Frieza). Frieza probably wins most outcomes, but there are versions of Megatron that could kill Frieza. First of all, most, if not all versions, of Megatron at his base power are capable of surviving planet busting attacks (One time he took multiple hits of said strength from Unicron, the literal transformers devil), so he can hold his own against Frieza and maybe Golden Frieza. There are versions of Megatron that use darkmatter or dark energon that kill organics, which could bypass Frieza's durability. And if we include his stronger forms like Galvatron, then it gets trickier.  And if they use Alternity Megatron's ultimate form, then its a clear stomp for Megatron because at that point, Megs is a multiversal destroyer.
Frieza Vs Megatron this is going to be good.
How have you guys not done plastic man vs mr fantastic?? Only thing I could see this coming down to would be street Smart versus raw intelligence
Ok i admittedly don't know much about megatron but i'd bet good money on the planet buster that can go 1v1 with Super Saiyan Blue Goku.
Finally transformers comes back to deathbattle. With the antimatter transformers can now harm and kill gods. Megatron is now multiversal plus. R.i.p friezia
Death battle be coming out with banger after banger
Frieza vs megatron
I chose Cole MacGrath after I looked up the difference between megatons and kilotons. And I'll be honest, I was not disappointed with the fight or it's result. I heard someone else say that Bill Cipher vs Discord would be a tough act to follow, but Cole vs Alex definitely succeeded on it's own merit in my opinion. And as always, I can't wait for the of the next battle!  Though this now opens up a couple of questions for me: 1). Out of all the symbols left on the wheel, which one would stand for Cole vs. Alex (it could probably be either the beaker or the scales), and 2). What symbol would stand for Freiza vs. Megatron?
Tahu from BIONICLE vs Optimus Prime from TRANSFORMERS
One of the greatest death battles ever made on the channel, I can only hope Frieza vs Megatron is done correctly.
MEGATRON VS FRIEZA IS ON MY BIRTHDAY!!!!  🎉🎉🎉🎉
Definitely worth the wait.  This makes me want Cole MacGrath VS Virgil Hawkins(Static) so much.
This fight feels like an edgy 2000s superhero flick complete with the villain goading the hero to join them.
As for next time… huh.  I guess this is the first time we have had such a size difference between fighters. Best I can recall is either Godzilla vs Gamera, Optimus vs Gundam or Tigerzord vs Epyon. But this definitely will be quite a size difference considering Frieza isn’t exactly the tallest DB character to begin with… still, can’t help but feel the golden-black lord might have an edge, but need to look into Megatron again (but I feel like his chances might not be looking too good in comparison to Frieza).
Good match up idea: the strongest man Lu Bu from Record of Ragnarok vs the strongest creature yujiro hanma from Baki
When is Byakuya gonna fight Itachi?
Bruh Frieza vs Megatron.. sounds like an unfair battle. totally Frieza is going to one shot Megatron easily
Next Kenshi vs Viola (From Bayonetta)
Wait…can megatron even touch freiza?
Frieza vs Megatron...  Really? You could give Megatron every power up available in the Transformer's canon, and it will still be horribly one sided.  Frieza can just laugh Megatron out of existence without even using his Golden form. It's not going to be a fight, it's going to be an embarrassing and humbling ass kicking for Megatron.
All jokes aside this was a good match, the next match not so much, very one sided
Suggestion on fighter: Alita from Alita: Battle Angel movie from 2019. Im aware many didnt like it for one reason or other, but i did liked it hence suggestion
14:11 song sounds Awesome!! Anybody knows the name of the song?
It would have been funny if they did do a mini (<30s) animation where evil cole just looks at Alex and instantly evaporates him or something hahaha
You know what would make a good Death Battle?  A Robin Battle Royale
I'm sure I asked for this years ago
Hey death battles great video, I was wondering/ hoping, if you guys could do any of these death battle matches in the future or next season that would be awesome for this series ?  Ghost faces vs Leather face Arthur Morgan vs Erron Black( Red dead redemption vs Mortal kombat) Captain America vs Soldier boy ( Marvel vs The boys) Rick Grimes vs Jim Hopper ( The walking dead vs Stranger Things) Freddy Kruger vs Pennywise Rambo vs Daryl Dixon Dumbledore vs Gandalf ( Harry Potter vs Lord of the rings) Lee Everett vs Joel Miller ( The walking dead game vs The last of us) Daffy Duck vs Donald Duck  Cat women vs black cat ( Dc vs Marvel) Stick figure battle royale  Tsunade vs Yoriichi ( Naruto vs Bleach) Reaper vs Revenant ( Overwatch vs Apex legends) Abby vs Clementine ( The Last of us vs The walking dead game) Indiana Jones vs Captain Jack Sparrow  Han Solo vs Captain Kirk or Star Lord
Cole : Looking for himself Alex : Looking for himself
Years of waiting for this finally payed off
Are we going to ignore the fact that this fight was ready since 2013
Next Cole MacGrath vs Scar (From Fullmetal Alchemist)
I love how it felt straight out of Season 2-3 with some of the jokes and cutaways.
Can a transformers fan tell me how megatron has ANY chance against freeza? Like freeza fan destroy a planet in a second is he tanking that?
Way to go, Cole!  Also...FRIEZA!? MEGATRON?! YEAH!!!
So that's why we had to vote for it? Because Boomstick mistakenly pitched it in the trash? Because this should've been done as early as Season 3 instead of Tracer vs. Scout. (No offense to that episode) Gotta say, great fight and well worth the wait for it. I mean it doesn't top Bill vs. Discord but that's a tough act to follow in general.  Next Time: Well there you go Friezatron fans. It's finally time to see Megs and possibly Galvs get his servos kicked in and Dragon Ball to get another win. (Seriously how ARE they going to work Galvatron into this? That's less a super form and more just rebuilding and reformatting a machine. Megatron can't just turn into Galvatron by command) I've said it a hundred times already but it seems like ever since Super came out, Dragon Ball's power scaling is completely broken but I'm sure there's some obscure Transformers material Megatron will get as well that helps even the odds.  Requests:  Delsin Rowe (Infamous) vs. Maya the Siren (Borderlands)  Agent Anti-Venom (Marvel) vs. James Heller (Prototype)  Bigby Wolf (Fables) vs. Oogami Shirou (BNA: Brand New Animal)  Squidward (SpongeBob) vs. Benson (Regular Show)  Haseo (Dot Hack) vs. Naofumi (Rise of the Shield Hero)  Bishamon (Darkstalkers) vs. Nagoryuki (Guilty Gear)  Lugia (Pokemon) vs. Mothra (Godzilla)  Baron Rivendare (Warcraft) vs. Hecarim (League of Legends)  Ryuko Matoi (Kill la Kill) vs. Masane Amaha (Witchblade)  Noelle Silva (Black Clover) vs. Lapis Lazuli (Steven Universe)
I love cole and i though he was going to lose because alex is a living virus and has a big healing factor
I knew cole was gonna win
Why’d it take this long for them to make THIS matchup? ☠️
This wouldn't have looked or sounded anywhere near as good if this were made back in 2013. Seriously go back and listen the mic quality was do bad compared to now.
Finally! Let’s gooooo!!!
That song is gonna get stuck in my head and I love it! Great episode!
Me from brazil me fan
One of the absolute hypest death battles for me, as someone who's done over five playthroughs of each Infamous game
Cole MacGrath wins again crime doesn't pay Alex Mercer the winner is Cole MacGrath anyways coming up next Frieza was take on the oppoment Megatron who will win coming October 9th 2023
Loved when cole said: is "coling time" and coled all over alex
This is the battle I didn't know I needed 🥳
After episodes like Black Adam vs Apocalypse and Bill Cipher vs Discord, it feels refreshing to see the good guy defeat the bad guy. When was the last time that happened? Iron Man vs Lex Luthor maybe? Also the next time... poor Nemesis.
"Absorbing your power huh? Thanks for the tip..." 16:55
Biased
U gotta have all the power rangers teams vs against each other
Monkey d luffy vs jack sparrow
The champions are truly awesome I wish I was one
The real winner is Hyperstarman for finally being free from the dreaded Colex curse for so long
I kind of disagree with the Ray Sphere showing how much more durable Cole is. The ray sphere is a device meant to eliminate anyone who doesn’t have a Conduit Gene, while imbuing those that do with power. I don’t think that it much of a contender of a point.
I call bs cause Alex was faster chould take a nuke and chould summon other monsters to fight for him the only used his powers form the first game not the second
Just for the laughs, an idea. Who is the strongest punching bag in anime? Yamcha from dragon ball z, or usopp from one piece?
I am happy with life now 😊
DEATH BATTLE!
The teamfourstar reference was nice
I've been waiting an entire season just for this episode and it was worth the wait. This fight was everything I had hoped for and more. A battle between two superpower beings who embodied cynicism (Alex) and idealism (Good Cole).
Macgrath was just too COLE blooded
I'm happy with the outcome, but I feel they could've made the fight a bit more creative. I was expecting it to end with Alex trying to disguise himself, maybe by eating Zeke, with Cole having to sense Alex out to land the finishing blow. It's one thing to say Alex couldn't hide from him, but they still could've showed that. It's not like Alex would be privy to that info during the fight, there's no reason for him not to try it if he's feeling pressured.
Can't believe Megatron Vs Frieza is gonna come on my Birthday.
I guess we could say The Beast definitely was a much higher threat in comparison to Mercer itself. I still like the Prototype games over Infamous, but part of me figured that the damage output of Cole was going to be a bit too much even when compared to a point-blank nuke.  Either way, this was still a long awaited fight and it is nice to finally see it happen after all this time.
Unexpected huh?
Yo
Chensaw man vs pirâmide head
*Fights in a city.*  *Doesn't let Alex consume people to regenerate his health or use critical mass attacks.*
Ok I like that Cole won, but why did they make him a melee fighter? Cole is mid-long range. His main attack is shock bolts, throws shock grenades, missiles, precision (sniper) shots. Also had shields, and flight. Here it was all melee, including shock fists? He's never made "shock blades" for his hands
I wasn't sure if Cole was going to come out on top, and Alex would dominate, but thank god was I proven wrong. This fight was definitely worth the wait!
An impressive fight!!  I like Alex Mercer more for his skills but I have to say Cole MacGragth is the winner here, it doesn't bother me anyway, I've played Prototype 1 and 2 and the Infamous trilogy and I loved them both and I also love Alex and Cole , both are incredibly powerful, respect.
Please do a vincent valentine death battle. Also a aerith one and a zack fair one
Awesomesauce huh also the loser got consumed
I think the authors of this channel are not on friendly terms
You guys should make a Ghost Rider vs Spawn
And the debate goes on for another ten years. Thanks for your take, DB!
The second I heard the mass energy conversion thing, I know that Cole was gonna win. And because of goddam fine print that had no real impact in his story or media.
Really frieza vs megatron megatron stands no chance. Frieza can destroy planets with just a finger.
Anything they create is a masterpiece, you can't prove me wrong
You guys purposely nerfed him and he STILL won....thats rough buddy
I have several issues about the ending of the fight   it looked like cole absorbed alex's powers however thats not possible as alex isn't a conduit he is a living virus also alex survived a nuke that lil electric bodyslam would not have killed him
When Cole said "Get ready to feel my MacGrath!" and Alex replied "Then I won't have any Mercer on you!", I knew this was 'bout to be peak fiction.
Are you kidding me Cole Macgrath is more superior than Alex Mercedes is a joke to be
I was surprised Cole won as I thought it'll be an absolute stomp on Alex's part but this was still cool to see.
Next Death Battle win or lose one fandom is gonna raise hell
Man, mal hecho todo. Absolutamente todo mal hecho. Literal una vez que Alex consume a su victima, acaba con el. Aparte el nivel de reaccion de mercer es ultrasonico. Sin mencionar, claro esta, que sobrevivio a una bomba atomica
We did it everyone, we made this happen and they delivered.
This Is How Imagine A Fight Between Timeskip Boruto And Kawaki Going
A tiny Frost Demon Vs. a giant Cybertronian...yup, this could be close but I STILL think Frieza will die
Many factors were not taken into account of Alex’s side of the battle and feats since they stopped scaling him at End of P1 Alex compared to P2 Alex which was far superior, so Cole obviously won but still the badass fight and song made up for my sour mood of an Alex L which should’ve been a W.
18:58 19:00 😂
This fight right here was one of the coolest fights so far in my opinion XD
The episode was really good, but PLEASE correct the title. Don't do like Wolverine VS Raiden and Skyrim VS Dark Souls...
Spoliers                       On who'd win on Freeza vs megatron it depends on what theyre allowed to have idk off hand how strong black frieza is or if he can use destruction energy and while his gold form is comparable to forms like blue evolved and legendary green there isnt really a set limit on say galvatrons unicronian power especially considering his.... insanity
Alex had no chance lol
this was one of best fight DEATH BATTLE ever created and i really want to see kids family friendly cartoon battle like My little pony VS Paw patrol, at least one of the main characters.
It feels weird having a death battle on my birthday over 2 characters I know nothing about. Hyped for the next one though.
NO BLOODY WAY THEY ARE DOING FRIEZA VS MEGATRON. nemesis is gonna have a field day with this one lol.
Lost Wages has Frieza as a 2-1 fave over Megatron...because they're not sure if Megatron's cannon can destroy a planet like Frieza can.  PLACE YER BETS!!!
What the f was that bgm, I almost muted the video, the song did not fit the characters
You can tell this is an old script from the TeamFourStar reference
I dont even read the transformers comics, but i know how they powerful really are. Sorry for my lovely Frieza, but seems like dragon ball death battle curse still standing.
As soon as they mentioned Cole's atomic resistance and regen, I knew it was over. Atomic Regen > Molecular Regen.
Ok, I feel like next battal is a no brainer. Before freza ever even changed forms he was one shoting planets.
Freeza vs megatron next time ……..   how is this fair? freeza can blow up planets and megatron can hardly blow up a city. As far as I know anyway if you know better pls inform me
Alex could win with prep. You guys just had to have him eat the right people before the fight. Am thinking some martial artists would have given him a nice edge in skill. Perhaps enough to allow him even the odds abit.
The Next Death Battle is a battle that I am incredibly interested in
Frieza vs Megatron is umm... I don't think it's close.. someone explain it to me what Megatron can do to Frieza. Im curious.
ahh so amazing! if you asked me 7 years ago id have argued to the end that alex wins but I see now that Cole has a more powerful and diverse power set.
Why was Cole even opening other peoples packages? He deserved it
Hopefully now these characters can be used in different matchups  although the debate between these two will never stop lmao. Great fight either way
Cole Macgrath - "You see, powers don't kill people, oh no. It's the person behind the powers that kill people."  As a huge inFamous fan, I have waited a long time for this, and seeing Cole Macgrath pull off the win was amazing. I just knew my favourite superhero of all time would win. Although got to give credit to Alex Mercer, who was powerful himself he put up an awesome fight.
The only way to make this better is to play Linkin Park behind it
Could we possibly get alucard vs. vlad dracula tepes (hellsing vs. castlevaina)
YES FINALLY MEGATRON VS FRIEZA
Great now I got a question, Couldnt Alex just try to absorb Cole in and finish him off like that?
It depends if they use IDW, if they do that, Megatron stomps   (Sure as hell that they wont 💀)
this was basically a superhero vs supervillain fight. and the hero always wins
Yes!  I am so glad Cole won!  Though Alex put up one hell of a fight.  I can’t believe I’m saying this but I think I’m cheering for Megatron next time.  Though I won’t be surprised if Frieza wins.
Eh I like alex more than cole but I guess this was a fair outcome . Nice fight and good music too
That was hype
After the last death battle episode became my favorite of all time, this one managed to upstage it. That quick, huh. With the music and the animation and the editing and the jokes…
Friza VS Megatron is up next and I'm just saying Megatron will win mostly just becuause I know a lot more about Megatron than I do with Friza.
O inspetor Gadget vs robocops... O... É que é o super-herói com facto robô.. Do Tio Patinhas
Where does this fit on that cipher wheal in thatjmage of the song from bill vs discord.
Frieza is universal at least his black form beat both goku and vegeta at peak forms with little effort but Megatron tho won't be easy I can see it going both ways
FREEEZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!
Spoilers!           Never play infamous nor prototype, but I rooted for Cole and I’m glad he won!
Still waiting for Nero vs Hellboy Also , finally this DB and Megatron vs Freiza
I'm not gonna lie, I thought Alex was going to win that fight, but it turns out cold took the victory. So congratulations, cold.
Sad we don't get games like this no mo way better than anything marvel or DC made or at least more interesting to me
Guess you say Alex Mercer felt the raw power of WRATH from Cole MacGRATH. Awesome Death Battle.
THE 3D TEAM HAS BEEN KILLING IT DUDE
Alex had two opportunities to win.
Release the Evil Cole cut you cowards!
Can you guys create a death battle for Vergil from dmc5 pls?
Spoilers for next episode         Why you got to brutalize Megatron like this?
Fellow InFamous fans... we got him.
I loved this song
I think Mashle would be more of a fair fight for Saitama.
Black frieza vs unicron would be a way cooler battle.
Premises was so terrible only watched whos next!
An electrifying death battle worthy of legend!
Yes!!! Good work Champions, you picked the right matchup!
Megatron vs Frezer is going to be f.cking badass
holy sh!t they finally did it     now what
On one side I'm pissed Alex lost. On the other the explanation why he lost isn't a cop out like some fights so I'll let it slide.
17:06  LET GO! I KNEW MY MAN COLE GOT THIS IN THE BAG! The good cole is just that OD against Alex. Good fight overall! You see! This is why a Max Triangle button comes in handy!!
Why you gotta do megatron dirty like that...
LETS GOO finally a dragon ball mu. Give it to my boy frieza
GET THIS EPISODE TO 10 MILLION VIEWS! Everyone on the Team that worked on it and this matchup in general deserves that much!
Honestly, im more excited for Frieza vs Megatron. Both because i want to see it, and because it adds to the growing list of reasons why Galactus vs Unicron is going to be the season finale
Been watching you guys for years and ive waited for this episode for so long! this fight was sick!!!!
Frieza Vs Megatron?! WTF?! That Makes Zero Sense?!
A freezer commits vehicular manslaughter
So glad they used all 3 Ionic Powers for Cole in the fight. Even the Tornado.
Next Time On Death Battle, Frieza VS Megatron
How is Frieza vs Megatron fair?
COME ON DEATH BATTLE CURSE!!!!  DO!!! YOUR!!! THING!!!
Monkey..
Favourite battle this season for me
As much as I was rooting for Cole, this did make me finally put Prototype on my Steam wishlist
Me: Watching the video and looking at the live chat A random guy in the chat: *CAN HE BEAT GOKU THOUGH?*
The winner is Jeremiah Valeska-Wesker.
Poor alex. He put in REAL EFFORT to live a normal and boring life. When i beat him in P2, i felt bad for him. Sick character tbh
Knowing death battle $5 says Megatron will win
Freiza vs Megatron comes out on Thanksgiving for Canada
"this world may not be perfect, but it sure as hell better without you" - Cole MacGrath  I may have misheard it a little but it is still the same
Finally💯💯🥹
Megatron???💀
This next one is gonna by epic
Freeza VS Megatron...can someone explain? This seems random dumb and one sided for Freeza
Easy dub for frieza
This is a episode
Alex's mistake was going for the suffering instead of the kill.
Somebody share this video with sucker Punch productions cc remaster needed and or sequel
Genuinely surprised cause i would have thought Alex would have won. I played both games but i was more partial to Prototype so i played that more. Not unhappy about the results but mab that was a crazy fight
Frieza vs Megatron? It's a no contest!
As an inFamous fan, I genuinely didn't think Cole would have a chance. And then the character explanation was specifically making this about Good Cole, not the Beast Cole, which made me even more curious about where this was going. Honestly the ending came as a surprise to me, but using Bioleech does make some sense.
Yeah no Frieza is getting absolutely demolished by Megatron.
COLE WINS  FRIEZA SHOULD WIN
Calling the winner of the next Death Battle now.  It’s gonna be Megatron
Finally some competition
Nahh this frieza Va megatron?!
Aww battle!!! Next week's battle is going to be crazy wild!!!!
Good guy Cole vs Scumbag Alex.  There's some 2013 humor for you.
personally i disagree but its an awesome fight regardless
What an odd old school match up
Of course my favorite always loses
LEETTTSS GOO COLLLEE!!! MY CHILDHOOD HERO!!
As a person who never knew of either of these two? Incredible episode
Raven vs Scarlet witch plzz
Rip Frieza
Oh hell yeah!
Man! i didn't know there was gonna be a death battle with those two, it's so awesome
This is not Banjo nor is it Kazooie
Good Cole uses Bio Leech as his Final Move Evil Cole still trapped in his Head:🤨 Hey that's my Move mr goody too shoes
This battle was crazy and electrifying can’t wait for more
Good battle!
Winchesters vs Brothers Grimm
That's gonna fire up the INFAMOUS fanbase!!!
Ive never seen or played either game but i had a feeling cole would win
As a long, long time Infamous fangirl  Cole, i am SO sorry for doubting you!!
Alex’s powers were bound by the elements which basically equaled the dub for cole
You need to do Ultron vs Brianiac!!! Battles of the AI!!
Nostalgic ass characters man. ❤
Yooooo
I have how Wiz said "Let's end this debate once and for all" like he used to say before the fight would start. I love how they wanted to make this feel like an old script they had just slept on doing for over a decade.
I knew death battle was gonna do something like this they always screw up
Brasil love
Alex Mercer fans are crying right now
Truly a Deathbattle I could enjoy
Cole is pure unadulterated awesomeness!
Cole doesn't win this
Well, now it's a screw up like goku vs superman.
Note to self, don't check the live chat ever again
cole yeah 🙂🙂🙂
I knew coal would win
I thought Alex was going to win
That's my boy!!!!!
Fair enough, I stand corrected from my previous comment. Noice
Cole pulled an uno reverse lol
The death was terrible ngl
No way
My boi cole
Is it me, or did the song for this fight kind of remind me of edgy songs form the 2000s like Linkin Park? (Linkin Park as an example)
Yes he won
Cole also has fire powers lol
Mercer Better win this
Alex: If you don't want to give me your power...fine! I'll just take it!  Cole: Good idea!  Brought to you by "Time huh? Thanks for the tip!".  Well, those lines ended up reminding me of that line, anyway.
PlayStation smash
What a shocking ending but this electrifying battle was so cool!!! Cole had no Mercer for Alex!!  Not everyone gets to fight their dark reflection so enjoy it while it lasts, Cole!  WOW! Even when it comes to villainy Cole is way better than Alex!!  Cole makes a better hero AND villain than Alex.  Cole is basically Alex 2.0!  How ironic for ZEUS to die of electrocution.  I never knew how much bigger Alex was when using his Viral Armor.  Alex seems more powerful than usual since he can use multiple abilities at once, something he’s never done in the games, even when fighting James Heller. Not that it did him much good against Cole.  Can Alex really be called evil if he’s just a virus simply doing what’s in his nature as one?  Evil Boomstick isn’t much better than regular Boomstick, except in the looks department.  I bet Delsin Rowe and James Heller will be in Death Battle someday.  I can’t wait for Frieza vs. Megatron!!
Remember this the one that dies in its own cognuity dies in the death battle
The music is sick as hell
MUFFIN BUTTON!!!
Go alex
11:29 😮
This song is metal as sin
That's the whitest rap I have ever heard
can't wait for a debunk video of this fight
At some point yall have to do James Heller vs Delsin Rowe
The match I've been dreaming of since i was like 7
This too 2010 damn
So, Cole vs Mikoto
12:51  that right me right in the feels
ARMSTRONG/WESKER W024!!!
there a believable theory where Alex lets himself be defeated to test his predecessor he is the Virus he's can regen from any host
It’s time for a death battle!!!
Best death battle just starting for my birthday
Alex dies
death battle never disappoints to spread and cheeks and bless us with their wet sticky content great vid man.
Let’s gooooo Alex
Notice that the old "Let's end this debate once and for all" line was used when it was time for a Death Battle...
Am i the only one that found Alex Mercer’s powers disturbing?
10 years of  non emptied trash. Sounds like a YouTuber/streamer. Guess even cartoon characters can’t escape reality.

Shadow Cole BB
With great power comes great responsibility!
I mean, this is the fight we all thought about when the games came out. Alex has this in the bag.
“Read your mind like Goku’s Muffin Button”  I wasn’t expecting a DBZA reference but I loved it nonetheless
I am glad you mentioned E=mc squared. I know that very well.
Col wins I can already tell
Я ждал этого 5, нет 10 лет!
I am so excited about frieza vs megatron
I want the next Death Battle to have Kyle Rayner Green Lantern and I know he will win the fight at his full power
how will they scale Alex
😂😂 it's been a full 10 years since you had this one in the barrel?
💥💥
We need a sniper duel between DC’s Deadshot and Marvel’s Bullseye.
Rigged
Ye
I swear, if the Halloween episode this season doesn't include Hellboy, I'm going to be so angry.
Come on Cole!!!⚡
Yes! I'm just in time!
Lets see!
I got Alex
THE BATTLE BETWEEN 2 EDGY 2000S CHILDHOOD HEROES
RIP Alex
0:52 I'll be late to the party since I've got a lecture but yeah this is worth the wait
I personally don't care about these guys but i can only imagine how angry the fanbases will be considering how edgy they are
🎉
The wait is OVER!!!! And good lord What a good time to be a fan of Death Battle!
It's about time
I don’t know these guys much, but I can’t wait to see a good fight. And definitely can’t wait to hear the music again since it’s a bop to listen to.
Lets kick it up a notch and see who will win!💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
YOOO
I have been wanting to see this fight for years they are 2 of my favorite games of all time
Cole wins
I’ve waited for this fight for over 5 years now.
This matchup has been requested for a decade, and today it finally comes to an end.
Michael Jordon vs Lebron James
Nercer
Let's make death battle great again!!!!
I'm hoping for Cole to win, since he's the hero.
Come ooooon alex   COME OOOOOON ALEX
That next time is spicy
sly cooper Vs Rouge the bat
spoilers Cole wins 😂
I’ve been waiting for this match for a very long time and now I’m really excited
Spoilers for all you non-1st members and/or planet champions out there:            The next DEATH BATTLE is Frieza vs Megatron
IT/Pennywise vs. HIM (The Powerpuff Girls) for Halloween!
Cole mcgrath will win I knew it from the start
Patrick Star VS Richard Watterson (SpongeBob VS Gumball) | DEATH BATTLE!
Since these two are kind of like Spider-Man, the winner should take on Spider-Man himself in a future Death Battle. I am kidding, of course.
when cole said "i may be infamous but you are just a prototype compared to me" 🔥🔥🔥
Dang bro prototype 360 man such a good game at the time man
I wonder if they'll do Red skull vs Cobra Commander, you know like Dr Wiley vs robotic. 🤔
Hi Daniel
This gonna to be the sickest death battle ever.
Asriel Dreemurr vs Marisa Kirisame
Don't forget the whole death battle season fights can be predicted by using the cipher wheel from the season 10 trailer and megatron vs ultron doesn't fit the cipher so no frieza vs ultron won't be next time   Oh nevermind how in the hell does frieza vs Megatron fit in the cipher and seriously out all matches
I would love to see Yusuke urameshi vs kyo kusanagi in death battle one day yuyu hakusho vs king of fighter
The Cole & Alex vs Time Memes shall stop now
Pennywise Vs Freddy Krueger.   Pinned vs Candyman.   Dennis the manace Vs desperate Dan ( Beano vs Dandy comic ).   Cammy white Vs Dana pink lightspeed rescue ranger ( Street fighter vs  power rangers).   Taylor yellow wild force Ranger Vs Sonya blade ( power rangers Vs mortal Kombat).   Booster Gold Vs Johnny cage.   Scorpion Vs Excalibur ( Mortal Kombat Vs Warframe).   Sub zero vs Frost ( mortal Kombat Vs Warframe).
Ez win for Alex
This is the most anticipated matchup of all time, and now it has finally gonna happen, we're making history bois!!!!
Why didn’t I think of this
Esta batalla estará épica  Cole vs alex 😈👌🏻
When Alex Mercer goes for a walk, he asked his enemies how's their health plan.  Apparently it was great.
Hey any chance you chould do Emiya archer vs Erza scarlet
My money's on Cole MacGrath.
This is gonna be a SHOCKING battle with BLOODY results.
Next death battle  Naomi mcduffie vs Monica rambeau  Kick ass vs Casey jones  Hit girl vs Damian Wayne  Alucard vs spawn Ethan hunt vs Jason Bourne  Green lantern vs captain marvel  Venom vs shinichi Izumi  John snow vs Aragorn  Denji vs wolverine  And 1 with Rambo John McClain xenomorph demogorgon hellboy, jack sparrow Indiana jones, Kamala Khan ironheart morbius and America Chavez
I would love to see Sailor Mercury vs Tecna (Sailor Moon vs Winx Club)
Cole has UNLIMITED POWER while Alex has UNLIMITED REGENERATION!
ELECTRO VS CARNAGE IS GONNA BE SICK
Where’s the Ben 10 match??
I never played Infamous or Prototype but this Death Battle does make me wanna try the games out. I heard a tiny bit about their games but never actually watched gameplays or anything, so I would be completely new.
Killer Croc vs Leatherhead (DC vs TMNT)
The moment Cole disintegrates Alex or Alex infects Cole would be the deciding one
This death battle is gonna be sick
i believe alex can regenerate brain neuro-electricity fast enough to not die and react to his attack and his infection ability is far stronger than whatever mindcontrol thing that bug lady had, i think alex lost this one cus hes now a villain and he has to lose, unlike cole who is a hero so scriptwriters had to be biased towards cole. i understand and its ok if alex loses cus i didnt like prototype 2 alex either but if you say proto 1 alex loses to inf 1 cole then idk what to say to you. also no idea where the 5 nanosecond thing comes from, esp that 66% of lights speed lol
Hell yeah you know it is a lit time for me
Infamous FTW
We all know that Infamous’ Zeke and Boomstick would be amazing best friends
This is an interesting one. Coming to us all the way from the console wars of yore.  It was usually said, Infamous had the better games, but Prototype was more fun.
Major spoilers before the battle:Both characters officially in their games are dead. So I'm not mad on whomever wins. Both die in their sequel games...but...Cole does technically have a third game (well,DLC,Actually) where he is a vampire and second son and first light picks up where it left off in Seattle ironically where i live. Hoping death battle doesn't use this to give cole a edge. Should be a interesting battle. Both have good and evil choices and intentions too. I've played both series of games and they are good. This is going to truly be a Good vs. Evil battle! My money is on cole,but we will see...after watching:looks like i won that bet. Cole won.
This was a awesome battle. And I knew Cole was going to win. And I'm not excited for the next time aka Frieza vs. Megatron for a couple of reasons the first is unless it's Cybertron Megatron they have nothing in common as G1/IDW Megatron is a freedom fighter turned anti-villain tyrant. Then depending on the version of Megatron used one of several outcomes will happen those being if it's G1 Cartoon Megatron then it's a automatic win for Frieza as G1 Cartoon Megatron stands no chance against Frieza, if it's Cybertron Megatron or IDW Megatron then Frieza is screwed beyond belief. Either way I'm hiding in my anti-salt storm bunker as no matter what the outcome is you're going to have toxic Dragon Ball Fans and toxic Transformers Fans going at each other.
alex... you got owned!!!!!
For many years, we have waited. And now that this episode has come out, it has become the most EPIC AND BADASS EPISODE OF THE SEASON!!!   2009 nostalgia be peaking!
Omg which side am i on a flying maniac or a jumping maniac i pick jumpy guy but jokes aside yeah alexes gonna win this imo this man goes through apocalypses like its Tuesday i still do think its gonna be a hard battpe tho bc ive upgraded cole way too much on the boys gonna do god level damage every second
I don’t care who win the fight I just want to watch video I care about battle and animated That’s all
Boomstick: In the end Cole gave Alex, NO "MERCER"

Merser winner🏆🎉🏆
Cole: considered yourself, “Grounded.”
Not that I don't want to see Alex Mercer in the fight, but why not use James Heller instead?
Man they really low ball cole also finally another right again
Alex: "I think I still got room for dessert" Cole: "Buddy, you are one sick freak"
I probably won't be able to see this when it comes out till later on today so can some just only tell me who's the next one please and thank you when this comes out.
I was the one who pitched this idea years ago.
Cole Magrath won
Edgelord vs a man who can be an Edgelord or not. I would prefer Cole to win but Alex will be a tough opponent.
And now the wait for Delsin Rowe vs. James Heller begins....
I'm Picking Cole To Win From infamous and I'm Looking Forward To See The Next Death Battle Fight
ELECTRO VS CARNAGE IS GONNA BE SICK!!!!
One of the most requested matches in Death Battle finally came. This was worth the wait no matter who wins.
Asking for an Assassin's Creed battle Royale death battle

C'mon cole
Shendu(Jackie Chan Adventures) vs Diablo(Diablo Video Games).
Who would be excellent opponents for the Swat Kats on Death Battle?
