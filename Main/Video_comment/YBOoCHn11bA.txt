Cute little tip for baby "pony tails": While her hair is still wet, spread it to look like a fountain. Leave it as is and it will dry looking like little fountains.

Not les setting off my Alexa 😅
Adorable
Nyc
Safety tip, I always kept a little bag for my babygirl’s clips to take with me and then put the clips in when at our destination. Baby’s pull on their hair sometimes and can pull the clips off and you know babies, they put everything in their mouths. While driving, your eyes aren’t always on them so just thought I’d share that tip out there. 🩷🦋 she’s so precious. The
nice
Oo that’s nasty bro ok 3:30
Aww Kaeli is so adorable and love her birthday theme

My Alexa turned on when you were playing music 😂

HER LITTLE FACE IS EVERYTHING. :) SO ADORABLE !

Do you speak to the kids in Spanish as well?
Omg those pictures came out so adorable and great!!!
Girly she’s ur twin!!!
when you want to do designs on the walls of the cake, try drawing it lightly with a toothpick first 😊
The hair sticking up is the cutest! I loved how cute my daughter was with it sticking up
Super cute but I got super anxious at the choking hazard of the pearls you put on the cake 🫣😫 lol
You should buy wraps for her! Big bows they are sooo cute
She’s so cute 🥰 my baby is turning 1 next month too 😭
Sometimes I wonder if Baby G aka “Papi” even knows that his actual name is Gael!! 😂 I actually had to think about his real name before typing it LOL Also, Kaelis smoosh faces in the beginning is the absolute cutest!
Adorable...🥰🥰🥰
Not my alexa turning on when you said alexa play karol g 😅
Les in that dress so pretty 😍😍💓💓
Not me screaming i don’t like it when you were pipping it. Glad we think the same
So cute ❤ she beautiful
She looks just like your fam and baby g looks just like Alex
I just wanted to give you a safety tip. Please be careful with what type of hair pins/clips you put on your baby’s hair. She can very easily take them off and put them in her mouth, and that can be hazardous for your baby. I know their cute and all but you need to be more concern about what’s safe and what’s cute. Because believe me I have a daughter too and we can go crazy with dressing them up with all these cute stuff. Love you girl. Take care. Beautiful family. ❤️🎊🎉🎈🥰🎂🍬🍭🍼
OMG Les I did the same for my daughters birthday! 🍓🍓🍓🍓I absolutely love strawberries we are obsessed over here 😂😂😂
Awww I just love seeing Les so happy!! All excited for the littlest things like the hair clips haha she’s such a loving momma 🥰 can’t wait for the pics!
U should try the risitos de oro bebe gel I love it
Be careful with the smaller clips since her hair is so straight she can easily take them off and God forbid she puts it in her mouth.
Les can you share where you got your dress from please! 🤍💕🤍
Hello tinkerbell😂😂😂
Be careful!  Make sure the clips you use cant fit thru a toilet paper tube!  Most of the ones you showed us are choking hazards for a baby!!! It only takes a second for hernto grab it out and put it in her mouth. If its just for a picture or quick video and you keep eyes on her the whole time, it should be fine.  Better safe than sorry.
Her little nose scrunches 😩💕
I hope baby K has an awesome birthday !! She's growing so fast ❤🎉🎉😘
les, thank you for keeping me entertain during work! i cant get over how cute momma girl is! she gives me major baby feverrrrrr 💕
Her smash cake pictures are going to be adorable! The setup is perfect and she looked precious. 💚🍓
She is adorable!
So adorable!!! Baby G with the spray bottle still. That was a big hit at my house too. 😂

Mama girl's faces are everything  aye
Kk definitely has Les’ eyes 🥰
Loved the video les❤
Aww I miss my baby girl being this small 😢 mama girl is sooo cute. I love them at this age. Thanks for sharing with us that you are hiring, definitely going to submit my resume :) Cant wait to see her pictures ❤
Les is really living the dream life, she has her cute little family, dream home, shares an office with her bestie. Wow such an inspo congrats on all your success Les!🥰🥰🥰
seems selfish saying “Omg I have an addiction to clips” like girl do you care about your baby or just dressing her up
yikes!  you shouldn't advertise to your fans that you're hiring!!  dangerous!  you should be hiring anonymously through a company!  just sayin'!
So cute❤
She's so unimpressed with her facial expressions. I love it.
Girl you making all our Alexas go off lol
Alex with his dramatic roll out had me dying 😂☠️☠️
Daddy what’s this???  Alex: ewww that’s nasty bro 😂💀 parenting win
I have that mister spray bottle and it’s the best. I can only imagine Kaeli’s Quince 😆 🎂🥳
If she isn’t ur dads & sisters twin idk what is ! Cute theme !
Does anyone just fast forward to the cake making?!! Lol she talks so much and it takes forever to get to the good stuff😂
Alex is the perfect partner that every girl want to have in her life 😢🎉❤
Not me here just admiring How smart and talkative is baby G love this 🥰 She’s just a babydoll God bless her love this girl mom erra for you  ❤
Ricitos de oro gel works well too and it doesn’t leave any white residue 😊
Does anyone have recommendations for girls with curly hair? Products? Hair care tips? ❤❤❤
🍓🍓🍓 CUTEST BABY 🍓🍓
Alex rolling out 💀💀
Baby girl is the cutest ❤ also girl try Ricitos de Oro Gel it’s for kids I’ve used that on my babies and love how it smells and it’s not harsh on their hair like regular gel
What a beautiful shoot for your little baby girl! Also I love that you released this when you are shooting the campaign in real time. And tell Alex not to worry that she will lose half of those hair clips, little girls lose all their bows, but be thankful you miss the $17 jojo Siwa bows lol
Thanks for sharing and bringing us along, she is EVERYTHING! Awwwww <3
That was the cutest video ever💕 Love you guys…#perfectlittefamily✨ stay positive🥰
Love her little cute face💕💕💕💕 she is so adorable just like mommy!!! Can’t wait to see her pics!!!

Hi. Eye twitch is a sign of electrolytes imbalance. Check ur potasium and magnesium
Les where is your dress from?
Les be the one to create a sports bra that has padding that doesn’t roll up or look weird after the wash
Osito de oro gel is amazing I use it on my son and love it 😊
Alex is MEEE sniffing the patiitas 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
I still can't figure out who she looks like
It’s so sweet of Les and Alex to vlog and share these family moments. 🥰
When I would do my daughters ponytails I would fold it so the hair wouldn't stick up like that. They were like little chongitos lol
Haaaahaha lol Ewww thats nasty Bro.... Oh ok...😄😆
Get a a mini straightener and curl her ends on the colitas 😊
So cute. Her faces are the best. 🍓 💖💖

I had to start doing my daughters hair at 2 months 😂 its a blessing and a curse cus she hates getting her hair styled 😩 and i have to style it everyday or else she cant see🫠

Que hermosa 💖  Okay les maybe one won’t hurt , she convinced me 😂
The hair accessory made me cringe… chocking hazard.😮 yikes
Lea you look so beautiful 🤩 I love the strawberry theme!
I still can’t believe you have a little girl 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 and she about to be one 🥰🥰🥰
Please tell me I am not the only one who laughed so hard when Baby G kept asking what the wax stick was and proceed to throw it after Alex told him it was nasty. 3:25 😂

The cake turned out so cute & she looked so adorable!! I can’t wait to see the pictures ❤
Yes gurl I got 4 daughter's and I completely understand going super overboard when it comes to hair styles, hair accessories, etc... Don't forget the hair tye remover though..(for the tiny rubber bands only) ...makes it way smoother to remove them without all the extra tugging.
Stick toothpicks in the sides of the cake so you know where to drop and connect the “ribbon”
Omg her cute little face 🥰
So cute !!! 😍
The very PRESENT parents you and Alex are…. I just🥹♥️  I remember from the very beginning when you were telling him that you were pregnant with Baby G! And his words were “I’m going to be a dad!!” The pride and joy he felt from the beginning! 😭♥️ I always knew y’all would be amazing. But gosh!🥹♥️
Congratulations soo proud of you 😊
