❤,💐
Seeing her sister come in made me so emotional. I am 15 weeks with my second and her sister is 10. I was worried about the age difference but I loved seeing this so much! My first was also a c section so I’m hoping for a VBAC too. I loved how relatable this was for me 🥹
Congratulations on your new baby girl. ❤😊
She is 3 days after my birthday
Happy 2nd birthday, Poppy Wren ♥
She is beautiful love the love in Jayden’s. She is going to be the best big sister. Beautiful family. Congratulations to each of you❤️
My daughter name is khalia Alexandhrea hewitt 💖
Just now seeing this video. Congratulations on Poppy. I know she’s a great addition to your family. (She picked a great day to be born - my birthday). Many blessings for Poppy as she continues to grow and also for your family.
Does anyone else think that Jadyn looks like chelsea lascher
Good luck 23:38
Such a beautiful name ❤
No one needs make up u look perfect and cute the way u are I swear to god u to Brittany and Jayden
Aww jay ur so cute when u put on her clothes when u closed it! I wanna cry!?
Aw our girls are born a year and three days apart! My oldest is 7/28/21 and my youngest is 8/13/22. Congrats!! So happy for you!
The second Jayden started crying, sister moment right there 😢
Congratulations!
Super cute ❤🎉🎉
Amazing! I didn’t even see the name in the footage …. lol 😆 but congratulations!!!!🎉🎈
The fact that she got the name off of 4 weeks poppy seed
It is good to see a dad in love with his daughter, my father was disappointed and called me "another cook." He wasn't even there when I was born, I am glad he wasn't now that I am in middle age because I think it was important for me in particular to be alone with my late mother. I think Poppy is lucky to have such a great dad.
Social media at its weirdest, grotesque best. And as bizarre a name for girl as calling it 'Greg'!
The fact youtube commented this Congratulations ✨🍼what a beautiful name!
BRO KIDS WATCHING THIS -
10:49 🥺🥺🥺🥺
I love that his shirt has poppy flowers on his shirt! So precious! Congrats!

Congratulation's
WTF 16
I love this!! Brits face when Jadyn walked in was priceless!! I love your sweet little fam and wish you all the best!
I sat in the back on the way home from the hospital, it was not even a 5 minute drive and they insisted on me feeding him before we left, he burped changed diapie all the goods..we get half way home and he starts trying to spit up and I couldn't open the buckle to the car seat so he started choking on his spit up and my instant reaction was to undo the who carrier and flip him forward a little bit so he was choking on it!! I almost had a dang heart attack an since we had pulled over we sat on the side of the road for about 30 minutes cause I was scared as soon as I put him back in the seat and he was all buckled he was goin to do it again!! If it was winter, I probably would of walked him home!! Lol
OMG me and poppy have the same birthday

When I had a baby sister I was shocked and it was one of the best mornings I have ever had Congrats 🎉
Congratulations beautiful! So happy for your family :) I was an only child, in 8th grade myself and 14 yrs old when my mom got pregnant with twins, one boy and one girl. They are turning 10 years old this year and my God, this video brought back all the memories. I had the same reaction as Jadyn when I found out my mom was pregnant and when I met her after the birth as well. I only wish I had a video myself to keep as a memory. I couldn't stop myself from bawling while watching this video. God bless you and your beautiful family :) XOXO
Guys i looooove your video ...but you know that poppys are not ranuculus and no anemones 🙄 and the field where ranuculus ...only to save my florists proudness ...all the best for the little poppy cutie 😉
I had tears 🥺❤️
Congratulations guys beautiful baby!

Congratulations 🎉 u are the best mother to ur girls 💜💞💚💚💙💜🖤❣❤🧡
Brittany!  You and I were pregnant at the exact same time!  I found your video about being 19 and pregnant some time in April as I have such a guilty pleasure for birth stories, and absolutely fell in love with your entire story, how you met Anthony, how your daughter was essentially the reason you bonded with Anthony based on his own history, and how your life totally found its direction because of a pregnancy you hadn't wanted.  It's such a special story, and I was also so excited to see that you and I were pregnant at the same time.  I had to comment on your video because it turns out that our babies share a name.  I had twin boys, Ren Olivier, and Hiro Asher.  So when I saw that my son's first name has so much in common with your daughter's middle name, I was doubly thrilled.  Our son's name is spelled slightly differently as it's the Japanese word for sacred flower, and is most often used for a male child.  Anyway, I would absolutely love to talk with you some time, and wanted to share how wonderful it's been following your family's journey, especially through this pregnancy.  Hope our Wren/Ren will get to meet some day.
Omg, you guys are so lucky to have so many people in the hospital room! Such a beautiful family!
Congratulations!!! Omg poppy ist soooo adorable!
I literally cried so hard whenever I saw Jaden‘s reaction your baby is so cute I also love the name poppy
Wow this is such a cool coincidence because Abbie Herbert gave birth sometime and her name is Poppy as well!
Omg I cried the whole time! She is so cute!!!
Bless your beautiful lovely famil, so happy for you 💙💙🥰🥰
Omg I was like " IS IT POPPY?! IS IT ITS SO BEAUTIFUL" and I was LITTRELLY crying she is so precious and again Jayden is SOO HAPPY 😭❤️
You 4 will be very kind to her and be good parents
The pandemic babys apparently all can hold up there head good
so so beautiful Brittany and Anthony! Can't stop crying 😢 such an amazing time,can't wait to meet my baby

Isn’t their another tiktok couple who named their baby poppy just a couple months ago too
Her name in Spanish is  "Amapola" and is so elegant and beautiful!!!!!  I'm so happy for you guys, and the name is precious
I feel honoured 😉 congrats!
Is it dualipa?😻😁
Not to be rude, but in all the videos it kind of seems that she loves poppy more, not to be rude.
💐
AWW POPPYS THE CUTEST NAME
Jayden is the spitting image of Brittany's mom. It's crazy how much they look alike.
Congratulations to the both of you! Little Poppy is so perfect. Absolutely beautiful. ❤️I also wanted to comment how happy I am to see Anthony getting to be involved in baby's first moments. It wasn't until recently that men could be so heavily involved with baby bonding like skin to skin contact right after birth, so it's a really beautiful thing.
Poppy is like Abbie’s herbets daughter
Poppy is Abby and Josh’s baby’s name But they both have there Own like reason it’s so cute 🥰
She is so cute 💕
Congratulation!! Brittany & Anthony, he’s a dad!

She was born on my birthday happy earth day poppy your a true blessing and I’m happy to share the 16th of august with you 🤍♌️
Your mom looks like caityln but younger
I started following Brittany when I had just found out I would be pregnant as a single mother while in school as she shared her stories about raising her first daughter. Brittany hadn’t announced she was pregnant yet! Crazy enough, Poppy was born the same day as my babygirl! Thank you for sharing your story and life to a young mother like me.
she’s so tiny😭😭😭
I can't wait to see her grow up💗
Congratulations to your family, wishes from far away vietnam
I started crying when Jadyn saw Poppy for the first time. I was a teenager when my little sister was born as well. And when I tell you, that age gap means nothing when it comes to sisterly love. She is the person I love most and I wouldn’t trade her for the world. I also love her nickname for Poppy. Ever since my sister was born, I have always called her my little Petunia flower. Seeing someone else go through a similar experience as me just warms my heart. Jadyn is gonna be the best big sister and Poppy is just gonna adore her!! 💕💕💕 Congratulations to you all🎉
It’s so amazing to hear what you’ve been thru then having an incredible husband and a supportive teenage daughter that you’ve always been upfront with. I look up to you.. seriously congratulations on little miss poppy.. I found you on tik tok and I’m forever grateful. Family of four. 🥰
What an absolute doll! Congratulations!
I love her name!
poppy like abbie herbert’s baby and they were born like 2 months apart 🥺 the two pregnancies that i follow because of tiktok it’s so cute 🤧
@abbyherbert and @joshherberts daughter name is poppy to!
SO CUTE !! New borns are never as cute as this !!!
Awww oh my god poppy is so adorable!!!my mom has one more week left till she gives birth
So happy for you guys. Enjoy every moment 💕
love her name it’s so weird because i have a dog named poppy and then my mom told me once that she would have named me wren or my middle name. ANYWAYS CONGRATS SHES SO CUTE!
Can u not this baby is so adorable 🥰 she’s so pretty as well congrats brittny I’m so happy for u love u guys❤️❤️❤️
I also have a little brother and we have 12 yrs age gap. When my mother told me back then that im gonna have a brother I threw a tantrum like every kid. Now i have this kid following me, breaking down my walls and I always tell people how children though noisy and unruly can truly change our lives for the better. Congratulations to the birth of your little angel. And  I salute you to going through that experience as I had witnessed it firsthand how tiring and painful it can be to mothers. I pray for that child's good health and that she may bloom to a bright flower just like her name <3
♡︎ She’s so Beautifull ♥︎
oh my goodness she is the cutest little baby i’ve ever seen 😍god bless you guy and your limitless bundle of joy you guys are already the greatest parents ever wish you guys the very best
Started bawling when Jayden saw her for the first time 😭 Beautiful family, enjoy.x
so happy for you gays
I AM ALSO POPPY    When my parents found out that they were expecting, I was the size of a poppy seed. After they found out, they went for a walk & sat by a tree. The tree had the name ‘Poppy’ carved into it. They didn’t find out my sex until I was born & throughout the whole pregnancy my dad would still call me Poppy.   Plus I’m a redhead so the name links haha.  What a beautiful name (if I do say so myself). Congratulations x
when is the nursery tour with AD coming out

In Greek Poppie/Poppy is the short name from the muse Calliope. In Greek mythology, Calliope is the Muse who presides over eloquence and epic poetry; so called from the ecstatic harmony of her voice. Hesiod and Ovid called her the "Chief of all Muses"
GOD LOVES YOU GOD SENT HIS ONLY SON JESUS TO DIE ON THE CROSS FOR our sins
Your beautiful baby is a Leo Sun, Sagittarius Moon and a Capricorn Rising 💖💖 a perfect mix!!

Thank you so much for sharing your beautiful journey! I cried so many times throughout your pregnancy when you first found out, to telling Anthony, to sharing with Jadyn, and now the actual birth. Such a beautiful, emotional, sentimental story and I’m so happy for you guys!! It’s lovely to see the joy, you all deserve it🥰🥰. Happy Birthday Poppy!!Sending lots of love from Australia! 🥳🥳
I actually have a tattoo of a poppy flower, it’s my favorite due to it reminding me of all my summers at my grandpas farm on the Swedish island Gotland
What a beautiful baby, and her neck is strong, I’ve never seen a newborn do that.  I remember your story with Jadyn,  and the love you have with Jadyn is amazing.  This time you have an amazing husband who loves his three girls so much.  I love watching you guys, I’ve never seen a closer family and I can’t wait to see Poppy in your videos. Congratulations🏵🏵🏵🌺🌺🌺
omg congratulations ❤ i was waiting so long for her 🥰
A Swedish illustrator from the early 1900 painted a lot of flowergirls, one with Poppys. The Swedish brand Design house Stockholm sells coffee cups with these illustrations. You should get it, I have it and love it! Poppy translates to Vallmo in Swedish ❤️
Oh my lord! I don’t I’ve ever seen a family this beautiful, this perfect! God bless you all. I hope one day you and Andy will get to hold Jadyn’s and Poppy’s babies. The plans God makes always amazes me. Jadyn looks like she’s going to be an amazing big sister. She knew the perfect time to enter into your life. Like Rumi said once “ why are you worried your life is going to upside down, how do you know the other side isn’t better?” I hope every single one of you a healthy, happy and lonngg longg years! Welcome Poppy!
She is so precious!! Congratulations!

My sister and I are 13 years apart and watching Jayden & Poppy brought back so many feels 😭🥺❤️❤️❤️
Omg I love the name! A dutch Youtuber (Beautygloss) had her little girl a year ago and during the pregnancy they called her Poppy, cuz a pregnancy app told them that the size of the baby was as big as a poppy seed. Now Poppy is the second name of their baby and I'm totally loving this coincidence 🥰
I'm so happy for you and baby poppy and congratulations 💕💕
Pregnancy is hard, but worth it at the end
Congratulations, lots of love and joy always! Welcome POPPY S2
She is so cute 😍 congrats 👏! I'm so happy for you and your family 🥰🥰🥰
She's so precious.  Poppy had me in tears when she looked up at her mommy for the first time—so alert and aware.  Congrats to Dad and Big Sis!  You're the sweetest mother, and thanks for sharing this most special moment with us.
I love her zo much 😩❤️🤣
She was born on my sisters  birthday 😌She’s so cute
She looks like Brittany
Congratulations to your whole family. It's so wonderful because I follow Abbie from the Herbert family, she has a little baby, Poppy James. I binge watch their Tiktok and YouTube, and I was talking to my little sis that have been waiting stalking your account since morning for your name reveal. I actually said what if her name would be Poppy too and now I opened my YouTube and am very shocked. Congratulations to your whole family. I love you guys and can't wait to see more of Poppy. I have two Poppys now😁. Welcome to the world Poppy Wren Xavier❤️. Brittany you look so beautiful, you're a super mum.  I apologise for the long comment.

Poppy is so precious 🥳😘
Congratulations mom and dad and of course big sister Jaydn. Brittany, Poppy is absolutely beautiful as is her name. Like a little Princess Poppy. God bless you all. I'm so happy to hear you had a good pregnancy and had a healthy and safe delivery. I love how you all picked her name too. I'm all for that. I know how Anthony feels (my husbands name too) about losing someone and wanting to use their name. Our daughter will be 2 in December and coming up with her name didn't take us to long to come up with. His mother, who's name was Rita, actually passed away shortly after we told her we were expecting. She was the first person we told and had been in and out of the hospital with complications. Unfortunately though she passed before we found out the gender of our baby. My father was the 2nd person, whom I am extremely close with. Now my father and my grandfather (God rest his soul) share the same name Sr. and Jr. So with their middle names being Lee and my middle name Leigh, we decided to combine his mothers name and our middle names. We named out daughter Ritleigh Olivia-Rose, bc her last name starts with an I her nickname and everyday name is Rori bc of her initials. Not on purpose but her nickname is also very meaningful to my father and I bc as then teenager my father and I watched the entire show of Gilmore Girls and I always loved the name Rory played by Alexis Bledel. It's so special to us though and I love that you all thought of that as well when naming Poppy. Such a beautiful, sweet name. Oh I wish I could rewind and go back to when my baby girl was itty-bitty. Such special moments during that time. I still love her the same and now that she's growing into her personality it's the best. Again Brittany and Anthony congratulations on your sweet baby girl. I know she is going to be sooo sooo loved, she has no idea just how much she is already loved by so many. You all take care and take all the time you need to rest and enjoy every moment. Love you all 🥰🥰🥰
I am soo happy  for y'all  she so cute 🤍🤍🤍
