NOTE: They changed the range of the Giant Cannon so the Wizard on BH10 is difficult to outrange it. Instead use a Giant in front of the regular cannon to tank first so that your Wizard is safe.

Damn time flies...
i cant believe i played this 2 years ago already...
Is there any other chance to get the battle machine skin that was in this video?
Wizards more like single target in frineo  😂
We need another mini game like this in coc
uhh... judo, are the bonanza challenges a limited time event? because when I log on to my builder base, I don't see the bonanza challenge icon near the shop icon. I just need some clarification, please!
After 5 months they haven’t really added any gold passes skins or sceneries to the shop :( for game mode
🗿🗿🗿
Where do you go to initiate these?
Why Iam confused coz that the same layout in my base also 😢
Can u still get the skins
Guys how do I get these challenges?
What BH lvl u unlock this???
I just saved your video to watch later and uninstalled coc that time (in May) because of my university exams and now downloaded coc and knowing that it was a limited event 😢😢😢😂
I really think it's amazing the challenge, but the sad thing is that I wasn't able to play the challenge because of a matter of time and I couldn't get the battle machine skin. I don't know if everyone got to play it, but I think we should have another try if it's possible, by the way good video Judo Sloth.
wow good 😎😎😎
you are the vest
I miss that update😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
How do you unlock bonanza challenges?
fck i missed the challenge😤😤😤
First time meeting them and listening to you, I am very interested in this game
This video was so informative, thank you for sharing your knowledge.
Such an inspirational video this is. 😍❤💖
Thank you judo 🇰🇭🙏🇬🇧
I missed it. Will it come back?
Bro he is cute 😭
😐👍
I can't see the challenges, is it over?
Thank you! Also voted for you on the Mobies and will do so every day to June 30th!
im the guy who does it last second before challange goes away thanks did it all 1 one go!
Judo love ur content, but the amount of ads in this video is off the charts. one lot came half way through a challenge. plz don't make me look elsewhere for this stuff. thx.
He is the best.
Gold
Best clash tutorials !! I used someone else for this challenge and i was having a hard time i used your strat and 3 starred first try everytime
You're the best!!
I forgot about these challenges but as soon as I remembered them I jumped right to this channel  😍😍 what's the music title at BH7 ?
Couldn't have done these without your help.
Thanku so much judo for vidio from nepal🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵❤️❤️❤️😊
The fact that you can simultaneously watch this video and perform the attack yourself in real time makes this the best walkthrough video on YouTube.  Nobody does it better than Judo. 💯
Thanks for the great video and instructions. Was struggling starting on BH2 so this saved me a lot of time and frustration.
THANKS JUDO!!
Thnx Bro🎉❤
thank you judo your helping me so much
Thank You Brother For The Best Strategies 🙌
Thank you for this video 😊
Thanks so much!
Great video
Thank You Judo, Voted for you.
i screwed up everything above buider base 6 but stil won thanks
Congratulations bro
thankyou judo❤😊
Thank U Judo Sloth.  I'm already subbed to you.
Thank you veru much, Judo!
I appreciate you so much, Judo!! I am clutch for this challenge, finished it all in less than 30 minutes with few retries in the top bases but in the end I manage to get 42 stars and all rewards. Thank you so much!!
Thank you so much ❤
Guys i am know it’s not the right place but i need some good attackers and active players for my clan we play daily wars and extremely active who would like to join please let me know i am struggling with it tbh 😂😂

Words can not express just how much my clan HATES these new Builder Base changes. They are making this game too time-consuming. The Builder Base used to be the nice change-of-pace. Now, it's just more "busy work." Who were the devs were listening to? They need to stop listening to them.
Judo I just want to personally commend you for your tutorials here. I am about the least strategic attacker in the entire playerbase and your guidance got me through all ten BB levels with minimal retries. Your attacks are so good infact that I messed several of them up and it didn’t even matter. You’re the absolute goat man.
i really thank you for giving guides on attacking every challenges,🙏
Very helpful
Thanks so much, been trying for days with no avail till I watched your vid,
The best🔥❤️
You're the best
Thanks for this man. I've been delaying taking this challenge for too long and did it in one sitting with your video. @JudoSloth
I complete builderhall 8 without seeing any video (Proud of my self😤)
thanks judo
Th 5 the cannon always goes to the wrong side
tnx dude u always good fight
Ty judo
Thank you!!!
thanks for the help mr sloth
what a great tutorial
Op🎉🎉
W guide judo
Why does it not let me use my reinforcement troops on the second stage ??
Voted ✅
Thanks brother
Amen God bless good video man
Thnks bro
Judo is coc 👑👑
Thanks aloooot❤❤❤
Voted and subscribed, good luck judo!
Thank you bro. I completed all. ❤
The game literally made the players like us to reclaim their belonging skin with a servant pact
Level 7 was very tough 😢😢
Bruh u just saved my life
I finished everything before seeing the video but judo cam and the edit makes the video very fun to watch anyway
I think clash is dying out. Supercell are just creating extra games in within the game. They have made our main village harder and everyone is getting bored. No new troops either. We have been using air for so long now with the archer blimp. Now we still have the archer blimp with a little ground. So many have given up on the game. It’s ok for the pro’s but what about your average guy that just plays for fun.
Let’s hit 100k likes on this video 🎉🖤💯🔥
Im not even good and i smoked the bonanza challenge ! Judo 🥋 Sloth 🦥
hat sehr geholfen
👍
great vid
love to watch your videos, really help me a lot. Thanks judo.
Thanks sir 🙏
This longer form compliation was so handy!
Thanks buddy for such a good tutorial 👍
damn I clutch the last one with no wizard and just the mega pekka ability to get rid of the mini zappy thanks for the info
New builder base is bad
just watched someone elses video and i still struggled. came over to judo, no struggle at all. judo is the best honestly
The title is wrong it should be "easily 6 star"
Tnq brother ❤
omg thank you so much Judo! you’ve helped me complete all the challenges and got all the goodies. thank you so much, hopefully we can help you get clash of clans onto the big screen!   guys and gals if this video helped you out as well make sure to smash the like button, subscribe if you aren’t already for more tips and tricks in CoC. as a thank you to Judo let’s all vote for him via the link in description/pinned comment!
Thanks idol ur instructions are easy to understand and sooooo helpful keep it up
I Voted! Hope you win Judo, you deserved it!
Strategy for town hall 7 doesn’t work! I’ve tried it 30 times already and I can only get 2 stars on the second level. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Super
I voted for you Judo! ❤ Thank you SO much for these helpful videos!  They really are the greatest.

Nice Content
Finally subscribing and voting after abusing his help for years now💀

PLEASE PRETTY PLEASE MAKE A VIDEO WHEREIN YOU SNEAKILY CALL THE FLAME FLINGER A FLAME SLINGER🔥
Thanks 😁
Super pekka is not super anymore
Tnx bor
Thanks, Judo. I am late to the party. The last strategy doesn't work anymore as it is, but simple tweaking of that attack still works perfectly. Once again, Thank you!
The last one was actually hard even following what judo did 🙁 (I voted for you judo!)
Thanks bro bast videos ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Best COC guide and COC Youtuber. Keep up the great content!
Great detail. I watched others and couldn’t 3 star . I got all w your tips . Thx
You are the best
Thanks bro❤️❤️
Thanks Judo you made my day so much easier😅😎👌🏼💪🏼🔥
😥😥😥😥😭😭😭😭 my extra rainforestment not working
🤔Some abilities such as the pekka and cannon cart switch seem to have a bit of lag sometimes, causing the pekka to miss or the cannon cart to move within range of defenses first. It’s really inconsistent.
I really appreciate your doing this for us Judo Sloth may God bless you 🙏🎉❤
Thankyou
Kral amk
I started the game 3 days ago and now I have this damn
Ty for h the tur
Nice
i can't save the electric mode wizzard the big cannon always shoot .. why ?

Great guide helped alot thanks

Styck on bh9 cuz i was too lazy and wanted to watch how judo did the other builder halls
Judo Bhai big fan of Tamil Nadu you can teach and I win thank you so much.
Can’t pass 7. Guys judo made this game, all the money you have spent is in his pocket, yet he begs for more,
Thanks judo ❤
GG, thanks
I had quite some trouble on town hall 7 stage two. My battle machine can never take out the fire cracker and barely the toaster. Got 6 star by luck once. 😄 But the rest town halls are super effective and works pretty well
😀
Very nice video

Judo pro player🤝
Thanks Judo. Before attacking builderhall 9 bonanza challenge, let me vote you first. hehe
As per usual, a perfect guide : very instructive, efficient and funny as well. Thanks a lot !
Nice
Dunno why but i find his voice soothing
Thanks for the content! You’ve got my vote!
voted for you bro! always get my help here if needed!
Well some of the battles didn't go as planned but I got all the stars in the end thanks to this video
The update sucks
so uh... when will this challenge be over? im stuck on builder hall 4 and i really want the skin
Long time ago this game is my favourite game❤
🎉
The giant cannon always hits the wizard 😭😭😭😭😭
I cant beat t 10 😭
Judo Is world class 🥷Thankyou 🎉
Thank you. I have done my 5 accounts in 4 hours❤
Thank you judo a challenge
ty man! Saved me a lot of time haha.
Thank you Judo Sloth! Your strategies helped me a whole lot through that treacherous Builder Hall 9 of the Bonanza Challenge! I was able to beat Builder 10 with your strategy too, but only my Builder Machine was the lone survivor of that one.   I used Sir Moose's strategies for the rest of the Builder Halls from 2 - 8, but his spam attack strategy for Builder 9 just did not work out for me at all (I kept on failing to keep all my hog riders alive) even after more than 10 times of trying.  Luckily, I am subscribed to your channel too, and I know your strategies deal with more precision and focused attacks, so I decided to give your lesson a shot, and at long last, I beat this Bonanza Challenge! Much thanks again my friend.  P.S. I hope that your  smoothie container merch is still available for sale. I have to get my own Sloth drinking cup to sip on while I play! 😋
I have the delicious three stars on all the builder halls.......... all thanks to your Bonanza challenges tutorial.
Great video! Thank you!
You're simply awesome man! 😊
bro ur awesome
Wow u make it look easy,
Clash of Clans has lost all of the fun with this new update.
I’m so bad that I can’t even destroy bilder hall 2
Thanks
Very nice
Thanks

Thank you!!!
Thanks  bro
THANGS!!!🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😘

Great
Judo is there any way you can also include the time when your doing these attacks to help when to place troops
Putting my votes in. I really hope you won judo
You made it easy— thanks 🐲 I voted 🗳️
very nice and amazing
Thank for give me 42star i follow you❤❤❤
Thank you :D
Thank you SO very much!! You rock!  ALSO...I SUBSCRIBED & went and VOTED for you, as well! Which I'd like to mention...neither of those, have or would I, normally do!! However, you're very good at not only showing us how to get through challenges .... but also EXPLAINING how/why, which has definitely improved my game, since I didn't pay attention when I started and therefore was unsure of too many of my "troops?" abilities. Lmao   Anyway, ty again for all of your help!  (In this, as well as, another game that I play!!) Many truly appreciate your help!
Judo is the best ❤
Teşekkürler 👍
Was that Will Smith 😅
It's criminal how much value you bring while maintaining such a low subscriber rate. I've been subbed for years and just gave you my vote for mobile content creator. God speed, sir! 🫡
I like this update. Thanks.
Great Video I was actually able to play video along while making attacks in game much easier 😁 to get thru all levels.
Had to mess around with 9, it just wasent working over and over, I kept running out of time but the last tie I did it it was a blow out, true no contest, weird
OJ: noted
voting for you not because of clash of clans but bc you're the most helpful and the best creator
the early bases are very easy to 3 star, I did completely different strategies and got all stars up until the last 2
i cant 6 star th10 because of the giant cannon i can not even hold on to my pekka and just have a baby dragon and 1 wizard in the second stage can you please make a video again with the updated range of the giant cannon
thanks
Thanks
Thank you I’ve been trying to get a shovel this helped a lot so now I got my first hero skin and a shovel
Good gem
Ty for the guide!😊
Amazing judos

This new update sucks so much
I was doing  the challenge with him and i lost track once he is the clash flash
Ty
New sub you deserve 10M
very good. thanks. top top top 🔝🔝🔝
i love how clever the design of COC truly is. if you use the right tactics, you can win by a mile. if you don't, it could be unwinnable. i just beat the last one without even losing one troop using this video. meanwhile before this it looked impossible.
With this guide it was so fast and easy to 3*/6* everything. Thanks for that
Clas of clan God
Tysm for the tip i followed everything and got every star so tysm😊😊😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤❤
mantap tutorial nya asli dari pada orang indo

Just a note judo I tried using your method of 6 and 3 staring a different way possible and builder hall 10 I got done on my first try thx to you no attempts but bh 9 was a disaster
Thanks man 🔥🔥💪
Thank you very much Judo 'cause when i started playing bonanza challenge i always keep getting 1 - 2 stars only. Thanks Judo!

The last th lv 10 one doesn’t work
whats the name of the song at 8:04?
Anyone else notice that there are decorations on some of the levels to give you a hint of what to do? Like the archery targets on BH3 and the battle machine statue on BH5?
Just can't get 6 stars with the cannon range update
Judo thank you brother
Damn this event was so easy because of your tutorial! Thanks a lot
Thanks bro for tips
all of that challages is easy except the hall 5
some challenges or battle are difficult to win but judo makes them easy .Thank you so much as always judo we couldn't do it without your help. love from india !
Bro that slap😂😂
Achoo
Братка, ты тупо лучший) Тащишь офигенно) Надеюсь с твоих роликов и я смогу научиться ловить такие заносы!)🍈

Amazing

Thanks bro 👍🤘🏻
Thank you a lot @judo sloth
❤❤🎉
Do we get unlimited chances to attack??
SASAJI❤❤❤❤
Much respect for my homie Judo for helping the community when we need it!!
I have vote for you judo
Thank you love from Nagaland. Judo the best teacher i turn to. Voted for you just now.
one small mistake, at the BH10 the electro wizard on the right must not be put with a 1 tile difference but on the same line as the wall. Of course it's no big deal, this video was extremely helpful !
Done voting for you, goodluck judo 🎉
the accent , check his hardrive
Genius.
Very good
Bro makes fun of the zappies 😆😆
You are the king.
Thanks for your clear and step by step explanation. Voted for you.
On early stages, it took me few tries to get them right but on higher Builder hall levels, I got them first try specially following your guide.  Thankfully that the time from the 2nd base counts down as you deployed a troop so I can follow your guide on it too.  10/10 guide, really recommend your guide. Judo!
Voted for u Judo 🍻
Hi judo i am not able to collect gold and elixir from these challenges please help me
This really helped me get the battle machine skin thanks. Before I was struggling on getting 3 stars for the first challenge 💀
Very very thnx judi sloth master
and again you teached me something new, thanks a lot Judo you're always here for us thanks again
Yo I tried to vote for you at mobies but the stupid thing said my email is invalid. 15 years everyday email is invalid! Guess that is rigged. Enjoy your content. Just know countless people can't vote due to invalid working emails!  WTF?
Judo we need those base builds
Your the best judo 🤩
Ty judo i saw every youtuber video but they did different types but in town gall 9 everyones didn't work execpt urs
Ty for the tutorial for the banana challenges
I needed this for builer base 10. I 3 stared 3 and 4 from the right, but I could not duplicate it. Thanks for simplifying this for everyone it is definitely a puzzle 🧩
Congratulations mate
Thank you so much for this tutorial so I could get my shovel of obstacles thank you judo
You are coc king broo ❤❤❤❤

Thank you💪👍🤩🤩🤩
👍👍🙃
This is was helpful🎉thank you🎉🎉
Thank you so much Judo for this tutorial I'm donw with BH 9, and got the armored skin, I'm now aiming for the shovel
I needed a bit of help on bh9, but the rest I did all on my own. I was quite surprised. My attacks were almost identical to yours, especially on the first stage.   I did end up with more troops left over on bh 10, both stages.
OP
Dude, you give the best instructions!
Thank you judo!
❤
Ty for the idea igot the new skin. 😊 🥰🥰🥰
Te amo Obrigado,❤🔥💪

Thank you for assistance because in my "BONANZA's CHALLAGE" are all perfect, i hope you still gave more tips for us.
Judo your a life saver
This man is legend in coc 🔥🔥🔥
Judo builder hall 10 does not work, the giant cannon always takes out the wizard, show us what is happening instead of covering with graphics.  I need go find another tutorial this does not work for me
Thank you judo sloth
Thanks
Thanks man
Well, considering the real money I spent on shovels to be able to shift things around in builder base and then those items capability was deleted with this last update, I feel robbed.  Not only that but I think positive responses to this new builder base update is equivalent of a Ted Lasso result.  Irresponsibly positive response to a very crappy product.  There really isn’t anything I like about the new update other than getting the extra OTTO builder.  I imagine this will have an opposite effect for what COC was going for.  I will probably stop playing the Builder Base and just focus solely on my main base and the clan capital.  Saying this was a horrible update is too nice of a response.  Do better COC.  This is not better.
Your the best 😁
when will the challenge end?
It's ok Play model
Congratulations for achievement  judo bro....
Thanks for the note it really helped😊
Appreciate it, mate. Thanks to you I've got the new Battle Machine skin.

Thank you so much as always judo we couldn't do it without your help! ❤
So cuteee Baby Dragon tantrums effect🤣🤣🤣
👍👍👍
changing the displayed boss name to Peppino during Unexpectancy 3 was a nice touch
Damn happy for these guides because this new update blows even harder than what it was.
Here I am struggling at stage 2 lol 😂
I made it all the way on my own except I just simply couldn’t get passed 196% on bh10. I was so frustrated and gave in and watched this damn video😂
You are the best, man
Builder just got upgraded Thor mode
Thank you very much Judo.. ❤️❤️❤️
Excellent, Sir Judo. As usual, very helpful!
Thanks a lot I got that skin thanks to you 🙏🙏 Always appreciate ur video and i always used judo code whenever i pay in the game  Keep it up 👍👍
SUPER 👍 From Poland 🇵🇱
Thank you for being concise and helpful
I literally copied every single step and managed to get the 42 stars because if him i mean the real challenge is to know how u finish it no depend on others
Thanks for this. Even though I didn't watch the entire video because all I needed to know was how to 3* the Builder Hall 5 battle. All I care about is getting that Battle Machine skin. After that, I 1*ed the Builder Hall 6 battle, then somehow, I managed to 3* Builder Halls 7,8 and 9. Then 2*ed Builder Hall 10. But thanks again.
Fantastic work as always!  THANK YOU!!!
Really helpful and easy to follow. Very recommend
The update sucks
Thanks FOR the tutorial
I already tried getting the 42 stars of this event without Judo's help and surprisingly, I managed to get it while also doing the same strategy you've been sharing. Guess, I'm better than you Judo! Just kidding. All the way from the Philippines! Been a subscriber since 2018. More awesome content Judo! Much love from the Filipino People! Mabuhay!
Thank you mate <3
Thank you, Judo, my mission has been completed, everything is great.😊
how to get 6 builders.. plz tell me.. bro..
One of the worst updates to me personally
HOOOOOOOG GLIIIIIIIIDERRRRRRRRRR
Bro really likes to take out the zappies 😂😂

It would be cooler if Supercell made a practice mode for Builder Base 2.0. To show players how to attack with one attack strategy. Just like in the home village.
On BH10 if placing the wiz on the right gets it killed by the giant cannon, place it a tile to the right of the wall line instead of left, if it still doesn't work just move it ever so slightly to the right until it does
Thanks a lot ❤
Thank you bro
Ur videos are probably the most entertaining than other COC creators n more helpful
Thanks bro it works ❤😊

For some reason I felt bh-10 easier than bh-9.Thank you for the easy guide judo,helped me loads.
thank you judo
Judo. You are a legend!
Tanker for the guide judo becuase i only 1 star every single 1 of them
Thanks  judo sloth😁
Can I use this and translate in my native language
If you hold on the troops in the army bar they will get a rage for a couple of seconds. Also works with battle machine.
For the builder hall 10 I can’t get my wizard on the right to not be shot by the giant canon? Anyone help?
Thanks Judo
thanks judo
thanks
bro i cant clim them i done 3
Sir..... Please answer during research pet at pet house can I upgrade pet house without cancelling pet research....
vote for Judo. My favourite youtuber!
Thank you judo! i will vote for you
Funny how a coc content creator beat so many pubg and cod content creators in nominations
Great tutorial!😁 The sneeze at BH 10 got me dead😂
I Am Expecting You To Do Something Fun On The Stage If You Win
Thank you so much Judo!
Judo: "Easily 3 star..." Builder Base with 6 stars: "Am I a joke to you?"
good god those were harder than i thought they’d be
much appreciated
Sir can u bring some strong builder base layout after update? ?
Thank you  so much  for help us
Okay ok❤🤭+4…±
I voted for you Judo cause you showed me how to three star many challenges I couldn't do alone
Wspieram twoja gre dzieki za pomoc
thanks sir ❤ i am your big fan from 🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🙏🙏🙏
I voted for you bro, best of luck❤
Love you judo❤
Giant cannon range was buffed, ruins the BH10 strategy. Any tips for a new one?
Thanks for this great tutorial video love from bangladesh 😘
Your attack on builder base 5 needs a lot of work. It's way too sensitive to placement and timing
1:36 how did the firework disappear
Did anybody else struggle with the BH5 one? The instructions from Judo were easy to follow but that damn time limit kept getting me, lol. Ended up beating the challenge after probably 6 tries but yeah it was down to literally the last second🤣 then, BH6 was like a cake walk so it was a funny comparison
Did they extend the range on the giant cannon or smth they are always locking on to my electrofire wizards even though I'm putting them  EXACTLY where this tutorial put them
YOO Appreciate the guide 🙏
Best COC creator.
THANK YOU
Thanks judo, always delivering. Keep it up bro.
There you go, Judo! A vote in exchange for the 42 stars from the challenge!     Just kidding, I'd vote for you either way ♥ Keep it up, my friend! You're an amazing creator!
In the BH10 challenge, the giant cannon hits the electric-fire wizard on the right
Flawed on th10 electro wizard gets hit by big cannon in middle can’t make it miss
Tyty😊
He may be a sloth, but he faster than a cheetah
I hate the 2 base system. The only things they needed to fix was the loot system and being able to attack one after another, everything else just made it way too complicated. BB is supposed to be simple and fun but now I feel like I’m sweating my ass off trying to keep track of every ability at the same time
Man this video really did help
Whenever new challenges come, I immediately search for your videos ❤
This was very helpful. Thank you judo.
❤
You ruin my 5hr strategy which  can clear this base barely by this video💀💀☠️☠️
I love you judo Thanks for these
COC down for maintenance!!!!! No!!!!!
Thank you❤ 14:44
Right as I was doing this they call a 30 minute maintenance break
Your are the best you got me my firts skin in clash of clans for a hero thanks
I voted for you as my way of saying thanks!
thank you so much for this
Tip because when I placed my wizards they got shot by the giant cannon so I placed it a bit lower
The stupid ass Giant Cannon always hits the wizard without fail every single time no matter where you place him on BH10. Any getarounds? Edit: Ok, you just need to place it a bit further to the right.
Yessir les goooo
Builder hall 10 dindt work for me as the way in the vid. No matter where I put the wizard on the right he will be shot by the big cannon.  Got it done roughly the same way though just with 1 wizard less from the start.
You just saved a $1,400 iPad from going out of a 3 story window. Thank you my friend! XD
Abe is an amazing artist and I
Thank you so much, I was only 1 star away to getting the armor skin. It was annoying as hell cause I tried everything just to get that 1 star
This new builder hall is terrible ,,I have clouds ,,can't find opponents..once again poor supercell update ,,developers need changing
common Judo W
Tq for guide judo..❤
Where is the otto hot…?
lost both wizards and still got the 6 star
This new update sucks so bad
Out of respect I voted for you. Hopefully you win.
Update not working and the old is better
Ez very very easy
Me doing this in 1 hour finding out I could have made a video about it.
thank you!
I've beaten almost everything by myself, but 10bh was too hard, anyways thank you ❤
Judo sloth you are the best clash YouTuber in my opinion
W Judo
step 1: get the game not to freeze or crash
So well explained I walked Roight thru it!! Thanks Judo, You The Mayn!!
What is the 28 star gift?
ur so goated
Thank you so much
I had got maintenance  brake 😢
Excellent video! Really helpful!
in bh10 i cant get it to work. when going to second stage i only have battle machine, <10% hp pekka, and baby dragon
I miss the old Clash of Clans 💔
Builder Base didn’t need to be changed like this. I enjoyed logging on everyday for 3 attacks with loot, using my cannons, archers. Now I have 4 archers, 4 cannons/mortars? Builder base was nice and simple but now it feels like I have to put in so much more time to this part of the game everyday. All they needed to do was add a new troop and add another builder hall upgrade. Now all of our stuff is split in half? I’ve always like Clash updates but this one feels like it’s so unnecessary
Thanks
Uhhh i cant Tap my boxer Giant  Iam on Builder Hall 6
Judo at bb 10 when I deploy the elektrofire wizard the bud Canon notice it and attacks it. What should I do?😢
How is the giant canon on bh10 not hitting the wizard, mine always dies
♥️♥️
Eminem of COC 🗿💪🏻
Judo the Chad 🗿👑
BH10 one is broken
Otto took way long to upgrade judo's base  And that is why he's wiping that zappies instantly😂😂😂
Ι gather 28 stars im ok
I couldn't use the boxer giant...It wouldn't even clicked.
New update is the worst I will not play coc anymore 🤧🤧🤧
Thanks ❤
I dont know if the maintainance break patched it, The Builder hall 10, The giant canon starts to target wizard instantly as it is deployed and kills him
this video really helps thanks judo😊
Wllhi ninkan waa tuug tuug dhala wabeen tiis anoo lacag 500$ iga qaba block ona isaaray

Thank you so much dear judo with ur help i completed the bonanza challenge in both accounts of me
Thanks a lot judo sloth your the best.
This one clip is making $$$ 😂😂😂
Maybe you should call it... "Easily 6 stars"?
15:49 what sound is that?
The trick on bh10 with the wizards doesn't work anymore. I think they increased the range of the giant canon because it always gets them
Super bro love from Afghanistan 🇦🇫

Judo sir I need a help. The matchmakings taking so long to find a base. Is there any solution of it? I am in Iron III
Extremely helpful video, I'm a bit of a smooth brain when it comes to this sort of stuff, thanks a ton gamer.
Brother new clash of clans updates is come but now I open the clash of clan searching then a few seconds and automatically closed game . Please brother help me
Best COC content creator big up for u Judo
Bro full bug in builder base ask to fix the bugs If l click the builder base it came out from the game
U r too good !
Hello bro, sorry to bother. I have a massive issue with the update. I sometimes get matches really quick and sometimes it takes over 5 mins or it continues to search untill i get bored waiting. This issue is not involving only myself but my fellow clan mates from Mauritius. I tried to report the issue but i can't find anywhere to report it. Please can you make them aware.
Thanks!
Seen this comment on here a few times, but in the  final challenge the giant cannon is able to shoot the wizard, making judo's entire strategy not work. I have tried over 20 times and cannot get the wizard to stay out of the giant cannon range...YOU ALL HAVE BEEN WARNED!
I love these videos. For most players these challenges are dumb and too hard.
Full Support for you bro
I can't do myself so i visit here thanks judo😍🙏
Thank you bro
After the update, it takes a long time to find a base to attack on the builder hall side. Most of the time the search has to be abandoned.
Judo I will buy the goldpass with ur code
Need to fix this bug first i tried to find opponents but i see only cloud boring
amazing play through keep it up
Bro very nice video, I got all 42 stars by watching this. ❤‍🔥📈
I'm getting annoyed with the match making.. sometimes takes so long to find a match..

Thanks judo😂
new battle mech skin doing the spin move is by far the most goofy thing I've seen in a long time in CoC
How to use the second reward
Thanks for the Vid, always quality.  I line the new update but OMG it takes ages to search for a battle.
Yo man have voted for you👍🏼
Judo and the Zappys sure make a great couple 😂
is the battle copter bugged because it’s “tremendous damage” does less than a normal shot
Anyone else having trouble with the fire wizard on bh10? Mine keeps going into the giant cannon rage and goes down
New update 👎🏻
Thanks judo
Thanks Judo for not only showing us how to beat all of  these. But telling us how some troops work and giving us a some backround on them 🥰
Judo very very good at clash of clan and judo please add new lands❤❤😊😅
JUDO I NEAD HELP I CANT UPDATE CLASH OF CLANS RESPOND AND HELP ME ITS SAYING UPDATE IN THE GAME I HIT THEN IT SAYING OPEN ON APPSTORE PLS HELP I DONT WANA LOSE MY MAX THOWN HALL 15
I think Judo Sloth has to do "Best Base for Every BH"
i keep getting disconnected from the game and it kicks me since the update find out why that is please
Please bring back old builder house 😢
Voted 👍
Which background music is he using in the starting
Did they buff that big cannon thing on the right in TH10? I literally can't get my wizard to attack the clock tower while staying out of range of it
Ty
I Love this update so much
It would be much appreciated if you can bring a video on the new builder base designing as we have to rearrange our defences between two bases
Tyyysm I'ma use this to help my friends
I love you're videos Judo!
This new update is not good my phone crash it bro please fix it today i cant play game it lodging and auto cut not waking.
Thankyou you bro ❤️
Thanks sir❤
This is very helpful, and much appreciated! 😁
when i put the wizard on the right side of the BH10 first base attack the giant cannon attacks it. How do I avoid this? I am putting it in the right spot same like the video.
be great if i can find a game easily, but unlike before the update on a level 6 builder base, i can hardly find a game. Thanks for the second builder, progress is even slower now because of this new match making system.
Congrats for being in top 20 trending
THANK YOU!! I was bashing my head against the wall with that second challenge
Bro should change the name into judo flash
❤❤❤🎉🎉😊😊😊
Judo Y i cant log game back to  the home screen 💔
Great video I finished everything
All that practice and experience I had in the builder base is gone 🙁
How many days this event will be available
Builder base sucks. Still. Super cell failed.
I'll miss the competitive system 1 vs 1 of the builder base. Why did they change that????
Dai video takunu mudikamaatiyaada loosu match vittu valliya vaduruchu payithiyam
Why is game lagging after update.. 😭🎯🎮😞😕
Thank u af🤡
Thanks bro❤️
I couldnt play coc now. When i open it returns back to the system.what might be the problem? Can you sort? Or can u gimme some solution?
Pin this if you can! Do Not push too high, I’m currently in Ruby league, at 5780 trophies, and I haven’t found a match since. Because of the clouds!
each big numbers is represent the units of each troop and it's cap
Thankssss Judo
idk what i would do without judo
Judo loves to bully zappies.😂
make jaso co leader
Amazing video Judo!🙏🏾 Ffs I was stuck on that till I watched this perfect video💀
I’m a buildr hall 5 and I didn’t watch this vid yet but bro I got 4-6 stars and took about 2 tries for each
sad thing to me, I can't play COC no more because of my phone; laggy and storage shortages
Thank you Judo! I got all the rewards 🙂
Can you do a video on how to change the bases? Like how to move builds from one side to another, or just how it works in general?
Judo i need new base link
I do not play this but i like to watch
Can u do attacks for new builder hall & troops
The new update is horrible. We wasted hours and hours to get to max bh9 and boom update comes no packs or accommodations for our wasted time, but there is $100 pack that says buy me to get everything back we took from you. This update is awful. Me and my 11 accounts will no longer be putting money into supercell pockets. RIP BH
thank you so much man
Very helpful. Cheers Judo
Can't wait to see a best base layout for BH 2.0
done voting! thanks for the tutorial!
Judo plz gift😢😢
its very useful! thanks from Philippines!!
Brilliant. I learned a lot from this
Bro need help how can I recover a lost account  I didn't connect it to my email if there is any way I can get it back plzz help
It took me so long and so many tries to beat these levels. Might as well use this video to beat the last two.
You are very fast at posting for a sloth
Thanks a lot for showing us how to beat the Bonanza Challenges. I feel that since this update is still new many people were probably having a hard time figuring out how to use or get accustomed to the reworked troops with their abilities. I know that this video help many many people get 3 stars on all challenges in no time. On my behalf I kept getting two stars on most Levels, but this video really helped me get the challenge done with 3 Stars in under 20 minutes, without any problems, so one again Thanks!
Strongest work ethic in the game.
I'm done voting my friend!
Was looking forward to a builder hall update but this is a big L. Used to enjoy the builder hall side, just needed to be able to attack all the time and get gold. Might play it again some day but for now, not a chance. Huge disappointment 🫤
Bro created the crash during loading just so that we can easily enjoy the tutorial 😂
Zappies take it personal 💀💀💀
Any one else having trouble finding games in the builder base when attacking, mine just sits with the magnifying glass forever and never puts me in.
Thanks man, appreciate it!
Thanks man
13:53 Im having an issue cause my wizard on the right keeps on getting killed by the giant cannon. I have checked my placement multiple times, it doesn't change anything
Words cannot describe how long I’ve waited and him much I love this event
I can't play crash back every time 😢😢
Thanks you so much for always helping and giving us tip's in this game, love your videos
Bro when is the update
When doing BH10 how does the wizard on the right not get hit by the giant cannon?? No matter where I put my wizard he gets taken out in 3 shots
10/10 Judo, 10/10. You just got a new sub.
Haloo kak
I recommend trying to win this event by yourself. It's a great way to practice.
Bro it's bad after update i can't login
judo my words cant say the appreciation for you i love you so much thanks keep it up love the vids
Hi Judo!!! From Philippines🎉
Really good video
I just woke up and rush to open my COC for the new update, and there I saw, there was an event, and again rush to open YT and here I am, watching this amazing YouTuber, I really much appreciated your help Judo, thank you so MUCH💙❄️
Thanks for the tips your amazing I went and put in my vote for you good luck my guy love the content ❤💯
After updating the game ,its crashing from loading screen, My poor phone 😐😐
mine in builderhall 5 doesnt work
Voted for you Judo great work you do to make COC challenges easily smashed!! Thank You sir Judo Sloth 🤜🤛
Is it temporary?
I survived builder hall 6 stage 2 with only b machine and a reinforced giant And a few archers
How are you so good at this game 💀
I couldn't do the 10th builder hall at the same time as the video, sooooo annoying
The amount of people needing this video shows that clash is getting challenging
good job
Deserve the award :)  Hope u win
im so confused im placing my wizard in the same spot as judo but he walks into the giant cannons range and is quickly dispatched? can someone tell me if im doing something wrong? i think i got lucky but they finally went where they should have and now i just need to get lucky for my other two accounts lmao
my goat, builder base now is sooooo much fun
please tell devs to fix the crashing judo :((((
bro the bh10 attack does not work, I swear i've been re starting the attack for the last 15 minutes only able to get 5 stars edit: the right wizard always dies to the giant canonedit 2: got the 6 star W
You are an absolute legend. you kinda carry my account.
voted for you brother
❤❤❤
Judo is the Master Man😅
Anyone else having trouble updating? Anyone have any trouble shooting tips?
Bruh 197% on th 10
With the new update is rushing still the way to go?
Thank you Big Man!! I will always suport you 💪💪
W video
I am proud to say that I did the bonanza without any guidance
Great video Judo,wouldn't have completed the challenge without you.
thank you so much i could only get 5 stars on bh 10 it was so frustrating
I hate the new Builder Base.
What are those 'Personal breaks'? Must be the most stupid thing of all time, just let me fail the challenge
Thank you I just got it
ty
Time spent finishing Bonanza with Judo <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< Time spent trying to clear myself.. 😂😂 Kudos mate..👍🤟
TH9 has a bug or the fight is faulty, because that giant cannon always spots my electro wizard. In this video it doesn't but that is not  how it actually works when playing. Still managed 6 stars by attempting minor variations on the strat though. Thanks for the  guide!
Judo you’re the next clash of clans legendary YouTuber forsure, I really enjoy your videos keep it up 👍
PAAwerrr!!! 🙌
flawless
ty
BH10 strat doesn't work.
just osm bro
the th 10 one doent work really well since the first-stage giant cannon keeps killing the wizard on that side :(
Bro this Builder base is so good and it's super rewarding
thanks for always helping with these challenges judo! I always love it when you post a new video.
Nice work bro.❤
Thx Judo for making this video!
Thank you so much bro❤
Is it just me or if you hold down the troop ability it rages them?
Hello bro ..have a nice day ,i have a problem with builder base, I don't know how to arrange my base,pls help me ,make a video ( the best builder base 2.0,base 1to base 10
what song did you use on builder hall 10?
The balancing is asssss. If you put all of the strongest defenses in the first base nobody can even get past the first base
danke
I can’t believe they actually updated the builder base 😂
I CANT OPEN THE GAME AFTER THE UPDATE !!!
The editing is top notch The small detail take more time  Great
Ty bro❤
🔥🔥
Idk how but they made attacking worse in the builder base, 6 stars are literally impossible. Even more than 3 stars before the update. Either troops need a massive buff or the mega tesla needs to be removed.
Anyone else struggling on the builder hall 10? I followed the tutorial but my 2nd wizard keeps getting locked onto the giant cannon
Hi Judo I am having trouble getting used to the new attack strategies any tips
شكراً لك
merci beaucoup ça m'a aidé à finir les deux derniers niveaux
On your builderhall 10 tutorial for the first stage, the right ef-wiz keeps getting wiped out by the giant cannon no matter where i place it
Thnxx man it really helped u mever fail keep it up ❤❤❤
there is a throw vs crash in the game, what can we do?
The app crashing every 2 seconds, after the update 😭
Can't believe they didn't at least give us the rest of the walls for the home base let alone no defense upgrades
Thank you very much you realy help me!!!!❤
Not sure why but on the last base when dropping the wiz no matter where I drop my wiz on the right it gets targeted by the big cannon. I’ve tried dozens of times and can’t get it right
insane video
Thanks for the tips..  And much appreciated my friends ❤
Bro thank you, vielen Dank geile Hilfe 😘
42 stared all of them great strats
Thanks
Bro thank you! I don’t know how you beat the maintenance to bring us this but thank you!
On the builder base 10 the giant cannon keeps geting my wizard
I’m glad they made the battle machines 3d so they can get skins like the home village heroes and there will be some variety
thank you judo sloth
Bro has an addiction on killing all the zappies at the Otto hut at once
Bro has an addiction on killing all the zappies at the Otto hut at once
the GOAT
This update is pretty bad tbh
Thanks Judo!
The giant Cannon hits the wizard every time. I don't know how you didn't activate it.
Bet he's a dev
Tank you vor de vid
Struggling on BH10. My wizards keep getting targeting by the big cannon
Gonna be honest this update wasn't that great  It truly saddens me to say that
The matching system is a mess, i’m at around 4900 trophies, sometimes it takes me half an hour to find a base
Thank you so much
Dev: WTF!?
Today I stop the game...to many villages
The strategy for the first half of BH10 didn’t work for me. The giant cannon always attacks the wizard no matter where you put him on that side of the base.
got all the stars with your help bro, thanks haha
Will the obstacles in the 2nd stage respawn? They look similar to the rocks and i don't wanna lose them, haven't finished the video yet.
Why did they change the font of the upgrade cost 😂😭😭no one asked for it
love you judo
Update is booty
I think you mean 6 star a base not 3
The builder hall 10 one doesn’t work
Is anybody else struggling to open coc after the update? It keeps crashing
Thanks a lot Bro 🔥🚀😌
Thanks Judo ❤
que grande eres tio, un abrazo
Judo likes zappies
Thank you judo for the guide love your videos
thanks u so much judo
Supercell has made this so much harder.
for me on BH10 challenge the electro fire wizard on the right side was always spotted by the giant cannon and taken out even when it was in the same spot as judos 🧐
Me restarting the builder hall 9 challenge for the 50th try 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
This update is the coolest. The hate and childish behavior over this wonderful update is mind boggling. Thanks for the awesome tutorial, Judo!
Thanks judo appreciate your videos. What  do you think off this new update 🤔
Thank you, Judo, for making such amazing content for the Clash community.
The update sucks .they ruined my builder base that took ages to set up ...won't be playing this shxt game anymore
Bro when I join the game it's just my home village and I can't move anything.WHY?
Man, for the 1st part of the BH10 challenge, the electro-fire wizard I put on the right always gets destroyed by the giant cannon. Even if I put my giant early, the giant canon doesn't lock on it like what happens in the video. So the wizard always dies and the right part of the base doesn't get taken out and I lose too many troops to complete the 2nd part :/
this helped a lot. Love the channel and keep making amazing videos for me and the viewer's to watch
Thanks Judo as always
Can we actually do the challenges or is it also just a spinning hourglass with no actual base to attack?
I was surprised to find that I actually think the new builder base is more fun than the home base
I haven’t been able to attack yet. Keeps saying searching. Been trying last 3 hours
so cool to watch Judo enjoying the one shot zappies like a kid😂
Noice video bro.
Thank you
Is anyone else unable to log in after the update?
i voted for you last week. 🙏
Thanks for the help
Don't know about anyone else but for me (3500+ trophies) it takes forever to find a match in NEW BUILDER BASE.
Is the 99 dollar pack worth it?
My game keeps crashing when i open up the builder base 😔😔😔
I knew you would have this as soon as I saw the challenge
I think I preferred older graphics and mechanics, for me it was really nice. This new one doesn’t look like Clash Of Clans it seems like a fake game without Clash Of Clans Magic
bro u make these look so easy 😮‍💨😒
Thanks for the guide Judo
Thx
Please bring bases layouts
Can u talk more about the crashes of Coc and ty
Legend
well this update broke my phone now i enter game ant it almost instantly crashes game for my cant play
I was so exited for this update, and It`s finally here! And everything is awsome, but... waiting sometimes for more then 3 minutes is killing me
why is the builder hall 5 so hard
I don't see any challenges
I still can't attack but others can attack me 🤣
Why does it keep kicking me out of th3 game
You make it seem so ridiculously easy, but when i try it, it takes me 10 tries to get the strategy, then another 10 tries for timing
My coc isn't opening can anyone help please
I hope they add more challenges like this bc i completed everything in 10 minutes lol
Done judo , voted for you
Yo. In the second stage village it looks like they are hinting at a stage 3 in the future in the top right. It’s another rocky bridge to somewhere. Lemme know if I’m jus stupid or not
thank you boss judo❤️🇵🇭
Doesn't mortar mode have more dps? Why leave it in cannon mode in bh5?
Since I downloaded the update  Clash of Clans on my phone doesn't work. RIP my th13 village
Yeyy🎉🎉🎉
👍👍 best tutorials ever
Vote for Judo ✅
Judo the second the maintenance end: I AM SPEED
We need the best layot to the bulder base pls Judo ❤
Thanks!
You're the BEST Bro !!!
Thank you Judo! The God of Coc
The builder base 2.0 is fire This is so much more fun than previous one
i managed to do the builder hall 10 stage 2 without any wizards, but thanks judo very helpful tutorial
thank you judo!! needed this severely!
There's problem after update. After the update one of my glowing lanterns were in the way so I used shovel of obstacles to move it, after I moved it there was a stash button on it so I wanted to try it so I stashed it but I can find it anywhere is my glowing lanterns gone or is it just bug when you stash obstacles.
This event will go down in Clash of clans history
This is the first time im gonna try a challenge without help, just wanted to comment saying thank you judo!  If i do end up needing help I'll be back 😅
best guide out there
Gotta love Judo❤
Bro I was going to get on clash of clans but it said that I needed an update so I clicked update it brought me to the app place and it didn't say update so then I had to delete and reinstall the game but I remembered I don't have the acc saved so I just lost my town hall 7 acc
My Old barbarian statue is removed automatically
It's good, but we want to increase another builder, because one builder is not enough, as the levels increase, and its time increases with each level increase
Sometimes I forget clash is a mobile game lol
new update my game play Auto back  android  Ram 1 GB
New wizard is sick 🔥
Voted for you.. Great work as always Judo✌
Love you Judo, but man, I hate this new update.
Perfect.
Yo anyone having problems with the battle system bc for me it doesn't give an opponent when i queue up
Incredibly helpful and easy. Didn't have to retry on any of the attacks because of how simple the guides are.
I’m proud of myself for completing the first two without looking up the video😂
For once I think I'll try to do this myself !
thx bro . i got trough it easy thanks to you
Be waiting for speed run bh 1 to bh 10
I like how the Hog mountain scenery has now a theme. I was suprised when I logged in and heard music😅
My EF wizard on the right side is getting shredding by the giant cannon before he even shoots a shot... not sure why.
wait they had abilities ?! kekw if i didnt watch this id be stumpt XD
Can you make a Builder Base base guide like you did for the main base?
thanks a lot 🎉bro
Bad update
0:05 sickest intro so far with the cheers sfx lining up with the backing track
Voted for you my friend, thanks for the guide.
I can't stop bro...thanks bro😅
Voted for you of course. 😁👍
Omg this is soooo bad! I’m lost in the frigging clouds searching for opponents. This is so much more time consuming than the old builder base. All we wanted was to get loot on every attack. This is BS!
I can't stop bro...thanks bro❤
I can't stop bro...thanks bro❤❤❤
Thank you so much for this video!! 💖
Thanks 👍🏻
Im getting a "login error" after the update, I've  tried everything but can not open the game. Please helppp
Judo you’re the best content creator out there buddy. Here’s a video idea we need, but you probably already have this in the works, now with the re-worked builder base and 2 stages, we need a best builder base layout for each builder hall video!
Judo brother, I can't get rid of my judo players and many players in Turkey. When will Supercell fix this
Thanks judo for the help,I just want to say supercell has a lot of nerve touching my builder base and changing base layout..  I have spent hours and hours and months over  Ten years and thousands of dollars, with 3 accounts they think they can just walk in and juggle stuff around, maybe people should Start boycotting the game or supercell should just take over everyones account and play the game within the company and not open to the public... My money,my phone, my time! Doesn't =Supercells audacity to redesign my house!!
thanks for the help
Mine isn't updating. It's stuck at 99%
These withoit help were actually hard
I just voted for you in the mobile awards. Thank you for your awesome content, Judo... 😀
i love to try this but for god sake coc still crashing I can’t even open coc
idk why when i lost both of my electric wizards i felt that judo well yell at me lol  i managed to win anyway thanks judo! ofc i didn't forget to vote
Watching the video in laptop and doing the attack in mobile ❤❤
Can’t believe we got to wake up to Builder Base 2.0! Thanks Judo for all the awesome sneak peak videos and getting us hyped from day 1!!! Looking forward to strategy videos cause I need them 😂
It is just me or the attack loading is longer than usual
My life is nothing without judo
i need 5 times to watch the video and 6 tattempts but i got it
i want tutorials for this how to  be better in less possible time
I cant beat builder hall nine I always run out of time and If I rush with my attack everything dies at like 150 pecent
I hate how the new battle mechanics is basically going back to ancient days where you had to wait minutes just to find a base to attack
"The update is here and to celebrate... my wi-fi sucks"
judo can i ask? the new update reset for 6th builder ?  or change requirement?
at bh10 2nd wizard can be hited by gigant  canon
On BH 10 my wizard on the right gets killed by the giant cannon
bh 10 was little frustrating but i got it all thanks <3
i am following this to the letter and for the th10 when I place the wizard on the right side it gets targeted by the giant canon and I don't know why
Builder 9, why is the giant cannon not shooting your wizard on the right side? Mine keeps dying to it
good job mate
I love the update, finally the bb isn't about spamming anymore
Thanks judo for helping me out again ! without you it would seem impossible to do any challenge.!
Bro how do I share a screenshot of my base in the comments?!? Thank-you
Bro tells coc for updates
in builder hall 9 bro went HOG RIDAAAAAAAA
Can you make a video on what is the priority list about what to upgrade in a certain builder hall and after builder hall 6
I don't why, but no one talked about the wall changes in BH, they are finally, not pain in the bum, even when base building and when upgrading, it doesn't munch off your loot significantly
14 ads i swear
Battle copter is more weaker than minions i feel like
Judo ive tried 20 times my electro wizards keep getting targeted by giant cannon
After update I can't play the game it's hanging 😭 and crash 😞. My phone specification  (2gb ram & 32gb rom Android 9)
Currently experiencing lots of time on clouds while searching opponent to attack🥴
Am i the only one who can't find opponent?
my game is not opening after the update 😢😢
Gem to max?
I couldn't even 3 star bh3 by myself ffs 😭
Thank you soo much ❤️❤️
This Builder hall update is the worst update in COC history
I am stuggling with BH10 one, Wizzards keep dying in stage 1
Judo I think coc ruined builder hall as  they ruined the main village😢 . I am quiting coc now because of this worst update. Coc is not a good game now
Thank you
I was doing soo grate on my own but got stuck on th 9 got like 174%
Bro I can't open the game
What did you do at bh10? Why does a giant canon shot electro - fire wizard? I did as you said.
Thanks for the guide, Judo! Just a suggestion for videos like these, could you include an unedited segment for each stage which is just a full replay of said stage? Sometimes I struggle to keep track of the steps (especially at higher leveled stages with more complex strategies) during an attack because I'm busy fast-forwarding/rewinding to get past the explanation phase. Thanks!
Is this event will stay for more than 1 day?
thanks a lot I was only able to get 30 stars by myself
Sooo cool bro, it really worked 🙏 thanks for the tricks .
Could you make a video of the best builder hall base designs. If you have time
Thanks judo for the tutorial..
great stuff
Is it only me or did anyone else find it difficult to search for enemies in this new update?
You r amazing man 👏👏👏
great
waiting for judo to make a video on maxing out builder base 2.0😁
11:28 Crazy to think my man was like 200,000 subscribers not so long ago, now has more than ten times than that. Absolutely deserved, even if you won't be titled #1 mobile content creator, you are the one for the clash community
Dont forget to add the fact that clash of clans servers only allows one attack per few hours lol, trash update, trash managers, trash content..Like literally nobody asked for this update, but we all asked for more additions to town hall 15..Judo if you are reading this, stop ignoring all of the critics or else this game will die off soon and so will you
How Long will this Challenge Last? Cause i cant Play from monday - friday ?
Every time there's a challange I'm looking for judos video
My hero level 26 now need to make 2 heros to level 45 to get the 6builder  😮‍💨
Great video, and for that you got a VOTE 🤟
Judo: doing builder base attack  Me: unable to open coc😢😢
Thank you very much, it's always nice to get trough these challenges easier than to overthink. Even though i play this game for 5 years i do feel like a noob each time these challenges drop
11:33 proud india moment 2 indian gamers
After playing the new update I can say they really revived the second world they did a really good job
This dude is mad
its my birthday today and im so excited you helped with this event
Jod sir ❤❤
anyone else having trouble finding villages to attack? seems like i have to wait for someone else to also try to attack so their village opens up
Thx my man for the good guides!
Better than Kenny jos tutorial, 1st try with yours
Do they give you new challenges every month or is this the only challenge
Update keeps crashing
I knew i could count on you with my clash of clans challenge needs 😊
Thanks judo ❤❤ i will always watch all your update and all of your challenges its help me better thank you.... bonanza challenge done😂😊
The last strategy doesnt work bc the cannon takes our the wiz
Is no one with BH6 playing at all? I have been trying to find a base to attack but all I get are clouds.
Does anyone else feel like they somehow made the builder base worse?
Does anyone even play this?
judo sloth 2019 be like 10:41
Easy 3 star 😅 I always watch your videos like that before attempting to attack.  Your videos are just wonderful
Bro brought his phone inside a time machine to give us this vid absolute legend
So I've realized that I haven't seen anyone do yet if you hold onto your troops icon either be heroes or not but dont click it they turn purple like there's a rage spell on them I'm not sure if it actually makes them to faster but it's something you can make a video on @judosloth
thanks for your advise
I would be happy, if coc didn't buff their quality and makes me crash
No matter what I do in level 10 stage 1 I can not place the wiz out of range of the giant cannon.
I Have a Problem im doing everything correct But in the bh10 part the giant cannon keeps killing my wizard on the right🌭
Quality content bro as always
thank you judo!
Yangilanish kelib kutiga urdi
I love you Judo 💙🤠💫
There is bronze and silver stars what about gold stars are they gonna make 3rd stage in future
Absolute goated video
I don't think you realy need the wizards in stage 2 because both of them were killed and i still won @judosloth
What is the use of ARMORED MACHINE (5th REWARD) .......SUPERB AND EASY TO FOLLOW BTW
For how long will this challenge be live?
After new update I can't play the game. It doesn't load no more 😑😞😩😫😭 I don't know what to do.
Thanks for the shovel.
judo if you hold press on troops they will get rage just press and dont move
Where is the intro video 😅😅
Game is not working it is crashing
the real judo is developer
Need some attack strategy videos bro🤧
When will 16 town halls arrive?
managed to get my friends to vote for you, too bad clash of clans wasn't available to vote for
MUCH LOVE JUDO, UR EPIC :)))
Total bilder no 8 I'm so happy
lets see how my rushed Builder base handles this at th 7, level 1 battle machine lol
The new update looks so cool
Yo bro i have a problem after builder hall 10 update whenever I am trying to open the game my game is crushing even i update the game and uninstall and reinstall the game
Thanks
Nice judo❤
I like this update. I mean its not that much of a change but you have to be a little more stragetic now with your troops  than to spam like the previous builder base. Plus although slow to farm once the daily star is reached still dont have to wait an entire day for more gold or elixer.
Builder hall 3 has tips already on where to place for 3 stars…  Put an archer on each archery target  Put a minion on each floating lantern  Put the giant on the Boulder
thx judo i got the new skin thanks to you
my wiz on right is dying dure to canons
Battle machine skin is funny
Canon cart is OP
I am a proud voter for Judo.  Really appreciate his to the point and clear cut attitude as I'm always tight on schedule. Plus for like a hundred more reasons.  I will gladly  vote with all my ids if it's him.
Great video thanks 🤘
So, the update came today itself? I just downloaded today after a few months now, and there's some changes, wheew.  So, the bonanza event is basically us playing the builder base matches, ri8?
Best YouTuber😊❤
Judo on top. The best content creator for COC .you're the best my friend🔥❤
judo please make builder hall 6 2.0 layout 🥲
I dont play the game but still i enjoy your videos  you are great❤❤❤😊
Judo da 🐐
Big respect to Judo for always bringing out a tutorial when ever something comes out.
Loving this update! tho it is extremely hard to get more than 3-4 stars against other players.
Is the shovel of obstacles completely useless or is there a feature i'm not using besides just being able to move grass?
Idk how can you play Builder base2.0 when it was not release
This video was really helpful and a good introduction while playing simultaneously, thanks Judo
Problems: take hell of long time to find a match
I was very disappointed. I was about to get the 6th builder only 2 level upgrade for my BM then this happened. Been grinding for months just to get that 6th builder. Now I don't want to play builder base anymore for the 6th builder. I could have purchased the pack for builder base to get the 6th builder but the lack of information for the release date is what's holding me back.
Thank you so much!
We need base layout 😊
Thank you so much judo :)
Judo, can you do a video getting to bh10 on a new account like you do with th
searching for an opponent takes several minutes now, after the bonus
I LOVE how you're commenting while it's playing, and not pausing it. Real time lets us easily follow up as it's playing. No need to rewind and rewatch it
Deutscher hier ?
In 13:40, the giant cannon takes down the electro wizard. How to prevent that. In your attack that's not happening. How?
CUH🗣️🗣️🗣️ We Need Some Attack Strategies 🐔
My level 4 wizard on the right hand side keeps getting smashed by the big cannon 🙈 TH10  Great video by the way 👌 thanks 🙏   I got it now 😂
Thank you for the video!  Do you have any suggestions of what to upgrade first when unlocking builder hall 10?
I can't finish the bh 10 base. Only 5 stars gain
Thanks Judo, it was a great help!
Judo,we need some of the best attacking strategies for BH6 and above after the update.
Hei, I want to report some bug, its happen when i seearching for opponent and didnt find anyone, when i cancel, my base got att, when i search again and got enemy, my base get att again. So i can only att 1 time, but my base got attacked 2 times.
Thank you Judi ❤
Hay judo why when i Deploy my elctrofire wizard on th 10 the gaint cennon locks on him
Not to be a hater but this is a terrible guide. Half the attacks he shows are completely rng which makes you have to replay it over and over if you get unlucky. Maybe put more consistent attacks through.
Judo the level 6 cannons have a redesign in home village
Thanks for the video 💗💗
This update make me sad very much, i was about 2 upgrade to open the sixth builder hut , why is my luck very bad☹️
I am coc  remove  my phone 🤬🤬🤬😡🤮🤮 new update  is lol 😒🤮
This helped out alot and i finished all 9 levels , thank you
The update seems interesting but well I can’t play it since they only troop I used and maxed was hog rider (HP has be halved DPS halved 1 less per camp and ability reduced by 2 seconds) so there is almost no way to use mass hog anymore meanwhile most other strategies have been improved.
Helped a lot thanks
Your hacking
Eyo, I already found a bug in the builder base, when ever I attack the part where you cant place troop (the red area) I manage to place troop there
I watched a lot of judo guides and I myself have improved a lot,  I was able to beat almost all the challanges without any help and I gotta give thanks to judo for helping me improve,  hope you win for the mobile content creator of the year award,  you deserve it!
Completed the bonanza challenge today. Thank you so much judo sloth sir ❤️✨
Judo any tips my game keeps crashing after the update???
Clouds...
I used code JUDO and I instantly got Max Rizz
auf welches level geht der Außenposten
Very helpful
I vote for you because you’re the best ❤
Voting for you is the least we can do, Judo! Hands down my favorite Creator for everything CoC related - just as this great video covering the Bonanza Challenges in great detail. Thanks a lot and best of luck at the mobies! Vote is out!
This update sucks so bad its actually so sad. please revert to old builder base x
thats so good bro
Im experiencing a loading screen bug, i am stuck in the loading screen when i canceled my base already got attacked and causes me to lose trophies which is unfair
Thank you so much judo bro....i supported u in COC creators
bro fr we love u
My game is not updating my internet is fine please help
Judo, they should really add the last 125 wallupgrade for Townhall 15. Now the maxed out players are still stuck, even though there is a new builder hall base level.
Tysm
Exelent video brother,
Thank you very much I struggled in the th 2 mission 😂
Guys does the new update mean I can have 7th builder??
Good day Judo, I have a question. Do you think that the new Builder Base 2.0 should be rushed or not? Just asking for your opinion, thanks in advance and thank you also for this guide, it’s really helpful 😁
will you make a video about bases for th9 and 10?
only th10 doesn't work wizard gets killed by canon :(
Waiting for gem to max 😏
We need new bases for the builder hall 🔥
👎👎👎👎👎 worst update
can u do a video on the best base for each builder hall because of the new update please?
Can you plsss make a vidio were you Max out the 2 base in builder base
My game is crashing after new update Plz suggest me what should i do
B.O.B is now known as B.O.B the builder
thank you  first time i have doing 0% all base
I voted for my favourite clash of clans YouTuber
It's time to uninstall clash of clans 🥲
Can you still get the 6 th builder on the main village?
So for an update thats taken 11 months, all I get is 1 additional level to my builder base? and I have to wait till the end of summer for an actual update to play the main point of the game again? This is ridiculous
So fast
there's a glitch with my game that doesn't allow me to place the reinforcement troops,i can still best the levels without them but it's near impossible, does anyone know the solution?
I just started Clash after a few years of not playing it and it changed so much and the progression is way too fast compared to the early days and I kinda like it.  I started watching Judo a few days ago and now I can't play without watching him lmao
Ridiculamente a supercell Mutilou o jogo denovo, primeiro eles mutilaram o Royale, agora atingiram o clans, mais uma empresa que está sendo comandada por crianças que não conseguem jogar ou não tem sucesso com o jogo atual e resolvem mudar totalmente o jogo para terem Vantagens com quem tem jogado e se dado bem a temposzzz e como se vc tivesse um cachorro em casa, aí chega do trabalho e seu cachorro virou um hamster… jogo destruído
I have 5 bases and have to  these tasks in all bases😭😭 I gonna be bored but i need battle machine skin
11:30 Jonathan Gaming 🔥🔥
See that's the thing I was talking about on beacher's video you have two things the Builder can use as a weapon you have his normal weapon type which contain and then you have his concert but you just said if he's about to go down the attack in it will give you the health back for The copier you should be able to use both the concert and the battle machine at the same time because you have to builders
Thank you Judo😍🤩
I am facing problem post update. My screen gets stuck and i am not able to do anything. If anyone have solutions. Plzz tell I am really frustrated now
i guess i found a glitch , when i attack and return , and again try to find a match but it doesn't load and a magnifying glass with a cancel button is there and i press cancel and then i see someone is attacking , and until that person finishes attacking i m unable to find a match , why is this happening since versus battle is gone 🧐🧐
i got to the battle machine skin without any problems but if i wanna get that shovel i do need your guide and im very thankfull :D
Thanks judo, i hope you get more from god
W judo
Voted! I hope you win and keep up the good work
The update is great and I like the new troop abilities and I think there is changes in the grafics or something 🙂. But I can't even play the game anymore because my phone can't handle it 😔realy sad but for real excellent update
Thank god I was waiting for this vid to get uploaded
i misread it as "bornanza"
Judo can u pls make a best bases for all bh
Every challenge is easy when there is judo
Worst update
Can players who didnt get 6th worker before the update still be able to get the 6th worker or not anymore???
Judo sloth pls tell what connects builder base 2.0 with normal village now ?? No coin, no medals, no resources...still otto only???😢😢😢😢
give your editor a race judo being judo 😂
Finnally the time we all have been waiting for has come 🎉🎉🎉. Thank you supercell and Judo for the awesome guide .
I love that i get a clash of clans ad😂
Hello coc is not working 😢
thx for guide
thanks judo
Thank you very much for the explanation, you are a king
At Bilder Hall 10 both my Wizerds died at the first stage
What is the name of the song at 13:21?
Builder Base 2.0 is great but whoever made this battle machine model should face legal repercussions
nice video, cool stuff but the older builder base was better, now its looking like other bad game in play store, guess will continue to not play builder base
the wizard gets picked off by the giant cannon how did you do it?????
I don't unerstand the reason behind removing the Battle Machine skin for reaching Level 30.
They destroyed the builder base troops. Worst update ever. Worst matchmaking system. Nerfed the hog gliders, nerfed pekka, nerf everything
Am I cheating by watching this?
one question about the update: sometimes I can't find new enemys to attack... do you know why?
very helpful all done
how do you have 3 builders?
very impressive!
Thank man😁😁
As soon as I saw that there was a challenge i immediately knew a Judo sloth tutorial will be up
Can you make a video on best bases?
I love your videos thank you so much for help ❤🎉🎉🎉
The problem persists and I can't enter the game
It just feels too cluttered for me. I like the idea, but it seems like there's too much tapping and looking at my deployment bar more than enjoying the gameplay.
love the vids and the new builder hall update ❤ now the only thing that we need is new builder hall bases❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥 and attacking  strats.
You are my hero judo sloth btw what's your real name
Congratulations🎉
Song at 6:45?
The best channek
Challenge completed successfully 💯
I just entered YouTube to search that topic and your video was in the top of my fed😂😂😂
Sir please make best defensive, farming and war bases for each Tour hall please
In the south-west at the second stage, there is a bridge that looks like decoration, but in the north-east, there is a bridge that looks like it’s going to a third stage. Is it possible that this is implying something?
In the BH10 challenge, the giant cannon hits the electric-fire wizard on the right
Okay now we need best bases for every builder hall video
i don't know why but i placed the electro fire wizard in proper place but the giant cannon is always targeting it
I can’t do the last one because the giant cannon keeps locking on to my fire wizard in the beginning
amazing
In the trailer for billeder base 2.0 I noticed some little nods to older trailers like the hog rider seas have you wondered wats across the water just like the billeder base anounsmend trailer
Got stuck at bh4 by myself so I had to watch the video earlier than usual dang it 😂
Can I lament the fact that there is almost two times less loot per star bonus, and that the loot you get is lower compared to the previous system? Now they assimilated BH to home village, it is very time consuming (I could get over this one) but also upgrades are super long in time compared to before. It is longer than double, for those who will say "oh we get two builders"
Can say to me you mom pls
THANKS MR.JUDO THIE HELP ME ALOT😄😄😄
bro is the flash
Wait now that theres new builder hall should i max my bulder first before upgrading town hall?
Dude literally beat every challenge, edit and upload the video just as the update for the game was finished.
Sike clash of clans 😂❤ judo is the best
Voted for you
Bro on the bh 10 my other wizard is getting targed by the gaint canon
Let us thank judo for saving us during the maintanence break.
Who all are not satisfied with this updated?????
Where’s my armored battle machine price?
Should one rush to builder hall 10 if they're currently a builder hall 9 player, idk if it's worth it.
reason that 90% of the player base completes challanges and that reason is JUDO LEGND !!
I found difficulty for how I can access to 6 builder in my home village after update can you please guide me?
bro you posted before the maintance ends btw thanj you
I just requesting you to put a video of the new builder halls layout. Please brother 🙏🙏🙏
judo sloth is always here for help
Pubg player in South indian and America player
Bro you are a absolute legend, i feel like supercell is just so pissed because you figured out the attack strategies faster than the maintenance😂😂
Bro idk why my phone started lagging after the new update 😞
I see no one's talking about the game is crashing in the loading screen
Comment me judo 🙂
I actually won the challenge using this tutorial thanks judo
Ayeeee Iferg was my favorite content creator when he played old season from call of duty mobile good times 🥹
Bro i can't play clash of clans after update😪
Cannon cart needs a buff
This guy is the best if you have problems with attacks
how do you keep that second wizard out of range of the giant cannon? My wizard is down in the first 10 seconds because of the giant cannon
Thank you
Thanks bro 😎 . You're the best!!
New subscriber ☺️hope I get to learn lots of tips n tricks frm you my idol
Builder hall 2.0 has been hour for less than a day, I already hate it and have no reason to do it, so I won't. I already have 6th builder so it's dead content.
IMMA CHECK
Judo casually pumping out the best clash content on the internet 💪
yes
The cannon cart ability is really something to keep an eye on 😂😂
Judo sloth(🐐) the fastest man alive🗿
judo sloth hate zappies😄😄😄
I think they kind of inspired the ability from el primo
Judo i wanted to ask question. My laboratory troops are not upgraded to level 18 why?
boooring update 🤮🤮🤮
We cant use powers in 2nd base?
Thanks for the vid man... Youre the best Love from INDIA 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳

Bro what is this update🤢worst ever i think I had to leave coc again🙄
Amazing tutorial! Thanks for the skin 😁👍

I thought elixir would be tought to grind now but its gold thats tougher to get and elixir is easy to get
I came back my getting a gallon of water and saw an update and a new video for clash in a second.  My heart is about to explode
Most needed bro....❤
Love you  bro because of you i completed my BONANZA challenge
Bro my game is not opening
Done with the bonanza challenges. Thanks.😂❤
My brain is fried, sooo/tooo much info on the update. Thanks for the help though, judo.
Guys after the update my games been crashing. Just wanted to know if it's only me?
my wizard keeps getting killed by the giant cannon on builder hall 10 any fixes?
First time I've had fun playing the builder base in a while even though all my clanmates hate the update for some reason
Thank you so much for this guide, I wouldn't have been able to complete this As a builder hall 9 i'm having a lot more fun playing with different strats, instead of just spamming one or two armies  I'm forced to be smarter and more strategic, it's cool ! :D
The new update is so BS! I'm in Iron 1... It takes me around 5 attacks to make what I was making in 1 attack the last time... This game just got super repetitive! Gonna stop playing it now!
sir can you help me, my coc wont open after the uldate
Bro i was upgrading to bh 7 before the break so i did not get to build the healing hut🤣🤣🤣🤣
My coc crashed. I can't open it. Is it a bug or my phone is too old ;-;
Congratulations on occasion of winning the mobile content creator award of clash of clans bro ❤🎉🎉🎉
Damn it i forgot to screenshot my old builder base Any ways i can see it one last time
You might be limited with only coc but you are doing a crazy job you do deserve more indeed keep going my friend🔥💪🏽
judo is like one of the best if not the best coc youtubers that help with challanges like that
Thanks man
I’d love to use these strays but my game keeps crashing 😢
New BH10 walls looking nice
Your editor is good man!!  Well,it’s been about 4 years since I played this game,but still,this game is getting more and more fun and I think I will return to this game after 2 years or so!!Let's hope so...  (hhah,feels nostalgic! ~)
Thank you for this!! I did all but the last one on the first try!
bros videos are always handy to complete all the challenges
Fix bug please
And the update broke my game when I tried to launch the game it goes to loading screen and then crashes and it can't be a hardware problem when I have a S10 I was looking forward to this update but can't play it 😢
thanks a lot judo
I can't open my coc
what was the 2nd to the last reward for? is that a skin or something?
Thanks
when i updated may coc app it crashes it won't open..why's that?
Do they nerf hog glider,,, they are too useless now
My game keeps crashing If anyone know why it is crashing please help
thanks you😍🥰 TH9
Can't even login to coc
This is why you are the best COC youtuber I've been loving this channel and thank you so much for this I've been stuck at BH6 thank you 😊😊
5 took me way too many attempts
My clash of clans application is not opening
Judo is a icon for all types of coc players🔥 Love you judo🇧🇩
I have an question What happens with the million loot if you can't collect all of it? Because I don't  want to waste it
Judo sloth builder hall 10 spending spree
I cant get into the game since the update it keeps crashing 😭
How about you show us the best base layout for every builder hall include stage 1 and stage 2 for builder hall 6 and above also best attack for every builder hall
My man has come 💪🏻💪🏻
My game keeps crashing
unpopular opinion : Judo sloth has a direct connection to one of the people at Supercell that gives him the tutorials how to beat the challenges and they both make money off it which nothing wrong with it really if you think about it but in a way it does
Clash of clans is not open
I didn't like the new update at all😢
Thx Judo  this video helped me a lot
YOU WAS USING ELECTRO WIZARD GAMEPLAY FROM THIS VIDEO INTO THE OTHER VIDEO  HOWW? 13:53
Already cleared upto bh5 , i wil try the rest myself and watch the video after clearing them
This is the worst update of coc ever  The builder base multistage attacking system is no more fun but headache. This attacking system would be the most hated system by the maximum of the players. They can introduce simple, fun and more interesting attacking system!  The versus battle was boring but I think the versus battle was far better than this attacking system cz there was not that much headache and complexity!!
What is the reward for 28 stars?
This update IS Full of bugs, when im searching for an attack on the main base, the game Just closes for no reason, and now o went to the BB and a cant Go back to the main base, IS Just auto closing the game
It is way too hard to get gold in battles because I never get a star, and so for my opponents so I have max elixir
thanks
Bro game is crash
Coc crashing
Builder Hall Clan War❤
Bro why I am not allowed to go to Home village  As I touch boat it comes out of game

I do not have anything to say but I just want to comment so that it reaches out to other people.
Thank you so much. I was just playing the new update and the challenges didnt work so i searched and found the best yter❤❤
The new builder base attacking is brutally hard.
Is it just me or is this new update crashing everyones game?
tysm judo for the tutorial u helped so much
So im not the only one having issues… *It's a buggy update*  At first I managed to log in, I returned after months of break… so it's maybe the reason I was able to compared to others that literally not a single one.  But the thing is… I can't find a multiplayer battle… every time I search it returns me to my home village.  So after I finished things in Builder base, I tried to relog-in and it doesn't work anymore and says something like… “Personal break due to village not having a sheild for a long time”  Edit: Oh it seems it's actually a new feature, I'll try removing my Guard.  Edit2: Can't Open again
My game crashes
@judo sloth gaming help me
Bro please give us layouts for the new builder halls
Best layout for every builder hall level
Please I need help.....my clash of clans keeps on crashing after the update....I tried force stopping it I cleared my storage and cache...I even uninstalled and installed it nothing's working ...please I need help😭😭😭😭

Struggling with base 10 and the electro wizard to keep them alive for the 2nd base. The top right wizard gets taken out by the cannon ball but on Judo's it doesn't attack his wizard. Tried many times and different placements
the strategy for builder 10 doesnt work, the electric wizard on the right will always be in range for the cannon to attack it
I received update but I can't make attacks

When update come

Amazing video (even though the update isnt here yet xD) Also would be extremely awesome and very helpful to know the fastest / cheapest way to unlock the 6th builder (if theres a new method or just if using the current one is still best). Recently came back to the game so quite a while away so would find that really helpful when you have all the information for it <3
I still have half a hour
How are you so fast man Can't wait to see Builder Base 2.0

NOTE: They changed the range of the Giant Cannon so the Wizard on BH10 is difficult to outrange it. Instead use a Giant in front of the regular cannon to tank first so that your Wizard is safe.
