I have enjoy looking at the new William racing team new F1 car for  the 2022 season and one of the driver have a new teammate in 2022 as driver Alex Albon.
they dont have any confident on that car!! no one said Fast!!!!
Realistically they could be seeing 7th at best and 9th at the worst (although it wound not be to surprising)
MERC TEAM ENGINE IS DIFFERENT. AND UNDETECTABLE FOR FIA ABOUT IMPROVEMENT.
Fork latiffi
All the best and good luck Williams for the 2022 season. Would like to see you back in the top 4 of Constructor's. Sure Frank (RIP mate, good memories) will be cheering you on from above.
I would laugh if they get to the first race and pull a Ross Brawn and run off with the championship :D
21:52 "Blue." That's exactly the answer I would have given and was hoping someone would give.
The car looks stunning.... can't wait
Come on Alex. Make me proud of you. Bring Williams to the top
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
F1 isn't a beauty contest.......✍🏿
Goatifi
Latifi brain 🧠 don’t mention last year please
So glad Alex is back! There are so many likeable great stories in F1 these days that its hard not to be a fan of many drivers and many teams. I hope the new regs gives Williams a chance at the rejoining the lead pack teams! McClaren/Red Bull/Williams/Aston Martin would be my dream constructor finish haha (Sorry Mercedes!)
This is the time for Williams to find a way to drastically improve than the slump they have been in the past few years . They already got the money, good drivers & engineers to get this one this time. 👍 With the new regulations & the restructure of the team they did a year ago. Im certain it would be the right time to take advantage of all of these changes in the sport. I like what Williams CEO J. Capito did signing the experience Champions WRC VW guys to lead this project.
With everyone going matte, it’s nice to see glossy pigmented blues. It looks yummy I want to lick it haha. Good luck Williams and good luck drivers! Probably the most nice and decent pairing of guys on the grid and they deserve a fast car
Can defo see a 5th or 6th place constructor for them this year with some good points scores from albon and 2 or 3 for latifi
Open https://youtu.be/DSGWYAO-yOw
I would like Pietro Fittipaldi to be a driver for the Team, he is better than these two drivers
Hope that Williams have a Great season this 2022
I’m still confused, is Alex still affiliated with Redbull?
Let Lewis drive this FW44, suit him well, both numbers and color
Senna.
Thing of absolute beauty - totally rooting for these guys this season.
Williams Deserves To be Title Contender.   Personally I love Scuderia since I was born, however,  Williams Rothmans is still in my heart from that glory days.  Hope we enjoy a great season!!
Sko boys your time this year
torro rosso williams
Good luck this season Williams ❣ bring it home for Frank ❣
Best car, Albon fighted to championship.
Best reveal so far. Shame they dropped the yellow flashes on the livery but it looks cool. As Nicki and Alex said, it’s blue. 😎
Great driver pairing. Excited to see Nicki and Alex stepping up a level
Always a Williams Fan 🔥🏎
24:30 A modern integrated steering wheel or a red herring to match the red trim? For goodness sakes Williams, edit out the first 15 minutes of standby. The season hasn't started and you're already looking unpolished. haha
Porque albon esta mas negro?
Rully hope Williams do well ❤️ they deserve it from enyone out there
So happy to see Williams back in blue, with 2 excellent drivers
Sir Frank would not be happy that the Senna SS's are not on the nose of this new car. Very poor decision by the new owners.
Wish william F1 team with albon n experience bottas getting better for this seasons
Wow! Beautiful looking car. I'm not going to lie, I think it is my favorite looking car in the history of f1.
You guys better learn from your past mistakes
Looks great & fast!
Toro Rosso 2.0
15minutes of a countdown..... couldn't be bothered editing it out before posting... brilliant marketing
I feel this car could be the game-changer for Williams...the car looks sensational!  Everything is in place for a great season for Nicky and Alex to shine....onward and upward.....go boys!
The looks amazing - loved seeing Niki and Alex together. Sending the whole team congrats on an fab car and loads of luck for a great season.
Nice and to the point presentation and a great looking car. Best of luck during the next season Williams!
Car looks great 👌🏽 btw where can you purchase that jacket Nicholas has on?
ok the car was so awesome  the driver look so good , ok many point so nice this season
Latifi podium incoming
Albono!
ALBON!
If they used on the car, the color scheme they have on the shirts, the car would have looked great. Now, I am not enthralled. I still wish them luck, even if I was never a Williams supporter.
It looks like the old Prost F1 livery from the early 00's. Not my cuppa tea personally. Williams have always suited a predominantly white based livery best imo.
Starting @22:08, that is one of the best, most immersive launch videos that I’ve ever seen. The music, the story, the signification, the shots, everything was perfectly blended and executed to perfection. This looked like the production of a championship level team.   What I appreciate about Jost Capito, and the entire team for that matter, is that they acknowledge the past while simultaneously pushing towards a better future for all. The accomplishments of Frank and Head can never be forgotten. They fought for independence and never lost sight of who they were when they had every opportunity to do so. They show the blueprints of the historic FW14 with nuts and a wrench holding it in place, which gravitates towards the future FW44, signifying the bringing together of all that Williams is to  not only achieve excellence, but maintain Franks legacy of independence and excellence.  Also, this livery is unbelievably amazing when you look at it closer. The triangles showcase a “W” when you look past the shapes themselves, and the lineage, both past and present, is riddled through it.   Williams is on their way to success, and I’m so glad Duracell Jost and FX are heading this new era of Williams racing. Porsche/Audi, you better take care of them in 2026 and keep the name somehow, or I’ll have some choice words for you. Never lose the heritage, but keep progressing to a better future. Keep on keeping on Williams.
"Blue" LOL. We love you Albono!
I love the look, but for some reason it looks tiny
Love it Williams rooting you all the way this year
伝統あるウィリアムズというネームが残っていて嬉しいです。名門復活頑張れ！
Gorgeous blue, I´d have liked a bit yellow in there though :P
Its awesome to see alex back #geoooorrge
Rooting for King Albono 👑
What nice car!! 🔥🔥👌🏽
I want to see Alex race so hard!
Looks good!! Would have preferred yellow lines but still! Good deal with Duracell as well!
Albon is such a sad person...
Latifi never skipped neck-day that's for sure.
stunning car let’s wish them all the best for a great come back
Go williams!
Most beautiful livery so far! Congrats.
I love this car
Alex is such a sweet kid and a good driver.  Hopefully he has a good season,  I don’t want to see his soul get crushed again.   When it comes to speeches though, they make an extra good pair cause Nicky got the talking part in the bag.   But by far my favourite part was “Blue”.  😂
Beautiful car! Alex's neck looks a little small at the moment.
I’m rooting for you guys! Well, I’ve always had but I’m really looking forward to this year!
Das Senna Logo fehlt 🤯. Das hätte Frank Williams nie zugelassen.
I hope Super GT still has time for his GT7 content now he's back in F1
Sorry announcers but Williams is looking mighty good but mighty similar to Alpine unless Alpine go away from their blue. I wish them luck though!
Let’s include the 15 minute countdown for those who enjoy a good countdown...
The first williams car reveal Frank isn't here for :(
I was cheering on super max , but I really, really want to see a resurgent Williams and HAAS because the sport needs competition. Having only 1 dominant team and one contender team isn’t fun.
Am I the only one who thinks the Williams car looks like the  old  Toro Rosso car?
The car is stunning!! The best looking Williams so far!
Reminds me a bit of toro rosso but then again I love the toro Rosso livery
Where is the Senna logo?
Glad to see Alex back.
finally u got rid of backmarker white on your car.
Great to see Alex back. Good luck guys!
Look nice but they should had keep white blue and yellow
Love the subtle W in the design. Think that's the first car where the front wing doesn't extend beyond the nose. Will be interesting to see how the different designs work out for the teams.
So far the best Build-Up video yet.
Looks like a Tory Simtek
Latifi got a nose like Cyril sneer 😂
Nice to see SuperGT back!
Alex for the win!
GO WILLIAMS GO
Albon sounds scared, not like champion who want all. Latifi sonds good - will be interesting season.
Senna “S”??
Half of the video is countdown. wtf
Tallest team in F1, thats for sure.
Actually it looks very very French to be honest. Like Mirage bleue/rouge
I just noticed how thick Niki’s neck is. Damn!
From this season they removed the (S) Senna, shame ...
Sheez Albon with a Merc badge on his shirt, hope Williams do well this coming season
Looks like the old rb color torro rosso
Yes alex verry good saison for you man 😎👍🏾🥊
Good luck boys..
Well, you've already got the prettiest so far. Still, to quote Seb, " fast is beautiful" so let's see how fast it is and Latifi doesn't wreck it ;). Albon might get it in the points though if the car is any good.
Stunning car guys 😍
Wow.. Albon sees that its clean and blue... and errrrm it looks smart... and it looks like a fast racing car... the obervation skills have gone super human over the offseason..
Excited to see this pairing and new car on track ,👏🏾💪🏾
a brilliant looking car, lets hope they get back to their winning ways of old!
Ed China is looking good
Latifi for the championship this year!
Why was this video 30 minutes long?  Like 6 minutes was the car.
Albon is BACK
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, you fucked up the '21 season results!!!!!!!!
I would argue one of the best launches for the 2022 so far. Precision and to the point, with a great livery. And a perfect soundtrack and video production. Gives me all the feels.
Latifi is 2021 MVP
Absolutely beautiful!!!
I would never have mentioned the Spa podium. That said, the car is beautiful. I wish them well & hopefully a few podiums this season.
I'll miss Senna's logo at front.
The car looks GORGEOUS. What a presentation. Hope Williams has a good season!
This felt like a Poundland car launch
Albon mentioned reliability in front of his boss d'oh.
Latifi best friend of Mercedes
Gives me M Sport vibes, I know Sir Williams didn't end his relationship with BMW on the highest of notes, but I hope they reconsider in the future
Love the car, would have been great to have a nod to Sir Frank, lose the red and replace with Williams yellow! A little decal saying Sir Frank Williams?
Such excite 💪
One of the better liveries so far, only reason it's not the best is that the AT one was released before and holy shit does it look good. This one is a close second.
shame that frank has died so they've removed the senna logo from the car
Absolutely love it. Regulation changes are a great opportunity for a pecking order shake up and I have everything crossed that Williams can get several steps closer to where such an iconic team deserves to be.
Hope you have a great season!!!! nice car!!!😁🤩🤩
This livery is sick, Duracell partnership is lit 🔥
"George Russell and Max Verstappen are side-by-side coming out of Raidillon!" "...But here comes ALEX ALBON!"
If only Latifi was as good as his communication skills, he will be a tough driver to beat.
My favourite reveal so far, classy,cinematic and quick to the point. Love the livery too
Bit of a stretch “Amazing season” 😂😂
Good luck Williams, from México ,,, !!! Nico and Alex gooooo
Albon and Latiffi as drivers? They’re already shitting themselves.
Could have added a Duracell yellow stripe and gone full Williams 1993!  SO close!
The only thing missing from this car was a tribute to Ayrton Senna, given that it was the last team of the great driver before the terrible accident
Senna's killers.....
AS a American, it brings back a memory of the old Unser Valvoline era of the 80's-90's.  Good looking car! wish them the best
Damn that’s a good looking car
Starts at 14:55
Was that George on the car promo video 🤔🤔 ??
I hope the new sponsor DURACELL will mean the car will have more energy, if you know what I mean. Btw looks great!
ปีนี้ หวังว่าวิเลี่ยมจะมีผลการแข่งขันที่ดี
Half of the video is the countdown lol
I love the livery 😍
At the Start I thought: Where is Russell? xD
Why another FOM car here? They have a track ready version no?
Its so empty
Looks great for a show car, no DRS
Williams++
Williams Team all the best for 2022. I hope u people will get good season 🏆🏎💙
Can't believe you aren't putting the senna logo on the car because "we want to move on for the future"
At first glance, it looks very strong and fast.  Beautiful coloring above all!  Nicholas and Alex ... Enjoy the season!
Lets go, my man Nicky!!!
amazing! so excited for the team and seeing albon back. also can't wait for the duracell jokes. at least they didn't partner with the energizer bunny!
Great new livery! I am looking forward to the new season and seeing the team earning some points! Go Williams!!! Much love from the U.S. and hoping Sir Frank Williams spirit and inspiration will NEVER leave this team!!!
That is the mor Angry car of the season change thins ponture Pls!
Nice car
Love the livery 🔥🔥🔥🔥
damn clean livery, clean presentation. Good job everyone, have a great season!
Looks very similar to the Red Bull... Fake car I think.
Fantastic presentaion. A look on the history and a tuch of the new. Car looks great in the blue tones, no Duracel copper (strange) But looks great. Reealy hoping for you to get alot of points this year. and Lets get you back to the Top 5 in total with praying for podiums. Williams deserves this.  Good luck this year
Damn that was way better than the typical laser beam and smoke machine f1 car reveal.
Where's Alex's confidence
Looks like a old Prost car.
... WOW THAT IS GORGEOUS!
Best Livery hands down. Also mega props for not turning the intake openings into squares - they kept them round and sexy!
This car is very nice! <3 Better than the Mercedes from last year AMG AMG AMG... XD
Looks like the Prost AP04 from 2001. Love it
What a way to welcome Albono, by designing a Toro Rosso livery.
Duracell in this bizz??? Well shiiiizzzzzz...Game on!
Love the car🔥🔥.. So glad Alex is on this team.  I really believe he’ll scored some serious points for Williams this year
again, at a glance its the same car like the other teams...guess this season its pretty much almost indycar...
Model car,not real one👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
By far the best livery.
I am disappointed. I am old enough to remember 1986, 1987 ..... There will be struggle not to be in the last place.
no one finds its funny that its a 30min video with a 15min count down..... lmao
Ugly livery, sorry
Tell the editor that half of this video is a countdown timer.
Hope albon performs better and signs for some good teams
🇨🇦💎🇨🇦💎🇨🇦 Gone are the glory days of Monza 2004 🇨🇦💎🇨🇦🏏🇨🇦💎
Really like this, I'll miss the bits of white but the red is a fine addition. Can't wait to see this car fighting for points this year 💪🏼
Albon: can't wait to crash it
Best looking Williams since I started watching F1
Toro Rosso!!!!!!!!!!!! Yes Alex
Epic reveal promo
ALBONO
This season should be awesome ! The first three races will be the tale of the tape for standouts and will bring out true talents/challengers .Can’t wait!
Why are you doing it like RB…..
Let’s gun for the 2022 championship with GOATifi in the team
awwwww yiss, she pretty
Still miss Martini title sponsor 😢
They’ve got to stop being the first of the worst soon, i don’t know how they can sustain another season of being at the back.
The new car and livery look awesome, good luck for the new season.
there’s no “Echo” sponsor😕
let's go latifi 🔥🔥
Let’s goo Alex
Is they secretive about the car aero or there's nothing to talk about im worried.
Half of this video is the stupid timer count down….
Looks like a Toro Rosso
Absolute dirt bags removing the Senna logo.
All the very best to you all Williams Racing.
I kinda wish they had yellow on it like last year
Neat! 👌
this is the best blue car i have ever seen
I love the new livery!! 😍
Williams most definitely needs to get up the team charts in F1 but the competition is fierce. Hopefully they can find someone with the engineering magic Frank had to help them out.
GOATifi
I wish the sheep would stop going on about the livery, it could be painted 💩 brown for all I care! That isn't going to make the car go faster, it's down to the engineers and drivers to do that! I do hope that Williams have done their homework on the car and got their figures right this time and they can run somewhere near the front!
Hope Alpine has a lot of pink because we certently have a blue one ❤‍🔥
i hope the aggresiveness of the car will show its good results this year... Go williams!!!
Epic reveal and livery. Hopefully they can fight alongside Aston Martin
30 min video with a 15min run in........................
Al of this is futile! Ferrari will dominate  But I am curious about the pink color on this
Good luck Team!
Williams this year : Look at me ..i am the 'Alpine' now Car looks good ..hope they can score points this year
Partnering with Duracell does it mean it's the new Williams vibrater?
So, a Williams "Torro Rosso"... To me this is a wasted opportunity and I was expecting much more. :-(
I see a Toro Rosso, sooo, Albon helped To infiltrate Red Bull? Haha, but really, the livery looks amazing
Mr.Goatifi and Mr.Round from the Outside, sure it will be exciting!
🔥
Hope to see FW back in front row
Last years livery was a hundred times better, I get the direction but I don´t like it
Goatifi! The true WC21! ❤
She looks amazing, if the car is as fast as she looks... you're going to be fighting for podiums! And yes, i call the car a she because with those lines... it cannot be a he! ;)
The FW44 is one of the best looking Williams cars since the FW14 was launched in 1992.   I really hope 2022 is successful for Williams, definitely need to see you on the podium more often.
Let's go Alex.
Even now pastor still the last williams winner
King Latifi 2022 world champion.
I have no faith in the Williams team
It looks pretty racey in the new livery. Good luck for the coming season. I'll be cheering for Williams (I'm a lifelong fan)
#latifi for team principal.
I really like the livery but imo  It’s the best car yet
great livery guys....love the glossy finish and shades of blue..💙 For me this livery is at the top along with Aston martin..💚
The car looks great but, I remember the green and white 1970’s livery with Saudia
In a word: elegant. Keen to cheer this car (and all of Williams) on.
Same as what Red Bull did. Show the basic F1 Car with a nice paint job. The front wing doesn't have any adjusters.
Discount Alpine livery is Discount
I think with their lineup, they won't be as good as the likes of Hamilton or Verstappen but they will have a great season. I think they'll be contending in the midfield for a good portion of the season.
Good luck with 2022 season Williams.!
Is it just the libery?
Yes confirmed...F1 show car...it's just a livery release. They only altered the front wing.
Good to see Albon back, good luck!
Wow, so nice to see Super GT got his seat in Williams!
14:59 is the start of the video For those who are watching after the livestream ended.
Williams won some races in 1982, 1992, 2002, and 2012. I'm sure they will continue the pattern this year🔥
lets go alex albon :) car looks very cool i like the blue williams back to honor
Wow amazing livery looks like a reverse Brabham BT52!
Lovely to see you George 😂
Well...other than a touch up on the front wing they just painted the F1 show car...well at least it better be the show car because if this is their car, they're done.
Wow sexy but needs a little yellow. Just a touch
Car looks awesome
No Senna logo on the front like Sir Frank always did and preserved. Sad.
Oh hello, big latifi is right that's fresh
Video starts 15:00
Damn you guys did well with the livery
OMG you guys made ART !!!!
Let's go 💪🏼 ... P5 in constructors should be our minimum target.
GORGEOUS!
Please be as good for Mercedes as AlphaTauri are for Red Bull.
So Albon back at Toro Rosso?
I was told this would be a Rich Energy car.
I hope Albon does well with Williams
Im so hyped to see Alex back in f1 for the upcoming season 😎👍
Another livery reveal with a fake car :(
GARBAGE TEAM, Paid drivers, daddy’s boy! 😘🥴🥴
For a second i thought i was looking at a torro rosso livery
The hightlight of the video was the first 15min🤦‍♂️ oh and the livery this year was also pretty solid
What a beauty. It makes the Aston Martin look ordinary!
I missed this! I was sleeping for 5 hours shiiiiittttt
This is the most beautiful designed car of all the presented cars to this point in time.
Feels like a livery reveal not a car reveal
Have a good season, Williams.  Also, Haas, have a good season. Not to forget Alfa Romeo. Please have a good season. :)
Latifi hits and with that helps Max 2021, Now Albon is a Williams driver. RBR with 3 teams against Lewis kkk Let's Go 2022
All my wishes with Williams! I hope Albin shines through this season and will be able to prove his capabilities.   Best wishes to Latifi as well for the season ❤️
Oh my God!!! This is my favorite livery yet! I really want Williams to compete for the top this season!!!
No Senna S on the nose?
Toro Rosso is that you?!
I mean, it looks great, but doesn't it look fairly similar to last seasons Alpine?
Now williams is on the rise i want to see them on atleast midfield this season.
Wow..... That thing looks fenomenal.... Go Williams....
Idk why alex’s seem hesitated to say anything…guiltiness? 😂 I hope no shaddy bull’s business going on muahaha🤣
I didn't know Ed China worked for Williams
Idk why the blue reminds me of Microsoft word logo
How can you not love Williams? I wish these guys all the success
This is a  great livery...I'm thinking of Alpine new livery now!!
Albon... Again  Just a Showcar... Again
When u  realise ,u have 2 snakes in your team
Looks great , would have liked to see an actual race spec car rather than the standard mockup model
Looks like Torro Rosso
Toro Rosso but in 2022
blimey!!!!i frorgot that alex has returned
William will be G.O.A.T again if BMW rejoined F1
Needs a few thin  white pen stripe lines to give the other 2 pen stripe colors some clarity.
MANY BRITISH ENGINEERS WORK UNDER GERMAN OWNERS IN MERC.   HOPEFULLY PATRIOTS BRITISH ENGINEERS MAKE GOOD BRITISH TEAM.
Please let Albon win this year
mans said “so called dirty air” like it doesn’t exist
The new livery is GORGEOUS. Wishing best of luck for 2022
Remind me back to Scuderia Toro Rosso livery, the livery is similar but this liverys of Williams are great 👌👍
Alex albon let's get it
Williams had the ugliest livery last year, and for me this isn't the big improvement in looks I was really hoping for.  Very underwhelming.
An amazing season in 2021?!? 8th in the championship out of ten, lost George Russell and got bought by a venture capital firm.. I really hope to see Williams become competitive again, but lets not fool oneself about where Williams is right now..
That launch was so much better than Aston Martin, team members in Polo shirts and talking naturally not from an autocue. Beautiful car, let's hope it's speed can match its looks.
Some parts of the car remind sme of older formula 1 cars like in the mid's 2000!! Looks good. But can we fucking have V 10 back?
Short and sweet. Great looking car.
Wow, an actual  car release stream that wasnt 1hr+ with so much marketing fluff, and ego stroking. Nice!
Best reveal. No fluff, great little intro for both the video and the actual car reveal.
Yeah I thought Aston Martin made a serious statement with their look, but my god I seriously love the look of this car. I can only hope that the performance is also there to bring Williams back to prominence.
Lets Go Williams!
alexis and niki🤔🤨
Even though they did a Red Bull and showed the Silverstone F1 model, the livery does look quite smart. Keen to see it in sunlight. Hopefully the contrast of the blues is more apparent.
I hate when teams just do a livery reveal, it feels like a copout.  Either reveal the who thing or don't do it at all.
I thought the host was Edd China
excited to see this on track. wishing for Williams to get more points now Albon is back in F1. 2022 is going to be a great season
This livery reminds me of STR 14. Congrats, Alex. This looks like a blue fast racing car, indeed! R.I.P. Sir Frank, anyway.
I guess from this year, Nicholas Latifi will be the leader among the two drivers
Albon is back ya ges ya
I was hoping for a bit more white. Hopefully alpine will not do a full blue car as last year.
Kinda sad George doesn't get to drive this car. Give him a test just for old times sake Its powered by Merc after all
Well, since the side show is about to end and the racing begins, I am looking for the best and most intelligent responses to racing questions. Williams provides that with both drivers.
Go, go, go, go Alex Albon..... I Love Your Skill
Can’t wait to see the real car on track
why does the presenter look like edd china
Missed a trick the wheel covers not being Duracell copper coloured, that would have looked amazing and so unique!
Oh my god this is soooo good.
Sick of these liveried show cars...I want to see something that resembles the actual design like McLaren and Aston!
Half hour video to show a count down of 15 minutes!!!!  Love williams but, you can do better
Wow that is a dam nice livery, looks like an alpine or Toro rosso
fake car 👎
... prefer last season livery
Goatifi
+ 1 show car 🙄
Good Luck!!
is basically the concept car, all they revealed is the paint job. hope they will come back and fight for the title.
Love the colour. Sort of nearly like rothmans blue colour. Good luck Williams
The King is looking FRESH!
I don't know what I was hoping for but I feel disappointed
Boss is right, it IS a beauty!! And welcome back Alex!!
Very nice! AM, Mclaren and Williams have all nailed their liveries this season.
Williams lunch video the best so far. Least pretentious and just gets to the point. NO ridiculous CGI that has nothing to do with cars. Love the cool use of the engines for the song.
this is the best livery of all
Nothing says excellence more than half a video of countdown.
Beautiful livery, Valvoline sponsorship would make it an 11/10
No matter what, those new cars are much more beautiful than anything we have seen from 2008 until 2021. Let's hope they are better to race closely as the new regulations predicted.
That looks great hope it is as fast as it looks
So super gt got a Williams seat, its a start for his revenge against redbull 😆
F1 fans When redbull presents a show car :  what utter bullshit!!  F1 fans when Willians presents a show car : Wow this is brilliant!
Toro Rosso's soul living in a Williams body
Looks incredible
they race me so hard is back
Grande latifi 🔵🔴
I wanna know where is the hidden tribute Senna's S...
Red bull now has two more sister cars. It’s a bloody RB car
Red bull now has two more sister cars. It’s a bloody RB car
Latifi looks comfortable there and low key asserts himself as a leading figure.
I see that williams finally made a new wheel design
i really do hope they become a bit more competitive this year
Would love to see a few podiums from Williams and be regular in the top 10
Good Luck to team Williams this season.
Ya se pusieron las pilas los compas!! VAMOS WILLIAMS
George Lamb at the Williams launch looks like Edd China from Wheeler Dealers.
Let’s try racing backenders at the start of the season rather than at the title decider this time okay Nic
shit launch, crap livery on a show car
At least Latifi didn’t skip neck day
Williams Deserves To be Title Contender.   Personally I love Scuderia since I remember my self,  however,  Williams Rothmans is still in my heart from that glorious days. EPIC BATTLES VILLENEUVE, FRENZEN, COULTHARD,  SCHUMI (💔) , HAKKINEN....  EPIC CARS, EPIC ENGINES! V10 RENAULT!  Hope we enjoy a great season!!  GO FOR IT MAX!
So the FW44 and the RB18 are essentially the same car... lol. xD   Im joking lets go Williams! :D
this old vid
23:50
That's the reference design with a Williams paint job. Red Bull did the same. Show us the real car like AM and McLaren have done!
C'mon Williams F1, bring it on!!! :)
Torro Williams
Less White....... Something new...... I LOVE IT!!!
Só não gostei, pois tiraram a homenagem que faziam para o Senna no bico do carro
Latifi become a F1legend after abudhabi gp! Hope you guys have good year👌
6ix God Nicholas Latifi
good luck Williams! hope you have a wonderful and fun season ahead!
This is just fabulous!!!
No sé porque siguen llamándose Williams..no hay nadie de la familia que esté en el equipo..
i busted as soon as i saw this beauty
Williams have given up and are training their drives to just run very fast ;)
Wow🤩
De lejos se parece a Ed China
Yet another show car
I can just see the excitement in Latifi at the prospect of crashing this car and handing another WC over to Verstappen 👍🏻
Alex was right. Very blue.
Stunning! Take notes Scuderia AlphaTauri & Redbull! This is how you bring excitement to a team!
Electric Blue y Clean se ve súper bien con esas líneas Rojas. Espíritu Británico.
Hahaha doing a redbull huh
O mais bonito que vi até agora
Big blue Williams 🇪🇺🇪🇺🇪🇺
Lack of major sponsorships is still a great concern for smaller teams like Williams.  Otherwise, most of the fans are hoping that they can be regular points-scoring soon and achieve a podium as a surprise.
I like Williams Racing !
I wish Williams a really good season this year, it's so good to see the name still in F1 and hopefully they can claw their way back up soon enough!!
I believe this will be good season for Williams
So Happy to see Alex behind the wheel again
Waiting the anouncement Juan Pablo Montoya again in Williams F1 Racing Team.
Now this is how you do a new car instead of doing the same livery again like many other teams.
Freshhhhhhhh and Blue
2022.02.15.             14:30
Hahaha 50% of this video is the countdown. Hopefully they don’t wait 50% of the season to get started.
10/10
Same car that Red Bull presented exactly. It's a show car, didn't expect Williams to go the same route as Red Bull with a show car, understandable but little annoying. Nice livery though.
Fresh
I love this new Alpine 👌
Mazepin the BEST !!!!!!😬😬😬😬😬😬
LOOKING GOOD ALEX MATE
This better not be their actual car.
Looks stunning! Can't wait for the season to start....
Very, very Nice! It look a little bit like the old Torro Rosso.
Imagine Williams getting a podium or win this year. It will be marvellous 🤩
looks good! better than mcclaren.
Lebron james
Alright so the first guy Jos or whatever had no idea what he qas talking about. He has no idea about how far the work has progresses in the team.
What a beautiful car
I'm sure Williams benefits a lot in technology from Duracell...      said no one ever.
All the best for 2022 Williams forever #wearewilliams
Great work from the engineers. They manage to design the very same car than adrian newey did...and the FIA showcar.  Also...the livery looks very good and there is no way it looks like a basic paint on a formula one managment video game
vapt vupt
Looks like a toro rosso, I love it
Ligier 😳
hmm, not a fan of those disc wheels, and why do all the cars look more or less the same?
Alex and Latifi would look good in it❤
Confirmed that the car is powered by Duracell batteries which dont last long😂😂
Too blue… anyone else agree?
Albon is absolutely useless....This was a horrible decision picking him up. He's not that quick over a lap and he's almost as bad as bottas in wheel to wheel combat
Not the Real car! Just livery color on the 2022 official F1 ShowCar
Damn Williams if you have as good of a season as this livery looks you should be a midfield monster this year. I’d put this livery above red bulls for sure. Top 3 in my opinion love the blue.
Looking forward for many points this season The car quite look like 2006 version
I still think Williams made a big mistake signing Albon. They needed Hulk on this team. His experience is what they need and Hulk is fast as hell also.
Looks like the Red Bull, you good guys !!!
They don't deserve being in the back of the grid. They were once the ones to beat in Formula 1. The FIA ruined them and now they were doing it to mercedes giving max the championship.
Cool 9/10 Great Concept Livery and  NUTELLA LOL. Lets Go!! Williams Mercedes YEAHHH AND MERCEDES PETRONAS F1 AS WELL
"it's BLUE"
Lovely livery I’d put it in the top with aston martin and alphatauri
I like Albon but he’s not good on the mic. ‘It’s blue 🤣’ glad he does his talking on track. Hope this Williams brings them up to top of mid field!
Adalto Enerto!
ALBONNO🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🔥🔥🔥
Alpine running around too change their livery rn
Guys at Williams you know that F1 isn't a spec series right?
For Sir Frank Williams, I wish the team all the best and thank you for the 7-minute car reveal
Need to see that in day light to see how it pops up
Should've used more of that metallic blue up front.
u copied redbulls car? xD
I hoped for white, yellow and blue colour scheme with a bit of red just like Williams from their most successful era of F1
👏👏👏👏
keren, semoga bisa bersaing lagi di papan tengah lah minimal
The neck of latifi is massive
dont like the color
Nutella
It looks like the 2018 Toro Rosso
The Car looks tits! Honestly it looks like a very businesslike design! It's got all the right bits in all the right places. It's aerodynamics look very well devised! Save the Morris Minor Man! Lets go Nici and Alex!
yet again we saw a spec car, better that redbull though cz atleast the livery was new, feels like a waste of time 😐
Show car again wtf..
nice car.
Very disappointed to see another f1 authentics showcar...
Super looking car... high hopes for Williams - all time great team x
Good luck!
Livery launch.
Looks great and like it's taken some inspiration from the old Simtek livery, which is no bad thing.
Williams win constructors 2022
I love it, that’s a proper Williams!!
Where's is The "S" Senna??????
wheres the yellow😪
Nice Livery reveal! Hope to see the car itself sometime soon. Waiting for testing
this year's cars looks 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Looks good. And happy that Alex is back!
Beautiful car guys! Cannot wait to see it on the track. Best wishes for the season.
What a lovely car
So they’re going with a ‘British’ colour scheme but no white? Last time I checked the Union Jack had red white and blue? 🇬🇧 Definitely think some white on the livery would make it pop
será bonito se ganhar corrida. por enquanto é feio.
is this red bulls show car with williams livery? I don't think this is the real car that we will see in testing
Red is an unlucky colour for Williams
airbox/10
Looks good…let’s hope it goes fast too
I love the red for Britain!!
Well, that was a very low budget reveal!
Its a Showcar, o the real car? Very similary to the Redbull showcar
Looks like the toro rosso but that said i like it
Big Toro Rosso vibes
Looks like the rb18
Love the design!!
Wait, isn't in a repainted showcar again ?
W
That's one nice livery design hopefully it will be a decent car on the track because Williams needs a comeback.
Dark toroRosso
6/10
Williams has a great selection
Non sapevo che ritornava là toro rosso
Glad Alex is back, love that dude
Last season the car was prettier
Is a Fake car, a pity
🏎🏎🏎
why dont people like the livery? (in live chat atleast), its pretty good
Are Alex and Nicholas' driversuits going to look like Duracell Bunnies?
Gorgeous livery. I hope you have a very competitive season. Go Williams 👊
sick car ngl
Looks a bit like the showcar
Woah, that's beautiful 🔥
Jesus I'm going to get confused between this ,the alpine and the AlphaTauti
It's the FIA showcar
Looks like it should be sponsored by Valvoline
Damn was hoping for a blue and yellow scheme especially when they showed it in the reveal video!
Looking good
That's nice👌
''its clean ... UHHH ... it is blue '' LOL 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Another dark livery... I thought that the field might benefit from a bit more color.
At least they got it finished in time…
Love it 😊
Torro rosso car
Go Williams!!!
LATIFI GOAT F1 2022 WDC
Elle à une belle gueule, reste a savoir si le moteur va suivre ...
Beauty
Hope williams get a better season than this fucking lame paint scheme
blue
albon getting PTSD because of the toro rosso looking livery
beauty 🥶
TORO ROSSO 2.0
Another paper launch with the fake car. We don't care.
i was  there
This thing looks so sick 🥵😍😍
"Blue"
Toro rosso
I was really wishing that yellow was part of it
There really is a lot of wank in marketing... All they had to do was show that sexy car!
Beautiful 😍
That sidepod sponsor, I keep thinking it's "Doritos"
Spec car
George smoked Latifi every qualifying and race . It showed the talent gap
a beauty indeed
Is it torro rosso
LOVE this new livery!! Idk why, but it reminds me of Torro Rosso, except with a lot less Red.
torro rossi?
Mano sou fã de mais da f1  C tá doido 🤣🎑
Latifi will only be remembered for changing F1 history .. These undeserving pay driving..
Alboon said everything, blue!!
Plot twist it's the 1992 Williams
alex: blue
Good to see Latifi in high spirits, especially after all the criticism and death threats he received after last race.  No driver ever deserves to go through something like that.
noone is commenting
It feels good to see Albon back, I've been missing him. Thank you Williams for only 7 minutes until the car reveal!  it looks like Toro Rosso. WILLIAMS 2022 CHAMPIONS!
ratio
The hell is doing super gt?
atleast it wasnt about fashion (Alpha Tauri)
every single f1 driver: but uh... yeah
Good luck
Hamilton still wants albons rear right tire
nie z naszych jabłek:(
Goattifi 🐐📺
get this to 1000 likes and i will try to buy 0.00000000001% of williams
goat
Daddy has bags of cash. It's that simple.
They've done Latifi dirty: "Canadian Nutella lover and a new driver F1 Podium sitter and DTM winner"
GOATIFI + ALBONED = THE BEST DUO
One of the worst driver lineups I’ve ever seen
Latifi the real GOAT
Hope that Nico Hülkenberg comes back to F1 Next Year @Williams
🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴
cheese
Edd China is doing this presentation
Season launch = car not revealed
Black and gold please!!  (Duracell)
this is actually so cool
Siuuuuuuuuuuu
yay!
Yeayyyyy Albon is back!!!!
🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🤩
🅱️illiams
The real question is, will Hamilton's front left still take out Albon?
That would be great season for Williams. Well, let's go!
Coll
Latifi =🐐

Williams is going to have a brilliant Season💪
I Love WilliamsRacing & Alex Albon  @ thailand fan
we need slow mode in the live chat so much spam.... all F1 teams need to learn how to use youtube live as live chat is just repeated spam
4 minutes to goooo
Roses are red Violets are blue Albon is in Williams  So we should all celebrate 💙
I did not expect myself to make it to the live, hella excited
2 countdowns r u joking
Navy blue front
Do it.
¡'Like' si confías en la alboneta!
i expect nothing but a giant duracell lr6 battery alongside the creepy pink rabbit
Hoping for a real car! The leaks say otherwise!
Just hope the car looks clean and fast and not with a bloated engine cover like it had last year...
🤩 Williams fans 🤩
Hope that Williams have a Great season this 2022
My prediction is some lines of pink down it and the dark blue on all the promotional stuff
Super excited to see Albono back behind the wheel of a F1 car!
Ui
Plz don't look like female deodorant
Can't wait for this livery 💙💙💙
They’re going retro is what my bet is
Love it just watched a countdown to get to the next countdown 😂 good old F1 😂
