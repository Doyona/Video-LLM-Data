10:37 they did it 👌🏅
Back here after 2 years. A lot has happened since. And yet, Haaland is just as prolific, and he’s going to the World Cup. Henry’s wish for him came true
Is that a question ? Lol
And he is the World Cup with Norway!!!
and norway go to worldcup
And he carried his team to Norway with a billion goals
9:00🫡🫡🫡
1 Thessalonians 5:11 Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing.
halaand is not made for interviews
His accent.. If I didn't know any better I would have mistaken him for an eastern European.
That "As much as you want mate" was clearly out of respect to a fellow city player who never got to experience it.
RAGS UTDS TREBLE WAS NOT BETTER THAN CITYS WHO WON A DERBY FINAL 🏆🏆🏆🏆🦈🩸🩵🩸AND A FOURPEAT NEVER BEEN DONE ONLY BY CITY
Next? The World Cup with Norway! That would be his next goal. It's not impossible.
Be humble eh hei
wirtz are you watching you have been brought to win the treble
Well, I don't see him being injured, so he could well continue strong and break records for sure
Lets go Haaland!
Came straight from FA-cup "dry season for city
Haaland looks like an old aged khabib with long hair
"Vy are zey azking deze awkvard qvuestions?"
Anywhere else? ** 💀😆
2025 city 😢
Where is your dad 😂
Came to this video just after our arsenal game. So many emotions, so much relief, these players are written in history. This is what arsenal will never have, because they're not serious, they just want to have good laughs for one game. And they think invincibles is better than this. Champions of europe, you'll never sing that
Love Henry gently guiding him to give some credit to his parents. Nice that they help each other.
So many championship league winners ..im here by myself 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅 micah is hilarious
Steps to win the champion's league: Step 1: Be a viking
youner than mpabbe, but a lot more mature than mpabbe
Just when Messi and Ronaldo are going out. We have Mbappe, Haaland & Vinicius Junior coming in.
This guy with basically good and 'pure' values.... and how he approaches challenges is simply out of the world personality. Wish him alllll the best
as an Inter fan, all respect for Halaand and Man City but i have to say...pain is still there. So proud of my team, Amala! 🖤💙
Big move learning from the legend Henry💪🏽
1:01 omg the way the both move hahah must be that viking blood
Haaland seems like a very reflective and intelligent (also emotional intelligent) guy, great interview and vibe
Ele é o possoa mais doce 😂 tão sincero. Nada falso de ele. Ele é tão facilo gostar.
Is halaand more of Ibra or Thierry?
Try not to let Peter ask questions again , he's a lead balloon
It's funny how many times he reminded the panel of his age!! 😂
Lol, he was actually looking down when the question was asked: 'Anywhere else!?
Titi reliving his movements ❤
not a city fan, but how can anyone not like this guy. Class 100%
Micah was sidelined the whole interview
cant compare this guy with mbappe, he seems so humble and focused! hope one day he plays for madrid
Erling to Micah ' you smell good!' haha
Haaland and this new generation such as Saka, Bellingham... are not only talented but also humble and well aware of everything as well. They know so much compared to the previous gen.
Micah is that dude
Dude’s english is good
man what a player , coming from me being from Sweden , he is amazing. but whats up with all these awkward questions ? anything you would like to ask Henry ? , man he just won the champions league , even the treble , give the man some respect and space to shine , it is his moment  , stop trying to make it good TV especially when its not
He will cry in octobre when je receive ballon d'or 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🇸🇯
Haaland is the future
Smeichel shouldn’t be on this team
Hopefully he wins his deserved Ballon d'Or this year! Treble, top scorer in the Premier League and in the UCL, European Golden Boot... What else does he need? And on top of that, a phenomenal and humble human being... Or maybe a cyborg... Go Erling Haaland!
“small town in norway*
who was the other guy beside him his father?
Who is micah?? Why does he behave like hes a legend?
Man-CHEAT-er City.
Imagine Haaland and Henry in his prime as a duo 🤯
The loop jammed lol
The way Haaland was so focused and intent on what Thierry was telling him, makes me genuinely scared for this season. I just know he spent all summer working on that right sided run, right-foot finishing... Titi's right, we're all about to get absolutely rinsed by Haaland
Anywhere else? 😂
0:27
That was so much salt in 1 video
Trying to be inside the nba but falling way short.
wow haalands english is so good
Haland❤❤🎉
"I should have scored more"
Listening to Erling almost sounds as though I'm listening to Pep. Great team and master Coach.
man I love this guy
"THE JESUITS INVENTED FOOTBALL AND SPORTS 😮😮😮
Great watch here for everyone.... "FROM EVOLUTIONIST TO CREATIONIST" BY PROF VEITH POWERFUL TRUE AMAZING STORY FROM SOUTH AFRICA ENJOY 🇯🇲😀🙏🏽❤️
The face of football of this era! Global superstar! 🧘‍♂️
A great personality
Never thought highly of him. But after today Erling is a favorite of mine
Ahhhhhhh I feel sad for micha he is so admirable and humble look where his at and still puts himself to the ground. His las comment got me it’s ok mate you have made it in my eyes mr I get 3 haircuts a week mr. Look fresh all the time lol love and peace.
This is the most comfortable ive seen him in a interview
Still a child the little Erling
Henry calmly humbled him with the Norway question. The I'm 22...was so unnecessary.
3:35 FINALLY someone said it
I pray and hope he stays away from girls ... There's no limit to what he can achieve. He is a star!
So so lovely to watch men😊😊
Yes sir Haaland
I love these guys!  soo much better than sly sports and bt sport analysis... haaland loves city can see it all over I've noticed all the haaland to Madrid or anywhere else has stopped. Where's better right now? He's loved and adored by the fans and city, won the treble and smashed near enough every record if he doesnt get the ballon dior this year its rigged, got a bromance with kev and grealish on and off the pitch.. loves Manchester scene and night life guys genuinely loving his life... there going to be whinging we're sport washing and buying titles for at least the nxt 5 years at least 😂 signs a new contract the samaritans phonelines going to go into meltdown  .. i love city 💙😂
Like the fact that he asked advices to Henry, humble
3 Norwegian players? whom did Peter talk about?
What is Richards doing there?
11:17 seemed a little like a subliminal message to me 😅
The bit with Henry at the end shows he has top tier mentality. He’s going to get better and it’s going to be absolutely insane
Why was Peter Schmeichel trying to diss Alfie Haaland in front of his son, multiple times. Weird behaviour. Bucket Hat Pat the bitter RAG tw**
You can see why the Norwegians made good kings!
Very difficult to dislike him even as a United fan  , such a nice guy
« No more advice pliisss » 9:35
"I uh don't have a daughter" 👽💀😤
He really seems like a very down to earth guy, I wish him nothing but even more success.
micah didn't have to clown himself like that at the end
Peter just throwing every sly comment he could in scummy red
Yeah that was akward
Erling is a lovely guy!
Get Peter schmeical off the mic.
He's such a great, entertaining and skilled character. Love this guy
I’m a Man United supporter but I love Halaand, pure class⭐️
Clickbait title, but yeah it worked
What City did in the last month of the season was incredible, many people don’t realize it buh they were mentally strong, Pep built a real team
A charming youngster, and unbelievably mature for his age. It's so nice to know that God willing we'll enjoy his skills for years to come ...
Haaland who did sod all in the final
Erling's interview is more fun now than when he was at Dortmund. He's mostly got just one - liner answers of some sort. Great guy
My boy 🙏🏻🇳🇴
When I was 22 I was playing Sunday League. I was mostly on the bench. Twenty, flipping, two. The guy isn't human.
Humble haaland 🎉🎉
Erling Haaland is a true Role Model. Period. God, we need more like him!
Lol people seem to conveniently forget that Pep's 3 UCLs are fraudulent and tainted.  1. His Barcelona side of 2009 and 2011 were massively aided by the referees in getting them to the finals on both occasions. 2. Without the help of the referees, that side would NOT get past Chelsea in the 2009 semi-final nor would they get past the Arsenal side in the 2011 round of 16. 3. Arsenal were leading 2-3 on aggregate with 30 minutes to go before the ref decided to send RvP off for nothing lol. 4. Not to forget, Pep was also caught for doping as a player in Italy and then as Barcelona manager in 2009-10 for instructing his players to take special doses. Pep and scandals = a better love story than Twilight.
Just won the treble and he's still humble enough to absorb Henry's advice on his game.
5* weak foot Haaland would be OP
This guy is so expressive and colorful when talking about football. Definitely stuck with it forever🤣🤣
best striker in the world
This is the result of good parenting. I hope he breaks many more records!!
i love how he only respects HENRY cuz everyone else is a STOOGE
I like Haaland, but I wish he would stop saying he came from nothing like his team mates. Stones came form a council estate and was self made. Haaland's dad played for Man City already, his mother was a pro athlete and both Erling and his brother had a pro team looking after their meals and training from the age of 8 to make sure they also developed into pro athletes. It is not the same. Granted he has to have the mentality and the drive (which he clearly has as you can tell by the questions he asks the older pros when given the chance) but he was also handed the opportunity and resources to achieve his goal on a plate for him.
Humble like Messi n determined LIKE CR7. This boy will rule European football provided they get a good manager post Pep Era.
Dude is only 22 years old but he is already so matured!
*Erling got asked a question* Erling : NO
You can tell Haaland looks up to Henry.
The guy with the glasses is an absolute dweeb
The level of questions is embarrassing
What a fine young man...
Haarland is such a lovely soul❤
Erling is also a very likable lad. Congrats to him!
I only have one question: Score again when?
that richards guy awkward as fxk,thats a cringy a** brother 🥴😂😂
Man city needs to win the quadruple As Henry said
As a Norwegian, I can attest to this: Erling is very VERY Norwegian in the way he conducts himself. At the same time he is totally unique.. like nobody else!
Very humble and very likeable guy.
When he said about that free kick first thought. Shows everything about Haaland the Alien mentality😆
Messi and ronaldo gave us a long joy and entertainment, so I truly hope these players, such as halaand and mbappe and others give us at least some of the entertainment
This shits on any other platform
"It doesnt matter where you come from."  It does actually. And it really helps your ambitions to have a multi millionaire dad who can pretty much open any door who is obviously closed for most other kids. Talented than most, but lets get real here. This guy hasnt struggled in his life.
Akward. Plan someone questions in advance
I just love Thierry's reaction to the question at 8:56 , he was so surprised and grateful. Such a gracious man
"and real madrid won most of the time" XD he knows
Very humble guy, could teach Mbappe a thing or two!
Xd
What a nice, honest and down-to-earth sort of chap!😀
«You scored 52 goals in one season throughout all competitions» I should’ve scored more😂😂
Such a deep voice for a young face.
Haaland said why are they always asking these awkward questions 🤣 hilarious 😆 💯 he is already a living legend 😆🌟!
7:20 This whole interaction with Schmeichel is a bit weird imo.
🩵🩵🩵
what an awkward interview. he dont want to be there
I love this guy...so mature for his age, humble, witty, passionate. So glad he ended up in a good football "home", this City organization, at this early stage of his career. And he couldn't have chosen better teachers than Pep and his staff and teammates, to get the best out of him and to give him the life and sport skills he can carry with him into his future.
You cansense his hunger.
Next Ballon D'Or, him or KDB. Any doubts?
Erl.....Our very own techno Viking, with  better English than the Scousers
he uses No in the most wrong way possible
He never ever gave interviews like this at Dortmund it was always like why not 😉
Erling is so mature than the other clowns there. Henry has joined the circus unfortunately.  But Erling is so mature.
Such a shame that we’ll over 100 charges will forever taint city’s achievements, they will for generations to come just be known as cheats.
When Thierry was 22 he had already won the World cup, So did Mbappe. So take a back seat.
very good
terrible game
Erling Haaland is a game changer. He has shifted our expectations watching football.
Soccer Thor wins another medal…
Greed at it's absolute finest on display here. Let's hope they get all these honours stripped from them when the truth about their finances and how that money has been made gets released. Football should be ashamed of what it brings to the world. A couple of laughs and celebrations don't negate the extent of greed and inequality that it promotes.
I'm proud of my team, Intermilan 🖤💙
The future is Haaland and Mbappé
I don't think next year will not be the same for Haaland !
You know what this guys is very smart and have a great mentality, and for that reason above all other he"s going to stay on top for a really long time
Erling is the best in the world
Haaland will be a good pundits after retire
This guys mentality is astounding
As a footy fan he is what footy needs
The guy to watch all the time! Nice one
How about Julian Alvarez champion of the world Premier league champion FA cup champion champions league champion it’s just astonishing. How rare is that?23 years old
next GOAT debate between him and Mbappe
He's won a treble in his first season and scored 52 goals this season and he's asking an Arsenal  legend advice on improvement.  Elite mentality, and people have the audacity to say this club is ruining football because they actually understand that success is defined by trophies, and nothing else.
a striker can benefit of being a little more cold at the time of the finishing like cr7 for examplem high on emotions on front of the goal... idk
7:44  What's wrong with this guy? First he interrupted when Micah was trying to speak then he made this really inappropriate comment about Haaland's father.
Erling is  world class man
"so many champions league winner , im here by myself "  Micah 🥲🥲 you should stay when City offered the contract
11:40 "So Many Champions League Winners, Im here by Myself" 🤣🤣🤣
Haaland was actually listening to Henry’s advice…his whole face changed as he took in the words. You gotta love the lad 💙
An excellent young man.
Class
Haaland literally gives me Zlatan vibes 😂 you  just can't hate on this guy
nothing original about micah, fake through and through
Haaland- “felt the pressure in stomach” Jamie- “anywhere else” Haaland- “Why are they always asking these awkward questions”  😂
😅😅😅 I love these interviews with this guy...
awesome interview. Haaland seems very genuine
Did anyone find him a bit rude in this interview?
What a wholesome moment. It really shows how much of a big fan they are
People say that nobody will remember how you played, it’s the score that matters. I disagree. I prefer when the game is entertaining. I remember games where my team lost but played beautiful football and I could careless about the score, it’s the emotions those guys provided me with and I cherish that. Football is art.
Haaland didn't get many chances but he made sure the CBs stayed with him. Foden went through because they had to stay with him for example.
Micah absolutely begs it with all the Man City players and pep like he was a massive legend at the club but they just treat him like a fan boy
you are by a FAR the best sports magazine out there! watching you guys from germany <3
🤣🤣They are the best
This is the most intriging football interview I have ever seen
0.04 അമ്മേ
0:33
Peter and Henry next to haaland 🔥 he’s on his way to make a name for the next 10y
I love Mbappe but I have to admit that Haaland is way more geniune in interview, he speaks from heart without trying to control.
Erling getting advice and taking Henry's words on board shows the levels between Haaland and all the other strikers.  Humble, honest, knows he can do so much more and can achieve so much despite being in his early 20s: every striker in the League should listen to this.  Haaland and City take every competition seriously and go hell bent for leather for all of them not accepting 2nd place. Where is that mentality with all the other teams?
He's above Mbappe with a treble including the UCL, if he wins the Ballon d'or and just the Euros with Norway then this will be the quickest GOAT debate ever
As a Villa fan, it brought a tear to my eye seeing how much this meant to him. Congrats Jack 🏆.also, inter milan you gave your best and we are proud of you. Good job to you man city you also did well.Congrats on winning Champions league🥳🥳
I had never seen an interview of him he's a humble guy my respects for him
3:34 CRYINNNG
Not his big fan but he's very humble and willing to learn compared to other GOAT contenders Neymar, Mbappe
Ballon D’oor easy
Half of interview if not more speaking Peter, but CBS had no space for him in title😁
Schmeichel shouldn't be on these anymore. Very annoying character, constantly making quips in the middle of interesting stories and when it's Erling's turn to talk.
I think he deserved the ballon d'or this season , he make a incredible season ..ok he did not played well in this match but if u looking all , all the season he make the difference
Bro called Arsenal second best team 💀😭😭
Comments calling him humble looks a bit dumb!  Why will be arrogant hes making a way to become a super star! Let see 5years when he matures a bit more and becomes the main man of a team endorsing more big houses etc! Will then see if he humble for real!
Norway treble winners before Haaland, Ronny Johnsen and Solskjaer... and Henning Berg. Not sure we can include Nevland.
If he gets it on his right foot it’s game over, they will win the quadruple and erling will score 100 goals a week! 😂
Haaland being so direct and down to earth after enjoying one of the most meteoric rises in football history and playing a fantastic season is so great to see, can't wait for his next season.
What a lovely lad - parents will be very proud
Well, it's a good thing he ditched Dortmund, he's carrier wouldn't go far in that club. good for you young man!
Wow he has such a great AI implemented
I’m a united fan and this one hurts. But this guy comes across incredibly down to earth and I’m personally happy for him
Such a good lad.  Bet he's great in the dressing room
Asking advice from the legend is the most beatiful thing to see.
Pepe next year will not be at city.
when you see another pundit join Micah, Henry and Carragher it becomes so clear that their chemistry can't just be picked up. What a trio
Poor lad just wanted to go and celebrate with his teammates.
This is why in football priority is important! At this level money doesnt matter because the difference is few million dollars at best but the trophies you win will be with you forever! Mbappe could have won this before Erling and complete football had he chosen to go to Real Madrid but he bow down before the green bill and now will suffer indefinitely!
Man Haaland is so down to earth considering he's probably the best footballer in the world right now, won everything by the age of 22 (Club level) and is making stacks. Good for him! Fully deserves it
anywhere else? LOL !!!
You cannot dislike that boy anyway shape or form what a humble human being
What a Legend👏🏽
Big Meeks is only 34 years of age🤯 could've stuck it out on the city bench and won the champions league lmao imagine micah on the show having won the champions league
Love this man keep on doing what your doing Haaland
As an arsenal fan… you cannot take anything away from this beast…. What a player and grounded humble human being… and his only going to get better 😳
am i the only one who thought haaland didn’t speak english lol he gives me mad drago vibes
He’s like a combination of Zlatan & Ronaldo
Schmeichel was being cringe there for a bit 7:55
Schmeichel is very articulated. Composed. Reserved. Not an idiot. He starts with a short tecnical comment  and then sets up a question. Haaland is still a child.....hahahaha....hihihihi...  jævla forbana....fy fæn😅
I'm so happy to be alive and able to witness such a phenomenal footballer. Hopefully I'll live to see the rest of his career.
Micah and Carrager change please !
Ballon Dor winner 🫡
Ederson!
Schmeichel's insight was spot on. Haaland agreed and took it well. Pros.
This year's UCL kinda boring and uninteresting ngl. 1-0 fr.
my father
Burda is from Leeds
What an amazing dude!  I absolutely love Haaland & respect his humility and hard work. Not a big man city fan but very happy to see Haaland and De Bruyne win a UCL.  Hoping he pulls Norway into the World Cup like Bale did with Wales & Modric and Rakitic did for Croatia !
my autistic king for life
I'm here for abdo
Henry out here not caring about punditry just trynna secure Kate .... we all see you 😶‍🌫️
What an absolute superstar.
Micah: So many Champions League winners here. I'm here by myself🤣
This is what a Humble Zlatan looks like 😂
The world is a dark place even in football very funny interview ...   congrats to city 👏🏼
Poor Micah Richards 😂... Fantastic interview. CBS really winning with this panel 😅
Bruh talking mature for his generation, gratz! 🎉
Kasper schmeichel shouldn’t be on this again 😂
"Actually WHERE IS DAD???" :D
This guys a beast, reminding everyone his only 22 he believes fully he has way more to offer and we have no choice but to accept that reality his creating
Great player but it only took city 2billion pounds to win the UCL😒
CBS have to make a compilation of the best and funniest moments of this group this season, I haven't laughed so much at a group of sports broadcasters like this group
omg he has like a leeds accent
Great interview.. lfc fan.. well done Erlin
Wow.. like halaand start now..
Micah right at the end: “so many champions league winners… I’m here by myself” 😂
He speaks very well, well deserved and only 22 OMG And  Henry is right he could get 100 a season if he could finish with both feet
This is the norway
What a difference between him and Mbappe. Im glad its him lifting the treble.
I love this show
Schmeichel is such a tool.
him and his father are hilarious together 😂
Not a Cit£h fan but gotta love Haaland dude is so direct it’s funny.
Rlodri is them man of the match😊
Who is the African American lady?  I know the ex footballers of course
Did anyone see the India Tandoori in the background
You know, I am an arsenal fan and I don’t like them, but I like Haaland
That was a really cool interview
More professional coverage is needed for the US broadcaster of UCL. Kate Abdo should find another show/job to display her body curves, workout biceps, outfits (of low taste),... or something where no intellect/thinking is needed, etc.  Why is she covering sports  she does not understand a thing about (and this is going on for 5+ years) and not really interested in? Does not make a sense. CBS should find a better host that would put a better focus on match analyses, professional discussions, etc. Now, it is all turning to a show with non-stop outbursts of  crazy giggling (led by Micah), tons of ads and some stupid jokes. No ideas how to develop the coverage , better structure it , ad meaningful contents..This is a most watched competition that comes close to summer olympics (in total number of viewers). The UCL final alone is watched by nearly half-a-billion... Remove those hosts and commenters... Get someone fresh and knowledgeable.
What a humble sounding guy! Please don’t ruin him!
Great young man. Likable & he's a smart man too, will only improve further
Our robot 🤖 🔥
THOSE WHITE PANTS ????? 🙂
I love how he's no longer weird & emotionless in interviews 🤩
I miss being 22 haha
that yes from henry...he felt that
Haland haland
This guy is a mix of confidence and humbleness what a great personality he has.
this is the new Zlatan. No doubt about it.
thought he was from leeds
honestly, i love this guy more than Mbappe.
Haaland is actually very honest and open. He used to be so blunt and one worded back in Salzburg days lol. Grealish another who says what he’s thinking. Really refreshing to hear non PR interviews
Schmeichel is a cockwomble
Amazing interview. 🙂
Does Carragher still believe that Haaland chose the wrong club?
He sounded so English when he first said unbelievable lol
Striking Viking !
“Everything is possible No matter where you come from!” Preach Haaland preach
Brilliant post match interview. This is a supremely intelligent athlete going to get better and better.
That is the  Differenz beetween mbappe and him .. humble and Disziplin
Speaking for the Dortmund fans…we’re very proud of you, Erling! We’re so happy we were part of your journey! In fact, there are FOUR former Dortmund players in City’s squad….just sayin’ 😂  Big up to Erling, Gungo, Manu, and Sergio…you’ve made your black and yellow family proud! 🖤💛🩵
1:11 😂 he’s funny
Great past footballers but what arseholes
😡Don’t congratulate City😡Pathetic 🤢🤢🤮MBZ, the boss of UAE 🇦🇪 royal mafia, attended UCL final to celebrate his City team winning. So, no😡 we WILL NOT congratulate City😡  Just imagine Putin attending Chelsea finals when Roman Abramovich was used as shell owner. 😒
Ha poco da esultare è stato nullo tutta la finale
Schmeichel is wrong when he said he is the 3rd Norwegian to win Champions League.  Steinar Pederson, Henning Berg, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ronny Johnsen and John Arne Riise have all won it.
Awesome guy, great responses!  I thought this guy wasn't much of a talker😂😂
Wholesome ❤
Norway has the best chess player in history, and now it has the best current football player
Ballon D'or 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I just love how humble he is and how he try to learn from others, this is the secret to be the greatest. Good luck Erling you deserve all the Best
Ask TT if he ever said thise words to CR7😂. "Haaland" awesome player!!!🫡
Who is that women and why is she there?
CBS seriously need to get rid of Schmeichel. He's awkward, difficult, unfunny and cringey.
Great Guy Erling
that advice from my favourite Henry.... was just too good
These guys normally are the best entertainment but this interview was poor
Wow! I love this guy!
AI is really looking more human by the day
Very wise guy, respect. You Will be better and better
Interviewer: How were the nerves going into this game?  Erling: NO! I was really nervous.  Interviewer: You were or you weren't?  Erling: No, i was really nervous.  hahaha this fuccin guy
Micah was star struck..quiet as a mouse😂
WHAT A SEASON FOR HIM ESPECIALLY, he has to win the Balon dor now
poor micah: so many champions league winners, I'm here by myself
Honestly, what a great guy through and through. This interview turned me into a lifelong fan.
👏👏👏
I would give him advice to contribute to team and don't put pressure on him self about scoring he have to keep it in mind he will have 2 guarding him allways
Oh best man...haaland
If you’re an older person losing faith in this generation, I hope Erling can restore it some. Love this guy as someone who’s the same age, he motivates me incredibly
Imagine Mbappe being an ambassador of the sport over this guy.
👌🏼👌🏼
If she starts to run both sides we gonna watch out for him , cause anyone can send him a pass especially the straight ones he just has to turn run and hit ,,, I’d love to see it tho … United we need to do better 😢
Haaland looks more like Schmichael son than Alfie’s son 😅
What a lad 🙌🏻
Carragher, he’s becoming a proper tit now being a presenter. He’s over staying his welcome, week after week coming out with cringe worthy comments and nervous questions to players & managers.
reminds me of kimi at ferrari
Richard's how did he get that job ?
The stupid how does it feel to win question.  hang on I wrote a pre match essay so I could convey my thoughts properly.
When Haaland ask an advice from Henry, you know how good the bald man was. 🤌🏽
Er-ling heheheeeeee mah maaan!
Haaland is the player who doesnt have hater, now with the end of messi/cr7 dinasty, he gonna have the whole world supporting him.
I don't get it. When two championship caliber teams play each other, shouldn't they cause each other to not always play in an attacking, stylish or beautiful way, cause each other to have to defend a lot, force one to win the game with a bit of luck, force one "to win ugly"..?  Winning ugly should be the norm for the champions league, especially the final.
Harland is such a great player
It's sad that all these amazing players and coaches work for a club that can afford them only because they are owned by a country that sells oil and gas. This shows that the financial fair play system has failed and we need a new system in place
Henry reminding us all that being a great player, doesn’t translate to being a great manager. Or even a great pundit.
How can haaland improve. Idk maybe having a world cup appearance
No matter the success, fame, money and glory, they will always be looking for their dad. 😢
As a diehard United fan these past 3 weeks have been torture. I was really hopeful we would stop their treble chances last week and was in genuine pain last night. I really want to hate this guy but it is impossible. Absolutely incredible what this guy has achieved and utterly frightening to think he is still only 22. Just how good can he get ? I just hope Ten Hag can get in the players he wants and he can create a team capable of challenging this team but they are utterly relentless. Juggernaut of a team who I fear will steamroll the League for years to come. Their will probably be anomalies but by and large this side has everything it needs to dominate everything for years.
carragher is a strange strange man
Haaland was created to score goals, not do interviews 😂 good thing he’s just 22 we have so many years left of these interviews
I think Haaland will carry the new generation of football man with Messi and Ronaldo leaving Europe its now his turn to do amazing things
BVB fan here. It's so good to see him win such a huge competition. He's a straightforward and talented lad, hopefully, he goes on to achieve even more great things!
Appreciating the parents at such a young age is something else
that "dont forget im 22" was scary hahaha he knows it's not his final form
I love him.
Whenever he speaks, I completely forget how young he is…
Henry is awesome 👍🔥
CBS really made Erlin Haaland talk expressively?! This man only gives one word replies in post match interviews😮😅😂
Swear schmicheal asked the maddest questions.. 😂 tf is this guy on?
Great interview !
I remember when I met that shy boy in Salzburg with Szoboszlai, Okafor, Daka and other talented players. I'm so happy for him, he's still very humble, he deserves that treble even without being a City fan.
how are they keeping the guy for 11 min. let him celebrrate kmt
Haland give security to The club.. Without haland they lost .
This black dude with glasses is the most cringe mf in the planet rn
He was the reason this season ended up being different what a beast Erling haaland legend
erling haaland true masterpiece
Haaland acknowledging who won the treble first 👌 I'm United but respect to City and at least the treble winning stays within Manchester I guess 😂
I appreciate his honesty
Insane that he’s only 22
22 years all that pressure and expectation.  52 goals first season 🤯. Classless Peter making digs at his dad
Why did nt Carrager   mention Liverpool s  past glory s
It's not everyday some 22 yrs old striker put 55 goals 😮🎉 think about it .  Halland is 🐐
So humble. Know how to talk to people . He respects everyone and he is  king 👑 as footballer erling you deserve this champion league and you will get you prize soon which is ballndor 😊
He has definitely improved in his interviews.
Such a professional 😊
He is like Ronaldinho,everyone love him. Great player❤️
Haaland getting Norway to the round of 16 is bigger than Mbappe winning the worldcup
He’s human after all
He speaks very well, and he is funny
The last line " As much as you want, mate"
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Lovely boy humble very good for long run
What a class act this Haaland asking Henry for advice.... such a humble guy....
thats what we want LMAO
I don’t like Peter schmeichel. Maybe I don’t get his scandi humour but he comes across as a douche
All true football fans will agree with me in congratulating City for a tremendous season. What an achievement as a team!
This young fella is gonna be a legend of the sport in the future
The missing link.
Erling and Jack are the duo we never knew we needed. Both of them are just so genuine and honest and it is so refreshing to see. Love them both and love their relationship and bond together
Still be ugly all his life
He’s getting an English accent
man erling is a likeable guy.
Balon de Oro
This guy's gonna be Ibra2 version. Hope he doesn't change clubs like Zlatan. A robot he's steered the team to ucl glory alongside his star studded teammates. Pep effect.
Three English Finals  All WON by the English!  UEFA EUROPA - Anthony Taylor and Team (WON it for Sevilla FC) UEFA CONFERENCE - West Ham United (WON) EUFA CHAMPIONS - Machester City (WON)  Well, a good day for the Italian Football League! Despite the low funding and money spent per season, all made it to each UEFA final!
Live on television he asks Henry how he can be better with an honest attitude
Where's mbappé?
Great perspective for a young man.
They are so good !!! Micah Richards my Man !!!
Henry's a certified grade a Simp 😂😂
If we can keep him for the next few years, exciting times ahead!!  Like he said, he is 22.  Imagine him few years from now as he continues to improve technically, matures (not giving the free kick away like he admitted) and also learns dark arts(like Suarez).   Ohhh....goosebumps.
Just a normal 22 year old young man who is breaking records, winning trophies all in his first season! But so down to earth! It sure is great being a city fan! After 45 years now we are top of the pole! But Haaland what a fantastic player and man!
Peter is a knob.
“Sometimes you two are a bit awkward” the English accent really came out there 😂😂
He definitely deserves the Ballon Dior
Erling next time tell them you felt in your bones. Don’t look at your…. 😂 😂😂 but if you felt it there then that’s ok too. 🏆🏆🏆🔵💙🩵
So disappointed he will not play for England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 but I admire his passion to putting Norway 🇳🇴 in the football map. Jamie cheeky as ever. Always having a laugh watching you guys🩵🏆🏆🏆 Big Meeks. We did it baby🔵🌍🌏🌎💙🩵
Halland is a great player but Julian Alvarez is way much better than Halland. Julian Alvarez is tremendously much complete player than Halland. And it is absolutely hard to understand how come Guardiola did not choose Alvarez for this final instead of Halland, being tha Halland got to this final very wick and with wet gunpowder. Julian Alvarez: record: America’s Championship with River Plate, America’s Championship with Argentina National team, World Championship with Argentina National Team. It is pathetically ridiculous from Guardiola to incorporate a player with this record to be seated in the bench of substitutes. Very disrespectful from Guardiola to Julian Alvarez. Guardiola won this final just because he was a lucky arrogant bustard.
Where's your dad?
Schmeical is a proper helmet isn’t he🤣
Lovely dude
Haaland is the greatest of all time at his age of 22, hope next season he would beat whatever he had acheived this season.❤❤❤
Finally a CL after trying billions and cheating
This guy is going to Real or Barca real soon. Enjoy him man city while you can
"go find your dad"😭😭😭😭its so funny how she said it
Boy is well raised
Not only win treble but he's also the top scorer in EPL and Champion League. If he can't win Ballond'or then we know he has rob by fools.
If this man doesn’t win the Balllon D’or this year the worlds gone mad
You can tell he was hungry to score a goal. But that the thing that makes Him dangerous, every defender was focused on him the whole match. The gamr changed when Foden came on he runs at Onana was game changers cause Haaland had 2 defenders blanketing him
Is Kate a United fan? Her tone between 0:06-0:24 seemed pretty annoyed haha
Stud, love this guy
Why did he look at that 😂😂😂
He is already becoming the goat
As a Liverpool suppporter i wanted Inter to win,We will be back next season tho,But u cant not like Haaland he a great professional
Mbappe in the World Cup Haaland in the UCL Upcoming GOATS of these competitions...
this womans hair I'd possessing me off
with his achievement haaland will go to valhalla and reunite with his great ancestor.
He improved his english skills a lot
That was a great interview
Schmeichel's comment about Alfi Haaland... Not cool. Keane sent him on a stretcher and ended his career.
Mbappé is a beast but this kid is special.
Carragher a great pundit
Whereas most people will laud City for there attacking football and rightly so. Their defending however deserves immense praise also. After all they haven't concended more than one goal in any game since January which is simply remarkable. They are without being biased the best ever team in Premier League history so congratulations to them.
Who dafuq is the guy in the middle in the waist coast asking these wack questions?
What an impressive young man.
I really hope those PSG players who taunted this young guy with his celebration, are eating a fine helping of humble pie right now. Karma is a b*tch, and while this city team are around PSG won’t be getting their CL trophy anytime soon
Erling Haaland is so mature
What does Jamie say at 0:28 ??
Micah at the end bringing back the champions league banter :D
I repeat CBS got the best team 😂😂😂😂
Erling comes across brilliantly here - what a guy.
Was that India Tandoori in Norway?
2:26 THAT NYASHHHH WEARING NO.5 IN THE BACK ROUND LORD HAVE MERCY
Micah there to keep the show relatable and have 1 panelist with the same amount of UCL trophies as the rest of us!! love love
Win ugly? I ain’t a city fan but I’ve never seen city look like they where about to loose a match this half of the Season
Win ugly? I ain’t a city fan but I’ve never seen city look like they where about to loose a match this half of the Season
Haaland treble in his first season for City.Utterly incredible.Bravo !
What a great lad
So sweet
This guy's mentality reminds me so much of Cristiano. Keep it up my guy. You're only 22.
What an awkward interview but he handled it well. Apart from Henry they handled it horribly!
Give him the balon dor and video mbappes reaction
BALON DE OOOOOOROOO !! ERLING BAAALONNN DE OOOOOROOOO !!! 🫅🏼🏆
Thierry will be a good manager... very tactical
ballon d'or incoming
Embarrassed for Haaland!all he wants to do is celebrate the win!
Erling you can repeat next year. That will be an even bigger achievement.
You can't hate Haaland! 😂😂
Haaland the great
Peter Schmeichel is a weird guy
Haaland - is smarter than all of these guys haha
He seems as if he has a good head on his shoulder
Henry - huh?
"... so many champions League winners, and I'm here by myself" sorry Micah 😅
9:44 Ouuuuh Micah to Kate, Thierry is struggling 🤣
I never saw them inviting  Riyad Mahrez !!! He can speak English y know  ?
Haaland, putting in that subtle arsenal roast with that "second best team" in England. You could see a cheeky smile on his face 😆
Jamie - maybe be quiet
What a great guy. You just have to like him.
The next gen superstar is here 🩵🩵🩵
Peter Schmeichel "She was a professional Sportsman" LOL
"Can i touch it?"  "As much as you want mate"  Lmaooo
Is Jamie Carragher on the sniff? Why he been so extra lately.
Such a level-headed guy, I understand why the fans love him so much.
52 goals in 53 games this season... work harder haaland
CBS currently becoming or in the process of becoming the No1 go to for football. Henry is the class....Carragher is the heart....Micah is genuine and the entertainment and Kate Abdo is ALL of the above and gorgeous to boot. Their chemistry across the board just reminds of what football is all about.
Erling, welcome in the shot cast bro :)) you are perfect with them it seems.
A big thing about City is they're obviously a team full of amazing players but more importantly its a hard working team without any egos.
I never heard him in an interview. I Mike him, despite me being interista
You're talking like a G my man and not like a 22 years old young man. Congrats
Nah, bruh, now that he got that pressure of winning the ucl i have no idea what this monster will do, but i'm all for it
My god so much confidence and yet so much humility. This is really refreshing...
Definitely Balon D'or winner this year
I just love this guy. He's so blunt and realist. He's done so well and achieved big. Kudos
HAALAND was bort for this and boy has he delivered this SEASON
Titi look after Haaland said that they won it twice.. That look is from an arsenal guy
Who is the guy on Erling's left?
ALHAMDULILLAH congratulations man city  well deserved treble 🏆🏆🏆💙
HUMBLE GUY GREAT PERSONALITY AND LOVED BUY EVERYONE💙
micah 😂😂 11:40
Haaland is great to listen to. Him and Grealish are not the usual robots. Very refreshing.
Man this guy is so so blunt...😂😂😂😂😂 every sentence is blunt
Haaland aka the guy who disappears when the stakes are high
i already knew haaland was going to be star since his seasons at dortmund just has that dawg in him
Much better than BT Sport.
Man i'm really worry for Erling's hairline that bun seems too tight
Dude won the Treble at 22 and scored 55 goals. Already thinking. What can I do better? What a human.
Please f a come up with more allegations..cant thank you enuff
As a Liverpool fan, I envy you City supporters you have such a down to earth world class striker 🙌
broke several record, win treble. in the end, Messi gonna win Ballon D'or...
People bash Mourinho for winning ugly but every manager is emulating him now.   To us the fans, the trophies matter and that is it. 😂😂😂😂😂
He's a great Leeds lad 😅
it is crazy how mature he behaves at such young age, on top of a Champions League final.
He spoke good English now 👍
Goalscoring machine just the top 1% needed in the biggest of games they could easily do treble again next year
Congratulations 🍾   Erling Haaland 👏🏾
7:30 🤣
Micah: Wow! WOW! So many champions league winners here, and I'm here by myself! 🤣🤣
Micah is so irritating
Ederson and Ake! Walker and Akanji! Ruben Dias Johnny Stoooonnesss! Best defense in Europe! We're Manchester City! WE JUST WON IN ISTANBULLLLLLL!!!! WOAAHHHHH!!!! WE'RE THE BOYS IN BLUE!!! WOAAHHHHH!!!!! COMING AFTER YOUU!! WOAAHHHHH!!!!
Erling can now go enjoy his pizza
Congratulations City on your first treble.  It really and truly pissed of Mark Goldbridge. That was so enjoyable that you guys pissed off the whole United fan base
his personality, his mentality, his mood, this guy is so much of a professional, how cant you love this dude?
This attitude alone will take Haaland very far in life....Very grounded wow
The scandinavian heritage... Zlatan put Sweden on the map, Haaland put Norway on the map
Odegaard and Halaand world cup lets go
Amazing interview! A 22 year old amongst such men speaking like a real man amongst them 🫡
haaland, what a great kid, great maturity
“Where is your dad” 😂😂
This cast is such a pleasure to watch 😊
I love you man city you are great with my coach
Manchester is blue 🔵💙💙💙💯 champions thank you,City
Mission complete .. and then, welcome to real madrid
Im so glad he didnt score but Rod did !
Should be enough to win ballon d'or
Schmeichel is a terrible pundit
Ffs just realised Scott Carson has won the champions league and Zlatan hasn’t 😂😂😂
Wooooow so humble!Of all the things he could have asked Henry,he asked for advice!!!
Micah my guy 😂😂😂😂
Haaland could score more goals if he works on his right foot. Shooting from outside the box from his weaker foot would be a game changer for him so if he works on that and his dribbling, he'll be a much better player and will be scoring 50+ goals a season for fun. 60 goals even
This is why this guy will be better than turtle ninja Mbappe. Mbappe has an ego that is bigger than CR7's and does not deserve the credit he has.
Schmeichel is such a twat ain't he
See that's how big the world cup is, it's way bigger than the UCL. The end goal for any footballer and this is why Messi deserves the ballon dor for this crazy world cup campaign.
Carragher tries to be be funny and make  these idiotic comments.All this Paramount+ and USA viewing its  turned this guy into a bigger Twat than he was.!!
Thiery Henry just gave him the greatest advice in the world. And Haaland absorbed all of it. Humble kid, just 22, great perspective, and striving to perfect his play all the time.
Loved watching Haaland  interviews
What a nice human being an example to youngsters
Look at him listening intently to Henry’s advice. Soaking it all in.
Haaland is the most mature of the lot here. I never heard him before but he's an impressive young man, mentally. He might become a wonderful role model for younger people. I wish him the best.
u just can't hate this guy! as a United fan, it hurts that they got the treble but City and pep deserved this. well done
"Can I touch it?" "As much as you want" Came across a bit dirty lol
What a great and humble guy
'Where is your dad?'
Micah at the end: "so many champions league winners... I'm here by myself" I felt that pain 😅
Both ManU and Inter shut Haaland down. However, the cost to defending him probably created chaos around the box when ManC broke down the defense's posture.
2 ehemalige Dortmunder, 1 ehemaliger Bielefelder sind CL sieger👏
If UEFA wouldn't have have interfered, Napoli would have. Even the only team in Europe to give City a beat down, I ter deserves an applause,  because they are not really that good, as for City when you spend that much money,,this result is expected, sadly no player if there for the love of the Jersey, but for the compromise of greed, Forza ADL
His English got better wow
Love you erling
If I had never seen this man play a day in my life, just based on this interview he has won a fan here
👏👏👏👏🎉🎉🎉🎈🎈🎈🎉🎉🎉🎉👍🏽👏👏👏👏⚽️🎉🎉🎉🏆
He was nowhere to be seen in the final! What a shame
You literally cant hate this guy
Erling is the definition of money gets you a straight 10 bird hahahaha guy hit all the branches on the way down, but congrats
Istanbul ❤
"Anywhere else" 😂😂😂😂😂
Haaland is a phenomenal player but is also a lovely funny guy. Well done, Erling
Get him the ballon'dor its time to talk about it
'I was really nervous' 😁 'You were or you weren't?' ...'I was really nervous' 😑
Haalanf so good at 22, can still improve, funny abd seems so humble. Carragher tries so jard to be funny but its just cringe worthy, no self awareness or intelligence to realise people dont tune in as theyre funny but as him abd Richards are clowns.
Why cannot this country produce a footballer with extraordinary athleticism, exceptional skill, and fluency in English. Harland shames and embarrasses all of our overhyped, overpaid players.
Mpaypal punchin the air rn
Imagined if Norway brought him at last year WC
Thierry got offended when haaland said they're older and don't play football anymore so he chucked the world cup in there 😂
Lol, I think Henry may have inadvertently provided Pep with a new tactic.  Lol at Micah's last comment.
What a difference to BT Sport’s post-match interviews. Interesting questions, much better banter, and much better participation (rather than being dominated by Rio F.).
He’s the type of player that makes you put rivalry aside and hold your hands up. You can’t not respect his on the pitch prowess and watching interviews, not just this one, you can see he’s a top fella off the pitch.
11:47 Micah : So many champions league winners and I'm here by myself 😂
He looked down when Carra said “anywhere else?” 😂 0:20
God bless
Respect to Haaland. What a talent
I don’t know if it was just me but I couldn’t help noticing India Tandoori in the background. Btw, congrats Erling and Man City for completing the treble!
Where is that halland who gives one word answer 😂😂😂
Micah was starstruck😂 didn’t know what to say
Can we now talk about haaland with the balon d’or😩💙
His composure, his humbleness, his hunger for growth and development. Those are not the things you should see from a 22-year old. I'm proud to be a Man City fan!
22 years old with the maturity of someone twice his age.
52 goals and the first thing he thinks of asking a retired world class striker. Is how to improve.. This young man
He's very grounded and i can tell he'll go far because his mentality.
This is what happens when you put real, bayern, psg and mancity in one pot. The final seems one sided. City won and thats all matter but they didn't play like they had against the teams mentioned. We get a blaster of RO16, quarter final and semi final but final as all a joke to start with. If I wanted to watch Napoli, Milan and Inter triparty, I would rather watch Seria A or any two of them in final. Now I cannot decide , which Italian team was better this year among the three considering milan lost all to inter and milan won against napoli.
It hasn’t been that long since treble was won. Bayern 2020. Barca 2015. Inter 2010.  Maybe for premier league team.
i can see him playing fifa with someone and the only thing he says is "f#ck" or "sh!t" when conceding a goal
chelsea need a norweigan for a treble
What if they staged all this and  create this  character and they are AI robot
The treble in his first season ! Thats crazy !
Inter should be proud, dix Italians in their team compared to only two  English in City team.
Micah being the odd man out once again 🤣🤣🤣
Can I touch your medal?  As MUCH AS YOU WANT MATE  Damn Harlland is a True Alpha male 🔥
Micah is so cringe man gotta one of the worst rb I've ever seen
It wasn't the best of games to watch but winning was the goal in the end
his first season in premier league and he won the treble at 22 years old. he has a lot of potential
I wish I could give this video a love.
He's a breath of fresh air to this sport, and the fact he is only 22 and done what he has already, is mind blowing. Love his bluntness as well 😂 What a guy
He is not a Dancer.
Bro interview really improved hahahaha joke aside amazing player! Congrats
Haaland has a great personality. Really likable guy. He doesn't give the feeling that he is a great player.
Bro if Haaland could overcome his mentality, he would be unstoppable.
Now that is self-belief...not arrogance...very self conscious too in his analysis on how much he has to learn with age.  Young humble lad. Well done Erling.
Very media friendly....
Haaland is very respectful. 😎👍💯
Haaland is the reason why city won the CL. Just his aura makes this team perform 1000 times better.
carragher----scouse b----d
Coach Erling Haaland,he seems like genuinely lad,it’s been great season and congratulations;however,I look forward to my beloved Liverpool challenging you all again,hopefully soon.!😂
Why Haaland deserves to be on this list of awesome footballers?Buffon,Messi,Kante',Mane,Juan Mata,Fabregas,Rashford,Iniesta,Henry?You got it right!His humility!Of course there are many but these are the ones i can think of!
It's always fun to watch wjhen Micah is around.
Ballon dior in coming 🥶🥶🥶🥵🥵
Best champions league coverage out there. Expertise and Entertainment in One. Jamie and Micah bring the fun, I love to watch, Kate and Henry the class, this show deserves.
Henry is so awkward
Now he is waiting  for Ballon  dor ............ ❤❤❤❤haland .....
What a nice bloke, congratulations to him.
Haaland Haaland 🎶
BT sport is trying to compete with you guys 😅
Thierry Henry’s advice….he is right…the world better be scared he is heading towards R9 status
Im just happy they have learned to win whilst they are not playing great. That was the missing puzzle. Because you are gonna have game you will play now how you want.
Erling Haaland is such a cool guy, love his chill vibe in interviews, he’s going to be a huge football star for many years to come 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Anywhere else?  Erling Haaland looks down 💀💀  Haaland: Why they always asking these awkward questions 😹
Schmichel just killing Haaland for no reason sigh.
Haaland’s interviews are tooo good❤
Fans need to understand we witnessed Great era of the 2 Best players of the game  now we are transitioning in Mbappe & Haaland Era and hope this era will be great as well but never liked toxic fan culture .Respect every Player❤
Kudos to inter players also for a non 1 sided final !!
I miss the old Haaland when he gave 1 word answers. He's becoming a human and losing his Alien citizenship.
Wtf are these questions 😮
Carrick is such a dump simp ...
Dis guy really has alot for us in his generation
Happy for Haaland. Sad bc it’s City 😅
Anyone else think he looks like Tank Evans from Surf's up? 😂
love him
Just a reminder that they are talking about giving messi the ballon dor ☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️
"So many Champions League winners.. I am here by myself" Micah is jokes haha
I like how he didn't rise to Schmeichel's little jabs, also got a sense that Schmeichel was showing a touch of jealously....probably because he's comparing between what his lad's achievement against what Erling now done?
Thierry henry is so cringe
This team might go down as the best ever, so jealous and also scared haha
No doubt I can agree when Haaland said “we learn as time goes on”  Definitely I remember seeing him in 2019-2021 he has these awkward interviews 😂 He would give one word responses and smile so confidently  I love the guy he seems chill and he plays Minecraft? Aw man what a cool guy  “He just like me fr” 😎
Terrible interview
I’m happy for Haaland, but I feel like this is the end of an era. The Champions League can be bought now.
What a pleasant, polite and grounded young man. Good luck to him.
7:49 Peter, read the room. Why even mention that? Not the time!
He has to win balon d or
Erling please think on trying to train your right leg as Henry advised I think it's very important in your near future
What an amazing young man he is, speaks so well, brilliant player - The Striking Viking 🇳🇴 👏
I love Beyonce talking about football ⚽
I like man city because I know that they will win....
wait till he go to the world cup...
"All these champion league winners. I'm here by myself " Michah is a fool😂😂😂
was gunning for Inter .., but this dude is the real deal!
His English is astonishing
Wow only his first season at city and he's smashed through the goal record and earned a treble with an amazing team.
The Croatian curse is finally put to an end
I wonder how it feels to be Alvarez at this moment
Haalland good person emotional ,and 22 years old, hope few more to win
It’s acc quite sad how they all interrupt and belittle Micah
Wow you just can‘t dislike Haaland. Very grounded person and of course an incredible player. A joy to watch, even for rival fans.
Everything about his aura, playing style & mentality just screams confidence & self belief. All the greats in any sport possess this gene.
Kid keeps his nose clean and he could be one of the greatest of all time. He's already unreal at 22.
I miss merit based hiring. Those were the times.
Haaland is so wholesome
52 goals this season he is already a legend- I’m sure he will continue to break records one hell of a goalscorer
Cringe cast
Schmeical is so bitter😅😅😅
These norwegian players are so good, grounded, come from a stable family homes. Hence are successful.
Haaland is Ibrahimović but Pep actually likes him this time round.
3 guys 3 trebles
erling only one thing. dont get serious injuries that will slow down your career mate
He cant feel any emotions cause his a machine😂
Schmeichel trying to take a dig at Haaland's dad 🤣🤣
Great person =nice guy🎉
The best interview EVER❤❤❤
jack grealish biggest passenger on the planet
Back in my country. Everyone used to support man united, chelsea or arsenal. I was the only city supporter back in the 2000s, and it was very rare to meet another city fan in highschool or in campus.  All the ridicule, the mocking the hate i had to face from other fans has all been neutralized with this victory.  Thanks boyz for making that happen.
Micah at the end lol. Dudes a legend
Check the money
United fan here can’t hate him
Absolutely ghosted in the big games tho, still doesn't take away from the fact that he is the golden boot winner in both the prem and CL and is a treble winner and maybe even the potential winner of the Ballon d'Or all at the age of 22.
haaland needs a daugter
Look at the difference from cbs to the BT sport interviews instantly laughter and good vibes 😂
"Erling hehehe"🤝
as a messi fan he deserves the balon d oro👑👑
Haaland and Alvarez already achieved so much at a young age. All the trophies. Hopefully they don't lose steam by age 29.
I don't have a daughter 😅🤣🤣🤣😂
As a utd fan I'm quite sad our record has been broken :( but fair play to city they equalled our 3 in a row pl and won their first of many ucl and the treble all at the same time🤯. I hope utd can get back to their best so that this can turn into a best rivalry of all time.
If this man doesn’t win the balondor it’s a joke, he’s been an animal all season and he’s only 22. The team have almost adjusted to him and it’s frightening for everyone else in the league now as even thought he won’t score quite as many the team will be even more ruthless
Just gotta lead Norway to the wc somehow
why does peter keep looking for his dad 😂
all football fans were sad on this night ...
So natural in front of the camera. No false modesty, but not arrogant. Lots of joy!👍🏻😄
What a humble guy.
"So many champions league winner and I'm here all by myself" -Micah please 😂😭🤣
22 year old and already speaks like a veteran, amazing player
what was holding Pep, is the false 9 when he bought a true 9, gg
HAALAND DID NOTHING IN THE GAME YOU GOTTA THANK RODRI
Fully deserved city and haaland a truly magical team
The quadruple isn't for everyone,  Celtic Glasgow however have achieved this. Good effort City. Maybe next year.
9:20 such a wholesome moment
Repeating it next year as well
I'm not a Man City fan but I watched almost all their games just to see this Kid play.
Norway can become a force.
Haaland isn’t a big game player
My Goodness, Haaland... no wonder he is a greatest strikee at this moment, on top of everything I love his character and being humble. Wooww...
This is one player you cannot dislike. He's lethal in the box yet humble and fun to talk to!!! Congratulations Haaland.
He is genuine and naturally funny
I’m sure Micah had more questions for him and he was interrupted 😩
Dont forget the clowns that said "haaland makes city worse" 😂😂😂
after watching final, i really cant see haaland lol. city won treble but he not deserve balon dor
Haaland 0 goals in last 3 ucl games, still win.
Micah and carra are so cringey together
His mentality for a young man makes me sick...too bloody intelligent 😒 Good luck to him but not too much
Whats scary is he might just go on and get even better.
this interview will go down in history when he breaks his own records
Micah at the end saying “So many Champions Leagues winners and I’m all here by my self had me rolling 😂🤙🏾
I swear Micah is changing punditry into a whole vibe , this guy is ❤😅we need him
Интер заслуживал победы больше, играли лучше
Man utd need to sign mbappe so that we could these two go at it in the premier
He’s such a likeable guy. He’s had such a great season. So happy for him
His humbleness is why he is successful.
did not score a goal unfortunately, but that is ok, he will have mor chances to come
they are like children. You can't use children for anything, at least if you can't evade the director's cut from the media
CBS has the best Football media, always hilarious and entertaining.
Haland did you win tonight   Ahhh you know that’s a good question
Haaland well done for avoiding that question that would have put you in a situation against Pep. Truly the interviewer deserved to be called 'awkward'...
This the most I’ve seen Haland talk lol amazing job Man City  Congratulations letsgoooo
I love this guy man
Upcoming goat
Schemichel's low key banter as an ex United is a bit much ngl
It's scary for oppositions that a player already so good is talking about improving and it doesn't even come from a place of arrogance.
yes henry the goat is turning into real ET we knew he isnot of this world the legend the gunner
He seems like a really good guy, humble. Such a great difference compared to dickheads like mbappe, Neymar, ronaldo.
They still have the shields cup… the upcoming league title , and World Cup of clubs cup to go for let’s go city
CHAMPIONS OF EUROPE, WE’LL FOREVER SING THAT 💙⛵️
Today is one of the best days oh!! We  finally did it
First season and won everything while breaking records.What a year for him
0:23 JESUS WHAT IS WRONG WITH JAMIE MAN😭😭😭😭💀💀💀💀 LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOO
❤❤❤❤❤
🛑 HAALAND has a great personality and fun to be around with and we could witness this for the next ten years providing he stays for longer than 2 or 3 years
@ 0:28, what are they asking that made everybody react with laughter? “Any…” what?
This is one of the best I've seen a sportsman talk during the early part of their careers. He is already a pundit❤😊 Congratulations Erling!!
Ballandor loading
His english improved massively. Just watch in couple of years he will develop british accent😅
As a United fan... I cant hate. This man is sheer class
Am arsenal fan but I like Haaland
Man city played with 10 players and still managed to win the CL. Bravo Pep 🎉 Da Campioneś
The are other sports channel crews but the CBS crew is the absolute best!
Where is mbape?😂😂
Perfect gentle man
The level of understanding he has at the age of 22 is scary
What a refreshing player / character on and off the pitch
Very nice guy
Treble winner and Made English PL a farmers league  Haaland:- EH!......why not
“What A stress I ate soo much as a kid” 😂😂😂
History has been made today . Manchester city , champions of Europe.  Finally pep has done it ❤
Bester Mann
haaland champion league b4 mbappe...
Very touching seeing a past legend in Henry give advice to a potential future legend in Haaland. Touching not "awkward" idea from Jaime. Lmao Haaland roasted them.
You gotta give a lot of credit to inter they played a beautiful game. The fullbacks went up and down the pitch  stretching the play, midfielders pressed every inch of that field, defenders kept haalanf quite, and onana was just immense. Fck the strikers though,and especially those jokers lukakaku and lautaro.
Ballon dot no doubt I do T want to hear anything else
This panel has officially jumped the shark in believing their own hype. Let the man SPEAK. They're trying so hard to get a funny viral clip and it made what was a very insightful, emotional interview a bit cringe at times.
ok im a liverpool fan but im starting to like him just as a person
That moment when he realized how much his parents sacrificed for him to get to where he is today got to me.
Love the self reflection when he says he is only 22... he puts pressure on himself yet he understands he is only young.
On his first season, he win with his team most of the trophy they could..
"what next" is a question you should not ask a night like this.
My man probably spoke the longest in his life!  Such a lovable lad! 🥰💙
Forget Mbappe, Haaland and Vini are the future of football. Incredible talent and resilience in the face of adversity.. loads of records are set to be broken!
I do love how down to earth Haaland is...
Love this 🩵🩵💪🏽
“Sometimes you two are A BIT AWKWARD!” 😂
EPL Top scorer, scoring 50+ goals in all competition, winning treble, and still - when given opportunity to ask one question to one of the best striker in the world, he ask for advice. This young man... oh damn!
02:10 "You haven't really played well!"  Yeah, he didn't score 5 goals in the last 20 days, although he occupied the attention of 2 defenders from the opponent team.  😱
"Go find your dad" sounded kinda funny 😂
kate Abdo 🥰
Very well spoken for a 22 year old. 👏
you criminal haaland you lost 1-0 theif return the trophy to United if you did not want to spend your life in Manchester prison for not scoring own goals in the final
Pep is a genius in modern football he knows exactly who to bring in Erling was icing on a cake !!!!
Refreshing that he doesn't recite the cliches the players repeat like a mantra.
แมนชิทังใจ_💙💙💙💙💙
Micah so sad at the end murdered me
Moneychester City
Good lad
The best 22 yo I seen since the Phenomeno , R9
Erling is so humble, he ask for the advice from hendry
He’s definitely improved at interviews
Haaland saw 'the chance' and got out of the way for Rodri to take it. Beautiful.
Mbappe the spoiled child should watch his interview and learn from him
Size of him fkn monster as big as big Pete I'm actually more happy for me Richards
Great watch, interview, he’s a good young man and Sean’s he’s got he’s head together, but I wish he wasn’t Norwegian😢😅😅
KOF CARRIGOH YOU MUG
Unbelievably mature! Meanwhile Henry giving him technical advice after just winning UCL, that was awkward 🙈
With this young man’s mentality, determination, humbleness, and pure talent - there is no feat he couldn’t accomplish. What a legend in the making
Everyone on insta hating him because he didn’t score in the last 2 finals 😂
Messi is the best player in the world right now
Ballon D'or for Halland
Ayo the fisrt minute PAUSE!
I love how awkward this interview is
this interview went on for too long
Haaland is only 22 years old n he already helped Man City to win e treble!!! Can't imagine how many more trophies he will help Man City to win it for e next few years!!!
Great guy, very funny, horrendous footballer but the most lethal finisher in the world. Great respect.
I remember comparing this guy to lord nunez
Glad the media training hasn’t taken everything from Erling great lad not hateable
Haaland is so funny, I love him so much
Man,AI is getting out of hand
he deserves it so much
Man henry such a simp bro☠️
France will wait for you in the next Euro and World Cup Erling, so please wait for Mbappe in the UCL a bit more. Things are going to be interesting in the next few years 😏🇫🇷 And congratulations of course young crack 👏
"sometimes you two are a bit awkward"😂  WTF
im shocked that no one asking him anything about ballon d or thing
Haaland interview speech has improved 😅
Protagonist of Football
Who is standing between Haaland abd Carragher?
I thought his home town was Leeds.
United fan. What an interview, what a player. Nobody better in world football at the minute, humble and absolutely brilliant player. Well deserved success for the lad, pains me to say
struggled against the big big teams but good thing he got the experience already. he is so humbled and he will become a bigger monster
Haaland probably looks like a robot/machine on the pitch but he's the most human in interview
Haaland with Peter Schmeichel. The first treble winner with Man United
The next GOAT.
haaland is like the giant guy who is very wholesome and would probably share a sandwich with you
Bro ....watching this.... what a guy i can't ever hate this dude , what an honest talented bro.
Ballon d’or
It would not have been the same if the team won the CL but lost the championship. So, he was definitely one of the architects of his team's victory, that X-Factor they needed.
Messi tetap terbaik❤
He spoke from  his heart and that's rare these days on tv especially around football.
Very unique personality he has …almost savant like …didn’t expect him to be this dead pan in his vocal skills
It was noted that Haaland was nervous and the final weighed heavily on him, I think Alvarez should have entered, but luckily Rodri knew how to take advantage of that Inter mistake.
If I were Haaland I would be hanging out with T. Henry a lot imagine the insight he could give Haaland.
He's young and he will grow and get better. You don't expect a Young Ronaldo to score a Hat Trick in a Final.
My boy Haaland is still just a kid ! And a treble already to his name. World class but like he said still so much more to learn ! Congrats Erling 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
City need to owe lukaku what an incredible save😂😂. Next gen goalkeeper
This interview and past interviews from CBS just shows how much of a nice person Haaland is. Love this guy even as a Spurs fan!
And the Ballon d'or winner is :
"Anywhere else" 😂😂😂
Let’s hope he win the ballondor so that fraud doesn’t steal it
I was completely on board with Messi winning the Ballon d'Or again after the World cup, but this has been a special season for Haaland. If football is truly honest, no one deserves to be called the best in the world more than him right now!
He is such an intelligent kid.
“so many champions league winners & im here by myself “. 😂😂😔😂😂
Everyone saying he ghosts in big games but we are forgeting that this guy is 22 and this his first season on the big stage. He will definitly prove in the future.
Guy is 22 on 400k a week and scores for fun in the best team in Europe right now....... At 22 i was getting drunk every weekend and generally being a knob head.  Mistakes where made
"How could you improve?" Repeat treble is on, simply incredible
How is life? Poor punditry.
Congrats!!! Finally! But ...not to bring the mood down... The performance was quite poor and it looked if they have been out of shape physically. Also, the squad stayed in England until Thursday night and only had Fri and half-Sat to adjust to the clime and area. Unless, all those celebrations (EPL, FA) continued somewhere on the back ground and in parallel. This was anything but a solid performance of Champions. Should have stayed tuned and sharp until the end and showed their best or at least 50% of their best. It did not look even 20% today (tbh)
Funny how he found the two English lads awkward, they’d make yeah cringe watching them
Hes so exceptionally grounded, it's rare to find people with his mindset even outside of athletes. Add on all the fame, worth, and accomplishments and its remarkable how nice of a guy he is. Paying attention to the kitchen staff, helping the groundskeepers clean up after practice, saying thank you to all the security and staff at events. Just such a cool guy.
Young, Genuine, Well-Spoken & Master at his work, Erling is a likeable guy and a player in every sense, Congrats to him and City🎉👏
🎤Tu felicidad es mi felicidad Manchester city ❤️😃😀
Now pep gt the treble he can leave.. manshity wont last with that 114 charges.. all of this gonna be useless.  The players need to look elsewhere now.
And Scnmeichel on riding his luck. Hell, what about Man Utd's luck against Munich in their treble final hitting he post then scoring two in last minutes!! Sub titles for Carragher's witterings please. How the hell can he get a job commentating!!
This crew is on another level
Why are they interviewing halland he didn't even score the winning goal
Erling haaland is a gift to us from god and borussia Dortmund
It’s happening this year for Alvarez: first the World Cup win & now the UCL
So Erhling, WHEN are you going to score another goal??? And how did you change into that black two piece so quickly??? Any rumour they are selling you to Forest Green?
Haaland for 22 this guy is the next goat! Absolute mentality monster 💙🩵💙🩵
I thought his hometown was Leeds 😂
Jamie reslly a menace y'all 😂
His English may have gotten better, but his sense of humour hasn't faded away...🤣
Haaland really does get the WEIRDEST interview questions lmao this guy can't catch a break xD
Im 22 and damn he accomplished the dream young forsure
As much as you want mate.
Erling Haaland so humble and down to earth. No ego like Mpambe
Here is the difference Erling Haaland and klin Mpambe Ego ego ego respect and  love teammate
I just realized that there's 3 treble winners in this video
He missed celebrating with his team mates for that awkwardness?
Class
haland balok door
Haaland is going to become the best player in the world because he is not like the other players that just focus on fame or TikTok or being a show off . He is there to take care of business and help his team. That’s how a pro is , not there to be childish but still enjoy the game.
Man city deserves it
so humble human, you going to be bigger that just now!
It's scary how mature he is mentally. It's amazes me how he don't just say he can improve, but he knows the areas of his game that it need to be sharpened. He's humble and already it's the best striker in the world this year. I'm from Brazil, don't support any team in Europe, as a neutral fan of the sport, i can only wish that he develops to his full potencial, because at this rate, he will be a top 5 striker of all time when he reaches his 30s
Mbappe won the World Cup as a teenager. Haaland wins CL and treble at 22. Vinicius won the CL at 21. These are the new stars after Messi and CR.
What a wholesome young man. Very humble yet such extraordinary talent and skill. Wow. Congrats to him and his team. 🎉🎉🎉
I love these group of pundits😂
It pisses me off they won the trebel but showed up manchester because machester residents  can now say that they have 2 team that won trebels
Quadruple, Quintuple, Sextuple. They can always achieve more
Peter are not such good keeper he is wise man too
You can see they put so much pressure on him to help win the UCL
These guys on CBS are the best footie show by a country mile.
I hate how mature he is lol
Let's take a moment for Julian Alverez, who has just won a Treble after winning Copa America and the WC! The kid is 23!
alot of these players and managers get asked silly questions
Alguien q la traduzca al español😢
this group of players deserved the win today. Not their best day, but still the best team
he is not the world best striker at all he’s been carried and De Bruyne is his reason for goals. Haaland can’t dribble, his touch is horrible, and he can’t pass. Mbappe is 1000x clearer he can do everything.
I never seen Halaand open like this before.
Football Football Footballlll Mann .. what a gift to Humanity……
Love pep but I'm a Wolves fan Man United Are not a million miles behind
That’s the thing , people think these players are robots this boy just said he was anxious he had pain in is stomach but the only thing people are worrying about it’s he didn’t scored he lost so many duel oh my goodness. Anyway I’m glad it’s all over, get some rest boy
Unreal season from Haaland in his debut The sky is the limit, what an historic treble 💙💙💙
2:04 The pundit next to Halland is so disrespectful, saying he didn't play well in front of him like that ? it's kind of disrespectful even if it were to be true, let alone that he didn't have a lot of chances and he didn't made blunders.
Dude is so humble and down to earth. No ego at the age of 22! Props to him and his parents to have such a mindset.
Dad + son... Where to find this thing in moden era
As a United fan, I'm so happy that they did the treble. True quality deserves to prevail, no matter who they are.
Micah 😢, remember Ibra and Ronaldo never won it, you are not alone
Finally OIL MONEY WON BIG EARS 😂
Erling Haaland was Manchester City's good luck charm in the Champions League. And people need to remember he is still only 22 yrs old. Has not even entered his prime yet. Rodri is a legend. A Rolls Royce of a player. And it's so cool for Ederson to finally get his flowers. Of all the players to step up. It was City's keeper that gets overlooked & questioned. My MOTM for sure. Credit to Inter Milan for making a great challenge. So happy for Pep, and all of my fellow Man City supporters. Congratulations to Manchester City. Champions of England, FA Cup Champions, & Champions of Europe!!!🏆🏆🏆 Well done City!🙌💙
Guess who's winning the Ballon' Dor
Micah 😂😂😂😂😂 it’s a whole vibe
I hope Haaland isnt too tired cause he needs to score several goals for Norway in the qualifiers in a week. We need to win those games cause without him when he was injured against Spain and Georga we were hopeless in front of goal. We should have won both these games actually, but couldnt score an endd up with a lousy 1 point.
The artificiality of this club should anger anyone who enjoys football. They’re everything that is wrong with the game. What a shame they win this trophy
Top Class
Last comment ❤❤❤❤❤
That Black guy is always so cringe
He violated arsenal second best in England 😂
He’s young. In the entire interview you can see him giving sighs of reliefs. He must’ve had some really immense couple of weeks. The pressure he’s gotta carry, being City’s main man, and the star of the team.  He’s done it after all. City have finally won the CL, and also the treble, right after signing him in his first season.
dude ghosted the whole match...hope he works on his all round game...
😂this is the most I have seen halaand speak and the longest sentences I have heard from him
erling haaland alarm is champion league anthem. Dream and wakes up to it everyday. now he is champion with golden boots.
MCFC doubted everyone wrong what a team what a club what a project ✨🔥 Well deserved ✅✅
I hate this manchester city, Pep go back to your tiki taka.  I want the beautiful game back!
Halaand always humble and funny at the same time. Make me laught the whole interview 😅😅
First time I’ve seen him emotional. Can tell he’s been keeping up a persona all season. Maybe he’s not a robot after all
Just here to say the truth. The cheating club won it at last. 115 broken rules + 1.5bn spent and they won it soo amazing
this guy always gets wierd questions xD
HUMBLE ,EXCELLENT and RESPECTFUL .... Erling Haaland will no doubt DOMINATE the next decade of football no matter where he plays for !
What a remarkable young man - a testament to himself and his parents and all those who've helped him along the way!
Talking about Haaland father being injured is crazy considering Roy Keane intentionally injured him
Love this guy!!!
"dont forget I am just 22" - is what the dude said. scary
The last kingdom...
Grealish cost much more than haaland 😂 just shows the people who create the price don’t know the price 😂
9:37 what do you mean stop
Props to haaland for a great debut season but let's be real. Even if he doesn't play Messi's winning that Ballon D'Or lol
He was brought in to do this, he may not have physically affected the game, but he's changed the team to win 3 titles. A true catalyst to make a brilliant team into a legendary team. And only 22. The beginning of greatness
Hes young. Too much for him
I’m Manchester City fan I’m happy to much
never heard haland talk so much lol
If Haaland doesn't win the Ballon D'or genuinely that award is rigged. 52 goals in 53 games is FIFA NUMBERS, came to city first year wins golden boot and does the treble with city, Thats 10x better individual season then being average in france and winning the WC cus you got a penalty every game (basically rigging a comp for 1 player)
Carra is apserlutley sickkkkkkk we have won it 😂😂😂 hence why hese acting a twat
As a ManU fan it didn't hurt as much as I thought it would. Well deserved for City and I can appreaciate their happiness. Good for them all, players and fans.
My favorite player from the current generation. What a humble guy ❤
Such a wonderful ambassador for the game with Messi and Ronaldo fading out. So humble, so talented, man deserves it.
From an investment point of view, both Inter and Man City are crooked clubs. But as a Milanista from Milano, we are so happy tonight. Man City played just badly enough to give Inter hope - that's what makes it even more funny. Lukaku is now a Milan legend forever. He has single handedly taken two european trophies away from FC Inda of the Chinese plastic corporation. Thank you, Pep!!!
Peter lets the team down. So boring
The subtle jab "Odengaard, that's been captain for the second best team in England" 😂 legend
Don't worry Haaland. Ronaldo has never scored in a final or the winner!
We're the same age and he's much more articulate than me and it's not even his first language.
I keep waiting for Peter Schmeichel to perform a magic trick.
tbh i can see that this past few weeks the pressure really get to him. I mean he’s young and the pressure that the media put in their team and him individually might be too much to him yet. however he’s still young, and i believe that he will improve more especially in big games like this in the future.
Haaland is destined for greatness 🙌
Just reflect a second. This dude just won a treble in his first year at the club that never did. He is the best scorer in PL history in his first year in England. His focus aside the obvious happiness and relief from pressure is ''how can I improve, I will be thinking differently when I am 25''. 22 years.
I like this dude his so talented but so humble at the same time
Watching Arsenal back in the day, I never realized how tall Thierry Henry  was until right now, he is listed at 6'2 and isn't much shorter than Haaland. I could have sworn he was 5'11, barely 6'0 on the pitch.
Seems like such a great guy
Peter the Spoon
Micah really silent in this situation, finally he burst into the scene.  The man enjoying his team won the UCL.
(At the end) Kate abdo: go find your dad!! 🤣🤣🤣
It’s the guy from FIFA!!!
Actually, what a player   He ruined my teams dreams in the prem this season But I can’t take anything from him, humble, effective, goal machine.  Hats off to Haaland. Would like to see him win the Ballon Dor even if the competition is against the goat.
donkey!!!!👊
Alright I can't hate on Erling as a United fan, what a great guy. I wish I am 22 again...
the new Zlatan
Erling is sooo blunt... it's so refreshing. Seems like a genuinely nice guy to hangout with  5k+ likes 😁 Thanks a lot y’all
This interview gone sexual in so many ways ahahaha
what comes to mind when you heard the final whistle?   toilet. i need to go to the toilet. my stomach hurts since the kick off.
Love peter’s comments 😂😂
So fun!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉
Football is about joy . These bring that in buckets
How do you spell “Ballan Dior “ ?
114 charges pending
Bit weird of Schmiechel to try and mug off Haaland's dad to Haaland himself - weird comment to make.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Really excellent player and nice guy! 👏🏼👏🏼
Haalaand won the Treble but lost Ballon d'or by not scoring the last 5 games. Messi should win it 1 last time.
Champions of Europe and England ✨🏆🏆🏆✨
Ballon d or 99 % Loading
what did he mean by the "anywhere else? question
kate's laughter is my favorite
Peters obsessed with his dad
Congrats on the treble 2 golden boots and balon d’or
SAVAGE! Erling is right. It had been some time someone won the treble and it had to be done again!
He actually speaks like a viking.
Kate Abdo next season intro will be like: $ Micah Richards the man who managed to touch a Champion's League medal when Halaand was being interviewed.  😂😂😂😂   You ganna be roastes Micah.
These dudes are so hilarious, every clip gets funnier & funnier. We get stuck with Jake Humphrey’s & the other bums on BT instead of these legends.
"Don't forget I'm 22!" Wow
What a guy!
22 years old and achieved so much already. He will break every possible record out there.. Outstanding player with great mentality
Manchester is Blue 💙🏆🔥
messi is the clear favorite for the balon dOr but haaland got a real good argument to win it as well 🤷🏽‍♂️ both deserve it
Kate Abdo: Where's the anxiety before the games? Haaland: In my stomach Carragher: Anywhere else? Haaland: *looking at his pants  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Oil money wins the treble!!!!
0:28 Kate's laughter, so wholesome
Im happy for Erling but he was very average during the semi and final. If he can't score hes alnost to no use. De bruyne makes this team tick especially this season. For me KDB should win the Ballon d'or.
He felt the pressure in the big games , No worries! They have won the Treble after all .
Halaand : 6.5 rated performance in UCL final. Messi : 9.5 rated performance in World Cup final.
