This is plan is natural effect
All I see is CGI
Starlink should have been banned.
So where is the Anime cat girl?
Wowwwwwwwwww!!!!
we lost 15% of our starlink satellite dish communication in our community.  All the home's only have starlink.
the very crazy (thing) is: You are The Very Real and trusty: well: You did think ? I can think: You are Great, and You know This: maaaan anam man an
i love this oh men i i do admire
Ich finde das sehr gut. Das ist ein grosser Fortschritt. Danke schön - thank You. now let's go :) And may i say: i do like this, i do like it, i do appreciate and: i will look  and see and ... i like, thank You :)
Next time I will turn down the brightness on my screen when it takes off. Got welders flash

Have they went back to the moon lately and if so why haven't they sent anyone up there , they apparently went to the moon literally years ago so why haven't me put a man on Mars or itleast done more research on the moon , it all doesn't make sense to me hopefully space X does these things as NASA hasn to improved since the last manned mission to the moon , doesnt seem right to me plus aren't rockets just  glorified fireworks .
Wow- Thanks
I don't think I've ever wanted a company to succeed as much as I do SpaceX.
Stunning PRECISION....  and link kept on the bark....
Who makes the intro background music?
Elon has dose this so many times its a walk in the park, sorry, walk on mars

Eu queria mostrar esse vídeo interessante para vocês. Olha esses rapazes inventores o que eles fizeram. Criaram uma lanterna gigante de LED. A lanterna gigante é tão potente que derrete gênero com a luz dela e também com a luz dela chega a esquentar vidro até explodir o vidro. Veja o vídeo deles montando a lanterna e olhe como interessante.  https://youtube.com/shorts/Juo4pgoFDYw?feature=share
Watching with starlink wifi 😎
Süüüüüüü
And you'll wonder why you are controlled and manipulated and here things you cannot see through the network you chose to be injected with.
So how long before other SpaceX debris crashes into the moon? 🤣
Ñ 👍😎
THIS COMPANY IS LEADING YOU STRAIGHT TO HELL .. JESUS IS COMING.
Nice

It's amazing how this technology now feels so normal! Go SpaceX!
I see visual improvement here, nice :)
Espectacular ;)+

Great show, A lot better than the one the government is putting on for a long haulers. The way Long Hauler Crohn’s disease works:  Typically anything you eat and most things you drink are perceived as a threat by your body in the form of gut damage.  In response your body produces cystic fibrosis.  What that means is often after you eat or drink something you begin to cough up mucus that suddenly appears in the airways.  A coronavirus long hauler with such medical condition experiences a huge increase in frequency, severity and duration of this cystic fibrosis on a daily basis.   So far I cannot tell if this is permanent but it has been over a year. It’s time for the government to step up and do something for long haulers with permanent health issues. 🆘 ❤️  #Crohns #COVID #LongHauler #JUSTBELOVE #Coronavirus #Cysticfibrosis
Not to mention the debris in water  and we as humans have goofed a planet and we already hear of space trash maybe u should cleanup ur act and company
Wait we supposed drive electric cars cause pollution I wonder how much pollution just one takeoff takes say compared to private jet don't hear companies claim be green but don't look green
So years ago we ruining ozone layer with hairspray anyone think sending tons spaceships and rockets thru is good or why is one good and one isn't
Max headroom has no place in cyber space let Mr Bob pick up the piece lost in that place
Hey do you have a job for a clairvoyant or know any one who will help me out
I know it's crazy but I seen a tiktok video of something hitting the moon thee other day ?maybe a short on YouTube
hi, SpaceX's StarShips, U.S. It is a military project funded by Space Force. Aim; It is the logistics of a ship departing from the USA by landing vertically at any earth location (or by entering the atmosphere and spilling (bouncing)) within 30 minutes. In fact, Elon Must is not a saint, but rather a "weapon maker." The point is this: This technology will be reflected in air transportation. Transatmospheric vehicles carrying personnel taking off vertically will land vertically at the airport after 30 minutes. In this case

Sir please provide jobs in  uttar pradesh Bareilly India your company are very interesting company just like spacex i love you company but I am not very educated but my mind is very interesting just like your mind so please give me a some job apportunity please sir
Elon, you have to get to Mars as soon as you can because if the Chinese get there first they will make the planet a province of China and no one will be permitted to land there.
Oh boi In previous lunch transporter3 I commented that that was one of the most amazing separation video from ground camera This launch make it 2 from 2.. 20:15 that's a very cool views from ground cameras.
Thanks for ruining the sky for astronomers.....
Her voice is so cute.
🔷
Elon Musk my favourite hero .iam indian 🇮🇳
Funny how the landing cameras always cut out
How does the company feel about the idea of taking nuclear waste to the moon with rockets?
SpaceX 🚀 Very Cool 😎
👏👏👏👏👏
just think in a few weeks there might not be an earth to lift off from , you best stop biden from causing world war 3 this war is a nuclear war that will end the entire earth , best think about this seriously .
On my birthday too

Can we put a long rocket into a long (1 mile) vacuum rail gun (magnetic) and to launch it at a +7.5 Mach speed? We could save a lot of fuel. The vertical rail gun could be put inside a mountain like Everest so the rocket will get out of the rail gun's vacuum almost directly into the Stratosphere that has less air friction and density. The rockets could be used for sending raw materials into the space, not for the human transportation due to the extreme acceleration. In the future the maximum speed of the magnetic rail guns should increase exponentially by increasing the size and the tecnology.
imagine the internet provided only the StarLink type and it just becomes useless. What to see ..., communications, trade, peace become pleasant memories.
go Doug!
Responsible with your own satelites , do not bother and nudge others

Someone leaked the starship interior https://youtube.com/shorts/7d8fXxcUOAg?feature=share
Stop making us wait months and months for Starlink after we have paid our $100. Tell us the real date, stop lying!  The US comes first. !!!!!!!Q!Q!~!~!!~
Are you going to the mars ?
I just can’t get over how insane this is every time i see it.
You've got to hear this. "Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved." Acts4:12 Please think about it. Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved. Love Y'all
My grandfather worked at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. He would be so proud and excited to see what's goin on over there these days!

Coming up with a unified theory would be as hard as summarizing 14 billion years into one moment
Please read over my email, trust me my invention could help with emergency landings if the rocket were tip over either over shooting it or landing too soon. The idea is to preserve the rocket and hopefully in an emergency situation bring the rocket back to an upright position. Saving not only the rocket but possibly in the future the people and cargo inside.
My 🤔 idea was if artificial sun will launch on the Mars that Sun works with the help of solar power which gives increasing temperature for balancing global warming and melting frozen water on Mars by continuously supplying adequate quantities of heat on Mars with the connection of solar panels for giving adequate quantities of heat enourmously  on Mars by this conversion of Mars atmosphere into the 🌍 atmosphere will support in raising of Oxygen and Plantation by providing this powerful heat supplying artificial sun on Mars
SpaceX should use a re-entry heat shield that will use superconductor magnets to generate a magnetic field strong enough to deflect the superhot plasma formed during re-entry of returning spacecraft.
Amazing  🛰️ 📡 🙂🇵🇰
Hello, I'm actually looking for a good trader that can help me trade and make good profit, I've been seeing so many recommendations but I don't think they're trusted.
Well done. I'm loving your new cameras. I'm so proud of you all 💞💞
All under the Governance of NASA.
We will create PEM or Prince Elon Musk STARSHIP ENTERPRISE, and SpaceX Inter-Galactic FACILITY STATION in MARS and in the L2.
I live in md. Im a extreme non linear thinker. I have no college paperwork or advanced math skills but i can solve some of the wildest problems with super simplistic procedures. Would spacex hire me?..
👏👏👏👏👏
How about shipping me a dish, so I can use it?
I wonder if Elon Musk watches every one of these launches....still in amazement of what they have accomplished.
When they say they lose communication of audio and video, that's when the government deploys THEIR satellites/weapons into orbit... Gonna tell me with this whole Starlink setup, we can keep audio and video rolling through the feed? Give me an f'ing break...
Seeing the Falcon 9 lands for the 100+ time still amazes me..Never gets old.  Way to go spacex!

ELON MUSK ON TOP
Never gets old! I've watched every launch and the shots of the exhaust plumes or RCS thrusters is beautiful. My Dad was an engineer with NASA Engineering and Development and died a couple of years after the shuttle program ended. He wasn't a drone collecting a paycheck, he was a believer and dreamer into our exploration of space. He'd be so excited and proud of what SpaceX has accomplished with reusable boosters.
Still waiting on mine, now unable to log into the system for whatever reason.
Seeing the Falcon 9 lands for the 100+ time still amazes me..Never gets old.  Way to go spacex!
Oh man, our internet name is Starlink. Coincidence? I don't think
谢谢 马斯克
Cant wait to throw money at this IPO
nice
Some guys drive to see spacex then crass the car
Would love to be at the Cape one day when they land a booster back on land. Number 103 successful landing and it is still incredible to watch every time. Congrats to SpaceX team and Shortfall of Gravitas for being there :-)
Never get tired of seeing those stage one landing legs deploy. Reminds me of the landing legs on the Vulcan exploratory ship in First Contact.
Genius
Isso poluam bastante o espaço

Excellent no more, no less just excellent !!!
Still not getting old seeing these land. Just amazing.
when you get to mars send us back a flying car for normal transport :)🙂
wow i just learned alot about space ship
One must not get complacent.  Errors exists.  The starlink team always happy....Wink
What’s funny is how they don’t let us see a live camera link to what stays up there
Help finding the intro song? I can't find it anywheres
Investing in cryptocurrency is the best way of getting ahead to build wealth, investing remains a priority. The cryptocurrency market has plenty of opportunities to earn decent payout.

Why does the thumbnail look like space is urinating on some lake?
I’ll never get tired of watching the boosters land. It’s amazing!
19:30 U can see the glow on the tip due to the friction with the air in the thermal camera.
Some of the most realistic CGI in ages
Crazzzzzzy
I’ll never get tired of watching the boosters land. It’s amazing!
I know we're from planet earth tho..
thanks Elon. never stop!
Cool views, thank you Spacex!
This is so exciting!
Starlink satellites mar a fifth of asteroid-spotting telescope's critical observations.
Good job Mister musk into the entire space x-team 16
Good job Mister musk into the entire space x-team
How can we have a loss of signal, why doesn't Falcon 9 talk to the Starlink satellites instead of the current ground stations?  Great job, over 100 successful launches and landings.  Also the exhaust plume of the rvac is cool.  I never imagined it would be so large in diameter, but there must be some huge velocity gas coming out with 0 pressure at the end of the nozzle.
Super technology !!!
Pollution
Starlink is just a load of space junk. Stop it.
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. All you have to do is believe in him and you will be saved. ❤ ✝️
That was amazing, watching how the booster went through the clouds from the rocket's perspective
https://youtu.be/TiP5305nPaI
No matter how many times I watch the boosters land it still gets my heart pounding.
The bar spacex sets on these quality launch videos is so high - the presentation, smooth camera shots etc I can’t help be a bit disappointed by other launch provider coverage.
do you think Elon musk is smart?  Everything you're looking at is for not it's a waste and Elon knows it… But what else can you do with all that money?  I hate to break it to you guys but there's nowhere to go in space.  Do you really want to live and die on Mars?  That's all that's happening.  There's nowhere to go should Earth be non-livable toxic waste land… It's coming and you can see it.…  Take a good look you see there's just nowhere to go and it really is final is simply case closed
Wow
More space JUNK!!
Let’s go!!!!
The future is space exploration, it amazing how fast the human race has evolved
This is so awesome. What a great time to be alive.
103 landings. 103 boosters that didn’t get built and thrown away.  127 Merlins that didn’t get built and thrown away. Na, reusability will never amount to anything.
Pretty neat
Lost signal to lack of  ground control coverage?..."Use Starlink" maybe?
at a buffet, i personally sneak corndogs into the buffet so others can enjoy them. I hide 6 corndogs in my jacket pockets. it then, is a joy for me to see other patrons of the establishment eat my corndogs thinking they were part of the buffet.
♥️♥️♥️
Not a fan of Elon or StarStink.
I c no evil speak no evil hear no evil
I rather watch space and earth footage during the flight, why not have cameras showing front and side view? The whole flight footage was some metal and a burning engine.
Finally a good view of the droneship landing! Incredible.
Wow! Nice camera!    Greate job SpaceX  Greetings from Poland
very nice flight
Bullseye!  SpaceX are awesome.
Excellent job to SpaceX and  NASA  👍👍 Keep up the good work  With the Starlink satellites 📡  🛰  Starfleet command  will be so happy 😀
I love SpaceX but I can’t help to think about what all these extra fumes are going to do to our atmosphere 🤦🏽‍♂️
Almost daily flights to space!!!! Next stop James Cameron’s avatar’s Pandora! Change here for Saturn system 😂
These guys are good!
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Those landings never get old
Starlink will never be profitable as it is being setup currently.
SpaceX needs a small-mechazilla on the drone ship ;-)
Elon Musk IS best
Never thought I would miss a live launch and landing of falcon 9 but here we are
i thought this thing was a star
Now that the drone ship cameras have improved images, all we need now is a  wider camera angle; especially when the ship is the size of football a field.
Seen every launch/landing and never get tired of watching them, which begs the question- Where's Blue Origin? Bezos talks a good talk, but has yet to deliver on anything other than two lame suborbital flights and then having the audacity to claim that everyone onboard is now an astronaut. Talk about arrogance! In that regard my money is on Virgin Galactic. At the very least their ship looks like something other than an XX-rated movie prop.
This is definitely one of the coolest and cleanest drone ship footage we got so far! Letsagooo
Never goes up always across. Because it’s BS.
more space junk.. great.
Awesome, the new camera work is giving really mind blowing insights
17:25
Hey Guys, I want to go to Mars! Volunteer n. One!
The drone ship footage didn't cut-off!!
Amazing!
more satellites for military use again
With all the satellites SpaceX launched, how come they can't zero in on the last stage progress when ground link is lost? I would think at least one in the area with line of sight could.
This never gets old!
Why we dont saw deploy more?
Compliments to the program director on this flight, the footage was amazing! Nice solid (ish) signal on landing too!
Yippie youpie Youmei Zhou. I like how her voice sounds. It sounds she is about to laugh in a second all the time :).
Excellent commentary.
Так, так.... А двигатели всё ещё русские, Илон? Да как так то!
So with a little effort this man has been able to restart the space program that NASA had "forgotten how" to make rockets. There's a good reason we "forgot" all those years ago and it wasn't the first time history has forgotten how to get us into space. The rocket design we used until Musk was as old as time (sorry I don't remember the exact year)
SpaceX must change Starship booster design to be able to launch multi ship, like fuel tanker with full of fuel payload  etc.(much more stronger and bigger booster) even to launch(modified ) starship too..
Lame...>WE WANT EXPLOSIONS
I know that earth is flat, and you mf s are lying😠😠😠
Amazing! Top top top!!!
2019....?? ..she said 2019??
26:21 is this a green flash from the TEA-TEB?
Congratulations  SpaceX  team.
Илон, дай свой интернет со старлинка в Россию!
Let’s see now, you want us to get on your spaceships and fly away from the earth?
STOP SATELLITE POLLUTION NOW!
It's crazy how spacex is able to make self landing rockets and 20/10 years we don't have that but space is going to be the best/most likely to be the space lending industry? Lol
Outstanding as usual, I always get excited when watching SpaceX launches, payload deployment and the landing of the 1st stage, along with all the bits in between. It is amazing how far SpaceX have come in such a short time, they have revolutionised space flight to LEO and landings of the 1st stage and dragon. Go SpaceX go and may God be with you and yours as you mingle with the stars.
Youmei has gotten a lot better - I’ve watched some of the first and she was so shy. Great to see how excited everyone still gets upon successfully launching these into orbit!
Ba19b
W końcu widać dokładnie lądowanie na platformie.
I was in class watching this just now.. it was incredible seeing what the stage one formed!! GO SPACEX!!
Great landing💨✊
update we love your show &  spacex. We  traveled to Boca Chica to the the starshing get built. & we got the S dual motor fsd last Christmas 🎄 😎 still have the cybertruck tri motor or 4 motor fsd on order, i got lots of solar & backup battery system to charge them both. love tsla stock
Awesome! I have my starlink system on order! Can’t wait!
It's a shame that there is so much resistance against SpaceX, a jealous Bosos and the other Legacy companies are the reason Starship has not orbited the earth yet.
Quit the Woke Nonsense at the beginning of the commentary, and just focus on the science !!!!!
More junk in space.....
WOW, its so nice, chek my YT.
Amazing work SpaceX!!! So awesome!!!
well done SpaceX.
Can someone from spacex can go to valve and code nice anticheat for csgo?
Thanks for polluting the night sky with your multitude of satellites that leave streaks across astrometric photographs.
A lot of us are commenting about how the F9 launch / recovery cycle never gets old, and I am right there with them. What I appreciate on top of that is that we *always* hear SX engineers cheering and clapping for every major event in this cycle, from launch to booster landing, etc.   I hope that the team at SpaceX continues to feel that sense of accomplishment every time, that even when there have been /hundreds/ of F9 stage 1 recoveries & launch cycles - and subsequently Starship booster and ship recoveries & launch cycles - the thrill and sense of achievement stays real and fresh.  Thanks for reminding us that wild imaginings can become part of our daily life, yet remain amazing every time we witness them.  Stay inspired.   Ad astra, SpaceX.
Hello everyone, is this stage of 49 Starlink satellites for internet services ?
They've done an amazing job with the video feeds during landing!
Spacex é simplesmente incrível!!
Again....  SPACE X made my day!  Thanks Elon &The team!
++++++++++++
Every booster landing seems like an amazing miracle to me.
Great video watching it on 2160p which it very clear.  Another perfect landing right in the bullseye just perfection love it
Ok ok .... WTH is that 21:35 🤔
@ T+1:16 a voice says "MAX Q" then 1 second later writing appears explaining what "MAX Q" means - then the presenter repeats what was said and what it means, do they think were illiterate and deaf?
шикарно
Could not stay up to watch it live as it would have been 2 am had a busy day was dog  tired.   Hope everything goes great for SpaceX and Elon hope you have a busy year ahead
i love to see the launches but i am sick to death of the constant need to to talk as soon as it launches, we can hear what's being said by mission control because of the presenters flapping like 1 armed pigeons - we can't hear what's being said by the launch director cus of them yapping so they repeat what was said - if she shut up in the first place we would be able to hear it for ourselves
Can we send joe Biden up with it please. We need trump back
Tai
So glad you pointed out mlk in a rocket launch.  Stop pandering.
That was an amazing view from the ground for this launch! seeing the fairings and first stage with the exhaust from the 2nd stage, that was just awesome.
So beautiful!!! Thanks always Spacex team 🙏. Youmei you’re commentary was lovely and I always enjoy learning a little bit more each launch 👌💕
You didn't show 49 Falcon baby. where are they?
She needs a foam covered microphone to damped the high frequencies coming from her mouth.
yep lets throw more useless junk into space
Good. Very good!!!
wasn't the clearest most stable video of the landing yet?  Excellent!!!!! will never get old
Amazing, two straight launches where we can actually use the Vero Beach long-range camera. And this one has such incredible views.
Having watched the first rockets take off in the 60's to actually seeing a rocket for real at Cape Kennedy to where SpaceX is now is a phenomenon and I'm just glad it has happened in my lifetime and I have seen it as a boy and loved the mystery and magic of spaceflight for so long. To see space travel like this truly makes me feel lucky and blessed. Thank you for letting us continue to see that magic.
20:15 that looks sooooo amazing 👏🏽👏🏽🔥🔥
SpaceX nailing these like someone drives to and from work every day
I applied for Starlink last year, does anybody have any information for when the satellite maybe available, I live in North West Scotland. Thanks in advance.
Nice explanation of an Orbit and as always great views of an amazing rocket start🤩
It’s so impressive how reliable this technology is
Amazing Infrared footage!
salute to all hard working peoples in spaceX
Awesome launch videos particularly after sep. Thanks for sharing.🚀🚀🚀👍
SpaceX Can you guys show the Octagrabber one time do its thing?  It would be really interesting for many viewers!  Tx!
All the best to the new launch my support for this gong well
Thanks Youmei for hosting this and congrats to the SpaceX team for another successful launch. The view from the ground with the stage separation, merlin ignition and fairing separation was amazing and I think it was one of the cleanest image of the landing on the droneship we have ever seen! Congrats!
Thanks, SpaceX, for sharing the view.
They clearly show the rocket arcing back towards the level Earth
I never believed Santa was real, until all I asked him for was to see a decent looking landing on the drone ship without terrible buffering/pixel/disconnect/technical issues. Now I *KNOW* he's real !!
It was really cool to see how it goes faster and faster 😊
20:55 what is this?
never ceases to amaze...
Жаль опять наклонение орбиты такое, что из России спутники не видно(  Для нас было только два или три хорошо видимых запусков спутниковой группировки (май - июнь 2021).   Ну ничего, главное, есть, на что надеяться - вот когда starship регулярно летать начёт, полюбуемся на длииииинные ряды спутниковых цепочек. (Надеюсь)
When you guys go to Mars?
I love the intro music for this video. Who is it by? What is it called and where can I get a copy? It is so relaxing and dreamy
Literally, space X is crazy company. Elon is legend
Crazy
These images are amazing. Congratulations Spacex.
Gutted I missed it live
Loved the new infra-red camera views of 1st stage and meco. Awesome.
bravo spaceX, constantly pushing the boundaries
IL LOVE SpaceX BRAVO 😍😍😍😍
Just Awesome - C'mon FAA authorize star ship and booster testing , be impartial and not political , look at the great humanitarian work this company is doing!
I can't wait until all other rockets are eventually forced to go the reusable-and-cost-effective route to stay competitive.
damn SpaceX has launched 3 Missions only in the last 19 days
Awesome shot of MECO, 1st stage seperation, SES and fairing seperation
This just NEVER gets old! 👍😊
WE WANT TO SEE THE CAMERAS ON THE ROCKET NOT THAT STUPID GROUND VIEW WTF HOW DUMB VERY POOR COVERAGE OF THE LAUNCH
Tíz centivel a közepe mellé szállt le! Lehet gyakorolni.
First time they showed the more beautyful images of stage separation from ground camera!
Great images of the Stage 1 landing....
Great go ahead and dump a bunch of more junk into low earth orbit, these microsatellites are the worst idea ever they only last for a couple of years and then you got thousands more pieces of worthless junk floating around, thanks Elon.
Love the view of the fairing halves and stage 1 falling away from stage 2 and the split screen of the landing from stage 1 and the drone ship was epic!
They literally recycle everything! Guess someone was serious about their global warming easy
Soon you will barely hear anyone clapping in these stage separations or launches as everything would be routine and expected to work.
It's so extremely exciting that SpaceX team makes such an extraordinary thing like launching a rocket with heavy payload - just a routine being done almost on a weakly basis like it's nothing special.
falcon used to carry 60 stralinks to orbit, why the drop to 49?
Awesome job SpaceX
Wow, I am really digging the "new" camera shots and appreciate these no lag / loss of signal landings!
Does the new drone ship has some feature that makes sure that the video won't cut out?
I always see stage 1 landing and gives me same thrill as the first time I saw.
Its routine now, but it never gets old seeing them land.
Thank' for remember my. This is good work.
Excelsior!
Can't wait for Starship!
stick your starlinks satelits where the sun dosen't shine
super
The interlude music in SpaceX's videos is always so great! Awe and wonder, SpaceX is opening up an exciting future for humanity. 💯 The music in this launch video reminds me of the Beretonia bar music from Freelancer. Link here https://youtu.be/O4Pz3VCGcv4. Thanks SpaceX for your amazing work! ❤
I miss the RUDs 😅
SpaceX you guys have done over a hundred launches. can you please have a second channel where you show the launches without the yappy people telling us whats going on.
Beautiful IR tracking shot SpaceX!
صراحه فالكون شغلا مضبوط راح رسل اقمار ورجع في خلال 9 دقايق 🥺
Thank you again SpaceX for sharing this with us!
👋
Asombroso
📕 Stereo clip super effect ! https://youtu.be/B7RTx_KRr70..
This girl has a problem. She doesn't let other people speak, is like a parrot.
26:24 You can see the thruster blow for the last time after landing 😀
AMAZING! Congrats Team @SpaceX and Elon Musk -- Stoke to seeing the future taking shape before my very eyes!
Thanks for rootsy original   SENSE  SCIENCE  COSMIC SPACE  X VIDEO MUSIC  TOGETHER  GOOD LUCK   // RUTERENI- Irena Rute
Is it just me, or does the audio sound really creepy on this stream when Youmei speaks? Reminds me of playing SOMA, or, a probably less obscure reference, of the Borg from Star Trek.
❤❤❤🌌
Bravo à tous pour ce nouveau succès 👏👏👏
А что, в этот раз нло не было? Жаль....
That droneship landing footage was incredible, there was practically no stuttering or quality degradation.
19:10 at 1/4 speed.
I watch every single one of these launches. Makes you well aware that the private sector is far beyond our inept government!
Do only good everyday.  Dogecoin to the moon!!🚀🚀🚀🌝🌝🌝
That still does not get old.  Congrats SpaceX!
Come to think about it, I have seen all SpaceX launches since 2020. Never gets old.
Space x keeps amazing me everyday, that landing was soooooo smooth! And right in the center, BULL'S EYE SPACE X!
FAKEX!
Giving a shout-out to Youmei. Love it how she’s fangirling about the falcon as she talks about the propulsion parts, as the engines have to do certain tasks and they do that flawlessly. You can hear her excitement. Love it. 👍👏🙌
Auto land in pitch dark night.. Just supeerrrbbb!!!
IsFantastic🎩
Another top-secret weapon going to space.
YALL CAN EVEN MAKE MY SOLOR WORK AND YOUR SATILITES ARE ALREADY FALLING OUT OF THE SKY
Great to see it once again and what an amazing landing view of the Booster without signal loss.  But now a days, we were unable to see payload deployments (Last we have seen on NASA X-Ray mission) which is an another very cool view in space. I missed badly during transporter 3 mission where every satellite will split up one by one 😞
So satisfying and I'm so proud of Starlink successes👏
It is too bad that there isn't the option to just hear the call outs from flight control without the narration.
103 successful landings... And this one straight in the middle. Congrats @SpaceX You folks are doing amazing work. Respect for that.
When the rocket landed I half expected to see a team of robots scurry out and start servicing it! Maybe next time.
I wonder how New Glenn development is going.
Wasnt this the first landing without the cameras on the droneship passing out? FINALLY <3 :D
Still tears in my eyes, watching this! Thank You Elon, thank You SpaceX!
can't believe i missed a launch.
The Moorman photo taken at the assassination of President John Kennedy in Dallas TX. Nov. 22, 1963, shows Martin Luther & Coretta King, black Secret Service op Abraham Bolden and Andy Warhol standing with shooters on the Grassy Knoll.
What is it about these people that they get so many things right? BADASS!
No matter how many times I see it; I am wowed. However, for the general public, I think it has become "yea, another SpaceX launch". Just plain amazing. People have no idea how complex this process really is. Go SpaceX! Go Gwynn!
Wow... 2 amazing things with this launch... 1. Viewing the stage separation, and fairings at almost same time, from the ground camera, amazing 2. There was no loss of signal this time round when booster was landing!! 👍👍
Me now seeing other rockets successfully launched in newspapers: hmmm okay, who cares. Spacex has changed our views
This is the smooth landing view in this year
That 2nd stage shot from the ground was amazing!!!👍
SpaceX to IPO
Goosepimples every single time. Good commentary to today. Thank you all involved, on to the next one... and when Starship goes up... wow!
Another 10th time flight proven booster!! 😆
I thank the great SpaceX team for this achievement that brings all of humanity forward!  Congratulations to everyone involved for a great job!
The wifi on the new drone ship must be improvemed, since we saw the landing without any dropout !
Pretty awesome!
Please show more of the landing and time on that portion of the flight! ITS TRULY AMAZING TO WATCH AND EACH AND EVERY TIME ITS SHOWN OR WHEN THERE IS A LAUNCH. 👍🏽 I Can watch it over and over including the deployed drown ship(s) they are all amazing part of the operations! Great job Space X Team!
26:20 baby ❤️❤️
As usual Great Job to Elon Musk, his entire team ans Space X and everyone else from the Top to Bottom you all are all very important to each and every mission. Thank you all for making and bringing back respect to our space industry! BRAVO!
Great looking shot straight from the 321 🚀
I wonder if anyone's contacted Elon/SpaceX to see if they can send a batch of Starlink dishes to Tonga for emergency communications?  Their lone communication cable has been cut and could take weeks or longer to repair, leaving most of the nation incommunicado, and if SpaceX could get a bunch of these out to the government, they could then distribute them to local officials to help coordinate rescue and humanitarian efforts.
I can’t be a part of this adventure but I did just sign up for the satellite service so I guess I am - Thanks spacex
Awesome launch as always can't wait for more in the future
FINALLYYYY WE SAW A LANDING COMPLETE!
The best IR shot of the booster separation and the fairing halves   ever, well done
♥️♥️♥️♥️
it doesnt get old. congrats to another wonderful launch and land
NASA be like.....👀👀 again?
Another Typically Outstanding SpaceX Mission!  Im not even close to thinking of these launches as blasé, by any stretch of the imagination. Just as the vehicle is at the beginning of Liftoff, I'm always thinking, Fly, Baby Fly!!
when can we expect Starlink to launch in India?
do it in land and on sunny day.. so I can get a clear view..
I am on the waiting list for Starlink... hope it is good!
This just never gets old with these first-stage landings!
Well, just another day at the office for SpaceX. I used to be an astronautical engineer working on the Space Shuttle. Falcons don't have a tenth the operational capability but those vertical landings are unbelievable. Wait till Starship starts flying.
He is unstoppable ✨
Who would thought that one day a great guy would shoot so many rockets, so often into space that it would become boring... 😳
The launch was spectacular in person!!! With the full moon right beside. 🚀 🌴 🌝
congrats SpaceX, waiting to see you land on the MOON and MARS.
🤝
And keep in mind that the Starlink system has not even being partially deployed yet! I can’t even imagine what benefits the Humanity will get with the full deployment! Also, how does SpaceX manage to finance all these launches?!!
This never get old!  Fly High Falcon!
Another fantastic commentary from Youmei Zhou. Well done indeed.
😂
Skip intro 5:11
Long live space x
The enthusiasm is infectious!!!
That image where you could see the booster separated and both fairings and then the upper stage all separated, but all in one frame. Beautiful!
nice!!
It looked like it's going towards the edge of the drone ship and then boom bullseye. She's one dirty lady but a very hardworking one. Wanna see how many more she can do. Fly safe boosters fly safe
sadly , this is ruining astronomy, and astrophotography.
Since the entire world is probably watching your videos, maybe you could give times in UTC? Not everyone outside the US is familiar with your Eastern times and similar.
Amazing views. I love watching this every time SpaceX has a mission. I wish I could be there in person to see.
Great to see a live drone ship landing without signal loss. Does anyone know if they’ve upgraded their transmission systems there?
The SpaceX team is just awesome they make this look routine now but its far from it. Thanks SpaceX for keeping America in this space race and progressing the future for all human kind yall rock
26:11
Amazing just amazing. Love it!
That ground shot of stage separation was amazing. And the second stage hauling ass away from the booster and fairing halves. Wow, they're getting good at this stuff. Three flights in three weeks. That doesn't seem possible.
Never gets old!
Wow my farst and last wish spaceX 🇦🇫🇦🇫🇦🇫
This is the first launch I got to see in person! Awesome! Got to see 1st stage MECO, the time of staging, and 2nd stage ignition, and down range ascent through T+ 4.5 minutes!
Exito
Seeing the Falcon 9 lands for the 100+ time still amazes me..Never gets old.  Way to go spacex!
And the starlink moves individually like a chain reaction of multiple objects tied together , are they?
Being on floridas east coast it always puts a smile on my face seeing these things soar through the sky!
Excellent informative commentary.
Not even 5G can stop SpaceX
Do people think starman car dude is really in space ? I'm stuck between feeling crazy for not believing it and an idiot if I do
Psychedelic 🤯🍃
this is a camera testing mission
💛 Dragging us into the future... *THANK YOU!*
Guauuuu!!!🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
Wish I could be born few more thousand years from now. 🤘👊✌
wohoo
Loss of signal lol,what a lie,for one its national security to be able to monitor around the entire globe. Two spacex is deploying something it's owners don't want us maggots to know about. Elon is in the pocket of big government now
KRACUBO
20:40 its so cool to see all the separated components in a single shot (stage 1, stage 2 and the 2 fairings)
I love SpaceX Starlink, i saw one in 29 palm area
It blows my mind every time that thing lands, that was a total bullseye. Amazing.
ASOG showing her sisters how to properly stream a landing.
Maybe ask Kourou/ESA to lease you guys access to a base station in french guyana?
Space X has taught us all more about  orbiting the earth than anything nasa or anyone elce for that matter has. It's like they wanted to keep it a secret or a way to make us think we could never understand what they where doing. Thank you for all your doing and will do for a ungreatfull people and government.
Well done SpaceX! Mind blowing as usual.  Does anyone know why the orbiters go ‘loss of signal’ over certain parts of the planet considering SpaceX have thousands of satellites orbiting the Earth which could do the job, I would’ve thought?
Never fails to blow my mind, what an Engineering marvel it is.
I'm watching this via Starlink!  Great job SpaceX!!!
49 starlinks?  They usually carry about 70?  And no visual of the deployment?  They carrying a load for some else?
WOW! 🤯
bleep blurp
I'd like to think that Jeff Bezos is pulling his hair out watching these successful launches but....
😂
Nominal
HHHOTT....DDDAANNGGGG, KIDS, YA DONE IT AGAIN !!!!!!!
Did we launch more space garbage?

Jeff Bezos is the real life Bash
Elon, you're a living legend mate.
Living on the space coast has its advantages
Loved seeing the 1st and 2nd stage with both fairing half in the same shot is beautiful.  Like a little falcon9 family.
I wonder how many they have up there so far and if anybody is keeping track
Pinpoint accuracy on landing never ceases to amaze me
Just a couple yrs ago, the big news was if Spacex could land a rocket. Now, the big news would be if Spacex failed a landing.  This is what paradigm shifts look like…
All the SpaceX engineers at 26:24 heard the Wii Sport Resort Archery voiceline "Perfect!"
Yeah watching a 1st stage land back on a drone ship is never going to get old.  What an amazing time in space exploration.
Yes in triplicate please say it 3 times that way I will truly know about the soot. Or maybe even what the grid fins are doing.
Congratulations again and THANK YOU SO SO VERY MUCH FOR MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO STREAM THE FIRST STAGE LANDING UNINTERRUPTED. GO SPACEX, GO TESLA! I SHOULD TURN MY CAPS LOCK OFF BUT I'M JUST TOO EXCITED! :)
Always fun to watch.  I remember the Mercury launches. How I envy you young people and the things you'll do in space.
Epic.
Congratulations again! Great job! 👏🏻🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
I love how the landing flame spreads out just like it does in the 1950s Sci-fi movies.
For some reason, I now like death metal.
It would be cool if the fairing halves had electric propellers in them that could deploy and push them all the way back to land, using the chutes for lift and steering.
Just watched this from my backyard about 100 miles away and seeing it this close up is like seeing hair under a microscope
Nice
Absolutely beautiful IR views.  103rd Booster landing of another 10th use booster was amazing.   Congratulations SpaceX team, making history real time!
Russia and China are still in the 70s in terms of space vehicles until they can steel the tech that is.
I think this is Gen 2 StarLink sats going up. The first gen service has been almost flawless for us so far !!!!
Never gets old. Nice vibration damping on the landing camera.
🚀👏
WOW. WELL DONE!
Its total scifi every single time. 👍🤓👌
Watching through my Starlink internet!
Some awesome footage in this launch! From thermal camera to the full quality drone ship landing!! Love it!
Great coverage. I loved how the mountain ducked  @12:20
Soot is beautiful :)
Youmei was amazing.
Why don't spacex do tourist flights with dragon or with a similar capsule remaining attached to the falcon 9 seeing as the booster is so reliable on landing?
Nice views!
Space x have fixed quality of monitor camera , so we can see without delay
This is how Elon musk rich even nasa can not do launch rocket ever 1week and in 2026 Elon do lauch 3  of starship everyday to mars
LOVE IT.
25:54 Perfect 👍🙂 🚀
The live video improvements are as impressive as the actual Dragon launches.
Great footage of this one!!
Who doesn’t love this kind of Booster !!!
WOOOOOO! great landing!
Bezos needs to be strapped to a grid fin...
와 이제는 너무 당연한 수직 착륙이 되어 버렸네!! 대단!!!
Generally my favorite part is the stage 1 landing
Are both the drone ship and the first stage moving at the same time, or is the drone ship trying to be as steady as possible?
The whole footage are great. Well done SPACEX you did it again. GB all your team 🙏
bank in the middle of the landing circle
Start to finish is just AMAZING 😊😊😊
SPACEX is incredible, so much success. God Bless America 🇺🇸 It gives me chills every time I watch this. I was born in the 50’s, from the first flights around the earth 🌍 to landing on the moon 🌙  It’s absolutely incredible what you have done. Thank you for all you do 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Wow, wow, wow. This never gets old. I can't wait for Starship!
Why don’t you use the crane thing next to the spaceship to throw it into the air?
Hi
Is it more productive to send 49 satellites with ocean landing, or 46 satellites with a land landing.   Wonder what the cost is just transport stage 1 back to land?
WHAT A RIP!  Waiting for deployment…..annnnnd…… nothing
Never gets old! I've watched every launch and the shots of the exhaust plumes or RCS thrusters is beautiful. My Dad was an engineer with NASA Engineering and Development and died a couple of years after the shuttle program ended. He wasn't a drone collecting a paycheck, he was a believer and dreamer into our exploration of space. He'd be so excited and proud of what SpaceX has accomplished with reusable boosters.
Pog
the IR video of second stage was great, and one of the best drone ship landing coverage to date!  Thanks for sharing.
What is the count of starlink satellites in total now ?
Its awesome
All this cgi is stupid... elon musk is evading tax by having this fairy tales project... a few rocket launch to the sea and lots of cgi short movies... how easy to fool people is this age of internet
I’ll never get tired of watching the boosters land. It’s amazing!
I don't know why but the view today of the exhaust plumes was just amazing. You could really see them power and speed of this beast.
Can someone please ID the song at the start and end of the webcast? My Shazam couldn't identify it and I was wondering if it was Test Shot Starfish. Thx in advance! :)
Alright Starlink! Yeah brother!
Congratulations!
I wish SpaceX continued success in its collaboration with the construction of Indonesia's new capital city in East Kalimantan Indonesia's development planning ministry said SpaceX or an aviation company from the United States was eyeing the new capital city of Indonesia to be used as a launch site for high-speed aircraft. It could be said that if Indonesia wanted to go to America, it could take 1 and a half hours or 2 hours.
Gaga in a raft
Bulls eye!
Elon musk is this centuries Tony Stark.
I just wish they would show this in imperial units instead of metric. It'd be nice to see miles per hour and Miles up. I hate doing mental math all the time. That jellyfish effect though
I think the announcer is gorgeous.  She is smart too
What about doing some take offs from Central America
SO love that I can watch this via my Starlink connection!
Wow, a new view with the IR camera!
Woo hoo! Super nice landing footage.  Beautiful!
I live in homosassa Florida and me my daughter and grandson just watched this from my Deck it was so cool
SpaceX -  surveillance whole world.
Its crazy people believe this cgi bullcrap
So happy I got to see the rocket launch here from Ft.Lauderdale! Seeing the bright orange tail get bigger and then it just disappears!so cool! The second launch I’ve been able to see from down here
17:20 for launch 20:00 MECO and stage separation  25:48 for landing
press 6 to go to launch 17:29
Incrível

Talk less please. . .
Странно стрим закончился, до „Deploy“ не дошли
It really leaves Florida quick
Never gets old!…
Meanwhile, there are still people who think the earth is flat. 🤦‍♂️
20:35 first/second stages and fairings! Just amazing.
Awesome ground tracking views! Thanks for sharing! 👏
Please bring back the space tunes. I like listening to them while waiting for the deployment. And yes, I stick around and watch until I get to see the deployment. This new thing where you “post it to your socials” sucks.
There's youtube not notifying me of the live stream...again.
🤩
Congrats to Elon an crew
hi max hi max hi max hi max hi max hi max
Thank you for the vastly improved audio. The announcer is pausing to let us listen when things happen and sounds like she's watching and listening with us. The sound levels make the voices match. The choice of microphone keeps background noise low. You've done great, thanks!
Now THIS is what humanity really is!
hi max
Why do you switch from nas to lox after a minute? Graphite doesn't melt. Lab grown diamond doesn't break/shear. Let me help on the next design............... - LC
I've see it from here central florida 😍
That speed of it climbing is the speed of tesla stocks climbing ! Let’s go baby !!
103 successful first stage recoveries but how many successful ones in a row since the last fail? Does anybody know?
beautifull landing
@20:15 onwards is so beautiful. Nice new camera added to the feed.
Falcon 9 ? Good luck
26:17 Wow,the droneship camera is better now!!!!😱☺
Cool  thanks you guys
And as always, landing was beautiful. Host did a Great Job also 👏🏾
I absolutely didnt expect her to mention Slovakia lol, but nice
25:55 Unbelievable
Washington state fpv pilot here, how would a family man like myself land a career with SpaceX?
I remember the first stream this host did for SpaceX. She has improved greatly since then and does an excellent job now 👍
Excellent launch announcing by Youmei Zhou.  Well done.
It's crazy that SpaceX has landed several boosters now TEN times!! Even more crazy that Falcon landing has become such a regular thing that it barely makes any headlines. I can't wait to see how many flights these boosters can do!
Give us.   Not give up. 🤪
Love the landing as always... 🇵🇭
It must be cool to watch Starlink launches while streaming it via Starlink !!!!
Love the infrared camera footage of first stage and separation!
🎉🎊
Bota esse starlink para funcionar no Brasil
Hopefully this will give up starlink in the Philippines 🇵🇭
One headlight
This never gets old. Awesome!! GO SPACEX
Very cool, we had live video coverage from both the barge and the 1st stage all the way down.
I am missing the space tunes :(
Very nice landing video
25:54 - so awesome to see!! coming though the clouds and landing without signal delay!
Amazing
I'll never have enough of those landings
SpaceX does it once again! Perfect 2021 streak so far!
Nice
That was cool 😎😎😎😎
👏👏
first coment
8 launches in 50 days!
Absolutely amazing!!!
Thanks. Well done!
good stuff
