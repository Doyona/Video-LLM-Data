I find it funny when she says one thing and then goes oh no..and she means the opposite…she talks so fast she confuses herself. She seems like a really kind person and genuine. ✨
Looks so much better ❤ it made her lips protrude and looked unnatural
Dentist wanted to level my teeth all the same and push them in to close my mouth completely but I said I’d rather just stay natural me😅
I got mine only cause I lost my enamel so yeah but mine still need working on
I got composite edge bonding and I hate it and want it removed - This gives me hope I can remove it safely
so much better
What teeth whitening products do u use?
Well done on getting your natural look back. Gails should be inspired by what you are doing, the world is full of fake, but well done again.😊
Your real teeth looks so lovely way better than the fake ones!
I just finished S5 so that's why I'm here but you look adorable Molly Mae!
My 2 year old daughter is sat watching this with me and when you smiled close to the camera her reaction was “oh woooow” 🥹🥹 she’s the most positive little girl and gives me so much confidence. Your teeth are beautiful ❤️❤️
You look amaze
You are such a natural beauty, you look sooooo much better with all the cosmetic procedures reversed. All that filler was covering up all the beauty you already had.
How much were the fake teeth?
They look soo much better
Beautiful teeth look after them x
You look beautiful  with your natural teeth. It is just unfamiliar to you. It is rare to see such a beautiful natural girl these days. Many girls ruin their facev with plastic surgery. And you can not go back when the damage is done.
The natural smile is so pretty! Also maybe its just the camera but they didn’t look yellow to me at all?
I needed this! I want my natural teeth back after 5 days of having the composite bonding.
You look so much younger without the teeth and lip fillers 💗
Your natural teeth are beautiful!!
You look so good without fake tan and lip fillers. I’m not against it but imo she looks better natural which is rare in this era.
They're the whitest yellow teeth I've ever seen! 😁 xx
YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL!! Thank you for being more natural💚. P.S before you levelled your teeth they were still really pretty! It made them unique!
Wow she looks absolutely gorgeous
There is nothing wrong with your teeth they are amazing .
Just seen your video and You have lovely teeth. 💜
I’m so fucking excited that natural beauties are coming back!! Absolute queen.
Your teeth are great! Can't believe you ever covered them up!
That looks very nice
In the US we call them veneers
Your natural teeth look perfect. I wish I had lovely teeth like yours x
yellow as the sun     what      wow     dramatic as
Your teeth are beautiful. You have a great smile 😃 💗
Gosh your teeth aren't yellow! They're just tooth coloured!
You look amazing babe! Love the natural look 😍
Thank you! I will share this video with my wife. Maybe this will convince her that there's great beauty being natural as well.
The “natural” you is the best version of you 💜
I’d kill for your smile/teeth. You look beautiful honey!  You do what makes you feel good and happy. Screw everyone else opinion …not their teeth or life.  You seems to be a beautiful person inside and out!
You are so cute.  You had me cracking up when you left you bedroom.  I bet you look lovely no matter what you decide!!
Loved your total natural teeth the most! You really didnt need anything changed after that!
Beautiful!
You’ve got a great natural smile! I’m also glad you don’t feel comfortable vlogging in public - it’s not natural either :)
Great idea. You look beautiful. The more natural the better ❤️
You know what I'm not a fan of love island never watched it because I just think it's a bad show tbh but I have heard of molly mae and remember seeing pics of her and my god she looks so much better now. How naturally pretty is she though!? And I have tons of respect for her going back to natural because coming from a show that is obsessed with looks and constant judging people must be so scary of people saying nasty things... but honestly who can say anything negative  shes stunning and what an amazing example she is setting for young girls who think fake is the only way these days. Well done molly! Embracing and loving your natural self is the greatest thing you can do for yourself because self love is so important x
Your natural teeth are just fab xx
Your natural teeth are amazing! 🤩👏🏽💗
Do you use teeth whitening?
How do you whiten your teeth whilst your young x❤️
only just watching this now but honestly, you doing all this and feeling so confident and going back natural makes me want to do the same and learn to love myself the way i am. your literally such an inspiration and more people need to be more like you x
Molly you look great!
Molly they look soooo good😍
Wow I really didn't expect your natural teeth to be so amazing 😍😍
I want your natural teeth sis!

Hi Molly, can you do a video on how you are so confident please?
This is growth. You're actually growing as a person. It's incredible and inspiring to watch. 🤯
You look so beautiful so so beautiful I've just found your channel and have been Bing watching, I love your demeanor 💐 love all the way from Namibia
She’s literally so stunning and such a down to earth person
You look lovely Molly Mae.
wow, thank you for making this video, I'm literally in a similar situation, I'm gonna get my composite veneers taken off tomorrow, but unlike you, I have it for only 2 months now and I completely regret getting them... here's my story:  last May 2021, I've got my braces taken off (I've had them for 2 years) and I wasn't really happy with the end results/final look of my teeth. I mean, they're far better than they were before but still not as aligned as I would've wanted. Plus, I have very visible black triangles in between my front and lateral teeth, which really was my main reason why I decided to get composite veneers. So 2 weeks after getting my braces off, I've booked an appointment to get veneers. Mind you, I thought I had researched enough specially in terms of looking for the best dental clinic to get it done. Anyway, I went to my appointment and did the procedure. During the procedure, I kept telling my dentist to not shave down my teeth so much and she actually let me see how my "prepped teeth' looked like and they looked like nothing was done to them. After the procedure, as soon as I saw the result, I knew I didn't like it. And when my mom saw it, she said they look like dentures (she didn't know I got veneers, I only told her I got teeth whitening). I tried to convinced myself to like it but a few days later, I messaged my dentist asking her to remove them. But she told me, I should give it a chance for at least a few months. I ended up going back to the clinic a week later just to fix some of the issues I was having, but even after that, I still wasn't satisfied. But I kept it.  2 months later, now, at present. I'm gonna get them remove tomorrow, yay! A bit scared though. The reason is because, I was just flossing my teeth earlier and one of my veneers came off (in one of my lateral teeth), in whole, not in pieces. Initially, my plan was to just get it redone but then I realized, I don't want to have this problem like every couple of months because it's gonna be really costly. Then I looked at this natural tooth now where the veneer came off and it looks fine. So that's why I decided to just get all of my veneers taken off instead (I have 8 veneers in total, 7 left now). I'm still really nervous of what the outcome will be, but because of this video, it lessens that worry. I just hope that the rest of my 7 teeth are fine and that I won't have any further issues, aside from the black triangles. I'm just gonna find other solutions to that or maybe just embrace them lol. Good thing that I have 3-month warranty so I won't be paying anything for the procedure. Wish me luck  🙏 🙏🙏  Final note, to everyone who's considering veneers, make sure to do your research well specially in finding the right dental clinic and dentistm Make sure that you check their works properly and that you really like their results. Because that's one of my mistakes. I thought, regardless of who get your veneers done, it's gonna be a great result for everybody. Try to research if there will be alternative solutions to your issue that's less damaging to your teeth. Find a dentist who really cares. And should you decide to get veneers, I hope and pray that you get satisfied with your results 🙂🙂🙂🙏🙏🙏  sorry for the long story!
Fillers ✓ Teeth ✓ and finally a naturally stunning woman shines through 😘 You're beautiful from within.. Go get it girl!!!❤️
Lol re lumi spa
You are blessed with amazing own teeth ! Seriously they are amazing healthy and beatiful shaped! Just bleach them once in a while and you never ever ever need veneers anymore !!!!
Your teeth look amazing! You're beautiful Molly 😘
Your teeth look SO much better natural, and I think it’s so amazing that you’re inspiring girls to embrace their natural beauty! We need more influencers like you! 💖
Your natural teeth don't look yellow at all. Too white can look unnatural, as well.
Her natural teeth are perfect and they fit her face perfectly
Me watching Molly's old vlogs to get me through another lockdown ☺️ such positive energy 💜
You look younger too 😍😍😍
You look sooooooo much better with your natural teeth, they’re beautiful!!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍 suit you so much more - the fake denture teeth look is not nice at all 😵‍💫
Look so natural and young no need for anything glad you are dong this looking amazing
I’ve bin looking for a good dentist I need a honest opinion about my teeth
Her teeth her so perfect id love to have mine looking like that
Stop whitening your teeth! Sensitive teeth mean your enamel is being affected! At your age you shouldn't need it! Trust me! I did it and regret it so much! I had natural white teeth, till I used whitening treatments and it ruined my enamel! You really shouldn't even be thinking about it till in your 30s and only if they had stained, yours aren't so protect your enamel rather than stripping your enamel which will make them more yellow and staining from food and drink will stick to your teeth, young people really need to stop messing with themselves, it isn't needed!
Wow I wish i had such nice teeth
Composites are a journey? 🤯  You have no idea 😂😂😂
Ur natural teeth are so nice omgggg
Honestly I think you look amazing without all that anyways
I personally wouldve never put any composites on your teeth. Theyre perfect🤩
Honestly you are such a role model for all young girls and women. Showing how you are reversing back to your natural beauty when everywhere else girls feel the need to compare themselves to these ‘perfect’ looking women, which don’t really exist. Well done Molly!
Wow if you think your teeth are yellow mine must be brown...
Tommy's laugh😂
100% better molly , you look amazing totally stripped back to natural beauty, hair face teeth honestly your beautiful just you . 💝💞💕xx you and Tommy are a  beautiful couple xx

Pleaseeeeeeeee don't put them back on your teeth your so young you don't need them honestly if u did I would say  ❤️❤️❤️
Much prefer your own teeth beautiful you sound better too I felt the others gave you a bit of a lisp, whitening is amazing you’re a natural beauty MollyMae and I’m so glad you’ve gone au natural, just be yourself oh and come up for air lmao 😆 you talk so fast hun. I can’t believe people say nasty things to you it’s just jealousy, you have a hot Boyfriend and you’ve made a good life for yourself take care lovely 💖💖💖
You have beautiful teeth.,
Hi all. Need your advice. I prefer to drink coffee, and so want to have a white smile. I noticed a similar store www.shineevery.com which sells a kit for whitening teeth. Suggest who any used this device. Looking for reviews on it. Thank you all for the tip.
Please do talk about composite bonding and your experience a bit more x
Omg your natural teeth are amazing !! Thank god you didn’t have them filed for no reason
Babes your teeth are so cute
Love the natural teeth!
they look a lot better hun now they are perfect
wow i don’t watch love island or any  influencers really but i’m so happy at molly choosing to become more natural, she’s got such a big following and this has probably helped so many young girls realise their natural beauty 🥺
Why would we think your disgusting? Your being real 😘.  You are beautiful
Your teeth look so much better natural.  The other ones that you had looked too much for your mouth.  You are so beautiful and you don't need to do anything more.
Such a beauty, natural or not😍But you look more beautiful nowadays ❤ Love you Molly and Tommy.  I'm a fan from Philippines 💕💕
Okay the tag thing on the makeup bag is annoying me. There’s usually 2 strings going into the white cap thingy ( Jesus great explanation ) then only one of those two strings, has a cap you can see inside the white thingy and it’s super easy to pull out. I can’t explain it but look and you’ll see one string can be pulled and it’s the easiest tag to remove 😂😂
Your lips and teeth are gorgeous now. Anybody who gets work done it ages them. Natural beauty x
Tommy’s laughs at the start of the video 😂😂
I LOVE that every time Molly changes something big she doesn’t bash her past choices! even with her lip filler she always says that at the time she loved it and it was wonderful and I love that she’s not shaming people who choose to do things like composite bonds or filler bc she was so excited when she initially got them & it’s just not for her anymore at this point in her life :)
You look amazing and youthful! Your natural teeth make you look your age!
i love them!!
I like the natural you
I’ve just watched Anastasia kings north other influencers pick my Amazon order and the thing u got her is sooo cute lol x
What do you use to wash your white flannels?
please tell me what teeth whiting you use
Thank you for sharing your journey, its so lovely to see you inspiring natural beauty, you're gorgeous inside and out. :)
U r beautiful and so are ur teeth
she is 10000 times prettier now
It’s so refreshing to see such a young woman getting rid of lip fillers and getting her old teeth back🥰 she’s gone in the right direction👏🏾
You don’t need ANY type of enhancement, you are literally beautiful, very brave, and an amazing role model I have three daughters and would be more than happy with them following you, showing young girls what beautiful really is 💕
I just found your blog today MM and I love your back to natural. Don't listen to any haters, doing it infront of the camera is epic.
I bloody love your natural teeth !!!!! You are perfect I wish you could see it. Also I love how you are so open and honest about the work you have done , that is not common!!!! 🤩😘💯💯
Beautiful 🤩
you look amazing MollyMae !
she has nutri bullet!
I do forget she is only 21 which makes it even better that she has taken the decision to strip back the filler and composite bonds etc.  You look lovely Molly and you dont need to waste any money or potentially cause long term damage your skin or teeth with these products at your age!! I hope you're not tempted to go back to these in a few years as you're beautiful without my love. X
Good for you.. Much more nicer and natural
But - they’re so white natural? Mine are slightly yellow since we haven’t been able to go for the dentist in over a year now and I drink coffee. They were bareeely less than white.
Your natural teeth look incredible 😍 they're not yellow at all - it just may seem that way to you right now because you're used to composite bonding. It's kind of like when I had braces off, I thought my teeth were massive because I wasn't used to seeing the full tooth🤣 but honestly, you have nothing to worry about! 💖
Molly, your natural teeth looked super white even the day after you got the composites removed!!
Your natural teeth are beautiful. You're beautiful.
You look great!  I love the natural look!
I’m loving the natural look on you! You look so much more pretty without the filler and composite. And I’d kill for your natural teeth!
Oh wooooow your teeth are so lovely. Better than the composite bonds x
You are so natural beautiful ❤️❤️🙏🏽🙏🏽
Love the natural teeth more than the bondings 😍
Also I commented before I saw your teeth, your real teeth are so perfect!
I really appreciate what you're doing... like alot. I've been doing very similar things 😁 feels good and you look beautiful 😍
Yellow? They aren't yellow at all
girl you look so stunning🤍
You're amazing thank you for being so transparent xx
Defo not white but not yellow hun

Absolute hats off to you for going back to natural! I find it strangely cleansing to watch lol. Loving the natural look!! Everything you have done in my opinion looks better. AKA.... you are naturally beautiful!!x

Your teeth look amazing!!
They are still so straight & look more natural! Loving that the new vibes for 2021 are AU NATURAL ❤️
They are amazing!! Yellow? Omg mine Must be awful!😂😂they’re amazing
You’re teeth look great! They’re not even yellow. They’re just natural teeth. Your lips and hair look fab too 👏👏
Molly, I kid you not I could not tell the difference, honestly they both look the same and both look good. I love it, trust me I would not comment if I was lying. Thank you for changing the game of beauty 🥰
girl fr you are my fav influencer thank you for showing your natural beauty ❤️
Ew your so cringe!         Jk your amazing 💖🐸
So much better and white already !  Whats the whitening kit ul be using? X
Her American accent 😂😂
You look so much more beautiful with your own teeth! They are wite enough
Molly you look stunning!! now you’ve got your natural teeth back your character is just shining through, you almost look like a different person in the best way!
I will be sharing this with many many young people I work with who ‘cannot’ accept their true self.... thank you for being you!!
You honestly deserve the MOST! Have to say that it's amazing to see someone really teaching self love and to be the most authentic real you! Your family and tommy should be so proud of you ❤
Loved the vlog.
You have the most amazing natural teeth why would you ever put composite bonds on them.
Each video you look more and more your age and so beautiful ! I really love this self journey molly ! We admire you for loving urself in your natural form
Wait your teeth look AMAZING 😍
Also just wanted to say Molly you're beautiful in everyday xxx
Natural is the way forward. All influencers and young people on general should follow you 💛💛❤❤❤
I mean it’s good for her if she likes more natural things now but people shouldn’t take it as an excuse to bash girls who prefer themselves with fillers etc. Each to their own at the end of day but bashing someone for their choices related to THEIR body will NEVER be okay.
oh my god MOLLY!! You have always been gorgeous, but oh my gosh... you look SO beautiful when you just showed us your teeth after getting the bonds taken off. You look flawless. The true characteristics to your face are shining through and its beaauuttiifuull. And your teeth and definitely NOT yellow. It just seems it because you went from fake white to natural colour. (PS teeth which seem more yellow are actually healthier than whiter teeth!). But whatever you do to yourself you will always look gorgeous and I will always love you! You have such a beaut soul <3 <3
Your teeth look great and you do too! 😍
they’re not even yellow!!!✨
omg i love it 😍😍
Girllll wear ur Rolex AND apple watch ur Molly mae, it’ll be a trend next week😌
You’ve gone from Instagram generic same face to absolute natural beauty, you look so fresh!
Nothing wrong with your own teeth,you have lovely teeth.

Molly Mae I’m living for your natural journey.  You’ve always been beautiful, but you’re just getting prettier and prettier 😍. Your natural teeth are perfection and so white 🤩 Natural queen 👸🏼
This is literally amazing your teeth are beautiful! And I'm an orthodontic nurse x p.s your teeth are also not yellow !
Your natural teeth looks so good Molly!! Try using straws when drinking coke/coffee more often so you can maintain your teeth’s whiteness 🤍
You are amazing Molly
Molly Mae you are such a cutie🥰 I’m so happy you have a YouTube channel!!
Looking good
Good for you Molly, for being such an inspiration to everyone, especially these young girls that are so easily influenced. Natural is best, youve stripped it all back and your showing your natural beauty and that’s what it’s about 💗xxx
Wow!! It's so so sad that you sadly doubt yourself Molly-Mae.. You've FOUND YOUR TRUE LOVE!! Why oh  Why?  You are Beautiful inside & out.  There's sadly us everyday people that genuinely love you for you... But focus on what u feels best (which is the wrong decision)
Aww no Molly, your teeth look absolutely amazing. I hate the fact that you constantly have to apologize to people over silly stuff.
You go girl! 🥰
Mollie they are not yellow, they look great. Xxx
A million times nicer and not yellow!
As a dentistry student I can say your teeth look amazing! They’re just natural and it’s beautiful. I get the frustration with the color, but really soon you’ll be able to see a nice natural white as soon as you start whitening it 💖💖💖
i lowkey feel like when the two teeth at the sides of your front teeth were shorter it looked so much cuter like omg
THEYRE SO NICE WTF
:-)
Your natural teeth look beautiful!   Sorry you’ve dealt with some aggressive Nuskinners, sounds like your friends are doing it right though! It’s not a pyramid scheme and when done properly shouldn’t be aggressive at all! Xxxx
Molly your natural teeth are amazing I am so jealous!
Omg your teeth are beautiful Molly xoxo
You look great!!
Your natural teeth, shape, size, colour are beautiful! I prefer your naturals to the fake ones ❤️
So proud of you molly! Many of us have you seen in all your stages and I’m so glad to see you’re 💯 embracing your natural self (even though there’s nothing wrong with wanting to enhance yourself but never for the wrong reasons). Your teeth look wonderful! I think you’re just so used to the other teeth
I love when you said about going to the dentist and don't like vlogging but your gonna act like you always do it sooo what I would be like 😫😂😂😂💘
I havnt watched you in a while and HOLY.. you look like a completely different person. you look naturally stunning!!! just wow!
“Apple Watch makes me look like Ben10” 😂😂😂 honestly Molly Mae get into comedy
Your YouTube comment section is so much more positive than Instagram and I’m so here for it 🥰
they look amazing !
I love your make up look in your outro comment at the end!
I'm far too thankful for this video! I have wanted my teeth done so much  just because I want them white and a little bit bigger. But this has made me rethink everything and decided I'm going to save my money. I love your teeth and I'm going to learn to love mine❤
Look good your teeth do 😍
This journey you’re on to be more natural I ABSOLUTELY adore you for this Molly Mae! Lmaoooo @ “they’re yellow” 😂😂😂
Tommy is a whole mood 😂 Tommy should Make his own YouTube channel 😂 id be dead if he does 😂 ♥️

Your teeth look amazing molly xx
There is literally nothing negative I can say about molly, she’s such a bubbly person i love her. ❤️
when molly's own ad comes on her vid 😩 shes winning <3
Omgggg your natural teeth are sooo beautiful wow 😍😍😍😍
the more natural she gets, the more her age she looks!! I wish more young girls knew that staying natural only gets better in the long run she looks beautiful 😍
THE REAL QUESTION IS... Where are you getting your nails done???
How did you get your roots done? Hairdressers are closed
You have such beautiful teeth Molly !! And they're not yellow at all ! Not even saying that to be nice because it's the simple truth 🙈
Your natural teeth are much nicer 😊
Soooo much better Molly!!!! A good call having them taken off! You look beautiful and natural! You look so fresh xx 😁
I am so so so proud of molly mae honestly 😭😭❤️
they look so great, also they aren’t yellow at all lmao, it’s probs just cuz ur used to bright white teeth
Think your teeth are looking fab ! I love that you’re showing young girls being natural is best ! Good for you xx
Natural is the way forward.!! Good on you girl
Your natural teeth are amazing!

Tommy's intro 🤣🤣
AMAZING real teeth babe! ❤️❤️
Loved this vlog! 🥰
what a brilliant video i loved watching it and also i will always watch your videos they r amazing
She's naturally beautiful. 😍
OMGGGG REALLY???!?!?!  Your teeth are PERFECT!!!!  The shape of the teeth is perfect, no short teeth. And they're straight, you don't have a gummy smile as well and they're naturally white. Please don't ever touch them again. Just bleach but nothing more.  Can't believe you even had them done.  I thought you're gonna have short small teeth with spaces between and a gummy smile. I was shocked, they're perfect 🙏😍
You still look cute with your natural teeth!xx
😍
Quite honestly you look like yourself again instead of like everybody else. You are a natural beauty. Go girl ❤️☺️👍
i don't understand why she says she wants more natural teeth but then goes on to say she wants them white when literally pearl white teeth are the most unnatural looking
You look amazing 👍🤗
People have fallen more in love with her the more natural she's gone. I mean...that is rare!
I think you might have a bit of dysmorphia. Which you would after this, but your teeth do not look bad or yellow! They’re literally perfect, I had horrendous teeth, like you don’t understand, your next level critical on yourself. I also wanted mine so my two front teeth were longer than the ones either side, just shows everybody thinks different things are pretty 😅 My dentist wouldn’t let me go super white and I’m glad he didn’t now because nobody has ever been able to tell that my teeth aren’t real.
Ruh dental are very well known for the fake look. His work is great but never looks natural, many other dentists can obtain the natural look with still having an enhancement
You look great molly!! Also if you ever want a slight enhancement to your teeth but don’t want to go fully fake you can have edge bonding, go to maison dental or slaine smiles on insta! Such natural looking composite that still look like teeth xx
You have lovely teeth😊🥰
Omg, can you do a Fenty Eaze Drop review ?
Love them so much xx
You look absolutely incredible. I've always been tempted to go whiter with my teeth and bigger with my lips but your videos of you stripping back to natural is amazing and makes me feel so much better! Also your skin looks beautiful!
I love you vlogs😍😍
You’re so beautiful, I really hope you keep your natural look because you look absolutely fab and so happy👌🏽
You look so beautiful naturally and being yourself.  Love u lots 🥰
Trust me molly they are not yellow at all brushing them will brighten them fine, its just because you are so used to seeing celebs with whitening products or veneers
Literally one of my inspirations 🤍🥺

Why do I feel tired listening to this?
You look so much better without makeup!!
So much better without all that rubbish !!
They aren't yellow they look white but if your not comfortable with the colour shade then you do you and go get them whitened
loving the natural makeover, beautiful 💗💗💗
He'll upgrade soon when he fights a few more bin men 💀
Thing is that because tommy is fighting all the local bin men in his boxing fights with combine losses of 306 they're not taking the recycling 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Really ugly, amazing what makeup does!
Your natural teeth aren’t yellow. They look great!!! Go you!! X
I agree, the Apple Watch is an addiction which you can’t just hold back

Haha not sure why people are calling her natural  Lvl lashes (perm isn’t natural ) Dyed hair (not natural )  Fake tan (not natural ) Fake nails (not natural ) Had teeth chemically whitened (not natural ) Had teeth part bonded (not natural )   So sorry haha that’s not natural girl is just perhaps 10% less fake than her 200% fake look adorned earlier
Not a subscriber, I didn’t really watch Love Island either Sorry, but came to watch this video and applaud you Molly👏🏻  you seem a lovely girl and well done for removing the “too shiny teeth” you’re a great role model for young girls who watch you, It is so refreshing considering every “influcer” has the same filler face.  Tommy is so funny too!
as a dentist...     this the best decision you’ve ever made !
A queen setting an amazing example of influencing😍♥️♥️
hey Molly, i just wanted to say: you really do have a pretty smile :-) and they may have polished off the veneers from your teeth but, that sure hasn't slowed down your talking one bit lol still as rapid fire as ever :-) i really do enjoy your videos very much Molly, you do a great job :-)
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Your teeth aren't yellow and most people's teeth look like that and for u to say I'm disgusting for having yellow teeth you've made me very self conscious
"Yellow as the sun" is she for real 😂
Just come across your vid...really enjoyed it! Thank you. Your hair looks so lovely and your smile is on point 😁
i loveeee them
i’ve never hated molly
huuuh? they are not yellow at all.. you look amazing!
Your natural teeth are beautiful and aren’t yellow darling x
Your teeth are not yellow at all, your teeth are amazing 🤩 i used to do nu skin, thats one of the reasons why i stopper doing nu skin cause they tell you to basically hound people and i dont like that side I don’t agree with hard selling. Nu skin products are amazing tho. The lumi spa is amazing 🙌🏾 and one of my personal favourite products are the tea green capsules are amazing for loosing weight and the marine mud mask is so good too.  Id actually still do nu skin if out reps would stop telling us to stop hard selling xx
So gorgeous! Your teeth are absolutely perfect. Gorgeous shade, perfect natural shape and lovely and natural. You’re absolutely adorable and SO naturally pretty. What a lovely role model...especially for younger women! 🙌🏽♥️
we need more people like this!! you look amazing!!
You are so beaut Mol ♥️
Absolutley love the natural look ❤ so so much better x
your natural teeth literally look amazing! they don't look yellow at alllll
Well done. Your natural teeth are beautiful; not yellow.  You have had two years of looking at unnaturally white teeth.
you’re natural teeth are literally perfect 😍
i love molly but her going on about her “yellow” teeth slightly annoyed me- yellow??? where ???
"straight into my hand, straight into my mouth" is highly relatable content.
yu are INSANE😍😍
Omg I love your natural teeth way more 😱 you look beautiful 😍
Omg that last clip you look sooo Sophisticated and classy! X
I use coconut oil to remove my makeup.
Look like Ben ten 😂😂😂 I’m obsessed with my Apple Watch tho I look forward to the 1st of every month to see the new monthly challenge 😩
I am loving this natural Molly, you beauty xx
You are a beautiful girl 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Nella rose brought me here😁
As a dental nurse, this is so nice to see an influencer embracing the natural look, your teeth look amazing!
Are we not in a pandemic ?
I only know molly because of love island can molly Mae fans tell me did she have a big following before love island ?? I didn’t even know she was 21 !! Love her tho 💓
Oh wow! This is soooooo interesting! Of all the stories going on in the world I'm glad I heard about some influencer and her teeth.   Why do people watch this vapid rubbish? Why do people care about the ins and outs of other people's lives??
The laugh at 0:30 💀
Okay can we appreciate how brave molly is. She gets scrutinised on everything about her appearance and still has courage! MOLLY YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL NATURAL OR NOT right
You look beautiful! Your putting out such a good thing to woman that you don’t have to be fake xx
So much better. Your natural smile/lips are beautiful, the Dick Emery after a wasp attack look wasn't a winner. This is.  And you're very smart to have gone with reversible composite bonding, nor veneers where it's irreversible because substantial enamel and tooth structure are removed. It breaks my heart when I watch these  people, often very young, with really healthy strong teeth jet off to Turkey or wherever and get them filed down to stumps, often ended up with unesseary root canals caused by the trauna of the procedure before getting like 24 emax crowns.   It's not the aesthetics that bother me, although why you'd want glow in the dark false teeth effect is beyond me, it's that they've literally vandalised their mouth. Healthy teeth and gums aren't just for Instagram, they serve a pretty important practical purpose. Ending up with a mouthful of emax is setting you up for a lifetime of issues from gum disease and bad breath to decay, pain and more root canals. Plus you'll need it done over at least 5 times assuming you live into your 80"s. Just madness.
We need more young women like Molly Mae such a good role model yes you had some work done at a very young age, but you own it! I hope more girls see your journey to being more natural and realise that you don't have to have cosmetic work done to fit into today society. I  love your natural teeth they are white not yellow and they also make your lips look more fuller with being less. Top marks to the dentist three hours polishing that's good going. I'm a dental nurse so I know yellow teeth when I see them  and your teeth look amazing now 😍
I love that you’re so open about it! It’s not bad at all to make some changes if that’s making you happy, but I love your natural self!😍 thank you for this 😊👏🏼
YELLOW?!?!?!? Molly you are stunning!!! 😁🤦‍♀️👍
Who needs teeth that are such a bright white that they can be seen from Mars anyway 😁.
Your teeth look perfect ! 😻😻 probably even better, makes your natural lips look more plump too !
Chatting sheeeet!! You do have a lip fillers!!
I think you look gorgeous with your more natural look 😘
your teeth are literally perfect!!!!!!!! they’re honestly not yellow 😍
I love your natural teeth molly! They are stunning and perfect
Long live naturel teeth !!! your's are fantastic!!!
Omg Molly Mae Im your biggest fan!<3
You could eat an apple through the letter box with you're old teeth, you look so much better and younger now, and congratulations on the new sighing with boohoo, it will be mother care next 😁👍
I’m so happy for you. Your natural teeth are lovely
So beautiful 😍😍
Your natural teeth/smile are GORGEOUS BABES! Don’t be discouraged or disappointed. It looks different so it will take a minute to get used to it. You are stunning Molly-Mae
Molly it might be nice for you doing all this and influencing girls to be more natural whilst saying your teeth are yellow when they clearly aren’t, and how disgusting it is, is going to push people to get surgery done. You really need to think before you say it 6000 times
Your teeth look so much more fitting. You look great
I just love her energy
Personally, I love that you are moving in a natural direction and that you genuinely want to! Your smile is gorgeous!
i love them! you didn’t even need to get bonds for those 2 teeth!!!
Your teeth look so good!!! 😍😍
Soooooo much better 🧡
Woah! They look amazing girlie and are actually really white! Love these natural changes you are making, very brave of you to reverse what you did in a world where people are doing the opposite and taking fillers and things to another level!👌🏻 love you so much Molly-Mae💛
I love Molly she’s so sweet🥺🥺😇
Girl your teeth look way better now and so do you, in your natural style!!❤️
If her teeth are yellow mine are black.
Omg your teeth look so GOOOOD!! Also they’re plenty white, you don’t need to have them paper white when they’re your natural teeth haha
Absolutely love the new look .. you are a natural beauty,  I suggest to look after your skin and maintain treatments going forward...  Natural look is the way forward x
Tommy at the end is us watching Molly’s vlogs😂
When she said she’s only 21 💀 I had no idea! I feel so old now.
Wow you talk so fast...
You are soooo super gorgeous! Love your natural smile xo
they look amazing!!
I honestly love your relationship with Tommy😂 your teeth look so nice! 😁
Composite bonds are literally just filling material added to your natural teeth, they’re pretty harmless and definitely 100% preferable again porcelain veneers in terms of it being reversible and not destroying your natural teeth ☺️
Your teeth look amazing!!
she looks so gorgeous and youthful ❤️ no ones doing it like her
She talks a mile a minute and between that and her voice blabbering i cant take it
You look so cute omg! I don’t have a problem with enhancing yourself but showing this proces is also so important! Molly you look so good 👏🏾
⚠️She doesn't have wifi you ain't broke molly it's only like £15 a month!! CLEARLY your CHEAP AF!! and everything you get are all freebies as you pay for NOTHING‼  FACT 💅🏻
Not what Tommy signed up for lol
You've actually never looked so better 😍 the natural look is for you💕💕💕
You look absolutely amazing!!! You truly suit the natural look!! So fresh and young! Bravo xx
You seriously are beautiful especially naturally, please don’t be so mean to yourself 💖💖💖💖
Ngl you are actually hilarious 😂😂
We stan for a natural queen ❤️
You’re a natural beauty Molly-Mae, I always look forward to your videos, I’m obsessed with banana 🍌 and coconut 🌴 🥥 scents too.  you’re an inspiration, a genuine authentic influencer. The way you and Tommy care for eachother is so cute that omelette looks lush. 🥰 💖🌺
My mum whitens her teeth and she found  the highest whitening thing was to strong and made her teeth really sensitive maybe if you try the lower whitening it will help xx
I loooove the natural you babe 💕💕💕
They look amazing! Loving the more natural look!
molly is changing so many lives by becoming natural, thank you x

I promise your teeth are literally so white and straight!!! Just wait a month I’m sure you will get used to it, you are just used to the artificial white teeth
your teeth are amazing girly :) love you x
her natural teeth are so nice omg the colour can be changed but the actual teeth itself shape size alignment etc. it's perfection
my teeth are 'as yellow as the sun'...  ...Yeah... This is why 'influencers' are not good for young people or those struggling with image issues.
Eye cream before moisturiser :)
Ur so funny
I can't fill the void. Ahhh no matter how much I travel through YouTube my life just become a bottomless pit of shallowness.  Maybe I should star smoking crack Wtf teeth and pyjamas
Anyone know the nail colour Molly has on here ? :) x
Oh iiioł C c the ju i and oi  I iikiiii  i the iOS
Molly stop caring so much about what people think about ur appearance , trust me nobody sees what u see! Ur look good not matter what
Your teeth are stunning! And they’re really not yellow!
Your teeth look AMAZING 😻 I also think you should have Tommy in way more of your videos and do more vlogs about your whole week i know u do them quite a lot already but I love them so much💗
You look beautiful!
Awwwh love this! Also love your channel ! 🤍 from a girl with a teeny tiny channel ☺️🤍

Now you are even more beautiful, and this is what the young generation needs ❤️ They need to see that being natural is beautiful ❤️
"In this life we cannot do great things. We can only do small things with great love." -
Your transparency is soo beautiful, you look gorgeous girl 🤩🤩🙌🏾🙌🏾
She is a natural beautiful woman Tommy Is a lucky lad..
"Bit yellow, which is kind of disgusting"??? Tell that to the people who cannot afford aesthetic dental treatments, because their money goes towards the basic necessities. Ignorant child.
Molly they look white and the exact same as before
WE LOVE TOMMY VIDS 🥺
Having slightly yellow teeth is normal by the way xx
You're so beautiful but honestly you saying your teeth are yellow is ridiculous haha they're white! Where are they yellow? 🙄🥴
Just to say, my dentist says to avoid fizzy drinks, they contain acid and damage the enamel. Use a straw 😍
Your natural teeth look amazing, really loving the natural look 💖
Molly Mae is a queen
Love u and Tommy
I really struggle to see the difference apart from whiteness 😭😭😭 wish my teeth where that good naturally!
Love watching your videos, you’re so down to earth and ‘normal’ and hilarious 🥰
Love your natural teeth!!! Beaut
First of all I would love your teeth! They’re not “yellow” either! I think it’s fab that, as a role model to young girls, you’re going back to being more natural (especially as you really don’t need any of it anyway!) 👌🏻
1000 times better! natural is always better esp when your young! 😍 Too many nowadays getting everything done. Hopefully this will change their minds💭👌
Your amazing!!!
You are so genuine, love your videos!
You are so pretty, and your natural teeth are so nice.  I prefer to the bonds.
Hey molly. My mates Alex (Alexandru) and Lewis like you xx one of them has a gf and likes you lmfaoo
What do you use to whiten your teeth?
Literally your teeth are lovely naturally white. Not yellow at all. 😳
Any idea what nail varnish she has on?? 🥲🥺😍
There’s a BBC documentary on Multi Level Marketing schemes, if you were interested about learning more on how they can be quite damaging to people’s lives and just aren’t really that great to support ❤️
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Anyone else wish they had Molly Mae’s natural teeth?
Ur natural teeth are so nice
Her personality reminds me of Cacoe Potatoe if anyone knows her!😂
Pretty woman
They look great!
What a shallow sad person 😡😡😡
Personally I prefer the natural look. Fake just means you'll be disappointed after your Mrs has a bath.
I loved her teeth with the bonding but I love them even more now !!
Meanwhile there are people dying in the world ...how that fine bit of meat next to you puts up with you and that voice ...my god he needs a medal 🏅🥱
Honestly Molly your natural teeth are perfect as they are! Remember to be kind to yourself ♥️
I love them they look so much better now, and your lips look amazing. Just a cute look now. She has such a gorgeous face and it's so sad that as a your girl she was made to feel like she had to make all those changes but I'm so glad and proud that now she's a little older she's realised her own beauty.
Your natural teeth are stunning! You look so much better without the composite bonds. I hope you know what an influence you’re having on younger girls by wanting to be more natural!   You are such a lovely young lady with a beautiful heart 💕
Brb going to whiten my teeth and pamper myself. I needed this push to start whitening again I haven’t done it in so long! Sensitivity is a problem 😬
Your natural teeth look stunning honestly
And your teeth is like a shining diamonds 😁
Your smile like a sunshine 😁
I legit couldn’t tell the difference between her old and composite!!!! The natural teeth are so much better !
Your natural teeth is -wow,so beautiful 😍👍
Ah I feel like promoting calorie counting and step counting is a risky game 🤷🏻‍♀️ just my opinion. But she’s saying she’s obsessed with it. Obsession over those things isn’t healthy 🤦🏻‍♀️
They look great Molly ❤️❤️❤️
Your teeth are amazing, you defoo look good natural
U say that natural teeth look disgusting is that why ur teeth look disgusting after surgery now? Oh and what happened when u got plastic surgery on ur chin lmfao🤢
Omg your natural teeth are amazing!! Honestly best thing you did
Teeth look perfect!
So much better natural! 👌🏼
Ur natural teeth are so much nicer than the bonds !!! Loving ur more natural look
Your teeth are gorgeous molly! Embrace them! I wish mine were as straight as your natural ones x
they look amazing xxxx
Loads better 👌🏻 loving this natural look 😍
Hmm, you have blessed natural teeth. I have issues with retaining natural enamel so I will likely have to get composites done in the next few years unless I want to end up losing them. I've done well though, fought the good fight, my grandmother has the same problem and she had to have all of her teeth pulled at 18. I've made it to 35 only losing 1 molar, having a few fillings put in and a root canal one time. I can save myself a lot of future trouble by using a composite layer as protectant in place of my genetically pathetic enamel though.
🥱😴
They’re not yellow at all, WOW!!! Love it
Such a natural beauty moll😍🥰
Love how you're stripping it back girl!
Her smile is so cute with her natural teeth
Your natural teeth are not yellow? They are white, they are really white. I wouldn’t change them, I wouldn’t call the “disgusting” either because they are white. You are pretty.
Loveeeee
Looking great Molly!!!
who is here because of Nella Rose's video 🙋🏾‍♀️
Your natural teeth are so cute I think I prefer them to composites x also they aren’t yellow, you have to remember you’re used to seeing bright white teeth (even in magazine articles) so anything in comparison will look yellow x
Hahaha i think its so funny that her boyfriend of two years had never seen her real teeth
Wow you’re natural teeth are incredible they look amazing 😻
Molly why do ya talk so bloody fast babe. Slow down!
They look so much better!
When you get your teeth whitening please can you share what exactly you get done and the prices because I want to get mine professionally whitened xx
You look way more beautiful because you see it’s natural! Don’t be insecure, you look amazig!
Molly mae you’re lovely!! I love you’ve stripped yourself back because you’re a naturally gorgeous girl.
Your honesty so beautiful, its just the change you need to get used to like you did with your lips.  You are being what an influencer should be which is showing young PPL (Even older ppl) that they should be happy with their natural body (unless it's serveraly depressing you) You should be very proud of yourself for doing this and not being a sheep XxX
where is your whitening thing from?😍✨
Molly your teeth are not yellow at all it’s just because you’re used to how insanely white your composites were x you look fab
100000000 % better. Great message, keep going.....❤️
Does whitening works on the bonds?
Make sure you’re changing your pillow cases regularly!
Obsessed with your new teeth!! So so so much nicer!!! Still so perfect but so natural too :-)!
ALWAYS looks beautiful
teeth aren’t supposed to be paper white bc they’re bone, don’t worry!! your teeth do not look yellow at all, it probably just seems like it compared to the fake teeth :)
I loved u before and after but this all natural look is amazing, I love it! 🥰
Your natural teeth are lovely!
Omg your natural teeth are beautiful. Defo better than mine
Omg molly your natural teeth look sooooooooo good and they’re acc so white??? I expected them to look a bit darker but they look amazing
Loads better molly 😍😍😍😍 they look amazing x
Can I just say I love how your such a role model for the youngsters. Your showing that it's OK to be "you", we live in a day an age where changing our faces is so easily done and accessible and many young people feel they aren't good enough because you see all these perfect images of people on social media. Hats off to you for embracing you as your beautiful both inside and out. Well done xx
random but every video of yours I always think how your apartment has such cosy vibes!!
As yellow as the sun😭😭😭 they look amazing!
You have beautiful teeth weldone you for being your natural self you don't need any cosmetic rubbish you are a natural beauty
“Say hello Chickens”😭
Thank you Molly for bringing natural beauty back again !
You look in incredible Molly! 😍 As always! But I think I prefer the natural teeth! The others were a bit big! Fair play for coming on that's so brave! Well done! 👏🏼☺️
Molly you are unbelievable - without the teeth, without the filler, without the makeup! Absolutely unreal girl! 😍
I just think this is so admirable, leading the way for the generation below in the beauty world!
you’re teeth look so great
Molly, straight up ur teeth look way better ♥️👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 xxx
What have I just wasted my life watching this silly person for I wont say female because I carnt see 1
Honestly I couldn’t tell the difference you look beautiful!
I love you
Never mind the teeth sort that acne out
Not 1 person cares about your teeth you fake person
I don't comment on videos but your teeth are so beautiful 😍💖💗💕
omg your natural teeth look gorgeous!!! you’re so cute!
Beautiful inside and out ❤️
Omggg they’re gorgeous
You have beautiful teeth! All you need is to get them whitened. It’s so refreshing to see an influencer reversing the work they have had. So many influencers look like clones of each other and look fake! Molly you are so pretty and don’t need any of it x
A big social media influencer like Molly doing stuff like this, going back on the natural root honestly makes me feel more confident 🥺
You don't realise this but u made my day when I was in quarantine u make me smile and those teeth, just keep smiling! I love u so so much x
Idk why she thought she needed all those fillers. She looks really beautiful naturally.
Wow 🤩 your much prettier with your natural teeth 😍
Fazenda 😍😍
Omg have an op to change your voice love
Molly! <3 youre so beautiful, your smile is amazing! Thank you for sharing this <3
You look so amazing Molly❤️❤️❤️🥺
Warning; Here is how it will play out  1. If Jesus Christ comes back to take his church and found you not saved (not believing at him as the savior through believing he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and that he risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now) you will be left behind and there will be great tribulation you will suffer on earth and that will be God's judgement.  The only way to be saved at tribulation after left behind by Jesus when majority of Christians have disappeared is to not take the mark of the beast on your forehead or right hand and you will be killed or starve to death.  2. Death always occur you can die at any time and the huge issue is if you die before Christ returns and you were not believing at him as the savior( that is not believing at Christ that he was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and risen again on the third) your soul will go straight to Hell for eternity, at Hell you will burn but not consumed.  Realise that you deserve hell for your sins;  Romans 6:23 plainly states that the wages of sin is DEATH. In Genesis 2:17 God warned Adam and Eve that they would die THE DAY they ate of the forbidden fruit. They disobeyed God, but didn't DIE physically until hundreds of years later. Why? It's because they DIED SPIRITUALLY that awful day, and all mankind has been born spiritually dead since (Romans 5:12). Please understand that spiritual death and the second death are not the same. Every person who is not born again is ALREADY spiritually dead. The second death is Gehenna, i.e., the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11-15). All those who die in their sins, without being born again( that is believing that Jesus Christ got crucified and shed his blood for their sins, buried and rose again in the third day and alive now in heaven), will be arraigned, prosecuted, and sentenced at The Great White Throne of Judgment and then cast into the Lake of Fire forever.   Believing at Christ does not involve worship of other gods(church leader&ancestors), object(hand bands,car stickers,trees e.t.c) Muhammad,buddha e.t.c. It's only believing at Christ as the perfect sacrifice for your sins. It's your choice but know that rejecting Christ will send you the wrong direction.  Hebrews 10:4, 10 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.   Any other form of sacrifice be it animal sacrifices it can't save you but we are only saved through the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ.  No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what Jesus Christ did for you as simple as that.   Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.  Believe and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and was buried but risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now.   After believing at Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c.   Romans 6:12-13 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.  As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life.  Also grow in the word; I suggest the following YouTube channels; Real bible believers, Robert Breaker and Pastor J.D Farag..
They look amazing 👏
Molly your teeth are not white!! Loving this natural for you! Stunning.  Tip! If drinking anything other than water use a straw won’t stain teeth keep them nice and white. ❤️🖤
Is it me or does her voice has a high pitch now? 😂😂 ok im going back to the video 🤧
You’re so beautiful
Attention seeker
The message you’re sharing, is that it’s okay to be yourself. You still look beautiful, even more beautiful because you’re more natural. This will help so many people with poor mental health, who don’t feel good enough 🙂 I hope this encourages others to follow your lead. ❣️
Your natural teeth are so nice omg?! Please don’t feel insecure they look amazing
I think your really sensible stripping back and getting more natural, you are a beautiful young woman, and thus is an important message to give out to other young people.
Aww I just watched this while I’m high and I loved it sm so adorable 🥺❤️
Molly you have such a lovely voice 🤎
If I had your natural teeth or your composite bonds I would be so happy
It's so sad what social media does to people.
Babe they look good
Your teeth look fantastic!
they look SO GOOD!
Molly, you make my day everytime you upload a video. You’ll probably never see this but I just wanted to put it out there that I love your pure soul and your sunshine energy! You’re an absolute breath of fresh air 🌷💓💘

OMGGGGG. U look amazing 😍😍
What whiting trays does ur dentist give u? Is it philips zoom?
Literally the natural teeth are dream teeth they weren’t yellow at all and are perfectly straight!!

You can get a brace to give you a more fuller smile but I think they look so much better mollie!
Your so pretty ❤️
LoVE!!!! xxxx
Your teeth look great ❤️
Teeth are so much nicer now!
loveee it
I just love her. Like I LOVE her. If Tommy doesn’t wife her I will. I think he will though.
I'd strongly recommend checking out Dr Dray (US based) or Dr Sam Bunting (UK based) for product recommendations and skincare advice. A minimal, fragrance free skincare routine has done wonders for my skin.
Channwl
Such a natural beauty xx
Ur teeth look 1028748384894X better!!! Love love love and there not yellow at all lol xx
Does anyone know where this dressing gown is from? 🤔🥰
Your natural teeth look amazing
Your teeth are so much better xx
I really hope she’s done this because she wanted to and not because miserable people who don’t even own tweezers or tooth floss sit and write horrible jealous comments. Molly u look beauts regardless love!
They look amazing!!!! Must nicer. You look fab 😍
Natural is the best way to go😅
Loved this video the hydrating lips comment 😂
Molly I love u with out super model teeth and lip filler and with like it doesn’t rlly change anything tbh if anything I love your going back natural and putting a good influence out there for the younger generation❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You look (and always have looked!) amazing 🥺❤️ lots of love from Sweden x
Omg 😍 amazing!!!
Cutie !
I really don't understand why you are so nervous about your teeth Molly.  Your teeth are lovely.  Straight and naturally white as opposed to scarily dazzling white prior to having them removed.  Your real teeth are so much better.  I really do not like the fake white veneers look, it is a bit naff.  Be confident, you look great.
i'm in love😍 their beautiful
Molly Mae I like you a lot more when you are this natural looking with no hair extenstiins, no fale teeth and lips 👏👏👍😀😀😄😁😆😊😉😍😘. When you are naturalny beautiful, you dont need this much fakery.
You look A MA ZING babe!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ok your natural teeth are perfect 💗 💗
hey molly mae i just anted to say ur amazzing and never let anyone bring u down x ilysmmm
molllyyyyyy you are so entertaining i love watching you !!!
I love them 💜
Amazing set of nashers 😍
Everyone has breakouts so dont listen to those who say it isnt when everyone’s skin is different  and some get it worse than others.. a breakout is a breakout.. im 30 and for the last 12years since having my 1st child ive been using savlon as a face cream at night and in the morning and i honestly cant remember the last time i got a spot 🙌🏻  your teeth look amazing too 🙌🏻 xx
they're so much better for you Molly !! they perfectly fit your face and you totally suit them - completely ! so please don't feel insecure (oh and they're not even slightly yellow !)
You have inspired so many young people to learn to love their natural self you are an inspiration 💜
Honestly i cant tell the difference, your teeth look great.
If your natural teeth are yellow..... mine are cheese puffs
❤️😊❤️😍😍👍
tommy’s laugh 😂
They look gorgeous xx
Gotta get that leg thing looked at...just remove it? 🥰
Hello chickens 🐔🥰🥰🥰🥰
Can you do a video on all the skin care products you use !! In need of some good ones but don’t know what to get 🙁💗💗💗💗xxxx
I just realised she’s only a year older than me... I need to get my shit together
❤️❤️
She’s used to the super white bonds so I can see why she thinks hers are yellow but for natural teeth they’re super white!
100 million sharks 🦈 are slaughtered every year just for shark fin soup 😥
110 % better .... I don’t understand  the thing for shiny white veneers and bonding etc as you can tell x
Not related but Jesus loves you all and wants to save you from hell please accept him before it's too late but it is your choice and you are free to do as you please but there is a consequence,  He died for your sins and you have to do is accept His love and grace❤  because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9 ESV
They’re not as yellow as the sun they are white
Hi Molly just wanted to say that you look the most beautiful now! Well done for removing it, I know it must have been hard. You’re an inspiration to young girls and showing them that natural beauty is 100%
Natural teeth > fake teeth. Look amazing
girl your teeth look amazing!
I need to go to the dentist for treatment , but too scared to go with Covid
Love your teeth 🦷 they look so pretty and your so gorgeous to xx
Thank you for sharing! So important to highlight natural beauty too, especially for young girls!✨
I KNEW SHE WAS GNNA DO THIS AYYAYA
Teeth brighter than my future 🤦🏾‍♀️ love you babe
This is why Molly Mae is smart - she didn’t file her natural teeth to the stumps just to have new teeth. Smart girl. All the changes have been reversible 👏🏿
This girl I'd vile and self obsessed to the max, however she looks normal now and alot better
Your natural teeth make you look younger xxx
Not me going to get my bonding done in May😅
Love how your going back to natural love the natural look on a woman and especially you beautiful 😘
Molly looks so much more natural in every video she does... stunning then and stunning now! Natural queen 💕💕
WE LOVE A NATURAL QUEEN!!🥰😍❤️💗
Your teeth look fantastic and balanced with your natural lips
Hi girl ...I never comment but you natural teeth looks amazing ...thank you for your videos...
How can she say her teeth are yellow lol, if hers are yellow I duno what mine are
You have such great, straight natural teeth!!!! Sounds weird but you look so much more refreshed!
Those teeth are not yellow! Youre just so used to a really unnaturally bright intense white of the composites... your teeth look fantastic
So refreshing to see someone returning to a more natural lool rather than the opposite. Nothing wrong with changing one's body but I just find it refreshing as a viewer :) your natural teeth look amazing btw
Natural molly mae >
They’re totally not yellow! Lovely transformation ❤️
Hi molly mae you are so pretty your house is so good and your have the best hair and Tommy is so funny

Your such a true inspiration seeing you strip down to being all natural! Your teeth look fab 💖
Your teeth are literally AMAZING! You look 10x better, you look stunning!!
✝️For God✨so loved💖the world 🌎 that he gave his one ☝🏽and only Son 👤 that whoever believes 🛐 in him shall not perish but have eternal life✨

Molly thinking her teeth are yellow Me watching this video and looking at my own teeth 👁 👄 👁
Molly you look amazing! You are so pretty being the natural you, you are 💖
Wtkxzvbm
They are perfect 🤩
✨
You have so much more Charakter now. And I don’t mean it in a bad way. But look you look so much more unique. ❤️
I’m I the only one who thinks her teeth look no difference? Like I cannot tell the difference
I love your teeth. You look so cute. 😍😍😍😍
ur teeth aren’t yellow they r so white
molly instead of whitening doing little things like fluoride mouth rinses and having xylotil mints after meals will really strenghten your teeth and in doing so naturally whiten  them too xx
gorgeous with or without 😍😍
umm it’s making me insecure when she says her teeth are so yellow but they’re literally white so mine must be so bad 😭
Tommy's laugh at 0:46 tho! 😂
This was so hard to watch, going on and on about how “yellow” her teeth are 🙄🙄🙄
they really are not yellow tho
What is the teeth whitening kit Mollys using? Does anybody know?
You look beautiful 😻
Dont hate ur teeth there beautiful even though they look fake no need to change if u want change it I ain’t saying no and Ilysm ur such a inspiration
babe your teeth are perfect
Wait your natural teeth look great!!
look way better without the plasticy fake gloss look. so 2009 and idk why people still so obsessed with the barbie/fake/porn look. Keep up the natural even if society makes girls feel like they have to change everything about them till they looking like a lego clone. Its not beautiful but you are. Well done mate
Now I feel I need bonding beside my 2 front teeth 🙄
I can relate on the eye cream topic a lot, but apparently, what they say, because of the age, it's preventative, so you won't really see much. Sadly. It's just hoping it works and we'll see when we're older 😅 same goes with a lot of other skincare products, like hyaluronic acid etc.
Before: stunning  After: stunning
With whitening look for toothpaste that has Arginine - this blocks the pores that contains the nerve
molly what an inspo you are :) love u girl xxx so gorgeous x
Honestly they aren’t yellow at all 😂
Oh my gosh your teeth are perfect!!! 🥰🥰🥰
Your teeth are white naturally, fake white teeth are not nice!
Only reason why Molly thinks her teeth are so yellow right now is because of the composite bonding it’ll take time for her to get used to her natural smile again! Condition of her teeth right now is immaculate! 😍
British accent is just❤️. Love from India🇮🇳
Everyone saying that her teeth are not yellow and they look so white, its probably just because shes noticing a major difference between the composite bond teeth and her natural teeth. Regardless she looks so amazing natural or not, and shes putting out a brilliant message, loving your videos atm Molly :) x
Your vids make my day 😍
Molly you are gorgeouuuussss pls can we be best friends 🥺😍💘
Natural teeth all the way! Absolutely gorgeous & suit you far more 🥰
the natural you is sooo pretty!! u r perfect no matter how <3
This was amazing 💖
Molly learns.to drive would be a good subject xxx
Your teeth look so good!!! ❤️
Your teeth look lovely.
If she thinks those are yellow then idk what mine are
Bloody gorgeous lady!! Glad you are embracing your natural self Molly! ❤️
🇬🇧💖
My name is molly
Ur teeth look perfect. Love watching your vlogs you are so open and honest about everything. Xx
You look so beautiful natural Molly! 😍
Your teeth and smile look so much better! Before I always thought your smile used to almost look too large for your face but now it all looks proportionate!
Obsessed 🥰🥰
i didn't even see a difference with your teeth, still looking amazing!!
They look so much better gone. Love the natural look.. so pretty  x
Honestly you’re too funny 😂😂
your natural teeth are AMAZING wtf. they're honestly so much nicer than the bonds, they suit you so much especially now you've taken your filler out. you look beautiful!
NOT ME REPEATING TOMMY LAUGH 100X CUZ I WAS DYING LAUGHING FROM IT
Can we have an update on your mole situation. Hope it’s all okay now!💖
Your teeth are absolutely amazing 😍❤️
Does any one know how I can get my teeth whitened ( stuff that actually works) for not a ridiculous price ? X
Lovely vlog as always. Just wanted to comment about NuSkin - it is an MLM and I think there’s a number of “influencers” who casually sell them with a code but don’t put anywhere near the effort most reps do as they don’t need to as people will buy it from them because they like them. Eg you could probably sell bagged dog poo because people love you 😂  The lumi spa isn’t revolutionary for skincare, it’s just a device that can help you cleanse. Double cleansing gets all the grime off your face just as well
God I wish my natural teeth were as white as yours 😂 they look amazing 😻
Tommy's laughs at the beginning I love it
Your teeth look great but can we stop saying yellow teeth are "disgusting", they're actually a lot healthier than whitened teeth
With or without you are perfect!! I am living for your more natural look. Not that  it matters what others think. But rock it hon xx
What is the procedure called you did with your teeth? What did you have over them before you let it remove?
You're so naturally pretty!! 😆😆
Looking absolutely stunning❤️
I just luv natural molly way more
Your teeth are perfect!
Beautiful teeth before and after boo!!!!
Ur teeth look unreallllll
Yellow? No no no they look great😍
Love love love the natural look! You’ve really made so many people feel so positive about them self getting rid of all the filler and bonds! I think it’s a bit fkd how many people have so much work done and try to pretend like they don’t, really breeds horrible body associations! I wish more influencers would too! I think you look beautiful! Xx
Thank you so much for being honest about products etc we really value it 💛
Your natural teeth are perfect!! 💕😭 I wish mine were that nice naturally
You were beautiful before ofc but the natural teeth suit you SO MUCH they look so lovely
I actually feel so sad that you felt like your perfect teeth weren’t good enough! They are so straight and white (not yellow) !!!! Just shows the pressure on young girls:(
What I would give if I had my natural teeth that looked like that😍
Omg you look incredible! Love the natural look & your teeth are so good!! X
Wow what a lovely down to earth person you are. Your teeth look amazing.
6:33 nice job there telling the girls that watch you that having yellow teeth (which is the natural colour of them) is disgusting- another insecurity to them to have 👍🏼
I feel like your teeth look no different to be honest. However it’s good you’ve gone more natural on them. Also they don’t yellow at all 😂
Molly the more natural you go the more beautiful you get, it's insane.
I think its not the wanting to look more natural but in your journey of self love and confidence, i feel like you are becoming really comfortable with your own skin and stuff you were insecure about years ago, now youre embracing it and loving it. We love to see it
The less fake you get the prettier you get to me anyway,Girls should be more natural it’s annoying !
Don't worry babes, teeth aren't meant to be bright white naturally. But they look amazing ❤
Still can’t believe your only 21!! 😮
Your teeth look so much better
THANKYOU molly for showing girls that they don’t need filler / new teeth to be beautiful. You’re GLOWING🤍
They look so much better! Gorgeous!
I love this whole natural journey 💛
your teeth look really great!!😍
That lumi spa cleaning brush is a rip off. You can get the exact same tool from TKMaxx or Superdrugs for like £20 instead of £100+.
awww they look so much better, its natural for teeth to be a bit off white. These super fake bright white teeth are unnatural. We have been accustomed to expecting healthy teeth to be as white and shiny as the celebs on TV but in reality tea, sugar , coffee and general life will cause them to be slightly off white! and its NORMAL!!! <3
Teeth were perfect before, there’s no difference. Only did this as an ad for them
Your teeth are not yellow at all! Beautiful!
Wow!! MollyMae you look absolutely amazing what a natural beauty you are 💐
First of all I hate em HAHAHA... I laughed way too hard at that
HELLO CHICKENS
Your natural teeth look sooo much better! Proud of you for taking the leap
Your look amazing, I definitely prefer the natural look on you 😍
Gorgeous as usual Mollymae 🥰
I feel like now you definitely look 21 Molly! Your teeth look good!! 😍
Molly I love watching your vlogs even if it’s only your skincare routine etc. You and Tommy are so so entertaining ❤️ Lovely to see you’re doing well  x
You look so much better with your natural teeth, they are beautiful anyway dont know why you were hiding them
Please someone drop the Apple Watch layout ! 😭
OMG!! Your teeth look amazing!! It actually looks much better than before 😊
https://youtu.be/bFue7Vcu_v0
YOUR BEAUTIFUL
I don't think your natural teeth are yellow at all, mine are horrendous compared 🤣
Molly seeing this comment and liking will literally make my day 🥰🤥🤨
Beautiful. Amazing. Love this journey. You are a gem!
Look so good!! Your natural teeth are lovely 😍 you just went from bright white hence why you aren’t used to it! But your natural teeth are not yellow!
molly really does look so naturally beautiful, dissolving all her fillers was such a good idea she’s literally glowing
You are so beautiful you don’t need to be insecure about your teeth, you make my day with these vlogs ❤️❤️❤️❤️
How she closed that video without showing off the Prada coat I do not know😍
Having such white teeth for 2 years has made you think your naturally GORGEOUS teeth are yellow. They definitely are not, you look amazing as you are <3
Your natural teeth are amazing and they fit your face better.
i love this girl
Your natural teeth are sooo pretty!! Love this look on you!
Yay!! All for the natural journey 🥰 Your teeth don’t look yellow on the camera xx
I love how you look now 😍 Love from Kosovo ❤️
Ahh I love the ending to the video 😂 also  your teeth 😍😍
Teeth are beautiful 🥰
They look so much better! 😍 I Duno how she’s not sure about them haha!
0:40 Peter Griffin & Crusty The Clown Enters The Vlog
I love this woman so much xxx
Wow your natural beauty really shines through without the composites overwhelming everything, you look so stunning molly 😍
I love that you’re becoming more of a natural model, not a lot of that out there, really love it ❤️stunning either way tho x
you look beautiful molly xx
she looks amazing honestly! she is the first YouTuber I can say that gives such a positive message to young girls/teenagers, keep it up girl ❤️
Whaaaaaaat your natural teeth are literally perfect?!
I feel like so many young people who have shaved their teeth down for veneers are gonna regret it in a couple of years
I love them💗
I love your videos Molly!!🤍
It’s crazy to think like these arn’t  ‘white’ like vaneers and bonding. But they are white! It’s just that we are used to looking at people with gleaming white teeth. She looks gorgeous xxx
Molly I admire you so much for going more natural & sharing it.  I’ve supported you from day 1 and I’ve always personally preferred your natural look and thought you were stunning!  I totally can understand why you did what you did,  I can’t even begin to imagine the pressures that come to look ‘perfect’ being an influencer.  You look bloody gorgeous girl! Inside and out! Don’t u ever forget it! Xxxx
Molly you are making quarantine 100% better x Thank you sm for your videos and love how you talk to us like you know us it’s so lovely😆❤️ btw you’re so gorgeous!!
YESSS Finally the natural beauty you always were 😍😍 also so random where is your carpet from😭
She looks so cute natural
I know it’s a complex you have but your teeth are literally perfect, straight, white etc so I can’t understand how much your putting yourself down... yellow teeth aren’t disgusting, teeth are not meant to be naturally white x
I feel like people, especially girls, need to stop being so negative about their natural look. It’s really great that you are going more and more towards your natural you, but stop being so self conscious about being just natural..
Your so beautiful
You should do a review on your Apple Watch?
Ditch the make up Wipes and use a cleansing balm instead, your skin will be soo much better
Love island fame go brr
Your teeth look so good! They’re not yellow at all. X
Looking amazing girl, well done for taking the journey for a more natural look it’s good as young girls do look up to celebs xxx
Wow you look great!!!!
Wow! Your natural teeth are perfect, why did you ever cover them!
All the people watching this who have just been to turkey and had their natural teeth ground down to nubs 👁👄👁
Wow, she got so used to the unnatural PURE WHITE colour that she thinks normal teeth are yellow 😩😩😩
There not yellow
Gorgeous inside and out
Will they still be white after or do u get to see it at end hope there nice x
Who does your nails in lockdown?
anyone else thinks she's lost so much weight?! she looks insane (obvs looked amazing before as well but she's been working hard on her figure recently and its really showing)💞
This is what you call an influencer
Ur teeth are soo not yellow there really good,😍 so much better molly❤
YOU LOOK LIKE SUCH A CUTIE MOLLY🥺😍 soooo naturally beautiful❤️ setting such a lovely example for young girls to love themselves!!🥰
Mollie saying her teeth are yellow I was like omg I would love white teeth like that
I prefer your own teeth 🤗 you look lovely either way xxx
I'm so confused!! What does half 10 mean when a Brit says it? 22:30 or 21:30? In German you say halb zehn which means half 10, which means 9:30/21:30. Also in Afrikaans we use it like that.
Great natural teeth!!! The composites looked too big for her mouth I thought - I thought she'd had veneers and in that case, you're buggered because you can't go back from that unless you got smaller ones. Good job she didn't go down that route and ruin what a lovely set of natural teeth. Great size, great shape, wide smile, white! She can always get them whitened...these big hulking white teeth that everyone is dying to get look pretty ridiculous, let's be honest eh!!! She seems a great lass, I'm not what you'd say is a Molly fan, but I'm an avid procrastinator and find myself watching these videos working from home haha. Brilliant to see someone with her influence potentially putting young women off enhancing themselves when unnecessary and embracing the goods they've got.
what is this bullshit
I can't stop laughing at the 'Beethoven' description 😂 Thank for the laugh and the realness
if they are yellow i am in trouble..lol they look great.
“HELLO AND GOODBYE”
She looks way better
ahh ur teeth look amazing
Love the natural look you don't need anything!💛
Wow she looks different 🤔
Molly seems like an absolute sweet heart🥺
You look amazing! Naturally beautiful!
Your teeth look soo good natural I hope you keep them!
You should try tropics skin care it’s amazing
Your teeth look so much better 😍
This is a such a gorgeous look 😘
I have to say, its really amazing and inspiring to see an influencer going back to their roots and just embracing their natural beauty. So many famous women and even men do so much to make themselves look like this unatonable beauty that ends up giving the people who follow them insecurities. You are beautiful both ways but thank you for showing us that the way we are born is just as beautiful <3
If yours are yellow then what the fuck are mine 🤣
Molly you look so gorgeous loving this natural look on you!! the teeth look 1000% better :) x
Mollie: YeLlOw more like WhItE Me: BrOwn
you look so prettyyyy
So much better
BBC did a documentary on Pyramid Schemes and NuSkin is one of the biggest. Pyramid schemes are illegal in the UK so you deffo did the correct thing by not linking it down below. Selling the product isn't illegal, but recruiting people to sell it is!
Your teeth look gorgeous xx
Molly mae is a queen!!!! That's it!!!!!
Your natural teeth looks amazing 😍

How do you whiten your teeth at home x You look stunning babe xx
Molly is such a sweetheart😍 You radiate positive energy and am always here for it
your teeth look so good!! both before & after
uk teeth whitening suggestions anyone?

Molly I am so pleased you are going back to your natural beauty, you’re such a gorgeous girl. Love to you and Tommy, take care 😊

Omg perfect teeth! You look amazinggggg <3
Your natural teeth are banging
Looks so good
Nice vlog! You look like the Original Molly may who filmed hauls at her home lol 💗👌🏼💖🎀
i dont know but i love love loveeeee molllyy you are such a cute person🥺🥺❤️❤️
Oh wow I must say I tried being a YouTuber myself and I failed... So when I say Molly - Mae you GOOD at this I really mean it... Love from South Africa 🇿🇦❤️
You are so so beautiful
Your teeth are so so cute!!!!
It’s crazy how different Molly’s insta fan base and YouTube fan base is!! Honestly don’t know why she gets so much hate on insta😭😫 Us YouTube subscribers will always support and be here for you Molly!!💗💗
yesss the pyramid scheme "businesses" are lowkey toxic and so aggressive. I know someone who once got a message from someone they hadn't talked to in YEARS who said they noticed she could stand to lose some weight and would she like to try this fat-melting smoothie? like wow what a salesman 🤩
IM SORRYYY? They look amazing omg
I love seeing women like Molly go back to their natural selves we love you for you..your beauty is a bonus❤️🥰
Your smile and teeth look amazing! They’re not yellow at all
I've never watched this lady's videos. can someone tell me what kind of accent she has?
Looks beautiful
I like your teeth the shade they are. Too white just looks artificial and that's what you are try to avoid.  You look so beautiful more natural xx
Your teeth look amazing!  Leave them alone as they look so beautiful.  I feel like Maybe lockdown is getting to you!  They look great!! ❤️🇺🇸🌹💜✝️🌸
OMG!!! Your natural teeth are absolutely perfect and look amazing! This new/old you is breathtaking
Big up yourself
I love your natural teeth & you look like you have lost weight ! 🤍
i LOVE how much she is pushing natural beauty. we all have it, none of us *need* fillers/other treatments to make ourselves look nicer. and mollymae is one example of this. while I think she looked iNSANELY pretty with the fillers etc, i much prefer her without; I really think her natural beauty shines through. thank you mollymae for pushing such things to a wider audience! it must not be easy, considering how vulnerable you're making yourself to potential haters, but it makes a difference to a lot of us, including me.
Jesus loves you
Your teeth are a lovely white; don’t whiten them they always look so fake whitened. They look lovely
You are soooo freaking cuteeee🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
are we going to talk about how you are already at 1.5 million subs!?!?  you look amazing, love the random vlogs ! x
I didn't notice it was yellow before
You're teeth look amazing!!
Your natural teeth are literally PERFECT and not yellow at all lol
they look MUCH better
I’d do anything to have my teeth like yours even just whitened and I’d be happy. After years of braces as a teenager it’s left me with stained teeth I’m so self conscious about them never smile with my teeth or show them always have my hand in front my mouth. It’s my dream to do them one day I’ll save enough to do it but right now my kiddies are priority love the new you molly love your videos x
Your real teeth are SO MUCH NICER!!!!! Wish I had your teeth 😂😘😘
she looks so gorgeous. absolutely unreal
I think you look so frikin cute. Love the natural vibe
Plz tag or link ur earrings xoxo
Literally whenever I am down, I’ll watch one of her videos and they ALWAYS make me feel better, thank you Molly 😢❤️
Love the natural Molly! It’s so great to see this and to show younger girls that natural is beautiful 🤩
A true influencer😍♥️
Your teeth looked fake before ... your natural teeth are lovely and suit you, they are NOT yellow x
Anyone else thinks she sounds a little different without the teeth things
Eye creams are just glorified moisturizers anyway!! They are just marketed specifically for the eyes even though ingredients are usually similar to moisturizers from the same line, meaning they can up the price/sell two separate products to make more money
You're so lucky Why on earth did you have that procedure done 2 years ago? At your age you are the most beautiful and naturally there is NO need to CHANGE your Face, Lips or Teeth. Everything about you are Perfect apart from you need to learn to talk slower. Calm down we love you ❤️❤️❤️
We need a workout and diet video sis xx
Loving the fact she is going back to her natural self n loving a natural self n that's so beautiful to see
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻I love this journey she’s on I think it’s important for young girls to look up to someone like molly.. nothing will ever beat ur natural beauty !
My armpits are as hairy as a Beethoven dog 🤣🤣
Am SO happy that you are going back to more natural look, am going through the same phase (am gemini as well!!!) AND you are looking wayyyyy more unique and beautiful now! ❤️
I love how your going back to your natural self. You look absolutely gorgeous and sending such a positive message to us girls 💗💗💗
They look the bestttt🥰🥰🥰
You are so naturally beautiful! 😍so happy to see you comfortable in your own natural skin!❤️
You always look good, but your natural teeth looked so much better😍
Wow your teeth are perfect Natural babe!!!! Wish mine was as nice 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ your a natural beauty girl. Flawlesss xxxxxxx
Omg ure natural teeth are gorgeous xxx
Just me and my 18 month old sitting in childrens A&E watching Molly Mae 💁🏻‍♀️🤍❤️
there really isn’t much difference. natural is the way to go though, she looks so fresh!
Literally anything coconut I buy too! You’re my literal fav!
I love that you’re going back to natural but looking after yourself and every area of yourself ❤️
Without Molly this lockdown we’d honestly be lost without here, she always knows how to put a smile on our faces
I love when Molly does her “American” accent😂💜
you look so much prettier with your real teeth! I always questioned "what is wrong with her?" when you was on love island but honestly I don't think those teeth suited your face... youre so naturally gorgeous and I hate how the media manipulates younger people to change when they are perfect the way they are.... I'm sorry to say I was drawn to you through your personality but sometimes put off by the fakeness of appearance... I really love the changes your making, you're so much more authentic and real (you've always been likeable)
Honey your teeth are in perfect condition😂
Your teeth look better! Love your natural journey xxx
WHAT THE HECK YOU HAVE THE NICEST NATURAL TEETH IVE EVER SEEN. 🤯🤯
Your naturally teeth are beautiful and you have a gorgeous smile! Don't be embarrassed at all!
Anyone else use to how fast she talks ? I feel like a genius understanding her speak
Anyone whitening with your dental trays, brush with sensodyne and you won’t get the zingers and pain.
They're gorgeous!
I loveee the natural teeth
Your natural teeth are beautiful!
OMG GORGEOUS!! You look so amazing! Like your natural ones so much better! Stunning. Love from Puerto Rico!
There perfect Molly, good for you, your natural beautiful anyway, enjoying the videos and I like it how your just you, good one you xxx
Your natural teeth are amazing!
Adore your vlogs, amazing as usual❤️
you look amazing 🥰
So annoying like girl-
You are just an absolute boss lady! you look incredible before & after  💛
I adore her ❤️❤️
Absolutely beautiful inside and out💞
Sounds like you’re using hydrogen peroxide? I’d suggest asking your dentist for the 10% carbomide peroxide (the one you sleep in). It means you have to wear it overnight for 7-8 hours instead of 1 hour, but it’s much much less sensitive. Hope this helps! Your teeth look great, much more natural even with the 2nd composites! X
You are naturally beautiful & I think you look incredible without your bonds and the lip fillers.. 💋 my 9yr old daughter watches your get ready" videos and she loves you. You are in my eyes the perfect role model for her and you have a lovely personality ✨💖 keep doing you ✌🤩
I've been thinking of getting my teeth done for so long, but this has convinced me not to... The natural teeth look so much better??
Your teeth are actually perfect! So much more natural looking. Gorgeous!
your teeth are AMAZING Molly xxxxxxx
they’re gorgeous
Wait u don't have WiFi at home girl your well off how u not got WiFi haha
Love your teeth!! And no they don't look yellow, maybe just natural but your previous were very very white so maybe that's why you feel like that? It's okay if you want to whiten them of course, whatever makes you the most confident!
I wish more celebrities would Strip back their over the top look
I bloody love you, what a queen 💛
I am overjoyed to finally see someone going back to their natural looks. The internet is full of "reality star' girls that have totally changed their appearances with fake tans, fake teeth, fake hair, fake eyelashes, ridiculous looking lip injections and even body modifications. they are all starting to look like the same fake girl! Even some of the guys with the overly white fake teeth....lord, its just nutz.
You're teeth look much nicer naturally,  but you think there yellow?? No hun there fine, but maybe cause you're so use to seeing them pure white it's a change for you!!
Sensodine will help with the sensitivity X
I don’t understand why you got work done on your teeth in the first place, you literally have perfect straight teeth. It‘s so sad that you felt the need to change all these things about you because of society 😐
Molly your amazing x
Wow I’m literally about to get composites on 6 of my teeth and nowwwww I am reconsidering.
Where is that amazing dressing gown from please??x
Those tags on your bag. Pull them towards you rather than apart. There’s a little plug that holds them in place 😊 hope that helps x
Refreshing AF to see you get your natural teeth back Molly. They look really good!!!! You are sending a very important message here that health is more important over vanity. 🙏🏼xxx
natural beauty😍❤️
I have so much respect for you for how open and honest you have been on your journey to wanting to become more natural. You look gorgeous, and are an amazing example to young adults out there.   Also you look SO HAPPY! X
So I never comment on YouTube, but aww god bless you. You are so adorable picking out “imperfections” which only make you look more stunning. But I can’t thank you enough for the huge step your taking❤️❤️❤️❤️, it’s gonna help young girls feel good in their normal skin since growing up in this era is all about turning urself into a plastic perfect doll. So THANK YA!
Your natural teeth are so much nicer 💗
You look even more stunning with your natural teeth, such a great influence
Nellaaaaaa

Sorry and I can’t get over Tommy’s laugh at the beginning 😂😂😂😂
Wow the best xxxxxx
Sorry but was I the only one who got really excited when she said another vid will be out soon😭❤️ LOVE IT
They look amazing
people need to stop getting onto everything she says or does like leave her alone
They aren’t yellow 😫
Tommy literally must smile and nod while she chats shite on and on. Tommy needs a girl who doesn't have so much anxiety she is not a great vibe. The fast talking is such a cocaine vibe.
Naturally, they are amazing! And they don't look yellow, and if anything bleaching is such an easy fix! You're so young so keep your natural teeth for as long as possible!
molly they’re beautiful
You look so pretty and in a good way a little more your age! Beautiful 🖤
If molly’s teeth are extremely yellow, then mine are black! Your teeth look amazing! Xx
Tommy’s laugh wtaafff😂😂😂😂😂

So naturally stunning Molly Mae 😚
She looks so good stripped back!!
Loveeee her vids. :) But c'mon girl, why say your teeth are yellow/ aren't white when they clearly are very white? Talk about shaming the rest of us lol.
Your smile is beautiful, for real 💗
Best product for teeth whitening?
You look unbelievable with your natural teeth wow 😍😍
Me: bored   Notifications: Molly Mae had uploaded a new YouTube video Me: Finally yayyyy Queen ❤️
They arnt even yellow babe. Well done to you thou for everything you've reversed. You look so beautiful😍😊
Yellow??? 🤣 really??
Molly, try crests white strips for sensitive teeth ☺️ It’s amazing and so effective
Omg they are really  beautiful
Molly Mae is literally the female influencer all the young girls need! Proving that beauty is being natural. ❤️💕
Your teeth aren't yellow they just look a natural colour. Its probably comparing to the perfect artificial white but I feel most people's teeth look a similar shade to that in real life/without enhancement.
Yes u don’t need them xx I love avocado 🥑 girl
Led light masks are supposed to be good,  u can get ones that are silicone so soft and bendy and u only need to do 10-20 mins few times a week
Molly you honestly are tiny!!! You literally have lost so much weight not that u needed to in the first place. But wow 😦😦😦Ur teeth look unreal too
You look so much better without filler and composite bonds - you are a natural beauty 💕 x
P.s.as a dentist myself please please never do veneers or crowns unless It is a major problem which cant be solved otherwise ❤️
amazing!! so proud of u for making these decisions for urself and living such a kind life
Molly!😍 You are absolutely stunning. Such an inspiration.. love the journey you’re on with yourself. Good for you❤️
‘When I kiss Tommy’s lips I can hydrate his’😂 we love it😂😂
Beautiful as always❤️
Molly I know you get a lot of unnecessary hate and you don’t deserve it at all but I think when you post a picture of one spot and act like it’s the end of the world, it’s insensitive to people (like myself) who would do anything for your “bad skin” because to us, it’s good skin🤍 Like I say though you don’t deserve hate but at least understand where people are coming from
You look gorgeous
GORGEOUS SMILE😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
molly it’s so funny when you talk in an american accent 😂😂
OMG UR U SAYING UR TEETH ARE YELLOW OMG there so white!!!!😍😍😍😩😩😩😩
MOLLY!! THEY LOOK SO GOOD!!
I know because she’s a celebrity she is hard on herself about how she looks but her natural teeth and literally gorgeous🤩🤩
you look so much more youthful with your natural teeth! they’re gorgeous 😍
I loveee your teeth, you’re beautiful inside and out! 💕💕❤️
Your natural teeth are perfect. 😍😍
Your natural look is so much more beautiful ❤️
Love you molly u slay❤️
You should totally go with short hair more often, you look so good! 😍
That pink balenciaga hoodie looks gorgeous!😍
“Say hello chickens” 😂
Your natural teeth are so lovely and match your personality xx
You’re teeth are amazing and they are not yellow, what are you on about?!
Your teeth colour is fine? I think your bonding was unrealistically white so your teeth you just need to get used to them again. They’re a healthy and fine colour.
Molly you look AMAZING!! I really appreciate your honesty and how real you are. You are an incredible role model and I’m very grateful for that. Team Molly all the way! Xxx
Such an inspiration 💗💗💗💗
Save the water!
They are so beautiful and natural, you look amazing x
Your natural teeth look great . Good for you x
I love that she’s realising she was gorgeous to begin with, hopefully younger girls will see this and realise that they don’t need fillers and veneers as soon as they turn 18
Your natural teeth look SOOOOO beautiful!!!! love them!!!! xxxxxx
Molly couldn’t be any more beautiful if she tried to ❤️☺️
does anyone know where the dressing gown is from ??? :(
Your teeth look lovely, white teeth aren't healthy teeth, especially when they look uv white x x x x
She doesn't deserve all the hate she gets she is amazing also I actually love Tommy's  laugh 😂
Omg Molly your natural teeth look amaizinggggg. You look so beautiful xxx
They look stunning 🤩 🥺
Love
Social media has a lot of influence on people and what they feel they need to do with their body. But I love how you are embracing your natural body again and documenting it. Really appreciate it x
They aren’t even yellow babe! It’s only because you’re used to the shiny white x
Dude her teeth are so nice what is she talking about???? I’d love to have her teeth :O
invisalign on your top jaw will widen your smile so much. do it!
Beautiful girl 😊
Colgate pro-relief applied like a cream on your sensitive teeth can help so much especially when whitening them✨
Molly Mae always keeping it real! ❤️
Looking fab love the teeth 😍😍

I love your energy......
Couldn’t even tell the difference

Is it just me or does her voice/accent sound different after the change?
Your teeth are great! Love!
Your natural teeth are literally how I want my teeth to look what.

I love your real teeth, they're so cute
Your teeth look great! Also, did you paint your own nails or are they fake? If so, where did you get them they’re gorgeous xx

I found out last month that my two front teeth are composite veneers, that got put on my teeth when I was in year 6...I am nearly at the end of my second year at uni :/ I am due to get it removed and replaced in the summer, so it is safe to say I am pooing myself. I might actually look like that witch, HAHA! Pray for me! p.s. you look amazing Molly!!!!
Love watching ur vids love ya molly xxx
Omg just got to end of the vlog and I’m actually howling at her talking about her Apple Watch😂😂 ‘even though it makes me look like Ben 10 or a ninja turtle like it’s like a device’ I’m honestly dead🤣😂🤣💀💀

Molly you look stunning, so glad you are doing this , all girls now a days all look the same , with the filler and teeth, it’s like instergram   clones , I can’t even tell how old they are , you looks such a natural beauty, I’m 54 back in my day,  there was no fillers Botox , and some had  had thin lips 👄 and mostly they looked stunning every one looked different , I’m sure this is the way it will go back too and it’s nice to see you doing this , saying it ok to be you , be proud to be you and show your beautiful self , under all that fakeness x look at the old Charlie’s angels from the eightys how gorgeous were they
Your the only influencer I love your real and not fake 💗💗💗this is why you’re relatable
Your natural teeth Look so much better,the old ones were so big and didn’t fit your face and I think your teeth are not yellow but are nice!

Natural teeth all the way
Im happy there's a vlog 😩💕
Loved this vid as always. You can wear your Apple Watch in the bath just put it on water mode x
You’re such a cutie! Your natural teeth look just as great as your bonds! ♥️♥️ thanks for sharing
Both beautiful but much prefer natural 🥺🥰
Yes Molly!!!
Your natural teeth are amazing
You are so precious Molly!🥺🥺🥺
You’re so beautiful! I recommend you try coconut pulling for oral health which  also whitens your teeth! My smile was brighter after just a few days.
Love your vlogs! And your teeth look amazing 💗💗
Go on molly😁
I love her energy!!! 😩
Lmao am I the only ex Nu skin seller relieved this girl is telling the world about their weirdness!?!? Like damn. How are they still so big!?
can't believe she keeps saying her teeth are yellow !!!! not even a bad thing if they were
Your natural teeth 🦷 are beautiful and eye cream should be applied last BTW ! xx
Your teeth look so good😍
Your natural teeth are actually amazing !! Your Teeth look so much nicer good on you for feeling comfortable to go naturally especially as your in the public eye and there is so much pressure on you and us girls in general these days! Xxx
Low key attention seeking about “yellow teeth “ I must be colour blind 😂
I really appreciate you “stripping back” ! It’s a really positive thing I think your doing for yourself and anyone that may look up to you! And your old teeth look perfect!
Why is no one saying how much better she looks after she’s gone all natural with her lips and teeth ? She’s literally stunning and has the cutest baby face ever
I love your natural teeth and they are so pearly white!!!! x
Natural is looking goood on you 🥰
They’re gorgeous molly !!
You look amazing, your teeth look amazing !!!! Honestly you are amazing naturally ❤️😍🥰 inside and out 😘
They look so good!!!
the teeth next to your centrals are called the laterals. those laterals shouldn't be the same length as yout centrals, cause that wouldnt look natural, they should be smaller. i am not sure whether your dentist explained you that.  ps: you are awesome :)
they look so great babes. the natural you suits you well 😍
you think your natural teeth are yellow.... then mine are the sun :((( i think im gonna get composite bonds now to hide my teeth xoxo   jk i cant afford it, but your teeth are lovely
This new hair is giving me proper made in Chelsea vibes, so classy love it 🤩
If you are insecure about your teeth whiteness, use a daily whitening mouthwash! You use it in the morning and at night, and can do it on top of white strips <3
YOOOOOO this natural wave for Molly is a GLOW UP 2.0 & I’m here for ittttt!!!!
Who else thinks molly mae is absolutely beautiful 😘❤️
I just love this natural journey your on absolutely beautiful.
✨✨
Same, such a mood always in bed by half-ten even on weekend what life has done to us since the last year happen we're like different people entirely; not even like there is much to get up for in a morning! Great that you decided to upload another week in the life - they're one of my favourite videos so relatable and give us chance to catch up; been well these last few weeks have been a struggle yet we move-forward - that self-reliance! Sending well wishes. Brilliant that you taking step to become more your natural looking self again - you look amazing! X
Such an amazing woman, so positive and just nice.. love that 🙌🏽
Loving the more natural you! Beautiful 💓😘 xx
They look AMAZING!
Does that mean your natural teeth weren't cleaned for two years! Lol Also your natural teeth are fine, like there's people out there with really bad teeth who can't even afford to have them fixed
Your natural teeth are so nice! I would be happy with those teeth 😬
Honestly how do people hate on this girl,she’s so genuine and kind
Molly: “my teeth are so yellow right now” Me: oh if that’s yellow then what are mine
Yellow as the sun? Shiii mine must be orange then lol
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 NATURAL RULES ❤️❤️💪🏼
You look amazing 💞
You look so beautiful with your natural look, makes me feel better about myself too
You look stunning!

The more natural Molly turns, the more better she looks... HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?!
Love them.
‘sorry that was absolutely disgusting why did I say that’ hahahah she is literally so iconic
I LOVE them 😍
Adore the waffle dressing gown!!! Xx
Those teeth are NOT yellow! They're fab! I've had some implants as I still had a few baby teeth (some of my adult teeth just didn't form weirdly! 🙃) But my dentist made them look natural, just adult teeth instead of my tiny milk teeth 🥛🍼 lol x
Your teeth are so nice girl keep them natural
I love sitting down to eat, opening YouTube and seeing that molly uploaded. A great feeling 😄💕
Stunning
I loveeeeeee natural molly 😍😍😍

I love her so much already. I didnt realise I could love her more when she did this
I’m so glad I’m not the only one who has fear of public vlogging 🤣 I thought it may get better as I grow my channel but hearing Molly queen of YouTube who still has fear makes me feel slightly better 🤣❤️ also if you’re reading Molly, you’re beautiful. So glad you’re going back to your natural self for you and helping all the youngsters watching this xxxx
That’s disgusting you haven’t cleaned your teeth for 2 years
Her American accent hahahaha

Anyone else still waiting for a health update? Or have I missed something? I saw she was waiting to hear for a diagnosis? Can’t watch her vlogs without worrying she might be going through a really tough time and we have no idea or can’t support!
molly they are not yellow😭😭 it’s because you’ve gone from extremely fake white to natural teeth, they’re definitely not yellow they’re white!!!
So naturally stunning it’s unreal
You are such a good influence on young girls who look up to you <3 educating on natural beauty and health x
So pretty all you have to do is whiten them but they are so pretty!!they ain’t yellow 🙄....to be honest I don’t understand why they let you put them on so young!!!
I literally feel like Molly is like everyone’s older sister having a good chit chat to us all
when molly maes dentist looks like a 5 star club in ibiza whilst your dentist looks like its been there for thirty years
I love your natural teeth!!
You’re so beautiful 🥺🥺
I love your new teeth and they are not yellow...I think you are so used to see the other one before that comparing looks more yellow but they are gorgeous I am loving you more natural 🥰
Your teeth are lit perf, i think they look 'yellow' to you because you're so used to your 'perfect' white teeth, I wish I had your natural teeth girl!
Actually blows my mind how we are the same age

Molly Mae honesty girl you give me life. highlight of my week haha!
You are such a naturally beautiful little ray of sunshine .... you are so likeable molly and so beautiful
fave influencer❤️
It looks SO much better!! And not yellow at all 👏🏻
not molly saying her teeth are so yellow when they're the FURTHEST thing from being yellow 😭
Such a difference when you are talking afterwards.... aw you are amazing Mollymae...... your natch teeth are NOT YELLOWWWW!!! omg they are so perfect and straight.... god if you saw mine you would be horrified.... x
WHY DO YOU NOT HAVE A CASE ON YOU PHONE OMG!!!
Can’t wait to see more videos 🥺
molly mae youve never looked so beautiful.
eye cream after moisturizer, but really most eye. creams are just intensely hydrating so if you have a hydrating moisturizer cream then its basically the same thing. if you want brightening you just get a brightening moisturizer or bring a serum up to your eye. the only eye creams that actually do anything are ones with caffeine. Some people have an eye cream and a moisturizer because they have oily skin so a heavy cream wouldn't be good for them all over. I don't see you as having oily skin so you probably have everything you need already, just be gentle around the area. LOVE THIS CHANNEL. hi from america
Inspiring young teenagers ❤️❤️
Beautiful 😍😍
Molly, you’re an inspiration! And wow so beautiful xxx
is it just me or do you love her natural teeth! if i had those teeth... i dont even know what i would do but yeah haha
they look great!!
Your teeth are gorgeous and I could not see the differents between before and after
Your teeth literally are not yellow in the slightest bit
Molly is the only influencer in the UK that is actually good at influencing 👏  well done girl x
Molly finally role modelling, props <3
Your teeth look gorgeous 😍
There amazing
Molly Mae you don't realise how much of a natural beauty you are. You would look sensational wearing a binbag.😘 You are promoting natural beauty and  showing people you can be comfortable in your own skin without having to have cosmetic treatments. With your huge platform and influences you will have such a postive response amongst your followers. You are one of the most postive, genuine influencers out there and i absolutely love everything you represent. You deserve every success and happiness.  Lots of Love to you and Tommy❤
Your teeth are beautiful!! Not yellow in the slightest, don’t be embarrassed.
Your natural teeth are absolutely gorgeous!! xxx
When you called your teeth yellow and I see it as the brightest white 😂😭 if her teeth are yellow then mine are dirt
You look absolutely amazing! You do what you want too! Sending lots of love!!!!
They look amazing xx
Really excited for this video🧡
i just love molly, shes so positive, makes my day sm better:)
There’s literally nothing I can fault this girl for. At an age where Altering your image and changing things is a big thing and with her job having so much pressure on her appearance, she’s doing the complete opposite and reversing those changes. The type of girl I’d want my little sister or daughter to watch on social media. BEAUTIFUL, in and out.
A beauty😍
You should watch the BBC Three documentary on MLM's, that's what Lumi Spa/Nu Spa is, the girls selling are under so much pressure to sell as they all get put into debt it's really bad!
Loove your natural teeth 🦷! So much better really 😍
If you stopped driving coke your teeth would be whiter 😬
Such a good influence for young women. Also you look beautiful with your natural lips and teeth
What size does milky wear in joggers love her fit in them!
Gurl where are the yellow teeth I can't see them! Also love these vlogs they make my week!
Molly your real teeth are wonderfully beautiful
GOOD GIRL  MOLLY..  SO GLAD TO SEE YOU EMBRACE YOUR NATURAL BEAUTY...perhaps  this will  inspire alot of people to accept basic self love xxx
You’re teeth look amazing babe 😍
Just SOOOO beautiful!
You look so much younger and more youthful with your natural teeth!
I love Molly so much ❤
They look SO GOOD!!
if your teeth are extremely yellow molly, i don't even want to know what mine are
Your teeth look soooo much better!  Makes you look younger some how
omg i am CACKLING at tommy at the start of the vid 😭😭😭
I love her natural teeth. Their so straight and look so much more natural xx
Molly please buy a new pan :D
Molly! Your teeth look great, to be honest it’s very hard to really see a huge difference between before you got your teeth done and after. I think when it’s yourself, you focus more on it than anyone else ever would. So happy for you!!
Hi lovely I have quite yellow teeth I don't smoke either but I would love to have my teeth whitened but my 3 front teeth are crowns so it will be expensive and a long process. But your teeth look OK they don't look disgusting but they are in lovely condition I bet they will look lovely when finished. You are funny abd make me smile love your vlogs xx
I’m sorry, but how beautiful is Molly Mae!!! The short hair at the end... oh my jeez!
Molly is the best🥰😩
Your natural teeth are beautiful! omg, so straight! 🤍 100% agree about MLM companies (NuSkin) they are suuuuper intense 😅😅😅
now molly needs to go natural with her hair. we have never seen her natural hair
Why’d I think she was 25 😭😂she is so mature
When is the video with Fran coming?
You look 1000000% better. Don’t change
What an amazing role model it’s so refreshing to see someone in the public light going more natural!! It makes me feel so much more confident in my own skin to see this and Molly looks absolutely stunning natural!
I really cant see the yellow?? your natural teeth are amazing! I'm sat here in braces at 37, my teeth are social distancing lol, only 3 months in 😂, fab vlog ben 10😂😂
Love the natural you, so beautiful and such a good influence for all women ❤️
Can you please do an update on your skin cancer? Nobody knows if you have cancer or not and a lot of people are worried.
who else wishes she would leave all of the funny clips of tommy in (like bad words and all)
Molly they look really good I can’t see how you think they look yellow they just white and normal teeth   Loved the vlog :)
Mollymae: singing  Tommy: HeLLo and GOODbyE  Mollymae: say Hello my chickens  😂😂 Like this if you love Tommy and molly  Like this if they make your quarantine better  “You want like this comment”
could you do a video on your diet??
I absolutely love that you are going on more of an all natural route, and promoting that! You’re letting us young girls know that it’s OK to be natural and embrace our natural beauty! So empowering!!
I wish her vlogs would never end 😢
Molly is literally the nicest person ever and her videos are so entertaining ❤💕💖
I love your natural teeth!
I hate to discuss your looks, and I don't know how, but your cheek bones look higher once you got your bonds removed. I love it! 💕💕💕 Sending you the best
Your teeth look lovely!! Wayy better
“My teeth are as yellow as the sun and I hate them”  Me with much yellower teeth that are literally just my natural teeth colour: ☹️
A natural queen 💜💜💜💜
Love that you are embracing your natural self!! You are beautiful either way but it is refreshing to see 💖

I've gotta say I love the fact you've grown so much and learning to love your more natural self. So much respect ❤️
That’s a good question! Is it eye cream first or moisturizer?
i love molly's energy just so much 😫✨❤️
I love the more natural teeth look, you can always whiten them if you think you need them.
Your natural teeth look so much better.
your teeth are so far from yellow!!!
I love you for getting back to your natural beautiful self! It suits you so much better.
wicked which of of the EAST. lmao. it's WEST but I think it was adorable nonetheless
Welcome to the anti-MLM side of life 🤣 those aggressive people are called “huns”

I admire this girl so much!!!
molly is so beautiful! she’s just proving that you don’t need filler or anything to look beautiful. good influencer!!
your teeth look so good!
You are gorgeous! Good for you for this journey. This needs to happen more!
Girl your natural teeth are absolutely gorgeous!!!
Love the natural omg
Your natural teeth shape is actually perfect and they are so straight!!
Omg can’t deal 😬😭
You look beautiful with your natural teeth!!
your teeth look so much better now this way! thanks for always being so real and genuine in front of the camera, not many people can do that these days!! Love from the US!
Love your teeth Molly 😍 I'm so glad your going back to natural you are naturally stunning ! So many people make themselves look so much worse with too much work it's such a shame, your a great role model for young girls 💗👏
your natural teeth are perfecttt!
Molly Mae doesn’t realise that she is the biggest inspiration in most people’s life’s🥺I love you so much Molly Mae💖keep being you and achieving everything in life✨I love you queen 👸🏼
her natural teeth are like perfect anyways!
Aw you look so happy! And your such a good influence to young girls honestly, keep being you x
How are they yellow wtf so dramatic ahaha they’re white
Her teeth look so much better natural omg, she’s so pretty x
I think that because your bonding was soooo unnaturally white, you now think your normal teeth are yellow haha. Because they are actually a nice healthy normal white!! Definitely not yellow at all. But Overall, you look amazing and you’re setting such a great example for people our age. We’re only in our early 20s, getting work done isn’t necessary! You look great
What do you have on your nails please? 😍😍
It's actually so lovely that she feels happy to go back to natural. Showing that she's still her, treatment or not.
Her teeth are so nice!!
Your natural teeth are so frickin cute!!!!
Your smile is beautiful
Beautiful beautiful girl ❤️
Respect to you for stepping away from the norm and using your platform to encourage girls to be more natural and sensible about getting cosmetic procedures 🙏🏼 you look so much better and it’s really encouraging me to step away from filler etc, as we all know how much pressure there is from social media to look perfect xxxx
Love this journey to being more natural!
Your natural teeth are amazing!
I love your new look🥰🥰  your such an inspiration🥰 I wore braces for 4 years and still have a love/hate relationship with my teeth but this helped a lot🥺😍
They look so much better natural. Gorgeous
The most genuine angel, you look gorgeous x

So important to show this side of things and i love that you realize that its not all about fillers and stuff. You look amazing and your teeth ar definetly not as yellow as you feel, they look very good! Hope young girls will think twice before they have work done =) This shows so much growth in you

She doesn’t realise she makes our lockdown 1000x better when she uploads 🙄

Molly looks beautiful with and without the filler but it’s amazing to see her reversing the effects despite the pressure of the world at the moment in regards to filler and how we look! Thank you Molly for being you. So real and genuine x
I do like that you are teaching youngsters you don't need fillers and fake teeth ..I admire that 🙌💖
It’s crazy that we’re the same age?!
Molly you allllways make my days better with your videos. I appreciate you and your energy 😍😍✨
Your natural teeth are amazing!!!!
She's 21.. I am 22 yikes how our lives are so different
Instead of using a scrub you should use a chemical peel there not as harsh xx
Whyyyyy are you saying they are yellow or soooo different when I cant see a change 🤷‍♀️
Wow they’re so much better 😍 didn’t ever need them to start with 😍
i love how molly is now making herself more natural and i’m all here for it (obviously there’s nothing wrong with having cosmetic surgery, you do you but i love how she’s real with us)
Where did you get the composite bonding done? X
Molly I’m not kidding you’ve genuinely made my quarantine better, you lift our spirits 🤧❤️, I think it’s the bubbly personality that does it
I love how positive her videos are like even how she doesn’t put swear words in it
You're absolutely just the sweetest! And you look so much younger now
Love all your video molly !!!! 🤍
Tommy literally makes the videos 10 times funnier. It killssss meee.
You have amazing teeth!!!!!
😍😍😍😍
"HELLO AND GOODBYE " 🤣
❤️❤️
They are not yellow 😂😂
Okay can we appreciate how brave molly is. She gets scrutinised on everything about her appearance and still has courage! MOLLY YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL NATURAL OR NOT
Her dentist looks like a flipping 5 star hotel😭😭😭😂😂 jesus christ if her teeth aren't white then mine must be rotten 😑
She looks so beautiful 🥺 I hope girls can take this as a lesson, you don’t need fillers to feel pretty! Embrace your natural self. You are all beautiful❤️
4:15 idk why but it sounds like the radio people that speak in the radio lol
Lovely video molly mae xx
Natural beauty, YESSS😍😍😍 WE LOVE IT
gorgeous as always molly 🤍 love your natural teeth!
YESSSS!!YOU. ARE. INSPIRING. WOMEN. ALL. AROUND. THIS IS WHAT BEING AN “influencer” IS ALL ABOUT. YOU. ARE. INFLUENCING!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
She looks so much better without the fuller and composit bonds she looks like a model so stunning   Edit: omg thanks for all the likes and molly thank you for liking your the biggest inspiration, I’m so happy your feeling comfortable will your old self enough to go back to being beautifully natural, wishing you all the best pretty🤍🤍
You look like you lost a lot of weight on your face 😳💕
Tommy’s laugh though! 🤣
Molly, your natural teeth are so gorgeous. You made the right decision :)
Your natural teeth are lovely xx
I’m confused composite bonds don’t go OVER your teeth they get added onto the sides to make them longer/wider etc..does she mean composite veneers? They’re the ones that go over the teeth
Your teeth look so incredible after removing the bonds. So much respect for you for stripping yourself back. It's so refreshing especially as you're a role model to young girls xx
your teeth r so pretty omg
Molly: My teeth are so yellow ME: What .. what ??  I legit have not noticed her teeth being yellow ... It looked so white and good to me.
Do you still use the Charlotte tilbury cream you used in your last skincare video
i hope whoever reads this gets clear skin x
teeth are the same tho does she not see
I think your natural teeth are beautiful xxx
The natural smile looks so amazing! You look soooo classy
When she says her teeth aren’t white.... Um 😟 mine must be brown then
The hello chickens was really cute!😂
