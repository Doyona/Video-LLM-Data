Thank God I didn’t grow up in this error. The women act like they’re men I feel sorry for young guys. Gotta deal with these type of women these days. Goddamn that’s terrible
Saweetie is literally the queen of nail designs! She has a different nail color and design with every look she does. This woman must be getting her nails done every other day. Nothing wrong with that though. Just another perk that comes with being a rich celeb. I love nails. I've worn acrylic nails myself since I was like 15. I can't ever take them off, and I will never take them off.
Esta canción me gustó mucho, saludos desde Perú 🇵🇪♥️
the nails are so long
TELL EM
I miss 2020 I miss our home

When this song came out, it was such a good time!😫😫
I saw her described as a “rap sensation” the other day, but this is just completely forgettable pop music. What happened to hip hop? It used to be awesome…on the cutting edge culturally and musically. Not any more, unfortunately.
Just dumped this toxic ex cuz she still feeling her bd. It’s all cool cuz I got me
This literally her best song ever
Saweetie got her one with this joint, this song is a certified timeless classic.🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆

I have decided to just play this song on repeat with my current boyfriend /so often he eventually feels some type of way and asks me to leave / "just go back to the streets then, damn".  💀💀💀🕉️💦
I tried not to feel Like this song Didn't HIT ME AS HARD AS IT EVER COULD WITH EVERY LINE  cuz I felt guilty  Singing it while dating someone I was trying to never leave  But after I left everyone who ever abused me or neglected me,  This song   Makes me dance against my will And hits me so hard I feel like crying in the purest joy  Every line hits me like a flashback that makes me scream  F_______FFF YES I CONCUR I AGREE I APPROVE  sorry for yelling in all caps cuz 💕💕💕💕❣️❣️❣️❣️💥💥💥💥🤯
🧖‍♀️🧖🧝‍♀️👋
I mean would you be mad if Jhené dumped you but then passed you to Saweetie?
😍🤩🤩🤩
Happy Wednesday gangster
My favorite Saweetie song
This song takes me back to 2013/14 when Mustard ruled the music sound with this type beats.  The only thing missing is the iconic  "hey, hey, hey, hey" 😂❤️
me when i step outside my house.
She always wear the most beautifull clothing and heels
That rhinnestones underwear is Beautifull🙀😻🐺auuu💗💫! Where is from ?

I miss elysa. Xowhy I didn't do zhit to take you from me I fucken hate youxo. That was the first awake kall from heaven xo.
I hate i just found out about this song.
You talking about Ex acting like he own you and the way covered in different colours like a clown with that thick layer of paint or cosmetic powder covering your face and moving that stinky ass of yours girl your acting like your shit don’t smell. There no talent whatsoever the only thing I saw was that you acting like your shit don’t stink, when you flew into the clouds with the bike I burst out laughing you wanted to act like an angel, but wtf are you saying have you thought about that, there’s no fucking talent at all seriously it gave me a headache just fucking watching you seriously you need to learn haw to act and bring some realism into your life and and see the wisdom kicking into your pathetic mentality.
Yeah I’m back from the streets
I'm hot but I hot get ask for heir and I will get back to geek out for bally years later turf if we want a g I'd that we get ask w to get ask feet for a dog copay and I XPath

I mean seriously, when I am alone rapping it, you cant tell me I am not in the video in a twerk contest with YOU!!!!

Tão perfeita❤
Jesus is the way, the truth and the life.
Anti-semetism, cause why are all these people showing off? from the hishchool...
I keep trying to find out why I'm out for drawings must a been a different day. I only remember cause other a.d. Conway ain't never been to that park and that's why I ride my bike to that park but I'm out fa drawings cause door don't get slammed on me na, I was welcomed because same reason of other a.d. Conway ain't never been there I was young though like 13 years old I remember that and the magazine had the thong that read sosa instead of back to the streets probably explains the chief keef song if people think and remember. I wonder if people notice that they called the guy that used to get door slammed on him at that house the police by the shirt he's wearing on the video.  Mass songs is like remixes of local with new voices to me.  I remembered the first time I heard" back to the streets" from the terminator since I got up like the new terminator in daycare and I changed the meaning then I guess this makes back 2 the streets off road again from the guy in the hame 12 shirt in the video and then was chilling back 2 the streets from my momma's.  Honestly I started even hearing the name chief keef different like a lisp or something I mean obviously I'm April fools I even heard me drinking rose in one the songs so the sosa gotta be the metal thongs chief keef be back 2 the streets too since 4 streets from my momma's I mean since remixed new voice from local I think the joke was them metal thongs look like they stank in the magazine cause how can be cleaned is how I was when I was young but they look good on saweetie... I remember "used to be a used to "being  "used to be a loose screw "now too but once again new voices ain't that like that scene in "wanted" joke?  questions um Uno darts skipbo trivia and cards is the games played as a youngin and skipbo was like the worst  setting the deck cause I got beat like in two minutes but I promised my children no recess so I aint playing right now just working till my children come home nothing personal.
Saweetie is coming for blood
❤🐛

I think this is one of her best songs.
Her best snog! I love it💖💖💖
Shes a 5/10 at best , we all know woman cant produce for sheit
I wish Saweetie made more music like this ❤
Where the heck people that comment the lyrics when I need them?????
Girls really be listening to these lyrics. Smh. Women like this give a LOT of good black women a horrible public image. Its an absolute shame that young girls actually listen to this garbage.

Genius idea to put timestamps in a music video

i kicked my abusive husband to the curb and tossed him back to the streets and got a new man who way better n upgraded my life this song inspired me to put 2 warrants on him <3
bad fishy fishy blub blub :C
Bitch this song is bussin
I means she’s from sac… what do you expect ?
She should have kept this style.  Sharp with her words.  Its like her earlier music she used to end her words sharply and quick.  Cant explain but it was it
Love y'all real gangster trillonaire businessmen and business women realness. 87 peachez

K.D ARGENTINA
definitely the black version of "thank u,next"
Where is the rapping then? Its talk singing hehehe
What? This is the first song she didn't use somebody's beat
Saweetie in just got the meal
I'm not usually a fan of this type of music or this type of lifestyle, but I must admit that I went into this with the intent to really listen to the song and I did. This was a very good song. I'm glad I gave it a chance.
hi Saweetie, it's me Violet.
This and beat friend are my favorite
I Love this song it's Really groovy.🎼🎤🔊🎶🎷
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love this song😻💖🇧🇷
Saweetie must feature Saucy Santana
This one so catchy damn!!!
Ay as a male i feel i can speak for half of us boys that this song is actually gas
Waou
BA to the FUK
sweetie ftw
What class and ABC if you don’t hear me city Superscape be seeing me last visit to commission of the
😍
But i front of millions watching you
For the streets instead a bit rude to females? Understood she’s for the streets
this is SO underrated
“I’m saweetie and this is my McDonald’s order”
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🌟
People listening to this after quarantine: 💃💃💃
This song is hot garbajay.
Love the beat. Chill vibez
Why doesn't this have more views
I can say this my fav song so far.. still looking thru her stuff.. Just finding out about her with the McDonalds meal.. She is pretty..
🔥🔥🔥🔥
this would’ve blew up if she dropped this after her and quavo broke up
As seen in December 2020 on Kiss 97.3 KKSS-FM
FUKT UP AMAZING
I really love it sweetie I really didn’t listen to her but I love all her shit she is so pretty I love all her outfit in her videos
The add I got when I clicked this video is a add of saweetie getting McDonalds-
Bumping this while eating my Saweetie meal.
I wish Cardi B would take her advice on this!!!
I had a chick like her once, she ended up being the #2 most beautiful in her constituency...
Is she riding a bike in heels??
Apenas descubro esta canción 🤧
Saweetie ❤❤❤
💖 she so beautiful she should make a song with nicki
Brasil 🇧🇷 aqui 😍😉
I can't be the only person that when she hears la de da da it sounds like my papi daddy died 💀
Jhene aiko is so pretty
whos here after saweetie sent quavo back to the streets
girlll
I can listen to Jhenes part over and over all day and night. Anything that girl touches is 🔥
This is really a nice song …chilled 💖☺️👑
Confidence is dangerous👏👏👏
Let’s talk about how sweetie bodied every style in this video 😍
bro i got a ad for the saweetie meal lol
This my first time seeing this video is that the lightskin girl from the hate you give in the beginning she look just like her...
This is one of favorite saweetie song
I love this beat so much. I don’t know if they call it synth…but I love it & Saweetie did her damn thing on this song!! My fav one from her
i put this on to smoke to and ended up watching the whole video instead
This is kinda trash
Jhene on the post chorus was amazing
Quay be like : i’m gay now.
I heard saweetie first time singing
Finally leaving my baby daddy FOR GOOD
I love this vibe type of singing from saweetie she rocks it 😍🤍🤍
Imma Saweetie fan but Jhene made this song sound better!
The whole video is a vibe🙏
I just love her songs jealous down
Seems like every celeb be getting collage now lol
There’s ads are on point 🎯
What a shame that trash like this  is famous. The internet and YT are responsible for this. If they had to rely on talent instead of YT they would be working at McDonald’s
Trash music
Risky was trash but this one kina hit tho, quavo was still in the right tho even tho this song slaps
This music sucks and is horrible this is what  everyone call rap in 2021 its pathetic what happen to real rap nowadays its either mumble rap autotune or popstar rap... This right here sounds like if Katy perry  or Brittany spears changed  genres and went from pop to rap.... Bring back real rap music not this nonsense
I just received my first ever lapdance to this song after being nice to this (admittedly cute) chick and gave her and her friend a ride home after they discovered they had 2 flats at the bar. I'd say it was a good night.
So cute
Digging this colab!
I heard this from an old guy jogging with his mini speakers. The beat is quite catchy. Good thing i opened my Shazam before he jogged away.
Not me getting a sweetie McDonald's ad before this 😂
No shade but that short hair look is noooot it.
This shit hit different after going through a long term relationship breakup .

This song hit different now that I sent mine back to the streets
This song is a whole vibe ✌🏻
I like how she does not curse a lot in her songs bad words like the other celebs "Best dress" *Ayeeee* 😌
"Guuurl whatchu know about the streets?" That part seemed so genuine
YAS girl
My Baby 🥰😘💙
Saweetie a pretty black goddess

quavo actually just repo'd the Bentley from her and sent Streetie back to the streets damn that's cold❄️
It hits differently when you just broke up with someone, And you still wanna be a Baddie 😭😭
So good
Blasian Gang!!
Miss Aiko👑 ain't no joke. She is The most hood rap artist out there, yet she is so classy. I can't stand when people talk shit. But when Miss Aiko be shit talking, it sounds classy. She's in the category of Mr. Chris Brown, they are both extremely talented, they both be putting out hit after hit, after hit, after hit🏆🎵🎶but don't get the respect and the recognition from the media that they deserve. Because (The media is owned and ran by W's, Europeans and Jews) anyways. Love you Miss Aiko keep up the good work girlfriend 🎶🎵👌❤🙏🏽
omg jhene is so pretty
Lol
7w
Black and yellow black end yellow.
i constantly smile to this music video. shes so gorgeous <3 literally body goals, i love her sm
😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😍😍😍😍😍😍
I love the E.T. VIBES
We did some research on this rapper. 27 years old and we listen to some of her videos. We understand that there are a lot of people that like her because she has collaborated with well-known artists. We guess if we take off all the weaves, the heavywigs, all the makeup, the long fake fingernails, you probably see a young looking girl. The problem we have with this rapper like a lot of other rappers is using the n e g g a word like it's a toy to play with. We just finished looking at a documentary the other day on the enslaved of black people so many years ago. How a slave had to walk around with her mistress from sun up to some down sometimes 2:00 in the morning dedicating to her. We look at these videos of these young rappers and we say to ourselves all the hard work was done for these people now they're using the negga word like it's nothing. Don't have enough room here to say what we really want to say but how soon these young rappers forget if they even been taught how hard blacks really had to go through just not to be lynched . You can watch the video of enslaved blacks and what the women had to go through on YouTube called  Caroline Branham enslaved woman .

That hair is not it .. it’s not giving what it’s supposed to give
Get out of satan system and get in God system before its to late people claim they love God and want to heaven but lifestyle heart mind mouth lyrics and soul says satan and hell check out Stephen Darby Negroland on YouTube this is your wake up call ⏳
...when you give a “fugly” person a chance and they start acting like you’re the “fugly” one. The Audacity
Listen to the message in the music and hold artist accountable.

I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. (Luke 13:5) Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me. Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest. (Psalms 51:1-4)

Saweetie need all that make up just to look average 💀
Catchy song, hot girls. But these lyrics are just chick porn. Any guy with the game to bang Sweetie or Jhene is not one to settle down. Back to the streets is precisely where he wants to go. As for passing him off to your hot friend, if that's supposed to be a punishment it's the dumbest lyric in the history of music.
bxh
This that elevator floor swag
This is a JAM.
⭐️⭐️⭐️
Love the fact she supports samsung   no iphone hate iphone
*Quavo has left the chat*
Girl sent him to the streets 🤣
Love how it’s ironic 🥰
Does this song contain the sample of “too short - I’m a player” ?
Back to the elevator
Who knew that afro Americans would be the death of rnb and hip hip
Swatiee proved that once you hurt a cancer ♋️ woman there is no getting her back 😂😂😂😂
Way more talented than Migos. Make your paper and move on girl !
It pisses me off when Jhene says she can't do a song with her sister because they don't have the same kind of style while she'll do songs with every other musician that has a different style than her and it sounds good because you need that on a song to make it sound unique. She needs to do a song with her sister Mila J!!
When this song first came on the radio I immediately tried to find who it came from because I love it😎  Also this is my most favorite song from Saweetie
"girl, what you know about the streets? 🤨"
This sounds like a big Sean track lol I bet they share same producers..
I remember when i found this song when high and it was amazing I couldn't stop listening to it
Saweetie been send Guava back to the streets she was just forewarning us 🤣😂 and yes I said guava instead of quavo .
Praying for both of them both!!!
The aesthetics of this clip are unbelievable y’all
I (Tia) NEEDED this song 🎶 so BAD TODAY!!! 03•31•21💕🙏🏿🥰👯‍♀️🤑

He made her
I really vibe with this song
COME to Jesus you people are making a big mistake and you can still fix this remember my words and consider this a warning once you are in heaven you shouldn't tell God you didn't know because I'm telling you now!
The signs were everywhere foo played himself
I feel bad for saweetie we don’t no what she was going through of camera with quavo..and yes I’m a saweetie fan if she was in the wrong I would say that I’m not afraid y’all quavo fans swear that nigga innocent and for those who are like I’m not picking sides until I no the truth are sad because .. the video shows some sides of him that I ain’t like.. now what if he didn’t see that camera.. I also needed audio so I can no exactly what happen .. they need to release audio.. she was mentally and physically abused in my opinion
Eeeeeeeee
considered yourself blessed lol yep send them back to the streets like it
The lyrics are now understandable lol after the elevator 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
I dedicated this song to a girl and she thought song was weird so I blocked her. 😊😊😊 Back to da streetz 🎶
Quack took his bag back 😂😂😂😂
Jhené killed it tho
"No." Shut the front door.
The lyrics... The current situation.. 🤯
The warlike cast astonishingly hang because dew postmeiotically wander worth a annoyed domain. old-fashioned, rapid cloakroom
Damn this like sound like she knew Quavo was gonna mess up lol
The witty tune bareilly ask because cabbage untypically breathe per a elfin sociology. breezy, cheerful close
My baby!!! Quavo don’t get your ass tore up
Damn! Jhene just added a lot of ice to this song!🙌🏿💯💯💯
She is the black Arrianna Grande in this video this record is dope and the video is FIRE.
So quavo slammec this girl wtf I would have been left glad you safe girl
The water sign energy isssss sooooooooo bomb!

She only teaching y’all women how to die alone. Send every dude back to the streets. Till you 40 with 3 grown kids and nobody on the streets will want you. Funny thing is the dudes you sending to the streets you already knew they was for it you just thought you could change them. Good luck being single 💯

Another song you can listen to after sending them back to the street and worth it is *B.S from Jhené Aiko ft Her*
A cancer will cancel you,  if you cheat. No matter what status you have in life.
Looking at this NOW!!! She's very  calculated makes you think if it was love at all.

Quavo made sure to take that Bentley before going back to the streets

Saweetie killed this shyt.
They tryna to sell Samsung, but it aint work sist.. 🤭
The first few lines drive the song home
First time I've seen this video.. it's so pretty. 💓
So Black people can say the N- word and others can't. It's against the right to equality.
Why does this song match my situation tho!!
This is a slap!
Am I the only one that's obsessed with this song ???
Saweetie this is your tune! Stick to this💕

She belongs to the streets
Saweetie really stepped it up & did her shit on this one! I like.💙🎶
i don't think ive ever seen a video where it tells me where the song starts hahah
I’m a kid :(
This is my new favorite song thanks sweetie
The streets this shit loving there movements Great job ladies Black girls Rock
I hear Big Sean in that Jhene Aiko verse. Defs his flow.
Dis my songgggggg
I think one of my new favorites I liked her since I heard her first song
Oh hell yasss...you sophisticated boo
Saweetie you and Huewbraa have to same thing in common... excited about trading his old man in for some new D..
THE VIBEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE😍😍😍
Pup play theme song     That is all
This the perfect song when you feeling pretty in your room and wanna vibe it out by yourself💗💗✨
Jhene ❤🧡
Okay but it’s the honey for me 🍯❤️
Jhene Aiko kills this
Yesss
It’s so  good

Idkk abt u but i got hisoka vibesss...
Can someone please tell me who that boy with sweetie is where she’s on the couch black jumpsuit
Love both
jhené aiko by herself on this one? 🤔🤔🤤🤤🔥🔥
me thinking was that cardi b at the end- This song is the besttt
i can't get enough of this song
Gorgeous 💗💗💗💗
Okay obviously we stand Miss Aiko in this house like that's a given she been fire I never stopped being fired I mean what... Might as well also say that the sky is blue and water is watery.  But so weedy just absolutely certain some smooth ass R&b vocals with her flow.  I mean to be able to have that confidence and have that delivery like she's had with some of her more hyped up songs but then to be able to switch the lane a bit and be able to rock that smooth fucking like honey mixed with creamy jif type of wave.  She killed this shit even without the future and then the future just makes it that much more wavy
i love this song
I love this song it make me think about my friends  we used to play music and dance ouside
The catchiest songs have the worst messages now, makes me believe witches really are praying over the songs before they go to distribution.
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍⁦🇩🇿⁩⁦🇩🇿⁩
At frist I thought this song was okay and then jhene came in and I was like hell yeah 🔥 fire
These bitches made an anthem for me 2 roll thru my hometown with when I got back for visits! Ayyyyeeeeeee
This is what happened when I searched up Female Music on google
Saweetie has improved so much .
That wig KILLS ME lol I know it’s suppose to be edgy saweetie but you she looks like a social justice warrior instead lol
no shoes in the house <:<
Love you doing ur thing
I was not vibing on this chick at all when she first came out I thought that my type song was kind of cringy and that repetitive kind of high-pitched hook over and over wasn't fucking with it.    But she's been getting in her bag with these recent singles and I'm here for it
2:25 is the best part 💯💯💯💯💯 but the song is great 👍her voice so beautiful
Not a fan of the new era singers today because their voice all sound the same unlike the 90s where all the female singers had unique voices and sound to their music but this song is pretty good probably the best female song i have heard in a while
Drăguț perivlu in lumea norilor pufoși cu așa trupuri duci de sexy
Godamn I'm obsessed
Wow😳 dat many haterz.!!!
And what about “Lil Mosey” his ft? 😂 he coulded easily jump on this one!

Hello
i love how all these little boys, yes little boys because men wouldn't react this way, are pressed. Woman have gone through so much shit and you little boys feel offended and get pressed when woman protect each other and when there's woman empowerment; disgusting, ya'll wanna talk about how everyone is defending females now and how everyone is equal and we are all equal of course but at the end of the day, woman are the true warriors. Back then the woman couldn't and did not complain when the little boys used them and when they had to do housework and when "men" basically ran everything and we couldn't do shit. Therefore, now since there's more freedom of course women are going to protect and voice for each other because back then we never had one opportunity to. There are little girls, yes little girls because a woman would not sexually abuse etc, who are predators and there are little boys who are too so I do not wanna hear how that s unfair because at the end of the day regardless of the gender a scum is a scum. Not every male is a little boy, the males who respect women and treat women like humans because we are humans and not every single female is a b*tch, slut, whore, etc for doing what they want to do are the true MVPs and they are men. But woman goes through so much each and every single day and I'm not saying that men don't either but every single day we go out and we have to mentally prepare ourselves for what will come our way as a female if there are any comments on this ill gladly respond back. I'm not a feminist but if me standing up for women and people, in general, is me being a feminist then go ahead and call me that. males won't get respect and love from women if they don't respect women and uplift them ❤.
Saweetie: back to the streets  Doja: streets  Lol
No question, The two BADDEST females in the game. 💯
Me waiting for jhenè akio part like.                     :👁👄👁
the song 96.1 the beat always has on
Can u make a 1hr video of this song or a instrumental
Just want to say, having this mindset is what keeps 75% of Black Women from never getting married. This music insures that our little girls, teenage girls and young women turn out to be single mothers. I’m not gone say the music is bad. But if you have a monetary price to be with you, Merriam Webster calls that prostitution.
Songs to play when the homies aren’t around:
Gives u a nostalgic feel
I thought her hands are big like kawhi lol
This lit💯
They look amazing in this 😍😍😍
can we stop arguing about stuf that is'nt about the song. just listen the song
The creativity in this video 😳 finally some art in videos whoever directed and editted is the 🐐
RICH BOY. SAWEETIE= "QUAVO"
My Fav song 🥺💘
This look just like the start of motivation
Honestly they queens and we appreciate them  Only those who honestly appreciate get to like this comment
About 97/100 of the top 100 all sound the same, solo artists, boring, toy, unoriginal, full of unnecessary video effects, this cheap canned rubbish is the reason why all I ever here played out  is 80's and 90's music as the music is from real rock bands. very disappointing.
This is so pretty!! Uhh
Now I can't stop playing this!
Jhene should colab with they boy from AKMU....he writes most of their songs :P
I Love your videos so much and I love you too
Wow this is a feel good song the best is so relaxing love sweetie
Drive to your local strip club.   This song has been on rotation every 5 minutes...LOL
Worst editing ever. What a shit video
Saweetie is 🔥💕🤩
This Is Me😍💞♥️⭐✨🤩
Wow
This is such a delicate yet powerful video! I'm obsessed!
That first wig is so ugly
I love this song🤑😎🤩😛😂🤫🤭😻👸✌
Saweetie & Jhene's scene together gave me some nostalgia and reminded me of the 'Fairytale; whimsicality' that Nicki brought to her video 'Fly' with Rihanna, in her debut days. I almost cried, yo.. 😢😫😭😍 2:55 - 3:07
Lada dee da dee da...back to da streetz 💅🏾💅🏾

She is so pretty! Her style is amazing! Only one I can see pulling off that short patchy hair style.

Aeko wrote this for her you can tell by the cadence and words she uses
Soo tired of this I'm a thot buy me attitude from chics like Sweetie I guarantee she'd be the first talking that you should respect me but claim you have a price tag? No thanks that ratchet golddigger shit is for the birds rather have a 6 or 7 if you so called bad bitches that think they 10's are basically hookers that can be purchased I'm Gucci thanks! But Miss Aeko ! 200 percentage baddie! With class! Sooooo sexy no price tag I'm sure...
Sounds awesome on 1.25
Beat is 🔥
A fairy ✨🧚🏽‍♀️ and a ice queen❄️👸🏽

GO   HARD  SAWEETIE  RIGHT NOW
🔥🔥🔥🔥
HOW WAS THIS RELEASED 1 month ago and I only found out now wtf was Saweetie on a shadow ban 😭
Can anyone explain to me if my guess on the term "From the Streets"  is right or least close?  My guess is that the term "From the Streets" is a metaphor for someone who is in a state of mind or daily consciousness where they dont want to settle yet, or know they dont wanna settle down ever which there is nothing wrong with that. But the issue lies in when they try to pursue and/or end up in relationships with people that do want to settle down and are ready and one or both parties do this consciously which will only result in a toxic and messy relationship because they want very different things at the moment or in the future. Having your own stance and plans of your relationship status isnt an issue, the issue lies in when you get with, or try to get with someone that has a plan/stance that doesnt match up with yours.   Or least that's my idea of it. 🤷🏾‍♀️
Woke up with this damn song stuck in my head bc my 11 yr old daughter listening to this crap for the last week I didn't even pay attention to the lyricks 😬😬😬

ACCEPT JESUS AS LORD AND SAVIOR!!!!! JESUS IS LORD AMEN!!!!!!!!!!
Happy new year
Blasian power X 2 IM HERE FOR ITTTTT 🙌🏼💫💫💫💫💫
I’m hearing the ice cream man at the end. The visuals are so colorful
THE BIBLE SAYS:   They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might, (2 Thessolians 2:9)  And throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. (Matthew 13:15)  But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.” (Revelation 21:8)  THIS DOES NOT HAVE TO BE YOU. JESUS CHRIST PAID THE PENALTY FOR YOUR SINS 2,000 YEARS AGO ON THE CROSS AND IF YOU REPENT OF YOUR SINS AND ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST AS LORD AND SAVIOR THEN YOU WILL BE SAVED FROM HELL. HE LOVES YOU AND DOES NOT WANT YOU TO GO. REPENT AND TURN TO JESUS TODAY.
😍😍😍😘

Somewhere between “Believing in happy endings” and “Accepting the reality”, we grew up!! ​ Somewhere between “stealing eclairs of your sis” and “Bringing Silk for her”, we grew up!! ​ Somewhere between “Paint” and “MS Excel”, we grew up!!

All fake. Don't be mind controlled by the filters. Sex selllllllllssss. I like both these women but they love labels and tag lines over everything.
This is a fRaCtiOn of what Latifah, MC Lyte, Lauryn Hill and even Kim and Nikki were doing. When did female rappers become such a non fACtoR? This some real loWEst cOMmoN deNoMiNator type mess. Y'all do the math.

Children united all together, let us also turn to the Eternal Father !!! * Therapeutic indications * www.padreceleste.com  * Dear brothers, instead of useless thoughts among other useless projects, we optimize everything and therefore I take this opportunity to offer you a mutual and collective collaboration achieved through prayer. Let me explain immediately: together with some of you I have formed a prayer group that I have baptized "Trinity Network", which consists in a communion of universal brotherhood based on the love of God the Father. Every evening, after dinner or in any case before going to sleep, each of us performs prayers from our own home together with the other participants, scattered around the world. The prayer takes place on the knees and with the hands joined, starting with a moderate voice with the Our Father, the Hail Mary and the Glory to the Father; (Important ... let's not separate our hands, as the Eternal communicates with the soul and we lose contact). When we begin to pray, we can be disturbed by external forces, such as thoughts, useless things, digressions, and more. Through several repetitions of the prayers, the whole moves away, since even if we wanted to think something, it would be impossible to do it. Later we will start with a greeting addressed to God and with the phrase "Hello Eternal Father."; below is an account of the problems or problems that concern us, with a plea for help from the Eternal. Our prayer group draws from the church the three main prayers, Our Father, the Hail Mary and the Glory be to the Father; (the easiest and most known to people) and authorizes them with a familiar conversation with God, in which you can talk about everything with the Almighty, ranging from everyday trivialities to serious problems, in a word a true 360 degree dialogue. Between one anecdote and another and at the end of the conversation, it is necessary to repeat the Our Father, the Hail Mary and the Glory be to the Father once. For this, by praying together, the presence of God is simultaneous in all hearts and this facilitates his intervention. Having felt the benefit, it was decided to repeat the morning and / or afternoon prayer. Obviously, if the commitments of daily life do not allow you to pray in the morning or in the afternoon, do not worry: you can move it to another time of the day, the Eternal understands and knows why you do it. However, it is essential that the evening prayer be done without delay. I guarantee you the absolute benefit of the teaching used up to now and I assure you that the dialogue with the Supreme frees the soul from impurities and brings peace and well-being. I enclose my most sincere greetings, in my name and in the name of the other brothers of the prayer group, hoping to be more and more numerous. A hug Ludmilla! I received this prayer teaching in a social network from a girl who advised me to read it carefully, not to delete it, to offer it to family and to give it to friends, because it will be appreciated better than any good food, as it is useful for improving the 'soul! he sent him to make God known I enclose your prayers! The sign of the cross, in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be your name, Come your kingdom Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread, forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. Help us not to fall into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen Ave or Maria full of grace, the Lord is with you. You are blessed among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of Jesus, pray for us sinners, now and in the hour of our death. Amen Glory to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, now and always and always.

Love video love 💕 it always sweetie ladies good morning
Beautiful voice
When Jhene said "Consider yourself blessed , you get to f**k with the baddest" All my Ex's felt that
i don't seem to be able to get past the language
@cristine jackson its a japanese skin lightening lotion. It says in the article the hollywood african american celebrities use it and it doesnt even make them look black anymore but really light skinned,although they deny it https://matsuiskinlightening.com/products/bleaching-skin-lightening-orange-peeling-lotion-100-ml-top-selling-product i guess the reason they deny using this lotion is probably they want people to think they are naturally light skinned,people should just be honest.
This song is still underrated idc.
Keep viben

Hey to whoever reads this. This Is a sign, Jesus loves you so so much and He has been right beside you through it all. He suffered and died for you and me. He will give you peace and take away your burdens. Please REPENT. He will make you new... 2 Corinthians 5:17. Come as you are. There isn’t any special thing you have to do. All you have to do is believe that Jesus is Lord. And make Him your personal Lord and saviour. And learn how to flee away from your old ways. He wants the best for you so please seek Him, repent and change. Start a relationship with Him. It doesn't hurt. It can start off as simple as having a conversation with Him as soon as you wake up and before you go to bed. Eventually He will guide you into what scriptures to read and how to pray. He loves and cares for you so so much. God bless and have a great day :)
💗💞💋🍀🍄🌞🌍✨🌈 how this song makes me feel!!!
I like this
this is so cute
Ha
megalovania remix
Nice product placement. Lol. Subtle.
Any song jhene in will Always be 🔥
This the anthem ladies!!
saweetie you look cute
COVIDNINETEEN VACINATIONS, THE 1ST STEP TOWARDS THE MARK OF THE BEAST IS HERE SOON. A great and formidable enemy seeks to enter into the very blood of My children through the altering of your DNA. Because of the curse that came about after the fall of the first man Adam, I came to make a way for you. You are renewed and made clean again by your belief and salvation in Me, your King and Messiah, sent by My Father to redeem you by My blood sacrifice on the Cross of Calvary. Only through Me, the Door, corruptible is made incorruptible, unredeemable made redeemable. I have ransomed you in order to bring creation back to its Creator. Creator YHWH was made flesh to overcome death, hell, and the grave, and to take what was tainted and impure and make it whole again. The spiritual battle that is raging now is ultimately to strip you of the Divine image of Myself that has been placed within the DNA of My creation. Ask Me for more wisdom and revelation about this and it will be given to you. The veil was torn, access granted when I shed My blood, died and rose again. We have created you in Our image, and when you walk in holiness, righteousness and purity, obeying My commandments, I am enthroned on your heart. You are then transformed in body, soul and spirit. When this transformation occurs, the very frequency of your cells then resonates with Me and raises you closer to your Creator and further away from the lower realm and lower frequencies which keep you bound. This is by design, and when indwelled, My Holy Spirit will be the gatekeeper of your heart, and your entire being, My sanctuary, and the place where I reside in you. When this occurs, My Kingdom is on earth, as it is in Heaven. It is then that I am able to provide victory over the curse for you, preserving the Divine design I have placed within your DNA. There are many layers of revelation to know what is coded there and hidden, secrets to be revealed to only those who overcome. However, if the gates are breached by sin, lack of obedience, compromise, or lukewarmness, the enemy sets up thrones (strongholds) instead of Me, because my laws, My Word have not been written on your hearts. You have a sworn enemy whose utter mission is to destroy you. He will stop at nothing, and as My Word has foretold, the time is here when the greatest of all violence and evil against My people, those made in My image, is taking place. The battle is for the soul, and the battle is about the blood. Satan’s ultimate goal from the beginning was to corrupt the seed, corrupt the blood that carries My blueprint in you, My design for those made in Our image, your DNA. There is only one way to ensure that My Throne is upon your heart and your eternal destination is sealed, or your soul will be lost forever. Your must be born again. Your heart must be sealed with My blood. You must be quick to repent often and seek holiness above all else. Love what is true and just. Be extremely careful what your eyes see and your ears hear. This is guarding your heart, guarding its gate. It is in sealing these portals to the soul, in commanding the spirit to govern or have mastery over the soul, that you overcome. You will then be prepared for My return, and be protected from the evil one. If you have not already done so, seal the portals to the enemy now! Confess your sins and repent for the midnight hour is here! Bind the access points that have given satan legal rights within your temples, within your body, mind, soul and spirit. Give satan and all his dark kingdom a certificate of divorce and be free from the bondage, and from all the oppression and possession in your bloodline immediately! Break the curse from your ancestors back to Adam. Cover it all with My blood and command the enemy out of your bloodline, sealing it as well, the gates to your heart, using the authority you have been given through Me. Exercise dominion as a gatekeeper and a son or daughter of the Most High God, taking your positions as heirs to My Kingdom. My Holy Spirit will then have permission to use you for My glory and manifest through you in this crucial hour. *(Please see the prayers on the right hand side bar and the one titled Increased Demonic Warfare Prayer covers everything He is instructing here)* This must be done this moment!! This is crucial! Precious moments remain before the implementation of the enemy’s plan to destroy the DNA of My creation, making you forever unredeemable. The Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and it must be taken by force! Take My Holy Word and dispossess what has had control of your gateways and that of your family line through covenants, oaths, soul trades and agreements made by your ancestors. Do it this moment! In Me you will be made FREE! The implementation of the plans to alter your DNA and make it programmable by something other than Me, your Creator, are here. I control and govern the DNA I have placed within you, but if you allow man to administer anything within your bodies, that will recode your DNA, I will no longer be the controller. I will no longer recognize you as My creation. You will have become a mixture of something else, an altered form of man and technology, and therefore, not in My image any longer. Do you understand what I am saying? Truly the hour is here when you must prepare to make the choice to remain fully human, infused with My Spirit. The enemy wants nothing more than to deceive you through propaganda, fear and manipulation and cause you to allow either a mark or an implant (vaccine or digital tattoo) into your bodies that will forever separate you from Me. This is your reality right now! You must know what you will choose to do. When you open doors to the enemy through sin and through your choices in life outside of My ways, the demonic spirits appoint gatekeepers over your heart, your mind, and your soul. Then those spirits invite more, and when no repentance occurs, strongholds occur. The heart of an unregenerate man is wicked and deceitful above all things. But My Word is quick, powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing apart of your soul and spirit, your joints and marrow, as I discern the thoughts and intentions of your heart. Allow Me to write My laws on your heart and you will know truth at last. You will know what is now directly in front of you and the choices that are here for you and your loved ones. My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge, but it does NOT have to be this way. Allow My glory to penetrate your spirit so that your soul will come under submission. To not allow this, means you will remain in bondage and you will be easily deceived. If I do not dwell in you fully, and your gates have been breached, another will easily influence you and take governance. My people, I have given you the keys to the Kingdom. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in Heaven and whatever is loosed on earth will be loosed in Heaven. Bind the strongman, bind the strongholds on your life and be delivered! The technology for the mark of the beast is here. It is upon you. It will be presented at first to be taken voluntarily, then very soon after, you will not be able to buy, sell or work. Do not wait another moment. Come out of Babylon and make Me King of your heart, the Divine Gatekeeper of your soul. The evil ones have set in motion their wicked schemes, as it must be so according to My Word. Many, many judgments will occur as I allow them. This is to wake up My church. You must know where you stand in your walk with Me, because in an instant, everything will change, and there will not be another opportunity to choose, because the choice will be made for you. You are either all in, or I am turning you over to your carnal mind and nature. You have the choice My loves, choose life and eternity in Me over eternal death in darkness.The time is now.  YAHUSHUA, JESUS THE CHRIST.  256
Yess gurl!!
LA😀DA😀DEE😀DA😀DEE😀DA😀BACK TO THE STREETS🥲
Should I ask why the sofa is covered in plastic?... Or should I leave that well alone?...probably best left alone, yeah! Also, where did this notion that dressing like a productive  street walker, become the idea of Beauty? Must be Women's liberation I guess.

Did Saweetie and Quavo break up?

Sounds like a 90s sample.
Hit maka?
John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Amen. Repent and turn from sin! Follow God's sacred 10 Commandments! Time is running out!
Btw showout to these two bad Asian ladies!
This saweetie best song. Very professional compared to all her other songs.
Bruh jene aiko can fucking rap with melody freal. Better meg the stallion and alot of these other female rappers.

Pro song
The 5.5k people who disliked the video are some haters
Str8 fire
If I wasn't watching the video, I would've thought it was Doja Cat posing on the 2nd verse
I would love to see her perform this at Savage x Fenty 3
Jheneeeeeee yassss
I like
So hit the like for Team leash , dislike for Team lease 🤷🏿‍♂️
i uploaded the male remix version on my channel, i rewrote the whole verse & told my story of how i used to hang out with the wrong people, party, drink, take drugs & how i’ve now changed my life around for the better!! CHECK IT OUT 🤗
WHAT AN ABSOLUTE BANGER!!!! Bringing back good RnB vibesss 🔥💕
Jhene is not a singer
There’s something about Saweetie that you can’t help but like . I wanna see her win 💓 Jhene aiko’s voice is soo soothing 😍😍
Honestly that girl going bald was a terrible choice and why does she the best only the last 3 seconds of the video.

I just love saweetie, this video is so dope 😍 saweetie never fails 🥰 both saweetie and Jhene is gorgeous
Her and her stupid name
Yooo can I just say how crazy it is that Saweetie can switch up her voice like that?! She sounds mad hard in My Type, but here she sounds so mellow.
Just a rap from Tyga would've made this the ultimate BLASIAN track, with steve lacy, toro y moi, apl.de.ap, h.e.r, cassie and amerie on the remix Lol.
im so tired of jhene aiko :( i want the old jhene back like at least if you gone do somethin like this do it with an actual good rapper like B.I.A lol now if they made a song together thatd be fire. This is just stupid im sorry XD  how this b***bald but got her head lookin like cotton candy I didnt even know that was possible  lmfao
I like the fact that she was using an Android🥰
Their voices are so seductive and mesmerizing, I could listen to them talk or sing or rap all day lol
Stds ???
When I first heard this I was like "This gives me Jhene aiko vibes" then she comes on the second verse lol
I listen this song every single day stop me :V
Is this referring to quavo?
The aesthetic is mad cute 💜💜💜💜
Y'all be sleeping on this song it's so good and chill soooooo good!!!!!!!!!
I feeling this shit, good collabo🔥🔥🔥

Jhene literally carried this song for those few seconds and the song started making sense💅
She's a proud streets
Finally someone makes a song about sending men to the streets when men use to say" she for the streets"😂
Never heard a song by her until this one , thought she was SZA as I always heard this on the radio.

Next thing upgrade 🔥🔥
This Blasian collab is ASRONOMICAL 😍

OK MA'AM I SEE U SERVING
Ooooh yes two black and Asian queens damn I love this so much 👸🏽👸🏻💪🏼💯❤️
This song is amazing 🔥🔥🔥
She looks like cardi b. Lol
Saweetie: *Hires an Asian guy to star in her MV because he’s hot Her fans: “OMG look who just created a new race 😱 am in such aw 👁👄👁 “
The water sign energy in this song 🙌🏼🙌🏼 looove this song !
I love how this is a representation of her childhood! It's her Mom braiding her up, and her aunt Whitney who opened/slammed the door!!!! This gave me so much childhood vibes in Long BEACH! I love how WESTCOAST THIS IS WITH 2 BEST COAST FEMALES: JHENE & SAWEETIE
Now, I was just imagining how wrong this would be if the n word had a hard R and it was by a white artist instead😂
Ooof, that beautiful man at 1:49 🤤🤤🤤 Is he a model??? Someone tag him!!!
Tinkerbell glow ups? 😳🧚
This is my song now. I need this on my ring tone.
Saweetie is way more better than cardi b
I get some bay area vibes 😍

Another great song ,  SOS. People accross the world please do not take the nwo  untested depopulation death vaccine and live to enjoy more great songs like this one ,  the untested vaccine is a no brainer do not gamble with your lives
Literally zoomed through the whole thing to just hear jhene’s small verse
I actually love Jhene’s music but as for this feature...  I can’t look past the bs Sawatee said about, if the guy she’s with ain’t buying her Berkin bags and paying her bills (like she can’t pay her own damn bills), then send him back to the streets.... I’m actually getting sick of hearing this type of sh*t talk from the likes of Cardi B, Megan the Stallion and this one.... I’d prefer Jhene not get behind this kind of disrespectful vibe but hey...
geeez, let's drop that finale bae... this shit's on fire bru
This is a dream. They are so angelic and beautiful. Also I’m so glad Jhené is in this song omggg. Such a vibe  high too💜🥂🦋

This is definitely a BOP! Love this style of Saweetie. I feel like this is her own style and she’s not trying.... it’s flowing. Her other songs are poppin, but they feel forced.
I forgot her name isn't actually saweetie ☠
Ok but I still can't believe this is the same girl that made tap in.
Young Thug: Put her on a chain, that ain't like me.  Saweetie: I put my new man on a leash
This song got me through a rough breakup 🙏💋bye boy

If just one person reads this it will make my day. I'm a music artist from Brooklyn. So I'm fully aware that ppl usually post these comments all the time, but I honestly do believe that I'll be the one person who you'll be so happy that you did hear out. I'm currently trying to get 1,000 subscribers.. If ONE PERSON could just give this a thumbs up, you will be a great step closer to helping a person's dreams come true. I swear that Im not wack and you won't be disappointed. I Just need one chance and 2 minutes. Thank you.

🥳🥳🥳ALSOOOMMEEE
Ugly ass cards b bitter af watching this video hahaha
I love how jhene  emphasize,   "Good boy"!  But! she's  still for streets. City boyz  lost a point tho, I still fell for her .😚🥰😍
???
The vibe feels like an early 2000 kind of RnB, or is it just me..
I love the vibe and imagery but as for the message it's a no. but yall sound very angelic
Ayyyyyyyeeeeee new single anthem 2021
This seems to calm to be a saweetie song but it’s a vide doe😩
I want one for Christmas sexy
who here loves saweetie music cuz i do
I love how she drinking jack daniels Honey
My jam
I just saw this on my ad a week ago then i came back..❗
Can't believe I'm here coz Wendy Williams put me on 😆😆
Yass! Both hood/humble
This is giving me doja cat vibes.
This song is only teaching all young women and little girls how to disrespect themselves and become a whore. SMGDH these artists most all are Puppets & Salves to destroy the young before their even able to understand the quality of being a real woman or even knowing what one is.
Luv Jhene Aiko throwing up NEYBAHOOD when saying ‘on hood’ 🥳
Doja cat needs to be in  tha remix of this song for real!! It already sounds like something shed drop
i  LOVE the song....BUT not the visuals ! ..............im sorry.
She found her sound
Saweetie really cut her hair and looks like a GODDESS!
I'm not even a jhene fan but she dominated this song with beautiful hi notes
Damn cuh she really did the et huh??!!
I cannot..not like this..😊How can you not like this.
Alu <<< le yah kauguu ah le mea gae maga'o i ai le yah makaga kama Fred <<< go eat the fame <<<  yup <<< and I'm not your slave <<< for any network
That's how hard I go <<< you can have the fame UFA <<< and all the laughs you want in the parking lot with the rest of them
It means a lot to us to have an Asian face on camera. 1:50

this song got stuck in my head
If anyone would even pick up a Bible for more then 5 minutes you can see how blantenly obvious the signs are getting. This is what Jesus warned us about guys! It’s coming to pass. Please get a relationship with Him before it’s too late! Please watch my videos to hear my testimony and above all please read the Bible!!! If you would like to talk or even need a Bible get a hold of me please!!!! God bless ❤️
I'm really enjoying your videos I am a fan of yours from laurel maryland god bless you and your family this holiday season
I’ve been playing this song all week I even got my Spanish speaking mom to say the “la da dee da dee da” part yasssss

Life is so sweet when you have your family around you, I'm so excited to share this testimony I lost my man to 27 year old girl who cast a spell on him, I cry out for help for the past 4 weeks I have been looking for a way for me to get him back.  One day i discus it with my friend she gave me a solution she said i should contact Dr Audu, a great and powerful spell caster who can do all things.  I told him my problems to cast a very powerful spell and in seven days, my husband was back to me all thanks to Dr Audu, a great spell caster if you need help to get your ex back, Contact website: https://auduherbalhealinghome.webs.com/ WhatsApp him: +254796886409, Email him at: contactdraudu@gmail.com

I can't be the only one to notice Saweetie looked at Jhene type funny when shawty scene came. Envy & competition are so obvious in today's artist. I crave selfless artistry more than ever these days, its unfortunate.
1:27   The last one got on my last nerve Made me go change my password  That line is Sa-weet-ie

Damn this is a vibe
*Future rolling in his grave*
Looking at this video, this whole thing was so *aesthetic* and such a vibe .
Just as you would with other people, after saying you are sorry you must ask to be forgiven. There is no special prayer you have to pray to earn forgiveness from God. All you have to do is ask him to forgive you, through Jesus Christ, and believe that he will forgive you.❤️ God bless you all. God loves you and so do  I.

...I’m sure this is one of Lori Harveys’ favourite songs
I love the song it’s on repeat but I don’t think the video really had anything to do with the song. It was pretty nontheless but should have been taken in a different direction.
Just came from watching Meg's Body video - honestly love how Saweetie & Jhene can still convey bad biish energy without the shock factor.
I might just be really 🍃 or did saweetie lowkey look like cardi w no tattoo at the end?!
I really can’t get enough of this song 🔥 @saweetie
1:49 Shoutout Saweetie for the asian representation to mainstream media!!!
One of the best music videos Ive ever seen. Amazing work Saweetie and Jhené Aiko🥰🤩🦋🌼💖
Turned My Head When I Heard Jhene's Voice🔥🔥🔥🥺💯🎶🎶
One of the few times I've seen a phone in a video and wanted it 😡😭😭😭
YESSSS SAWEETIE ❤ I LOVE YOUUU 😭💕
SAWEETIE LOOKS LIKE SHE MOISTURIZE 24/7 SMELLING LIKE VANILLA COTTON CANDY
HONEYJACK ALLDAY🌻🐝🍯😘😜🤪😝😋😋😋
Yes SAWEETIE get that product placement COIN 🤑🤑
ur voice is so  chill and cute love it
This is what we call music.., ❤️👌🏻
Ok SO JONESTLY I WAS NEVER A FAN OF SAWEETIE MUSIC N JUST THOUGHT OK ANOTHER BADDIE WITH THE SAME SHIT TO HALF ASS RAP ABOUT BUT THIS OPENS UP NOT JUST ANOTHER SIDE BUT ANOTHER LEVEL OF SAWEETIE...OHHH N IM HEAR FOR IT
Beat feels like « my neck, my back » beat on 1,25x speed.
Love the videography but at the same time it let me down. The very beginning led me to believe that the video was going to tell a story visually.
Boringgggg🥴
I don't remember paying for youtube premium
A imagem me lembrou a de Motivation
both are blasian, jhene is a pisces, saweetie is a cancer. love to see it. (imma piscean btw te he)
Better than Megan tbh
For all the people saying finally Asian representation ok one hip hop was created by Latinos African Americans and Jamaican immigrants in the Bronx so Asian culture wasn’t in hip hop also do you see black people in kpop jpop and Asian countries and their genres no. I am glad she is representing her Asian and black side but this isn’t about race just enjoy the damn song
It in 0.5x is soooo Chopped and screwed
J wrote the whole song...
The difference between socialism and "democratic socialism" is the exact same as the difference between murder and suicide.  Just because they put the gun on the table and try to convince you it's a good idea, doesn't make the result any different.  Most communist regimes initially got into power with a vote (combined with fraud to be sure) where some people were convinced that it was a good idea.  That's what CNN and their co-conspirators are working toward now.

PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD EVER DO AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES ARE YOU 100% SURE THAT IF YOU DIED TODAY THAT YOU WOULD GO TO HEAVEN? (CLICK 'READ MORE')  There are some things that you should know:  1. Realize that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior:  Ro 3:23 "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"  Ro 3:10 "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"  It all began when the first humans, Adam and Eve were created and God put them in the garden of Eden. God created them perfect to live in fellowship with Him. There was no death or sorrow. God told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed God and as a result, sin entered into the world. The pain, which this world sees, is the result of sin.  2. Because of our sins, we die both spiritually and physically, but God sent His Son to die so that you can have a chance not to have to go to hell by accepting what He did on the cross:  Ro 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."  Ro 5:8 "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."  Every person who has ever lived is a sinner and is not righteous because we do bad things. A sin is a crime against God, just as if you steal something at the store, it is punishable by going to jail. It's the same thing with sin. Lying, stealing, sex before marriage, pride, hatred, ect. are all sins. Hell is a prison for those who commit crimes against God. That’s because you must be perfect in order to get to heaven. No matter how well you live your life from then on, you have already sinned, which will be punished if you are not pardoned. If you commit a crime, and then live as a good citizen you still will go to jail for the crime you committed. Right? Just as the President can pardon a crime so you won't go to jail, Jesus can pardon your sins so that you do not go to hell, and can go to heaven when you die. You won’t have to pay for your own sins because Jesus already did that for you. But if you reject the pardon that He offers, you will have to pay for your own sins by going to hell.  3. If you will confess Jesus Christ as Your Lord, place your Faith in Him and Believe in your heart that He died, shed His blood and rose again as a sacrifice for your sins, you will be saved (from hell).  Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.   Heb 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  You cannot get to heaven by being a good person, going to church, baptism or any other way other than by turning to Jesus, believing in your heart that He died on the cross and rose from the dead for your sins and placing your Faith in Him. While these are good things to do, some people believe that they will get to heaven, but your Faith must be in Christ and His sacrifice alone and nothing else, giving your life to Him.   Eph 2:8,9 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.  Ro 10:9,10;13 "that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved..For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."  4.  You must submit your life to Jesus Christ and His will in Faith, believing in your heart that He died and rose again shedding His blood to pay for your sins as a sacrifice to God.  If you want to accept Jesus free gift of salvation, or if you have any doubts about whether or not you are going to heaven, HUMBLY PRAY THIS PRAYER TO GOD FROM YOUR HEART IN FAITH:  ”Dear Lord Jesus I know that I  am a sinner and need you to save me.  I believe that You are the Lord and believe in my heart that You died on the Cross and Rose from the dead, shedding your blood as a Sacrifice for my sins.  I turn to You as the only way of salvation, I submit my life to you, I submit my will to yours, I place my Faith and Trust in You alone as Lord of my life, Please save me and I thank You for it, in Jesus holy name, Amen.”  If you have truly placed your faith in Jesus Christ as your Lord, submitting your life to Him, you can know that you are a child of God and on your way to heaven.  Now that you are on your way to heaven, you should attend a bible believing church and follow in baptism..
Love seeing all these beautiful Asians and melanin queens in the video! God damn aren't we all beautiful! 💜💜
how do you wipe your ass with nails that long?  generally curious. nice video.

JOIN THIS SERVER https://sites.google.com/view/fundiscordserver
This song lowkey has a really good message for young women that's dope
Escape eternal hell🔥🔥🔥. For God so loved the 🌎 world that whomsoever beleive in him shall not perish but have everlasting life! No matter the sin or struggle come to cry out to him! He forgives to the uttermost the one to come to God through Jesus Christ. Why live for few years in sin and hell when whomsoever repents and come to Jesus Christ shall be saved from sin and hell.   He inherits everlasting life with Jesus Christ. He the Lord Jesus Christ is the author of life and all who come to Him in true repentance and faith shall live even if he dies.  Bless the name of Jesus Christ,  because God is abundant in mercy, loving-kindness, and by no means clears the guilty. His word the bible is a lamp unto our 👣 🚶feet.1

this song is addictive actually.
So I'm just hearing about this new queen I saw her interview on Wendy. Um does anyone remember Serayah on Empire?  No shade at all but this new young lady is definitely giving me Tiana vibes! When I close my eyes and listen to Back to the streets, I see Serayah aka Tiana. Just my opinion! Not a bad thing either. Nice music sis.
💗💓💚💖❣️💛💜💙🖤💟💞
I love this song 🎵 🥰🥰🤞🏽🤞🏽
I actually like this Saweetie song. She should do more songs like this and only rap a lil bit. Bay Area vibes.
Song fake af, both girls are in committed relationships they're not passing anything around but this song Is catchy and fire lol
Legit obsessed with this song
Video is to fly 💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥
Behind the scenes https://youtu.be/ST7ebI2QIZ8
Looks like the director is a shadowhunters fan! Jhene's scene looks like a nod to the Sealy queen and Saweetie is obviously portraying the famous E.T scene but in her own unique  way.I love it ladies! Beautiful!

This song is the worst
Lol she’s me riding to the hair store before I go to heaven for my new wig 😭
Autotune on point
technically a man can't be for the streets because men can't get pregnant and left... and women love men who other women brag about and will get in line to be the 8th baby momma
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS ONE 💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻
they look so cute in that garden😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
Favorite song

Saweetie. Is. So. Pretty. 👀❤❤❤❤that. 👧  so. Im. A. Fan
They sound good asf together ❤💙❤💚🧡💜
1 Timothy 4 Now the Spirit speaketh expressively that in the last days many will depart from the true faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils; speaking lies and hypocrisy, having their conscience seared with a hot iron; forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats; which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth  For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be refused if it be received with thanksgiving   God bless y’all! Have a good day.
this video is a aesthetic✨
Damn about time she made something that sounds like something 💕

If you are watching this in November 2020, just know you're a legend
Cardi B and Nicki Minaj 2 in 1 = Saweetie 😄
I'm not saying i listened to this 5 times in a row but...
Here to foe my girl Saweetie and Jhene
Because of the increasing rate that prophecy is being fulfilled, this world is quickly coming to a close. The great tribulation is about to begin, the worst time this world will ever know. God the Father wants to have a relationship with His creation. But everyone is born into sin and we need a way for us to be able to live eternally with the Father in heaven. Jesus made that way. Even though He is God, He left heaven and came to earth to be a sacrifice for a lost world. He never sinned. He was abandoned by His friends, was betrayed by Judas and handed over to be crucified. He was beaten so badly that He could not be recognized as a man. Then He willingly suffered an agonizing drawn out death on the cross. He was buried and on the third day God raised Him from the dead. And now He sits at the right hand of the Father and He is coming back any day now to Take home those who belong to Him. Just believe that He died for your sins.  You don't have to repent of sins. People who teach that, are wrong and they are not saved.  You don't have to give up drinking or drugs, etc. Just have faith that Jesus fully paid the price. After you are saved rest in Jesus' sacrifice. God will guide you and help you get rid of bad habits and to do good works according to His will. If you think you should do works, you're saying Jesus' sacrifice was not enough. Faith plus works will NOT save you. Once you believe that Jesus died for your sins, you will receive the Holy Spirit and you are sealed for eternity. Nothing you do or don't do can cause you to lose your salvation. Those who say that you can lose it are not saved. There is nothing we can do! It's all about what Jesus did! God gave us free will but He is a just God.  Rejecting salvation means an agonizing eternity in hell! In the great tribulation, the age of grace will be over and to be saved you must believe on Jesus plus resist taking the mark of the beast. Believe on Jesus now and you will escape having to go through the great tribulation!         I will try to answer if you have any questions.        For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16
Two of the baddest bitches okayyyyy
Love it!! Back to the streets! Yes!!

I start my day with this song. Got me feeling like a bad bitch!!
Let’s talk about the diversity in the women in this MV!!!
After "My type" this is my favorite song of her🔥🔥
Rich boy got him on deck ? Oh-
this’d play in a roblox vibe train
“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil.” John 3:16-19  Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.” John 8:12
jhene <3
Ok since nobody’s going to point it out I’m just going to say it: SAWEETIE HAS HISOKA’s STAR AND DROP ON HER CHEEK 😀✌🏾✨

Saweetie is a music genius,,this is  definitely a masterpiece....in fact,,lately mostly all of the female rappers seem to only know how to make freaky sexual songs,,this is why I'm happy that Saweetie has not followed the trend,,and she created a real genuine pure great song that does not include heavy sexual overtones.....respect......also,,much respect to jhene aiko,,her verse was spectacular....and big respect to the video visual graphics creators,,the video visuals and graphics were phenomenal....
Ouuu loving it😍.....idk but doja just came up hearing this she would go hard on dis to💯

Big up kurupt lyrics scheme from jhene aiko
They're both half asian ❤❤
PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD EVER DO AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES  ARE YOU 100% SURE THAT IF YOU DIED TODAY THAT YOU WOULD GO TO HEAVEN? (CLICK 'READ MORE')    There are some things that you should know:    1. Realize that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior:    Ro 3:23 "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"    Ro 3:10 "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"    It all began when the first humans, Adam and Eve were created and God put them in the garden of Eden. God created them perfect to live in fellowship with Him. There was no death or sorrow. God told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed God and as a result, sin entered into the world. The pain, which this world sees, is the result of sin.    2. Because of our sins, we die both spiritually and physically, but God sent His Son to die so that you can have a chance not to have to go to hell by accepting what He did on the cross:    Ro 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."    Ro 5:8 "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."    Every person who has ever lived is a sinner and is not righteous because we do bad things. A sin is a crime against God, just as if you steal something at the store, it is punishable by going to jail. It's the same thing with sin. Lying, stealing, sex before marriage, pride, hatred, ect. are all sins. Hell is a prison for those who commit crimes against God. That’s because you must be perfect in order to get to heaven. No matter how well you live your life from then on, you have already sinned, which will be punished if you are not pardoned. If you commit a crime, and then live as a good citizen you still will go to jail for the crime you committed. Right? Just as the President can pardon a crime so you won't go to jail, Jesus can pardon your sins so that you do not go to hell, and can go to heaven when you die. You won’t have to pay for your own sins because Jesus already did that for you. But if you reject the pardon that He offers, you will have to pay for your own sins by going to hell.    3. If you will confess Jesus Christ as Your Lord, place your Faith in Him and Believe in your heart that He died, shed His blood and rose again as a sacrifice for your sins, you will be saved (from hell).    Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.     Heb 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.    You cannot get to heaven by being a good person, going to church, baptism or any other way other than by turning to Jesus, believing in your heart that He died on the cross and rose from the dead for your sins and placing your Faith in Him. While these are good things to do, some people believe that they will get to heaven, but your Faith must be in Christ and His sacrifice alone and nothing else, giving your life to Him.     Eph 2:8,9 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.    Ro 10:9,10;13 "that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved..For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."    4.  You must submit your life to Jesus Christ and His will in Faith, believing in your heart that He died and rose again shedding His blood to pay for your sins as a sacrifice to God.  If you want to accept Jesus free gift of salvation, or if you have any doubts about whether or not you are going to heaven, HUMBLY PRAY THIS PRAYER TO GOD FROM YOUR HEART IN FAITH:    ”Dear Lord Jesus I know that I  am a sinner and need you to save me.  I believe that You are the Lord and believe in my heart that You died on the Cross and Rose from the dead, shedding your blood as a Sacrifice for my sins.  I turn to You as the only way of salvation, I submit my life to you, I submit my will to yours, I place my Faith and Trust in You alone as Lord of my life, Please save me and I thank You for it, in Jesus holy name, Amen.”    If you have truly placed your faith in Jesus Christ as your Lord, submitting your life to Him, you can know that you are a child of God and on your way to heaven.  Now that you are on your way to heaven, you should attend a bible believing church and follow in baptism...
They basically said they're both heartless Hookers. THEY'RE for the streets.

Timbaland killed this beat!
Sad that half asians are now the representation for black women
Saweetie is so pretty but these hair looks tho 👀
Hey all, i just started listening to saweetie (starting w/this song) and im not to sure on what seems to appeal to you guys so much to like this. From a music side, there's no variation with just 4 major chords on a piano the ENTIRE song with another vocalist to repeat tye end chorus. From the lyrics side, again no variation minus the backup at the end. All topped off with the same 808 track we've listened to for the past 3 years.
Its giving pretty much doja cat 💁🏻‍♀️
Her hair looks like Cotton Candy. Why?!
I dig it
I love this song so much😭😍
I love me some jhene
💘💘💘💘
saweetie and jhene are angels on earth
RE-FUCKIN-PEAT
Oh damn I came here from among us

She and jhene aiko are super pretty, talented, clean, and stylish...  They both have pretty faces! God the glory
On repeat, and you know that’s right! 😍🔥🔥🔥🔥

Jhene clearly got more of the Asian genes and Saweetie got more of the African genes. both stunning in their own way, amazing how genetics work.
Jhene ALWAYS make me feel and give me chills.

“Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry.” ‭‭Colossians‬ ‭3:5‬ ‭  🙏🏽🕊 Lord, May those that need this..see this 🙏🏽🕊
Sounds nice, but no man of quality should want a lady like this. If this sounds empowering you're damaged...

Biblical implications about vaccine and Christian doctors have confirmed. See Revelation 18 and do research. Pray for wisdom and He will give it freely. Contains man made enzyme called LUCIFERASE. God's people die from lack of knowledge.

@candice mason it said in the article that the african american hollywood celebrities use a japanese skin lightening and bleaching lotion that makes them look from black to mixed race light skinned but they deny it https://matsuiskinlightening.com/products/bleaching-skin-lightening-orange-peeling-lotion-100-ml-top-selling-product  i guess they want people to think they are naturally light skinned thats why they deny lightening their skin thats the only reason i can think of.
Ok Icy gang wya. This video is so aesthetically pleasing. Like that she had a female director too. Females don't get enough love in that aspect of the industry. Saweetie and Jhene's voice blend so well. My fav song from her.

for those Eastern Star members who may still be unconvinced about the paganism in their organization perhaps this chapter will be enlightening to them Rob Morris founder of the Eastern Star posted up its Origins about the first of February 1850 I was laid up for 2 weeks with a sharp attack of of rheumatism arthritis when was this. Which I gave to the work in Hand by the aid of my papers in the memory of Miss Morris I will call Ethan to trivial occurrence is connected with the work how I hesitated for a theme how I die lead over a name how I rocked face-to-face with a clock that I might keep my drama within the limits of time the name was first settled upon the Eastern star next to number of points 5, to correspond with the emblem on the Masters Carpet this is the Pentagon the Signet of King Solomon and eminently proper to adoptive masonry the colors 2 emblems emblems, the floral wreaths that Esther be proper to these 5 hero liens or easy of invention they seem to fall already made into my hands the only piece boat mechanism difficult to fit into the construction was the cannibalistic model but this occurred to me in ample time for use the sections were j e p t j e p h t h a h apostrophe s daughter illustrate respect to the blinding force of a vowel v o w Ruth illustrating Devotion to religious principles Esther illustrating Fidelity to Kindred and Friends Martha illustrating undeviating faith in the hour of trial Electra Illustrated patients and submissions under wrong these are Masonic virtues they have now we're in history more.

If you are reading this I just want to say that you are so talented , blessed , and worth it. God is going to do something. Say this prayer,Father for all these blessings you have blessed us with. We are so thankful for all you have done. Please bless everyone and for everyone to be safe and saved. We are thankful to still have you lord and thank you so much for sending your son to die on the cross and save us from sins. Thank you for forgiveness. In Jesus name we have prayed , amen. And if your not already saved say “father God I acciept you as my Lord and Savior” and turn away from all your sins and start to read your Bible ! Have a blessed day
🙏🏾
Yes ♥️...☮️💲♥️
For anyone scrolling through the comments going through a really hard time I truly hope things get better for you no matter who you are. Please don't give up trying. There is a reason you are here reading this message, to remind you that YOU are so important to God and His Son Jesus Christ. I can only imagine what you are going through but God knows.  I also know how difficult life can be and I may not understand your exact experience but I am truly sorry that things have been so tough for you. I care and want you to know that you are not alone, you have a purpose, you are worthy of so much. Please take it one day at a time, one step at a time.  I am praying that God will send His angels to each and everyone of you to comfort you, surround you with His love, give you peace beyond measure, and to change things for the better.  Please know that you are here for a reason and that sometimes we don't always know why we go through things, maybe to help someone else going through the same thing because you understand such pain that someone else may not.   Please also know you also have a Savior Jesus Christ who died for you, He loves you more than you could ever know. Please ask Him for forgiveness of wrongs and ask Him into your heart believing with sincerity. ( Please see the book the Holy Bible for more information) He can guide you in all things. I speak from experience it doesn't matter what we have done or that we think we don't measure up He will meet us where we are, even in our lowest low. He can give you peace beyond measure, I speak from experience. I can only imagine how hard it has been for you but I truly hope the best is yet to come for all of you. Please never give up, because He won't give up on us. Please remember this when things are hard and you feel at the end of your rope.  To give your life to Jesus Christ here is a sample prayer: Dear Lord Father in Heaven I admit I am a sinner. I have done many things that don't please you. I have lived my life for myself only. I am sorry and I repent. I ask you to forgive me.  I believe that you died for me to save me. You did what I could not do for myself. I come to you now and ask you to take control of my life; I give it to you. From this day forward, help me to live every day for you in a way that pleases you. I love you Lord, and I thank you that I will spend eternity with you, In Jesus name I pray, amen

To all the people who dislike the video🌚🤚🏾
Yes saweetie!!! This is what we all needed
THE VISUALS😍😍😍🔥
She is not the next Nicki or Cardi. She is in her own lane
AT 0:20 Theres a mysterious piece of  square paper where she got up from that wasnt there when she got up -its not there when she rises to go to the door but then at 0:20 the square paper is there on the floor
The video made no sense.
This the type of song you play when you feeling yourself, right after you finish getting cute, staring a yourself in a mirror singing the lyrics😋
yasss girl
The way I love this song and music video
We have all sinned & fallen short to the glory of God. We have all broken God’s commandments, therefore we deserve hell , we deserve eternal punishment in hell bc of our sins. But bc God is love & merciful He offered a way for sinners to be saved from the eternal punishment we deserve. He died on the cross for the punishment that we deserve so that we can be free from hell. & what we have to do is repent of our sins & turn away from all sin & put faith & trust in the only one who can save us from hell which is Jesus. Will you accept Him in your heart? He’s our Lord & Savior! He changed my life! I’m so much better now I find peace with Him. Without Him Idk where I would be. Salvation is a gift from God we are saved by WE ARE SAVED BY GRACE ALONE FAITH ALONE!❤️❤️❤️❤️ Also be careful what you feed your spirit, feed it the word of God! :)
everything about this video was beautiful.
who is the man at 1:50 😳
I’m so in love with this 💙💙💙💙 BOMB af

The vibes from the video are immaculate ✨✨✨❤️❤️❤️
This song an video a whole VYBEEEEE
Only here because Jhené !!!
Hey 💜I hope you’re having a great day.  Hopefully this comment gives you hope. The state of the world is alarming. Many people feel uneasy about everything that’s going on. The root of every single problem is evil aka sin. Any of us could die any second but where would we go after? Well, because of our sin and evil ways, we deserve to go to hell. The Bible states in Romans 6:23 “For the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” BUT WAIT! I have some good news for you. God has offered us a chance to go to heaven and have everlasting life by sending his only Son Jesus Christ into the world to die on the cross for our sins. John 3:16 says “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” That was a true display of love. Repent and Surrender your life to Christ today before it’s too late.
💕💕💕

💜it
It's worth jerking off too but hardly original I don't feel like I gained anything from listening to this mentally I didn't feel like I grew as an individual with the slightest bit of understanding of my own problems if this is music and supposed to be art there is nothing significant or meaningful or symbolic I can grasp from it. it is literally just a dime a dozen basic white chick music that people will swear by an say  that it's fire
Here is a new electronic chill song. Turn on 🎧https://youtu.be/idZxkhFncVk
The best video's just finish to quick 😣😣
why this sound exactly like meg’s lol
Jesus is the way the truth and the life. God sent his only begotten Son so that you can have everlasting life. Place your faith in Jesus. Trust Jesus. Jesus Christ. Jesus saves. Jesus conqueres. Calvary Cross. The Blood. Salvation. Gospel. Heaven or hell. Kingdom.    God bless you

I really wish girls would stop making music and just make it all about sex appeal. It’s really annoying as hell seeing yet another artist in some all pink, half naked, zoomin in on her body. Like seriously man just no originality here it’s just girls with money talking about hoe shit half naked 😹. We’re better than this you guys.

Ok but saweetie snapped with the looks 🤧

*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” *www.soul.fish*

This has nothing to do with the video...But I want to WARN you all in 💝. Please everyone choose Jesus as your Lord and Savior. All these natural disasters are lining up with Bible prophecy in Rev. We are getting closer to Jesus's return and judgement coming on the entire world. Please all repent with your mouth to God and admit we need a Savior Jesus Christ who died for all our sins. Believe and have faith in Jesus Christ and how he died on the cross for our sins and rose again. Invite the Holy Spirit ( being baptized ) into your life and turn from your sins. For those who don't repent and choose Jesus's gift of dying on the cross so we can have eternal life.. Things won't go well for them. I don't want to see anyone perish. I love you all, why I'm warning everyone daily and praying for the entire 🌎 daily. God bless you all!! I'm a sinner and I'm so grateful Jesus saved me from perishing. I keep seeking him daily and his commandments and they aren't burdensome, instead I have peace even when the world seems to be falling apart. God is on the throne, amen!!🙏💐😊💝
She say she put Quavo on a leash!!!
Congrats love 😎🌌
HOPE ❤️, Salvation is found in no one else, no other name under heaven given among men where by we must be saved. Saved from the punishment of sin. I’m trying to offer people Hope in absolute perfection !!! No more dying, lies, decay, depression, anxiety, crying, sickness, rotten food, broken things , etc... offering the Hope of Eternity in heaven with Jesus Christ. We must be willing to turn from sin to receive Jesus forgiveness. And to know and live out his teachings. He who does the will of God abides for eternity 1 John 2:17 📖nkjv ✝️ 🚴🏿
Saweetie or Megan Thee Stallion, that is the question...
I LOVE THE 80s VIBE THAT SHE BE BRINGING LOVE IT❤❤❤❤

It’s a vibe..
I see Aiko, I click
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he conquered death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117742/ref=emc_b_5_mob_i

Kevin Samuels checked you on the Birken bag comment. You're giving women false hope of finding a man that's a top 3% earner. BIRKEN DOESN'T EVEN SELL TO JUST ANYONE, THEY DON'T CARE IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY. 😂😂😂😂 https://youtu.be/QiaV8XM_sug

https://youtu.be/4tlmZJnsRNA
🖤Can we please just take a moment, a real moment to just truly appreciate how everyone has grown in music in 2020. This music video is so un-Saweetie but that's only because we've been seeing her grow as an artist and as a person & it's reflected in her videos but now she I feel she has had a lot of time, like the rest of us, to vision who she truly is & how she perceives her art.🌹When I saw these looks, vibes & energy I just realized how important it is to her. I wish you all the best💜💙
Yeauh...this a hit

💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
🌅 His wisdom is profound, his power is vast. Who has resisted him and come out unscathed?  He moves mountains without their knowing it and overturns them in his anger.  He shakes the earth from its place and makes its pillars tremble.  He speaks to the sun and it does not shine; he seals off the light of the stars.  He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.  He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.  He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.  When he passes me, I cannot see him; when he goes by, I cannot perceive him.  If he snatches away, who can stop him? Who can say to him, ‘What are you doing?’  God does not restrain his anger; even the cohorts of Rahab cowered at his feet.  “How then can I dispute with him? How can I find words to argue with him?  Though I were innocent, I could not answer him; I could only plead with my Judge for mercy.  Even if I summoned him and he responded, I do not believe he would give me a hearing.  He would crush me with a storm and multiply my wounds for no reason.  He would not let me catch my breath but would overwhelm me with misery.  If it is a matter of strength, he is mighty! And if it is a matter of justice, who can challenge him ?  Even if I were innocent, my mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, it would pronounce me guilty. Job 9:4‭-‬20 NIV https://bible.com/bible/111/job.9.4-20.NIV 🙏
This video is just so feminine and beautiful!  Such a great collab.

Megan album was so mediocre I'm here wandering YouTube streets searching for creativity and artistry. Thank you Saweetie!
YES GIRL
Amazing!!  by using the same wore out, waaaay over used pop music formula combined with some T&A and sprinkled with mindless adolescent babbling from a Saweetie that narrowly avoided a future with a stripper pole and a lot of mattress time has gotten simple-minded people to make her rich.

Jesus said "So it will be at the end of the age, the angels will come forth and take out the wicked from among the righteous, and will throw them into the furnace of fire, in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth." Matthew 13:49-50. Jesus also said "You are my friends if you do what I command you." John 15:14. Jesus taught that the only way to be saved is to choose him as your Lord and Master, repent and believe that he died for the sins of his people on the cross see John 14:6.

Acts 2:38 (KJV)  Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Acts 5:32 (KJV)  And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him. Hebrews 5:9 (KJV)  And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him; Proverbs 28:13 (KJV)  He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy, Hebrews 12:14 (KJV)  Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord'.

For YouTube  JESUS IS COMING  & HE LOVES YOU  Believe the Gospel and Repent ⬇️⬇️⬇️  “Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:” ‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭15:1-4‬ ‭KJV‬‬  The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Peter 3:9 | KJV  REPENT: feel or express sincere regret or remorse about one's sin  This World is so Sad I just want anyone reading this know that their LOVED so much by  ...  God he gave his only begotten son for you he loves your smile,your Hair,your sweet gestures,your eyes,your the main thing he wants His Arms are always open waiting for you to come home but most keep running away   It’s tearing him apart inside knowing he LOVES us all so much but most don’t love him  some even hate and blame him for all the wickedness in the world even though Humans have Free Will they kill,hate,destroy  REPENT and Accept Jesus today
Stay in dis kind of music plssss... This is ur track!

It is amazing, two one of the best singers together
STUNNING
I love how aesthetically pleasing this video is like goddamn I cant take this much goodness I'm going to die. Also when she shows her buzz cut is amazing I could never have that much confidents to buzz cut/ pixie cut my hair. Overall this music video is something to beat. Some people might not agree with me but with Jhené Aiko's vocals and Saweetie's makes this music/single something really special and I will enjoy every moment of. I especially love the E.T moment when they rode their bicycles into the sky. The lilies with Jhené Aiko makes it just seem so special. So than you both Saweetie and Jhené  Aiko if this masterpiece (I am very sorry if this was hard to read).
Saweetie should be a r&b singer instead she sounds so much better
Song is 🔥
meu deus, q clipe perfeito  😳😳😳😳
Dis sh!t fye🔥🔥🔥
Jhene makes my heart stop. She's UNREAL. Such a beaut.
😍
“Consider yourself blessed, you got to fuk with the baddest” 💅🏼💅🏼💅🏼
The video made me like the song.
Sawetttieeeeeee
Yo, I wanna know who was part of the hair, fashion and production design team because wow. 🤩

Just realised that Saweetie is the second hit maker amongst the new female rappers outside Cardi. She effortlessly releases hits without too much hype. That can't be said for the others
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

So saweetie trying to put out her icey winter because hot girl Meg dropped 😭😭
For what i received i passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the scriptures  1 Corinthians 15 3   PS: "according to the Scriptures" - what the Apostle means is that Lord Jesus fulfilled prophecy's of the Prophets of God in Old Testament. There are like hundreds of Prophecies that Lord Jesus fulfilled, just look it up bruhs and gurls. God is our Father. He is the best of Fathers, the most lovable and merciful of fathers. Read the whole uncensored Bible that is Catholic(The Original) and  pray my friends. Wish you all well🙏amen🙏

PERIODTTT
Love the black and Asian representation 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
It was the visuals for me! 😍
I been waiting on the video 😭😭
I dont understand the concept of this video lmfao
Doja cat come get yo sister with the say so wig💅🏾💅🏾💅🏾😻
Isn't it funny her & Aiko want to push the Bl-Asian (Black-Asian) narrative in this video, but aren't they two of the women on the "My Type (remix)" that talk about 'BBC,' 'rich n¡ggas' & '8inches,' being their 'type.' You can't stereotype one race of people & then try to be inclusive on the your next hit feature. This is why the six-letter-R-word persists in America. There's zero consistency when it comes to checking it in all it's subtle forms.
think swaeetie should do more of these song fit her voice  love the video too...🔥❄️🔥
This was bomb 💣
Am here for Jhene Aiko    💋💋💋💋💋

Oh honey, this a whole Bop!
Imagine If Doja was on this too
Sorry Saweetie stans, that J.I. Jane cotton candy hair looks tore up. Chile, PLEASE, stay in the wig shoppe.  Had to comment again because apparently censorship of controversial opinions is a thing in 2020.
Asian Male Love Interest 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽

I love how Jhene completely goes in on her ex's in songs and then is like "oh and btw I wish you luck", just to send the good vibes after she's vented

“ IKTRANMFW “
Death, it's one of the biggest events that will ever take place in your life. We face death everyday, conscious or unconsciously of it; death lurks around every corner of our life. Like a lion waiting to catch its prey, death comes for us all in many shapes and form; seemingly there is no one who can escape from the jaws of death. But did you know there is a reason why we die? The idea of death you're familiar with is only the tip of the iceberg. See we die because we've sinned against God. Death according to the bible is wages " for the wages of sin is death " (Romans 6:23). Because man sinned against God, we live in a fallen world, it was once perfect, but now in ruins. Now that sin exists, God is coming to judge the world In righteousness. It's appointed a man once to die and after this judgement" (Hebrews 9:27) The standard he'll judge you by is the 10 commandments, God's moral law. He's so serious about sin that he gave anyone who sins the death sentence, the bible says you've earned it through sinning against God and each time you sin you build up his wrath. “The soul who sins shall die.” (Ezekiel 18:4) The punishment is the eternal fires of Hell " Where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth" (Matthew 13:42) You will have to face God on Judgement Day.  Will you go to Heaven or Hell? Here’s a quick test: 1-You shall have no other gods before me. 2-You shall not make any idols. 3-You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain. 4-Remember the Sabbath Day. 5-Honor your father and mother. 6-You shall not murder. 7-You shall not commit adultery. 8-You shall not steal. 9-You shall not lie. 10-You shall not covet.   Have you ever told a lie? stolen anything? used God’s name in vain? have you ever looked at anyone with lust? He sees lust as adultery, “Whoever looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart.”(Matthew 5:28) Have you ever hated someone? he sees hatred as murder, ”Anyone who hates another brother or sister is a murderer, (1 John 3:15)   James 2:10 says, “the person who keeps all of the laws except one is as guilty as a person who has broken all of God’s laws.”   Don't rely on your own goodness or good works to save you. That's like bribing God to let you into heaven;  Nor a church, pastor, priest, or any religion. None of us are good at all, even murderers, rapists, even Hilter will call themselves Good and they'll try to justify themselves by their Good works. But the bible says: • "But we are all like an unclean thing, and all of our righteousnesses are like filthy rags; we fade as a leaf, and our iniquities, like wind have taken us away." (Isaiah 64:6) God's definition of good is morally excellent and therefore he demands absolute pperfections. No one can ever match his standards. That's why Jesus said: • " No one is good except God alone." (Luke 18:19) If you have done any of those things, God sees you as guilty of breaking His law and the Bible warns that the guilty will end up in Hell. Will YOU be guilty on Judgement Day?   "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 6:23)  God sent His Son to suffer and die on the cross. Jesus took the punishment upon Himself and defeated death on the cross; not because your Good but because God is rich in mercy.  “For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.” (John 3:16) Jesus rose from the dead and defeated death. Repent (turn from sin) today and trust in Jesus and God will grant you everlasting life; you'll also be born again.  He'll give you a new heart that desires righteousness, what is just and a heart that will love God.  that is why Jesus said "Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." (John 3:3)  Then, Read the Bible and obey what you read.  ☆ When Are You Going To Get Right With God? “Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion“ (Hebrews 3:15) “Now is the accepted time, behold  now is the day of salvation.” (2 Corinthians 6:2) • " Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved." (Acts 4:12) It's your choice. I'll leave you with this "What shall profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? " (Mark 8:36) If you're taking this seriously, Would you like a prayer? This prayer is not a guarantee that you'll be saved, that's between you and God. However, I'd like this to be a good start for your journey. "Father, I thank you for this person's open heart and ask that he/she would repent and trust alone in Jesus christ. I also ask that you guide their steps on their journey so that they would pass from death to life. In Jesus name amen.
