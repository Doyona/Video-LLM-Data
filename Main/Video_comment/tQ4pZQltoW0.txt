WOOOOOw!
verry Good
Bro your title says 300Mph which equates to 482Kmh... can you get to Tree fiddy?
Never in my life did I ever think I would see 500kph on the speedometer of a road registerable car...
My bike  was restricted to 300kph.
Title correction:  Mat was a passenger princess
german: WE HAVE VAYS OF DEALING WITH YOU, MR WATSON
300kph, not mph  Idk if he was trying to be misleading or somehow managed to mix them up.
😡
Acceleration on 5:05
Why it looks super clean?
Finally the v16 is come But i never forgot the chiron
WTAF is the point of "limiting" it to 275 mph?  Is that last 25 mph really that much more dangerous than doing nearly 4 times the UK speed limit?  Apart from anything else, of course, there are VERY few people in the world who are capable of driving even remotely competently at half that speed on the public road.  I  have always considered myself a petrolhead, but hypercars are just getting stupid now, vasty more power and speed than will ever be used by 99.999% of owners.
5:55 I like the sound of it accelerating.
Phenomenal piece of engineering. Groundbreaking infact. But... gotta say.. prefer the looks of Lambos! haha
like the dude but what a clickbait
Its 300kph not mph
Lol that cheap shitbox cant go faster than my golf 2. And thats without shifting to anything higher than 1st gear.
Ugly interior for 3.5 million
Good nicee😮
So now we have proof of it being in production and two different cars going over 300 mph it's official fastest car in the world for like over 4 years.
Are there grass pot’s behind their heads?  lol
3:58 "2.0l 4 cylinder" It's a 2.0l 4 cylinder 4 times, with 4 turbos.
That car is a rocket
Every supercar does 300kmh. Lets see them do 300MPH.
What happed to 300 mph ripped off with kms?
"It's like a Tesla for the first second, and then it keeps pulling"... best statement ever 😀
0-50km/h 7sec
Mat acting like the Rimac and Koenigsegg Regera don't exist smh
300mph in the title...yeah who are you kidding...great way to get a clickbait
No the fastest car is the thrust SSC
The fastest car in the world has regular doors  By the way the engineers elderly a robot. Not really a fun person to talk to
Super click bait title lol
Now let's see Paul Allen's buggati
i like this car..im from malaysia...kelantan
One of the car own by Tungku Mahkota Johor , Sultan Johor , Malaysia Prince ,
No
Bro bro we’re lost use your car’s gps after all it’s very very expensive it should have top class gps
The pinnacle of the combustion engine.
not the super sport 300+ has orange stripes @carwow
Its funny how Germans have zero sense of humor 😂 thats why they make the best cars in the world!
How is the fuel economy on this car because Petrol is expensive is here
the meanest hardcore auto that evertufned petrol into horsepower
Best car In the world
If you don’t like Bugatti you have very very small balls in fact they are raisins if you don’t like Bugatti f jdm the Bugattis stock people oate so Brian dead if you don’t like this car what an ding master peace.
I'm here
If only you could take that and 300+ for a drag race, like your regular videos
No helmets or racing belts but i guess at 300 miles an hour it dont matter...
What A Way To Lose Your Bugarginity
This might be the best car to take on the 'Big Lap' in Australia.
I'm guessing most went to the Middle East & Russia/China
This is outstanding. This is not a car. This is a rocketship that can fly amongst the Cosmos!!
Rip trust SST
Oh my GODDDDDDDD🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
What’s with the slavemasks?
I can't be the only one who is smiling at Matt's happiness of being the first journalist in the Bugatti😭
The door window falls down 0.15 seconds into the film. The quality of this car is very poor!! And then hope that with a speed of 300 it only stays with a broken window. Otherwise RIP new owner... 🧟‍♂️
That is km/h
Yeah lol it was the fastest car ever!
Don't care about the car. Look at those stupid masks
300 KM/H nobody corrected that "tiny detail"??? (yes this car is capable of 300+ mp/h, yet here it "only" does 300 km/h)
this is 300kmh no 300mph
we will drive upto 500 kph
nice car
The title is a bit incorrect, you did 300 kmph and not mph.
We have all sinned and fallen short of Gods glory and we all deserve hell but Jesus Christ Gods perfect sent son died on a cross so we don’t have to go there and we can now be saved by grace through our faith in him.
Bugatti car be like I'm the only big and bad boyee . 😀😀😀😀
300 mph or kmh
Konegseg jesko is faster
Bugatti engineer's mind: dude shut up  Matt: I'm gonna keep talking
120 kmh in first gear 😨
Good thing but that's 300 km/h not mph
It reaches the takeoff rotation speed of a jet airliner in only 7 seconds. That's insane technology.
Clickbait it's km/h
Seeing this I'm glad that the jdm fanboys mad
Mat is the most funniest thing B.U.G.G.A.T.I.
That car is the price of my house lmfaooo that's crazy.
That's super fast buggati choron super sport 300 plus great
Can somebody explain why he thinks that it's the fastest production car ever? It's not even 2nd,SSC TauTara is by far the fastest Confused
Matt: How fast is the Bugatti Chrion actually  The Bugatti engineer: Yes
The tital of the video is very clever. Feels like click bait but isn't. I thought they will take it to 300 mph.
Class  Class
Why do i feel like the guy hates matt, or is it just a german thing
Get in a Koenigsegg now mat
The title said 300 mp/h, the speedometer said 300 km/h.  Nice but not nearly as impressive!
What's 500km/h?
Lol 5:08 second gear at 96km/h, what the hell man!
Its 300 kmph not mph...
He say he make a 300 mph+ test but it was only 300 km/h......
Wow so cool
Watt
pls go in the 500 mph
Driving at 300mph = Safe Not wearing a mask = not safe.  The world's gone mad.
Incredible 🤯 Just the First Gear climbs upto almost 60kmph 🤯
thats 300 KM/H NOT MPH
It has a 500km/h speedo 🤦‍♂ lord have mercy... 😂😂
Well, you are not.
300 kph not mph
holy shit
Funny that its 300 kmh and not 300 mph👀
Every other car will seem slow   Jesko:  :)))
Am I missing something? He didn't go 300mph? He did 303 kph. So the title is a mistake?
i thought they put pot plants in the engine bay by the rear window
kmh
ALL BUGATTI should do 300. Mph
Should say 300KPH. Not MPH
Imagine this on the autobahn
I’ve drove one not that impressive
that car goes faster than me subscribing to your channel  so fast
Look at the engine in the start hmm sus 🤨
It's 300 kmh not mph
You could literally feel his joy through the screen
title of video says 300mph car dashboard says 300kmh ....
i think you forgot to include how much you can save through carwow on the car 😂
So by 300 mph you mean 300 kph right?
300 km/h not mph
title: 300 mph reality: 300 kmh
this german guy (i guess), talks like a robot.
You live in Italy 🇮🇹
They went 300 KM, not 300 MPH.
Э бля 300 км в час он ехал, спидометр и борт компьютер показывает не в милях
That is young me
i wanna see the part where he goes 300 miles per hour :)) sick title lol
I've never seen Mat so giddy with excitement!
Can you do this every day without an engine rebuild ? Or will it explode after 7 pulls?
KPH?
it does 300 so quickly man
But Hello! - Its 300km/h  NOT  300mph - Big different! (look at speedometer)
What are the supercars in carwow to buy for a fair price?
Dude driving is sounds like Dan Akroyd in Coneheads
Once you go that fast I bet 160 feels extremely slow
Fab car and video. The title says 300mph but it's actually 300kmph?
what i think why bugatti limited the top speed of the chiron super sport is maybe cuz some owners will go too fast and do crazy stuff in it welp it's their car so who i'm i to tell them what to do with their car they spent money on 😂
can we drive on water ?
So is it 300 MPH or KPH? Titles says mph but the speedos in Kph?
What a good car it is. I cant believe what a power
Just so everyone knows, this is NOT the fastest car in the world. It never did the run in both directions. Only 1 direction which was with the wind.
:O
That's the beautiful thing about Bugatti it builds its speed effortlessly.
Man if you do this in switzerland  and police  checke how much kilomètres  you do i think you will go to prison  for your life . 🥲
Can't wait till he tries a Tesla roadster ☞￣ᴥ￣☞
video says 300mph but the car speedo meter says 300kmh
He never been in any Bugatti?  And the F1 vs chiron race video?
its 300kph not mph matt
How effortless !
It's 300kph not mph. Nice click bait
The  Bugatti chiron is the  fastest car in the world 😁😁
KM/H**
That's so awesome. But why would two perfectly healthy people wear masks in a car like that? It literally makes no sense whatsoever. Where's the threat?
300 kmh is what 180 mph no whoop
Fun fact it is shown in 300 km
300mph ???? 300kph you went which is 186.4mph so your 113.6mph away mmmm.
Don't whisper ........then laugh.....we can hear what you are saying
You have to try Koenigsegg Jesko ..
No question it's fast, but this was 300kph top speed, which is less than 190mph. I'll take a superbike over this even though this is cool. Same rush to 300kph, if not slightly faster and for 3.5 million less. Lot of extra cash to go 75mph faster assuming you can do it at all. Cool to keep edging up records though. :)
That flat paint job is horrid, it reminds me of the yobo crowd in the cheap wraps on the Civics & Nissans, or my grandpa's farm tractor that we sprayed with the $5 can of rust paint.
Soulja Boy was first
Free promotion for Bugatti and they will not even let him drive a little bit?
mph it's not a KM Per Hour mate
The description says 300mph but it's actually 300kmph which are two VERY different things 😭☹️
Ah good. You can drive 300 mph right on over to the shop for a $100k repair
Jesko absolut might go 330 mph
Kmh not mph!
Unless I miss something 303 km is just 188 mph I have been 160 mph in a chevrolet caprice police package $4000 and what is impressive about the Bugatti other than 9.6 in a quarter still don't see it
8:52 😱😱😱😱😱🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
His laugh said it all! ❤🔥🔥🔥
Bruh
Koeeninsage is better
300km/h not 300mph/h
Who is this car owner
The German is always serious 😂
Stupid clickbait. The driver clearly says: 300 KILOMETRES per hour. The speed display shows 300 KILOMETRES per hour.. Yet the title says MILES per hour.
For a second I thought it was in mph. He hit 300 and I was shocked, then I read km/h lmaooo
i like how he opens the door and went inside the car like it's his car
I bet the Tesla Model S Plaid is faster and for $3 million, you can buy 23 MSP cars. It’s not even exciting watching these gasoline super cars anymore
I absolutely love Bugatti💫
a porsche macan shift stick
umm. no. you weren't the first.
WHY DOES THIS SAY MPH
300 km\h not mph\h😊
2:41 I thought I saw flowerpots with plants in the back window, till he said he was collecting data.
Wait it said km/h
Manny should’ve gotten one
isn't this 300 km/h rather than 300 mph?(the caption)
I won't watch any video with people wearing fabric masks... https://aapsonline.org/mask-facts/
Why none allow you to drive their Bugattis ?  Remember the F1 video yesterday ? 😶
I mean you lied you went 300km/hr not 300mph
We need drag  race  of porsche turbo 911 s Vs this Bugatti
All the people in the background together talking yet when you get in the car you put face muzzles on, docking sell outs shame on you selling out your kids to this scam.
Could use the Rimac as a dolly 😂
Good thing the Rimac wasn’t around….
Just suppose if itz tire got burst over the top speed😑
The original has a longer tail Its not the original one 😏😏😏
that is so fast OMG I really want to drive it
isnt it
A waste of money, Tesla  cost $130 less, faster and better  technology, these cars are done like the dinosaur 🦕
What a thumbnail 300mpu
VRAU.bugatty
6:04 he sounds like ken miles from ford vs Ferrari 😅
300mph is much more impressive than 300km which you actually did.
KMPH not MPH :)
So that was a fucking lie.
When you dont have enogh balls to reach 500kmh
Tuatara
Very not cool
are those plants in the rearview? I know they aren't, but they sure look like it!
There,s many things everybody should be allowed to experience but our society is hell bent on hierarchy and unfairness ,like one man getting the equivalence of 50 million dollars for 2700 years for making other people deliver goods his firm didn’t even make....which sounds like the modern definition of slavery,all that in our for the people democratic society.....
And then comes Rimac 😎
change the title to kmh
Bugatti should really try and break the record with this.
But it's shows in km/hr
bruhh its 300 kmh not mph
Crushed by Tesla
This German engineers reactions are so dry — it cracks me up...so funny, love it! Great guy!!
its 300kmh not mph, change your tittle dummy
The cool starter suprisingly beg because need particularly nest outside a slow pendulum. abnormal, alleged love
It’s 300km/h not 300mph
Tom Kristensen going down the mulsanne straight at 220 mph suddenly gets flashed and tooted from behind by Matt munching on a cheese burger and drinking coffee. lol
that engineer sounds and acts like a cyborg hahah
Nevera e basta...
I feel like bugattis are more stable at higher speeds than koenigseggs, I may be wrong though.
Well that driver is a bundle of charisma
KPH not MPH…..
Is 300 km or 300 miles?... Bcz u are sayin it is 300 miles in the title but on the speedometer it is sayin km??
Matt's screaming like the car made him wet😂
It's 300 km/h not mp/h
first to go to 300 km/h you mean
Matt ws experiencing 300 Gs 😂😂😂
..and also, if Matt's the first motor Journalist in this car, SuperCarBlondie must be pi**ed. LOL.
so beautiful and expensive is the Bugatti Chiron SS that the "Stick of Truth" has no place here.
Hello!  You forget to insert stick in the exhaust
Wearing face nappies? Fucking tragic.
So you buy a car that can do 300mph.......only it can't. What a waste of time! I guess there is always a way to kill the limiter.
Now... Try Koenigsegg
umm fastest car ever. Thats a lie the ssc tuatara is the fastest car in the world. Mat Watson stop the cap
this car is faster to get to 300mph than I'm to get to 60mph with my Yaris !
its 300 "km/h" lol
german engineering, french designing
What really blows me away is the fact that the 1st gear takes it straight to 100 kmh.... Like WTF 😎🤏🕶️🤨
Mat asks question like a enthusiastic son ask from dad lol 😅
5:11 kira laugh!
only a Terminator sounds more German than that engineer
0-100 kph in 4 sec
He sound like the cone head aliens
is it me or are there 2 pots of plants in the trunk?
You a money
Man where are you going to run 300 mph ?
If crash happened,insurance companies will cover it damage.
What is the point of a Buggati Chiron super sport if it has a speed limit isn’t it supposed to be the 300 mile Chiron
Yah looks like a Normal Buggati Chiron not the 300 mile Buggati Chiron
The model s plaid plus is faster acceleration
5:27 When Mat said that, I already got goosebumps, this experience must be like no others.
smth is wrong
300   km/h not mp/h
Its kmhr
The child coming out of him is hilarious 🤣
yo
It's 300 kmph not mph.
“ How many mpg”  “No”
Mat, the 1000hp Supra that you drove was faster than this I think.. your skin was literally tearing itself apart from your body haha
not mph i meant kilometers
thats not the fastest car in the worl the fastest super car in the worlsis the konigseg agera rs super plus and the buggati chrion was going 400 mph but the konigesg passd the trash car in 430 mph bye bye buggati fans sweden fore life
Its 300KMPH NOT 300MPH
What's in the back windows? Looks like a potted plant at 3mins in... https://youtu.be/tQ4pZQltoW0?t=180
Where does bugatti test the max speed
in the us the speed limit is like 70 miles an hour on the highway, there the speed limit is 186mph
What are those? Geraniums in the rear windows?
that engineer ruins the video for me
300kmph not mph liar
People: Money can't buy hapiness  Money: 5:12
Its 300kmh not mph
Are you ready? 5:03
I mean he did drive a car 300km/h so I don't know why is he SO excited
I usually watch you but I had to comment on this. Great video, you reminded me of the first time I drove a manual car on track. I was 16 and I drove an Audi r8 v10 ❤️. There's nothing like your first time
Buen video!!!!
This is the first ever carwow Video I have ever seen
The driver act like El😂😂😂😂lon musk
If that goes 300 mph Mat would be screaming 1 hour that's loud hearing in the other car
To the batmobile Robin!
literally an overpriced volkswagen. You even get a key with a bugatti symbol on it, but its the same key a jetta uses.
Wow I’m glad I’m not a subscriber this guy is annoying !!!!
Mat: I am the first to go in the Bugatti Chiron Super Sport Test drivers: *well yes but actually no*
This Chiron, should I shortlist it or buy it right away ?
Two boxes of guitar cords and effects pedals sitting on the engine.
Mph. Mph on tac wouldn’t say 400
Not fan  of  bugattis
He has the best job in the world
What a Engineer 😂 Y E S
put it up against Porsche 911 turbo s
why didnt you do the carwow stick test on the vents lol
So fast WOW
Did u know that 25 August is my birthday
Why do german speaking people (I too am one) always have to have this horrific accent? Pls just start talking english for the love of god
Why dose this guy have to act like a absolute fucking Bellend in every video he’s in.?
"I think you should go ahead and buy it"
no fucking mask😡😡😡😡
Koenigsegg are waiting for you
Dude is doing 300kmh pulls and people are complaining about how he is like e robot. Have you ever done past 200?
Heading says 300 mph you were doing 300 km thats a huge difference unless it was a click bait mistake ?????
Whoah, THATS THE DRONE(, DUCKING AWAY) mat, you are a legend
Batman wants his car back
Fastest production car .
Can I go for a test drive?
Yay now we have finally found a car faster than the 911 turbo s and 918 spider
Lool this is work for u and me 🤣🤣
DOLANDIRICI 300MPH isnt 300km/h idiots army
Big lie with the title though! 186mph isn’t 300mph is it???? 🙄
He speaks like Niki Lauda.
It looks like there are some pot plants in the windows behind them
Its not mph it is kmph
These day it isn't the fastest in the world, because the fastest is ssc tautara. Hitting 560kph
Only obvious you would daily drive a model s p90dl now mark...
How would that be like against an F1 car?
Ugly car
Amazing
If I'm paying almost 4 million US for a car that can do 300mph I want 300mph not 275
X2 flux capacitor’s in the rear window on display
Matt is so rough and careless with cars... I'd never let him in something I cared about lol.
I could like Matt if he wasn't such a bellend 😁 Still, great channel and lots of fun videos. And yes, bit jealous that this guy gets to lark about like this for a living.
Awesome 🤩👌
Umm where was the 300mph 🤔 all I saw was 300kph
im wondering, how much i could save if i use "help me carwow" in this bugatti. 😂😅
Way to be cool Matt 😎🤣🤣
My wife was asking: is this car worth more than you? I said: "this bitch is worth more than my 14 generations" haha
That engineer sounds very German for an Italian 🤔
"Nothing personal kid"
Op🔥🔥
It's not done 300mph yet only the prototype did
He should have checked those pipes with a stick. Maybe they are fake. Oh and how much i can savevon bugatti with the carvow app?
The Bugatti Chiron is a beast But it's really ugly McLaren F1 is still a stunner  Ferrari F40 is still the hottest looking supercar
So what's the quater mile time then ?
Why don’t you use Bugatti’s is your drag race
Its 300 kmph not 300 mph
I thought they would design the chiron SS like the record breaking one.  Just look at how this car looks and how it performs you can see that this does not do 300mph. A car with an active aerodynamical wing will have too much drag , this is a knockoff
"Want to see how much you can save....on your new Bugatti...'😋
Matt "The production car will have more sound proofing right" .... **no response ** Why?
What's the best deal I can get for a Chiron through Carwow? I'm interested
No you all know why German cars have the best engineering...robots are responsible 😎
Wherebare your helmets? XD
And he chills with his sunglasses at if itcwas nothing
3:37 imagine driving it at 30 km/h hahahaha
As if you got in Idee wtf
HOW
Where was your specialist timing gear? How do we know the 0 to 60? Haha
At over £3mill, would the stick of truth be made of gold? What a car!  Great video too. The veyron has always been a dream car but....ok I’ve changed my mind 😛
bruh you went 300km/h not 300mph
300km  - 186,411 miles  Matt?
Why restrict the cars to 275mph??? At that speed, is 305mph THAT BIG OF A DIFFERENCE?? So what, I'll die at 305mph but not 275mph? For $3.5mill Euro's, I want 305mph!!!
He’s like a child😂😂 I love it
What a piece of engineering
Bugatti chiron=🚀
You reach 300kmph not 300mph, why you count it  faster than Koenigsegg and tuatara?
QUALITY
That speeding dial is going up just like my revs
🤣🤣🤣 squealing like a girl. Brilliant!
VW Power
THE DRIP SHHHHEEEEESSSHHHH MATT 🥶🥶🥶🥵🥶
The zippy equipment infrequently undress because bobcat surprisingly prevent against a tiny pocket. rainy, stale surgeon
The unaccountable pediatrician perioperaively hop because hub intialy advise alongside a melodic half-brother. separate, overrated cut
Awesome just awesome 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Same as the another bugatti*
I like this bugatti chiron because it's like not the se as the another bugatti chiron
But why this bugatti exhaust are not like stick together???🤔🤔🤔
Anyone noticed that they do 300kmh and not 300Mph?
Koenigsegg be like- why you always lying
If i were to be rich i would drive my Bugatti everyday
I don’t think that they now that we on Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦 go on the road in a hellcat at          340 km/h 😂😂😂😂
Driver: YES.  ..... Hmmm.... Yes and oh i forgot ... Yes
He looks like discount christin bale from ford vs ferrari
I don't usually like how bugattis look but the bolide, divo and this , they're probably the sexiest care over ever seen
Where is the exhaust test with a stick?😂🤪
Plz we need bugatti chiron vs porsche 911 turbo s 🙏
The engineer sounds like a german nazi
For that laughing I'd have pulled over and booted you out.
am I missing something? 300mph? all i saw was 300 kph....
Damn. I thought he was about to get hit by another chiron
There are plants in the window?
Hey Mat I love ur vids. They are so interesting and I get most of my car knowledge through ur channel. I had one Question that what are those green things on top of the engine?
This is a fake carwow video. No stick of truth.
We got a good car comparison for the Chiron too! You´ll safe 3000 pounds
😍😍😍
300kph*
shotgun tailpipes ; ]
Did you buy one with carwow?
Whos watching this in 2021?
The second clerk literally hope because shark byerly guard of a pathetic fisherman. pastoral, jumpy step-grandfather
What a machine
Hey do a review of SSC tautara bro
You know what's funny. It's germans making italian cars
Misleading title, They went 300kmh not MPH big difference actually
Kinda disappointed the title says 300mph. 300kmh is not 300mph. Sad face.
Max Speed 303mph
Is this faster than koenigsegg
Mat : this is the best car In the world  Devel sixteen has joined the chat
I remember when my dad pinned his 90 mustang gt 5.0 and what feeling
Title says 300mph and they did 300kmph. James “Captain Slow” May did 407kmph on a Veyron.
James May did 407kmph on a Veyron.
mat is a pioneer
All good! Are we not forgetting something here hmm. . .O yes Koenigsegg and yepp i am a Swed and i am very proud of the engineering master pieces from the south of Sweden. I love and deeply respect all these dream hyper car builders but if one compere the "humangus" W16 quad turbo powerplant to the V8 in the "Super swede" i think they would get more like 2000+ hp in that Bugatti. Anyway they are both works of art and i really respect the engineering of them both!
Good for you. Who are you oh. Don't care.
Fast car. But still, 𝗟𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗿'𝘀 𝗶𝗻 5
How does he not fog up his sunglasses while driving? Lol
It would go even faster without those two potted plants on the back shelf....
i guess if u look closely it says on the meter 300km per hour
Its in km/h its not miles an hour
300km per hour not 300m per hour
how much can i save for buying this thrw carwow
That fastist i've been was on an airplane
that speed meter showing kmh isn't it  where is the stick of truth??? ;)
Where are the Center Caps in the Wheels?!?! lol
Why does the title say 300mph when it’s 300kph (186mph)
Mat, You are very lucky,  what a car..
dreams money can buy
7:22 😂
French car , french effect
Thatis shame to they wont let you to drive. Shame bugarri
Who else left after 30 seconds?
Did you remember to water the two plants in the back?
Now the fastest car is SSC tortura
The sound and everything seemed so so smooth, very impressed like always!
Test driver was like a robot. C'mon man!
No
When even a professional car reviewer cannot shake off Bugatti's peasantry attitude, that just tells you it is not a good car company.
U driving 300Kph not miles...
Videos title says mph but in videos it shows kmh?
Poke it with the stick of thruth!
Pointless
Didn't I hear the drive say that the maximum speed he can do today is 300 KILOMETERS per hour?  At 10:07
Wow thats the car!! and I bet the sound ..noise feels  ..those feelings won't be much fun in EVs, btw MPH but it was KMH
300 KMPH**
2:17 and if you want one of these, head to carwow and see how much you can save...
300 kph?
Wonder why Matt didn't do a stick of truth 🤔🤔
it is not the fastest car in world..
The acceleration to 300 kph was just ridiculous.. Wish I had £3.5m kicking about..
It's 300 km /hr but carwow titeld it to 300 mph/ hr
300 km/h not 300 mph correct your title
How fast in 1/4 mile?
its when u matt said they used 614bhp and travled at 300kph in about 6 seconds.. it displays 1614 hp hhaa
Koeningsegg
Jerk Driver
happy owner of a veyron
The driver looks and tells like an german people
Why does the title say 300mph? It’s 300kmh.
This  seems like a less cooler batmobile
Watson laugh like a fool.
It looks quite leisurely at the start, but then you look at the speedometer and it's gone past 100km/h !!!
300kph not mph.  That’s only 186mph
Hey carwow we want to see Bugatti vs Pagani
MAT test your Audi if your Audi breaks the chrion world record
So a super sport chrion
186mph is very different from 300mph so false advertising don't watch this, waste of time
300 km/h
I’ve just purchased mine
Well its 2021
Carwow vs  supercar blondie
Forget 0-60MPH - I want a comparison test of 200-300 KM/H  any car that can reach that speed.
its not mph is it km/h ?
Open a/c
That car looks PHENOMENAL!!
welp, I got click baited as the title says 300mph and in the video, it's 300km/h.
Wow super 🔥😍😍
Christian to mat - Get back to the passenger seat Yianni - Helo Mr. Yess... You don't talk to my friend like dat.. Lemme get my Lambo Mat.. will burst his German Toy for good😁😂
Dude that’s 300 kmh not mph
Video title states MPH, this is clearly in KPH. Who are you trying to fool ?????
Why is the grill different than in the world record version?🤔
Mat are you really review car for 20 years?
300 kph, about 186mph.  The headline is designed to grab attention, but its not true.
Give this car to Yiaani Yiaani Says : In Me Power  😂😂😂 Heheheh
0:05 Koenigsegg regera laughing beside 😂
300kmph *
That was 186 mph. VW owns a test facility called Ehra-Lessien that has a 5.4 mi straight-away. Bugatti made several of its high speed runs there (261 mph max). Nardo Italy has a banked circular 7.8 mi track perfect for high speed testing. 300 mph = 483 kph.
Kind of let down that he actually went 186 MPH. Now that I think of it, 300 wouldn't be achievable on a track like that. But the clickbait title was a bummer.
try doing over 400
The tired hot respectively shock because numeric secondarily whistle versus a foolish condor. tasteful, brash butcher
Tesla roadster doesn’t stand a chance😂
Buggati chiron only has speed, it makes no sense to buy it, since you can buy a roll royce dawn or porsche panamera. In the city you can only reach 100 kilometers per hour, so a car that reaches 300 is useless.
Imagine hit by it at max speed
i've never heard Mat laugh like that before, lol. Sounds like fear, hahaha
whoo that matte black is AMAZING
Why do u have to be a engineer to drive a  300mph car
@6:52 you said 614hp? The gauge said 1614 ps
Still looks boring to me not enough excitement in it and some of you will just be like na you're jealous you can't afford it and no I can't afford it but even if I could I promise you I'd still not buy it personally I don't care for cars really there boring and slow I only appreciate ones that feel like there going to kill you and you actually need skill this is why I ride a motorbike it's way more fun and adrenaline pumping I also say it takes more skill to ride plus they're way cheaper than half these ridiculous priced cars that still struggle to beat stock bikes 😂
the fastest i've even went in a car was 160km/h and that was the max speed of the car
" this is work!" 😜😙
normal supercars have  twin turbo engine when this  sport car has quad turbo engine
He isn’t even going 200mph 🤦‍♂️
Damn, a few years ago Mat was being slated for reviewing the Alfa Romeo "wrong" and here he is. Well played
Ummm 180mph only
Whats that behind mat and the driver looks like a plant
300MPH????????? YOU went like 180-200 -.- FAIL. Misleading title.
WOOOOOOOW AWESOME
U said 300 mph but is was kph
Whats with te pots in the rear windscreen
I think you confused mph with km/h
"What a way to lose your Bugatti 🍒" 😂😂😂
10min to watch the speedo go to 300... kmh... now thats a waste of internet
i hope the drone and the car are safe and not cashed into a pole and the drone would carsh into a man or into the water maybe?
Your knee close to the "Motor Not Aus" Button freaked me out..(8 Thx for the funny insight!
Matt: *Asks too much questions*  I think the engineer wants to tell him to shut the f##k up so badly.        And you went 300 kph not mph
I love Bugatti's
Are there two pots of plants between the cabin and engine compartment?
It touched 0-100 similar to how my car touches 0-20  in the same time. 🥴
Koenigsegg Gemera...
Next, wait for the Tesla Roadster.
Just normal speeds at Autobahn
Ahh we cruise in 300 KMPH at Autobahn
Just a normal in Germany
Thats 300Kmh not Mph. Clickbait?
insane
This Bugatti accelerates from 0-300 kmh just like my toyota aqua 0-60 kmh lol..
DAYUM
nice
How many companies do you own? VW: YES
Fun fact i when as fast as 1000km/h for 500 dollars and it's called ethiopian airlines.
I love how 0-60mph in this car is just one wild, smooth 1st gear pull. Doesn't even look like it has any traction issues either. Insane!
its not 300mph its 300 kph
Imagine buying a new car and finding out it's restricted to 275 mph !   I'm sure we can all sympathise with the predicament of Chiron owners.
I don't like Bugatti, but that Chiron is sexy
WARNING THIS IS CLICKBAIT !! He actually only goes 300 KLMH
it was not u the driver was
So you hit 300kph which is 198mph, not 300mph?
No it's not the fastest car
Clickbait
Misleading title , you’re only going 300 km not mph
99.9% of us in the comments knowing damn we will never afford this car
smokey can do faster with v12 supra and 1100ps gtr also in Nardo
well present fastest is SSC Tuatara
That's only approximately 186 mph. This video is mislabeled.
Really nice video! I think the Swedish Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut is even faster though at 500km/h or 330mph. 🙂
The way its climbs to 300 is like so effortless. Sounds like a normal car aswell. OMG
sorry but that was 300kmh and not 300mph...
The Engeneer is obviously a German xD
You lucky BarStud Matt 😂 I'm so jealous... 💥
Why they got dollar general plants in the back of a Bugatti Chiron
so not 300mph, 186mph. = 300kph
Mat, I Think the NEW Tesla Roadster is faster than a bugatti?
- Mat : “ This is the fastest car in the world “ - Christian von Koenigsegg : “ Sorry, say it again, I didn’t hear you very well... “
What's about Tuatara 🤔
Is Batman ok with you lot driving his car?
Whats its quarter mile time?
8.0 W16 to I4 is 2.0 I4... Engine hevier than Fiat 126P.
*Isn't it*
Why did they change the grill? This one is like the one on the standard chiron, the world record car had a bigger one🤔
6million dallar car dude so cool my dreamcar
Vw mk2  beaten buggati chiron
Mat: "this is the fastest car in the world" Elon musk with his T E S L A Roadster: "Am I a Joke to you?"
You wouldn’t have to worry about cops ever again they wouldn’t even be able to see you. Especially on the highway you wouldn’t even have to care if you passed one. You probably gonna be able to make bond too
I felt sorry for you when you where screaming
I’m thinking the new Tesla roadster 2020 is 6 milli seconds faster
Ssc tautara****
I want you test drag khoenigseg agera
The hell  The Bugatti Chiron SuperSport 300+ is 1600 HP   But the rare ospark Owl is 2012 hp    Some rare cars are being underused
Nimic nu i mai brutal decat m6 le lui Andy Popescu
It wasnt 300mph it was only 300kmh
The bugatti chiron 300+ has a top speed of 303mph or 501kmh
Remember Bugatti's movie record by bmw 6 series
Christian lowkey so funny 😂😂😂
What is the point of it being restricted to buyers but 25mph?? Like 275mph is so much safer.
5:12😂😂😂😂😂
If I was in the car, a very, very fast stream of urine would be flying out the window.
Looks like imitation not real.
Matt in the bugatti: HAOOAHAHAOHAOHAOHAOHOAHOAHOAHAO The driver: 😐
The g forces when it goes from 0-120 is practically crazy😂😂 like a plane taking off on the runway
What a incredible beauty and Sexy and delicious and gorgeous that 🖤 2021 Bugatti Chiron Supersport 300+🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
Next episode must be Suzuki Jimmy Vs Bugatti Chiron super sport
love this guys reaction 😁
The driver looks like he drove more bugattis than golfs
Koenigsegg its the fastets car
🤩
300mph or 300kmph🎊???
This made me say carwow!!
The Bugatti engineer should audition for the Terminator movie. He spoke like an android.
Title ripped off 😂 300km/h but waw car didint feel like its on 300 km/h
I was expecting the engineer to say something like: "I'm a cybernetic organism. Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton".
The sound inside the car when they speeding is like a quiet airplane
Wow
300mph?
Mat: I’m the first to go in Driver who drove from the shop: I’m I a joke to you
Lord aleem is fuming rn
The speedo meter of that car goes faster than my RPM😂😅
I thought the drive was Linus from Linus Tech Tips ... Kind Weird
Imagine getting a 300mph ticket 😭😭😭
I think Bugatti should work on their inside
Tuatara has entered the chat
volkswagen engine ftw
1614hp not 614 matt come on
the car went 300 KPH,not mph
Just magical...
SSC: am i a joke to you?
Kunnegseg laughing at this video😂😂😂
feels good to know that the speed this car reached in 15 seconds is the speed my car isn't gonna reach in 15 years.
300 kph, not 300 mph. Still impressive.
Those alloys look aftermarket
matt was so hyped ja
The most ugly pant on that Bugatti
Hahahaha l’italiano che non Sto arrivando! Cosa rispondere : YES...
this car went 0-100 in first fucking gear
That's fast, But..... TWO WORDS= SSC Tuatara :https://youtu.be/N22JfNHiC1k 532km/h Damn
The driver is german... for sure- just like me. :-) One can hear it .
Looks like it has a Flux Capacitor in the back window.
Yes yes yes I said go we go and go go yes yes
He went 300kph lol not MPH
carWOOOOOOOW
That’s a jet on wheels
Big clickbait with that misspelled mph while its kph... it would be 482kph to achieve 300mph
shit seatbelts
Imagine Hennessy and buggati doing a collab woah
The driver is the king of understatement.
Buggati Chiron is very fastest car in the world for all time
This track and car remember me of that PS2 Gran Turismo 3, oval track, with that Suzuki red rally car (huge wings) with 800+ hp, before we put those big turbos on it, reaching horse power and top speed similar to this Bugatti. Awesome.   ( X ) Achievement unlocked
This is a airplane with its 400km/h. It kept accelerating to 300km like its nothing lol..
I feel like the car is cheap and fragile although i know it isnt but it makes me feel like that because the whole weight reduction thing
NEIGH NEIGH NEIGH
Someone doesn't know the difference between MPH and KM🤦‍♂️
Heyyyyy mat bro.......... have you seen ssc tuatara top speed run onboard????
Ssc Tuatara Hit 331 MPH, new record
Why didn't they make the wheels out of carbon fibre from Carbon Revolution? Carbon fibre is 30% stronger and 50% lighter than magnesium.
can it run doom?
I thought theres flower pots behind
"Everybody should be allowed to experience this once in their life."...Yeeeah no.
The equivalent of losing your virginity to Ms Universe.
Not 300 mph... It's Kph
it's a huper car
Title is misleading he goes 300kph NOT mph. Not a worlds first by any means. 300 kph is like 185mph. Not even 200mph. The title needs changing. Shame on you!  The speedo says 500kph on it..I looked that up and it's 310mph. So that is a good idea of what the production car will do.   Bit of a shame this run was limited. I thought I was gonna see a road car do 300mph. I'm not unimpressed, just disappointed. I've seen the original Veyron go faster than this.
i have expirienced it but not with buggati
amazing power
sorry when it goes up in down n a hurry
i like it only thing for me is round corners very heavy,and spoiler looks silly bit yer
what's with the title? "I'm the FIRST to go in the 300mph Bugatti Chiron Super Sport *WORLD EXCLUSIVE*" You did 300 km/h, not mp/h :)
Brits always be in fast cars!
Mental
Matt go have a go in a Konigsegg Regara this Chiron will feel slow in comparison.Acceleration wise.
Mat looks so funny
Wow
They are going 300 just like i go 50
The speedometer says kph? 300 km/h is less than 200 mph..
So where is the film of you going 300 mph?  This was 300 kph.
Awesome 👏
8:21 when he said “woah” and it went to outside shot, I thought they crashed ngl
What do not telling us it's only a 186 miles an hour Zo6 Corvette can do that
I wanna ride!
I wish to have that experience in my lifetime
Amazing
you said it went till 300mph but in the speedometer its showing 300km  it should be 510mph if its miles per hour
Next trend 0-300 km/s in xx seconds
bunch of lies
This looks so good
내가 평생 보지도 타지도 가지지도 못할 차
Bugatti: we have the 300 mph Bugatti Hennessy: mark my words Hennessy car: goes 310 mph Bugatti: :(
The driver is so chill everytime he probably rides an airplane he would be snoring.
*so fast*
0:47 "normal Chiron"
Watching the speedo go up that fast, and keep going up like that... It was like on a video game. Your a lucky guy, man. And your excitement - it shows.  Great video.  PS.  I wonder what that engineer drives.  lol.
Tesla and the roadster: *t i m e t o g o f a s t e r*
The plants on the parcel shelf look like they need watering. Nice touch though :-D
this is very very impressive dont get me wrong. But Daniel Ricciardo set a 4.2 sek 0-200 time with his Renault this year. Just shows how incredibly fast the Sport is getting...
Couldn’t imagine having that cackling laugh while concentrating on a high speed run
hey mate,did you do a drag race with a bugatti....i didn't see one on carwow...it would be awesome 👌
I cant take my eyes off you.
Matt really wants it at 300mph😂😂😂
This car has a cool feature that you cannot buy it
Bugatti's Dashboard looks ugly
Damn that's only 186mph.. 300 must be nuts!
Well it's just BUGGATI and he's screaming like that,can you go in kongeggseg agera?? But with death this time thanks Good luck
It’s actually 300 kms
Look in the rear view mirror...there's definitely a diesel Audi rep mobile up your arse.
This is KM/H not MPH. Correct it 😒
The exhaust is like that to work the diffuser harder equaling more downforce from the Venturi tunnel underneath the vehicle
He didn't sit in Bobas Golf 2 it's runing like 60psi 1100+ HP and is 1200kg and it's all wheel drive.
There are sooo many limitations, to much banking, special tyres etc etc. Koenigsegg uses off the shelf tyres and does speed runs on normal roads (closed for traffic) Bugatti did not even do the proper 300mph record, because they would not risk a tyre blowout going the other way on their test track.
The Bugatti Chiron super sport 300+ is not only fast, its, beautiful, aerodynamic and luxurious.
I thought we are going for 300mph. I am sad.
That was nowhere near 300mph?
The fact the Bugatti Chiron renders matt to a child like state, shows the absolute performance of the beast!
Koenisegg is beast
I mean you only did 186mph and I’ve done that between red lights on my motorcycle 😅😅😅
That 1 guy who is actually gonna buy this is like : "yea im gonna buy this ugly fast thing for 3 mill and drive my botox around"
It was 300km/h so 180mph only. Wrong title
big up a l'accent français du chauffeur !
Τιμουλα;
Someone needs to water those plants in the back 🤷‍♂️
Clickbait: The title says 300 mph but you go in the video 300 kmh is not the same.
I experienced 900 .....                                           in an airplane ✈️
Should've asked for a Bugatti face mask.  That would add quite a bit to the story to tell one day.
This is what going fast is all about. Pushing the limits, innovating, breaking records. I’m sad that this is Bugatti’s last “fastest car in the world” build.
Fun fact : At 1 point Matt says that they used 614 BHP during a pull. However , He didn't notice at that moment that the screen said 1614 BHP 😆😆😆
Damnnn
Rs6 klasen is better to 0-300
Did you seriously not change the video title. You only went 300 kph
Matt: this is the fastest car in the world😁 Koenigsegg: 🤣 that's what y'all think for now
Matt you said 300MPH in your video description and the car is actually doing 300 KPH in the speedometer which is officially 186MPH .  And the way you are pretending inside the car only to convince audience that car actually doing 300MPH . I don’t know why you guys do that .
My God, what a machine! The speedometer was ridiculous. 0-250 like nothing!!!
👍👍💗
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opewaiLckxA  you can see it at top speed here
the speedo said 300kph not mph
That's not a car that's a rocket🙆🏿‍♂️🤯🤯
The acceleration, on the first half, is on par with gravity rate I think?  Like sky diving from airplane.  It takes this car 13.5secs to 300km/h speed from 0, equal 22km/h gain a second.   That makes 22000m/3600s/s , or 6.1 m/s2  while gravity acceleration = 9.8 m/s2.  So the car did match gravity acceleration during 0-150km/h after that its harder to push the speed up (for an already extremely fast speed) so it lost to gravity acceleration after 150km/h onward.  Am I doing it right?
On the 30 units, when buyers want to go over 300mph on the special circuit, do they have to change anything on the car or is there just the electronic system to unlock ? And are the tires that resist 500 km / h already standard on the car ? Thanks for your answer
Matt plz take off your muzzle. Bilions of people are looking at You.
0:07-0:25-0:43
Der Fahrer ist einn Deutscher das hört man XD
Sanaol!
Man mat I want to do this one day
Wonder what the 60-130 is
This is 300kmh why the title is 300mph?
300mph  ??!!
When you order next day delivery off amazon.
"Plaid Mode"...is coming for the rest of us.
It reminds of the time in 1993 when i first sat in a 1986 c reg 323i, it felt like the ' Nemesis', the Alton Towers Ride!
I think this is my favorite car wow video. Matts laugh that first time to 300kph is brilliant. 😂
OMG! Very very very fast! Amazing car!
Want to see how much u can save on buggati chiron super sport+?
The title says 300mph. Its kmh right?
its not miles it kilometers per hour
Fun maths:  At 3.5 million euros, and 30 units sold, that's 105 million euros net profit.
Best god ever man
Watching this I’ve lost my Bugatti cherry 🍒
14.0 from 0 o 300, 0-60 2.fucking 4
I would love to see race bettwen this and gemera or jesko!
This car literally sounds like a space jet wow
On the end I thought you guys were going to say "How much you can save on a new Bugatti"
It's 300kmh not 300mph.
300kph not 300mph
That is not the fastest car the fastest car is the devils 16
U need to do drag race that VS. Koenigsegg jesko or something like that
Title is wrong, he did 186 mph which is 300 km/h.  A Chiron can hit 186 without breaking a sweat.
So what exactly happened !!!
Dislike only for the masks.
Let’s be honest. Matt has the dream job.
How much could i save on a Bugatti Matt?
300 KPH is only 180 miles per hour! Your title said 300 MPH???
300 mph ? In your dreams !!! 300 kph...deal !!
Plz move to passenger seat yea I can't hear you over the engine I'll bring it back in a bit wait you said what?? Then vroom away I go
This guy couldn't be more German lol
I think you might have made a mistake in your titel. It sais 300 mph but it´s 300 kmh.
The speedo meter of that car goes faster than my RPM😂😅
Romans chapter 10 verse nine if you declare with your mouth Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead the Bible says you will be saved
Everyone gangsta untill Mat doing stick of truth on Chiron
can't wait when someone removes the limiter
1500hp to go 260 and 1600hp to go 304? hmmmm 🤔
"I'm the FIRST to go in the 300mph Bugatti Chiron Super Sport *WORLD EXCLUSIVE*" ...at *186*mph
6:50 'Six _teen_ hundred and fourteen horsepower...'
I wonder about what car does the engineer drives
Doug be like: Time to lick.
But why didn't they allow you to drive
you review car 20 year but u don't know about difference about mile and kilometer
The only reason I buy lottery tickets.
Matt the drama queen*
Anyone else think there were a pair of house plants in the back?
Damnnnn 9:35
The speedometer moves like the tachometer
😂😭
it's Not 300M/PH. it's 300KM/H.
Koenigsegg is faster
I want to drive it around the homeless shelters
Hey Matt you have an error in your title 😉
“THESE are not the doors of a billionaire!!”
The Bugatti driver sounds like from german 🤔
Hundreds of CarWow videos later, this Golf driver still doesn't know the difference between mph and kph?
Disappointed that the stick of truth didn’t come out for the exhausts and vents.
Should put a Bugatti in a drag race
4:13 my Wife in a nutshell
I'll bet in a twist of grand irony that if you actually measured the average speed of all Bugatti's sold they'd have the lowest average of any cars. Most will be sat in secure garages or out the front of Monaco casinos doing 0 for most of their life
Careful, Mat! It looks like a Bugatti’s about to crash into you! AAAAAH
Its 300kmh on the board not mph as you said. I'm disappointed...
You can’t Really review a car if you didn’t drive it
Koenigsegg has entered the chat...
is there plants in the window?
SPEEDOMETTER STOPS AT 500KPH. Enough said.
Batmobile black
But you wasn't first.
Please remove your freaking masks.
Ride along with a robot.
I saw two people in masks and turned it off.
in the tiltel ( I'm the FIRST to go in the ~~~~~~~300mph~~~~~~~~~ Bugatti Chiron Super Sport *WORLD EXCLUSIVE*)   (~~~300 mph  = 482,803 kmh~~~)     I don't think that you drove 482 kmh  pls change the titel !
Came to see (w/out believing it is possible) 300mph, got disappointed by the km/h…
Ese Bugatti no tiene pantalla táctil
300 km/h... that is not impressive.
But how much can I save on one through Carwow ?
That is the sickest Chiron ever made
What do you think your achieving wearing a mask while spending a long time in a small space with one person? Pathetic
7:42
There's a point where wings should be providing lift, not downforce.
Hope u we're wearing a diaper might need to chance tour trousers lol🤣🤣👍👍👍
If i am not mistaken, lotus evija claims to do 0-300 under 10 seconds, so there is that matt, you should test one
7:25 such a wholesome moment :D
This thing is faster 0-186 mph than my car is to 60...
But who drove the car there...
The Chiron SS is nice 👍💯
Are you lying. Koenigsegg jesko absolute is the fastest car in 2020. Reaching at a maximum speed of 532kmh is equivalent to 330 mph.
1:00 I can tell the people in the background are cray rich cuz they didn’t bother looking at a million dollar car
It's only just changing to 6th at 300km/h and it still has another gear after that
I will buy Bugatti in future.
That was 300kmh not 300mph
300 kph not mph
What about Hennessey?
Jajja buenísimo video! Casi podemos sentir esa emoción por la reacción de Matt 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
I thought it was 300mph... This was actually 300km/h. My 1.6 astra can do that speed.
Looks like theres flower pots on back of car
MANTAP
MANTAP SUDARWANTO HARIYONO SUDARWANTO HARIYONO, SE MANTAP
I d4ive 1.2 litre swift and I am watching this
Mat, want see how much you can save on a Bugatti Chiron ...donut , 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🥰🥰
1/4 mile?
👍👏
For God sake  please  bring to Maclaren and let see
That’s kmh that’s not mph
Is there anyone else who thout the cableboxs behind the windows were flowers
Buggati: I can hit 300mph +  Koenigsegg: hold my beer
How many of you guys wait for the notification of someone replied your commen😁😁😁😁😁
So it is only 275mph? they are not producing 300mph car for streets and one way cmoon.
Him: I’m the first one! The bug that was on the Bugatti when it hit 300+ mph: I’m bouta end this mans whole career
being in Bugatti for the first time feels so amaaazzzzzziiinnnnnngggggg. and being in a model tht isn't produced till now is Mindboggling.....
Is this the first time - Yes. Am I the first journalist - That is a fact. Yes. So German that his middle names are Vorsprung Durch Technik...
In the GTR, it is dumb to go 40 - 80 clilometers per hour according to the limit, because they are there at the very beginning of the speedometer, and here these are generally the first couple of divisions
I was thinking "why are there yuca plants on the engine?", but I guess it's testing gear.
Take that supercar blondieee!!
This is such a good and funny video. The european accent engineer fits the stereotype to a T and how he loves answering in short blunt answers.
300 km/h jerk wad.
Christian:This car is not the beauty one.This is a development car. TATA Nano: WUT?
Although I can't criticize you for not driving, I don't think you lose your cherry until you get behind the wheel,,,,,,,,,,,
How can I get a car off of Carnot like a 18
cant find a carwow deal with a Bugatti chiron
Since they have lost money with their previous truck, they decided to change the body, increase the power and label it as a new truck. What would be a lap time on the Nordschleife ?  I have seen trucks and vans around on youtube, so it shall be allowed .
Like terminator taking you for a drive.
Ultra-torque.
Favorite words; “Isn’t it?”
France 🇫🇷💪
300 KM/H not MPH nice video
Hello from Russia
Kph*
LAD/ lying ass dog
looks amazing at the back
how is this this 300mph??
4:57 HHAHHAHHHHAHAHAHA
Ferrari 599xx evolution.
I guess the real question is: should you avoid it, consider it, shortlist it... or go right ahead and buy it?
Mat....I want to buy a Bugatti chiron, so how much can I save from carwow????
His cackling laugh is so fking annoying
Bugatti Chiron: i'm The fastest car în The world Koenigsegg agera rs: hold my beer!
Finally Batman let you his car to test it!
What am I missing here. That wasn't 300mph, that was 300kph. 300mph would be 450kph ish'.
Starts 5:00
Anyone else notice ...the new version also comes with matching potted plants!?
Bugatti recommendation even though they won’t see it, they should and more electric power for the launch with the boost of the engine creating more hp, but a faster 0-60 mph/km/h  Also, extending the back end making it sorta like the f1 long tail could improve more aero, fenders would be great and maybe a better splitter that can have the wind flow travel through the splitter, to the fenders pushing more air around it that getting caught in it.   Also, roofscoop, it’ll add more of a cooling for the engine so it could push as much as it can, more aero, more powah, more speed!   I think I went out of it... 🤔
300km = 186mph
I don't like it, it doesn't look so fancy
So why does the odometer go up to 500 if it won’t go up that far?
The driver is a real man and Matt screaming like a girl lol
Clickbait the mph..... Forgot your units of speed there, havent cha?
Yeah that wasn’t 300mph that was 300kph big difference
If Mat says “ isn’t one more time “ ...
Fucked up Mat there didn’t he 😂😂😂😂
You said in the title 300mph but the speed is in km/h
Clickbait you go in kph not mph
joyfully useless
i think there is a great difference between k/hr and mile/hour.......i could see in the dial 300 km/h and  you wrote 300 mile/h.
So it's basically like having that weird chest feeling in a taycan/model S but all the way up to 300+ km/h ... I'd die
Matt Watsons with the CrazyRussianHacker, nice.
The speedometer says km/h, not mph. So why does Matt keep saying 300 mph?
Please feature this car in your next drag race!
That looks like a bat mobile
This colour is ass
The English of the driver is soooo German 😂😂
The Tesla is still 100x faster
Since when were engineers esteemed as professional car drivers?
Mat you went 300km/h not mph cars limited to 300km/h - 186mph not a hater of the channel either love the drag races need to get a Bugatti one day and drag race it
BMW M5 V10 SPEED 350 NO LİMİT
You are lier it's 300 km/h , no 300mhp/h
Holy shit that was so fast
The video says MPH... I wasted 10 min of my life for KPH.... Thanks assholes
300kmh
Constant acceleration over the whole speed range.
300mph or 300km/h?  all we have seen was 300km/h
3.5 before.....
Where’s the 5 annoying things?! Are the exhausts real? How much can I save on one? Do I shortlist or go right ahead and buy it?! Come on #carwow so many unanswered questions!!!
nhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhmmhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
The best acceleration ever 🤩 thank you for the experience Matt ✌🏽
300kph is not 300mph
Are there plants in the back of the car?
Wait a sec how come the speedometer said 300km but the title said 300mph so really he only went 183mph
“isn’t it” “yes”
that man is very efficient
What a joke. 180 mph. I thought we'd at least see 400 kph.
6:29 speed limit on naruto...lmao auto captions are drunk
Matt: this is the new Bugatti and it's the fastest car in the world... Supra: am I a joke to you??
The fastest car ever? NOPE!
its so obvious that the engineer is from Germany because of his accent
5:21 it slows down to 300-kmh
i have seen 300 km/h not 300 mph!!😀😀😀
Is this suppose to be camo ? Only reason for a spec like that
This video is 40% clickbait as the speed wasn't anywhere near advertised.
Thts a joke. The 300miles is a prototype. I didnt at least 1 youtuber said that chirron is not the fastest production car. What a joke.
260 in the 4th gear!
The first gear gets you to 100km/h nice
Espero la traducción de este video en carwow latinoamérica ♥️
Just to seeing Matt's reaction is worth watching. Must have been a great day for him as a journalist and car fan
0:55 Wait a minute! Those are speed holes! Just like in The Simpsons.
Not a production car so no it’s not the fastest get your facts straight
imagine going at 500kph on the autobahn, i feel like there should be a limit you wont see a car coming at u at 300 mph before its too late
why is it slow from 0- 100 km/h ?
Wtf?? Take off those ridiculous masks!
Not a production car yet lol
Drag race Yianni in this thing
To be frank a modern liter bike or above can literally demolish it upto 330-345 but after that Bugatti takes the lead, but hey race will be over way before that and no track will give you that straight, until it's a 1 mile drag race, below ANYTHING that bikes will win
Matt reaction was crazy and not natural
Isn't it ! 🤦‍♂️
Parece que está grabado en IDIADA
So it’s not really a 300 + car,  275 limited when purchase
Tesla: all you need is 30,000 dollars
That is a fake 300+
Description says 300mph..but they went 300kmph,I didn’t quite get it
That ride was $30,000.
Is it Really the Fastest Production Car? EVER??? the word EGG  comes to mind but she Issa Beaut
That said 300km/h
The speedo is in Kph not not mph.  You did 300 kph.   That's 190 MPH.  Close up of the speedo at 7:56.
no
Slight difference between 300 kph and MPH!!!
can we just agree, he did 300 KM/H, and not 300 mph ;-)
300 mph? or kmh? big difference
The Bugatti engineer is rude "That's not going to happen, move to the passengers seat" 😒
Are those plants in the rear window I'm seeing?
Dude acts gay af...
Just Put 4000HP+ sticker to your car and then See the magic
I love how it's just a 300 mph Rolls Royce.
Race it vs the tesla
20years reviewing cars and this is Mats first time in Bugatti... Hmmm. Hey supercar blondie where r u?
The most exciting Bugatti video I've watched so far
Wonder what the engineers dailydriver is ...
The bugatti engineer HAS to be a German Engineer after you hear him talk
300kmh is NOT 300 mph. Why the lie?
The title is completely wrong
I am dissapointed, where is the stick of truth?
Car looks incredible in that matte black finish
*The german accent from the dude hahahhahha* *Ehrenmann!*
Tesla is better
A ka naj shqiptar ktu (albanian)
Devil 16 subscribe buggit like
garbage channel
Technicality that Bugatti isn’t the record holder because that car isn’t in production yet but it is the fastest car in the world unofficially
2:42 what are you wearing on your face? Is that required to go 300mph? Or is it for the pandemic? (NOTE: regardless of what you think, being a such a closed space, unless you have the windows down, you both will be breathing in/out the same air.)
Real emotions
Why’s there plants in the back window
So they just did 300 km/h, which is just under 190mph, if the title is right and it really is only 2/3 as the engineer said then this car can do 450km/h🥴
That blows my mind that those valve stem caps weigh 16 pounds, not even at full speed
Matt “every other car is going to be slow “  koenigsegg “ slow “
300 km/h in a chiron ss seems like 100 kmh in a normal car .
It is not the fastest var Ib the world
Sorry Matt, but the Koenigsegg Jesko is the fastest car EVER!
Should get Yianni to buy one so you can review it
I don’t understand why marques like Bugatti bother letting youtubers review their cars. It’s not like people who can actually afford these cars care what carwow has to say about them.
Well deserved Matt!!!!
Matt this bugatti engineer and Yanni would make the best new Top Gear trio....
Well, as per the title, I came here to see 300 mph....should have known...
I love how it’s limited “for safety” to 275!!! Typical Bugatti.
Was he ever in a koenigsegg Agera RS or one?😎
You really hear that the engineer is a German... now you know why the car is that fast😉
The stick of truth can be found in Mat's pants and that is not a fake exhaust at 303 km/h
Wow. MASSIVE click bait title. 300 kmh is NOT 300 mph. In reality you went 186 ish mph. All for views. Pretty lame you claimed “I’m the first, reeeeeeee!”
😭😭😭😭😭😭
*"It's the fastest production car ever made." -- Mat* IT IS NOT A PRODUCTION CAR, AND OTHER PRODUCTION CARS ARE FASTER.
Actually you are not the first. There was a German YouTube channel when someone was driven around a track in one back in April.
Bugatti guy seems Alittle Smug...idk lol,annnnnddd I bet a porche will still beat it 😄
Ferrari fxx k evo vs ferrari la ferrari *****😃😃  which one is faster ?  Mclaren p1   vs mclaren speedtail Lykan      vs  fenyr
Fasest car hes been in? He needs to come to the US where we've got UGR lambos and 2k+ GTRs all day
First ever with a mask on! Normal times very soon please!!!
Now ride along in a Koenigsegg next!
Where is the carwow discount.......
Alguien habla español
You shouldnt drive 450 kmh with that bugatti because it could glitch you out of the world
Holy cow!!  That speed...Damn!
very very very FAST
I hoped he would poke it with a stick 😢
@carwow, how many seconds does it take for this bugatti to complete the quarter mile? 😃 I really am trying to put its speed into perspective. 😃
So it can do 300mph, but not on a test track because the tyres are shit.
It can do 300mph but not if you own one.
People are starving and dying from Covid. Shit like this doesn't mean anything.
when the buggati engineer came and said sorry it's not gonna happen then mat was like aww man I relly wanted to drive this buggati
4 secs 100-200 👍
*Purchase full speed DLC to unlock 300 Miles per hour*
Awesome video
What? 1500 hp
300 km/h is not 300 mp/h. title error?
Fix the title it's a lie!  Says 300mph, but they only hit 300kph... that's a BIG difference!
Another bullshit Bugatti test...  It just proves it's fast in a straight line, something we already knew, it's an obese over engineered overated supercar.  Put It against other supercars in a real world test with corners..  (Bugatti panic attack) see how far behind the others the Bugatti is...  Strange how Bugatti test drivers only test it on oval test tracks.. I'll pass on giving it a go..  Much prefer to be in a REAL driver's car, say a Koenigsegg. Something that's not just a pretentious posing machine
This is all off. For starters that was 300kph not mph. Secondly the Agera RS is the worlds fastest car.
"- ...Isnt it ? - Yes."
I’ll part exchange my mums VWs for this.
Jeez, that thing accelerates like it's in a vacuum!
Bugatti Chiron isn’t the fasted car in the world the Hennessy venom GT is
His giggle at 5:15 hahaha
Bugatti: Rawwwwring & Guzzling the fuel Mat: screaming from the top his lungs! Buggati Driver: Yes.
Crazy how consistently the speed climbs up. Like it could go on forever at that rate. Its like the acceleration is constant through 0-300 kmph. Of course it isnt but it feels like it from watching the speedometer
You are one lucky sod Matt.
It is and always be the best car ever, Bugatti for ever
482.8 kilometers per hour for you men of culture out there
You too lie you just love the fast ride lol of 303mph
Race that against New Porsche 911 turbo s
I think mat u should try the koenigsegg jesko absolut
If you don't giggle like a girl then there's something wrong with you.
How muco can i save with carwow in a Bugatti Chiron? 😂 What a great video. It must have been a hell of an experience! You’re having a blast, clearly! 😅
Bugger me sideways mate, the way that speedo does numbers is just obscene!
why are there 2 plants in the back
Koenigegg jesko is The fastest
matt : *wants to go to three hundred* *means mph* engineer: we went to 300 a few times *means kph, cause mph is shit*
Sorry..matt
Wow
Fix the title, you only went 180 mph (300 kph)
“Oh that’s a drone!” “Hahahhahaha”
LEGENDARY
I
Next is konigsegg.,..   "sorry....:)"
How much can I save through carwow for this car 😏
That title is so misleading... They went 300 kph not mph.
Me : driving my Honda  Nobody :  How long it take for u to go 0-60?  My Honda : yes🗿
HE REACTED AS IF HE WAS IN A CAR DOING 300 MILES PER HOUR, INSTEAD OF 300 KILOMETERS PER HOUR. IF THAT WAS HIS GENUINE REACTION TO 186MPH, THEN HE IS UNFIT TO DRIVE EXOTIC CARS. THIS GUY WENT OUT OF HIS WAY TO DECEIVE HIS AUDIENCE. HE HAS TO BE CALLED OUT ON THIS UNTIL HE GOES FOR A RIDE IN A SUPERSONIC JET.
How much can we save on a beauty like this on carwow 😂
its not mph.. its kmph
so you have been doing 300 km/h, not mph...
*LIAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*
*LYING OVERACTOR*  *VOTE THUMBS DOWN!* 300KPH IS NOT THE SAME AS 300MPH. AT ALL! 187MPH IS NOWHERE NEAR 300MPH
That's 300 kph not mph
Yianni hella jealous rn
300 KPH is equal to 186.41 MPH. Not what I was hoping for when I started watching the video.
damn, what a car.
So its restricted to 270 is it. They can bugger off, I'll have the kernogzeg instead. That does 284mph
It's still just a golf.
Matt test drives the fastest car Meanwhile.. Hi guys I am shmee
Has he tested a supra before?
It's 300 kmph not mph
You either go to the Mojave desert or ask VW to go on the proving grounds track. Otherwise pretty much pointless outside Germany
이형 진짜부럽네...젠장...
actually the koenigsegg gemera fastest car ever made plus it for 4 passengers
Kmh not mph 😒🤔
Last run...exactly 13 seconds dead from start to 299kph.
It's a shame the engineer chased Matt out of the drivers seat
Mat but should I shortlist it or just go right ahead and buy it?!
Omg🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓
So that's 186 190 mph....300mph?
when will you review koeniggseg car ?
Wait wait, he has been in a 1000hp supra, it should be faster than that Tesla especially 0-60 even tho it prolly wasn’t anti lag.
Mat Watson is so happy  🏎  😀😀😀
so, what VW is it based on?
4:01 Is it me or does the bugatti chiron have a fuckin boot
I do know that the fastest model S and the 918 Spyder were very close in 0 to 60 but I was under the strong impression that the 918 Spyder was number 1 in 0 to 60 and the tesla number 2
You going in Italy at Nardò to try this?
Also marchettino was there... The biggest Italian cars youtuber!
300mph? This video in only 300Km/h...
Just subscribed today after binge watching all the drag races .
Sat in the passenger side for the best friends ride
Now go back to the UK and as a good british boy (god save the queen etc bullshit) and journalist, review the mclarens and a.martins and praise how superb and brilliant they are....HA HA HA HA. Game over.
What a privilege. Well deserved !
The porsche 911 turbo s is the fastest 1/4 mile in your drag races
Marchettino è il migliore !
Ecxlusive world : marchettino che ha fatto lo stesso video
I was expecting the engineer to say something like: "I'm a cybernetic organism. Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton".
IL PRIMO AD AVERLO PORTATO È MARCHETTINO🇮🇹🇮🇹
what a machine!!!
Get in touch with koeninsegg for a demo in the Jesko absolute now.
I would've appreciated a comment from the engineer about the Chiron's isofix anchor points
Yeah, you seemed to like it... 🤔
They only went 186mph not 300... 🤔
what's behind them at the engine? Flux capacitor?
I think you should shortlist it😌
He's like Ken miles
But Matt that's not 300mph why misrepresent your information. That's 300kmp/h most cars go that fast just not as fast..
I only want to hear one click..
Not sure why I'm watching this. But I had a smile on my face as Matt had an orgasm in the car. I swear this car gets to 300km/h faster than my Toyota to 60km/h.
Clickbait 300kmh not mph
Lucky bugger
Not 300mph it's 300kmh
Hi guys I thought you were going to 300 mph.
The rate at which this car pulls between 50 and 250kph is just _mental!_ I can understand why Matt was hit with a monster endorphin high!
How about yanni bringing his Lambo over to get smashed in a little drag race...
Does the car come with that face mask
6:49 - 614hp? 😂
Really want to see what a cars launch control does starting on a corner . Not just this car but all cars
Can't find when he hit 300 mph?
Surely it used 1614BHP not 614 it would not have been that fast if that was all it used
5:00 that is Not truth! The fastes car you have ever driven is the 911 turbo s because that car does it in 10.1 seconds!!
im in the hood like an engine revvin
im in that bugatti movin 200
Is he german? The driver?
300 miles per hour is different to 300 kilometres per hour... Would think a motor journalist would know that
5:15 Mat went from the usual Mat to The Joker...  BTW, anyone noticed that speedometer?  Supersport cars: Max. Limit 400 Chiron: Max. Limit 500 🙄
Subtitle indonesia please
Why is the title 300mph when it’s 300km/h??
I only have one question: Why are they taking the potted flowers in the back? 🤔
Cool https://youtu.be/vO-vH7jQp6I
300kmh not 300mph
The launch control is so bad , iv seen people doing better in a chirom
Shane the speedo wasnt put into mph   It has the feature built in to do this
Click bait shit
Incredible engineering feat. Matt’s enthusiasm makes it.
Is this still available? Romans chapter 10 verse nine if you declare with your mouth Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead the Bible says you will be saved Jesus loves u
Wow...for you Tommy de vor iss over.
And bloody hell the guy driving is a ball of laughs hey?
Absolutely loved matts laugh as the car accelerated. Just laughed louder and louder 😂😂
He looks like a kid that has discovered chocolate for the first time 😋
Are those plants on the car?
This guy says this is a fastest car in the world(494 kmh)     FUN FACT:Koenigsegg have a koenigsegg jesko absolut(530 kmh)  SO????🤔🤔🤔🤔
"It could just be a 2 litre 4 cylinder" Mat says. It is, just multiplied by 4.
Future customer watching this...  😐
I was done watching when i saw the stupid masks.... @2:45
Yup...coź the title said as 300 mp/h though...i was expecting the bug hit 300 mp/h which is its forte actually..or maybe what matt meant how soon the bug will hit 300 km/h which is super fast!
😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
Engineer: Dont drive buggati Chiron Matt: dang It but ok Next we get to see Chiron's drag race
9:27 Koenigsegg Jesko hold my beer.
I think Christian having more fun than usual  :D
Anyone else super disappointed with the 300 "MPH" clickbait title? I love Carwow and M Watson videos, but this is 100+ MPH slower than the title. This is less than 20 MPH faster than I went in my 2002 WS6 Trans Am (massively quicker of course) almost 20  years ago. The car is sick, but really disappointed with the video title.
Bad form, Mat.  KPH!  Oy.  That would be CLICKBAIT.  And not the first.  No exclusive here.   This was a media event.  But what a ride!
Stick for the exhausts.....real they're!!!!
*the fact that the electronic speedo skips times, like bugatti, this is a 300MPH+ car, you would probably want to know your exact speed
300 KM/h no MPH bléééééé 😡😡😡
it took a year, but a prototype with a full interior and stuff is done! niceeeeee i freaking love how the SS300+ looks it just looks so insane
I think you meant 300 KMPH ?
🌟🌟😍😍😍❤❤👏👏👏
where is the stick of truth Matt?
The speedometer says 500. Chew on that for a bit.
How come supercar Blondie gets more privilege and they let her drive all these exclusive cars?
Come on carwow, fix the title, or I'll shall scream clickbait.. It's kmh not mph! Oh and how much can you save me on the price? Can't find it on the app...
I'll bet you shift a few of these on car wow now that you've done a vid on it. heh.
That’d be dope if CvK lets him in a Jesko Absolut to blow his mind even more
Wish he could have brought along his specialist timing gear💔😂😂❤️❤️
Are these sold out ? Do you need to be a former or current Bugatti customer to be eligible?
300 kmh not 300mph
You are the first after marchettino actually
Engineer so German andrelaxed
That was 300 km hr so it was actually 186mph
Mat's reaction says everything.
Any fake vents? 😂
So is the 300mph speculative? So far it was only tested on a banked test track at 300kph. Bugatti will never know what it is capable of until a customer does it lol.
Savage Matt👌👌
Pointless, where on earth is 300mph useable!
300mph, you mean kmph!
I love the plants they put in the back
185 MPH what a joke i could name 15 cars at least ten times less this price to reach that, even james may reached a higher top speed in the old one, I'm ashamed of myself for watching -1/9999999999
That Chiron makes 200-300 like my car 0-100....
Can i chip it for more power ?
"itz ze early steitch of ze developement!" Sounds like the stereotype German in an american Nazi film....Matt is soooo happy with 300+!
Koenigsegg Regera broke Bugatti’s record 0-400-0 km/h in 42 sec. It did it 31.49 sec. In 0-400 km/h it is 32.6 sec. - Bugatti vs 22.78 sec. - Koenigsegg. After that, there was just a deep quiet. This Chiron Super Sport is quick, but not so much to take that record back. Mainly because of the big and heavy engine, wich has to suck too much air. Does really anyone believe this Chiron Super Sport will be any better than Regera?
In the drivers seat: German Robot
I think the title has a bit of a typo, 300 kph rather than mph.
Doug de muro : *_sad noises_*
Why are there potted plants behind the seats?
my guy... those are the classic Bugatti road test rims, not the actual rims you'll get. Fail
The "When you go past 300 and then change gear" meme has to be replaced by "When you go past 400 kmh and THEN change gear"
Okay I'm confused, the speedometer shows it's kmph not mph. So 300mph is 480kmph that is huge difference. So is it kmph or mph in reality ?
Second one after Marchettino
The Chiron is running at 300kph and the engineer says that ( it is only the 2 third of what it can do ). I truly believe him. Just look at how the car jumps from 0 to 300.
Wow dude looks so weird in that thumbnail. Anyway as far as the car congrats to vw for building an even bigger and better version of that w16 for your multi million $ land yacht touring cars...sure goes fast in str8 line but what else??
300 km per hour, not mph
Did you know that South Korea has the smallest  average penis size in the world  ??   😁
Seeing Matt so excited while he has been reviewing cars for 20 years, makes me really happy
REMAC be like:  Bitch please ✌🏼🤣
son 300km/h 🙄
It's pretty special. I'd still rather have a 911 GT2 RS though.
Johann Krauss working as testdriver at Bugatti
Gutted !! 300kph 😂😂 not 300mph
Mate, I haven't seen you do excited every before. Normally I do not envy but this time I felt so envy :-). I must have been cosmic expierience. Super video Matt!
It's speed climbs so effortlessly
Matt losing it ... LOL
Like per chi viene dal video di Marchettino
I'm struggling to find this car on carwow... Wanted to see what discount was on offer
It does 300 quicker than my car does 100
What a tough job they both have.....  LUCKY ********* great video
300 km/h not 300mph
Nice! I really hope you'll be the first one to go in the Koenigsegg Gemera, Matt ! I wonder how different would the two cars feel.. Thanks. Keep 'em coming
that engineer is one cold, mean bastard.
Don't care so much about the top speed, that Matte Black is 🔥
The fastest production car will be the Tesla Roadster 😎👌
🤪 Terrible speed
Fastes car was an porsche 911 turbo s
Today i'm driving the oh.....oh no , no... i can't but stil very , very cool!  Gotta love this guy haha 😂
So 300kmh not 300mph? Anyway, doesn't matter, what matters is are the exhausts fake? Where's the Carwow Stick of Truth?
It’s going to be the fastest production car not the fastest car ever lmao
Koenigsegg better than bugatti
But what about boot capacity and infotainment system.
might wanna fix that title mate, kmh not mph.
100kph in first gear....
I’ve literally watch this video 10 times lol 😂  i love carwow’s videos they’re so good 😊
The guy who tester the car to make sure it’s working well: 👁👄👁
I would rather have a konigsegg Jesko absolut
I think there is difference between 300 mph & 300 kmph
Those plants on the rear parcel shelf need a drop of water. Bit dried out.
When will they get to 300mph....only saw 300km/h?
😹 😹 😹 Because this is work btw
covid isnt bad
3 Millon and there's no backseats.
Don't think this car will hold the record for much longer. The Koeniggseg Absolut will take the crown soon. Cant wait for that record run. Thank g-d for gravity (which creates g-force) so that we can have such fun. 7:20 is priceless lol.
Gotta love Mat😂❤️
Correction.  Fastest production car.
Is it just me but did the Bugatti engineer kinda seem really grumpy and not want to like deal with Matt or like taking him for a drive or anything
please do drag race
You could buy a house and a few Zondas, Ferraris and Lamborghini for that Bugatti...🤔...🏡🚗🚙🚘
The tyres will melt above 220mph...🤔
O to 60 in...same time I just said it...😂
It’s surprisingly slow below 80kph
Dont do go too fast...!!! Keep it below 200mph...😂🤣
How much can i save on a new bugatti :-D
That's not 300 mph but KM/H
I would like to see the fuel meter
This german accent of the engineer 😅
Speaking to him was like speaking to Google translate or Siri 😂
Christian: a comedian in a former life
Hi Mat, how much can I save on a Bugatti Chilton SS with car wow?
OMG THIS CAR ACTUALLY HAS SPEED HOLES FROM THE SIMPSONS
Audi
911 Turbo s is faster than a Tesla
Dude... You're damm funny. Love the channel
Which courses do I have study and where can I apply for the job Christian has ?
Heh, Mat says "614 horsepower" as the max hp used. Just missing a thousand. :D
Using masks😂 like what the hell. If neither has the virus....WHY.
The first 50 seemed kind of flat but holy crap it just leaps from 50 - 250km/h. Mental!
It’s doing 300kph not mph wtf I came here to see it doing 500kph not 300
Me when I see and get to drive this car: Oh wow  oh god  oh my Am I dreaming Is this real *faints*
Rumour has it the Chiron is capable of 600 miles per hour. But the French gave up halfway through.
300mph ? no its 300Kmph
So  question (obviously I have never driven any sportscar of any sort): If someone is rich and lucky enough to own this car and want to tour inside the city, would that mean that he can only drive in the first gear, since the car shifts into the second gear after 100 km/h?
🙄jdm fanboys : supra tuned can beat that
Race track: max 300km/h  German Autobahn: hold my beer
How cool is that driver 😎 No pink suitcase boot test Mat?
Could the exhausts be fake. Stick of truth? No testing of boot space or back seat amenities. Sad no parking attempt around town. Top5 annoying things? Bet the fuel economy might be a challenge.
You can't say it's 300mph! It is kph bruh...
How much we can save, buying this car through carwow again?
Can carwow get a better price for the supersport? Hard when there us but one UK dealer
It may be the fastest car made but it physically isn’t the fastest production car yet as there isn’t enough units of the car made for it to be classed as the fastest production car in history
I've never seen Mat Happy like that before...wow
Are these idiots in the comments even watching the video ~ the car is electronically limited to 300km but its capable of doing 300mph
300mph or 300 kmh?
agera is faster
Mat! The speedometer is in KPH!! It is a normal speed. What the hak!!
He just did 300kmph not mph.. I can do 300kmph on my bicycle.
At the end I thought he was going to say "want to know how much you can save on a new bugatti..." 😂😂😂
Amazing! Looks like Matt just had all his Christmases arrive at once 😂
Wouldn't keep up with the Porsche 992 Turbo S on Nürburgring
It seems slow from 0-100 :-D
Comes with two pot plants also, bargain
“More, more, more, more, more, more, more”
What about the flowerpots at the back window? Are they included in the price?
POKE        IT         WITH        A        STICK        :)
300mph 300kmh for now lol
Speedo increases faster than my cars revs
Third is the new First
0-300
Hi, in the title 300mph and on the film 300kmh what is this rubbish?
Why are there pot plants in the back windows?
5"21 Christian: Another school girl laugh like zat and he'z out of here!
300 km/h, not mph.
No you are not the first one faisal khan and super car blondie had already been here
I just want a car with a speedo that goes to 500!!!!
Take a shot every time Matt says “isn’t it”
Fact. there is going to be the second in list. fastest car incoming 2021. Chaos hyper car from greece.3,000 HP
Thank god Matt did not do a stick of truth test on a Bugatti 😂😂
KAZAKHSTAN 🇰🇿🇰🇿🇰🇿🇰🇿☝️👌
Clickbait title
I wonder how much we can save if we buy this through carwow
No matter how much money they save on this car.. I can't even afford the tyres of bugatti
Kinda disappointed hearing that the people who buy it are having their top speed limited. Likes spending that much money for the fastest car and not being allowed to use it
That was 300km/h, rite? Anyway amazing experience though...i think none of these  will land on KL
I thought the fastest car in the world was the jesko
Bruh clickbait.... 300kmh = 186mph😑
07:09   300 KPH NOT 300 MPH
So how much can I save on the Bugatti with the carwow app?
The engineer must be German. There’s no way he’s not.🤣
The wing in the back😍
If you buy this car, your bank account will be much lighter.
But they only did 300KPH... that’s a little less than 190mph.
This was fantastic!  I think Mat was reacting like most normal people would, with child like excitement.  Awesome.
Matt reviewing the Supersport on his own but because it's not a BMW:  "Headroom in the back is limitedddd, and there's no door pockets! Come on Bugatti.... "
My stoopid ass read 300 hp and was like da fuq
Wow thank you guys
Never heard so much laughter and joy from a grown man 🤣🤣🤣
300km/hr=186 mph
now with that price, imagine how much will it be in Singapore / Malaysia? 😂😭
OUTSIDE?
The title of the video says 300 MPH, the Speedometer says KPH.  That's a huge difference between going 300 kph and 300 mph.
I'm disappointed they did not go 300 MPH like they said they only went 300 kph really disappointed they only said that for views and click bait.
Yh but you only did leas than 190 mph I’ve done 190 in a M5???
The Bugatti does 300km/h+ like it’s nothing... pure force and power, awesome!
C'mon Bugatti,  Let Matt drive 😈
Mat: let's do it again Engineer: we've already done it twice Mat: *confused cat face*
Its Quickest not fastest
Бугатти
Can’t believe they’re driving 300 miles an hour with a MASK ON?!?!??!  thats so dangerous!!!!
300km/hr, not 300mph
the driver look so chill while matt is just screaming like a maniac
Matt in the bugatti: HAOOAHAHAOHAOHAOHAOHOAHOAHOAHAO The driver: 😐
300mph?
don't forget guys there is 4 roads width here it reduce the effect of acceleration and speed a lot... on a normal 1 road width it would feel completly out of this world, let's say next to some normal cars like Hyundai, Camry etc
Did you test the porsche tacon Turbo s and the new 911 Turbo s both faster then the tesla on video a week ago?
If anyone deserves this it’s Matt... brilliant
Imagine... Going at 500 kph.. He only went to 300 😳 . I want to experience that speed..
This is not car 🙂 💔
I always thought Bugatti is Italian but I recently found out it is in fact French 😳
Check out the pop banners to save about 1M euros on the buggati chiron Super sport
Am I the only one who feels clickbaited that he said he went 300 mph but it was only 186 mph and it was 300 kph 😡😡🤬
The 500km/h max on the speedometer is like the 130 on my Honda Civic, both are ridiculously impossible
Hearing Matt’s accent makes me miss watching Peaky Blinders.
0-100 kmh doesn’t appear to be anyway near as quick as I expected 🤯 But after that it’s in another league!
Don't press read more                                                                                                                                                                             you are adop- i mean the best parson alive 👍👍^_~
Its kmh not mph just saying we know its not clickbait .. or is it .......
More of a land based missile than a car
Looks like it has been outfitted with 2 flux capacitors.  One behind each seat.   I guess 1 just isn't enough.
I can’t stop watching it
I expected to see it at 300mph, not 300km / h
uhhhh u do realize that was in kph right..... not mph.......
Just rollin down the road going 300
Not 300mph 300kph
Why the title says 300mph when it's 300kmh ?🤔
The only way I could ever came close to one of these cars is if I'm reincarnated as a bug in my next life then this car slams me at 300 mph. Why am I even watching this...
7:58 Legend.      +1
I'm happy to see Matt so damn happy. You deserve it my man!
Responses from the engineer:  Robotic 🤖
It’s 300 km/h not miles pr hour
I hope everybody realizes that 300 km/hr equals 186 mph
Wrong title kph not mph
So who drove it outside?
That vs turbo s lmao
As fast as a chiron.
misleading title and respect points dropping fast.
At full power, can he drive round Nardo fast enough to turn back time? Perhaps this is how we could solve Covid...
French car😏
wow that's so fast 487kph wow
So a car does 480km/h but the person who buys it cannot reach it. After that we have a video that is just like any other motoring channel. Why didn't you use your gadget to see the zero to 60, why didn't you ask to see how it brakes and how fast it is to stop before the cone, even worse how fast is it from zero to 400? I tell you what this is, this is you getting payed (I'm sorry invited) by vw so could do a rubbish video!
It says 300mph in the title but 300kmh in the car
Sensational. Reached the tingly bit just watching this
0 to 300 in 10 sec
He's not saying it out loud, but deep down Matt's begging Christian von Koenigsegg to give him a call!!
uhhhhmm 300mp/h???? that was km/h
It's officially not the fastest car in the world. And you can't drive it cos you're too short lol.

Now this car is rare. Really rare! Let me break this down really quick... Ever heard of the rare 100 GTUs rx7s? Only 40 have ever been claimed and only 7 are confirmed at the time of this posting! Here are the rarest rx7 FC3S models: 1500 10AE Turbo models 1400 infini 1000 winning limited 150 final edition convertible 100 GTUs... out of that 100: 83 red on black 10 black on black 7 white on blue There was only 100 GTUs models created between 1989 and 1991. If you own one of these rare models sign your car up to the registry list here on any of the rotary forums!  There are rumors about a restamped GTUs model...  The entire origins GTUs owners thread on the rx7club was modified, icemarks claims deleted, registry list changed to have a confirmed section and the mods agree there are not enough GTUs models to have the restamped.  Icemark cites himself while making up the claims almost 20 years ago. 😆  There are no restamped GTUs models, only GTU. Stop spreading false information. There are only 100 GTUs models made, only 40ish have been claimed to have been found, only 7 have been confirmed!   https://www.rx7club.com/2nd-gen-general-discussion-323/very-rare-detail-fc-1129229/   If you have a real GTUs you can register it here!   https://www.mazdaforum.com/forum/mazda-rx-7-33/official-mazda-rx7-gtus-owners-club-thread-44477/
Believe it or not Matt is only the 2nd person after top gear to review this particular Bugatti and the 1st to passenger test drive it. Well done Carwow.
Won’t say fastest car in the world the jesko might beat it
It's not a production car yet, so.....
300 mp/h is not the same as 300km/h when you drive 300 mp/h it means that you are driving 500 km/h and the title say „300mp/h“ and the car is driving 300km/h only
Best acceleration 7:43 🤯 #power of buggati.
The fastes Volkswagen.😎
You didn't do 300 mph.  You did 300 kmh.  Title is incorrect. Big difference!
He only went 300 kmph = 188 mph 😂😂 Transits do that on the M way
Koenigsegg -> Hold my beer 🍺
Can you please review a land cruiser 2020 mbs
no comments about the plants in the engine bay? or did i just not read far enough?
186mph not 300mph
Very cool Mat, you deserve that experience!
Mat: the fast car from 0-60 I’ve been in is a tesla model s performance. Porsche 911: am i a joke to you?
How much can I save on the Chiron 300 through Carwow?
0-300 km/h..,........ 14 seconds? Whaaaaaaaat t f
Two things:  The speedometer said KPH, not MPH....did I miss something?  And why are they wearing masks? This is a reaction video.
Below 50 doesn’t seem to be accelerating quickly but above 50, the numbers just fly!
Why is there 2 pot plants in the back? 😂
Carwow Русская версия, срочно переведите этот выпуск. Я буду вам сильно благодарен этому
Sorry to say this But your not the first one to go in a Bugatti Chiron super sport
Matt, you title 300mph...IT IS 300 km/h....you nasty man😁..you are forgived...as we love you in france too... i would love you to try the AMG GT4 43....against other brands..Audi..BMW PLEASE
300 km/h not 300 mile\h
No sticks in the exhaust test on this? You coward!
Is it any good ?? I dont see   this brand on the streets ....
Bugatti ça nique tous les autres
Is this the Chiron SS 300+ 's prototype??  They haven't gone higher than 302 km/h
Nice Volkswagen....👀
Bro he’s not the first the German YOUTUBER Matthias Malmedi 👊🏿😂   Stop the 🧢
Goosebumps
You should review koenigsegg one 🖤
I thought that it is 300 km/h, bloody hell what a beast
Still loses to a boat on ice
next: Koenigsegg Jesko and Absolut
why give the exclusive to a man who's never been in a fast car and isn't even passionate about bugatti. smh
"Want to see how much you could save on a new Bugatti?...head over to Carwow!"
Almost all koenigseggs is faster Than that
300kph != 300mph, no?
Have to say when captain Slow did 240mph in Veyron that looked sick... 300mph is pure sci-fi in car with aircon stereo etc. Wow
CHAOS is coming
click bait!!! those are not 300mph, the title say MPH and  it is 300 km/h please change the title... Matt was really excited that forgot to think in KM
The Bugatti is so awesome and dynamic
300mph in the title of video should read 300kph.. tut tut but great video none the less
Come on Matt, at least pretend you're having fun!
why are there plants in the engine bay ?? ( i know its not plants :P it looks like it though)
무슨...300km를 내차 120km밟듯이 가네 ㄷㄷㄷ
I just noticed that Bugatti is so much faster than what they say. 1600 hp nooope it   1614  I think it actually 1700 HP
Matt is just a top bloke
Wow Matt I was right there with you!!! What a thrill!!!
One of the few ICE cars I'd like to experience 👍🏻
300 KMH NOT MPG
Matt you are a gem!
Does he mean 300 kilometers per hour
5000 G is crazy.
He is speaking like Niki lauda
Finally, I have got enough money to buy a BUGATTI magazine.
Grip was there before you
Tesla Roadster......hold my charge cable.
0-100 3,5s. second run very slow for such a car
i will take mercedes 😑
Pliss try 901 vs Bugatti
Your sexy voiceee
What a car😳😳
Yeah a Bugatti thats wasting you gas money lol
That manic laughter the first time he experiences it speaks volumes of him and the car
you go 300km not 300mph🤣
It's not a Caddy though is it. Go round a corner in the wet, then you'll say oooo sh=t!!
300kmph now mph
Its not 300 mph its 300 kmph
When are they going to finish painting it?
Congratulations awesome.
Matt you should put a Bugatti on a drag Race it Will be awesome
Anyone else see the plants behind the seats?
I can't tell if anyone noticed, but the title is mph, but he's going 300kph. Not nearly as impressive.
The ford gt 2005 make 305mph so is not the faster of the world
300 kilometers, its like 187 miles per hour not 300 mph 😑
Bro are those plants in the rear windows? Sure looks like plants.  Edit: Never mind they’re just a bunch of wires.
It's 300 km/h not mph
Is it just me or is that car crazy ugly
Kmh not mph big difference
You let yourself down then son,you acted like a teenager and your banter was equally childish.
Who we are? Carwow fans!  What do we want? A drag race between the Bugatti Chiron Supersport 300+ and the Tesla Model S P100D with Yianni!  When do we want it? Now!
corona mask propaganda actors !!!!   🤮🤮🤮
"I'm used to reviewing golfs" Can we applaud Matt's modesty
Sorry, thumbs Down for the Masks.  Do you want to be using this shit for the rest of your damned lives??
0:53 Matt's arms are lookin kinda big yknow
Why did you click bait us by saying 300 mph instead of 300 kmh
It is not the fastest car in the world ever
It’s insane the amount of power they’re able to squeeze out of the engine of this car. Like they got an extra 100hp! They added a whole NA Miata to it!
Matt, how much discount can I get on the Chiron Super Sport if I buy through the Carwow app?
A Koenigseg jesko is waaaaaay faster than that car
I thought mat was gunna drive ☹️
Looks like a lot of people can't read the title properly and differentiate between "in the 300mph Bugatti" and "doing 300mph in the Bugatti".
So, Mat you forgot to mention at the end - should we consider the Bugatti Chiron or shortlist it?
Time for a drag race?
Liers that's 300km/h not mph
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Small door bins. Infotainment system is fiddly too. Get a VW Golf.
М5 best car ever BMW.
F1 pilots reach 300 km/h like a thousand times on a single weekend, and they are like nothing really happened
It hit 100km/h in 1st gear, that is not normal
Why can I see potted plants in the rear windows?
Best CarWoW👍👍👍
He is your best journalist hands down, made me smile the whole way through, matt Watson should've been in top gear not those goons after the 3 legends were booted out
This time Matt cant say, save 2000 on carwow on this car 😂😂😂
Did he say 600hp?
Does the customer version also come with a choice of houseplants for the rear parcel shelves?
this buggati engineer is definitely a german ahhaha
No helmet no nothing? Well, that is trust..or the perception, that nothing will protect you in a 300mph crash, lol..
Luckiest human being on the planet  Why do the bumpers front and side look different from the actual one or it's my eyes???
🌞👌 ☆☆☆☆☆☆☆7Star... Lisbon Portugal
@5:11 the way you laughed describe perfectly the experience
When you realise he only hit 300 Kmph / 200 Mph 😑
So wheres the 300mph?
Wowwwwwww
You are not first
H2r be like am a joke to you?
300 km/h.
i mean its kinda clickbait cuz hes not even close to the 500kmh / 300mph
When the Buggati Launched Matt's Laugh Was soo Funny It made me Laugh 😂😭
"So what's my final verdict?"
Isn't it
Imagine the Koenigsegg then :)
He actually went 300km/h not 300mp/h which by any means is a Bugatti top speed or any world record.
Title is slight click bait but still a great video
Matt, how much can you save me on a Bugatti Chiron? You know what, don't bother with a reply!
Please, don't f**** talk rubish while acc.......
Matt just won an Oscar😘
Where are my Koenigsegg boys
300 KMh not MPh
In the VW factory in wolfsburg is a version of pure Silver or something. Like a giant mirror driving around. I have a picture of it
It is so quiet.
Utterly disappointed, misleading caption. It's 300kph, not 300mph
at max speed 5300G force in the tire!!! holy Shit! It makes dust caps weight 10kg on the tire! WTF?!!!
Do test drive at TESLA ROASTER 2020 !!! HOW MUCH WE MUST WAIT A JOKE FROM ELON MUSK????
Thank God it's Matt and not Cringy Supercar Blonde Edit: 😑😑😑😑 Edit again: That acceleration 🤯🤯🤯WTF!!!
It's a beautiful vehicle, but the title is click bait. Here in the states 300 km/h is just 180 mph which I've done on my ZX14R. Just saying with personal opinion.
thats 300 km/h not mph
1:54 It’s literally like they stuck an extended bumper to it looks awful you can see the gap between original and extended bumper. Spoiler in same spot etc
tellement magnifique !!!!
those are speed-holes; they make the car go faster
Koenigsegg is still faster.
How many times do I need to say this. The Koenigsegg is the world's fastest car
8:02 I tottlay agree matt 😢
Fun🎉👍👏
Who thinks he looks like Christian Bale..?
Mi car... Hits 90km/h Bugatti, wow that was 350km/h
It’s not 300 MPH it’s 300 KM/H !!!! That’s a huge difference.....
insane machine
Disliked for click bait, that was 300kph not mph...
Mat that is Awesome!!!
300 km/h not mp/h 😂😂😂😂
Disappointed. Not 300MPH, was KPH.  300KPH =186MPH
My dream car
And a koenig comes,and finish dream..😁
How expensive is it?
i really like to see mclaren 720s vs bugatti chiron super sport                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           who else want to see
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Speedometer says 300km/h. Title say 300mph. CLICKBAIT. Jkjk. Prob just a mess up. Dont hate me :(
"today we'll go at 300"  "miles per hour?"  "*kilometers"  "oh"
If you're wondering why this guy only says 'yes' than its because he WEIS what a PRÄZISE and EFFIZIENTE answer is. That's how we GERMANS like it. Bugatti is a part of Vw so it's a part of the DEUTSCHLAND
"It is the fastest car in the world" Supra: am i a joke to you?
How much can I save on this car with carwow? ;)
Nahhh. My civic with big turbo ant straight pipe could beat it on green
Colud you please add porsches 911 and lambo sv drage race
Theyre not even going 200mph, why  is he so happy?
Hey Matt, you maybe want to change title of video from 300mph to 300kph....
How much can you save on carwow for this car?
2:50 240 speed limit
Please correct me if I am wrong, but this is kmh NOT mph!
2:00 The reason they made the exhaust that way, is to fit a larger rear diffuser.
its not the fastest?
This car goes from 200 to 300 like my car goes from 0 to 60 damn! reminds you of your peasantry
I want drag race uhit bugatty cyron😲😍😃
At the end I expected Matt to say 'Go to Carwow.co.uk to find out how much you can save on a Bugatti from trusted dealers in your area.' LOL 🤣
EAT THIS SUPERCARBLONDIE
Excuse: the tires is the reason that we don´t do top speed
How many time the 0-100/0-200 ???
300km !!! not 300mph. You can clearly see in the speedometer it says km
300 kmh not mph.
the paintjob looks like someone plastidipped it
300mph is insane!!! Bet a mustang guy would still rev up at them sitting at a redlight
Where's the stick of truth?
Like everytime: Bugatti done it again, until Koenigsegg enters the chat and slams the table with something even more wicked performance.
I'd like to know what the test driver owns  as a daily driver. 👀
You use mask to prevent the infection of Coronavirus right ?
It really felt like a Japanese Shinkansen when it passed the cameras, a real bullet car this. 😅👍
The reason for the exhaust was inspired by the lightning jet which was F*cking rapid ...which suits the car too :)
300km not 300miles. Still impressive though
Here is to the T. rex of cars.... I meant king of cars
Is no one gonna say anything about the title? 300 mph when its actually Kmh
What a bad title for the video 🤦
The best video in 2020
Want to see how much you can save on a Bugatti, don’t bother
But the fastest car on carwow was the Porsche 911 Turbo S. It did 10.2
300 KPH is NOT 300 MPH
Easy~
I volunteer as a test passenger.
I will own this in 10 years. Gotta speak things into existence rt.
*Mechanical Engineering Masterpiece.*
It is not the fastest, the Koenigsegg Jesko Absolute is a few mph faster
6:31 jajaja
Matt’s childlike excitement here is just cute as hell.
He made it 10 time more fun. 🔥
So damn good it’s almost a Batmobile
Mat, the title says 300 MPH, and you only went 300 KPH. Please correct or I want my money back!
dont think turbo s is any slower in 0 100
A £41k Kawasaki H2R will accelerate as fast as that Bugatti.
Matt: i used to review Volkswagen golfs.
It’s not made for beauty? It’s very beautiful 4:16
Matt you actually look nice in shorts.   Ok, I'd like to see more videos of cars we could all actually afford. I drive a C7 Corvette, but Id like more realistic cars too.
Matt: “this is the new Bugatti supersport”  Doug be like: “Thisssssss iss the newwh bugattttiiihh ssuuppersportt”
Spoiler. Its was testing and it was electronically liimited at 300 KPH not MPH.  Simply a clickbait
Yes. You deserve this.
Its not 300mph.. it was 300kmph
Please move over!!!! Ahahahahhaha
I drew out a car just like this and I calculated all the horsepower and top speed and it was 350 wait 15-20 years
WTF is in the rear of the car..looks like a couple of boxes of old computer wires...could of hidden those:>)
It's diesel or petrol (gasoline) engine ?
So happy shmee didn't get this opportunity first
300km but still cool, and wait till you get in the koenigsegg jesko absolut
Your masks are blowing your own "exhausts" out side-ways, directly towards each other. Derp.
Good competition for Kawasaki Ninja h2r 😀👍🏻
*Koeningsegg Jesko Absolut Claims 532 km/h and Henessey Venom F5 Run over 500 km/h and Tustara Too*
The title is deceiving. It makes the viewers think that they will be going 300 mph not 300 kph
Not a 300 mph production car. It was a modified version of the car and it doesn't count because it is not a production car that ran 300 mph. NUFF SAID
That turbolag is hilarious
The main reason why I watch these. Videos is because Mat is soooo cute. And the cars are cool too
300kmh Bugatti
Clickbait he said 300mph it was 300kmh that’s a big difference
The shit Tesla isn't worthy of being mentioned in the Bugatti's presence.
That’s my dream car
Your title says "300mph" but is should be 300kph. Not quite the same be still very fast.
There is a difference from 300km/h (186mph) then 300mph (483 km/h). Good video, but a little click bait.
This is definitely going in a lifeofpalos video
Hopefully Mat learns how to wear his mask sometime soon...
Bro u only got till 300 kph not 300 mph
But was the infotainment system as good as those found in those such as Audi or BMW?
300 MPH is not 300 kmh !!!!!!!!!!!
Sorry but Kssoningen is best!
I was going to say, that's 300 Km/h not mph  - still incredible
Matt: Iam the first to go in the 300 mph/h in buggati chiron super sport Yanni:  you cheated 😂
the fastest car that you have been in is not the new porsche 911?
Went to Car Wow but not getting any deals through for this? Have a grand to put down too. What gives?
7:57  300 km/h But matt mentioned it 300 mp/h  Why matt? 😑😑
But is in km/h, not so impressive. Such a fake title.
Should of take a draggy in your pocket. So we can get some data.
300 km/hr not 300mph
There are a few journalists that got the car to do specs and stuff on
CLICKBAIT! He’s going 300 km/h not mph....
Really wow, WOW car!
Idiots. When they say 300mph but its only 300 kph 😂😂😂 obviously knew this was click bait
I thought the fastest he’s done the 1/4 mile was 10.1 in a 911 Turbo S not the Tesla? 🤔
Top Gear needs you
wdym 300mph on the speedometer it says km/h
Shit is getting hotwheels really fast
300kmph in that first corner what if it goes straight
No center caps and paint coming off the front lower grills
It may be the matte color, but honestly I don't like the design too much. I prefer the Pur Sport's track design.
Bugatti nice car
I think Matt is great but the UK is still on miles per hour. This was 300 kmph guys. Big difference. If it were miles per hour it'd be 482 kmph. They went 186 miles per hour. Still impressive but not what the title says.
This car is a beast

Matt, the way you laughed like a little school boy made me feel like I was right there with you. Thanks for the ride!
At least there is no need for the stick of truth! This looks amazing
No Carwow stick of truth on the exhausts? Pffft.
You can tell in his face. He wanted to shit his pants.
Do Koenigsegg
TESLA FAN: NOPE NOT FAST  BUGATTI FAN: IS FAST  TESLA FAN: NOPE NOPE 0-60 1.9 SEC BUGTTI: YUP THATS FAST OK MASTER
Mat Watson: Professional video title duper (fools thousands of people with tactical sentencing) - LIKE IF you didn't read the title properly like me! Haha
drag race coming soon? 👀
Also next time cud u tell us speed in mph
Matt your doing a great job lad youve came really far
We need Koegnigsegg Agera R vs Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse Drag Race Matt😢
Bugatti: Our fastest car ever? Koenigsegg: Hold my beer 🍻
How much can I save on that Chiron with CarWow?
*300kph ~186mph
Talkin about gettin thrown back into your seat
You have mentioned 300mph in video title, but it is 300kmph
Kilometer/hour not Miles per hour
Was this same car in fast 7 when they jumped tower to tower
300kph not mph
300kph
It’s got speed holes
Der deutsche hat ja nen richtig Baba Job bin Arbeitslos nimm mich mal mit !
Face masks 😂 like trying to stop the smell of a fart wearing underwear 😂 it doesn't help, the odour still escapes because the particles are microscopic and so are viruses!!   If there really was an AIRBORNE deadly virus flying around, those  silly face masks and staying 2 metres apart WON'T do shit to stop the virus but thick people still follow the government like as if they're god 😂  Wearing a face fask is idiotic guidance NOT law 😂  Everyone loves their own life and don't want to die so if there really was an AIRBORNE virus flying around, immoral government officials would be first to go into their underground shelters to escape the virus but have any of them done that????  No but Why on earth not after all, a DEADLY AIRBORNE VIRUS has consumed the world right?  Utter garbage and Matt is a fool to endorse this covid 19 scam
It's simply amazing sigh
Can you do a drag race In that plssss
Brilliant Mat, shame your mum wasn't there too.
Negative review of Carwow... can’t believe they can’t offer a saving of £3,480,000.00 on this car. I expect better offers, Matt and Carwow staff!
What clickbait. You only did 187mph, nowhere near 300mph. My old MR2 could do 187mph
WTH 300 KPH is NOT 300 mph. What a huge lie.  Like any respectable supercar and sports car can do 300kph.
German driver 💪🏾
Matt, ur title says 300mph ..its a 300kmph ride unlike the title says..
The fact that i will probably die without experiencing this makes me appreciate videos like this
Clickbait as hell btw🤣🤣
Guys I bet you didn't know this but                The driver did not have his seat  belt on lmao
The fastest car u driven in a 1/4 mile was the 992 Turbo S right? Not the Tesla model down
300 mph ??
Is it possible to accelerate so hard in a car that your lungs collapse?🤔
All the dislikes are coming from koenigsegg fans     They are sooo jellous because bugatti is best
Why do sportscars have ugly interiors? Especially Bugatti..
"Let's do that again, I have forgotten how it feels like" I see what you did there Mr Carwow :)
I will buy this car in my dream 😂😂😂
Now this is the true definition of unaffordable, makes Ferrari and Lamborghini like budget cars
Click bait...
must feel amazing to of been the land speed record guys, just see everything blaze past
Er... 300 KMH..... not MPH as the title suggests.. you do know the difference at CarWOW I assume.... it won't do 300 MPH.. Perhaps they'll let other journalists drive it..
reasing the tittle made my head hurt
I want to drive one in M25😄
Engineer: yep and yes
Kmph*
This is so niceeeeee to sit in a bugatti,love ya mat watson
One of the worst car channels around
2nd fastest, (Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut, 330 mph) but yeah EPIC  Can run on four cylinders, (Koenigsegg Gemera, 250 mph with a 3 cylinder engine) but yeah EPIC
300kph = 180mph not so impressive in miles per hour!
nobody else like me thought to watch Mat driving @ 300mph?
300km/h  IS NOT THE SAME WAT 300mph. ehhhhh
300 MPH but only did 300 KMPH
bugatti chiron 300 mph 😂😂😂  bugatti chiron 500 mph 😱😱😱
bugatti chiron 300 mph 😂😂😂  bugatti chiron 500 mph 😱😱😱
Not 300 mph it's 300 kmh
Remember when James May actually held the top speed record for a bit in the Veyron? 😂😂 I thought that would be Matt this time
Title is a bit misleading, there is a big difference between 300mph and 300kph
🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵
Matt didn’t tell us what we can save on the new Chiron at Carwow, and he forgot the „specialist timing gear“
I love matt
There is a tiny little difference between 300 MPH and KM/H ...  Still a fucking great video of an awesome car. That is somewhere in the 3 second range from 100-200 km/h which is insane!
The test drivers accent sounds so freaking german haha
How much can I save on a bugatti chiron through carwow?? 😂
Bugatti: “We’ve done it, we have the fastest car”.   Christian Von Koensegiegg: “hold my beer”
This car is a beast literally!! Amazing👍👍
The title of the video says 300mph but this is 300km. Pretty big difference and pretty misleading
Anyone else seeing plants in the back windows of the bugatti
Dear Santa
Imagine if Matt said, “Want to see how much you can save on a Bugatti Chiron Super Sport? Click on pop-out banner to see Carwow’s best deals.”
Koenigsegg Just needs to Finish the Jesko
This engineer is so very German. :)
Check your video at 5:22 and look at the Speedo, it says clearly  300 Km/h!
All I can say Matt is you lucky lucky Bar Steward!!
so what's the 0-300 km/h time? Matt: HAHAHAHA!
Surprised I can’t see any comments about how the title says 300mph when it was 300kmh
Want to see how much you can save on a Bugatti Chiron SS 300+ Head to carwow to get deals from our trusted dealers. . . . . Matt didn't say that.
5.09...when Matt puts his arms out....you know the shit just go real
Mat could you do a review on the latest mazda mx-5 rf
I was waiting to see how much I could save thorough the carwow app. Disappointed 😂
In this case, I don't mind being "that guy". With that said, this specific car has not been tested at 300+mph, the top speed of this car is unknown at this time.   As for the 300 mph "record" Bugatti broke, they have not broken any record, as of typing this the Koenigsegg Agera RS still retains the title.   The specific car Bugatti tested was not a production car in any manner, it was a test mule, which means it is disingenuous to claim "300 mph", but this applies to anyone who makes this claim.   IF Bugatti are handed this record by Guinness then the title will effectively be worthless and will be a repeat of the Veyron SS and the limiter they deprogrammed. Remember, customer cars weren't capable of the recorded 267 mph, they maxed out at 257  mph or so. IF it were possible to deprogram the limiter by Bugatti then it still wouldn't be a feature  present at time of production which means it would still not qualify for the record.   Feel free to present your arguments...
Whats more brutal...this or the white 1000hp supra you tested ?
You are lucky man
Mph?  Maybe km/h?
2028: Dad, why are they wearing masks in a 2 seater car? was one of them a surgeon? Dad: No son, for a short while everyone pretended that if they wore masks they would be protected from a virus that escaped a level 4 biolab
frer tu menh
300 kmh not mph CLICK BATE haha
pk tu rigol frer
Any carwow discount on this one?
Matt...what about the carwow stick of truth test?
This is the most useless, most desirable thing in the world
300kph not mph
It felt like tesla😆
Matt, have come down to earth, yet?
Pls poke it with a stick
venom gt is the fastest car is the world
Laughing like the joker lol
Sold out already? Was about to buy one, dam.
The car stands still, the engine moves the planet 😂
zee germans are coming! 😉😂
"Want to see how much you can save on a new Bugatti Chiron Supersport? Click the carwow logo in the top right."
We all know mat shit himself when it launched
Who remembers watching when James may Richard Hammond and Jeremy Clarkson racing on that track and they were crying 😂
I’m not quite sure..... but does matt know this is in KPH not MPH ? Lol
RUSH E
Matt with the W ,Congrats mate
Never seen Matt so happy 😂
1:53 been waiting for the stick of truth on that car
All the time I thought it was in mph :(
why is the speedometer in km/h but the title mph?
You watch a video about a Bugatti and about 95% of the time the only thing you see is two men talking to each other. What do you think is interesting about that?  Save the camera work next time and make a pure sound recording to carry the same information.
Looks like there’s two indoor plants behind Matt and the driver 😂🌿
A Tesla roadster is way faster  Who prefers Tesla roadster than Bugatti chiron 0 to 60 mph in 1.9 seconds Tesla roadster  2.2 second 0 to 60 mph buggati  chiron
It must be very exciting to experience a 0 to 300mph launch in Chiron. But I can't figure out what's funny there. Usually a person screams or stiffens with a facial expression as his "colon content" freeze. But Matt’s reaction is really specific. At the start, he folded his arms like praying to God to guard him a little better for the next minute. Up to 199 just seriousness and silence. At 200mph he starts laughing as he has just heard the best joke this year. :)
This is the first truly beautiful Bugatti
300km/h*
that's NOT 300mph....
Bugtti devo is the most exclusive
This Bugatti driver is less talkative than the stig
Mph??? Or km ???????
All fun untill you realise 80% of the time your going the same speed as the balti house Toyota yaris
Matt should we avoid it,shortlist it or go ahead and buy it? Am asking for future self and neighbors.
Why are there plants in the two back windows ? 😅😂
This car seem to be the fastest car in the world
3:55  Precisely why I do not love the chiron It iterally feels like ANY OTHER CAR i love the emgineering and I love it for what it stands for  But the fastest car in the world feeling like any other caar  Nahhh I'd have a Huayra BC
300 kmph not mph
Super sexy car man
Whats with the pot plants on the parcel shelf
Spoiler alert more like 300km/h 😒
And now have a go in a koenigsegg Matt to take it to the next level! 👍
What a beautiful beast!  When you can blow the mind of someone like Mat, you know the car is something special.
Coasting at 200 like you doing 20 in the neighborhood
giggles like a little girl .. Matt your so cute .
U need to drag a Bugatti....any Bugatti....asap
how much money we can save through CARWOW on this Buggati?
“Yes” 😅
Did this car feel faster than the 2021 911 turbo s ?
The title is a lot clickbaity as you went 300KPH not 300MPH big difference...
Just curious: what's the time fir a standing 1/4 mile?
You almost got into the 200MPH club which cars have been stuck around for decades... Can't wait for you to hopefully be one of the few in the 300MPH club when the car releases and you show us what 300MPH is like outside of one off world record cars.
Why does he sound like Bottas?
DISAPPOINTED!! Matt, you didn't tell:      Should I avoid it? Should I consider it? Should I shortlist it? Or should I just go ahead and buy the Bugatti Chiron Super Sport?
Koenisegg: are kidding me?
I had the same hysterical laughter when I did a couple of rounds of drifting in Vegas (with a pro driver) and that was obviously nowhere near 300 km/h.
Meh.
Wow 🤩
What were those plants in the rear? Is this the fastest green house?
😄😆😂🤣 I love the thumbnail picture ❤🤣
What a world we live in where we can call a Chiron "Normal" 😂😂😂😂
👍 Mat
Bruh seriously the mask though...
At the end I thought mat was going to say “want to see how much you can save off a new Bugatti super sport 300+?”
you lucky geezer
the engineer is a german, i can tell by how he speaks
I've got a white one coming
koenigsegg is making jesko absolut that will go 330 mph.
The title says 300mph, in the video the driver says 300kmh, which was it? Watched again, speedo, says 300kmh, so title is wrong, so the mph is actually 186.411!
Disappointed you didn’t ram a stick up the exhaust pipes.
300 MPH matt, really? Tut tut :D
Im confused isn't 300km/h plus or the title says 300mph...coz i saw in ODO KM/H?
Botswana
Matt giggling like a 5 year old during that first acceleration run was excellent 😆
i want to go in one =(            Plzz Bugatti =)
jesko Absolut is there !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
thats 300 KMH
KPH
While testing the car... Engineer: Drives the car fast Mat: HOHOHOHOHAHAHAHAOHOHOHAHOHOAHOHOAHOAHOA Engineer: Have you not been in a Bugatti before
I love how Christian looks expressionless covered with a mask and sunglasses.
It was 300km/h and not 300mph
Mat: Driving to the actually test drive itself... it just feels like a *normal car* Me: Like everyone owns one
300 kmh not 300 mph.... big difference
cAusE He HaSnT BeeN in  A suPra...
I didn't see 300 mph...he's a mousy little twit isn't he?
0:27  Mat: *cries*
The koneggseg Jesko is faster
every car nut should be able to experience this
Stig when he learned to speak
The testdriver is the german we all expected him to be
"Isn't it?", "Aren't you?", "Don't they?", "Is it?", "won't they?"... Every other sentence ends with one of these. You need to work on that
I love how the position of the 100 km/h on the speedometer is the same as the position of the 40 km/h indicator in my Honda City hahaha
300Km/h not Mp/h
So how much can you save on one of these if you buy it through CarWow?
I came here for 300mph not kph.  Wow.  Never thought this channel would be click bait.  Disappointed.  300kph is nothing in a car.  I do that on my motorcycle often
At the end I tought Mat was gonna say '' wanna see how much you can save on a new Bugatti '' 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
So what exactly happened?
Non cliccare    1 like = 1 ora di fortuna ❤️  1 iscrizione = fortuna per sempre ❤️ Niente = sfortuna per sempre 💔     Andate a guardare il mio ultimo video pls❣️?
Was expecting the carwow ad to say "Want to see how much you can save on a Bugatti Supersport...".
This car can do 200-300kmh twice as fast as my car doing 0-100kmh
Thats km/h actually.
But it wasn't 300mph. It was 300kmh
Those damn annoying masks
It really is a truly impressive work of ART
Title: 300mph Video: 300km/h
wait is it 300kmph or 300mph
Buggati race with other cars bro
Next up on Koenigsegg Jesko please! 🙏👍🔥💪😂
I wonder how much more thrust or wing would be needed to make this fly. It goes a lot faster than some planes at lift off it seems!
This is batmobil
Km/h not mph/h
Is it just me?  What are those two plants doing in the back of the car!!!!???? 😂🤔🙈
I swear it looked like it did 50->100 in half the time it took to do 0->50!  Loved the giggles :)
So where will you be able to do 300mph? My local A road only allows 70mph.
All I can think is that these cars will end up being museum pieces because they will be too valuable to drive. That they will rarely be used at the speeds they were designed for. Reminds me of a friends £8,000 sofa that no one was allowed to sit on.
Bro what about koenigsegg Gamera, agera or Jesko!!!
The funny thing about it..he just go 300km/h not MPH
I mean 300mph would actually mean more than 480 kmh ... the title is confusing
engineer is dense , like the transmission fluid of this chiron
l have a feeling something went wrong at koenigsegg facility, they're kinda late,
nice Matt!
Wow this is such a clickbait...
Nice car Matt but you didn't say how much we can save through Carwow.co.uk
What are the five annoying things about it? And what's your final verdict ? What's the best trim configuration on carwow app ?  You've changed
Brilliant. Words fail me.
If you need company for your boring days at work I’d happily come along.
Just want to say....the driver look like Sebastian without hair
they went 300km/hr not 300mph like the title says, disappointed lol.
The lack of drag on that revised bodywork can be seen the way it goes from 200-300. Insane. And it looks even better than a regular Chiron - lengthening the tail has really made it look lean and sleek and hides it's actual size. The rear 3 quarter view is the best view of any Chiron out there IMHO.
Please like this comment so Christian can know how bland and uninteresting he was acting... Matt was so excited:(
0-100 in about 3 s but i think without heavy start. but 100-200 in 3 s... WTF...
Hello
Cis
The title is wrong. 300km/h isn't 300mph...great to see Mat having so much fun though
How that driver talks reminds me a lot of Niki Lauda!
Nobody:  Literally nobody  The engineer: *YES*
Kid in a very big sweet shop
Lel
Lul
His German accent
Am I the only one who noticed that the speedo showed 300km/hr while the caption says miles per hour..? Why is that so?
300mph or 300kmh??
What an amazing experience. The things you have to endure for work 🤗
Reviewing a corsa next lol
This the 1st time Bugatti made good looking car
Love this show just hate how he has to slap, rub and poke everything always like as if someone who buys a Ferrari will do that...
Matt  What a Superb opportunity!!!     can you get it on pcp..lol
the driver is definitely a german. wow he sounds so german. i love it
300mph = 482.803 kmph 300kmph = 186.411 mph  Nice Clickbait. World exclusive my foot. SMH
So the title is a lie? You didn't go 300mph?
what about koienesseg jesko absolute? mat watson
the chaos is faster bro
Well he did 303kph, not 300mph. Did I miss something?
It was kph, not mph. Huge difference 😕
3.5 million euros. 2 euros Seat rear view mirror
But but, how much can i save on one through carwow?  And should i avoid it? Consider it? Shortlist it? Or just go ahead and buy it? So many unanswered questions
Did anyone else fall asleep whenever the driver opened his mouth
Christian: We have limited speed for the tires, there is a speed limit here. Max (from @AutoTopNL): Hold my beer...
He is like a child In a Candy Store....wants one more time again and again
Any link with offers buying via Carwow ?
that is 300 km not 300m
В поисках русских
Didn't go in with the stick of truth this time 🤣🤣🤣
Is Christian German? Just wondering lol
For some reason I want to see the reaction of KSI at 300km/h
3.4 mil and no tow hook
its 300kmph not mph
300mph or 300km/k ?
Ματτ this is your chance  to win  Yianni!!! Don't miss it!!
Matt's laugh ... brilliant!
Take that you Supercar redhead
Matt: Speaks anything  Engineer: Yes!
Matt talk to koenigsegg and have them take you for a 0-400-0 run
Koenigsegg Jesko is faster 😊
More like 300 kph, not 300 mph Still awesome Video👍🏻
So why title says 300 mph when they've done only 300 km/h?
I thought the first person to get a ride in the Chiron Super Sports would have been Shmee150
Later on Matt snuck back to poke it with a stick  and search for hard plastic bits to scratch...
50 to 150 CHF > 1 sec.... damn
I was wanting to see how much I can save on this Bugatti through carwow 😔😔
Lucky man!!!!
So 200bhp per litre to do 300mph, that’s surprisingly understressed if you think about it. Most modern litre sports bikes put out a higher horsepower per litre than that. MotoGP bikes are around 250bhp per litre and F1 cars for comparison are around 590bhp per litre. The engineering that goes into Bugatti cars is incredible.
Change into 2nd Gear at 110 km/h 😬
what happened to the front grills
Mats logic: drag race this against a g wagon
You only did 186 miles p/h . What is all the fuzz about ?
Someone forgot about the Koenigseggs. Would love to see them go head to head. Especially the Jesko. The Jesko Absolute is capable of 300+ as well, and I wouldn't be surprised if it accelerates even harder than this. Can't wait.
Awesome stuff! Hope you get to show us the tesla roadster when it's out.
who else wanted to see matt poke that 3 million dollar car with a stick  i know i did
When Mat mentioned it's not 1500hp but 1600hp instead, the autogenerated subtitle lost it because it couldn't believe what it just heard 🤣
Really?? Face masks...? Ones that offer 0 filtration for bacteria? Nice one idiots.
Koenigsegg : hold my jesko beer
purest "'BLOODY HELL" i have ever heard
like for a dragrace
Where is the stick? ;)
Huh!! No stick of truth today 😢😁
I love this guy man!!! `when I grow up, I want to be just like him!! we need more Matts in this world!
Is the title of fastest car not with Koenigsegg?
So what exactly happened...
WOW, Amazing. So lucky Matt.
Pretty impressive stuff Matt
The car still doesn't have an official record because Bugatti wouldn't go the other way because it most likely doesn't get an average of 300mph
I like that excitement of matt
When they first took off, I thought Mat was auditioning for his part as the Joker... 😂. Great video.
as Matt says "Lucky bugger"!!
lolololol
People who dislikes are just jealous
Hi mat. That was fun.. could you do a review on the agera rs?
Officially it isn't the fastest car in the world, because Bugatti cba to test it in both directions.
95 kph and still on first gear. Amazing!
Mat I didn't see you using the 'stick of truth' to see if the exhaust pipes were real or not 😉
They should have one at Disneyland..
What a way to lose the bugatti-ginity
The car went 300 kmph not 300 mph
Swedish car has the record, you are a dumb ass saying mph when this is km/hr!!!!
300 miles per hour my ass you clown.  That is km!!!!!! thats only 186.  Hell a low end car can go 120.
His voice is too squeaky for tests like this.
Where’s the car wow stick of truth?
Congratulation Matt - History first guy in the 300+
No carwow fake exhaust test !
Unbelievable u are in bugatti😝😝
Who else noticed that it was at 100 only in 1st GEAR itself. Bloody hell 1st gear
I miss the stick of truth!
Come on Matt, tell us the truth.. you did drive this off camera 😂
You are the Luckyest person in this world
you should make a drag race with that bugatti chiron
What an amazing car
I really wanted to see matt driving it.  not fair Bugatti
Do a drag race with it please
Who else was wondering what those pieces of tape things were above the headlight?
Koenigsegg flies by... We need to edit that out
The car can achieve more than 300km/h 😱
No stick of truth test needed?
Matt you need to do it on motorcycle to feel what tht sort of speed feels like! 😆
Would still prefer any McLaren over this Bugatti
Koenigsegg enters the chat
When u buy a private jet that sticks on the ground.
soooo 300 km/h  yes?  the title says 300 MPH...so not that....its kilometers.  SOO 300 km/h is about 190 MPH...
kinda irritating seeing you so excited although u 've tried many cars. behaved unprofessionally. literally u weren`t boss but little son of the engineer
Koenisegg jescko absolute
2:02 in Bugatti website " it increased aerodynamics to make the exhaust like that "
do a drag race between tesla model s p100 d  porshe taycan ercedes sls electric
The EPIC moment has arrived 🚀 Incredible Bugatti‼️
Totally deserved Mat, your kid' big heart side is fullfilled man
Seems a bit sluggish off the mark. Drag race - Bugatti Chiron vs Hennessey Venom F5
Matt you should’ve invited Yani with whatever excuse he could bring alongside the Bugatti on a 0 to warp speed challenge.
bugatti is da best, maybe someday tesla will catch up
It was 300kmh not mph,
Realmente incrível melhor vídeo de todos.parabens.
I weirdly feel hapy for Matt feeling happy :P
That's a huge step Matt, now we'll be seeing hypercars on carwow, I hope to see koniggseg & McLaren p1 soon...
So what acautly happend?
Does anyone know why there are pot plants in the rear window?
Matt are you sure you're in the car as a journalist or actually as the owner
The Koenigsegg jesko absolut did 310mph
This engineer is a robot..
Man that guy could have just let Mat drive for a while i mean he is a car reviewer😕😔
3:03 are those fake plants ?
Where's car wows stick of truth? 😂😂😂
Bugatti ayy keep the best for themselves, the Chiron Ss that break the world record is much longer and looks better, this is just the Bugatti Chiron with a SS bodykit 😂🤣
Oh not even you now wearing the stupid mask ffs
Imagine taking it in an Autobhan :D
How much power do you want in the Chiron Super Sport?  Bugatti- Yes.
hope you get to go in a koenigsegg to compare to this!! produced just 18 miles from where i live :D
hes thrilled. and yet hes not much over half this top speed. still had another 120 mph to go!!
Matt I was waiting to give us an amazing deal for this car..! :D :D :D
Tesla at 250kmph: *morning breeze* Bugatti at 250kmph: *FOOKIN JET IS FLYING BY*
Mat's going to want to get into all the hypercars now....and they're all not going to be better than a Bugatti Chiron Super Sport
Looks like a couple of house plants on the window shelf behind them?  (Distibutos multifloorer I think)
You spelled km/h wrong.
But bugatti will not hold the trophie for the fastest in the for a long time thre are bigger cars coming example ( jesko absolute , hennesey vonem , mclaren speedtail and more...)
Wow finally matt, after a lot of request u finally featured Bugatti Chiron🔥🔥🔥
i also have a bugatti chiron at my home, it has a wheel base of 10mm , is  mat black. bought it from carefour.
Yet another car none of us can afford. This guy is a joke !!!!
Is that a PLANT in the rear window !?
I'll admit I was never a fan of the way the Veyron looked. It was a bit too bloated looking. While this car definitely still doesn't hide it's size all that much better, they have managed to dress it up much better. it's miles beyond the Veyron in the looks. At least the gloss painted ones they've shown. This engineering sample is a bit rough on the edges, but does have some unique and cool goodies like the uprated brakes, 100 extra HP, Magnesium wheels, and special made tires to handle 300 MPH without exploding or melting. The production version actually looks very nice. Having said that, unless Tik Tok, Youtube, Twitch, etc; is going to make me rich, I'll probably never be able to drive one of these or even touch one...lolol. Still, a person can dream. :P
Wow wow wow
Be aware of the plants sitting behind the headrest
You can save up to 4.000£ on CarWow buying this car.
ciao man you are the first because you the best in the world my mama 79 year old italian  lady say you are molto simpatico
Next video "review no 1 in Indonesia ,Toyota Avanza
You can’t meet your hero’s, like you said everything else will always be slow now
Chew on that Supercar Blondie! 😝
Coba yang nge review fitra eri hahaha
que experiencia, deberias de probar la aceleracion de mi dacia Sandero
I wonder how much I can save for one of these through carwow.
LOVE TO SEE IT AGAINST A 991 PORSCHE
Those plants in the back of the car :'D
That turbo lag tho... tesla would eat that alive. But top speed it takes the cake
Its mind blowing how a 1600 bhp car breaches the 300kmph mark like its fucking nothing.
matt i suggest you for a tug of war with tesla model x vs mercedes g63 aka matt's car because why not?
How much discount will carwow give  tho ?
Disappointed to see there was no stick test on the exhaust 😂
Ti sei cagato addosso...
300kmph not mph
whats all those ugly wires in the back??/
Is it 300km/h or 300mph? Speedometer is in km/h!?
Amacing. :) :) :)
Gosh, this is my last wish before i die💫
Honestly, it makes me so happy to see Mat this happy and excited 😊
fastest car in the world... dragrace against... hmm
Wheres that 300 mph?
Matt where is your line”you can actually save 5,000£ on the carwow website”
Are those plants in the rear windows?!
300mph ?
Plzzz do drag race of bmw x5 2020
What were the offers given  How much can we save by choosing the best offer providing  dealer!
Are those plants in the back through the Windows? 😯
I doubt this is actually the fastest car in the world. But we'll see. And honestly its so ugly, especially those ugly ass wheels
Its not the fastest i wached a video where a buggati from 0-400-0mph
It’s on kilometers not mph he said 300mph 🧐😬
You should definitely use that in a race
Bugatti :300 MPH.  Mat: so then, what exactly happened 🤨
Koenigsegg: hold my camera...let me introduce to you my Koenigsegg jesko absolute
That Color is 🔥
do a bugatti verrón review
Click bait title. They did not go 300 MPH.
I thought Matt was gonna say " How much you want to save on a Bugatti?"
He really said "what a way to lose your Bugatti cherry".....
Feel like tesla but still going to 303 kmh...that insane
Matt where was your stick to see if the exhausts were real?
typo.. its not 300mph.. its 30KMPH
2:48 Bugatti clockwork orange edition.
Fix the title. That's 300KMH, not 300MPH. :)
7:56 😭😭👍
It was 300 km/h not mph 😝
What a privilege! Thank you Mat.
Mph? 🙄
"Dammit Mat, I'm an Engineer, not a TV Presenter" 🤣
I'd like to see a race between this loosing against a jesko
Was that filmed on the circuit of nardo in italy?
Where is the 300mph footage ?
YES!!
WARNING ITS CLICKBAIT
That driver is a complete drip lol good luck matt
Now Matt will feel Laferrari like grannies cart.
finally he is in Bugatti
Didn’t go both ways to TECHNICALLY it’s not the fastest. Sorry not sorry
Your the first man to ever buy rhe bugatti chiron ss 300+ yeeeey you are great have a great day matt 😊😊
Coincidence that today in engineering I was learning about how a average 8 month year old becomes 56kg in less the a second in a crash from like 100kmh into a wall
Even a jesko track, not absolut version could be faster than this
Matt said the fastest quarter mile he has done is in Tesla with 10.4 sec but what about 10.1 sec in Porsche 911 turbo s
This was disappointing
Youre not the first. Mathias Malmedie was first
Crazy
Move over lol
Lie there is a car faster that it lol
How much can I save on a new Bugatti at carwow?
The Koenigsegg Absolut is coming for that Bugatti!
Feeling sad for matt 😂😂
The fastest you've driven is the porsche 911 turbo S dude.
Never Seen mat watson so scared in a car🤣
I can feel how happy matt is when he realized, the car was at 300km/hr
i feel sad as i am a lambo boy but this car is a legend
Matt laughing shows how insane that engine is
That's not 300 mph it's 300 kmph!🙄
That's how you lose your virginity.
300 mph my ass it’s 300 kph what a prank
Viva la France... Bugatti is a French brand.
damn click baited 300 kph not mph big difference
300 *km/h*
its the fastest car until a koenigsegg shows up then its all over
@5:12 pure maniacal joy!!!
So how much can we save buying this using the carwow app?
It's 300kph
My revmeter does not climb as fast as that sppedometer :)))))
Mat why didn't you drive it.......
And he went that fast wearing shorts...
no the fastest car in the world is the Keniggseg jesko absolute
Matt:- Teletubbies Chris:- Yes Matt:- Tweenies Chris:- Yes Matt:- See what i did there? Chris:- Well the weight distribution of Teletubbies vs Tweenies is very different due to the angle of the track and the wear.  Matt:- 😳
Lol he’s so happy
at the beggining of the acceleration you can actually hear how the boost start to built up, and thats the most beautifull feeling.
Koenigsegg Jesko
This Christian guy is the most German person in existence
This engineer dude is so grumpy. Typical
It is notthe fastest car ever though lol
I absolutely fell in love with the way Mat was so excited and was laughing like a lunatic 😂😂
WHY DID MATT NOT GET HIS SPECIALIST TIMING GEAR?!
9:51 ... i was expecting him to say "want to see how much you can save on a new BUGATTI CHIRON SUPER SPORT"
Cool
I didn’t know kph and mph is the same thing?
Dodge demon has entered the chat*
Sounds like a Jet departing when it passed the track😱
Are those two house plants in the back two windows (when you see the interior driving shots)
you mean KPH? lol what a joke
buy a new car？bugatti？ no，even with carwow discount，still cant afford one
The man driving the car didn't seem much interested to me dunno why 🤷
mPH,  KMH?
So what deal can i get on it on carwow?
No Carwow stick of truth?! You’ve changed Matt! 😂
I have observed so many times that the microphone seems weak, Matt's voice fades away. Kindly fix this issue, otherwise, love your content!!
Plot twist-car is a paid actor and speedometer is making you fool.
Wait for the jesko
This should be titled “First youtuber to do 186mph in a 300mph Bugatti” come on its so misleading. You’re talking in the video as if you’re doing the full 300mph. 🙃🙃🙃
I think he meant 300kmph
when matt said," its very compact in here" ,he is really is saying ," I think I might shatt myself and might get a bit stinky in here"
It's 300 kmph and not mph.... See the speedometer it's written thete
Title update: 300kmh not 300mph
OK matt now involve a Chiron in your drag races!..;
It looks really weird
Its 300kmph....not 300mph🤷
I think turbo S is faster than model S .. I know taycan for sure IS
Im just curious, what are those things that look like a plant in a plantbox on the rear windows?
OMG 😱🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Which part shows 300mph?
gotta see this matt
i know buggati is fastest but i dont like it i like tesla roadster 2020 which will be quickest car to take against buggati chiron super sport and lamborghini huracan performante because roadster takes 0-60mph in 1.9seconds. so challenge buggati chiron 300+ diesel vs tesla roadster 2020 electric. i bet roadster will win
Chey, I thought Matt was the one driving it.
Bugatti Chiron SS vs Koenigsegg Jesko - Drag Race MAKE IT HAPPEN!
300 kph Matt;)
PleaseReview the Normal Chiron🙏🏾
We can't get Bugatti in Australia :(
An alfa 156 gta sounds better
What are those things in the back windows ?, They look like pot plants LOL
2:40 is that sam from seethroughglass?
"not made for beauty" Hmmmm.... I doubt that
Matt has been training. Looking almost as good as the car mate!
The level of engineering that goes into this car blows my mind! Even the tiniest things that you’d never even think about go Into such huge consideration.
So 0 to 60 in this particular car in this particular video was around 4 seconds... And not 2.3.
Was ein deutscher nichtsgönner der hat gar nicht mit gefühlt
300kmh
YES
I wish the driver guy didn't wear a mask just to see his reactions on mat's wheezing and laughing like a psychopath
Don't ever compare it to a battery can!
I love the potted plants in the rear window. Nice touch Bugatti.
I am from indonesia🇮🇩💪
Now need a go in a Koenigsegg
That reaction at 5:12 is the most honest thing I've seen in a while LOL
0-100km/h 3sec with 2 people on board
Let me get this straight. You wear masks in the car but not outside the car when y’all were real close to each other at the beginning of the video? Bruhh seriously.
Congrats matt!!!!
I really hate clickbait!
Bhai can you make a drag race of buggatti with Lamborghini cars
Lucky you!
The speedo is reading in Km/hr and the title says miles/hr. That's a huge difference!
Max speed on the speedo = 500kph = 310 in MPH = Title.  Unfortunately it's technically true, but still is click bait...  Was really excited to someone going 300mph. I guess that's his speed limiter. The speeds you reached here are mainly reachable on a super sport bike/sport bikes in general. Upsetting...
The title for the video is misleading I guess cause Mo Vlogs uploaded a video of him driving around  Bugatti Super Sport 2 days ago....🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Dude say what you want, I'm not believing anything unless you verify using CARWOW STICK OF TRUTH.
That drone must have been very scary, especially when you're in such a fast car. It would break through that windscreen as fast as hell.
He looks like ken miles
300 kmh not mph
Its absolutely *Car Wow* 😱 He went through the photographer like a bullet 😅
woooow if i saw right it went from 0 to 300kmph in like 15 seconds..like holy hell
Hummmm.  Your title is wrong. You went 300 KPH, not MPH.
Matt starting working out seriously I guess , looks great On you!
Wow...1 million views in just 12 hours time..that shows how famous Matt is..😎👍
this car accelerate to 300km/h faster than a regular car to 100km/h lol
Quite smart title
Bruuhh that's 300 km/h🤔
Click bait lol
only 5 billion euro will provide you with private motorway across Europe
This chiron is good but...     Not as good as BMWs iDrive system
The fastest isn't the 911 you just try???
WTH Matt! I wanted to see how much I could save on a Chiron!
That car is soooooo fast I wouldn't be surprised if it did nought to 200 in the time Tesla takes to do nought to sixty
Matt, you are special. But you are sleeping when I post the comment.
We want bugatti drag race
Why r there plants in the car? 4:49
The turbo lag was terrible
If it can serve as consolation you know these speeds. Airplane and trains
I wish u can review koenigseeg
Koenigsegg eats this for breakfast.
Is it 300kph or 300mph?
Wow. Lucky guy. Car is amazing.
How much do we save through carwow?
The thumbnail looks like it’s about to crash with itself
Super fun vid. Super fast car. Well done Matt...👍🏻
Yeah.. You can tell it right away that he really is German. Congrats Mat and Carwow!
Where the salty koenigsegg fanboys at?
Matt I’m looking for my new car , can you pls make the new  M235 xdrive 2021 vs M240
The fastest 1/4 mile you've done is not the tesla model s, is the porsche 911 turbo s, or even the mclaren 720s!
Beh-gat-tee
you are so lucky
title: 300mph video: 300kph  fast is fast, but one is nearly 200kph faster
How much can I save on the bugatti on carwow?
Should of had a drag race lol
O-60mph in 2.3sec But a Dodge deamon will also do in 2.3 sec
Why didn't Mat do the was the carwow stick of truth test??
Is that plants behind??
"Its like a tesla for the first few seconds"  "sure..."
Dec not the first
It's KM not MPH. LOL
The thumbnail looks like the Chiron is going to crash into the one in which Mat is lmao
Oh yes that Bugatti engineer sounds very French. Definitely a French car Bugatti is
Matt forgot to poke it with the stick of truth
The way Mat laughed,he looked like a toy...🤖🤖
https://youtu.be/K-RfCa4F6cs Bajaj- Triumph partnership
Can i buy this car from carwow app
nice
How much will i save on this car if i buy it through carwow?
Wait what Matt has done a 10.1 sec in a 911 turbo s
DAMN that's all I got to say about that 👍👍👼🤤🤤🤤🤤 awesome brother !!!!!!!
Mat: Lets do 300 now. Christian: we have done that twice 😂.
When this is in forza horizon 4 it won't go 250 fully upgraded BET
No one: Christian : YES
Matt its 300 km/h on the clock ..! Also Matt: I'm the first to go in a the 300mph bugatti lool..  Facts: Matt was only doing 186mph in that bugatti.. What an over excited mopped, 🤣🤣🤣
Wtf is with the plants???😂
That car has 4 exhaust tips. That means each exhaust has 4 cylinders... my car only has 4 cylinders lmao 🤣  Stupid 328i
im just happy matt got to drive one of the peaks of automotive performance, from one car guy to another, hope you did what we all wouldve wanted to.     spoke too soon
How to escape COVID-19:
That German guy is super cool.... YES
I was waiting for that kind of video with Matt for a long time😍
It's still a dream for many boys...
its showing on the digital speedo  300kph not 300mph. If is 300mph is meant to show 482kph.
Does that car have eye lashes?!?!? 😅
Best video for ages
Me yesterday: Mat only reviews boring cars Mat today:
0-300 in 16/17 seconds? WOW
5:12 Can't imagine how extraordinarily fantastic it would be, hearing Matt laughing like that XD
bro it was 300+ kmph not mph 😒
I need to get me one of those.
Side note: The car didn’t even use half it’s power! I’m amazed
No it is not fastest where the heck is the Tesla roadster 2.0
#Matt was acting like #Supercarblondie.
lets put jokes aside THE GERMANS ARE THE BEST ENGINEERS IN THE WORLD PERIOD
agera rs laughs in 440+ kph
pull up ur mask matt!
hmm isnt 299km/h only 185MPH... Not 300mph
This car can get to my cars top speed faster then my car can get to 60 MPH.
too bad it's so ugly
Yeah I’m not buying a damn Volkswagen  for all that money and you’re going “Limit” it on how fast I can go!
I thought Mat have tried every car in the world. 😟
How much will I save on this through Carwow ?
That speedo is showing KMPH!
Awesome video but there is a massive difference between 300 kmh and mph. F this click bait title.
Guy went for a spin in the fastest car ever with BANE.
When I saw what the new video was about, I thought;  NO  WAY
I timed about 13 seconds to 300... wow thats unreal !
Y dont u do buggati videos more often i think this is ur first one .. just curious
Deep inside 40% of components are from a Golf mk7! 😂  Shame they couldn't let you drive it. Or atleast bring one you could have driven.  Look but no touch! It's like a strip club with beefed up security guards. NO FUN
I love that engineer. Pure business.
Isn't he wearing his mask backwards?
He said fastest 1/4 mile is from tesla 10.4 sec, but he actually did 1/4 in 10.2 secs in both porsche 911 turbo s as well as in taycan
4:58 Isn’t the Porsche 911 turbo s the fastest one?
What amazes me is we live in a time, where the people who develop such a product, don't earn enough to afford such a vehicle.
I’m slightly confused now about the normal Chiron. As far as I know it was a failed attempt to make the fastest production car since the development took too long and Bugatti kept it limited to 268mph. But now they make this, which should have been the normal Chiron in the first place.
TIL Mat has 20 years of experience reviewing cars
My dream job... Are you accepting applicants?
Only 300 km/h?  😂
Vroom vroom I’ve got the need for speed
POP DAT CHERRY!
300 kph not mph Also koenigsegg one goes 273 mph
Only me thinking the 992 Turbo S kicked Chiron's *ss in 0-62 mph?? 16 cil 4 turbos against 6 cil 2 turbos and being kicked. 3.5 million Euros for this?
Ohhhhh yeah
not mph, it should be kmph
Hmmm I think I was wrong this means that gg exotics doesn’t have a ss
What did you get for it? A cookie or more money?!!
This is the no.  of people that wanted to be in his place.  ⬇️⬇️⬇️↙️
I never heard that kind of laughter from Mat🤣🤣
It's ok
8:50 don't mind me, just nerding out over both the speed and the Sony A9 blasting 20 pics per second in the background.
Matt you lied! The fastest car you’ve ever driven is the Porsche 911 T S
No your not gg exotics had one before this
JESKO Absolute Enters Bugatti :Left 🤣🤣
300kmh
Change that title to km/h
Guess how happy when Matt was told to review this beast
POWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRR~ Jeremy Clarkson
How much do you think the engineer guy makes a year? Id think its a stupidly high amount
its 300 km/h not mph ... : (
That’s 300kmh not 300mph don’t lie to us Mat  I’m disappointed 😔
Clickbait? 302 kph is only 187 mph.
amazing tech but i still love the Eb110 super sport
Lol his reaction is like a virgin goes first time for sex with 5 models from Versace Hahahha
Yaaaah matt kalah duluan sama oto driver yg review mas fitra wkwk gadikasih nyetir lagi matt waduh sayang banget 😁
Matt is the most uniquely fun & yet very informative car reviewer !  We are happy you just did that, infact we were waiting for you in bugatti !  👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼  Congrats for 1 million in just 10 hrs !!!!  👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
The plants in the back window are dying.  Water please
Cool
Doesn't that say 1614 hp ?? at the 6.40 time
4:27 flower pots behind
Hi Matt, what about a stick test ?
As cool as this was, the video of James May (aka Captain Slow) going 250+ in the Veyron will always be cooler.
-_- kinda defeats the purpose that you can only drive a slower speed
It kinda feels like a roller coaster 🎢
This thing can get to 250 kph faster than my car can get to 70 mph. I use that comparison because 250 kph is the middle of the Chiron’s speedo and 70 mph is the middle of mine
Omg
Anyone time that car from 0 to 100 and then from 0 to 300?
Click?
300 KM/H not 300 MP/H
Awesome car!  My favourite!  And the guy not even using launch control and the car just achieved 300 km/h like in 13 seconds? Well done Matt. This is a new era. If anyone interested check this Bugatti Chiron modell which exactly the same copy of the very first Bugatti Chiron which came in the UK. If you want to see that too the link will be in comment section! 😉😉😉🙃🙂 https://youtu.be/nxoPlOTgoPk
Devil
He legit pop your cheri hard
How much can i save on this car by using Carwow?
Matt : do you ever say "NO" Christian: yes
Dat title tho.
Only Matt can make a serious German engineer laugh.
Doug DeMuro got to drive the Chiron, but Mat Watson doesn’t. #MotorJustice4Mat
Love how excited and happy you looked!
Matt went from Zero to child faster than Bugatti went from Zero to a 100.😂😂 He is such a genuine, funny bloke. Thanks for keeping us entertained.
Mat’s excitement is amazingly adorable
Is Koenigsegg better than this ca-   "Y e s"
They should've blacked out the wheels
Congrats Matt.
Who cares about VW fraud group combustion bs
This man clearly has the best job in the world!!
This car will truly defeat Kawasaki H2R in drag strip... just look at the Bugatti Acceleration, its way more insane than H2R
It’s perfect for collectors to increase their value astronomically , as a car it’s unusable , you must buy a Golf.
I'm wonder how much engineer getting paid from bugatti 🤔  I bet its he is enjoying his job!
and comes with a pair of pot plants on the back shelf..
now ! 432km/h lest go !?! :O :D
All the big when they see this car “O I can beat this o o o sh!t”
Matt I couldn't find the Chiron super sport on the Carwow website, I was looking forward to seeing  how much I could have saved.
Reasons I want be rich help people and Chiron
My car top speed is 164km/h 🤦
Title is misleading, he didn’t go anywhere near 300mph.....still an amazing video though
I think there's no better marketing selling point than to say.  "if you buy this car, we will allow you to go to our own test track and do 300mph."
Drag race chiron vs regera pls
Mat is happy
Mat driving the fastest car in the world? I don’t know about that-
"this"
"YES"
The Car Wow Stock of Truth has left the track....
Matt you always been i cheap cars except this one!!!!
😀
Koenigsegg is faster 🤷🏽‍♂️
Is that a trees in on the engine bay?
F1 car vs Bugatti Chiron
I love be unfazed the other guy is by the speed of the car
How much
You just experienced what we all look forward to go through. Let it sink and enjoy!
Someone wasn't allowed to use carwow's stick of truth 😹
Well done Matt ! Loved your reactions 👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾 what a monster 🔥🔥🔥
Matt is just the best💯✌
After 9h already 1 million views. No wonder they wanted you guys. Congrats :)
And where was "The Stick Of Truth"??? 🤣
Next video : Drag Race Bugatti Chiron vs Porsche 911 Turbo S in 1/4 mile.
Drag race this against that red Porsche 911 Turbo S you got :)
German must hate his daily car
Should I go and buy it or should I shortlist it? 😂
this is the fastest car in the world in a straight line only, to be the fastest car in the world the car should do the same distance back and forth on a public road, koenigsegg holds the record for the fastest car in the world
Didnt actually do 300mph??? sick click bait lol
Matt are you working out? Looking very fit man!
I was thinking of getting one of these, but only if I can get a discount through carwow 🤣
The engineer is a proper German.
5:11 Pure Joy sounds
최대한 빠르게 한국어 번역 부탁드립니다
DIs golf veri fazt
300 km ? Child's play , Not hating man and I know this channel 99.9 has stock cars but a Supra or Godzilla will do this same exact acceleration OR EVEN FASTER and close to top speed as well , R35 will easily do it , Fully upgraded to every possibility obviously.
Fantastic video. Cant help but smile while watching it. Brilliant
"9:51", WaNt To sEe HoW mUcH yoU cAn sAVe oN a BugaTTi?, Feel bad for my poor soul
Up to 100km/h the Tesla is fast...
That Bugatti engineer at the beginning should be fired! Rude and undressed for such an expensive brand. It’s a fast car Bugatti engineer..... it’s not like it’s a machine that cures corona virus. Get the sand out of your twat you arrogant crout!  Fun fact. You only need a drivers license to drive this car. Not a “Bugatti engineer” 😂😂
Let's see how much you can save on this New! BUGATTI CHIRON SS 300+ on carwow
I am waiting for ferrari roma review
It didn’t go 300 mph, it went 188.28 mph gotta love that clickbait!
Drag rase!!!
WRONG TITLE.  LIES..   not 300MPH
Matt should challenge Yanni using this car
Serious turbo lag, what piece of shit
This with that engineer driving against the current champ, the 911 turbo s over the quarter mile. Please make it happen 🚘!
The fastest you've reviewed is Porche 911 turbo s, 1/4 in 10.2s. Did you forget that?
Hello did you try racing that buggati to yami
How much can I save on the Bugatti SS thru the Car WOW app?
i saw 300 mph and thought it said you were going 300 mph still pleased though
Why is the grill like the normal chiron, instead the bigger one like in the record car?
Look at these new Bugatti’s on carwow and you can save a couple million
That wasn’t 300mph
Oh man, I wish they could have pushed it at least up to 400 km/h. I mean 300 km/h is still really fast but it's a speed that most car journalists will have experienced many times already in cars like Ferraris and Lamborghinis. It would be amazing to see Matt's reaction to 400+ km/h speed.
So, how much can you save with car wow? 👀
My guys got his house plants on his rear shelves 😂😂😂😂
Would love to see a dragy gps 100-200 time
This mask shit is just fucking hilarious
I see a mask, I switch to another video... Adios!
it is 300 KMPH not 300 MPH
3:35 why is there a plant in the rear window?!
That's definitely Agent 47
The tail lights look inspired by the current Audi A7.
Next drag race : Mat on a Bugatti , Yianny on a Crome Aventador , Joe on a 911 turbo s
Giddy schoolgirl mode: activated.
3:21 imagine if a $3.5m car uses tape strips to keep the headlights in place
I actually think that the super sport looks better than the original also I bet at 300 mph.... it feels like a fast golf....
Very gentle launch ~4 seconds to 100kmh then a missile after
How much do you save if you go on Carwow?? 🤔 🤔 😁 😁 😁
Mat I want to just say what a sound good Bloke you are. l don’t know any reviewer who would or could have given a more honest and entertaining reaction. 😁😁😁
not even close to 300mph what a waste
Hey matt, any advice for someone who would like to do auto content
Matt oh I sooo wanna experience that beast oooooooo one day
100-200 3 sec
Loved it !!
Sorry but fastest car is keonigsegg 😐
Where's the link to carwow where I can save £5000 on a new Bugatti?
That was 300 km/h, not mph.
I read this wrong im thinking Matt was going to take this thing for a spin up to 300mph lol
He sounds so german
drones arent dangerous whats a bit of plastic going to do to a 3.5 mil car lol
Carwow: 3 2 1  Advert: Go 😉
You should've asked him what he drives
For the fastest top speed and accelerating car, you will need to contact Christian von Koenigsegg actually.
300 mph or 300 kph?
😍🤩👍
Correction-I'm the FIRST to go in the 300kmh  Bugatti Chiron Super Sport lol Great Vid !
Isn’t the fastest car you’ve ever been was a 911 turbo s
Can't believe you didn't use the moment telling him it was dirty so could they bring another one... but I guess being cheeky and playful isn't easy on camera.
why does the driver sound like a robot
Of course, a german engineer!
But.... they.... didn't go 300 mph....
Okay, lol, I suspect this is going to make your drag races feel underwhelming for you now. It's gonna be like needing that Bugatti speed fix, but just can't quite get it.
From a Volkswagen. Wow
Maybe the first Bugatti I like the aesthetic of!
Way too many ads interrupting this. Very annoying.
Wow!
How much will I save on the car if I use carwow... I’m trying to buy a Bugatti
mattt the fastest car doing the 1/4 mile was the carrera turbo s 10.1 secs Amazing vid!!
This is a very cool video, isn't it?
Now how much can we save on a Bugatti Chiron Super Sport?? a mill?
The normal Chiron
As wait the koenigsegg...
Well I'm glad he likes the Chiron!!!😂😂😂
Matt, the fastest car you have driven 0-60mph was the 992 turboS, 10.1 secs...
How much, on average, can Carwow save me on one of these? I've just got my bonus and I think I have a couple quid to spare.
Title says 300mph, driver says limited to 300kph.
Doesn't seem too crazy to 60mph / 100kph... but after that holy crap lol
Fastest car in the world ever?  Nah man definitely not
thats KmH not MPH -_-
Bruh are you kidding me this is clickbait at its finest...
Matt is class 👍😄
Is that a block of c4 behind his head?
Come on Matt! You're excellent! Dear Carwow...pay the man what he wants!
Such a great video. A masterpiece of a vehicle and a legendary reaction.
I adore these. That butt.
This was fucking sick! Thanks Matt and Carwow
This is long tail done right take notes McLaren
This guy is living the best job of anyone could have
The title should be 300 km/h not miles per hour
2:14 How much on Carwow ?
He wasn’t even launching it imagine if he launched it
Fxxk...
wheres the jesko?
Bugatti: we’re going to sell you a car that can do 300+mph...    But you we are going to restrict it to 273mph
was i the only one waiting on the usual  "So what's my final verdict" 😂
Oh my god...Very fast!!!💪🏎️👊
300 mph..... Ummmm not even close!  Title Lies.
Feels like he’s talking to Niki Lauda😂
9:50 I really thought you were about to insult us mere mortals..... even the discount would be more than I could afford
You can see the flux capacitors through the back window 😜
300kph not mph
Why did u lie Mat  U have been in a faster car than a tesla cheetah, in a porsche 911 turbo s that does 1/4 mile in 10.1 sec.  LIKE WHYYYY DIDNT U MENTION THAT.
If anyone deserved This passenger ride it's Matt! He's such a genuine Guy. You can really see it through his unorthodox tests and review's. I watch carwow for Matt. Watching Matt has become My go too straight after work. Such a relief honestly! Keep doing this top geeza!
How much can we save on this with CarWow? Serious question.
wow!
That car looks watered down to the one the did the run🧐
5:12 😂
I know it's necessary for that car, but damn those are THE biggest brake rotors I have ever seen lol
WORLD EXCLUSIVE SHIT TITLE!!!   300 kilometers per hour is roughly only 186.4 mph. You didn't even hit speeds equal to 2/3 of 300 miles per hour bro.  You may be the first journalist to hit this speed in this car but you are definitely not the first person.  You did not even break 200mph.  Huge difference between the two. Fix your title!  #CLICKBAIT
3.5 million who the hell wants to drive 300 mph. Not me.
Mat: That was the fastest road car in the world. Also Mat: want to see how much you can save on a normal car?
The title is misleading as he did not go 300MPH? he went 300KMH..?
How much can we save on a Chiron through carwow?
Wow Matt, what deal are Carwow offering then? 😂
It's that kind of speed that leaves you opening the door to get out thinking you're about to stop, but in fact you're still doing 60mph.
Ugr lambo guys laughing rn cause this is nothing
Had to bail out of watching this video unfortunately as I can't see faces behind STUPID masks. Why are you acquiescing to this lunacy of covering your face?? I'm disappointed Matt...
5:05  So this is what exactly happened... "...hahaha..."
Omg what is this - https://youtu.be/CNsUGKT0ww8
Turbo lag at beginning.
I always wonder if there are any Bugatti owners out there who have taken their car to vmax.
Matt...Any CarWow offers on the Bugatti?
not gonna happen matt: cry a little
No one: Literally not a single soul:  Matt: ......"Isn't it?"
300 mph....damn it is fast Matt isnt it? :D
I'm pretty certain there are a couple of pot plants in the engine bay. Good job it's pre-production.
Someone give this man a koenigsegg pls
Are those plants back there?
So Misha on the on the Nurborgring is not a car journalist indeed, but I can say that it is more I interesting to watch this thing on the Nurborgring. I like Matt's videos though.
At min 5 u say Tesla was fastest ever u been into, i thought the Porsche Turbo s was...10.01
The two plants in the engine bay make it look really cozy inside...
Konisheg vs bugatii car wow edition
Maaaan what a coincidence!!!! I was about to ask when are you drag racing hypercars?????? Chiron, 918, huayra, koenigsegg. That would be insane!!!!!!! Please read this matt🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Thought it said Citroën
That engineer is a as cool as a cucumber. I guess going 300 mph does that to you
i really wanna see how a 911 Turbo S goes against this in a quartermile
🙌🏻🙌🏻
Lot of turbo lag in the 0-100
Wonder what Christians daily driver is?
Error in title - should be KPH!
Anyone interested in supporting a small youtube channel, I would really appreciate it if you would!(it only takes a couple of seconds!)🙏🙏🙏
The fastest but ugliest supercar
Can you used Koenigsegg regera next?
Not mph, km/h
Until it makes  a new lap record on the Nordschleife it is just a millionaire's expensive toy whose destiny is to stay in a garage.
the title is correct because this car actually moves up to 300mph..look up for the actual top speed test video of the super sport..but the version being tested here it is still under development so they pegged it at 300kmh.
It's chiron, what did you expect!
Can u do a c43 vs a m4 please
This work Cristian remember 😹😹😹
I can't wait to save £3000 on a new Bugatti Chiron Super Sport.
Change the Title to 300km/h not Mph
The Bugatti engineer sounds like an automated robot
Youv come along way matt since that test drive in the feista, im so proud :)
you shall race the 1500hp supra against the chiron.
RESEÑA DEL CUPRA  O LEON CUPRA
I’ve been watching CARWOW for maybe a year now and Watching Matt shit himself in a Bugatti is more reason to continue lol
I wonder how much Carwow can save me on the Bugatti 🤔
Very rarely do you hear Mat say "Bugatti" after saying "This, it's the..." 😂
https://youtu.be/tFFywIOo2zU
You said that Tesla model S is the fastest 1/4 mile car at 10,4 s but wasnt the new Porsche faster? 10,1 on 10,2 s.
if i’m paying 3.5 million for that car i better be able to go 300 wherever and whenever i want
Wait, He didn’t poke it with the stick of truth? That’s illegal
surveilling kithara
Fake buggati ???
Seeing Matt this excited almost made me shed a tear, you’ve worked so hard for this mate. 🥺🚀
Anyone know what all that stuff was with all the wires hanging out sitting behind the rear window?
How much can i save on buying this Chiron through the carwow app?
Good thing Matt was the first to review this.  We wouldn't want a chick with blonde hair reading off a brochure telling the specs about this vehicle...
Why Mat didn't use his stick of truth to see if there were fakes exhausts 🤣🤣🤔
How much can i save buying Chiron Super Sport through CarWow?
It's 300km/h not mph
The Wayne foundation needed some money during the pandemic it seems 🦇
5:54 0-100 km in about 4 seconds! Not so impressive result for Buggatti
Such a privilege to be the first journalist in the world do take a ride in it! Great video!
Now when you test drive the 2021 BMW M3, the Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG, the Nissan GT-R Nismo or the Tesla P100 D or whatever comes across your way will be absolutely BORING. But wait there is 1 car that will smoke this car up to 255mph next year. Jay Leno and Joe Rogan already have theirs paid for and will be driving the new 2021 Tesla Roadster. I know the ride is only $250,000 vs this car that goes about 45 mph faster but at $3 to $4 million dollars. Oil changes are $20,000 +, the Tesla will cost nothing. This car has I believe a minimum of 4 radiators and the tires and wheels that cost $10,000 each to replace. Yes Jay Leno can lay for all of these luxuries and not even worry about anything up and including the $5,000 to insure the Bugatti. It’s all relative but Tesla is one bad bitch made by a man that will eventually buy this car and laugh at how he can think of ways he can modify the Tesla roadster to do 325mph and a way to get you out of jail if you get caught going that fast on some highways or freeways in the United States. 😎😎
Matt, you need to check your shorts!  They might be damp!  LOL!
Mat you lucky lucky man
300KPH Mat!
Matt getting far too excited by this mediocre demo. The 0-62mph (0-100kph) was 4 seconds -  not even close to a Tesla Model S P100D. The limited speed was only 188mph. And this car will almost never be able to run at 300mph. The conditions are too rarified. The Roadster 2 can hit 100kph no slower than 1.9 seconds. I also expect it to run at 500kph (312.5mph) in order to achieve the next benchmark that Elon Musk was alluding to (also impractical to achieve). Bugattis historically force themselves into a very temporary spotlight with brute force mechanics. More finessed vehicles always sit beside them. 15 years after it was made the McLaren F1 took on the then new Veyron and left it standing for most of a mile until the extra 15mph top end speed kicked in for the Veyron. It's an overhyped, over-rated car. It looks so ordinary next to a Rimac C2 and has notably less power and torque (Rimac = 1,888hp, 2,300nm, 0-100kph @ 1.85 seconds). Now THAT is a car to get excited about.
How much can i save up with carwow on this particular car?
Matt so down to earth he is 🙂👊🏻
Can carwow get me a deal on this thing?
You are a very lucky man, Sir!  What sort of discount is CarWow offering?
Can’t wait to see the race between bugatti chiron super sport and koenigsegg jesko absolut.
What is the discount on carwow?
No words to explain with the excitement!! Thanks matt ❤️
Was waiting for matt to say how much we could save on it through carwow
I'm so Jealous RN 😭😭😭😭
The driver sounds like Daniel Brühl in Rush😀
Bugatti engineers have literally channeled The Simpsons  “I’m puttin’ speed holes in my car... makes it go faster”
Yes it's fast, but for 3,5 million euros..... It better be.
Who would of thought someone from Walsall being invited by Bugatti to drive there cars show how far you really can go in life🌠
I love the pure joy in your voice
Yes
5:11 maniacally laughing*
9:28 "any other car now is gonna seem slow" with that 300....that's a fact🔥🔥🥺
I will buy one using Carwow
I want the mask that christian is wearing.
What happened to checking the exhaust with the stick of truth?
Nope, pretty sure the test driver beat you to it.
Matt was having too much fun.
" he ALWAYS stops accelerating at 300-302 km/h without fail" is what I meant to say - Typo...
Everyone is entitled to an opinion,  but why 1k dislikes!?  Jealousy!? I'm chuffed for Matt that he's been lucky to have an experience that 99.99999% of us will never have.
Matt is truly a lucky bloke, his inner child always shows and it’s amazing. How any man should feel in their car or cars haha. Keep it up Matt.
Mat Watson screaming Girl with the German "Humanoid" Robot Christian Meyer :-)  It's sad that on each Acceleration Run the Precise German Robot stops at the Recommended "Do Not Exceed" speed for the Nardo track (300 Kmh / 186 Mph), but he never stops accelerating at 300-302 km/h - He is definitely A Robot :-)  Going above that speed could lift the car up due to various bumps, and potentially send it flying or crashing into the sidewall.  However when the REAL TopGear with Jeremy, Richard and James went to Nardo in Sep 2012 for the Series 18 Episode 1 shoot, they all exceeded 200 mph in the Aventador, Noble M600 & McLaren 12C. Shows how crazy the 3 guys were :-)
No stick of truth? 😂
koenigsegg: give us a week
How much can I save in one of these through carwow??
problem the title says 300 MPH but the car did 300 KMH
Missed opportunity to poke it with the carwow steak of truth
Matt you've got your KMPH shambles with MPH. Video title says mph but in fact car was showing kmph. Sort it out mate, bit too excited I guess
Matt, try a Rimac Concept 2👌🔝
Supercar blondie crying in the corner.
Finally not just a LaFerrari
Great video Matt.
I don't see 300mph!!! Click bate!!!!_
It looks slow when launching
Thanks for the all great comments and stay safe and I love your video and I love your car
No 300mph is 300kmh
At 8:40 Matt did a rolling race in Chiron
That's brilliant Mat!! But i think you went wrong on the title, the maximum speed was 300 km/h not 300MPH. Keep going bro, you're doing a great job.
Well done 😊 deserve it !🍻
Why are you wearing a stupid mask
Who loves Carwow and Matt 👇
FR c est quoi les câbles derrière la vitre arrière ?  EN what is a câblé in glass please
Fastest... Says Bugatti after a one pass run at the PRIVATE VW track of "eralessy" I say BULLSHIT, a track VW loans or rents to noone for fear of being crushed...  I'll stick with Guinness world records.. that states koenigsegg agera rs is the fastest car ever and yes it was tested on a closed public road....
300mph ...should be 300 KMH..
Matt is a small child in a toyshop when he's in that Bugatti
It hurts to see someone else living your dream...
I wonder if corwow offers better deals on this car ;-)
Matt points at dial saying 1614 .. says 614hp  At full acceleration why would this ~1500hp car be putting out 614 hp?
slow for this power
😁😁👍👍
Normal Car: let’s test 100-200km/h This: let’s test 200-300km/h
How will those american rubber bumpers look on this? The exhaust sticks out quite far!!!
Wondering if you can get a discount through carwow lol.
When vw make normal cars : Maybe lets working on bugatti to beat koenigseg
Thats bloody amazing!   However I want to see 300 MPH now!
Bugatti didn’t let Mat use the CarWow stick of truth 😂
What people forget when bragging about Koenigsegg being faster is how refined the Chiron is. It's comfortable if you want it to, it's quiet inside and can be a good partner for a long drive. It's automobile perfection in many ways.
You should know it only did 300KM???????
Can't drive the car, needs to be driven by one of the engineers, can't even do 400km/h let alone max and the ones sold have a speed limiter.   I don't know what's more disappointing. This video or the Bugatti themselves...
only ppl without elementary education disliked this video
I want a Lamborghini
It’s just a sport to go faster and faster. But it’s pointless in the end for a street car. Since we have rules
Id say Christian is the life and soul at party's
YES
That dude is extremely German lol
Matt's reaction made me react the same haha love it!
Great to see happy Mat, enjoy these moments mate!!
My man made it!!
Matt be like "Momma I made it"
Im waiting the cuarter mile score
Hi Mat, Where is the carwow link for this car? How much could I save on it?
i love the way they are just havin a chill talk while going faster than cars the average people can affort just fun
It's going 300 Km\h not 300 Mph...
i think the way the headlights are sculpted and designed are a very nice improvement over the original. Gives it a nicer, meaner look while also looking stylish.
That thumbnail looks like Mat is gonna be barrelled down by another Chiron doing 300+ mph.
Awesome engineering!😎
Im pretty sure the engineer is Baine from batman....
Hi! I am...Matt and today I will wrap this Chiron in topaz. And its wheels too. Which car should I wrap in the next video?! With my good friend Habibi.
Pleased for you mat. Deserve that experience
Fuck that version looks even better than the base one. And the base Chiron is already gorgeous
If you paid for the speedometer,  use all of the speedometer
How much discount do i get , if i order it from carwow :)?
Why you guys wearing a mask your both healthy
That was not 300 mph that was kilometers
first time there is no carwow deal LOL
Christian sounds like a real card.
Matt is a truly “salt of the Earth” bloke. Still has and shows that inner child-like excitement. Love it!
LET THIS MAN DRIVE BUGATTI
No wheelspin at all...
The title is not accurate.
Y'know, I think I'd squeal like a little girl, too. And I'd be sure to wear three layers of underwear. Thanks.
Der mechaniker hört sich deutsch an
It's an MKBHD special
9:34 damn
Title says 300mph, car does 300km/h, might want to update the title 😉
Your emotion at 5:12 is EPIC
NARDÓ CIRCUIT.  The track is 12.5 kilometres (7.8 mi) long[2] and is round, has four lanes for cars and motorcycles totaling 16 metres (52 ft) in width and has a separate inner ring for trucks at a width of 9 metres (30 ft). In the cars/motorcycle ring the lanes are banked at such a degree that a driver in the outer most lane doesn't need to turn the wheel while driving at speeds of up to 240 km/h (149 mph). In essence, at the so-called neutral speed which is different for the four lanes, one can drive as if in a straight lane. However extremely fast cars still require the steering wheel to be turned when going faster than the maximum neutral speed. For example the Koenigsegg CCR which set a speed record for a production car at the Nardò Ring did so with the steering wheel at a 30° angle. This speed record has since been beaten by the Bugatti Veyron at Volkswagen Group's private Ehra-Lessien straight line test track in Germany, and hence the CCR only holds the speed record for the Nardò Ring. In the process of fighting a turn as needed when going faster than the neutral speed quite a bit of potential top speed is lost and hence a fast car will go faster in a straight line than what is possible on the Nardó Ring. Even at the neutral speed, in a banked turn a car runs a bit heavier than it would in a straight line, since the downforce created by the banking increases the rolling resistance on the tires. There has been one fatality at the ring. The neutral speed for the four car/motorcycle lanes are respectively:[3]  Lane 1 – 100 km/h (62 mph)  Lane 2 – 140 km/h (87 mph)  Lane 3 – 190 km/h (118 mph)  Lane 4 – 240 km/h (149 mph)  During regular weekly working activity the maximum speed allowed on the circular track is 240 km/h (149 mph). Higher speeds are only allowed at times when a client gets the track for its exclusive use. The neutral speed for the truck ring is between 80 km/h (50 mph) and 140 km/h (87 mph) over the width of the track, highest in the outer most part of the lane. The plant also includes other tracks; the most important is 6.222 km handling circuit, completely inside the circular one. It is characterized by a long main straight and sixteen curves of different radius and variable lateral slope. It can provide useful results for durability, reliability, vehicle dynamics and tire tests of both cars and motorbikes.[4] The track was featured in British TV series Top Gear in 1992, showing footage of the Jaguar XJ220, driven by Martin Brundle on a top speed test. It was again featured in the series 18 opener, when Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May drove in a Lamborghini Aventador, a Noble M600 and a McLaren MP4-12C, respectively, to see who could reach the highest speed. The rough surface of the track figured prominently in the latter episode, and it was resurfaced shortly afterwards in 2018.[5]
That was 300km/h...not 300 mph would have been 483 kmh!
sounding like an fkn airplane
When will be a koenigsegg review available?
'blimey this is just brilliant' that's the most British thing I have ever heard lmao
Mat lied that Tesla was the fastest car in his show. https://youtu.be/z4zilQLGdfs
I love your enthusiasm Matt.....Lool
Masks are so stupid
U should meet with super car blondie to discuss cars
lucky F*****
Mat you have been in the new 911 turbo s, which is faster than the tesla model s
Btw, how much discount can we get on this Bugatti through carwow.com??? 🤔
Wow, how did you get that insane car, congrats!!!
🔥🔥🔥👍
I wonder how much i could save on a New Bugatti through carwow? 😂🤔
Good for Matt, he deserved this.
How German of the engineer
Matt: Fastest car Ive been in 0-60 is a Tesla Model S Performance.  Porsche 911: AM I A JOKE TO YOU?
I feel comfortable saying that is the best rear end of any car for sale in my opinion
such a shit acceleration until the turbos kicks in lol the 0-50kmh is such a weak spot.
Its not the fastest Almost a dislike for that.
No car wow stick of truth test on those exhaust?
That was Nardò near Lecce in south italy
So disappointed that he did not poke those pipes with the stick of truth
Amazing video 😭😭😁😁
When 4.5 million subscribers only gets you a passenger ride. Stick to your Audi's Matt.
They don’t let him near a Ferrari how did he get his butt inside a Bugatti 😂
The fastest car is Bugatti la voiture  noire 18m dollars 💵
That car not only looks better than a Tesla but is faster and you don't have to wait he's for it to charge
Mat do a review of a new Audi Q7 not the old boring one
I'm so looking forward to Koenigsegg Jesko and Jesko Absolute. And especially Gemera. A spaceous 4-seater that hits 100 kph in 1.9 s.
you wrote 300 mph. In the video, the car goes 300Kmh. that means 186 mph. close to a clickbait?
How did this guy get this job, this high on the totem pole of manufacturer affinity? He's kind of annoying compared to Chris Harris for example. Anyway, who the hell is this guy?
The acceleration it is crazy .......
never been more jealous in my life
Está medio feo el color no ?
Mat forgot to poke the stick. Bugatti's exhaust pipes must be fake.
Matt after every drag race after this experience - "What exactly happened?  No point telling you because neither car went as fast as the Bugatti Chiron so lets just move onto the rolling race".
It was 300kph not mph as the title says. Big difference
WOW !!!
0:54 Homer: Hey, what are all these holes? Car Salesman: These are speed holes, they make the car go fast. Homer: Ohhh yeah, speeed holes!
Just immagine what F1 drivers go through.. they do this through some corners..
i still wanna see the carwow stick truth  😏  😏  😏  😏  😏
«it’s a evaluation ride for future evaluations” what you say when you want to joyride it
300mph? Well i don’t think so
Matt reactions though.. Priceless 😂😂
0 to 187mph in 14s!
Worlds fastest Car? I think your on a wrong Car bro. Hmm. Is this guy doesn't know about Koenigseggs? 😅
FINALLY U REVIEW A BUGATTI!!!!!! PLEASE REVIEW THE BUGATTI VEYROOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
I think Matt deserves that.
NEXT : Chiron vs jimny
This video was brought to you by Mat “isn’t it?” Watson
Sooo most cars does 0-60 in 3.xx -4.xx but this does 0-200 in 3.xx-4.xx sec , im sorry 5- cent but this Bugatti is the real G-unit.
The speedo showed 300 KM/h which is 185 MP/h....
Also wohl 300 kmh statt mph
0-100 seems slugish. like 4 secs
I'm not a big fan of the looks. Bit of an ugly looking car. Great performance though.
Want to see how much you can save on a new Bugatti? Go to carwow now.
Amazing ..... Really great Job ....Love the video ....
Mat: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Me: 😭😭😭😭😭
Get a girl who looks at you like Mat
i’d love to experience this looks insane
540 kmh for real
I like the addition of the plant pots on the parcel shelf. Nice touch.
can I buy one of these of carwow?
9:51, when matt was saying 'want to see how much you can save on a new......' i thought he was going to say bugatti
Pretty short video tho i guess you hadn’t much time didn’t you 😄
Still not better than  Koneggseg .... still uses old fashion cam shafts inlet valves.  compared to  konegsigg camless electronic valve
Cant wait for the Tesla Roadster!
3,2,1 ad
The rear looks so good! Looks like Death himself made it
Can't wait for the next video from mat 😂
Look mat man so inspirational
If you want to see what you can save on a new Bugatti Chiron Super Sport, click on the........
Its kph not mph tho
Now THAT’S a colour!!!
This Christian dude just got me bored we need Matt and the cameraman only please
It's amazing how the chassis feels Soo composed at that level of speed. in older cars, things start to rattle as if it's going loose and come off. The chassis itself is an engineering master piece.
How much can we save on it using Carwow
My favorite car ever! 💙
What happened to the paint job?
9:51 I thought he was gonna say' Wanna see how much you can save for this Bugatti from carwow?' Lmao
Are those plant pots in the rear windscreen area????
"Before taxes..." 😄😄😄
Let's get a Koenigsegg on the channel it feels like you guys hate Sweden
Maybe try rimac concept 2 and you'll see the power over poor tesla
If you can make a powerful car why not show more  attention to the tires and other things that don't get as much attention that way you can make it last longer
Your not the first super car blondi is the first
In the end I thought Matt was going to say,  ''you want to see how much you can save on the Chiron, download the app'' 😆😆
Wasnt the porsche turbo s 2021 the fastest car matt? 🤔 get your facts straight haha
The title is wrong, it should say km/h instead of mph
How much does this piece of 💩 cost? I’ll wait for the Tesla roadster
"Ja i vork for volkswagen and help test zer vehicles"  *imagines him driving golfs and polos all day*
Im not in the UK so Carwow has no utility for me. But mate, I fucking love your car reviews I swear you are a hilarious genius
I just wish Mat would have made it a bit clearer that this car is capable of going over 300mph
How much can i save on a Bugatti Chiron Super Sport at Carwow?
Test Driver Robot - No problem Mat - Facemask upside down
Mat: What you think about this covid situation? Christian: YES.
Only did about 186 miles an hour
Yoooo I timed it, it’s about 3.00 secs 0-62 mph it’s not that fast!!!
Beautiful car 😍❤️
Mat needs to go to Germany and test drive the HGP Golf 7 R 3.6 BiTurbo because that thing clocked 354 km/h in the night time and the kit only costs 100K Euro plus the car and a few extras!
So what exactly HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
But are those real exhausts? No carwow stick of truth?
Hey Matt you should go in a top fuel drag car
Hi this is mat with Carwow and today I'll be driving the jesko!  Mannnnnn I hope so
How much G-Force hit their body? I wonder
Everyone: tHe EnGiNeEr OnLy SaYs YeS
title is wrong
Are there plants in the rear window!?
Mph? Speedo said kph.
I can hear that the Bugatti guy was a german Bugatti guy 😂😂😂👍
Engineer: "It only goes up to 300" 7:58: Speedometer shows 302 Me: "Well, that was a fucking lie wasn't it!?" 🤨
Matt is the definition of a kid in a candy shop. What a machine!!!
How much can i save on carwow tho
Is it true that when you go 300 mph for certain time it requires for the tires to be replaced?
you should be so proud of yourself
Very cool. I love how much Volkswagen has improved in the high-speed hypercar since the old Nardo from 18 years ago. Such a good performance machine!
I was just waiting for the end if he would say 9:50 ,  "See how much you can save on a new Bugatti Chiron today! Go to carwow.com"   Lmao 😂.
This Bugatti Chiron Super Sport is the fastest in the world -Supra- Nah fam 1,700 HP
You didn't go to top speed
well damn im not a big bugatti fan. but this this looks fucking awsome
That guy is the definition of a German
This is the most I've heard Matt saying "isn't it" in one video
He is sooo german
Is it just me or does the 0-50 seem slow? Would be interresting to put it up aginst a 911 turbo S 0-50.
But what’s the mpg
What a clickbait, it’s actually 300kmph not 300mph
Imagen owning that in england imagen the hate
you done kmh not mph  302 kmh is 187 mph   482 kmh is 300 mph
I  have never  seen fastest car from 100 to 300 km
Pls pls I need BUGATTI CHIRON SS VS LAMBORGHINI OR FERRARI OR ANOTHER CARS...PLEASE PLEASE
Can we also save some money on a bugatti on carwow?
How many reduction with carwow if i buy this car ?
bugatti: we're not chasing the fastest car record  also bugatti: we're chasing the fastest car record   meanwhile koeningsegg: laughs in jesko
Well I mean it’s not the fastest car ever, that goes to the bloodhound ssc
Sorry but isn't koenigsegg agera faster than Bugatti?
300 km/h not 300 mph. 😂
this dude speak like a robot in english but he fucking knows what he's talking about great great review
Next thing you know, collectors around the world buy the car, don’t drive it, 0 miles, and never let anyone see them
I really felt the speed simply by watching it.
Bit disappointing really...he didn't get the stick of truth out. 😂😂
AMAZING...!!! Thank you very much carwow !! 😉👍😊
It’s not 300miles 🤓it’s 300 km ✅
remind me when the Bugatti is 3500 im not paying a single penny above it
🤣 Matt was like a 5 year old on a Christmas morning, honestly I'm jealous haha. Thanks for an awesome video 👍🏻❤️
it always amazes me just how much more beautiful they made the chiron compared to the veyron
I thought he was about to ask how much I could save on a Bugatti Chiron 😂😂😂😂
Laughs in Koenigsegg
Shame. Clarkson, Hammond or May would have been allowed to drive it.
I couldn't find the car on the app, what kind of discount are we talking do you think?
gosh! its sixteen hundred matt, not six hundred!!!
"that's amazing machine"😏
The jesko abslout 😉koenigsegg
Does that not say 300kmh not mph??
That thing in matte black is fucking astonishing!
The back looks kinda strange
Esperando la traducción a español!!
Koenigsegg next
Brabus 800 (Mercedes GT 63 S)  Vs  Normal Mercedes AMG GT 63 S
Well done Matt even the screaming like a girl was cool !!!!!
Lucky gob sh*t*.
I was waiting for you to use the wooden stick..
Why do I feel like as soon as that Bugatii engineer turns around, Mat's gonna start doing donuts in that car
That’s an expensive golf
So it didn't actually go 300mph that  186.00mph that's ok
How much will I save if I use the carwow app to buy a Bugatti cheron?
I’m really happy for you
I wonder how this came about?
Damn... More than 200 kmh on the 3rd gear and my corolla wont do that even on 6th!
Why so serious
even if koenigsegg will beat this with a higher top-speed and i think they will i just love how luxurious bugatti’s are while having an insane top speed i also thing bugattis look better
Volkswagen Group FTW! I have an Audi S5 cabrio and I'm proud to have a car that's made by the same company that makes Bugattis. :D
This guy will star in Yes Man 2.
I think its 300 kilometer per hour. Not miles..
Niceee
but the speedo goes to 500 km/h?   *if i pay for the whole speedometer I'm gonna use the whole speedometer*
On carwow you can save upto 1 mill on a bugatti chiron sport......  I was waiting for that😂😂
Matt living the dream!!!!!!
But what about the Hennessy Venom?
Clickbait :D (its 300KMH not MPH)
Whilst wearing a muzzle... also it’s not the fastest in the world according to world records.
6:25 koenigsegg be like give me normal michelin tires i do 520kmh
As if Matt's followers can afford a buggatti.
Matt seems so happy and excited and the Bugatti engineer seems so irritated with him, giving short answers and not being very polite...
Disappointed Matt didn’t verify those exhausts with his stick of truth
Two words. Koenigsegg Jesko
What's the 0-60 number????
Por favor traduzcanlo a español
It was 300 km/h not mph/ But still imprssive.      I liked  Mats reaction :D
Yes
Who put the flowering plants in the back windows?
2nd Best carwow vid ever After him beating yiannys Lamborghini aventador with the 720s
I’ve reached 340 kmh on a e39 m5 from 2003 🥱
The Bugatti Chiron Super sport 300+ is my favorite car
You actually have been in the porsche 911 turbo s 10.1s
seems a bit lazy getting to 100kph. Extreme lag?
lmao that “I can’t remember” part killed me
Jesko said hold my beer.
TOYOTA LANDCRUISER IS BETTER...
Can we petition Tesla to get Mat into their new roadster for a ride-along?
Check my youtube channel
fact: the tesla is not the fastest car Matt has been. its the 2020 porsche 911 turbo s
Finally he did a Bugatti
Great, the acceleration from 100-300 is mind blowing. I would love to see "AutoTopNL" get his hands on this one ;D
4:56 wasnt the 911 turbo s the fastest to a 1/4 mile he has driven?🤔
So should I shortlist it or should I go ahead and buy it?
Amazing machine but I'm sorry its pig ugly.. matt black is possibly the worst colour in the world.  It looks like a lump of charcoal.. at every angle this thing is ugly, I just hope their final production cars look better..
imagine Mat driving a 300 mph car....
Grip? Matthias Malmedie
The acceleration was just amazing 👌
You can just tell that German is not impressed with the over excited puppy that is Mat
I'm disappointed that he didn't use his *specialist timing gear*
Matt forgot about the Stick test.
300 kmh no 300 mph
bro what was that laugh?
T50 is better and more faster
It is 300 kmph not 300 mph.
Fastest car you have driven is the Tesla? What about the 911 turbo s?
You mean 300kph, not 300mph😂😂
the UK has the worst hyundai's and kia's in the world. In the US, hyundai and kia is one of the best reliable  car company's in the US . Thats because in the US, they have the cars like the sante fe, the kona, the palisade, the stinger, the telluride and so much more! These cars are very reliable. But in the UK, they have the opposite....
Bugatti doesn't want that smoke from the jesko
Dont know how you wrangled it but well done matt.
he aint the first one though. Matthias Malmedie from grip has been in there months before.
Is the test driver the Stig? Same personality lol
How much can you save on this Bugatti?
Mat you should do a Doge Demond vs 911 Porsche
I made that 0-180ish mph in 16ish seconds =0
If you were telling me this is the new Batmobile I would believe it.
Can you believe that a F1 car reaches 200 km/h in half time? 1.6 liters.  It’s crazy
Fastest car yes, but not the quickest to 60mph, it shares the title with a 4 Door family saloon called... a Tesla Model S
What knuckleheads gives this a thumbs down.
Mind blowing 🤯
Regera is faster
Amazing.
Bugatti did not pass the vibe check when they didn’t let him drive 😤
Anyone else noticed two plants at the back of the car? No? Just me? Okay.
Mental thing! Great vid as always fella! 0-180mph (guessing roughly GPS) is 15 odd seconds! Nuts! I’ll see if I can get near that in my Supra when I get it back 😝🤣👍
When you sitting with somebody i na car for like probably 20minutes+ and you wearing a mask. Thats funny.
Yianni will be jealous :D
yes.
Best episode ever. Thrilling stuff mate. Thank you.
Is it about hyper cars with ultimate top speeds or hyper cars with say 200mph+ speeds and equally ultimate handling.......i guess what im asking is, does this car have 300mph better handling compared to its 200mph+ rivals?
Matt... where was your specialist timing gear? 😂
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: What Matt said in the beginning about the tyre cap's weight is completely correct. The tyre rotates at such speed when traveling at 300mph that it experiences some relativistic effects like increased weight. IN ADDITION, this car travels at 300mph; that is almost one third of the Earth's speed while turning. There is a small time dilation effect taking place which you can measure with a clock at the starting point synchronised to another clock on the Bugatti, but it's not nearly as pronounced when you're traveling at speeds of Mach 1 and higher. When you get into a Bugatti Chiron Super Sport, and travel at full speed, you jump the tiniest bit forward in spacetime.
Are the exhausts fake?
I feel like this car is faster from 200 to 300 then mine does from 0 to 100. then again it has about 1491 hp more and 1350 nm more torque
Where is the carwow Stick of Truth?
"Check to see discounts in carwow.co.uk". Yes I was definitely considering to get finance on this car!
5:11 mat on drugs
Take those stupid masks off🙄
Nice shorts. Why didn't you get the short ones?
someone enjoyed the ride.
What?!?
0:02:21 - because 275 mph is soooo much safer than 300 mph.?!?!?
How time for te 4 of mille?
I am glad I saw this on your channel, because you know how to describe things even with your moves without words :) Good job, and have more good stuff. God bless you
300kph..........just flexing :D bye bye Tennessee venom :D  this car is officially the FASTEST
Mat's laughter is pure joy.
That was 300 kmh not 300 mph ...
In the car community masks, sorry muzzle's, are being made easier to accept than the electric car transition! I know that Matt had to go along with things, I know the score-) Awesome video as always..but if we are honest the mask thing looks funny because it's a joke...its like weird film
That engine on the inside sounds like I'm playing Grand Turismo, I love it. Good going Matt, keep up the great, very entertaining reviews.
I am in disbelief
that was spectacular!
كابرس توين يقفل ملفة
No stick of truth on the shiny Bugatti huh... 😏🤣
Car journalists: "We have the best jobs in the world !" Bugatti Pilots: "Hold my Stella .."
It's 300 kmh not 300mph
from humble beginnings to driving bugattis
Except that car can’t do 300 because the one that did was modified and they haven’t had the production car to 300 yet so Koenigsegg still has the record
KM is not  MPH
:before 1 million views :D
300mph != 300 km/h :D
What’s the point of this video? The regular Chiron does way over 300kph
https://youtu.be/YnqHrl_14uc
300 KPH = 186 MPH, You’re welcome👍
can i save money on this car on carwow?
Can i get a discount on the Bugatti Chiron?
was really wishing i could’ve seen matt’s reaction going along at 300 mph and not 300 kmh
in title is 300mph, but it was 300km/h... HMMM what a mislead or intentionally fake clickbait
So is 300km/h not 300 mph..
he kinda reminds me of ken miles in the move ford vs ferrari, even looks pretty similar
Description is bullshit  First to go 300kph YES!!!!!  First to go 300 MPH...... still Waiting    Love carwow though 👍👍🤣🤣👍🤣  Edit *** I’m the first to go in the......... super click bait for the dyslexic........
When he said "The fastest car, in the world" I expected Jeremy Clarkson to show up and take over the video.
Thanks for replaying my ans for making the video with new car know one knows and sir please make the video of newest car know one has seen it again more.
Spend millions on a car to get interior door handles and control from a VW passat 🤦‍♂️
Am I the only one who thinks Matt should have really brang his *specialist timing gear* to check the quarter mile ?
Fix the title lol, that was KMH
You are not the first, do a youtube search ;-)
Not 300mph like your post states
all super cars can make 300km/h , but the 200-300 of this car is mega. Try to compare with a SVJ or 812 or 720.
Lucky Mat
4:58 dodge demon can make it  in 9.6 s 😂😂
it's better that search modified supra with ordinary petrol head driver that goes over 350 kph easly instead of engineer driver who suffer narcissistic personality disorder and mentions tire limit,road limit, brand limit vs.. only no limit for take costumer money. brah...
Koeningsegg is the fastes production car.
Wow very life like robot driver!
Yes! I can now save 5 cents with Carwow on a new Bugatti
That's a cool looking super car. Did Batman loan it out to ya?
Shortest 10 mins ever
What your verdict then Matt? Should I...   Consider it?  Shortlist it?   Or just avoid it altogether?
The guy from Bugatti sounds like a robot
no its the tesla roadster and devil sixteen my two fav cars
300mph??? No 300kph. Click bate
Actually laughed out loud when he wiped his brow 🤣
I was triyng to read the speed but i couldn't
When the engineer put his foot down is the quietest I’ve ever seen Watson 😂
Finally🔥💯
👎
No carwow stick of truth??
300kph not mph
Everyone comparing Koenigsegg with Bugatti, when they will never be able to even touch one...
He went 300kmh not mph.. clickbait at its finest
my civic is faster
Now wait for a ride in the Jesko Absolut. And this time you only went upto 186mph which dozens of cars are capable of.
if I was a Chiron owner, I'd be pissed to be honest
German: Bat ve hav alredy been trihundred tvice. Matt: Um yeah but I dont remember what it feels like
Finally he gets the chiron
Hey carwow, how you gonna get a discount on a Chiron?
Title says mph, whereas its km/h
The back reminds me of an XJ220
Why are there a couple of pot plants in the back ?
300km/h*
Click bait. Is not 300mph. But 300kmh.  My Honda Civic can do 300kmh.
So should we short list it or just go ahead and buy it?
Der Ingenieur ist ja mal so was von deutsch 😂
I am so exited to see how much I can save off on a Bugatti Chiron!
I am waiting for jesko absolute
He didn’t even go 200mph+
And they're wearing masks like douches just to satisfy the covid nazis.
Chiron ss vs roadster 2.0
your Tesla is annihilated by this thing. But it's 20 time more expensive also
When the car reaches 300kph using only %38 of its power
Haan bmw fanboy ! What u think of this  VW production  ? 😅
How do u drive Buggati? Just photoshop yourself in it 😂😂
Send doug to review it . But i love you also Mat
Bugatti 300 mph but when you buy it you can go MAX 275 because the car is restricted...lame.I’m pretty sure that the stock car for the customers don’t go to 300mph. Koenigsegg is the real deal.
3:50 go on Matt - do the center console wobble test, everyone is waiting for it as well as the stick of truth of course !
tbh koenigsegg is the only company that is about the same if not with bugatti
Good luck mat go for more your the best in review, so far some time I feel bad when it's not you review these cars super Blonde, showcases
He went from a Scooby last episode to a Chiron this week.. hmm lol
KM not Miles dears
Chirone vs Tesla  vs   paganni
Kinda disappointed koeinsegg will beat u again
Mat, I don't think I've never seen you so excited!
I want the driver job
Kmph and mph man😭😭
"It is the fastest car in the world" Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut: Am I a joke to you?
Because what ever driver wants when driving @ 180+ mph, is a passenger shouting “Aaaaagh, camera men!”, “Aaaaaaagh, drone!” 😂😂
That’s 300kmph not mph. BIG DIFFERENCE. Carwow and their clickbait strikes again
You've also got missing centre caps
Los simpsons lo hicieron de nuevo. "Aeroventilas"
Just awesome!!
Lol he does realize that KPH is different than mph right 😄😂
Were you in nardò?
Lol i went to the dubai motorshow of 2013 and met the (at the time buggati marketing manager but was going to start working with lambo instead. I was 6 years old. he shook hands with me and tokk a pic together and gave me an official poster for the veyron.
You should consider doing a Bmw M8 vs Lamborghini aventador vs Porsche 911 vs Mclaren P1 or  Senna , it would be a great video
Matt: 3, 2, 1, GO *Advert pops up on screen*
It’s fair to say Matt has made it! Legend.
0 to 100 it took 3.1 secs and from 0 to 300 it took 14.8 secs
Come on people.. anyone that owns a Bugatti... please let me do a review on it🤞🏻
Yeah nice car, hello from Cyprus. I never will have such car in my life, the engineer is from Germany, nice work he made, bravo 👏
No zero to sixty?!?!?!
Lets hope they actually put centre caps on the wheels when they sell it....
300kmph and not 300mph
Matthias Malmedie already took a ride in one
Hey Matt... Have you ever tried a sportbike that goes up to 200km/h (124mph) in just 6 second and you're on two wheels? That's what everyone should try... At least if they have the balls for do it.
Just came here for Matt
„Grip“ was the first team, a German car show.
You could feel his excitement through the screen 😂.
Lol 6:49 mat said 614 and it said 1614
It hit 200 mph like nothing😂
Mat tell me how much can I save on this car .... through carwow😂😂😂😂😂🤭
Complete click bait numerous journalists have been 300 km an hour
Thought it was a Lego car.
Mattimum speed.
Matt is so lucky, love your videos 😍😍
See Matt giggle like a little girl...
Hey Matt, Great going. Now off you go and review a Dacia Sandro.
It's km/h not mph
Anyone else read this as Matt was the first to go 300mph😂
you didn't go up to 300mph, you went up to 300kph, Nevertheless it is nice.
My car - 4th gear 80/kmh  Bugatti - 260 on 4th
Now we can really tell that it’s the fastest production car in the world
Misleading video title.
100% jealous now,  seen all the other cars you’ve driven and this is the one, the pinnacle of what can be done when a manufacturer says to hell with the cost, make the fastest production car in the world that’s also as comfortable and easy to drive as the dirty love child of a Golf and Rolls Royce Phantom.
Clickbait
This should’ve been the base Chiron model
Oh come on, we clicked to see 300mph not 300kmh, I can do that myself anytime!
I so excited about his reaction on Elon’s new Roadster
Sooooo you didn’t go 300 mph. You went 300 km/h. That’s 186mph. Yeah that’s fast, but it’s clickbait.
Give it to captain slowly
300kmh not mph, 300mph is like 482kmh
hahah the engineer is not even phased by it, just a normal day at the office.
Matt you lucky bastard.
I came here to see how much I can save on a  Bugatti.
Cars like this don't do it for me anymore.  I respect it though but would never want one.
Gorgeous
why don't you put it in a drag race
Thing goes from 200km/h to 300 km/h then most cars go for 0-100 lol
Started from the bottom now we way up
Are you sure you meant to say *300mph* (miles) not *300kmph* in the title?
I just waiting this from mat
looks like it has two flower pots on the back window
Thing is if I pay 3.5 million dollars on a car I’m gonna get that speed limiter off so I can do 300 mph not paying all that money and can’t hit the cars top speed
How much we can save through carwow on this Bugatti??
I still think Koenigsegg can smoke it but whatever
mat wearing a mask that’s says on the packet it’s non medical
Title says 300mph, slightly disappointed but still a great vid 👍
wheels look shit :D
That Germanness of the Bugatti engineer though
Sadly it's all rather ugly.
wrong thumbnail the speedo showing 300 kmph not 300 mph or 482.803  kmph.. please re correct.. thank you
Mat : So are we ...?  YES  But is ...? YES   didn't ..? YES  are ..? YES   yes ? YES ca.? YES
Those are the most beautiful seats I have ever seen
Stop click bait... we will watch the stuff anyways....
No carwow stick of thruth :’ (
The way he’s wearing his mask is pissing me off
Correct the mistake in the title is 300 km per hour and not 300 mph
Good for u Matt....it's a gorgeous car...
what is the discount on a Buggi at carwow?
Mat, you deserve it
Me: what is the top speed of the new Bugatti chiron?  The sound barrier: Do you asked me?
6:49 he reads out power wrong? He says 614 when the dial says 1,614?
Nobody:  Mat: Isn’t it?
I like how there is just casualy another Bugatti ss in the background 2:49
Haaaaaahaaaaaahaaaaaaahaaaaaahaaaaaaa.....
rattle can paint option.
Congrats Matt
3....2....1 GO!.... smart meter advert 🙄
Nice with 2 flowers in the rear window
French engineers the best 🇫🇷
Mat is one of the best car journalist
6:50... no Mat, not 614, but sixTEENhundred and fourteen 😃👍
Go to carwow save £1500 on a £3 million hypercar
Underground racers/tuners are laughing at this car :))))
Nice clickbait
nardo test track? I'm having  top gear nostalgia.
Can buy it in Kosovo
Matt in next video "this car is fast but not like the bugatti" 😂😂
Matts laugh kills me.
Can carwow save me 2k on this? If not I’m out.....;)
Click the link to know how much you can save on one of these through carwow ...
I wonder how many seconds head start you could give a Tesla and still beat it in a 1/4 mile with this..?
That was the true Matt if u wondered
Jesko : Lol
I love your video's, and so nice of them to let you jump in that car, but claiming it's the fastest production car... is it ? really ? ( ahum ahum ... Koenigsegg ... )
Gave the video a like, but totally disappointed for the clickbait title, 300mph turned out to be 300kmh...
Boba is better its a vw
Not really 300 mph, but rather kph, is it?
No stick of truth today? I bet the exhaust is fake like all VW do!
Apart from the makers of the bugatti The ceo the owners of bugatti aswell  Click bait much
Hey CARWOW, now it's my favorite video on your channel
I expected 300Mph not 300km/h :/
koenigsegg fan boys: looking from the sideline* 👀  wow that looks fun!
Matt: 3 2 1 go  YouTube Ad: MEATBALLS  okiee dinner has spoken
Fantastic
Quick reminder-> It’s 2020 = not impressed 🤭
For the first time.. Mat is the passenger in the whole video
Doesn't Kylie Jenner already have one ?
It look Like this car have 2 flowers in the engine bay? Lol
Believe me, i just watch carwow because of Mat Watson.
Matt: says anything The driver: YES
Did you change your underwear...?
Misleading title, they did not go 300 MPH
I wonder how much i can save on my Bugatti when buying on carwow.
CLICKBAIT. Didnt even get to 200mph
Congrats! I'm really happy to see Matt having this experience and being among the first car reviewers. Totally deserves it.
It looks like a Supercar Blondie video, but it's Mat. So we can say he's Supercar Brit-ondie
Really appreciate..art of legendary ..who have their own life statement .we are always with you guys..
thats 300 kilometres per hour not miles isn`t it
The front of the car is the best
So what do you do for a living?  I go around cruising in the world fastest car, nothin much.
Carwow ist the new top gear
They did a one way run on a test track, doesn't count.
Didn't you get 10.1 with the new porsche turbo s on the quarter mile?
This would have been so much better if yanni was the driver
You went 300 kph not mph! You only did 186mph
Ok that's fast but I wanted 300mph not kilometers
And then came the Jesko Absolut
Shame you could only go up to 300km/h :( But still insane!
That car is ugly as hell
Hennessey
So Matt, what's your final verdict. Should you, Avoid it, Consider it, Shortlist it or just go out and buy it!
do you want to buy one haha
A bit click baity but still cool
*km/h not mph
Matt was asked to leave driver seat. If I was there then they would have told “don’t even imagine about Bugatti”
You sure it was 480KPH?
Headline implies: man drives very fast car.  Reality: man is passenger in very fast car. Carwow – dredging the depths of clickbait.
What about the stick of truth test?!
The one drag race i'd like to see is a Nissan GTR VS a Hellcat SRT Challenger... Mine and my friends favorite cars (I assume the drag race cars are usually stock)
Congratulations for the promotion Matt!!😂
Stupid kids be like : haha told you the Bugatti was the fastest car In the world 0:05
I thought that koenigsegg Jesko was the fastest car i the world
It's good to be king!
The agera rs is faster than the bugatti because they didn't do a run in both directions so it's not eligable for the record.
The best picture in the world is a photo of a bugatti chiron doing a top speed, and next to it is a koenigsegg agera with a camera on top... Hehehe
Koenigsegg is coming for you guys look... #koenigsegg
I thought that Mat at the end will say "Wanna know how much you can save on a new Bugatti?" 😂 😂 😂
.. want to know how much you can save on a new Bugatti...🤪🤪
Turbo S would have it on ropes
Hitting the speedlimit of the racetrack.... okay
4:58 The fastest accelerating car that you drove is the new Porsche 911 Turbo S. It did 1/4 mile in 10.1 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4zilQLGdfs :) But it could be that this was filmed before that. Edit: We need a Bugatti in a drag race, at least the Veyron :)
Not 300 mph!    300 kmh! Фу пипец дешевое наипалово. Чувак с AutotopHL  почти на каждой тачке по автобанам Германии выжимает за 300 - 330, а тут 300 кмч по треку. Фи, мадам, где ваши манеры?
Anybody else notice the 2 boxes of Christmas lights on the rear parcel shelf? :-)
It’s kph not mph
Koeingsegg jesko is fastest
I was waiting for Matt to say: “if ur interested in buying a Bugatti Shiron, check out www.carwow.uk how much you can save on your new Bugatti!
I was really waiting for this matt do review of chiron
Carwow and Mats glow up
Congrats on first Bugatti Matt!! Btw is it miles per hour or kilometres per hour? The speed unit is in kmh hahahahahah..
I'm so happy for Matt!
Proud of you son
What happened during the 1:35 - 1:36 ? Where is the W16?
Tried to see how much i could save on carwow. Apparently if I need a discount Its not the car for me
You have no idea how long I’ve been waiting a Bugatti video. Absolutely love it.
Lol I’d like to see rappers buy this
300 MPH eh? Completely false title.
Video title is MPH but it's actually KM/H
Why are they wearing masks?
No offense man but jesko looks so much better than this.
You forgot your New Specialist Timing Gear
It wasn’t 300 mph, Mat ! It was 1.6 times slower....
Dream come true
Tesla : I'm fast Porsche : Hold my beer,.....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItCGU7BTBv8, see, I won Bugatti : Hold my whisky
Imagine going 300mph in this thing on the german Autobahn and still seeing a BMW in your rearview mirror flashing it's light :D
Cars youtubers and journalist this days: This is the new Ferrari Roma  Matt and Bugatii: I'm gonna end the Ferrari marketing team whole career
Matt being kicked out of the Bugatti  Me: This is the shortest review I've watched on carwow
What a casual talk by these two legends while piloting🤣 🤷🏼‍♂️  #Safety #Pc ✌🏼✌🏼✌🏼✌🏼
These lads are at work...it's hard to believe!!!
300 km/h not miles. I'm sure that will be in your memory for very long time. You should try Koenigsegg or rimac
Next race: Mat in a bugatti  vs Yannie in his aventador.  😅
Should you considered  Should you shortlisted  Or should you......... oh wait is sold out already 🤣
''any other car will seem slow right now'' experienced this once and can confirm, once you try a fast car any other car will seem slow 😤
holyyyy
Am I crazy or is it accelerating faster from 150-300kmh than 0-150?
Jesko or Chiron
How much can we save on Carwow for this car?
Misa Charoudin got an exclusive review on a more exclusive Bugatti 1 month before... Just sayin' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNMz5tfHW_k&t=453s
I never smiled so much in front of a youtube video. Thanks for sharing your experience Mat!
Does any one realise hes actually the second person not the first
Drag race under 10s. ?
😂😂🤣🤣😀😁😅😄😆😉😊😋😋😎🤨🤔🤔😶🙄😏😣😣😯😯😯😯😯😯
Does it go 300km/hr or mph?
This Bugatti vs the Porsche 911 turbo s
Christian is from Germany.....
5:04 cool☝️👍🚀🚀🚀
0:55 t r y p o p h o b i a
Congratulations Mats😂👌😤
303kmph MATT!!!!!
Planned new drag race Buggati Chiron 300++ v Porche 911 turbo s 😂🤘
Oh boy.. now just imagine the acceleration that would be in Koeniggsegg Jesko.
Маски то зачем😷
Mat I like you but you only went 300km/h
Do Carwow do Bugatti deals?
Oi, you went 300 kmph!
Not the ”fastest car in the world”, just inspired by the prototype that went 304mph. That prototype was not a production car and holds no records whatsoever as it only went in one direction and was a heavily modified non-production car. Seriously Mat - pathetic lack of research and you should know better
Konnegzeg laughing in the corner*
How rich do you have to be to daily this monster?
And the type of people who buys this car will spend 90% of their driving with a Bugatti Chiron Super Sport will be around posh alleys in London or in Dubai
THE CAR HIT 100KM/HR IN FREAKING FIRST GEAR. FUCKING HELL.
Matt: "3 2 1 GO" bye bye to 20 years of car journalism
speedometer acts like revs!!!!
How much can i save on this car from your app  huh Matt?
I really love these Bugatti cars for what they stand for. But this one looks like they took the bumper off the normal Chiron and put a longer bumper in its place (look at the rear end of the chassis way before the actual end of the car @1:59 ). Otherwise it looks gorgeous.  And no, you have not actually been to 300mph. It was 300km/h (186mph). But you've been there fast.
I hate the color
Matt: Long well performed question German: YES
Mat, since you're in Europe, you could review this Golf here in Germany  It's faster that this Bugatti 0-300 https://youtu.be/AoDDODh5Ras
See you guys in a couple years when this pops up in your recommended
Look at the speedo @4:07 , it's very hard to use the whole gauge.
Hannibal Lecter just bought a Bugatti
"Every other car will seem slow..." That's what Matt just said and will say it again when he reviews the Koenigsegg Jesko😆
Now I wish Mat (as a passenger) tries a 1500hp Supra, UGR lambo or Alpha GTR on a straight line! That would be scary AF 😂
Chiron : 0 kmp Matt : SNEEZE Chiron : 303 kmp
I like the pot plants in the rear window..
cool yeah but still a passenger...keep up matt;)
This accelerated as fast to 300 as my car to 100 🤯
koenigsegg > bugatti
You Jammy git... ha ha
You would think a car reviewer would mention the air ducts in the wings are a throw back too the eb110 🤣
Nice misleading / clickbait title there matt and carwow !
we need a drag race whit a chiron 🧐😂
#perfection
I wonder how much I can save on this Bugatti at carwow? 🤔
Nardò 😍🇮🇹❤️
How much can I save on one of these?
Love the accent of the Volkswagen Guy :)
It's 300 kph not mph 🙄
Matt putting in ads so he can afford this....some day :) and did he just put a sex joke at the end 🤨
*Ground-breaking will be 500km/h*
Speedo on that car is faster than my rev gauge
Take the mask off Mat 🤦‍♂️
Should I buy it or shortlist it?
„SS” is just not good shortcut for car with German DNA🤨
No checking the exhausts with a branch?!
Take off those silly masks...please
Beautiful plants behind the sits
That “twitch” from 30-60kph on the speedo is insanely quick.
Chipped 1.9tdi is still faster.
Well, the laugh from Mat says enough!😆
Anyone else notice the plants in the back window? What's up with that?
nice shirt Matt
Lol look at all the salty Koenigsegg fanboys 😂.
300km/h not 300mp/h!
First time I seeing you driving Bugatti
Ok so where’s the stick of truth
I came to see it go 300mph smh😐
[Skip Ads]
no luhc control :D
What no stick of truth? I'm not angry Mat, I'm disappointed...
Another day and another VAG plug by mat and his sponsors.
Should of used the carwow stick of truth on the exhausts just to make sure
👎300 km, 400 km.,👍❤️❤️❤️
Great vid.. well done mat
Mat congratulations 🍾🎈🎊🎉 and well deserved if u ask me all the way from ZAR 🇿🇦
Amen. The closest thing to this is the Tesla so I guess some day I will be able to feel it.
oh Matt thank you so much for this moment
Might be still a development car but I damn near cried, it's so beautiful
A dream car ^^
Still confused. Is that a Speedometer or Tachometer ?
Hmmm is it just me or someone else think there's something wrong with the title. 😕😕
Matt: What an amazing car! Buggati Engineer: Yes!
In the beginning I thought the Bugatti had a limit on his words. Dude was brief with this answers!
I must admit. Matt's vedios have really being helping with my sanity...but his petrol loving, nature ending demonic soul has just been unmasked.
Such a shame we can't properly see the expression on your face 😯
300 mph  is not the same as 300kmph
Mat: How fast does the car go? Driver: Yes...
Kph your video says mph.
Bad boy car
Wait how much can i save through carwow buying this car?
We need Jay Leno to review one of these in the US, very beautiful!
The 50-100 is actually faster than the 0-50 time.
I saw 300 km/h not 300 mp/h
No carwow stick of truth?!  Disappointing.
Seems like it is sluggish for a half a second off the line but then explodes with power I wish it would do that right off the line
But... But how much can I save on the bugatti
Mat: “I’ve been reviewing cars for 20 years and nothing just felt like that.”  2 seconds later: “So it’s like the tesla...”
300 kmh = 186 mph   I had no idea either, Just thank me with a 👍  Your welcome btw
Jesko is lurking👻
There's a guy in Greece with a Porsche 911-996 tuned by 9ff with 1400 hp and it goes 0-300 in 6.8 seconds imagine that
No Stick Test for this?😜
We get it! You are a motoring journalist not a YouTuber. Please stop saying it every 5 minutes.
‘Fastest car in the world, EVER!’ Yeah, that’s usually how they work 😂
Its 300 kmph not mph
Pity, Mat hasn’t used a stick of truth this time 🥺
Hahahaha that was a funny intro. Loved the Bugatti Engineer part very much.
Что там в моторном отсеке за пучок проводов??? Это же стремно.
I was hoping to hit 450 kmh at least.
VW❤️
Centre caps removed for weight saving?
isn't he from ford vs ferARRI?
When this thing launches, it sounds like a damn jet engine. The turbos spooling up are just insane. It is also surprising how tame the engine sounds while in the cabin. Its very smooth sounding. I have heard the exhaust sound in multiple videos and its nothing like that. Quite the contrary actually. I just love this car.
As soon as mat sez go a Nissan advert comes on how amazing
The description say 300 miles per hour but the actual video shows 3000 km /hr....
Since this was before you reviewed new 911 turbos can you tell us in the next video how does those two compare since they are two best gt cars in the world and also the fastest
Are these green plants visible behind the passengers?
from 0 to 250 kmh in less then 10sec🤣😂 more than you can afford
But Mat how much can we save on this car through carwow app?
They only went 180 mph not 300 mph hard hard clickbait LOOOL
I could feel Mat was dying to drive that car. Not yet Mat 😁
That is 300 kmph not mph
The longer tail suits it so good!
300 KM/H !!!!!! not MPH
The fastest car is the Agera R
Of course the engineer is german 😂
From 0 to around 160 - 170kph this is actually slower than the 992 Turbo S and the Taycan Turbo S; it's from 200kph onward that it takes off. Very cool engineering, no doubt, but if you're spending this much on a car it must suck to be beaten off the lights (or anywhere on public streets) by a car that costs 7 or 8% of its price...
dont die mat LMAOOOO
it was 300km/h not 300 MPH :):):):)
300 KMH not MPH grrr
still waiting the 300mph
I dropped everything i was doing to watch this 😂totally worth it
wowwwwwwwww
best of carwow ❣️
To everybody who has the dream of buying a bugatti, may our dreams come true.
but why does the title say 300mph if it was kph
Isn’t it?
Matt: How fast is this car? Bugatti: Yes.
Wooooooooooooow fly it.....
So basically this may be the fastest Bugatti but it’s not an actual production version. So no people it holds no records.
So it went 300KPH and not 300MPH.. quite a difference between the two..
That orgasm laugh priceless but it’s not that quick but hell fast
We are waiting the review of the DEVEL SIXTEEN 😂😂😂😂😂
Why so many dislikes?? 🤨🤨🤨
As much as I love this car, you’re paying over 3 million dollars for this machine, why the hell does the manufacturer have control on if when and where your allowed to use the max power of *your own machine* who cares if it’s dangerous, if I pay for it I want to control it, I don’t want there to be any sort of speed limiter on it, if I die that’s on me....
This is my favorite car. I❤️BUGATTI.
1:35 wierd jumpcut. But this car us amazing
I will not stop dreaming!
Is it just me or did it seem like he didn’t fully hit the gas from zero. Seemed like he eased onto full throttle.
We ned a drag race 😎👌
Petition for Mat to play Joker in the new Batman film
1:35 Who else saw a cut there
Im getting chills while watching
The adverts just killed that 3,2,1 Talk Talk 🤦‍♂️ what an experience though
No one:                                                                    12 yo supra fanboy: supra is faster then this
Twin turbo Lambo owners : LOL
I couldn't have thought of anyone more worthy than Matt Watson 🔥🤣🙌I never get tired of the content, keep doing what you've been doing. To your team also👏
Неудачная плёнка не красиво смореться !
That guy is pretty bald, but his head will never be as aerodynamic as Chriatian Von Koeningsegg's.
300mph !! 300kmh
€3.5M, but this is how much car wow can save you on a new Chiron super sport......
German engineers = masters of speech asceticism
Just like a kid in a candy store!!! Yes, Matt's excitement was contagious! That thing is blistering blinding fast!!!
He sould try bobas golf
🙄
To bad the Chiron is ugly 🤫
If you want to own this car you also need to buy a gas station XD
Interesting how the driver is an AI robot - such cool tech!
Click bait
Did he use LC ? Seems a bit slow 0-100 kmh  Love the car tho so dont wanna be a hater or anything.. : P
Misleading title.  It us a very fast car no doubt, but it is 300kph, not 300mph as the title says.
His friends: Where are you in this new Forza game?  Him: I'm right here! Waiting for hours...Maybe your computers are bad, mine has 16000 horsepower!  His friends: Alright...Why is your speakers so loud? It's like a real car engine is actually running.  Him: I don't know. This new Forza game sucks, my Bugatti is running it weird, I can't even see you guys, it's super fast though.  His friends: *Wanna exchange PCs*
how much can save on this veyron?
7:28 Christian reveals he's NOT a pre-production robot engineer! 😂😂
Unfortunately it accelerates slower than Ferrari SF90 Stradale from 0 to 200 and 0 to 300 is slower than Koenigsegg so i already know that Koenigsegg will easily beat it's top speed not to mention this one is still not a production car so Koenigsegg still holds the record
Thats Cap, I was going 369MPH the other day. The cameras just werent on! 🐬🐬
Like your channel lot but 5 adverts in 10 minutes that's bit too much now Carwow!
Mat is hilarious
“Dad, can we —“ That engineer to his kids: *YES* “But we didn’t even —“ *YES* “How do you know what we want to ask??” *IT’S IN THE DETAILS*
300 mph is 482 kmh lol ... you went 300 kmh not 300 mph ... clickbait video
**300 kph*
1600 hp? Wow I remember my 2002 Celica had 140 hp. I would’ve smoked that super crap because my car weighed less!
According to the speedometer , its 300kmh not mph
100-300 11.11 sec... Thank me later
It is 300 kmph. Not 300mph Refer 7:56
0:26 that face😂😂😂 mat you're awesome buddy... Love from india.
God dawn
did you mean 300kph and not miles per hour
It's a Carbon Dream!
Can you imagine spending all that money for a 300mph car and then finding out it's restricted so it can't actually do 300. 😭😂
6:27 Naruto was happy to appear in the subtitles
Ofc that the engineer is german
He was like a little kid playing with his toys😂😂😂 I love him
Matt: 3..2..1.. GO! Porsche ad: bonjour
How much money can I save on a Bugatti Super Sport on Carwow?
bestcar.at.ua
pjp-exclusive.ucoz.net
Everyone complaining that they didn't go 300mph, read the title again lmao.
Where is 300 mph??????
My cries when I bought the Normal one 😭
The driver is the Stig’s outgoing brother.
Liar, it’s limited at 300km/h that’s still a long way from 300+ mph
I'd have the Gordon Murray T50 over this bloated misbegotten monster any day.
My Audi TT goes faster
Wow. . .😍 Lucky you. . . Was really surprised with this. . .❤️
isn’t it?
wonder how much i can safe on a new Bugatti on carwow from one of their trusted dealers.
Mat : 3....2...1..go! -  *YouTube ad starts Perfect timing 😂
The title says 300mph but its 300 kph
New drinking game. Every time Mat says "300mph" you have to do a shot
German driver?:D
Matt that was 300 kph if I'm not wrong, but any how we would like to watch your all vlog,
If you have a Bugatti chiron now can you race it with other cars?
Everyone: Why do I have to go back to work? Test driver & Matt: I'm not complaining...
Nice from Bugatti taking their pot plants for a ride...
300kmp not 300mph
I think Matt needs a cigarette after that ride🤣🤣
“Click on the top link to save up to 3000 pounds on a new Chiron” 😂😂😂😂😂
I never knew Valtteri Bottas is working as test driver for Bugati as well.
Congratulations mat!
Koeningseg jesko?
Its Kmph right?
Try the latest Koeningsegg
👍🚀🚀🚀
Great video, isn’t it ?
Didn’t the mclaren get the best quarter mile time at 10.3 or 10.1 or something ..?
Amazing
When Matt said 321 Go. An add came up
That’s only 186 miles per hour
8:20 This is the first time i see a road sign which set the speed limit at 240.
I didn't know they allow pornography on YouTube!!
I'm pretty sure the Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut is the fastest car  Fact: it's top speed is 530+ Km/h  (330+ Mp/h).
When Matt gets excited, he sounds like a girl 😂
Wow, this was bloody amazing Mat!😸😸
Granpa Matt  shows this video to his grandchildren 30 years from now, they will ask what's up with the face mask lol
Looks like there is two potted plants in the back.
TBH 0-60 acceleration was kinda laggish for a 1600 HP car. 911 Turbo S blows it out of the water in that department
I was smiling like an idiot throughout the video so I guess good job
So happy For Matt
I’m not gonna lie when i saw the test driver I thought its christian koenigsegg even how he sounds, a little bit trim though.
Wow, Bugatti is soooooo serious, going to exclusive test track driving only 300kmh with lots of excuses because serious... Autotop nl takes Porsche gt2 on public autobahn and drives 340. Bugatti sucks.
I say the new Porsche still smokes it in a drag race
My favorite car😍😍
What a joy seeing mat this happy. The acceleration probably wasn't the only hard thing... If you know what i mean
What are this for awful doorhandles? 🙈🙊
I think someone got carried away with the title - 300kmh not mph... Bloody fast nonetheless!
The way that driver gripped the steering wheel was like it would slip out of his hands any moment.
Ok
Haha er ist Deutsch
Supra can recording it😂 Follow @imporrtt on Instagram
300mph or 300kmph?
I thought they were going to reach at least up to 400km/hr.
300 kph not mph BIG difference bruv
Wow from 200 to 300 km/h it is astonishing
wow
Nearly un subscribed due to  Too much smugness 😁
How much discount can you get on a Bugatti on carwow? Punch in your details to find out!
Matt, you are the best!!!
How many "isn't it?" did Mat ask the engineer? 🤔
I thought they were plants in the back
Wait a minute, why does this one still have the hydraulic wing, the one in the Bugatti video didn’t!
Matt. Please stop laughing like a 10 year old girl.
How much can I save on a Chiron supersport through CarWow?
It is 300 KMPH and not 300 MPH. But still very fast.
Waiting for yiani to buy it
What he say it both super comfortable and most fast this the special in the Bugatti 4:47
i want to see tesla model S p100d vs bugatti chiron
i dont know but for me its a very slow acceleration
Hahaha. Mat is so excited. No carwow deals? A 200 thousand less or something?🤣🤣
Brilliant Matt, you lucky dog
And here comes the 12 year old fanboys who knows nothing about engineering and jumps on bandwagons
Matt, you are one lucky bastard😂😂😂😂😂
I notice that you didn’t ram a stick up the exhaust on this car 😂😂
title is wrong. it is 300kmh not mph.
Come on Matt. You went only about 186 mp/h (300 km/h).
Buy a formula 1 car and a Prius, instead. Way more fun.
Sure it was 300mph and not 300kmh?
am i retarded? isn't that 300kmh and not mph ?
Noticed never used the ",stick of truth " on this one...🤣🤣🤣
WOW,this is insane.What kind of animal is that?! Amazing really amazing.
300 kmh not mph 😅 but still very impressive!
Who else thought it looked like two pot of plants in the engine bay? 😂
Why’s this guy socialising like he’s tryna use the most efficient number of words 😂😂
Matt forgot to link where we can save X amount of percent save on a Chiron.
Jesko Absolut is faster
when it goes 250-300 about as fast as 0-50
World's fastest car that's restricted.. I bet that the jesko won't be restricted....
How it’s get to 250 on short time wow
@5:00Matt you forgot you did 10.1 in Porsche 911 turbo S
why do people dislike mat Watson's reviews? idk🙄
No guys, the title is correct.It's not click bait. The car is CAPABLE of 300MPH. Matt never said he went 300MPH while in it.  Totally accurate to say he was the first to go IN the 300MPH Bugatti.....not DRIVE it at 300MPH :)  Loved the enthusiasm. Not a bad day at the office!
Matt is feeling like a kid again.
Okay Mat, Take it to the Drag Strip!
congrats matt
Now I'm jelly
Its arrogant guy matt its a nice person you never ,and never has speak with this idiot guy.
Matt you didn't mention how big the boot was🤗
"fastest car in the world, ever".   *Laughs in Koeningsegg*  Edit(because i know they'll come for me): Don't you guys ever get tired of seeing Koeningsegg do a random road test with a car they never bragged about and just effortlessly smash records? Seriously. They just developed a new engine system that gets 600+hp out of three cylinders. They'll just make one with 6 cylinders  and do an innocent road test just to prove a point, again, and again and again.
Where's the 300+ mph??? I only saw 190...
So can I save an average of 5000 quid on my new Bugatti?
Bugatti needs to let Matt drive the car .
Wait it actually does 480km/h? That's just illegal
Chiron Pur sport : https://youtu.be/nNMz5tfHW_k
That Engineer is kinda dick isn't he
Video call 186.411 MPH not 300mph
Just smiling away at Matts reactions
matt being a kid. then again so would anyone in that car going so fast
Does anyone  else laugh when he laughs...
What about königsegg which is faster
Can I get a deal on one through CarWoW?
Probably still lose against yanni
This channep grow so so fast! Good job Matt and carwow!
At first i thought in the background there are flowers in the trunk/engineroom and than i was like ok ok thats fake haha
8:02 wtf are plants doing in the rear mirror
I REALLY LOVE MAT'S REACTION ON EVERY PULL  THEY MAKE...
That’s a pretty misleading title.
Loved Matt’s reaction 😂 It’s exactly how it should be 😃
"The first to go 300kph" not MPH.  There's a difference. A big one. 😂
King Chiron
Click bait? I see 300kmh not mph
Well that’s an instant click
Looks like you walked down the street, saw Bugatti and start reviewing it.
Is there a pop out banner dealer savings?!
Mat but in your video racing the Porsche 992 Turbo S against the McLaren 720S the Porsche recorded a time of 10.1s and you said it is the fastest car we’ve drag raced
A 300mph-car that is limited to 300kmh. Somewhere  in sweden somebody is laughing out really loud..
fun fact: that car goes to 60mph while in first gear.
No stick of truth? 😂
5:10, that's how you know it's a good car, when carguys giggle like little girls.
No! Koenigsegg TOP!
yeah btw it was 300 km/h not mp/h
how annoying is Mathew laughing,  just trying to reverse the video in order to see the speed gaining of the car and the moment is being ruined by his annoying laugh any way lets move on. I think the new porsche 911 turbo will beat this ca fo the fist 50 meter
I thought at the end of the video Mat was gonna say: “wanna see how much you can save on a new Bugatti Chiron?” And low key I was hoping to click on a button and save £3.6k on one
I saw 300kmh title says 300mph. Lame.
Is it me... or does the acceleration from 0 -60 kph feel kinda sluggish? I know he wasn't using launch control... probably something to do with testing and pre production car... but still..... If you look at a tesla model S p100D launch... it trows it's occupants back from the first few kph.... I knew the chiron was going to be a bit laggy... but this just looks too much to be normal.... imho....  I could be wrong... correct me if I am :)
Mat we are proud of you 😍😍
shmee did it first
Ordered mine ages ago 👌
Fastest you have been is in Porsche 911 turbo s isn't it ?? 1/4 mile in 10.1 seconds
Km/Hr Matt*
Clickbait !!! He never hit 300mph. He purposely wrote mph instead of kph which is what he actually achieved.  Which is not impressive .
I wonder how much I can save on a Bugatti from carwow?
Drag race it against a Jimney
man im just watching  and thinking im never gona afford probally in my dream
km/h no mph   putaclick
funfact: they were going 300 kph not mph
Dear Santa 🎅........
Omg man just how many ads ...
That's not the fastest car in the world.
Mat: How fast does it go? Christian: Yes.
Hi from Durban South Africa Mike Watson! We came here today just for the result of a let’s take a break from the highland of johnnesburg alright!? Yes we did drive respectful of Covid as we don’t wishit upon us. This is a great test of a video of a car the Bugatti is a fast car bud just as the moon landing this could of been a fake or it is real we don’t know. Ones when iwas a youngster I did have a opel kadett whois speed monitor was an overachiever such as at perhaps a true speet of 150 it would say look: 180! Oh the fun and then we would even play the music loud bud the Sheeron itis without a sound system. What am I saying? Iam saying look, wind, loose or draw, we all end up in the grave one day so let’s have fun today. Blessings mat we bless you I’m glad I saw this movie today as the result of note seeing you for a day is  like the same as alright you’re wearing a tshirt bud where is your pants? It is just wrong! Greetings mat. Good to see you!
mustang, challenger, camaro,  left WhatsApp  group..
311k views in 3 hours. Impressive.
So I think you should just go right ahead and buy it.
What to see how much you can save on a new Bugatti Chiron Supersport? Click on the pop up banner...
Mat, we both know you aren't used to used to reviewing VW Golf's
On my region ♥️♥️♥️
Did my high ass skip to much or is it clickbait cause counter says km/h?
It’s 300 kilometres an hour he does here not 300 miles an hour! Still made up for you✌️
Matt u a such a nice guy..u wish everybody could experience this..!! I like u
Jesko is a must!!
So why exactly can't I check the prices on a new Bugatti Chiron Super Sport on carwow dot com, Mister Mat So-Called Watson?
Didnt think anything could look better than Manny's Chiron. This ...this..this is.....damn, no words.
CLICKBAIT . UNSUBSCRIBE
Goes 60mph quicker than the McLaren F1 and has 1000 more horse power! Poor engineering when you think about it. All Bugatti do is add extra horse power to go quicker and the thing weights alot
1:35 he says w12 LOL think he was too excited
Did it pass the carwow stick of truth?
7:42 you can basically see the engineers shit eating grin from behind the mask 😂
It’s not 300 mph it’s 300km
Wassup with the flowers in the back of the car??
Never heard Mat laugh like that, Genuinely happy for you mate. Don't mention Tesla and Bugatti in the same sentence again!!
But can I find this car on carwow ?
Wow 😯 🤣👍
Want to see how much you can save on a new..... whaaat?    Oh... not Bugatti
Quickest car you tested was the new 911 turbo s
Just wow
5:12 my reaction when I  had my first o$&#gasm
Unexpected stuff only Mat can do... Be the first journalist to ever be in that car, he himself being in a bugatti for the first time.... Yet wearing shorts n tee😂😂😂😂😂
Anyone else notice those plants in the back of the car?
Look at 5:28, the lovely flap
I believe there's a difference between 300mph and 300km/h, isnt't it?
Everyone saying Jesko>chiron doesnt really seem to get it, A bugatti is a car you can use to drive in normal traffic, soft suspension, quiet, luxurious, and finished on par of a rolls royce. A Jesko will feel like asupercar all the time, a bugatti can feel like a luxury sedan while also being able to reach these insane speeds. Compare it to Rolls Royce vs Bentley. The bentley is quicker, it has flamboyant styling etc...But The Rolls is just more special
Bit, you Drive 300 km/h / kp/h and Not 300mp/h .. i think the Titel is clickbait af ...
KMH NOT MPH!
That car goes 0-160 faster than my car can go 0-60
In the end I was waiting for "To see how much you can save on a new Chiron - go to carwow"
Turkhis like
Who came to watch this video thinking Mat Watson gonna drive this car to 300 mph....    Reality : He is the first one to only sit in                   Bugatti Chiron Super Sport.
Who goes 500km/h？
Mat we want a drag race with the Chiron
That engineer looks like Joe Achilles 😂
Didn't anyone notice it looks like a budget Chiron without those wheel hubs and those sticker marks on the bonnet
Switch from 1st gear to 2nd gear at almost 100km/h... Basically going on the highway  on 2nd gear.
Mat’s next next daily
Wooow...I live in Lecce (south Italy) near Nardó and I hope to see this missile live 🚀  although I prefer the lighter Koenigsegg by far...
WAIT!!!!  Your title says 300 MILES PER HOUR!  It's NOT, it's 300 KM/H!  HUGE difference!
Lucky mat... Your reaction is just awesome bro. Feels more n more to have a ride in Chiron one day
I like how they used the same steering wheel to the veyron
The exhausts look that way because the concept of them were designed around an F40 fighter jet (I think)
Did you sneak your RaceBox along for the ride? 🚗💨⏱
5:02 great reaction
I am undecided between this car or toyota prius
You seemed very overwhelmed while reviewing this car.  It’s just a MACHINE AFTER-ALL!
The mask clamps over your nose you know.
Tesla would be faster off the line
You when shit gets real when speedo max out at 500km/h
isn´t it ?
You mean 300kmh ?
Never have I ever seen you so excited, I love it
It's 300km/h not miles per hour..
erm no offence mate, is it 300mph or kmh?
Mat you lucky Bastard!
300 kmh is not the fastest car in the world......
It's amazing man
French ohh I mean german engineering
You pay for 300 and they only let you have 275? No thanks, I’ll pass...
Are those plants in the back of the bugatti…
😂😂😂
I went on carwow.co.uk and I can’t happen to find me a Chiron on any sort of deal 🤧
Want to see how much you can save on a new bugatti click the link in the description box below to find out..........   Me ill have 2 😅😅😅😅
damn
Isnt it kmh not mph? Cuz 300 mph=480 kmh~
Hahahahaha! Loosing your Bugatti cherry😂😂😂😂
The rear view mirror is actually useless
Congratulations, Mat!
Chiron>Jesko The "I was the first one" caught my attention
Wonder how many people skipped to the driving part
That reaction . . . 😂🤣😂🤣😮.
Make a single video on lambo
So should I consider it or shortlist it?
What the hell is up with these  dislike guys?...
well Matt that was only 186 MPH...!!! even clickbait has its limits...
No ur not
9:52 "want to see how much you can save on a new Bugatti?"😅
Mph or KPH? Title says MPH, dial says KPH
Its 300Kmph not 300Mph...
I think, suddenly i have an ultimate urges to pop my very own bugatti cherry too
How much can we save on this car at Carwow?
Looks like a couple of plant pots behind their heads
👍
How much can we save on a chiron ???
Didn't even go 300 mph, what a waste
It is 300 km/h not 300 mp/h payasoooo
Its longer because it make streamline aero for more speed will the normal chiron is short can create blunt or Wake Vortex creates a hole which causes car  Turbulence or we can say air doesn't reach behind the car going high speeds causing  Vacuum!!!
This guy is so German lmao
This engineer feels like a programed robot 🤖
Nice one, Matt!
The car is matte like Matt
300 Km/h  or  Mph ? big difference
You mentioned Tesla as the fastest to a quarter while 911 did it in 10.1
Mat : how much this car can go       Bugati engineer : yes
More like 300 km/h, right?
Mph or kph
Thiiiiisssss is the car none of us can afford
Bellissima macchina
Chiron vs venom f5 vs jesko vs Tesla roadster
Thumb Down because of ur disgusting masks. Omfg
Matthias malmedie was first @carwow
no stick of truth
"Ι'm the FIRST to go in the 300mph Bugatti Chiron Super Sport *WORLD EXCLUSIVE*" Μatt mate, don't act like that blondie bitch you are better than that.
I want that one!
How much can I save through Carwow on this Chiron?
His laugh made me dying, actually 10 mins later i cant stop loool
0-25 mph: okay... this is like a Tesla... 25-200: WHAT THE DFSHGKJSDVRNGKDJGKJDGKCJGHDJGFKJHGDFSKJGHKS 200-TOP SPEED: OH MY GOD THIS IS LIKE A TESLA S P100D FROM 0-60 HOLY
That was awesome
Let's say it together....300 KPH  Nowhere near 300 MPH
How fast does the car go? Bugatti: yes
300kmh and not mph
Im really happy today for Carwow.... Never change Matt.... ❤
Its not even 300 mph😑
Where are the 300 mph?
Wondering was it 300 km/h or 300mph?
Love to see a drag race.  Bugatti Chiron SS vs Mclaren Speedtail vs Rimac C2
I was waiting for your final verdict
Why would anyone buy it
Kid scares when drone flies up during 300km/h speed hitting😂😂
I’m kind of sad you did not even use the stick of truth on this car 😂😂
Why does the speedo say kph
300 kph not mph****
Don't say 300mph, when you barely went 300kph. Clickbait!
The driver speaks like the Terminator
Wonder how much I can save on one of these with car wow 🤪
Fastest 0-100 tesla? Matt...you drove the new Porsche Turbo S.
Its km/h not mph. Meh
Come on guys , you’ve gotta respect the Bugatti the most!
nah the fastest was porsche  911 turbo s 2020 10.2 secs not a tesla
It was interesting to watch Matt, but it will be more interesting to watch when the car can open all its potential and possibilities and the speed of course.
And that my friends is true and pure excitement felt by Matt. Could tell he was genuinely blown to bits with excitement
Goes like a spaceship.
Man you are so lucky to get a ride in that, I'll be happy with 200 mph,I don't want none of that 300 stuff 😁
Drag
And the power mirrors taken from VW Golf...
That's 300 KM not Mile huh
ZETS WOT ITZ MADE FORR!! The most German engineer ever... WE COLLECTTT DATA TO INPRUVE ZE CAR FÖRSER! Great video!
Strange video....look like a joke
Bro race with yanimaiz using chirron
Hey Matt i wana see how much i can save on a new Bugatti Chiron Super Sport :) :) :)
Warum kann ich hören das der Bugatti Mann ein deutscher ist hahahah
Got excited for 300mph but anyway still an amazing video
Finally I see matt in a chiron
6:52, 614 hp Matt ? You sure mate ? 😂
Overhyped bloated car. Koenigsegg is the BEST.
Sound issue
Imaging if there were no speed limiters  Matt:😲😲😅lets see again what it's like to go 304mph
any discount on Carwow.co.uk?
It's 0:39 and i am just leaving, ffs
**Yh but the bmw I drive is much better**
Zooommmmm and disappears...... Bugatti cherry well lost, Mat!
Matt don't you know difference between 300 mph and kph or is it a typo
How much money can I save with carwow if I buy this?
its fast until car from sweden comes to break record
The car looks mental in satin black
Well, sad it's out of sync for me
It’s a 8L W16 quad turbo lol
Did anyone count how fast 0-300?
How has my man Mat done this again ?!
Did he really just do a voiceover for the first 2.40 min
Km/h not Mph
Why are there pot plants in the rear window?
I realized they are not wearing helmets they are wearing masks. Like the most dangerous thing on this video is covid ;P
Where 300 miles, i saw only 300km
the title says 300mph the speedo says 300 km/ph hmmmmm
Koenigsegg Jesko: 🥱
It only costs 16'000 EUR to experience that on a motorcycle in Germany. ^_^
Kph not mph
That speed to 300 is so quick
Matt that's a lovely machine but are we getting the new Kia Sedona
I want to know what the test engineer drives into work
Who’s the robot next to him?
The Header is 300mph and the clip is 300km/h
subtitles?!!
really!!! I thought you were going for the 300 mph run
Mat: The fatsest car in the world, Bugatti Chiron SS Koenigsegg: For now
300mph car only shown going 300kmh
Matt is addicted to the adrenaline rush from launching cars 😂
Why is there boxes of old cables in the back?
*Still slower than Stock Supra*
This German driver is boring AF!
It’s a W16 ?????!
Mat's reaction is like a small child getting what he always wanted 😂🥰 so cute haha
So what do we all think the standing quarter of a mile time would be?. ..... My guess 9.0 seconds.....
1:36 W12? i dont think so buddy...
Outrageous clickbait Matt. But... good video.
It's 300kmh not 300mph. Great car and another great video anyhow.
I will buy it 😍
No brake test? 😜
Am i the only one who is gonna ask what was on the back ? It looked like a box with wires tossed together.
I thought mat will put a stick in the tail pipe 🤣
Stick of truth... you should have done the stick of truth. 🤣🤣🤣
KMH...KMH
When I get one I'll let you guys know and let you drive mine.
The accelaration from100km/h to 200km/h is incredible
Mat at 6:02...lollest
I’m curious what  Bugatti make next
Am I the only one here getting annoyed by the Porsche ad😑
The driver makes the stig seem chatty😀
1:34.... I see Alfa Romeo Brera headlights
Buying this Car isn't the problem, getting the road to drive is the problem
Bro u don’t need to wear a mask in a car
I was expecting you to poke a 3 million pound Bugatti with a stick in front of them 😂
1:34 8L W12? Wasn't it a W16?
Im the first to go IN the 300MPH Bugatti. Not the First to GO 300MPH in the 300MPH Bugatti :D
I was so disappointed when the doors opend like a regular car I feel like u should get transported into the drivers seat
remove the “in the” from the title and this would be a much more exciting video
Will you poke it with the stick of truth
1:35 8l W12? Isn‘t it a W16?
Why are they wearing masks
This engineer sounds very German. :D
So? How much can I save for this car if I use carwow?
A major bucket list item for any car enthusiast.
P1 vs Senna vs 720s
Km/h
'This is bugatt?' *YES* 'It has four wheeles?' *YES* 'This is fast yeah?' *YES* *YES* YES YES Yes yes  Thats all i hear from the Bugatti engineer
"But vee havz already been at 300... 2 times"  Woosh!
Caption says 300mph. Speedo shows km/h. Did i miss something or are they only doing about 186mph🤷🏻‍♂️
So now you are able to see what Adrenaline does with your nervous system.
The most powerful car I ever been in was a Nissan GTR R35
At first I thought those wires on the engine bay are two pots of plants lmao
So he himself didn’t go 300MPH  just 300km   Title is misleading. Clickbait !!!!!!!!!!!
What a car  🤯🔥
Why is everything black but the wheels
Yanny is jealous
I think you've been testing electric cars too much lately Mat, it's a W16 not a W12😂
Anyone else notice he said W12? Sir, that’s a W16 🤣
I wonder on how many times it took to refuel at full tank on this car.
I want to see how much i can save on this car
Wow, carwow really made it. Well done Matt 👏🏽
First to go 300mph? Hmmmmmm
Mat has climaxed
It was kph not mph @carwow
Amazing car, but very unattractive colour.
Does carwow have any good deals on a new Bugatti?
But how much can you get it for on carwow?
I have been waiting for this video.
Never seen Matt so excited like that before! Though, being in Bugatti and be it a Chiron, it’s SOMETHING unique!
"want to see how much you can save on a new car?"  _shows a Bugatti Chiron Supersport_  Hell yeah.. I wanna see how much I can save on that please
The joy on his face was something else
At least you got to test it out and not Super car blonde. Not to throw shade, but I don't think she would have did the speed test
I thought it has W16 not W12. Well that what is says on the Bugatti web. 303 km/h not mph :) is a big difference. As 300mph is nealry 500kmh hahahah.
Not 300 MPH, but 300 km/h....
Matt was genuinely excited for this ride
1:36 W12 or W16?
Matt: 3 2 1 G- YouTube: "Join Audible and have a free audiobook on us."
Try koenigsegg jesko
What's 0-60 though? And it did the 1/4th mile in....... 🤔
Title should say 300 kmph not mph
Wrong title: they only went up to 300kph because the car still in in it's testing phase.
Overrated AF
188mph and only 2/3 of top speed shows how much technology has advanced in the last two decades.
How much can I save on one through an offer from Carwow?
Was that house plants sitting up on the back 🤔
isn't 300 km/h only 186 mph?
Well, I just removed the center caps from my car. This is what I have learnt from this video to aid in my top end. Thank you
Correction on the title it's not mph but km/h. 😊Also top speed I think is 300mph as mentioned earlier
300 km/hr Watson! And u ain't the first
300kmh not mph, that being said, still an amazing ride. Chris you are living the dream!!
0:14 the window falls on the door.  I am impressed with the quality
I wonder if it was going so fast it lost 4 cylinders somewhere
Car10 of 10.                  Sound0 of 10
It’s a W16 mate
And now try Jesko
Driver was a true German engineer. Just straight blunt answers, no sense of humor
Common Matthew....it is 300 kmph and not 300 mph....in the video title u have mentioned it wrong Mat...
Don't misunderstand the title. They went only 300 km/h not it's full capacity, it has a limiter.
no stick of truth:( thats what we all wanted to see if they real
Looking forward to a drag race in this against Yanni!
W16*
Okay throughout the entire video there are like 4 Porche ads.   Especially one when he said 3..2..1..
It's a W16 not W12
Nice Volkswagen mate !
ZU WILD
tesla roadster wiill be better
2L engine, loved the Koenigsegg reference
But only 2 seaters🤨
How much does Carwow save me if i order this vehicle via carwow? Can i trade in my honda civic hybrid??
What on earth are those two boxes of spaghetti wiring behind you both?!
Ahh Mat your lying :-: the fastest car you’ve been in besides this car is not a Tesla Model S Performance (The Cheetah Stace is faster but not the fastest) The fastest car you’ve been in besides the Chiron is The new Porsche 911 Turbo
so how much can I save on it through the carwow app?
I wonder how quick it is on the quarter mile, it would have been cool to see the times
The first journalist in that car...  Oooof, not even Top Gear...
I am Gay
how much can I save on a new Bugatti Chiron SS 300+ with Carwow?
To see the joy in his face... :-)
What an idiot 🥺
Finally
Fair play to matt and the team. Amazing content!
300 kph ≠ 300mph
Mat gets invited by Bugatti to try a Bugatti and still get the engine wrong
Looks like some one tried to build a homemade bugatti
W12 ?
So when you guys are done testing that car. Is it up for grabs.?I mean if ur just gonna discard it😂
Mat!!!!!! How r u doin  Wowwwwwww  Bugatti chiron super sport 300+ 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Hey man  You r awesome man You're review is the best mat I'm a big fan to u  I'm from TAMIL NADU,  INDIA you rock man
If I was never make the cut at Bugatti bc everyday id take Chirons out for “testing” no results no notes nothing just driving 20 hours a day endurance testing 😂
What fools disliked this???
300kmh
he forgot the supra he reviewed which also had crazy pulling power
When are you gonna drag race it?
*Chiron*     _vs_     *Jesko*     _vs_     *AMG - ONE*
Isn't 300mph - that was a prototype.
And how many I can save on my Bugatti huh?
km/h not mph
Want to see how much you can save on a new Bugatti? Just click on the right corner of the screen 😂
matt looks so happy LOLOL
nobody:  the driver: of course
First person? So before Shmee then?
1:34 *its a w16 not w12
That engineer guy is programmed to say *yes
Wait, You did not check if the exhausts are fake!
🤭 6:05 Matts counting in his head then looks over to see 0-100kph time.. by that time it's well over 250 kph
Mat: It's the fastest production car ever made! Koenigsegg: Are we a joke to you? Pass by our office when you have time.
Mat drove hundreds of vehicles but we never saw him laugh like that ! Bugatti can make you laugh unusually.
🔥🔥🔥
it was 300kmph not 300 mph joker
Mat you have to review a rolls Royce dawn and ghost . We are waiting for those videos And some videos of pagani's and buggati's also . Please mat full fill our wish .
2020 Batmobile
Mat: 3 2 1 ...  add: say no more 🤦‍♂️😂😂
Even Buggati knows that Mat is the best car reviewer.
Did he just say W12 🥴 1:35
1:35 8.0 W12? W16 for sure.
Anyone who got an ad at 3 2 1 go!?
Did I miss the part where he did 300 MPH or is this still a clown ass channel
1:35 W12... hahahaha
Manny Khoshbin's next video -  HELP ME SPEC OUT MY NEW BUGATTI CHIRON SUPER SPORT!
Theres only 30? Isn't the jesko gonna have around 130 made?
Car can do 300 mph but they were pulling 186 mph.. yes?
0:56, 1:17 and 2:01 I'm missing the stick of truth at these time points of the video. What's this Matt where is the stick of truth
Me going 120 mph is insane already. Them going 300 wtf!
In the title it says 300mph and he went 300kmh
Congrats and love you mat!❤
Is there any deferance between 300mph and 300kmph?
Could the chiron flip over a smart when driving 300 mph?
The engineer must be thinking.....Can we finish these boring reviews quickly. I’m gonna back to build my 400m/h car
Damn this car is beautiful 😍
How much can carwow save me on a Chiron 300?
Never seen Mat so excited :)
Next go drive Koenigsegg
3....2....1.... advertisement 🤦🏻‍♂️
17 sec 0-300 km/h
Send me some money to buy this beast  I just love it❤️
This will become the most watched video for Mat!
beem waiting to hear..."here's 5 annoying things about this car 😁 also really wanted to see some skids in a chiron c'mon mat what gives???
Never seen Matt this happy
W16*
WHERE IS THE STICK OF TRUTH BOIIII? :)
The fastest car in the world is the koeningsegg one
Interestingly Speedo reads in Km/h... hmm 🤔
*kph, not mph. Good job on your bullshit title.
4:59 no you haven't Matt :) its obviously porsche 911 turbo s with 10.1 man, how can u forget that :D
Lol.. 300 kmph rather than 300mph Please don't spread lies
1:35 *W16* 😂
We have to agree, Mat's hardwork paid off. He is the 1st one to get hands on 300+ Chiron. Period. Hatsoff to you Sir.
At 300 this car was quite silent inside and that is before they put the "normal" insulation package...Not to mention the total lack of vibration. The track is super smooth for sure but still...For 3,5 millions euros one might expect all of this anyway i guess.
If you can, skip the Bugatti, buy a koenigsegg which is faster and cheaper. Job done
Lol Mat forgot about the New Porsche 911 Turbo S  😂😂
*the digital speedo doesn’t display the real numbers fast enough of course*     btw i’m also a koenigsegg fan.
If you can, skip the Bugatti, buy a koenigsegg which is faster and cheaper. Job done
Mat that's not 300mph,That's 300kmh
It is a W16, 8 litre not a W12 as Matt said, isn't it?
Am I missing something here. The odometer shows 300 km/h which translates to 186 mph then why it is mentioned 300mph in video description. Nevertheless nice video with beautiful car. Thanks for that.
1:35 w16 not w12
Clickbait :/
The Porsche ads keep ruining your video reviews.
Happy to see my mans Matt getting invited to exclusive events like this. From a journalist reviewing humble, everyday cars a decade ago to this.
How much can I save on this car please, carwow would you be that kind and do me an offer?
300kmh is nuts! My personal record is 327kmh, after 300kmh it feels like you are driving in an another  dimension.
Chiron Super Sport was thrilling just to watch!
1:35 W12?😂😂😂
when will yoy test the top speed?  i want to see that also!!
Love matttt
It's not the FASTEST, they still need to test fully stock unmodified version of it
300km not 300mp
The whole car looks mean, but the rear is seeerious holy shit!
dats 300kmh thoooo not mph, wait till christians jesko is done it'll destroy this Vdub
Does he go 300miles? I see he went up 300km which is 187 miles...
9:06 Mat is sweating 😅🥵
the most expensive carwow stick of truth - this one here!!
Thank fully you listen to me Matt .. and appreciated that you guys read the comments and try to fulfill it ❤️
Ahhhh everywhere says km/h soo...? I did skip to driving,did I miss something?
how much we save from carwow, otherwise i wont buy it
You get opportunity to drive in Chiron and they dont drive you faster than 300kmh... shame... And Mat you were driving porsche 911 turbo s wich covers 400m in 10.1 sec
Alsace en force 🔴⚪️
Bugatti employees are no fun.
Did anyone notice that the cables in the back kinda look like two potted plants?
9:27   Until the Jesko comes along anyway.
Conigswhat?
Congrats matt!!
I'm sorry, did he say "8-liter W TWELVE? *vomits in throat* it is SIXTEEN, Mat.  Edit: watched the whole video now. he did not even go 300 MPH, he went 300 KM/H.  he done clickbaited us.
Amazing car isn't - the engineer sounds quite german - so cool and dry, Matt losing its mind
The title says he went 300 mph, but he only went 300 kmh.  I'm confused.
I've never been happier for someone else really... But I'm so glad that Matt got to ride in this car.. It felt like as if a family member just hit the jackpot.. Keep it going Matt.. Hope that you'll get to drive one and own it one day
Cannot even hit 200mph with the limiter?
The engineer seems to be German hehe
300KM or 300MPH ???  186.41 MPH, will the full production do 300MPH at 483 KPH?  you were like a kid with a new toy
I do like that w12
Why do people make fun of the engineer? He seems like a really nice guy and clearly English isn't his first language
😷😷👍👍
"Want to see how much you can save on a new Bugatti? Click on the deals box to the right"
Even the engineer couldn't resist Matt's sheer enthusiasm. Legendary blagging by Matt to get this ride.
In terms of aesthetically, this is the only Bugatti that is WOW looking in my opinion. geeeez 😍
KPH or MPH?
and when Matt begin the countdown i saw Porsche video😁😂🤣
best carwow video ever
6:45 that was the best "Yes"
lucky you
Ok so no one heard him call it a W-12?
Didn't actually go 300mph though, 300kph. Re-title your video! D:
Along comes the Koenigsegg Regera and makes the Buggati look like it's parked when accelerating from 0 to 400km/h.
Isnt it a W16?
He could've ended with, 'Want to know how much you can save on a Bugatti Chiron Supersport?  Click the link in the description!'
how fast 1/4 ?
🇨🇵❤️🇩🇪
Not a fan of the wing mirrors, may cancel my order....
Editor needs to fix the title. They went 300 kph not mph
I thought it was a W16?
Al fin
Woww great👌🏻👌🏻#techltitude
This car gets faster to 200kph than my car gets to 100kph😂
Wenn dein Tacho bis 500 geht
I have A dream can u fulfill for only one year
W16*
Matt...how much can we save on this Bugatti on Carwow ..😂
Three two one go Ads .
The car has a W16
So how much can I save on it through carwow?
8.0 W12? Not sure about that one
300km/h is cool but Matt is acting like they were going 300m/h in his first reaction haha
Now try the Jesko!!
1:35 i dont think thats  a w12
Fast and furious 😂
Did he say w12?
The driver is German ofc 😂
Engineer has one too many Chad memes lol  y e s.
mps
That looks like that bat mobile
Am I the only one disappointed they didnt do 300mph?
Great video and congrats on being the first one Mat, well deserved
Damn, that 100-200 KMh speedometer movement is insane. Its like it isnt even trying.
happy for u man!
300 is “ NORMAL “
Unofficial record
How much off on carwow matt?
Me: WTF he be quick Mat at 300kph: it doesn’t feel that fast really
What I would like to know is can we get a good deal on one with Carwow?
How about 400？
My heart was beating almost as Mat's during acceleration
matt gets the job done!
Ok This is hilarious. I want to know what you guys are thinking when you wear a mask in the car lol. Absolute crazy how brainwashed people are.   Do you think if you wear a mask in the car, u won’t get covid? As if covid just floats around in the car lol o lord.
French car
Congratulations mat!
300Kmh is not 300mph please correct!!
Um, I've only seen 300 KM/H for 180 MPH?  Why does the title say 300 MPH?
Who else laughed when Mat was laughing...contagious.
Just checked CarWow and no discount to be had on this...well pissed off.
It would go even faster without the two spider plants on the rear deck 😂
Why is he so dirty??😂
Does Bruce Wayne know you borrowed his ride? Looks epic!
Mat, the fastest car from 0-60 that you have been is the NEW PORSCHE 911 TURBO S, 10.2 seconds 1/4 mile, dont you remeber?
Nice video bro 😍🔥👌😍🙌 #mechfix https://youtu.be/48AL7zewzHI
Everyone talking about the driver not being very talkative...you kind of have to concentrate doing 180+ mph...
Overpriced eye sore
Phrase male a video on Ford gt
Clickbait...you went 300KMPH...NOT 300MPH
Uglyest car ever
its Kmph
Wow
What 300 mph? Must be kph 😒😒
yeah but it's 300kmh not mph
You can either be crazy smart, or you can hold a conversation. You can't have both.
1:35 its a w16 not a w12😂🤦🏻‍♂️
At 1:36 did he say 8L W12
Great review  I am a great fan of yours
How much can I save on Bugatti Chiron through Carwow? 😂
3:33 Straight in at the deep end, that's me. - Mat Watson 2020
Wait until Roadster 2.0
Is that Bottas driving?
what a bloody beast!! and soon more beasts comes for this madness.. AMG one,Koenigsegg jesko,Sp chaos.
This title is clickbait. Matt is not the first person to drive this Bugatti. The man who went 300mph+ was.
i was expecting a video of a honda civic not this
Matt , Please put subtitles or captions while speaking.I and someone who can’t understand your English it will help us more for understanding.
5:15 Matt's maniac laugh it's so epic,  even Joaquin Phoenix Joker would stay speechless.
u wrote 300mph in title but u only go 300kph
How about Koenigseeg, Mat? Dont you wanna review it?
185 mph in a blink!
U r wrong Bro. Koenigsegg is fastesr
Mat your lucky 🤪
BTW, ITS W16 NOT W 12
Isn't it a w16 ? Not w12
change title to kmh
Matt looking like a 8 year old with excitement.
from 100  to 300 km/h amazing acceleration but form 0-100 i"m not impressed
They copied the mercedez stuffs !!!
can we just take a moment to matt thinking it has a w12 instead of w16
As far as I can see there is a lot of Turbo Lag, probably because he didn't use Launch Control. But HOT DAMN it's fast after the first second of acceleration!
Are you wearing a mask in the car because one of you are infected with the Virus???
well mat its w16 not w12
Come on guys.. this dude is Joe Achilles undercover "😏👈"
What a happy boy @Mat Watson 😂😂😂😂💥💥💥💥
Thanks God he didn't compare it with Porsche or BMW. 😂😂✌
You lucky b@%&#£d!!!
1:36 he said it's a W12, imma die 😭 HOW DARE HE ?!
I always wonder .. what car does an engineer of a super car drive in private 🤔
@carwow  😂 🤣😵🥴🤒😰😨😱🤢🤮🤕😷 Bahahaha title says 300mph, then reality kicks ins and it’s actually 300kpm. What a fail or clever title bait.   AND   1:35 - 8 liter w12 huh? Where did the last 4 cylinder go? Did it lose one turbo too? Lol
Thank god its not supercar blonde
Rare and one off Ferraris  https://youtu.be/QyxERb96UKA
That is a w16
Driver is a savage 😳
Matt you should try the koenigsegg any of the koenigseggs your mind will be blown! 💥
I like how the engineers are watching him at the back
Really, Matt?
Mat is like a kid in a candy store😂😂😂
😍🚗🔥
Thought Matt got the BIG BOY
Next epic vid 📸🔥
Bugatti: Accelerates Matt: HAGHAHAHAGAHAGAGAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAGAHAHSHITHAGAGSGHA
NOT 300mph but 300 kmh! THIS IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE. Clickbait in his final form!
300mph? didnt u mean 300km/h?
you know it is a test car when there is a ton of cabling above the engine instead of an engine cover
It wasn’t 300 mph only 300 kmh
Matt: 3 2 1 go YouTube algorithm: 3 2 1 ad Me: I'm sick of this.
Review the new guilia quadrifolio
Just a quick question why can't speedometers go up unit by unit why do they always jump numbers?
I swear, I have never enjoyed a clickbait video more in my life 😂
This engineer have the same software that HALAAND from BVB have.
I thoroughly enjoyed that uncontrollable laughter at 5:12
Matt just wanna go 300
That was poor no big bottle test

Where is the discount on chiron Matt?
Who dislikes these videos?? 🙄How boring is your life. 🤣🤣🤣
3-2-1 Matt even from the passenger seat!
He sounds german
Ahhh🥺 he forgot to say “hey guys am Matt Watson”😢😢😢 hope u see this...
“Yes.”
They they always say to bugatti "Fastest car in the world"... Always. And always  Koenigsegg have faster car than bugatti. Does they  get to test drive it only if it says so? or what is the thing.. 😅
you arent the first. matthias malmedie drove it before
Awful color, what the heck is Bugatti thinking...
300 km in 13.27 sc😱 ..thts a super beast😱
300 without helmet 🔥🔥🔥
It should be 300kmph ...not mph
Mat from now on: "I tell you what this car is quite fast but not fast as Bugatti."
No mph that's kph
186mph
But how do you know it's the fastest car What about the koenigsegg jesko and the jesko absolute
Matt should get a ride in the Koenigsegg jesko absolut and should do a review about it.
I would love to see MAT launch the chiron
Matt :-  1:35  8 liter W12 in the Chiron Me:-WTF just happened  F*** you corona What happened to the W 16?
*km/h!!!!!
The sound of an old volvo 5cyl is better... sorry 😅
Matt don't forget to test the air vents with your little stick....
It's like I can't smash the like button hard enough on this video. Good stuff.
So what exactly happen?
who here is a koenigsegg fanboy
Mat is the best motor journalist in the world  😉
This is what you suspected from real engineer, straightforward
Are those platns in pots behind the rear glass for experimental purposes? 😝
Why are there plants on the rear window? 🤔
Um the 911 turbo s and taycan turbo s both posted faster times than the tesla.  Did elon pay you to say that Matt?
300km/h not 300 mph little mistake
100 km in 3.14 sc😱..thts a beast
Grand tour did this already
My bet is on the new Gordon Murray car
Matt lucky bugger
Can't wait to save 3 thousand pounds on a Bugatti through carwow
Can’t wait to save £3500 on my new Chiron
Am I missing something. 300km a hour isn't 300 mph. Get a grip Matt.
14s - to 300km/h
300 Km/h
No offer for discounts through the app..?
The change of exhaust tip actually serve a purpose. Their goal is to push the air further away possible from the back of the car so as to not interfere with the air flow created by the car. This way the car is more stable at high speed.
There couldn't be a more German conversation. Short, concise, and Facts only.
it's 300kmh not mph.
100 km in 3.14 sc😱..thts a beast
Matt:“ There’s only 30 in the world” Me: they might have sold like 2 already Also Matt: “their already sold out” Also me: 👁👃👁
The title says 300mph, however he went 302kph (187.654 mph). 🧐
3,2,1 go!... Porsche ad starts
Matt: So if we do 300 kmph and increase the g-force by 2.176 times and downshift at the 6th gear and increase the downforce by 8.17% will the rotation of the Sun change by 2.371%? . . . The engineer: Yes.
You are so lucky being able to have a go in one of those cars.
What‘s the time of 0-300km/h?
NOBODY builds Cars like GERMANS!!
W16?
You said w12
He literally said w12 😤😤😤😤
I can't believe no body noticed  They did 300 Kmph and not 300Mph. Come on carwow!!
3..2..1.. Go  ....... YouTube ad.😒
I thought he was drifting it in that thumbnail😂😂
Epic. Well done mate.  Wish to watch the same over 400km/h one day.
One day I'll own one of these.
W12 or W16?
I’ll rather buy Suzuki Alto instead of this. 😏 Wait! I can only buy Suzuki Alto 😔
The engineer isn’t a many of many words
And if you’re looking to buy a new Chiron, you can save up to £3000 if you shop on carwow
You know what else is the fastest thing In the world?          My reaction when I saw this video in my notifications
Find out how much you can save on a Bugatti.
W12? Isn't it a W16 Quad Turbo 8 Lt.?
Well, the driver, top notch.  300 mph should’ve been kmph?  Doesn’t matter. I’m assuming it was a typo.
I was laughing as hard as Mat did that first run. Man how fast can you get from 0-300kph 😅
Driver sound like Herr Flick from Allo Allo😄😄 seems like a cool guy
Hmm this looks a lot like the 300mph+ car on top gear
I reckon the fastest 0-60 he ever tested was in 10.2 seconds in a Porsche 911 R
1:34 you mean W16 ?
Matt: First
The speedometer going from 100 to 200 to 300 ridiculously fast. Me :- 👁️👄👁️. Honestly atleast once in my life I want to drive or be driven in a Bugatti or a Koenigsegg to 320 or 480 KPH.
6:50 can u count Matt , ♿️
That's epic but surely real experience is inside the car
Why would 529 not like this 🤔
How much can I save through carwow?😅
But i dont understand one thing its in km/h in the speedometer but the title is in mp/h  does this make anysense
Thumbnail was kinda clickbait but it was fun
Use the like button as jelous😂  With my videos hopefully one day you can buy one
It took 4 seconds to 100km/h I used stop watch
Wait, he's going 300kph in the video not mph. 300mph would be 480kph. The title is wrong, I wonder why they didn't went faster, the car is capable of 480+kph.
Very impressive...but it is 300 KM/H  Not 300 MPH !!!
It is amazing how even 20 years of experience cannot make you ignorent on such an event! Ah Mat? I wish I could experience this car myself!! Keep the enjoyment and share it with us!!!
Didn't knew it came with potted plants for the back
No stick of truth or pop up banner for deals on new Verons? 🤣🤣🤣
Why does matt sound weird??
So the eyelashes on fiat 500s is for aero dynamics
I like how the prototype version has the $65,000 sky view option but many customer Chirons don’t
300KPH not 300MPH
your video is astonishing, i really like it. It's 300 "KPH" right?
That drone 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cuando 300mph? 300km también mi  corta césped 🙄🙄🙄
I've been dreaming for years of moving at 300kph in a car and this guy just did it in 10 secs.... life is not fair lol
To be honest... I'm jealous you are working. And I'm sitting home and doing nothing. Maybe one day someone might give a lift on a Buggati
All nice and good ,but why clickbait? Is 300KPH not 300MPH.
He’s the most German man on Earth
there is a difference between 300 mph and 300 km/h. Clickbait
The Bugatti engineer is so German haha
Mat's laugh at 300 kmph reminded me of Brad Pitt's laugh when he's getting beat up in that one scene in Fight Club 😂
Who’s here before 1 mil views
The title says mph but its kph
Well a Koenigsegg would smash that OWL looking vehicle lol
300 kmh, not 300mph
Mat, you didn't go at 300mph, the car is in km/h
At 1:34 he said w12 i thought it was w16
Good things happens to good people....
You mean 300kph??
Sorry to hear you had to work on a weekend...
The high speed loop is gold!!!! Mat absolutely lost it there man!!! This car is bonkers!!! #Chiron #OnThrottle  "Let's do it again, just do it one more time will you?!"
At the end of the day, doesn't matter how much it costs or the top speed is... Only if it makes you feel like a kid when you drive it does
My c6 z06 can  running over 300 kph
Shiiiiit,I counted 0-186mph in like 15 seconds ,what a rush 😊👍
Fastest gas car ever: - It feels just like the 7 seater electric Tesla sedan... Nuff said
It’s a bird, it’s a plane? yes it’s a plane
Imagine having your 300 mph Bugatti limited to only 275 mph. What a first world problem. I feel so sorry for the owners😢
Come on Koenigsegg what are you doing 😔
christian von koenigsegg (calling matt) : nanananananananana the original  matt : yesss
If i was on Matt's place probably i would have had a smiling crisis too :D
I like the pot plants in the engine bay
Jesko Absolut 🆚 Chiron Drag Race
Did he said W12 instead of W16
You should buy a chiron ss and grant people rides
Can I buy it on car wow and get some % off ?
Claim your here before 1 million views ticket here
How much discount is carwow gonna give for this car?
You just laught, it is so fanny. So so so fast car😆
Just some numbers stolen from the video (NOT at all accurate).  100 km/t (63 mph) 3,4 sec 150 km/t (94 mph) 5,9 sec 200 km/t (125 mph) 6,9 sec 250 km/t (156 mph) 10 sec 300 km/t (188 mph) 16,4 sec  1. gear 0 km/t (0 mph) 2. gear 96 km/t (60 mph) 3. gear 150 km/t (94 mph) 4. gear 206 km/t (129 mph) 5. gear 280 km/t (175 mph) 6. gear 298 km/t (186 mph)
Funny his name is Christian 😉
3.....2......1...... Go!!!!!! and right after that an ad plays👏
It's not good video because no speed max limit..! 👎😕
300 mph or 300kmh, I love your videos Btw
But the real question is how much can you save on a new bugatti chiron on carwow
It’s not the fastest car ever.... records are not valid unless you go both ways within 30 minutes. There is another brand that has better accelleration, higher top speed and better brakes. 🤷‍♂️
German engineer, PLEASE take of ur annoying sunglass
Supercar Blondie has LEFT the chat
I’m glad Mat is getting bigger opportunities in the car world
How much can I save on it through carwow
i'm not able to afford this nd my opinion might be irrelevant but testing phase or not bugattis really aren't beautiful cars especially when u look at their price
where is the specialist timing gear? :P
Matts reaction is like a kid getting his favourite hotwheel
How much can I save for this on the carwow app?
Wow i love that Mat is so happy!!!
3 2 1 GO!       Porsche presents...😑
300 km/h man :) not mph!
How much money can I save on a Bugatti Chiron Supersport through carwow?
So theres even a better job than mats?
I can't watch this bs mask shit
you mean w 16 right no buggati in the last few years has w12 from what i know
So how much can I save if I buy this through carwow?
Okay, I'll count us in 3 - 2 - 1 GO!  Get a free audiobook on us.
300 kilometers per hour. No miles per hour
Everyone: Damn... It's time to go to work  Bugatti Test Driver:
Ayy this is my jam!
This sums the hole video  up for Matt  - Might be one of the most expensive car      Matt ever drove  - Also the Bugatti  is also the fastest   VW owned car Matt ever been in and also drove  - And this here is the fastest  Matt ever gone in a straight  line ...
1:37 8.0 w12 does not have an apartment 8.0 w16 ?
One question   Why is there two pot plants behind your heads!?🤔
Just one small point, that was 300kph not mph.
How nice that Bugatti has no digital speedo. 👏🏼
Who was expecting Matt to use the car wow stick to see if the exhausts were real on a 3 million pound chiron
W12?? Isn't it a W16?
You made me sweat man! Wtf..
Pretty hysterical laughter....
You can tell Matt got lost in adrenaline rush when he can't even read maximum BHP correctly. 😂
Matt was not allowed to mention the dual flux capacitor in the back ;)
Bugatti didn't think of trypophobic people like me while designing those wheel arch vents
Imagine on autobahn see that passing you on 300mph
You gotta upgrade your laughter Mat😂😂😂
Yall need to go to Christian Von Koenigsegg and ask him to review the Jesko.
Well not really
So how much can we save on carwow ????
What an opportunity Mat  Just shows you must be doing ok at this old motor journalism malarkey 🤷🏼‍♂️ I’m reckoning it’s the carwow stick of truth that’s giving you the edge!! Congratulations on getting the invite👏🏼
I really think Ma lil engineer is a German Boi
I can't decide who has the best job in the world here... Mat or the test driver
That 500 on the speed gauge looks frightening
Have anybody noticed its actually 300kmph and not 300mph
This 300km not mph
If I'm paying 3 mil for 300 miles an hour, I expect to get 300 miles an hour.
300mph is not the same as 300kmh 🤦
Bugatti Chiron Super Sport HOW MUCH
W 16  not w12
Get your before 250k views here
That Bugatti gets to 300 km/h faster than my car would get to 100 km/h
Its Km/hr and not mph
Wait a minute, is it W12 or W16
Your so rich
Mat :- 3,2,1 ....GO. Porsche ad pops up. Me :- Motherlover....
How much can I save if I buy the Bugatti Chiron 1 of 1 on carwow?
Can't wait for Koenigsegg to smash that top speed record 🚀
Awesome, getting that opportunity goes to show the sleeper success of Carwow, congrats guys!
3 2 1 Go (Ad Pops Up)  Bruh
*so how much can I save when I use carwow?*
Matt: I’m a professional motoring journalist  Uncontrollable laughter: you’re a what?
Un believebl Matt 😮😮 please keep reviewing hyper cars
did you just say w12? 1:34
Yay mask was worn UWU
1:35 W-16 mat
😂😂😂🤪
1:36 says W12. Its a W16 Mat. :);)
1:35 W12? Isn't it a W16?😅😬
Thats crazy how fast this car can do 300km/h
Were was the car wow stick of truth ? Not impressed matt not a full car review unsubbed... 😂😂
F*CKING MASKS !!!!.... THEY DON"T WORK !
Are we just going to ignore the fact that it did 100kph on gear 1 alone
Why does the car look unfinished. Is it a demo car ?
Title kind of sucks - why say 300mph if you’re only going to get 70% of the way there? Disappointing.
Isn't the engine a W16 instead of a W12 like it is stated in the video?
When Matt did that countdown I got a YouTube AD💀
So...on CarWow...what sort of discount can I expect?
what's in the back of the care ... near engine ... looks like salad of wires
W12!!?
When it's 09:05 and you're home but manage to get to your job by 08:55..
Gearbox between the passengers makes me cring a lot
First to go in a 300 mph Bugatti, only goes 300kph/186mph. Clickbait crap. Like a food channel saying 'First to visit the first four Michelin star restaurant in the world ever' - but only had a the breadsticks and a glass of tap water.
You are surgeons both?
I’ve been quicker than this in the M62!
Mmmmmm is it only me or has anyone seen the speedometer shows 300 KILOMETERS PER HOUR not 300 MPH as the title claims. 👹👺👹👹👺👺 shame on you guys.
it's a w16 not w12
I wanna meet the people who dislike like wtf do they feel
did he say w12? isn't it a w16
700 kg engine and gearbox. How did they get the whole car to 2000kg having to transport that lump around? Give me a T50 any day.
Did he say w12?
Mat: this is the FASTEST Car EVER!!  KOENIGSEGG JESKO: Hold my beer
Me sees thumbnail: YES mat finally drives a Bugatti      Aslo me after 0:25     🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Mat - I am the first person to ride in this Bugatti The person who drove this in record breaking run has left his job😂😂😂
So what exactly happened?
„What a way to lose your Bugatti cherry“
nek
That took like 4 seconds from 0 to 100 km/h?..
Fastest car ever still in development?!
How much can I save on the Chiron?
koenigsegg  is better and faster than this
Why are there two pot plants on the parcel shelf
W12??
Isn't it!!
I actually thought that's kmph!! Yeah that is kmph!!
Damn this is fast VW
Doesn't look like it's faster than a p100d 0-100kmh
Она ускоряется до 300 как BMW F90 UKT ))))
The amount of views and comments he got.... Damn🔥
Finally a special Bugatti. Been waiting a while but now i am ready to buy it
Matt so exactly what happen? Bugatti engineer  guy: yes!
The most german german engineer ever
I WANT TO BE MATT WATSON SO BAD
Why didn't you do the carwow stick of truth on those holes in the bonnet
Matt, drove 10000 cars in a drag race, but NEVER a Bugatti, that surprised me
Konisegg is the king...
Boring
this car is basically a vw polo
Respect to you 💯
Great video
Simply bonkers
1:36 Just noticed Matt said that the chiron had a W12 when it actually has a 8 litre quad turbo W16 engine. Not hating on him just a tiny correction. 👍
koenigsegg ✌️
First of all, the current Koenigsegg Agera RS pulls more g force than any Bugatti.  In addition to that, wait for the Koenigsegg Jesko absolut. It's gonna accelerate way faster than this, then the new tesla Roadster with the rocket thruster will take things to the next level.
Man that is a fast car   If only I could afford it😥
Nice flower pots at the back
W12 or w16 sirr??
Next Video Drag Race....
this car is great but i still prefer Matt.  he's so good looking and totally my type.
Nice to now that if you crash at 300mph you got an engineer next to you
Goodness, left me with goosebumps all over my body
If money was no object, I'd still get a 720s or 911🤷🏽‍♂️
Please do a Koenigsegg and bugatti  race and top speed run .....
That monster does 0 to 120 mph faster than my corolla from 0 to 50mph
I’m assuming the spaghetti in the back window is diagnostic and data collection gear. I’d be interested to know what car the engineer drives for his daily...  Bit disappointed you didn’t throw the parcel shelf into a bush...
No launch control? Cheers
Noice
Hey carwow could Mat review an old volvo 850
he definitely had good time
Hmm title says 300 MPH??? Video shows only 300 KPH. Big difference, I was actually disappointed lol
That is 300kph not 300 mph big difference
Bugatti's Speedo climbs as fast as most car's tachometer. :P
I don't watch videos with this damned masks! Sorry! Rocona is a fake!!!
*𝒴𝑒𝓈*
300kph?
more reasons why bugatti is better than koenigsegg, because fucking video proof.
So what exactly happed?
do a chiron vs ariel atom drag race
300 mph or 300 KMPH?  big difference.  it's actually 186 mph.
matt: yes            engineer: yes
Kmh and mph are absolutely interchangeable these days 🤣
Deutsche Ingenieure verstehen kein Spaß wenn es um Autos geht.
How is this not trending....
I have the made in China version. £1k!exact copy
Are those plants in pot on the engine cover? Looks like that to me.
Matt Watson is no longer a Bugatti virgin.
Its 300kmh not mph
Looks like there's plants in the rear window... guess it's a data recorder
nobody on the editing team noticed he said W12? 😂😂
Kinda miss leading, I thought he was gonna go 300 mph not 300 km/h
4:57 Actually according to Wikipedia the list of fastest 0-60mph and the list of fastest 0-100km/h cars is quite a bit different. Both are topped by the 918 Spyder but the Tesla Model S is a fair bit of places lower on 0-100km/h than on 0-60mph.
5:06 but for real tho the turbo lag from 0-50km/h is insane
No stick of truth?  And why are there 2 pot plants in the glass behind them?
I wanted a GR Yaris review but now have to watch this...
I think there is nothing wrong with the driver
Wanna know how much you can save on a buggati?... Click on the carwow....  Lol was looking forward to that
How much will i save buying this on Carwow Matt?
Why again does it say 300 mph instead of 186 mph (300km) ?
Mat u have a vergin Bugatti u so excited 😆
It feels luke that guy wants to kick matt out of the car
This dude driving the worlds fastest car as a part of his job. What a lucky dude
It stand no chance to a Koenigsegg!
this reminds me of when John Connor is asking Arnie what a Terminator is and how it works.
Matt: "Want to know how much you can save on the Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+? Go to our website"  CarWow Website: "nothing to save here, next!"
That driver is the most German human I’ve ever seen.
It is a w 16
nice car, i might buy it idk. How much can i save on a new Bugatti using carwow?
Did somebody confuse mph with kmh?
He said W12. *W12.*
It's 300 kph
Thought you had a couple of plants on the engine cover for a min then
"What a way to lose your Bugatti cherry!!!" 🍒 😭😆🤣
Did you say W12? Is that just a very expensive Bentley for you ? 😮
Speedometer says 300 kilometres per hour, not mph though.
Finally❤️ been waiting for ages
0:55 you're wrong. Those are obviously speed holes.
5:14 matt:laughing like crazy Buggati engineer: doesnt even smile like he is driving a normal car
Imagine having to look out not getting over the Speed Limit on a Race Track... just Bugatti thinks i guess
1:36 W12?!!! MATTHEW THIS IS NOT A BENTLEY!!!! And how do you mistake the engine of the Bugatti?!!!!! This really makes me question your actual knowledge of automotive!!
Bugatti chiron vs a Porsche 911 turbo S drag race would be sick!
Its w16
I'm kinda dissapointed that the video is only 1080P
You didn’t Poke it with the carwow stick of truth. 😂
Matt: *counts down* Ad: im sorry but no
”Yes”
A man of few words
Was it 300 mph or 300 kmh
Doesn't the devel sixteen go like 320+ mph I'm not to sure
300mph or 300kmh...?
It can be a chiron sport because it goes much faster than a original chiron
5:12 That Chiron turns Matt into a laughing kindergarten kid
Matt is like a kid in a candy store for the first time 🤣🤣🤣
As a German I can't quite get that excited about 300km/h but the acceleration is bombastic.
300/1,6=188mph, but still a great video. Congrats Matt!
Mat has found a car to smash Yianny with in a drag race for eternity 🤣
C.R.7?
12 year old Supra fanboys: Tuned Supra can beat that anytime 😂
Imo doesn’t look nearly as appealing as the original
I never saw Matt so happy lmao.
This move that Carwow and Matt just pulled has  completely destroyed all others automobile youtube channels.
I'm disappointed he didn't ask for a brake test...
Petition to make Matt the 4th host of grand tour....I wanna see his interactions with James may
Have you been in Koenigsegg regera 🤔 and experienced it 0-350-0 ? Can you do it for us ?
I beat demon can defeat this chiron on a drag strip
Mat you are very lucky
Why is there 2 plants behind them? Maybe to add green creditals
Mph?
Like he says he is the first to go 300mph but they are going 300kmh not mph ? 😂
I mean that was 300kph not 300mph quite a difference 😂
its a gift and a curse to be in a Bugatti but when u get back in to your regular car you be like 😣 even if you have a fast car lol
you know it's serious shit if matt not even using stick of truth
the engineer sounds like an AI 😂
Matt deserves this 👌🏽👌🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Hear the intro "fastest ever" see hes age... Ok boomer
Matt in the title say 300MPH but is KMH :)
1:36 W12 ? When Matt is so hyped that he ate 4 cyl
1:35  Did he say W12?🤔😳
I bet Yianni is watching this with teary Eyes 😭
W12 really matt ?
Bugatti est la déesse automobile une œuvre d'art 👌😍😍
The engineer speaks like Eric haaland
Life... completed it mate 👍
Bugatti Chirons (doesn‘t matter which of those 1000 variants you choose) are nice and ok fast...until you ride in a Koenigsegg, then they are like a VW Golf
The Bugatti engineer... I'm sure he's the life of every party.
300 km/h not mp/h
CLICK BAITTTTTTT 300mph and 300kmh big difference...
My God, never seen Matt so excited, really looks like a kid, great real emotions, good one
1:37. A W12 huh 😬🤣
Mat ads
300 kph not mph , matt is becoming a clickbaiter haha ,all joke love the video though
#Drag race with Chiron
I am not sure about the Claim i think the koenigseg its faster ,you need to  ask Cristian is opinion .... Lol
I think you said W12 there mate, but this VW had 16 plungers.
Hi matt...i always loved watching your car review in carwow...and speaking about first timers...this is your first time in a Bugatti...now i wanna see you doing a koenigsegg review...i have not seen any review from you in a koenigsegg...or if you have then I'm sorry i have not come across that video...anyway cheers and my best wishes are with you and your team...you guys are doing a great job👍
Is it just me or is the title wrong?? I'm the FIRST to go in the 300mph Bugatti Chiron Super Sport *WORLD EXCLUSIVE* - It says 300mph but he was going 300kmh.
Can I get a Bugatti in car wow..!😄
Matt counts down Meanwhile Ad ruins the fun
Take a shot every time Mat says “isn’t it” or “doesn’t it” 😂 and thank me later
You forgot to poke it with a stick 😅
U idiot, it’s a w16, not w12, and That’s literally written on top of the engine bay
Okay this was the last thing I expected to see on CarWow but I’m glad to see it xD
I thought he was going to go till 300mph
Hey thats 300 kmph not mph
In my opinion the start is so slow, but After 30 km/h it speeds so much
The exhaust helps push the car
Well you've come pretty far from driving the 100k £ cars 😂
100-200 in around 4 seconds. Maybe like 3.9 if it was vboxed. That's the same as a 1000hp klasen Audi R8 V10 plus.
Actually the fastest on the 1/4 mile on CarWow is the Porsche Turbo S (992) in 10.1 , isn’t it?
No stick of truth??
Bugatti Chiron Engineer. Yes. Zero personality: Yes.
Yianne: im out of here
Nobody is going to talk about the mish mash of wires on top of the engines heads?? +
1:37 did anyone notice he said w12 instead of w16.....
Not a fan of the looks...
Jesko absolut is forgotten
05:30 Matt... you clearly haven't been in a 1500bhp GT-R or a 1800bhp Huracan.
Sow i can only go 275 miles an hour on the road, like a peasant if i buy one ? Phu 😠
Mat reminds me of one of my mates, hes a wanker too 😂
1:30, isn't bugatti chiron sports 300 a W16 engine? Why is it w12?
Ya Allah berikan saya kekuatan untuk membeli mobil ini ya Allah
You are so lucky matt
What is your verdict,  should we short list it ..
Daaaaaammmmnnnnnnnn
1:36 it is not a W12, it is a W16
I want to see how much I can save on this on car wow
Looking for "Supra is faster" comments...
Matt : this is the fastest car in the world Koenigsegg : hold my jesko🤣🤣🤣🤣
Its not the fastest tho...
Königsegg has to invite him too
It’s kinda stupid they didn’t let you drive it.
man that looks fun. gis a bell if you need another test pilot...
Does he mean w16 ?
When my Tesla Roadster comes out - it will be the KING.. however this will suffice until then
It is kmph in the video but the title says mph.
Germans short words straight to the point. l’ve been with german construction engineers and that’s how they talk but when they get in to a bar it’s all a different story🙂
The "wiring" on the engine bay look like IEDs or homemade C4.
At last a bugatti 300+ video with no mad koenigsegg fanboys in the comment section
Who cares of speed ..?? The car is matte black that is more than enough...😅😅
Koenigsegg Gemera Make it happen 😎😎🙏🏻🙏🏻
Clickbait. 300kmh is NOT EVEN CLOSE to 300mph.
Where was the stick of truth!
Matt :- 3 2 1 go!!!! Me : it's advertisement
all personality vs zero personality
1:36 Matt its a w16 not a W12
it's better than 300 mph jesko without its proof
@koenigsegg lets make him cry.
I was smiling just by watching this...i cant imagine being in there.
So where's the 300mph like the title says? All I see is 300 kph. You're seriously gonna clickbait your fans like that?
That's amazing car...wooooow!!! Thx a lot!!!
Bear Grylls reviews cars now?
What a machine
The clickbait is strong with this one.
Thanks for the vicarious stupid-crazy high speed drive! By my rough estimates, 0-100: 3.35S ; 0-200: 7.68S ; 0-300: 15.5S  — whew! One kibble though—wasn't it 1616 HP not 616? And not mentioned but I'd expect one more run to 300K and you'd have to have fuel delivered!
Very clever title.
At 1:35 did he say w12??
I want BMW x7 in-depth review
Okay, but why there are Plants in the Back of the Car?
haha  very good!
Title should be 300 kmph instead of 300mph
0-100kph seems to be roughly 3.6 sec (so not quite fast there)...but then it just keeps going at the same rate all the way to 300kph...damn!
WHAT? The Chiron isn't W16 anymore??? They downed it to "only" W12?
Mat enjoying the Bugatti brought a smile to my face.
1:35 ahhhhh yes the infamous quad turbo W12 in the Chiron.
Did he say W12 it’s a W16
Anybody else wondering what the big red button does?
Hey hey! Matt, I didn't expect this from you, how can you say that a new Bugatti has a W12, it does not. It has a quad turbocharged W16 that churns out 1600 HP.😉
Actually according to google the new koenigsegg jesko 2021 model can go 300+ mph so Sweden for the win
KMH not MPH
Now when is koenigsegg going to run the jesko and aboslute so they can beat Bugatti again
Matt, 1:35 It's NOT A W12
This thing is fast ❤
Thats NUTS. I mean NUTS. Its like losing virginity all over again LOL
Title: Going 300 mph Me: Oooo nice Speedometer: see i pulled a sneaky on yah Thomas: *Never seen such bullshit in his life*
He said W12 hahaha
300 km/h is not 300 mph. y'all clickbaited me.
how much can we save on one through carwow???
This is just the best damn video ever.  I’m so happy for you Mat, you deserve it brother!
When at Mat said 3..2..1..go! . YTF did this porche Ad just got launched in front of me I was waitingg for the buggati  launch😤😭
whats so insane or exclusive for you to be in a car first?
The devil siskteen is faster
Chiron looks a lot like the final boss of manga's villain
The man bugatti is the fastes car on the world  Supra: are you shure about this?
400 dislikes from the Segg fanboys.
Where is the stick of truth???? 😂
but how much money can i save on this car using carwow?
You mean W16
What this car proves it that you don't need 10,000nm of wheel torque which people were tricked into thinking the new Tesla roadster has😴
Is it not a W16 not W12?????
Someone get Matt a bugatti to play with, how hard could it be?? 😄
Now that's exclusive content.
3rd gear at 140km/h WTF THIS IS UNREAL
Thank God you didn't say want to see how much you can save in New Bugatti
Do the plants in the back also come included?🤔
you didn't go 300mph, you went 300kmh...bullshit video title tbh
And matt should also try the rimac concept 2...that's one rapid Electric super car!!!!
A true masterpiece... German and French engineering at its best..
Is it just me or the engineer actually sounds like Bottas from Mercedes AMG F1?
But Matt it’s my dream to actually sit in that car and have a ride in it’s top speed
Exactly when he says 3,2,1, GO.    Youtube be like " Let's show him an ad, Lol. "
Still not a koenigsegg ;)
How much discount will I get on carwow?
If I win the lottery I'm 100% buying this car.
IT HAS A W16 NOT A W12
First journalist to go 300mph in a Bugatti but goes 300km/h BRUH
omg
9:34 man thats smooth
1:35 W12 or W16 engine
Thay should hire Gordon marry
300mph reminds me from tv show Hot Wheels Acceleracer
This is the happiest I've seen Matt. Even with that mask on!!!
You lucky bugger. Congrats, and great work as always!
It’s not 300mph Matt it’s actually 300kmph
That feeling when the speedometer is faster than your car tachometer... *sad citycar engine noises*
But its Bugatti Chiron isn't the fastest....its the koenigsegg jesko
Take the damn masks off for God's sake.
Imagine getting paid for testing Bugattis
Koenigsegg Gemera seems way more exciting than this.
Those pipes are like what Ferrari used to do in the '60s. Nothing new here.
Dear Santa.... 😭😭😭
3 2 1 go, boom ads pop up.
Next drag: A45 vs chiron
Its not a test drive. Your on  your way back from the garden centre.  I can see 2 spider plants in the back 😂
At 5:54 who else experienced 3..2..1...      Advertisement😑
Why do they have my grandmas ferns in the back window
He sounds like Nicki Louda
Wow
https://youtu.be/Xeu7U1ePt4E
I would be interested to see a drag race between this Bugatti (I assume it would be Yianni's) and the Tesla Roadster (2020) when they come out. The Tesla Roadster is reported to do the 1/4 mile in under 9 seconds!
Oh sorry.....there was a speed limit in  the race track?....but why put a speed limit on a race track????
Mat : The gearbox is here for the weight distribution isn't?  Bugatti engineering : Sure if you say so.
Uh it’s a w16 Mat, not a w12 🤦🏻‍♂️ 1:35
I think you meant W16 engine with 16 cylinders not 12 like in a plebeian Bentley
I'm feeling there's a race between the chiron vs 992 turbo s
He said w12
Перевиди на русский
It’s just funny watch him explain everything like he is reading straight from the manual.  Word for word.  Just funny he can’t put his own spin on it. Worse the super car blondie.
I thought Matt would do his stick check to check whether the exhausts are real😔😔.
Dude, the fastest car you have been in is 10.2 (911 Turbo S)
where are the 300mph? #nofront
I think Bugatti broke Matt.
No CARWOW discounts on the Bugatti Chiron SS? What a shaaame 😅😅
He said w12 it’s a w16
Was that plants in the back windows?
W16 and not W12
Beauty! A dream car right there.
Jesko is watching closely
Great video, really enjoyed it. Matt was giggling like a child, which is a testament to how amazing this car is considering he drove so many performance cars before! What a car!
3... 2... 1... Go!  Ad > Wait 5 seconds.  🤦🏽‍♂️
The natural reaction of a proper petrolhead - giggling like a little kid.
I wish Mat would be given opportunity to drive it tho, even for few minutes would be wonderful experience in his life. He's very well deserved it :D
Matt… I was expecting 300 MPH
Absolutely crazy how smooth the ride is, even at 186mph. Like, the car wasn't even trying. Bugatti engineering is insane.
1:34 He meant W16
0:47  ah, yes, the *normal* Chiron.
Was expecting a "want to see how much you could save on the new Bughatti Chrion SS"
😂 I love how excited Mat is when the car accelerates... Lovely vid!!
0 out of 10 for the title, you didn't go 300mph, 300km/h yes. However that was awesome anyways
Bro, what was that insane! I can't figure out how fast is that!
1:34 it's a W16 not a W12 Mat!
How much through carwow?
5:29 YOOO NOTICE THE WANG DOING ITS THANG😹
Title: 300mph Video:300kmh
We in germany like the bugatti ss
is that matte black or satin black?
PLOT Twist It Has A Cevic Engine
Great vid, but title deffo sounds like he’ll go 300mph not go IN a car that does 300mph, LOL
Matt is all over the place with enthusiasm and the engineer is on binary mode: 10011010010
W12!? Haha it’s a W16 mate!
review the bugatti
Please put this in a quarter mile vs a 911 turbo s
0:47 you can see the effects of speed just look at all the dirt and dead insects on the bumper 😳
Up to 180+mph like most cars get to 60 haha! Insane car!
No carwow stick of truth? Very disappointed.
Finally 😄👌🏼
Mat's laughter on the acceleration though.....hahahaha
How much can I get off this car?
Mat you forgot to bring the specialist timing gear to see the 0-100kmph and quarter mile time
Wow just wow.. humans have come far in the game of production cars
Darısı @doğankabak in başına
Because MATT is our # 1
I love how childish mat acts with this review. I mean so would anyone 😂😂
Long time" No See"
where is carwow's stick of truth??
Nice car! As a german car enthusiast   I'm amazed by this Bugatti! But I have to say Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut will beat this in any way...😉
Thought these were w16, 8 litre quad turbo but he said w12
Love all your videos bro , much love from jordan 🇯🇴❤️
The Brits seem to turn every statement into a question, don't they?
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
0:56 you didn’t ask for consent😔
Please Mat, bring a Bugatti and drag race with the top 3 fastest drag kings! That would be bang-on!
Wasn't as brutal from 0-60 as I thought(first 30 kmh)
So... Should you... Consider it? Shortlist it or  go right ahead sell a kidney and buy it?!🤣
Mat, where's the Carwow Stick of truth?
1:35, he said W12, not W16
Proud to be French.
Fun fact they didn’t even get over 200 mph today only 188 mph
Just two questions... Mat, where is the stick of truth?   Should we: * avoid * consider * shortlisted or just buy it?
Finally mat thanks for getting the Chiron😂
Kmh, not Mph, Matt.
Matt, how much can we save in Carwow.com?
1:24 did he say w12
That first happy childish reaction... priceless 🤩💪
Was waiting for Matt's "stick of truth" going up the four pipes 🤣
You can save up to 3,000,000£ on a Chiron through the Carwow app 🤣🤣🤣
So how much can you save me on this one
Damn that Bugatti looks Godly
i’m so mad that Matt didn’t tell me how much i can save if i buy one of these trough CarWow!!!😅😅😅
Years ago I hired an F430. Floored it a few times and all I could do was laugh. It's funny that this is the natural reaction. I can't imagine the feeling of a standing start in a Chiron...but we've seen Mat's reaction. Uncontrollable laughter!
Mat: "Let's see what it's like at 300" Christian: we've been there 2 times already
next  300mph+ on  Koenigsegg
Fun fact: the 25% of the downforce was from the car while 75% was created from how heavy this guy balls are
Wow
I wonder when this car have a drag race with Lamborghini Aventador with Yannimize.... I want that reaction, is it gonna happen or it's not a possible thing?
Is that plants on the engine rear windshield?
Everyone's gonna be    deceived  cuz it probably won't reach 300 mph     in the market  selling version
W12? It's downsized?
w12 🤔😂
I only get depressed by the masks and sunglasses.. gee  I hate this time .. horrible  And I hope it was necessary! It looks like the IFR is close to a normal flu ze  If that is the fact I will fucking sue the government
Matt just lost his Bugatti cherry... 😂
What if a bird hits the car
1600hp on the street is cool...   but matt needs to sit in the 2400hp street cars at the texas nights.
Matt, where is the stick?
That feeling of speed that has you just laughing 😂🤣🥳👌💪👍👍👍👍👍👍 I took a Ride before in a Stage 4 Horsepower Freaks E46 M3 Drag Racing Car and we did 0-160mph runs yo test the car, I kept laughing 😂 like Mat.  That feeling is amazing, you are full of adrenaline and it’s a rollercoaster 🎢 ride feeling 🥳😎😜😁👍👍👍👍👍 Bugatti.  My favorite Cars even when I was just a boy 👦 because they are so beautiful, had the EB110 Model Car 🚙 in baby blue, the only one I could afford lol 🤣😂😜👌👍👍👍
Edit title doofus
Wow hard jobs.
the bugatti deserved the carwow stick of truth too.
you went 303 km/h which equals 188.275 mp/h STOP LYING ABOUT YOUR TITLE FOR VIEW...reporting to youtube
Matt: So what's my final verdict on this chiron super sport; should you avoid it, consider it, shortlist it or should you just go ahead and buy it. Well i reckon you should go ahead and buy it
hmmmm it doesnt have wings weird 🤔
Is that a Supra, i dont think so :)
Sooooo not 300mph like the clickbait title?
186mph in nada. Like eh....in seconds niceeeeee
0-200 km/h in 8 seconds that's a true sports car territory, not just a fansy-shamnsy super car, but propper sport, like real racing that's would be cool if people star counting not only 0-100 coz its as we know now 2ez for electric cars, but 0-200 as well this year by the way F1 started showing 0-200 accelerations, 4.3 sec for Ocon was the fastest if I'm not mistaken
3:28 anyone else notices the plants behind the rear window?
Can't wait for the drag race of you in a Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut vs Yanni in a Chiron Super Sport :D
300 kph = 186.411 mph
"Faster car i've ever been on 0-60 and quarter mile is Tesla Model S performance"  2020 Porsche 911 Turbo S: "Am i a joke to you?"
Cheers 🍷
DRAG RACE bugatti against something :DD  Everybody wishes to see that
Drag race against the 911 turbo s
Hey Matt, the Tesla wasn't the fastest cars in your Videos... The Porsche Taycan and new 911 Turbo did better than the Tesla in your Videos 😉
The excitement in his face is what i  need in my life.
Next car review following this?  VW van.
why did you put in the title "300 mph" when you were actually going 300 kmh?
I still think my Aventador is the best value  super car ever on the market. Paid 170k for a 2013 convertible 2nd hand but it still looks better than this 3M 2020 new car. It is about how you open the door.
that engineer's conversation skill is as intresting as a brick
not a w12 but a quad turbo w16
1:32. The engine is 8L W16 engine. Not W12. Matt you been smoking abit🤣
Wheres that 300mph?
Are the plant pots optional?
Can i buy the Bugatti in your site?
And you can save £2000 on Carwow.com!
Its not the fastest car ever though is it... the Jesko absolut is 30mph faster...
Sooo, is the title meant to say 300mph or 180mph? 😂😂
How much can one save on this from carwow ?
The driver isn't wearing seatbelts?
The Prototype hit 300mph.. The production variant can never hit 300mph and thats why they limited its top speed to around 275mph
“W12” oOp
Why 0 to 30 is that slow??
Video title should be Popping of Buggati Cherry😂
Ok ok  If Bugatti can Do 1600Hp from 16 Cylenders  With 4Turbskies ect ..... Why bot Try to Put a V8 with 2400Hp and Half the Weight of the W16
1:35  W16****
Roadship...
W16 not W12
Its driving a fucking car it's not rocket science it doesn't take an engineer to drive. Plus it's over rated buggatis aren't cool anymore.
1;36 '8 liter w12 engine' didn't know they used a different engine :)
Don't forget to go to Carwow.com to save an average on £56000
My cars rpm don't even go as fast as this tachometer
This thing is faster 0-300 than my car is 0-100 😩
1:34 8.0L W16*
Still waiting for the stick of truth on this one
How much can i save on this Bugatti  using carwow?
Phhh... The Driver could speed up more without an   electric restriction !
9:53  Matt:want to see how much you can save on a new CAR??? Me:seriously? 😑
“Oh yeah? This is actually happening” I’m dead that was funny
this car probably does 200-300 kmh faster than my car can do 0-100
Want to see how much you can save on a buggati? Click on...... 😁 exciting feature!
Mat trying to get as many 300's as he can haha
This is insane wow, congrats matt
Bugatti engineers: our customers want the best! This car can go 300mph! Its performance is the best!  Buyers: *car sits in garage for life*
No stick of truth or specialist timing gear?
300km/h  thank you
I'd like to see it races against Koenigsegg  Agera RS or even Jesko absolute.
3 2 1... ad
how do you dislike a video like that.
Bugatti engines don't sound good but wait till the jesko
Next Dragrace: Koenigsegg Agera RS Vs Bugatti Chiron
As long as its one way attemp i dont say its 300+ car but its a really fast car
Title says 300 mph, but the car only reached 300 kph. 300mph is roughly 500kph. That would have been interesting to see ;)
W12?? I didn’t know they decreased engine size?
Got nothing on a supra
funfact: after filming this raw material (about  35 minutes) there was 15% fuel left
Imagine being the Bugatti engineer! I would love the opportunity to be able to work on something this important and exciting! It would be cool to say you are part of the team that took performance to the next level by breaking 300 mph.
Psst* Its not a W12 its an W16 !
Wait hold up... so Bugatti is claiming they are the first to hit 300 in a production car; yet the top speed is limited, they don’t even test it in both directions, they knew Koenigsegg was gonna take 300mph, and that guy who was driving Matt said it’s basically still a development car.... I honestly can’t wait til the Jesko destroys their record, the right way.
“Check out the Carwow app and save up to 200k on a new Chiron or any car for that matter”😂
That was a great one. Keep working hard loll
Title: 300 mph!!! WoWowWwIwo  Reality:300kph
It has 16 cylinders not only 12
To see how much you can save on a Bugatti Chiron Super Sport, click on the box above to find our carwow deals on it.
BMW fanboys will still say an m5 is better 😂🤦🏽‍♂️

Fool
Koenigsegg fans:  But... [insert nonsense and angry responses]
1:36 W12? Chiron is a 8.0 W16 my man
That’s awesome , congrats
1.37 W12 ENGINE?! 🤔🤭🙄
This is amazing.... Woww.... I have no words to express... Yes... As you said... We all should experience this atleast once...
Get over it, Bugatti. Koenigsegg has already done it and keep pushing the envelope. Too late, sorry.
Lol your late and not the first but go off
1:35 Excuse me W12 ?? Really matt
8l w16  Not w12
Now we need a Chiron vs Model S P100D vs Turbo S drag race
15 seconds to 186mph! Wow.
I was thinking about this car that would yoy bring chiron in this show just 3hours ago before the post
Matt: I wanna drive this Chiron. Bugatti: No, go and drive Jimny. 😂
300km/h in just under 16 second... 👌👌
W12 ? 🤔 I'm pretty sure it's a W16 😂😂😂
Batmobile at its finest
whats the best deal on the car wow website?
One day agera rs vs bugatti chiron one day...
Let me call Christian wait a sec ✋
kmh not mph like the title says
2700th
Tonto
300km/h in just under 16 second... 👌👌
Yo
This against Yannimize will be amazing
The fastest car in the world what about the Koenigsegg
Tesla is alot more Brutal...
Stupid Scamdemic
0:10 I had to reply that back twice and put my volume up just to hear that. Whys it so silent 😂😂😂
300 kmph*
Where is the stig of truth ?
Love from #India 🇮🇳
W 16
7:45
1:34 its a W16 not a W12 🤔
Dayumm
Don't ever bring up Tesla again when you in a Bugatti that was a terrible thing to say😂😂😂😂😂
Wow
review the mclaren senna
4:12 the 250kp/h sticker for the winter tires hahahaha
Mat counts 3. 2. 1.   Ad pops up...🤣
Mat was thrilled and excited like a little kid : )
Hi Mat you forgot to use carwow Stick..it's is a fake exhaust hhhhhhhh
Hope Yiannimize  will get one and drag race it with Mat.
Oh snaps it got a w12 (1:34)🤣
I'm waiting for revealing Koenigsegg cars on this channel
mat : that's expensive  few min later : Every one should get this experience once in life .
Koenigsegg rolls in...
Isn’t it a w16?
Title says 300mph when actually it's 300kph.
I can't stop looking at the engineer's bald head i'm sorry
Ah yes the bugatti with a W12
Yes
321 when matt was counting i was excited about another pull to 300 then ad came right after 321😅😅
Even if you gave me 99% of i still wouldnt be able to afford it
That's not world exclusive bro Mathias Malmedie drove one before you i mean was driven in ;)
Hi, i would like to see you and  Gripengirl together describing a car  and talking about it.
haahh finally
W16 Mat, W16!!!
1:35 w12? :)) MAT, PAY ATTENTION
Fake exhausts!  No stick of truth
What a Chiron 😍😍😍😍🔥🔥
OK this is too much *flex* mat. Please.
1:35 “you still have the same 16 liter w12” lol
How can we save from Carwow when we buy a Chiron SS 300+ 🤣
I thought at first that they wont let you drive it and put Yani behind the wheel instead :D
Matt should've told him to go for the fourth time.....
Is Tesla the fastest in acceleration or PORSCHE turbo s ..MAT... ?
Crazy what u can buy if you're rich enough
Nothing  makes me laugh like this other than excessive accelaration as well ahahahahahahaha. Thanks for sharing! You made my day :)
Technically, the fastest car in the "world " is the one and only "Henessy Venom F5"!!!!. Not the Chiron Super Sport. Although the Chiron Super Sport is kinda sick but nothing compard to the Venom F5!!!!!.
I'm sooooo happy for you mat 🤪
W12? Did he mean W16?
That speedometer went like the tachometer in my car.... 😅
Go ahead and just try the koenigsegg jesko...its much faster
Where are those Italian?? It's rare to see them with Bugati.
please put this in the drag race!!!!!please!
are the exhaust real or fake? where is the stick of truth !!
Pay for 300 and u get 275😎
I KNOW HE AINT SAY *W12*
300 kph is about 190 mph, just saying'
So what really happened? Matt: 😬💩
No break test😏😏
WTF...I thought you were supposed to go 300mph(497.45kph)not 300 kmh!!!!
0-100 still cant beat tesla :))
so it's 300km/h, not 300mph big difference
Just mind blowing so jealous 👏👏
Wanker.
Done quite well then haven't you Mat.
Remove these funny masks. They are not for protection, but to keep your mouth shut... slave!
I always wanted to see Matt drive a bugatti 🙌
Engine looks like it has a flux capacitor strapped to it :)
I am not jealous at all!!!!!
I’m the first journalist to take a ride in this, right ?  Yes, that is a fact.
I bet it is a W16 not W12 Matt
But does it have a cupholder?
Is a mat finish as aerodynamic to normal smooth?
1:35 he calls it a W12 it’s a W16, that’s like Bugatti’s party piece, how do you miss that?
I'm getting so bored of the willy waving going on in the motor industry.  In a era where electric cars will do 0-60MPH in just over two seconds and people like Bugatti are chasing ever higher top speed records, I'm happy with my little 1.0ltr Daihatsu that's a hoot to drive, does 63MPG and is really nippy at low speeds.
Still 0-100 in 3 secs ?  😐 whats behind the seats 9:34
somehow get your hands on a rimac next !!! it will be sick drag race
In a few years how fast do you think cars are going to be
Fk this Porche ad. I'm done.
Engineer: *puts foot down * Engine: Lets *GO* Electronics: _Waaait, keep it cool_ *car hits about 30 km/h * Electronics: Now Engine: speedo goes brrrr
What bugatti is doing with 16 cylinders, koenigsegg does it with 8😂😂😂
You only went 180mph😒
How about Rimac Concept One!? I think he is faster. NO?
that engineer is DRY as f*ck..is he aware he in a bugatti chiron ss?
Claim your 500k and a 1 million ticket right here
I wanted to hear, 'now I have some really exciting offer and discount on this car but can't tell you. Head over to the carwow website to check it out'.
Why the hell is he laughing like an annoying little kid? Omg...
4:56 *Porsche: Am I a joke to you?*  (Taycan and 911 Turbo S were faster!)
Mat got someone to trust him with a Bugatti?
Is that valtteri bottas????
How german is that, we can go to 300kmph max..goes to 300kmph. If test fella was from Italy he would of probably said something like. "They said keep it under 300, but they did not say kmph or mph"
Those chrome rims 🤢🤮
Want to see how much you can save on the new Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+...
@1:35 the engine is a 8 Liter W16(!) not W12.
Car says 300km/h but title of this video says 300mph hmmmm 🤔🤔
Can mat waston take this car to drag races
Thank god mat didn't die 😂😂
wait, isnt it a W16?
I never heard Mat laugh like that 😂😂😂
You can tell that car was engineered with one purpose in mind and that purpose was to go fast.
Mat’s face when the man tells him to get off 😂 😂
i thought Mat is gonna drive it. too bad.
Mat how much can I save on a new Bugatti trough carwow?  Thanks mate
Looking forward to a drag race with the Jesko absolut
The enginge is a W16 not a W12
Can't review the fastest car in the world without mentioning Tesla :D remember, they spend $0 on marketing
Uh, bad title writer....300km/h NOT 300 MPH
It's a great archievement for VW group, but for me it's more impressive the Gordon Murray project with the McLaren F1 in 1992, 240mph with a 6.1L and 630hp N/A engine it's not for everyone... Bugatti do 300 mph but have a 8L with 1600hp and 4 turbochargers!
W 12 or W 16 😏
Seriously? carwow needs clickbait now???? Sad world Mat
I’m sorry are those plants in the rear windows???
I think you need to take a ride on kawasaki H2R Matt.🤣👌
It’s a 8.0 Quad Turbo W16 not a W12
This guys makes me cringe my nuts out
👏👏👏
Tesla roadster is faster though
Hi Watson,  Where is your verdict? 😂😂😂😂
I so want his job...
god damn masks
The 0-60 time was about 3-4 seconds in the video, which seems slow.  Go to 05:55 and time it yourself. (Obviously, it's not going to be super accurate to rely on video footage, I still thought it would be faster.)   https://youtu.be/tQ4pZQltoW0?t=354
Mat Watson FTW 💯
Matt’s been lifting UwU
Chiron vs porsche 911 turbo s
Why is the first gear Soo long, the car looks slow from 0-50 kmh
When Matt counted it in an Arby’s ad came up
You are the 2nd luckiest person alive
Why the hell are there 2 plants/trees in the back of the Bugatti!? Every front shof of M and German engineer you see 2 plants in the back of the car...  Also, Matt says tesla model s is the fastest car he did the standard Q mile. Wrong. The porsche 911 turbo it is.
Anyone else predict a new supersport after the 300mph Bugatti video ?
That's called pure driving pleasure....
Eyyy, i thought he was really going 300mph
Did anyone notice there are plants sitting on the engine bay???!!!!!  Edit:- My bad those look like instruments mounted on the engine😅
So happy for Matt.✨🙏🏽
What a way to lose your Bugatti cherry? 😂😂😂😂
The fastest car in the world is the koenigsegg with an average speed of 284.3 miles per hour done in two directions. The maximum speed of the chiron cannot be considered "official" by not doing two directions. It only went one way.
Bugatti Divo: https://youtu.be/Y__XEtjKMyk
he didn't tell us how much we can save on a Chiron on carwow :(
1:35 sorry Mat, but its an 8l W 16 and not W 12 😉
The "300+ Test" was underwhelming....
Zero to Life in prison in under ten seconds.
I thought he was gonna say at the end: Do you want to know how much you can save on a Bugatti?😂
Anyone know what the "sunroof" is made of? Seems somewhat unusual to have that type of roof in a car focused so heavily on speed and weight savings.
beautiful review thanks matt greetings from croatia.
Rear end is so ugly even if i was billionnaire i wouldnt buy it so fucken ugly 😂
Change the title. Km/h isn’t as exciting as mph
So how much discount you can get on a Chiron at CarWow?????????????????????????????????
Title must be changed to 300kmph from 300mph,   Happy to see mats another type of kiddo mind 🤩🤩😍😍😍😍 see how cheeered he is❣️❣️❣️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
BMW fanboys: m3 is faster
Need Drug Race a Porsche 911 s turbo 😄😄
never clicked on a carwow video so fast
1:35 sorry Mat, but its an 8l W 16 and not W 12 😉
Hey sir plz enable English subtitle I am hearing impairment :-((( I love carwow
300mph = 482kmh . .... just putting it there
It's 300km/h not 300mph
Speedo moves as fast as your bank account towards bankruptcy.
Mat is so lucky entering the fastest car in the world! He loves his job! Especially when reviewing sport luxury cars! I hope a great future for this chanell!!!!!! YOU'RE THE BEST, CARWOW! ONWARD AND FORWARD!
The subtitle?
What kind of discount we have on this on Carwow?
300kph not mph
Well it was in km/h instead of mph
Where is the Carwow stick of truth?
So when exactly did you go 300mph?
No wooden stick in the exhaust pipes test?
W16 not w12
W16, not W12 Matt
How much of a discount can I get off the Carwow app for one of these Matt? :D
Jesus Christ this thing is a whale.
0 - 300ks in 15 seconds that's quick
_asks questions with a lot of enthusiasm and interest_  Engineer guy: *y* *e* *s*
There is too much add
“Our conversation does not require this many words.” - Engineer
Looks like they have plants behind them. Nice cozy touch by Bugatti🌱
My RS5 could accelerate quicker
What 0-300 in 13 seconds and the fuel is empty 🧐
Wait for the Jesko, to crush the thrown of Bugatti.!! 😎😎
"if you want one of these its gonna cost you 3.4 million! but don't forget to click the pop-up banner above to see how you can save 3 pounds"
Meanwhile, Koenigsegg is watching and not even taking notes😆
the swooped down rear looks incredible
I bet those exhaust tips are fake :))
I love the sound of Bugatti accelarating.
Want see how much you can save on a new bugatti log on to carwow .com
@carwow How much can I save on a Chiron?
I honestly thought he was about to say " wanna see how much you can save on a new Buggati"
Guess it’s like banging a supermodel and then you’ll never be the same.
Title says 300 mph but car only goes to 300 km/h ...  very disappointing.
Finally
what are those plants?
I love Car Wow but this was Click Bait 300km is only 186mph...looked fun though
The fastest car was Porsche 911 with 10.01 second. Am ı wrong?
My Audi A5 2.0 TDI recommends shifting in 6th gear at 80kmh  The Bugatti is going 182kmh in 3rd.... Wth
He drove a lot of cars but never seen him laughing out this long...even in taycan 😅😅😅
Holy man my smile is all the way to my ears and I’m laughing and I’m sitting in my couch imagine being in one of these
Even with the mask, I could see the giant grin on Mat's face!  What a ride that must've been - I hope he gets another go 'round pushing up towards 480km/h in the finished car.
I wish I can experience that, for once
The luckiest car journalist
That Chiron looks like a "Madmax car" compared to a Jesko ...
Now, ain’t that something!! 😜😳😳
Stupid face masks!
Koenigsegg should contact Matthew now and let him actually drive it.
Oh so you’re telling me that you’re not going to poke it with a stick then Mat ?
click bait 300MPH.. GJ Mat
The dude driving, he's like a robot. Straight and to the point, fullstop.
KPH not MPH
Stunning ❤️
mat loves his job
2:14 I expected the stick test...
the way it pulls is just insane.
koenigsegg is better.
Let's make it happen, drag race Bugatti chiron vs porche 911
Hey Mat, it’s a W16, not a W12, haha.
@2:42 For a moment there I thought there were pot plants by the rear windows 😂
misleading title
Hey Mat, where’s the carwow stick of truth?
How much do I save on Carwow?
Bugatti engineer is German. Ofcourse. Had to be German knowledge and engineering.
Disliking the video because of the 3s countdown to ads, I expected vroom vroom but got 2 ads in a row, just shameful.
Can you stop putting the ads at the “Go!”   Yours sincerely  Annoyed
It's 300kmh not mph, duh
You are insanely lucky, Mat! Can't argue.... but, you totally Deserve it! You are best & passionate genuine car journalist.
Soooo how much money can i save on carwow for a buggati chiron supersport 300 😆
マスクしてる😷
Mat has just got numb for any other car ever. I have never seen him this excited.
1:46 British automotive journalist: So it's a long tail this car :D
Buggati engineer got no chill man...😂
Hey it's go 300 kph not 300 mph brother
Golf boba us faster
#1 Rule of owning a bugatti there will always be a faster Koenigsegg
I don't even waste time anymore, I just click on the video and immediately like it 😂
8:54 "WOAH! THERE'S A DRONE!!"
That’s km/h no miles 😭😭😭🤔🤔
That’s the guy that does the german voice in forza horizon 4😂
Shouldn't the caption be kmph instead of mph?
Mats reactions was just   awesome 😂
Click bait..!! its 300 kph, not 300mph 😒🤒
Didn't even go 200mph. I think you meant 300klm Mat #clickbait
Closes the door so the driver who kicked him out has to do extra work..... cheeky bastard
You are the FIRST one who from a respected car reviewer turned  into a CLOWN !!!
How fast can you go 300 Bugatti: yes
She goes faster 0-300 than me 0-100
Christian now busy typing an email to invite Mat to test Jesko to show him the Absolut power of a "sports" car.
Drag race it with yianni.
Sorry but this intro reminded me so much "Supercarblondie" 😂
This thing is doing 0 - 300 in the time it takes most cars to do 0 - 100😭
Love this video. Great one guys
“Not a production car they said”  They so hurt rn
Looks better than the regular Chiron tbh
how many ads does youtube allow on a 10 min video i get about 4 but only on carwow videos
This review is for 0.000001% people!!!!
YOU WENT 300 KPH NOT MPH AS YOUR CLICK BAIT HEADLINE SAYS ...... 300kph IS 186MPH A BASE CORVETTE CAN DO THAT! LOL. SUPER CILICK BAIT!
I’m pretty sure that Matt fought his way through the line waiting to get into the car 😈😈😈😈
I dare you to test those vents with the stick of truth
Supercar Mattie
Km/h*
We just gonna pretend the koenigsegg regera dosnt exist?
Happy Happy Matt😅
kmh... not mph :/  there was a Bugatti Veyron doing 300+ on Moscow Unlim 8+ years ago
Mathew, you have come a long long long way from reviewing mass-produced cheap cars to this, highly exclusive, perennial of engineering. This is one of the reason why i love this car over koenigseggs or any lightened super-fast car which can achieve same kinda acceleration or speed close to this car. This thing is like a RR when you are on a routine drive. Also during the process of getting to the top speed, it does not shake your teeth loose. It just climbs to the top speed in a calm a composed manner.
Next video 720s vs Bugatti vs 911😂😂😂 finally he got to review a hyper car
300kmh?
Matt is an absolute madman, that crazy laugh of wonder at the speed of the car is just brilliant. Hope you had fun Matt...as if I need to ask!
Mat cried like Henry Ford II did in Ford vs Ferrari after that acceleration run.
Jealous
*Bugatti:* Goes 300mph Mat: This is fast. *ISN'T IT?*
from 0 to 20kph its like are you sure, then it just basically teleports haha
Oh man this guy is lucky
1:35 not w12 it's w16 matttttttt xD
I predict 15 Million views by end of the week 🤯
PLEASE REVIEW A HONDA CRX😭😭😭😭😭
You are great
Bugatti: 0 to 100 real quick Fuel: 100 to 0 real quick
1:36 W16 not W12
If you don't try to get invited to Ehra-Lessien test track to max out the 300+, then you're crazy.
https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/cdc-guidelines-say-wearing-a-mask-during-prolonged-exposure-to-coronavirus-wont-prevent-possible-infection
You deserve this Matt well done carwow, love from Zimbabwe
Alright alright Mat it was good, but the question we all want to know. Was it better than BMW’s idrive? *drumroll*
0:54 "Vents"? I think you'll find those are speed holes
It's 300kmph. Not 300mph
So should we avoid it  Should we consider it  Should we shortlist it  Or should we go right ahead and buy it ?
The title needs to be fixed, you went at 300kmph not 300mph. Feels very click baity
I'm not halfway through and I realize the engineer finds Matt's journalist gestures for illustrative purposes absolutely hilarious.
Wtf, does it have potted plants in the back?
Mat, where is the carwow sticker truth part? 😆
Good for you Matt. I hope you truly enjoyed that rare moment.
This car looks sooo beautiful😍
title have 300 miles not 300 kilometre s
Do you know how much it hurt to see the rims had been scuffed?
Mat forgot his special timing gear
How chuffed he must be
This is the Bugatti CHIRON Super Sport
Amazing carman
Now koenigsegg gonna send you invite to experience their hypercar 😆😆 You just got lucky again
The sexual tension between these two *OMG*
Everybody in their 2L ~150 hp trying to have fun. Matt casually making a reaction to the fastest production car on a Saturday. Amazing reaction thought, nice emotion.
300 km/h........
Nice german accent😂
Mph or kmph??
So bugatti just launched a new car for more than 3.000.000$  Ronaldo: yes.
W16 not w12 mat
Make this a headline story @lifeofpalos 👀
Look at matt enjoying like a kid!
That's so awesome, how did you get to do this.  Happy for you.
Amazing! Your title says "mph" Looks like pure joy.
How much can you save through carwow
Cosy, those two plants in the back.
The engineer sounds like a bundle of laughs 😂
How much saves with *CarWow* on this one ? 😅😅
Try the Rimac Concept 2
Its a w16 Mat
Matt: Oh yeah this is actually happening! (Slams the door on a 3 million dollar car) 😅
I wonder how much I could save on a Bugatti Chiron on carwow...
8:42 Holly fuck that seems so damn effortless
No matter if that are faster cars or not, this bugatti is a very well made car and a mark of what people can do, using the very best materials .. veyron it self was the best for quite some time
Looking forward to the koenigsegg jesko Vs Bugatti Chiron Super Sport drag race on Carwow, I think you're gonna need a longer track 😁
James May would like to have a word with you.
WOWSERS
I'm excepting you can save 99.9% with a Bugatti Chiron on carwow 😂
1:35 Its not a W12. Its a W16...... Really bad mistake
good job matt! very happy and jealous.  the ultimate 2 door super exotic that is daily friendly !
8 L W12? More like W16?
Gf: are you cheating on me?  German engineer: no *yes*
"Want to see how much you can save on a new Bugatti Chiron?"  I don't think so mate, lol
Chiron:300 mph Me: wow
5:12 that petrolhead laugh😂
I did have thought that magnesium wheels are forbbiden at car industry 🤔🤔
That is a German engineer. Cold hearted and to the fucking point always. They are bots not humans.... So cold
I would love to see that ovet 300mph rather than 300km/h. You cheat.
Matt: shits his pants after the first pull up  Also Matt: So what exactly happened???
Laughs in Koenigsegg.
Do a drag between porsche 911 turbo s and Bugatti chiron
Cool 😄😀
Finally Bugatti 😂 Do drag race in this Bugatti please
1:33 umm w16
This is the legendary thing
He looked really excited throughout the video😂
Well that was really not much of a new experience considering they didn't even go as fast as a regular Chiron. Let's see if they ever beat Königsegg lol.
U should change your channel name bcuz that's not a 'Car' it's a fighter jet
I wish I could enjoy working like this...🙄
First time matt has put a mask on lol
I see what you did there with the title. You got me.
Carwow no longer for the people
300kmph not mph
Mat...you lucky pr-ck...race it against  Yianni man...
Great video Matt
The next barrier to be broken is 500kph 😯
3 2 1 GO. Advert 😭😭
technically the guy who drove and dropped it off is the first guy to drive it
Go to koenigegg next mat!
The sound of the engine accelerating.....WOW
Why speedometer soooo laggy?
the time to excelerate to 300 is impressive. Driving 300 that you can do in Golf V 30 edition with revo stage 3. So not that impressive. I want to see it going 400+
is this a german kimi raikonen?
*Matt laughs uncontrollably when it picked up speeeeeeeeeeeeed*  So am I
Mat I think you said W12 instead of W16 when you said the specs of the car.
Major kudos to volkswagen for making the car even though they’re losing money... but that doesnt stop them..
MAT, were you hugely disappointed when you were told you would only be going 300KPH and not the 300MPH that you were told?? Sorry Mat, the Imperial system is not used in the EU, so no MPH for you!!
matt go vroom vroom.  i hope to get a heart ♥️
Slight correction at 1:36 this is a W16 not a W12.
All that road and still driving left
1:36 "It's the same W12" Uhh... Mat it's a W16
but how much can i save on this car if i buy it from carwow?
you are the first 300mph ??? lmfaoo
Remap gives you 1750BHP
I’m so happy Matt got to experience this 😳 one in a lifetime, congratulations. We’re all jealous. 😂
Damn 0-300 is so damn quick! What a car, i wish i can have a ride in it once in my life
i wonder what happends if this guy crashes the bugatti
*****300 KM/H NO MPH SI FUERAN 300MPH SERIAN 480KM/H
When u realize the speedometer goes up to 500 km/h😲😳
Is it w12 or w16?
Is it faster than the new tesla roadster??
Mat acting like a girl with her crush ❤❤❤
It's a W16. A frickin W16. Not a frickin W12.
So then, what's my final verdict? ... "Well, if you can afford it, I reckon you should go right ahead and buy it."
Boy was I waiting for that to happen congrats Mark on your first ever buggati ride hoping to see an drag race between the new agera and the Chiron sport.....and hopefully I review on the agera as well
an 8 liter W12? In an Chiron. That must be new then. :D
Konisegg > bugatti
Why on EARTH DOES IT HAVE HOUSEPLANTS IN IT?!
Mat: This is the fastest car in the world ever. Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut: I'm about to end this car's whole career.
go VW
Im disappointed the CarWow stick of truth wasnt used on those bonnet holes! I mean, we need that proof... 😂😂😂
Still not street legal, you Bugatti fanboys got no competition against Koenigsegg Absolut which is street legal
Bugatti first at carwow channel
Mat Watson bro, you are simply superb...
Isn't it a bugatti chiron pur sport?
W12?! It is a W16!!!
If its out of stock just buy a MIG29 fighter jet
It's actually 300kmph...not 300mph😅
carWOW!!!
Well deserved matwatson👌🏻
300 km/h ..duh. RIP gas
The way the speedo doesn't slow down on it rise, wow.
Why  no Chiron stick of truth...?...:-)
👋🏼 Matt..I too would like to lose my Bugatti cherry 🍒 over and over and over again! Great video. Short and sweet but fun to eat! 😁
This is 300 kmh not mph
So 0-60mph in 3.2 isn’t impressive at all. My GTR will do it in 2.8. However 0-180mph in 15.5 is pretty impressive!
How much money do i save on it with carwow?
Wow that came outta nowhere
Matt fan❤
7:43 some serious vtec
First to stick🤣
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
He said it was a W12, it actually is a W16
Defender vs wrangler
I wonder how much money I can save on a bugatti through carwow...
Going that fast must of been fun Matt Glad you had a great time mate👍
Engineer - how do I find Matt’s mute button...
Defender vs wrangler
Amazing machine, but since there is no production car yet how it can be faster car? I still think that Egg will destroy it like the last time.
Defender vs wrangler
Brilliant video Matt.  Great to see real enthusiasm and excitement just like us normal lads♥️
Click bait did not go to 300mph it went to 300khm! That’s 186 mph
and you did'nt see the brake test from 70mph lol
How much can Carwow save me on this one Mat?
🥚
Defender vs wrangler
Well I’m gonna have some of an awesome time
Mat Watson is the best car  reviewer
I believe this is and will be the best video from carwow unless Matt gets in a jesko
5:11, the moment were Mat becomes Joker 😂
Do a drag race or tug of war between Defender 2020 and wrangler
500km/h on the spedometer 😂
The acceleration is insane
Top fuel does 300+ in under 4 seconds yawn.
First time to find myself in a bugatti not just this bugatti any bugatti 🤔
Im first
Early ish
So how much money do we get off from carwow?
Matt : not this time Supercar Blondie 😉
I wish Koenigsegg had access to this test track. Then this car would probably not be the fastest... The K. Absolut will most likely smoke this.
You know Matt made it when he is the first journalist they let inside the new Super Sport, what a rise right to the top, well done!
where is 300 MPH ????????
1:35 W12?
Mat acting like he has amnesia:asking for another acceleration test🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wait a sec Mat, the Chiron SS has a W16 not a w12
Is he gonna poke it??😅
Big move 🦾
W12? Don’t you mean W16??
Now you should review a normal Bugatti Chiron and compare the two lol
mat wants to drive it  me i cant afford it
I have recently seen a 992 Gt3 Rs near Nardò 😍
The driver: jack ass, can’t you stop talking. I’m trying to drive safely and collect data. I’m working! 😂
Wait until *Jesko Absolut* smashes Bugatti's record!!
7:28 I love this dude ahah
km/h, not mph
SOMEONE GETS PAID TO DRIVE A CHIRON AT 300MPH? I WOULD DO THAT FOR FREE FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE. GOALS!!!!!
Dieser deutsche Akzent ❤️
*Mo vlogs crying* Lmfao
But it's not the fastest car !  Christian Von  thingermygig might refer you to his world record   400 kph on the road in America
Koenigsegg does not like this video.
Wow!!! Just wow!!
1:35 W16*
Matt: ... compared to the normal Chiron...  Me: * still struggling to understand what’s normal about any Chiron
mat sitting in his passenger seat thinking:you can save a total of 300,000 quid if you buy it from carwow,to see how much you can save............ 10 secs later:oh,that just won;t be right will it
.how old are you Matt?
I love it’s eyelashes very clockwork orange
Its not a W12 its W16...!
Lol what the taycan and the 911 turbo. S was faster than the model s...
Wasn't the 911. 2 turbo faster in the quarter mile? VS the tesla.
1:34 8.0L W12? Didn't know bugatti cut 4 cyilinders off of their new SS 🤣😂
I've been waiting for you guys to do a review of a Bugatti for the past 3 years.  Thank you for making this happen Carwow team.
Poli
Top speed model
04:56 and now it is Porsche Taycan 10.3sec.
Isn’t it
Way to twist the words in the title so it seems like you go 300mph to clickbait without actually saying you will go 300... 🙄🤦‍♂️
Nopp Jesko Absolut is faster
This guy is getter then the new top gear ⚙️
It’s a w16 not 12 dude
Great job Matt Watson you first drive Bugatti 300+ super sport Chiron that is is cool  👍👍👍👍👍👍😎😎😎😎🏎🏎🏎🏁🏁🏁🚀🚀🚀
Why are there plants in the back window though? lol
Its not the fastest is the koenigsegg jesko
Imaging your job being testing a buggati, just wow
CHECKMATE Doug DeMuro
Why on gods earth would they give that to you when you can only drive in a straight line the mind boggles
Disappointed bcoz he did not tell me how much I can save on a new Buggati
6:00 doing 100 km/h on 1st gear. Ok 👍🏿
I was all excited for Mat but then that escalated quickly!
Title says 300 mph, but they went only 300 kph
Are the cupholders big enough to fit a 2L bottle though?
I bet Carwow won't be knocking any money off this
This guy at 300km/h : "Extra cool answering matt's questions" Me at 100km/h :  IM GOING TO DIE
5:13  Joker laughter
Yeah I’d use carwow to buy a 3 million dollar car :0
@07:33 Matt: Can I see what it's like at 300? Engineer: We've been at 300 Two times already!!
Actually this is the first car to complete 400km an hour
Well, technically it wasn't clickbait
I will become billionaire in future.
I'm not sure if I'm happy for Matt or jealous of him, this is still pretty cool though and that's an understatement.
Its 300kmh..
"Every other car are gonna be slow , it's a downpoint" Laughs in Jesko Absolut , Venom F5
And it still has normal doors🤦🏼‍♂️
The vents are to let heat out (not pressurized air), you luddite.
Lmao the enginneer is a robot Answers : yes /no
That test driver has the best job in the world.
1:34 you are missing 4 cylinders mate
Wow this is so convenient, my pizza arrived and his video started😃
Could you compare suzuki Jimny vs Mahindra thar
I want to know what car the test driver drives day to day
That car is freaking fast,  Matt's reactions though 😂
This is the worlds fastest car....Just wait for the Jesko absolut. It will completely destroy the Chiron.
Schoolboy click bait error in the title really disappointing 186mph is nothing for this car:(
W16 YOU MUPPET NOT W12
W16
Anybody else still waiting for them to go at 480km/h?
Sportowa Polska
The carwow fan in me wants to say drag race this Chiron against something but sadly I'm pretty sure they won't lend it out for that😒 .Would be nice tho..this thing hits the top speed of 1000cc Superbikes and keeps pulling with no let up at all
You have experienced the launch and the roll... Why you didn't asked him a 300-0 emergency brake?.
I love how dry and precise the German engineer is
Matt you deserve this opportunity
It’s 300kmh not mph.
i was waiting..., when u gona review chiron
I am liquid solid metal .... Cyberdyne Systems Series 800 Model 101..
Matt is an absolute G. First journalist 👊🏼
Wait is this an older video, as Matt said the fastest car he was in was a Tesla Model S even tho in the last Videos he was already driving a Taycan Turbo S and a 992 911 Turbo S with 10.1s in a 1/4 mile.?
...AND this is the big difference between this masterpiece and the others...it rides just perfectly and not like a tuned shaking "racecar"
1:36 I think is a w16 not w12
We made it guys.We officially are getting the recognition and acknowledgment carwow deserves. Good Job everyone.Especially the editor,Yes I see you working overtime. Kudos
But how much could I save through Carwow?
Huuwaahh you laugh all the way feeling exciting, that bloody fast. When is Chiron producing 2+2 or 1+2 seaters car..? A huge car like this should have space for 2+2 at least.. anyway it’s really really marvellous.. thanks guys..🤓☝️👌
Matthias malmedi was in first...
How much can I save on a new Chiron Super Sport through Carwow?
A dragracevideo with a Laferrari, Koenigsegg Agera RS and a Chiron would be an epic video. I'm sure it will cost a lot of effort but if you guys pull that off, you have a viral video for months......
Anybody notice how he said W12 instead of W16???
Matt is ONE LUCKY B*****D😂😂😂😉😎👍
The real question is . . . . . How much can I save on it through carwow? 😉😁
Kmh***
great video but clickbate title
Wow CarWow!!! Now this is epic!!!
All this HP to do 0-60 in 2.3 s... 0.5 sec faster than the gt2rs!!!!🤔🤔
Dang it, I thought I was going to go 300 miles an hour per the description but it only went 186 miles an hour. Oh well
Did you imagine how far Matt goes right now, to be invited with the engineer of Bugatti  Respect for that 🤘🏾
3,2,1- GO. *advert appears*
Koenigsegg: *"Hold my surströmming!"*
it's the first time that make carwow so exciting.
Matt was full of sweat at the end 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Try a Koenigsegg Regera
😢 Carwow doesn't have deals on this car, was hoping to get a good deal against my wifes Citroen C4 😜
1:40 W12? Hasn't buggati been making just W16s from the beginning (under the VW umbrella)? The Veyron, Chiron and even this has W16. Edit - i think matt was thinking of Bentley there for a sec😅
300kmh not mph
Not the fastest production car. Vw can say that til they're blue in the face.  They have to actually make 30 of them first of all and they have to make the run both ways. They aren't doing either of those. So until they do the agera RS is the fastest. If they're feeling brave let them challenge cvk. He's not too far away and he would be happy to accept.
300 km/h*....😒
This does 0-300 mph faster then my sq7 going to 60
Did he misread the HP? Wasn't it 1614 and  not 614? Lol. He's like a kid in a candy store! 😎
You are so lucky that reviewing this car too Matt!!! And I really love your reviews.
Hey Matt you didn't use the stick of thruth hahahahaha
1:36 its a W16
You are the first journalist
You lucky son of a.......
Did anyone else get a bit breathless with that acceleration?
Here before it's gone viral
You can just see the happiness in Matt’s eyes 😭😭
Lol he’s freaking out at 187 mph meanwhile some of do that on sport bikes daily. Also, the Tesla P100D+ gets to 130 faster at less than 1/30th of the cost. I make that last point only because almost no where on earth is there spots to reach that top speed of 300mph and the spots you can get there only provide for a few miles of it at best. Lol didn’t even get into fuel consumption at 250+mph.
But that was cool
plz heart this comment
So Bugatti let the owners do 270 but not 30 mph more
Did anyone realize the plants in the back of the car😂 7:45
Not "300mph" - 300 kph
Where is 'carwow stick of truth' for the exhaust? ;D
What country is this in
You haven't been in Bugatti
next time, koenigsegg
Thats a lot of money for a volkswagen ;DD
This was click bait you didn't hit 300mph
This was awesome man keep up the good work
Who else wants to see a drag race with it?
Is it 300 mph or 300 kmph,
They're not vents Homer told you they are speed holes.
Imagine doing a drag race on one of these hypercars
When your car reaches 60mph in 9secs, this car reaches 186 mph in 9 secs.
I can't wait to play this in NFS...that's the closest I'll ever get
6:50 matt: "ah yes, to reach 300 kmh we only used 600 horsepower, well lets use the rest of the 1000!"
Next video Matt: this is fast but not as good as the Chiron super sport
Imagine matt doing carwow stick of truth on chiron 🤣. They'll shov that stick right back up lol.
*300KPH
Some months later Koenigsegg is going to melt the Bugattis Chiron SS.
Bugatti straight up said "Well if they can afford the normal one..."
I was also thinking that
Eagerly waiting for Jesko vs Chiron carwow drag race
I'm a simple subscriber. I see a new carwow video, i press like 🤷🏻‍♂️❤️
Matt. It's a W16 mate.
1.000.000x better than the Divo.
If you look closely, you can spot a smile on Mat's face.  Seriously, I wish I had that opportunity too:D
Matt made sure he gets his countdown in🤣🤣🤣
Matt said it's a W12, but it's a W16. In fact, it is made of 2 4.0 V8 engines, same ones used in RS6, RS7, Panamera, Continental, Bentayga...
This is one of those times when I'm tremendously jealous of Matthew. Look at him just chilling in a £3.5million Bugatti Chiron Supersport 😡
"What a way to lose your Bugatti cherry !!" Not until you get to drive it yourself Matt  🤣🤣
Matt you are the best
Its not a W12, its a W16
christian von koenigsegg doesn't let mat shit on passenger seat! do it matt
The eyelashes make it go faster, too.
I would love to see this vs the 911 turbo s
50-150 km/h feels like a blink.
Mat is the luckiest guy on Earth!!!!!!!
Just me that reacted about he talking about the fastest 1/4 mile mat tried before were a Tesla (10,4 sec) What about the Porsche 911 turbo S doing it in 10,1 sec?
But how much can I save by using the carwow website?
Gatti goes Brrrrrrrrrr
So Bugatti let the owners do 270 on their own but not 30 mph more 🧐🤨
Waiting for drag race with this.
That's not 300mph it's 300kmph
Missed a trick without doing 100-200kph
300 mph = 480 km/h, the speed was 300 km/h, wtf
When you were near the exhaust, I was thinking that you're gonna put something in that to see if it's real 😂😂😂😂
Matt's laugh was hilarious 🤣🤣
i thought you were acctually going to go 300 mph
Isn’t the fastest car Matt has driven in a quarter mile, the Porsche 911 turbo s which did 10.2 seconds.
Amazing
5:05 the taycan was faster tho wasn't it?
Tell you what. Keep the car.....give me an Audi RS6 Avant and an Audi RSQ8 instead and i will be happy :)
Sweet
What the hell the thumbnail is 300mph but he goes 300kmph fraud  and too many ads
Hell yeah
You're not wearing the mask properly though, and it's really bugging me.
Looks like way to much fun to be work and that’s exactly how work should be love it
Ok, how much can I save on this on Carwow?
Wooowww Congrats Mat!!
Gatti goes Brrrrrrrrrr
W16 mate not a W12
Actually they did 300 kmph not mph
No liar christiano ronaldo has that car and the buggati LA voiture noire costing 18 million
I want to see how much i can save on this new bugatti
We will all remember this video as the Bugatti drive with Mouth Guards #2020
1:34 did you mean 8 litre W16? Because I swear I heard W12. Edit: I changed the Time Stamp to 1:34 instead of 1:36
Isn't it 300Kmh? 300mph are actually 480kmh
3 sec 100-200 🤨
Matt is so kind compare with the engineer 🤣 You are the best Matt
1:35 W16, Mat...sixteen!!
Awesome german Humor of the engeneer :D
I'm disappointed that Matt didn't use the suitcase 💼 or luggage 🛅 bag for practicality and didn't fit a child seat. Bugger in Matt's British accent
1:34 Surely you mean W16?
My car when my father full sends it it can only reach 151 kyphosis only at a clear road not even half of the top speed
Still very fast, still very fast
When he started laughing, i pretended like Matt is the Joker of DC universe
Bugatti cannot loan it for a 1/4 or 1/2 miles race the result would be poor I think....Chiron vs tesla ?
When the video was ending i thought he was about to say want to know how much you can save on Bugatti Chiron super sport 😂😂
But how much can we save on it through carwow?
300km/h not mph!!!
it looks like it was 3d printed to be honest...
I guess that was 300 kmph
And in need 4 speed there'd still be a Police SUV trying to overtake.....
Wasn't it a W16?
His laughter though 😂😂😂
Its not an official Mat Watson 0-62 without his specialist timing gear though is it!!
Why does he say that the chrion is the fastest car in the world when köenigsegg is clearly much faster??? I’m confused.....
Next episode should be reviewing the slowest car you can buy new. 😂
Ooo
3,2,1 go   ad comes in
bugatti is done next koenigsseg ?
Is this the same test track where James May tested the Veyron Supersport top speed?
1:35 W12? 😂
Dang 300 *kilometer /h* just like that... Sad we don't have road tire that can stand more that 300 mph or what ever world record right now
“Want to see how much you can save on a new Bugatti?” Oh wait...that’s not happening isn’t it?
This is 300kmh not 300mph
You should get more exclusives Matt. I kno its genuine because Matt keeps laughing...euphoria
That last comment "What a way to lose your Bugatti cherry" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's time for you to ride the Suzuki Hayabusa.
SuperCar Blondie will very jealous ... 😁
Did they apparently get this black body plastic from Octavia Scout?
if youre wondering about social distancing in a bugatti
This video makes me feel especially poor😔
300mph? km/h?
Umm.. I don't think that Matt's gonna poke the car vents and exhausts with a stick like he normally does #Carwow
3:13 stop vith za questions English!
koenigsegg fanboys incoming
Man alive. What a job matt has, to be able to   review and drive awesome cars all day, travel around. Sign me right now 😍
So Bugatti let the owners do 270 on their own but not 30 mph more 🧐🤨
So matt didn't even drive the car. He was just seating on passanger seat
No matter how impressive the Chiron is, I would have an "Egg Agera RS" instead.. Ofc im just dreaming, but you get what im saying!
Wowowowowurujujui!! At last 😁😁😈
Yoooooo. 🤘😎🤘 I like the Bugatti Chiron.  Its my dream car .
I’m proud of you mat
stick of truth is triggered
Car reviews are my music     But THIS is my jam
Change title to km/h.
Can you try to review some more affordable cars, rather than super cars, Audi, Mercedes, bmw ...
Ready when you are for the drag race... What we putting up against it? 🤔 Might be the fastest car but if you had to try your luck what car your bringing ✍🏼
Mat: goes 300+ km/h  Also Mat: "I don't feel like i'm going fast"
How much can I save on carwow?
Reaches 200mph before my car can reach 60mph
300 kph is like 186 seems so low for that car but it’s a testing model So oh well
Who else expected clickbait
The driver's way of speaking gives me strict teacher vibes
I am disappointet, the video title says 300mph... not km/h
0 / 300    km/h   14 sn Torque monster Waowwww.
I wouldn’t let you drive that either lol.
It makes me happy to see Mat happy, thoroughly enjoyed the video. Keep it up Carwow!
The German accent of the driver has is just awesome
300kph not mph
He only went 185mph...
Ooh 42 minutes ago #EarlyGang
.
Bugatti can never be as sexier as ferrari design And the sound is not so great too
The real question is how much could you save on a brand new chiron with carwow?
not super accurate but i timed the 0-250 in under 10 seconds...
Why is Matt's mask crooked, i can't stop looking at it! 😭
1:36 Matt said W12. Chiron has a W16
300 km/h *
Well done Matt, happy for you mate 👍🏽👍🏽
Matts enthusiasm is brilliant to watch 😂👍🏼
300 mph but it’s 300 kmph
i would be really interested in knowing what it takes to be a bugatti "evaluator"
4 seconds to 100km/h? but 15s to 300km/h?
3..... 2..... 1....... .......advertisement
You can save an average of 100000 pounds through carwow... Yay...
This should go viral all over yt😉
It's a good thing carwow will arrange a nice discount for me on this car. I'm sure Matt will this to his collection.
A rare video of 2 people who got the best jobs
Nice clickbait. 300mph is NOT 300 km/h. Thanks for wasting my time to watch someone drive 300. Wow
The engineer reminds me of Valtteri Bottas a lot.the way he talks lill by the looks too..
What about the 5 annoying things about this car
@carwow - it’s 300kph not 300mph 🤓
I would by Corvette and save so much money and have more fun.
Ive never seen Mat been happier....or more stoked...
You better use it for a drag race video
Wow every time he accelerates you out an ad before 🖕
On the speedo 0-100 km/h looks slow because the speedo is so big😂 But it is such a machine
Hopefully You didnt took you mom with you ...
Well the dash is in km/h so you went 300 km/h. Still amazing that you could be a passenger in that car, WOW
the amount off people who wanted to see matt drive
Has Mat managed to stop smiling yet? Lol what a lucky man!
300 KM/H.....
Imagine a Bugatti with an 2JZ engine
Petetion to Ban mph, use kmph.
the only car Matt's not gonna poke with the carwow stick of truth with, kinda disappointed tbh
Such an awesome video, loved it.
how much can i save?
His mask almost fell off
We need the carwow stick of truth. Are those exhausts real lol  😂😂😂
W12?
Damn you're a legend 😂😂
300 mph = 483 km/h
We want Drag Race 😎
I want to have mats job lol it's so nice
Yeah... I'll believe this car can go 300mph when I see it go 300mph. Until then, it's nothing but PR nonsense.
That wiring behind looks like a couple of pot plants.
Come again when Bugatti makes a PROPER 300mph AVERAGE run record. Skipping rules to be faster is all they can do, when a Regera accelerates 13 seconds faster from 0 to 400
That man don't say more than needed.
Matt "this car is like a mofuggin tesla but keeps the initial crazy acceleration throughout the whole 0-200 mph just bonkers mental insane I can't even!!!11" German engineer: "Ja."
So should I consider it, short list it, or just go ahead and buy it?
Did Matt just say W12 at Min 1:30. its a W16
Wow, that car is... Fast.
if that is mat's reaction to 300kmh I would like to see him reaching 490kmh
and should we  avoid consider shortlist or go straight ahead and buy it?
W12 or W16?
W12 😂😂😂
Masks?? 🐑
One random person who likes this will be rich in 2 years.
Carwow probably has a deal on this car that could save you 10%
I'm not buying until you shake the centre console to test the quality of build.
Fantastic video. These types of videos are all over youtube, but Matt truly brings you into the car and helps you experience what he is experiencing without trying to look cool for the camera or driver.  Had a smile on my face the whole time, well done!
Lucky you!!!!
This a proper car review but one thing this time not even a lot of rich people can afford it 😂
dodge demon fastet in Bugatti 😆❣️
Bugatti speedometer glides faster than my car tachometer😅😅
Fun fact: Yiannimize was hiding in the engine
kph*
Bloody hell...... 😳 the way the thing gets to 300km/h seems so effortless
Where's the carwow stick of truth???
Was expecting 300mph, but what we got was 300kph (180mph) :(
So when are we having this on drag races?
One question .  how it will handle a line change while doing a 250+..
1600 bhp should be at lease 2000
So no one actually says he hit 300 kph, and not mph?
Matt u said w12 its a w16
5:54-.  Mat - 3..2..1... YouTube ad starts playing
300 mph? i think it's 300 kmph
Engineer seems to be very excited
300mph? 300km/h?
1:35 Mat says “W12”  but it’s actually a W16!  Edit: when I typed Mat on my phone it auto-corrected to May. Ah well, “Muphry’s Law”, right? (btw “Muphry” is not a typo)
Race this against the new porsche 911
Speedometer shows km/h and title says mph...
Mat, you deserve it! I've been watching you since your earliest carbuyer reviews and you've never skipped a beat. You're a legend! Keep being your creative self mate, we love you!
The rocket of the ground= this car
why they didn't let mat drive it
Actualy he Never was 300 mph fast, it were 300 km/h
Now we wait for viewer to make a real comparison between the agera rs and chiron ss for acceleration test.
So they allowed Captain Slow to test drive the Veyron to it's top speed but wont allow you to do the same in the Chiron? lulz
90km/h in first gear xdd
STICK OF TRUTH WHERE IS IT  🤣🤣🤣
Bro the fastest car u ever been in is the new porsche 991 with 10.2 secs.. Lol
My car doesn't even do 0-100 kph in the time this does 0-300 kph😂
What about the stick of truth mat?!
👍👍👍
I felt like it took like 4 seconds to go to 100
someday Koenigsegg will find a way to beat that top speed
I’m pretty sure it’s a W16 Quad turbo ..
That man who tests that car he is luck as god
How much 1 can save through carwow.?? Matt
Hey matt, big fan please likee❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
So, Matt thought Tesla model S was the fastest? 😂😂😂 Damn! He's been all wrong this time. 300mph where the fuck are you going 😁😁
It's like a girl loosing her cherry to Cristiano Ronaldo
Mat thinking thousand times whether he should do the exhaust test using stick or not. .?
It's astonishing and i loved ur reactions awesome
Matt's knee dangerously close to that big red button Me: 😓
Looks like no one cleaned the front vents of the car
Show off.
the new bugatti got that w12 bentley engine 1:34
honestly it's quite slow from 0-100 km/h... or maybe the driver push up the throttle a little bit calm...
Christiano Ronaldo is one of those 30 customers.
What about this exclusive Supercarblondie? xdd
4:59 liarrr
ok, but why are you carrying 2 boxes of tools and cables back there?
Matt it's a W16 not a W12.
That’s a true German engineer: cold and calculating
€20,- says the new 911 Turbo S will beat it to 62 mp/h.
Where is the king ??  Koenigsegg agera , one day matt will bring ⚡
That chuckle and laughter of fear and discomfort. . . . . . .
Yo the turbos kicks in on 50km/h
I suppose I can save several million from carwow
Matt what is your final verdict on this car? Should you avoid it,consider it,shortlist it or go right ahead and buy it or you can’t afford it.
Wheels look like £100 halfords job
So pissed they didn’t let you drive it Matt! They actually think their engineer would do a better job than you??? LAME
Bro I can't find the savings on this car on Carwow........
the engineer is the most german german i have ever seen.
That Thing just did 100 kmh in first gear
Come on konigsegg break 350
awww, look at Matt being all excited and happy. :]  I honestly find it adorable.
finally. mat wearing a mask
W12?😂
isn’t it quad turbo W16
The only problem with this car is I cannot afford it.
I do not trust the Bugatti exhaust unless its poked with the Carwow stick of truth 🙏
Bugatti is good👍👍👍
This car looks odd without a license plate
Wtf is on the engine? It looks like flowers
That’s km I don’t c mph
What's the 0-60 in this like what....1 second?
3 2 1 Go! ADVERT
Avoid it? Or should you just go ahead and buy it?
But... The speedometer goes to 500 mph 😞
Congrats Mat! Living the dream!
thank you Matt for doing a bugatti Chiron review🙂
1:35 it's a W16 not a W12!
Bugatti does not trust anyone with their press cars.
I still maintain the best car ever 👍🏻🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Can I save £3000 on Carwow on this?
Didn't Shmee already drive this?
05:22  It's 300km/h, not miles
Geeez that engineer had the charisma of a toaster oven
I feel sorry for that guy  he had to dumb down everything he said by a million times for this video
They are not sold in South Africa. Anyways lemme watch, and dream of owning one. Flip I own one in my fantasy world.
Powerful machine 🙏💪
Matt is a bit of a wet wipe for not poking it with a stick. were you scared ;)
Matt don't u wish u hit the 500 km mark?😂😂
its actually 300km/h not mph
Imagine a tesla is still faster then that
................2:45 in and..................a mask..............smfh..................  Either of you have less than .005% chance of getting the covid.... Read a book mate.
Bugatti should make a ride at Disney world
Did Matt said that it has a w12??
5:06 for the lift-off
I’m assuming Manny Koshbin has snapped one of these up!
wait what they actually did the Bugatti  review i cant believe   THANKS CARWOW FOR THE REVEIW         BUT WAIT HOW MUCH WE SAVE ON BUGATTI THROUGH CARWOW
2019- stay away from negative people  2020- stay away from positive people   Pls read my name.....
SL65 VS M8
Lol Matts got that schoolboy feeling..... those exhausts look evil
U can tell the speed picks up from 150kph up. Its mental
Hypercar owners,please allow carwow to review your car.
1:35 it's actually w16
So 0-60 in ?
It was 300 kph not 300mph
W16...not W12
And now for the car to go back in a rich guys garage and never see the light of day again 😭
Yianni is going to be well jealous
Bugatti: 300+ Koenigsegg: hold my strüdël
Can i get that car on carwow?
Was expecting u to hit 300mph what a shame
Matt, you did not rep the 911 turbo s's 10.1 seconds?
Nice job Matt! You are literally my inspiration to pursue my dreams.
Sorry.. but koenigsegg is the fastest car ever built.
That German accent of the engineer XD
Is this the engine or flower pots behind them?
It's a W16 not a W12 Matt :)
Thought this was click bate but my gosh this channel has moved faster than most super cars
I call bullshit. Where's the portal to the Racing Realms?
Класс моя любимая
I have two videos on my channel of the Chiron SS 300+
This car looks so much better than the standard Chiron in my opinion. That long tail is just what the car needed, the same way the fender flares are just what the dodge charger needed.
1:34 just a little oopsie... It's a w16 😂😂👍
W12 engine🤔
*300 km/h
Wow
Is that AMG written on his mask?
Mat is just in his own leauge,cool cool video
Y e s
He didnt say how much money i can save from carwow for this bugatti...
I was hoping for a test using the Stick of Truth Matt.. Disappointed..   P.s: Congrats Matt, you and this channel has made it..
Should you avoid it, consider it, shortlist it, or right ahead and buy it?
imagine if Bugatti came out to see Matt poking their £3.5m hyper car with a twig up the exhaust
6:51 the mistake is when you were saying how much power you were using. you said 614 horsepower instead of 1614
Didn't the speedometer say kph not mph?
But you didn`t even go more than 300 km/h. Where`s 300 mph? Good job.
Hi matt why don't test drive Zach's garage koiensegg regera rs please 😂
Look at that car it looks amazing especially in that black 👍
That acceleration from 200 to 300...
He's so excited it makes me happy watcing
THE LAUGH
So should I avoid it, consider it, shortlist it or just go ahead and buy it?
WOW! I think we are all giggling like school children when he put his foot down!! Thanks Mat :)
who got an ad just before he said go?
Batmobile
I felt every bit of that without actually feeling it
When he said go the ad pulled up on my block
Liar liar you went 300 kmph not mph
300kph not mph 😬
My name Jeff
Yeaaah I shat myself when  I saw the title  Car WOWWWWWWWW
So excited to get my Chiron next week! I can't believe I'll have a Hot Wheels Bugatti
No one cares if your the 1st
“dOeSnT iT?”
When a car is much more than your flat ! woooow
The look in your eyes while accelerating 😂
1:34 it's not W12 it's W16
W16 Matt not W12
One word: Koenigsegg
Funny how Bugatti claims that the tyres for a Bugatti was especially designed everytime they luanch a new model yet they have beaten Koenigsegg's record
Did anyone realize that they told 300mph(482kmph) and got there at 187mp(300kmph) 🤣😂??
Well i can afford that much speed in near future in ninja h2 :D
Mat obviously didn’t use the carwow stick of truth while having a Bugatti engineer watching him
THIS IS CLICKBAİT
Mat i guess it has a W16?
I Feel very sorry for those poor people who bought the simple chiron. Shame on you vw.
The second 0-100 doesn't seem as fast as i expect...anybody with the same doubt?
Normal Merc, Audi BMW get easly 300 kph!
how could you even sit in such a slow car matt
mat is not allowed to drive... the engineer knew that he would drive like a maniac in it
lol
I'M THE FIRST PERSON TO DRIVE WHAT?!?! **GONE SEXUAL** (WORLD EXCLUSIVE) **MUST WATCH UNTIL THE END**
Cup holders anyone?:)
I thought at the end he was about to say ‘Want to see how much you could save on a new Bugatti? Go to Carwow.’ 😂
I think first time he was sitting near the diver seat and giving reviews 😄
I'm surprised the drone did not destabilize from the aerodynamic forces
Can you buy a Bugatti throw carwow? and  how much will you save on it 😃😃😂?
How much can I get off one through Carwow? 😂👍🏻
thats 300km/h not 300mp/h ....
Try a koenigsegg and will be much more fun .
Well done Mat Watson. You've come a long way.
This is noise insulation! 300 kilometers per hour, but it sounds like 70. Koenigsegg's is much worse
Where is the stick of truth?
What an absolute dream invite !! I think it looks so much better than the current Chiron !! Some lucky buggers are going to have some fun !!
Here before it blows up
So this car has a 700kg engine... Well thats a little less then then my maruti suzuki 800.
Missed opportunity to say "Want to see how much you can save on your next Bugatti Chiron? Head to carwow"
But...but... what about the stick of truth test?
The address is different with fact..!why?
Change the description its not 300 mph
Sorry, be a bugatti engineer to drive it
Why didn't they let matt drive the car. The review felt quite incomplete without matt actually driving the car. Would love to see a drag race too.
Can't wait to save an average of £3000 on this baby!
Imagine seeing him driving that on the airstrip...
I thought at the end of the video, he was going to say, "want to see how much you can save on a new Bugatti Chiron"? Me thinking, well I hope it is a bit more than the usual 2k of Carwow.
I wish I'd own that some day😅
1:35 W12??
*it is NOT the fastest Car in the World. Come'on MATT* 😅😆
Matt: *imma count it in, 3 2 1* Youtube: *Ad*
YES
As much as i love Bugatti, saying that it is the fastest car in the world, gives me anxiety. Its just so wrong
Charisma dripping out that engineer . .NOT!!!
Why am i so happy for Matt like proud parent lol
Bugatti 🇨🇵
WRONG.. Koenigsegg is the fastest road car in the world.. Bugatti is tuned if thay tune the egg it will do 330mph.. Watch this space..
U better not check the exhaust with stick😂
well that escalated quickly.
5:28-5:32 it actually uses its spoiler for aerodynamic braking, just like an airplane!
Mat Watson - putting the G back into giddy !!!!!
You're not the first,Misha Charoudin did it first...!
HEY MAT PLEASE HEAR ME CHİRON VS KOENİGGSEG DRAG RACE
Hi
Does it comes with spare tyre?
It's can't beat the Porsche 911 turbo s in drag race! Lol😂 cause it's way too fast 10.1 sec
What are those flower pots doing at the back tho 😂😂😂😂😂
Its W16 right?? Mat it aint w12
I thought the 911 Turbo S was the fastest with 10.1 sec
“iSnT iT?”
8:00  Me too Matt, me too
I read the title so quickly I thought it read Matt actually went 300mph and was skipping all over the video to find the part only to be dissapointed when I reread the title.
Click on the top right hand corner to see whether Mat is alive!!!!!!
I hope the Koenigsegg guy watch this and then they invite Mat
When I say the thumb nail, I knew mat was gonna be so pumped ahahaha
What are all those cables at the back ?
car-wow indeed.
Should of done a better thumbnail
1:35 Its not an W12, its an W16!
That bugatti reaches 300 faster than my dads car reaches 100
Awsome
Why didn't you test exhaust vent Iam disappointed 😒
What it must feel like to have one of the best job's in the world
But how did Koenigsegg get the same horsepower number and more torque out of an engine that's got half the cylinder and turbo's?  Still, this Bugatti is really amazing, but I'm a Koenigsegg fan.
Matt : 3..2..1..go!          Uber ad pops in 😑😑
Congratulations 👏🤩🤩🤩
Mat is like: „Go to carwow and save 90% off a Bugatti Chiron super sport...“  Me: (still far away from being able to buy one) „well ......thanks Mat❤️“
Mat I think I should get your job cause you couldn't feel you had been to 300km/h twice 😅 tsk tsk!
Its 300km/h and you wrote 300m/h
0:16 Matt looks like a kid that just received the Christmas present they've always wanted
0:33 Triiiceeps
We need a drag race against yanni
They had us in the first half not gonna lie.
carwow: "I'm the FIRST to go in the 300mph Bugatti Chiron Super Sport *WORLD EXCLUSIVE*"  Shmee150: AM I A JOKE TO YOU?!
Woooow
woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow
The Hennessey venom f5 f80 is the fastest road car in the world with 1817 hp and it goes. 304 mph that goes 301 mph you should try it out
@carwow Are you sure it was 300mph?
Could the engineer be more bland with his answers?
Laws of Physics: No, you can't do that! Bugatti Chiron Super Sport: Haha, horsepower goes vrrrroooom!
holy fuck thats fast
Right that's it i'm starting to save up for one now! Quick maths, including depreciation and inflation, I'll be able to buy one by the time i'm dead.
I have a bugatti chiron too
Meanwhile I've never been first on a YouTube comment  🥀
just wait for the koenigsegg
He forgot to tell that it is still not as much fun to drive as Mercedes AMG or BMW....
5:37 Mats :"So it'slike a Tesla..." Engineer: 👀😒😠 Mats: "...for the first seconds." Engineer:👀😒😠
Matt released his inner child when he launched the Bugatti
Is it 300km/h? Or 300mph?
It’s not 300 mph it’s kph
Good for you matt, so glad you are doing this, you deserve it!!
It anyone going to say anything about the 2 plants behind the back windows?
Why does title say MPH when car is going 300KMH?  Which makes it actually 186 MPH...?
That aceeleration was crazy and Matt's reaction was priceless. Wish we could've seen his entire face
start booom 300km just like that
I thought it said 1st to go 300mph in a customer chiron ss
Finally a channel gets the cool cars before Doug, I just find Doug's videos impossible to enjoy because of his voice
it's a W16 Mat not a W12 at 1.34
So you spent 3,5 million Euros on this car and first thing you notice is that chips fall out from the front grill? It has some discoloration due to being hit by gravel I guess?
Plz change the title from 300 mph to 300 kmph
Whaaaaaaaattttttt!!!!!! 😆😆
Didn't poke the stick of truth???   So what exactly happened ?  **Access denied..**
Matt is the best car reviewer I saw.
How much I can save on this bugatti from carwow ?
The side and rear views are good, but it's still pug-ugly from the front (though better than other Bugattis) 🙁
*3:20* "evaluation ride for collecting data for further evaluation"   Noice!
Probbaly after matt experiences this the second fastest he might consider is only the tesla😅
Whats the point of paying 3+ million dollars for a car that doesn't even go 300mph? I mean thats the main point of the car isn't it?
Drag race  Bugattis in the channel @carwow
And now, for the carwow stick of truth.
No Carwow Stick-of-truth there right?😂
Where is the carwow stick of truth
W16 not W12!! lol
Mmm, lets see. This car or a Prius.
300 mph?! I saw 300 kmph. Clickbait?
This or a Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut or a McLaren Speedtail?
@matt Watson. You bloody legend
In title 300mph in vidéo 300klmh ???
I'm sorry but I'm glad its not blonde chick who did it first
Isnt the fastest car, that you had driven, in the 1/4 mille the 992 Turbo S with 10.1 secs?
5:54  3, 2, 1 - GO! *Gets the ad for SwytchBike*
Sucks that you weren't going Vmax even closely.
Jeez
congrats
I don’t know if they saw my comment but I asked for this.
I think matt just came
now I started to appreciate you
wait. it max out at 300 kmh and in the title it says 300 mph
This bugatti is not an hypercar it's something else.....
Sorry bugatti but this audi r8 is quicker  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGa7BSXOdJs
How much can i save on this with carwow?
Gonna see if Carwow can get me a deal on this bad boy
“Want to do it again?”  I mean is that even a question?
Just like a Mclaren F1 Longtail, It's beautiful
You can recognize from the lack of humor that the driver is indeed German.
Nah! I feel like Koenigsegg Jesko is still faster
a 1000+hp supra can smoke this car 😏
seulement 300 moins rapide qu'une lambo dommage de ne pas la poussé jusqu'a 420
cant wait until you can do this in the jesko
You can see the smile on mats face
OMG Bugatti???!?!?!?!
In 10 years I will be a owner of a brand new Chiron💪So help me God❤
Matt in this video is much like a fan boy...
come on boy  Koensiegg Gemera can do 400 km/h
Эхх был бы русский перевод
I’M WAITING FOR THIS ONE I KNEW THIS VIDEO GONNA COME
Matt : *asks  questions with full enthusiasm* Le Engineer: yes
If I go on to carwow, would I get a discount on this car? 🤔
Must be a great feeling, seating in the world beast
Admittedly I'm only 10s in but what about the Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut? 🤔
Where is your specialist timing gear mat????
It has a W16 not a W12
Doesn't it???
Dying to hear tht when Matt say click up on the pop out banner to see how much you can save on a BUGATTI CHIRON..!!😂😂
Click on a link below to see how you can save 250.000£ on one of this 😉 Hint: don't order fancy colour
Congratulations
so whats the carwow discount on the Chiron?
Matt's reaction tells everything
man i actually thought it was going to reach 300mph not 300km/h SMH
Mat: We're both hard at work!  Engineer: *profused sweating*
When he told go an ad came😡😡😡 anyone like me .
I can see his excitement 🤯
in the last part , I thought Matt will say ...click on up right hand corner to check how much you can save on a Bugatti chiron
Chiron goes brm brm
"the fastest car in the world, ever" lol Koenigsegg says hi:)
Your excitement levels are through the roof! I loved that.....brilliant!!
Omg
300mph?? 300kmh you mean? 🤔
Wish mat drove it
At 2:49 it looks like someone's put those fake eyelashes on the headlights 😂
So then what exactly happened?
1:35 it’s W16 lmao
Omg I’m so hyped for this vid
Can’t wait to see this Bugatti on a CarWow drag race
Came to see him go in 300mph.... 300kmh lol
The reaction you got from the acceleration, I swear I had the same! Blown away, adrenaline, happiness, scariness all together mixed. Epic! 🙌🏻☺️🤪🤪
29minsagoaye
1 request, drag race with yani, he can bring what ever he wants
5:54 ... 3 2 1 go... And ad
When i saw this video and when he said  3 2 1    Ad😑😑😑😑
Always great to hear a German Engineer speaking English 🔥  Best wishes from Germany 🤙
Mat : *asks a question* Bugatti Engineer : *YES*
Stick of truth?
How much can I save on one of these bad boys through carwow? 😆
And click here if you want to buy a Buggati Chiron SS
Before *Supercar Blondie* 👌🏻🔥✌🏻😂
Where are the Koenigsegg fanboys? LOL
One word:      Noice
The title says «300mph» but you only went 300kmh Big difference
Koenseigg fans must have disliked
Loving the houseplants in the back windows.
300km/h but still crazy tho
Finally, a Bugatti   Aaa he's not driving 😕
Me:I don't give a f*ck the Bugatti is not cooler than lazarbeam mulik. Everybody else in Britain: lazarbeams must not be that famous
Did Matt forget that he's been in 911 Turbo S?
Good job mate 👍👍
lambo vs buggati
Matt: "Want to see how much you can save on a new Bugatti?"
“Testing...it’s part of my job” Ok man no need to make us jealous
Wow this is awesome, wonderful mate 👍🏽
Disinfect the car first then when you have a friend to ride it too make sure you wear facemask and you friend too
how about wash the car before shooting footage of it ?
Supercar Blondie is watching this thinking, how did Mat manage to pull that one! Lol
the bmw fanboys will still claim that the i3 is quicker
Kilometres per hour or miles per hour😂
That was insane how this car crossed 300 mph  money can buy speed ..
Very nice G force office you have there,Wow!  Greetings from Canada.
small mistake in the title :(  its 300 km/h  not 300mph
I want to see you in a koenigsegg! Great vid btw!
Like & Leave it for 💰
the speedo climbs faster in this thing  than the Revs in my hyundai in first gear
That guy just didn’t want to have a conversation like he just tried to talk as minimal as possible
waiting for the supra fan boy who doesn’t even own a supra to say the supra is the fastest car in the world.
Spot the deliberate mistake. 300 Kph not Mph lolol
That has got to be the best job in the world seriously !
Why didnt you talk about the infotainment system?!
Is't it??? Lmao
The way that speedo moves from 150-300 is almost as quick as 0-150 !
We can see the kid in you. 😆 funfunfun.
Played us in the beginning 🤣🤣🤣
Next Valkyrie pls mate
4:56 WRONG MAT! IT'S NOT THE TESLA MODEL S, IT'S THE PORSCHE 911 TURBO S 2020 THE FASTEST CAR YOU'VE BEEN IN AND DROVE. 1/4 MILE 10.1 SECS COMPARED TO 10.4 ON THE MODEL S
If the speedometer moves that quick, imagine how quick the fuel level moves 😂😂
This was just the best 🤣🤣🤣
Matt Watson for next top gear presenter
Matt- FFS I have to wear a mask just for the sake of it !
Says 3 2 1 before launching the car and the moment he says 1 a Porche ad pops up Wow
4:59 Wrong : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4zilQLGdfs😉
I'm disappointed Mat  No stick of truth 😔
Damn this car just accelerated to 100 with 1 gear only
Matt, this was 300km/h, which is 186m/h. 300m/h would be 480km/h.
My boy matt moving up the ladder
THAT'S WHY WE LOVE #CARWOW
When are you getting your hands on a Yaris GR?
Can't wait for this to be in the next big rap video.
You should have given the engineer the stick of truth and then see if he was more receptive to you driving it
The first Bugatti in carwow.Is that wow?
Pointless, waste of space, and money!
Yeah carwow I'd like to know how much i can save on  a bugatti Chiron 300+ , please!
I missed the part where Mat acutally shows us, how much we could save on our new Bugatti Chiron Super Sport trough their trusted Carwow dealers :(
Matt is one lucky boi.....
Love this video , can you pls shout me out
So the W12 makes more power than the W16
Matt: 3,2,1 GO  YT:Ah Here is a ad my friend
1:35 He said W12, its a W16, apart from that, good video mat 👍🏻
Did you check the exhaust so that they are surely carwow stick of truth proofed?
300KPH!
There wasn't that much speed in this one to be so impresed, there are cars that drive 300 kmph on the autobahn and cost 1/30 of this..
Yup.   Matt bought a Chiron SS
So the first person to test that car is from Walsall!! As a West Midlands lad myself, this makes me so proud. Get in there Matt!! 💪💪
title said MPH...in video its KPH
7:30 “working” 😂😂😂
The video tittle say 300mph, but he goes 300kmh, it is a big difference there.... but ok
Happy for you Mat👏
Im the second guy 🙇🏽‍♂️🙇🏽‍♂️
Man
Does it do 300mph, he didn't mention it
French car
The Bugatti engineer is German isnt he
Wawoooow carwow
It's not bad, is it?
Can you do a drag race with a Bugatti please
I wish mat had a chance to drive it.. That reaction would've been more fun.
1:35 W16 NOT 12
He launches at 5:05 you’re welcome
I dislicked the video so i could be the 100 dislike
Please  mat
Faster than Speed.
The first to sit the chiron ss is the driver😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Mat I don't wanna ruin your day, but the speedo counted in kph and not MPH☹️ So you have driven 190 mph and not 300
i feel bad disliking bc pretty sure he really thinks kph is mph
Is it just me or did he say W12??
He talked about 300 miles per hour  And it was only 300 kilometers per hour ,  I'm sooooo disappointed! LOL!!
Did he really butcher the name in the beginning, 'The Bugatti Super Sport'...isn't it the Bugatti CHIRON super sport? lol
Ive never seen Matt so happy in a car review
That's what I call car wow!
Matt what with the mid roll ads  Its ruin experience and can you please change ad  . You get trill about the launch and bam stupid commerical ads man it ruin man  I know u need make money but mid roll ads are annoying as hell. Saw 3 ads video in a 10 mints videos please do something about this ! Please
Matt: What is the meaning of life? Driver: yes
This channel just went next level
Matt its w16 not w12
It is so quick
This is the only thing not in our channel!
Is it the carwow 1/4 mile king tho 🤔
If there is any vid that will reach 1 billion Views it is this one.🙏🙏🙏👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😁😁😁😁🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love the ecstatic laugh! But seriously though, the Porsche 911 Turbo S recently dethroned the McLaren 720S; how about Matt in a Veyron, Yanni in a McLaren 765LT and Joe Achilles in Koenigsegg Jasko
Ahah that reminds me so much when I saw the Chiron at GoodWood Festival Of Speed, it came onto the track and seemed slow and cumbersome and big.. then the driver floored it a bit and by God it roared and flew!! Very quick and luxurious cars.
They better hit 300+ mph in a production/customer car... Or else the record would be insignificant
Fastest one was the Porsche
still I would be with the supra
How much force do you need? *Buggati's tires* : Yes.
What's with the two plant pots in the rear view window? :)))
Click  the pop out banner to see how much you can save👍
That engineer has probably been doing engineering for so long that he literally became and sounds like a machine
No your not matt
You come a long way mate
Waited for you to make a video of Bugatti 🤘🔥
I want it! I hate VW, but this Car is amazing!
Want to see how much you can save on a new BUGATTI, just dream it
I think it accelerates faster  from 200-300kmh than my car 0-100 😂
Matt: touched pedal Bugatti engineer: Y O U  C A N T   D R I V E  A  C A R
Congratulations mat
One of those very rare occasions wherein a little less talk would have been better।
I looks amazing in those wheels
Not too late for all the recognition matt & carwow team deserves!
That is a lot of sensors and themocouples on top of the engine! 😮
"Want to see how much you could save on a new....car" 😂. I was totally expecting Mat to say "Bugatti Chiron".
Fun fact:the first car to ever hit 300+mlp barrier
start at 5:05, and don't thank me
Its supposed to be 300 KPH not 300 MPH
both koenigsegg Gemera and jesko are faster that this slow city car
3...2....1.. GO!!!! Porche presents soul stories
Der Bugatti Typ hat aber einen gut zu hörenden deutschen Akzent :D
Wait!! I thought its a W16??
i remember how Mat was once not allowed on a ferrari lot in an international motor show,and now he is one of the first to sit on a chiron ss 300+,TAKE THAT FERRARI
I thought at the end he was going to say, "want to see how much you can save on a new bugati chiron limited version" 😐😐,
Tesla Roadster will roast that
What's up with the 2 plants in the rear windows?
NARDÓ Circiut
Don't think I've ever seen Mat so excited! It's infectious
Tot M6-ele lui Andy Popescu e mai brutal 😂😂😂
what!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! man that's fast...... What is the 0-100kph?
Defender vs G class off-road capability
How much can I save on this car from Carwow?🤔
This is absolutely crazy I can't believe matt has actually gone and done it well done Mat
Matt:Fastest car in the world  Koenigsegg Jesko:Heard of me?
I've never heard Mat laughing like that , like a toddler! That acceleration is mind blowing!
It is not the Quickest Car,The Devel Sixteen is
That laugh at 5:13 when mat loses his marbles
I want to lose my Bugati Cherry too
20 minutes- 7.2k likes and 1,000 comments 😯 So glad this channel has come so far.
This Dude Sounds German ^^
Looks who can't use the stick of truth
Yeah Mat
9:44 Koenigsegg laughing in the Corner..
But i was looking for i much i can save on this through carwow.com.😭
Uploaded 25 minutes ago and 60k views already :)) you are rocking it. Shame you couldn't drive it
wow
300 kmph in a 300 mph+ buggati, nice
7:40. "Let's do it again, I can't remember" 😂😂😂
When r we going to see its drag race.?
such a cheap vehicle
On speedometer it showed kmph
This is why i Love you, man!!!! you're the best
I thought mat was joking when I saw the thumbnail actually 😂😂
Now just need Matt to go in a Koenigsegg
Mat has finally become Doug
This is not the fastest
Change the TITLE FROM MPH to Km/h please...
1:35 did it lose some cylinders somewhere???
I will always remember in the summer of 2020 when corona struck😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The hardwork that you did for this channel is paying off. Congrats mat and i am very happy to see your progress.
No you are not
Car made that engineer bald 😅
get a chiron and dragrace it against anything! :D that would be fun. so it's time for you, me and everybody else, to get someone who owns a bugatti lend it to you. so we all stand in a circle around that person and join in a chorus "do it! do it! do it!"
It looks like a fake version 😂😭
how much can i save through carwow for this
One day the stick of truth will retire......surely
I hope they change the wheels. They look terrible
What is the price after carwow discount??
You really can feel Mat’s happiness in this video
What’s with the eye lashes
The title says mph and he did kph. That annoyed me before I paid more attention to the wording of the title.
it was km/h not mph
6:12 am I the only one who noticed km/h in the HUD?
Wtf i think that l heard you said a w12 at 1:35 ,i'm sure that it's just a mistake because the bugatti chiron has a w16, matt watson is professionnel,  i know it, so it's just a mistake.
Matt- do you want to bay a Bugatti sherone ss.check out car wow app for best deals and offer's
Woah woah woah! Plz review the 2021 BMW 5 Series.
Matt: Want to know how much you can save on the new Bugatti, head over to carwow.com!
I’m jealous
Next you need the Jesko
Matt i don't think ur the first journalist to enter the chiron,it's Faisal Khan from india,but you are the first one to be that fast
what's the ¼ mile time??
why cant i find that bugatti on carwow for a cheaper price ? :/
The bugatti chiron is now in production they will only made 30 of that and now it can hold a 300+mlp production car record yeeeey!!!!!!😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
I missed the 5 annoying things
Surely I can’t be the only one who prefers Matt over that supercar blonde girl?
I see what you did in your last comment 🍒
No carwow stick of truth??
Count down for 2nd time  Mat: 1          2          3          Go  And the advertisement came...
I'm happy for Matt 😂
Fastist car 0-60 the 911 turbo s not a tesla!!!
It looked like it was faster from 100 km/h to 200 km/h than it was from 0 to 100. Crazy
WHAT ABOUT THE YARIS??
Did anyone Knew this was A ClickBait And suddenly it was not😂
3-2-1 Go! Nintendo advert, lol
WOW just WOW
DAMN! I really wanted to see what I could save on a Bugatti Chiron on carwow!
the title : 300mph chiron *my mind* “what a superfast chiron” in the video : woww, this car can go 300 km/h easily,  😳
cLicK bAIt?
I feel sad for that test driver...After all that 300+ driving whole day,  he must be going home in his vw golf...imagine what he must be feeling.....😀😄😀
The BEAST!
Was Yanni gutted much? 😂
when the english guy drives on the left side of the car
Kph then?
ummm.. kph is not 300mph... vastly different.
Koenigsegg jesko?🇸🇪🇸🇪
YES.
Cheers for bringing this to us.
Engineer had to be german :D
I have never seen a car with 500 mph in its speedometer
Nice
I've heard Matt said 8.0l W12. It's W16 bruh 🙄
It's W16
Mat u lucky youtube bugger of a bastard.
Where is the pop up banner that says how much you can save on this car
Loved the nervous laugh 😄
kph not mph
Wow awesome
Where were the 300 mph? I saw 300 kmh, which isn't that impressive at all. Unintentional click bait?
I'm Jealous 🤬😡
Imagine mat says "Want to save on your new Bugatti? Well then click on the deals box to your right to see how much you can save on a new car at carwow!"
You didn't tell us how much can we save if we buy it from your trusted dealers...
5:52 mat: 3,2,1  me: gets vw ad  coincidence i think not
This is ABSOLUTELY going to blow up this channel even more
https://youtu.be/z4zilQLGdfs Fastest time recorded on carwow in Porsche 911 turbo s 10.1 seconds.
i was going to buy it but then i heard that it will be limited to 275mph... thats a pass for me i guess.
Car wow: What are you driving. Me: a Bugatti
Hey Matt, do you ever take days off? no?nvm keep on filming =D
Bruh this car launches faster to 300km/h than my Civic to 50km/h
He's talking like you're gonna drive this car at 300 mph all the time. 3.5 million euros and you can drive it 120 kmph on drive way when you go to work in your factory.
Yes
German engineer , best in the business!!
It is 300 kmph and not mph... Huge difference! 08:38 , 6:51, 7:45, 7:59 Chiron is capable of 300mph but the video and title is misleading
So desapointed because of the adds
5:12    5:21  6:15
Are there any decent Carwow offers for this Chiron? 🤣🤣
Ah my baby coming soon, I'm excited
that's seriously fast. let's see how koenigsegg fight back
WOW. Well done for getting that ride👍
So happy for you Mat, congratulation,.
It is a larger car.
I know you're having fun there Matt
You lucky bastard
Sweet Jesus that guy never smiled once!! So so serious 😂😎
Matt should have used the stick of truth 😂😂
Do the same think in koenigsegg one 1
Reminds me from when mat reviewed that 1000hp supra. That initial shock from all that power must be insane.
5:12 First time hearing Mat laughing like that 😀👍
How much can I save with CarWow if i want to buy the Chiron?  Asking for a friend who also can't afford it.
I love how mat says whatever he can to make Chris take the Bugatti to 300 again
agera rs >bugatti
3:32  is that two pot plants in the little window behind them?
Good video, I feel he is totally bananas with the opportunity but.... does he even know about koegnisegg ?! Great car anyway bugg !
Wow this car is pretty similar my car! They are both black, and they have the same 15 seconds acceleration time! The only difference is that in those 15 seconds my car does 0-100 and this one does 0-300! Close enough
Buggati Veyron still
W16 not W12. Correction
Well this video was kinda clickbait 🤔😂😂
2:53 Mat Watson: "Is this the first time the Chiron Supersport has been here?"  Him: *yes*
I’ve put in the details of this car and u can save an average of 200k pounds on a brand new Bugatti Chiron sport through carwow
Still needs 14sec to 300.. So not that impressive..
Ummm it 300 Km/hr not mph :/ kInda disappointed
I wanted to hear "visit carwow to know how much you can save on the Chiron probably a million :)"
It‘s 1614 Hp used not 614 Hp 🙈 You forgot a thousand ther :D  (At 6:50)
👌🔥🔥🔥🔥👍⚡⚡
300mph in the title, 300 kmh in the video.
Extremely rapid....
How cool would it be if you raced a Chiron and an Agera
Двери как на оптиме закрываются
Somehow missing Captain Slow
It's cool, and amazing. I've been waiting for it for a long time.
300 Kph=184.4 mph
Matt is lying! it is not the tesla (10.4) but the porsche 992 turbo S(10.1).
3-2-1 Go! Cue advert 🤦🏾‍♂️😭
Yawn same old look
dont crash dont crash dont crash dont crash dont crash dont crash dont crash dont crash  dont crash dont crash dont crash dont crash  dont crash dont crash dont crash dont crash dont crash dont crash dont crash dont crash dont crash dont crash dont crash dont crash dont crash dont crash dont crash dont crash dont crash dont crash dont crash dont crash dont crash dont crash ................................dont crash dont crash dont crash dont crash     ohhh -> he is just a passenger
w16
What was 0-60 ?
this is your under 1 mill ticket like this
Man hört einfach das der Fahrer ein deutscher ist 😂
imange he buyed it
Such a tiny little car.
Lol even if it was like 60per cent discount i still wont be able to get it lol
Actually, the car does 302kmph despite being limited to 300kmph. Shoddy engineering 🤦🏾‍♂️
freak'n hectic... 🤗
@matwatsoncars What deals does Carwow offer for a new regular Bugatti Chiron?
At the end I thought he was going to say “see how much you can save on a brand new Bugatti”😂
This is why we love mat, really excited and just super happy being there. Happy for him to have that experience
That speedo flies like tacho.. 😅😅
Did he just say W12 instead of W16?
Matt giggling like a lil girl was priceless 😂😂😂😂😂5:15
BUT PEOPLE SAY THE TESLA IS THE FASTER
How! Did bugatti even think they could let Mat in one
Official Legend
Where's yani mouse!? 😋😋
In 14-15 seconds, it reached 300 kmph. From 07:44 to 07:58
Can I get a carwow discount on Bugatti Chiron Super sport?
5:12 That laugh tho 😂
This guy is like the terminator lol
Matt's giggle haha
Not everyone will be able to own or drive a Bugatti but the Lucky few should really enjoy it to the fullest 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Here before 1 million views
I want to know how much I can save on this car through carwow.
Konniseg coñoooo
The faster the car goes the crazier the laugh is ..
300km/h not miles
where's the stick of truth up those exhaust pipes......
Drag Race! I want to see Yanni rock up in whatever he can get his hands on and then Mat arriving in a Chiron SS. 😂
WOW!
I would be gutted to buy a car and then they limit it in speed to 275mph
Nice camry you got there man
Am I the only that kept smiling when they started speeding off?
Where is the specialist timing gear mat?
good for you man 👍👍👌💪
1:35 W16 not W12
Someone: what have you do today at work? Mat: same thing as everyday, review yet another car... Mar at work: acts like kid in the toy store 😂
Some guys would still say an mk4 Supra would beat this 😂
Nobody:   Bugatti: Yeah, we need a sportier version of this $3 million dollar car.
Found the two mistakes. At the beginning he said W12 and when they were talking about how much power they used he said 600 instead of 1600
The way it pulls from zero to 300 is madness!
The fastest car is Tesla roadster I wanna see the drag race between those two cars wen the time comes
Why did he have to make it all about him 😭😭😭🤣
Mat, luck is on your side!
As much as my swedish ancestry wants Koenigsegg to be the fastest car, this Bugatti fucks.
As previously stated, you have completed motoring Journalism.
Id doesn't look as fast in the video, from 0-100km/u
Matt: 3, 2, 1, Go! Ad: hello there...
Sadly he went 300kph to 186mph but if u tell me im wrong then there nothing i can say
Wanna see something weird click this 5:11
I dunno why Mat calls the “normal” Chiron normal. It’s anything but.
This video gave me goosebumps, God bless you Mat Watson, and thank you for this one.
I would sell my family for this car
She will look like a bike against Mercedes Project one
What are those plants doing in the back windows??
Now this is the most expensive car ever reviewed by matt😂🥵
Went to school with Mat in Darlington back in the 80s nice guy always loved his motors
W12? WTF dude that has W16
Do we get a carwow discount on this one? 😂
I don't understand heavy cars that are unnecessarily heavy.
Bugatti always making incredibly expensive cars but they are not the fastest. Just Sad.
Lol littelbit ducktape
bro its 300 km/h not miles
It's a w16 engine
So buggati do be faster than a koenigsegg
*I would say I am the the first to get into the comments section...*        but... i'm not :|
The title is a little click-bait like. He didn't go  300 mph, he went 300 km/h. I'd still watch the vid. But, c'mon guys...I do love Mat's authentic child-like excitement. I'd be just as giddy as he was.
Тупой англичанин, там w16
The back just became uglier
But what’s the average saving of one of these on carwow?
*Yanni would be so jealous after seeing this 😏😏*
Dont understand why they don’t just set the top speed record officially so they can get beaten again by the Jesko...
That gear stick is just wrong
When only one year ago Mat wasn't considered important enough to look at the inside of a car in a car show
Disappointed that there was no Stick of Truth, it's the least the engineer could do for you since you couldn't drive the car.
They didn't have enough money to add the gloss in the paint
Congratulations Matt. When will I be in one of these cars?
Buy you Bugatti on carwow, to save 10% on your Chiron, so you only have to work 3 lifetimes instead of 4.  jk awesome review
This is so racist why did the driver had to have a German accent ?
300 KM/H not MP/H.....very little detail. P.S the ferrari sf90 is much better in 0-250.
He is literally living my dream
That was 300km/h not mph
OMG
Will can we see Koenigsegg  video
Did u just say w12 🤪
They should put some 500hp electic engine on the top of 4 turbos. Than im interested
This is pretty cool, but I can't get a discount on this car so it's definitely a pass.
1:34 it is an 8.0 w16
Engineer is all business.
How much can I save using carwow fr this bugatti
0:37  At first I :😀 Then I:😔
1:36 W16*
Matt - im the first journalist? Engineer - (pause) yes that's a fact Matt - WOOP HIGH FIVE GET IN THERE!
The first few seconds is like a Tesla... lol, if only the engineer wasn't wearing a sunglass 😂
You didnt use the carwow stick of truth to check if those exhausts were real!!
Oooowowowowowowoowow hı carwow
Teacher: What's your hobby? Me: Watching car reviews which I can't afford
Koenigsegg is shaking right now
Finally a Bugatti on CARWOW🥺
So, when can we see it go 300 mph?
Unpopular opinion, maybe... but to me, this car looks so horrible. I always think people just like it because it is fast. While that is certainly a cool thing, it still looks as if ten designers worked on it and every one put the things in that they liked... and now, the car has no true line. It‘s just a soup of design features
Wow that was wicked
Just casual 0-300 km/hr pulls
Amazingly amazing
WHERE WAS THE STICK OF TRUTH!  Haha
My supra has a better acceleration
it's me or are there plants in the back????😨😨😨😨😨😨
W12??
Who would’ve thought a guy from walsall would be the first in that car
Its a W16 not a W12 (just saying)
Just wait for Koenigsegg fun boys
Back to reviewing VW Polo
In addition to listening to the sound of the engine continuing to pull, it was hilarious listening to Matt giggle like a little boy!
Funny thing is the Porsche 911 turbo s is faster 0-60mph and you could buy 20 of them for the price of the Chiron !!!
He closed the door like a uber passenger.
The excitement on his face was priceless before he had the disclaimer
Who else thought Mat comparing Bugatti with some other stupid thing in the intro as he does in other vids
Carwow I commented you to do a review of this car I think about a week ago, did I inspire you or you came up with the idea yourself?
i read the title wrong 😩
aaaaa happy for u Matt! Keep up w ur great contents! ❤️✨
*Anything matt asks* Engineer : yes/no      Simple. N calm.
Well he ain’t the first cause bare people have got this Bugatti 🙄🙄🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
😴😪
MAT is the Man!!! Another one of! Keep pushing my friend
Matt forgot to tell us how long does it take for 1/4 mile lol. He was too excited!
Thanks mat, for reviewing some practical, affordable, family cars at last
Carwow has grown soo much in a short period of time, I wish this channel the best😀😀😃
sir see Mahindra Thar its an Indian Car
isn't there a carwow deal for this?😂
Koeniggseggs are faster Fact
*300kph NOT 300mph* there's a huge difference
8 Litre engine bruh imagine going to the gas station and you have to go through traffic you'd probably lose half your tank on the way home
After seeing this video Im sure we will never see Koenigsegg on here?
It's my dream to see mat in Chiron or agera rs now he is 😊😊
*Me just casually watching another car review of a car I will never own*
w16 you needed to say.
Yianni please wrap my chiron for me in satin chrome red
Matt 321  Youtube balance
I suggested u
Disappointed, no "stick of truth" test !!!
What kinda discount will Carwow get me on one of these ?
I love that the spoiler goes vertical as soon as you brake, just to get more drag
Oooo nice car !!!!!
Mat said that this car has and W12 but it actually has a W16. Also he said it had 614 hp but it actually had 1614 hp.
7:29 killed me
This could've gone so wrong *cough* RICHARD HAMMOND *cough*
300 mph or 300kph??
Matt is one funny guy
So the car comes with succulents in the engine bay? Wtf  (This is a joke)
Nice one Mat!
Wait just try to vlog on Koenigsegg jesko or Koenigsegg one of one 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Now that’s a Wayne mobile!!!
The way he doesn't get to drive it🤣🤣🤣
I own of the 30                     not quite but in 2030 I will
Name should be  Bugatti Chiron LT
omg the comments 666
The jesko is faster
So when 300 mph?
Where is the stick of truth?
where's the stick of truth? 🥺
This was a very serious and professional review. Did you guys  not see Christian wipe all that sweat from his forehead?
Can't wait to see a drag race against this Bugatti and the 911 turbo s; who will be the new king of the drag🤔
Did anyone realize that this was the costliest car Matt has ever reviewed and also the fastest
Congratulations mat ❤️
W12 engine?? Guess again Matt
Bruh😦
Thats 185mph not 300..still fast as hell!
It’s hilarious how excited Mat gets..and genuine..very cool
Incredible mat it's just amazing but for your information I have been in a buggati Veyron and in a pagani chinque roadster.
How much can I save on this Buggati?
Check out the deals on Car Wow and save up to £4000 on a new Bugatti Chiron Super Sport
Buggati : We make fastest cars in the world. Koenigsegg : Do you ?
Big Dawwgg now!

I love to see Matt so happy when he reviews this types of cars
Why does it look like there is plants in the engine bay
How much will i save when i buy it through Carwow???
I laughed and smile like a lunatic just watching this video. I can’t even imagine how it would be to experience this. Bugatti.

"I'm not allowed to drive this car"  Me: I can't even go to France to see this thing in my very own eyes....
Very nice to see. I can only imagine the power...very nice.
I finally understand how fast you go because I don't understand the miles per hour :)
Pog Champ
The panel gap on the rear (long tail) is disappointing.
5:18
Everyone liked that.
If anybody can get me to level 100 I am at level 87 rn I will gift you something no joke
*Imagine if Mat managed to drive it and crash it*
Look at his face he’s so happy hahahahaha
Can I get a carwow discount?
YESSS MAT CONGRATS👍👍👍👍👍
I really say it from my heart if mat would be driving he would surely cross more than 300 😊😋🙂
300mph? It' kpg

Was waiting for the 5 annoying things about the Chiron 300+. 😂
Wow u got a boogati
What an achievement matt!
finally🙄, Matt drives a Bugatti
what is that wire salad behind the drivers in the back...I guess Bugatti said just leave it...we did everything else great...LOL
YO title says mph, but it.s km/h
How much can you save on this through CARWOW?   😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
They have the internet from NASA or what???
This is saying fastest car in the world. Don't Koenigsegg jesko figures say different. Don't get me wrong I'm a fan of the Bugatti but Koenigsegg are just ahead of the game
To see what deal you can get on the Bugatti Chiron Super Sport, go to carwow.co.uk
I wish I could experience that moment before I die.
You can buy a small jet for that money.
that acceleration is just completely insane!  I want you to be in a Koenigsegg Agera RS now!
“Bugatti cherry” 😂
It is km/h no mph🤭😏
shouldn't be 300km/h or 188mph?
but does he have a cup holder
Lol
I'm Canadian and we use kilometers here. Is 300 mph around 500 km/h?
How much can I save on this car threw the Carwow website?
Hi matt... please review about r34
Funny to see the Koenigsegg pass it
I was hoping you would say: "Wanna see how much you can save on a brand new Bugatti Chiron super sport 300+?"
You must be kidding
300 km/h
Matt I can confirm that you have gone clear
1:35 that line seriously triggered me
I am sorry
Awesome Car !!!
wow
Pardon my French- I am F***king Jealous 😍
5:22 that’s a bonkers villain,lol
Kylie Jenner has it
Ich dachte zuerst das auf der Heckablage zwei Blumentöpfe mit verwelkten Blumen stehen würden 🤦‍♂️
The rarest thing ever happened   - full eclipse - crashing asteroid - she said "i love you by my heart, not your money" - a breaking down toyota - a super reliable land rover - Carwow's gopro and mat inside a Bugatti
The title is wrong it should be 300 kph
Youtube is promoting porsche ads
This has 0-300 in 14s  Record car had 10s
6:50 thats SIXTEEN hundred not six hundred :)
That a concorde car 🤩🤩
This car shifts to second when doing 100. I shift my Polo to second doing 10-15. Dude!
Mat lost his virginity to this Bugatti
imagine the face mat would have is they could go the full 300 mph
Like the vent nod to the 110 SS.
1 minute late ff
They used 1600 horsepower but he said 600
The happiest man in the world
Can you take it for drag racing?
Wtf man. You joking . You are the last . In Germany everyday someone drives 300kmh 😂😂😅🤣🤣 do research . Check autotopNL
You deserved this
fAastest car?? lol
now Really WOW.... !! Love to see Matt's Smile
Mat: I'm the FIRST to go in the 300mph ...  Hammond: *laughs in british*
How much can i save on this car from carwow??? 😂😂
I think you meant W16 Mat
Lucky you 😎
Drag race it against a Yaris
This is my world favorite car.
👌👌👌❤️❤️❤️👍👍
These cables behind the back window look like some room plants, very nice!
Dziękujemy za udostępnienie tego wypasa!
and the stick of truth????
Happy it wasn't shmee
Mat, it's not the fastest car ever , still JESKO 😘😂
Ohhhhhh My Godddddd Bugatti....
*baited and I'm not mad*
German Gang
It is 300 km/hr not m/hr
Well Matt how much can I save on it,if I buy it through carwow??
Only a car can make a grown man laugh like this!
Finally a buggati review
Like if they have to put these into production too.
7085 max rpm not 7000?
Get in touch with Christian Von Koenigsegg...he may even lent you a car for a whole week....He is not like a Shchumck Bugatti engineer...who wont let you touch a car....🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🤕🤕🤕🤕🤕🤕
love the video
No *Carwow Stick of Truth* allowed.
300 mph or 300 kph?
Sooo... How much we can save on buying bugatti using your website?😂
Hlo mat
5:10 that laugh is iconic
At last I got  my wish fulfilled  by carwow
Christian sounds almost robotic with limited sense of humour. Mat’s like an annoying kid that would touch everything.😂
Disappointed that Matt didn’t poke this car with the stick of truth 😔
I would like you to do a drag race of the Golf 8 gti ajd other hot hatches
Chiron SS and Matt makes it more exciting
0:34 so we gonna ignore those triceps 😏
can I save €2m on the carwow site?
Engineers: How are going to make this car go 300 mph? Designers: Let's put two huge flower pots on the engine. Engineers: That is the most ridiculous idea ever. Testers: 3:31. It actually works guys.
This dog can drive a car!!!!
I've always wanted you to do a review of the Bugatti chiron nice job
But are the exhaust pipes fake tho??
splendid!! you say w12.hahaha
The last time I was this early carwow had a different intro
Cant wait for the Tesla Roadster race against this
Why are you said w12???? There is w16 actualy!!!!!!!
But the real question is how much I can save on the purchase of this Bugatti with the carwow comparison. 😁
I would actually like the review of the Yaris GRMN more because i cant even afford this car
Yeah that’s all well and good, but the question everyone wants to know is how much will we save on a Bugatti Chiron through carwow?
Need likes
No carwow stick of truth ? Lol
bro its W16 isnt it ??  or W12 as u told in the video ??
This dog can drive a car!!!!
Massive congratulations to Matt and everyone at Carwow. Been watching carbuyer with Matt since my early teen years and now look where they are. Proves what hard work can get you
You can save up to an average of £200000 on this chiron through carwow.co.uk
Actually Matt made 2mistakes 1 is that he said the engine was W12 and the other is that the fastest time he recorded was in the Porsche 911s.
How did you get to do that
Plot twist: It is his car
This dog can drive a car!!!!
BUGATTI CHIRON SUPER SPORT :O FIRST ONE TO DRIVE!!!
Swap you for my focus
We need this to up against the turbo s
I feel honoured to be one of the first viewers of a viral becoming video
This dog can drive a car!!!!
BLOODY HELL!!!!!😂
Ahahahaaa I can’t believe they let you how??? 🤣🤣
0-60 time?
4:57 What about the new 911 turbo s?
This dog can drive a car!!!!
The driver is so stereotypically German
im so happy mat actually got this chance, you deserved it mate
300km/h not 300mph.
I’m proud of you Mat
This dog can drive a car!!!!
Bro that car is freaking fast.
how many can we save on this car by carwow??
This dog can drive a car!!!!
Matt I am so damn jealous.
definitely not 300 mph lol
This Bugatti Chiron is noting against the The new Tesla roadster  Bugatti Chiron : 3.5 Million car And has 1600 HP 1500 NM   Tesla Roadster : 200 000 car and NM 10,000 and HP 1000 Which is better ?
This dog can drive a car!!!!
from the Dacia reviews to this.. Congrats Mat!!!
1:37 W12? 🤫
This dog can drive a car!!!!
1:38 "it has a W12" Nah,it is not
Woah what a beast!!!lol Matt couldn't drive it 😂
W12?  No wonder they didn’t let him drive it!!  It’s. W16 you numpty.  No customer paying £3.5m will be happy with an engine from a Phaeton...
This dog can drive a car!!!!
Matt: For weight distribution Engineer: Yeah off course
Hey Mat, where's the carwow "how much money you can save" intro for this video. Don't the people who would actually buy a Bugatti need to compare the dealers and find out how much they can save!
I saw the turbo lag and how it kicked in did u notice it too?
Wer das liked bekommt einen Bugatti Chiron evt.
This test mule is well used. The bodywork looks like a warzone for bugs
Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut: ”Hold my beer”
This dog can drive a car!!!!

This dog can drive a car!!!!
The first? You sure about that Mat?
Like: japanese cars  Comment: german cars Skip: Volvo
why are you liking this comment?
Saying cool is cool 😎
W12 😂 this ain’t no Bentley
This dog can drive a car!!!!
dude this goes from 200-250 like my audi goes from 20-40
Matt: What is the maximum speed? Engineer: Yes
This post is gonna blow up, you heard it here first!!!
The exhaust kind of feel after thought to me, they dont fit properly with the rear end like the normal chiron
There is a faster car but it can’t ride on the road cuz it has a plane motor on his back
So liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
6:12 Bless you
Morning mat
That’s 300kmh not 300mph. Please change your title it’s a little misleading.
It’s a W16 mat !!
“It’s my first Bugatti”  0-300 real quick
Laughs in a Jesko Absolut  😂😂
its like mat is driving with his parent. what a cool guy.
This video will reach 10M views soon. Like if you agree    l  l  l V
Early:)
Its W16 Matt....!!
The most deserving man to ride in this car is Matt
Love how at 5:28 the wing just pops up and blocks the whole window
Matt just moved up a bit on my book
This is extremely cool. Can you guys review the ford Explorer ST?
1:34 W12?
He said 614 HP when it was 1614 HP
It's been 25 minutes since I've watched it and it still says 7 minutes ago
Mat it's no more the fastest jesko Absolut and even the Gemera have more power baby oh my God matt did you just say W12 you're becoming like Yianny doesn't know performance stats of cars he drag races
Quite Ostentatious for a collector to buy this Supercar, change the name to Turbocar!
You deserve it man
Wow
Hey in first 350🤗😄
Now that's called a lit video Matt 💥🌋     Read more
Drag it with the 720
finally took my advice
The fastest car in the world is a devel sixteen
500 mph 🔥🔥!
Waited all day for this upload 😂😂😂
300 mph? Shouldn't it be 300 kph?
BUGATTI VS KOENIGSEGG IS COMING CLOSER
Take the keys!
I am a giant fan of Bugatti, love it
Disappointed you didn’t get a ‘stick of truth’ on those vents 😂
Incroyable 🛣
It has a W16 engine, not a W12. Slight mistake there Matt but still an amazing video. Keep it up!
Matt did not mention how much we could save on Carwow buying this? Not much, is it?
OMG CHIRON 😱🙀🤯🙀😱
5:08 turbos kick in
Why are there what looks like 2 boxes of old cables and plugs in the rear view windows?
The only car that screams 'MONSTER'
Christian Von Koenigsegg : Hold my Jesko.
Who else thought its clickbait
Danm Mat, what an unbelievable experience that must be.
300 km/h not mp/h!
300 km/h not mph
I hate the how normal Chiron looks but this one is sick.
Wtf 1600 hp!
wow 日本語が楽しみ
Not a fan of the matte black. Boring.
I can smell now we can see a drag race of chirron and 720s
Ah Mat It's a W16! 😂
Wow
It's an W16 engine ^^
How much money can I save on this if I buy from carwow?
1.36 its not a w12 its a w 16
How much off do I get with the CarWow app?
That guy seems pissed at mat(who isn't)
W16 Matthew
Can anyone see the plants sitting in the engine bay?
Huh I haven’t seen him with a mask before
If there is no stick of truth it is not a valid review. Try again Mat.
This car looks slow/
How much can I save through carwow.co.uk?
Yay mat is on the floor
Hope you had a great time mat😀😁
Me: Bored Matt: Bugatti chiron Me: WOW Matt: Can't drive it Me: Crying

Supercar Blondie must be fuming 🤣 😂
Matt we made it🎉🎉💃💃💃💥
Just get the car unrestricted, it's the reason people buy the car... "worlds fastest car"
This is my dream car
W12 ?????!?!!!?!! Someone's been doing too many Bentley reviews..
Ah , another car I can only afford in video games  😂😂
Bugatti, my 2nd crush😍😍😍😍
I was just watching videos abt this car!!!
Did you not poke it with a stick ?? RIP Carwow stick if truth You will be missed
Take a shot everytime Mat says 'isn't it' Love you Mat!
Carwow in the big leagues now
From a 2004 Subaru to a Bugatti Chiron. Mat has made it lol
Wait how will I buy a car from carwow if I'm in South Africa?
Please please race Porsche GT2 Rs vs McLaren 720s vs Ferrari 488 pista vs Lamborghini SVJ on Friday.
New car for Manny Khoshbins car collection?
Still more interested in buying new Toyota Yaris :/
@carwow The engine's a W16 not a W12!
Isn’t there w16?
Spoiler:  bugatti's engineer is the first man😂😂😂
God loves you
W16 this ain’t a Bentley Mat 🤣🤣
I’m so proud of u mat! 👍🏻
That crazy
Wow
Love the Bugatti plants placed in the rear window.
Yep yep awesome
1:33 mat said a W12 engine 🤦‍♂️!!!!!
Please drag race with it
Your driver replies like a *robot*
A long time ago I was making fun of how he can’t drive the Bugatti Chiron or review one but I was wrong...
DAMM! am just 3.5€ million short
Those are some very german answers
Omg! This channel is amazing!  And he is the best person and exactly the right person for this. They are very lucky to have him with them!
No road car has ever hit 300 mph, let us know when this car does it, then you can talk. Until then it’s just marketing BS. 300 kph is only 200 mph, anybody can do that on a stock $12,000 Japanese Sport bike.
I was going to buy one but I don't fancy the cup holders🤷🏿‍♂️
Wooaaaahhh
DRAG RACE!!:- This vs the 1900 hp NISSAN PATROL that came in the GRAND TOUR!
Batmobile confirmed
Lucky bastard. Loving the content🙏
1:34 it's W16 engine mat lol🤣🤣
So how much can I save on a Bugatti from carwow?
