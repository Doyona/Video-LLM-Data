Thank you Sir you have put right over wrong.  And have shown the same concern and courage that a Country legend Johnny Cash used to speak out against. You are a Great example of that lineage.
😂❤
OMG. NOBODY'S LISTENING TO YOUR COMPLAINING😂. ZIP IT
It's was supposed to. No body but your
Does anyone else hear Don Williams' Tulsa Time in this song? The least Blake could have done would've been to acknowledge it.
I can't quit laughing, I don't drink.... But I don't have a license to drive a man home either.
Beautiful song! Thank you so much, Blake! ❤👍👏👏👏🤗
Next time Blake Shelton should bring back the cowboy hat.

And I don't know how much longer I'm gonna have my precious baby... And he gets so excited for this song... So I changed a few of the words just for his sake. You got a dog... I know you'll understand... Here it is... NO DOGGIE...  I DONT WANNA SCOOT THE BOOTS WITH NO DOGGIE, CUDDLE UP AT NIGHT WITH NO DOGGIE, WRAP THESE ARMS AROUND NO DOGGIE, NO DOGGIE BUT YOU... DONT WANNA SHADOW DANCE WITH NO DOGGIE, GET DRUG AROUND THE BLOCK BY NO DOGGIE,. DONT WANNA WAKE UP KISSIN NO DOGGIE, NO DOGGIE BUT YOU  DONT WANNA HOLD NO DOGGIE, LAY EYES ON NO DOGGIE, DONT WANNA LOVE NO DOGGIE,   REPEAT CHORUS  DONT WANNA WAKE UP KISSIN NO DOGGIE, NO DOGGIE BUT YOU....  HOPPER JUST LIGHTS UP WHEN I SING THIS TO HIM...  THANKS BLAKE! FEEL FREE TO SING IT TO YOUR DOGGIE TOO!

My new favorite song by Blake! Been a fan for a long time. Saw him in concert at the Marshfield Fair in Wisconsin back in 2007 or 2008...can't quite remember which. But he was amazing then, and he's gotten even better with time! Keep on cranking out that amazing music! Love it!
Luke said would ask. But no ans I deserve truth from people I trust
Love this song can u ask trace why he just dumped me after love 2 yrs want love. Like u and gwen

Great Song & great presentation.... BUT, tell your buddies, that sing Country RAPP Crap, if they are trying to kill Country Music, they will kill their action too....  Your Cheatin' Heart & Murder on Music Row, will be played forever, but today's # 1 tune won't heard again , EVER....

I Truely Wished That My Son Steven Doty Loved Me As Much That I've Always Have Loved Him
I don't know how it's even possible, but country music can make me kinda nostalgic for a world I've never been and never seen. It calms down and gives a feeling of infinity of time as if our life is not so short at all. It gives me meaning and desire to keep living through this difficult time
Kesini gara2 si vidi bilang blake shelton, katanya suara adit mirip blake shelton
ONE OF BEST SONG THAT BLAKE SHELTON EVER WROTE ABOUT NOT BODY BUT YOURS

WHAT A GIFT GOD GAVE YOU !!!  Not only an AWESOME Country Artist ….doubled up with song writing !!! Your sense of HUMOR ROCKS TOO !  YOU ARE TRULY BLESSED  You paid your dues to get where you are.  Most people do not realize the tough road to stardom.. well maybe a handful got a early break, but most musicians live in the road and it’s not an easy one.  I’m not a musician just experienced the road a few times.  I was going thru some papers when l moved and l came across a pamphlet from The Jasper Rodeo in Jasper , Texas and l couldn’t believe my eyes that you played there for Jasper is a one horse town and Yes you were sporting your mullet !  LOL 😂😂 STILL A VERY HANDSOME MAN WHO HAS A VERY BEAUTIFUL WIFE. She is a lucky lady and you are a lucky man that you two found each other. Keep writing great songs and BEING THE BEST  !!! I’m a DEDICATED FAN !!!   UNFORTUNATELY, l have never been able to see you live .  MOST DEFINITELY ON MY BUCKET LIST !!!  I do not think you hit Houston and surely not Beaumont , Texas  Where l am local to.  One day l will see you in concert .   Many thanks for touching lives with your talent  Vicki Ford
Love this Blake! Waiting to see what you bring to country next!! No retirement,  country needs you!
Beautiful

That band is amazing.
Blake at his best!!!!!  Love this.
He admits sniffing cocaine in this song off of Gwen. "Slide some cotton off of no body". That's pretty ballsy.  But this is actually why he got FIRED from The Voice. He is a Drunken Drug addicted PIECE of SHIT. And he sucked Gwen into his SHITTY life.
Why does this sound like ocean man kinda 😭

good evening, I would like to present this dance created by the group of Blake dancers in France during a competition so that it can be taught by country line dance leaders, to do so I must present a step sheet, I can't find it, could you please tell me where to get it? Thanking you very much, I already really like this title by Blake and I find the choreography sparkling and fun
Mr No Body But You ?
You're an  awesome country singer .I am happy you chose to be a country singer. 😊
Love love this❤❤❤❤❤
Mr blake????? So i have a story for you. That in all your year on the voice you never got to hear. Ive heard so many just like you. But i promise you that you would have never heard one like the one i wanna share. I wish there was a way i could just speak with you on the phone. Or even in text blakes last year would be sooo heart wrenching. And maybe even change your mind. We are a karoake and musical family. We have soooo many singers in our family. One of which was murdered in 2008. Ive watched the voice many many years. I have a lot of empathy and sympathy for many who have been where i am. Ive always said. That..... When you think that you have such a bad life. Take a look around ...often you find many who have it much worse then you.  I just want people to know, DONT WASTE WHAT GOD GAVE YOU.i cant sing. But i love to.  How do i enter someone into the contestants??? I know sooo many!!!❤
One of his worst songs in a while
For as long as you been sharing your musical talent ..  Good medicine!
Your music grows with you . Your fans love that voice and the person it represents .
Love all your music Blake. You are true country. Hope to see you at NHMS race in July.
I love this song that such a good get up and go and make you feel Good the man isso 🎉🎉😅😅 handsome he can sing any song a😊 I love listening to him saying and talk he's funny he makes you just feel good that's the way I let someone feel good the way you made you feel he is a wonderful place

Your music brought my husband and I together and your songs touch our hearts in so many ways and you and Gwen’s music together is WOW! Nobody but You is our song because that’s word for word how we fell in love and after 17 years together that song is our song today, it’s AMAZING!!!! When we renew our vows soon, that will be the one we play!!!! This one is OUR FAVORITE DANCING SONG now! ❤ After the mushy LOVE SONG as my Hubby describes, we will go from Nobody but You to scooting the boots 👢🎉❤

Cool song Blake. Great for boot scootin.
Hi Blake Shelton I love your music video it sounds awesome 👌 and amazing 👏 to 👍
❤❤❤.. favorite new song
Oh, my.  This is so good.  Have it on repeat.  Love the line dancing, Mullet and the old country sound.  What a fun song!!!  Wish we could hear more music like this.  Get you up and dance!  So clever!
I like only rap music pretty much. But I find myself singing this and You Proof by Morgan Wallen 😅
Lord, I have missed the way Blake looked with his hat n mullet- look curly long locks! When he came out with Red, my favorite all time by him! Oh, and the mullet IS REAL here! Yaayyy! ❤
I'm in Love with Nobody! Nobody but Yours!
All your songs are great & this one is especially is the best one yet!

Lyric clarification…does rodong on the back of moons Harley refer to what I’m thinking you raving cowpokes are thinking…just trying to see through all the tangled wires and words, never mind then thought s???? Tell me NOW!!!
Awesome video & song!♥️🌟👋
Yall forgot about this side of Blake....
nomination worthy!!
Nobody but you
I love Blake so much that every song he wrote and recorded throughout his career I love them all  Go Blake Shelton 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Please keep it country
muito bom
OK, WAIT...lol...I LOVE the throwback look for this video! wow
Oh Gawd! Blake Shelton got more unattractive than he already was! His song mentions the word 'no' too many times. It then combines that word with 'body.' He saws no body can make him whatever. I am part of the BODY of Christ. What is Blake? A part of Gwen S. and her body. Her body is not known to the Body of Christ. Thus, Blake Shelton is a bomb!
your videos are so good..
Con los aegentinos hay  un detalle los japoneses  aman el TANGO. y yo no. Yo amo la MUSICA COUNTRY.  QUÉ  CRAZY NO???
Guys Blake got nominated for video of the year on the cmas make sure to vote for him
❤love the song, video but most of all you got your mullet back! 😂❤

I just love this new song and I just hope he sings it Friday night march 10 in Columbus Ohio at the concert I will be there at. See you Blake tollison Shelton 💕
My very favorite cowboy/singer. Love you Blake.
I love love love this song
As soon as I heard this on the radio I knew it was my Blake...nobody has a voice like his! And it is an instant hit OF COURSE!!
Back with the good ole mullet and line dancing days. No racism everyone just having fun like it should be.
My favorite song from Blake Shelton
I want Blake to preform this song in a bar scene on Yellowstone. I so love this series and Blake’s video with this song. Help me push this into a reality.  I’m soon to be 84 so time is important.
Conheci a música country por um amigo meu americano que me apresentou, então apresentei a ele o nosso sertanejo do Brasil que é o mesmo ritmo, hoje ele está viciado no nosso sertanejo e eu na música country. 🇧🇷🇺🇸❤️

Happy friday afternoon! Mexico is listening Blake!
😚😉🤗😎
😇😅🤣😂🤗😎
Hello my friends
Top Gun Maverick proved that people still like a good practical effects action movie. Songs like this prove that we still love a good more traditional sounding modern country song. Thanks for that, Blake. I've been listening to country for 42 years, now... I know a good song when I hear it. And this is one of the good ones.
i love this song
I love this song so much it is my favorite we act like we r having a party Ty from jamming and I’ll see u on the voice Blake.
Dam right Blake you it I just gotta find me somebody watch out for b g I heard he has a dusty plane with 100 gallon of green paint love brother heads up I hope you don't have to sing some beach ⛱️
Needs to bring the mullet back for real!! Music seems better when he wears a mullet 🤣
My legs move automatically 🔥 just magic in his voice and beat is good too
I wrote these lyrics down word for word and mailed them to my husband during his incarceration and felt each word I wrote!!!  It was as  if I’d written it to him myself!! Thank you Luke; for putting out such a beautiful song  Needless to say my husband is home now and all charges were dropped but I knew from the second I heard this song it was ours!!!!
You are a great singer I love your music Kenny Chesney fan Jamesina vest
Yeah I would love to meet you someday Blake Shelton
Is no one realizing that he gets hit at the end by a pickle?
No Body But YOU !~!~!~
Oklahoma should be proud that we have a native like Blake Shelton. Awesome country songwriter and singer, always bringin a new hit. God bless you Blake Shelton you da man! 💯
I absolutely love this song 🎵! First time hearing it on kiss 💋 country radio in my car was at 8am...I'm driving down the road just dropped kids off at school and this song 🎵 comes on and I just wanted to pull over on the side of the road at the gas station and turn up the volume on my radio 📻 and blast 🎶 this song and start Line Dancing 💃 it brings out the country girl 👢 in me and it puts me in a great smiling 😃 mood every time I hear it. Its a catchy song 🎵 and I don't see how anyone could not. It just brings me alive!  Amazing song!
1st was great!!!! I totally agree!!!!
Love the song, hate the video
Thank you Blake! Great song!
This is sooooo old school Country - love it!  He makes me laugh with some of his lyrics.
Great voice but crap songs. Blake; go get Beck to help you out. He's so far ahead of you in songwriting it aint funny. Might actually bring into the 21st Century. Enough of the corn syrup cowboy facade.
Blake you're hot!!!
Really like this new version of blake
KISS FROM FRANCE !!!! 🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵 I LOVE YOUR VOICE !!! 💖💖💖💖 THE VOICE OF GOD !!!! 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼

Man I really like your song
This song is one of my favorites Blake Shelton
Sir Blake Shelton can I have your cowboy hat for my birthday ☺️🥺
Awsome tune!
LOVE the song Blake! 🎵 very good vibe and sound ☺️ the end gets me everytime bc I can just see Gwen on set and throwing that 🤣 cute couple! But definitely a song I play alot to get in a good mood .😌
Thought I was back in the 90s w his long hair!  Go Blake!!!  LOL
He's got!!!
Catchy Tune + Perfect vocals = great song
Who was the guy the Guy on the Motorcycle, at the beginning of the Video? Looks like the dude from Old Dominion?!? Thank you, love the Vid!!!!
Can't believe it's actually a video without Gwen.
Blake Shelton you have made another song that I couldn’t stop listening to while watching my 9 year old niece learning how to skate at the local Star Skate.
Awesome song
Happy Anniversary to the real  Blake Shelton to the real Christina Aguilera for the past 29 years!
If you don’t do it, Nime swish, your giving Satan an opportunity. Sex with a covenant partner will keep you out of trouble. John once told me he works to stay out of trouble. I gave him a kiss goodbye, walked up my walk with a little swag. Just trying to keep him out of jail!!!
Let’s just keep this song on repeat. How we gonna pop the population with righteous generations. More sex Ed anyone????
Ho many times did I tell John that passion will drive you home. It’s Hod given!!! I know!!! The delight of the Holy Covenant of God!!! Sweet pomegranate bubbly wine anyone. Let’s just get the new wine flowing. Would someone pop the. Cork????
It takes two to tangle…..tango????
Does Mother Mary need to have a sex Ed class? Maybe writs a song about Ed the talking horse. Pretty girls are saying shut the ______ up and kiss me!!!
Why does a momma kiss an ouchy????
Love from 🇮🇳 India
This guy pretty good, he might win on the voice.
Bring back the mullet

Great song Blake your amazing artist glad I saw you in concert it was awesome
Yes it looks like what’s her name made him change his music for the Better…
Twenty year olds a older man's must have older forties women beeare

Younger woman alert.. older man is this a good combo
So good! Such good vibes with your hunny.
Sounds like the Old Blake Shelton ❤❤
Wow he looks alot like toby Keith in this video. My mom goes Gaga over toby so now I can over blake
This whole time I thought he was saying “don’t want to scoot the bootch with nobody”. Looked up the lyrics to get the spelling of bootch so I could find out what a bootch is.  SMH boots. Not Bootch lol
Funny story too tell about this song. Came on in car and hubby responds questioning the lyrics. What is the man singing, don't want to scoot the pooch with nobody. Makes no sense he says. I nearly died laughing when I responded with what the lyrics really were, don't want to scoot the boots with nobody. Dead stare, and responds oh.
Black  is my favorite  singer
First time hearing it was on the radio and I missed most of the song but I came here and I’m stuck 🥰🥰
Love this man's song great dance song
Woohoo!! No Body but You!    🔥😘❤🎶🎵😋😉🤘💃💃

Awesome new song makes me wanna 2 step 👍😃
jes,jes jes hammer topp
Good song. I like the VHS quality in the beginning, nice touch of the 90s. Mullet too. But the song needs a solo, e.g. guitar followed by fiddles and maybe even keyboard. The ending could be more distinct.
0:23,
Sexy’s Man Alive that’s our Blake
Blake Shelton music keeps staying awesome, he's the best country singer ever, I'm always a Blake Shelton fan no matter what, I keep listening to his music from 2017-2022, now I'm listening to his music in 2023
Hey Blake, I wrote a song for you! Hope you sing it.   Verse 1: I woke up this morning, got dressed in my boots Headed out to the kitchen, expecting to see my little ole' gal cooking up some eggs and fruit But the stove was cold, the coffee pot was dry And the only thing I found was a note that read "goodbye" Chorus: But it's alright, it's okay I've still got a six pack, a couple of friends, and a Saturday So I'll just sit here and drink my beer Cause at the end of the day, it's just me, the dog, and my guitar here Verse 2: She took off with the truck, the dog, and the trailer too I guess she had enough of my two-timing, whiskey-drinking ways, ain't that the truth But I can't say I blame her, I've done her wrong But she left me with a broken heart and a country song Chorus: But it's alright, it's okay I've still got a six pack, a couple of friends, and a Saturday So I'll just sit here and drink my beer Cause at the end of the day, it's just me, the dog, and my guitar here Bridge: I'll find myself a new love, someone who won't leave But until then, I'll keep living life my way, free as a bird, wild as a bee I'll keep singing these sad songs, pouring out my heart Cause at the end of the day, it's just me, the dog, and my guitar, tearing me apart Chorus: But it's alright, it's okay I've still got a six pack, a couple of friends, and a Saturday So I'll just sit here and drink my beer Cause at the end of the day, it's just me, the dog, and my guitar here
I love this song good jam ❤
Such a great song
Let’s roll
I love me some Blake

🤘🥰🤪😜😉🔥🥵❤🎵🎶🍾🍹🍹🍾🎵🎶
Heck of a good song. I am going to need to rename my playlist to Blake Shelton🙋🏼‍♀️🥰

Don’t wanna scoot the boots with No Body
Such a great song ! What a vibes 🤼‍♀️ Love Blake Shelton 😍 hugs from Italy.
Love love this song and Blake .
Such a stupid stupid song. He was probably thinking, how many times can I sing the word "nobody" and write small lyrics around it. Like I said such a stupid stupid song. He repeats the word "nobody" probably 20 times or more in one lousy ass song! Learn how to write a damn song!
Great song. The shorts that the women are wearing are inappropriate
I adore this and it’s how I feel about my man!
Was that a slice of watermelon that hit him on the head at the end?😂
❤️
Karen Waldrop
Sharing always
It’s an awesome line dancing song I’d dance too
Man I love 90s country and Blakey poo! Only he could pull this off. This is the best two step jam ever. My wife and I are two stepping and loving it. Thank you Mr Shelton for bringing us great music as always! Love it!

I think he owes the Don Williams estate some money . Sounds like Tulsa Time
That’s a wig and this sounds too much like Tulsa Time. Nice Try though.
Please get yer Mullet back, I didn't think you could ever look better! ... I have every single CD of yours! You may not believe this Blake, you saved my life back in 2013!
The song was Let your Love Shine by The Bellamy Brothers. See a law suit coming!

Hi how long u been a Fan of mine?
Bringing back the Mullet
BLAKE proposed to Gwen the same exact day my hubby did to me and we didn't find out till the next morning we heard it on the XM channel! So we joke how we are Blake and Gwen. We married in Feb. of 2021. My son in law asked him if him and Blake got together to arrange the proposal. LOL This is my 3rd marriage and his 2nd. Hopefully the last for both of us and for Blake and Gwen God bless you both for sharing your gift of music and making our lives so much more happier. Our wedding song was God Gave Me You. WE can't wait for the March 17 concert. I'm a teacher and off the whole week. We are pulling our camper from South Padre Island, Texas to Oklahoma City. Have y'all checked him out on the hunting channel? He's so down to earth. Peace to everyone reading this.  Brian & Berlinda

Mullet!
Well God damn! What a  great song! You all ways keeping coming.
Well God damn great song!
Oh gods, the mullet. I was one of those girls back then. And I loved mullets.
that cant be his real hair of Blake
Like everyone else has said, I love the original look, mullet and black cowboy hat. Swoon! 😍
First Song and music Video in over 15 Years that has given me FAITH that Country will gradually or overnight get back to it's roots. I was born in 79. 90s and 2000s country is my era. I was oblivious to how country sounded like actual Country back then. (Fiddles, steal guitars, harmonizing with twangy accents) Around the same time F/G line was starting to get big, is when I stopped listening to Country... Cold Turkey. It was how Blake was dressed that made me click on this video. It's been out for 2 months and I'm hearing it for the first time.
Missed this country
That biker ran super quick inside
kudos🥍
אבא? מה אתה עושה פה?
Joker.
Country Music saves my life👍
Love his songs and sense of humor!  Go Blake......great song

Seen you in your friends talk show with Gwen and Gigi Hadid ‼️You n him are hilarious together never disappoint on there🤣 I don't want you to leave The Voice 💥you are the only reason I watch. Love you and Gwen❤️❤️‼️
Blake is so funny he's as good as the best and better than the rest another number one hit he likes to scoot his boots with no  body 😂
I don't know how I just found out about this song now, but I love it.
Nostalgia! Just like the country I grew up with.
I just seen Blake on Fallon, I just get so tickled at him, Gwen you haft to laugh at him when you don't want to. Me and my son love his music. I'm close to Knoxville, Tenn. I might get to go to his concert. PS, if you quit the VOICE, I will not watch it anymore, you made the show and we all know it, so make movies ok cause that's the only way for us to see you. Good Luck what ever you do. 😭

😎😎  Lauren Alaina is way way too~u^gly~ and gross to be part of any collaboration.  That's why she can't find anyone to sing with.  Nobody wants to be seen with her or sing with her in public, because she sings like a loser and looks like a fool.  She has a pathetic low life.  Kane Brown is the only person whom she can depend on, but his music career is falling apart too because of his pathetic, amateur, lousy performances at CMA awards.   He's not gonna last very long in music business either.   "Kane Brown and Khalid can't sing is an understatement".  They both sound like street singers begging for spare change in the street.  Fire him
Love the country word Play! Fuck yeah! 💯
Am I seriously the only one that noticed that his mullet is back?!
Anybody know when the next Season of The Voice starts?
Oh Nevermind. I got it
This a new song? Or older?
Omg I love this bar I live down the street ❤
80s and 90s country music way it's meant to be
Country fu..k gone kane brown and lucke blake so called country can stop calling themselves county because nothing they but out is real country especially kane brown
I only know blake since his if I'm honest album and I love this one
Cowboy Country!!
Good song I like it
Hey Blake Shelton why did you put getting hit from a water melon to get hit in the face at the end!?!?
Damn Blake got his mop head back? Gota say when he lost the hair the country went with it It might of been lambert bring him down but whatever the reason was he sucked with  the short cut  We need the long haired blake
I love you,Blake!
Yep he lookd good with the long hair thee original Blake made him look more country Gwen she's a city slider shell never look country wears to much makeup don't look country
FABULOUS AGAIN ☺️😘

I’m thinking I’m grow my hair out and get my mullet back
Wow ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Thank you Blake for keeping real country music alive!
How can one person be sooo perfect  in everything? Yeah,Blake  you got it all!  Love ya!
Haha!  Love the ending! 🤣🍉

Heeeyyyy Mr. Shelton!!! 😁 My oldest boy told me today they heard from their mother that you were spotted in LaGrande OR!!! 😯 Well dang that's only 55 mi from my family ranch. Come by and have a cold one ya get the time 😉... take care, God bless 😁💪✝️❤️🌞😎

This is as good as the twist back in the sixty, even disco in eighty. Wild time flies when you have good music 💜
This needs to be #1
Melodious hit indeed👌
I would give almost anything to meet, and sing with you!!!
He looks like allen jackson!!
I love that new song
What do I do
Where should I go
♥️🥰😞🥰❤️😍😘😘🤴🏽🎶🎵
Gwen Stefani looks like Joan Rivers now :(. hopefully. Blake won't leave her for a younger woman.
"When I die I wanna come back as a country boy"  Imagine instead you come back as a city boy in the middle of Brooklyn New York! 🤠😰🤮
Looks like Gwen Stefani is doing the same thing to Blake Shelton that Megan Fox did to Machine Gun Kelly
There you go blake. Nice country song that I can relate too.
Freakin awesome!!!! ❤
Blake Shelton ❤❤❤
The video is available in 2160p 4K but looks better at 480p... who'da thought?  Sounds good though at volume 10!
Hope this helps bring back the sound from the 90's, the hair styles and jeans that fit the guys right. A revolution of true country music.
🐐
Makes me remember why I once loved country. Todays country doesn’t have the same feel. Thanks for taking me back to my boot scooting. Honky tonking. Texas dance hall days!
love this song but then i love all your songs

Dixie cup martinis Second one's a freebie Happy Friday afternoon That neon sun's rising I'm sitting here admiring The summer dress it's shining through Had just enough to tell you the truth Don't wanna scoot the boots with nobody Get straight tequila drunk on nobody Wrap these arms around nobody No body, but yours Don't wanna shadows dance with nobody Slide some cotton off of nobody Don't wanna wake up kissing nobody No body, but yours Honeysuckle talking Last call on me walking Out there to a checkered cab B-line to your condo Conway on the stereo Girl, I'd love to lay you down, down, down Don't wanna scoot the boots with nobody Get straight tequila drunk on nobody Wrap these arms around nobody No body, but yours Don't wanna shadows dance with nobody Slide some cotton off of nobody Don't wanna wake up kissing nobody No body, but yours Don't wanna hold nobody Lay eyes on nobody Love up on nobody Don't wanna scoot the boots with nobody Get straight tequila drunk on nobody Wrap these arms around nobody No body, but yours Don't wanna shadows dance with nobody Slide some cotton off of nobody Don't wanna wake up kissing nobody No body, but yours Don't wanna wake up kissing nobody No body, but yours
I like this song LOVE me some BLAKEY 😂but what’s with him saying yooool ? He doesn’t pronounce like that in any other song 🫤😂😂😂
Glad he grew his hair back out Looks better long imo
Love you and love your new song🤩😘
Is that a bunch of bananas being thrown at his face at the end? Hilarious!  I love this song, the look, the dancing, and the funny parts so much, I watch it at least 2 times a day. I am currently learning the dance moves.😅🤣😂
Awesome… love it

Friggin' LUV this song..the beat is unbelievable but then again it's Blake.  Gwen...you r one heck of a lucky woman!  Absolutely luv u two together!
Good job Blake.
Always a hit coming from the country genre  protector. The dance move, the lyrics, the hype.... Just too easy to catch and so influencing.  Love from India Blake Shelton.
🌹🔥❤️🎵🎆✌️
Hell to the yea get it boy
I love this song you good in hat
I love all his songs, line dancing is so fun
I love this song
His long career is a testament to how good he really is.  My favorite song is still Austin.
Reminding us of the 90's music and the vibe ooohh..... Amazing. Blake you never fail to entertain us. ❤️❤️from India
Omg!!! Killed it AGAIN!!! LOOKS HOTTER THAN F WITH THAT HAT AND HAIR!!!! FANTASTIC SONG! EASY TO MEMORIZ THIS ONE!!
As good as always!!! Love it!
Only missing a blanket of smoke covering the room and I'd be back home in my 20s. Before they killed country
Love Song so fun!
My god!! I hope it didn't take a long time to write this song! Talk about mailing it in! This is the reason country artists are ripping off other genres music. TO SAY THAT THIS IS AWFUL IS GIVING IT CREDIT! Absolutely pathetic SHIT!
Supr hermosa canción su voz es muy linda. APLAUSOS.
Line dancing 💃 wahoo lol
I'm only  18 but i love this gentleman, , this is the real definition of talent.i first listened  to happy anywhere and since then he has been my all time favourite.

So good ,
Pretty good one!!!!! Shendon always comes up with the best
Love the blond look on you @Blake especially with the black embellished jacket and black hat. Love the song too. How much money do I have to spend on I tunes downloading your song to get you to lose 20lbs? Be careful at Indio, CA as it is going to be 113 there.
Listening here from Philippines, i always love your songs 🙂
Tune, love it, words so, so.
Blake reminds me of Tracy Lawrence in the early 90's here 😂 and the guy on the electric guitar has a Kix Brooks shirt on from the (Brooks&Dunn Hard Workin' Man) album 😂
Blake, I really love this new look!! and the song is awesome.
How does anyone listen to this, sounds like something they’d torture me with over in iraq
💁Please...  come back to  # RiverSpirit in the lot! 😘🙋
Why can't I find this song on itunes??
Thats what Im talkin bout Mr. Shelton <3 Keep them comin, awesome music, awesome rhytm, awesome lyrics, awesome clip !   Cheers from middle european blue collar ! :)
Your singing is phenomenal, So you don't want to do the "Boot Scootin Boogie?" 🤣
Absolutely ❤️ love ❤️ this ❤️ song
Need a long island ice tea 💯
Is red still alive?
I love his hairstyles for each video and this one is the best one yet
Allen Jackson watch out!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’m here for the mullet babyyyyy
This’ll be the best country music video of the year!…. Thanks Blake!
Blake  Shelton Is trying to copy Alan Jackson
Love this !❤️
I  picture him singing this to Gwen.  I wonder if she inspired the writing of this song?  I really, really love the line dance, too!
why does this look like it's from the 80's or 90's
My granddaughter loves Blake and this just made her day
❤️🥰♥️😘😍🧸😭🌎
❤️🥰♥️😍🧸😘🌎
Looks good hat a long hair

Blake’s still Country really like this song a dancing song
I love this song, nice job Blake, 👏👏👏👏👏😇
Blake is great, but who was that guy riding the bike at the beginning of the video? He looked so kool. Reminds me of a James Dean or Elvis. Is he an actor or dancer? I saw him dancing in the video. Hope we see more him!
Has anyone heard the wedding song Blake wrote for Gwen? I can’t find it 🤔
Hell yeah bubba
Blake does it again love this!!!
It's not his best.. He's done better
Man, I miss the nineties
I love you, and you can put your boots under my bed anytime!!!!
I want to sing with you, but I realize that that is only a dream, that’s ok….
Amazing 🎵 👍🏻🙏🏻❤️
Love the original look as well! Sounds like great 90's/ early 2000's Country Music! Keep it up Blake! Love you got the hat back on! Real Country is on the rise again finally after 15-20 years of POP AND HIP HOP TRASH!
Blake please bring  your mullet back.
Blake Keep This Look Love This Song He Is Pure Country
I loved the song 😍 but can anybody plz kindly tell me what it means “to slide some cotton off some body”
I should been a cow 🐄 boy I should learn not to copy Toby Keith 1996
We need more of this. That 90s sound needs to make a comeback.  Love it
Doesn't this deserve more views and likes?
Great.
Always entertaining ✨
Yooooo Blake, I'm totally digging the hair man!!! This song's a bop too 👍
It's ok lmao 🤣 not sure what the hype was over lol it's just ok. It would be bad but it's Blake so I won't go that far but it's definitely not one of his best 😉
That's more like it. Maybe we'll get to see more of the old Blake Shelton.
Only our greatest icon Blake could be his greatest song 🎵 that could make you dance 💃  with his stunning looks 🥰😊🤩🤗😍😇🙏💯🌟🔥❤️😃👌👍🙌👏😉💃
Man this song has some great 90s country feel to it, can't wait to spin a girl to this song at the next dance!
Loving the shift back to Blake's original look!!!
Instant classic
I love this song and video Blake has done it again
Blake has done it again 👍 this track is bound to be number 1 on the charts Who else agrees? 🔥
Omg he looks like Alan Jackson🤣 waited too long, he did used to have a beautiful mullet back in the Austin, Ole Red era...👍
Sorry to hear about your motorcycle accident.  Be safe and get back on the horse.

Awesome!  Tequila And Tacos as I listen to this!
So, we're bring back the mullet? Count me in son!
POT FARMER DANCE SONG $ I got out my pipe stuffed it with pot You better believe it held a whole lot. I whipped out a lighter thumbed up a flame Sucked down that smoke which comforts my brain.  I tried alcohol smoked cigarettes They did nothing but give me regrets. My mom had arthritis could not walk around I rolled her a joint she danced on the ground.  I thought I was losing my lovemaking knack  After I smoked some to me it came back. Soon I decided prices were high I searched for some ground I wouldn't have to buy.  I bargained for seeds from smokers all around  Got in my truck and drove out of town. I walked through the woods where wild birds nest  Found me the meadow I thought was the best.  I dug up the ground sowed all my seeds Said a small prayer for strong, healthy weeds. I watered at night with a five-gallon pail  Mosquitoes went hungry for I wore a veil.  Seven months went by; I thought I would die Till the Halloween moon was high in the sky. At night I went out, in a camouflage suit  Used my corn knife to chop down the loot.  I hung it up to dry where it couldn’t be found. Came back and got it, when it had turned brown. I trimmed off the buds, stuffed them in bags Called all my friends and passed out free drags.  In less than a week my crop was gone  I flew to St. Thomas with a love hungry blonde!!  By Kansas City Poet Tom Zart Google = Most Published Poet  Tom’s 1,650 Poems Are Free To Share! Google = George Bush Tom Zart Google = Pot Farmer Poem

WOW, I wonder if he really grew his hair, out, and brought the mullet, back? I wish he'd keep it like that, for awhile!! Plus, he's lost alotta weight---all that farmin', he did, this summer!! I LOVVVE that he's keepin' it, Country!!! ❤️
Blake God  Blessed  You With A Beautiful Voice !! You're  Song is Awesome  !! God Bless  You !!
🤠
I remember when people used to say he had gone Hollywood. I say he used his platform on the Voice to become one of the biggest ambassadors of country music ever.
Did he really grow his hair out and know has a mullet again?
Love Blake’s long hair and his cowboy hat! Love the song and the dancers!
This took me back to the 90's at "Wild Country" in Collinsville, IL!
Love this song and the video
Shouldn't it be "Nobody?"
Blake has lost his sparkle… he’s very talented, but his songs don’t have the same feel as his older songs. Soulless sad
I absolutely love this song!! Old school country!!
90's good old days! Love U Blake!
HE IT'S AT UBC UNION BRAZILIAN COMPOSER
Seems to me, more country artists are slowly starting to make music that sounds like 80's 90's Country!! Keep it Blake, need more of this and less of that country pop crap!!
Sounds like early 90's country. This is country at it's finest.
Blake Shelton is still the king of country
Yay
Good song man
Good in the hat
Beautiful song love it
This is one of the dumbest songs I’ve ever heard.
Took all these years just for Blake Shelton to turn into John Anderson 🥴
🙉💃😅😅👏👏👏👏👏👏...
Wooohoooo! 🤠🤠🤠
З великим задоволенням, завжди слухаю ці гарні блюзи. Супер. Дякую.
Looking like old school Toby Keith!
I understand why they were throwing things at him.  This man is a disgrace to America and he must stop.
Love it Blake❤️
Still pop. If you want that actual classic 90s honky tonk country go listen to midland Mr. Lonley
Country sucks stay off my feed. I all ready had this crap blocked and it keeps popping up.
I love the new song and mv. I grew up in the 90s so this is very satisfying and takes me back to the good time.
Why should you never trust a pig with a secret?      Because it's bound to squeal.
🔥🔥
Love Blake! Love the song! Hate the long hair!
Blake said, "Personally victimize the older millennials*." *nineties kids
Great I'm going to have to watch the second mullet revolution in my lifetime.
Haven't listened to country for a long time, because it's not country anymore. BUT, bless Blake, his music is great. Love this song.
Blake is back!!!!
Yes
Now that’s a pretty faithful song...he don’t want nobody but yorn....I like faithful men.
Should show off that guitar man on the Dabro

OMGGGGG - what a GREAT song and video!!!
NOT YOUR BEST PRODUCT TO DATE, AND I’M NO SONGWRITER, BUT EVEN I KNOW “NOBODY BUT YOU” WOULD SOUND SO MUCH BETTER!😉
What a Great Song! It is Groovy and Stays in your mind After hearing it!  Thank you @Blake for Another awesome Song.😎 Cheers to ya‘ll.

Blake’s “wife” is a man, Gavin was dating Marilyn before and everyone in Hollywood knows
It is time for Blake to come out with something good,  that is to dance to.
THATS A HIT!!!

Great song/video, but I wish it had been Gwen he sat down with at the bar.
Blake is back. He has been busy being a loving husband and father.  Sometimes your priorities change in life. However it's great to see a new song and a new look.
🌈💋🎻
My comment will probably get lost but whoever reads this.. You got this! Whatever you are going through will get better hang in there ✨❤️

I'm sorry,  I have always enjoyed Blake Shelton's music, but I'm not liking this one.  Maybe if I heard it on the radio first I may.  Perhaps it's this video.   Not much Blake Shelton style to me.

Blake Shelton's "No Body" Lyrics:  Dixie cup martinis / Second one's a freebie / Happy Friday afternoon / That neon sun's rising / I'm sitting here admiring / The summer dress it's shining through / Had just enough to tell you the truth  CHORUS: Don’t wanna scoot the boots with nobody / Get straight tequila drunk on nobody / Wrap these arms around no body / No body but yours/ Don’t wanna shadow dance with nobody / Slide some cotton off of nobody / Don’t wanna wake up kissing no body / No body but yours  Honeysuckle talking / Last call Old Milwalking / Out there to a checkered cab / B-line to your condo / Conway on the stereo / Girl, I'd love to lay you down, down, down  REPEAT CHORUS  Don't wanna hold nobody / Lay eyes on nobody / Love up on nobody  REPEAT CHORUS

I Love  the songs, 🥰👏👏👏🇧🇷🇧🇷
People that’s not black that’s my man Toby Keith
Holy Crap!  Clearly, Gwen sweet-talked Blake into letting her give him a "retro make-over" for this.  I gotta say...  she wasn't wrong. He looks Bad Ass. How I'd love to have been there when Trace first saw this!
🤗looking forward to it🎤🎸🤩🤩🤩
Come on Blake!!!!
I guess Blake is identifying as a shahe boi now
Me personally when he sang Conways goodbye time an in my house growing up you didn't mess with a few of ems music but I'll never forget the day pops was in garage an I didn't care I knew what I thought already bout it, but two neighbors the mail man momma n one the paramedics that showed up to revive grandma all of em passed right out from an overwhelming sudden shock to there brain when pops turned around an said that man right there sang that one better than Conway an idk can't recall  what he was bout to  say cause I didn't faint I was running to the living to play goodbye time  by   Blake Shelton an hit repeat then called 911 for family while goodbye time played Loud af for pops to hear it lmao Till now I never thought of how fkn funny that whole scene must have been walking  in seeing room full of ppl out cold good bye time jamming an pops lmao just kept repeatedly Saying his favorite verse lol omg lol
Has to be something done earlier in his career as he looked like this when he started singing .
I love the whole package it all looks good Can't wait to see the video

Not a fan of the mullet. Short his is better. But anyways. I’m excited for some new music. I’m so glad that your taking it back to country music that sounds more like the first few albums you made.  Please let this mean that there is a new album in the works.
Is Blake going back to his roots or something?
