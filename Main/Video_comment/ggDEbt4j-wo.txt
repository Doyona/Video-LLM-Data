Matt Love you too
omg your video is such a therapy, love that
I hope you’re ok Matt. ❤❤❤
Here
i might sound crazy but sometimes out of nowhere i get anxiety attacks, and they’re difficult to deal with. i always coped with them by scratching something fabric really hard, but ever since ive heard you say that you just take deep breaths, it really has helped. thank you matt.
i come back here often
The day that Matt posts is my favourite day!!
I’m proud of you Matthew🫶
My therapist.
Matt we love youu
3:23 I love Matt's energy. It might not be exuberant but it has such a calming effect. Me personally, my mind doesn't ask to be entertained often though I always appreciate some balanced, low stimulating space. I love their chaotic videos, makes my stomach ache from laughing 😭 but I think many Matt girls know what I'm talking about.   Matt is precious to me, he really is.
I’m here in 2025
You help me sm ! ❤
I love you so much my baby matt sturniolo ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love you so much my baby matt sturniolo and I love your videos and I do love you're My first video and I also love you alone my baby matt sturniolo
every single time i feel upset i run here
I’m back here again and in such a bad spot mentally. I really want an in depth explanation of how to deal with overthinking and anxiety attacks because these videos help me every time I’m not in a good spot because I have absolutely no one to talk to or cares. I really hope we get a new video soon (no pressure obviously).
What a cute guy
2025 september anyone??❤❤❤
Love the self awareness 😊
Its so sad when he says hes boring. Matt you are not boring you impact so many lives and we love you ❤❤❤❤❤
17:24 I heard it “subscribe baby “ and I was like WHAT!?

Me 2025
it’s been 3yrs matt..
Hey so I have a Video idea, maby POST. It's been like a while
Guys with a lot of love i'll tell you this. If you're going through sm alone & you feel like your life is a whole big loop that you don't want to live in...Write down these 11 questions and answer them. Seriously, i did it & i'll tell you that you're gonna have a mental breakdown but you'll get your answer on why your life is the way it is & a clear answer on how to change it too  Note: Be honest abt it 1.What do you like about your life rn? 2.What sucks in your life rn? 3.How does what i feel rn makes sense? 4.What am i trying to control when i'm anxious/fear? 5.What "win in life" means to me? 6.What am i holding onto frm the past that is keeping me frm moving forward? 7.What characteristics in other am i attracted to? (This shows who you actually want to be) 8.What limiting beliefs i have of myself? 9.What is most important to me? 10.What changes am i willing to make to create the life i've always wanted? 11.How does a day of my dream life looks like?  The topic of Anxiety should be touched on more because ik many people struggles w it. If you want to share anything(if you feel safe to share) do share below this comment too. You're not alone & you definitely can win this battle ❤
Matt is literally me but male version i'm dead serious. It actually scares me lol 3:21
i always come back to this channel whenever i’m sad
Nobody wished me a happy birthday so I went to Matt and he made my birthday happy
i still come back to this video when i need it.
U WERE ON MY FOR U PAGE ❤❤
❤
5:47  not you don'ttttttt☺️☺️I swear
I love his voice so much❤️
2:44 your doing amazing sweetie (ifykyk)
I got worse and I came back and I’m better
Bro you have big fans in world bro continue to do make video  youtube bro 👍👍💪💪💪
I swear to God i cant go till the end of a anxiety related video because they sound too professional and not relateable but with Matt i honestly feel like i releate a bit too much and it doesnt get boring at all. I just hope Matt realises that he’s not boring and that I love to listen to him expressing himself
5:44 you don’t sound like an idiot. You’re coming off as relatable 6:13 whenever you three of you do clothing halls your fits are usually the best 8:04 FINALLY some Matt answers 14:00 bring back cello Matt🧙‍♂️ 17:03 his brain loading face is so cutsie 17:20 everybody SUBSCRIBE he said it so sweet so I gotta yell at yall
The way that I actually love these videos because when you were talking I always understood what you were saying because of how easy I loose my train of thought to like how you were explaining it I completely understood ❤️
He's so pretty ❤
My anxiety is so bad I had to sit in my school's office for multiple weeks in a row because, I had anxiety attacks right halfway through the day. Once I had a really bad anxiety about something and I froze in the middle of gym class and got hit in the head with a ball❤
Happy birthday Matt❤
Happy birthday Matt
2:01 not the person in the back like walking behind the car lwk scared me
matthew come back 😢
We love clean face Matt ❤
5’8 on a good day 😭
I love when the outro involves some type of screaming (for any one of the Sturniolo's channels lol) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ik it's not likely Matt sees my comment, but i figured i'd throw these out there! :> (if some1 else sees this message pls lmk if I should dm it to matt instead 💖) ⤵⤵  lil video ideas maybe? *for main channel or personal channel >>  - cook & talk vid(s)! --> those r fun to watch + u get to eat once u finish filming :> - Peaceful Photo/video dump + voice over --> Calming to watch + meaningful things get through - random walk and talk/sit and talk --> very peaceful - How to vids / what to do vids  (make some kind of form online and ppl throw in what they might wanna see as a how to / what to vid idk) --> helpful + possibly interactive(?)   btw random talking straight to the camera is in fact nice to watch too! Helps when feeling lonely  (maybe the viewer has no one to talk to for a moment and would like to watch a vid like this!)... me LOL
Why is Matt actually so funny when he talks
matt talking about eating pickles made me have to get up and eat a pickle cause it made me crave one… 😭
💕I Love you matt💕  😈Your absolutely gorgeous😈   I have a question for you...... What's it like BEING a triplet?  Lots of love and kisses your biggest fan NICOLE LOUISE 💕
I drink pickle juice everyday😢
We need Matt to make a come back on his channel
I come back to this video whenever I’m at my lowest points
2025 anyone!
He's so cute😭
i love how he is telling us about himself because i have the same anxiety kinda
Matt I feel like you’re too hard on yourself. You’re doing a great job. Also you’re not boring. 😭🫶
I play the trumpet too!!
I am going to be as tall as him
Make more videos please
i love matts own channel
Him not being interrupted at all is AWSOME ❤
That ending is hilarious I’m always forgetting about eating and what I’m doing I only half ahh think things through 😂 also I would love for you to post more  This video was great ❤❤❤
Matt needs to know that a lot of people thinks he isn't boring. He is so funny  and adorable !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Watching this when I'm sad.
Ik you think that this probably doesn’t help at all but it really does thank you ❤
hey matt, ik that you most definitely won’t see this but as someone with anxiety and stress problems your channel helped me a lot, but i have 1 question, do you think that if you do another video you can do one about how to deal with stress in a specific situation, i’m a athlete and the team im on isn’t the best. i play softball and i’m a catcher so every play involves me and when i make a mistake i take it out in myself and i struggle to get out of my head after that, but since i’m in a game i can’t walk off the feild or write thoughts in a journal. i know you used to be a athlete so i was wondering if you could help!
14:11 yeah i love when that happens
8:18 damn we're the same height 😭
7:16 im sorry i laughed at the pause with the "Thanks Nick and Chris !!"
Matt is literally my comfort person. If anyone tries to tell Me he is weird or boring. I don’t care why don’t you go eat a Brick, I’m sitting here at 4:45 in the morning, crying eating brownies, trying to Contain myself mentally, while watching Matt, It has really helped me with my anxiety and hearing Matt talk about himself like that. Makes me want to cry because No Matt You’re not boring or unfunny without your brothers you’re really inspiring and do you have a good personality! So you’re probably not reading this but if you are, I just wanted to say thanks because you’re the only reason I’m still alive and you and your brothers are so sweet. It’s literally making me hold back tears while typing this. I’ve been watching y’all since 2022, even though I am a newer fan that doesn’t matter enough about me. Y’all are literally the kindness. Sweetest cutest heartwarming, triplets to ever walk the planet and if anybody tries to tell me otherwise I don’t care what they say because you guys are amazing and I inspired to be like Y’all I have a special message for all of you, Nick💜: I love you so much because you really make me feel like I’m not alone of my insecurities and your comebacks are really the greatest. Your laugh is so contagious anytime I see you I just wanna burst into laughter.Matt💙:  Look, I know you struggle with anxiety, but so do I you really help me realize that I’m not alone in this world It all comes down to you when I’m at my lowest and you just brighten my day. Chris 🧡: Chris, you are just the funniest little goofball ever whenever I’m feeling silly or sad it doesn’t even matter what mood I’m in I always go to you. Your laugh is so funny. It’s like this.BAHAHAHHA🤣 sorry that’s really corny but that’s besides the point either way I love you so much💜💙🧡 i’m sorry you probably don’t have time for this. It’s probably late and I didn’t mean to wake you if I did so you can get back to sleep Matt just know that whatever you do you are important and loved by millions especially me I could go on and on about you guys but it’s late and I should probably get some sleep so good night love you guys. Love you Nick 💜 Love you, Matt💙 Love you, Chris🧡 Sleep tight don’t let the bedbugs bite💜💙🧡☺️☺️☺️
for me, Matt is the only person in the World that can make me feel like I’m not alone like for the last few years I have struggled really bad with anxiety and it always comes down to These three videos on Matts Channel and it’s not just matt The Sturniolo triplets in general have really made me feel comforted and not alone. I watch them just go to sleep because it really helps me relax the way their brotherly Bond is so close really make me feel like a better person in general whenever I have no one to talk to all circles back to the triplets Love you guys🧡💙💜
Matt you should collab with Sunday and nick and Chris come and see Demi and Eli,
i thought they were taller😭 like i’m a girl almost 13 and almost 5’7
“im aiming for once a month” *proceeds to post once a year* 💀😂😅
Bro evrething gives me  anxiety
I love Matt, this made me realize him more than I do in the regular video. And it makes me so happy to see him and be able to know I’m not the only who feels like that. ❤❤❤❤❤❤
I'm sorry matt. You might not read this. But I'm sorry someone sxulized you. I hope you guys get better
matt, i know you will never read this but…   i just cried my eyes out. life hasnt been treating me well recently. i have anxiety, a bit of depression, and family issues. it’s not as bad as some people, but still bad. just found out today my boyfriend is talking to my enemy, a final blow in the stomach. you have helped me so much. from coping with the breakup, to helping not kill myself. you are the reason i’m still here. your voice soothes me so much, and hearing you talk just helps me instantly. again, you will probably never see this but i just thought i should leave this in the comments. maybe someone else is going through the same thing as me and needed this comment. for anyone reading this, there are people who love you. it’s not worth your life. keep pushing.  i appreciate you so much, Matt.
Matt babe, it's been a year in between each video on here it was not once a month😔
Your like so confident I want to do a YouTube channel but I don’t like my face online and my anxiety goes off so yea
Bro Matt Ur actually funny dude I love ur 2 videos u have lmao they really help me just so you know😭💗
Aww he got so fed up with the interruptions that he made his own video😭😭💔
The text boxes killed me 😂
This is my comfort video. Hope you post more ! I’m excited for the solo projects! Matt post anything. You have a fantastic unique energy even if you are simply talking in a car 💧 . Don’t underestimate yourself you are incredible . 👏🏿🎬🔥
Please bring back your personal videos there were awesome
He filmed this on my cousins birthday if anyone cares
15:36 me fr 😂
I understood you better than ive ever understood any one. no joke. i understood every single thing you said. it feels so nice to listen to somebody who understands or who can like relate or someone similar if that makes any sense.
Maybe one day he will post again… Maybe it will be the next tour suprise.. posting on his personal account 😭😭😭🙏
Your editing style is so funny I love it
Him saying he’s a boring person made my heart melt. I always feel the same and knowing I’m not the only one to think that makes me feel comfortable, even though I hope Matt gets to know how many people he actually entertains<33
Who else comes back here when your going back into the hole..?
matt's personal videos feel like a warm hug. i hope he posts more in the future. just him talking about anything is comforting, but especially stuff about anxiety
Matt we miss you please come back here❤
why was this on my fyp lol
Me
ANYONE HERE IN APRIL OF 2025
This randomly popped up on my fyp and i’m not mad about it. 100th time watch HERE WE GOOOO!✊🏼😭
Hello, Matt, my brother, I have a friend in here, she lives in Cebu, Philippines, and she really likes you and admires your face and personality, really hoping you're doing well there, she's sending regards to you, brother, may God bless you, brother
I wonder if he ever rewatches these?
and somehow i’m back here
Hi
Here we are again 😕💗
Anyone still watching this everyday in 2025????❤
2025
When life gets so bad you have to come back
Caleb Hoffman
Watching this because I’m about to go through a car wash and absolutely shitting bricks
Matt: If I ever see someone actually drink pickle juice out of the jar I would literally throw up  Me:😐 *im that someone*
2025 anyone?
I would love to see more anxiety vids because its so relatable ❤️❤️❤️😭
Your such a comforting person and your not boring i could watch you all day u make me feel so much better hearing u talk about anxiety is so heartwarming because i have it too and your also such a kind sweet genuine person ily matt
wewe
Me
Matt, ik this vid is from 2 years back but seriously dude. If people watch this whole thing of course we fucking love it! We are entertained w u blabbing ur mouth abt rando stuff, alr? Keep talking, love ya 😙❤️
i just found out about this (i'm a new fan, pls be kind) and this is comforting !!! i have anxiety too so i relate to a lot of things Matt is opening up. looking forward to the other videos <33
I'd definitely pick you!
i love when i almost forget a good memory its the best
he looks sooooo
i giggled in every pause he added 😭
so cute hes always talking about his brothers
5:47  I understand you Matt your okay And you don’t sound like an idiot
17:25
2025 first time watcher is here..
17:20 subscribe baby❤❤❤❤
I'm not trying to be mean or anything, but people say he gets anxious because of his brothers. And then people say no, they don't. But as he said, it isn't like a life or death anxious. I think that sometimes they make him a little anxious.    I take pickle juice like shots. I love pickles and pickle juice.
the part where u talked abt how when someone brings up smtg u had forgotten abt, but then remember how good it was, is soo true!
2056 anyone??
2025 anyone?
I know you think your boring but sometimes your channel with your brothers is too much for me to watch with the screaming so its great that there are your guys personal channel's as well
Your not boring at all Matt I love listening to you talk and your humor is so funny and we all love you Matt💙
2025, i come watch this video whenever i feel like i need
watching this having depression and anxiety and trying not to get a panic attack so i’m watching this
Matt your not boring. I would love to listen to you 24/7❤❤❤😊
When it pauses with the texting music playing oh my gosh I have to be so quiet cause half the time I watch these videos at like 12 AM but sometimes I’m too loud watching their things that they post.
i’m two years late buuuuttttt i just discovered you have a personal channel (i’m sort of new to the fandom ) but i’m so happy i did bc it was so nice to just listen to you alone and learn more of ur personality. i also like how open you are about your anxiety and that brings me a lot of comfort to know that it’s not uncommon to have and other people struggle with the same things i do. i hope one day you’ll post again soon because i love this content sm 🥲🥲
Matt, your are not boring alone at all. And I know this was a while ago and you may feel differently, idk, but you had me hooked onto the video at the start. And, I absolutely love that you are advocating for mental health and it really isn't talked about that much at all. I love what you are doing and thanks for being you! ❤  Your awesome! 👍
I feel the same without my two older sisters and I'm really scared for them to move out and whenever I think about it I cry and Im like sobbing rn
Omg the little scream at the end, he’s so freaking adorable I can’t😂❤
Omg I can’t with him he doesn’t understand how much he means to us. I also have anxiety really bad and I have been staying home from school for like 3 days and his videos help me so much 💙
him saying anxiety is the one thing that happens every day and is consistent and then saying oh that sounded sad i promise im fine, is me on a daily basis😭🙏
I miss this...
matt saying that he feels like he is boring has changed my point of view. i'm an introvert and always the more quiet friend, and i've literally tried to change my personality to become more funny or less "boring" thinking people will like me
The difference to matt then and matt now 😭
He sis o cute
Is anybody here I 2025
It’s almost been 3 years and every single time I have anxiety or just need a break I turn this vid on :)🩵
Yooooo❤❤❤❤
this is our boy guys, our precious boy
WE LOVE YOU MATT💅💅
Just bc your not as loud as nick or Chris doesn't mean you don't have a personality ❤
Matts my comfort person ❤
every time i’m having a horrible day i always come back to matt’s videos and i immediately feel like i’m not alone and that everything will be okay. Thank you matt 🥲❤
2025 ppl
Matt please please pleaseeee post more on this channel I love you so much and I genuinely feel like I’m not alone when your on screen. Like obviously no pressure for you to but it would make my year fr <3
I am battling depression, losing honestly, I'm trying to motivate myself to post to buy myself more time here, but you (and your brothers) have been a source of comfort. Thanks for advocating for mental health and being a great source for people who also struggle ❤
Always come back to Matt's channel when im feeling down
I love Matt sm
i love this guy sm
love u matt
Out of curiosity, how come Nick and Chris don't have their license?  Also, I love Matt!❤
I know its unlikely that youll see this and this will sound cheesy asf but i want you to know that i genuinely really care about you and i hope you know that all of your 714K subs are here for you. You truly are an inspiration matt. i love you.
PLEASE POST MORE MATT I LOVE YOU ❤❤❤
Still here 2025
I watch this video over and over again cause it just makes me comfortable idk how to explain it but yeah I just feel better watching this hahaha❤️ I feel better watching all the triplets too but they make me like happy like laughing and he makes me comfortable like he’s a comfort person idk how to explain but yeah ❤️
Hallo!!!! ❤❤❤ you just popped up on my recommendations page I subbed ❤
you're not boring! i appreciate you sharing
Hi Matt, i dont know if you still check cmt in your channel, but here is something I really want to tell you from a "friend" standpoint. If you think you're boring alone, which is totally valid, I think it's a good sign you should try out something new. Doing things alone and creating your own identity is challenging but it should be welcome. and I think out of the 3 of you, you and Nick will thrive as individual content creators the most. And even if Youtube is not forever, which it is, learning something new to support yourself in the coming years should def be on your list. Have an amazing day.
I literally found this account 2 years later hahah but you were and still are such a comforting person you’re not boring at all ❤️
Matt u don’t need to keep talking u can take a break from speaking to think love ok luv you
I love that you have your own channel. You three are awesome together, but you are amazing individuals as well!
Its been two years matt
Im sorry but Matt's hair in this video. He looks majestic.
im so glad this video exists idk why i would do without it
I think I rewatch this video about once every week
matt is so sweet, he is not boring he is honestly my favourite person
I play the cello too!!
IVE rewatched this video multiple times and every single time I feel more heard
Matt only being 1/4 taller than me and I’m 12 🙃
2025 anyone?
LOVE THIS BABE !!!!! <3
the way he keeps glancing at the mirror to look at “nick”
This video calmed me down so much it's actually crazy
Honestly if he posted him just sitting there breathng wed be happy and sit there and watch it
I actually want matt to continue his personal channel. I know he stopped but i would LOVE if he would start again 😊
no way this was 2 years ago 😭 i find so much comfort in matt, and i need more content from him 😢
Elle Bowring
Holy shit the way he roasts himself 😭
Just listening to your voice calms me down.
when matt said he gets bad anxiety, i get it because i also get really bad anxiety. and if Matt sees this, i wanna tell him that when i turn 20, i wanna meet him and ask to be his friend 😊
3:55 Now Chris has a license
Matt, I love you so much and spot light is on you for once and you deserve it!🎀
Is it just me or 13:25 and 13:44 was the funniest moments
3:50 I don’t think he understands how much we care about him and his like he could post himself eating a bowl of cereal and we go insane 😭
I need more videos🫶🏼
Matt screaming into the camera is always so funny to me
Matt you really don’t understand how much we really love you, you don’t need to worry about being “boring” without Nick and Chris because we love you sm<3
I would really enjoy anxeity talks and stuff, i feel like I can relate to like feeling boring, like i feel like my personality isn’t boring (yours is definitely not i luv u) but I just don’t do like interesting things or hobbies
I relate to you sm, i also get frequently anxious and i feel boring without my friends :(
I love him bro. He says picure lmaoooo❤️❤️❤️❤️ I love you mattttt
I’m so sad I’ve been dealing with all of this stuff at school and I’ve felt not loved by people at school and I cry all night every day. I need love, I never want to go to school.
Wish he'd make more videos solo
matt everyone of your fans, family, and friends love you for who you are. your humor, your stories, your style. everything. you’re amazing and truly everyone involved in your life loves you, you’re not boring. you’re your own person.
Not to sound like a pick me, but some of us who can relate would like more of this kind of content
Ok i just love him idk why some people don’t
i probably sound like a idiot "yes you do" and you know what thats okay!😊
i completely understand anything he thinks doesnt,like with the siblings part when he said when its having like 2 siblings then not,it feels like hes doing the best he can and he did amazing,i feel the exact same way about it,i feel so lonely without my brother.
Matt..you are loved and just take a moment to TRULY...TRULY..think about that. When i say i love you guys its not in a "boy crazed" teen way...im older..its your essance as a person. What you bring to the people who watches you and your bothers even when you guys included your mom and dad and Justin...you normalize family values and love. YOU MATTHEW are a GEM...dont ever forget it and try to vlog on your own again at the end of this video you seemed more fluid ..more confident. God Bless you Matt you and your family.❤❤
Anxiety is my hole life tbh it will  not stop 🙃
How did i cry while watching the  whole video
These comments are more related to the video but I drink the Pickel juice 🫠🫠🫠
14:09 me with animal jam
Love this video two years later ❤
He's so nervous I love him
caylee loves you matt!
Every once in a while I come back to this videos bc they're so peacefull, I can't wait for a new one 😩🫶🏻
back here can never get tired of listening to matt have all the space to speak his thoughts out
Matt you don't need to try. You are kind and honest and you are enough.❤ Hearing you talk about anxiety makes me feel less alone.
I just realized that im not alone in a lot that I thought i was alone in
I’m so happy that I’m not the only person that feels like this
this was made two years ago  i am crying
Matt your not a stupid idiot you're amazing and I completely understand you❤
i love u for who u r :)
We love you Matt ❤
I loveeeeee u ❤❤❤❤❤❤
You are not the only one that has anxiety and it is fine your are not boring and you do not sound like an idiot😁
anybody here watching this in 2024 because anxiety has been hitting them recently?
Stumbling onto this in 2024 cracks me up. Am I missing a few steps? Coz I'm pretty sure you stream? So like, am I looking somewhere else? Twitch? 😂😂😂
Matt…i love you
13:25 and 13:43 BAHAHAHAHAHA THOSE CAUGHT ME SO OFF GAURD- 🙏🏼😭
Same, I have anxiety to it is so baf
Matt, i hope u know i come back on ur channel to watch ur videos cos i struggle with anxiety too & ur videos give me alot of comfort, love ya matt!
matt is so comforting to me i think it’s because i struggle with anxiety and having someone relate so much is helpful 🤍
i love matt so much (i’m also the same hight as him at 13 😭)
u catch my eyes
I love you Matt
faith💙✌️
Still waiting for him to post a new video.
i keep coming back to this video it helps sm i just had my first break up while watching this so this helped me sm
I think its so funny, bc I never really got to hear matt for that long and hes actually funny
17:09 jewelry
Well it wasn’t once a month
This is my comfort zone y'all
do you think youll be able to have a video about different mental illnesses??? sorry I don't have insta or snap so I cant send this on there.
here in 2024 bc i’m so proud of how far he’s come. it comforts me so much to hear him talk about his anxiety and helps me to feel less alone in my struggles w anxiety as well. these days he seems so happy and like he is so confident in who he is as a person and that just makes me so so happy to see him thrive! i truly wish him nothing but the best🫶🫶i love you matt!
18:19 IM LAUGHING SO HARD
this is so comforting 😭
matthew bernard we love u. u r so entertaining and u r ur own individual person, i swear. u r amazing!! and we love u
Love you Matt! 🧡🖤 Glad you get to speak without being interrupted.
I WAS SITTING NEXT TO MY MOM AT FULL VOLUME WHEN THE START PLAYED😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Matt we all love you so so so so so so very much and you have quite literally saved my life multiple times and I don’t think you understand how important you are in my life.   Love you Matt ❤️❤️❤️
As a Korean who has ADHD and anxiety disorder and also maybe depressive disorder..(wow I'm a patient) It was fun because I felt like I was just seeing myself through you. idk🤷‍♀️ I think you don't need to be obsessive about boring or funny things. I mean.. because you are not boring...? You are handsome.  Handsome boy is not boring.
i have anxiety as well and i really like that he opened up about it cause it helped me a lot to know im not the only one
I actually love this.. I don't mean to be weird but I love just hearing only him talking
the outrooooo
We love you your so funny even by your self
I don't think Matt knows how to handle the camera but I love his camera core 🩷🎀🌸
Matt still screaming at end made my day omg i love you
안녕, 매튜. HELLO, MATTHEW. 나는 한국의 학생이고 17살이야. I'M SOUTH KOREA STUDENT, 17AGE. 나는 영어를 그리 잘하지는 않지만, 너의 영상을 보고 이 글을 꼭 남기고 싶었어. I CAN'T WELL ENGLESH, BUT WHATCHING YOUR VIDIO I wanted to leave a message because I sympathized. 나는 너와 나이도 성별도 사는 곳도 형제가 있고 없고에 대해서도 전부 다르지만, 네가 불안을 얘기하는 부분에서 공감할 수 있었어. I'm different from you in terms of age, gender, where you live, and having a brother, but I could relate to you when you talked about your anxiety.  이 글을 시작하기에 앞서, 가장 먼저 말하고 싶은 게 있어. Before I start this LETTER, I want to say the first thing. 만약 스스로를 재미없고, 지루하고, 개성이 뚜렷한 형제들에 비해서 흐릿한 사람이라고 생각한다면.. IF YOUR THINK of yourself as a blurry person compared to two brothers who are boring, and have distinct personalities.. 전혀 문제될 게 없고 오히려 그런 모습이 너 자신이자, 성격, 특색일 수도 있다고 말이야. (좋든 싫든 간에) THAT'S OKAY AND THIS IS A could be yourself, your personality, your character. (Whether you like it or not)  이렇게 말하는 이유는.. 나도 그런 사람에 속한다고 생각하기 때문이야. The reason I'm saying this is because I think I belong to that kind of person.  아, 나는 세쌍둥이가 대화하는 영상을 통해서 너를 처음 접했는데 너와 너의 형제들의 영상은 정말 재미있었어. AH, I first met them after watching a video of triplets talking in the car. YOU AND YOUR BROTHERS VIDIO THAT'S VERY FUN.  언젠가 패션, 악세사리 소개 영상도 찍어주면 좋을 것 같아. 결코 재미없지 않을 거야. 내가 보장할게. I think it would be nice to film a video of introducing fashion and accessories someday. I think it would be fun. I'll guarantee you. 왜냐면 넌.. 얼굴이 제일 재밌거든. 숨만 쉬어도 재밌어. 다들 그렇게 생각할 거고. ^^ (혹시 기분 나빴다면 미안해, 사과할게) Because you... your face is the funniest. It's fun just to breathe. I'm sure everyone thinks so. ^^ (I'm sorry if you're offended, I apologize) 그리고 재미없을 거라고 걱정하지 않아도 괜찮아. 걱정할 필요 없어. 네가 말한 것처럼, 여기는 너의 채널이니까.  AND YOU NOT WORRIED. THAT'S OKAY. BECAUSE Like you said, this is YOU ARE CHANAL.  네가 이 글을 볼 지 안 볼 지는 모르겠지만, 내 감상과 마음을 전달할 수 있어서 매우 기뻐. I don't know if you'll see this or not, I'm very happy to be able to convey my appreciation and heart. I'M SO HAPPY. 나 말고도 많은 한국 팬들이 너와 너희 형제 영상을 좋아해. 우린 너를 응원해. 부디 이 글이 네게 부담이 되지 않기를 바라. Many Korean fans like you and your brother's videos other than me. WE CHEER UP YOU. I really hope this doesn't burden you.  고마워. THANK YOU.  - MY MBTI IS.. I"NF"J-T - Some parts use translators, so I would appreciate it if you could read them considering that the sentences can be a little awkward.
Matt if you haven't I thinknyou should try Red Dead Redemption 2. I do feel like thatd be up your alley lol It's a special experience seeing you talk 1 on 1 with us. You're far from boring and I know you may get anxiety but you're doing good! Thank you for the content and can't wait for more when you're ready😊
With your anxiety, have you wondered if you are empathic. In a group of people I feel everyones emotions and become anxious leaving the room
The pink cut ins are SO funny😂
Is it Matt the only one that has his personal channel?
I am recently discovering your triplet channel ... And here i am  You are very interesting and fun to listen to ... And this is so comforting how you talk about your insecurities and stuff ...  So thank you !! ❤
we love u matt
his nose bleeding?
anyone here in 2024?
the music stop😭😭
i love you and you are not boring, in fact you are amazing
2024 here♥️
Matt thank you so much for helping me with my anxiety with out even knowing I wouldn't be where I am right now with out you
you aren't boring Matt you are just as entertaining as Nick and Chris I love y'all equally and I'm glad you talk about your anxiety it isn't talked about enough and a lot of people struggle the same way you do you aren't alone <3 also, just you filming this video is a step of growth and bravery so proud of how far you all have come even if I don't *know* you
You don't have to be entertaining Matt just be yourself, we love you and please keep posting cuz I love and need this content ❤️
i love these type of vids they are so calming
I always come to this vid when I’m having a bad day or week bc I relate to him sm ❤

It just popped up
I FLIPPING LOVE YOU
I really want him to start posting on this channel again
0:06 where is nick when we   need him😔

I really understand, I got anxiety through me and my friend arguing a lot last year and my dad's side of the family problems 2 years ago❤
Go Matt go you’re doing amazing sweetie 👏🏻👏🏻
why is he the sweetest person ever😭i love him sm😢and i really really reallyyyy wanna meet him someday. memories i would never forget ❤❤
he prolly is used to finishing his thoughts in his head bc half the time one of his brothers is interrupting him 😭😭
Everyone in the comments talking about how he is calling him self boring but I am over here watching this videos because I am having anxiety so when I have anxiety I watch this video because it helps me calm down
we  love youoooo matt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Matt is too relatable ❤❤❤😊😊😊
⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ IF ANYONE HAS INSTAGRAM, MATTS YESTERDAYS PROBLEM ACCOUNT GOT HACKED SO REPORT IF U CAN
0:10 me literally all the time 😂
Can anyone tell me where do you write questions for the Q&A's and the fanfictions I feel so dumb😭
I think Matt doesn't understand it BUT WE LOVE YOU SO MUCHHH like you're a really interesting person outside of the triplet group and we would really like to see more of that. Heart chain for you ❤⬇️
I have really bad anxiety and seeing matt just makes me happy and his calling himself boring just  makes me so sad even though he's not boring 😊
i love the random cuts
Matt coming out abt that makes me feel like I’m not alone. I struggle with a lot of anxiety just like rn for no reason. 😢❤
MATTTT please make some new vidssss please
17:20
17:02 THE SILENCE
15:08 INTERNET LOL
-why is Matt your favorite?  - ::::::::::
I can understand the being without your brothers thing. You guys are together 24/7 and have the genetic bond so I imagine it would be like being without a part of yourself for those of us that aren’t a multiple. I really appreciate your vulnerability bc you’re absolutely right. Mental health is not talked about in the creator community enough. You have an amazing platform considering you’re fans are teens and young adults and many struggle of them live with mental health issues. I love that you are looking at this as a challenge to learn more about yourself and how to be by yourself!
I LOVE YOU MATT!!! I LOVE HOW YOU TALK!!! ❤️ 😅
When matt calls himself boring it makes me fell like am not the only one like that when he opens up this makes me realize like am not the only one who fells like that matt realy help to understant and fell not alone and he doesnt realize how people appreciate him i mean personaly i love matt and i love that  he opens up about how he fells he is very brave im proud of him i could never.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤
Back here 2 years later❤
Matt is the person u can feel comfortable with bc he so kind and so sweet and is defo not boring ! We love u Matt ❤ (i don’t want to sound creepy sorry if it is )
That was a day before my birthday little did I not know I was 2 years later I would get stitches on my birthday
Matt your an amazing person and your not boring your chill there’s a big difference!❤️ If that makes sense..
15:40 thats laugh was so cute 😭😭💙
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
You are my comfort person and this is like an explanation jssjhshahajajah iloveyou❤
Me watching this in 2024
"oh! Here we are" THAT WAS ADORABLE AND HIS VOICE WAS TOO 😭💗
Posting maybe once a month no maybe once a year😭
I could listen to Matt talk for hours tho
Matt I loooooove you
Matt, i don't think you get how much we love you. You are not boring AT ALL and you are the last person that is a pick-me.  I love you literally so much (in the most not weird way possible) and i know that thousands of other people out there also do. You really helped me dealing with my anxiety stuff and im so grateful for that. you are an amazing person,please stay the way you are. We love you Matt ❤
Going back and watching this makes me feel so much better❤
i love him so much he’s so sweet.
Stop bc I literally love u Matt  😭♥
matt is so genuine .
i come back to this like once or twice a month cuz he jus comforts me sm
we love you matt you are amazing and so funny!! keep this stuff up!
Me finding this two years later and learning so much❤😂❤ also i drink pickle juice 👀🫶
thank u for existing matt
This will always be my comfort video.
literally my comfort person
i cannot fathom how THIS BOY is calling himself boring. i literally find myself grinning at clips of him without even thinking. matt is so funny, relatable, and people who really do call him boring or a pick me for 'talking too much about his anxiety' are such weak fucking links
Love u Matt!
listening to him talk feels good we need more of these
it is totally normal to have anxiety when alone. i also get major anxiety in drive thrus when i have to order just alone. its a lot of pressure tbh. love this stuff  ps, if no one has told you today, I LOVE YOU and i hope you have an amazing day
4:53 he couldve finished bc i literally only have one sibling😭
I relate to this my brothers go to my dads over the summer so I know this feeling
I think I have anxiety but I’m scared to tell my mum cause I get called an attention seeker
matt girls  (yes i liked my own comment)  👇
I hate the video when Matt was stuttering and nick yelled at him bc I stutter too, and sometimes it’s hard but we can read it but sometimes it doesn’t come out properly so just saying your not alone and just sayin I’m not one of those wimps ok just saying👌
Video ideas -morning blog -vents
I love how he started his video cursing lmfao
I love youuuu, i appreciate you sooo much
I get bad anxiety too❤
matt i love you so much your my favorite person ever
I know you don't care but I relate to you the most out of your brothers, and I know this is 2 years later but I'm seeing this on your birthday, so happy birthday, I love you❤
i always come here whenever i feel lonely or anxious. matt u were never a boring person. u help so many people and i dont think u realize how loved you are. thank u for being u, i love u<3
I’m so happy that in videos he looks happier, happy birthday Matt, we all love you
happy birthday. i love you
i love this boy so much
Matt is so nice, sweet, funny and more. It makes me sad that Matt thinks he is boring😢 I love you so much you make me feel comfortable and safe!❤
14:36  damn
“But it has broken once but my dad fixed it. Shoutout jimmy” 12:03
Long story short I love you Matt 💕
as a violin player i can totally see matt being an awesome cello player
ik exactly how u feel bc i have 2 other sisters and im always with them but when im not i feel so fucking boring
Aww Matt, it’s okay if you have anxiety. If you don’t feel so comfortable doing videos without Chris and Nick then you don’t have to. We love you no matter what you do. It’s gonna be okay. When you called yourself boring I felt so bad because i don’t think you’re boring, your funny ash and you have such an amazing personality. If I had to choose which Sturniolo triplet is my favourite I would pick you because you are just you.
I can’t believe I found this in 2024. Also your not boring everyone loves you so much, matt❤😢
Omg. This (miraculous) boy CANNOT AND I MEAN CANNOT be calling himself boring!😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
“How the fuck im I supposed to make this bitch focus” so fr tho
NO UR NOT MATT WE LOVE YOU SOOOOOOOOOO YOU ARE NOT NOT NOT BORİNG
We need anxiety talksss
14:18 I did in fact get that cs when someone asks me a deep question sometimes it just unlocks memories of years of lore tbh
It’s  him calling himself boring, meanwhile me smiling the whole time. I don’t think he realises how much we love and appreciate him 💙🥹
I have really bad anxiety too and im only 11,i have attatchment issues too so whenever my friends or anyone calls me crying i get really bad anxiety, but i help them and then its lien they raje advantage of me in every way possible.
Low key I feel like I’m taking to my brother (in a good way) love ya
him talking about anxiety makes me feel so much better about mine😭
We love you Matt you need to remember that! You are loved by so many people in the world❤ we appreciate you no matter what
Matt I don’t think your boring at all you’ve helped me so much navigate my anxiety I’ve had it sense I was 7 and when I started watching you guys it helped me so much especially you, you helped me understand that I’m not alone in it and that all I have to do is take deep breaths if I’m being honest you stopped me from doing things when I was upset that we’re not the right thing, you helped me understand that it’s okay and your so brave for telling people about it don’t listen to the hate comments I love you and I’m sure so many other people do as well
I started tearing up when je said anxiety talks because tjat words cuts feep when u know what it means
You are not a pick me, and you are not boring, and you are not anything you say negative about yourself because you are perfect!! You are doubting yourself while so many people are intimidated by your potential. I love you so much and so do a million more people!! 😊
3:22 matt calling himself a boring person
matt getting upset about having so much time to talk is so relatable this is why i love him so much. the way he talks about his anxiety and his personality being “boring” is very comforting to me. im actually going to watch just his channel because of how much this means to me. Thank you if you have read this all.
All of the little interjections had me laughing so hard!
We love you mattttt❤❤❤
This is super weird to talk about but I fall asleep listening to his 3 videos
the fact that i care so much about your mental health and your anxiety. like you and your brothers are such an inspiration to me and many people. and you are not boring you are literally so fun and nice and kind and really funny! you say not you worry about you but i literally care so much and i was crying almost this whole video because i felt bad and this might sound weird but i hope it makes you feel better!!!
woop woop
I LOVE YOU
i love how you want to speak about anxiety! i have been dealing with it since 2016 also. some video ideas could be talking about how you get through dealing with it. it might help some of us out seeing you deal with the same things.
Anybody here in 2024
Did u edit this it was this nick 😂
Watched this video for the first time one the 15th of July 2024 at 05:55 a.m.
We love it Matt 16:11
I love you so much Matt!! You’re doing great we appreciate you so much!! ❤️❤️❤️
Pls do the anxiety talkkk🙌🏼
We werent lucky apparently 😢😢😂😂
✧⁺⸜(●˙▾˙●)⸝⁺✧ʸᵃʸ
Hi
14:49 I hate pickles 🥒
2024 anyone?
This is way too relatable 😢 I love him
love you Matt ❤😍
18:20 😅I love Matt so much.  He’s so funny♥️
17:20 I thought he said “Subscribe baby”😭😅
14:34 Exactly👍🏼I don’t like it so I don’t eat it. I used to but I didn’t really like it. The pickle juice…I don’t know how people can drink that
13:23 I literally laughed so hard on this part😅like I literally choked✨
Tbh I did not know you had your own channel♥️✨I just saw this on my fyp. I’ve always watched all 3 of y’all together. I love that you have your own channel✨
Can you feel the same pain if your other brother in pain?
Are you INFJ Mat?
Do pranks on nick and Chris love to see those videos just a idea love you
I loved the video!! Dint change the concept Matt, it's hard to be a Chris girl now, love you Matt!!
Me literally looking in the back with the lights off just makes me feel dark for some reason
When Matt called himself boring it really hurt my heart, I dont think he relizes how much he impacts people. He has his own sense of humor and his own personality not everything has to be compared to nick and chris! also side note hearing matt talk for this long is so refreshing.
I literally love Matt sm he's my favorite
I also got anxiety when i was younger and also even though I am older I used to have a lot of anxiety but now I have less
Shout out Jimmy😀 cracked me up 😭
I watch this video every time I see it ❤😭
Matt ur the farthest thing from boring and we all love you💗
Matt I actually love you so much I love when you talk, I love when you laugh I really love you so much and you are so much more then you think you are. Even without your brothers you are worth diamonds and you helped so much of us during times when no one else was there for us, so thank you for everything❤❤
ily
Once a month if you lucky  *1 year later* only 2 videos posted😭
I rewatched this video and realized that he was suffering from anxiety! Matt’s not boring I started to cry a bit when he did say it! I feel so bad :(
I really hope Matt can see all these ppl who are in the same situation as him. That he's not boring. He's not alone.
matt makes me so comfortable and makes my day and as a person who struggles with anxiety hes so comforting
Who’s here in 2024
matt, i love you so much. You are therapy for me cuz i also fight with anxiety at young age thank you for being only person who knows how to  not make me feel alone. don't let your thoughts control your emotions, if you read this I'll be happy, if not that's ok🩶
Matt doesn’t realize how much he’s helped me with these videos, he genuinely seems like he would be a great person to talk to when you feel down, as someone with anxiety just Matt talking helps me so much.
Dear Matt, idk how much I can express this at all but I love you (not in a weird way) you’ve helped me with my anxiety and when I’m sad! My darker times have become brighter times because of you! Opening up about your anxiety helped mine so thank you! 💙
matt is so me😭(i got anxiety from bulliying,trama( really bad car accident),i get nervous and akward when i talk to people..)We love you matt!❤
Matt's solo videos are so relatable and funny!!!
You are not a boring person, Matt. I litreraly love this !!
Need more videos, you’re so relatable and genuine
i am here in 2024 but im also have bad anxiety aslo love you so muchh
I don’t know if anyone relates to this but I feel like I have anxiety when someone yells at me I can’t talk and I can’t breathe and I shake and I can’t pull myself together at school my teacher yelled at me and I asked to use the rest room and I went to the restroom and like I just was shaking I cut up with myself together couldn’t do anything I wasn’t breathing. I wasn’t talking to my friend came and she has really bad anxiety. She was helping me and I eventually stopped, but somebody had talked to me for a very long time and I needed to call myself down and I feel super insecure when people like call me fat ugly and I already know it. I just I just can’t stop myself from thinking. I’m so insecure I can’t stop myself from thinking bad things and I really so much to Matt. I really cry so much like I just wanna pull myself together and I already know bad person. I don’t know if anybody released this but if you do just please try and help me in anyway possible because I need somebody to talk to you and I want to talk to Matt is always there that is always there to help but I really like him so much, Matt. I really love You, help me so much recently and I’ve been writing in a journal from his other video and I’ve just like it really help me express my feelings to myself so I know what to do when I feel sad happy mad and angry. Thank you, Matt.
i feel like if i ever knew matt personally i would be able to talk to him about anything and everything. he’s literally the best! he makes me feel so comfortable, when im like sad or something i pull up matt and im so so so happyyy! i love you matttt❤️‍🩹

Pickles 🥒 so I was at Kroger in line and this older lady 👵 was telling the check out 🤑 woman craving pickles ice cream 🥒🍦from when she was younger and pregnant. As a guy eating 🤢 pickles with ice cream is way nastier 🤢 than drinking pickle juice. I couldn't eat 🥒🍦 without gagging 🤮🤢. You guys talking bout having baby on other channel you guys should all try eating pickles and ice cream without hurling 😂
Just started watching the 3 of you. This is the most I've heard you talk. I think your so used to getting interrupted you interrupt yourself 😊.
he literally helped with my anxiety so much like overall not just this video
So much relate! For me, this is the perfect yt channel when I want to be alone 😅🤗💕 I love the intro, that's so creative haha and funny 😂🤭 and I relate so much to your answer to the last question 🥴 God, I wish I can talk to you while you're doing a live. 🤗✨
Keep up the awesome work and videos Matt love the video
you are not boring!!!!! i love your vibe matt. you make me feel comfortable and relaxed in the best way possible. your funny, honest, sweet and everything else good in the world. don’t doubt yourself 🫶🏼
who else is watching these because youre having a panic atrack?
When he said subscribe baby 🛐 17:20
HE IS SO REAL
Dw were here 4 u matt💞
He is so good at explaining
but this is the cutest video on this app and I enjoyed watching it so please don’t keep saying that you’re a boring person
matt, please know that we love you, genuinely, at least me and i always will. being an introvert or dealing with anxiety isn’t a crime or doesn’t make you boring, i deal with it too, i get what you say, but omg, matt you have the most incredible laughter ever you make me smile everyday, thanks to you. trust me it’s not just me you make smile. you have an amazing personality with others and by yourself 🩷
matt is literally the sweetest person and soo funny, i can’t believe he thinks he is boring
watching this 2 years later hurts bcuz of whats happening. i love matt sm bro. i love chris and nick too but matt has a special place in my heart. ilysm matt
I love being a new fan and seeing this
having an older sibling and then a twin i can understand where Matt's coming from saying he couldn't be away from Nick and Chris for long periods of time like with my twin I'm with them every second of the day so her going out and me not is like tons and tons of anxiety wondering if i will be able to see my sister ever again
13:28 and 13:42 never get old
5:26 OMG THE LIL JAZZ HANDSSS!! He is actually adorable 🤭🤭👏🏼👏🏼
This is one of my comfort videos, whenever I feel down, I come back here... So thanks matt💌🧸
you're the coolest matt
I relate to Matt because I feel boring and I have really bad anxiety. Matt isn’t boring though🫶🫶🫶
Not him saying “weres nick when i need him?”
omg i love that he played the cello that’s my favorite instrument 😄
Matt js gets it
Matt doesn't understand how much he's helped me with my mental health and my anexity. He's the first creator I've seen on here that talks about stuff like that. Whenever he said that he feels boring when he's alone and I felt that sm. I grew up as an only child and I'm only like funny whenever I'm with my friends but that's it. Whenever people ask me what I do on a regular basis I say "nothing" cus I don't have anyone to do anything with.
we love you so much matt!!! 🫶🏼
the fact that you called yourself boring made me go depressed I almost cried. I literally love Matt so much he's my favorite and seeing all you the sturniolo triplets talk over him I just get sad and I relate so much to Matt because I have such bad anxiety (not to be a pick me) and him just calling himself an idiot and stuff makes me relate to myself when I talk to people because I do the same thing as him (not to be an pick me) but honestly if I ever meet Matt I literally want to sit down with him and just talk to him and just tell him that he's not alone and I can relate and I'm sure other people can too and If I ever meet Matt I would wanna give him the biggest hug and tell him how much he inspires me. ( I don't want to sound like a pick me or anything I'm really sorry if I do and ill delete this if that's the case. Sorry if this is too much writing) Love u Matt
MATT YOU ARE AMAZING I WOULD LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE TO SEE YOU JUST SIT AND TALK ABOUT RANDOM STUFF YOU FIND IN YOUR COMMENTS AND DO JUST A RANDOM CAR VIDEO 🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
The fact that he said "in the most not pick me way" made me feel sad for some reason reason😢
I love watching a video of him talking and not being interrupted by Nick and Chris lmao
Matt is not a boring person at all!! Like in all of his videos with Chris and nick Matt is usually the one that is always making me laugh! And I really relate to Matt cause I always feel the same way he does!!! We are always here for u Matt!!!
luv him smmm
i don’t think matt understands how much he helps almost all of us in his videos💕
As a violin player hearing matt say he played cello made me so happy bc I feel like orchestra kids are always known as "perfect" and its sm pressure on me and knowing matt understands that stress makes me happy❤
I love you, kid ❤
Matt you don’t realise how much we appreciate you and i love your anxiety talk the help me so much
I'm so late to finding this. I love this channel ❤
I'm alittle early to this
HOW DARE 19K PPL DISLIKE HIM HES GIVING US ADVISE I LOVE HIM SM SINCE 2021 AND CANT BELIEVE PPL HATE HIM HES AMAZING AND FVKING HELPS ME
I can understand him so well
if you ever have time could you make more vids on here i need the vids you make me not sad
y’all can play roblox😊
and y’all can play roblox
u can go through each others  phones 😂
Why is it so funny
no way it was 2 yrs ago
you should try doing podcast?
the way he had to interrupt himself with the random music pauses since nick and chris weren't there to do it lmao
Chris and Nick should make their own YouTube channel just like this
I really enjoyed watching your video, Matt. You always seems to me as a really comfortable person!) I felt little closer to you, honestly 🥹 Thank You
Watching this makes me not feel alone.
Matt is always the mellow one in the group and when he lets those little kicks of energy it’s just so funny and I love it so much. We all love you so much and wish you the best!
Matt I see my self In you with the anxiety I have siblings and we hang out and I kinda act like you I feel as if I don’t have a voice and I need them to have a presonaly but they make me feel boring
Who edited this video 😂😂😂😂
I love how Matt much and he talking about the things he goes through and the end when he says he did not get to eat the things he bought 😭
Even tho Matt only has three videos, I constantly watch all three when I get really anxious. Genuinely they’re js so comforting.
MATT.how dare u say ur boring u are the most entertaining person known to man kind ❤
it passed 2 years and I still love that video 😭
Nice to hear you speak more than 5 seconds before someone else speaks over you!
kinda miss matt personal vdo
15:41 The laugh is so cute omg
I love you so so so so muchhhhhhh ❤❤❤
I LOVE the way he talks about pickles like they are a person💓💓
feeling boring without your siblings is the realest feeling ever. i personally was as attached at the hip with my siblings as i could be until they left for college (my siblings are 11 and 13 years older than i am). my sister never moved back home but my brother did and he recently moved out, and im back in the same boat i was in 4-5 years ago and i have to relearn who i am 😭😭
the door lock when the person walked by 😭😭
At the beginning i was so sad like abt to cry then he was like (That sounded so sad i promise im fine) then i was like oh ok nvm but anywayss here for you Matt
Matt is literally me and I'm digging ❤
Hello. I'm Iranian and I can't speak or write English very well and I don't understand what you're saying, but I always watch your videos and I think you're very cool. I think you were upset, I hope you get well and happy soon.your not alone❤🤍🧡
Matt, your not alone
Omg I love Cello😮 I am in shock that Matt played the Cello. And yess that feeling of getting a memory you were about to forget, back is the best🤟🤌
Individuality - yes. 👍🏼 this is good for you.
13:43 DAM I WAS BLOWING EVERYTHING 😂😂😂😂
i love him
honestly im super depressed right now but watching this just makes me feel so much better I dont know what I would do without u 😶🥺
“yes you do!!”. AHAHAHAHAHAH
Am I actually the only person that recommended this before the Sturniolo channel, I was confused about the Nick and Chris Idk how, somehow I didn't know about them, just this recommended to me
Editor Matt bullying video Matt :)
Love you matt
Wait who tf drinks pickle juice you must be a fucking psycho if you do that anyway love you matt 👍🏻

Your not boring and you are just like me you make me laugh so fucking much!! And I love you
"Hey Matt, just wanted to let you know how incredibly brave and inspiring you are. Sharing your journey with anxiety helps so many of us feel less alone. Your courage and honesty are deeply appreciated more than you realize. Keep shining, you're making a huge difference!"
i loved that video so much ❤
This is for future reference to listen to matt talk to let you know ur not alone i under stand how matt feels when you have anxiety thats something not to mess with. ❤ love you matt
I can’t believe this video is 2 years old tomorrow. You are so loved Matt and you have made such an impact on this community. Sometimes I’ll randomly watch this video and it always calms me down and makes me just so genuinely happy. 💕
subscribe maybe that'd be cool. I love that part
I love Matt and I love that he is talking about his anxiety it's nice to know when celebrities/ YouTubers show who they really are

MATT YOUR NOT A IDIOT
Thank u for what u do man. Makes me feel less alone in a way :)
no bc  I could genuinely listen to Matt talk for hours on end bc he is so effortlessly relatable and I just love hearing his voice and I feel like he gives me a voice
❤❤❤
he literally speaks my thoughts and he’s so adorable so this is an incredible watch. It’s feeding my adhd
that’s wild
i’ve rewatched this a lot and i just think hes such a pure soul and too good for this world 🫶🏼
I think we can all agree nick did the editing
“where is nick when i actually need him”
The beginning 😜😂

You are not a boring person alone. My FAVORITE people to hang out with are the ones where I don't feel like I have to fill every second of silence with talk about nothing. The loudest in the room doesn't always mean the most to say. You are honestly real as fuck, super honest, and posting stuff like this takes guts. I know this video is a few years old at this point, but on the off chance you ever come back around here to check for new comments - give yourself some credit. I'm a couple years older than you and straight up, the people I find to be the "coolest" are never the most popular or sociable people. I like people who are authentically themselves and don't go with the crowd. And I guarantee if you're not already at that place mentally, you will be soon. Be kind to yourself dude. You are enough as you and not part of a package deal. Love from Somerville x
Those pauses with music is literally so funny (not in a bad way ofc)
Love you Matt :)
You're not boring Matt. You have your own personality and your own humor. Furthermore, not everything has to be focused on entertaining us, and not everything that is entertaining is fun.   It's your personal channel, feel free to do whatever you want with it as long as it makes you feel proud of yourself.
I would probably do the same thing that he’s doing in this video idk i just think I’m really boring with out like friends or my sisters but idk
talk about what it's  like being a triplet
7:40 once a month if we're *LUCKY*
Matt : *calls himself boring* Also Matt: *makes a 18 min 22 sec video*
Dude you were awesome! Just being yourself and being honest is all you have to do! I find it amazing that you three can get along so well and respect Nick for being gay! Just do what comes naturally to you! Your personality will carry you over the finish line!✌🏻💙👏🔥🏳️‍🌈🕊️🙏🏻
Hey Matt, if you see this - you should post a clothing haul. Your style is so cool. Lots of love 💜
Matt tem um coração lindo e eu espero que, atualmente, ele já consiga enxergar o quanto é especial e iluminado 💙
Im a year late but im happy hes not talking to the window this time
Matt calling himself boring and an idiot throughout the video is so sad
13:45 THIS EDITING IS HILARIOUS
matt fr funny
This is me when I pretend to have a YouTube channel and my siblings don’t wanna join literally every thing he said!😅😊
I'm so glad you made this channel for yourself and hearing u speak makes me so fuckin happy❤️please continue making these videos!! Love you so much matt
Tbh..........I just realized that I too have anxiety but it's just that it's not that bad as Matt's anxiety. His anxiety is more.....idk (I can't expreess it) bad I guess...
Matt you are better when you are yourself even if it means to talk about your  anxieties in your vid.
I love sunsets than sunrise.....idk.🤧🙄

I hope matt knows how many people love and appreciate him. this is literally my comfort video we love you matt💞
You are the mysterious one, let us get to know the deep inside Matt!
do some driving and talking videos!!
Matt can I just say, I want to apologize for the hate you’re getting for crying on stage. I don’t know why anyone would have a problem with you. Everyone gets over stimulated and we all deal with it differently. You didn’t do anything wrong. I honestly feel so bad, you don’t deserve that at all, you literally amazing. I love you Matt!❤️🥺
I appreciate you bringing awareness to mental health. I have had anxiety since I was born. I have general anxiety and social anxiety. I can handle general anxiety more. Social anxiety is intense for me. Sending all my love and support to anyone else who struggles as well. My twin sister is more outgoing than me. I rarely talk and when I do people zone out. I am talkative but rarely. I hope that changes overtime. Sometimes I feel like I annoy people and honestly just stop talking. I hope people can relate to how I feel. 🙏🙏💙💜💯💯
𝓣𝓱𝓲𝓼 𝓲𝓼 𝔀𝓱𝔂 𝓘'𝓶 𝓪 𝓶𝓪𝓽𝓽 𝓰𝓲𝓻𝓵💙💙💙
Matt’s little comments with the background music is sending me😭🙏
I love hearing him speak on his own 🥰
him calling himself dumb or boring and all of the other stuff makes me feel like i'm just horrible because I be havin the same thoughts-
me drinking pickle juice
I can totally relate to the feeling of being with your siblings and then don’t, it took me almost 20 years to figure it out that I’m an individual apart from being a twin, and somehow that’s a really hard concept to understand and go from there. I just kept attaching myself to other people until I felt comfortable enough to forge my own path by myself, and even then I still find myself going back and forth from time to time, but the key is to just keep going in the direction that makes more sense to you.
3:23  U ARE NOT BORING MATT. DONT YA EVER THINK THAT.
8:04 "I dont have nick interrupting me and i dont have chris yelling at me" is so sad
we loved the outro😋
I have bad anxiety and we sound the same talking about it.
Can you make a video of you trying food that you didn’t try ❤ here is idea ❤🎉
WE LOVE YOU MATT ❤🎉
Thank you. I do have depression and anxiety, so journals are my best friend. I just need to figure out how to control it. Watching Sturniolo videos help keep my mind occupied,. So THANK YOU! ❤
Twins and triplets have it hard to be apart because they have such an attachment issues with each other especially when they look identical and especially is a problem if they get married are very stressed when they no longer have that very close attachment wish you all the best
The Scream at the end 😭
2:40 I thought your nose was bleeding 😢
omg I feel so bad bro I love u Matt, u really helped me and I really do love u sm🫶🏼
I feel really sad that matt thinks he is boring matt you need to know how much we love you and you will definitely be my comfort youtuber
It's so sad when I hear him say he's boring he is amazing!
I think Chris and Nick are his emotional support people ❤
Omg I love the start its perfect
Me when duke dennis
We love you❤
matt I love you 😭
He made this a whole year ago and I'm still touched by this, for 1 listening to Matt talk without being interrupted is always great to me because I always wanna hear what he has to say. And although he thinks he's boring, he's actually the most enthusiastic triplet in my opinion and I wish him and of course his siblings the best.
My all best wishes to you Matt 💜
matt being the only one with his license is so funny to me because if im in a car with each of them i would not trust chris or nick
I will really be looking forward to the anxiety vids cause I really struggle with it
Matt is so funny.
i also did the trumpet twin
Matt is amazing
Matt you are not a pick me if you guy say Matt is a pick me for his  anxiety  f u Matt is not a pick me
Would you everrrrrr date someone 4 years younger than u ?
Honestly me having anxiety as well I would feel so safe listening to someone else that being Matt to talk about anxiety and I can relate❤
Calling ❤
Calling  Love babe ❤❤ ❤ Lilly YouTube Love 100  Matt 19
You make a lot of sense. I am an identical twin. My attachment to my brother was very strong but superficial as we grew up in a family where not much was talked about. Our individual identities were neglected to the point that our relatives often treated us as a unit, the twins. As I grew up, I became more aware of the need to be myself, and while a strong attachment to a twin sibling can be tremendously positive it also has many drawbacks. Freeing myself from the negative dimensions of that attachment and becoming myself has been a lifelong and very rewarding pursuit. Godspeed!
I've had anxiety since 2015 and I also feel attached to my best friends but I feel like I'm enjoying them X I mean this in the least attention seeking way
Omfg I play the cello too! I am pretty good at it, but I think I am loosing it (sorry I just wanted to say I don’t mean to overshare sorry if I am annoying you x)
I totally agree with what you said where it's amazing when people are talking and it brings up an amazing memory and it just then makes us happy, that happens quite a few times and it's just brilliant 💯😁  14:07
Matt I have anxiety to and I have seizures because of it so I feel you hope your ok♥️
I feel like Nick edited this 😂 13:16
I love matts editing 😭
I need matt to post again
Matt saying he’s boring makes me sad and makes me feel like I’m not the only one. I’m glad Matt is comfortable with opening up to us. We love you Matt !!!!
Listening to Matt talk without being interrupted is just such an explainable amount of happiness
Matt is amazing and I don’t think he realizes how much he means to all of us! Ilysm Matt!❤❤❤
i love matt, it feels really nice knowing that someone i watch feels the same things as i do. he’s kinda my comfort person.
O matt é eu e eu sou o matt
I hate that Matt thinks he's boring. He's actually really funny! He might not be as loud as Nick or Chris, but he's super relatable. I personally find him really really comforting. I struggle with anxiety, so it's nice to know others do too. It's so nice to see him share that with the internet.
MATT, SHUT UP! UR NOT BORING! IF YOUR BROTHERS SEE THIS THEY NEED TO TACKLE YOU OR SOMETHING.
Listening to matter without intrupptions in such a new thing.
Hiiiiii❤
I’m glad I’m not the only one that feels boring. I know I’m boring lol and I like that u are open an honest about your anxiety an stuff.
Tip for every video that you wanna make: Be yourself you dont always have to smile when others do just because you feel weird if you don't. And your Personality is Great Matt ❤❤❤ Keep on going
Matt you just needs some hugs ❤
Bro the fricken bird call at the end scared me so bad 😂
I know i'm a bit late but this video has made me realise how much i relate to Matt and kinda made me realise that its okay to be 'boring' on your own and to not know how to do things until someone else brings it up.
And my dumbass thought this was family friendly playing it right next to my parents😭😭
Matt I really enjoyed the video you made me laugh and feel calm and also just wanna let you know I want to see more videos but post whenever you feel like it not when other people want you too yk?😊
i love matt so much. him calling himself boring while im just smiling at my phone, love this !!
I’m sorry the editing is so funnny for some reason
"once a month if you're lucky"
you are the cutest
back to post here please😭😭😭 i could hear you talking forever
"dawn i was blowing everything" matthew😭😭😭😭😭😭
matt i love you leo king
I LOVE YOU ❤️😅
I love the way that he/you talk about your anxiety so openly and you have helped me through so much and idk where I would be rn without u or ur talks. I love you so much Matt ❤❤
the random pauses with music cracks me up 😭😭
you talking about mental health and anxiety is so needed especially for those who need it most. i had such bad anxiety before taking medication so you talking about mental health means a lot. it really does. ❤️❤️
i love you ❤️
you should really do gameplays, it would be funny
No, yeh I have 8 siblings 😅
You haven’t posted in so long
POST ON HERE MORE.
Such a cutie patootie i cant.
Try Indian food and snacks ? Chips... Soft drinks... biscuits... Breakfast... lunch... dinner..
❤
I have anxiety too your so fun not boring you don’t sound like a idiot🫶
I don’t think Matt knows how much we love him
Ilysm matt ❤❤❤ ur my comfort person ,ur amazing😊😊
"damn i was blowing everything" MATT!!!!!!!!!!!
This video was comforting for my anxiety tbh
I've known the Triplets for a few months, and I immediately identified with Matt. I've always been an extremely shy and anxious girl, that's always been a problem... you know that feeling of not fitting in? That's what I felt/sometimes feel, I had an extreme level of anxiety when talking to other people as if I always had in mind that they hated me. It was like that for a long time, I even had to go to a psychologist, which to be honest didn't help. Nowadays things are lighter, sometimes anxiety comes back and knocks on the door but not intensely. Matt brings me comfort, and I admire him a lot, I admire his pure heart, his way of being and his strength... we see enormous potential in you! I love him so much and I'm proud you to be able to bring this to the public, I don't really know how to help without sending positive messages... I just hope he's doing well, as well as he shows in the current videos and know that we are with you, the fans, Chris and Nick ❤
YES! I’m so happy to be here! I love your video ideas, and anything you notice you talk about a lot you can incorporate into a video, if that makes sense!
i actually love how he encouraged him self to do this
my love
Matt's such a cutie 😢❤❤
We love your personality <3
LOVE IT MATT 🤩 Perfect setting😝 Love you🥰
I come back to this video every day and I always agree every time, I've never gotten bored.
I feel like I want to be by your side.It makes me want to protect it.マットって守りたくなる存在🫳🏻🫴🏻
definitely clothing hauls though
I would listen to him all day. so relatable
This is so calm & comforting ❤🪶
I love Matt. I relate to him sm I got anxiety at a Young age and it feels so nice when people talk about it
matt you’re my favorite triplet like by far. i love chris and nick but you just seem peaceful and kind so just know you’re not boring you are just used to being with your brothers
ok i am so happy that you will talk about anxiety bc in 2020 i started to get it and its been affecting be so i really appreciate it Matt!
wow seeing him talk this much is so comforting! ❤ just do your things the way you normally do, its already entertaining to us. just watching your video is already a blessing to us 🎉🎉🎉❤
THE EDITING COMMENTS ARE HILARIOUS
“Subscribe baby” matt is such a cutie❤️
Matt is my comfort person ❤
my comfort person🤞🏽
Him calling himself boring broke my heart😢 he is my favorite person in this whole entire world.❤️‍🩹
💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
watching this video for the thousandth time hoping you post a new one soon! i miss your talkings :')
I felt like I was talking to him in the car 💔💔
Matt, please post at least once a month
I'm just in love with your videos
You should go through fan edits that people make of you
Matt is genuinely one of the people I relate to the most. Like the uncomfortableness of not having anyone else and u feel like u need to talk. He's such a sweet and kind person and deserves the best. We all love you so much Matt and are so proud of how you've come. ❤️
i’m rewatching all of y’all’s videos and you make me so happy i love you sm 💗
18 minutes of unfiltered and uninterrupted Matthew Sturniolo is just amazing 🫶🥹
you're literally my comfort person
18:13 enjoy it, honey
17:40 I love you so much
16:55 yes I love it I want to listen to such things
16:25 so cute
16:05 omg I love him
15:32 😂😂😂
14:44 same
Me too, I don't like rings
We love what you love 💕 do whatever you want here
We love you and we are here for you so whatever you do is perfect and entertain us if that's what you want 😊 we just want you to make more videos about things that you love so we will love it
I don't know why I feel butterflies when you talk ❤😂 I really love you and you are so calm and sweetie Not boring
I love it here 😂 Matt is so calm and funny
Matt: How do I make this focus? Should I tap it? Me: It's not a phone *Taps it and it works* Me: 🤡
You’re a lot like me 🥹💚
Is this his actual channel or fan page?
I need your clothing videos, Matthew :)
You know Matt, it's okay to do everything with your brothers. Maybe for those of you who have been together your whole life, there is this feeling of needing to work on your individuality for a while and feel that you are someone without depending on anyone. But the truth is that everything that people spend their lives looking for, preparing to have, you already have. Which is love. People to share the good and bad moments, people who make you feel happy, who support you, who you can trust with your eyes closed. Affectionate relationships that many people like me don't have, that's why it's so cool for us to watch you. And sorry, I know I'm late to comment on this video. I like you a lot ♡
it makes me so sad when he thinks he’s not interested without chris and nick, because that is soooo not true matt, we love you so so so much!!! 😭😭
13:44 bro-
It’s called anti social
that’s why matt’s my favourite
Dude you are genuinely me. When you said the “In the most non pick me way possible” I say that shit all the time dude. Like I’m so embarrassed to even talk about how I feel because it feels like I’m such an attention whore. I have such bad anxiety and when I’m in certain situations I feel like I’m the most “boring” person ever because I just shut down at certain points. It’s horrible and I wish I could show the real me without my anxiety dragging me down all the time. It’s just so hard.
Matt u are DEFINITELY NOT BORING I would die to be ur friend irl ur amazing and so entertaining I love learning more abt u and ur anxiety I personally have anxiety disorder and you bring so much comfort to me and u really make me feel less alone with my anxiety I LOVE U SMMM <33
Matt do it again  I miss you
Matt you are not boring by any means, I have seen you try to say something, anything and the other cut you off and call you names. I laugh and get a kick out of your humor and listening to you talk because you have a great sense of Humor. so matt keep up the awesome work and God Bless you.
Commenting on every video until Jesus comes back
hey sweetheart ❤️‍🩹 this video is 1 years old and i know  lot of thing changed in your life. I’m new here so, i want to tell you some stuff. first of all you are not boring, u are so sweet and interesting person. we all have our ☠️ so don’t worry about yours and feel free to talk.  and yes! everything makes sense. you are so comfortable person, to chill with and talk. so yep, go ahead  I’m always here to listen.  thank you for being yourself 🫶🏻
matt is truly my comfort person , he just gets me
I subsribed as soon as I opened the video. Love yall! 💌
Okay but Pee in a SINK?😭
You are awesome just the way you are. Been my fav. From the first time I saw the triplet channel. So much relate.
Matt is so relatable like i cant even explain it. Sending love & wish you luck 🫶🏻
im kinda new here, but i feel like out of all three he has the best jewelry, so maybe as a new hobby start getting into fashion. but all n all i think i like matts personality more than chris n nick cuz he is so calm, and so sweet. Not saying i dont like the other. I gravitate toward him more. But yea i want to see more vids!!!
Matthew actually so calm person like his voice is everything ❤and you literally trust this person ❤❤
I’m so happy my favourite yt have anxiety like me ( also off topic but at 15:42 his laugh was so cute)
Ur rlly funny and not boring and nice
Coming back after he hit 600k🫶
My friend is IN LOVE WITH YOU and uhh make more videos I guess?
just random , pokemon go videos?
am i the only one who think the sturniolo triplets look just like chico?
You doing amazing. Don’t stress yourself out. You made feel comfortable and loved listening to your own thoughts. ❤❤❤
this dude screams the damn f word every time he forgets what he was gonna say
Is it just me or when the person was behind his car he looked scared when he looked in the mirror?
Matt you are NOT boring you are a really good cool guy would like to meet up with you someday you talk like me you are really cool no you are not that tell it like it is ❤
Love ya Matt thanks for your videos
i was scrolling on youtube cause i was sad and love watching the sturniolo triplets video then i found your personal youtube channel and i clicked it and immediately chose to watch this one video. I felt like i was listening to my friend's rant. Which i dont have in real life. Thankyou matt, sending love from Malaysia ❤️🥹
this video made me realize how much i relate to matt, he's like a comfort person to me :)
But he isn’t boring his fun but he also as anxiety like me
Wait my he lowky look fine tho
when he said that he was boring it represented me but when i was with my friend
You make me feel normal love you so much keep going im proud of u thx for this video i had so much fun watching this❤❤❤
Liking this video purely for the uneaten snacks and untouched Snapple 🤣🤣
personally i would like to watch you playing a video games, i think when person is not good at it, it makes it more entertaining and the audience gets more involved watching this process. anyway, you can film whatever you want and observe comments and recommendations and other kind of feedback  i will eat any kind of content from you.💕🎀
Matt is literally eveything but boring. Honestly, Matt just cause you're more laid back doesnt mean you are boring. I hope you know how much people adore you and i love your personality
You are great by yourself for sure! I was wondering are you guys like identical all three cause you guys seem to be! I can tell you guys all apart easily but I also had five sets of twins that all lived in a subdivision with like three streets, something in the water?! Lol
i need Matt to post more videos, it's kinda corny but i really love to hear him talk after having bad anxiety, he's so calming idk
genuinely I’d watch them one in a while , I’ve had anxiety since I was 3 so that’s nearly like 10 years so
How i love this boy
❤
17:20 ❤️🥺😍
Matt is so funny I dint know but he’s so understanding and underrated he’s so relatable
i’m feeling upset right now and idk why so i’m watching matt’s personal videos
❤❤
You remind me of myself a lot like the way you talk is similar to the way I talk. Like growing up, I’ve always been told that I talk slow and that everything that I say doesn’t really make sense and you know just like in your videos, I’m always the one that gets interrupted and stuff, so I totally know how you feel. It’s like some middle child syndrome or something. But anyway, LOVE YOU MATT ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love rewatching old vids of them . I have been a fan 3 years 2 days ago and I love watching old video ps of them because it shows how much they grown and become stringer snd I LOVE it ❤️
i would love to you to make more videos. especially if you talk about anxiety. it helps to know that other people go through the same things.  for the clothing hall you could do like a fashion show style video
i’m a chris girl but omg he’s so sweet
THE OUTRO 🤣❤️
Mattie boy❤️
i might be late to this video..but matt honestly made me feel at comfort because i can relate to most of the things he said and i'm so happy that he is opening up to us. thank you for inspiring us matt!!
3:15
Hi Matt Matt
i love Matt SM hes totally my comfort person!
I just pressed the video and was greeted with the word 'f√ck' 😔
the fact i’ve watched this video loads of times n did not know i was not subscribed until now 😭
I think I just saw a man disappear out of nowhere
This just warms my heart
I’m back watching this cause I needed it ❤
Matt you’re the best
Matt is so comforting person🥹I just love how u r being himself LOVE U MATT KEEP GOING N TALK WHATEVER U FEEL ITS OKAY U R NOT SEEKING ANYTHING WE LOVE U🩹❤️‍🩹
Matt is literally my comfort person how could anyone call him boring
I love u
It's always a good idea to come up with stories if you are alone about your experience with your job or on your day.
It makes me feel so sad when he says he’s boring that’s how I feel I feel like I’m boring but with him saying it makes me sad
I drink pickle water😭
Stop. I love Matt so much he's literally my comfort person. I feel so safe watching his videos.
Te amo amor
we love you matt
❤❤❤❤❤
when matt chose the side kick and said “ your not letting as many people down you know “ i started crying ilysm matt your amazing
Real ones know Matt is the G.
dw abt being annoying ur not
It's weird that you're not interrupted every two seconds✋️😭
love you so much you sweet boy
Please keep the screams at the end of the video. I love them.❤❤❤
Hey Matt! I just started watching you guys and I can tell you this… I myself struggle with separation anxiety and depression, and I tend to get sad whenever people are busy. I can’t say I know exactly how you feel when you say you feel boring, but I do understand the concept of not having anything funny or interesting to say. If I don’t get out of the house and if I don’t hang out with other people, I feel lonely. This is because I am not comfortable with myself, I don’t like hanging out with me (if that makes sense). The way that I cope with this is hobbies, for me I crochet, sing, and play the ukulele. We are obviously different people, so you make YouTube videos. Anyway, I look forward to watching your videos! Also please don’t compare yourself to others. Comparing is the best way to ruin something special.
Hair cuts or hair transformations and I get what you get btw this is my friends account I’m just logged in on hers and I love you so much
Idk if it's too late to watch this video, but you're doing grate matt! Love ya🩷
how am i just now finding out this channel??? im loving it mcthough
keep moving matt we love you
Its been a year <3 hes grown so much <333
i find it so crazy that this video i found a year ago is what made me obsessed with the sturniolos
I can relate to Matt, my anxiety gets bad to where i don't eat and can't sleep and up all night and get nervous and get to where i feel like im going pail and pass out. It gets bad and so him talking about it and his experiences it helps alot and comforting.
you should do a jewelry or clother or wtv tour
We love when you talk about yourself and helping out people with mental health and anxiety and it really helps people ❤❤
I love getting this glimpse into who you are without your brothers around. You have such a sweet personality.
live laugh love matt
You’re not boring. You just need to be more confident, trust yourself and what you bring to the table, which is by just being YOU 🤍🤍🤍 You got this ✨
He’s so sweet ❤😭
eu me identifico mt com o matt mds
It’s awesome to hear Matt without being interrupted
You are the sweetest thing on this earth Matt. Knowing that you think you’re not interesting on your own hurts my soul Because I genuinely like you The most and think you’re the most relatable out of your brothers. It’s been so bloody nice to hear you speak without being interrupted for once.  You deserve the world and more 🫶🏽
rewatching this again i love u and i promise ur not boring ur my comfort person
I love the fact that you made your own channel to talk abt you im a huge fan and your my fav triplet i rlly look up to u with the anxiety and stuff as i also suffer with it and your sense of humour is so underrated love you so much matt look forward to the videos u are yet to post 💕
It's nice seeing Matt in a new light
He helped me smmm, before i found his channel i literally wanted to end it all SO THANK YOU MATT LOVE U FOREVER❤️ i will FOREVER be thankful and you’re not boring i js want you to know that (and i love how he screams at the end like on the other channel)
Love that this just popped up on my feed 😮❤ glad he has his own YouTube channel
I come back to these videos every once in a while and they really make me so happy. Especially when I'm not having the best day, you bring me so much comfort <3
You are you Matt. You're very interesting, comfort person💖💓💞💕💟 I can listen you all day and  all night. Do more videos about yourself.❤ I love you...
I’ve never seen someone so relatable to me like Matt, we literally have the same name, the same taste for food and other stuff, and I have the same social problems and anxiety as him, he makes me feel good because with him here, I know im not the only one with all those things.
You can also do a video about your unpopular opinions.
Can you like talk about some tips for anxiety, for example Im supposed to go in a new school in the middle of semester and I'm to scared to do it all. And stuff like presenting infront of the class etc.
This video made me feel like I was entering Matt's personal space, not in an uncomfortable way, but in a way that made me feel happy that he felt comfortable enough to open up to us, thank you Matt, I loved the video and I will support you in the next ones that come. 💗
matt is such a comfort person and tbh i needed to hear this
I really wanna see clothing halls and I love how Matt makes everyone feel so comforted<3
Lmao Thanks for telling us why you didn’t eat hahaha  Love that 😅  Yea, there’s a lot you can do for sure on your own😊
Aww dude There’s so much you can do on your own-especially since you are able to get around and drive!
I love hearing Matt talk in his own and experiencing his personality. This was good!! Please moooore!
i really wanna know if you are into music and if you are what do you listen to
I love his way of editing
Matt is just my comfort person i love him so much i wish he would be my brother and be as sweet and kind as he is <3
I love you so much ❤😍😍
You are doing good matt♥️
If matt ever sees this, I am so much like you. i have anxiety, and i have some mental issues, but you and your brothers are my comfort people, but i can relate to you most, but i love you all. This may sound wierd but i js thought id  say it.
Matt is too 🥰
Matt you’re my comfort person, even though we don’t know each other. Watching this video gave me an enjoyable moment of peace, fun and comfort
what he was saying abt the rings and bracelets was so real. i love necklaces but i literally cannot keep bracelets or rings on for more than like 2 hours bc i hate the feeling of them on me. i honestly don’t even know how to explain the feeling i get when i wear rings for too long 😬
i love matt sm he is such a comfort person and hes so sweet. honestly sometimes i watch him in the group channel and i feel bad bc u can tell when hes having anxiety and i feel so bad. and when he brought up the interruption thing i was like YESS I LOVE WHEN MATT TALKSS❤❤❤
i just thought everyone should know this but i vomited in my mouth while coughing and i swallowed it 💕 your welcome
I relate to you too hard, im watching this breaking down in the middle of an anxiety/panic attack.
My cat litteraly lay besides me and listen
Its so funny to me how matt calls himself boring when he's literally the complete opposite. Always sad to see really amazing ppl not realise just how amazing they actually are.
I love this because it’s so realistic and relatable you are doing so well Matt we love you ❤
Dawn 😢😂❤😂😢🎉😮😅
Matt talking about how boring and bland he feels one makes me feels amazing and him talking about his anxiety is so like amazing cause like I feel feard yk
PLAY ROBLOX
this is so cute we need more vids like this
You being vulnerable and real is entertaining enough
That was the cutest thing I've ever seen and you're definitely not boring and keep it up I'm looking forward to your videos <333
Matt is literally my comfort person😭💜 him being awkward makes me feels so fuzzy inside
matt is my comfort person i can relate to him so much
This is my favorite video on YouTube and in the entire world. Matt’s such a comforting person.
im so proud of matt. starting his own channel without his brothers is such a great start for his anxiety. and i relate to matt so much. hes my comfort person. i love him so much. hes come such a long way!!
Matt, you are not "boring." You don't sound "stupid" or "like an idiot." You are so so so special to all of us and help us all so very much. You talking about your anxiety, how to manage it, and how it feels really really helps all of us. We love you so much. Speaking for myself, you are my comfort person. You are such an important person to me, and even though you won't read this and don't know I exist, you mean so much to me. You are such a kind, caring person who helps so, so many people through life and makes so many people happy. We love you, Matt. 💗💞
The way I relate to Matt so much. He’s literally my comfort person. He reminds me everyday that other people feel the same way as I do and I’m not alone.  I adore him so much and I want him to know that he is not boring at all and we love him so much ❤️
I was waiting for the weird noise at the end of the video 😭
I relate so much to Matt it's actually terrifying. I struggle a lot with my mental health every day and it is hard for me to open up to anyone. I don't have siblings so I feel very lonely sometimes. Seeing Matt talk about that and his struggles brings me comfort and I understand that I'm not entirely alone. Also Matt's humour needs to be appreciated more
It's so comforting to just listen to someone talking👏
if you really see yourself like I do, you would see that you're not an "idiot" or boring, you're awesome and very funny with your brothers or without them.   we love you and the boys, so think about it. everything that you choose to talk about in this channel, will be great and funny, we trust in you✨️💗
Matt is genuinely so much more funny than he thinks he isnt boringI feel so bad for him,I hope his anxiety gets better
ILYSM YOU HAVE HELPED ME SO MUCH ❤ 😊😊😊😊😊😊
I fucking adore Matt I love him so much he deserves everything
i’m so late, but honestly i love how matt uses “you” when talking to the camera. i feel like i’m really talking and listening to him. also, it’s really comforting that he talks about himself, and his anxiety, that is something that i struggle with too. we love u matt!
love u bud <3
matt’s 100% my comfort youtuber 😭 ( nick and Chris are too but Matt is just so relatable ) the answering himself makes me so happy for some reason😀
Matt you make me so comfortable 🫶🏽

If you borring .. you mush have a pet matt.. maybe cat.. or doggy / cute pet / guguk.. ❤
Love watching this video
ik im watching this so so late but every single day i have so much anxiety and the only thing that will make me feel better is thinking abt the sturniolos, looking at my sturniolo triplets bracelet my friend made for me, etc, and ik this sounds like rlly bad but just like im glad that matt is talking abt this bc it makes me feel soooo much better  edit- no im not obsessed i just dont have a lot else in my life rn that i can hang onto
Hey! I know it’s a year later but an idea is a while video for tips on anxiety because a lot of your personal followers struggle so if u could do that it would be great
i love him so much because i can relate so much and his videos are so so so comforting
Hi and my name Kayla biehl nice to meet you and you doing great in your life and i have anxiety too lots in my life and i try to learn how control of anxiety to keep calm and keep positive thoughts and you should talk about your anxiety of your feeling so everyone can help you with that you will feel better if you try tell them they will completely understand your feeling and you are amazing guy and i hope you got my comment by me for what i said and love you so much
Matt's humor is equivalent to a 14 year old teenage boy's humor
I'm 16 and I'm taller then Matt 😅😅
Im missing Matt rn....rewatching all his videos to help cope rn
first your not a boring person and you and your brothers make my life better, your a big part of it. i'm happy that i found you guys online and you are my biggest comfort person, it's cool that you can talk about your anxiety!
Hey!!! I know it’s been a while since you posted this, but a video idea could be like all your anxiety tips and ways to help for other people that have it too!

Nick editing 5:50 yes u do like 😭 😂

I wish he knew that most of us think that he’s so sweet and not boring at all! Don’t listen to ur brothers when they say stuff like that bc we luv u Matt and u r our comfort person! 🙂❤

I have anxiety too… I have always had a fear of public speaking and ordering food at a drive thru.
LMAOOAOAOAOOooOoao 13:17
I am just starting to realize I have anxiety thanks to Matt lots of people told me that anxiety is something that is a very big thing but like Matt said it comes in small forms which I feel everyday
18:00 SNAPPLEEEE HAHAHAH
Make more videos like this
OMFGGG I RELATE TO HIM SO MUCHHHHH ILYY
I love the video talks
I LOVE the idea to make a video about anxiety❤ bc i have anxiety and i need some tips , how to control it😅
you’re not boring and you don’t sound like an idiot matt, i promise 💗💗 you’re just being a human 🥰 much love to you! you hold a special place in my ❤️.
i will always come back to this video, i am so glad that we have this video because we can listen to him without getting interrupted.
i feel so comfortable here. i appreciate this so much, love you 🫶🏽
I feel like he should bring back kissing the camera at the end of videos
always coming back to this video🥹
him talking abt his anxiety, yes this is 1 year ago, makes me feel so good abt my anxiety bc im only young and have SEVERE anxiety, it makes me feel normal if a ‘celebrity’ also has it. Love you Matt, keep it up c
The owl scream at the end lol
Pls, I identify with what you are saying, I have a twin sister and being alone is so weird. But Matt, remember to be yourself, love you x
I would love for you to make videos about anxiety and stuff because I have it and yeah that would be nice. Love y’all’s videos
Help when it said I was blowing every were 💀
It’s crazy how much I relate to this boy, being open about your anxiety has helped me a lot in the last few months with mine and whenever I feel overwalmed I go back to this channel and i do a rewatch of every single video bc makes me feel less alone and understood Matt you don’t know how much I love you and I’m being honest, I don’t know were i’d be without you and your brothers I know you probably won’t read this message,and it's fine this way, but I just want you to know how important you are to me and how grateful i am for everything you’ve done thanks for everything, love you sososo muchh🫶🏻
15:06 I seriously am gonna cry the way he said internet sounded so flipping funny 😂😂😂😂
Watching this a yr later and I wish I could tell him how much he has improved my anxiety by these little ‘boring’ videos but they are not at all boring they have probably helped loads of people with the issues they are having
It's been 1 year since this video and I still come back and watch every thing on his channel when I feel like I just need to hear his voice and it makes me feel better
Ur perfect matt don't say ur weird or boring ur perfect
shoutout jimmy😭 12:02

THIS IS SO GOOD. ur literally so funny! ik i’m hella late but i’m proud of u !
Matt is my therapy.
i’m rewatching this and i just wanna know who edited this. Nick or Matt?
I have a sister who is three years older than me. And we used to hang out with my cousin , and he is one year older than me. we were so close when we were kids. We used to hang out all summer together And after we became teenagers we stopped hang put like that, and since I was the youngest I thought I felt the most abandoned feeling !(!!?) But later I realized my cousin also felt that but because it was getting weird since we were getting older ... Parents and adults decided it's not good anymore for us to hang out like that anymore!!  Sooooo what I wanna say EVEN ME in this situation felt that And I think I understand how harder and deeper it is for twins and triplets
im here from 2023 and let me say you are the least burning person. I think your so funny and I relate to you so much. your def my fav triplet
the "omg i rlly have to pee rn and thers not a bathroom for like 5 mins" omg i love it
one year and this vid sill hits  (ps: love you matttt :) <33333)
I love him I love yall
I love him I love yall
hi
I love going back to this video and Matt opens up about his anxiety to everyone and I think it’s amazing that he can help people with their anxiety by talking about his and I’m very very proud of you Matt.❤️ edit: he’s like a comfort person to like the whole fandom of their group account and like the people that found his personal channel I feel like they feel comforted Love you Matt.❤️
we appreciate you so much matt, you’ve saved a bunch of life’s including my own. you’ve been a huge impact on thousands of people. thank you for everything💕
Aww Matt your amazing hope you make more vids for us people who don’t talk that much with anxiety lol 😂❤❤❤
ILYSMMMM
Hey I know I’m late I wasn’t signed up to comment this but Matt calling himself boring make me feel like I’m not the only one who feels that. Matt makes me feel confortable and amazing and he is just so adorable and I love how he is confortable talking to us about his anxiety I love u matt
Opening about your anxiety is soooo good for people suffering with it because they can actually relate ❤ Ty
i love how he says FUCK
Hopefully you enjoyed your skittles
I freaking love the memory thingy
“Pickles never did anything tuh me” ☠️☠️☠️👏🏻
Ohmygosh the written commentary in between clips kills me 😂😂😂😂😂hilarious, Matt.
hearing matt speak his thoughts it’s so comforting
He literally make me fell like I'm not the only one feeling the ways he is feeling..
THE LITTLE COMMENTS WERE ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS
matt dont doubt yourself, i literally understood everything that you said in this video. youre too concerned with how youre portraying your words, just do whatever you feel like doing
i really just needa say that matt talks at the PERFECT speed. im the kind of person who will get pissed when talking to somebody if they talk too slow or fast, and this is just perfect which made it 10x more enjoyable to listen to him talk on his own. also you arent boring at all, nothing awkward about solo videos!! just stay confident. x
THE EDITING IS SO FUNNY
THE BLOWING LMAO
math stop putting yourself down your doing amazingggg!!!!
i’m a twin myself and i have anxiety and attachment issues to her too, im going away for a week with college the longest we have been away from one another is 1 day 😭😭
listening to matt>>>
i know i’m late to this but i’m so proud of you matt
Maybe you can do a video on life tips
matt doesnt understand how funny he is even on his own, sure its not the same thing as it is with chris and nick but this was still super entertaining
Matt in the beginning not knowing how to make the camera focus is so funny😭
Who's here in 2023?
I just got a anxiety bit his first help me so much
i have anxiety too :(
I Love you mat ❤
I understand the anxiety so much 🙃 and your not boring
Home boii, your a big man your brothers are, but you reach a lot of us that have anxiety
I love you Matt keep on going on
❤
fantastic!! way to just do it!! we can’t over think all the time. loved the video. Great job Matt 🤗🙌

‘Damn i was blowing everything’ 😭😭
No because I love Him he is literally just like me he's actually my favourite but like he's so relate and he's just perfect makes me feel understood I love him but not in a creepy way

Matt this is seriously the type videos i need on those days that i just don’t feel like watching really hype videos and stuff and i really relate to you in a lot ways and i really enjoyed watching you. And you are not boring or weird, you can say what you mean and not feel shame about it, love you keep going🫶🏻
Omg I just got here
Matt is so cool! He is also an amazing human❤ we love you Matt
I love it when Matt actually gets a chance to talk.  I really like that he wants to talk about anxiety though it's not brought up enough in society.
Dude, i just listened to this video while I caught up on art for school and I was so productive genuinely think it was because of matt.  thanks matt <3

I love you so much Matt. You’re so sweet and comforting. Keep it up!
ilysm <33
Honestly i love these vids usually ur voice isnt fully heard over nick and chris but in ur channel the focus is on you and your underrated and i love how open u talk about ur anxiety it makes me and others feel seen 🤍
Matt saying he has attachment issues to Nick and Chris is actually so sweet
i am soo proud of him brooo
I feel you for the jewelry part fr. I only wear rings and bracelets for like a couple minutes, but I can wear a necklace for hours. Also I know this was from a year ago, but your definitely not boring, you are just your own person and have different likes and dislikes, I always feel like I’m boring, but just wanted you to know that your funny asf and an amazing person 🕺
i just realised how much matt sounds like chris but calmer it’s so nice ily matt
Matt is the sweetest soul ever I love him sm 🫶🏻
had to rewatch and come back to this video, but yeah i fully understand what it feels like to have a sibling then just “not” anymore. im so happy i come back to this video every half-once a month.
pls don’t ever stop making videos
I loveeeeeee how your open about anxiety, and planning to make videos about it! As someone who was practically born with anxiety, it's so refreshing to hear someone speak on it
I think he meant to say a third of him is missing when he is without his brothers.   I would love to see anxiety videos. Also clothing hauls and music.
I hope Matt sees these comments there so sweet 😁🤭
so unintentionally hilarious
Your amazing
we love you Matt💗
Matt don't tell the others but I think ur my favorite triplet
ADORABLE AF
WOW I love matt
2:20 is cute because he looked up like he does in the car videos to look at nic
my sister drinks pickle juice to help her with her cramps.
Take your time Matt no rush everyone loves you and would want you to be ok so no problem of trying to entertain us you already are❤!
Mi muchachito de ojos tristes , te amo niño ☹️☹️🩷
Matt don’t worry everyone likes you we  will be happy to see more of your content and your not boring ❤
I have anxiety, im happy someone might actually talk about it and maybe understand bc they've been through it
18:20 matt.. my volume was up all the way..😭
You don't sound like an idiot, you're cute and it's okay to be stressed and it's normal, so you're cute and I really love you so machhhh❤❤❤❤❤❤
Matt, you’re such an amazing person and I feel like you’re so honest and I like how you can be so honest with people you don’t even know.
and i have to say that i luv how u r dressing up always luves ur outfits bye
14:08 yeahhh thats so cool i thought im the only one loving that bro u r so relatable <33
I just discovered you guys about a month ago  through tiktok and i am actually #TeamMatt all the way. I am glad that I also found your own personal channel.
He is so relatable to me as a person that has anxiety and attachment issues 😃, dont worry matt u r good
Make a fan edit bout u reaction plz
this is probably dumb but i’ve never realised how similar ur voice sounds to nick and chris’s voice until now
I'm so happy that you made your own channel, it's awesome to hear your thoughts and feelings and your point of view. You are honestly a huge inspiration to me, and I feel like I can really relate to you, and you are just my comfort person. Love you sm matt❤❤ and your not boring
I hope matt reads these comments cuz all of you guys are so sweet 🫶🏼
Matt is my comfort person ❤
OMG I USED TO PLAY THE CELLO TOO😭
Love you so much Matt
I do the trumpet it’s honestly really hard to learn
You cool😮‍💨
matts humor is do underrated lol
This part was so funny 😂 13:25
Can we just talk about how Matt’s skin is so perfect?
Matt saying he has to ✨find a way to make it entertaining✨ bro YOU ARE ENTERTAINING just by being yourself ❤❤
My brother drinks pickle juice,and it's horribly disgusting🤢
This video made me want to cry but in a totally cathartic way😭 I’m 10+ years older than matt but he vocalized so many of the same feelings I have. Literally when he mentioned attachment issues I almost lost it because that’s something I deal with so much but never talk about because for some reason it feels “childish” or something idk BUT for someone as well known as you (and frankly as a man) to talk about it so casually is SUPER validating and healing ❤   Also you can totally have a passion for mental health and be open about your struggles even if you aren’t necessarily in a “bad place”!
you're so NOT boring. listening to someone who is finally saying real things that i relate to is so comforting 💌
I love watching his videos cause i relate alot to matt and hearing matt talk is helping me in a way.❤
Matt is my comfort person as well he deserves the world
Matt talking about his anxiety makes me feel like I’m not alone. I love you Matt!!😊❤
I understand Matt so Well!!
literally i don’t even need like any type of video to enjoy it,  just like him talking and stuff is just great i could listen to him like all day it’s crazy
You can do podcasts of you just talking
literally never related to a person more, so glad I'm not alone lol
Matt is literally my comfort person💘He makes me feel so good ab myself and I love everything about him💘I love you Matt❤️‍🩹
When matt said there's going to be a lot of anxiety talks light up my face
At 2:01 who is that in the back window?!😅
Damn I never realized how much I relate to him
This was amazing but I got scared you weren’t gonna leave without screaming at the camera lmao
so cute😔🫵🏼
as a cellist i’m so proud
Matt is so cute <33
The way he says “our” not “my” or “mine” thinking Chris and nick are their❤ 13:06
i get what he is saying because i also have two sibs
Matt a message for u , I’m Vivya I’m only 12 but I have anxiety and its hard and I don’t have that many people to talk to ab this well I don’t have anyone actually but watching ur vids js makes me feel better and having my fav yt relate to me feels better ❤
Me and you are the exact same person I swear to god. Like… the only thing different is ketchup and the pickle juice thing. I would honestly probably be the one drinking the pickle juice lol
matt helped me with my anxiety ❤️
Can you please make a video of you playing the chello or whatever its called
The thing about rings towards the end I understand kinda bc my friend threw a ball at me and the ring made me brake my finger
he's my favorite triplet<3
Dude i love matt he is so kind and probably understanding I love his personality and the way he talks I honestly get how so many people like him because he's just like really kind  to people and this is a channel where you express your feelings and stuff and I love this channel it's literally so cool My opinion you're not boring i think it is really cool here and when you feel alone when Nick and  Chris aren't there I totally get that because i feel the same way with my siblings
I wish chris kept his pepsi video up, but this one hits different.
He was blowing everything😭😭😭
5:54 no you don't
Okay is it only me is creep out by that darkness cus Usually the lights are on
And your not alone you have us no matter what
Your doing amazing I love you and know matter if you have anxiety or you think that you boring you actually really cool and a lot of people including me look up yo you ❤
Omg I love how much of a genuine person he is! He’s so sweet!
Matt’s humour is so underrated 😂
ik this was filmed like a year ago but Matt is my favorite person ever 💗
I literally started crying when he said that I wouldn’t get interrupted as much cause nick and Chris aren’t her… that broke my heart😢
I literally cried. Matt talking bad about himself made me so sad
I watch this video on repeat and the second vid as well ❤
THANK YOU MATT I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS❤❤❤
I can watch this video ten times bc i love listening to him just talking
I feel you with how sometimes my anxiety it ok like I lost my remote and I like freaked out I and I have no idea why but it gave me so much anxiety
I kind of love this cause it is like a one way conversation and I love it and it is very kind to put your struggles out for so many people to see and to help people
watching this a year later and u have grown so much. im so proud of u angel.
matt, i just wanted to reach out and let you know how much your recent youtube video resonated with me. it's rare to find someone who openly talks about their anxiety, and it's even rarer to find someone who does so with such sincerity and kindness, like you do. i can't express how much i relate to your experiences and feelings. anxiety can really take control of our lives, making it difficult to connect with others or even simply enjoy our own company. it's frustrating and exhausting, but hearing you talk about your own struggles brings me so much comfort and understanding. i know it's not easy to put yourself out there, especially when it comes to personal struggles, but please know that your words have made such a difference in my life. you have a genuine and sweet soul, and you deserve all the happiness in the world. i wish you could see just how special you are to all of us and how much of an impact you have made in our lives. you're so much more than just a youtuber to me, you're my comfort person, someone i look up to and find solace in. you have touched my heart in ways you may never fully comprehend. so, thank you, matt, for being so open and honest about your journey. thank you for providing a safe space for those of us who struggle with anxiety. you deserve all the love and appreciation in the world, and i truly hope that one day you'll be able to see just how much you mean to all of us. i love you sm, and i can't wait to see what the future holds for you.
You are so cringe bro 👍🏾
matt even putting time into this shows what kinda person he is, he’s truly such a sweetheart I adore him sm, and him saying he’s “ boring “ hurts my heart I love matt sm 🙁💘.
Matt is someone i can greatly relate to, and it was so sad to hear him say he was boring. Seeing this a year after he posted it, i genuinely hope that Matt's mental health has improved <3
I love this so much, a year later and this person somehow just makes me feel heard. His genuine way of explaining things just makes me feel so comfortable
Pickle juice is very healthy for your immune system and gives you a lot of vitamins, it’s so nasty to drink but I do if for health reasons ❤
Ilysm Matt I would do anything to meet u
it was not once a month‼️😘
Even though I dont actually know Matt, it seems like he really understands me. Just because of the fact that I relate to everything he says. It just makes me realize that Im not struggling alone. Thank you for making me realize that Im not alone. We love you Matt.
ah i’m new to the sturniolo triplets but honestly i feel such a connection to matt. you’re such a comforting presence and i have no idea how to explain it but you just feel like a close high school friend? i’m sure it’s a lot of work to be posting regularly with your bros and then on your own but i love videos like this where you just go through whatever is on your mind. you’re way more interesting than you think!
U should do a vid trying the drink boba🧋
Matt we love you and your blowing . You guys are my favorite people I wish I could meet you guys but my parents would never spend money for that 😢 I love you guys so much ❤❤❤❤
I need the same journey as you bc my family is loud I’m the youngest I literally do the same 10:05
AW!! 🥺 7:19 nooo lol that’s sad. But, you all having your own Channels is GREAT. A GREAT GROWTH journey for you! 👍🫶
Well I’m just watching the beginning of your video and you actually explain yourself very well.
I think it’d be cool if you ranked your favorite shows because you watch so many!
matt doesn’t know how funny he is even without nick and chris like i was laughing abt many things he said in this vid
YOOOOO MATT BLOWIN EVERYTHING GOT ME 😭😭😭💀🫣
2:17 Oh goodness why am I crying so hard after he said that? 😭😢 in all seriousness I love him so much and relate to the anxiety❤
Please make videos on anxiety because I have it too and it should be talked about
CLOTHINGS HAULS YES
I don’t know why i watched this video but I did🤠👾😵‍💫😃✊🏾😧👹
I loveeeee just hearing Matt talk rlly abt his life without the 2❤️🤍
Matt is my comfort person ❤ and this channel is going to be greattt
Im so proud of u 🤍
Matt you are so comforting I think the same way as you about a lot of things which makes me so happy because I feel like I have no one to relate to❤
Matt omg you are not boring, I can tell you don’t feel the same person, and a bit lost when your without your brothers, and that’s so valid since you grew up with them 24/7 your whole life, but you are also definitely your own person and you just have to be more confident in yourself as when your with your brothers. You should definitely try to find some more hobbies if you have some time alone, that way you can experience something new as just yourself. I can in a way understand that feeling, and personally I found writing whatever is in your mind down in a journal or something can lead to small conversations or thoughts you didn’t know you wanted to talk about. We all have our little problems and you know what, that just means we can grow into better and more confident versions of ourselves. Your not boring you just have to say what’s on your mind with confidence, your such a kind person and have such a unique aura around you that just feels peaceful. You’ve definitely grown a lot from when you posted this and I hope you can see that in yourself aswell. :) <3
HES SO CUTE
matt is my comfort person i love matt
matt is so xutie
well i think that i love your mother to made a really crazy and amazing boys, i noticed about you like the last week and i started to watch your videos and i found you so funny and for me there's no way for you to be boring, like every person have different ideas or hobbies and if u don't have like every day activities or things like that don't describe you as a person ❤
this video is my entire reasoning behind forever being a matt girl pfft
He’s so pretty
You’re so sweet
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY AMAZING AND I HOPE YOU’LL SEE YOUR UNIQUENESS ANF FIND YOURSELF ENCHANTING LIKE WE DO❤
You bring me a lot of comfort and I really appreciate you
He has such a pure soul
You’re so interesting, definitely not boring
I absolutely adore you
I’m so proud of you
You’re amazing
I love you so much ❤
I LOVE THIS
I’m sorry but my favorite thing about him is that he is a full grown man and he is not afraid to talk about his mental health cuz it helps him and he knows it helps others. Like🥹🥹🥹
my life won’t be complete until i see a picture of matt with a chello
Thing's you love and things you hate about nick and chris
So proud of you Matt🫶🫶🫶
I love u matt you did so good for your first video ❤ and your not bored
Matt is not boring if anything he is like entertaining but he gets shut down and told to stfu more than heard also matt and Chris have the best sibling bond then him and nick
Guys actually I was beside matt to hide😂
i love matt with my entire heart, listening to him talk without getting interrupt is so relaxing
Matt was born a triplet coz God knew he would need his brothers to help him with the struggles he would face, like anxiety. I am so happy that he made it through and now is an inspiration for all of us! I'm a year late for this but just want you to know that I appreciate you so so much! Love you, Matt!
I love how Matt is so comfortable abt sharing his anxiety
I get really bad anxiety too I hate it
matt you are not boring, we  love you❤️
Matt you literally deserve the entire universe and more we love and appreciate you nick and Chris you guys helped me when I was at my lowest. Love you Matt❤️
I love you❤
Hi  matt. You are amazing 🎉
Matt is my favourite person on the whole word,  serious, i love you personality and you are not all boring without yours brothers.
"I'm thinking once a month if you're lucky" ( 7:44 ) apparently we weren't lucky 😭💔
I struggle with anxiety a lot and hearing that someone who is famous is comforting and knowing that Im not alone is wonderful. Thank you so much for what you do and you never manage to not make me smile. Im so glad I found the main channel and your personal channel, you guys always make me smile.You probably wont see this comment, but if you do please also give nick and chris my thanks! Keep smiling.
OH MY GOD THE MEMORY THING IS SO RELATABLE
The fact that me and mat are so relatable id crazyy
The end has me dead omg
It's the first time in my entire life that I see myself so much in someone, I understand what you say as if I'm saying it because you do the same reasoning as me. I love you Matt.
Aww don’t worry Matt we’re here for u
I was actually in the middle of a anxiety attack and just watching this made it go down ALOT.. thanks Matt I love you sm❤️❤️
im watching this a year later from when he filmed it and i love matt and your not boring 🥰
Your not boring matt
i love matts energy it gives complete comfort i love that.
Listening to you calms me down ❤
im commenting after so long but i just started having anxiety attacks recently and just having anxiety everywhere i go in public but the sturniolo triplets have helped so much i watch you guys for comfort and you arent boring alone you just arent used to being alone and i have a twin myself and people always say shes the more energetic one but im just really anxious around new people and its gonna get even harder when school starts again
Omg Matt is literally such a good person. He makes me feel so comfortable. The fact that he thinks that he is boring just makes me want to give him a hug and comfort him. Also it’s so cute that you and your brothers are so close
Matt locking the door after he saw the man walking behind the car had me in tearsss tho, literally me 😭😭
i love you so much matt, youre valid and we accept you and we love you just the way you are 🩵🫶🏻
I get anxiety when I go in different showers 😅 I cried when I went bare foot into a changing room after going into a pool. 😂
lmao the intro
Listening to his voice is satisfying for no reason, I love him 🤍
I have the same problem I’m attached to my family and I have anxiety and adhd
we loved this matt  keep being you 🥰
matt alone and being vulnerable 🥹🥹🥹 needed this and i need more
I love listening to matts voice, hes so calming
i actually loved this video so much. it was comforting, i relate most of the things matt has said. and laughed a lot.
I enjoy u just being u !!
Matt don’t be so hard on yourself you are amazing and you have so much worth as your own person you are amazing in every way possible and this video really helps me when I am in a bad place and having anxiety or panic attack
Matt is so relatable! At least to me. I feel like he says all my thoughts and feelings out loud even if they make no sense to lots of people they make sense to me. That's one reason I love watching him and his brothers. They're so relatable by saying things that sound like they make no sense but actually do if you think about. If that makes any sense 😂
Matt we love you so much ❤
LMFAO MATTS EDITING STYLE IS SO FUNNY
I have anxiety to, and that’s good for people can know how anxiety feels
Me and him are so alike like he reminds me sm of myself I can’t
I just love you so much its been a year and I steel come back to your vids every time i feel sad and just feel a lot better after watching. Youre the best matt and I really mean it
On God
matt you’re not boring!!
Clothing hauls!!!!!😭♥️
He is a like someone who'll listen to your shits when you are feeling low and need to ramble it to someone
okay this isnt a video idea but its just because, for your own personal videos u should start kissin the camera again 😭😭 literally would make my whole life
The fact that Matt calls himself boring kinda hurts, i adore him so much. As much as I love Chris and Nick, Matt will always have a special place in my heart because he was the first triplet I saw, the one that stopped me from hurting myself and ending it all.   I love you sm Matt <3
i love how awkward he is without nick and chris. it's like they need each other to survive.
Matt seems less quiet on his own he’s got a charm to him, I completely disagree matt is great on his own!
I love the little texts in the middle of the video with the interruption music it lightens up the mood so much and I love rewatching
my comfort person
Anyone see how bro locked the doors when he saw that person walk by? I thought that was funny, ik this is like a serious video but I thought that was funny
Here’s a video idea you  tell us what it’s like being a triplet
He will never know how much this brightness my day🩷
At least he doesn't deal with depression. (I hope)
Make more videos! >>>>>
matt, i struggle with anxiety and overthinking everything i say too, and you are like my comfort person within that topic and i thank you for that.   Also, take your time and say what’s on your mind, be yourself, and now hearing you talk more and getting to know you better through this channel, i can say that you’re a really funny person, don’t let anyone take that away from you or tell you other wise okay? (You probably won’t see this, but if you do, everything i just said was really genuine)
you’re amazing and im so proud of you ilysm
this is so cute i love this and i’m so happy for u
I like the clothes idea, if your comfortable doing it and the fans Will like getting to know your style and tastes better
Watching this vídeo again and going thought the coments to remind thats this losing track is normal and you amazing alone and with the time you' re gonna get used to talk about everything normaly in your own special way.
It's insane how i love you Matt!❤️
I love Matt so much he makes me feel so much better
I enjoyed every second of this, can’t wait to see more! Keep it up you’re awesome❤️
watching this video now makes me just want to watch more matt talking videos bcs hes just so calm and one of the sweetest people to listen to. i wish matt knew how much people dont really care if hes boring or not (not saying he is ❤) but besides that, matt is an awesome person and can entertain people in any way whether its playing games, doing a gna, or even just speaking his heart out
ayoo you is whatttt
15:06 my sister drinks pickle juice and it's so disgusting
My comfort video🫶
I understood everything he talked about even tho he thought no one would. He’s so understanding and sweet and I love that he gets to show his personality in this. Love you Matt ❤
i love you
POST MORE, the relaxed or what you call “boring” videos are actually such a comfort
BRO MY SISTER DRINKS PICKLE JUICE
The random f bombs are what I think In my head 24/7 when I can’t think of what to say to people, it makes it super relatable. Thank you for talking about anxiety as someone that has had anxiety probably since the 4th grade.
the talking to himself in the random texts on the screen :,) <333
14:00 *as a cello player I feel more motivated to practice my cello*
He is so open to us and I love it❤❤ BUT PLEASE STOP WITH SAYING THAT YOU ARE BORING BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT❤❤❤
I love how he says it so dumb and boring cause he can speak what he think and that is what I wanna be able to do, I really look up to him.
i watched this video and i got it that im very similar to him
can’t believe this has been over a year since this was posted feels like yesterday
matt is so my comfort person, idk how to explain it. and for him to say he’s boring without his brothers is crazy, and so not true, i love him so much, and so does everyone here watching!
I LOVE YOU AND YOUR AMAZING MATTY BEAR LOL
I LOVE THE RANDOM CAPTIONS OF POST EDITING MATT LMFAOOO
I love u matt!! And you're not a boring person. Ik I might be 1 year late but i still care. Tbh if u need someone to talk to ik I'm just a fan but I'm a great listener and give good advice. Kinda like a therapist but not at the same time.
Matt make a mother chill video like this one. Just talking and updating us on life. These are the ones that people like the most as you can see lol
I related so much with matt  when he talked about having attachment issues and explaining it like, having two siblings and then not, because my two older siblings both moved out a few years ago, and I felt so alone, cause my parents also was divorced, and I just really felt like an only child
0:14 “oOh there we are ☝🏼🤓” omg
I’m going into 11th grade and when I was in 7th maybe 8th I had a really bad anxiety attack and it was more towards my mom so I stupidly let my anxiety take control and some of it was anger because I have anger issues and I told her that I hated her so I know what anxiety is with anger issues 😅
Idk why but I love matt sm he reminds me so much of me and he seem just soo cool in a chill way
I can relate to you so much 😢❤️ we love you so much Matt
Matt don't ask me not to depend on these videos
the other video idea was a jewelry haul
first video!! you did amazing!
I was NOT ready for when he said "subscribe baby" I CAN'T HE'S SO CUTE
Hi Matt just letting you know I love you so much your my comfort person I relate to you so much t Words can’t explain how much I love you
I literally hugged my computer when he said he was boring. it made me so sad. Ilysm
Watching this a year later, i hope Matt has found some confidence and independence as they've grown on so many platforms. I feel like it's so normal and expected to have the codependent relationship (and the symptoms of it) that Matt describes with multiples (twins, triplets) especially when Chris and Nick seem to have more of the "dominant" personalities (growing up and now). I hope Matt knows his experiences and struggles make sense given the dynamic he's had with is brothers for his entire life. There's nothing wrong with him and things can improve even if it's hard. I'm just sending so much love to him
(I hope Matt read comments and realize how much we love him) I watched this again today and couldn't stop smiling throughout the whole video. Matt, you're amazing and you make us happy always. So please make any kind of video whatever make you feel like yourself. Love u:3
DONT CHANGE THIS! I SERIOUSLY LOVED THIS VIDDD ❤ ITS super chill and relatable 🥰
you are amazing! keep creating content, you will only get better:) try not to worry about the opinions of others because you are doing great!!! also we all love seeing you and you will entertain someone out there so just keep creating and don’t be too hard on yourself. you aren’t “boring” you just compare yourself too much to your brothers. you as a person are clearly entertaining; just look at all the supporters you have :))
Literally crying, bc he is so relatable and such a comfort person. Love u❤
IT IS SO FUNNY because my mom says not to watch videos that say bad words i but the start WAS SO FUNNY
I love you Matt ❤❤
omg me and Matt were diagnosed with anxiety in the same year <3
Amazing
I binge watched all of the Sturniolo Triplets videos, and I can't pinpoint exactly what, but I have a gut feeling that Matt would be great at painting. I struggle from bad anxiety as well, and when I was younger, I was really bad at expressing myself through words. So I started art therapy. And it changed my life, honestly. I think it could be a good idea for Matt to try it and show it to us while talking about his anxiety journey (talking about this topic while doing something else it's always easier, at least to me). I mean, he started suffering from it at quite a young age, and I think it's very brave of him to share it so openly. It's just an idea, hope it makes sense.   But seriously, he's such a kind guy, I hope he can give himself an opportunity and stop considering himself boring. He's a fundamental piece.
I love the way he seems like he wants to talk about his anxiety because it really helps me cope with mine
i miss u come back
the edited caption things u put in here got me cracking up, u funny 😂
I have really bad anxiety too So you are not alone
it's crazy how much I can relate to him, it's even comforting to find someone so similar to you
Matt is my comfort person, I love how he opens up about his anxiety and it has truly helped me with my anxiety. He has also helped me become a better person❤️
matt is amazing,he is my comfort person,and when ever i’m sad or mad i just watch videos of him❤
matt, so many ppl think your not boring. your an amazing person!! you are everyone’s comfort person!! you are amazing!!
I feel like Matt thinks that he’s so boring and nobody wants to watch these but a lot of people like these and think they are interesting and love to watch them
you’re my comfort person
i cant wait for others videos
5:30 so relatable
this is very entertaining
All yall girls thinking matts just talking  y'all
I love how matt opens up to us about what is going on in his life. He's very calming to listen to, but it's very sad that he thinks he's boring or weird by himself. I love matt you so much!!❤️🩷
so proud of you 🤍
4:52 I get it! I’m not a triplet but I have to sisters ( I’m the middle) and my older sisters abt to leave for college next year and it has emotionally hurt me so much to imagine not having her in my life, especially because me and my sisters are like best friends:((
I come and watch this video probably every month and it makes me so happy. I love you matt❤️❤️
When Matt said he was a boring person alone, I felt terribly sorry. He is the most delicate person I've ever met in my life (thanks to videos). I'm very happy to see him smiling in the videos with Nick and Chris. This is the best view in the world!💗
Matt is my favorite out of the three and i relate to him so much and i think he deserves the entire world because of how nice he is and he just has the biggest heart and i love his laugh. I also have a question if you see this, weird but whatever. Do you guys like ever get tired of each other and is like that why you guys made your own personal accounts? Just somethin i was wondering about.
I feel like you dont have to entertain people like thats not something you're born to do ykwim like its cool if you're entertaining but thats not neccessary like you can just  sit here to talk about things and we would still enjoy them and I think you have a great personality,you're funny too, and I'm really happy and grateful that I got know someone like you<3
this video was so comforting to me
you really have seperation anxiety with nick and chris but youre so real and its really fine to have those emotions its okay like i feel that way too a lot
Just hearing you speak about anything makes me happy
The scream can be your outro😂
How do you dm and what is it
You said coustraphobia again instead of claustrophobia no hate just funny how you said it in another video before it was just funny to me but I love you so much and you should definitely keep making videos fs
He sounded A LOT like nick in the beginning 😅
omg the ring thing is so real
Matt is soo sweet !
I'm not a triplet but I'm a twin so I understand ☺
I relate to him sm
❤ I love you Matt!! And I also struggle with anxiety. And understand! Glad your opening up lol
he’s so me😭 like i relate to him SOOO much. i wish he knew that he wasn’t boring and is actually very entertaining
Matt I’m so proud of you💗 I love you so so much and I love when you post anything😚
Luv u Matt
i love u pls continue these videos
i relate to him so much
❤❤❤
Awww Matt you’re not boring 😕
I am one of a twin too. It’s crazy because I wonder how many triplets and/or twins watch the sturniolos.
I love seeing matt like idk how to describe it but being more individual instead of only seeing the triplet videos(still love those but) I feel like you get to see them more as their own person instead of “hey the triplets!” Yk (not to say you’re not your own person but yk I hope you get what I mean 😭 <3)
“I’ve been chillin, no need to worry about me. *short pause* on god” LITERALLY FAVORITE QUOTE EVER 😭😭
matt i love you so much.
It broke my heart when Matt said that he is boring.He isn’t boring he is entertaining and VERY COMFORTING he is my comfort person and I love him so much and I’m so grateful for Matt ❤
Dude matt is not boring.
idk why I just found out about his channel but anyways Matt is so entertaining and I love hear him talk so I hope we'll get more videos in the future
i also have anxiety and i was always got called a pick me but i just like to open up myself to my close friends and i also share my experiences. life is just hard 💀
i CANNOT believe that it has been one year since this video.
3 days late to this vids birthday lol I love you Matt❤
1 year later and I love him so much
happy one year on this video!!!
It makes me sad that he thinks he not interesting when I’m reality he’s so amazing in his own ways I love him so much
It makes me sad that he thinks he not interesting when I’m reality he’s so amazing in his own ways I love him so much

LOVE U MATT. You aren’t boring at all
Hi Matt, I was really glad to stumble upon your personal channel, thank you so much for making these wonderful videos🫶🏽
14:20 Yeahhh these memories wouldn't be remembered without being preceded by another one.
The video title should be "me not getting interrupted by my siblings for the first time"
the way how we're basically the same person internally is insane
matt trying to figure out how to focus the camera is the funniest thing
awww matt!! honestly, i find you to be so relatable. i have anxiety about the littlest things too so i know exactly how you feel! also, any content you create will be awesome to me. you are so funny and sweet and you definitely aren't boring without nick and chris! i love and support you so so much! keep being amazing <3
We love you Matt!! Your doing great!!
I feel like nick edited this
Im new to this community and this video is 11 months old and you probably wont even see this. But I still hope you do, Matt. Obviously, we're all here watching these two old videos because we are interested and we wanna know more about you. I think this is a great opportunity for you to just do your thing, do what you like, do things you've always wanted to or try things that you'd never thought you would even do. Aside from what us viewers want, you need to take account of what YOU want. Your content can only be enjoyable for us, if you enjoy doing them. You mentioned that you're not really good at gaming, whether that's true or not, it doesn't really matter. You don't have to be good at it for it to be entertaining ykwim? I mean, who knows? maybe by continuing to do so, your viewers will get to see how you improve your gaming skills and skills in other things. I have siblings who have all moved out and watching you and your siblings made me feel less alone at home. I enjoy your content as triplets, but I think I can speak for everyone in here when i say that I wanna see more of YOU and your creative mind. This is not meant to put any pressure, this is just to encourage you. Do things at your own pace, we'll be here to support.
I honestly love these videos.
I have a identical twin and i have anxiety and she doesnt so she doesnt really understand what i mean shen i talk to her about my problems 😢
im so much glad that i saw this vid, ur not boring matt, i think you are actually entertaining, i love you so much and i cant wait for other more videos of u💞

matt talking about anxiety and feeling like he doesnt know what to say is genuinely so comforting
I relate so much with him and this video makes me feel safe and calm, because if this is exactly how my mind is❤

Matt makes me feel so comforted and when he talks about anxiety I love it because people don’t talk about it that much and don’t bring it up because ik how it feels because I have had anxiety for 3 years now
matt🫶
The CHELLO!?!?!? 👌
🫶🏻🫶🏻 no words just 🫶🏻
<3
matt, you’re such a wonderful and funny person! i really enjoyed this video with just you <3 i really think talking about anxiety would be so great and would help a lot of people struggling with it as well (aka me!!). you nick and chris are my comfort people and knowing you and i have something like that in common makes me feel more connected to you. i just know you’re gonna do great things with this channel, don’t be so hard on yourself ): i love you <3
Matt is my comfort person he is the reason I'm still here. When he talks about his anxiety it makes me feel less alone if that makes any sense. I am 10 but have already been through a lot and watching Matt make videos makes everything better.
Matt is the reason I can live with anxiety he is the reason I'm here
I Can relate sm too Matt  Having anxiety and social anxiety and being the oldest and I hate driving unless someone is with me  I refuse to drive alone cause I get so anxious this video made me feel a lot better thank you
I’m imagining Matt telling this version of matt from 10 months ago about him going on tour, reaching 4 mil with his brothers, and having almost half a mil on here and it’s making me tear up 🥹 I love him so much.
I wish Matt could see himself the way we see him ❤️‍🩹 this video is such a comfort to me
I really understand and can feel everything he says. It’s so raw and really touches my soul. I feel so much less alone because of Matt ❤
What !? I wanna watch you play video games!!freely I can watch you do anything because you feel the most real to me not saying nick and chris her fake and what's not. Keep going Matt!!!
Welcome I hope you are healthy. I don't know why you have an anxiety disorder but I also had it when I lost my sisters when I was 6 years old and now I don't like being attached to anyone because I feel like if I love someone they will die. Do you understand me, that's why now I'm trying to get rid of this anxiety and you try too please, because now I'm 15 years old, and no one wants to listen to me or sit next to me because I don't want to be attached to anyone, and now I regret something. bye<3
13:43 Imaoooo
13:22 🤨📸📸
I watch his videos every time I feel stressed and he helps me alot
“Sidekick 100% because if you fail you don’t let as many people down.” That was probably one of the most relatable things he said in this video| 15:36
Matt!! I’m so sorry I am seeing this so late!! Listen to me and everyone else in the comments when we say YOU ARE NOTTTTTTTTTT BORING!!!! WE LOVE YOU AND YOU ARE JUST AS FUNNY AND ENTERTAINING AS THEM!!!!!!!!!
the fact matt called himself boring hurts because he isn’t he’s so entertaining the fact he opens up to us is just so relatable i love you❤🫶🏼
aw Matt we love you so much your not a boring person at all I love you <33
hi matt
i litrally love him so much x 🥰
I have NEVER realated to someone more
Mat you can also just literally film yourself in the car while eating whatever it is that you like to eat and talk about anything like even about your favorite food or whatever random thought comes thru your head while you do it. Just chilling dude.
Matt you can do a skin care routine video. Thrifting videos etc. You don’t even have to go crazy on topics, just record easy things that you like. I honestly love these car videos as well. You can also just record from your Room. Talking about whatever. Just make it easy for you that you can actually upload More. Well good luck on this Chanel dude! Loving it!
please make a video abt anxiety it would really help me
matt why the little caption damn i was blowing on everything  im scared
Miss u mattt
I know what anxiety is like because I have really bad anxiety and it is not fun.  Matt you are not boring if everyone in the world was the same the world would be boring. And I have anxiety I don't have a twin but I have separation anxiety to from my sister and my parents like i can't go to a doctors appointment without my sister there with me.
Video started and he say ×3  velcome my personal youtube chanel in 1 minutes 😂
You held my attention for 18 minutes and 21 seconds
“On ah good day” is crazy 😂😂
killin it!
Ur not boring 😭😭😭 i enjoy ur vids so much 😢
“ I don’t know how on gods green earth you would have done that” ~ Matt sturniolo   That is the best thing I have herd all day. This made my week, love you Matt.
Bro, u aren’t boring, ur entertaining with or without ur brothers
Bro ur majestic! Ur the most handsome and amazing hearted person I’ve met ❤
for anxiety try paxil  (paroxitene)
i want to see u talk about your anxiety too cause i think i have anxiety too but like in the social part. im scared of human being. of course i don't think i have such a extreme or so heavy one like other people but watching u can def help me a lot to figure out myself if this is just a exaggerated thing. i totally understand bro. if i don't have any classes, i would just wake up and play games, or watching yt, or watching movies, surf social media, eat, sometimes sleep and then go to bed. so basically i do nothing in my a day of life. seriously, im not even have friends bro. after classes i will go straight home and continue all the same things again. like all the things i do in a day of my life isn't even relate to other people at all.  so really, my life is so boring too that it totally makes sense to me when you said u don't do any activities that entertain enough to talk about. im actually a twin. just like u are a triplet. so beside all the things i do alone i will just do anything that my family tell me to do. i didn't even play any sports at all back in highschool or even before that. all i did is studying and then went home. and yeah when u talked about create your own channel so u may learn something, i got it too. like since last year i entered my uni life, it's so scary bro even till now cause im still uncapable to make any new friends but i had try to join in some discords to communicate and talk with people.  i feel like myself is such a useless somehow but im still so scared to really go outside my box. i did went outside more than just stayed home everyday. like every single days. though it was for some events i signed in for school but yeah still worked. 14:31 it makes sense dont worry 15:42 yeah bro i think so too. totally normal to think like that. to me. 20230315
Love you
ur so real i love you
It feels like were on facetime and i love it
14:02 - OMG I was a wizard at the cello 🤣🤣🤣
Absolutely no hate whatsoever but your anxiety shows even when you don’t want it to
The scream at the end made me giggle 😂
Your my fav person in this whole entire world matt. I hope you see this and if you do then what’s your fav animal?
love the ending 🫶😂
You should do a skincare routine ❤
Kiss me
matt we love you so much you make us so happy thank youuu❤
Just spending my time watching this Gad made me happy eating chocolate digestives and watching Matt is fr a need constantly when I’m feeling down. Matt Literally don’t know how much I appreciate him 💗
I hate it when matt calls himself boring he is one of the funniest people I watch he is so loved and  I can feel connected with him when he talks about his anxiety, he is such a kind person and I love him
this is the best video in the world
This is literally my comfort video I’ve watched it over 100x by now
Boring? Entertaining when you talk, live, just being in the videos still makes it amazing.
I’m so late, but just know that you aren’t boring at all! This vid was perfect. I love u 🫶🏻
How he misses his triplets <3
Bro help lock the door when he saw the guy walking in the background
Your not alone I love you sm Matt ❤️❤️ I have it too
Matt is so comforting I love him so much ❤❤, and also I have bad anxiety.
This man is so adorable
YOU BORING? that's rich
You don't need to do anything in the videos just hearing your voice talking and trust us is just a comforting thing actually thank you for being yourself in this video, love you <3
Invalidated emotions?
I have anxiety too. It's hard to pinpoint why the fear response is triggered so much. Perhaps some subconscious wounding or some trauma from the past, perhaps some cyclical thought process, ie story that we tell ourselves about what's going to go wrong etc. Hard to say. It's almost a personality trait at this point lol a shitty one
Ik this is a very off topic but THIS VIDEO LITERALLY WAS RELEASED ON MY BIRTHDAY
WE NEED PRANK WARS PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE START A PRANK WARS WITH NICK AND CHRIS
WE LOVE YOU MATT
Bro I'm only following your personal channel just cuz your my favorite out of all of you guys. Btw you're not boring.
anyone else notice at 2:00 he looks in the mirror and sees someone walking and so he locks the car doors, bless him 😭😭😭
I love Matt I have anxiety too it’s something that needs to be brought to life
Thank you
Write me a poem. Tell us what your fav historical period is.
Spelling bee was hilarious. Capable hmm? As opposed to incapable?
What are you capable of? What is anyone capable of? What is humanity capable of? What is the mind capable of? Lately I've had more endorphins so that's different.
Its almost as if I can't tell anymore what's more important, my personal identity or struggle or the minutia of my personality and my fear of dropping off the face of the planet without being known. Or if my ideas are more important. Or if solving problems in the world is more important. I used to think learning was the most important so I went after knowledge, but then the bible says I can move mountains but if I don't have love I have nothing. So
i love you matt, you saved my life
The person  walking behind Matt at 2:01 scared me so much
I’m like really fcking late but, I rewatched this video and I can’t get over that you’ve played the cello, my sister played the cello till 2 years ago and I play the violin for almost 10 years now and I’ve been hesitating to quit it but I feel like I’m just so far already and this is a once in a life time chance that I don’t want to give up iykwim
Hey Matt, i just want you to know that you and your three brothers have always put a smile on my face whenever im down, and i just want to tell you that you are not boring at all, and that i love you and your brothers so much. ❤❤
Thé little scream at the end😂😭 18:20

3:09 had the same vibes as "wherever you go, there you are. And wherever you don't go, don't try to escape because wherever you don't go, you're not." - MaryLou
Matt your amazing ur not boring
I wish he wasn’t so like insecure because I know there are so many people that love him so much and need him to be happy </3
Matt ur not boring at all ur a funny kind and amazing person and I love the videos cuz it’s peaceful and jst keep up the good work Matt
I love Matt and if I'd say ur boring than I am even more boring person, and I am not saying that, ur not boring, I really appreciate you and what you do.  Matt is genuine amazing and kind, carrying person PS Matt: I'm probably sounding like an idiot Nick: yes you do 🤣,
this video broke my heart :( .
4:33 he’s so precious help
I like this vibe video as talkin with a friend we need new videos ✨🤝🤍
You’re amazing Matt <3
i love u so much matt
I just wanted to let you know you are not boring at all. You are pretty funny 🤍🤍
actually, I was laughing out loud during the whole video because of how relatable you are Matt, so never say that ur boring again cause trust me, ur not 🫶🏻🫶🏻
I play trumpet 😭 and trust me it's okay to not know fingerings, half the kids in my section dont.😭
Matt, I love youuuuu!
I need to talk about something and i think this comment section would be like a safe space or wtvr. So lately I've been pissing everyone off, people in my school, people at home a little less tho, my favorite rapper/rolemodel blocked me, basically I've js been a really horrible person lately i think. Idk. I'm just really clueless about everything right now. If the person i looked up to felt the need to block me out of their life, why doesn't everybody feel that way about me? No matter what i do history always repeats itself and i end up getting hurt again. And it's been happening so much that I'm starting to think I'm actually the problem. I'm the thing that's causing myself and people around me so much pain and upsetting.
love you  matt
Hey Matt 👋 I would love youtube videos about anxiety as I think I have really bad anxiety and I feel Like I would be able to relate to someone. Also, you could do vlogs that still have nick and Chris in the they would just be about you.  I want you to know that our not boring and you and your brothers are amazing, continue to make amazing funny videos and I love you all.♥
Matt, you are the most perfect person I have ever met in my life. You are never boring, you are amazing. I am happy watching you, even your smile is more valuable than anything else. You work hard, you get rewarded for your effort. Love yourself Matt because we love you for who you are. i love you amazing boy🤍
The second you said “there’s gonna be a lot of anxiety talks” lit a smile on my face. I struggle so much with anxiety and recently it’s been getting worse and I feel like I’m literally trapped. I’m so afraid of being alone and I basically have been recently. I love you so much and you’re an amazing human being. You Nick and Chris all being here and just making us laugh distracts me from everything and takes me away from the severe and crushing anxiety and stress.   Thanks so much Matt. Listening to your anxiety talks will help me so much and I appreciate you so much 😭
ily matt
“damn i was blowing everything” that was under rated💀💀
So crazy how this video has 1.2mil views
MATT!! I'm so late but talk about your fav movies/tv shows/franchises/songs/artists etc. just the things that you like and what do you like about them. if you want. love you and proud of you.
I could relate so much to Matt because I also feel like I’m boring 😢 and not fun to be around bc I have low social battery
I could listen to him talking anything for hours actually
LOVEE YOU MATT<33
2:00 the way he saw that person walking then locked the doors😭
Your not boring your so fun and sweet you always care about other's :)
Love u matt🥺❤
4:57
You no are a boring people foi a such pretty cool people dont say that!
no offense but the ppl that are sayig hes not boring,like how do you know you dont live with him, i dont think hes saying his pesonality is boring i just think he doesnt go out much especially without his brothers so its kinda hard to vlog stuff and make it entertaining, im no being a hater at all im just speaking truth
Matt i hope you know you're a very comforting person
stop calling yourself boring, not you're not. you're definitely comfortable person 😭
I love this channel because I get to hear you talk uninterrupted. ♡
you make me feel comfortable and you don’t drain my mental energy (that sounds odd but it’s true).
I hope he will understand that we love him so much and we'll never get bored while whaching him 🥹💓💓
definitely anxiety things cause i struggle with that too and want to do more about anxiety on my channel too!! love you!!   edit: you should do shorts too
This is my second time watching this and omg I love him sooooo much 😭
Back with the screaming 😂
you aren't boring at all matt and we love watching your content whether it's just with you or with Matt and Chris. you're amazing and we're all so proud of you!
i love youuuuu starboy
i swear this man is a walking mood
your definitely not boring your so funny!!!!
He's such a beautiful soul
Matt needs to know that to us he's a very fun person and he isn't boring at all he makes us smile and makes us laugh and he's an intertaining person.
matt is the most real person.
0:14 🥺🫶🏻
Watching you talk about yourself makes me understand myself better and better. Like I have the same behavior as you do and it makes me feel NOT alone, and knowing that there are people going through the same stuff is really calming. E.g. I don't usually finish my sentence out loud bc every time I got interrupted with my friends and that made me finish it in my mind. Thank you, love you🤍
I like these talks! I want to see more of you for sure because i feel like in videos Nick and Chris always steel your spotlight but ur an AMAZING person on your own. I love you just being yourself and talking to the camera. No matter how much i love Nick and Chris, these videos of you alone just talking or doing whatever is so comforting and i'm happy you decided to do this 🥰. Sorry if this came out weirdly, i know i used your and ur but idc i just hope you can read it. <3
MAAAAATTT You're not boring person at all, dont bring yourself down like that. I really like the way you do your videos, they're just calm and just.. You being you, which is honestly so amazing. I love how you can talk about anxiety so freely, cuz alot of people suffer from it (including me). Never change yourself, we love you just the way you are, and we support you and your brothers, no matter what❤️

This video makes me feel comftrable ❤️❤️
That scream in the end though😀. ✨ Yk when he was like "guys,ik i sound really depressed rn, but I'm literally in a happy mood" Why is it so relatable. I sound sooo freaking depressed sometimes and people are like "are you okayy☹️" I'm like "umm yeahh I'm okay what could  possibly wrong with me" 😭💀 ...  And i really thing, that you should do storytimes! It would be realy nice. Yeah.
The editing is hilarious
"if you fail ur not letting as many people down" i feel that
I think he don’t know and don’t realize how much we love him and how much he is helping us with just stuff like that
Hii<3
matt, i love you omg🫶🏻
We love you Matt❤️
I love you matt, i could listen to you the whole day without getting bored or anything. You make me feel so save because i have anxity aswell and You’re giving me the feeling that I‘m not alone! I really apreciate you and I‘m so greatfull that You’re here ❤️

No Matt you are not boring... Don't you ever think like that..we all love and appreciate you soo much😊💖
I definitely need more videos of you just talking about stuff. You’re great ! Keep going :) ly
i absolutely love the vibe of his channel already, anything the boys bring to the table individually or altogether is gold. would enjoy any of the content you want to put out matt, growing within yourself in your confidence, ideas and just being you. sit downs, driving around, getting real, video games honestly anything you put out i'm sure we'll love
This is definitely one of my favourite videos i think Matt should really talk about anxiety we love u matt!!!
You should try spending a whole day by yourself. I’ve had to learn how to do that myself and I’ve had to learn how to be ok alone and it has helped me so much
i love you. i struggle so much with anxiety thank you for talking about it even though you don’t read comments
"doing it with my brothers"
Matt I think you’re gonna post biannual😂 but that’s okay I can wait
Hi Matt  nice to meet you 👋🏻, i hope you're right 💕 to be your first vídeo  you did fantastic
It would be nice to see you gaming about what you like. I like you😄😁
oh my god matt i love u!!!
Me... Back.... Again...
Matt you are loved! 💕💕 YOUR THE BEST TRIPLET. Like your so sweet and kind. Biggest heart! 😭🥰
I liked the video so much , keep going
I don't know why but listening to him speak and talk about his opinions is so relaxing.
The way I feel for you. Literally I get what you mean when you say you’re boring. Like I don’t think you’re boring and I’m sure you know you’re an entertaining person but that thought of just like not having that much to show for I get you man. I haven’t seen anyone talk about this so it makes me feel a little less alone cause like I feel like I’m watching myself trying to talk to people lol.
idk why you guys find a person saying "I am (such) a boring person" sad like uhm idk it makes me think what's sad about it? that's how i look and observe about myself and still do think it's okay and nothing is sad about it— omg idk if i'm making sense but i hope y'all getting what i mean (i'm also that type of person who calls thyself boring btw)
Hey Matt i know I’m late, i’d really love to see more videos about you. I feel like you understand a lot of things but you keep them to yourself ”cause you feel like….” Believe me it’s not what it’s look like. Free therapy and every words you said are meaningful you have a beautiful perspective of how you see things. I’d love too see you talk more when you’re with Nick and Chris, you smile laugh a lot or zone out you don’t share your opinions more or say things
Babe ♥️
I love you the most Matt. I relate to you the most because I also have anxiety but with very bad depression. I need to stop talking to badly about myself and I think we should both learn that. Lots of love from South Africa ❤
WE NEED A ROOM TOURRR
4:50 I completely agree and relate to this, I’m a girl with two brothers and i have attachment issues with them because they were the only ones there for me when my “friends” left me . I completely relate to Matt during this and understand how he needs them
I just love this video 😭
I watch this almost every day hoping that someday he’ll come out with a new video😭
love u
I love him so much he puts a smile on my face and I was shocked when he said once a month lol I watched this 5 months ago and I'm watching it again ❤
i just love these videos i know the triplets channel is amazing and funny...but i love to see this part of them like...just talking about life and stuff like that ...just reminding us they're normal guys living their lives...this is like the human part...
WE LOVE U MATT ❤
I love you ❤
really looking forward to more videos (when you’re ready of course) take your time. take as long as you need. idk about other people, but i’ll always be here to watch your videos. i look up to you so much 💕
matt is my comfort person. i can’t explain it. i love him so much. he literally deserves the whole entire world! i relate to him in so many ways. he said he was a boring person, and that broke me. it makes me so sad to hear him talk about himself like that. i understand him tho. i feel like that as well, but hes genuinely a kind hearted person and has such a sweet soul and deserves the entire world. i struggle with anxiety too and hearing matt talk about his anxiety makes me feel so much comfort. it makes me feel better about it. i hate having anxiety because it keeps me from making friends, from being able to talk to people, keeps me from being able to be around new people without feeling awkward. anxiety sucks, it really does. it gets the best of us. me and my sister fight all the time but we can’t do ANYTHING without each other. like i love going places by myself. i love being able to get away from the house, but i also hate being out by myself and talking to people. i just hate it. it gives me so much anxiety. i am such a weird and awkward person when i’m by myself. anyways, enough about me. matt you’re an amazing person and you deserve the world! you deserve to be so happy. i wish you knew how special you were to all of us and how much you impacted our lives. you’re my comfort person. i look up to you. we love and appreciate you so much matt and i hope one day you’ll be able to see that. i love you! 💕
i also have anxiety. me and my sister fight all the time but we genuinely can’t do ANYTHING without eachother. i’m so awkward and weird when i’m alone. being alone gives me so much anxiety. like i love getting out and doing things by myself and getting away from the house but going out and talking to people by myself gives me so much anxiety. like i hate to admit, but i hate having my sister in my car with me 😅 but i hate going places and talking to people by myself if you know what i mean. social anxiety sucks. it really does. but something we don’t like to hear, is one day we’re going to have to get used to it and get over it. that is something i cannot do. my mom always tells me how i have to talk to people more but i just can’t. you see two different sides of me. my awkward and weird side when im by myself verses my loud and annoying self when i’m with the right people. like around a whole bunch of new people (school/work/etc.) i’m quiet, shy, awkward, and weird. but when i’m around people i know and the right people, then i’m loud, annoying, and funny. you just gotta be around the right people. social anxiety sucks. i never knew how much i relate to matt til now
can you make a video of how you calm your self down after a anxiety atack. or how to keep the body posetivety up....
“how tf am I supposed to get this bitch to focus” LMFAOAOOO ITS 4;00AM AND I WOKE UP MY MOM BECAUSE I WAS CRACKING UP
I literally adore him, it makes me sad that he doesn’t think he’s interesting on his own:( I find him the most relatable and he has such a calming and kind aura to him. I’m glad he created his own channel :)
17:20 "subscribe, baby"   yes baby i hear you now stop saying you're boring cause you're not ❤️
For a first video it did pretty well. You guys should try to watch it in 1080p, his skin is so clear in that resolution
i refuse to believe this came out 5 MONTHS ago wtff
The way he said I will most every month and it has been 5 months since he has posted 😂😢
Matt:”my first video!”  EHM    You mean your first and last video.
Matt please do more videos like this
i’m so late lol but i think people are pathologising him saying “i’m boring” a bit too much i think he simply just meant that he doesn’t do much in his day so he doesn’t have a lot of things he can upload as successful content. and it’s perfectly normal that he feels out of place with nick and chris bc he spends so much time with them. this isn’t me invalidating his feelings at all but i think he just needs to know that we love him bc he’s matt and he doesn’t do much in his day and that he’s lil awkward. bc i find so much comfort in matt as a person bc he’s so relatable and so real and of all of them i feel like i would feel the most consistently comfortable around him. but the point is that i’m super proud of him for taking such a daunting step for independence and im really excited to see how he feels about this new experience :)
i need the  anxiety talks  ps i watched this video like 4 times already u are not borring matty
please come back😭😭😭
Once a month… 5 months later watching this and uhhh there’s nothing 😂😂 not blaming or complaining tho !
Don't tell Chris and Nick but you are my favourite. And you are not boring
Dude you need to make more videos,I’d love to see some
PLAY THE LAST OF US OR RDR2 OR DETROIT BECOME HUMAN PLSSSS
the necklace story is so sweet! <3
I love you sm, personality and all
I don't finish my thoughts out loud too and I loved this video, I related to it a lot💙💙💙
i love you not getting interrupted by your siblings because the way you talk is just so calming and actually really smart and genuine so I hope you post more videos like this because you deserve recognition as you not just as a triplet!!
i love ur plans looking forward to them!! especially topics about anxiety cuz i struggle too🤍
I love this video!!!! PUT SOME MORE
Alr so I never really knew what it meant when people say "this is my comfort person" I mean it says it all but I never really understood it. But when I discovered about Chris Nick and Matt I realized that whenever I felt sad or mad or just not good emotions I watch there videos, now I finally understand what it means. You guys are my comfort people and I just wanna say thank you for everything you guys do for your fans. I really wish I found out about you guys a lot sooner bc that would have helped me a lot more bc I was just going through sm shit. I'm not rlly the type of person to type out all of my emotions but it feels good ya know? I like to come back to this video and just reassure myself I'm not alone. idk if anybody will come across my comment but I wanna know what can I do to overcome my anxiety and social anxiety, and what are some tips to help me become less anti social? Idk ever since covid hit I haven't been the same and I'm probably one of the many other people that claim there the most awkward person to walk this earth lol.
we need another video😢 we miss you!!!
First of all Matt you are not boring your really funny and amazing and I love watching your videos they make my day better. I would love to see videos where you talk about your anxiety and how you deal with it because I also suffer with anxiety. Ily Matt thanks for making my days better <3
You are not boring!!! we love you for who you are. You always put a smile on all our faces. please keep doing that. ❤
Matt is 100% the best triplet
nah it feels like you have two siblings then they leave for college. They’re still there it’s just weird
this is so podcast vibe bro i could skip this but didn’t cause it is normal and relatable and as a first video that u filmed alone it is epic:)
i love ya matt :) AND hey,  it’s been 5 months since you’ve posted, when will you postttt
❤️
U can  also do pranks and no u don’t sound like a idiot ur an amazing person matt
He always mentions how grateful he is towards his brother
I’m 5 months late and this is still his one and only video on this channel
I’m really glad I found someone who is able to talk about their anxiety,like Matt. I can nvr really talk about it without breaking into waterfalls of tears. Matt is super relatable and just the best human being ever.
This was so entertaining just hearing Matt talk cuz we dint get that a lot I found the little subtitles very funny
me having anxiety is now a good thing because now i have a safe place, also pranks, pranks for sure.
Matthew, you are so precious! Keep doing what you’re doing and even if you decide to change it up we will love you all the same! Live it up, kid!❤
I love Matt's scream at the end of every video 😅
matt você não vai entender isso porque está em português mas  seu canal foi o único dos 3 que eu senti real interesse em checar, honestamente, porque você é incrível e eu amo seus pensamentos aleatórios durante os vídeos e eu queria saber mais deles detalhadamente  te amo muito, você é tão especial pra mim e o “comfort character” de muita gente  por favor traga coisas aleatórias pra gente e eu sei que elas vão ser maravilhosas  obrigada por representar tanta gente falando sobre ansiedade🤍
omg matt i love how wholesome and relatable this video is haha definitely needed this
Still coming bach to this video for comfort till matt posts another one❤️❤️❤️
Hi, Matt! I know this was posted a while ago… like literally 5 whole months ago, but I just recently started watching you and your brothers so I’m kinda catching up with everything. I feel like it was the perfect time in my life to stumble upon your videos. Lately, shit’s been rough. I mean, rough. My brother who I was really close with as kids, died last year at only 17 years old. It took a huge toll on my entire family. I just really haven’t been the same since. The bond between you and your brothers really reminded me of those old days where we’d stay up past midnight and laugh till our ribs hurt. I do have other siblings, and I appreciate them as they are, but nothing beats that childhood feeling. Any time I watch you guys’ videos, I can regress into that time of my life where I had a good bond with my family. I admire it and think it’s absolutely beautiful, the love you have for each other, even when you argue. That’s part of the fun, truthfully. And like I said before, this past year has been really hard. I realized that I’ve grown cold and distant towards my family, especially my other brother who has been nothing but kind to me. I want to become a better person who people can enjoy being around again. I think you guys have kinda started that journey for me in a way. I’ve also started seeing a new therapist for my anxiety, so I hope that will go well. It’s another thing I appreciate about you in particular, Matt. You can talk about that as if it’s the most normal thing in the world, and that gives me the courage to keep fighting. I have faith that I will get better thanks to you. And I mean, the anxiety isn’t just mild, it’s quite embarrassing really. I can barely speak to anyone but parents and siblings(even that can be a challenge). HOWEVER, besides myself, i see that in you. I can tell when you’re nervous and when you feel like you stick out from the people around you. I just want to let you know, If by some miracle you see this, that you’re not “boring.” You have a unique, serene, and beautiful personality that anyone would be lucky to know. You have always stood out to me, but in the best way possible. I love watching you and you don’t have to be doing some extreme challenge or with your brothers laughing the night away. You can just be yourself. That’s enough, really. If you ever do make any videos in the near future, you can count on me being one of the first people hyping you up without shame. You are so special and so loved and thank you for changing the way I see the world in such a short amount of time. Sending you all my love. 🪩💕
The way you speak is so soothing to me, I could watch these videos for hours
Hi
Matt editing is everything😂
He is so precious 💎✨
LOVE UUUU
"I'm so boring" "I'm really not entertaining" sooo why was I entertained then?? I think it'd be really cool to hear about your experience with anxiety and the tips you've learned to help manage it. I also love the idea of a clothing haul!!! Maybe you could show some of your favorite pieces and explain how you'd style them, create outfits, where you'd wear the outfits to, etc? Personally I love hearing about other people's music tastes, so a video where you just talk about current favorite songs, artists, albums, etc would be great imo :) maybe in the future you could even have people send you their Spotify wrapped/Apple replay and you can judge them lol. I'm excited to see what you do next!
Matt, can u talk about ur anxiety and the things that helped u ?
“I’ll aim for once a month I think I’ll be able to handle that” *5 months later* 😂
I know we don’t know each other, but you and your siblings are not boring. You guys seem like nice, cool, funny guys.  Some of the things you were talking about I can relate too. I think I’m boring but when I’m with my friends or with my younger brother I’m more fun I think. I wasn’t diagnosed but I think I have a little bit of anxiety. When I get nervous or overwhelmed my brain shuts down were I can’t think straight and my mind is all over the place. I feel bad when this happens because it’s obvious you can see it on my face and hear it in my voice. I don’t want people to think it’s them I’m getting upset at it’s just me having a hard time thinking. I get more overwhelmed when people get upset at me for no reason when I’m doing nothing wrong. This happens a lot at work when it’s really busy and I’m alone. I feel a little better when someone is with me to help me and have my back. I get nervous asking for help when I need help because I don’t want people to get mad at me. I have a bad memory so I sometimes forget or it takes me a while to get the hang of something depending on the situation. I’m sorry if I’m not making sense I’m not good at explaining stuff.  Off topic but whenever someone brings up a memory I forgot I start to think of so many things I forgot about.
been 5 months😞😞
I’m having fun just looking at you and you are culling your self boring that is crazy 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
matt could literally post a video reading the dictionary and somehow i would enjoy it, this is how NOT boring he is for me i mean i relate sm to him (hoping someday we’ll get another video from his channel)
I would love to hear you just talk about anxiety and your personal experience because in this year my anxiety has been really really bad (I am undiagnosed for personal family reasons) I would always get anxious especially in public as a normal person sometimes would but it’s been really extreme this year. Getting anxiety attacks out of nowhere is horrible but for me personally I absolutely hate it when I’m having a nice day, everything’s perfect and then I would get a random anxiety attack and my whole day is ruined. I’m just so confused lately about my mental health and I would love to hear you talk about your personal experience, if you want! Lysm, your videos with your brothers are honestly so comforting to me. My anxiety isn’t really letting me progress in my life, I’m currently not in school cuz of anxiety so I’ve been just rewatching your videos and it’s the best lol
WE LOVE YOU
i feel like it would be interesting to watch you do mukbangs, where you just talk and eat something
Who else loves his voice?
✨omg im 4 mouths late to this video you are not boring at all. and i love how he is talking about his anxiety and stuff is so heart felt and i love him so much ♥❤‍🔥we love u !!!!!!!✨
I love you
true and raw content on top of everything.
Matt you're cool
Matt your not boring and I love you ok you don’t give yourself enough credit this is a great video I’m so glad that I got to come along with you I know this was probably a little hard for you but just know so many people are behind you and love you <3
When r u gonna post a second video?
I love this video!!!!! ❤ I feel like I definitely can relate to you, I also feel like I’m you when it comes to me, my sister and my neice. Any ways can’t wait for more, even if it’s just you randomly speaking and maybe eating as well. You can maybe just watch tiktok with us lol
You are not boring!!!! Also keep posting you are amazing and have gotten so far. 💗💗
you should do pranks on this channel
I actually find very intresting to listen to JUST you, this video made my whole day
Literally my comfort person <3
i love so much the way matt is really showing the struggle of starting in youtube and self-growth/discovery. Lov u matt so much
actually loving the anxiety talk, clothing and jewelery haul idea
Matt being my safe spot :)
Sending u love kinggg , u have the warmest most comforting energy hope u see urself how we see you 🙏🏽💕💕
Make moreeee
i completely agree with you matt, i think this channel will help you loads! super excited to see you grow throughout the videos as a person and content creator, proud of you!
I kinda feel like a “just chatting” live video would be better for this kind of format (?)
I don’t have like a whole paragraph like the rest of you but I loved this video I love Matt🫶🏻 like I smiled throughout this whole video and Matt isn’t boring at all he’s amazing at everything he does ❤
Matt we would love an anxiety video. I honestly agree with you and the whole anxiety not being talked about in the creator/influencer community because most people think that youtubers and or content creators are perfect human beings when they really aren't you guys go through the same thing your fans do and you should be able to share your experiences the way you want to. Also it feels good to share your story just to get it off your chest and help people you'll also find that your not alone in what you went through and or is probably going though. Sorry if this is too long but yea. I love you so much Matt you make me feel comfortable in my skin and make me feel better about having anxiety.  Thank you so much for just being you. I love you so much💕❤
I love the videos with all three of them but part of me has always wanted to hear more from Matt because I feel like he is such a complex person who doesn’t get a ton of time in the spotlight. This video really let his personality shine and made me love him even more, and I can’t wait to see more from him. Matt has such a comforting presence that he attributes to being boring because he isn’t super talkative, but his energy just feels so safe and like I could be around him and not have to fill every moment with noise. He seems like a great listener which is so important, Matt I love you so much man thank you🥰
we love u so much Matt, come back with the videos!!!!
Would love to see you play a horror game or an adventure type game
awww matt, im so late but this is such a beautiful video. u are definitely not a boring person, ure such a good and fun person i bet!!
being a matt girl is the best decision i’ve ever made.
2:01 when he saw the lady and then locked the door 😭😭 so relatable
I am taller then u 😍🤭🧿(short guys r always chill tho so good for u)
hey matt thanks for hvn this talk i rlly appreciate it and u opening up to us we all rlly love u and support u stay strong and thx for also letting me know that it's ok to hv anxiety
The scream at the end hahah😭 I love you Matt<3

Not gonna lie he's my fav twin 😊😁
I love the little edited comments he makes of him self
I love nick and Chris, don't miss understand, i love them so so much, but there's something about matt, I mean, I feel like my personality it's so similar to his, when he said things like, hope  it makes sense, i was like understanding everything he was saying even though he thought he wasn't being really clear to us, ykwim?
Matt, i already miss ur personal videos, on god. Ever since u made this video i always tell myself someone that's important to me has to cope with the same shit and the fact that im not alone makes me feel so reassured and good. I love how you're so real with us and please dont ever worry about sounding like a pick me again because i promise you, u didnt even slightly sound like that and i got and related to everything u said. Much love
Nooo Matt don’t think your boring your a really nice and amazing person, also i’m so glad your being honest about your anxiety and what you go through.
pickle juice is literally just straight up vinegar ur opinion on that subject was so valid🤢😭
Please make more videos, we appreciate all of you the same! You’re so sweet and amazing Matt ❤
Mattyyyyy ✌️have a nice day 😎
Y’all have no idea how much I love this man!
It's great you want to do talks on anxiety because it is an important subject and I dealt with it alone growing up and I couldn't relate to anyone. Also you are super entertaining and funny Matt :3
YOU’RE AMAZING MATT 💜
I’M HERE TO SUPPORT
I love u 🥺
Does Chris have his own channel?
Matt's comments during the video made all the shit work so well
you are underrateddddd👏🏻 stop downplaying yourself!

I agree with when you say that anxiety is not talked about enough and I love watching peoples personal experiences dealing with it and how they cope. Thank you for making me feel like i'm not alone.

0:01 me to my ADHD everyday 💀

so excited that you started this channel man! i always want to hear more of your thoughts on the group videos so i’m so stoked to hear you uninterrupted🔥🔥
Omg matt.. he may think he is boring but he may not realize that we LOVE him soo much and his personality and smile are the best <3 He is my comfort person and watching the bros YouTube channel helped me get through some tough times.
I’m so happy he decided to do this  I’ve always wanted to know more about him   The way I can relate with things he says it’s just so fun . Im really excited to see more 😊🤩!!
i love him sm
I got my own YouTube channel sometime I get anxiety and I get them  and I Watch your brothers YouTube
tbh when you don’t post for a while it makes it more special when you do. also i love the idea of you talking about struggles as a creator and being open and honest <3
I'm so late to this but hearing Matt saying he's boring breaks my heart because he's not, he's funny and an amazing person with and without Nick and Chris. I just wanted to say I really enjoyed watching this video and him being so open and talking about his anxiety makes me feel not alone since I also suffer from anxiety and I just wish he could see how we see him and that we love and appreciate him so much <3
this video was so comforting and I don’t know why
Matt you are NOT boring at all! You're kind, funny and  also this video was really good
Hi matt i hope that on the rest of you're life is the best even for you're brothers
fuckkk i need more videos like this one matt pleaseee!!!
Matt it’s been 4 months 😭
Hi Matt! Please when you will feel ready, share your experiences of what is live with anxiety is, people like me need to know they are not the "stupid ones", the "losers", the "failed ones", or just...alone.  (Sorry for my English... it isn't my first language) A hug from Italy 🇮🇹
Make more videos ❤️❤️love u matt!
Love you Matt!!! ❤❤❤❤
Matt I love you so much you mean everything to me and you bring me so much happiness and comfort. You are not boring, you are amazing and perfect in every way. This video made me so happy and I could not stop smiling. Hearing you talk the whole time was great and I would love more videos like this. I am so proud of you and how far you have come. <3333
he’s gonna post this month guys i can feel it🤞
He is so wholesome <3
honestly I relate to all 3 of them but I feel like I relate to Matt the most. he seems so shy and anxious and that’s literally me. I struggle a lot with anxiety and attachment issues also
bro you could talk about toilet paper and i will still watch the video i like chill people you got so much of my personality.
I really like matt's calm vibe its really fun and comfy ? If that makes sense
Ur feelings is valid 😌
And it’s okay not to be okay.
Matt we all r so proud of u that u made a great start of making ur own yt channel. It’s rly important to learn something about yourself. Only u know yourself better than people know u. Do something that makes u happy.
"OnCe a MoNtH" so wheres our other 3 videos 🤔😢
oh matt you are so deeply loved
I`ve never realized what a kind human he is and what an amazing friend he would be
I was just watching all of y’all’s and then it like went to yours 😊
I found Chris’s old channel 😮
I love this vid im sorry i really do.
Matt is just so cuteee!!!!
Matt doesn’t realize how much he inspires us or just me to get out of my comfort zone (even tho I don’t do a lot either) and slowly learn how to get comfortable so MATT KEEP THESE VIDEOS COMING I LOVE IT 🥰
Keep your head up Matt, your not boring, you talk about things people are going through and how you relate, not many creators do this, and I think that it's amazing that you do. Thanks for the vid can't wait for the next one 🙂
i come back to this video all the time but mostly when i’m having a shit day, and td is one of those days thx matt for making my day better ❤
I relate myself with you sm that like I could feel your feelings over here idk how but even on the other videos I felt that too. So it's been 4 months since you uploaded last but I'm just gonna say keep doing it, Matt. You really got something special magic thing I dunno. I can watch you talk for ever. Pls do not consider me as a crazy fan ahahahaha Just seeing you good makes me happy. A lotta people over here to support you.And fyi you are not a boring person. Don't be harsh to yourself. Love youu ♡
I LOVE THIS VIDEO SM, I feel like Matt your such a great influence on us and u inspire us sm, I love how ur so open about talking about anxiety and I would love if u would make more videos like that as I also struggle with it and I can relate to you and ur struggles I think it would help us see ourselves for whom we are but we don’t think ur a boring person bc ur quite literally the opposite sometimes I think that I am bc I am a boring person as people always become distant towards me but I enjoy ur content sm and I’m looking forward for more of this talks<3
I wish you knew how special you are to all of us. You, Chris, and Nick have helped me so much. I love you so much and you deserve the world
i was stressing out so i just watched your video to feel better and it did help ❤just listening to your voice is enough ily
Matt you are not boring!!!These words broke my heart You are amazing and we love you❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Matt I love you sm ur literally one of the reasons I'm still alive rn. Ur so sweet and handsome. Just know if you ever feel unloved or upset or anything we love you so very much, we always will.💞💞
I struggle with anxiety for a while now and hearing one of my favourite creators talk about it makes me feel so safe... We love you Matt and you're definitely not boring, you're the exact opposite! I can't wait to see more of your content  <3
Hey Matt you should do anxiety relatables( if your comfortable) and like tips if you have any
اخيراً سمعت مات يقول سالفه كامله لحاله ، حبيته اكثر من قناتهم مع بعض . 💖  🥺Please matt I need more
wait please do pranks
the editing is hilarious
this is the most I've heard Matt talk
Matt, ur literally amazing. Ur not boring—ur a wonderful person and we all really love u very much ❤
Pickle juice is so good 😭
❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂
Us both are pretty much the same preson....... We should be friends
We love u matttt
hey matt come back to your personal yt channel
i hope to see more of matt's solo vids. the group channel and videos are great, but I find it fascinating to see all three of them opening up and diversifying the content like this. And matt alone is def the most interesting to me, maybe because I feel like he has the most to "say" since hes a bit mysterious with how quiet he is in a group setting hehe :) I'd be interested in learning about his anxiety and the way it impacts his work - has being on camera always been okay for him? has he learned to tolerate it only thanks to his brothers? are solo videos more nerve wrecking? I'm sure these are all topics he'll touch up on in the future videos, whenever they may come our way :)
When are we getting another video Matt? It’s been 4 months
Do the anxiety topic for your videos and the clothing haul would be a good idea too. They’re just a start, you’ll grow from it the longer you do it. Just keep practicing doing these. You’ll learn more about yourself and thus expand the content you provide on your personal channel 🖤 you got my subscription at least and this is ONE video 4 months ago 🤷🏾‍♀️
13:06 man this bits the best
Matt i love you so much
This is the first time hearing a influencer talk about anxiety and it helps me feel like I’m not the only one. Your not boring and your really entertaining and funny btw!!!
matt: "i'm so boring" me enjoying this enjoy video and smiling the entire time you're not boring matt i literally love you
that’s so sad your with your brothers all the time, you don’t always have to talk to do whatever you want! Maybe you can bring your brothers in some of your videos!!
Please bring back the 'kiss the camera" outros!!
pls make other videos i rly wanna see you alone more
matthew bernard sturniolo how on earth do you call yourself a boring person? i literally spent the whole video laughing and smiling at myself. i adore how honest and comfortable you seem while talking to us, as if we're actually friends. i also love how worried you were about us being worried with you and kept saying you're fine the entire video lol. last but not least: 17:21 the "baby" had me blushing so hard bye.  wow 4 months late but whatever i would've still said the same things if i'd seen it the minute you posted. i adooore you matt take care🙃💘
Iloveyouuusomuch matt I'm a fan from the Philippines i actually think that you're so cool I'd love to know about you more I'm sorry I'm late and also you look so fine and you're not boring g-night.
We love you Matt <3
Boring? Man I fucking love you! You're not boring at all. You're just chilling. And that's a different shit. I'm really happy I got here. I found your tripletts channel a few days ago. Maybe like a week or something. And I love all of you. But I think you're my favourite one. I mean, we're really similiar I think. So I'm happy that you have your own channel. I hope you'll make some more videos here soon. And oh! Day in life video sounds awesome. I'm sure it would be really entertaing. So yeah. I'm here to say that I fucking love you and I can't wait for more content from you. And now I'm going to watch all of the old videos from your tripletts channel. So bye! Oh and sorry. English is not my first language si this comment it's probably a big shit. Anyway. Love you! Bye!
Soooooo cuteeeeeee
MATT:((((((((( things still shitty didn’t even have time to watch this comfort vid, totally drained;((
Please bring back "kiss the camera" outros for your channel
Omg that feeling when someone brings something up and everyone starts laughing bc of the good memories
3:14 . im gonna cry
Your not boring matt ): your amazing!♡
i love u so much
I love u
whats his mbti omg edit: apparently intp yea i get the vibes
Go for it. Sharing your experiences with anxiety could be VERY helpful to other young people who struggle with it and feel it is a flaw and not a common mental health issue.
you are not boring, i love your personality!🫶🏾❤️
I love matt so much.
I could watch you talk all day and not get bored
one of my comfort videos definitely
I love you so much :’(
It's been 4 months
Matt baby we need a new video please 🥺🥺🥺
this has got to be the most comforting video i've ever seen. i admire all the sturniolo boys, but matt has had a special place in my heart since the very being. i noticed we're both kinda the quieter siblings (i have 4 other siblings and i am the second oldest) and when i found of matt had anxiety too, sooo much clicked for me. anyway, as i was watching this, i saw so many similarities in our behaviors (like how he says "i hope that made sense"  or how he fidgets with his hands and doesn't like to look directly into the camera, etc.) and it made me feel normal. i've always seen myself as a boring outcast with hardly any friends and constant anxiety, but matt makes me feel like i'm not alone and my struggles aren't uncommon or ridiculous. i hope that through the journey of having his own personal channel, he loves himself more and helps others like me to love themselves more as well :)
we need a new video matt :(
The second Matt locked the door as he saw a guy walking way behind the car 😂 This vid bring comforts to me. It's no less entertaining, in a different way. Good job, Matt! Appreciate it a lot ❤ I'll be waiting for your next video, just take your time 🙌
Please postttt I need more of these vids ❤
I hope you post more videos on your channel soon! You’re not boring at all, literally so relatable and comforting
if you’re shooting for doing a video once a month,  maybe you could try something new in every video. like something you’re interested in, could be learning something new like skateboarding or guitar or idk cooking? just something you’ve wanted to try and this could be like an outlet for that if that makes sense. or maybe like a monthly recap, things you’re excited for or favorite moments since the last video. i don’t do stuff like this so i don’t know if it’s helpful but hopefully it is!
i love how he said he will have a lot of anxiety talks. he is such an amazing person and you can tell he's trying. i hope he knows that were here for him. i actually had a massive panic attack last night and i watched ya'lls group videos and it made me feel so much better. we love you matt!! <3
i adore you!! please post more when u have the time, bc u are my current comfort person :] i hope you are doing well these days... very happy for ur guys recent success. (would really appreciate content about ur experience with anxiety if ur comfy with that. ive also struggled with major social anxiety my whole life so i understand how difficult it is.)
i completely understand the having 2 siblings then not because i have 2 sibling and they moved out now its just me and its rly boring :/
matt you just made my day<3
I loved this video! You're not boring at all and I can't wait for more videos<33
I love you, Matthew!!!
I LOVE THIS VIDEO AND DONT YOU DARE CHANGE ANYTHING AND BTW UR NOT BORING ALONE
I love this and anxiety talk + social anxiety
I'm 4 months late but I'm here to reassure you too that YOU'RE NOT BORING, absolutely not. We love whatever you give us bcz it's YOU. And we love you for who you are and appreciate you for it. You're not boring, we enjoy whatever you give us <3
i'm just excited for the anxiety talk fr
i love matt omfg
I loved ur video Matt, it was actually really entertaining lol, I hope you are doing well. Tell Nick and Chris I said hi if ya can <3
The subscribe baby hits different
I loved the video (looking forward to more and no, you're not boring at all!) and also its perfectly focused, good quality and lighting is just *chef's kiss*! Nailed it Matt!
love you and your siblings ❤
0:01 me to myself cuz I'm in university and i literally just can't focus and haven't done any of school works at all
i love him so much.
omg play horror games
Matt: “Do not depend on these videos” yeah no totally not🥹 (I’m heavily relying on this video Matt, it’s my emotional support😭😭😭😭😭 )
“Yeah man yk just another night just another day” 😭😭😭😭 MAAAATTTT comeback, sitdown and talk some random shit🫠
for some odd reason I don’t even know of I had decided to not watch this yt video but ig I eventually did 3 months later. And I might say that I don’t regret my decision at all. You made me laugh and smile especially at the part where you remembered something you thought you had forgotten. I really hope you make more videos. Take care Matt. We all love you
Matt believe me you are amazing and your not stupid or boring for being alone sometimes! Pls believe me you are so strong and  also so funny without trying i hope you know it, love you Matt! And i also appreciate you so much 💜
i need a new video here
Matt could u do a vid about like just anxiety talk?? I feel like out of all people u would understand what I go through the most btw ily ❤
Matt come back and talk about anxiety now:(((((((((( I’ve been watching this to help me cuz lately has been really bad.  Pleaaasseee come back Matt:(
The editing is so funny for no reason 😭😭
driving can be pretty nerve wracking in the beginning. i unfortunately was in a pretty nasty car accident with my mom when i was 17 and it caused major anxiety when i finally got my license at 18. it was def heightened by the fact that a majority of my driving i ended up doing for the following few years was just to my part time job and back, which was only a three minute drive away, so i really didn't have a lot of experience on highways and busy cities. bUt, i'm almost 22 now and i feel a lot better, bot perfect and i still have bouts of anxiety, but i've since taken a few lone, long trips by myself and continuing to step out of my comfort zone a bit when driving has helped.   i'm sure it can be difficult when you're the only one of your siblings that has a license, automatically placing u in the position of driving them places, but don't be scared or feel selfish for taking even tiny trips by yourself.
is this guy some like tiktoker? idk somebody tell me
You’re so cute, Matt.. for real lol
I'm an identical twin and I could pick up on the attachment thing quickly. I'm the older one by a minute and my sister is...like I have 3 types of anxiety because I just can't be away from her for too long. Like she can work and do a lot of solo things, but my mind gets clouded by her and I'll say me, but I mean we because I know that I'm too attached to her. And due to a forced separation when we were 6, it f*cked me up. I'm trying bc I do want to be without her and give her space, but last time I did that it was a private matter and it just f*cked shit up even more, so I get you. I do. Like I can relate to you. Always in the videos of all three of you, just because I get written off as being mean or hateful when I don't talk, but it's just my facial expressions and it's actually because I don't do well talking to random people. Rambling, but I just wanted you to know I understand, but you're a comfortable person to me.
Okay so when y'all are together y'all don't look alike to me but now that you're by yourself I can see nick
😂😂😂😂 can we talk about Matt at the end of the video and you he’s said he is boring he she is not
Matt deserves all the love he's so cute and adorable panda
good deal - young people coping with reality- going thru normal uncomfortable feelings-leading to eventual growth  PEACE MR
it's the little things about anxiety that nobody talks about, I'd love for you to make a video about it coz I could probably relate to it a lot
Matt we love u sm, don’t bring urself down man
i love you.
All of you are very smart and introspective 💚
Love your vibe ❤️😊 very much a Matt fan 🤙
this is like the 6th time i have watched this video i just keep coming back. please make another i love you so much it’s unreal.
God he is so cute and awkward 💀💗💗💗
I have the exact same thing as matt, I always get interrupted so when I get the chance to speak I forget or I get the idea that the people I’m talking to don’t want to listen and  I can’t even finish my sentence. but I promise your not a boring person it was actually really entertaining ❤️
I just found you and your brother's channels thru a Mean Girls tiktok edit lmao.. and i think I found some new youtubers. 👍
Would love an anxiety type video, feel like it would help ppl out aswell as understanding it
This was hilarious and would love to see more tbh
he in fact, was not up to one video a month. 😂
Matt this was incredible!!! I just got here through the other channel, which I just met... I really wanted to hear you talking more, and now that I did I identified so fucking much with you, I had few bad situations with anxiety too, specially during the pandemic, and I know how it's hard to deal with couple of things and do things by yourself and just for you recording alone kinda helped me to be confident that I can get through it!  I can't wait for the next video, take your time and whenever your ready to post again we'll be here waiting for it!  Hope you're fine !! Love from Brasil ❤️
i have a idea for a video: do prank on nick and chris , like say you don’t wanna to record anymore and you tired or something shit like that
Matt needs to realise how much we love him and he should post more on his account <33
woww u look good
this video is so me
matt you are so valid <3
this is so good! it just felt right <3
LMFAOO KEEP THAT OUTRO

i love him so much
anxiety talk is really gonna help me bro 2022 is   s t r e s s f u l   af like i'm tryna live and then: corona war people are deadass out to get me or smt 🤡😋 and oof that was painful?? to hear matt saying he's boring bc ngl i admire him quite a bit :/ [the cuts in between with the music was hilarious 😭] and i know my comment is not as heartwarming as the others but it's better than nothing so :) <3
yeah apparently i saw ur video on recommended (i know nothing about u) and idk how it got there but I'm glad that I clicked.
ugh came back to this vid bc i love me a bit of matthew! he’s such a doll ugh love him
its so cool to see the difference between when hes with his brothers Vs alone, with his brothers its super funny but when hes alone hes real.
Does Chris also have his alone yt plz tell me
I would love the personal/anxiety talks. I don’t see enough representation and it makes me feel super alone. I appreciate you ❤️
Maybe Matt never gonna see this or even see this but never gonna read it and I’m kinda nervous but i feel like i have to write it. I’m kinda new here. I guess it’s been 2 or 3 weeks and i already feel safe, happy, touched while watching these triplet boys. I like all three of them, they all making me truly smile. But when I’m watching, listening Matt i feel that I’m not alone. For a long time and still I’m struggling with social anxiety, anxiety and depression. I have nobody around me having these things extremely high level like me. I can easily understand how he felt when he is all by himself, don’t even need to hear explaining that feeling. I’m going through these things and everyone that i know, even my family think that I’m just being dramatic. (Btw my family trying to help me, they don’t have bad personalities, just not understanding me) So i was thinking that I’m the problem. Nobody ever gonna understand me or even try to understand how i feel, I’m alone.  But since a couple weeks ago, especially because of Matt i know that I’m not the only one who has going through somethings. And like he mentioned before, he helped me to see that these things are not a huge problem that will stop me to doing whatever i want. Matt became my comfort person. He call himself boring but in my opinion he is not, he is never fail to make me laugh or smile. And he thinks that he don’t have that much his own things to talk about it but I’m sure he has lots of things. He is good at paying attention, taking good care of others, comforting them, making people smile and laugh as i see from the videos. These are some of his things as i see. And i love that. Also i know, he is definitely more than that. Finishing this comment, cause it became so long and i don’t even know if Matt or anyone else ever gonna see it or not, maybe nobody gonna read this. I’ve wrote this because what he said from 3:33 to 4:50. Felt that i have to write this cause it’s not fair. He made me feel I’m not alone and not a problem. I don’t think he will but if he see this, Matt you need know that too there is someone out there going through same things as you have. And I’m so thankful for showing me lots of things, brighten my days, also becoming my comfort person. 💜
6:52 i really got that anxiety thing i had no idea other people felt like that and it’s crazy. It’s kind of like “no easy way out” kind of thing like im anxious when im outside of my room outside on some days but some days im not.
This video was so entertaining i can't believe he thinks that he's boring
:)
Dont feel any pressure bubs! U go on on your own pace and comfort. We will be here ❤️  And gosh I relate so much when he said he rather be a side kick than a super hero. Bcz SAME!  if failed we wouldn't let other people down and we wouldn't be blaming ourselves and gettin hurt too..
Not this being 3 months old but him saying he will post once every month
the scream is above and beyond for an outro use that
I LLOVE THIS dont change
You should do rants, or storytimes, things that happen to youo or you think about, maybe something that happend while driving or  anything, Most immportanly Do what U love, not what subscribers like, not what chris likes, not what tiktokerlike not what instagram likes, DO what Matthew Sturniolo Likes
dw Matt seperation anxeity is really normal between twins and triplets, my  cousins are twins and they cant handle seconds without each other, like they must sleep togehter they must sit together, they cant handle being in 2 diffrent rooms without worrying for each other. Its even more reasonable that your a triplet.
this was so entertaining. i’ve always resonated the most with matt so hearing him explain his anxiety and dependence on his brothers was rly cool. i hope he knows that he is very well spoken and that we enjoy content of him alone just as much as with the two other losers. love u mattyboy❤️❤️❤️
didn't expect the ending lmao
i wanted this video to continue so badly
i love you so so so much matt but I love drinking pickle juice out of the jar 🥲
yesss do clothing hauls! i love watching them
you are not boring at all matt
The fact that he said he was boring was so sad to me cuz he is so funny and nice and when he said he going to do alot of anxiety talk i was so happy about it
I really enjoyed it.. you did a great job..love you❤️❤️❤️
1 MIL VIEWS YAY
Do an anxiety video!! What your anxiety is about and how do u deal with that
i love you so so much matt, and i don’t put that lightly. you genuinely make me feel so understood and loved and cared for :)
Maybe a shoe hall
If Matt is boring I’m non existent
this felt like watching my friend’s snap vlogs
Matt: I can manage a video once a month 3 months later….  (No hate ily i just thought it was funny)
❤️
i love how you got more confident throughout the video, i relate to you so much especially about the anxiety so it would be nice if you did  a video about that as well🤍
matt we all love and support you, and were so proud of you. You're doing amazing !!!
sooo where is matttt :)
my favorite mirrorball <3
I love you Matt but if there is no bathrooms how the hell are you gonna pee in a sink. plus who is just peeing in sinks?
I'm rewatching this and god i really think he don't know how much we appreciate him and how helpful this type of videos would be. I'd really love to watch a new vid soon, and btw congrats on 300k ily❤
I don’t have (social) anxiety but sometimes i feel stressed about things etc, and these videos makes me calm down. We love you Matt ❤️
Dude Matt I played the cello too! Sick
لو ماتسكت باكل راسك cute !
Matt you're not boring.
plz post again I love this video
matt you are not boring❤️we love and appreciate you
We Love This!! it's Okay <3 and I'm Really Happy You Have this channel ! ,❤️
I'm Really Late 👍 But I Love This !!!!!!! You Are Really Good at filming? That sounds bad but yeah ❤️❤️
Matt you did such a good job we are all proud of you. I definitely relate to you the most ❤️
Can't wait for more videos from youu!
you're so unintentionally funny at times, I love watching you or just listening to you talk while I do smth else. love you matt
you're so sweet and remind me a lot of myself. to learn a lot about yourself you could try journaling. you can give yourself prompts every month/week/day eg what did I learn, what do I want to achieve, to do lists, what's important to me, what do I like about myself. it really helps me and its shown to help mental health a lot!
It really hurts the way that matt  said he is boring alone
MATT WE NEED CONTENT PLEASEEE
This actually made me relate to Matt so much more, I have pretty bad anxiety but you would never know unless you saw me by myself in a social situation. If I had friends with me you would never know about it. Matt we love ya! This video was very real❤️
I feel like this is gonna be such a good thing for you!! Cause you can learn to have a separate life without feeling so separated and anxious but still continue to enjoy your life with your brothers if that makes sense ??
There’s so much we still don’t know about him or his brothers or anyone or anything on this planet. I don’t know what they have been through to get to this point. We don’t know what’s happening behind closed doors. So I don’t want to judge and criticize because even though they share a lot we still just get to know a teeny tiny fraction of their lives.  To be honest I’d not expect Matt to have his own yt channel but it makes me so proud that you actually try sometimes. Let me elaborate; Matt seems to be more guarded and unlike his brothers he is enable of a different type of quality regarding interpersonal relationships. The way I see it is that you are a good listener, you’re attentive (when it’s about people you really care). You feel things at a different level, maybe so much more intense than you actually show on the outside. I assume that you also think about stuff very critically that’s why you need a little bit more time when you try to express your real honest opinion. And I’m not comparing you to anyone, still I actually don’t know anything about you. But since everyone knows you guys love interrupting each other there is not much room for Matt to fully say everything what’s on his mind. That’s one thing and now I might be interpreting to much and overthinking unnecessarily. But the other reason why Matt might feel anxious or feel awkward when filming alone is his sensitivity and insecurity. I guess that he’s taking things personally a lot but also just by people who are very close to him. For example his brothers, it’s like a two ended sword; on the one side his brothers could be the most supportive, loving and caring people in his life but they’re also the ones who could emotionally hurt him the most. It’s just love; it could be the best feeling in the world but it could leave you completely broken and shattered at the same time.  I’m pretty sure like every other siblings we fight at times and go through a lot of shit. And for some people it causes trauma that effects your daily life. But only just until you realize it and have the willingness to change and improve. And that is the point of this comment. Generally, I see Matt trying very hard to become better and improve (on any topic). Like this video for example. Earlier in this comment I said that didn’t expect you to be the first having a yt channel but you actually do something about it. Firstly, it makes us so proud and it encourages me to do the same to be more open minded and be courages. You knew that when you would start your own yt channel you are going to get more confident in your own skin, in your personality and you as an individual. And I think I know what you meant when you talked about just you being alone in this video and that’s it’s kinda overwhelming at first and obviously feels different when you’re alone. Like empty. because all you ever had were your brothers (exaggerating ik). You just come three in a pack. And since you go out on your own it feels like your a baby animal set out into the wilderness yk? BUT HELLO?! it’s your first ever video there’s going to be ups and downs but eventually you will improve and become the best version of yourself. I know I am interpreting to much but that’s just what I think and I’m open for discussions. But I have no doubts that when Matt becomes more and more his true authentic self, his personality will shape naturally and beautifully.  And one last thing when you asked what we would like to see in your videos, don’t rely to much on your viewers because you will already know what they like once you just upload videos. And please just do whatever you wann do, maybe one day you’ll have genius ideas that are super innovative and never seen before, immaculate and unique haha I mean who knows. Just enjoy the process of doing something and don’t focus to much on the result. That’s what passion is :)   Anyway take everything what I said with a grain of salt lol
do what makes you happy🫶🏻 we appreciate you so much and we‘re so proud of you, that you want to talk about your anxiety❤️
why is he literally the cutest
i relate to Matt so much because i'm a triplet and growing up i was never seperated from my siblings so now i can't handle social situations or anything without them unless i know them really really well. i also struggle w anxiety so matt really helps me!! 💖
the fog on the screen at the end😭✋
u looked so much like nick in this video!??
4:50 dont worry we understand😂😭i have 2 sisters that r twins their only a year older than me so yh i get it🤣🤣
Can we talk for a second about the moment he immediately closed the door when he probably saw that person walking
I cant explain it in other way but here matt is just matt and i love that
This is my comfort I have never related to a  influencer so to have a person say they feel the way I feel makes me so happy to know that I don’t feel alone and someone feels the same way I do, I feel like the most boring person ever and sometimes my anxiety can be bad, and to have my favorite person to feel the way I do makes me feel like I am not alone. I love you so much Matt thank you so much for opening up to us. Love you so much❤🖤
this video was intense and funny and emotional at the same time i really enjoy matt by himself. The three of you have awesome personalities
Matt constantly saying that his anxiety is not that bad is so relatable because whenever you talk about your anxiety you feel like maybe you’re trying to gain sympathy and that there are so many people who have it way worse than you and it makes talking about it so hard cause you’re constantly judging yourself about it.
Matt you should do a shopping spree!! ❤
We love you Matt ❤
Don't call yourself boring Matt you're not boring I'm having fun
waiting for more matt sturniolo channel content
Why do I feel like he‘s a baby I have to protect him from everything. Am I the olny one ??
I LOVED THE VERY LAST PART AHAH i actly related to a lot of the the stuff u talked abt like esp the someone brings up something makes you remember something happy hahah ure definitely not boring to me cos honestly watching you talk made me feel really comfortable so yea ure doing great!
Im a Matt girl. 😋
Don't call yourself boring your literally the funniest . :( 💗
YES PLS VIDEO GAMES!!
dude re watching this a couple months later just is reminding me how much i relate to you on many levels lmao. and i understand feeling like every second you feel like you have to defend yourself when mentioning anxiety and just make sure people aren't feeling bad. i promise u , we love u for u!!! and i love and support everything that u are <3 the good and da bad. alwayz. love u bud <3
as someone with diagnosed anxiety, I feel u and relate to u tbh
I‘d love to see matt do deep talk videos . They are so entertaining and you can get a deeper connection with people on a different level .
if he knews that i only watch the videos with her brothers just to watch him
he reminds me of emma chamberlain <3
Hi Matt, It’s been over 3 months since your first and last post, and you have just under 300K fans waiting for your next post.  What I want to tell you, is that you don’t have to do something that you feel is interesting in order to make your next post.  It’s not what you do that interests your fans, it’s you.  Just plane you, and no body but you will do.  You are an interesting person all by yourself, and only you can share yourself with your fans.  Your fans are eagerly awaiting your next you tube installment, so please give us a little more of your beautiful self.  Tell us more of your hopes and dreams, and of your fears and anxieties.  Anyone can go bowling, or peewee golfing or get a tattoo, but only you can give us Matt.  As Nick said in one of your car videos, Pleeez!
he seems so sweet and kindhearted, absolutely loved that video. go matt <3

NOOOOOOOO. we frickin love you just the way you are and everyone loves your personality matt. i literally loved this video and I'm honestly so excited for the next one. also I LOVE THE WAY MATT SAYS "piture" instead of "picture" omg i love him so much he is so underrated he deserves so much more hype.

i really wish you could post here more
Im in love with u, im not joking.... U r amazing!

Matt is far from boring. I can listen to him talk for hours. Hearing him call himself boring breaks my heart
11:48 PiTcHeRs
You should make a video with your brothers sometime
U said u will upload one video every month...it have been 3 months and u didn't upload anything yet...please upload something i need to see u talk idk maybe about anything...and I will think very hard to come with an idea for your next video 🐳
IM sorry i Ment to like thé video But i axedentely prest thé dislike, IM so sorry Matt it whas an axedent, i love this video and i love what you do, keep it up💗
Why did i not realize he said pee in the sink the first time 😂😂😂😂 men r so funny.. tbh I’ve peed in the sink when i absolutely had to one time but the way he said it sounded like guys do it a lot lmfsooo
Not boring at ALL
pov: you watched this twice bc you like to hear Matt speak
the way he locked the door when someone walked in the background haha literally me
Do a driving video
love you matt❤❤
i cant with the way he said internet omg idk why but that was so funny to me
Amazing no loud nick what a potato
u joint on my birthday
I can listen to him talking abt anything without getting bored for the rest of my life
He thinks he's boring and I'm here watching this video every once in a while because it makes me comfortable , someone should tell him how amazing he is
This is actually sad,matt calling himself boring while i think that he’s a incredible person that always makes me laugh,matt i love you ,keep going🫶🫶 comfort person actually
i completely get what u mean when you said how people bring up memories you almost forgot and it completely takes you back. those are like the best convos
this brings me so much comfort, i feel like we’re having a conversation. i love matt so much<3
You make sense ♥️
Cant wait for his next vid
Matt I literally love you sm ur not boring at all
I WANNA SEE MORE SOLO MATT VIDEOS
Matt literally makes me so happy. Like I can't even comprehend how much this guy has helped my mental health. Everytime he calls himself boring I want to cry. Like he is so effortlessly funny. <3
i hope you will make more of those its so comforting to just hear you talk about your anxiety and being real whit us and i feel like for many people that have anxiety and attachment issues its really relatble things that your saying about feeling boring and not productive to film also i love that your telling more things about yourself this vidoe was so funny !!!! 🤓thank u Matt
I have an attachment problem too bc I have a twin sister, and when we’re separated which is rarely but when we were in school I got anxiety from not seeing her but we graduated so it’s a lot easier to be with her all day
Hey Matt I just wanted to say that ASMR could probably help with your anxiety it helps when I'm like stressing out over maybe just the littlest things I have been getting stressed out over everything lately especially at work but when I come home I watch ASMR videos and sometimes I end up falling asleep because they're so relaxing and calming
Me being so happy cause he actually gets to finish his sentences with Nick and Chris screaming 😭😂🤣
I'd say so much more but I'm not really good at expressing myself so thanks Matt for this video 🌻💙
I feel like this is going to make matt les nervous bec he thinks that he is boring but he is so intresting so matt don’t think about yourself like that ✨SELF LOVE ✨ bye
you make me feel so safe. i feel like we have a really similar train of thoughts. also youre not boring at all i was laughing the whole time💀
❤️‍🩹
Am I the only one who thinks that Matt is the most interesting? Likeeee MATT YOU’RE INTERESTING SO SHUT IT
Whenever i feel down i watch this its like my comfort space
ok this was actually super amazing , you might not think so for whatever reason but you’re super entertaining and funny I enjoyed this vid and I’m sure everyone else did too love you dude  keep slaying😩🤙🏻
SOBBING. “subscribe maybe.. that’d be cool” AWWWWWWWWWWWWW THIS IS ADORABLE I loved this video sm stop

Your AMAZING ❤️❤️
14:31 it does!! I totally get that. Suddenly becoming aware of good memories attached to the thing someone brought is such an amazing feeling. Like wow I'd totally forgotten about that and it's just so cool to remember all these great memories you weren't even aware existed two seconds ago
The fact that I got to know him for him & then found out he has a triplets channel
have so much proud of you kid, love you 💘🥺
You arent boring i was occupied this whole video, I wish you knew how much we love you <33 I also have anxiety and its like yours i have a sister and when im not with her its odd and just not right. (sorry that was so cringy-)
Matt we love you be happy 🥹🫶🏻
you are awesome!!! don't call your self boring you are perfect no worries xx
Matt we need new Video
matt is the first person ive seen saying sun rise over sunset which makes me so happy because i love sun rises so much
I guess you have a very  peaceful and chill vibe.. like.. a nice night talk with a friend. I m going to need more of this shit.
Matt calling him self boring makes me so sad because even when hes alone like this i kinda enjoy it more bc he does not get intoruptet and i just love him bc he's just so sweet and al .
😭😭😭
You are definitely not boring and you are not an idiot 😔
and you are so smart
I love you
“ oh there we are” 😅
thank u for reminding me to take my anxiety meds
I hope you are going to post on here because this could honestly be the shit. You give me Emma chamberlain vibes only the male version.
I would love to hear you talk about your anxiety. I’m also a person with anxiety and I love to hear other people talking about it.
i love matt so much
maybe starting your own channel will help you figure out different things abt your personality that you like- it's just going to be a journey
15:05 HAD ME DIEING BRO
As someone else with anxiety on the daily, the way you're describing it is so funny. We really are fine it's just constant. Lmao
Me everytime the music starts:💃💃💃
You make me so happy :)
Story time type of video , I think you are capable to tell stories in details  and I can listen to them peacefully and it is okay they don’t have to be entertaining
Comfort person>>>>>
Even tho u think ur boring I think all those video ideas sound great and would definitely watch them
who else thinks he should bring out camera kissing🙏
This was so refreshing to actually listen to what matt had to say without him getting interrupted by Nick and Chris lol. he can be so interesting when he gets to say what he wants to say!
Bruh he's so adorable ilh sm :')
back here again 🤞🏼
matt i love you so much.
i have bad memories with cello like my teacher was fucking evil so i gave up yeah that bad and let me tell u, when i found out the teacher was replaced the netx year when i started piano... oh hell no
i love you bro
I feel so proud of him
i think he should try going on late night drives and like vibing to music, or try cooking something from scratch :)
You are not boring 😊
I love you 😘
realest man i ever saw. i love you
I love you and I can’t wait till you make more videos <3 your not boring.
Sorry!! Didn’t mean to dislike I liked it and I love that you’re normalizing anxiety
Missing you so much
HES SO UNDERRATED
I’m so proud of you, dealing with anxiety is hard, no matter what. I’m so glad you made your personal channel, I can’t wait to see how much you get to know yourself. I sincerely appreciate you, you’re beautiful.
the fact matt  thinks hes boring is so fustrating like hes the most interesting person ever 🤣
lets all be honest nick and chris are fucking amazing but matts just the best hes so real and  funny without even trying to be love him so much
come back
I feel like Matt is kinda underrated, like he's deadass my favorite out of all three of them just because he is who he is yk. Like, Matt is cool af. I'm really glad he made his own channel cuz it's cool to see how he is by himself. Loved this vid!
matt is deff my comfort person
You can record a different  videos about the weird  together that you have sometimes , I mean when you have a strange idea you want to talk about. You can record it ,and you can make a video for it when you put all of the videos together and make one good video, maybe it's weird thw but take it 😂👍
Matt your not a boring person I really enjoyed this video. I can’t wait for more videos ❤️
i like the music taste idea. btw i don’t think you’re boring <3
we love u matt ❤️❤️❤️
matt you should make ur "podcast video" about ur scar it'll be so good
the anxiety thought process is so crazy like i drive to newburyport which is like a 35 minute drive every day and i always find something to make myself anxious about when in reality the drive is the same every single day
your not boring you make my day and you have really changed my life just by being in it <3
I loved this because it felt like I was just able to listen to him and we don't normally see that in the videos with all three of them so it's actually really nice :)
Matt I was born with Anxiety Ik how it feels
Mabye, idk because I’m not you, but Maybe you’re trying to say that without Chris and Nick it’s like you are one puzzle piece, might sound stupid but maybe you feel like your not complete without them, which is fine because I feel like a lot if people will understand that Matt xx 🤍
this video is so comforting i feel so connected w u and everything i always come back to this vid when things get bad because its so much of a comfort to me, matt ur so genuine and u are such a gentle soul, u are no where near boring to me. i wish u posted more on here  😞😞
Bro I want to give him a hug so bad. He’s so funny and such a entertaining person. He deserves the world, I have really bad anxiety and watching you guys makes it so much better.
“They got it for me and Chris” “I haven’t taken it off since” poor Chris got cheated out of a gift 😭😭😭
im so glad that Matt made this because I feel like im constantly waiting for him to talk and he gets interrupted so much but everything he says I relate to and I want to hear more so its nice to actually get a video where he can say whatever he wants and actually finish thoughts
We’re here for all your videos, Matt ❤️ Love to hear more of your thoughts! Can’t wait for the next video— whenever that is!
Matt you need to know how much we love you and appreciate you. I love you sm and forever ♥️
i love how when i noticed someone walking in the background he locked his doors because he is also observant 😭😭💕
i relate to matt so much. that's why i find him so comforting
I love the comment section sm
matt is so relatable-
I love the little notes you put after you say something— it’s so funny 😂
I love Matt ❤️  he's adorable! He makes me want to cry in a good way.
I have a twin and I hate being by myself tooo
this video felt like free therapy
The fact you have almost 300k subscribers and over 100k likes on this vid proves you aren't "boring" like you claim. Just because vids of you alone are less chaotic and don't have consistent talking, doesn't at all make them boring. You have your own personality just like Chris and Nick, and we follow the group channel, and now your personal one, because we love all of you as individuals. ❤
I getting bad anxiety too and I’m crying and stressing every single night now and it’s so hard. you and your brothers make my day better ❤️
I have really bad anxiety as well so like I understand 😕   I say that in like a depressing way but I am literally laughing every 5 seconds bc of what matt says 🙃😂
i love u boy
Please don’t forget You’re more than just a triplet. You 3 have such a special bond but maybe you can use this channel to try new things alone & thrive as Matt not just a triplet you know.. proud of you! It will get easier the more you do it!
He is enough 💙
this is so comforting
Didn't know that once a month is actually two months later:) (It's a joke)
i love you sm matt, you are not boring i watch the videos with ur brothers and automatically look for you <3 we all love you and appreciate you sm
Me watching this video every time I have anxiety>>>
Clothing haul matttt
I love this video it was good
I love that he wants to talk about anxiety and mental health somehow it makes me feel like someone finally understands what i’m going through as well.❤️ But i also loved the random commentary saying “i hope that makes sense” like yes it definitely did
i love how he doesnt hold back with talking abt his anxiety. i feel like influencers try to make us forget that they’re actual human beings with real emotions bc they never show them. and i like how matt doesnt do that. i can’t wait for his next video, whenever it is 🫶
This is off topic but I turned on text and when he said “me Nick and Chris” the text said “meenaak and Chris”
Storytimes would be good
we love you Matt 🫶🏼. honestly q&a and sit down talks are great.
you are not boring Matt. You are perfect just like you are❤️ Loveu
matt saying he's boring makes me feel sad because he doesnt realize how hilarious and nice he is, and when he gets excited abt the little things makes me smile so much.
I like this mat you should continue posting here
Papa me want more video😡
best 18 minutes and 22 seconds of my life
Am I the only one who doesn't really like clothing hauls?😭Like I'd watch for fashion advice, but not for entertainment. But I think Matt would really make it interesting!😌
I liked every idea that you said…(yes i forgot them too…)
Matt’s my comfort human and this is my comfort video
Aww matt you'll find your thing don't worry about everyone else and do what your passionate about ❤
You’re a great person with other people and by yourself only i’m sure you’ll find your own things when it’s time for them
bro the 18 mins literally passed by like 2 seconds. you’re not boring matt i love you sm
hi Matt, i love u<3
Ugh Matt your so gorgeous and fun❤❤😍
It makes sense
“once a month if you’re lucky” LMAOOO
He gives the same comfort as Emma chamberlain

You should do reaction videos
im so happy for this!  feels like a conversation here hehe, we love youuuuuu
MATT PLEASE DO MORE PLEASE
i enjoy matt's company so much i feel like we're hanging out i love it he's such a comfort person to me.

PLEASE POST ON HERE
Matt you are a blessing to this Earth, please never stop being you
this is so sad.....
I struggle with a lot of anxiety too so hearing Matt talk about his anxiety helps me feel better and feel more connected to him and it makes me feel like I’m not alone. I would love to see videos of him talk about his anxiety even if they didn’t come out often I would keep rewatching the same one(s) because I would find comfort in them. Other than anxiety I relate to Matt a lot and I hope to see more videos on this channel.
“Somehow, miraculously got here” 😭
I cannot explain how much I love Matt
i’m so glad it ended in a scream
The way he says claustrophobia is sweet.
I feel very comfortable when Matt talks about anxiety and small things that I do/many other ppl do too that’s not talked about much:)
You should do pranks on ur bros
more videos of you matt!!! we love you <3
Favorite and Most Relatable Triplet FRL :)
ive just come  back to watch this video, i’m really struggling to keep happy rn and iam so grateful for you , thankyou for always being with me and keeping me happy, forever grateful for you❤️‍🩹
I loved this so much! Thank you for wanting to represent anxiety and be fully honest about it as someone with a big following! We appreciate you so much 🤍
It breaks my heart when Matt calls himself boring. Matt isn’t boring at all he’s literally very entertaining and hilarious! Matt’s the best 💕 3:16
how am I sposed  to go on in life knowing that matt sturniolo thinks hes boring.... I hope he knows how many people truly wouldn't get through their day without him
i never ever comment but hearing you say your boring i can’t just not comment, it’s normal to feel “boring” by yourself because you’re always with your brothers and they speak for you when your lose your train of thought. but your find your way around it i’ll look forward to a video from you every few months😭and please do talk more about anxiety in another video it’s not talked about enough. you’re amazing take care of yourself.
this video is like my therapy every time I have a horrible day I just come directly to this video and watch the whole thing while sobbing into my sadness and just being sad and he helps me so much and I love him and wish one day I will be able to thank them for saving me
youre not boring at all, i could listen to you talking for hours!! and of course i love three of you but i enjoy your content the most, you are so comforting and i relate to you so please dont ever think you are boring :> also i would like to hear your journey with anxiety more if u feel comforable to talk about it a video would be good💖💖
One matt your not boring i love u and your so calming and very funny.  Pranks-yesssss Jewelry-yess  Clothing hall-sure
the way he doesn’t want us to worry :((( luv him
You don't need to be good at video games to post it, it will be good just to watch you playing in your own way and being yourself. You just need to do your things and videos and we will like it
you don’t realize how interesting you are, first of all talking about your anxiety and your different issues is so important, it’s helping people and make them feel more valid. also it’s important to explore your own ways, to learn things about yourself like you said. we want to hear your story, we wanna hear your opinions and everything ! you matter and we love you ! thank u sm for going out of your comfort zone and doing this. we appreciate you so much <3
He just makes me smile :)
Matt you're an amazing person, cute, funny, inteligent and have a great personality. We're here by genuine interest... keep going!
i love watching youtubers who talk abt anxiety bc it really makes me feel like i’m not alone so thank you!
I get that cause they have been with you since the day you were born and you guys have never really been apart
the way he leaves little funny comments for us. the way he reassures us he's fine and we needn't worry. the way he's being himself. the way he honestly talks about himself and his feelings. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PERSON IS PERFECT, ARGUE WITH THE WALL.
i love matt mans needs to post more
Matt I love you
The pink comments made me laugh every time LMAO
Matt, thank you so much for being so open and personal about your anxiety. I feel like alot of people with anxiety "forget", in a way, that others deal with some of the same things. Ik that for me personallyit helps me feel less alone. <3
Matt you are amazing and funny!! Please make more content like this and hear me out if you need to take a break please do because your Mental health matters!!
Honesty is key!! I feel like Matt being himself and telling everyone what we all experience but feeling like he’s the only one is so relatable, like I feel like that all the time and I know everyone feels like that but I don’t feel like it, Idk if that makes sense but yeah:)
Hey Matt, I don’t know how often you read your comments but I just wanted to say that you are my favorite triplet mainly because of how relatable you are to me when it comes to your demeanor and how you struggle with anxiety.   Many people think of anxiety merely as a complete mental breakdown in the fullest sense of the word. But it isn’t. It could be as simple as stressing about doing laundry and making your bed or extremely complex like overthinking and worrying about what you’ll do in the future and if you will become the person that you’ve always wanted to be.   I also wanted to say that you aren’t boring, because everyone has at least one thing they are passionate about. It’s just a matter of finding what that something is.   I love the car videos that you do with your brothers where you speak more about your opinions on certain topics because I feel as if you get talked over a little too much, so I can’t wait to hear your thoughts.   And by the way, there is no need to apologize for being a little all over the place. This is your first video by yourself, which can be intimidating. ( I know first hand because my sister and I do almost everything together also. )   I may not be able to speak for your entire fan base but just know that I will never judge you for being you.   ( sorry for writing such a long message… can you tell that writing is my favorite hobby and that I loved English class? 😂😊 )
i definitely get the feeling of feeling boring on my own. even though my channel is mostly me, when i make videos with other people, i'm so much funnier and i feel like they're more entertaining. then i feel bad when i make a video on my own because then i have no idea how to make the video entertaining.
mini van tour.
My eyes are watering so bad cause I feel the same way. You are not boring you are fun and you light up so many peoples life. You should definitely do video games I bet a lot of people would like to see that.
Every time I feel anxious or just am hating life I always come here this video helps me so much and make me feel ig not alone and I love it so thanks Matt ❤️
You are not boring Matt.❤️
наслаждаюсь этим видео
I love you
I love this so much. I’m so excited to see new videos from you :)
"damn I was blowing everything" LMFAO
i feel like so comfortable and safe here, i love it. keep it comin matt!!
Matt you are not  boring, you just talking makes me lowkey smille
I love you Matt you are literally the sweetest wholesome person 🤍
it makes me so sad to see him call himself boring all the time because he doesn’t know how special he is to us, he makes me and so many more so happy and entertains me all the time! there is so much pressure to be insanely busy and entertaining all the time but that’s not the need, you are great just the way you are! i love you matt
he’s so cute forgetting what he’s gonna say every five minutes
I REALLY wanna see outfit and jewelry hauls bc i LOVE your style so i hope you will!!!!
hi matt you probably wont see this but its my birthday and i wanted to say i love you guys so much also its ur fault i have a mattitude 😕😕😕
Aww Matt I don’t think your boring! Like actually. You are funny and very entertaining!! I would actually love to see you make videos and talk about things that aren’t always talked about. 💗 I hate hearing you say that you think you are boring because you aren’t!!
i 100% know what you mean with the memory stuff i forget so much stuff and then someone brings up something that reminds me of a good memory and it's the best thing ever
i know its been 2 months but im very excited for these anxiety talk videos because it’s nice to hear someone you look up to and love talk about struggles like that because it makes me feel like im not alone and i love to hear how you handle it yourself.
but you’re not boring matt. i know we all have our insecurities. but you are definitely not boring. we love you for you. keep it up bud :)
you seeing that person walking behind and locking the doors is such a mood.
WE LOVE YOU MATT!!! You are not boring whatsoever, you have impacted so many lives and i look forward to more videos from you❤️
Im still waiting for another upload here because i just find this video so comforting and i simply love it. BRING THIS BACK MATT!!!
i always get really bad anxiety so i’m so glad you’ll be posting some anxiety related content!!

Matt is me in my tiktok drafts
Well done, I really do understand you (about anxiety and sometimes think that I am boring) BUT when you started talking and seemed to be nervous, at the same time you were yourself, I laugh sm (specifically when you pause and write something). Thank you truly I loved this video, and watching I remembered one history about me which made me smile 🤍
my dog woke up and stared at the computer with that unique sound you made in the last second of the video
this feels like a facetime call and i love it ❤️❤️ even tho it’s been 2 months since this was posted i cant wait for the next
Matt dear you arent boring without your brothers you are just acalm person by nature and thats an adorable normal trait and the fact that you become energized around them is something to adore because you are Siblingss! And dont you ever say "attachment issues" its just that you comfortably depend on them on stuff just like how they surly do with you too cause again. SIBLINGS!. Srsly you are such a sweetheart dont think negatively ♡♡
Can u make a video were u tell over ur Anxiety??
I think Matt is such a genuine sweet person I would love to watch all of these videos and there not boring at all  ❤

It’s so sad when he calls himself boring and stuff when he’s really not. That rly breaks my heart. I smiled throughout the whole video! I loved watching this and sooo look forward to future videos of him just talking about whatever. Matt you ARE funny and entertaining to watch even without your brothers. We all love you Matt❤️
I REALLY LOVE THIS VIDEO 🫶🫶🫶🫶

the pink cards are killing me 💀

my comfort video
matt is the boy emma chamberlain
i really love watching this video once in a while. it calms me down. like being on ft with a good friend who understands my thoughts and feelings. do more matt<3 really enjoying these type of vids
So wild pickle juice is gross I have learned that it helps with like charlie horses my mom gets those like kind of cramps a lot so sometimes we have we used to have like the pickle jars we went my dad and me and my brother were like finished them off my mom doesn't like pickles so much but when we would finish we would leave pickle juice in the jar in the fridge so she would come out if it's like she was having a really really bad one she would have us bring them to her bring the pickle juice to her and she would have to drink it she doesn't like it but it does help her but here lately we haven't had any because I don't really eat pickles anymore and there is one time me and my friend were playing connect four and every time I lost she would make me drink something weird and one of them was pickle juice which wasn't bad for me like it wasn't like too gross there could have been worse options but yeah
I hate how he calls himself boring but he really isn't and neither are Nick and Chris I just think that he's a lot more quieter when he's around Chris and nick but I'm so glad he has this personal account where he can talk about his anxiety, and a lot more especially cause i have anxiety but I'm not the best at coping with it but you go Matt ❤
Sounds like a little separation anxiety from your brothers
matt, you have no idea how much we love you❤ you are a amazing person and don’t say your boring because your not! i love that your going to be opening up anxiety, that’s going to make people feel so much more comfortable about it! we love you so much you have no idea<3 ❤❤❤
First and last ig
How do u deal with ur anxiety?
Id love for you to talk about your anxiety because I struggle with it and it would just be great to see an influencer have the same experiences and acually talk about it
i love the idea of personal channels because we do get to know better the triplets separately and actually connect a little more.
next upload?? you’re my fav 🤫😭
i’m so excited for your individual stuff
WE LOVE U MATT 🤲🏽
matt is quite literally the opposite of boring, with or without nick and chris.  matt is truly a great person and cares for everyone.
the chances of you seeing this comment are slim to none, however, i recommend you start a series on your personal channel where you go out and do things alone. I had crippling social anxiety as a child and the only thing that helped me was to slowly expose myself to situations that i would feel uncomfortable or awkward in. (It could be as simple as asking for extra napkins at  a restaurant or volunteering somewhere on my own). Based on what you talked about I relate a lot.  You are a great speaker and very entertaining to watch. I feel that you have a great camera presence, you just need to get more comfortable embracing it.   Anyways, Ily Matt and keep being you! This video is fantastic so please continue.
The video wasn't boring at all
he should totally make his personal channel like a personal “diary” and get as comfortable as he can. speaking on his anxiety, his mental health, and his life kinda. i think a lot of people would honestly love to hear how he deals with it
he's so cute
I love to see you happy! and you are NOT boring at all! I'm really proud of you for opening up with us!
I literally love this, the anxiety talk is a great idea! As someone with anxiety it's really helpful to understand that the influencers we look up to can be going through the same things. And anxiety isn't talked about enough in my opinion, at least not in a serious, in depth type of way. I can't wait to see you upload videos on here, i love watching videos with ur brothers but i think it would be super cool to get to know ur personality and perspective a bit better. Also don't call yourself boring! Im so entertained just by listening to u talk lol. i'm just very much looking forward to seeing how this separate channel works out for u!
Re: people bringing something up that randomly reminds you of a good memory, that does make sense! I love that feeling. It's such a nice lil surprise when it feels like most lost memories tend to be negative and like suppressed for a reason, but then there's that rare gem of like, "Oh wow, you're right! I DID play the cello!"
You could react to videos! Btw u r not boring at all,we all love you
i love you so incredibly much Matt !! Don’t put pressure on yourself to post, we want this to be as much fun for you as it is for us <333 I LOVED THIS video so much, tyyy for being youu
could you make a video talking about your struggles with anxiety and or mental health?
13:24 “I used to just blow in that shi”
I promise ur not boring at all, I loved this video and I love you and ur brothers ❤
I love the way it's edited
I never learnt how to play the recorder I only played ukele piano acoustic guitar electric guitar and played the drums for like 2 seconds I still play the guitar ukele and piano now
MATTS EDITING>>>>>
⤵️ If u luv him<3
I don’t have any questions but btw ily🙃
do one of those 10 things i can’t live without videos
The fact that i just watched someone talking in the car for 18 minutes straight and loved it proves how much i love them
PRANKS
Waiting for the anxiety talk. Good job keep on going

ITS BEEN 2 MONTHS MATT COME BACK
Ly matt had a really shitty week this made me smile !
you could do a drive through video,matt
Loved watching the video, I rly hope you’ll find your place with your own channel! I think you really don’t need to worry about feeling like there’s not so much crazy stuff going on in your life, cuz that’s true for I guess 95% of people and that doesn’t mean they’re any less interesting.  Your honesty and openness is very much appreciated, you seem super self-reflected
MATTTTT i’m rewatching this since you posted it and you need to make a another video you’re actually so funny your editing is everything
matts my comfort person i cant i just love him soo much man he deserves the whole world im soo proud of you matt it makes me feel soo sad when he said hes boring when all hes been doing is entertaining me and many other people. I love you matt <333
Please never pee in a sink
Matt is so sweet and NOT boring at all I could listen to you for hours matt
he is literally as funny as he is with his brothers than he is individually! i love the adding text bit over the music, really makes me laugh lol
id love to see jewelry haul videos and videos of you talking about your anxiety matt!! we miss and love you!!
“Pickles never did anything to me if you don’t like them don’t eat them” -Mathew Bernard sturniolo
I love this video because I just put it down and listen to it while doing my makeup I’ve watched this video so many times because it’s so fun to learn about Matt without the arguing and yelling around him I love Matt so much his voice is so soothing and even tho there group videos are so funny it’s really nice to deep dive into just Matt
stop I love him sm
Hey Matt you may not see this but can you please make a video on how to deal with anxiety because I have bad anxiety and sometimes it’s rlly hard for me to cope with it so yeah I rlly hope you see this and you did amazing on this video I love you bye! ❤️
i love you and your brothers so much but you by yourself means a lot more to me for some reason. you’re my comfort person u mean so much to me <3
you are the sweetest soul i’ve ever seen. the way you and i are so similar is crazy to me. you help me feel so comfortable and comforted with my anxiety. and you help me feel not as alone. thank you for that, thank you for being so amazing. 🤍🤍🤍
so happy u started ur own channel!! hope u feel comfortable enough someday to post more vids consistently cuz this vid literally made my day so yeah u dont need to do headstands to make us laugh just be urself and thats it have a nice day and thanks for making me smile like a fool lmao🫶💀
The sweetest  soul 💛💛
I like how Matt sees the person walking behind his car and imediantly locks his door
You should do pranks on your brother's and friends that would be awesome! And opening up to us on here about your anxiety and anything else you wanna open up about
I love this and this channel will be amazing. Love seeing you on your own and being able to open up. I love you so much. You're a role model for sure
driving videos!! going to Macdonals together ect
I love this. I'm so happy that he can actually talk and say what he is thinking.
matt u are enough. when u say ur boring it really makes me sad. I hope u learn that u could talk even if u are with nick and Chris. When u are with them make them know that u have something to say. U are amazing and u could always talk to us.
mans gotta stop with the self doubt just go with it and speak, the people who really like you will watch all these videos and will appreciate you making these videos🫵
He's absolutely not boring, this vid brings comfort. His words hit
He is so fucking adorable
Yess as much as I love seeing all of you guys film together, Matt we all love you and you could never be boring to us!!
i drink pickle juice
I love how you have more subscribers then Matt or Chris. You are almost everyone's favorite triplet.
Idk why but hearing what instruments he’s played made me so happy 🥰🥰🥰
Do pranks!!!!!
matt in all seriousness ur awesome, not boring at all. love the videos, keep up the great work <3
i get what u mean about the attachment issues because i got 2 sibling too which im always withh and without them i get anxious
oh my gosh, i’m 2 months late but matt i’m here to tell you you’re not boring!!, your genuinely a funny amazing person. with or without nick and chris, these videos i honestly i love. thank you for opening up about the anxiety part. it makes me feel not so alone?? gosh i don’t known if that makes sense ahh omg okay!
Matt you're not boring and you are just as amazing on your own you don't need Nick and Chris to complete you you're awesome you're doing great
i smiled watching this entire video i love him so much
Ur so sweet❤️❤️
i love how he saw the guy walk behind the car in the rear view mirror and he immediately locked the car. that’s me
Matt is so relatable. He’s mentally attached to his siblings, he thinks he’s boring without actually doing something, and thinks rings can get uncomfortable after a while. i feel like this channel is definitely going to go somewhere.
Mat please don't call ur self boring because it ligit shattered Mt heart bro ilysm and ur not boring at all ilysm don't call ur self boring ur not at all ilysm
omg love u sm I NEED MORE CONTENT HERE
love u matt
I take meds for my anxiety
Hi, you're cute as heck.  Do gay boys hit on you thinking that you are Nick?
Matt thinking he’s boring hurts, he is so far from boring
OMG YES LOL ThE RECORDER, I only knew how to play freaking hot cross buns on that thing 😂
i know exactly what he means with the memory thing it gives me shivers but like the good kind lmaoo
you don't sound like an idiot, I SUCK at explaining things also and it's ya first video
everytime you said "u know what i mean?" i was always said like "yeah." outloud lmao. i get you matt and i know you can do this channel and do it well. you're absolute swag and your really not that boring tbh
matt i want you to know that u give us so much peace. i love you
Matt you’re are Not. Boring. You’re so genuine and truthful it’s kinda cool to see someone I look up to but so honest
13:23 and 13:42  I love Matt’s humor and editing style
i feel like he practices introspection a lot more but it’s just you’re aware of your maturity. Maturing is really up scary but its real
Matt I get what you are saying about separating with nick and Chris cause I can’t go two days without my sister even though she’s a pain in the ass I love you sm and you’re like the brother I never had❤️❤️
Damn this comments section just made me so happy, loving this community....Proud of u Matt, we're here for u <3
this video is so chill and relaxed, i love it.
Can you do a video where you talk about ur high school experience
Where tf did u put ur fingers in💀💀
Yeah this is neww
13:43 You were blowing what 😅
once a month he said... 2 months later
15:13 omg u sound like ur from another country
I relate to Matt sm
the intro is already giving !!! lmfao
Happy birthday 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎊🎊🎊
HAPOPPPYYY 19TH BIRTHDAY MATTT
i enjoyed this so much
Happy birthday
I absolutely love it when Matt screams at the end of each video. it's the cherry on top of every single one lmao 😂
I thought i was the only human on earth who forgets to eat their snacks and food while being surrounded by ppl that are listening to only me or to just be the center of the meeting uk ...GOD he makes me so confortable i love you Matthew thanks so much keep up u got this buddy
The thing is that you should normalize being the middle child even if u're triplets cuz trust me im a middle child and when i say u are 100% relatable im dead serious bout it
You ? Boring? Idiot? Dude you're literally golden and shining just like the STAR YOU ARE
I relate to you so much matt its really just comfortable listening to you talk, feels like we are on facetime with you! Id love some hauls or just debating random topics idk maybe also going live with us
Maybe you can use this channel as a personal journal! Talk about your day, your struggles, and anything else you want! Maybe try cooking a new recipe on camera, wake up before a sunrise and record your morning routine/ record your self doing self care. Anything really, bc your honestly so easy to relate to and I love watching you grow more confident to talk about your issues and aspirations in life :D Your awesome Matt and I hope we hear from this channel again :)
I loved seeing Matt being able to speak his mind and his thoughts without being interrupted or brought down for his thoughts i thought it was so cool and i hope he posts more on this channel because it was so comforting
Reason that I’m here watching your video it’s 100% that I don’t found you boring or things like that but when you talk I always want to know what are you gonna say. And that’s enough for me to subscribe your personal channel. Waiting for more of you
I usually don’t comment on yt vids but Matt fs makes me feel so seen as a person w rly bad anxiety. Like I can see sometimes in vids w all three of them when it “flares up” and when Nick & Chris are supportive it just makes me so happy bc there’s a lot of people w anxiety or mental stuff that can’t talk so openly ab it with family & on the internet so Matt providing this safe space is rly cool. It’s just nice to relate so specifically to a creator that’s becoming more and more popular
Matt this is the best decision cuz as u said nick and chris never stfu lmao and u never finish a sentence so finish them here lol
Matt I loved this video sm I felt like I really related to the things you were saying 💗
the only thing that matters (also to us) is that you are happy and comfortable with what you're doing or what you are planning to do and that you don't think you have to force yourself to something because you think we are entertained through it <3 we appreciate everything :D
I love ur videos<3 Ur personality makes me feel so comfortable and your way of speaking  He formulates the things that are going on in my head so well ykyk
I'm currently watching this video and not even finished but I couldn't wait till the end to comment.  Matt, you're not boring. I feel like you're just someone who's not super enthusiastic which isn't something bad at all. This video is proving it. I also find you talking very relaxing I hope that didn't sound weird. Because no hate to Nick and Chris but sometimes they make my ears hurt. Also you are very relatable to me and I'm sure to others too.
YOU ARE NOT BORING. Your whole personality is great. And you are not an idiot.   If you think you are, that's only your thoughts, and thoughts are just only thoughts. Sorry i just wanted to write it but now its sounds lame🧍
i love you to death
I love u so much
homie once a month its almost august LMAOAA
6:55 pls don’t pee in a sink
Him feeling so far apart from himself without his brothers makes so much sense, I’m so stunned at how easy it is for him to accept how they are a huge part of his life like that :) that’s awesome
matty b pls provide new vid i am in need.
The entire video was mat trying to convince us he isn’t depressed
you can tell he got way more comfortable as the video progressed
MATT I RELATE TO YOU SO MUCH
Please matt post more like this ilysm🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
but like, ur NOT boring 💗
عمررري هو متعقد من نيك وكريس 😭😭😭
U shouldn’t say that ur boring cause ur not and u should keep going on this I really mean it
Matt just making sure that we don’t think that he’s depressed bc everything he says sounds so sad
Please keep going i LOVVEEEE ITTTT
you're hilarious
i watched more than the half of the video and it just felt like 5 minutes. matt idk how u do it or what spell u use but keep going it’s fun
when matt said that he just does what nick and chris tells him to it just reminded me of how indecisive anxious people can be and how i actually act the same. you can do so much but you’re actually too anxious to do most of the things so you just wait for people to tell you what to do not to disturb them or disappoint them with what YOU want to do. it’s always been a matter of pleasing people when i do things for me. i fear doing things and annoying people so i just wait for them to ask me something to do, something that wont bother them or annoy them
when you have siblings who are also your physical support through your mental illnesses or struggles, it’s like your life’s made of theirs. you just care a lot about what they do and feel because they ground you and bring you back to reality everytime your thoughts get the best of you. you’re just so attached to them and you depend on them so when you’re alone, you feel fucking empty, as if you had no personality without them. it feels so weird to be this hollow but it’s a thing.
what’s true is matt’s not boring and any of us are, we’re just normal but social media influence and such it is thinking a normal life is boring and we all should go on fucking road trips and go to parties and on vacation to a chic place to have a life that matters. it’s just that we live in a fucked up system not that we’re boring at all. we’re just human.
this was honestly so comforting to rewatch. i love seeing you outside of your comfort zone(with nick and chris). it really puts into perspective how important certain people can be in our life. I honestly would love to see you post more by yourself 🫶
Can't wait for the next video :)))
honestly i really like this idea of them all having separate channels but i have a weird feeling im gonna be watching matt alot more than chris and nick but also the groups videos plus i think a lot of people are gonna think of this as a safe space to talk abt their anxiety or emotion they’re dealing with
this video is really comforting i adore matt and this really is a video i come back to to feel better
these ends always sends meLOLL
when u started talking about the instruments and the blowing LMAAOO
bro matt is so funny i was dying at those pop up words and the music
i love you so much Matt !!!! I promise you, you’re the utter opposite of boring. Thank u for being such a comforting person. 💞💞
i am matt in female form
I have such bad anxiety. such overpowering insecurity’s. I’m such an inverted and awkward person anywhere I go. I feel boring as well so it’s so nice to see someone who’s bringing light to those feelings. he’s such a comfort
guess who’s back watching this video cause my anxiety is panicking
my comfort płace
No because I agree with u about the superhero thing lol I would rather not let ppl down
Matt im really proud of you and im really thankful that youre going to talk about anxiety, because i struggle with it too and youre just calming me so much. Youre not boring and weird or shit youre saying. This  seems as if its such a big step for you to start this channel and we are all so proud of you. youre awesome ily so much! <3
Just found out about this  To be honest there is two main reasons I watch your videos (the other channel and this video) one because your guys are funny and lovey and amazing and creative and crazy 😂 and the second one is because of you because I relate to you so much how you think and the way you talk also I have the most talktive twin and I am the quiet and the right one 😂 and sometime he dont know if I am there 🙂 I am so so introvert to the point I can't even cross the road if you are standing on the corner or you are coming at my way  I would breathe heavily and I feel my body is on it own like I can't feel my legs and I can't look at anyone only to the ground and I am so weird and awkward and scary as personality so imagine on job meetting 🤡 dead 😂   so I relate to you by just being quiet and being the middle one or the second one and they way you talk is the same as me and that's it I don't know what I just write but i am looking forward to your videos when ever they come
it honestly feels so good to hear someone who’s done well talk about anxiety, idk it just feels like even if you have anxiety you can do things like this.
Loved that ending
God I feel so close to you
the claustrophobia thing i thought i was the only one who felt that lmao
You say you're not entertaining on your own but I personally found this video hilarious with the lil intersections lol
Yes! Very much needed anxiety talk. Excited for what's to come, you go Matt!!! xx
I would love for Matt to do Anixety talks because I would suffer Anixety myself and for him to talk about it would rlly help
when he said he usually isn’t able to finish his though and or sentence bc he gets interrupted and yelled at. that broke my heart 💔😫😫🥺😭
You are such an angel. Thank you for being so real, we all appreciate it more than you’ll ever know🤍
"pee in the sink" HAHAHAHA anything he says is so funny
literally my favorite person in this world.
i loved this video and would enjoy watching vids similar. i would also love to hear your view on anxiety and stuff bc i think people need more of that real relatable content
i really love this video, in a strange way i relate to Matt sm ,and this is so comforting , anyways i hope we get more videos like this :) love u matt <3
you should DEFINITELY do a day in the life with matt!
MATT!!!!! first off, literally love u sm, second, you should kiss the camera for your outro like u used to do on the group channel!!!!
came back to this video two months later because it still brings me so much happiness and comfort. i just know this channel is going to be my happy place 🫶🏻💕🤍
the way he kinda waits for Nick and Chris to finish his sentences
matt you’re not boring you’re actually the opposite! you may not be energetic like ur brothers but that’s so normal youre just you , u are laid back calm and chill af i actually enjoy watching you ! you should def post more 🤍 we love you!
but ur not boring at all
I really like this video. I have anxiety as well and can relate to a lot of the things he's saying. And i totally feel the same way about feeling claustrophobic when wearing rings. I can wear them when i'm out during the day, but as soon as i'm home i feel like i'm suffocating and i need to take them off immediately. I honestly think that this channel will be very succesful because so many people can relate and enjoy the more chill videos. You can also tell that he's being really sincere in the video and i think that that is something that is still missing from youtube ❤
So I think I have social anxiety but I’m scared to tell anyone and now that I know you have anxiety maybe you can help me with it? Btw: I love your vids❤️❤️
I JUST KNEW YOUS PLAYED DRUMS
YALL SHOULD START A PRANK WAR IT WOULD BE THE FUNNIEST THING!!
When he said “subscribe baby” I was like of course, immediately. 🙌
Thank you for talking about anxiety and making me feel so comfortable and understood!! You are amazing🫶💘
Coming back to this video for my anxiety attacks is the best self care ever
Matt I know you won’t see this, but you aren’t boring. You are the reason I’m still alive. I love you more then words can say. ❤️
the "DAMN I WAS BLOWING EVERYTHING" TOOK ME OUT HAHAHAH
You should do videos whenever you are driving alone... like talking and what not while youre driving and listening to music as like an insight to the driving anxiety world.... as someone who has bad anxiety too I feel like that would be beneficial to see and fun to watch :)
You're my favourite. I love you Matt, eith all my heart💞💞
I just set for 18 minutes and 21 seconds and just listened and it was amazing. ilysm Matt proud of you keep going.
I really don’t think Matt’s boring like it’s very interesting to sit and listen to him talk about different things. He gives a comforting vibe and it’s nice that he is talking this much because he doesn’t talk as much like Chris and nick (no hate still love them) and he is definitely not boring and I think his videos if he keeps going will succeed
lowkey im realizing that i have anxiety through this one video wtf this is weird
Also i like how he is making and talking abt mental health😁. Ppl go through things
Honestly i prefer matt over all. But to hear him calll himself boring is sad but i get it he loves his brothers their triplets their used to that.
matt is literally my comfort person, he deserve the world💘
i’m watching it again, and goddamn i’m so proud of him AND ofc nick and chris
0:10 his face glowed 1:56 he immediately locked his door when he saw that person 4:34 awww❤
I wish he knew how interesting and funny he is, no matter the content I would watch his channel and I think a lot of people agree with me because it’s so true
Matt I promise you, you’re definitely all of our comfort person❤️
I love him so much
I found this video and was so excited to watch the rest but there’s only one 🥲. Cannot wait to learn more about who you are as an individual🤍
he’s my comfort person.
i would really like you to talk about anxiety, cus fr I need a video like that :)
I love this types of videos of you just talking at the camera or answering questions. I think it could be really cool more videos like this. Keep going <3<3
u can make playlists in car maybe like just u driving and listen to your current favorite music
NO MATT YOURE NOT BORING YOU ARE SO AWESOME
matt you are not boring your just chill and laid back, idk about other people but i’d love more videos like this where you just talk and talk it feels like a genuine convo :) that outro was also amazing
matthew sturniolo you are not boring.
Love ya ❤️❤️
This video is honestly so funny to me, like this is literally wht goes in my mind whenever no1 is talking to me or my sis is not around. I just keep thinking random shit nd hv no idea wht is going on. Good luck boy, I find u fun!
matt ily sm
these are the types of vids I need depending on my energy!! majority of the times I’m laid back and chill and Matt is the definition of THAT. Makes me sad when he called himself boring, you and your brothers are the perfect mix of chaotic and laidback. anxiety is so overlooked especially since not many people talk about it especially like content creators… hearing him talking about how even driving by himself to another city gave him anxiety makes me feel better about my anxiety bc sometimes I feel like I freak out over the smallest things and get overwhelmed. *not saying he’s exaggerating* but yeah
we love u so much matt oml
i feel so sad when matt says that he plans on making more videos like this in the further, *unless* we don’t like them. matt you need to make videos that make you enjoy and are proud of because that’s what your fans love, seeing you at your most comfortable state. 🫶
I definitely want to see pranks
Definitely want to hear about your anxiety and clothing hauls I love your style
I play the trumpet its preety hard but once you get the fingerings down it get wayyyy easyer
even though u might think ur boring, i think ur quite the opposite. i love ur energy bc ur so calm and comforting it makes my day to listen to ur story <33
Matt it’s been 2 months 😭😭
Oh pls do a prank on Nick and Chris lmao
Although you said you are boring, loads of people clearly think otherwise. I personally believe you are relatable and make others feel more comfortable. At the end of the day you are you and this whole paragraph is cringe 😂.
idk what it is but matt just makes me smile like b4  started watching ur vlogs on the other acc my friend showed me a vid of you and ur brothers talking abut somth i cat remeber i just started smiling and yeah anyways ilysm (i would like more vids about ur anxiety and stuff if ur cool with that) x
aw matt ur not boring ur my fav<33
We love you lover boy
come baaaack!
i feel like this account will become a huge safe space for me Matt you’re not boring, you’re chill. i got absolute vibes from this video, i am totally looking forward to you making more videos like that<3 take care Xx
i love how he has little cuts with comments and its just so heart warming for some reason
kid it’s been 2 months… I need a new comfort video 🥺🫶🏼
i know you won’t see this but i wanna say that this video made me feel really comforted and safe and it makes me sad to think you don’t realize your worth:( your worth isn’t dependent on your brothers, you’re so much all by yourself. i love you :)
The fact that Matt called himself boring broke my heart. Please don’t think that way of yourself Matt. WE ALL LOVE YOU!❤️💗
I don’t even know what to say I just I really love this video❤️
Matt you’re such a vibe, you are our safe placa and we are with you!!!! We love how you talk and you for being just YOU!!!!!u r not boring at all. Thank you for this video, we love you!
no!! you are not boring :( not that it's really a bad thing to be boring like I get you matt but you're not <3 oh and I..struggle with anxiety too,, so definitely looking forward to your thoughts and takes <3
you should do some driving videos! speaking for myself, but watching people drive is just so satisfying for some reason 😂 and maybe you could talk about stuff that comes to mind then :))
You should react to fan edits from tiktok! And your not boring your really fun to listen to and I love you ❤️
i usually just come back to this video every once in a while it’s honestly my comfort video <3
i love how calm you are cause it calms so much!? i have anxiety too and it would be so nice to hear your own experiences and finally have someone to relate to :) like you said, creators don't really talk abt it.  keep making your videos, ily<3
i hate the fact matt thinks hes boring, hes really not he just has such a chill vibe around him. bro the pure relief i felt when he said he'd be doing anxiety talks and stuff is actually surprising but yeah im happy that he will cuz i dont know how to deal with my own anxiety lmao and its pretty bad
i know what he means by boring it doesn't always mean you don't like yourself just that you don't find yourself interesting compared to others.
Matt is the most relatable person I've seen on social media in a WHILE
I really appreciate that you mentioned anxiety and that you’re going to talk about it.
Ok ik im like 2 months late but wtv 😭 ur not boring and I’m not just saying that cuz im a fan of you but ur genuinely not boring
When you started talking about rings i’ve never related more
I know Matt is not going to see this but i’m so sorry about your anxiety i have it too and it’s not fun but i want you to know that we’re all here for you and i can’t wait to see some more videos from you ❤️
i love matt 😂 im over here snorting and laughing my a** off while he’s calling himself boring :( hes so relatable and funny
When Matt talks about how he, an already successful and rising influencer, talks about his struggles in front of camera, anxiety, etc and how he hopes to overcome them really inspires me and like other commenters you need to give yourself more credit Matt. You impact more people than you know; you are funny, witty, empathetic, and so much more which we all adore. Your gentle soul has and always will shine.
Stop saying that you are boring. You are sweet and funny, and i know that the other 107k people, think that too. We love you Matt.
I absolutely loved this video tbh, you should rewatch it and watch it with a positive mind, and see how great you are at this😌🔥
Rings actually help with my anxiety, maybe try getting anxiety rings
I have 5 siblings, so driving alone makes me anxious as well, omw I thought I was weird for that.
You are not boring Matt, at all!♡
PLEASE DO MAKE A VIDEO ABOUT ANXIETY, BECAUSE IT'S NOT TOUCHED UPON OFTEN!♡
You and Chris should do a prank on nick like leaving him out or something Yk bc he’s always in the backseat
Matt u are not boring 🫶 this whole video literally made my whole day! ❤️ ilysm and can’t wait for new content! 💯
matt i dont know how you did that i could never sit in silence
you bring a great comfort and chill vibe that’s entertaining!!
you’re definitely not boring i love the calm-chill vibe you have💜just be you, we enjoy watching!!
I don't think I've heard matt talk too much in a video I feel like nick and Chris always talk over him, but we love you matty b!!!!
I LOVE THIS  VIDEO
Please Matt, do more!!! I'm definitely excited to get to know you better
boy, i love you!!!
how do you cope with anxiety cause i have it and i have found it really difficult to cope and by the way you are not boring you are very funny and you are my favourite triplet. i love matt with all my heart and i really can not wait to see him grow and people could help with his anxiety if they show him love.
i actually love him so much pls do more vibe talks they’re so comforting and relatable
matt is my favorite.
I can relate 100% bc I'm also an identical triplet! I literally know exactly what you mean. Just show us whatever you feel comfortable with or passionate about. <3
i completely understand the attachment issues to siblings. i have attachment issues mostly with my teenage sister and i feel like none of my friends understand that when i ask if it’s okay to invite her with us, i don’t know does that make sense?😭
Your doing/did great for a first alone video
the fact that u called yourself boring but whenever i watched the other channel im always looking at how u have such a calm demeanor and ur so chill and laid back and that makes u 100% more attractive
Being a twin I relate so much to you lmfao especially about the anxiety
unlocking  memoriessss yessss
shouts out jimmy
no need to be so hard on yourself, go easy lol. you got thissss <3
we love you so much matt <3
14:10 I get what you mean. Like something is associated with a memory you didn’t know you had/ forgot about and someone brings it up and you get all these flashbacks lol
god i was having a full panic attack and i came to watch this video and now i am so much better
locking the door immediately after seeing someone walking in the background is totally me.🤣
ARE YOU ALIVE
WE R WAITING FOR A NEW VIDEO BRUH
MATT IT'S ALREADY A 1 MONTH
god he’s so precious, i wish he could see himself the way i do
I’m dying 😭😭😭
Maybe u can do videos showing us your fav artists/songs while driving and telling us your opinion about them
Thank God u have a YouTube Chanel on your own, you're so interesting and this gives me the opportunity to get to know you better.  Hi from Argentina ❣
That hit different when you said I have and attachment issues to Chris and nick
hi matt
Matt is so relatable
You should play a scary game! I recommend until dawn :)) Also, you should start streaming so if you are out of ideas, we could ask you questions during a live!!
matt is my favorite sturniolo because he taught me that having anxiety is okay, and i love how okay he is talking about his anxiety. he pains me when he says that he is boring, he is definitely not boring in my opinion, he’s very calm and chill but also funny at the same time. he has a very unique and cute personality, he doesn’t have to try to be funny and he always brings a smile to my face,seeing him happy makes me happy. matt is a very kind hearted person, a great brother and very talented.he’s smart and loving, and i feel like he would be very easy to talk to and i feel as though he would be a great listener. in conclusion i didn’t even mean to right a whole paragraph but anyways i love you matt! 🤍🤎
I'm late to seeing this but I loved this video so much. Just be yourself and talk about you want and your definitely not boring matt❤️
That hurts me that he says that he’s boring and u want him to know that he isn’t I think he just anxious about being alone
matt if you call urself boring one more time im rioting u absolutely are not
matt bullying himself while editing for 18 minutes straight
I feel like your videos are more personal and relatable. Like your comment about being boring made so much sense to me. Thank you so much for branching out and making this channel, I know that this channel will help me along with many others to feel understood❤️
I absolutely loved this keep making videos like this !!💙
What’s that thing moving behind him
yo matt u inspire me so much! keep up the great work man
you're so cute matt
ur my comfort person. during the triplet videos I’m more drawn to what ur saying more than the others (no hate love u all)
Matt says he’s boring but little does he know I came to his personal channel first and watched his video before going to any of his brothers personal channels lol
He's the finest triplet. 😏
14:18 who else besides me “got that” haha 💃🏽
OMG I TOTALLY RELATE TO THE RINGS THING. it’s like a sensory issue, and i always end up taking them off a ton. I only really like necklaces
MATT YOU’RE AWESOME 💖💖💖
ur my fav!!
I swear he only thinks that he is boring bc Nick and Chris weren't there to laugh at him. He's really funny and like people laugh at his jokes he just doesn't realize it bc they weren't there to prove it (if that makes any sense)
Half this video is him trying to convince us he’s fine…
0:06 aw
The way I love this video so much. Matt, I really needed and love this Chanel. Thanks for being so cool and real with us in this video :)
Dude Matt talking abt anxiety would be so awesome, and he’s not boring hes just calmer than Chris and nick. What he said abt being bland without his brothers I totally relate to, like I’m a twin and whenever I’m without my sister around our friends I just feel so uninteresting and awkward but when she comes back it’s so much better. Matt’s my favorite triplet❤️
we love you matt. don’t ever think you are boring. i love you INDIVIDUALLY in every single video you’re in.
“pickles never did anything to me” 😭
I’m literally so ready for Matt’s videos I think it’s going to be so fun.
Ur struggle is so real as an introvert i can relate to u in a spiritual level
I kin matt
He’s just like me fr
I love clothing hauls, and its like totally oke to talk ab anxiety here bcs its a learning moment for most of us including me, and maby some stuff ab yourself! Im looking forward to the videos that are coming 😁
Matt babe i think it’s time for a new video 💗
It's giving Emma chamberlain and I'm here for it .
i seriously don't understand how you can call yourself boring, this video was honestly great, it made me laugh and i actually enjoyed it, btw you have 200K subscribers while nick and chris have like 100K so you're just as entertaining as they are. i hope you post more videos soon matty!!
You r amazing, not boring at all. I enjoy watching you, love you Matt ❤️‍🩹
the blowing part really got me laughing lmaooo
matt, we love you soo much and i hate to see that you keep putting yourself down by saying that you're boring alone bc that's literally not true. i really liked your personal channel bc i relate to you on so many levels, even with the anxiety part, so i 100% understand what you feel like. it was also really great to hear what you have to say without getting interrupted, you are very entertaining don't worry! i hope to get more videos from your channel, ily
I feel like nick edited this video for him😭🤣
"once a month" it's been a month jajaja jk ily
i love matt i relate to him sm
I think that talking about even the little things with your anxiety is a GREAT way to help cope with your feelings. I love that you are willing to share your anxiety with us. As a person with clinical anxiety/G.A.D I feel very safe and not alone with my anxiety. Thank you, just thank you.
Matt I beg u we need more of these videos! Also as an "video idea" I would just like to know ur train of thought like whatever u are thinking about just let us know even if it is the most random thing 👍 or maybe take us somewhere if u're comfortable like to the Walmart/ some grocerie store and do challenges
♥️
atlas corrigan is that you?
i wanna se video games:)))))
I relate to you so so much
15:00 same like it's just nasty to me. No hate to people who do it, just like, don't around me because that's the type of shit that would make me puke on site.
Matt you are so real. I feel so confortable its weird. I swear youd be my best friend.
I actually enjoyed this video a lot. I almost felt like I was chilling with you in the car. You are one of the most laid back You tuber's I know of and I relate to you so much and am drawn to your energy. I understood everything you said about your anxiety in this video, like about the moments of panic that might not seem like a big deal to others. I really love the way you present yourself to the world and I love your sense of style, your accessories suit you so well (like the butterfly earrings and the simple necklace from Nick and your mother). I really hope to see more of just you, peace <3
matt deserves the world. his soul is so kind and pure and just alone he is funny asf. and him getting comfortable enough to talk abt his anxiety makes me feel comfortable and so much better bc i also struggle with anxiety. he is literally my comfort person. <33
matt deserves the world. his soul is so kind and pure and just alone he is funny asf. and him gonna talking abt his anxiety makes me so comfortable bc i also have anxiety. he is literally my comfort person. <33
Matt your really not boring. Its just that you think that because its a new step for you. You got this! 🥰
matt you are not boring at all. just hearing you talk just makes me feel better. im having problems with my mental health and stuff do i was literally just crying. so i was like im gonna rewatch matts video and i stopped bc you just make me so happy. i need you, even in on the triplets channel, it would t be complete without you. i know this is hard for you but i promise we all love this video Matt. i love you so much.
😍
awwww when he was talking about why he wanted to be a sidekick omg I wanna give him a hug so bad ❤️❤️❤️
Omg your not boring Matt you are an amazing human being and omg you are such an inspiration especially talking about anxiety I agree a lot of YouTubers/ celebrities don’t talk about that and it does need to be talked about just you as an influencer talking about it is just an amazing thing
BRO YOU JUST PUT INTO WORDS HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE WHOLE SUNRISE/SUNSET THING. like my take is, when I wake up early on accident and actually get to see the sunlight coming from the east instead of the west, I feel like I just accomplished something huge lmao. sunrises make me feel way more productive and special and calm like “hey I actually have time to do things today”. And even if I spend all morning on my phone until let’s say 12pm, it’s still 1000 times better than waking up at 12pm even though technically wasted the same amount of time in both situations. that was a paragraph for no reason 💀
This youtube channel feels like it’s going to be such a safe space
I absolutely love hearing Matt’s perspective, please continue doing this king <3
MATTHEW ALEXANDER NEWTON STURNIOLO-  update please:)
video idea:real talk, you talking about controversial and personal things (just an idea?!?)
honestly, you could do videos where you literally just talk about whatever is on your mind and i would 100% listen. fr.
anxiety is kinda my thing. ive been having anxiety since i was 1st grade so when i was 7 years old? but yea and tf chris and nick have no license bruh ur like 18? 19? well its okay bc my older sister is in college and has no license and doesnt know how to drive so love yall. i love you and your brothers infinity and beyond. everytime i see u guys i get butterflies in my stomach. thats unbelievable but you guys are my like favorite youtuber on god! also me and chris have a lot in common hahaha dont tell chris bahaha. and when you and your brothers “fight” its fun and cute. and you and chris act gay to each other bahaha. say less matt say less. sturniolo brothers 4LIFERS!!! <3
The recorder story was so funny and cute
Your doing great matt. I pinky promise I will watch ever video your great and this was a good video 💕
haul pls
Matt you're so precious. I'm so glad about you speaking of anxiety and stuff like that because this makes me feel good with who I am and what's my mental health. Love u.
You probably won't see this but Matt you're not boring. This video had me laughing at the perfect times. The little messages in the middle of the video were great. I do think anxiety videos would would be great because it's comforting knowing that ppl understand how you feel. I understand you feeling different when you're not around Nick and Chris. I feel different when I'm not around my twin, so I  get that. (That explanation part was great) I know I don't physically know you but I'm here for you. So far contents great 💗.
I don’t think he realizes how much we love and appreciate him :(
honestly this video was comforting. and i would love more like this
Video idea: storytime about you being stung by a bee!!
I adore you Matt I’m so happy to finally listen to you without being interrupted ❤️
i love this
need more matt alone content forsure. <3
i think being a semi-gaming channel would be really cool! i’d love to see what games you like to play and hearing your commentary about them!! loved this video too <3
im sorry did you just say boring? I respectfully disagree
i literally loved this video. you are the funniest, sweetest person ever. 18 minutes and i never got bored listening to you. this was too funny and good. so proud of you and of this video. id love to see literally anything. this car video was amazing
matt, u are cool <3
I PLAYED THE CELLO AND DRUMS TOO LMAO
anxiety and clothing hauls definitely!!
I really love this video. Matt makes me so happy. Also, you are not boring, you're just learning what your thing is and that's okay. I also feel like I'm a boring person. Anyways have a good day. sorry I'm awkward
I don’t know if I’m a genius or if you’re really well spoken but I’m a French guy, I speak French, and now I also speak English and when I listen to you explaining your thoughts and feelings I totally get you and you portray your thoughts and emotions like crystal clear so yeah it makes a lot of sense to me when you talk, thank you for putting into words what others can’t do. You have this ability in you and I wish you could see it the way I do, you have such a good heart I love youuuu bro.
This is why I need a sibling I am the only child and I literally don’t want to come home when there is no one home because my parents are at work and I have no siblings.. I used to be so relieved that I don’t have any siblings but now I want a sibling so badly 😂
Just saying i would absolutely love if you made a vid on anxiety cuz its something i really struggle with also i love you sm matt 😭😭❤️❤️
Separation anxiety. I have it too with my twin
CHICKEN WINGSSSSSSSSS
the sunrise sunset thing was factsss
clothing haul- yessss anxiety- yes, it’s really important to talk about music- yeah, drop a collaborative spotify playlist link (if u use spotify)  gaming- Wordddd!! Go live on twitch bro day in the life- maybe reinvent yourself to be matthew sturniolo without nick and chris sturniolo   get to know urself without ur brothers, my love
Oh mat how i love u
oh matt, i love you so much <3
Hearing matt talk about his own experiences made me feel not so alone and finally, someone understood it..yknow? So excited for this channel matt! We all love you soo much and are so pumped for the future <3
This is why he’s my favorite I’m not talking favorites out of like looks or things like that just his personality and more of his anxiety and speaking on that and feeling like he is boring stuff like that I feel the same way so having someone finally speak up about it is nice but also knowing that he’s trying to step out of his comfort zone with his arm wrestle channel is also a big step but that’s why I love him❤️❤️❤️
I get where he is coming from so fucking much. Although i’m a twin and not a triplet, i just relate to the fact that he leaches off of his siblings because when you have someone the same age as you that you spend every waking moment with it’s hard not too. I have bad anxiety too and especially when I don’t know what my next step is or how things will be, especially in school. Like i’ll panic about having to find a seat in class next to a friend or at lunch. But, since i have my twin sister she’s like my safety net and I can always go and sit next to her (although it drives her crazy when i’m always trying to find her and shit). She is always like “quit following me”, and i know this sounds stupid, but it’s like i can’t function without her almost, like i just sort of feel helpless and like i can’t be myself without her sometimes. Also, it can be hard to reach out to other people and make new friends because one it gives me wicked bad anxiety trying to talk to new people, but also because she is always there to lean on and that’s what i tend to do. It kinda sucks but i’m glad i’m sort of coming from where he says and that I can relate to someone through this. It sort of feels lonely at times and i really can’t explain it but 😭😅 Love you Matt, thank you for sharing this and if you get where i’m coming from (or if anyone in this similar situation does) i’d love to what takes on it! 💕
I just love him 💕💕💕💕
Since you asked, here is what I’d prefer to see from your channel (in order) 1. I don’t really care for clothing halls -but if you can manage to make it swift & straight to the point I’d be down (I dislike it when ppl do a haul explaining what the item is as if we’re not seeing it on camera) 2. OMG ID LOVEEE to see your growth with anxiety and your coping skills, you and I are both 18 this year so imagining us growing together sounds so cool 3. Harmless pranks sound fun, not so much life in a day tho (if ykyk)
The feeling when ppl bring up good things like memories is nostalgia and I love it especially when it is something you forgot about like childhood songs or shows omg
Hey sweety U are more than enough and incredibly entertaining just on ur own. You as an individual are loved and make so many so happy including me so do not underestimate urself. I think it would be good for you to learn more about yourself and explore yourself as one person. You talking about ur anxiety makes me feel so relieved and u are so brave and I have been thinking of doing social media but have some anxiety around it. Love you sweety x
You're absolutely not boring at all. And I actually like what you're going for with the contents you're about to upload.. because honestly I relate to you about a lot of things. And I believe that it's not only gonna help you but it's also gonna help the most of us.. because w/ this we'll realize that we aren't the only ones who goes through anxiety. So thank you so much in advance Matt!! :")) Keep going.
I feel like Matt's personal channel is going to be really interesting. Cause we don't hear Matt as much in videos with all three of them. Love you Matt ❤️
Anxiety talk
Matt is the most underrated triplet eva
I live for the chill videos Matt!!!
this video alone was very entertaining matt and what you said i understand that feeling of unlocking a memory you didn’t remember you had and then having a good feeling come along with that memory it’s immaculate!!!!
i’ve been having a really rough day and this really calmed me down. i just love the way you… talk, ig?? idrk that sounds creepy, but just the way you speak is nice
You should do videos where you drive and talk and go through drive thus and stuff
Matt, you are no where near boring my dude, although it may be hard and awkward to do these without your brothers, you've impacted so many people
I LOVE THE PINK SCREEN COMMENTARY WITH SUCH A PASSION
WOW!! U spoke faxxx! And please do more honestly I think ur talks help me through my day🙂💗 and like u said “DM’s are open” eel is Chrises open?
Do you think you could actually do a video talking about anxiety? I'm thirteen and I don't really know how to calm down and relax when I start getting anxious
i finally got to watch this and matt this video literally make me so happy
Haven't posted yet?
You should try doing storytimes.
matt, I really hope you’ll realise you’re so precious and completely not boring. I love you so much, we all do
When I see you, I feel happy that you are so very handsome, the way you talk, your laughter and your calm voice, I love you so much.
i think you should def make an anxiety vid whenever your ready
I feel like matt calling himself boring is extremely wrong. I'm not a twin or anything myself but I can sort of imagine how hard it must be to be your own person when you're a triplet. All of them are totally different yes. But in their daily lives they're constantly together, do all the same things and are seen as practically one. I imagine it would be extremely hard to separate yourself from that, which must be a genuine struggle sometimes. I also think people's preferences really vary too in what kind of content or personality they enjoy watching. Like I for example when watching the triplets like seeing matt because I see myself in him sometimes. He's extremely funny without even fucking having a clue about it, he seems very genuine and nice too. He's also the most chill one out of them which I appreciate, I am too yk you don't need to be crazy energetic all the time. That's overwhelming sometimes so I think Matt really balances out the energy from chris and nick with the same kind of funny and entertaining energy just more chill. He seems sometimes overlooked or misunderstood which pains me cuz he genuinely is funny and entertaining. Also love the anxiety talk, not many influencers are brave enough to share that. Just hope matt knows he's appreciated.
Aww he looks lost but this was actually a really great video
Matt is the most relatable triplet to my personality and it makes me happy, I think I am boring too and I have anxiety. So its good to see you having fun and the channel getting bigger anyway
you’re not boring ong <3 + i love the comment section like everyone writing paragraphs is so wholesome :,)
I ACCIDENTALLY DISLIKED I DIDNT MEAN TOO
matt is my comfort person. 🫶🏼
I wish matt knew that hes not boring. and hearing that he has some of the same struggles as me feels comforting in a way. I love you matt💓
Matt talking anxiety makes me feel like I'm not alone. Most creators put on this perfect face and when creators do open up it's never/rarely about anxiety. Matt talking about anxiety is amazing and I feel like his channel is going to be amazing.
bruh matt you ain’t boring your actually my favorite like i like chris and nick but your my fav
this is why i relate to matt so much. i get terrible anxiety sometimes and i’m a quiet person. We also have similar personalities
matt please keep making these personal videos! its really heartwarming to see that one of my favorite creators share the same struggles as me! hope to see more content :) love you matt <3
Matt calling himself “boring” hurts my heart not only because he has a very good vibe alone but sometimes the people around him may make him believe he is “boring” because he doesn’t talk as much as his brothers when in reality he is a fun person to hear talk and hearing him express himself really shows the real person he is. I believe this channel will definitely help him express more of himself than just being known as a triplet but instead showing who he is and us reacting positively he will see that he is relatable and isn’t alone because we relate with things he shares and deals with. Personally, the same thing happens to me.. my friends often call me “boring” when in reality I don’t talk as much as them but when I do, I realize that I really impact other people in a positive way I really relate to Matt in so many ways from that to having anxiety it really impacts the way you are and I am so happy to see him go out of his way to make separate content you go Matt we are all here for this:)
VIDEO GAMES
he’s so cool
Oh God i love this guy❤️
honestly i relate so much w matt <3 ur not boring. you could do months favourites, like music, books, clothing pieces you liked this month and stuff like that it would be really interesting just an idea
iloveu
i personally love this video, don't find it boring at all
Matt calling himself boring really hurt me. He is literally so much more then that. Like in this video he was really funny in this vid with the little things he does. Even if he does see himself as boring just seeing him is more than enough. He is so funny and amazing.
My heart aches because I can empathize with how you feel. When I am without certain people in my life, that I spend every second with (for example, my sister) I feel completely useless, like I can't function. I've recently been doubting my personality, because it feels like half of it is based on my sister. I am trying to work on my self confidence, and this video really helps me feel as though there are other people who feel this way.
I could watch this video over and over again
Is nick still editing your videos 🤣the way he sead"yes, you are dumb" 😂
Matt is literally amazing i love him so much this video was so amazing and comforting hes so awesome ❤
THIS IS GOING TO BE A GREAT CHANNEL!
You should do more of these also Ilysm
love to see matt growing as an individual, i’m so proud of him 🫶🏻
yeah yeah but.. how big r u?(down there)
Do horror video gamesss
I don’t think you understand how genuine you are, you’re chill, hilarious and no where close to boring. You make so many peoples days including mine and I hope you understand that you’re awesome by yourself without nick and chris and how much we love you <3
I feel the same i can't live without my twin she's my other half she completes me
Love u, Matt❤️
I’ve had anxiety for a couple years now and what is sad it makes you think you are boring .I feel like I’m my friend group I’m super boring but it’s just the fact that my anxiety makes me limit everything I say or do bc makes me think people would think whatever I said was either boring or too much.So I just keep quite and let everyone around me be the loud ones .
7:14
YES ANXIETY TALKS I NEED THEM
I feel you, Matt, one-hundred percent. My anxiety levels skyrocket, especially when I'm out in public or driving alone without my family or friends. I think it's because in general, you mentally feel safer when you have someone you love alongside you, especially in a new place. And I love the idea of you starting your own channel, don't ever feel like you can't speak about something that's bothering you or on your mind, we love listening to you, no matter what it is, and you know we won't ever judge 💙
you could do driving videos? i know you said you felt weird when you were alone but it could be good!
It was so nice to finally hear what Matt has to say but I find it really funny how even tho he’s alone he can’t finish his own thoughts
you could talk about your favorite / least favorite series ! or even react to some movies if you like that
I love all three of the boys but its so nice getting to just hear matt talk without getting interrupted. He’s usually not as loud as chris and nick so i feel like its easy for him to get talked over in the vids. And we don’t think you’re boring matt!! it’s actually so calming to just listen to him talk about absolutely nothing lol <3
i love you
You’re doing great Matt! Love you
I like the very very ending of the video. That should 100% be your new Outro.
matt stfu i love you
U AINT BORING
i’ve rewatched this video so many times, my comfort video fr
Him calling himself boring made me so sad 😭 your not boring you have a great personality your just way more laid back and get talked over and it’s so nice to see you impacting people on your own. It’s just so wholesome
3:16 I think what Matt was trying to say is that he thinks he is boring without Chris and Nick because they are each like a third of his own personality. He just isn't really whole without them because they make Matt who he is. Although I disagree that he's boring! And talking about anxiety would be good because I fell like that would help a lot of people who have anxiety to feel understood. Love you Matt 💖💖
Yess please talk about mental health and anxiety 🙏🏻
This video is so comforting tho. 10/10 vibes right here, u just have chill energy
antes de este video eras mi favorito y ahora lo confirmo
as a girl, i envy this man's clear as day skin
I literally started crying, I don't think he understands how much I feel comforted by watching him and like he's prob not gonna see this but I really just want to hug him like for him and me
6:50 I’ve never related more omg not having a bathroom near makes me so anxious too
the edited little comments add so much to the video
you're not boring. your brothers (i love them to death but it's true) constantly say "you're boring you're boring" when ur literally not. they just cut you off often when you're tryna say smth (at least what i've seen from car videos).
this video have the same energy that all emma chamberlain's videos, sooo conforting and real love u matt
love you so much
Looking forward to seeing anxiety vids)
I feel like seeing you play Fortnite with your friends would be funny
🥺his alone his cute those three triplet make heart sooo happy and sad cuz how cute there are they make my day ✝️💜
MATT IS SO FUNNY BRUH
Matt, a lot of people can relate to you.  In this video, when you started talking about things you are interested in, it was very entertaining. Video ideas: Go to different fast food places and try a different item. You like to snack on stuff so I thought it would be fitting :)
as someone who thinks that they have anxiety but not feeling comfortable to talk about it to anyone but myself I loved watching this video because I relate to the things that happen to Matt and maybe seeing Matt have anxiety and still talk around a lot people would make me feel like its fine and that Thinking that everyone around me wants me to shut up because I’m boring or loud or stupid is just me overthinking. because this just happened when Matt said that he is boring, because he is not and that’s just his anxiety making him overthink and see himself as a boring person. I hope Matt sees that he’s not a boring person and that if he was there wouldn’t be like millions of people watching his channel. And watching Matt talk without being interrupted you can see that he is a very entertaining person. And btw Matt was the only person that made me feel comfortable about having anxiety because I think I have anxiety but before watching Matt talk about anxiety I hated that I thought that I had anxiety. And every time I realize that I might have anxiety I start dining it and saying that I’m overreacting. But every time I see Matt talk about his anxiety I feel like it’s a normal thing and that it’s ok if I have anxiety.🤍 this channel is definitely going to be my safe place because I feel comfortable being here😅💙 I know that was a very long message sorry I like to talk to much 🥲
I Love This 🥰🥰
I DIED AT THE BLOWING JOKES AND HE SAYS HE’S NOT FUNNY OML
you are not boring !!! 💕💕
pranks umm answering questions doing challenges stuff like that ...
i don’t think i’ve ever heard matt talk uninterrupted for this long. love it tho
HI
watching this for the hundreth time. thank u for posting this masterpiece matt :)
this is Definitely gonna be a safe space for a lot of people matt is such a kind soul and that’s what makes me love him the most
Bro I wish you could see you're self like we do
Matt: *calls himself boring*  Me: *smiling and laughing the whole video bc hes quite literally the opposite*
U should do a music playlist in the car
MATT you don't need to talk your videos, you aren't boring your not weird you inspire me so so much you guys have helped me a lot over the last few years just remember you are amazing I love you
excited 4 more 🐞
Matt, when you are open I feel safe about having mental health issues. It's brave to be so open with it. I'm really struggling right now and knowing it happens to many people helps. Especially when i hear influencers talk about it, because it makes me feel like I'm not the only person out there who is going through stuff. Please remember, everyone in the comments who have said they also struggle and Matt, that this part of our life is temporary. Happiness isn't forever, but neither is sadness. I hope everyone has a wonderful day ❤️
the little comments throughout the video are fucking sending me LMAO
I personally love the idea of this videos because now I feel like Matt is SO relatable and I love that. :) good idea!
Matt you are not not boring your more chill back then Chris and nick Chris is very chaotic and you are not boring this video was very interesting
btw that was a great outro keep it up🫶🏻
i loved just listening to what you say <3 dont you ever think we dont enjoy you being you!
Matt, I just watched your first alone video again, and I wanted to add that I really liked it because you presented yourself so openly and honestly.  I love knowing the real you, and that’ what that video allowed.  You weren’t afraid to show your true self or vulnerabilities, and for me that honesty is your true beauty.  So, keep up the good work.  You have more to share than you think.
this is my safe place already 🤍
Sidekick because, “your not letting half as many people down” YEA FELT FELT THATTT
WHEN YOU SAID THE THING ABOUT THE THING ABOUT THE WORDS CONNECTING TO GOOD MEMORIES AND STUFF I WAS JUST LIKE… DANG that is a good feeling.
You are definitely my favorite, I really identify with what you say and I really appreciate this channel. Like… idk. Your just chill and I really appreciate it because Idk I’m kinda chill. I genuinely do want you to talk abt anxiety and struggles you’ve had. Idk, I feel like you shouldn’t beat yourself down as much tho, because you are absolutely amazing.
bro... chill on that bright ass pink screen. bitch finna make my ass go blind
the way he just kept looking at nick and chris’ sits
Your not boring and this will definitely become one of my comfort channels :D <3
You can always do a prank video
Jewelry tour and clothing haul fs!
I love Matt so much. Truly Matt is an awesome person.
the explanation about having sibling and then not it's such a good explanation to people with siblings lmao, I get u Matt
YES make videos about anxiety, they will be VERY helpful!! 🙌
This made me feel valid 😭 were so much alike I'm not a triplet or anything but I have attachment issues aswell and what i think you mean was you feel like you can be wird and funny because you bounce off eachother but when your alone its like how do i do this or like their still there and safe right or if you just didnt make them up
I'm so excited about your new channel Matt. you're not boring at all, don't underestimate yourself like that. you're so funny. ilysm ❤️
"subscribe baby" yaaaaaaaaas baby done that alreadyyy
I don't think it's boring at all, it's just relaxing and I love it!!!!.
I'd love to see anxiety talks from you because I have it too and it would be very interesting to see your experiences ig <3
You just made me smile with the video <3
I got what he said about having attachment issues with his brothers, cause my sister and I do everything together and 3 weeks ago she left 5 hours away for 5 months and it's really the thrive without her alone
Let’s say you, Nick and Chris go shopping. And you film it, edit it, then post it on your channel. It’s a vlog and I know what you said about it. But you can still hang out with your siblings and post it on here. Also you are definitely not boring, we all love you for who you are. :) <3
Matt, this is why your my favorite<3
the way he locked the door when there was someone walking behind the car😭💀
love this!!
Hi Matt
i got here just through u but i am gonna also check out ur other channel w ur brothers
You should do pranks on your brothers lol
Your not boring my guy…your an intp
matt, youre in no way boring, on the contrary youre very funny and i love you. without you i would not be watching at your youtube with chris and nick. im really sorry that you think of yourself as boring.. but youre really funny, you look very positive and nice as well. i love you so freaking much matt<3
Love you Matt <3
Matt you're literally my comfort person and my favourite sturniolo!
I am waiting for another video Matthew
So exited for anxiety talks!!!
Tbh Matt you are not boring you are just calmer and sometimes we need a calmer and comfort channel to go to when we need it. You warm ALOT of peoples hearts just be youu and please express yourself were all here for you and to listen to you. This channel will be fun and VERY good for me because i love listening to you talk and not only that to see you have something for yourself same with Nick and Chris. I love youu and you guys !!! Takd your time with Channel and yourself and were all going to adventure off with youu. Thanks for this personal channel .
i think it'd be interesting to see some videos trying out new hobbies! like painting/ drawing and things like that, loved this video, loverboy
*sees someone walking in the back* Matt: *locks car doors quickly* 😂 nice
I definitely get how he has attachment issues to Chris and Nick. I have separation anxiety with my mom and sister. the fact that my sister is going to college in a few months, and then I go to college a year or 2 later, scares me and give me a whole lot of anxiety
It's so precious that you could do this and figured out the things that you like for yourself. Like, sometimes it's so healing to take a moment for ourselves. I really support u with this, i think it's amazing❤. (Btw you're not boring wtf)
Matt is so friggin relatable I love this video and I'm excited to see more from him ❤
13:25 LMFAOOOOOOO
did nicolas edit this?
matt ur not boring :( i’m really looking forward to the anxiety vids because i struggle w heavy anxiety myself 🫶🏼
ayyoo!!! i played the recorder and i play cello now!!!
Matt: ima talk about anxiety  Me: Subscribes immediately😌
4:34
You should just take us for a ride with you and show us your music taste and go to McDonald’s order 😂
THE OUTROW STOPPPP???😭😭😭😭
we love the videos continue please😩
yessss ikr when we remember something we almost forgot :)
excited for this channel!!!!!💕💕💓💗💖💘
yes, the anxiety talks is something we massively need!!
nice
A solo mukbang would be cool
Matt saying he is boring but me thinking he is the most interesting because he is laid back compared to crazy
you aren’t, never was, and never will be boring. promise, love you the most 🧘‍♀️
BRO I LOVE THAT YOU FEEL LOST WITH OUT YOUR BROTHERS 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Love bug, I think we'd all love to hear you shed some light on struggles with anxiety. And I think q&a's specific to those kinds of topics and other ones would be good. Like if you just lend an ear to our situational issues. And give advice where you can, that'd be cool. And then just topics where we send in anecdotes or stories and you read em and comment on them. Like you'd do with your brothers but just you talking 👌 and also, seperate thing, I think a day in the life from the perspective of you would be cool even if it features Nick and Chris. Like daily routine, food you eat, stuff you do for content purposes, gaming, night time routine to get yourself like relaxed, etc. And of course for a lot of that there would be Nick and Chris in the background, but still, it's YOUR perspective. And that's what this channel is meant to explore.
me knowing matt from tiktok edits, literally haven't watched any of the triplets videos and im going to say, that i really like him. he makes me feel safe
you need to POST MORE your AWESOME
so happy for you that you actually put yourself first, chose to film and post like really thank you!! great video on heavy topics i love you sm. Idea for a new video ; get up really early and go watch the sunrise!! i promise that's the best way to start a day and could be a great opportunity for you to see the sweatness of the sunrise!
Matt you are an amazing person and it is actually so interesting to hear you talk and express yourself.
you’re not boring i could listen to you talk all day😭😭
If your reading this right now thanks for listening .So when You said attachment issues that is called separation anxiety. I’m sorry that you have that I have dealt  with that n it sucks. It also makes me sad that you call your self boring  Bc  your not you are actually really funny.  I love you with all of my heart n if your sad it makes me sad. I’m excited for you to start your YouTube Channel I can’t wait for more!!
Matt it’s time to come back now it’s been a month 😭
Oh wait! I think I've seen you guys on Jubilee
Love the opening 😂😂
u should do drive w me and my siblings and vibe to music
love the conntent pls just keep with u and your personnality u make me fell less weird bc u literlly like me thanks
As a twin I know what he means with the attachment issues lmao I had to go to a new school without my sister it was the scariest moment of my life 🤌
you should try to bake a cake on ur own lmao
I just know that car has the comfiest vibes.
I can relate with you having anxiety stuff. Don’t be hard on yourself on your first few videos. You’ll get better as you go. I think it takes a lot to get online and do what you are doing. Maybe try a little bullet point type note attached to the steering wheel so no one can see it. It’ll help keep you on track but it’s ok to ad lib. We love you and your attachment issues as you called it is pretty natural as triplets. It’s not a bad thing!! I am a twin and we are similar in our relationship to yours. We are going on 17.
thank god that he ate the camera and I love him 😂 ❤
I hate that he thinks that he is boring cs honestly his calmness and honesty brings a little peace of mind to anyone that is currently going thru stuff. I absolutely love Chris and Nick but a little Matt time makes me happy.
there’s a vlogger (ash kabosu) and he makes monthly vlogs at the end of the month that is just a clip compilation of the month.. could be a cool way to post vlogs even when ur always with the other two:)
Do mukbangs!!! I loved sitting here eating my supper feeling like we were hanging out lol
You've been my favourite since day one! Btw talking a lot and being loud don't make you an interesting person, you might be reserved and chill but definitely waaay far from boring. 18 minute video of just talking felt like 3 minutes cause I was engaged and interested in all you had to say! You the coolest dude
I love you
i relate to matt so much. ure my fav.
I already know this will be my safe place. thank you <3
Matt is such a pure soul and it makes me happy that he is so close with his brothers bc not everyone get that bond with their siblings and it just makes me happy to see them happy yk.!
(I hope you see this). I love you so much, a lot of people do and you are worth so much more then you think. You are not “boring” your just laid back and so what? Your very comforting and you’ve helped me with a lot, which I’m very thankful for so thank you so so much.
I find this video very comforting because I too have separation anxiety with a sibling and I understand that feeling of being alone like a piece of me is missing so I can relate to what you say a lot also your doing amazing so far with your channel and give an overall chill vibe that’s cool to watch so ya👍🏼good job
❤️
I wanna be like best friends with him idk why he calls himself boring he’s actually is really interesting
Yes pls do anxiety I literally have such bad anxiety. And I never hear anyone talk about struggles with it.
Matt saying he’s boring hurts my heart, I really want Matt to know how happy he makes us and how he talks about anxiety and things helps us and I really want him to know how many people love him,Matt has just helped me so much in life and others too.🫶🏻
anxious, thinks there boring, doesn't like to be alone, doesn't know what to do- me everyday of my exsistence. love you matt, you do you and express your individuality not only here but in ur day to day(deal w ur attachment issues )❤ also i know that everyone in the comments is saying this but your not bland or boring, your just more chill, and everyone here who is supporting you likes your for that
i would like to see content of ur own person, i feel like ur such an interestimg individual ✨
Someone needs to give him a hug and say he is not boring like that's so sad bro
no way i’m the same height as you as a 14 yr old girl 💀
you make a lot of sense Matt don’t worry, we love you I’m sure everyone is really excited for your future videos as long as it’s something you love and makes you happy we’re gonna love it
Why is Matt so sweet and adorable he might be my favorite now
i feel so comfortable like if i was having a bad day i would come to your channel because i feel like i would not feel so alone and of course in the future. Hearing him talk about being boring with out other people i almost broke because i relate so much .  Matt is such a nice funny person and i am so excited
please keep posting these when you feel like it!! i’m excited to hear the mental health talks and more and i loved this!!
No need to change anything, I enjoyed it 👍🏽
I love everything about this video
i love u
*I used to be actively watching on YouTube daily when someone uploads a video, now I watch when I can.*
You can do movies or shows tier lists
The amount of women in the comments is heavenly lmao
You are already doing amazing and you will only get better. Don’t overthink it 💖💖
😭
You are really cool and funny most of the time I watch you 😭😭😩
i fell asleep to his voice 🥰
I have two siblings as well, i'm the middle child lol. I feel the same way! i'm trying to get out in the world bit more now that i've graduated high school. I feel like i'm pretty bland because of my social anxiety too. if anyone is going through feelings like this just know that you aren't alone! we're all in this together! *high school musical reference*
ok so i just found out ab you having a personal channel i think you need to have twitter because there you could get way more ideas!!. also yes please talk ab anxiety because sometimes i forget that im not alone in this :)
Matt calling himself boring, I'm like Matt no your the reason why I'm smiling everyday and your the reason why I'm not really anxious that much because he has help me so much in so many ways I'm just depressed all the time until I met Matt, Chris and Nick and I'm happy I met them. MATT KEEP THE AMAZING WORK
matt locking the car at 2:02 when he notices the person walking is me
He’s not boring like he said.. On the contrary, I felt it was fun to see him talking about himself and to know him well (how he feel how he think ) it’s so good Matt go ahead that was so good ❤️❤️
Hi
Hey Matt! it would be awesome to see you play the new game the quarry!!!
you’re so understandable, like feeling boring as yourself. which you’re not by the way matt but i know that exact feeling. like some people don’t need to even try and they are just so interesting and can say the right things at the right time. it’s hard to explain but ugh you’re great
shoutout jimmy
Matt I love u so much your my comfort person <3, And ur not boring,love u, u honestly help me so much.
I feel safe here. Matt is definitely my comfort triplet <3
Most honest person. Love you 😂💓
When is nick when i need him.
he alr had me laughing within 2 words 😭😭😭
stop. I love how like each 3 minutes theirs just clips of him realizing a bunch of bs that we don’t even care about. Like bruh stop thinking about it sm. Your not boring dawg. Entertaining asl 😭
This video helped me understand I'm not the only one who feels that way I relate to Matt and tysm for making this video and make more
I love that your going to touch on anxiety!!!! I also deal with it everyday and it sucks so it will be nice to hear your experience with it because I can feel alone as no one around me struggles with it and it sucks when I can’t sleep at night. And also your nowhere close to boring you have a soothing voice that is nice to listen to as background kinda like a audio book in a way. Well can’t wait to see more of you videos! Hope you have a happy day!👍💕
POV: The first time hearing Matt talking for this long.
I would like day in the life videos
if you dont like it then dont eat it😭😭😂
I am the Matt of my siblings maybe it’s a middle child thing.
Everything he said is the most relatable thing. Exactly how I feel and I sometimes hate to admit but it’s all a learning process.
Matt, what happened to you and your brothers account? It says it has been terminated!!!
I can see that u don't know how cool and interesting u r and that's so BAD
i love u
Who is this dude? Is this that little huddy guy?
dude the fucking music and pink captions of Matt just beating himself up make me laugh so hard everytime  i love you dude we need more vids
i have attachment issues with u and ur brothers too. constantly on ur yt😭
the amount of times u have said “you know what i mean” and i reponded with “yes” like as if we were having a real conversation. i’m so glad u made a personal channel matt. i loveeee when u talk about urself and things u go/been through. ILY

Loved this but why can I see your guys channel it’s not showing up

Anyone else wishing they would post the new video on one of their own channels… 😔😭
You could try going to the store and buying stuff for a cake then baking it. I know it’s been done with Chris and nick but I personally feel like it could be super funny!
okay someone please answer me can they get their account back cuz I noticed they haven't uploaded yet today and I go check their channel and its fucking gone and I wanna cry
Um guys why did the sturnilio triplets delete their yt channel..
OMG WHY DID YOU GUYS DELETE YOUR GROUP CHANNEL?!
Something I love about you and your brothers is how you articulate your thoughts!!  I can never fucking do that in normal convo💀I speak so fast and I’m thinking a million things a minute haha especially if it’s something that excites me. But in general I speak so fast or I just have nothing to say at all because I’m socially awkward 😭💀
Did you guys delete the triplet channel
hey Matt! what happened to u guys' main account? I can't seen to find it and neither can many ppl so did yall get banned or what :((???
stop calling urself boring !! ur cool asf
What happened to their YouTube channel the shared one
What happened to their group account?????
Your not boring!🙌🏻😱
Matt what happened to the main channel?
hearing him call himself boring makes me so upset he is so sweet and just makes my day better with every video i watch with him in it. He is so funny i love him so much.
hi guys tell me if am i the only one who cant find their channel. every night i watchd their videos i am sad i cant find them rn.
Hello
here after their group account got terminated 😕
I can’t find there shared acc 😭
WHERE IS THE ACOUNT WHERE DID IT GO
DID YOIR GROUP CHANNEL GET BANNED?!?
Why isn’t your videos coming up?!
Isitjust me or did the main channel with all three of them disappear because I typed it up and nothing popped up but it did yesterday
Don't rush yourself into it, you'll do just fine when you get more used too it. Super proud of you Matt, I relate too you with anxiety, mine is the small and minor things too. You just keep doing do you 💚
i have bad anxiety too, it's manly social anxiety but both, also why was the triplets account cancelled
MATT YOUR SHARED ACCOUNT WITH CHRIS AND NICK GOT TERMINATED!!!!! NOOOOO
What is the triplets channel I literally can’t find it
What happened to the tripplets account? I literally can’t find it. Did they delete it?
NICK WOULD HAVE BEEN PETRIFIED AT 2:00! There was someone walking behind the car
Bro,there YouTube acc got terminated I’m literally in shock right now
Matt what happened to the group channel ?
What happened to the other channel
Who’s here after their group channel got banned? 😭
matt you are so funny without even trying bro like honestly and also,…your my fav triplet🤭‼️
who is here bc their youtube channel is terminated :(
at least we still have this video 😭😭
You should do the anxiety video I think I'd be interesting
What happened to your guys main?
i don’t know if my youtube is acting up but apparently you’re guys yt channel got terminated and i’m a bit scared-
Please tell me why YouTube banned y'all main account
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TRIPLET CHANNEL
you could make like movie or show commentaries
he’s definitely not boring i watch the videos really for him because he’s hilarious
it soothes me to hear about anxiety because it makes me feel okay. i would love it even if you talked about it for hours
hes like a comfort person n this channel is definitely gonna be my safe place
When I first watched the main triplet channel, and matts anxiety was brought up, I was never happier. Having someone who bring entertainment but can also be relatable is so huge, especially because I'm still young asf. I hope matt realizes that he alone is enough for us to watch and to enjoy, and I'm so fricken excited for more of his alone videos.
You should try doing vlogs on different days than the group channel. And just show everything your doing even if it includes Nick and Chris🤷🏻‍♀️
MATT! U ain’t boring!!! Ur literally amazing. Ur personality is so relatable to me.
5:48 No you dont !!!!!!
You are my favorite actually
matt you arent boring trust me 😭 ur alot of peoples’ comfort person + v important to us <3
just waiting on chris now. love you all
I genuinely love just sitting listening to him talk and him not trying to rush himself makes me sad because of how much anxiety he has with out his brothers and he just needs some time to adjust doing this by himself and it is hard for him and it will be at first but he’ll adjust to it so don’t rush him and make him overwhelmed
it’s definitely a lot more chill but it’s DEFINITELY not boring— love the little comments it’s really funny <3
honestly i think it's great that you guys are starting channels alone because you'll get to discover yourself appart from mattew and christopher and be more comfortable roaming the world on your own.
slay
I moved to my mum half a year ago while my brother stayed at my dad’s place so I kind of understand what he means with it like feeling off and stuff without Nick and Chris but at the same time I don’t think how I felt and how he feels really compares to each other since they are such different situations. But uh yeah, I kind of get what he means. For information my mum lives across the country from my dad. My brother and I are really close and I guess I was scared that would go away?  But as I said this is a complete different situation and I do not have a twin or triplet etc so I won’t ever really understand.
if you play video games it would be awesome if you could make those too
And Matthew you are not boring you seem very fun to me and interesting so keep pushing towards this idea and make any video that comes to mind.
Hiiiii I'm new to this channel I subscribed too I also watch the channel with your brothers I really like those videos.  if you could soon make a video about how you deal with your anxiety because I have a twin brother and he helps me deal with it and it would be a great video if you shown how you cope with anxiety.
matt you've NEVER ever been boring and i see that you're still growing and slowly stepping out your comfort zone :( we love u
i don't want it to sound weird, but because of your anxiety and just your way of being i attached myself to you very quickly and it got me here on your channel and i can't wait for your videos, whatever they may be about... i just love your person
Yeah Matt this was great!!! You are a very cool person, can’t wait for more Matt content :)
When he said he had attached to Chris and nick my heart had melted it’s not everyday a sibling says that about their other siblings
matt i’m not sure if you’ll see this but we do not care what you do. we love you guys and just love hearing you talk.💗
matt is definitely not boring he is calming and relaxing to watch when you want a chill video. he’s more down to earth. but also when you do drive alone you should do driving vlogs or videos
Matt is for me the most relatable sibling I have anxiety and attachment issues and I relate to him so much, I hate it when he calls himself boring like he's not at all even if he isn't with nick and chris he's funny and so loved from us I personally love him so much that I've even build attachment issues towards him which sounds pretty cringe but jts true I can't go on a day without watching him/them
I LOVE YOU SO FUCKING MUCH
it hurts me sm when he says that he’s boring without nick and chris bc he’s so adorable as an individual. I’m also really excited for the anxiety videos bc i believe that it’s so important to be talking ab mental health issues and stuff. Ily matt<3
Love you Matthew!!!!! #1!
Dude I only clicked this bc I was shocked likeeee
2:02 did anyone else see that man walking in the background??
i just realized i have the exact same jordan zip up hoodie as him👀👀👀👀
i like this video so much. it’s my third time watching it, nothing weird, i just think that i like how innocent you are sometimes and it warms my heart. you just talk about anything that comes on your mind so it’s giving a natural and honest talk. i love it. you’re not boring.
I loved watching this video i have really bad anxiety and i like that you talk about it openly. My sister always calls me the boring one so im glad im not the only one 😭😭
Make a gaming video plz
I am so proud of you matt,you are my comfort person and you always help me with all my problems by just listening to your videos.Love you!!!
4:35 i love when he says “i have attachment issues with chris and nick” so wholesome 💘
Good job.
I feel like I would listen to a podcast of Matt
The fact that he locked the car upon seeing person at the back. He is very cautious! That's good bro! 💪
It feels like we have the same problem
LMAOO THE EDITING IS KILLING ME
Aww I love you Matt you aren’t boring at all. Also I know the feeling of something being brought up and remembering a good memory or moment that happened relating to it.
Please post more videos in here!! Want to know everything!
so grateful for you🫂
I loving this already  it feels like we are having a conversation of what you wanted to say and feels nice to have that, I don't have anyone to talk to meaning no one have time for each other anymore and I needed something like this so thank you
5:37 : it's really help me a lot, cause i don't know what i'm gonna do until told"   First of all, Matt, you are not bad as you said because for me your personality is pretty good. I mean-- i often focus on you than Nick and Chris, and i am fully aware that you are quite, but you are really good at treating your two broters! You always keep attention for them, i love it! You barely talk and just laugh for what Nick and Chris said 😭💓  Second of all, i think it's gotta be good if u make videos about cooking? Or maybe bake and stuff. I already imagine it cute!! Always remember that you are loved, Matt!
“damn i was blowing everything”😭😭😭
u should drive with mes and playlists stuff like music related videos
you are not boring, you are laid back. either way we all love you and are here to support you and your brothers. i have anxiety too, we got this<3
I can't express how proud of you I am! You went out of your comfort zone and I think that's amazing I couldn't be any prouder. I can't wait for the videos yet to come and also take your time with them. There is no need to rush or feel forced to upload if you're not up to it.  Anyways love you and keep up the amazing work <3
See I like this because normally people always say he is boring but them having different channels you can see the difference like Nick is always been my favorite but Matt is definitely up there because he feels like the one that we could have like long talks about anything and have like a heart to heart
can u pls posttttt !!!!!!
Comfort video ily <3
⭐ 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐨𝐬𝐦
i feel you matt. i think of myself as boring, alone, not entertaining much but ik i had an anxiety too. that was last yr. hearing you out made me sad rn coz i knew what it feels like. this was a good thing you did a video and sharing your feelings and thoughts for us so everyone can know that you're ok or not. luv u
We love the positive growth outlook ✌️ also the codependency and anxiety talk is feelin a bit too close to home 👀
You give me Emma Chamberlain kinda vibe, so calming and chill yet entertaining
My new safe space🤍
You relate to me sm and ily and ur not boring
i don’t think that matt is boring at all, it’s nice to see him on his own sometimes. i’m so excited for the future videos that he plans on posting 😌
Fav twin check
just pick a topic per video that you would like to talk about, and we'll love it either way :)
videos can be entertaining in many different ways, you don't necessarily need to be funny or crazy all the time. For example, emma chamberlain just makes her coffee and talks about whatever, she goes to the grocery store, etc. Just d
He is so relatable, and I love it so much.
maybe you should play scary video games, i feel like that would be really funny
Ur so relatable ilyyy
YOU ARE NOT BORING. You literally entertain me Iloveyou
I could listen to you talk for hours you’re not boring I promise 😭
I've never related more to a video, this makes me feel so comfortable, thank you Matt lmao
please please please make more mental health videos/videos talking more about your anxiety, it's definitely not talked about enough and just you willing to be open and share it with us helps me and tons of other people with our anxiety and whatever we're going through a lot. i've been really struggling with anxiety along with some other issues and you and your brothers are some of the only people that have made me feel safe and stable recently. i just wanted to thank you for doing what you've been doing and i really appreciate it:)
I did miraculously stumble across your channel independently. I'm here because I read it's your first video and I wanted to give you a chance. I'm enjoying it because you remind me of myself lol. ❤️ After listening, it sounds to me like these videos independently could help you boost your self-esteem. (Hey! 9 min in and I guess you realized it too!) 😄  Suggestions: As someone who doesn't know you and has no loyalties to gas you up, I think you should consider making your videos shorter. Like have a timer set that you try to stick to. Maybe about 10 min. It will help with your anxiety because there won't be as much pressure to perform/be entertaining for an indefinite amount of time. It'll also help you stay focused.  And this way, even if you do decide to talk aimlessly about nothing- which is fine, it won't go on for 20 minutes, making you feel boring, and making your new, personally developed audience leave early. Then, maybe extend the time as necessary when you have a specific topic that requires the extra time. It'll be easier to keep up maintaining your channel as well, if you create a reasonable and consistent time for yourself. Less to come up with. Less to edit. And when you look back on what you did, you won't just feel like you're rambling for too long, so you'll be more likely to continue, because you'll feel better about the final result.
congratulations on 100K🎉
You should prank your brothers!!
this is so comforting like emma chamberlains videos
You're still young, don't view yourself as boring! You are calmer, and that's a trait of yourself you should embrace, not see it as boring! Just be your awesome self!
Not sure why I got this in my watch feed? I dont know who you or your 2 brothers are. lol I will say its normal for you to feel a bit lost when your brothers are not with you. My family has several sets of twins and it seems like they are like that until they get a bit more autonomy (look the word up). As a part of a multiple you have to develop your own seperate likes/dislikes, hobbies, goals apart from your brothers. That doesnt mean you wont ALWAYS for life have things that you will do together  and there will always be that special bond. I hope your channel does well and I think talking about mental health will help not only yourself to grow and try new things but it will get you new subs who find you thru that search topic and it will help them as well. It could be part of your niche....good luck.
0:16 what’s the song calleddddd????
i love you so much matt and i really appreciate you 💛
I think the people that overthink things often label themselves as boring
in 17:20 did he say subscribe bby? Or maybe?🧡
One video suggestion I have for you is maybe doing a study video. I'm not sure if you're still in school or plan to go to college, but if you are, a study video could be motivation not only for you but for other students. I always watch them while I'm doing my own work because of the calming music, so I would definitely love to see some of those from you :)
We all love you Matt! You are not boring, you are far from it. I know that sometimes it feels weird to branch off and do your own thing but I know that you will continue to improve and we are looking forward to more videos and we want to see you succeed!!❤️❤️❤️
he's impacting so many people with even just this one video! i loved the whole thing he's not boring at all- he's very comforting and funny!! this channel is going to be so many people's safe space regardless of how much he uploads im so excited and proud :D
I’ll drink pickle juice out of the jar it’s amazing
i love your uninterrupted thoughts :)))
Also this channel give you some sense of independence, you can practice how to comfortably talk to yourself and get used to it, it helps your train of thought because there aren’t other people in the room that affect your opinion , also 15:07 inturnet is pretty funny
i can relate to you lowkey do more 😉👍
Hi
love him
matt  you should do a story time about your anxiety it will help loads of people who are dealing with the same stuff as you .and i can assure you that your not a boring person remember that we love you
Wow, I felt so comfortable the past 18:22 minutes. I‘d love you to keep going with those types of videos<3
yoo the editing in this is funny af matt!!!!
so so excited for more videos omg
Playlist video
i normally don’t comment on videos but i just want to say that i have anxiety too and whenever i watch videos with you, chris and nick i always feel a bit more at ease and so much better if im having a bad day. so pls don’t say you’re boring matt, you have no idea how many ppl you provide a source of comfort to and the number of ppl who feel better with your videos. fr, they would never be the same without you
YOU ARE NOT BORING
Matthew we love u omg
Bro please don’t be uncomfortable talking about your anxiety. I had anxiety for a while over peeing. I didn’t want to pee. It wasn’t a big deal and was kinda stupid and honestly very funny but that didn’t mean I wasn’t stressed by it. It’s not always depressing and people will understand that. And if it is depressing, that’s also ok. I love the idea of you talking about your anxious moments and I’m excited to hear about it!!
Can you please tell Chris that my sister page is obsessed with him 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I’m supper glad you made this video. Idk if your going to see this comment but I really enjoyed listening to you speak and want similar videos from you in the future.. I really related to this and it calmed me a lot.
the pure joy of hearing matt finish a damn thought <3
am the same when it comes to necklaces. My best fried and I have matching necklaces and I never take mine off. I’m am also sorry I am watching this so late. I haven’t been in my phone much so I’m just now watching their personal channel vids.
Matt you're not boring ... your so cute , funny and you have strong personality . You have a lot of fans and we all love you.. ..don't forget that 🤍🥺
matt you're not boring infact i think you're going to do so much good with the anxiety talk. it may help so many people to realize everyone struggles with their own problems. like me for example, i find myself relating to you alot the more you talk about it.
When you said “it’s like having two siblings then not” hit me  I don’t like being away from my twin and older sister
his energy is so comforting
c'mon ur my fav of triplets, don't say your boring bcs for me all you say is interesting
Its still making me smileee when you JUST talkkk❤i lovee youuuu🥺❤
your videos make my day feel better matt💗
Love please stop apologizing and saying you’re boring it breaks my heart. It’s really nice to hear you talk. Trust me nobody is seeing you as boring.
“keep living you life!”
YaaY MATT 🤘
Matt on his own is amazing
He ac has me crying when he said he was boring
this was such a good video, you’re an amazing person Matt and i can’t wait to see more videos from you. i definitely relate to the anxiety issue so I’d be glad if you talked more about it, ofc if you’re comfortable with that. I love you 💜
Omg this is actually lovelyyyy
DO AMONG US LOBBYS or ROBLOX PLAY it would be fun and ur amazing
You aren't a boring person
this video was genuinely so good and relatable, love you matt ❤️
matt you’re not boring at all, i know what it feels like to think you’re less than others and stuff, but i really think that you’re amazing and these comments prove that a lot of people think the same too. i’d love to listen your experience with anxiety, bc your vids are really helping me in these last weeks with it a lot, im having really bad anxiety and ik that listen to a similar experience coming from a person like you would help me. love u <33
I feel like I am you in many social circles, ur like the definition of me hahaha, same person different people :)
Don’t feel pressured to post!! It’s ok to just post for fun!!! U don’t have to post to be worthy of our attention!!! 🥰🥰
it’s ok bud I am the same with content creation and anxiety :))
I’m enjoy cause i see myself in you
matt ur my fav
Matt is literally my comfort person 😭❤️❤️
I don’t have ig so here’s my idea…  Talk abt how school was for you. How was school being a triplet. Did you like school, did you get good grades, was it fun? yk just talk abt school. or don’t… do whatever. Just talk.   Also great job on you first video i enjoyed it, i don’t really like seeing ppl get interrupted so this was nice. ok bye.
17:19 never suscribed so fast in my entire life, damn
love you so much
him talking about having attachment issues with nick and Chris made me nearly cry, I have an older brother and sister and in the past two years they have both been at home less and are pretty much living out of home now and it feels so weird and its been a huge change, it's so weird having to actually plan to see them anyways thanks for reading
i really like that you’re advocating for mental health awareness by talking abt your anxiety. i feel like there’s such a stigma around mental health with guys, but i love that you are actively talking about it. i, too, struggle with severe anxiety so i would love to hear your experience with it. <3 love you
i LOVE your humour
The pain I felt when he said he was boring I don’t think you realize how important you are Matt ❤️
ur not boring u actually are really entertaining and cool!
ISTG UR EDITING IS SO FUNNIII I CANT CONTROL MYSELF OF LAUGHTER 😭
2:00 okay- but that person who passed by scared me to death idk 🧍🏽‍♀️
As someone with anxiety, I really appreciate how chill he is. I enjoy listening to him talk about himself and just things in general. This content is really comforting because I also don’t really do much with other people and sometimes you just wanna feel like you have someone with you, or like you’re hanging out with someone to feel less alone. Thank you Matt!<3
Awee don't say your boring your literally so nice.
he is so comforting, i love it
i love this
PLEASE DO VIDEO GAMES
Mat is not boring
I lloveee you Matt!!! You look like so much Nick in this video!!!!!!
i hope he realizes how much it helps people like me who enjoy calming talking vids like this and needs a place to unwind after watching a really chaotic and loud video of them all together <3 i appreciate both content jus as much and both are immensely beneficial for me and my mental health to develop distractions by watching videos like HE & they create!
matt calling himself boring made me so genuinely upset because he makes me laugh so hard and his personality is just so big he cannot be boring
It is so sad that your saying your boring,  you helped me in a time where i was struggling and now because of you i have started to make friends and things like that well done for talking about your anxiety i am still struggling with that tho love you so much, thank you!❤
not boring at all! you can relax about that. video idea: maybe do a cook/bake with me and chat while youre doing that:)
MATT! MATT! MATTY B! MATTHEW GRAY GUBLER 2.0! ONLY TRIPLET WITH A LICENSE! VIDEO IDEA PLS  if you did a ‘learning how to paint from bob ross’ like watch a bob ross video and try to replicate the painting I LOVE YOU!<3
17:03 “clothing anxiety…….. welp you guys will have to tell me I already forgot that”. I laughed that was funny. You are really funny Matt you just don’t see it yet. The ending was really funny too🥰 have a nice day night evening
16:30 I think you’re creative  , I would really like to see you do some creative things
I’m really interested in your channel and getting to know you better 🤍 There’s a lot of cool ideas you can do  I’m glad you did this, It’s actually exciting .
Don't beat yourself up so much it's your first video alone! It can take awhile to find a style you like, and I know people will be patient and give you time to experiment! You're doing great!
You’re probably not gonna see this Matt, but because you made this video; it made me realize how much I resonate with you personally.   I always thought that I resonated with Nick the most, but because you decided to make a video alone; I realized “ dang, Mathew is someone that gets me”.  Keep, smiling and know that you’re not alone wherever you go. You taking time out of your day, is probably gonna help a lot people.
pov Matt brings Nick and Chris on his a first date w someone
I LOVE MATT OH MY GOD
matt sounded spanish when he said internet
5’8 on a good day! Hahaha
i love matt so much. <3
Matt breaks my heart when he says he boring, he entertains me be being there and making my day. I love Matt so much and im so excited to watch him grow as a person, Be yourself and I love you Matt❤
Whoever ever says that he is boring, is probably just jealous. Matt you are amazing and we love you ❤
I love you so much
Don't tell the others but you're my favourite
I love the idea of anxiety talks, because a lot of people struggle with it like myself, and it would be amazing. I also well probably watch whatever you want to post I love watching everything!!!
Matt is such a pure soul i love him so much. He’s the complete opposite. This channel is going to become my comfort place
Honestly i love videos where teen creators talk about mental health stuff and their experiences in life and such things. It just makes me feel not alone y'know? So i know your videos are gonna be amazing and peaceful for me. And when you said i have attachment issues i felt that. Cuz when I'm with my friends i feel pretty amazing but when i got home i feel like we're not friends anymore like i just feel so lonely y'know. And i feel like i have no personality or life since i feel empty without other people (my friends) around. But i know I'm not cuz if i were personalityless then my friends wouldn't be friends with me. But y'know, my brain likes to fuck itself up i guess lmao.  I hope you see this so you don't feel like you won't be good at this Youtube thing and people won't like you. I assure you people will love your channel and you.
mathew nobody thinks youre boring bestie. also i really think people would appreciate the anxiety video :)
ahh i loved the video it not planed at all it so genuine and at least i get everything u tried to weirdly explain. a lot of us have the same way to explain or try to talk about feelings so yea don’t worry we got everything. its new type of videos might be hard at first but I personally like it and im waiting for the next one
ur not boring matt we love you <3
HI MATTTTT ILY
he’s just like me fr
I understand everything you said that’s how I am
I love how he talks about his anxiety. I’ve had anxiety for basically my whole life and I love how he can talk about it so easily I guess. He makes me feel good about having anxiety if that makes sense lol. I love talking about how I experience anxiety to people which may seem weird to some but y’know. One day if I ever start posting videos I will definitely talk about anxiety and how it impacts my life. We love you Matt <3
MAKE MORE VIDEOS I LOVED ITTTT
ily 💗
i just love him bro
“cause i don’t have nick interrupting me and i don’t have chris yelling at me” god that was so sad but i can relate to it so much
lol i was dying when you said “so i didn’t even give myself time to eat” 😂😂 but matt we love you and you’re not boring stop!! you could literally make a video just sitting there and i’d watch LMFAO🫶🏾
no cause I love listening to you talking about ur anxiety cause I have had anxiety since like a young age and hearing someone else's perspective is really eye-opening yk
i don't think ur bland u kinds just need to find your own thing then I think ur vids will be fabulous
That's so me...Matt saw some guy walking in the background and immediately locked the car. :')
First off,  Matt I think you're very entertaining. You remind me of me sometimes and it makes me feel happy and normal to see someone else have the same thoughts or mindsets that I do. Which is why I love watching Chris, Nick and you it's like three of my different moods coming together. I love it!
love the editing matt
i feel like i have attachment issues too with my twin lol
i hope this channel makes you more confident. you’re a chill individual, doesn’t mean ur boring. excited to see where this goes :)
you mentioned that you're mom was religious in one of your videos. Maybe talk about if there was an  impact that religion had on your life or dicuss like spiritual stuff
I feel like Matt’s channel will give the same vibe as Emma chamberlain’s
you’re not boring<3
I have a twin sister and I totally agree with what Matt said. It's like being incomplete if I am not with my twin sister. We are trying to get used to doing things that we love, alone. We had this agreement and it actually seems to be working. Btw I have an anxiety about this right now and I saw this in my recommendation. Thank you for making such wonderful videos❤️
Can u make a video  of a day in your life ples
matt ur not boring! i love u and I feel safe here
You’re interesting. We love you.
I smiled this entire video love seeing Matt being able to talk and get his point across
I’m so happy to see you started this channel.  I hope you can talk about everything you feel like you need to talk about like anxiety and other things you want to talk about. You are not boring and I can tell that you have a lot to share with your fan base. Love you and I hope you don’t let pressure get to you and that you keep up with this channel. All love ❤️
te amo no eres aburrido
I come here everyday
i love this guy so much, matty b im your biggest fan
i keep coming back to this video all the time. i could literally listen to you talk for hours, you’re the most comforting person ever and such a beautiful human being. you’ve helped me so much in such a short space of time, you make me feel so much more comfortable with myself and with the fact that it’s okay to have anxiety and not feel good all the time.  words can’t express how thankful i am to you and how much i appreciate you, you mean the world to me. i love you so much matt <3
That "upp looks like I forgot" I felt that 😭
I don't know why, but for me it is weird that there are people with not much or no anxiety. How?  And it sounds so sad when he calls himself ''boring''. He isn't. Otherwise i wouldn't watch his whole video.
I LOVED THIS
he is FAR from boring. he just gets overlooked by the other two:/
ok matt ur funny ill sub
DAMMM HE WAS BLOWING EVERYTHING
Matt, I will personally fly over to you and smack some confidence into you! You are an amazing, incredible, and super talented/not boring human being! There are so many people who want to hear about you and your day, even the stuff that you find boring or weird! You are a safe place for so many so try your best and do whatever makes you feel comfortable! :)
Go Matt you got it ❤️
LOOK AT THIS VIDEO OF THE TRIPLETS WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE 😭😭 https://youtu.be/vVEHGnjCqB0
🤍🤍
Dude I honestly loved this so much!
Here is a piece of non-asked advice and constructive critisism: you might get your thoughts in order and put them out more smoothly if you relax and talk to us as if we were your friends . And don't worry, I undrrstand that feeling , I am hella atached to my twin sister. Love the video and I think you are really funny and you have a great personality! Like sorry if is inapropied but I would definitly date you if I knew you in person and if I wasn't 17 or lived in another continent but whatever usual stuff (damm , my longest comment ever)
No cause I actually got the attachment issues part bc I’m also a triplet so Ik what u mean
i love you i love you
You should cook something for one of your videos
hes so funny without even trying bro like the editing is so hilarious LMAOO
I love youuuu 100% and I think this vid was great. I love how open you are to us and how you want to make content for us to enjoy!!! But always remeber that it isn’t ALL about what we want bc Ik you can really make some great vids on your own… like this one! Much love ❤️❤️ *Def subscribed and have the post notifications on*🥳🥳
im so happy the boys are deciding to do their own channels somewhat because I feel like we don't really know them individually as well as we do them as triplets so this will give us a better understanding of them and what they are like. im also so proud of Matt for doing this because even though he claims himself as "boring", I thoroughly enjoyed listening to him talk and be so open and honest with us. and Matt if you ever need a snack break, we will all take one with you. we can listen to a song or two and eat our snacks lol
You're literally awesome can't wait to see more of your videos!
You're amazing ❤️☺️ , thank you for take the time to do this , I know it's no easy for you , I have anxiety many time in the day but nobody believes me 😔 sometimes I feel like something's wrong with me , but your voice actually relax me . So thanks and keep going 💖
Hey matt don’t know if your going to see this or not. But you are the most relatable person ever. I don’t really watch youtube all the time but when I watch the sturniolio vids i relate to u sm. Idk if your getting this from other people but you have such a comforting presence. Like you don’t try and act like something your not and i really appreciate that. Anyways yuhh that’s it i had a random burt at to comment. I usually never comment on youtube videos but i felt like i HAD to lmao. Pleas see this cause know my thumb hurts from typing this 🙃
the rings thing thooo i honestly feel the same way.. same with bandaids tho 😨😨
yess when someone brings up a memory and it unravels into other memories you forgot about
omg i completely relate with the ring thing
id love the anxiety talks, i totally relate and it would be really comforting to hear someone else talking about it
matt nobody thinks you’re boring. you’re naturally really funny, even individually without nick or chris. you’re so kind tbh you just seem like an all around comforting, fun person to be around. anyways cant wait to see your content on this account! you got this just be yourself as everyone already loves you for you :))🤍
this was entertaining asl
I would really like to hear more from you about your experiences and you could speak about anything for hours and I would be entertained so don’t be too scared about posting a boring video cause I would like anything🤍😄❤️
i love how everyone is y'know sad that matt called himself boring but I REALLY CAN'T GET OVER THIS LINE I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT IT'S SO FUNNY TO ME 15:28 AND THIS LINE 15:36
Matttttt, you are not boring omg get it in your head that you aren’t a boring person alone, if you think that it’s because you live with two v big personalities that you seem to be slightly louder than so you don’t get a word in.  You are NOT Boring 😘
Him complaining about the camera not focusing and then says “where is nick when I need him” is just wholesome. That’s brotherly love❤️
Anyone else realise how similar he looks and sounds to nick compared to their shared Chanel?
matt ilysm ur not boring your my favourite person ever.
the instrument blowing thing is sooo funny lmaooo😭
I'm an introvert person and your videos will really help me keeping company to all of us out there! Keep up with your channel and don't ever think again that you're boring!! We love you❤❤
2:43 4:16
Watch some videos of Emma chamberlain and reproduce them as you want! You goooo Matt!!
you are not boring at all. you have impacted so many peoples lives. you are so important to so many people <3
matt your perfect and i loved listening to you talk. i’ll be waiting for the next video whenever your ready :).
I am a twin, so I think being a triplet has to be even more complex. After watching all your and your brothers' videos, finding out about your anxiety makes me think you are very sensitive, and I think in this kind of sibling relationship some characters can be shadowed so I can relate to that. The videos with your brothers are very funny and chaotic, I love them, but also some peaceful introspection is comforting and it can help all of you grow. All of you are wonderful human beings!!! I hope to hear awesome news from you and wish all the success you strive for!!! Lots of love ❤️❤️❤️
TIME TO BRING BACK THE CAMERA KISSES!!!
this video did not just get 43.9 k dislikes they don't deserve you matt
you genuinely are not boring!!! think about it. hundreds of thousands of people go out of their way to make sure they’re able to watch your videos, because they care and find you interesting! we love u matt❤️‍🔥
Don’t underestimate yourself you’re way better than you think, and I’m excited for your next videos💗
Matt, you're not boring, you're just more laid back ❤ We recognize how your individual personalities are through your group vids and if any of us thought you're boring, we wouldn't be here :)
OMGGGG HOTTTT AAAAAA
he's so relatable bye.
It breaks my heart when you say your boring you really aren’t. This is a chance you and us your supporters to get to know you better. Your so amazing and unique. And it’s maybe awkward because your not with your brothers. But don’t beat yourself up over it 🤗.
5:48 No you don’t !!!!!!
just talking about how youtube has changed you or you thought process and just talking about you feelings because i love listening and relating to peoples feelings!
why did this make me cry? like hearing him talk down on himself makes me sad. like i know that i think i’m not a very interesting person either, but hearing him say these things makes me kinda upset which is pretty hypocritical, but i just think that a person that i look up to and someone who always puts a smile on my face feels the same way i do.
any vids I will love 😎😎 your personality is so awesome and I can’t wait to see you grow :) slay
I really love how real you are in this video. I have anxiety too. I liked this and hope you continue.
You’re just chill compared to your brothers. And the way you feel when they’re not there I feel like is very normal. Also I like hearing you talk about your anxiety because I can relate and it’s fun.
You need to do your top tattoo ideas or a tour. I’m trying to find ideas for my own
Man I thought you were wonderful
i would love seeing a video on anxiety talks as someone with anxiety too! so much comfort radiates off of you and i hope you know how much it helps when feeling overwhelmed
matt you’re not "boring", you're laid back, chill, and low key. you have a GREAT sense of humor but some people may find you boring, the people who tell you you're not boring mean it, we all love and support you!
I love you
The intro is the cutest thing ive ever seen in my life
matt is just adorable i could here him talk for hours
hi matt! i love you so much you’re doing great❤️
Your just a comfort place for a lot of us
You r not boring!!! You are an incredible young man who have a goal in his life your personality is amazing and fun we love u matt🫶🏻💕
OH MY GOSH MATT finally man
i honestly love matt by himself like we can actually hear what he has to say for once
THE LITTLE ADD INS THAT SAY STUFF HAVE ME CRYING
matt you’re not boring you’re awesome
matty boy, ily. i really appreciate you being open about your anxiety. please take your time, whether that be a video every month or every 3. no matter what, we’ll be here for you. i know you say you’re boring & trust me, i feel the exact way but you truly are so fucking funny LMFAOOO and you bring a lot to the table that you may not think you do. if a personal channel ends up being something you enjoy, awesome, but if not, it’s okay and completely understandable. please never feel like you have to force yourself or do things that don’t make you happy. 🤍
Why is this fandom so dramatic 😭
You are not boring at all. It hurts a lot hearing you day that. I think you add a lot to the vídeos, without you It wouldnt be the same. We love you a lot. Don't think that stuff. You are amazing
Matt, this video was so great and you're most definitely not boring. I can't wait to see more of your videos <3
matt you are doing amazing don’t worry
As someone who has severe anxiety, thank you thank you thank you for wanting to be open about your struggles with anxiety. I think we are progressing as a society to being more open about our struggles with mental health, but not nearly enough.
heck yeah im  so excited to get to know you more matt !!! here for the quality time ahhaa <33
I would love you to do deeptalks about important stuff, like your anxiety etc...
as a triplet, i completely understand the first 5mins of the video. i feel incomplete without my siblings.
when he said video game stuff i instantly thought of him playing omori and im SO EXCITED to get content like that maybe??
I would appreciate a video on driving anxiety so bad  I have a whole list of reasons why I shouldn’t be allowed to drive but because one of my friends passed away last year in an accident I’ve been putting it off for as long as I can. Plus in general just have no sense of direction or spatial awareness so I would just be a menace to society if I was allowed to drive 💀
this was so fun
matt Is an icon
Matt:subscribe baby Me:"Click"👁️👄👁️❤️‍🔥
sending hugs🫂💙
aww matt had to make his own bc he would get yelled at or ignored by nick and  chris when they make video and he also getting left out🥲
i'm so excited for this personal channel i've really wanted to see and hear more of matt i think he's really interesting and i like hearing him talk
We love you Matt!!
the way me and this man are the same person is crazy
I love matt in a non relationship way you know.I also love to see him get out of his comfort zone and get out and talk by him self.
you’re too mean to yourself!
It's scary how quiet it is😲
Gosh i love him
matt you're our safe place. we'll appreciate everything you do <3
Have nick nd chris rate ur fits or like put on the dumbest shit🙏🏽🙏🏽
i have never heard someone else explain the rings feeling heavy + claustrophobia feeling when wearing rings like Matt talking about anxiety is so comforting because my anxiety is so similar to his. a big thankyou to matt<3
You are far better at this solo thing than you give yourself credit for. You’re engaging, interesting, and have meaningful perspectives. Looking forward to hearing from you as you feel like filming. You’re doing great! 🤘👊
i feel like i can relate so much as i was the uninteresting friend in high school and that lead to people not wanting to hangout with me because i was “boring” but it was mostly because of my anxiety i was scared to try new things or to speak up in conversations…. and i doubt myself
The fact he called himself boring shows that people on the internet(maybe irl idk) who say those type of things. Matt isn’t boring. He is just as fun as Chris and Nick. I’m actually excited to watch his new videos and see how different one triplet is when they’re split up. 😂
its like a talkshow i love it
I love u Matt and ur not boring ur the opposite of that
no way
“DAMN I WAS BLOWING EVERYTHING” TOOK ME OUT LMFAOOOO
matt i love you sm :(
You could make a video over the course of a month of you learning a new skill or topic and and the end of the month you test that skill and reflect on the experience.
matt, you truly are not a boring person! i thoroughly enjoyed this video, i think its great you guys want to do this with your own channels and do your own things while still doing the car videos! i'd love to hear you talk about your anxiety, because I also struggle with it so it would be nice to hear and be reminded that it's not just me dealing with it because I forget a lot of the time.
Love that you’re opening up and I think that talking about anxiety would really help me, as well as MANY other people that struggle with it! Thank you so much and even just making your own channel is a big step that is amazing!!❤️
“damn i blow everything” oh matt 😂
this vid was so cute and his editing 🤌🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻 HAHAHAAHA
love you matt
I literally love u sm I relate to ur comments abt ur thoughts n how u forget them halfway
I’m in middle school and I’m taller than u damn
I played the cello for 4-5 years. You should do a video of you playing the instrument’s you play when you were younger to see if you could play them again
Relate so much to the anxiety talked about in this video 💗 I’m an identical triplet and whenever I’m alone I feel weirdly the same, I just feel weird and not like myself it’s hard to explain but I understand exactly what your saying.   Being a triplet is a blessing but also can be a lot sometimes
New fan :) u sound like such a kind and relatable person. Cant wait for ur future vids!!!!
oh my god
This video was so chill, you don't need to be doing cartwheels to entertain us you're already a vibe
I LOVE YOU
ideas:   yes, YES, maybe, yes, YES, yes. thats all!! hope this helps! we love you Matt!
Pleaseeeeee do story times from your childhood it would soooo cool I am a big fan and I would love to hear about your childhood.
matt don't call yourself boring :( you're anything but boring! i really am so proud that you found the courage to make your own youtube channel and actually post a video. so so proud of you, keep up the amazing work i love you <33
ur the cutest ever
Looking forward for your sit down videos🙌🏾
You're not boring at all Matt, actually i feel really good seeing you talkind like this and taking your space to talk about whatever comes up to your mind. I specifically love how open are you with your anxiety bc i suffer with it too and befor knowing you i thought no one could ever understand the things i was going trought. Keep it up, love you🤍
i love how trasparent Matt is, i want to be his friend so bad. <3
everything you say is very relatable
HIS EDITING IS AMAZING HE HAD ME LAUGHING EVERY TIME
Was his nose bleeding
Your voice is so soothing, I really liked your video :)
❤❤❤
matt you are not boring.
Matt! I'm so excited for this chapter in you're life! I actually loved this video so much! it was super relatable, i loved seeing like how you in you're own habitat it super interesting. i'm proud of you!  keep it up!
as a twin, i 100% relate. life’s weird without them
The number of times I can just watch this when I'm feeling down is unbelievable. The wholesomality and the preciousness of this video is absolutely incredible.
its so cute how he relies on Nick and Chris but you can also tell how he completes them. GO MATT!!!!! he is so comforting and should not be nervous about this. we are here for you. ❤❤❤💖
You're doing great!!!! Keep going
a day in the life sounds great!!!
you are so entertaining
you should do this or that questions from the comments!
love matt
your doing great!
Great first vid! You should definitely do a morning routine and even though Ik you live with Chris and nick but the camera will be on you and your routine.
o Matt falando, que orgulho         *brincadeira*
I think he is labeling himself as boring because compared to his brothers he is more laid back. I don’t see him as being boring, i see him more as a calming support to Nick and Chris’s chaotic energy. 🧡
matt is my favourite personally an i luv this :)
the fact that i drink pickle juice out of the jar made this 100% more funnier
lol the "Outro"
I can relate to matt on so many levels because I have anxiety to and I think it’s really good to be open and honest about it and share how you feel but I do not think matt is bland at all I mean he’s not the funniest but he is like the most down to earth and that is really nice to see a little bit of calm in like a pit of madnesses
I LOVED THIS VIDEO SND HOW ITS JUST YOU THIS IS AN AMAZING IDEA AND ANKIETY SUBJECT FOR VIDEOS IS SO GOOD
Having attachment issues to siblings or pets makes an everyday life without those who you have these attachment issues to hard or anxiety based. And honestly having someone else like you, or someone else in these comments talking about attachment issues makes me feel better. I feel like no one really talks about it. Talking about attachment issues , it feels weird to not be around my sister or dog. 😕
"you get them when you get them" and "you don't get them when you don't get them" got me flying
the lack of interrupting was actually so pleasant to watch lmao <3
The pause and the classic music playing the comment oml 13:24
💕
matt ik you believe you’re fine, and maybe you are, but i am asking you from the bottom of my heart to please talk to someone, even just for an hour. k luv u.
Your not boring Matt,and yes I would love to see a video about you talking about your anxiety and stuff I’ll watch anything you post babe❤️
Ily
The intro Hah!! When nick isn't there
matt calling himself boring makes me feel like i’m not the only person who feels like that. matt makes me feel comfortable and i’m so happy you are opening up to us. love you matt!!!
its literally so sad u think ur boring w out them but as the awkward anxious all the time friend i feel like im boring alone also if that makes sense
thank you so much for this matt, im so excited to see where you take this channel ❤️ love you so so so much 💛
Proud of you
HELP?? I WAS LOOKING AT THE COMMENTS AND WHEN I WENT BACK TO THE VIDEO IT WAS AT THE "DAMN I WAS BLOWING EVERYTHING" PART SO I SAID "what" AND STARTED LAUGHING LMAOSDCJKLD
pranks!!
matt we literally love you with everything we have, promise you aren’t a boring person. ❤️
Don't tell Nick and Chris this but you've always been my favourite Lol I know it sounds corny but something about you is so comforting to me and I always want to hear what you have to say (ik it sounds like bullshit) but yeah im excited for this channel !!
You’re not boring WE LOVE YOU!❤️
i loved this so much i felt so much comfort from this video too
omg you should make videos with madi once her channel is up & running.
“sees the guy walking…. locks door”
I’m actually so excited for you to have your own channel!! You seem like such a nice person and just chill vibes overallll. I love the way you talk about things, just very chill and open! Keep it uppp
this is such a safe place 4 me, matt you have explained some things so much better than i can describe. you really are amazing i love u omg
cooking with Matt
matt dont bring urself down and say ur boring ur literally my comfort person and i could watch u watch paint dry and i would be entertained. i know its weird doing videos without ur brothers and it could be awkward in the beginning but i think these videos and anxiety talk can really help people but anyway i love u so much  and u mean the world to me <3
i actually really liked this matt
matt i (and by that i mean we) literally LOVE you so much. you are a fabulous human being, you are not boring at all, and just <3 :)
Matt your not boring ❤️😭😭 You yourself have helped me a lot and your TikTok’s and YouTube videos always help me ❤️❤️ love you
yay so proud matt!!!
you are not boring. otherwise you wouldn’t have such a large loving fan base. and it makes me happy that you talked about your anxiety- cause i struggle with anxiety too and it’s really nice to feel understood. i hope you had a great day. i love you <33
I watch a lot of YouTube... finding your channel is a bit of a surprise tho (YouTube algo looks like it did the ting) but I'm looking forward to your videos.
I think that is a good idea to talk about your anxiety to the public and explain who you are as a person without your brothers
I love Matt so much idk why he call himself boring but he’s not hes such an amazing person cuz I love him so much
need more of these videos ASAP. love you matt!! <33
ily
don't worry everyone who watches you likes you and thought you were funny or something (and I think so) we all love you and keep going! I can't wait for the next videos! ❤❤❤
you can tell he’s gotten so much more comfortable in front of a camera and i’m so proud of him for that cause that shit is so hard
Plzzz do pranks on ur personal channel that’d be so cool. You could also do reaction videos to tiktoks or other people’s videos about you 💕💕
thank you so much for this video and i'm really waiting for the depressing talk also ❤️
i love the little editing remarks in between. it shows personality and makes me smile each time.
❤️❤️
Me does a lot of vids to keep people happy it has took me 8 months to get 65 subscribers but him he does one video and gets over 1 k I don’t understand it’s not fair I feel upset
the end is hilarious i loved this so much
neenooneenoo
The way you saw the guy walking and locked the doors 😭😭
Matt you’re not boring whatsoever. You’re entertaining and fun. We love you with all of our hearts ♥️
bro i love u sm
do you go out do eat all day
and di you come clean
you look so clean fresh do you  keep your shoes clean
Clothing Haul+Shoe Haul
you did great ong people and me will love your content even if u just started kicking a pillow for an hour straight
This video made me laugh in so many ways all good matt you are actually really entertaining so never doubt yourself
Ahahaahah same I feel that too about rings but I'm very comfortable with one necklace that I always use
Matt I love your earrings please show them all!! And also do you have any tattoos?? If not would you like to have some? If so, what would it be like?
matt we love uuuu
Hi Matt!! I love you and you will always have a spot in my heart. I just wanna say that what you are doing it's really amazing, because believing or not a lot of people relate to you and this can be a safe place for all of us. So what you are doing it's really incredible and we all appreciate that. Don't forget that you are an awesome person too ant don't think that kind of things about you because their will always be people who love you and really appreciate the way you are bcs we all feel the same. I love all of you three your brothers and you but I always had this feeling for you and knew that you were an incredible person such as your brothers just in your unique way. Always love yourself and remember to be who you are and that is people who care about you and love you!!!
seeing matt alone and hoe vulnerable he is makes me happy in a sense that it affects everyone too, and i’m proud of him for coming on here and bringing awareness to it, i don’t think matt realises how much he impacts us in a different way than nick and chris do, we love you matty B❤️❤️
Matt you’re so relatable… You have such a chill vibe, I could watch your personal channel for hours without getting tired lol
Ily Matt
its like im on a phone call with you:D you’re actually really entertaining, you’re not boring at all💕 you’re so honest and open and I relate to you alot!
youre the coolest person ever
Late night talk with Matt Sturniolo. Goals
Videogames sounds fun, you don't have to be pewdiepie lmaoo
So sweet, te amo Matt, you are extremely interesting and enigmatic so do whatever you want here, I'll watch it and I'll pay for it if it's necessary 👺❤
this so fun
you're honestly my favorite person ever
WE LOVE YOU MATT
matt, you’re not a boring person at all. if anything, you’re the most relatable person i’ve ever watched. hearing you call yourself boring really makes me sad because you have actually helped lots of people and now have lots of fans in return(if that makes sense). you deserve all the love you get and more. i think you should make a video talking about your anxiety because i feel like its better if you get any pressure off your chest and let people know how you feel. even if you think it’s depressing and you’re fine it would be better to tell everyone what bothers you instead of keeping that feeling a secret. i love you matt, you changed me and i hope you continue to shine as bright as you do right now!❤️:)
this was so good! i really like your vibe  <33
Matt I absolutely adore you, the way you saw that man walk by & locked the door! I loved this videos & it wasn’t boring. Pls post more then once a month. I find you very entertaining. I also think u never finish your thoughts out loud bc nick & Chris always interrupt aha
first of all: you're not boring at all, you're so funny and comforting to watch secon: not all video's have to be ''funny'' i would actually love you to just sit down and tell us you're thoughts and talk about things you want to talk ab so please don't talk yourself down, you're amazing
Matt idc if ur boring. It’s fun to look at you so just know you always have my view 🫶😍
definitely like the prank idea
you are very beatifull
not fair that you kept shutting on yourself in the beginning a lot. Im so so happy you’re getting started with a personal channel and i can’t wait to support you. don’t downgrade yourself and your feelings it hurts all of your loving fans ;)
u aren't boring or bad,,   i get that it's the anxiety talking but u have loads of people who love you and just enjoy hearing u talk. i think it's a comfort thing to hear someone you watch talk... kind of feels like a conversation i guess   also music helps when i'm driving alone,, or podcasts so feel less anxious
One word,,✨SLAYY💪💪
Bro ur already at 100k
Love it♥
Do what you need to do Matthew
This video made me fall harder matt
aw i didn’t expect this but i love it! finally ur turn to speak :O
on a real note, videos of you just talking would ridiculously comforting. i absolutely love to videos of you all together are great to laugh at and enjoy, but videos of just you would be the videos i watch to calm down and feel safe after a crappy day. and that’s a wonderful thing to be able to do. remember that we’re all “boring” sometimes, so we can all just be boring together here. :))
NAH I GET THE ATTACHMENT ISSUES LMAO. my sisters and i are together alwaysss so when we’re not its like… “wtf do i do”
Good vid mate
matt ur not boring we love u sm
This chanel feels like a warm hug.
this is the most serious I have ever seen matt
Matt is such a vibe, joking around about himself, like that’s one thing that I live about him, he may be sad, or like unstable a bit, but he can still make jokes about that unstableness, or about himself, one thing that I find really sad though is him saying that he is “boring” by himself, or without his siblings/brothers/triplets, like it makes me so sad, because I feel like he hasn’t noticed that he is a really funny, cool, inspirational person, and he’s kept me here, like I hope that he one day soon notices himself. Love you Matt :) (sorry, Ik that made 0 sense at all, but hopefully somebody understood me-)
dont stress home dawg u funny as shit
matt ur a very entertaining person. and ur definitely my comfort person when i need it. I cant wait to see what ur going to do with ur channel! But matt ur not a boring person at all❤️
comfort person
LMAOOO 5’8 ON A GOOD DAY
why did I have the same experience I also played the recorder & trumpet & cello lmaoo
stop the editing is actually so funny
An idea you could try (because you can drive) is those drive through videos where you order what the person in front of you ordered or something like that (p.s. love your guy’s videos and am excited for your channel)
Matt your editing SENDS me
ilysm matt <3
EAMN I WSS BLOWING EVERYTHINJSHAJAKJAJAHDJAJAJA
Nah you are not boring, you need to keep going matt!
matt!! dont take this too seriously. whenever creators put too much pressure to be "entertaining" its ends up being the opposite. Just pick up ur camera and record. be natural. if ppl don't end up liking it - at least I will. :)
Maybe u could do a tier list of something? Or like reading people’s secrets
The scream at the end ✋😭
Hes the sweetest kid ever I swear.
matt you are so funny. i feel like i'm talking to a friend bc we have the same humor 😭😭 also pls don't change your video style!! create videos that make yourself satisfied, not others!
Lolll Matt you are my favorite triplet
slayed
I mean you could like do reactions to video games or like a room tour , react to stuff currently going on social media or smthing idk but don't call urself boring , trust me you are NOT boring❤🤴
just so you know you made my day :)
LOVE YOUUUU
Matt, i Really liked your video, keep posting pleaseeee, we love youu <33
Awesome job. Nice to see who you are.  Confidence and believe in yourself and you will be fine.
Your fine love. You’ll be fine
Will you play any pranks on your brothers on this channel?
LMFAOOO WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HIM BLOWING INTO EVERYTHING 😭😂
no because I could listen to you for hours and never be bored so yes keep going
Matt: ”I’m a boring person”  Also Matt: ”I PLAYED THE CELLO!”
ure not boring, Ure very interesting to listen to. I would love a video about ure anxiety and how you deal with it. This is going to be a safe place for people bc Matt is such a comforting person. I hope u will be more confident to be alone infront of the camera bc ure doing a great job:)!
I wish Matt realised how funny and interesting he actually is. I love the triplets videos together but I love seeing their humours individually aswell. I already know I’m going to love this channel, I agree anxiety isn’t really spoken about enough on here. I have crippling anxiety and I’m really struggling rn and Matt talking about his experiences with it make me feel a lot better and less alone🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻 Your channels going to do great Matt you ARE interesting and funny <3
matt, you impact so many people so positively. i have anxiety too and hearing you talk about it makes me feel so much better and helps me realise i’m not alone. you are not boring at ALL and it hurts to hear you doubt yourself so much because you don’t realise how much you truly help and entertain people. i love you so much and watching you really really helps me cope. <3
your hella insightful Matt! this video was real af and its dope, looking forward to more vids!❤
MATT I LOVE YOU
i love listening to you and im excited to see more from you
im so glad you’re doing this
Don't say you're boring! You're not! You're very entertaining and super comforting! <3
Pls don’t say that ur boring, if you spend a whole video talking about apple juice it would still make my day. <33
being brutally honest without sugar-coating anything, you are very far from being boring. -I could listen to you talk for hours without getting bored. ur very entertaining <3
I love you
I have a sister and only one friend, i do EVERYTHING with them and i actually understand how you feel when you're brothers aren't around  :) it's ganna be fine <3 :]
MATT AAAAA
i hope matt reads all these comments and understands he’s not boring and he’s so cool just as an individual 🤍
i love you matt :(
Matt, I agree with others that you are not boring.  You and your brothers together are funny as hell.  But, each of you are individuals too.  I'd like to hear more about your anxiety and what you do to when it hits as I also suffer from anxiety.  Keep these personal videos coming!!!
I like the clothing Haul idea,Deffo think it could be interesting if you be yourself💕
Ugh Matt?Who told you your boring.WE LYSM CMON DO BETTER💖💫💫💫😭
I love matt so much. He's honestly such a funny person and without trying. He just brings so much light and joy into this world and just truly warms my heart! So excited for him and his journey through his personal channel!
This was really fun I just sat there listening to you talking and I felt like being on a FaceTime with a friend it’s was so cool!
you shld definitely make a vid talking ab ur mental health struggles, there’s strength in vulnerability ♡
Pls do some anxiety video
Matt you are not boring at all i really enjoyed this video. hilights of my week fr❤
SLAY
I’m so excited for you & this channel. I enjoyed this sm cause I feel like i can relate to you & understand everything you feel. I listened 2 this video & was doing my own stuff, it felt really nice. Imagine you end up being having a spiritual zen journey here. ANYWAYS I’m just happy for this channel & see your growth !!
I'd love to listen to a podcast by you or all of you, really
I relate to u so much, ur literally my comfort person<3. I appreciate that u talk about anxiety it really helps a lot and it shows that I’m not alone. I genuinely love this video and I hope u make more. You’re such a sweetheart and I adore u for that
nah bro i genuinely like videos like these tbh
you're so loved, dude. it's very chill to watch you, don't ever worry about having a content with a sit down vlog. it's fine that you think you are boring because i personally love boring >-<
Great job Matt!!! I know this must have been never wrecking but you did it and that’s all we can ask for ❤. Literally love you the most!!!
awww we love you matt <3
Matt you are not boring you just dont talk that much as Chris and Nick do we all love you and you are special in your own way❤  (you are funny)
He’s so sweet. I love him so so so much.
You are so entertaning
you're loved
love you love you
I LOVE YOU MATT
I love these types of videos just talking about legit anything even if it don’t seem ‘important’ enough, it’s very chill
hi matt❤️❤️ i promise you’re not boring , i love watching you and hearing you talk about different topics
I think pranks on ur brothers would be so funny
Matthew
Nah but I actually love this.
wow
Embrace the boring, Matt. You are interesting and you don’t have to be funny or crazy. And you’re not boring btw.
you’re such a beautiful person Matt. I adore you. eternally grateful for you.  thank you for making me smile every single time I see you on  my screen you simply deserve the world please know that you’re so fuck1ng cool <3
Don’t let anyone say ur boring because ur not, everyone has their own humor and urs is amazing
fofucho
noo matt i love watching you and you're not boring at all im so excited for more vids in this channel
Do a drive with me
Dude you are funny don’t worry
I'm so happy you're doing your own youtube channel because i think your a very interesting person and kinda my comfort human !
yooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
YOU SHOULD GO TO TARGEY AND BUY THINGS THAT CHRIS AND NICK LIKE AND THINGS THAT REMIND YOU OF THEM
I fully understand how you feel. Like, im an introvert but i NEED friends/company. I like doing things alone but i prefer group activities w ppl i know. I hate talking to strangers but when i do, and somehow we click, i'll immediately think of them as my friend if that makes sense😂
matt u are incredible❤️ i love you so much❤️
FANTASTIC, SO HAPPY , GOOD LUCK WITH THIS EXPERIENCE : - )
Bro needs to know he’s absolutely perfect
I love u matt
Matt you are NOT boring, we are so happy you have a personal youtube channel ♥️♥️
Idk if its only me but i love watching people drive! So i would love to watch Matt driving around and telling us random stuff or funny stories that happen to him!!!
I'm really looking forward to this channel. I think it'll be a good growing experience for Matt, as an individual. I got super excited when he said he wants to talk about anxiety. I've always been about that kind of stuff and always talked about how it isn't really talked about. Super exited to watch these videos!
Honestly, you’ve always been my favorite. Your such a comforting person. And I promise your not boring at all! Also, I’ve had severe anxiety for years too and it helps to know I’m not alone. Love you Matt!!!!!!!!!
I wanna see video games on your channel. I think it would be really funny if you played popular games like fnaf, minecraft servers, little nightmares, among us, poppy playtime, mortal kombat or anything you want/are comfortable with.
I like the idea of clothing haul and anxiety  Also u could do
He sounds like such a chill and down to earth kind of guy😎😎
Hii
Do a video talking about your music taste/ Spotify playlist :))
We’re gonna need Clothing Hauls Matt cause your outfits are bomb
matt is underrated. I love him sm
OMG MATTY BOYYYY
Omlll ily smm
We want more anxiety videos  We love  you so much  Your amazing  Your not  boring. Your a just a lovely person  We love watch you talk
When u were trying to say video ideas I said it the same time as you cause I knew what u meant 😭😭😭
This is new
Great video! Glad we finally got to hear from Matt. Will look forward to the next video
matt❤️ we enjoy whatever content you post! you are entertaining! we love you so much❤️
i'm so proud of you matt!!  you did amazing! can't wait to see more videos on your personal acc!!
i lived my 2 older sisters my whole life so him saying that he wakes up does what nick and chris tell him to do and thats it is soo relatablee. i just appreciate him so much coz i dont feel as much of a weirdo? like everyone around me confident and shit and im just here feeling feeling like im a boring person. love u matt hope u realise what u did for me <3 looking forward to more vidss p.s. matt u arent boring coz i dont think these thousands of people would be here for a "boring" personn
I loved thissss!!!!
Love to see the dynamic between you and your brothers and now you as your own individual person. I can relate because I am also a triplet and it took me a long time to find myself (and kinda my own personality) without them always being around, but I still prefer to be with them. Also, in a way it is comforting and confirming to watch you guys share the same dynamics that me and my siblings do (hope that isn't weird) because I wouldn't change my situation for the world and I can tell how much you care for one another even if there is a lot of fighting (same here trust me). Anyways looking forward to the future of your channel!! Lots of love <3
Bro ur not boring your a therapist
The edits are actually killing me.It's like intrusive thoughts coming to life💀💀
I really love simple editing like this.. it just makes it more enjoyable and funny😊  alsoooo here's a video idea! A clothing haul !! I sometimes draw whatever you or the other boys are wearing because the designs are so cute 🥰
we love u mattyb 🫶
Ily
You're not boring but I really understand where you're coming from, because when I'm alone I feel like I'm not as interesting and funny without my group or people. I think you're so entertaining and funny, so don't doubt yourself because literally there are so many people who love you and are so excited that you've started a channel for yourself! ❤️
If it was someone else I would never hear them talking for 18 minutes BUT THIS VIDEO IS SO DAMN ENTERTAINING YOU'RE AMAZING MATTY B
the editing is so good and those funny clips are hilarious ,love your channel Matt also please talk about social anxiety
this was great matt! keep going at ur pace. excited and will forever support u 😘😘
Idk how he has already have over a 100 thousand subscribers 🤯
I am so happy for Matt he always is the less heard one and more closed up than Chris and Nick, so I am happy he can have a space to talk about his anxiety and be more expressed about it. We love you Matt keep going you deserve it.
I’m excited to see what you do matt!
Just being yourself is enough and thank you for doing that
honestly matt just needs to understand how many people love him for him and he doesn't need to be like chris or nick to be entertaining
I’d love to see you revisit the cello 🎻 do a video showing what you remember or learn to play something simple just to show us!
the intro and outro was funny please don't change it 💀
I'm definitely hoping that this channel will help you feeling comfortable alone! Really looking forward to it 🙌🏼
honestly no one will prob see this- but…  matt tbh reminds me a lot of myself. that might be why i favor him a lot(no hate to nick or chris), but he definitely does. he doubts himself often and thinks he’s “bland” by himself; however, he’s not. matt is capable of so much but it’s hard to see it in certain situations. personally, i can be very quiet around sociable friends but loud around quiet friends. matt definitely molds his energy around his environment (which love the matching energy😙). Anyways- overall, matt (if you see this) you are an amazing person with so much potential to grow on your own. i hope with this new channel you can discover so much more about yourself and find your independence. <3
hi matt!! we love u sm
HI MATTY WATTY
😂😂 our school required us to play instrument too and I played the trumpet. I also could not figure out the notes and just played the same note over and over. P.S. I’m a triplet too (not identical) two girls and a boy. I love watching your channel because the way you tree interact reminds me of my siblings and I ❤️
i really liked when you talked about your anxiety on the podcast it was super relatable i also have had anxiety since 2016
Do Nick and Chris have there own personal channels but i love you
i’ve never noticed how similar matt and nick sound, like your voices are so similar wow lol
Matt your outro for this channel is kissing the camera.. it’s just a signature move ya know? 🤣
theres no reason to doubt yourself really you are funny and and an amaizing person jus post wtv u want its rlly up to you
HI MATT 😱
As a twin I think I understand the attachment part. You are kinda forced to do things together and so you learn to depend on each other. And so it’s hard to Branch out and figure out what your life looks like beyond them.
you’re my comfort person :,) i could listen to you talk like this everyday
at the beginning when you lock the doors bc you saw someone in the rv. same
I loved the anxiety talking idea bc it’s something that should be brought up more often on social media :)
I think with Matt having his own personal channel we get to know him a lot more and also like see you different side of him!
i can just tell this video is gonna be way more quiet
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU PLAY GAMES
DAY IN THE LIFE OF MATT STURNIOLO PLSS <3
GAMING VIDEOSSSS
Matt you’re going great!!! Cant wait to see what this channel becomes
The sad fact is that just have 1 vid yet
Matt is truly amazing and I do believe that coming on here and talking about his anxiety is a great way to grow and reflect. Knowing that there’s people who can relate to him too is great ! This channel has sm potential and I look forward to seeing more of his solo content !! Also Matt definitely isn’t a bore. He’s just used to Nick and Chris paving the way with him, but he’s on the more introverted side. That’s interesting and cool though because there’s a lot to look forward to when getting to know those types of people ! 🤍❤️
Very happy to see you try to do something independently and speak without interruptions.  I subscribed and will watch whenever you post no matter how infrequently you might do so.  Speaking about your anxieties, major and minor is bound to make it easier for others to do the same.  You'll help enormously to de-stigmatize talking about mental health.  Well done, you!
matt stop you're not boring you're my favourite triplet fr dont tell chris and nick
I love this idea this was really entertaining
i love you
You are fine!!! Having anxiety is so common nowadays, and yet it’s seen as this horrible thing and you’re weird if you have it and talk about it… it’s really important for general acknowledgment and normalization of anxiety and anxiety symptoms that someone with the platform you have talks about it! Welcoming these videos with everything in me ^_^
love love loooove all those ideas for the channel!! You’re amazing Matt <333
i really think for a moment that he was going to kiss the camera kkkkk i miss that
ILY AND YOU SHOULD DO MUKBANGS
The way he peeped someone walking in the back and locked the doors😂💀
you’re doing a good job mat keep going!
matt you’ve got yourself a solid shakespearian community, have fun reading the comments bae
PLEASE im begging play valorant it would be so entertaining
I miraculously found you all by yourself so it is possible ☺️😂
you and your brothers are seriously my safe space and create content that makes people happy and at home. i know i could trust you 3 with anything and you cant find people like that anymore.
i rlly love how he got his 18 mins of time to speak with no interuptions.
When Matt talks for a while without everyone else u realise how funny he is he’s such a genuine person and he’s literally the best💗
It would help me so much if u spoke abt ur anxiety more often ilysm ❤❤❤
I actually only subscribed to your channel since you could talk here more <3 we will support you pls post more!!
he is so sweet im so many ways !! we love u matt and we are here for u . you are not boring you are the most funny sweet and amazing person i know and i havent seen u irl , so this means that u have shown yourself u are wanderfull
The editing is everything
keep it going! Just do the hauls. Talk about mental health. Find yourself away from your brothers. It doesn’t have to be so entertaining every second of the video. You can just talk about how it feels. You seem like a super chill/insightful person from the get, go with your flow
Very very grateful to be able to watch a YouTuber that I relate to on SO many levels. With the attachment issues with my brothers that I’ve actually worked on, anxiety I still struggle with, and feeling like I’m not able to have a voice when I actually have a lot to say. *Thank you so much Matt💛💛💛*
It makes me sad that Matt thinks he’s boring and not as entertaining without his brothers. The attachment issues thing is real you can be around someone so long and get so accustomed to what they do that you feel incomplete without them. I hope as he gets farther along in his YouTube journey he learns to be more confident and that he’s not boring at all to us and we love him💛. We like you for you Matt not for your persona🥹
MATT, YOU ARE NOT BORING!!!!!!!!!
i really wanna hear more of you matt!! it's so cool that you're starting your own channel and you're not boring at all, i absolutely love seeing you like this. it's just as enjoyable as the trio's videos, i promise, please don't abandon us here i love you so much
im stuck at the 15:08 "internet" god, that was so cute
The fact that he can just be looking at his phone and scroll on tiktok or sum shit for half and hour and he’d still be so fvcking entertaining lmao
ilove you
YOU SHOULD MAKE A WHOLE NEW VIDEO ABOUT YOUR ANXIETY, IF YOU´RE OK WITH THAT, CAUSE I WANT TO KNOW YOU BETTER AND I ALSO THINK I CAN RELATE .....LOVE YA <3
it breaks my heart when u say ur boring, just so you know the videos with ur brothers wouldn't be the same without you, we love you so much and ur literally the funniest person on earth, getting and individual chanel its a big step for you, and we get to learn so much more about you, even if its kinda weird at first, im pretty sure this will be amazing and we are here to support you, we are so proud off you
I glad you your gonna talk about anxiety because like you say not allot of people with platforms talk about it 🤍
I haven’t realized how I love Matt so much I can’t wait until he post more  videos for us to watch even if he had no topic im so excited!!
What about doing a video on making, painting something. Are you an artistic person?
“Damn I was blowing on everything “ 💀 13:44
this makes me feel so comfortable because i relate to most the stuff youre talking about with anxiety and stuff ❤
I'm so glad you're being so open about anxiety because it's real and it's all around and it's so important to talk about it more on social media.
AAHHH IM SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU HERE
matt u are such a comfort person ❤️‍🩹 so excited for more videos!!
LET'S GOOO!
we love a self discovery journey - also this editing is killllling me
I'm rlly looking forward to ur videos ab coping with anxiety. its nice to hear someone talk about the same things you're struggling with
WASSUP
Can you put a translation in Arabic because you have Arab followers and I do not understand much of the English language?
Please don’t say ( I’m boring ) because you’re not & I love your personality sooo much ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love your videos when you're together and i think it's great that you have started your own channel. You're one of my favorite youtubers
I relate to this man so much
he says hes boring i say " HES AMAZING" just him and his personality makes the best human being it shatters my heart when he say something like "oh i am a very boring person in general" the people who will actually watch his content on this channel likes him yknow and i love matt him being himself is all i need he makes me happier whenever i need it and this channel is like a miracle to me so even though people arent going to watch u know i will be watching
I cant wait for more matt content :))
i love the editing omgg this is so funny
matt i am loving this for you right now, you are killing it bud
this was an awesome first video!! keep up the good work Matt! You are NOT boring just because you're not with nick and chris doesn't mean you aren't entertaining us!! keep your head up and we'll be here to support you!
dunno if this helps but a lot of YouTubers feel like they’re not interesting enough when they do videos like this so they end up not posting because they think they’re boring but I personally love these sit down vids. Great start to the new channel <3
Everything Matt was saying I can relate to. Like when I’m with my friends I feel like I can be funny and interesting but when I’m alone I feel like I become boring.
WE LOVE YOU MATT!!
The memory thing is one of the best feelings like genuine happiness when I remember something i completely forgot about that someone makes me think about. Makes me want to ramble on about it forever cause i get so excited
Matt I love u You're amazing and I'm really proud of you 💗💗💗💗
I’m so glad you’re doing this because I always wanna listen to what you have to say but you get interrupted most of the time. Don’t think you’re boring because you’re really enjoyable and interesting to listen to, I love that <3
Matt need to know that he isn't boring He just dont talk that much as Chris and nick
I love u Matt 💞
im so proud of u! 🤍
ur so not boring
Matt we love you so so much. Please do what makes you happy because if your happy then ur fans/supporters are too ❤️
you're extremely entertaining and the way that you throw in stuff when you're editing is literally me all the time. I have anxiety too and I love how willing you are to be open with it (I don't think that sentence made sense). literally my comfort person, super happy you're starting some occasional content of just you
i would've been a little sad if you didn't scream into the camera for the outro thats all you need to do tbh its my favorite part of the group channel videos lol
Hey Matt! I’m a fan of yours, but as a person who was clinically diagnosed with anxiety since the age of 10. There is a difference between being nervous and having anxiety. The “pee” example you used was nervousness.
The editing cuts are killing me 💀
WE LOVE YOU MATTYYY B 😘😘😘😘
We love and support you Matt 💜
Your doing so great! I could listen to you all day your not boring❤️
Will u believe it if I say that you're the first guy who got my attention among you three cause your presence is too calming and sweet? You're sucha cutiee
I fucking love this!!  I really love you guys together but I really really really love you alone...get to know you. I feel like i hang out with a friend... I can wait to watch more.
am i the only one who wants to give me a warm hug and tell him how much he means to me
15:07 “why’d i say internet like that” 💀
You should really do pranks on Nick and Chris! Idk what kind of pranks but you’re smart🤷‍♀️
“Go pee in the sink” I’ve done it, don’t know if I suggest it
you are not boring
I LOVE THE ENDING PLS LET THIS BE YOUR OUTRO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Talk about anxiety  I have it to
You should make a video of you trying exotic foods
I like your swearing for some reason :) yea.
I relate to you a lot on this matter Mat. My twin sister is soooo outgoing by that ı mean really really outgoing and Im more of a an introvert soo. Unfortunately I have attachment issues too lol. When we were kids I would beg her to not make friends and hang out wiyh me lmao. And Im trying to get over that buy ordering my coffee alone or smth.ThAT SOUNDS SO BAD WTF LMAOO. But whatever I get you bro and I feel the same way but I like watching you even in silence lol I think you have a friendly aura :)))
100% not boring I was defs entertained watching this video and can't wait to see what he does with his videos in the future
Matt tbh you did so fuc*ing amazing i love to see how you talk so much 😍and get to know you on a different level i really hope it makes you feel good to make videos by your self and maybe you are going to be more consistent than you think. It maybe helps you with your attachment to chris and nick like some alone time is good like finding your self. Keep going i love to see it🥰
he's such a sweet soul omg. he deserves everything in the world.
definitely do monthly current Spotify playlists!!
lmao i really like the random captions its so class
wow i knew he was pretty but damn,,, he's even prettier solo
you're one of the people i admire for talking about anxiety in the realest way. it isn't always this grandeur thing, but little things that add up. it felt nice to relate to someone organically. i remember when you talked about how you got car/driving anxiety in a triplet video and i was like "yes! finally someone who understands". thank you for that. you (and ur brothers) have definitely inspired me to just be organically myself now that i've started uploading!! so excited to see what you do!!
He really isn’t boring at all, I love Matt   so much, and it really doesn’t exist someone with better personality❤️
Bro I love this account you are not even a little boring I can understand you so much with the anxiety thing and all this keep going love this video
It's weird but your really funny and stuff! Don't doubt yourself take your time! Also, pranks would be really funny! I also have a question do you edit your videos? Really love the content!
pls dont worry we get u and i swear i relate to almost everything u've said. dont worry too much about us not understanding u because i swear we do :) at least ik a lot of us do.. ik its just the beginning so i hope it gets better for u with time, and u'll get to enjoy it more and talk freely :))
you are perfect matthew sturniolo!!!!!!! i struggle with anxiety a lot aswell and watching this video made my day because not only did i realise that im not alone but i also realised that you never know what is going on behind closed doors, especially with people who put themselves in the public eye. you put yourself out there and you go for it and that is what i really love about you. you dont suck, u dont sound stupid, its ok if you go off topic it makes your content realistic (its my fave part), you dont need to doubt yourself. yes there will be haters along the way, but us fans will always be here for you. you are amazing, keep doing what your doing, focus on the positive things, we all love you so much, you are amazing <3 <3  from sienna xxx
Good job with your first video Matt! Maybe, since you have the car, you can go to different fast food places and try new foods that YOU wanna try. Just an idea. Or maybe you can do prank videos and prank your brothers. That'd be hilarious!!!
Thank you so much for talking about anxiety. I get anxiety about "little things" too and no one I know gets it so listening to you talk about it is comforting :)
Matt, I have to say that I love seeing all three of you together as the brotherly love is so evident and beautiful.  But you need to know that you are also beautiful all by yourself.
yes please make vid about anxiety and just share ur thoughts.. love u sm and u're not boring at all<3
YAYY HE IS SCREAMING INTO THE CAMERA AGAIN SHUDJBJAG
But this is good just getting to know you but then it’s good that you’re vlogging and you are not alone you have all of us we are all rooting for you✨
i can see your channel turning to a comfort emma chamberlain like channel and im here for it
You're amazing and so many people look up to u but it doesn't mean that you have to change yourself for us we look up to you because you are who you are and we appreciate you alottt and we all love you and your personality <33
Okay okay ik I'm a bit late but I just want to say that you are not boring okay. Matthew Bernard Sturniolo you are the most enjoyable person on the internet ik okay so stop  doubting yourself cause we all know that you're gong to do great on this channel. Don't forget we are all here to help you okay. Luv youuuu 💞
Love you Matt!!!!!!!!
You could do a video about your favorite music in the car
YOU WERE BLOWING EVERYTHING LMAOO
It’s giving nick edited this video 🤣🤣 why you roasting yourself I was laughing this whole time you are entertaining don’t worry ❤️
hi what games do u play
You’re not boring at all, I think it’s so nice to be able to get to know you guys all over throughout these channels and the fact u get to talk about your anxiety I think it would help so many of us <3 :)
This was so entertaining, I hope you’re comfortable with posting more ❤❤
this was the chaotic, funny most random video i’ve seen in a while and i enjoyed every second of it
i love just listening to you talk its so comforting
bruh I literally started crying when Matt said he's gonna mostly talk about his anxiety.
A drive with me- favorite music would be a good vid
also, i audibly laughed several times throughout this video. you are far from boring mr matt
i love you matt, you're a wonderful human being and it's lovely to see you on your own. you're engaging and incredibly sweet, it feels like facetime :) you're a breath of fresh air on your own, and it takes a lot of strength to be so open about anxiety. always a joy to hear from u sweet matt 🫶
I’ve wanted to do YouTube for the longest time but I’ve had anxiety pretty much my whole life, and I’ve always felt like I wouldn’t be entertaining enough. So I can really appreciate you making a personal channel, even though it probably feels weird to film alone rn I promise you’re doing great💛
We should call these matts internet thearpy or something because it just makes sense
As a person with terrible anxiety and we have similar symptoms that would be great. Especially ways to cope and tips.
i love you
Oh and you guys have to do a ghost hunting series it would be so good
I get the same thing with my sister I literally don’t feel like myself when I’m not with her
Oh my gosh I needed this in my life :) I love that Matt made his own channel, I like listening to HIM talk, plus the fact that he will be talking about anxiety makes me happy and not feel crazy bc I’m sure a lot of us struggle with anxiety. Please trying posting twice a month I would love to get to know you individually as a person:) you got this Matt <3
Great start Matt 👍🏻 I agree with everything you said especially about uploading videos and vlogs and all that because this channel is about you..we want more Matt, good luck🍀
Matt is the most relatable triplet ❤️
I cant wait to see what your next vedieo is about 😁
Heyyy matt😁
In your description you used “were” I know you meant “where” we all have our moments matty boy
It actually hurts my heart when he says hes boring. I love you Matt, you are an amazing human, and watching these kinds of sit and talk videos really makes my day. As I myself also deal with anxiety and it's great to know there's someone else on the internet who I can relate too. ❤
I support you on what you wanna do on this channel!!do whatever that makes you comfortable and happy.i have social anxiety and heavy anxiety,don't worry love you as a friend not weird!!your a 🐐 at everything
THE WAY YOU SAY REESES STOP
i resonate a lot with u in different ways, and u bring me a lot of comfort. and u bring so many others comfort as well. :) i look forward to seein another vid soon enough (and seriously, take ur time with the uploading and stuff. life is a lot.) u got this :D
music and jewelry sound sick asf for vids. :))))
lmao the little text commentaries were so entertaining n made me laugh
Mukbangs or wtv they're called. Like u should try different restaurants and rate them then do like q+a or rant or something 🙃
tmatt!!!!!!!!!!!  i love hearing whatcha gotta say all the time :) i cannot wait to watch you blossom even more as an individual. i cherish u :,) seriously u r an angel. im more than excited to freakin watch all ur videos and learn more about ya as a human :) thats always rad :)) plus u are an incredible human overall and ur face alone brings me comfort, so that makes this EVEN MORE RAD!!!!!!!!!! <3
i could listen to him talk for hours
can we take a moment to appreciate how perfect his editing style is
you are my comfort character if that makes sense. out of the 3 of you idunno I just resonate more with your vibe and you're definitely not boring! You're very chill and cozy. you and your siblings all have very distinct personalities and we connect with each for a different reason but just watching this video of you on your own it feels right, like you need your own little corner of YouTube for us who vibe with your personality. You'll definitely be surprised to see how many of us viewers will actually love your videos (even if they aren't frequent lol) but there's definitely many of us out there tailored to your type of person and wtvr connect you decide to release :) I hope you feel confident and comfortable on your own as you do on the triplets channel.
here's an amazing video by jared padalecki on Anxiety:  https://youtu.be/D0n2lSv5oF4  fyi, jared is a really handsome and kind actor. he has a show called Walker on the CW every thursday at 8pm. He's super kind and dealth with depression, suicidal thoughts and anxiety etc etc. Here is a podcast about him talking about mental health if anyones intersted.    https://youtu.be/L1vfSUByGw4
i would love to see u talk about your academic interests. what courses you took in highschool, what would u study in college etc. if you read books talk about books. Or movies you watched or tv shows. also, dont ever talk about politics on here, you'll lose followers because opinions are like assholes, everyone has one but no one wants to see yours (quote by jared padalecki). talk about psychology and mental health etc etc. you seem like an insightful person so maybe you can do this thing where you look up a quote and talk about it and dig into it. that way, youll realize and learn alot of things and we will too. and that kinda thing makes ppl excited for "a new quote or poem" or wtvr. so yea just some brain storming
anxiety vid would be great! love that
UR EDITING IS KILLIGN ME LMAOOO
i love how open you were with the different levels of anxiety. because it isn’t always life or death, it can be small things and it’s still anxiety that affects how you think. that felt important to someone who has anxiety about small things.  honestly i think you’ll do just fine on your own— you’re so comforting and open about the small things that a lot of people struggle with. i’m so excited to see how you’ll grow and i’m hoping for the best for you <3
I know his Youtube Channel  is gonna be my new comfort channel
i love u matt
matt ur my favorite person ever
ur so cute i love you
It sucks that Matt doesn’t know how amazing he is.
ur so comforting, I just want to give you a hug.  AND THE EDITING I LOVE IT SM  KEEP GOING MATT. ur amazing. I’m excited for the new vids & to relate to them. ❤️🤍
This video made my day! Believe in yourself more!
Hey Matt, I have very bad anxiety too, and stop doubting yourself you are amazing and loved ❤️
you are not boring love, u have interesting thought and things to say, dont treat yourself like that
Ur definitely not boring, different people  have their own ways of entertaining people. I’m glad that u and ur brothers have decided to create personal channels so we can all see just how u are alone and not with each other.
PLS KISS THE CANERA AT THE END WE MISS THAT
makes total sense Matt, that happens to me so much times its a really great feeling
2:15 matt talking about his anxiety just breaks my heart 😭🥺
THE WAY THE CAMERA FOGGED UP AT THE THE END WITH HIS LITTLE BIRD CALL OR WHATEVER 😭😭
Matt’s just the cutest
all the introverts in the world need to know that they're not boring they're just calm and as interesting as extroverts:))
this video actually made me love you so much more. and u handled it so well oml!!!! like it wasnt awkward at all and was so entertaining!!! so excited for more of these. i love you so much❤️❤️
MATT YOU ARE SO HARD ON YOURSELF STOP IT RN.
i feel like he doubts himself so much and i hope this channel and these comments show him how much we love him for himself and not just being apart of the trio i also hope he ends up growing here and realizing that no matter what he posts we love the content because we love him
Love the little texts of you responding to yourself😂❤️👍👍 And start to really believe in yourself Matt!!🧸🥺
matt is literally the cutest human being.  idk he just seems so innocent and pure hearted yk like an actual genuine person. also i hate how he keeps lowkey putting himself down and saying stuff “im kinda boring” “not interesting”. like boy we love you. GIVE YOURSELF SOME CREDIT<3
i genuinely think making this channel was a great thing. the things about anxiety resonate so much with me, and your channel is starting to feel like it can be a safe space. you're not boring, I promise. just because you're not talking all of the time doesn't mean you haven't got some great things in your head, or you are boring. even though I don't know you personally, just from watching videos I can tell you're kind, and funny, and have a big heart. i can't wait for more videos, you're the coolest matt
I did cello for a couple of months in fourth grade and then quit bc of social anxiety and also not wanting to bring the cello on the bus bc of being anxious about everyone looking at me
The scream at the end of the video has to stay it was so funny omg
I love that he made a channel. He’s the quietest triplet during the videos but we all value what he says so much. I’m so excited!
PLEASE DO A STORY TIME ON THE PANARA GIRL🙏🙏🙏
Matt, we love you so so much ok? You impact so many people… I love you. Keep doing what you’re doing <3
Maybe you can do fashion vids like when you go thrifting (if you do) because i always think that youre fits are fire!!!
shush matty B pickle juice is heaven
I really love the Anxiety idea, I’ve been struggling with Anxiety for the last five years and I really feel like I have no one to talk to about it, I really have no idea how to deal with it and I think hearing your experiences and outlook on it could be very helpful.
First off, when he said baby, the comfort was real guys!! Also imagine if he started kissing the camera goodbye again as an outro? Let me tell you, if that happened I would 100% believe in like god or smth🤷🏻‍♀️
oh my god im so exited for the anxiety talks bc i relate to u sm omg. i literally love that this can be a safe space, plus ily matt so im super exited!! YAY
MATT PLZ IF U SEE THIS PLS BRING BACK KISSING THE CAMERA FOR AN OUTROOOOOO 💓😭
I already know this is gonna be such a safe place for people. Matt is such a comforting person and I think him opening up about his anxiety etc really helps a lot of people feel as though they are not alone. Ive never met Matt but it feels like he's there for all of us. Lots of love <3
off topic but his eyes are so beautiful.omg
I wish he could see himself the way we do
istg my heart breaks when matt calls himself boring :(
Matt you're absolutely not boring. I enjoyed your video so much, I deal with rough anxiety and your video made me feel so much better and happier. I literally have tears in my eyes because you probably don't even know I exist and you saved my life. Totally. If i have to be honest, you're the one person I still fight with my depression for. You're amazing person and have a great personality, don't even question that. I wish one day I could hug you and tell you how grateful I'm you exist. You have such a pure heart ❤️ i love you, i'm so proud of you and can't wait for next videos to just make my day better. PROUD OF YOU! I LOVE YOU, YOU'RE MY INSPIRATION 🖤 you're not boring!!!! you're actually super interesting person and I'd love to know you better. Hope I do. Love u, u did such a great job. 🤍
"subscribe baby"'
this video is now my safe place ngl
Hey, I just needed some talk. I didn't know any other place so I came to watch your video. The way you calmly speak has become my comfort. I hope it's also okay that I share my story here. Anyways I had a hard day tbh and I don't know what to feel. I just wish people could choose their words carefully so that nobody would get hurt. I really heard a lot of bad words today but I know it will pass too. Anyways thanks for being here.
Matt ur not boring ur the best love you so much >3
something about the way he talks and explains things really connects w me cuz i’m the same way (like the way he loses track of what he’s saying, the codependency on his brothers, etc.) and there’s a sense of comfort that he conveys in his videos that make it easy to follow along and relate to. these r the types of videos you’d catch me watching while doing everyday tasks (cleaning, eating, etc.) cuz, like i said, there’s that level of comfort and safety that he brings. i love him.
“i dont have nick interupting me and chris yelling at me” “im not entertaining” im crying sm. it hurts my heart sm when he says these things because he really insnt boring to me hes super entertaining and relatable. i love matt sm. this video made me cry smile laugh literally every emotion 😭.
Ur doing great sweetheart🤍🤍…Ur not boring and it was a very enjoyable and entertaining video…💙☁️looking forward to more of your content💙💙
🦋
you're not boring matt!

the end killed me 😭love how the camera fogged up that should 100% be the outro
First video 120 k subrscibe
Yes please make more vids. Your doing great😁👍.
how does this have so many views
I love how he just deals with everyone that’s negative on him.Like he deserves more.Even nick and Chris they deserve more than this.I love them and we should show more support.They work so hard for us to upload vids for us as well and I’m very appreciated❤️❤️
you’re such a lovely and wonderful person. i could literally listen to you talk for hours. you genuinely deserve the world<3
this man was spending half this video trying to convince us that he’s okay😭 i promise king we know haha
My anxiety has been horrible since 2026 too. I haven’t been able to go out with friends, I can’t spend to much time away from my mom and siblings, and I constantly think other people are judging me. Your channel is already a safe place for me 🤍
You sound kinda like you have adhd thats probably why you dont remember things without people bringin them up. Felt good someone feels and thinks just like me thank u
What the fudge is this and who is him
matt my darling you’re not boring you’re such a kind hearted person who makes us all feel safe we love your so much<333
U inspire me a lot and i´m so glad that u talk about ur anxiety cause it really helps me. Ur not boring and take ur time to upload the next vid :))
Why is this on my reccomended idek who this is
MATT I LITERALLY LOVE U. URE SO RELATABLE AND FUNNY!! PLS REALIZE THAT U ARE NOT IN ANY WAY BORING!!!!
LOVE THIS VIDEO MATT KEEP GOING 👌🏻👌🏻❤️❤️
Idk how you made it to my feed, but that many views in 2 days , you’ll probably be one of those internet sensations
I FOUND THE TRIPLETS “ Chubby bunny challenge” https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vVEHGnjCqB0  🤣🤣🤣
In my opinion its really cool that you're doing your own videos now bcs talking about anxiety and just the way you think or feel in certain situations can help a lot of people bcs they can relate to you if that makes sense. So keep it up - its nice listening to you !
with an intro like this, it needs to be your LAST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'll find it not boring at all to see you react to animal rescues or stuff like that : https://youtu.be/yTOHV09Mfgs (have no idea if you like animals but i like them)
This is full on Matt content and I'm in LOVE!!!! Keep up the good work, love you and your brother's too 🥰
Hi
Matt, you are amazing. I love every part of you and you should too. hearing you talk is calming, in a way. yes you have anxiety, i do too but that should never define your personality, cause I know that even through a screen you are much more then that. You are not boring, you are not depressing and you are definitely not an idiot x
well i can tell i'm far too old to watch this kind of stuff. . . all i saw was some random teen chatting at himself as if we're all his friends, in 10 years he's going to be just as alone and aimless as now if this is all he cares about ....sad...what are you actually going to FEED yourself after mom stops making your cereal?  i hope he marries a rich man so he can keep being the typical housewife....shrug
bless himm

You could use your channel as your personal "diary" if that makes sense. For example you could have a journal in your every day life and write down things you struggle with, or like, or wish to speak up about, and at the end of the month you do a whole recap of cool topics :) I hope this helps as an idea! Btw i loved this video!
I think making videos talking about anxiety would be really helpful I recently found out I have anxiety and it’s not really talked about on social media and I really relate to you in videos and you make me feel less awkward and insecure about having anxiety and not talking as much as some of my friends and I don’t know this was me rambling on that you’ll probably never see but yeah if you do thank you so much for openly talking about your anxiety it’s helped me more than you’ll ever know🤍🤍
I love chill videos like these, I recommend an anxiety series like 2 episodes a month.. each one has a theme but the overall topic is anxiety  Like for example episode one is realizing you had anxiety and the symptoms and how to ask for help, ep 2 can be about overcoming it or making easy etc etc I feel like it woulf be really helpful
video games would be so fun. you playing with people just getting hype or chris and nick watching you would be so fun. it would be so different too
Ok hello mister Matt TRENDING PAGE Sturniolo omg
most relatable person i love so comforting
Repent to Jesus Christ  ““Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God ; believe also in me.” ‭‭John‬ ‭14:1‬ ‭NIV‬‬ h
SLAYJORRR
I honestly just want to see him work through different scenarios (drive thru's, shopping, etc) by himself and i also would love to see him take up a hobby like reading or sum like that. i'm just excited to see him grow as a person. i just love him, he's the best triplet all around tbh :)
If you confess Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart the Father raised Him from the dead you will be saved. Romans 10:9
prolly my fave outro 😎👊😂
Nahh cuz matt is such a comforting person I could listen to him talk forever  He's so fun I'm being serious. I love him sm.
idk everything he said made perfect sense to me. i love this so much, i feel like i’m really getting to know him with this channel, whereas on their joined channels we don’t really hear him a lot.
We love youu Matt!! the video is amazing we would love to see videos like this more , you don't have to do something entertaining you just talk about whatever you want and we will absolutely love it plus i was waiting for the shout at the end 😭😭😭😭
also you know something I don’t understand! I don’t know how on gods green earth no-one spoke about Matt saying “subscribe baby, that’d be cool” like… bless you are actual soul Matt!! Keep doing what you are doing love you so much💗✨
I for no reason want u to make a video of you playing tower of hell and just screaming cus u fell
i think you are the complete opposite of boring. u are so entertaining and i love your personality im so exited for more videos in the future and i cant wait to get to know you better. i love you so much matt!!!!. listening to you talk about life and expressing your feelings is so comforting, dont doubt yourself you are so amazing and im so proud of you for stepping out of your comfort zone and starting your own channel. i am a twin and i understand how you feel, i hardly do anything without my twin sister and its hard to try and do things alone but you inspire me to also step out my comfort zone and find myself and to be honest you and your brothers really make me wanna do youtube but im scared to.
Omg i don’t know why I got so excited over this part in particular but your dads name is jimmy!!! My dads name is Jim ahaha how random and stupid of me but yeah that’s cool haha 😊 xx
IM SO SORRY I WAS WATCHINF THE VIDEO AND CLICKED AT THW BOTTLM AT THW SAMW TIME
I loved thiss!! I smiled the entire video cause I kept relating to literally everything you said, plus the editing was so funny🤩
you're doing so good matt :)
Is this a trans lady?
This made my day 100x better  I <3 matt
Such a cool person. I enjoyed this video Matt and I am glad that you are willing to post videos about anxiety cu I suffer from that as well like critically.
Matt,  it's okay to be uncertain and have doubts this is your 1st video. here we all love and support you and it is incredible how you can be so genuine with your viewers because that is what people want to see! you do not have to be hard on yourself, you are going to do amazing things on this channel and the most important thing is that YOU have fun doing it! I am genuinely excited about all of the awesome and unique content on this channel!
I’m really appreciating your effort 🥺🥺🥺🥺
No dip Sherlock
Your editing is good too
Matt i love your content
matt is gonna be the channel that I watch when I need comfort, nick's when I want to laugh and chris' when I feel lonely and I need a friend idk why but that makes so much sense to me. oh and I'll get all of that when I watch their main channel :)
ayyyeee you’re on the trending page matt!!
hey matt, i know you might not see this, but i just want to let you know im so happy you started your own channel. im so happy your going to be talking about anxiety, because to be honest my anxiety has been pretty bad lately and its really been taking a toll on me, and a lot of the time i dont really feel  like i have a safe space to talk about it. please dont doubt yourself because you are doing an AWESOME job. and it was super entertaining to watch this. ur the sweetest most comforting person and i just wanted to say thank you for everything you do! have a good day, dont forget to smile :)
I’ve never relate to anyone more than I relate to Matt!💕
Matt I can’t express how proud of you I am! I truly get distracted a lot while watching things but this is the thing that doesn’t distract me I’ll sit down and listen to this everyday if I could. I so fucking proud of you and love you sm!
matt you gotta kiss the camera for your outro….
If that makes sense, even tho you live together theres probably a lot of things you dont do together, im the one who just happen to fall here cuz youre in the page of YouTube, you probably not boring you just arent used to being alone, the talk videos could be done while you drive so you can talk your anxiety out, should get a doctor bro, maybe hair videos? I like your hair, how you cut it and stuff, dont feel forced to be entertaining, ppl dont realize they are like this normally, you should start journaling, should get back to music if you were kinda good at it, helps anxiety
when matt’s #42 trending wooooo
You are very entertaining and calming, I can really relate to you.
LOVE U MATT!!🫶🫶💪💪🤍🤍
I’m a triplet🥳
this is off topic but please switch back to your old hair I think It looks better
Congratulations on 100k + on your first video!
Heyy Matt, i'm fucking proud of you!!
IT'S TRENDINGGG
it's so funny to me that chris and nick decided to do their own channel before but matt posted a video before them
You should do some videos of you driving around 🙃
excited to see more content on this channel!! but not gonna be disappointed in you if you don’t get to it. don’t worry abt it seriously. but i loved this video and i love getting to know you bc i think i relate to you on a lot of aspects. love you matt <33
Dont change. Dont change the videos. You have an amazing personality. You arent boring. I live for these videos!!!!!
Who is this guy
Great
OK BUT WHO AGREES THAT MATT SHOULD DO A VID WHERE LIKR HIS FRIENDS CHOOSE HIS OUTFITS FOR A WEEK AND A WARDROBE TOUR
I think you should talk about like what accasions you usually get anxiety, what helps with it and what are your symptoms. And I would love if you would make q&a vids and stuff like that!
i relate to him a lot, i feel like we have so much in common when it comes to anxiety and mental health issues, honestly it makes me think that im not alone and someone really understand me.
18:20 the scream sounds like a great outro to me👍
yaeeee go matt💪💪💪
Chris,Nick and I, so that I'm into something intel,  youth, our gems, not smart or fast but intel, caution on first impressions, and, hi,anxiety and young ,can't be more normal ,happy launching
take us out for a drive every now and then hahaha, that could be fun
Who is this and why he's so handsome?
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.   We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him.  We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself by being Crucified and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins.   He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.  May God Bless you all! ♥️
you could just do this kind of videos where you talk about one or various subjjects as it it was a podcast👍
I loved how he said that nick and Chris weren’t there to interrupt him, then proceeded to interrupt himself with the pink screens that he edited in🤨
i love you
The guy pass in the back was so scary
Matt I love you so much. You are so comforting to me and so many other people and we all love you so much
Someone sold out to Satan
i really love you three but i can say with all my heart that i relate much more with you and a i am so happy that you did a chanel and transform it into a safe place for all of us! thank u love u! 🇧🇷 🫶🥹
matt to start off i wanna tell u how proud i am of you and how proud. I feel like your youtube channel is gonna be such a safe place for so many people and thats so amazing!  So many people are thankful for you and have ur back!
i’m so late but Matt keep writing. you let yourself down so much. WE LOVE YOU. I promise even if you talk about a carrot for 10 minutes we’ll be entertained 🫶🏼
You look like someone who would play cello and i mean that in a good way
Jupp i get the ring thing alot. It can trigger my anxiety cus i feel trapped when they don't sit right
So excited for the videos to come! you've got this, proud of you for doing this and stepping out of your comfort zone and doing it alone. All the love and keep up the good work!!
this was so funny i cant
you should definitely keep this going, i love how your talking like we’re on facetime.
I honestly like watching people play video games even though I don’t play them. I think it’s something different for you to do since you do know of much you can do independently. If you enjoy that and think we would enjoy it there’s no harm in trying.
🤯🤯🤯
I Love these videos
Authenticity will always sale. Take it from me. It doesn't matter if your talking about 2 giraffes play with playdough and watching porn. Just be honest and authentic! 💯❤️
You are the best

You are not boring!! WE LOVE YOU MATT <3
Really enjoyed this video but a clothing haul would be such a cool thing and I would really be excited if you upload one of these too. But pleasee also do talk vids like this one <3
Matt I really have the urge to tell you that your content is top tier and I am really excited for every single one of your videos <3  And I wanted to say: if you feel like pressure to upload or that you get compared with Nick and Chris you should really know that you do you and don't care too much about negative opinions. There are so many people who love you just like you are. So much love from meee :)
Genuinely Matt is my favourite because no matter what you can be funny or supportive or entertaining and it makes me laugh so much! You deserve everything you want because your genuinely the best person ever <333
ratio gtfo my home page bozo
You did great!  Relax. You're off & running now. The Greatest journey begins w/a single step 😃 you conquered that.  🙏🙏❤️  Stop swearing so much. swearing isn't a problem. Overdoing it is. 😕😌
BRO I HATE THAT HE DOUBTS HIMSELF I LITERALLY LOVE HIM SO MUCH BRO OMG
Its so sad that he thinks hes boring, hes actually really interesting and funny and comforting and i know i will loveee this new channel!
You need JESUS CHRIST. HE says "call unto me and I will answer you and show you great and mighty things you know not of" HE is the truth and in HIM is no lie. Do it. Why cheat yourself? Then you will know HE is real HE is alive HE is all powerful.
the locking of doors after seeing someone at 2:02 is me lmao
His channel will be such a comforting place for everyone with anxiety (including myself) because he is such a comforting person and it's just so soothing to hear him talk and it makes me feel just super safe and comfortable and him talking about his anxiety makes me feel a lot less alone :) I love you Matt
the fact u said sunrises says a lot about you and just made me like u even mooore
the clipes with a note are so random, its soooo funny
Soooooo handsome (;❤️🥹
def do more of these! we love them:)))
please do talk about anxiety
the elevator music every 5 minutes😭
Why even bother having a personal channel if your not really going to post anything?
OUTRO IDEA: i think that a lot of people wish u would bring back the outro kisses❤️‍🩹(ofc only if u feel comfortable)
go matt ure dng amazing
Who the hell are you
Just an idea i think youll  do amazing telling stories touching on different types, kinds and time on youve had anxiety and how you got passed it or what helped. Also just stories from your childhood!!
To whoever is reading this : May God bless you ! You’re gunna do great in life  ! Put God first and everything will fall into place ! John 3:16 says , “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life ! Wishing nothing but love , joy , peace, prosperity, faith, hope, etc. Have a blessed day ! God loves you so much!!!!!
i love you matt <33
you're not boring at all my love. you're so smart, kind, sweet, funny, and entertaining.
tbh matt i could listen to u rant abt random ass shit all day long i promise ur not boring bro
you have no idea how much you've helped me with my anxiety, and just in general. you're really special matt, i hope you know that
omg i used to play the cello too, but then i realised i dreaded every lesson so i quit haha. also, loved this video, you're definitely not boring this was great to watch
i love matt so much omg STOP DOUBTING YOURSELF you’re amazing and we all love YOU
14:17 I got that, its just the best
👕👕👕👕👕👕
, I have anxiety To
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
I feel like i am home <3
LMAOO THE RECORDER & TRUMPET PART THO
matt this is amazing. i would love to listen to you talking about anxiety and more stuff. Cant wait for more videos, take your time for everything🫶🫶
I am sure you will figure out what suits you in terms of content and I'm definitely sure there are many subscribers here who also love to sit down and listen to you talk and express your feelings! I also have alot of anxiety so having a community that can relate is very great.
Every single thing Matt said was so relatable. I can never put it into words on these kind of topics of how I’m feeling but Matt described exactly how I feel. I’m excited for these videos, Matt is so great and so funny omg , the elevator music had me rollin 😭
THE WAY THE CAMERA GOT FOGGY AT THE END💀
i honestly do not care what content you post, i like you as a person so i will watch whatever you post buddy boy :P
I loved this video it was just so safe and I can relate to it because I have anxiety. SO please definitely make more videos x
matt i promise u ur an interesting person, the way u talk is very engaging and honestly its rlly easy to sit and listen to u without getting bored or anything bc of how much u connect and relate to ur fans including me, i love u so much pls dont stop this if its something u wanna do bc i promise u we will be sad without u!
one Year later still no vid uploaded…
it's weird now that matt won't be interrupted by chris
I LOVE THIS VIDEO
i absolutely loved this video
¿¿¡¡What the fuck is going on?!!
"this is really bad" hush you are doing great Matt, I can't wait to see what you do on your channel and talking about anxiety is just brilliant because I feel there isn't enough about it on media were it's something that a lot of people have.   I think you are amazing Matt, you aren't boring honestly you are very interesting. I can understand feeling different without your brother's as you are with them a lot, your triplets so feeling strange without them is perfectly normal.   I'm just excited to see what you do and that you enjoy what you come out with. Don't mind when a video comes out just interested in what you do.   Good luck and always supporting you
no matt that's not fair u constantly talk bad abt yourself thinking all the negative things but that isn't true at all. humans aren't perfect, so we don't need to please everyone >>>>>if we don't please ourselves<<<<I love your guy's personality and attitude in the videos. but yours is different I love that you are not afraid to talk abt your anxiety and it makes me feel safe and calm and you also make it interesting bc you are an interesting person. U need to be more confident abt yourself matt, trust yourself don't keep thinking that everything you do is bad, positive thoughts remember we love you matt!
the editing is good matt
the editing is good matt
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus <3
matt being our unreachable boyfriend >:(
The outro was perfect lmao. Just yell at the screen 😭
I feel like this acc is a rly good place to help us get away from this world and calms us down in so many diff ways, i love this video❤️🖤
Kinda slay

triplet becomes aware of his individuality for 18 minutes straight LOLLL
you should talk about your favourite tv shows/ movies!

i could watch matt talk about literally anything, i’m so excited for future videos xx
the pink screen is what makes the video entertaining😭

i love u
Your next video should be you talking about your anxiety because I have really bad anxiety so I love hearing people talk about their experiences and how they cope with it. Love you and this was a good video! <33
You know even if u don’t think it we all find u entertaining and you nick and Chris all bring something different which we all love !This is ur first vid by itself don’t put to much pressure on ur self just know we’ll love tuning in once every month to watch ur channel.
Matt you have no idea how many people can now relate to this new content and finally see that whatever they feel, it is normal and valid. I think this is going to be a great opportunity for u to grow and develop your character, and personally im thrilled to see where this leads. Great video btw<3!!
dont worry matt you dont sound like an idiot we understand you
<3
youre my safe space tbh
i could listen to you talk all day
Dude don't make anything else please you're so lame it hurts
In love with this vid, can't wait for the next one!
This video was really good don't worry Matt u really do doubt urself a lot ...it's okay I know U'll get better...plus ur really relatable
So proud of you Matt, please never doubt yourself. You’re doing amazing keep going. Love you so much, thanks for helping me with my anxiety❤️
i was waiting for a kiss at the end of the video ngl
Matt don’t stress about the videos take your time we will understand x and your not boring! You are very funny and kind! And that’s what I love about you! And thanks for talking about anxiety I deal with it aswell! And someone taking to me about it like you helps alot I hope you see this 🌸
Matt I really hope you see this, your are a amazing person telling me it’s ok to have anxiety I’m just like you I am very attached to my sister I feel like I can’t really talk if she’s not around if that makes sense. You have inspired me so much and don’t listen what other ppl say you are a very funny person and you have a amazing heart!  And you a very caring for your brothers and they bet your a amazing person! Love ya 🌸
aw he’s so cuteee 😭😭🤍🤍
Hi Matt, I love this video I can't wait for you to publish another one, and the way you talk I don't know is very relaxing.  and regarding anxiety, I too suffer from it a lot, and I'd like to hear what other people feel when they have it, so as not to feel completely strange.  I love you very much❤️❤️❤️
Lipstick? Unicorn much?
WE LOVE THIS VIDEO SM
you're definetly underselling yourself, personally i find that your comforting energy makes you stand out. Like you feel like someone I'd be able to talk to and not feel judged which might not sound like a lot to you but to someone like me thats a HELL of a lot.
loved the video <3
ATTACHEMNT ISSUES IS SO FUNYN THE EDITING HAHAH
i love this video
hi matt
Matt you need too make your own videos their gonna be so fun and amazing! I love you ur entertaining and fun I loved this video and I'd love too see more videos your not boring
matts so fcking funny unintentionally, i cant wait to see more yt videos. <3
The second you said anxiety talk I started sobbing because I feel relieved that you make me feel so comfortable when talking about it
"your peoples video ideas"
Matt I love this
Ngl loved this video
The editing killed me broo 💀💀
Ayyy, we got the same sweater
This is gonna be my safe place I already know it
Fell in love with him even deeper during this video. Hearing him talk just makes me smile.<3
Matt ur not boring sh
I feel like Matt is literally my comfort person at this point.
i can already tell i’m going to love and find a crazy amount of comfort in matts personal videos, i look forward to more videos on this channel 🫶🏻. matt is 100% my comfort youtuber, i’ve never related to anyone more! don’t doubt yourself or what you’re capable of matt, you’re going to do amazing with this personal channel and we can’t wait to discover more about you as an individual
ur not boring at all ilysm <3
When Matt said he was going to do anxiety talks I got happy because I get REALLY bad anxiety and it made me feel a lot better to know that my favorite person knows what it's like<3 ( also just btw I'm not saying it's a good thing!)
Unpopular opinion but I feel like imma like their individual videos more than the combined ones (I love both don't worry💀) but like matt said we need to get to know them separate than just being "the triplets" like seeing them together in a car just gets repetitive at a certain point but these will feel way more personal and special cause we can learn more about them and it kinda feels like we can hang out w the 3 of them individually
Trending????!
I’m living for this Matt content, I could listen to you speak all day, it’s cute but sad how he thinks he’s boring but omg I just want to hug him.
I actually enjoyed this very much. Would love more videos from you Matt! ❤️
I Respect Everyone Who Were Involved in this Seriously The best piece That I've ever seen on YouTube hats off to well all !! Your video 🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣
make this your last video. this shit cringe lmao
Just finished the video and I wanted to say that I loved this video. Also, remember that you're enough! It might not feel like it, but I promise the content you give us is enough and we'll always love it!!
Matt you can do it you got 52k followers in one day, you really need to believe you can do this.
I swear we’re the same person bc I’ll start talking with ONE topic in mind and end up going on a tangent about 10x more than I thought I could
18:20 *That puppy/dolphin noise you made, should be the official outro*
I'm so proud of your growth Matt. Thank you for being open about your anxiety, you really do provide comfort to many including myself. Keep doing you because we love you for who you are; you're naturally entertaining. :) Whatever content you put out is automatically good if you're simply enjoying what you're making. Can't wait to see how far you take this channel. <33
You should react to edits of you! Also love ya <33
*The text saying "DAMN I WAS BLOWING EVERYTHING" made me cackle*
ngl this video was a vibe. I would watch this over and over.
Ah did anyone else found this video through the explore page? 🤔
I could hear Matt’s voice for ever & not get tired of it, this man is amazing honestly he makes me so comfortable with my anxiety etc, he makes me smile sm I appreciate u Matt ly <3
Stop cussing and using Lord's name in vain... read the commandments, Bible, get close to God, apologize for sins ... repent is biblical faith in Lord Yeshua (Jesus)  Peace bro
I find you so calming to listen to because you're so real. I relate to so much of what you say and it is so comforting. It's so easy to forget social media influencers are actually real people and Matt really brings that back into reality.  Also do NOT underestimate yourself because you are genuinely such a funny, charismatic and interesting person! Love u 💕💕
video game videos is a great idea!! just letting you know so you might do some sometime 😳👀
matt, you’re so real for this one
Matt...youre literally my favorite
i wanna see more anxiety
Who is this ?
You’re such a stud. And you’re so well spoken holy crap. You really know yourself and are motivated to watch it back a grow because of it and that’s insane bro. Lots of people don’t have that. You’re crushin it.
hes so wholesome, hes honestly such a genuine and comforting person. I love him so so so much.
I absolutely LOVED this video so muchhhh and I love just watching you talk about your opinions on things and just talking. You definitely need more screen time so hearing you talk this much is so interesting somehow and intriguing just to listen to you talk. I also really like that you’ll be talking about your anxiety, yourself and other ideas you may have later on because it can influence so many more people including myself <3
WAIT CUZ THIS IS ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD💪❤
literally loved this video keep making them
I have anxiety too. Would be good to talk about mental health. Mental health is a hot topic right now.
He reminds me of myself, my low self esteem and anxiety. I’m glad one of my favorite content creators shares a nice safe place where he can talk and share about these things. Matt if you’re seeing this please know that you are loved by many and I’m very grateful for u.
Oml I love Matt so much
I’m so excited for all the anxiety talk <3
Honestly just listening to you talk is entertaining, you are most definitely not boring, keep doing you <3
14:11 I get that same thing with the memories
hi matt:))
No idea who this is.
YOUR VIDEOS #29 TRENDING

Matt you are not boring you’re just more mellow compared to your brothers but your personally is awesome and you honestly seem like such a kind and comforting person. I’m so excited for your future videos💗
this was so fucking calming
the editing for this is so funny i love the little purple segments in between lmfao
If you have to swear on the 3rd word in your video, then you have a real problem. Looking at the comments from some of the people here, no wonder society is going to HELL in a handbasket.
I have super heavy anxiety as well and I really wanna see your  take on it
maybe try like outfit ideas with clothing hauls or clothes you already have, i really love your fits!!
love u matt
I think you did pretty good!  I hope you keep them coming.
loved this matt, need proof of you being a wizard on cello next
So it’s a life success competition between the triplets

Ughhh he’s so cute I can’t it’s crazy seeing a video of just matt by himself I love it seeing him talk
MY MAN IS TRENDING 🥰🥰
I know this might be a weird video idea lol. But I was thinking like you being your brothers butler for 24 hours but idk lol
I LOVE MATT SM
Matt this was so entertaining to watch! I struggle with anxiety and have for a while as well. I would love to hear your experience with anxiety and thanks for the great video Matt. ❤️
Matt are you watching the Red Sox game tonight

the pink thing is so funny
i'd stop making videos right now. This is the worst.
"oh, peace out" ...pause... "we're definitely gonna need some work, that's all I gotta say..." Omg he's my actual favorite and I'm really excited for more of his content ❤❤❤
Love the elevator music
i'm love watching u and ur brother vids and i enjoyed this a lot. ur entertaining even on ur own lol
YOUR #28 in trending!!!!!
I love him so much <3. And he's not boring at all, he's funny as fck
Great lead in with an f bomb. How original. Blocked
You have separation anxiety with your brothers, I used to have it with my mom, I grew out of it I think you can too
Matt u are amazing and u are enough
i would rather shit in my hand and clap
#24 on trendinggggggg
You don’t have attachment issues. You’re a triplet. You’re meant to be with your brothers so it’s understandable that you have a lot of anxiety about it. But don’t feel obligated to make personal videos. Do it when you have something to talk about or genuinely just want to share something. Hell, make it a mukbang channel if you please 😭 Good job with your first video 🤍
UR SO FUNNY
absolutely living for the Matt content right now
matt i am beyond proud of you! you doubt yourself a lot because you feel like you are apart of nick and chris and i completely understand why but you’ve got it! i love you sm and u inspire me a lot because i also have anxiety and i also want to be a creator so thank you for just being real and being you. much love ❤️
Matt I promise you’re not boring I could literally keep listening to you all day and I would never get bored of you please don’t doubt yourself <3
I love this sm<3
you are NOTT BORING  lovvvv THIS VIDEO OMG FEEEEL THE SAME THANKS BECAUSE NOT LOTS OF YOUTUBERS DO THIS 💗💜❤
You should make a video where you talk about your favorite moments in videos with nick and chris
matt, this may have been one of my favorite videos i’ve seen from you, i love seeing your personality shine through when you’re by yourself <3 (also please keep the screaming outro)
Hi Matt! I think this will be good for you.  Just do you. You have as much to give as anyone.  I think you will find many of are much like you so you are not alone.   You are interesting and entertaining so just go for it and screw anyone who doesn't like it.  I'll be looking for more of you!  -jon
i hate that matt thinks hes boring alone. i just feel like he listens more than talks on the triplet’s channel. i hope he will be able to show more his own personality on here!
I publish on my channel different and useful children's toys 👶🧸 that develop intelligence 🧠 and activity. 👏 Subscribe to the channel to watch a new video and a new game every day. 📹😍
PLEASEE do anxiety talks
Anytime any of them try to explain something that seems like it doesn't make sense always makes sense to me if that makes sense, I always understand what they mean. Also this video was just do comforting and not finishing thoughts and anxiety is all so relatable for me, I love this
also i have played the recorder trumpet and cello but was never good at it ong
It’s okay Matt take a breather we love you don’t underestimate yourself!<3
Plz do a talk abt anxiety
I love this so much matt i’m going to enjoy your videos so much even tho u think your videos could be boring they won’t be because we will enjoy them so much and once u start making more videos it will be less awkward for u and we all love and support u <3

One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates..🟥
No matt you're not boring. We like you so much. This channel will be my safe place 💙
Talks about Anxiety and or even depression I know will be my favorite cause that's I struggle with that the most
This was such a comforting video because it just felt like a talk between the two of us like a FaceTime, I forgot I was watching a YouTube video
Just met you today on YouTube but you are cool I’ll definitely sub
#21 on trending 😳😳
MATT YOU ARE NOT BORING I PROMISE!! I LOVE YOU SO MUCH
Time is short   To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
some video ideas:  - who knows me better? chris or nick?  - day in the life  - talks about anxiety/mental health/struggles/ways to cope w anxiety (ONLY IF YOU ARE COMFORTABLE W THIS)  - who knows me better? parents vs brothers  - video games   i hope they helped? just a few ideas hahah, amazing video btw!
Don't doubt yourself too much. You seem to already have an idea of what you want to do but are somewhat hesitant. So I would say go for it. Just start with a video that says something about you that you would want others to see. I'm sure others will be impacted by the content you make. Idk if this makes any sense lol but you'll do great at it!  Good luck on your channel 👍
I feel so proud of him !!! go you Matty B don’t doubt your self 💓your amazing x
im so glad you said you’re going to talk about anxiety because it’s so true what you said, like it’s not really talked about at all and having anxiety myself has been something i have struggled with for so many years now and it’s such an awful feeling. thank you for doing this honestly i really appreciate it and im sure everyone else does aswell. also, amazing video 💛
🤔
Matt. You're awesome, honestly
You are amazing...don't be awkward at all..you are completely relatable.  you're perfect in your own way... just keep believing in yourself...everything will work out...love u Matt🙃
comfort person <3
matthew i love you so fucking much, seriously. you make so good, thank u for existing, my precious boy!! you are my safe place.
Don’t doubt yourself that much. Do your thing. We’re loving it :)
Over 200k views and 50k likes within a day your honestly a beast for that!!!!!
Matt you can do literally ANYTHING EVER and we would watch. So stop underestimating yourself!!!!
Also don’t really matter how good or bad you do it’s just practice!! We all support you much love ❤️
Honestly bro I’ve never seen or heard of you or your brothers YouTube but I have extremely bad anxiety and I really feel like I was meant to watch this. Also your awkwardness is so refreshing lol it reminds me of me so hard I love it and you just gotta sub.
im so proud of you matt ! we all love you and you have no idea how much people you make smile or just be happy by doing a simple video like this i love youuu <3
MATTTTTTT  GUESSSSS WHATTTTT IM ROOTING FOR YOU MA BOY IM PROUD OF YOUUUU I PERSONALLY THINK YOU ARE QUITE ENTERTAINING SO YA THATS ALL I GOTTA SAY🫡🫠
17:20 I thought he said "subscribe baby" at first. i almost had a heart attack
LET US KNOW ONCE U GET UR PLAQUE MATT UT AT A 100K SUBSCRIBERS <3
We love & support u always Matt💙🙏🏻u did good
MATT LOW KEY SOUNDS LIKE A BIRD WHEN HE SCAREMED AT THE END LMAO😰😭
Most of the time we’re getting nick, Chris, and Matt. I think this will be nick because will get to see Matt “one on one” and get to know him as a person and who he is as an individual and not just them as a whole/siblings. He doubts him self and it’s so sad, he barely looked directly at the camera. Honestly I think I speak for everyone when I say we’d watch anything you decided to record, just be more confident! Your doing great. Most people can’t even record a video and upload it onto the internet.
i love u matty b, literally i relate with 100, u can do whatever makes you happy, maybe try something without nick and chris.
COOKING WITH MATT!!!
matt i loved this video <3
I love you so much
“DAMN I WAS BLOWING EVERYTHING” LMFAOO 💀💀
matt omg stop down talking yourself . it breaks my heart. you are totally entertaining by yourself and i could watch you alone for hours. u bring comfort. you got this !!! i love you
this is actually so cool. extremely proud of Matt, he’s getting out of his comfort zone and trying to get better at doing stuff by himself, which is actually the main goal of this channel. hearing him process his thoughts and express them without being interrupted is extremely comforting and let’s us get to know him better. can’t wait to see his next video
lol honestly i don't even know who you are or why youtube thinks you matter.
Loved this so much <3
ur voice is incredible.
Funny gaming moments or horror games wud be funny to see u scared
matt we love you and ur not boring.
Life’s a test from god, be sure to study 📚
i was so comfortable watching this video, i never felt this comfortable ever i swear
I never thought I'll end up smiling for 18 minutes and 22 seconds straight over some guy talking about his anxiety and mental health (mostly)
you are lovely matt! i’ll watch whatever you put out, you are super entertaining!!❤️‍🩹
he makes me feel comfortable with my anxiety :)
That’s like me I have a twin called Kate and me and her feel like that
hes over 107k ALREADY. absolutely insane
omg matt i love you sm your so sweet <3 i can wait for you to post more vids! don’t doubt yourself your so entertaining :)
I LOVE THIS KID
i relate to you so much, i have so much anxiety now that i started uni...like i moved to a different country and i can't do sh*t alone... but  i literally made like no friends cause i get so nervous and i always think people are judging me bc im too dumb and just not interesting , and my anxiety is so bad i must mentally prepare myself 2 hours ahead just to go buy grocery.. i can only break this vicious cercle during summer break when i get my personality back and im surrounded by my confort people/family,  anyways sorry for ranting, have a good rest of your day. :)
Ok but only triplets/twins understand the separation anxiety that comes with being a twin/triplet,( this goes for quads,quints,whatever lol)
this was actually so good and entertaining. fully not boring at all. real proud matty boy👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
We will always be here to support you. We appreciate the effort you put doing this vid, you deserve everything you have and a lot more. Keep doing what you like❤️
i love how matt edits
17:21 ''baby'' will live forever in my head. Ok
Why is this shit trending
OMG MATT WAS BLOWING EVERYTHING!!! AYOOOO
i struggle  with anxiety too since like a year now (?) and i didn't find anything to stop it so if any of you have tips to fight against it, it would be really nice of you !! :)  (also sorry for my english, i'm french sooo)
love u Matt, you really seem like a nice, genuine, and adorable person <3
matt please do a video on anxiety. ur so funny completely my fav. LOVE YOUU
https://youtu.be/TqW2IQrnlZw
Matt reminds me of me
this kid has my heart bro
The way I understand everything in this video😂😂 looking forward to your videos:))
I can’t wait to see your personal growth Matt. 🫶🏽 Maybe try going to the mall by yourself to get lunch and shop and  take us with you. 🥰
honestly this alone was entertaining ☠️ your a cool person, don’t doubt yourself !!
hi Matt🫶🏻 i loved this video, i feel like we are kinda similar, i understood what you wanted to explain the thing about your brothers and feeling like you’re boring and all that, i sometimes feel the same way. about the anxiety thing too, sadly. also i had a unexplainable feeling watching this video, i felt comfortable and i enjoyed hearing you just talking and getting to know you more. i’m glad being here since the beginning. thank you, i hope you have a great day and i hope see you soon here in your personal channel, love you<3
I have to take a water with me everywhere because I get anxiety that I will feel lightheaded :/
I watched the podcast that you were in and you literally explained my entire school year this year. I have missed so much school and have had two therapists because I have such harsh anxiety
Matt, congrats on hitting 100k in one week! I am so proud of you, your amazing and a great person. Keep up the great work 🫶🏼💓
Omg
Zzzzzz
i would actually really like to see a in depth day in the life on any or all of your guys's personal channels, i feel like it would be a great way for the fans to interact and learn more about each of you individually.
Place your faith on Jesus. Jesus died so that you can have everlasting life. Jesus is the way the truth and the life, no one gets to the Father but by him. Trust Jesus. Repent   Have a good day.
Also, 2 vid ideas which I would love to see are reacting/rating confessions and sending your past crushes quizzes. I've seen so many of them and they are so funny :)
I’m so proud of you
There's honestly no need to worry if you're doing it right or wrong because us fans will love you no matter the content you post. You've got this completely. Rooting for you in every way and will be here to watch your vids. I really like all your ideas for videos and I think talking about anxiety would be amazing because a lot of us struggle with it as well. Hopefully you can post more than once a month, but i'll be here either way!
Good luck with your personal Chan :)!
You make perfect sense, don't say that you are boring because it's not true, you are an amazing person and I will always watch your videos no matter how often do you post, because it isn't boring and I love your personality and I wish you the best with this channel. Thank you for putting effort into an own channel it means a lot me because you are one of my comfort creator!<3 (also, sorry for my English)
You're not boring matt, you're an amazing person with a beautiful soul❤️ so nice you hear you talk about yourself, can't wait for more of these❤️
The little thing he does with his eyes is so cute
Honestly, you guys all together are rly funny, but by yourself, you have a different kind of humor which I love.Its rly cool that we get to see that. Thanks, Matt 😁
This video is #17 on trending in the UK!!! 💛
The little edit's reacting to what he said are the best. Like I was going to say that. Damn you rly be blowing everything got me  😂
Honestly I am happy I have someone to relate to since I have such bad anxiety
👏👏👏
Honestly love the videos with nick and chris but rn it’s 12pm and i’m getting ready for bed and something about the way you talk is really calming so dw too much about being entertaining, just do whatever u feel like doing, it’s your channel:)
thank you so much for sharing… you probably don’t think so but it really means a lot too so many people. to say i’m proud would be an understatement. never doubt yourself… we love you <3
"Where is Nick when I need him?" the cutest
you are entertaining in ur own way.. also yes pls videogames and anxiety vids 🫶
I really liked the editing hahaba
I like how we will be able to see other sides of your personality on your personal channels
I could listen to him talk for the rest of my life no doubt
petition to bring back wizard cello Matt
I love u matt
i'm not sure how to explain my feelings. I keep telling the people i care about how i feel like i'm dreaming because nothing feels real. Sometimes i look at my friends and family and think to myself are you real? When i was in school i got so low that i lost my friend group i was the only girl in a group of 3 boys, we knew each other for many years and they became like family, so it was hard loosing them. I haven't been in school for 5 months it got too hard for me to stay there. I don't like being round loads of teenagers, i feel so lost. I started hurting myself because it is the only way i can feel real at least for a little while. I'm scared to leave the house for a walk because i'm scared of running into someone i know. It's like i have these voices in my head, they get so loud. I feel like a crazy person. I'm so drained, everyday i'm drained but it's not even like i'm doing anything, so why do i feel this way? I'm 15, i just wanna wake up.
DUDE THIS VIDEO IS #16 ON TRENDING
your not boring i love you so much and everyone will love whatever you come up with :)
It's not rlly up on us what you do with your personal channel bc it's your channel If you don't do what YOU want it'll be less fun for us too yk Love ya<3
Honestly i really think you are such an interesting person.
in the best way possible this feels like the first day of school every year when teachers tell you what to expect from the class
It breaks my heart when you say your boring your honestly not <3
You are not boring matt absolutely not, im laughing so hard even if you say nothing funny, you are yourself dont change it, we love this matt and your are enough dont doubt about yourself, because you think chris or matt are more funny, you are all different and funny in your own way

matt calling himself boring makes me upset. he’s literally the reason i started watching them. i saw a video on tik tok and i found him entertaining and funny. he brings himself down too much. he’s literally amazing!!
no ik exactly what you mean bc the attachment issues. i’m the same way with my mom.
Why do you people make these guys  famous
anxiety related videos will be PERFECT for ppl like me that struggle with it…💜
You aren't boring and stop doubting yourself we love you <3
WE LOVE YOU MATT🥰
i feel like all the topics you said are great, especially for the beginning of your channel!!! we just wanna get to know you man, and i feel like a great place to start would be your interests, like clothes and stuff like you said!!!! i’m genuinely happy you decided to make a personal channel too, even if you’re not fully consistent, i will definitely be consistently checking to see when u post!!!!!!!!

OKG HEY
Proud of you matt!
dude i absolutely love that you have your own channel now so we can see how you guys are individually. we love you and you're not boring to us, you're matt! that's enough. <33
I love that you have a personal channel now!! You don't get to talk a whole lot in the triplet videos so it is really nice to hear you talk and what you have to say. Please don't ever think you are boring lol because I was thoroughly entertained watching this.
I LOVE THIS MORE THEN MY SELF
your amazing bruh ✌️😮‍💨
I just happened to come across this video. You a triplet I can understand how  you can feel the ways you do (I have 5 sons) I have one who can get into these "fits" I'm starting to think it's a form of anxiety. Just watching I see this will help you to grow into your next level of a young man you are personalizing yourself vs being apart of the 3.. Good job keep growing you got this 💛
i watched this video yesterday and ive been thinking about it all day so here i am again
You have no idea how much you've helped others start new things as well. I've talked myself out of starting my own channel so many times but this could be a new beginning! And you did great! 🫶🏼
@Maria Sim they're on my youtube now
PLS POST MORE
i fr relate to you so much because i have very severe anxiety and attachment issues. it just feels so nice for people to talk about stuff like thats because litteraly noone does. so i really love that you talk about it <3
The screech sounded like Kevin from UP😭😂
take us as your therapist
omggggggg
Love you
Honestly you having a yt channel and believe even with the tiniest belief that you can do it has already helped me with my anxiety. Thanks
Matt is a big fat mood, deffo do the video games !!
i honestly love how they each have their own channels and the group one. it really highlights each of their personalities and lets us get to know them as individuals too. they never fail to make me laugh and i’m so proud of how far they’ve come 🫶🏻
Loved this SO MUCH!
❤️❤️❤️❤️
matt you should do a ransom clothing walk thru like chris did with lyrical lemonade:)
i love you matt, so whatever you end up doing i’ll gladly support you :)
The way I relate to you is amazing
❤️
matt wow. this video was incredible. i feel like u think people come to the sturniolos channel for nick and chris when that is so NOT the case. we come for ALL OF U. we love u boys. this personal video really really resonated with me. i think the reason u r my favorite triplet (no offense nick and chris lol) is just because i relate to u the most. i feel most connected and comfortable with you. i have struggled to deal with depression and anxiety my whole life and i think a lot of fears u have (like driving or being alone) r what i fear as well!  i think u did an outstanding job on this video!! ur editing, ur content it was AMAZING!! i am so so sooo soooo proud of u!! PLEASE HAVE MORE FAITH IN URSELF!!! love u❤️
You should do a "lookbook" video each month, of all your best outfits or what you think your style consisted of that month.
the only thing we ask is to be yourselves, never change for our account, please don’t forget that! honestly the more yourselves u guys are the more entertaining and organic it is. That applies to all creators actually
I'm so happy he has his own channel he can talk as much as he wants 😭❤️❤️I love thier own channel too
THIS IS A VÍDEO OF JUST HAPPINESS FOR ME HOLY SHITTTT!
Can you please start kissing the camera goodbye again, i was excited and you just said peace out and then screamed
I can already tell this channel is gonna do good cause  it's just to relatble
Youre not borning. I love how youre branching out and trying to figure out what your channel is going to look like.
This video is trending and he reached 100k subs THAT IS INSANE HE DESERVES IT couldn’t be prouder of him
i loved this
Hear me out... roblox video
There's no need for you to feel obligated to be "entertaining"! If you want to play videogames but don't know what to talk about in the meanwhile, you could maybe play more story based games like The Walking Dead or The Last Of Us. They do most of the talking for you lol. But yeah don't feel like your obligated to be someone you're not or that you have to upload here every week :)
The random pink screen with writing are my literal internal thought whilst watching this video
Dont worry about being boring! This is a great first video of you figuring out what you want your channel to be! I love you!!!
Lol, this is 16 on trending
YES MATT ❣️
You are amazing keep doing this,because you’re not boring and alaways help me when I am in a bad mood.Love you so much 🤍🤍
Congrats on 101k and #16 on trending!!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉 so happy for youuuuuu
I would love for you to anxiety talk videos!! It's something I also struggle with 😔❤️❤️❤️
Stop- at the end of the video I was expecting Matt’s video kisses but I got a pterodactyl scream.
Excited for all the new videos you make in the future!! Ilyyyy💗💗💗
I really loved this video Matt!!! 💕💕💕
Who is this guy?
I'm liking the cuts for your comments
Aww i love this!! We love u matt
Someone walked behind the car in the beginning of the video and my soul left my body😅
You’re getting your own plaque!!
So so freakin proud of you Matt!!❤️
17:04 looks like you guys are gonna have to tell me again lmao
the ending is so funny! I love you Matt!
I have anxiety and I can totally relate ! Your awesome Matt and don’t forget that ! 🫶🏽

He is adorable! So sweet and genuine:) don't ever say your boring because u aren't

Dangle earrings ewww
OMG I LOVE THIS AAAAAAA<3333
Omg!!! You’re awesome! This video is amazing❤️‍🔥
I know the feeling you speak of. You are not boring, you are an amazing and wonderful person. And I would watch your videos even if you were sitting without saying anything, do you know why? Because the simple fact that you are there, doing what you like the most is enough.  I love you so much, and don't forget this is. a phrase from a book that I love, "The quietest are those who always have better things to say."  ♥️♥️♥️
Loved this video, you seem like an amazing person❤️❤️
you and your brothers have created a foundation on the internet where people don’t only just like your content, but like you. you’re a good human being with a lovable, witty personality and we like YOU! you’re all good, no more doubting yourself, you keep exceeding everyone’s expectations. have fun and trust your instincts! you really do have it covered! (side note: i always think it’s funny when you call yourself “boring” bc i find you to be very eloquently spoken and the most interesting to listen to? KNOCK IT OFF UR NOT BORING. SHHH. ♥️♥️♥️)
I love you Matt  https://youtu.be/WaH186g87zM
We all love you matt don’t ever think your boring and let the haters hate ☺️
"You get them when you get them, and you don't get them when you don't get them" Mathew Sturniolo 2022 I may get it tattooed 😂😂
No bc imagine if Chris was laying in the truck all along
so i think that chris and nick may be funnier or more entertaining but you are definitely the most relatable one (and not boring at all) and that’s something that is really great about you <33
I love uuuuuuu, maybe do a mukbang with your mom or dad and answer questions about anxiety and your teen years❤️❤️❤️💕💕💕🥰
so i think that chris and nick may be funnier or more entertaining but you are definitely the most relatable one (and not boring at all) and that’s something that is really great about you <33
I love this so much and I relate so much the amount of times I loose train of thought is insane
Omg I would love to hear some advice for calming anxiety...could u possibly do a vid about that...thanks
ily

Hi Matt. I just wanted to remind you that you are loved and you are an amazing person . I’m so proud of you for stepping out of your comfort zone and trying something new!! Thank you for talking about mental health I’m sure you’ve really connected to a lot of people . You’ve got this Matt!!
100k subs and #16 trending. Proud of you Matt
Mans got 100k subscribers from 1 video-
No this kind of video is great if u like it! I think u do videos u are comfortable about doing. And if u like them then we like them!
I'll really like if u'll talk about u're anxiety, cause I struggle with anxiety too, so I think it would be really entertaining but it would also be good cause not many people talk about this on social media, so yeah, i think it's a good idea.  Btw I love u ❤
Matt number 16 on trending!!!!! I’m way beyond proud of you and I’m so excited for you to post and to grow with you 🤍
you’re amazing, i love u so much.

Please don't be nervous about whether or not you are "boring", cause you most definitely aren't. You have such a comforting personality and it would be great if you could take your personal channel as an opportunity to develop more as an individual. I struggle with anxiety myself and it would be great if you could talk about your experiences with it, cause it definitely isn't talked enough about! Congrats on your first video :)
Oh u can do drive threw vlogs! Because u are the only one that can drive. Or if u feel comfortable driving and filming at the same time, u can do a drive around vlog. :)
matt, you‘re hilarious and you’re doing great! feels like face timing a good friend 💗

so glad to see more of u, i relate to u a lot <3
bro i love u so much im so happy your branching out of your comfort zone
Bruh I fucking love you, I wish I could be there to reassure you and boost your confidence. I’m a triplet too and I understand how weird it is to be alone lmao. Keep it up, great first video.
So proud💕
I had a really bad anxiety day yesterday but you opening up about your anxiety makes me feel like I'm not alone. Thank you Matt!😊
U can tell much he loves nick and Chris because of how much he talks about them even when there not there
thank you for opening up, i feel so understood whenever you talk about your feelings and i’ve never felt quite understood, you make me not feel alone . i hope you could see yourself in our eyes bro and realize how amazing you truly are
You dont have to scream ur head of for your content to be good, sometimes i just want to relax after a day and these types of videos are amazing
to be completely honest you mentioning anxiety is something tht kinda made me feel less alone... rn my anxiety has been spiking so you mentioning it was a bit of a relief. apart from that i think that claiming you are boring would take away some of the credit because im sure as hell tht everyone would notice if you werent in any of your videos or if you were sad or unhappy. we would all agree in saying that entertainment is a broad scale, and what could be seen as potentially boring to others, could be the most entertaining shit ever. excuse my french. but anyway to say the least im proud of you for this video and beyond excited to see where you go and how you grow throughout all this
S sound weird but I’ve never heard u talk this much in a video obviously but I love it if feels like from one person o another that’s confusing basically i know I’m going to enjoy watching this channel more than I thought
This video was amazing, the editing was Soooo funny. I loved it!!!!!
Okay, great. I will try pickle juice in a 6 foot realm from you then!
Not u posting a video before nick I thought u would be posting last yayayayay so happy u posted
we love you Matt
could honestly listen to you all day, trust me you are not boring. i relate to you on so many levels so it’s so comforting to hear someone else talk about the same struggles. i love you so much matt and i’m so excited to see more videos
SPOTIFY PLAYLIST TOUR !!! Making new ones as well would be cool.
I love this type of video so keep do these and your not boring, you help me with so much ❤️❤️
The amount of times you’ve said sth that i relate to is absolutely insane. I loved loved this video so much ur genuinely a kind soul.Keep up the good work matt we love and will support u forever <3cant wait for ur upcoming content!!
this video should be titled ‘matt sturniolo not being interrupted by nick and chris for 18 minutes straight
hi matt thank you for this very entertaining video excited to see more <3
i’ve never seen anyone describe pickles as ‘pretty cool’
This was the best video i ever watched it’s literally so calming to listen to you
i love this, it feels so comfortable
Hey matt can u bring the kisses back ♡♡♡
will you have an intro or outro?
God, I was smiling the whole time. It was a great start - calm, comfortable and relaxing. Big difference between the main channel and this one but very positive. Believe in yourself, Matt❤️
Love you boy I'm happy that you have your own channel ☹️🫶🏻.
My babie🥺💗💗💗.
THE INTERNET PART
omg you should do fashion related stuff i love your style
i absolutely love this video, the talking abt anxiety is so comforting and please never say ”i’m boring” again, cause it’s not true !!! <3
the way he says “me” is the most boston accent i’ve heard in him
Pls matt this was so entertaining I can’t even I need more of these I swear I loved the editing the way u roasted urself w the music was so hilarious
i literally sat here watching the whole video with the fattest smile on my face… he’s so wholesome
matt you are thoroughly entertaining even without nick and chris🫶🏻

I LITERALLY LOVE YOU SM
hi matt i just wanted to say that i'm really grateful and proud of you for starting this channel and being willing to talk about your anxiety. i also wanna reassure you that you're not boring or bland. you're an amazing, sweet, thoughtful, funny and smart human being and we all appreciate you and are excited to get to know you better. i understand it might be awkward for you filming without nick and chris at first but it's gonna get better with time and you'll get used to it. anyway i can't wait for your future videos and i love you so much ❤️🥰
this is so weird with him alone in the car… BUT I LOVE IT
i love it.
don't worry matt, it is great, believe us, is entertaining (Funny intro btw)
why did i feel i needed mental preparation for this Edit: the fact that as i was watching the video he had 98K subscribers and i paused for a few minutes, came back, refreshed and now he has 100k makes me rlly happi idk why
bestie its not even 10 seconds in and you have already said bitch
Damn this Video was sooo joyful to watch. Matt your fucking amazing!
Wow first video and your already nearly at 1M subscribers! I’m so glad that you started this Channel! Also good job focusing the camera haha 🤣💀
OMGGG don’t doubt yourself Matt!!! We love you FOR WHO YOU ARE and nothing else. I love this new format please continue you’re so cool <33

Can you kiss the camera goodbye for your outro 🥺🥺
Yes to: clothing haul and jewlery tour kinda, anxiety talks!!!, pranks, day in my life,
I would love to see you cooking or something like that!
Lmao I still have my recorder. I also played trumpet😂. I was good at it but now I still play on my recorder every once in a while but I stick to piano now💀
I also loved the sarcastic comments you were making 😭
Matt this was absolutely amazing. you panicked a lot but seriously you’re good. congrats on your first video. woohoo🥳❤️
I appreciated this video SO MUCH like literally thank you for putting aside all your “entertainment uncertainties” because it would have been a shame not to give this a try and you’re doing GREAT
You're not boring i mean no matter what you do you're not boring not to me love you so much and I can't wait for more videos ❤️
he loves nick and chris so much its so comforting
i love his editing tbh😭 matt please don’t doubt yourself. u don’t have to be “entertaining”, being urself is all that matters to most of us❤️ u make a lot of us feel appreciated and loved even if u don’t think so. ur not boring at all so please don’t think about anything negative like that!
my favorite triplettttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt yes
I've been waiting for this 😀
stop being so harsh on yourself!! we love u
Matt you are not boring, don’t worry I actually really enjoyed watching this as it lets us get to see you more for you.  Can’t wait to see more of your individual video.
nooo don't ever say you're boring. you are not boring. this video was honestly amazing and everybody loved it! keep doing what you're doing we love you
omg the "well said keep living your life" was amazing
ahhh he classic screams at the end he gotta keep that in for every on of his videos 🤍
aww matt you're doing greaaattt!!! cant wait for for the next videoss<3
I loved this videooo
LMAO love the dry humor the editing was 🤌excited to see more!
Why does your lighting look so good tho
i loved it sooooooooooooo much i cant wait for whats coming
i love the editing!!!😘
Did a great job!!!
i hope you know we’re all looking forward to your channel!!
I think you need to give yourself some more credit!  You have relatability going for you - sooo many people watching will relate to your anxiety, doubts and attachments and you'll not only be able to help them out but they'll be able to support you! So it's commendable to step out on your own and share your voice and perspective on life and all things.
i’m so proud of you Matt, i find you very entertaining and i’m so excited to see more videos with just you <3
Hahaha the way he forgot what to say and then he said «fuck» all the time😆😆😆
awww this whole video had me going "aww matt"
THE ELEVATOR MUSIC I CANT-
I love Matt I can’t wait to watch his channel I can already tell I’m gonna love it :) my fav triplet
k but this editing is GOD TIER
I literally saw a different Matt in this video and I'm here for it
The scream at the end never fails to make me laugh
This video made me feel so safe and comfortable, just like hanging with a friend❤
love to hear u talk for once 😄
this is so exciting ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
This made me smile. I'm excited to see more from you!
Maybe pranks
Can't wait for the anxiety talks, i feel like i can relate. Also, maybe u ca be the boy version of emma chamberlain but in a more unique way of ur own.
you’re so relatable
matt i seriously loved this video cause it made me so calm. and this was so fun to watch and made me come down to earth if that makes sense. i hope u keep posting on here, ur gonna do so good.
you're doing so so well matt! you got this <3
i fucking loved this video, it made me so calm. ur so calming. please continue with these, i love it sm.
you're doing great matt :) i struggle with anxiety as well and i feel like its not talked about or taken seriously so having someone talk about it and relating to is so comforting, can't wait to see more if your channel<3
he doesn't know how much we love him and his personality!!
Matt I just wanted to say that you are not boring and we all love you so very much! You literally brighten up my day! And when you talk about your anxiety it makes me feel better about mine. Love you Matt!
number ten on trending- congrats matt ily!!!
matt is always entertaining for me idc!! LOVE YOU MATT
MATT IS THE CUTEST I LOVE HIM SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!
im so damn proud of you
you don't necessarily have to be making jokes and doing extravagant things for it to be entertaining, sit-down videos where you just talk are just as fun to watch. I think the anxiety videos will be beneficial for a lot of people on here and it's a nice change of pace from the triplet videos
Go matt go matt go matt
He be like, " do I have to tap it?" Luv that 😂
WE NEED MORE OF THIS!!
matt is amazingg!! I LOVE MATT SO MUCH<333!!
Just kidding I'm sorry
Dude the pickle and sidekick answers are legendary 😂
"in the most not pick me way possible "
I get really bad anxiety too. It was really comforting to me that you experience that too. I have a twin and get really bad attachment issues when he is not with me. It's a very weird feeling.
I love you so much. You are so much fun and the absolute sweetest
honestly, i was so glad when y'all started talking about making personal channels cause i really wanted to see more of each of you alone. and especially matt, since he usually talks less in videos. also, matt said he was boring. sir. you are very much not. this video just made my entire day and im sure many people felt the same. you're so funny and your editing had me dying. i can't wait to see more videos of just you having fun and chatting. as someone who has been struggling with anxiety for a while, i'd love to see you discuss that more.   rooting for you!!
this is the things that are so amazing about humans; we can get entertained just by watching someone talk, and talk about their experience, it doesn’t even have a big thing.
I was really not feeling it today and I was dreading about tomorrows plans I decided to sit down and watch this, distracted me straight away and I feel way less stressed now, these sit-down videos are supr comforting bro
Matt don't worry we really enjoy any kind of your content cause its yours its authentic and original. You are really funny and "boring" is a word l'd never use to describe you. We love you and l hope you get a lot of support 🙂 ❤️
Matt the video couldn’t have been more perfect, it could never be boring, your doing a great job keep doing what your doing because it’s working.
i love you matt
wait the outro was so cute tho hahaha ❤️
Video games would be a great idea. And you are not boring, nobody is for that matter you just have to find the right people to entertain. Keep doing what you are doing and remember that if you want to eat during the video or need to take a break from talking that you can always cut it out of the vid. Best of luck <3
I really enjoyed this video, you're relatable on many levels, very honest, open about talking about stuff and I really appreciate that. it was such a comforting thing to watch, just like a little conversation with a little joke here and there and a good time. I suck at talking about things that I like I struggled so much writing omg 😭
Well, this is new. 😌🤝
you did great Matt~ being an 18 yr old as well I can relate to almost everything you say… be it anxiety, overthinking about different things or even getting off topic every other second! But in the end, you’re doing just fine and there’s no rush <3 you can always take your time to sort things out! Best of luck with this channel bestie♥️
I literally died every time the pink screen came up, I couldn't stop laughing. Can't wait to see more content of yours :)
The random cuts with the texts have me rolling😭😭 IM CACKLING AT THE END HELP
Lol I was always told the way I think is weird, turns out that’s just the brain of an anxious person, I have had anxiety for as long as I can remember and was probably the worst when I was in school, but I started uni this year and idk y but my social anxiety has gotten a lot better, I think just getting out of my comfort zone and exposing myself to that stuff has helped but I’m so glad more people r talking about mental health, u got this, great vid🤙
THIS IS SO EXCITING MATT!!
MATT UR SO FUNNY AND GENUINE AND KIND YOU'RE NOT BORING WE LOVE YOU💗
AAAAH YES
Have you got a girlfriend??
i feel like this account will be such a safe place for everyone who has anxiety or is just struggling with anything. matt is such a comforting person
I love seeing videos like these it shows us a bit of your true self without being with your brother so we can see you as your true self
✨I enjoyed this video cant wait for the next one✨👍🏻🫶🏼💕
I loved the video so much🫶🏼 Keep it up Matt 👍🏻💗💕✨✨
matt, don’t doubt yourself and don’t put yourself down! you’re so special and sweet. i absolutely loved this video 💞
Matt this is so good for your first video! I don’t think it have to be perfect just if you have fun doing it so just do what you want!
You don’t have to entertain other people just do what you’re comfortable with and stuff you want cuz this your channel and people have to respect what you do
This is such a good thing to wake up too
I love this video 🙌🏻🙌🏻
GO MATT 🙌🏻🙌🏻
Saudi Arabia Fan <3
Well Hellooooooo my fav triplet
u think ur being boring but to us this makes everyone feel so validated for feeling similarity to u!! matt, u can literally sit in front of a camera and do nothing and it can be classed as ‘entertaining’. entertaining is a concept and not real at all. everything is ‘entertaining’ if u want it to be. stop coming at urself so much and being so harsh on urself, ur great by urself and with others!!
he relies on chris and nick so much which is so adorable, but i also really  hope he can do things in his own because he is gonna need to and am glad he is taking it positively 🤍🤍🤍🤍
You  can use your channel to share anything you want for real, I mean hobbies interests ... you are not boring, I mean everyone is interesting in a way. 😉 You do whatever you want. It's difficult to grew as individual when you are a tripled, enjoy what you want to do and be brave to explore 😀
:)
im a twin it mkes scense
i wrote another msg, but I forgot to add the fact that ur not boring AT ALL! ur my fav triplet and are completely underrated asf bro. ur vibe is everything dude, love u x
hey matt, u probs won’t see this, but I just wanna say that I’m so totally proud that you are progressing with ur anxiety. It makes me happy to know that it’s getting at least a little bit better and u can enjoy life a bit more. I look up to u for pushing on and creating content that makes millions laugh. U don’t realise how many people you have helped with simply smiling at the camera and being ur true self. I hope to be like you someday! Love u matty b xxx
His first video and is already #10 on trending. I’m really proud of you Matt and I already know that this new channel is going to be great!!
He is adorable
he`s so wholesome😭❤❤ really looking forward to new videos!!
Glad u uploaded this matt it's so good
you seem so sweet and this video was so cute ilyyyy 💕🫶🏻
yo i'm really looking forward to the anxiety talk because when I have anxiety, I usually feel like I'm the only one to have it, but knowing that I'm not makes me feel a lot better. Especially considering my favourite youtuber is discussing the matter.  Going through anxiety is difficult, and knowing that there is someone out there who is talking about it and telling (myself) and hundreds of other people that they are not alone is comforting.
He’s like the male emma chamberlain
YAAAY IM EXCITED
pls make more videos 🥺❤️  ~Fan - from Sri Lanka ❤️~
Love the video Matt keep up the great work! 💞
VIDEO GAMES VIDEO GAMES VIDEO GAMESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSss
I love him so much 😭
18:06 I love him sm ):
LOVE UR NEW PROFILE PIC ❤️🙈
14:17 YEAAAAHHH I USED TO THINK ABOUT THIS THEN YOU SAID IT HOW CRAZY
Love this channel
He could also do a series learning how to do new things
i genuinely loved this video sm !! can’t wait for future videos <3
When you said "I'm gonna talk about anxiety here a lot and I think it's not touched enough by creators community" it was mean a lot cuz I was expecting you to say this. Thank you so much because of you I as 22 years old psychology major who lives alone in a dorm different city than her  hometown I can finally be able to see myself as we see in class and everything make sense. I finally except I probably have a really heavy anxiety and all the stuff I did going through was not because Im only child or I was different than my friends. Thanks to you (btw before all I was at my worst in my life) I finally take the some anxiety tests we use in class and after the result Im going today to see a thearapist for my eaiting disorder and probably my anxiety. İt really game changing point in my life and mostly you and your brother make me feel good at this time and makeme feel okey about my eating disorder and probably my anxiety. You make me feel okey about I probably have anxiety and need to see a therapist or take antidep. İt was always there and maybe ıt can be weird to say that I hope it is not but it takes 2 decades to me making something about all that things. I would always rememeber you and your brothers effect on this at my journey when I tell people and do something about it. with all the love thank you
matt you’re doing so good!!!🥺🥺🫶 we love you so much, you got this! <3
What if Matt does movie or TV show commentaries or stuff like that? I watch ones like dylanisintrouble and they are so entertaining and wholesome. And since Matt likes that stuff I think it'd be fun to watch ☺️
PLEASE CAN WE GET COOKING VIDEOS
I'm so proud of you matt, you can do it and we love you
you should do like outfit ideas and we could put in requests for the occasion, also you aren't boring i promise i really enjoyed this video
This was amazing
Yeh, no thanks. Wants to use just too much dirt mouth
i'm so excited for the anxiety talks. i feel like this is gonna be such a wholesome channel and it's so great to see someone with anxiety speak up about it:)
Matt please don’t doubt yourself, we all enjoy things like this and you are not “boring“❤️
Matt let me just say this do what ever makes you the happiest. you talking about anxiety is already helping me and so many people who have it. you are entertaining in your own way. you should do like food challenges like eating gas station food all day. or just simply sit down talks in your car. either way your videos are great and we all love you so much.🤍
This my happy day , i love you plz keep going and you are NOT FUCKING BORING
#10 on TRENDING MATT. How exciting 🙈🙈
this video was so cool and calm i needed that today thanks <33
This was really relaxing to watch put me in such a chill good mood :)
It’s giving emma chamberlain vibes for some reason
YOO I PLAYED THE VIOLA ITS KINDA CLOSE TO THE CHELLO
I’m not saying this  to be nice but I reallyyyyy enjoyed this video
this is really refreshing! I never realized he has such a nice personality. Seems like a genuinely nice person
even if you just sit there the whole video, i'll still find it entertaining Matt! 😄
Matt, I can really emphasize with you that it’s hard to be comfortable alone and especially in front of a camera, with the fact that you’re always with your brothers. But I want you to know that your individual self and personality is very special and unique. To me you’re very thoughtful and funny, and a down to earth person. Just be yourself on camera, and we’ll love you for it. You’ve already made impact, and built a community. Just remember to be patient with yourself and kind to yourself on this journey. That being said, it’s awesome you already started!! I’m proud of you for doing this, because like you said its going to be a  great self-growth process.   Also, I deal with anxiety on a daily basis and it means a lot for someone like you to talk about it on here. I’m looking forward to those videos & I enjoyed this one!! Love you 💟💟
first of, this video was not boring at all!!!! entertainment can mean a broad range of things and this was definitely entertaining. i think that through this channel you can find ways to express yourself and connect or push yourself to do things by yourself! i think you have a lot to say as a person and a great personality and I'm excited to see where this channel takes you, whether that's driving around or talking about absolutely nothing or opening up about your anxiety, I'm sure ill enjoy it!!! love u matt
You could go to McDonald's on your own and get the workers to surprise you with a random bunch of food and then like review the order and just talk about random stuff🙃
IM CRYING ABOUT 13:24
Would love seeing lets plays from you i think it would be so fun to watch em!!
I will sit here and watch u watch paint dry like
#10 on trending already!!!
We love and appreciate u matt!
hes like a male version of emma chamberlain
i can’t wait for the anxitey talks, i’ve struggled with it for most of my life
i’m so proud of you i love this <3
btw very random, i have an older brother and our relationship is really good. but he is 8 years older and rarely home so i feel like an only child most of the time. but you, nick and chris lowkey feel like 3 extra brothers which is really fun. idk maybe more people feel like that
🥹🥹🥹ily always
He's so wholesome! 😭 He doesn't realize he's not boring. His voice us so soothing and I can listen to him talk on end. His comment in between were so cute and funny. I love you Matt and you're doing great 👍🏻
a few things 1. THIS EDITING IS PERFECT PLEASE DONT EVER CHANGE IT, THE PINK THINGY WITH THE MUSIC AHAHAHA 2.  matt ur not boring at all, this was very comforting and interesting to watch and you help so many people including myself, i can't wait for future videos!!! (why did i switch emotions so fast lmaooo)
matt i promise i laughed at lot at literally just this video, you’ll be fine x
Omg Matt if you say ur “boring” one more time Im going to have to yell at u until u realise ur not boring, ur funny, and  very entertaining and I’m so glad u talk about ur anxiety because u make me feel understood I love you STOP DOUBTING URSELF
you know you have nice fans when every comment is a paragraph long😭 anyway you did greattttt love u mattxxx
Honestly me and Matt are the same person <333
you are definitely not a boring person, just be you and I’m sure you’ll smash it! I know it’s hard to not overthink it but people will love your videos :) also talking about anxiety and addressing the struggles that you have is such a strong thing to do, thank you for helping others🤍
I love the editing 😭😭
oh my god matt ur so cute
When he said “i don’t have an outgrowth for this video yet” I was like “WHERE IS THE SCREAM” cuz he always screams at the end of a car vid and now I can say I’m satisfied 😌
feel free to post whenever you want to or just wanna talk about anything,no pressure.Sometimes videos like this are needed not only for us but for you as creators too.I personally really liked this video, it was a chance to get to know you a little better:)
I loved the editing 😭😭😭😭
we're the same person fr
He’s so cute
You are not boring you think you’re  Keep doing videos pls about anything 💗
I love it !! Please do moreee
I’ve got a video idea for wither this channel or ur shared channel but since u often go to McDonald’s I know it was a popular video thing about 4-5 years ago but the video idea is to go through the drive thru of McDonald’s and order whatever the person in front of u orders and if it’s not enough food than u should go round for each person in the car
i feel so bad for you. you're not boring, like not at all, i don't think you even realize how happy you makes us by simply watching you talk like even when you're not with his brothers. you're such an amazing person. and thank you so much for the anxiety talk since not many people talk about it but so many struggle with it, including me. love you!! <3
I relate to Matt so much I find it so hard so socialise with others my age especially in school and I also find myself quite uninteresting but I’ve accepted that about myself. Love how the sturniolo triplets(Matt,Chris and Nick) are doing their own thing and learning as an individual love u all, hope u don’t feel pressured to post just thankful for ur appreciation towards ur fans <33
And thank you for talking abt ur anxiety, it makes a lot of us feel less alone and I appreciate you extra much for that
I just wanted to tell you that you are not boring at all and, you are so much fun and you make me happy every day! You have helped me sm and I’m so proud of you. So don’t call yourself boring bc you’re not AT ALL! I love you matt, keep being you <3
I’m begging you to bring back the camera kiss at the end of every video
I liked this video very much! Please post more whenever ur ready
Please stop doubting yourself, you don’t need nick and chris to be entertaining so stop worrying ❤️
Sharing about your experience with anxiety is the best thing to do....it's gonna help loads of people. Thanks Matt :)
I love hearing Matt’s voice , I feel like I never really get to hear it😭. Also can we just appreciate just how heartfelt and genuine this video was 😁. I don’t like it when creators waste food or play really dumb pranks or try to entertaining on their personal channels . Like , we subscribe to personal channels to get to know you better and to know about what’s going on in your life , we don’t need you to be entertaining. Thankyou for this gem Matt🌸
the way he said internet lmao
matt, i want you to realise how much of an interesting person you are like no joke. you honestly remind me of myself there are times i doubt myself and feel like i’m just there in the background but other times i’ll be myself and just live in the moment yk. you don’t have to be an extrovert to be fun, it’s being yourself that makes it fun. i’m so looking forward to your videos and seeing how far you three go <3
This was so comforting to watch. I can't wait to see more of Matt. I really just wanna give him a hug.
ahhh i’m so excited for him 🤧🤧
matt your not "boring" you literally have such an impact In all the videos and literally make my day.
Slay slaaaaayyyy
this is personal cause i struggle with anxiety but just the fact you want to talk about anxiety because it’s not talked about enough in the entertainment industry already shows how sweet you are as a content creator. you’re never required to share your experiences but the fact you’d do that because you know many people struggle with it makes it super touching, so thank you for being a future safe place that people can come to <33
mf predicted everything while he was talking abt instruments I DEADASS FORGOT I PLAYED THE FLUTE IN 4TH GRADE and just remembered that shit.
matt, you just being yourself is enough content for us. you don’t have to be funny in order to have nice content!! but just to let you know, you’re not boring at alllll. so many people really love your sense of humor and even just your voice itself is super nice to listen to so try not to doubt yourself <3 we’re all really excited for your future content, you’re doing really great🤍
Omg the little notes were so funny💀
this is the best thing uve ever done to get out or your comfort zone, im proud of u! and i relate to u ALOT.
in addition to what everyone is saying (which i agree with!!) i wanted to say that the editing is great! it's very funny :)
These earrings are fire
You remind me of myself alot i think it’s a middle sibling kind of thing.also You’re not boring AT ALL you literally kept me entertained through the whole video love u matt♥️
idk if he realises that he could literally sit there in silence and i would absolutely adore the video
The editing is amazing matt
Matt your not boring!!!!
2:00 LMAO SAMEE but nahh i bet ur actually good at them and would love gaming content, really any content from you i would watch  coming from someone who grew up with 4 close sisters i completely understand what u mean when u say u feel like weird without ur brothers and how like u feel like u don’t have any if they aren’t with u 🤣😭
this was a perfect first video i loved it so much i really hope he keeps posting
"5'8 on a good day" 😭😭
congrats on your first video lover boy! ☺️♥️
I've had anxiety for years and i don't really feel comfortable talking abt it so I'm so proud of matt for taking that step and wanting to share 🤍
this is awesome matt i love u can’t wait for more videos!!
idk why but matt reminds me of emma chamberlain
i don’t know about the other viewers, but i found this video interesting! it really helps us get to know you more and just your whole personality.🫶🏼
matt not being able to speak abt one topic for long is so me💀
the little comments inbetween😭😭
clothing hauls yes!! anxiety talks >>>>
clothing hauls yes!! anxiety talks >>>>
I love this sm, growing up with anxiety is so isolating and lonely especially when you don’t have anyone to really relate to. I have selective mutism (a severe anxiety disorder) and I can barely even go to school, I’m there for maybe an hour per day and I just feel like I’m missing out on so much of my childhood hearing other people talk about all the things they did as teens. Also getting told “everyone has anxiety” is so frustrating like yeah I know but it makes it so much harder to do every day things and it feels like it needs to be worse all the time to “have a right to complain” but just having it almost all the time is just so draining even though it’s not severe most of the time. Especially having friends who are very social and does stuff you can’t do
DO HORROR GAMES
matt when he's not getting interrupted >>>
This was such a chill vid. I loved it with everything in me
your not boring Matt your an amazing person that people relate too<3
I loved this video so chill and cool. You can do some eating videos like buying McDonalds and just talking to us. It will be kinda cool. I’m waiting for the next video <333
YOU SHOULD KISS THE CAMERA AS YOUR OUTRO
"subscribe baby" already am baby
MATT I REALLY HOPE YOUR SEE THIS!!! I don’t really know where to give you some answers for the q and a but I would like to ask you, would you rather celebrities?! Like a kinda compare in a kind way of course! 💗💗
no joke this video was so entertaining
The way he said that if we found him without the group Chanel and said “Idk how on gods screen earth you would’ve done that” now he’s currently 12th on trending, like I’m so proud of him 💓
Love this Matt
You did a great Job Matt so incredibly proud of u <3
14:32 it did make sense !
you're not boring!! not doing "entertaining" things doesn't make you boring, you're so genuinely funny !!!! also im really excited for you to talk about anxiety, because i suffer from it too <333
i love this video so much i can’t wait to see what he does with this channel :)
Matthew, you are not boring. Not being extroverted is okay, you still have so much to bring.
It’s kinda sad why he thinks he’s a boring person because he doesn’t have Nick and Chris with him. All of the triplets are genuinely entertaining and hilarious individually and as a trio as well. :)  Matt if by any chance ur reading this just know that I love you with my whole heart and you have a hugggggeeee impact on so many people + don’t worry about consistency do whatever you like and what ever you’re comfortable with. you’re genuinely entertaining and super funny. I can’t wait for all your other videos !!!!! <3 :))
i could listen to this guy talk about leather for hours and not get bored. Who's with me??? We love you MATT <3
u arent boring ur fun and chill and its nice to see u on ur own. also this vid was fun and the editing was a vibe.
OMG HI CUTIE
Matty B u shall keep that outro<3
if anything you’re not boring, sounds kind of creepy but i enjoyed every second of this video just by you sitting there and talk about yourself. you’re so chill and calm it felt like we were on a facetime. don’t doubt yourself you’re a really interesting person.
the very last second of this video was my favorite. matt you are very funny and just made my night. i’m glad you’re doing these types of videos and exploring who you are on your own :)
bring the kiss camera for the outro!!
Matt ty that ur trying to do ur best and in this vid ur soul is really shining when you talk , I really enjoyed this video THANK you so much .
It’s so nice that we get to see each of their personalities so much better in their personal channels.matt don’t doubt yourself you are so funny and I really enjoyed this video .keep going
Stop cause you're doubting yourself so much but this whole video was so cute and funny 😭
matt ur literally actually a very interesting person and im very similar to u , i also cope w social anxiety and stuff so im so excited to see more fron YOU! i love ur personality and ima ve here to support u always:) OH AND ALSO i really enjoyed this, like ur genuinely entertaining, u dont have to do crazy shit to be entertaining i liked this video sm
UR EDITING IS FUNNY
The last part of the video caught me so off guard and I just started fucking laughing so hard 💀
Matt your editing is TOO good
U should do a video where u try things and go places u've never been before alone
There’s non”boring” nowadays so don’t worry about that! I can’t wait to see more videos from you matt <3
Matt you’re not boring at all. I loved this video and I’m so glad we get to hear you talk more and know more about you. I’m glad you made this channel and I can’t wait to watch all your future videos. I relate to you a lot especially with the anxiety part and it makes me feel better that you’re open to making videos about it and talking about your experience with it. A lot of people don’t talk about it and it just feels good knowing you want to. Also you’re not boring whatsoever. You’re a very entertaining,chill,and funny person. You can do whatever videos you want to and it would be entertaining. You impact so many people by just being yourself. I can’t wait to see you grow and get to know you more. Also I just want to reassure you that we do get what you’re trying to say. I know you said that people probably don’t knowing what you’re trying to say or talk about but trust me we do. Don’t worry about feeling awkward or weird while filming by yourself, as time goes on you will get more comfortable. I can’t wait to see what videos you put out in the future, and just know that whatever you put out we will love. Whether it’s a more ‘active’ video or sit down video we will love it all. I love hearing you talk and what you have to say. You can ramble on and on and we will always listen. You’re interesting,entertaining,chill,funny, and many more things. We love you Matt ❤️
OMG FOR HIS OUTROS HE SHOULD BRING BACK THE KISSES
DO CLOTHING HAULS
MATT wdym “boring” i enjoyed the whole thing!! Pleas keep doing this!! Love youu❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹
14:13 fr and then ur just like damn that was fun
“Damn i was blowing everything” LMAO😭😭😭😭
11:43 ONGGGG it feels like…clunky???
I loved that you’re like, I’m gonna talk about my anxiety and stuff but then you put the note: “I’m fine, don’t worry”, I’m not doubting that you’re good I’m just saying that is funny (not the anxiety, the way you talked about it)
11:05 mf named all types of jewelry
this was fun to watch honestly went by real fast (in a good way)
I LOVE THE EDITING
Love Nick and Chris, but i really enjoyed hearing Matt talk without getting interrupted. Matt, you‘re not boring at all!!
CLOTHING HAULS PLZ AND OR MOVIE REVIEWS (they don’t have to be like genuine technical just ur thoughts!!) AND OMG FOOD REVIEWS JSUT REVIEWS IN GENERAL??? idk I lost my train of thought
This video is great!! Keep going cause tbh i really enjoy just listening to you talking about diferent stuff...you're not boring, this is a great start to your own journey<333
Video ideas Morning routine/ Night routine Your favorite stuff What i eat in a day Room tour Story times  You´re really entertaining to watch ty for the video! :))
I relate so much to Matt prolly because I'm a middle child too, and that's why he's my fave among the three,  the way you are without your younger and older siblings just hits different, cause your older sibling can always talk anytime he/she want to since their the eldest, while your younger siblings too can say/d9 whatever they want, since he/she is like the baby since their the youngest, but if your the middle child theres not much space for you to talk and all you could really do is just balance and mediate, which is why we prolly think we are boring, probably cause we are not use to speaking our minds and are sometimes uncomfortable being or talking by ourselves, since we are used to having support from our siblings or we just really never had the chance to talk like before, and we kinda would feel left out since it barely happens that others can relate to us since there's not that much middle child.
I want video games!!! Idc if it’s not “expert gameplay” or anything, I just love gaming videos
This was so fricking cute! <3
loved this!! btw matt, you’re my fave of the brothers because of how sweet you are and how relatable you are. please make more videos just chatting like this, and honestly, you don’t need to fix the “work” you said you would have to, because i like this simple and raw version of you!
Matt just remember any content at all that you put out there we will watch and we will all enjoy👏❤️even if it seems boring to you, just know that we will be interested in it and all that matters is what you want to do/post on the internet❤️❤️❤️
The editing Matt did in this video is so funny lmao 😂
I WANNA RUN THROUGH THE SCREEN AND HUG HIM UGHHHHHHHHHHH MATT YOU ARE NOT BORRING PLS I LOVE YOU SO MUCH DONT SAY THAT <3
Love you matt x
noo matt WE LOVE YOU MATT 💚💚
I think that you are a very relatable person and I really enjoyed this video!
I wish he wouldn’t be so down on himself. He doesn’t need to be doing something crazy and big to be entertaining. The real people will be here to learn more about him and be there to support him in becoming a bigger YouTuber. He is so effortlessly funny and entertaining and he doesn’t even realize it. I really like the clothing haul idea and the talk about anxiety because I relate to the anxiety aspect. It just breaks my heart when he talks about how “boring” he is💔😢
love this dude
I love the editor notes ❤️
don’t doubt yourself matt! the video was amazing and can’t wait to see what’s next
For clothing you could do “dressing up as a different aesthetic for every day of the week”
I literally love u sm Matt! Cant wait for more videos 🥳
It makes sense because everyone has different ideas so we’re all inspiring you to do different things you may never thought of!
I personaly find your vlog very peaceful which I like cuz you are in general very peaceful and chill and it does'nt eaqual to boring at all.
Correct me if I’m wrong but I feel like you think nick and Chris make up your personality but that’s not true you might think that way because you might act more excited when they are around but that’s not the case, you are your own person and no one is boring especially not you. Depending who I hangout with it can effect how I act as well it’s not just you, so since you grew up with them you might think of yourself as their shadow (that’s just what it seems when you talked about yourself). But I hope you know you stand out by yourself your not just part of them you are your own person and although your similar doesn’t mean you are the same… no one is exactly the same. I hope you realize that I just think you spend SO much time with them you start to feel like your not a interesting person without them and you are. Your all related but it’s like your best friends and best friends share things in common and so do siblings, but don’t forget you have your own qualities that are separate from them and you can be just as fun without them because that’s still yourself when your with them.

No matt u r not boring at all , I always say to my self that i have a special love for u , u r a totally the type of person that i like the most , and I think i see a lot of things we share together, and im just so glad and so thankful that u made this personal youtube channel which’s gonna let me  know about who is matt and what his social anxiety , i just loved how you setting there and talks about things ,i just find it so cool and calming,I love u so much matt and I hope u always find a reason to smile ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
this video is the best thing ever , it made me happy
the way he helped me understand that anxiety can happen on a daily basis is so fucking shocking to me. ive been struggling with that for quite some time now and i couldn’t understand what i was feeling and the way matt openly talks about anxiety is just so comforting
💖
You are not boring Matt We love you so much ❤️❤️
ngl if u think u are boring juste NO! like u dont understand how u literally saved me. And when u change subject and shit u actually are soooo intertaining and I watch every second of it, luv u❤❤❤
I love this video so much! Thank you for making this video Matt, learning about you personally without you getting interrupted is so incredible and so so interesting. I can't wait to see what you do with your channel and learn more about you Matt! So proud of you Matt. Also incredible job of editing your video, you did an insane job. Lots of love for you!! <33
You’re not boring though. I love your personality and how real you are in this video, saying things what many of us think but are afraid to say out loud. But I’m so curious if you have any coping mechanisms for anxiety
u are not boring you are so inspiring to me and makes my day. i laugh all the time when i watch u guys. i struggle with anxiety like u and i love when u just sit down and talk. Here is a video  request challenges i like when u did the baking challenge.
The way I wish we could have a convo about anxiety bc I 100% understand what you mean and wanna add on & listen to more of what you have to say about your experiences of/ with it
14:31 that absolutely makes sense matt.. I do actually believe everyone has experienced that atleast every once in awhile when they're havin a good talk with someone.. and don't worry about how ppl might view ur vids as, long as ur being urself, enjoying and overcoming ur personal struggles with us, that'd be so cool
matt just take a look and literally any comment on this vid and see how many people genuinely care about you, take ur time !!
matt you listen to me rn, YOU ARE MOST CERTAINLY ARE NOT BORING.🫶
you're not boring :( each of you are amazing individuals.
For some reason I felt more entertained and I’m glad your going to talk about anxiett
I hurt me when he said I’m boring in my own.  I hope this gives him the opportunity to speak for him and help people with anxiety.  Like I have it really bad and he helped me so much thank you Matt!!❤️❤️
anxiety videos yes!!
Don’t call yourself boring
I loved this! Don't doubt yourself, Matt ❤️
It would be cool if you did story times about things from yours and your brothers childhoods and even about recent things that happen to all of you!
IFY, I get really bad driving anxiety too and nobody gets ittt, they swear im being dramatic or I'm trying to get out of running an errand...like no I need to mentally prepare myself or it gets worse
i love this video so much! the editing was so good, i love the little thoughts and stuff. I cant wait to see ur channel grow as well as nick and chris. cant wait for the next one!
Welcome to YouTube!
He’s so cool
So excited to see more stuff from youuu
Matt ur not boring, ur really fucking        Cool

Hi Matt, the video was amazing. I love you so much and I’m so happy to see that you’re happy. You’re really important to me.I’m so thankful that you talk about your anxiety because I have it to and I’m really quiet about it and you make me feel less alone about it. Please never stop making this videos. They make me happy when I’m sad and they make me laugh when I’m crying. I really love you. Thanks for being there always for us

Omg I have the same problem with rings and feeling claustrophobic. Love them but can only wear them for short amounts of time
I loved this video so much! Can’t wait for any content we get from this channel! Would love to see some anxiety videos maybe, but honestly would love any kind of videos you decide to make! Much love Matt! ❤️ only going up from here 🚀
Matt you are not boring, you impact us so much we love watching you and listening to do. i love you <3
LMAO MATT  BLOWING IN EVERYTHING IS HELLA FUNNY
i love how the little subtext scenes are just like the things nick and chris would say if they were there😭🫶🏻
He’s so relaxing and I have no clue why
The pickle answer is so true. Like my step sister drinks pickle juice and I literally gag every time i see it. Like if someone asked me if I wanted a pickle I’d say hell yeah but like NEVERRR DRINK IT EWWW HAHAHHAH
The edit is great dw, the little interludes r fun
Matt, you certainly aren’t boring! This upload made my day so much better and you are hilarious :) Please don’t doubt yourself, you are so entertaining and we are all rooting for you <33  Edit: I’d love to see you do a mukbang and answer this or that questions/ controversial opinions :))
I LOVE THOSE EDITING SKILLS
You are entertaining and we love all the video ideas you mentioned. I’m excited to see what’s coming and that you don’t get interrupted and holding eye contact to the camera I LOVE THAT this gives me the vibes that im sitting with you and it’s definitely on a more personal level… if you know what i mean…..🫶🏻❤️
hey, Matt it’s completely fine to not know what to say at time, it let us some time to get the information of what ur saying + ur not boring bc u don’t have a lot to do or stuff like that dw
13:43 LMAOOOO
I truly enjoyed this video so much~ Your pink word edits had me cracking up lmfao I felt so interactive with them if that makes sense lol (like when they popped up & I read them I would reply to them... ahahah does that make sense??? Or do I sound crazy?? lmfao) ANYWAYS I love this Matt, you did awesome! Can't wait to see what else you post, don't even trip about not posting consistently, you post when you wanna we're gonna love & enjoy them regardless. I am actually very interested in that clothing haul idea, it'll be like a longer version of your "cool clothes I buy" videos on tiktok which I loved so that'll be dope! Oh and the anxiety talks will be hella interesting & informative so totally looking forward to those as well... but remember do what you're comfortable with and take your time. You're doing great! Love ya ♡  ^ I typed way more than I thought, my bad🤦🏻‍♀️
i could listen to him talk for days
13:43 these little things you wrote throughout the video are so funny😭😭
Ur not boring Matt ur pretty real with how ur feeling and I have ADHD and I get anxiety as well so knowing someone like u goes through the same shit and is open to talk bout it is really cool so thank you so much for being a real one lover boy 💛
14:15 yes i understand COMPLETELY
I loved this video so much
You are definitely like a comforting person to me. You relate to me a lot and I hope you keep doing these personal videos. You are giving me Emma Chamberlain vibes and I love it. Please keep doing this 💕🥰
Matt we love you so much please don’t forget that ever <3
You don’t sound like an idiot it’s not trying to entertain people it’s being yourself. Just do whatever you want to do. And I hope you are comfortable with making the videos because if not than you don’t need to that often.
matt you are my favorite person on planet earth. you have the most calming energy and it’s warming to my soul
The only thing i wanna say is that in the group YouTube account you guys have cover the entertaining part but here . Matt here you are your self and thats what matters
I feel like I can really relate to Matt. I feel really bland with out my family, because I’m always with them. I also have like separation issues with them. And I get really bad anxiety as well, and knowing that Matt does as well feels comforting. We love you Matt :)
I love matt so much. I relate to him on so many levels, he’s my comfort person💕
he’s so well spoken aw
matt you’re absolutely not boring, don’t ever think you are. i could listen to you talk all day, you’re an incredibly interesting person as an individual as well, we love you and you’re awesome!! we’re super proud of you.  ps great job at editing!!
dude ur not boring . ur video genuinely made me smile stop doubting ur self man :)))
I love his editing ❤️🤣, I would love to hear more bout you and what u wanna do in the future alone. :)))
We all knew it wasn't going to be a video like one with your brothers but that doesn't matter. It's different but it's yours. Whether you were lost in the beginning and thought you were boring, you did amazing. So many people adore you. This is new and you gotta get used to it but that's fine! I'd love to see this progress and can't wait to see more from you <3 We love you, Matt!!
your actually so entertaining, i’m watching this after school and i’m literally so relaxed and happy after a shit day, i love u matt❤️
you are NOT boring 🫶🏻
I love you Matt :)
omg matt dont ever say your “boring” ever again you aren’t! we love you so much you impact us sm <3 i cannot wait to see u grow as an individual
i love that the lil edited texts are basically what nick and chris would say if they were here
i really like how you want to talk about anxiety, it releases a lot of stigma around it even when you just say that you have it, thank you !!
I loved this video keep doing them, you’ll feel awkward at first but you’ll get used to it I personally love this type of content so just have fun and enjoy love you
Waitttt u should get a podcast i loved this and i like hearing u talk😀
i loved this video!!! i like hearing you talk and u are not boring 🥰
i loved this video matt u r amazing💞 ur editing is sooo funny hahahaha
I would say treat this as a kind of diary/journal were you talk about what's on your mind atm. People really want to listen to what you have to say. I can't speak for everyone, but that's how I feel:) I woud definitely watch that kind of videos.
matt this was such a good first video! i know exactly what you mean by that you remember good memories when someone brings up something you didn’t remember. also you are so not boring, i loved hearing you speak on your own and not be interrupted  and hear what you have to say. keep going💕💕 love you.
Matt attacked me with that pickle juice comment😭
a day in your life sounds good matt try it
matt you're not boring at all i promise <33
next time you drive alone you film and talk everything you need to talk so you don’t feel alone
the way that i understand what you mean with being boring but having a personality is kinda weird
Matt your not "boring"! Your so unique and funny in your own ways and that's why we love you so much I'm so excited to see what your  gonna post on this account and I think I'm speaking for everybody else to we would love for you to talk about your anxiety and your mental health like you said it's really not spoken enough around the YouTube platform don't rush on these videos do it whenever you feel like we love you Soooo much ❤️❤️
It didn’t sound as depressing as you think it did, this was fun I think you should keep going ❤
Matt has genuinely already helped me so much with my anxiety and feeling more comfortable about it and not a freak. He’s helped me open up more about it and I really appreciate him for that and also just making me laugh in videos ❤️
You did so good! I'm so proud <3
Its so sad when he says he’s boring because he is so funny and i love listening to him so much. He is literally the opposite of boring and him talking about his anxiety and stuff makes me feel safe
I LOVED THIS SM MATT
I love his comments here and there, he doesn’t really acknowledge how funny he really is
pls do fortnite vids 😩😩🫶
i love this video Matthew :) i am so happy that you posted 😻
you're amazing, loved watching your video 🙏
also have to mention that it feels way more intimate when u do a video on ur own. it feels like we’re just having a conversation and i really appreciate that. ur the best <3
You’re doing so good Matt!! Don’t discourage yourself, you did so well and we all can’t wait to see you grow <33
I love seeing you, now getting one on one content I love it 😊🥺
You’re not boring. You’re fine :) we love you either way, and your personality doesn’t make you any less entertaining
matt we love you so much <3
i love u matt and i’m so so happy ur doing ur own thing!! u mean so much to me and millions of others, we just want to see you be happy whatever ur doing. this video alone just made my day so much better, u’ll have no idea how much it means to me. i can relate to you waaay too much maybe that’s why. anywayy love u and so proud of u. 🖤
not he’s saying he’s “so boring”, Matt listen if you’re boring I wouldn’t even be here so yeah
slayed the house boots down matthew <3
it hurts that he thinks he’s boring but the amount of times i laughed during this video❤️ love him so much❤️
You mean so much to us Matt, dont ever say you’re boring cause you and your brothers have made thousands of people’s lives 100x more better, you were the one to make us smile when were in our bad days and you never fail to make us laugh :) We love you more than you know
i feel the same way about the rings. also with necklaces i feel claustrophobic for some reason. thought it was just me.
it breaks my heart seeing matt saying he’s boring he’s one of the most entertaining people ever i love him so much and i bet most of you do to i hope he knows it we love you matt and ur amazing <3
totally get the feeling of attachment issues and such cause i have a twin sister and im ALWAYS around her. i’d also love watching the anxiety videos cause it’s nice hearing about how it feels in someone else’s perspective!! but it’s great seeing you guys branch out into your own personal content!!! can’t wait to see more!! ALSO THE EDITING WAS REALLY GOOD AND FUNNY!!
honestly matt there’s no need to worry about being “boring”. nowadays being entertaining is any and everything. this was very entertaining and calming to watch. just bcs you’re not laughing all the time doesn’t mean it’s not entertaining you’re very interesting person alone and with your brothers<3 hope you know you’re amazing, we’d love to watch anything at all<33
Matt, all I wanna say is that whenever I have a bad day or a good day as well I just watch you and your brothers' videos and you guys make me feel like I'm chatting with my friends and having fun with them. I can really say that you guys make me feel comfortable. Also I'm really excited for your channel because I'm sure you're gonna learn a lot throughout this journey and it's gonna help you a lot with your life as well. You're doing really well, love ya!<3
2:00 he saw the dude walking behind in the mirror and locked the door
that video was great and so real, loved it matt
those once a month videos can just be little life updates for us and you to see yourself grow as a person :)

Drive through tase testing different fries 🍟
I can't he's literally the sweetest.
The way I was smiling through the whole video made me realize that it is okay to have anxiety because I am not alone. Matt don’t ever say you’re boring because you’re not , you’ve been my comfort for the past few months & you’ve put endless smiles on my face so for that I say thank you❤️! Your videos are gonna be amazing just like you ! I’m so proud of you for doing this ❤️ Keep shining Matt ❤️
I LOVE this video it’s so chill and it gives comfort ❤❤❤

Proud of you for doing this, you need a stop doubting yourself you arent boring at all, and listening to this was really comforting, you talking about your anxiety is you opening up and it makes me feel better knowing that it's not just me struggling, please continue these, again im super proud of you for starting your own channel this was great! <3
Dude, I'm so happy this showed up in my recommended! Definitely excited to see when you go with individual content, and it's very refreshing to see someone so open about their anxiety :)) Keep doing you
i loved this vid!!
the way i can relate to matt.. i feel you matt especially the part where you can't be alone. my brother is my best friend and he's the only sibling that i have. going out without him is just weird for me like sometimes i do feel anxiety kicking in because i feel like i can't breathe properly and people are like lowkey judging me, making me overthinking and shits. i do have some attachment issues too which i don't realized it. matt, i'm so glad that you make ur own channel & decided to share the things that you always feel. you're literally like my safe space & pls don't say you're boring because you are not boring. i really like these kind of videos so pls continue doing what you are doing now, matt.
tbh as a person with two sisters the attachment issues thing is true 😭
i love you sm we love you and we think ur entertaining:))

Matt gives me Emma chamberlain vibes
i’ve never had anyone else to relate my anxiety with, when u were talking abt using the washroom i couldn’t relate more. i over think every little thing to the point were i start panicking and it is so frustrating.  AND PLS DO VIDEO GAMES CLOTHING HAULS AND ANXIETY TALKS
I LOVE IT MATT AND THE LITTLE CUT CLIPS WITH THE TEXT ON THE SCREEN V GOOD VIDEO can't wait to see more!!

Matt's so worried about trying to be entertaining but he doesn't need to, He IS entertaining.
the editing is so good !
I would LOVE video gaming videos 😫😫😫
Matt you did extraordinary considering it's your first vid and you're alone!!!!
he's doubting himself frequently but matt you're such an amazing individual i can hear you talk for an hour or more without getting bored & obviously you're not a boring person matt <3 you're good to go !! i cant wait to see more of your personal video i love you im so proud of you
idk why you say you are boring please keep with this videos I find you really interesting and with a deep mindset, mixing it with humor. LOVE IT MATT !!
The elevator music😭😭
you can make videos talking like deep talks and some ideas you have been thinking etc
u should play roblox!
you are too rough with yourself literally I enjoyed it a looottt
Maybe for ideas, you could do hauls or something like that! Q&As, storytimes, etc.
"I have attachment issues to nick and chris." That made me so sad ongg ):
You’re so funny pls keep doing these videos!!
MATT THIS VIDEO WAS GOOD! i promise you this put smiles on so many peoples faces
I loved this video and I love you sm Matt<3
BIG BAD B MAKES AN ENTRANCE
I actually throughouly enjoyed this video and was definitely entertained! Don’t doubt yourself Matt! You’re doing great ! I personally believe we’d love anything you’d upload as you’re a very relatable person.Also the editing was hilarious 💀💀💀 Much love ❤️❤️
i’m so proud of Matt, he’s accomplished so much and i love seeing him and the others grow together and individually and i just know this channel is gonna be a safe space for so many people. ❤️❤️

I’m genuinely entertained by you talking
Pee in the sink lmao 😂

I already love it
i love u matt
I love the small pick cuts once in a while hahahahahaha

15:06 LMAO
it's so nice to hear Matt expressing his thoughts and feelings on his first video. this is not at all boring like he's literally so awesome and entertaining. protect him at all cost :>>
ngl this is the best video i’ve ever watched istg
matt gives me emma chamberlain vibes, he’s relateable and even though he might think he needs to be doing something to be entertaining, just him talking about his thoughts and feelings is comforting and relatable. those type of videos are my favorite so i think anything can be entertaining and engaging not just going out and doing something <3
the way i can relate to lots of stuffs u said. thank u for this video matt <3
11:25 ik whatchu mean!!! rings are so cool but i hate wearing them for long periods of time
React to edits of urself omg there's so many
WE ARE SO PROUD OF YOU MATT !!!
MATT YOURE NOT BORING AT ALL THAT PART MADE ME SAD OML
So proud of Matt being able to do this video! This video was so interesting and the editing in this video was everything! Very excited to see anxiety talks because I my shelf struggle so much with social anxiety and for stupid dumb things that shouldn’t need anxiety and being able to get advice would be great! One last thing don’t doubt your shelf you are amazing and once you put your mind into something you’re gonna accomplish it. Put context that you wanna put out, everyone as there own preference on what they want to watch and there’s people that will love your type of content no doubt to it. So thrilled to see what you have next for us!!! 💗
this video saved my day
I love this, “entertaining” or not I love watching you like this
Matt, you did a good job! Proud of you!
Mr. Bernard I absolutely loved this please do not doubt you self I love you
Do you guys believe in fate and luck stone?? Love your  videos so much!!!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️ (Sorry about the English)
This was great mattt!!
I definitely get that memory feeling. That shit hits when it’s a childhood memory too
You slayed matt
this was so refreshing to watch i acc enjoyed this sm and i cannot wait to watch more on your own time ofc but i am so happy you decided to pull through w this channel
literally me and matt are so alike and its  really refreshing to having someone publicly talk ab anxiety and being more of the quiet one. honestly so excited for more videos
Omg Matt this was such a nice video,It's different from the rest of the male YouTubers' videos,I don't know how, but I think you have your own vibes and it’s different from anyone else.  Don't be hard on yourself,You don't need to do long videos. Some clips will be enough,don’t follow anyone's style,find yours. Love you and thank you for doing this video❤️
Questions  for the next video⬇️ *what do you think about your hair cut and your brothers hair cut?
i'd love to see you play games idc if ur good at them or not but i think seeing you play elden ring or genshin impact would be great !!
Matthew bestie you killed this
you should play the cello for us
2:15 ur so precious. thank u for this
Awww matt this is wonderful!!!
<3
i loved this video!! u don’t need to change anything. can’t wait for the next one <3
Matt please keep doing vids like this and talking about your anxiety and mental health and how you deal with it and we can deal with it
99k already! i’m so proud of him
I'd love if you did a anxiety talk video
Matt, you truly are an amazing person dont ever doubt yourself or call yourself boring. You’re a very fun and entertaining person to watch and this is definitely something I could get used to. I wanted to thank you for helping me deal with my anxiety and just making me know that I wasn’t alone. Neither are you. Love you <3
I really liked your video!!!And Matt you're definitely not boring:)
matt!!! i absolutely loved this! i am so excited to see this channel grow. i love how open you are about anxiety, it makes so many people feel heard. i struggle with anxiety as well, and you’ve made me feel okay about it. you are so far from boring, this was so calming! can’t wait to watch more and i’m so proud of you! <3
I don’t knowwwww sounded pretty pick me to me
this is absolutely amazing matt i am so proud of you and what you have become on your own and with nick and chris. i can tell ur gonna do so well and this will be such a good experience for you! we love you❤️❤️
oh my god yes... Matt sharing about anxiety will definitely help so many people who are currently struggling with it as well including myself
this video is literally everything to me. matt is just an amazing person and im so glad to see him open up about his anxiety, he make me feel less bad about myself and not to worry about it, i enjoyed the video so much i hope he make more videos of him talking, he's calm.
Matt: “… you don’t have two siblings”  Me: has two siblings 🫡
I wasn’t expecting the editing to be so funny because it’s so blunt lol
love you kid🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼
Believe us, whatever you put out for us to watch we will enjoy!! Your an amazing person and definitely not boring :) can’t wait for future uploads!
Matt is definetly not boring at all.  definitely more entertaining than he thinks
Loved the editing
this is how I feel about my own content I struggle so hard because so I feel like I have nothing to talk  about 😭😭 but you got this fr!!!
Matt you have truly became my safe place, my anxiety and panic had been going down since I met you, you just have brought a lot of good things in my life and you don’t even know I exist. Thanks for the support, it’s a mutual thing
matt you should do some pranks on your brothers
I love this!!!
I really appreciate you talking about your mental health. I have been really struggling with mine recently so it means a lot
Matt is such a chello guy tho
14:10 i get it
I love listening to you talk. You’re not boring, just keep doing it and I’ll keep watching you
I love how it's a 50/50 chance whether his outros are kissing the camera or that weird bird screech he does.  =D  I'm pretty sure the only reason their mom had triplets was so that 2 could eat while the other 1 talked.  😂  It's so interesting to see how different Matt is when he actually has to 'fill the space' and not have any downtime while the others were speaking or interrupting him.  Regardless of what topic he chooses, I feel like it's a good idea to have a separate channel where he can explore his own space and not worry about having to bounce off the other two. Might give him a different perspective and ideas for their main channel.
Matt story time on panera bread lady
Matt, you gotta bring back kissing the camera for the personal channels outro
you’re far from boring. you don’t have to go out of your way to be entertaining because we like you for who you are :) trust me, many people find happiness and peace watching videos of you being you. you bring smiles to thousands of faces. as long as you’re happy with what you post that’s all that matters <3!
aww he's so sweet and precious❤
I’m so late and I’m so mad for that because I couldn’t find his acc throughout the links and it wouldn’t appear when I searched it up but anyways this is so amazing I love Matt so much and I hate how he still feel slike he’s not enough because he is.
When Matt talked about his anxiety on the cuffboys channel described my anxiety perfectly so I would really love to hear him talk about it more
GAMING!YEAH!
I honestly feel like I’ve never connected more with a person. With like his body language to his anxiety… omg this’ll be so cool
am i the only one that thinks it looks like he has a black eye? in his right eye
i can relate to matt a lot. when he was talking about driving alone, anxiety, attachment issues, IT MADE ME FEEL SO COMFORTABLE
14:16 yesss Omg i feel so happy when that happens
omg i heard mcdonald’s has a frozen dr pepper?? if they have it at yours do a little review also you could talk abt your gaming and other things your passionate about i’d love to see it:))
Nice vid Matt! 😎
Matt you are too cute I love you
Matt slandering himself for 18 minutes 💀
matt you are so comforting, i loved this video so much stop doubting yourself you did amazing!! also the editing is a 10/10
you’re so a,saint and talented matt, im so happy that you have your own personal youtube channel to share your own thoughts. of course  sing with nick and chris is amazing but it’s so comforting to hear your voice alone. tha m you for being so open with all of us and making us feel accepted. ❤️ can’t wait for the content :)
matt bro dude dawg. this was an incredible first alone video. your the most precious.
i luv u matt u make me so happy<33
MATTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
matt, you did great in this video. you've helped me so much with my anxiety. you don't need to be loud or obnoxious to be entertaining, you always say the perfect things to make us laugh. we love you for you, not the expectation. thank you for always making me laugh <3.
I'm so proud of you
as soon as i started following the sturniolo triplets i felt an instant connection to matt. i struggle with severe anxiety myself and i completely agree with the fact that very few people talk about it. matt’s openess about the topic brings me so much comfort and makes me feel like i’m apart of a community that i can relate with without being uncomfortable or an outsider.
I understand what’s it’s like having like blank brain farts and just can’t think of anything else to talk ab. I sometimes think I’m boring for that but I feel that is me trying to please ppl and not be completely myself.
i love ur videos so much matt! don’t doubt urself ur amazing keep up the good work!!
anyways i’m really proud of you stepping out of your comfort zone & posting on social media without your brothers 💚 baby steps are just as important as big steps !!!! love you always
Personally I enjoyed this video I’m okay with every idea you mentioned and just talks will be dming if I think of another idea!!
alsooooo i struggle with really bad anxiety so any videos of you talking about your coping mechanisms (how you handle having anxiety & how you manage to calm yourself down a little bit) will be very appreciated because i have yet to find a form of coping that works for me !! especially anxiety revolved around social situations & driving !!! mostly driving - i literally HATE driving because of my anxiety around it & i really would love if you could dive into it a little bit (only if you’re comfortable) 💚
Ah ofc we needed the scream
Ngl the editing, as simple as it was, was actually hilarious like I’d chuckle every time you’d comment as editor that was real funny 💀
pause i fully agree with you’re pickle argument like i’ll have one if it’s there but drinking the juice.. hell nah that’s enough lmao
I noticed that we both get anxious about being anxious like I always say “I’m not depressed or anything” and attempt to explain myself and it results in me rethinking that moment over and over again :,) GOOD JOB ON YOUR FIRST VIDEO BY YOURSELFFF IT WAS SO GOOD
I literally love you so much, i really just want to hug you
i truly believe anything you post on this channel will be throughly appreciated & supported 💚 you doubt yourself & don’t believe that you are entertaining without your brothers but i promise you that anyone who follows this personal channel followed it for a reason; we love & support you & your youtube adventure & we can to help you grow your confidence around the concept of being a little less attached to the people around you :))
I love how relatable Matt is and how comfortable he is with sharing the stuff he does honestly makes me feel not so alone 😊
your editing is sooo good I love it and ALSO you're not boring you personality is the best <3
This video made me so happy. I love him so much, we need to protect him at all costs!!!
You are doing a great job doing this by yourself!!! So excited for more content!!! Make the content you want to do and create stuff that is fun for you!!!
I like the car videos vlogs not very strong opinion but I really like the alone car video
You guys are my biggest idol! I love all your videos even or the account with all of you! I followed you on tiktok too your shared account and all of you alone, (don’t think I’m a creep please I just love all of you!)
5:41 it's ok same here
wait where can i find the other personal channels y’all entertaining asf
matt i promise you, you are more than your anxiety. i know it feels a like a big weight that clouds over your life, but you truly are worth more than what your anxiety tells you. you are so entertaining. you aren’t ‘boring’ to us, you are relatable, and that’s what makes so many people drawn to you. im so proud of you
matt we’re literally the same person wtf
i loved this video so much. <3
I love this SO much 🦦❤️
you did this so well. i really enjoyed the whole video. love u so much n i’m so proud of u 💌
The scream at the end 😂 I was expecting a kiss but that’s adorable too 💀
Clothing hauls sounds really fun.  I would definitely watch anxiety talk vids Loving the first video go eat those snacks
Ok but I would actually love to see a day in the life I think that would be rly cool
This was a great first video! You need to give yourself a lot more credit on your entertaining skills. You are so genuine and have a great personality. I can’t wait for more videos you may post and I know they are going to be amazing!
My beloved Matt you are so amazing you are doing so good with what your doing rn I love you so much for mentioning anxiety you are so relatable and I love that you are so out about your anxiety and thank you so much through my journey with anxiety I love you so much<3333
you should make style/outfit videos bc your style is elite
I loved this video!
bro my heart 🥹 love the personal matt content, he’s so real and genuine about everything. keep doin u bro 🤍
LMFAOOOOO THE OUTRO I CNAT
matt i could sit and watch you talk for hours. loved this video :,) def need more from you !!!
He shouldn’t feel like he’s boring this video was really good and he’s the most wholesome and inspiring person i watch and him talking about how bad anxiety is makes anxiety easier for us we love you so much and you’re perfect the way you are
luv u king ❤
it's okay matt, you can talk whatever you want here. you will never be boring to us 💗
we love you!!!
most i’ve ever heard matt talk and i’m living for it
for all your personal channels you guys should have a different Young Pleit song as the intro and outro
thank you for wanting to talk about anxiety. it means so much for people i look up too actually be real🤍
I just want to let you know that you inspire me so much! Ever since I started watching you, Nick, and Chris's YouTube channel, I've been happier and I've laughed more frequently every day from your videos on YouTube and TikTok! You've specifically taught me that just because I have high anxiety and depression, that doesn't mean I'm a bad person and I can still accomplish what I set my mind to. Sorry, this is so cheesy, haha! I have an idea for a video on this channel, if you need it or would like one. Testing/reviewing fidget toys for anxiety. Like you, I've had anxiety my entire life and I have used my fair share of fidget toys and I'd love to hear your opinion on some of them and just see you have fun with them, if that's something you're interested in! Ah, I'm so sorry, I'm writing an essay! Congrats on making your first video on this channel! ❤🤗
I love him! I loved being able to actually listen to what he had to say and not get interrupted! He puts himself down so much but this video was great! Hope we can all make him feel more confident 💙
You should do storytimes
matthew you slayed tbh
you guys should do different views of 24 hours without your brothers on each of your personal channels
you did rlly well matt this really fits you if that makes sense
I really enjoyed the video plss do  it more after you really make me happy I was crying now am smiling but how do you get rid of  Anxiety  I can't stop biting  My nails I'm having Now severe Anxiety
you’re definitely NOT boring
wowww your first video on my bday I won't forget this. im rooting for you. I never thought you would do this lol this is crazy! you say that you're feeling plain without your brothers but I promise you, its very refreshing to see chill people like you on this platform.. just go all out. you are the one that we all are looking at to see more from so here it is!🤠👍🏾
We love you so much Matt🤍
matt you’re so comforting, i have so many similarities to you and i feel so many of the things you feel. you’re such a sweet soul <3
you make me so happy
You are so interesting and entertaining never worry about being boring. You are amazing and impact so many people! Love u so much!
Matt, you mean the absolute world to me. You are so wholesome and loving and caring. I wish you saw yourself the way all of your fans see you. We absolutely adore you and wish you nothing but the best <3
the pickle thing was SO FUNNY
it may make you uncomfortable and i understand if you don’t want to do it, but i think it would be entertaining if you reacted to fan edits:)
i would love to hear how you deal with being an influencer with mental illnesses!
maybe this is me being dumb. but going out once a month by yourself with out nick and chris can help with your anxiety, or slowly introduce it into the world. you could vlog your day out and learn things from other people and what they do. that’s just me tho.
matt is so down to earth. love him so much
We are here for you and we’re proud of you
so proud of you matt. this brought me so much comfort 🤍 heres to the future, wishing you all the success in the world
I liked all ideas
I have cosmetology school right after school and get out until 7:40 pm. With this video, it was like a sit down and one on one when I'm eating dinner 😭
Am her just for you
i love u matttttttttt♥️💜💛💚🧡
matt i don’t think you know how happy this video made me
When you were talking abt the memory thing I totally UNDERSTAND best feeling!!
Do more pls 🙏 I love this plss
please don't compare yourself to anyone else, especially nick and chris. not one of you guys is "funnier" or "more entertaining" than the others. yes, i agree that you do bounce off each other and it is extremely entertaining when you film videos together but this video was one of my favourite videos that i've ever watched of you matt. you doubt yourself a lot which i get because it is a package deal with anxiety but there is no need for it. everyone is boring at times. that doesn't make you a boring person. it just makes you human. you really do inspire people matt and i hope you know that car videos wouldn't be the same without you, just like they wouldn't be the same with nick or chris.
This is the longest time i've heard matt talk. And i'm lovin it. Anyway, sending love from Philippines 🤎
matt is so satisfying to watch, love you matt !!
luv the outro 😭 but yea i think matt is totally capable of putting out great content by himself and im excited to see him grow as he posts more of these vids by himself!!
matt we understand that you don't know what to do because you don't think you'll be entertaining enough, you being "entertaining" isn't what we care about, we will watch your videos because it's YOU. same thing goes for chris & nick<33 i hope u understand what i mean.
2:00 micheal myers walking in the back🚶‍♂️
hearing u talk ab urself literally makes me wanna cry, u are not boring, u are not bland, you are amazing on ur own. i really enjoyed this video and didn’t get bored once. TALK ABOUT YOURSELF BETTER!!! please before u break my heart

Matt has Nick's face and Chris's voice and its tripping me out LOL
you’re literally an angel matt, pls keep making personal videos. you’re so loved 🤍
we love you matt
I love how he always bring up nick and Chris not being here,he truly loves and cares for them so much,I do notice that he is very comfortable around them.💗 (Matt your not boring We Love You!!)

Hello Matt omggg
Omgg my fav triplet
The way i saw this video , subscribed, liked and turned on the post notifications in one breath without even watching the video.  I love him so much.
Love that u feel like starting this channel helps u grow! And we absolutely LOVE hearing u talk and learning more about u 🥰
don’t get me wrong i love watching all three of them together but i can already tell imma love this account, just something about him being able to express himself just makes me happy.
Dont worry Matt this Is an amazing video :) ur voice is so soothing and ur videos are perfect. Ur no where near boring
Matt you are not boring at all even if you sat there  talking about the most random stuff or just sat there for 30 minutes without saying a word people would sit there and just watch you, you bring so much joy and comfort to everyone me included you truly are such a wonderful person. I love you so much and thank you for being you.
For your first video you did great don’t get down on yourself even without Chris and nick you were very entertaining I love you so much ♥️
u are the best can't wait for more videosssss
Dude you are so funny don’t even 😭
While watching these I feel like I’m just listening to a friend. It’s refreshing. Love you Matt <3
te amo matt sos lo mas tierno q hay
finally i can hear him talk
I feel like we're very similar because i'm a really chill and not so talkative person, and this it's honestly very comforting and enjoyable for me.  makes me feel kind of understood, idk if that's the best way to describe it but yea. i love ur content and the way you are. u got this matt !!!
Can't wait to grow with you! Super excited for the future. Sending appreciation from SA💖🇿🇦
you are so sweet. this was very entertaining, you’re not boring. you also dont sound like an idiot and what you say makes sense!!! i feel incoherent a lot too but dont worry you’re good
You are not boring. You bring happiness to many people, and make peoples day all the time. We love you 💕
the ending was a jumpscare
< matt 3
I LOVE THIS I LOVE YOU
MATTT!! I freaking love you, can’t wait to start this new YouTube journey with you!! Your anxiety isn’t your personality you will do great at this and I believe that you will grow throughout the years of having your channel, I love you and what you do with your brothers is amazing and makes peoples day, don’t doubt yourself. 🫶🏻🫶🏻
I love that you want to talk about anxiety it’s is a very breezed over topic but it’s really important
as someone with crippling anxiety i appreciate you
Matt is so underrated, all of my favorite moments from the triplet videos are shit he has said, such an amazing person
relatable king 👑 you are amazing!! you are not boring at all! even so, being boring sometimes is absolutely ok!! this whole week I ate, slept, and woke up at 2 p.m. regularly..it kinda do be like dat sometimes
Matt you literally did so good on this. I’m proud of u
Matt ur doing amazing and I promise you are absolutely no where near boring you're actually quite interesting 😌
awh matt this is so good
comfort video
You put too much weight on your shoulders, this is only your first video on this account so it’s not going to be as good as you expect it to. Youre not boring you just haven’t found a comfortable flow for yourself, it’ll come to you, you just gotta give yourself time to figure it out and not put too much pressure cause it’ll only make you more stressed. It’s a learning process and we really enjoy learning more about you especially those who relate, coming from someone who has 3 siblings and the same struggles as you :,) Give yourself time and just go with the flow, this video was entertaining to watch even if you think otherwise
Story time about Panera lady please!!!
he’s the sweetest istg Matt I love you
i loved this matt
I really enjoyed watching this. It's cool to be able to get to hear and see how you act individually and as you said it could help you grow. I'm so proud of you for editing and filming by yourself, it would have been a challenge. You are definitely entertaining and funny in this. Don't underestimate yourself.
First of all, I don’t think you are boring. You don’t always have to be super entertaining on this channel. Sometimes I like just sitting back and watching lay back videos like this because it feels like we are just hanging out with each other. ☺️ also, I get the whole anxiety thing with small things… I know I have anxiety even though I was never actually diagnosed with it and it’s not to a point where it effects my day to much but I still know it’s there. Anyways, I love you and can’t wait to see more of your personality come out individually. Don’t stress about this channel and just have fun with it because that’s how you are going to enjoy it 💙
Matt u should keep going this vid is so fucking good and u r amazing the way you are i love u and i wil always do we all love u and support u if u r alone we will support u if u r with ur brothers we will support u all remember you're the best <3
matthew. stop being so hard on yourself. you’re not boring. i enjoyed this video so much and hearing you talk about everything from your point of view. i feel like we all got to know you so much better from seeing your humor through the way you edit, and also getting on a real level with us. love you, keep being you, you dont need to change for anything or anyone.
please bring back the camera kisses for the outro!!!!!!!
matt is a king and i loved the way u edited this :) keep doing you
I LOVE THE EDITING STYLE OMF
I don’t think you’re “boring”, you don’t have to be shouting and screaming and telling jokes to be “entertaining” i for one really enjoy videos like this which are just heart to heart talks, i have anxiety too and i really enjoy watching people who are like me too. i honestly think you’d be great at video game videos and you don’t have to be really good at games to be able to make videos out of it tbh. Anyway i really enjoyed this video keep it up ily❤️
I was waiting for that one scream at the end. best video on the entire Internet access.
DO A CLOTHING HAUL
Love the scream at the end
i love how open and comfortable you are about your mental health!!! im sure this channel will be so great and entertaining and help you find yourself better. i loved this video and can’t wait for more!!
Wow this feels weird but we’re ready to get started
Matt if you EVER call your self boring again I will literally start spamming you that you aren’t,I just know you’re a fun person alone you’re literally amazing,it’s fine to be nervous about having your first video alone,literally 5 seconds in and I’m already entertained,ily <3
Idk if you are gonna see this, but you are wonderful I hope to more videos of you in the future. And to get to know you a little more like what are your favorite TV shows, etc. Thanks for being you.
i love you so fucking much matt. your family literally saved my life. thank you so much for being my favorite human alive.🫶
matt is the best ever
matt you are such a special person and very interesting!! and if you really are aiming for once a month maybe they can be just updates on how you are !! i think a lot of us would enjoy hearing you rant, vent, etc ❤️❤️ ty for the video!
i appreciate you so much for talking about your anxiety so freely. it really helps others talk about there’s and open up about it. you’re also so inspiring and entertaining and NEVER say you are boring. just bc you aren’t as crazy as your brothers, doesn’t mean you don’t have your own spark. your personality is far from boring and your such an interesting person. I am excited to see more content/get to know you more on this channel.
your literally the coolest human
I admire you so much Matt and love seeing your growth in this vid <3 Also I loved getting to just hear you speak freely and THE EDITINGG I LOVE IT AHABSMDKS
Omg i love this❤️
i love him so much oh my god I’m so proud of him <3
I completely understood the whole someone mentioning a memory thing and it brings back a memory you almost forgot and the good times that went along with it. Also laughed so hard when you said “internet… why did I say it like that” love this video, looking forward to more!!
10/10 editing! nice first video matty b :)
He is so sweet. I CANT!! Matt you go this we are all here for you!!
you are so much more capable than you realize. i really enjoyed just hearing you talk. you aren’t boring at all. we care about what you have to say.
I’m honestly so glad that you are so open with ur anxiety. I’ve been struggling with severe anxiety so much my whole life but especially these past few years and to hear someone else talk about it who feels the same way is so comforting and beyond helpful. It’s gotten to the point where I’m debating going to my senior graduation bc of how anxious and sick I feel in social settings. Also please remember that you are literally not boring and our anxiety is not a reflection of us or our personality. It’s just something that we happen to have and can take over sometimes:) Thanks matt!
i absolutely LOVE seeing everyone’s comments saying how he isn’t boring bc it’s just so true. he doesn’t need to be super loud and extroverted like nick and chris often are to be “entertaining” bc so many of us could sit here for 3 hours listening to matt talk about something that he wants to share and we would listen front and centre. as someone who has suffered with 3 types of anxiety since the age of 12, i understand it plays a huge role in self-doubt and feeling out of place in ur own skin but matt u are doing fucking amazing!! beyond proud of u <33
self confidence! i think you are too hard on yourself, i love off topic rants and  semi "boring vids" that you may find useless but many love<3
wow, this was just a great video. he kind of makes me feel similar to how emma chamberlain does; a calming, friendly presence of someone who you are very faithful wouldn't judge you if they knew you. he is so attentive & calm. he's better at this than he gives himself credit for.
honestly loved this video so much, your editing is literally everything. i was laughing sm and i rlly like the ideas u have planned for future vids. you totally got this and i’m excited for what else u accomplish
the pink comments had me dying 😂
so mad at myself for not being on my phone when this came out, that sounds really bad lmao but i wanted to see this right away so now i am sad
Literally love to hear him talk for a prolonged time he’s very intelligent and interesting alone but sometimes his personality gets over shadowed so I’m very glad he’s doing this also the editing is great!
Yes PLEASE anxiety talk vids ‼️❤️
matt you're sooooooo precious, I already love the channel!! (btw, I really love the gameplays videos idea )
Pls make more videos you are so awesome and really funny
Also I feel like you could still do individual vlogs with Nick and Chris but it would just be you filming and your commentary and stuff…? Idk if that makes sense lol. Just an idea
5:33 bro that made so much sense now, oml, that's sooo me
the ring claustrophobia thing is literally me. I try to wear rings all day and end up feeling like trapped with them on and claustrophobic so i end up always taking them off in the space of like 2 hours.
we already love you SO much, but we still don't know tons about you-so this channel is great, Matt! please don't think it’s boring or not entertaining because it’s quite literally the opposite❤️ i adore you all but i definitely feel that when it comes down to it, you are the most relatable triplet. it’s always relieving to see how true and humble you are. i am so excited to learn more about each of you and your original thoughts!! 💞💞💞
I have the same thing with rings bc of my adhd, it makes me feel overstimulated
You did a great job on your first video. It is nice and entertaining to see you in this environment. You don’t need to doubt yourself; you are not boring. You are MATTHEW BERNARD STURNIOLO (aka lover boy) 😂 but seriously, you did great!
the way he went out of his comfort zone to go out driving by himself, sit in his car by himself and just talk just so we are entertained and can get to know him as an individual! i have so much respect for the triplets cause they just wanna entertain us and make people happy so they will go out of their way and comfort zone just to do so🤍🤍
ex cello players unite
“Everyone got a little mental health issue” lmao relatable
i love how you’re like “i’m boring” and “i dont even know what to post” but ur the first out of three to even post on this 💀     edit: just wanted to say you are not boring and you don’t need your brothers to be interesting! you are you and you are amazing too! (wow i’m dr seuss) :)
you are absolutely amazing, don't you ever think that you are boring. We all love you very much. <3
don’t worry about being boring, there’s no such thing. we’ll enjoy your videos because it’s you. can’t wait to see more. 👍🏽
You arent boring. This video is so comforting and its great to hear you talk to the camera by yourself. I hope you know how many peoples lives you have positively impacted by just being yourself on camera with your brothers and without. You are amazing, genuine, and always bring smiles to everyones faces. Loved the video!! Can't wait to see your next one whenever it comes out :DD
You’re not at all an idiot nor boring, in fact I (And many others as proved in the comment section) think quite the contrary. Your very entertaining! I love sit-down open, genuine, honest chat videos like this! And I really appreciate you talking about what you have with us. <3 You seem like a really kind, funny, down to earth person. 🧚🏻‍♀️ We love to see it. 👏🏻 I hope you are doing okay. 💜
i’m really excited for u to make your own content, talking about your mental health means so much to so many of us and i’m so glad you can be transparent with us
Matt, I admire your dedication. You may not have known what to do or felt out of place, but you still did it. You did an amazing job. I promise you that you are far from boring. Stop doubting yourself, you are doing great❤️
ily matt so excited for this channel and the anxiety talks means a lot to me so excited
PLEASE play the impossible game in a video. It’s so funny when people play it and get frustrated lol
WE love you, im so excited for the next video even tho  its gonna be probably in a month but im gonna be here waiting🥰
AHHHH MAJOR SLAY
We love calm/setting and just talking
matt is the exact opposite of boring. watching him makes me so excited :)
Little did he know that he is entertaining/ appealing to see just talking without doing anything
This is the longest I’ve ever seen him talk , glad you all have started your own channels
stop doubting yourself so much 😭 we’re all here cause we love you and have fun with you. Just enjoy yourself, post whenever you want to, and be nicer to yourself. You’re super funny and exciting to watch
You aren’t bland at all!! You are very genuine and I enjoyed getting to know you personally more:)
i just love hearing matt talk, he’s so soothing and comforting 😭 i could honestly just listen to him talk for hours
this is going to be a good process to find yourself , and we love it !!!!!!!!!! :)<3
Damn I always thought Nick was like the triplet that doesn't look that alike from the others and very differential... but GOD I WAS COMPLETELY WRONG! While watching this video, many times I thought I was actually watching Nick instead of Matt without realizing XD... kinda creepy feelings whenever i remembered myself is actually Matt.
i like all of the ideas
everyone is writing paragraphs but i just wanted to say i’m as tall as matt but wtv 😭😻
thank you for being open with us. I hope that this personal channel gives us a better glimpse into who you really are. it’ll be great to see you grow as an individual on your own channel. much love 🫂.
matt dude ur honestly so amazing. like you talking about anxiety is so inspiring. coming from someone who has anxiety ur so amazing with talking about it. and matt your not boring. anyone could listen to you for hours on and and keep wanting more. ur so amazing and i’m so grateful for you. ur such a great person and u seem so real. i feel like you can make anyone genuinely happy if you even just give them a smile. your such a great person. i’m so grateful for you.

I feel the same way with my anxiety so I totally understand how you feel
Don’t get me wrong I love you with Nick and Chris but I love hearing you talk without being interrupted.
You did so good and im really excited for the next. i love you💛
the way u put meaning into everything is so amusing about u, this is why i love you
he thinks he is boring but he’s definitely not, he’s just more calm and reserved and keeps to himself more which has never ever been a bad thing! it’s sad that he thinks he is boring as an individual cause he definitely isn’t
love u matt I have a video idea, u can paint whaterver u want and please don't think that you're boring, because you're a incredible person<3
matt i love watching you and i can watch you for hours and hours no matter how boring you say you are you aren’t at all i can rewatch your videos ten thousand times a day

I love that we got a chance to hear Matt talk because I could listen to him for hours and hours, and I’m excited to hear and watch each of them individually especially since Matt is usually quiet
You should kiss the camera for the outro cause we all love that
“damn I was blowing everything” 😭
You should do a who knows me best with you mom and dad

attachment issues..  Me too matt
I feel like Matt has a great potential of making great YouTube videos!❤️
As someone with anxiety, i love the fact that you want to speak more on anxiety and share your own experience with it, as a creator that’s an amazing thing to do, when your ready to share your experience we are here to listen !
I was blowing everything 💀💀 13:43
I FUCKING LOVE THE VIDEO, it was entertaining, i need more content from you
i hate how he thinks hes boring he's really not he's honestly the most entertaining because I understand him lol
your editing style is so good the random cuts and comments are hilarious 😭😭
I litterally love matt so much
i didn’t know how much i needed this video. everything you said, i thought and lived it. i swear it never felt so relieving and comforting just to hear you talk about random shit. i really appreciate what you do. you are such a beautiful and special person. i hope a notification pops up soon from here:)
aww matt, dont ever say “i’m boring” again! you’re not boring you’re an amazing person:) but i def like these types of vid and you need to def make more like these where you just talk, your voice is so soothing and calming. i would def like vids where you talk abt your anxiety bc you have helped me through mine and to not worry so much abt it! so thank you matt:) love you!!
we love you so much, matt, don’t feel that you’re less interesting than nick and chris. we love your personality because you are you.
I have anxiety too, and this literally helps me. This makes me feel like im not alone and that people understand. I loved this first video! I hope Matt is able to grow and learn more about himself!
“ damn I was blowing everything “ 😭😭 stfu

Matt, you're such a wonderful creator - as 1 of 3 but just as well individually. So excited to see more solo content <3
THIS IS SLAYJOR
i dont usually comment on stuff lol but i really enjoyed this vid, you’re so interesting even without ur brothers!! this is a big W for matt fans such as myself
i love you so much, matt. you’re a huge inspiration to me.
the end part when he talks about the snacks he bought and he never had time to eat them makes me sad bc he’s all alone and he’s used to being with his brothers but i’m glad he’s going to be more comfy by himself
17:40 bring the kiss outtros back!
omg so good ilyyy
MATT YOURE NOT FUCKING BORING
i totally get the anxiety thing it’s not like it’s so terrible that i can’t function but it’s always there and underlying and then i get kinda used to it just being there for the ride and whatnot
I drink pickle juice out of the jar…
i feel like ur gonna be the next emma chamberlain, it’s like i can listen to u for so long. if u know what i mean. also love u so much and trust me ur not boring xxx
Amazing that Matt is the first one to post a solo video!!!
matt is so wise bro. he needs to realize that we will enjoy whatever content he puts out, though!
This is so weird but so good cuz I’m so used to seeing all three of them 🤣
super excited for future videos !! as someone with anxiety i’m happy to hear a creator i look up to talk about the same things i go through :) lots of love matt
i’m so incredibly proud of you matt <3 you’re such a comfort to watch by yourself and you mean so much to everyone and keep growing as yourself and we love you matt <3
love you matt <3 i have a lot of social anxiety too so i'd love to hear about your experiences (p.s. you're not boring without nick and chris!)
matt i love u bro ur such a genuine person,good job for u first time editing u did good<3.
you did well, matt <33 you aren't boring...in fact, only hearing you talk is just enough entertaining for me ❤
well done Matt! proud of you! Also great editing and it’s amazing seeing you talk 😂
we love you matt🫶🏼
i would love to see some opinion videos, like your opinions on certain things. Or just like a long talk about things that you get asked in the comments, you are doing great. I have a feeling i’m really going to enjoy your videos!
the editing is hilarious but you should def post a lot your so relatable and I can listen to you talking about stuff forever.
matt you need to stop doubting yourself we really love you, you are a huge slay king lmaoo
You did amazing, try not to be so hard on yourself. Also the elevator music during the text parts cracked me up, idk why
Omg
matt don't worry abt "being entertaining" or whatever, we're here to get to know *you*, so just do whatever you want cause we'll enjoy it as long as you're enjoying it. does that makes sense? I hope it does 💀😙✨
I love you❤😘
monday with matt💖 can you post a video every monday 😉🐕
As someone who has anxiety and can’t be without my best friend…. You made perfect sense :) and I think your very entertaining 😂
i loved this so much! i swear you’re not boring matt i love your personality and humor! i can’t wait for future videos!
Matt stop doubting yourself plsss 😭 ur amazing and this video was funny and entertaining!! Ur a very genuine person. I love listening to you talk just be yourself. Talk about your anxiety talk about your life problems come on here and rage whenever you feel like raging!!! Ily ❤️❤️
HANDSOME AF😭
MONDAYS WITH MATT
matt don’t doubt yourself you did so good
i love every second of this
two things... 1. your earrings are so sick and 2. when you locked the doors after seeing someone i actually laughed out loud
I LOVE MATTS PERSONAL VIDEOS😝 i’m so so here for it!!! fr matt can post whatever he wants and i will be FULLY entertained HAHAHAHA
MATT. KEEP MAKING MORE VIDEOS THESE ARE SO ENTERTAINING U DONT UNDERSTAND
It’s so sad that he thinks he is boring. He is so genuinely funny and a very entertaining person on his own. The little comments you added in and not being interrupted definitely made it more entertaining. You’ll get more comfortable and it will be more natural but that was a fantastic first video!!! Wonderful job Matt!
Don’t ever doubt yourself matt. We all love you as a triplet & we love you with your brothers… but we also love you individually! Stay strong! I loved this video 🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼
this is a great first video 🦾
I had so much fun watching this I love the video and the editing and I love you don’t doubt yourself you’re doing great
i think i speak for all of us when i say in no way are you boring! you talking about your troubles and anxiety has really helped me! you appreciated matt keep and the great work!
matt you’re doing amazing and you’re definitely not boring <3
i love you so much matt <3
did not expect matt to be the first one to upload. so proud of him 🤞🏼 but literally love you sm matt.
matt don’t doubt yourself, you aren’t boring, you do have a personality you just have to learn how to show it when you are on your own. nobody here is judging. you are so used to being interrupted you interrupt yourself 😂💕
I relate to Matt so much. And I love that he is talking about anxiety because a lot of people don’t take it seriously.
Matt, I love how you opened up about your anxiety. Mine really progressively got worse as I started middle school 2 years ago and you talking about it really helped me realize that I’m not alone. You, Nick, and Chris as a whole have also really helped. Your videos are like free therapy lmao
thank you for sharing matt. we love you so so much, and we are here for you. thank you for putting a smile on your face for us. <3
idc what y’all say matt is so comforting
matt i think you are very entertaining. i love hearing your thoughts and you talking without any interruptions or distractions. i think you are doing an amazing and im so so excited to see what you have next for us. xoxo
Matt you doubt yourself too much man. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to you just talk, and idc if I was the only one (which I'm not). You don't need anyone else to be entertaining or fun, just be yourself and the people that like you for that will and have find/found you.
lmao i love how the video just starts off like that
So we have a giant stage in our school and I have to go up there alone and I have extreme anxiety and we're doing it Wednesday and I'm terrified
VIDEO IDEA - literally just play any video game you enjoy. I think people would enjoy watching you play especially because it’s something we really haven’t seen from you. ok that’s all
i love you 🫂 always here for you boogie!!
Please do more cool clothes I buy
END THE VIDEO WITH THE KISS CAM LIKE YOU USE TO!!!!!
so does everyone accidentally say depressing shit while talking to other people
I like the anxiety talk because most people have it because everyone has a different perspective on there anxiety.
Ur doing great sweetie  Stop doubting yourself
love the editing matt
This felt like FaceTime I loved it so much I could hear Matt talk for hours
loved all the ideas fs clothing hauls sound so fun since you have super good style 👍🏼
Matt please I need you to know you’re NOT BORING! At all. You’re an amazing person and this video made me so happy!! You did so well and I hope you don’t think less of yourself, and whatever you feel like to do here will be really welcomed but I would definitely love to see a real anxiety talk, like you said there’s not enough talk about it
Literally in love with this man.
THE MEMORIES THING YES
ur bigger than your anxiety matt, do what makes you feel comfortable. trust we feel lucky alr lmao
bro, you're simply amazing! you have this unique energy that just by being yourself makes you so special and gets everybody so hooked up that we just keep watching and wanting more. I know this is terrible feedback for the channel cause I have no video ideas whatsoever, but just by watching this I had to let you know how amazing you are. never change <3
i love this!! the editing is something i wasn't expecting but IM HERE FOR IT!!
yesss i love matt’s editing💕 also love how you did the video in the van HAHAHAHA
Lol this is funny and painful and idk- I GOT HERE MYSELF  and I like cheese
these comments are so sweet 🥲 we love just listening to you talk matt, no matter what it is. we don’t love you only when you’re with your brothers, we love you for you 🫶🫶
I absolutely love that you’re willing to experience and expand your comfort zone by doing this ❤️ it’s encouraging for others as well who might be on the fence as well.  Also the little commentary with the like the elevator music is KILLING ME 😂😂😂😂
editing give off emma chamberlain vibes and i literally love it so much; also he needs to not doubt himself. i know if hard but he did great and this is my like 3rd time watching it
i loved this so much. the commentary in between clips was sooo funny !! you’re doing great matt and i’m proud of you for stepping out of your comfort zone for us. i cant wait to start the journey of growth through this channel and maybe most of us can grow with you <3
This is awesome and I love you and the talk of anxiety would be good cuz I have high functioning anxiety ❤️
aw i love u so much matt ur not boring don't doubt urself ur amazing as fuck 🫶
I think its a good thing that you started your own personal channel bc like you said your gonna grow your gonna be able to see that through the channel but so is everyone else and its cool to see you by yourself without your other brothers
Sorry I’m commenting a lot but yes clothing hauls would be really cool!!
i love this video.
Love you Matt
HIII
i feel like matt doesn’t get to share the way he feels that much in the triplet videos but i’m glad he’s doing this and we get to hear more from him.
I felt strange seeing matt alone in the car without his brothers lol, but im happy how matt is open to us ❤️ i love this guy sm ❤️
i love how he says “pichers” it’s so freaking cute 😭
I love your sitting down and talking videos there honestly so entertaining
matt talks so bad about himself when he isnt with nick and chris but i hope he realizes that he is such an amazing and interesting person alone. i hope he makes more personal videos because this video was handled very well for a person who has been around to two other people for their whole life.  <3
matt your amazing keep doing what you do
i absolutely loved this video! hearing Matt talk about his anxiety and how he’s going to be making videos about it really warms my heart. it makes me realize i’m not alone. i love how open he is with us. Matt is such a genuine person, with such a pure soul. i can’t wait to see him thrive on his personal channel!
i LOVED this
You say your a bland person when your also but I think that you got the entertainment part covered lol also i like how your open about your anxiety cause I have anxiety and not gonna lie your made me more open about my anxiety and less scared for people to know

Do Q & A’s or advice videos!!!
This is amazing what youre doing Matt! Use this channel for what ever, you are the entertainment dont worry about being entertaining. Youre the triplet that I go to the shared channel to see, you have a really calm and self aware aura/energy/what ever you wanna call it and it calms my own anxiety so thank you!!
I love this for you

You are absolutely NOT boring. & i’m so happy and proud you are opening up to us about your anxiety and sharing your feelings and thoughts it makes it more comfortable for the rest of us that struggle too❤️I would love to watch anything you do, whatever your comfortable with!
the “get em when you get em and don’t get em when you don’t get em” was giving very much mary lou’s “everywhere you go there you are” LMAOOOOO
i was the same way with the recorder i could never remeber any of the notes so i’d just take it home and blow it in my sisters ears
ENDING 🥲😂😂😂🙌🏻💀
WAIT ACTUALLY YOU SHOULD DO VIDEO GAMES!!!

slay kitten
For one, your not boring- I laugh at your jokes and expressions the most. I swear this video is so heartbreaking for no reason- ilysm and I want you to know that everyone who support you, are watching this channel and we are all here for it!!
you should go to various fast food places try one specific food and rate and compare them
I subscribed as soon as the first clip played
You should play monecraft
you should drive around and talk
SYOP DOUBTING YOURSELF MATT!!! YOU CAN DO THIS
honestly i really like how chill and real you are so props to you i’m excited for more content even if it’s not much <3
he reminds me of early emma chamberlain videos
Agree on the sidekick tho superhero Is too much work
I feel like Matt is literally almost the same person as I am. I feel you on the anxiety and always feeling boring but I can tell you this much, YOURE NOT BORING. You literally never fail to make me laugh or smile at any point of the day. At when you noticed me for the first time, I cried
matt you're honestly so well-spoken - I think your videos will have success because of just how you are as a person. you are not boring either! this was really enjoyable to watch and honestly very relaxing.
matt I love you so much
Wizard at the cello
I could watch you talk for hours
I think talking about anxiety would be super insightful for others who share that as well. I would find that beneficial and make me feel heard. I also think sharing ways you cope with that would be helpful.  Also clothing hauls would be super dope.
you don’t know how proud i am of u
what is matt does a cooking show with a lil talk sesh
matt you're not boring, watching your videos feels like just listening to an entertaining friend talk in a calming way. like your'e not too over stimulating which is a good thing. I feel like a lot of content on youtube has gotten too extreme and annoying but yours is just entertaining and  easy going which is perfect.
Literally so happy you made a personal channel!! I’m also really excited to hear your anxiety videos and how you deal with it because it would really help me.
You got this dude great first vid
oh my god when i tell you his editing style got me GIGGLING like at the start i was like aww cute matty b learning to edit and then just every thought editing matt had was interjected in all pink and elevator music… now THAT is art
hjjcjfjfjfkd pls keep that outro 🦅
As I person with anxiety, thank you, I love you.
I loved this! It was so much more chill and relaxed. I know this channel will be awesome.
YO I PLAY THE CELLO
You are my comfort person 👫
I could literally listen to Matt for the rest of my life and never get tired, even if it’s him trying to explain stuff that doesn’t make sense. He brings me sm comfort bro🤥
I love uuuu
you should still do vlogs! literally a day in the life would be cool! even if its just you waking up and doing laundry💀 also maybe behind the scenes of filming the vids and how the day goes before/after
maybe your channel could be you trying different things without them yk find what you like
We love you Matt don’t ever think that your “boring” or “annoying” we come for all 3 of you guys Nick Matt and Chris I personally think all of you guys are so perfectly slightly different in a good way and it really just brings it all together and without you the Sturniolo triplets wouldn’t be the Sturniolo triplets. I’m happy that you started this channel and have loads of fun and can’t wait for more future plans<3
I love these individual videos!! It’s fun to see you 3 interact, but it’s also really nice to get to know yall as individuals! You are so funny and NOT boring Matt!!☺️ Can’t wait for the anxiety talks, I feel like that will help a bunch of us💕
awwww this was the best matt dont doubt yourself so much :( and you are so strong to put yourself out there without your brothers you got this:)
This is my third time watching, this was so beyond comforting. I’m so proud of him and I can’t wait to see how far he’s going to go and how this channel might help him learn more stuff about himself<3
Loved the vídeo, the editing style and hearing u talk for the hole video,  can't wait for the next one
I’m actually really happy that they are all doing individual channels because it’s gonna be so building for them in multiple ways. Obviously love them all together but they are amazing people alone as well!! so I’m very excited for their individual videos!! So proud of them all ❤️
let’s hope that editing was mayt cause if it was nick he would just be straight trolling lmfao
Do a shopping video. Buy bunch of cool stuff. Or maybe online shop adding lots of your wish stuff to carts even if you don’t buy everything
First vid alone!
YOUR NOT BORING!!!!! We all love you more than you realize sweetheart and we are so fucking proud of you. I love you and your brothers with my whole heart ❤️❤️
matt we love you thank you for this
Matt you need to stop doubting youself hun. You are so worthy and entertaining. Nothing about you is boring, please dont bring yourself down 💞 love you
i love u
It hurt my heart every time he said he was boring :(
❤️❤️❤️❤️
hearing u just talk is so calming
im actually so impressed with the way this turned out, I could literally watch a million videos with just matt cuz he’s genuinely so entertaining and funny
This was perfect.
Thhh the is video was great Matt!!!!!! So exited to hopefully see more. Any content from you and your brothers is gold to us
hey matt don’t say your boring because you aren’t I relate a lot to you and it is nice knowing there are people like me and I love your personality
please talk about your anxiety, i feel as if i really need it. my anxiety is terrible and there’s so much nobody knows about it. counseling, missing school due to panic attacks every morning, never staying with friends and family, and overall just everything i do in life.
Make more video's , I really like this 😍❤️👍🏼
question for u: how has youtube and social media in general affected ur mental health on this influencer journey?
do “drives with me” if you want to
you’re not boring matt :(. You’re literally the best. No need to have “entertaining” videos. You talking is just as entertaining as someone playing vid games ykyk :). Dont rush yourself on posting on here! Its okay love, take your time and just do you. Once again YOU’RE NOT BORING MAN, everything about you is perfect, agree or disagree just hearing you talk is entertaining 🫶🏾.
i understand the feeling bland thing. this is coming from a twin who is never apart from her sister. i am leaving her for over a week this summer and i’m terrified bc we’ve never been apart for more than 48 hours
No pressure to be entertaining! love just hanging out and doing nothing/talking/eating in videos, just makes me feel like I have a friend to hang out with :)
i’m promise you matt you are so entertaining alone and you did this so incredibly well, the editing killed me i loved it.
I am so beyond excited to see more videos in the future. You are connecting with so many people including me and I am so happy to see you starting to step out of your comfort zone. I cant wait to see you grow as a person and to gain some confidence in knowing that we all support you 100%. You are such a genuine person and I find such comfort in watching your content. Love you Matt <3
Omg I love this. Matt is absolutely amazing and I’m excited to see what else he does including with the triplets (the editing was hilarious too)💗
You are not boring❤️ you make everyone who watches these videos feel so comforted and safe. We love you
I'm so happy and excited to see u grow as a person by yourself, really hope u have fun doing stuff for ur personal channel ❤
The fact that I screamed when I say this notification!! I love matt so much he is the best and just a genuine good person and most relatable triplet for me!!
I love watching you talk and i love your editing :))
Keep going Matt, you've got this.
It would help me and maybe even other people with the anxiety talks because my anxiety has flared up really bad lately
This is the cutest video ever
you're such a comfort person wow
MATT, your not boring at all. we all love you and this type of content <33 living for it
ur slaying matt dont worry about anything do what u want we are all for it ::))
“DAMNNNN I WAS BLOWING EVERYTHING” I LAUGHED SO LOUD😭
I can relate to this kid so much
matt you’re so awesome
i liked the ideas you had ! you should definitely do sit down talks because i feel like a lot of us can relate and it helps us all. you should also do pranks😹because they’re funny
Matt you have to do the signature kiss the camera for an outro!!! I cannot believe you forgot. PLEASEEEEEEE
do a video and say what the best and worst thing about chris and nick
I love Matt sm, Its so sad when he says he’s boring and self doubts himself :( ily Matt❤️❤️
matt you doubt yourself so much. i do the same thing and i relate to you a lot. but i hope you realize how many people admire you <3 you’re not boring at all. i could legit watch a video of you sitting in front of the camera and not say anything and i wouldn’t be bored.
So proud of you Matt you did absolutely amazing! I can’t wait for the future videos. You don’t have to feel pressured to upload. Only upload if you want to upload let YouTube be fun. Love you Matt and honestly thank you for everything 🖤
I honestly just love to hear your stories its so entertaining
YOU SHOULD DO A VID ABOUR TRYING NEW STUFF like playing badminton or learning chess or reading or learning how to play the guitar or smth like that
lmao matt i did actually find your personal account from the recommended screen. so :) yeah
When Matt said he wants to do videos about anxiety, I felt so happy because as he said, it's not rly talked about enough and as a person who struggles with it, I feel it would nice for someone else I look up to share their experience with it. Anyways love Matt with my entire soul and always will <3
Matt, you don’t get the idea how happy I am watching u here. Talking about random things, I somehow feel closer to u. I’m always supporting u, I hope you will share things that bothered u. Anxiety.. it is not just a simple thing, I mean it is bad for yourself :( u absolutely should share it with us! tbh u are one of the cutest living creatures in da worldd and I hope you always be happy and healthy :DD sending lots of love for Matthew Bernard Sturniolo. 🫶
I can already tell I'm going to love this channel! I am a huge fan of the Sturniolo Triplets, but also of Matt alone because he seems very relatable and similar to me. But keep doing  this Matt it's very inspiring, especially speaking on important topics such as anxiety
I did enjoy the video keep it up 👍❤️
Don't worry Matt the painfulness is entertaining.
i think video game videos would be awesome matt!
I feel u when u say u get anxiety on small things through out the day cause i do to, one thing that used to make me anxious everyday was to be afraid i would miss the bus to work cause of like one minute, i would look at the clock every 5 secs to see if i would make on time. It's the small things but then they kinda pile up and give me a bad anxiety at the end of the month.  Thank god i realized that and did my best to not feel anxious about it.   I also feel like u talking about it will help a lot of people who are awere or not of their anxiety. Cause it really helps me to hear from someone who feels the same as me, i feel less alone
i love the channel you have with your brother’s but i feel like i’m going to appreciate this channel so much bc out of you nick and chris i feel like i can relate to you the most and the anxiety talks are going to be so helpful
You should keep doing these kind of videos!! I love them 😍
this was genuinely so entertaining, don’t apologize for anything. your editing had me laughing so hard even though it was simple, the pop-ups were hilarious. lots of love !!!! <3
SLAY MATTR
matt ur editing is top tier
you’re doing great matt<3 i love seeing you on your own because now I’ll get to know you better - i’m super excited:)) and also i think it’s great that u want to talk about anxiety. even though you have your own experience i think a lot of people can relate and it’ll be great for them (and hopefully you). i adore u matt and i love getting to know u better

matt you are everything but boring and you are such an entertaining and funny person to watch even without ur brothers 🙏 I could listen to you talking for hours and hours. you opening up about ur anxiety is fucking great, ong as u said it should be given more attention and u doing so with ur platform is inspiring ash. u will probably never even see this but ur truly amazing never stop what ur doing bro<333
Please do more like this you’ve made my day so much better
i seriously love these talking videos; i don't know what it is but i just think the setting of a car is so fitting for conversation, and for me, talking videos kind of make me feel more like connected to the creator somehow as if i'm actually talking with them about the things that matter to them, and a majority of the time i'm watching the video to get to know the creator more and not so much for entertainment. so honestly i don't think it's so much as what's the most 'entertaining' thing nowadays but more of keeping it real. really enjoyed the video and sending best wishes your way 💌
Im so proud of you making this video i hope you still have the hype to make another and love you sm ❤️
i love him sm, he deserves everything
I get him I have two siblings and doing anything without them is weird as hell.
This video made me realize that we actually have a lot in common, like how we think and deal with anxiety, as you were talking about the rings I actually said that they make me claustrophobic right before you did and that made me laugh bc ppl always think I’m crazy when I say that😂 but yea Matt this channel is gonna help lots of people and just post whatever you feel like posting we will watch it👍
good first video matt proud of u also i think the screaming outro works well
why was this honestly comedy gold
this is so comforting
this made me smile sm, i could hear him talk for hours, i love him so much
the scream at the end rly summed it up for me
I think making a video about anxiety would be a great idea! Not only would it spread awareness about anxiety and help others feel less alone, it may also be therapeutic for you! Proud of you Matt ❤️
no bc i totally see what your saying about rings and bracelets they feel so weird
matt i promise you aren’t boring babe, you gotta do you and anyone who thinks you are can kick rocks, you’re an amazing person always and we are ALL rooting for you! you got this 100%
i actually really enjoyed this video
Matt is literally me (sees a person walking in the back locks the doors) 😭
Mathewww u are the BEST!!!!! Great job on challenging yourself and being bold!!!!!!Enjoy watching you talking a lot!!!:))))))
You did great
my opinions on video ideas: 1. clothing haul: i love try on hauls that was my fav youtube era! once you get a good batch of clothes you should show them to us and then try to make a cool fit out of it with other stuff you bought/have. then maybe rate the fits yourself for fun? i love this idea :) - a jewelry haul/collection vid could go along with this as well 2. anxiety talk: you have helped so many people already by opening up about anxiety. it really helps to know that you're not alone when it comes to mental illness. providing an outlet for yourself and others is such a great idea and i'm excited to see it!  3. music: maybe you could do this one as a collab with elmer or something! either way you could make it fun like have chris or nick compile a playlist of your favorite songs and you could do 'guess the song' or something cuz it won't get copyrighted. just some ideas but i like the idea of it just being a talk-through video as well :) 4. pranks: your bird prank video on nick is sooo funny i rewatch it all the time. pranks are always fun and entertaining, definitely an idea worth doing !!
Matt is so wholesome, he makes me feel like I don’t have to worry about my anxiety, and I know there are people out there like them who can really help people like me, I’m so blessed that you and your brothers started YouTube because each and every one of you have made a huge impact on me and others by what you guys do. From marking me laugh, to having fun, being serious, and learning a lot more. And also watching you guys from the beginning and looking from where you’ve gone from to where your at right know makes my heart melt. Love you all you guys ~Sincerely -Allanya
I love this video Matt! You may think and feel like you are boring and awkward without your brothers, but just know there are so many people who love watching you and what you have to say!
holy fuck when someone brings up that one "thing" it does bring back alot
OMG, i'm soo happy that you posted a video! Just wanted you to know that you are so funny and kind. YOU ARE NOT BORING LOL. Also love that you are gonna talk about anxiety <3
matt i love you but you look so much like nick in this video. ❤️
whenever you post, whether it's once a month or whatever, it has to AT LEAST be on Mondays. "Mondays with Matt" kinda has a ring to it. 💕
you're definitely not bored matt b! stop doubting your self, you're special and perfect to us the way you are! and the way you edited this plssss it's so funny i love it
Loved this video Matt, you did great👍
hearing you talk about anxiety is so comforting. thank you xxx
I absolutely love the fact that you said you’re going to be talking about your anxiety. You are in no way boring Matt. This video was amazing and I’m so exited to see what else you do from here  (Also your editing skills are great, i love it😂)
You look straight out of a vampire movie (good thing)btw
18 secs in and i love itttttt
Yayyy 1st video! So proud of you Matt, stepping out of your comfort zone and getting to watch yourself grow with Nick & Chris and by yourself. You've come a long way already, now just keep doing what you're doing and everything is going to be okay :). When I first started watching you guys I related to you the most, I'm quiet, I see myself as boring or bland without the people that bring out the best of me, and its a bit difficult for me when it comes to trying new things. I think this channel is going to help you grow and allow you to progress in the best way possible :).
MATT YOU LITERALLY SOUND AND LOOK LIKE THE COMBINATION OF NICK AND CHRIS (obviously) BUT LIKE LITERALLYY
Hi
keep the outro simple, say bye, then give it a little scream
Go off king
matt i absolutely loved this video!!
This man is perfect in every single way
Also perfect end with the scream 😂
no cause same, i have attachment issues with my twin sister and it’s so hard trying to do and learn to do things without her. buts it’s cool to try new expierences by yourself and it’s so cool you have your personal channel to talk about those
This was just randomly recommended to me somehow! I’ve not seen you before. I like your personality 😄☺️
I love you matt
I wish I can subscribe like a million times
🫶🫶🫶
editor matt is funny asf
I could hear matt talking for hours but never fucking get tired
Matt i have truly waited for this moment. Out of you all (even tho i love all 3 of ypu) i feel like you have sm to say and that so many of ur fans will relate/ i cant wait to see the content you put out and support you along the way because you deserve the love and recognition thats soon to come your way, never doubt yourself cause youre doing great!! :(( <33
I loved the random comments with the background music 😂 I truly love to see ur trying to find yourself while creating this channel and it’s refreshing to see a male content creator speak up about mental health and even if you thing your anxiety isn’t “severe” don’t ever feel as if you need to minimize it any form of mental health issues absolutely suck but I’m again I’m glad to see you’re able to speak up about it and stop doubting yourself you’re clearly a wonderful human being much love keep it up!  🤍
i know you question yourself a lot and you said you are boring, but i can tell that you truly care about us and you are doing a great job. i think it’s so inspiring for you to speak about anxiety! keep doing you matt, you’re doing a great job! btw i love you!
Don't change anything your doing so fucking great do what you like we'll fucking love you no matter what
love you sm and am so proud of you xxx
te amoooo
Im so excited for this channel Matt. I struggle so much with anxiety and attachment issues as well. I usually thrive when im around other people to I completely understand where you are coming from. Thank you so much for acknowledging anxiety <3
He doubts himself alot but honestly matt you got this. I fucking love you millions of people out there fucking loves you. Your doing great I love you
I loved this matt I love u
Omg this is golden
matt you are very entertaining no need to doubt yourself ily
considering this was ur first video alone i think u did an amazing job <3 i just know these videos are gonna help a lot of people 🤍
These vids are like FaceTime which I luvvvv keep it up
Someone drank pickle juice from the pickle jar after I scanned it and I was deeply disturbed, and just kept scanning their groceries
when the pink words pop up i read it and hear it in his voice and i just laugh
matt not getting interrupted by nick or chris for 18 minutes should be the title💀
matt! the great thing about videos like this is you don't have to know what you're talking about and we (as fans of the triplets channel) always love it when you guys get off track. it makes for the best content and it's natural! try not to be so hard on yourself, we appreciate everything you do and we love you for it! <3
His giving such Emma Chamberlain Vibes in the best way possible!!!
It's so weird hearing Matt talk this much. I love it 😂
this was so cute
wasnt bored at all during this vid if it makes you feel any better :)
love rhis
Please do the anxiety talk!!! I have really bad anxiety and it would help a lot❤️‍🩹
BRING BACK THE CAMERA KISSES AT THE END OF THE VIDEOS
I would rlly like if u talk about anxiety because Ive experienced it a lot too and i also think a lot of others have aswell.
loved this video Matt, u doubt urself way too much like I honestly love watching u individually. ur entertaining and amazing, I cannot stress enough how much u have helped me so u do u and do what u want to. and we will 100% enjoy it <3
Gonna prolly re-watch alot
💜
Honestly, matt is a perfect example of what goes on inside of my head, and i love it
instagram link in the bio is wrong, matt.
i like this channel sm! i know it’s the first video but i enjoy hearing matt and his points because when it’s all three of them one of them is always getting interrupted
i love this video so much 💞💞 i love how you’re so open about your mental health. keep up the amazing work <3
This video was great. He made so much sense and I am the same way with anxiety. It's minor, but still there. I would like to see any videos where he does what makes him happy! Also I think another way to describe how he feels without Nick and Chris. I think a good way to describe it is as walking on a tightrope without the safety net, because I ( Now I am just assuming because I have never done anything like this, on this level) feel he has more pressure on himself to keep the video going whereas on the other channel he can take a few seconds to relax and gather his thoughts. Anyways, I loved the video and will be very excited each time a new one comes out.
Hearing matt talk about and anxiety and that he'll prolly do more videos about it makes me so proud of him I love him so fucking much ❤
I literally love this video and the little edits make it 10x more funnier. You made such a big impact on my life Matt you made me feel so much better about my anxiety
Thank you for putting a smile in my face today! I needed it I’ve had a really rough day today and this video made it better 😁
his energy is so calming <333
bring back the goodbye kisses PLEASE WE MISS IT
i loved learning more about you! please keep sharing videos with us; i relate to you in sm ways! love you ❤️ and you have a great sense of humor lmaooo
he seems to be doubtful of himself, but i found this really entertaining. he has such a big impact talking about his personal life meaning the stuff he hasn’t covered yet. you don’t have to be loud and bright to make an impact, the most meaningful things can be from shy people who aren’t used to being alone. overall matt makes me feel comfortable, love youuu! <33
omg i’ll never get over how pretty he is
Matt! Anxiety is something I deal with too, and this video is great bc I like just having something chill to watch. You’re not boring at all just getting to know you is very entertaining.
It's funny how all the craziness and loudness is what I like the most on the triplet videos and here I am rewatching a 18min long video of just you talking alone, and I'm really enjoying it. You are really entertaining for someone who is so insistent and sure about being boring.
i love this sm happy to see a vid where you get the chance to talk LMAO
This video made me feel safe. I related to everything he said and just made me feel comfortable 💗 I can’t talk about this stuff with a lot of people so this made me happy that someone relates to me and others 🥰
Love you so much! I think you need to give yourself much more credit for how amazing you are💗 Looking forward to any and all videos you make💓💗💗
I really liked the video Matt, you're funny and I'm happy that we get to listen to you a little bit more :))
“thank you God” AMEN
pls play roblox 😍
What the fuck is up YouTube
“In the most not pick me way possible” lmaoo
bro ily
i... i just saw this on my recommended. uploaded 2 hours ago, don't know who this is but I'm here for the ride i guess
no but i totally understand what he is saying about being without nick in chris. i’m best friends with my siblings, and when they all went to college it forced me to figure out what my personality actually was, because a large part of my personality had come from them. and there definitely still is a side of me that is only comes out with my siblings. they’ve become a big part of who i am, and played a big role in who i’ve become. when you’re so close to someone for your whole life sometimes its hard to figure out who you are without them.
This video made me crave pickles
Don’t worry about trying to always entertain us, just do or talk about what you enjoy. Either way, I’m so excited to see what you post next. Loving the clothing haul idea thoo
Hey Matt, I would rlly like u to talk abt ur anxiety, as an anxious person, I just want to relate to something.
I'm so excited to see more of matt<33 I love you matt I'm so fucking proud of you
I hope Matt knows how much we truly all love him
Enjoyed watching the video, Matt!  It is great to hear you talk more without getting interrupted (even though your vids together are entertaining). I do think this will be a cool learning and growth experience for you and I'm looking forward to seeing how it goes :) Remember not to put too much pressure on yourself, you are enough
matt, this was such a good video. you’re editing was good, it was entertaining, and i loved this video a lot. can’t wait for the next one! <3
I really hope you talkin about anxiety bc you impact so much in my life and my anxiety
thank you for this!! i 100% believe that this will help you have positive growth!!
I think if you talked about your anxiety I think that would help a lot of people out
Matt is honestly so entertaining alone and I love these talk videos. I would watch anything he posts and I smiled when I saw the notification pop up when I entered YouTube. He doubts himself a lot and he really shouldn’t. He’s so entertaining and has a chill vibe and that’s great!!
I relate to him alot 😭❤
I just love the editing hahaha my fav part
Nice to hear your voice for this long cause Chris' and Nick's voices are all over in my head while yours is lighter.. Love 💕
The scream I just let out----
i've had anxiety basically my entire life, im pretty sure its a part of a disorder i may have. at first it was because i had really bad speech problems when i was a kid and since then its just became its own thing. school hasn't been helping and i got a psych evaluation back from the district recently. turns out im on the severe side and might need to get tested for a few things. my therapist mentions adhd sometimes. what im getting to is you make me feel so much better about having it and living with it, i know you dont mention it a lot but the idea that you'll probably be touching on it here is amazing to hear. Nobody in my social circle has anxiety like i do. they dont have anxiety, they just get anxious sometimes if that makes sense. you make me feel so safe and just :)))
I hate how much he is insecure and it makes me sad because he thinks he is boring but he’s not !
The best youtuber
This was such a wholesome video, you're doing great Matt please keep it up I love you so much. This was so relaxing to listen to, don't doubt yourself so much, you are very entertaining as a person!  Everyone here is rooting for you :))
✨
him talking about how he can’t wear rings because it’s a claustrophobia thing, like finally someone who gets it
So Proud of YOU!!!! much love Mathew :)))))
I love how Matt is open up about his anxiety and his experience with it!  And btw Matt u have never ever been boring ur so comforting and chill similar to me it’s so entertaining:)) 🤍🤍
matt this was amazing u should be proud
You’re doing so great Matt! I honestly think this channel could help you get out of your comfort zone! We love you Matt🤍🤍🤍
I think speaking on your anxiety would be super helpful for me and many others that go through it and your not boring lol whenever your videos come out I would watch them
Now that it’s just matt, i can see the resemblance of the other 2 more…like i can see it when they’re together but cuz they’re all there, i cant really appreciate the resemblance😂 i just see them as them…now with matt, i can see the other 2 too😂😂😂
he really needs to bring the kiss at the end for his personal channel and the scream for all three of their channel.
Matt I love the editing
THIS WAS MAD FUNNY😭 I love learning more about you on your own!
this dude saying he is boring but I could straight listen to him talk about nothing for hours 💕
This is the kindest and warmest comment section i’ve ever been in, and honestly no one deserves it more than Matt.
I love how you are so open about your anxiety. I also struggle with it as well  Your doing amazing I love you 💜🫶🏻🥴
AWWW HI MATT
Matt real question how long did this take to edit
ur my favorite matt
so nice to hear Matt speak for a full 18 minutes o my god 😭😭😭🫶🏼❤️‍🩹
definitely do some anxiety talks they are very relatable and u have helped sm people with it including me love u matt❤️
Hey Matt, honestly you have nothing to worry about, the little sentences on the screen are very funny, your voice is calming, even I struggle to speak/forget what I was about to say mid sentence sometimes oh and don't worry everything made perfect sense so like, just be yourself and it's gonna be fine. You're a smart, creative and funny kid I just think that maybe you haven't realised it yet. Who knows perhaps having a space like this where you can shine right through without interruptions will help you with that. I really hope so, you deserve the world.  Good luck.                                 - Veronica  P.s: don't stress too much about the frequency of your uploads 'cause, you know, we're grateful for whatever. Upload whenever you feel like it the most, we're all here just to support you.
This was so good!! I’m so excited for you to talk about you and learn more about you!! You’re perfectly entertaining so don’t worry about that
its so cool to be able to learn about him more after just one personal video, even though ive watched every single video of all 3 of them. matt #King
I’m so glad that I found someone that understand and can explain about anxiety
i love u babe
“Im craving a pickle” 🤨
i love matt so much and just simply hearing him talk for 20 minutes was so comforting. he has helped me with my anxiety so much and i cannot wait to hear more from him. his personality is amazing and he’s such a cool person, i hope he knows how much we appreciate him<3
I've been struggling a lot with anxiety and hearing that you're willing to be so open about it makes me super excited to see what you do on this channel!
i relate on most of the stuff u just said 😭
Absoluuutly loveeeed this vid !!!!!!
No I want a pickle
also your editing is better than Nicks 🤡 *sorry nick I love you but his lil pink screen talks to himself is so fun*
I am praying for your anxiety <3 love always transcends fear and anything is possible through God.
I wish you wouldn’t underestimate yourself Matt. You’re doing great and honestly I’d watch anything you’re willing to put out. I just enjoy watching your content, it’s very comforting :) I’m so proud of u <33
Enjoyed the video, looking forward to more! I would say maybe instead of cutting to the comments to yourself and playing the music you could just put the phrase on the screen so it doesn’t interrupt the flow of the video as much
This is my favourite video <33
i could see from now on how all his videos will be calm and just chill to watch I like that
I haven't even finished your video and I just want to say, please only post when you want to! Don't feel pressured. I do love just watching and hearing you talk about your interests and thoughts, but do what makes you happy and what you are comfortable with. We all love you and appreciate you! 🤍
Matt you killed the editing!!
Thank you for recognizing to bring up the anxiety topic. That’s all hard topics for everyone <3
You should kiss the camer at the end, bring that back
you can talk about absolutely anything for an hour and trust me i'd still watch that video , absolutely enjoy it , and then rewatch it a couple days after ❤️
you should kiss the camera goodbye for the outro :)))
One of my old friends drinks the pickle juice from the jar lmao
u have such calming energy and watching you just talk to the camera is so therapeutic for me. especially hearing u talk about anxiety and normalizing it makes me feel like i’m not crazy. thank u we love u
dude i absolutely cannot WAIT to see more from matt, i love him sm and this was entertaining
HI
ILYSM MATT<3
this was very enjoyable to watch! loved the way you edited it like you were replying to yourself lol. SO, so excited for your future content! the clothing haul idea seems so interesting ❤
Matt you slayed that
MATT I LOVE YOUU
I loved to hear Matt talk this hole video and love the editing I thought it was so funny
Im so happy your doing this!
Tbh watching you alone makes you more relatable. Also you’re not boring you just haven’t discovered yourself enough because you’re always compared to your brothers.
i feel like i relate to matt the most so this video was really chill and i loved it
Not gonna lie this is PEAK entertainment for me. More of this, please :)
I'm so proud of him I don't think he realizes how much this vid have already affected ppl to get to know that everyone and anyone can deal with anxiety problems is kinda reassuring I'm so glad he's gonna talk more ubt this and I'M SO PROUD OF U MATTY❤️
also congrats on your first solo video!!🥺
This was so brave and I loved it! I get really bad anxiety too so I just hope you know you’re not alone! I think doing personal videos will help you be more structural. Love you Matt!!
what about a fashion show? i feel like you'd be good like that!
how can you think you’re boring? STOPPP you are not.
THE EDITING IS SO FUNNY MATT IM DYING
Honestly he could sit in silence and still be entertaining lmao  , I’ve never met an influencer like Matt that’s so open about anxiety and I appreciate it sm. Makes me feel less alone , can’t wait for the next vid ❤️
lmfao the way he edited the video like he responses to himself. I love it Matt, please talk about anxiety, it'll help a lot of us.
make videos that make you happy to create and we will enjoy it <3
You don’t sound like an idiot trust me
Matt I’m very happy that you decided to make a video and trust me your not boring
i love this sm
❤️❤️❤️
18:20 love that
I love you Matt❤️❤️❤️
I LOVE MATT STURNIOLO!!
I will watch whatever videos you decide to make because I honestly think you are one of the leats boring people I've seen, you're able to catch my attention for like 98% of the time, and on that note I would love to watch you play video games, I think that even if you don't think you are very good like if you are having fun it will probaly be even more entertaining than watching a pro play the game So yeah this is my opinion, take your time and do what you feel like doing, ly
I think gaming videos would be so funny and entertaining!!
PLEASE DO GAME PLAYS IK THEY WOULD BE SO FUNNY
I really liked this Matt! you just sitting here talking was enough don’t ever doubt you’re content fr. even if you don’t post a lot I’ll definitely be watching whenever you do post 🤍
keeping it real gang 🤝
me focused: boi whaaat
I relate to this video I have bad anxiety but also driving anxiety if I don't have another person there too.
Omg I can’t this is literally the best thing that has ever happened!
When he screamed at the end, it sounded like a chicken 🐔 🤣😂 I really hope that you'll post more videos in the future thou ur awesome 👌 👏 😊
pls i love hearing matt talk!!! he’s so funny honestly
matt is so funny the fucking pickle part killed me

u should do a Day in a life I think it would be a good video love u Matt 🫶🏽

please do another video on anxiety, im struggling with it
This whole videos is just the best thing EVER!! 🤣🤣🤣
pickle juice so buss
as someone who also struggles with anxiety, i would love to see you upload videos anxiety related. i feel like it could help a lot of people who also struggle and help us feel like we’re not alone. :)
could listen to you forever 🫶🏼
i love matts editing style 😭 it reminds me of emma chamberlain
Once a month sounds good! Also a cool idea is to have nick and chris write down things they want you to do in a day and then see if you can do it all by yourself
matt you’re not boring! this video was actually so entertaining just hearing you talk about whatever! feels like i’m having a conversation with you!!
omg I love this it actually crazy how simerler we are when taking I showed my friend this and they was like omg its like listening to you talk
any hauls with clothing you love would be a good idea. I really love this Matt you’re doing so well on your own. I think this channel is going to be successful.
After hearing this I feel like Matt never talks in the group channel
I appreciate matt so much for being so open, he's helped so many people including myself. Truly an angel <3
BRO STOP I PLAYED THE CELLO LMAO good times good times
SLAYYY
This video was very good matt for ur first yt video.
He so relatable when we actually hear him speak Lmfaoo🤣
and please make more vids! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
you can do pranks on nick and chris
matt you did absolutely amazing I could literally listen to you all day. you doubt yourself a lot but you genuinely did so good and lots of other people and I would LOVE to watch videos of just you!! love you <33
Loved the editing, it was so funny to see you reacting to and roasting yourself! 🤣 Had a smile on my face the entire video! 😃 10/10
Matt is so comforting
yo i know im not the only one who think hes not boring at all. like 18 mins video flies by real quick. i love the scream outro as usual 🤪
Yes I would love to hear your anxiety talks/story 💕
this is exactly the content we wanted!! hearing more of matt’s personal experiences feels really relatable, especially as someone that is super close with their siblings aswell. i cant wait for more vids 🤍
this feels like an emma chamberlain video and i love it!
ur not boring without nick and Chris
You’re amazing and inspiring Matt. Don’t ever think you’re “boring” or “not entertaining” because that couldn’t be further from the truth. I’m personally really excited to hear you talk about anxiety because I’ve been struggling for a while and things like this help. I’m so pumped for this channel and to watch you grow!!
I love how smoothly he changes subjects he’s really good at keeping a conversation going even if he’s not talking to us face to face or we can’t talk back yk?
I know you think you sound ridiculous when you talk about your feelings or experiences with your anxiety but I promise you you don’t, like I relate to every single thing you said which I actually really needed to hear  Sometimes you feel stupid for how your anxiety affects you but hearing other people share their experiences always helps 🫶
bestie u arent boring at all i promise king <3
This video was so relaxing and calming to watch I really enjoyed it <3
i am so proud of you
i love him so much
you are great matt!❤️
oh my god hi
thank u for talking abt anxiety :)
I agree with Matt when he says it helps him. Finding alone time is hard and at the end of the day we all deserve some
Matt, stop doubting yourself. Look how far u have come. Go at your own pace. Don’t feel like ur making us upset Bc you think “you’re boring” or “won’t be able to post a lot” we all know you guys are busy. Don’t worry about us, worry about yourself first babe.
ILY MATT YOURE DOING GREAT
i feel so “bad” because he kept saying that he wasn’t entertaining and he honestly really was and i loves the editing this is what im gonna call Matt Mondays
but you’re entertaining to me
🤍🤍🤍🤍
you’re so amazing, i’m so proud of u for filming this video and the effort u put into this  i love u
It’s so awkward but still luv it
fix the spelling in your bio matt,love that your going to be talking more about your anxiety and stuff like that 🙀💓
honestly not gonna lie I relate to this kid on a spiritual level and love that he put his thoughts and reaction while watching it back when editing
great video matt!!!!!!
i absolutely love the clothing and  anxiety ideas as topics for your personal channel. I really like your style and the clothes you ear it actually gives me a lot of inspo. I also really relate to you with your anxiety as I heard you talking about it in the cufboys podcast so I would love to hear about that!! you did amazing on your first video and I love the editing haha!!
Thankyou matt for waiting to be open about your mental health it helps alot love you and its brave of you to do this you deserve the world keep going:)
boring has such negative connotations to it and entertaining has such a wide spectrum and Matt is no where near boring.  Matt is also such a comforting person like he gives loads of people comfort so just seeing him get the chance to speak is so comforting and the fact that he is going to use his platform to promote mental health and anxiety is amazing 🤍🤍
you don’t realise how much I’m proud of you and how much I love you Matt<3 keep doing what your heart tells you to do, believe me i’m not here for entertainment at all, i’m here just for you<33 have an amazing day MATTY B :’)
Matt…. We love you and I know how it feels to miss someone and I have anxiety and I hate being alone most of the time <3
The pop up’s are so funny
That ending reminded me of the beginning of the group channel when Matt always dave a kiss in the camera to end the video 😭
Love the outro
I LOVED the text screens that would randomly pop up lol, also I wanted to say that I've had anxiety since around 2016 too but it's become worse in the last year (it's like when someone pours a cup of water into another glass but fills it too much and overflows... 2016 was the initial pour and 2021 was the moment the glass overfilled) so the timing of you saying you'll talk about it is perfect, thank you <3
Do what makes you happy Matt!!! We love just getting to watch you. Have fun with it
matt you should do a drive w/ me !!!
Me and my friend watched this in class and couldnt stop laughing, i was rolling. the popups r killing me HABJHDBJHJSJBHABHDSJHHJDH
we’ll be happy with whatever you put out 🫶🏼🫶🏼 amazing first video matt! ily ily
Matt just talking is so comforting. I feel like he just gets it and I love how honest he is. I feel less alone :)
Bro you are so relatableeee and everything you said actually makes sense. Also your commentary when editing is funny asf.
WHATS IN MY PLAYLIST VIDEO
we would love for you to make another video about how you deal with your anxiety, i dont think ppl realize influencers have feelings and aren’t perfect. We are all human and all have our own shit going on
so so proud of u, i love you
I love everything about this
Hi
I respect you so much for not covering up what you are going through because I can relate to you since I have anxiety as well and i know its not easy to talk about. The way you talk to us is so comforting and i truly love you for that, like you cure bad days with one smile.
thank you for just being you matt <3
Bro you funny
smiling the whole time watching this. we love you matt
oml I'm so proud of him like I feel like, I mean idk cause I'm not him, but i feel like that was probably hard for him to like drive there and film a whole video by himself but it made my entire day and his editing is so funny i can't ❤
I really do hope you know that you’re anxiety isn’t your whole personality. Because as a person with anxiety, I remember constantly having to remind myself that it’s not just the person who I am. And you are not boring at all. The way you’re comforting people, say the funniest yet perfect things, and still manage to be extremely humble amazes me.
Listening to Matt talking is soo comforting and so so sweet, like he’s doing very well in this video and he def needs to doubt himself less
Lol he was blowing every thing ahahahahha
i’m sorry but him yelling into the camera at the last second made me laugh so hard
love getting to hear you talk and open up/be unfiltered ab stuff. you’re so sweeeet and i really loved the q&a part of the video :-)) you’re really not boring at all im excited for future videos
“DAMN I WAS BLOWING EVERYTHING” 😭😭
I love how Matt added the subtitles every now and then it's funny with the instruments 🤣
I think it's great that you're taking this step and becoming more independent. Also, it would be fun to see what songs you like at the moment and why, you could post monthly videos with songs you jammed the most in that month. By the way, I think it's great that you're going to talk about your anxiety, as someone who has struggled with it since 13 years old (I'm now 17), I'm really looking forward to hearing about your experience with it. ❤️
W video 🗣
t amo tanto, please keep doing this. I love you so much
When he said he boring without his brothers , just proved to me how deep there bond goes
bro is so relatable it’s crazy
THE ELEVATOR MUSIC💀😭
can we get gaming content? would love to see some let's plays. you also have enough subs to livestream on youtube <3
love u matt <3
i also have really bad anxiety. i talk about it to ppl j to get reassurance that i’m not crazy so it’d be nice to hear someone else’s story
I am already starting to love this, even though this is just your first video!! I used to play the violin and when you brought up  instruments, it made me think if that time in middle school when I would just drag the stick thingy in the strings without making any noise at my concerts. I was such a weenie 😭🤣
I love your editing! 😂 this was a very fun video 🫶👍
i love when u scream at the end LMAO and this video was so good! Keep up the good work matt I’m proud of u 🤍🤍
Everything made sense Matt don’t worry😁❤️
Ur personality is really one of a kind being awkward and bland SO WHAT (not admitting you are but even if you are it’s cute) and I could just watch you sit there and do nothing or eat a mcflurry and it would be entertaining😩
You should all use a different Elmer song on your personal channels! That would be so cool!!
you're not boring matt, you have an universe inside that brain and even though you're reserved we can see it🌼 quiet people get other quiet people
Loved this vid so much. Ik exactly what he means w the good memories ahaha
I’m so proud of him for doing this. We love u Matt❤️💞
Love this video, KEEP DOING MORE<3
I LOVE THE EDITING
15:42 the half second silence💀💀💀💀
I’m now going to drink pickle juice just to spite you
I feel on a personal level that doing things alone is scary. I used to have siblings and we all moved away and to this day I’m still coping being the only one. Some things are just hard to do alone.
i really like this video. Like I think matt is extremely good at it and much better than he thinks. His editing actually made me laugh out loud. Also clothing hauls, anxiety videos, and jewelry or just like life updates are great vids
i’m really proud of matt for taking this step and doing his thing, and just a reminder ur not boring at all and i genuinely felt great watching this video, cause i can relate to a lot of things u mentioned. Also i love the editing style. you’re doing amazing bro keep going 💛💛
I feel like you don't talk about yourself that much, and i think these type of videos are gonna help you grow and maybe become more open to people, you are an amazing person and we love you so much<3
this was cute 😊
i truly love how matt is very comfortable to open about his anxiety im so proud of you matt you deserve so much more i hope you can do more personally videos in the future <33
I love you. I just love you. And I love this video. You’re amazing ❤️❤️❤️
i love these types of videos i would love more
thank u for starting ur own channel excited to see more of u🤍
Omg, I loved this video so much! I’m really excited for you to keep uploading on this channel, you’re a very relatable person lol! You’re doing great btw, you’re an amazing youtuber with and without your brothers! 💗 I love hearing what you have to say! Im looking forward to your next upload, and take your time and just do what makes you happy! 💗💗💗💗 love you lots! 🥰
You should try to film a video of you decorating your room or like fixing it up
The little word inserts are killing me love this channel btw❤️❤️
Omg hi
13:42 LMAOOOO STOPP
Matt we are so proud of you for talking about anxiety and I can't wait to see how far your channel will go. I think you're gonna be great and slowly you'll get the hang of talking to the camera all by yourself. I already know I'm gonna love your videos. ❤🖤
I was a cello wiz in school aswell. Master of the air bow
It makes me so sad how he always doubts himself and always calls himself boring. Trust me if you ask any fan they would say you aren’t boring. Just bc you’re “not” as energetic and “entertaining” as Nick and Chris doesn’t mean you’re boring. You’re way more than boring. You are you and that’s all we want. We all like you just as you are even if you think you’re “boring”.
you should do a video answering dms. so read the dm then reply. yes, everyone gets the reply but the message may apply to a lot of your followers. it would be interactive with followers and will touch on many different topics.
Hearing Matt talk about his anxiety is so comforting considering that it's not talked about a lot on social media
honestly, matt talking about his anxiety makes me feel so much less alone. anxiety is very draining and frustrating to deal with on a daily basis 😕 definitely looking forward to more creators shedding light on this, a rarely discussed topic!
it’s kinda crazy to think about how you have the same mannerisms as nick and chris and vice versa but at the same time you don’t like most times i know you are matt and you’re your own person but then there are these small moments where i recognize nick or chris in you bc of the shared mannerisms and it blows my mind for a second
i think “drive with me” videos would be great for you and you could just talk about random things that come into your mind or ask people on your instagram story what they are interested in
i love this for you matt. it would be awesome to hear u talk about anxiety and just a q&a i love you matt i’m so excited for you ❤️
i love this video sm. I love this topic and I love you speaking about anxiety!
this editing style slays king
I totally understand what he’s feeling with the attachment thing, I also have a twin and something it’s kinda hard to stay alone ~ we can do ittt hah
i’m so happy that matt has his own channel and that he can talk freely about his anxiety
Finally Matt not getting interrupted haha
“damn i was blowing everything”😭
matt’s voice is so soothing in my opinion
emma chamberlain left youtube months ago & I lost my comfort person. I love all three of the boys but Matt is my forever favorite & being able to hear him and only him and just listen to him ramble is my new favorite thing. Matt has become my new comfort person ❤️
BRING BACK COOL CLOTHS THAT I BUY! I love those! I love listening to you talk about cloths or just things that you like
just this video made me so happy, hearing matt’s voice is so calming and his energy makes me truly happy/entertained. im so glad he made a personal channel so he can be himself and not be interrupted and let his thoughts flow freely. i love matt sm💙
matty b i loved the outro sm that scream really moved me on a spiritual level 😪💗
It really hurts my heart when he says he’s boring, he really needs to know how many people he impacts. I love Matt with all my heart and I really can not wait to see him grow as an individual, and learn so much more about him. As hard and as awkward as it is to do these things without his brothers , I think it will be such a fun experience for him. I can not wait to watch more. You go Matt ❤️
KING
the editing is so cute in this
I love everything about this video honestly
i honestly didnt expect u to be the first to post on ur personal yt channel. proud of u for editing it urself 🫶
really proud of you matt <3
MATT YOU NEED AN INTRO IT WOULD BE SO COOL
I love seeing Matt get out on his own because I think he can find more of himself and have some fun! I’m so proud of you Matt🫶 also you’re not boring!!! You’re amazing
Please talk about your mental health and anxiety if you’re comfortable
THE MUSIC KILLS ME.

Just so you know MATTHEW. you aren’t boring to us, i genuinely enjoy these types of videos, you’re talking and im listening. You are VERY entertaining and i absolutely love your editing style!
Matt I literally am so so proud of you and love you so much. You make me feel so safe and everything. I appreciate you so much❤️
"yea I'm just hoping to grow.. more together as we... live.. our lives for.. the rest of when we... live. -Matthew Sturniolo 2022
I love Matt talking this much and how far he has come in just life in general warms my heart. He’s an amazing person and I love getting to know him more as a person
i love this. the editing made me laugh multiple times
Honestly love Matt. It’s so sad that he’s so hard on himself. I way prefer a more chill style of vid like this. Love all the boys but Chris can nick can be a lot
I love editor Matt
so proud of you for this matt
Yeah Matt we’re not depending you just do you and take your time and post whenever you feel like and whenever you do we’ll watch and love it❤️
I love the occasional elevator music
i love this human so much
You’re actually nailing this thing by yourself Matthew, feels good that we get a chance to know you by yourself. AND you get to talk alot more and thats positive! you’ve got this
U can call it anxiety talk with matt
loving the scream at the end tbh
Loved the video Matt!!! Keep going we love you
this video literally brought the biggest smile to my face keep doing you matt we love you.
Honestly I 100% understand what you're saying about the difference between being together with your siblings and doing something verses when you're alone. I have 4 sister's and I'm the middle child and I relate to so much of what you said about in the majority of what was in this video. All of my sisters are loud and outgoing and it's the same situation where it's like I get interrupted and talked over so I end up just not saying much, so when I've been by myself I've made car videos before years ago cuz I was doing it to be in contact with a friend of mine who lived in another state. It was really strange to be able to have my voice be the only one out loud. I also have it where I end up being so distracted I don't finish my thoughts. Some people are very excited and outgoing so they're ready to just let their thoughts and ideas out and be heard, so when you have a lot of interruptions you tend to have more thoughts just kept in your head and speaking them just feels really strange and almost abnormal to do so. I feel a lot of the times being distracted is a way of you just repeating the patterns of being interrupted if that makes sense. I really enjoyed this video and I am so happy to see you have a channel to really just let the rest of us understand and get to know who you are. I can't wait for whenever you come out with another video because I will definitely watch it consistently like I do with your main Channel with your brothers. I can't wait for the next one ❤️
Awe i love this so much. I love him talking so much. He is so so calming and just him talking is so entertaining and fun. I cant wait for more videos.
i love listening to matt talk about his anxiety and things going on with him, it’s super comforting and he definitely slayed for this being his first video. I CANT WAIT FOR FUTURE VIDEOS🤍
We loveee this <3333333 we need more :)
I could hear you talk all day and I not get bored! 🤍
no sir you cannot change it. this is great. this is you, this is how you are alone. i love how you're doing this for you to be better as yourself and i think that's awesome. i love that you're putting your personal self and health out there and i'm so proud and grateful because a lot of people including myself struggle with those things. thank you for being you and i'll see you in the next video <3
king
Love the solo content, love that he has a chance to get opinions out without interruptions. Still love the triplet content tho obvi

It’s comforting
i love this
as someone who struggles with anxiety and the feeling that it’s never really going to get better, this was so refreshing and comforting to watch! such a beautiful video matt, and your editing is 10/10 x
i love you
the way i completely understand the feeling of being so attached to your sibling & feeling so alone when they aren’t with you.
I absolutely loved this🥰 Matt is genuinely funny and I don’t think it’s recognized enough on the group channel but yeah👍🏻😊…….         Also the “pickles never did anything to me🤷🏻” at 14:34 absolutely killed me😂😂😂
Omg I loved this- not as chaotic as the normal channel so I just got to sit here and listen while I did my hw <3
i love how matt is soooo open to us and is not scared to talk about his anxiety and helps make us feel better about everything in life <3
:]
i love how matt is soooo open to us and is not scared to talk about his anxiety and helps make us feel better about everything in life ❤️

The scream at the end honestly scared me
We need to hear you play a chelio
You did so good the video is amazing I'm sooo proud of you!!!! Can't wait and I'm so excited for other videos <3
This is great Matt, please continue with personal videos would love to see more from you. Thank you for talking about anxiety it’s definitely not talked about enough.
I love to see your collection of your ransom clothing and some of your fave tops
omg matt! this is very good, and I really like your editing style, seems like you’re talking with yourself, it’s funny ahahah clothing hauls is a really good idea!!! and of course I would love some talks about anxiety, your mental health, …etc keep going, we’re here to support you! 🫶🏻
This so soo good and the editing 😚 so goooood
tbh go you matt. you don’t sound like an idiot either and u make sense to a strong amount of us. this shit will be fun and ur doing great, also talking abt anxiety helps me sm and so so many other people so tysm. hashtag u rock‼️
when matt talks about his anxiety it makes me so proud of him because I have struggled with anxiety for a long time and still do. he has helped me be so much more comfortable with my anxiety. i love and appreciate you matt.
ugh matt, you mean so much to me. I’m looking forward to your personal journey. I’ll be here supporting you the whole way <33
He seems like the type of person you could come out to with ease
I am so glad your going to talk about your anxiety it  is genuinely so comforting.
seeing you just sit down and chatting with us is really great however you decide to use this channel ill be here for it. i really enjoyed this video tho. i hope you upload more frequently and see where it goes from there. and i feel like if you do coping with anxiety videos is going to help a lot of people who are dealing with it. i don't have anxiety but my best friend does and i want to do how i can help her deal with it if a situation ever occurs. hope anyone reading this or matt ( i doubt it) has a great week<33
i love it sm when people unlock a memory
i personally think that the “this is gonna be painful” intro is great and you should keep it.
I did just miraculously get here just through you. Lmao randomly got recommended but glad I found this channel and the other one!
the cuts to matt editing are reminding me of the lift music intermission during the clyde live and i adore that
We love you matty
i have the same kinda anxiety, im usually chill but sometimes little (or big) things bother me for a bit... id really love to see u talk about mental health and stuff:) (and also see ur clothes cuz i love ur style so much) LOVE YA
I love listening to you talk, Matt! I think its great, that you want to talk more about mental health and your anxiety, its honestly really comforting. Can't wait to see more videos like this❤
loved the editing matt 😁💪🏽
Matt, HONEST TO GOD I LOVED THIS VIDEO…. Is very personal and genuine and I think you did great!! I’m sure the awkwardness will fade as you do it more but as for right now it was a GREAT start❤️so exited for ur next video ❤️
I really enjoyed this video, even though it was as chaotic as the group channel videos it was still funny. Its interesting to see how you act the same but different in your personal  channel. I'm excited to see how far you get with this and I hope you also enjoy recording. I'm ready to watch every video you post whether it be you just talking or playing games, whatever I know many of us will enjoy. Take care of yourself and your well being, do what makes you comfortable when doing these videos! can't wait for future videos! I love you and stay safe ❤
i feel so connected to him
crying for you baby
I loved this! Matt, you are not boring I was highly entertained. Keep on doing what you love!
18 minutes of matt sturniolo speaking without being interrupted WE HERE FOR IT
trust me this wasn’t boring at all and I love your editing <3
Matt I think it would be good for you to make more videos on your personal channel because you'll be able to learn to be okay when your brothers aren't always with you
matt posting on his personal channel for the first time = day instantly made
i loved this video, it’s truly heart warming to see him by himself and not getting interrupted. Trust me i love chris and nick, but seeing matt by himself and being able to explain things and finish sentences, is pure gold. i can’t wait for more of his videos ❤️
Matt. Talking abt the recorder 😭😭✋
pickle juice is good
“inthernet”
Also just hearing you talk completely normally is so comforting for some reason Matt so don't worry about anything, this channel should just be for you and your mental health
You could post a video of you sitting in silence for an hour and we’d get it trending
I smiled so hard
THIS VIDEO TURNED OUT SO WELL. HOPING TO SEE MORE FROM YOU!!!!!💗💗💗💗💗💗
I love how your so open about your anxiety and I’m so proud of you for filming a video and you have a huge impact on my life I love you so much ♥️♥️♥️
14:20 i totally get u, they be unlocking memories for me and i love it
12:57 that’s so funny I love him
bro this is so funny for no reason i love you so much!
the elevator music out of nowhere is just amazing haha
you guys should like each do your own like podcast thing on like spotify and apple music etc. where like you each do your own episodes and talk ab random shit
Post whatever you want and we’ll eat it up
Matt you are so amazing and ilysm
i listened to this like a podcast on the way to school and it was great 💯
okay but the pauses with the elevator music is actually funny 😭
I 100% understand how u feel when ur not doing things with Nick and Chris. my whole life and source of entertainment relies on my siblings/friends and I'm such a bland person without them. me on my own just doesn't hit the same as me with friends
you should like rank different kids meals lol!!!
i love you matt i’m so proud of you 🫶🏻
MATT CAN YOU PLEASE DO VIDEO GAMES
MY BESTIE WAS THE PERSON THAT SAID THE INSTRUMENT PART HAH 💞 ily!!!
listening to matt just talking is so calming he makes me feel so safe <3
Personally I think you did great, it was fun interesting, and something new. One thing you could work on is not over thinking every thing you say because your doing just fine.
“Once a month if ur lucky” okay slay exclusive channel
PLEASE KEEP THE LITTLE CUT SCENES THEYRE SO FUNNY
we luv u
the editing was so funny 😭 keep doing what you're doing bro
13:23 AHAHA
THIS WAS SO GOOD MATT SLAY
when u said internet you sounded like grr LMAO
i love this editing pls
these personal channel's are so amazing like I want to learn more about each one of you
you have 69k subs lol
Matt that was soo good!!! Something about your energy is so relaxing. I would definitely love videos about anxiety and coping with anxiety. I’ve had anxiety for as long as I can remember and just now at 23 I’m learning some ways to cope. I want to start/try therapy but I don’t know where yo start and I’m lowkey nervous of what will get brought up from my childhood. I truly appreciate and admire how open you are with talking about it💙
bless him hes so cute 😭
Hii Matt
seeing you three bounce off of one another is so cool, you do look a little lost without Nick and Chris but it’s nice to see you all be your individual selves too! i also love how half of this video was you just convincing us that you’re okay, hope you are <3
matt, i can’t wait to see where your account goes! 10/10! also i love the editing! the little pop ups are the bestttt 😂
Matt you did perf with editing and perfect at talking. I have similar problems with like talking and getting nervous so thank you for this. It'd also be really nice to hear you talk about your anxiety like you said
the in between edited texts are KILLING me lmaoooo
this is my new comfort video. Can’t explain how much i love this :’)
PLS DO GAMING VIDEOS OR TROLL PEOPLE ON VIDEO GAMES THAY WOULDBE SO FUNNY
Tbh Matt, I lowkey think Emma Chamberlain's videos were/are boring, and people praise her. So you'll be great. But I think it will be really cool to get to know you and hang out with you without Nick and Chris.
i <3 you matt
Matt I love you so much. I hope you continue to post on here. Would love to see and hear more from you.
My crush
i feel so connected w you it comforts me sm
I hate when he says he’s boring because I totally disagree he had my attention the whole video and I love that he made his own channel and is trying something new. Great video!!
DO A DRIVE WITH ME / CARPOOL KARAOKE FT CHRIS AND NICK song and rate ur playlist
I’m eating this up
I love how we get to see a little of Matt’s personality and I started laughing so much when the edit pop ups came up!!💟
matt I know you said not to  depend on your videos ,but I think I have to.
Hi Matt. I just wanna say that I am so proud of u. Thank u for sharing about your anxiety. I understand this so much
YEAHHHHH
KISS THE CAMERA FOR THE OUTRO LIKE GOOD OLE TIMES BUDDY
i have that same thing about my hands feeling heavy with rings
gaming videos would be so entertaining!!
WE. DO. NOT. DESERVE. MATTHEW. BERNARD. STURNIOLO. no but fr he is the most precious person on earth
matt he all love and adore you!!❤️❤️
MATTTTT KISS THE CAM FOR YOUR OUTRO BOI
Yes matt
matt reminds me so much of myself. matt i hope you know how much you mean to me.
UGH I LITERALLY LOVE HEARING YOU BE ABLE TO TALK SO MUCH!!! like i love nick and chris but i always want to hear what you have to say and they are always interrupting you so it's really nice hearing what you have to say i love you! 🫶🏻
It’s so nice to have a influencer that opens up and talks about mental health, it’ll definitely help the people that watch and look up to Matt. I’m so proud and excited to see you progress on this channel!
I live how he has a youtube channel and not with nick and chris lf course i love all if them but now he can talk and he doesn’t have to be like quiet
I like the clothing haul ideas. I think that if u incorporate videos like that with videos talking about ur anxiety would be a good mix. It would give us a completely different outlook & it just be good.
im proud of you for driving alone today regardless of ur anxiety and i love how open u are about ur anxiety it helps alot of people including me <3 keep it up, love u
i don’t know how this would be possible, but i just liked matt a little bit more. the fact that he’s so open abt talking about his anxiety literally helps me calm down. ngl i’m probably gonna watch this video many times in the future.
Matt you don't have to doubt yourself so much, trust me there a lot of people who love your videos<3
love this Matt, i feel like we can get to know you a bit more on your own :) just do whatever you feel like doing on this channel, no pressure whatsoever. ily!
Great first video… I’m looking forward to future content… and I’m glad you felt comfortable enough to be yourself and open up 🤙🤙🤙
Honestly, anyone who knows Matt irl is so lucky for having such a sweet and kind soul in their lives and i hope that they appreciate it and never hurt him in any way possible. And Matt, i hope you know we appreciate your honesty and openness so so much and it means so much to so many people, life changing even! I hope you have an amazing rest of your day and that you always remember to be kind to yourself. I love you so much.
loved the editing bestie
how is this channel already my new comfort one
Make a video decorating that dungeon of yours!
you are perfection!!!! i can’t believe how far you’ve came!! you can do this matt, i believe in you!! ur not boring you’ve helped a lot of us!!! it’s so good to not see u get interrupted every 2mins (no hate to nick and chris)
I love you matt💜
ok but i feel like the sturniolo triplets videos are always so chaotic and matt just talking the whole time has me feeling so calm because sometimes i’m like shaking bc there is so much going on even though it’s so funny love you matt <3
matt if you knew how much you helped me with MY anxiety seriously thank you so much
Hiii Matt
Love you Matt
i loved every second of this video, i enjoyed how honest you were about feeling awkward being alone etc. and im proud of you for taking the first steps :) i think this will be a good experience for you to learn some things about yourself just like you said 💟 looking forward to more!
i feel like your personal channel is going to help you get out of your comfort zone in a good way and i really hope your doing good
This is such a beautiful change hearing you talk and sharing everything without being interrupted. Very proud of you<3 Also the editing Matt 10/10 👌

matt is literally me when i am without my siblings . But it was so satisfying to listen to. No matter what you post i will still watch it 😆. Have a great everyone who sees this🤍
now why did he answer that sidekick question so quick 😭 my man had that answer on LOCK
I think this is a great first video
i loved it Matt we're here to support ya and ur content... i think anxiety content is super cool tho
I could hear Matt talking for hours and never get tired. His voice, the way he talks, everything is just perfect. This man is perfect in every single way possible.
He looks so much like nick in this video lol
hearing u talk is healing
I don’t think Matt knows that he’s actually very entertaining and I could listen to him talk for hours. When he was on the cuffboys podcast he was my favorite one to listen to him sharing his experiences with his anxiety and just funny shit he does. I love your first video Matt and I’m so excited for future videos!
Sooooo proud of u ngl ilysm❤️❤️❤️❤️
Definitely loving Matt’s editing skills
matt’s editing is absolutely hilarious bro
13:23 yo 😧😟😟
THE EDITING IS TAKING ME OUT
No because if Matt had any feeling that he shouldn’t post this his is ABSOLUTELY WRONG this is amazing idk y I like this sm but omg ily him sm
love it
you dont sound like an idiot matt dw 👍🏻
12:23 yo 😟😟😟
Honestly love seeing you just being you just be yourself in your videos and your good 😊
your the cutest omg
Matt’s one of the most genuine people I have ever seen. The way hes so open to talk about his struggles really makes me and so many people more comfortable in our own. It doesnt matter if these are a once a month thing, that fact you’re taking time out of your day alone to film these and edit these are enough.   It’ll be amazing to see your transformation as a person through these videos as you grow as a human.   You’re doing amazing Matt, dont ever think you’re boring because you arent. And even if you were, being boring is okay. We dont need to live these exciting lives to be entertaining. Just seeing you do you is entertaining enough ❤️  Good luck in all your endeavours ❤️ And congratulations on your first ever personal video!!!!
This is going to be a great channel! I Already felt comforted and I am looking forward to the anxiety talks. Also you are very funny, those pink card breaks are so funny!! Keep those 🤣☺️!! So glad you took the first step can't wait to see more videos from your personal channel🙌🏿😊❤️
"I was a wizard at the cello" 😭
MATT PLEASE I LOVE THIS
I'm excited for the videos that are to come! I also hope you enjoyed your Snapple, Reeces, and skittles :) #slay
I was literally smiling the entire time watching this video! I love u so much and I can’t wait to see more videos. Don’t feel pressured to post here all the time, as long as u do u, I’m happy 😁 And thank you for opening up about ur anxiety and just what u go through cause I know it’s gonna help so many people including me. I pray for ur success and ur brothers as well. I love u so much and keep doing what u love 🥰❤️🤟🏼
You’re mad fun to listen to when you’re alone. If you could elaborate on your anxiety struggles, then that would be really appreciated. Keep it up!
I have anxiety too and I think having someone I love so much to talk about will help me a lot. I'm excited about it
matt talking about his anxiety made me so much more comofortable kowing that im not the only one with bad anxiety, love u and also im very proud of u <3
THE EDITING LMFAO
Aaaa l love your first video Matt, we love whatever you post. That “subscribe baby” got me so surprised haha nah but for real you’re helping me and others by for example with my anxiety when you posted this because I got so calm and my anxiety got away then. We love you Matt and don’t stress about posting. Post whenever you want, it’s your choice. We are just happy when you are :)
14:16 yeahhhhh i totally get you, i love that feeling
I'm so happy with your personal channel. I think it will be too good for you to talk to us about more serious matters. I love you and keep it up 🤍
matt this video was 10/10!!!!!!!!
this is my favorite video in the history of youtube
LMFAO THE INSTRUMENT TALK😭😭
Matt talking about his anxiety is so helpful and that brings me so much comfort and I'm so proud of him, OMG you have no idea ❤️
being in a rough place with my mental health and anxiety and depressed being at an all time high, i just know i'm gonna find so much comfort in this video. matt is such a comfort person and helps me so much with feeling less alone with how i'm feeling. i hope you know how much of an impact you make on so many peoples lives. you have saved my life over and over when i was at my lowest. you make my darkest days brighter. i literally love you so much and cannot wait to watch this video <3
Matt saying hes boring alone as a whole makes me so sad because hes so interesting and genuine. im so excited for ur upcoming content, love you ❤

love this! matt’s editing is so simple yet so affective and funny. i think this will really help him grow and find out who he is individually. he’s not boring he’s actually hilarious and is very real and relatable and i love that. keep doing you matt!
I WAS WAITING FOR THISSS
I liked the vibe to this video and how chill it was. It’s like you’re just having a conversation and it’s really nice
🧡🧡🧡
just listening to matt speak is my form of therapy. love him sm
Go Matt bro 🥹
Matt your youtube is never gonna be boring, I simply enjoy your presence.😂 Even if it's you just sitting there doing nothing. If you think you're boring then we all are.
I just love Matt so much I was legit about to start crying like 17 times. You bring me so much comfort and your voice is so relaxing. I feel like a video of Matt talking about his anxiety will be my comfort video for when I’m sad or anxious and need to relax bc you literally one of my favorite people rn and this video was amazing can’t wait for your next video. I hope you’re doing well matty b, have a good day❤️
just listening matt talking is so chill and calm i love it <33 (also very proud of him for talking about his anxiety, normalizing it and making us feel better about our own anxiety is very appreciated. ty matt <3)
i just know the scream at the end had to be weird doing it alone
matt!! :)))
yes!! talking about anxiety is really important! i too have a lot of anxiety and i deal with it everyday and i hate it. i feel like when someone in the creator world talks about it i feel seen, so you should definitely do it!
im so proud of matt omg 🥹
you say u think Ur boring but honestly, whatever you post would be enterteinning. Thank you for being so open and real to us it Makes me feel like u trust us 💕💕really apreciate it
matt: attacking pickle juice me: drinking pickle juice😬😃 what a coincidence😂 ily matt🫶🏽
“pickles never did anything to me”😭
i personally loved just simply hearing u talk abt whatever, since it kinda feels like ur the one that does it the least on the group channel :)
there's about to be so many sad edits from this video on tiktok im not ready
He gets interrupted so much i never realized how soothing his voice is ( i swear i am not trying to be weird) ❤️
Matt saying *THANK YOU GOD, AMEN* @ 15:31, when answering the question “If he’d be a different person if he didn’t start youtube” is the funniest shit ever 😭💀🤚🏽
i love hearing him speak this much. im excited for more videos of just him and then nick and chris's personal channels.
I hope you know how thankful I am that you are so open about mental health and anxiety bc it really does help how I feel about having it and it makes me accept it more
listening to matt talk by himself is so calming.
WHEN MATT EDITS IN THE STUFF ABOUT BLOWING THE INSTRUMENT HE PLAYED💀 + THE ENDING IT AMAZING
idk why but i feel like we're getting a variation of male emma chamberlain from matt and i love it
I LOVE MATT SM!!! <33
Okay but honestly your video feels like a face time with friends and I love it 🤍
the editing got me laughing a lot. loved it
matt you’re 26k subs from getting you’re own youtube plaque already
my twin sister and i have this problem where, since we have the same friends, we will tell them the exact same things. So they will be there getting told the same things soooo many times.
It was really weird at first with Nick and Chris gone but then it was really comforting listening Matt talking about himself also mentioning anxiety which is something that I struggle with but I really liked this video
Do moreeee
Matt’s voice is so soothing. We appreciate you Matt!
agree with the car thing, i am always driving other people it feels weird to drive on my own
Matt you are one of the funniest persons without even trying I've ever seen in my whole life I love you
i loved this video AND ON A MONDAY 😩 i really needed this after school. i ❤️ ur editing
This felt like the most comforting facetime and i love it 💓
the editing comments are amazing I love them
It is very strange without Nick and Chris but this video was so lovely, and well put together. And Matt is sweetest human ever which makes it ten times better. I love how he seems confident to talk about his anxiety and stress, it helps a lot of people out doing that, especially when your a kind person. A few of my friends are already saying that this kinda feels like a safe place to just let loose, I totally agree. He’s helped more people then he knows. I hope that he’s doing good as well. Matt, Nick and Chris are everything to me. Keep up the good work guys. I couldn’t care less if Matt posted once a month or once a year though, just the fact that he did post and he cares for a lot of people is heartwarming ❤️❤️
just know that we’ll watch your videos as long as you feel confortable and happy doing them. it’s up to you Matt<3
The instrument segment had me dying the way it just kept going and his editing notes just kept appearing as he obliviously continued. Im looking forward to seeing the anxiety videos it’s comforting seeing someone being so open <3
woooooooo
ur editing genuinely made me LOL
u have made such an impact on my life matt. u taking ab anxiety has helped me sm pls make more of these 💕💕
"you get em' when you get em' and ya don't get em' when you don't get em'." - matt sturniolo 2022 🤝
my mental health and anxiety is so f bad
Matt thinks he's boring while in fact he's so interesting broooo
i haven’t heard matt talk for this long and i love it! like just him talking about about himself and his anxiety.
I love this <3
i love this
awe
I LOVE YOU MATT
Matt should kiss the camera for the outro
this brought a smile on my face seeing matt talk just himself. i’ve struggled sm with anxiety and hearing you talk about ur thoughts and q and a’s i literally love u sm.
I'm happy he's happy
I’ve been waiting for him to upload since they announced their own personal channels! Can’t wait to watch like rn
I love how Chris and nick are not there to interrupt you, but instead you're interrupting yourself with the pop-ups and elevator music. I'm honestly here for it 🙇‍♀️🙇‍♀️
I'm so proud of you matt❤‍🩹
Pitchers
i’m cackling at your little comments in pink, i love this sm😭😭
When Matt said "in the least pick me way possible" just made me realize that people that get called a "pick me" a,east mist of the barest trying to be one. Most if the people that call them "pick me " just say it to make themselves feel better about themselves. I know this sounds like I'm trying to make a paragraph just to make a paragraph about something stupid, I'm not trying to make something stupid I just wish a "pick me" never existed. So may people including me get called a pick me for no absolute reason, and it  makes people feel bad about themselves. Just like me I wanted to change my whole personality because all of my friends called me a "pick me" and i hope someone can read this and relate to me NOT IN A PICK ME WAY.
the editing with the little music intervals and commentary are so funny 😂  also so proud of you Matt! Especially for talking up about your anxiety. Plus you're not boring even if you think you are!
ilysm
You did really great🤍
this may be not good because of your anxiety. but itd be fun to do like a fast food type video !!
in your next video can you do prank callsss plss <3
YUHHHH!!!!
MATTTTTT
it was so cute when matt said he has attachment issues when he’s not with nick and chris. i love him sm he’s so cute n i love how he talked about his anxiety it helps me a lot too. love him sm
i love the thought of you talking about coping with anxiety. i struggle with the same thing and i hope you can shed some light on it . give me some tips yk. <3
me everytime matt was stressing out : Its okay matt take ur time
I’m so excited for this channel and future videos! I’ve had bad anxiety for years now and I’ve never related to any creator I watch on Youtube so the fact that you are open about your anxiety is really huge and is going to help me and a lot of other people❤️❤️ Thank you so so much Matt❤️❤️❤️
That “subscribe baby” really got me <333
can we all just take a moment to appreciate how proud we are of matt. having to deal with hate and having anxiety must be one of the toughest things ever, matt just being himself has helped so many people. him being openly honest about his anxiety will help others do the same. we love you matt❤️
you’re going to do amazing things ❤️ so glad someone is openly talking about anxiety and mental health in general. keep it up!!
Over 70k subscribers in under an hour. Nice.
dude you don't know how glad and excited i am to hear abt the anixety talk 😭 i've been suffering w sm anxiety and it's heightened so much since the pandemic started that it's actually prevented me from going to school-- and so i'm v glad that you (and a lot of people who are commenting) can share their stories as it makes me feel less alone to know that there are other people in this world struggling the same way i am. hopefully this is also a learning curve for me LOL i rly wanna get my anxiety under control in the next few months and i hope everyone here can achieve the same thing <3.
THE ELEVATOR MUSIC EDITING i love it i cant with it
I’m weeping
MATT ILY
TE AAAAAMOOOOO TE AMO TANTO
Anxiety is a real thing and I definitely deal with it A LOT, so hearing you talk about things like that can really help people <3
i was having a really bad day and listening to matt just made it totally better, you’re so entertaining and u have the ability to make everyone happy! so proud of u❤️
you did  great, keep going 💘
Clothing haul definitely
Matt you make me feel so safe, I hope one day I can tell you this in person and thank you. I have anxiety too so I’d like to see your like opinion or thoughts about it, to maybe help me through. Love you!
MATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT THIS IS AMAZINGGGG
the way i stopped what i was doing and watched this entire thing without moving- i was thoroughly entertained just hearing him talk istg
I miraculously got here literally
The fist video was so good! So excited for more in the future! As someone with anxiety  Talking about coping with anxiety and different ways to help with it helps me a lot! Thank you for being someone who is safe and a comfort person to come to when we need it!
MATTY BOYYYYYY
It’s so awesome to see how people open up about there anxiety and stuff. It is probably really difficult and it just makes my day to see people doing that! So proud of Matt for making the channel!🤍
Despite your overthinking this was an amazing video, talking about anxiety is a great idea, clothing haul is a GREAT idea. And this proved that your not as boring as you think you are. I loved this video💗💗
nah nah nah I absolutely love this
you don't understand how awesome u are!! we don't deserve you <33
you're doing great matt.
Matt we love you so much, don’t doubt yourself at all we are so proud of you <33
Is it just me or is it so weird and unusual that Matt isn’t getting interrupted by chis and nick🥴
MY COMFORT PERSON
you should do prank calls!!!
this is amazing. you’re amazing matt <3
Matt looks in the mirror and sees someone *locks door *
hello
matt, you are not a boring individual! i laughed out loud multiple times while watching this! i'm looking forward as to what's to come and am soooo proud of you!!! <3
Bro your editing is literally hilarious I was smiling this whole video you’re not boring one bit <3333
very excited to see what content you post when you find out what works for you! <3
i am so in love with this boy
matt you are such a sweetheart
honestly, you guys reached a level of recognition and connection with your fans that we are really interested in your personality alone so people may enjoy your content regardless if its necessarily "entertaining", like these sit down talks of you just being yourself is enough, so don't feel like you have to perform or maintain a certain standard, cuz I honestly think your more entertaining than you think in your own way <3
Matt don’t say you are boring because you are not! We love you just the way you are❤️❤️❤️
I love calm videos like these. we don't get to listen to you talk that much on the other channel so it's interesting, even if you don't think it is. also, the clothing hauls on TikTok were so fun to watch, it would be way cooler here on youtube.
I love all the ideas
YESSIR I love this vid, the editing is great and I’m so here for this concept. More Matt content please!! <3
this sounds so cliche but i’m so proud of you for uploading this video!! i love everything about it, the editing, the vibes, it felt like i was just listening to a friend talk, which is very comforting. this is the type of content i love. as for future content, talking about anxiety / mental health i feel like will be so helpful to us fans who deal with it as well everyday  and even for you. i think it’s a great idea and i’m happy your comfortable enough to share it with us. i appreciate you taking the time to do this and i’m so excited to see where this channel goes <3
matt i love you
i love this
I love this so much
Loved getting to see you as a person and not as a triplet, great video Matt :)
I love youuuuuu
What was that noise that he made at the end??😂😂😂
I’m so happy we can hear Matt alone, speaking in mind fully with no interruptions😅 he’s actually SO funny and I can’t believe he doesn’t even know that😕
i love the idea of the anxiety talk cause i really can relate also i love this video
I just know these are gonna be my new comfort vids
matt we will watch ANYTHING u post pls believe me
matt i’m so proud of you
Love this so much
The stare into the camera after you said you’d be a sidekick bla bla ahahahhahahaha I CANNOT 😭😭😂
This kid deserves the world❤️‍🩹 I love him so much
THIS VIDEO FR MADE MY DAY! I LOVE U MATT❤
@4:48 - i was apart from my twin for the first time this year, and don’t worry you explained this well, bc that’s the best way to describe how it felt
LOVED THE VID!!!!
matt we’re so proud of you, i hope you get used to this and feel comfortable with doing these videos.  I’m really happy seeing you just talking.💌
I think you talking about your mental health is let others know that their not alone and to see what you struggle and don’t struggle with and also you can share how to cope with it cause me personally I can’t really cope with my anxiety and mine is bad enough that I get rashes. And you can also do some arts and crafts that seems like a Matt thing or share your playlist if you don’t get copy right.
i love you Matt 💞💞
i just finish it!!! i can't wait for a new video next month (hopefully🤞), love u <333
you did great on this video matt!! so proud
matt this was so cute
LMAOOo your cluelessness in the beginning is so funny to me
as someone who has anxiety,this makes me feel so happy to hear that hes gonna talk about this more. love u bro
Love you so much. thank you for always being comfortable about sharing anxiety, it shows how comfortable you are with us <3
This video literally made my day and everything you talked about made sense and was so relatable, don’t pressure yourself that much you’re really funny in general and have a calming presence
you make me feel safe 🤍
16:59-17:10    17:43-18:22  my favourite parts hahah i loved the video 💕💕💕
i love uuuuuu
HAHAHAHA I fuckin love you. You could just sit there for 30 min and I would watch it
i’m so excited to watch this ahhgg
This is amazing! You are amazing!!! Im so excited to watch the videos you may decide to post. You being so open about your anxiety is so inspiring and so brave. Thank you <3 we all appreciate and love you so so much ! I haven’t been watching you, Chris, and Nick for too long, but I’m SO proud of you for stepping out of your comfort zone! The editing is fantastic as was the video
The fact that I relate to him with attachment issues and anxiety is crazy I’m thrilled to see what comes next All the love Matt<33
I actually enjoyed this, Matt did spectacular, it does feel weird with Nick and Chris not interrupting him but it was still enjoyable and I’m proud of him he did great❤️
I genuinely think this is the most heart warming comment section and i hope it stays like that ❤️❤️
Great video 🔥
dude ur not boring !! ur so many peoples favourite ( dont tell nick and chris )
I LOVED THIS
The editing was simple but it added a funny and original touch!!! I really liked the video and I’m excited for the ones coming in the future (especially the one about coping with anxiety because that would help me know how to cope with mine)!!! love you matt 🤍
“DAMN I WAS BLOWING EVERYTHING” had me dying💀
anxiety sucks. its not "aesthetic"
tbh this video was funny 😭 the clips of texts coming up almost every time he talks LMFAOO
I feel so proud and happy watching this! on Christmas last year I went to the hospital due to anxiety, watching this makes me so excited for future content! I love you and the triplets so much! I think content we would all enjoy watching would be eat with me! The last part of this video gave me that idea when you said you were going to eat and drink your snacks and I was like 'aw I wish he kept recording' even if it is silent, it would make me more comfortable eating ! love you!
Matt we love you !!!!!!
omg i’m fangirling i’m so excited for it to just be you 😭🤭 aw
Hearing you talk about anxiety makes me less self conscious about mine and makes me feel like I don’t need to hide anymore or lie about what I feeling so thank you so much Matt💗💗💗
I'm going to watch this video over a thousand times no joke 😃
I loved this video so much it felt like I was on ft with him and the editing makes it that much better
editing was on point that shit was funny af
matt talking about his feelings is so relatable because you can tell he actually wants to talk about them and share with us. you can also tell that he also really wants to help others and it means so much to me cause i also have really bad anxiety even at school. this video literally made me feel so calm and safe which is why i love watching your youtube videos cause they always make me laugh. thank you for what you do and have a good day if you’re reading this matt. 💕🫂
I know he doesn’t believe in Zodiac stuff but like this whole video is giving Virgo rising 😭🤚🏽
i love u matt fheifbiewfdwesi  first video was vibes tbh
3:05 “ya get ‘em when ya get ‘em, and ya don’t get ‘em when ya don’t get ‘em”
i literally love you
The scream at the end 💞💞💗💞 I love Matt smmm
im so happy for this shit, do more when u can pleasee saludos de argentina🇦🇷💘
First of all, so excited for this video and happy I have someone who actually relates to having anxiety. Second, you most DEFINITELY should do clothing hauls and gaming vids. Have some recommendations in mind!!<3
not even going to lie. the whole time i was like “aww”. you’re doing great sweetie LMAO but anyways. i really liked this video and i hope it does help you matt❤️❤️❤️
there’s something really peaceful and calming about being able to just listen to matt speak without crispy and nickel cutting him off every 3 seconds
Thanks for opening up, I can relate a lot. Especially the anxiety talk, I’ve had it my whole life and I’ve been trying so hard to hide it lately. Makes me feel so much safer. Thank you 🫶
Matt this is absolutely the best, you are very much entertaining and i just know this is going to be very awesome. dont worry not posting for a while and honestly I love it here already<3
So proud of you Matt😭
you talked about how boring you are without your brothers and you don't know what to do but at the same time you're the first to post for your personal channel, that's great we love you so much, btw the editing is just spectacular ❤️‍🩹💖
im just so proud.
I can’t wait to see what he does on his own!<3❤️
“pickles never did anything to me, if you don’t like them don’t eat them” idk why but that had me geekin 😂😂 bc i’m a pickle addict😂😂🥹
i’m so proud of u matt!
Jewelry tour sounds awesome!
I also love it when I remember some good memories. It just happened to me earlier at school with some friends and it was sooooo awesome (we’re about to graduate and we got nostalgic, too) :)))
we literally don’t think you’re boring at all i swear
Yesterday I felt like I was starting to have an anxiety attack and no joke first thought was to DM you, never did though but I definitely thought about it.
matt, you’re not boring at all. i’m pretty sure all of us are here because of all 3 of u guys’ channel, and we’re watching that channel because we wanna see more of ALL three of you. if we thought that you were ‘boring’ we wouldn’t even watch the main channel!! we love ur personality & i’m really happy that you have a personal channel as well now. can’t wait to get to know u more <3
MATTTTT, you should do some men's fashion content, maybe some hauls, styling outfits videos, rating different brands, trying new brands etc
yayyyy mattyyyy
I love how he’s opening up abt his anxiety:(❤️
He looks so much like nick in this video 😂
omg matt I love you so much, you legit have no idea how much you have changed my life. your video rocks.
I just loved this. Such a great first video  Def. gonna watch all of the future videos

Matt you are far from boring but😭I really enjoyed this video! Idk why people look down on others who are more calm and not always loud and categorize them as “boring” because I don’t think that true at all and even if it was I think it’s important to have those people or else everyone would b the same :) keep doing what you’re doing ily 🫶🏽
Already rewatching and it’s only been like 30 mins 🫡
The one thing that pissed me off in this video was that you kept saying that you were boring. You are far from boring. I could listen to you talk about what you had for dinner last night and it’d be the most entertaining thing I’ve ever heard. I love you so much please don’t ever think that you are boring bc how ever many fans you have now i can’t even keep track it goes up so much everyday😂 they’re all like me and find you very entertaining that’s kinda why they followed you in the first place. Lots of love🤍
I loved hearing you talk for a whole video !!! More videos like this or more
I love pickles
Matt you did great :)
the struggle in the beginning of the video do trying to figure out how the camera works was such a fucking mood oml   also i’m very excited to see more but i don’t want you to feel rushed into filming so go at your own pace ig :)
pov: you were just excited to see Matt post on his own no matter what it is
I liked the video, it's a new start and I wish you a lot of courage for the future. I hope that making videos alone will make you grow as a person and that you yourself will be surprised at your progress.
hiii matty
gives emma chamberlain vibes :)
i literally love you so much and you and your brothers videos/ content make me so happy.. im so happy to see how far you have come and can’t wait to see how far you will go ❤️
“Damn I was blowing everything” 💀💀
this video just brings me so much comfort, something about matt just talking about whatever just makes me feel safe.
being able to listen to matt and only matt talking is so comforting to me and i can’t wait for more videos. i can already tell the days i see a notification that matt posted will make my night automatically 10 times better.
Matt is literally my favourite person in this universe💜
you pulled a slayjor!
Matt please do your own thing! Because honestly so many people love you for you
It’s so funny hearing Matt actually get to speak. It’s kinda refreshing.
It was nice to see Matt talk for entire video. I’m really glad that you guys are also making your own videos so we can get to know you guys a little more in depth!!!!
Today I woke up and the first thing I saw today was that your video was being posted today and it made my day. I just finished watching and you've made my day even more. You're not boring and I'm really excited for some more videos, and the ideas you said. love you :)
i really really really hope you know how much we love and appreciate you for just being you ❤️
thank you god, AMEN
setting my timer once a month for this
matt for your outro you should kiss the camera like you use to do instead of scream and leave the screaming for the group acc
Matt I’m begging you, please bring back the camera kisses for your personal channel
im excited for this
love you papa matt
we love you matt you bring me so much comfort and keep doing what your doing… i’m 14 and you help me with my anxiety myself
you should talk about your experience with ransom and how it felt from being an old fan to actually modeling for them and meeting them <3
this just solidified that im a Matt girl
who would’ve thought u would be the first to post on ur personal channel
I’m so glad Matt feels brave enough to open up about anxiety. As someone who has struggled with severe anxiety since i was pretty much 5 years old, I like to hear about other people’s experience with anxiety. Love you Matt, and you, Chris, and Nick helped me through so much
I love Matt's editing style, love the popups and almost like "conversations" with himself.
i would LOVE a video about mental health if you’d be comfortable doing that. just hearing you talk about it a bit in other videos has made me feel so much better about myself and so comforted!💞💞
THIS IS SO EXCITING
i love how intimate this video is, i’m so glad matt is comfortable with us talking abt anxiety. as someone with anxiety as well, i really appreciate it. this video feels like a big hug, we love u matt<3
loved the editing good job 🫡
17:44 this just made my week LMFAOOOO
every time the pink screen and txt popped up i pissed myself holy shit matt 😂😂😂😂
Omg I’m so happy I’ve been dying for a video from Matt🤍
i appreciate the fact that you take fan requests / video ideas so seriously because you care about what we want and want to give us content we'll enjoy but you have to remember that we're here for YOU! we love you as a whole, we love your humor, your personality and your ideas! we're here for matthew sturniolo and we'll enjoy anything you enjoy filming so just make a list of things you enjoy and film them or talk about them with us and you'll be set! also, the fact that you think you dont have your "it thing" yet could be great content! try a bunch of new hobbies and different stuff alone and film it ! i feel like it would be fun and make u grow and discover things about yourself
Love this 💗
maybe do some like grwm’s :) im super excited to see you all branch out and do your own things <3
✨VIDEO IDEAS✨:  - playlist of the month - day in the life  - going out to somewhere you have never been without your siblings (vlog) .. and trying things on your own (for me it would be going to the movies alone haha i have always wanted to but idk i have siblings too)  - favorites of the month (movie, series, songs, book maybe ? Haha)  - clothing haul (i think people would like that.. i would love a book haul but i think that is asking for too much lol no offense i just have never seen you mention books)  - reaction videos.. - baking series  - just videos talking about how you have been (4 minutes to 1 hour length.. I WOULD LOVE 1 hour length but you do you 😳😌
Ironic that Matt is the first out of all the triplets to have the first video out
I’m so happy for you Matt, I really enjoyed this video. You have a massive impact in peoples lives, I love u so much and I hope u keep uploading videos if that’s what makes u happy  Love u so so much
Matt I’m genuinely so proud of you for driving alone even though it’s a challenge for you. I’ll look forward to the videos where you’ll be talking about mental health and anxiety. I have anxiety too, and hearing other people talk about what might have helped them get through tough times, and like what they experience with their anxiety in general is always nice. But ofc, you should only talk ab it to the point where you’re comfortable with it. Anyways, love the editing 10/10
Matt this was fr such a good video, the editing was so good and matched ur vibe perfectly and it was cool getting to hear more about you 🫶 can’t wait for more on this channel
Matt, you are the furthest thing from boring. I enjoyed watching this and hearing everything you spoke on. So proud, keep being you!
i dont know who you are. but hi!
I was so excited for this video! Matt I hope you know how much we love you and that being " boring" is totally okay and normal. You are a normal human being we don't expect for you to be always funny or doing some crazy shit, you are perfect the way you are!!!! Also I really hope you talk about your anxiety because I also struggle with it and it makes me fell more normal knowing I'm not the only one dealing with anxiety! So yeah I love you a lot💞💞💞💞
i love you so much matt❤️
Matt u are literally perfect.
matt, you know that you have to make a pogo stick video on your personal channel
love you
loved it matt!!
you are the most pure and sweet person ily <3
absolutely love this video and getting to hear you talk. you should definitely make more videos and touch on your anxiety ik it will help me hearing how someone copes with the same thing i have. and you are not a boring person i found this very entertaining. 💞
Don't stress about how entertaining a video idea is. Do something that makes you happy. We'll all be keen to watch, because we love seeing you happy. Sending you my love ❤
When you said 5 foot realm 😭 u mean five foot radius
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN AFTER YOU TALKED ABOUT THE CELLO HAHAHA
Please talk about your anxiety it will help me.
I love this
matt, i feel like you consider yourself as the boring one or it being boring if your the only one there. and if i’m being truly honest, you are the most un-boring person i have watched on youtube in a while. i myself have had struggles with anxiety and i can fully admit that you’ve helped me realise that it’s not just me. you’re such a funny person and you really make me laugh in times where it’s not even funny. i really love the way you can openly talk about your anxiety and you are comfortable about sharing the struggles of it. and i very much appreciate you and your brothers making videos twice a week, for all of us to watch. something that i’m really happy about is that this weeks wednesday video, is the date of my birthday! so i’m really looking forward to be able to watch my faves on my birthday! love you guys a lot ❤️❤️
ur editing is hilarious keep it up lol
Matt.. hear me out.. your intro should be you kissing the camera.. because we ALL miss that 😭❤️
Hey Matt!
THIS VIDEO WAS A 10/10.. I enjoyed the Q and A and Matts editing  * chefs kiss"
THE MUSICAL TOPIC KILLED ME HAHAHAHA
HOLY FUCK MATT THIS IS GONNA BE AWESOME
could honestly watch matt read his shopping list and wouldn't be bored <3
this is the cutest thing, I love this for you :) btw you make sense so don’t worry lol
that made me want a pickle
you did an amazing job at editing this video. 👏👏👏
Pls pls pls do a video talking about anxiety and how you cope with it. I’ve been struggling a lot lately with anxiety especially in like social settings and I NEED ways to cope with it! I love how open you are about your anxiety that also brings me a lot of comfort; knowing that someone else is going through the same thing as me. Thank you so so much. I don’t think you will ever be able to understand how grateful I am that I found you bc I don’t think I can quite understand it fully yet😂 thank you for making my life more bearable. Thank you for constantly being yourself. Also I’m very sorry if this is a lot to ask but could you maybe when you have time make your cameo available again. I know it’s a lot to ask bc you have so many new followers now but I really need a Matt pep talk right about now😅 love you so so much, please never forget how amazing you are! I’m very awkward and don’t know how to end this so uh love you bye🫣🥰
I LOVE YOUUUUUUUU
I absolutely loved this video :)) make more QNA’s plssss <3
Definitely want clothing hauls❤
ahhh i’m so happy you made this video
Yesss the matt outros are back :)
I just finished watching the whole video, I love Matt so much for opening up about his anxiety and how he’s been doing. Him calling himself boring broke my heart because he doesn’t realize that his videos are going to be entertaining in the future and people can learn more about anxiety in general. WE LOVE YOU MATT ❤️❤️❤️🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼
Bro same w the pee anxiety. No where to go and I start panicking lmao
matt i loved this video so much! you’re not boring at all and you’re videos are so entertaining. i love how you’re so open to ideas and im really grateful for you!!
crying bc matt got to talk for 18 mins straight 🥲
MATT you’re literally me. I have bad anxiety and used to play the cello lmao
Love you matt
i already know ima love this channel
Matt I promise you've done absolutely amazing w this channel and video so far. We would watch any vid trust me, even if u think it's "boring"
AWW MATTTTTT
I LOVE THIS VIDEO SO MUCH
the editing is so cute
I like you talking about random shit 😂😄
just so you know matt, i relate to you SO MUCH like everything you’ve said in this video made so much sense to me from being a "boring" person and being bland to the anxiety. i feel like you have literally the same personality as me. it’s nice to know that there’s someone out there that i can relate too :) ur first video was great!!! you did that so much better than i could do in a million years.
this is the best thing every.
I’m so excited for anxiety content.  I have awful anxiety and panic attacks and I feel like no one is there for me and I can’t relate to anyone. I’m so excited to see that because I go through rough periods a lot, and just got out of a 3 month long anxiety, sad period and I had no one. I’m not at driving age yet but when I do I know I’m going to have the worst driving anxiety not only because of myself but also others. Love you so much and I’m so proud of you for opening up and being that representation for people all over 💜
A lot of blowing going on Matt😦
15:43 me trying to convince myself that my life is not falling apart
THE SCREAM.
this video is such a MATT video i fucking love it! keep making videos bro! you so funny bro like omgg!!!
you should go through ur dms for a video!
i’d love to see matt do some fashion related content like his tik toks, like yes give us hauls, give us fit checks, speak YOUR WORDS
I LOVE YOUR EDITING AND YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN MY FACE WHEN YOU SAID YOU WERE GOOD A CELLO. YOUR EDITING MAKES ME LAUGH AND I CANT WAIT FOR MORE ❤
The BYE- in the  end had me rolling 🤣 🤣
Everyone is talking about like Matt talking about his anxiety and stuff, but I just have to get it out there, the fucking elevator music CRACKS me up a bit too much. Really hope he continues with it lmao
I LOVE THE EDITING LMAO GOOD JOB MATT
14:26 yesss like when someone brings up a topic and then we start going down memory lane>>
I love this video so much. Matt brings me so much comfort. Like the three of them do, but Matt makes me feel so much better about anxiety and things like that. I have never related to someone so much as I did to Matt in this video. I know he might think that he's boring and that the video is too but it really isn't. I would watch his videos even if they were hours long. I love getting to see more of Matt, as usually Nick and Chris interrupt him or just talk more than him. It was so nice to have him just talking and being himself. It literally made me so happy. Like I was smiling so much from the beginning just because I was so happy to watch this video. I'm so glad that we get to see more of him alone. I literally love him so much <3
the way the shadow falls on his shirts makes it look like he has a mullet which is throwing me tf off
I totally understood the memory thing omfg .
literally one of the people who motivates me to move further, and to do better. love u matt, congrats on your first vid ❤️
I feel like he has my personality fr, super exited about this channel Matt
cant answer any of your questions because im embarrassingly close to tearing up you did so great
Matt your literally the sweetest person ever oml ! but you slayed this video LMAOAOA. And I can’t want till the next video <3!
so i’ve come to the conclusion that matt isn’t good at either blowing or fingering😃😃😃😃😃
the little comments in the middle of your sentences actually made me laugh so hard. i honestly love these kinds of videos, your doing great :)
i love this so much
I love how real and relatable Matt is
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE!! TURN IT UP!!
Matt you should film gaming videos!!
15:42 MATT AND I LET OUT THE SAME LAUGH AT THE SAME TIME LMAOOO
Matt can you please bring back the camera kisses at the end, even if it’s just on here?
you get ‘em when you get ‘em, so don’t get upset-‘em
Love you Matt💕
I enjoyed this a lot I'll be looking forward to the rest
i really think if you wanna talk about your anxiety you should start for where you first started getting it and how you dealt with it because I know there’s a lot of people out there including myself that got anxiety when I was really young, I was in the sixth grade so it would be cool to see someone that can relate to that!
Ayo what f uck was walking past just after 2 mins in the back???? Looked like someone in a mask
4:54 i actually understood that exactly. i love my sisters and one of them i used to be really close with until she stopped coming, i havent seen her in 6 years and i cry about it a lot. especially since, like matt said, i have attachment issues. so it was literally like having a sister then not
This is such a big deal Matt! Proud of you & I hope that you’re proud of yourself because this takes work being vulnerable isn’t easy keep glowin king!
we love you so so so much matt <33
U did great Matt<3 love u so much
W video and I can not wait to see more. I would love to see some anxiety talks  but it is totally up to you on what you post, I will love any videos that you post! Ily:) have a good rest of you night!
"DAMN I WAS BLOWING ALOT OF THINGS " I'M DEADD
I'm excited for this channel, anxiety talks will really help me and makes me feel less alone about it; seeing someone that I look up to and someone who inspires me to do YouTube and social media talk about something that's affected me for awhile now and relating to them helps a lot especially when its anxiety that's stopping me from chasing my dreams atm. I cant wait for the next video even if its in months times, we love u matt! (also if u were worried u sounded stupid or awkward being alone talking I didn't think u did so no need to worry) <3
i already know i am going to love these videos. the chats, the hauls, just chilling, love it. i literally had the biggest smile the entire time.
HI MATT
i’m so proud of him for being able to do this alone
"i''m gonna do a lot of anxiety talk on here, 'cause i get bad anxiety, and i don't think it's something touched upon enough throughout the creator community" MATTTTT:(((((( I LOE YOU SO MUCH u dont even know how much that means to me dude
YES. PLEASE DO VIDEOGAMES. VV ENTERTAINING.
never change matty b <3
i feel like Matt has this expectation that his videos will be boring, but just to have him talk, without being interrupted (no hate to Nick or Chris), is so soothing and relaxing. i would genuinely watch your videos anytime of day and be calm.
your voice is so comforting i really love listening to you talk
Do move videos for sure<3
i could literally listen to him for hours
honestly the biggest creds to you matt. it must feel weird to do this all by yourself for the first time, but I just wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed it. bringing up these topics that are not as usual to talk about creates a safe space and helps with understanding you and others with similar experiences. also the editing was amazing I don't understand why you ever mistrusted your skills lmao
i really got my hopes up at the end thinking matt was gonna bring back his outro kisses
i love you doing a personal channel and watching you as a person please do more of these!!
He is so precious and comforting
I love this side of you 💀 you’re literally so funny and so different without your brothers in a good way
hearing matt talking about his anxiety makes me feel more comfortable about my own / every time matt says he’s boring makes me so sad because he’s not 💜
just want to say thank you because honestly, you make me and a lot of other people feel so safe so just thank you.
This is just so comforting🖤 thank youuuu
I was a wizard at the chello 😂 mixing up harry potter in there 😂
15:05 HE SAID INDERNED😭😭😭😭
Anxiety sucks man, it ruined a lot for me but your such a huge inspiration and help so many people cope with it and forget about it for just a few minutes, thank you, love you matt
keep up the great work matt!!!
I have anxiety and it has been hard this past year and hearing that matt will talk about his anxiety makes me feel so much better. I am also so happy that they made these separate channels because now they are able to say what they want without getting cut off or not having enough time. I cant wait to watch your own channel and get to know you guys separately.
❤️
Matt u have the kindest soul:)
was not awkward at all. legit so entertaining love him on his own. so proud
you did so good!!! so proud of you💖💖
LMAOO BLOWING?!? 😭
Matt i Love you, but this video spounded so depressing. Btw. I stopted watching tangled to watch your video 🖤🖤
whatever you do with your platform, people (including me) will listen. we value your voice and you talking about sensitive and relatable topics such as anxiety really serves as a role model for a lot of people. we’re very proud of you♥️♥️
matt, i know you think you don't have much to offer, but you bring so much comfort to so many people by just talking about the way you think. you might not understand how lmao bUT you do.. we 🫶🏼 you for who you are, if there's not a lot of things that you can talk about or do, you can literally lounge around and we'll still enjoy it because it's you :) thank you for always being so honest & open about who you truly are, i appreciate that so much.
<3
loved this videoooo
I would love to see Matt do a series where he attempts to do things on his own. Like going to buy groceries or ordering at the drive through! I get his anxiety might make those more difficult but would be really satisfying to watch him overcome that and realise how capable he is. It would also show people dealing with similar issues that they can do it too.   Maybe could format it as a bucket list type of thing that he could tick off every time he does something he's never done on his own before? Just an idea, but I'll watch whatever he puts out regardless :)
yesssirrr great video ‼️your upcoming video ideas were good. any content frm you is good content… yk unless it’s not.. but it will be 😎
I would love to see a video of him cooking alone and telling storytimes or smth
I hope you know we don’t find you boring and I just find ur voice so relaxing and you talking about anxiety so openly makes me feel like I’m not alone 🤍🤍
I would love if you start taking about your anxiety I love how you explain it and use the right words to explain it and it makes me feel like I’m not alone when you talk about anxiety but anyways I loved this video see you once a month maybe ? 🤨
i love how u edited this HAJAH it’s really you 😭🫶🏼
I really liked your video, it was comforting and it felt like talking to a friend. In your next videos you can talk about what you love, your favourite things, storytimes that you want to share, opinions on everything, unpopular opinions. If you have something you like to do you can bring it in this channel, such as a talent, a passion, learning or playing a instrument. I hope you'll update sometimes, just a quick checkpoint on life. Happy to be here today, can't wait for the next video. Love you really really much. Be safe and thank you for being yourself. <3<3<3
Honestly its so cool watching u alone this shittt made me happy
I felt the anxiety of the small things. It’s kind of like you hold your breath and as soon as you get ready to let it all out you start thinking about some other stuff and it just become a spiral and you just can’t stop yourself
you talking about your feelings is so helpful and relatable. you’re doing great matt, especially considering this is your first video alone
Kinda early
the way you locked the car doors when the person walked behind the car is the most matt sturniolo thing i’ve ever seen lamp. ur so sweet, ty for being so vulnerable <3
the editing is adorable i love it sm it’s so funny
You have really help me understand my own experience with anxiety and I am so grateful to you for that. I really loved this video and I absolutely love the editing part. Just know that whatever you choose yo do there’s gonna be ai many of us supporting you. Love uuuu, have a great week <3
You absolutely make my day. Being comfortable talking about your anxiety helps so many people including me. You are such a comfort person for me and to so many people. I can’t wait to see more of your videos!
I found y’all on tiktok recently and instantly felt like y’all were amazing people. As a person who suffers from anxiety on a daily basis, I would love for that to be a topic that is discussed. Thank you for taking the time to make this video, you truly are a great person:)
1. this brought me a lot of joy 2. my sister drinks pickle juice all the time 3. i love you and never give up
Okay matt 😎
MATT BRING BACK THE CAM KISSES FOR OUTROS!!!
I’m so proud of you Matt❤️You’re doing a great job and just keep being yourself and don’t stress to much, thanks for talking more about anxiety and your experience it really helps❣️Love everything you do bye!😽❤️😇❣️😌
I could listen to Matt talk for hours and not get bored
I think this is the longest Matt has ever spoke without being interrupted 😂, Loved the video ❤️
HI

HII im so excited that you all are starting your individual channels itll give your fans a chance to connect with you guys individually !! love you💌
MATT WE LOVE YOU SO SO MUCH
matt this video was literally so good. I seriously wish you could see yourself the way those who love you do! it is so refreshing to see genuine, real content. love you so much <3 so proud of how far youve come, and i cant wait to see whats in store for you next
17:17 The way he said "Subscribe baby , that would be cool " made my heart melt . He is so adorable 😣
keep doing the sit down vids they r cool gaming vids would slap too
literally not even a minute into this and I already vibe with it. The editing: approved🤝
ok the editing is way too funny I love it !!!
Don’t call yourself boring! I feel like everyone thinks they’re boring but that’s just our insecurities
i loved this, you did awesome. you’ve got sm good coming for you and this is jus the beginning. i’m so excited to watch it happen<3
“If you didn’t,maybe you’ll enjoy the next” i’m dead 😂😂😂
it so weird seeing you alone with no one in the car but so nice in a way
yes the classic matt outro
this made my day so much!!!! Cant wait for the future vids!!!!! Ahhhhh
it was really cool listening to you talk by yourself, def gonna watch your next video!<3
i love how open he is about his life and his mental health :)
I love nick and chris so much and i love their joined YouTube channel but after watching this video I KNOW FOR A FACT that Matt's channel is going to be my new comfort place. i dont know how to describe it but he is my safe place like i feel safe watching him even though he doesn't know me i relate to him so much which is something i never had growing up watching YouTube. Omg i love him so much ♥️
13:22 LMFAOOOOOOOO
this is going to sound daft because you’re identical but you look so much like nick in this video
i’m so proud of u matt !!!! i’d love oulfit hauls and coping with anxiety but please take ur time and however long u need to get used to the personal channel stuff n stuff
Absolutely loved Matt talking I could listen to him for hours.
MATT UR EDITING IS HILARIOUS I LOVE IT
I love editing you commentaries throughout the video when it say ‘I was blowing everything’ that killed me 😂
bro i love u
WE GOT A SCREAM AT THE END😮😮😮
U DID SO GOOD LOVE IT
feeling the strong urge to buy him flowers as we speak
his editing is everything
Matt, this video was really cool. I feel like it’s the first time that we actually get to “hang out” with you and let me tell you, you’re so enjoyable 🖤
do driving with matt videos!!! i wonder if that would help with anxiety like taking to the camera when you’re driving , we won’t psychically be there but you can just talk to the camera like we are 😂💘
Omg i used to play the cello it was always bigger than me but i wasn’t bad at it tbh
Matt we low key need a camera kiss for an outro
i really like how open you are one here abt mental issues and how you cope with everything. i’m really proud of you for doing this and stepping out of ur comfort zone. i hope you continue to grow and learn more abt ur self just like u want. thank you for going out of ur way and filming a vid without your brothers and i hope sometime in the future you get to post more often. all love<3
this is so calming because its just matts voice and no yelling or interrupting or anything (as funny as it is) it's so nice to have my favorite triplet isolated into his own video :)) so proud of u matt. thank u for being so open about ur mental health and thank you for this masterpiece of a video including the editing lol this is the perfect level of calming and chaotic and im here for it
Go at your own pace to do your videos but can't wait to see them! As a person who suffer of anxiety it makes me feel safe to watch you talk about it or just talk like that in videos, thanks for your work hope you stay happy and healthy! Congrats for your solo channel and Hi from France ✌️🥰
My favourite part about this is that u said chris and nick said they were going to start personals then u post before either of them. 😂 also i loved hearing u laugh at yourself near the end and loosen up and feel comfortable talking by yourself by the end of the video.
i really appreciate that some of your videos are gonna b touching on anxiety, i have to deal with anxiety daily and even wake up w/ it usually just being there so it’s really nice to b able to relate w/ someone i look up to !
I feel so comfortable while I'm listening to u and the way u speak about anxiety it feels great so plz make a video about it, it will be restful.
This is honesty so cool seeing just you speak because you are always interrupted in triplets vids and it’s really interesting to see you open up and I’m really exited for this channel
do some sunset drives and listen to music, or go sit outside and write or read or something. I know I’m not a triplet but I have 4 other sibling around the same age and so many cousins the same age and we were alwayssss together. I had and still do have anxiety about being by myself but being close and near people you feel safe with but still having that space to yourself helps so much
Why is matt so mean to himself when his editing 😭
i love the future editor-matt notes
On the off days that we do get your videos just with that I’d be happy & excited with anything 😭
Love it!! <3
im really excited to hear about the anxiety talk, as someone who struggles badly with anxiety disorders im happy to see someone who i look up to you speak on something so important
I am so so proud of you❤️‍🔥Can’t wait to know you better. You are amazing. Love you so much.🥺
YOU ARE SO FUNNY!! ILY <3
It's so cool to get to hearing Matt and how he really is or how he feels, there's so many things I can relate to that I didn't know and it's like we'll know a part of him that he doesn't shows that often on their triplets channel. So I'm very proud of u and I hope this will be a great experience to u<3
Please post more than once a month!!! this was rlly entertaining already and I think ur videos are gonna be so good!!
bro this video is so good!!! I'm so proud of Matt!!
13:21 this editing is too funny
Not going to lie, I kinda cried watching this because you bring me soo much comfort! I'm so happy that you're going to post personal videos once in awhile, it was SOO refreshing getting to hear you talk without being interrupted!! I absolutely love these kinds of videos and absolutely wouldn't mind seeing more like this, and I'm especially looking forward to when you talk about anxiety. Please do whatever you're comfortable with doing and don't feel pressured to post the most amazing videos; we appreciate you for you, and no matter what you put out we will love it🤍 I love you soo much and I hope you enjoy this new journey 🤍 I'm so proud of you 🤍
I love this video format! I’m super excited for more Matt talks <3
i love you so much
matt is so comforting, he makes me feel so safe
he is literally so calming to listen to
Really looking forward to these anxiety talks🫶
I love you Matt💗🥹
,,how the fuck am  i supposed to make this bitch focus,, hit me AJJAJAJAJHAHAH
Matt editing realizing that he kept saying he was blowing shit WAS SO FUNNY FOR NO REASON
“pickles never did anything to me” has me CACKLING
I have no clue who you or your brothers are just randomly got recommended this video so congrats for that
Most I’ve heard you talk and it was awesome, good job Matt
get it matty b! proud of you for uploading your first video !!
Matt, this video is awesome! We understand everything you want to explain perfectly, you are a person who is worth a lot and you have to believe it!!! A big hug from Barcelona :) Pd: the editing was great I swear hahaha
never heard Matt talk so much at once haha i loved it
i love this solo channel already! I have anxiety too so it's really nice to have someone to relate to : )
matt makes me so happy. i’m so excited to see more videos! love you matt 💕
I’m so proud of you! You did amazing. You’re anxiety talks are gonna help so many people (me being one) it’s gonna help me be able to talk about it myself and be more comfortable about talking about it. You did amazing Matt🦋💚
Love this chill vibe ngl dont stop this shit I fw it
We would all love your content to be about anxiety
do a video on ur channel or the group channel if you guys sharing your most embarrassing stories LMAOOO
MATTHEW, THIS IS SO GOOD!! YOUR EDITING IS SICK AND ITS NICE TO SEE YOU NOT GETTING INTERRUPTED😭
MATT YOU ARE AN AMAZING PERSON DON’T FORGET THAT. I HOPE YOU ARE AWARE OF HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU HELP OUT THERE BY JUST TALKING ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH ANXIETY. WE ALL LOVE U SO MUCH AND WE ARE ALL HERE FOR YOU <333
this video was a great change of pace, and it was great to hear you get to talk about anything you wanted. i think it would be really entertaining if you did some videos where you played games or went through some of your favorite albums. I’m excited for where this channel is headed :)
I think that pranks would be so entertaining and so funny and the posting once a month would help your brothers not know when the pranks are coming yk? Idk if that made sense 😭
GOOD JOB ON THE EDITING MATT!!!
the little notes throughout the vid were so funny
I actually loved this video, it felt kinda weird to hear Matt talk so much, but I really enjoyed it, it was very comforting. Keep up the good work Matty B!
i could listen to you talk forever
I like these kinda convo videos like even if they don’t have a topic
Clothing hauls - love the idea Anxiety talks- love the idea Jewelry tour - love the idea  Day in the life- no because you nick and chris almost have the same life😭
W vid
I love this so much Matt. Getting to hear you actually speak without being interrupted is really nice. AND THE EDITING MADE ME LAUGH SO HARD. I'm super excited to get to know you better through this channel and I'm so happy you decided to make it. ❤️
I really hope you realize that you are such an amazing, exciting, kind, perfect person without nick and Chris and so many people are here for you whenever. You mean so much to me and millions of other people. I'm so happy you made your own personal channel and I'm so excited to watch your videos ❤️❤️
I love you
pls make more😭😭💗💗
im so glad to hear that Matt is not ashamed or embarrassed to talk about his anxiety it makes me so happy and proud. Im so excited for the future of him and his channel <3 love you Matt
i love hearing matt talk!! he never gets to talk in car videos so this is perfect for him ❤
I felt this video i really loved it
Matt, you actually don’t realize how great you are…i feel so bad when you say you’re boring and not because i’m sorry for you but because that is completely not true. You are a wonderful and very interesting person, and i hope some day you will look at yourself the way we all do. Continue posting on this channel, you’re doing great <3
Hey Matt, first of all congratulations on your first solo video! 🎉 Please don’t feel pressured to be entertaining, you’re not boring. This video kinda gives a talk-between-friends vibes and it’s really really great to hear your thoughts on whatever subject you might choose in the future. I’m sure the more videos you’re gonna film, the more you’ll feel at ease. Also good job on the editing 👌.   PS: English is not my first language (I’m Italian) but I love watching your videos with Nick and Chris because they’re a great listening practice ahah 😅. Lots of love ❤
“DAMN I WAS BLOWING EVERYTHING”   MATT PLEASE💀💀
IM SO PROUD OF YOU WTF
i never realized how much matt and i are pretty much alike. we both never really wear rings, and when we do we usually only wear them for pictures then take em' off for the rest of the day, we both played trumpet which was extremely surprising, and that when were alone none of the shit we say ever makes sense.   now to the point, hearing matt talk about his anxiety really makes me feel ok to the point where i know i can speak up about it myself and not have to worry about what other people are going to say. i really do thank matt for that because he has been the one that has been helping me build up my confidence and not letting peer pressure take me into do so much shit that can get me in a lot of trouble. so thank you Matt, for all the stuff you've gotten me through <33
did anyone else see when he saw someone in the background and locked the doors 🥺
just listening to u talk matt is so entertaining and calming. plz plz keep making this videos cause as one who also struggles with anxiety u help me so much and i love u
matt I'm gonna be honest and I know this isn't helpful idea-wise but you could post about anything and I'm gonna watch it, just do whatever you feel comfortable with <3
I THINK U SHOULD DO A RANSOM COLLECTION VIDEO I WOULD WATCH IT
the scream or the kiss for the outro will do it for me. ✅
WE NEED A KISS AT THE END.
THE WAY I FLEW TO THIS VIDEO—
i love and appreciate u so much and i really enjoyed this video please keep going w these kind of bids id love to listen to u just talk about whats on yr mind again i love you lots and please bring back the outro kisses because i miss them so much. thank u for existing you’re the best fucking thing that has ever happened to me im so happy i found u.
The outrooooo❤️😭😭
i love this video
this made me so happy
matt watching you personally, i think, makes a lot of us realize we have a lot more in common and you really help a lot of us realize we have you to look up to, even if you think you're not a good idol, we love you so much. and you seriously have helped us so much.
i love the little annotations HSKSHAK
Matt locking the door when a man walks past the door😭😭
This is THE most heartwarming video I have ever seen. It really felt like I was having a conversation with a friend and you really made me feel comfortable with my anxiety. It's beautiful to see people be so unforgivably themselves.
obsessed with this. it feels like we are on facetime and we are just catching up. also, thank you so much for talking about ur mental health. so many people, including myself, struggle with it on a daily basis & u starting the conversation is so amazing. love you so much matt ❤️❤️❤️
me : a person who drink pickle juice  Matt : “I cant with people who drink pick juice from the jar”  😬😬😬 this is awkward
Matt explaining what we feel is legit the best knowing that someone can represent us and explain what we feel and how much it affects our lives.❤️
MATT PLS BRING BACK THE KISS AS THE OUTRO!!!
I LOVE UUUU
I loved this video so much. I was so off today and this really made my day. I would really like an anxiety talk. Thank you!

I am very excited for Matt’s own channel because he doesn’t talk a lot in the videos with nick and chris and I feel like now he can express his feelings and hearing him talking about anxiety makes me feel so much better
Can't wait to see what you do with this channel and getting to watch how fast it'll grow !! love u lots <33

matt do not worry everything u do is entertaining to us so don’t worry if it’s not entertaining to u just hearing u talk is enough to make my day
i was low key expecting him to kiss the camera at the end like i was on the edge of my seat at that outro BAHAHHAHAHA
I love this!! I think that you are very funny and loved listening to you when you talked about your anxiety and helping me a lot. So proud of you❤️ so excited to see more of you.
i love your little notes with the music. it adds pizazz
this is actually so good and comforting, love you Matt!! this is the start of something good for sureeee
The video I never knew I needed 💓
Bro I love the intro and outro it was so good. Also I love the triplets vids of them being loud and energetic but this soft and sweet video just is so comforting.
8:03 STOP I LAUGHED AND CRIED THAT SOUNDS SO SAD
(I didn’t mean to dislike the video) anyways, yeah I think the anxiety talks I will really look forward along with Q&A’s is also something I’m looking forward to.
matt i just wanna say that you did an amazing job for your first video without nick and chris. i know you said it felt weird not having them there to talk to but you’re also very entertaining on your own! :) anyways i hope you have a great day & can’t wait to see your future content on this channel!! <3
i’m so excited to hear more about your anxiety bc i have it too and i would love to hear stories and experiences and how you deal with it bc it’s hard dealing with it for me on a daily basis so if i you can like give tips or something that would be great
I’m living for this editing style, it’s actually so funny and cute! So excited for future videos!!
i love hearing matt talk about his anxiety. his voice is so comforting. also i would love to see days in the life for sure.
i really think you don’t realise how interesting you are and you’re not boring at all. this video was actually very entertaining
i can tell already your anxiety talks will help me majorly<3 so slay!!!!
It was weird hearing Matt speak without getting interrupted 😂love this video btw ❤❤❤
love this casual chatting videos!! definetely keep these going dawg!!!
the way you keep defending yourself the whole time reminds me of myself a lot haha, I do it all the time too. But there's no reason to worry about anything, I think most of the ppl here (including me) would listen to you talking about anything for basically hours. also no need to worry about sounding "pitiful" or something like that, I think we all find it cool hearing someone talk abt their feelings so honestly.  I really liked this, excited to see what's coming up!! (Also your editing is absolutely great lmao)
te amoo
<3
i enjoyed this video sm matt!! i know u don’t think you’re entertaining but you really are and i’m so excited to learn more about you through this because your personality is awesome <33
the outro im dead
omg yes clothing hauls/ grwm would be cool too and anxiety talks!!
Ngl but I enjoyed this video. So thank you for being you !!!
I feel like I might have sentimental attachment to his channel bc I relate to this video so much 🥲
“i was a wizard at the cello” LOL😭
MATT I REALLY ENJOYED THIS AND I HOPE U DID TOO,NO JOKE BCS I FELT LIKE IM HAVING A CONVERSION UK??  KEEP DOING WHAT U ENJOY UR DOING SO WELL!! And i love you so so much
Aaah seeing Matt's own video makes me feel so safe and comfortable, I feel like this is going to be really good for his personal development aswell <3
ilyy <3
you talking about anxiety makes me feel so valid and comforted. i’m looking forward to seeing you talk about it more. we’re all so proud of you matt <3
im so incredibly proud of you matt! can't wait to see more<3
This made me cry this is so sweet
no cause i have such bad attachment issues from my sister too
AH MATT it was so good tyy
I love that you talk about anxiety. It’s so comforting, helpful and just relatable. It’s also important to talk about it. You have helped so many people with anxiety including myself. We love you <3
you are so fcking cool man keep going
I think it would be very cool if you talked more about your anxiety  because it's such a misunderstood topic, I would also be interested in how you deal with it and what you do when you don't know what to do, you know what i mean and very helpful for me and another people. Love you💗🫶🏼
I just love the fact how excited he got remembering he played a cello 🥺✋🏻
SLAY MATT
„how on god‘s green earth you would’ve done that…“ PLS
would you talk about driving anxiety as well?
I'm so proud of you, I don't even have words to say how good you make me feel and how much this video made me feel at home, I loved the video ideas, keep being so kind, you deserve everything
This was a great video Matt!! You did amazing, loved the one on one and can’t wait for future videos!!
I literally loved every single second of this. I was laughing so hard at your edits. Getting to actually hear Matt talk without getting interrupted was great. Can't wait for more Matt content lol. Also, just wanted to say speaking on behalf of a lot of us. No pressure in uploading on a schedule. Y'all are already working incredibly hard to get content out on the Sturniolo Triplets channel and we love that content. I am so beyond proud of how far y'all have come already and can't wait to see what else the future holds and can't wait to get to know y'all even better. I love you unconditionally. ❤❤
PLEASE BRING BACK THE KISSES
First of all Matt you are not boring at all this entire video i was smiling and laughing and im glad you’re gonna talk about your anxiety because i have anxiety as well and hearing you be open about it has really helped me and i feel like i have someone to relate to <3
Bro the end scared me omg 😆
You need to know that we do find you entertaining. Youre not boring at all. Dont worry so much about making videos that well love, because I promise you that we do. I could just sit and watch you talk about random shit for hours. I had to set an alarm to wake up just to see this video, and I get really bad anxiety when I dont get enough sleep. I would do anything for you. And I know im not the only one. You are not boring without your brothers. Its really nice to hear you talk without being interupted the whole time. We love you okay<3 Never forget that. We love you whatever you do.
Such a good first video
New comfort video
Matt you may not realize it but you've literally helped me so much  I love you so fkn much thank you for sharing your experience with anxiety and for literally everything else you always give me hope and make me feel safe and I'm forever thankful for you and you brothers.
Loved the video and hearing you talk without getting interrupted hehe! I'm really looking forward to anxiety related videos, since it's something I struggle with too and I'm very excited to see what else you come up with.
The side eye Matt is giving us after everything that sounded depressing, as if he wanted to see our reaction, is just pure gold
Hearing you talk about your anxiety makes me feel less alone about mine and I know makes others feel less alone. You’re doing amazing things Matt we are all proud of you<4
Ahhh I love this so much. I can’t wait to see what videos come from you matt! ❤️
you talking about anxiety would make me much better about it but it’s only if you’re comfortable with talking about it
as someone who struggles with really bad anxiety every single day i appreciate so much the fact that you're being so open and wanting to talk about it. especially because talking about your personal experience may be hard, but i hope you know that we love you and we would never judge you. you're awesome matty
yes to clothing hauls pls!
Loving this we need more 💥💥💥💥
the way he sees the guy walking behind his car and instantly locks the door is so funny to me cos i do the same exact thing  lmao
Me tryna film a YouTube video lol
When you talked about playing instruments😭😭😭
Matt you seem like a great person with a great personality I’m am so excited for future videos
video game videos would be cool!!! or reaction videos- and talking videos like this!!
Man I love this video! Just every thing about it, you got to believe in yourself a little more, cause dude you’re doing amazing❤️🔥🥰
I feel like Matt needs to give himself more credit, just because he's not as loud as Nick and Chris are, doesn't mean he's boring. I already feel like we got more of a glimpse of his personality in this video and it was really nice to just to be able to hear him talk uninterrupted for once
matt, u are literally one of my favs and i feel so much better with my anxiety because of you. i love you so much 🫶🏻. im so happy that you started and actually making youtube videos by yourself ❤️
its so refreshing to actually be able to hear you talk for more than a minute without getting interrupted.
The ending noise made me laugh so hard
please don’t change anything i love u so much just be yrself bc its the best fucking thing u could ever do
I LOVE LOVE LOVE THE VIDEO!!!!!! CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Anxiety is such a painful topic for me because i was in hospital for it BUT Matt talking about it makes me feel so much better
THE OUTRO 😭😭😭
MY HEARTS MELTING THE ENDING IDEK MAN TEHYRE SO GRATEFUL FOR THEIR FANS LIKE IDEK MORE THAN OTHRS YK BC "SUMTIEMS THEYRE JUS TALKING" YK IDEK?
hearing matt speak up and out of his comfort zone brings a smile to my face 🥹
matt ur so not boring i literally had the time of my life listening to u talk for whole 18mins
Thank you so much for everything you’ve done for me and many others! We’re all so proud of you!
Love you matt so proud of you about everything and everything
This is great, LOVE THIS. So proud of you Matt, LOVE YA, hope to see more of this channel in the future :))
i hope you enjoyed your reeses skittles and peach snapple that you didn’t get to eat it the video
I have a video idea, what if you react to fan fiction or react to anonymous confessions and rank them.
i hope you are felling well!! i was so happy when i hear that you were doing your own youtube channel! i know anxiety can be so hard but everything is going to come in places, it’s going to be fine. i have the biggest level of anxiety ever but you helped me so much trough that! every-time im doing an anxiety attack i’m watching my fav vid of u and everything is getting better. take care💖 i love you so much thank you for everything!!🤍
matt i loved this video, we’re proud of you❤️❤️ i would love hearing you talking about your anxiety, thai would make me fell less weird and alone in mine❤️
I GOT SCARED IN THE END BECAUSE I ACCIDENTALLY PUT MY VOLUME ON MAX SO NOW MY DAD IS YELLING AT ME😭😭😭
listening to just matt talking was literally so calming. idk how to explain it but, matt, you make me feel like it’s all gonna be ok. you’ve helped me realize that it’s ok to struggle and i’m so grateful for the impact you’ve had on my life. i love you forever 🫶🏻
I'm so proud of him
I think the anxiety talks are such a good way to prove to others that there not alone and there’s lots of others people going through the same thing. I also think it will create a safe space for people to talk about there experiences in the comments
i would really like to have anxiety talk videos because as a person with anxiety I feel like i would enjoy those types of videos
GREAT EDITING MATTY B 👏 proud of u
i thought the video would be awkward but it was actually really entertaining and the random comments were so funny... i relate to the parts about anxiety so it was good to hear u talk about it... great first video, excited for more in the future:)
Hi
It felt so werid with it just being you but love the vid
also just to point out ur insta in the desc doesnt work
omg the sidekick answer🥲 MATT
as someone who drinks pickle juice i feel very offended 💔
I feel like I'm the happiest person alive. I just had a really bad panic attack because I have to prepare a role-play by tomorrow, which I have to present to the whole class. But I haven't even started because I get panicked every time I look at the assignment. I don't know if that made sense, but I feel kinda safe here. Anyway, I then saw this long-awaited notification and I already felt much better. So I just wanted to let you know that I (and probably a whole lot of other people too) am so grateful that you let us participate in your life. 🤍
Him saying he’s boring kind of breaks my heart bc he isn’t! I really kind of feel like him in the way of attachment issues with my family especially leaving and having anxiety! I hope you’re okay Matt & I can’t wait to see you rise up 😭🤚🏽
i think you talking about your anxiety would be great and would help so many people including myself! 💕💕
the edits were so funny ong 😭😭
I’m so proud of you!!! You’re amazing!! Literally love you❤️ love how you’re willing to be so open about your anxiety!! As someone with anxiety I’m so proud of you❤️ But the “damn I was just blowing everything”😭😭
you making fun of yourself while editing is the funniest thing
MATTY B!!! loved this first vid, excited to see where ur channel goes 🥰 & good on u for doing ur own thing even after being a lil worried abt it!!! v v excited for uuuuu
matt this video was so good!! i loved it
I love this
i likkkkeee thissss love you matt keep posting what ever you like <3
absolutely love this
i honestly didnt know that matt can talk this confident . The editing i just find it funny lmao . But anyways i lowkeyy loved it
Thank you so much for your talking on anxiety! I've had anxiety for four-five years, and just the way you talk about is so soothing and therapeutic for some reason, anyways  I'm sorry if that comes off weird, but thank you again and love you, Matt ♥
I’m so proud of u!!!! I’m really looking forward to your anxiety videos because im dealing with the same shit
You are going to become my comfort YouTuber 😭🥹
DON‘T CHANGE SHIT MAN I ENJOYED THIS SM
love it
The end was so wholesome
Loved every idea especially talking about your anxiety, you have helps so many people and don’t even know it, me included I have struggled with anxiety for years and lately I haven’t been so bad, I wanna thank you for that. Not going to say everything bc I could go on and on about it but I love you so much 💜and so proud of you 💗
The fact that u got off track means u DO have a lot to say! And we love to hear it Matty b <3 the editing is fun and i can’t wait to hear about your experience with anxiety bc I can relate !!
i’m really looking forward to more of these<33
Dude I love your personality and humor frr hahahh

PLS DO A SKIN CARE ROUTINE UR SKIN IS GLOWING
i love that i can relate to matt, especially about the anxiety and being boring, this video is so good
love u matt
I can't even express how happy this made me.  You have impacted my life so much.  And as someone who struggles with anxiety every day, I can't wait to hear your talks about it.  I don't have many people in my life that I can talk to about it but hearing you be so open about it makes me feel like I'm not alone.  Thank you so much
MATT U ARE THE BEST!!!
Hey Matt! this was a great video and NOT boring!! Keep being you! <333
matt you’re the king of the outros
matt i want you to know that i loved this. you are not boring at all i was entertained the whole time, and hearing you talk abt your anxiety really made me happy bc i’m a person that struggles with it really bad and hearing one of my favorite people talk abt makes me feel better abt having it so thank you<3
Hi matt, i wanted to say that even if you think your account is gonna be boring, i’m all here for it because i love how real you are. Being fun all the time is honestly unrealistic and i love how honest you are about yourself and your standards. Calm videos like this about yourself are just as perfect as the ones you do with your brothers and i hope you know that however well your account goes compared to theirs, we all watch you coz we love you for you. Thanks for being so real, this is what is so great about you and good luck on your account!! I LOVE YOU MATT 🫶🏻
I loved this video . I could watch 10000 videos of you talking about whatever
“ no need to worry about me , ong “
I LOVED IT MATT U MADE ME LAUGH MULTIPLE TIMES BY YOURSELF TRUST

tbh a talk about anxiety would be great. i have terrible anxiety as well and having someone to relate to is so helpful.
the editing was absolutely hilarious Matthew 10/10 loved it
I can't  wait for the anxiety talk video because I feel like it would help me more with my anxiety

this is such a comforting thing to watch please keep making these i loved it :) also please talk about anxiety if your comfortable it would help myself and so many otherssss
Editing was great like how you kept it simple. Clothing hauls would definitely be interesting as well.
matt slayed the first video on his personal channel
MATTTTTTTTT
Hey Matt! I don’t know if it’s just me, but I like the idea of having pop up videos every now and then, again don’t know if that’s just me 😅😅 Also thanks for letting us know that your gonna be talking about you anxiety, because I know it will help bunches of people and it will definitely help me, 😅❤️ Bye!!!!!
I have anxiety since I was a kid so those talks are going to be helpful
i got so excited thinking he was going to kiss the camera at the end when he grabbed the camera😭😭
I have no other words than I proud of u Matt,and I would love to watch about ur anxiety,cuse I aswell struggle with anxiety and it would make me so happy to see someone talk about this,and thank u Matt four being such a good influence on me,luv u .💗
honestly, just you talking about random stuff that you think is boring is already enough, we love listening to you💞
The outro >
Matt talking about his mental health is honestly so helpful like I’m starting to feel more comfortable with my anxiety and I’m more accepting that if I don’t feel 100% it’s okay like I’m allowed to have off days and without Matt I don’t think I would’ve ever been able to feel like that, so thank you <3
This brought me so much comfort
matt, don't worry about "entertaining" us just be you. we love you and all of us true fans genuinely care about you and what you have to say. I absolutely loved this and I am so excited for future videos. and just to be clear, this video was very entertaining. love you!
I love how you make fun of yourself 😭
this was just really comforting to watch! thank you for this matt<3

Although you think of yourself as boring Matt, this was an amazing video, and I 100% found it entertaining. I’ll be waiting for the next upload, hopefully sooner rather than later.
It makes me so sad that he thinks he’s boring :( also ur editing and little commentary is hilarious
Honestly I’m so excited to see what you post next even if it months away ur so relatable and I’m so glad you so true to people.
kid was a wizard at the cello
I'm actually so proud of matt for videoing and editing this all himself (or I assume) and I'm so excited for more matt content
you’re my comfort person ily 🧡
So proud of you Matt! No matter what other people think, it was so awesome for it to be just you being yourself and talking about what you wanted! Also don't feel pressured whatsoever to be consistent on this channel. I think I'm not just speaking for myself here, but I'd be happy to see any content from you, no matter the schedule.  Good job homie! You killed it!
i love your editing
i’m actually excited if the anxiety talks happen, i feel like it’d help me a lot
the texts are so funny omg
It was honestly so lovely to hear Matt speak for 18 minutes without being interrupted and I love that he is comfortable sharing his struggle with anxiety with us, it definitely makes me feel less alone with my anxiety knowing that Matt really understands what it’s like <3
Matt is a mood ‘ I’m going go to go eat those now ‘ is Me
Matt I absolutely loved this so much. The little scream at the end.
THIS brought me sm comfort ilysm 💞 frfr
Please please please do anxietytalk it helps me sooo much
This is so cute  I love it
I'm a triplet and omfg I get you so much, doing things by myself is so hard and stressfull bc we're always together.. I get so anxious when I have to do things alone
As I person who has been suffering from anxiety recently a lot and I love how open he is about it because it hard to talk about and ilysmmmm I love that you are here brave enough to do this alone !!! Also a reminder you are not boringggg and I am looking forward for the anxiety talks and so much more….know that we are here for you <3333
I'm actually really excited for anxiety talk videos, and the way he's comfortable talking about it makes me even more excited
I love the little thoughts?? Notes?? From editing Matt
the way he has to keep saying that he’s alright 😭😭😭
I love his hand movements they are so calm idk
pee in the sink lmao sorry that made me laugh
u being so open abt ur anxiety makes me more safe, ppl rlly do not talk abt it in the way it really is, feeling confused & being a teenager who just doesnt know what to do is real, ty for that <3
I am so excited about your content Matt! Been waiting all night to wake up for this. I'm so happy for the content to come, I am also excited for your mental health and anxiety journey video. I am so beyond proud of you. Thank you for being my comfort and my source of happiness your an amazing guy. I really appreciate you and your existence so much. Love you so much!!  💕

hearing you talk so openly about anxiety is such an amazing thing. I'm so proud of you. i loved the video matt, keep it up.
that was the most iconic matt ending you could have given us tbh
love you so much Matt this just made my entire day and to someone who also struggles with anxiety I’m looking forward to your upcoming videos thank you ❤️
love this matt, so proud of how far you’ve come and can’t wait for much more 🧡
i have two sibling and i know exactly how you feel. im not the same without them. i love them and they are my best friends. we always spend time with eachother and im glad you have that relationship with ur brothers too.
Listening to Matt just makes my whole month, he talks about so many things that I relate to. As much as I love the triplets's videos together, I feel like seeing them, especially Matt, come out of his shell is something special.
Matt, listen to me, you're genuinely a very funny and amusing person, but not only that, you're sweet, attentive, caring, a great friend, sibling and son. The list goes on and on, I appreciate you so much, you help us with our anxiety more than you'll ever known. Film videos that make you happy and excited, don't feel forced to upload to satisfy people, because that can be very draining. If you're proud of your content then so are we, we're here to support you through this journey no matter what, and so far it's been amazing. I hope the future brings many good memories and experiences, you deserve them. So thank you immensely for everything, and please don't talk yourself down cause you rock!!
I would love to see clothing hauls
AYOOO HAHAHAHA
no because u have to bring the kiss at the end of the videos back 🤨🤨🤨
so so proud of u💕
What is that light behind you?!
i would dm u w video ideas but like i’m rly boring and have none😭
matt i’m so proud of u. you have made a HUGGEEEE impact on a lot of people and i can’t wait to see more videos on this channel💓💓 you are so entertaining so shhhh i loved this video sm.
Sidekick all the way. Less pressure. I can’t function knowing that many people rely on me I prefer helping someone else help those people
this video was honestly incredible! i'm so proud of you matt and i'm so excited to see what else you've got in store for this channel! thank you for everything. i appreciate you and i love you so much
so excited for this new journey matt so proud!!!!
you should play scary games !
we love you matt, thank you so much for opening up. it makes us feel less alone. we support you all the way!! <3
I think the anxiety thing would be so cool. We all probably struggle with it in some form and to hear something from you would make us feel better and heard and like we’re not alone
This video is so comforting
So beyond proud of you Matt! It takes a lot of courage sitting down and talking when you have anxiety. Your a huge role model to many of us with anxiety, and even millions without. We love you so very much and couldn’t have done it without you and your brothers! So proud of you🤍
something about this video is so comforting, hearing you speak up on things is truly beautiful. i love you sm matt, i’m so proud of you <3
Hearing you be so open about your anxiety, makes me feel so comfortable because it’s really hard to find someone that you can relate and I relate to your anxiety the exact way! You did great on your first video and looking forward to getting to know you as an individual! Also I think a lot of us will enjoy content of you just talking about random topics or literally anything! Love the video :)
Matt this editing style is so fucking funny please never stop
So proud of you Matt. I don’t know what I would do without you. You don’t even know how much joy and comfort you bring people. Thank you so much for everything ❤️
I love you.
Love the video❤️
i have so much love for you matt. i appreciate how you are so real and not afraid to be yourself.   all three of you don’t really understand how much of a good impact you put on people life’s.  so many people including me found you not too long ago and have been attached ever since. i look forward to your guys videos all the time and you always end of putting a smile on my face. okay that’s all but i hope you are doing great 🫶🏼
I’m so glad you finally started your own YouTube channel, its been nice to listen to what you have to say without being interrupted by Nick and Chris ❤️ My favorite thing about this video was that he edited in destructive criticism about him talking by himself for the first time!
this was soo wholesome and not awkward at all love you and wish uou the best🫶💞
having to figure out who you are apart from the people you spend every day with is really hard but you are not boring, you fully entertained us for 18 minutes. as per the vlog suggestion, you should try to capture the things you do alone when you get to in your day to day life throughout the month and compile them, that could be an easy video:)
i love u endlessly
Excited to see more content from you!
im so proud of you matt!!!!!
I'm so excited for you and this channel Matt. We're all going to get to know you so much better and I love how you're taking this personal channel as a way to learn and grow as an individual. I'm so proud of you, and I can't wait to see what comes in the future. I will legit watch anything you put out LMAO. Love you Matt <3
Nice editing/quality  Excited to see more videos
I am loving this
You should bring back kissing the camera at the end of every video 👍
love the classic scream at the enddd

Im so proud rn, this video was very good and i loved how matt is talking and letting us know more abt him. And the way its pretty quiet without nick and chris is so weird.

Matt! Never stop doing this!! This video was the best!!
you know what i actually enjoyed watching this, i think hearing someone else talk about there problems with facing anxiety may actually help me personally and so many other people to realise that it’s ok and everyone faces some sort of mental health issue wether it’s minor or major 💙
I'm so glad you made a personal channel and I like the fact that it can be used as a learning curve for YOU as well as us!! :)
Matt this is so awesome especially talking about ur relationship with your brothers, I have a twin sister and it’s so cool hearing a similar story that I can relate to. Keep doing what you’re doing cos it’s not boring at all I promise xx
PLEASE BRING THE ENDING KISSES BACK
matt by himself is actually very comforting because i can relate to him a lot and he doesn’t talk enough with Nick and Chris
WHEN U TALKED ABOUT THE INSTRUMENTS I LOST IT THIS WAS SO FUCKING FUNNY
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
“Pickles never did anything to me” 😭
this made me more than happy matt.
I LOVED THIS, if felt like I got to just hear what you have too say and I’m grateful you made this channel❤
Matt i love your video! I really hope you post more on this channel. Also love your editing style <3

matt this was so good! i loved that it was very chill and relaxing. you could honestly put out anything and we would watch it. and don't feel pressured to post on here if you're not feeling up to it ❤️
Something about this video is so comforting ❤️
matt thank you for doing this this was so comforting to watch im so excited to see more videos from you
Man I am so proud of you Matt. I find it so funny that you say that you probably wouldn’t upload videos but you were the first to upload out of you three. I enjoyed this video a lot, it was calm and informative unlike the group channel vids. (Not that I don’t like the chaoticness lmao) but this is so good! Keep up the good work :)
I love the editing lmao so simple but the way you just keep like 'talking' with yourself is so funny
MATTTTTTTT
I think I speak for all of us when I say we love the sit down talks💗 very proud of you for getting this out Matt
they should each choose their favorite yung pleit song and make that their own intro/outro (please tell me people understand)
you’ve impacted so many people and i’m so happy for you. i love you more than words can explain. 🖤
I loved this :)) make more videos !!
i love this
u may not realise this but ur literally saving my life lol !! i def could be in a better place with my anxiety and mental health and videos like this or the ones with nick and chris make my day 🫶🏼 ur a lifesaver and i cant thank u and ur brother’s enough !
I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS
i love the fact that you’re going to talk abt anxiety. i have struggled with it since i was 4 and knowing lots of people have it makes me feel better abt it. you talking abt this brings me comfort. dont feel like ur boring us because u arent at all. i loved the video so much youre doing great. i love u sm matt ❤️❤️
i absolutely loved the video matt<3
you need to kiss the camera goodbye. okay matt? that’s what i wanna see🫶
YAYY THE SCREAMMM
oh my god matt this video was the best you really don’t know how important this is to some of us, including me. and believe me you’re never boring you’re amazing and funny and we all love you so much, you’ve already helped so many of us, keep going matt, i can’t wait to see more of your amazing solo, but also triplet videos because even when you barely speak you say the best things, love you so so much <33
Im looking forward to the whole anxiety talk because I know a lot of people, including myself, can relate and connect with you on that subject. The editing is a 10/10 btw, since you asked on your story😂
I loved this video soo much. It was great hearing Matt talk for once and finish his sentence. Im so proud of u keep up the good work ❤️❤️
so beyond proud of you.
if emma chamberlain was a boy and i love it
i love this so much 💕
Matt is so relatable tbh
Matt even that small bit you said about anxiety on cufboys helped so many people including me. I can’t even imagine how big an impact you would have talking about it more. so proud of you and can’t wait to see more love you <3
SO PROUD OF YOU MATT. we all love you and we’re so excited to see the content you’re gonna be putting out! btw, great editing 😎
This is the best video ever
Bru ik his brothers are funny and all but hearing him actually speak is so calming and helped me bc I was having a bad day I will probably watch this 20 more times and I love you💋.
i very much in joyed
it's so nice just being able to hear you speak, you have such a calm and comforting energy.
2:30 this is SENDING ME
i think it’s a great idea to do hauls and such and talk about anxiety. as someone who has anxiety i feel like no one really knows what i’m going through so i feel like if you talked about it, it would not only help us but it could also help you too ❤️👍🏼
Thank you Matt for putting your time and effort to make this video and the future ones, it’s nice for an influencer to really speak the truth about themselves because all I see now days are people saying they have a happy life and everything’s perfect, so thank you Matt for making us Happy 🥰❤️
i’m the same way about rings omg
Stop saying you’re not entertaining enough look at this!! 18min on your own!
The ending 😭😭😭 But overall the video was great
love the last clip ong
Quick suggestion you should go back to kissing the camera at the end just on here though that was one of my fav parts of old vids
BRO THE LITTLE PINK COMMENTS AFTER EVERYTHING HAS ME CREASINGGG
the "anxiety talks" are one thing i'm really looking forward to, cause hearing you talk about it makes it easier for me to not feel that bad about it
literally anything you film/talk about will be perfect, we all just love to hear you talk and hear your thoughts and opinions. so literally anything from clothing hauls to deep conversations about anxiety will be greatly anticipated and appreciated
matt i love ur channel already
aww good job
stop this automatically made my day better
I'm sitting here bawling out my eyes at how proud I am of you Matt, I'm so proud of you for trying, for taking the initiative to do this. I love this video and whenever you're ready to post again I'll be here, we'll all be here. Thank you so much for this, you started off great❤
the little comments you make on what you say is fantastic
MATT this video is so good! editing was impeccable and clothing hauls and anxiety talks would be so amazing! you talking about your anxiety is so helpful and clothing hauls would be so cool because you have such good taste !
i’ve gotten to know matt so much more by watching this
Hearing matt talk makes me feel so calm and at home
I would love to see a clothing haul!!
as someone who is struggling with anxiety it really means a lot that you are open to talk about it, you really do mean a lot to many people and have helped many as well <3 ps. i loved this video so much :)
I see so much of myself in Matt so hearing him talk about things I feel / struggle with makes me feel so much better & more comfortable with myself <3
Can u go undercover as a Sturniolo fan page hehe
I loved this video so freaking much!!! <3
You mentioned playing the cello and I immediately remembered when my class took violin lessons in year 4 and that was the best thing ever. So thank you for that
i don’t think i’ve related to someone so much. i can’t wait for the anxiety talks because that’s something i ask struggle with. really loved this video matt 🫶🏻

literally i am so proud of matt for doing his own thing and being 100% open and honest with us because it means a lot. love all 3 of them together but i really enjoyed hearing more from matt and what he has to say.
matt’s made me feel normal again. he makes having anxiety feel normal. and i think a lot of people need that. so i’m really looking forward to the anxiety talks <33
I loved every single second of this video so much 😨🫶
matt this video is perfect
Ur doing an amazing job never stop <3
Everything takes time and honestly the more use to he gets to be alone in front of the camera, the more comfortable he’ll be! And I’m 1000000% excited to see what he does in the future <3
Don't feel pressured to post a lot on this channel, just post whenever you feel like it. We will be happy with any content, i promise you're not a boring person, you make a lot of us happy:) take care, ly♡♡♡

this literally was not awkward at all idk what he was talking ab before this was posted 🤨
Matt, you aren't boring :)
i am so proud of you matt
Not Matt saying that whatever he says sounds depressing but me relating to it all
awe i loved it definitely the anxiety idea you help a lot of people when you mentioned it on the podcast i hope your happy with the way it turned out bc i am!!
here's what i think of this video: the editing was rlly good! i liked the vid a lot and i think you're gonna do great. I'm so proud of you<3
Definitely, some clothing hauls you always have good fits, personal vlogs and  even a day in your life like when you get in the car to go somewhere just bring the camera and film lol
Matt is literally my favorite person on this whole planet! I love him so much and I’m so happy he is willing and open about talking about his anxiety. I have such bad anxiety and he really makes me so happy!!
gotta love the iconic scream as the outro
so proud of you matt. i think the anxiety talks are an amazing idea because i feel like people sometimes feel alone in that type of stuff.
I love you endlessly Matt <33
you did an amazing job matty b!
If u are comfortable enough with the kiss at the end, itll be great and if u dont its completely ok. Ly!
You aren’t boring Matt!! I’d literally listen to you talk about anything lol
MATT FOR THE OUTRO YOU HAVE TO KISS THE CAMERA
this video was honestly so great, it’s so enjoyable hearing you talk about this stuff. it’s comforting
The unexpected scream I love it 😅
NAHH THAT WAS GOOOOOOODDDD
Ur amazing! I love you🌸
matt is so comforting abt anxiety in general it helps me alot, im sure it helps alot of ppl:)<3
I have loved the video. It's been a while since I started seeing you and your brothers, and from the beginning I always felt more identified with you, I don't know if it's because I also have anxiety or because I have a personality similar to yours. I love that you're going to talk about anxiety because I feel that sometimes people don't give it too much importance. By the way, I really like how you've edited the video :) (I'm sorry if I've made any spelling mistakes, I'm from Spain and sometimes it's hard for me to write in English) 💕💕
Pls do more Q&As!!!💜💜💜
Matt, this video was so good! I loved being able to hear your full sentences 😂 plus you did a great job with the editing!
I love how comfortable you are about talking about your anxiety and you have helped me so much this is definitely my new comfort video <3
i love you matt!
BRING BACK CAMERA KISSES
Omg everything you said YES it made perfect sense to me
yeah you should definitely talk about your anxiety because other people could relate to your personal feelings and things like that
I LOVE YOU MATT

The editing was so simple but so funny!!

“Damn I was blowing everything”-Matt sturniolo💪

you talking about anxiety will help a lot because i feel like most ppl don’t rlly talk about it and when they do and it’s all like quick and brief and no one that i’ve ever rlly enjoyed listening to has talked about it and i find you guys rlly comforting so that’s nice to know someone i love has it too and can relate also i love listening to you talk without being interrupted bc we are able to listen to you more and learn more about you better!!

matt talking about his anxiety so openly is so amazing because there are so many people that feel alone when it comes to stuff like that and he just makes everyone feel like they are safe and not alone. i love him.
Really liked this, just a like a little facetime :)  Btw forgetting everything is very relatable 😀
HAHA WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE INSTRUMENTS HE PLAYED GROWING UP 😭😭
literally had to grab a snack for this
13:44 “damn i was blowing everything” LMAOO
matt your editing is fire fr
the editing is good matt!!  the way you edited the video kept me entertained and it was funny too, and also wasn’t too much or over the top :))  you did good!
Yes we NEED anxiety talks, you are the only influencer that I have heard express about your anxiety and it has helped become more comfortable with my anxiety.
“that sounded so sad i promise i’m fine” AWH
💙
i was smiling and laughing through this whole video 🥺😂
im so proud od u matt !! this was amazing <3
If your ever driving by urself h could vlog it
matt i can assure you that you are not boring at all, even if you are not talking about "funny" things, the way you talk and explain things is so entertaining and makes me be interested in whatever your talking about, even if i don't like that thing, i dont know if i explained the right way but yeah
You actually didn’t know how much I was looking forward to this, made my day❤ You’re so comforting <3

matt:🧙‍♂️🎻

the random pick subtexts are so funny
WIZARD MATTHEW
The amount of comfort you bring to me whenever I watch you and ONLY you talking is just amazing.
17:23 babes i subscribed the second you posted about it
damn i was blowing everything 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 cant breathe u funny man
I really enjoyed your first video! Thank you. I'm glad you're doing alright. My heart goes out to anyone struggling with their mental health. I know that anxiety/depression is hard and frustrating. Please know that you're not alone and it's ok to not be ok. It will get better it may take time but things do get better <3
THIS WAS SO GOOD 💕
Awwh Matt, use this channel how you want and how you feel comfortable! we'll always be here to support you and we're always proud of you!!!! also editing 10/10, very proud of you
Dude this was so good
loved this video!
Could you also do some form of art? Maybe painting and just talking or trying to take photos? Or maybe do a poser board of a topic you're interested in??
This was really good and editing was on point
i acc love u sm
It’s crazy to here you talk by yourself and at the same time so comforting!! 😭
18 full minutes of just matt talking is going to be absolutely amazing
loved the way you edited👌👌👌
The other thing was pranks matt
i totally understand everything your saying
reacting to fan edits and art as a video idea!
matt you truly make me so happy and you saying you’re going to talk more about your anxiety,etc cause it’s going to help so many of us in so many ways you don’t understand. i also personally love just hearing you speak alone and cannot wait for more videos of you just sitting down and talking by yourself.
I loved this video with my whole heart! I feel like (this is gonna sound sooooo cheesy) but i really feel like I got to know you so much better! I love you Matt!❤️🥰
the iN-Ternet💀💀💀

Matt you are seriously the most comforting person ever, and no matter how many videos you will post or what they are going to be about, we as toyr fans will love them because we love you for you. you have a great impact on so many people and you are such a great role model. i love that you are so open about your anxiety because so many people fight with it on their own so its nice to hear how someone else feels about it. i hope you know that we dont think your boring you are amazing just the way you are<33 love you
I feel like a clothing haul would be such a good video and anxiety isn’t talked about enough and I love your personality I don’t think you are boring I just personally think you are definitely going to find what you enjoy by yourself and as a individual cause without my brother I don’t know who I would be he is my other half so I get what you mean and I loved this video and I love you sm ❤️‍🩹😁😇
I'd really like to see anxiety videos from you, it's not that I have anxiety but a lot of my friends have and with you talking about it and explaining it, I'm gonna be able to learn more about it in general which I think would be really helpful so yeah :)
matt If you see this just know that you’re not boring, like genuinely you don’t realise how effortlessly funny you are
anything you do on this account i will 100% watch it and enjoy it and appreciate that you took the time to edit it and everything. love you so much💗

nick seems like the guy to drink pickle juice i cant lie
I LOVE THE EDITING MATT
Hearing someone else open up about there anxiety or any issues that you relate to just makes it so much easier to deal with it. Even if it’s just things you can do to help it or Situations you can relate to. it makes you feel more confident in it instead of being ashamed in something you can’t help. Love the way you open up too everyone keep striving<3
this was the best thing ever
DUDE MY STEP DAD DRINKS PICKLE JUICE 😭😭
the way i have the exact same thought process. oh my god.
matt you're so funny stop acting like you aren't
if u end up talking about ur anxiety i think that would be amazing and might help a lot of people including me
“damn I was blowing everything” IM PISSING MY PANTS😭😭😭
Matt please do videos about anxiety
18 mins of Matt reassuring us he’s NOT depressed🙌🙌
Matt I’m sooo proud of you I loved the Video <3
you’re literally anything but boring. this video is exactly what we needed. tysm. we support and love you sm.
Matt this video was literally so entertaining I loved it
Pickle juice ain't gooddont come for me
Wait Matt is mad funny dafuk
my brother has a cat named pickles
first thing i noticed in this video is when i saw a guy walk behind him and he locked the doors!!!
YES CLOTHING HAULS
You made me want a pickle 😂
maybe you could go to different drive throughs and rate all kinds of (fast) foods since you’re the only one that can drive, so you have your own little personal thing
i love the edits sm they are so funny 😭
dude i loved this video, just talking and calm and chill. i love how much i relate w you, you’re helping a lot of ppl:)
the way matt has helped me with so much just genuinely makes life so much easier  so proud of Matt <3
GAMING VIDS PLEASEEEEE
im so proud of you matt.
It was so funny the way he edited AHSHSHSHAHHAHAHAHAHA U SLAYED MATT
i 100% understand matt, like when somebody brings something up, then you think of one thing, then another, then you remember something you didn't remember, but then you did remember... that made zero sense
14:34 it does make sense 15:06
this is so great, down to earth, hilarious and interesting
"damn i was blowing everything" LMAOOOO
i really like this type of video, i dont think its awkward at all. You need to believe in your self boy🕺. You are funnier and more interesting than you think 😅
I loved the q&a sm
… i drink pickle juice out of the jar 🤨
kid entered his slay era*   *matt being able to say a sentence without being cut off
If you upload video once a month I will be just as happy, you are not boring I like to hear you talk about anything or if you want to make videos playing, I will watch and enjoy every second. We love you Matt
PLS THE START MADE ME LAUGH SM
nah cuz this video is so calming to me like i enjoyed just sitting down and just watching it if that makes sense lol
love how you’re doing your own thing matt
Yes to clothing hauls and anxiety talks (and if you could the attachment issues)
Omg I really want you to talk about anxiety, social anxiety cuz it would make me feel better and Matt you are like my safe place so I would be really grateful if you talk about it in the next videos❤️
matt this video was absolutely adorable!! im inlove
“damn i was blowing everything” LMFAO THAT SENT ME 😭😭😭
10/10 video. Matt, you slayed<3
i love how open you are about your feelings/anxiety ilysm🫶🏻
we love u matty b
YES WHEN SOMEONE MENTIONS SOMETHING AND YOU GET SUPER HAPPY BECAUSE IT BRINGS BACK ALL THESE MEMORIES
matt i know you think you're boring but you're really not and i can't tell you how excited i am for anxiety videos, i think they're gonna help a lot of people including myself and i'm really glad it's a chance to normalize the topic! you're gonna do great on this channel don't even worry about it :)
I CANNNOT MATT I LOVE YOUR EDITING
i love this video so much and i’m so glad that you’re going to do videos about anxiety as hearing you talk about it and give advice helps not just me but so many people<3
Love this so much! You aren’t boring at all, and it’s good to hear about your anxiety it makes me feel not alone !
Love this video matt and please talk about anxiety and like hauls and other video idea and so ready for the next one🤍😊
proud and happy for you 🤍
u r amazing ily
the pop ups with the editing is hilarious
like a lot of ppl in the comments are saying, thanks so much for being so open about your anxiety. ik our generation is a lil more chill about mental health and being kind to all but you never rlly have someone to look up to on social media, only just those around you :)
omgg he is giving emma’s vibes
no cause him talking about what he played and adding text has me crying
You talking on your own is really nice, it feels like im really bonding with you and getting to know you better <3 Also im dealing with anxiety to and im excited to hear you give your perspective and talk about it :)
I DIDNT GET THE NOTIF
watching u in my chemistry class on college
Those anxiety videos would help so so so much, it’s nice to have you speak up about it
“pickles never did anything to me. if you don’t like ‘em, don’t eat ‘em” ~ matt sturniolo 2022
It feels so weird not hearing nick and chris's voice right after matt says something lol but matt, you're doing great and i loved this video 🖤
the memory thing, i know exactly what you mean, it’s so good to suddenly get those memories like free serotonin
i love how he says “yur ” and not “your” i feel so seen LMAOO
Facts with the pickle fact
the “damn i was blowing everything” got me howling
“pickles never did anything to me” 😭
YAYYY finally, i loved it, it's so nice to hear you talk about serious topics and you can really see how mature you are, thanks matt 🤍
editor matt is my new favourite person (so proud btw!!)
I love this! <3 you make such an impact on everyone through these videos
The comments in the middle of the video are everything, im laughing so much
this. this is free therapy
yall im late to this
matt the editing of this is so good <3
"Pickles never did anything to me"🤣
i loved this so much
I’d love to hear you talk about anxiety more. Being a 13 year old who has had anxiety for majority of their life, Hearing more about your experiences and strategies would help
I love your editing lmao it's so funny 😭😭
the way you speak on anxiety is so comforting. it helps to know that i’m not alone with dealing with it, and it’s so nice to see someone being so open about their experience with things like anxiety <3
So random and you definitely won’t see this butttttt I know EXACTLY what you mean about attachment issues because I have major attachment issues with my older brother and he just left home and now I do things by myself and sometimes I just can’t handle it. Glad someone else understands, thanks Matt.
“Damn I was blowing everything” 😭
Please do an anxiety video
matt you did great. everything about this video was great I love you (also you told us to tell you if we liked the editing and I personally did so there’s that!) <3
I LOVE YOU MATT
your editing style is so funny lmao i love it !!
I appreciate the fact that he’s going to talk abt anxiety, because I have VERY bad social anxiety and I hate going out in public, but I do it anyways because I’m forced and I didn’t want people to know I hat it, but thanks to Matt he helped me realize it’s okay <3
Matt this video is great! We’re all so proud of you and I’m so interested to watch your videos to come! Especially the anxiety ones because I suffer from it and it’s nice to hear from other people, especially since you brought up you have driving anxiety in the cuffboys podcast (I can relate very much). The editing was great as well! One thing that you brought up is trying to be entertaining and that should be the last thing you’re worried about! I honestly just like to watch as a way to escape and for something to do whether it’s entertaining or not!
you're awesome matt!!!!!! i love u and u did a wonderful job with the editing😜😜 and it wasn't awkward like you said because i felt all the emotions possible in one video😭❤ #SLAYJOR
NO I AGREE W U ON THE RINGS. MY FINGERS FEEL CLAUSTROPHOBIC AND IRRITATED BECAUSE I PLAY W THEM ALL THE TIME
matt talking about how he went through like four instruments is giving the same energy as nick crying and quitting every sport in existence 💀💀
I played the trumpet in grade 7
I HATE when you say your boring because it’s the very last thing I’d think of you ! Your so interesting we wouldn’t be here if we thought otherwise. Your just an introvert ! you Nick and Chris all have your own traits and yous shine even more when yous are together and that’s what we love about yous <3
he needs to bring back kissing the camera for the outro <3
I can’t with all this elevator music💀
I WANT THE VIDEO GAMES CONTENT
Matt, I kinda relate to you because I can’t do things by myself is like terrifying for me, but I recently I started a YouTube channel because you guys were one of my inspirations to do it, I think that I could be very boring alone too, I need people around me to like, let it out my personality, but I 100% believe that you are not boring Matt, you just need get to know yourself more, but I’m so happy that you got the motivation to started, loveu Matty b🫶🏻
a video where youre talking abt anxiety would be really epic
a wizard at cello 😎
Your sarcasm is unmatched
Tbh I'm here for your editing
damn matt you were blowing everything 😭😭
I think what you mean is like your always around chris and nick and when you guys do stuff it’s always together so you feel awkward or unusual not being with them all the time
we love you matty b 💗
i am obsessed w ur editing
you‘re doing amazing!🫶🏼
No because that memory thing makes perfect sense
13:23 HAHAHAHHA
Matt u r amazing, and this video was rlly interesting to watch. U r not boring not even in the slightest. We look forward to hearing more from/about u ❤️
The editing was perfect. This video was amazing Matt ❤️ Loved just listening to you talk
woah matt talking for 18 mins straight without being interrupted
I love hearing Matt talk. I could literally watch videos of him talking about the most random shit all day and be happy
yes please talk about anxiety i feel like that would help a lot of people along with yourself
as someone who deals with constant anxiety, you talking about it makes it so meaningful:( you're so precious matt<3
I love the little comments on the screen
hello matthew
It was so nice to see just you and get to know you more, hope you make another one soon but dont be stressed about it, take ur time and we all love you :)
bro was really blowing in everything
It’s so nice hearing you talk about anxiety it helps me so much to have someone understand and to know your not alone
being able to see this side of Matt makes me so happy I literally feel like I’m talking to him face to face
The little editing anecdotes have me DYING
Definitely would love to hear about your anxiety struggles, I struggle with it too!
I think its a good idea to do anxiety talks, a lot of ppl can relate to you <3
This vid has me dying of laughter 😭😭
Dammm u be blowing everything recently hahha
I totally get it with attachments bc I have it with my cousins, my best friend and my mom lmfao is really hard and super weird w out them at certain situations, is like you don’t know what to do with yourself and you realize how boring you are lmfaoo
I’ve been waiting all day for this video! I love how open you about anxiety, as someone who also has really bad anxiety it makes me feel safe ❤️
It totally made sense lmao
I have the same feeling when I wear rings which kinda sucks because I like them but oh well :)
trying new things from fast food places are nice videos!!
hearing matt talk about anxiety is the best cos its not talked abt enough so him tlking abt it will impact a lot of people
omfg am so proud of you matt<33 Deadass had the laptop open from 11: 00 to watch this and am vvv excited
so,proud of you Matt wooooo first vid was amazing love you so much can’t wait for the anxiety talks bc I already know it’ll comfort everyone who goes through such things :) editing is great too btw 💕

Anxiety talk and clothing hauls/jewellry tour >>>>>
The “anxiety talk” content is something i am really looking forward to. As someone who struggles with anxiety, it is honestly a huge thing knowing that someone i really look up to goes through what i do. I am looking forward to learning about you (and your brothers) more as an individual and I’m incredibly proud of you and I’m beyond excited to see what the future holds for you guys!
2:02 anyone else notice the person walking behind the car and then matt locking the doors lmao
A few days ago I had an awful axintey attack and you helped me calm myself down
TE AMO
THE EDITING IS INCREDIBLE 😭😭😭
I’m so excited to watch this! I hope you know how important you are to so many people. I could write paragraphs about how you saved my life but we would be here forever. I’m so proud of you and everything you Nick and Chris have accomplished. You guys bring me so much joy and happiness. I love you so much Matt and I’m so proud <3
i love you so much fr ❤❤❤❤❤
It is strange to see him alone but it is nice to get some time with just Matt
the inside thoughts connected with the elevator music are sooo funny lmao
why was him talking about learning the recorder so funny
i think it will be a great idea to talk ab ur anxiety, it would help some people;)
matt editing ‘damn i was blowing everything’ im crying hahahahahahaha

This is amazing Matt, we all really enjoyed it, and we are all so proud of you! 🫶
this is so cute
honest, genuine review, i am not even like half way through the video and i appreciate this so much. im glad you can get out of your comfort zone a bit. this actually gave me such more inspiration to start my own channel. i feel confident enough to share my story and thank you for that. you doubt yourself too much, you did absolutely amazing for your first video alone. it was not as awkward as you though, youre so unintentionally funny. this is going to help so many other people and i cant even explain how proud of you i am. love you!

anxiety talks from Matt will actually make me embrace my anxiety so much more and make me feel so much more calmer about it, would definitely love too see something like that 💙
i LOVE that ironic messages from editor matt to youtuber matt
editing style ate cant wait to see more :)
no but why is the clostraphobia ring thing so relatable
I love this u should really make a vid on ur anxiety I struggle with it a lot and u have helped very much it’s hard to talk to people abt it but I would love to hear u talk about it <3
i’m so happy that your opening up about your anxiety and bringing attention to what it’s like having anxiety. As someone who suffers with anxiety i am so proud to see you open up and share about things that i myself feel on the daily. IM SO PROUD OF YOU!!!
the way that you open up abt your anxiety helps me feel so much more comfortable with it. ilysm matt ♥️♥️♥️
THIS IS MY NEW COMFORT VIDEO 😭
do video games
happy to hear you're happy matt!!
I wish you continue this, we also get to know each of you better on your personal channels.
He explained the whole sibling thing perfect, I’m super close with my brother and sister. When I spend time away from them it’s weird 😂 🤍
I love this matt
It would be fun if you did vlogs by yourself of like trying new things... kinda just stuff that you don’t usually do alone cuz even tho I’m not a triplet I relate to not wanting to do things all by myself
you are the most amazing person and you don’t have to think yourself that you are entertaining it’s not about that it’s like having a friend you know i just love listening to you and your day i don’t care about how entertaining or perfect the vid is you make me feel safe i love you so much matt!!❤️
Out of matt chris and nick I definitely relate to matt the most with anxiety and how he mentioned in this feeling like kinda bland and I understand that so much cuz I feel like that a lot and I am also quite open with my anxiety too and I really like just having someone to relate to with it yk
You’re not boring I swear this was so entertaining
I’m so happy this video came as fast as it did
it’s so comforting being able to listen to you individually! <3 really proud of you for speaking out about struggling with anxiety, matt. love you
matt this is one of my favorite videos i’ve ever seen
Keep going matt
Omggg I’m so happy that you posted on your own ❤️
finally get to hear matt finish his sentences😭
matt we’re all so proud of you for posting! I loved this video
i loved this so much! i feel like in a lot of the car talk videos i never get to hear from you enough and this was really nice! also you have no idea how much of an impact you have on all of our happiness this video just fully brightened my day so thank you.
Honestly Matt, you have helped me so much with my anxiety so that I feel comfortable talking about it, and I’m extremely happy that we can finally get to know you and your personality better.
No because the music when you put texts in the video remindes me of the clyde and matt live stream and you guys put ”waiting music”
You make me feel so safe and I love it
i’m so proud of u matt i love u so much 🫂
i for sure know matt has anxiety bc of how much he’s downplaying it but it’s actually part of him everyday . twinning
I would love anxiety talks. Especially how you would cope with them since I struggle with it too.
I love you sm <3
why do i relate to him so much, this is scary
honestly whatever content you decide to post, i’ll watch it. 💕
Thank you for being so open about everything :) we love uuu
He is the cutest person ever 😭😭😭

We love you nick!
matt we love u sm, i promise u aren’t boring
This literally made my day 💗
I'm extremely proud about you opening up about your axintey
I cant wait to see Matt grow on this channel
yes clothes hauls!!! yes anxiety talk my own suggestion: react to tiktoks/edits abt yourself
i promise you could post 20 minutes of you saying one word for the whole video and it would not be boring
the editing is everything
you’re never boring !! excited for your monthly uploads, love youuu 🤍
You and your brothers make me so happy. I had a rlly rough day and this made me feel sm better. Especially you talking about anxiety, that helps so many people realize it’s okay to not feel okay sometimes. ily <3
„5‘8 on a good day“ PLS THIS IS SO FUNNY
the editing: 100/10 matty boy🫶
i cant even express in words how proud me and everyone else watching are. we love you matt and i promise we will watch anything you give us lol. i really like the clothing and jewelry hauls/tour ideas bc ur style has inspired me a lot its kind of insane. anyways, whatever you want to talk about, we are here to listen. also ur editing was 10/10
This is a great video Matt 👍💓
Absolutely loved this and I’m so excited for more videos 🤍🤍
I’m so excited for the anxiety talks <3

You don’t need to be entertaining, just be yourself!

Pls the toilet thing is actually so relatable sometimes I’ll get anxiety for the stupidest shit and end up convincing myself that I WILL DIE (very dramatic) if I don’t sleep on my right side or something 👩‍🦲
Love you so so much! I love how open you are about stuff. You should for sure post more!! So proud of you!1
I love the editing lmaoo
I love you babes for wanting to open up and talk about your anxiety, almost everyone I watch and know don’t prefer to talk about their anxiety, but you doing that is amazing❤️❤️
I LOVE THIS lmao this is so entertaining tbh
why is this vidoe literally just matt being the middle triplet for 18 minutes
Matt is so underrated and it’s most likely because of the fact nick and Chris are always really energetic and loud and personally I relate to him a lot because I always seem to get interrupted really bad anxiety and the fact he is doing this with anxiety is amazing he has grown so much and I love him and tbh I always feel better after watching them on yt ❤️❤️❤️ And it’s really nice to not see him get interrupted when he is talking I love him so much (I love all three of u)❤️❤️❤️  Also I relate to the recorder story bc I never learned how to play bc I’m lazy and my dad had 2 of them and I would always just piss everyone off   Just an fyi Christopher you are not boring!!   Imma start have to start saying ‘how on gods Green earth’ I love it ❤️❤️
i love the editing LMAO
The little messages in between are so funny but honestly this video is so relatable and entertaining
Good job for ur first time editing a video 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I love this video sm
Matt you do what ever you want to do, we will watch whatever you put out. Love you 🤍
i don’t think any of them realize that no matter kind of videos the put out, we will like them, even if they think it’s boring.
good for matt for literally being the first one to post a video tbh cause he said he made one like a week ago and hes already provided 🙏

matt, i get it. i NEED my siblings, i happen to have 2 siblings.. one twin brother and one sister thats only a year younger than us, so it's almost like we are triplets because of how close in age we are, so i feel like if I'm away from them for more than a week id be so sad

YAY MATTT
i'd love anxiety videos and playing video games tbh
I love how he’s going to start talking about the anxiety and him going through Anxiety because I go through anxiety a lot and just hearing from other peoples perspective could help me or others a lot
kid thinks we wouldn’t watch him talk about anything. like u don’t have to be funny or shit like just talk and we’ll watch it.
Yes pls share your experience with anxiety, I think some of us will need this :)
what i think you meant to say matt was that you have separation anxiety when it comes to chris and nick vs being alone queen but the explanation wasn’t that bad😭
I love how matt locks the door EVERY time he sees something moving outside in any video I have watched with him in it. I am so proud of him though and I can't wait to see what he does with his channel.
We are so proud of you Matt! You have made a huge impact on so many people and helped so many people! We all love you❤️
take your time matty b
i feel like we’re on facetime
video games would be fire

THE EDITING IS SO FUCKING FUNNY AND CUTE MATT ILY
MATT thats the cutest thing ever, i love uuuu
i love the anxiety talks topic
this is so cool! i love matt so much this makes me so happy we get to his the style of videos he’ll make himself and being able to reach a whole new audience as well and inspire so many others including me. Also can we appreciate the fact that he said he would touch on anxiety and it is so sweet and I am so ready because I really love how much I can relate to Matt through having really bad anxiety as well. He is literally thw one person that I look up to that helps me with my anxiety struggles because he has them too. And when he talks about feeling weird without Nick and Chris it warms my heart. The seperation anxiety is something I can relate to with family as well so I truly love Matt for being so honest as to admit he has separation anxiety from them always being together. I wish I was a triplet too because that is just so heartwarming.
