It's 2025 - September. And I miss this series
But why
4 YEARS LATER AND WE STILL NEED THIS SERIES!!!!
I am so proud of Alexis for always making actual meals and never copping out on the meal because the items are too hard to work with
Bring back these plzzzz plzzz
anybody 2024?
Man you know they are checking this out in prison. Gotta make that food as fancy as possible.
Toothpicks
Rie and Alexis never taste tested each other's foods on these shows.  When will it happen?
I think she says "i think this is the greatest meal ive ever made" in every video.😂
Can she make a 3-course meal with either a emulsion blender,bunsen burner , candle , fondue pot
The beginning of the video: do not try this at home Alexis at the end: let me know if you try this at home!   No hate. I love her!
I know this video is old but Alexa is very nice and very very impressed. I said the biggest challenge you had was with the power tools but this actually shocks me more trying to say that I would do this I would I use my own hair tools but when I turned it as you are but you amaze me😮😮😮🎉🎉🎉😮
Please try doing one with an electric lunchbox. I am so curious as to how that would go.
autoclave episode when
Cook 3 course meal with ramen on stove top Next video ramen on microwave Ramen on solar
A stove??
Does anyone else notice that Alexis has like 3 different voices? It's like the excited voice which is moderately high Then the doubtful voice which is kinda squeaky And then the 'I am out of ideas and tired' voice which is very deep. 🌹🌺
Shuriken.. always watching waiting to strike..
I personally loved this series of chef out of water. It was really amazing. I was hoping to see an episode where alexis attempts to make a three course meal on a crepe iron.
Alexis is so beautiful
Im so sorry but u look like amber Heard 😭
Can this chef make a 3 course meal with test tubes and a bunsen burner
I first found out about cooking with a hair straightener and water dispenser in a movie called “Our Shining Days”. It’s a Chinese movie based on a competition between Western instruments (violin, harp, piano) and traditional Chinese instruments (yanqin (?)). It was free on YouTube when I watched it, idk if it is still now.
Seriously what happened to people trying it and guessing what things they used why did they change it they should have reactions and if they dont have people to try it would still be nice for one of the camera crue or someone to give there opion on what shes done shes already tried evrything while doing it.
Tell me whyyyy she looks like my school's principal 😭
*flashes back to good mythical morning making pancakes on a hair straightener*
If Tasty fires Alexis, Alvin, and Rie the channel would go downhill
Can this chef make a 3- course meal with a blow torch?
"food" and "hair" should never appear at the same time. Obviously this is an expection
I love that the real oven was right there and she didn't cheat! HA!  I love this series so much!
I wanna like to taste chocolate- covered strawberries 🍓😋
I suggest making food with a wax pot like the pot you use to melt wax beads
I feel like she says something along the lines of "this might be the best thing I've ever made" in every single one 😂 which might be true but I just find it funny
alexis: "it's not perfect.... 10/10"
A hair straightner can get up to 450 degrees?!
Imao I got an add for a hair dryer after the video 😂
Tasty’s makin’ it small
Once covid gets better, can we have guests back? The really made the show better
Those are not Blini but Oladushki, normaly you do it it Kefir instead of backing powder
Can she cook just using the sun on a hot summer day? Like using reflectors to focus the suns heat? I don't know if it's possible. And a space heater, a hot stone
This girl is a cooking goddess..."no lie"😉
Oh my goodness**
Dear God what the hell is this
Please try cooking with an easy bake oven
I Just hope no one's going to ask you to do a Zippo lighter
pretty cool video do one only using gladiator flip flaps
I’m 10000% convinced there’s nothing this woman can’t do👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
She should make a 3 course meal with Wax Melter.
alix, rie, alexis and alvins backs must be in agony for carrying tasty
Lovvveee itttttttt
5 minute crafts: write that down! Write that down!!!!!!!
If anything this particular episode taught me, it was to stop straightening my hair because I’m literally cooking it lol 😂
A real challenge would be for her stop cooking fish with random appliances... With the exception of chicken she's mostly made fish here!
You're so cool 😎
Is wanna eat them all!!! 🤤
I have the same straighter
this is definitely the most impressive one
Never stop
You guys should make a remake version of this show where you make these same dishes how you would actually make them with regular equipment.
She should make a meal with just a pan, no stove or anything, just the heat from the sun.
are these meals for a baby? what are these tiny portions
I would like to see her have a menu before she knows what she is cooking with.  Like she gets all her ingredients and then the box is opened and it's got the power tools in it
When you're at a hotel and your friend screams across the room to you to make food.
The fact that theres no-one to taste it is just sad : (
Multicoocker
3:42 as a Russian, I feel offended now 👁👄👁 Fellow Russians will understand
As i Russian i can confidently say that 3:37 this is absolute waffle ngl  Blini are just normal pankakes which can be eaten with anything.usually they are like crepes. So what she is making( The mini stuff) is scalled oladyi (оладьи) and those are more like american pankakes but can be made from porriges and eaten with toppings as well.
Toaster
Alexis is not a real person she’s a robot
y does Alexis always looks like she is about to cry
They should get a show on netflix or sum
The Sandwich for sure!
Can we just get more of her 🥺 how I miss her
WE NEED THIS SERIES BACK @TASTY
Where is Alexis😶?
Use a deep fryer
She did really good I’m impressed
a little bit alexis
Just the fact that I have watched every single video in this playlist 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
Did she cook the salmon?
How about an egg boiler?
Please do deep fryer
What about electric heater next time??
Cook a 3 course meal in a Hot Car
I recommend you Ms.Yeah
Where is the " Chef out of the water" 😦😦😦
Nothing but a kitchen torch?   Popcorn maker?   Bread maker?   Electric kettle?  Sous vide?

Sandwich
Bliny is actually usually very large and thin more like crêpes
make 3 course meal with a fan
Please make more of these Tasty!
Can this chef make a 3 course meal with a car.
I love this series so much! ❤️
I can see that tasty is running out of content....... May god bless you guys and send some new ideas in your useless minds......
I'd love to see her make one with hotpot/slowcooker
yknow as a non-American hearing you say you can't do much with 140 degrees for a hair drying is worrying
Alexis’s new favorite word: “Color!”
Blender and blow torch
You should use survival tool (flint and steel, chain saw, para cord, etc..)
I LOVE THIS
Hi Alexis i suggest you try to cook using water heater. Goodluck
Hey! You didn't rate the strawberries
She gives me HUGE Addison Montgomery-Shepherd vibes y'all
As a Russian, I’m like, in what world are blini small?? 🗿
God is good!!! :)))
Do a kettle next!
P.S., My favourite part of this meal is the chocolate-covered strawberries.
Plot twist; there was a mix-up at Buzzfeed, and then some poor souls were left trying to figure out how to style hair with a cooking appliance.
whos gonna tell her that blini are not small and look like crepes?
Alexis should do an episode with a fondue pot lmao
140°C can burn things
TRY AN SANDWICH MAKER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE I BEG YOU
Start the next season already 😭
Next do a 3 course meal with candy melting pot
you should cook with a stand mixer
Need another season
She should make a 3 course meal with a kettle
Why hasn't a new episode been uploaded please don't tell me this series is finished. I've been binging this show 26 times in quarantine
No wonder nobody likes your voice
Super  women  Alexis:  can do anything  along  with using anything  Rie  :the fairy  God mother  to save the clueless Alix: learn the hard way  but just don't   stop learning
Dry ice
Do with dry ice
Use  a crockpot please, thank you
Use the sun!!!
...
She didn't rate the strawberries...
Use a microwave for your next video

I MISS THIS SERIES SO MUCHHHH

I don't like their new kitchen:( but.. love the video:D
She should do an espresso machine
Wow
Make a dish using a candle 🕯or the machine from which u dry your nail polish with ( can't remember name of the machine 😅) .
I hope they do this series again :(( it just so fun and some of them are helful :'
my sister who is in college: WRITE THAT dOWN WRITE THAT DOWN
Can you make a video using sunlight
Next do a deep fryer
Since they are the two most experienced and resourceful chefs, I think it'd be fun to make Rie and Alexis exchange shows for a day: Rie would be Chef Out of Water and Alexis would have to Make It Fancy.
Watching this while drying my hair lol
Can you do something with  a guitar, lol I know you won’t do it 😂
1:10 - "140°, not much you can do with that"  Me, a European: sigh
Can you make a 3 course meal using a thermal cooker....it's going to be a loooooong cooking time
Yo tasty when is the next season of chef out of water coming out . C'mon it's been 4 months . Out of ideas ? Here are some-   •Can this chef make a 3 course meal using a car engine  •Can this chef make a 3 course meal using a hand blender (she's always asking for one )  •Can this chef make a 3 course meal using candle flame  •Can this chef make a 3 course meal using a solar cooker ( summer's almost here)  •Can this chef make a 3 course meal using only a sous vide machine
Alvin- make it big Rie- make it fancy Inga- make it trendy Alexis- make it difficult
Sorry but blini are NEVER this small irl. They are like crepes, they are literally crepes, they are large. So i don't get why you say they are small anyway  I'm Russian so i know
Dramatic shi# Someone else should taste the dishes not the cook themselves. What a bluff.
Where did ya find creme fresh, smoked salmon? In a black hole? This isn't a challenge. Make those things by the hair tools, then call it a challenge.
Who got a love beauty and planet ad before the vid
Way to cut Mia off
"Can this chef make a 3-course meal with a sandwich maker?"                        OR "Can this chef make a 3-course meal with a food processor?" (She can make a cheese-cake ;)
"Can this chef make a 3-course meal with a sandwich maker?" Would be cool...
My confidence about this is high. My feeling of safety around a hair straightener plummeted.
Cook in a car engine please
Blue cheese?
You should do a toaster next. :)
Whos here in 2021?   !
❤️❤️

cooking with only hand mixer will be pretty awesome :D
Hey Tasty team could you possibly add subtitles in multiple languages?
car engine!! like this if you agree
use water heater, like this if you agree
What if you try to make a 3 course meal with a candle (a unscented one of course) use as much candles as you can to help!
Cook 3 courses meal with matchsticks.. 😋 Little bit difficult but small suggestions.. You can use max 7 match stick at one time 😁❤️
Alexis, Alvin, Rie, Alix, Hannah and Inga are the reason why I'm here and they're the main people at Tasty
pls make a 3 course meal from a food processer
She’s the most confident chef

It’s weird how she makes great meals with the weirdest appliances, but really weird looking meals with regular appliances.

I want to try doing the sandwiches
FRIDGES ARE NOT HAIR SUPPLIES. Just saying.
Bring it back
"Hello guys, I'm Alexis, the chef who is always up for a challenge!" Famous last words. . . .
Can you make a 3 course meal using:  -Pasta maker -a combination of appliances used so far eg. Power tools and hair tools - mortar and pestle - spice grinder - smoothie maker - juicer - water boiler - potato masher (electric and non-electric) - handmixer - heater - humidifier
3 course meal in an indoor fireplace? Or I even heard you can bake cookies on a car dashboard when its hot [ although, it takes a while], so maybe 3 course meal on a sunny car dashboard?
In this the strawberry is nice
oki, how about  m food with only a hairdryer nothing else :3
Deep fryer
Pizza oven
Waffle maker
Make a video cooking with a toaster
Unbelievable!!! She is really really talented 👏👏👏👏 Tasty please don’t stop this show pls🙂🙂🙂

The thumbnail tho  The thing in your right hand looks mighty scary
When you are russian and you know that "blinis" should be thin and the size of a regular pan and Russians will never eat creme fraiche with salmon at the same dish....😖😖😖
Can they make a 3 course meal using a thing that u can put stuff on top and it's long?
Kettle next!
I like how she praises herself.She knows she’s good but she doesn’t know that she is better than she thinks
Electric kettle ?
There goes my tissue box
Why are you doing this to Alexis? Whyyyyyyyyyy
3 course meal with matchboxes
How about using a Magnifier to cook.

It will be a big challenge if she try Bangladeshi clay stove..believe me it will look simple but it would be so hard to do
3  course meal with stove top cooker
You should use a pancake flat thingy
These are so fun and entertaining to watch! NEVER stop them. I have been liking them all.😋
I feel like covering everything in foil defeats the fun kitschy aspect of using hair tools. just put the steak on the straightener, its no fun with all this foil blocking the actual tool.
I LUV THIS DONT EVER STOP AND LIKE IF YOUR WATCHING THIS IN QUARITINE!
Would love to see you use donut or Cake pop maker, food processor or stick blender
the hair dryer looks exactly like mine
You should make 3 course meals using only 3 ingredients or maybe with a pizza maker
That sandwich looks sooo good ngl👀
Она так мило произносит слово блины

I HAVE A CHALLENGE.... make a whole 3 course meal with only a                       tea kettle lets see if you can do this.
I just realized that she  didn't vote how good the strawberries were
Tip with using a straighter :  You could use a rubber band to hold it together
It’s funny how Alexis is always surprised when she gets a weird appliance like she expects to get an oven/stove
If I tried doing this I wouldn’t use the appliance I would just make cereal for breakfast and sandwiches for lunch and dinner
use a lamp for your next video!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Use a lamp with a 250 or 300 watt bulb.
Can you use a small space heater.  You can make schwarma
Dish sterilizer maybe
I want to try blini now
Can you cook with 3 wick candle?
Dear tasty. This series is great and it was an amazing idea. But I think what makes tasty videos appealing at least for me is the character. The personality of the people and the less edited, more natural cooking. As well as the thought that, as outlandish as this particular video is, I may be able to cook this myself. I’d imagine I share this idea with others: this hyper-edited cutesy perfect scripted studio video is way less appealing. It looks nice and I’ll watch it, but it drives your production costs up. I feel like more Of a functional kitchen with appliances everywhere and functional tools around would be, simple put, much better. Take binging with babish for example: his kitchen has all his appliances, ovens, tools, stoves, all of it is there, and what isn’t there he shows, and it makes it feel more connected. In contrast, this video is clearly a purpose built studio with really nothing functional (I get the point of the series but still) around. Maybe if tasty had a few sets that were functional instead of purely visual it would make it look better. The editing as well is like a tv show. It feels super disconnected and not very YouTube. Like these people aren’t people, but actors reading a scrips off a teleprompter. I’m nowhere near a professional but I feel as though what I’ve said may have some insight. So yea, there’s that.
Hot glue gun
tea lights please. tea lit ceramic fondue set. lol
im one of the ppl who requested this! lmao im so happy right now.
I want to see her use a lighter
You definitely need a rematch with the toaster.
Please do a space heater!!
You pick up Alexis in a car and tell her you're going to arrive at the destination in three hours and that she needs to have lunch prepared By the time you arrive. She can sit in the backseat or the passenger seat and there would be a cooler of ingredients and maybe some battery operated appliances/electronics ? Chop chop :)
how about a candle?
Coming from a russian person, those arent actually called blini lol
Please try using a Jet Boil (which my kids use for camping). thanks!

Let's be real... The ones who carry Tasty are Rie, Alexis and Alvin. Period. Ps: For everyone mentioning Alix, she doesn't work for Tasty anymore, she usually just makes quick appearances on others' videos or Tasty uploads videos that she has already recorded before her departure.

Jesus saves! God gave His only Son to pay the price for our sins. We can never earn or work our way into heaven, but He took our sins and we only have righteousness through Him, so that we didn't justly go to hell! 2020 has definitely taught us that we're not in control and that times are changing, but God never changes and He will always be with those who seek Him and Jesus will take His elect to escape the coming tribulation (whenever that will be). Life's short, tomorrow's not promised, seek Him today!
Can This Chef Cook A 3-Course Meal With a Vaan de Graaaf generator?

Hubby says sandwiches I would eat strawberries.
a whisk is not a hair tool lol
What if you wrapped bacon around the curling iron so it cooks curled so then you have curled BACON

It is not "blini", actually, it's "oladyi". Blini are like crepes, they're thin and large. And oladyi are like little pancakes :) But you did great! P.S. We usually eat blini with jam (ru: varenye) or condensed milk (sguschenka)

Please Challange Alexis to use Direct Sunlight to make a dishes!!! so excited to see her
Is that her kitchen?????? It looks so prettyyy
She does better in the challenges where she uses non-cooking appliances then the challenges where she uses actual cooking appliances 😂😂😂
Maybe you could've wrapped the actual sandwiches with tin foil and then put them directly into the straightener so that they hold their shape a little bit more
I really want them to go into a desert and try to film and episode in it
Learn something new every day. 1. Blini for one, blinis for more than one. (Or it might even just be blini???) 2. The blinis I've been seeing on American cooking shows are not...accurate? They are actually more like crepes? Thanks people on YouTube

Slight mistake - those are NOT BLINI. The "little pancakes" are actually called Oladyi, and fit the exactl description and purpose of Alexis's dish. Blini are large, Crepe-like pancakes, thicker, yes, but quite large. The size of your usual pan bottom. So yeah! fun fact.
She needs to use a space heater or like a radiator!
PLEASE DO A WAX POT
These challenges always get crazier even when I think theres no way it could get crazier! Always so much fun to watch!

Hello 👋 The new video is super! 😜 Full view and Big Like from me!) Come to my channel, we will be friends🤗
there is a kitchen in the background
Seriously she can make chocolate dipped strawberries better than I can with a HAIR DRYER. I'm ashamed.
Make her cook with a chemistry set!
Why is the table they gave her so short?
she looks trashed
5:17 why does she look like a crazy person
Alright tasty.... The waffle iron had me pretty disappointed. Season 1-2 if she cooked an apt entree ir dessert, each meal required at least 2-3 different cooking requirements. Waffle iron, she made Japanese pancake and now chocolate covered strawberries! Wow!! You used to do beet dyed deviled eggs in the microwave. Now its melt chocolate!!! Step 2 dip strawberry. Done. What?!?!?! Come on! Please!!!!! 1-2nd season was amazing. I rewatch it.  1 step and done. No 👎 boo!! I cannot be alone here on this disappointment!!
alexis making gourmet things with a hairdryer meanwhile i make less gourmet  things with normal cookware
Should she do dry ice but for food
The beginning of the video: do not try this at home Alexis at the end: let me know if you try this at home!  No hate. I love her!
I would really like to try the steak sandwiches, im a really big fan of steak its my favorite
seems like a sabotage on “cutthroat kitchen”
You can see the crazy in her eyes during the sandwich making
400 degrees! That does explain how girls literally burn their hair off hahahahaha 😂 😂 😂
Pls do a vid with light bulbs
She acts like Tori Vega from victorious

Wowww that's crazy
She got a free toaster and hair tools why would she want to stop the series
Someday, tasty will stress her out with 'sunlight'
Can this chef cook a 3-course meal with e mini-refrigerator?
it's very satisfying and strange to hear a hair tool sizzle food in such a way. I'd like to see a chef try to make a full course meal using one of those itty bitty tiny real kitchens OR a hotdog cooker, yes those do exist.
I have a suggestion "can this chef cook a 3-course meal with a electric whisk? " to finally give her what she wants.
KETTLE PLEASE!!!
Try using a candle, it might work actually
I wanna be the guest someday , just so I could eat anything she makes.
Can this chef make a 3-course meal with a popcorn machine? Or, Can this chef make a 3-course meal without any cooking utensils.

She's never been this happy and confident on this show for so long after that microwave.

Let's be real... The ones who carry Tasty are Rie, Alexis and Alvin. Period. Ps: For everyone mentioning Alix, she doesn't work for Tasty anymore, she usually just makes quick appearances on others' videos or Tasty uploads videos that she has already recorded before her departure.

I just realized that she sounds like Emily Blunt in an American accent
Hi 👋
Anyone else think the quality/effort of her dishes has gone down like melting chocolate for a dessert and using the tools for literally one component of a tiny dish is not it
They’re cheating spoons, spatulas and knives are tools
Or how about an episode of cooking only with a sous vide
Can we do an episode of cooking with things that people who live in a van cook with?
I love this series! Just wanted to show my love🙃
ALEXIS MAKES THIS SHOW! Such a sweetheart!

Make a meal out of a toaster oven
Hey, have you guys ever watched any of Heston Blumenthal’s TV episodes (especially the “feast” ones)? I’ve watched them all on numerous occasions & not only is it very creative for chefs eager to learn something new, but it’s so daring that one can’t help but watch in awe at all of the tasty & bizarre creations! If you haven’t seen it, I totally recommend you do. It will legit blow your mind! 😄❤️ 🖥
You should try to cook a three course meal with those hot steak stones.
Y’all should do a steak/lava stone!

The absolute strangest blini I’ve ever seen in my life. They aren’t supposed to be that small. No clue where she got that from. Lol but that’s fine. You made little pancakes, let’s call it what it is.
She literally nailed this one, totally did not expect that! Glad there's some success after last time wasn't too amazing haha

one day she will probably forget that she cooked meat in a hair straightner , then wonder why does her hair smell like meat
Gas burner/stove
Can a chef make a 3 course meal with science lab materials like Bunsen burners, hot plates, beakers, test tubes? Pls, I really want to see this.
Hot stones
Eh, it's more like "bliny", and that's already in the plural. And what she made or what she showed is in no way close to bliny cuz' bliny is literally crepes. Wide and thin. What she made, idk, "oladushki"? A little closer to pancakes but not really pancakes. Do the research, lmao :)
She does fine with the unorthodox tools but is honestly pretty bad at the regular ones like toaster or rice cooker. Like????
You could've laid that hairdryer against the metal cookies sheet next to the bowl, and it would've gotten hot enough to melt that chocolate. I've witnessed MANY burns fr hair dryers. Lol
IS ANYONE EVER HAVE SOLAR COOKER, LIKE??
nice job. I love it so much
If they gave me hair tools i would make just sashimi cause all you gotta do is cut the raw fish and serve it with soy sauce,wasabi,and ginger lol😂
She is so smart,creative and beautiful!🥰 (Btw Those strawberries look soTASTY!!!🤤🍓🍫)

Give her a stove but she can't use pots or pans, only almuminium foil.
Blini usually much bigger and thinner than the pancakes, what she did is mini pancakes
Use a candle
I would have loved to see her use a hair crimper so that she can get grill lines on the bread and steak
how about candles? or match sticks😊😊😊
Alexis is so cool. Alright Im gonna go make my instant noodles
I want to eat ALL THE DELICIOUS FOOD. It all sounds and looks fantastic (although blue cheese, ick). I am now more curious about the blender-prepared vegan food, because that looked like it tasted pretty fantastic....

Is it a coincidence that the day she's cooking with hair tools is the day Alexis looks so hot and stressed by the end that she needs a hair touch-up? Looks like it was hard work today but the result is so worth it, well done!

"My confidence level favour wise 10. My confidence level aesthetically a 1."

small surface areas are perfect for fancy restaurants since the serving cant even feed a baby
Could you do a solar oven next?
Vertical meat grill or popcorn maker perhaps?
i cant' stop thinking about the energy consumption...
How about science lab equipment
My school chromebook really said that this is "inappropriate." IT'S A COOKING VIDEO! How is this inappropriate?
I’m going to make those steak sandwiches
Alexis is seriously the best! Such a great personality and talent, we need Alllll the Alexis content, please ♥️
I love this series however I think it's time for plot-twists for example give her the tool she may use but the plot twist would be she would have to make 3 specific meals OR she would get some specific key-ingredients that she HAS to use (she can add whatever she wants to them) this is one of my fav series tho!
Fondue maker!
Has she done an easy bake oven yet? Also I vote magnifying glass, sous vide, heat lamp, aaaand ok that’s all I can think of lol
Hairstylist be like : ok list everything she is saying
I wonder if a Cubano sandwich could’ve been made with the hair straightener instead? Or a different panini?
Omg yes i love these ✨❤️
Can a chef make meal with a candle? (impossible)
The steak sandwiches looked like they'd taste so good!
Steam cleaners
I love watching this series!!
I can not explain even to myself why this made me so uncomfortable
Need a part 2... better version.... You can go more risky than that...
I think next episode you should try using a washer or a dryer
Please do can this chef make a 3 course meal with a candle (This was somebody else’s idea)
This is fake she knew that it will be hair equipment   Just look at how awesome her hair is
Can this chef cook a 3 course meal with lava?
nobody: closed captions: "hair strainer"
I’ve seen a girl on TikTok cook food with a scentsy wax melter. I want to see her try
You should try to cook a meal with an autoclave or medical devices.
Jesus is LORD
she could serve me the sandwich in the restaurant and I'd wonder who'd pay for it, it's looks mad luxurious and expensive-
I use my flat iron to cook things 😻
Blowtorch
I love this show!
маленькие блины? что. оладушки, но не блины.

3 meal course with a panini press
You should do a laundry machine next
When she said that the hairdryer could be 100 degrees I was like "what the hell?" Then I remembered that she was probably using Fahrenheit not Celsius
When u realize that the intro song comes from the smart food popcorn add.💀💀
I love when she calls us internet ☺️😊😊😊
I think she should do a popcorn maker next!
I’m thinking she should try cooking with a chafing dish set next. You can’t really control the temperature with it and I’be seen stuff that’s supposed to be just warmed get cooked instead due to the intensity of the burner.
3 meals over a campfire
I love how toasters are the most useless appliances in existence.

Please do a collaboration with Ms. Yeah who does things like you are doing, Alexis.
I think there was a show a few years back where they had these insane cooking challenges.  Anyways,  i think she should try to cook on top of the hood of a car (with engine running). Kinda makes sense,  since the hood can get pretty hot after awhile.
Fondue thingy next???
I wanna taste test on this
My fav one from chef out of water
She is always confused. Lol. Maybe because of how she has to cook
Next up with a Dutch ‘Poffertjespan’ !! 🇳🇱

Alexis with long hair ❤️❤️
I think she could have done whipped cream with that massager kinda thing
SHE SHOULD DO Toaster
you should use only sun to make 3 course meal🤣
Um... 3 course meal in a homemade solar oven?
Can you use a candle 🕯 next?
Russian blinis is not so small!! blini is large and thin, sometimes with little holes. but oladis is small and thick. so it's oladis 🤷
Can we be getting how long it takes her to do things?
I hope once its summer again, Alexis could make the meals using just the sun 🤓
I hope once its summer again, Alexis could make the meals using just the sun 🤓
What about using a heat lamp and or  a flashlight!!
When you said “blinis” I immediately wanted to shout “ it is blini and not blinis and you said it again. You say blì-nì
can you use ice-cream maker machine!!!!!?
if you used bacon you could of curled it around like hair
how about trying a blast furnace or welding tools
I miss the guest judge
I mean, if 2 goofballs can make a healthy wholesome breakfast using SEX TOYS, then using heat generating hair tools should be much easier.
I would have done something with bacon, made around the curling iron so that it would be like a curly bacon
Can this chef cook a 3 course meal with an IMMERSION BLENDER!

Can This Chef Cook a 3-Course Meal with Heat Radiating off the Back Of The Fridge?
I really love this series
you missed the opportunity to put rie's face instead of a top hat when alexis said 'fancy' hahahaha
As a Russian I need to say this lol. So blinis (which are actually bliny with the stress on the last syllable) are like French crepes, thye're large and thin. The pancake-like things are oladushki :) And we don't eat them with caviar just when we wanna get FaNcY but we usually eat them like this for breakfast
Can this chef make a 3- course meal on a hot plate? Can this chef make a 3- course meal in an egg cooker? Can this chef make a 3- course meal in a crock pot? Can this chef make a 3- course meal with a bunsen burner?

Cook on “ELECTRIC KETTLE/WATER BOILER” pleasee! ❤️❤️
Did anyone else notice that she acted surprised when she opened the box but she’s the only person in her apartment/house😂? She did great though😂
next she should cook with a hot processor of a laptop overheating or with just a candle
Electric kettle?
She is the "macgyver" in the kitchen👏🏻👏🏻❤❤
I hope this series continues, because this is amazing and very fun to watch. I mean cooking with a curling iron and hair straightener??! 💖💖💖
i like this series. it's like the classic mcgyver but at the kitchen.
Do you remember those old laptop chargers that can get seriously hot?  Plss tasty make this happen💕
y'all havent tried one with a steamer!
Finally! We have been requesting this for a long time. Make her cook with sunlight!
I always appreciated how she rated her own dishes without biases on it.
Man! Chef’s so cute
Stress level can be measured by seeing Alexis' hairstyle changes as the video progress 🤣
This series is best ever.... Love it
If you seek you will find, what you find is what you have projected. To find that one thing there must be freedom from all attachment, the one thing is compassion, it is the one answer that is true under all circumstances and therefore, out of that right action.
Blini is not always small some variation are like crepe
The way Alexis is excited about the hair straightener heating up to 450 degrees 😂
Imagine having her as a roommate
and here i am with a complete cooking tools yet cant even cook nearly as good as alexis🙃
Rice cooker?
Can This Chef Cook A 3-Course Meal With Hot Stone? • Tasty
This is hands down the best YouTube series ever. Alexis is an extremely talented chef! Hats off! 💯💯💯💯
As funny as it is to watch her flounder, she actually seems like a really amazing chef, and I would love to see her do a legit cooking show. She is super knowledgeable, and her recipes seem very creative.
Can Alexis make a 3 course meal using mini electric tandoor😂?
i love this series sooooo much. PLs never stop
Petition to change to series title to can ALEXIS instead of can this chef.
Gae
next challenge candle pleasee
Try a panini press!!
Am I the only one who wonders why she never sits and eats?
A steamer pleasss
Can the chef make a e course meal with a room heater
I think it'd be really interesting to see if she could cook with just a cast iron salamander, like the kind you use to brown the tops of already cooked dishes
lol she always does great with strange equipment than she does with things meant for cooking, I mean remember microwave and toaster??
The next episode should be either lab stuff like a burner and beaker... or a double boiler
THIS IS SO CREATIVE OMGGGGGGG
I want to eat all of them!!
She should try cooking by using lab apparatus tools next episodes. Whose with me? 🙋🏻‍♂️
THE SUN
Do a three course meal with a flamethrower lol 😂
I’m not sure is it done already but you should try cooking using a really basic rice cooker! Those with only one button
She could have wrapped bacon round the curling wand, and that twisty funnel bread maybe
Do sandwich maker and bread maker next!!!!!
I wish i could work in tasty. 🥺🥺
Can u make a 3-course meal with lights(n)
Like  😍😍😍😍watch duck soup Noor
Blinis aren't actually supposed to be small, they're usually really flat, thin and pretty wide, like the size of a normal pan! You also eat them with jam, sweetened condensed milk or meat, vegetables, or with the things that were shown in the video :)
How about... a cloth drier? Is that how you spell it? Yeah, but that machine 😂  edit : is it dryer? what, how to spell. too lazy to search
She should try using science lab equipment
HOW ABOUT A SANDWITCH MAKER
This was absolutely insane in the best way possible.
HOW ABOUT A FACE STEAMER !!!
use the sun :)
Toasting the bread before assembling would’ve probably given the better aesthetic.
Does it annoy anyone else when she pronounced aesthetically aestitically?
My comment came true ❤️
Please make a three-course meal using only one hand!!
Can thos chef make 3 course meal with kettle
i wonder if i can every cook with that
I want to have steak sandwhich
A TOASTER AGAIN!!!
I’m Russian and blinis aren’t small at all usually... it’s the opposite  However Oladyi are always small
Make a 3 course  meal with a steamed plsssssssss. Like u have made the dishes with like every possible appliance available u r gr8🤗🤗
A cup of hot water
My friend: *straightening her hair* Me: Hurry up give me that i need to cook breakfast😂
Tasty- I need some chef out water merch stat
3-coarse meal with gardening tools and a sun lamp
YouTube is getting too comfortable with unskipable ads
Next heater
LOL this was not what we call blinis in Russia 😂 They're big and thin, more like what you guys know as French crepes. And in a normal Russian family you wouldn't see smoked salmon on blinis unless it's a big holiday 😅 These tiny ones Alexis cooked are more like what we call "oladi". I don't mind the whole confusion of the names tho, just thought I'd give you guys an idea of what an actual Russian person knows about this 😂 Alexis did so great in this video and I'm really happy to see her enjoying the results! ❤️
Candles or the sun next
Oh great one of them bet all that food had some bits of hair
Prpeeeppepepepepwpepwppwpwpwpwpwpwpwpwpwpwpwppeppepwpwpepewwp
Cook in science lab equipment
Idk what russian has already mentioned this but, although tasty, those are not bliny. You can call those "oladushki" maybe but bliny are thin and large and similar to crêpes!
She's lying.
It is not "blini", actually, it's "oladyi". Blini are like crepes, they're thin and large. And oladyi are like little pancakes :) But you did great! P.S. We usually eat blini with jam (ru: varenye) or condensed milk (sguschenka)
She should work with the sun next!!!! Cooking a three course meal using sun's heat!
Love you Alexis..im a fan your skill and mainly your expressions..you are so cute😊
Blini aren’t small they’re exactly like crepes. The ones that are like small pancakes are called oladyi and it is a sweet dish, no one eats it with salmon or caviar unlike blini. Why Americans can never get Russian food right? First you put T at the end of borsch, now this...
Alexis is the bestest!!!
this whole show is just “they’re gonna know😳” “nobody’s gonna know 🤫” “they’re gonna know 🤔” “how would they know?🥰”
Yes. This looks exactly like student life with me and my friends 😂
Hello

The evolution of Alexis's hair is great. She's one of my favourite chefs.
So is this now considered flatbread?
Maybe an unpopular opinion but I kinda miss when tasty made simple recipe videos where there was no talking and just music and instructions 😕

Am i the only person thinking..she looks like finding dory?
please do a popcorn machine
I am waiting for her to make 3 course meal with magnifying glass.
Alexis :"i have had nightmares about this" Alexis: aces the whole thing with zero mess ups and breakdowns
I’m very confused about the working relationship between Buzzfeed/Tasty and Alexis. I was under the impression she left without the option of freelancing/contract content creation and all the videos we were getting were stuff created and back logged. But the current set up with regard to the plague makes it seem like she either was rehired or she’s doing contract/freelance content creation for them . Either way I’m glad we are still getting content from her because she is the literal best.
can this chef cook a  3 course meal with candles?
Just throwing out ideas for future videos: space heater, pressure cooker, popcorn machine, tea kettle, slow cooker, steam gun???
💗💗
What if she used a pressure cooker? Like, ONLY a pressure cooker. I want to see that.
The most ironic thing was the advertisement for this was of Morphy Richards kitchen appliances
I challenge you to make food using a vaccum
Electric Kettle
Wow this was the best one! She topped the toaster one! :D
Why? I have pots and pans !!! Dummy

Really liked the old format better with the guests commentary and appliance guessing. It feels more like an actual challenge that way, cos now it feels like a come-along-on-my--weird-journey tutorial.
I'd eat all of them... honestly.
CONGRATULATIONS!! BRAVO YOU ARE INVITED TO COOK THIS THANKSGIVING 👍👍🙃🙃🤙🤙🤙

Since we've already left the strictly cooking appliance section... How about cooking with a PS4? Lol or a PS2 I remember steaks on PS2s were a thing circa Youtube 2008  But prolly not a lot of versatility there aside from just heating.

Full meal with a molcajete!
On the next episode use a  flame torch
Try making food with a car
Alexis: "I'm gonna be making my sandwich with steak, grilled onions, and bleu cheese-- a pretty classic combination." Me: "I'm gonna be making my sandwich with... cheese. And uh, bread. A pretty classic combination."
As someone actually russian, I've never seen blini small
Omg!! Alexis is so talented, so proud of her - I'd love to have those sandwiches for sure 👏🏼
what about with no heat? or nothing?
Yasssss!! Finally! Ive been waiting for this!!
Please don't stop this series. Im like waiting and checking everyday if there's a new uploaddd.
can u cook with heater next?? :o
I think this is the most interesting one by far but I’m surprised she didn’t just pop popcorn as an appetizer 😂
I'd marry her anyday. Just saying. That kind of intellect and determination is what I want in the mother of my children.
I want to see her cook on one of thos flat light desk lamp I once melted a fruit snack on one that's how hot thy can get
They should do a crossover when its safe with make it fancy.   So make it fancy with household tools. So they need to make instant Ramen fancy using a blender
Would be cool if Gordon Ramsay popped out of nowhere in the show
Imagine if these challenges had a time limit...
Level of creativity of this show mygod! Alexis carrying entire Tasty on her back 💕
Am I the only stoner that been known you could use a flat iron like that ...?😂iykyk
Guys i think I have an idea of what she can make next. Can she make a three course meal with a kettle 0.o also I think maybe with a mixer because she always wanted one and see if she can make something else than just something for baking like cupcakes and cakes. Also this is another idea but can she make like a washing mashing and a dryer machine I mean a dryer machine has heat in it and she can use a washing for I guess mixing like a blender
YAYYYYYYY I LOVE THOS
You would never EVER thought that hair tools was the best out of all the tools she used
Can she use a hand mixer
This is my favorite series! I look forward to it every weekend!
Girl u know this food nasty stop lying sis I don’t Believe it
ok but she can probably cook with just a pair of scissors and some heat at this point-
lol.  I clicked because of that cartoon face she made for the thumbnail.
now im craving a steak, onion and blue cheese sandwich...
I love how i get a hair ad before this video plays
Why can’t she taste it?
Using a KEURIG COFFEE MAKER!!!
Great job!  I could almost smell that sandwich!
"Russian blini" are you sure about that... even in fancy restaurants they don't make them that small, blini are big and thin, almost lacey(just like crepes). also buckwheat flour isn't common at all, what you've made looks more like oladyi
Can u make a three course meal with a portable heater.
Try a blow torch or a oil heater
ok I might be pushing it but how about 'can this chef make a 3-course meal with a steam cleaner'
I love her long hair ❤
Peace, can I ask you to support this channel that provides recipes  Aalam khadija kiriwt
I got an idea what she can use next      The sun!!!
We were joking at work about cooking sous vide in the dish washer, please make it happen!!!✌✌😁 The hair dryer is the ideal  tool to dry macaron tops before putting them in the oven, it cuts the waiting time to half or less, that's how I do it😀
Alexis: I had Nightmare at this moment also Alexis: My death wish has come
MY KITCHEN: hair dryer,hair straighteners, easyback oven, campfire, blow torch, tools,
Can she make a 3 course meal with a wax warmer. Like a Sentsy warmer!!!!! That would be sooo cool
Loved the decor on the strawberry   Next week you should try The Rollie Egg Cooker and see if you can do something other then just eggs
Can this chef cook a 3 course meal with a kettle

Honestly I’d wanna try the sandwiches 😂
How was this the easiest episode she’s done
Make a meal with candles.
She’s making a 3 course meal with hair tools and I’m making a 3 minute mess with the stove Edit: I feel like she’s going crazy during this round 😂
Idk this seemed less ambitious than her other foods. And also tiny
I would totally eat the steak 😋an strawberry
She should try using only a kettle
What happened to the  guest taste testers? It's better for someone else to judge instead of the actual chef..........
I have been waiting for this
This video:exists  Youtube ads: Hair straightener ads
How about cook with a candle
Good job, Alexis!
Can you do a 3 course meal with laboratory items?
*we've been waiting for this moment since the beginning, guys*
I'm rewatching these when the apocalypse hits. I'll be making hair-tool food in my garbage hut pretending the world hasn't ended.
I love your content!! I am already subscribed! Congratulations! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 You are invited to know my channel! I hope you like it!
BUT WHAT DID SHE RATE THE STRAWBERRIES?
you should have this chef use something that doesn’t require electricity! A lot of people go without it on this earth and it could also be a learning experience for her and others!!
As a Russian myself I was shocked about “blini is usually small” NO! NO NO NO blini is actually really big and slim, almost looks like lace....
May i suggest a pressure cooker?😀
These videos are perfect for the “just moved out of home and I’ve got no kitchen utensils student” ,now I know whether I’ve got power tools or my hairdryer I’ll never go hungry
This is probably my favourite show out of all the other ones on tasty
Alexis is the BEST !!!
Try cooking with a mini donut maker, or a  portable heater.
Make here cook with air
this just reminds me why I've limited my use of these tools on my hair lol SO much heat!! But now I can repurpose them in my kitchen I guess :)

Alexis: Stoves are for the weak.
I love these out of the box ideas in this cooking show. Never ending recipes
Halogen Air Fryer! or the tabletop Pizza oven! I also agree with the candle comments. Or when it gets hot again the inside of a car? (could even do a PSA for not leaving people in hot cars) Smokeless BBQ?
I wanna eat all of them
TEA KETTLE NEXT!!
dishwasher!
Sandwich ....I wanna try that sandwich... 🤤
After all the experience, she can literally cook with anything

5:38 the one thing i was scared of happened. Hope your fingers are better
How about a tea kettle??
The moment she said hair tools i thought popcorn lol
I wish someone could've guessed what she was cooking with. This would've been awesome to see a guest react
Can this chef make a 3 course  meal  with  candles
How about a lamp???
Use a heater! Or the sun

When you spent all your money on makeup and clothes and forget to by a microwave and stove and pans you use your hair tools
Next time can you use wax machine 😂
Good to know that i can start a restaurant... in a washroom :)))))
USE A VACUUM CLEANER
Yay tasty Hair products!!!! If anyone can do it, we know she can!! Well as long as the salt near-by 😅🤣😂
"a hairdryer I cant imagine gets very hot" She's never gotten a blowout from the Dominican salons. That heat could boil water.
I always feel like this is so scripted. Very artificial like love the content but feels weird
She keeps asking for a hand mixer so... Let her cook a 3 course meal with a hand mixer.
Try to cook a three course meal with only a dishwasher
Alexis you should try to make a 3 corse meal with laboratory items
She should use a sink

Next time on chef out of water:  Cooking a full course meal only using the sun
you can make good food with hair things but not a toaster haha
You should try sometime to make a meal with laboratory equipment.   (Like; Balance, pipet, beakers, burners, erlenmeyer flask, funnel, tubes, mortar and pestle)
Bro I think that looks lit
I wonder if you could grill or something if you lined up like 6-8 curling irons. The bumps would be like a panini press
We need a crockpot episode, please!
Finally!
3-course meal using crock pot
Why does she look like the female James Charles
How come she can make a 3 course meal with hair tools and I can’t make anything with regular tools in a kitchen?
not sure the hype about the chocolate covered strawberries... all you gotta do is heat and melt the chocolate
Next one should be either a pancake griddle or popcorn machine
MAKE A 3 COURSE MEAL USING TESTUBES, BEAKERS, FLASKS AND A BUNSEN BURNER!!!!! WITH SAFETY GLASSES AND GLOVES!!!
I have been waiting for this episode since the beginning!! You are so talented! Your hard work that you put into every single video is so much appreciated! It makes my day better everytime I see there was a video posted with you! Keep up the good work !❤️❤️❤️❤️
OMG A CHEMISTRY SET, TESTUBES AND A BUNSEN BURNER!!!

Can you do a blender but only use the smoothie mode
Guys if you give her a little bit of heat it's not fun anymore DON'T AMUSE HER WITH HEAT!! and refridgerator IS A KITCHEN TOOL!!!!  Don't let her use it!
Ahh now it makes sense....that’s why those kadoodles things cost so much
Can this chef make 3-coures meal using candle
She should try to use a George Foreman
Someone needs to give a medal to this chef, who can literally cook with any appliance she gets!
How about a rematch with the power tools
You remind me of Alexis Rose❤️
how does she do this. her dishes are always so presentable and well executed
Loved everything but the strawberries thought there would a more adventurous desert
My Sister: "Where is my hair straightener?"  Me: "I used it to cook bacon."  My sister: "Why would you do that?!? You should be using my curling iron."
P.s. I adore you. 🥰
Then Alexis does it everything looks so easy! But this one was actually easy
CANDLES NEXT
Fun!
You should do a "Can this chef cook a 3-course meal with a deep fryer"
I love this show but as a Russian blinis are thin and crepe-like not small and thick pancake things
Oh my god I was literally worried today that I had binge watched all the episodes to this series 😭💜 ALEXIS IS A GEMMM
Yay!
Best tasty series!!! Love these episodes great vid🥰
Why not try gardening tools??
A Bunsen burner?
Try with a bread maker next time!
This madness has got to stop next thing u know my gf gonna start cooking dinner in the bedroom
Do a battery!!!
Best chef at tasty. Period.
A little bit Alexis
I would probably hate the sandwich because I hate  blue cheese, but it all looked amazing
I live for these videos. Every time there’s a new upload my heart is so happy.
This should be called "mini dishes made with hair tools"
I WANT TO BE HER TASTE TESTERRR 😭😍😍😍
You should make her cook the same meals with conventional kitchen tools and see how they compare
I kinda wanna see her use a power drill
How many of you love this show like this cmmt❤️
Honestly Alexis makes this series.
Yasss Alexis!!!!
Next thing to cook with, a washing mashing and dryer

Stove without pots and pans!
Now if only she got scissors instead of a knife
I’ve been having a pretty bad day, tons of anxiety, and then I see an Alexis video!!! Thank goodness this is just what I needed
Throughout the series alexis has come up with different methods to melt chocolate
As a Russian, I can say it's 100 percent not blinis.
lack of inspiration in the 3 dishes... SAD
Can this chef make a 3 course meal with a popcorn maker
You should do toastie makers
Do a kettle next!!
Can this chef make a three course meal with a fondue pot
I'm so happy this is back. This woman lightens my mood up every single time.
Leave it to Alexis to finesse a full course meal with hair tools while I burn my fingers with them 😅
If I go on a date and he say he can't cook........it's over. She set the bar too high😁😁
The title should be "Can this device be repurposed?"    Short answer:  Yes
straighter its ready put some olive oil. me: 👁👄👁
Tasty's subscribers will be gone if they stop these series.
i love these so much
Next a panini press or a crepe maker!!
9:58 they're going to know How would they know(same chaotic energy)  lol
I feel like I just watched a new one and I want more!!!
Hey guys never stop making these I love them! also try to make one with a blow torch
What happened to having other people taste it so we can get there honest opinion. And they guess. That was part of the best part for me. They can taste it and still social distance. 😊
What she was made are not blini, these are oladyi. Blini usually have a size like a crêpes and oladyi are more like american pancakes (in size). Blini can be eaten not only with fish or caviar, it's actually very fancy way to eat them, I should say :D They usually served like that on the special occasions as New Year or B-day. For the rest of the year we eat them with jams, sour cream or sweetened condensed milk. And the recepie that she used...ughh, that's just wrong. Really wrong. Nor blini or oladyi have butter in them and blini (the real ones, not that in the video) don't need any baking powder. Nope nope nope
It’s funny because  I have a older sister but she just orders door dash well I actually try to make food
'Can this chef make a 3-course meal with an egg boiler'???❤
I love this series😍😍 Cheers to you Alexis!!❤
Great job Alexis
chemistry lab set next plzzz
Spoiler alert: she probably can
Bread maker! When are we going to see a bread maker?
WTF that doesn't called "blinis" (blini - is a little bit thicker soft crepe (I mean - liquid butter on large pan etc), while these were "oladushki")  We definitely have some mistakes in translations in both ways so...)
3 course meal cooked with acid
Use a candle lighter!!!! :)
I've been waiting for this one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
When she started saying 140° I was like, WHAT?! 😳😳  Then I remembered my country uses Celsius and the US doesn't 😅😅
Smoothie mixer?
Maybe someday her face will finally freeze in this expression we've seen in EVERY preview... How a person can grimace so much? It's not funny anymore.
Who else gets happy watching Alexis eating? 😋 she’s the best !!
Stop giving college kids   ✨ I D E A S ✨
Hey can you use laboratory items to make a 3 course meal?
Mornings before class: put foil on straightener, make sandwich, remove foil, straighten hair, slay the day!

Still wish they did the reveal and have someone else taste test.
USE A DISHWASHER TO COOK A MEAL!!
All these videos have the same comments on top xD
I'VE WATCHED EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE PLZ KEEP MAKING MORE
Bunsen burner?
Entertaining; but, completely unrealistic
You could do a vintage challenge - like using a Victorian/pre-Victorian kitchen
As a Russian used to huge af blini (like the size of a regular pan) watching her doing this itty-bitty pancakes is so funny.
What about a 3 course meal with a pressure cooker?😊
Can she make a 3 course meal via a Bunsen Burner? Something Sciency for once.
How many lightbulbs does it take a chef to create a 3-course meal?
Oh my gosh! I have like the biggest crush on Alexis 😍 so cute

Alexis: I going to put this in the refrigerator and move on to the next coarse Me: Isn’t a refrigerator an appliance
You should do 3 course meal with an easy bake oven
Now please cook on a CPU
I want to make all of them... with the hair tools too... looked too fun not too ahaha
I know we are going through a pandemic but i really miss having someone else taste testing 😕
Tasty-- like you don't understand how excited I get when I see Alexis on my recommended. NEVER END THIS SERIES IT IS THE SOURCE OF JOY FOR SO MANY OF US
Will you guys go back to normal quick recipes once quarantine is over? because these are awful.

alexis, ik it's cringe, but... i love you <3
Prepare 3 course meal using my Toshiba laptop.
Hi tasty, can you challenge Alexis to make a meal/dish with a radiator.
The bread just ruined the sandwiches, if she used a small square of dark bread (a bit sweet almost) and a crispy crust it would have been perfect
WAITT SHE CAN USE THE SUN HEATT LIKE COOK USING THE SUNNN
Why is it just Alexa, no hate she’s the best but like, who else can do this series???
JUST A FRIDGE??
I like how we keep the tradition of Alexis being better with appliances that are not suposed to be for cooking  😅
Melting chocolate isn't really making anything smh.
LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SERIES! Please keep it going! Also next idea: The Sun! ☀️😂
Hi

Can the chef make a three course meal using a car engine?
Still waiting on a steam iron. You anaze me
Try a Fondue pot
Just give her the stove next time and let her do her magic. 🤣
It´s a pity she turned into a robot =/
You've got "blinis" so wrong... they're like crepes. What Alexis made is entirely different thing
Make a 3 course meal with a air popcorn maker thing
That is NOT blini. Blini are crepe sized. And thin.
I love this show
Get this poor woman a taller table!
Emm.. that's not blini, that's oladyi, russian pancakes, blini is similar to crepes (I'm russian,so I know it))))

Sometimes I feel really bad for what they throw at her and this is one of those times lol
I love this series...plz invite guests to taste this awesome foods
Alexis should try to cook with a Massager, then can mix (kinda) and heat
Amazing !!
Me use going to be a broke college student in under two years: *I better take some notes*

FINALLY
It is not “blini”, it is “oladushky”
the main course
Give this woman only a handmixer please xD
Holly molly, I'm gonna write those recipes down...fantastic
I don't think this was creative/complex enough, Alexis.  I'd like to see a redo on these tools. Other ideas for cooking tools-clothing steamer, Popcorn air popper, immersion blender, coffee frother, milk steamer, baby bottle warmer.
Can she with a light bulb?
please never stop this series😂🤍
It would be so funny if she used a French press or a salad spinner 😂
Can this chef make a three-course meal with a fondue maker.   Like if you think would be interesting 👇  Edit Thanks for all the likes guys
Her ❤️❤️
Cook 3 course meal with only hand mixer. 😂
Blini are not small actually. We make them the size of the pan
Go outdoor, use solar cooker
How about making food in acoffee maker?
ive commented hair dryer on almost every video yet my comment wasn't in the video 😑
Instant pot!
maybe if she covered the sandwich in foil it would have been more even?? tho the thing that got me the most was how is Ma'am Alexis just up and touching hot hair tools with hands?? the power??
if a hair straightener can cook some beef... must be really dangerous for head
Office supplies (drip coffee maker, scissors, paper trimmer, paper shredder, etc)
This is really good series
When Alexis was talking about the temperatures I thought that she was talking about it in celsius and then when she said it could get up to 450 degrees i was like 👁👄👁
A hand mixer
We all knew this was coming 😂
LMAO making 3 course meals w/ hair tools I never thought this day would come
Try a hand mixer
oh my gosh lab apparatus (like conical flasks, measuring cylinders, Bunsen burners, etc.)
try cooking using a water heater
I have a post-Halloween food hangover and yet watching this I have the urge to take a bite out of everything Alexis made.
5 minute crafts are going to have soo many ideas with this
Can she use heat from a candle to cook?
3 Course meal with electrical kettle pls!!!!!!!!

Love this series.
Oh great job alexis

Oooo finally finally finalllyyy.. God has finally heard our wishes

Can I just say Alexis' Kitchen is so aesthetically pleasing.
I always wonder how Alexis doesn't burn all of her fingers off in every episode
I loveeee this series
Sometimes in the future:  Can this chef cook a 3-courses meal with a pencil sharpener ?
Okay I'm convinced Alexis is a sorceress
This woman can make better food with a hair straightner than I can with a full kitchen
Plot twist: *Everything was used before they gave it to her*   5 years later: Hey doc! I think that I have stomach problems.    Doc: Hmm let me check. Oh wow its tangled    Alexis: MY STOMACH?!    Doc: No I mean the hair. I never knew you ate your hair.    Alexis: I-
How is she a million times better with hair tools than she was with an air fryer or a microwave? I think we should all be using a curling iron to cook! lol
Finally they listened to my idea!!
Why dnt you try cooking on solar cooker
Since she desires fire, have her try with a creme brulee torch.  Either the little handheld one or the one that uses a foot long butane tank.
She should do a radiator next ✌️
I've never seen blini this small sized. And I live here. Always thought blini its just russian crapes. But not always rolled and more bubbly(there are small holes from bubbles in the ultimate round sheets) 😳
She makes me think of Petra in Jane the Virgin... Is it just me ?
And I thought the toaster was extreme..
She always complains for a beater so you should give her a beater to make 3 course meal
As someone who keeps reptiles, I definitely think you could cook with heat mats and lamps meant for reptiles 😂 give it a try, but make sure to chose the right watts you could find one as low as 15 watts to 150 watts.
Whenever Alexis says "Oh no", always reminds me of the time she had put salt instead of sugar🤣. Btw tasty, please never stop this series.
I have that same dryer😄
Have u ever burned yourself with a blow dryer? Its not fun
Can she cook with a washing machine
3-Course Meal with a stand mixer.

As soon as I saw the word "blinis" I knew I was in for a disappointment. And boy was I right when she started "explaining" what they "are".
Yay she made a comeback from last week!!
Make a 3 course meal with a overheating pc😂
PETITION - PLEASE CHANGE THE TITLE FROM “Can this chef make a 3 course meal with a “ to “How will Alexis make a 3 course meal with a ...” because honestly she deserves the Recognition for being such an extraordinary chef . Also How about Science lab equipment next ?
I know this will sound terrible, and I'm so sorry Alexis... But I enjoy it more when she struggles lol
make a 3 course meal with lab equipment
I’m convinced Alexis can handle anything we throw at her now
Make a hree corse meal with sloe cooker
*hair* . *tools* .
If y'all ever go back to power tools again then I'd love to see your chef try using larger tools. Like mixing things in a cement mixer, cutting things with a chainsaw, etc.  Either way, I think this show is awesome!
Alexis is like the bear grylls of "culinary world"!
Tasty you better treat her right! She is hand down absolutely amazing and talented ♥️
Somebody’s going to get excited, try this mes at home and regret it. Smh
Of course I get a hair ad
I made a steak & blue cheese with grilled onion panini when my folks got the 1st generation George Foreman grill, back in the day.  It was amazing!  I used sourdough slices, which was the only difference.
How about a facial steamer for the next challenge?
can this chef cook a 3-course meal with an overheating MacBook
She never disappoints 😌... amazing series
"‘Can this chef make a 3- course meal with a candle.’🕯🕯" not my idea but copy once to make it happen.
Sous Vid without water next, please.
It would have been interesting to see her use the curling iron to make a cannoli. I love this series! 🥰
broke college students been writing notes down on this series.
please make something with water heater/kettle. I've had seen this kinda show in masterchef, they make something with microwave and sandwich toaster but they didn't use the water heater/kettle. just wonder what kind of food can make in water heater/kettle except instant noodles
Reccomendation : Food processor
Isn't it a bit ... concerning that the hair straightener goes up to 450 degrees?
Chef can you do a popcorn maker
Never doubt a boss!   Love this series and love Alexis!! ❤️
Fish of any type is gross make your course fish free next time
that was gorgeous 😍😍😍
What can’t she do?
Washing machine???
Blinis are usually really small 😂😂😂 No, they’re not. They’re normally a lot bigger than a regular pancake
With only a popcorn machine
Your always over confident
With only a radiator
I guess during COVID you can’t have guest judges. That makes me a bit sad. I liked having her figure things out then others try to guess
So 👍 nice
The show is fun af luv it
blow torch!!
Next time dish washer😂
I read the title 3 times just to make sure I'm actually seeing the right thing!...it's getting craaaaaaazy in here 😂 keep it coming
she really melted chocolate and said, "I DID IT" love you Alexis, but that's nothing compared to your previous feats
Crepe  machine next pls!!! I love this series, and I think Alexis would enjoy it
Hotlogic!! Have her use a hotlogic!
This has become one of my favorite series
GMM already tried this lol
I wanna try all of them
🙄🙄😀😀😀
She is charming, has an aura that spark joyfulness in the video
I love how she always has an easier time with the things that aren't cooking tools. Also, I've used a hair straightener to cook before.
Candle =-=? ///Just kidding.
Can we all just take a moment to appreciate how long Alexis hair has grown
You're a genius Alexis ❤️🥺 I can't even use hair tools for my hairdos and here you are making a 3 course meal.. I literally just can't oh my god 👏🏻🙌🏻 hats off ❤️❤️❤️
3 course meal with candles!
Finallyyy
Can you use an omelette maker next???😅
Use only one candle...in next video plzzz👍🙏
I love this series
Can this chef make a 3 course meal with an ice cream machine?
Hey Alex , next episode , wax warmer!!
She makes the impossible possible
I love this series so much wow
This is a college hack series lol
Tasty is great since they go to these crazy series of cooking shows without actually losing the foundations of cooling while doing unconventional cooking
Next challenge: using the Hacksmith's lightsaber
I'm 58 seconds in and immediately thought popcorn kernel when she grabbed the straightener...I'll check back in after I watch the video to see if I'm right. 😅

Can you make a 3 course meal with children’s cooking pots and pans?
I think Alexis should make a three course meal with a heater (like the heaters that you plug in) I would love to see that!
Alexis don’t be scared, you can always do it, even if it’s not super easy
YT getting way too comfortable with double ads...
I know Alexis has cooked with an electric rice cooker, but what if she cooked with a steam pressure cooker? They're not that common in the US I think, so it might be worth a video.
I would want to eat ALL of them 😋😂
u should make something with a grill but very few knifes spoons and other equipment
Can you imagine that people in the year 3020 are probably going to watch this video and cringe so hard.
For the next episode, you can use lab equipments
she should do it with her body heat  waiting for it 🥰
3-course meal with a refrigerator aka Cold foods Or 3-course meal with a Chemistry set/Lab tools
I want to see alexis cook with a pressure cooker.
You should use a heat gun
Wait... U got fridge? Is it usually allowed?
Alexis came ready!!!
MAKE IT WITH A COTTON CANDY MACHINE PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Honestly I'm in love with this series💞
This is too easy, let’s think of something more difficult
“We can do something with 450!”  Me: *confused* but it’s already pretty ho- oh! Fahrenheit!
The next Appliance should be like candle
Omg finally I've seen a lot if hair straighter comments around And I wanted this exact same thing
I binge watch this series
This is my fav series on Tasty!

I can't explain why im so obsessed and so inlove with this series srsly. This is the only thing I look forward to each week now.
Well, how about...challenging Alexis to cook using a magnifying glass (we all know how it works right?! :P )?  (P.S: We love you Alexis!)
Next time please make food using water heater 🙏🙏
Her hairs are sooo long now 😁
Oh wow she's creative all right.
Use the sun to cook
I've been binge-watching chef out of water
a popcorn maker or a heat lamp would be interesting
They should make merch saying " this is gonna be a long day ".
Very well done Alexa! Buuuut: Can you cook a 3-course meal with a Dishwasher?
I feel Alexis is so underrated..... She tries so hard and is damn good at what she does. . . 💖
Soemthing tells me the next challenge is gonna be a nightmare.
What if she makes a 3 course meal with a clothing steamer? It’s heat but wet and it can get really hot but it’s a challenge 🤔🤭🤪
Who wants a roommate like Alexis when they r in college.
Do a vacuum cleaner next!🤗
make a 3 course meal with a car

A quote: A problem in life cover it with tinfoil                  -Alexis
I need to know if after they make all of the food the machines are still good to do their usually functions xd  I mean, can I still get my hair curly with that or is damage in someway?  It's not like I'm considering doing this at home...
I'm happy for Alexis. Well done!😀👏
Make it Can Alexis make a 3 couse meal 👏👏
Omg, she's back!!! I need to seriously read the title, cause wowww ALEXISS IS BACK😭
Imagine being able to use hair tools for food, when I can’t even use them for their purpose 👁👄👁
One of my favourite tasty series!!❤️❤️
I’ve followed chef out of water from beginning, from your short hair  And now it’s so long
Maybe with a magnifying glass...???
*kitchen torch, please*
Try to cook something on my cpu while I play a 2020 video game
wow u r a great chef Alexis  WELL DONE    G.O.A.T
Can this chef make a 3 course meal with kitchen torch?
do a handheld broiler or sous vide machine next!
Блины (blini) are flat and really big and wide. At least the blini we make here 😂. Not sure you made traditional ones. You guys are  so extra and fancy...even when you cook with hair tools.
"TURN IT UP! I'VE BEEN *WAITING* FOR THIS ONE!"
Try Making A 3-Course Meal With A Slow Cooker
I like to taste strawberry dip in chocolate
Hey tasty people..  Pls don't  stop this series
I can't even straighten my hair with this thing
I've never clicked faster in my life
I don’t even know how exactly am I supposed to use my hair tools for their intended purpose n alexis here is cooking with them...😂😂😂
I really really want to see her use a pressure cooker. If she can make amazing things using hair tools she would do  awesome using a pressure cooker as well
Try it with only electric heater
Awesomeee..eithout alexis this show wouldn’t be fun...
Hey Alexis. Can you make a 3 course meal with just ONE thing? It could be anything. A bowl of hot water for instance.
Can you please make a 3 course meal with a solar oven. Aka the sun
Can you try a Popcorn Maker/Machine?
I LOVE alexis.
An overheated laptop is the only way to go now
You should cook a 3 course meal using mini appliances. Love u Alexis and tasty ❤️❤️❤️
Wheres make it big? I WANT MAKE IT BIG
People should start trying her food and guess what she made it with again.
Ok lowkey horrifying we use this on our hair...
She can make delicious meals out of a hair straightener and a clothing iron and power tools and the thing that gives her PTSD is a microwave? Really?
Love how Alexis seems to have more problems with actual cooking appliances than with hair tools.
Make a meal with the sun
Cooking on a car?
Just can't understand why you guys think blinis are small 😅 they actually are the size of frying pan 🤷🏼‍♀️
We still want Alexis to cook with the sun
How about car tools
I love this series and I was just binging it when i saw this :)
QUEEN
oh this is quality entertainment.

The new background is actually very pretty ❤️❤️
I just had a haircut 💇‍♂️ and boom this video comes ultra coincidence
3 course meal with a car!!

Why use the fridge when you can put it infront of the air conditioner.
Have her use only a stand mixer. She’s been complaining about not having one.
Alexis try a steamer maybe??
I'm starting to think that Alexis makes these 3-course meals for videos AND as her dinner  Anyone with me? 👇🏻
How about a three course meal with a pizza oven!
There is no can the chef do it's how the chef does it-
Next time please give her bunch of candles and she gonna cook three cource meal on candle i challenge you tasty
Try making a meal with just a salad spinner, that would be v impressive 😄
What about cooking in the heat of a  motor in a car ?

Hot glue gun

You're so talented chef!!
Alexis certainly aces this series, she's great!
Make 3 meals with an electric kettle
Please do a 3 course meal with fryer or ari fryer
Can Alex prepare a 3 course meal with an Immersion circulator??
Can someone make a movie out of the stuff she has discovered she cook food out of? Like some kind of survival movie where they have no choice but to cook like she does in this series? 😂
Refrigerator next please <3
I just love to watch her ❤️ she's so cute 🥺
Love you so much!~~~
cant we get a friend or someone to taste it too
Whaaaat!?
For how overworked their employees are, I really hope they’re giving her an amazing pay for the millions of views she racks in
how about a kettle next?
Well done, Alexis! I am not a big fan of strawberries, but those looked beautiful. I would happily try the appetizer and main course, they looked scrumptious!
Use a kettle next
Can she make 3 course meal in a fridge and freezer 😉
This one was pretty quick and stress free 😂
You should try cooking with a radiator 😂
Next, Alexis makes a three course meal using a clothes dryer! Haha lol
Next time use a hand mixer, let's see what you can come up with
I do like this series....but there's a problem  EVEN THOUGH THE PEOPLE AT "TASTY" MAKE AWESOME FOOD ❤️ (LOVE IT❤️) BUT THEY SHOULD NOT WASTE FOOD LIKE THIS.  yours sincerely Potato chips (😂)
well... at least they gave more than one hair straightener and hair dryer
Dear Alexis, love literally all you do! But - and I'm not hte first one here - it's not Russian blini you've made, yours are way too small. The Russian blini do look rather like crepes. Maybe it's an American version, don't know.
Next, she will cook using a dryer
Try cooking with a PC processor!!!
3 course with lab equipments
a popcorn machine
how about 3 course meal with electric tandoor ?
next ep: food processer
First it was panckaes with a microwave then creps(dutch pancakes) then it was japanese pancakes and now russian😂😂😂

You should make a meal with a handmixer
Imagine being pinned by Tasty

next ep: use some science laboratory items
washing machine next plzzzzz
SHE IS SO CUTE
she’s always asking for a hand mixer, give her what she wants
this just shows that alexis can make food wit anything............... shes damn talented
I’ve said this many times before, and I’ll say it again. Alexis always asks for a stand/hand mixer, so give her one! She’s cooked with a blender before, so we know she doesn’t *need* heat to make a three course meal, so why not?
‘Can this chef make a 3- course meal with a candle.’🕯🕯
One day Nothing will be given to alexis and title of the video will be  "cook a three course meal with nothing " 🙄🙄😂😂
Oh here come the "I can't even boil water" comments.
Chocolate covered strawberries
"Can This Chef Cook A 3-Course Meal With Hair Tools? " Of course, Alexis can cook with almost anything, even if things can get a bit hair-raising sometimes.
One of my favorite series ❤❤❤
Tasty go back tk your old kitchen
Most requested one
I miss when people would try to guess what she used
She should do fryer next time

Ik this doesn't matter but she used the fridge!😮😅

Omg..HOW DO YOU DO THIS
Has the solar cooker been done ?! If not it would be AWESOME !!
How about 3 courses from an ice cream maker?
This is crazyy
I mean, I could cook grilled cheese with an iron and I could iron my clothes with straightener, so I think I could cook grilled cheese with a straightener~
Chef Cook A 3-Course Meal With television please <3

I now firmly believe that Alexis can make anything out of anything, she is some sort of magician in the kitchen
Can This Chef Cook a 3-Course Meal With a Toaster........Again?
Alexis, you should try and make a 3 course meal with some laboratory items like a small burner, flasks, and test tubes
It's amazing how she struggled to cook with a microwave but aced it with hair tools lmao
NEVER END THIS SERIES
This is the first video that she rated 10 out of 10 for everything
It’s to easy for her. I’m so proud 🥰
I still remember in the very first episode that her hair was short😂
cooking using the sun with magnifying lenses is very interesting haha
The curler and the straightener kinda look like alligator faces :D
Remember when Buzzfeed Food used to be a thing?
Yay
Boiling water!
😁💕💕💕
Блины("blini") are crepes she's done оладьи
She is the hero of all college students
Loved this absolutely.. ❤❤❤
What if next she uses a hot glue gun? Lol  Minus the hot glue of course!
I love this chefs voice! Its so relaxing! xD
This is making me cringe so much
Hot Glue Gun-Bathtub
Hi
Try an electric kettle? 😅
2200: can this chef make 3 course meals with the sun?
Disgusting
I don’t know if they’re a meal, but she definitely accomplished three pretty decent-looking canapés?
Who else is trying to start a YouTube channel in 2020? Let's build together
Use a stove but no bowl pots or pans only things she can multipurpose (i.e. like only able to use a kids toy set for utensils)
please do a kettle next! like so tasty can see this comment C:
FINALLY!!!!!!!
She's getting good at this chef out of water thing. Let's make it difficult 😂
OMG HAHAHA this has been long awaited!
This made my night. Wow! She’s amazing chef 👩‍🍳 💯❤️ 😋😋😋😍
Can This Chef Cook a 3-Course Meal With a Bread Maker?
Can this chef make a 3 course meal with a candle
I love her

Rie: Make it Fancy Alvin: Make it Big Inga: Make it Trendy Alexis: Make it Happen..?
I swear to God i have never clicked this fast
You should do cooking under a nail lamp
Cook with a room heater
This just keeps getting crazier and crazier... Hats off to Alex before seeing the video!
no one: ... college students:
I love your energy Alexis! You are the reason I watch this for sure 🙂 Are you working from home?
Have you guys tried a regular hand mixer?
Hi tasty
Can you make a three course meal with candle
YOUR VIDEOS MAKE ME DROOLING!!😊😋🤤
thats enough internet for today
It's not that I don't trust her objectivity, but I think it's just more fun if someone else tasted the food. Or maybe it's just me 😅
Yeas, but can you cook a 3 course meal with a popcorn machine? ( Without making popcorn)
Waooooo
Electric water heater please
I remember the first time I watched Alexis, I only did it bc I thought she looked like Emma Thompson and I absolutely adore Emma so since then I've been watching Alexis and I love everything about her and this series💜
Make a 3 course meal using a Car Engine 🤣
Ohh superb
1:18 Alexis, telling the temps, wait what they’re good. And then I realize she’s talking about Fahrenheit
I never knew how blini are viewed outside of Russia 😃 because in Russia they are big, like crepes, but very thin. And yes, you can eat them with cream and salmon or caviar, but meat, tvorog (something like ricotta), smetana (something like Greek yogurt) or condensed milk are muuuuch more common.
Her confidence level got more realistic😅
I just love this series plus her voice is just soothingly relaxing
I was literally thinking about the straightener part lol
FINALLY
Alexis with random ass tools that produce heat : Michelin star dishes *chefs kiss*😘  Alexis with gadgets that are actually used for food: DISASTER STRIKEs  * flashbacks to microwave and tOasTer* 😖😨😄😂
Me russian listening to what she says about "blinis" like  wtf 👁️👄👁️
Which is your favorite? - Chef out of water - Make it BIG - Make it fAnCy
Ewww Alexis                      - David Rose
Can she make a three course meal with an oven but no pots, pans, utensils, oven safe dishes etc...
The only series i enjoy from tasty
girls getting bored and watching this gives them ideas hahaha
Wwwwwwooooooooowwwwweew I love you 😘💗💕❤️💞💟😘
cook with a gaming pc
Just for fun I ate it with implements from my shave kit.
Can you do bread maker next!
Anyone else think we need her to use solar powered items/the sun
It’s kinda sad that she’s at her best right now but no one else can taste what she’s making
Don't ever stop this show. This show is very interesting to watch.  I wish i could taste all ur dishes . Next time  make a three course meal with laboratory  items
You should give her only a hand mixer She keeps asking for it
To anyone reading this May you become successful one day and get everything in your life
I love the sandwich and strawberries very much. Made me hungry haha 😋😋😋  PS: Can you try cooking with laboratory tools? I think that would be fun. 😇
The people who disliked the video were Hairstylists
Yasssss BTW I have a request pls pls make a series where there will be a competition against all the series like make it fancy vs chef out of water vs making it big vs eating ur feed etc Also next appliance should be a car!
How about a kettle next?
Can Alexis make a 3-course meal with the sun?
tasty after few days  "can this chef cook food using car engine?"
😂😂
Just what I want! More of my wife's hair in my food.
So far all of these 3-course meal ideas have used appliances that provide heat in a weird way. What about replacing the other kitchen tools? How about cooking a meal ONLY with construction tools, no knives, cutting board, whisk, other kitchen supplies. You could use a lathe to spiral veggies/potatoes, other cutting tools which could be really effective for large cuts of meat, blow torch for heat.
No one: Me: counting the no. of the "broke college students" Comments
Really loving and enjoying this content! Love ya Alexis, you rock! 👌🏻❤️ I’m literally hungry right now. 🤦🏻‍♀️🤣
Was waiting for this 😭😭😭😭
yes please never stop this show please tasty....love alexis 😍
Rice cooker NEXT!
oh dear
I'm Russian and we always make блины. I think that you did pretty well!
Use a sandwich maker.
Give her electric kettle to cook 3 course meal
I would eat all but the salmon, I’m not a seafood person. Looked great! Try using lab tools (not my idea) or dare I say, a sink!
actually russian blini are more like crepes. They are thinner and bigger in diameter, so you can make it in a roll  or eat with fork and knive. As russian I never have seen something like you show in this video
Me : finding difficulties cooking with normal kitchen utensils Alexis : So today we're gonna make a 3 course meal, WITH HAIR TOOLS
do one with battery or led light  only
can we talk about how pretty she is
After seeing this video using them for hair feels tad weird 😂
Am I the only one that thinks some things are better left alone....???
You should do office supplies next.   A laminator  A pencil sharpener An exacto knife Etc.
Next time blow torch
Next: can this chef cook from just the heat of her hands?
Alexis - secretly training us for the apocalypse.
i missed her.....
Am I the only one bothered by the fact the hair straightener gets to bread baking temperature and people use that on their hair?
Her REACTION when she opened the box   HIYAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH   XDDDDDDDD
Eventually it'll reach "Can This Chef Cook a 3-Course Meal With A Lighter?" at which point she goes postal and uses the lighter all over the kitchen.
As I'm waking up and just starting the video I notice that the surface area of a straightening iron looks about the size of a strip of bacon 🥓
You should do an episode with a blow torch only
Cook a 3 course meal with a rock next!
Love u❤❤
Me, Russian, watching the segment about blini and being super confused 'cause blini in Russia are usually way bigger than American pancakes. Seeing her making them sooo small and saying that's ok was like.. why?
so now we know the heat we use on our hair is just perfect to make food.
That was way to easy for you. 🙃
BLOWTORCH ❤️😭 PLEASE
Alexis has the best job
She should cook with a space heater next time
Hi
Yesssssss
I think she should make 3 course meal with washing machine
Why have they stopped getting suprise taste tester .
Watch her survive the apocalypse. WATCH HER SURVIVE AN APOCALYPSE, because I'm telling you she'll do it.
How about using science reaction? Like chemical or something (that actually safe) it's sounds cool and also good, you can use with like dry ice or another stuff that give a reaction so it can cook the food
Next up- can a tasty chef make a 3 course meal with a blender?
This was a great episode 🔥
Me as a man: How tf am I gonna make toast with a comb?

I am ready to give up vegetarianism just to eat that sandwich
I was thinking Wat could it b with the big box
I would Eat the Sandwich.. If it's not medium Rare.
I guess I'll come back when the comments are more marinated
I was just looking through to find I’ve watched everything! Just in time for a new video
Love this series :)))
The day they stop this series is the day I delete YouTube 😂 anyone else agree? 👇
i think the reason why she’s been doing better with her challenges is because she doesn’t have to worry about a surprise taste tester
I guess its a bit too much but can this chef cook three course meals in a *tandoor* although people do it a lot but can she look Halal western style meals in tandoor? Never commented any challenge yet so far 😌
So yummy
Hand mixer
Can u do a electric kettle please?
Next episode should be a heater
I can only imagine how long this took
Blinis are not small. Usually they are little bigger than hand. (And yes, I from Russia)
What a coincidence!?? I came to look for Alexis series here and found her uploaded video wow!!!! 😍
I should show this to my mom that has a salon lol
You're not gonna believe that after I finished binge watching Fish out of Water earlier, I wished for a blow dryer to be used next. And it has been in my mind for the rest of the day 😳
Did we had the Sandwich maker? :)
They finally brought those hair tools to this series 😂😂😂
Nyam nyam 😋yummy👌
Hunn That's not what "blini" are Not at all
So basically....alexis didn’t want hair stuffie  But we did:)
Okay these blini are DEFINITELY wrong, but I appreciate the effort
Can this chef 👩‍🍳  Cook with a grill
How about a steamer basket for the next episode
Next time cook with a candle
Alexis the fish never stays in water
As a Russian girl...I’ve never seen blini like this. Usually they look more like french crepes and not like pancakes🤨🤨 but still good work Alexis🥰
IM SO EXCITED FOR THIS EPISODE!!
Honestly, this is the best cooking series ever.
