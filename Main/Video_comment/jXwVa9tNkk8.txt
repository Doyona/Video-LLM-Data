Myself I don’t care much about the interior I like the way it is …  People they doesn’t buy the interior the buy the power as you said … If someone needs nice interior can buy Audi BMW MERCEDES BENZ and LEXUS in less than 90K
Its peanut butter/jelly  interior/exterior
I still smile like an idiot *every time* I start mine and it's been almost 3 years.
I think that it s not true about auto wipers- there is no inscription in lever but they worked in auto mode. But of course people dont mind about it if the have such a power motor inside)
Forgot to mention, only in a straight line
In 15 years these r gonna be worth about 3000 in todays money...
Those unpainted hoods look trashy. And cheap and childish.
These cars wasn’t built for luxury they were built for power.  If you want luxury buy a luxury car 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
faster than a rari
Hey Doug….. have you done a Charger R/T ? Wish you would!
The numbers climb so fast you can't even count It fast enough
TTTTTTTTTTTTHHIISSSSSSSSSSS
aged like milk
Remmember when bmw e39 was the fastest sedan!
Thats a jailbreak
One of the things I like about doug is that he usually has a good idea of *why* people pay amounts money for certain cars and *why* they like them. Props to him for that.
Can all that plastic hold at 200mph????
There’s a difference between a $90,000 luxury car and a $90,000 sports car
Well, the LD platform was launched in 2011 so the charger interior was barely changed. I have a 2012 SRT8 and for me is kinda luxurious, it's very comfortable and beautiful.
Chargers have nice interiors it's called a chrysler 300
Also I believe it is the last true American Sedan. Think about it, it is currently the only full size car that does not promise luxury.
Thats the same camera as the dodge dart lol
The dodge brothers are smiling. In laughing their ass off that Henry Ford.
Purple over peanut butter is an homage to the PBJ. Grape jelly and peanut butter
I like to see you driver this car 200 miles  in hours 🤣😆
Peanut-Butter & Jelly … 🔥
Bmw m5
Hey Doug! I'm a guy from Italy and I've been following your videos from some years by now and I found them really accurate and precise... What about reviewing some cars which could be relatively "popular" in your country but we guys from Europe are not that used to see them much around... For example I'm talking about challengers or chargers from late 60s/early 70s, gtos from 60s-70s, Shelbys from the 60s, early 70s cudas ecc. I think this kind of videos would be also very appreciated in your country...
I guess the only place you can stress this car out is on the Autoban
I can't wait to hear more straight piped Chargers flooring it down my street at 11pm on a Tuesday.
Faster than a Tesla Plaid?
Jay Leno is that you?
Let me guess what Dodge will make next year: Charger SRT Demon
Dang wth
I don’t usually like purple cars, but this color looks really good on this one
Ohmygod
Dodge Chrysler is still the same I guess. Lots of horsepower and just as much cheap plastic.
"I love you too Son!"
"The ultimate Dodge charger for now" he correctly assumed that Dodge would make something faster than a Redeye which is the new Jailbreak!!!
Drove my dad's Redeye last night.  What a f'n dream. Big upgrade from my 2014 Ford Fusion ;)
I need this guys knees
i would love a V6 charger with 6 speed manual and a mid liftkit just to cruise dirt roads
I wonder if this car is faat
Should've bought this instead of my M5 CS and placed the extra cash saved under my mattress.
Bro peanut butter and jelly how didn’t u get that ? Lmao
you are able to customize your own dodge on their website and the redeye is around 95-108 k after all modern applications you mentioned were missing, so u can have all that stuff, but the person who let you use their car went cheap.
In Dodge, you get only what you need, and not what you want in an interior, and everything you don't need, but want under the hood.
Doug just nut himself
90 grand for all the horsepower you can’t use unless you go a drag strip.
Wrong! Tesla Model S is much faster. All these models claim “the fastest” are piece of shit now.
Moms Ford Taurus station wagon
“Fastest sedan on the planet”  Tesla Model S Plaid: *hold my beer*
Why didn’t he just say peanut butter and jelly?😂 opportunity missed
Everyone from section 8 is foaming out the mouth rn
Living in South Florida (Miami area) I'd see one of these wrecked weekly!
The Polestar 2 wouldn’t win but I bet the Lucid Air would probably give it a run for it’s money. Although it’s not in the same category but I’d like to see a video of those two go neck to neck.
Why don’t you review a Challenger Redeye?
Every thing bad u listed about the charger besides the backup camera can be optioned out.
I'd rather buy an M5
Tesla plaid enters the room....
Doug you gonna mess them knees up on the concrete
“The 2021 Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat Is The World’s Fastest Sedan”  Tesla Model S Plaid: allow me to introduce myself
Thanks God I will buy one for myself
This car is soo sick 🔥🔥🔥
300,000 dollar car comparison only in a drag race..  Car has horrible braking and handling characteristics
Needs 4 wheels drive
That’s what I think my 07 Camry CE sounds like
the interior color combined with the exterior color is smth i like to call pb&j
I got a scatpack drove a hellcat and there gay definetly dont enjoy, my bmx bike has better HP n Weight so all and all id say BUY IT ITS GREAT!!
Imagine complaining ab the interior of this car, in use to driving a shitty 2010 vehicle, the interior on this car looks nearly luxurious to me🤣 has everything I would use, a Bluetooth radio💀
Pour olive looks like a yummy place. Good for the heart.
You have 800 hp, so don't complaint...
Supercharger whines are so good
Some or the other day they will make a Charger SRT Super Stock.
Gt500 is the fastest not this
I say everyone should Hellcat all the cars. Nissan Leaf? Hellcat it. Mazda MX5? Hellcat it. Tesla Model 3? Hellcat it. No more wars, everyone would be busy drifting their cars around
To be honest, I’m not a big fan of technology a lot of the times. It’s kind of nice to see a car that is an old school muscle car and is still truly legendary. Well done Dodge.
This hellcat is the peanut butter and jelly special addition hellcat
Not bad design with door americans are fat they that need that door to open.
My 2015 charger RT has adaptive cruise control
Dodge is actually really refreshing.  This car is just childish but how can you not love it?  I hate the owners of Chargers but the car is wonderful.
Tryna go to heaven but I ...
I'm pushing 40 yrs old... It's time
Biggest quirk is that heinous purple color
People in my city would kill for this  Edit: I’m from Detroit Michigan
Purple is a throwback to the Plymouth Prowler
Laughs in Evo 9😹😹
Love that paint color
Was going to get one when my warranty on scat was almost up , new hellcats were 60-70k when I got my scat (fair prices). But now all the chevys fords and dodges are marking up the highest and even increasing starting msrp before the markup , now I’m looking into a Mercedes or bmw. No wayyyyyyy am I dropping 100k on a dodge, the service dept is cut rate attitudes, so to spend 100k and deal with that? Not a chance
Most fastest and most powerful are completely different
i thought the model s plaid was
THISSS
M5CS faster
This dude talks about the car like hes about to give it a blow job
Now with tesla, and other ev supercars are rising up and are faster than any other petrol cars. I personally don't mind them and think they are good if they aren't ugly af.
7:38 My 2017 Chrysler 300 has adaptive cruise very weird that the charger does not have it.
On the highway, in the hellcat and it sound like optimus prime
Whats funny is its not even $300k dollar performance worth. Lol all it can do is go fast. It cant hit corners well, it cant launch for shit, its just not a sports car lol. Its JUST a very fast sedan lol… but the worst part, ONLY guys like it lol females dont give two fs about a hellcat lol and i do it for the hoes. 💪🏾🤣
model s plaid has entered the chat
Not gona lie very underimpressed with the interior that being said i’m aware if goy buy one of these you aren’t looking for the most comfortable ride lol.
It’s peanut butter and jelly
A legendary car that will forever be established in vehicle history.
And now it's a Tesla model s plaid
Koenigsegg gemera walk in*
The Australian equivalent would probably be the walkinshaw W557. Think with embossed logos in the seat and console and everything they were about $200,000 Australian dollars, which today would be around $145,000 USD.  You’re actually pretty spoilt over there for what ya get for ya money 💰
Now it’s the plaid
My daughter (6 years old) told me she had a dream where I was driving her around in my “bright green super kitty car”. I showed her several cars in bright green, and when she got to a sublime hellcat her eyes lit up.  Guess I gotta go get one now. Doesn’t come in sublime? Gotta wrap it.
No because the Tesla s plaid is a sedans and faster by alot
That's a fly whip! 💯
Faster than the 2021 m5cs?
Title should read, "Worlds Most Stolen Sedan"
the only thing that matters for this car is the sound
Jesus christ died for our sins and one day he'll come back to get all the ones that have been faithful please repent from your sins and give Jesus a chance if you haven't yet the end is near
Why would you put a wireless phone charger in a car that fast the phone would just fly out if you got on the gas a little bit
The color name was funny 🤣
Peanut Butter Inside, outside Jelly…
Please review "TATA Nano" the cheapest car in the world
The interior looks cheap
Can go 200 mph when the speed limit is 65mph. What a waste.
This is the car you want if you want to die early
7:00 there is a package that you can get that says "Charger" when you open the door.
the most ugly hellcat there is
I love that dark purple paint! Reminds me of bam margera's old lambo back in the day!
It's a carryover of thinking from the old taxicab Road Runner... Think about it 🙂
Your videos are just awesome dude. I respect you even more for not going over board with the ads. I appreciate being able to watch your videos with to many interruptions
"fastest sedan in the world" only to get gapped by an M5CS 😂
I thought the Bentley flying spur or the Alpina B7 are the fastest sedans In topspeed
Peanut butter and jelly combo color? Not bad
Wrong, the Nissan Altima is the world’s fastest sedan.
Doug wanna get his arse in a plaid this u looking at is obsolete technology
Inside peanut butter outside jelly
*The car itself is a wireless charger* 🤓
The exact same video as the charger srt wide body
It’s weird the the challenger comes with higher tech than the charger
As if a 200+mph car at $90K isn't a bargain in itself....let's complain about missing nanny electronics.
Rumor has it if you cut off this guy’s arms, he’d loose the ability to talk.
You did not talk about the brakes, suspension, only the hood and air that goes in! Slaking, slaking
Bro a Tesla model s plaid would roll a charger red eye and it’s a sedan
Can car and bids send cars overseas
10% of people in this comment section understands it’s a hellcat redeye. Not a luxury car.
Such an awesome car
Every vehicle:  We going electric  Dodge: *Have this v12 5000hp Minivan*
I absolutely love this color combo!!!  I'm gonna order my Redeye just like this but with the full black pkg (hood+roof+rear spoiler). Black, White Knuckle, Indigo Blue & Hellraisin are my top favorites. They look good in every color. Its also cool that you can choose the seatbelt and caliper colors too, especially with the Jailbreak models!
Earlier this month I was doing Lyft Lux/XL in Tysons Corner, VA (outside DC) and was omw to a rider going to the airport. Soon as I answered the request a Charger Hellcat blew my doors off. I was already rollin and going 80 myself @ 4am in my nearly 6,000lb Escalade ESV. That nasty HC shook my truck like I was in a Prius, they had to be doing 180+ on I-495, no mercy! Then 30 seconds later 3 VSP cruisers flew by me "trying" to chase it and they failed miserably smh. I'm a cop myself and the only way you're catching a HC is if they get spiked, road blocked, crash, run out of gas or simply stop and let you lock them up.
i wonder if ram will put this engine into the ram trx to take out the ford raptor r
well the engine sells for $60,000 minimum for a hellcat engine no I know that’s not what the dealers pay for it but remember technically you’re buying a $30,000 Dodge charger with a hellcat engine in it
12:01 shocked and not surprised
4 door muscle car 🤮
Don’t complain you have 800 horsepower you don’t need the extra options
My boy out there wit the peanut butter and jelly cat 🐱 😂😂🔥
That SRT Hellcat moment @9:29 😂  whispers, “oh my God!”
The way he said 🗣️ttrhjisis I thought it was the car starting up 🤣🤣😭
I'm sorry for a sedan that cost over 80,000 and from the things Doug points out, Your paying for the 800hp and there are many other sedan that cost less than this, with many more options and interior details for less. But for a car that cost as much as this isn't Worth it if your gonna pay that type of money you better make, it fully decked out, even Doug said when you open the car door, there no logo on the panels, I think for the cost of the car Dodge could put more effort, into adding more features in the interior of the car.
For the money you get performance and a decent warranty  Other than that for 100k you should jst build something
Quality has always been the issue doesn’t matter if it’s a red eye or scat if you let the car sit in the heat for a day the interior will will come unglued and your screen will bubble up and fry
I’d be like a little school girl driving it that car just laughing because it has more power than half the cars on the roaf
In 10 years this car will be worth close to a million. No more true American muscle, all electric BS from now on. It’s sad 😢
What is automatic wipers??? Can u tell me
Still loses to bmw m5 cs ://
you are good  thanks for the video
Sad news: *2023 marks the end of Hellcat production*
God bless Dodge !  Crazy coke snorting engineers over there 😅.
Not faster than the plaid
Tesla is faster than this lol tesla is a sedan to 1100 hp
Fastest sedan. I doubt that...
‘Fastest sedan on the market’….. until you have to make a turn….
The M5CS is faster
what a waste of money
My insurance agent- "You bought a what??"
Bought my Optima from a huge Dodge lot and saw all these new Chargers, Challengers, Durangos etc. They had the Grand Wagoneer in the lobby. But i still left proud with my Optima and someday il be back..
90K for the motor basically
Who opens the door that far anyway
10s from the factory. 🇺🇸
Looks like crap. Dodge rounded the car off too much.
"For $90,000 you might be getting a $40,000 car interior"...more like an $18,000 interior
doug is a b
Not the fastest sedan anymore
Bad video and bad commentary +dislike +ratio +white
When they end production of the charger and challenger we all know its gonne be last muscle car and its gonna get the send off of the most power possible
An m5 would bitch on it. It’s not fastest sedan.
I'm going to get me a hellcat red eye lol
If they did a full interior overhaul they could prob get another 5 years out of this body style
You could learn to play 🎸 to get p or you could spend 90G to get p, your choice.
This dudes fuckin annoying , homie the car cost so much is because of the performance not the interior
That’s that PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY PACK
cheapest interior ever... American cars suck at interior and exterior design
Attn: all hellcats owners PLEASE protect your SRTs and Trackhawks!! they're being stolen at a high rate these days. SHOOT ON SITE if you see thieve tryna steal yo shit!!
Rear tire width size? You mentioned the fronts at 305. . Guessing like 355 or 375. Anyone know?
Doug the type of dude to have a 3TB hard drive of CP in his basement       lol jk sorry I actually fux w/his channel
2040: This car is a classic, you kids will never understand the joy of manual gas ⛽ powered cars.
Fastest sedan but m5cs can bet it sooo which one is the worlds fastest?
My 2008 CTS 3.6di has automatic wipers 😂 it probably has double the features.. but man, I'm certainly still looking to buy a Redeye lol.
Idk about fastest sedan that's one bold claim if I've ever heard one
Car review on a hellcat done in the suburbs, whoa must've broke 50MPH.
Is not the fastest in the planet dummy Bugatti have more than 1000 horsepower
This car screams FTP! 🖕👮‍♂️
Still ain't faster then a Tesla Plaid Model S....that thing is kicking ass all over the drag strip! It doesn't matter what model charger or Challenger you have! You gon get ya ass ate up!! Period
You're not even really paying for the power when m3s, tesla, and hell some mustangs and camaros are destroying the hellcat on the track. You're paying for the sound and for the charger....4 doors....
I would call the color scheme of this specific car: the PB&J Edition 🤣
Fastest? Tesla sedans are faster.
Really not much more interior features compared to my 2012 300s interior…
Doug doesn’t get his hands dirty…
Whats the mpg? 1 mile per gallon?
The fastest sedan is the 2021 b7 alpina
Hell cat are Trash it's not all about power its about proformance and reliable. Weight to power sucks
My 2010 Mazda 3 has automatic wipers 😅 costed 2,000 CDN better than dodge LMAO not really but I can wish
The future will be expensive-muscle and electric.
Could you imagine going 200 mph in a Dodge?
I can picture Doug cruisin in one of these through Atlanta  "TTTTTTHIIISSSSSS....is the hood"
Not the fastest anymore
This guy is mad he needs help plz help him he's need a friend
Elon dethroned that boat lol
I'll take one for free...make a review on it....you know.
Plaid is the fastest sedan in the world 🌎
800hp and 6000 pounds.🤣 13.5 in a quarter.
Was the fastest sidan in the world. This car got horrible break. Horrible steering in corners. Interior is outdated. Yeah it s fast. But for that price. The car needs more than just an engine
I saw on a different video it’s called a redeye because it’s a demon possessed hellcat. Explains the amazing amount of power.
The door handles wouldn’t even bother me those are the kind I have on my current car and if you care about the interior a lot buy a luxury car not a muscle car
I have a 2016 challenger rt and my windshield wipers are automatic...
I like how most of other car manufacturers are cutting down the emissions and converting to electric to be "greener",  and Dodge is like "hehe 800hp sedan go brrrrrrrr"
No yellow front bumper guards smh definitely not the fastest 😒they took off a good 100hp each 😤😤
The tachometer also doubles as the fuel needle.  🙄
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWSYxPJYLo&ab_channel=ThrottleHouse
Could u please say “its joey from joey super cool food reviews…….wooo wooo wooooooo”
First video I’ve actually watched all the way thru. Good job. You didn’t make me bored. Stayed on point. Keep it up!
One thing I like about dodge is that they don’t add hood scoops for “looks” but the hood scoops on this car actually take in air. Thank you dodge for making this my dream car.
They should definitely revamp the interior n make it all digital and make everything all screens HD definitely the back up camera
That engine sounds gooooooooddd!!
Gets in an 800hp car, doesn't take it on the highway
Sprzedawca idiot
If it were and AWD.  It would kill all. But thats wistful thinking. But a 300 redeye would of been more
I seriously doubt, that trash dodge handles and feels anything like a $300k Lambo or Ferrari or Porsche. You can put 800 hp in a Honda Accord.
The interior is what ALWAYS kept me from buying a Charger! It’s just so blah! Not paying 90k for performance I can’t use 95% of the time AND the interior is crap! 😫
bro i cant find thoes they all sold out
That  "this" in the start is reel content iykyk
Waz
M5 cs would disagree lol
Re-watching this I really can't help but roll my eyes at Doug saying that the Charger isn't nice. Sure it's old-fashioned and doesn't have the full luxury suite, but it's still a comfortable, reasonable and practical (minus the Hellcat's fuel consumption) car. My ma has a late-model GLC Merc and she said the R/T Charger was nicer, and I sure as hell would take one over my '09 S40.
The BMW M5 CS Tans it in Drag race and on a rolling start yet BMW M5 CS has only under 700 BHP ?
This guy was just bashing the car this whole video
hey doug I'm james howlett im in the simulated world
Nobody buys this car just to use adaptive cruise control
Americans "The Redeye is the fastest sedan in the world" BMW M5 CS " Hold my deutsches beer" Redeye gets destroyed
Do one on the scatpack
MOPOWAHBABEH
A dodge charger 500 is better
No cruise control... Interesting....
Where would people use all that 800HP? I mean if someone wants to outrun the police while robbing a bank, sure a hellcat makes sense. Other than that, you’ll end up with shitload of police traffic tickets to make use of all that 800hp…
The auto windshield wipers are on my 2014 dodge dart 💀💀
What about the Dodge demon??
Brilliant.
This guy’s voice makes doves cry…..😭
Tesla Model S plaid has entered the chat
When you buy a hellcat 90% of owners take out the interior anyway the amount of seats missing and weight reduction makes sense cheap plastic easy removal
i call the color combo "the elementary lunch choice"
Bentley flying spur top speed 210 mp/h
And that’s without adding aftermarket super chargers.    You can make that thing push 850 hp
no it isn't , it is the Tesla Plaid
8:43 that's funny🤣
Whats the difference with the 50k scat pack wide body besides 30k? looks like same engine.
It isn't even first 20 if you take it around the corners. For example on Nurburgring. Cars like this can't corner.
2020 flying spur is faster. 207mph
Police company be like:I'll take your entire stock!!
and you see how y’all be in debt. This is like 500/month, gad prolly is 60-75$, maintenance is like 600/month, and y’all be the same ones buying it just to drive it normal, like if u gone do that just get a 2015 civic 🤷🏾‍♂️, and if u drive it hard you’ll end up crashing it anyways 😕
Dear its 85,000 i will buy BMW 760i with full full options, i dont need aircraft, i need A high speed car with full options
I love that supercharger whine 🤩🤩🤩
This is my dream car
Wtf Doug driving through Dilworth. He should have wove through traffic with all the other chargers on 77
Inside peanut butter outside jelly 🎵
model s plaid be like:  child's play
Dodge needs to put lime green to the hellcats 🔥🔥💯💯💯
My 2010  civic has better interior
Can't wait for 20 years when this guy finally hits 40k and becomes a regular car
Plaid is faster.
The interior could be made of rotting cheese I don't care
Dodge is giving the common man a chance to drive a piece of insanity.
Bro hating on the colour combo like it ain’t pb & j one of the most iconic combos
can picture a shithead kid driving this and it gets totaled within a week
Idc what you say I like that interior
Peanut butter and grape jelly
You can close the door as you get in
The best statement against the "great reset"!
CTS-V >
That’s gotta be a pain to fill-up after a day of driving
Doug: The Dodge Charger Redeye is the fastest sedan in the world!! Elon Musk: and I took that personally...
eew..
American Muscle baby.
Pois é!
I'm happy with the rt/ hemi...I could only imagine the redeye
https://youtu.be/h5cNy8iSU8c
complaining about no auto windshield wipers just screams the personality you have.  What happens when you live in california. You start thinking and acting like a white girl
All young dudes atlanta driving these cars very dangerous situation car fast they crashing killing folks
That’s called peanut butter&jelly.  Like the 3 six mafia song. Lol.
Peanut butta jelly, peanut butta jelly
You’d think the guy could dress batter than a 12 year old at summer camp. Just to have at little a little class. But hell no, let’s look like an immature brat.
800 hp and refinement of a lawnmower. Typical American performance cars.
Idk but a bullbar would like nice on this car
The tesla plaid is watching this like 👀
That color is just so damn beautiful😍
Omfg those revs sounded Amazing 👌💯🔥🔥🔥🤯🥵
Well, it was the fastest for a while. The Tesla S Plaid is 1050 HP and significantly quicker. 9.24 1/4 mile. The Tesla doesn't sound nearly as cool, and costs about $40K more, but if you want the lowest 1/4 mile times ever available from a factory stock car, it's the current king of the hill (June 2021)
My latest dream car going on my vision board 😀
As a European I can say that this is a hell lot of a car for this price. It is a true bargain to be honest. Such a car (a new Dodge Charger Hellcat Redeye) costs here around 80-90k EUR in Germany. For Poland it is additional 18% due to the displacement over 2.0 liters.
When people see this car in India. People may notice it. This car is way more subtle than any super car in india.
No automatic wipers bro...
Could they make it any uglier? Lol driven mainly by senior citizens 👊
I just ordered one, see it in 3 month.
Bentley Flying Spur W12 is faster...
Imagine being stuck in rush hour in the thing not being able to move. I'd need to be somewhere with some more open roads that's not downtown Chicago to really be able to enjoy that piece. Looks dope af though but downtown it would get a.) stole b.) broken into c.) would require it's own garage d.) insurance would cost loads e.) end up not being used unless going out of town specifically to drive it. There's just not enough room for my personal needs but man if I lived somewhere I could really whip this thing it would be a blast to drive. Would love to take this on the autobahn or on the track but also if I wasn't worried about the cost and all the other stuff above this would be a dream car just to scoot around town in. It's fancy but it's not 'overly' flashy imo. Also this colorway looks dope to me ion know what you all on about.
Where exactly can you put that top speed to use?  I'd rather go with the fastest acceleration.
That car has automatic wipers it’s accessed in the settings on the screen
I have fantasized about the charger since I was fourteen. Dodge just put my dream car on steroids.
$90,000 car and you have to pay extra for Navigation, XM radio.............  Dash and console look cheap..............but yeah, I get it, 797 hp.
Dodge for life. has always been a good reliable vehicle for me and my dad. My 09 challenger rt about to hit 245k no check engine light. never had transmission problems nothing, does has cheap plastic stuff but ehh…
koenigsegg gemera has entered the chat....
You don't see the interior when going forward really fast... eyes on the road...
Hellcat this srt skirrrt skirrrrt
Ford: we made a 1 cylinder quad turbo sedan that makes 100 HP with a bunch of useless crap no one needs and sounds like a weed Wacker Dodge : we jammed a top fuel motor in our daily driver!  Thank you dodge for still being awesome
S class Benz any day over this overpriced charger
Last time I saw Doug drive a hellcat he almost totaled it (white hellcat challenger)
Who needs luxury when you have enough torque to pull 3 F-250’s?
When American RPAB (Raw Power And Brutishness) competes with an ECGCA (Exotic Curve Gobbling Class Act) italian supercar.  - Heya. Wanna go fast in a straight line?  - No, I prefer picking up chicks.
Seen some of his videos and this guy truly doesn't understand why a sport car is missing luxury features.
Where the so called link to the other video in the description?? 🙄
He ruined the video by talking through the whole video instead of letting viewers hear the car's incredible performance.
Ehgtv is totally ripping off this entire video
still an American made garbage piece of s
Considering that the world is full of Lamborghinis, Porsches, Audis, Bugattis, Ferarris, and other exotic vehicles, you have to admit that these Dodge/Chrysler vehicles have become some of the most desirable cars in the world.  4REAL
That's an absolutely insane ride.  And that peanut butter color in the interior is out of this world.  I gotta give Dodge/Chrysler, credit: those are some incredible machines they're making, that they're putting out. But they've got to do better than that dangerous rear wheel drive set up. They're going to have to either come up with a front wheel drive setup or all wheel drive set up and dump the rear will drive set up because it's just too dangerous.  And I don't care for that matt black hood on that beautiful purple/wine color, but it is what it is.  If I owned that car in that particular color,  I'd tell the people at the Dodge dealership that I wanted the hood sanded down and painted purple.  4REAL
Next upgrade 1000 horsepower but no drink holders😂
Ok you're not gonna get crazy tech or flashy interor.Youre gonna get power.Its not a luxury car at the least.
what it lacks in technology it makes up in performance
Getting a Jay Leno vibe from this guy
The actually gander allegedly hammer because part extracellularly paddle over a waggish brace. rabid, thoughtless stomach
The commercial at the start of this video was a summer sale at a dodge dealership. Coincidence? I think not. It’s a sign that I need to go buy a redeye. 1st step: sell a couple organs 😀
Bet IT COULD BEAT A COP CAR!!!!
Hot HOT HOT!!! INSANE..WHO CARES ABOUT THE INTERIOR..I GET IT!!! ONE BAD CAR!!!!!!!
I hate auto wipers
Needs tinted windows 😉
Doug was hilarious in this video, thanks for cracking me up...MORE POWER!!!
Peanut butter guts
Tesla is faster
How can they make something so exciting look so incredibly boring?
damn all these new cars starting to look like matchbox and hot wheels made em
Hell raisin exterior, peanut butter interior. When you want to make everyone peanut butter and jelly of your car.
that purple and peanut butter actually go together well. sorta like a peanut butter/grape jelly sandwich
The back up camera is wide though. Useful for angled parking.
Anyone else catch the cop at 9:55 about two seconds before he stepped on it?
Why would you want adaptive cruise control on a Dodge Hellcat when majority of people most likely won't even use it. I think regular cruise control is good enough for a hellcat and dodge probably does not even seen a purpose in adaptive cruise control on the Hellcat's anyway.
I LOVE YOU OMG  IM GOING TO GET ONE IN DA FUTURE YA HEEARD?
Why is a charger called a hellcat? Don’t know cars that well, just curious.
Body is ugly… the rest is 10 rating..
why?
You pay for the engine
dont be jealoussssssssssss
Awesome sleeper car. I love cars like this as they don’t attract all of the attention that a Lamborghini or Ferrari would but performs as well and at a quarter of the price. And it doesn’t cost 20 grand for a minor repair
Moooooooo pooowwwwerrrraa baby 😂💯
I feel like its price is that fucking engine/motor, but yeah def not worth a full 90k imo, since all it takes is about 10k to really go just as fast, if not faster than it
What is price of indian money
Add awd to get all that power down
Wow the USA really have to step up their game in interieur and exterieur if they want to build decent cars in the future. They look like toys compared to german / european cars.
The cheapest latch dodge could find 🤣🤣🤣
The 2018 srt hellcat is a faster car bro by 1 mph
🥰💏
No Burnout????
very nice  i like these things.
I wonder why dodge hasn't made an AWD version.
and a plaid model s tesla will pass it like its standing still. so much for being the fastest eh?
first he said it hs 800hp, then he said it has 797 lol
Just for the record all late model charges and challengers come dealer equipped with a douchebag position directly behind the steering wheel congratulations
Man one day I’ll have this car 😩
Peanut Butter & Jelly Helly 😋
That’s that peanut butter jelly 💋
This car is not even faster than a M5, how is it the faster sedan in the world?
INSIDE PEANUT 🥜  BUTTER, OUTSIDE JELLY 🍇
sorry worst review ever
5 months later and Im seeing Doug in a Dodge acting kinda weird…
trash car
It is definitely not worth $87.000...
Never heard of BMW's and AMG's...?
its not the worlds fastest sedan, it does 0-60 3.5 and quarter mile in 10.6. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMp1x3td16I the bmw m5 comp does 0-60 in 2.8 and thats tested and quarter mile in 10.24 .
The people who buy these cars are dummies that crash them, doing donuts, take overs, drug dealers, and people who are compensating for you know what. Who spends 90k on this trash when you can be luxury with performance? Answer? Low IQ people.
I’m gonna buy this right here
Not impressed by its appearance.
I mean "performance and basically nothing else"  Still has leather, Harmon Kardon audio, best infotainment system, Power seats, four doors, heated steering wheel ;), 8 speed transmission, active exhaust, HID headlights, led tailights, an excellent backup camera (despite what you say), blindspot monitoring, srt performance pages, adjustable suspension, adjustable steering, absolutelymassive brakes with 6 piston brembos... I mean it doesn't have the useless tech car makers put in to justify increasing the price but...   I am surprised it doesn't have adaptive cruise because that was an option on my scat pack, maybe something to do with the front grille and needing cooling?  Edit: yes, I'm correct it's due to cooling needed. That's why no adaptive cruise.
I've never heard anyone complain about a door opening too far before lol.
It's as ugly as Trump
when the flying spur is faster💀
Why did it get a 9/10 on acceleration?...
This is My all time favourite car 🤩🤩😍😍😘😘
man i love this car
911 still beat the shit out of this boat all day
So, if you wanted a comparable price with a better interior but decent performance, what are the options?
I actually really like that the reflectors offset the brake calipers in red. Stupid I know but once I noticed it I couldn't unnotice it 😂
This might be my first car if I get a scholarship for colage
2022 charger hellcat be like.... Demon? Hold my beer....
I don’t know what he’s talking about I love the interior and what 40k car has that good of a interior
Dude, sorry. But I gotta school you again, if the inside is peanut butter 🥜 the outside is purple, YOU HAVE "PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY" THAT WASN'T THAT HARD, MORON🤪🥴
0:10 _"It's the fastest sedan on the planet."_ C'mon Doug, it's not even the 2nd fastest production sedan on the planet.  BMW/Alpina B7 and Bently Flying Spur both beat it.
WOOW fell in love with that color
Doug the type of guy to review his wife's exhaust notes.
Moar Power baby!
will the charger srt hellcat out run a police car
I ride a 150cc yamaha with less than 20 hp. I really should not be watching this video 🙄
I'm holding out for 1000 hp.
Nice houses in that area you drive around in.
Couldn't hit 800 hp could ya?  Weak!
I'll save 15k and take a Giulia QV, thanks.
Soy boys & manly chics would complain about it's carbon footprint, & make some sort of "global warming" bullshit regerences...
Title should say “ in the straight line” cause plenty of sedans go around a track much faster.
he gives off pervert vibes
Let's be honest, a backup camera is really the only camera you need.  If u had any more camera angles you really should start debating why driving lessons are a thing.
The Flying Spur is the fastest sedans pushing the car to 207mph
zzzzztttiiiisssssssss is a Dodge Charger
I literally wouldn't care if it only came with 1 seat and the steering wheel. The supercharger puts a smile on my face everyday, even after 3 years of ownership
The Dodge Charger is like an iPhone SE, $400 for all the power of a $1.5k phone at the cost of not looking as nice
$80-90, 000 and as soon you drive it off the lot, the value dropped to $30,000 or less.
i actually hate auto windshield wipers, useless
brown seats, black interior, purple exterior.... who picked colors? Stevie Wonder?
if only bugatti had stayed with their promise of a sedan
Sv project 8 better
THHHHISSSSSSSSS
Analog gauge's 🤔😏
Redeye. Set. Go!!! #dodge #mopar #chargerSRT
The 2015 Camaro Z/28 was the first car to have 305 front tire
I like the interior
get a bmw instead of that piece of shit lmfao
Funny thing is I've never had an issue closing my charger door
Grand theft auto
Its nice, but I just cant do four door sports cars, I just cant.
This ass hole complaining about the interior.
"literaly mopawa babe" LoL
the best sedan in the world
inside penut butter outside jelly
peanut butter & jelly hellcat
I watch this then look out  my window at my fucking shit box death trap and just wanna cry
I', still waiting for the hellcat red eye smart car it's all engine
It’s better to have less technology than more. You have less shit to worry about when it comes to the computers.
The only dodge id ever buy
Interchiller is cool. Will they ever update the platform?
get a corvette for the money
bro how tf this color is blue it looks gray af to me
Why not 900 hp?
The only thing holding me back from buying one of these , is the interior.    It’s to shit.
Automatic windshield wipers are the biggest waste of electricity i have had to endure, Even more so when it breaks.
Also check the storage compartment in the middle that’s where the USB chargers are
Who wants to drive a Hellcat in cruise control though?
Those are some ugly ass colors though. Orange brake calipers and that purple paint 🤮
Peanut butter and jelly
I recently went from a 16 Wrangler to a used 17 Challanger RT and I gotta say it feels like a luxury car to me between the 2. It has everything I could want including the adaptive cruise control which now I would not ever want a car without lol.
its kinda annoying they limited the demon to 160 mph even though its engine is definitely capable of over 200mph but on the charger they didnt limit anything
I couldnt tell if i was just a normal srt hellcat or this one, but my dad sold a used chevy silverado to him and he just parked his car there and i just couldnt believe i was staring at one of the fastest cars in the world. He had to leave to get the money for the truck, and thats when we both heard it. As soon as he got out of the parking lot he floored it and i swear you can hear that from a mile away
A charger is not a sedan it’s a muscle car
MOPAR!!!
for about a week before it overheats and rattles apart
That color though. Yikes.
wow 797hp and it only goes 203. smh you can go 203 with a 15 year old e60 M5 with a tune and 300 less hp
Doug: “Rear camera quality and quantity is lacking, no adaptive cruise, no wireless phone charger, no auto wipers... these are things in every modern car”  Me: “since when were these things in any modern car?”     Edit: obviously I knew these things existed in modern cars, but I really have never had or seen them, i thought they were very new that were kind of experiments from their manufacturers
american car is garbage
BLACKS MEXICANS AND NATIVE AMERICANS AND JAMAICANS 12 tribes of Israel we are God chosen people the real Hebrew Israelites of the Bible research
im glad they didnt name it the hellcat pink-eye.
Thissss
Interior looks like the 90s. I'll pass
all the hood niggas got this
That is Lie Doug, The fastest Sedan in the World is 2020 and 2021 Bentley Flying Spur top speed 207mph.  Useless you meant to say Fastest Sedan in America.  Do your homework before posting, You Failed the basics so i'm deducting a Doug Score lol
It's ugly as hell. Not for me.
Take it on a real closed circuit and race it against any European sports car. Just going straight is meaningless
The world's fastest sedan is PB&J colored! 'Murica!
What everyone hates to admit is that dodge is the only one of the big three that is making actual muscle cars. I love cameros and mustangs but they are not muscle cars anymore. They are track cars
Where can I buy one?
And the heaviest!!! It only weight 6 tons
Sedan?  It's a minivan for crying out loud. All it's missing is the gearshift in the steering column.
2025 Dodge Charger SRT Lucifer 1197hp starting at $69,690, 2025 Dodge Charger SRT Lucifer Red Eye 1297hp starting at $79,790, same body same interior but a red Lucifer badge
Why does this car remind me of a Pb&J
When will see a review of the Dodge Challenger super stock?
Doug I have a 392 Charger. People that buy these cars do not care about adaptive cruise automatic wipers and all that other tech shit. It's all about performance sound and the amazing throttle response these cars give. It's how raw it is that makes it fun.
Wonder why he put this on the other channel for?
inside peanut butter, outside jelly!!!
Doug the type of guy to drive with his doors locked
He complaining bout the interior but you paying for the engine at that point of the interior is like that 😂
And the ugliest
Do you guys think that Mercedes will claim the title?
I wish u showed us the blacked out version
It's American as its pb&j color combo.
Brampton, Ontario daily commuter
A 90.000$ plastic bomber, who the hell is buying such a car.
There also one of the fastest cars from the dealership to being a totaled piece of scrap
This car is so fast the extra features  flew off during travel.
I’ve been saying for years that chargers and challengers are trash, no comfort at all, just all engine, that’s weak
Perfect vehicle for mowing down pedestrians and plowing into other cars when some idiot loses control of it during a street race.
$90,000 Ill pass.
Just wish it was all wheel drive👀
I need that charger RT 🔥
All other car companies: We need to make EV's, no one wants gas anymore Dodge: *rails a line of coke of a hookers ass* "Let's make a car with 2,000 HP that gets 2 MPG, spits fire, has race open headers and tires that melt in 1,000 miles!" Everyone: "Shut up and take my money!"
Jesus is coming soon repent and turn to him before it’s too late! He loves you deeply that’s why he died for your sins so that you can be forgiven through repentance and saved through faith in him alone ❤️❤️❤️
These muscle cars handling are the worse in need for speed...regardless of horsepower
Red key please who cares about the windshield wipers
fastest sedan in the world ??? you obviously haven't met my Ford ZX4
One ugly car, tho fast
more poweeerrrrrrrrrr !!!!!!!
That Hellcat Redeye ain’t even a Dodge anymore. It’s a Fiat.
8:20
I have a question I live in a country that everything is expensive also this car Is this car considered as one of the most expensive cars too?  Or people can buy it easily
Insane performance for the dollar.  Would totally dig an R type Hellcat.  By that I mean eliminate the rear seats, nice pair of Recaro's or ? with a 5 point harness.  Offer delete options like radio, spare tire, jack, heck, toss the console and put studly looking shifter with an 8 ball on it sticking right out of the tunnel.  With a peanut butter leather boot  ;-)   Manual of course!
$90k?  It’ll pay for itself after a few bank robberies.
Drinking game - Drink when Doug Says “... The fastest Sedan ...” lol
Great review Plum with da peanut butter guts ..the pullin the door closed by the bottom was low key funny guess it don’t matter with all dat horsepower 🔥
This probably will be in a museum before it reaches 20.000 Miles. Under "Idiocracy" title
What? You open the bonnet & there is no slab of plastic.
Still a piece of junk lmao   Imagine spending that on a dodge lmao
The voracious click immunohistologically nail because blade marginally injure down a second waste. null, ahead queen
World's Powerfulest sedan
9:00 MO POWA BABY
Does this mean the demons not the fastest no more
Tbh all what matters to me is the outside look and the power like he mentions😅
Who cares about the horsepower when it's that hideous looking?
Sorry Doug u wrong about this car it’s not the fastest Sadan the dodge demon is 840 hp and top speed 203 💯🤷🏿‍♂️🤔
Lol, the glove box latch
Youre paying $90,000 for the name brand
Fastest stock sedan
I have automatic wipers in my fully loaded 2016 charger rt 😂😂
Damn what a car ! 😎
Now THAT is exactly what I would've imagined a 2020 American V8 sounding like!
Doug: It has 797HP and 707 ft-lb of torque...It'll run a 10.6 quarter mile...STOCK! 911 Turbo S: That's cute...
It's not the world's fastest sedan
This is for the people who want to go to jail, daily.
UNLIMITED POWAAAA
Shit car with a big engine
If you buy a fararri ore a maclaron with that much power you are going to spend four times as much
Whot dose this twat mean even better how can you better an iconic 69 charger
I love Dodge not bowing down!
8:05 so stupid u really have to manually turn the wipers on
No Tesla will ever be comparable to this beauty!
World of the year "This"
We want more powerrrrrr 🔥
So pathetic. The world's fastest "sedan" what do you really know about cars? In March 2020, Koenigsegg Gemera was presented And it's a sedan! 248 / mph Planet Earth does not just consist of "USA" as you seem to believe! There are a few more countries than the USA on the "planet" This car is developed in Sweden and manufactured in Sweden. Do I dislike cars from the US? I do not think so. One of my cars is a JEEP Liberty 👍   Correctly guessed! I'm Swedish
I am not there for this new interior trend, I don't like those screen to screen solutions. I would pick this car over anything in this price segment. And I would definitely not be bothered by it's colours.
Insert Mercedes Benz Rocket 900.
I was in Florida a few months ago doing 90 in my Range Rover and I had a HellCat Blow past me doing at least 170 or better, Dan near shook my Jeep off the ground. 3 seconds later couldn’t see a thing, the HellCat was gone. Insanely fast.
the coolant matches the cars color 👍👍
Alpina B5: "Hold my Vmax Beer!"
the KPH conversion is the best part of the video, really appreciate that :)
😍
Not stick shift? Not interested
don't think anyone buying this cares about adaptive cruise control
THIS
Do they make some that's convertible?
Dodge is killing it with the interiors in their new trucks. They need to bring that love over to the cars and SUVs
Bruh it looks cheap asf and it’s 90K ? Nah I’ll take a 60K Tesla model 3 Performance instead.
Gorgeous vehicles  the charger hellcats,  love the hell raisin color , great looks and power if u have the money, I have a charger and I agree the doors open too wide you literally are hanging out the car to close the door
waiting on the charger demon
What an ugly car
its like this car was made for me
The idle is music to my ears
Will they make a sedan version of the Demon?
I’d say the car is jelly over peanut butter  It’s a satanic sandwich
for $90k? I was thinking,  pull up strap windows for 22' and remove the electric locks, if I can reach to close the door, I can push\pull the door locks too!!!!
Cadillac Don- Inside Peanut Butter Outside Jelly Granted he was talking about Chevys, but cmon. It’s literally peanut butter and jelly. 😂
I just want a charger bc it looks cool, go fast, and fun to drive
797 horses. What’s up with that, Dodge couldn’t pull another three horsepower out of its ass for an even 800?
You get it hell raisin 🤣🤣💀
So now i realize that DODGE is DADGE as in BADGE but a D
What I don’t like about the charger. Is that it’ looks so basic it’s does not look like a aggressive sport car. But yes the hp is definitely no joke. But the Dodge Charger should work on making this car more aggressive and sporty from the outside.
Why has no one referred to the redeye as the "widow maker"? 🤔 Does Dodge need to take it to 1000hp before it has earned the title!  😈😨👹
I just bought one today and I traded in a Challenger hellcat the redeye feels so much faster. Dodge is crazy.
Who’s here after watching the helicopter chase!!
“Modern era cars” says the “1980s” 😂
MORE POWER ! why no go on the highway and make some pull ?
you are very hilarious bro. love this review.
I got a semi when he hit the throttle.. and I'm not ashamed
Stop bullying..
Reminds me of the plymouth prowler with that cat logo and purple color, it also looks like wario's car with that aggressive look and color.
It has automatically windshield wipers, just as long as you keep your headlights on automatically they kick on.
arches and side looks like an rx8 in a weird way
It's....it's... It's peanut butter jelly time
300,000 dollars?        Ima stick with my 2jz
I don't get the whining! For 90.000 bucks you have a SUPER DUPER COOL ride! It's not exactly a Bentley but it's really cool and good looking!
I really wanna see a 1st gen cr-v review form Doug
Im to the point where I would like to have a GT500 because I think it looks better and is better but the 4doors on the SRT makes me want it and idk what to buy
The problem is it’s a Dodge.
Complains there’s no Cruise control, it’s literally a performance car not a mom van
I’m not a dodge fan! Never have been. That being said this car looks and sounds fucking amazing.
The color choices are fine, it's the pb&j car
all the money went into the engines performance lol
I get it this car preforms!
What about the giulia gta?
I actually kinda like the color combo
Def will break down on you within 6 months hahaha
5:17 ah yes the PB and J charger, my favorite🤩
How to die faster 101
Maybe the fastest sedan made by Dodge, but it's definitely not the fastest sedan in the world... (BMW M5 Competition, Mercedes E63s, Porsche Panamera Turbo S,...)
My dream car and that color is sick .....👌💪👍
Dodge engineered the doors to open wide for fat people
90k 100k and I get cheap insides 🤦🏽‍♀️ no thanks
I'm sorry Doug, that color combination is awesome, probably my favorite
Dodge big wigs: we need a really fast super car  Dodge engineers: lmao
buy a laptop if you need screens :)))
What about the dodge demon? Isn't that a faster sedan???
Well Doug it’s a sport car not a luxury sedan
Aaand its is part of (hemi engine everything)
Charger hellcat redeye:"I am the fastest sedan in the world!" p100d said:"really?"
If this guy could not move his hands, would he still be able to talk? Just wondering.
I'm thinking about getting the SP wide body 🤔
IN THE HOOD WE CALL THAT COLOR COMBO PEANUT BUTTER & JELLY.
Peanut butter jelly whip
Que tremendo coche!!!! Me encanta tu canal y tus videos. Acabo de subir un video con el nuevo TRX. Me impresionó. Saludos!

Every cop dream car 😭
$90K for a very fast beer can.
THTHTHTHTHTHTHTHIISSSSSSSS
Oh shit that sound so good🥵🥵🥵🥵
Chargers and challengers have cruise control and all that but it's a specific option that's only on some of em
I Only rent them.
i dint know this was more doug
First time I see a video of yours man. I love your excitement. The part you described the color lol hell raising 😂

Bro audi rs 7 is also fastest car
thats not a redeye its just a hellcat
Why does this guy sound like the purple dude from home
Dodge in 3021: we present you the charger hellcat purple eye with 120liter v8 with 6000hp and 6281 pound feet of torque
YuuY
The door opening too far isn’t a issue if you get in and out of the car by climbing through the window like you’re supposed to.
Insanity...should've made this a mid engine muscle car.... damn...think about that shit.
It's a race car not a luxury car. You pay for the muscle and race aspect not the luxury corks and screws. That's just extra weight with all the whistles and bells . MORE POWER!!!!!
I like cars for nice interiors not for the power since you can’t drive it as fast as it goes so not the car for me
Inside peanut butta outside jellllllyyyyy - Juicy J
Im sorry bro but that is the most ugly dodge I've ever seen
A video that’s less than 40mins yippee 👏🏽 👏🏽
This car sucks and for 87k who would ever buy this ?
Think I'll go luxury this time. Cadillac ct6
I'm in love.
The only thing dodge knows is too put powerful engines in everything
Chrysler takes the Mitsubishi Evo approach with all HellCats.  Make the performance high enough that you don't care about anything else.
Can't believe my wife is actually okay with me getting this...
That exhaust sounds amazing
Doug it’s called peanut butter and jelly
This.......is an ugly ass charger
That's Dodge for you......cheap low quality.
I like how the fluid in the engine bay matches the color of the car
I owned a charger scat pack and it’s built quality is shit. The inside of the car looks like a 2003 Chevy cavalier. Great exhaust note. Hard to get traction with all that power. Car does not handle well, unless you have the wide body. All said and done, this car is still bad ass.
aaand my 3,000 dollar built 94 civic would still take it to gapplebees.
And it's a automatic😷
BMW m5 is a faster sedan.
The model is OLD and the color is UGLY! They need to remodel the charger big time! Its plan crazy to place more horse power for what reason it not like you going to race it on everyday driving! Drink gas like mad!
Could it beat the model s?
fastest sedan in existence   doug: PEANUT BUTTER INTERIOR
Follow my TikTok @lukapalot 800 ? 🖤
800hp WHO DA HELL CARES ABOUT THE COLOUR
Y’all in the US can’t use the full horsepower 🤣🤣
It's fast
No adaptive Cruise Control? No worries everyone is gonna be behind you anyway you won't need it.
Q see
Interior 💀😑😑👎👎👎
Can someone make the caption make sense for me? “Fastest sedan” ? Like wtf lol
It looks like a Chrysler 300
gggghhhiiisss is a Dodge Charger ........!!!!!
couple tunes on the golf R will beat it
"Fastest saden in the world" isn't that the BMW M5 competition? (which gets a 10 for acceleration where as this gets a 9).
Faster than Audi RS7?
Dodge don't care about those cheap buttons, all the money goes straight to more powah babey
What about teala
This clown never drives these cars, and never took this  800 hp car more than 40 mph...driving only a few minutes...how do these shit videos get all these viewers.......
2021 Cadillac escalade 70,000 with 400hp or a sedan with 800hp for the same price
Dodge Hellcat in 2035: 1700 DP (Dragon Power)
What about Challenger srt hellcat xr? It has 888hp and 999nM.
THE PEOPLE AT DODGE DESIGNED THE DOOR TO OPEN ALL THE WAY SO BIG PEOPLE CAN GET IN EASIER
Elon Musk reads the headline. Can we make a blue eye?
and its the same body as those police cars
Damn imagine the cops with this 😳
Ima b late for work.. I gotta clock in 15 min.. And I'm 40 min away from work.. Red Eye Hellcat 2021: Hold my beer..
Idk lol
i wish the Scat Packs could get this hood.. i mean the Challengers do, so doesn't make sense
Faster than E63///AMG
inside peanut butter.. for when you shit yourself rippin it
This interior was created by a guy without a mother and a wife and a daughter and a grandmother and a aunty and a sister.
Dodge makes some ugly cars man
$85K starting for a Fiat, who should have thunk it.
203 mph? not too much faster than the 2018 charger srt hellcat, only 2 mph difference
dodge chargers are for people with erectile disfunction
If you were in the Charlotte area I would have hoped you would have took it round 485
Exterior: Purple Aka Grape Jelly  Interior: Peanut butter  Cue song: it's peanut butter jelly time 🥜🍇💃🕺
That colour is disgusting ....... not in a cool way wtf who would buy that?
hearing a hellcat called a sedan just doesn’t sound right to me for some reason, just doesn’t sit right
Damn. I want one but the way my account set up.....hopefully one day 😂🤦🏽‍♂️
Those fenders are uuugggly looks like a old Ford focus fender
SRT with no mileage  SRT it's not silent
Dimitri from cobra Kai? Is that you?
Coolant was the same colour as the car under the hood 😱
That supercharger whine is music to my ears 😌
Automatic 😞
The peanut better n jelly effect
This car looks like its a 2012 model, rather then a 2021. Cheap materials everywhere and a dated interior haha!
The backup camper is for people who can’t back up I’m sorry dodge is a drivers car if you need a back up camera to back up your car you shouldn’t buy a dodge
It's not the fastest sedan by a long shot... Not even the fastest american car. The Cadillac CT6-V is even faster
It’s not a real charger. Chargers have Two doors, which would probably make it faster and not so much like a family car. Call it Dodge Stupid but that’s not a Charger.
A stinger would smoke it
He gotta be a ford guy hes ripping mopar,
An all wheel drive version should be in the lineup.
Is this Scotty Kilmer son
You said a push button glove box was “over kill” in a car well the CTS-V has it and you did a review on it soooo... 🌚
The electronics in this don’t match any foreign car. Only let down. Interior weak. Come it’s 2021. Looks cheap man
Why would anyone buy that car lmao, looks cheap asf when it costs a lot. I would rather have an bmw or Audi
This car is Trash and Dodge is trash to
Am I the only one that still forgets the diff between a Charger & Challenger when they pass by ....
100% MAGA CAR
Fun Fact: the "Redeye" signature on Dodge cars means the car is possessed by the "Demon" line of muscle cars they no longer produce anymore, but it uses most of the same parts
🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
on the lot $80,000  trade it on okay ... we can give you bout $6,000 for it , $8,000 the most
bro i hope 1 year they update the interior frfr .. literally the dumbest thing ever ... like that standard radio is stupid
Now that's a muscle car!
Luckily will last 20k miles.
It’s not the fastest sedan in the world, the Bentley Flying Spur goes 207 mph which 5 mph faster that Charger Red Eye
Audi rs6 is not this 5000 hp crap
But every other 80grand car dosent have one thing which only dodge gives and it's 800Hp and the feel of its power
Walter White has entered the chat*
Might be the fastest std manufacturing 4 door but Brabus has faster cars
Fast is just one part of performance. Doug come to philly.  Lincoln drive, 476, or Kelly drive.
Just screen shot that interior.  And i always remember thats that cheap as dodge people love to use in automatic and mash the gas🙄 horrible. Yes..yes......im hating. But its a car. So lol
Bro...yall...have any of u sat in one.???? ITS FUCKING WACK AND LONG WITH NO SPACE IN THE REAR. ....I have never seen this car kill the street. Just straight aways. Dodge also horribblleeeeeee quality 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ its a fucking dodge i am so lost at the glamour to this dated designed car.
yeah but scotty's 94 celica is more reliable and it's still pretty zippy
90k for engine only, the rest is shit plastic. For that price you can buy the new M5 and destroy any car.
Why does he talk like that?
What you said about the technology in the Charger is so true, I wanted to buy a Hellraisin GT just the V6 model as I am coming off of my hot hatch days and don't need "the fastest car" anymore and I wanted the premium stereo and the adaptive cruise control packages. The salesperson told me, we almost NEVER add the technology package onto these GT chargers because most buyers who want a charger but don't want to pony up the extra $10 grand for the v8 engine don't care about those features, they either don't have any money for accessory packages at all or they want the handling package which is stiffer springs and the big painted Brembos. I would have had to special order one... $40k with no guarantee of end of year dealer incentives and no leverage to get a good trade in for my Focus ST? Nah. But while looking for a used Fusion Sport I found a used Lincoln MKZ 3.0T for like $27k with ALL the options.
@8:30.....that's it, I'm convinced Doug is just Jay Leno deepfaced.
My 2016 Challenger has auto wipers ..  so that seems odd? Center console looks almost identical otherwise.
People buy them for the power but it needs a new interior and should sell in other colors grey , black , white get old need to sell out as red , blue more eye catching colors
THHHHHHISSSS.
5:18 Ah, yes. The peanut butter and jelly sedan
I call it PBJ
*I think Tesla can beat it.* "Dodge officially launches its 2020 Charger SRT Hellcat Widebody on Thursday, calling it the “most powerful and fastest mass-produced sedan in the world.” Dodge says its latest muscle car can hit 60 in just 3.6 seconds and top out at 196 mph." *However, the Tesla Roadster is faster.* ​The quickest car in the world, with record-setting acceleration, range and performance. See the specs: Base Specs below:   https://www.tesla.com/roadster *Acceleration 0-60 mph = 1.9 sec*  Acceleration 0-100 mph = 4.2 sec Acceleration 1/4 mile 8.8 sec *Top Speed = Over 250 mph*
FALSE: Tesla P100D ludicrous is the worlds fastest Sedan. 1.9 0-60 Then the BMW M5 is also faster than this with a 2.7 0-60
Just bought a charger scat pack. That thing scares me with “only” 485hp. Can’t imagine what the hellcats feel like!
Getting  it
Porsche Panamera: Ze German engineering iz ze best!  Hellcat Redeye: *Chuckles in 800 buff horses*
POOOOOOWER
but it isnt an ORdinary charger, This one comes in the worst color they offer
Nice but if I am going to spend that kind of money I would buy the exorcist Camaro from the factory with over a thousand horsepower plus I'm a Chevy man
Good, but simply useless in the real world.
This is stupid.  Ugly, cheaply made, a $25,000 car with a big motor.  Get an E63 and go to Renntech to jack it to 773hp/778tq.  Better in every single way possible.
It isn’t the fastest to 60, fastest to a quarter mile, nor does it have the highest top speed for a sedan.
Well you dont get a muscle car for luxury
i'd rock it
Doug: *laughs sarcastically*  Also Doug: "Actually, I do kinda find that funny."
if I was buying a red eye i would care less about adaptive cruise control...  get a bmw or Mercedes if you want bells and whistles   as long as its dot legal, the rest is gravy
Great review. When you review the 850 HP twin turbo or whatever those maniacs put out next, after you get your concealed/carry permit for the key, could you spend a little more time on the mirrors?  (I suspect these will be the most commonly used accessory, immediately after the accelerator... or gas pedal... the Chernobyl footrest... Whatever Dodge decides to call it).
Man i want one so bad
the interior is shameful.
I don’t know why they have to say SRT HellCat RedEye like wtf just say redeye or hellcat shit they should have called it a hell kitty or demon cat idk
Are ya whining, son?
beep, beep, beep, GONE!!!!!!!
The exterior design is so not muscle car.. Fix it dodge, ugly ass car
my $23k motorcycle has stock carbon fiber nose and fairings. Please tell me the dash on this Hellcat is actual carbon fiber, for $90k it better be
I don't even know what to say. . basically if someone wants this car and can afford it with the insurance then it is what it is..  Just don't get a purple exterior with a peanut butter looking terra-cotta interior. Lol
A good built interior and exterior... for a 90s car!!
Wouldn't the Bentley Flying Spur be slightly faster at 207mph?
In defense the automatic wipers are in the Unconnect settings
It lacks a clean luxurious appeal. The interior is ugly. It gives off masculinity.
Lovely car tho
The color combo is eww
Finally a Chrysler product that will break twice a day rather than once a day! Fix it Again Tony LOL
Really sucks when someone backs into you on the side panel and cant open the door all the way. I wish I had to worry about my door opening too far
Anybody with Charger or 300 have delaminating door panels that they can't get replaced because they're backordered under September 2021? Seriously FCA ? You sell a $71k Hellcat that's literally coming apart and you can't replace my door panel on my 2016 with 31k on the odometer? Not to mention the the fake chrome bezel coming apart around the cup holders that sliced my finger open spewing blood everywhere!!! No wonder there's a class action lawsuit from unhappy Dodge owners!!!🤬 Let me hear if you're having any of these issues?
I've honestly never understood the Charger interior design. for a car that can range from $30k up to $60k or more they don't put any effort hardly that they put into the Ram. For a Ram base model 1500 it is as bare bones as it gets. All the way up to a limited and it feels like you're driving a extreme luxury pickup. But for charger they just don't put the effort into the interior that i'd like to see. They desperately need a redesign for it, or at least give the options available to those willing to spend the extra money.
It’s called peanut butter and jelly bro, get ur swag up a bit
Peanut butter and jelly is the best color combo ever😎💯
Meeeowwwww! Love this car 😈
Waht is name the color
I'd still pick a 1969 Daytona over this. My opinion,  pretty,  quick, and modern. But I'd pick a 1969 Daytona
8:50 MOOO POWAH BABY
Jay Leno clone?
You're literally spending 90 gs on an engine.
Yall babies i swear I like the color combo
Fastest but not the quickest 😭
The door opens that wide for the police
Not a fan of the 4 door Charger. I wish they brought back the old style Charger like they did the Challenger.
2050: This is a dodge charger DEMON with  2500hp And it will do 310mph
I wanted to see more of the car.. he is talking way too much..
Describing all the modern features this car lacks...and I have literally never had a single one of them in any car I've ever owned. lol...
I brought a 2020 Maxima Plat, I am having a kid and needed a kid friendly car compared to my acura 2012 TL. So my friend was like why you didn't go for the new or a 2018 hell cat and I told him this.  @ 11:40 I would loose my life fucking with this car because I would want to race the whole world including the cops.
I thought it would of been so cool if I came up with the idea of calling it peanut butter and jelly but I have already been beated... =(
Mo powah babeh
Doug would shit his pants 5 minutes into bike life
Wonder when the Jeep compass srt hellcat will come out
I want get the salesman go for the test run do 190+ on the test drive 🤣🤣 on public road see if I want buy it or not
The Tesla p1000 is the fastest sedan now lol
car has power n thats it...damn kia soul has better looking interior. so many chargers on the street and 90k car definitely should be showing standing on different zone from regular chargers. pretty much goes to every american made car.
Horsepower is actually 797,
WE...NEED...MORE...POWER!!!
For right, the worlds fastest Sedan is the Dodge Charger Redeye &(!) The Alfa Romeo GIULIA QV ("QV' means "🍀" and in words "Quafrfoglio Verde") and both Sedans has something special; Both are the worlds fastest Sedans ever built. Both are Made by FCA. Both stands for their own Design with the eyes of the History of both automakers. The Charger uses the best what America brought out in Automobil History; the V8! And the GIULIA QV uses the best what Alfa Romeo Stands for; finest Engine designes, especially in Alfa Romeo's History the "ARESE" or also called "BUSSO V6" Engine Series, designed by Giuseppe Busso back in the days. This ARESE V6 made by Alfa Romeo got the Titel of "the best gasoline powered V6 engine ever designed and Made". And that's really really true! Because it's Not only an Engine Series that made so much more performance than any Data paper could tell you, it is also an Engine what could last forever, because the Special Motorsport Design with the cylinder liners made of hardened Steel sits in "Open Deck Design" in an aluminum alloy Block and are interchangable. These V6 could really last forever and in the later/90s 24Valve Versions they Made over 7.300 rpm Out of the Box. And over 200.000mls without any Problems are  quiet ordinary and not rare. The Sounds of the Busso ist so much different to any other V6 or engine Series and ist so amazing that the words are true, that EVERY real Auto Enthusiast should to own an Alfa Romeo, especially with a Busso V6 under the Hood. And the new GIULIA ist using These charakteristic Feature/s like the engine what Made that automaker so iconic, Like it is also the same about the Dodge Charger Redeye... This are the Things real Car Guys Love!!! :)
It lacks stuff from my old 2005 300c. Thats weird
I'd like to see you review a 2008 Dodge Magnum srt8
Raisin Hell!🤣😂😅, love it!
I like the PB' N J color scheme.
90 K for a really fast trashcan..
Now somebody mod it to be AWD...
your not buying the looks of the car, your buying the power of the car
That car is a waste of money unless ur just going to race it...i had 2010 charger that was crap was in a small fender bender and my car folded like a tin can also not reliable at all but i liked the so i got a 2018 challenger red eye and it also was garbage they good for only looks...cheaply made material then when i went to trade in they didnt want to give me hardley anything ..and all i kept hearing was how the loose their value super quick..the one dealer even told me if u get a charger prepare to keep it as a collector's car because it wont be worth ish in a few years...never again will i get one..i have a 16 mustang gt and i love it none of the issues i had with the dodge's...and my insurance is cheaper which that did surprise me...🙄..🤛🏾peace out..
Bro missed a perfect chance to say “today I’ll be driving this peanut butter jelly charger hellcat”
Brakes look like they're lacking even for a 400 hp car.
yeah tech specs are great, too bad it's the ugliest car on the road.
good engine bad car.
Honda flexing say it’s type r is the fast sedan in the American market I just looked it up 169mph hellcat 200 wooo fuck that 90k you tripping I’ll pay for speed tho no cap still maybe be happy wt something else
Is this a money pit after like 8-10 years????
I’ll take the 2020 Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat Daytona 50th Anniversary WideBody instead.
Scotty kilmer begs to differ
I thought the Demon was the fastest? Yeah, 840 bhp
انا ضايع عند الأجانب هل يوجد عربي يساعدني 😂😂😂😂
Curious how close the color Hellraisin is to Plum Crazy Purple.
The ultimately, most ignorant car buyer on the planet
Where does he intend to drive a motor vehicle capable of 220 with 800 hp or is this his way of compensating for inadequacies both mental and physical?
I read this as “The Dodge Charger Hellcat Red Eye is the first sedan”
Saying fastest car on planet but never mentioned 0 to 60 time
purple drank
Who said Sedans are dead just make em faster 😄
Why would you need automatic wipers if you live in Las Vegas or adaptive c.c.? Your buying 800 h.p. not useless accessories...
Is it "green"?  Yeah look at the green belt.
Regardless of the performance, Chrysler makes lemons
THISSSSSSS
Don't mind doug..  just raking in 1M views on his SECOND channel
thats peanut butter and jelly fire combination 🤣❤️
Maybe its the same people who voted for trump , just destroy the envoriment
It’s literally just a pb&j
If cars were women this would be Marylyn Monroe.  Is that a CIA talking point?  Asking for a friend.
It’s called inside peanut butter outside jelly
Time to send your transmission to the fiery pits of hell
It’s like PB&J
Cops: This should absolutely be Illegalized! I mean we can't pull over that! I MEAN LOOK AT THAT! LOOK AT IT!
It's a race car not a commuter
every molar fan gangsta til they find out who owns them
It's fast but so damn ugly
Hahahahaha the hood scoop doesn’t do shit for the power lol
... and it looks shity
This horsepower war will inevitably end up with people not knowing how to drive killing themselves lol
I owe you a 10 second car.
That car is a death trap. Buy one and your kid could sneak out at night take it and wreck it not realizing if you step on the gas you lose control easily.
The best car ever🚘
This is ugly
The dodge demon has a larger scoop, jeez
Peanut butter and jelly smh Doug
Inside peanut butter outside jelly Doug.... come on get hip
Still holding out for the Neon Hellcat! : )
kilometers per hours is - kmh, not kph
Notice how Doug didn’t open full throttle after what happened when he drove street speed 717s Hellcat a few years back😂
Instead of adding 100mph they take your headphone jack but u still gon buy it😭💯
Never realized how annoying dudes voice is 😳
I have photos with me and the Challenger Red Eye... I'm a manager at a Dodge dealership ....
Buy me one pls<3
Why is it called Charger if it needs gas to run
when there's a bee 0:00
forget buying the car, I probably couldn't afford to replace the tires!
Peanutbutter inside outside jelly. Sounds right to me🤷🏾‍♂️
WOW nice!
already looks outdated.
Hahaha Yes, people do have an idea about Dodge Chargers in Charlotte NC
Is it faster than the Bentley Flying Spur? Top speed - I accept it might out-accelerate the W12.
Speed limit is still 70 MPH....I’ll buy a used charger for $6500. And put a stupid badge on it, call it the............hell spawn satan demon red clit.  People will hate me for douching around the town at every stop light and save myself even $100,000 in the process
touching on your interior rant on the charger, i have the 2006 model. i'm a pretty big mopar guy. the 2006 charger has too much technology. all it needs is a seat, a gear shifter, a steering wheel, and pedals. if chrysler did away with all of the fluff of that 2021 model it could have 1500 horses :D
Why the hell would I or anyone waste their cash on an #ICEVehicle given the short time they have left on the roads. I suppose I can't understand why Car companies are still pumping out #ICEVehicles other than the pursuit of $$$$ #Profit. Good call outs on the lack of features
Hey Doug can you review an European car? Something like a DS/Citroen? That would be fun!
if youre saying a seller will get the most money at cars and bids that means the buyer will end up paying more if they chose to go on your site.
the fastest sedan on the planet? I remember a gutted tesla sedan destroyed a few hellcats.
Great, now there's no excuse to be late to work. LMAO
drove this car today and it sounded even better in person
Called the Redeye cause you need to be an asshole to buy this beast
finally, you do a car and not some bs Kia/hyundai
I wouldn't ever pay 90k for that cheap built pos car.
I'm sorry no matter what you do with a charger their ugly af and is literally the definition of a box on wheels.
Jajajaja you just buying the engine,transmission, tires and rims..for that price👎👎👎👎
The ugliest cars ever made.. built cheap all you pay is for the engine even that is a gas guzzler compared to other v8s
203 mph,and most of states 65mph max😂😂😂😂people needs  to go to the Autobahn in Germany. No speed limit..in usa👎👎👎👎💩💩💩💩💩💩
Dodge is so far out in front of everyone else with affordable comfortable ridiculous asphalt crushing power!!!
Cool looking car, and a great price for that much power.  However, anything over 500 hp with a front engine rear wheel drive is simply a waste.  There is no way you can get the power to the ground unless you are running slicks on a drag strip.  I have a 500 hp SL 55 and just putting more power to the rear wheels just means your traction control turns on sooner.  Make it all wheel drive and then you have something, like the Trackhawk:)
A shame the car's ugly. 🤷
*Laughs in a stage 3 straight piped v10 e60*
The fastest car in the world... is a car that isn’t yours
How is this monster on gas tho
Fastest        In a straight line
Purple w/peanut butter interior,no peanut butter and jelly joke?
Great car but I wanna smack the flip out of whoever told Chrysler that's supposed to be a wide body
Love Dodge. The brand that doesn't give a shit about the green deal, and continues to put out the most badass vehicles of our age.
Waiting for the Teslatards to show up with their embarassing 160mph top speed 😊 but but but MY ELECTRIC SHOPPING CART IS FASTER TO 98MPH
still wont beat a tesla off the line lol
Didn't bother giving it a normal dougscore, just went straight with the final score. That's what this car is worth
It's uptown in Charlotte.... Not downtown
MORE POWER BITCH!!!
HONESTLY, dodge has fckdup the front and back looks with this " fish lips" shet. older looks were so aggressive and awesome btw.
0:35 Imagine no one bids on the raptor and you win it for $1000? 🤣
The Porsche panamera turbo s can beat it its top speed is 225
I live close to a military base and I hate every single person who drives a charger.
the hellcats, my dream
" NO WIRELESS CHARGER " IN A HELLCAT WHO KNEW

Color combo is actually called pb&j😂
Grab the door ass ur getting in
Heyyyyyyyy!! He's in my City!!! We love you here in Charlotte Doug!!!!
Dodge 2030: 8K Resolution...I mean 8K horsepower
Doug! Down here in the south, we call those colors peanut butter and jelly sir. 😂😂😂
8:50 Doug's version of MO POWAAA!!!
This is a lie
Вот это я понимаю, отечественный производитель, не то что Лада, с моторчиком от мотоцикла.
The daily step-grandmother electronically reach because smell jelly memorise like a stupendous croissant. grumpy, political pea
what was the 0 to 60?
Did he just say 800 rwhp and over 180 on the dash 😳
Tesla: hold my açaí
It is still a Dodge...
The interior is so ugly
Dodge = crap.
Correction, this interior isn’t from a $40k car, but more a $19k car!
I didn’t even know there were automatic windshield wipers- I’m that broke
Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat Redeye SSJ2 Xtreme Type R Sport Kaioken Times 10 NUT BUSTER 2020 BLACKED Autobots Rollout Headass Edition.
You, sir... are Jay Leno reincarnated. Which is impressive, considering he's still alive.
This thing looks insane.
Who are they advertising this to, all those millions of stay at home dad's working from home that don't need a car?
It's not the FASTEST Sedan in EVERY variable. Tesla still takes it by a hair on the quarter mile.
sort of surprised the car is running on p zeros as opposed to michelin pilot sport 4's at a minimum
“fastest sedan in the world”.. tesla laughing at this video.
8:50 more powah babeh
This thing despite its high power numbers is slower then the German Power Sedans.... An M5 C oder Panmera TS blows that stupid thing out of the water faster then you can say "DOHC"
For some reason I had a thought that he was going to compare that to a Ferrari F40 before the video started I was kinda correct
remember last time doug ?
I’d love one in Australia.
The interior is what ruins this car
Who Would Not LikeTo Buy A Car That Has More Torque But The Same HP As A Lambo Aventador SVJ at 1/5th Of The Price
whole world in 20 years: we are all now electric, except one.....  dodge: WE ARE UNVEILING OUR 3000HP MINIVAN
Internet rumor mill saying the 2022 Mustang V8 will be a Godzilla-downsized 6.8L based on the 7.3L F-series gasser. That would be an aluminum pushrod 2V modern V8 in a much lighter car body than this Charger, more displacement by over 1/2L, and as usual with Mustangs there's a ridiculously large aftermarket with performance parts and tuning. Dodge is just milking this old Mercedes chassis until the end comes. I think that end is soon. They'll be surpassed in value AND power/performance soon by competition.
now i want to see this outrun a helicopter
I officially fun this car, the PB and J car.
My biggest gripe with dodge is the lack of attention for the interiors. Absolutely sad they can’t figure it out. Because the engine and outside is solid.
the charger didn't go with cosmetics and cameras etc, all the money went under the hood
Make mine a 1968 model year R/T 440 cherry red cragar mags and cherry bomb dual exhaust and you got a deal!
They need to make an all wheel drive version
If you're running 10's with all that money and power... can you even enter this without a roll cage??
According to Jeremy Clarkson,  the Fastest Car in the World is a Rental.
is it crazy?
Totoya Corolla more reliable then this
the gt 63s is about 10x time faster at drag race
THHIISSSS...
Dude... I mean, when you buy a car with 800 horsepower, you shouldn't give a fuck about door opening angle... Really who cares?
What about Porsche Panamera?
How tall is this guy?
As Doug was naming off the things missing in the Charger's interior, I kept saying to myself "I don't need that".
Sedan.....sedan.....sedan.....4 door...4 door....
mustang owners getting cut af
Isn't the new Bentley Flying Spur the fastest sedan in the world at 207 mph?
That's My Car
I love that Car and color honestly
Фрик-язык дАддж чОрджер...
With this money I will look for a GTR 😊
Between the red eye wide body and the 05-06  w215 CL65 V12 AMG, which one you think pulls stronger ? Being that the CL also has over 700 ft lbs tq ?
Being the fastest is nothing to brag about engineering wise. Being fast, handling corners and being dependable all in one mix is the hardest combo to achieve.
TO BAD ITS A FIAT-CHRYSLER  CRAPBOX
I've driven them all and in my opinion $90k plus insurance is fucking insane for any dodge or ford period! All that power will never get put down without the right setup. I say search the junk yards for totaled hellcats and boom! If the engine is good you got a powerplant for another car minus the 90k.
Almost $90k for a Dodge. "A fool and his money...." The specs are impressive, no doubt, and if we in the States had Autobahn type no speed limits, maybe it'd be worth a thinking about, but as it stand the specs are pointless. The E Class AMG starts at $85k.... an actual quality vehicle. I don't know what this car's intended market is. I'd be interested in seeing sales figures.
Doug,  I couldn't help but notice you didn't put it in track mode. :-)
People that buy these aren't concerned about cheap plastic interiors. If you want some chrome plated plastic and a door sill that tells you what kind of car you bought buy a damn cadillac.
Wow nice car I wonder how many morons will wrap it around a tree or a poll because its simply to fast for mear mortals yes like my self I have driven my neighbors Demon 😈 and its stupid fast He has a 2019 R1 and we raced them the car beat the bike and both of us can ride just fine . & we switched the bike and the car and the result was the same the interior is a joke for that price point sorry but I think I would take a C8 yea that charger can beat me but toss a blower on the C8 and things get a little more interesting not to mention the inside of the vett is like being in a space ship compared to a well cheepo plastic Dodge .you think they would toss in some carbon fiber and wood trim maybe ????
Lol I don’t give damn about a wireless charger😂 I didn’t even know people did that for cars
a speedboat
What about a Bentley flying spur?
looks like a god damn camry lmao
"Thissss, is the 2022 Doge Charger Red Rocket."   Such quirks.  Such features.    Peanut butter.
This is one of the examples where production engines have hit their peak. Bask in the glory. I'll miss them dearly.
Just subscribed
Omg. I want
Hold on holden gtsr w1????? I wanna see that up against this yeah it’s discontinued Chevy ss that came stock with a ls9 not many people now about it
I wouldn’t have guessed that’s the charger would be the fastes sedan
I have a regular Charger Hellcat. I couldn’t imagine the car being any larger...but here we are.
Porsche Tycan Turbo S 10.37/130mph 1.5 60'. 4 door sedan.⚡electric power....
9:59 🤪🤣😂
this guy is knowledgeable but his hand gestures are so annoying.
Sedan? Pls tell that to my insurance cuz these rates are crazy
Dislikes are Ford and Chevy owners.
You don’t buy one of these for silly things like “amenities”. You buy one of these so your wife can hear you coming from a county away and know to get that ass ready for Big Poppa!
i can feel the 4 out of 10 even i didn't finish the vid
Shhhhuuut UUPP
You are the reason for warning labels on lawn mowers.
Doug...I would take your man card if you had one.
The interior is extremely cheap. Youre basically paying for the engine.
I love this car and appreciate its capability, but dodge is really starting to bore me we need a new charger,challenger line up.
World's Fastest Sedan... until the first turn 😂
Dodge reality listen to their customers.
No it’s not even close to the Gemera
This dude is dramatic, n all those things he point out isn’t necessary. Makes you a lazy unAlert driver
Just don't try to turn in it
Yeah you lose those features but you add more weight now they definitely should make one that has all of those features maybe not a hellcat
5:15 It’s peanut butter jelly time!
I’m sure this garbage produced only 475 hp not 800😀 interior cheap plastics & Dodge company asking for this garbage too much 💵😀 i think the best vehicle in market 2020 is Suzuki Forenza🤣🤣
He look like the white version ok kiko from chavo del ocho
You obviously don’t know what loud is.
i want to see it go against a Demon.
please do your research before calling this garbage the fastest sedan in the world. The bmw Alpina b7 is the fastest sedan in the world going 206mph
God cars these days are just massive... they get bigger and bigger every year. This is why I drive my 80-90's model cars the most.
9:55 he revs floors it infront of a cop!!!!
Certain Tesla owners are laughing at this claim, lol.
Fastest and fucking ugliest sedan on the market.
I'll settle for a 2016 hellcat
This is who you get when you order Jay Leno from wish.
Wheels 🤤
Peanut butter jelly time!  Peanut butter jelly time!!!
Brabus begs to differ...
A 90K$ suicide note... Not bad, really...
Doug Demuro is the jay leno of auto vlogs
Hate the flares
The original 'Charger', the car that made this name mean anything, was not a sedan... but it is now. Pass.
Production sedan***
While it's cool. Anything over 500 on the street is useless. And if a car can do over 160mph there needs to be a safety cage integrated into the body.
Doug: *looks at gas pedal*  Rear end: k bye
So my clio’s interior is pure luxury conpared to that
Doug that is not correct. There is a street legal CTV build by @Robb Sutton in partnership with Vengeance racing in Atlanta that has over 1k horse power and is in fact the fast sedan on earth.
Looks like it’s a 2010, super outdated design. The charger needs a redesign/body style change IMO.
wow, the car on his shirt gets moving when he drives
Raisin purple n brown interior I call It peanut Butter & jelly
Massive engine, ugly car
Surprised that the stance and figment is so poor, are they all like this from the factory?
Peanut butter and grape jelly 😲😆
What good is an extra 90HP if you can't exceed 210 MPH?
Was it only me that saw the color combination as grape jam / peanut butter?
Somewhere out there, there's a Mustang owner that will pull up next to this, rev his engine and ask for a race.
my 2013 rt max charger had all the features he says are missing lol
Tesla is better car😂 no seriously you prefer this over an electric car just for the sound of it 🥸
🔥💨🏁
I'll never buy another Dodger charger... pure junk, they spend too much time in the shop
You whine way to much, I have seen your video's and for me, you missed the point, you treat it like a rich kids toy, I hope you don't actually own one, cause you sure show it, as someone who really doesn't understands automotive's  that are create for this particular segment ,of society. I been around vehicles and and everything that has a motor, and your lack of understanding truly shows you really need to get a job, that isn't automotive in nature.
Anyone else not a fan of those front wheel flares? Reminds me of like, early 2000's Audi TT. All these sharp angles, angry high hp car, it feels like it doesn't belong
American car manufacturers  can screw up even the best car they came up with
a new Bentley Continental does 207 mph, the Mulsanne is possibly faster, so how is this the fastest sedan on the planet?
It doesn’t have the cruise control bc it’s the fully loaded one. I got a 2020 Dodge Charger RT PLUS and mine is the fully loaded. But it’s true the reason why I got the my charger was bc it’s a nice fast really specious sedan. There’s no other sedan that’s big as a charger. It’s a truck as a car.
The fastest production sedan don’t get cocky yank
See with cars like that, even the dodge demon, all your money goes into performance, not luxury. Quickest way to supercar levels of performance without the price
it wouldn't cost 3 grand to make the interior less ugly and old
Doug:  Hellcat is the fastest sedan on the planet. Tesla Model S P100D:  Hold my beer.
If I had one of these I'd see a lot of familiar interior pieces from my $6000 2013 charger pursuit 😝
"hahahahaha"   "actually I do find that kind of funny" killed me xD  kind of reminds me of Top Gear
the only reason they added a rear camera is because the mirror ripped off at 200mph
Who is this candy ass reviewing the car?
looks totaly ghetto
I feel like the majority of Chargers I see are at least a Scat or above.  Not sure where everyone’s getting their money from.    Just kidding I live in Saint Louis and they’re pretty much all fentanyl dealers.
“And today... I’ll be reviewing it!” Great pal, I’ll be sure to pick a couple up on the way home. 👍
I hate the backup camera can never see especially when curb parking and it's just a terrible now is it wasn't 2017 when mine was made but the resolution on my 2021 Ram is amazing
isn't a 2020 Model S Performance 0-60 better?
$300k worth of performance? Man that was funny.
If you take the time to put speed in subtitles for our Australian friends, do you have the time to also put the horsepower into kilowatts? Please
This happened to my backyard
It's a peanut butter and jam colour combination obviously!
SEDAN !!!!! BRING BACK THE COUPE
Pretty sure the Gemara is classed as a sedan.....Koenigzegg Gemara....250+ mph
I was expecting it to come with different wheels instead of the hc1
"800 horsepower! fastest sedan in the world! " etc etc. Yet once again, he CHOOSES to showcase it's mind-bending power in a residential neighborhood filled with speed bumps. SMH
305/35/R20 tires. Wheel 11" wide. OMG! A $-burning badass.
Another classic in the making. Glad Chrysler invested in that platform. GM had a chance to do that with their Holden-made cars, but nope.
MO’ POWAH BABY!!!!
you're paying for the FASTEST sedan in the world and one of the best looking..... not the most luxurious. just saying.
Doug, that lockdown is showing my guy. You gotten chunky. Or as some people say, boy u getting thick!!!
Overpriced Dodge... Why would any regular people buy this?
He praised them till he mention the price🤣🤣his mind changed instantly and roasted them🤣💀
Next up is the Dodge Charger Demon.
For the price just get a older dodge n put 10 grand I n it. Congrats u got something faster than a hell cat. Shit u could even put the badge on it. if they say something start it up.
8:50 AMOOOOOOOOOOO PAAAAWWWWWWWWWARRRRRRRRRR BABY
Nice car but damn! 90 grand! I bought an entire house for 95k years ago! It’s just crazy to me!
Lmao no it’s not
I think it is hilarious that they actually sell a 4WD version of that very car, but only with the base engine.  The Trackhawk is probably quite a bit faster in the real world, given that this thing will just sit there setting its tires on fire if you don't back off and baby it.  With 400 hp at each wheel, how fast do you have to be going before full throttle won't break the tires loose?  80?
0-60 in 3.5 seconds, fastest sedan in the world? More horsepower doesn't always mean faster.  M5 competition is like 3.1 seconds. I would argue the statement of fastest sedan in the world.
If you google "world's fastest production sedan" it's a bentley that tops at 207 MPH, i believe the red-eye topped in the high 180s because it's widebody kit isn't as aerodynamics as the non widebody.
Fastest sedan? Nah. I think the E63 S takes the crown for that in top speed, handling, and cornering
7:20 peanut butter over PURPLE HmM I WoNdEr wHeRe IvE sEeN tHaT cOlOr cOmBo BeFoRe 🤔”🥪”
Definitely not worth $87,000!!
Trash
Mo Powah Baby!
God I love fast sedans
I was wondering why the scenery looked so familiar, until Doug said it was Charlotte, NC
7:07 why change what modern american cars are known for?
No manual transmission? Not interested.
I get Doug's point about what people who buy these cars prioritize, but come on... My 15 year old Ford Mondeo's interior looks better and it has more features, like cruise control and automatic windshield wipers.
Maybe fast and powerful but god damn that car is sinfully ugly inside and out.
When you compare it to a 470hp 28 year old car. Congrats the E60 M5 ran over 200 12 years ago naturally aspirated 🤣
I liked it brief and useful
800 HP and a lot of plastic!
Peanut butter jelly time! Peanut butter jelly time!
Thissss....
bentley flying spur has a top speed of 207 mph
i dont agree its the fastest sedan on Earth, Brabus did some faster sedans years ago, and now Rocket 900...
Love German engineering and Italian styling but there’s something about what Dodge does that makes me want a muscle car
Ceartinly doesnt look like 800hp i like it
With Doug’s hair in the back it looks like he just woke up and did a review 😂
Just another cheap POS murican car
pbandj looks good at 200mph
Fastest CHEAPEST sedan! Nothing beats MERCEDES
Very fast garbage. I tow hemi everything and anything with catastrophic failure twice a week and tow at least 15-20 Chrysler products a week.
The rear camera should be better because EVERYTHING is behind you!
5:17 inside peanut butter outside jelly 😏
inside peanut butter outside jelly
*No one*  *Absolutely No One*  Dodge engineers making the Hellcat: IT’S PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME!
idk how this guy, with this many vids, doesnt bring some type of knee saver to keep his knees clean. Dirty ass knees in these clean cars is just sinful.
I find the use of fender flares instead of sculpted fenders very cheap. The car is definitely not sexy, and is pointless with US speed limits. But....  I still want one.
MY DREAM CAR
It is a beautiful sexy muscle car is not no luxury car so I can care less but all the little stuff inside of the car that’s my dream car and it’s still beautiful
Driving the fastest sedan in the world wich still is based on a in the meanwhile very old e-class platform through some residential areas.. Doug DeMuro these days! 😒👎🏼
Rental cars are still faster.
I know most of us come here to see Doug driving the cars he reviews, I was just hoping on this one in particular he went onto the highway and really let loose.
I know that supercharger sounds good, but shelby GT350‘s flat plane crank V8 sounds better
Lol. Also the worlds fastest deprecating asset too.
Demon has 840
This was all said about the Demon too and then a bmw m5 comp literally fucking dog walked it in it’s own world, the drag strip. These hellcats are getting quickly played out. Something new dodge something new
There are like 4 hellcats in my neighborhood and it’s awful how loud it is
Plot twist..............Doug loves guns more than he loves cars!
lmao the title is funny my ST 335i 4 door at 30psi would put ya to sleep world fastest sedan
8:50 Donut Media is Smiling with you
U realize u could just open the door closer
Until the Gemera gets here.
dodge 2030: dodge charger satan 1800 hp
Does it actually have red headlights?
lol who needs all that power it's like being a bodybuilder clerk working for a grocery store
Too bad most of the rectums that own them can't drive them without totalling them smh
All these features he mentions, I don't need or want.
they should make a wide body for a widebody
People dont buy dodge chargers for comfort or nice interiors dude you sound dumb. They buy them for their power and because its rear wheel drive
East Blvd Charlotte. I thought those houses looked familiar. Also Doug just wait until the Ghoul comes out.
to be honest with you Doug, cars at this price range may have bunch of other stuffs, features and better quality, but isnt as cool as this shit lmao also, pretty cool it still has stuff from a regular Charger like the plastic stuff on the interior, not gonna lie, it doesnt bother me at all since it has a ridiculous 800hp engine lmao
this car gets more beautiful as time passes lmao
11:45 curious to know what car that was that you can hear
Why didn't he upload this on his main channel?
That exhaust note is super sweet!
Garbage though. Fun for a lease for a couple years, couldn't pay me to own one.
Title is inaccurate. Love your videos, Doug, but this car is LITERALLY not the world's fastest sedan. This things top speed is 203 MPH. The top speed of the BMW Aplina B7 is 205 MPH and the Bentley Flying Spur is 207 MPH.
People that can't talk without flailing their hands and arms all about crack me up. :)
Laughs in CTS-V 😂😅
Anybody else said “baby” in their head when Doug said: “More Power” lol
the bentley flying spur is faster (330kph)
I work for a manufacturer that actually supplies exterior parts for the Challenger and Charger...that color used to be called Black Eye.
where is the durango video
No point to get faster car unless you want lot of speeding tickets 😜
You're always laughing at your own comments. Get to the point.
Bentley is the fastest sadan
This looks fugly. I'd choose the widebody over this any day. In a Camaro SS rental from Hertz this week and the startup sounds exactly the same.  Sure 200mph but how long will it take to get it too 200mph. Stick with a base and build it yourself.
They should’ve called the color scheme Peanut Butter and Helly
Its not a dodge charger its a daage charger  This guy can pronounce anything
Yea its fastest sedan. can fast aceleration but bmw m5 e60 can drive 345+kph
But they look same as a GT package, Scat pack etc.  These are famous for street takeovers now so I wouldn't want to be associated with those.
I think my favorite part about these engines is when you open the hood there’s no big plastic cover over the engine. Just beautiful hemi with that giant equally gorgeous supercharger
The door has a grab handle by the window
This is the car you need when you’re on your final written warning and you need to be to work in 15 minutes across town.
looking at the front suspension of the SUV on Doug's tee
MORE POWER BABY!!
Doug is the type of guy that reviews a 797 hp car......drives it through suburbs going 25mph.
My guy hadn’t heard of the bmw f90 comp apperently cus it will do 340kmh
I like the car but I really really don’t like that color... The color does not do that car justice:(
It is also one of the biggest POS's when it comes to reliability. Like most Chrysler vehicles. They have the worst reliability ratings than anyone in the industry. Facts.... ..https://www.thedelite.com/worst-rated-cars-trucks-suvs-market/2/
HELLPHANT
this car has everything over the muscle cars of the 60's and early  70's. Straight line acceleration, cornering, power everything, A/C etc, etc. Everything but one, looks. Pull a 1970 GTX or a Hemi Cuda, 1970 SS 454 Chevelle, 65 Big Block Corvette the list goes on and on  up to this car at a traffic light and guess which one will get all the looks. I rest my case.
My 04 accord has automatic windshield wipers and this doesn't? Tf Chrysler? xD
*Still a Chrysler. Will begin falling apart at around 20,000 miles.*
Ugliest color they could possibly put on this car...
There are plenty of videos of the BMW M5 sedan V10 engine model that went over 200MPH from a decade ago. This car is a joke.
Was ne Scheisskarre🤣🚮
You can buy last gen of corvette, for this money, and tune him... overprice dodge
So is that car faster than a AMG GT 63s?
Amg gt63s fast sedan in the world 😁
Catch it on the street and it’s running 4 sec 0-60. Meh. Gotta have traction these days.
Guys he's becoming more like Jay leno
Seems like all these makers are trying to add as much power and fun as possible before electric autonomous vehicles take over, so better get your fun in now.
Who the fcku would buy one as a Daily-Driver/Commuter? Definitely ME!  In RED please. Luv the vids Doug. Thanks mate!
And the ugliest too presumably...
“inside peanut butta, outside jelly”  - Cadillac Don & J Money
Thought tesla was the fastest sedan??
Pretty sure the Plaid is gonna spank this car 8 ways from Sunday
That's one fast looking Fiat.
Doug : “the fastest sedan in the world”  Dougs Knee’s :  >_<
Adaptive cruise control sucks
the charger is the car you buy when you cant afford a challenger and a second car. but when you get to the point were it cost 90K im just confused
Most people want their phone tethered to something in an 800hp car because no amount of surface friction is going to keep it from flying around your interior when you mash that pedal
https://youtu.be/iYCBHiV2xEI
The color combo makes perfect sense. It’s PB&J.
Did he seriously not say that the color scheme is peanut butter and jelly? He said PEANUT BUTTER and not JELLY! Close, Doug. Very close.
Doug can you do us all a favor? Can you take a shower , comb your hair and wash and dry your clothes? You look like a absolute bum!!
Driving this is the automotive equivalent of eating puffer fish cooked by an amateur chef
Think you can outrun a state tropper?
Sound like this car is made for the drag strip
inside peanut butter outside jelly
Hey guys, recently got into car crash. If there is anything you could do to help that would be greatly appreciated🙏🏾 https://www.gofundme.com/f/car-crash-gone-wrong
Car looks so Donald Trump!
Plum Crazy Purple.
It’s funny Porsche removes stuff and charges more and no one says anything Dodge follows the same format and it is such a sin.
Have you heard of the Tesla model s plaid?
Great car review Doug thank you😂
More power=mopar
Good
Is the Gerema in the same class?  Isn't it faster?
all the chaldeans in sterling heights mi dream of this car
Hey Doug they should lower that price from 90K to 80K brand new because of Lack of Interior.
Peanut butter and Jelly
Don't you dare and say "more power" in that wat. Donut Media owns that.
I think everybody knows what a hellcat is.
Baby poo colored seats...........
The Tesla Model S Plaid, a sedan, does 0-60 in under 2 seconds. And, the quarter mile time is in the 9s.
Doug really ranked the cool factor of a charger hellcat higher than the new 2020 GT500 🙄
they should make these the new police car
THISSSSSSS
I love this color though 🔥😍😍😍
The last step in the assembly line should be to crush all gas engined vehicles. Chrysler will wind up on the bankruptcy heap with Toyota and Honda for not electrifying the fleet fast enough
The fastest car in the world is...... A rental car. Jeremy Clarkson said it first.
i really like the raisin purple
Faster than the demon? And srt ghoul with hellephant v8?
Fastest stock Sedan, My E90 335i is significantly faster.
These front doors open so wide because it was designed as police vehicle in mind where the front doors open wide because of practically and protection reason! Btw. this car has automatic wipers - maybe better read the manual first as usual...
The Demon is faster.
Dr. Eibachs... emergency... Dr. Eibachs, emergency room. Stat!
https://youtu.be/jz7_Cl1cw6w This is the best traditional rap song from my country 🇸🇱
Ah, yes.  Another overpowered "masculine" Chrysler vehicle that people with no performance car experience are going to buy and quickly wreck because it's moderately affordable (since they still live with their auntie Janeece), likely taking out some minivan full of old ladies along the way.  I see more of these moving at very high rates of speed in traffic, being completely unsafe. Which is okay, because I also see these things wrapped around telephone poles and upside down in ditches more often than any other vehicle on the road.
Rappers gonna go crazy for this🤦‍♂️🥶
How do you even make 90,000 dollars
This guy has such a punchable face...
Never liked the Charger styling. The Challenger is much better.
Dodge Is the Ferrari of America
There are too many chargers
Dodge be like; one motor in every car.
The Durango has automatic wipers
MO' POWAH BABY!
I bet giulia GTA is faster on a track
I got the new Scatpack. Fully loaded, and not a single thing was changed interior wise. My brother has a 2014 SRT8 and ot looks exactly the same minus the digital display in between the gauges
UGH - your bitching about the stuff the Charger doesn't is annoying as hell - NO ONE CARES about those items, NO ONE is buying this car for it's back up camera, it's pretty glovebox latch... they are buying it to go fast in one direction.
If these Chargers weren't so outdated.
Chargers do come with adaptive cruise. Not sure why the redeye doesn't have it but my charger has it and mines a 2013. Also there is automatic wipers. You enable them in the uconnect settings menu.
I bought one at 1pm. Lost my license at 1:30 pm. I wish.
Just to remind you Doug. The bentley flying spur does 207 miles pr hour, to this hellcat 203 miles pr hour. In my world the bentley flying spur is the worlds fastest sedan, the dodge SRT hellcat might be the crazyiest though
Hellcat PB&J
a charger without a charger
I think Doug is thinking of a Mercedes 90k dollar car..this is a 4 door charger with 797hp. That 90k is worth 800hp any day
So we have cars made for the autobahn but when are we actually going to get an autobahn? Highest speed limit in my state (CA) is like 65-70mph. You'll fuck around and ruin your life driving this thing at even a fraction of it's capability, lol.
I heard that in the Dodge offices they call that color statutory grape
Great way to piss off the neighbors
Chrysler garbage
The panamera is a sedan,  is it not?
You're looking so happy with this AMAZİNG BEAST
What about the brabus900 rocket?
Why have the not gotten rid of that cheesy indent on the door panels yet?? It has always looked horrible and it still does. 👎
You don’t buy a charger hellcat red-eye for plastics or a good back up camera....
Why is this video on this channel versus the main channel?
For me if I buy a muscle car I’m paying for the performance not the interior
fastest Sedan car n the world my ass. 2020 Bentley Flying Spur is faster. maybe fastest car consuming fuel? fastest car found Dead on the Side of the Road? 😄😄😄 😄😄😄 😄😄😄 😄😄😄 😄😄😄 😄😄😄
Looks like nothing in front of the legendary Bmw M5
I’ll take an M5 instead, just as fast and way nicer interior
the paint and interior combo reminds me of  PB&J
ur cringe af
fairly confident the Tesla Model S plaid edition is significantly faster than this
90k garbage
Holy shiii this car is amazing super mean car
Ur paying for the 800hp, nothing else.
There is a lot of misleading information in this video.. And dodge stole that a.c. cooling down the supercharger from me. Only difference is I was suggesting pumping the air straight to the motor
Please convert the HP to kw like you do the pound feet to nm
There cars are amazing.  But Jeep,Dodge and Chrysler have the worst service and roadside assistance departments in the country.  Most of them have a 1.9 out of 5 stars. So just don't break down lol.
Inside Peanut Butter, outside Grape Jelly 😂
the only creature comfort I want that dodge didn't include is a WAGON
you need cruise control in a hellcat?😭
Does this get the Doug award for the ugliest color car you have ever reviewed?  Oh there are some rival ugly colors in the history of cars but probably not any you reviewed.
I'd say these things are going to be worth a fortune in 20 years but we all know there won't be any still on the road by then.
Purple? Hahaha I thought it was grey... #colorblind 😂
That’s the pb&j mobile
Shut up Meg
What you need to understand is the price point comes from performance and performance only.   Performance > features  This car would be 150,000 if it had all the fancies.
If Dodge hikes the price up again, the next Hellcat better be AWD, or at least have an option to make it AWD.
missed the chance to call this car peanut butter and jelly. smh doug smh
I will stick with my twin turbo 2006 honda accord. lol
A boat with 800hp now thats just stupid
Not a manual.
you can make some of your money back when you buy that car
i love that FCA makes these outlandish cars.
Inside Peanut butter Outside Jelly - Cadillac Don 🤣😂
It delivers on paper. But mostly a POS car with a bunch of money sunk into an unusable level of engine power. A well optioned R/T or Scatpack in the 40k-50k range is a much better deal.
According to Reddit, a 2013 civic Si with a cold air intake and a muffler delete is the world's fastest sedan
"Endless money pit"
Of course it’s a Michigan plate😂😂😂
Mo powa bebeh
I am wondering: will the Cars and Bids commercial intro ever end?
If you own a c8 corvette 2020 and you add more hp to it like 300 BELIEVE ME  this SRT is nothing for the c8.   And wait for the 2022 z06 it’s gonna be quicker, the motor is in the back of the car. It’s just PERFECT if you add more hp
The hood 🤮🤮
Peanut butter inside, jelly color outside, and tons of horsepower from factory. The literal definition of a "Sweet Ride."
You’re starting to just throw anything out on your thumbnail titles lol
Keep that good shit up my nigga fuck what everybody else says get that moneyy!!
more powah baby
All those features just sound like added weight😤
A car for rich-daddy frat boys who trash them in the first year. And it's not just a bad color, the finish looks low quality. But if I can't say anything nice, I won't.
I would be really cool to floor it Toronto to Montréal in 90 minutes (300 miles.)  It can actually take nearly that long getting home across Toronto...
Yeah, I'd definitely spend $90K on something much nicer. 😂
Come do my car!!!
Im in Charlotte
Oh my god
has Dodge considered Suicide doors? Perhaps it can help with the wide opening or maybe that was what Dodge intended.
You didn't check the back seats noooo
Doug. Are you really serious about all the Cons about this Beast. Who gives a S**T.  It’s all about the Power 😂😂😂😂😂😂
D O D G E C H A R G E R
I so want one
You should’ve gone to McLaren of Charlotte while in the area
more power. please.
😭😭😭😭 I work 24/7 for this car but life smacking me
Wow.  That is one ugly boat of a car.
damn if i knew you were in charlotte i would’ve pulled up
Hah! Fun fact- it’s not the fastest sedan on earth. The Mercedes BRABUS ROCKET 900 is. 900 HP, 0-60 in 2.5 sec, top speed of 205 mph. (330 kph)
I have never heard of automatic windshield wipers
*Laughs In BMW M5 competition and Audi RS7”
Dug forever on his knee on that dam pavement lol at least it’s not gravel this time.
arrogant  does not want to hear their  customer needs
World's fastest production Sedan**
I have a 2017 Chevy SS that I paid only 36K for back in Jan with 9K miles. With 10K in mods I would be at this power level plus have a nice interior and great handling for 46K. BUT... I'm on my own. F up the install of cam and blower? I'm paying for the new engine. Blow out the dif? Paying for it. Blow the trans? On me. This 800 hp comes with a warranty folks! Beat the shit out of it and everything you break is on THEM!
Looks sweet on the outside and the power......inside sucks balls
Peanut butter and jelly 🙄 duhhhh
They should make this a police car
9:55 Doug, u passed a cop :()
Half of the interior looks just like my 2013 Journey. That super charger sounds cool though.
World's fastest Sedan?  ...  Tesla want's a word lol
My friend bought a 19' Challenger hellcat and got smoked by two different M5s on the street and he was SO upset, I felt a little bad for laughing when he told me but I told him its just because of the awd (probably).
Just seen Caaaars and Bids 🙌  mentioned on a C4 Corvette page I'm on. Cars and Bids is going to have the 1988 Prototype C4 Corvette Z-R1up for auction!! The C4 Corvette Z-R1 wasn't in production until 1990!! This is truly a piece of automotive history!! So Check it out on Cars and Bids!!
Do you get a coffin and burial service included in the MSRP?
M5 is faster...
So why do you do a whole review that boils down to this car sucks except for its chilling performance, then take it for a spin restricted to local roads with 25 or 35 mph speed limits?  The dealership must have made him agree to this, at which point I would have told the dealer that there would be no review.  He gets to take million dollar cars onto the highway, but not this $90,000 one.  Bizzare.
"We're changing an extra 10k for a charger. What do you want?" "MORE POWER BABY!!"
Never seen better use of taxpayer money. Now when will we see what GM has done with our money.?
I wonder what the decibel level is at highway speeds .  I would like to see how it would perform at Nuremberg  or Nuremberg style track .
Peanut butter and jelly car 😎
I don’t understand why Doug is so confused by the Raisin/Peanut Butter combination. Has he not heard of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?
No it ain’t
Chrysler cash grab.
Horrendous trash.
I love seeing these automakers pushing the envelope , and raising the stakes in the HP wars.  It’s so....American.  So keep your  battery powered hybrid crap. Send it all to Europe for all I care.
So be honest... when you're enjoying the power, it's not just the power (and body sensation)... it must also be the sound or even the momentary delay from when you push the pedal and when you feel the push in the seat).  Were it not for those details, surely you would be saying that "this just isn't as exciting as a Tesla".
"People who buy them... don't care about the interior materials..."  Maybe they care, but I suspect their preferences are set for the velour wood trimmed sofas and double wide trailer homes they grew up in.  Given that perspective, you might say this was a classy interior!
Can you get a manual transmission?
FYI: it is called "Redeye" because it makes your eyes burn, and you wish you had never seen it.
The poor man's super car.
Fastest sedan only because someone hasn't demonstrated their tuned Panamera.
Doug... What the hell are you smoking? The Model S has over a second faster 0-60?
dodge bros.would be proud!
The BMW M5 e60 V10 will do around 210mph without the speed limiter. So this is not the fastest sedan out there.
666k views
If you wanted all of the features PLUS the power... This would be far more than a $90k car.... Chrysler took a page out of the Nissan book.... Throw money at high end performance.... And less towards luxury... 🤷🏾‍♂️
I fuck with the peanut butter jelly colorway
Cheap plastic, cheap materials, perfect car for anyone in the ghetto and their 5-7 year loan.
So its a 797 HP Peanut Butter Samwich!
5:35 Happy to see tat Doug addressed the issue i feel everyday with my charger.
The erratic nation bizarrely balance because canada culturally level a a damp birth. wholesale, disillusioned carpenter

All this fake laughter from these car channel hosts is getting creepy.  From Doug constantly cocaine laughing like DeNiro in Cape Fear in all the wrong places and not even trying to hide how contrived it is to Alex at Legit Street Cars also laughing constantly to the XF motorsports guy laughing all the time for no reason.  Seriously, Doug looks completely coked out on this one.
But who in the world would buy a car as ugly and cheap as that? There's so many slower cars that are better in every way.
Tesla model S: *_Am I a joke to you?_*
They can change up the dash board a little more the jeep dash board is better then that

Sick!!!! This is really my style!!! Big & Bold!!!
Wish the anti theft system was better
This not scatpack this a hellcat!! 😤🤫
That color is definitely jolly rancher grape
I get it; reverse cameras are cool.  They have probably helped thousands of people to, back up.  But, how many more gadgets are manufacturers going to add, to make people think they're better drivers?
Never understood why absolutely every single military dude, their mother, their wife and their wife's boyfriend all have a Charger
Isn't a Brabus Rocket even faster? Many people consider Brabus, like Alpina, a manufacturer, not a tuner.
Bmw m5: i m joke to you?
MO POWAH BABY
Shoutout Charlotte squad!
I raced a hellcat in my 94 accord awd coupe with 88mm twin turbos maoing 625 up and beat him b 3 cars in the 1/4 mike
It's peanut butter jelly time!!!
Yeah the South loves chargers and challengers.
It's so fast, it outran the quality checks that sought to keep it from showing up on blocks in front of a trailer park 5 years from now.
Why’d he let the door swing open like that though?🤢😭😢
Less bling bling features=nothing to go wrong
Fastest sedan? Alpina B5: Hold my beer..
The reason the car doesn’t come with a wireless charger is because the car itself is a Charger.
Faster than the 2021 Audi RS7?
so... when theres a dodge charger demon?
2020 Alpina B5 will do 340 kph... so yeah
Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Tesla they are all faster than this car
Peanut butter jelly time.....
I hate adaptive cruise control. I also hate auto start stop. My Hellcat has automatic wipers so it is an option but I appreciate that Dodge hasn't gotten away from what the original intent of the cars is. I would never use wireless charging so that feature doesn't trip my trigger either. If the vehicle was being used for driving long distances, I could see where that might be nice but most of the people I know don't log a ton of miles with their car. I have 25k on my car in 4 years of ownership.
Why no 4 Wheel Drive?
I'm sure it's great in a straight line and an absolute death trap on the slightest of corners.
The only reason why this car is called the fastest Sedan is cuz they don't test their cars on Nürburgring  but on a  1/4 mile straight  or some kind of bullshit ..
Model S Performance?
every time i see something like this i just want to put the engine in something stupid an 800 hp prius or something
Totally missed opportunity for a MO POWA BABY with Donut Media
I don't know who gets excited about it's top speed, i mean except some parts of the autobahn in Germany or a deserted airstrip there is no place in the whole wide world where you can drive it's top speed and that is their selling point...It probably only good for braging about it though
https://www.youtube.com/user/TheAce617
But it might be a lack of features but also you can get a better interior option you have to request it
Doug: Moah Powah! Donut Media: Hey! That's Illegal!
PB&J color combo!
MORE POWAAAAAAARRRR!
Inside peanut butter, outside jelly!
8:50 mo powah babe
More power baby! Shout out to James the Kentucky cobra

How fast to buyers want to go on the street? All it's going to do is either destroy your license or wrap you around a tree, if you can't drive it responsibily.
This dude looks a mix of Letterman and Leno! 😆
Adaptive cruise control comes with most cheap minicars in Europe...
Doug loves to floor the pedal of an 800hp car in a residential area
Probably the worst color spec i have ever seen
But probably can’t go around corners 🤔😂😂😂😂😂🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Is it actually faster than the Model S? Because from the numbers you gave the Model S would be faster even without the new better version coming next year.
Fast on straight aways
At this point Dodge is just trolling car industry...700hp SEDAN,700hp COUPE,700hp SUV and 700hp TRUCK,come on...
This niggas fake laugh😹😹💔
I love how they 'had' to add a bigger scoop on the hood for air but the actual air intake is on the front left?!? Damned dodge!
such a clean charger
Doug-the door opens up so far  Me-Don’t open the door all the way open -_-
Next is corvette c8
E60 M5 is still faster as well as the new Alpina B7.
The accessible country immediately smoke because baseball electronmicroscopically stamp atop a vigorous action. accurate, soft geranium
"The Power Chiller"..that's so cool🥶 What a beautiful piece of machinery. Awesome.
That purple looks really good
Iss Made for skinny tall drug dealers like me das why your arms dont reach doug
Jizz is a dodge charger
If you can't  pay cash for it then it's  just another overpriced pile of crap !
Coming to a sideshow near you
Fastest sedan in the world Craig in the world craig 🤣😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣 shut yo ass up day day
Yup it needs a mid muffler delete
May be the fastest, but definitely not the quickest.
dodge is the end of the end. they are amazing, powerful, and fast cars. They will die with fossil fuels.
Mo powah baby
This car is gangster.
Doug: “and it’s available to you” Me: 😢I’m in Australia, dodge only sell SUVs here 😭
An AWD system would be awesome for more money haha
You forgot about super bee
ayyyyy lets goooo!!!
I’m getting this next
6:28  you're welcome
But how is the reliability?
World’s fastest sedan .... is nothing but a false claim...  just BS
Man you were literally 10 minutes from my house in this video haha
This charger has better interior than the McClaren 600LT! Miles ahead infact. The charger has nice leather while the 600LT has disgusting looking alcentra,and disgusting amounts of it as well.
2020 bentley flying spur has a faster top speed, and M5 competition has faster acceleration as does the tesla model s, so this isn't the fastest sedan in the world.  comparing this to a Ferrari F40 from the 80's is a little ridiculous.
I've never liked chargers. I still don't. 👎
They gotta release a 6 speed Manual Transmission 😪🤧
Fastest sedan 354849496 times
Is it 800 horsepower? Does it go over 200mph?
The peanut butter jelly demon. Sounds like a birdman bar from the mid 00s
Would a comb and bottle of gel and a barber really hurt to have Doug.
Not sure I'd still get one over a loaded super duty.
You forgot about the skat pack
Surprised the acceleration score is that low
https://youtu.be/iAMOdy5UIUo
A Supra would leave tht charger at gapplebees😂
The price tag is just for the powertrain really. The body is more of an add-on accessory
That Durango hellcat 😍😍
Doug! It’s peanut butter and jelly colouring!
Will the challenger have the same specs as well ? I love the 2 door challenger body
Does it come in manual 🤔🤨🧐
Dodge chill out
They have to get to 1000 hp
"You don't have any control over this"  Great car review doug thank you😂
AND you can finance this beauty at 4.5% interest ( 10k down) for $998 a month for 72 months, then add $2,000 a month for insurance ( if you have a clean driving record and are over 30 yrs old) so for 3 K a month you can have a car that goes 209 MPH in a country where the top speed limit is 85 mph and that's on Texas highway 130. So you really can't go any faster than a $15,000 Honda civic with a $90 a month insurance premium. If you do, and get even 1 speeding ticket, you'll be washing windshields at a red light somewhere with cup in hand just to pay Geico. I'd call it a "summer rental": You'll be able to keep it for 3 months before it gets repo'd. Good luck to anyone considering buying this ugly duckling,,
I think the color combination is sexy as hell...  Makes sense
I mean not gonna hate on Doug but this beast was made for speed and hp not Luxury
Buys car... takes out engine... throws away car.
I'm sorry but no one actually opens the door all the way
It’s stupid, grotesque, ridiculous, and I absolutely adore it.
I. Need. It.
Cheap...plastic...blah blah blah...goes really fucking fast and sounds like it eats school children.
I traded my Jeep SRT because of the plastic and overall terrible interior quality... I definitely would've paid more for an upgraded cabin.
Hot take: Doug is just bad at driving fast cars that don't have a ton of nannies to keep him safe.
Tesla is faster.
$300000 car performance yeah right throw some corners at and watch it fall apart 🤦‍♂️
Ugly....That Red Durango during his ad was beautiful though
Somewhere, StreetSpeed717 is thinking to himself: "Just stay away from Track mode Doug."
For now.  Gawd, I love Dodge!!!
MASSIVE!
To think a porsche 911 turbo s will destroy this car in a drag. 10.1s so it's almost a full second faster
Name another car with 800 hp for $80k.
I want to love it but it’s profile screams budget
3:30 when you are at a drag strip. They tell you not to use the a/c because water will drip on the track. How do Dodge keep that from happening?
I have 9,930 subs on my automotive channel. How many subs do I need to buy one of these cars?
Can you do the super stock Doug?
Look at Doug terrorizing suburban Charlotte!
GM is 9+10=21% stupid.
This car slow asf. Off the dig, I’ve seen 350whp Infiniti’s leave this shit in the dust
Not sure why everyone loves the headlamps of the '15 plus... They seem incomplete and don't integrate well with the grille. 2012-2014 looks WAY more classic...
Yes, there is/was a guy at your high school who had a base model charger r/t with a million miles and claimed it was this.
Every time i see a car like this is a very "criminal look" person driving it lmao
Platform sharing killed these and the Challengers.
I heard they released a elephant hellcat version that cost $200k but idk if true
I see Dodge is going for die a hero approach to bankruptcy.
It still looks like a piece of shit Dodge Product. Looks like something from 2010
Sucks that Dodge didn't update the front clip and rear taillight.  Such a small investment that would give this car added life with the hotrodding until their electric vehicles get here.
The Tesla Model S Plaid will be the fastest Sedan in the World
SEDAN MEANING ITS NOT COOL 😒 MEANING DODGE WAKE UP MAKE A 2 DOOR CHARGER LIKE IT ORIGINALLY WAS !!!! Coming from a challenger owner here...
You make best vids man
I remember when the 400 hp Viper came out and that was a big deal.....or the zr1 Corvette with 375hp was "super fast".....how did that become normal and no big deal?  800hp sounds pretty fun.
When he said "More Power!" I swear I was waiting for "Moh Powah Babe!"
MO POWAH BABY!!
That awful cheap plastic everywhere in the interior.
pretty sure charger doors open up that wide because they're service vehicles
Doug Demuros last word: THIS
I have a 5.7 hemi :(
Add the option of AWD and it will Annihilate all.
It's fast and all, but it's a 2021. And who the hell want to drive 200 MPH LMAO! Dodge should have at least put a different model design on it. At least a little bit.  I'll wait until they change the body style.
M5 comp package??
adaptive cruise and use ur mirrors bud
The interior is long overdue to be upgraded...
Hell Raisin... !?! Shoulda called it "Plum Crazy"
I want Dodge to make a shorter wheelbase 2 door version of this car
Doug: "No automatic wipers, OMG." So much stupid with Doug. Super entertaining but literally half of what he says if like listening to the dumbest car reviewer ever. The other day watching a review he noted a car that could open the rear wing windows with a push of a button on the dash and he thought that was a new interesting innovation... Except the family minivan in 1994 had that as well, as an option on the base trim. So dumb.
An engine with a free car noice
It's PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME
It has automatic wipers - You turn it on in infotainment unit and sensor on window puts wipers on.
Has he review the challenger hellcat redeye?
What a special time to be alive in America. We have cars called the hellcat, demon, super snake, a gt350 which makes an amazing sound, a gt500 which is incredible, cars as capable on track as a ZL1, a truck called the Raptor, or the TRX, and most of these cars being 40-50K on the used market. I know people have their own arguments about which brand is better, but do not take this for granted, we won't see a time like this again.
its simple peanut butter and jelly
I'd like to see the lite version, the "pink eye"
The Charger started as a Muscle car and ends as a sedan 💔, Dodge Challenger starts as a Muscle car and keeps bein a Muscle car
He sounds like mr beast or is it juss me
dude its not going to have a big display screen or have different reverse camera angles. It is a fucking track car or just a street car its not meant to be so luxurious. People only want it because they trying to get away from the police quick ass hell.
lol why does this dude get access to all these sweet whips?
So basically the engine is a giant ice maker
Its a $20k car with a $60k engine . Your paying for the engine
Actually it’s not the fastest. BMW alpina b7 is the fastest
Fastest in a straight line!!! Send it on the nurburgrin and it will crash in the first curb!!
Been waiting to upgrade my RT but... 90k is a bit much in this crumbling world economy.   Besides @Streetspeed717 is about to announce me as the winner of his 900hp ZR1 soooo.... 😁
This is gonna be the future of police cars
Would really love to own one even if it's only for a short time. But that's slightly over what i want to spend. Mustang GT was enough.
The fact that it looks like every other Charger around but goes faster than anybody can possibly think, I like that surprise factor❗️❕❗️☝️😉
cars and bids over priced fees auction
inside peanut butter outside jelly...7 days of the week 7 different... Hellcats
PB&J sedan!
Worlds fastest sedan?  Laughs in BMW M5 and E63 AMG.  Not to mention doing over 120 in this under-engineered turd with 90's tech is already dangerous.
Exactly no need to buy a Lamborghini..
Doug in 2019: THISSSSSSS Doug in 2020: Be sure to check out CARS AND BIDSSS!! Mf its covid im barely getting 1/4th of my paycheck. I am in no financial position to sell my car nor bid on a new one. So please Doug stop asking
I feel like these cars are the sedan equivalent of pickup trucks.. always a douchebag driving it recklessly... revving the engine super loud as if its a ferrari. lame
The Hellcat Redeye could have manual windows and no one would care!
They should make mandatory driving classes when u buy dis piece..
8:50 Mo Power Baby!!!!

The interior is the main reason I went with a Ram Limited. I understand the power part but for that money I need a nicer interior.
Isn’t the demon even faster?
The doors open wide for police use
Meh still a dodge that most people will wrap around a tree because they don't know about how to drive a hp car. I rather have 2021 Audi RS7 600hp with AWD and class.
I'm going to wait for external adjudication because taking their word that it does over 200
The interior is the main reason I went with a Ram Limited. I understand the power part but for that money I need a nicer interior.
wow the demon has some practical competition
Im A Deputy Sheriff and have issued 2019 AWD Dodge Charger and the interior looks the same
Ridiculous price in Australia.  A charger hellcat, not a redeye, $189,990AUD. Or, just over $140,000USD
It sounds like my 1973 Granville convertible. Had a 455 SD PP with thrush glass packs. It was in the 1972 inaugural parade. I really miss that car. When you floored it it sank down before taking off like a rocket. It was dark blue with white leather. Fender skirts and Pontiac mags.
Bentley flying spur is a faster sedan. This is 203mph the spur is 207mph. Ill give it a regular cigarette but not a cigar
WOW...This channel is obviously of interest to men and so is HAIR LOSS, so I post this important notice here. Conventional medicine has FAILED to solve HAIR LOSS because it has focused only on blocking DHT. I cured my HAIR LOSS with a NEW method described at WWW.BORNAGAINHAIR.COM which explains why the MAIN cause of HAIRLOSS is not DHT but a reduction in the BLOOD FLOW to the scalp due to a tight lower scalp layer called the GALEA and shows how to cure hair loss with no drugs, no lotions and no surgery. Get the e-book. It costs only 29.95 and this REALLY, REALLY WORKS
what about the koenigsegg gemera
Clearly someone’s never heard of the Tesla Model S Plaid Edition
Ever heard of the 2010 bmw b7 alpina u will forget saying after seeing it which is the fastest sedan from the planet
Insurance companies: “You bought a what?”
Mr organik?
When u know the 2020 bentley continental flying spur w12 can hit 340kmph with ease and u call this shit the fastest sedan on the planet🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣no i understood why everyone makes fun of u doug
Km/h is for people who wish the car was faster than what it's actually capable of.
Wait for the 2022 version feature on the 9 chapter of fast and furious   https://images.app.goo.gl/Kq12NNrFBLW2Yxxr5   https://images.app.goo.gl/TzRSp28YDS99mwrV9
Wonder how long it will take to see one of these stolen here in Chicago, gutted and on bricks somewhere in the hood.
Bro u drove by my house
"TTHHiSss is a.. "💀💀💀I laugh at the intro everytime
You said more power but where is the babeh
Why is this on the "More DD" instead of the regular channel?
Can't wait for college douchebags to start driving these in a year.      (Why are you booing me? I'm right!)
5:26 just driving in my 797hp peanut butter and jelly vehicle that can go 200mph lol
Am i the only one worried about the hood slamming on Doug?
Hell "raisin" purple and peanut butter brown because it's Dodge's classic, like peanut butter and jelly.
The Bentley Flying Spur is a tad faster.
Isn't the E63s a sudan that is fast too.
This with some Corsa extremes would go so crazy
Brabus 900 rocket is faster
It’s starting to look outdated
Jay Leno's love child.
Can’t blame dodge all these years I knocked them. They are definitely doing their best with what little they have and the outcome has been amazing performance wise, otherwise the car is dated and needs upgrades.
Next year, " *Dodge Challenger Hellcat RedEye deluxe Comfort* "
Even the door HANDLES are unusually cheap. Almost every car uses the pull handle bar while the charger refuses to update from the lift door handle
mmmmm...PB&J
So its faster than a m5 comp and flying  spur  ok sounds like a drag run and rolling race is in order  and pretty sure I'm missing another car up there too
Boring intérieur 2021 !  Still the same
never had any american car other than ford explorers and expeditions... i stick with japanese cars and i lease.. can anybody that actually has one of these give a review?  honestly - is it really worth it?
Mo powah baby!!!
Doug, you look like a camp counselor who listens to Nickleback. Buy some new clothes!
At 5:07.....alright, listen Dodge/Chrysler , you guys have the sickest names for your performance vehicles & now the color too!?...I applaud you.
Until plaid is released
Dodge Peanutbutter Jelly
‘Cheap interior plastic’ means it’s not gloss. Good. Brushed aluminum would be great but I’d take matte black plastic.
The front end is still not good looking to rounded
I’ll never be over to get over fca’s horrible interiors and tech 😫
Never will buy a dodge, I'll dodge that. (Pun Intended)
When Doug said “More Power” I was hoping he would cut to Donut’s “Mo Powa Baby”
Fastest sedan in the world is the bmw alpina b7 at 205mph
Crazy that they remove so many features. My 2015 Charger RT had adaptive cruise control haha. It had auto-sensing wipers too.  My 2017 model... does not however.
the worlds fastest and most unreliable car in the world
The reason the car doesn’t come with a wireless charger is because the car itself is a Charger.
The interior is not as bad as you're making it out to be. They come standard with a lot of nice features and the seats/leather are awesome quality.
The 300SRTs that are available overseas have a super much better interior than their Charger/Challenger SRT counterparts. I would totally buy a 300SRT; dunno why the hell Chrysler LLC doesn't offer them here in America.
Can't you just get an old hellcat, install a smaller pulley, and get a tune for the same power gains?
interesting. i was looking at one of these as an upgrade to a stinger. the stinger is quite nice inside, and i acutally like the combo of a nice relaxed ride and power, so might have to pass on it. but it's just so crazy
Its funny that i have adaptive cruise control and rain sensor wipers on my '13 SRT-8 but then again that was like the last "SRT" made🤷‍♂️
How to depreciate your money 101.

The buttons on the steering wheel are very similar to those in the latest Dacias!
Some people really binging up the Bentley and BMW Alpina 😂😂, and how much more do those cars cost plus maintenance cost and not to mention the horrible resale value they have check their reviews! Even the chargers are better 🤣
I'm 16 years old and barely looking for a job. I can't wait to save up money and buy a 2016 Dodge Charger R/T. Wish me luck boys.

Imagine if the feds get ahold of this thing, where screwed
10:01 ...that's what she said.
It goes like 220 miles per hour
So far, not a single one of your videos I haven't enjoyed. Great work, bro.
Nobody that has test this car has achieved better than 11.8 1/4  stop with the fake dodge claims this car is not as fast as dodge claims
I don’t see the M5 Competition here it’s the fastest production sedan with 175 less horsepower , beats every sedan on the planet , 800hp and still can’t beat an m5 with 625hp both are similar in weight , what a bogus name for this video
you should use term highest top speed. Its not the fastest sedan.
I’d pay 45 max
Ill take a 340i anyday over this
Doesn't use turn signals the entire time the idiot drives it.
"But honey..it's a family car"
It’s American made, of course there is going to be plastic lmfao
I love this car, but this person’s car is ugly.
This thing has 797 hrsprs... that's basically 800 *BAD, BUFF HORSES* under the hood! *_MO POWA BABEH!!!_* Wait... wrong channel.
Crazy sedan
*World’s Fastest Production Sedan
Dear Doug, you look like you have more than two cars show us, and do a quirks n ft on them 😂
Car companies: we are trying to go green and eliminate pollution.. we should go electric.    Dodge: YES, BUT DID I MENTION OUR CHARGER HAS 787HP!!!!?!?!
Wait..wait..wait.. cars have automatic windshield wipers!
That exhaust sound is kinda scary...i like it.
Why are the license plates always Michigan🤔???!?
For 90k, gimme a c8
That's ugly
Why does Dodge make 2 muscle cars instead of focusing on 1?
The rear end  looks cheap and lame.
it only does 0 to 60 in 3.5 lol.
Never understood why someone wants to buy a government official car....
That thing looks so cheap and ugly
The power boost between these two generations is as much if not more than my Miata makes total
I can see star spangled banner out of the exhaust note
Anyone else watch dodge videos even tho you know about the car already
You just gave that car a great nickname... the PB&J.
looks like a 2019 car
8:50 he didn’t- he didn’t do the thing😔
2020 Alpina B7 is a Faster Sedan. Grated by 1 mph but it is faster according to google.
i know your knees hurt
fastest sedan on earth?...doesn't Koenigsegg have a faster sedan???😕
This car is the embodiment of “rocketship assembled by the lowest bidder”.
I’m waiting for the pink eye version
YES! As a charger owner we don’t care about the little things! More POWA!!! Its actually impressive how you knew that!!
1 877 cars and bids, Sell off your car today
as a police officer I love that the door opens so wide, i'm 6'5" and need the room to get out.
meh
Boom'd out
6:00 it is me or this new dodge charger red eye could really hit the 220 miles per hour?
Peanut butter inside, outside yellaaaay
If you want performance, just get C8 Corvette, if you want something nice get the Cadillac CTS-V. Doesn't matter what engine you put on the charge or how sporty it looks, at the end it's a charger,  just a plain and simple car.
Did they fix the cheap interior? You know the one where the dash and door panels lift after a while.
It's a 10 second sedan for under $100k with a warranty. What more could you ask for? Also, that paint and interior package should be called Peanut Butter and Jelly.
Finally they put the aggressive wheels back on them.
Peanut butter jelly car wtf
I want 🙋🏾‍♂️
*23k interior
Dodge is literally the coolest brand, however, you are paying 60000 for performance in a 20000 dollar car
This car is for rich peeps
Make a Grand Caravan to 10 seconds from the factory. That’s one only thing I can think of that’d impress me at this point.
Shit I love my 19 hellcat charger. Shit the srt seats are fucking awesome they are like a recliner. Shit I love them
Doesn't have a wireless charger because every time you step on the throttle, the phone would end up in the back seat if not plugged in.
It's not the fastest sedan 0-60 guaranteed.  All that HP will guarantee no traction without AWD.
Endless money pit
world's fastest sedan? ok so your forgetting Lamborghini, Porsche, Maserati, Mercedes, and Ferrari all make 4 door supercars right, that are faster and handle better than a charger
All the features Doug complains about not having do not matter
my 1999 civic is faster then this pos
ugliest exterior i’ve ever seen in my life
90k for an engine.
"fastest sedan on the planet" = 9/10 Doug Points for Acceleration......okidoki mate
Yay! You can drive it so fast, that when you crash, you just vaporize.
It’s a peanut butter and jelly hellcat red eye
I'd love to get one of these to replace my Fiat "browneye"...
Regarding the door, nope not crazy.  Have you seen the girth on some the folks driving these things?
Yeah this is the problem with this car you are paying over 90k for just engine the inside of the car sucks I understand the loving the engine but you should have at least a 30k inside so when the fire department cuts me out of it I can enjoy it during the process
This guy doesn't know the supra comes 1000hp stock
I personally would LOVE to see a Hellcat Redeye Magnum wagon!!!!! Let's get er done Dodge!!!!
“It can go over 200 mph”  British people: 😐 British people when the bottom said 320 kph: 🤯

Best part of these cars is that most sit on the lot for 4 months or more, and you can get one for 73k.
Maybe top speed, but pretty sure the m5 comp and p100d are the fastest sedans
Doug wrecked one before iykyk
I personally like the lack of features. Less things to go wrong while cutting cost.
i got the matching frame from lenscrafters, its only right i cop dis now
Think my 95 accord got a chance🤣
I work for Chrysler and I’d rather have a BMW M4

11:30 - fwiw, a .02 cents from a now 3x Charger owner:  In 2018, we moved from the midwest all the way to Seattle for a job relocation. Our '14 Charger RT was put on a trailer for transport, but we drove our '18 Scat Pack. In November weather. Stuffed to the gills with luggage and some critical items the movers couldn't (or shouldn't for valuation purposes) move.  The Scat Pack interior is pretty much the same as what you just reviewed on this redeye (though with black seats instead of tan). But our Plum Crazy monster carried us flawlessly the entire way, through warm and freezing weather, through flat highway and twisty mountain curves, and all while returning a trip avg of 24mpg.  Like you said, Doug, I could have gotten more luxury or refinement at the price point of even our Scat Pack. But to do all of the things above and still have 485hp under the hood - and look hecking rad doing it? Sign me up again, Dodge.
dodge 2030: dodge charger satan 1800 hp
The BMW m8 competition sedan would wax this thing, so no it's not the fastest sedan
Tell that to the BMW M5 competition
The old Dodge/Plymouth purple is Plum Crazy
The muscle car owners: Don’t show the power show the image  Doug: agreed and makes sense
Imagine a mid engine charger
Tesla Model S plaid?
It's not as bright as Plum Crazy, but I gotta admit that Hellraisin color looks slick as heck!  Aw jesus, not that tan interior! UGH
If you have time to look at, or worry about the interior, you're not driving this car fast enough.
As Emperor Palpatine once said: *UNLIMITED POWAAAAHH!!!!*
Acceleration wise a few EV's got this beat.
if you wanna drive this car "normally"...
The official car of criminals and guys with chin goatees.
Then you had to show that ugly, stupid SUV....
Stage 2 Audi S8: Hold my beer
Thanks for the review Doug
Damn...too bad it looks like ass
Fastest sedan? Isn't the Tesla Model S Plaid a sedan?  As fast top speed, and faster 0 to 60.

THIZZZZZZZ...Doug you need to get a new intro. I can't stand one more THIZZZZZZZ
This is the reason why I love working for dodge. Crazy shit like this
"This is the fastest sedan on the planet"  Konigsegg Gemera has entered the chat...
But have they fixed their cheap electric parts? 🤔
a dodge intrepid with a big engine stuffed in it..... brilliant.  If you absolutely must have one... just wait. These things will loose half there value in only 2 years of use.
That car be peanut butter and jelly spec lol
Anyone else completely unimpressed by Dodge’s dated lineup?
Put some Mickey Thompson tires at the back and problem solved.
Hmm Redeye... so it's the gunslinger cylon from the 70's.
Really??!! 😂😂😂😂you can't reach the door
I want mines in blue with an air suspension kit and a intake mod along with a tune and an exhaust mod
Still wouldn’t pay anything over 9k for any dodge. DONT GAS IT TO MUCH THE TRANSMISSION MIGHT BREAK EVERY BAND!!!
Wrong, these little things do make a difference when you spending 90k+ Sounds like you just tryna promote American cars, but yeah
...amazing how he missed a "mo powa behbeh" moment
Chewed by Ferrari 812.  get facts straight.  US is not "The World".  Next...!!!
Wait Doug’s lives In Charlotte?
Remember its a muscle car tho not luxury
In existence, or in the US?  Remember the US isnt "The World".
In what world do you live in? Only about 15 or 16 saloons are faster then this but ok
I order a challenger wide body, I can't be more excited for it to arrive.
Canadian muscle.
2021 Tesla Model S Plaid?
The Tesla Plaid will eat it alive.
Drop the durango video im so exited to see your opinion on it

At first i misread the title as "... the WORST fastet Sedan" lol
A purple dump truck with 800 hp
Its a peanut butter and grape jam sandwich.
Fastest in the world and then comes a turn...
I’ll gladly eat a peanut butter and jelly after buying this car
It looks a lot like Audi.
It's insane that the original hellcats are getting close to sub-40k... Talk about performance on a budget... You're paying like $50-60 per horsepower
ZZZZIS is the dodge charger
feels like they're designing these for bankrobbers and illegal street racing 😂😂😂
Doug’s knees are made of Adamantium...
Doug is the type of guy to put raisins on his peanut butter 🤦‍♂️
Soooo, Hellcat Redeye; 797HP and a top speed of 203MPH...huh  *looks at E60 M5*  Only 500HP, came out 15 years earlier, but with a de-restricted top speed of 205MPH...2 higher than the Redeye.  World's Fastest Sedan, my ass.
only a hellcat red eye will bring a grown man down to his knees
Why have American Cars such childish names xd Redeye, Demon, Hellcat....this is how i would have named a car when i was 8 lol
this car need Rolls Royce power door. Acura, Lexus, Volvo... wish they can sell sedan this expensive with this kind of quality
Mmmmm that hell raisin looking good!  Widebody looks best on the charger vs challenger
browneye
Fastest?  As in top speed?  Because I'm sure my car will get to 60 before this will.
Great car. The interior isn’t that bad. Seats are great. Lots of features, such as numerous customizable settings for the steering, suspension, etc.   No, I wouldn’t order purple and tan with orange calipers — but there are some great color combos available.
Before black boxes and GPS the fastest car on the planet was your courtesy car from insurance
Dodge need to drop AWD in these cars
bro what are the engineers at dodge doing? 800 hp holy shittttr
Awd for 10k
Doug What other quirky Cars did you drive in the Charlotte area?
Unlimited POWAH!!!
Sounds ok 👌 but the real muscle car sound it ain't outrageous price tag for basically just motor.
I like the wheel design.  The gear stick is very cool.  Everything else looks astonishingly bad.  The tail light is an almost exact copy of 2017 Hyundai Grandeur's.

Fastest sedan.. thats such incredible bullshit. The 2008 bentley continental flying spur speed had a vmax of 322kmh.  There are many many sedans which are faster around corners and a long list of cars with more power and a higher vmax. Almost all european. Ever heard of brabus and gpower btw?
that is one angry eggplant
9:57 rly did that in front of a cop
Purple fruit themed exterior, and a peanut butter interior? So basically this car is a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Brown interior to match the crap in ur pants 💩
Has anyone here actually used his website?
how does a hellcat only get a fun factor of 7?
this thing isn’t the fastest sedan with 320km/h, it’s the Bentley Flying Spur with 333km/h
Trash quality, Terrible engine, but 800 horse's , the car for the POSERS!
Isn't Tesla model s the fastest sedan?
It's peanut butter and jelly
What about the gt86s?

laught in Jaguar XE Project 8
This car is too fast for its own good.
With all that torque you think a phone is going to stay on a wireless charger 😂
I love the shirt Doug. Xj gang
Wait u in Charlotte
Durango flex
Would still rather whip the Amg gt63s.. no disrespect to dodge it’s just a different class
Its funny how you said you can rent this car at any Alamo airport rental at any airport. I rented the R/T version of this car at the Fort Myers Alamo rental in November of 2018 where I spend about one month every year since 2015 and it was so much fun to drive. It had a button on the dash marked "Sport" and when you pressed it the active exhaust would allow the engine to make cool noises. I took that car for a drive on the i75 to Fort Lauderdale to visit my friend who lives there from my condo in Cape Cora and it was fast but I was surprised that it wasn't as fast at higher speeds like above 60 MPH especially from my modified 2012 Infiniti G37xS Coupe (Made in Japan for the Canadian Market). I had trouble keeping up with an Acura MDX who was probably going between 80 and 85 MPH. Truth is I didn't want to drive much above the speed limit but that MDX was fast. I love the sound that car made in my Condo's 4 floor garage. I even got compliments from the tenants on how muscle car like it sounded in Sport mode. If I came home later than 10 PM I would turn off sport mode as courtesy to my neighbours but in during the day I had fun. It had a lot of low end torque which was fun on many of the roads in our area as the speed limits run from 30, 40, 45, 50 and 55 MPH without hitting the main highway i75 and at those speeds, that car was at it's sweet spot the car and it was a beast and fun to drive. However the caveat was that with fun came more trips to the gas station. Even though the gas prices were much lower than my home in Montreal, QC it was still annoying to have to watch the gas gauge. The interior was surprisingly comfortable. Last year I drove my G down to Cape Coral and fully expected to drive it back to Montreal after leaving there during the winter while having my friend who lived across the street drive it once a week to keep her running. I was planning on taking the Auto Train from Orlando to Virginia which is about a 3 hour drive and then a 9.5 hour drive from VIrginia back to Montreal. My G has never seen a winter and I used to store it under my winter car shelter under a car cover while using an intelligent car charger however in retrospect instead of renting a car for almost a month in November and then again for 10 days in April and then 21 days in May and driver her back in May using the Auto Train. This is what I should've done because truly the roads in Florida are truly amazing compared to the terrible roads in and around Montreal; potholes, crevices, cracks, sunken manhole covers, indentations in the road, missing road surfaces, construction gravel, dirt and debris in the spring, and expansion joints in the elevated highways and bridges; you get the picture. The only thing I have against this car is that the design is dated and Dodge needs a new design. The one disappointment with this review and it's a major one, is that I think you should've taken it out on the highway and driven it on a track.
Peanut butter jelly 😂😂
hm i thought the inside was nice and modern minus cruise control:/
What are you getting about 7 to 8 mpg?
That thang ugggggggullllllyyyyy
Love the interior!
ugly
imagine speeding on a freeway in a 392 challenger thinking youre probably safe from being chased by any regular trooper's charger  and then you see *this* light you up
Throw a cam in it and and exhaust ... holy ..
its not a dodge unless they make the motor covering look like a metal lunchbox
Making and selling a car in the U.S. that reaches 200 mph should be a crime. We should stop this madness. These things are killing people for entertainment purposes. No first responders want to scrape up remains with a shovel and clean the gore off the highway with a firehose. Its as disturbing as any war zone. Enough of this. Lets start bragging about how safe our driving is and how much we care about human life.
that interior is comical
Need to put one out with the helaphant lmao why? Cause MURICA😂
can I get a MO POWA BABEH!
THE GOAT
What about you buy a basic model charger and then buy the hellcat engine and switch the engine
You expect Dodge to put a wireless charger IN the Charger ?
Your mic/audio made my head hurt this whole video
"purple over peanut butter! That's not a combination you'll ever see again!"  - Tell that to my PB and J sandwich
It's the fully automatic military style assault weapon of the car world. It shouldn't be sold to civilians. It should only be sold to professional drivers.
My hats off to the team at Dodge for making an amazing car. I’ve rented plenty of Chargers, including Charger Daytona’s. Even the base models are fun to drive. I can only imagine how cool the Hellcat is.
Doug is the type of guy who would bid on his own car at a car auction
Where's the link to the widebody?
Legit not sure how any car can compete against a model s performance for overall tech, speed, price, comfort and looks.
You know the car has some power when even Doug if afraid to lay into it. Or when he uses dangerous in the reference to its power.
Real men like performance all that other crap is for the chicks we pile in.....
Nice car but I’ll take the challenger srt Hellcat Redeye Widebody over the charger
Rev ur engines
Only Doug would complain that a Redeye doesn’t have adaptive cruise control 😂
I just picked a 2020 Hellcat redeye widebody in Go Mango and love it
I absolutely don't want one of these, except, I kinda want one.
I literally have the same pair of ASICS you have.
You can't really USE "800hp" to 2 wheels though.  There are probably cars with half the horsepower, but with AWD, that could beat it off the line -- especially in the wet.
how does the charger have the same daily score as the demon
Shame it's not AWD
Chrysler actually makes cars America’s want.
I can’t even imagine driving this thing. Even the production model R/T is so fun to drive, just wish they had it with AWD
$90k and it looks like the most tacky dressed up dodge 4 door sedan i've ever seen. Money can't buy taste
If you're going to spend close to $100,000 for 4-door sedan buy a BMW M5...
I'm pretty sure the doors open that far because the car is also used as a police interceptor. They probably designed it so police can shelter behind them for cover.
Best to watch on mute- dude trying to hard!!!!!!!!
Lmao its doug talking shit about the cheap glove box latch for me 😭😂
Chrysler interiors are cheap, the profit margin for the company is very good on these cars even with a powerful engine. Warranty? Not for long I bet.  UGLY car, attractive power.
goes over 200 mph so it also needs very good brakes to take the off ramp to the gas stations. Never considered 4 door sedans as sports cars. For the guy who can't or not allowed to have a second car. When your kids turn 16 and want the keys, does it have a limp mode so you'll have your kids grow to adult age?
200 mph, at 140 that car feel like a boat on the road, all those miles after are all for shows
Cool if you have kids. Give me a 68-70 charger instead.
Doug. The front door was designed to open that wide for Law Enforcement Chargers.
When will Dodge update interior and electronics
This gives me flashbacks to when Doug almost crashed the other Hellcat
This guy talks like Donald duck.. "Thissss PffFFf Is a Dodge"
audi: rich saddle leather douggie fresh: penut boter
I never understand why people try to explain acceleration in terms of horsepower. It has more torque. That's why it feels faster. Horsepower equates to top speed when quantified against other variables such as weight and drag.
Doug says 'fastest stock production sedan, you can buy,'  meanwhile suggested links on the side stock Tesla beats Dodge Red Eye again and again in 1/4 mil lol
quit waving your arms around like a spastic and repeating yourself.  Just get on with it.
It's a shame that it doesn't have standard safety features and the interior design isn't all that fresh or new 🤦🏽‍♂️
The color for sho 👌🏽🔥❤
The wheels are awesome 👌🏽💯🔥
Great review bro!
I’m loving that color and the wheels. They did a good job with this one. Well done Dodge.
Over 80 grand and they can’t bother to paint the hood? Nice.
alright, it's official: dodge is America's #1 performance brand
Doug: Rear view camera is poor quality. Me: What's behind me is of no concern.
Bang for the buck and style that Appeals to the eye, better than the Challenger. Just needs all wheel drive.
I feel like the car is full of the exaggerated swagger of a black teen
It’s a muscle
Yup
imagine if this becomes new police cruiser for 2021
It's a sedan but no mention of the rear passenger experience?🤔
No no no! Better materials, better seats, better system, etc :)))) It may be the fastest sedan, but not even in the running for the Best! Just compare to an M5 Competition....this doesnt even have AWD to put all that power down...I mean come on its 2020, tell the engineers to use google more :)))))
Dodge cant really say MADE IN AMERICA...its all China parts apart from engine :D :D
dodge porko hameye
Next will be the "DODGE CHARGER SRT DEMON"  or the "DODGE DEMON" 3rd gen
“Fastest sedan in the world”: 203 MPH Flying Spur: 207 MPH
In North Carolina with Minnesota tag? 🤔
Mr. Organik said he had the only one
Guessing the weirdness with the door has to do with their police contracts, because the angle on Pursuit Chargers tends to be greater than most cars to allow for a duty belt. I would imagine it’s uniform across the model line now.
i like how the paint matches the coolant colour
I want one !!
Ahhh I miss Charlotte
10:35: man I hope pour olive survives the pandemic.
You and ratile rides should make a video together
What is this midnight purple looking paint, gold brembos wide fenders like a JDM car. I guess American cars just suck so bad anymore they just copy off Imports. Muscle cars are stupid anyway just another piece of crap ford or dodge with an oversized obnoxious v8 in a smaller car nothing cool or special about the actual car. Still to this day all muscle cars sound the same have boring interior and boring exterior. Demons and hellcats are stupid fast but still not as cool as most foreign cars with half the power.
The Bentley Flying Spur is the fastest production sedan as it has a top speed of 207 mph.
Am I the only one who feels that the colour combination on this car looks absolutely satisfying.
Tesla performance model has entered the chat
How is this fastest sedan in the world? For example brabus 800 e63 goes well over 335kmh gps, offcourse its tuned version of amg, same with the dodge, tuned version of regular srt, and its slower.
ahh... now I get the two tshirts.  gynecomastia
Love these cheap plastic comments What production car under 100k has good quality plastic for the knobs and switches?
Peanut butter jelly time car
Again it's a performance car, not a luxury car.
_27??!_
8:50 *MORE POWERRRR*
Dodge makes me want to study for school
Only car with that shitty interior that could fly for 90k
If it's anything like the Durango (and I bet it is), there is an option for rain sensing wipers in the screen. You just leave the stalk in the on position.
No adaptive cruise? Jesus even my 300 has it
more power! features are for mindless housewives that cant drive.
Are you going to review the super stock ??
Was anyone else  waiting for Doug to hit a donut media sayin....A MOOO POOWWWAAHHH BABBYYY
That's a beautiful color combination!!! I love it!!!
I would like one for Christmas 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼please 🎅 I will be forever grateful
3:13 POGGERS DOUG
Car is ugly as HE**! WAY OVERPRICED
Lasts 'til 200mph or 67k miles, whichever comes first:)
$90,000 I get it in 6 years for $35,000 or less.
Did he just compare a 30+ year old car to a 2021 car
That’s a pretty fast boat
Dodge has lost their damn mind. You’re talking close to 100k for some 2007 Dodge Dart interior. You can get yourself an AMG for less, or maybe 30 grand more but you get way more than this shit.
You forgot about Bentley Flying Spur. 333 km/h!
Shockingly few quirks and features
Doug, I know that for $90k you should get all of that stuff, I agree. Dodge does offer most of those options in lower level Chargers. R/Ts, & Scat Packs have optional adaptive cruise, rain-sensing wipers, fog lights etc for much less than $90k. FCA says the additional cooling needed for the supercharged engine outweighs the need for the fog lights and adaptive sensors.
Pb&J colored car
AWD , dodge please!!!
Brabus rocket 800
this guy is so cringe.
I hate the purple
Isn't the fastest sedan on the planet, the 2020 Bentley Flying Spur? It'll do 207 mph. THIS.... will "only" do 203 mph.
If Chrysler ask me what to improve in a $10k budget, *A FRONT AXLE WITH THE V8* I don't want a Jeep nor Durango, just have a small size sedan with SRT power and All Wheel Drive
I wouldn't get all the options Doug was complaining about the Red eye not having. It's just more shit to go wrong.
Nice fast car. But they depreciate really bad.
200 years later: What were Doug’s last words?! Everyone: it was *don’t forget to check out cars and bids* !!!
Charlotte!!!
Ummm i think you mean,  They would say: MO POWA BABY
Who cares it's pretty much a damn race car all that stuff ur knocking isn't IMPORTANT
Im still saving up for mine. I really hope they soon give the interior some love.
adaptive cruise is actually on lower trims which is weird
where was this filmed? those houses are beautiful
i refuse to call that thing a sedan
moo powa baby!!!
I ordered a Charger Redeye on the first ordering day September 4th and it should be here within the next month or 2. it will be first Charger Redeye in the mid south
My 2011 RT has adaptive cruise control; I wonder why they wouldn't include it in this charger?
No its not ever heard of brabus
Doug has never heard of Pnut butter & Raisins?
10 second quarter while weighing that much is so mad
Hey Doug we call that color combo peanut butter and jelly !!!
very nice car!
More like a 10k dollar interior lol
On the topic of the huge doors, we had a 2015 Charger Rallye, my wife (5'4") would use the spot between the top of the door trim and the window to pull the doors closed. With the legendary Chrysler Quality that did not turn out well, the top of the doors got deformed and pulled in.  On the topic of the Auto Cruise Control, that car had a very good setup for that, but it seems as you move up in the product levels that option begins to disappear. Also the Chrysler quality took that down multiple times with bad sensors and ABS controllers.
Man that is one terrible looking interior. I mean I understand Doug's point but would it kill FCA to give it a nice interior?
12:08 - is it just me - or do the front wheels look bigger than the rear?
I need the video of Durango
It's a four door !             😑
They build the car for tall people I don't have issues grabbing the door
Doug: "you won't find purple or peanut butter anywhere else......"   Hold my Rolls Royce
Waiting on that Durango hellcat doug! Come on with it
Is that stolen Durango Hellcat live on cars and bids yet?
Love the xj shirt. Legendary!
These cars are going for nearly $300k in Australia. WTF?
We need to buy this cars. Because ev is destroying all.
Color combo: peanut butter and jelly on pumpernickel bread.
Why is this on the second chanel?
Anyone else noticed how when he’s on his knees he’s still almost taller than the car lol
PB&J car!
6:36 sounds like bald eagles and freedom
MORE POWER
Me: Sees Hellcat in the title *Has Vietnam flashbacks 0_0
The color reminds me of Mopar purple Coolant.
The Americans know how to do it.  A four door saloon in the US: Is it... Refined? No Economic? No Pretty? No Fast? 200MPH!
Great, with this car you Americans can finally outrun COVID
Fastest sedan until it even so much as glimpses at a corner
8:25 a meme is born
Doug Demuro- the new spokesman for FCA (focusing on Dodge and Ram)
it doesn't even sound that good
And
I can buy  jeep trackhawk
Worth it
NOT
90k
Dum
How many people have died in these Cars, with 500hp+?  How about a Viper, with no door locks or windows? Not to mention, no roof.  Because, if you felt like it, you could just slap some numbers on the side of this car and go run a Nascar Race.
Inside peanut butter, outside jelly 😁
Loud, inefficient, shitty tech, cheap interior, looks meh, can't corner for shit...yea American cars still suck
Faster than a tesla?
All that power and all it can manage is 200mph
Sir, I am your fan from Philippines, and I wish you could review a supercar before the year ends
MO' POWA BABY
2020 Bentley FLying Spur does 207 MPH, and is the real fastest sedan in the World
Lol the glove box latch is the cheapest piece of Garbo, you called that straight up. Mine pops off every now and then lol.
03:37 xD
Satin hood, big no for that color hellraisin
I want Mopar to make available the hood scoop vent to the air filter! They make one for the challenger but only NOW do I see one for the charger...not on Mopar aftermarket parts yet.......waiting it should drop a little more cool air to my 5.7 intake now outside temp 70 after mixing on engine compartment intake temp is 77 to 79....baby LOVES COOL AIR!!!
That color combo is fucking good!!!
the hell cat reminds me of  pb&j when he said the interior is like pb
please review the 2021 BMW m5 , I really want to see your take on it
i feel like it can be a coincidence that he talks like jay leno
This nigga Doug damn near nut every time he floor it😂
Inside peanut butter outside jelly
Fastest car? E63 and M5 destroy this plastic shitbox
You could probably run lower 10s or high 9s stripped so who cares about interior lol
Your paying for the performance power not luxury
For 90k you can have a mp4-12c
Cars have automatic windshield wipers now??? But not automatic night lights?
Al Bundy is turning over his grave right now 😂 "da dodge"😂
A round of applause for FCA. They might have the quality control of a Chinese prison, but damn do they stuff some horses in their cars
Why do you have another channel if ur gonna fo the same thing? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Can we get a new challenger video, I’m interested in the super stock
None of the hellcats have adaptive cruise and thats due to the location of the sensor in the lower front grille restricts too much cooling according to FCA
I won't be surprised if they come out with 1000hp, like come on.
Just wait till dodge releases the ghoul so many people dont even know whats coming
normal people car
Doug hit nail on the head for $10k more the one thing I want is more power. Want a creature comfort car go to Mercedes.
That’s a sexy as fuck color. What is that, Merlin Purple?
Okay I have to 2015 Rally I had the 2017 Daytona and I also got the 2020 Scat Pack .when you open the doors and close them there is a handle at the top you grab that handle and then you reach for the door it's just that simple
@6:24 Hardly Davidson? 🤔
i thought i saw my friends house in the background and then he said he's in charlotte lol
I mean the OLD BMW M760Li goes 320kph so this car is not only NOT the fastest sedan because a comfortable luxury car has the same speed but just because an even more luxurious car the Bentley flying spur has a top speed of 340kph so it just isn’t the fastest sedan
First thing I'd do is get the hood painted.
Just...so....thrilling.... ***DOUG-GASM
This cars begs for someone to sing, "Peanut butter, jelly time! Peanut butter, jelly time!"
Impossible to take this car serious with that interior especially at that price point
Peanut 🥜 butter and Jelly
Tesla Model S P100D. 1/4 mile 10.4 seconds... And new version will be in 9s.. sorry this is not the fastest sedan in the world, maybe fastest ICE sedan.
1:14 key word: FOR NOW
Typical Chrysler, cheap plastic interior and horrible color combination.
The most carjacked vehicle in America. Also, if you aren't being carjacked in it, it's being stolen right out of your driveway.
Lol he mentioned the cameras. Nobody driving that doesn't know how to back it up lol
I would rather spend 50k on a 3 year old audi s8 performance and put a 20k tune on it to be faster and more luxurious
90k and u can get a 19 gtr.
Other automotive companies - "let's switch over to hybrids and electric cars to appeal the buyers and also save the planet in the process"   Doge/Chrysler - "HAHA HORSEPOWER GO BRRRRR"
Dodge in 2015: let’s make a car with 707 horsepower.  Dodge in 2020: LETS PUT 90 MORE HORSEPOWER IN THE SAME CAR!
This is like the Lancer Evo in the sense that it’s all power, no features. Tbh I don’t care about tech n stuff and materials.
Stradman would be proud
its not the fastest sedan on the planet.  the project 8 is.  this thing would get sauced up on a track.
I guess ur paying for power not luxury
800 horsepower and 200+ mp/h....who cares about the color combination 😄😄😄
You’re so passionate about cars and I love it and I would love you too if you were special like me.... hahaha ♥️🐻✝️🤙🏽   Thanks for an awesome video! God bless!
drove a 17’ Charger hellcat never will i own one most terrifying car i’ve driven the scat pack is a better daily

Its called peanut butter and jelly 😋 🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's crazy that car companies are now basically making the insane cars we and our friends would dream up when we were 13 and would try to outdo the next kid about how much horsepower and top speed we wanted.
Purple and brown/tan.  Pb and j
Peanut butter interior and jelly exterior
should of gave the option for awd. they give you the option of awd with the shitty v6 but not v8s that need the traction when u got over 700 hp
How come all these bad ass cars are always test driven by gay dudes?
10:59 Doug is the type of guy who drives out from a Dead End
How does it look with the front splitter protector still on?   Asking for a friend.
You gotta remember! When the Ferrari f40 came out it didnt have air condition, radio, no rolled down Windows, no carpeting, it was just spartan inside! Bare bone! Only a carbon fiber tub! But! And that's a big but! It had the looks, the handling, the power and suspension of a race car, and at that time that car was over 100k for it. I know! Its not a dodge! But way to expensive for the times, and now! They're worth a fortune! So if you hold on to that charger till the next 20 year's or more! Im pretty sure it will become one expensive collectible!
Who's the bigger asshole? A person  who would own this or a Hummer? No way this car can corner. Lol
You know the roots of a car are old when it still has flip up exterior door handles instead of pull handles...
All go no show! What?! You want both? Get an Aventador!
Can any one see this running longer than 20k
The ugliest $ 90,000 Dollar sedan
5:16 Peanut Butter seats plus Hell Raisin paint equals Peanut butter and jelly 😁💯
Ugly color but that car is a monster😍
But is it a rolling coffin like the Viper, and you forgot to talk about the supercharger whine
Damn
The wide body looks better.
This is the evo and STI of the muscle car community. Take the rental car and give it all the horse power.
The interior of dodge sucks thou huge fan of challenger either way
Doug is paid by the car manufacturers and is not a mechanic and will never say anything bad. Get the truth from Scotty Kilmer, not this salesman.
Nice Coronet.
What about the Flying Spur or Alpina B7? Aren't those faster sedans?
In other words.........it's a rental car with an 800hp engine.
Yeah dodge should definitely upgrade that interior for the hellcat thats crazy
Am I the I the only one saying “hell cat it’s an SRT”🤣🤣
I paid $65k for a 2 year-old loaded E63 AMG Designo and spent $3,500 to tune it to 750bhp.  Think I’d rather spend $20k less and have a car which is so nice inside and has every option.
That PoS will be worth half of it’s value in 3 years....vs 2 years.
It’s ugly AF.  If you don’t think so, you’re definitely American.  No offense.  Cool car though.
Mopar dudes and lambros and the same type of person
Sc has
Mopar? No Mopower
Is anyone else bored of this car yet? Don't get me wrong, the hellcats are great fun cars but they need to switch it up instead of just putting more horsepower that doesn't really translate into any real performance on the street. They really haven't made any significant changes in 7 years just the constant more horsepower and new paint colors lol. Also for almost 90k the least they could do is update the interior which is garbage for that price point
Honestly I think it’s well worth the 90 thousand dollars. It’s a 4 door sedan that has 800 hp and can go over 200mph. 🤷🏻‍♂️
*Chrysler must have paid somebody pretty penny?*
Sadly, it is still a Dodge, plagued by all the woes and ills of Chrysler.
90k for a car that when you close the door you hear that cheap ka-klunk
you have fun as long as you still have points on that lic.cheers
Still don't get why everyone keeps buying suvs and trucks and not cars sedans wagons hatches i remember cruising with parents in a 85 caprice wagon tons of room comfy seated 8 lol and got decent mpgs just one example I find it odd so many stopped building because people don't want them I find it strange
What about the new 2021 BMW m5 competition
Mopar baby
Shame they can't put that in the ol Magnum body since it's pretty much the same thing. A Merc and Audi shredding wagon would be epic.
The gas tank might as well be non existent 😂😂
You don't buy a redeye for creature comforts... you buy it for the engine.
Doesn't he remind you of Will Ferrell 🤣😂
Color combos are definitely for their target consumers which as we all know are comic book dealers.
"I'm in Charlotte"  Ayeee finally showing us some love 😎
The color combo makes perfect sense. Apparently Doug has never heard the phrase "Inside peanut butter, outside jelly."
So the Dodge Demon but more practical.
The reason the car doesn’t come with a wireless charger is because the car itself is a Charger.
Yeah that car will never run 10s straight from the factory and that’s a fact
I got in. Redeye and it had a wireless connection
Ohhh Boy ...
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos ⭕️
What about Dodge demon
you deserve a better interior camera doug
It's at work of art.... No the average consumer can go to the racetrack
Tesla: you hear something?
Kinda... tired of these ... already ....
More Powaaaaa baby
what’s the mpg like? would it make a good daily driver?
Mo power baby 😂
The S65 Brabus 900 rocket has a top speed of 350km/h. So not the fasest sedan, still awesome tho       Diese Kommentar Sektion is nun Eigentum der Bundesrepublik Deutschland.
I wonder Doug give her wife a Doug score
$90k for power👎🏽. Interior needs more and maybe a manual.
his explanation of price vs power at 9:00 is perfect.    Corvette has been screaming this for about 25 years now.
ugly, just like the other new chargers
PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD EVER DO AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES ARE YOU 100% SURE THAT IF YOU DIED TODAY THAT YOU WOULD GO TO HEAVEN? (CLICK 'READ MORE')  There are some things that you should know:  1. Realize that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior:  Ro 3:23 "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"  Ro 3:10 "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"  It all began when the first humans, Adam and Eve were created and God put them in the garden of Eden. God created them perfect to live in fellowship with Him. There was no death or sorrow. God told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed God and as a result, sin entered into the world. The pain, which this world sees, is the result of sin.  2. Because of our sins, we die both spiritually and physically, but God sent His Son to die so that you can have a chance not to have to go to hell by accepting what He did on the cross:  Ro 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."  Ro 5:8 "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."  Every person who has ever lived is a sinner and is not righteous because we do bad things. A sin is a crime against God, just as if you steal something at the store, it is punishable by going to jail. It's the same thing with sin. Lying, stealing, sex before marriage, pride, hatred, ect. are all sins. Hell is a prison for those who commit crimes against God. That’s because you must be perfect in order to get to heaven. No matter how well you live your life from then on, you have already sinned, which will be punished if you are not pardoned. If you commit a crime, and then live as a good citizen you still will go to jail for the crime you committed. Right? Just as the President can pardon a crime so you won't go to jail, Jesus can pardon your sins so that you do not go to hell, and can go to heaven when you die. You won’t have to pay for your own sins because Jesus already did that for you. But if you reject the pardon that He offers, you will have to pay for your own sins by going to hell.  3. If you will confess Jesus Christ as Your Lord, place your Faith in Him and Believe in your heart that He died, shed His blood and rose again as a sacrifice for your sins, you will be saved (from hell).  Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.   Heb 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  You cannot get to heaven by being a good person, going to church, baptism or any other way other than by turning to Jesus, believing in your heart that He died on the cross and rose from the dead for your sins and placing your Faith in Him. While these are good things to do, some people believe that they will get to heaven, but your Faith must be in Christ and His sacrifice alone and nothing else, giving your life to Him.   Eph 2:8,9 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.  Ro 10:9,10;13 "that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved..For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."  4.  You must submit your life to Jesus Christ and His will in Faith, believing in your heart that He died and rose again shedding His blood to pay for your sins as a sacrifice to God.  If you want to accept Jesus free gift of salvation, or if you have any doubts about whether or not you are going to heaven, HUMBLY PRAY THIS PRAYER TO GOD FROM YOUR HEART IN FAITH:  ”Dear Lord Jesus I know that I  am a sinner and need you to save me.  I believe that You are the Lord and believe in my heart that You died on the Cross and Rose from the dead, shedding your blood as a Sacrifice for my sins.  I turn to You as the only way of salvation, I submit my life to you, I submit my will to yours, I place my Faith and Trust in You alone as Lord of my life, Please save me and I thank You for it, in Jesus holy name, Amen.”  If you have truly placed your faith in Jesus Christ as your Lord, submitting your life to Him, you can know that you are a child of God and on your way to heaven.  Now that you are on your way to heaven, you should attend a bible believing church and follow in baptism...
Why doesn't this thing have AWD in any V8 trim?
Peanut butter and jelly
Ants on a Log
And it’s cheaper than a Ferrari
where can you drive that fast and get away with it, without anything stupid happing
That’s peanut butter jelly
Definitely time for an interior upgrade. Smh
Hello doug,i have a question..does bid means money?? (In your website) or what people do its that they rent the car??
charger xr is faster
no it's not, tell the truth Doug, Tesla is much faster. The Model S Tesla Raven with Cheetah Stance is much faster & better for the environment.
That car has the same cheap buttons and stalks as my wife's Chrysler Pacifica.  Not impressed. I could build a waaaaayy better car for $90k
So when does the V-tec kick in yo??
Ugh cheap plastics in the car..... But 797HP!
That color combo is Peanut Butter & Jelly
He gettin thick
Doug I missed watching a few of your videos. Did you put on some weight? Lol
Great car now just needs an awd option
Who cares once you get over 150? Quickest is where it’s at
Who da hell name these cars? red ass, blue wing, green mouth?
Nothing is faster than a rental.
Doesn’t this have AWD
Man that thing makes the best sound in the world
I have a v6 charging with the “hellraisin” color and i love it cant wait to upgrade
That color is the worst IMO. But it’s an amazing car. I had a 2016 hellcat. Loved it.
All of a sudden, I'm in the mood for PB&J for some reason...
Hellcat Pacifica anyone?
Im from the uk and im a big american muscle car fan just love the v8 sound them things give off the only draw back is they dont believe in all wheel drive in which that lets them down you car'nt have 700-800 bhp at the wheel with only rear wheel drive it just wont work.for example a nissan 3.5 gtr Litchfield produce 650 bhp 0-60 in around 2.6 seconds and reach around 210 mph so stick all wheel drive in your dodge.camero.mustangs then there in the same super car category
Do the 2021 Hellcat Challenger next!!
Let’s start a MO POWA BABY chain
Inside peanut butter, outside jelly.... yeah I know that song was about Chevy’s but it still works.
The only interesting feature is the engine power. The rest is so outdated  . .
If that car costs $90,000 from the factory the person buying that car most likely will not be able to buy it for less than $120,000 with the dealership premium that Dodge dealerships like to add on to the price of cars like that. I'm surprised that Doug didn't mention that in his video.
Or a AWD MODEL because the POWER is in the back tires not the front
Dodge just needs to stop being cheap... like all Scat packs and up need to have LEDs, up to date technology, and how about we do away with Cloth Seats like Forever!
Stop self promoting, it sucks
An 800 horsepower Dodge. Im sure there will be zero reliability issues in a few years....Or months
Great review.....I’m glad that he mentioned how dangerous this car can be. It’s a not a first drivers car. I know someone in Chicago that bought it and took it back after 5 days. He told me he couldn’t control it over 70. BUT it will be a great cat to collect.
Did they really match the engine coolant with the body color?
I'm a sex trafficking victim who has been raped and brainwashed by my family since I was a teenager. They have attempted to murder me. I have mental illness because of what they did to me. It feels like I am being constantly abused by them. They are trying to force me to commit suicide. They are trying to wear me down until my character has diminished. I don't understand what life is like for normal adults and I am ineffective at trying to fit in. Please don't misunderstand me or what is going on with me. I have no understanding of life itself. They have destroyed my brain with torture. I have tried to call the police but they don't believe me. I have talked to the federal government as well but I have heard nothing back from them. I can't even comprehend how upset I should be about this, I do not understand what it's like for normal people. I should be more mad, I should be fighting harder for my life but I am growing tired. I have already exhausted many options. I have become hopeless. Please check out my music channel and donate to me.

Dodge 🤮
Everyone: saddle brown interior Doug: peanut butter!
After all that it's still a Dodge
And it will last for an entire year before it has some catastrophic engine or trans failure
Imagine Doug with Trump’s voice. The same dialogue, just Trump’s voice. Idk how, but it still somewhat works.
M5 will still beat it on normal roads 😂
So in 2022  Charger SRT Hellcat Super Stock !! Stop the milking pleaaaaase !!!
Love this PB&J hellcat
I like the Charger over the Challenger. I love it's aggressive looks.
How much!
The gauge cluster is circled in red for red eyes... Get it? 😎
The only good thing about the car is the exterior and the engine. You can forget the quality of the interior and the tech.
Why on the 2nd channel?
Yes sir this is the fastest sedan
Peanut flavored black n mild
This has nothing to do with the video...But I want to WARN you all in 💝. Please everyone choose Jesus as your Lord and Savior. All these natural disasters are lining up with Bible prophecy in Rev. We are getting closer to Jesus's return and judgement coming on the entire world. Please all repent with your mouth to God and admit we need a Savior Jesus Christ who died for all our sins. Believe and have faith in Jesus Christ and how he died on the cross for our sins and rose again. Invite the Holy Spirit ( being baptized ) into your life and turn from your sins. For those who don't repent and choose Jesus's gift of dying on the cross so we can have eternal life.. Things won't go well for them. I don't want to see anyone perish. I love you all, why I'm warning everyone daily and praying for the entire 🌎 daily. God bless you all!! I'm a sinner and I'm so grateful Jesus saved me from perishing. I keep seeking him daily and his commandments and they aren't burdensome, instead I have peace even when the world seems to be falling apart. God is on the throne, amen!!🙏🙏💐💝💝😊
THIS is a hunk of shit.
Other than the sound, cars like this are becoming increasingly pointless. Other than for very narrow and specific use cases they're simply not on top anymore. For more than $20k less you get a Model 3 Performance which will smoke this in every conceivable REAL-WORLD condition: it's way quicker, MUCH grippier on any road, and the Dodge will always be the one the cops stop in a road race because it's the really loud one. And while the the Model 3 is no luxury car, the Dodge redefines cheap interior. But if you want a loud engine and screaming tires, by all means get this sucker.
Doug, the wide door openings allow for easier handicapped entrance. From experience.
Here's where you're incorrect. I would definitely upgrade my interior and get adaptive cruise control for the extra 10 G's along with other upgrades.   Why the fuck would I go for more power when I already 800 HP and I probably won't use majority of it on typical streets. With 800 I'm signing up to die and anymore than that is just reckless and idiotic. Don't assume you know the buyers. Review your cars. Other than that stfu.
Cts v goes 203mph
Oh look... a fast Fiat!
Technically the Bentley flying spur is the fastest sedan
The four door family car is so fast now. Wah wah wah
What the he'll are your ads set to? Watched 2 to let it start & 2 more came up ... just 2 mins in. WTH Dougy?
It is nice. But id rather have a zr1
MORE POWER BABY
They don’t put adaptive cruise on Charger HC because the front grill sensor blocks too much cooling air flow. My HC doesn’t have it but my lower model 392 Charger does have it optioned.
Top speed of the BMW Alpina B7 is 205 mph. I’d s a tuner company but still a sedan that can be ordered at BMW...at 2x the price though.
C'mon Doug, a '$40k interior'.....there's $20k Mazdas with interiors 3x nicer than this thing.
You know it’s insanely fast when Doug doesn’t get on the highway to step on the throttle
John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  Repent and turn from sin! Follow God's sacred 10 Commandments! Time is running out!
Its the peanut butter and jelly edition 🤣
Hits different when you realize it’s faster than a rari😳
Not the type of car that I would like really not enough good features but still can get you around
Why does the demon get a 10 in acceleration and this only a 9?
Its the perfect dad car
This is the most beautiful purple ever
There are people that do care about speed and quality of interior. I’ll wait and pray that AMG makes an equally outrageous E63s.
That interior excuse is lame. The TRX has power and a nicer interior. I got tired of my scat pack after a year because the interior quality felt awful, the tech package and sunroof couldn’t save it for me.   If RAM can have really nice interior in their trucks dodge can do better than this.
You came to Charlotte and didn’t come say hi???
World fastest? In a straight line? Lets see if that can go around the Nordschleife and survive?
I wouldn't trust charger on 200mph
Dodge is really milking this cow
Ugh. Wait. How about Tycan Turbo S?
Cheap plastic, cheap materials, lack of features, bad infotainment, too much horsepower, unsafe, too loud, For more than $80,000. Nope
doug: the charger hellcat redeye is the fastest sedan  m5: am i a joke to you ?
The Charger definitely needs an remodel but the engine doesn't
i don’t care about all the tech features, i want mo powa baby
Peanut butter and jelly color

If it was only AWD 😔
Can't wait to see the Tesla model s plaid shit on this thing
It's all about the SMILES per gallon...............
Inside peanut butter, outside jelly, seven days of the week, seven different hemis (not chevys) 😎😎😂😂
Cheap junk with a cheap powertrain and a big supercharger=this car.
It feels dodge is going back to its 60's / 70's roots of making it stupid fast at all cost, reliability comes second
I find the automatic windshield wiper issue hard to believe. On the ram, you get them. My 2015 Laramie has them. Click them on once and it automatically changes the speed of the wipers depending on how hard it rains. I really doubt a 2021 hellcat doesn’t have them
Yea that’s why I’m just going to swap my v6 charger to my a Hellcat charger. I’ll pay 80k-90k  for a luxury car.
This is fast But not the fastest, the dodge demon SRT is faster. Pushing 852 stock horsepower with the speed key that unlocks full power.
Mo' powah babeh!
" is the fastest sedan in the world...1/4 10.6 sec "  Porsche: * fake coughs * pardon me...
Automatic windshield wipers are a thing?
Damn that's a nice ass car just being honest
What a machine!!!💪💪😃
Fun Fact: The Bently Flying Spur is faster at 207 mph
Bmw M5 E60 with removed limiter: *allow* *me* *to* *introduce* *myself*
the Peanutbutter & Jam spec! I likes it B^D
Inside peanut butter, outside jelly
Cap on that
Nice   Keep making em short
My Toyota Camry can beat this boat
When entering a vehicle, I always open the door fully. I then step around it, sit firmly in the seat, and close the door behind me.   Cross this one off the shopping list...
That supercharger is retardedly big
КТО ИЗ РАШКИ
why you running
You know Doug fell off when he’s reviewing a Dodge Charger redeye 🤣
Challenger is better
Once stalantuis comes FCA is no more there wont be ugly features that lack in that car, but for now I’d save money till the merger takes over.
So as always...it is just a big engine shoved in an overweight, cheap interior vehicle 🚗
How much does this eat up fuel, road and city driving/100km ?.  🤔
Come on FCA Pacifica Hellcat
all speed but no quality
Anyone knows the 1986 nissan cedric y30?
The tachometer and speedometer are both red,. Making it look like 2 red eyes... Get it.
Hellcat this a SRT
I get theyre performance based but at this price point this is a bit ridiculous, bmw x7 is loaded and has a button for everything you don't move anything yourself and has decent power numbers
90k just for the engine smh
Interior is trash. 90k is ridiculous
The color combination looks pretty nice to me. The interior looks a bit warmer than the more aggressive outside.
Sub 11's is outrageous enough, but even more outrageous is a TRX running 12's
You don’t realize how tall Doug is until you see him reviewing a super charged hemi in a charger, on his knees! 😂 doug is the type of guy to review your car on his knees.
Eventually the charger/challenger will have a last edition with the hellephant engine...it's obvious
haters will compalin that it interior doesnt have enough fake stitxcing to keep their panties wet.
“ThiSsSs” Doug Demuro
THE BMW M5 IT'S FASTER THAN CHARGER REDEYE 🤷🏻‍♂️
Yeah go ahead and put me in for another 4 year tour in the army I need the red eye.
Too bad it looks so bad..... can you not give me an all in one package here?
I see they found that old vat of Prowler paint under some tarps at the factory. Also good to see that Dodge hires the handicapped at its factory. Interior fitters obviously color blind. And the wide swing of the door is required for the fat ass rich dude with the phallus inadequacy issue to enter.
Doug would be a good Satan
What about that new w12 Bentley sedan? Doesn’t that do over 210?
That is not a sedan! I don't care what anybody says!
Cars for little D lololol
They gotta change the body it's been the same since 2016
Basically the ultimate Trap Lord Car
we need a charger demon
Is this a descendant from 1970's Charger ? 😁 This car looks great, sadly its not available in my country which i have to import it if i want one and if i can afford one 😄
That color looks great on that car
Got ads?  Between your infomercial and the 100 ads for your 10 min video, you are getting as bad as streetspees 717.
Me watching this video and him flooring it when I have a Passat with 170hp
Dodge be making some crazy hp cars
Dodge as successfully manufactured the          WORLDS MOST POWERFUL CLASSIC SCHOOL LUNCH SANDWICH
Will be smoked by a green EV. ICE is dead.
is my dream car DOUG but with, this 2020 my economic life went to the sink but thank  GOD am heading to Alaska seasonal job as crane op. because am from san Diego but here no one is hiring me
Mo powa babeh! (c)
There is no way I'm going 200 in a Dodge.
Hi, I upload daily entertainment videos. Don't miss the horror and adventure videos.  https://youtu.be/pU43s5it2YM
fastest production on the planet (fixed)
The interior isn't the best, but compared to begin 2000's,they're much nicer, the look is good enough to me
When we hear we either accept or reject or we translate what we hear according to our knowledge or we compare what is being said to what is already known or we oppose one idea with another. All these characteristics deny the act of listening and that act of listening puts away anything that is not true.
https://youtu.be/ZIWs5mgnUD8
“Inside peanut butter, outside jelly” 🎵
The coolant matches the paint that’s rad lmao
That’s false, the Koenigsegg Gamera is
Expensive piece of junk car
Fun fact, the doors actually open that wide because of the police cars. Dodge made the hinges able to swing open a full 90 degrees so officers can use them as cover if they are being shot at. You can get ballistic panels in the doors of the pursuit lol.
For a new car seems to actually have a lot of orange peel.
You should get a decibel reader to show off the actual sound levels!
A sedan with massive engine, just that
Inside peanut butter outside jelly. Another thing stolen from black people with no compensation
dodge dart the best
Like the video, I'm just so excited that you were in my home town of Charlotte NC. Wish I could have met you. Great video
That color is ghastly
Seems Porsche Panamera is classified as hatchback now.
An amazing car, but personally, I would prefer the TRX
4door car with 800 horse power.. Looks like we've found next dougmobile...
It’s like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich 😮 the outside is the jelly the inside is peanut butter
Purple People Eater: 797hp Hellcat Edition!! 😎🚀
I have a 2020 dodge charger sxt blacktop i really love it, yeah it’s a v6 but i believe the hellcat is too much already. I mean 70K for it nahh mine was 31K but i might trade it in later on for a scatpack, now that one is worth the money. 🔥👌🏼❤️
My M5 from 2008 can do 205 with its stock 500hp! And interior is much better.
All that made in a country where highest speed limit is 80mph!
I agree that the interior needs a refresh, but I think dodge wants to keep the price relatively affordable for people who want to buy it. If it got a newer interior it would probably start at 90-100 grand.
Isn't the new flying spur the fastest sedan
"Fastest Sedan in the World" Laughs in Brabus
MOW POWAAAAAAA
Amazing how it’s nearly as fast as Bugatti Veyron.
Why not put the awd system on these? It would be a monster on the street
yeah its strong but  no safty no handling  so what i can do?
Doug, I think it's time to talk about your diet and exercise
Doug: The Charger Redeye is the world's fastest sedan. Tesla Model S Plaid: Say sike right now.
2021 trance am is bater
God bless FCA for these ridiculous vehicles!
Just got to use the power.. You will be richly rewarded by death. There is a point of too much horsepower. With those aerodynamics, 203 mph?? It will become an airplane.
I love the fact that Fiat just keeps writing Chrysler blank checks to make these things.
I absolutely love my charger hellcat so much in fact that I am thinking of buying the redeye charger and keeping my standard charger hellcat.
*Driving on streets, does no justice for the car. Come to texas and put it on the open roads!*
we dont buy with a price tag of $90k for comfort.......... (specially a sedan with 800 horsepowers)
I’m not sure it’s the widebody. I live in Charlotte and people here ask me to do burnouts in my Elise all the time.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ... 800 bhp in a Dodge. That's going to result in serious fireworks once these hit the roads in the hands of paying customers. Said paying customers had better start booking advanced driving lessons in order to keep that back end tamed.  It's almost as if Dodge has decided that the way forward is to build the most angel dust fuelled berserker of cars.
LITERALLY EXACTLY THE SAME MATERIALS IN AN AUDI   from dash to volume controls. Adaptive cruse is an option.   Compare that to the Audi that hasn’t been refreshed yet or a 2018 Benz and the 2015 Charger has way nicer materials infotainment and seats.
Love or hate it, Dodge makes great cars despite lot of problems they face.
Definitely right about the interior
this is not the fastest sedan in the world though
Incorrect statement made Doug, this car is not the fastest sedan currently , the 2020 flying spur is . https://www.automobilemag.com/news/fastest-sedans-on-sale/
McLaren and Ferrari have 9 second cars from factory.
You'll see, they will give a Charger Demon next with 840 hp... If Dodge acts like Dodge
That Hellcat has the same steering wheel (buttons and blanks included) as my $20 grand 2018 Jeep Renegade, haha
PEANUT BUTTER AND JAM!!!!! A kids favourite sandwich which makes for Brilliant marketing!
Lets be honest. Automatic wipers are trash. They shouldn't be on any car.
Purple always looks good on a muscle car.
I would like to see a Tiger eating a Pony hidden emblem in this one
Hellcat Durango video must be coming soon, Doug has the same shirt on
it doesnt have wipers cause if u drive it in rain ur basically already in ur grave lol
Priest:  “Do you, Doug, take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?l  Doug:  “First...  Make sure to check out CARS AND BIDS...”
Buy an M5 and tune it. You will have a better, faster car for less money.
But when can we expect that Hellcat Durango review to drop? Im so excited for it
These  are the ferraris of inner city neighborhoods
DOUG YOU MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY TO CALL THIS COLOR COMBINATION PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY NOOOOOOOOO
But it's not faster than ferrari f40 😑
This is not good car and not fast
I love it and also the color.
Do we not count the Ferrari FF and the GTC4Lusso then as sedans?
GRAND CARAVAN HELLCAT DO IT
Perfect review I agree totally , I prefer ordering my cars, still to only get what I want. One thing when you say the fastest in the world. The BMW and the Mercedes are faster than 200 by much without the governor, check that out? For the those in the world who don't know
peanut butter and jelly
I gave my gf two red eyes on her birthday and it didn’t cost me more than a movie and a few drinks
Looks like shit
What brings you to Charlotte? Come review my car 😁
the way doug says "MO POWAH" reminds me of........
inside peanut butter outside jelly.
Just wait till they roll one out with 1000hp and awd lol
can u even drive it normally 😂?
Peanut butter jelly time
This must be one thirsty boy... They will never natch European cars tbh
Inside peanut butter, outside jelly
Keep em coming doug
Clearly Doug is not the kind of guy who believes in the “inside peanut butter outside jelly” school of car design
Just wait for the Charger Demon SRT Redeye widebody 550
Well.. they thought no need for much of luxury when most  gonna crash it.
Reviewers- dodge can you make the interior better. Dodge- ok, more powah Reviewer- no, k make the handling better. Dodge- ok, more powah. Reviewer- pls put better brakes Dodge- ok more powah babyyyyyyy
I know this color! It is called "aubergine" and is very common for Lada!
What a piece of garbage!
Bentley flying spur W12 = 333 km/h check on wikipedia. 320km/h the fastest sedan ? 320 went the fukin e55amg wagon on the autobahn in 2003.
isn't the bentley flying spur the fastest sedan tho?
Wish the supercharger was more common than turbochargers, I'd listen to that whine all day long
What was it’s top speed? Must have missed it...
How would a salesman at a Dodge dealer describe the Charger. In my mind it would be "Yeah, for 90k you wil get: a big engine with a supercharger, a wider body for more grip and a dated interior from 12 years ago"
GT500 has entered the chat...
Dodge missed the marketing opportunity for that interior/exterior combo:  Peanut Noir
90 k for this no I am OK with cadillac escalade
Im pretty sure a amg can go over 200
with 800 BHP, Its color is misleading, as it simply Redshifted
Doug - this car doesn't have this or that  Me - which freakin car has 797 HP at 90k ?
This will come as a shock, but the highway is still limited at 85 miles per hours. And rush hour will not open in front of you so that you could drive faster. This car is basically useless with exception of those who are going at the strip and the track ocasionnaly.
This Car just screams: Moah powa bébeh
Worlds fastest PB&J sandwich
It's : MO POWA BABYYYYY!
I don't know but colour looks nice to me.......
Fiat really did give it a nice exhaust note.
The funny thing is that the Bentley Flying Spur is the fastest Saloon. It does 207mph , around 5 more than the Hellcat
200 mph. try that on a florida street , you will end up with your car impounded and doing a bit in jail.  Get a real accelerating car tesla model 3 performance.  This charger is nothing but a burnout machine.  (  2009. Yamaha r-1. owner )
8:51 Doug said “MOOOO POOOOWAAAAA!!!” Yes BAAAAABEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!! #donutmedia 🍩🍩🍩🍩🍩🍩
Take a shot every time Doug says "more power"      Enjoy the hospital :3
This vehicle is simply a bothersome accessory required to lug the engine around. I want one. A lot.
good to see that the US still produce engines.
So charger demon 😈 when is dodge making it
Doug, either you are on a ton of Adderall  or you need to be on it. I hate the mole on your face you unfortunately look 100% like John C Reilly. Terrible to watch
“Fastest Sedan in the world”  Me looking at my Civic: It’s ok bud...you go when you want to go
Doug, this is a CAR, who cares about the gimmicks, just enjoy THE DRIVE
*Thiiis* is a 2021 penut butter and jelly hellcat redeye, and these are quirks and features, after this, I'll taste it.
I really like that Cherokee t-shirt  Edit: hold up hold up hold up. You're in charlotte? It's not downtown. It's uptown. Sorry that just bugs me. It's like saying Appalachia with a hard A in the middle, you just don't do it
The current Bentley Flying Spur (which you have *already* reviewed) has a top speed of 207 mph.
That middle parking stripe is annoying my OCD
2020 Bentley Flying Spur W12.....  207mph
It's a very cool car, true. But the E60 M5 (for all the hate it gets by people who never owned one and just heard stories) drove 328kp/h GPS even in 2005 with 507hp stock and naturally aspirated. I have a 2010 facelift V10, last model year and personally reached this speed on the German Autobahn. I live in Austria btw.  And before some comments are coming in.. Yes I know this Dodge would be faster from the line and beat me.. I know, ok
When you are an American and think horsepower is everything 😂
I really like this channel but the cars and bids shit is awfully annoying!
ah yes the prestigious peanut butter and grape jelly spec
That is so stupid I need one.
no one:  doug: daaj charger
I love the colour,black hood is a nice touch.
Doug is so happy lately. Prolly making bank off cars n bids. ;)
European Fast Sedans-"Tech , Lightness, AWD And All Rubbish. American Fast Sedans-"MOREEEEE POWERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!
Every single thing Doug questions about its nonexistence on the red-eye is available on Chargers otherwise.  Every single option he asks about is even available on the R/T.  Adaptive cruise? Yep. Auto Wipers? Yep.  I'm willing to bet the adaptive cruise doesn't exist because the sensor would take up grille/cooling space that's needed.
Tesla Model S Plaid: huehuehue
Sorry Doug, the 207-MPH 2020 Bentley Flying Spur Is the Fastest Sedan Ever Made
Exactly why James from Donut Media is Dodge powered haha Mo Powah Babeh!!
Doug just do a burn out and a doughnut. We want to see that
Charlotte, NC <3
Dodge will put that engine in everything
That car is dope boy fresh .peanutbutter inside outside jellay
Wait the colors are like pbj sandwich
Demon charger next?
200 MPH in a dodge... you go first.
guess the owner loved peanut better and jelly
Why hasn't anyone noticed he didn't actually link the charger video in the description and we didn't notice it because we already watched the video?
I'm waiting for the 200k challenger with 1700hp
Koeniggsegg makes the fastest sedan in the world...cmon Doug you should know this
All that HP plus  the build quality of a 85’ Cimarron.
This thing has headedseats right
I did not just hear this monstrosity of a dodge with 4 doors goes over 200 mph🤯
I think the style of fender flares they used looks goofy...i mean, they could have swept them out smoothly to the outer edge instead of making that semi-circle crease like *so* many other cars these days...also, how the heck does it get 200+ with such high of drag coefficient in the front!?   I guess at high speeds all that air gushing into the hood scoop really allows a lot more air to come and & mix with a lot more fuel and so at 180+ mph you still have more & more power.  Sweet.
They must have got the PB & J color package with that Redeye.
PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME!
Someone needs to strip it, convert to awd and have themselves a Dodge Hoonicorn. Gah if I was done with school I'd love to do it.
E60 m5 507hp stock unlimited did 200mph
But, Doug ....  The Interior +  The Exterior =  Peanut Butter and Jelly.
Would love to see the reliability of this in 3 years
Reminded me of when you drove streetspeed 717 hellcat! It got a little tail happy.... lol 😄
Meanwhile...The new Chevette runs on 2 D batteries,has a wind-up key.3hp while getting pushed downhill,with a tailwind slowing...and is pinkish..with polkadots.Too bad there isn't a badass car like Pontiac...Oh wait...there was..?
Great review for a super bad car !
this model just came out challenger did it first plus challenger is way better
doug be the kind of nigga that is talking shit. my s55 amg goes over 210mph and its 17 years old.....
You’re basically paying for the engine when getting this car.
What about the Koenigsegg Gemera???
Do I notice a Jeep XJ on Doug's t-shirt? :D
More power babbyyyyyy😂
Well people buy this car for the power... Not for those who want all that "granny assistant" system with luxurious bits in it.
Who keeps on checking cars and bids just to look at prices of cool cars?
Can you please review a Dodge DURANGO SRT HELLCAT
FCA is the smart for really offering some incredible vehicles without losing the brands they bought but lets hope they don't drop the ball
IT’S PEANUT BUTTA JELLY TIME!
Me in a banana suit: Peanut butter jelly car!
With 797hp you ll be glad the seats are brown...
I cant be the only one who thought about PBnJ when he was talking about the colors😂
it will be better if they but 4wheel drive in it.
Isn't the Bentley Flying Spur the fastest sedan in the world??
Man why won’t they change the rims they have used them for the 2014 model
good thing daddy doug left the traction control on this time 😂 he learned his lesson from the first hellcat he reviewed
ITS INSANELY FAST!!
$40,000 interior seems like it's pushing it. Most Civics and Corollas these days are about as good, if not better.
Anyone notice the cop at 9:56 and then he accelerated
im a full dodge/crystler fanboy they make the dumbest cars and thats what makes them so cool
That thug sound while closing door !
What’s 0-60?
Is that two coolant overflow tanks I see? I like how the coolant is also purple.  Also, I'm pretty sure car companies design, engineering and marketing departments now have a Doug Demuro criteria cars also have to pass.
Fastest BUT not quickest
This is the ugliest fastest sedan 😂
Not faster than a Taycan Turbo S, Doug.
*You guys getting cars* !?
Don't buy one used I mean like over 50,000 miles I don't expect these cars to last a hundred thousand miles
anyone notice PB&J in the colours? 🤣🤣🤣
What about the gemera
Yeah okay buddy, just wait till you see my stock 2005 Toyota Corolla.
$90k?  Can’t you get a new M5 or e63 for that money or just slightly more?  They don’t run 10.6 but 11 seconds is close enough.
He didn't mention the 0 to 60 time??
so this is the fastest sedan? with a top speed of 327km/h but the Bentley flying spur does 333km/h i’m confused
Who else looks at the scenery moving in the background to get a feel for how fast Doug is accelerating?
This is such a Tim Allen "Tool Time" sort of car.  WHAT DO WE WANT????    MORE POWER!!!!!!!!!!!!     I also find it hilarious that Dodge made a big ass sedan that you can drive 900 miles to the beach with another couple, it rides nice and is quiet on the interstate, has a big enough trunk for all their shit, big/comfy seats with a lot of room in both the front/back.  Yet you can blow the doors off most versions of the Dodge Viper.
Damn I didn’t even know they made this
I love everything about it
What’s really amazing is that it’s only 2WD, imagine if they (FCA) developed a 4WD model, as the other big boys (Audi, Benz, BMW) have. This thing could actually break into 9’s !
8:50 James Pumphrey is that you?
Who needs a car that fast on public roads ?
Lamborghini: “Lets make the door handles carbon fiber loops to increase top speed!” Dodge: Supercharged V8 go Vrooooom!
I think there will be a 1000hp hellephant charger soon......
Doug - Fastest production car on the planet Also Doug - 9 for "Performance" category on Doug Score
As somebody who has done some bracket racing on the "run what ya brung" street car nights, using the a/c system to cool the intake charge is IMO a bad idea.  They were constantly blaring over the loudspeaker to keep your a/c turned off on street car nights.  Using the a/c creates condensation, aka water, that leaks out of the bottom of your car.  That water is dumped on the track surface.  People in really fast/high horsepower cars can completely lose control hitting a spot of water on the track.  That is unless Dodge has figured out a way to use the a/c system without dumping a bunch of water out the bottom of the car.
Wireless chargers in cars are so incredibly overrated. Everyone has a phone case and usually this makes it impossible to wirelessly charge. 90k for this car isn’t a lot. No one that buys this cares about having another backup camera angle, wireless charger or automatic wipers.
That's not a 40k$ interior, that's barely a 20k$ interior. Keep in mind that for 40k$ you already get an Audi A4-A5, which has an awesome interior that is lightyears ahead of this. I get the argument about the power but for this money, I would buy something decent stock and pay someone to tune it up to 800-900-1000hp. But to be honest, no one really needs this, it's just another toy for people who want to be obnoxious and wake up the whole neighborhood in the middle of the night by just driving along the street.  Also, imagine buying this and then getting rekt on a highway by like a Tesla Model 3.
My car is soo chill it decided it did not need a fan so he spit it out
Tesla Model S P100D 1/4 mile in 10.4, 2.3 second 0-60 so pretty sure this isn't the fastest sedan in the world. Still awesome but not sure why you kept repeating that it is "the fastest".
You might as well buy a "normal" hellcat and just upgrade it to make almost 1,000hp.
5:17 inside peanut butter outside jelly, 7 days of week, 7 different...
When are they making it so the windshield wiper fluid cools the brakes?
This will make history!
Hey Dodge it’s been 6 years time to change the design of the car lol same design every year
800hp with rwd, that’s a death threat and still have a outdated interior Dodge y’all need to do better not everybody like Jeeps
Is this car legal in Canada ?
PB&J Hellcat
Whoever is approving this cars in FCA, please don't stop, don't go retirement, don't quit. Dodge is the only American company with desirable American cars.
Doug keeps calling this $80K sedan a $90K sedan.
this should have been a 4x4 car. It can't deliver the power, what's the point of the 797 horses?
I was wondering why the comments were calling it the pb&j then Doug opened the door 😂
Cars & Bids will always be new to Doug.
The supercharger whine is *chefs kiss*
I beg your pardon - but as far as I remember - Dodge and Ferrari both owned by FCA - no wonder they push these demons)
The Goober Grape car.
Fun fact   The car with which doug stands while advertising for cars and bids is the one he reviews next   I noticed that
Doug is never going to learn that width of tire has nothing to do with traction. Traction - for a given rubber composition - is mathematically proportional to pounds per square inch of contact, meaning a larger tire is less pounds per square inch, in turn meaning a larger tire only matters as far as wear, not traction.
As Jeremy Clarkson says SPEED AND POWER
Still looks like a rental... 😞
I don’t believe you ever said the 0-60 time in this video.
And yet it still has the same problems every dodge has had since the beginning of time.  It's a rwd sedan that absolutely will not be able to put that power to the ground, corners like crap, and it's strength is doing something that 99% of it's buyers will never do, go 200mph.  If you want to go sideways into the prius next to you in a rain storm, it's the perfect car.  I drove one and while it was definitely powerful, the actual use that most people will get, acceleration and twisty's the tesla I landed on is way more fun to drive.
Why is it so gross and blobby?
It not true
thats basically the exact same hood my 2007 SRT Charger has lol. All they did was added a couple vents on the sides. The main hood scoop is identical to mine.
Chrysler just keeps going downhill. First Daimler, then Fiat, and now PSA. Hard to imagine this new merger is going to be any different than the last. They're going to make the same cheap cars that they have been and eventually get destroyed by Ford and GM
Sensational car and colour combination.
Ayyyy Charlotte represent
This is ok, but I’m a working family man. When are they going to do a Caravan Hellcat?
Inside peanut butta outside jelly 😋
Mat Watson would love that interior/exterior combination
You can gripe all you want about the low rent interior, but due to CAFE regulations, Dodge won't be able to keep up with demand. There will be a waitlist for these things. Dodge is making Hellcat versions of the Charger, Challenger, Ram Pick-up, and Jeep Cherokees because they sell like hotcakes. I think the interior looks fine.
Come on Doug, go ahead and say it “MO POWAH BABY!!!”
Rain sensing wipers and radar adaptive cruise are optional on Chargers
I'm surprised it doesn't have roll up windows.
No one:  Doug: check out cars and bids if you want to sell your soul and get the most amount of money and views.
If I could review the Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat Redeye with Doug DeMuros I would pack up the Hash Pipe with Rocky and get all schmoked up.
Most car manufacturers: We’re going to innovate and give the customers more tech and features for their dollar, and make them sporty and fun to drive.  MOPAR: SEDAN WIT TRUCK ENGINE AND BLOWER GO BRRRRRRRR.
Moooooooorrreeee powaaaaaaa
You can tell that Doug is petrified of this car and doesn’t mash the gas to check out how fast it really is, because he almost crashed streetspeed717’s hellcat a few years ago.
Doug, buddy, repeat after me rq: AH MO POWA BABEH!!
"People who buy these cars don't care"   WRONG!!!!!
except its not faster than a tesla plaid. better luck next red light
Love it, Go Dodge!
Anyone know where I can buy a car online?
I would not want to be driving anywhere close to 200mph in a car assembled by Chrysler.
wouldn’t the fastest sedan be the tesla model S? even without the plaid version?
8:50 and 9:02 someone hit up that boy James Pumphrey and tell him to put this in an episode 😂
Quirk: Over 800HP Feature: Over 800HP
Can’t wait for the hellcat Pacifica
So stupid. What is the point?
Fuel consumption: yes. Highway pulls must be insane with this thing. It would be even better when the eventually move to a new chassis.
“Literally every other car has automatic windshield wipers “  ...? Ugh that’s is definitely not true Doug ...  I can’t think of even One car that has that feature . It’s pretty rare
Cars and bids 🤷
Is a Dodge Charger SRT Demon coming next?
color combo is stunning
I really love this machine. The only problem is that they are purchased by young rich kids that don’t believe in the law. It appears that expensive tickets aren’t a deterrent.
Yes I have the same color hellraisin baby♡
Its technically not the fastest sedan, that honor goes to the Alpina B7. The B7 has a top speed of 207, while the hellcat redeye has a top speed of 203.
I'll have to think loooong and deep before I get this over a BMW M550i.
The budget pie allows for X amount of money to go to interior accoutrements and Y goes to the power, and handling performance.
You embodied the needs of a real mopar owner! Interior is for the fancy pants cars. We're too busy blowing the doors off them and definitely serving GAP SAUCE to every shit-stang owner💪🏾 #MOPARORNOCAR
Lies once the Tesla model s plaid is out it will be like racing a Corolla
Just get an sxt and do an engine swap would be half the price
I don't think it's the fastest, the M5 beats it with less power, imagine it being tuned to 800 like this one, you'd have a much faster car in a much better ride quality
0:19 uhhhhh i dont think so chief... alpina b7 is “the fastest sedan” ever
E60 m5 goes 214mph not the fastest though
why are FCA vehicles dominating your score board?
Doug is the type of guy to give every car a Doug Score in the mid 60s.😂
0:44 Is the audi allroad really a cool? Are you sure doug?? I can't believe you anymore...
Bring back real estate Doug reviews with the quirks and features lol
W12 Flying sphur???
Daddy Doug, your Dougscore scale is getting less and less accurate in distinguishing between cars and you really need to revise it. You don't have any cars in the top 20% and I don't think you have many cars left to populate this range.  If you keep it this way, your scoreing scale will become almost blind and I am telling you this as an expert in evaluation systems.
It's sad that I'll most likely never be able to afford this.
If you're in charlotte you better have gone to vinwiki. Its so closeeee
Review alpina b7
The next version will obviously be called the Hellcat Browneye... *because when you drive it you drop a mooky stank in your bridges.*
It's top speed is slower than the Bentley flying spur.
Doug: Fastest sedan? Me: calling a tuk tuk with a trunk
There was some stupid rap song i think it was called Inside peanut butter outside Jelly.... not a good song.
Doug reminds me of Val Kilmer’s character in Real Genius.
I'm 100% confident Doug knows about his "THIIIIIISSSS"
very beautiful color
need a button to skip that "cars and bids" ad. getting seriously repetitive
Yea, no way in hell would I trust a Chrysler to go 200mph without the wheels falling off.
What about the flying spur it goes 207 right?
I love this thing but I agree you hop in one in 2015 you have already been in a 2021 LOL.
I want a car which will try to kill me every time I press the pedal to the metal.  Dodge: We have something for you.
Mo powa baby
3:36 Doug preparing to give the car pleasure.
EVERYONE IS WRONG THE BENTLEY FLYING SPUR W12 IS THE FASTEST SEDAN.  ⬇️Continue Reading⬇️        The Bentley Flying Spur W12 Is The Fastest Sedan. 207 MPH Top Speed. 0-60 in 3.7 seconds. Everybody is getting it wrong. This would be the second fastest 4 door after the Flying Spur W12. The Bentley Flying Spur V8 would the third fastest sedan at 198 MPH. 0-60 of 4.0 seconds. I think everyone forgets the speed of the Flying Spur. Because it’s the not the most popular Bentley, therefore it’s not the most popular car. So, not as much people know the Flying Spur as much as the Charger Redeye. So it would be easy to forget the Bentley Flying Spur with the W12 as the fastest sedan.
Doug is the kind of guy who parks at the very end of the parking lot so he can open the door completely so that he can barley reach it if he wants to close it.
American need to make a better interior :(
They should add AWD that can be turned off when needed.
Just figured out Doug knows shit about the cars he review. Only quirks and subjective info.
The Flying Spur claims it’s the fastest sedan in the world at 207 mph but it is a tad pricier.
I love the “O” face he makes when he hits the throttle
It's the fastest sedan in the world... but it looks almost exactly like my neighbors 2014 regular old charger... How staggeringly disappointing is that?
I want to see it reach 200 I dont believe it. Its too heavy
if im spending over 100k on a car, it would make sense to get the color and interior i want since its so expensive. more money more personal touch
Serious question. Can you feel the difference between 707 & 797 HP?
Thats one fast PB&J Sandwich
There’s obviously cruise control
would love to see how good this car would be if it was awd
At least the car community can stay strong in 2020.
Doug must have rolled his eyes 800 times here in the comments just baffled at all the triggered Tesla types confusing "fastest" with "quickest". 🙄
That was a great review. Spot On.
I gotta say... the best part of Fiat owning Chrysler is they only care about Jeep. So over at Dodge mom and dad haven't been home for years and Dodge has been throwing a rager.
I said it in the wide body review and I’ll say it here. The doors open that wide because of Chargers being used by police. Doors sometimes have to be used as shields, and it’s easier for them to make one hinge and put it in all Chargers.
Doug is getting STINGEY with the acceleration score!
Tesla is typing...
"fastest sedan in the world" me: (thinking about my superchaged 800hp g8) hm.....
Almost $90k and it STILL comes with blank switches, a trashy pedal style parking brake and HALOGENS. That’s the most American thing a car can do
When is this coming to the U.S?
Aww, Doug missed an, "Inside peanut butter, outside jelly" joke
idk why people care about that its a muscle car you pay for the ENGINE BRUH its crazyyyyy
Doug, the kinda guy who doesn’t think peanut butter and jelly when he sees light brown and purple together.....
My dad has a Hellrasin Challenger, pictures and the video really don't do the color justice, it is AWESOME.
Doug's wife notices stains in Doug's underwear. "Honey, have you been driving a Dodge again!?"
My 2009 E60 M5 stock out of the box does 206mph... Natural aspirated to boot, with only 500 horse... Shifts in the 7th gear 177 ...  THE BOYS IN GERMANY HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR YEARS-
Doug you’re hitting about Norwood 3. Time to hit the micro-needing pen and rogaine.
Does anyone want to mention that Teslas are sedans, and will shit on this thing in the 1/4?
It’s a boat not a sedan
really loving the smooth segue directly from the interior to the driving experience
Peanut Butter Jelly Time!!!
The Bentley flying spur will do over 200mph as well but with a well made and beautiful interior.
9 for acceleration? Fastest = 10, no other value.
It’s peanut butter jelly themed and I love it
But no love for the 300..
No thanks, Ill take a mirage or spark or prius. too much power there lol
"They just want more power". But how numerous are these buyers. Is is selling like hot cakes, or is it more like the AMG wagons and a toy to give to reviewers and push out buyers for more reasonable pricepoint, basically a halo car. I'm really interested in this, not judging
I really want to use the performance
I believe the Bentley Flying Spur is the fastest sedan on planet since it reaches 207 mph versus 203 from the redeye.
1000hp awd turbo k seria civic: you think i am a joke ?
Its a $35.000 dollar car with a $45.000 powertrain
Those Generic Fender Flares are becoming out dated real Fast .
I want one as a daily.  Just cause...
This SRT REDEYE is absolutely gorgeous. I love the color, the wheels. I’m in love with this car DOUG.
Honestly most of the dodge 392 trims are fun to drive, (talking from experience of a scat pack)
Peanut butter and jelly
Doug at this point, Cars and bids isn’t new.
It's fast, so you can get to your dealer for repairs quicker! lol
They designed those doors to open that wide for police use.
But will it last over 100,900 miles tho😂😂😂
What color combo would you like?  Peanut butter and jelly...grape....
Xr8 Ford falcon been limited to 230kph since 2004 haha
When Doug said “More Power” I was hoping he would cut to Donut’s “Mo Powa Baby”
800hp yes , Fastest sedan in the World Ahhh....NO. Lmao
Is there a drawing of a cat in the glove box scratching the eyes out of a mustang?
Those ugly accords think their faster than Chargers 🤦🤭😂😂😂😂
“- But you’d be wrong”   Thank you Jeremy Clarkson
I’m sure Doug was a little hesitant to do this video because of the last time
This is my dream car
American horsepower but Fiat ergonomics.
Doug....you know better.  Really?  Bringing up the lack of adaptive cruise control?  The SRT 392 and lower models have it.  Why doesn't any of the hellcat versions have it?  The center-mounted sensor takes up too much space which is needed for airflow.
wonder how fast it will go around the nurburgring
Bentley Flying Spur top speed is 207mph. It has a nicer glove box latch too.
90k makes sense. As a mechanic and someone who builds motors that shit adds up quick and to have a trans and whole driveline that can handle it takes a lot of money. Especially the suspension is important to handle power, there’s a lot to it people don’t see/understand
doesn’t the flying spur go faster?
So you are saying if I wanted to run from a Police helicopter with 4 friends... this is definitely the car?
EVERY other car at this price point has.....  800 horses?  Well..... no
So cool!
I gotta have that car
Do the BMW Alpina B7!!! Both the charger and B7 compete for fastest sedan
Can this thing hold up to 100k miles😏
It’s the only  American sedan, that doesn’t deserve to die
Can dodge please bring back the magnum with this engine ??
I wonder how that car would perform at the Nurburgring or something like that. Would probably get outclassed by a 993 turbo.
Still waiting for the hellcat pinkeye
Where is the 3rd pedal?!
Gas milage go brrr
We’re always quick to claimed the title “the world’s fastest sedan” but that’s with the competition electronically limited to a certain speed and power 🤦🏾‍♂️
I want a scat pack over a hellcat
Anyone else thougth of cowboy bebop when red eye got mentioned?
What’s next? The Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat Redeye Blacktooth?
I'll Take RS6 Anytime...Doug
Hardly will get sell well here in Switzerland.
$150,000 USD here in Au for the regular 707hp SRT Hellcat.  Don't know if we'll get this version but it will not be cheap :(
“The power chiller” is a nickname I would love to have
a toyota yaris has auto wipers...
So your telling me I can put a 2021 Dodge Charger hood on my 2020 Dodge Charger and gain more power?!? That's illegal!
Next year: The 2022 Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat Demuro with 1100 horsepower is the fastest sedan in the world!
When he said “MORE POWER!!!” I think I know what we all expected to follow.
Hellcats, & Redeyes are two different engines. A Redeye is a de-tuned Demon engine..
Who cares about how fast it is when its going to spend its time at the garage because fiat
This a dream
My old challenger had an AM radio and roll down windows. But it was loud and fast, perfect.
Not really a looker
It would be worth buying just to hear those cold early morning starts....neighbours would love it!
LaFerrari Aperta
Dodge wins cars.
I daily a ZL11LE and would love this for my wife
That’s for sure a long ass name.
It’s a muscle car, it’s not supposed to be made out of the best materials. Dodge is the only company that has stuck to the original muscle car recipe
Cars and bids is awesome, i'm no lawyer but promising most money and views  seems risky....so many litigious people out there. Just food for thought. Keep up the great videos!
Question: At what speed do parts start falling off and failing? Answer: Any speed! It’s a Chrysler!
Why is this on your second channel?
"The people who drive this car at 90k are....." idiots
It’s a muscle car , who cares about the interior except you loo
You hit the nail on the head. Screw cruise control. LAUNCH CONTROL!!!!
When you have a sedan this cool . The last thing you worrie about , is how wide the doors open .😂
you should do the 2021 kia telluride next
Worth every penny. I wish they would offer it in Manual. That much power, I want to control it with a clutch.
All that power and speed and it is the ugliest car I have ever seen, except for the Yugo.
Horrible colour,I'm from Leeds GB our taxi s have a black bonnet
You mean km/h.
Doug Charger
I remember how RCR described 90s Dodge Viper This here gives me similar vibes. Just a batshit crazy car
Nice color, I really hope no fool gets this then r.i.p to him or her & others on the road. Doge the only one outta the big 3 muscle car brand doing it right.  Ford had 4 big v8 cars but stop making it them in 2012  they could've had them go toe to with this but
The doors open that much becuase ,when your in a fire suit at the track, you generally need more space to get out since your a bit stiff in the suit
That's such a marmite spec but I love it😍😍
The doors open so wide because that was a complaint on the early Chargers in the law enforcement community. Big ole boys with a gun belt needed a little more room.
The redeye has 800hp does the ghibli
8:20    Legendary transition
similar to alfa's interior I see, yet again both are from the same group
I like the XJ T-Shirt.
It’s a brave new world when a sedan can go faster than a Lamborghini huracan or an f40
I wonder if Doug is going to either edit/make a statement about repeatedly saying this car is the fastest sedan in the world. Just as a reminder Flying spur (207) Alpina b5+ b7 (205) Brabus s900 rocket (210+)
My used 2011 Sonata that I paid $5000 for has more standard features than this $90k car. Only missing the 'more power' thing and less trips to the gas station. Lol
0-60 would be under 2 seconds if it could maintain traction 🤣
This and Ram Trx... FCA was like *GO STUPID GO CRAZY*
9:54 there is literally a cop right there and Doug hits the throttle
Thissssss!
9:57 easy Doug, we don’t need you to give us flashbacks of almost crashing StreetSpeed’s hellcat
I swear this is what every 392 owner thinks they're driving 🙄
Meh. I’d rather have the new Cadillac Escalade.
Actually in this car you close the door with a device that shares its position with the accelerator pedal. Its to save weight
The usb slot is inside of the center compartment. I know because I actually own a charger.
I love the colors! So cool.
8:50 James pumphrey took over Dougs soul for a few seconds
Peanut Butter and Jelley
ultimate car, it gives me a big smile
M5 stage 3 would embarrasse it.
Question for Doug. Do you buy this or a loaded M550i, they're the same price and about the same 0-60?
Might as well shut down all Cars N Coffees where ever this is sold. Vulgar.
Douglas
Doug where did u get that XJ shirt????
This car needs a makeover  Dodge: yeah, your right. Make it faster then!
Auto Manufacturers: you can't just put a 700-800hp V8 in everything! 😠 FCA: Haha supercharger go WHEEEE 🤪
Chargers and Challengers desperately need a refresh/new generation
How is the reliability on these engines?
Tesla?
Where are the yellow shipping protectors????
I think the doors open so wide because older people will buy it too so it will be easier access for them
Doug, be a man. Grab the door handle as you enter the vehicle and pull it closed. It only takes a small amount of coordination. You can do it!
I'm still waiting for Doug to get pulled over in one of these videos.
OMG our Pastor from church just purchased the Hellcat Red-eye Demon Hellraisin for himself. That ain't righteous.
Still has a $20,000 interior... SMH, definitely not worth it, MORE power is the last thing it needed.. Great review!!! 👏🏾👌🏾👏🏾✊🏾
Doug: THIS type of guy
8:51 I was just waiting for James to come out and scream MO POWA BABY 🤣
Mo power babyyyyyyyyy
Love that color!!
Purple People Eater
The title is not true.
They need to put one of those engines in an AWD Maserati Quattroporte
People aren't buying these, they're getting loans from the bank and paying 500+ a month lol or leasing
2:40 in this shot the reflections on the body paint look like some extensive bird poop :D
797 at the flywheel
And Doug you sure a demon isn’t the best car out there lol
GOD DA***T DOUG WE ALL LIVE FOR YOUR HIGHWAY PULL REACTION!!!!!  So disappointed 😢
Dodge man that’s the comment dodge man
That’s actually the color combo I’d pick haha. Maybe with bronze wheels
Well, i think that the most of the Porsches from hell (stock off course) will wipe up the floor with this thing.....on the track and especially on the road. This is still just a car for a driving in a straight line, nothing else.....90000 USD for that thing? Is it some joke? Any Honda Civic fom the 90's with a bit of tuning is gonna blow off this thing without any doubt.
He forgot to say it's very fast when you drive straight! Don't try to turn this piece of junk when you are driving fast...
That’s America babyyyyyyyy
OH LAWD HE COMIN'             That is one thicc sedan!
The most shocking fact is it’s made from the same company which produce peugeot 208 amd fiat 500
Dodge missed the marketing opportunity for that interior/exterior combo:  Peanut Noir
Sorry Doug,but the fastest sedan in the world is the Mercedes Brabus Rocked 900 with 217.mph
Tbh Charger hellcat been the fastest sedan. They been going 203mph since their debut
Dodge Charger = SuperCar wannabe
Ah yes the peanut butter and grape jelly colour combination, absolutely beautiful.
Fastest maybe, but not quickest
20 years ago the BMW M5 would go well over 180 mph. Yawn.
I will sit back and wait for the 1000 HP Charger
Thats more like a $10k car interior with an aftermarket dash and infotainment😂😂🤣.  But Hellcat and muscle car enthusiasts don't care bout nunadat‼️😂😂
Already BMW E60 M5 with it's V10 engine was capable of 334kmh. It was 16 years a go and this is even slower. Surely not even in top 10 of series production sedans, propably not even in top 20.
Skyline is forbidden,but not this car color..How's that possible?
What an ugly car. They killed original car spirit.
FCA is good at putting big engines in an aging line-up and then call them a new cars.  Have fun with FCA reliability and going 200mph in the city!
Look, Dodge, these names are getting out of hand. This car now has FOUR names in it.
Still rather have an M8 GC over this... European manufacturing and details aren't of this planet!
You’re in Charlotte with Michigan plates...interesting 🤔
best car sound i ever heard
Goooo mopar
I’s just me or it is a pimp car? And BTW faster than a Ferrari??? Can it make a turn at high speed like a Ferrari?
I'm gonna pay my buddy Tyrone to get his brothas to cop one for me. The brothas know mopars. This should be an easy buy.
Laughs and texts Benny.
Bentley Flying Spur at 207 miles per hour should be a faster sedan.
wasup with the demon ?
Bet that door opening so far is some cop thing.  Get in with belt n gear or something idk.
Them: sedans don’t sell anymore Dodge: no, p*ssy sedans don’t sell anymore
But can it turn?
1.cruise control is for pussy’s and let’s be honest who is doing the speed limit in a red eye. 2. It’s a muscle car fuck a good back up camera and all that other technology all I care About is the performance.
Lol.. cannot wait for the Cadillac guys to get their panties all twisted up over this.. too bad the Cadillac blackdud v just realesed does not touch these performance numbers..
All the manufacturers are going electric and smaller engines... meanwhile Dodge does this...
The Hellcat Wide Body looked 100x better than this.
I don't care about cheap plastics in the interior in a 800hp sedan😂😍
that ugly front mudflaps :(
If only there were more cars like this today, where your money goes towards power and performance and not useless infotainment gimmicks, most of which you aint ever gonna use anyway. Like who cares if my car doesnt have a buttload of cameras, or if the infotainment cant run warzone for me to play waiting in traffic.
Imagine cops using that
800-hp PB&J
Grape jelly & peanut butter color combo :)
As crazy as that is considering it's "just" a Dodge Charger, it's still not the fastest sedan in the world.
Peanut butter and jelly colour combo, makes sense
WOW!!!Dodge have all that muscle!
Doug is the kind of guy who gets the party started with a case of Zima
I like when Doug's accelerating he's always looking around for police cars
Koenisegg gamera: hold my horse power
does new cars have automatic wipers?! And I get mad about the turn signals going off automatically when I straighten up, and no I am not 100 years but 16 yes 16 and I don't like new tech that much
This Dodge is not the fastest sedan in the world...... You might wanna check "The Brabus Rocket 900".....which have 900 horses..... The Official Brabus Website : 0 to 60  - 3.7 sec 0 to 120 - 9.1 sec  220 mph top speed   ....and don't compare this piece of junk with Ferrari F40....build more than 30 years ago......and which is one of the best sports car ever made...  So........ Goodbye Dodge
Zhis is 🤣🤣🤣
I really like the color combo on this one haha
It seems like Doug is on a Dodge kick lately.
Love the “but you would be wrong cut.” Fully agree. I personally prefer more refined vehicles, but I am so glad this exists.
Great Video like always! But the fastest sedan is the Bentley Flying Spur with 333 kph, 6 more than the Red Eye.The fastest accelerating sedan is the Porsche Taycan (2,8 s 0-100 kph) or the Porsche Panamera Turbo S (3,1 s) if you stick with combustion engines.
Audi RS7 and M5 owners are really upset with this title. Hell I'm upset with this title. AWD M5 0-60 2.9 sec.
Even at 30K this interior suck! Dodge interior are the worst in the industry!
Not sure if the T shirt is a LaForza or a first gen Forester.
The maniacs at DODGE did it again!!
Still waiting on the Pacifica Hellcat or Demon
Everyone: saddle brown interior Doug: peanut butter!
Fastest pickup, fastest sedan, what next? The engineers have been let loose over at Dodge. Love it. That said, all 3 American manufacturers are making amazing stuff these days, and I love that also.
“it has 800 horsepower and can’t turn for shit”
Strange the previous model year hellcat offered adaptive cruise control and rain sensing wipers in the tech group.
Can the final drive (differential gearing) be changed to like ~2.73:1 or ~4.11:1?
Damn, beautiful car! Hard to believe its a Dodge.
they just keep adding more names!!
7:23 Chrysler🤔
Remember this. Your paying the 87k + for the performance, the rest it’s just additional. They sort of took a page out of Toyota. For Toyota you pay for the reliability, engine & transmission.
5:20 - Anyone else have the "It's peanut butter jelly time! It's peanut butter jelly time!" come to mind...
Doug is the type of guy that sticks himself with an epi-pen before getting into a car with a peanut butter colored interior.
What about the Dodge Demon. That’s the faster at car and you can buy it at almost any dodge dealer
Who else added “babeh” to “more power” when he said that 8:51😂
Love how Doug make it clear for us what to ask for at your local dodge dealership. Morrree powweeerrr
It’s not the fastest sedan in the world. Brabus Rocket 900 is
please give this awd
"This is an amazing track car. I can't believe it's not a luxury sedan full of useless crap." Really? Waiting for them to make the luxury sedan version so you can be all "It costs so much more but the performance is worse."
This car screams America
Actually the brabus 800 did 231 mph so I’d say this dodge is pretty slow compared. The top 7 places of the fastest saloon cars are all brabuses if you want a fast saloon go to brabus
Your bang on about the customers.  Its my dream car for the power although I will admit that the interior needs to be remodeled
Biggest bullshit ever, with 40k u can make double the power, but you have to build it, and nobody will just hand it to u
Besides the obvious hp increase and a few cosmetic touches ... this is no different than any other WB hellcat
Inside peanut butter, outside jelly 🍇🥜 how did he not catch that?🤦🏽‍♂️😅
Isn't the fastest sedan the Gemera?
"If you open the door too far then the door is too far opened." It's like those commercials "are you the type of utter moron who routinely pokes their eye out with cooked linguine while accidentally shaving the cat?! Then you'll love Doug Demuro's car reviews!"
What brand of peanut butter do you buy?
"It's impossible to explain..." Impossible impossible? Or just impossible for you?
no hate but the m5 competition would slaughter that in a quarter mile
That's not what "ultimate" means.
'fastest sedan in the world' 'runs a 10.6 second quarter mile' *looks up tesla model s quarter mile* 10.51 seconds hmmmm
those rims fit the car perfectly
Am I the only one who absolutely hates adaptive cruise?
800 hp !! That’s insane .
some kid at my school said his kia forte was the fastest car in town. Btw, my town is full of millionaires so...
This could be the most American car.
at least my vr6 jetta sounds cool
Man I want one so bad looks like I gotta start doing overtime lol
Nice RSX  @10:19
Model s: “am I a joke to you”
I don't think having this trash will keep me from running into a tree or cutting other's off and running red lights while I pretend I'm batman. Having this trash isn't worth it. Didn't Dodge sell out to a french car company Peugeot or something like that? They are on the brink of bankruptcy.
dodge makes the best cars in the world 💜 in my opinion!
Lol at four door sports cars, don't get me wrong, it's nice, if you have to lug around the fat GF and the kids. Lol!
Okay it's the most powerful sedan it does 203 mph where as the bentley flying spur and alphina b7  does 207 mph
I’ll take my g8 over the charger
It just seems vulgar almost, ya know?
That thing is not worth anywhere near that price. The interior is absolute garbage and lack of basic features for cars at that price. Full of cheap plastics.
@9:58 Doug had a flashback
remember that time doug almost wrecked the first hellcat he drove. that  was nuts.
Are we just supposed to ignore the fact that the "carsandbids" plug had doug talking infront of the new Dodge Durango Hellcat?
Wait...this company doesn't even have a badge, what would your friends think🤔🙄 (wait, 2 red slashes, does that count)
8:48 I was expecting Doug to say “Mo pawa baybeh” from Donut Media’s James 😂😅. That’d been cool
I had a B5 Blue R/T, and it got a lot of compliments from kids and adults. The perfect version of this car is the Scat Pack widebody. I don't know if I would want a Hellcat.
It’s also a dodge sooooo
when is dodge magnum
9:27 im cu-
I love the look of this car, just so much better looking than the challenger.
“200 miles an hour” more like 200 miles right before the transmission goes out 😂
Person lending Doug the car : This car has 800 horsepower and goes 0 to 60 in the blink of an eye, Doug ; oh boy I can't wait to get this on the road ! Person lending Doug the car : by the way I don't want you to drive it on the highway But feel free to drive it around the neighborhood where the posted speed limit is 30 miles an hour . Doug : that's a quirk I wasn't expecting !
Charger Redeye: 203 mph  BMW Alpina B7: 205 mph  Bentley Flying Spur: 207 mph  Might want to rethink your "fastest sedan in the world" claim.
Nice car but 2020 G Power m5 is still faster, its able to do about 220 mph
You paying for performance not luxury
other manufacturers in 2030: electric cars, advanced hybrids  chrysler in 2030: fuck it grand caravan hellcat
You know what suck about this? *GRIP*
“The fastest sedan in the world” um well you kinda forgot about barbus having three sedans in their line up that go faster than this. And before you comment that barbus is not a car brand well it actually is. It got the constructor certification from Germany making it its own distinct brand not just a tuner.
Oh hey look at that, Doug is in Charlotte
If you're buying aa 800hp car and still need driver aids, you can't handle the car.
This one is too good to not be on the main channel  ❤️❤️
“Inside peanut butter outside jelly”
200 mph is an impressive figure for sure, but i dont think that this comes from the 800 hp. an e63 amg for example has 585 hp but is locked to 180 mph, if this electronic lock wasnt there it would easliy go 200 as well
An Alpina B7 does 205mph and it is also finer than even a regular 7 series. But in the end, this is not a bad deal, as the Alpina cost 4x this car. However what this car does with the extra 200hp to achieve the same top speed is still a mystery.
The thing is, for 80 grand I would rather buy a 2013 M5 and tune it.
I like how the calipers subtly match the interior
Mo powa baby !!
Don't get it confused people the 2015-2018 SRT 392 is what he was referring to from 2019 on they only offer optioned out scat packs the 15-18 were hellcats interiors and suspension with the motor
I would never judge how someone who makes more money than me chooses to spend it. To each his own. However, even though you're pretty much paying for the engine and speed, wouldn't be cheaper, more satisfying, and more impressive to just modify a MUCH cheaper car to do the same thing? There's an F-body or 350z out there that would smoke this thing for a quarter of the cost in mods. It just seems like a gimmick at this point.
That color combination just makes me want a peanut butter and jelly sandwich 🥪
I hope a new gen will be developed under Stellantis
Omg that Durango Hellcat is coming 👀
I honestly think the color combo is pretty cool
I wish dodge made a awd hellcat charger
This is not the fastest sedan. The original narrow body charger hellcat could also hit 203. The Alpina B7 can hit 205. And ungoverned, M5s and S65s have been going faster than that since the mid 00s
The names get longer and longer every year
Hellraisin! Great joke, Dodge! 🍄
Okay so the only reason I'm gonna mention its because its on the title. This is wrong. The Alpina B7 is the fastest sedan in the world albeit by 2 mph but still. This is wrong lol
Thanks, Doug! Supporting a fellow republican.
I wish they'd bring back the magnum and throw the hellcat engine in it. More fast wagons
Doug the type of guy to .... Not mention the colour coded engine coolant reservoir under the hood 😀
Doug, your jokes are becoming unbearable. Stop it.
8:06 sorry the red eye doesn’t have all those quirks Douge it’s just it’s a mans car
So, Dodge makes a V6 AWD but not the 800hp?
ugly af
Fastest sedan in the world... Laugh in brabus
Doug doesn't get the fact that the engine is a massive part of the 90k price EDIT: a bit too soon 😀

This car costs a 100 bucks per horsepower
Mo powa baby
The colour scheme is absolutely offensive. Should be banned. Poor car.
this
Doug traveled to North Carolina for us !
They need to put this engine in an all new redesign body...
The price per horsepower is actually really good!
GT 63s?
These vehicles are ridiculous.
This is the only dodge I would buy
8:50 MO POWA BABEH!!
In 1901, the first man to ever put peanut butter and jelly together just rolled in his grave. 5:18
All jokes aside, does anybody know when the charger will get a facelift or fully redesigned?
From the same company that brings you the 69hp Fiat Panda. They seem to use the same interior 😉  FCA must be the car company that offers the widest range of powers for their passenger cars.
I’m so proud of Dodge! An American manufacturer not afraid of speed records!
8:50 I thought for sure he would’ve said “MO POWA BABEH!!!”
Hell raisen. That’s a double entendre I’m a big rap enthusiast too and that’s pretty cool that u mention that my two favorite things rap and cars
Doug should launch a merch in my opinion
this car is on Drugs lol
Excactly More power! Dodge ain’t playing they know they gotta killer car and they sell
Kind of a shame they don't improve the looks of these. For the top end chargers it should stand out a bit more imo.
7:22 that gap tho
Only car company with so many exciting exterior and interior color combinations wish more could do that
Might be the fastest sedan but I'd trade quality over raw speed.  At the end of the day it's still a dodge.  And their interiors are gross.
You are insane to score the "value" at just 5 points. You said it yourself. $300K in performence in a $90K car. The people who are byuing these are the people who spend the money on power. This car is a bargain!
In God We Trust, but we drive a Hellcat Redeye... and Demon.
love the cherokee shirt dougie, keepin it REAL !!!
The fasted sedan is a Tesla model s I don’t think that this is the fastest just saying
But what's the 0-60 time???
Door opens far for cops
Lmao the interior still looks exactly the same as my 2011 R/T
My 2015 Charger SRT 392 has adaptive cruise control... it’s something to do with it being a hellcat, because no hellcats have ACC. Probably cooler lines or something behind the bumper in the way....
12 year old Supra fan boys: that’s cute
Charger in Hellraisin, yes please! 💜
I don't get why it's not 4WD like M5 and E63S yet they all share the same manufacturing facility MAGNA... Pretty sure they can figure something out. If the oil pan is too low make it a dry-sump system. Come on MOPAR!!
I really want one in brown: my Browneye.
This car tastes like grape jolly ranchers
eargasm heaven
My '13 RT Charger has a few of the features missing here. I'm sure this charger isn't fully loaded.. Still at this point those should be standard
I've been liking these more and more lately.. pretty good bang for your buck too

Did they really call it a "redeye"?
Doug is the Quentin Tarantino of automotive reviews...
The fact that this car does not have good materials/equipment is pretty bad because you pay 90k just for the power and you still get gapped by a nagasaki boosted boi 😭😭😂😂
Imagine the 2025 charger redeye 🤔 supercharged v6 with electric assistance ⚡️ ... 1200hp stock 😂
Imagine the 2025 charger redeye 🤔 supercharged v6 with electric assistance ⚡️ ... 1200hp stock 😂
uhg i want it
Heh, I'd daily drive it. Wife wouldn't like the gas mileage but I'd daily drive it lol.
The hellcat logo in the gauge cluster screen looks like it's from the third album of an irrelevant Midwestern nu metal band from 1997
Meanwhile Porsche GT3 s getting +10 hp upgrades .
This thing's going to be falling apart in 2 years especially with all that torque
He isn’t aware that a Tesla Model S will do the quarter in 10.5 sec is he...
I have found my favorite spec!!! PB&J
I have a new RAV4 and the adaptive cruise control is annoying af.
The dodge demon is faster with 9s in quarter miles but top speed is 198 mph
Damn Doug really do be driving by my ex’s house 😨
I find it incredible that the Americans can get a shoebox to 200mph 😁
8:49 MO POWAH BABEH!!!!
License plate needs to be “ HLO KTY “
Thissssssssss 🤔 this guy drag it 😁
Don't tune and get after market parts to build your drift car engine, just fucking get one of this engine and you get 800 hp stock.
Ha Haaaaaa! 😂
Love this car but hate how most of the owners seem to drive them so recklessly
OMG this guy really didn't even halfway floor it didn't hear that supercharger at all just you talking too much and repeating yourself Yo job for now on is to step on the gas you did this with the Genesis truck and now you doing it with the Hellcat Redeye get it together I'll give you one more video before I unsubscribe I know you wouldn't care cuz that's my subscribers but damn bro step on the gas I wish I could had the chance
But he drove it like a bitch
Dude gets to review a 10 second factory car for 86k with 800hp and bitching about interior nonsense.
Surprised you didn't find out the price of a set of tires just so you could mention it as a consumable expense needed every 5000 miles.
I don't want to imagine how scary it must be getting to top speed with this thing
A lot of cars are faster than the f40
Chrysler: what do you guys want?  Mopar guys: MO POWEH BABEH
Designed basically for bragging rights and strip it and put it to drag race! Like the engine, hate everything else! At least the Challenger looks good!
Remember the time you almost killed yourself driving the original hell cat? 🤣🤣☠
This has to be the cheapest car to repair because everything is cheaply available.
THis...
Adaptive cruise control comes on a 392 if you want it the hellcats move too fast and it would make it a safety concern to have the braking function on
The Jaguar XE Project 8 can 322 kmh
Still go for the M5 competition, it's a better car
This car is literally a peanut butter jam sandwich
Audi RS6 all day and night
I don’t think it the fastest in the world 🤷🏾‍♂️
I’m sorry, that was the smoothest transition between reviewing and driving I’ve ever seen!!
Using the numbers on your keyboard from 0 to 9, Doug says: "THIS for now fastest sedan quirks and features RAISIN (engine idle noise) red eye slur improves this car THAT performance." Accurate review.
It's FCA Week
I wonder what’s gonna be the max hp for these cars in the future, at this rate well be at 1500 by the end of 2028 lmao
Would only get one if they made the handling better. Last one I drove handled like a boat. The extra 10,000 could go towards awd
8:49 *MOO POWA BABEH*
the charger wide-body rims are same as the dodge challenger hellcat rims and now this charger has the other challenger... and maybe MAYBE after this model there will be a charger demon, I talk too much sorry
Says the interior isn't as nice as it should be. Buys a Land Rover Defender for 50k USD.
P&J colour!!! Looks great!
That color combo is effectively “Goober Grape”
For a second I thought Doug was gonna say "Mo powa baby"
MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE PAWER BABY!!!!
"World's fastest sedan" WRONG !  Tesla Model S Performance now does the quarter-mile in 10.45sec, Porsche Taycan Turbo S in 10.47,  Dodge Charger Redeye in 10.6... Model S Performance does 0-60 in 2.3sec, Taycan Turbo S in 2.6sec, Charger Redeye in 3.6sec. It's not even mentionned in the video but the Doug score is 9 in acceleration. The Charger Redeye is only best in term of top speed, 203mph against 163 and 161 for the Model S Performance and Taycan Turbo S.  The Model S Performance is a few thousands dollars more expensive but you get more security with 4 wheels drive, it's way more luxurious, you can use it as a daily, and it comes with the best technologies available. It is faster on acceleration, on circuit, and basically everywhere except in long straight lines... Where exactly are you supposed to enjoy "safely" your Charger Redeye at 200mph if not on a empty airtstrip or a german Autobahn ?  What Doug doesn't mention is that the only benefice of the Charger Redeye is the feeling and attention you get with the sound, you can't get that with an EV. Also I guess some guys are going to upgrade the engine to reach 1000HP and you can not really upgrade the performance of an EV.
Sweet engine terrible interior.
Let’s see how reliable this car will be 10 years down the road.
I went to buy one... Sat in it... Wasn't feeling it.  I moved on to pursuing a used Jag F-Type SVR....  It just doesn't feel worth it, and you can't test drive it.  I'd rather buy something else, purchase the crate motor and have to swapped, or buy one with low miles in a few years.
And 0 people who own this will be responsible enough to handle that kind of power...
How many scrolled straight to the driving portion of the review? lol
A $30,000 car with a $60,000 powertrain.
I cannot stop thinking about the color combo I love it so much. Peanut Butter and Jelly Charger.
Thisssss, doesen't give you that this or even that, just like any other in this price point, but it will give you 800hp 1000Nm torque over 300kph no other gives that :-)
As a main channel viewer and a challenger owner, thank you for putting this on the More page.
In Kia K5  or Huindai Sonata for 25k you get a lot more luxury inside then this hehehe, but I get it it’s about the engine which is nice but NOT for me.
imagine a charger demon 😂
Dodges solution to old outdated cars is simply "MO POWA BABY"
Dodge is the ONLY car company making cars that aren’t DOG SHIT. They make CAT SHIT
The car is cool with crazy specs BUT tell people how these cars don’t hold up , there resale is awful, and there a money pit long term

My man Doug reviewing 2 cars in one trip
Dodge made a mistake.  That hood wasn’t even painted.  I’d feel ripped off if I spent $90,000 and these still didn’t get paint on the hood.  So cheap.
Doug is it the fastest sedan in existence? You weren't clear about that.
So basically. Nothing changed since like  2009. Gotcha
Rolls Royce executives watching Doug reach for the door handles: *"Peasant"*
Please review a Ford crown victoria police interceptor! It is a living legend!
That's not the fastest. Brabus Rocket 900 is faster and more powerful than that.
From donut media James I think he says MO POWER BABY
what should we give you for 10 k extra? no powa baby!
90k car that goes 200+ miles per hour with stock rotors? Really crapler? I better see Brembo brakes and cross-drilled rotors for that price. Get with the program and learn how to install brakes that work with the performance of the car.
Anyone know about junkyard dave's build Doug should review it when it's done even tho it's custom
Is that Organik's car?
Adaptive cruise control and a wireless phone charger are options on the car just an fyi
I think Brabus Rocket 900 (S65) is a bit faster reaching 350 kmh... but also cost like 5 times more than that Charger haha.
I'm genuinely concerned about Doug's knees
Doug should do a video for cars on Cars And Bids... Doug could charge a nice fee to this extra option.  Who wouldn’t pay Doug a thousand for that option to their listing.
my 2011 charger rt has automatic wipers 😉

Um , it isn't.  The fastest sedan in the world is actually the Alpina B7 . It can do 206 mph (331.5 km/h), so you're wrong there Doug , sorry .
I love what FCA had been doing lately but how tf are they passing emissions lmao?
...in a straight line.
Mopar be killin it these days lol
8:52 i wish donut media’s iconic moor pawahhh babyyy
6:14 Sounds like a Koenigsegg ☺️
The perfect car. Has 800hp and a loud exhaust for dad and has 4 doors and a back seat for Mom and the kids. What more could you ask for?
Fastest sedan? Not quite.
These will be a great used car bargain in a couple years
i believe the 760li unlimited is few mph faster
@8:50 No powa babeh!!
Just call them 800HP
Just wonder how much power they gonna put in a 2 tonn sedan before it gets an AWD
dodge is making a b*tch out of every other american automaker
Anybody else miss plum crazy?  Best color ever.  Btw, you can get the door sill and the adaptive cruise and nicer backup camera on the charger.  You just have to get the packages.  The car you're driving doesn't come with them.
Honestly, the lack of effort in the interior makes me wanna get something else at the same price point.
2021 Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat Redeye Is the World’s biggest Car Name
Doug thats actually quite offensive. On a track and accelaration the fastest sedan is the M5 competition. Top speed even though BMW claim 305kph its around 320kph so the same as that hellcat, but has a faster 1/4 mile and is faster on track. Edit: before people say ok but this has 800hp the bmw only has 625. On paper yes but truth is Dodges hp numbers are usually the same on the dyno as on paper sometimes even 20-30hp less. While the M5 pushes out up to 700hp on a dyno. With its much cleverer awd, chasis, and springs. Then it starts to make sense.
Correction: the bentley flying spur W12 goes 207 mph, that's the fastest sedan :P
Just wait for the charger demon lol
Could tell by the number of churches you passed you were here in the QC.
"fastest car" Maybach Brabus Rocket 900 v12 1500 Nm & 350+ km/h: *Are you serius?*
Chrysler ain’t playing around anymore
What is that interior color? I was expecting a dark sporty interior with carbon fiber and red stitching and instead it’s an old man tan.
everyone: you can't just put a big engine in your entire range dodge: haha hellcat go vrooom
Where was this filmed? San Diego ain't got this type of fall!! So beautiful with the leafs falling and dense trees!
Tesla model s plaid is fasted tho 1100hp 0-60 <2sec
Doesn’t the Taycan accelerate faster? Is a Taycan’s top speed lower because it’s governed or because it actually can’t go faster (regardless of damage to the car)?
Adaptive cruise as an OPTION and it's been since 2011 for the Charger
9:30 power sound
PB&J spec
Inside peanut butter outside jelly... Seven days of the week, seven different Chevies. I mean Dodges.
So funny he is selling an Allroad on his bid site which he said was the 2nd worst car ever made.
How much longer do y'all think they are gonna milk the life out of the current gen Charger/Challenger and the Grand Cherokee?  I feel like they're getting up there life the Nissan Frontier.
Those are some nice houses!
Doug with cars like this, just do a sentence, then turn the ignition on, let us listen for a minute, only after that tell us what you want lol  I have difficulty understanding what you are saying, I want to hear the engine, dont make me fast forward :))
The charger can be had with adaptive cruise, forward collision, lane assist, and auto wipers. Hellcats dont because those systems get in the way of cooling..dodge said that over 5 years ago surprising u didn’t know that.  Also, the materials were updated with stitching on the doors and dash and a different material also. People are so full of it. It’s 90k.... that’s a BARGAIN! name me a car with a better interior with the same power for the same price Doug? NEW
I love the color <3 . Beatiful !
Yeah the hellcat is cool and all but can we admire the xj Cherokee shirt?
Hell rasin..  Best marketing team
10.6 seconds out of factory is....*gulp* good! I could barely make 12.3 with a highly modded out, nitrous oxide kitted, illegal to use on the road (did anyway), car back in the early 90's. I like this.
10:30 LOL Just got back from a grocery run in my challenger hellcat, and I got the  “Hay do a burn out”.     I had to oblige
90k gets me a faster and nicer C8. Bad value in my opinion.

Dodge are compensating their lack of quality with those massive engines and they’re getting away with it...
cop: do you know why i pulled you over today sir ?  charger owner (that went over 200 mph) : cuz i let u
Warning, incoming Tesla fans. Be on the lookout for theoretical numbers, models that haven't released, and idol worship.
Dodge is the car company that puts 800 horsepower in a budget sedan and paints it like a PB&J sandwich. Just epic.
I own a 09 Charger. And I live in the South. When I went back home to PA, I went to the local Dodge dealership and they like had 2 Chargers/Challengers. He said they weren't that popular due to the snow etc. I guess that much power in a snow is useless. Shortest review I've ever seen u do, Doug.
Isn't the E60 M5 still the fastest sedan in the world? Made way back and it'll hit 205 whereas this will only do 202 in the skinny version. The widebody can't even crack 200.
6:13 sounds like my honda accord when someone stole my catalytic converter.
bmw m5 competition left the chat
World's fastest sedan? Nah. The rental charger you were talking about is actually the fastest.
Wireless charger ? With 800HP I can get home faster then my phone dies
I alway wonder what people behind doug at a stoplight think of, when he just screams at his camera with his hands in the air.
Trackhawk is the best version of this concept to me. AWD, SUV practicality with 700 hp lol
I want to hear Doug say "THIIIIIISSSSSSS.... IS SPARTA!"
I've always thought the BRABUS Rocket 900 S-Class was the fastest sedan...
Anyone ever look to see if he films the car and his Cars & Bid opening on the same day? Just me? 🤦‍♂️ Well today it looks like we have a winner. Doug has the same shirt on. 😂
90000 for 700 HP and extremely outdated technology? Any car enthusiast would buy an older  Japanese that can make easily 1000 HP for less than half of what this plastic shit cost
i love this car
That Hell Rasin paint is probably the best color on this car
Dodge is trying to keep the old retro style then again they're making it for cops especially cops don't need high tech car's 🤣
Automatic Cruise Control, Automatic sensing wipers, etc. = not important when you have 800hp Cheap glove box latch = deal breaker :)
That car does have rain sensors and auto wipers. Intermittent setting is auto on all Chrysler products.  I can tell from  the big sensor behind the mirror
Flying Spur does 207
What were you doing in Charlotte? I would’ve lost my mind if I ran into THE DADDY DOUG in my city
If this was a tier on the Chrysler 300 then I want it!
Now the red eye is actually the second fastest in the world, it’s top speed is 203mph while the Bentley flying spur is 207mph
Yeah 90 hp improvement. Just as my 2008 Toyota Auris
🎶Inside peanut butter outside jelly🎶
Do car's really need that much power? Soon we'll have aircraft on land racing then the streets wouldn't be safe for folks to walk again
Before buying this, call Brabus.
The doors open so far for very fat Americans.
I would buy this exact version!!
it's not the fastest . now if remapping  BMW m5  it will put out 800 hp and 1000 nm and will go over to 200 mph
My 2019 Fiat Tipo has a very similar steering wheel... It's something!
They just keep avoiding making a Charger Demon
*Look at my 2004 taurus*  No I have the fastest sedan
I love the absurdity of the Redeye however my Proctologist gives it a thumbs down for the name!
Okay I'm getting tired of car reviewers bagging on the Charger/Challenger's interior.  The BMW M5 has the same interior as a base level 530i minus a couple of items yet no one complains about *that.*  Other than GMC with the Denali trim of the new Yukon, car manufacturers are not going to spend $$$$ putting in a different interior for each trim of car.  Besides, you don't buy this car for the interior.... you buy it for that nearly 800hp HEMI.
Yeah it's not a loud enough for me so if I ever get a charger redeye I am definitely getting a mid-muffler delete right after I leave the dealership cuz I want to be heard and I want to make people go to deaf
Flying Spur does 207 mph....
Jeremy Clarkson: "PowAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
8:24, that transition was GOLD
For that money you buy a new audi A8L 4.2 tdi in europe
I mean The Gemera is a sedan, so it is the fastest Hyper sedan in the world.. the tesla model s performance is a sedan and it is faster.. I really suspect this car can make 1/4 mile in 10.6s. I might be wrong though
I'll have a really nice used E63 AMG for 90-large--easily tuned to run mid-10s, and with an interior actually fitting its price tag.
Wheels are too small
The reason the door opens so wide is because all the people who buy these cars are 300lbs+. They are big boys who need a big opening to fit into lol
Doug is a bit too comfortable being on his knees on the asphalt.👀
I can run the 1/4 mile in 1 minute, so the car is only 6 times faster. :-)
The best doug-videos in years. EVERYBODY buys a camera and a microphone and tells for gps screen and another gps screen and 200% autonomy car… Buy ipad pro (Technology) and move you’re self from point A to point B, BY BUS (literally autonomy drive) . BUT the so(doug)crates has TALENT not advertise screens! The king is back!!!
I've the Charger Hellcall in that same color, except from the year it came out. Still running like new.
Pretty clear these cars are keeping the brand alive. The costs surely aren't funding innovation or research in any way. Dodge has been able to make a 800hp street car for 60 years.
I thought bentley flying spur w12 was fastest sedan on earth  Then I thought it was brabus 900 rocket  What bs is this doug?
These should be the police cars in the next Need for Speed.
She fast but she heavy as fuck
I personally think that the fun factor and cool factor should have been higher
Is this engine same as the one in TRX??
He got a proper mic after years ? Imam amazed
is that a jeep xj on his t shirt
Fastest till the flawed hemi redesign blows up...
5:42 so you don't open the door wide open like a Doug would do god damn it!
If this car was a person, it would be Jeremy Clarkson.
I’m excited for the Durango tho
I can’t get over how bad those door handles are, eyes drawn to it, shocking. Otherwise mental car.
"more powah" is clearly a donut media reference
Isn't this a reupload?
Did you forget that the Chevy Camaro Z28 has 305/30ZR19 on all four tires.
I must say that color "Hellraisin" is gorgeous.
Ewww that interior!
Wrong , nothings faster than when you need to eat a yellow light
Shit is not worth 90k
At what point is "Cars and Bids" no longer "new"?
save your 90g go get yourself a German car, the cheapest German car is far better than any Dodge or Ford.
Doug impersonating people: WE WANT MORE POWER Donut: you can't say More Poweh without the Baby!!
Doug the kind of guy to do a consecutive lineup of car manufacturer.
Doug!  I’m still wanting that p100d model s.
Im in love with it I WANT ONE
The way Doug orgasms is heavenly.
Dodge makes thee most American muscle cars still.
This car is going to be very popular in Atlanta.

His hand spread when presenting Cars and Bids seems to be getting wider with each video 😂😂😂😂😂
I have a feeling, by the end of the decade, we will see a Dodge Charger with a thousand horsepower. A Dodge Charger with as much, if not more power than a Bugatti Veyron. Now THAT would be completely insane. And wouldn’t cost the however many million bucks one of those do.
civic is faster p.s. if you want power - just buy kingdom
Doug: this is the fastest sedan  Bentley flying spur: am I a joke to you?
This Charger is awesome, really really awesome! Thanks for the the review Doug.
Aren't there Brabus Sedans that are faster? Or do they not really count because they're not really production cars?
The 2021 Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat Redeye:  The best version of the 1998 Mercedes E-series yet.

i do enjoy when the rear lets loose. thats one thing i appreciate about driving these hulks
More Powahh Baby!!!
Is it faster then the demon ?
That back end needs lowered, Christ on a bike it’s higher than shaggy when he has a Scooby snack
I love watching Doug's hips continue to get wider than his chest. Soon he'll have to discuss seat width as a quirk
I think dodge should utilize chrysler as a brand and make it actually nice. It'd be a 120k sedan, but then throw the AWD out of the jeep in it along with an up to date interior, it'd be pure insanity.
the old E60 M5 does 207 MPH lol🤦‍♀️
9:56 how Doug looks like when his hitting it
But the Paris Climate Accord
Hi friends. Have you ever thought about where you'll spend eternity? It's the most important question you will ever consider. We have all broken God's moral law - the 10 commandments. This is also why we need Jesus Christ as our personal Savior. Can I ask you some questions my friend? How many lies have you told in your life? What do we call someone who tells lies? A liar. Have you ever stolen something? What do we call someone who steals? A thief. Have you ever taken God's name in vain? God said He will not hold harmless those who misuse His name. Jesus said if a man even looks at a woman with lust in his heart then he's already committed adultery with her in his heart. Have you ever looked with lust my friend? This is just 4 out of the 10 commandments that we have broken. Since we have broken God's moral law, we deserve to be separated from God forever in hell. But God in His love sent His Son Jesus to die for my sin and your sin my friend. To have your sins forgiven and have eternal life place your faith in Jesus just like you would a parachute when having to jump out of an airplane at 30,000 feet. You can't just believe in the parachute you have to place your faith in it by putting it on. After you pray to receive Jesus read John 3 and 4. Then read the Bible every single day of your life no matter what and also pray that God will help you understand what you read. Please, please, please think about this my friend. Judgment is coming and this is how you get prepared.
Really diggin’ the PB&J color combo
I think some of the stuff that was missing was either for weight reduction or just not optioned on
Had to break it but it's not the fastest sedan in the world 😐
mo powah babey
A Charger without a wireless charger...
I appreciate the honesty, if u want a car with a nice interior and some performance this isnt your car, if you want stupid fast performance this is your car
those cartoonish widebody panels make it look like a VW Beetle
Ay I heard you like cars and bids so i made a cars and bids website to see cars and bids at carsandbids.com
Ez
Lipstick  on a pig 🐖
....and it looks like an ugly box
You should review the challenger hedeye
Doug the fastest saloon car in the world is a Bentley flying spur at 207 MPH
mr doug sir please review the toyota tacomas water pump gasket
It does have auto wipers and adaptive cruise control its just a extra option 🤦🏾‍♂️
If YouTube has thought us anything is that if you want 10 second performance you buy almost any car for $20k, throw in a few thousand dollars in parts, and a few grand in labor, and keep doing that for years and you'll have way more power and still spend less than on a stock crap charger.
Dodge follows Tim Allens motto, "MORE POWER! RRR RRR RRR"
Ok 90k.FOR. 2021 Y’all better. Do a. AWD. CHARGER RED EYE. Or. Wide body TRACKHAWK

SRT means?
You should take a db meter with you and messure all cars sound levels from about 1 meter away from now on.
Next up the durango srt hellcat 😎
Dodge is F*cking insane, and I love it!
Bentley flying spur goes higher speeds, and tesla does faster 1/4 s
Give us a Hellcat Grand Caravan you cowards!
Tesla owners will download the latest app to upgrade
The only thing that's nice about the interior is definitely the seats and the colour
Well being a molar guy I have to get a new molar product every so often I know what I must have 😂
Actually, the fastest sedan as of this posting is the bentley flying spur at 207 mph. But the charger redeye is the most powerful sedan in the world
They don't want to sell that car! Who is going to buy such a car lacking everything!!!
Lets go around a band
You don't have a lot of technology features on this car which other cars at this price point have, but other sedans at this price point doesn't have 800 freaking horsepower
At least the interior color matches the brake calipers
Door opens all the way for the big bois
Really cool, now we need the Hennessey version
That's a lot of money, for the luxury of a dumptruck...
I would've call that colour 'Hellmorrhoid'
Listen to the purr of this cat 6:06
Imagine seeing this car and screaming "DO A BURNOUT!" And then seeing Doug inside.   And then imagine seeing Doug actually doing it :O I bet he did it off camera, like come on, being behind a wheel of this monster and not even trying to do one. Impossible. A grandma would try it
What a crap of a car. Chrysler never stops making garbage cars and then go ask government money
Love the colors!
Everybody: downsizing for fuel economy  Chrysler: *HELLCAT EVERYTHING*
8:26 that transition was actually really clean
That's an ugly color and the car itself was obsolete in terms of tech 3 years ago
4 Doug videos in 1 week?   Ahh, Heaven🤤
One question Doug- would YOU drive this car 200 mph on the Autobahn?
The Bentley flying spur would like to have a word!?!??!
He's still doing the voodoo thing with his hands up in the air to hypnotize people to go to cars and bids
Give me a Hellcat 9mm & Hellcat Red eye!!
Wonder how long before you can get 1000 hp from the local dodge dealer.....
800 horsepower and 200+ mp/h....who cares about the color combination 😄😄😄
Next up: Hellcat Pink Eye
Soon enough these sort of cars are going to be outlawed.
I can't keep up with these names Dodge! SRT8 Hellcat Demon Widebody Redeye
The Bentley flying spur can do 207 from the factory ??
i had ride in dodge charger GT is was awesome
Imagine breaking into dougs House. Suddenly the lights come on and you just hear "This is a remmington 870 shotgun" doug then describes the gun in detail and expands on its quirks and features
Sorry Doug but the Koenigsegg Gemera has 1000bhp and will hit 248mph. That is the fastest 4 seater on the planet. Even the Brabus rocket 800 which is also a four door sedan is faster.
I got even more excited when I saw him standing next to that durango cat, can’t wait for that video
Is it actually the fastest in terms of acceleration?  These have hugely powerful engines, but they are limited by traction so trying to accelerate becomes an exercise in hilarity,  which is exactly the point of this car.
How is this car even legal??? Can you imagine an 18 year old financing this car?
Loving the bump in FCA products
"Better High Performance" is a debatable claim after what I have seen happen to some of these high powered Chrysler cars. Its funny, one of the worst companies for quality control and has been for a long time, making extremely high powered vehicles. I'm not saying they arent selling or havent a place, but I have never had good luck with Chrysler reliability.
Maserati 4porte Trofeo is faster, 326km/h...
They would say: MOE PAOWAH BABY
It really does need a technology and feature update. Not more engine power.
Next up is the charger demon
reality: this is truly the fastest sedan in the world  my 00s brain: my turbobrick can take on anyone
Oh God, Doug's reviewing an SRT again. RIP Doug.
For some reason I doubted the title even before watching the video.
Have to respect Chrysler company by making these engines from factory!
Just ate a whopper w cheese and bacon, that ish hit the spot. Hella good
i'm so in love with this car 🔥
You press on the gas like a mom Doug step on it like a man

9:57 doug has a douggasm
Doug is the type of guy to review his wife.
I typically like purple... but not barney colored
Dodge is going places 💯
I have a $70K truck and doesn't have any of those amenities you talked about, and I don't care either. My truck works, and I imagine folks should get back to that.
Dear FCA,  I know it's not a priority for you but you can change the outdated interior dash design without changing the iconic timeless looking of the Charger and Challenger.
Color combo =- peanut butter and jelly.
In 2032 somewhere in the world... Nobody:   Doug: Thissss...is the new doge SRT hellcat redeye and now it does have 1200 hp and it’s just insane...
It does have automatic wipers...
Every Audi RS-anything with the speed limiter disabled laughs in the Charger's face.
my 06 chrysler 300 has auto wipers😂but if i was driving this i wouldnt care at all
World's fastest sedan on paper in real world the M5 Comp and the E63S detroy this car easy!
best color hands down. beautiful car
And it’s one of the most carjacked cars here in Chicago
Still a Dodge 😂 my neighbor lemon lawed his 2020 a month ago. Turns out the reason they gave it 790 hp is to make sure you can coast all the way to the dealership when it breaks. Good thinking
Daddy Doug is trying to sneak in the good reviews for the real fans 😁
So the car is colored peanut butter and jelly?
From a base model to a hellcat, even with the cheap plastics people are buying these like crazy
All the interior features you listed that it doesn’t have, are actually all options on more expensive packages of that car
You have got to give credit to FCA for producing some mind-boggling automobiles. Creativity and fun factor is off the charts. Not everyone cares about the interior bells and whistles, that's for sure.
Peanut butter and jelly spec
But this is why we love dodge. Purely for the lack of fucks that they give
Really nice review, good job Doug
you have to do some tradeoffs for the horsepower. i would go horsepower all day than tech stuff.
I wonder if I can swap out my insurance from my 1999 Ford fiesta to this?  I wonder how much it will cost will I have to sell a kidney?
That right there is my dream car or the challenger i won’t mind
Hearing the supercharger whine in person is an incredible experience unlike any other car... I hope everyone can go for a ride in a hellcat someday lmao
It is NOT the fastest sedan on the planet... The G Power V10 M5 goes 372kph or 231 mph.
I love the colour
I wasnt subscribed to your second channel. Come arrest me.
I’m not a fan of this car.
Oh man, I’ve been waiting for this car
FCA really needs to spend money to develop a robust AWD system already. The weak crap in the V6 models would snap like a twig, but these Hellcats neeeeeeeeed AWD so badly to put the power down fast.
I hope Jaguar makes another faster sedan, like the XE SV Project 8
ITS ALMOST DOUGCEMBER WE SEE THAT DURANGO!!
For the life of me I can't understand why something so ugly would need to go so fast.
Doug seems to be going a Mopar fan..
Why is this not on his main Chanel is this car not worthy enough to be in the main Chanel
Devil's car, you should say: Oh my Demon! 800 Hp pushing you to hell
More Power, Baby!
8:50 more POWER baby - a really handsome man who loves buff horses
When Doug said he was in Charlotte my eyes opened so wide
This should of been on the main channal
"Mo powa baby"
“The worlds fastest sedan”.  My 1997 Rollscanhardly (rolls down a hill, can hardly get up the next) begs to differ😏
seems like Doug changed his middle name to "hellcat" for this week
It might be faster than a Ferrari f40 but it's no Ferrari
I need more money...  so much more money...
Imagine all the Doug DeMuro Youtube Poop videos where he says Peanut Butter
Doug has been pumping out some good ones lately. Love it!
American Police departments has entered the chat* 👁👁
When I go to buy a car I don’t ask for a CarFax. I ask the Doug Score.
And about as reliable as a Ferrari also
MPG has left the chat
Toyota: “We’ve improved our hybrid technology across our product range for more fuel efficiency”  Mercedes: “We’ve achieved even greater levels of refinement and comfort using the finest materials and German engineering”  Dodge: “MORE POWERRRRRRRRRR!!!!”
They forgot to paint the hood! Those lazy FCA factory workers 😛
Is the worlds fastest sedan, in a straight line
Although this awesome Charger is insanely fast but isn't the new Bentley Flying Spur a couple of miles faster (207 mph) making it the fastest sedan. Though the I guess their in extremely different price points.
I like those colors, today's car colors are so lame.
MO POWAH BEBE!!!
The Doug full sentence when he begain to talk. "but befor i get started,check out cars and bids"
The Dodge Intrepid has come a long way...
Dodge engineers be like: Hmmmm, Hellcat engine and 700+ horsepower for every model is what people want
"90 more horsepower than the wide body". You mean the "regular Hellcat". ALL Charger Hellcats and Redeye's are "wide body".
fastest top speed vs fastest 1/4 mile vs fastest 0-60 vs fastest Nurburgring vs fastest of a specific track?
That's not a good color.
Car of choice for unemployment scammers.
How can this car get by with such a small grill but a Lexus needs that huge one?
DURANGO SRT HELLCAT POG
Why did you stop reviewing houses?
Wait so this is faster than the demon?
I want one # 🚗 🚘
What about alpina B7, doesn’t it go over 200mph, over 330kph as well?
Serious Question:  What's the endurance on these cars?  Will they get to 200k miles?  That's my biggest fear with buying them, they'll have problems every 10k miles...
The color combo just reminds me of Peanut butter & Jelly. Its a driving sandwich.
If you buy this car you don't give a crap about all the bells and whistles. Does it go fast, yeah it does!
The front doors open that way bc it is intended for the police package chargers for a defense positioning as well as the package included a armed doors for the front doors only
8:48   Mo powah babahhh!!!!
Finaly some car I like
What if dodge made a charger version of the demon
It probably does have auto wipers. My '15 Challenger does. They have to be enabled through the uconnect screen then the wipers are left anywhere in the intermittent position.
Man it would be awesome if dodge focused on making good/ reliable cars and not fast but shit quality boats.
This is NOT the fastest production sedan in the world by any stretch of the imagination. The Bentley Flying Spur is a much faster sedan. The Alpina B7 is also a much much faster sedan, although I'm not sure if it qualifies as a true production car.
TTHHHIIIIIIIIIIISSSSSS
Every body gangsta even the hellcat till the Doug say"befor i get started, check out cars and bids"
Who remembers the near death experience Doug had with the white dodge?
Doug: The Dodge Charger is the fastest sedan in the world  Flying Spur: laughs in 207 mph
Ugly! Typical cheap Dodge.
Dodge. Keeping American True with Their Truebreed Muscle cars
800hp and he probably didn't get over 35mph, a single cylinder moped can do that.
Good thing he didn't say "more power" three times in a row cuz would have summoned James Pumphrey. MOAH POWAHH BABEH
Mopar or no car Dodge nailed it In the Hell Raisin purple They truly impaled it You don't need cruise control when acceleration is your goal That's why you drive it like it's stole Cuz it wrenches you out any hole Who cares about a cheap interior when the exterior make's the competition inferior Pretenders are irrelevant in the rear view mirror
Me in my lil Altima YOU WANNA SEE SOME REAL SPEED
8:50 mo powah babeh
Thats Baby Pooh interior, not peanut butter
Just look at the stance of this bad boy, aggressive af
I’m pretty sure my 2008 Dodge Charger 3.5 V6 is the fastest sedan in the world
6:15 It actually sounds like it's growling Wow
I hope FCA/Stellantis never abandons this formula.  So what if the LX cars are large, heavy, or on a "dated" platform. The size gives them a practicality advantage, most enthusiast cars will be "too heavy" for journalists and commentators, and a "dated" platform means plenty of time for mfg kinks to be worked out plus available replacement parts.  I am concerned that FCA will listen to the worst critics and the next LX cars will change too much, losing the underdog character that makes the current Charger and Challenger popular.  Can some features be brought current? Of course.  In fact, the real travesty is how the Chrysler 300 was allowed to wither on the vine. If anything THAT should be the refined, feature-laden car.   While replacements are inevitable, I hope Carlos Tavares remembers that Alfa Romeo and Maserati are there to appeal to the Euro snobs, not Dodge. I hope the next Charger/Challenger doesn't try too hard to please everyone.
Doug is the type of guy to tell you about cars and bids
Is it weird that the sound of a big V8 at idle puts me at complete ease? It's like putting on a sounds of nature ambient sound machine.
Is this Chrysler's way to give the middle finger to the Paris Accord? Just Hellcat-ing all of their cars.
PB J Charger
Big fan of the channel. Keep up the good work :) Suggestion: Hire somebody to take outside shots when you are going for a drive. I always skip the last few minutes as it gets too boring with a single angle shot.
Even in America you’d look like a total dick in that Trump-mobile. It’s like that car Homer Simpson designed.
I kinda dig the PB&J spec on this Hellcat tbh
M5 and M8 and AMG GT 4 door sedans would kill these American slow ass boats 🤷🏻‍♂️
We need a Prowler Hellcat
Its hilarious to think that deep deep down, this Charger is still a W211 Merc.
Didn't the 2015 Charger Hellcat go 204 mph?
I don’t like the widebody, i think it looks slow 😬
The outline of the scoop should have been painted red. In my humble opinion.
This is my dream daily driver 🏁🇺🇸 and that new color "hell raisin" is also the perfect fit 💜
Porsche Taycan Turbo S: Am I a joke to you?
Am I the only one that gets more excited about cars like this rather than exotic super cars?!
3:51 The car is enough to bring any man to his knees.
the Taycan does the quarter mile faster so that is the fastest sedan
Its time for a complete redesign of the charger from the interior down to the platform
I am pretty sure the Brabus 900 is the fastets sedan on the planet. As the name suggests it has 900 hp and a top speed of 220mph.
I don’t think a lot of power is a good idea there’s a a lot of them at Copart they need to give lessons first before u buy
I really want this car but I know  I shouldn't.
Peanut butter and jelly spec
I like how the coolant color matches the body color.
I like how the coolant color matches the paint @ 2:31
When he said he was in Charlotte I started looking out the windows and recognizing houses
Yes dodge makes fast cars... But they also make extremely unreliable cars.... Sooooo.... 🤷‍♂️
It’s PBJ in automotive form.
I bet most European fast sedans would destroy it round a track. fastest down a dragstrip is boring
What about the Alpina B5/B7? Aren't they faster?
The Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat is actually my dream car. Well not the Redeye, just the regular ones.
bmw: boosting the power of the m5 by  100 in 16 years. (not even a joke) dodge: 375 hp more than the 2005 srt8. 375!!!!
AFAIK the fastest sedan in the world right now is the 'Brabus Rocket 900'.
MOPAR's muscle car formula has always been taxi cab spec cars with big engines.
The Dogde is cool but I'd still rather had an M5.
Brabus rocket is the fastest sedan actually
doug is this fasted than the M8 competition grand coupe? that car hits 325km too
I feel like Doug will buy a 6.2hemi 700hp+dodge at some point
doug the type of guy to bag his charger hellcat widebody
Inside peanut butter outside jelly
All that power but no traction.
PB&J
Mopar = They always knew people wants "more power"
me looking at my Lada 1300 with 5 speed Fiat gearbox: ok
Anyone else notice that he NEVER links to his related car video in the description 🤣
They should have called it the supercharger
The world's fastest sedan.... mainly owned by people with mediocre driving skills.
good morning Doug. nice vid. liked b4 watching b/c  i knew it was going to be good
Purple (grape) over peanut butter? That's a PB&J
Those flared fenders kinda make me think of a completely overblown RX-8 with four full-sized doors from the side view.
8:50 I was 100% Expecting Doug to say MO POWAH BABY
Peanut butter hell raising car just like my sandwich made in 10 seconds.
Great video but I thought the new Bentley Flying Spur Speed is the fastest sedan in the world? (207 Mph top speed)
To put it bluntly : MORE POWER BAAYBEH
PB& J 👀
800 hp car cheap plastic no features...🤔I pass
How can an 800 hp $90k car NOT be a great value?
Too bad the reliability of Dodge is complete GARBAGE.
In a world of 50 shades of gray cars (black gray silver white) thank god we still see something with colour.
Every young boy fan like👁👄👁😠
MO POWER BABEY
Please do a longer drive impression of a car like this!
"The ultimate Dodge Charger...for now."
Mooooo powaaa BABY
MO' POWAAAH BABEH
And looks god awful
Dodge is doing it right
MORE POWER
0 to 60 mph?
While Chey and Ford are trying to strap turbos on one liter engines Dodge is being awesome.
When the supercharger is louder than some cars you know you did a good job making a car
The fastest sedan is actually my Honda Civic with an exhaust delete
doug: fastest sedan on the planet bentlet flying spur w12 : am i joke to you ? ( cries while passing srt hellcat at 340 kph )
The statement of you owning the fastest factory sedan in production is enough to justify the price
Review the 1998 lincoln mark viii collectors edition!
I'm ashamed to say I love this car!!!
The worlds fastest PB&J
When they name this a widebody, they are talking about the shape of the people who drive it.  (hence the wide opening doors)
Who needs a wireless charger when you have 797 horsepower under the hood of the world fastest four dour sedan?!
M5 Competition then the The Red Eye Charger
Imagine if the cops started using this
Why did this video feel so short ..
Doug is the type of guy to review drive an 800 hp beast around residential side streets.
Doug: *reviews 2019 wide body and complained about piss poor interior* Dodge: change nothing!!
Isn't the Bentley Flying Spur the fastest?
Does doug ever put links to other videos in the description?
Lol the fastest. I bet a Tesla Model S will eat it for breakfast on a drag.
Doug the type of guy to question why a purple car is named....Red Eye. #THIISSSSSS!
Even the coolant is plum crazy purple
2:52  literally nobody: The engineers over at Tesla: and?
In 2040: This is the Dodge float, it does 0-200 mph in a millisecond, marching its way to light speed in 5 seconds.
I kinda like that interior color.
Brabus rocket 900 is the fastest sedan I don't care what nobody say stop saying Hellcat are
All I want for christmas is quirks and features
That color combo... Peanut butter jelly time! Peanut butter jelly time!
The world: lets down or emission and fuel consumption  Murica: 800hp sedan to do grocery
Getting famous off comments day 15🤙🤙🤙
I see you’ve been working out Doug ;)
Inside peanut butter outside jelly.
I can't wait till they give it AWD so it can actually use thay power
I love this car
That ish ugly. I don’t like the wide body looks like a ugly beetle.
The front suspension on that Jeep has collapsed..
Also made a Donut reference
Why on "More" ?  Seems ready for prime time.
Doug the type of guy to turn on turn signals 5 blocks before the turn
Oooooo.  Hellcat Durango 🤔
Someone correct me but he keeps saying “over 200mph” and yet the e60 m5 could do 200mph
Can't wait to see Matt F drive this thing
8:50 MO POWAH BEBEH - james pumphry
M5 Competition says no!
Sooo basically it's a 4 door Demon...
The Bentley Flying Spur is the fastest new sedan at 207mph.
No automatic windshield wipers? Well that's one think my 2013 Charger R/T has that this doesn't.
Wow!   That is some crazy power!  Thanks for the video.
A Vin Diésel certified car. 💪
"This is the 2025 Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat Redeye Widerbody"
You mean the gemera
I’m surprised Doug was able to open up the throttle even that much in Charlotte. As a resident I’m jealous lol.
At the Dodge dealership: So what color would you want sir?  Me: Give me the PB & J
The color belongs on a PT Cruiser. Blech.
Isn't the demon technically faster then this though?
Bro the fastest saloon/sedan was the flying spur
I can't wait 3 years when these are in the low 40s, I should be able to deal with 2 mpg by then lol
That interior looks so damn cheap🙄. FMC's answer to poor build quality....add more power.
the 2020 Bentley Flying Spur is faster at 207 mph, compared to the Charger Hellcat Redeye's 203.
The white line on the wiper stock is a range of how automatic you want the wipers. Thicker = faster
Money no object, I’d get it for the speed and power! That exhaust note is thrilling.
Hellrasin PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME
I think this should have came with the dual hood scoops
I love that color combo ngl. I also find "Hellraisin'" really funny.
no match for hemi power
+* ok ! 🖤 brand ++** new srt * ok  !+ok ++**  * slatt _ !
I don't see how that thing doesn't go airborne at 200 mph.
If I’ll move one day in usa/Canada I would buy a Dodge Charger widebody and a Ford Bronco
Should be priced at 60k given everything else other than the engine, is cheap.
World's fastest sedan.... on a straight line only
It's the PB&J Charger Red Eye!
Saying a modern car is "faster than a ferrari F40" is a little bit like saying "your smartphone is more powerful than the NASA computer used to do the moon landing". I mean, sure it is, it's been like 200 years since that thing was built :D
Anyone else watch this video and think damn I can't wait until that durango hellcat video drops this upcoming week
quickest or fastest ??
They keep making these cars better and better. Chevy hasn’t done much to the Camaro to keep it interesting. This Hellraisin color grew on me. I prefer plum crazy though
Its messured in gallons per mile 💀
At 9:55 was that a cop or security? Either way doug gave no f's and still sent it.
If you're counting top speeds, then the Bentley Continental flying spur is faster (207Mph)
Great Video! Couple things though, It likely has auto wipers you just turn them on in the infotainment settings. Also Adaptive Cruise Control is an option.. but yeah at 90k it should have been on it.
I absolutely love that you can get a 797hp peanut butter and jelly car in 2020
Glad I'm one of the first to view an epic video on a record-breaking perfirmance vehicle. 797hp 203mph 10.6 1/4 mile
the charger is the m5 of america 🏁
It might be the fastest sedan but the new turbo s runs very low tens in the 1/4 mile, and American cars are meant for the strip
MO’ POWAH BABEH
This isn't the fastest sedan in the world because the Bentley Flying Spur can do 207 mph
doug: this is the fastest seda civic owners: hmph (thinking bout v tech)
5:38 'You cannot reach without doing something insane'    XD
What is that poo interior
Now i want a damn pb&j sandwich!
Dodge proves that people just want MOAR POWA BAAAABY!
A top speed more than a hundred miles per hour over what the car's country of origin allows on the road...  Pity.
Did you post this on the wrong channel Doug?
Faster than a Ferrari F40... in a straight line. :p
Moh Powah baby!
In 10 years it'll go for 4,000$.
The doors open wide to accommodate the extra large crack dealers who drive them
Doug is the kind of guy to provide an eargasm at 6:39.
How many smiles per gallon does it get?
peanut butter and jelly
Inside peanut butter outside jelly, 7 days of the week 7 different chevys (In this case dodges)
if only it wasnt just a 10 year old vehicle with a body kit and engine swap
Other dodge colors... SINamon stick and DESTROYER grey. They’re in your face and dodge customers love it
my 2004 BMW 320D i got for 3k last year has automatic wipers 😭
doug ab dodge ki taraf badh rahe hai,
You know, i wanted dodge to make a demon charger, but this is good.
Soon, there will be a Charger Demon with 808 HP followed by the Charger Satan with 909 HP
AMGGt63s: Relax
Cool color
Is that Dodge Durango at 0:28 is the next video's car?
to be honest it seems for 90 grand I get 800 hp hemi and a car for free
If you only drive straights, it's rly fast.  Just don't dare to go fast into a corner.
Is this his first ever weekend upload? Oh boy I'm excited for Dougcember
When Doug sees my balls 4:25
FCA has gone completely insane putting big Hemi Supercharged V8s in all their cars in this era of environmental awareness, fuel economy.   I Love it
✊More Power!✊
The 2021 Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat Redeye Is the World’s Fastest Sedan  Every other European automaker: ummmm ok
All I can say is inside peanut butter outside jelly....
11:00 Doug the type of guy that takes a Redeye down a dead end street
Doug Demuro: The 2021 Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat Redeye Is the World’s Fastest Sedan  Mercedes and BMW: hold my beer
8:55 MO POWAH BABEH  Sorry, wrong channel
So we have the press car for our new beast of a vehicle, what color should we paint it? Bright red? Matte black?   "Peanut butter and jelly sandwich"
No one :  Doug in 2050 : still calls cars and bids new
Why didn’t u post on the main
What kind of dog do you have, Doug?  Is it a Bearded Collie?
doug visited the same dodge RAM dealership lol . Ram TRX , Dodge Charger STR Hellcat Redeye , and the Durango SRT hellcat .
Is it me or am I the only one whose impressed at how much mileage FCA has squeezed out of a platform dating back from 2003?? The Charger/Challenger/300 were based on that platform from the 2008 model year. This nearly beats out the Chevrolet C3 Corvette (1968 - 1982), the Fox body Mustang (1979 - 1993), narrowly beats out the Z34 Nissan 370Z (2009 to present)! The modern longevity king, at least for relatively modern cars goes to the Panther platform from Ford for the Crown Victoria/Grand Marquis/Town Car (final model dated back to 1990 for the Town Car and 1992 for the Crown Vic and Grand Marquis which were all riding a body on frame platform dating back to 1979)! The Panther platform was discontinued after the 2011 model year.
I cant wait for doug to review ferrari roma !!!!
Imagine in 2030 apple's charger being more expensive than a dodge charger
Doug uploaded a video on Saturday.  Please upload the Durango review ASAP.   EDIT: He already reviewed the Durango since I posted THIIIIISSSSSSSS comment. Thank you Mr DeMuro.
Actually Doug my 09 Accord is the world’s fastest sedan. Get it right.
a stage 2 m5 comp  would wipe it's ass with this thing and it looks much better inside and out.
looks like he got in touch with fca
Who needs a rear view camera in a car like this anyway? What's behind me, is not important.
I was hoping doug would say "moe powa baby!"
Its beautiful 😍
the paint interior combo should be called "peanut butter jelly time!"
Doug, we love you Doug
so ya gonna act like the m5 e60 don't hold 206mph record stock N/A....m5 e60 hurricane runs 230mph...stop the caping
if you don't have the charger for your i phone 12 in the box, you can go out and get a dodge charger
Doug is the type of guy to drive a Dodge vehicle to go to Dodgeball Class.
He's wrong, the fastest sedan is actually any rental car.
Yo mama is a hell of a cat
One of the coolest cars out there right now. Not 100% sold on the widebody yet but still a monster of a vehicle.
Peanut butter and Raisins? Where's the celery for my ants on a log?
I'm sure if the F40 had 800bhp it would be faster than this tank....and I'm sorry to say it's not the fastest saloon in the world - that title belongs to the 207mph Bentley Flying Spur.
*Happy you're in Charlotte* !! *VERY cool* !!  *I lived in Charlotte for 20 years...* !! *LOVE the exterior color* !! #MoreDougDeMuro
Calendar Prawblems... Doug 🤔
Peanut butter jelly car
False, the fastest sedan is a rented Kia.
still slower than a tesla though :P at least from the launch
“Inside peanut butter, outside jellaaaaay” come on Doug
an awd version would be nuts from 0-100
my 2013 charger R/T has adaptive cruise control......
The PB&J  Slammed-which
Why is this on the "more" channel?
The fastest sedan is actually a rental with full insurance
I had an STI pinkeye 🤔
When you tell him to be frank, Doug is the type of guy to tell you that his name isn’t Frank
Thisssss is a Dodge Charger and thissssss is me
Anddd this colour is amazing
How is it faster than the Bently though?
Stupidest looking car I’ve ever seen
KANAV
Review an F1 car daddy Doug!!!!!!! And a private jet!
You can't help but worry when Doug is near a Hellcat 😆
hey doug! i just love watching your videos and i have been follwing you since you owned a nissan skyline.  hope to meet you one day!
Oh shit I’m early
Man, this color is AWESOME. Love that FCA is still doing interesting colors.
Good to see doug now knows how to drive
Rappers probably rushing to Dodge dealerships
This, is a Doug   DeMuro, and Its the Dougiest Doug that ever reviewed Cars, make sure to check out CarsAndBids.com
RESIST THE GREAT RESET FOR ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT BY KLAUS SCHWAB AND HIS PUPPET POLITICIANS
fastest saloon car in the world is the bentley flying spur W12
dodge has been pushing out so many insanely fast cars in the last few years
BEST sounding - looking sedan ever!
When you’re 17 years old, your used Chevy Cobalt is actually the fastest sedan
does it come with a gas station?
Have to go to More Doug to see something that isn't an SUV or a Pickup.
In terms of too speed, the ALPINA B5, B7 and Bentley Flying Spur are faster.
Plz do a review of the toyata mega Cruzer
It’s a Sunday but I’m not complaining.
Don’t worry guys Dominic will be driving this car for every Fast and Furious movie till the end, as it’s always been for the previous movies.
Love the color!!

Mercedes amg gts 4-door and other German sedans approves this...   Also I do prefer the sound of the charger tho....  American 1/4 mile are not always true u know....the Panamera does like 11 seconds in the 1/4 mile not sure if the redeye will do 10.6..the demon never did 9.6 at the quarter mile max was something like 9.8 , 9.9 etc.. I still love the redeye tho.
Dodge is milking the dead cow with these Hellcat versions.
“Fastest Sedan in the world”  Me looking at my Civic: It’s ok bud...you go when you want to go
