The way things are going in the UK it will soon be illegal if you just think it.
This is hilarious 😆
"Leakiest Maximus"😂😂😂😂
"It's not illegal if you just think it!" That line is both hilarious and terrifying.
*I'm sorry about the R number, Mr Cuddles* 😢😂😂
Gee who would've thought sunni rishak would become pm?
😂
Cummings spot on lol
I’m bloody well miffed lol 😂
It was Rishi
Rishi rishi rishi!!! Rishi rishi rishi!!!
I glad the speakers of the house told him to sit down it's not school you can't walk out. I sure he didn't use those words. Great show
That "Rishi Rishi Rishi" has been stuck in my head for a week now...lol
They made Boris so charming...sorta
Criminals and hosts.
Hancock with a dummy 🤣
Leakius Maximus
Ironically, Cummings is now leaking the tories uselessness.
👽👽👽
*Rishi Rishi Rishi*
6 months on Cummings is still needling them
Oh my God I just looked him up he really does look just like his puppet
Until the time of the swarming
"That freak Cummings has to go by christmas."  "Who leaked that?"  "Oh come on, it could have been anybody..."
I feel so sorry for Dominic having a last name like that......
“Boris annoyed by wibbling weasels” That was great😂
Rishi Rishi Rishi
I wish that Kay burley & Political editor Beth Rigby from Sky news
Rishi rishi rishi    Rishi rishi RISHI!!!!
I love how he floats around
I love how you just hear dominic levitate
This sounds pretty similar to tier 4 being leaked today before Boris announces it. Dominic didn't do good enough to stop the leaking.
Just like the last time round...  the puppets endure in my memory, long after I have forgotten the real politicians.   Case in point: David Steel!
I always thought Gove looked kinda odd. Now I realize his face is cock and bollocks.
The identity of real leaker is...        Michael Gove.  The evidence was in the sketch where Gove and Cummings went to a curry house as well as this.  He learnt that Dominic was an alien from Epsilon 5 and he tried to kill him with turmeric laced curry only so he can make his move against Boris.   But Dominic survived, via some rancid fry grease, and to prevent Boris from finding out his plan and well as continuing on from it, Gove leaked everything that Boris said, as well as that Cummings had to go by Christmas.  Don’t believe me, this sketch also had Gove being resistance to Dominic’s mind reading ability as well as his pocket knife having some kind of powder, likely Turmeric. He came prepared after the curry house.
Not that we’ll know, shoving it straight onto Britbox. Hope no license payers money was used making it
rishi rishi rishi.
who are these people even meant to be
" im sorry about the R number mister cuddles"..."meeaah meaahhh"
With some luck the rest of them will go too!
Rishi rishi rishi 😂😂😂🙂
I don't think you have the slightest idea about what is going on behind closed doors, and for that matter open doors aswell
0:45
Sunak looks like Dr Spock ffs 😂😂
What's really scary is that Spitting Image has always been satirical but now seems more like a documentary.
What a load of PC leftist crap, not a patch on the original show. Never even got a smile.
So will Priti Patel be joining Dominic Cummings on Epsilon 5 ..er... I mean Durham. Question is has Patel asked Johnson if he would sack her with Johnson's standard reply of "No I , I...don't think that will be necessary." There must be a link between Epsilon 5 and the White House. Too many odd and dangerous MPs and chiefs of staff for my liking. Can't wait for the Spitting Image take on this.
It's like if ad hominem was a series
Will there be a Jacob Rees-Mogg puppet?
I like the way it hints that Spamcock likes to be a baby 😩 😂😂😂😂😂
spitting image was the reason Dominic Cummings finally got sacked! they made him out to be an alien like, unempathetic, cold evil genius when in fact this is so wrong, he's not actually that clever.......
Mr Sunak is going to have to do a personality change from Father Christmas to the tax man.
Good old Marxist-Socialist Spitting Image...
Get rid of them all !!!! Crazies !!!!
Hancock dream the best
Guess Carrie is under the table ',:/
This is at least more accurate and the BBC
YET AGAIN -the left wing media make the tory party the brunt of their jokes BUT the irony is that the infighting  and imminant civil war within the Labour party  about antisemitism  resulting  suspension of the vile Corbyn hasnt even been mentioned  on this left-wing excuse of a tv program !!- so much for the  hypocritical and supposedly "impartial "  media !!
Ken's cold called Cummings: https://youtu.be/1ji1ROnBAR4
This looks like something you'd watch for the fun of seeing how dumb they are!!
Why is no one talking about Rishi Sunac? Hillarius
“One of you Wibbiling weezles.”
Lol need to watch this show
Goodbye forever dominic.
This "voodoo " parody technique is working great . Make an ugly doll of humanities worst politicians,  stream it to the masses, and within a few weeks , they're gone. Who needs Science and Elections  : -)

Hancock: I’m sorry about the R rate Mr Cuddles!
😄😄😄😄
😂😂😂😂
“Until the time of the swarming” I lost it 😂
1:09 weakness equals leakness, good pun.
https://youtu.be/13Vi4eLDlg0 into hell we go.
"Leaky-us maximus" Seriously love that phrase
Cummings was by far my favorite character!
"It's not illegal if you just think it."....unless you are in Scotland.
More true than funny. Cummings is a strange person.
I think Hancock actually was the leak.
The way Sunak says “in the form of a public sector contract” 💀😂
Maybe Cummings did leak? This nonsense with The GF is a smokescreen as Boris would lose even more credibility if it came out, having stood by him through the fiasco of blindgate....
The beginning of this is so funny for some reason angry Boris in spitting image is the best
This is about the level of the old Spitting Image when it was on its last legs. This needs to go the same way.
was Hanock sacrificed
What's going on with Rishi Sunak and Michael Gove's voices?  I get that Cummings sounds different/exaggerated because the joke is supposed to be that he is a creepy little alien man. But Sunak and Gove sound off-model for no reason. Boris' voice actor has done pretty well, and puppet-Hancock's voice isn't terrible (although that joke about him being chased by a frigging teddy bear was definitely lazy). Work on the rest.
The rona even got into the voting machines in the US elections. As Paul Daniels said : NOW THAT'S  MAGIC!
I'd feel safer with the puppets in charge
whos' the guy that looks like Spock supposed to be?  Cumming even called him by a Vulkan name.
Bye bye Demonic Cummings. Wonder how much insidious manipulation he'll wreak from the outside now... Gulp!
The original show was patchy at best, but this is plain embarrassing.
What a totally sick programme it is, loved of course by the ignorant Lefties !
The best part is the spittimg image versions of those people where more relatable than the original ones
Whos the mate with the glasses
i love boris
That thing dominic cummings does knocks me laughing 🤣🤣🤣
Dominic Cummings came back  minus 12, i mean dulam
Why no puppets of Liebbour and their anti semitism?
There’s just something about Cummings he’s dodgy, looks creepy in real life to haha
Gove's mind is like the swiss alps completely covering in snow and by snow I mean cocaine
its correct about hancock hes a winging baby from birth best bet for him is he needs his playroom and rattle.
Weakness equals leakness 😆
It's sad that the puppet Boris looks better and sounds smarter then the real one
Is there a Carrie puppet?
157 members of parliament clicked thumbs down 👎
Rishi looks like an asian Prince Charles
Epsolon 5👽🤣😂
Mr Cummings has managed to hand out £160 BILLION or all our taxes to his mates, and then disappear.  This is criminal and absolutely rediculous.  wtf is going on? Hancock is Just a filthy
IT APPEARS BORIS JOHNSON'S UP TO NO GOOD STARTED MAKIN TROUBLE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HE GETS IN ONE LITTLE FIGHT NOW HE'S RUNNING SCARED AND SAIS "HE'S MOVING IN WITH PARLIMENT & HANCOCK IN Z JAIL!”
Rishi still is the best looking among this ugly lot hahahaha
Pity it's not anywhere near as satirical or bitter and twisted as the 80s tv show.
Dominic Cummins definitely look like a evil Donald Pleasant in Wake in Fright.
I mean , how can spitting image be funny without Trump and Cummings?
Did they just call Michael Gove a Pedo XD
Why is no one talking about the bloody knife Gove pulled out?
What is the name of the outro song?
Funny show. But what isn’t funny how Boris and Starmer have sold out to Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates - unless of course you want to live in a fascist biosecurity police state. And all you dummies acquiescing to the scam.  Bravo !!
Fox News have done a Puppet of Nicola Sturgeon, they call it Hannity!
Overrated series, thought it would be a lot funnier than this shite
🤣🤣👍
Hackney Empire's 2016 panto coined the use of the word 'gove' as a common noun - the line was 'You are a treacherous gove' - I've been trying to popularise the use of the word so that, one day, it may be listed in the OED.
Anyone else think that this is absolutely dog sh**. I’ve watched a few scetches and never raised a smile. Terrible.
Spitting Image have lost their 2 best characters in the space of a week.
Dominic Cummings is the new Norman Tebbit.
S gs 20😅dks b dks d
Who would pay to see this crap??
Pish as usual
The Cummings and Goings of British Politics - what a farce it all is...
Spitting image, use to great now it’s just left wing propaganda skit made by bbc and co
He returned to his home planet... i mean his hometown which is epsilon 5... i mean Durham
I'm assuming that spitting image record their episode early? I always assumed they had already filmed all of the show.
It’s just shit.
No useless warmongering bidon ever. Shame its not covering more of the Woke loons.
Blustering Boris and his  Useless "Band of Clueless Dithering Brothers" should ALL be Sacked for THEIR TOTAL INCOMPETENCE and failure to stem the flow of the virus. Britain has now over FIFTY THOUSAND DEATHS from Covid and way TOO MANY families to apologise to but, look out further onto the Horizon, what do we see? Blustering Boris IS about to be SACKED and Mr Sunak is about to become the next Prime Minister. Poor old Boris. Not so long ago, he stated publicly that "I can't get by on ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR  .   .  "  My heart's Bleeding for him. Blustering  Boris was SET UP to take the fall for the pandemic failure. What a SHAMBLES OUR COUNTRY IS IN and, it's ALL down to your hard working Clueless Conservative Party 😢😢😢😢😢
Cummings may stick around if he opens his mouth to the hive  Let’s hope so
"Gotta check your thinking."
Ok
boris uses huawei bro i luv how spitting image is going into the details
"Rishi rishi rishi, rishi rishi rishi".... Great stuff!
Best part of Spitting Image
Okay, so erm this how our government work?
PCS - CRIB SESSIONS PT.1 https://youtu.be/8WJ7iv14ud4
This is better:  https://youtu.be/3piT9hy1Mn0
With cummings gone Brexit will probably be cancelled. Anyone else looking forward to burning London to the ground?
Lol just love this show. Proper piss taking banter is what we need now a days  with a world filled with snowflakes and wet noodles 😂
THANK YOU for bringing this back its fantastic :) last weeks queen swearing was just the best
LOL They all are Rats LOL  This show is mad & funny lol
Next will be a holographic image of Cummings from epsilon 5     from his space anomaly programme, like a type of cosmic haunting 😁👾🔭🎆
Aww, I was expecting him needing to go back to the mothership to flout the laws of his own land.
Dominic Cummings is like a slimy version of the Mekon in the Dan Dare comics.
Dead cat on the table time!
Anyone who's fool enough to swallow that pantomime of Cummings carrying his box out of the door of No 10..... He's still going to be right at the centre of things.
At least we'll never have to see the pulsating head effect again, or well, we hope not to anyway!
0% funny
The two Brexit MP's kicked out because Boris Johnson has a girl friend who is a remainer.  But you won't take the piss out of the Remainers are you are all the same.
I cannot get over how perfectly they've captured Dominic Cummings 😂
It's a shame this isn't on  normal TV instead of behind a paywall.
ooh that bloody knife brutal
Good grief that was quick.
Wonder what Cummings would reveal poking his fingers  in Abbots head or arse as pretty much the same just a large hole lol
I love how they portray Hancock.  Hilarious!
How quickly do these guys make these?!
ALAS
Ah..Gove at the end with his "political ninja knife!". Might of known!. Never try to read the mind of a Scot...let that be a lesson to you!.
"It's not illegal if you just think it"
Now there’s only the guy with the knife left. 😓  But he can obviously stay.
Noooo, don't get rid of Dom, he's one of my favorite characters in this
"Weakness equals leakness" 🤣
So funny lol
Dominic Cummings brings me out in hives.
Good news Liverpool only 233 positive cases of COVID out of 44,000 tests.
So do Spitting Image just have a sketch ready for every possibility or
Too funny!!!
It tu boris
Thank you corona for taking down Trump and now this rats!
Johnson will be next😂😂😂
Reverse psychology to soften the blow of whats soon to come. Dont be fooled by this trickery
Wibbling weasels lol
Love how govey pulls out a knife
Good riddance and hopefully the whole Government will be next and put up in front of the Houses of Parliment and jabbed with the 40 million doses of vaccine from Pfizer.  Utter shambolic set of individuals with no manners or morals.
He’s like Spock in Star Trek 👏😂
Ngl Cummings doing alien stuff is the funniest thing about his character. They just freaking deflate the puppet.
Life is much better (sigh of relief)
Yep Backstabber Gove
Absolute rubbish.
Now that Cummings is out...when do we expect Epsilon 5 to attack the UK?
Lets be honest no more trump is gonna be so boring....trump pence were great in spiting image.hope they dont remove trump
I have to say that the writing in this latest incarnation of SI is as clever and sharp as I remember it being the first time around. BJ and Cummings are just brilliant.
All the 'Leavers' are 'leaving' Boris just as soon as they think the shit is about to hit the fan at Christmas/New Year with the chaos ensuing of having actually left the EU... There are SO many THICK people in this country who voted ‘leave’;  when things go tits up for them, they’ll be squealing like pigs! LOL
I think we should launch an investigation to find out if cummings really is from epsilon 5 🤔
I'll give him another 3 months.
No trump? Is spitting image taking sides? This could hurt you, just keep doing comedy pls.
Gove with the knife.. lol
love how quick they get these sketches made
Boris learned from Trump's defeat
Rishi Sunaks nose HAHAHA
That is good. The rest of the shows were not.
There's Always  someone new  to target
Just brilliant ! Heartbroken he is leaving govt 😂😂😂
Rishi sounds more like Blair though.
i miss Dom already :(
Where’s not so pretty Patel 😂
Waiting for the episode were trump loses the election
Plus trump is still going to win anyway
Boris refuse to fire him for supposedly eating baby but sack him for investigating leaks
And how he must go his home plan... home county of Durham needs him.
What a snivelling little shite Hancock is 🤣
Is it bad that the Cummings head thing no longer creeps me out? I’m so used to it now.
Do you think all these guys watch this on the quiet on their own?
The first thing I did when I read that Cummings had left was check this channel...
Always the best
Yep that sums up our government and now that Cummings is gone get rid of the rest of them
Ayyyy itll be tough without these lying furkwits to abuse😑
John Major wanted Dominic Cummings to go or it would have messed the soft Brexit deal up
Bidens demntia infused gaffes will be perfect for spitting image i swear😂
I love spitting image I love Dominic Cummings puppet
Spitting Image. Here is your problem. The puppets of Biden and Zuckerberg look too nice (I am missing your spitting image satire). It shows that Spitting Image are a biased piece of [beep]. I am suggesting that you correct the puppets of those mentioned above towards their real ugliness, and create a Roger L or Spitting Image puppet. The latter could be a slimy disgusting monster that bends over to the champagne socialists who do not have people’s interest on their heart but seem to try to hurt by fraud and deception. You are really missing something, Spitting Image, and the a.hole you depicted belongs to the ones who we the people hate.
Yea but no but.........
Damm he was the best puppet by far!! Hope he still makes the show somehow!! Also hope he can move on and find peace in the future after the disgusting way he was treated by the scum media!!
Remember when the BBC wasn't a de-facto mouthpiece for the government and actually broadcasted this?
Oh God, the mind melding actually made me laugh. I’m concerned
Sailor is leaving sinking ship, captain will follow..
That was quick
That was a disappointingly tame look into Matt Hancock's mind.  Spoofing his power hungriness is an opportunity "Spitting Image" keeps missing.
This is the best one yet 😂
The rishi puppet looks more like prince charles !! Ha ha ..
Lol the best ever
Damn what’s up with Hancock?      Also, goodbye Dominic...
👽👾🚀🛸🐝🍯🐝💛💕🐝💛🐝👽👾🛸👽🛸💛🍯Cummings will disguise himself as an attractive Queen and own the hive.  He will use his charm because he knows those old sayings: "you catch more flies with honey and you get more honey when you're fly." 💛🐝💛🍯💛🐝🍯👽🛸👾🍯🐝💛🐝
I don't know who most of these people are, but the pols over there are MUCH more entertaining the the ones we've got in the States.
Cummings is by far the best character I hope they find someone to fill his shoes!
That didn’t take long! 😂😂😂😂
Arrest warrant awarded for matt wancock.. please cover this weasel being huckled
Huge mistake putting this on a pay channel
People’s Union of Britain v Matt Hancock | Application For Arrest Warrant Approved Posted on 13th November 2020 by The Bernician People’s Union of Britain v Matt Hancock | Application For Arrest Warrant Approved COVID-1984 NEWSFLASH | The prosecution in People’s Union of Britain v Matt Hancock has just sent the executed form, applying for his arrest warrant, to the court of issue.  We have already got the green light from the court’s legal advisers and now we have the chief magistrates’ permission to proceed. They also sent us the form to fill out for the arrest warrant, which has now been acknowledged by the same as having been received.  However, the form won’t be processed till Monday, when it will be sent up to the crown court to be administered and then served upon Hancock, without delay, by the arresting officers, who will soon be appointed by the court.  Therefore, the case will now proceed as directed, unless the Director of Public Prosecutions [DPP] intervenes, which is unlikely because nobody will want to take the poisoned chalice.  However, even if they do, we can object on the ground that the DPP is working for the government, so they are obviously conflicted. If they refuse to back down, we will insist that the case proceeds with our legal team.  In other words, my family, friends and growing army of peace-keepers and freedom fighters, we are all about to witness the most significant events that have transpired on these shores, since Charles I lost his head.  Words simply cannot adequately express the truly humbling experience of the love, support and commitment I’ve received, from people who all tell me that my words have moved and inspired their hearts into resisting this tyranny, for the sake of our children and grandchildren.  Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for rising to the call. Very soon, our number will be millions.  This truly is our moment to seize the opportunity to build an advanced civilisation, on the rubble of the corrupted one, which is crumbling around us by COVID-1984 design.  In other words, fuck the great reset, the fourth industrial revolution and fraudulent debt based slavery.  In that new civilisation, we will protect the unalienable birthrights of the individual from the tyranny of the collective, to become truly self-governed under the Common Law, as expressed in Magna Carta 2020, an idea whose time has come.  From now until you see the arrest live-streamed on the mainstream and alternative media worldwide, let’s make #ArrestMattHancock go viral on every platform, to the point where the People are chanting it in the streets nationwide.  Related Posts
Love Rishis puppet   Matt Hancock’s puppet is a bit lacking ;  He’s not cunty enough
TBH I don't get the hate for Dominic. All he did was travel to his parents house and in the grand scope of things - it's not that big a big deal. Whereas there are people that are throwing house parties / going abroad etc. To me, that's worse! -_-
Let's hope he sings like a spiteful, revenge crazed canary and brings the dung heap, and all its faux  tory turds, crashing down...taking the loony labour left out at the same time would be nice, but I'm not greedy.
Brilliant video
Ask yourself how come a TV program can predict what’s going on ? It’s all a script being played out wake up people !!!!!!!!
NOOOOO anyone but Dominic Cummings
yawn
Trump was my favourite character 😢
You know the world has really gone to shit when Spitting Image comes out of the mothballs to get in on the slaughter.
...aaaaaaaand gone. :^D
Just watched Boris being interviewed about his impersonation on Spitting Image: He was more incoherent than the puppet!
50,000 dead, not funny
Whoever came up with Doms head is a genius 👊
Plot twist boris tells the news everything
"I'm sorry about the R number Mr Cuddles"
Cummings life is in his box
Forgot to laugh
Dominic is so evil, just look at him, certainly not from Planet Earth....!
its the hancock one that gets me
Wow, that was fast.
Given his leaving was prompted by a dispute with Carrie, perhaps she overheard his plans to eat her baby... (which he's threatened to do several times over the course of the series) ... or Govey (no longer in Paris) outwitted him...
Micheal gove is officially my favourite character
The hive   :)  This show is brilliant!
Excellent
I was going to be very pissed off if they didn’t make a video on this!!!!
Is this meant to be funny?
Wow this was quickly done! Well done all! I doubt this is the last we’ll see of Dom!
🤣🤣🤣🤣...interesting timing or prediction from spitting image..
I hope this show last long enough for them to make a puppet of me
Wow they’re quick
Missed a trick with twat cockinhand, should be shown in a Nazi uniform or are ypu to scared to show the truth?
What a load of shite this programme is, as funny as toothache
Well that was quick.
My goodness, they make new episodes based on breaking news... D: D: D:
wow its only just been announce and yet spitting image has already done an episode? seems someones been leaking the info to them first?
Bloody awesome that, thanks 👍
Two of the best characters gone already
Fans of this show will like this bad ass documentary. https://youtu.be/PIRkGCXm3_c
My only complaint with the no 10 skits is that Rishi Sunat just doesn't snivellingly posh enough.
The devil works fast, but Spitting Image works faster.
Hahahaha
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. Whether you show what is within yourselves or conceal it, Allah will bring you to account for it. Then He will forgive whom He wills and punish whom He wills, and Allah is over all things competent. Al-Baqarah 2:284 English - Sahih International   English - Tafsir ibn kathir Would the Servants be Accountable for What They Conceal in Their Hearts   Allah says;   لِّلَّهِ ما فِي السَّمَاواتِ وَمَا فِي الَارْضِ وَإِن تُبْدُواْ مَا فِي أَنفُسِكُمْ أَوْ تُخْفُوهُ يُحَاسِبْكُم بِهِ اللّهُ فَيَغْفِرُ لِمَن يَشَاء وَيُعَذِّبُ مَن يَشَاء وَاللّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ      To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth, and whether you disclose what is in yourselves or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it.  Allah states that His is the kingship of the heavens and earth and of what and whoever is on or between them, that He has perfect watch over them. No apparent matter or secret that the heart conceals is ever a secret to Him, however minor it is.  Allah also states that He will hold His servants accountable for what they do and what they conceal in their hearts.  In similar statements, Allah said,  قُلْ إِن تُخْفُواْ مَا فِى صُدُورِكُمْ أَوْ تُبْدُوهُ يَعْلَمْهُ اللَّهُ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَمَا فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَاللَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ  Say (O Muhammad):"Whether you hide what is in your breasts or reveal it, Allah knows it, and He knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth. And Allah is able to do all things) (3:29)  and,   يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ وَأَخْفَى   He knows the secret and that which is yet more hidden. (20;7)   There are many other Ayat on this subject.  In this Ayah (2:284), Allah states that He has knowledge of what the hearts conceal, and consequently, He will hold the creation accountable for whatever is in their hearts. This is why when this Ayah was revealed, it was hard on the Companions, since out of their strong faith and conviction, they were afraid that such reckoning would diminish their good deeds.  Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said,  "When    To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth, and whether you disclose what is in yourselves or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it. Then He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. And Allah is able to do all things.  was revealed to the Messenger of Allah, it was very hard for the Companions of the Messenger.  The Companions came to the Messenger and fell to their knees saying, `O Messenger of Allah! We were asked to perform what we can bear of deeds:the prayer, the fast, Jihad and charity. However, this Ayah was revealed to you, and we cannot bear it.'  The Messenger of Allah said,  أَتُرِيدُونَ أَنْ تَقُولُوا كَما قَالَ أَهْلُ الْكِتَابَيْنِ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ سَمِعْنَا وَعَصَيْنَا بَلْ قُولُوا سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا غُفْرَانَكَ رَبَّنَا وَإِلَيْكَ الْمَصِير  Do you want to repeat what the People of the Two Scriptures before you said, that is, `We hear and we disobey!' Rather, say, `We hear and we obey, and we seek Your forgiveness, O our Lord, and the Return is to You.  When the people accepted this statement and their tongues recited it, Allah sent down afterwards,  امَنَ الرَّسُولُ بِمَا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْهِ مِن رَّبِّهِ وَالْمُوْمِنُونَ كُلٌّ امَنَ بِاللّهِ وَمَليِكَتِهِ وَكُتُبِهِ وَرُسُلِهِ لَا نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِّن رُّسُلِهِ وَقَالُواْ سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا غُفْرَانَكَ رَبَّنَا وَإِلَيْكَ الْمَصِيرُ   The Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They say,) "We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers ـ and they say, "We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all)." (2:285)   When they did that, Allah abrogated the Ayah (2:284) and sent down the Ayah,  لَا يُكَلِّفُ اللّهُ نَفْسًا إِلااَّ وُسْعَهَا لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَعَلَيْهَا مَا اكْتَسَبَتْ رَبَّنَا لَا تُوَاخِذْنَا إِن نَّسِينَا أَوْ أَخْطَأْنَا  Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned. "Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error," until the end." (2:286)   Muslim recorded it with the wording;  "When they did that, Allah abrogated it (2:284) and sent down,  لَا يُكَلِّفُ اللّهُ نَفْسًا إِلااَّ وُسْعَهَا لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَعَلَيْهَا مَا اكْتَسَبَتْ رَبَّنَا لَا تُوَاخِذْنَا إِن نَّسِينَا أَوْ أَخْطَأْنَا  Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned. "Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error." (2:286)   Allah said, `I shall (accept your supplication),'  رَبَّنَا وَلَا تَحْمِلْ عَلَيْنَا إِصْرًا كَمَا حَمَلْتَهُ عَلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِنَا   "Our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that which You did lay on those before us (Jews and Christians)" (2:286)   Allah said, `I shall (accept your supplication),'  رَبَّنَا وَلَا تُحَمِّلْنَا مَا لَا طَاقَةَ لَنَا بِهِ   "Our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear." (2:286)   Allah said, `I shall (accept your supplication),'  وَاعْفُ عَنَّا وَاغْفِرْ لَنَا وَارْحَمْنَأ   أَنتَ مَوْلَانَا فَانصُرْنَا عَلَى الْقَوْمِ الْكَافِرِينَ  "Pardon us and grant us forgiveness. Have mercy on us. You are our Mawla (Supporter and Protector) and give us victory over the disbelieving people." (2:286)   Allah said, `I shall."'  Imam Ahmad recorded that Mujahid said,  "I saw Ibn Abbas and said to him,  `O Abu Abbas! I was with Ibn Umar, and he read this Ayah and cried.'  He asked, `Which Ayah?'  I said,  وَإِن تُبْدُواْ مَا فِي أَنفُسِكُمْ أَوْ تُخْفُوهُ  (And whether you disclose what is in yourselves or conceal it).  Ibn Abbas said, `When this Ayah was revealed, it was very hard on the Companions of the Messenger of Allah and worried them tremendously. They said:O Messenger of Allah! We know that we would be punished according to our statements and our actions, but as for what occurs in our hearts, we do not control what is in them.'  The Messenger of Allah said,  قُولُوا سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا  Say, `We hear and we obey.'  They said, `We hear and we obey.'  Thereafter, this Ayah abrogated the previous Ayah,  امَنَ الرَّسُولُ بِمَا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْهِ مِن رَّبِّهِ وَالْمُوْمِنُونَ كُلٌّ امَنَ بِاللّهِ  (The Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allah), until,  لَا يُكَلِّفُ اللّهُ نَفْسًا إِلااَّ وُسْعَهَا لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ  (Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned). (2:285-286)   Therefore, they were pardoned what happens in their hearts, and were held accountable only for their actions."'  The Group recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,  إِنَّ اللهَ تَجَاوَزَ لِي عَنْ أُمَّتِي مَا حَدَّثَتْ بِهِ أَنْفُسَهَا مَالَمْ تَكَلَّمْ أَوْ تَعْمَل  Allah has pardoned my Ummah for what they say to themselves, as long as they do not utter it or act on it.  The Two Sahihs recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,  قَالَ اللهُ إِذَا هَمَّ عَبْدِي بِسَيِّيَةٍ فَلَا تَكْتُبُوهَا عَلَيهِ فَإِنْ عَمِلَهَا فَاكْتُبُوهَا سَيِّيَةً وَإِذَا هَمَّ بِحَسَنَةٍ فَلَمْ يَعْمَلْهَا فَاكْتُبُوهَا حَسَنَةً فَإِنْ عَمِلَهَا فَاكْتُبُوهَا عَشْرًا  Allah said (to His angels),  "If My servant intends to commit an evil deed, do not record it as such for him, and if he commits it, write it for him as one evil deed.  If he intends to perform a good deed, but did not perform it, then write it for him as one good deed, and if he performs it, write it for him as ten good deeds.  get Quran App:   #GreentechApps
it could be anyone... lol
Wow, Spitting Image was quick
But I have to say the alien is one of the best characters in this season. Such a shame to say goodbye too soon
Will be missing him on Spitting Image lol.
You guys should upload the ‘Fox Man’ clips
I'm so annoyed about Cummings leaving but somehow managed to get to this. I cannot keep a straight face. LMAO
‘Until the time of the swarming!’
It will be sad to see Cummings leave Spitting Image!
Made today and already out of date ;-]
Three good things have happened this week: -- Trump is out -- Vaccine has been found -- CUMMINGS HAS FINALLY PISSED OFF
bacl home to epselon 5
lol Sunak looks like Leonard Nimoy here!
I think Cummings is my fav character out of the new Spitting Image
They should treat them like horses and boil them down for glue
**EPSELON 5 aka DURHAM**
you guys are really deferent to Labour's jew hater.
RISHI RISHI RISHI
i absolutly love your videos
Looks like Dominic finally ate Boris's baby...
Spitting image restarts in the same year we lose trump and Cummings THANK YOU SPITTING IMAGE THE TRUE HEROES OF 2020 XD
Damn, I'll miss him.  He's a favorite.
*Left or Right Comment Your Godly Fight*  Who’s Alex Jones ?
*You Must Say “Wibbling Weasels” in your head at least Twice, haha*
Please let him go to Mars and join with Elon, he's the best puppet!
Spitting Image got a video for every political scenario lol
hahaahaha
✔️
I hope they don’t get rid of the puppet the real one can go though
Nice video
That was the shortest political documentary I've ever seen. I was wondering why we're in another lockdown. ( so quite out there lol) It's not the virus,it's the complete lunatics in charge.
Covid is ongoing - now with added vaccines - but - these will take months to distribute to a point where any positive effect occurs - a story to watch as its expected that after a few hundred have been vaccinated the Government will declare covid gone so back to normality don't worry about the bodies in the gutter. However - if no mink mutation becomes prevalent, and vaccination goes according to plan with a million a week (no chance), there should be relative normality by late summer to autumn 2021. The economy is ticking over on its war footing and Brexit is expected to be a disaster now Johnson hasn't the fallback of Trump to rely upon. Biden is expected to be the old style traditional Democrat with strong Irish Republican ties and a focus upon European exports which means the UK is less than relevant. Additional trade agreements appear not to be going well for the UK
DOMINIC GOINGS
Spitting Image is losing its best characters left and right!  First Trump now Cummings.
Ha ha ha, lol! Please may I ask, is this 1 of Mr Jeremy Bernard Corbyn as Father Christmas and he receives Freedom, Justice and Democracy etc?! Thank you
Damn, you guys are fast.
Rumbled boris
Lmao@ all of it😂
Wait I thought Hancock was killed? :rofl:
Goves cheeks are like two testicles. Only fitting, since there are plenty of nobs in the room
first legitimately funny clip
Dominic wanted to eat baby Boris and Jhonson chose his girlfriend over the eye tester    Buahahahhaha
"It's not illegal if you just think it" well maybe in Australia it isn't, but you cant say that about the UK anymore can you?  🤣
That was quick
American with no knowledge of British politics. Context on characters and overall popularity?
People who creates spitting image have every possible scenario filmed I reckon they've already got one done for when B Johnson leaves.
I thought they killed Hancock back on Halloween?
He is one of the best characters in this show :(
Who's the adult baby??  😂
More leeks than in wales get Don in the castle!!
Sunaks first appearance in spitting image?
How the hell do they get these out so fast
Mission accomplished Dominic. Greetings from Russia.
"it's not illegal if you just think it" - testi Gove    Who else is scared
😂
A so corrupt government to kill millions of people off
would have been funny if they showed him leaving downing street in his spaceship back to his planet.
Fuck that was quick 😂
New plot for the series:  Cummings can still appear ! But on his ufo... endlessly plotting against the Tories from his base on epsilon 5 😂
A pity that spitting image will have to retire the dreaded Dominic Cummings image. But I assume Boris finds a replacement that is at par or lower in the likeability department.
This is a George RR Martin moment.
I hope Dominic becomes a staple of the shoe after his resignation. Would hate to see our Hive Queen leave us for Epislon V
Sunak's puppet looks like Prince Charles if he'd been picking fruit in Andalusia for the summer.
“I have to go now. My planet needs me.”
Sunak takes out his hairbursh Hancock takes out his dummy Gove takes out his backstabbing knife I died at that point 😂😂😂😂
Fast
That was fast.
That ending made me genuinely laugh out louder then I should have
Boris’ hair deserves it own show
😂😂😂😂🤣🤣👌👌👍👍👍
Shit, they did this quick! Gove's bloody knife! Hahahaha Perfect!  Sniveling little turd.
That was quick!  Pretty sure Spitting Image is directed (or leaked to) by BoJoke!
Heheh they know what they're all about, top marks SI
I’ll miss Dominic’s puppet
Scanning Govey's brain ahh electric shock 🤯 this one must be full of shit 😯 using a Nigel farage translation app in France 🙄
Brilliant! Let's hope there is no cumming back
Rishi rishi rishi Rishi rishi rishi
Anyone else think these are getting better?
How do you freaking make this so fast hahaha
How do they make them this quick!? 😂😂
They get it so right and it’s scary to think our county is being run by puppets
it's getting better
Cumming’s looks like Rygel from Farscape.
The end of an era. Gonna miss alien Dominic Cummings.
You can't polish a Gove
They're getting rid of characters faster than on Game of Thrones now.
Gove has bollocks as cheeks! 🤣
The torture domes of epsilon 5, I mean Russia, Durham!
How do these make these like 1 hour after the news comes out??
I really hope they keep Cummings in Spitting Image even after he leaves Downing Street! He’s just too good 🤣
The scottish one has a knife lol.
Trump gone now Cummings sketches won't be as funny now.
Next week on Spitting Image. Joe Bidens dogs sick Trump..
It was very swift to publish! Congratulations! I love your work.
Love it!
When I saw on the news Dominic was leaving No. 10, I couldn't wait to see what Spitting Image was going to do with it!
Leakius maximus
Im so happy about it in real life but now we will never see that amazing dominic cummings puppet again 😪😪😭
Wow so quick- bravo!
Bye, Dominic, no one will remember you when you're dead
Finally, Cummings is gone
Brilliant, I'll be sad to see cummings leave because he's one of my  favorite characters on spitting image
Weakness equals leakness 😂😂😂 served up  SO SOON, 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Looks like President Trump is going to win. Sorry liberal slime
Yep see ya dom  , dont let the door hit you in the arse on the way out.
Weak , needs better writers and funny men/women impressionists.
What will the PM do for brains now?  He does not believe in anything.
I knew you would make this
Tory MP's will now comment that they back him going and that it's the right thing for the government or something like that, when 6 months ago most backed him up with his eye test
Spitting Image ...'it can be rather nasty', but oh boy, does boldly directed cutting humour help me get by these days.   Shit's n' giggles, brash and bold, makes my brain raise me eyebrow ...2020 Scrimmage, ta
Just noticed that the Dominic Cummings puppet has Cookie Monster's exact same googly eyes.
Brilliant!
Legend has it Spitting image are faster than the speed of sound.
No trump, now no Cummings. Spitting image won't be the same without the pair.
Absolute crap
Just not funny.
🤣🤣
I'm just waiting now for some bright spark to burn parliament to the ground that would make a great Christmas whilst listening to talking heads, burning down the house of course. Or maybe fire starter. Nov 2020 😂😅 😃🤣 🙄🤪🔥🔥🔥🔥
Trump and Dominic Cummings were the best characters please send them to Mars to control the poo pot smoking billionaires.
But where is he leaving to?  A-  Epsilon 5  B-  Russia   C-  Durham D- Other (Please specify)
Left No. 10 and travelling back to Epsilon 5.
I am happy I came across this channel lol
show my videos please!!!
The Spitting Image take on Cummings was sublime. It is almost a shame that he has gone.
That was class .... hahaha lol
Really funny video spitting image is brilliant!
Best of luck to Mr Cummings, the -remainer- rejoiner's boogeyman, in his future endeavours. His achievements are immense and all being told he is an interesting man interested in interesting ideas and absolutely antithetical to the one dimensional thinking that plagues political discourse.
That was flipping fast.
Go on Mr Cuddles, get Hancock!! He must be punished for the R number.
CRKEY you guys are on form, he's just been chucked out today LOL Friday 13th was bad for him
Love it 🤣
What a waste of a perfectly good puppet
Rofl ffs
How is this so soon!?!?
I like how they mock everyone but go savage on Michael Gove lol
I think they are taking on at Durham Tesco. Goodbye gobshite.
Gove and the knife is priceless
You guys are insanely fast haha
My favourite character leaving :(
good to see hancock recovered from having his heart tore from his body
First time that I noticed Goves cheeks are actually balls xD
At last he's off to Ypsilon 5.....
No ones tired of this. ?
No! Don't go!  I don't know what's going in in England, but I enjoy this puppet.
God that was quick.....
They all should go by Christmas
Why do TV shows get rid of the best characters? Bring back Cummings!
"i have no mates! ...until the time of the swarming."
That was quick.
Fantastic. Great episode. I haven't seen an episode featuring the Victorian lad I mean  Rees Mogg
Nice to see Matt got his transplant
ding dong the witch is dead
It's just not funny. Old SI used to be about over exaggeration and showing you things you didn't know about politians and celebrities. But we already know these guys act like this so there's no "omg I can't believe it. I thought there was something off about them."
That was quick haha
Dominic Goings.
What I wished for!
Nahh, so much potential, didnt happen.
Rishi sunak  looks like the creepy puppet in the teletubbies
I think they got rid of him because spitting image worked out he was an alien
Nooo dont kick Dom out, how will we learn how basic Hive maintenance works, where larvae flourish best. He can not go!
The leaker must have sent the government this script.
Shame really, I really enjoyed the way they spoofed Cummings!
Dominic's puppet looks like a better version of his real self
"epsilon, I mean Russia, I MEAN DURHAM"
how is a all star cast of so many people coming up with such utter basic 6 year old shit... you can litreally feel the writers getting squeezed of all originality at the top... fuck TV.. internet is the way forward
If he watched this no wonder he quit
so so funny. I love it !
My only regret about Cummings being kicked out (the Xmas resignation has just been upgraded to an immediate sacking), is that he was the best Spitting Image character!
It's like an episode of The Apprentice.
Hair by Rishhhhhi de Londres...
"Hmmm...My mind-meld fuse blew."   LMAO...Of COURSE the malfunction would happen with Govey!
This is an on the fly documentary, telling history as it unfolds.
Trump is dead on
That Freak Cummings has to go by Christmas , who leaked that? xD Balling!
"It shall be crowded in the hive tonight! "  (Head pulsates to sound of Theramin) 🏆🇬🇧👽
Still not funny, and never will be.
so now its funny people are out of work due to coronoa.. spitting image. WHAT A JOKE
How did they make it so fast 😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👍
Haha
Epsilon 5 beckons..... Well done S.I. - that was a quick turnaround.
I have no mates until the time of the swarming.....😆
Damn. Hes my favorite from the new series
Wow this was fast! Some really talented writers.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
The puppets are brilliant, the writing not so much, it used to be so much more savage, sign of the times maybe
he left an hour ago... how tf
Now he’s gonnings
"It's not illegal if you just think it". Yep, that's sounds like Gove to me.
At least Boris's baby is safe now (that's a good thing as long as he doesn't end up like Boris)
Dominic Goings!
Jesus... you're fast. 😂😂
He has to go back to Epsilon 5, wait I meant Russia, no I meant Durham
Jesus Christ I didn’t think the head squashing could get any better but now he quivers a bit and that’s the cherry on top
How Hancock came back from the dead?
Dominic has gone back to his home planet.
U can’t be getting rid of the best character.
Glad that wankers gone!   Oh and that’s hilarious that Boris thinks his puppet looks like Bjon Borg! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Well done for keeping up with the news. Question is did Dominic Cummings eat the baby?
The only sad thing about Cumming leaving is we won't get any more appearances from his superior Epilson 5 counterpart
Brill
😹😹😹😹😹😹
Hancock lol
So long Dom! Back to Epsilon 5.
He has gone back to the hive.
Another excellent skit!
Shame, they spent a shedload on his puppet, now it's as pointless as the original.
🍾 we wont miss you
Rishi Rishi Rishi Rishi
“It’s not illegal if you just think it”  Lmao
Goodbye, Dominic. Goodbye forever
Matt lmao 🤣
I'm your new adviser Boris!
They got that out quick enough seeing he only left about an hour ago
Cummings is the hero we need, but don't deserve.
First comment
